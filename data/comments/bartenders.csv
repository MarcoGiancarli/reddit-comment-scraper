bartenders,3e415f,fortyninecents,2,Wed Jul 22 08:41:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not defending this in any way, I'm just confused on how the bartender will have to pay tax /on this particular sale/. I understand that most bartenders have a bar back and/or door guy that they wind up tipping out at the end of the night, but that's not a government mandated tax, and every bar I've worked in (granted, it's only been 3), the tip out to support staff was based off of tips in hand. Servers, however, do tip out the bar based on alcohol sales, in my experience. So there's that. Is that the point you're making?  Or is it the case in some states (or other places, not America) that you happen to be taxed on a percentage of your sales, not your hourly wage + tips claimed? I'm in Texas, I've been bar tending for 8 years, and I've never been required to pay a tax on a tip I didn't receive."
bartenders,3e415f,WeAreAlsoTrees,1 point,Wed Jul 22 08:00:56 2015 UTC,"you are taxed at the rate of your income which is federal minimum wage. Establishments officially pay server minimum IF and ONLY IF the server doesn't claim tips that make up the difference.  In most instances the house will pay taxes on the sales of employees and this number has been hovering around 8% of the sale.  Usually this is eaten by the house or rolled into the cost of the item to make things simple for guest.    the IRS has special rules for tipped employees and i can't seem to articulate the way that the rules apply to the house vs. the employee but you do pay income tax and for many f&b it's directly related to tips claimed which we all roll into an hourly that is based on tips earned. A service provided without gratuity is time wasted, tips unclaimed and money spent by the house potentially to recover the lost wages to the employee thus putting them into the ""paid employee"" category if the money isn't made up by other gratuities which it almost ALWAYS is.   if you average less than the federal minimum taxed percentage is you're vulnerable for audit and the house has to cover the extra taxes applied to the wages you've earned.  The house doesn't do this and typically penalizes the employee in my experience.  15% is what the IRS expects you to claim from what i've learned the years over.  If you make less, you are still taxed at that rate i believe and can lose money on a sale in that instance.  this is 95% anecdote as i'm not an accountant."

bartenders,3e415f,Pinionedspiral,1 point,Wed Jul 22 10:25:31 2015 UTC,no they wont.  I see this from service industry people all the time.  There's a shitload of tips you don't report.
bartenders,3e415f,T_P_H_,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:19:16 2015 UTC,"My restaurant automatically reports 100% of my credit card tips, plus 100% of the tip share I receive from the waitstaff. Ironically, this tip share is supposed to offset my lowered wage, but since it is claimed along with all of my credit card tips, my wages get taxed to the point where my paycheck averages out to roughly $10 a week, for a 30 hour work week. And if that weren't enough, the system also calculates the percentage of the tips I have received on my credit cards sales, and then automatically claims that percentage on my cash sales. To explain, if I have $100 in credit card sales and receive $20 in tips on those sales, my tip percentage equals 20%.  So if I have an additional $100 in cash sales, but receive zero tips from those sales, the system still claims that additional $20 on top of everything else it has already claimed. The vast majority of tips are coming via credit card, so there isn't much room for unreported earnings. This depends on many factors of course, but that is my experience.  Edit: When the system calculates the tips from my cash sales, I do have the ability to change the amount. However, it will not let me claim less than 10% tips on my overall cash sales, regardless of whether or not I actually received tips on those sales."

bartenders,3e415f,Mitch_from_Boston,4,Tue Jul 21 20:53:53 2015 UTC,"I feel like the outcome in Anglo-Saxon cultures (US, UK mainly) of this kind of thing will be to remove the possibility of ""big"" tips -- everyone might pay a 5-10% tip when it's worth it for a proper dine-out meal, but the rest of the time won't bother. The end result will be, whilst you're saved from no-tip assholes, you're also prevented from the possibility of that random $100 tipper who pays your rent that week (for example).  That said, I think ultimately the problem with minimum wages in this industry is our society's attitude to people who execute food service and production. A lot of people think of it as ""not a real job"", a filler job, something you go to university to avoid -- in France, where the cost of service is incorporated into menu prices and is legally mandated to go straight into servers' pockets, hospitality in restaurants, hotels, and bars is seen as a vocation, a profession, as much as teaching for instance. I like this attitude. I think an attitude change would be vital for any kind of minimum wage laws to work out for the best. As it is, I fear it'll reduce real income for servers whilst giving asshats like this an excuse."
bartenders,3e415f,kbakermemphis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:02:31 2015 UTC,"True but higher wages also mean higher spending power. They aren't foolish, everyone should be able to live off of minimum wage, like it was in the '50's (the good ol' days). The trickle down theory doesn't work and has been proven not to work for 60 years, the only other option is to give people a liveable income. Kind of drunk right now but if you'd like to have a reasonable debate about this I can provide you with some figures tomorrow or the next day."

bartenders,3e3ft1,sarahmedlin,8,Tue Jul 21 17:38:47 2015 UTC,"What are the other girls wearing there?  What was the person training you wearing?  Sexy usually translates to revealing a bit more on either the top or the bottom, but not both, which may cross the line.  You can also go with more body conscious, figure flattering, rather than low cut or showing skin.  If tight clothing isn't your thing, loose tops that might hint at reveals work too, without feeling as ""on display"".  Whatever you wear, if you aren't accustomed to such attire, be ready to handle the compliments or catcalls you are likely to get, and if possible turn those into sales opportunities."
bartenders,3e3ft1,RJFerret,10,Tue Jul 21 18:01:48 2015 UTC,"Wear something low cut in the front & all black from head to toe. Black is slimming & sexy. If you're also one of those fortunate ones who's naturally skinny, where skintight clothing, but try to stick to cotton. When it gets busy, you're gonna get hot, cotton breathes better.  As far as shoes, well I must insist on ""NO"" heels of any sort. You wear them, you'll regret it. I highly reccomend ""Non Slip"" shoes. You could spend the ""$"" on ""Shoes For Crews"" great shoes, but pricey. Or do what I do, go to Payless Shoes & get the ""Safe T Step"" shoes in black. (I buy the tennis shoe ones, approx. $35). I also buy gel inserts (from the drugstore) so that they are a bit more comfy. Trust me, you're gonna appreciate ""Non Slip"" shoes when dealing with wet floors, which is very, very common.

Trust me, you'll want them. Also you want something with pockets. I keep my wine key, speed opener and pens in my back pockets at all times. I also always always ALWAYS wear non-slip shoes that are comfortable. Shoesforcrews.com has a really good selection, and I've found some awesome work sketchers that are non-slip and water resistant on zappos.com. Boots and other shoes look cute and can really pull off a look but think about it. From the other side of the bar who is really going to be looking at your feet? You're behind the bar. As someone who has been bartending for 7-8 years, trust me. You'll want comfort over sexy after your first few shifts.   As for a top I've found that tank tops are awesome, cheap, durable and just sexy/casual enough to pull off at work. Your shirt WILL get juice, booze, beer, food, etc all over it. It'll get holes in it. You don't want to spend a lot of money on your shirts.  Also try not to wear anything with long sleeves, or really long loose jewelery. They'll get caught on bottles, knock over glassware and slow you down. If you wear sleeves try to make sure they are 3/4 length because you will be washing your hands a LOT and your arms are going to get wet and sticky."

As for dressing ""sexy"" - be yourself and be comfortable. Don't invest in corsets and cut-offs because other girls wear or suggest them. You can achieve ""sexy"" with a simple outfit by putting extra effort into makeup, hair, and accessories.   Honestly, the ONLY thing I would invest in are shoes. Good shoes last for years and support your poor body as you drag it through long shifts. Treat yo self and get some nice shoes."

bartenders,3e3ft1,gravylookout,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:47:05 2015 UTC,"What kind of bar is it? More of a sports bar or a night club?  I work at a sports bar, during the week/weekend day shifts I stick to black v-necks (I'm on the bustier side), black skinny jeans and boots, or shorts and converse in the summer.  Weekend nights I'll wear a black cotton dress that either shows lots of cleavage or lots of ass, both is too much. I'm addicted to American Apparel and swear by their dresses and deep v-neck shirts. Forever 21 is great if you don't want to spend a lot on things you're just going to spill Fireball all over.  Gel inserts for the shoes are a must, and since I usually don't have pockets I'll keep my beer key strapped to my arm with a wristband. The most important thing is to make sure you're comfortable in what you're wearing! Constantly making adjustments/looking in the mirror is never attractive."
bartenders,3e3ft1,heckmanshoppers,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:46:32 2015 UTC,"Totally depends on the type of bar. Sexy means very different outfits if it's a sports bar where the bartenders wear cutoff football jerseys and athletic short-shorts vs. an upscale hotel bar where sexy means a clingy, expensive-looking dress and jewelry. Without knowing more about the venue, start your first shift or two just wearing what you are comfortable with, then after you have observed the clientele and staff more, combine your own style with what your most successful co-workers wear. From there you will figure out your own comfort level. Expect to be hot, dirty, and sweaty, if it is at all fast-paced."
bartenders,3e3ft1,val_hollaaaaa,2,Tue Jul 21 23:53:01 2015 UTC,"I usually wear black skinny jeans, black boots, and black/navy/dark colored tops. Trust me, don't wear light colors, you'll have a grenadine stain on that shit before happy hour is over.   I'm a big fan of Palladium leather boots, I bought mine at Goodwill for $20 and I think they are $100 new. The key with boots is not to buy cheap ones that will break, allow liquid to seep in and/or won't be slip-resistant. Buy a quality pair of used boots or spend the money and they will pay for themselves by allowing you to move faster and more safely. Sometimes I will bartend in Converse if I don't mind having my feet get wet.    Black t-shirts, cut off the sleeves and cut down the sides with a cute lace bandeau bra underneath. Racerback black tank tops and a push up bra does the job. Other than my skinny jeans, sometimes I wear ripped black tights underneath black or denim cutoff shorts. I need a back pocket for my church key. If I happen to wear pants without back pockets, I put it in a black sweat cuff around my forearm.  I never bartend with exposed legs (the skin on your legs will be SO sticky at the end of the night). Don't wear long necklaces or bracelets unless you want it to yank a bottle out of the well by the pour-spout. Sexy is being a good, knowledgeable bartender who is as fast or faster than the guys and doesn't give a shit what she looks like...sweat and a full tip jar is sexy as fuck.   edit: added a link and fixed some typos"

Try finding some at a discount shoe store or Ross, etc.  Aside from that, go for Classy sexy, instead of trashy sexy. Boots, tight pants, long shirt or short dress over, that sort of thing. I agree with another commenter; if you're going to rock the cleavage, don't wear revealing bottoms. If you are wearing shorts or a short skirt, wear a top with more coverage that isn't necessarily form fitting. It Really Will change the way your patrons treat you. They will still hot on you, they will still tip you, but if you class it up justalittlebit most won't push the envelope towards disrespectful.  Another bonus of looking classy sexy; you can wear a messy bun and little makeup and still look good. If you do that in shorts and a tank top you might just look like you didn't feel like trying, (which is fine sometimes too)."

bartenders,3e2mma,creepn1,4,Tue Jul 21 20:57:40 2015 UTC,Its not in his job description to be the judge of that.   Actually it is. The bartender is not there simply to serve; he/she is the authority figure on duty in the bar.

bartenders,3e2mma,redcapmilk,4,Tue Jul 21 15:04:49 2015 UTC,"There's no one standard response, but there is a very important rule that you need to keep in mind. At almost every bar, the bartender is responsible for the atmosphere inside that bar. While 'live and let live' is understandable if the bartender has NO discretion, that approach will hurt the bar in the long run. Bad behavior begets more bad behavior, and attracts others of that type. While it won't happen overnight, if you allow people to sound off like this undeterred, eventually like-minded people are going to flock there and you'll end up bartending the real world equivalent of r/c**ntown. Fuck that and fuck those people."

Change a keg,wash some glasses or try doing a deep clean. If you have time to chat with these people,you have time to do something else."

If you continue to show up on the regular with this behavior you will be 86'd period. And everyone else in the bar will have a much better time. The bartender is there to keep the peace and facilitate the fun for everyone much more so than to 'wash some glasses or do a deep clean.' We are not housekeepers; we are the hosts of a public party involving controlled substances."

As long as you continue to let it happen, there will always be drunk racists in your bar. Walking away is not the right answer. We're trying to build sales and repeat business. Yes, treat your regulars well.. but if they're offending other customers that are would-be regulars, then your racist customers are running off business. Then all you are is a racist little small neighborhood bar that is slowly going to go out of business.   This reflects on you as a bartender. Who do you think your customers look to when they're being mistreated by guests? If they watch you stand idle, then they will assume you're just as racist, or that you've lost control of your bar and neither of which is acceptable. Be a professional, grow a pair, and deal with the racists. Get em' outta there because they will kill the business."

Racism/ignorance is a common topic here. If I'm around and it starts, I leave the area. If it gets worse, I'll tell the guys they're being racist. If they don't like it, tough. I'll suddenly forget their buybacks on their $100 tab if they get that far.   If they don't get the hint then, I'll call them a cab (it's usually the regulars I've driven home before that are the racists) and let them know they're going home early. After the first time, their racism tends to stop the moment they see me.   I don't know if I'm actually teaching them to be more tolerant, but the racism normally occurs 300 yards away from affordable housing where most black, Hispanic, and Guyanese families live.

I personally love making specific cocktails for customers regardless of how busy we are, as long as the customers are polite. If you had a random drink a year ago and forgot what it was called, we can figure that out and create you something similar. If the bartender isn't too busy, have a chat and ask some questions, be friendly and build up a rapport. But judge what you order based on the climate of the bar.

The weeded bartender will also simply drop off what they think is your preferred drink if they are deep in the weeds and don't have time to actually take an order (I've simply had pints handed to me when things are too deep).

You're looking at a somewhat hefty investment if you want to learn a lot.  I recommend grabbing a book for each of these subjects:   Wine (there are so many of these. Pick a recent one as trends change quickly.) Beer (The Complete Beer Course) Distillation (try a book about scotch or bourbon as they often go into the greatest detail.) History of mixed drinks (Punch and Imbibe, both by David Wondrich) A solid recipe book (Savoy Coctail Book) The Drunken Botanist is an award winner, but keep in mind you could get a little confused if you don't know a lot about the spirits it covers.    Other than that, get out and taste everything as you learn. Read bottle labels and check out product reviews. Buy two whiskies and compare them. Infuse your own vodka. Get a case of mixed wines and have a wine & cheese night with your friends. Go to good establishments, sit at the bar and watch the bartenders move."
bartenders,3e1neu,MsRhuby,2,Tue Jul 21 10:39:54 2015 UTC,"Bartender from Australia here. Here's some localised advice for getting a job in the industry.  First things: there's no such thing as ""everything you need to know about alcohol"". No matter how long you've been in the business you still learn new things and improve your skills and technique—or at least you should. But for sure there's ""everything you need to know about alcohol"" for any given venue, so what you need to know right now will depend on the kind of venue you're applying to work at.  The good news: you don't actually need to be a font of knowledge to work in the average Australian bar or pub. (As opposed to the U.S., where even dive bartenders have to have a modicum of cocktail knowledge.) I started out in a high-volume place and I would estimate that 99.9% of the drinks we served there were self-explanatory: most people would come up knowing what they wanted and would order it by name. Once you know how to use a jigger (mandatory in every bar in Australia) and the post-mix gun it's hard to fuck up an order like ""Bundy and Coke"". Similarly for glasses of wine (which will either be called for by varietal or producer) or beers (called for by brand). We only very, very, very rarely made cocktails. A day worth of pour training and the very basics of booze knowledge and you'll be good to go for the average Australian bar. Any bar that would require more in-depth knowledge is either not going to hire anyone without experience or will have an in-house training program that starts you off as a barback or glassie rather than a bartender.  So really, all you need to know before you go handing that resume are the very very basics:   The difference between beer, wine, and spirits. Beer: the difference between lager (the predominant style here), ales, stout, and wheat beer. Wine: the difference between white and red and still and sparkling wines and what each should be served in, plus the characteristics of some of the most commonly ordered varietals of each here in Australia (shiraz, sauvignon blanc, pinot noir, pinot grigio, etc.—don't bother learning about stuff like what goes into a Côtes du Rhône at this stage because Australians nearly always order by varietal rather than region or terroir). Spirits: the differences between what you'll find in the average speed well at an Australian bar—vodka, gin, rum, bourbon, Scotch, tequila, brandy—and what they usually get served with (vodka usually goes with soda, gin with tonic, rum with coke, etc.). Liqueurs: the commonly found brands on the average backbar (Bailey's, Cointreau, Kahlua, Midori, Grand Marnier, etc.) and their primary flavours (cream, orange, coffee, melon …).   Once you know all of this (which isn't a great deal, just the broadest of broad outlines), you should know about as much as the average Australian drinker. Then once you're on the job you can start to fill in the finer details to your heart's content by looking up stuff on YouTube, reading books (I can heartily recommend Morgenthaler's The Bar Book if you want to start with solid technique!) and so on. Anyway, any pub or bar worth its salt is going to start you off doing crap chores like collecting and washing glassware, which will give you plenty of time to learn before you interact with customers. If they throw you straight onto the bar without any training then you should take it as a sign that they have no clue what they're doing or are in dire straits, and bail ASAP.  Hit me up if you have any questions relating specifically to Australia! A lot of the advice on this thread so far is great, but there are a few differences between Australia and the rest of the world when it comes to what bartenders are expected to know and how to get your foot in the industry."

Stroking strangers in thruway rest stops, sometimes 10 or 11 in a day, just to keep myself supplied with the creamy demon. Eventually I couldn't get off by eating or drinking it at all. You promise yourself the first time you smoke it that you'll never spike. Only addicts spike. You're just having fun, could stop anytime. That doesn't last long, those promises are forgotten in semen soaked flophouses, rubber tubing tied to your arm. Waking up dry and desperate... sucking the mattresses. It got bad. Real bad.

Have a stocking shift every day. Someone comes in, makes your syrups, bitters, garnishes, juices, purees. Just a 2-4 hour shift, everybody gets one once a week, no tips but a higher pay. That way all the staff knows and can explain how everything is made. It's not easy to do but it's not impossible."
bartenders,3e0g88,sufjams,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:46:27 2015 UTC,"Sounds good in theory but an owner isn't going to want to pay an extra $$ in labor each week.  They'll just have the bartender on shift do it to save money.  The owners and management don't give a shit if a cocktail has a ""ginger spiced anise simple syrup"".  All they care about is labor hours and sales.  So if you want an insane cocktail list you're going to have to tell the bartenders that their job also includes rigorous prep along with a bar shift; and that's IF the owners or management pop the $ for all the bullshit smoked cardamom you want."

If its fine dining just stay out of the way of the service but even taking orders sometimes doesnt hurt if your barmen are fast enough or can handle the load.  Sometimes get beers or open wine bottles but stay out of the well and never run out of anything.  When its slow they should be preparing for a rush with you and recognizing trends for that day or night.  There is a truism in bartending that is bad barbacks make worse bartenders.  I truly enjoy a good barback and love to teach them things but most shifts I am stuck without one.

There's a barback at my bar who everyone loves, because he does a lot of work, but I hate it when I'm running service well on a Saturday night and grab a beer or glass of wine, only to turn around and see that he already got it without communicating with me. It's a waste of product and of my time.  /rant  But seriously, I'd just go around and ask the bartender what they expect of you. And don't get offended if they're short with you or snap at you during service. We are a salty bunch."
bartenders,3dzn8w,doctajones10,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:13:06 2015 UTC,I had a barback who would budge in front of me and greet the customers. I think he thought he was being outgoing and proactive but it annoyed the shit out of me. They would start ordering from him and i would have to intervene. It really made my job a lot less pleasant and also impacted our tips. Fortunately he only lasted 2 days.  I had another barback who was never around when you needed him---he was always outside chatting with the smokers or in the break room on his phone. It was easier and faster to go change the keg or whatever myself than to find him and make him do it. Then I would get back to my bar to find him making drinks. I hated working with him. I hated it a lot.  Don't be those guys.

bartenders,3dvq20,unusedthought,7,Mon Jul 20 02:48:35 2015 UTC,"I can speak to both sides of the topic. I am a high volume weekend bartender(Fri/Sat night), and I am also a high volume barback(Thursday).  I started out as a bright-eyed barback in a very popular spot in Philadelphia. I busted my ass and gave my all for the team from the very start. I quickly moved up the ladder and acquired the insane Fri/Sat night barback position. Crushed through that opportunity exceptionally well. I was then given some slower bartending shifts. When a high volume weekend bartender moved away, I was offered her shifts.    So now I still have one of my very original barbacking/food running shifts from when I got hired, then the two weekend nights that I earned from hard work.  It was an interesting experience figuring out the balance between the roles during the transition. But now.... I'm a very fucking handy asset to have on hand, I can dive into any problem my team can get into and get us out on top. (I also am trusted to wear the manager hat when needed.)  As a barback: (These are things I do and I expect out of my barbacking peers)  Im a ghost.  I hear everything, and I try to anticipate everything. I have 3 different speeds, and I know when I need to shift between them: normal, fast, and expert.  I can make a priority list, and be able to modify it on the fly. Shit happens, things break, kegs kick, fights break out and pick pockets show up. I make the most out of every trip, my hands are full all the fucking time. Next level multi-tasking.  I understand the flow of my shifts, I plan ahead, I have the walk-in kegs stacked to perfection, down to what kegs are about to kick and have them out of the way for the next set that will be tapped. I can be in and out with empty keg in hand in less than 15 seconds. Speed racer bro.    The chick I barback for is my bartending mentor, an older sister of sorts. We are battle hardened from countless insane weekends together. We can handle any level of stress thats handed to us. I keep backing her up until she taps me in, then step out when I'm no longer needed.    Being a bartender, these are the things I've modified in my barbacking to be more helpful.  I try to keep the colder glassware in reach, and the hot ones from the washer behind.  If you aren't at your station, I'll give you a quick tidy up, clean your tins, wipe it down, dump your rail mats. I am very fond of the phrase ""the bartender will be right with you"" and go about my business of getting all the shit done.  What I expect out of my bartenders I work under.  BRING YOUR A+++ GAME, I brought mine, make us money.   (Though I respect and understand the odd off days, and I will try to help accordingly to get us through it)  If you have a bad experience with a customer, don't take it out on me.  Please don't be above helping me if I'm in the weeds and you are sitting around doing nothing.  Now being a bartender and knowing what the role of high volume barbacking for 3 tenders feels like: I will give you a 2min warning on when I need ice, beer, or any other supply before I get critically low.  I'll try to let you know if something is a priority or a get it done in the next 2 hours kind of thing.  I'll give you a heads up if the current trend of the night is Red Stripe and bring up an extra couple packs.  Admit mistakes. Work as a cohesive team. Work as fast as possible, and come out on top with a ton of cash and battle wounds.   Sorry this got long. I got carried away with pressing letters because I enjoy my job.  **edit: I also clean when I am bored. Aka, I'm never bored."

As a bartender, there are the basics of each individual bar the barback should know to do. There are other things that they may be asked to do because of the need for the bartender to stay behind the bar. As a barback, I just wanted my bartenders to be fair. There would be times where I would be running up and down 3 floors for 8+ hours, and they'd expect something instantly. They would get particularly chippy when they started drinking, and that would piss me off. I'd be working my ass off, and they'd be wanting me to do everything while they were too busy getting drunk."

bartenders,3dvq20,flashisflamable,2,Sun Jul 19 23:39:05 2015 UTC,"Have common sense, be pro-active, and know how to prioritise.  This one guy I was training up at my previous venue was the kind of person where you only had to tell him how to do something once and you'd never have to remind him to do it again."
bartenders,3dvq20,SamChronicles,2,Mon Jul 20 00:39:26 2015 UTC,I bar backed for around three and a half years before bartending. What I look for in a bar back is something simple. Pride. It's what I had and its what the guys who trained me had. It's hard to find. I want my barback to look at the bar like a master piece. Not worry about his friends at the end of the bar and pour them drinks.
bartenders,3dvq20,Timonaut,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:12:17 2015 UTC,I've never thought about it that way. I am a barback transitioning into a bartender in about a month or two. It will be my job to train up the next barback that takes my spot. Thank you for that comment.

bartenders,3dvq20,d_bones,4,Mon Jul 20 03:32:27 2015 UTC,"Never worked in a bar with bar backs.   My first bar was a tavern, where you sent your glasses to the kitchen to be washed and people rarely ordered anything but beer. Really, most nights we didnt even bother filling ice buckets.  Next bar was a cocktail joint, just a small booth in a hotel where guests could grab a few before dinner or shoot some billiards. We cut fruit as we needed it and washed our own glasses.  Past 2 bars have been restaurant/pub/club combos. Multiple bartenders on staff, everyone takes shifts doing everything. If something like ice, glasses, or fruit runs down you grab it yourself.  I honestly dont get the concept of ""barbacking"" or how hardcore most of this sub can get. The job comes with other work besides mixing drinks, why hire someone to work below you and do it when you're a fully capable human being? If theres someone behind my bar who cant do my job as well then theyre taking up space."
bartenders,3dvq20,kylesbagels,23,Sun Jul 19 23:36:22 2015 UTC,If you don't understand why barbacks are needed then you've never worked at a busy bar.
bartenders,3dvq20,smokeygaston,2,Mon Jul 20 00:16:52 2015 UTC,Because it doesnt make sense for a bar have ample bartending staff so that one can dip and grab some more ice. I'd love for you to elaborate on the benefits of barbacking instead of telling me that my venues aren't busy enough.
bartenders,3dvq20,kylesbagels,10,Mon Jul 20 04:36:04 2015 UTC,"You and the bar make money by serving drinks. Every minute you, as a bartender, spend not making drinks is a minute you and the bar aren't making money.   If a bartender has enough time between customers to stock glass, ice and alcohol then you're bar isn't busy enough to need a barback.   If your bar is slammed pack but you don't have a barback and so you or another bartender has to stop serving in order to stock glass etc. then your quality of service and tips are hurting because of it.   And if for some reason you work at a busy and having a bartender quit serving to stock etc DOESN'T affect your quality of service then that means you have 1 too many bartenders and they should be made a barback which will help your tips because you're splitting the tips one way less."
bartenders,3dvq20,smokeygaston,5,Mon Jul 20 04:52:46 2015 UTC,"Ah! Theres the reason for confusion.  Im in New Zealand, there are tips but very few. We were slammed 11-4 on Saturday night and I took home $25, plus $15 hourly.   It doesnt make sense to not just overstaff by one bartender because a barback would be paid the same rate as a bartender but theyd be limited in what they can do."

We also have a new washing machine for glasses that backs up in the kitchen. Also, the kitchen cleared out the ice machine.  It was only an hour before another back back came in to back me up and I spent 4.5 hours running at top speed washing and stocking glasses, prepping garnishes as they ran out, bringing 13 gallons of ice at a time up from the basement, etc.   Then I sat down for 15 minutes and me and the other guy took turns being the behind the bar guy and the guy running around for the next 4 hours.   Three bartenders all night, fwiw."

bartenders,3dvq20,radmarshallb,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:35:23 2015 UTC,"I understand this to an extent. We have a busser position, and they basically float and do anything that needs to be done. They run food, stock the bar with ice and beer, clean up broken dishes, bus tables, etc. But we all do those things too. If I don't see that guy immediately when a keg dies, I'll change it myself. Servers will bus their own tables. The busser doesn't sit behind the bar but they make sure all the other staff has what they need and it runs really well.  We did 20 grand on Friday last weekend with 5 bartenders, 3 servers, and 1 busser so I don't buy the 'not busy enough' argument."
bartenders,3dvq20,kylesbagels,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:21:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as far as I understand the bar back is just someone who isn't a bartender who hangs behind the bar.

bartenders,3dvq20,radmarshallb,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:37:48 2015 UTC,"I had a position as an actual barback for a while and I often felt in the way behind the bar. I made sure the bar had everything they needed, but I got out as soon as they were clear. I spent the rest of my time making sure the servers were as efficient as they could be. Running food, cleaning ash trays, bussing their tables, so on and so forth. And they tipped me out for it. I think that arrangement works well."
bartenders,3dvq20,kylesbagels,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:52:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, at my bar if a server is behind the bar its because they bartend when food service is done. If you dont bartend you dont go back there."

As a bar back, bust ass and don't be afraid to take drink orders if it's slamming. Great way to learn and HOPEFULLY bartenders will recognize and compensate accordingly. Two of our current bar backs were super wet behind the ears when they started but now they know a few drinks, have picked up some slower bar shifts, and can be a bartender in a pinch if we're slammed. House norm is 10% for bar backs, but we always round up to nearest $50 and include extra if necessary based on performance."

A good bartender is always aware of his stock and doesn't send you to get something and have you run to get something else immediately when you get back. Also, your arms aren't broken. You're not too good to fill your own ice when it's slow.   A good barback is someone who can observe and not wait to be told what to do. Someone who take initiative and listens to the vibe.

bartenders,3duvrh,george_glass4,2,Mon Jul 20 08:12:03 2015 UTC,"Here's some things I've found, hopefully this is a good starting point. I'm not going to give you all my secrets but this should help you explore a bit:  1) Sherry  Sherry is both a good supporting ingredient and also works great as a ""canvas"". For example, as a support, use it as a substitute for secondary ingredients, like instead of Vodka in a Vesper, or Chartreuse in a Last Word. It brings a really unique nutty, bright pop to cocktails. Experiment with different kinds of sherry to see what works where, Fino sherry is the most versatile in my experience. Also what I mean as a canvas is sherry takes on flavors really well. I've infused it with things like honeydew, habaneros, prickly pears and rhubarb with great results to name a few flavors.  2) Port  The only time I really use port in drinks is in place of sweet vermouth. Haven't had enough exposure and practice with it otherwise. I feel like it would make a good float, or perhaps using it in place of bitters might give some interesting results.  Also, if you have access to Ice Wine, you can use it as your sweet component in cocktails. I personally can't stand Ice Wine on it's own, but I love using it in drinks that call for lemon, especially sours.  As for Amaros, I try to make my own. I don't know if this technically counts as an Amaro or a Vermouth or whatever, but if you have old spoiled wine sitting around, you can flavor it by simmering herbs, spices, fruits and whatever you have lying around, then sweeten it and fortify it.

After a few months of dealing with one manager who had never worked in a bar, didn't know his ass from his elbow and was so incompetent it took him a WEEK to put out a schedule and another manager who was either taking a ""smoke break"" aka going to the bar around the corner or ripping shots in the camera blind spots (it's illegal for bartenders to drink where I'm from) we had a full on mutiny last weekend. I can't recommend that as most of us are still unemployed but I would suggest bitching up as much as you can. Go to the GM with all of your complaints/suggestions and volunteer to execute these changes. Hopefully he'll realize the manager is a waste of space. Good luck!"

Now that I'm a little older, I still have no interest in drinking, but I LOVE making and serving drinks.  Go figure.  As other people have rightly said, a big part of bartending is giving advice or recommendations, so I make a point of ""straw-tasting"" a drink the first few times I've made it. Wherever possible, I've asked a more experienced bartender to taste it as well - if not, I ask them when I see them how one should taste.  As for customers asking what I drink, I usually just tell them my favourite is whichever cocktail I need to practice at the time. That way if they do have it, I get to practice the drink."

Part of the job is being able to describe how things taste, and make recommendations to your guests according to their tastes. Having a couple of defaults is a super lazy and ineffective bar tending method. If you don't drink, you have to depend on your coworkers' opinions, or stuff that you read online or whatever to make sure your guest gets something they will like, whether it's an ipa, a riesling, or a neat cask proof bourbon. Fucking Moscow mule or mojito? If those are your go-tos, I pity your guests. Get to know them and their tastes, and the product that you're selling, and make recommendations accordingly. If you don't drink, you are at a disadvantage and need to learn how to relay information very effectively. Edit: also, there is no mint in a Moscow mule."

bartenders,3ds8c1,vieve3,4,Sun Jul 19 11:15:42 2015 UTC,"Didn't mean to offend, but this sort of illustrates my point. If you don't like gin, you just shouldn't order a Negroni, rather than ordering a Negroni with vodka instead of gin.  Moreover, if you think you don't like gin, you shouldn't be ordering any drink where gin is the star attraction, but there are plenty of cocktails where gin is used to add depth and complexity, but is tempered by the other ingredients.   Corpse Reviver #2, The Last Word, Gimlets, etc. are all gin based, but there's enough other flavors going on that the gin isn't dominating the show. Those drinks need the gin's complexity, though - they simply wouldn't be as good if you substituted vodka."

Thing is, places like this have a high staff turnover - a lot of those other workers were only there for a few months. Two years later, some days I wake up feeling like I'm underwater - can't hear a thing.  .  HAVE FUN ON YOUR BAR. Seriously. If you're having a laugh and enjoying yourself, people will 1) pick up on that and take it back to their friends, meaning your attitude can genuinely change the atmosphere in the club. 2) it means that when it inevitably gets busy, they won't mind the wait because you're being friendly and personable.  .  Don't be afraid to work in a small team. The club has four bars and a VIP room. Most of the bars have at least four staff on them on a busy night. The bar I ran (management now so it's not ""my"" bar any more) was on the dancefloor. Some busy nights we just asked the bosses to put me and my right-hand man on there. Space was limited and we worked well together - we were faster without someone getting in our way. I'm not saying you should have less staff on busy nights at all, just saying that if you have a way to do things that goes against the grain but it works, do it.  .  Be nice to the DJ. He entertains you all night. Be nice to the doorstaff. They keep everyone safe all night. Be nice to the floor staff/bar backs/glass collectors. Without them, you're not making any drinks. Be nice to your bosses, and they should be nice to you.  .  Clubs are a weird place to work, even in the bar trade. Often you all work the exact same shift patterns so you can become a real family. Staff at the club have our own hashtag that we use on Instagram (not telling, sorry!). Point is, these people are your colleagues, but they're your friends and family too.

bartenders,3dowew,hanneken,17,Sat Jul 18 01:25:14 2015 UTC,I once watched my coworker put ice in a martini glass to chill it and leave it on the service well while she turned around to stir her gin and while she wasn't looking a server ran the martini glass full of ice to the table.   The look on her face when she turned around to strain it off into the glass was fucking priceless.

If you have a brandy snifter you can lay it on its side and it will hold exactly 1 1/12 ounces. (In case you didn't get it 4 is 1/2 an ounce 8 is 1 ounce.) Remember the recipes of drinks your place has... possibly go to a similar or another location of the restaurant and ask the bartender's what people normally drink. Don't freak out. You can do it.

bartenders,3do2n5,NYGateKeeper,4,Sat Jul 18 18:06:56 2015 UTC,"I have an estimate of 140-160 for my IQ based on several tests I've taken during my childhood, adolescence, and college years. This plus ADD (inattentive).  The worst two jobs I've ever had are clerical work and running a cash register. There is no original thought- records are always filed alphabetically, and sandwiches are always rung up the same way.   I have been in the service industry for almost 8 years now, and have done most non-managerial positions. I'm not a good deputy, but I'm a damn good leader or posse member. Authority problem? Nah, but I hate middle management something fierce.   I truly love bartending and waiting tables. My greatest joys in life are making people happy, eating and drinking tasty things, creative expression, and problem solving. I'm really good at keeping calm under pressure- in fact, I'd say I thrive under it. When it's a slow day, I get wrapped up in my head and make foolish mistakes.   The basic processes of service jobs are simple on paper- greet, take order, deliver order, deliver check. Ensure satisfaction. The difference between a great server and a servtron unit is what happens in between the necessary steps, and the finesse with which the tasks are performed. Finesse takes practice, but I am great at learning from mistakes and not making them again.   I don't have a cog mentality, and am not interested in any sort of corporate culture. Right now I see myself in the latter stage of information gathering and skill building before I start my own restaurant and bar. Learning never stops, though- it's not like I'm going to open up shop and then just keep doing things the same forever. I'm going to learn on my feet with the skills and experience I have, and hire intelligent people who can not only understand my ideas but improve them. Idealistic, sure, but I have had no problem in life achieving my goals.   I can't imagine working in any other field."
bartenders,3do2n5,cybrcat21,3,Sat Jul 18 04:47:25 2015 UTC,"I have a degree in neuroscience and a background in research.  I got a job sweeping up cigarettes on a smoking patio of a hipster dive bar to pay the bills while I went to school.  I liked working in bars way more than I liked academia, so I basically threw my degree in the trash and just kind of kept working in bars.  I like talking shit and making drinks and getting home at 4am and waking up whenever I want.  I like that while everyone is out spending their money on a Friday or Saturday night, I'm making mine.  I like going out on a Tuesday to an empty bar where I don't have to wait for a drink and I know the staff because we all party together.  I like the blue collar aspect of work, where I get home after working my ass off for 12 hours hating everything and everyone and being too tired to even shower.  I like not having to wear a suit, I like being in the middle of a rush and having to juggle thirty different priorities at once.  I like geeking out about alcohol and prohibition era cocktails and homemade ingredients and the immediate satisfaction that comes from giving someone a great drink and having their face light up.  I like the constant struggle for improvement, and that there's never a shift where everything goes 100 percent perfectly but I can try to hit that goal the next night.  I like training new kids, I like the challenge of inspiring and motivating a staff of 40 bartenders. I like figuring out how to get more people through the door, or how to structure our next menu, or how to get labor where it needs to be.  I like being in meetings with all the huge personalities from corporate, and seeing the game of thrones style politicking that goes on behind the scenes of a massive 4,000pax nightclub.  So yeah, I'm not going back to the academic life.  This one's way more fun."

However, my coked up, drunk manager who is the other bartender (no barback) on Wednesdays, took it upon herself to, ""make 10 boneless wings"" (normally a 5 minute job, tops) for 30 minutes while I was 6 deep. Ended up doing okay, but boy did I have to tell many middle aged former yuppies from NYC and the Hamptons that this is an Irish pub, not Williamsburg. When the manager returned, she was high as all hell and watched me make dozens of drinks while she adjusted the credit card tips while we were still jam-packed.

Talk to the owner/manager tell them you're interested in a bartending position (I help manage a few small neighborhood bars and experience is a plus but definatley not neccessary. We prefer to train people ""our way"") volunteer for the slow shifts to train and get experience. While talking to them and you have their attention try to showcase your customer service experience (ie be out going, smile, ask them how their day is going etc) don't jump right in asking for a job, show them that you're personable.  If they offer you just a Barback position take it, learn from it and try to go above and beyond what's needed.  Take advantage of opportunities if you are a barback, if it's slow ask the bartender to show you a few things (if it's slow they're usually willing to show you stuff to not be bored or for god sakes have to clean haha).

My best advice: prove yourself in everything you do, attention to detail and my own mantra when getting my ass kicked ""slow is smooth and smooth is fast""  what I mean by that saying is you just have to slow it all down in your head.  Dont get jittery, dont get flustered, just hold your line and keep your head above the fray"

bartenders,3diyl9,StoleYourTv,5,Thu Jul 16 17:26:38 2015 UTC,"Bar supervisor with social anxiety here.   Bartending was the last FOH job I hadn't done so I wanted to try my hand at it. It was very difficult to get over my shyness, and it is still difficult dealing with the anxiety, but bartending has helped a lot with that.  If you're shy, force yourself to say something to every guest (when you're not busy) aside from taking their drink order. I usually comment on their drink--i.e. ""awesome choice, I actually like it best when it's made X way""--or maybe on something they are wearing if it's a lady (I'm female so this isn't weird). If all else fails, ask them what they're doing in this part of the city/neighborhood. Ask them more questions building off their answer; people love to talk about themselves.   Then there's anxiety about confrontation. I used to be so nervous cutting people off that I would stutter while talking to them, and that made it hard for them to take me seriously. So I came up with a couple of lines that I recycle when I have to cut someone off, and for other difficult situations too. Basically, it took a lot of experiences to get over my fear of confrontation. A lot of guests taking advantage of me, treating me as a doormat, etc., before I realized that timidity is not the best quality to have as a bartender.   Am I a social butterfly now? Absolutely not. While my anxiety has improved tenfold from when I first started, it's still there. After work, I'm mentally exhausted and usually keep to myself.   Anyway, hope some of this helped you!"

bartenders,3diyl9,bromanski,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:35:10 2015 UTC,"When I first started out I did the same thing, making sure to talk to every guest at least a little bit (and obviously I wasn't scheduled for very busy shifts). The thing that amazed me was how, almost every time, people seemed relieved to talk, even when initially I got the impression that they just wanted to enjoy their drink in peace.  I think a lot of times customers experience social anxiety too, and despite how entirely normal it is to go to a bar by oneself, I think a lot of folks are self-conscious about it. You are there to feel it out, and cater to them accordingly."

bartenders,3diyl9,beollWARRIOR86,2,Sat Jul 18 17:36:51 2015 UTC,I used to be the one of the most shy people you'd of ever met. When I started working in restaurants when I was 18 I was still super shy. I'm not sure how but I've come out of my shell a ton in the 7.5 years since and it feels great. As to why I became a bartender? I've got no prior serving  experience so I decided to see if they'd let me try the bar route. I'm loving it and couldn't be happier to not be a server.
bartenders,3diyl9,Deviant502,2,Thu Jul 16 18:36:37 2015 UTC,"I used to be very shy, quite reserved. Thing that helps me the most now to initiate a conversation is to compliment jewelry.

bartenders,3diyl9,drunkentuckian,2,Thu Jul 16 19:49:40 2015 UTC,"I've always been kinda socially uncomfortable. I started out barbacking and I guess they either liked my hustle or thought I looked okay behind the bar. I didn't really have a say in the matter. I just went to pick up my paycheck one day and the boss said he wanted me to be the next bartender. The kitchen hated me for it. They all wanted that spot.  That was 9 years ago. I'm still awkward as fuck, but I get a certain confidence boost behind the bar. I've tried serving shifts at the bar I work at now and am terrible at it. I feel so out of place. At least behind the bar if I run out of conversation I can grab a glass and start polishing, or open the ice bin or beer cooler and look at it like I'm checking out something important."
bartenders,3diyl9,errycupid,2,Thu Jul 16 23:07:46 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely an introvert, and it's probably fair to say that I suffer at least mild social anxiety. I don't have to worry about panic attacks or anything, but I'm way easier to shake up in interacting with other people than seems to be the norm.  For me, I fell into the job after college, when I moved back home and found out one of my parents had tanked the family's finances. I needed to tackle my student loan debt fast, and I'd gotten into cocktails/the bar scene a little in college, so I thought, ""Fuck, I could do this for a year or so, why not?"" I didn't really think about how socially demanding the position was at the time, though the reality started to sink in when my first few interviews basically went like ""HUH YOU SEEM KIND OF NERVOUS, WE'LL HAVE TO GIVE YOU A CALL...""  When I finally got put on somewhere, though, it was pretty much sink or swim, and I just adapted. Am I ever going to be the wild, endlessly fun, makes-you-want-to-do-thirty-shots-with-him-and-take-him-home kind of bartender? Probably not. But I'll make up for it by being polite as fuck, endlessly patient, and willing to listen to whatever guests feel like chatting about. It's an ongoing process, and it can be draining sometime - especially since co-workers, more than guests, even, will get on your case about this shit - but I feel like I keep improving.  And, really, that's part of why I decided I wanted to keep doing this as the start of a career: Suddenly, I was putting myself out there every day, interacting with people constantly, and feeling like I'd made their nights a little better. After spending four years pretty much holed up in a library forgetting what other people looked like, that was a godsend. Bartending's made me confront and deal with my social anxiety directly in a way nothing else ever did before, and I'm thankful for having stumbled into it."
bartenders,3diyl9,riverwestmke,2,Fri Jul 17 04:36:06 2015 UTC,"As an introvert with a fair share of social anxiety, I love bartending because I'm able to  put on my fun joking face which otherwise probably wouldn't see the light of day."

bartenders,3dh266,heckmanshoppers,60,Thu Jul 16 05:26:26 2015 UTC,"Another way I like to think of situations like these is to liken the person to a monkey.

bartenders,3d7ma9,fiaafox,7,Tue Jul 14 03:37:55 2015 UTC,"I can't say I've ever heard of needing a knee brace for a lack of bar mat.  I was under the assumption they were there for slip prevention with a side benefit of more cusion.   I will definitly HIGHLY reccomend you spend money on your feet though. (I'm also sort of curious as to what footwear your collegue is wearing that needs a knee brace)  When I started working in the bar industry 4 years ago as a barback, I was blowing through sneakers every 3-6 months depending on brand. Waking up in the morning with severe foot/calf/hip pain, would hobble around for a better part of an hour until my body loosened up. Then I started spending money on my feet. I first bought myself hiking shoes (not boots), insoles and performance socks.   They are able to handle the wear A LOT better, I am now hitting 10+ months before I blow out the sole. The hiking shoes I have been buying are also waterproof, so now my feet are also dry after an intense weekend night in a club setting where behind the bar looks like a swamp. (as they age, the waterproofing starts to fail). These Northface Hedgehogs were my first pair I tried, they lasted roughly around a year. I was very happy with the durability, comfort and waterproofing on this shoe. I got these Merrells to replace the Northfaces. The durability is really good, I am at 11 months now going strong with little signs of wear.  They are grimy as fuck, and the waterproofing is getting pretty lazy. So they win in my book for holding up to a beating, but not as comfortable as the Northfaces.  I did a lot of research on insoles and tried out a bunch, ranging from the Dr. Sholls (absolute shit for proper support IMO) to heat moldable soles, then finally to my favorite insole that I would recommend to any person that has at least one foot. Superfeet.  The colors vary for arch height, as well as what type of shoe you will be placing them in. The green work great for me. I saw a review that said the blue worked great for low arches and orange was for boots.   A word of warning on the Superfeet, these are not like walking on a cloud, don't expect that shit, expect some firm ass proper support for your feet. I no longer wake up and hobble around like an 80year old lady without her walker.  Socks, not as important as the previous two. But after experiencing the fit and dryness of great socks, I will never go back. EVER.  These are all I wear now, Thirty48  Hope this helps. Feel free to ask any other questions you may have."

Move the benches/tables out and get classic couch cubes (have no idea what they are called in English, but the ones you see in all the shows, HIMYM and so on).  And unless the bar is packed all the time I would also get ~3 bar-chairs in.  You might already be changing all of this, but that was just my 2c, change the seating and fill up the room some more."

You'll occasionally get the ""trying to hard"" kid who asks for a Manhattan or an Old Fashioned but to be honest you'll be slinging beers and vodka-crans all night. If someone asks you for something strong just make them a double of something simple, they'll still love you for it.  Also do your absolute best to AVOID JAGER AT ALL COSTS. That shit is sticky as hell... ugh."

If you're unable to ask another bartender what's in a drink, ask the customer. They're going to look at you like you have two heads. If they don't know what's in it, they shouldn't be drinking it.   Conversely another option for the inexperienced college bartender is ""make it the color it sounds"". I've been bartending 2 college bars for 7 years now and no one has ever called me out on this."

Works perfectly for a mule. Also, I like to use gin instead of vodka in my mules. Just my own preference though.   Adding a minor mix of Lemonade along with sour eases the tartness in margaritas. Don't forget to line your glass with the line you either squeeze in or garnish with.   I made up a grapefruit ""substitute"" out of necessity and this girl ended up buying all the time instead of a standard greyhound after we got a new supply of juice in. Sour, Lemonade, and grenadine. Little more sour than Lemonade and a splash of grenadine for the color.   And one of my favorites to try out on people who are feeling adventurous: 1 pint glass a quarter full of ice, fill 3/4 hefeweizen, 1 shot of vodka, .5 shot orange liqueur of your choice, top off with more ice if needed. No orange needed and it has an added kick.   Also, if your cherry juice hasn't been contaminated with your fingers or whatnot, use that instead of grenadine.

We've got an Instagram and a Facebook page, but management doesn't pay enough attention to either.  The bars I've known with successful social media promotion have made sure to post witty, informative Facebook, Instagram and Twitter posts daily. Something that lets your clientele know about the day's specials, entertainment, etc. in a concise manner, accompanied by a quip about something topical or some kind of clever in-joke.  Just as important, if not more so, is social media promotion by individual bartenders. Most tenders worth their salt are social people with a large network, comprised of both personal friends and a circle of regulars from their current and previous jobs. A number of bartenders I know have separate, professional Facebook pages and Twitter handles strictly used to shout out to their social circles on the nights they're working."

Some bars tend to do nothing more than advertise, but I feel like there needs to be some amount of wit to it.  If I'm just a normal patron I need a good reason to have their posts clogging up my feed.  Specials and programs are good, as are announcements of live music or whatever.  At the same time, I like to see something that entertains me once in a while.  If you're not going to update daily (or at the very least weekly) don't bother.  It just appears half-assed at that point.

bartenders,3cq9ls,medschoolbaddie,5,Thu Jul 9 22:23:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think that management of a strip club could even wrap their heads around a girl wanting to barback.  These folks aren't the most socially progressive. Barbacking is a guy's job. Women belongs on stage or behind the bar.  I don't think you need to ""work your way up"". Strip club bartending is as simple as it gets and you could probably be trained in less than an hour. You open a couple a beer, serve a couple of highballs... people don't go there to drink, you won't be rushed.  But... honnestly, how do you look on a scale of 10? Looks are pretty crucial for women who want to bartend (though it is slowly changing, especially in cocktail bars and restaurants). It's pretty much necessary to be pretty hot to bartend at a strip club.  I'm from Montreal, which is a city famous for its strip clubs and the girls who work them. I've worked the big nightclubs of St-Laurent street in the past and thus have met a couple of girls that used to work service in strip clubs or who went on to after. They were all bombshells. Not my type at all, way to bimboish ... but definitely smoking hot.  Maybe the strip club market is very different where you live, but this is how it is in Montreal.  [Edit : read your post again. You worked in clubs so you're probably very aware of the part about looks...]"

But it's fine, they're not my type of girls.  I did hook up with 1 barmaid and 2 waitresses while I was working there and another one did tell me that we would have fucked had she been single (not that I asked her to...); but it's true that the vast majority of the girls in there did not find my attractive in the slightest. Hell, I came to work to that club on a bicycle with a fucking basket in front. Some of the barmaids were driving beamers.  I have charm and a certain way with girls (or used to... married with 2 kids now), but you do have to get to know me and I didn't get to know too many of these girls."
bartenders,3cq9ls,mambouli,2,Sun Jul 12 04:53:20 2015 UTC,"I was a barback at a gentlemen's club for a long time, though I'm a man. My interview was completely normal. I would imagine for a woman it's inherently different because even though you're bartending, the clientele views you as a performer, just like the strippers - except you're not naked. The owners and floor managers know this. This means (in my experience) what they want is someone who's gonna take a lot of shit from sleazy guys. Knowing your shit is less important than that. Have thick skin while also being able to smile and flirt and wink. Also don't be addicted to heroin.   Good luck!"
bartenders,3cq9ls,omgidontcare,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:35:04 2015 UTC,"Just outta curiosity, I've heard stories about people who have heard about interviewing at gentleman's clubs. Two in particular claimed they had one of the strippers walk in topless for some reason, more or less a test to see if you don't get distracted too easily. I think they're ribbing me on this but idk. Did that happen in your case?"
bartenders,3cq9ls,ajgon23,2,Fri Jul 10 03:28:55 2015 UTC,"Didn't happen to me during the actual interview, though that was probably due to the layout of this particular club. But I certainly saw topless women in every corner when I entered and on my way up to the office (which took me past the ""champagne rooms"" and everything). I doubt they orchestrate a distraction-test for every interview. The guys who run these places typically see too much money, too much employee turnover, and too many breasts to give a shit. If a stripper walks in it's likely because she's got shit to do.   Though it probably doesn't hurt to appear unfazed no matter what."
bartenders,3cq9ls,omgidontcare,2,Fri Jul 10 04:50:16 2015 UTC,"Like several others have said here, I don't think applying for a barback job at a strip joint is your best path to a bartending gig. I barbacked at my bar for 6 months before I started tending, and I firmly believe in doing things the right way and working your way up, but I honestly don't think that approach will work in your situation.  I'm an unabashed feminist, so it pains me to say this, but it's incredibly likely that you'll be laughed out of a barback interview at a strip club. The hiring manager is probably looking for a large, intimidating guy who can lift full kegs, provide backup for door security, and who won't engage with the customers too much. There's little upward mobility for strip club barbacks, as many of the bartenders tend to be older dancers who are a bit past their physical prime but still attractive and personable enough to make money behind the bar. The rest are usually young, attractive girls who, much like cocktail waitresses, want to leverage their appearance and personalities to make good tips while not going as far as dancing on a stage and giving lapdances.  Again, like others have said, strip club bartending is EASY, at least from a knowledge standpoint. In my opinion, your best bet for getting a foot in the door as a bartender is to brush up on simple cocktail recipes, buy a speed pourer and jigger and practice your pours with water at home, and to read this subreddit religiously to pick up on jargon and the nuances of the job. Once you feel like you could pass as a bartender, bullshit your applications and say you've got a year of experience. You've worked as a cocktail waitress, so I think I can safely assume you're attractive and personable. The rest will come with experience.  Best of luck to you!"
bartenders,3cq9ls,ElcidBarrett,2,Fri Jul 10 08:22:35 2015 UTC,I've worked as clubs-- barbacks double as security. The only woman I've seen working the  position was smoking hot AND could dead lift 300lb.   Apply for waitressing- generally how women get into bartending at the rippers.

bartenders,3cq9ls,fearlo,2,Thu Jul 9 23:46:58 2015 UTC,"As someone who started out bartending at sleazy gentlemen's clubs--They will care way more about your appearance and your ability to talk/flirt with men (and get them to spend) than your bar experience.  It's a lot different process than hiring for a regular bar or an upscale strip club.  They probably have a high turnover; I would just be sure to let them know that you are reliable, friendly, competent and a saleswoman.  Be sure to ask about dress code.  If they do drink commission.  How payout works, etc.    Most of the adult clubs I worked at (and eventually managed at) didn't mind having to train a new girl if she was up to physical requirements.  it's definitely a different world."

The only thing I've noticed is that the hardcore reformed alcoholic ones don't like dealing with drunk people so avoid shifts Friday and Saturday nights, and drinking holidays, and make less money because of that. The ones that just don't drink because they're sportsters or drugstores seem to have no problem with that.  I think the only drawback is they don't make very good cocktails, but if I recall correctly, they didn't make good cocktails when they were drinking either."

There's a ton of factors in that, though.   I only ever have one bartender, one barback we share with the main bars,  with some cocktail servers, and then myself as a floater since I'm generally ""running"" the thing. The gratuity is broken down between us by hours and rank.  Leads get the best hours and best rank rate on these as we have to be there first and we're last to leave.  My bartender gets the next best hours, and is ranked even with the cocktailers.   Open bar and tickets we generally do better on since every cash tip left by a guest is ""additional"". My best guy can generally lock down an extra 150-200$ for the pot.  Cash bars aren't nearly as great.   I would get familiar with your places ""banquet policies"".  Are your spaces a food and beverage minimum (which are awesome!) or just a rental fee? Some places have a combination of both. And if it's a food and beverage minimum, what are they for the space and do they change based on days of the week or holiday seasons? The better knowledge you have of that, the better you'll know what kind of money you're walking into on any given party.   Most places I've done this banquet stuff on, I've walked out that night with cash in hand. The place I'm at now mostly does cash night of, but during holiday season we'll move to cash the next day, simply because they want a second set of eyes going over the division when there's so much every day."

bartenders,3cdg8e,babylina,3,Tue Jul 7 05:19:57 2015 UTC,"in the process of switching from IT to barbacking then to bartending.  what i've learned:  get any local food service permit/certification.  get your local TIPS or ServSafe for alcohol.  since your selling point is going to be your brain, start actively studying.  Mr. Boston is a tiny book of a ton of standard cocktails.  DeGroff's craft of the cocktail is one of the greats' guides.  Regan's joy of mixology has a neat classification system that might help you keep more stuff in your head.  i just started reading the drunken botanist, and it's an easy read and has tons of information on the history of booze and how it's made.  i took a brief bar course.  i learned a few things and gained some confidence, but watch this video instead and buy a $15 bar kit, and practice free pouring and counting to 4 to measure an ounce.  get a waiter's friend.  then throw some parties with the money you saved on a bar course.  maybe have it be a potluck, and you provide the booze.  pick two cocktails and get everything you need to make them right.  maybe a cosmopolitans and old fashioneds night.  then make the cocktails while everyone is looking at you, and don't nervously narrate what you're doing.  open a few bottles of wine.  make a resume that fits on one page.  nobody gives a shit about your experience at your last job except for how it relates to you being a good worker and being valued.  if you make a lot of money at it, list your salary.  i put a summary statement.  yours might be ""accomplished computer science professional looking to transition into hospitality and bartending seeking a weekend position as a barback""  then put bullets of what they might give a shit about:  a second language, those food handling certifications you got, if you run triathlons.  are you a fast learner? why not make that a bullet?  studying cocktails?  bullet.  get a haircut, shave, cut your nails. dress in a pressed black button down shirt (sleeves rolled up neatly works), black slacks, and black shoes.  try to look good.  print 30 resumes, and go to bars and restaurants before or in between rushes.  say ""hey, i'm looking for work as a barback. do you know if you guys are hiring, or is there someone here i could talk to?""  worst case, they'll take your resume.  ask them if they can recommend any other places or if they have any advice.  thank them and get their name.  notate in your phone date, time, bar name, who you talked to, what they said basically.  go to the places they recommended, and add ""i spoke with stevemantha at other bar and they said this might be a good place to ask.""  observe people looking at your resume, and pay attention to the questions they ask you.  use that and any advice you get when you specifically request advice, and update your skillset and resume.  also, and i'm not kidding, if you're cute and comfortable with it, apply in gay bars.  i've handed out about 100 resumes in person and sent out about the same on craigslist.  i got hired at a place i think was just hiring me to put pressure on their other guy to pick up shifts, so i lost my job after a week.  then i walked into a gay bar, asked the bartender where he would recommend, he told me a place on the other side of town.  i went there, and they told me they were having an open call the next day.  i walked around the area a little bit, but didn't go into one place because i thought they wouldn't hire me.  i came back the next day, and filled out a tediously long corporate application.  went outside and walked past a lady, asked her if they were hiring.  she said no.  i asked for advice, and she pointed across the street at the place i'd avoided.  i went in, almost walked out halfway through the seriously long corporate application, and got hired that day.  EDIT: as other people suggested, you could to the event bartender stuff as well, and if they're hiring, they will usually train you.  that's another great route.  EDIT: if you're going to play bartender, you probably want mixing glasses as well"
bartenders,3cdg8e,ThelemaAndLouise,2,Tue Jul 7 13:51:37 2015 UTC,"Bar courses, No. Iv been helping my managers weed out proper employees for some time now so maybe I can give you some insight. Your best bet is to start in the trenches as we all have and apply to any and all barbacking/server positions (preferably barback). This is allow you to get a feel for the work you hope to eventually aspire to while still making a wage. Work hard and show that you are reliable and able to handle yourself. Then its just a waiting game till your opportunity comes and you get to show what you've got. Be warned that it may be hard to even get a foot in as you do already have a full time job and in my experience limited availability is often a bummer for hiring managers.

Just follow this one easy trick and you'll land a job: know somebody.  Hang out around bars after work.  Find one you like.  Become a regular.  Talk with the bartenders and barbacks.  Hang out near the service bar and talk to the servers.  You'll stand a much better chance of landing a job if someone (or multiple someones) vouch for you.  Maybe not at the bar you're now a regular at, but if all you want is to get an in, that's the best way.  Resumes are crap and easily faked in the service industry.  Many managers I know tend to toss them (and only write down a name and contact number if it's formatted properly and spelled correctly and whatnot).  Hires are done almost exclusively through an interview which usually only happens after someone else says ""hey that guy is okay""."

Been behind the wood on my own quite a bit this year while still doing a lot of support staff shifts. I'm currently training our new crop of support staff and looking to move into more bartending shifts as the summer ends.   Long story short, make friends and don't be scared to let them know you're serious about starting from the bottom and will work your ass off. Study study study. There's so much more to service than just making drinks. Watch how people work. This includes all staff and not just the bar. Watch videos on proper techniques for dining service. Pick up equipment and practice at home. Learn all of the products a bar offers. Wine, food, beer and spirits."

I can't speak for every city, but in mine every bartender or barback works full-time, or more commonly over-time. It takes years of dedication to be able to just work the weekend shifts. AKA the busiest shifts. And it's still a less than common thing. Serving is another story, and if your goal is something on the side I would stick with that. Bartenders arrive first and leave last. I doubt you want to work 2 full time jobs. I actually work with another bartender who has a ""day job"" and it's a nightmare. She's always late, always wants to leave as soon as possible, and she's always overtired and cranky because she works till midnight and has to get up at 6 every day. And we are a bar that closes quite early. Also don't take a bar course, just get a serving job and pick people's brains and pay attention to what people order and do your own research."

With a small menu (5-10 items) you have to consider if you're covering all the bases. Each item has to be strong and individual. Is there something for everyone?

Basically, we realized we'd save money by installing a new line from Coca-Cola for cranberry cocktail, instead of using bottles and cans. So the Coke guy comes, climbs all through the ceilings and runs the new lines up 3 floors to all soda guns. From a business standpoint, this is actually a pretty good idea.  Fast forward to a week later, I'm downstairs in the liquor room doing inventory. In the blink of an eye, I am pummeled with gallons and gallons of cranberry juice, from the ceiling. Like a bathtub worth of cranberry. It was like a horror movie. Remember when they dump the blood on Carrie? That was me.  Anyway, the Coke guy installed a faulty line, with a leak. The leak built up on top of the ceiling tile, and happened to collapse with me directly underneath it. I went upstairs in my Carrie costume to tell them what happened, and here's where it gets shittier. After dragging me into the kitchen, they got me a new work shirt and told me to get started on the cleanup.  I am fucking red and sticky from head to toe. Don't go home, they said. It'll be fine, they said. OKAY COOL THANKS GUYS. So I stay all night cleaning the fucking liquor room. The next day, they call me into the office.  They said that they didn't appreciate my attitude towards the incident, and that I frightened the members. They then went on to 'let me go' (FIRED) and took $30 out of my last paycheck to pay for the new work shirt. Worst bar job ever.  TL/DR : Ceiling tile and gallons of cranberry juice collapsed on my head because of soda installation mistake. Had to stay and clean it up. Fired the next day for looking like a murder victim.

Old party bus in the back to do blow in, and for a sleazy owner to fuck drunk teens in. The worst part was the music.. Country bar by day, mainstream party rap at night. Started drinking too much..

Simultaneously the best and worst bartending gig... All because of the manager.   The job wasn't that bad. Had some clientelle that I hated on Friday/Saturday night, but they tipped well; we all know that an asshole who tips is better than a nice-guy who does not. Tuesday through Thursday was pretty sweet.   The bar manager, though, was just a hot headed jackass that couldn't do anything except slam out a million drinks a minute. Because of his uncanny bar speed, he was convinced that he was the hottest shit ever. He was extremely short tempered, couldn't manage anything, we lost a lot of inventory, schedules were always fucked up, we were constantly short staffed for anything but the busiest hours (which we were over-staffed), he got in actual fights with the kitchen guys.   This is was first straight up bartending gig after transitioning from the Restaurant-With-a-Bar arena... I was just in shock at how much everyone in the restaurant hated the guy. Unsurprisingly, I was let go for no reason (he straight up said ""no reason, we're just moving on from you,""), I didn't spend much time in conversation since I was one more outburst of his away from quitting anyway. His laying me off was a God-Send. A week later I ended up getting into a very high end restaurant for the rest of the service year until I graduated and got into medicine.   I found out a month later that when the owners found out his letting me go like that was the straw that broke the camel's back and he was fired for it (he was on the edge of getting fired for fighting with the kitchen all the time as it was).     Management can completely make or break any gig."

But even worse was my first gig ever, at a Brazilian steak house. I was more than sure they were taking our tips. There were lots of things that seemed wrong to me. We had this really convoluted tip pool system where you were assigned a percentage of like 9-15, but they would never give me a straight answer about where the other 6 percent went if I was at 9. Additionally I (and the other staff)  knew how much each ticket was because they charged per person, yet I was bringing home under 5 per cent of total sales. Additionally managment would not let us take checks from tables to the cashiers. We would go to pick them up and suddenly a manager would pop out of no where and snag it from us. Basically it came down to no transparency. No one knew how much money there was or where it went. Also I was hired as a bartender... But they had me serving and training all the other staff to do my job. So frustrating."

We didn't have incident reports until I made them, and even now I'm the only one who actually uses them. We regularly run out of necessary product: as of now, I'm out of vodka and won't have any until Thursday. The owner only cares if he breaks even and otherwise won't put money in the place.   I don't fit in, and that's my own fault, but I never really wanted my antics to end up as gossip for the core regs (and they love to talk). They all hang out together, and you are considered strange if you don't. I have nothing against smokers, but I will resent you if you all group up to take smoke breaks every 15 minutes and leave me by myself. Management is rarely here and when they are, they've been drinking. Trying to not escalate a situation is damn near impossible when your drunk supervisor is screaming at the parties involved.   What stinks is that this could be an amazing place if it was run more professionally and looked better, but everyone is more concerned with making friends than running a business. There are some good people here and we have great parties. I make great money. But there are so many damn problems   Fortunately I have another job lined up and some other interviews.

bartenders,3c79qm,dqrambler,3,Mon Jul 6 02:14:40 2015 UTC,"My recent bar I quit two months ago was a blessing and a curse. I learned so much about craft cocktails within 5 months but had to leave due to management and owners. The owner basically opened a gourmet style Tapas bar in a dive/college bar neighborhood. He had no knowledge of the city he was opening his bar in and was against happy hour/specials. ($6 bucks for well doubles, opposed to $2 doubles across the street) Which resulted in very slow nights while I watched the other bars get packed and busy.  My main manager was an anxious ex-heroin addict who thought she was top shit with her pretentious personality. She would accuse me along with my co-workers of stealing bar spoons and other small supplies from the bar, send out harassing text messages at 4AM in the morning, and all around self-righteous person.   My final straw was when I received a voicemail at 3:00AM from her harassing me about forgetting a small task. She asked my co-worker three times to do it and he received no flak. As soon as I forgot, she went all out on me in that message. I pretty much realized at that point she was trying to find a reason to fire me and I put in my two weeks as soon as I could. Never going back there and I know for a fact that bar will be going out of business soon, even the owner said so.

bartenders,3c79qm,modern_rabbit,3,Mon Jul 6 06:08:35 2015 UTC,"Worst gig... Easy. Not so much bartending but from it I know the importance of all the things a bartender needs but doesn't provide themselves.  I was flown over to Barcelona this year to manage the bars of a music festival in a waterpark. Sounds amazing right!? It would have been if they called anyone who had worked in a bar before opening.  Unfortunately, due to their own truly abysmal levels of organisation, myself and the other event managers (ticketing, cash, FoH, stage, etc) arrived on site on Saturday at noon - the festival was scheduled to open at 11am. Good start.  I was introduced to the event organiser and was led to the stock room and handed a single page invoice for approx. 30 cases of spirits. This was to get us through two days of 11am-5am service to a crowd of approx. 1000 in the VIP areas across 3 bars, one of which was for those who paid for ""UNLIMITED DRINKS"" for the weekend. I was then asked to look over the waterpark's stock and to make an instant order on any further alcohol and soft drinks I may need. I had only been on site for 10mins and had had no event briefing. Craziness.  I worked things out, got my stock in place, and even had to make two of the bars make-shift out of spare tables.  Now the real kicker, I asked where the fridges and bar equipment was kept. There was none. No fridges, not even any power, so that means no ice (we're in Barcelona in June), and also no measures and no tills!!! They hadn't even organised a float or enough staff - there was 5 of us for 3 bars....  As you can imagine it slowly turned into chaos and by 9pm the police had come to shut down an event that should never have opened.  Bright side, we were in Barcelona in the sun and was some good tunes getting played.   TL;DR Worked an event bar in Barcelona with not enough stock, no fridges, no tills, no float, no staff. Was an absolute clusterfuck."

I had customers coming up to me in a rage saying they had paid €500 for unlimited drinks for the weekend, but then were told they could only have one measure of alcohol per drink (Although we had no measures and he wanted us to use the caps of the spirit bottles!!!).   Also, had customers saying they had paid €3000 between 6 for a VIP table and 2x 3L bottles of Ciroc Vodka. Only 6 3L bottles were ordered, but there was 5 VIP tables booked (at least 10 bottles needed!)  It was an uphill bitch of battle from minute one and ended as I expected. I definitely won't ever complain about the organisation of an event again as nothing can match that."
bartenders,3c79qm,andyrobbo,2,Tue Jul 7 09:53:47 2015 UTC,"Sports bar was my worst. Had only been pouring for about 6 months when I thought I lucked into the gig. I expressed that I was relatively new and I'd need some decent training in the new digs.  One two-hour training shift then i was thrown to the hounds. I made it through for a couple of months. It truly made me question my choice to bartend at all. The only good servers to get hired would quit or just not show up for shifts because the place was so depressing. I have seen high turnover rates but this place took the cake. We had maybe 10 servers at a time and we had at least 1 or 2 quit each week. The two or three long-time bartenders/servers were horrifically jaded. A customer had one beer (250lb male), said to the female bartender ""hey, that's a really nice dress"". She tells him to fuck off, cuts him off and tries to get me to escort him out. Really nice guy, didn't come off as creepy as all. Just don't be friendly to your servers I guess. This was not a rare occurrence.  We had a few regulars that were clearly depressed alcoholics, and the only way we got people in the bar during the week was our darts league. If not for that, it would have been deserted.  I actually ended up getting fired (coincidentally 2 days before the end of my probationary period so I got no severance) because ""I had rung in about 100 pints of labatt blue in one week and poured them as budweisers instead."" I worked one shift that week, and sold maybe 5 labatt blue. I lucked out and had a better place ring me up with a barback offer a couple weeks after that which is the only reason I'm still in this line of work."

bartenders,3c79qm,Level21,2,Mon Jul 6 13:51:52 2015 UTC,"Mine was a job within a job.  My previous employers tried opening a private club.  They renovated the second floor of their current establishment.  It was nice.  The idea was to sell memberships and provide weekly, monthly, and annual benefits.  The problem was that they couldn't afford to operate the club on a regular basis and restrict access to other guests.   When it started, things went okay, but ultimately they couldn't compete with other private clubs in the area (there were a lot) who were operating daily.  Our club was open Thurdsday though Saturday.  After a few weeks of limiting access to the club lounge, non-members were getting pissed that they couldn't go upstairs.  In some cases when access was allowed to non-members, they were even forced to vacate when planned member events were set to start.  The number of members participating began to dwindle as the weeks went on until the owners were forced to only have member nights once a week, Thursday evenings from 4-11 PM.  I usually got that Thursday night shift.  At most, I'd have 1-2 couples that would come for members night.  I'd make about $10.  I barely made enough to pay for gas.  This went on for a long time."
bartenders,3c79qm,jpgonzo24,5,Mon Jul 6 14:14:04 2015 UTC,"Mine was a chain restaurant called 99. It was all 18 year old girls and me, a 31 year old guy. They had no idea what they were doing. They were brainwashed into thinking however 99 told them to make a drink was the right way. Had one girl told me I was pouring Guiness wrong because youre supposed to stop four different times. I swear I rolled my eyes at least twenty times a shift. Management had rules about people drinking. They werent allowed more than one drink at a time. So no ""a beer and a shot"". And no giving someone another beer if they still had a mouthfull in the one they had. Their reasoning was ""We dont really want people getting drunk here. Try to push the food instead."" It was a really tough place to work.  The straw that broke me though was when they started to make cuts for labor cost. Now I have no problem with cuts. But theyd have two bartenders on a week night and instead of cutting one of the bartenders, they would cut one of the servers and tell us to wait on the tables. I know some people dont mind waiting tables, but if I wanted to I wouldve became a waiter, not a fucking bartender. It didnt help that all the tables were on the other side of the bar entrance. I waited on exactly one table. They ordered water, had to walk around the whole bar to make them, then walk them back. Then they ordered drinks. Same thing. Then food. Walked around to order it. Ten minutes later ran it back. They would not get the fuck up to walk three feet to the bar to tell me if they needed something. Instead theyd wave me over so id have to walk the whole way around. After that I told the other bartender she could take the tables the rest of the night. The next shift they did it again. When I asked why they didnt just cut a bartender the manager said to ""Just wait on the tables and dont worry about who he cuts."" I laughed. I walked behind the bar and started counting tips. He came over and told me I had a table. I handed half the money to the other bartender, and told him ""Go wait on them yourself asshole, im not a fucking waiter. And I quit."" Tossed my apron to him, and laughed as I walked out. The place closed down less than a year later."

But I would say stay in the business long enough work your way up and ask yourself this question again. Any bartender that is in the situation you are describing is handling a lot of responsibility that you don't see. Being a busser is a hard and unforgiving job. You do shitter work for less money but the restaurant business has a hierarchy. The bar is usually a huge revenue producing center for a restaurant, bartenders are paid/ tipped more because they control and grow a lot of value."

Do I think servers should tip bussers way more than bartenders? Absolutely. I'm working with them nonstop all night. Really, that's not even my argument. I was just doing the busser/bartender comparison to show how little work they do for servers compared to bussers (at least at my restaurant).  Unfortunately, I'll probably quit before I ever become a server/bartender/manager (I'm about to finish school up). Doing a little research on tip outs and getting input from /u/SirShale lead me to believe that the bartenders I work with are over-tipped by quite a bit and should probably stop complaining.

You aren't giving them money for the customers you serve. That isn't their problem.    When we make drinks for servers, we are serving their customers too by providing them with beverage service. It's in a more indirect way than the servers who are face-to-face with them, for sure. We make the drinks that their customers want, thereby increasing their check amounts and (hopefully) the tips they get. If there is no bartender, there are no drinks, and the check amount (and their tip) goes down considerably. So that is why servers tip out the bar, because we provide them with a service.  The bartenders don't tip the waiters out because they don't provide us with a direct service."
bartenders,3c9q2r,fortyninecents,2,Mon Jul 6 18:41:54 2015 UTC,By that logic though shouldn't a server tip out a cook more than a bartender?
bartenders,3c9q2r,zdc09,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:15:58 2015 UTC,Not saying bartenders don't deserve tips or that bartenders should be tipping out servers. That would make no sense. I understand that.
bartenders,3c9q2r,hanthemarpoons,6,Tue Jul 7 03:27:56 2015 UTC,"The biggest problem I see is that you're calculating numbers and effort levels based on your restaurant and assuming that's how everyone else's restaurant works. If your bartenders are lazy but receive an absurd 5% tip out from total server sales, then not a single person disagrees with you in this sub, and subsequently the business will have to change its tip out procedures accordingly. Also, we have no server station, so in all your facts you listed as universals, the idea that all night I make 15 drinks for a server doesn't apply, I bet I pour 40 waters per server alone each night, plus sodas, plus every college kid's shot and drink (I know it's the dumbest thing ever to not have a server station). But that's just one example of how some bars can be extremely different from the one you're describing.   What I've picked up on in this sub anytime someone mentions tip out percentages is that every bar is different. If you're in a joint that requires years of craft cocktail knowledge and skill, where your drinks take 60-90seconds a piece, the bartender deserves a more hefty tip out. I use the word ""deserve"" loosely because I think tip outs are crazy, personally, and all costs should be included in price of drink and employees paid based on their value to their company. But, alas, that's not the question at hand. We're discussing the current situation and climate.   I work at a lower end bar that doesn't require extensive knowledge but anyone that is promoted to bartender is promoted because they're fast, efficient, and reliable. If you're a bartender there you're more of a manager to all the servers than anything and they know they can rely on you if something goes wrong or they need help. Every bar is just different, it sounds like your pay out system heavily favors the bartenders and either the culture will change or it won't if nobody does anything. If it's been that way for a while there must not be enough servers complaining or quitting over it to make a change."
bartenders,3c9q2r,baeb66,2,Mon Jul 6 06:32:55 2015 UTC,"I think OP is also not knowing (unless his place is different) that the bartender tips out the barback who stocks all the fruit, the booze, the ice and cleans the glasses so the bartender can create the fine product that makes the customer ever so happy and usually slightly more lose with their money."
bartenders,3c9q2r,PoorProduct,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:54:58 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't think anyone complained because, for the most part, the servers are extremely nice and always seem to tip handsomely, especially if you're a hard worker.  I realize that these numbers aren't universal. As I mentioned in another reply, our place is more of a dining establishment than a bar where I feel many of you work at places that are primarily bars.  I'd say the longest I've seen a drink take to make was about a minute. Rarely people order these outlandish drinks that require a ton of different ingredients. Most people order wine or beer to go with their meal.  At my place, the bartender is the bartender. There are night managers to manage.  Sorry, I suppose I didn't do a good enough job at saying most of these are rough estimates and didn't mean to make them sound like facts.  Thanks, /u/1knightstands."
bartenders,3c9q2r,PoorProduct,3,Mon Jul 6 06:41:51 2015 UTC,"I don't know why you'd be down voted when you're acknowledging that you brought a largely emotional arguments to a discussion you started on the merits of your bar's tip out procedure. You're not wrong to question the bar's policies if it truly feels unfair because of the work required, skill/knowledges required, seniority, etc. Yes your post came off more complaining than discussion oriented, but you acknowledge and understand, so upvote from me."

I tried my best to come off as reasonable as possible. Some people in here just seem to think that I'm complaining that I'm not tipped enough and they're tipped too much I think. That isn't the case at all. Or they think I'm saying their job is easy. Honestly, I feel like they're just not reading entire posts or are seeing red while reading them.  Thanks again for actually reading the shit I'm saying with a level head, lol."

bartenders,3c9q2r,PocketFullOfRain,11,Thu Jul 9 11:14:14 2015 UTC,The same reason your boss makes more than you.  Knowledge and experience.  Respect the bar.
bartenders,3c9q2r,Edgarallenbroo,5,Mon Jul 6 06:56:36 2015 UTC,"There are two main reasons for this. First the bartender has a much higher level of training and is therefore paid more for their time. Second (which actually plays into the first), time spent making your drinks actually takes sales away from the bartender. So the tip out is supposed to compensate them for the time they could have spent making their own tips"
bartenders,3c9q2r,haloti,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:25:06 2015 UTC,"They should be paid more hourly, I agree. The tips are what I don't agree with.  Your second point doesn't make sense to me. How are servers taking away from the bartender in any way?  Thanks for replying."
bartenders,3c9q2r,PocketFullOfRain,3,Mon Jul 6 05:28:07 2015 UTC,The idea is the time spent making that old fashioned could have been used on the bartenders guests resulting in a better tip.
bartenders,3c9q2r,sufjams,-6,Mon Jul 6 05:38:49 2015 UTC,"The customers obviously see that the bartender is making drinks and isn't off aimlessly wandering around, ignoring them. If they aren't understanding of that and they're docking from tips for it, then they're nothing short of an asshole. Also, as far as I can tell, making most drinks and talking to customers isn't an extremely difficult task."

How much of your business is reaccuring?   My VIPs literally get private hosts to make sure their everything is taken care of along with creating the perfect environment that is conducive to them spending a shit ton.  I am not aware of your restaurant or the other's, but a lot of my work is lip work. I do make drinks while I talk, but I also need to keep moving between.   I've bussed, served, and tended bar. I know the hustle and what you're feeling. Use it to rocket yourself up out of bussing. I don't know why it matters what other people tip.   Just do you."
bartenders,3c9q2r,Slapthatbass84,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:19:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know a ton of people are assholes, haha.  Most of our business is travelers. We have a lot of regulars, but most of them are morning people. They don't get any private hosts, but everyone is sure to say hello and they're well taken care of.  Honestly, I don't care if servers tip bartenders 30%, but when you're getting 7% of server's total tips and complaining to management about it (when apparently the standard is 5-10% of alcohol sales or 2-3% of total sales), then I have a problem."
bartenders,3c9q2r,andyrobbo,5,Mon Jul 6 08:27:37 2015 UTC,"My feeling in this industry has always been to keep your mouth shut about tips. When I bussed, I got in the habit of folding the bills into my pocket without counting until the end of the tip outs. I would see my coworkers get worked up over the usual server being tight, and they would invariably do less than stellar work for them. Maybe put their section on a lower priority. Whatever, right?  But then they ruin one of the few great things about the industry: Don't take this shit home with you. It's carried me through some heavy nights and saved my liver, somewhat.   I also don't want to hear the well gossip, who's fucking who.  I was there to work, take my money, and get back home to study.   You're working your way through college, sweet nuts man, you won't have to worry about becoming one of the people who make serving more than a job/career, they make it their life and obsession.  Good luck to you. If you were my busser, I'd tip you."
bartenders,3c9q2r,KINGJAFF,-4,Mon Jul 6 08:41:00 2015 UTC,"No doubt. I found out who the not-so-stellar tippers were and I literally won't look at tips when they're handed to me now. Just stuff 'em in my pocket. There's one server that I basically ignore (she made 255 dollars and tipped me 10 and her bartender 10 one night on a party, lol. Walked out 235 dollars richer and us 10).  I appreciate the compliment. I'd give you my best, haha."
bartenders,3c9q2r,haloti,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:45:35 2015 UTC,"the tip out is to pay the bartender for their time.  the place you works sounds like it sucks, but if a bartender has the option to get a tip from someone at his bar, or make a drink for a server who is not tipping him out, which should he do?  which will he do?"
bartenders,3c9q2r,errycupid,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:55:47 2015 UTC,"The servers DO tip out. As I stated, apparently they're over-tipping them. Honestly, I think they should just do the job they're asked to do and be happy with the tips they're getting, considering it's (apparently) too much."
bartenders,3c9q2r,koota_kinte,3,Tue Jul 7 03:36:43 2015 UTC,"At the restaurant I used to work for, bartenders would also tip out bussers as they would help restocking at the end of the night and taking full dish bins to the washer."
bartenders,3c9q2r,Westcoastbiased,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:16:28 2015 UTC,"Heh, funny you mentioned this.  For the first six months I worked at this place I would carry out bus pans (~3 a night), the garbage when it was full, and carry food out to this one bartender (actually he's the guy doing the majority of the complaining). After SIX MONTHS of this, he gives me a tip.   5 fucking dollars.   Guess who stopped carrying his trash and bus pans.  Thanks for replying.  Edit: Judging by the downvotes, I guess 5 dollars per 6 months is enough. Haha."
bartenders,3c9q2r,randyboozer,2,Mon Jul 6 06:20:34 2015 UTC,"If he's not helping you, why do you help him. That's fucked up. I tip my bussers fat and they help me out a lot. Most of my tip out from servers just goes to the bussers. What's the tip breakdown for your spot?"
bartenders,3c9q2r,Edgarallenbroo,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:07:35 2015 UTC,"I mean, I look at my job as just being an assistant which is really what I am. I'm there to make the server's job as simple as possible. I just extended that to the bartenders. Originally I helped the bartender just be helpful. I stopped once I got that tip. Managers force me to carry his food out, but I won't do anything extra, lol."
bartenders,3c9q2r,Moggehh,2,Mon Jul 6 09:13:53 2015 UTC,"Well are you a 'Server Assistant' or a 'Busser'? I've had both. I tipped out the server assistant more because he would only help me or myself and another server. A busser only busses tables and doesn't have to get me refills, reset after courses, clear after courses, and other finer dinning specifics. I've worked with both S.A.'s and bussers."
bartenders,3c9q2r,Moggehh,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:57:06 2015 UTC,"Hmm. My title is busser, but it sounds like I'm also a server assistant. I bus the tables, but do a lot more than that."

But basically, all I can assume is that you got a job because someone told you to get one.  Like a, we'll only do X if you do Y, type scenario.  You just don't understand what exactly is happening around you because you're not invested in it anyway and it doesn't fucking matter to you in the long run.  Why do you really care if you're going to quit soon?  Also, most bartenders do know how well they have it.  Ugh, you think you are working hard, but you're not even working toward anything.  Good, the industry weeded you out and we look forward to seeing you on the other side of the bar.  Or not since you don't possess the knowledge to even respect the craft on a basic level and likely are a shitty tipper.  And for perspective, servers walk up to a bartender, much like a customer does, and orders a drink.  They also get priority service because they tip so well.  Get it?  Make sense yet?  They're V.I.P. because that's how you balance greed and customer service.  At least I think.  Maybe I'm drunk, bitter and naive.  I had to open the kitchen for the first time in seven months and I wasn't very happy about it."
bartenders,3c9q2r,Edgarallenbroo,0,Mon Jul 6 06:56:28 2015 UTC,"Much of this has been addressed in other replies.  For the things that weren't:  I got a job, because I'm trying to pay myself through college. I'm not invested? I just worked 3 doubles in a row, because other bussers didn't show up or because they called off. I didn't have to work these shifts, but I did.  I didn't make this post on a whim. Do I understand 100% of what bartenders do? No, likely not. I know exactly what they do for servers though.  I care because I get pissed off when people insult the servers I work with.  Working toward anything? I'm working toward making money for college so I can pay off next semester. The fuck? Bartending or managing a restaurant doesn't interest me. Just need to pay the bills.  I tip ridiculous amounts. Why? I don't know. I guess because my mother was once a server and I work with servers and I'm a busser, so I know how shitty these jobs that require tips are."

Servers are fucking lazy, bartenders are fucking lazy.  I've done both FOH and BOH and as far as I can tell, they both suck because the other is typically oblivious to the others work grievances.  In all your replies, putting yourself through college was never mentioned.  I'm working toward baying my rent, paying my bills, and hopefully(avery exasperated ""hopefully"") going to school at 25.  Also, I'm a barback and take a lot of pride in my job and it's duties."

I always try to give all I can and make customers happy. I literally get angry if I see a server clearing a table even though I know they're just trying to help, because I feel like I'm too slow that night. I'm weird....  Very true about people being oblivious to other people's work grievances (like the one guy that seems to think all bussers do is polish glasses and get water and ""stuff"", lol). I'm probably guilty of this myself. And yes, they're both fucking lazy, as are some bussers and cooks, lol. Everyone's got their share of assholes.  I'll ask about how tip outs work with bartenders tomorrow at work to be 100% sure. But I think they're supposed to get some percentage of alcohol sales."
bartenders,3c9q2r,4footgiant,2,Mon Jul 6 07:17:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there are probably places where the bartender is doing a job anyone could do. Even there, though, they need to have the charisma to be the face of the business, and can dictate the vibe of a joint. They also should have a lot of beverage knowledge in their head, and are often relied on as shift supervisors.   In contrast, anyone with work ethic could be a busser or barback anywhere, as it requires very little to no experience. Not saying your situation is fair, or trying to offend you as I don't know the situation at your place, but this is what it's like most places.   Edit: Also, you have to understand that this is just a seniority industry. You're right that some people are just greedy, but it sounds like your complaint is coming from a place of indignation. Don't let that attitude burn bridges, as you have to play the game at your bar to climb the ranks."

bartenders,3c7jpv,IONTOP,2,Mon Jul 6 07:02:33 2015 UTC,"Most states in the US have ""Dram Shop Laws"" which means if someone leaves your bar driving, and injures/kills an innocent person (or a passenger), not only is that person liable, the last bar to serve them (And let them drive) is also liable.

bartenders,3c6dbv,Parkinsonxc,2,Sun Jul 5 08:26:53 2015 UTC,"Not on the lake, but close enough that everyone parks in my neighborhood and then walks down to watch the fireworks so we get a LOT of foot traffic about 15 minutes after they end. After working 2 New Years and 2 (this being my third) 4th of Julys, I know what to expect. We get hit really hard, really fast. 2 bartenders, 1 door guy, 1 cook who helped barback a bit, 1 karaoke host who is also a door guy (Oh yes. We had karaoke tonight too), and somewhere just under 150 guests at any given point in time. We walked with good money but I don't envy you. Helps though that I'm super loopy and running on 3 hours of sleep because it's also my bar's 5th Anniversary weekend and I've been (for the last three months) organizing and facilitating all of the events we've been having since Wednesday and have spent 2 separate nights decorating until 9am.

I frequent lots of divey/neighborhood bars, so when I'm not drinking alcohol at those places I just order sprite with cranberry juice and lime. That's about as fun as it gets at those places for non-alcoholic bevs. Or you could do oj and grenadine... :/  It really just depends on what's on hand at the establishment. Any place that uses fruit purees or fresh squeezed juices should be able to whip something up for you. The main bar I work at, all I can really do is mix some juices together or make a Shirley Temple. My other job, I have a blender and can do a knock-off Orange Julius (sp?), or virgin strawberry daiquiri or margarita.   I say talk to the bartender, let them know you want to spend money and take care of them, but you just want something non-alcoholic. At that point, you've probably got a 50/50 chance that they'll take a moment to make a drink you'll really like.   Also!

Equal parts of each (maybe a bit of simple syrup if you like to taste). Shake the absolute shit out of it in a shaker full of ice. You need to shake it until a pale brown thick foam appears onto. Strain into a martini glass being careful to keep the foam. The final drink should take on the appearence of a shot of espresso- dark brown liquid with a paler brown ""crema"". Freaking delicious and a much better breakfast drink than mimosa or bloody mary."
bartenders,3c0qhn,carolina1406,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:24:59 2015 UTC,"Another one using good chilled espresso is: Vanilla vodka as a base, white and/or dark chocolate liquors, chilled espresso, splash of cream, shake, serve in a martini glass with chocolate garnish.

Pay to play isn't cool, you wouldn't pay someone for the privilege of bartending their party, right?  As for the audience, non-alcoholic drinks should count towards the minimum. Let people stay sober if they want."

They'll just stay home instead. I think you'd be better off cutting your half price burger promo. Food is terrible as a loss leader, because the margins are thin already on food. And if it isn't leading to more sales, it's not acting as a loss leader at all, but merely a loss. Replace it with a drink special on cheap beer, where even if you're knocking a dollar off your price you're still making money. And then advertise to get more heads in the door if you still aren't hitting your numbers.  If you absolutely must go for a two drink minimum, create the policy and then don't enforce it strictly. Social pressure will do a lot of work, and then when you make exception you look merciful."

I know I sure as hell would not.  They're not a draw for anybody other than the performers and maybe some of the friends of performers.  The friends are out there to support their buddy, they're not typical weeknight drinkers, and they leave right after their friend is done.  Most of the performers don't even stick around for the other acts, they leave right after they perform and don't eat or drink much before it.    So, not only are they not a draw AND the performers and their friends are shitty customers, but many of the of the acts are SO terrible that they actually drive out your weeknight regulars who would otherwise listen to a jukebox and have a burger and 3-4 beers.  TLDR: comics and musicians are terrible customers, and the ones who go to ""open mic"" nights are awful and actually drive away good paying customers."

Or maybe try and have some lady put lipstick kisses on them, not sure if that will keep, maybe some sealant will help. You could always ask an artist to draw on them with marker.

But on the rare occasion that someone asks for it, I tell them, ""No, but I have the ingredients"".  99 times out of 100 the individual declines.  Why do you think that is?  Either one of two reasons, 1.)They don't believe/trust me 2.)They need the actual brand because they like to feel like they're on the consumer bandwagon. That doesn't make someone a dickhead so much as a sheep.   I have been told that each generation is a poorer representation of a drinker than the one previous.  Did your grandfather ever order a Remy Martin and Red Bull?  No, not just because it wasn't available, but maybe because they learned to appreciate the flavor of cognac and wouldn't want to mask/ruin it.   I also know a lot of individuals who use the old ""It's my money, what does it matter?"".  Here's where it matters.  Consider the tradition that is put into the production of spirits.  In most cases generations of families have upheld recipes for sometimes hundreds of years and these things are personal to them.  If I took the time to grill you up a filet to a perfect medium rare and you started dumping mayonnaise on it, I'd be a little offended.   Others have said to me ""I don't like the taste of alcohol, I just want to get drunk"".  Doesn't this sound just a tad asshole-ish to you?  The use of what myself and a lot of others in this sub consider sacred just as a prelude to sex with a stranger or a good reason to get in a fight under the age old idea that ""I was just sooooo wasted"" is a damned passport to act like and animal and still feel okay about yourself in the morning.

You probably have terrible taste in some shit, and you don't need someone assuming you're an asshole just because you really want a Leonard Maltin tramp stamp.   The ""your grandfather"" shit is bullshit. My great grandfathers were farmers, coal miners, and pirates. If you think they wouldn't love the shit out of red bull, you're a fool.   As for the people who don't like alcohol but want to get drunk, some of them are assholes, some of them are having a bad day, and some of them are simply engaging in a compulsory social ritual so they don't die alone. Lighten up, and if it's slow, offer to make them a drink that doesn't suck. You're not better than them because you gamed yourself into enjoying campari.

However, allow me to address your points.   1  If you ask for spaghettios and decline my offer for spaghetti, it doesn't necessarily make you an asshole, just a child.   2 Of course I have what others would find to be terrible taste in shit, but if you call me out on it I'd more than likely be able to produce a viable discussion as to why this bullshit is interesting to me.  I seriously doubt that someone could talk me into wasting my money on a extra dirty Grey Goose martini. 3.  Pirates?  Really?  Grow up. 4.  Drinking to get drunk is irresponsible, boorish and just fucking adolescent.  You're having a bad day?  Don't go out in public and get liquored up so other people have to deal with your shit.  I truly don't enjoy Campari at all, but people who do love the shit out of it, I don't get it, but something tells me they didn't ""game themselves into it"". and most importantly 5.

This means a couple things. First, you're going to have to be able to push with concrete results. This means you need to show them that people are coming in because of you. A check in feature, a review feature, what have you. To do that, I'd suggest phases. Phase one, come in as a free app, gather results, find who goes to which bars the most and the least. Phase two, approach the bars that aren't getting the traffic that they could from your app. This isn't to say they all want traffic from your app, but surely, there are bars not getting traffic where the demographic that uses your app would be their target demographic. Offer those bars favorable search results, management tools, etc. Phase 3, move forward from what you have to more areas.  It's all a long shot but it's the only way I see anyone using an app of this sort."

Thank you for the very detailed advice. Actually the check-in feature to count people coming to a bar because of us was in my mind as well. There is a BUT: how to make people check-in through our app at the bar? The only thing that comes to my mind is giving them extra 5% discount, if they check in. iBeacon feature could work as well, but I suspect a lot of trouble setting it up in the bar and integrating it with the app. Can you think of something else?"
bartenders,3bzwbo,Twice_Knightley,2,Mon Jul 6 09:38:02 2015 UTC,"So you want bars to give a discount on top of their already discounted prices, and pay YOU for doing this?

bartenders,3bxahp,IONTOP,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:03:53 2015 UTC,"I'm a consultant and the greatest value of my fee comes from setting up an inventory system. Here are some concepts you will want to consider:  Does your pos programming allow you to get accurate info about what it's being sold? If not you need to do a full reprogram.   You won't realistically be able to track cocktail ingredient usage if off the cuff creativity is a part of your concept. If this is the case, you will need to create an amoritization system to track your cocktail ingredient usage. There are infinite ways to do this. Some good, some bad.   Your spreadsheet will take at least 20 hours to create if you have more than 100 spirits to track, and say at least 10 cocktails to track. Keep in mind that it will also take on average 5-10 hours a month to accurately maintain this record, not counting inventory counting.   Weighing is good, but counting tenths of bottles is more practical. You will need 1 caller and 1 recorder. Don't try to lump all bottles of a single type into a reading. Take separate readings for back bar, wells, liquor room etc... And add them together at the end. If you don't you'll fuck up the reading and generate garbage data.  And... Every bar is different. Adjust based on your needs."

bartenders,3bxbbl,ivegotyounow,3,Thu Jul 2 22:38:39 2015 UTC,"right,  What cocktails/drinks are you serving? you said she wanted specific ones, WHICH ones? same goes for wine and beer, what kind of beer and what kind of wine.     With cocktails/mixed drinks there is a great distinction between the so called 'bottom shelf' and 'top shelf' ingredients used, meaning that the ingredients can vary greatly in quality (and thusly, price) despite being the 'same'. For example, Vodka, a fairly common alcohol, is availlable across all price ranges, from the cheap well vodkas that taste like sadness to high end ones like Cîroc, Beluga, ketel one that can cost you an arm and leg, and everything in between. It's the same for virtually any cocktail ingredient, there's cheap shit and there's overpriced glamour.     The best way to deal with this is to EXACTLY know what you want and how much money you can spend, from there, look at the possibilities. The issue with these kinda things isnt what's possible (since almost everything is possible in the service industry), but how much you're able to pay for it.     Once you've got a clear budget and idea of what you want and a VERY good idea of how many people are coming, you can start looking/asking around. I'd suggest starting with the hotel that hosts the wedding. You mentioned it being very fancy/high end right? If that's the case, most good higher end/fancy hotels have their own restaurants and bars with a broad selection of drinks. Maybe ask the hotel how much'll cost to hire a (couple) bartender(s) for the night/day.     As for the tips, it's entirely up to you, assuming you're paying a decent wage to begin with. Being an european in the restaurant business rather than bar, i'm not entirely sure what is a proper wage for a bartender in america, but most international hotel 'tenders get paid fairly well I do know. maybe the other pro's in here can shed some light on that? how much do you take home NET after a single shift? Something i'd do in your situation is to find a (couple of) bartender(s) and negotiate a base wage sans tips, add a clear tipping pot at the bar and pay an additional 10-20% of their shift wage afterwards as a sort of suprise/bonus to them? I really dont know.     Just my tip, a lovely drink for a wedding would be a 'Kir Royal'. A pale pink french drink made of one part 'crème de cassis' (a classic blackcurrant liqueur) and 7 to 9 parts of champagne or other good sparkling wines, have had great succes with both cavas and proseccos. as a bonus, they also tend to be better in price/quality when drunk on its own (but dont tell the french that :p)."
bartenders,3bxbbl,sagebeard,2,Thu Jul 2 23:36:15 2015 UTC,"I like you! Tha k you so much. Honestly i have noooo idea when it comes to alcohol. Beer and wine will be purchased by ""us"" but she would like to leave mixed drinks up t the bartender. Even wants to print up tiny cute drink menus -.- not my wedding so i guess she can spend as she sees fit really.   The hotel does offer their own staff but charge a ginormous fee.

bartenders,3bxbbl,VancouverSpecial,3,Fri Jul 3 00:00:07 2015 UTC,"The venue might have a list of bartenders they like to deal with, or be otherwise able to recommend someone, (they probably deal with stuff like this all the time).

I would recommend going to a bar that serves the kind of drinks you'd like at the wedding, and then finding a bartender you like that works there.   As far as tipping goes, if this is supposed to be a classy event, I wouldn't have tipping at all. Pay the bartender what they're worth (I would project anywhere between $500-$800 depending on how much work you're expecting on this cocktail menu, if it's a large wedding, you might need to pay even more to have more bartenders) and provide a seamless experience for your guests. Some of them will tip anyway, and it's a much classier experience than asking people to dig out their wallet at a wedding."

The drinker believes that the addition of a copper mug adds sophistication, when in fact, in 1941 the cocktail was made up by two individuals who had an overabundance of ginger beer and copper mugs.  They took pictures of all the affluent bartenders in New York posing with these mugs and a bottle of Smirnoff and boom, the first cocktail popularized by the media was born."
bartenders,3bur0n,daddyfatsac,13,Thu Jul 2 14:20:47 2015 UTC,"It was Los Angeles that the drink was created. At 'The Cock & Bull' restaurant on Sunset blvd. the Smirnoff salesman would take photos of people with the mugs and Smirnoff but it wasn't influential bartenders. It was other bar managers and customers along the strip. He would take these photos to different bars and exclaim that EVERYONE was buying Smirnoff and that they shouldn't miss the boat. The reason for this wasn't simply to unload an overstocked of copper mugs but to introduce people to this new alcohol called vodka. Smirnoff was the first American owned vodka and at the time we were very much a gin culture. Vodka was weird and didn't have a market. Mixing vodka with Cock & Bull's famous (even at the time) ginger beer was the original idea. The copper mug came into play when the bar manager struck a deal with the vodka rep and gave a bunch of mugs in exchange for a better price on the vodka. (He made a bad business deal and was left with a shitload of mugs) The whole ""mule"" part of the name and drink came into play because the original copper mugs had two mules kicking each other on them and some had little name plates to engrave below the two mules. Cock & Bull had a ""drop down"" bar and would hang their mugs with different regulars and famous actors names on the mugs. When these guests would walk in, no matter what they were drinking, would enjoy their cocktails in their mug.  Also, Smirnoff was one of the first actor endorsed spirits. It kinda killed the gin industry slowly over the next 10yrs.  So, long story longer, it's always been an introductory drink. It was a drink to introduce people to vodka and now it's something people use to introduce themselves to drinking."

bartenders,3bun7n,emizeko,2,Sun Jul 12 17:26:21 2015 UTC,"I don't even know how to whittle it down to the two biggest changes. The entire drinking culture as a whole has completely shifted. Gone are the days of Adios Mother Fuckers and Liquid Cocaine shots (for the most part). Classic cocktails are back in a big way, everyone expects you to be able to handle a ""dealers choice"" type of drink (at least where I work). Vodka is fading fast, whiskey and gin are more popular and rum (proper rum not Captain Morgan) is on the rise. The public has discovered that alcohol actually tastes good when you have good product and not rot gut wells. Fresh juice and house made syrups have become the norm. Soda guns are fading out. People want fresh quality drinks."

bartenders,3bt0n9,SoonerStan,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:12:41 2015 UTC,That's weird. I'm a barback in a busy joint with 24 taps and a shitty tiny walk-in.  Last night I found out our new rep doesn't fucking know how a bar works and uses no forethought when stacking kegs.  Now I get to come in and throw kegs every which way until it makes some sort of fucking sense.  I want to lynch the motherfucker but he comes before my shift.
bartenders,3bt0n9,PocketFullOfRain,5,Thu Jul 2 17:07:08 2015 UTC,"I'm 5' 11"" 170lbs and I lift kegs all the time at work no problem.  Just plan ahead.  If you gotta lift a keg make sure you have enough room and don't lift with your back for God's sake.  It's not shameful to ask for help if it's around just to be safe.  If you gotta lift a keg onto a raised shelf like I do put a keg down in front of the shelf, stack the keg you're moving,  and lift it up from there with your legs. Like other people have said,  if you feel one falling just make sure you are out of harms way. Those things will crush your feet bones like twigs.  You will be just fine if you are safe and always aware.  Never rush yourself."
bartenders,3bt0n9,nuworldblue,5,Thu Jul 2 01:09:16 2015 UTC,"Take a look at some deadlifting material/videos. Basically, there are gonna be three rules of thumb applicable to the kegs:   keep the weight close to your body. establish a flat back position and do NOT change it. (Change in spinal shape is what's gonna mess up your back) don't try to jerk the weight up with momentum (injury alert!!) Pull ""on tension"" - tighten your muscles like your already lifting - take a deep breath and hold it in, then begin to lift with your legs.   If you gotta stack em, once you've lifted the keg, carefully use your thigh to nudge/gently swing it upwards so you can rest the bottom edge on the top edge of the keg you're stacking it on top of... then use your bodyweight to push it the rest of the way up!  Practice with smaller kegs/half kegs first if you have them to get the basic movement down.  As always, SAFETY FIRST! You're probably more than capable to lift one, but moving them around can be tricky business. Ask someone who has worked in the bar for a while to show you how they do it (always a flattering request, trust me!)  At the end of the day, no job is worth your health, so never hesitate to ask for help. A bar that would deny you it is not one worth working in."

bartenders,3bt0n9,ThelemaAndLouise,2,Thu Jul 2 03:48:05 2015 UTC,"lift with your legs is true, but you might want to look into how deadlifts are properly done, because it's about lifting a huge load using your posterior chain in a way that won't blow out your back.  not practical for keg shapes, but good shit to know."

I was 6' 165 and carried kegs up 2 flights through the crowd. Just tuck the keg into your body and if it feels like its going to pull something stop, and slowly put it back down. DO use your legs and isolate your back. Pull your shoulder blades together without arching the lower back.  Talk to a Lunk Head they can explain it better."

They know line dogs, door guys, servers, barbacks, chefs, prep, bartenders ALL -stereotypically-drink more than average, and tip way more than your average punter.   A real  bar that naturally attracts industry effortlessly is the best thing on the planet. Generally, the juke rules, the non-jiggered shots are heavy, the war stories of the weeds are plentiful, and the money is good. If I could open a bar that only opened at 11 pm, & only served industry, and stayed open til 6 or 7 am, and no one else was allowed except friends of industry or friends of friends, I would.   Bless the line dogs. Bless the barbacks. Bless the 'tenders & even the goddamn servers.   & when frat bro asks why he waited 30 seconds longer for a drink coz he was here first & that other dude got served quickly, and he's stated clearly "" I'll take care of you, bro"" over & over yet still tips $1 on $20, and the other dude tips $10 on $6, holding that cash up explains it all, wordlessly.

bartenders,3bsv8x,heyitsfap,3,Thu Jul 2 00:23:51 2015 UTC,"Unless you are stopping by exclusively dive bars business casual will leave an excellent impression. Have clean nails, natural looking makeup, wrinkle free clothing and a smile. Do not dress slutty, do not be overly flirtatious and make sure to bring a pen. Be honest about your level of experience, because they WILL figure out if you are lying quickly. The most important thing is to make sure they know you are excited about the opportunity, professional and looking to grow into a new industry.  Another solid foot in the door is to work as a server in a restaurant. You can make it clear in the interview you want to transition into the bar. With this avenue you will really have to prove yourself though.  LA is a very competitive market, however you will always have dozens of jobs available to you. Sex appeal is a strong weapon, but professionalism, speed and product knowledge will create a career.  Edit: Also, if you have not worked in the service industry before, get ready. We work when other people party, we miss holidays and the hours can be long. Depending on the bar you could easily be working past 3 every night closing up."

bartenders,3bqrnl,pefyeah,2,Wed Jul 1 16:07:35 2015 UTC,"D.C. doesn't allow managers to take money from tip pools, although it does allow tip pooling. Some states don't allow pooling, so managers can't take tips in those places.  The laws are really region specific.  ETA: I suppose if a manager was making tipped wage ($2.77/hr in D.C.) they could qualify for the tip pool. The law specifically prohibits full wage earners who normally aren't tipped from taking from the pool."
bartenders,3bqrnl,EusociallyAwkward,0,Wed Jul 1 18:32:11 2015 UTC,"It's illegal as fuck  No employers are allowed in the pool. Tips belong to employees, not to the company. And, under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), the federal law that governs wages and hours, ""employer"" includes not just the owner or officers of a company, but anyone who acts in the employer's interests regarding an employee.

bartenders,3bpwgu,Figonometry,7,Wed Jul 1 04:58:15 2015 UTC,"I won't speak to the sense of using flavored vodka if you already have a liqueur that does the job, but layering similar flavors is something that I've found to be quite effective.   The idea is that even if two products ostensibly have the same flavor, there's going to be differences in how they taste. Orange liqueur and orange bitters are both ostensibly orange flavored, but in reality they each capture different aspects of orange-ness. So if you put both of them in a drink, instead of it kind of tasting like orange a little, or only tasting like the bitter (or sweet) part of orange taste, you get a very complete and unmistakable taste of orange that you wouldn't get if you only included one or the other."

I usually test my drinks on customers, and say if they give me a good name that's what it'll be called. Keeps em excited."
bartenders,3bncp6,RepealedLaw,2,Tue Jun 30 20:23:28 2015 UTC,"Snap + Habanero shrubs   That sounds really interesting. Snap is a really nice liqueur and I've had a lot of luck with it and lemon juice and fresh ginger and bitters (which help cut some of the sweetness and match the spices well).   I usually test my drinks on customers, and say if they give me a good name that's what it'll be called. Keeps em excited.   That sounds like a lot of fun. Great idea!"

How often do you start from scratch vs. modify an existing recipe? >Usually if I start from scratch, I pick a spirit and some flavors (citrus, spicy, etc.) Then it's pretty much taste test til I have an ""ah-ha!"" moment. What's the hardest part about making a new recipe? >I think for me it's trying to stick with a simple recipe. Does it take you multiple sessions to finalize a recipe? >I wouldn't say multiple sessions. I try and stick with it at one time, but sometimes you have to let it sit and come back to it. Do you try your recipes out on other people before finalizing them? >Yes. I try and get a few people to try it. Usually if I get a 50/50 I'll keep the recipe. You can't please everyone! Have you made a drink, loved it, forgotten to write it down, and not been able to make it again? >Sadly yes How do you write down your recipes? Notebook? Recipe cards? >I use a small notebook. For my bar I have note cards since I don't bring all my recipes to work. Have you gotten recipes on your bar menu? Did anyone help you on the final version or did it go on without edit? >I have a full drink menu I created at my club, there were minor edits (mostly for cost effectiveness), but nothing that tweaked the drink substantially. Total 8 drinks, 1 ""reinvented"" and 1 ""bomb"" shot (redbull + shot. not my choice lol).  The other 6 drinks are completely mine which I am very very proud of :) How do you name drinks? >I am terrible at naming anything.

I'm not used to a law like that, and I'm not sure I'd like having it around.  I live in a state the parent's can't buy booze for their kids.    A few days ago I had a pompous kid try to order a beer and I asked for his ID. Classic, ""Oh crap I forgot my wallet"".  Dad tried to lie and tell me he is 21 and to serve him.  Long story short one of his 19 year old classmates works with us, tipped me off, and when I saw the dad pouring beer in an opaque cup the manager took charge.  Dad threw one of the biggest tantrums I've ever seen.  Said he was a lawyer (he's not), said he knew the owners (he doesn't), and said he'd bring his son's ID in the next day (he didn't).  Their group dumped their entire two buckets of beer and drinks all over on the table and left.   I just don't get people sometimes.  But all I know is that is one less asshole in my bar."

After that, a lot is just experience and learning flavor profiles and how various things work together to get the flavors you're looking for.  Teaching the newbies the correct pours is also the best thing you can do for them.

bartenders,3bgmrk,indepthis,7,Mon Jun 29 03:14:44 2015 UTC,"This is terrible advice. There is an advantage to having informal authority in any workplace, and this alone completely negates your argument that teaching some young kid how to bartend will land you in some fucked up situation where you'll be fired because the kid is cheaper. Unless the management and the establishment is completely fucked, that will never happen. Not only that, but everyone needs to be able to rely on one another behind the bar. Where I work, we are a team, and everyone needs to be able to pull their own weight. If not, I'm splitting my tips with a bunch of fucking freeloaders while I bust my ass to make sure everything runs smoothly. Not only that, but a shitty bartender not only costs me the tips we DO earn, but any potential earnings lost because they suck. Your image isn't brutal, it's short-sighted and unhealthy to any kind of environment a good bartender ought to want to be a part of. In this case, ""looking after your own house"" coincides with looking after theirs."

The wanting to teach is more because they sling the new hires in with me on a Friday and Saturday night, which are usually the days I'm doing 9/10 hour shifts and without some help, they new people would be pretty much toast and the whole bar would just fail.

In general, my advice is the same as other posters. Find a place you like and grind as a barback, keep stomping the pavement, or go corporate if it won't destroy your soul.

bartenders,3bg65c,bsweetness87,2,Mon Jun 29 01:29:08 2015 UTC,Networking is your most important tool.  Make friends with a bartender or two in the city and figure out what you need to do to get hired. I'm guessing moving into the city proper your competition has moved up a notch.  Maybe check out USBG Maryland?  Show an effort to be more than a dive bartender.  First level Cicerone or Barsmarts Wired are a good starting point. Also if you left on good terms reference letters help. Or see if your previous coworkers or employer have contacts for you.
bartenders,3bg65c,anyd,2,Mon Jun 29 06:59:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks guys, great tips. Sometimes it's hard to weigh your options when your back is against the wall, haha.  anyd Last night, a local bartender suggested I join the Baltimore Bartenders' Guild. The member list has some big local names it would be great to get to know, if only for their knowledge. That's more of a strategy for the future after gaining upscale bar experience, but it's a good card to have up my sleeve. And some previous managers and coworkers do know some people in the city, now that I think of it. I'm using some of the managers as references, but letters from them might be more effectual. I'll ask them later today.  bsweetness87 I never considered bar backing, but I guess that would be a good way to get a foot in the door somewhere above my reach. I've wanted to work in a cocktail bar since the beginning, and this might be the best way to get there.  ThelemaAndLouise Unfortunately, you make a good point.

Which runs straight across the board more or less. So while that means more people are exploring their taste in bourbon, but you'll also see more sophisticated gin drinkers, more beer nerds, etc.   But nightclubs are still nightclubs. You might end up having more people who want to try a real cocktail, but because they exclusively drink vodka soda they have no idea what to ask for or how to ask for it.

Micro brews are huge (and Asheville has gained national recognition for it), and you'll likely find yourself needing to brush up on that no matter what bar you land yourself behind. Even sports bars are catering to that crowd. However, many of these places are ran by the green bar managers in that they put together shitty beer lists.

The PDT book is good, but in my eye the hands down best beginner's bartending book is Gary Regan's Joy of Mixology. PDT is all well and good, but it's more of a fancy recipe book than an instructional manual."
bartenders,3bdo52,steverino1,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:25:42 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about the downvotes, a lot of people here like making newbie's day hard.  Being consistent is a key to being a good bartender. Make every drink be as good as you can.  I don't know what sort of book the PDT one is, but you will memorize the drinks by doing them. This far I've mostly dealt with simple cocktails like Gin & Tonic or so on, so nothing too fancy just yet for you to trouble yourself with. Tom Collins and a Mojito are a must though, and many people fuck them up, even with years of experience.  Like others stated here, strainer and nozzles for few bottles and a shaker. A boston or cobbler, it is up to you.   I don't like the idea of diving into the freepour just yet, but for the standard 2cl and 4cl used in Finland, a ""Onethousand and one, onethousand and two"" count gives you 4cl. This, of course varies with the nozzle. Here in Scandinavia we have standardized slow, medium and fast nozzles, so jigger is your friend like stated before, to find out what speed your nozzle pours at.  If you have any questions I'm happy to help if I can :)  Oh, and after you've got the necessary stuff to make cocktails with... invest into good shoes! Your back will thank you. Spending 80 bucks for good shoes is not too expensive on the long run, trust me."

Secondly, I'm not well versed in legal statutes for OP's jurisdiction. That said, firing someone for not serving an intoxicated individual can open up an employer to all sorts of liability, even in right to work states. Also, as a hiring manager, if a potential employee told me that they were fired for not serving the manager's drunk friend I wouldn't have any qualms hiring that person. If I were OP I would be looking for a new gig, anyway. I love my boss, and I've had plenty of offers to work for other employers I love just as much.

Plot twist : He's the owners baby daddy, no financial stake in the bar. Later, I get called in for an employee review where I am accused of drinking before work (I drank before that meeting) and given a warning.

bartenders,3b734j,Gaywaii,17,Fri Jun 26 14:29:51 2015 UTC,"Basics of Bartending: Always have a lighter and a wine key on you.  Learn 150-200 Standard recipes.   Scope out/Set up the bar - load up your ice. count your float set-up and know the order of your “speed rack” (vodka, gin, rum, triple sec, tequila, bourbon and scotch. etc)  In your speed rack you will have your most commonly used “call” liqours. (when someone names the specific liqiour they want in their drink). Vodka is generally the highest seller, hense having it on the far right of the speed rack for easiest access. Wipe the bar down and ensure it is clean. Always have your cloth folded into a rectancle. Bar mop is for bar. Bar towel is for wiping down glasses. Always put a napkin down when new people arrive.  When your prepare a stack of napkins, You can feather them by twisting your hands the opposite way of eachother. Napkin hard edge so easy to grab for barteder.  Cutting fruit. Lime: cut it in half, cut a slit in middle and then cut from inside of lime to make at least 8 wedges. The slit is for so when you put the lime on the drink you can stick it right on the edge.  Lemon: cut ends off first. then in half. then in slices. IF, making a lemon twist. Cut the ends off, then, cut a slit in peel, then use a spoon to dig lemon away from peel, your will end up with just the peel which you will then cut into wedges to put as twists in drinks.  If using a twist to put in a drink (ex, scotch on rocks) you dont have to rim the glass but if you do, use the outside part of the lemon as the inside is bitter.  You always have to twist it so that the smell comes out.  Fill garnish tray; Cherries, Olives, Lime wedges, Lemon wheels, and lemon wedges or orange wedges.  Glasswear;  rocks, highball, tall.  When going to new bar, ask what drink portions are for alcohol. Rocks glasses are for straight liqour on the rocks.  Highball are for mixed drinks. They are usually self discriptive, (scotch and soda, Vodka and Tonic.)  With glasswear, Ensure to do visual checks on what an ounce looks like in a glass, an ounce and a ¼, ounce and a ½, etc.  If the bosses require to pour a shotglass first, keep it above the glass, pour and dump.  Martini’s Martini, manhattan, and rob roy and stirred martinis.  However, the trend these days is everyone wants everything shaken.  For martini shaking; put ice in a tall glass, put in your mix, put your shaker on top with one straight edge. Put your thumb on the straight edge and shake over your shoulder with confidence.  If your pouring shots, use a strainer and get them out quick. If pouring one glass and not busy. Can leave the shaker on the glass, and block the ice with it to pour it in a neat way from the middle of glass and shaker.  If stirring, use method from video with stir spoon.  Martinis are vodka or gin.  Manhattan’s Classic Dash of bitters, Bourbon, and Sweet vermouth. ⅔ ratio sweet vermouth to bourbon.  Manhattan gets a cherry.  Dry No Bitters. Bourbon and Dry vermouth with same 2 - 3 ratio.  Olive instead of cherry.  Perfect No Bitters, Sweet and Dry vermouth, And Bourbon. Same ratio.  Garnish in perfects are lemon twists.   Rob Roys are the same however you use Scotch instead of bourbon.   Ole Fashioned Traditional; a sugar cube, dash of bitters, and water. Muddle it. Top with ice. Then add bourbon. Skewer an orange and a cherry. Add stirstick.  Newer/More accepted way; Sugar cube, bitters, orange and cherry, then Soda water instead of water. Top with ice. Then add bourbon.   Vodka cranberries Alot of drinks involve vodka, cranberry and then one other ingredient.  Vodka & Cranberry is a cape cod. (can add a lime.) Vodka, half cran and half grapefruit juice is a sea breeze.  Vodka, cran, and pineapple juice is a bay breeze.  Vodka, cran, orange juice is a Madras.  Vodka, orange is a screwdriver.  Vodka grapefruit is a grey hound. Salty dog is salted rim.   Pouring.  keep one finger on the spout as sometimes they are a little loose and it wont fall out.  Always try to be using two hands. When pouring, put your shaker down, then pour with hands two ingredients.  dont hide your work. your bar is your work bench.  Serving Wine Present label to whoever ordered the wine.  Cut the foil off, Face label to the customers, Put cork out and place in front of the person who ordered the wine. Then give them a small taste.  Guy in video suggests leaving wine glass on table, hold bottom of wine bottle with palm up, and reach and pour in front of customer.  Table positioning When you are at a table or bar. Keep track of the seats starting from your left as seat 1 and go around the table, seat 2, seat 3, seat 4 being on your right. Then position the drinks you make in the same order on your drink tray.  You can still serve the women first if you'd like but remember the seat assignments.  if you have a notepad, Also use shortcuts. VT=Vodka Tonic, RC=Rum Coke, Figure out shortcuts for everything."

bartenders,3b734j,kgbyrne,2,Fri Jun 26 20:10:50 2015 UTC,"the joy of mixology is a good book that classifies drinks in easy ways to remember.  in addition to those classifications, i would recommend grouping cocktails by ratios.  you'll have some 2:1 cocktails (godfather, black russian, manhattan).  the white russian is 2:1:1.  martinis and a few other beverages are basically 5:1 standard.  sours are often 3:2:1 or 4:2:1.  ratios differ according to different people, though.  also, most fizzes are basically sours with soda water.  collins drinks are basically fizzes with muddled fruit.  a french 76 is a tom collins with champagne instead of soda water.  approaching drinks like this will help you remember stuff.  that being said, ask the person who hired you what the 10 or 20 most ordered drinks are, and write the measurements really tiny on a 3x5 card and keep it under the bar."

bartenders,3b734j,joethebartender,3,Fri Jun 26 18:55:46 2015 UTC,"Most important questions - what country are you in, and what kind of bar are you at? The things you need to know for an American craft cocktail bar are entirely different from an English traditional pub or a hotel bar or a nightclub or a sports bar.  But basically...   Look at what products your bar stocks and do some basic googling to familiarize yourself with what they actually are.  Make sure you have a bottle opener (wine key or bar blade, depends on whether you prefer quicker/easier/flashier bottle opening or having a corkscrew on you - which pretty much comes down to how much corked wine your place sells).  Get decent but cheap shoes - comfort is important but be aware that whatever you wear they'll fall apart in six months behind the bar. Familiarize yourself with the basic terms used when ordering drinks: doubles, shandies, tops, up or on the rocks, etc. Don't get flustered when you fuck up. You will, inevitably. Everyone does. What your employers want to see is how you deal with your fuck ups. Stay calm, keep smiling, work out how to fix it and do it. Bar work is as much (or more) about personality than skills. If you're seventeen and behind the bar, you'll be supervised. This means that there should always be someone on hand to ask if you get stuck out of your depth. Don't flounder if a customer asks you something you don't know the answer to, just be honest and tell them that you're sorry, you haven't been working the bar long and pull aside someone who does know when they're free. 99% of the time, the customers will be perfectly happy with this. If they're not, then they're generally the type of customer who is looking for a reason to complain and there's nothing you can really do about that."

bartenders,3b734j,HoldOnOneSecond,2,Sat Jun 27 20:17:40 2015 UTC,"I started 6 months ago in a smallish bar attached to a restaurant and was exactly as clueless as you. Don't be afraid to ask for help, and if your co workers tell you something for the second/third time, just smile and thank them, they are just trying to help.  Take some time to talk with the other barstaff and figure out what you have in the bar, which beer/wines you have, and which of those is most popular. If you have a slow shift, cleaning the backbar is a good way to not only keep the bar looking great but also familiarize yourself with what spirits/ liqueurs you have on hand.  Above all, keep a permanent smile on your face, even when no one's at the bar, and have fun :)"

bartenders,3b41th,easyj86,6,Fri Jun 26 00:09:16 2015 UTC,Using large cubes (the next step) keeps spirits cold without watering them down a lot. A lot of cocktail bars use large cubes for this reason.
bartenders,3b41th,Slapthatbass84,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:58:45 2015 UTC,"This might be a myth if I remember college physics/chemistry correctly. Most of your temp change comes from the state change from ice to water. The state change itself takes over 300 joules per gram, whereas it takes only about 4 joules to heat a gram of water one degree Celsius. So you'd be getting basically the same amount of cooling per water generated regardless of the shape of the ice."

The whole magic of bartending is that you are creating a delicious beverage from scratch with what's in front of you. Molding a perfect, circular ice cube as a part of the drink is even more intimate.   What's being shown in the video is the prep work for this thing which we use at the bar.   But I guess some people don't care for craft cocktail bars at all. There's probably a lot that goes on at these bars they'd consider pretentious."

bartenders,3b41th,sufjams,0,Fri Jun 26 13:00:56 2015 UTC,"So taking a huge piece of ice and sawing it into smaller pieces as prep to then be made into even smaller pieces to be put into a glass.  This sounds horrible. So in the downtime as a bartender I am sawing ice rather than engaging my customers?  I guess, beyond me believing that it is unnecessary, I can't imagine what happens when the bar gets busy.  Is there over staffing to compensate?  What if you need ice and one bartender isn't as fast at sawing ice as another?  Is there someone who is solely responsible for sawing while others make drinks?"
bartenders,3b41th,sufjams,2,Fri Jun 26 13:15:22 2015 UTC,"The process is different in every bar. There are people willing to pay for artisan ice, so why not sell it to them?

I'm originally from the UK, but have a U.S. Passport/citizenship  thanks to my American mum. I have researched extensively to try to have friends work here. There are 2 options:  Student work ""j1"" visa (easier but expensive) if you are a student or recent graduate you might be able to apply through a proxy company to work here for a up to 4 months, plus one month traveling. If you're a graduate, this needs to be related to your degree. This is super expensive though; not worth it if you're plan is to make money/ career out of it.   Work visa For everyone else: You need to have a job offer from a company and it can't be ""stealing jobs from Americans"", which will be assessed by the government. There are then a ton of hoops to jump through. This is normally for well known/ highly skilled or people who work for international companies. You're best bet would be to come over, make an impression with someone you want to work for, and have them sponsor you. But that gets expensive for the employer. If you're bringing unique  expertise and an awesome attitude then there might be a chance. I once landed a job when my ""Unique skill to bring to the team"" with was ""I have an English accent."" I was drunk when I filled that app. out.   Or you could come over here (with a return ticket) and work for someone under the table. Highly illegal, and if your caught you'll be deported, and probably banned. But there are lots of small little places that don't really check credentials....."

Loyalty is great for customers but here loyalty is crap for employees.  I've regretted not taking numerous jobs because I felt like the place gave me a decent working situation.  Try to get a ""last call"" gig, those are the best places because you'll get the servers and managers coming in from other restaurants after the close.  Be good to them, they'll be good to you and you'll be first in line after a bartender quits.    Edit: Also if you get the last call gig, you'll meet so many bartenders who will vouch for you.  They will say ""This person at XXX place has been there for a while, and he's a solid person and bartender, I would almost put my name on the line for this person"""

(Usually there's at least one older one that I can use, or someone who isn't drinking as much as the rest of them.)  I tell them they are my helper buddy, then use as many ways as I can think of to manipulate them to help me keep their friends at a decently sober level using my authority as The Bartender.  ""Yo, you're going to be my help tonight. I can tell you are someone I can rely on. I'm going to let you know if I see anyone who needs a water break and you can help me take care of them.""  (Insert various other manipulations.) It sounds wacky in print but I've used this for years and buddy rarely let's me down. There's always someone that likes the idea of being helpful, you've just got to pick them well. If one of their friends is soon going to need to be cut off, I let my buddy know and they diligently stop ordering them shots, or convince them they can taste alcohol in the juice I give their friend.   This works best in smaller groups, but I've used it to effectively manage a large group too.   As for large groups doing a ton of shots, I tell everyone in advance what the rules are. Make a shot rule as soon as you can tell they plan on doing a bunch of them: ""Ok guys, we have one rule for shots. Only one every (half hour, hour or whatever), and one glass of water in between. You can drink all night as long as you obey the rule.""  Older people will scoff at this, but 18 year old kids new to the bar scene will listen. Play good cop bad cop. You're the good cop, you want to give them more. But the Bar and the Shot Rule prohibit you from doing that."

bartenders,3b0jrk,Mitch_from_Boston,2,Thu Jun 25 10:46:31 2015 UTC,"Americans and the Irish certainly have different approaches to drinking.  The Americans tend to show up to the bar sober, or near sober, and drink hard alcohol and get blackout drunk while at the bar.  The Irish tend to show up barely able to stand, and if by chance they get in, they drink light beer or cider until they sober up.    So from my experience, the Irish J-1s I deal with usually cause more problems because of already being intoxicated."

You might be able to get on as a barback and work your way up, but no place worth working at is going to put you on as a bartender for the biggest night of the week with the best money if you have no experience.  You might be able to find what you're looking for, or work your way up to what you're looking for, but it might be tough to find."

bartenders,3b1i9w,swerrve,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:51:07 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be as critical of bartender schools as you, but definitely bartending is a trade where experience takes presidency. I took a 4-week course, and I don't think that anything shorter than that will have the time to teach you both basics of practically tending bar (pouring technique, routines etc.) and give you a good basis for making drinks (a good selection of standard recipes, some insight into spirits and their history, etc.) - personally, that kind of course gave me a good basis, and allowed me to discover I specifically wanted to get into a certain level of cocktail bartending, specifically getting tips from one of the instructors on a good beginner's book.  Should you be specifically interested in cocktail bartending, however, you may get by on reading a few cocktail books for starters, and then throwing yourself into an application process. Make sure to be specific about why you find the trade interesting, and also mention that you've read this-and-this book and have a selection of recipes down (this practicing of recipes is part of what I think a course is good for, we were made to memorize 3-5 drinks every day and had a test the following morning, ending up with a selection of 77 cocktails in four weeks). If you're interested, Embury's ""The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks"" is a great starting point, perhaps in combination with Dale deGroff's ""Craft of the Cocktail"".   Also, particularly if weekends-only is the only option for you, you should be prepared to barback for the first few months, and do not be discontent about that - it's the road many a bartender has to take, and a great possibility for on-the-job learning. On slower nights, quiz your bartenders heavily on why they do such-and-such and how their recipes are and anything you wonder about, and on more busy nights be prepared to go balls-to-the-walls and keep everything ship-shape (never run out of ice, mixers or spirits, always try to keep one step ahead of your bartender, and never get in his/her way at any cost)."

When I wanted to switch locations, I had a tough time finding anyone to hire me. My competition was very high. The city has tonnes of bartenders looking for work and cocktail culture is really extensive thanks to Madmen (Don draper drinks) and food network. It gets intense and the talent pool can be high. If you're looking for a quick start with little hassle just for weekends, you should probably be looking for broken down semi crappy pubs near a university/college or something. Easy work for $45-$55 a night. You'll learn more there over time then taking classes."

I'm one of the few who is on the opposite end of the spectrum when it comes to bartending schools. I attended one and don't regret it. Not saying I'm the best but I feel that doing so gave me a very solid albeit basic foundation to build off of. Then again I've also worked in retail settings most of my life so I know what it's like being pulled every which way.

In order to become a decent bartender, all you really need is a decent personality but I would have never gotten into bartending without the confidence that bartending school gave me.  It gave me the drink knowledge, the knowledge of the state liquor control laws, and the basic skills to take that first step in getting behind a bar.  Most bartenders have NEVER been to bartending school and do quite well with on the job training, but for me, even after 30 + years behind the bar, I find that I still remember, and use, knowledge that I learned at Pittsburgh Bartending Institute.

The school thing was nice in that I could practice at really any time I wanted and being able to practice was key. Bartending does have a lot of details - which glass, what amounts, build vs blend etc, which alcohol can you substitute when out of something, which garnish, the different types of beer, wine, whiskey, keeping things clean/sanitary, dealing with shit customers, working the register, etc. Internalizing some drinks and standards was helpful so that on the job I can focus on speed and keeping customers happy."

Secondly, big city bars hire people with lots of experience for the most part (some dive bar exceptions but you don't wanna work there)  If you want to get a bartending gig ( which will definitely pay more than delivery) you'd have to commute to other areas.

bartenders,3b0m02,captainsong,5,Thu Jun 25 00:33:27 2015 UTC,"For a lager shandy, put the lemonade in first and either let it sit for a bit or swirl it round the glass to make it a bit flatter. This stops it from fizzing up too much when you pour in the beer.  Then just carefully pour the rest of the pint as you would with any other - at a 45 degree angle straightening at the end.  As for the ales vs. lager head, its mostly just practice and understanding how those different beers behave out of the tap.  If it looks like theres not enough head, straighten the glass a bit or move it up and down while pouring.  If you pour an entire pint with too little head, pour a tiny bit out and give it a short blast from the tap to fill it up, not pulling the tap all the way back usually works for me.  If you have too much head, shake the excess head off with a quick flick of the glass.  This is so you don't pour away too much beer, just the head.  Then just fill it up as normal."

For me when I do a shandy, like Blathwayt said, you put the Lemonade in first (What I do differently is if you're using a soda gun do it from a higher level so it fizzes up when it hits the bottom of the glass) then try and use a bar skimmer to give it a good swirl in the glass. 45 degree angle is what you're aiming for but if you have more of an angle it doesn't harm just make sure you're not spilling any of the lager out the glass. Ales are mostly a four pull system, you should be pulling it twice and letting it settle (I cash off the order whilst im waiting) and there's no need to rush here, get a nice smooth pull. Lager wise you are aiming for a 5% head, I say a good two-fingers width from the top of the glass, if you manage that great, if the customer asks for a top up, the foam is like 90% air anyway so theres no problem in giving it a quick top up. All the lines you have will react differently, it depends on how clean the lines are etc, its up to you to learn when you should be straightening up your glass and when learning when your head will develop. My main tip for you is, be confident. People will fuss and moan but you're doing your best and thats all that can be asked.  Any more questions just feel free to ask man, I been in the bartending game for a good while now."
bartenders,3b0m02,DavesOddysee,2,Thu Jun 25 02:28:49 2015 UTC,"Shandy: Make sure the lemonade is flat before you put in the beer.  Perfecting the pint: Honestly mate all taps are different so it's practise makes perfect here. No one here can tell you just keep at it!  Adding head: On lagers taps there should be a way to bring foam out of the tap to enlarge the head. It'll require you to push the tap forward instead of bringing it backwards, or I've seen taps you need to push it sideways before. Play around with the tap and figure it out. At my current place you have to pull it towards you just slightly.  Lessening head: Just keep pouring the beer, it'll spill over the sides but you'll remove some of the head.  Best of luck mate, keep at it. Any other questions just let me know."
bartenders,3b0m02,MoodyMelody,1 point,Thu Jun 25 10:32:50 2015 UTC,"Adding head:    If it's a habitually flat pour, you can also add the head first.  Instead of starting out at a 45 degree angle, drop the first half second directly into the bottom of the glass and then tilt to 45 degrees.  It roughs up the beer and ends up coming out with a nice head on it. This might not be a proper way but I've had kegs that just sucked occasionally and that's my fastest way of doing it."
bartenders,3b0m02,IONTOP,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:14:06 2015 UTC,Very true actually I've had to do this a fair amount
bartenders,3b0m02,MoodyMelody,1 point,Fri Jun 26 10:50:06 2015 UTC,You have to tilt the glass to control the head on pints. Every beer is different so you'll just have to experiment.

Grab two shaker tins and build my cocktails in each. Grab a scoop and ice them.  Pop on a 16oz metal mixing tin for both.  Hold them up and shake them like I'm beating off two giant black dicks in my face.  Set them down and take the mixing tins off.  Nest my two big tins together, nest one of my mixing tins on top. They act as their own strainer and I pour them right into the drink. (This only works well because we use large ice cubes)   Next time my gf is in I'll have her snap a quick video."

This will probably only save you time if the drinks got similar ingredients. However, they will be shaken at the same time, so both drinks should be more or less done simultaneously.

bartenders,3b0kpe,recombined,3,Thu Jun 25 00:42:18 2015 UTC,Shaking them both at once would save you time even if you poured them both individually.
bartenders,3b0kpe,AM_I_WRITE,-2,Thu Jun 25 00:45:08 2015 UTC,And break and pour them how quickly?  One is watering itself down every second you spend with the other one.  edit: Plus where do you set it down?  With a Boston set up its going to be top heavy... and if you knock it over well thats game.
bartenders,3b0kpe,recombined,4,Thu Jun 25 01:35:50 2015 UTC,"After shaking, the drinks should be at equilibrium. The melting of ice should decelerate considerably. While yes, there is still some further melting, but the difference is negligible.  My routine:   Shake set shaker A down, pop open shaker B in my other hand, and set down pick up A, pop open, strain strain B"
bartenders,3b0kpe,KaladinSyl,3,Thu Jun 25 03:56:03 2015 UTC,"This is the truth! If the drink is shaken properly (ten seconds), it's be so cold that the ice won't melt any more, or at least won't for the span of a few extra seconds while you pour another drink. A great reference with lots of good science regarding this is Liquid Intelligence by Dave Arnold."

But shaking two cocktails at once is not ""just flair.""  Every cocktail is different, and if you're double-straining a pisco sour after an egg-white dry shake, you're gonna do it with one tin at a time. But if you're making two vodka martinis, shake both at once. Not only does it impress customers, it saves time.  Do you work in a bar?"

bartenders,3azjqr,cheerios70,4,Wed Jun 24 19:35:47 2015 UTC,"Short answer: You need to be some amount of ""outgoing"".  Long Answer: You'll have to be some measure of extrovert at least some of the time, but it varies based on the venue and clientele. You don't need to spend 8 hours a day sucking everyone's dick trying to get them to like you, but some people might want that from you. The far more important thing is being able to read your customers, give them what they want, and communicate effectively. Super happy friendly can help you get a job, and help you succeed at certain venues, but there is also room in the world for cooler, more reserved types."
bartenders,3azjqr,beermanbarman,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:11:47 2015 UTC,Gotchya.. and i appreciate the input.
bartenders,3azjqr,Nomoreadviceanimals,5,Wed Jun 24 20:37:35 2015 UTC,"Depends almost entirely on the venue.  Nightclub?  Be a loud party animal.  Cocktail lounge?  Be an affable and charismatic host who knows when to take a step back.  Dive bar?  A take-no-shits but lovable asshole.  Fine dining restaurant?  A seen but not heard artisan with a knowing wink when a guest asks for a stiff drink.  A good bartender can be all of these things, but most have a particular area they're more comfortable with.  But, uh, seriously, you should probably get a job first before worrying about intangibles like this.  And i dont care what your personality is like, hard work trumps all and if you suck no amount of charisma is going to save you."
bartenders,3azjqr,NYGateKeeper,3,Thu Jun 25 08:33:44 2015 UTC,"No one comes to a bar as a prospective bartender with the perfect bartender personality. It takes time to master the I don't give a shit because I'm repressing whatever absolute bullshit I'm dealing with at the moment, facade that veteran bartenders have.  It takes years to practice.   If you're just starting out, the best face you can wear is a hardworking one. No one expects you to handle a 20 deep bar, know the ins and outs of certain liquors, or how to tell the super coked up fella it's time to go. You can't do what you don't know yet. What you can do is work hard; and if you think you're working hard, work harder. Bartenders will respect you immediately and do their best to teach you the rest.   Don't worry about having the best personality. Just work hard and the rest will follow."
bartenders,3azjqr,evokeddamnation,2,Thu Jun 25 13:54:10 2015 UTC,"It always helps to be calm and professional, even when you're very busy. In my opinion you can observe the best bartenders to have mastered this as an art. It gives you an automatic neutral ground with everyone you meet, and encourages the client to treat you with respect, or at the very least be somewhat polite. Over time if you aren't a complete ding dong,  hopefully you've begun to develop a rapport with your clients, but even if that doesn't really solidify at least you're calm, polite, and professional. Nobody is going to complain about that."
bartenders,3azjqr,Nomoreadviceanimals,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:47:33 2015 UTC,makes sense. No one can complain if you're doing nothing wrong
bartenders,3azjqr,infoundead,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:53:25 2015 UTC,"Can I add that there's a fine line between calm, polite, and professional and standoffish/arrogant?  I've known guys who insisted they were the former but almost always left guests intimidated or feeling like they weren't welcome.  It's important for newer guys to keep that in mind."
bartenders,3azjqr,honeyvanille,2,Thu Jun 25 08:38:49 2015 UTC,"From what I've found there isn't a silver bullet answer to this sadly. It depends on things like where you're working, the customer base (which can change from night to night in some places), and how the customer is acting. I work in a bar/club in the UK (though I'm a FL native) and most of the time am expected to look like I'm having as good as a time as the customers, even when it's packed. Smiling and being outgoing are job requirements where I work. However, things have changed on a dime before, depending on the crowd. If your bar doesn't have security you have to deal with the troublemakers. You also have to be able to be nice, but at the same time tell someone you can't serve them anymore because they're too drunk. It feels like a balancing act sometimes, but you get the hang of it eventually!"
bartenders,3awa4q,Malinkz,8,Wed Jun 24 00:37:43 2015 UTC,Well i worked in a casino for the past five years until march... you'll have people that just want to be left alone playing their machines. Then you'll have the talkers. Then the cheap mother fuckers paying for their drinks with nickels dimes and pennies because they lost all their money. Eventually you'll spot the regulars and gain them as your own as well. Its always nice when people think you're their lucky charm. Sometimes you make money sometimes you don't. In my experience the tip percentage is much lower than your sales compared to other bars. I would get my ass kicked selling 6 grand in a night and only make $500 compared to selling $1000 in anothet bar and making $300.

bartenders,3av3n2,AirAssault310,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:25:10 2015 UTC,"I worked for bdubs for about a year, after bartending in both corporate and privately owned places for 10 years, this is the only job I've ever quit with no notice.   My store was poorly managed (6 bar managers in 12 months and GMs/ADs didn't attempt to help). That said, I can't speak for other stores but I can shed light on my experience!   The well was always busy and corporate didn't allow free pours (we had to use jiggers for syrup and finest call mixers).   Servers would only run their own drinks and let others die in the well, then managers would ask us to top off dead beers or stir them with straws to give them head before they ran them.  Customers were fantastic. I loved my regulars and a lot of them still come to my new job. Coworkers were mostly good people. I got paid (and was encouraged) to talk smack and watch every game imaginable. Kitchen was clean, food/fruit prep was sanitary.   I did have one manager tell me that they didn't care that my wings were on 40 mins (regular occurrence in my kitchen--again can't speak for other locations). That manager told me that nobody came in for the food, they came in for the atmosphere so he didn't care if it took 10 or 40 minutes to hit the table.  I made WAY more money on the floor than I ever made behind the bar. The whole restaurant is set up to be stadium-like, so the big parties / heavy drinkers would go to high tops, since every seat had a good view of at least 4 separate tvs.  Bdubs was definitely an experience. In my case, not the best, but maybe it was just the location I worked in."
bartenders,3av3n2,Shesgotaloosescrew,2,Wed Jun 24 01:36:14 2015 UTC,I couldn't imagine hearing those ticket times come out of a manager's mouth and them not joking.  The bdubs I've been to are vanilla but you always know what you signed up for.  It's the place I go when I want to ask to watch a game (even if I'm the only person in the bar that wants to watch it) they'll put it on and make sure I can see it comfortably.  I appreciate that about them

bartenders,3asm2o,HorribleChortas,3,Tue Jun 23 06:58:10 2015 UTC,Yes except add a few drops of blue curaco to the baileys it'll float between the peach and baileys and the grenadine pulls it down. :)
bartenders,3asm2o,fortyninecents,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:11:20 2015 UTC,I use a barspoon or the backside of a nearbye clean utensil to layer it. I'm not steady handed enough to place the spout against the far angle of the shot glass plus I think it makes the technique look more smooth. The grenadine does pull the blue curacao in. Any other color recomendations for making these?

Off the top of my head I can't list a specific single malt that does this, but Sheep Dip (stupid name, kind of a cool backstory to the name though) is very tobacco forward blend that has solid price point.

Are you into sports? Do you like making cocktails? Do you have a vast knowledge of beer? Would you be more comfortable at a beer/shot type place shooting the shit with old guys?   Basically it all depends on what you are like, and how that could fit in to the type of environment you want to work in."

Relaxed and family-owned pub with good food, slews of regulars, and high volume nights. It's casual, fun, and good money.

bartenders,3as03w,LowercaseGuitarist,11,Tue Jun 23 01:11:58 2015 UTC,"What did you try ? Whisky is very diverse.   If you like Vanilla/caramel flavor, try a Bourbon, something spicier ? Try a Rye. If you prefer sweet wine, jammy fruits, etc try a sherry or port finished/matured scotch, if you enjoy strong and weird flavors (smokiness, dirt and phenols) try a peaty islay... If nothing works, try a classic good quality bourbon matured scotch like Benromach or Balblair...   There are thousands subtleties in taste and aroma but that's some easy things to spot in a whisky  Put some water until it's palatable for you. Take some time. And well, you'll see."
bartenders,3as03w,anotherbluemarlin,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:46:41 2015 UTC,It was a laphroaig 10 I tried. Taste was still in my mouth the next day (tried it on a camping trip).

bartenders,3as03w,anotherbluemarlin,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:25:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's probably why you hated it. Not everybody enjoy peat, it's a very strong and distinctive flavor... Some people enjoy the finest whisky but still hate peat. Try something gentler, sweeter, rounder, and nicer, for instance (on the relatively cheap and common side): Aberlour 12 (non chill filtered if possible), AnCnoc 12 or 16, Balvenie 12 Doublewood, Auchentoshan Three wood/12, Benromach 10 (a bit peaty), Dalwhinnie 15, Glen Garioch Founders reserve, Glen Elgin 12, Glendronach 12/15,  glenfarclas 12, glenmorangie 10/quinta ruban(port finished), highland park 12 (a bit peaty), some older glenlivet and glenfiddich ( i wouldn't recommend both their 12 yo...) or Macallan (way to expensive for what it is though)....   You could also try some Bourbons, i don't know it as well but you can't go wrong with the classics : Buffalo Trace, Rittenhouse, Four Roses Small Batch, Makers mark etc"
bartenders,3as03w,VancouverSpecial,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:44:12 2015 UTC,"That's a really intense peaty, smokey whiskey. Try something lighter like Glenmorangie to start to get a feel of it."
bartenders,3as03w,vanshnookenraggen,4,Tue Jun 23 19:30:43 2015 UTC,"Whisky can be an acquired taste for sure.  Since you have more Scotch at your bar I'd start there.  There are a lot of different types of Scotch depending on where they are from (Highland, Lowland, Speyside, Islay) and if they are blended or single malt.  I am far from an expert on Scotch (Bourbon is my jam) so what I'd do is see what you have and look up where they come from.  Taste them and note the differences.  Note the differences between single malt and blended.  As a rule of thumb I drink single malt with one rock (as others have said a small amount of water opens the whisky up and lets your tongue taste what's going on) and blended usually with club soda... but that is just how I prefer it.  Aging whisky longer usually cuts the burn and will make a smothers whisky.  This doesn't mean, though, that the oldest is best.  I've had plenty of 12 year or 15 year that were much better than an 18 year or older AND much more affordable.  That's the other thing, higher cost almost never means better.  Higher cost for whisky is just so rich douche bags can show off.  My favorite whiskys are cheap and strong and smooth as hell.  Eventually you will develop a palate for it even if it doesn't become your drink of choice."

bartenders,3as03w,ShannonM24,3,Tue Jun 23 03:24:20 2015 UTC,"I work in a bourbon bar in kentucky. Honestly the easiest way is by simply tasting around and getting a feel for it. When you might of been younger, it was about taking shots and getting drunk. I would recommend drinking everything neat then adding 2 or 3 cubes if the burn isn't for you. Taking a few sips at a time is much more bearable compared to shot after shot. You'll start to develop a real appreciation and flavor profile of what you like. People can tell when you're bullshitting them, so just be honest with what you taste. Usually telling someone you get notes of x,y, and z will help them to taste what you do. Happy tasting!"
bartenders,3as03w,MyEyes_qp,3,Tue Jun 23 02:31:14 2015 UTC,"Somebody will surely know better than me, but as a whiskey lover, I drink them on the ice.  When the whiskey gets cool and slightly watered down (I emphasize slightly), the flavors are more easily detectable without the harshness of the alcohol.  If you're trying to learn the flavor of the whiskey, you can't really mix it with anything without masking something.  So I suggest, one by one, drinking them on ice and noting what you like and don't like about them."
bartenders,3as03w,cake_for_breakfast76,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:28:38 2015 UTC,"I really got into whiskey in the last couple years. When you're really new to it, I found it helpful to read reviews of a whiskey before drinking it. This gives you an idea of the types of notes you should be looking for. One whiskey might have notes of apple or pear, and one may have notes of campfire or leather. After a while it's better to try without reading first, so you find tasting notes yourself. Hope this helps!"

It would hold secondary liquors, other than my speed rail. Campari, Suze, Etc.   There are never enough places to stash a trash can.

From my exp as a bartender at a club, 75% of the men were greasy as fudge. On Men's night the female bartenders would make two or three hundred. On ladies night the male bartenders might make 75.

People don't typically complain about $5 wells and $7-$12 cocktails. I imagine you have auto gratuity so that can work in your favor. Depending on the volume you may not be making more money in the long run VS. A high volume dive where you make whiskey coke all night. I am enjoying becoming a more specialized bar tender, making menus, and orders. I say go for it. I'm not sure what the question was, I'm enjoying a shifter. Let me know if there's anything else that concerns you."

One member has asked me to bartend for three parties for him in the past year and a half while he supplies everything and pays me a flat rate for working it

Make sure the label goes on the same place every time. Just like prepped items in the kitchen. Makes sure the staff is always grabbing the oldest keg first. This is a very simple method that works."
bartenders,3amrfo,z0n3,2,Sun Jun 21 20:20:38 2015 UTC,"My new shop has about 25 lines, plus a smaller patio system. Management definitely has a spreadsheet they track things on (dating isn't so much of an issue, cuz we move a lot of product), but they also post a sheet in the walk-in showing exactly what beers go on which line and what's waiting on deck to replace the last of something. That last part is key when you're moving kegs from the storage fridge to the main one and building the room to handle brunch thru 2am on Saturday."

We have a check in logbook that each manager notes date delivered and date kegged.  We send a LOT of stuff back.  We devote a certain percentage of taps to permanent beers and the rest to rotators.  If a certain beer doesn't get ordered at least once a month (less time if hoppy), it gets demoted from the permanent list.  In ordering beers for the rotators, the hardest part for me is limiting myself from buying all the kegs that spike my interest and reining it in when it comes time to order.  Don't sit on kegs unless they will definitely age well."

Along with that, plainly talk to the GM. Who knows? Maybe everyone else bailed out and the GM assumes you'll take the shift no matter what. Maybe it's time to convey to the GM that you absolutely care about the bar, but you need a day off once in a while."

I'm going to call them unpredictable because holidays that fall on a Sunday is pretty vague -- Are we talking MLK day here, or Christmas?  Either way, it's happening to OP.    I was going to say that I'd suggest seeing if a barback could train up to start taking on the shift as well - Seems like most (all?) barbacks have the intention of moving up, and it sounds like you have a good opening to get them some shifts for more experience, even though it is going to inconvenience you on those Sundays temporarily unless you can train them on other days.  I'll ignore the part about a bartender, because that's an incredibly obvious solution to the issue that I'm sure has been considered.    Sounds to me like you need to tell management you won't be taking these shifts anymore, or that you at least need plenty of verbal advanced notice, and if possible that you don't want them being mandatory but rather a ""Would you cover please?"" shift, since it sounds like the place operates on a set schedule."

From a high school that was a shitty excuse for public education. I was a pillar in my church and spent my freshmen year studying youth ministry in Chicago. Then I saw a bottle of Bombay Sapphire on a shelf in a storage room, at a part time job I had. Everything changed.   Alcohol has taught me history, math, economics, social skills, discipline, respect, and so much more.   In my mind I traded in my tiny church pulpit for a much bigger one. I still get to preach, just about things I'm more passionate about. And I still get to be filled with the spirit when I so choose.   I've worked in bars, breweries, wineries, and distilleries. I prefer the bar. It's all encompassing and pays better. It allows me to do everything else I want to do in life. Travel, love, eat well, drink better, and cultivate friendships. So many people work a job they hate to afford what they love. I work a job I love that allows me to enjoy everything else that much more.   Anytime somebody asks me why I bartend or what my long con is, I ask them the same. 90% of the time we have the same answers and I have a better quality of life paired with a higher tax bracket at the end of the year."

Really tough. I have a mortgage, car payment, etc, etc. Talking with my s.o., she understands and I am just going to have to pay less of my fair share for a while.  But! When I hit sales... I will be making 50-70k in my market. So, worth it? Yes.  I will get to be around for weddings and other family things instead of closing the bar, and I will be able to have a social life again, but still working in the industry.   I say pull the trigger if you're thinking about it. I am eating healthier, not drinking (as much), and am able to see friends. I still get to do tastings, talk about wine/beer/liquor, and I am not in an office. It will pay off in the long run- which is what I think you are getting at.  Edit- I should also mention my old place of employment still lets me bartend on weekends. Which really helps with the bills, for now.

bartenders,3af9qo,dmbohn,5,Fri Jun 19 23:17:37 2015 UTC,"There are two avenues for liquor sales and distribution: on-premise (meaning you can consume alcohol on premise, ie: restaurants) and off-premise (buying from a grocery or liquor store and bringing it home). Merchandising is setting up displays, putting away orders to the shelf, and maintaining relationships in the store when the salesperson is not present. So, purely off-premise.

Trust me, speed will come with time."
bartenders,3a7kjr,kunstlich,3,Thu Jun 18 00:08:15 2015 UTC,Technique/accuracy first. Speed follows. Practice pouring/stirring/shaking at home.
bartenders,3a7kjr,elus,3,Wed Jun 17 21:41:07 2015 UTC,"Definitely accuracy. I know it's enshrined somewhere on this sub as ""Slow is Smooth, Smooth is Fast"".  Learn how to do things correctly, and over time you will get faster. It can be agony feeling like you have to go faster to keep up, but it's far more time consuming to be a fuck-up. It doesn't matter if you can make an old fashioned in 10 seconds if you screw it up and have make it again. Keep your composure, stay focused, and do things the right way, and everything will fall into place over time."

bartenders,3a7kjr,Mitch_from_Boston,3,Thu Jun 18 02:18:35 2015 UTC,"A general rule in business is mistakes cost three times over: the wasted first effort, discovering/undoing/discarding the mistake, and then the redo.  So if it takes twice as long to get it right the first time, it's saving overall."
bartenders,3a7kjr,RJFerret,2,Thu Jun 18 06:18:58 2015 UTC,"Like everyone's saying in this thread; slow is smooth, smooth is fast. Nothing wastes time like having to listen to a guest's complaints and having to remake their drink.  Sane, realistic people don't go out to the bar on a busy night and expect their Ramos Fizz in front of them 45 seconds after they order. If the bar is packed, you might have to wait a few minutes for your drink. It's that simple.  The most important thing to remember is that, as a bartender, you're always on display. If you rush things, not only will your cocktail quality diminish, but you'll look inept and your guests' experience will suffer as well. Take your time, be professional and make great drinks. Everything else will fall into place."
bartenders,3a7kjr,ElcidBarrett,2,Thu Jun 18 09:37:32 2015 UTC,"Accuracy. And studying common recipes will significantly improve your speed. I used to remember recipes by visualizing where the bottles I would need are in the bar, and eventually muscle memory, as opposed to real memory, took over when someone would order a drink. does that even make sense?? Oh well, I know what I'm talking about."

Let the Guiness cascade and the head to form for at least a minute (work on other drinks or collect payment while this is happening. Stout drinkers understand). Then finish the beer holding the glass straight up and closer to the spout. The head should be firm and you can make a design in it if you want to.  If the Guiness is too foamy, hold the glass closer to the spout, and at a 45 degree angle. Let cascade and settle, then finish it."
bartenders,3a5g71,VancouverSpecial,3,Wed Jun 17 23:12:40 2015 UTC,"Guinness: A two-step pour. First, glass at 45 degrees close under the nozzle, pull the tap forward, fill about 2/3 (around the top of the harp on the guinness glass). This is the first thing you do in the whole round, then leave it to settle before coming back at the end to finish the guinness last. Second, glass vertical close under the nozzle, push the tap backward and top up. Draw things in the head if you like, but only if you actually can. Nobody likes random squiggles in the top of their pint.  Cask ales: (with a sparkler on the swan neck) Glass vertical under the swan neck with the nozzle touching the bottom of the glass. Pull three full, smooth pours with the handle and leave the beer to settle for a minute. Once it's settled and the cloudiness is gone, put the glass back under, same as before, and finish off the pint with slow, steady half-pours. Let it settle again while you take payment or whatever, then hand it over once it's cleared properly.  Cask ale: (without a sparkler) Just put the glass on the drip tray and pull the whole pint down with full, smooth pours. Some people like their cask ale flat(ish). You want to pour fast enough to get some head on there, but not so fast you get splashback out of the glass.  Lager and cream/smoothflow keg beers: Start at 45 degrees and after about 2/3 of the pint slowly bring the glass around to vertical. Glass closer to the nozzle for less head, further away for more head."

bartenders,3a4q8f,Loud_Snort,3,Wed Jun 17 16:35:35 2015 UTC,"Props for Old Granddad 100. I don't understand why OGD has a reputation as a bottom shelf bourbon; the hundred proof is a surprisingly well rounded whiskey for the price point.  I've always thought New Amsterdam tastes like gasoline, personally. If I were building a home bar, I'd stock Tito's any day of the week. It's certainly not AS cheap, but Goose/Ketel quality vodka for the same price as Absolut is a hell of a deal."
bartenders,3a4q8f,ElcidBarrett,3,Thu Jun 18 09:10:32 2015 UTC,I only chose New Amsterdam because of the cost. It's cheap but it's way better than Popov or Krista. It's vodka and it's more than likely going to be mixed. For a vodka martini Tito's all the way.   And yes Grandad gets a bad wrap. The 100 proof is awesome in my opinion.
bartenders,3a4q8f,Loud_Snort,3,Thu Jun 18 09:19:20 2015 UTC,It really comes down to what you prefer. Try buying a couple airplane bottle a week and making test cocktails. Find what you like and buy that.

White rum: Havana Club 3yr or El Dorado 3yr  Spiced: Sailor Jerry  Aged: El Dorado 5yr or 8yr/Havana Club Especial or 7yr  Bourbon: Woodford Reserve  Rye: Rittenhouse  Sweet Vermouth: Carpano is you want something on the pricier end (find the 375ml bottles)  Dry Vermouth: I really like Dolin (again grab the 375ml if possible
bartenders,3a4q8f,MoodyMelody,3,Wed Jun 17 17:40:31 2015 UTC,"Lets just run them down (all subjective BTW): Vodka: Titos is by far the best combination of quality and price  Gin: Tanq is good enough for most cocktails, Hendricks or Sapphire if you want to go pricier  White Rum: mostly indistinguishable past Bacardi superior  Spiced Rum: here you wanna go something nicer like Kracken  Tequila: 1800 silver is good enough for mixing. Patron is overrated. If you want something nicer, go with Don Julio or Tres Agaves or Milagro or even Diabolito, but many people believe these are too high quality tequilas to mix  Bourbon Whiskey: varies wildly by taste but I like to go with Bullet, Woodford Reserve, or Blantons  Rye Whiskey: Bullet all the way  Canadian Whiskey: Crown Royal is very solid and not too expensive  Scotch Whiskey: varies even more wildly by taste but my favorite is the Macallan 12 year  Triple Sec: really doesn't matter that much but if you want a call liqueur go with Cointreau or Marnier  Peach Schnapps: really really doesn't matter just buy some Peachtree  White/Red Vermouth (Dry/Sweet): Martini & Rossi brand is industry standard for a reason, don't overthink it  Again, these are my opinions formed from my tastes and the tastes of my customers, so YMMV"

bartenders,3a4q8f,Junkbot,5,Wed Jun 17 12:13:08 2015 UTC,Footrub pretty much nailed it. I'd say buy some Angostura butters as well. But do yourself a favor get a bottle of Macallan 12 as well. Give guests something to sip on.

bartenders,3a4q8f,Cheezburger,5,Wed Jun 17 12:50:38 2015 UTC,"I would argue...  Gin: Beefeater (for more....ginny drinks, haha. Hendricks and Sapphire I would call both softer gins) There are a ton of great brands I don't know about, though.   Spiced Rum: Appleton...I would call Kraken a black rum.  Tequila: Milagro is ok but I'd add in Espolon   Bourbon: Cheapest bottle would be evan williams (gets a bad rap but is actually pretty good, specially for mixing) I wouldn'y go higher than anything over $30. You start to get into territory of ""WHY, IT SHOULD BE NEAT!"". So buffalo trace, eagle rare, Four roses, Elijah Craig...the list goes on. I like higher proof bourbons but more often substitute rye for bourbon when mixing.  Rye: Rittenhouse  Scotch: Again, tough due to neat sipping...but I say Famous Grouse or Monkey Shoulder for mixing.  Triple sec: I actually like Pierre Ferrand Dry Curaçao.   Vermouths: For red Punt e mes or carpano antica  This isn't top shelf by any means...but I don't think the dollar carries further than this. In my own mind, this is the most efficient bar at home."
bartenders,3a4q8f,Buttock,3,Wed Jun 17 15:45:04 2015 UTC,"Would argue that for spiced rum to have something like Captain or Sailor as well as a black rum (Kracken, or Gosling's as my tastes prefer)."

bartenders,3a4q8f,Dmbdestroyer,2,Wed Jun 17 15:47:04 2015 UTC,"For Irish whiskey I would recommend Tullamore Dew or Jameson.  I'm not very sure for White rum, but Appleton is decent for Jamaican drinks with its grapefruit aftertaste and Cane is perfect for sweet cocktails with its sugary taste."

For Irish Whiskey (which you should mostly be drinking straight) I recommend Jameson or Bushmills"

The diminishing returns thing is spot on when it comes to mixed drinks.   You can make mixers and freeze some of them for later use or use as ice cubes. Good ice is also key to what you're making. Sort of like cooking, you can take an inexpensive cut and make it awesome with the right preparation.  Fresh is best."
bartenders,3a4vxt,GravityRides,8,Wed Jun 17 06:30:27 2015 UTC,"Managers should definitely not be receiving a tip out for being MOD. If they cover a bar shift, they're going above/beyond their own job and deserve the tips they earned that shift"
bartenders,3a4vxt,Footrub2completion,5,Wed Jun 17 07:45:11 2015 UTC,"So I'm a ""slash"" at my current bar.  For those that don't know, a slash is a bartender who also manages.  It's the worst possible scenario to be in because (and this may or may not be unique to my bar) I only make tips when I'm clocked in as a bartender.  That means I make two different hourly wages and I only get tips when I'm clocked in as a bartender, even though as a manager I am still making drinks.  So If I'm not working solo, I'm going broke.  Does this make any sense at all?  I'm still trying to figure out how I am going broke as a bartender.  It makes sense not to tip a manager because most of the time the manager does nothing and just waits around for a problem to arise.  When a bartender gets in the weeds and the manager decides to lend a hand he should not accept tips.  I wanted to go into management for the health and dental benefits but in the long run it's been a nightmare trying to make any money.  Last week I made $236 in tips for the entire week because I was clocked in as manager half the time.  Managers should never accept tips because they have a higher hourly wage or salary, but when I'm clocking those manager hours my paychecks are taxed of the bartender tips.  I'm not even breaking even, I'm going broke.  If anyone is wondering wether they should go management from bartending DON'T DO IT.  After having done this for four months I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
bartenders,3a4vxt,BobDylanBlues,2,Wed Jun 17 08:16:14 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure you're getting screwed. As a manager do you make above minimum wage? Is it part of the description of your role to make drinks and serve customers? Are you supposed to only be overseeing the other bartenders, but are jumping in to help them out?  I'd find a labor attorney to ask about it."
bartenders,3a4vxt,KnightsFan,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:29:07 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I'm getting royally screwed.  As a matter of fact I'm quitting today.  I had a job offer two days ago from another establishment and I interviewed for 2 more a day ago so I'm hoping to hear back from all of them.  At the current hell-gig I make $2 above minimum wage, which is still hardly a livable wage.  They have me supervise all other tenders and they are so tight with the hours that when it's closing time they send the other bartenders home and have me clean the bar.  It's the worst job I've ever had.  On top of that when I'm done cleaning the bar, they ask me to count all drawers and do the bank deposit which takes up a good hour and a half and they want me out of the building before I hit 6 hours.  It's insane.  Last week I made less than I did in my previous post.  $185 for the whole week.  Check taxed of all tips.  I'm broke.  Anyways I'm turning in my keys in a few hours."

bartenders,3a4vxt,BobDylanBlues,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:55:13 2015 UTC,"It depends on your state's law...not sure about Texas. I've been told that in California it's illegal for employees exempt from overtime to receive tips. But that doesn't mean it doesn't happen or that there aren't legal ways around it.  The last time I was a bartender/manager I wasn't paid hourly nor salary. I was given a 'day rate' and was not exempt from overtime. This made it completely legal for me to receive tips and still hold the title of manager. So I'd have 2 administrative days and 3 bartending days a week. No matter which position I was working, I was making the same day rate. The one thing I was absolutely not allowed to have any involvement in was scheduling. That's where it gets shady...'pouring managers' that have their hands in the schedule is a recipe for disaster. IMO. That's how you really fuck with someone's money, the scheduling of shifts."
bartenders,3a4vxt,4footgiant,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:37:29 2015 UTC,"Our bar pools tips, which people on salary (and those who make the schedule) cannot be part of. When managers bar tend on weekends they can keep any tips given directly to them, but otherwise have to put tips into the pool bucket. So if you go up and order a beer from them and pay cash or don't open a tab they get that tip. If you open a tab they no longer get the tip.  So basically there is no ""sharing"" tips with managers. They get what is given to them and that's it. Even less, since there are often times on busy nights when someone leaves a cash tip and the manager is already on to helping the next person, which means there's a chance they won't even get the tip b/c either another bar tender will just take it (not maliciously) or they won't know it was theirs and put it in our bucket."
bartenders,3a4vxt,jewunit,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:19:37 2015 UTC,Why would a manager even bother to bartend? That's a pretty lame system.
bartenders,3a4vxt,AnneFrankenstein,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:03:08 2015 UTC,"No one would ever AGM because they don't make enough on salary alone. Definitely not the greatest, but if it was done better it wouldn't be that big of a deal.   If you're asking why they would bother to bartend as in it would be a waste for them because they don't make money you are mistaken. It's a high volume bar, they make plenty. Non-managers are the people who take the hit; that's hundreds of dollars a night taken out of the tip pool."

Trader vic's Mai Tai tends to be the standard, and it originally used a single JWray 17 year rum as the base, blended w/ orgeat, curacao, and lime juice. These days, it's much more common to use a blend of aged Jamaican and French rums to replicate the flavor of the JWray 17, which is no longer produced.  http://postprohibition.com/recipes/trader-vics-mai-tai/"

I haven't completely quit drinking, so take this only for what it's worth, but after years of indulging, I gave up drinking behind the bar and haven't looked back. Because there are many, many regulars that want to drink with you, here's what has worked for me - (1) I tell everyone I'm driving (just in my experience, if I tell people I'm not drinking, I quit drinking, etc. - there's just a long list of questions that I usually don't have time to answer), and (2) I drink a TON of water. Not sure exactly why, but it severely cuts down on my cravings. Good luck!"

bartenders,39ybny,annikinskh,4,Tue Jun 16 16:08:01 2015 UTC,"I've known a few bartenders that didn't drink, maybe 2 that were actually sober (no recreational drugs). It requires that you be okay being 'odd' and saying no constantly and happily."
bartenders,39ybny,lunavale,3,Mon Jun 15 22:32:39 2015 UTC,"Had a sober bartender co-worker. He was sober for over 15 years when we worked together. Dude was just that strong in his program. He didn't taste his drinks, and trusted that his measurements were correct. He was charming and popular and brought in a lot of cash for the bar and a lot of tips for the team. If someone wanted to buy him a drink he responded by saying ""I don't drink on the job,"" or simply, ""I don't drink."" People were surprised, but it ended up adding to his charm. (Not sure if it's relevant, but he was just a normal looking guy with a friendly smile)."
bartenders,39ybny,druss5000,3,Tue Jun 16 04:37:24 2015 UTC,"Almost five years sober here (August, can't believe it!) and bartender for 15. When I finally got sick enough to realize my drinking days were over, I made a conscious choice to stay in the business. I figured that alcohol had controlled me for so long, that it was my turn to be in control. I had just gotten a fantastic job and I didn't want to try to stay sober, change careers and job hunt. I felt the stress would threaten my sobriety. I did tell my co workers and they were all immensely supportive.  I took a small step out of the bar world and got a nine to five job and THAT shit made me want to drink. So I'm back now and it's still fine.  I've had tons of eye opening talks with customers and have helped several co workers and friends find help for their own drinking. I would say this... If you relapse because of work then leave and don't look back. Ever.  Your health wins."
bartenders,39ybny,apalehorse,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:52:26 2015 UTC,Solid advice!  And congrats on almost 5 years!  That's amazing!
bartenders,39ybny,PuckDaFackers,3,Tue Jun 16 16:15:33 2015 UTC,"Ex-bartender here. I have never really drunk much. Would hardly have drinks after work. Would taste my cocktails though. Found that I was always the guy with money a few days before pay was due. Never came into work saying ""I am never going to drink again"" then that weekend getting absolutely plastered. I think the UK scene is a bit different to USA. Still had great fun and wouldn't change my experience (about 6 years in London). On the advice front: Have some sort of non-alcoholic drink you have throughout the shift. As per previous advice have a reasonable excuse for not accepting a drink. Get ready to waking up at a reasonable hour and feeling like you can face the day without having to deal with a hangover."
bartenders,39ybny,PuckDaFackers,5,Tue Jun 16 06:56:35 2015 UTC,I stumbled on your post and it looks like we live in the same area...  Congratulations on your sobriety. Addiction is a tough thing to shake and you've really accomplished something important for yourself.  If your sobriety is important to you then you should think about changing your career.  Being sober and going to parties or meals where alcohol is served is difficult. It will be that much more difficult for you to be constantly surrounded by temptation.  If you have to stay then try to develop a good relationship with the owner/manager and consider confiding in them about your addiction.  Knowing that you have people watching you will make it harder to slip.  But you should really think about trying something new.  You're a new person now (or maybe the person you were before things went downhill). Maybe that means that you deserve a new career too.
bartenders,39ybny,panasonicboom,3,Mon Jun 15 20:46:37 2015 UTC,I won't speak for looking for a new career but I agree 100% with being open about your recovery/former addiction. I have a coworker who is a recovering/recovered alcoholic and he's said that being open with everyone about it is the best way to keep himself in check. He still even straw tests cocktails and stuff to check for balance and can still withhold from having an actual drink. Maybe he's got remarkable self-restraint or something but working as a bartender when you're sober is doable.
bartenders,39ybny,panasonicboom,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:20:51 2015 UTC,I don't think I will ever be comfortable taste testing.  But I am okay being upfront about my recovery.
bartenders,39ybny,VancouverSpecial,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:12:38 2015 UTC,Yeah its not necessary and you can always ask a coworker to do it for you but he seems to manage fine.
bartenders,39ybny,kkseacret,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:33:30 2015 UTC,"Oh, awesome!  And, thanks!  I actually started getting sober while I was still behind the bar, it didn't work out (I didn't stay sober for other reasons and the bar itself was a terrible environment, sober or drinking, so I decided to quit).  I just bartend on the side for extra cash and have another career.  I found a bartending gig that would be more doing events than working at a normal bar, which I think would be a lot easier for me.  I feel pretty stable in my sobriety now and wouldn't hesitate to leave if I felt my sobriety was at risk.  I really just want to prepare myself, because I do enjoy bartending and the time I did it while sober was actually a lot better than when I was doing it shitfaced."
bartenders,39ybny,rhetoricjams,2,Tue Jun 16 16:11:54 2015 UTC,"Sober bartender here.  I don't drink whatsoever (dat alcoholism) and I find for me, at work, it's just easier to say--if someone is trying to buy me a drink--""Thanks, but I'm not drinking today.""  Guess it puts me in that one-day-at-a-time mind frame and doesn't sounds too... hmm... final?  About drinking.  Because I worry that it can be a buzzkill to tell customers I'm an alcoholic and can never ever drink although if they ask right out, I'm always honest about it.  I just try to keep it vague, as in, hi, not drinking today but thank you for asking, I'd be happy yo chug my red bull with ya.  I drink a loooooot of lemon water and a redbull-grenadine-soda water on the rocks cocktail that I constantly nurse.  Helps me feel like I'm at least socially drinking, I guess.  I do still straw-test drinks and new liquors when necessary.  The hardest times are probably when it's very slow or when I'm feeling insecure, but at this point it's been a long enough time that I tell myself how ridiculous it would be to screw it up just because I'm bored or not feeling particularly hot/witty that day."

I can teach any monkey how to mix a rum and coke or pour a beer but teaching hard work, ultra fast service, and an ability to make it look easy is strictly something you either have our you don't.  It's up to you to decide if you want to be a lazy pathetic nervous bartender, or if you will display pressure under fire and be one of the good ones to work with... Breath, slow is smooth and smooth is fast, is only drinks, hustle, hustle, hustle."

bartenders,39zng4,Soularbowl,2,Tue Jun 16 15:07:02 2015 UTC,"I'd try and get a beer list and see what is going to be a constant and what isn't. Learn the permanent beers so you can know what to pour for someone when you're short on time. Study the rest and upsell. Find out if your keg system is a FOB or not, then google how to change out kegs and flush lines. Be aware of your surroundings, being behind the bar is like trying to juggle glassware while cattle stampedes all around you. Learn to not be in the way. Bartenders are temperamental, they see themselves as the star of the show. Learn your coworkers personalities and how to work with their egos and how to make that entertainment for your patrons. In the same vein, respect your barbacks and support staff. Have high standards but don't act like you're above them. Don't get ape faced because it's busy, keep cool and keep socializing. With customers, with co-workers, with management. Start leaning spirits, cocktail families, and what drinks are popular in your area. If you get a ticket with 3 coctails and 4 beers lay out three tins for the cocktails. Build up all three at the same time from your well. Spirit, juice, modifier, garnish. Every. Single. Time. The Same. Look around and try to get a barback to pour for you, or know exactly what taps you need to hit when your done mixing the cocktails. Every second of melted ice counts when pouring. I can keep going, but there is honestly so much information to learn about working at a bar you'll either fall in love or give up. Cicerone and Bar Smarts are great courses to take if you get into it. PM me any questions if you'd like."

bartenders,39v26k,Tasty_asian,9,Mon Jun 15 01:06:58 2015 UTC,"Like everyone else is saying, pretty much no one is ever going to say something to their boss if they don't tip. But, as an owner you gain a tremendous amount of respect from your staff if you at least tip them like any other customer would. You're already saving yourself a lot of money by drinking at your own establishment instead of other places. At least tipping on a rough estimate of what you spent just says to your employees ""I appreciate you, the work you do, and the service you just provided me."""
bartenders,39v26k,1knightstands,5,Mon Jun 15 04:28:55 2015 UTC,"The owners of the restraunt I work at always tip very well for both drinks and dining. If I was their server I would be very upset if they didn't tip, but as a bartender I don't mind either way."
bartenders,39v26k,captainsaltyballs,3,Mon Jun 15 01:42:46 2015 UTC,"I work in an oyster bar and my owners come in about 3 times a week. They never tip and they give away booze to regulars. Seeing how they own the place i can not get mad about them drinking the booze that they own but it does get annoying when my customers spend less because the owner is giving it to them. They probably give away about 60$ in booze. I guess it could be worse? Either way i keep my mouth shut,i am just glad to have a  job."
bartenders,39v26k,Poostar33,2,Mon Jun 15 01:23:26 2015 UTC,"Damn I wish my boss did this... He regularly racks up hundred dollar tabs (obviously comped to 0) and only once in two years as his head bartender/bar manager has he ever given me any money at all. What's worse, he has his friends come in and I am told to comp them as well.. And maybe 1 out of 10 times do they ever tip me."
bartenders,39v26k,Pestilence_XIV,2,Mon Jun 15 02:47:38 2015 UTC,That's shitty. If I get comped a drink I tip at least half its sticker price. At least.

But he's a fantastic boss, and honestly I wouldn't mind either way if he tipped or not (which I guess goes to show you how much I like him) But the fact that he takes care of us in the bar, it engenders so much good will that it's priceless."

I like it overall, since it can be a cause of resentment if someone does not tip enough.   The owner more than makes up for it by jumping on at busy times, and 90% of the time not taking any tips for himself."

In the first case, you tell yourself, hey it's our job to collect ids. I'm the keeper of the booze yall want, you're going to play by my rules or get out of my house. If you have a problem, you're gone.   In the second, you blame the owner. ""Hey yall, I hate to bust balls here, but the owner is riding me about ids these days."" Or, ""the cops have been stinging other bars in the area lately, you all are helping me out.""  You can stick to one or the other, or pick a method depending on the particular group. But no matter what, fuck anyone who gets aggro with you man. Get out my bar."

bartenders,39uk51,divebarprincess,9,Sun Jun 14 23:02:42 2015 UTC,"I have to do this at my bar, but I'm all alone. No bouncer, no manager, nobody. So my approach is to be very firm, and if people get aggressive I try to smile and calm the situation. If they are still being dicks, I tell them to get the fuck out and start walking around the bar. I've been very scared before, especially with groups of 3+ dudes. I just try not to seem scared."
bartenders,39uk51,JohnEKaye,15,Sun Jun 14 22:40:16 2015 UTC,"While I applaud your courage in a tight spot, that seems like a pretty dangerous style of escalation.   One stop-off between 'being dicks' and 'coming around the bar' is one my first bartender taught me: loud announcement- ""Ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry but I cannot serve any more drinks at this time, due to the presence of these people[obstinate fuckwits with no ID].""   This does a few things: It calls them out in a non-threatening manner and makes them the center of attention, which people don't usually want to be when they're acting like assholes. It also makes clear that you view getting them out as more important than making money or keeping people happy at that moment. Lastly, unless it's a huge crew or a very lonely bar, it reverses the dynamics- it's not them outnumbering you, but them having to square off against an entire bar's worth of people (even if it's only psychological)."

bartenders,39uk51,IONTOP,3,Mon Jun 15 01:59:24 2015 UTC,"It is a myth that you have to have an ID to get alcohol but it usually is a policy of a bar in order to avoid getting busted by stings. I usually let expired ID's go if the person is clearly of age, especially if they are with a large group of people who will just leave and go somewhere else. You will only get busted if they are underage and they show you their real ID that says they are underage.   Edit- apparently states differ in this. I'm in Georgia so your state may have different laws."

They plainly stared that the only that the only requirement to buy booze was was to be of age. No form of identification is necessary, but it is up to the seller to determine how old the purchaser is. If somebody is obviously of age, I dont even ask for an I.D. If they don't have one handy. ( Meaning obviously over 50+) I only press the issue if there is any possibility that they could actually be underage."

He could have just been having a bad day and wanted to show you how much he appreciates you the only way he thinks he knows how: with money.  I used to bartend at a place with some super rich regulars and you could tell that a life of disposable income molded them into thinking they needed to buy friends. A lot of them were super cool people that if you saw them on the street you would never guess they were worth millions.  I loved the money of course but I took it upon myself to always show them that I appreciated them outside of their money by buying them rounds. I even became friends with a few outside of work and I'd never let them buy me more then one or two rounds. One was an avid soccer player and fan so I'd go to matches with him and I always bought my own ticket just to show ""dude, I'm not just your bartender, we're friends and I'm just glad to be here having fun with a friend.""

She was a nurse and he was a bit of a rich drunk. Both of them the nicest and sweetest people you could know.  She happened to live behind the bar and most nights they would walk back to her place. Well one night both of them get pretty drunk pay their tab and off they go. Nothing unusual about it. She comes in early the next day and something just seems off. I happened to be working the day shift and ask her whats wrong. Turns out he died in his sleep the night before in her living room watching TV after she had gone to sleep.  The next week or so she would come in with baked goods or food she cooked and would give it to the person working as a kind of thank you because we all felt for her and did all we could to help her.

At the time our mayor was the longest serving mayor of any town in the country.  He was a regular and everyone knew and loved the guy.  He was in his late eighties when he met, at the restaurant, a lovely lady, 20 years younger, who was also a regular.  They became a couple who would always meet at the restaurant for diner.  After a few years she started picking him up and driving because of his lessened mobility. When he was 94 they came in for dinner one night, he, as always in a suit and, as always, having his two CC on the rocks with dinner.  She drove him home to his apartment.  The next day, when he didn't answer her phone call, she drove to his house but no one answered.  She called the Chief of Police and they forced his door open.  He was sitting on his couch, still in his suit from the night before.  The coroner said he just passed from natural causes.  Sure hope I can go out like that!!

If a few people are your friends then by all means continue talking to them but tell them that you don't want to hear about what so and so says about you. If they're your friend they'll respect that and if they insist on telling you anyway they're just as bad as anyone else and they probably talk shit about you behind your back too."

Learn to alter your shaking style. Tendinitis is a harsh mistress.  Work clean and become a fervent and evangelical member of the Church of Mise en Place. Lift with your knees, know your limits, and ask for help.  Drink less alcohol and more water than you think you need.  Full hands in, full hands out. If you cover a lot of square footage in a shift you should know what you need from the kitchen when you schlep your ass back there.  There's always something to be done. Know and execute what you can during downtime that you shouldn't be doing eye-high in the weeds; e.g., knife work. Speaking of knife work: own your own and learn their proper use and care. A sharp knife is a safe knife, and in many kitchens experienced staffers can offer you advice regarding knife skills. Your garnishes will look better and take less time, especially if you're routinely gashing yourself owing to poor technique. A bleeding bartender is not exactly caring for her guests.  Speaking of owning your own barware, do. Being comfortable in your environment is important for your physical and mental health, and using tools you're comfortable and familiar with provides rhythm and regularity to an inherently chaotic profession. Figure out what you need, explore your options, and invest in at least barspoons,  strainers, a y-peeler, a decent paring knife, and maybe nice strainers.  Embrace your profession and learn as much as you can about what you do. Learn classics and standards. Have opinions. Taste what you pour as much as you can. You are living a life, after all, and you spend a lot of it at work.  Care for others and care for yourself, more than anything else. Does that drunken guest who hasn't even been served at your bar need help getting an Uber? Know how to tactfully cut him off and make sure he gets home safe. Be the bartender your guests need by being yourself. Be happy with who you are and where you are or work to change what isn't working.  tl;dr, I know."

bartenders,39hhhf,beermanbarman,10,Thu Jun 11 20:31:19 2015 UTC,"Questions:  1) What kind of place is this? (Restaurant? Hotel Bar? Cocktail Lounge? Club?)  2) What's your clientele like? (College kids? Yuppies? Blue Collar? Foodies?)  3) What do you mean by house-infused citrus juice?  It's hard to evaluate a list without knowing the audience. I can see this being a good list for a place that is young drinker's first cocktail bar: Has some grown-up classics for people to cut their teeth on, but also some flavored vodka drinks for the less adventurous.   Time for feedback! Please keep in mind, I'm not trying to be a dick, just telling you what I would do without really knowing much context.  1) I'm pretty sure The Hef is not a classic cocktail. Unless it's a house favorite at this particular bar?   2) Your classics side is pretty solid. I would maybe make some cuts or replacements so you can include a drink for every major spirit. Perhaps swap out Martini and Old Fashioned for saaay Daiquiri and Paloma? Depends on your guests and what your intentions are. If it's a crowd that'll order martinis and old fashioneds  without needing to be prompted by the menu, swap it out for something they hadn't thought of. If you're trying to introduce less experienced drinkers to these things, leave 'em be.  3) Sangria is a good idea, especially if you serve wine. It'll allows you to put good use to bottles that have been opened and are getting old. The downer is that to make proper sangria, you'll have to let the fruit sit in there at least overnight, putting you under threat of running out at a bad time. Your parenthetical about fruit I would just change to say (using fruits in season). It lets guests know that it might change day to day, and it'll get them excited to try it because it's using fresh seasonal fruit.And you can fudge that a little bit too. I'm not asking you to go to the farmer's market everyday, but if it's strawberry season, order strawberries, shouldn't be hard to find.  4) The other half of the list I'm less positive on, and I apologize if I come off too harsh. These lists look like they come from two different bars. Half of those 12 drinks have flavored vodka. A customer alternating between the two lists might get whiplash. These originals are an enormous thematic departure from your classics. In my mind, it would seem that any given guest is only going to be happy ordering from one menu or the other, but only some of them are going to know that. You might get a lot of Negronis sent back, or worse, you won't hear about it and they'll think you made them a terrible drink. Furthermore, I think the people who would enjoy these respective lists are very different. Is the bar pulling in that wide of a crowd? Not that it's impossible, but I'm not sure what this place is like.  So, here's what I would do if I were you:  1) Cut back on as much flavored vodka as your customers will let you get away with. Yes, some of them are good, but even more of them suck. If you're trying to be a serious cocktail bar, having a wall of flavored vodkas sends a different message to your customers. Yes, it's a bit elitist, but serious cocktail drinkers aren't going to treat you seriously. It doesn't matter if they're wrong, if you send the wrong message you might not get the chance to prove yourself. Try to replace all those fruit flavors with liqueurs. You already have cassis, St. Germain and so on, so you're moving in the right direction. One of the advantages here is that you can add those flavors without adding a bunch of alcohol to a drink. Also make sure you're picking up necessary liqueurs for classics: Chartreuse, Maraschino, Benedictine, etc.  2) You've got 24 cocktails on this menu, which is a lot. Some of your classics would get ordered whether or not they're on the menu, but regardless, you're making it harder on yourself, and you're making it harder on your customers to make a choice. I would cut half from each side.  3) If you want to bring your seasonal list more in line with your classics, try to make them classically inspired. Take a classic, put a little spin on it by changing one of the ingredients and/or the way it's served and you're off to the races. For instance, I would take that tea infused rum you're making, sub it for the vodka in a Moscow Mule, and use lemon instead of lime. Boom!"

This also opens up the opportunity for upselling. Add prices or list a blanket price at the top. Trust me, people will appreciate it. Create a separate beer list.  You're isolating a whole demographic and forcing them to choose on-the-spot. I like the seasonal cocktails.  Maybe say that you're using 1800 silver, not 1800. They all taste different and that's important. Idea: Fuse the Hot-2-Trot and the Stoned Cucumber into one drink.  I worked at a Mexican restaurant and our Cucumber-Jalapeno margarita was fucking delicious. I'll give you the recipe if you'd like.

Old fashioned cocktails, negronis and martinis are so standard and common that it's unncessary to present on a menu in my opinion, unless there is some unique twist to them. I feel the same about fireball, chocolate cake and buttery nipple--you can always recommend these to a customer who is looking for shots but since there is nothing new about them, they don't really need to be on the menu.  I think some of the specialty cocktail names are kind of cheesy. I second the suggestion of combining drinks with similar ingredients and adding some variety. If you need some ideas for light, refreshing drinks, try a cucumber gimlet with Hendricks, muddled cucumber, lime and simple. It's really nice. Chambord might be overkill in your berry mojito if more than a float/dash for colour is intended.   And, from a design standpoint, I would choose a different font. That's just my personal preference though. I prefer serif, haha."

bartenders,39hhhf,AsinineRhymes,2,Thu Jun 11 23:32:21 2015 UTC,"More my restuarant management side here- your menu should NOT mention low inventory. A lot of people would look at that like ""oh wow they can't even stock sangria, they must not sell much"""

bartenders,39hhhf,belowthisisalie,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:58:58 2015 UTC,"Not a very good balance between spirits or ingredients. A lot of your flavor profiles overlap between drinks. The list lacks spirit focused cocktails on your seasonal list.   You could afford to remove a third of the selections from each list. This will increase speed of service, and will help guests make decisions faster.  Work with your reps to get deals on smaller brands and it will make your listing unique.   Personally, I would not have my name on the listing. It's one thing if you are a destination craft cocktail bar with truly inspired cocktails. This is just like my opinion though man.  Edit: I would also lose the shot menu to make room for beers."

bartenders,39gzat,FiletOfBaby,4,Thu Jun 11 17:29:29 2015 UTC,I hate it. Feels like I went down a cul-de-sac in life. Friends became subordinates and either didn't respect me or became distant. Switched pubs within the chain and there were a whole load more problems. Moved to an indy and now I'm feeling like I'm stuck where I am.  With the company I was with it was a huge amount more stress for barely a couple of pints a week extra cash. Also I feel like it would have been easier to go on to doing something else if I hadn't gone up to management. I do regret it to be honest.
bartenders,39gzat,andthecircus,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:30:58 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, do you work in a more corporate environment or otherwise. I live in a major city and it's fairly easy to find a management job with less bullshit to deal with. In my experience most of the bars around here are run by the Owner, Chef, and Bar Manager all together.   Just trying to get an idea of your environment. Maybe it's not the job itself but where you work.  It sounds like your experience mirrors the manager at my last job. He was a great bartender and when he was promoted he lost his friends, regulars, even his wife."
bartenders,39gzat,matticus379,4,Thu Jun 11 20:06:41 2015 UTC,"Tl;dr It was the best possibly the best decision I ever made...aside from marrying my wife :) If you don't want to read the wall of text, Bo Burnham sums it up pretty well here: [https://youtu.be/0jBK4qDJ-OM]   (If the link doesnt work it's ""left brain, right brain it's on youtube)  I didn't witness the change in myself when I took the reins of my bar but my guests and my wife did.  One of my guests told me once ""You are always so happy and full of energy behind the bar until that clipboard comes out. Then you get this scowl all over your face. You are still very pleasant to talk to, but you don't look that way normally, it's weird.""  I guess I had never REALLY thought about it before. I had always thought bartender me and bar manager me were the same guy. Things are not always what they seem but it really is only what you make of it. It doesn't have to really be that big of a deal unless you make it one.  I was promoted to bar manager a little over two years ago. I asked for the promotion for two reasons. The first was that I had already been doing the work (ordering, inventory, menu writing) for over two years at that point (the gm/owner acted as manager but I got the labor of it). I earned it, I deserved it, he recognized that and gave me the title when I asked for it. The second was far more personal. I had hit a particularly low point in my life and I NEEDED something to validate me. I could see my accomplishments behind the bar, but did not feel as though I had actually grown at all. I don't know why this particular title validated me so much but that in turn became motivation and drive. I couldn't hold myself back anymore but it was a strangely difficult transition because I had never really wanted to be more than a bartender like yourself.  My particular position is special though. I don't know how it works at other places, but here I am the bar manager and the lead/main bartender. I have a shit ton of paperwork, and people are up my ass with insanity on the daily but most of my time is still spent crafting cocktails and entertaining my guests. I get to do what I love as well as learn how to provide a well organized space for future bartenders to learn and grow in.  It is my bar now. When the remodel and concept change happened at the beginning of this year I was able to build lists the way I wanted them, use the products and brands that I wanted to use. No more being stuck with shit products that just sit there because anybody worth their salt will flat out refuse to sell it. I placed every bottle on that shelf and I have a reason why it's there. I can tell you where it came from, how it's made and how to make it shine in the right cocktail.  My menu has grown from four or five major brand name whiskies to over 70 local, hand crafted and world whiskies (that number is still growing). I have tasted and evaluated every single one. I can find a whiskey for anybody, if you don't like whiskey it's because you haven't dealt with me yet. My cocktail list has grown from six to twenty setting the stage for a bevy of my own creations standing atop a strong foundation of the classics.  I am underpaid (non salary), overworked, and loving almost every single minute of it. Even when there is a scowl on my face I am smiling on the inside. But that in and of itself is the real challenge now. How do we keep smiling on the outside?  The skills you will attain from the new role WILL bring added stress and others WILL notice the effect. I am in a constant struggle but am working on it.   Manager me is a hard ass. I want what I want and I want it now. Do it right the first time so you don't have to do it again. Ask as many questions as you need to I am here for whatever you need to know, but don't waste my time with stupid shit you should probably already have down pat.  Bartender me is a hard ass as well, but in a much different way. Bartender me is far more easy going, in the moment, creative, and passionate. Happy to teach and quite a bit...well...free, for lack of a better word. I am still demanding and anal retentive about details but I have worked very hard to attain the skills and knowledge I have, and now that I understand how to use them, I consistently amaze others and myself with what I can make work. My bar is my playground and my guests and coworkers are my schoolyard chums.  The hardest part is getting those two aspects of myself to get along.  If you decide to go for it I think it will be very good for you as a person but it will also make you a better, more knowledgeable bartender. It is not easy or glamorous but it is rewarding when people ask in amazement who maintains this bar? I proudly say, ""I do"".  Ultimately however, you have to remember that at the end of the day it is just putting alcohol into a glass. The details can bog you down at times. You might get lost in them. You may need to find a way, at some point, to remember how to play. Don't loose sight of how fun it is supposed to be and why you love this business in the first place. Be organized, be approachable, have fun and good luck with whatever you choose!"

I will say I'm taking my time and I will be picky. I'm not going to take any job that comes my way just because it's a job and I'm a gun for hire. If I do it, it has to be in a place that I respect and respects me. I'm in no hurry so I need to make sure it's worth it.

Nobody wants their tender/server staring at them as they write in the tip. Hopefully your owners spring for a print machine or something more practical.  That being said, if it were me... I would do the entire process in front of the guest as quickly as possible before holding it out to them. If that are unfamiliar with it, they will comment on it and it leaves you open to explain ""yeah it's really simple, you just sign here, verify the total and gratuity here, then hit authorize and choose how/if you want to get your receipt."" Be brief and informative with what you say, but emphasize gratuity. Don't be shy, most people would say ""where do I tip you?"" anyways.  Voiding the sale? What program are you using? On a busy night, if you won't often have to use that button, I would fashion something that covers the touch are that can void, but that can be lifted easily in case you need to use it.

It was 100% voluntary. And while they could've suggested to you a general percentage, I think even that got close to blurring the lines of the law.

bartenders,39dek3,SammyC914,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:21:39 2015 UTC,"They don't tip out for getting their food run?  At my restaurant, I get tipped out 5% of the total TIPS for each server, not based on sales. Sometimes I come out ahead, sometimes not, overall it balances out.  I also help them out on the floor if I'm not busy and they are slammed.  The restaurant also has a seperate lounge-bar area, when I bartend there it's just me and 1 cocktail server. I get 20% of cocktail servers tips, for basically making all their drinks, cleaning all the glassware, and dealing with the bustubs of dishes and the trash (I am my own barback).  And then on any of my own foodsales at either bar, I tipout 5-10% of the total foodsales for the runners, depending on how those patrons tipped me."
bartenders,39dek3,AtlJayhawk,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:01:39 2015 UTC,our bartender tips out no one. we tip out 3% of our alcohol sales. 90% of our alcohol sales are wine by the glass. my restaurant is in a retirement community. our bartender doesn't help us out at all. but we run all their food and help them out all we can if we are bored.
bartenders,39dek3,DavesOddysee,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:16:11 2015 UTC,"I'm currently a bartender and I have been a server, however I think it may work slightly differently. What there should be is a common figure, something that is consistent throughout all staff. When I was a bar supervisor - I introduced an initiative which saw Bar Support (glass washers) get 10% of everyone's earnings, a bar team of six and an average tip total of around £20 meant everyone kind of got a fair deal.  What we do at my current place is, pool all the tips then at the end of the month split them proportionately between who worked the most hours and who did the least."

bartenders,39dek3,binger5,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:28:13 2015 UTC,"Make management set a number, preferably based on sales instead of tip(because those can be tracked). Tipout based on discretion only causes needless drama."

bartenders,39dek3,PanzerPhoto,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:46:34 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on the type of establishment. Currently I work at a cocktail bar that leans towards a college crowd. The servers tip is 6% on their drink sales. I also bartended at a restaurant that the servers tipped 10% of drink sales. I think 10% was appropriate in the restaurant because I was primarily a service bartender and had only a few seats at the bar. 4-6% is more appropriate at a bar since almost all of the server's tips are coming from alcohol sales. Regardless though, the bar tip out should be standardized and every server should be held to that standard."
bartenders,39dek3,Mitch_from_Boston,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:09:18 2015 UTC,3%.  Though who is complaining about being tipped out higher than that?

I've analyzed the usage for dozens of bars, over the years; and it is the same (almost without exception) in all of them. They keep vermouth in stock and use somewhere between 0 and .25oz. per Martini rung up; usually closer to .10 oz., on average.   There are times when I can see that most, if not all, Martinis were made dry."

bartenders,39bewe,whatsreallygoingon,3,Mon Jun 15 13:45:24 2015 UTC,I wonder why people are getting away from vermouth.
bartenders,39bewe,SammyC914,8,Wed Jun 10 17:02:39 2015 UTC,It's been like that in Southern California for a long time. I used to ask vodka drinkers if they wanted vermouth and they would scoff usually. That's why I stopped asking. They all want Grey Goose up with olives. 9/10 they just ask for a martini and get offended when they have to explain to me what kind. Rich white people are annoying.
bartenders,39bewe,jeremyjack33,5,Wed Jun 10 17:08:41 2015 UTC,"I always hated dirty martinis the most because it is so subjective and you get the annoying ""porn star dirty"" or ""XXX dirty"" orders.  I was always tempted to pour 3 oz of olive juice and splash it with rail vodka just to see if they would drink it."
bartenders,39bewe,toodarntall,3,Wed Jun 10 18:26:37 2015 UTC,"Funny you should say that. Once, when working an early daytime shift...I had a customer ask for a super dirty martini. This was a college bar, so it was served in a plastic cup (the most awkward thing ever); I still happily obliged. I quickly retrieve the olive juice from the back and put it in the same size cup the martini was to be served in.  Yep, you guessed it...I gave him the cup of olive juice instead of the martini I had made him. Not minutes later I realized my mistake...he was a great sport about it, he drank almost half of it before I told him what happened. I felt terrible, but he laughed it off, ""And here I was thinking this is THE DIRTIEST martini I've ever had.""  tl:dr working the college bar morning shift can result in some hilarity when you are sleep deprived"
bartenders,39bewe,Tswtzr22,2,Wed Jun 10 21:31:56 2015 UTC,I had a lady complain I made her martini too dirty. Then the remake wasn't dirty enough. So I poured it exactly like I did the first time. She said it was perfect.  Either she's way too picky or she was trying to score some free booze.

bartenders,39bewe,daementia,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:00:51 2015 UTC,We're in the middle of Oil and Gas week here and every American that shuffles into my bar wants a dirty Goose martini.
bartenders,39bewe,daementia,3,Wed Jun 10 22:59:54 2015 UTC,"One of the main reasons people are getting away from vermouth is so many places don't refrigerate their vermouth (sweet or dry). Vermouth is a fortified wine and left out will spoil a week after being opened and just gets bitter and nasty. Throw that in a martini and you can see why so many people get turned off of it.   I bartend at a high end restaurant and I pour a hell of a lot of martinis, vodka and gin. A good portion of our clientele is older, but the younger generation is definitely getting in on the action, just more of those are requested dry and a lot of dirty ones as well.   I pour 3oz in my martinis. Keeping with the 5:1 ratio that's 2.5oz gin or vodka, .5 oz vermouth. I have never had a complaint and plenty or reorders, so start dropping in some more and see how people react."
bartenders,39bewe,Hepcat10,2,Thu Jun 11 14:38:49 2015 UTC,"I think it's just one of those trends. Cocktails change and evolve like fashion. It does surprise me that craft cocktail bars don't follow the old-style recipe, though.  I used to be a cocktail waitress in various high-end bars, in the '90s, and back then it was assumed that a Martini contained vermouth. It seems like it gradually became a thing to order it ""dry"" as code for ""I want a straight double"" but I don't want to sound like a complete boozer. As though the dash of vermouth is going to water down the drink, ha ha!  Personally, I still make mine with vermouth, and would prefer that bartenders made mine that way."

bartenders,39bewe,Tornado2251,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:08:33 2015 UTC,"Because too many bars don't refrigerate their vermouth, and spoiled vermouth tastes bad, but people don't know that, so they think they don't like vermouth."

I usually make the mistake of simply ordering a Gin martini and then find myself answering a bartender's question or two. I can see how can get annoying to someone who's tending a busy bar."
bartenders,395xjl,thepasttenseofdraw,-2,Tue Jun 9 16:18:59 2015 UTC,"Now now, a martini is always Gin and vermouth with a twist or olive, no ifs ands or buts.  If you want to specify vodka, it's a vodka martini. To say otherwise is blasphemy.  Just because the customer is ignorant to the drink doesn't mean the recipe changes.  Please, let me know how I'm wrong then."
bartenders,395xjl,beermanbarman,21,Tue Jun 9 16:43:42 2015 UTC,"But if you make an ignorant customer a drink they don't want, then you just have to start over and make them the one they do want. Being right isn't worth losing precious time over."

A lot of us work in bars that sell a few $65 pours of whiskey and $200+ bottles of wine. If someone challenges you on the price, you need to have the knowledge, confidence, and professionalism to explain why that exists.   If they are normally a ""house cab"" type of person, you need to explain why they might want to try a bottle from left bank Bordeaux rather than a generic ""California.""    Why should they drink a small batch with a splash of water over a $6 shot of Jack? Granted, if you work club volume and don't have time to talk, do your thing, but wouldn't it be cool to turn somebody onto craft Bourbons when they originally thought they wanted a ""whiskey ginger.""   OMG. You don't know what a martini is?!?!? Turn it into a learning experience, and even if they never come back to you, you taught someone how and why to spend more on booze. Which is a blessing to all of us in the industry.   I get tired of articles like this. DAE HATE THEIR JOB?!?!!? No. Actually I don't."

bartenders,395xjl,TonyHTonyH,7,Tue Jun 9 21:32:53 2015 UTC,"The point here isn't whether a ""Vodka Martini"" is called a ""Kangaroo"" or any such nonsense. The issue here is how to comport oneself in a bar like a pro. And in the process keep from getting yourself tossed out on your ear for bad behaviour. Wish I'd known this sooner. Perhaps then I wouldn't have lost hearing in that one ear!"

bartenders,398ebl,MoodyMelody,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:39:33 2015 UTC,"Lots and lots of espresso martini's! We have 2 methods of how they are mixed: 45mls espresso, 30mls vodka (Smirnoff is house but a more expensive vodka can be used for extra $), 30mls Tia Maria (my manager is really dumb sometimes and got rid of Kaluha), and 20mls of sugar syrup. Shake this shit out of it and double strain into a large martini class with 3 coffee beans and a strip of cinnamon. The more expensive version is: 45mls espresso, 30mls patron cafe XO and 30mls of Grey Goose vodka. Normal version is $18 and the more expensive is $22 i believe. I live in Australia, so if that seems expensive to you, welcome to alcohol in Aus!"
bartenders,398ebl,Sgt_Croissant,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:49:24 2015 UTC,"As far as I can tell, the biggest factor in how a person orders their martini is age. The older they are, the more likely it is that they just want 3 cold ounces of cocktail and they don't give a fuck beyond that. Younger drinkers tend to be more adventurous, and far more likely to get a true traditional gin martini (I've even have a few guys who want OG ratios with more vermouth than spirit). As always, your mileage may vary."

You're not paying for just the drink (same goes for food). You're paying for the people who pour you the drink, the space you're occupying, etc..
