coys,3e2rd1,EriCOYS,4,Tue Jul 21 17:24:57 2015 UTC,Went to see the peterbrough spurs XI game.  Cy Goddard stood out. Hes a absolute midget and no muscle on him but boy can he play. Excellent touch and dribbling and really gets his head up and can play the killer ball. Drew a fantastic save a 25 yard free kick.  Looked impressive to me.

coys,3e2rd1,GMC1377,8,Tue Jul 21 22:51:20 2015 UTC,"A pre-contract, not a pro contract, unfortunately."
coys,3e2rd1,Doomchicken7,11,Tue Jul 21 15:09:14 2015 UTC,Isn't a pre contract an agreement that he will sign a pro contract on his 17th birthday?
coys,3e2rd1,john87000,3,Tue Jul 21 15:15:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, but he has no obligation to actually follow through with it. We won't know until he turns 17. Have a feeling with the removal of Spurs from his profile and the kind of shit he retweets he'll be off. Think someone out there will give him stupid money."
coys,3e2rd1,nssmuckers,3,Tue Jul 21 16:04:16 2015 UTC,we really need to try to hang on to him
coys,3e2rd1,CareOfCell44,3,Tue Jul 21 16:22:55 2015 UTC,He was also pictured in arsenal and west ham kits in the last couple of months. His attitude is pretty shit for a kid who hasn't even turned 17 yet

coys,3e2rd1,Sufficientrobotics,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:18:21 2015 UTC,"I'm sure we will try, but with the money that is being thrown at kids by the oil clubs I think it's pretty likely we'll lose some of our youngsters in the coming years. Another glorious byproduct of FFP and of course the homegrown quota is wealthy clubs snatching up young English players before they become too expensive.   I'm normally not one to get sanctimonious about the practices of clubs like Chelsea and City, but to me shit like the Izzy Brown deal seems fucking reprehensible...it seems like something that damages not only English football clubs but the English national team as well. The kid would be a regular in West Brom's first team by now if he'd just stayed there, and instead he's made one token appearance for Chelsea probably in a meaningless game. He's probably making more money than Bentaleb and Mason too.   Like I don't mind buying a kid who has already become a first team regular at a young age, but Chelsea swooped in when Brown was still 16. It's just a fucked up trend.  We also have to put a lot of blame on the scum of the earth agents in all of this. Even though they could probably make more money in the long run if they advise their clients to develop at a club where they will break into the first team sooner, they are the ones with $$ in their eyes."
coys,3e2rd1,nssmuckers,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:10:09 2015 UTC,Brown is on loan at Vitesse now so he won't play for them next season either.
coys,3e2rd1,john87000,5,Tue Jul 21 19:24:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, however it doesn't give as much protection against other clubs as a pro contract."

coys,3e2rd1,JohnMulroy,3,Tue Jul 21 14:59:04 2015 UTC,"Someone compared his game to Welbeck's earlier. I've only seen highlights so I can't confirm, certainly looks like him though.   He certainly had confidence vs. Reading. Best of luck to him, maybe we'll see him out in Denver."

coys,3e2rd1,nssmuckers,2,Tue Jul 21 19:15:12 2015 UTC,Fantastic!  Looks so promising already.
coys,3e2rd1,Tbickle,2,Tue Jul 21 15:02:44 2015 UTC,Im not sure I understand how the contract works and why exactly he isnt eligible for a pro contract?  A lot of people here seem to be under the impression hes younger than he is- Onomah is 18.
coys,3e2rd1,jedabe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:52:00 2015 UTC,People are talking about Marcus Edwards who is 16.

coys,3e2rd1,jedabe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:53:03 2015 UTC,So? That comment has nothing wrong with it.
coys,3e3kg2,Blubbey,29,Tue Jul 21 18:10:31 2015 UTC,Werner would be a fantastic exciting signing.
coys,3e3kg2,i-spye,23,Tue Jul 21 18:12:57 2015 UTC,"If we could get Werner or N'Jie and then McCarthy, while also moving Ade on loan to Villa, that would be a pretty successful window."
coys,3e3kg2,NatrolleonBonaparte,21,Tue Jul 21 18:26:03 2015 UTC,Forget successful. Maybe one of our best ever in terms of solidifying the squad with quality players and prospects across the board.
coys,3e3kg2,Koinfamous2,23,Tue Jul 21 18:40:59 2015 UTC,Really should be careful calling a transfer window one of the best ever before our signings start playing.
coys,3e3kg2,mrmunchkin62,2,Tue Jul 21 19:28:07 2015 UTC,"""in theory"" lol shall I edit original post? Obviously I'm not going to get carried away, but somehow in a matter of months we would have been able to stockpile a decent number of highly sought-after prospects. In terms of business, it is excellent. In terms of performance, yes that's to be determined, but these purchase aren't going to break the bank, so they're a bit more appealing."
coys,3e3kg2,Koinfamous2,9,Tue Jul 21 20:04:03 2015 UTC,"What he's saying is this is exactly the sentiment people had with the Bale replacements. That went from ""best transfer window ever"" to ""calamity"" real quick."
coys,3e3kg2,sirtetris,6,Tue Jul 21 20:09:58 2015 UTC,"True, but in that case we effectively bought a whole new first eleven. This one we've strengthened in the areas that need it and will have maybe 2 or 3 new starters that will have been bought with the managers approval. We all got excited about the bale window because I've never in my life seen Spurs spend so much money on 'big' players. This time it feels sensible and measured. But time will tell and let's see who we actually get."
coys,3e3kg2,barnetto2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:04:01 2015 UTC,"Exactly. This window hasn't been about spending millions, but on making smart, measured purchases. Depth is a HUGE issue we've had lately. Having a true backup for every position is invaluable."
coys,3e3kg2,Koinfamous2,6,Tue Jul 21 21:45:21 2015 UTC,"yeah, really.  i'm not too keen on mccarthy as i think we need someone better, but if we got all three somehow, we'd be set for a long time."
coys,3e3kg2,aigletunisien,2,Tue Jul 21 19:24:14 2015 UTC,"Same. I would prefer Rabiot though.  Rabiot, N'Jie, and Werner and we'd have an average match day age of like 22. I love it.  We have experience in our 2 CBs and GK and everyone else can just go bonkers and we'll be alright. They're bound to put something in. Toby, Jan and Hugo can make sure nothing goes in the wrong side."
coys,3e3kg2,kde01,10,Tue Jul 21 20:34:47 2015 UTC,All of the above + sell Vlad and buy Rabiot #yolo
coys,3e3kg2,nssmuckers,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:35:42 2015 UTC,"Do you think we'd be willing to take that hit though? We haven't spent a net dime in 6 seasons. I suspect we'd be looking at 20m+ net if we buy those players, even if we end up selling a few more. I suppose getting Adebayor off our books would free up a lot of funds."
coys,3e3kg2,joeykittens,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:12:55 2015 UTC,Think Bobby needs to go too for it to be a resounding success.
coys,3e3kg2,NatrolleonBonaparte,15,Tue Jul 21 22:20:31 2015 UTC,"Tl;dr:  Timo Werner, Clinton N’Jie (both forwards), James McCarthy (central midfielder) are reported targets.  ""Teenager Werner is one of the most highly-rated young players in Germany and has played for the national team at all the youth levels, while 21-year-old N’Jie has been hailed as Cameroon’s successor to Samuel Eto’o.""  ""Lyon are thought to want around £12m for N’Jie, while 19-year-old Werner would cost around £10m. Chelsea’s Victor Moses is also of interest to Tottenham, but is further down their list of priorities.""  ""Spurs could still test Everton’s resolve to keep midfielder James McCarthy and will wait to find out how his talks with manager Roberto Martinez went before deciding whether or not to press ahead with a bid. Everton want to keep McCarthy, but Spurs are willing to make a straight cash bid or offer winger Aaron Lennon as part of a deal if they are given any encouragement the 24-year-old will be allowed to leave Goodison Park. """
coys,3e3kg2,Badger_Botherer,8,Tue Jul 21 18:11:36 2015 UTC,Also it mentions that Adebayor could be off to Villa on loan.
coys,3e3kg2,kde01,4,Tue Jul 21 18:26:18 2015 UTC,"From memory he has 12 months left yes? For villa a loan is perfect, if we get rid of his waves slash mayne get a fee - perfect"
coys,3e3kg2,xsvfan,2,Tue Jul 21 18:40:32 2015 UTC,Yes it is. For Villa.  We'll still be paying it and Adebayor will be without a contract with anyone at the end of the year. I don't think he'll agree to the loan unless we reach the end of the window and there's no one out for him.
coys,3e3kg2,kde01,4,Tue Jul 21 20:37:52 2015 UTC,"If Werner is only 10m, I think we must sign him."
coys,3e3kg2,sickgrof,7,Tue Jul 21 19:38:14 2015 UTC,Assuming he's willing to join and doesn't have different offers.
coys,3e3kg2,kde01,-1,Tue Jul 21 20:29:00 2015 UTC,Sell Ade and put Werner and N'Jie on 50k each.
coys,3e3kg2,sickgrof,8,Tue Jul 21 20:38:15 2015 UTC,And this is why we have Levy.
coys,3e3kg2,PotentialConfidentia,0,Tue Jul 21 20:56:16 2015 UTC,I wasn't being serious. I guess that needs to be spelled out very specifically in here since down votes rain on anyone not toeing the line.
coys,3e3kg2,kde01,5,Tue Jul 21 21:09:23 2015 UTC,"To be fair (and I didn't downvote you), there is absolutely no part of your statement that implies it was a joke. You really can't blame people for not getting that."
coys,3e3kg2,MrJDMTyte,2,Tue Jul 21 21:11:14 2015 UTC,I think McCarthy is a solid player but I'd want someone of a bit of a higher standard to slot in beside Bentaleb.  Maybe I haven't seen him enough but the impression I get of him is that he'd be an improvement over Mason and a lot of our 'squad' options but not an improvement enough for where we're aiming for.
coys,3e3kg2,itinerantmarshmallow,2,Tue Jul 21 19:52:37 2015 UTC,"but not an improvement enough for where we're aiming for.    Agreed, but he has potential. He's only 24 so he can get better. He's a very hard worker on the pitch and in training. He can do a job in a double pivot.  While I don't think he's our first choice (and nor should he be) I think he's the safest bet. Especially if Everton want Lennon."
coys,3e3kg2,MrJDMTyte,3,Tue Jul 21 20:39:18 2015 UTC,I don't think people realise how good mccarthy actually is
coys,3e3kg2,mrmunchkin62,3,Tue Jul 21 21:36:00 2015 UTC,I know right? Talk to any Everton fan and they talk about him like most people here talk about Bentaleb.
coys,3e3kg2,caribouslack,2,Tue Jul 21 22:03:16 2015 UTC,"Totally, keep in mind they paid £16m for him as well, he's a quality player and probably the best on their books now"
coys,3e3kg2,Koinfamous2,7,Tue Jul 21 22:07:21 2015 UTC,Sub would collectively jizz if timos signed
coys,3e3kg2,kde01,5,Tue Jul 21 19:28:53 2015 UTC,Is N jie that highly rated?
coys,3e3kg2,YourDadsFather,3,Tue Jul 21 19:08:55 2015 UTC,Watch a few YouTube videos of him and it's evident he is gifted physically and has given of footballing qualities. Could be a great player with more development.
coys,3e3kg2,Neutralenemy,5,Tue Jul 21 20:00:40 2015 UTC,I've heard him called a good Andros Townsend

coys,3e2qz2,BagofBullHammers,12,Tue Jul 21 14:42:50 2015 UTC,"While I understand the reasoning behind the top comment being ""/r/coyscirclejerk,"" I do think that commenting ""/r/coyscirclejerk"" to any post that's humorous has become a bit of a circle jerk itself. When something has (at this moment) 31 upvotes and an 84% upvote rate, then maybe it's actually posted in the right place? And if it's not, wouldn't the downvote button serve its purpose?  And if it's generally agreed upon that a post could/should go in /r/coyscirclejerk, then isn't there a more tactful way to approach this?

coys,3e0y4l,tottenhamhotsauce,6,Tue Jul 21 06:26:02 2015 UTC,Well liked on 100k wages. Fuck that. I don't care how good his Instagram is he's not worth that much.
coys,3e0y4l,alterego87,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:56:48 2015 UTC,Who said he's on 100k wages?   The only report I've seen about his wages show 55k (GBP). Puts him in the middle of the squad in terms of earnings. I think that's about what Bentaleb makes. And Bentaleb wasn't one of the top five for goals in La Liga for half a decade.  EDIT: Downvoted for not hopping on the Soldado hate train. Stay classy /r/coys.
coys,3e0y4l,kde01,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:08:20 2015 UTC,I never mentioned either of those things... but it seems like negative conjecture and a cynical attitude that would be better attributed towards a player like Ade. I'd say Kaboul as well but we've already sold him.
coys,3e0y4l,tottenhamhotsauce,0,Tue Jul 21 11:02:59 2015 UTC,His wages are closer to half that.
coys,3e0y4l,p_gascoigne,5,Tue Jul 21 15:11:37 2015 UTC,If Levy is factoring any of that into his decision to sell or not than he should be fired. The game is about glory winning.
coys,3e0y4l,GeneralSauerkraut,-2,Tue Jul 21 04:35:02 2015 UTC,"He'll sell for the right price, I think its hilarious how people still doubt him. He's learned from every window. That doesnt change the fact the Soldado is well liked by everyone at the club."
coys,3e0y4l,tottenhamhotsauce,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:46:53 2015 UTC,yes we would. this is the last window Levy will be able to get any sort of fee over 10m potentially for him. he hasn't worked out and never will.
coys,3e0y4l,melihs11,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:08:31 2015 UTC,"Adebayor, Lennon, and Chiriches are likely to leave whether or not there's backup. Soldado most likely will not leave as we have to strengthen in midfield, at LW, and at CF (to replace Ade) before we can even consider selling Soldado. Even then he'll only be sold if we feel we can get another CF in before the end of the window AFTER selling Soldado.  With rumblings of Townsend leaving as well that would make Soldado even less likely to leave as we'll then need a replacement in that position as well."
coys,3e0y4l,kde01,46,Tue Jul 21 15:10:01 2015 UTC,Good business from him. It seems it was actually a good career move to come to Spurs.
coys,3e0y4l,TjStax,26,Tue Jul 21 03:00:05 2015 UTC,Damn it. Really liked Benji tbh. Wonder if Levy will sign a CDM now.

coys,3e0y4l,andrew137,6,Tue Jul 21 04:26:39 2015 UTC,"We have Carroll, Dembele, Bentaleb and Mason.  Surely we can get by with just one signing and not two more?"
coys,3e0y4l,timo_bee,10,Tue Jul 21 08:01:23 2015 UTC,And Alli
coys,3e0y4l,BritishBatman,34,Tue Jul 21 09:07:20 2015 UTC,"Sorry but that's the midfield of a mid-table club.  Mason was exposed last year way too often, Dembele was inconsistent and Carroll was hardly good enough to start for Swansea."
coys,3e0y4l,andrew137,8,Tue Jul 21 08:55:05 2015 UTC,"But then again, it was Mason's first season after a loan to League One. Not to say he isn't devoid of any flaws, but people here love to conveniently ignore that fact and say how we should splash on a great CM whilst continue to call ourselves unlike one of those ""filthy oil-money rich clubs.""  He isn't young and he isn't perfect, but you don't give up on players after a season of mediocrity."
coys,3e0y4l,arcisal,8,Tue Jul 21 10:28:34 2015 UTC,"You also don't leave yourself very thin in the midfield relying on players to ""come good"". I don't doubt that Mason will improve this season - I'd be very surprised if he didn't and I don't doubt that Caroll and Ali will also improve - but the chances of them becoming top 4 quality over the space of an offseason is very, very thin and expecting it to happen and not putting plans into place for when it may not happen is asking for failure.   The way you develop players whilst maintaining a high level of performance is to slowly integrate them into the squad in unimportant games until they prove that they are at the required level. You certainly don't sell most of your midfield and leave them as your only hope."
coys,3e0y4l,andrew137,51,Tue Jul 21 10:35:23 2015 UTC,At 3:40am. I know people said Stambouli was slow...

coys,3e0y4l,yash96,4,Tue Jul 21 03:26:36 2015 UTC,"Remember when he came in, it seemed like he was training with the team for awhile before the official transfer was announced, and there were no rumors in advance and very little on a fee. The whole thing was just odd."

coys,3e0y4l,p_gascoigne,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:41:49 2015 UTC,No this is not weird at all. PSG needed a midfielder they could use in rotation against weaker opponents in Ligue 1. He's proven himself in France and propably doesn't mind sitting on bench.
coys,3e0y4l,jaziis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:09:42 2015 UTC,They also need more French players.  He's a good player. He's just not good in our system. He's exactly what PSG needs for competition outside of the top 5 (and outside of the CL).
coys,3e0y4l,kde01,8,Tue Jul 21 15:12:44 2015 UTC,Such a strange transfer all around.
coys,3e0y4l,Spurs94,4,Tue Jul 21 03:52:33 2015 UTC,Glad to get him off the books tbh.
coys,3e0y4l,AiHangLo,3,Tue Jul 21 05:18:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was clear Poch just didn't think he was good enough. Leaves a spot for someone else to come in or step up."
coys,3e0y4l,Spurs94,2,Tue Jul 21 05:25:50 2015 UTC,I think he's totally.good enough. A squad player for PSG is at least a squad player for us. It's more about fit and suitability than quality.
coys,3e0y4l,smokey815,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:27:38 2015 UTC,In the few minutes he got he never suggested otherwise.
coys,3e0y4l,AiHangLo,4,Tue Jul 21 05:27:27 2015 UTC,"He seemed solid enough just way too slow. Don't think he was quick enough on his feet or with the ball for what Poch wanted. For a squad player, he seemed good enough."
coys,3e0y4l,Spurs94,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:29:45 2015 UTC,"If Mason and Bentaleb, as good as they are forced him out he wasn't good enough as a squad player."
coys,3e0y4l,AiHangLo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:33:47 2015 UTC,"Not really, it's part of Levy's strategy: buy cheap talent. If it works stick if it doesn't sell on for cost or profit."
coys,3e0y4l,ryuumac,5,Tue Jul 21 12:59:05 2015 UTC,I really hope he finds success for them. It's a shame he didn't fit in our system very well. Good luck Benji <3

coys,3e0y4l,mindlessnerd,5,Tue Jul 21 03:53:29 2015 UTC,not a bad player at all just never really got a chance becuase of Mason and Bentaleb breaking out. I do wish we kept him though as a good rotation option. good luck to him
coys,3e0y4l,combatjohnny,6,Tue Jul 21 08:06:11 2015 UTC,"For the first time in quite a while, this summer speaks of a far greater degree of communication between Mauricio and Daniel. Poch telling (hopefully) everyone who is staying and who is surplus to requirements, and Levy going out and getting deals done, some even at a slight loss (Capoue? Paulinho?)      Almost unprecedented at Spurs if reports from previous managers are to be believed. Hopefully this will also speak to more Pochettino style players to be signed.     I just have this lovely thought of Levy, Pochettino, Paul Mitchell, and Franco Baldini all meeting for a pub lunch and a couple gin and tonics and discussing players and Spurs related bits, as well as how everyone's kids are doing, and whether or not England will win the Ashes."
coys,3e0y4l,MauricioPochettino,-1,Tue Jul 21 09:09:38 2015 UTC,Do you always talk about yourself in the third-person?
coys,3e0y4l,Shinfo1882,13,Tue Jul 21 13:00:27 2015 UTC,"Good luck to him.  That means we have Bentaleb, Mason, Dembele, Carroll, and Alli. At least one of these players is leaving on a permanent or is to go on loan, and Winks may be moving up permanently to first team football. Pochettino and Levy may not move for anyone else this window in this position."
coys,3e0y4l,TheRealMountainGoat,25,Tue Jul 21 03:00:59 2015 UTC,then we will be in big trouble. that group of CM's is far too weak and inexperienced. we are a Bentaleb injury away from having an incredibly average midfield now. we will sign a new CM.
coys,3e0y4l,melihs11,5,Tue Jul 21 04:09:01 2015 UTC,"Tbh, even with any of Stambo/Paulinho/Capoue we were one injury from an incredibly average midfield. Bentaleb is the only one I have absolute faith in."
coys,3e0y4l,minimus_,2,Tue Jul 21 09:19:56 2015 UTC,Agreed. It's imperative we sign a new CM
coys,3e0y4l,melihs11,6,Tue Jul 21 12:39:10 2015 UTC,"I bloody hope not.  One quality player with occasional reminders of his inexperience, one average player, one good player who Poch don't seem to like, a player who couldn't break into Swanseas squad for half the season, and a lad whose only played League 1 football and is 19.  Not exactly world beaters."

coys,3e0y4l,DanArlington,2,Tue Jul 21 06:29:05 2015 UTC,"Don't feel too bad for him, he got shipped off to a CL squad. He'll probably see some L1 time here and there, get a chance to make a name for himself in his home country again. I think this was good for both sides."

I'm not sure if Stambo will get any game time in Paris, but he wasn't getting any with us anyway.

coys,3e2oj5,DanArlington,11,Tue Jul 21 14:23:07 2015 UTC,I haven't been this excited about a young player arriving at Spurs since Bale.  He has the physical tools as well as the technical ability to be a star if he keeps progressing and he's coming to the club at a position of need.  Not to mention the fact that Pochettino has shown a willingness to play youngsters.
coys,3e2oj5,FireEyedBoy,12,Tue Jul 21 15:30:21 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest, if he's anywhere near as good as he's billed, he might take Mason's spot sooner rather than later. Mason isn't exactly a rock defensively, and Alli seems like he might be both more promising and more athletic. If he has a similar mentality, he might end up in the first XI soon. Obviously have to see how he adjusts and fits in, but from a talent stand point I think it's a decent shout."
coys,3e2oj5,smokey815,6,Tue Jul 21 14:34:41 2015 UTC,"For some reason I had figured that Alli was a more slight player. Shocked to find out he's actually 188cm (~6'2""). I'm psyched to watch him play this year."
coys,3e2oj5,waffuls1,2,Tue Jul 21 15:52:32 2015 UTC,"Sounds like he has got great potential and all the talk at the moment is him being in the first team plans - even if it is around the fringes. Honestly, I hope he does the business sooner rather than later as our midfield is starting to look a little light (sweet jesus, when did a spurs fan ever think he'd say that?).  However, I think if he gets to play in the league early and doesn't do too well, we should give him the chance to be loaned out before the window closes. There are 4 games before the window closes after all."
coys,3e2oj5,Buffaluffasaurus,2,Tue Jul 21 14:48:09 2015 UTC,He's the signing I'm most excited to see this coming season.  Here's hoping he turns into the North London Pogba.

coys,3e2sou,friendlyguy2013,35,Tue Jul 21 14:56:14 2015 UTC,"Ok let's go through them.   Davies - lit a fire under rose, decent rotation and versatile.   Vorm - very useful and essential backup.   Stambouli -  gone.  Dier - brilliant rotational versatile defender,  young.   Yedlin - great athleticism and vision,  still needs positioning and experience. One for the future.   Alli - lit the 3rd tier alight at the age of 18. Should develop into a classy premier mid.   Trippier - proven PL right back  who fits our style and is young. Brilliant rotation player can push for first team.   Wimmer - young but capable centre back  we will see.   Alderwiered - proven PL and international CB for the first team .   All of these players who remain (save Vorm,  barring a travesty) have the potential to push for first team places."

They're smart signings, although maybe not sexy."
coys,3e2sou,waffuls1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:39:25 2015 UTC,"I think they will help the squad.  First off, having capable backups will push players to work hard and strive for a first team place.  Just like how Davies made Rose the star left back he is, Trippier and  Wimmer will make Jan and Toby have to keep working hard.  Second, having good backups will give the starters a break during lesser matches.  In games against Bournemouth, Newcastle, and Europa fixtures, we can play these guys so that starters can rest.  They play PL football and stars get to rest.  It's a win/win.  Not saying your wrong but I think you underestimate what good depth brings to the table.  You aren't wrong, but I feel like"

We HAVE to buy the players they are buying now but two-three seasons younger,  and hope we don't miss. (we are doing pretty well so far)."
coys,3e2sou,Blubbey,7,Wed Jul 22 00:00:55 2015 UTC,"14/15:  Dier - main backup on the right and became the default with Jan by the end of the year and is only 21. Definite improvement.  Davies - generally solid, just so happened to have Rose jump a couple of levels. Compared to before? Definite upgrade as a backup (Naughton/Jan/Fryers) and almost certainly has improved Rose. Improvement.  Vorm - Friedel has retired, definite upgrade on someone who doesn't play any more. Generally quite good, although I'd take a 30 y/o Friedel over him.  Fazio - compared to Vlad/Kaboul? Yes an upgrade for third choice. Over Daws? Questionable, slight improvement. *Adding on to this he's potentially gone from third to 5th choice now, which is an upgrade. Not bad at all.  Yedlin - too little to go on. In a very difficult position being 22 and being behind a 24 (soon to be 25) and 25 y/o with Kyle Walker-Peters who's 18 who will soon be snapping at his heels.  Alli - too little to go on. If I were to go out on a limb, I'd say he's an upgrade compared to Paul/Stam/Cap and only being 19, he has many years ahead of him.  Stam - sold.  15/16:  Wimmer - potentially yes, according to Cologne supports on /r/soccer he had a very good year and was key to their defensive successes.  Trippier  - had a good/very good year last year in a side that was relegated. If Walker plays like last year a definite upgrade, if they push each other to improve a definite upgrade, if Walker improves a lot and makes Tripp the backup that's still an upgrade.   Alderweireld - upgrade."
coys,3e2sou,jerkidiot,3,Tue Jul 21 16:02:04 2015 UTC,"As an article pointed out yesterday, we gave up a staggering number of goals last year despite finishing 5th and the clear objective going into this summer was to build the back line. Adding depth is a part of that process and now we have plenty of it."
coys,3e2sou,BanterDTD,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:14:00 2015 UTC,"Adding depth is a part of that process and now we have plenty of it.   Depth that Poch can trust, will help us out a ton when our fixtures get a little congested. Being able to throw in Dier, Wimmer, Trippier or Davies in for Euro League games will help a ton."
coys,3e2sou,jerkidiot,0,Tue Jul 21 18:49:49 2015 UTC,We bought 6 defensive players last year so that clearly failed. Why not get Alderweireld last season instead of Fazio? Why bother going for Yedlin when he is going to be loaned out and might not be ready for another 2 seasons?
coys,3e2sou,jerkidiot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:11:31 2015 UTC,"What failed? All the defensive additions under Poch have either been solid or havent played yet. Its not as simple as saying ""why didnt we just buy X player instead of Y"", because there could be a variety of reasons, maybe he wasn't a target at that time (also coming off injury prior to joining Southampton I believe).   As for Yedlin...hes young and new to the premier league, loans are part of the process."
coys,3e2sou,jerkidiot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:28:19 2015 UTC,Signing the players to improve our defence failed.   Yedlin is 22 so not that young. Not that big an age gap between him and Trippier and Walker.
coys,3e2sou,nrolo24,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:35:28 2015 UTC,How can they have failed when half of them haven't even played? And the age gap doesnt mean as much as skill gap for Yedlin at this point. I want him to do well but I think we also have to look at the possibility that he may not be able to cut it for a while.
coys,3e2sou,NotConor419,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:44:42 2015 UTC,"If you sign players to make the defence better but they have no impact or make it worse, that is a failure."
coys,3e2sou,Panencephalitis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:49:37 2015 UTC,But Dier Fazio and Davies have been good individually and they do make us better? This isn't ultimate team lol you don't get immediate results.
coys,3e2sou,NotConor419,2,Tue Jul 21 20:58:13 2015 UTC,"I would say Fazio has been dodgy and Davies hasn't impressed.  If you say results aren't immediate, then that goes against signing 3 more players instead of letting the previous ones bed in."
coys,3e2sou,NatrolleonBonaparte,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:06:06 2015 UTC,"Fazio has been dodgy. But he is now our 5th choice CB instead of that being Kaboul who was just awful.  Davies wasn't making any TOTS but he is a solid sub where we don't lose much defensively in place of Rose.   Dier is a great young player with a bright future. And if he had to be put in it would not hurt us.  Yedlin has brought in fans already which has an impact past on the field. As a project it is worth the purchase for that alone.  It's really simple, if members of our Starting XI fall off this year we will say we didn't do enough in this window. If everyone continues to perform and improve our biggest out cry will be things like ""Trippier has a great game he deserves to start"" or ""I can't believe Alli is only 19, he and Bentaleb are going to be monsters together"""

coys,3e2sou,Panencephalitis,5,Tue Jul 21 21:48:46 2015 UTC,"Alderweireld should bring a noticeable benefit to the team, for the first time in ages we'll have a legitimately quality centre-back pairing, but also his presence should give Vertonghen a boost as they've played together in the past.  Dier was a great signing and will really come into fruition within a few years.   Davies provided much needed depth for the LB role, he is a very necessary player.  With Freidel resigning, and Lloris recently getting an injury. it's quite obvious why we signed Vorm.  Yedlin & Dele Ali are your classic Spurs low risk signings, even if they don't work out we'll sell them at profit.  Fazio was always a poor signing, I don't know why people were excited about a slow centre-back with attitude problems, but when I pointed this out I got downvoted. He was gambled to be just as good as Musacchio, he wasn't.  Stambouli just didn't make sense at all.    Whilst it's true our starting XI hasn't changed much,  you have to bear in mind that outside of the CM role and arguably the right wing, our squad is very very good. A high quality CM to go alongside Bentaleb legitimately feels like the last piece of the puzzle."
coys,3e2sou,EriCOYS,13,Tue Jul 21 14:59:27 2015 UTC,"Do you think Paulinho was that last piece of the puzzle?  Also that stuff about Fazio is bullshit. He was the captain of a Europa league winner and by all accounts was a beast in the air. We weren't buying him for his pace. I think you probably got downvoted because you're a walking dillhole, not because of your opinion of Fazio."
coys,3e2sou,EriCOYS,-8,Tue Jul 21 16:05:10 2015 UTC,Paulinho Bentaleb partnership IMO should have been developed and would have ended up really good.  Yet you were wrong about Fazio and we signed another CB so...?
coys,3e2sou,EriCOYS,9,Tue Jul 21 16:08:09 2015 UTC,People here are starting to tolerate you again...let Paulinho go.
coys,3e2sou,Blubbey,3,Tue Jul 21 17:01:29 2015 UTC,Paulinho is a joke. There's a reason he's in China now.
coys,3e2sou,Blubbey,3,Tue Jul 21 18:09:25 2015 UTC,I was wrong? I didn't sign him. You are a bitter son of a gun.
coys,3e2sou,Blubbey,2,Tue Jul 21 18:47:38 2015 UTC,"I think they most definitely have improved us.  Fazio, even with his limitations brings experience. Toby should finally give us a nailed down, week-in-week-out CB pairing with Jan. I'd be surprised if Trippier doesn't become our starting right back a few weeks in. Dier and Wimmer have high ceilings and give us some depth at CB. Yedlin is one for the future. Vorm provides cover. Alli should challenge Mason for a starting spot and has potential to be a great coup for us. I like Davies, he improved Rose, but I think he could be a valuable asset in his own right if given more game time."
coys,3e2sou,EriCOYS,5,Tue Jul 21 15:19:19 2015 UTC,TL;DR: yes.
coys,3e2sou,MSU1X,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:23:43 2015 UTC,Did we need 2 right backs and 4 centre backs? Yedlin isn't a teenager and still might not be ready for another couple of seasons. Alli will not be challenging to start this season. Dawson/Kaboul would have provided experience and depth. They were good enough to be at least 3rd/4th/5th choice defender. Has Davies really been better than BAE? Stambouli obviously hasn't worked out.
coys,3e2sou,EriCOYS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:53:32 2015 UTC,"Depends if you consider Yedlin a RB. He seems to be seen as more of an attacking player until he learns some defensive awareness. Based off of Walker's injuries and performances last year, Trippier was a necessity. As for the four center backs, yeah, we did need them as the rest of our center backs were good enough (Vlad, Dawson, Kaboul). Having 5 center backs, three experienced CBs and two young CBs with potential is great due to our fixture congestion."
coys,3e2sou,EriCOYS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:24:30 2015 UTC,Yedlin is primarily a right back. Dawson and Kaboul are better than Fazio and good enough to be squad players. Wimmer has only had one year top flight experience. We have Dier already with potential. Another inexperienced centre back wasn't a priority.
coys,3e2sou,EriCOYS,2,Tue Jul 21 18:12:53 2015 UTC,Kaboul are better than Fazio    Did you watch Kaboul last year? Only good game was vs Arsenal. Yeah Faz had his problems but Kaboom ain't what he was.
coys,3e2sou,The1KrisRoB,2,Tue Jul 21 18:20:13 2015 UTC,I'm not a huge fan of Kaboul but he'll do for 4th/5th choice. Fazio made awful mistakes that cost goals against Chelsea and Fiorentina. Also picked up 2 red cards. One of his strengths is supposed to be being good in the air but he was useless against Benteke.
coys,3e2sou,nrolo24,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:25:40 2015 UTC,"Good thing Faz will be 4th/5th choice then this year. He was already behind Dier and Jan, he will be behind Toby and I have a suspicion he'll be behind Wimmer too."
coys,3e2sou,combatjohnny,2,Tue Jul 21 18:32:34 2015 UTC,"Hence, the transfers not improving the team but just shuffling the squad players."

As for Alli, he may be inexperienced but seems to be around the first team in training. We'll have to wait and see with him. Kaboul was a problem in the locker room. BAE wasn't even good enough for QPR and had attitude problems as well, much prefer Davies. Dawson would've been nice to keep around but I think he wanted first team, not to rot on the bench."
coys,3e2sou,entSC,-1,Tue Jul 21 17:28:59 2015 UTC,Don't several of the kids train with the first team during summer?  BAE was good enough to play for us in the Champions League and for Cameroon in the world cup. Davies has had little impact.

coys,3e1u3t,waffuls1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:54:22 2015 UTC,Pato's a bit shit and has not been scoring against big teams. Ganso is the one you'd want --- Neymar's partner in goals. Ganso wants out. http://www.lancenet.com.br/minuto/Ganso-Luis-Fabiano-Paulo-abacaxi_0_1397260430.html
coys,3e1u3t,ronaldo119,2,Tue Jul 21 16:57:28 2015 UTC,I heard that Ganso had also been shit ever since leaving Santos though.
coys,3e1u3t,briankelllly,3,Tue Jul 21 17:20:28 2015 UTC,"I think you're mistaken. He's being offered to midtable PL clubs, surely they're not gonna be paying him that money and I don't see many teams willing to take a chance on him that would be able to pay him a ton."
coys,3e1u3t,waffuls1,4,Tue Jul 21 12:24:42 2015 UTC,that's nearly a goal in 50% of his games IIRC
coys,3e1u3t,flancresty,5,Tue Jul 21 12:41:17 2015 UTC,That's practically a goal every other game.
coys,3e1u3t,nrolo24,5,Tue Jul 21 12:46:38 2015 UTC,He scores in about half his matches.
coys,3e1u3t,TheSmellOfSilence,4,Tue Jul 21 13:03:11 2015 UTC,Approximately .5 goals per match
coys,3e1u3t,p_gascoigne,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:53:00 2015 UTC,"From what I was told, he underperformed in all of the big games. His goalscoring record may look good on paper, but when you consider that most of these goals were scored against the bottom half of the table, it starts to become less impressive. Also, I'm pretty sure he scored at least one hat-trick against a very weak team, so it is definitely not 1 in 2. Regardless, I would still like to get Pato. I always had a soft spot for him, especially when he played for Milan. In addition, the small glimpse of hope that he'll go back to being one of the most dangerous strikers on the planet is also somewhat encouraging."
coys,3e1u3t,Doomchicken7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:51:11 2015 UTC,He is on relatively small wages. 35k GBP a week or so.

If he did, he would be the best, by far, paid player in Brazil.  EDIT: Wikipedia seems to agree with you, I trusted google.  EDITII: Then, again, the article wikipedia cites says nothing about his salary.  EITIII: Apparently he is only on 35K, but he is suing Corinthians to keep paying him while he is at Sao Paolo.

coys,3e1u3t,AndySEO,0,Tue Jul 21 15:20:00 2015 UTC,I feel like it is a gamble we need to take and he is still only 25 so he has a long time to get to his full potential. Personally I feel it would be a great signing.
coys,3e1u3t,smokey815,5,Tue Jul 21 08:50:58 2015 UTC,"With all his,injuries, fitness would be a massive worry. Don't think we can afford to pay the wages he'd command on a player who may not stay healthy, and who has a questionable work rate even when fit."

Like we kinda did with Ade a few years back?"
coys,3e1u3t,Smash_Brothers,2,Tue Jul 21 11:36:57 2015 UTC,"He's been playing well enough in Brazil. 1 in 2 record, and reportedly looking rather comfortable out on the left. I'm not worried about injury so much as I am an inability to get up to the fitness levels required due to significant muscle/ligament injuries. Also, I've seen his work rate questioned a lot. I like him and want to see him do well, I just don't know if he's a fit. Would be awesome if he was."
coys,3e1u3t,smokey815,2,Tue Jul 21 11:52:33 2015 UTC,"No! He FAILED badly at Corinthians. Spent a whole season whining. No moral fibre, stay well clear.   These goals are from the State championship. Darren Bent could be  top scorer FFS."

First, for those who don't know Inter sold Sandro to Tottenham, which started my relationship with this great club. Damião was also a Inter player, and thank God we dodged that bullet. Pato was also a Inter player before being sold to Milan, and was a huge talent.   About this potential move, I'd honestly love it. I truly believe he'll be Brazil NT striker for 2018. He's getting played, and is fucking shit up, he's good, young and I bet would do great things for us.   Also, he's getting payed 800k reais per MONTH. That is about £160k, or 40k per week.

coys,3e1u3t,mmeo92,4,Tue Jul 21 10:34:02 2015 UTC,"Not wanted because of wages apparently, I feel like his last major injury was 2013 and our fitness team could make him a worker if he believes in what we are doing as a club"

I went to the NLD at WHL this year through them without any issues. They sell you a package that will include tickets and a hotel room.

With more consistency and a steady approach and system, I'm sure we can see some improvement, whether it be marginal or drastic."
coys,3e03eq,Koinfamous2,11,Mon Jul 20 22:49:29 2015 UTC,Dembele played his best football last year when he played in the middle of the 3. If he plays in the cm 2 then things become far too slow and stagnant. I hope (and expect) not too many appearances in the cm pairing unless the game required it from time to time.   It still leaves our cm spot exposed. Mason and bentaleb will have to continue to step up. Alli reports frpm training have been very promising but actual prem appearances will be different.  The after that a few more youngsters with even less playing experience.   McCarthy aint going to happen cheaply and i just cant for the life of me see it happening so the cm will have to be found elsewhere.
coys,3e03eq,TheDrunkyMonkey,15,Mon Jul 20 23:04:24 2015 UTC,"I love some Mousa.  When he's on his game, he does things no one else on the team can do.  My main concern is with his durability at this point.  He just can't seem to play more than 60 minutes ever since his hip problem years ago."
coys,3e03eq,thenutter,9,Mon Jul 20 23:10:54 2015 UTC,"I don't mind the idea of him only playing either 60 or so minutes and then being replaced by Mason, or vice-versa coming on as a defensive move later in a game."
coys,3e03eq,D-Reezy,6,Tue Jul 21 00:44:17 2015 UTC,"Dembele has all the ability and athleticism in the world.  His issue as far as getting into the team seems to be more about his approach and tendencies.  If a year and a full preseason have helped him fit into his role a bit better, I think he'd be a more than functional member of the team.  Which would be awesome, because I love him."
coys,3e03eq,smokey815,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:54:23 2015 UTC,"Athleticism? Not so sure about that. He's really super-strong on the ball, but lacks a bit of acceleration and is really quite slow when it comes to tracking back."
coys,3e03eq,WindyCOYS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:51:17 2015 UTC,"Mason isnt really athletic in any sense, but Alli has the size and strength. I didn't mean pace."
coys,3e03eq,smokey815,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:59:15 2015 UTC,"Mason gets up and down the pitch well, but I agree. Alli - when fully developed physically - could be a really good athlete."
coys,3e03eq,WindyCOYS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:06:07 2015 UTC,"That's more along the lines I was thinking. Mason isn't immobile by any stretch, but he's nothing special. I think Alli is, and could be more."
coys,3e03eq,smokey815,4,Tue Jul 21 22:09:56 2015 UTC,"Moussa, in my view, played his best football last year as a number 10 in front of the midfield two behind the striker.   As a CM he has been very dissapointing his distribution has been very average (we all know he loves that sideways pass) and he is not as mobile or energetic as Bentaleb or Mason.  As a number 10 he gives us something extra, his ability to hold the ball and beat a player creates space and extra problem for defences. His limited ability to distribute isnt as  much of a problem becuase he has attacking players running off of him.  I dont think he should be starting every game but with a propoer rotation policy i think he gives a needed added element going forward"
coys,3e03eq,modernafrican,3,Tue Jul 21 06:26:53 2015 UTC,"Dembele was my favorite player the year after he signed from Fulham, but since then he hasn't looked like he has any idea how to play. I want to see him succeed, but he's been too inconsistent in the past for us not to go out and sign a reliable center mid."
coys,3e03eq,moojuuu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:52:15 2015 UTC,I think it's a case of there being several others players who other nothing or negative and Dembele is merely an under-performing decent player. He's lower down the list than several others so in the interest of stability we'll hang on to him for another year.
coys,3e03eq,_Sagacious_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:00:16 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling we'll get a surprise CM from Levy and poch coming in, but it won't be anybody on our radar at the moment. Hopefully he pairs well with bentaleb"
coys,3e03eq,naznazem,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:02:46 2015 UTC,"Almost every post in ""Who is your starting XI"" had Dembele w Bentelab. I'm not sure this has anything to do with Poch and more to do with fans not being keen on Mason's form to end the season and there being no suitable replacement. Unless his fitness has been an extreme focus this offseason I have a tough time seeing him be able to be a long term solution there, he always seemed better in the 10 slot to me."
coys,3e03eq,ltlistenerftposter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:47:53 2015 UTC,"I guess I'll play the voice of the opposition on this one...  I find Dembele incredibly frustrating to watch. I hope he can up his game but to me he has some serious short-fallings.  He never releases the ball on time, rarely spots a decent thru ball opportunity, and barely covers any ground when he's on the ball. In short he pretty much kills any attacking momentum that we may be attempting to build.  I think the only reason we're not looking to replace him right now is that there's a disconnect between defence and midfield due to us playing so high up the pitch. So maybe Poch is thinking he might be able to bridge that gap while we look for a defensive minded CM. But if the plan is for him to carry on in the role he's been playing in so far I don't want him anywhere near the 1st team."
coys,3e03eq,cloud4197,2,Tue Jul 21 12:08:36 2015 UTC,"That's exactly how I see him.  Has his uses, but is never going to be a regular starter.  If we get a bid of £10m+ we should take it."
coys,3e03eq,WindyCOYS,0,Tue Jul 21 19:49:55 2015 UTC,"I was just rewatching the home leg of the NLD again the other day... Dembele was fantastic. There's still a very good player in there, we just haven't seen it much over the last couple of seasons."

coys,3dy3fr,smokey815,5,Mon Jul 20 20:46:34 2015 UTC,Does anyone here think we should keep Lennon? Is he just surplus?
coys,3dy3fr,JohnMulroy,10,Mon Jul 20 14:14:13 2015 UTC,"during the cup final at half time i remember thinking, 'fuck, i wish we had Lennon on the bench' he still has something to offer, we should only sell him if we get a suitable replacement in"
coys,3dy3fr,smokey815,5,Mon Jul 20 14:21:33 2015 UTC,"I think Lennon is generally viewed as surplus with Townsend becoming a first team regular. While, in his prime, Lennon provided a more incisive final pass than Townsend has, the former has always been a poor shot whereas Townsend has shown signs of having a decent eye for goal (even though he has had a fair number of row Z shots). Both offer similar physical attributes.  Now, Lennon is nearing the end of his prime physically (pace always being his top quality) while Townsend is just starting to enter his playing peak (I think he could continue to improve his crossing and eye for goal). Thus, Lennon is surplus with no more potential to unearth or refine with. He is a good player still in the league, but I think any time he gets would be time that Townsend could have to invest in his future development (not mentioning Lamela at all in this discussion since people mostly point to Townsend as the reason that Lennon is on the way out)."

coys,3dy3fr,mappsy91,5,Mon Jul 20 14:31:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he does a job as a 2nd choice winger or whatever and when hes on form hes actually a pretty decent player.

coys,3dwayk,armstad,5,Mon Jul 20 04:53:18 2015 UTC,This is one of those movies you can love but can't explain why. It's just so damn good :)
coys,3dwayk,SoSpursy,3,Mon Jul 20 12:31:06 2015 UTC,haha nice. good catch
coys,3dwayk,PAVAL_DATSACK,4,Mon Jul 20 02:15:37 2015 UTC,Absolutely based movie. Had me more engaged than most films. Obviously perfect line about Spurs as well. :)

coys,3dx9it,wisedustin,12,Mon Jul 20 08:08:00 2015 UTC,I love this kit apparently no one else does!
coys,3dx9it,SirMothy,4,Mon Jul 20 14:03:46 2015 UTC,I do.
coys,3dx9it,kozeljko,2,Mon Jul 20 15:27:10 2015 UTC,I love it. It's complete and utter class in person. I think by the end of the season it will be one of the kits people talk about for years like the Jester kit.
coys,3dx9it,ltlistenerftposter,6,Mon Jul 20 17:27:23 2015 UTC,It has definitely been growing on me. Looks great on the players.
coys,3dx9it,lilywhite10,3,Mon Jul 20 10:58:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah was a little worried when I saw the leak, but no problems with how it actually looks. UA have slowly stepped their game up."
coys,3dx9it,LiamSpurs,5,Mon Jul 20 13:25:41 2015 UTC,I think it's a kit which might look fine when you see it being worn by ten professional football players.   But everyone else could potentially look like a bit of a twunt wearing it.
coys,3dx9it,davedubya,5,Mon Jul 20 15:18:27 2015 UTC,"Interesting to note the Purple shirts on the rack as Kane walks by, I know our training tops are that kinda purple, but can't see them bringin training shirts to the kit launch shoot, 3rd kit purple?"

coys,3dvps9,Skrong,-1,Mon Jul 20 06:06:09 2015 UTC,If true we need to get another DM in asap. Also it's a bit worrying that this was one of Poch's signings that didnt even last a year.
coys,3dvps9,AnAwfullyRealGun,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:54:57 2015 UTC,"People really need to stop labeling different transfer as ""Pochettino transfer"", ""Baldini transfer"" etc. We don't know how they decide things. Stambouli was a low risk gamble, it didn't work out and now we sold him for a profit, win win.  We don't need another ""DM"" asap, we might need a one before the window is shut. We still have Bentaleb, Mason, Alli, Dembélé, Carroll and Veljkovic to play in midfield before the window shuts. I would obviously like us to sign a good midfielder to partner Bentaleb but it's not like we are in the shit if we don't."
coys,3dvps9,superradwalkman,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:58:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think the Bentaleb-Mason midfield is strong enough defensively, we saw that many times last season."
coys,3dvps9,AnAwfullyRealGun,3,Mon Jul 20 13:01:56 2015 UTC,What a fresh observation.
coys,3dvps9,superradwalkman,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:10:23 2015 UTC,It's really not worrying.  We signed a low risk player in the hope he would help to take us to the next level. We've realised he hasn't so have sold him before his market value has dropped (although bizarrely his market value has risen)
coys,3dvps9,harpofburma,2,Mon Jul 20 08:43:58 2015 UTC,"But it wasn't just about him not being good enough, he didn't even fit in with Poch's high pressing system. Same with Fazio.  You'd think they would be able to see that beforehand. But the other guy who replied to me is right, they were both last minute desperation signings. Hopefully we avoid those this time."
coys,3dvps9,AnAwfullyRealGun,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:25:47 2015 UTC,"The thing is. Last season we didn't sign a single 1st team player. We signed depth as it was essential and then Poch evaluated the squad fully and we allowed a longer adaption period for youth and the 7 signings.   I think you're looking at the Benji signing wrong. It was a low risk transfer where we sign a player in the hope they will work, if they don't you sell them before the value, like I said.   Fazio I think still offers something to the back line, Cb is also notoriously harder to adapt to.   It seems mental to view 2 signings as a suggestion 'they' can't pick good players, especially when we have signed Paul Mitchell since then.  Stambouli wasn't a bad signing, we've made money off him and he offered us squad depth.   I really like the fact Poch is seemingly showing that he would rather work with a smaller squad and isn't particularly interested in the almost guys that have littered our squad for 3 seasons."
coys,3dvps9,harpofburma,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:06:51 2015 UTC,"When it comes to the CM situation, I assume the manager's either seen something in the guys we already have available, or they've got a transfer lined up to fill that hole.  They've had a solid transfer period so far, making purchases according to what looks like a coherent plan, so I choose to believe they're in control of the situation.   Also it's a bit worrying that this was one of Poch's signings that didnt even last a year.   Stambouli really looked like a last minute, because-we-could-not-get-who-we-really-wanted kind of signing, though.  Fazio was the same, hence our buying two new CBs early this summer.  Add to that the fact that Pochettino knows infinitely more about the squad, its strengths and weaknesses now than he did a year ago, I'm not worried yet."
coys,3dvps9,apathosaurus,35,Mon Jul 20 08:20:09 2015 UTC,He wasn't part of the seven...we bought him last year and the seven were bought two years ago...

coys,3dv3qt,xBastiannn,6,Sun Jul 19 19:45:58 2015 UTC,"Quick background here.   I've been a fairly serious FIFA player for about four years or so, and that is due to the ultimate team feature. It's almost the only game mode I play so I invest a lot of time into it. One cool feature is being able to track your cards from year-to-year, and I've done so with Spurs. I've created close to the best team possible (the best if I exclude FIFA 11). I think it's fun to look at the turnover from the years, and figured you might as well.  Edit: Just realized that Robbie Keane and Dos Santos' IF cards in FIFA 11 were actually with West Ham & Racing Santander,  not Spurs, my bad!  Also here is the FIFA 11 team"
coys,3dv3qt,hargrovefistblaster,3,Sun Jul 19 19:41:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I kind of went all out  Edit: Ignore the manager, I used to have Poch for my main squad, still don't have him for my Spurs one."
coys,3dv3qt,Blackwolf1981,5,Sun Jul 19 23:48:32 2015 UTC,Does your team and do your players transfer over to the new fifa games? I.e. will my fifa 15 ultimate team transfer over to fifa 16?
coys,3dv3qt,Blackwolf1981,7,Sun Jul 19 20:18:04 2015 UTC,Unfortunately not. You start from scratch each year.

coys,3du614,TheChosenJuan99,41,Sun Jul 19 14:34:42 2015 UTC,"If he'll agree to a bit of a wage drop, and we offload Adebayor, then this would be an incredible signing."
coys,3du614,NatrolleonBonaparte,10,Sun Jul 19 15:25:08 2015 UTC,Completely agree. With his PL experience I don't see how this could not help us this season.
coys,3du614,lilywhite10,5,Sun Jul 19 17:05:18 2015 UTC,"Yes. We need to not just concede fewer goals, but also to score more. To expect Kane to have as many goals as he did last season might be asking a bit much.. he needs a more lively partner.  It's tough to see Chicharito coming to be a super sub, though, so where would he fit in order to get the playing time to attract him? Along/under Kane in a 4-4-2? I'm having a hard time fitting Eriksen, Kane and Chicha into a 4-3-3 or a 4-2-3-1 given our wing play.  Thoughts?"
coys,3du614,htown2,9,Sun Jul 19 18:42:18 2015 UTC,"Just because he's #2 doesn't mean he won't play. I think his role would be more than just a super sub. God forbid Kane goes down, then he would play a lot. But other than that he could be our cup striker, with appearances in the Prem probably more often than we think."
coys,3du614,NatrolleonBonaparte,24,Sun Jul 19 19:00:39 2015 UTC,"I'd rather have Berahino to be honest. He's more useful across more positions (can play as the left-sided goalscorer we've been wanting to compete with Chadli in addition to as a backup for Kane), and he'll undoubtedly come on lower wages than Hernandez, while having significantly more resale value (assuming 5 year deals for either, Chicharito will be 30 by the time he has two years left on his deal, while Berahino would still be under 25)."
coys,3du614,waffuls1,7,Sun Jul 19 16:03:38 2015 UTC,"Your points are all valid, but I'm sick of always thinking about resale value. I loved the Soldado signing because it wasn't about resale value, it was about moving for a top drawer striker in his prime regardless of what the club could make from a future sale. It obviously hasn't turned out well, but I don't think the idea was bad."
coys,3du614,SHPKG,34,Mon Jul 20 14:08:35 2015 UTC,"I seriously doubt we will sign someone with that high of wages, who in the past has a reputation for wanting to be the #1 striker and complaining when he isnt. I just dont see it happening lads."
coys,3du614,JohnMulroy,19,Sun Jul 19 14:37:28 2015 UTC,I really can't see anyone in Europe being interested in paying him 100k a week. It is puzzling that Manchester Utd. offered a back-up striker so much.
coys,3du614,p_gascoigne,9,Sun Jul 19 14:45:09 2015 UTC,"So then he'll have to take a pay cut, or go to MLS."
coys,3du614,NatrolleonBonaparte,6,Sun Jul 19 15:40:55 2015 UTC,Loads of people don't want him going to the mls but I think he would be amazing for doing so. Proper signing to push the league forward and make it something more than just a retirement league.
coys,3du614,AtLeastImCooler,3,Sun Jul 19 15:48:20 2015 UTC,"Who doesn't want him going to MLS? As a supporter of MLS he would be a great signing for the league, even though there is no chance he signs with my team.  Edit: I thought he meant that people inside MLS didn't want him coming."
coys,3du614,NatrolleonBonaparte,11,Sun Jul 19 15:52:29 2015 UTC,All us Mexican fans and everyone that believes he can still play at a decent sized European club.
coys,3du614,BoogerHD,3,Sun Jul 19 15:53:55 2015 UTC,"Yes of course, I thought he meant that people inside MLS didn't want him. I agree with you that he can still play in Europe, that's why we should go out and sign him."
coys,3du614,NatrolleonBonaparte,5,Sun Jul 19 15:59:58 2015 UTC,"Mexicans, mostly. I'd agree with them, it'll be better for him to be at a good European club getting first team minutes, but MLS is probably the better option to sitting on the bench all year again."
coys,3du614,waffuls1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:00:30 2015 UTC,"Probably fans of chicharito to be honest.  As an MLS supporter, I love when new talent comes. But at the same time, I wish players that I think highly of and aren't elderly (like Bradley, for example) would play in Europe."
coys,3du614,doctorfunkerton,3,Sun Jul 19 16:31:48 2015 UTC,He should wait a year and then come play for MN united in their inaugural season next year!
coys,3du614,DefoeForPresident,2,Sun Jul 19 16:02:06 2015 UTC,We play soo many games though. And if he became unhappy we could just sell him to MLS literally whenever. They are dying to have him.
coys,3du614,NatrolleonBonaparte,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:39:44 2015 UTC,its a big risk. Remember Ade? Big wages that seem to go against our standard recruiting philosophy havent turned out great.

coys,3du614,JohnMulroy,6,Mon Jul 20 10:20:59 2015 UTC,"Google translation edited to become slightly more logical:    After a good season with Real Madrid, short on titles but full of goals such as the one in the quarterfinals of the Champions League against Atletico Madrid, Javier Hernandez has left Spain to return to Manchester United. Now England could remain his home, although - perhaps - with a mesh size different from that of the Red Devils: in fact, Chicharito is the interest of Tottenham and Mauricio Pochettino, who seeks the right reinforcement for his attack.  At the moment it is just an idea and the team of London is not the only one to follow the profile of Mexican born in 1988. One has to beat off competition from other clubs, and United does not have the need sell the player. After the departure of Robin Van Persie, in fact, the team of Van Gaal no longer has great alternatives. However, Hernandez could be in the middle of some important negotiation in the coming weeks."
coys,3du614,BoogerHD,8,Sun Jul 19 14:41:40 2015 UTC,Jesus Christ please. If we offload one of Adebayor or Soldado this would be perfect.
coys,3du614,tfw13579,-7,Sun Jul 19 15:51:57 2015 UTC,"No it would be terrible. Chicharito has spent the past few years on the bench, he has been shit for his national team, he's really done nothing good. How can people not see that?"
coys,3du614,BoogerHD,2,Sun Jul 19 18:03:52 2015 UTC,Lmao what? Sure he's been on the bench a couple of years but he's been on the bench of Manchester United and fucking Real Madrid. Truth is if he comes he could displace Kane as starting striker.
coys,3du614,roorahree,10,Sun Jul 19 18:29:21 2015 UTC,"I don't buy that last part. Even if he came, zero chance Kane isn't starting. Maybe he gets swapped in as the starter from time to time to give Kane a rest, but he isn't going to be the main starter."
coys,3du614,BoogerHD,2,Sun Jul 19 18:34:57 2015 UTC,What if Kane truly is a one season wonder though? Or just not performing up to the standards we need? Or gets injured? As good as Harry was this past season we have no clue if he can replicate that form whereas Hernandez has pretty much produced good seasons since his move to United.
coys,3du614,roorahree,3,Sun Jul 19 18:39:30 2015 UTC,"I feel like Hernandez was given more opportunities than Kane though. I mean, you raise good points about getting injured or not performing as well next season, but Harry didn't really get much of a chance until Poch came. I think it's a bit unfair to label Kane as a potential one season wonder before this upcoming season has even started."
coys,3du614,BoogerHD,2,Sun Jul 19 18:50:09 2015 UTC,I understand that it's unfair and I hope to god Harry is the striker he seems to be. But taking a gamble on keeping Harry as first choice and not bringing someone in that can challenge him for that first team spot can prove rather costly.
coys,3du614,roorahree,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:05:27 2015 UTC,"I think if Poch is comfortable with Kane as the undisputed starter then it's good for me as well. I don't see it as a gamble to be honest. The bigger gamble would be to not bring in anyone to serve as a back up or to keep Soldado and Adebayour (assuming Ade  doesn't move anywhere which would be a mistake on Spurs part). I'm just not in the habit of tabbing good, young players as one season wonders. I'll say that once they start sucking."
coys,3du614,tfw13579,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:17:46 2015 UTC,If we were getting the Chicharito from 2010 then that would be fine. Truth is he hasn't been that good since 2011. He scored 23 goals for Mexico in 2010 and 2011. He has scored 17 since then. I don't care who he's played for. If he's not playing and not scoring against subpar concacaaf competition then what do you have to show that he could bench Kane?
coys,3du614,Roshambo2110,2,Sun Jul 19 18:41:39 2015 UTC,"Di Marzio is no different to any of the other wind up merchants on Twitter.  That said, why on earth would we buy a player like Hernandez? We already have a penalty box player in Soldado, and we can already see he doesn't fit our system.   He would be very well advised to take the offer from MLS where the large latino population will make him even more of a superstar"
coys,3du614,NatrolleonBonaparte,10,Sun Jul 19 15:22:18 2015 UTC,"Di Marzio is more reputable than your average twitter account, especially when it's involving an Italian player or team. Just because this doesn't, doesn't mean he's totally wrong."
coys,3du614,smellysk,9,Sun Jul 19 15:40:33 2015 UTC,"Di Marzio is no different to any of the other wind up merchants on Twitter.   Completely untrue, the man is spot on 90% of the time...."
coys,3du614,nssmuckers,3,Sun Jul 19 15:41:28 2015 UTC,He is spot on when it involves Italian football.
coys,3du614,couplingrhino,3,Sun Jul 19 17:39:51 2015 UTC,"Soldado doesn't suck because he doesn't fir our system, he's shit because even two metres in front of open goal he still can't hit the back of the net."
coys,3du614,Roshambo2110,-1,Sun Jul 19 18:38:04 2015 UTC,"I don't believe I said Soldado ""sucked""?"
coys,3du614,BoogerHD,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:16:42 2015 UTC,Well Hernandez has pretty much proven himself in the premier league and has gone on and become a much better player from his time in Madrid.
coys,3du614,Roshambo2110,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:07:39 2015 UTC,Didn't he moan about how under-used he was at Madrid?
coys,3du614,BoogerHD,3,Sun Jul 19 16:11:08 2015 UTC,"He ""moaned"" about it afterwards. But in his defense he pretty much was underused. Real Madrid played a lot of games last season but apparently Ancelotti is Anti-rotation so he never really got the opportunities he thought he might've."
coys,3du614,john87000,2,Sun Jul 19 16:15:38 2015 UTC,Pochettino is Anti-rotation as well so this doesn't seem a good match.
coys,3du614,mrmunchkin62,4,Sun Jul 19 16:23:25 2015 UTC,Only anti rotation because he didn't trust anyone apart from his starting XI whatever transfers we have coming in this season will certainly be rotated
coys,3du614,busstopboxer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:48:45 2015 UTC,"He's rotated players very little at each of his previous positions too, that isn't going to suddenly change this year."

coys,3du614,pearloz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:44:27 2015 UTC,"Chicharito is a proven Prem scorer, tho.  And he had what 50 goals his first three seasons for United? That ain't bad."
coys,3du614,Roshambo2110,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:44:14 2015 UTC,"Still a very different player from what we needed and as we've seen with Soldado, just because a player scores a goal in one team, doesn't mean it'll happen in another.   My original point was that Hernandez was a penalty-box player, and that's not what we need."
coys,3du614,fcavada,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:29:36 2015 UTC,I love Chicharito but I can't see him going from the bench at Man United and Real Madrid to the bench at Spurs. He'd be a great fit behind Kane but it would be a better option for him to be starting at some other club.
coys,3du614,ltlistenerftposter,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:34:43 2015 UTC,I dont know if anyone else who watches him notices but he always has this weird distressed shocked look on his face
coys,3du614,theninjanipples,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:11:12 2015 UTC,"If he's willing to take a wage cut he would be absolutely perfect! The guy has only just turned 27; sure he isn't guaranteed a starting place, but similarly, Kane is guaranteed one either for the entire season.  Whilst I'm incredibly happy with Kane's progression and he will obviously start the season as first choice striker; there is so certainty that he will capture the same form as he did last season. That's not to say he will do poorly, rather, last season was so incredible that it will be very, very tough to match it. We should remember, the guy is very young. It might not be the best situation to expect him to play every single game in the league. He's still developing, and there's certainly a lot to be learnt; and Hernandez certainly wouldn't be a bad player to learn from, and possibly take over as first choice should Kane struggle for any reason.   I would actually love to see him starting quite a few games for us. I read somewhere that he has the fourth highest goals per minute ratio of any striker in the Premier Legaue era (I think it's around a goal every 118 minutes, which is frankly absurd). Surely a relatively big club would be foolish to not give him regular minutes and see if he can maintain that form. Last year in La Liga he was also up there, and I think he finished in the top five of goals per minute also.   I doubt he'll come to us, especially if we really are interested in Berahino. But you've got to think he would be a good acquisition. He's a proven PL striker, with experience at two massive clubs, one of which have possibly the worst fans in world football. He's proven to a be a perfect super sub. He's just hitting the prime years. He'd also be a relatively good option if we wanted to mix things up and play two strikers - him as a poacher, with Kane playing as a CF (where everyone expected him to play originally). I just don't really seeing him coming to a club like us."
coys,3du614,jonathaninho,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:39:19 2015 UTC,yes or berahino pls
coys,3du614,belbivdefoe,0,Mon Jul 20 02:18:10 2015 UTC,No thanks.  He's a poacher.  Can't create much.  Wouldn't work with the lack of delivery we get from the wings.
coys,3du614,WillSpur,6,Sun Jul 19 17:08:04 2015 UTC,"I honestly believe he has more to him than that but he's always been used as a super sub by united. I watch Madrid regularly and when they were hit by injuries and he was playing more I really liked what I saw of him. Besides, he's not going to take Kane's spot, sell Ade and replace with Chicarito? Hell yes."
coys,3du614,airz23s_coffee,2,Sun Jul 19 17:33:09 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you're getting downvoted.  I'll admit to not seeing tons of him, but most of his playing seems to be either getting on the shoulder of players or poaching, a.k.a what Soldado was famed for and was terrible for us because we don't play with that kinda striker."
coys,3du614,herzberz,0,Sun Jul 19 20:35:25 2015 UTC,"This is so funny because I was just thinking about this being a good look from Spurs.  It's tough because Harry has the 1 spot now and I think Cheech would only leave Real if was starting somewhere else.  Unless Poch decides to run two strikers, which he definitely won't, I don't think it would be a good value signing. edit:  I commented before I read the other comments, but now see the same thing has been said, I guess it's a popular sentiment."
coys,3du614,thedirkler,-1,Sun Jul 19 23:13:09 2015 UTC,"I think it's a little more likely then some are thinking (not saying it's going to happen by any means).  He'd almost definitely be taking a pay cut, but with Ade hopefully being sold that should free up a good amount of money, depending on how much we have to retain. He would be our guaranteed back-up striker, and even if he didn't start, would likely see a lot of time as a sub when we need a late goal or two (which isn't uncommon).  Obviously there's the MLS who could pay him what clubs in Europe do, but I can't see too many places if he wants to stay in Europe where he would be a main striker and still get wages reasonably close to what he's at right now.   Also it has the hallmarks of a Levy signing. In the same vein that Yedlin and Dempsey were signings in part to help grow our name in the states,  Chicharito would be a big name in Mexico."
coys,3du614,NYCsoccerfan,-5,Sun Jul 19 16:17:33 2015 UTC,"FFS go to MLS, be a regular starter and stop wasting your potential Chicharito. The last thing we want is another striker who gets benched and throws a fit."
coys,3du614,WillSpur,11,Sun Jul 19 17:36:59 2015 UTC,"""Go to the MLS"" and ""stop wasting your potential"" don't really go in the same sentence mate."
coys,3du614,NYCsoccerfan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:38:57 2015 UTC,"However people feel about MLS aside, playing in any league is more fulfilling of ones potential than being a backup.   Where's the glory in being loaned out from your club only to be bench elsewhere? Wasted potential."
coys,3dtpoj,Ryz999,56,Sun Jul 19 10:48:13 2015 UTC,I really feel for the guy. I mean yes he's hot and cold but he's had a shitton of personal stuff to deal with. I really hope he manages to get his family off his case and can spend the next 4-5 years playing his football somewhere where there's not much pressure on him. Seems like a nice bloke
coys,3dtpoj,xGrumbly,7,Sun Jul 19 11:06:38 2015 UTC,"He's a 31 year old striker. Unless you are World Class, most strikers don't even last that long. FYI he's the same age as Torres, and we all know how good he used to be. That doesn't mean people should reasonably think Torres is going to end up really good again. There will become a point where hot-and-cold becomes permanent cold. Is it really ridiculous to believe that he might actually be past it, and it might not just be a cold streak?"
coys,3dtpoj,Lambchops_Legion,17,Sun Jul 19 18:47:33 2015 UTC,He needs to stop giving them money. That's what half of his problems that he has with them is. He gives them money to better their lives and they spend it wastefully.

coys,3duccj,ericbq,13,Sun Jul 19 16:25:18 2015 UTC,"Purely playing devil's advocate here: because the club sells officially licensed shirts to retailers, buying from a retailer still gives revenue to the club."

Think about this then....if the club didn't use retailers, their reach and therefore market is much smaller. More retailers = more sales. If the club only sold through their website, they lose all foreign buyers, and all impulse and planned purchases in standalone retail shops."

I ordered a GK shirt from World Soccer Shop last year and it was a legitimate shirt. You can always buy right from Under Armour but I don't think they do names on the shirt if you want that. Most retailers outside of the official shop rarely carry third shirts. I love keeper shirts and I've noticed that away keeper shirts are also usually found only in the official store.

coys,3duccj,VikingswithK,3,Mon Jul 20 03:26:25 2015 UTC,"He deserves a 'better' squad number but I'd love to see him stay as 42. But as soon as they release his number and the third kit, I'm getting one."
coys,3duccj,Panencephalitis,2,Mon Jul 20 04:00:07 2015 UTC,"If I got it I'd say Kane, Eriksen, Dier, or the classic ledley King."
coys,3duccj,stpau1y,-1,Mon Jul 20 04:58:46 2015 UTC,Subsidesports.com is always the cheapest. They're consistently $5-$10 cheaper than other sites. Wait for a free shipping promo and you're good.   Edit: huh? Why the down vote? Lmao
coys,3dtej9,NatrolleonBonaparte,27,Sun Jul 19 07:24:27 2015 UTC,"Don't get why people are so down on him. He would basically be the perfect signing for us; Young, can play up top or on the wing, can play off of Kane, pacey, he'll fit right in to the role we need. Shouldn't be that expensive, either, after everything that happened last year."
coys,3dtej9,sickgrof,12,Sun Jul 19 12:04:59 2015 UTC,"As a player I'm content to sign someone who ticks all those boxes. I'm not usually one to complain about attitudes. But for whatever reason I'm not a huge fan of signing Berahino. Thing is, we haven't exactly got a massive list of other options. If we sign him up, that leaves CM as the only glaring hole to fill. We've got Pritchard and Lennon if we're short on the wings, and I honestly don't see us selling both Ade and Soldado without bringing in one more forward. We'd be about sorted. For a decent price, sign me up.   Also, it would be fucking nice to have such a big chunk the U21 squad just hanging around in out team."
coys,3dtej9,smokey815,11,Sun Jul 19 13:33:16 2015 UTC,"It also seems very apparent to me that his attitude problems were as result of his agent. He was a 20 year old kid and his agent had gotten him his contract. It's almost like a father figure, you have complete trust in that person. I think he was just following some really shitty advice, and I think him dropping his agent confirms that."
coys,3dtej9,sickgrof,10,Sun Jul 19 13:47:17 2015 UTC,"Bang on mate. Seems like SB saw how the perception of Sterling was changing based on his behaviour, which was surely encouraged by his agent. Thought ""fuck this, I'm not going down that road""."
coys,3dtej9,badguysenator,4,Sun Jul 19 14:28:07 2015 UTC,"I don't see how it's very apparent to anyone that is the case. I'd like to assume the best though, which is why I'm more or less content with the signing."
coys,3dtej9,smokey815,3,Sun Jul 19 14:55:11 2015 UTC,Because he fired his agent. I think that makes it as apparent as is possible in this situation.
coys,3dtej9,sickgrof,4,Sun Jul 19 15:14:18 2015 UTC,"It makes nothing apparent. He could have felt what you think, he could have felt his agent didn't have his best career, financial, or personal welfare high enough on his priority list. He might have not liked the guy, or gotten a better offer. There's no reason to assume any one of those over the other."
coys,3dtej9,smokey815,2,Sun Jul 19 15:47:36 2015 UTC,"But he hasn't had any issues since he fired his agent, despite him wanting out during the season and the transfer window now being open."
coys,3dtej9,sickgrof,15,Sun Jul 19 17:04:08 2015 UTC,if he has kicked his attitude problems as well as his shite agent then bring him in. Cant help but draw comparisions to a young Defoe
coys,3dtej9,its_your_boy,6,Sun Jul 19 08:18:33 2015 UTC,"Whenever I've watched him I think ""Defoe"" -- would be a decent signing in my view if the price is right."
coys,3dtej9,kaleidoscopic82,7,Sun Jul 19 08:22:35 2015 UTC,Tell Ings we'll take him back instead. Now that he's the 5th striker option over at Liverpool.
coys,3dtej9,Santidreet,19,Sun Jul 19 10:24:56 2015 UTC,"I may be slightly biased but how on earth does Ings think Liverpool is a sensible move at this stage in his career? Sturridge is coming back; Benteke is having a medical; They bought Firminio; Origi is back from loan; Not to mention Balotelli, Lambert and Borini. Does he think he's good enough to make a solid claim for a starting spot? Is he?  He could've been in direct competition with Kane at the lane... Not as if he's going there for the trophies either."
coys,3dtej9,normannb,10,Sun Jul 19 12:25:28 2015 UTC,Of course he thinks he's good enough for a starting spot he's a professional footballer
coys,3dtej9,ltlistenerftposter,3,Sun Jul 19 12:34:07 2015 UTC,I understand believing in your abilities yadda yadda but I think he needs a healthy dose of realism. Don't think he is any where near the level of Sturridge or the current level and potential of Benteke.
coys,3dtej9,AtLeastImCooler,4,Sun Jul 19 13:17:12 2015 UTC,"He probably didn't know Benteke was coming. I doubt Liverpool went to sign him and then said, by this way, you'll probably be fourth choice. I'm sure most clubs lie and assure the player that they will have chances even if it isn't really the case."
coys,3dtej9,theninjanipples,2,Sun Jul 19 14:09:40 2015 UTC,That's why you (And I) aren't professional footballers. You have to remember to get to this level even the fourth choice guys were always the best on their squad for their whole life. I'm sure if you ask Danny Ings privately he wouldn't say he thinks Benteke has more potential and skill than him and I'm sure he believes it.
coys,3dtej9,ltlistenerftposter,3,Sun Jul 19 14:53:30 2015 UTC,"He's easily above Lambert, Borini, and Balo at this point I'd say. Originally too, more than likely. Leaving a very easily broken Sturbridge and Benteke in a club that likes to run two forwards. I still don't see how he thinks that gives him a better chance to play, but it's not as bad as all that."
coys,3dtej9,smokey815,2,Sun Jul 19 13:35:12 2015 UTC,"Although your autocorrect switched 'Origi' to 'Originally', it still makes sense."
coys,3dtej9,hovAdov,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:49:37 2015 UTC,"He will be third option, as far as I know Firmino isn't really a striker and he is definitely ahead of Origi. Also, the same thing that's said every time this happens, more money."
coys,3dtej9,SuperSaiyanNoob,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:26:21 2015 UTC,We'll take Lambert then..or Borini..or Balo?

coys,3dtej9,SirMothy,14,Sun Jul 19 17:17:21 2015 UTC,"call it player prejudice or not, don't quite fancy him."
coys,3dtej9,tachyon_matrix,42,Sun Jul 19 08:38:29 2015 UTC,That's a bit playerist mate.
coys,3dtej9,Pretentious_Nazi,2,Sun Jul 19 08:53:38 2015 UTC,I think he will be a good signin.  He can play striker or on the wing.
coys,3dtej9,TheKingChadwick,4,Sun Jul 19 09:13:37 2015 UTC,"On paper, a Beharino Kane front 2 would be amazing. You've got one target man who can bring the ball down, shield it and make space for the runner. They could complement each other brilliantly!"
coys,3dtej9,normannb,8,Sun Jul 19 12:27:03 2015 UTC,"Even better than on paper, they frequently played well together for England U21s. Kane up front and Berahino from the left."
coys,3dtej9,badguysenator,5,Sun Jul 19 13:11:09 2015 UTC,"Thing is, I think Kane is too good at everything else to get turned into a mouth breathing version of Andy Carroll. And we shouldn't be playing two forwards."
coys,3dtej9,smokey815,2,Sun Jul 19 13:35:58 2015 UTC,"Not all the time, sure, but it's good to have two forwards who link together well as an option."
coys,3dtej9,crazyguitarman,2,Sun Jul 19 17:47:50 2015 UTC,"I really don't fancy a player who thinks he's too big for a club in the Premier League, he embrace it for the privilege it is and that he agitated for a move shows a lack of judgement. If he didn't have attitude problems after one good half season and just got on with playing properly and paying respect to West Brom's fans he would have probably got a move this summer anyway. That he seemed to be in a strop about not being able to leave is disrespectful to their fans and there is no guarantee he'd not take the same attitude with us one day."
coys,3dtej9,BuzzsawBrennan,4,Sun Jul 19 10:41:03 2015 UTC,Pulis said something along the lines of he wished he had Kane's attitude

coys,3duwc9,BoogerHD,25,Sun Jul 19 18:35:53 2015 UTC,"Berahino. I don't care if he's a cunt, he is a great player."

coys,3duwc9,DrBongo,8,Sun Jul 19 23:35:46 2015 UTC,"Ideally someone young and quick to compliment Kane's abilities. While it's unlikely anyone would be able to take Kane's starting spot, we need a striker good enough to lead us in Europa/domestic cups."
coys,3duwc9,Swish28,5,Sun Jul 19 19:21:12 2015 UTC,"Regardless, the new striker should do both. Why bring in a striker to play second fiddle who does not want to play and be a starter? What kind of motivated professional would that be? We want someone just as young and hungry as Harry. Not that Harry needs more motivation and competition, but just the nature of it is healthy for the club. It makes everyone work and push that little bit harder to get the best possible results. If you're a professional and you want to sit on the bench and collect your paychecks, your name is Emmanuel Adebayor.... And we don't need another one."
coys,3duwc9,Koinfamous2,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:05:38 2015 UTC,Soldado is doing the same
coys,3duwc9,SirMothy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:19:07 2015 UTC,"Depending on what Soldado is actually on, I'm not too worried about throwing him out the door. If we could only get a buyer for one, I'd sell Ade first with no hesitation."
coys,3duwc9,smokey815,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:55:05 2015 UTC,Ade has had a much better time with us but is unreliable attitude wise. Soldado has had a torrent time but at least he seems to care.
coys,3duwc9,SirMothy,2,Mon Jul 20 17:38:36 2015 UTC,"Ideally we would like somebody that can compete with Kane but I don't expect any forwards we can afford being able to overtake Kane as our starter, assuming he stays in form.  I would like us to find a pacy, young player that can run onto balls, as we have no through ball targets on our team. Also being able to play out left and give Chadli competition would be great, kill 2 birds with one stone.  If we can get lucky and get rid of Ade and Soldado then I would love for us to pick up a bruiser forward as well, but I think pace is a more pressing concern. Ideally this would be more of a veteran that can play target man and just play one or two touch with tap-ins or layoffs playing next to Kane."
coys,3duwc9,DoYouEvenSmurfBro,2,Sun Jul 19 19:22:48 2015 UTC,"In an ideal world we want to win every match we play in every competition. No matter how good Harry is he can't play every match, so yes we a backup, but we also need another striker that isn't just filling in for Kane, they need to be an outright talent that can lead from the front for the Europa and early cup matches.  Our defence is sorted, we have a solid first choice and a solid second choice for each position. Hopefully with Pritchard, alli and a few more signings coming in we'll have a solid first and second choice for the rest of the field as well.  We want to build a squad that can compete at the highest level possible for us given what's available, and then it just comes down to luck and Poch's tactical and player management. So for a striker I want someone that everyone considers first team quality and then leave him to battle Kane for the starting spot."
coys,3duwc9,barnetto2,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:55:55 2015 UTC,"Everyone's talking young pacy Defoe-clones here... Am I the only one who thinks we need someone in the Benteke/Drogba/Giroud/Lambert ""technically skilled big man"" mold?  Honestly, I hear everyone say we don't have any ""through ball targets"" but we have Nacer & Harry, both of whom are fast for their size & strength, as well as Andros & Yedlin who have bags of pace.  And finally; where is the space that these pacy players will run into? Teams have a tendency to pack the middle and sit deep against us, leaving us shooting from distance without anyone to really target with a cross. Harry is pretty good in the air, but he's better when he has someone to play off of.  I'd like to see us go after someone like Charlie Austin, someone who can provide an obvious target for crosses when teams want to sit deep and pack the middle against us."
coys,3duwc9,Sparklesnap,3,Sun Jul 19 21:19:16 2015 UTC,Townsend and Yedlin are near irrelevant to the conversation considering how little time they will get.
coys,3duwc9,TorontoHooligan,2,Mon Jul 20 00:35:40 2015 UTC,Thing is about Austin though is that he is one dimensional. Harry is our main man and will be for a long time to come - a new striker has to be able to play a number of different roles alongside Kane. I truly think Berahino would fit that mould whilst being able to be the main man when HK isn't playing.
coys,3duwc9,MattFilm,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:51:00 2015 UTC,"Ideally, you pick up someone young who can play with Kane, 2nd to Kane, and on the wing as well.  This is why guys like Hernandez and Berahino make so much sense-- both of them are able to come in and poach a goal late if needed, both can play a bit wider on the wing if needed, and both can play as a true striker, allowing Kane to drop back a little bit as well.    The flexibility going forward there is what makes them so attractive to me as prospective buys.  I think we basically could use one talented offensive player, and while these guys will probably fetch north of 20 million pounds, they are versatile and talented, so I think you get your money's worth."

In fact, despite only qualifying for the CL once, we're the 10th most valuable brand in football according to this: http://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-named-worlds-most-valuable-football-brand--with-arsenal-chelsea-and-tottenham-all-in-the-top-10-10304493.html"

In this respect, we are 6th in the EPL, according to your link and OP. The margin of difference is significant, it's not just the ranking. Also, I don't think 'Brand Value' necessarily tells the whole picture.    It's a relative term, I think we are big if considering all of Europe equally, we attract great players but we aren't big boys in the EPL, we are doing well with what we have."

We don't have the finances to really top the other top Prem sides in terms of wages. And we likely won't unless we get taken over or become CL regulars. Kind of hard to break into the top 4 until you break into the top four, basically."
coys,3dwxdc,CyclopsRock,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:53:21 2015 UTC,"It's not really a ""problem"".  To use an example: Manchester United was a liked and respected club in the 90s because much of the spine of their club were young talents nurtured and developed.   For genuine football fans it is far more exciting to see players like Ryan Giggs or Paul Scholes develop into great players than it is to endure LVG spend several hundred millions on hit-and-miss super stars."
coys,3dwxdc,TheHenandtheSheep,3,Mon Jul 20 12:25:21 2015 UTC,"Yup, agreed. Of course, the difference there is that as Giggs and Scholes developed, Man Utd could afford to pay them more and more to stay. The worrying aspect for me is that whilst we may well continue to develop great young talent, will we ever have a ""settled"" team like Utd did (though I appreciate that was an entirely unique set of players). There's no real version of reality in qhich we could have held onto Modric and Bale when they got big - and as long as that's the case, we're basically relying on the goodwill of players (ie Kane) to stay. I'd love it if Kane becomes to us what Gerrard was to Pool or Terry is to Chelsea, and it may well happen, but that's one player. All the rest will want to fly the nest when they get good enough.  That's why it'd be nice if we could funnel less money into transfers and more into wages - but even that doesn't account for our lack of CL football. IMO we need to get in there for a few seasons, so the prospect of us being a CL is never a wild dream. Even if we then fall out of it for a season or two, we should be able to hold on to our best."

Sure it would kick a couple of million into their pockets over the season but that is hardly going to be the difference between them signing a world class striker and going on to win titles.

He's a good header of the ball.  Ousted: This guy had the golden globe glove last year, and has been great this year too. He recently saved 2 penalties in 1 match unfortunately for my Red bulls.  Giovinco: He's been the best player this year. If they did MVP in the middle of the season, he'd be the undoubted choice. He recently scored a 9 minute hat trick and assisted the other goal scorer.

The guy is electric, and probably the best winger in MLS by far. It's a fun game to watch defenders guess whether he's gonna knock it past them and just outrun them, or if he decides to slow it down and kill you with a skill move.   The Dallas faithful are awfully afraid of losing him to Europe in the next year or two."
coys,3ds0oa,im_not_your_bro_bro,8,Mon Jul 20 16:25:51 2015 UTC,I Just hope that nobody gets hurt
coys,3ds0oa,harpooned_whale,13,Sun Jul 19 02:38:00 2015 UTC,Very nervous about this game. Last year the all-stars treated the game super serious and there was some very heavy tackling in the game. Similar sort of tackling and commitment you would expect to see in an FA Cup final or something.  I would say there's a much more serious risk of injury in this game then your typical pre-season friendly. Game means little to us but to them it seems to be a very big deal.
coys,3ds0oa,i-spye,7,Sun Jul 19 01:39:20 2015 UTC,"That's the risk European clubs take when they sign up to play the MLS All-Star team and that's why MLS fans like myself have been clamoring for the league to go back to a East vs West game. I know the ASG is just a money-maker for the league, but at the end of the day its a lose-lose on the field. If the All-Stars win, its because their opponent is in pre-season and they didn't care. If the European club wins, its because MLS sucks.  I'm a fan of both teams so I'm just looking for an entertaining game and hoping nobody gets hurt."
coys,3ds0oa,LDGoals,5,Sun Jul 19 14:09:56 2015 UTC,There's definitely a disconnect there. As somebody who doesn't follow MLS at all if you give me a choice between winning the ASG 4-0 and getting an injury to a first team player or losing 4-0 but coming away injury free. I would pick the second option all day long. It's a week before the United game!
coys,3ds0oa,i-spye,2,Sun Jul 19 14:21:30 2015 UTC,"Well even the most aggressive challenge of the game last season only nipped up Schweinsteiger for a wee bit, I think we'll be okay.   At least Hugo couldn't get hurt :( :( :("

Obviously I played with him at Tottenham for a few years and then again at Portsmouth.  “He’s a top player and a top professional.  “He was Spurs captain and he is a leader on the pitch. Physically he’s so strong, I think he’s a player who has got everything and I think he’ll do really well at Sunderland.  “Younes is a winner and a natural leader on the pitch and he’ll come to the club and bring that attitude – he’s a great signing for us.  “Even in training he was always going for it, running, tackling, heading, attacking – fans will love what he’ll bring to the team.”"

So they get every other game for say 30% decrease in price. Also a live feed to a park in Tottenham for £10 or something for those that can't get in.  Edit: Gutted to lose Pritchard.

You invest yourself emotionally, psycologically, even financially in a group whose endeavors you have no control over. Thus, you stake your emotions to the vagaries and unpredictability of life. You don't do this to only feel good, because that's not how life works. You do this to experience the full range of emotions--the bitterness and frustration and hollowness of defeat, the thrill and incandescent ecstacy of victory and triumph. It's this range of emotions that make the feelings all the more intense and the experience of sharing them with your community all the more worthwhile. I see no downsides to this at all. This is life. Spurs are life."

coys,3dr4mt,TheFogarty,4,Sat Jul 18 17:52:46 2015 UTC,"to me, it's because one of the teams slogan is ""The game is about glory."" That's why I support Tottenham. And to clarify, I'm not talking about winning silverware every season, but in playing a strong, attacking game. I like the high-risk, high-reward style that Spurs have in the DNA of the club. They bring in risks (Lamela immediately jumps to mind) that could pay off big time, and they run themselves soundly as a team. I don't feel like I have to worry about Joe Lewis having to sell the team to some Eastern European ex-Soviet cause the club is bankrupt. So that's why I support Spurs over say Manchester United or Chelsea"

coys,3dr4mt,briankelllly,25,Mon Jul 20 14:00:50 2015 UTC,"See, want to know why this makes you sound like such a fucking ignorant twat?  You say ""given all the Americans""-- not ""Given all the foreigners"" or even ""given all of the non-londoners"".  Then, you go on to defend your claim by saying that anyone who isn't geographically tied to the team is plastic, yet you single out Americans. This makes you sound like you just don't like the Americans, and rationalize that to yourself by calling them plastic.  FWIW-- a plastic fan by my definition is anyone who claims to support a team for reasons other than the football itself.  So, for example, I knew a kid in college that supported Arsenal because they were first up in Fifa and he ""couldn't be bothered to scroll"".  Literally never watched them play a game, but started talking shit to me as a spurs supporter because he was 'supposed to'.  I have a coworker who supports City because he liked their kit when he saw it on the rack at a sporting goods store-- it reminded him of Tar Heel blue (the UNC color).  He loves UNC, even though he went to a shitty public school in Virginia, because he's a shitty sports fan.  These people are plastic fans.  A fan who came to the team because of players on the team, and has continued to watch the team actually play/stay involved in the team's news, even through the ridiculous summer months, deserves to be praised as opposed to ostracized because he wasn't born in the right geographical location for your snobbery to approve of."
coys,3dr4mt,jester92800,16,Sat Jul 18 21:01:14 2015 UTC,"I think the reason someone decided to start following the team is less important than how they actually follow them.  Personally I started following Spurs in 06-07 because I played as the team on FIFA and got hooked. I watched as many games as I could then (which wasn't many because they weren't on TV much) until I got my first laptop and was able to watch games online (08-09).  Since 12-13 I've seen 90% of the matches, including 2 at the Lane. I own two jerseys (kits) and a hat.  Sure, I may have started following the team for trivial reasons, but in no way am I a ""plastic fan"". I can't fathom how someone who wakes up once a week before 8 simply to watch a match would be considered plastic. I'd like to hear the reasons why someone like me isn't a real fan, from you or anyone who feels otherwise (not sure you do and don't mean for this to sound like an attack, couldn't come up with a better wording)."

I always respect the US west coast fans who get up at 5am sometimes to watch games, but according to the guy I replied to, they're plastics because they're American.  I always find myself sticking up for American fans because I'm an odd sort of gray area, being from the UK (so I satisfy the geography ""requirement, but being a US citizen."
coys,3dr4mt,jester92800,2,Sun Jul 19 02:38:21 2015 UTC,"Fair point, I read yours more as the initial reason matters almost as much as their continued following, but I see what you are really trying to say."

I'm sure the likes of Danny Murphy and Helder Postiga attracted you. Oh wait, you probably saw that there was a team with a really good player (Bale) who wasn't part of the established top teams, but not complete shit, so like the demi-hipster you are you started to ""root"" for them."
coys,3dr4mt,whatsthedealwithsein,10,Sat Jul 18 21:17:15 2015 UTC,"I was born just north of white hart lane to two lifelong fans, and my favorite players are probably the likes of vdv and crouch, not that it matters in the least.  I moved to the U.S. at the age of two, but we tried to watch as much Spurs as possible as a kid. It was tough until 2008 or so when more premier league games started to get broadcast here, before that we had to wait for them to play United, arsenal, or Chelsea for them to show up as the Sunday/Monday game of the week on ESPN. Even as late as 2012, you often couldn't find our games on TV here-- nbc has changed that all allowing free access to all games through streaming services.  My point is that I will gladly stand here and argue that I have as much of a right to be a fan as you, geographically, I have as much dedication to the team as you do more than likely, and yet you think less of me because I am nominally an American. You just make yourself look like more of an arrogant cunt every time you open your mouth on this issue and it's an embarrassment."

I still watch them sometimes, still love to see them do well. Does the fact that I'm from the UK make me a plastic fan? A fan us someone that sticks with a team through thick and thin, regardless of whether they're born in Enfield, Pittsburg or Nairobi. A plastic fan is a glory hunting twat who abandons ship as soon as the team they are supporting starts doing badly (see Liverpool last season and Man Utd the season before and all of Chel53a).

coys,3dr4mt,pounro,24,Sat Jul 18 20:05:34 2015 UTC,"From a relatively new Spurs fan in the US:  For me, becoming a Spurs fan was a very strange thing.  I was born, raised, and live in San Francisco, CA and all of my sports allegiances were lifelong and natural--the Gians, the 49ers, the Warriors.  That is to say, I had no choice.  It never even occurred to me that one could choose which team they support--in a sense, we are all born into various fiefdoms and our loyalties are a birthright (or curse).  This is why I could never, ever understand frontrunners or bandwagoners or fair-weather fans who are somehow able to switch allegiances depending on which way the wind was blowing.  Such mercenaries can not, and should not ever be trusted.    And then about 8, 9 years ago, after a couple decades of merely watching World Cups, I decided to follow soccer in the in-between years.  Because of the common-ish language and being the top league, an EPL team was the natural choice.  But picking a team was anything but.    The only team names that I even recognized were United, Chelsea, Liverpool, and arsenal.  To me, that mean they were automatically eliminated.  In the US, across various sports, we have the equivalents of those clubs--teams that are so well-known and popular and draw fans that should have no affiliation with them on any level.  The Yankees, the Lakers, the Cowboys, etc.  From my experience with those types of fans, I knew the traditional Big 4 in the EPL would likely have the same.    Eventually, after some research, calculations, meditation, and alcohol, I decided on Spurs.  That they had a loose affiliation with my local MLS team, the San Jose Earthquakes, was the clincher.  However tangential, I need to have a local rooting interest.    That being said, I knew my support was contrived.  It happened unnaturally and it felt very weird.  I was supporting a team that I couldn't talk to anyone about (very few of my friends follow soccer, and none follow Spurs), a team that played thousands of miles away, a team with a culture of which I was not a part, a team that played on grounds that I had never visited, and so on and so forth.  It was entirely unlike my experience with my lifelong teams.  But I also knew that I couldn't switch.  I was stuck and so I stuck with it.    And I'm glad I did.  The cons of following Spurs are obvious.  Spurs are surprisingly the butt of many jokes.  Being ""Spursy"" is apparently a thing.  Spurs seem to be synonymous with mediocrity--never terrible, never great, always middling.  Spurs are known to be a selling club--they find and incubate great talent...and then sell them.  And the talent that they do buy are rarely, if ever, the big, big names.  Another strange con about being a Spurs fan: if you say you're a big club, you get laughed at.  Spurs aren't United or Barca or Bayern Munich or Juventus.  But if you try to play up the underdog status and say you're a small club, you're also laughed at.  Again, Spurs are in the middle.    But, to me, the pros far outweigh the cons.  There are no bandwagon Spurs fans.  Whenever people learn that I follow soccer, they will inevitably respond with ""Me too! Chelsea is sick!""  and I smile and say yeah, they're ok--I follow Tottenham.  Those who have never heard of Spurs quiet down and those who have look at me with a bemused face, wondering how did that ever happen?  For me, supporting a team that does not have casual observers saying ""Tottenham, woohoo!"" is a huge pro.    Another pro: I like to suffer.  It's not fun at the time, but in retrospect, that's what fandom is to me.  For the first half of my life, the 49ers won 5 Super Bowls.  I thought that's how it was always going to be.  But then it just...stopped.  And they became an irrelevant entity in the NFL for the next 15 years.  The Giants are probably the closest analog to Spurs, for me.  My entire life, they've had pretty good seasons, the rare almost great season, and so many average seasons.  And the Warriors, they were always shit.  Those years in the wilderness harden you.  You become chiseled into a real fan, unswayed, unmoved.  To me, to be a fan is to suffer.    And then the final pro: the hope.  The Giants won the World Series.  After years of mediocrity and heartbreak and heartburn, they won the World Series and San Francisco exploded.  We danced in the streets and we drank in the streets and then we burned the streets down.  And then they won the World Series again.  And they won it again.  Fans jumped on the bandwagon, yes.  And fuck it, they're welcome on as far as I'm concerned.  But for us, the ones who were always there, we knew what we had been through which is why it meant so much more for us.    And the Warriors.  After decades of quite possibly being literally the worse team in the NBA, caught lightning in a bottle this year and somehow lifted the trophy and put rings on their fingers.  We polished that turd and turned that motherfucker in a goddam diamond.    All those years of shaking our heads at the end of all those seasons, after all those years of talking about what pieces we needed to collect to get a winning squad out there, after all those years of losing but hoping had finally paid off.    Seventh, sixth, fifth place?  Yeah, I'll take it.  No one will ever accuse a Spurs fan of a being a gloryboy.  No one will ever accuse you of being too cute with your support of a League 1 club either.  It's middling, yes, but it's also within striking distance.  There's hope.    And when Spurs lift that trophy one day, I'll dance and drink in the streets of San Francisco alone if I have to, and then I'll burn it down.     COYS."

coys,3dqico,kaleidoscopic82,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:04:57 2015 UTC,"Sorry but it is perfectly reasonable and sensible suggestion. Rival teams share stadiums all the time, it would feel weird at first but we'd get used to it, and it is just for a year. Fans would stop breaking seats once the bill came.  Surely it is preferable to playing games outside London or getting into a bidding war with Chelsea, plus it would fit more fans in than a reduced capacity Wembley, I believe. Surely whole point is to let as many Spurs as possible see team during the year away.  Spurs fans, and especially the hysterical THST, need to get real, and accept it is going to be a weird and difficult year, but worthwhile for magnificent stadium we will get at end of it. If Emirates won't work, and Chelsea get Wembley, then Olympic Stadium is the next best option especially as it is taxpayer funded and West Ham just tenants"

As it is now The Scum and Tottenham have multiple home games at the same time. Would they have to rework the schedule? and or would this mean that we don't get as many ""home"" games?"
coys,3dqico,p_gascoigne,4,Sat Jul 18 15:02:02 2015 UTC,The scheduling is easy enough. The stadiums of teams like Everton and Liverpool are so close to one another they never play home-games at the same time. I believe it is the same with us and Arsenal.
coys,3dqico,DefoeForPresident,2,Sat Jul 18 15:21:40 2015 UTC,I honestly didn't know that.. Thanks for the information!
coys,3dqico,theYword,2,Sun Jul 19 00:47:26 2015 UTC,"The Scum and Tottenham have multiple home games at the same time   Actually the Met coordinates it so that this doesn't happen. It is exceptionally rare that Arsenal will play at home on the same day as Spurs. Same weekend possibly, but rarely if ever the same day."
coys,3dqico,AbstergoSupplier,2,Sat Jul 18 17:33:35 2015 UTC,Are other London teams taken into account for this? Or are the different transport lines separate enough for every team but Spurs and the scum?
coys,3dqico,rapidretina,2,Sun Jul 19 00:36:15 2015 UTC,In the PL the only pairs who cannot have home games on the same weekend are:  Liverpool/Everton  Arsenal/Spurs  City/United  Not sure about the FL teams.
coys,3dqico,theYword,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:17:40 2015 UTC,"It depends I think. If there is a London derby between Spurs and Chelsea at Stamford Bridge for example then I think they try and prevent Arsenal from playing at home that day. However normally, a Chelsea home fixture can be on the same day as a Spurs or Arsenal home fixture. With the smaller clubs there is also often attempts to avoid clashes, even with the lower leagues so that Chelsea and Fulham for example can't play at home at the same time."

coys,3dqovq,Munsain97,29,Sat Jul 18 15:11:29 2015 UTC,"I'm a FC Porto fan as well (being Portuguese and all), and I'd love to see Sérgio Oliveira here. Porto is packing its midfield with so much quality players (João Moutinho is being talked to return, cashed 20M€ (£14.2M) for Imbula, as well as 2 or 3 of the best Portuguese midfielders prospects of the League), it is very likely Oliveira won't play much. Which is a shame, coming from our youth system, signing a huge senior contract and finally fulfilling our expectations in the last U-21 European Championship. Many speak of William Carvalho bossing our midfield, but only because of Oliveira's back-up and glueing our style of play. He got substituted on the final and since then we couldn't quite dominate the game, ending losing the final on penalties. I think it would be the perfect partnership for Bentaleb, he's clearly a step ahead of Mason, trusting he maintains his U-21 form. Still, Porto's a tough club to negotiate, and I'm doubtful they'll let him go now that he's back from years of loan and buying priority at Paços de Ferreira."

coys,3dqovq,Blubbey,3,Sat Jul 18 15:29:19 2015 UTC,"Looked real deal in u21 euros, albeit alongside awesome midfield of William Carvalho and Bernard Silva... Looked a bit like Cabaye, but taller and more athletic.   Can't believe Porto would sell him to Spurs though, sure he is just after a new contract."
coys,3dqovq,kaleidoscopic82,3,Sat Jul 18 15:26:19 2015 UTC,Looked really good in U21 but I'd be lying if I said I didn't want to sign a more established midfielder. He'd be just as much of a crapshoot as our own midfield prospects.

Peterborough were physically bigger and dominated the game that way but technically we played well apart from a few lapses in defence. Personally thought Miller (8) and Goddard (10) (shirt numbers are correct, names I'm not so sure on..) did well centrally, and Azzaoui did very well when he came, but for me, most impressed with Veljkovic, confident, solid, and knew exactly what he was doing and what he needed to be doing at all times, no panic under pressure and never looked flustered/rushed like some of the others when put under a bit of pressure.  Will be at the Spurs XI vs Stevenage game in two weeks, and the two munich/audi cup games too, so looking forward to the rest of this preseason before the season kicks off!"

coys,3dq7ki,MrJDMTyte,16,Sat Jul 18 11:44:48 2015 UTC,Less I'd imagine as Stones has had two seasons as a stand out player for Everton. Dier has been played out of position quite often and people don't know as much about him. Kind of irrelevant anyway.
coys,3dq7ki,danfeen,4,Sat Jul 18 11:38:38 2015 UTC,"I'd say between like £10-18 million, but I doubt many teams would pay that yet. I think Dier is very good, but Stones is a cut above at the moment.   In my dreams, we'd sign Stones in a year or so and have that Dier-Stones partnership, which I feel could be a phenomenal national team partnership in like 6 years times if they develop as they have been.  Obviously never going to happen, but they're both so classy for centre backs, and the technical side of their games will only become better as they age."
coys,3dq7ki,theninjanipples,4,Sat Jul 18 11:48:47 2015 UTC,Stones-Dier is the stuff of my wildest dreams
coys,3dq7ki,caelan03,2,Sat Jul 18 12:00:26 2015 UTC,Stones-Dier & Jan-Toby would be 2 unreal CB pairings.
coys,3dq7ki,HoratioMG,4,Sat Jul 18 17:18:55 2015 UTC,"Nahh they're both right footers, better to have a lefty with a right footer, like Jan and Toby.  Let's see how good Wimmer is, and how Carters-Vickers develops over the next couple of seasons. Two big prospects."
coys,3dq7ki,sendmark,11,Sat Jul 18 12:01:32 2015 UTC,You're vastly overestimating the importance of left/right foot when playing as a centre back.
coys,3dq7ki,Blubbey,5,Sat Jul 18 12:23:02 2015 UTC,"Have you played there? Makes a surprisingly big difference, not as much as say left or right fullback, but for clearances and passing angles it's a big help to be on your strongest side."
coys,3dq7ki,sendmark,7,Sat Jul 18 12:41:47 2015 UTC,You're correct but if you are good enough/learn to play there enough it can be overcome. Maldini and Terry as a couple of examples.
coys,3dq7ki,Ru8,5,Sat Jul 18 14:02:02 2015 UTC,"Yep, played all across the back and have been moved up to left/right mid when needed, mostly on the left as a right footer. Inverted before it was cool."
coys,3dq7ki,Blubbey,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:55:23 2015 UTC,"That depends on a few things,  the main two being:  Firstly, how comfortable you are on your weak foot. Ledley was a great example of this, you could watch him for ninety minutes and still not know which foot he preferred.   Secondly, the style of CB you are, if you're not much or a passer anyway then it's less of an issue."
coys,3dq7ki,safaridiscoclub,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:14:25 2015 UTC,Some managers insists on always playing with a left- and right-footed CB pairing.
coys,3dq7ki,p_gascoigne,3,Sat Jul 18 15:48:50 2015 UTC,"As I said, it will never happen. But in all honesty, there's absolutely no reason why two centre backs with the same strong foot can't play next to each other. I'm not sure why people make such a big thing out of it.  Edit: I mean, the best English centre back pairing for a long time was Terry and Ferdinand - both right footers. And this year Cahill and Terry were probably the best partnership in the league, and I think they're both right footed."
coys,3dq7ki,theninjanipples,2,Sat Jul 18 12:12:51 2015 UTC,"It's only a problem when both players are particularly one-footed, and it becomes a weakness the opposition can use. If the CBs will only pass it with their right, the angle that the opposition needs to cover when pressing is slightly smaller.  Ferdinand was comfortable with both feet, as is Cahill.  It is an advantage to have both left-footed and right-footed players anywhere on the pitch.  LVG said just the other day he always plays with a left-footed CB."
coys,3dq7ki,p_gascoigne,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:10:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not disagreeing; it's certainly the ideal situation. But in the hypothetical situation I laid out, I'm sure one of either Stones or Dier would be comfortable enough to pass with their left foot. I mean, Jones is very good with the ball, so I'm sure this wouldn't be an issue for him."
coys,3dq7ki,theninjanipples,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:17:35 2015 UTC,"For the record Terry is actually very comfortable using his left, at least for the simple clearances he usually sticks to as a 'stopper'.   Again it's not decisive thing, but it certainly helps make a partnership stronger when they have a preference and are on the best side to use it. I'm confident you'll see that this season with Toby-Jan and Wimmer-Dier."
coys,3dq7ki,sendmark,2,Sat Jul 18 15:45:33 2015 UTC,Stones will go for more than that if he moves. Dier's probably worth about £15m at best

Dier will never attract that kind of interest, so his value won't be inflated to anywhere near that level."

coys,3dnewg,tacophagist,16,Fri Jul 17 18:09:56 2015 UTC,"This run is also in a time between stages in Europa League. There shouldn't be too many distractions, which should help us maximize our return from these matches."
coys,3dnewg,kinggareth,12,Fri Jul 17 18:23:59 2015 UTC,Right. I'm almost positive we'll cock it up somehow but this is going to be the meat of our run at 4th if we make one.
coys,3dnewg,krvv98,-16,Fri Jul 17 18:25:59 2015 UTC,"We won't get anywhere if our end goal is 4th. We need to set our goals higher. It's fucking annoying to hear us just wanting 4th. Even if that's realistically near our ceiling, we can't just be content with 4th."
coys,3dnewg,kde01,19,Fri Jul 17 19:32:45 2015 UTC,"Okay - say this out loud for me: ""next year we're going to win the league.""  If you said that without feeling depressed or laughing immediately after then maybe you need to dial down the optimism a bit.  There are 3 clubs that I can see being able to win the league at the moment. We're not one of them. We're not as strong as any of them. Getting 4th would be a coup and that should be our target.  Ideally I'd like to get a domestic cup, progress well in Europe, and get 4th in the league. Because that's where we are right now.  There's nothing wrong with being optimistic but you need to temper that a bit and bring it in line with reality."
coys,3dnewg,krvv98,-2,Fri Jul 17 20:26:35 2015 UTC,"I know we aren't going to win the league but outright saying the goal is to finish in fourth is dumb. Why not try higher? I'm not being overly optimistic, it's just annoying having everyone say the goal is to finish somewhere other than first."
coys,3dnewg,SnipeCity73,4,Fri Jul 17 21:06:19 2015 UTC,"Well, finishing fourth would be a step up, and finishing their for 3+ years in a row should give us the attraction of being a club who will get Champions League football, which along with the added revenue from CL football, would help us land good signings"
coys,3dnewg,krvv98,-1,Fri Jul 17 22:27:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah I get that it takes time, but I just don't like the settling mentality.   I may just be too used to American sports where the goal is championship or bust."
coys,3dnewg,Paw_In_My_Face,3,Fri Jul 17 23:40:25 2015 UTC,"But there is such a difference in parity in European soccer man. There is no salary cap. Oakland has no business ever challenging for a title, nor does Buffalo, or Tampa Bay (probably not the best 3 examples given their current state, but Oakland and Tampa had success in the early 2000's and Oakland historically is good). OKC has no business having two of the best players in the league. Cleveland having Lebron is insane if you think about it.   Our goal can't be championship or bust cause that's not what its about and its kind of impossible...the number of the games makes it so it is pretty impossible to go on a ""dream run"". But there There are multiple trophies to fight for where you can go on that run, and getting European soccer is a victory in its own right. Idk if you were around our champions league season, but it was a fucking dream.   The teams above of have so much money. Seriously just a fucking absurd absurd absurd amount of money. They throw it around like its nothing and can get whoever they want. I'm American so I am not trying to be some elitist who is gonna punch a whole in the wall when someone writes the Spurs, but try and get rid of you some of the preconceived notions about what being a sports fan should be, cause being a Spurs supporter is a bit different. And it makes it fun!"
coys,3dnewg,krvv98,4,Fri Jul 17 23:55:36 2015 UTC,I wouldn't be content with 4th. I'd be ecstatic. You need a reality check my friend.

coys,3dnj32,kinggareth,8,Fri Jul 17 20:21:43 2015 UTC,"Agreed, was concerned about his attitude but seems to have knuckled down and booting out Aidy Ward as agent is a good sign."

I think he's definitely the type of player we need...can play on the left or up front, presses well, and likes to twat the ball into the net like JD. We aren't getting Heung min-Son or Jay Rodriguez or anyone like that, so maybe he'd be a good compromise."

coys,3dnj32,sirjimmyjazz,13,Sat Jul 18 09:43:58 2015 UTC,"ive been agaisnt berahino ever since the first link to us. but im slowly coming around. The idea is to get a young attacking forward, and it looks like all our foreign options are washed up. At the end of the day he is a young talent with a proven PL scoring record, so while its not ideal because i think hes a piece of shit with an attitude problem plus there are better options out there, he may be just what we need."
coys,3dnj32,benoles_esquire,4,Fri Jul 17 18:47:56 2015 UTC,I'm for it if we don't way overpay because he's English.
coys,3dnj32,tabelz,2,Fri Jul 17 20:47:17 2015 UTC,"Given the prices quoted for the likes of Martial and Timo Werner, Berahino is looking good value."
coys,3dnj32,sendmark,5,Fri Jul 17 21:12:00 2015 UTC,"And rightly so. We are very interested in him and are continuing to pursue him. From what i am hearing it sounds like it'll drag on, but will happen.  As a player, not sure i want somebody of his attitude at spurs. But who knows, maybe that switch of agent was all what was needed.."
coys,3dnj32,TheDrunkyMonkey,6,Fri Jul 17 18:49:01 2015 UTC,The fact that there've been so few Berahino to Spurs rumors makes me think it will happen. (This logic sorta makes sense.)
coys,3dnj32,dirtyewok,6,Fri Jul 17 19:09:41 2015 UTC,Keep in mind he is also trying to get a new contract.  He supposedly ditched his agent (who is Sterling's agent) for a new group who could help get him a raise.  We could be in for him.... Or his agents may be trying to use us to muddy the waters in the media and put some pressure on the incoming owners

coys,3dlyxa,PointNPraise,9,Fri Jul 17 15:44:33 2015 UTC,I really hope this is true. I really want us to offload both Ade and Soldado and get another hungry young striker as backup and for EL/Cup matches.
coys,3dlyxa,rathey123,12,Fri Jul 17 10:24:21 2015 UTC,If we do offload them both are we not going to need two new strikers though? I know we only play one up top but i still think we need 3 strikers in the squad.
coys,3dlyxa,PointNPraise,6,Fri Jul 17 13:25:08 2015 UTC,You're right about that. But then we should probably get a really skilled striker and a very young prospect around 17-18 who can dip his toe during the seasons to come.
coys,3dlyxa,Paw_In_My_Face,9,Fri Jul 17 14:18:01 2015 UTC,really skilled striker   Who? They don't really exist for prices we are willing to pay. Look at how much Liverpool is spending on Benteke.

He'd be a integral backup IMO and worth a lot more than that for a season. Immense amount of experience we've been looking for, could replace Kane in case of injury, and obviously would be ideal for Werner if we managed signing him too.  We'd be foolish not to sign Klose but unfortunately he won't want to come here anyway."
coys,3dlyxa,OldWarrior,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:36:37 2015 UTC,"If my Football Manager save has taught me anything, it's that Klose would join us and be an effective backup to Kane. Just hope Levy doesn't make my mistake by allowing the contracts of all our strikers other than Kane expire in the third year and forgetting to land someone before the window closes. I'm down to Kane and the U-21s at striker. I think Levy is growing tired of me despite my champions league qualification in year two."
coys,3dlyxa,tim_rocks_hard,3,Fri Jul 17 17:58:37 2015 UTC,I have a sneaking suspicion Soldado isn't going anywhere.
coys,3dlyxa,Roshambo2110,6,Fri Jul 17 23:15:07 2015 UTC,"As much as I am in favour of shifting Ade (and Bobby Soldier) I'm a little concerned - we have no strikers at the club at any level aside from Kane who can in any way contribute to the 1st team. Obviously we should look to shift anyone who isn't contributing but we're going to need to bring someone in who isn't afraid to rotate with Kane, or to play back up to him."
coys,3dlyxa,mrmunchkin62,5,Fri Jul 17 10:47:59 2015 UTC,I can guarantee you if ade and soldado leave there is most definitely something going on behind the scenes to bring in another striker within a week of those two leaving
coys,3dlyxa,sickgrof,2,Fri Jul 17 12:29:05 2015 UTC,I always assummed we gambled on Ade and lost (a gamble i was never presonally in favour of) and as a result we need to shift Ade's massive wages before we can sign someone
coys,3dlyxa,swolbrah,5,Fri Jul 17 10:51:53 2015 UTC,"If we sell both Ade and Soldado, we would obviously buy a striker this summer. My money is on Saha."

coys,3dlyxa,smokey815,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:53:13 2015 UTC,Best Saha.
coys,3dlyxa,NotConor419,2,Fri Jul 17 14:57:01 2015 UTC,I don't think Pochettino plans on using him at all. He only ever made the bench because of injuries to Soldado as far as I can remember once the back half of the season came around. I don't think we can even consider him depth right now.
coys,3dlyxa,friendlyguy2013,5,Fri Jul 17 12:22:21 2015 UTC,Would work out nicely.  Liverpool waste 32.5m on yet another striker and we get to sell Adebayor.
coys,3dlyxa,TopScruffy,10,Fri Jul 17 10:30:47 2015 UTC,That's an interesting spin. Liverpool sign one of our targets who has been one of the top scorers in the Premier League over the past 3 seasons. I think only Aguero has scored more than him during that time.
coys,3dlyxa,friendlyguy2013,3,Fri Jul 17 13:59:18 2015 UTC,"""One of our targets"" before we had someone better. It's arguable at this point who's actually better on the pitch, but Kane is far and away better for Tottenham. And at this point there's no reason for Benteke to be a target of ours."
coys,3dlyxa,TopScruffy,4,Fri Jul 17 15:50:47 2015 UTC,We need more than one striker. Benteke was the one most people here wanted us to sign.
coys,3dlyxa,friendlyguy2013,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:04:46 2015 UTC,"Too expensive. Too good for second choice and would get disgruntled behind Kane. Value would go down if Kane stays in form and keeps Benteke on the bench, and subsequently Benteke would request a move.  We do need a striker capable of taking over if Kane gets injured, but Benteke is far beyond that. We'd only sign him now on a discount deal which is obviously not gonna happen. May as well celebrate the silver lining if this enables Ade to Villa."
coys,3dlyxa,You_Dont_Know_JackPo,2,Fri Jul 17 17:29:29 2015 UTC,Would have played Kane behind Benteke and given Eriksen a free role cutting in from the left.
coys,3dlyxa,friendlyguy2013,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:36:35 2015 UTC,Why shift our goalscorer away from goal?
coys,3dlyxa,TopScruffy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:53:43 2015 UTC,It's not like he would be in defence. He'd have more space with another striker for the opposition to focus on. Kane is not the fastest so running onto the ball from slightly deeper helps him get away from defenders.
coys,3dlyxa,friendlyguy2013,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:03:47 2015 UTC,"I'd be up for that last year but Kane is the man now. And he's damn good at being the man so I think it should stay that way. I do like Eriksen on the left though, I'd like us to try more of it with Lamela in the middle."
coys,3dlyxa,Lambchops_Legion,2,Fri Jul 17 17:41:10 2015 UTC,Kane will be marked more tightly this season. Having another striker up with him would help.   I do think Lamela would be better in the middle than out wide. He keeps cutting inside anyway.

coys,3dlsch,adokretz,19,Fri Jul 17 08:55:50 2015 UTC,but it's understandable that he'll want game time   Yeah that's not happening at PSG
coys,3dlsch,pandanomic,2,Fri Jul 17 09:38:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's not happening at PSG   PSG played 60 something games last year, so there should be opportunities.  There are also some murmurings Thiago Motta might be off as well which would make Stambouli their 4th choice MF"
coys,3dlsch,borensoren,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:44:44 2015 UTC,Probably not. He does look talented so maybe they will get the best out in him.
coys,3dlsch,adokretz,11,Fri Jul 17 09:41:20 2015 UTC,Also I imagine as a French player who's not had the best time at Spurs ever that PSG would be pretty hard to turn down
coys,3dlsch,mappsy91,4,Fri Jul 17 09:46:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah you can't really blame him, can you! Probably got higher wages as well."
coys,3dlsch,adokretz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:52:45 2015 UTC,He'll probably be used as a second half substitute to see out games.
coys,3dlsch,energyi,5,Fri Jul 17 18:41:08 2015 UTC,Good stuff. How much did we pay for him?
coys,3dlsch,PointNPraise,4,Fri Jul 17 10:20:13 2015 UTC,"£4.1M, according to transfermarkt. €8M converts to about  £5.6M."
coys,3dlsch,mickeybell3,5,Fri Jul 17 13:57:28 2015 UTC,I wouldn't be so quick to trust transfermarkt. That site tends to have very low figures for transfers compared to what's widely reported.

He also just turned 30: Meaning he will be looking for a final big contract if he is going anywhere.  So there is pretty much no chance Levy or Pochettino would be interested.
coys,3dqpw1,p_gascoigne,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:31:20 2015 UTC,Idk about that big contract. The guy could get a lot more money but went to Fiorentina so he could be in a new place and learn new things.

coys,3dmqug,smokey815,13,Fri Jul 17 15:21:31 2015 UTC,I would cry for joy if they end up being our pairing going forward. So much physicality in that midfield.

coys,3dqpfs,DefoeForPresident,22,Sat Jul 18 15:09:20 2015 UTC,"It's called depth. To answer your question, probably not. I'm not sure why the amount of left backs affects our right back either ?"
coys,3dqpfs,Panencephalitis,11,Sat Jul 18 15:14:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah this baffled me. ""We have two LB so does this mean one of our RB is leaving""."
coys,3dqpfs,WillSpur,14,Sat Jul 18 16:08:07 2015 UTC,"We've got three strikers, RB is looking crowded."
coys,3dqpfs,Stompy119,-5,Sat Jul 18 16:47:25 2015 UTC,"I was just trying to show that a majority of our defense is new to the team. Yedlin, Davies, Trip."
coys,3dqpfs,Panencephalitis,3,Sun Jul 19 00:45:56 2015 UTC,So? See: depth
coys,3dqpfs,bbqchxpizza,4,Sun Jul 19 02:38:31 2015 UTC,"Yedlin flat out isn't good enough yet, and maybe never will be, for first team football at a club with top four aspirations. Pretty tired of hearing about it. He needs at least a year loan at a promoted side or something like that before we even think about it."
coys,3dqpfs,p_gascoigne,10,Sun Jul 19 16:33:09 2015 UTC,"Yedlin is not playing PL football anytime soon, he doesn't even get to play for the U.S. national team as a right-back. If we get rid of Walker we have one right full-back...Trippier. He will only leave if we sign someone new."
coys,3dqpfs,jlacour,9,Sat Jul 18 15:27:14 2015 UTC,"We needed cover for Walker, that was why Trippier was signed. Walker has been pretty injury prone the past few years, so having a PL quality back-up is necessary, and if he ends up giving Kyle a run for the starting spot then even better. Yedlin probably (hopefully) will be loaned out so I can't see him being in the mix for starting RB. Walker definitely isn't going anywhere though, we finally have good depth in our defense"
coys,3dqpfs,Wisco7,6,Sat Jul 18 15:15:20 2015 UTC,"It's a possibility, but I don't see the point right now. He's one of the best players on the team and I can't imagine him getting a massive transfer fee."
coys,3dqpfs,Blubbey,3,Sat Jul 18 15:14:48 2015 UTC,"Why get rid of him? Apart from a year ago he's been relatively injury free, getting rid of him because of one year is a strange move especially considering that this would be his 5th full time year in the prem and he's generally quite good, although he does have problems. To get rid of him for a guy who's only 3 years younger with about 10 minutes experience in the same league is foolish.  If anything I would guess it means Yedlin's getting a loan unless of course there are serious injury concerns, that's the only way I can see him being gotten rid of."
coys,3dqpfs,TheDrunkyMonkey,2,Sat Jul 18 15:23:41 2015 UTC,Yedlin won't be used as a right back most of the time anyway. He'll be put into the right hand side of the forward three.   That leaves walker and trippier at rb and rose amd davies at left back. No need for any change here.  What is interesting however is what the long term plans are for fredericks.
coys,3djm9q,chocotacoman,58,Thu Jul 16 20:17:57 2015 UTC,"I know people think he's shit cause of last season and the attitude problems are probably legit, but he had some nice moments with us. Also, assuming Lennon's gone to Everton, we have no one left from our last CL campaign."
coys,3djm9q,thraser11,23,Thu Jul 16 20:26:35 2015 UTC,Walker was on loan but technically with Spurs at the time.
coys,3djm9q,Lou3000,16,Thu Jul 16 20:41:03 2015 UTC,"I feel like that's a stretch, because by that logic Kane, Townsend, Bentaleb, etc...were all part of that team since they were in the youth system at the time."
coys,3djm9q,brownieman2016,20,Thu Jul 16 21:49:48 2015 UTC,"Walker was on a professional contract.  But yeah, its a stretch."

coys,3djm9q,Wildcard35,9,Thu Jul 16 20:41:45 2015 UTC,11/12 was easily his best season though. I'd say only a couple of defenders in England were better.
coys,3djm9q,nssmuckers,5,Thu Jul 16 21:04:10 2015 UTC,He was definitely one of our best that year. Good luck Younes.

He deserves respect from the club and the fans even if his ability has deteriorated largely thanks to injuries.   Those of you who were around for 2011/2012 season will remember what a fucking beast he was at his best. He had that rare combination of size and athleticism which made him absolutely unbeatable in the air. He was the perfect partner for Ledley King for most of that wonderful season. If not for some serious injuries he could very well be our best CB still.

Obviously we don't know the exact fees but from what's been reported:  Toby was like 11.5, Trips was 3.5, Wimmer was 4.3, so that's 19.3m pounds spent.   Paulinho was 9.8, Capoue was 6.3, Younes is supposedly around 4, so that's about 20m earned."

Best of luck to him, I hope he's a rock for Sunderland (except when they play us).  EDIT: also, his injury was such a massive blow to the squad.  If he'd kept up his 11/12 form in 12/13, alongside Super Jan ... sigh ....  A few fewer goals might have seen us in 4th (we only finished 1 point behind)."

coys,3dmn59,TheFightingCock,13,Fri Jul 17 14:38:37 2015 UTC,"This article confused me a bit. Why was King the epitome of a flawed individual...was it because of his drinking problems or his injuries on the pitch? The former never seemed to affect how people viewed him or how he played and the latter, the argument was made that Kaboul could have still been a great captain even as he physically declined so I don't understand why the same applies to King.  This article also just wreaks of resentment towards Levy. Are people really still harping on him for not spending enough money, even after the summer of the Beatles, even though we clearly need to spend wisely due to the new stadium, just like Arsenal had to do for 5-6 years? And to say the one good thing ENIC has done is develop youth doesn't make sense. Our youth has become a factor only in this past year, and I understand that it has been developing for a bit, but prior to this, who was starting for us that came up from our academy? And regardless, there are many things ENIC has done that are worth applause...like the fact that under them we have done most consistently well since the 60's.    Scott Parker is an example of a bad captain? The guy might not have been the best player, but holy fuck did he run his heart out every single game. And by most accounts, Poch did not necessarily pick Kaboul but the players picked him.   Boxer in Animal Farm was a mindless brute who was anything but a leader...we need pigs not horses!"
coys,3dmn59,Paw_In_My_Face,4,Fri Jul 17 15:15:54 2015 UTC,"He also left out / ignored that Robbie Keane was a captain for us as well considering how rarely King played and he had the vice captaincy role. Honestly I think people overstate the importance of being captain, there are players who will be leaders no matter what, giving them or not giving them an armband won't change that.  That said there are players who will improve and take on responsibilities when they are captain and I think that is why Harry was given the band, and by all accounts he has quickly become one of the most vocal players in the dressing room whereas rumors suggest Hugo is fairly quiet off the pitch."
coys,3dmn59,itinerantmarshmallow,3,Fri Jul 17 15:47:11 2015 UTC,"true i did forget Robbie Keane.   Importance of a captain should never be overstated. Yes the cliche is true about needing a team of leaders, but without one to stand above them it's useless.   Every single great team has had a great leader. Every social, sporting, political event needs someone in charge."
coys,3dmn59,BardiTFC,4,Fri Jul 17 15:58:40 2015 UTC,"The youth team is a product of the club thinking long term, something they have failed to do on many occasions with the first team. Harry Kane isnt the result of one seasons work. The same with Mason and Bentaleb etc. Years have been poured into their development. The training ground, the coaches, the club invested wisely.   BTW the youth team has produced Luongo, Caulker, Townsend and a host of other players that litter the Championship.  The fault with King is we had a captain who couldn't play. The one man who mentally could do it couldn't physically.   No resentment towards Levy. Other than Stratford and StubHub, most of his decisions have been good ones financially, but he has failed us at critical points."
coys,3dmn59,BardiTFC,2,Fri Jul 17 15:56:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response...I appreciate the article. Something actually substantive to discuss rather than the ""why don't we get this player"" posts that have been on here a lot recently."

coys,3dmn59,jmoneygreen,5,Sun Jul 19 04:29:50 2015 UTC,"Lloris doesn't deserve the armband?  Dawson didnt?  Thems fighting words. Dawson is everything he said Kaboul should have been. Lloris is both a fantastic player and leader. The only thing he said that I agree with is that Nabil would be my pick for a future captain. But right now, our captain 100% deserves his role."
coys,3dmn59,smokey815,2,Fri Jul 17 16:17:37 2015 UTC,"Lloris is our best option for captain right now, but are you convinced he'll stay?   Kaboul pre injuries was a better player than Dawson at his peak. A fit pairing of King/Kaboul would have been special. Same with Woodgate.   Dawson had everything, but lacked the ability."
coys,3dmn59,BardiTFC,2,Fri Jul 17 16:34:18 2015 UTC,"Dawson was good enough to play, and had literally everything a captain needs. Hugo potentially leaving shouldn't play a part. His attitude is fantastic, as his his ability."
coys,3dmn59,smokey815,2,Fri Jul 17 18:17:08 2015 UTC,"To be fair, King has said on multiple occasions that Dawson was his favorite CB partner."
coys,3dmn59,MadArend,2,Fri Jul 17 18:39:10 2015 UTC,"Roy Keane had less ability than some players on United. Dawson was a fantastic captain IMO, he had the heart and the passion that was needed."
coys,3dmn59,itinerantmarshmallow,4,Fri Jul 17 17:12:29 2015 UTC,"I think Lloris makes a fantastic captain: he is one of the best at his position in the world, intelligent, a seasoned veteran, and wants to achieve great things with Spurs (he could have jumped ship for PSG multiple times the past couple years). Considering the massive amount of turnaround in the first-team, I think he may now be one of the most senior players (not including academy players). I do agree that Bentaleb could make a potentially fantastic captain in the future if his progression does not stall.  I would not hold it against Vertonghen and Lloris if they decided to part ways in favor of a Champion's League team (if we do not make it next season). Although the romantic in me thinks he is a Yid through-and-through, I would not be surprised if Bentaleb would move for better opportunities if he meets the high ceiling that his development has established. Yes, the King was undoubtedly the last great captain we have had. I can't speak for everyone, but in the back of my mind I can't help but feel that had he remained healthy he would have moved to a ""bigger"" club (casting bias aside).  I think Levy (and by extension the rest of the management) knows this. Even CL teams like the Scum lose their captains to bigger teams, but perhaps this is because their club's progress has stalled.   By announcing the new stadium plans, Spurs have announced their ambitions to the rest of the world. By revamping our defense and removing chaff, Spurs have announced their commitment to providing Vertonghen and Lloris with the best support possible. By allowing Pochettino to have final say in transfers, Levy has (finally) openly announced his long-term commitment to a manager. By signing Bentaleb to a long-term deal and pay increase, Spurs have announced their recognition of his insane work ethic and commitment to the team.   Call me a dreamer, but I think these moves (which have all taken place this window) are an indication that great things are about to happen at Spurs for the next five years. The captaincy is a side-issue in the grand scheme of things: if Spurs can meet their goals we will have our proper captain."

Also so used to just totally dominating teams you wonder how he'll do in a fairer league.  The barca players get a free kick every time an opposition breathes on them so another worry for me would be the massive difference in physicality in the leagues.  He's won everything, but you could easily argue that the barca team could have won them whether he was in the squad or not.  So all things considered - It's a gamble, could be good, could flop."

coys,3dji0d,raging_monkey_pit,6,Thu Jul 16 19:58:13 2015 UTC,Yeah they'd would be silly not to play him in Spain
coys,3dji0d,pounro,7,Thu Jul 16 20:30:58 2015 UTC,"Why would it have to be a team not competing in the Champions League? Surely, it's that he can't play in the Champions League because he intends to play for Barcelona in Champions League come the new year. So he should be able to join a Champions League side as long as he isn't registered in the squad named for the Champions League."
coys,3dji0d,bpmo,3,Thu Jul 16 20:15:29 2015 UTC,When do we take players on loan? Loans with option to buy notwithstanding
coys,3dji0d,alexropo,12,Thu Jul 16 20:04:43 2015 UTC,Only with players of exceptional quality... like Frazier Campbell.
coys,3dji0d,bornhowling,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:53:25 2015 UTC,"this is probably true. it's very unlikely for both parties to agree. at little off topic, but... loans without options to buy often seem to be seen as inefficient moves, but that should not always the case. courtois helped atletico win the league. there's not a single atletico fan who should regret that."
coys,3dji0d,mickeybell3,9,Fri Jul 17 04:12:52 2015 UTC,"I doubt it, leaving in January would be disruptive as hell."
coys,3dji0d,TheyDidItFirst,33,Thu Jul 16 19:59:36 2015 UTC,I'd deal with that in a heartbeat if it meant having a player of his class even for just a half season. I think its very unlikely though.
coys,3dji0d,fatguylilcoat_,4,Thu Jul 16 20:03:36 2015 UTC,"Who do we bench for turan? Chadli? Lamela? No. This move would be counter-productive. Let him be loaned out to a Spanish side, his wages are probably ridiculous anyway."
coys,3dji0d,Skrong,6,Fri Jul 17 04:59:01 2015 UTC,Literally anyone (bar Hugo obviously). He's way better than anyone in our squad.
coys,3dji0d,fatguylilcoat_,0,Fri Jul 17 05:42:51 2015 UTC,"so we play him instead of one of the two for six months and then ship him back to barcelona and expect to replace him with lamela or chadli? nope, dumbass move."
coys,3dji0d,Skrong,3,Fri Jul 17 07:42:05 2015 UTC,"Having him kill it for 6 months is better than betting on Lamela/Townsend/Pritch coming good, or Chadli/Eriksen recovering their early season form. How is that not obvious?"

coys,3dji0d,DeadZ23,3,Fri Jul 17 10:09:33 2015 UTC,"Still would be better for us long term to have the slowly improving Lamela progress for six months rather than bench him and let him play against FC Cyprus in the Europa League.  We won't get Arda on loan anyway, though."
coys,3dji0d,fatguylilcoat_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:02:35 2015 UTC,Right do fuck the players we have permanently let's bring in a guy for 6 months have him completely stifle any progress are players make and then send him back to barca so we can play the merry-go-round for the last half of the season. You're an idiot.
coys,3dji0d,melihs11,2,Fri Jul 17 14:00:08 2015 UTC,"Why? He'll take time to settle, and by the time he does he will be gone back to Spain. Then we are left chopping and changing again.   This would be absolutely pointless."
coys,3dji0d,SuperSaiyanNoob,2,Fri Jul 17 10:01:37 2015 UTC,I thought you had to register a player to loan them out and barca can't register any new players.

coys,3dmewu,benoles_esquire,4,Fri Jul 17 13:35:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, which means paying over the odds to get him. He's a good player but he's not 20 million pound good but that is the bare minimum it would take."

coys,3dmewu,CareOfCell44,4,Fri Jul 17 13:49:38 2015 UTC,"Hoping that ""over market value"" means letting Lennon stay there. From everything I've read, they rate him as a fanbase and Martinez appeared to favor him over other wingers currently on the team (at one point, I'm almost certain he was keeping Mirallas out for a fixture or two)."
coys,3dmewu,brokenairguitar,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:04:08 2015 UTC,They boughy Delfoueu so that spot is now filled probably.
coys,3dmewu,Your_Personal_Jesus,7,Sat Jul 18 14:51:14 2015 UTC,"FFS must we have a McCarthy discussion every few days? Purchasing him for any more than 12m would be an absolute waste of money. He is hardly any better than what we have. If we're going to spend >20m, we should go to a different league and purchase someone who would noticeably improve the team.   Any team who is willing to pay what Everton is asking for McCarthy or Stones are either playing with oil money or have lost their minds."
coys,3dmewu,chrish1023,3,Fri Jul 17 16:03:23 2015 UTC,"He was in contention for Player of the Year during the 13/14 season and last season he was easily their most consistent and best player in what was a pretty abysmal season for them, which makes it all the more impressive.  To say that he is ""hardly any better than what we have"" is a huge disservice to his ability as well as overstatement of our own players. If we can get him for anything less than £30m, I'd be pretty fucking happy, especially considering he's the type of player we've all been looking for but refuse to accept simply because he doesn't have a fancy name come from a lower-level foreign league."
coys,3dmewu,arcisal,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:52:08 2015 UTC,"Benteke is going for 32m, Sterling for 49m, clearly there is some transfer inflation here, but if we want to compete with the big boys we're going to need to spend like them.  McCarthy may not be worth 20m, but if that's what it takes to get him (or someone of his caliber), we're going to have to pay it to keep up with the other big 5."
coys,3dmewu,bigjim6464,4,Fri Jul 17 16:28:17 2015 UTC,"Well City is playing with oil money and indirectly, so are Liverpool. The thing, though, is that we don't need to spend like them. We need to spend smart. Spending 20m on a player that barely improves our team defies logic and is exactly what will prevent us from reaching the next level. We need to either save money to buy elite (20-30m) players or spend less on reserves or players with a lot of potential (5-15m)."
coys,3dmewu,chrish1023,4,Fri Jul 17 17:25:24 2015 UTC,It does give us a better shot... However Chelsea going for Stones makes it way harder again
coys,3dmewu,mappsy91,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:43:57 2015 UTC,"Also, stones for 30 or Tony for 11? I mean, home grown and 5 years younger, but still..."

coys,3dmewu,mappsy91,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:25:53 2015 UTC,"Also mean stones is much less of a sure thing. Everyone assumes he will turn into a great defender, but truth is he wasn't a lock for Everton XI last season. There's not a 19m gap there for me."
coys,3dmewu,Torustorustorus,2,Fri Jul 17 14:51:52 2015 UTC,He played 23 prem games... that's pretty damn high amounts.
coys,3dmewu,mappsy91,2,Fri Jul 17 14:54:30 2015 UTC,He's basically they're CB equivalent of what Bentaleb is to us. He's already that good. For him to not eventually become a regular international he'd have to fuck up massively or get torn apart by injuries.
coys,3dmewu,arcisal,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:38:58 2015 UTC,It's much harder to find a quality/potential quality defender than it is to find a quality midfielder in today's world football. Of course then anyone trying to buy Stones is gonna have to pay out the ass for him.
coys,3dmewu,Your_Personal_Jesus,3,Sat Jul 18 14:53:13 2015 UTC,"Rumors today that Everton turned down 20m for John Stones, and that they want 30m.  If Stones is worth 30, then WTF is McCarthy worth?  Maybe the Evertonian that suggested 50 wasn't far off from the club's valuation.  I don't see Everton having any reason to sell right now.  Given their awful season, there isn't much they can do to entice fresh talent even if they have 50+ to spend.  Also, there is the very real possibility that Martinez finds himself on the hot seat if they can't do better this season."

coys,3dmewu,sirjimmyjazz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:19:07 2015 UTC,Everton wont want to let to many high calibre players leave so if stones goes to chelsea they are less likely to want another one of their better players leave.

coys,3di0h6,ElDingus,20,Thu Jul 16 13:05:03 2015 UTC,"Kaboul, Chiriches, Capoue, Holtby, Lennon and Adebayor were already effectively out of the squad.  Of the players considered for a potential exit, only Stambouli, Paulinho and Soldado made the bench.  You don't have to spend a lot to replace bench players if your starting XI is already in place."
coys,3di0h6,Lou3000,7,Thu Jul 16 13:25:22 2015 UTC,Particularly when Pochettino seems inclined to fill those spots with youth players.
coys,3di0h6,agentdcf,4,Thu Jul 16 14:14:15 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  It's one thing to be buying for the starting XI, but if you're looking to replace Stambouli, a player that was on the bench behind Dembele AND Paulinho, I think you've probably already got that in Alli or Veljkovic."

coys,3dlyg0,mappsy91,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:14:59 2015 UTC,"Would be a great signing, offers something very different and is actually very good technically for such a tall man. I feel sorry for him - we'd never afford him or be attractive enough as he knows he'd have to play exceptionally well to displace Kane (if Poch has showed anything it's that he is loyal to his favourites). He's a great player, but once you join City and get big wages, it's hard to leave.  He's way too good to be on the bench for most teams, and looked absolutely phenomenal the year before last. The main problem is that very few sides play 2 strikers these days, and his lack of pace makes him less attractive. Imagine if he was around instead of Crouch for us. Makes me sad to think about that, a guy knocking the ball down for VdV who can actually score great goals himself."
coys,3dlyg0,theninjanipples,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:18:02 2015 UTC,"I''d love it but I agree, it won't happen. He's not going to move to another club where he's warming the bench. Unless we change our system to support two strikers. Which we won't."
coys,3dlyg0,CyclopsRock,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:25:40 2015 UTC,"What if we changed our system...  or just moved kane to a second striker in a 4411 or something..  One of my favourite games last season was everton at home (2-1, bobby scoring the winner) were we played a compact 4-4 (think atheltico madrid) which two strikers... not saying for every game but it would be good to have a back up system the players knew how to play and utilised 2 strikers (if we got a more reliable second choice)"
coys,3dlyg0,tomasnz,2,Fri Jul 17 15:34:38 2015 UTC,"I agree - we can't assume all defences and midfields will be cracked the same way. The trouble is finding a second striker that's good enough to be useful but who doesn't mind sitting on the bench most of the year. If Bobby hit a bit of form, he'd be perfect for it imo (especially given his age) but, yeah, he won't."
coys,3dlyg0,CyclopsRock,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:14:14 2015 UTC,yeah  I think we are on the same wavelength
coys,3dlyg0,tomasnz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:32:01 2015 UTC,"It'd be amazing, when it comes to proven back up Strikers that do the job when called upon then he is by far the best the league has to offer. But we can't afford his wages, or even promise him regular football to compensate for any cut. Wouldn't make sense for him. I suspect he'll sign for Roma if he leaves!"
coys,3dlyg0,GerOnBears,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:12:57 2015 UTC,"If we broke the wage structure to get Adebayor, and he's now off, surely we can spare some change for him? He is quality, and lets be honest, would definitely get in the starting 11 ahead of Dolphin, as much as I love him."

They've done it before for Adebayor, it benefits us as we get a world class striker (whether he plays or not), and they get the opportunity for him to help nick points off their title rivals, but not play against them."

coys,3dilpr,BodaciousSalacious,38,Thu Jul 16 15:52:22 2015 UTC,"I get the feeling that Poche wants a more dynamic player in there, but for all the talent Dembele has it's definitely worth a shot. We've seen them work well together in the past, too. I'm not of the Makelele mindset but I would like to see them paired, if only to get a sense of how that kind of midfield would work."
coys,3dilpr,sirtetris,4,Thu Jul 16 16:02:56 2015 UTC,I believe the correct spelling is Poch-E
coys,3dilpr,normalguytitty,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:28:18 2015 UTC,"Poch-E, man."
coys,3dilpr,superdago,21,Thu Jul 16 20:21:26 2015 UTC,"I honestly think the defensive side of Mousa's game is underrated. He's not a real destroyer or ball winner, but he's a solid enough interceptor of the ball, and his dribbling allows him to hold on to it well. His issue is that he seems to avoid quick, direct passing from deep in the midfield. I don't think that quite works with how Pochettino has had us playing. Especially with his preference for Mason, who's main strength other than his energy is his directness with his passing."
coys,3dilpr,smokey815,9,Thu Jul 16 16:44:27 2015 UTC,"Honestly, he makes more direct passes than people give him credit for.  At this point, ""Dembele doesn't make clever passes"" is a dominant narrative and people seem to simply not see the intelligent passes he does make.   But people see what they want/expect to see.  I do look for them, and I see plenty of them.    For instance, against Palace away, we scored but one goal, and Dembele created it with this pass, but no one acknowledged it in either the post-match thread or the MotM thread.  Not a single person.  It was all the usual ""can't play a productive pass"" and ""horribly indirect"" and such.  Dembele was actually one of the few bright spots that match, but people just don't see it, or choose not to.  And of course, he makes the occasional stupidly skillful pass , too, but that's not really the point here.  It seems like I'm cherry-picking here, but that's because Mousa tends not to get assists, his best passes happen in the buildup, and highlights of those are hard to find.  But they're there, and he makes a fair few of them just about every time he plays.    EDIT: typos  EDIT 2: Actually, my opinion of Dembele's passing is a lot like your (and my, to an extent) opinion about Soldado's quality off the ball and in build-up play.  It's there, but hardly anyone seems to notice it."
coys,3dilpr,MadArend,4,Fri Jul 17 01:33:56 2015 UTC,"I never said he can't make forward passes, or never does.  It's that he doesn't do it enough.  He has the ability, but not the tendency to be a direct, ambitious passer.  He's a better player than Mason in just about every aspect of the game, but the mentality that Mason has and the approach he takes made him a better fit for what Pochettino wanted him to be doing.  I rate Mousa very highly as a CM, but it seem the man who's opinion matter does not."
coys,3dilpr,smokey815,2,Fri Jul 17 01:57:57 2015 UTC,"LOL, I just wrote a long reply, and then my computer fritzed and I lost the whole thing.   Fuck.  Gist of it was:    Yeah, I wasn't specifically referring to you when I mentioned the more extreme ""he doesn't pass forward"" comments. Much of the difference in ""ambitious"" passing between Dembele and Mason is due to their respective positions.  Mason takes the ball from deep, and often looks to make long, risky passes to bypass the defense or switch the field.  Dembele mostly played CAM, so he gets the ball when he's further forward and the defense has had more of a chancce to set itself, and thus he tends to make shorter passes into feet in the center (where all our AMs like to congregate) or flip it out to the near wing to make space in the center. Most of Moose's appearances last season were as a substitute, so he wasn't in the flow of the game, he was passing to tired teammates, and he was often tasked with holding a lead. Stats aren't the final word, but here are some fun facts I just looked up:    In matches he started, Dembele averaged 1.9 key passes/90.  Not too shabby.  For comparison, Lamela averaged 2.1, Eriksen 2.2, and Cesc Fabregas 2.8.  Mason only averaged 1. When starting in attacking midfield, Dembele averaged 2.8 kp/90, whereas Eriksen and Lamela both averaged 2.2.  But now we're getting into small sample size territory with Mousa. Stats courtesy of whoscored.com.   Shit.  This is still pretty damn long, even on a condensed re-write.   TL;DR: Dembele is a better passer than most people think."
coys,3dilpr,MadArend,2,Fri Jul 17 04:09:28 2015 UTC,I think mussa in front of a middle two with eriksen on the left and lamela on the right is my prefered spurs attacking midfield.
coys,3dilpr,tomasnz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:55:36 2015 UTC,"Eriksen on the left just isn't something that can work consistently. He's best in the middle of the pitch, and he'll just drift in, making it a lot more cramped and harder to create chances."
coys,3dilpr,xman0444,3,Fri Jul 17 11:39:57 2015 UTC,"See my logic is by starting him on the left you get more room for him to drift into, rather than being stuck in the middle with the two inverted wingers coming in as well to further cramp his space.  Players like Mata and Di Maria and stirling and Bale and even sigi all make excellent contributions on the left/right. And I don't think Eriksen is so much different player from those. They all might play better in the middle but that doesn't mean they can't play well outside as well.  So what I am suggesting is that you take a small hit on not fully optimising Eriksen, but you get big gains by playing dembele in an advanced role which has two effects:   Dembele puts pressure on the defensive players much better than Eriksen forcing mistakes and turn overs high up the pitch, he also reads the interceptions well. Dembele's dribbling becomes SUPER dangerous. now when he dribbles past 2 players makes ten meters and makes that horrizontal pass (the one we normally cringe about when he does this from halfway), he is passing to either kane/eirksen/Lamela(or relevent subs) at the top of the box and those passes are super dangerous.   I think demebele gets more dangerous up there especially with the likes of eriksen and lemela (who both like that no.10 spot) running in to support him and receive that dangerous pass and hopefully shot/flick into kanes feet, either way resulting in lots of good scoring opportunities.  Some of that is magical Spurs christmasland. but it was happening like that either side of christmas last year."
coys,3dilpr,tomasnz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:24:31 2015 UTC,"I think the key word here is consistently.  In some matches, Eriksen does go wide often enough to spread things out.  But in other matches, he doesn't.    Plenty of people think that he actually most effective at LW.  But as you implied in your comment, it's also an issue of the effect he has has on other players when he drifts in.  If stays wide enough to keep the defense honest, I do actually like him at LW.  But then we lose Chadli's production.  With Eriksen as a LW/CAM, Lamela as a RW/CAM, and Dembele as a CM/CAM, we have three CAM's who can play other positions at varying degrees of effectiveness.  It's either a pain in the ass or nice versatility, depending on whom you ask.  Thankfully, Townsend doesn't also think he's a CAM.  Oh, and then there's Chadli, who vacillates between a) keeping good witdth and b) wandering all over the damn place."
coys,3dilpr,MadArend,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:04:16 2015 UTC,"I know you said you weren't directing at me necessarily, but I wasn't getting at long passing or chance creation. I actually rate him pretty highly at both. It's just that his mentality tends to be dribble first a little too often to really play the role Pochettino seems to be looking for deeper in midfield."
coys,3dilpr,smokey815,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:30:43 2015 UTC,"Indeed, from deeper in midfield, I agree with you 100%.  So in terms of OP's question, Dembele isn't the right fit.   My post was more of a digression to address the more general, and IMO, erroneous, consensus ...  I'll caveat my skepticism about Dembele in the deeper midfield by saying that we've hardly ever seen Nabil and Mousa together in CM.  I can only remember it happening twice, but in both cases I remember them working really well together.  But the only instance I can actually pinpoint is the 5-3 against Chelsea.  So I wouldn't be opposed to giving it a go, but I do think that the Moose is best at CAM.  Would that we could play a 4-1-4-1 with both him and Christian at CAM, and Nacer and Erik on the wings ..."
coys,3dilpr,MadArend,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:53:00 2015 UTC,"Problem is we need that presence deeper in the midfield. I think he'd be fine there, but I agree he seems to be more effective off the forward. I think he's a very valuable player to have around. Especially if Benji goes. Our only CM with significant experience, though at this point Nabil is almost a vet. Which makes me super happy."
coys,3dilpr,smokey815,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:26:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm assuming we're going to bring in a more forceful presence this summer to pair with Bentaleb.  I don't see Mason/Bentaleb as a CM pairing, but as rotation for each other in the more attacking position of a CM pairing.  We need partners for each of them.  I'd like Stambo to stay and compete for that spot as their partner, but if he goes, then we need to bring in two players who are defensively strong.  This prospect worries me.  I might not be opposed to giving Milos a run out for cups.  But we need need NEED a new strong veteran CM to start with Nabil."
coys,3dilpr,MadArend,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:02:51 2015 UTC,"Knowing next to nothing about Dele, I'm hoping he can be more of a real box to box mid than Mason. If he can defend even a bit more effectively, I think they'd be a very interesting pairing. I know he's a good goal scorer, but if his defensive work is even decent I think it could work against most PL sides."
coys,3dilpr,smokey815,7,Fri Jul 17 21:55:13 2015 UTC,"Supporters are strangely (though in a lot of ways justifiably) hard on Dembele, especially considering the amount of support and good vibes we send Soldado's way. Maybe it's an attitude thing."

coys,3dilpr,pandanomic,16,Thu Jul 16 20:52:35 2015 UTC,Skilled schmilled. Means nothing. Adel Taraabt is skilled. Rohan Ricketts was skilled. You need to be effective and Dembele is not.

And he's not an age where he's going to massively improve.   I really respect that people have such belief in him, but there's a reality with Dembele and that's that he's not effective enough. At all. And the current manager prefers Mason."

coys,3dilpr,Paw_In_My_Face,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:39:06 2015 UTC,"Jesus Christ calm down.   Aside from keeping the ball and passing sideways really well, tell me specifically what you think Dembele offers to Tottenham and why he should get picked, and then tell me there aren't better options out there. He offers nothing going forward, he's not much of a tackler and his fitness is constantly being called in to question.   The dude's been displaced by two youth products with hardly any Prem experience this season. Come on. It's not hard to see he's not good enough. I'm also not saying he's a terrible player, but if he wouldn't get into a team above us in the league, why should he get in to ours? Hardly ""rewriting history to fit a narrative"" or ""dumping on his time here"". I'm voicing an opinion on a bloody subreddit about what happened last season. Why is three seasons ago relevant to now?"
coys,3dilpr,straplessbrad,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:56:24 2015 UTC,"Was I not calm...? I don't think Dembele offers much to Tottenham right now. I said you can justify leaving him out of the squad, for the reasons yo usaid.  You asked what's he done in his time at the club. I answered, that's why 3 seasons ago is relevant. It is rewriting history to make it seem like he never had anything to offer, which is kind of what you were doing when you asked what's he done in his time at the club."

He'll make a fine back up from here on in but I can't see it getting better for him unless he ups his game, and is he the type to push on at this stage? Three goals, not many assists and not helping our awful defensive record across all of those seasons. He's hardly set the world alight.  Looked like a different player for Fulham to what we ended up with."
coys,3dilpr,straplessbrad,2,Fri Jul 17 19:30:09 2015 UTC,"Not only that, but his hips are made of glass, so he would require a decent amount of rotation anyway"
coys,3dilpr,doodoobrown7,4,Thu Jul 16 17:45:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how other people view it, but I'd actually like Bentaleb to become the more defensive midfielder in our set up. He's tall, good on the ball, relatively quick and strong. If he really worked on the tactical side of his game he could be an absolutely dominant defensive midfielder. Just because he's a ""defensive"" midfielder, doesn't mean he can't roam forward. You'd like to think, as a professional footballer, that whoever partnered him would be intelligent enough to sit in on these occasions. The problem is, Mason hasn't shown he is that intelligent defensively."

coys,3dilpr,faggotpleb,4,Thu Jul 16 20:53:46 2015 UTC,"I disagree mate. They're both attack minded centre mids really. We need a proper holding midfielder to sit deep and protect the back four, whilst his partner goes on attacking runs."

coys,3dlufu,rathey123,9,Fri Jul 17 09:05:06 2015 UTC,"The problem comes with the fact that it's not just the new expensive player you're signing who would be getting the higher wage rate.  If we sign a new CM on 120k a week, how long before Eriksen/Lloris/Vertonghen/Kane/whoever else is playing well is asking for parity? And then the second tier players are asking for a raise to because ""yeah, Lloris is better than me, but he's not that much better than me - i used to get 30k a week less than him, now I'm getting 70k a week less than him - so where's my 30% raise?"". And so on right down through the squad. Suddenly you're paying your young fifth choice CB 40k a week because you main CB's are on over a 100k and your backups are on over 70k.  Bringing in just a single player who's on significantly more than everyone else has repercussions much greater repercussions than just adding that player's pay packet to the wage bill."
coys,3dlufu,busstopboxer,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:29:30 2015 UTC,"This does make sense yeah, how come players wages are such public knowledge though? In other lines of work what people you are working with earn is generally kept quite private.   Also isnt Ade on 100k a week? Kane obviously did 10x better than him last season but signed a new contract which put him on just 35k a week?"
coys,3dlufu,AtLeastImCooler,2,Fri Jul 17 10:43:42 2015 UTC,Kane did well for 1 season and he's only 21.  As he (hopefully) continues to show how class he is he will get offered new contract with higher wages to keep him at the club.  If we gave him a 100k a week contract then not only are we taking a massive gamble on a 21 year old whose had 1 good season but also he will expect raises in the future depending on performances. If he does really well we would have to outlay even more thans 100k.
coys,3dlufu,scott_tizzle,6,Fri Jul 17 17:14:41 2015 UTC,The scale on average player wages per team is not linear.  It goes up exponentially when you get to the top 5-7 teams in the world.  Just because we maybe the 13th highest doesn't mean we are that close to the top teams.  We are more likely closer to the teams that are in the 20 and 30s.

coys,3dlufu,Roshambo2110,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:23:29 2015 UTC,I think are wages are creeping up slowly and when the new stadium is racking in the cash they will even more. I dont really want to be a club paying peopl 200k+ a week becuase they is just absurd. The higher wages we pay the more more we have to make for FFP and more likely ticket prices and merch prices are to go up. they already charge 55 for a blank shirt at the spurs shop

Our fans often say things like ""but he's a good player, pay a bit more"", but that sets a precedent and you'd have to increase the wages of our current players or face morale issues.  All that said, our wage bill is generally creeping upwards, and I would assume that anywhere between (5-10) years after the stadium move will see them increase further. It's horrible to say, but Arsenal set a very enviable model with the Library; reducing spending whilst financing a stadium, and they're currently reaping the rewards with some big transfers.  For the short term, if we can keep up with the top four, I'd be very happy as it gives us a great boost to finally try and compete with the other teams financially without incurring huge debt once the stadium is built."

He's delayed on signing players and we've lost out in the league due to fine margins so many times you wonder if he'd have spent more maybe we'd be better off. A lot of our managers seem to all say the same thing about not getting the A or even B target.  He'll sign a player on a free of for cheap; Pienaar or HOltby and sell them for more, that's nor a miracle worker.   Looking about people also praising the money he got for Paulinho and whoever else, he also payed over the odds for those players too but.

coys,3dhmp6,NotConor419,11,Thu Jul 16 10:56:53 2015 UTC,This is a good reminder..  he is a quality player.  ...even if he is also a dick..(allegedly)
coys,3dhmp6,tomasnz,5,Thu Jul 16 10:58:53 2015 UTC,"I was at this game which flew under the radar a bit as it wasn't televised.  There was a couple of mistakes that Jan and Kaboul kicked off at each other for, with the crowd very clearly taking Jans side. Whenever they would argue the crowd sang the ""super jan"" song and in my opinion at least you could see A) Kaboul had the ump about it and B) it didn't seem like your average CB pairing having a pop as you do in games, seemed more to it.  I don't believe we saw him again after that."
coys,3dhmp6,WillSpur,4,Thu Jul 16 11:35:12 2015 UTC,"I was at that game, the Burnley 4-2.  If you actually look at the highlights, the mistakes are Jans fault."
coys,3dhmp6,NotConor419,4,Thu Jul 16 11:36:47 2015 UTC,"Regardless of whoever was at blame it didn't go down well, perhaps I was reading too much into it but it genuinely seemed more than your standard telling off from your CB partner, and everyone evidently supported Jan. I just know after that he wasn't seen since."

coys,3dhmp6,harry_h00d,3,Thu Jul 16 14:16:12 2015 UTC,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRTotRI9eFg  Kabouls last game. Go ahead and watch him. It's only a brief highlight he did much worse throughout the game but all the chances Leicester had he was limp as fuck. That first chance and the first goal. Kaboul was not good last year. If you think he was you didn't watch the games. Ah Conor. Paulinho got sold...to a chinese team lol, Kaboul is going to be sold, Stambouli is going to be sold. What are you going to talk about this year? How Vorm should start over Lloris? At least you can still call for Ade."
coys,3dhmp6,Now_known_as_Betty,0,Thu Jul 16 13:31:56 2015 UTC,"Did you miss my opening sentence?  ""This would be a good transfer"""
coys,3dhmp6,NotConor419,3,Thu Jul 16 13:35:37 2015 UTC,lol you called for him all last year and the rest of your comment suggests you prefer him to Dier and Fazio. And you called him very good. How do you not see the relevance of my comment?
coys,3dhmp6,Now_known_as_Betty,2,Thu Jul 16 13:39:51 2015 UTC,"I do prefer him to Fazio and Chiriches, I likely would have called for him to compete for the CB position after Dier's Newcastle mistake, or perhaps for the Fiorentina game where we made zero use of our squad depth in the most hectic week of the year. Two very reasonable things to do.  And as for this season?  Kane will have a very tough season ahead due to coming off the expectations of his golden season. Like I did earlier this season against the majority, I will call for Kane's continued involvement.  I suspect Rose could have odd moments which will have the fickle subset of our fanbase return to their abusive ways, I'll be fighting those battles too.  Chadli could very likely face similar issues, so no doubt I'll be sure to remind people of his importance.  Considering all of the hate I get for defending underrated Spurs players, you'd think I'm the only spurs fan on /r/coys."
coys,3dhmp6,NotConor419,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:44:31 2015 UTC,"Definitely.  It was also never going to be easy for Kaboul to come from an injury that pretty much prevented him kicking a ball for two seasons, into the team we played with last season.  More so, in his pre-injury days, he was definitely a player that grew into his position; I don't think he's the most natural talent when it comes to defensive positioning but in his great season with us he seemed to overcome this through increasing familiarity and his raw athleticism.  He was never going to be offered the same time to grow (or regrow) into the position last season with us.  Still put in a couple of good shifts - and his performance versus Arsenal where he was just outstanding will stay in the memory for a while.  If Sunderland can grant him patience and regular playing time, and he can avoid the injury flaring up again, I think he will be an excellent buy for them."

coys,3dhvel,PossibilityZero,3,Thu Jul 16 13:31:28 2015 UTC,"I got my license nearly three years ago when I was 17 but since I live in NYC, having a car wasn't really necessary.  I was in an accident last month where I was run over by an SUV that ran a stop sign as I was crossing a street. Since, I've been a bit traumatized and afraid in cars or crossing the street. But since I got the car and started driving away, my anxiety has disappeared. It was pretty much just something I had to force myself to get over and I'm back to normal now.  Parking is a bit tough though but I'm on the very outskirts of the Bronx so it's not near as bad as it is in other parts of the city."

So I've always been very nervous in parking lots. I usually park away from other cars as well.  I would've never have gotten a car if I wasn't away for school. I rent an apartment at school in a less urban area so the insurance is so much cheaper now that I registered with that address.

coys,3dhvel,Soldado4lyf,3,Thu Jul 16 20:33:01 2015 UTC,"I had the worst dream about Jose Mourinho Tuesday night. My friend and I were back in high school acting like shits so we got sentenced to detention, just the two of us after school. The proctor turns out to be Jose, but I don't recognize him as a football manager, just realize that I should fear him. He takes us to a beige tiled room that has a huge sort of engine block crusher with wooden sides in it which is running. He says, ""if you want to be free again you will have to make this disappear, I don't care how."" and smiles. We think it's a joke until the first night comes and goes. Then weeks go by. We have eaten some of the wood from the sides of the machine but have mostly given up. One night when Jose comes in to give us our daily bologna and white bread sandwiches, he turns his back to me and I take my chance, delivering a thunderous headbutt to the back of his head. He crumples to the ground and we bolt out the door. We're sprinting down a pitch black hallway toward some double doors, me in front, my friend close behind. I hear the ceiling crash and my friend isn't with me anymore; I don't need to look to know he's been taken by Jose. I burst out into the parking lot and run through dim streetlights until I get to the edge of it and turn around. Off in a field to the left is Jose, wearing only his tighty-whitey underwear, walking in my direction. I look down and have a revolver in my hand, and when I look back up he is much closer, casually dangling a revolver of his own at his side, so I pull up and start shooting. Two of my shots tear through his pasty legs, so I turn and run into a huge expo type building, a glassy one kind of like what you see research corporations in in movies. There are streamers all over the ceiling and sun is shining brightly through the windows. I run and run, and come up on a group of people. Jose is there in a suit, leading them on what looks like a tour. He catches my eye and says, ""I'm not dead.""  Then I woke up. Guys...I think something really bad is going to happen against Chelsea this season."

City are getting their act together. Liverpool will no doubt be a lot better.  I think back to the summer of 2013. What an opportunity we had. Fergie had quit. Arsenal were in turmoil. Chelsea were in transition. City were also in transition.  If Levy had given us a bit of stability by insisting Bale stay for another season and sticking with the manager, we could have broken into the top four and possibly had a tilt at the title. Instead he offloaded Bale, brought in almost a whole team of players, effectively meaning we had to go through a massive transition at the same time as the other top clubs.  So thanks for that Levy. You blew our golden chance to make a breakthrough at the top and now top four looks little more than a pipedream."

We've got a talented young squad, we're finally sureing up the defense, and it's looking like we're going to make a few more attacking signings to boot. Not to mention we shipped out a lot of the deadwood so it's finally looking like Pochettino's team. Last season 6th was par, and we exceeded that. This season 5th is par so given patience and backing, I can see Pochettino dragging us into that top 4."

coys,3dhrem,couplingrhino,3,Thu Jul 16 16:49:36 2015 UTC,Soldado is that guy in your family that always fucks up but because he is family someone is always willing to give him another chance.
coys,3dhrem,sirtetris,2,Thu Jul 16 19:38:18 2015 UTC,"No. Soldado is like the Italian sports car you bought because you thought it looked fantastic on Top Gear.  You had to remortgage your house to afford it and you're still paying enough to buy a decent second hand motorbike for it every month.  It is utterly useless. When you took it for its first spin its axle broke after seeing how fast it would do 0-60. You end up getting tired of having to call the AA when it consistently breaks down on short trips to the supermarket, but won't admit that to anyone. It and you are the laughing stock of your friends and colleagues.  Eventually you have to pay to have it scrapped after four years of trying to sell the damn thing, during which your wife has left you for a man with a functioning Volkwagen Polo.   Then you find you're still stuck with the MG Roadster you bought along with it at the auction but which has an embarassing hole in the floor and an underpowered engine that is missing critical parts that don't exist any more and a nasty habit of stalling just as you take it onto the motorway. You were of course assured of its unrivalled quality, resale value and value for money when you bought it, still claim it is your pride and joy, and still won't admit to your friends or yourself that you in fact know nothing about cars."
coys,3dhrem,couplingrhino,2,Fri Jul 17 09:12:44 2015 UTC,"It could happen!  I think it'd depend on how much more unstuck we can get from the AVB habits of slow, deliberate possession and long shots. Soldado is the polar opposite of that philosophy. If we can start getting the ball into the box more - and Poche's counterpress could be a good route toward that - Soldado just might have his opportunity to flourish.  Not that I'd put any money on it."

coys,3di898,throwingnickels,12,Thu Jul 16 15:41:30 2015 UTC,Just me who thinks Benteke has massive flop potential for some reason?
coys,3di898,rathey123,28,Thu Jul 16 14:08:18 2015 UTC,"I'd be absolutely chuffed if we got him. He's a more technically gifted Lukaku. He's Bony with more athleticism, but slightly less guile in the box. I think he's strong, fast, and just an absolute menace in front of goal no matter the range. His ball control is fairly good, as well. You can't discount his production, especially when thinking about how poor his service has been at Villa. He's quality and, in this market, I think 30M is within the realm of reason, if a little high (25 and I wouldn't blink).  To address OP's question - yes I think that would pave the way for Ade to go to Villa a bit more easily, but I think he's beyond their wage structure and I can't imagine Levy suddenly wants to subsidize when he refused in January. I think he's likely to go to a lower league with plenty of money, even though he's said in the past that he wants to stay in top competitions. Nobody else can/will pay for him."

I think he understands that paying $50k to have him play elsewhere is more sensible than $100k in dead money - assuming we go along with not giving him a kit number should he stay"
coys,3di898,bull_moose_man,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:07:55 2015 UTC,"I heard similar, I remember the problem being that West Ham were too close to us in the table at the time, but I can't see that being an issue with Villa."

coys,3di898,abishar,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:12:23 2015 UTC,Levy wouldn't sell a potentially decent striker to what was fairly considered at the time a rival. Although they turned to have a crap season in the end the logic stands

I'm not sure if it's a cultural thing, or if people not from London don't realise quite how small and over populated it is. Sure, the club pours money into housing and such, but if you really believe that's for the benefit of the local people then their PR team have done a cracking job. The only reason we bother with this redevelopment of local areas is to please the local council enough to get permission. The housing will be way too expensive for most people, and many people will presumably have to move which is a huge inconvenience. There's not exactly a plethora of housing available nearby.  That's not to say I'm not for the new stadium; I can't wait for it! But to call legitimate complaints from local people, who will probably be massively effected by this, as ""Spurs bashing"" is just wrong."

coys,3di2wx,hteezy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:48:49 2015 UTC,"As far a chicharito and Falcao, their parent teams seemed to want to move them, but their wages were too high (Falcao), or they weren't going to get on the pitch enough to profile what they could do (Chicarito), no idea what the story is with manquilo.   All I'm saying is it seems strange for a ""big club"" to take in a young talent and develop it for another team."
coys,3di2wx,TheyDidItFirst,2,Thu Jul 16 15:53:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah obviously no one wants to develop someone else's player, but if Poch thinks Rabiot's good enough to contribute this season (remember, this is a spot of serious weakness) and there isn't anyone significantly better that the club can sign permanently I don't see why he shouldn't come on loan."
coys,3di2wx,Pochehontas,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:56:34 2015 UTC,"Liverpool had Sahin as well a couple of seasons ago. I know Manchester United loaned Henke Larsson back in the day too... I mean it's not that it happens every season, but big teams also loan players when they need a gap to fill. And big teams have the luxury of actually getting quality players on loan."

Actual first hand knowledge and insight that isn't simply a rehashing of popular opinion disguised as original thought under a clickbait title like most of the blogs.

I also questioned the Bale signing, although to be fair the original point of DML (the letters) was one massive piss take of Spurs fans expectations and how fickle we are. Reality is, I can't do that any more and be original as Twitter has allowed the maddening section of our fanbase to showcase their insanity, thus taking away the ability to parody.

I really like what The Tottenham Way is doing - it's sometimes a bit clickbaity but generally the articles are engaging and try to be a bit different. The Fighting Cock blog (http://www.thefightingcock.co.uk/blog/articles/) has some fantastic contributors and Bardi does a great job of editing it.

Petrilli doesn't seem to write anymore, but when he does it's been fantastic stuff. Formerly Lennon's Eyebrow (now Ben Daniels) and Ed Francis are also great writers.

coys,3dg9nu,Lou3000,11,Thu Jul 16 01:09:35 2015 UTC,"Well, except that our midfield for almost all of last season was Bentaleb-Mason but now it's Bentaleb with literally fucking nobody because Mason has to sit on the bench in case Eriksen gets injured? And why isn't Carroll there then? Why are we sending out ten men in this stupid depth exaggeration?  Bentaleb, Mason, Veljkovic, Dembele, Carroll, Alli. 2 spots, 6 players. 7 including Alderweireld, who said he'd happily do a shift in midfield. You might not like them but they're still there.  And Onomah and Pritchard can play in the hole."

coys,3dg9nu,tottenhamhotsauce,7,Thu Jul 16 05:31:10 2015 UTC,Remember what people were saying about Bentaleb at the end of last season. Mason is inexperienced but he will improve.
coys,3dg9nu,Messisfoot,0,Thu Jul 16 10:06:49 2015 UTC,"But he is also not Bentaleb. Nabil has a much higher ceiling in terms of quality.

coys,3dg9nu,Spurs94,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:40:28 2015 UTC,Was and got a transfer to Liverpool after a decent season with Poch. Or you could take Soldado and Paulinho on the other side of the spectrum.
coys,3dg9nu,energyi,2,Thu Jul 16 18:16:12 2015 UTC,"Precisely, the thing about Mason is he isn't a deep midfielder. He's a no.10 who was pushed deep by Poch because he had no one else with the brains to do what he wanted in that spot. He deserves a spot in the squad but we need someone better (better defensively) in his spot. Huge fan of Mason but we need someone better in the spot he currently holds."
coys,3dg9nu,airz23s_coffee,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:43:11 2015 UTC,Exactly. Mason is not a deep midfielder. If you ask me we should use him as backup for Eriksen as he would provide cover and an alternative attacking style.
coys,3dg9nu,nzcoys,6,Thu Jul 16 18:41:48 2015 UTC,"Mason helped us get to 5th place, he keeps his spot.   In a lot of those games we got 5th in spite of Mason.  EDIT: I just realised how stupid this looks. He was important in some games with his energy and passion, but there were often games where he looked completely lost and gave the ball away with every touch. We need a level headed experienced midfielder to go next to Bentaleb. Mason is good but he isn't guaranteed starter good."
coys,3dg9nu,theninjanipples,6,Thu Jul 16 07:26:30 2015 UTC,Could not agree more. I've got as much faith in Mason as I do in Bentaleb (which is a lot)
coys,3dg9nu,Doomchicken7,4,Thu Jul 16 06:03:42 2015 UTC,"Carroll is Championship quality, despite playing relatively regularly in a very decent Premier League team who actually have a solid midfield? Not sure I agree on that one."
coys,3dg9nu,theninjanipples,5,Thu Jul 16 06:50:29 2015 UTC,He didn't play relatively regularly at all.
coys,3dg9nu,mpw90,3,Thu Jul 16 07:13:05 2015 UTC,"I used the word relatively. In my opinion, if you play more than just an odd cameo for a decent Premier League side, then you're better than Championship quality.  I'm not saying he should be a starter for us, but to simply dismiss him is an oversight. Especially considering Mason's rise to the first team this season; Carroll was always ahead of him until this season, and is younger. Why shouldn't we try him?"
coys,3dg9nu,LMeister10,-1,Thu Jul 16 07:22:40 2015 UTC,"Just because you used the word relatively, doesn't mean it's a valid argument to say he played regularly.  I am relatively professional at football. Relative to what? Someone who can't kick a ball? I'm still not relatively professional.  Anyway, I think Carroll will be played a bit this season."
coys,3dg9nu,theninjanipples,4,Thu Jul 16 11:43:24 2015 UTC,He was player of the month for Swansea at one point! Don't discount our Tommy
coys,3dg9nu,mpw90,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:45:31 2015 UTC,"Relative to a Championship standard player who plays in the Prem. Relative to players like Mason, who the season before last could hardly get a game for a Championship side."
coys,3dg9nu,theninjanipples,-1,Thu Jul 16 14:03:20 2015 UTC,I really disapprove of this logic. Someone else made this claim the other day.  I kindly pointed out that Harry Kane is also a prime example of not always getting much game time.
coys,3dg9nu,mpw90,2,Thu Jul 16 14:10:11 2015 UTC,"Harry Kane is a one off though, really. I'm not saying Carroll IS better than Mason. I'm just suggesting that we shouldn't be so quick to dismiss Carroll, considering up until last season, he was always seen as the better prospect. Carroll looked decent enough when thrown into games at a young age. I've seen very few young academy players as comfortable and intelligent on the ball as Carroll, he's just somewhat unlucky that he isn't a physical specimen."
coys,3dg9nu,theninjanipples,0,Thu Jul 16 14:21:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not dismissing anyone. I'm saying that just because you put ""relatively"" in front of something, it doesn't make it valid by contrast.   I don't disagree with you, I completely believe that Tom Carroll is an exceptional technical footballer. Does he have the grit that Mason brings? No. Does he have the ability to seek out better passes? Absolutely, and with style.  Also, Harry Kane isn't really a one off: Andros Townsend."
coys,3dg9nu,mrandocalrissian,3,Thu Jul 16 14:28:56 2015 UTC,"Well, quite and fairly are two of the most common synonyms for relatively. He played around 15 times I think, which is quite regularly for a loan player who was described as being Championship quality. My apologies if my wording wasn't perfect.  I guess that's true re: Andros; but I meant more in terms of a player playing outrageously better than any previous form suggested."
coys,3dg9nu,cfowlaa,-1,Thu Jul 16 14:42:32 2015 UTC,"I really like Carroll and think he is still of value to our squad, but I wouldn't rely too heavily on his Swansea loan as evidence of his ability.  He was really only afforded opportunities due to the injuries of others and his play was still quite inconsistent."
coys,3dg9nu,Lou3000,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:15:14 2015 UTC,How is Carroll championship quality when he won Player of the Month for a Premier League side this past season..?
coys,3dg9nu,pandanomic,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:35:18 2015 UTC,"I think his time at Swansea was probably better defined by the fact that he only had 8 starts.  I actually watched a good bit of Swansea this season, and Carroll is a very difficult player to utilize properly.  When the game is going through him and he has time to dictate tempo, he can be very, very good.  But when the midfield is getting run over, he absolutely disappears.    I'm probably overly harsh to say he's Championship quality, but the problem is that if I were to say he's lower level PL quality, that means that week in and week out, he's going to be playing in an outclassed midfield where he will struggle.  He needs to play for a team like Spurs, but I fear time is running out on developing into the complete midfielder we need."
coys,3dg9nu,Lou3000,2,Thu Jul 16 15:49:19 2015 UTC,this sub hates Mason    Eh maybe   dembele stagnates the attack   Pot meet kettle. Dembele gets more shit from this sub than Mason despite being a vastly better player. Mason had one goal and a couple nice assists. Dembele usually gets about the same plus his amazing dribbling ability. Oh and our best 3 months of the season were when he was starting.
coys,3dg9nu,pandanomic,4,Thu Jul 16 10:52:53 2015 UTC,That's a nonsense stat.  Mason is being played as a deep lying midfielder.  In 2010/11 Luka Modric in 32 league appearances for Spurs had 3 goals and 2 assists.  In 2011/12 Modric in 36 appearances had 4 goals and 4 assists.  Ryan Mason had 29 league appearances (in his first season) had 1 goal and 4 assists.  Either Mason is as good (if not better) as Modric or goals/assists is a stupid way to measure a deep lying midfielder.
coys,3dg9nu,Lou3000,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:42:18 2015 UTC,"You can forget the stat then, but my point about us being at our best with Dembele on the field still stands. You're just mindlessly repeating the same nonsense the rest of this sub does regarding him. At some point it became cool to say Dembele stifles our offense and pretend December - Feb never existed."
coys,3dg9nu,pandanomic,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:33:41 2015 UTC,I genuinely think Mason is better.
coys,3dg9nu,The1KrisRoB,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:36:41 2015 UTC,You can think that without throwing other players under the bus.
coys,3dg9nu,pandanomic,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:40:26 2015 UTC,"The telling point is that the only stat Dembele beats Mason in last season is passing% which kind of fits with the biggest knock on Dembele, he slows the play down and plays that safe sideways pass.  Add to that defensively Mason was one of our best last season while playing a role he hasn't really played before.  Honestly I'm sure if Dembele was a better choice, Pochettino and all of the training staff might have noticed it during all those training sessions you missed, and the hours of post match analysis you probably didn't get the invite to.  Now I'm not saying Mason should start next season. Personally I'd have him as cover for Bentaleb who should be playing alongside a proper defensive midfielder."
coys,3dg9nu,swiper33,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:48:49 2015 UTC,"he slows the play down and plays that safe sideways pass   A trite phrase that this sub likes to repeat without pointing to concrete examples. Also, you know who else preferes sideways passes and recycling possession? Bentaleb. I don't see the sub crucifying him for it though.  I'm sure there is a reason, but it's not what the armchair managers of this sub blabber."
coys,3dg9nu,peter_j_,-1,Fri Jul 17 04:51:15 2015 UTC,"We don't hate Mason but he isn't good enough to always start. We need a midfielder, end of story."
coys,3dg9nu,Gandalfthecat2,4,Thu Jul 16 13:47:06 2015 UTC,For once its the defense that looks just about right!
coys,3dg9nu,The1KrisRoB,4,Thu Jul 16 06:54:16 2015 UTC,Dembele is such a fantastic player. It will be a shame if he doesn't get a run in the first team to prove.   There's no comparing him and mason. Just Mason runs like a chicken with his head cut off doesn't mean he has half the skill of Dembele.
coys,3dg9nu,Gandalfthecat2,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:40:00 2015 UTC,"Just Mason runs like a chicken with his head cut off doesn't mean he has half the skill of Dembele.   And yet statistically Mason beat Dembele in just about every stat bar passing% and that's probably because Dembele always looks for a safe (and mostly non threatening) pass.  Something people overlook is that Mason was one of our best defensive players last season. Which is a good thing considering he was playing along side Bentaleb in a position we all agree requires a good defensive player.  Now I'm not saying Mason is the right player to play alongside Bentaleb. But when you consider he was asked to do a job (one which he's not really known for as a more attacking player) and he did it better than anyone else in the team, I really don't think he deserves the stick he gets from a lot of people.  People talk about how good we'll look with a proper DM playing alongside Bentaleb, but I dare say Mason would look a lot better playing alongside a pure DM as well. Again Bentaleb is my #1 choice, but should he get injured I'd be fairly relaxed knowing we had Mason as #2"
coys,3dg9nu,Torustorustorus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:32:34 2015 UTC,I've always loved Dembele because of his skill level and the way he glides around the pitch. I admit the killer ball is missing and so are the goals but I feel Mason is liked just because Poch loves energy players.
coys,3dg9nu,takethelonggwayhome,2,Fri Jul 17 14:12:11 2015 UTC,"Given depth and recent USMNT use, certainly have to consider possibility that yedlin provides bench option for both rb and rw. Could add alot of value to his role this season. (long term value may still be in loan).   Probably have to include dembele as option at cam.   Does seem to be odd mix of quality with quality depth and holes with voids behind them."
coys,3dg9nu,moon_monster,14,Thu Jul 16 01:19:19 2015 UTC,I don't want this to turn into a big Yedlin debate thing that eventually become an America thing but personally I don't see him making an impact on the first team this season. I just don't think he's good enough (yet).
coys,3dg9nu,sirtetris,13,Thu Jul 16 01:25:38 2015 UTC,"American here.  It's really pretty simple.  No chance he's first team ready.  I don't think he will ever be good enough for first team Rb at Spurs, but there's a decent chance he could be an impact rw/rm.  He either needs to be an impact sub at rw and rb off of the bench this season, or he should be loaned to a championship side where he can start at rw/rm. I totally get the exhaustion from unwarranted hype of many U.S. players of the past, but Yedlin (and more so Zardes) are the first real talents in the physically imposing and athletically gifted players that I believe will continue to come from America in years to come.  At some point hopefully these players can couple their absurd physical skills with technical ability.  Then we might finally have a very special player."
coys,3dg9nu,tabelz,3,Thu Jul 16 01:33:31 2015 UTC,With Yedlins pace I think he makes a wonderful super sub. Bring him on real late in the game as a rw/rm to test the fitness of the defenders. Although I do agree that I don't think he's good enough for PL just yet
coys,3dg9nu,speck_of_gold,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:43:58 2015 UTC,So the same as last season except Toby in place of Eric Dier. We'll have to see what the rest of the transfer window brings in terms of changes - hopefully a CM and someone to challenge Chadli's spot on the wing.
coys,3dg9nu,harry_h00d,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:17:58 2015 UTC,Except Bentaleb will be better. Rose has come leaps and bounds since last season as well.

Do I want another CM, preferably a proven premier league player who can slot right into the XI? Of course. I'd have loved to have Schneiderlin or Milner. I'd love it if we made a run at Fabian Delph. But I don't think we need any of those players."

coys,3dfabd,TheDrunkyMonkey,13,Thu Jul 16 09:34:23 2015 UTC,"Look at the quality of players you named. Carroll only started 8 times for Swansea last season. Alli is coming from League One and Milos is basically in the same boat. I'm all for giving youth a chance but damn, that's just not good enough IMO. The fact they could develop into really top class players as no effect on the fact we need a top class CM in 6 weeks time."
coys,3dfabd,SuperSaiyanNoob,4,Thu Jul 16 04:19:42 2015 UTC,"We need a proper CM next to Bentaleb. That is the big glaring weakness of our starting XI now, and CM is the most important position on the whole field. How many times did we get over run with Mason and Bentaleb? How many times was there too much space from midfield and defence? How many times did we let runners through?   A CM is, and should be our top priority now. Watch out for a big bid for McCarthy"

This makes me think that Levy must have some business in progress, since DM is probably already our shallowest position, after the other business we've done so far this summer.  I wonder if this might precipitate a Rabiot move from PSG, obviously with the aid of quite a bit of money, as I think Rabiot is the superior player."

coys,3dd6pz,superdago,3,Wed Jul 15 14:48:18 2015 UTC,"Plus, it's not like he will be earning 40K a week until normal person retirement age. Players have a very short time to earn money, and if he can earn 40-50% more for the rest of his playing career, he should do that."

coys,3dd6pz,flancresty,2,Thu Jul 16 11:26:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's about the ""easy"" route at all. Benji and most footballers believe they can be exceptional, and generally sign with the best club they can, especially once they reach their mid-20s.   And frankly, the difference in work between a starter and a fringe player is minimal, the only time the starters are ""working"" and the fringe players are not is during matches. The rest of the time, their job is the same: lots of training."

coys,3defjv,image_linker_bot,11,Wed Jul 15 19:15:07 2015 UTC,AFAIK the link to Swindon was through Tim Sherwood. We didn't send any players to them this past season so I believe we are either looking for a new partner or just spreading players out.
coys,3defjv,Panencephalitis,4,Wed Jul 15 19:15:40 2015 UTC,This is correct. That link was gone when Sherwood left the club
coys,3defjv,melihs11,10,Wed Jul 15 17:26:03 2015 UTC,Leyton Orient and Stevenage. Leyton Orient's proximity to Tottenham means the club have a history of cooperation and Tottenham used to hold friendlies with Stevenage Borough every preseason.
coys,3defjv,BlandoCalrissian,5,Thu Jul 16 03:42:23 2015 UTC,If I remember correctly Leyton Orient is the only official connection we have in Football Manager. (I know it's a game but they're usually spot on with stuff like that.)

As part of the transfer agreement between the two clubs, Tottenham, Toronto FC and MLSE will enter into a groundbreaking, four-year Advertising Rights Agreement. The deal will see Toronto FC and MLSE provide promotional and branding opportunities, experiential activities and advertising, broadcasting, social media and digital rights across all of MLSE's properties and media platforms. Additionally, MLSE will carry Tottenham Hotspur F.C. official merchandise at their retail outlets, as well as support the THFC Official Canadian Supporter's Club.

coys,3di6po,sirtetris,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:15:51 2015 UTC,I posted this lineup a few weeks ago and got absolutely downvoted to death. But after seeing him play 3 centre backs last few games of the season I stand by Poch looking into this formation. Especially as we have 2 great attacking and crossing fullbacks now.   http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=8123
coys,3di6po,Torustorustorus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:17:03 2015 UTC,"That leaves waaaay too much space in the midfield. Bentaleb is good, but there isn't a DM in the world who could cover that much ground by himself."
coys,3di6po,Richforaday,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:26:50 2015 UTC,"Spurs have the defenders to play 3, but your formation would require bentaleb to be the world's best athlete and also not be bound by Einstein physics. You'd need to drop either chadli or Lamela for another true mid like dembele, Mason, or a new player.   Also Poch didn't play with 3 cb in cb roles, he's clearly not into that scene.   We can't try to play with a 2 man defensive unit again (we didn't like that last year), but Poch answer will be a better defensive midfield presence like Wanyama, not a 3rd cb."
coys,3di6po,sirtetris,0,Thu Jul 16 15:36:58 2015 UTC,"I guess that's why I didn't see it haha! I just wanted to see peoples thoughts really, I guess playing five at the back could only help our defensive struggles."
coys,3di6po,caribouslack,2,Thu Jul 16 14:21:17 2015 UTC,"I think we didnt help ourselves last season having our fullpacks push so high up the pitch they were often caught out of position leading to mistakes and goals. This would allow them to push up with an added cover of a 3rd CB. Also it solves the partner to Bentaleb question. Maybe why we havent been pushing for centre mids as we will have Mason, Dembele and Bentaleb all for that 1 central spot."
coys,3ddjmd,SubbyDoo,15,Wed Jul 15 12:48:19 2015 UTC,"Tottenham 2.0 -- no drama, no panic, no net transfer spend, no realistic hope of finishing in Top 4.  Oddly, I'm pretty cool with it -- quite like this young team, and never have anything to watch on Thursday nights."
coys,3ddjmd,kaleidoscopic82,10,Wed Jul 15 13:47:21 2015 UTC,Sensible is the very definition of our transfer business barring one splurge financed by the Bale sale. We've bought largely for resale value and bargains for several years now.
coys,3ddjmd,smokey815,3,Wed Jul 15 14:03:37 2015 UTC,"Seriously, the first line of the article turned me off, although the rest was good. We made some bad deals in the Summer of Bale, but besides that, we've brought in low priced, high profit players on a regular basis. Recent were all incredibly sensible if you ignore some of the deals from after the Bale sale. Not all of them turned out great, but they were all cheapish with good results.  Great players   Eriksen Lloris Vertongen   High potential and still on the team   Dier Davis Yedlin Alli   Good contributors for a short time (sold at a profit or small loss or still on the team)   Van der Vaart Parker Siggurdson Dembele Adebayor Friedel Dempsey   Reasonable profit   Holtby Pienaar Stambouli? Chiriches?   Negligible loss   Capoue Stambouli? Chiriches?   Most expensive player on that list is Lloris at £11.8m. That's some pretty sensible transfer business in the past 5 years."

coys,3ddjmd,Acentt,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:50:30 2015 UTC,"I was ignoring the obvious flops from the Bale year and forgot about Chadli and Fazio. That said, Chadli and Fazio would fit in short time contributors. Fazio probably hasn't contributed enough to warrant his fee, but I'd say Chadli has.  Jury's still out on Lamela. Soldado and Paulinho are the exceptions that prove the rule. A case could be made that we are not sensible with big transfers, but when it comes to the smaller ones we've really done well."
coys,3ddjmd,superlewis,2,Wed Jul 15 18:44:33 2015 UTC,"Sold ado and Paulino were bad, but I think Lamela has been promising enough to avoid criticism from people who actually pay attention. As far as expensive purchases go, that is."
coys,3ddjmd,smokey815,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:07:47 2015 UTC,"He has flashes of greatness and if he develops as we all hope, I think we'll look back on his purchase as canny insight. But right now it's hard to justify his cost based on what he's actually produced. His trajectory is good but only because it started in such a crap place."
coys,3ddjmd,CyclopsRock,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:19:25 2015 UTC,"It's ridiculous to act like he could have played well enough in two years to hit his price when his price was based on his potential and future play even more than his immediate impact. And when he's hurt for much of the year he was supposed to be acclimation to the leagye, it makes even less sense."
coys,3ddjmd,smokey815,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:05:10 2015 UTC,"Well, I didn't say that. I don't think we need ""£30m worth of football"" out of him in two years. But he's had quite a few games where he has actively played poorly, or otherwise not affected the game much. You can be an unfinished product and have much better seasons than Lamela has, even accounting for his injury."
coys,3ddjmd,CyclopsRock,6,Thu Jul 16 14:19:43 2015 UTC,"Pretty good article, not much really to disagree with. I would, however, add that I'd like to see Milos used as a DM that we could possibly partner with Bentaleb"

coys,3ddjmd,jbungels132,3,Wed Jul 15 15:58:44 2015 UTC,"I don't understand the desire to sell Fazio at all, I thought for the most part he and Vertonghen were an excellent partnership, and if I recall correctly, so did Jan. I don't know what their final tally together was, but at one point we'd gone like 12 games with 1 loss when they were partnered at the back"
coys,3ddjmd,norcalginger,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:07:36 2015 UTC,"That's true. I think it was more than 12. And I'm also sympathetic to keeping him. BUT it's also the case that we often only won by 1 goal and very rarely kept a clean sheet. It's hard to avoid the idea that we were simply outscoring our opponents - which is fine as far as it goes (a win's a win!) but it does suggest there's room for improvement in the defence. It's not like Fazio was some wing back who simultaneously caused us to concede but also score - as far as I can tell, improving our CB should enable us to concede less without impacting our ability to score."

coys,3ddnad,Blubbey,4,Wed Jul 15 13:39:34 2015 UTC,"He also scored 2 over the weekend. The mark of a good player is someone who shows his class against these lower teams. Against that team, you would expect him to step up, stand out and show his quality. Good, he did that. He did it this weekend. That's what this loan is about, more so him showing that he is better than this lower competition, and belongs with the first team."

coys,3dde16,jspegele,18,Wed Jul 15 15:45:38 2015 UTC,"I think real estate investment (among other financial innovations) are where football clubs are going to go in the future to skirt FFP rules. If you're a billionaire Sheikh, and you can't plow a billion pounds into your club, what are you to do? FFP won't let you just put it in the club, and you can't sign shady $500m a year marketing deals like PSG tried to. FFP, however, does let you ignore the cost of ""investment"" in ""infrastructure"". So, billionaire sheikh puts that billion pounds into a couple square blocks of real estate (or put it in a fund of some sort), then the rent from that real estate goes to the club and, over time, his billion pounds makes it into the club's coffers.   We're already doing similar stuff with the NDP - especially the hotels, apartments, grocery store, etc - but it's just a matter of time until football clubs become investment conglomerates to try and get around FFP."
coys,3dde16,albacore_futures,8,Wed Jul 15 13:41:04 2015 UTC,Real Madrid did this.    Money from the king filtered out into property investments which the club magically owns.   No wonder Barce hate them.

coys,3dde16,Berbagod,3,Wed Jul 15 17:26:28 2015 UTC,"There's all kinds of ways to skirt FFP using investments and infrastructure. An oligarch could set up a fund which has a lot of stocks / options / other typical investments, then let the club invest into said fund using preferred shares so the club gets first cut of dividends. Or, he could just straight up sell the fund to the club at a massive loss, effectively moving his assets from himself to the club.   An enterprising oligarch could get even more creative, and sign his players to be personal employees of his in addition to them being ""officially"" employed by the club. If they're personal employees, then he can pay them whatever he wants to personally and it doesn't get accounted for in the club payrolls. So the club pays them a pittance (helping their FFP balance), and the difference gets made up in a second paycheck from the players' second ""jobs."" Bonus points for employing the players in a company which doesn't publicly disclose salary information (aka, any private company) so that nobody knows you're doing what you're doing.  I'm surprised nobody has pushed the financial innovation angle of big clubs and FFP yet, but I'm pretty sure they're going to in the near future, until they're stopped via a rules change."
coys,3dht4w,tomasnz,14,Thu Jul 16 11:37:06 2015 UTC,Then the question will be 'What Belgian midfielder currently playing for Manchester United won't be signing for Tottenham?'
coys,3dht4w,Roshambo2110,3,Thu Jul 16 11:47:09 2015 UTC,or who has the best afro in the PL
coys,3dht4w,MrJDMTyte,12,Thu Jul 16 11:47:41 2015 UTC,"The thing with Fellaini is that he looks like a DM or box to box type player but he really isn't. He played there under moyes for united but was poor, because his best position is further up the pitch as an AM or second striker. He needs to play off a striker to be effective. He's a really weird player, extremely great at what he does but he plays in such a weird position and is only effective in a role I can't think of any other players that compare to him."
coys,3dht4w,briankelllly,2,Thu Jul 16 11:42:25 2015 UTC,he's a really weird player   I kinda see what you mean. He's great going forward (kind of AM like) and can sorta play at DM but we're looking for a SOLID DM
coys,3dht4w,MrJDMTyte,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:33:54 2015 UTC,But are we? I keep hearing reference to the fact that Poche is looking for a double pivot rather than playmaker and DM.  As part of a double pivot would he be interesting?
coys,3dht4w,davedubya,3,Thu Jul 16 13:20:06 2015 UTC,"Not really to be honest, I totally get where you're coming from but like I say, he's never really been good sitting deeper on the pitch. And we need someone who's more inclined to sit back rather than power forward which is where we were getting exposed a lot last season"
coys,3dht4w,mappsy91,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:01:39 2015 UTC,yeah I agree with this in general.
coys,3dht4w,reb_shuff,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:34:41 2015 UTC,Yeah I kinda agree with this... My only comment is that he tackles like a truck. and breaking up play is something he does pretty well.
coys,3dht4w,bpmo,8,Thu Jul 16 11:46:54 2015 UTC,"If the answer is Fellaini, then you're probably asking the wrong question."
coys,3dht4w,reb_shuff,2,Thu Jul 16 13:10:50 2015 UTC,No thanks
coys,3dht4w,Ivan_the_Tolerable,2,Thu Jul 16 11:59:21 2015 UTC,"Fellaini was unreal for Everton, because they played him CAM. No space for him at spurs there, and not as affective in deeper lying positions.  I think we have better CAM options already. Lamela, Eriksen, mason, dembele (on his day) even Kane if we get a better ST.  If we played him CAM then i wouldn't be upset, buit would rather stick to eriksen"
coys,3dht4w,pounro,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:25:16 2015 UTC,true I wasn't really thinking much about him as a CAM (considering our darth there)
coys,3dht4w,TorontoHooligan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:35:07 2015 UTC,Dearth means the opposite of having an abundance of options. It means there's a scarcity.
coys,3dd2oh,DanArlington,3,Wed Jul 15 09:13:05 2015 UTC,I wouldn't be so skeptical. It's pretty much inevitable that big clubs will start to sniff around our youth players. This is what happens when you have a world class academy.  We are going to have to increase the money we pay youth players if we're going to keep some of them. I wouldn't be remotely surprised if we lost Onomah and Marcus Edwards when their peers are making 10x as much as them and their agents are trying to get them to cash in on that.   Luckily our academy is fucking stacked...use that fact as solace when we're unable to keep all of these kids.
coys,3dd2oh,nssmuckers,7,Wed Jul 15 16:26:10 2015 UTC,"Ooh, clickbait!  More clickable than ""Tottenham offer new contract to Josh Onomah as  promising young player continues to develop and moves closer to first-team squad"" I suppose"
coys,3dd2oh,kaleidoscopic82,5,Wed Jul 15 09:52:33 2015 UTC,if it wasnt for Clickbait articles barely anything would get posted in the offseason
coys,3dd03q,mappsy91,18,Wed Jul 15 08:36:51 2015 UTC,Would be good squad rotation players at worst. We play in a lot of competitions
coys,3dd03q,OoohNacerNacerChadli,12,Wed Jul 15 10:24:44 2015 UTC,"Except that last season proved that it wasn't the depth of our squad, but the quality of the starting XI that was holding us back.  Unless players are very young and have stacks of potential or pretty cheap, I don't see the point of dropping these sorts of figures on players like these two if they're not going to substantially improve our first XI."
coys,3dd03q,Buffaluffasaurus,4,Wed Jul 15 13:57:21 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I think McCarthy fits that mold.  He is 24 years old and would be a significant improvement over Ryan Mason as a midfield partner for Bentaleb.  He is strong and plays well defensively but also has the dribbling and passing skills needed to play the position efficiently in the BPL.  His combination of youth, defensive capabilities, and skill on the are hard to come by and something we need."
coys,3dd03q,bassetthound11,4,Wed Jul 15 17:11:25 2015 UTC,"I just don't quite see the player that you do.  He's not bad by any means, but I don't see a substantial difference over Mason, at least not a £20m one anyway.  I feel like there are other players out there - like Clasie, Wijnaldum or Wanyama - who are cheaper and probably better options for us than McCarthy.  I might be wrong, but I feel we could get a lot more for our money elsewhere."
coys,3dd03q,Buffaluffasaurus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:11:34 2015 UTC,"Mate, he is ten fold better than Mason.. Much better defensively, quicker in possession at moving the ball forward, better passing range, both are workhorses.  McCarthy would do the dog work that we have needed. Mason would be a great squad option"
coys,3dd03q,melihs11,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:44:37 2015 UTC,Having better backup players can help our starters. The backups can be played in more competitive cup fixtures and allow our starters to be more rested and allowing them to in theory play better. Also good to have better backups in case of injuries.
coys,3dd03q,OoohNacerNacerChadli,2,Wed Jul 15 17:58:05 2015 UTC,"But we had plenty of backup players last season and Poch hardly used them because they didn't offer enough.  We signed players like Stambouli and Dembele and yet can't find enough reason to even use them in Cup games, and I'm not sure if I feel McCarthy stands a better chance of those two of playing much.  In any case, there's no way we should be dropping 20m on a player who is a backup anyway.  A surefire starter who's much better than what we've got, yes.  But I don't know that McCarthy fits into that category."
coys,3dd03q,Buffaluffasaurus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:15:58 2015 UTC,"Bingo, shouldnt be going anywhere near either of these"
coys,3dd03q,Bravedeini,8,Wed Jul 15 15:38:52 2015 UTC,"Meh, for the reported fees I'm thinking what's the point? To me neither of them represent sizeable upgrades on what we currently have; they don't really improve the first eleven and are just squad alternatives. It sounds reckless, but I would rather give our younger lads (Pritchard etc) more opportunities to step up, or blow £25m on a single prospect (I know it would never happen) rather than £25m on these two where the ceiling is pretty much known."
coys,3dd03q,agonynine,18,Wed Jul 15 10:08:53 2015 UTC,"James McCarthy is only 23. His ceiling could be quite a bit higher, look I can accept Mirallas might not really improve us, I'm unsure about him myself. But I think almost everyone is in agreement we could do with a proper defensive mid, James McCarthy fills that role perfectly for us..."
coys,3dd03q,GerOnBears,5,Wed Jul 15 10:26:14 2015 UTC,"McCarthy would be a great addition, him partnering Bentaleb would be a fantastic midfield! Surely any body who's watched him play 90 minutes for Everton would agree? With him and Toby we could really sort our defensive issues!!"
coys,3dd03q,melihs11,2,Wed Jul 15 12:29:13 2015 UTC,He doesn't have an exotic sounding name so a lot of people on this sub would prefer foreigners with no PL experience (we know how they turned out)  McCarthy would be fantastic
coys,3dd03q,AtLeastImCooler,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:45:38 2015 UTC,I'll admit the only times I watched Everyone last season was against us and their 3-6 thriller loss against Chelsea.  But Everton only conceded like 3 less goals than us last season so how much cover does he really provide for their backline? I know it seems a bit simplistic to merely right him off because of that and maybe it entirely isn't his fault which is why I'm asking. But when I think of Evertons backline I don't think of it lacking quality which is why I'm puzzled why they conceded so much with their backline and with the cover he supposedly provides.
coys,3dd03q,Glasscastle9,2,Thu Jul 16 16:24:05 2015 UTC,"Have heard we are not interested in Mirallas, despite several links. McCarthy is a different story, but he might be expensive."
coys,3dd03q,You_Dont_Know_JackPo,3,Wed Jul 15 10:40:29 2015 UTC,Well I wouldn't be bothered if Mirallas didn't happen. McCarthy is perfect for what we need IMO
coys,3dd03q,JuanPelican,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:45:13 2015 UTC,McCarthy is a step up from Mason in my eyes at least.
coys,3dd03q,Bravedeini,7,Wed Jul 15 10:16:44 2015 UTC,"We lampoon players like Dembele for passing sideways, but McCarthy is possibly the least aggressive passer in the league. Very overrated IMO and I hope we steer clear."
coys,3dd03q,melihs11,2,Wed Jul 15 13:08:18 2015 UTC,Hugely overrated
coys,3dd03q,oblio-of-point,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:39:10 2015 UTC,"This is amazing considering 65% of McCarthy's passes were forward last season. Problem with dembele is he holds on to it far too long because he doesn't have the vision necessary hence the opposition gets 10 men behind the ball by the time Dembele is ready to pass it, only to his CM partner."
coys,3dd03q,its_your_boy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:51:17 2015 UTC,"It's not his job to be an amazing passer, Dembele came to us as an attacking player. Big difference"
coys,3dd03q,MrJDMTyte,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:10:30 2015 UTC,"I don't know what James McCarthy you're watching, but he certainly isn't a sideways passer. The lad has a great eye for a pass. As well as that, he's calm on the ball and for someone his size is a great tackler. Far from over-rated."
coys,3dd03q,bpmo,4,Wed Jul 15 20:08:49 2015 UTC,"where would mirallas play that he would get regular game time?  we have eriksen, chadli and pritchard on the left  on the right we have lamela and townsend (& possibly yedlin)"
coys,3dd03q,theninjanipples,13,Wed Jul 15 09:14:07 2015 UTC,"Well he can generally play on either side from what I've seen... I don't think anyone really wants Eriksen out wide, Pritchard (whilst we all hope he breaks through) is not guaranteed to do well, Townsend and Lamela I like both a lot but they've both been very inconsistent. I think there would be room for him..."
coys,3dd03q,Palienc,4,Wed Jul 15 09:18:16 2015 UTC,He can also play up top and is pretty decent there
coys,3dd03q,agonynine,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:59:10 2015 UTC,"He's not very good up front from what I've seen. Can't stay onside, can't play with his back to goal, and doesn't hold up the ball well. Think he'd be good for us on the wing though."
coys,3dd03q,theninjanipples,4,Wed Jul 15 17:48:04 2015 UTC,"Well, Pritchard is completely unproven and Chadli had lulls in his performances, where he could have benefitted from a rest. He rarely plays centrally, but even if he did, it would be good if Eriksen didn't play every single game. On the right, he's probably been better than both Townsend and Lamela.  Plus, he can actually play striker - so maybe we're going for a two birds, one stone, cover for the left wing and striker, but also knowing he can do a job on the right?"
coys,3dd03q,Doomchicken7,2,Wed Jul 15 09:20:04 2015 UTC,"You might be right, but wouldn't you rather have a player who makes a difference in one position rather than having one who will be ok in both. We have had player who can cover different positions and we haven't gotten better. For example a player like ben yedder or mertens  in the left can give chadli alot of competition and a recognizable forward like benteke ( far reach I know) would see us fight for top four for real."
coys,3dd03q,radawz,2,Wed Jul 15 13:29:35 2015 UTC,Can he play at DM?
coys,3dd03q,brokenairguitar,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:29:47 2015 UTC,"The bottom line is, we aren't always attractive enough to bring in top players - especially if we can't even guarantee them a starting place. Plus, I'd argue he's been much better than Lamela and Townsend. So in that sense, he is an improvement. There's nothing wrong with having some versatility, especially when we literally have only one experienced left midfielder."

Everton finished above Utd so we can finish above Arsenal.   As in, will we be a bigger club? Or is the Arsenal brand too strong to break down, in the same way that the Utd brand appears too strong. Even after coming 7th and 4th they're still the biggest club in England."
coys,3di0xd,combatjohnny,7,Thu Jul 16 13:07:59 2015 UTC,look at the fall of Leeds. any club can collapse no matter how big the brand is if they dont perform on the pitch
coys,3di0xd,Druidoodle,2,Thu Jul 16 13:18:12 2015 UTC,Leeds weren't bringing in £3 million plus every week in their stadium. They collapsed because of poor financial management. Neither United or Arsenal are badly managed
coys,3di0xd,Buffaluffasaurus,5,Thu Jul 16 15:01:29 2015 UTC,"I think it'll be interesting to see how they handle the transition after Wenger, whenever that happens due to firing, retiring or death.  He's been great for them because he's towed the line and not demanded extraordinary transfer kitties, but has always (more or less) delivered.  He even handled some really difficult moments when fans were calling for his head well.  He's not going to be easy to replace, and you'd have to expect they'd suffer a dip in form similar to when Ferguson retired.  Except unlike Utd, they aren't at the moment a top 2 club, and so their grip on the top 4 is a little more tenuous.  Should they drop out of the top 4 for a couple of seasons, they could really struggle to get back in, and that could be a good time to establish ourselves in their place."

Levy has been building the Tottenham 'brand' for a number of years and in developing markets such as the South Africa and more recently (and successfully) in America, with the only setback being when we lost our possible branding powerhouse in Bale.  I think we could one day, but it's going to be a while before we win more trophies than they have. And just basing it on Forbes most valuable football teams, Arsenal are at $1.31bil and Tottenham are worth $600mil, but that's going to shoot up dramatically in the next few years!"

Leeds United finished third in the PL.  Going back through history we've arguably swapped places a few times on who is bigger, certainly post-war. They had the Herbert Chapman years in the 1930's, we had the 50/51 push-and-run team. We're the only team along with Man Utd to have won a trophy in every decade since the 1950's. We had the first modern double in 60/61, they had 70/71. We were the first English club to win a Euro trophy, and have more European trophies than them. They have the George Graham years (and so do we unfortunately!). They have the Invincibles.  Things will change again."

There's the future NFL games at our soon to be first class stadium. I Levy might try sneak a few USA players into the squad again for business reasons in the future too (not just Yedlin).

We were two wins off the top four last season. We could easily have made that up if Soldado and Lamela had played at the standard they are obviously capable of, but we just haven't been able to convert their obvious raw talent onto the pitch. Alternatively, if we hadn't been in the Europa League players wouldn't have been so exhausted come February."

coys,3ddzgx,Everyday_im_redditin,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:50:45 2015 UTC,"I don't know whether it's because there are a lot of newer fans around here, but getting 5th isn't some massive disaster. Yes, the fanbase wants Champions League and the club has made it very clear that is our aim but it's not the end of the world if we don't get it. We've come a long, long way in the past 15 years and we now compete with the big boys without anything close to their cash."
coys,3ddzgx,Spurs94,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:11:17 2015 UTC,"While I would love for us to finish above fifth, it's very difficult.  The problem I have with finishing fifth is there are always three or four games every season that we easily should have won or drawn at least and when we only miss out by 3 or 4 points, it's incredibly frustrating, especially when it reaches that point with 4 or 5 games left to go and you know there is no hope of closing the gap.  I understand that every team loses these games occasionally, but for us it's always one or two more than the top four.  On the other hand, we won a fair few games last season we perhaps shouldn't have, so I suppose it's a fair result for our quality.  I think ultimately it comes down to wanting to feel  like we are putting in a solid effort and if that doesn't work out that's ok, I just hate to see us lose to bottom 5 teams because we played down on their level and those losses or draws costing us fourth or better.  TLDR:  Fifth is ok, but I want us to be fun to watch in the process and keep it close down the stretch.  Also, our defense should be markedly improved this season, so that's a great start."

coys,3de1cc,sirjimmyjazz,7,Wed Jul 15 15:26:30 2015 UTC,"I don't want to toot my own fucking horn, but me and Levy actually worked together on this plan in the back of a Landrover Discovery while he was driving me to the Wimbledon Semi-final after his driver accidentally ran into me at a Zebra crossing.  Long story short, the terms were agreed between Lloris and United, but Levy was looking to Levy them for more cash, and what actually transpired with our combined cunning was that Spurs would help united in their quest to inflate the fee for De Gea, as long as we got a 25% cut of any increase in price. Which WAS essentially the plan.  Now some idiot is plastering it on facebook and it's posted here so obviously Madrid will find out and we will be screwed. Not only that but I'm pretty sure Levy will think I was the one that told everybody and probably won't speak to me again.  The best part of it was, I was going to be able to provide you guys with first hand ultra fresh details about the club. Specifically that although everyone knows about the two pitches in the new stadium, and how the grass rolls away for the NFL pitch, but Levy told me that the NFL pitch rolls away to reveal an ice-hockey rink, and he WAS gong to divulge information about what we will see once the hockey-rink rolls away but that clearly isn't going to happen now is it?  To put it bluntly, when people are trusted with facts like these about the club, it's completely unfair to post these on facebook because anyone could get the blame.  Also, I know what you fucks are like and you are going to think this is all made up. Do some fact checking and it's obvious. Lloris and De Gea are both REAL footballers, We ARE getting a new stadium with retractable pitches. Daniel Levy exists, Landrover Discoverys exist, I'm real because I'm posting this post as well.  Still sceptical? Read the facebook post again, the ITK (and he does know) clearly states it's ""quite the cunning plan"" and above I noted how me and Levy used our cunning (admittedly mostly his) which shows both our version of events clearly line up.  Note: Sorry about my spelling, I'm borrowing Harry Redknapp's iPhone to write this and he's fucked the thing so the autocorrect is actually replacing the right words with the wrong ones."

coys,3da9n6,TonyZeSnipa,-2,Wed Jul 15 10:42:23 2015 UTC,I don't think that they are released.  I think it's a replica jersey.

coys,3da9n6,mrmunchkin62,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:51:56 2015 UTC,Not sure they were hanging up on the wall of kits...
coys,3da9n6,daniel_levy_enic,4,Tue Jul 14 19:05:29 2015 UTC,I haven't seen them in the Underarmour store I work at yet but if you picked it up from one of them you can believe it's an official one. Picked up all 3 kits on clearance + my discount ($60 for all 3) before they all released officially from the club. Underamour's shipment team's are fairly disorganized so mistakes like this happen at every store at least 2-3 times a year of getting product before it's release.
coys,3da9n6,handshakesatsunrise,2,Tue Jul 14 19:12:04 2015 UTC,I can post the tags and more pictures once I get home... it's legit
coys,3da9n6,jhairfield,2,Tue Jul 14 19:13:24 2015 UTC,"I figured it's legit, I'm just addressing the people that may doubt it. I posted pictures of a training kit and the home kit last year and some people dismissed it."
coys,3da9n6,7screws,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:15:11 2015 UTC,Can I give you 60$ and you can buy the kits for me?
coys,3da9n6,coocookuhchoo,2,Tue Jul 14 19:22:29 2015 UTC,"It was a pricing error that was changed within 1 day of them getting shipped out (39.97  + 20% off, then employee 50%).

coys,3dau4u,kwelhouse,2,Wed Jul 15 11:59:01 2015 UTC,You should have done it through a supporters club. Only one person in the group (can only be 2 people) needs to have a Lilywhite membership and the seats will be together. I'd suggest asking your local supporters club chairman to send you the info. They can pretty much guarantee you tickets for B and C matches.

coys,3da9sc,GratisfactionUK,9,Tue Jul 14 18:44:41 2015 UTC,"Perfect combination between skill and power, can break up defenses bang them in from any angle. Has more potential than Benteke, Lukaku and Origi in the long run. Had some mental issues in the past but has massively improved in the last year. When Benteke was out for the WC with an injury, everyone expected Batshuayi to be called up. He scores high on the HurriKane-scale.  Most of all, he's a very cheerful guy that everyone loves. And he likes Spongebob, a lot."
coys,3da9sc,Beerkar,5,Tue Jul 14 20:28:10 2015 UTC,"I haven't watched him much but I've been looking into the stats and he seems pretty damn good. Here are the bullet points:   .9 goals per 90 minutes played. That's the highest rate in Ligue 1, and on par with Aguero, Costa, Remy, Cisse in the PL. 2.1 successful dribbles per 90. For a forward, that's only behind Sterling, Aguero, Perez in the PL; and Fekir and Martial in Ligue 1. 0 assists, but .9 key passes per 90 (passes leading to shots). So he's not a big provider, but that's the same number as Harry Kane. Fairly average.   Of course, per 90 stats for substitutes are skewed higher due to fresh legs, among other things - see Remy and Cisse. But in the 6 games he started last season (only two of which he finished the full 90) he scored 3 goals. Still a very respectable return.  He thrived under Bielsa; hopefully Poche's system is similar. That plus being Belgian could potentially mean he'd be comfortable slotting right in.  The only snag I see is that Marseille's squad is kind of falling apart, with Gignac, Imbula, Ayew, and Payet all leaving. I'd guess they'd be hesitant to sell, at least until they can acquire a decent replacement striker."

coys,3da6wk,Doomchicken7,5,Tue Jul 14 19:41:07 2015 UTC,The only concern I have with him is that he's such a physical player. Physical players tend to do very well in youth leagues due to their advantage in strength and height - it's how Chelsea beat us in the FAYC - but obviously this advantage doesn't carry over to the seniors too well.
coys,3da6wk,raging_monkey_pit,2,Wed Jul 15 01:38:56 2015 UTC,"You're right, but tbf he did handle the U-20 World Cup pretty well, he was one of the youngest there."

Although he's a converted RM, he's very solid defensively. He's also very focused and composed. He reminds me a little bit of Corluka, except he's way, way faster.

Of course, you're missing many important names. That was a fan vote. Gerrard and Lampard are ""commissioners picks"". They're weren't even recognized in the fan vote and look at the comments in the /r/MLS thread about the team, everyone is laughing at the fact Gerrard and Lampard were picked.

Actually no, he is. He just came off a Champions League Final.   All Star games in North America aren't reserved for the biggest names in the sport. You have to earn your spot and then maybe if the fans and coaches are in your favour, you get the place in the game. Gerrard and Lampard aren't a fan vote, and I'm fucking sure any sane coach wouldn't pick them despite not playing a single minute."
coys,3d8xmv,djmooselee,7,Tue Jul 14 14:42:50 2015 UTC,"Alright, riddle me this. Going off of what you're saying, how come Pirlo isn't there? I mean isn't he arguably a bigger star? Actually no, he is. He just came off a Champions League Final.   So you think Pirlo is more famous in the US than Lampard and Gerrard? Not a chance in hell. Is he a better player? Yes, obviously. And regarding why Pirlo isn't there, how am I supposed to know? He might have declined? He might have demanded a vacation before he started? Like I said, I've no idea but it's not really that hard to imagine that Pirlo wouldn't be that interested in playing a pointless friendly against Spurs when he could be resting or training for his real debut.   All Star games in North America aren't reserved for the biggest names in the sport. You have to earn your spot and then maybe if the fans and coaches are in your favour, you get the place in the game.    No? Then why was Gerrard and Lampard picked? Get your arguments straight."
coys,3d8xmv,phoenixcolt,2,Tue Jul 14 15:44:24 2015 UTC,"Position wise he wasn't needed...  This game is for the fans ... And more  importantly, to make new fans .. That's why the new imports are on display"
coys,3d8xmv,TomCosella,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:03:37 2015 UTC,I don't watch the MLS.  Many American soccer fans don't watch the MLS.  The All-Star game is about growing the sport and providing a spectacle.  The way to do that is to get players people know playing.  No one wants to watch Benny Feilhaber or Obafemi Martins play.  Yeah Lampard and Gerrard aren't what they once were but the names are bigger than the talent when it comes to PR and getting fans interested in your league.
coys,3d8xmv,combatjohnny,0,Tue Jul 14 15:23:50 2015 UTC,"Trust me, the majority of MLS fans are furious about this.  MLS could have the best player in the world, but if he weren't a retired EPL/La Liga star or if he's was in somewhere like Columbus, they don't give half a damn about advertising him."
coys,3d8xmv,airz23s_coffee,-3,Tue Jul 14 17:54:12 2015 UTC,how can they be the biggest stars if they havent even played 90 minutes?!
coys,3d8xmv,superradwalkman,9,Tue Jul 14 12:59:33 2015 UTC,Because Gerrard and Lampard are global names.  The all star game is about ratings.
coys,3d8xmv,mrmunchkin62,6,Tue Jul 14 13:03:16 2015 UTC,"They are still the biggest stars based on their past and name recognition... Why is that so hard to understand? It's an ""All-star"" game, they are two, if not the two biggest stars in that leauge."
coys,3d8xmv,combatjohnny,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:13:15 2015 UTC,"Because they haven't proven anything in the mls. It's not a world all star side, its mls all stars."
coys,3d8xmv,coysian,-2,Tue Jul 14 13:18:42 2015 UTC,"I'm clearly struggling with the concept. I thought an All star game was to recognise the best player in the league, if they haven't played in the league how can they be two of the best players? surely they are taking two other peoples place who have been playing well so far this season."
coys,3d8xmv,combatjohnny,3,Tue Jul 14 13:18:40 2015 UTC,"You're right conceptually, most other sports all-star teams are based on that season's performances.  I think they're trying to leverage the fact that a lot of American Spurs/PL fans will be in attendance/watching on tv, most of which couldn't really give a shit about MLS.  This is their attempt to get them interested.  It's definitely more about exposure and growth than rewarding top performers at this point.  On one hand you can see how that's kinda fucked up, but on the other if they want to keep the league growing quickly this probably isn't such a bad idea."
coys,3d8xmv,superradwalkman,0,Tue Jul 14 13:32:58 2015 UTC,I can see why they are doing it but to me it feels cheap and tacky. Neither of them will be fully fit so it will only be a cameo appearance at best. surely they could of played in next season game and given a couple of lesser none lads a chance to shine against Spurs.
coys,3d8xmv,TorontoFC15,5,Tue Jul 14 13:35:22 2015 UTC,"cheap and tacky   We are talking about an ""all-star"" game, the whole concept is cheap and tacky. It's a promotional event."
coys,3d8xmv,superradwalkman,2,Tue Jul 14 13:37:30 2015 UTC,"You're correct. If you look at this XI selected by the fans most tof them have done exceptionally well this season. However, Gerrard and Lampard weren't selected by the fans, they're the ""commissioners picks"" which is a load of shit. They have a grand whopping total of 0 combined minutes in the league. It's part of a whole scheme of ""welcome Gerrard and Lampard"". It's so fucking bullshit.   The entire all star game is just a popularity contest. The initial 11 players are selected by the fans. Not necessarily the best in the league. Many players (Giovinco...) are missing out but will hopefully be picked by the coaches picks.  The whole all-star concept is a cheap gimmick, I wish it would just go away. Sure the other leagues in NA do it but doesn't mean MLS should have to as well."
coys,3d8xmv,Aphroditeishot,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:54:15 2015 UTC,"I get what you are saying and I'm not saying that I disagree but why is it so hard to understand that Lampard and Gerrard are stars in the MLS based on their past? It's a friendly game, no one really gives a shit about it. It's just a way to promote the MLS and they'll obviously put their biggest names on display."
coys,3d8xmv,waffuls1,3,Tue Jul 14 13:36:02 2015 UTC,Pretty sure it's the MLS trying to show who they have playing. Big names will always be put in the All-Star team to show the MLS is growing.

coys,3d8xmv,mopic,0,Tue Jul 14 13:19:11 2015 UTC,I meant the whole league in general.

coys,3d8xmv,davedubya,2,Tue Jul 14 13:38:47 2015 UTC,I think it's a good thing to be playing a lot of veteran international players. They have nothing to prove so there will (hopefully) be less dangerous tackles. Pray that Charlie Adam doesn't sign for an MLS club in the next week.

coys,3d8omg,dirtyewok,17,Tue Jul 14 11:06:19 2015 UTC,The Daily Star is among the least credible sources around.  That said Andros being a target for Sunderland (and Villa) had been floating around for a few weeks so it isn't surprising that the story would expand to include NUFC as Townsend seems like a player that would fit what McClaren would like to have available.
coys,3d8omg,Blubbey,4,Tue Jul 14 11:16:09 2015 UTC,"Apart from the bbc, sky sports and possibly the guardian and di marzio it's best to assume everything's rubbish."
coys,3d8omg,CharlieBurkeE4,5,Tue Jul 14 11:20:17 2015 UTC,I really don't think we should sell him he brings depth that we need in that area of the field.
coys,3d8omg,SirMothy,8,Tue Jul 14 16:34:12 2015 UTC,If we sell Townsend for 15mil that's classic Levy
coys,3d8omg,Spurs94,3,Tue Jul 14 12:56:48 2015 UTC,"I know Poch wants inverted wingers but I feel like it's madness Townsend isn't pushed over to the left. He has all the physical potential in the world to succeed, he just needs to do the simple things well and he could be incredibly effective."
coys,3d8omg,swiper33,5,Wed Jul 15 02:06:26 2015 UTC,15 mil for Townsend just cause he's English is ridonkilous
coys,3d8omg,popoley4221998,2,Tue Jul 14 13:21:37 2015 UTC,"English tax is definitely a factor but I reckon Levy's more to blame.  Guy lives for transfer season. He'd be a brilliant used car dealer.  Wouldn't put it past him to be able to sell a Mondeo for £25,000."
coys,3d8omg,I_am_Wheeler,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:43:06 2015 UTC,IMO this guy seems like he's pretty much peaked. He's got the physicality but whenever we give him chances he scores one miraculous goal and then spends the rest of the season trying to replicate that by taking poor shots and missing constantly. If we really want to be a champions league team we can't be relying on players like Townsend. Getting that much for a player who really hasn't proved much would be a steal.
coys,3d8omg,SHPKG,8,Tue Jul 14 16:40:55 2015 UTC,"He turns 24 in two days, I think it's pretty harsh to say he's peaked. Will he ever be a winger who bangs in 20 league goals? Maybe not, but at the same time, he has a lot of the attributes that those types of players tend to have and there's still ample time to grow into that. Young players aren't consistent, even the very best have lows among the highs.  Look at Robben for example -- and I'm not trying to say Townsend will be Robben (whose league best goal tally is 17) -- in his three Premier League seasons before he turned 25, he scored 7 in 18 (04/05), 6 in 28 (05/06) and 2 in 21 (06/07). Those are hardly statistics that would make you think he'd turn into one of the three best wingers in the world at age 28. £15M would obviously be a Levytastic return for Townsend, but it doesn't mean he won't someday get to that valuation."
coys,3d8omg,mappsy91,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:00:29 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I do not understand the shit Townsend gets. Yes he is inconsistent and a little frustrating at times, but he's nowhere near as bad as people seem to think..."

Unless the club is trying to tap someone up, which they all avoid now if possible, they are all extremely quiet up until the point that it is completed or if they are unhappy about what is going on.  I think that most rumors, that we all fall for, are created by journalists or so-called ""ITK's"" as a way to get attention.  The ones that have legs like the Alderweirld talk before the switch could also come from agents who use it to influence deals, or from someone else who may be more susceptible to giving out information as the deal moves ahead (i.e. training ground employees, administration people in the club, etc.)  That being said, it's quiet at the moment because there are other bigger news stories going on so there aren't any slow news days at the moment, and the activity going on from a high-level corporate perspective is as visible as it should be, non-existent."

coys,3d8mzt,mpw90,13,Tue Jul 14 10:42:57 2015 UTC,"As a Spurs fan for many years now, I've really felt things have started to change in the past year or two. I think, finally, Levy has realized that Spurs can't keep pulling rabbits out of the hat in the transfer market and compete with the oil money of Man City or Chelsea, or the massive revenues of Arsenal or Man Utd. So, the club has shifted gear. I think this thinking has crystallized with the arrival of Poch -- it seems Levy really has faith in a coach for the first time in a long while, and the fruits are there to see in terms of player development (Rose has improved beyond belief under Poch) and emergence of young homegrown stars (you're a wizard, Harry).  As a fan, I've rarely been happier.   Sure, it was a great ride for a while under Redknapp, but it never felt it would last and sure enough it didn't. I'm prepared to be patient and let the club grow, literally, with the building of the new stadium, and take a long view that heavy minutes now to the likes of Kane, Bentaleb, Dier, Mason, Pritchard, Onomah, etc.., is the only way that the club is eventually going to build up the strength to really compete with the biggest clubs. Even if that will feel hard to remember following the inevitable 0-1 home defeat by Stoke after the Europa League."
coys,3d8mzt,kaleidoscopic82,3,Tue Jul 14 10:55:00 2015 UTC,"What's interesting is that to build that training complex, it wouldn't have happened in a few years, it would have involved finding a place, buying it, getting planning permission, building it, and all other areas involved.  This would have been a long ol' game. So, I think he was actually ahead in that sense."
coys,3d8mzt,kaleidoscopic82,8,Tue Jul 14 10:59:19 2015 UTC,"There was an interesting criticism from Damien Commolli, who I don't always trust but feel he sometimes has worthwhile points to make, when he said that Spurs had built this amazing facility, but weren't really using it. Not enough specialist coaches and expertise was his point, and that chimes with the stories you'd hear about Redknapp's old-fashioned training methods and also the stories of Sherwood sitting in the canteen all day, leading players to nickname it ""The Pub"".  So the vision was there, but I think in Poch, Levy has finally found someone with the passion for training and player development that can make a facility like that worthwhile. Maybe Levy thought AVB would be that man, but turns out he wasn't. Without that mentality, all the training complex is is a fancy building. I think that's the point I'm making about Levy's thinking crystallizing under Pochettino -- I don't think Levy has ever lacked the vision, it's just he's never been quite clear on how to execute it.  Again, let's all try and remember this positivity after that 0-1 home defeat by Stoke."

coys,3d8mzt,kaleidoscopic82,4,Tue Jul 14 11:48:42 2015 UTC,I like my pre-season optimism served with a dash of grim reality and inevitability
coys,3d8mzt,busstopboxer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:15:18 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure the new training facility didn't open until a while after Redknapp and Commolli had left, so I doubt that's what he would have been talking about."
coys,3d8mzt,Roshambo2110,8,Wed Jul 15 07:20:26 2015 UTC,"IMO, the game has changed; until only a few seasons ago, a benefactor could buy a club like a Man City or a Blackburn, throw a few hundred million at it and see instant success on the pitch.  However, as the money coming into the game has gone through the roof in the last 2 PL TV deals and the increased finance from abroad, it has become more than just player + wages. If you look at Manchester City, they have that but they also have the facilities, the stadium and the international presence. To compete with that 'overnight' (and I mean that in terms of a few seasons or so...) you're looking at the best part of, if not more than, £1BN. In reality, there's only a few people or companies on the planet with that sort of clout.  So, what does one do? You try and compete on the back-end, building the infrastructure of the club and brand, and work towards building the additional revenue streams and consistency off the pitch which will hopefully build and compliment that on the pitch.  In these terms, the club is doing what it should be, IMO; the training complex appears to be incredibly well regarded by the number of high-profile visitors we've had, and the players, and the NFL deal and new stadium take it that next step further.  Instant gratification is really a subjective term, but I totally understand what you mean. I was a season ticket holder under the Francis, Graham and Hoddle eras so for me, what we have now in terms of profile and expectation is beyond my wildest expectations. Whether we sign 'X' player for £30m is incredibly short-sighted; it makes far more sense from a point of view of squad harmony and ethos, finance and because the fans love to 'grow' a player to create rather than purchase a 'superstar' to buy players and make them more than they were when they came - Bale, Modric, Carrick. Fans are so quick to look for a quick answer but it always mystifies me; so many of our 'big  'signings', even in relative terms, have been terrible mis-fires. From Dumitrescu to Rebrov to Pavulychenko (although that might be slightly harsh) to recent flops like Paulinho, Soldado et al. It's when we - and all clubs - are smart in the market that we operate best. Obviously you want 'big' players but as I said in the other thread, once you factor in wages, someone like Schneiderlin works out at £50m and that just isn't realistic for a club like ours, nor is it prudent.  Anyway apologies for rambling! Hope that makes sense - I'm typing on my phone"
coys,3d8mzt,kaleidoscopic82,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:27:36 2015 UTC,"Both well-typed and well-argued...  I think, for the first time, in Harry Kane we have a star player who I'm confident Levy WON'T sell, and the club can actually start to really build around with a long-term view in mind. This summer has been sensible again -- rebuilding the defense, which was shocking last season, and is surely more of a priority than trying to upgrade Lamela or Townsend in attacking midfield position, however tempting that is. One step at a time, even if it may seem a little boring to a fanbase used to fancy foreign wingers.  Oh, and agree on Pavlychenko -- I thought he was absolutely terrible!"
coys,3d8mzt,SirMothy,6,Tue Jul 14 11:34:18 2015 UTC,Pav was inconsistent but provided us much more then Soldado.
coys,3d8mzt,theninjanipples,3,Tue Jul 14 13:00:49 2015 UTC,"Pav was actually pretty good for us, and has a respectable goals to minute ratio - he was just unlucky in that he didn't get many opportunities. When he did, he'd look unspectacular, but usually do a decent job. Scored a few important goals too."
coys,3d8mzt,drunkwithanxiety,3,Tue Jul 14 23:24:50 2015 UTC,"You play the hand your dealt is basically my thought on the matter.  Silent Joe and Action Dan have decided that Spurs should be fiscally rewarding and successful on the pitch at the same time. They own the only middle-class club in England: too small to be big, too big to be small.  Given that two plans must be executed:  1 - Embiggen the club financially  2 - Be younger (and cheaper) than the clubs you're chasing  Plan 1 is well-underway - new stadium, increased efforts at marketing overseas and at home, getting some NFL dollars, probably a bunch of other stuff I don't know about.  Plan 2 - It seems like they've finally come to their senses here - the Bale money might have actually delayed Plan 2 because, hey, who wouldn't think that all that money might buy you into the top 4? But it didn't, so now, buying stars 1 - 2 years ahead of their stardom is the new plan (which, of course, is a difficult thing to do, to prognosticate development of talent).  Buying younger players and locking them in (if you choose the right young players!) means you get more bang for your buck.  So........I'm excited.  I think this is the best plan - to acquire a lot of youth talent, and then explode onto the scene in our ""it's-bigger-than-the-Emirates"" stadium (you know that will be its unofficial name for many fans) with a cohesive team of fully developed talent entering their primes."
coys,3d8mzt,hovAdov,3,Tue Jul 14 14:37:10 2015 UTC,"Upvote for use of 'embiggen', very cromulent of you."
coys,3d8mzt,chrish1023,3,Tue Jul 14 22:05:39 2015 UTC,"I pray that we never take the route that Man City of Chelsea have taken. Once you start pumping cash into a club, the expectation is to win every season and anything less is a disappointment. That's just not fun. Being a fan is about the joy that you get watching your team play and that is always elevated when you don't expect anything from a match.   What happened after Bale was a fluke. Levy realized that he had fucked up a few consecutive transfer windows and was intent on keeping the club in the position we were (plus we had money to spend). From now on you can expect his transfers to follow the same pattern of the last two windows. Which I'm totally fine with; our academy players have done just as well as our transfers.   TLDR; Levy is doing all the rights things at the moment and we will be a force to be reckoned with once the stadium is built."
coys,3d8mzt,SZJX,2,Tue Jul 14 16:02:08 2015 UTC,"What are there to compare about? They got sugar daddies, we don't. That's it. Just like if you got a super rich dad you don't have to do anything just live your life however you want, while we have to fight a lot for everything. It's just that simple in the current world. Of course if you're talking which club's fan you're ""choosing to be"" then it makes a bit more sense: Better follow a club with shrewd real-world business operations and actual highs and lows instead of bandwagoning. Otherwise I don't get your point.   Or I guess to put it more precisely ENIC aren't poor. It's just that they're proceeding with Spurs in a business way instead of treating it as a black hole of money like Abramovich does."

coys,3d6cyo,GerOnBears,25,Tue Jul 14 09:33:49 2015 UTC,I watch OM some. He's really talented but would be another project player. I just don't see him as ready for the premier league.   Plus with all of the players heading out of OM this summer I can't see them selling him as he'll be their top striker.
coys,3d6cyo,evilchucky999,44,Mon Jul 13 21:49:11 2015 UTC,"Might have to take a project as backup striker, cuz theyre probably the only type of player who will be happy to play rotation"
coys,3d6cyo,mrmunchkin62,5,Mon Jul 13 22:13:35 2015 UTC,"Do you think he would be a good backup for Kane though? We don't need him to instantly score 20 goals in his first premier league season, so I don't really see a problem with signing him, even if he's still not fully developed. I've heard a lot of good things about Batshuayi, so I think he would be a decent investment. But I've never actually seen him play, so I can't really tell if he would suit our style of play."
coys,3d6cyo,TheSmellOfSilence,16,Mon Jul 13 22:02:50 2015 UTC,"I'm going to preface this with clarifying the I watch OM some that I stated in my first comment. I watched maybe around 10 games last year so I would not consider myself an expert by any means.  I mean it's just so hard to predict. He's strong and fast with pretty good technique and the one thing going for him in terms of being a backup is that he actually came on as a sub for OM a lot and scored a lot when coming on. He was behind Gignac the majority of the season but still made the most of his chances.   Also he is coming from playing under Marcelo Beilsa (Poch's mentor) which is an extra plus.  Definitely a better option than a lot of the names that have been thrown out there, I just hope it's not too early for him.   I would be excited if he comes but it may be hard to get Marseille to sell for the reason I mentioned above and for that £9m price seeing as he was bought the year before for £6m"
coys,3d6cyo,evilchucky999,5,Mon Jul 13 22:21:38 2015 UTC,He bailed Marseille's ass so much last season. Says a lot that they trusted him enough to let Gignac go. He won't go for cheap though.

coys,3da03w,KarryHane,18,Tue Jul 14 17:39:15 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I wouldn't blame any Spurs fans for not knowing the origins of our team. It's very obscure, but bloody interesting.  For those interested in why we are called Tottenham Hotspur (Or just a massive history geek like me):    On Tuesday 5 September 1882, the Hotspur Football Club was formed by grammar-school boys from the Bible class at All Hallows Church. They were also members of Hotspur Cricket Club. It is possible that the name Hotspur was associated with Sir Henry Percy, who was ""Harry Hotspur"" of Shakespeare's Henry IV, part 1, and who lived locally during the 14th century and whose descendants owned land in the neighbourhood. In 1884 the club was renamed Tottenham Hotspur Football Club to avoid any confusion with an already established team called Hotspur FC.    And the origin story of our crest:    Since the 1901 FA Cup final the Tottenham Hotspur crest has featured a cockerel. Harry Hotspur (from whom the club is said to take its name) was famed for his riding spurs, and fighting cocks were fitted with spurs, which can be seen in the crests. In 1909 a former player named William James Scott made a bronze cast of a cockerel standing on a football to be placed on top of the West Stand and since then the cockerel and ball have been the major part of the club's identity."

Spurs has been operating with a surplus for years. All the other clubs the ""writer"" lists were sold accompanied with huge debt-obligations. Liverpool were forcibly sold as their debtors took them to court."
coys,3d9x1r,p_gascoigne,-4,Tue Jul 14 18:34:22 2015 UTC,"I did, actually. And I'm honestly not really sure what you're getting at.  Yes, Spurs have a neat balance book and are a financially sound club -- but that doesn't mean that some didn't think that Spurs valuation at £1 billion was still too much. As for the other club sales that I referenced, I used those as points of reference for why some felt that way.   Furthermore, while Liverpool's debt obligations prior to their sale were well known, United didn't have an excessive amount of debt when they were purchased. The debt was taken on via the means by which the Glazers purchased the club. It very well could be that whomever eventually purchases Spurs would need to take on considerable debt in order to fund their purchase, especially with an asking price as high as it is. And Spurs do have a Gross Debt of £35m of their own that they're carrying by the way, which would likely be accounted for in any sale as well."
coys,3d9x1r,wrongsideofpond,4,Tue Jul 14 19:20:43 2015 UTC,"Sorry about the garbage comment. But, the meat of your article is built on a logical fallacy along with a few false conclusions. The main  argument of the piece rests upon a straw-man argument: Where exactly are these fans that are so upset about making money from our stadium?  Then, the argument that 1bn was pushing, it is built on a false premise.   Man. Utd. was taken over incrementally, and was only possible due to internal legal and political difficulties. It is not as if there was a unified entity that the Glazer took over from.  Liverpool was taken to court over debts, so not exactly a hot commodity at the time.  Now, on to why Lewis was not making an unreasonable demand:   Just the TV deals are worth a third of a billion GBP for each club at the moment. It will probably be worth even more next time it is negotiated.  The season prior to said take-over attempt, a single player was sold for almost a 100 m. GBP. We have been running a surplus for quite some time now, and we are still performing welll Being a London club our land is worth a whole lot, both the stadium and training field  The contracts of the players are worth several hundred millions Lastly, ENIC has holds a majority of the shares of the club"
coys,3d9x1r,p_gascoigne,-5,Tue Jul 14 19:51:59 2015 UTC,"It's not really a false premise or straw man, seeing as how there was at least one ""person"" that thought the price was too high: and that's the Cain Hoy group. If they hadn't thought it was too high, wouldn't they have ended up buying the club instead of backing off?   And to be honest, that wasn't the entire point of the article. The theory was that this move could potentially have been made -- at least in part -- as a way to make the club more attractive to potential suitors. Which obviously needed to happen because nobody has met the price that ENIC wanted yet."
coys,3d9x1r,wrongsideofpond,5,Tue Jul 14 20:14:57 2015 UTC,"The straw-man is that people (Spurs-fans) are upset about sharing the stadium with a NFL-team twice a year.  ENIC are not actively looking for buyers.   So your argument is like claiming Barcelona is incorrectly valuing Messi as City, Chelsea or PSG have not yet signed him.  Lewis, along with the rest of ENIC, obviously know that Spurs is worth a whole lot, and not really worthwhile selling unless someone coughs up a billion or more."
coys,3d9x1r,p_gascoigne,-3,Tue Jul 14 20:18:15 2015 UTC,"Well for starters, if you watched Twitter at all the day the announcement was made, there were plenty of negative reactions from fans and non-fans. I didn't bother to dig them out because that would be very time consuming and I have a job. And if you look in this very subreddit, there were negative comments about it here too.  Secondly, I never claimed ENIC were looking for buyers. I did claim that they would be willing to sell, provided their valuation was met. Otherwise, why announce a selling price? And just as with Barcelona, they're allowed to name whatever valuation they please. But just because they haven't sold yet, that doesn't mean they aren't willing to sell.  And lastly, it's just a theory, dude. I never once claimed that this was exactly what was going to happen. You're acting like I'm claiming it all as fact when I'm just drawing conclusions from a set of potential scenarios."

And pardon me for being defensive when you first complaint out of the gate was to call it garbage and question me as a ""writer"". You even continued to be demeaning in this latest comment by continuing to point out my ""fallacies"".   I heard the points you were making, and then provided evidence to defend my position. Which, by the way, you brushed aside simply due to the ratio of positive to negative not meeting some threshold you determined. You then added additional complaints, which you didn't include before, and I defended again -- as is my right to do so."
coys,3d9x1r,wrongsideofpond,3,Tue Jul 14 21:00:19 2015 UTC,"Here is the set-up you give:   Predictably, many have rallied against the deal.  Those in the “Against Modern Football” movement loved to hate on this deal. There’s the anti-American movement, too. Some of my American brethren with anti-NFL stances thought such a deal would tarnish the club’s legacy.   But, in reality, what happened is that a huge majority of fans rallied behind it. Watch the last episode of Last Week Tonight as to what the reason is why nobody is opposed to this.   the ratio of positive to negative not meeting some threshold   ???  The thread is literally packed with comments about how Daniel Levy is a genius. One commenter is worried about the design. A second is claiming Levy is some money-grabbing monkey. To use their voices to fuel your own argument is exactly what a ""straw-man argument"" entails."
coys,3d9x1r,p_gascoigne,0,Tue Jul 14 21:13:14 2015 UTC,"Are we really playing semantics here? You asked for evidence of people who were against it, and in that very thread, there were a handful of negative comments. You didn't say, ""Show me a thread where a majority of the comments were against the Stadium Deal"".   Predictably, many have rallied against the deal.   Many =/= All, which is what you're attempting to imply I said. Which I didn't. And if we're really going to play the semantics game...   Watch the last episode of Last Week Tonight as to what the reason is why nobody is opposed to this.   ""Nobody"" is a pretty strong word here, especially when the thread I linked to above had some objections. And that's just one example.  Obviously, your opinion on the matter is different than mine. And I'm perfectly okay with that. I'm just highlighting evidence to support my line of thinking, which you don't seem to be okay with at all.

But I hope Spurs aren't sold with the promising outlook that we have at the moment or that if they are the new potential owner doesn't fiddle too much but pumps in the cash to make them major players in the European market.

B) They do play different roles, astute observation, but I'm not sure what point you were trying to make with that.  C) Bale played LB, LW, AM, RW, and I think we even tried him at striker. Meanwhile Luka has a well defined role as a playmaker who sits deep in the midfield, and if I recall he struggled mightily when 'Arry tried to play around with where on the pitch Luka played.

Also, the only person with enough hubris to think that he can fix a player like Adebayor (who seems to still be on extended holiday in Africa) would be Tactics Tim.    Please, take him off our hands.  I really think the ideal scenario is to have our striker core be Kane, a pacey player that can player LWF or FW, Soldado, and either a new youth option or one of our existing youth options who is ready for first team duty.  I know Soldado will probably never come good, but he gets on well with the players and he's got a lot of experience."

Partially because I wan't him to come good and tear it up like a motherfucker.  However without the aforementioned tearing up taking place, he is a great role model for younger players. The fact that most people still support him despite 2 pretty much horrendous seasons in terms of goals scores shows that fans value work rate, effort, and loyalty as much as anything else.  For example Kane can look at Soldado and know that even if he hits a dry patch, that hard work and determination will keep the fans onside.  On the flip side you have Adebayor, a player who a lot of people dislike, even when he is putting away goals for fun."

Gardener had a few good moments but was ultimately not a very bright or positionally sound defender.  Amazingly he played once for England!  Thelwell just dropped down the leagues, I think partly due to injury problems.  Like...really dropped through the leagues.  Think he was non-league last time I checked.

Yes, I am bitching about an advertisement in Colorado.  The location doesn't matter, the advertisement is ignorant and solipsistic.  This is exactly the sort of thing that annoys a lot of Canadians.  Would it be fair play to use St. George's Cross as a representation of a pan-UK organization?  I'm sure Scots would love that.  Sure, US-Canadian history isn't nearly as fraught as Anglo-Scottish history, but the principle is the same.  I don't actually care that much ... I am disappointed in MLS and/or Dick's Sporting Goods Park, because this looks to be an official advertisement, and they should know better ... but although this advert is offensive, it's also trivial.    But it was enough to raise an eyebrow, and frankly, I'm stunned that more people on this sub don't feel that way.  Yeah, great, it's clever, but it's in bad taste.

coys,3d1vbo,SiPadreYall,4,Mon Jul 13 06:15:26 2015 UTC,"I don't care if he's American, I've been vocal on the massive delusion of some of our American fans regarding him. I honestly can't believe some people on here hold him in the same regard as Kane, bentaleb, Pritchard."
coys,3d1vbo,BubSwatPunt,3,Mon Jul 13 12:15:25 2015 UTC,"American here. Can confirm some are delusional. However, to properly understand the Yid of Yank, its important for the Brit to know that most of us are simply overjoyed about someone from the country we love playing for the club we love. It gives us a deeper connection to Spurs, and one that quite honestly is hard to come by in any EPL team. It's just really exciting for us. And therefore we desperately WANT him to succeed. Not because he is better (because he isnt... honestly I think a loan would be beneficial if it means starting weekly) but because he is a compatriot of ours. He is, to borrow one of our hymns, one of our own. Not Jesus... not Maradona... not Kane... simply one of us. And that makes us very proud, in a motherly ""soccer-mom"" kind of way. Now then... knowing the root of such over-zealousness, and forgiving any  overhype that stems from such as our hearts for club and country....Carry on."

Especially ITK that merely confirms things that any idiot could conclude from watching the player for 10 minutes. This kind of crap tends to result in confirmation bias and agendas.  Yedlin is at the moment a nothing player in a position we are well-equipped at, yet he is the subject of an embarrassing amount of ""ITK"" and speculation. I wonder why."
coys,3d1vbo,WillSpur,3,Mon Jul 13 07:29:09 2015 UTC,"I think you're spot on here, but will continue to be downvoted most likely. Yedlin is not a player I'm concerned about, positively or negatively, at the moment."

I really wanna believe in Dembele this season. I really really really do. I believe he's a incredibly talented player with just appalling decision making at times. But that period of domination we had in the middle of the season showed how classy he could be, and then he fell off the face of the earth after the West Ham game.

coys,3d1kyn,sirjimmyjazz,50,Sun Jul 12 22:02:52 2015 UTC,You can't just use stats. From watching both players I'd say Sterling is significantly better and is much younger as well. It seems everyone has forgotten that Sterling is one of England's best players and has world class potential.
coys,3d1kyn,luckster44,20,Sun Jul 12 20:09:57 2015 UTC,"Plus they're different players.  Sterling played last season in a team with no real striking threat once Sturridge was out injured, and so when you see that his ""chances created"" column is nearly twice that of Chadli, you can see he was a big creative threat with no one to actually finish what he was doing.  Chadli did great on the goals front, but he offers comparatively little else, whereas Sterling is a fast, pressing threat all across the front line."
coys,3d1kyn,Buffaluffasaurus,4,Sun Jul 12 21:23:45 2015 UTC,They also play a completely different position in completely different systems. Chadli gets the job done but I'd take sterling over him every day of the week.
coys,3d1kyn,fatguylilcoat_,4,Mon Jul 13 01:12:37 2015 UTC,I'm so glad to find this view not only stated but accepted on this sub. It seems like most of fans have forgotten he's one of the best young talents in the world over the course of the last couple of months.
coys,3d1kyn,_Sagacious_,3,Sun Jul 12 22:16:53 2015 UTC,It seems like everyone has completely ignored sterlings chances created numbers too.
coys,3d1kyn,WillSpur,3,Sun Jul 12 23:21:30 2015 UTC,Sterling is a great young player with heaps of potential. But I have some Liverpool fan friends who are actually for selling him. They don't see much progress and believe he is overhyped. They would rather sell high now and re-invest. I personally haven't seen him enough to say if his development has slowed. But interesting to know some Liverpool fans aren't really that high on him.
coys,3d1kyn,nrolo24,3,Sun Jul 12 20:18:21 2015 UTC,I think Liverpool would be ludicrous not to sell him for the offers City has reportedly given them. I don't think he really has a future relationship with Rodgers. His value's insane right now because of his age.
coys,3d1kyn,tabelz,0,Sun Jul 12 20:44:36 2015 UTC,"Yes but if you are comparing what they can contribute to the team this coming season, Chadli IMO will produce more, and a fraction of the cost. I think Sterling may be more talented, but ultimately production is what I am concerned with.   And while the homegrown factor is important to a team like City, I could care less if he is English or Martian - that is just a hype thing (same as Americans here freaking out over Yedlin).   And world class potential is a serious stretch, don't buy into that hype. Don't forget while he was good two years ago, he got worse last year. Obviously not having Suarez there matters, but he didn't pick up any of the slack."
coys,3d1kyn,too_oh_ate,25,Mon Jul 13 14:18:55 2015 UTC,I feel like Chadli is very underrated on here at times. He's not the flashiest player or the best player in the team. But he's very good at what he does and fits the team very well. Sure he's not as young as Sterling or look as threatening at times. But he gets in great positions and is able to finish them often which is almost as important.
coys,3d1kyn,tfw13579,5,Sun Jul 12 20:20:42 2015 UTC,He had me tearing my hair out at home to leicester
coys,3d1kyn,caelan03,3,Sun Jul 12 21:34:46 2015 UTC,the big difference between the two is Chadders is a great finisher and person for attacking the defence and making good runs to use good chances created.  Sterling creates a shitload of chances.. but doesn't execute well other peoples when tee'd up.
coys,3d1kyn,tomasnz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:39:43 2015 UTC,"I've got friends who still think Chadli was a waste of money, even after this season. He gets the job done but the problem is he isn't a flashy player, so the neutrals tend not to notice how big an impact he can have for us.  If he was quicker and threw a few more skill moves about there'd be a fair bit of hype around him"
coys,3d1kyn,MrJDMTyte,12,Mon Jul 13 13:23:06 2015 UTC,"In addition to what everyone else is say, Sterling's season before this one was INSANE! Chadli of 2014/2015 wouldn't be able to touch Sterling 2013/2014.    However, £50m is too much. I do think he'll come good soon though.   So could Chadli though. I believe he'll be a 15 goal scorer this season."
coys,3d1kyn,TheHenandtheSheep,6,Sun Jul 12 20:56:36 2015 UTC,This comparison ignores the fact that Sterling's younger and is homegrown.   I love Chadli though.
coys,3d1kyn,tabelz,4,Sun Jul 12 20:43:45 2015 UTC,"Sterling and Chadli are different players so a comparison is not always accurate.   Sterling is more creative, and the stats show that. With Sturridge injured and the rest of Livershite's strikers playing shit, Sterling had no in form striker to feed last season. Now believe me, when he goes to City, with Bony, Aguero, Dzeko and Jovetic waiting, he will be deadly. It will probably take him time to settle in though.   However, £49m is jokes."
coys,3d1kyn,rishichico,5,Sun Jul 12 21:20:50 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think Sterling is the better player, but for the difference in $$ between the two, there's more value in having Chadli, no doubt! Given an option between the 2 players for the same $, I choose Sterling every time."
coys,3d1kyn,impyandchimpy,3,Sun Jul 12 23:10:52 2015 UTC,"If Sterling could actually finish he'd b wearing white and playing in Spain.  City is paying out the nines for the possibility that sterling can eventually learn to put the ball into the net, rather than wide or directly at the keeper.  Seriously, sterling is impressive as hell and is quick.  He gets into great positions with the ball, he just can't yet put the ball away.  If he can start to do that (and he might at City, given the way they play) he will be easily worth much more than 50 million to the likes of RM/Barca."

coys,3d23ug,barnetto2,30,Sun Jul 12 22:19:25 2015 UTC,"You're probably right, but don't forget that we'll be lacking team cohesion as well.  The new look back line will likely not be fully drilled or familiar with each other yet, and quality individuals like Utd have might be able to take advantage of that.  Plus, don't forget that the summer transfer window doesn't end until September, so there'll nearly be a month of transfers still to go when we play them.  It means they might not have their full squad yet, but likely neither will we.  I'm slightly concerned that if we don't sign a CDM and a winger/2nd striker soon, we won't quite be set across the pitch in time to play them.  In any case though, I think we need to factor in a loss at Old Trafford no matter when we play them.  The ability to get into top 4 will not depend on us taking points from OT, it'll depend on our ability to consistently get points at home, and on the road to lesser teams."
coys,3d23ug,Buffaluffasaurus,18,Sun Jul 12 22:46:16 2015 UTC,"Except the only changes to our current starting 11 will likely be Toby, who's played with Jan before, and now has all of pre season to work with the squad, and whoever partners Bentaleb. Otherwise I'd expect the squad to stay the same. Any 2nd strikers or wingers would likely be on the bench, whereas United will have to start most of the signings, they're huge upgrades and they're without Fellaini."

And I definitely hope that we'd have a new CDM by then, which means that literally half of our back 6 players could be newbies.  Not ideal against a talented attacking team."

coys,3d23ug,lilpuck27,5,Mon Jul 13 02:43:02 2015 UTC,I think people are forgetting that when Walker is healthy he's a beast who's arguably the most athletic fullback in the league. And let's not forget we really don't have much pace without him in the lineup.
coys,3d23ug,Buffaluffasaurus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:09:46 2015 UTC,"Walker is probably the incumbent, given that he's completely healthy and in form.  But he hasn't been either of those two things for a while.  I honestly think that it might be down to how Trippier does in pre-season matches.  I'm sure he'll get a good amount of minutes to prove himself."
coys,3d23ug,lambast,3,Mon Jul 13 03:06:25 2015 UTC,They all could be new and our (lack of) defensive cohesion wouldn't suffer.
coys,3d23ug,airz23s_coffee,3,Mon Jul 13 01:10:16 2015 UTC,"In any case though, I think we need to factor in a loss at Old Trafford no matter when we play them.    Pretty much.   I get that people wanna start with enthusiasm and all that, but realistically you've gotta look at this fixture as a near-guaranteed loss, and look ahead to other fixtures.   If we lose, it's expected, anything better than that is a massive bonus."
coys,3d23ug,holamiamor,5,Mon Jul 13 06:02:51 2015 UTC,"I agree that an in form Schweinsteiger, Di Maria, Rooney, Mata, and other players they could be signing this season would be a hard team to beat, probably would easily compete for EPL title. However, as others mentioned, we won't be at our best, in form selves yet either.   However (again), we've been playing well at Old Trafford the past 3 seasons. And i'm hoping Real sign De Gea so we can play against a debutie/Valdes on opening day.  So i'm happy and hoping that we can pick up 3 points the first game and have one less game against against CL-level opponents to worry about."

coys,3d23ug,swiper33,2,Mon Jul 13 06:52:28 2015 UTC,"We also changed our first team a bit though, so it pretty much evens out"
coys,3d23ug,Swish28,7,Sun Jul 12 23:00:03 2015 UTC,"Not really, at least not yet. Capoue, Paulinho, (and possibly Benji) barely made the bench last season, while Wimmer and Trippier were bought for youth/competition. Toby will be the only new starter unless we bring in a good CM/winger within the next month."
coys,3d23ug,swiper33,0,Mon Jul 13 00:29:22 2015 UTC,I expect Trippier to start if he's playing well in the friendlies and Toby should 100% start.   Also I really hope we get a starting midfield partner for Nabil. So that would be potentially 3
coys,3d23ug,Swish28,7,Mon Jul 13 00:58:26 2015 UTC,"I don't see Trippier starting immediately unless he does amazing in preseason. I also hope for a new starting midfielder, but we haven't really been linked with anyone so as of now I'm expecting Mason to start vs United."
coys,3d23ug,UtterNutterButter,4,Mon Jul 13 02:39:12 2015 UTC,Where do you see it changing though? Depending on any major transfers yet to happen I'm fully expecting our lineup to be the same except for Toby and Mason's replacement. That's pretty minor.
coys,3d23ug,papoon,2,Sun Jul 12 23:07:04 2015 UTC,"I expect we will lose on opening day, but there's no shame in that. United are going to be challenging for the title."

coys,3d20hf,Grundle_Troll,9,Sun Jul 12 22:44:17 2015 UTC,"Honestly we were at fault for not pouncing early last season. We could have had him, but we waited too long and Southampton had just sold too many players. Had we made moves slightly earlier he would have been ours.   Another point that has been raised a few times but largely ignored (because who wouldn't want him?), but he and Bentaleb isn't really what we need in our midfield, as sexy as it would be. They both want to be getting forward instead of protecting the back four, which is what we were missing last season. Wanyama however..."
coys,3d20hf,barnetto2,9,Sun Jul 12 23:20:14 2015 UTC,"Morgan didn't want to make a decision on his future until he got back from the World Cup. He gets back, half the team is gone; they refuse to sell him too, not much we could have done   And he is the perfect partner for Bentaleb. We don't need a destroyer. We need someone to play off him who can do the defensive work as well as move forward at time with his quick and incisive passing. Anyway this is all moot now that he will be a United player. Shame, top 4 gap is widening and widening"

Everyone is aware of him after his partnership with Lacazette last season, but I think his teammate will be more in demand for bigger clubs wanting to raid Lyon for an attacker.  It's not the position we need to fill most urgently (CAM), but I think last season showed we badly need a backup for Eriksen.  Plus Fekir is fairly quick and can play backup striker and possibly could be a more creative wide option than Chadli."

coys,3d170f,Antsonfire,10,Sun Jul 12 17:51:33 2015 UTC,"Remember him, being captain, taking a 90th minute freekick off Eriksen, firing it far above target on a golden chance that could have won them the game (or tied it, dont remember). Neither Eriksen or De Boer looked that happy.   That said, he looked strong in the back four, dominant.."

If you watch Ajax regularly, just a question- if Toby looked a better organizer like this article claims and leader of the back four in Amsterdam, why was Vert captain? Was it a seniority thing?"
coys,3d170f,ryffie,2,Sun Jul 12 18:58:45 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call myself an expert on ajax-business, enjoy watching them play though. Yet i suppose it was about seniority indeed, Alderwereld didnt get into the first team until a few seasons after Vertonghen (and about the time Vertonghen was first made captain)..

coys,3d170f,couplingrhino,2,Sun Jul 12 19:48:23 2015 UTC,"Jan doesn't like babysitting or covering for his partner, but during his period as Ajax captain he emerged as a confident and competent leader of the team on and off the pitch. He's done pretty well for us when handed the armband as well. The quote ""Developed this season to end it as the ultimate leader of the pack,"" refers to Vertonghen, not Alderweireld."

Id rather him go to United than a London club.  We just need to keep slowly adding quality, and work on challenging for top 4.  Scum, and City are our targets.  United and Chelsea are a different class than the rest of the league I think.    We are in good shape.  Just need to mesh together."
coys,3d4ejw,alfia,0,Mon Jul 13 13:45:38 2015 UTC,"I agree. That said, I think Morgan would have added that quality. He's not a superstar flashy player, but he's solid and very good at what he does, and they're the kind of players we need, I think - get our fundamentals sorted out in the midfield. I feel like defensively we're fine and it seems like all signs are pointing to Hugo staying for at least another season. We have some great midfielders, IMO we just need a decent Morgan-esque player and a second fiddle for Kane, to either give him someone to play off or at least to act as cover. Ade and Bobby just aren't reliable enough."

Like you said it was a fun read and it was actually more interesting to hear about the players in our own squad than the schnielderlin talk. I don't get why people hate on an itk rumor when they have the same level of truth as a mirror article. If someone posted my itk thread in the form of a mirror article it would've been way better received.   And itk threads are taken with salt. Why do you get upset when an unreliable rumor is untrue? You don't get offended when a mirror article is untrue. There is basically a built in disclaimer with an itk post. They are just more entertaining than a daily sport article about us fighting the scum to sign lacazette for 30m + andros + kebabs

He loves a good tackle, he's got good passing vision (for his age), he's good in the air, he moves like a giraffe, and he's got some goals in him.  He played CDM earlier in the season, but lately we've moved him further forward and it's paid some dividends.

coys,3d4pt1,COYS4,14,Mon Jul 13 14:38:23 2015 UTC,"Some of us Brits quite like the NFL, many don't have a clue about it.   But all of us like the idea of a few million quid extra per season to cover the compensation costs of the latest sacked manager and his backroom team, and free up funds for overpaid third-choice strikers."
coys,3d4pt1,kaleidoscopic82,3,Mon Jul 13 14:44:21 2015 UTC,"That's how I see it too. I mean, all those exit negotiations and buyouts must get expensive, and if we have a new way to finance them which doesn't impact the traditional buying of 4-5 new players to ""fit the system"" every year (who are then sold 2-3 years later), then that's just a win-win."

""We'll be back shortly for the Verizon kick off after the Nationwide coin flip."" It's a bit ridiculous at times.  Regarding the ""money grabbing NFL"", I don't think that's gonna affect us what so ever. They're just paying us money to use our stadium. I don't see any downside for us (granted, I don't know everything)."
coys,3d4pt1,erlenddl,2,Mon Jul 13 15:12:23 2015 UTC,Why is the NFL hated so much over there?
coys,3d4pt1,arcisal,2,Mon Jul 13 15:18:19 2015 UTC,"I think lots of times in the U.S. Football and American football fan sets are mutually exclusive for some reason. The football/soccer fans get self righteous and snotty about futbol and combined with the diving reputation of football/soccer you can understand how American football fans could see soccer/football fans as sort of elitist or cunts (also with the European ""sophisticated"" sort of air, which is ironic because in Britain it has always been a working man's game). In response to hostility from American football fans soccer/football fans sometimes dislike American football in response. Probably not a majority- my friends and I like both varieties of football but prefer European. Some American redditors though hate American football with a passion."
coys,3d4pt1,bzva74,2,Mon Jul 13 15:59:44 2015 UTC,"I used to be an American Football fanatic, my family has season tickets for Miami Hurricanes games even though they live in Houston, Texas. But the recent trend towards the ""pussification of football"" has really turned me off. The games now are essentially all about offense, and fantasy football, big hits are frowned upon, and fines are disproportionately levied on defensive players. I'm slowly becoming a casual football fan, and watching more soccer."
coys,3d4pt1,hteezy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:28:18 2015 UTC,"Probably because alot of people see it as a pussy version of rugby. Personally i dont like watching NFL because its not very free flowing, alot of stop start and a million and one adverts. I think most people pick up sports in schools, and as far as i know its not played in schools in the UK. This means most people dont understand the rules and really cant be bothered to find out about them."

coys,3d4pt1,erlenddl,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:58:00 2015 UTC,"OK.  It seems for someone that reads what you write that you think otherwise, since you claim explicitly that the physical geography of the internet is irrelevant.

I guess I thought your first comment was a little bit ""this is an American site, bitches. And if you don't like it, you can get out."" I was probably just projecting that, but either way it doesn't really matter. So I decided ""naah, nobody cares. I'll back down."""

coys,3d0mi5,SubbyDoo,47,Sun Jul 12 14:46:20 2015 UTC,Kyle Walker and let Trippier earn his spot.

coys,3d0mi5,hteezy,4,Sun Jul 12 17:56:45 2015 UTC,If performances are similar to last year Tripp will be first choice.
coys,3d0mi5,Blubbey,23,Sun Jul 12 16:37:42 2015 UTC,"Never been a big stats guy when it comes to football. Seeing that statistically, Yedlin is the most defensively capable RB we have, has reinforced my mistrust of them."
coys,3d0mi5,nrolo24,12,Sun Jul 12 14:53:37 2015 UTC,The article basically said that Yedlin performed better in the MLS than Walker did in the Premier League. Why is that so unbelievable?
coys,3d0mi5,dabarnz,18,Sun Jul 12 16:14:34 2015 UTC,"Not that it is unbelievable, just that it doesn't mean anything."
coys,3d0mi5,tbiz_werkin,-5,Sun Jul 12 16:31:20 2015 UTC,"I don't think that it is meaningless. The numbers suggest that in his league, against lower competition Yedlin is prone to fewer defensive errors and more likely to contribute on offence. The defensive discipline and willingness to create chances for others could translate to the Premier League, even though in all likeliness Yedlin is still the inferior player."
coys,3d0mi5,dabarnz,5,Sun Jul 12 16:54:49 2015 UTC,"But how is a ""defensive error"" counted anyway? A good full-back will intercept the play before he even gets a chance to either win a ""tackle"" or lose to a ""defensive error"".  Peter Shilton makes an astute comment about this in his auto-biography. He argues that a great goalie does not make many saves/interceptions because he organizes his defense in such a way that he doesn't have to make saves. A merely good goalie, on the other hand, makes lots of saves and interceptions because he is unable to organize his defense. As a result, statistically speaking, the great goalie might look weaker due to a low ratio of saved goals. The low ratio is on account of allowing fewer shots, and the shots he does allow tend to be much more of a clear-cut chance.   What /u/nrolo24 (and Peter Shilton) is pointing out, then, is lots of interventions are far more important than the type of stats that can be counted.  EDIT: Missing words"
coys,3d0mi5,p_gascoigne,3,Sun Jul 12 18:00:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this. You give me much more credit for my original statement with the weatlh of knowledge you just let loose. But in short exactly what I was thinking. Stats do not make the player. To the original reply, I don't think Yedlin has performed at any level better than Walker defensively. But he may some day when he learns positioning. Right now his athleticism lets him make mistakes. Probably boosting stats as stated above"
coys,3d0mi5,nrolo24,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:18:05 2015 UTC,Of course it could. Yedlin could be an amazing player for us. But doing well in an inferior league doesn't necessarily translate into success in the Premier League. These stars are basically pointless.
coys,3d0mi5,erlenddl,4,Sun Jul 12 17:18:34 2015 UTC,"I mean, I average about 15 interceptions and 10 chances created per 90 minutes playing in defense when me and my friends play football. Doesn't mean that I would be able to do it in the premier league."
coys,3d0mi5,erlenddl,6,Sun Jul 12 16:51:04 2015 UTC,"Depends how fit Walker is. If he's not 100%, then Trippier. If not, then (barring an incredibly good preseason for Trippier, or a poor preseason for Walker) Walker should remain first choice until Trippier proves he is better.   In all honesty, I think Trippier is the better all round player. But hopefully he will get the best out of Kyle."
coys,3d0mi5,theninjanipples,4,Sun Jul 12 15:26:16 2015 UTC,I think Trip will get his chance to earn the spot. I don't trust Walker's fitness much at all right now.
coys,3d0mi5,smokey815,3,Sun Jul 12 16:11:28 2015 UTC,"As long as the competition is there it doesn't matter who gets the eventual nod. Rose had genuine competition for the first time in a long time last season, and we all know how that worked out. The guy went from ""needs replacing"" to ""Invaluable"" in the space of a season.  The best part is, Davies wasn't exactly ""left in the dust"" by Rose either. He came in towards the end of the season when Rose was injured and was a more than capable replacement for one of the standout performers on our team."

coys,3d0mi5,GMC1377,0,Sun Jul 12 18:07:34 2015 UTC,"it'll definitely be between Walker and Trippier, but I'd actually like to see yedlin get a run. He can match the raw pace of Walker and idk how we can say he's inferior without giving him a try. His acceleration off the dribble to provide crosses at the endline has worked wonders for team USA- be it from right wing or right back. Trippier looks to be quality though too so... shit"
coys,3d0mi5,jaysee5,-3,Mon Jul 13 05:09:15 2015 UTC,Trippier. Walker's pace tends to cover his horrid positioning and general poor defensive skills.
coys,3d3zpv,theoracle101,13,Mon Jul 13 09:54:11 2015 UTC,"I am going to try an angle here. Let's do a ""where are they now?"" with Europa League qualifiers (qualified by league position) since we made champions league (5 seasons).    10/11: City, AstonV, Pool (the year we got UCL) 11/12: Newcastle, Spurs 12/13: Spurs 13/14: Everton, Spurs 14/15: Liverpool, Southhampton, Spurs    OK so Everton and AV were nowhere last season. Pool are in and out, Suarez got them to UCL once (not to mention, we beat them last season). Newcastle got relegated and were terrible last season. City = Money, they were just building at that point.    So where are spurs? We are there every time regardless of managerial turmoil, losing our best players, poor signings, injuries....plenty of excuses    The top 4 have WAY more money than us. So I am optimistic because we perform at a consistently high level in a very difficult league. So yes, I am resigned to our fate of being awesome and competitive every season. We didn't bottle our chance, we came 4th and missed out on UCL because Cuntski won it that year. Then we missed 4th by 1 point the year after. I think we got very unlucky. What do we do now? New stadium, youth core, great signings, sustainable management. I really can't feel pessimistic right now in the context. Could be a lot worse! Look at the other teams I just mentioned in their short term. Let's lock in 5th year in year out, sign cool players, back the manager, until it happens for us. COYS    ninja edit: I have no reason to think Southhampton are entering this season stronger than us. Liverpool, well both we and they have another key signing or two to settle that."

coys,3d3zpv,Roshambo2110,8,Mon Jul 13 10:06:53 2015 UTC,"Why does it have to happen soon? Every team tries to improve during the window, it's unrealistic to expect us to make top 4 after every transfer window. You are seriously underestimating just how big the teams above us are when it comes to making and sealing transfers. We can't compete with them either financially or in pulling power. We need to be smarter and invest in the future.  Not to mention that we're about to have a stadium to pay for. We need to be frugal, which Levy is very good at being, whilst still doing essential business."
coys,3d3zpv,SAeN,5,Mon Jul 13 11:13:42 2015 UTC,"I'd like us to solidify our position as the '5th' club - IMO, finishing on the top 4 is reliant on us over-achieving, and one of Arsenal, Chelsea, Mans Utd or City having a poor season.  If we can do this without spunking fortunes on players like the ones we're currently shipping out of the club, and instead be able to utilise the younger players coming through - as long as they're as good as they're cracked up to be - it would put us in really good stead. We're not going to be able to compete financially with the existing 4 but we can outmatch clubs like Liverpool on the pitch if not on."
coys,3d3zpv,Roshambo2110,6,Mon Jul 13 11:24:54 2015 UTC,"I'd like us to solidify our position as the '5th' club   We've been that team since the 09/10 season.   09/10 4th  10/11 5th  11/12 4th  12/13 5th  13/14 6th  14/15 5th  I agree with OPs sentiment that we should always be looking to cement ourselves in the Top 4, but it's a huge gap to bridge right now. Not saying we aren't capable of it, but Spurs fans need to temper their expectations a little more. We can get there, but it's a 'within the next 5 seasons' project', not 'next season'."
coys,3d3zpv,Blubbey,2,Mon Jul 13 11:34:32 2015 UTC,"You say that, and I don't disagree, but there's significant competition for that 5th place.  Liverpool, for one, have spent a fortune on some good players and will spend more after getting far more, IMO, than Sterling is worth."
coys,3d3zpv,rathey123,5,Mon Jul 13 11:40:40 2015 UTC,"It seems we have bottled a golden opportunity    Bottled how? It's not like the other teams are significantly worse the club's done fuck all. Yeah it could've been better no question but you're acting like other clubs have stood still.   Trying to find a reason to be optimistic    03/04 the club finished 14th and now is a regular top 6 club. This is a hell of a lot better than it used to be. CL is possible I suppose but unlikely, the fact is the club have a lot less money. In fact the club are overachieving in those terms."
coys,3d3zpv,Keratome,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:58:10 2015 UTC,"Money is not everything people... In the 13/14 season 68% of the Barcelona team were products of their youth academy. Think messi, xavi, iniesta, puyol, pique, busquets, barca paid fuck all in terms of transfer fees for these players. I think having good youth (like we seem to have atm) is the way we can break through and become a top 4 club. Look at what Athletico Madrid achieved a couple of seasons back as well, won the title and champions league finalists. Top 4 is obviously something we shouldn't expect but we shouldn't write off the possibility just because we spend less money."
coys,3d3zpv,rathey123,3,Mon Jul 13 11:49:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, it may not be all about money is true to a point, but that's Barcelona's academy, which attracts a very high level of worldwide youth talent that stay on to make the first eleven because its barcelona, where else can they go that is not a step down, it would have to be another elite club, so it is not a fair comparison."
coys,3d3zpv,98190,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:30:10 2015 UTC,"Barcelona had most them players at the ages of about 11-13 so they pretty much turned them into who they are. If you have 5-6 players who have come through the youth team together from a young age by the time they are 20 and in the first team they have already been playing together for 8 or so years. No amount of money can buy that team chemistry and experience with each other. We supposedly have some of the best youth facilities in Europe so maybe sometime within the next 10 years we can hope something like this will happen, and i believe in ways it already is."
coys,3d3zpv,rathey123,2,Mon Jul 13 14:56:30 2015 UTC,"Money does matter.  What is total transfer fees and wages for Neymar, Suarez, Rakatic? That's just in the last two seasons."

coys,3cz5x3,zlintner1,13,Sun Jul 12 05:19:09 2015 UTC,The 100 million doesn't go to him
coys,3cz5x3,coocookuhchoo,3,Sun Jul 12 11:52:41 2015 UTC,Yes but at the risk of being downvoted it makes sense that in a universe where United convinced him to trade sunny Spain for the Manchester project they would no doubt give him a fat pay bump
coys,3cz5x3,yungliteskin,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:56:16 2015 UTC,"exactly this. Obviously the transfer fee doesn't go to him that's retarded to think otherwise but if they were to sign him they'd have to match or most likely beat his 300,000pw wages at Real.

coys,3cz5x3,Blubbey,4,Sun Jul 12 16:29:26 2015 UTC,FFP is to prevent clubs spending money they aren't bringing in smaller clubs from investing enough money to seriously challenge the billionaire clubs beloved of UEFA and American glory hunters r/soccer that are ruining football.

coys,3cz5x3,lurklikeaboss,0,Sun Jul 12 17:10:07 2015 UTC,"What's another example of it happening? Like seriously, try to think of one. The closest would be Podolski and Koln, but if he hadn't been a failure or had lived up to his potential throughout his career I'm not sure if even he would've gone back. Kuyt went back to Feyenoord sure, but he's not so much as lost a step as he's tired and probably on his last legs.   It won't be 31-32 if that's what you're suggesting. At best we get him back at like 34 or 35."
coys,3cz5x3,Antsonfire,3,Sun Jul 12 17:18:14 2015 UTC,"It's just my opinion. I don't care what has or hasn't happened with other players, he's said in the past he'd like to come back at some point, and I believe he'd rather do it when he still has the legs to compete in the PL."

coys,3cz5x3,TorontoHooligan,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:41:14 2015 UTC,"While I agree that a lot of talk happens about past players (Especially Bale) which I think shouldn't, why do you have to call every player that leaves a ""cunt""?

But we shouldn't expect him to be a senior squad member that soon.   Bentaleb was thrown into the deep-end by Sherwood. He was either going to sink or swim, luckily for us he's done very well. That's not the best approach to take for every youth player who shows promise."
coys,3cwgcs,NatrolleonBonaparte,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:22:21 2015 UTC,Not sure about that. Ave doesn't necessarily mean anything. Quality players are already quality when they were young. Think about players like Rooney and Messi. Though of course I'd say Azzaoui probably isn't that level yet.

coys,3cwxz7,Your_Personal_Jesus,19,Sat Jul 11 14:28:22 2015 UTC,"To be perfectly honest, although I wouldn't be particularly happy, I won't be surprised at all if we don't end up buying a CM and just stick to what we have right now. We all know Poch's tendency to utilize youth players and I can see that exactly happening with our CMs.  Bentaleb is a no brainer. He's the heart and soul of the center of our midfield and should start as many games as possible.  I feel people are dismissing Mason too early already. For someone who was on loan at League One, to make the leap into PL football and fit in almost seamlessly is pretty amazing. He's not that young at 24 but it doesn't mean he won't improve. Not to say the criticism against him wasn't warranted, but to say that we shouldn't use him and leave him out of our ""Bentaleb's midfield partner"" discussions is a bit silly and rash. He may turn out to not improve by that much, but at worse he'll still remain as a useful/reliable squad player. And considering how patient he's been this whole time, we should at least keep him longer despite his relatively lackluster second half.  If there was one player I think would be sold, it would be Dembele, and logically it would make sense. At 27 he could still fetch a relatively decent price and he deserves to be in a team which can utilize his very specific skillsets to its full potential. His talents are wasted here. He's great at holding up the ball, but his first instinct is to dribble, instead of look up and pass. He does decently when he's on, but any other of our CMs could probably perform just as well in his position, not that he's that bad but rather he doesn't fit well into the type of midfielder Poch wants.  Haven't seen too many Swansea games to evaluate but there are pretty good things to be heard from their fans about Carroll. I think it'll come down to the pre-season evaluation/training and the first half of the season. If he isn't a good fit/can't adapt, then he can be sold off in January or the following transfer window. Regardless, I'd like to see him be given a shot at the first team before we jump to conclusions.  The interesting player to talk about is Alli. I admit that I did not see a single MK Dons match last season, but to be League One YPOTY is pretty impressive. He's obviously a very attack-minded CM, scoring 16 goals and grabbing 9 assists. Apparently he's a very well-rounded CM, and at such a young age it can be only a good thing because it leaves plenty of time and development for Poch is use him as he thinks best. If it were any other young player, a loan to a Championship side or Lower PL team would be the most logical, but in light of the recent comments by Alli himself and how he performed last season, even that sentiment is up for debate.  Whatever the course of action is, I think I'll leave it to our head coach to work with transfers and midfielders because, at the end of the day, what the fuck do I know."
coys,3cwxz7,arcisal,10,Sat Jul 11 15:09:59 2015 UTC,"Good post but I think you are wrong. I don't think for a second that Carroll will remain in the squad, he never established himself nor impressed at Swansea. The rest you mentioned will remain. Dembélé is usefull and if he is happy to stay I think he will. I think we'll sign one CM, one striker and maybe a winger before the window is over and sell Carroll, Kaboul, Chiriches, Stambouli, Soldado (maybe if he wants to go) and hopefully Adebayor."
coys,3cwxz7,superradwalkman,3,Sat Jul 11 17:10:43 2015 UTC,"Agree with you on Mason. Always worries me on this sub how many people have adopted a very kneejerk 'no he's bad replace him' attitude - his first season was, by his standards (I've followed him a while), brilliant. If he improves then it's great for us because he's a passionate, local lad (Enfield represent) and if not we have a great amount of options. More than deserves his chance to stake his claim. Would hate for us to be that club who'd rather chew him out for a mercenary without fair chance."
coys,3cwxz7,mummysgrowler,2,Sat Jul 11 19:52:26 2015 UTC,"It's great to see some support for Mason on here! To me Mason seems to be a great team player, he doesn't necessarily steal the spotlight with lots of goals and assists but he's a solid distributer and non selfish player. Also, if it had been Lamela who provided that chip assist for Rose's goal in our final home game last season this sub would have gone crazy! http://streamable.com/pdme"
coys,3cwxz7,nzcoys,9,Sun Jul 12 01:45:13 2015 UTC,That would be scary because we would have no true DM in the squad.
coys,3cwxz7,CareOfCell44,8,Sat Jul 11 14:42:20 2015 UTC,Veljkovic could although we will see if he is up to standard.
coys,3cwxz7,Ru8,2,Sat Jul 11 15:56:16 2015 UTC,"Poch hardly ever fielded one after Capoue fell out of favour last season, though. Don't know if that was because he didn't find Stambouli up to the task, or because he doesn't think it's necessary, but with all the defensive reinforcements we're seen this window, it's not set in stone that we even need one. Our best games last year had no true DM in the mix."
coys,3cwxz7,apathosaurus,2,Sat Jul 11 16:57:02 2015 UTC,also the reason why our defense was so shit all season long
coys,3cwxz7,dec14,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:13:17 2015 UTC,"I think its a matter of choice really. We don't play with a DM and we will let in more goals but the hope is two more attack minded CM's will allow us to at-least punt in a few up the other end. Not always going to work in practice but I remember many games where we utilised DMs and got pumped by 3 goals or more.   I'm more a fan of not playing a true DM, as a player in that role more often than not doesn't have the same ability going forward as CM players of comparable value."
coys,3cwxz7,BuzzsawBrennan,5,Sun Jul 12 19:11:20 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see us go in for Jordy Clasie. Rumoured to be Southampton's replacement for Schneiderlin, and of course there's the Dutch connection with Koeman, but I think he would fit in nicely alongside Bentaleb."

Just having a look at last year, Naughton, Veljkovic, Fryers, Carroll, Holtby, Ceballos and Falque were all used, the two post-season friendlies had Winks, Onomah, Ward and KWP too for example. Assess what's needed and go from there, no point buying if you have the players there already.   Would anyone actually be comfortable with starting the season with just Bentaleb/Carroll/Mason/Dembele/Alli? Any chance that happens?    Unconvinced of Carroll, Mason's first proper season and I'm always willing to give players a second season, so another signing would probably be best if the manager thinks the youth players can't step up. Who though, I can't say. Can't have four though, one injury and you're fucked."
coys,3cwxz7,Blubbey,2,Sat Jul 11 15:10:33 2015 UTC,"While pre-season is good to evaluate young players, it's also important to get the new players integrated and everybody to a certain level of understanding with each other as well. And while we did play alot of the youngsters last year, it was a World Cup year where alot of our players went and therefore needed to take the pre-season to rest. This being a non-World Cup/Non-Euro year means that most of our players haven't played all summer, totally different scenario."

coys,3cwxz7,nssmuckers,8,Sat Jul 11 15:03:02 2015 UTC,Cabaye would be sucking wind after 25 minutes in our system. He's honestly perfect for the direct counter attacking of Palace.  He's a good player but I think we need someone more defensive with a lot of energy.

The question for me is how they physically swap out the two pitches, with one apparently kept in the basement below the playing level.   I'm completely guessing, but I would guess there's one grass pitch used by Spurs and one artificial pitch used by the NFL. The artificial pitch stays in the basement (because it doesn't need access to sunlight), and the grass field stays at playing level 99% of the time. Both fields will have to be sectionable - the grass growing in rectangular boxes, which are then shoved against each other to form a full-sized pitch - so that they can be swapped out vertically."

Except underneath will be an artificial turf surface for NFL games and also events (since turf is more rugged, you can do concerts and whatnot on it with minimal issue).  So, it's definitely not the first retractable field, but it is the first that has a second field under it haha. Levy and others explained all this in their interviews, but it seems this nuance has confused many in the media and thus the fans as well."

He'll also go missing for 3-4 games in a row. Highlight reel player.  Not the type of player that will help us push for top 4 at all, very negative lazy signing."
coys,3cziec,i-spye,3,Sun Jul 12 08:43:55 2015 UTC,"Our wingers are in a strange spot. Townsend has all the physical potential in the world and with a few tweaks and coaching could be unreal, but he is just still so ineffective. Chadli has come off a great year but despite a great goal haul, even in games he scored he was inconsistent. Lamela seems to have finally found his feet and Pochettino is a big fan of his, but still potential doesn't mean a lot when you need to win football games right now.  I thought Mirallas would have been a really good signing in January in a swap for Lennon and I still think it would be now. We need at least one more wide man this window but I don't know if it's going to be a player who the club feels will be a sure starter or another squad option. I think he would fit in nicely but I wouldn't be upset if we missed out on him. Don't get me wrong, I'd be happy if he came but wouldn't be devastated if he went elsewhere. He is two footed, can play in all 3 spots behind the striker, has good set piece and has delivery, pace and trickery."
coys,3cziec,Spurs94,4,Sun Jul 12 08:02:30 2015 UTC,"IMO, he is very, very good indeed. Direct, powerful and a goal threat.  Some bits he could improve on but hopefully Poch could bring that out of him.  If the Lennon + £3.5m rumours are true, I'd be all over it."

So, to be blunt, no way he comes to Spurs."

If they want him and are willing to pay the 20mill(which i dont think he's worth btw) then he'll be their man.  If no other CL team comes in for him it'll be interesting to see what he'll do. Will he lower his standards of club? Or will put his head down and work?   I cant see him coming here for both i cant see us paying the money they want for him or southampton wanting to do business with us

Looking at the section, the pitch only retracts under the podium for protection purposes when NFL is being played. It doesn't move to outside the stadium like a lot of other moveable pitches.  You can see the zone that has been left free for the pitch to move into.  Moving pitches are normally made to retract towards the goals as this is the shortest width, therefore it is easiest to cantilever the whole stand to allow it to pass underneath. It is almost impossible to take pitches out sideways for this reason."

In England:  1 - keeper  2 - right back  3 - left back  4- defensive mid  5 - centre back  6 - centre back  7 - right wing  8 - attacking mid  9 - striker/target man  10- striker/playmaker

coys,3csmid,brokenairguitar,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:50:42 2015 UTC,You are correct. I remember thinking when he took 11 that he had some big shoes to fill. Hopefully this season he can build on the end of last season.
coys,3csmid,mappsy91,4,Fri Jul 10 19:56:35 2015 UTC,You can change your number for league games but not for European competition. Lamela had to wear 33 the whole year in Europa League. Chiriches also had to wear 12 because Scott Parker was initially changed to 6 from 8 when Paulinho came in before he was sold himself.

coys,3csj5n,fatguylilcoat_,13,Fri Jul 10 19:09:29 2015 UTC,"I know the NFL is trying to make this push into England. It seems so awkward. I don't think it's going to latch on over there the way they would hope. Sure, they can sell out their 1 or 2 games a year on novelty value/americans abroad, like when Liverpool comes to Fenway Park, but establishing a franchise there is an entirely different story. I think there's a lot of good reasons the NFL Europe didn't take anywhere except Germany. I think to the casual British fan the NFL probably comes off as slow paced rugby with pads. I also think it's going to lead to some logistical problems with the travel time and time difference. San Francisco to London is a hell of a trip. Monday/Thursday night football is going to be impractical. I think expanding into Canada or Mexico would make a lot more sense if you're looking to expand American Football internationally."
coys,3csj5n,MeddlingMike,2,Fri Jul 10 13:19:29 2015 UTC,"London has enough people to support a team, the question is only about logistics, and the NFL is willing to overlook the issues it may cause in order to get a team in an european city. Not saying its a good idea, but there are ways of dealing with the distance, Bye weeks, playing mainly eastern US teams, long blocks of home and away games. The problem will eventually be about whether players are willing to overlook the distance to live in london, and i think thats a toss up. Where would you rather be, London or tampa bay? They need a good ownership group to take over, because if Marc Davis took over the stadium would be empty by week 2."

coys,3cul7r,TheDrunkyMonkey,7,Fri Jul 10 23:07:53 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying but saints didn't sell us anything, Toby was never theirs and always wanted to come here once he knew we were interested. So it wouldn't exactly be ""again""."
coys,3cul7r,WillSpur,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:33:59 2015 UTC,"Of course they didn't and i completely agree with you, but you're ignoring how the southampton fans reacted. Try going onto a southampton fan forum and see what the mood is like towards spurs. It would be management suicide if they were to sell their star player to us. By ""again"" you have to look at the past. Quite a lot of the distain comes from us taking hoddle from them. Then bale and helping him achieve his potential. Then we took poch and some of their other staff(eg. Mitchell). Stealing toby from under their noses followed by taking their best player would be the final straw.  On a similar note, i always find it amusing that le tissier(their god) is a spurs fan and was very close to leaving them for us. Oh how much they would hate us if he did."
coys,3cul7r,TheDrunkyMonkey,2,Sat Jul 11 16:28:31 2015 UTC,"True, fair point. We have taken a lot of good from them recently, Poch and Mitchell were completely out of my mind."
coys,3cul7r,WillSpur,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:48:12 2015 UTC,"Hoddle   I think you are putting too much into this. Not a whole lot of S'oton fans care about Dean Richards and Glenn Hoddle moving to Spurs (as both proved to be immense duds). And, no S'oton fan should be surprised that Hoddle wanted to take a stab at the Spurs job anyway, it would be absurd if he didn't take the chance.  Gareth Bale, just like Walcott and OX, was obviously going to leave a Championship club anyway. It is not like we should hate Real Madrid for buying Modric...it is just football.  Poch was probably annoying for them, but again, they got the legend that is Koeman in his place. Hardly a down-grade."
coys,3cul7r,p_gascoigne,2,Sat Jul 11 16:49:45 2015 UTC,"I really dont think i am. If you read around, there is quite a bit of hatred from southampton fans. I've been talking to many spurs fans about the toby deal and they all seem to have the same opinion that there has been some bad blood from the fans ever since hoddle.  You are missing the important point that just because we dont feel like fans are justified in complaining, doesn't mean they won't do so. For example look at the reactions of our fans towards real madrid due bale/modric or even the hatred of chelsea due to the willian transfer, which are all moves that a neutral would not blame the players for wanting. But many spurs fans were outraged by it.  The manager swap is the same. They may feel like they've turned out well for it but it doesn't escape the fact that several of their beloved staff felt that a rival(as they see it) would be stronger than them. The hurt and hatred will still be there. And they may know, it won't necessarily fall so luckily when koeman goes."
coys,3cul7r,TheDrunkyMonkey,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:02:34 2015 UTC,"Do any Spurs fans really hate Real Madrid?  Where any fans really outraged that the biggest club on the planet bought Modric? Where we also not pretty satisfied they paid the biggest transfer fee in history for a top-10 player at best?  And we don't like Man. Utd. much, but it doesn't really have much to do with the Carrick/Berbatov deals.  Chelsea-Spurs have obvious reasons for hostility, Willian is a pretty insignificant part of that.  And, when, really, was the last time you heard about somebody being mad about Hoddle taking Dean Richards with him up to London from the south coast?"

coys,3crp3w,tomasnz,2,Fri Jul 10 09:17:09 2015 UTC,I think Everton were actually top this year where as we were second.

coys,3crp3w,sunthunder,-5,Fri Jul 10 06:12:12 2015 UTC,I'd like to point out that this was most definitely not Hugo's fault.
coys,3crp3w,mpw90,29,Fri Jul 10 10:09:04 2015 UTC,Can I say 'the fans'  sure they're not technically 'on the field' but Adebayor (for all his faults) was not wrong when he said fear off the crowd holds the team back.
coys,3crp3w,darkwing_duck_III,12,Fri Jul 10 06:14:31 2015 UTC,"I agree completely, move away from the south east corner of the Lane and it starts to resemble the library. It's a real shame, I remember Spurs being shit in the 90s and the crowd behind them for the full 90 minutes.  That being said, the away fans have been amazing."
coys,3crp3w,bullion,3,Fri Jul 10 09:07:33 2015 UTC,Spot on.
coys,3crp3w,WindyCOYS,7,Fri Jul 10 20:55:41 2015 UTC,"the fans weren't the problem. the performances we were putting up at the time were nothing short of atrocious...for any team, let alone one aiming for top 4.  spurs fans are a reasonable bunch for the most part. if our players try, if they play like it means something to wear the shirt, we can't fault them for losing.  that could not have been further from the case when adebayor made those comments. I don't think we'll have any players left in the squad who aren't willing to bleed for the club after this window, so I don't see it being a problem in the future."
coys,3crp3w,aigletunisien,12,Fri Jul 10 06:20:18 2015 UTC,"People use this argument all of the time but it's wrong.  When Danny Rose was hated by fans he was usually giving 100% effort, but that didn't stave off the abuse thrown his way. Why do people assume fans are qualified to assess who gives a shit and who doesn't?"
coys,3crp3w,NotConor419,2,Fri Jul 10 08:33:51 2015 UTC,"This is true, I will truly never understand why Danny rose gets so much shit for making mistakes when assou-ekotto never got the same abuse, for thinking he was a better player than he was in a lot of cases, taking on a player in his own half etc. it seems to me that some players are exempt from criticism and done attract it unfairly. (Although to be fair I can see where some of the abuse rose attracts comes from, I feel his improvement this year should have silenced at least some of the doubters. Still a young player"

coys,3crp3w,smokey815,-1,Fri Jul 10 14:03:04 2015 UTC,"You're missing the point.  The majority of fans were abusive towards players like Rose & Chadli at the beginning of the last season and the end of the one prior, this had a negative effect on players on the pitch and Adebayor was absolutely right that our fans were at fault.  If fans just got behind the entire team, we wouldn't have this problem."
coys,3crp3w,NotConor419,2,Fri Jul 10 14:07:38 2015 UTC,I'm not missing the point. I'm making a different one.

coys,3crp3w,airz23s_coffee,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:08:54 2015 UTC,"I totally agree, the lane has seemed to have quietened down over the past few years. It could just be a coincidence but I noticed a major difference in crowd behaviour after the 'banning' of the word yid. That was always the chant outside before the match and inside which had the drum going, it riled people up. I think by restricting our expression it made us all a little self-contained and self-conscious about what we say and how we act.   YID ARMY!!"
coys,3crp3w,hsapsted,6,Fri Jul 10 08:03:58 2015 UTC,I want to see us tighten up. If we could concede less than 40-odd goals that'd be nice.
coys,3crp3w,airz23s_coffee,10,Fri Jul 10 07:09:25 2015 UTC,"Better tactical adaptability.  There were some games, namely WBA and Newcastle at home and Man City away, where Poch's stubborn tactical approach really cost us. It's not just about formations or subs, though I feel that he should start doing some earlier, but rather he approaches almost every game similarly.   I'd personally would like to see him play a pure DM to give more room for the other CM to move ahead and make something happen. And also use traditional wingers, using pace to beat the fullback and cross from the byline. Just play wider in general to stretch the opponent defense across the pitch.  Besides that, it would help immeasurably if we improved on our offensive set pieces. Other than Eriksen's freekicks, we are just about as dangerous as wet spaghetti when it comes to corners and indirect freekicks."
coys,3crp3w,arcisal,4,Fri Jul 10 09:21:17 2015 UTC,"Quit playing to the level of competition we are up against.   We play like heroes against the top teams (even if we lose), and then embarrass ourselves against weaker sides.  The inconsistency is pretty poor. Beating Chelsea and then losing to Palace the next week comes to mind, but this is a systematic problem for years now."
coys,3crp3w,too_oh_ate,2,Fri Jul 10 14:05:36 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. I loved the second West Brom game this year as we actually played to our potential in a relatively easy match. In the 4-3 against Leicester I was so pissed off, I knew it was awesome but I was still a bit fed up."
coys,3crp3w,TheodoreP,2,Fri Jul 10 18:20:07 2015 UTC,"Better protection of the back four.   I seriously believe that if we get a better balanced midfield, we could see huge improvement in results - against the lesser teams as well as the top teams."
coys,3crp3w,Laviston,2,Fri Jul 10 07:34:46 2015 UTC,"I just want too see exciting football. I wanna c usually come out and blitz teams from the start like we used to under Harry in and around the time we qualified for champs league, instead of the lethargic first 20 mins we seem to have been putting in in the league this last couple of years. I feel we have lost some of that spark in the last couple of years."
coys,3crp3w,argentina-turner,2,Fri Jul 10 11:38:03 2015 UTC,Less simple defensive errors.

coys,3crp3w,flancresty,2,Fri Jul 10 16:51:45 2015 UTC,"Just because we can now endure the long games and win them at the last minute, doesn't mean we have to.   It's a good thing to have in the back pocket, but wrapping up a game quicker is more ideal, and will mean less recovery if done correctly.  Still, the bloody excitement when Eriksen slots it over the wall in injury time."
coys,3crp3w,mpw90,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:11:24 2015 UTC,A tighter defence. Not leaking annoying and daft goals due to either a confusion between players or lack of concentration.   Ninja edit: By no means am I advocating a Chelsea like defence that is the basis for boring play by winning 1-0. Just more sensible defending!

I don't really know what to choose. I've never been to Europe even though I've really wanted to travel. My family may go to London for vacation before the trip so I don't think I'd do the England one. Otherwise I have no idea what to choose. Any recommendations?
coys,3cs1ze,tfw13579,3,Fri Jul 10 16:55:15 2015 UTC,"I'd go with London. I know Natrolleon did his fair of traveling when he was over there, so I don't think you'd have a problem. Also, catch some matches at the lane."

coys,3cs1ze,Coys11,2,Fri Jul 10 16:30:42 2015 UTC,"London is an incredible city, but being an American who has traveled there several times in my life, these days it doesn't feel all that 'British,' as it used to. Could just be that I was younger when I was going in the 90's and early 2000's and it felt newer, but when I was there last summer it didn't have the same feeling. But it sounds like you'd visit a couple places in England so that would be cool to get a larger sense of what the country has to offer.   I absolutely loved France, although I haven't been to the Netherlands or Belgium, but I think that'd be a cool experience to have a couple places to visit and learn about. That said, a unique thing about a term abroad is that you can stay in one area and really get to know it, which you don't really while on vacation."
coys,3cs1ze,tfw13579,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:48:35 2015 UTC,The thing about this winter term is that its only a few weeks and more of like a vacation.

London is nice and seeing Spurs would be cool but its fucking expensive and all the culture is getting pushed out by money. Berlin is my favorite city in Europe (also been to London, Amsterdam, and Paris) - tons of nightlife, amazing parks, awesome people, tons of people speak English, super laidback lifestyle (no open container laws, no leash laws, etc.), exciting youth culture, and tons of history (although you can find that in any European city obvs)"
coys,3cs1ze,WarDamnSpurs,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:08:34 2015 UTC,"Studying abroad in London would be cool, because of obvious reasons, but you will not get the culture shock that you would in a non-english speaking country.  I did my study abroad in Florence, Italy and loved it. The way I did my trip was I got a multiple stop plane ticket to Europe and stopped in London for a Tottenham match. Then after, I flew to Rome and did some travelling around Italy. After my study abroad was done. I travelled around Eastern Europe for 2 weeks and then flew out of Amsterdam back to the states. I brought I large duffle and large packpack to Florence and then sent the duffle back home before my 2 weeks of travel.  My favorite place that I visited were: Florence, Prague, Munich, Budapest, and The Amalfi Coast. I didn't go to Spain, but my sister studied abroad in Sevilla and loved it. There is great soccer there too.  Honestly, I would try to make it to as many Tottenham games as you can, but study somewhere else that you will be more culture shocked."
coys,3cs1ze,TimMarben,2,Fri Jul 10 20:21:53 2015 UTC,Sounds like an amazing experience. Unfortunately classes start soon after the winter study abroad so I wouldn't have the chance for the 2 week trip as much as I'd like to do it. Budapest was actually my brother's favorite place that he's seen in Europe so that's cool that that is on your list.   I think I'm leaning more toward Spain or France/Belgium/Netherlan's. It'll be a tough choice. As much as I'd like to do London I think I'd rather go somewhere different. I plan on going to many Tottenham games once I graduate.
coys,3cs1ze,SHPKG,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:37:13 2015 UTC,"Basically you need to make the decision whether you would like to really get to know a place or only get a taste of a few places. It sounds like you would have more freedom with the Spain option, and then you could travel to France/Belgium/Netherlands. Even if you study in Spain, Ryan air is usually less than 100 Euros to London if you wanted to go to a game."

If he can't run by his man, he won't beat them as he's not very technical. He performs best when he has good players around him but absolutely disappears if he's by himself, like when Keane was hurt earlier this season. I will argue with the 'superstar persona'quote though, he has a good head on his shoulders and is willing to do what it takes for the team. He also has a terrible haircut."
coys,3cw1i0,NotFrenchAtAll,0,Sat Jul 11 12:40:09 2015 UTC,"Hey /u/NotFrenchAtAll, surely he's not ready for Spurs now, but could you not possibly see him in the future? I'm not a fully dedicated Galaxy fan like you are, but I have watched all of his US games and most of the Galaxy's play-off run last year. If he is making a household name for himself by performing with players like a 35-year old Keane, imagine what he could do with Kane. I agree the ""superstar status"" persona quote might've been a bit unwarranted."

I think he'd enjoy some success with us with Kane and others creating space and putting balls into the box but his game requires other people doing the hard work and he finishes them off from points that don't require much skill. If Soldado didn't work out for us, I think it would be nearly certain that Gyasi wouldn't work out. I'd love to see it though.   That said, good on you for writing this.

I appreciated your first two articles because they were based on concrete issues about one of Spurs existing players (Yedlin's performance, compensation to his youth club) but please don't just pick US and MLS players every month and speculate as to whether they might make it to Spurs one day. That just strengthens the US circlejerk and is something this sub doesn't need.  (edit: what I should say is don't post them here, feel free to do whatever you want with your writing on your tumblr page! I don't want to stifle creativity, just don't expect it to do well here)"
coys,3cw1i0,Panencephalitis,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:20:53 2015 UTC,"I've quickly realized that /r/coys doesn't like USA/MLS hahaha. The reason I am only focusing on US/MLS players is because I'm trying to build a portfolio to become a writer/correspondent on these specific areas, because they are the areas that I know best. If I simply focused on players from around the world, there are countless other Spurs blogs that do the same.  I will be holding off on USA/MLS postings on Reddit, but will be doing analysis on international friendlies/Euro/Gold Cup performances. Does that seem good?"
coys,3cw1i0,Panencephalitis,2,Sun Jul 12 02:30:44 2015 UTC,"That's absolutely fine if its a Spurs player! I can't promise it will do well unless you do updates on multiple players for Spurs because otherwise it's just a periodic Yedlin report, which at this point is very circlejerky since he has barely sniffed the first team for us.   And it's not that /r/coys or other EPL subs don't like the MLS, in fact lots of us are fans of MLS teams as well, it's that pure speculation on your part of what players might look good in the PL eventually is just pointless content.  It also doesn't help when you don't seem to know the players that well. I know that you are just starting but if you do intend to do that make sure you are doing more than just ""watching Zardes in his USMNT appearances"", it diminishes the validity of your opinion. If the player you ""review"" is in the MLS and American every time it's very biased. ie: ""This guy is American! Yedlin is American! Maybe they can both play for Spurs!""  edit: Also the MLS has it's own sub that would be a more appropriate place to post content like that. You would obviously have to be more general about making the jump to the EPL as opposed to Spurs specifically."

coys,3coaoi,coocookuhchoo,11,Thu Jul 9 14:46:54 2015 UTC,"Since we're using this thread to talk about Yedlin generally, is signing someone ""for shirt sales"" really a thing?  Would the amount a club like Spurs makes off shirt sales of a player like Yedlin really be enough to cover wages and transfer fee and make a profit on top of that?    edit: Honestly?  Why the hell is this downvoted?"
coys,3coaoi,p_gascoigne,21,Thu Jul 9 14:51:44 2015 UTC,"Not shirt sales...but getting shown during prime time on TV in the U.S., getting lots of media attention in the U.S. (Spurs will be mentioned in any article written about the national team) etc.   We have done similar deals in the past. Bongani Khumalo was signed from a club owned by the same man that owns Supersport (the network that controls Premier League rights for sub-Saharan Africa)."
coys,3coaoi,coocookuhchoo,25,Thu Jul 9 14:57:45 2015 UTC,"That makes sense.  So ""shirt sales"" is a euphemism for general publicity and exposure."
coys,3coaoi,ltlistenerftposter,9,Thu Jul 9 14:59:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's not literally shirt sales, that wouldn't cover jack. Tottenham knows they already have a strong US marketing hold due to Dempsey/Friedel and the strong jewish population in the US, it makes sense businesswise to have at least one US player on the roster to globally build the brand."
coys,3coaoi,MadArend,4,Thu Jul 9 15:23:50 2015 UTC,"The Khumalo signing, for sure, but do we have any idea how well it actually worked?  According to Transfermarkt, we bought him for 1.5m ... I wonder how much new South African revenue we got that we wouldn't have gotten just from the growth in the worldwide popularity of the league.  On the other hand, we bought Dempsey ostensibly for on-pitch reasons, but the US marketing bump we got from him was immense.  The US obviously offers orders of magnitude more opportunity than South Africa, but Yedlin's not nearly as big a name as Dempsey was."
coys,3coaoi,p_gascoigne,6,Thu Jul 9 17:07:15 2015 UTC,"The Khumalo signing   I imagine the club directors weren't too concerned about the South African market in of itself. I imagine they were more interested in developing close ties with the guy (the owner of the club we signed Khumalo from) that controls televised football in all of sub-Saharan Africa. The club we signed Khumalo from is even named after said network.    At the same time, just like with Yedlin, it is not completely out of the question that they could (can) develop into decent footballers."
coys,3coaoi,MadArend,2,Thu Jul 9 17:18:59 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  TIL that SuperSport had/has Premier League broadcasting rights across sub-Saharan Africa.  I still wonder if it actually paid dividends -- were we broadcast on primary stations more than other clubs, did our supportership increase more than other clubs, etc."
coys,3coaoi,p_gascoigne,2,Thu Jul 9 18:39:43 2015 UTC,"SuperSport    I doubt it is something that has much monetary value that can be counted outright as such.   But, just like it behooves any club-owner to be on good terms with SKY, it is equally important to be on good terms with whoever owns the TV rights in new markets. After all, TV is what makes money in contemporary football.  In a completely rhetorical example we can consider whether it is useful to have a good relationship with the owners of the network in a case where SuperSport is deciding on whether or not they would want to broadcast the UEFA league."
coys,3coaoi,MadArend,2,Thu Jul 9 18:50:33 2015 UTC,"TV is what makes money in contemporary football.   True, but it comes down to how TV money makes it to the club, and whether we would get any marginal advantage from having a good relationship with the broadcasting network.  Having a good relationship with British broadcasters is important because 25% of domestic TV revenue is allocated in proportion to the number of appearances.  Good relationships with overseas broadcasters are irrelevant for league revenue because all overseas TV revenue is distributed equally amongst all teams.  As for the UEFA Cup, the only aspect of revenue distribution that is not fixed or based on performance is the ""market pool,"" but as I understand it, that's allocated in proportion to the domestic TV deals with UEFA and is unaffected by any preference for us that an overseas network might have.  Plus, as a whole, sub-Saharan TV revenue for the UEFA Cup would be small, our relative share of it would be a pittance, and it wouldn't be affected in any way by our having a good relationship with SuperSport.  SS would buy the rights solely on the basis of whether or not they deemed it profitable.  Also, I'd discount the future pretty heavily, as it's always possible that in 3 years someone else will hold the rights.  All of which is why I'd say the real value of a good relationship with SuperSport (and by extension, the Khumalo deal) comes down to how much relative exposure and fan base growth we've gotten in the past four years, the value of which can be long-lasting but difficult to quantify."
coys,3coaoi,p_gascoigne,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:16:23 2015 UTC,"Alright, I guess you are right, we bought Khumalo purely based on his athletic abilities..."
coys,3coaoi,MadArend,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:19:49 2015 UTC,"Haha, that's not what I'm saying at all.  I'm just saying that the value of the deal is in greater exposure relative to our rivals, and I wonder whether we actually got that or if it was just a waste of 1.5m (not counting the fodder for humor on this sub that it provided)."

I don't know if that's fair or not."" Upon further consideration, Luck circles back to the question to define his affiliation. ""The team that I follow completely is the Houston Dynamo,"" he says. ""That's my No. 1 team in my heart because my father used to work for that club [as founding president and general manager],"" he said.

coys,3cnvzj,jbungels132,12,Thu Jul 9 13:18:32 2015 UTC,I think now that our goals as a club are that much closer to being realized he's finally ready to take that next step and break the cycle we've been in recently
coys,3cnvzj,irishbball49,8,Thu Jul 9 14:51:22 2015 UTC,"That was my thought as well.   Especially with the new stadium coming in to picture and a more risk-averse near future to look forward to, he/they is more open and able to be proactive."
coys,3cnvzj,Lou3000,9,Thu Jul 9 16:15:58 2015 UTC,"ENIC has to feel pretty great right now.  Compare the situation now to a few years ago.  Redknapp's at the helm and he loves to spend on older talent.  The CPO and new stadium are years away and not guaranteed.  And, the club has some outstanding debts from the ENIC purchase.  In that situation, CL or bust is the only way to spend money.  Levy and ENIC have been very careful not to spend money we don't have, and relied on keeping transfers in equal to transfers out.  Now, you've got tons of new revenue streams available (New stadium, NFL, upcoming TV deal) AND you have a manager that seems to be satisfied with buying youth at a lower transfer fee.  Our new CB only cost 11M!"
coys,3cnvzj,TheyDidItFirst,6,Thu Jul 9 15:33:58 2015 UTC,"I don't think Redknapp was particularly devoted to buying older talent, but the team seemed so close to breaking into the next level that buying prospects that wouldn't be able to contribute for a few seasons wasn't a priority (it was ENIC's unwillingness/inability to spend on players that could make an immediate impact & were on the young side that resulted in transfers like Saha and Nelson as temporary cover).   Basically, Levy and Poch are focusing on youth now because the team has actually regressed since then but it's a good way to keep the team competitive and the fans happy/hopeful."
coys,3cnvzj,irishbball49,3,Thu Jul 9 17:28:12 2015 UTC,Wonder what the #ENICOUT folks are thinking.
coys,3cnvzj,Lou3000,2,Thu Jul 9 16:16:36 2015 UTC,"I don't think the ENICOUT people have really changed.  There is still a contingent that sees Levy running Spurs in order to cash out.  StubHub, NFL, etc. are great for revenue, but many would question how they are good for the fans."
coys,3cnvzj,jmoneygreen,5,Thu Jul 9 16:47:06 2015 UTC,"The only legitimate argument those people have is that we could get someone who would irresponsibly throw money at the team, Enic's 'failure' or whatever is so vastly overrated"
coys,3cnvzj,Devilb0y,7,Thu Jul 9 17:05:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's fair at all. I don't agree with those people, but to completely dismiss their point of view is pretty disrespectful.  As someone who goes to the Lane regularly it's undisputable that the atmosphere at the ground is worse than it was 10-15 years ago, before we were bought by the ENIC group. There's a strong argument that the decline in atmosphere is due to the increase in ticket prices, which has forced a lot of long-time Spurs fans out of the ground. This is indicative of a wider problem with the ENIC ownership, which is that they have always been focused on ensuring Spurs are profitable, often at the expense of the fans.  It is not an issue of those fans who oppose their ownership unilaterally insisting that they should be spending more money so we can win things. It is an issue of fans wanting to have a bit more given back to them by a club which makes a lot of money off of them."
coys,3cnvzj,SZJX,0,Thu Jul 9 18:42:01 2015 UTC,Modern business as always? I guess if you don't run a club with profitability as top priority it's just not in line with normal business logic. Though maybe Spurs could have done more for fans indeed. Still many more badly run clubs are out there.

Can't wait to see what's in store next"

coys,3cnvzj,hautspurs,7,Thu Jul 9 18:26:33 2015 UTC,"No one gets all the deals they want done early. I'm not too worried about the rest of the window. I think Levy has a shopping list and is going to get through it. The defense is sorted (now waiting to offload Kaboul and one more, probably Vlad). There are a few prospective buyers for each, but I think he's gonna haggle for the best price possible which could drag things out. We need a defensively inclined box to box midfielder to run the double pivot with Bentaleb and a backup striker.   We've been linked with interested to James McCarthy, which I am a huge fan of. Is 24 but has plenty of EPL experience. Is not exactly 100% settled at Everton. High energy, defensively solid, and tidy if unspectacular in possession.  I'll settle for a backup striker that can score a goal from open play from time to time. Not really hard to improve on Soldado and Adebayor's recent production."
coys,3cnvzj,xxRaymxx,3,Thu Jul 9 15:29:57 2015 UTC,"An itk said McCarthy is last priority as he has fitness worries, our main 2 targets for the cdm spot are in other leagues apparently"
coys,3cnvzj,hautspurs,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:51:20 2015 UTC,"Fair enough then, but I still think he'd do well for us. Did the ITK say what the main targets were?"
coys,3cnvzj,xxRaymxx,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:15:55 2015 UTC,He said that we have two targets abroad which I assume are rabiot and Kramer and then Morgan schneiderlin I'd assume is the third but I'm guessing rabiot is the most likely scenario as united will probably get schneiderlin and Kramer has champions league and just signed a contract extension.  We are also linked with a wide man and a 2nd striker but fuck knows who they are
coys,3cnvzj,hautspurs,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:30:40 2015 UTC,"I am not sure that Rabiot and Kramer are the two targets. Both have CL football where they are at, and neither club seems to have to sell them. I know Rabiot is unhappy at PSG, but he signed a 5 year extension, so clearly he had some reason to stay, otherwise he would have foolishly handed over any leverage he had. And even if he wanted to go, PSG had reason to extend his contract, and probably won't let him walk easily.   I don't know who the targets actually are, I guess I'm just being a negative nancy and am a bit skeptical that we're going to turn heads from guys who have spots and contracts on CL teams."
coys,3cnvzj,xxRaymxx,3,Fri Jul 10 16:19:09 2015 UTC,I just like being optimistic and then having my dreams crushed ;)

It's all very exciting, which is scary - I hate being optimistic for the new season, especially with who we have first up.... But even then if we don't get a result there it wouldn't be the end of the world, it's all a marathon not a sprint..."

coys,3cnvzj,qiuhaf7qyh,32,Thu Jul 9 11:11:10 2015 UTC,"well united are likely going to end having brought in depay, schneiderlin, darmian, and potentially the likes of otamendi, ramos,  + sterling, and will be gunning hard for lloris. unfair comparison I know.. but that's rather impressive"
coys,3cnvzj,mappsy91,30,Thu Jul 9 11:31:29 2015 UTC,Liverpool seem to have done pretty well too... annoyingly
coys,3cnvzj,Messisfoot,16,Thu Jul 9 11:56:15 2015 UTC,Liverpool bought any player they could get their hands off. It seems like they did pretty well but how many players will they have to offload?
coys,3cnvzj,grawlyx,4,Thu Jul 9 13:42:53 2015 UTC,I honestly think we'll see a few flops from their signings. Firmino chief amongst them.

coys,3cnvzj,nbg91,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:29:57 2015 UTC,"I mean overall including stadium and nfl stuff, Liverpool fans have dmt he whole sterling saga to dead with, which  reminds me of modric, not fun. Utd I agree.   Maybe I was just getting swept up for a minute"
coys,3cnvzj,TheyDidItFirst,2,Thu Jul 9 21:41:50 2015 UTC,Losing Sterling is bad but I don't think he's nearly as important to Liverpool now as Modric was (although he certainly has the talent to be). The pain for 'pool fans comes because he's making it so clear that they're a stepping stone club despite their delusions of grandeur.
coys,3cnvzj,n3gotiator,11,Thu Jul 9 23:16:06 2015 UTC,"Shhhhh. I like our signings, please don't over-hype or they'll turn out to be Chiricheses."
coys,3cnvzj,waffuls1,4,Thu Jul 9 11:59:31 2015 UTC,"Plenty. As much cunts as they are, Liverpool's has been quite decent aside from the Sterling hooplah, although I don't believe anything will come of that, Juventus has had a fantastic transfer window so far, and if United bring in Darmian on top of Depay, they immediately strengthen a significant amount in two areas. Chelsea basically need to not lose anyone and they'll have a brilliant transfer window considering almost all of their important players are young too. We've been doing well for ourselves thus far but it's important to not lose perspective."

coys,3cnvzj,nbg91,2,Thu Jul 9 21:45:40 2015 UTC,"Well all of the above have been clearly needed for the last 12 months.   The spine the team is still the same: lloris verts bent eriksen Kane etc.  A strong do to play next to bentaleb, a young striker to help share the load with Kane, and a winger/inside forward type because we lack depth and quality there"

The A's are perennially that team on the edge of being really great, but due to financial constraints never quite get there.   Sound familiar?  That said, the biggest similarity I see between the two is that they are both incredibly fun teams to watch that will in the end only leave you heartbroken. Yet every season, you come crawling back for more because in with the failure, there are those glorious moments (5-3 new years day; Coming back from 20+ games back to win the division on the final day in 2012 just to name a few examples). They are both teams that believe in winning and doing it in the right way, and doing it in a way that is exciting to watch. For me, it always just felt right"

Being in the shadow of a bigger payroll team with extremely annoying fans and selling off all the great players constantly. Reaching the playoffs constantly but always exiting early. I can't deal with that from another team. 2012 was amazing because it was a slow climb to the top.   I wouldn't call it winning the ""right"" way since that's more of a St. Louis Cardinals thing.

I had a guy like that next to me at WHL against Man Utd just after Christmas and the fucking guy wouldn't shut up with his passive aggressive complaints about how shit the crowd are these days etc etc. I have NO problem at all with him jumping about, shouting, chanting whatever.

I think it depends on where you are in the stands, some stands are notoriously louder and more boisterous than other other sections. I think what I was trying to get at is, people going in spending a shit ton of money on Stubhub for say the NLD, then sitting in the Park Lane, and complaining to the stewards or whomever that the guy next to him wont sit down or is giving the wanker sign to Wilshire."
coys,3cp1pf,LlamaExpert,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:35:23 2015 UTC,"It keeps devoted fans out of the stands (there are 40k+ waiting to be season-ticket holders) and rich tourists that don't give a fuck in. This combination destroys the atmosphere at WHL. I guess in America this is not as big of an issue considering there really is not much organic crowd involvement outside of college sports.  Without StubHub it is much more difficult to offload tickets at a profit and people would be less willing to purchase a season ticket if they knew it would be harder to sell them for profit.  There are perhaps some other elements I'm missing, but overall Stubhub is one of the biggest issues dedicated supporters have with the moderns state of the club...and something can be done about it if people speak out."

You are correct in that it is somewhat slippery to be throwing around the ""No True Scotsman"" fallacy; it it is ultimately not productive to argue what makes a true fan. What I failed to articulate boils down to Windy's comment, that StubHub just makes it easier for Spurs fans to rip each other off. I don't live in London, but it seems to be a serious issue if groups like 1882 are so adamantly against it.  Here is a quote from this article:  ""There are a number of reasons to object to the club’s deal with StubHub. Some are ethical, some more practical. The principle that you don’t sell tickets to other fans for over face value is as basic as never changing your team and it’s a core part of the social solidarity that holds supporters together.""

Some could argue that those willing to fly thousands of miles to watch them ""deserve"" (whatever the hell that means) those tickets even more, btw. but I'm not getting into that here.   I will say this much: atmosphere is very important. In recent years the atmosphere at ALL Premier League clubs has declined, not just Spurs. Whether that is due to StubHub, globalization, increased recognition of Spurs global brand and influx of tourists, or unreasonable expectations following the 2010 Champion's League run is totally up for debate. Correlation is certainly not causation, but all of these things have been happening around the same time-period. Fighting globalization and foreign influence on the Premier League is ultimately futile and foolish. However, renegotiating terms with StubHub seems a comparatively realistic option. I was not able to find how much Spurs receive from StubHub, but none of the ticket-markup by resellers goes to the club.

The atmosphere can be made great or terrible by both local and 'tourist' alike, quit pretending otherwise.   You bring a fantastic point. The Fighting Cock fellas have talked about this numerous times, there are plenty of crotchety and entitled local fans that would rather stew in their own misery at games instead of sing. The atmosphere argument is certainly more nuanced in that sense.   ""not much organic crowd involvement outside of college sports"" - jesus this is just so dumb I'm not going to bother.   Honestly? I can't remember the last NFL, MLB, NHL, or NBA game I went to where there was any organized crowd singing. I mean, sure the Seattle Seahawks broke Galatasaray's noise-decibels record, but it was just cacophony in a stadium designed to artificially increase noise levels. Serious question though: outside of the MLS and college sports, where will you ever find crowd involvement that is not prompted by a jumbotron? I'm not trying to be a dick, the difference in crowd-involvement is what drew me to Spurs in the first place."

coys,3cp1pf,tommygoogy,2,Fri Jul 10 08:29:17 2015 UTC,"I'd prefer they put a max % increase on the face value cost of a ticket. That prevents people reselling at a ridiculous premium. Upping that by a max of 25% would be the most I would tolerate. Tickets should be for the fans, not seen as an investment."
coys,3cp1pf,theoracle101,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:09:31 2015 UTC,Season ticket holders rejoice everywhere
coys,3cp1pf,tommygoogy,2,Thu Jul 9 19:22:51 2015 UTC,no we aren't
coys,3cp1pf,scandanavianleather,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:36:13 2015 UTC,I should have said some
coys,3cp1pf,OAKgravedigger,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:52:09 2015 UTC,the only people rejoicing are those who enjoy ripping off fellow fans
coys,3cpyef,JakeSpurs,8,Thu Jul 9 20:57:58 2015 UTC,"I agree that we need some experience in our team, it's a bit too young at the moment but Cambiasso is a little https://i.imgflip.com/mqvlh.jpg .  Krychowiak is my favourite option."
coys,3cpyef,swiper33,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:26:31 2015 UTC,The difference being Cambiasso is free and Krychowiak would be 23+million Euro.
coys,3cpyef,Panencephalitis,7,Fri Jul 10 17:01:02 2015 UTC,For the song alone:  Esteban Cambiasso - he's magic - you knoooowwwwww (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVmQixBFSpA).
coys,3cpyef,WindyCOYS,2,Thu Jul 9 21:06:49 2015 UTC,"They should be rhyming ""Esteban"" with ""Leicester-fan"".  This is a disgrace. We might as well take him at this point."
coys,3cpyef,swiper33,14,Thu Jul 9 23:25:02 2015 UTC,Too old. Would be a short term fix for a long term problem.
coys,3cpyef,ysdlexic,31,Thu Jul 9 21:09:38 2015 UTC,Sometimes that's not always a bad thing if he can get a job done.
coys,3cpyef,qop666,32,Thu Jul 9 21:18:06 2015 UTC,^ This. See Scott Parker
coys,3cpyef,BadatMatth,23,Thu Jul 9 22:10:04 2015 UTC,I agree but... Ryan Nelsen.
coys,3cpyef,mpw90,7,Thu Jul 9 22:44:28 2015 UTC,You can counter any signing we make by comparing it to a failed one. Gotta take chances.
coys,3cpyef,mattwise15,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:46:23 2015 UTC,UNPOPULAR OPINION KLAXON  I actually thought Nelsen did reasonably well at Spurs.
coys,3cpyef,problemsdog,11,Fri Jul 10 10:31:46 2015 UTC,Scott Parker   We signed Scotty half a decade ago. Cambiasso and Parker are exactly the same age...
coys,3cpyef,p_gascoigne,5,Fri Jul 10 01:18:31 2015 UTC,But one is truly generational talent who should be considered one of the very best CMs of the last 15 years. His influence on Inter's treble winning sides can't be overstated and Leicester don't stay up last season without him. Cambiasso and Parker are seriously leagues apart and it's not unreasonable to think Cambiasso could do a job for us next season.
coys,3cpyef,SHPKG,7,Fri Jul 10 03:36:35 2015 UTC,"But one is truly generational talent who should be considered one of the very best CMs of the last 15 years.    I agree Parker was fantastic. Harry just had the magic touch at making him run around a bit.  Oh, you wrote more words?"
coys,3cpyef,ari_hess,10,Fri Jul 10 05:13:18 2015 UTC,"I'd prefer us investing heavily in a quality CDM who can be with us for many years, but I'd also take Cambiasso anyway if he's available on a free.  He's always been quality and we have so few senior players with his level of experience, so I'd love to see him teaching Bentaleb and Mason a thing or two."
coys,3cpyef,Buffaluffasaurus,5,Thu Jul 9 22:41:31 2015 UTC,But might we already have the long term answer in Dele Alli and just need a short term stopgap?
coys,3cpyef,mickeybell3,8,Fri Jul 10 01:17:20 2015 UTC,"I think this sub has turned into a lot of anti-older players we already have a lot of young talent developing I don't see a problem with having a veteran like Cambiasso coming in, although I think he in particular would be useless to us because if Leicester don't want to keep him then why should we take him?"
coys,3cpyef,95enjoipanda,14,Thu Jul 9 22:06:39 2015 UTC,He is waiting to find out who Leicester's new manager is before signing on again. It's not Leicester that doesn't want him it's him deciding if he wants Leicester
coys,3cpyef,nrolo24,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:08:58 2015 UTC,"Ah that makes more sense, I thought it would be odd for them to let him go, I only watched a few Leicester matches and can't say I ever noticed his play though."
coys,3cpyef,95enjoipanda,3,Thu Jul 9 22:11:30 2015 UTC,I think he could provide for us similar to what Lampard did for City last season. Veteran sub in the second half. Be nice to have someone who actually has won some stuff out there on the field. The Chelsea game was amazing but it was insanity. Some composure in the midfield and we may not have needed 5 goals.
coys,3cpyef,nrolo24,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:14:34 2015 UTC,Maybe he's behind the weird Preki job offer?
coys,3cpyef,ari_hess,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:14:31 2015 UTC,I'm not really sure how Preki would be on Cambiasso's radar. Be surprised if he keeps up on his Sacremento FC games
coys,3cpyef,nrolo24,4,Fri Jul 10 12:45:00 2015 UTC,Always for signing experienced heads.  Naybet and Davids have shown that these characters in the squad do wonders for the mental attitude of the team and are great for the young players
coys,3cpyef,Roshambo2110,0,Thu Jul 9 21:43:12 2015 UTC,"Naybet and Davids were great when we were moving from the bottom-half/middle of the table to the top 4/5 spots.   For a squad of our quality now players like that don't bring much. And, keep in mind Davids was on the field when we threw it all away against West Ham in '06."
coys,3cpyef,p_gascoigne,3,Thu Jul 9 23:42:20 2015 UTC,"You can't blame Edgar for that, unless he cooked the lasagne..."
coys,3cpyef,agonynine,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:21:21 2015 UTC,"Not blaming him, just pointing out that by the time he made it to us he wasn't the sort of player to calm things down and keep a level head."
coys,3cpyef,p_gascoigne,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:22:31 2015 UTC,"Just jesting, to be honest he never seemed the kind of guy to calm things down, when young he was aggressive and reckless, when old he still had that bite if he needed it :)"
coys,3cpyef,agonynine,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:31:03 2015 UTC,That bite was much needed for the Spurs-culture we had at the time.
coys,3cpyef,p_gascoigne,2,Fri Jul 10 01:01:52 2015 UTC,"Davids was an unbelievable influence on and off the pitch, and far from being a bottom half/middle table player at the time, I'll remind you that the collapse against West Ham was what cost us 4TH place that year, not 10th or 11th."
coys,3cpyef,Roshambo2110,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:06:52 2015 UTC,"Oh, I thought this whole time that  Lasagna-gate was about us losing 11th.  Anyway, in that season, except Carrick, our central midfield options were Tainio, Murphy, and Jenas. All very much mid-table sort of stuff. We needed aging stars to push us up from a mediocrity."
coys,3cpyef,p_gascoigne,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:51:44 2015 UTC,They certainly weren't mid-table players at the time - we weren't 4th/5th by accident.
coys,3cpyef,Roshambo2110,2,Fri Jul 10 15:43:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, of course, they were all top-notch.   Danny Murphy sandwiching his Spurs days between the great clubs of Charlton and Fulham was the envy of the rest of the top 4. How we managed to keep all the suitors of Jenas at bay is nothing short of remarkable. Alas, we did lose Tainio for Sunderland's reserve team not long after.  Don't get me wrong, I love Jenas. He helped us move from a life around mid-table to ""best of the rest"". But, at the same time, it is not as if he would ever start for any of the top-4 teams.  There is an obvious reason that every season after Lasagna-gate, until we started playing Modric and Huddlestone/Palacios centrally in our midfield, we finished closer to 10th/11th than Champions League qualification."
coys,3cpyef,p_gascoigne,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:05:13 2015 UTC,"IIRC we came 5th, 6th, 11th, and 8th?"
coys,3cpyef,Doomchicken7,2,Fri Jul 10 20:43:00 2015 UTC,"There were no 6th in there. And when we did make it to 5th, in terms of points, we were closer to 10th than we were to Arsenal at 4th. And, importantly, that season we didn't spend a single week inside the top 4. We did beat Chelsea  at home though.  Anyway, the gap in quality between our midfield and the top 4 was staggering."
coys,3cpyef,p_gascoigne,3,Sat Jul 11 14:43:05 2015 UTC,"Would not be opposed as long as his wages are within reason. He's a leader, his mentality probably helped Leicester avoid relegation all together. We lack experience in the squad, I think he could help guide younger players like Nabil, and even help Mason improve."
coys,3cpyef,macky909,2,Fri Jul 10 01:54:56 2015 UTC,"I have been thinking about this for a week. Played on great teams, year of premier league experience, solid depth addition. Also Argentinian so could hang with Lamela tell him it's all going to be OK.  In all seriousness though, I think it's worth giving him a look. Could provide nice experience to our youth."
coys,3cpyef,nrolo24,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:06:02 2015 UTC,Scott Parker Mark II. Would love it.
coys,3cpyef,grawlyx,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:20:28 2015 UTC,I watched quite a few of their games just last year. I would take him in a second. the man is a legend. period. this would feel like a Gallas signing for me. 1-2 years left with plenty to give.
coys,3cpyef,villainoust,-1,Fri Jul 10 05:53:30 2015 UTC,Was he even that good last season? Seems like he was okay for 3/4 of the season then when Leicester decided to turn up for games towards the end of the season he played well. Don't see the point in papering over the cracks in a position we need genuine top quality in.
coys,3cpyef,COYCOYS,6,Thu Jul 9 23:10:14 2015 UTC,He was one of their most important players. If he doesn't want too much money I think he'd be awesome to have for a season.
coys,3cpyef,bbqchxpizza,3,Thu Jul 9 23:23:42 2015 UTC,"Did you actually watch Leicester play much? He looked absolutely class in a Leicester team that looked terrible until the final sprint. Sure, he's old, but he would be on a free, and I doubt his contract would be very costly at all."
coys,3cpyef,theninjanipples,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:09:26 2015 UTC,"No, I didn't. I'm going of what a friend who supports Leicester tells me. Still stand by what I said papering over the cracks and all."
coys,3cpyef,COYCOYS,2,Fri Jul 10 12:31:39 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I probably only watched about 10 full games, but whenever I saw him he looked very good - intelligent defensively, and still has the eye for an excellent pass from deep (something you feel would be easier to execute with Kane instead of Vardy).  Obviously it's not long term, but he could stay play two seasons. Look at what Parker brought us, and Cambiasso is much better.  I love having youth prospects, but the reality is that most players don't stay longer than four seasons - so why not play the short game occasionally? We certainly need experience, and as he's a free transfer, it's not long we couldn't sign another CDM."
coys,3cpyef,theninjanipples,-8,Fri Jul 10 13:39:12 2015 UTC,No
