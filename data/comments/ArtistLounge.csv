ArtistLounge,3e25ve,adillac,4,Tue Jul 21 11:20:48 2015 UTC,"As promised a long time ago to u/k0nundrum , u/JetDog and u/KitWilliamsMask - I finally got to make the test of the Caran d'Ache fancolor watersoluble colour pencils. As my camera is not bad, but in no ways a pro quality scanner (hehe), I've made some close-ups, in which I have included a grayscale (darkest is 100% black, 3 values of grey, printed on white paper), just in case someone would like to gamma- or brightness-set their monitor to have a better look. :) Here they are: close-up 1 ; close-up 2 ; close-up 3 ; and close-up 4 .   It was an interesting exercise, especially because, though most colours behaved as you would expect them to (getting softer and more diluted when water added), the reds and the pale blues actually became more saturated when wet. Which means they tend to take over everthing.... :-/ Black: even with very little water, it immediately washes out to a pale grey. :p Pink and white: very hard to wash at all, the lines almost always stay visible. I'm so not going to use them for hatching anymore, if I want to wash them down afterwards.   Any questions, fire away. ;)"

ArtistLounge,3dzip4,follymiser,2,Mon Jul 20 21:38:04 2015 UTC,How was the process with selling at the local store?  Did you approach a mom and pop place?  Any initial hurdles?
ArtistLounge,3dzip4,follymiser,3,Mon Jul 20 21:42:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I just fell into the right group of people when I moved here. The store is called Trohv, They've got a location in Baltimore and one in DC. I met the owner, she is a total sweetheart, and I just went in and showed her my work. It fit her style and they sell REALLY well, so she basically lets me bring in whatever I want, whenever I want. I set the prices, I manage the inventory, it's a really sweet deal. Plus, the store is like THE place to get gifts in Baltimore, it's a seriously great place and it gets tons and tons of foot traffic, so the only hurdle is keeping up with the demand!"

ArtistLounge,3e0u2a,feathers89,4,Tue Jul 21 02:17:12 2015 UTC,"Hey there! Would love to help you out with this conundrum.  I'm a trained actor and love to draw.  I feel like each one compliments the other.  In theatre you're told, ""if you see something. Something an actor does that you like. Steal it."" Take it.   Because it may be Robert De Niro's gesture, but your not Robert De Niro. And that's what makes you special. You're you.  There's plagiarism and then there's practice.  When I see something I really like from an artist I will designate a sketch book to emulating whatever that is.  It helps me with my technique and then I can take that and add it to all the other techniques I've acquired.  I mean we all learned how to draw a circle.  And if you feel that your work is too similar to a certain artists, that just means you've probably gotten all you need from that one artist and then you can research other artists.  And that's so much  fun, finding new and different artists.  Going to the museum or signing up for art newsletters. Just to find the next muse.    I think I rambled there a bit.  I hope that ramble helped.  Feel free to ask for clarification or questions or comments.   Things."
ArtistLounge,3e0u2a,ZachDoodles,4,Tue Jul 21 05:00:07 2015 UTC,"Digging into this question there are three big avenues of discussion. 1) If you are worried that you are copying someone else's style then you might be craving some new direction in your work 2) legally there are some interesting cases that define the question in ways you as an individual wouldn't necessarily 3) case studies can provide useful information toward making up your mind.  Especially in this milieu of digital manipulation using stock photos for surreal effects, there is a lot of overlap among artists. So, visually I would say the aesthetic might be a symptom of the medium. I.e, wood cut prints tend to look similar and so do digital collages.   On a personal level, artists usually know when they are intentionally ripping someone off and it often is seen most black and white in the form of conceptual art. For example, if someone is basically retelling the same joke a BANKSY piece already made but using different subjects."
ArtistLounge,3e0u2a,seanmillsartist,2,Tue Jul 21 06:10:17 2015 UTC,"Well, it depends. Everything we've ever learned through life is learned through emulation. If you want to learn to dance, you watch other people dance, and copy what they do, then you add some moves from other dancers / dances, and finally, you add your own panache so that you dance in your own way.   If you're completely ripping someone off, line for line, and selling that work as yours, then that's stealing. On the other hand, if you like the way that one artist shades, and the way another does line work, and lift elements of their styles, and then add your own coloring process, then congratulations, you created a new style! Someone will likely emulate that style from you in the near future.   Don't forget that classically trained artists learn styles (abstract, post-modernism, Gothic, Minimalism, Impressionism) that were all started by one artist and became the new hotness.   TL;DR : Everything's derivative, but you know when it's theft."
ArtistLounge,3e0xj4,danalyn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:47:01 2015 UTC,"This is the first I've read about it, and haven't really done much research, yet. I'll have to look more into it tomorrow...unless anyone else has some info here?  Here are a few bulletpoints from that link:  Here are the Basic Facts  ""The Next Great Copyright Act"" would replace all existing copyright law.  It would void our Constitutional right to the exclusive control of our work.  It would ""privilege"" the public's right to use our work.  It would ""pressure"" you to register your work with commercial registries.  It would ""orphan"" unregistered work.  It would make orphaned work available for commercial infringement by ""good faith"" infringers.  It would allow others to alter your work and copyright these ""derivative works"" in their own names.  It would affect all visual art: drawings, paintings, sketches, photos, etc.; past, present and future; published and unpublished; domestic and foreign.  Background  The demand for copyright ""reform"" has come from large Internet firms and the legal scholars allied with them. Their business models involve supplying the public with access to other people's copyrighted work. Their problem has been how to do this legally and without paying artists.  The ""reforms"" they've proposed would allow them to stock their databases with our pictures. This would happen either by forcing us to hand over our images to them as registered works, or by harvesting unregistered works as orphans and copyrighting them in their own names as ""derivative works.""  The Copyright Office acknowledges that this will cause special problems for visual artists but concludes that we should still be subject to orphan works law.  The ""Next Great Copyright Act"" would go further than previous Orphan Works Acts. The proposals under consideration include:  1.) The Mass Digitization of our intellectual property by corporate interests.  2.) Extended Collective Licensing, a form of socialized licensing that would replace voluntary business agreements between artists and their clients.  3.)  A Copyright Small Claims Court to handle the flood of lawsuits expected to result from orphan works infringements."

My color theory sucks so I can't say what to specifically do to fix it.   Also the size of the creature is a bit hard to read. If I look really hard I guess it is an extremely tall creature?

ArtistLounge,3dueuv,Enevon,2,Sun Jul 19 17:55:38 2015 UTC,"Ah cool! I recently started using an A5 as well, it's so much easier for quick sketches.  Well, it was kind of a weird journey. I basically had like a breakdown day due to a bunch of stresses and realised I wasn't really on the path I wanted to be on in terms of art. So I wrote a list of all the art jobs I could possibly do, then all the skills I have, and then tried to find a correlation between the two. Then I picked the one I had the most love for. That's when I realised that I really want to be a concept artist.  Since then I've been doing tons of research on how to get into concept art, and realised I have a very long road to take. But I discovered Concept Cookie, Noah Bradley's art camp as well as other YouTubers. Since then i've been following their videos much like a real art course, and something that kept popping up was master studies. It was daunting at first but I followed Noah Bradley's week 1 video and it really helped. =]"
ArtistLounge,3dueuv,AGamerDraws,3,Sun Jul 19 18:10:41 2015 UTC,"The reason I started at all was because I wanted to be able to do concept art. But I've tumbled into the portrait world on the way and been stuck there for a while now.  I do however collect a bunch of youtube channels with timelapses, critiques and lessons. So if you haven't seen them before, here are some extra good channels to watch:  Sycra is very good at teaching and have a very calm, clear and steady voice  FZD gives free lessons from their concept art school  Dave Rapoza, look for the Critters episodes as they do paintovers which are really eye opening to how you turn something lesser into a really great piece."

ArtistLounge,3dueuv,Brassawiking,3,Sun Jul 19 19:24:11 2015 UTC,Kicking out a drawing a day is awesome! And those RGDs have some intense rendering so you really were kicking ass!
ArtistLounge,3dueuv,k0nundrum,2,Mon Jul 20 04:18:23 2015 UTC,I actually did the last four yesterday :)
ArtistLounge,3dueuv,Madlutian,3,Mon Jul 20 09:12:44 2015 UTC,"I remember seeing that first RGD, and being in awe of your blending skills. Just gorgeous."
ArtistLounge,3dueuv,Brassawiking,3,Mon Jul 20 08:46:29 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Good blending should be a side-effect of my biggest problem of making things sharp and clear. I feel that I tend do make things fuzzy, especially noses if there aren't any strong lights at it."
ArtistLounge,3dueuv,Madlutian,2,Mon Jul 20 09:18:11 2015 UTC,"The features are sharp and clear, the skin is just blended perfectly as to look smooth and flawless, but also 3-dimensional. I find that balance terribly tricky -- too smooth and it looks flat, but too much focus on shading and it stops looking smooth."
ArtistLounge,3dueuv,AGamerDraws,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:12:16 2015 UTC,"Great job on all of them, but that first one is haunting."
ArtistLounge,3dueuv,AGamerDraws,2,Tue Jul 21 14:21:26 2015 UTC,Is that a good thing...?
ArtistLounge,3dueuv,Madlutian,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:46:02 2015 UTC,"That's a great thing. ""Haunting"" affects me emotionally, and usually has a feature that leaves an afterimage in my mind after I look away (in this case, the eyes)."
ArtistLounge,3dueuv,AGamerDraws,5,Tue Jul 21 16:01:26 2015 UTC,Did a bunch of sketches as soon as I got my Mac back home this week.  Here's a black and white RGD  Here's some composition practice  Here's some colour practice  Here's a little sketch I just did from a small detail in The Lament of Icarus.  About to try and do some skin/portrait practice. =]  Edit: Very quick sketch of a LoTR style tower to test out some layer settings.
ArtistLounge,3dueuv,Dmunman,2,Sun Jul 19 17:15:20 2015 UTC,Congrats on getting the Macbook back! And I spy a Thomas Moran study. More Hudson River School! :D (among a bunch of other great pieces you made obviously :P)
ArtistLounge,3dueuv,Dmunman,2,Mon Jul 20 04:20:38 2015 UTC,"I really like Moran's work, the lighting is great. =]"
ArtistLounge,3dueuv,slam_nine,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:15:13 2015 UTC,"I'm very impressed by the contrast and shading in that RGD piece. You contained chaos with that hair, and made the piece feel alive."
ArtistLounge,3dueuv,slam_nine,2,Tue Jul 21 14:26:57 2015 UTC,Thank you! I tried to stick to larger brushes instead of getting caught up in detail and it really helped to keep the expressiveness and energy that only sketches seem to capture.
ArtistLounge,3dueuv,k0nundrum,4,Tue Jul 21 14:32:37 2015 UTC,"Barn project hit a few curves.first for some reason my sight got real blurry real fast. Dr blames meds. Ugh. Two, acrylic seems to be getting mushy when it rains....even ones i did weeks ago. Gonna try oils to see if they put up with the weather better on the steel. http://imgur.com/9QOVIXl"
ArtistLounge,3dueuv,danalyn,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:33:18 2015 UTC,"Yikes, hopefully it's not too serious with your sight! :O And hmmm, I wonder what's going on with those acrylics. Once dried they should be pretty water resistant. What's the surface of the barn like?"
ArtistLounge,3dueuv,k0nundrum,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:23:04 2015 UTC,"Its painted steel. The paint crinkles and gets soft anywhere the paint gets thick. After rain it drys hard, but gets soft again next rain. Gonna switch to oil paint. I see the dr on wednesday, and getting surgery. Wish me luck."
ArtistLounge,3dueuv,danalyn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:00:45 2015 UTC,"Oh damn, surgery!? Sorry to hear that man. Don't even trip though. You'll rock that surgery. You're Dmunman. We expect no less :)"
ArtistLounge,3dueuv,Madlutian,4,Mon Jul 20 16:23:44 2015 UTC,I've been doing some pretty fun stuff with ink this week.  1  2  3  4  +today's RGD
ArtistLounge,3dsihk,MetroMusic86,6,Sun Jul 19 01:04:08 2015 UTC,"The purpose of this comment is to formally express my interest joining your social circle.  As my resume intimates, I have both had friends and been drawn before (although never concurrently).  Although it's true I do currently hold managerial positions in a few social circles, they're all part-time.  I'd be honored if you'd consider me for joker.  Think about it total wild card ya know ?!  p.s. this looks great! What a wonderfully rendered, excellently executed stellar concept."
ArtistLounge,3dsihk,NervousSwagger,4,Sun Jul 19 03:59:49 2015 UTC,"Wow, thank you! :D I will pass your application on to the personell manager of my social circle, he will call you back :D"

ArtistLounge,3dsihk,Shmoonify,3,Sun Jul 19 16:18:03 2015 UTC,"we're interested, please do."
ArtistLounge,3dsmxs,bellevuefineart,3,Sun Jul 19 01:50:24 2015 UTC,"Looks stellar, got all the colors down. Can't really get a grip of what medium this is, traditional or digital?"
ArtistLounge,3dsmxs,Brassawiking,2,Sun Jul 19 09:42:05 2015 UTC,Oil paint.
ArtistLounge,3dsmxs,fuckfuckshit,3,Sun Jul 19 14:23:59 2015 UTC,This looks like of of those photos where the artist paints her subjects to look like they're in a painting and then photographs them. Really captured the depth.
ArtistLounge,3dsmxs,fuckfuckshit,2,Sun Jul 19 16:21:39 2015 UTC,found it
ArtistLounge,3ds52k,nahtekcor,2,Sat Jul 18 22:52:55 2015 UTC,"Interesting, looks cool."
ArtistLounge,3ds52k,Dmunman,2,Sun Jul 19 00:55:56 2015 UTC,looks great but I cant tell whats going on with the legs.
ArtistLounge,3du2hd,TheMightyBeaver,2,Sun Jul 19 13:54:53 2015 UTC,It's based on this painting here: https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ni%C3%B1os_comiendo_uvas_y_mel%C3%B3n (boys eating grapes and a melon) by Bartolome Murillo. Apparently.
ArtistLounge,3du2hd,futini,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:18:01 2015 UTC,"Thank you, yea looks like it is based on this. Really awesome to know ty!"
ArtistLounge,3du2hd,funisher,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:51:48 2015 UTC,Have you reached out to any auction houses? Sometimes smaller/local auction houses will have open days where experts will be available on site to look at art and antiques. Might be worth looking into.
ArtistLounge,3du2hd,funisher,2,Sun Jul 19 16:01:30 2015 UTC,Know of any places online to sell this on?
ArtistLounge,3dtg3z,PessimisticOptimist1,2,Sun Jul 19 07:52:06 2015 UTC,"I just look at people who sort of remind me of that characters features, use those people as references and, sort of, copy and paste features in a way. Like if the nose fits, I draw that nose or if the eye shape is nice I draw the eye shape that way."
ArtistLounge,3dtg3z,eyes-of-argus,2,Sun Jul 19 08:10:31 2015 UTC,"I don't use any charts or anything, although I will create mood boards occasionally about the character that I want to create.  Real life is my main inspiration. If i'm struggling I'll go out to the shops, or get on a train or something. Go sit in a coffee shop and watch the people around you, how they stand, what clues you can gather about their life, how their little dog looks just like them etc.  Then if I need something more specific (e.g. armour) I will look at images of that type of thing throughout the ages and from different cultures and see how far I can push it's silhouette and keep it doing it's purpose.  I also find pumping out a ton of silly characters based around the concept that I want helps.  If i'm starting from absolute scratch, so there's no design/story to try and match to I will just pick one thing to base the character around; that could be a material, an element (scientific or fantasy like earth, fire, water...) a time period, an animal, an art style etc"
ArtistLounge,3drkfo,AGamerDraws,5,Sat Jul 18 19:46:30 2015 UTC,"That is wonderful, I love the light on/around the water."
ArtistLounge,3drkfo,sleepytimevanilla,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:02:12 2015 UTC,Thanks! I really enjoyed doing all the little sparkles. =]
ArtistLounge,3drkfo,funisher,3,Sat Jul 18 22:48:56 2015 UTC,"Llllllllaaaannnddsscaaapppeee!!! :DDD. I'm particularly stoked that you painted a Bierstadt because I saw a bunch of that dude's paintings at the Haggin Museum in Stockton, CA. Though admittedly, I am a little disappointed that that isn't a platypus on the beach. I'm not worried though because it would be a pretty easy adjustment to make.  Who's next? Some Hudson River School? Thomas Cole? Maybe John Frederick Kensett? Lassen? :P"
ArtistLounge,3drkfo,yersiniaD,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:39:56 2015 UTC,"Ah awesome! I bet they were really impressive irl. I was looking through a historical fine art website and it was bierstadt and Thomas Moran that kept catching my eye. Never seen these artists before but I really fell for them. =] I'll look up those artists when I'm back at my computer, may do a Lassen for the Lols haha! It felt nice to do a landscape, haven't done a colour landscape in a very long time. =3"
ArtistLounge,3drkfo,bmc1010,2,Sun Jul 19 02:10:49 2015 UTC,"I could probably take the piece further, particularly the sand and rock area, but I need to move on to new things. Any advice to do with master studies would be greatly appreciated as I am self teaching. =]  Edit: By the way, it was this video by Noah Bradley that inspired me to do this."
ArtistLounge,3drkfo,bmc1010,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:47:39 2015 UTC,"This is advice given kindly and from the heart.  The masters did not become masters by rushing past the sandy little details and onto new things. I get the point of capturing the whole impression and feel of the piece, which you've done very well, but there's a lot of substance and soul in the little details."
ArtistLounge,3drkfo,bellevuefineart,4,Sun Jul 19 14:54:04 2015 UTC,"I understand that, and i'm only spending 8 hours on these pieces where as the original masters would have spent far far longer, but I only have so much time reserved for CPD before I need to get back to my actual paid work.  Edit: I would rather spend a short amount of time gathering as much knowledge I can that I can apply to my other work, rather than rendering a piece for an eternity for the sake of trying to be as accurate as possible. I learnt so much from this and am ready to move onto another piece that I can learn from."
ArtistLounge,3drkfo,bellevuefineart,2,Sun Jul 19 15:43:36 2015 UTC,"I am a huge fan of master studies, great job!  I think doing studies has been by far the best way to learn for me.  Thanks for linking that vid too.  I have some of the 1600'ish studies that I've done in acrylic and oil up at http://bmc1010.imgur.com/ .  I think the studies are all mentioned as studies in the descrips."

ArtistLounge,3dq5lh,MetroMusic86,6,Sat Jul 18 10:45:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks you all for your comments and critique!! <3   To be honest right now I feel like a dick because of the title :D I assumed OP wouldn't reply anymore to any of the paintings because he already posted another RGD request, so I needed to vent a bit .. and then he did reply :D sorry OP!"
ArtistLounge,3dq5lh,AGamerDraws,2,Sat Jul 18 17:33:19 2015 UTC,Glad you finally got a response. =]
ArtistLounge,3dq5lh,CuriosityK,3,Sat Jul 18 19:37:22 2015 UTC,"It's gorgeous! The red background is striking, but lends vibrancy to the piece, and I like the way you brought the red into her face and shadows. Since you are asking for CC, the only thing I would critique is the arm above her head is a tiny bit dark, and it sinks into the background just slightly. But honestly, I love this painting. It's vibrant, the contrasts are good. You got the drapery of her shirt very nicely with some great color contrasts. The hat is fun. Overall, it's a strong piece of work."
ArtistLounge,3dq5lh,CuriosityK,2,Sat Jul 18 14:09:38 2015 UTC,"thank you for the very detailed feedback!! <3 you are right about the arm! this is the great thing about feedback - you are suddenly able to see how you can improve your work, which you couldn' t before. Thank you!"
ArtistLounge,3dq5lh,neodiogenes,3,Sat Jul 18 17:40:04 2015 UTC,"Welcome! If someone asks for CC, I like to try to give it, cuz when I ask for it, I don't want just general posts, I want ways to improve my work so I can be better at my work. It does take other people looking at your work and critiquing it for you to get better! Glad I could help. I do love the piece!"
ArtistLounge,3dq5lh,sleepytimevanilla,3,Sat Jul 18 18:05:47 2015 UTC,"Unless you're getting paid, always draw for yourself first, your audience second.   That way you won't be disappointed if you don't get the feedback you want.    You know you did a good job, and that's the best feeling of all."
ArtistLounge,3dq5lh,sleepytimevanilla,2,Sat Jul 18 16:33:55 2015 UTC,"you are absolutely right! in the process of painting I paint entirely for me, but after its finished its nice to have a feedback. especially in RGD. :) but OP replied now, I was too harsh D: just needed to vent I guess.."
ArtistLounge,3dq5lh,FoxtrotOscar23,6,Sat Jul 18 17:36:29 2015 UTC,"That is beautifully done, sorry OP was rude :("
ArtistLounge,3dq5lh,AGamerDraws,6,Sat Jul 18 11:26:03 2015 UTC,"thank you! OP replied now :D I was too fast with judging, I guess I just needed to vent a bit.."
ArtistLounge,3dq5lh,bellevuefineart,2,Sat Jul 18 17:40:44 2015 UTC,"Eh they only did it because they were reminded, your feelings were justified.  I looked at some of your other stuff, love your style!"
ArtistLounge,3dq5lh,Madlutian,2,Sat Jul 18 19:21:48 2015 UTC,This is a beautiful thing well done
ArtistLounge,3dpdks,sleepytimevanilla,3,Sat Jul 18 04:09:25 2015 UTC,"/u/puppy_time and /u/FoxtrotOscar23 I put a quick filter on the background in gimp and you are right, it would look much better and be easier to look at.  Just have to figure out how to get that loose (or more? >_> )with my painting, might need to involve more wine in the process next time. :D  Thanks for the help."
ArtistLounge,3dpdks,MetroMusic86,3,Sat Jul 18 19:42:15 2015 UTC,"Wine is always helpful! :D   While I agree that the background needs more vagueness, I have to say I love her facial expression! There is such longing and fragility that is also shown in your choice of colors. I love the sun that shines trhough the flowers on her right arm - for me these details make the painting so brilliant. I would maybe add some more contrast, like a tiny highlight on her cheek in very light yellow, some subtle highlight in her hair, so you really get the impression of midday sun. and maybe a little more darkness (but not just black, maybe a hint of purple?) in the area under on the hair right behind/under her chin. But it's only a personal preference, since I'm obsessed with contrasts :D  Great work!"
ArtistLounge,3dpdks,puppy_time,2,Sat Jul 18 20:54:04 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I think your color suggestions are very good, I'm not very assertive with contrast and still have a lot to learn about light and shadow :)"
ArtistLounge,3dpdks,puppy_time,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:06:29 2015 UTC,"Glad to help!  For blurred edges with acrylic, you could either slowly dilute the paint with glaze or water as you work your way towards the edge of the bark to create like a gradient wash, or you could dry stipple.  Check this vid out:  She starts stippling around 6:30"
ArtistLounge,3dpdks,k0nundrum,2,Sun Jul 19 04:30:25 2015 UTC,"Critiques welcome, I already have a list of things I'd like to fix if I had more patience or a time machine, but a lot of you know a lot more than me so I'm sure there are other things to work on that I'm not seeing.

ArtistLounge,3dpdks,sgt_mary_mary,3,Sat Jul 18 04:19:17 2015 UTC,"I love it, great work!! My only critique is to soften the lines in the background. This will draw the eye in towards the subject and away from the less interesting/finished background"
ArtistLounge,3dpdks,FoxtrotOscar23,2,Sat Jul 18 06:36:37 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, you are completely right, I have it backwards with partly sketchy figure in front of detailed background.  I made myself work on the background first, and for a long time, because I hate painting trees so much I didn't want to phone it in at the end but it would have looked better that way.  Thank you :)"

ArtistLounge,3donga,ravensashes,3,Sat Jul 18 00:02:30 2015 UTC,"All the seeds, and the flesh of the pomegranate are the same color, so there's no gradual gradient across the fruit indicating depth. I found this reference picture, which shows the gradient on the meat of the fruit, like what I'm talking about. That's a pretty extreme example, and more impressionistic compared to what you're going for, but it can be a good reference guide. On the skull, you've formed many layers of shading, movements of color and light, but on the fruit, the shading is more flat, probably because you have smaller areas to work with, and that is more challenging.  Try googling ""Painting a pomegranate"" and looking at the image references to see how others have dealt with the issue, just so you can see options of how to approach it. It might give you insight. :D"
ArtistLounge,3donga,CuriosityK,3,Sat Jul 18 14:21:28 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'll give it a look. I've been working one seed at a time which is probably not the best idea.
ArtistLounge,3donga,waffleandbear,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:53:09 2015 UTC,"[preface: feel free to ignore!] firstly, this is seriously great.  One thing I noticed is that the skull is very dark, almost brown, while the teeth are still fairly white. I'm presuming this is down to the reference you were using? The dark colour fits the lighting conditions you've chosen but I still initially had my eyes drawn to the skull colour, so I wonder if lightening it a little might make it less of a feature?"

ArtistLounge,3dkqnq,PessimisticOptimist1,2,Fri Jul 17 01:41:37 2015 UTC,I also heard the same thing from those that switched from Wacom to Monoprice. Everyone that I know that owns one is pretty happy with it. I'd buy one myself too but I already have another cheap-o tablet that works and feels just as great as my old Wacom so by now I'm pretty open to the quality of cheap tablets.
ArtistLounge,3dkqnq,ghouli,2,Fri Jul 17 02:16:52 2015 UTC,"I had one for a couple years! It was a great tablet, would definitely recommend it. I also got it after having a bamboo for a while,and it was way better than it. Great size, worked just as well or better than the bamboo for half the cost. The only thing that bugged me is the pen took batteries, and sometimes would kind of come apart while I used it, but that might just have something to do with how I held it.  Only reason I stopped using it is because I upgraded to a cintiq!"
ArtistLounge,3dkqnq,sacari,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:42:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks, and congrats on the Cintiq!"
ArtistLounge,3dkqnq,thrshwlf,2,Fri Jul 17 04:44:36 2015 UTC,"I use a cintiq, but look up Ray frenden and check his blog / reviews. He highly recommends it as far as I know!"
ArtistLounge,3dkqnq,imagination_pulp,2,Fri Jul 17 09:18:16 2015 UTC,"I bought the 10x12in monoprice tablet 3 years ago for my first tablet, its still going strong and I'm completely happy with it! I would totally recommend this tablet if its your first. With monoprice drivers you can adjust the pressure sensitivity settings  The only thing I replaced was the pen when it finally gave out, which was around 2 months ago. My next upgrade will be to a cintiq :D"
ArtistLounge,3dkqnq,Varakkys,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:17:50 2015 UTC,"Hmmmm. I've got one. I've had huge problems with the drivers. I'm not even sure whether I have the official drivers, as far as I know they've not been updated since Windows 7. The ones that came with the hardware were completely out of date, and I've lost count of the number of different ones I've downloaded and tried. I can't remember exactly, because it's some time since I got it, but I remember spending hours installing and uninstalling driver sets to get the bloody thing working. I think I got the tablet responding quite quickly, but it took ages to get the sensitivity to work. And even now, it's pretty temperamental. Then every time I ran Windows update, it overwrote the drivers and I had to start all over again. As a result, I haven't dared do a Windows update in about a year.  So yeah, next time I buy a tablet it'll probably be a Wacom. The Monoprice is great when it works, but there's nothing more infuriating than sitting down for a drawing session and having to spend an hour or two dealing with technical codswallop instead.   TLDR: Drivers are an absolute pain in the arse if you're on Windows 8 (and from what I've read, it looks like Vista and 7 have the same issues)."
ArtistLounge,3di71d,Touch_Me_Gently,8,Thu Jul 16 13:57:18 2015 UTC,"When you draw hair, don't treat it like you need to draw each individual hair. Instead, draw the shape of the hair- usually this is like drawing ribbons, or a fabric of the hair is flatter. Focus on drawing sections of the hair just like you would a ribbon, paying attention to how it turns back on itself/curls. You really don't need to see individual hairs- rather, just shade the same direction as hair would grow with long strokes."

I'm a huge fan of this, and it actually looks sort of similar to my own style a bit. You captured my likeness very well...  I really, really admire how you've done the lips! I still really struggle with them myself. Thanks for the drawing btw :)"
ArtistLounge,3di71d,nyxinus,2,Thu Jul 16 15:42:38 2015 UTC,"Thats ok! Sorry for the late reply to the RGD, I did everything but the hair the day you posted it, and left it at that.   Thanks a lot, the main thing I go for is to get the drawing to look like the picture as much as possible - I'm not creative enough to do a funky style. No worries, I'm glad you liked it!"
ArtistLounge,3di71d,Dick_shoes,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:19:54 2015 UTC,"Great work capturing her features and expression! You started off well with the hair, but seem to focus more on individual strands than the volume of the hair. Try to focus on the hair as one mass, and then add some individual strands at the end to suggest the texture, if that makes sense?"
ArtistLounge,3dicfo,WallHop,2,Thu Jul 16 14:41:52 2015 UTC,"""Artists and creative people, they're the only group of people that I found, that wish they could never die.  Because they have so many ideas that they'll never be able to get through.""   One of my favorite quotes in a long time.  It's very true too, at least for me.  I always thought it was weird that I'm so interested in possibly immortality within my lifetime, compared to the rest of my friends.  He hit the nail on the head though, it's mostly because I have so many ideas and dreams I would live to see come to life.  I know I'm not the only one :)  and this makes me happy.    Awesome artist and interview, thank you for sharing!"

ArtistLounge,3dglf7,carterartist,2,Thu Jul 16 02:45:45 2015 UTC,"Well for looking for new art generally in all the threads, one way would be a combination of RedditEnhancementSuite and Reddit Gold. RES to look for red new comments notification on posts you've viewed. It shows something like ""60 comments (5 new)"" then go into the thread, hit the ""view images"" button and then scroll down looking for the Reddit Gold highlighted new comments that will show you if you've seen it before or not.  Other ways I use are mainly to follow specific artists. You can mark them as Friends (I think this is a Reddit Enhancement Suite feature) then there is a friends button up on the shortcut bar. Click that and you can see all the comments from your friends mixed together, you then have to scroll down until you see an imgur link. I've had trouble with the view images button on this feature. Sometimes it works sometimes it misses things and also there are a whole lot of unrelated comments.  Another thing to do is to follow artists on social media as they usually post their RGD art there too. Every so often there is a thread here on the lounge where people are asked to link to their social media. The latest one might have been 10 months ago. You can also search for hashtags like #redditgetsdrawn #reddit #redditartistnetwork #rgd   Doing a search for redditgetsdrawn on tumbler gets 23 posts since I posted mine yesterday around noon. On instagram 16 posts."
ArtistLounge,3dglf7,ObeyMyBrain,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:12:03 2015 UTC,"I have found a few of you, as you know, on other social sites ;)  As for the RES, I really need to go through its features. Thanks!!"
ArtistLounge,3dglf7,ItWillBeMine,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:44:35 2015 UTC,"You can use www.reddit.com/r/redditgetsdrawn/comments to see all of the newest comments in RGD, regardless of which thread they're in. It can be tedious opening each piece of art because there are so many, but it's a great way to spot people who go back and do art for an old thread, etc.  You can also follow RGD's instagram and FB accounts, as we post highlights from the sub most days.  Hope this helps! I like your enthusiasm for seeing RGD art! :)"
ArtistLounge,3dglf7,ObeyMyBrain,2,Thu Jul 16 16:16:10 2015 UTC,"The subreddit has helped me stay motivated to do more drawing, I have taken way too many breaks in my drawing and sufficing myself with just doodles. Since I found the subreddit last year I've seen my art get so much better that it feels like I've gotten better in the past year than the previous 38 before it where I thought I was a good artist ;)"

ArtistLounge,3dbhgl,k0nundrum,11,Tue Jul 14 23:55:08 2015 UTC,"I definitely prefer the first, where you can see the texture from the pencil. It gives it a more timeless feel, I think."
ArtistLounge,3dbhgl,poleis,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:57:47 2015 UTC,Thank you! I also like the pencil (and paper) texture coming through.
ArtistLounge,3dbhgl,appletreerobin,6,Wed Jul 15 06:21:22 2015 UTC,"I like the first one the best. For me the digital blending seems to have muddied up the contrast you had in some areas. I think I'm kind of hung up on her eyes, they aren't as clear in the second version."
ArtistLounge,3dbhgl,appletreerobin,2,Wed Jul 15 04:16:43 2015 UTC,"I could see that. When I went back and studied the drawing versus the original photograph, I realized that I had failed to render her eyes properly and tried to address that with the blending... but in the process, lost a lot of the detail."
ArtistLounge,3dbhgl,c_l_z,2,Wed Jul 15 06:22:32 2015 UTC,"Would you be able to post the original, to compare it with? I honestly think her eyes looked alright before the blending."
ArtistLounge,3dbhgl,ObeyMyBrain,2,Wed Jul 15 23:30:12 2015 UTC,"It was for this RGD, the daughter of fellow artist u/sleepytimevanilla.  In retrospect, I think part of the struggle was because I was having to guess at features that were masked by shadow, which made it much harder to get a good likeness."
ArtistLounge,3dbhgl,Madlutian,3,Thu Jul 16 01:45:25 2015 UTC,"Digital blending can make works look sloppy and unfinished because it removes refined edges. The first one is definitely better. If you're wanting to use digital blending, maybe attempt only using it sparingly to enchance."
ArtistLounge,3dbhgl,Cerulean_Shades,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:19:37 2015 UTC,Interesting. I was purposefully softening the edges because they looked too stark to me; that may be an issue with using a solid white background.
ArtistLounge,3dbhgl,coolsnail,4,Wed Jul 15 06:23:30 2015 UTC,"It's not just the outside edges but any edge. Such as between two different areas of tone. Like her chin line, hair, mouth, ear. If you just blend it smudges it and makes the whole image look blurry. You would have to go back in with a hardish brush to sharpen those edges back up. But then you start getting into the question of why you didn't just paint it completely digitally in the first place.   But the blending also removes the contrast edges you create with the darkest and lightest lines which also help to create a feeling of sharpness. The dark line on her chin is gone, the white and black lines in her teeth, there's some white under her lip that's been smoothed out, and especially her eyes, her eyes have lost their shine."
ArtistLounge,3dbhgl,bellevuefineart,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:57:34 2015 UTC,That makes a lot of sense. Thank you for elaborating.
ArtistLounge,3dbhgl,fluteitup,2,Wed Jul 15 16:27:35 2015 UTC,"I like both, but prefer the second one slightly more. I like the sheen of the digital cleanup."
ArtistLounge,3dbhgl,SirSoySauce,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:14:19 2015 UTC,"I also preferred the softness of light and shadow of the photoshopped version, which didn't translate well from the pencil on paper to the original digital copy."
ArtistLounge,3dbhgl,abraxart,2,Wed Jul 15 06:24:36 2015 UTC,"The top one has more feeling to it due to the texture. The bottom one feels like it lost a little something in translation, like you were second guessing yourself when you hit the right marks beautifully the first time."
ArtistLounge,3dbhgl,sigh-sigh,2,Wed Jul 15 03:42:41 2015 UTC,Thanks... that is exactly the kind of feedback I was looking for.
ArtistLounge,3dbhgl,sleepytimevanilla,2,Wed Jul 15 06:25:06 2015 UTC,"I prefer the first, but I'm also a fan of being able to see pencil strokes! :) imho, though, the second looks out of focus and...less refined than the first."
ArtistLounge,3dbhgl,sleepytimevanilla,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:43:11 2015 UTC,Thank you. It sounds like there is a general consensus that the pencil version is more interesting than the digital version.

ArtistLounge,3d3c5c,notastrugglingartist,2,Mon Jul 13 04:45:52 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/vholecek that the logistics just don't sound like they'd make sense.  I mean, yeah theoretically you could set something up like that, but I really doubt it would be ""a thing.""  The way I see your scenario is:  JoeSchmoe123 wants to see a high quality picture drawn by their favorite artist of a mechanical T-Rex fighting an army of evil snowmen.  JoeSchmoe123 lacks the artistic skill to make this art themselves.  JoeSchmoe123 also does not have the money to pay their favorite artist, ShmollyMiser, $1000 to create this piece.  They therefore post the drawing idea to the KrowdPainterz board in the hopes that people will fund this drawing idea.  JoeSchmoe123 puts down $20 toward this goal.  Here is where you'd basically be asking others to chip in on this awesome art idea.  One of the issues here is - someone else could post $25 to have them draw a Triceratops instead, or someone could drop $50 on your post and have them try to change it something else.  It sounds like the idea is more of a ""I want X art to exist in the world.""  However, it sounds pretty much exactly what a 1-on-1 commission relationship is for.  It would make more sense for you to borrow much from friends and just pay the artist the full amount.  For your idea to work you'd have to find X number of people wanting to see the same thing you do, and they'd have to want it enough to actually fork out money.  Having people fork out money for anything art-related is not an easy task, much less an idea that wasn't their own."
ArtistLounge,3d3c5c,follymiser,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:42:38 2015 UTC,"that doesn't seem like a very realistic model for commissions.  The more people you have throwing money in the pot, the more people that are going to want to have a say in the direction of the project...and who gets the finished product?  ...and why would anyone want to pitch in on a commission that's not for them?  A commission is, as much as anything else, about the one-on-one transaction of wants between the artist and client."
ArtistLounge,3d3c5c,vholecek,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:37:12 2015 UTC,"people agreeing on an idea   True, for huge projects, it would be too much of a cluster for people to agree on one specific thing.  But what if it's more simple? A lot of the pictures I've noticed that are requested will be like: ""N and M character doing X, Y, Z action in a D setting. Lineart only.""  A lot of professionals will charge for revisions as well, in my experience, so often times I've just given the artists a general idea of what I wanted and let them go it from there.   who gets the finished product   The internet. I mean, it seems like after one person pays $400 dollars to an artist to create something, that something immediately gets posted on said artist's portfolio, deviantart or some other website. Not all commissions are public, but the ones I've seen and paid money for have no incentive to not share it.   people pitching in a commission that's not for them   If all commissions were extremely specific and large in scope ( like a big project ) then everyone would have their own idea of a commission, and this model would be unrealistic. But I've seen a lot of commission ideas, that I would totally sink ten, twenty or thirty dollars into, especially if I saw that other people were putting money into it. Most of the times, they're simple, but sometimes someone can articulate a really cool, specific idea, that I would put money to anyhow.   Personally speaking, outside of trying to get more of the art I want commissioned, I want to see what other people are commissioning and then contribute to those ideas if it strikes my fancy."
ArtistLounge,3d3c5c,vholecek,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:52:37 2015 UTC,"I'm simply speaking from my own experience working commissions.  The buyer usually (not always, but usually) wants a physical product that they can have.  This may simply be because I work in physical media rather than digital, and as such there would be more emphasis placed on the original physical work and a crowd-funded commission model would not really be feasible."
ArtistLounge,3d3c5c,Madlutian,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:31:07 2015 UTC,"Ah, that is an interesting perspective. I didn't consider physical/non-digital art commissions.

I wish my lettering was as crisp as yours. Here's my most recent page and here's the rest As a matter of fact I remember your style from the last time I saw it.  Notes? The dialogue is absurdly generic! I don't know if there's going to be a shift in tone in the next page, but the speech from the general sounded like this:  ""Get out there and do war stuff! There's some kind of war or something.""  ""Between who and who?""  ""Who gives a shit. What am I, CNN? Now go defend the proud country of wherever the hell this is."""
ArtistLounge,3d1k6p,Devil_Nights,2,Mon Jul 13 03:27:08 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you like the style!

I was attempting to mimic the style of talk and drivle you would hear from a autocratic statesman, such as one of the Soviet leaders. Could you elaborate on how you think he should speak, so that I can change it accordingly in post? The tone as a whole will become more 'normal' during the conversation of the two friends.

ArtistLounge,3cw6go,k0nundrum,6,Sat Jul 11 07:43:41 2015 UTC,"No matter how much I wish and desire, I never dare to call myself an artist on a public forum for fear of being judged and laughed at by the real qualified professional artists, critics and the connoisseur art audience when they look at my pathetic skill level.  I might be called a delusional artist.   There is even a sub for that:  /r/delusionalartists  I have already resigned to my fate as a loser in art long time ago.  That's why I love RGD.  RGD gives me the chance to have a glimpse of that elusive dream where my sub par, amateurish, worthless artworks - rejected and derided by the hierarchically qualified art circle - could somehow be displayed with tolerance, judgement-free (alongside  professional artists works which I admire) and appreciated by some people, or even by just one person (the OP, the Mod or fellow art lover).   There is too much judgement, skepticism, stoicism  and elitist attitude in the ostentatiously dignified, self-important, self-inclusive art circles and some art communities nowadays that any dream and aspiration  a person has expressed may be labeled as ""delusional"".  My personal definition of an artist is :  If You love art, love creating art, if your artworks somehow bring joy and a smile to just only one person (even if that person is You). You are an artist.  (Some real qualified artist  in the real hierarchical art world may call my definition blasphemous, arrogant and delusional, but if I keep that definition as a secret to myself, how do they know)."
ArtistLounge,3cw6go,drawinglearner,3,Sat Jul 11 14:18:50 2015 UTC,"I like your personal definition of art, and also agree that, in a public forum, the judgemental ridiculousness makes it uncomfortable to claim that title."
ArtistLounge,3cw6go,drawinglearner,3,Sat Jul 11 18:09:08 2015 UTC,"Also, I just checked out that /r/delusionalartists sub, and it seems that much of what makes people judge them as delusional is when they ask for ostentatious amounts of money for either amateur art or art that strikes people as contrived or doesn't fit with their definition of ""art."" Though that assessment comes from my spending three minutes on the sub, so it may not be an accurate assumption."
ArtistLounge,3cw6go,drawinglearner,3,Sat Jul 11 19:45:28 2015 UTC,"There are posts where the supposed ""ridiculous"" artworks derided by the OP turned out to be well liked by some other commenters of the thread.   There are also caveats from the mod about the subjective judgement on the individual's definition of ""delusion"" or the issue of Redditors flooding the alleged delusional artists' products on Amazon with 1 star reviews...  Anyway, the existence of that sub alone has scared me to not ever call myself an artist on a public forum.  I never signed my works, never have any Tumblr, facebook Deviantart Account etc...I never dare to accept any commission, citing I am just a learner.  The only online presence of all my works are on RGD.  I hope that my username won't appear on that sub (delusionalartists) some day for some reason."
ArtistLounge,3cw6go,drawinglearner,3,Sat Jul 11 20:03:15 2015 UTC,"I agree that the presence of that sub is intimidating, but I think we can't let that kind of pettiness affect us. Just like those mean-spirited ""people of Walmart"" and similar shaming sites, one of the shadow sides of humanity is the tendency to point and laugh.   For me, it's almost a spiritual practice both to try to catch myself if I sink into doing the point-and-laugh behavior myself, and to also work to maintain my own sense of my own self enough not to let that tendency in others to derail me or restrict my life. Because if we let them, the judgments of others will constrain us and diminish us until we disappear, and that is a waste of this one precious lifetime.  When we create art, the most crucial question is whether it is meaningful for us -- either the process of creation, or the finished product, or both. It's just gravy if anyone else enjoys it or is touched by it, too, and if they aren't, that is just the electrochemical reaction of their own squishy grey matter, and doesn't need to affect us.   I think this path of self acceptance is slow, and a journey, but I do feel much less stymied and held back by my fear of criticism now than I used to, and I hope to someday feel free to do my own thing, regardless of the haters and their hate, hate, hate, hate, hate. ;)"

I remember, a while back, reading a comment in which you questioned your ability, and feeling amazed that someone with your level of talent doubted themselves. It may just be inevitable; art is so personal and vulnerable, and people have such different styles and different levels of proficiency with different techniques. It's hard not to compare ourselves to others, and put our focus on the areas where we could grow. I love seeing your art, and love the way you put subjects into other time periods."

ArtistLounge,3cw6go,sleepytimevanilla,3,Thu Jul 16 01:01:12 2015 UTC,"Is art: a rank (measuring ability)? A certain activity? An artifact (measuring quality)? An orientation (describing personal states)? Is it in the eye of the beholder? Does it depend on claims of artistry, or can it emerge naturally?  It's a homonym, AND It's non-linguistic."
ArtistLounge,3cw6go,sleepytimevanilla,2,Sat Jul 11 11:14:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, exactly. Perhaps the struggle comes from different uses of the same word. The non-linguistic aspect makes me think of the general inability humans have to truly comprehend the depth and intensity of other humans' subjective realities."
ArtistLounge,3cw6go,sleepytimevanilla,4,Sat Jul 11 19:21:47 2015 UTC,"What's important to my definition is a commitment to developing a process. It doesn't necessitate having an identifiable style, doing it your whole life, or even being good - but if you stick with it long enough, those things tend to develop; process and motivation are central to making that happen."
ArtistLounge,3cw6go,RyanSheldonArt,2,Sat Jul 11 13:00:15 2015 UTC,"That resonates for me; the commitment and passion, the engagement with learning and experimenting and actively creating art, on a daily basis, regardless of the particular output."
ArtistLounge,3cw6go,RyanSheldonArt,3,Sat Jul 11 19:23:36 2015 UTC,"Thinking about it again, a more succinct word in all its meanings  might be discipline."
ArtistLounge,3cw6go,isaack1101,2,Sat Jul 11 23:03:15 2015 UTC,"I think ""discipline"" is a part of it, but passion is another part, and is equally important. I could practice piano for two hours every day for years and show amazing discipline, but if I had no passion, I would not be creating music that would be enjoyable for an audience. I think the same goes for art.   I don't think we have to be passionate every minute... sometimes picking up the pencil brings out my whiny inner child, ""but I don't wanna draw right now!!!"" But the underlying joy and passion for creating needs to be present, along with the discipline to actually create. And everyone on this site clearly has a passion for it, or we wouldn't be spending our free time making art."
ArtistLounge,3cw6go,BevvieIsOnFire,4,Sun Jul 12 04:39:21 2015 UTC,"Completely agree with this sentiment. I liken it to other things you do for fun but not professionally. I would say I ride my bike for fun, but I wouldn't call myself a cyclist. I play the piano, but I'm not a pianist. I blacksmith, but I'm not a blacksmith. I swim, but I'm not a swimmer."
ArtistLounge,3cw6go,AGamerDraws,2,Sat Jul 11 14:00:50 2015 UTC,"That's true, to some extent. Though for sports, I would say my brother and father are cyclists, in that it is a central hobby for them, and my husband is a swimmer, as he loves to swim and has done it extensively since he was a boy. It doesn't have the same implication that the person needs to be earning money from it in order to claim the title.   The same holds for crafts; I comfortably call myself a knitter, for example. But for more ""serious"" artistic endeavors, though, there seems to be a higher bar. Even though I wrote poetry for years, I never felt comfortable calling myself a ""poet,"" or a ""writer."" It took me years of singing in groups, arranging my own music, and making recordings before I felt reasonably comfortable calling myself a ""singer,"" and even now I feel it needs caveats. And ""artist"" feels like it has an even higher bar.   I wonder how much of the discomfort has to do with the intensely personal nature of art, so people feel more vulnerable about claiming the title, and more prone to judgement about others claiming the title?"
ArtistLounge,3cw6go,Norma5tacy,5,Sat Jul 11 19:30:11 2015 UTC,"I don't and probably won't ever. I find it very uncomfortable to throw that word around when refering to myself. The concept of an ""artist"" is too vague and I think there's a lot of stigma atached to the word (be it modern artists who try to ""make a statement"" and look like pompous d-bags or the clear line of mental instability in the old masters). If somebody else wants to call me an artist, by all means, go right ahead, I just don't think I'll ever use the word about myself. Much like yourself I just draw for fun and--squirrel!"
ArtistLounge,3cw6go,Madlutian,2,Sat Jul 11 14:11:29 2015 UTC,"It's interesting how much the term ""artist"" does carry stereotypes in the name, though I wonder if it's more than ""lawyer"" or ""mechanic""... or ""stripper.""  I love the quote by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie   “The single story creates stereotypes, and the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue, but that they are incomplete. They make one story become the only story.”"
ArtistLounge,3cw6go,Madlutian,4,Sat Jul 11 19:41:25 2015 UTC,"The word artist has so much baggage for me.  I don't think I could use it till I was making the majority of my income with art.  And even then I'd worry that all the art geniuses would look at what I did and snort derisively so I'd probably say ""well I do illustrations but sometimes I paint people"" because that sounds safer and explains what I do without saying that I am anything.    I feel like if I say I'm an artist that people think I'm saying I think I'm Leonardo da Vinci and will look at what I produce and think I'm a delusional idiot.  Which is stupid, I don't think people laugh at someone for being a software engineer but not being Bill Gates.  Most people are not as good as the top in their field and noooobody cares at a dinner party.  Logically, I think if you make art you're an artist.  If I was a bird watcher or a hula hooper or a mountain biker as a hobbyist I could say that.   Because I think that doesn't invite the same kind of comparison.    So to me you can call yourself an artist, really, if you're regularly producing art and trying to improve, and can come to terms with the word.  Meanwhile I'll be over here explaining how sometimes I make marks on paper with things when someone asks me what I do for fun. Because I think it's just a word you either embrace or not and it really is ok to get comfortable with it and say ""yeah, I have fun with art, I'm an artist."". I just doubt I ever will myself.

ArtistLounge,3cu4qt,jackjohnbrown,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:35:56 2015 UTC,"Domain name front running:       Domain name front running is the practice whereby a domain name registrar uses insider information to register domains for the purpose of re-selling them or earning revenue via ads placed on the domain's landing page. By registering the domains, the registrar locks out other potential registrars from selling the domain to a customer. The registrar typically takes advantage of the 5-day ""domain tasting"" trial period, where the domain can be locked without payment.  The term was created by domain investor and retired stockbroker Daniel Stager who likened the practice to front running, when a stockbroker illegally puts their own financial interests above that of their clients. ICANN has since picked up on the term.   In January 2008, it was reported that Network Solutions uses data collected from their web-based WHOIS search to register every domain that users check for availability.  Although the practice forces users to register the searched-for domains from Network Solutions, Network Solutions defends the practice, claiming that ""This protection measure provides our customers the opportunity to register domains they have previously searched without the fear that the name will be already taken through Front Running.""  However, during the 4-day period, the domain is still up for sale to the general public solely through Network Solutions and is not, in fact, reserved for a specific person at all.

ArtistLounge,3cu958,Dmunman,2,Sat Jul 11 01:27:28 2015 UTC,"Pretty much agreed. If you choose to do work for free, you gotta realize that you're not automatically entitled to their thanks. Yes, grattitude is nice but you can't force someone to appreciate or like your work no matter how skilled you are. And by virtue of unpaid art, some people may just be out there to take advantage of you. So make sure you're getting something out of it first."

That said, only one of my RGDs hasn't thanked me,  generally people are pretty grateful and that's with my newbie quality ones haha.   I'd say keep going, but don't EXPECT the thank you, take it as a bonus. Otherwise you set yourself up to be disappointed by the occasional ungrateful OP"

ArtistLounge,3cu958,ItWillBeMine,3,Fri Jul 10 23:51:19 2015 UTC,"It does bother me. Two that I immediately think of were ones that I was really happy with and proud of, that I thought the OP would love, but neither responded. One of those OP's responded to other art in the thread, also (but I think I posted a couple days later....and I also remember looking at the OP's page and seeing that he had been active since my reply)  Anyway, yeah, it does suck a lot but I go into RGD knowing I might get no reply. It's just a possibility that comes with the forum.   Actually, it sucked the most when a bunch of artists (myself included) replied to a post which the mods then deleted for OP breaking rules. I support the rules but I didn't like that the post got deleted because now none of our art could be seen by others at all. (that was another piece I was proud of, too)"
ArtistLounge,3cu958,coolsnail,-14,Sat Jul 11 01:44:16 2015 UTC,"Which post was that? We do remove posts that break rules, however, we put them back up if artists are upset about it or complain."

I'm all for enforcing the rules but when 4 people have already posted art, I think it might be too late to delete the post? Like, if nobody had replied then it's fine, but that's 4 pieces of art people put time into that will now be never seen. (Idk how it works, but I'm under the impression that nobody could see that post anymore once it was deleted?)  Is there another solution for this? Leaving the post up because of art but telling the OP that they're banned  from then on?"
ArtistLounge,3cu958,termhn,-14,Sat Jul 11 01:35:39 2015 UTC,"Ahh, I'm glad I'm consistent (I see that I offered to make the post visible again and you never responded).  We always remove rule-breaking posts, period. And we always put them back up if an artist requests it, period.   This does not happen often. That is because we frequently check a script that tells us which posts are rulebreaking. In this particular case, all of the mods had been away at the same time, leaving a rule-breaking post up for longer than usual. Some artists don't care, and some have actively asked us to leave a post down if it's rulebreaking. That's why we stick with the standard of just putting it back up if we're asked to."

I mean I'm sure most of us artists were better than others in Kindergarten, but drawing is not something someone can be naturally gifted at. If I wanted to just practise I would draw a celebrity instead. Since discovering RGD I found out that art is something that can make others happy. Without a thank you I feel like I have not fulfilled my duty and failed as an artist."

After that I would be drawing all the time. While who is to say if certain skills or physical traits can be passed on to next generation, I do know that a I would draw in school at home, during class, after class. I would finish a test just so I could draw but unlike you I stopped when I was 11. Family kept telling me I wouldn't be financially stable as an artist...at 11 to have your parents crush your dreams sucks. I wouldn't pick it up again until I was 16. So much time had passed that all I did was utter crap. Within a few months I was doing ok I suppose. Still, I ventured to different things while in high school. I learn to play the clarinet and join band. I got into the multimedia academy and so on. Came college time and I was double majoring in Electrical Engineering and Art. I am sure I don't have to tell you but Art is very time consuming...more than any of my engineering counterparts realized. Trying to balance the two was really hard for me as both majors required a lot of blood, sweat, and tears so I made a choice. I became an Electrical Engineer. Most people fail to see how art and math go together. In many ways, Art is math...math is art...anyway, I went to grad school and now I've been an engineer for 2 years. Now that I am done with schooling, I picked up a pencil again. So after a long hiatus, I started drawing again this year. Started with a pencil and moved on to a wacom tablet. Some times I only get three hours of sleep. I come home from work, work out, eat, and start drawing. Time just flies by. I wish I could say I am a complete artistic badass but I am not. I am just picking up where I left off. My devian page is D4Aries :D"

I took some art classes which was really fun, and taught me more about various styles and just painting in general. Once I got my hands on a tablet, I found I really enjoyed using the same methods I use painting on it. I feel like I improve loads for each drawing I do, and that's really fun to see.  But lately I've been in a rut artwise, so I haven't really been drawing at all. I don't really have much art to show, but some of it is up on my tumblr."

ArtistLounge,3crlqm,Madlutian,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:11:40 2015 UTC,"I can't remember when I started drawing, my childhood exists in kind of a fog, the further back I go in my mind, the thicker the pea soup gets. So, let's just say, I remember always drawing. I used to sketch (pencil and pen) all day, and dabbled in watercolor and acrylic. But, sketching and shading were always my forte. I got into D&D and used to draw everyone's characters. I kept trying to reinvent my style. I went through Anime, tracing, cartooning, cubism, surrealism, only negative space, minimalism, etc. I'm still playing around with minimalism a lot. I got into web design in the early to mid 90's, which introduced me to digital art. I started off with Paint Shop Pro and then started messing around with PhotoShop. It took me a really long time to understand what was possible with blending, transparencies and layering altogether. I never feel like I'll stop learning and tend to get addicted to one particular tool for a while.   I went to school for multimedia, and spent a lot of time editing videos and getting more and more into Graphic Design. I worked in the game industry for about 2 years and learned from the digital artists, concept artists, and 3D modelers at Bioware while being a QA Engineer. Then, I moved to Iowa and got a job as a Graphic Artist for a beer distributor. It's a lot of template work, and very little actual creativity. But, print jobs take a while, and in the interim, I sometimes have time to sketch for RGD and for myself. That's my only real creative outlet for the most part. I've lost a lot of practice on sketching, but I've gotten pretty good at digital artwork over time. I still love creating. And, it's nice to have a paid job as an artist, even if the art part of the job is somewhat minimal.   My stuff is all over the place, but I tend to use instagram as a bit of an art dump. My user name is Madlutian."
ArtistLounge,3cq6qi,Good-Pizza,4,Thu Jul 9 22:01:08 2015 UTC,"I definitely know the feeling. I get into ruts where I am just dissatisfied with whatever gets put on paper. There wasn't a whole lot that I felt I could do about it, since no matter what I did, it didn't seem ""good"".  I realized that my attitude was what needed to change. I had a sketchbook where my goal was to put something worth looking at on every page. After months of drawing, I had surprisingly little. At that point I realized that I was searching for a destination without wanting the journey.  I know everyone's path with be different from mine, but the big realization for me was that every time I put pen to paper, I was constantly judging it as good or bad. There was no ""practice"", only a bunch of pass/fail tests that I was always failing.   So whenever I get in that mood or funk, I practice. I do quick figure studies or color studies or just draw boxes. But whatever I do, it won't be something good or bad. It's just practice. That attitude has helped me sketch more productively, and lose a bit of the anxiety surrounding my art. I'm by no means perfect, and I still have a lot of off days, but it gets a whole lot easy when I'm aware of the critic in my head hard at work."

ArtistLounge,3cq6qi,Dmunman,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:03:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, absolutely! Learning how to turn off ""the critic"" voice can be tricky. I find that drawing for 5-10 minutes at least (blind contour, quick figure sketches, whatever) helps shift my mind back into a more creative mode and once there, it's easier to ignore the critical thoughts and focus on the task at hand.  Don't be afraid to use your critical thoughts too. They may not be helpful when starting a piece, but don't shy away from examining old work and looking for areas to improve. If some area really disappoints you, try to figure out why. Maybe do a quick sketch or study of that section to learn how you can improve. I find that keeps me focussed on the process rather than always on a ""perfect"" result."

My job is all numbers so when I started drawing again this year it was really easy to fall back into creating characters working on ""my unique style"" until I realized it was just all an excuse for not being able to do anything else. So i started drawing stuff out of my comfort zone and all god was it hard (still is). I would  just throw it away because I thought it looked bad. I eventually finished a sketchbook. Looking back at it, I see that I was stressing out over it. I would be at work all pissed off because I couldn't draw something I wanted to, and like I said my profession has nothing to do with art. I look at my sketches and I smile because I see all the things I still need to do to improve but now I just tackle them one at a time."
ArtistLounge,3cq6qi,lew01f,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:40:07 2015 UTC,"A professor once told me that when you start feeling really dissatisfied with your work, it means you're progressing. It just takes a bit of time for your hand to catch up with your head.  Off course we all feel this way from time to time (or in my case a little bit all the time), but I really think it's a good thing. It's what keeps us from stagnating.  That said, try to see the big picture. In the course of your artistic career you will go through so many phases and advance so much, this period is just a drop in the ocean.   When you come across something you feel you're not doing well enough, do it a lot. All the time. Try to figure out what you're doing wrong, experiment with anything that comes to mind and just do it, no matter how bad it is at first. The more you work at it, the sooner you'll get good at it, but you will get good at it. The only way to really fail is to quit."
ArtistLounge,3cqg2d,NMDraw,3,Thu Jul 9 23:14:46 2015 UTC,"There's definitely a likeness, I think you just need to practice getting smoother gradations in your shading, and observing shapes and angles more accurately.  Here's a great tutorial on sharpening your observation skills. It's all in comparing the positions of different body parts in relation to each other. Glancing quickly between your reference and drawing will help you a lot.  For example, I think the eyes are actually rounder and less wide than your drawing shows (observe the shape of her eye whites in the photo and compare them to your drawing). Her jawline and chin are also more angular and slightly more pointed. I also think her nostrils should be higher up and closer to her eyes as well.  When it comes to hair, don't be afraid to just block things into areas of dark and light, and don't worry about adding every little strand that you see.   Here are a few examples:  Norman Rockwell 1  Bradshaw Crandell  J.C. Leyendecker 1  J.C. Leyendecker 2  Hope this helps!"
ArtistLounge,3cqg2d,PrellFeris,2,Fri Jul 10 02:38:41 2015 UTC,"the best thing you can do is just make a SHITLOAD of art! do as many portraits as you can and keep making stuff!   i know this isn't the answer you want, but that's the best way.....i've been making art for over 25 years and it wasn't until about eight years ago that i started being able to make it look like the person.   so just make a bunch! try and make it an everyday habit and you will gradually get better over time :) hope this helps!"
ArtistLounge,3cqg2d,RyanSheldonArt,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:28:31 2015 UTC,"You're doing well, but one thing that's important that would really improve your ability to draw is controlling your line weight."
ArtistLounge,3cqg2d,SoraXes,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:18:51 2015 UTC,"my friends get pretty pissed at me when they see my initial sketches because i just have lines everywhere. I actually submitted a drawing on that RGD as well and what I currently have looks nothing like what I started with. I plan a lot of it out. I use light lines and shapes. I even use light circles and stuff to figure out where I want to put the shadows and as I go i just make it all disappear. It became even easier when I moved digital two months ago, sadly I get stressed out drawing on paper now because I am afraid of messing up lol. I would say, plan it out more. Use different pencil to lightly set your foundation. Once you have what you want start detailing with your 4hb. Easier said than done, but I practice and fuck up all the time as well. Ryan said it best, ""just make a shitload of art!"". That's what I've been doing and the improvement is incredible. I also take breaks. Like not draw for a day. Sometimes you need to unwind you know. I don't draw every day. I need my sleep, like I said I am not a professional artist and have a different day job"
ArtistLounge,3cqg2d,lew01f,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:48:12 2015 UTC,"I knew which photo it was just by the time the eyes loaded on your drawing so you are clearly not giving yourself enough credit. The main thing (which I'm sure you've heard a ton before) is to draw what you see not what you know is there. Here are the main things I have to constantly remind myself: Is there really a shadow on that part of the face? Are there highlights that are being overlooked? What shape are the eyes ACTUALLY (I tend to get lazy about this one and just draw ""eye shaped eyes"" which is stupid and wrong)? Also, don't be afraid to go dark. When I was using pencil with my drawing I would always leave the shadows too light and not have enough contrast and the whole thing would look washed out and flat.  And of course, get out there and make a ton of bad art in the name of making good art.  Really mess it up something terrible.  Fill out a shadow until you have nothing but a black piece of paper in front of you...ok, maybe pull back a little from that, but you know what I mean.  That way you know what not to do next time and you'll make progress.  Keep at it because it only gets better the more you allow yourself to be ok with not everything being great!"

ArtistLounge,3cmi6g,myhandisapencil,11,Thu Jul 9 01:41:12 2015 UTC,"I got some bad news for ya. You're already an actual artist. And to make it worse, you're already challenging yourself emotionally. That's why you feel the way you do right now. Sucks right? The stress of art is always way less glamorous than we want it to be. It's a nagging stress, like staring at that lawn and knowing it's time to roll out the mower.  The struggle with observational and representational art is that constant nagging feeling that you're not making it interesting. That there is a little voice in the back of your head asking if the piece is personal, if it has a statement. Your identity is in every choice you make with that pencil when your drawing. It's the object you chose to draw. It's how you felt that object would best be represented. Drawings like this are the cornerstone of art. Every artist has approached them at some point in their career. These drawings have withstood the test of time for thousands of years. You are a part of art history with these drawings.  Take /u/seanmillsartist's advice and just keep moving forward. The more you draw and explore the more you will find the gaps in the art world you'll want to bridge. Every basic skill you practice becomes a tool and you're going to need tools to build those bridges. In the meantime, focus less on finding answers to ""why should I make this piece?"" and more on answering ""how should I make this piece?"""

ArtistLounge,3cmi6g,Wikkitikki,2,Thu Jul 9 20:55:33 2015 UTC,"I would say that if you want to start branching out, revisit one of your older works to inspire a new work, where now that you've done the observation, you can now explore adding a flavor to it that you can call your own.   Good luck and I look forward to seeing what you come up with soon."
ArtistLounge,3cmi6g,seanmillsartist,2,Thu Jul 9 01:56:08 2015 UTC,"Artistic identity can come from both the formal qualities and the conceptual qualities, but first of all you shouldn't be scared. Improving your knowledge and technical skills is the hard part, the identity finds itself.  Even if you just did ""observational drawings"" your niche and identity could come from what you point your personal lens at. The Ashcan school of painters started painting the industrialized world around them rather than tradtional motifs.   Stylistically, you can still gain a lot of simply copying masters both classic and contemporary. The more techniques you study the more you'll notice what you like to do, and what you are good at doing.   Finally, don't be precious about what your ""personal"" art is. Just make art. You don't have to show the stuff that turns out bad, but just keep making stuff."

Front row L to R: 1- Dunno 2- Dunno 3- The lovely Sarah 4- Furniture (is that poison or  absinthe?) 5- Dunno 6- IWBM again? 7- Dunno 8- Dunno 9- Dunno   Not a very good score by any means, somebody please fill in the blanks :D"

U/FoxtrotOscar23 has drunk more than enough to get over the imagined judgey eyes everywhere, glances over at /u/JetDog, surrounded by admirers, laughing heartily at his every utterance... 'I can be cool like that' he thinks, sidling up to an attractive lady at the bar. Not much forehead, but plenty of chest. Breaking out one of his smoothest lines he begins,'Nice ti- ' the music stops, the needle scratching the record and  around the room 6 pairs of eyes lock on to him with laserlike focus and disapproval.

At the same time, /u/Pydkou is going through the queue forming behing them, searching the would-be guests for hidden drugs and other forbidden objects.   Inside, /u/jackjohnbrown and /u/sleepytimevanilla are performing CPR on the unknown and unconscious guest on the floor. Meanwhile /u/Inspector_Santini is piecing together the evidence to find the culprit, with help from her assistant, /u/sgt_mary_mary.   /u/who-died shows /u/chokeberry a funny vine, while /u/yowtfyo pauses the music to go on youtube and find a clip of that great goal  from that soccer game that was on the other night. At the same time, /u/adillac sends a text informing everyone that she's on her way and will hopefully be arriving very soon. Maybe.  /u/metabaron explains the importance of addressing nobility with proper titles to a group of guests, but is constantly interrupted by /u/JetDog who wants to find buyers for his patented JetDog Squint-o-Vision® glasses. Though they find his pitch to be very amusing indeed, he is unsuccessful, and moves on to another group.  And in the back of the room, /u/heyryaaan cleans his fur, observing."
ArtistLounge,3ci47o,sgt_mary_mary,5,Wed Jul 8 16:12:05 2015 UTC,"Haha, loved the ""performing CPR on the unknown and unconscious guest on the floor"" - does chokeberry become the prime suspect once who-died pronounces the guest officially dead and the cause of death is determined to be asphyxiation?   I'd probably be politely escorted out the door by IWBM even before the guests start arriving for unwittingly breaking some unwritten party rule. ""No, you can't talk to people the entire time using only snippets from obscure 60's and 70's rock songs."" edit: a word."

ArtistLounge,3ci47o,sgt_mary_mary,4,Wed Jul 8 21:03:52 2015 UTC,"I most certainly do, thank you very much. Unless you don't think yelling at servants all day is an actual job.  Not to mention the fact that I also have to take care of my father who is himself a Duke and a relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery.  He is a great womanizer, a heavy drinker, and will often make outrageous claims like he invented the question mark. Sometimes he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy, the sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament. And despite being a doctor he can also be pure Evil, it's all very exasperating, really."
ArtistLounge,3ci47o,adillac,3,Fri Jul 10 08:03:41 2015 UTC,"Oh dear, that does sound like hard work! Perhaps the rest of us should be more grateful for our uncomplicated,  proletarian lives."

ArtistLounge,3ci47o,sgt_mary_mary,10,Thu Jul 9 06:36:46 2015 UTC,"The place is packed with familiar faces. Jazz is pouring out of a record player in one corner, where a group of tattooed guys are softly stroking their man buns to the smooth tunes of Miles Davis. In the other corner, a pair of iPhone speakers are blasting jpop and babymetal into the big ears of the manga artists.  Back by the entrance there's an argument. Some guy didn't pass the background check and is being thrown out by security. He keeps yelling threats through the mail slot until the police shows up to confine him to the shadow world, where he will forever wonder the empty streets looking for fat people to hate.   Down in the basement, a stranger wearing Groucho glasses is trying to expose the cheating tracers. An in-depth powerpoint presentation is scheduled for later.   Loud noises are coming out of the kitchen. Apparently a guy wearing a beret had an allergic reaction to the Cintiq and everybody's freaking out.   A sock is hanging off the knob to the locked bedroom. And we all know what that means. Yeah, that's right. A podcast in session.   And then, at the far end of the couch, is /u/megaswan quietly lounging by himself. He likes these people, but he haven't seen anybody in a while and it's a bit awkward. Someone waves and /u/megaswan is eager to return it, only to find it was meant for someone behind him. He quickly lowers his hand to his hair and starts stroking it while nodding along to Miles Davis."
ArtistLounge,3ci47o,adillac,11,Wed Jul 8 17:55:12 2015 UTC,"I would be totally stoked. So stoked I would wear my party slacks, the ones that make a vooping sound when I move. Ooooh yeah, you know when jetdog is coming 'round. VOOP VOOP, here he comes now.  Allow me to set the scene for you.  /u/who-died hangs from a chandelier with a massive bottle of Courvoisier in one hand. /u/jastyoot crafts 74 amazing portraits of her until the chandelier smashes to the ground. Before anyone can panic, /u/Onomaya collects all the pieces and assembles them into a fully functional cognac dispenser. /u/Who-died is first to drink. Applause.  /u/drawinglearner shows up in a full bodiced gown. My slacks suddenly seem less enchanting. I make a note to investigate full-bodiced gown shops in the near future.  /u/foxtrotoscar23 whips out his .50 cal rifle and shoots a stippled drawing of boobs into the wall. The spent shells magically assemble themselves into a beautiful brass tree on the floor. In a fit of jealousy I use my renowned origami skills to create a moist ball of paper.  /u/chokeberry is surrounded by lizards that do her bidding, and, strangely, she uses them for good instead of evil.  /u/pydkou stands inscrutable in the corner in spite of my best scrutulation. I assume s/he is drunk but I'm far too drunk to trust my own judgment.  /u/fivepmsomewhere stands nearby, cracking her knuckles menacingly. By carefully observing the 12 empty bottles nearby I cleverly deduce that she's drunk off her keester.  /u/sgt_mary_mary also drunk but Swedish so it is cancelled out.  /u/heyryaaan is drunker than most and flexing art-muscle. We all swoon. I'm glad I brought my folding fan in case I get the vapours.  /u/k0nundrum is even drunker than /u/heyryaaan, yet is able to create a magnificent origami crane using box-tops. Someone in the room is heard to shout ""Oh FACKSAKES!"".  Ahem.  Someone. Yes. Someone.  /u/the-tinidril prances on the dessert table with her hobbit feetses. The ghost of Tolkien shows up and nods in approval. My inner fanboy squeals in delight in spite of the clear violation of food safety.  /u/metabaron, having brought a shitton of LPs, is convincing the DJ to play them in some particular order, saying something to the effect of ""If you play Dark Side BACKWARDS while simultaneously playing Sticky Fingers FORWARDS with Hunky Dory in the background at 45 RPM you can HEAR THROUGH TIME, man"".   /u/ItWillBeMine is busy fretting over everyone's well-being. At some point she exits with /u/Dmunman and /u/metabaron in tow. They all return 20 minutes later looking 87% more Wavy Gravy and spend the rest of the night at the dessert table eating around /u/the-tinidril's toes.  And little ol' me? Oh I'm causing no ruckus, eliciting no unsolicited urinary discharge. I'm alone on the dance floor, using my patented storklike manoevres to navigate /u/metabaron's track choices and hear my way right into 2112.  VOOP VOOP, my friends, VOOP VOOP indeed."

Or hey, very close - the series is about that bridge.. :D (and a bit of Scandinavian background info: before the bridge was built, Copenhagen would be overrun every weekend by Swedes taking the ferry from Malmö, because booze was cheaper in DK that in SE, and even cheaper still on the ferry. If you met a group of very loud, very drunk disorderlies, you could be 100% sure it was a swedish weekend party. ;) As if the Danes didn't get drunk enough! xD Since the bridge, the trip seems less alluring... Also, people have gotten so %*$# healthy and goodygoody these days. The days of drunk weekend Swedes are over... ;) ) °switches out of Wiki mode° Now where's that belgian beer?!"
ArtistLounge,3ci47o,JetDog,2,Fri Jul 10 06:11:36 2015 UTC,It must be comforting to know that the the tradition of drunk weekend Swedes is alive and well on the Baltic sea. Nothing like that duty free Finnish vodka <3

(heyryaaan is basically ron swanson in my head......) his pace and glorious head of hair is inspiring to the whole crowd.  the whole crowd mingles inside, with every third person drinking something bizarre, like absinthe with a shot of cough syrup in a man's hat. a startling number of guests obtain free drinks then walk away without even making eye contact and actively telling people they bought the drink themselves.   still, a jovial atmosphere prevails, and three girls buy me drinks while i chat on about the pitfalls of 1980's cartoons, oblivious to their attention."

ArtistLounge,3ci47o,Dmunman,2,Wed Jul 8 03:45:20 2015 UTC,Never. Never ever.
ArtistLounge,3ci47o,ArtFriend,-1,Wed Jul 8 13:03:18 2015 UTC,":'(  It's not because we don't love your work. It's a product of being a strange coincidence plus the sheer number of pieces submitted each week. I did the math on it once and when we pick 30 pieces each week, we are only picking between two and five percent of the art that was submitted. However, I could have sworn I picked you in the past at least once, so I'm really surprised!"
ArtistLounge,3ci47o,JetDog,2,Wed Jul 8 13:10:59 2015 UTC,"Oh it's okay, I know how swamped you guys are with things. I just remember seeing the end of the year posts for 2014 and realizing I hadn't been chosen ever and feeling sort of bummed, so I haven't been back in a bit. Not that I don't love you guys, I have just been swamped with poster and newspaper work and haven't had the time to do anything else recently."
ArtistLounge,3ci47o,adillac,0,Wed Jul 8 13:26:19 2015 UTC,"I'm really sorry to hear that. I'm sure you're not the only one who has felt this way (in fact I know you're not - we have actually heard angry complaints before from artists who hadn't been chosen). I wish there was more we could do. It's such a small number of spaces for such a large body of art every week that wonderful, stellar, beautiful pieces are not featured every week. We actually opened an Instagram account to start recognizing more pieces each week. It's not quite the same, but it helps. I always hate to hear that the awards are any source of sadness or distress. Maybe this is a good topic for SOTU. If lots of artists are feeling stressed out about it, I'd rather not do them."
ArtistLounge,3ci47o,sgt_mary_mary,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:36:51 2015 UTC,"I mean, I wouldn't say I was sad or distressed or angry, just a little like ""c'mon really?"". Submitting regularly for a year with no recognition just got a little like ""what's the point?"". It just happened to also coincide with my personal career starting to take off, so I didn't find it as necessary to visit regularly, especially because I could disappear without anyone noticing.   I think it could be a good topic for SOTU, but I don't think the right answer is out there. I mean, there are so many incredible artists, so handing out awards like candy would just make them not mean as much, you know? I feel like it's just one of those things."
ArtistLounge,3ci47o,megaswan,-5,Sat Jul 11 01:11:50 2015 UTC,"Well, to be fair, there was some recognition. Praises, compliments, upvotes, and gratitude...plus I remember you feeling grateful that I included you in this post, right? I feel like I remember you saying that you got some good attention and possibly commissions out of that, but I could be wrong. The majority of artists were certainly left out of that post, and I got some heat from excluded artists about that. It is true that we really can't please everyone. But what I'm hearing is that the specific recognition of the awards would have been nice. And I totally get that. It certainly isn't a perfect system. We leave excellent art out every week, just due to the sheer number. And it sucks. :(    especially because I could disappear without anyone noticing.   To be completely honest, I notice every single artist's comings and goings. Your absence was noticed and I thought about you, just like I think about danjoblues, artector, jenpenjen, monster_puppy, and many others who used to be around and now are not (or at least not as much as they used to be). But, I am always sad to hear when an artist leaves due to things that are somewhat preventable, such as recognition."

You're right, there were a lot of positive thing, and you are exceptional as a mod, and a person, and I don't doubt for an instant that you did notice. My ""leaving"" RGD was more of a gradual frustration than a rage induced quit. I got loads of positive feedback on everything I did, which is what made it that much more frustrating that I never made it into the elusive awards and got the stupid flair by my name. It was a weekly ""God damnit!"" and then I'd feel a little less motivated as the weeks went on. It's nothing you guys did wrong, just luck of the draw. I know I'm not alone in this, and please don't feel bad about it, you guys did nothing wrong  at all, it's just a petty ego thing :)"
ArtistLounge,3ci47o,megaswan,-3,Sat Jul 11 01:42:08 2015 UTC,"I totally get it. If I was working hard at something every week for a year and didn't get recognized, I'd be frustrated too.

I go around, gently (?) scolding people for not using coasters and leaving trash on the floor. I get a lot of side-long glances, some of which seem friendly, some curious, some menacing. I return them all levelly.  I make the mistake of asking funisher a question about art and miss the next 30 minutes' worth of rule-enforcing while he regales me with history, theory, context, examples, and current trends in the field. :D  A group fight breaks out amongst freehanders vs. tracers that I have to break up, mostly by using my pointy elbows and sharp tongue, since I am tall but wee in stature. The other modfolk help by biting ankles, performing full nelsons, and other sophisticated, ninja-type moves.  A rival gang says they're going to start their own party outside, but their party is lame and consists of three to four angry people, just standing around.  There is a surprisingly high number of attractive females in this room, but since you can't make comments on appearance, I just stare a little bit, resulting in more side-long stares.  My other fan club arrives and eggs the house, but I am cheered up afterwards by the positive attitudes of who-died, adillac, doomedjanissary, and batmansbff. It was mostly just the mess of it that bothered me anyway.  I follow sgt_mary_mary around for a while, just to hear her cool accent. Then I do the same thing to Pydkou. Then I do the same thing to Glynrick.  Fivepm ends the party by telling us it's time to go to bed."

ArtistLounge,3caf52,adillac,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:33:10 2015 UTC,"Hah - like me, then. xD  Did you find a lot of difference in your approach to drawing, after all that time? I find I generally worry an awful lot more about my drawing than I used to, funnily enough. About my lack of technical ability, I mean. Maybe worrying is just a generic part of getting older. ;) BTW, I had never come across your red drawings - they're fantastic. Pretty unusual for digital artists to use these muted, organic colours - but it works a treat! :D"
ArtistLounge,3caf52,carterartist,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:03:47 2015 UTC,"My approach is different, for sure, mainly in that it's a lot less inhibited due to working digitally. Where I used to be really timid about my drawings—because I was afraid I would do something to ruin them—the ease of layers and ⌘Z lets me try whatever comes to mind. I was also much more interested in a traditionally representational style back then, instead of the more illustration-based style I work in now. (Here's one of my older charcoal drawings to give you an idea of how much has changed.)  Which are the red drawings you mentioned? Color has been so much fun to work with after so long using a much more monochromatic palette."

ArtistLounge,3cb0uo,knox_vile,4,Mon Jul 6 14:38:52 2015 UTC,Have you thought about using paypal? You can generate an invoice to email that person so they alone can make the payment.
ArtistLounge,3cb0uo,kempsridley,3,Mon Jul 6 14:45:51 2015 UTC,"Whenever I sell something on Etsy to a specific person I mark it as ""RESERVED for xxxxx."" You can't set etsy to private, but courtesy should keep others from ordering it. Marking somethign reserved is generally the standard practice on Etsy. And if you need to, you can also say that you will cancel any order that is not from the person it is reserved for. I don't know if any of the other services would be better. If you are just using paypal, you can use it to send someone an invoice directly. Square can do the same thing. The fees on sending an invoice directly would be about half of what you would be charged on etsy."
ArtistLounge,3c991l,ItWillBeMine,3,Mon Jul 6 02:12:09 2015 UTC,"The larger the joint, the straighter the line. If I'm sitting at a table and want to draw a straight line I lock the entire upper half of my body and use my waist (amazing how straight of a line you can draw by simply leaning back :P) I also wouldn't recommend pushing a line. And also draw your straight lines vertically, not horizontally."
ArtistLounge,3c991l,funisher,2,Mon Jul 6 19:15:56 2015 UTC,"Try it out! I never really paid attention to how I drew lines, but it does make sense, and I realize I do basically the same thing.

ArtistLounge,3c991l,ravensashes,2,Mon Jul 6 03:45:36 2015 UTC,"The top comment there has it sort of right, but really it depends more on the scale you're working at. For small detailed stuff, pulling is more controlled, but if I'm working big (when I was an undergrad I used to mostly produce A0 sized pieces) then I lock my wrist completely and draw from the elbow. Of course, I draw mostly digitally these days, and that's another set of movements entirely."

I did my first proper pastel recently (out of stubbornness, because like you, I was finding it a %grrrr% medium - and I really wanted to conquer it, haha), and read up on how Manet and Degas used it - i.e. with an awful lot of fixing between layers. Tried it, and suddenly, it was a lot more fun. Takes a lot of patience, though. ;) I didn't have proper fixative, and didn't want to spend money on it either as it was just a try, so I used really dry hairspray. It worked, and the pic smells nice. Hehe. I really like your drawing, btw, so maybe you should try to make friends with those pastels. ;)"

ArtistLounge,3br8y6,goomy,2,Thu Jul 2 19:19:46 2015 UTC,"It's actually from wet felting! I wet felted up rolls of wool, and spiraled them around skewers and let them dry. Here's what they look like when they're drying. (I'm not good at how you link instagram?) :D  Edit: Wet felting is when you use hot water and soap and lots of agitation to felt the wool together, instead of needles. I suppose I should have mentioned that, instead of assuming everyone knows the difference!"

ArtistLounge,3brrft,chemikalische,3,Wed Jul 1 16:54:34 2015 UTC,"Looking great, bud!  I think one option would be to also use some darker pencil for the shadows (assuming you're doing it entirely in an HB mechanical pencil).  I know it can be hard to have strong contrast with one lead hardness, and it often gets washed out a bit more if scanned/photographed."
ArtistLounge,3brrft,follymiser,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:43:38 2015 UTC,Thank yoou - yess I'm only using HB pencils currently. I think I'll go over the darker tones and up the contrast a little more towards the end to finish it off. :)

ArtistLounge,3brfcu,CuriosityK,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:35:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I agree, she looks demonic or ghoulish. But I think that's part of what has me fascinated with drawing it like this...I'm skipping out on my favorite part to draw, too (eyes).  The whole faceless/matrixmouth thing started when I showed a few friends a WIP I was doing of Eliza Dushku that was still missing her mouth and iris. They said it looked creepy and suggested I keep it like that. So I did. But then I got the bug to do a Disney princess in this style. Now I want to do more ghoulish Disney princesses!  TL;DR: I'm fascinated with the idea of fairy tale princesses looking ghoulish...and it all started by accident."

ArtistLounge,3booe8,bellevuefineart,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:31:27 2015 UTC,"Look for a giclee printer if you want really good results. Canson Velin is very nice, so is Moab Entrada. Beware that home printers and smaller buble jet printers use dye based inks which fade over time, whereas giclee (pigmented inks) won't fade. Both Epson and Canon make good giclee printers.   With pen and ink on Velin the trick will also be to edit your files in photoshop so that you remove any color in the white areas. Ideally you want your white areas that show paper to have an RGB value of 255, 255, 255. Cheap prints always look grey, because the paper has a value when scanned that translates to a light grey...."

ArtistLounge,3bdcnr,ItWillBeMine,4,Sun Jun 28 03:45:25 2015 UTC,"I don't know. It's nice when they do give credit, but I certainly don't expect any when I've done something for free for someone I don't know, and usually as practice. Now if they remove a signature, that's different."
ArtistLounge,3bdcnr,bellevuefineart,3,Sun Jun 28 16:17:20 2015 UTC,"That's kind of you! I do think there are others who are in a different camp, though, based on feedback I've received over the years (artists messaging us to tell us they noticed someone posted their work online and didn't give credit)."
ArtistLounge,3bdcnr,bellevuefineart,4,Sun Jun 28 16:18:54 2015 UTC,"Again, I don't know, especially if it's just personal, like a personal FB page. A few months back I sat around one night and did a reverse image search on a lot of my artwork and photos (I volunteer doing ballet and dance photography as well). What I found was shocking. My artwork was everywhere, as were my photos. What surprised me was that while some people just took it with no credit (I had a reggae painting I did that was used for a reggae festival in London), most people gave full credit. My photographs were copyleft on Flickr, and I had credits all over the place, and thank you's and mentions.   I guess what I'm saying is that the pleasure I got from the mentions, and seeing my artwork and photography being appreciated and used, was far outweighed by the times it was just taken for granted. And I'd rather say taken for granted than stolen."
ArtistLounge,3bdcnr,carterartist,2,Sun Jun 28 16:25:19 2015 UTC,"I made an egyptian themed wallpaper for my wife's iphone years ago, and one day I was doing a reverse image search of some of my art; I found a band in Egypt using my artwork for their album, uncredited. :("
ArtistLounge,3bdcnr,bellevuefineart,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:14:56 2015 UTC,"That's kind of crappy. Artists should credit other aritsts. But at the same time it's kind of hard to argue that you lost any money. You did it as wallpaper for your wife's iphone, which has no real monetary value, and the band is probably broke. But recognition would be nice.   I've never found an instance where I would have made money off something somebody stole from me. However I do have a client that had her work stolen by Target. I urged her to contact a lawyer, and after she did, not only did they pay her and apologize, they also started licensing other works from her."
ArtistLounge,3bdcnr,carterartist,2,Tue Jun 30 14:04:21 2015 UTC,"Actually they had a legal responsibility to contact the artist for permission, the internet is not a free for all that removes the artist and his work from copyrights. The intent of my art is meaningless and does not matter to this. As for the ""lost money"", you are incorrect, there is the opportunity cost I lost because they had an artwork need and liked mine - if they had followed the law I would have been properly compensated. Recognition would not have just been nice but the legal and correct response after they asked for my permission.  Money or the lost opportunity to profit off one's work is not the onus for copyright infringement, and this is misconception is why everyone thinks it's okay to use Google as a stock photo site or question why company's use C&D's to protect their copyright.   By law, if you don't protect your copyright you run the risk of creating a legal precedent that could strip you of your rights."
ArtistLounge,3bdcnr,bellevuefineart,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:08:39 2015 UTC,"Hey, don't get me wrong, I'm not defending what they did at all, and I said it was wrong. But maybe there wasn't any lost opportunity. What I'm saying is that if you told them you wanted to charge them, they might have chosen something else, for free. And it may not have ever resulted in a commission even if you got credit. My point really is that a lot of the low level ""theft"" would never have resulted in either commissions or direct sales. So the real issue isn't that, it's the recognition, and the fact that someone who's doing creative work takes work from another artist with no mention or permission. That's kind of shitty, and it's happened to a lot of us, me included.   I'd love to see a link to what they stole. I'm always interested in that kind of thing."
ArtistLounge,3bdcnr,bellevuefineart,2,Tue Jun 30 16:55:41 2015 UTC,"The problem with not citing work on a personal FB page is that it can potentially cost a customer commissions. As who-died stated, people on FB will often ask ""Wow, where did you get that?"" sometimes with no response. It robs the artist of publicity and potential customers to simply share it without citing the artist.  Of course, I'm from the world of academia, where the importance of citing your source is drilled into our heads from Day One, so I have a particular perspective on it, that has grown due to feedback I've heard and received from many artists. It's okay for you to hold a different opinion. :)  It is great, btw, that your work has been widely distributed, especially if that works for you! That's exciting."
ArtistLounge,3bdcnr,bellevuefineart,2,Sun Jun 28 16:31:15 2015 UTC,I guess if I were looking for commissions I might feel differently. But God I hate commissions. Great big nope there. Maybe a QR code in the lower corner of each piece would help? I don't know.
ArtistLounge,3bdcnr,detroitvinyl,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:39:35 2015 UTC,"Ooo, you hate commissions? How come? :) Takes all the fun out of it? Customers too picky? Had some that fell through?"
ArtistLounge,3bdcnr,who-died,2,Sun Jun 28 16:53:08 2015 UTC,"It's the picky part I don't like. And even in my day job, which is scanning and reproducing fine art, I hate the out of the box requests. I used to like them and take them as a personal challenge, but more often than not they turn into a litany of ""move the fridge here, no move it there"" requests, and sudden, unreasonable deadlines. The attitude I most often see is ""I'm paying you, so you will do exactly what I ask. I'm PAYING"". At which point I very quickly come to the conclusion that they're not paying nearly enough for me to put up with their nonsense."
ArtistLounge,3bdcnr,notanamiibo,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:05:59 2015 UTC,"I've found the best way to deal with this is to have a clause in the contract that states the client can only request 5 (or whatever amount) revisions, and anything after that costs X amount."
ArtistLounge,3bduev,SpectreAnitaShepard,7,Sun Jun 28 07:40:38 2015 UTC,"well, I found its one thing to move your hand around the paper for some time a day and another to actually ""study"" things. You have to be focused mentally.  for example human poses. use websites like : posemaniacs.com or pixelovely to train quick sketches. But like at least 20 a day. and then commit to one painting or drawing a week. That sounds like a lot. But if you consider Professionals going for 8 hours something a day thinking, planning, sketching, drawing, painting away... it really isnt.  And maybe its time for you to go crazy with different media. discover digital. there are tons of cool (and free) programms out there. cheerz"
ArtistLounge,3bduev,zampalot,4,Sun Jun 28 15:51:39 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, there are lots of things you can try if you feel like your art is in a rut.  What kinds of things do you draw? Do you mostly stick to the same subjects? If so, switch it up. If you draw people all the time, try architecture for a while. Or landscapes, or cars, or objects you find around your house, whatever. When you draw a subject you've never drawn before, you have to develop a new visual vocabulary for it. It helps you develop new skills that you can use when you return to your original subjects.  Also, do you draw from life, or mostly from your imagination? When I first started drawing, I mostly doodled things off the top of my head. My art didn't improve until I started studying what my subjects really looked like. Photos are nice to draw from (and very convenient), but I recommend drawing from life when you can. Your eyes see light and color differently than a camera does. You can learn a lot from holding an object up to the light and tilting it around to see what the shadows do under different conditions.   Finally, you said you use pen, but do you always use the same type of pen? Have you tried brush pens, fineliners, ballpoints, a brush and ink, fountain pens, dip pens, or even straight up sketching your lines with paint? Using a different medium forces you to adjust your style, which can sometimes get you unstuck.  Drawing every day is great, but it's easy to get into a routine with what you draw and how you draw it. So mix things up a bit and see if that helps."
ArtistLounge,3bduev,ThisIsTheSameDog,3,Sun Jun 28 16:17:42 2015 UTC,"There's already great advice here about switching up topics and thought processes, but I'd also mention something I try to keep in mind: if you're drawing the same way you always do, you'll make the same art you always do.  Whether that's a good thing or a bad thing is up to you.  It sounds like you'd like to change things up.  I think using different tools and drawing different subjects will definitely help you with general drawing skills.  However, if you'd like to change your style then I think the most important thing is just to, well... not draw how you normally do.  By that I mean if you always make square chins and soft shadows, try making rounded or pointy chins and use hard light only.  Try exaggerating different features and draw your subjects much larger or smaller than you normally do.  You mentioned you exclusively use pen, so maybe try a couple drawings using no lineart.  There are lots of things you can do to ""improve,"" but I'll echo what /u/ProductofUnreality (and perhaps others) mentioned that just practice practice practice isn't always enough to make real gains."
ArtistLounge,3bduev,follymiser,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:05:22 2015 UTC,"My artistic life has been changing dramatically since I heard the phrase ""if you start all your paintings the same, you will always end up with the same kind of paintings.""   It amazes me how much you can improve your traditional glazing technique by working alla prima for a bit or simply by starting with a different colored underpainting or even just skipping the pencil sketch."
ArtistLounge,3bduev,ProductofUnreality,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:27:50 2015 UTC,"I feel like if I made honest effort to impact my style my overall skill would likely improve. As being so out of my drawing 'comfort zone' will make me look at things differently and reevaluate them.  Maybe I can try to sample out different styles? I know there's this one art meme where people put one figure on the left, one on the right, and in the center they force themselves to fuse the two. It's usually in reference to character design but I can likely do it with style too. Do you think that might be worthwhile?  I'm ready to do just about anything as being so solitary is driving me up the walls. Any kind of change would be granted, even if the payoff isn't immediate."
ArtistLounge,3bduev,ProductofUnreality,2,Tue Jun 30 03:48:58 2015 UTC,"Do you study? Plenty of people claim that all you need to do is practice practice practice, but they are wrong. You need to study and practice. Without study you're just practicing what you already know. It seems like that's your roadblock. Perhaps your ability and knowledge are at the same level and so you're not improving. Beef up your knowledge and your ability should follow."
ArtistLounge,3beue8,Airjus,6,Sun Jun 28 16:08:49 2015 UTC,You need to learn to mix your own paints for sure. Especially skin tones. I always start a painting by mixing colors. It's rare that you can use paint out of the tube and get what you want.
ArtistLounge,3beue8,bellevuefineart,4,Sun Jun 28 16:20:29 2015 UTC,"Time to study the color wheel! Take the time to learn about the difference between primary, secondary, and tertiary colors and how they are all mixed.  A good standard palette consists of roughly two versions of each primary (cool/transparent and warm/opaque), white, black, and a couple browns:  Titanium White  Ivory Black  Burnt Umber (cool and transparent)  Raw sienna (warm and opaque)  Lemon Yellow (it's cool and transparent)  Cadmium yellow (warm and opaque)  Yellow Ochre (this is just a useful color in general)  Ultramarine Blue (c/t)  Cobalt blue (w/o, though I tend to prefer cerulean instead)  Alizarin crimson (c/t)  Cadmium red (w/o)  Also be sure to buy a medium to mix with the paint, something like refined linseed oil or Liquin for oils, or matte medium for acrylic."
ArtistLounge,3beue8,funisher,2,Sun Jun 28 17:04:21 2015 UTC,"You should be able to mix your own with primary colors. I have never bought more than 12 colors, unless I needed neon or gold and silver."

ArtistLounge,3b3ej1,TheRealKozi,10,Thu Jun 25 17:23:34 2015 UTC,"Here's a little cost comparison of society6 vs printing your own and selling on etsy in the US.  If you sold an 8.5x11 piece on society6 for $18 you would get $5.31 in profit. They use professional giclee printers on thick fine art paper.  On Etsy from that same $18 you would take $0.83 in listing fees and $0.79 in payment processing fees if paid by direct payment. You would then need paper, say Hahhemuhle photo rag 310gsm which costs $39.31 from Amazon for 25 sheets or $1.57 per sheet. Ink according to this page for the Epson 3880 (which is what I have) costs $0.57 for an 8x10.   So the material and fee cost on Etsy is $3.76. But that's not the only cost, hopefully your customers pay shipping and shipping supplies, if they don't pay directly as a shipping fee, you've built it into the price they pay. Society6 has an added shipping fee. Shipping supplies are cheaper bought in bulk but that means you pay upfront and don't recoup the cost until you use up the supplies. Usually you would need a clearbag with a backing board to protect the print along with a hard shipping envelope.  Bags 100 @ $11 Boards 100 @ $20 Shipping Envelopes 100 @ $28  Which comes to $0.59 per print.  But the real cost comes in time and how long it takes to print out your print, reprint if your printer's inkhead is clogged, pack it up, print the label, then either take it to the post office or have it picked up. Say if you value your time at $30 per hour, if it takes even 10 minutes to do all that, that's $5 of time right there where you could be making more art.   You also have to recoup the cost of the printer. Epson's new 17"" wide P800 costs $1295, if you want to recoup say $3 per print, you would need to sell 431 prints.  That adds up to $11.65 in cost. Or $6.35 in profit. Not that different from what you get from Society6, is it? :)  Then what happens if the shipment is lost or damaged, or they want to return it? Society6 takes care of all that. Etsy does not.  Of course you can use online printers to make your prints for you rather than buying your own printer. But then again it's more efficient to buy a bunch at once rather than 1 at a time. And you'd have a bunch of stock sitting around waiting to be sold. Some artists will sell first then print so they know that what they print will be sold, but usually they are already sure they can sell it being popular and all. Or if you're going to a convention/art show, you'll need a bunch of prints ready to sell.  And there are cheaper printers if you're not printing larger prints but their ink costs jump.  *Note, I have stores on Etsy and Artfire (where I print my own prints) and Society6, Redbubble, Smugmug, and Zazzle. (which print and ship for me when someone orders). I've sold more through Etsy than the others."
ArtistLounge,3b3ej1,ObeyMyBrain,2,Fri Jun 26 00:56:26 2015 UTC,Woah! Thank you for the in-depth reply. Definitely gives me something to think about and a great perspective.   I think for now I'd go the society 6 route simply because it seems the most low risk and has little overhead. I don't imagine I'd sell many prints and if I did start selling more or sell them privately at shows I might look at investing in a printer. It's just a big up front cost to eat.   Thank you again
ArtistLounge,3b3ej1,keenedge422,2,Fri Jun 26 01:28:32 2015 UTC,"Well the nice thing about Society6 is that you can ""set it and forget it"" and it'll keep churning out prints for you as people keep ordering them. With Etsy, even if you're using a secondary printing company rather than printing/shipping on your own, you're still involved on each order as the go-between.  The only advantage I can really imagine for Etsy is the larger built-in audience, which means more people who can stumble across your work and buy it. Of course, that can also work in the other direction because there's so much available that you risk getting lost in the noise."
ArtistLounge,3b3ej1,ihaveacutepuppy,3,Fri Jun 26 13:52:44 2015 UTC,"I have an Etsy store but I also have my own professional giclee printer.   I get an order, print and send it myself. Etsy charge 20 cents per listing plus 2.4%commission on a sale. Have a look into society6 as they print and ship for you. . They have a range of products too so it might be cheaper for you to start out with. Society6 have a base charge and you decide what profit you want to make.  Shameless link if you want to look at my store www.vfitzartist.etsy.com :)"
ArtistLounge,3b3ej1,follymiser,2,Thu Jun 25 20:28:29 2015 UTC,Have you noticed a big difference in volume or tastes between your Etsy and Society6 offerings?  I.e. are people buying more of one type of print from one site and a different set off of another?
ArtistLounge,3b3ej1,ihaveacutepuppy,2,Thu Jun 25 20:33:53 2015 UTC,"Hi there, sorry I should have said I only have an Etsy store.. I've thought about getting a society6 store but i probably wouldn't offer prints as I've spent so much time and money on my printer that I'd like to keep the same quality. I guess it just depends on your art style.. some are really popular but niches are hard. If yoy already have people asking for prints then thats a good start! !"
ArtistLounge,3b3ej1,ObeyMyBrain,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:48:19 2015 UTC,"Society6 does very high quality printing on fine art paper. My opinion is that you could be losing sales, as long as you're not doing limited editions why not have them on both etsy and society6? You might get less profit from society6 but you have to do less work. See my other comment about a sample price breakdown."
ArtistLounge,3b3ej1,ihaveacutepuppy,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:58:25 2015 UTC,I guess i could put my non limited edition prints on there just to see how it goes..  most of my work is originals and limited editions though.

Wordpress is nice and easy. Noobs like me can just watch an online-tutorial if they don't understand anything. Wordpress is very well documented. - A Wordpress Blog using Thesis: Later we switched the website to Thesis, which is more than just a Template. It really increases the possibilities you have and it is very easy to maintain, to customize and also well documented. I get it. But I'm thinking about switching to another, neater Theme right now. - Blogspot: Completely free and you can put ads on there without trouble. This is in my experience by far the easiest way to have a website without paying anything or get into any coding languages.

It's been a great fit for me—free hosting, great mobile tools, great community feedback (a lot of RGD regulars are there, as is an official RGD blog that shares work from artists), and a ton of good templates that can be customized to your liking.

Yeah.  I'd love to come on the show, but I don't think I've got the required kit unless you know of a way to make an ipad camera work for it? Not that confident that crappy Aussie internet would cope either...

I tend to guestimate rather than actually work it out. So I decided to try and recreate a wizard house I dreamt about using 2 and 3 point perspective.

ArtistLounge,3ao7k1,adillac,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:22:17 2015 UTC,"you might find it fun to, instead of splattering the paint, paint onto a wet page (just brush it with some water, don't soak it), let it bled naturally and then come in with inky neat graphic stuff. It could also be fun to try and make your jelly fish out of whatever shape the paint bleeds into.  If you decide to try it please post the result!"

ArtistLounge,3a5syk,follymiser,2,Thu Jun 18 18:55:10 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  Well, I've done a webcomic before but I stopped for a long long time. So afterwards, I've always had that itch that I should do a regular one again. My biggest hurdle was actually finding a concept to stick to. I know it's lame and cliche to focus on a relationship but it's what I enjoy drawing about so far! Maybe when I think of a story to stick to, I'll put up another series but it's what inspires me so far. :D"
ArtistLounge,3a5syk,enmoshin,2,Thu Jun 18 19:16:00 2015 UTC,"Ohh a veteran, eh? :)  I think sometimes the simple/straightforward concepts are best.  You can always add interesting tidbits later, and you don't have to worry about including 3 pages of backstory to explain what your comic is about.  I'm wanting to make a comic (probably just a one-shot, not a serial), but it's a completely new thing to me.  I love creating, but it can be very daunting."
ArtistLounge,3a5syk,AGamerDraws,2,Thu Jun 18 19:34:02 2015 UTC,"Haha, barely a veteran! I finished only one thirty-page comic and I think I got burnt out.  I agree that simple concepts are the best concepts, as a reader and a creator!  You really should do it! I believe comics are one of the best exercises as an artist. It is really daunting but I think the most important thing is to enjoy what you're doing, always try to improve, and eventually you'll find a flow to it!"
ArtistLounge,3a2qmr,saundersaur,4,Tue Jun 16 19:41:39 2015 UTC,"For things you want control of, host your own site.  I've helped a few very small artists and performance art organizations set up sites for themselves using cheap hosting services like hostgator or godaddy.  These will however cost you under $10 a month for hosting but that's a lot of money compared to free, and the marketing will be up to you.  If you don't market that site, only search engine robots will ever see what you do, so it's a lot more work.  Things like imgur and deviant art are great, but you have to understand, someone, somewhere put in a bunch of effort to market these things, pay for hard drive space, server processing time, visible to other people.  Also you can upload albums to Imgur, unless they have changed that in the past couple months, I don't know where you're getting an image an hour from it.  You have to realize, the internet isn't free.  If you want to share things that don't sit well with the advertising plan of a particular 'free' site, you have to create it yourself and pony up the funds to keep it running, put in the time to market it.  Otherwise deal with the brutality of being under the thumb of someone elses policy.  Especially with nudity, despite so much progress having been made."
ArtistLounge,3a2qmr,KingradKong,3,Wed Jun 17 01:19:07 2015 UTC,You could make a portfolio on Behance maybe?
ArtistLounge,3a2qmr,George_Shrinks,4,Wed Jun 17 05:15:09 2015 UTC,Why not tumblr?
ArtistLounge,3a2qmr,polygraf,2,Wed Jun 17 01:42:36 2015 UTC,"I've been hosting and posting my own art on my own website since 97. Some of my work is of nudes, and I've never had a problem.   Recently I switched my web hosting to wordpress, because I suck at coding and it saves me time, plus it's cheaper for me. You don't have to use it as a blog, although I do have one. You can make the front page of your website whatever you want. You don't even need to pay for a domain name, although I do. You could do it all for free if you wanted to.   You could do the same with Tumblr or another blog site too."
ArtistLounge,3a2qmr,Fey_fox,2,Wed Jun 17 03:35:58 2015 UTC,"The choice is imgur - not sure how you're doing it, but there isn't a time limit on it. I've made albums with 100+ images....took less than 15 minutes."
ArtistLounge,3a2qmr,ItWillBeMine,2,Tue Jun 16 20:15:11 2015 UTC,Or....build your own server and web site. Just a suggestion.
ArtistLounge,3a2qmr,Dmunman,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:30:45 2015 UTC,"Imgur only allows one image an hour? It's never limited me before... But, I don't upload that much stuff.  Do you have your stuff in a dropbox or google drive? If you have a google drive, you can easily flip everything to Google Photos, and make albums that are open to the public. Then you can make enormous photo albums like this one I have on my #ACatADay photos. Nearly everyone HAS a google account, even if they don't use it on G+. I have no idea what their precise policies are on nudity, but even if you have to restrict the access to the album in some way, like I said, everyone has G+, even if they don't use it, so you can hand out access to the album like candy, I'm sure.  Just an option I thought of in like 2 seconds, no idea if it'll work. /shrug"

Okay, it's not one image an hour. But I've had to wait 15 minutes between uploads, and I like to upload full-res images, which take 5 minutes to upload, or even more.

Honestly, I hate that reddit hasn't synced images with google photos yet. It's silly. I have all my pics uploaded on GPhotos, but I daren't link them with GPhotos or people complain, instead I have to either share them to my IG, or go through the mess of sharing them to imgur, then making an album on imgur, then linking that, and don't even try to do that on mobile, because the imgur ap is garbage. /rant. #firstworldartistproblems   :D"
ArtistLounge,3a2qmr,AGamerDraws,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:34:08 2015 UTC,"I have this same issue with Imgur. A lot of the time I give up trying to use it because it just takes too long or seems to completely fail. So the options are - make the artwork lower resolution or give up for me. I would highly recommend setting up your own website with your artwork as a portfolio for you. That way there is always a base that people can find your work anyway and you will have full control over it. Then use other sites to advertise your site (imgur, DA etc)"
ArtistLounge,3a2qmr,jackjohnbrown,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:01:58 2015 UTC,"For free I'd say: Imgur (I've never run into the limit you mention; sounds like you're uploading them in a weird way maybe?), Google Photos (which will down-res to a degree if you're not paying for it), or tumblr (which lacks albums but lets you group images by a tagging system. (Check out the images on my site to see the tag system—one advantage to this is that the same image can be in several ""albums"".)  In general, I think any free option is going to have issues if you're wanting to upload in full-res."
ArtistLounge,3a2qmr,eggpl4nt,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:03:55 2015 UTC,"Tumblr or Blogger/Blogspot. Or your own website for total control. I got a couple nude studies on my Tumblr and I don't have my blog marked NSFW. It's art. Haven't gotten banned or warned or anything so meh.   I feel like giving up, like it's not worth it anymore and I should just keep all my stupid ""offensive"" nude artwork to myself because apparently that's what the world wants me to do.   That attitude ain't gonna get you nowhere."
ArtistLounge,3a2qmr,vi0l33ts,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:01:50 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, DA has a policy against pornography, not nude art.  All you have to do is make sure your art is listed as NSFW and you should be fine.  I'm on DA daily and come up against nudity, even sexually explicit nudity daily."
ArtistLounge,3a26sp,GloryMewcroft,2,Tue Jun 16 17:25:28 2015 UTC,"The proportions are off, but the details are very good! You've got an eye for it, obviously, just need some work with getting the base figure lines down to the right size. Nice job!"
ArtistLounge,3a28fh,saundersaur,2,Tue Jun 16 17:36:21 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on a couple things, such as your goals and your audience.  Are you trying to show your art journey over time?  Are you hoping to show people your style and what you can do?  Are you just looking to create a ""portfolio"" you can reference later?  Maybe it's just a dumping site so you don't lose the drawings later.  I think when you're starting out in art it's good to post whatever you've got.  This makes it easier for you to connect with artists that are looking for a similar style or to get help from others (""hey can you look at my gallery and give me some tips?"" ""I've sketched some ideas out, but I don't know where I'm going with it"").  If you're actually trying to put together a sort of gallery or portfolio, I think posting too many sketches can clutter things up if they don't have a point.  One thing I'll see people do is have a ""sketch page"" that has like two, tiny hands and part of an eye.  I think at that point it's kind of a waste.  It's much more interesting to see a full sketch page, rather than clicking on a bunch of pages that have like one doodle on them.  Obviously if you're working on something and need help from someone, post whatever you're working on so they can see it.  What you could do is have one profile to dump all your sketches and one profile to dump just the ""better"" stuff.  Or if it's something like dA you could have a folder for the sketches and a folder for completed drawings.  I'm all for posting lots of stuff online; I just think it's important to keep your audience and goals in mind when doing so."

ArtistLounge,3a28fh,CuriosityK,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:47:38 2015 UTC,"I decided to separate out where I post certain content. Although I'm really slacking in updating my deviant art this is the guide I follow personally:  On my Tumblr, I post everything. This is to provide a more consistent stream of content, and allows me to post anything I want.   On my personal website (which I turned into a wordpress blog a couple years ago) I post my more presentable pieces and my better looking sketches. If I remembered to update my Deviant Art I would follow the same guidelines. This is to keep my ""portfolio"" less cluttered. I occassionally make a post with a dump of some of the sketches I've done lately, but usually with the better looking ones.  I've been trying to get back into art (the past 10 years I haven't really, just did work instead), and I find that I do better if I post my sketches for a more consistent feeling of accomplishment. I'm not much of a Tumblr user (in fact I never had used it before I started my sketch dumps), but I wanted a less formal place to just post my doodles, and Tumblr seemed to perfect format.  Especially since Tumblr is just another avenue I could utilize that already has an audience.  I keep my DA and Website more cleaned up. Which reminds me...I should probably update my DA..."

I would also wager that most creative people will have another form of showing off their work - Deviantart/facebook/personal website so you could contact them via that so your reddit username never comes into the discussion.  Having done work myself for people on reddit I've never felt the need - once knowing peoples real names to turn into a psycho and stalk them.

Oh, definitely! But the artist community here is very close-knit, and many of them talk off-site/off-line. It only takes one mention to start a game of 'telephone,' and then the information ends up with someone whom I don't feel comfortable having it. So I'd really prefer to do it anonymously or not at all.   I would also wager that most creative people will have another form of showing off their work - Deviantart/facebook/personal website so you could contact them via that so your reddit username never comes into the discussion.   I've thought about this (just going to an artist's store and buying something without mentioning who I am), but a google search of my name shows my face, and my face has been posted in RGD enough to know that it's me, so that wouldn't be a secure enough form of anonymity for me, either.   Having done work myself for people on reddit I've never felt the need - once knowing peoples real names to turn into a psycho and stalk them.

ArtistLounge,39teeb,westopher718,2,Sun Jun 14 16:24:12 2015 UTC,"I've had quite a few people ask me to draw tattoos for them. I only agree if I actually care about that person, and they are asking because they want me to draw it and have something I drew on their body. I tell people no when they are basically asking for a free service instead of asking a tattoo artist do it. I don't want my mark left on someone's body that I don't give a shit about.  Yeah, there is definitely pressure when drawing a tattoo. I take more time and am a lot more precise with measurement than I normally would be. It is flattering to be asked. I'm actually more worried about the tattoo artist making it look like crap, even though I know they're just tracing it, which is why I don't have any tattoos."
ArtistLounge,39teeb,detroitvinyl,2,Sun Jun 14 19:56:08 2015 UTC,"I've had several requests for tattoos and have also had people show me my work on their skin at conventions.  It's very flattering and it's always amazing to see that kind of dedication and love for the art. I always do my best to create work that the customer will love, and will turn people away, or towards particular artists, if I feel I can't do a good enough job on their particular project. I like to communicate frequently with tattooists so I can make sure I don't make their lives harder. I also make it very clear that a tattooist will know more about what looks good on the skin and that they may have the work changed in the final version to suit this.  I think the biggest disappointment for me is when the client won't spend out for a very good tattooist which can lead to issues where the original artwork isn't going to match up to the final piece on the skin. I always try to recommend well documented, fantastic tattoo artists that are local to the client, but it is up to them if they choose to go to one of them.  It definitely adds a certain pressure, but as long as you are up front with the client about what you are particularly skilled with and that the tattooist will have final says about changes, revisions and refinements then it can be a lot easier.  Edit: As long as the client absolutely loves the artwork as a stand alone piece then I am happy. Something I recommend to clients is that they put the art on their wall or their phone background for a while. That way they can make sure it's something they will continue to love while they are saving up to put it on their skin."

ArtistLounge,39q8hd,graymankin,4,Mon Jun 15 02:25:25 2015 UTC,"I always want to have this discussion, but the majority of people in forums are either pure hobbyist (that's fine) or people don't want to share their secret or genuinely don't know. Or you're a ""sell-out"".   Obviously, selling two paintings a year is hardly enough to live off of. You need to make promotion and seeking out potential opportunities a priority, whether online, in person, or wherever you go. I don't know anything about your art, but it's about finding an audience. I've been trying to do this on the Internet for 12 years - I find it was actually easier in the past when the Internet was less saturated and people were less promotion allergic. You have to be smart about how you show art these days. Some people go spam and it works for them, others have many different sites, others hang out on forums and form friendships that lead to interest.   It's also important to go beyond the computer and show your art to anyone who shows interest, an art fair, cafes, galleries, ect. It's actually easier to sell in person - people can see it physically, the see you, they get to know you and become invested. Part of that is working on social skills. You can't be too shy, and you also can't come off as arrogant and pretentious.   You also have to have a variety in what you sell. Small pieces, large pieces, prints, sketches. You also have to keep improving. One thing that's very important is the efficiency of how you make art. It either means you can do more for less or make better income. It's also important to have good presentation - nothing worse to me than bad photography of art or not having a site or page to point people to who want to see your art.   I've learned there's no magic answer and you have to constantly adapt. One of the best things to happen to me was a few art collectors taking interest, so they regularly return to my site and take interest in recent work."

It goes very few places, and it's very slow. I love it when I sell stuff on Etsy, and I am selling more now that I've moved into needle felting, but the market online is super saturated. You need to get out in public. Art is an experience.   If you're spending time vacuuming, and wondering about that, can you turn that into something creative?  I dunno. I work a full time job, and I still try to make art a BIG DEAL in my life, so I can stay sane. It's not a hobby to me. But, I have in no ways made it in any way shape or form big enough to consider it anything but a thing I do to help the normal job income. I make peanuts with my art.  However, that said. Make things you can be passionate about, because if you make anything people like, you may end up making a hundred of them. Keep exploring. Someone will find what you make and will want it.   BUT. If you can't make it just doing art... get a regular job and don't feel bad about it, and do your art on the side. You'll find time. You will always find time to do your art if it's that important to you. I fit in my needle felting in the tiniest chunks of time cuz I practically get the shakes if I don't do it.  Don't waste time. Get it done, and get it out there."

I put a little of my own art on pinterest as well, and as you can see other than vague color palette similarities I find more diverse stuff to be more inspiring. But like, not too different?

ArtistLounge,39kv34,funisher,3,Fri Jun 12 17:58:11 2015 UTC,"This is the color chart I was referring to:  http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-c9JCgylzCvg/Ugg6aJs16KI/AAAAAAAARCM/aWIRNZ58eG4/s1600/rbg+for+hair.JPG  The dark auburn, I was told specifically, is actually brown.  I actually set up a tumblr -- http://offcolorart.tumblr.com -- where I attempt to convey what it is I see, since it's really hard to explain without any experiences of seeing normally."
ArtistLounge,39kv34,funisher,3,Fri Jun 12 18:07:08 2015 UTC,"Just followed that tumblr! And damn, the dark auburn totally looked like auburn to me...crap. :/"
ArtistLounge,39kv34,imagination_pulp,3,Fri Jun 12 18:14:06 2015 UTC,"Great idea you have going on with your blog.. funny story, the other day I was coloring some eyes on one of my characters and my friend came over to see what I was drawing up. I thought I was drawing in dark green/brown eyes, then my friend points out they are red. Hahaha  Yes I've also been struggling getting colors correct while painting, an idea I had is to have a color picker that picks the color you're hovering over and also tells the name of the color based on the rgb color code.  I saw those glasses on your tumblr page, maybe that will be the answer to our unfortunate silly mistakes!"

ArtistLounge,39i38f,ArtFriend,2,Fri Jun 12 02:08:58 2015 UTC,Ah thanks :D I was always very impressed by people that would just stick to their goals and now I'm slowly learning it too!

ArtistLounge,39i38f,Hika-Tamari,3,Fri Jun 12 12:09:51 2015 UTC,"Wow congratulations! I tried 5 times to enter an ""art"" school (here in Switzerland it's called art school but it's mostly design and graphic school...), and from these 5 times, 3 times were at the same school. At the 3rd time I applied to that school, they saw me in an interview, for the 3rd time... And they were like ""Wow, you really want to come into our school! And your work has really improved! Great job, you're one of our best applicants!""  I was ecstatic. Until I receive the mail that says that no, I can't enter.  But I now realize it's my fault, because I did not learn enough various things. I'm glad you had the possibility to learn all that year and do it with other students, and professors. We sadly don't have such things in there.  Congrats !!!!"
ArtistLounge,39i38f,Hika-Tamari,1 point,Fri Jun 12 07:02:06 2015 UTC,"Dankeschön :)   Oh that's a pity to come so far and still be turned down. I kind of weaseled my way into their, it was nothing official but I understand that most places shut down things like this categorically.  So what do you do now? Will you try again?"
ArtistLounge,39i38f,cobra1975,2,Fri Jun 12 12:54:51 2015 UTC,":)  Yeah, and I tried to call them to have a reason... Not necessarily coming off as angry, but in order to know, even more since they said it was one of their best work of the year...  Now, I work in IT. I probably won't try again. We don't have anything great art-wise in Switzerland, I should move to France, and do not wish to move there. I have my life together and need money to pay rent and bills so yeah, I gave up on my illustration work life. :/"
ArtistLounge,39i38f,Gaderael,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:37:46 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's better this way. You know the saying about making a hobby your job...  Having your life together sounds pretty good! I think in the end the goal is anyway to become content with your life. And who knows, you wouldn't be the first person that does art on the side and later slowly turns it into a business. Might even be a smarter way to go about it than just diving into it and not having any qualifications to make money on the side and then giving up after a few years of hardship."
ArtistLounge,39i38f,ItWillBeMine,2,Fri Jun 12 14:05:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know, tho I can't imagine being bothered by this, but you know, I'm not in the situation!  Yeah, actually I'd be pretty content if I could interest people enough to be asked for comission. Not for the money part, but the artistic part of it.  Anyway I'm super happy for you, I still think it's fantastic to be accepted in a great artistic school !"

ArtistLounge,39h3ko,travlawl,2,Thu Jun 11 17:54:45 2015 UTC,I often sketch out many rough copies of different poses/perspectives before committing

ArtistLounge,39h3ko,hollyhooo,2,Thu Jun 11 20:51:54 2015 UTC,"Go wild dude! Don't worry about the first few sketches not being what you pictured. And if you're still having trouble, honestly even with drawings completely from my imagination I often pull up 10 reference photos with little bits and pieces of the whole image in my imagination. Ex: Fantasy character I designed recently: did not resemble a human form at all but I still referenced human hands, human posture, human arms, animal skin texture, and many other things."
ArtistLounge,39h3ko,Astro-nautical,2,Fri Jun 12 13:31:14 2015 UTC,"Learn proportions. Until you get a subconcious grip on how long the torso is conpared to the head, compares to the arms, compared to the hip, etc, etc. You WILL have to use reference."
ArtistLounge,39h3ko,Astro-nautical,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:13:11 2015 UTC,Do you think doing quick gesture pose drawings would be good practice for this? Or should I do more drawings where I focus on someone for a longer period of time?
ArtistLounge,39h3ko,mindivy,2,Thu Jun 11 20:54:34 2015 UTC,"Gesture would be a great place to start, but sitting down for a longer pose (be it with a model or a picture) to really try to memorize the human canon e.g. how many heads long is the body, that the first head down from the chin gets to the nipple line? etc. will also help you tremendously. Also, copying artwork from artists you like while actively trying to figure out how they constructed their figures."
ArtistLounge,39h3ko,mindivy,2,Fri Jun 12 01:16:02 2015 UTC,"We all use reference materials.  You can get better at drawing figures by doing model studies, maybe spend at least an hour twice a week on 2 minute gesture drawings, and another 6 hour per week on nude models (just get internet reference pics if you don't have access to a class.) After 2-3 years you'll get pretty good at it.  Get an artists anatomy book and work through it. Draw all of the different body parts, bones muscles.  You will still use a lot of reference (life and photo), but by that point you will internalize human body structure and be able to draw realistic poses.   Remember that all of the great masters used models. When starting a finished piece or commission work, I will draw maybe 20-30 sketches until I get it right, then blow up the one I like and transfer it onto my paper/canvas."
ArtistLounge,39h3ko,JustToLurkArt,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:27:34 2015 UTC,"Very helpful suggestions, especially the anatomy book. I feel like my knowledge of the human anatomy is very lacking, so learning the bone structure/muscles better will definitely be helpful. As for those 20-30 sketches you do, how far into them do you get before you make your decision? Like are they more along the lines of stick figured sketches where you're mapping out the pose, or do you get like a very simplistic version of the drawing your going for first?"
ArtistLounge,39h3ko,JustToLurkArt,2,Thu Jun 11 20:59:49 2015 UTC,"It sort of varies. Most of them are very rough, I am looking for an abstract design foundation to build on. Depending on how many separate elements I am working on,  my sketches will reach varying levels of completeness before incorporating them into the final. Honestly,  I often wonder if this isn't just an advanced form of procrastination, but a solid foundation is so important to a finished work that I can write it off as a cost of being creative.  Admittedly, I don't work very fast."
ArtistLounge,39h3ko,blazing_ent,2,Thu Jun 11 21:33:05 2015 UTC,Drawing from imagination is a highly advanced skill gained only when drawing for many many years from life. Even when master artists draw from memory they still use elements of reality. You may be under-estimating the difficulty and amount of time it takes to learn to draw proficiently.

ArtistLounge,3990w9,willdrawyourface,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:12:05 2015 UTC,"The drawing is good! As for the painting, it needs more edge variation. A lot of the edges are very soft, but places like the jaw line and the nose could use more definition.  Also, with youthful skin you want to avoid using grey or less saturated colors. I think adding a little more saturation where the light isn't very strong makes the flesh look more alive. This painting (NSFW) is a good example because it is doesn't use a lot of saturation, but you can tell in the shadows that the colors are still stronger. Keep up the good work!"

I think you are using the soft brush too much, which is making your work look quite blurry instead of refined. Try playing with the hard brush, or even at 75 or 50% hardness, and work on refining things. The hair is good, as well. You did good with the form and making the highlights/lowlights show the look of it without drawing every strand."

Coming into your natural art style already a big hurdle, and coming up with new styles is ever more challenging. Whatever feels best is never wrong, though. It's cliche as hell but it's true. The better you feel about the style, the more confidently you create it - usually leads to better end result. Just gotta keep feeling it out!"

ArtistLounge,392mrj,dead_painter,2,Mon Jun 8 20:25:22 2015 UTC,"Goddamn I miss the museums in Minnesota. I remember they had the flag one when I was a child, I loved that painting when they first had it. That is an awesome place. Do they still have the soup bowl and spoon made of fur? Or the... Oh what was it called? It was a giant face of a guy with glasses on, and a city reflected in his glasses. It was a self portrait, but huge, like a 7 ft tall. Gorgeous work. Was it that museum or the other one? The one with the cherry spoon or the one with the glass chandelier and the bean bag chair on the ceiling?   I grew up in Minnesota and my family frequented the art museums all the time. They would go to the fancy shows and I would wander around, then my school also had field trips. I loves going, unlike most kids my age. I don't remember any of the names, and the places get all mixed up. I know the works I saw.   I miss them. I live in a smaller city now. I haven't been to the art museums here. I have this strange and probably unfounded worry that they won't live up to my expectations. The one history museum I went to was the real touristy one, and it was... not what I wanted.   Once again, as always, I am blathering on. So I will shut up. Than you for the album and the trip down memory lane. If you find the driftwood landscape from Duluth, or one of the giant classical landscapes filled with cherubs and imps and Greek goddesses, or the huge jade crystal carving, say hi to them for me."
ArtistLounge,392mrj,CuriosityK,2,Tue Jun 9 05:51:15 2015 UTC,"I know a couple of those! The huge self-portrait (nearly 11 feet tall) is by Chuck Close and is still in the Walker's collection. The Minneapolis Institute of Arts has another huge piece by Close. The famous Cherry Spoon is by Claes Oldenberg is still in the sculpture garden across the street from the Walker.  Another great piece is The Large Blue Horses by Franz Marc. A funny  newspaper article taunting Hitler (he hated the painting, but of course it went on to great critical acclaim) is on display next to the painting.  I'm glad I could give you a small glimpse into your childhood. The museums here are special to me as well."
ArtistLounge,392mrj,CuriosityK,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:58:39 2015 UTC,"Ah, I love that Chuck Close piece. The one I'm remembering is the MIA one, Frank. I saw both Chuck Close's a lot, so I think I mentally meshed them together. It's kinda neat to see them separately after all these years. Frank's glasses changed in my memory after all these years, hahaha!  We used to watch plays at the Walker, my parents had a yearly thing there. So I played around the Cherry Spoon, and in the green house. Every couple of years the park would get a new exhibit in the park. I liked the ones we could climb on. I don't think they'll ever get rid of that cherry, it's iconic!  I love, love, love the Blue Horses. I remember thinking Franz Marc must paint from his dreams. I never saw the article. The painting is gorgeous, though. I've noticed with abstracts like these they are like 90% better when you've seen them for real. Seeing them on the canvas makes them more alive. Those horses are powerful creatures. You lose some of that with a picture on the internet. You can't see the flow of the paint or something. I remember staring at the horses for a long time and wondering how I could ever portray that kind of power in anything I made.  Ha! I found another favorite! This one by George Segal. He had a bunch of plaster people for a while there. I read how he made them and thought it was cool, but I wouldn't want to be one of the models.   Oh man, this is a trip down memory lane. I could talk about the museums for ages. I probably shouldn't."

ArtistLounge,390xlo,zampalot,5,Mon Jun 8 23:52:45 2015 UTC,If it's a pen and ink drawing anywhere from 3-5 hours. Trying to get it faster though.
ArtistLounge,390xlo,funisher,7,Mon Jun 8 15:44:59 2015 UTC,"I had this really cool exercise I was doing recently were I would only allow myself 15 minutes to draw, and after that it was pencils down. The trick was, I could look at the picture for as long as I wanted beforehand. Sometimes I'd look for 20 minutes before drawing, sometimes over an hour.  I think it really got me into the mindset of carefully examining the reference (as they say you should be looking at the reference more than your own drawing), actually taking the time to measure out proportions and angles and underlying construction, and plan out how I would draw things. After that I think the speed of the drawing helped me loosen up and find my style."
ArtistLounge,390xlo,OftenPyr,2,Mon Jun 8 17:54:46 2015 UTC,I'm totally gonna try this exercise!
ArtistLounge,390xlo,darktalonblood,2,Tue Jun 9 05:00:38 2015 UTC,"Usually ~45 minutes. I'm planning to try to spend more time on the  initial sketches in the future, because I feel that likeness is suffering at the moment. I couldn't spend more time on the watercolour with my current style, it would become overworked."

ArtistLounge,390xlo,AcceptThisUsername,3,Mon Jun 8 20:15:53 2015 UTC,Some come together really quickly or I just want a loose style like this one that only took around 25-35 minutes. On the other side I'll take up to 4 or 5 hours for something like this. I'm really slow at digital media though. This onetook something in the neighborhood of 10 hours. But there's some that don't make it too far because I'm struggling with the image or technique.

I start with watercolor background, then let it dry. I then do an acrylic under painting and let it dry. I then coat it with clear acrylic, let it dry. Then oil paint at the end, usually in two layers over a two day period."
ArtistLounge,390xlo,bellevuefineart,2,Tue Jun 9 00:21:11 2015 UTC,"I usually do mine during lunch, so within an hour. Granted I've had a few that I did outside of lunch (or finished after work) and those I've contributed a few more hours to. I like RGD mostly as a ""daily"" exercise. Maybe that's why I have yet to get a purple badge, maybe if I put a few more hours ;)"
ArtistLounge,390xlo,carterartist,2,Tue Jun 9 00:28:56 2015 UTC,"For me it's about between three to six hours (not necessarily consecutive), which translate to a couple of nights, for something that I can consider sufficiently done. But my standards for ""done"" are all over the place, depending on what I'm trying to do. Usually sketches take no more of an hour, but then I start playing with the tablet and things get reeeeeally slow for me (and I've always considered myself slow for the job :P). I love the tablet but I hate how unnatural it feels (for me)"
ArtistLounge,390xlo,darktalonblood,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:55:42 2015 UTC,"Usually takes me anywhere from 2-6 hours depending on the complexity. I mostly use pen and markers, with colour pencil from time to time.   It doesn't help that I'm a major procrastinator."

My more successful non-RGD portraits for friends have taken 4 + hours, and I either used a grid or a window to trace the features at the beginning. Tonight, I tried to just work quickly freehand and see how it went; this wasn't fast, but under two hours. Some of the lines are too harsh, and the shading could use more work, but all in all, it feels like improvement.   Totally unrelated, when you posted that photo of your sister the other day, I didn't see your user name before I clicked it, and I thought, ""hey, the Sarge's sister must have submitted this."" You guys look SO similar! :)"

ArtistLounge,39093t,hauntedorangemobile,2,Mon Jun 8 08:31:38 2015 UTC,"Great album (I love the fourth one from the end,  with the green),  and great idea for a post!   My goals for the rest of the year:   Be more careful about proportions and likeness. Stop rushing my drawings/paintings. I'll have more time on  my hands in July and August, so I'm planning to spend more time on each individual piece during the summer. I usually spend <1 h on a RGD,  I'm going to try to atleast double that!  Sketch more from life, both people and other stuff.  Develop the vector stuff I've been doing in /r/dailysketch."
ArtistLounge,39093t,sgt_mary_mary,1 point,Mon Jun 8 09:22:54 2015 UTC,"I didn't realize you did your rgds so quickly! That's impressive. Watercolors are kind of intimidating to me, and I just assume they take a long time!   How does the vector art compare to your traditional portraits? I've never entirely understood how vector art works and what makes it vector vs not vector (which makes me feel kind of dumb) but it looks so cool. Do you use photoshop, or is it illustrator? Is it harder, do you think? I can't remember the redditor's name, but there was someone who did those like...mosaic/stained glass looking portraits for a while, right? Is that the same thing? (Sorry for all of the questions!)"
ArtistLounge,39093t,sgt_mary_mary,2,Mon Jun 8 23:51:31 2015 UTC,"Watercolour can take a ton of time,  but at the moment I'm mostly using them to add colour to pen sketches,  which I can do quite quickly! Painting the whole thing in watercolour takes longer, atleast for me. :)  Vector is basically a different type of graphics! It is basen on paths instead of pixels,  which means a vector drawing can be scaled to any size without lowering the quality.   I use Illustrator,  but it's possible to do in PS too, I've been told. It is a bit tricky to get into the medium I think, but once you so it's very versatile.  There have been a couple of users that have done low poly illustrations (I think that's the name, the style with all the triangels), including /u/metabaron. That's also vector graphics, yes. :)"

ArtistLounge,38xquz,rebelheart,2,Sun Jun 7 19:11:57 2015 UTC,"So this is a great start, you asked for critique and I'm willing to give a little advice. The two biggest places you need to practice is maintaining accurate proportions, and accurately representing value. I'd say you were right in that there is a bit too much contrast in a good deal of the piece. Particularly in the highlights of the hair and the overall value of the skin, there is a bit too much contrast, so the skin looks pretty shiny. One of the easiest ways I have found to perceive overall value is by squinting at both my work and the reference. When you squint, you lose the distracting details and can focus on general value. Turning both your work and the reference upside down can also help a lot, because a nose will look less like a nose and more like the value shapes that you are drawing.  As far as the proportion, I overlaid the reference over the drawing to take a look, and the overall shapes are pretty accurate, as a whole you got the shape of the head, hair and shoulders pretty spot on. Where things started to get a bit skewed is a lot of the features of the face are improperly placed or tilted. Using a grid can help, but it can also become a crutch. There are plenty of schools of thought regarding measurements and proportion, it can be the toughest nut to crack, but accurate proportion in a portrait is the most important step. If you have any other questions, let me know and I'd love to address them. You have some great fundamentals to build on and I definitely reccomend keep doing portraits!"
ArtistLounge,38xquz,JaredSellers,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:56:08 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! I usually don't notice where I went wrong with proportions and angles until it's too late and I've already put lots of detail in, and then it's hard to erase everything and do it all over. I should try to get this right from the start."
ArtistLounge,38xquz,slam_nine,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:52:24 2015 UTC,"Hey, I have a small tip for that. Look your picture in the mirror every now and then while you are drawing. I tend to draw faces a little skewed, and it's much easier to spot it in mirrored picture."
ArtistLounge,38xquz,Talono,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:54:28 2015 UTC,"I'll try that, thanks!"
ArtistLounge,38xquz,mindivy,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:08:59 2015 UTC,"Took me a few days and I guess no one will see it in the original thread, but I'd like to hear opinions on this. So I guess one problem I have - besides from needing so effing long for one piece -  is that my faces end up too round :/ I'm starting to think that maybe I should go back to using grids or something.     I also really struggled with the nose and lips. Do you think there is in general too much contrast? I'm wondering whether I use too much chalk. It looks okish from maybe a meter away but when you get close enough to see the grain of the paper it's not so nice anymore. Should I use paper that is more smooth? Though I don't know how people get charcoal to actually stick to smooth paper."
ArtistLounge,38xquz,mindivy,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:12:53 2015 UTC,"You might be able to get a smoother finish with blending stumps (tortillions).  Don't put the light so close when you take the picture; it makes it harder to see the light greys because the bright light washes them out.   You probably see too much contrast because your values are off. If you desaturate and invert the values of both your image and the source, you'll notice that the lightest point in the source is the tip of the nose and the highest point of the right cheek. On yours, it is the brow and the whites of the eyes (possibly because you put the light so close to the paper xP). http://i.imgur.com/HVSLEpe.png"
ArtistLounge,38xquz,blazing_ent,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:18:46 2015 UTC,I am using stumps. Maybe I'm using them wrong? Thank you so much for that comparison picture! That makes it so much easier to see. I'm drawing from a tablet and just having the two pictures side by side at the same size makes it so obvious what's wrong. :X
ArtistLounge,38xquz,blazing_ent,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:59:01 2015 UTC,"Your technique is good, you have a good grasp of the medium. Spend some quality time with an anatomy for artists book, or just lift some images of bone, musculature so that you can intellectualize the underlying structures of the features. I think this might help your nose/lips struggle, especially with this challenging pose.  Another thing you might try is using a less malleable medium like wax pencil or ink. When I was maining vine charcoal, using wax pencil helped my decision making process because I couldn't just keep pushing the medium around until it looked right, I had to get my structures right the first time."
ArtistLounge,38xquz,autowikibot,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:12:54 2015 UTC,You think that might help? I think I might easily get frustrated when I still make mistakes but then can't fix them :(

ArtistLounge,38nx6f,Doctor_SKY,3,Fri Jun 5 16:02:36 2015 UTC,I got accepted to UAL Camberwell for BA Illustration but went and did Art History/Archaeology/Anthropology BA instead. Sort of regret it because I would have really enjoyed it but it wasn't what I wanted a career out of and it's a lot of money to spend on something that ultimately wouldn't lead anywhere professionaly for me.
ArtistLounge,38nx6f,BaconPancakes1,3,Fri Jun 5 14:50:04 2015 UTC,"I have a double-major BFA in photography/illustration from a private fine art college. I started a design/photography studio while I was still in school and ended up doing all of the graphic design work, which led me to magazine art direction, which I still do.  For a good chunk of my career, I didn't do photography or illustration, so in that regard, art school may have seemed like a waste. I'm not sure I would have gotten where I am without it, though. Having a BFA has certainly helped, but I suspect a cheaper state school degree would have sufficed. The yearly tuition of the school I went to was just too much, considering ROI (about $35k a year now + living and material expenses.)  Looking back, the illustration focus was worthless. The curriculum focus taught mostly the business of illustration (i.e. how to approach editorial or advertising illustraion), rather than teaching the students how to paint/draw. If I could re-do it, I'd just switch to a painting focus.  So, for me ... mostly worth it. I did meet my wife at art school, though. That part was definitely worth it!"
ArtistLounge,38nx6f,dead_painter,2,Fri Jun 5 16:50:28 2015 UTC,"Would it be worth it to self educate on the business aspect of illustration? I'm assuming it's in part worthless because it didn't give you many contacts in the illustration and advertising, correct? Sometimes networking is key in those type of things."
ArtistLounge,38nx6f,sammers092,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:58:41 2015 UTC,"Oh yes. I'm not saying that the business side of illustration itself is 'worthless'. It's always important to network and to learn how to sell your work.   The school, however, tended to offer classes focused on different types of illustration, and then have the students produce works that fit that genre. There's nothing inherently wrong with that, of course, it just didn't fit what I was looking for. I wanted to draw and paint, and learn how to use specific mediums, rather than working in a particular style.  A course or two about 'the business of art' in each major focus would probably have been enough, especially if those courses included actual networking opportunities."
ArtistLounge,38nx6f,dead_painter,3,Fri Jun 5 17:22:17 2015 UTC,"I wanted to go to art school but my parents wouldn't let me (wasn't their money, but that's another story). I did an individualized major in International Relations / poli sci instead. I graduated with a BA.  The entire time I was at university, I was constantly taking art classes. All my friends were art students. I had a studio, art professor mentors, multiple grants for art projects, and was even allowed to participate in the final senior showcase. So in the end, I got the experience of an art major, but a BA instead of a BFA. And I have a full scholarship to work on a graphic novel next year in Ireland while I pursue an MA in Writing.  So, although sometimes I wish I could have gone to a top art school, I don't regret it. Art is a lifestyle choice. I anticipate missing the studio setting, but me and my friends set up a facebook group where someone is scheduled to post art for critique every week."
ArtistLounge,38nx6f,ArtFriend,2,Fri Jun 5 17:14:21 2015 UTC,"Funisher would have something to say about this, but he's on vacation. My situation might apply. I have an MFA in creative writing. After my degree I landed a couple different writing jobs (instructional designer, product copywriter), but then moved to the bay area. I am a bartender now. In Utah, writing jobs didn't pay shit. Out here they pay better, but it can be really difficult to get a job (particularly with no network). I would say that grad school trained me to be better at the craft of my art, but that in no way has helped me occupationally.  My fiance got her MFA and would completely disagree with me. She is director of social media for a company. She loved the time she spent in grad school and writing well has provided her great job opportunities.  TLDR Grad/art school can be a coin toss in terms of helping your career.  Fun fact: Next week a friend of mine is doing a reading in the Bay Area for a book he started our first year in grad school. Last year I self published the book I started at that same time period (2005). So, basically, something as dumb as writing a book took us 9-10 years. Maybe in the long run we will see some rewards."
ArtistLounge,38nx6f,laststarwriter,2,Fri Jun 5 15:13:56 2015 UTC,"I took a year of art school before leaving. I think if I hadn't taken the drawing, design, and painting basics classes I wouldn't nearly be where I am today. There's something about getting that professional level of teaching that you can't find on YouTube, and I had the greatest teachers. Sadly, living in the Third Ward in Milwaukee while going to MIAD got ridiculously expensive and I had to move back home. Still, now it's easier to teach myself because I know how my old instructors will have taught the materials, and I can skip straight past the old ""How to draw realistic animals"" tutorials and go straight for what I want to do."
ArtistLounge,38nx6f,sammers092,2,Fri Jun 5 16:33:00 2015 UTC,"Late to the party, but just saw this thread and thought it was super interesting to read other people's paths, so here's mine:  When I was a kid (maybe nine or ten) I took a drawing class. In high school I had to decide between music and art, and chose music. In college, I went to a big public school that didn't have an art minor and did not allow non-art majors to take any art classes (which was very disappointing.) I wasn't ready to commit to art at the level required for a major, so I majored in Literature.  After I graduated, I kept wanting to take art classes, but money was very tight and I never made it happen.   Then, about four years ago, I was in a seminar and doodling, and the instructor saw my doodles and told me I had a gift. I laughed it off, but I think on some level it affected me because I impulsively bought a book a few months later about drawing portraits, and started trying to make time for it. At the time, I had a baby, so I probably only spent about ten hours total that year drawing, but I was putting some time in and focusing on improving and learning, and I got to see it making a difference. A few years ago, my mother gave me a birthday present of a life drawing course, and the child care to allow me to attend. It was an amazingly generous gift.  As my kids have gotten older, I have been able to find more time to draw; RGD has helped keep me motivated, and the other artists on the site inspire me to try new things and keep working.  All in all, sometimes I wish I could have gone or could go to art school, but I think that, if I keep myself motivated, watching videos, reading books, and practicing, practicing, practicing, I can give myself something that feels meaningful.  tl;dr: I didn't, and it might have been useful, but I'm trying to do it on my own."
ArtistLounge,38nx6f,k0nundrum,3,Tue Jun 9 05:02:20 2015 UTC,"I didn't, but I have three employees, and they all have art degrees. One is from a public university in Washington, and two have degrees from a respected private collage. For me the degree was a soft requirement for the job, but not because I thought the knowledge from the university was necessary, but I wanted to see the commitment that comes with getting a degree. That being said, I would have gone with someone without a degree if they had strong skills.   College tuition is too much, and I do see those working from me strapped with student loans. It's pathetic and criminal. The schools charge too much, and I see the quality of instruction going down fast. The problem is, and I'm sure you're all aware of the catch 22 - a degree doesn't guarantee you a job anymore, but not having a degree pretty much assures you won't get a job. As you move on in life, even if you got a job without a degree, it seems to be those with degrees that get promoted. And the larger the company you work for, the more that holds true. They want credentials. Not some fly by night online school credentials, but real ones.   What you get from a university or college that you don't get online is lots of time with your peers. Lots of bonding time with like minded individuals that form bonds, and help you understand where you want to go and how to get there. Your peers will often teach you more than your teachers, and online you don't have peers in the same way you do in person.   That being said, I've seen, known, and worked with a lot of people with art degrees, and it's a mixed bag. Most will tell you they're glad they did it, and they got a lot out of it, even if the shortcomings are obvious.   I think the most important observation I've made is that it's up to the individual to seek out knowledge and become an expert at what you do. If you think you can just go through school, do what you're told, do well, and graduate with all the skills you need, then you'll be mediocre. You still need to go online to places like lynda.com and soak up the tutorials on photoshop, illustrator and other tools until you become the expert. Those classes in college only provide a foundation knowledge - it's up to you to go further. It's up to you to learn color theory, how to paint, play with different mediums, learn to draw, composition etc. Those college courses will give you the piece of paper, but only you can really get the knowledge.   If you think a course is stupid, do the work and get the grade, but do what you think is un-stupid. For example, if you're told to draw only black and white busts for a year, and you think you should be painting red dragons, then do the course work. Politely disagree with the teacher, but then drop the argument and do the black and white busts. But go home and paint red dragons until the sun comes up.   Ultimately you're responsible for your own destiny. This is especially true now that many art schools aren't even teaching art anymore! They're teaching art theory or some shit. We have entire graduating classes that don't know how to draw, or don't know digital tools. But overall, again, much of what you get out of college will be from your peers, not the teachers. What you'll get from the school is a piece of paper that you can put on your resume. That's only your ticket to get in the door. It's your skills, passion and dedication that will make your ultimate success."

I've seen a few people on reddit subs who started super late in life but started blowing people away really fast due to their intense focus and drive to learn.  Art school is a tool, and it can definitely be effective or ineffective depending on the artist / school / circumstances.  I sometimes wish I'd taken formal art training, but after talking to people who have done it I'm not sure it would have been worth the tuition cost.  BTW Seattle/Bellevue area high-five!"
ArtistLounge,38nx6f,follymiser,2,Fri Jun 5 18:26:28 2015 UTC,"Art school, no... I only took some drawing classes at post-secondary level and those two instructors changed my life forever.  I wish I could have fit some painting classes in but at the time it just wasn't possible in order to finish my non-art related degree.   Looking back, I have mixed feelings about not going to art school... could of been further off in terms of skill, or maybe end up brainwashed as some contemporary art hipster? Millions of ""what-ifs"" come to mind but I don't believe I would be as passionate about art as I am today had I actually gone.   Anyways, apart from those classes and taking art as a kid I would say I'm mostly self-taught. Maybe I'll take a painting class one day but I feel I'm still making good progress on my own."

I learned about the business of being an artist, technical skills on a wide variety of tools I had never even touched before, ideation and process skills, and how to give and take critique. I also built an impressive portfolio of work.  All that said, the experience was not worth a quarter million. The only way I was able to consider throwing four years of my adult life into it was because you fine tax payers footed the bill.  Thanks,  tax payers!

ArtistLounge,38mz73,Quillworth,17,Fri Jun 5 06:58:49 2015 UTC,"You should never feel bad about using reference!   When old master painted a human face, they didn't worked from their imagination but had a model in front of them. When Disney animators create a movie with an animal, they go study real life animals. When a concept artist must create a futuristic vehicle, he will take real-life reference of various existing elements to help him create something believable.  The concept that reference are bad and you have to create everything from your brain is a ridiculous idea that is detrimental to new artist: how can you draw a realistic human body if you don't study the human body while watching real human body? you'll only draw it wrong and get better at being wrong if you persist that way.The only people who think that using reference is bad are people that have never painted seriously or some modern art lovers who think that drawing a square without reference is somehow more meaningful that trying to capture the beauty of a landscape.  So in the end:  use references and be proud of it! just realise that they are 'only' reference and you still have the opportunity (and the duty) to make your painting even better."

ArtistLounge,38mz73,zzappe,6,Fri Jun 5 14:00:52 2015 UTC,Draw more from refference! The more the better. Drawing from real life expands your visual memory making it easier to draw without refference later. I would say that you MUST draw from refference to develop as an artist.

ArtistLounge,38mz73,sgt_mary_mary,3,Fri Jun 5 08:46:36 2015 UTC,"Excuse me for the rant now, but I belive that learning to draw, from real life, is to learn to see.  TL;DR: You don't actuallt now what stuff looks like you just recognise it when you see it. Drawing from refference increases your knowledge and visual memory making it easier to draw good looking things from your head.  Like if you try to draw a horse from your mind you will probably (if not very experienced) not come out with an exact copy of an horse. The reason i belive is that we originally don't know what a horse looks like. We just recognise them when we see one.  If you look yourself in the mirror you will recognise that it is you who stares back at you. But if you sit down and try to draw yourself from your visual memory you will soon encounter problems. ""What shape is my face? Does my nose point uppwards or downwards? How does the wrinkles on my eyelids look? What is the shape of my eyes?""... and so on. You'll realise that you don't know what you look like you just recognize yourself in the mirror.  But by drawing from refference you start to learn what a face look like, or a horse. And with practise it will get easier and easier to draw things from your mind. Your visual library gets bigger.  Excuse me for the rant and have a great day! :D"

There is no such thing as ""too much reference"" when making a piece of art.  Even if you straight up trace something, as long as you are honest about that fact, it is still not too much. So much goes in to the process of making a piece of art beyond just depicting whatever object/scene/etc.  Choices about composistion, color, line, media, the presence of your hand vs another person's, all of this add up to make it your own.  Just look at any of those art and wine painting group shots. They are all making the same thing and told how to do it the same way, but what a difference.  You should never feel guilty or unauthentic about using references but all else fails just follow Jasper John's advice and ""Take an object. Do something to it. Do something else to it."""

I wish I had changed my mindset earlier, rather than waiting for twenty years... I would be a much more accomplished artist at this point.

I'll set aside the fact that it's called digital painting, not digital oil painting, since others have mentioned it. Instead I'll focus on this particular point.  You say ""industry,"" but there are numerous industries that are relevant here.   Fine art, where at least from what I've seen and heard, the physical, unique piece is the primary product, with reproduction being a lesser priority Illustration, where the image itself is important, and reproduction is the priority, with the existence of an individual, unique item being less relevant   When it comes to fine art, sure - digital painting probably isn't as common or as valuable, and when you're speaking to a gallery director or a collector, painting strictly refers to a physical piece that has been produced through traditional means. You'd look silly if you presented a collector with a digital file, or even a digital painting printed onto canvas, claiming it to be an original painting.  When we're speaking in terms of illustration however, our terminology begins to relate more to the style of the finished piece rather than the approach in producing it. Often achieving a certain style does require the use of a particular medium, but not always. Painting becomes an umbrella term for a set of visual styles.  It would very much do an illustrator a disservice to disregard the validity of the term ""digital painting"" - a term that is used daily in exchanges between clients, art directors and artists."

ArtistLounge,38igai,AGamerDraws,2,Thu Jun 4 19:07:26 2015 UTC,"Oil paint, because of the endless combinations of colors and textures that you can get from them and solvents, thinners. Also, I love drawing with a pen, the cheapest the better. There is something really challenging about knowing that when you draw a line, there's no way back."
ArtistLounge,38igai,WaarIsDeSol,4,Thu Jun 4 19:21:48 2015 UTC,"Fineliner pens and brush pens. I like how expressive ink lines can be, and pens are quick, portable, and don't smudge (as long as I remember to let them dry for a second).   I really want to try casein and/or gouache. Both look like they'd be fun for plein air stuff, but since I've never used either it's hard to justify buying a set to test them out."
ArtistLounge,38igai,ThisIsTheSameDog,2,Fri Jun 5 01:19:27 2015 UTC,"I'd just buy a basic children's set of gouache to give it a try and see how it feels - it's really not expensive. You can always switch to the designers' quality later - with the advantage that you will know by then which colours you like to use. Only make sure that you get proper quality white and black from the beginning, or you will get very frustrated. ;) As for working plein air: be aware that gouache is speed paint, it dries super quickly. I've never used them outside, but my guess is, with just a light breeze, the working time would be extremely short. Apparently, you can get some sort of additive though, that makes the working time longer - but I've never tried it. I'd say: go for it. ;)"
ArtistLounge,38igai,adillac,1 point,Sun Jun 7 07:24:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info! I think I'll look into getting a basic starter set. I'm open to brand suggestions if you've got any.  Would you say gouache has a faster or slower drying time than acrylics? I've liked using acrylics in the past because of that fast drying time, and for outdoor painting it's nice to be able to pack up pretty quickly without getting wet paint on everything."
ArtistLounge,38igai,ThisIsTheSameDog,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:56:08 2015 UTC,"Well, I dunno where in the world you are - I'm in europe, I'm only a hobbyist, and I use mostly Talens (dutch make, I'm not sure where in the world it is available.) I have switched to designer's quality now, as they do give better coverage. But I'm still using up my old kiddies' paint pots though. ;)     As for the difference with acrylics.... I've only ever tried acrylics once... heh... so I'm no specialist. But my guess is that gouache dries a lot faster (depending on how much water you use, of course, but I like the thick, opaque colouring that gouache gives, I hardly ever use it as ""watercolour""). For example, I find it pretty hard to mix the colours on the paper - usually, by the time I've taken my second colour, the first one is too dry to pull open. :-/ F.ex., this was one of my very first RGD's, and I had one hell of a time doing the spines on the sweet chestnut. I wanted to drybrush it, but the gouache dried too quickly, and no paint came off the brush. xD If I put more paint or more water on the brush, it just became a nice, opaque smear. Which I didn't want. So I ended up having to mix the gouache with watercolour, to give it more open time. So: very quick. ;) Have fun, and let us know how you're getting on!"
ArtistLounge,38igai,adillac,4,Mon Jun 8 06:13:57 2015 UTC,watercolors probably.  they have so much capability and range.  and i just love watching them flow while i work.  i would like to try oil paints one day. i don't really have a proper set-up for it currently.
ArtistLounge,38igai,poledra,3,Fri Jun 5 04:14:04 2015 UTC,"I bounce between watercolors, watered down gouache, acrylic paint, colored pencil, marker and digital painting. i've also had a thing for linoleum and block printing for a bit before, and used oils for my college thesis. I tried spray paint before, but I just can't get a good control of it. I think I have art medium ADD 8T someday i'd like to try wood burning, or wander through a nice art store and find something weird i've never heard of before."

ArtistLounge,38igai,slam_nine,2,Sat Jun 6 12:52:06 2015 UTC,"It is for sure and I too, went down the same path of addiction!  Most of the time I use a bottled ink from kuratake/yasutomo. Green bottle, very dark but has a bit of shellac so have to watch how much I lay down or it gets this bronze sheen. I use this to refill my brush pens.  When I have the time, I make my own with ink stick + grindstone. It's kind of a zen thing to do, feel all relaxed but maybe it's the fumes lol.  What about you?"
ArtistLounge,38igai,somnivision,2,Sat Jun 6 22:38:04 2015 UTC,"I bought a cheap bottle of ink with chinese text on it, but I lost the packaging so I don't even know what I'm using anymore. :D My local art supply shops don't really have regular inks, only  in calligraphy sets or small and expensive bottles of acrylic inks, so I probably need to explore ebay when I run out."

ArtistLounge,389dvt,AGamerDraws,8,Wed Jun 3 13:54:19 2015 UTC,"I don't even know what that means.   Digital oil painting   I paint in oils, and I do digital stuff on occasion for fun, and there's no comparison between the two. It's like putting an orange under a duck and calling it a Chevy pickup truck.  There may be filters and programs that mimic how oil paint might behave, but you can't get the same color luminosity from a print that you can get with layering of oil pigments. It's something that can only be created (and seen) in the old school analog way. Photography can't pick it up properly, this is why it's important to see works of art in person.   The only downside I've ever seen with digital work is there's no 'original'. No plate or mold even, just a file. That file will look a little different on  every screen, and can look different depending on the printer, it's settings, and what it's printed on. Even day to day changes in the humidity in the room, the amount of ink in the printer, and using a different batch of paper can slightly change the image in how it's printed.  Once printed though there can be hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands.   The main reason I like old school painting is its technical, you have to understand its chemistry to get it to do what you want. You have to be patient, and work with its limitations. When you're done, there is only one. Yes it can be photographed but there's always something lost.  I like German expressionism. There's this painting by Otto Dix, called the Portrait of the Dancer Anita Berber, painted in 1925 in oil and tempera on plywood, &amp; it's 47 3/8x 25 1/2 inches. I've seen in it books for years. I never thought to see it in person, because the original is in Germany. But I happened to be visiting NYC, and happened to go to the metropolitan museum of art, and they happened to be having a Die Brücke exhibit. There the painting was, huge on the wall, and it glowed. If you look it up online you'll see no photo is the same, because it can't really be photographed in the way your eyes see it. It's like trying to photograph the moon. The camera doesn't see the same things your eyes do (this is why it's better to learn to draw from life than from photos).   Digital stuff can be awesome, but it's not the same animal as traditional painting, and that's ok."

It's misleading to the viewer who can't tell the difference. If it's digital they shouldn't call it something else"
ArtistLounge,389dvt,JustToLurkArt,3,Wed Jun 3 00:54:03 2015 UTC,"Digital artists create digital art. Full stop. No oil or paint is involved. To argue otherwise only makes you appear small and takes away from your argument. No one said its inferior and digital art is entirely legit. You're being overly sensitive and defensive. A child recognizes there's no oil or paint involved in digital art. Digital art stands just fine on its own, but its proponents must get past trying to borrow the respectability and tradition of oil painting."
ArtistLounge,389dvt,JustToLurkArt,2,Wed Jun 3 03:26:52 2015 UTC,"Digital painting artists don't have to borrow (a very condescending term you used there) the ""respectability"" and ""tradition"" of oil painting (elitist terms right here).   You’re right they don’t; yet you insist on it. You are hi-jacking the standard terminology used to describe a time-honored medium and applying to a digital format. Specific terms are used in the art industry to categorize artwork. A collector who purchases an oil painting rightly has the expectation of hanging a physical piece of artwork on a nail that was created using oil paint on a substrate. That’s why it’s so vital to use correct industry terminology.   … digital painting artists are traditional painting artists in the natural evolution of art history. A digital oil painting is an oil painting.   Writing it over and over won’t make digital art the same as oil painting.   It is an oil painting in terms of skill and efforts the artist puts forth to create it and it has the same emotional and artistic effect and value it has on the audience.    No one is saying digital art doesn’t take skill and effort or that it doesn’t evoke emotion. Drawings take skill and effort and can have the same emotional and artistic effect and value but no one in their right mind calls them oil paintings. You’re confusing the elements & principles of art with the industry standard description of the medium used to create it.   I can not help but feel sensitive when almost everyday in every art-related subs there are always some traditional artists posted that they want to throat punch digital artists just for using the term ""painting"" to describe their works.   Then use proper industry terminology and don’t project your insecurity onto others.   I almost have never read a comment whereby digital artists attacked and insulted the traditional artists …   I just read some pretty aggressive attacks in your comments in this thread (e.g. “I find this elitist statement very aggressive, divisive, condescending and arrogant.”) and you accused me of being condescending and an elitist. Use correct industry terms and no one will challenge you.  My friend, oil painting has been around for a long time. In it’s plainest definition it’s a process of painting with pigments that are bound with a medium of drying oil and applied on various substrates. That does not describe digital art.  Bottom line: respect is earned – not borrowed. If you want the digital medium to be respected, the use correct industry terminology and start earning the respect of your peers."

ArtistLounge,3885s8,ItWillBeMine,10,Tue Jun 2 15:16:58 2015 UTC,"I often think about talent, especially after the ""10000-hours makes you a pro""-thing. I think ""talent"" is a proper mix of several things inside of you that work together to make you excel in something you for some reason have feelings for. For some reason it's almost never just a single thing, like making money or just wanting to be an artist but an intricate cocktail of fascination, sentimentality, love, hate, curiosity, expression, be seen, get acknowledgement etc. Some points I've noticed is important:   Having an inner critic The ability calm the critic The ability to analyze both the big picture and the small details of the thing you aspire to be able to do. Curiousity as to what knowledge you need to study to gain insight of the ability you want to be better at. Distance both literally (stepping back from your creation, squinting etc) and figuratively (painting your loved ones is a pain, almost impossible). The distance makes your inner critic less interested/less disruptive and also makes it easier for you to analyze what the hell is going on. Practice intelligently. Instead of just churning out a piece a day to magically get better you pinpoint one single thing that you have seen in some other work you love and the focus on that single thing in your next piece. All the pieces you will want to do will be just like churning out pieces anyway. Give yourself credit when you have managed to get better at that single thing and tell your inner critic to fuck off when it points out all the other mistakes. Be proud that you managed to make progress in what you set out to make progress in. Embrace change and happy little accidents. Perhaps you don't need that perfectly smooth gradient. Perhaps that weird shadow should be there. Know when other viewers don't have a clue that the gradient should be perfectly smooth. If you love something you want to be with it. All the time. Know when to take some time off. Collect the art you love, there are awesome tools for that nowadays (Pinterest, Deviantart etc). Analyze a piece that strike you as awsome and try to figure out the big picture and the details of how it was made, Google can probably give you hints too. Live with that piece, always have it open on your desktop/make it a wallpaper. Try to notice something each time you adore it and see if it's something you can incorporate in your next piece. You really don't need the perfect pencil, paint, studio with the perfect light, a unicorn on your shoulder etc. Some people make mind blowing art with coffe stains. Think about that for a while. You seldom get any better pointing out what is bad with others work. Seeing what makes something good is more important for your own progress, since that is what you should focus on with your own work. If you think something is magically/exceedingly hard you probably need other ways of approaching the subject. The most intelligent people I know always asks questions, not for the sake of making an intelligent question but because of curiosity and wanting to learn/get insight/genuine interest. Ask questions. Embrace failure. What seems to be a failure for you can be magic for others. Some are just incredibly stupid failures. Embrace your stupidity. Fight elitism. Elitism is insecurity and proof of inner critics going haywire - a place where art and happy accidents aren't. Be aware of both sides of the Dunning-Kruger effect."

ArtistLounge,3885s8,Wordshark,4,Tue Jun 16 19:19:46 2015 UTC,"Art is a visual language. To become proficient is to be able to communicate well in whatever your chosen medium is. By communicate, I mean beyond doing something pretty or cute. I mean you have an idea and you can communicate that idea. Also by communicating your idea, I expect that idea to be original, not a recreation of someone else's image.   These 'this is my first drawing!' posts I could give zero fucks over. So what. Come back when your done 20, 50, 100+. Any asshole can do something once, maybe they can do something that's kind of ok, but that doesn't mean anything. To be an artist is to communicate visually, not shit one thing out and glow over the circle jerk of a post because you did a thing once. Like any creative medium there's growth and progression, that's why artists keep making art. The stuff a person writes or makes when their 10 isn't the same as the stuff they write it make when they are 20, 30, 40, 50+. Because they've grown in their perspective, and if they keep making stuff, talented or not they are going to get better.   When I was in college, there were basically two types of students. The ones who had a natural gift, and the ones who worked hard. At the end of my time there, it was the ones who worked hard that succeeded. If a student tried to rely only on their talent but didn't do the work, they suffered. If they didn't learn to work hard they got kicked out.  Maybe they got by doing other stuff, but if you really want to progress as an artist, working on your skills and making a lot of art is the only way. There is no other path to become truly good, no matter what your baseline talent is.   I'll say something else, we all have our artistic inclinations. Some folks have the mind of a technical illustrator, others are good at sculpture. Some are more expressive, others may prefer to work more commercially with the concepts others give them. Part of developing as an artist is to discover what kind of artist you really are. When I first went to college I had my heart set on being a Disney animator (back when they did cell animation in-house). I wanted it SO BAD, but I found after a few years that i would most likely hate that life. I like creating my own work, I'm better when expressing my own ideas. I don't like hyper-competitive environments (which the Disney animation studio was). When I heart wrenchingly gave up and told my advisor I was switching to fine arts she laughed at me and asked me what took me so long to figure it out.    So yeah, experiment with different ideas, colors, mediums, forms. Maybe you're a sculptor, maybe welding is your animal, maybe you have a fantastic sense of color, and your rabbit hole is design and paint, or fabric, or found objects. Art is beyond drawing technically well. There's worlds beyond it really. If you love drawing though, stick with it, and don't worry if their one drawing seems better than what you are doing. That's not what art is about. You keep making stuff, and you'll get there.   Like one of my teachers once said, "" you gotta make a lotta shitty art before you make anything good""."
ArtistLounge,3885s8,Fey_fox,2,Tue Jun 2 22:22:46 2015 UTC,"I liken talent being the style and flair of your art. The you that comes through and speaks to someone. That's your talent. Your ability determines how well you execute your talent. Shitty art can have a great message, that art would have a very talented artist to convey that. Whereas you can have someone able to create awesome art, but there's no message, no flair, and while it looks great it's lacking direction and could be easily duplicated by any number of artists.  I think of it like someone who went to art school but still isn't really good (has the ability) vs someone who makes something of their ability, like selling paintings at a gallery, recognition, experience, wisdom, etc. They have combined the ability with their talent for it to do something more than just make things that look nice."
ArtistLounge,3885s8,jarwastudios,2,Tue Jun 2 17:35:18 2015 UTC,"Take what I say with a grain of salt cause I'm new to both this sub and to drawing and posting my stuff but I think a lot of those ""my first drawing ever"" people may just have different definitions of ""first"". Do they mean my first drawing that they're willing to show to people and they've actually got tons of practice on side that they never showed off?   Speaking of the talent issue, I used to be a teaching assistant for some science courses in undergrad and definitely there were people who learned the concepts much faster and better than others. In most of the people I taught, there was a reason for it, some didn't care how well they did, others were clearly actually bothering to study, but there were a distinct few who managed to put very little effort in and still get decent grades. Or people who studied less than the others but got the same grades. To me that's what talent is, it's how fast and comprehensively you can learn a concept. Someone with a low level of talent, if they have the will to, can still learn the concept they'll just take longer than a person with talent. And of course a person with talent still needs practice to be good.  Speaking as a very new artist, I don't think about talent that much. I don't think I'm skilled enough to be worrying about it anyway. I more think in terms of things I don't understand and need to work on."

Thanks for your thoughts!"
ArtistLounge,3885s8,Sweetstreetmeat,2,Tue Jun 2 19:54:10 2015 UTC,"I think it's more of a question as to how we define each of those terms.  I don't think they're interchangeable, and for someone to chide you for associating them with one or the other is... small.  To me, talent (in visual arts) is the difference between looking and seeing.  When you look at something you identify the thing, when you see something you understand the thing.    Same thing with music, you can listen to music or hear music. Same thing with Dance.. or computer programming or cooking.  The better you understand how something works the more ""talented"" you are.    Some people are inherently better at seeing than others.  This doesn't mean someone can't learn how to see, only that it won't come as easily.  Ability - I like to think of this more as how well you can communicate your talent.  Technical skill, if you will.  This is the part that takes a long time to refine.    and what really sucks is when someone has one without the other..."
ArtistLounge,3885s8,eggpl4nt,2,Tue Jun 2 21:36:31 2015 UTC,"It's purely ability, in my opinion. You're not born with talent, nor would you magically wake up one day to have it. You gradually gain bits of ability, be it through learning via observation or practice and encouragement as a child. This ability may or may not increase throughout childhood and adulthood based on continuous observation, praise, and/or practice.  I'll agree that some people catch on better than others. That doesn't mean they have talent, they just simply understand and are able to connect with some concepts better. Like I'm shit at math, but slightly less shit at everything else.  ""You have talent"" is sweetened poison - it tastes good, but drink too much and you'll kill yourself."
ArtistLounge,3885s8,dsnr427,3,Wed Jun 3 09:14:36 2015 UTC,"Like anything it's mostly about practice and a culmination of the work your brain was doing behind the scenes. Whether or not you're conscious of said practice is a different story. Some people are able to start at a much higher level than others and while this may be your ""first drawing ever"" you have been observing shapes and textures, developing motor skills and dexterity your whole life.   I just started learning guitar and while I have never played I have been listening to music and watching people play heavily for like 25 years now. All that has to have influenced my ability in some way compared to someone who has never heard music, if that's even possible. Though I think genetics play a bigger factor in creating music on some instruments, my short fingers have never given me problems drawing that I am aware of."
ArtistLounge,3885s8,darktalonblood,2,Tue Jun 2 16:10:49 2015 UTC,"I think talent matter, a lot, but it's a somewhat intangible factor. Some people work hard to succeed at their goals, and from their point of view, talent it's not as important as all the effort they made to be good at their trade. And they are proud about it, and that's a good thing. But looking a the bigger picture, talent it's one of those attributes or advantages that sometimes work in our favor. Like, some times being able to have time to paint or being able to buy the utensils it's something that we take for granted. And talent can be overlooked the same way. If talent, the innate ability to be good at some skill, didn't mattered, we all would start at the same base level of skill and we would all level up to the same level with the same quantity of work. And in practice we can easily see that it's not the case. That said, working hard always* beats talent. TL;DR:When someone compliments your talent, say ""Thanks!"" *Not always :("
ArtistLounge,3885s8,AGamerDraws,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:59:07 2015 UTC,"I believe in skills and abilities over talent. I do think that some people learn at a faster rate, but they are learning none-the-less. No-one falls over and accidentally paints a da-vinci, they study and hone their skills.  I was always told as a kid that I was talented. I was in gifted and talented groups and winning awards all through my school years. But I wasn't talented, or special. I didn't wake up one day and suddenly have the ability to draw. I worked really, freaking hard. I sat in my room every weekend with papers all over the floor, studying a new subject from a nature book. I looked out the window and sketched the birds during class. I watched the little quirks of the people around me, how they stood and how they acted and turned them into cartoons and comics. When I ran out of paper I started drawing up my arm until I looked like I worked at a tattoo parlour. I loved every second at it and I started off just as awful as everyone else starts. Some people don't believe me about that last part, but it's true. I started by scribbling on paper and exclaiming ""mummy I drew you!"" when it looked more like a mix between Micky Mouse and a tornado haha! I wasn't talented, it's just art was me. It's the biggest love in my life and it will always be that way. So that's why I worked and still do work so hard.  I still have a very very long way to go before I will be happy with my own work. Sometimes it feels like i'm only just starting. But it's been a long road, and not once in any of that time was the skill to draw gifted to me.   I think the reason we see the occasional artist show up showing amazing work as their ""first drawings"" is because they have been learning in other ways. They've studied the world around them, they know what looks good and what looks bad and they've clearly had an interest in art so it's sunk in. You can always see the mistakes, the things that show they really are early in their skill, but yes it does look amazing, but I wouldn't equate it to some mystical gift that they were born with.  I think something important to remember is that you barely ever see the artists ""working out"". You don't see their bin full off thrown away concepts or the time they sat down and tried to figure out how exactly a nose is shaped. All you see is that amazing piece in front of you, and you don't even know how long it took to make or all the mistakes they had to overcome making it. Art is a journey and a process, that's what it will always be to me."

ArtistLounge,384b6o,sgt_mary_mary,2,Mon Jun 1 19:27:05 2015 UTC,"I've been trying to learn how to draw freehand in Illustrator using my tablet. While I do like the look of these, I don't feel like I have full control over what I'm doing. The shapes rarely show up on the screen in the way I intended... Perhaps there are some settings (either for the tablet itself, or in Illustrator?) that I should fiddle with?"
ArtistLounge,384b6o,Sweetstreetmeat,2,Mon Jun 1 19:33:24 2015 UTC,"These are gorgeous.  The Window is probably my favourite.   I'm not sure which tools you're using for these, but in my experience, there are 3 tools which you would benefit by learning (if you're not already using them) :  Paintbrush Tool (B) : This tool lays down lines;  you can assign the usual preferences, opacity, colour etc.  Each line can then be customized however you want with you selection tool and direct selection tools.  The neat thing about this tool is you can apply brush definition which will change the appearance of the line.  (you can download further brush packs or create your own if you're looking for specific styles) -by double clicking the icon you can modify the fidelity and smoothness of the brush (stability).  This might be the issue you're having with the the shapes not coming out the way you want.  I would highly recommend setting both values to 0 and then working upwards to something that feels right to you.    Blob Brush Tool (Shift-B) : This tool lays down shapes; you can assign the usual preferences, opacity, colour etc.  Each shape can then be customized however you want with you selection tool and direct selection tools.  -as with the Paintbrush tool, by double clicking the icon you can modify the fidelity and smoothness of the brush (stability).   Again, I would highly recommend setting both values to 0 and then working upwards to something that feels right to you.  You can also manually modify the appearance of the brush (roundness and angle).  When painting with this tool any shape you lay down will merge naturally with any other shape of the same colour, on the same layer.  Pen Tool (P) : This tool can lay down both lines and shapes; This should become your go-to tool for any specific shapes.  If you're unfamiliar with the way it works it may take a while to get used to, there's a bit of a learning curve.  This is probably the furthest thing away from freehand, but your best bet at getting exact shapes.  The big plus to this tool is that once you get used to it, Photoshop has an almost exact (with a few minor changes) tool which can be extremely helpful at creating custom shapes or selections.   If you've laid down a shape (or a line) that isn't quite right, you can always use the direct selection tool (A) to modify individual anchor points in the shape.   You can click on any individual anchor point or select a group of anchor points to move about.    If you've laid down a shape (or a line) and you want to add additional anchor points you can select the Pen Tool (P) and click anywhere on the edge of the shape.  You can also set an anchor point to a hard corner or smooth through the onscreen banner menu at the top.  Adjusting the handles on the anchor point will let you customize the rounded edges on your shapes.   I'm not sure at what level you're at with Illustrator, so I apologize if all this is too basic and already known.  I found Illustrator extremely frustrating trying to learn.  Hope this helps."
ArtistLounge,384b6o,Sweetstreetmeat,2,Mon Jun 1 23:18:08 2015 UTC,"It definitely helps! I had no idea about the blob brush tool, but I expect I will be using that quite a bit now. Also wasn't aware I could download brushes for Illustrator,  so that's great to know. I haven't been using lines  at all for these,  just shapes,  but it's something I want to explore.   Most of all, thanks for pointing me to the fidelity settings!  I believe that has been the source of some of my issues.  Thank you so much for the help, and for the nice words.   Edit: Been trying the blob tool a bit, and I love it. Yay!"

ArtistLounge,384b6o,Sweetstreetmeat,2,Tue Jun 2 09:44:13 2015 UTC,"Even though Illustrator is vastly superior for that kind of stuff I do all my vector pieces in Photoshop nowadays.  To me the most important setting is the ""Curve Fit"" when drawing free hand (called FreeForm Pentool in PS as opposed to the bezier curve PenTool) which tells the program how smooth you want your lines. The lower the number the more the line will retain its original, drawn shape. If you set that number to 9 or 10 the lines will come out so smooth you'll barely recognize them, which can be useful and fun in some instances - it gives a very stylized look to the drawing. You can mix and match freeform with bezier curves within the same path, by the way.   Sorry if this is not really relevant to your case, but it's the only thing I can think of at the moment that could help you have better control over vector lines and shapes.    /u/Sweetstreetmeat's post was so good and detailed it made me want to start using Illustrator again, but I don't have access to that program at the moment. Edit: some grammar and typos."

The last most influential artist was Helen Van Wyk"
ArtistLounge,37us3f,the-tinidril,2,Sun May 31 09:30:44 2015 UTC,"It's hard not to love Van Gogh, I think. Once you see his stuff live, that is. I saw one of his works in Italy and it just... They're so much... more in person. Pictures don't do the paintings justice.  I never thought I'd understand Jackson Pollock until I saw his paintings live, either. Splashes of dirt and muddy paint on a canvas? How could anyone consider that art? Then I saw his work in person, and listened to the tour, and I have to say, I started to like Pollock's work a lot more.  Art is awesome."

I just feel like her art captures the emotion of wonder and awe, and also the need when you are young to go out and fix the world. My favourite thing about her work is how she can make an image look messy and polished at the same time.  A close second would be the stunning work of wlop who combines effortless thick brushstrokes with delicate airbrushed faces to add so much energy.  I will always have respect and admiration for the old masters, but it's work like this that stays with me."

ArtistLounge,37m2fu,somnivision,2,Thu May 28 16:46:53 2015 UTC,"This is a new-ish painting support I've been trying out. As the title says, yep it's actually made of limestone and is more stable than wood pulp papers when wet - hardly any buckling and it will flatten out by itself. It's durable and is supposedly archival too - although untested as it's relatively new, I would think that stone will outlast wood pulp papers anyways.  So the surface is quite smooth and has a kind of eggshell texture, similar to synthetic papers (ex. yupo) but less slippery and more eco-friendly. I find that with acrylics and oil it still helps to gesso the surface to give it more tooth. Stands up well to knife painting, solvents, scrubbing, etc. just love this stuff right now. Much more portable and cheaper than artist papers & stretched canvas.   stood up to at least 10 heavy ink washes, no buckling painting directly with oils and solvents, very minor buckling  painting over gessoe with oils and solvents, very minor buckling (still WIP so it's on the easel) thick acrylics + varnish, minor buckling  thin acrylics, no buckling    Not gonna name drop but google ""stone paper"" and you'll find different manufacturers. You'll find that they all talk shit about each other on their own sites but they're essentially all the same.  The only downside is that it's a ""paper"" so marketing your work may somehow seem less valuable to casual buyers. Artworks on canvas typically go for a higher price but maybe these new materials can change the game?"
ArtistLounge,37m2fu,funisher,3,Thu May 28 16:51:43 2015 UTC,This is intriguing medium for sure! Is the surface archival without gesso or would the mineral spirits wear on it over time?
ArtistLounge,37m2fu,funisher,3,Thu May 28 21:34:41 2015 UTC,It hasn't been around long enough to definitely say what the effects are but mineral spirits are typically used on stone surfaces as a cleaning agent. I just know that a turps and linseed oils I've used haven't seeped through and this is a 8 lb. (30 GSM) sheet - about the thickness of newsprint.
ArtistLounge,37m2fu,kyleclements,3,Thu May 28 22:15:27 2015 UTC,"Daaaammnn, now I'm really intrigued! That's nuts"
ArtistLounge,37m2fu,kyleclements,1 point,Thu May 28 22:17:03 2015 UTC,"Stone paper is usually stone dust and HDPE, so it should be super archival in most cases, especially for chemical resistance, but UV exposure will likely be bad, so varnish the hell out of it with UV blocking varnishes."

ArtistLounge,37m2fu,the-tinidril,2,Thu May 28 19:45:35 2015 UTC,"i would try to avoid listing brands but it's hard to describe this material without using the word paper...

ArtistLounge,37n52u,kempsridley,4,Thu May 28 21:19:58 2015 UTC,"Ah, summoned by /u/funisher, hey! =]  I've experienced several injuries to my hand and arm from drawing over the years. Most notably misaligning my spine, severe cramping to the point where my hand wouldn't move the next day and inflamed ligaments from the tip of my pinky finger down my wrist. Because of this I have seen several physicians over the years to correct the damage and teach me how to deal with it properly. All the advice I give here is a combination of what they have tought me and my own experience. Take it with a grain of salt, as I am not medically trained and therefore can only speak from experience.  Firstly, there are important symptoms that you should always look out for. If you get pins and needles in the tips of your fingers and pain/pins and needles located in your thumb speak to a medical professional immediately. Damaging the hand/wrist further can lead to carpel tunnel. Pin pointed pain on joints (such as between the joints in the finger) tends to be inflamed ligaments, which can be easily treated by simply leaving it to rest, or keeping something soft between the inflamed area and your art materials. If you are ever concerned about an injury it is always best to talk to a medical professional before it worsens. My personal favourites have been physiotherapists and osteopaths as they were the best at helping me fix my drawing posture where as doctors simply told me it wasn't broken and to stop irritating it. Do not wear a brace/wrap whilst drawing unless advised to by a professional. In fact, don't wear a brace unless you have actually injured your hand as it can make it worse rather than better.   That brings me onto the second point: posture. Your posture and the amount of pressure you put on your hand is going to be the biggest factor in damaging it. Make sure that you are always sat with your back straight and looking at the artwork at a comfortable, inclined angle. When using a screen tablet this is easy, however other tablets can take a while to get used to. Also remember that you can adjust your sensitivity settings of your tablet so there is no reason to press too hard on the tablet or hold the pen too tight. Because of the lack of tactile feeling between the tablet and hand there can be a tendency to press harder than needed. If you want more of a tactile feeling I have heard that attaching a piece of paper to the tablet can help, although I haven't tried this myself. The most important advice I was given about posture was move the artwork, not your body. Pick up the tablet and turn it, flip and rotate the canvas, whatever you need to do, but ensure that you are still sat in a correct position to ensure there is no unnecessary pressure on your hand/arm/spine.  Yes you should be using your arm and shoulder when working digitally, just as you do with traditional work. Try to figure out what the differences are between your digital and traditional set ups: is it located in a different place, are you sat at a different angle, is the drawing space smaller than normal, does the pen feel too different? etc. Practice trying to create spirals using only your arm/elbow/shoulder. I try to create spirals without letting the lines touch to train myself to create accuracy whilst only using my shoulder. Also try to do a few sketches barely using your wrist. It may be that you just need to work yourself out of the habit. Also pay attention to how much you are zooming in; it's easier to use sweeping movements on a zoomed out canvas.  Hand exercisers can help. Things like the eggserciser have helped me, although you can get by with a putty eraser. It is important to warm up a muscle before using it, this includes your hand. So warm up your fingers, palm and wrist (gently) before starting your normal drawing routine.  Exercises: Here is a link to a guide I made of all the exercises I do to look after my drawing arm. I apologise for any spelling mistakes, it is a fairly old post now.  And finally, if you have someone who can give your arm a massage after a long drawing session then that can really help. And always take regular breaks. A good ratio for breaks is 1 to 2 hours working with 15 to 30 mins resting. It can be easy to just keep drawing, especially if things feel quicker digitally, but breaks are really needed.  Oh and before I forget: do you scroll a lot? Do you scroll through reddit and Facebook when you aren't drawing? Several of my arty friends have discovered that this was damaging their hand as it wasn't getting the breaks it needs. Always be mindful of what your wrist is doing, even when you aren't drawing, to ensure it stays healthy.  I hope this helps and if you have any questions feel free to ask away. =]"

ArtistLounge,37n52u,funisher,2,Thu May 28 23:24:23 2015 UTC,"Haha, that's kind of my little cheat code and probably isn't good for ya. =P"
ArtistLounge,37n52u,AGamerDraws,1 point,Thu May 28 23:25:13 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for taking the time to write this - you are awesome!! This is super helpful and I am going to (and already have) apply some of your tips. Several people in my family have pain issues with their drawing arms so hopefully I can develop some good habits to prevent any troubles.
ArtistLounge,37n52u,AGamerDraws,1 point,Fri May 29 00:04:15 2015 UTC,"One quick question - from your experience, is it better to draw at an angle? Right now my tablet (it is a intuos pro - so no screen) lays flat on the desk and I tend to rest my arm on the desk while I draw which is probably why I rely so heavily on my wrist."
ArtistLounge,37n52u,AGamerDraws,1 point,Fri May 29 00:08:54 2015 UTC,Yes definitely have the tablet at an angle. You want to drawing surface to be parallel with your face/body. Not only is this'd re comfortable but it prevents distortions in your drawings from not seeing the canvas properly. Glad I could help.
ArtistLounge,37n52u,megaswan,1 point,Fri May 29 09:16:35 2015 UTC,thanks again!

ArtistLounge,37jiu3,bluequaker2,1 point,Thu May 28 02:10:50 2015 UTC,that turned out really cool! :D Is it graphite or charcoal?
ArtistLounge,37jiu3,the-tinidril,1 point,Fri May 29 09:51:57 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I appreciate it:) it's a small drawing, all graphite pencil."
ArtistLounge,37jiu3,the-tinidril,1 point,Fri May 29 10:18:55 2015 UTC,You're welcome! I asked because it scanned really well and I have a devil of a time getting graphite to scan decently...
ArtistLounge,37jiu3,the-tinidril,1 point,Fri May 29 18:38:47 2015 UTC,"Oh okay, I have a inexpensive scanner. But the software might make the difference. I use vuesan, and had to play a lot with the settings until I could get a halfway descent image. It's relatively inexpensive. The software is pretty flexible and works with a wide range of scanners. Hope this helps. Best of luck."

ArtistLounge,37hxkc,Nakranoth,3,Wed May 27 19:37:25 2015 UTC,/u/funisher may have some idea about the artist or similar artists. :)-
ArtistLounge,37hxkc,Gaderael,6,Wed May 27 21:00:26 2015 UTC,"Yep! I dont know that artist soecifically but OP definitely should check out Kim Cogan, some Neo Rausch, some David Hockney suburb paintings, and if you want to push some of that raw interior to the max check out some Anselm Keifers! I know there's more but I can't think of them at the moment... :("
ArtistLounge,37hxkc,funisher,3,Wed May 27 21:34:55 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the advice! Do you have any ideas on some affordable suburb/industrial paintings or prints? The poppy colors on both of these paintings would look great in my house.   I wish I could've provided a better picture of the second painting, it had what looked like acrylic marker graffiti a layer or two under the paint."
ArtistLounge,37hxkc,funisher,3,Wed May 27 23:22:07 2015 UTC,"Hmm, to be honest, not really. You could always do some digging on Society6 and Etsy. Etc, there also might be some artists that can do that for you in the /r/redditgetsdrawn artist directory. It's primarily portraits in there but most of those artists have a pretty wide vocabulary in their actual portfolios."
ArtistLounge,37hxkc,MacAnthony,2,Thu May 28 03:57:33 2015 UTC,"I was thinking more Edward Hopper than Hockney, but he came to mind for me too."
ArtistLounge,37hxkc,funisher,2,Thu May 28 15:17:41 2015 UTC,"Oh Jesus, that's right! I forgot about Hopper!"
ArtistLounge,37iiws,JNKill,3,Wed May 27 21:55:12 2015 UTC,Oh shit! All sorts of wild style lines! What mediums are we looking at? :D
ArtistLounge,37iiws,funisher,3,Thu May 28 06:18:48 2015 UTC,"First I gave it a background, graffiti and acrylic, than I started with a pencil drawing (very rough) - just the main person(s). And the rest is filling in the gaps with markers / fineliners... just what came to mind!  So medium.... ehm yeah all of the above!"

ArtistLounge,37hjle,westopher718,1 point,Wed May 27 18:04:24 2015 UTC,Holy smokes; congratulations!!! That has to be an amazing feeling :D How long did it take you to do the cover art?
ArtistLounge,37hjle,follymiser,2,Wed May 27 18:44:58 2015 UTC,"Thank you! It's really cool to know that I'll have some published work. And the story line is actually super interesting. I was worried when I signed on that it would suck if I didn't like the material haha!  Anyway, I think each cover design took 2 to 3 hours. So not terribly long compared to the speech bubbles (~26 hours). :)"
ArtistLounge,37hjle,follymiser,1 point,Wed May 27 19:00:55 2015 UTC,"Oof... that's a lot of bubbling!  What kind of resources do you have/ have you used for the bubbling?  Do you use templates / specific font kits, or something else?"
ArtistLounge,37hjle,follymiser,1 point,Wed May 27 19:34:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah! The whole book was done using Manga Studio 5 (or Clip Studio Paint... same thing). The font is Anime Ace. Once I got the hang of Manga Studio's bubble system, I actually really liked it. You have a lot of control over the different tails (straight line, spline, poly-line) and bubbles (box, ellipse, custom shape, etc).  It took me a while to realize that I could combine bubbles & tails by merging layers haha, but once I did it made everything look SO MUCH nicer than my first few pages!  The only thing that was kind of irritating is that Manga Studio doesn't have a text wrap feature. So you have to manually hit ""enter"" for each new line. It's mostly a pain in the butt if you're copy/pasting something. But I ended up liking it after a while because it gives you more control over the shape of the text."

ArtistLounge,37elet,MaraudingAztec,2,Wed May 27 01:39:05 2015 UTC,"Concept art is essentially visual problem solving.  You start with a problem. Something that requires a design as its solution. Some sort of question or prompt. There's plenty of communities that have weekly or biweekly challenges that provide prompts for fresh designs and also redesigns of existing characters (Conceptart.org's community activities and the Brainstorm Facebook Group come to mind).  Then you look at the tools in your arsenal.  First you've got your fundamentals. It's important to have an understanding of how complex objects are constructed through the combination and intersection of simple forms. I talk about this a lot in my subreddit /r/ArtFundamentals and its sister site, drawabox.com.  Secondly, you've got a visual library. That refers to an area in your mind where you store all the visual and functional information you've ever observed and studied. When you start out, it's pretty empty. Gradually, by doing a lot of analytical observational drawing of.. pretty much anything and everything, it starts to accumulate. I say analytical specifically because it is possible just to copy over reference photos without really understanding the forms that exist within that reference and how they all fit together. It's extremely important to study your subject matter and try to wrap your head around how it all works.  This isn't memorization, really - it's not an active thing. Naturally, when something clicks and you really come to understand how something is constructed, parts of that understanding will embed themselves in your long term memory naturally. Beyond that, what you'll remember will be imperfect. When you use this information you've got tucked away when designing something, you'll pull in little mistakes too, which will likely result in happy accidents.  Another more active approach to this is simply to use reference when drawing things from your imagination. Most designs are something like 70-80% based in real life, with only a small fraction that is more fantastical. It's this grounding in reality that makes designs relatable. Using reference while designing will help you develop your visual library while creating fresh new designs.  Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, get ready to fail. None of this is easy, and none of it comes immediately. You will fail, you will make mistakes, you will produce garbage that will make you feel shame in your very soul. But that's okay."
ArtistLounge,37elet,Uncomfortable,1 point,Wed May 27 13:42:04 2015 UTC,"Words of wisdom! I'm also excited to learn about your drawabox website. This was on the front page:   I feel like if you can understand something, you should be able to construct it, and if you can't construct it, you don't really understand it.   This is something that I've been trying to work on. I know I need a far better grasp of form. And all of that is going to come from understanding anatomy on a higher level."
ArtistLounge,37elet,westopher718,2,Wed May 27 17:30:09 2015 UTC,"This may just be semantics, but I usually look at it as understanding things on a lower level. Rather than thinking about each anatomical component, it tends to help a lot more to think of the masses and forms. Once you have that down, you can start thinking about the different muscle groups that exist, but if you jump straight into that, you'll have no foundation on which to pin this musculature."
ArtistLounge,37elet,Uncomfortable,1 point,Wed May 27 17:35:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that was informative. I looked at r/artfundamentals and its interesting, I might go there more often now that I know it exist."

ArtistLounge,37cjck,follymiser,3,Tue May 26 17:01:50 2015 UTC,Good question...hmmm...I could start typing after I'm done thinking and leave this sentence out...or even delete it once my ideas are collected...I think the first part I think about for the focal point is composition.
ArtistLounge,37cjck,funisher,3,Tue May 26 18:31:06 2015 UTC,"Leave it.  Leave any and all rambling.  NO MISTAKES IN ART, FUN!"
ArtistLounge,37cjck,ZurinP,1 point,Tue May 26 18:34:03 2015 UTC,"Your question reminded me of this video.  Basically the idea is that the main focus is mostly what looks different in the frame, could be that one thing is shaped differently from the other things, like giving it a little more detail on the subject you are trying to focus on; could be that an object has more vivid or contrasted colors compared to other objects surrounding it, but your eyes are most likely to be attracted to what looks different."
ArtistLounge,37cjck,AGamerDraws,1 point,Tue May 26 20:23:18 2015 UTC,"Focal points are definitely something I've learned to try and incorporation over time, but it can be a big struggle.  Do you like to use more color, value, or line weight to denote focus?  Do you typically just pick by feel?"
ArtistLounge,37cjck,AGamerDraws,1 point,Tue May 26 22:07:40 2015 UTC,I like to use borders and flowing shapes that move in the direction I want the eye to go. I'm also currently working on using strong value contrasts in the areas I want to be most interesting.  For black and white sketch/manga work it's line weight and bright spotlights that I focus on.
ArtistLounge,37cjck,AGamerDraws,1 point,Tue May 26 20:33:09 2015 UTC,"I think it's also interesting to see how it works out with different genres, since some things like game art can be very saturated.

ArtistLounge,378dbm,follymiser,2,Mon May 25 23:02:51 2015 UTC,I have a sign up sheet to ensure that I get adaquate breaks. I actually had bookings filled up by 11am on the Sunday (the show only opened at 10!) =]
ArtistLounge,378dbm,follymiser,2,Tue May 26 00:16:48 2015 UTC,"Obviously it varies by the detail/etc. of the drawing, but how long (roughly) did each drawing take?  I take it you had a set number of drawings you would commit to doing (i.e. ""I will only allow up to 20 sign-ups on my sheet"")?"
ArtistLounge,378dbm,Dmunman,2,Tue May 26 17:46:07 2015 UTC,"I have 1 hour slots for each commission. So each piece is created within that time limit.

ArtistLounge,371dfl,funisher,2,Sun May 24 06:28:32 2015 UTC,"Hey man, sorry I didn't get to your reply sooner!  Well, they go on super easy don't leave streaky marks like markers can be prone to do. There is minimal bleed through the paper I was using. I think I laid three or four layers before that happened, and the paper isn't too thick.   Any layer after the initial layer has a very slight spread. Barely noticeable, but it is there. I guess it's just the nature of the marker as they are a little ""watery"" for lack of a better word.   I have no experience with Copics or Prismacolour markers, but they're a lot like the Pantone tri-tip markers that used to be on the market.   Using pencil leads over them works just fine, as does the paint marker that I used for the super white in the picture.   The ones I have are double-tipped, with a medium side and a nice fatty side.   I hope that covers everything."

ArtistLounge,36qmn4,jackjohnbrown,2,Thu May 21 11:47:14 2015 UTC,"Wow! You just took the Graveyard to a new level. How did you even find those?  :D   The drawings look great,  and I'm glad you're enjoying the Graveyard. :)"
ArtistLounge,36qmn4,metabaron,3,Thu May 21 12:31:54 2015 UTC,I was trying to figure out how long RGD had been going and stumbled onto a way to search for posts by date range...seemed like a nice opportunity to surprise some OPs from long ago!
ArtistLounge,36qmn4,jackjohnbrown,2,Thu May 21 13:43:17 2015 UTC,You mean in the advanced search options? Otherwise I'd like to know an easier way to do it myself.
ArtistLounge,36qmn4,metabaron,3,Mon May 25 03:16:14 2015 UTC,We're probably talking about the same thing...searching by timestamp ranges using epochconverter...see the details under Cloudsearch Syntax on the search wiki.
ArtistLounge,36qmn4,jackjohnbrown,2,Mon May 25 03:59:04 2015 UTC,"Ah sorry, I misread your post. I thought you meant there was a way to search for posts with no responses within a time frame, that would be really sweet if possible."
ArtistLounge,36qmn4,metabaron,3,Mon May 25 20:10:58 2015 UTC,"There is, actually! If you do the timestamp trick I mentioned, one of the sorting options (New/Relevance/etc) is Comments. Sort them that way and all the no-comment posts will be at the end of the list."
ArtistLounge,36qmn4,jackjohnbrown,2,Mon May 25 21:20:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I noticed that right after I posted my reply - this is gonna come very handy for GYT's, thanks JJB.   Love your drawings by the way, are they actual vectors? Looks like they were done in Corel Draw, which had both vector and raster capabilities.  I don't even think that program is still around anymore."
ArtistLounge,36qmn4,metabaron,4,Mon May 25 22:37:00 2015 UTC,"My stuff is a mix of things, depending on what kind of look I'm after and whether or not I'm at home—I use mostly Photoshop at home with my MacBook and a Wacom tablet, but also use my iPad mini for vector stuff (Illustrator Draw app) or if I'm away from home without my PS setup (in which case I'll use Procreate). If I'm on the iPad I always use a pressure sensitive stylus from Wacom. Here is a three photo comparison. Then too some of my stuff just feels vector-y because of my sort of flat style, even though it was made in PS. An example or two.  More and more I prefer Photoshop, largely because of the great brushes available—and at the sizes my work is getting printed, being non-vector isn't a deal breaker."
ArtistLounge,36qmn4,tofarawaytimes,2,Tue May 26 01:05:49 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I would have never guessed that some of those pieces weren't vector.  I've just recently started experimenting with brushes myself, it's a totally different ball game from the pen tool in PS and far more intimidating because there are so many more settings to play with, and particularly so when a tablet is also involved.   You style is very fresh and unique, keep at it :) And thank you for the detailed response, I really appreciate it."

ArtistLounge,36qmn4,adillac,5,Sat May 23 09:00:25 2015 UTC,"Hahaha, thanks - I fell off my chair when I saw it had already been done (and so beautifully). Here was me thinking it was old enough! XD It'll take ages for me to finish it, and I haven't even decided on a medium yet... I may do different versions, as it is a great practice  for basic shapes and 3D depth.

ArtistLounge,36o5dg,fivepmsomewhere,3,Wed May 20 20:26:00 2015 UTC,"Whoa, 3'x20' is a lot of art for $1500 (before taxes)."
ArtistLounge,36o5dg,jackjohnbrown,1 point,Thu May 21 13:52:14 2015 UTC,"That is definitely true. I got the impression though that you could submit multiple pieces of artwork to hang on the wall. In that situation, there would be space inbetween the paintings/drawings/prints.  Just to see the breakdown, I thought about what would happen if I submitted 10""x10"" illustrations (prints) for that wall. If I left only 3-4 inches between each piece, with ten pieces submitted, I'd be making $150 per print.   The only real issue I take with this contest is that it decrees submissions as ""work for hire"" products. To summarize the legalize of that:    Under copyright law, as the 'author' of a piece of artwork, you own the copyright EXCEPT in situations of 'work for hire'. The little Beet will own the copyright and be legally considered the author.   I'm pretty sure that means I can't sell the print elsewhere, which would suck. I'm going to send off an email to make sure that's accurate, but that's definitely how they phrase it:   Each Contestant hereby acknowledges that Entry and all other materials of every kind whatsoever created by contestant relating to the Contest (collectively, the “Work”) are a “work made for hire” (as that term is used in the United States Copyright Act) for Sponsor, and assigns to Sponsor (or, if any applicable law prohibits or restricts such assignment, contestant hereby grants to Sponsor an irrevocable, perpetual, royalty-free, transferable license of) limited right, title and interest in and to such Work, including, without limitation, all rights of every kind and nature (whether now known or hereafter devised, including all copyrights therein and thereto and all renewals and extensions thereof), throughout the universe, in perpetuity, for all purposes, in any and all media, whether now known or hereafter devised."
ArtistLounge,36o5dg,ArtFriend,4,Thu May 21 15:37:38 2015 UTC,"I noted that this pertains to all entries, not just the winner. And the section after your quote,   By submitting an Entry, Contestant acknowledges and agrees that Sponsor may obtain many submissions under this Contest and that such entries may be similar or identical in theme, idea, format or other respects to others submitted under this Contest and/or other contests staged and/or sponsored by the Sponsor, and waive any and all claims contestant may have had, may have, and/or may have in the future, that any composition, design, video and/or other works accepted, reviewed and/or used by the Sponsor (or its respective designees) may be similar to his/her Entry. Contestant acknowledges and agrees that the Sponsor does not have now, nor shall any of them have in the future, any duty or liability, direct or indirect, vicarious, contributory, or otherwise, with respect to the infringement or protection of any copyright in and to Contestant’s Entry.   makes it sound like they can, in the future, infringe on your submission without repercussion even if you don't win."

ArtistLounge,36o5dg,ArtFriend,1 point,Wed May 20 21:09:53 2015 UTC,"The restaurant outpost I've been to (not the main restaurant) has a very organic and modern feel to it (wood counters, etc.), and they are always posting pictures of their lunches and dinners on Instagram that showcase the naturally bright colors of their food, so I think illustration would probably be more what they're looking for, with of course, an interesting, artistic take.

ArtistLounge,36g0l0,AGamerDraws,2,Tue May 19 17:29:22 2015 UTC,"either release it as is, and chalk it up to past experience, or break it up into little parts and do a little every weekend. If you haven't got the where-with-all to finish it, and you can't even look at it anymore, maybe it's best just to let it go though. Are these edits even really necessary? Maybe they just seem that way. If this is about making it perfect before anyone sees it, unfortunately art can never be perfect. Not as long as you're growing past where you were, and changing your understanding."
ArtistLounge,36g0l0,oceana1009,2,Tue May 19 09:58:38 2015 UTC,"My trouble mostly comes from starting, not finishing, because I worry about messing it up or feel full of self-doubt. Sometimes it's necessary for me to push on despite a lack of motivation, whether that's from fear or a loss of interest. But if the push is stressful, the results are always bad.  What I do:    clean my workspace, since physical clutter makes my mind more distracted gather what I need to focus on just one picture or small piece get some music (soothing or energizing) that fits my current mood make tea!   The most important thing for me to successfully start and finish a piece is relaxing and removing distractions, which assists me in letting go of thinking about the future and allowing focus on just the one step I'm working on right in that moment. The better I do those things, the easier it is to fall into the art-making mindset."

ArtistLounge,36dar4,ArtFriend,9,Mon May 18 13:56:39 2015 UTC,Pro's is that more people get to see your work and i've had some people contact me for artwork (only one followed through though).  The con's though is that there are soooo many half assed selfies with low quality that get posted all the time and a lot of the time it feels like some people think this is /r/pics or somewhere to post their cool pics they want to show off instead of posting things that would work great as art work.
ArtistLounge,36dar4,ilovemrmiyagi,3,Mon May 18 20:52:37 2015 UTC,"yeah, and sometimes the most upvoted submissions are not necessarily the best art reference photos. But I guess people don't have that perspective to know what might work best."
ArtistLounge,36dar4,inbetweendoodles,1 point,Tue May 19 02:36:11 2015 UTC,I also feel like it has the potential to be a great learning tool or challenge to try and take a poor quality selfie and turn it into something better.

Personally when people post here I get to know them better. Then I recognize their usernames in RGD and that makes me feel like I'm part of a closer knit community. ;3;"
ArtistLounge,36dar4,Checkerszero,5,Tue May 19 04:22:48 2015 UTC,"I'm new to RGD/reddit, 6 months In. I don't post much. I like how well run RGD Is, don't have to worry about threads getting derailed, or other Internet shenanigans like most places(thanks mods). Very good user base and that It is about the ART/Artists. I don't know much about what the upvoting is for but I view/upvote any art In posts. Everyone Is at a different skill level, so just doing your best Is just fine, this Is meant to be fun after all. I only draw/paint what sparks my Interests, not concerned with upvoted submissions, so I suppose the more popular the sub Is good, never know what will be posted for us to draw."
ArtistLounge,36dar4,Checkerszero,3,Mon May 18 22:44:52 2015 UTC,"I say who really cares if requests are going unnoticed, despite gender/looks perhaps contributing to attention, I'd like to think the submissions that are creative and outstanding get drawn, and not spontaneous folk with a simple okay-quality selfie. That latter mentality feels a pinch entitled to me.  Effort shows on both sides."
ArtistLounge,36dar4,follymiser,7,Mon May 18 16:06:37 2015 UTC,"Gender/looks is an important point. Lately I've been questioning myself because the truth is, my portfolio is filled with beautiful, young white ladies (and the occasional smattering of an animal or a cute white baby). I REALLY want to draw a few people of different ethnicities, genders, etc. Different ages... also why have I never drawn anyone overweight???   So I have a lot of goals this summer."
ArtistLounge,36dar4,omgwtflols,5,Mon May 18 16:57:23 2015 UTC,Ian McKellen types! Lotsa wrinkles.  Ive had my hand at chubby figures drawing obscure fetish porn as a small hobby. Tmi? Tmi.

ArtistLounge,36dar4,omgwtflols,3,Mon May 18 20:42:32 2015 UTC,Stop being biased then to pretty thin white chicks and draw some normal folks who post on RGD (maybe the unnoticed requests.) :3

ArtistLounge,36dar4,ItWillBeMine,7,Thu May 21 15:38:51 2015 UTC,"When I have the time, and get around to drawing in RGD (which I have in the past), I always look for the quiet unnoticed posts. Usually they are the newest (not the hotest) posts. Sometimes, I never get feedback or a thanks from OP or other users, but that's perfectly OK with me. I am aware that there are some powerhouse artists that continuously get upvoted and all the monthly vote awards (they are also a lot better at photo realistic digital painting than I am right now), and those folks almost always post on the most popular posts. Since I don't want to ""compete"" with them, I stick to the unnoticed posts. I think as long as the OP gets drawn, I'm happy."
ArtistLounge,36dar4,drbjr,9,Mon May 18 23:01:43 2015 UTC,"Ooo, can I play this game from a mod perspective?  Pros: More and more artists are joining, which means I get to watch more and more people develop and improve as artists. There are some people who are like completely different artists compared to when they first started. My dear friend sgt_mary_mary comes to mind as one of those people. From a bleachers perspective, more artists means more cool styles upon which to feast my eyes. So that's fun.   Cons: It's become nothing short of excruciating to pick only five choices per week. I changed my mind three times before posting the ones I selected from this week. And even then, I still wasn't totally satisfied because too many amazing pieces were left out. Another con is the feeling of insecurity that drawinglearner mentions. It does seem like the bar is set pretty high, and I wonder if that makes beginners less likely to participate. I sometimes draw for a submission and won't post it, because I'm not very good at all and I already get dissed enough as it is. ;)   From a sub perspective, the growth is great.  From a community perspective, I've found the growth to be detrimental. We used to actively advertise for the sub to get it to grow. Now it just grows of its own accord, like some kind of beautiful, wild, free art monster. :D"
ArtistLounge,36dar4,ItWillBeMine,3,Mon May 18 20:28:23 2015 UTC,"I wish you would keep posting art. I am just so certain that as a community, everyone appreciates each others' art. I NEVER look at someone's art (except for troll art) and think ""this is better or worse than the next portrait"". I just don't compare pieces to each other.   I LOVE that RGD is for all skill levels. I would be way too embarrassed to post otherwise - I'm super critical of my own work, and I've been scared away from many corners of the internet because I get easily humiliated by constructive crits from strangers, even the most well-intentioned one. RGD feels like home, and part of what makes it seem that way to me is because everybody is so comfortable. So I wish you felt comfortable sharing too! It would make me and so many other people very happy. <3"

ArtistLounge,36dar4,sgt_mary_mary,6,Tue May 19 02:50:02 2015 UTC,"Since you're a mod, I just want to say that I get turned off from RGD sometimes because you all keep giving the monthly awards to the same photorealistic digital painting artists over and over again. No matter what, its like the same 5 people or so. Then again, when I have posted in the past (I'm wrapping up classes so haven't had time to post in a while), I don't do it for the awards or recognition, I do it for fun. But still, even when I've made a bunch of posts in one month of art, I never get recognized, which is fine. The OPs like it. But I think there's some favortism going on, or the mods never made it fully clear on how monthly favorites are chosen."
ArtistLounge,36dar4,omgwtflols,5,Mon May 18 23:05:21 2015 UTC,"Hi.   you all keep giving the monthly awards to the same photorealistic digital painting artists over and over again.   No we don't. I don't, anyway. My choices tend to be roughly half traditional, half digital. Also, what if some mods just prefer digital photorealism? <shrug> Why is that bad if that is their own preference? That's why it's good that there are six of us. We all have different styles. I tend to prefer traditional over digital just slightly. And I tend to prefer freehand over paintovers slightly. But I think all styles in RGD are valuable. To each their own. Also, there are waaaay more than five people chosen over and over, considering that 30 awards are given out every week. And lastly, look at our latest Artist of the Month - Smiley_Dafe. A traditional artist. I'm sorry to say that I think all of this disproves your point.  I've noticed more complaining about the mod choices recently, accompanied with this new kind of sense of entitlement or something. It kind of sucks because it's insulting to the people who get picked by insinuating that they don't deserve to be selected. And we are pretty protective of insults against the artists.    I think there's some favoritism going on, or the mods never made it fully clear on how monthly favorites are chosen.   That's kind icky, considering that I know just from talking with the mods every week how agonizing it is for all of us to choose. Want to know the favorites are chosen? We go with the pieces of art we like the best, and that's it.  Regarding the favoritism comment:  I think every mod has their own favorites. I will choose Drokart just as often as possible. Mary_mary really likes Inspector_Santini's work and chooses her frequently. Heyryaaan tends to select oohcabbage. When yo was a mod, he liked to pick wombatling and bootstrapbuckaroo. It's natural to have artists that really resonate with you.   Lastly, this comment toes the line of the rule ""Do not complain about the modding at RGD."" I get where you're coming from, but my advice is not to participate in RGD for the awards. There are so many pieces of art per week that the odds of getting selected are like two percent or less.  Here are my five choices from this week - hardly an emphasis on digital photorealism - two digital pieces, three traditional:  http://i.imgur.com/MpxDoek.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/zCCHBIH.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/551spEA.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/mqRpFd5.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/Aa6KFyt.jpg"
ArtistLounge,36dar4,follymiser,2,Mon May 18 23:21:28 2015 UTC,"I wasn't going to comment much but I have to say you mods do a great job at being diverse. I enjoy seeing all the different kinds of awesome art here. Also can I ask since the whole flair things has been coming up a bit In these posts, what the flair is for? outside of recognition of being picked for a pick of the week(which Is good enough). Like does It do anything else?. I'm not really sure why some are making It a big deal, not to sound rude/ungrateful or anything. Also I turned mine off cause I didn't want others to see It, but had to turn It back on for the RGD artist directory said I had to have one. Some saying that they shy away from post with artists with flairs, or lots of up-votes, wouldn't want people to not view the art based on something like that.  I'm just trying to make sense of this place."
ArtistLounge,36dar4,the-tinidril,2,Thu May 21 13:46:15 2015 UTC,Personally for me the flair is like motivation. I was so psyched when I got my first flair and I'm always working for more. It's like a pat-on-the-back form of payment. Like collecting 'em all in a pokemon game.

ArtistLounge,36dar4,drawinglearner,5,Thu May 21 15:32:50 2015 UTC,"I actually was just thinking the other day that you guys do an amazing job of choosing a variety of mediums. Sometimes I feel sad when I'm overlooked because I'm a sensitive artist and I try really hard, BUT as soon as I see the art by the winners I always understand. Even if you guys have your favorites, you do a fabulous job recognizing people fairly and covering a wide range of skill levels, mediums, and creative approaches.  I wish people wouldn't give you a hard time about who you choose. The weekly awards are only a positive thing to me. I'm over the moon when chosen, yet motivated to improve when I'm not. Plus, since I'm not online all the time, I get to see a selection of art I might not have seen otherwise.   So thank you for keeping up with it! It seems like a time consuming process and I'm appreciative that you do all this work... unpaid, too. It's great of you and the other mods.  Edit: also, favoritism isn't the right word. You don't choose people because you like them better, you just have preferences for certain types of art which is totally understandable. So do I. So does everyone. Art is subjective."
ArtistLounge,36dar4,OneiricOstrich,2,Tue May 19 02:26:07 2015 UTC,"Thank you! And for what it's worth...you're never overlooked, not really. I love the bejeezus out of your work.

ArtistLounge,36dar4,Chokeberry,2,Tue May 19 03:04:13 2015 UTC,"This is so untrue... Do you look at the art by the winners? Some extremely talented people get chosen multiple times. In my experience, those are usually the digital artists with creative approaches rather than the photorealistic ones. I've seen that the mods have a tendency to reward creativity - sometimes even picking pieces that are creative over other works that are more technically ""correct"". Because of that they choose an incredible variety of mediums, styles, and artists. It's a lot of work and shouldn't be criticized. They do the best job they can."
ArtistLounge,36dar4,ItWillBeMine,4,Tue May 19 02:29:16 2015 UTC,"You are very right!  Since I update flair after every mod favourite post,  I have a pretty good grasp of where these awards go, and each and every week some of the picks are from artists who have never received flair before, as well as from artists who've only been picked once or twice. I'd say a fairly large portion of the active artists have been featured at some point. It's not just the same photo realistic digital artists over and over again."
ArtistLounge,36dar4,follymiser,1 point,Tue May 19 06:51:48 2015 UTC,"You're right, the mods do a fantastic job. I apologize for coming off as jaded.

You know, you could always post your art under an alt :)  I honestly have no idea how you guys do it now that the sub is so huge (re: picking only 5).  It must've been tough back in the day, and now the volume of submissions must be huge."
ArtistLounge,36dar4,bellevuefineart,3,Mon May 18 20:56:54 2015 UTC,"I haven't been a part of the sub very long, so I really don't have any comparisons. But I will say that it can feel intimidating, even for an experienced artist like myself, to post my ordinary-realistic-portraiture when there are so many who can turn an ordinary photo into a bit of magic :D I have been known to get creative with a source photo, I'm just saying that my first inclination is kind of pedestrian, lol! It comes from a lot of experience doing commissioned portraits where the client expects to receive a precise likeness, not an ""interpretation"". So, for me, RGD has been very freeing, I've been able to step beyond the ""expected"" and do something different.   The best part is that we all have this willing pool of volunteer models! It's like having a studio session ready every morning and I get to pick the models I want. Heaven must be like that :D  I do tend to pick photos that are clear, well-lit, high-rez, and mostly not-selfies. And I avoid glasses if I can help it... glasses give me fits LOL!  I started with no (recent) portfolio of portraits before I started doing requests here, and now I have a 48-sheet portfolio filled with 38 samples of my work in a variety of styles and media (just in traditional media, more if you count the digital). All I have to say to this sub, it's submitters, artists and mods, is a huge THANK YOU! :D"

I contacted him to see if he might have known whether this painting was drawn from a real life piece of artwork... no luck, just that there are lots of renderings of this type of image in the northeast.    I am sure that growing up, we had this exact same painting on the wall, down to the perspective, content and placement. Curious if anyone out there might recognize it."

ArtistLounge,36bfp7,is_relevant,2,Mon May 18 03:56:08 2015 UTC,"I agree. The style rocks and overall the painting works. If you are going for realism, ear proportions and placement are similar to the nose. She needs more of a chin and upper lip. The space between eyes should be about the length of one eye.   But for a stylized illustration, you can play with proportions for a dramatic effect."

I'm curious if you use Photoshop and whether the dark teal shadow you have in this piece is on a separate layer?  If it is, I'd like to see if you could set it to a multiply layer and soften it a bit.  I think that it would read better as a shadow - there's nothing wrong with the way it is right now, I think you captured the OP beautifully.  I'm just worried that without the original reference someone might not understand  the significance of the foreground shadow."
ArtistLounge,3665ci,Sweetstreetmeat,2,Sat May 16 23:33:04 2015 UTC,"I use photoshop and the shadow across the face is on a seperate layer! Thank you so much, by the way, for the compliment and cc! I wasn't sure if the shadow would be too extreme. I was thinking about making it a completely straight filled line, so there would be no transparency, because I was worried about the way the shadow would read especially in a teal. That you think I should lighten it some more and play with the transparency I think means it was smart not to do that lol. I'll deffinetly lighten it when I get home and try to see if that helps it read better! Thank you again!   Edit: also sorry if this doesn't make much sense, I'm out right now and it's hard to concentrate on writing and listening woops."
ArtistLounge,3665ci,funisher,3,Sun May 17 00:03:36 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love how smooth your brushwork is! There is a lot of subtley in those blends. And the fine lines of the hair look great.  I did have some thoughts regarding the shadow. In the case of this piece I agree with /u/blacklant that it might make the piece stronger to just remove it. This isn't because the image itself is better without a shadow, it's just that in this instance the shadow feels more like an after thought and I think it might be taking away more than it's adding.  One way to look at shadows when painting is to really think of them as the structure of the object, not just a division of light. In real life we tend to associate shadows separately from the object. They aren't a part of the surface or texture, so we naturally want to draw our lines around the tactile form. But remember, we're transitioning everything to an illusion of form. In this universe a shadow (or a color) holds the same weight and presence as the physical and tactile object. To really get those intense shadows to pop dramatically they need to be drawn into the form right from the beginning. The shadows actually determine the form itself. This always messed with my head and one way that I helped practice these ideas was to sketch the figure only using the shapes of the shadows, flatten all of the information, and contour the background with the foreground. One good way to see this kind of composition is to throw the source photo into something like photoshop and switch it to a two tone black and white. The unfortunate thing about this source photo is the angle of the shadows fall awkwardly on her face. It's one of those weird instances where if the OP didn't mention the circumstances the shadows would actually look confusing in the photo too. Particularly since they don't really highlight the form very well. Regardless, here is a cutout version to highlight how the shadows are actually disclosing the form, which is always a good spring board for a painting."

I wound up just removing the shadow across the op's face and the hand shadow completely and it looks much better now.

ArtistLounge,3623lp,abraxart,1 point,Fri May 15 15:37:00 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I inked with a  sketch fountain pen, using Noodler's Heart of Darkness ink."
ArtistLounge,3623lp,adillac,2,Fri May 15 16:25:07 2015 UTC,I thought it was a fountain pen!   I love HoD! I'm using that in my Pilot Vanishing Point now. Try Ancient Copper by Diamine. Thats a great color for sketches.   What pen did you use?
ArtistLounge,3623lp,Devil_Nights,1 point,Fri May 15 16:31:58 2015 UTC,I used the pen that came with the ink. Never heard of Ancient Copper  before but it fits the bill for what I've been needing to add in to my inks. Thanks very much for the info.
ArtistLounge,361x3t,Onomaya,4,Fri May 15 12:19:12 2015 UTC,"Damn sorry to hear. I think depending on where the paw prints are, if a digital scan and reprint might work. Use photoshop to clear up what you can using clone tool and maybe print a quality scan. Then work back on that with ink to complete the piece."
ArtistLounge,361x3t,Oldninja,1 point,Fri May 15 13:19:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for the reply. your suggestion could work. Especially since a pro will do the scan and vectorizing. They can probably work it out. Still embarrassing, though. Thank you!"

Oh well, I won't be able to finish it until tomorrow - by which time the post will probably have received several responses anyway."
ArtistLounge,35xnd3,carterartist,2,Fri May 15 03:29:58 2015 UTC,"Gorgeous! And I've been wondering several times.... I often see the digi-artists do mirrored pictures. Is there a technical reason for that, ""process-wise""? Or is it just.... because because?"
ArtistLounge,35xnd3,CommanderRocket,2,Fri May 15 04:44:24 2015 UTC,"Yes that piece by freeflow is indeed gorgeous, as is most of the stuff s/he posts.  I usually flip the piece that I'm drawing/painting upside down once in a while just to get a look from a different perspective, it helps to spot places that need correcting.  But I've never done a mirrored image like freeflow did and wouldn't know the reason for doing so."
ArtistLounge,35xnd3,metabaron,3,Fri May 15 06:41:28 2015 UTC,I've tried the upside down thing - it just prompts the vertebrae in my neck to embark on a slow and painful tango. Usually anticlockwise. ;) And I should have specified: my happy exclamation of gorgeousness was about your colour choice for the OP's hair as much as for  Freeflow's (equally gorgeous) artwork. ;) And then my two brain cells got confuddled - it's not often they get bombarded with both mirror images and purple hair simultaneously. ;D

ArtistLounge,35xkdv,Sahnura,3,Thu May 14 10:30:46 2015 UTC,"I think this is quite difficult. Maybe you could make a list of adjectives that, in your mind, fit her and post them here. Maybe we can make something of that. Maybe you will find things, animals or form and colors that fit these adjectives.  Secondly, in this case I'd always take the approach that seems to be the most fun to you. The result will be much better if you had fun doing it, instead of setting for something that you think would get better results but is not your cup of tea."
ArtistLounge,35xkdv,headcrab1991,2,Thu May 14 11:46:08 2015 UTC,"I'd rather not post the adjectives, just because I want the specific details that come to mind to be mine, but thanks for the advice. I'll definitely think about that. :)  I can think of things that I could use to describe her, but it's the putting it all together that I'm stuck on the most. I don't want it to be a scattered mess, you know? I don't know, I guess I'll have to do some more thinking."
ArtistLounge,35xkdv,headcrab1991,2,Thu May 14 12:23:13 2015 UTC,"I get that. Has to be personal. If you don't want a collage or overly complicated peace, simplicity is the way to go. Maybe your piece can focus on one or just a few aspects... Maybe it's just a single object, painted in a specific way.  Some other ideas:  Maybe you can express something trough how far you take the piece. Is it higly polished or just barely finished?  Can you see how it is made or does it obstruct it's inner workings?  Also format, is it a conventional size and/or ratio or does it step out of the usual?  Or regarding how you approach it, maybe it is fitting for this piece to not have a full plan but rather just jump in there and see where it takes you, if that fits the personality of the portraiee (if that's a word).  There are a lot of questions to be answered but actually that is a very good exercise in learning how to ask yourself questions and choosing the answers that benefit the piece the most. Something I just started to learn."
ArtistLounge,35xkdv,headcrab1991,2,Thu May 14 12:35:54 2015 UTC,"Okay one, I just want to let you know how awesome it is that you're taking the time to help me out. Thanks so much.

ArtistLounge,35slfh,somnivision,1 point,Wed May 13 08:24:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks, it's looking like hand cranking is the way to go."
ArtistLounge,35slfh,dead_painter,1 point,Wed May 13 11:55:37 2015 UTC,Back in school they had these wall mounted sharpeners with a crank handle and 2 rotating blades like a wood chipper. They ate up quite a bit of the pencil but gave the same long lead like you described. Not something you could buy off the shelf though...  A pocket knife or xacto blade can give you the longest lead with the least waste. It doesn't take very long once you get the handle of it but it works regardless of the lead thickness that varies from different manufacturers.
ArtistLounge,35slfh,glitterzomb,1 point,Wed May 13 05:54:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, those silver ones that ate your pencil up are the ones I liked but occasionally they would sharpen one side well and leave the other covered in wood so you kinda had to peel the rest of. Thanks I'll look into the xacto."
ArtistLounge,35slfh,toverbai,1 point,Wed May 13 11:57:23 2015 UTC,"I bought one of these a few months ago, and it is fantastic. Metal body, easy cleaning, and it puts one hell of a sharp tip on my pencils. I use Col-erase pencils quite a bit, and with this sharpener, the tips are almost too sharp. Col-erase lead is soft, and the newly sharpened tip will break off if I'm not careful.   I've gone through a number of electric sharpeners and this easily tops them all. Probably the last one I will ever buy."

ArtistLounge,358w7c,FoxtrotOscar23,6,Fri May 8 02:09:54 2015 UTC,"Ok, it's late, but I want to throw out some tips. I have to make it a little brief because I should really be asleep but we're talkin' about oil painting here so sleep has to wait.  First off, yep, shitty brushes don't stand a chance against mineral spirits. Natural hair brushes are the most resistant, but they can be a little rough. You have to determine what feels best for you. I find for rendering I still prefer a softer longer bristle. This is also because I like painting on would and short bristles can tend to push the paint right off the board.  Yes, you need gesso. And it's worth investing in good gesso. Cheap gesso rots, and a painting is only as strong as its first layer. Fortunately, you don't need a lot of brushes to get going. You can get by with these supplies.. (not including the paint). It might be nice to also have a filbert brush for blending too...  Anyways, here's what we got in the picture:  --2 flat edge brushes. one big, one small. These are a 1"" and a 1/2"". These brushes are great for laying in the plains. I don't know much about digital art but from watching peoples videos there is still a heavy drawing element to it. I think you can work in a more painterly way with digital, but with oil, you're working with plains more than lines. That's where these square edge brushes excel.  --2 round brushes: These can be used to draw those few lines, but mostly for the details bulbous edges.  --2 containers for mineral spirits (I use turpenoid, and though it's odorless that doesn't mean it's fumeless. Be sure to have ventilation or an open window): One can for clean turp, and one for dirty (you will need a third to transfer the turps back and forth when the gunk settles to the bottom and you transfer the dirty back to the clean. I can explain that process in more detail if you need). Anyways, clean the brush in the dirty first, then the clean. The fastest way to gross, muddy colors is dirty turp.  Brush cleaner: I used to think soap was good enough but I noticed that my bristles kept poofing out and fraying. When I started using brush conditioner my brushes lasted a lot longer and held their nice edges. Clean with the conditioner then leave it on the brush when done to preserve the bristle shape. And invest a little in your brushes, you're only buying for or five so don't buy those cheap packs.  Palette knife: Yeah, butter knife won't be able to mix the paint properly. Use a palette knife. I mix my paint on sheets of glass but you can use something like a plastic plate if need be.  Liquin: Linseed oil is the standard, but liquin is nice because it can dry within 24 hours so you don't have to worry about accidentally blending layers and muddying your palette.  Here's the thing. I mentioned layers. Oil painting works great in layers. Acrylic is similar, but you really gotta be patient with oils. You can do a painting in one sitting but that's not where it really shines. Work in layers, from distant to close, and dark to light. After you get a good foundation you can start playing with these rules. You can throw a dark glaze on a light layer, then paint light on that to add more depth etc.  But regardless, here is an oil portrait I did a while back. I took a photo after each night of painting to demonstrate a layered approach to oil painting.  Anyways, there is more to say but I'm tired and need to sleep. We can chat more about it tomorrow. :)"
ArtistLounge,358w7c,funisher,2,Fri May 8 07:41:39 2015 UTC,"Wow, that was comprehensive, thank you very much for taking the time.  Yeah, I'm getting that I've been trying to do this half assed, and it shows in the results. Don't know if I'm patient enough for oils, I've never done anything that I haven't finished in one sitting, but I'm determined to give it a go. I'll try to get to the art store this weekend I think.  May take a couple of evening classes too, for the basics at least, I mean, I thought gesso was pronounced with a hard 'G' until I heard you talking about it in the podcast:)"
ArtistLounge,358w7c,funisher,2,Sat May 9 01:23:59 2015 UTC,"Yep, oils take a while. That painting I posted in the last comment took about 60 hours. But it doesn't always have to be like that. This painting only took one sitting for 5-6 hours. Oil can be a little tricky for painting in one sitting because its easy to muddy up the colors, but just remember to paint fat over thin and that should help. (Also makes the painting more archival)"
ArtistLounge,358w7c,funisher,2,Sat May 9 01:48:18 2015 UTC,"that's awesome, that's the kind of looseness I want to emulate, and I was being driven mad by the canvas paper just soaking up every brushstroke when I tried"
ArtistLounge,358w7c,funisher,2,Sat May 9 02:58:44 2015 UTC,Canvas paper is a bummer. You should gesso some wood panels. Have them chop some nice thick panels at Home Depot. You can get quite a few out of one sheet. Lauan is nice but you need to be sure to get thick boards or else you have to cradle them. You can also learn on some canvas panels or pre-stretched canvas too. Wood is just nice for getting those long brushstrokes.
ArtistLounge,358w7c,cotyart,2,Sat May 9 03:52:57 2015 UTC,thanks for all this. I'm sure I'll have more ridiculous questions once my order from Dick Blick arrives:D

ArtistLounge,358w7c,graymankin,1 point,Wed May 13 14:03:44 2015 UTC,"I hope you don't mind me asking on this, because this is four days old now, but this is the third oil painting I've done and I did it using the cheap oil paints (a small set for like 5 bucks at Michael) and some cheap brushes (the kind that come in a pack for kids). No gesso, no oil or anything like that.  I was pretty happy with it, and it's stood the test of time well, but now I'm wondering if the quality of the piece would be greatly improved if I switched to the better materials?"
ArtistLounge,358w7c,gemellion93,1 point,Wed May 13 04:25:51 2015 UTC,"First, I don't mind at all! It's what I'm here for!  Second, for the love of god upgrade your materials!! You are so ready! That's your third oil painting!? :O You will be amazed the difference quality brushes will make. You should definitely gesso your surface so it doesn't deteriorate. You should get 6 or so nice brushes (couple flat edge, couple rounds, a filbert or two). You should pick up some brush cleaner/conditioner so those brushes stay in good shape. And pick up a full palette.  I would say if you want to upgrade slowly, upgrade the brushes first. And gesso your surface (sand it smooth between each layer of gesso). That's where you're gonna see the first immediate improvements, especially with the edges you'll get with the flat edge bruses. And I don't know if you are mixing any liquin or linseed oil with your paint too, but you should do that as well. Just mix a little with each color you blend. Make that paint buttery smooth.  Oh man, and keep me posted!! Cuz it's gonna look sweeeeeet! :D"
ArtistLounge,358w7c,blazing_ent,2,Wed May 13 05:37:39 2015 UTC,"Hi all, I've been attempting playing with oil paint for the first time ever, and it's frustrating. I certainly wasn't expecting to be amazing straight away, but I thought I'd be able to produce something....better. Hey, I'm learning lots though. Pics in the album are in order from first to latest.  Things I have learned so far;   -canvas paper just slurps up anything other than slapping it on thick, should I be gesso-ing it?   Brushes from a $5 24 pack behave the way you'd expect them to   -Getting and keeping a likeness doing wet on wet is hard. Like, really hard   A butter knife is not a decent palette knife substitute   Anyway, thought I'd put them here and see if anyone had any advice or CC. Am I making lots of noob errors that should be glaringly obvious, that I'm blind to, because I have no idea what I'm doing?  Thanks in advance:)"
ArtistLounge,3599ah,graymankin,6,Fri May 8 04:16:18 2015 UTC,"I know that feeling. I went to college for creative advertising and I got my diploma, but I got a much bigger lesson in the soul-sucking feeling of taking something I love and turning it into ""work."" Leaving high school, I would easily fill a sketchbook a month with fantastical doodles and characters and scenes and, though my technique was rough, it was pure joy in those pages. By the time I finished college, my skills had improved dramatically but I realized I hadn't actually drawn anything for myself in nearly two years. I found an older sketchbook that I had left half blank and just sat there staring at the page... nothing came out. I ended up sketching a half-hearted figure drawing. It was clean and precise, and it was absolutely lifeless. And I decided right there that I couldn't do the agency life. No ad, no campaign, had ever brought me the joy that I got from those sketchbooks. So I got an IT job, a steady paycheck, and I started drawing for myself again. Little silly things that meant nothing and were for nothing and I loved them. And I showed them to friends and they liked them too and so they'd ask me to draw silly things for them and I would and I loved those, too. And then occasionally people would ask me what they owe and I said ""oh I dunno, just whatever you think is fair."" Sometimes that was lunch or a ten-spot; other times it was free stuff and occasionally it was serious money. But that didn't matter, because I was only drawing things I wanted to draw. Things that made me smile or made friends smile and I would have done them all if they hadn't offered me a dime. Every now and then, in exchange for free rein to draw at work, my boss will have me whip something up for the office. A silly sign here, a goofy t-shirt print there. And he says the same thing each time: ""You know, it's a shame you're wasting your talent working here.""  But I'm not. Wasting it would have been 40 hours a week drawing ads for toilet tissue and credit cards, and never having taken the time to draw the occasional bankrobbing bear in a fez."
ArtistLounge,3599ah,keenedge422,2,Fri May 8 06:40:46 2015 UTC,"That's similar to what happened to me with school. I got a lot technically better, but I was hardly making anything of my own and I suddenly became hypercritical of my ideas to the point that everything seemed stupid and not worth making. I used to make art that came out of raw emotions, and now I'm afraid to touch the subject. I never got to work full time doing anything like that, but I feel the same would happen and that's why I prefer freelance. I can pick the projects, and even though they're not my thing, I enjoy the challenge of making everything aesthetically pleasing. Problem with that is a lack of work.  I know how hating what you loved feels too.. I used to knit professionally for a company for about 2 years. I went from knitting all the time for fun to doing it once a year, and hating it thanks to this job. Too many stupid, ugly patterns and knitting like 50 of the same thing.. It was sweatshop work.   I'm worried if I do what you did, I'll find the job mind numbing and lose interest in art all together. I had a regular full time job doing retail once, and I just felt so drained of emotional energy, I couldn't pick up the pencil and sketch anything. I made no art during that period.   Your art makes me feel like you'd have a good time getting into comics. :)"
ArtistLounge,3599ah,keenedge422,1 point,Fri May 8 15:25:54 2015 UTC,"I'm worried if I do what you did, I'll find the job mind numbing   Oh you probably will. I've been doing this job for, oh god, 13 years now; it can get tedious as fuck. But I'm lucky enough to have a job with a lot of downtime and a boss who doesn't care how I fill that time as long as the work gets done, so I get to use art as my escape from monotony. If a day is dragging by, and most of them do, I fire up Adobe CC and draw something ridiculous and everything seems better.  Retail is a special hell, though. Avoid that at all costs. I'll live in a van down by the river before I ever do that."
ArtistLounge,3599ah,FlexOne,1 point,Fri May 8 18:45:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, just having a job these days is pretty special. I can't figure what kind of job I'd be OK with doing. I'm trying to do video work, which I actually really enjoy, but that takes a while to build a reputation and really get going. For a day job, I don't know. I haven't been able to pass more than 6 months without wanting to die at a day job, so dealing with shitty projects or clients seems way less draining."

If you try to skimp on the bad work, you might get something done, but if you give yourself the freedom to screw up you'll get more and better.

ArtistLounge,3599ah,inbetweendoodles,2,Fri May 8 15:45:50 2015 UTC,"Yes and no, I am more likely to produce good quality art when ""under stress"" just because it takes my mind off things. I don't use art as a job and am currently a student so money is tight and I commission when the opportunity presents itself but not always."
ArtistLounge,3599ah,inbetweendoodles,1 point,Fri May 8 22:26:22 2015 UTC,"I actually switched to digital art because oh how expensive traditional painting is even though I love it. I totally understand, I am graduating soon and commissions could really help while finding a job. But the first problem, with commissions I don't always get to choose the photo to work from and if I don't enjoy it I just do not do a good job. I try but me enjoying it is a huge part of the problem. And I also severely undercharge my work. I only charge $50 for a portrait which is a problem because I haven't been able to raise it for two reasons. One, half of people who come to me heard about me from someone who already commissioned me. This means they expect that price and it gets tiring arguing with people that the reason I need to raise the price is that I have improved and it takes me more time to finish a piece.  Two, people who don't know me rarely understand why art is expensive? I have had potential clients fight me  about my prices because ""I do it all the time so why do I charge so much?"" $50 isnt even much! I am making less than minimum wage doing that! FFfff people. I just had a really bad commission where the client wanted to keep all the rights to my art and fought me constantly about the price. Nooo. nooo. No.I cancelled that one. On the bright side, because I am digital, I have the materials with me at all times so I don't feel like money stands in the way of my ability to make art.  I hope I didn't tangent off too much. And also used that word correctly. I hope you get to a point where you can create art that makes you feel proud and happy without money standing in your way! And I hope we both get good jobs!"
ArtistLounge,3599ah,inbetweendoodles,1 point,Fri May 8 13:21:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I tried digital art more than once but it's just really not the same thing for me. I think it's because I've been doing traditional art for so long and have my own techniques - it just never comes out in a way I'm happy with it and I really don't enjoy it. I've limited myself to only watercolour because of material and studio cost. I'm totally with you there... $50 buys like.. Barely 2 hours of my time depending on the materials and then that's probably without shipping. With that, I can do an elaborate sketch, but people usually want something I would spend 8-14 hrs on. Getting clients these days is mega hard. I haven't done a commission in a long while because of how reluctant people are to spend. I also find they don't understand the process, so it scares them to trust someone with something they aren't comfortable with themselves. I'm doing work for myself, but I got no means to pay the bills and that's eating me from the inside out."
ArtistLounge,3599ah,inbetweendoodles,1 point,Fri May 8 14:25:06 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, I completely agree, I think people get scared away from buying custom art because they don't understand what goes into it and also that they shy away from trusting a stranger to do their job. I want and need to start charging $100+ for my time spent to be worth it but it's so hard to find people willing to spend that. I mean at this rate I'd rather just not do commissions and I WILL turn people down if they seem like they are going to be difficult. Yikes. That sounds really hard, I'm sorry. I wish I could help. Do you have some like portfolio/contact site? I can share it on some of my sites to see if anyone is looking for a watercolor commission atm?"
ArtistLounge,3599ah,blazing_ent,1 point,Fri May 8 14:29:17 2015 UTC,"Where are you looking for work? If it's deviantart, then I've never seen anyone make 100 on there. The problem is really that people don't want to pay, but artists also keep bringing their prices down,so the people who don't want to pay can always find someone cheaper to do it. Artists don't realize, by doing this, they're handing over control of their careers entirely to clients. It's smarter to come up with inexpensive products or projects  Ie: my normal watercolours run anywhere from 80-400$, but I have a project where I'll do a quick sketch for $10 on a smaller paper. I also have postcard prints I'm going to start doing more of - I can sell them for less than 5$,but selling prints is tricky if it's not in person. It's hard, but you really have to stand your ground and just work on your own stuff if people are gonna be cheap. It's disrespectful to you.   My website is artkarolina.com, any watercolours will be under traditional art or life drawing. Another good place to look is my instagram since I post WIP on there: @art.karolina Even if you just want to share it just because, I appreciate it. I find people are more likely to share cat gifs than art, even if they like it, so I appreciate shares."

The high contrast from your darks, mid tones, and highlights can make your painting much more visually striking, and add much more depth.   Keep going!"
ArtistLounge,3504lk,Gaderael,2,Wed May 6 02:00:30 2015 UTC,"Thank you. That seems very accurate... they look flat to me, too. Exaggerating both the highlights and shadows is probably the key, since I'm trying to be faithful to the original picture. I really appreciate your taking the time to respond. :)"
ArtistLounge,3504lk,somnivision,3,Wed May 6 03:31:34 2015 UTC,"I think you have a good start here but as already noted, try to exaggerate your values more if you want to create some depth. Use a larger brush in areas like hair to keep it loose and wispy. Introduce some softness by lightly going over some of your edges with a dry filbert to create areas of focus. Use more grey and desaturated shades to also create depth and harmonize the color palette.   If you have to use paper for your support, gesso it directly to hardboard first. (Just paint over the edges and it will stay in place, remove with a palette knife) This will remove the warping and allow you to use more paint as I can see parts of the canvas peeking through. Also, acrylics on raw paper will dry ridiculously fast - more brush dragging, much harder to blend & glaze when trying to paint skin.  Hope this helps!"
ArtistLounge,3504lk,westopher718,2,Wed May 6 07:07:49 2015 UTC,"Thank you! That is a lot of great information; the paper warping has been an issue unless I use thick watercolor paper. I'll try using gesso. I also need to look into color theory more, and your advice on grey and desaturated shades is a good place for me to start.  Thanks so much!"
ArtistLounge,3504lk,nyxinus,2,Wed May 6 07:21:41 2015 UTC,"Acrylic is not an easy medium! You've been doing great so far. I really like the second one, I enjoy the colors there.  I'm not an expert in acrylic at all, BUT one technique that really helped me further my skill was figuring out how to do washes. But I suppose it depends on your style. I like a using a little more muted colors, whereas yours are quite vibrant. But washes can be helpful in blending those colors... like adding depth and shadow gradually instead of BAM TOO DARK OH CRAP OH CRAP OH CRAP.  Keep it up!"
ArtistLounge,3504lk,nyxinus,1 point,Wed May 6 04:55:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not really sure what my style is... I like so many different types of art, I just keep messing around. I really passionately adore u/onomaya, and if I could magically paint like her, I would in a heartbeat. I will mess around with washes and see if that feels more natural; my self-portrait (the one with the blue wig) was the first one, and I didn't even know that acrylics could be used with water, which made any attempt at blending terribly difficult. The second one on here is my most recent (I should have posted them in order), and I worked much more quickly and tried not to let my self obsess over tiny details. Thank you so much for taking the time to respond! I really appreciate it. :)"
ArtistLounge,3504lk,longlivetupac,2,Wed May 6 06:40:53 2015 UTC,"Wonderful to see you dive into acrylics! They are really hard to master since they dry so fast.  It looks like you're getting more comfortable with blending in the later ones. Do you use a retarding medium to keep them from drying as fast? If not, that will make it a lot easier.  The main thing that stands out to me is the drawings are not quite right, and painting always makes inaccuracies stand out even more. Do you draw first, or jump straight into painting?  The second one is definitely my favorite: great use of color and texture, and the drawing feels really accurate."

ArtistLounge,351edr,the-tinidril,1 point,Thu May 7 07:18:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not a copyright lawyer. But it seems to me that here on RGD we use a basic ""model release"" agreement that seems to work. The photos that people submit belong to them at all times. They agree to allow artists to use these photos to create art. The artist retains the right to use their art, to produce copies and to sell. The submitter has the right to print the art to keep or give away, but not to sell.  On deviantArt, some users produce ""stock"" photos or other art resources, and release artists to use them under certain situations and with some restrictions or stipulations. Artists are usually free to interpret the stock, or to use it in photo manipulations, if they also give credit to the original stock artist. This usually includes any release to use the art outside dA or for commercial purposes.   If you devise an agreement that allows the people to retain ownership of their own photos (only reasonable since you are asking them to provide a service to you by taking the photo themselves), then you will likely not have so many who refuse. They may wish to have credit given if you publish the art (even just on a website) especially if they also have a website that features their photography. Be willing to negotiate individual agreements.  I know that stock artists use their blog/profile etc. to stipulate publicly their release terms. I don't know how well an email agreement would stand up to copyright law... for that you'd need to seek out a lawyer ;)"
ArtistLounge,351edr,somnivision,1 point,Thu May 7 06:48:46 2015 UTC,"This article here covers the basics in US law but each country is different and some don't even copyright laws.  A useful excerpt:    Artist's have always, will always, draw and paint whatever they want: it is naive for anyone, layman or lawyer, to believe otherwise. To try to prevent it by wagging a finger and reciting ""no, no, no""…well, good luck with that. There is no Copyright Cop standing over their shoulder, snatching the pencil out of their hand the minute they draw Vampirella or copy a Kirby drawing. There's no way to legislate against an artist's freedom of expression, even if those expressions ultimately turn out to be some form of an infringement. In other words, there really isn't an absolute answer. At least not one that people still won't argue about.    Since you are distorting their likeness and creating something original and new, you do not need to seek copyright permissions to make your art. Nobody will give this without you paying exorbitant fees. It's like here on RGD, photos posted are used to create original works without having to sign anything over. You automatically own copyright to the artwork as it's creator even if it's some didney character or celebrity face you use.   another excerpt from comments RE: reproduction (mass production)   ""Reproduction,"" as I've described, does NOT refer to a hand-painted one-of-a-kind copy of an artwork, but rather refers to the manufacture and distribution of mechanically made copies (whether made with a desktop printer or a professional printing press). Copyright provides remedies in the event an artist's work is made available to a mass audience without permission, but obviously copyright isn't the Thought Police and can't prevent artist's from drawing whatever they want, and that includes copying the work of others or drawing characters that are copyrighted by others. Nor is it meant to be.    So if whatever you're making is not intended for mass production, you should be fine without model release forms typically used in photography. These wouldn't work in your case as the photographer is taking a selfie... they own the image but are essentially giving you permission to use it as reference - not use it to make verbatim prints, sell as stock image, etc."
ArtistLounge,34zzrl,zeruch,1 point,Tue May 5 23:34:44 2015 UTC,Love it. Would be perfect in my living room XD - my kinda colour scheme. ;) Could you tell us more about the process?
ArtistLounge,34xt5e,charliegrc,8,Tue May 5 13:26:49 2015 UTC,"Looks good. My suggestion would be that having all of your pencil strokes going in the same direction really causes the details in the face to bleed together, making it hard to really see where the eyes, snout (nose idk what you would call it on a deer) and other areas are. I would suggest looking at the direction the hair/fur lays in reference pictures."
ArtistLounge,34xt5e,Nadette,2,Tue May 5 15:56:49 2015 UTC,Awesome idea! I'll give it a shot soon and show the results!
ArtistLounge,34xt5e,theshadybird,4,Wed May 6 00:02:00 2015 UTC,"I agree with Nadette, stroke direction is a huge tool in drawing, especially with fur covered animals. Right now your strokes leave your buck looking flat and mechanical, but if you were to follow the fur and growth directions with your pencil it would put life and form into this drawing."
ArtistLounge,34xt5e,CuriosityK,3,Tue May 5 17:51:05 2015 UTC,"I think what you need is darkness. More dark lines! I would suggest crosshatching. It would allow you to get greater definition, so he really pops out of the page. You could get darker areas, and allow yourself to have the lighter areas stand out more. The drawing looks very good, and I think you're doing an awesome job."
ArtistLounge,34xt5e,drawn0nward,3,Tue May 5 18:23:39 2015 UTC,"Gotta agree with what everyone else had said so far, plus:  Assuming that realism is the end goal here, I would suggest changing up your mark making to include things like cross-hatching and pressure shading to denote the different textures on the deer; between fur, antler and nose. Also it may seem obvious, but draw the rest of the animal, and put it in an environment (even if that means just adding a cast shadow underneath), that will instantly give you more depth and flesh out your drawings.  And if realism is not the end goal, then you need to be more specific about what you're looking to improve and what you are working towards/inspired by. Are you looking to emulate a certain style? ""Find your voice""? What is the goal, exactly?  And finally, generally speaking, safe advice is to make your darks darker and your lights lighter. More contrast can be a simple way to help create areas of visual interest.  Hopefully that advice helps!"
ArtistLounge,34xt5e,Tasto86,1 point,Tue May 5 22:14:06 2015 UTC,"The eyes are really well done! Nice work.  Agreeing with everyone else my 2 cents is to clean up your edges and sharpen your pencil well, and often.  Looking forward to seeing more!  Keep it up"
ArtistLounge,34xt5e,Smiley_Dafe,1 point,Wed May 6 00:44:39 2015 UTC,"I kept the edges on the face rough to mimic like the hair, but yeah I agree the horns need to be cleaned up. Also its a pen not a pencil :p"
ArtistLounge,34xt5e,gemellion93,1 point,Wed May 6 00:48:30 2015 UTC,"I love this! It's really well done and I like the simplicity and icon-like route you've taken.  I would make the horns more distinct and as everyone here has mentioned, more darker tones and contrast overall. Also try and contour your shading and hatching around the subject. The right antler has that and shows more form because it follows all the turns in the antler. Whereas the left one looks a touch flat because the shading seems to follow one direction. Same with the face, if you can work the shading/hatching so that it makes areas like the eyes and eye socket 'pop', then it will really make the drawing work."

ArtistLounge,34v5eo,nyxinus,9,Mon May 4 20:41:30 2015 UTC,"I'm 45 years old and a full-time artist/illustrator. I support myself and my wife on what I draw. This is my website. I can give you some generic pointers, but keep in mind that I can't give you a tried-and-true, works-for-everybody formula...and, to be honest, understanding that there is no magic formula is the first step in becoming a full-time artist. It took me a long time to figure that out. With that said, here's what I did:  I used to be a full-time IT monkey, but I burned out hard and quit in a mildly spectacular fashion. It was easy to do, as my wife was a full-time Personal Banker so she was able to handle the bills while I got my shit together. Then we pooled our savings and bought a house free and clear. Then it was her turn to burn out and quit, and suddenly, we were starving.  Back when I had the full-time salary to fall back on, it was easy to drag my feet in my art career. But once it became my bread and butter, I stepped up my game. A growling stomach does wonders for your career ethic! haha  And that's Tip #1, I guess: if you wanna be a full-time artist, start being a full-time artist now. As long as you've got a Day Job to fall back on, you're not going to learn to support yourself with your art. Dive in with both feet and sink or swim.  Something that will help you become a full-time artist quicker is to surround yourself with other full-time artists. Make friends who support your career choice...and cut the naysayers out of your life.  Tip #2 is: HUSTLE! My comic subscribers cover about half to 2/3 my bills at the moment, which means I've gotta hustle extra commissions every month. That requires a work ethic, and if you've got a Day Job, your current work ethic is ""look busy, fuck off on reddit, dream about being a full-time artist"", and that's not a very good work ethic!  It'll be slow at first. You might not get a lot of work because people don't know who you are or what you draw or how reliable you are. You'll probably be eating a lot of beans and rice and ramen. It might get depressing. Fight through all that shit! The world isn't going to hand your art career to you on a silver platter. You won't get a trophy for participating. You gotta fuckin' HUSTLE.  Tip #3 is: cut the fat out of your life. There are 2 types of people in this world: Creators and Consumers. Right now you're probably more Consumer than Creator. If you're like I was, you buy a lot of needless crap to fill that empty void in your life from your Day Job and the resulting unhappiness it injects into your existence.  But you know what? That's okay. Your first six months as a full-time artist will go easier if you can hold some yard sales (or Craigslist or eBay or whatever) and trade your Useless Crap for some much-needed cash.  Reduce your bills! Find a cheaper place to live. Stop spending money on stuff you don't really need.  Tip #4 is the most important: Make being a full-time artist a pattern in your life until it becomes a habit. Make your deadlines sacrosanct. I haven't missed a deadline in 22 years, and this has earned me a reputation that gets me a lot of repeat business. I get a lot of side work and word-of-mouth referrals because some part-time illustrator flakes out on his deadline and now his client needs 3 pieces of Holy Wow Artwork in 3 days, and I've busted my ass to develop a reputation as the guy you go to when you need quality work Right Now.  This ""never misses his deadlines"" reputation is also what got me enough comic subscribers to live on. No one's gonna subscribe to the comic of one of those ""sigh I'm so depressed that I'm going on hiatus again"" artists. My readers know that they're getting their money's worth because every one of my almost 1000 comic pages have gone online on time. I'm Mr. Clockwork and they know that.  Tip #5 is: branch out! I don't put all my eggs in one basket. I do comics, sure, but I also have done medical illustrations for a Wilderness Medicine/Survival company out of Montana, and I'm currently doing illustrations for a pole dancer from Australia. I have a gig lined up this summer to do some custom graphics for a local snowboard company. Album art for local/indy bands also pays well! Best part is: all this side art is So Much Fun. Dude, you have no idea.  Best part about branching out: it widens your fan base. Fans of the bands and pole dancers and wilderness survival companies end up checking me out and becoming fans of my comics as well. Constantly seed your artwork out into the world but NEVER EVER EVER do that shit for free! ""It'll get your name Out There!"" and ""do it for The Exposure!"" and ""Draw this NOW and we'll pay you out of later profits!"" are the warning flags you should always listen for and avoid like the plague. Never EVER lower yourself for those shit ""jobs"". Respect your talent more than that. Respect yourself more than that.  Tip #6 is....""Draw More"" :) Seriously. Make a Habit of being a full-time artist. Habits are Patterns because Patterns become Habits. It's how your brain is wired. You're already drowning in habits both good and bad. You don't get to choose whether or not you turn Patterns into Habits. All you get to choose is which Patterns you want to nurture. So nurture the good ones! Weed out the bad ones.  Oh, one other thing:  Don't let anyone tell you this is a difficult thing to do. When I first set out to become an indy comic artist (back in the 90s, when everyone and their dog were making indy black & white comics), I only had two options: hope to get picked up by an indy publisher (which I did for a little while), or print my comics myself. That meant giving a local printer about $3K for 2000 (the minimum order!) cheap black & white newsprint comics that I would have to find a place to store till I could sell every last one of them in hopes of making my $3K back! It was a headache and a nightmare and really wasn't worth the time or effort.  But now? Holy shit! Now we've got the internet. Now we've got print-on-demand! Now I make my comic (full-color instead of black & white!) and upload it to Ka-Blam, then sit back and collect my money. And connecting with fans? Never easier! I have fans and clients from all over the world and it's easy-peasy to connect and talk with every single one of them.  There has never been a better time to be a full-time artist than right now. I'm constantly amazed at how much has changed and gotten easier for artists in the last 20 years.  These are all very generic tips, I know. Like I said: I can't tell you how You In Particular can become a full-time artist, because it's different for everyone. If you have any specific questions, though, please ask and I'll clarify as best I can."

My main concern is I cannot just quit my current job because losing the excellent medical care will literally be the death of me.

ArtistLounge,34lnxe,WhiteandPinkmakeBlue,2,Sat May 2 06:51:46 2015 UTC,"Here are some things that inspire me:   Movies with really cool action scenes or art style Music (can also be helpful when actually drawing) Just browsing art sites/blogs - but not too much.  If I spend too much time admiring the masters, I might start to feel a bit self-conscious.    I recently caught up with all my old artistic friends from HS and they all have gotten so good its crazy   It may be a bit disheartening, but I'd say you can use them as inspiration, too!  Try to look at them as comrades, rather than rivals (unless seeing them as rivals inspires you more).  Either way, try to learn from what they're doing.  Another thing I'd recommend keeping in mind is that while there are many artists out there, many are probably just cruising along art-wise.  If you're actively focusing a lot of energy on improving your art, you can improve in leaps and bounds compared to someone who just draws occasionally for fun.  I've seen people who were pretty much beginners make (what took me) years of progress in the span of a few months.  What is your default medium, and what are you wanting to branch out to?"
ArtistLounge,34lnxe,follymiser,2,Sat May 2 17:07:25 2015 UTC,"I completely understand how the cost of materials can be daunting when you just want to experiment with a new medium. Check your local community college for an evening/weekend class that includes materials in the cost. These classes are short term, fun, and comparatively much less expensive than credited classes. If you can't swing that, then choose a medium you'd like to learn and first buy, or check out from the library, a book about ""beginning with [medium]"" or some such. If you check it from a library, make a photocopy of the materials list. Use this list to purchase the supplies you'll need, one bit at a time as you can afford. Once you've got what you know you'll need you can experiment, go check out that book again and do some beginning projects.   If your ""default"" medium has been graphite pencil, try out charcoal, pastel pencils, conte crayon, colored pencils, watercolor pencils and ink pens (ballpoint, felt tip, whatever). These are less expensive than painting media."
ArtistLounge,34lnxe,the-tinidril,2,Sat May 2 22:00:29 2015 UTC,I find 2 things that really do it for me as far as re-sparking creativity: museums and a trip to the art section at the library. Neither of which I have done in a really long time.  I know it's easier to look things up on the computer but nothing beats seeing artwork in person. Or at the very least hold a book and read about how & why the artwork was created.
ArtistLounge,34lnxe,Smiley_Dafe,1 point,Sat May 2 22:02:03 2015 UTC,Try to buy used stuff off your local craigslist-y type site. I was able to get entire sets of paint off there for almost nothing. I didn't feel bad about wasting supplies so I could experiment with different mediums before I would invest in better quality ones. For a cheaper painting support I just used hardboard/masonite from the hardware store and cut it to size.
ArtistLounge,34jt08,sgt_mary_mary,4,Fri May 1 19:31:17 2015 UTC,"Great job!  I love the gif, since the color-layering process is what baffles me most of the time.  It's cool to be able to see what colors you added and when to create the final product <3"

Where they does leave you is potentially having to suspend your art from the ceiling (or the moulding if there is moulding) by putting some eye hooks above the wall. I don't know how much art you have to hang but it takes a loooooooong time to hang art that way.  What are the walls like? How high are they?

ArtistLounge,34aiul,follymiser,2,Wed Apr 29 16:49:37 2015 UTC,I'm not aware of any brick and mortar retailers I can purchase from. Wacom suggested that if it was purchased in a store then I could ask them to test it and show me it working. But at this point I just want to get it direct from Wacom.
ArtistLounge,34aiul,follymiser,4,Wed Apr 29 16:59:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah that definitely makes sense (purchasing direct from Wacom).  The response from Wacom is always a little amusing.

I read every review of the seller I could find first as mine was $2400 australian.  Buy from Wacom for the security given the problems you have and think of it as an investment rather than a cost if it helps. Cintiqs are fantastic things, however it's more about comfort and workflow. My actual art didn't improve because of the cintiqs, but it has in the time I owned it because o fi d the workflow easier and thus I can put out more art and that lead to inprovement if that makes sense.

These were just a small thing done for fun but I'm a little short on cash so I'll try so sell them. Probably on a kind of upper-class yardsale type of thing that happens here once a month. We'll see how it goes.   Definitely interesting how just doing those on wood adds so much depth, even though they are still flat. Also I'm as always interested in any critique and comments!"

ArtistLounge,344pve,ilovemrmiyagi,3,Tue Apr 28 07:47:01 2015 UTC,One helpful technique I use for drawing clothes in a digital space is to draw the entire model nude first and then 'hang' the close on.  The other thing is to choose your colors ahead of time and try to to deviate too much from your palette and don't change colors too often.  It leads to the values looking off with highlights in particular if the color changes slightly instead of just the saturation or brightness.

Honestly, a few lines of hair in a lighter shade would only take a few seconds. For a quick sketch it doesn't matter as much. In fact, it reminds me of Princess Ariel.

Today's show will be just myself and /u/funisher, so come and chill with us, chat about 42 and draw amazingness from /r/redditgetsdrawn  Oh and I’m really happy right now. No more squeaking, no more cutting out, yep you guessed it, I have a new tablet! The Cintiq that I have been dreaming of for years is now sat in front of me and waiting to create it’s first ever painting. =]  We will be discussing; how mediums such as comics and video games are viewed in the ‘high’ or ‘fine’ art world and how it’s changing and the purpose of critique and how it is viewed by different artists.   Hope you all enjoy the show."

ArtistLounge,341fj3,follymiser,2,Mon Apr 27 17:24:51 2015 UTC,I really used to suck at them but you just gotta practice a lot and stare at a lot of pinterest pictures of the kind of space you wanna draw (or stare at your own room!)
ArtistLounge,341fj3,follymiser,2,Mon Apr 27 17:27:58 2015 UTC,I've definitely been meaning to just try some drawing outside or perspective work.  I've always focused on subjects that I find it really hard to force myself to focus on landscapes/background.  I think I'll need to lock myself in a room and buckle down :)

ArtistLounge,3411jk,throwaway_regular,8,Mon Apr 27 13:40:28 2015 UTC,"Please define ""rejection"" some more. Is it that noone bothers to even write something to something you posted? Or is it harsh (and probably unreasonable) critique?   Well, I've gotta say that I don't really take any of the ""rejection"" on the internet very seriously anymore since I did my first real artshow. There was a guy with his wife who openly said to her (I guess he didn't know I was the artist, because I stood just two meters away) how crappy and pretentious my stuff was. That was hard. For a minute. I swallowed the bitterness and just told myself that it's just not his cup of tea. Who cares? At least he took the time to look at it and even spoke about it. He wasn't the only one that uttered stuff like this. Of course, there were people, too, who found my art awesome. However, that was the day I stopped caring so much about what internet-people thought about my pictures. Don't get me wrong: I love being part of this, I love getting comments, upvotes and the likes, but I don't take it personal anymore. It's the art that gets the comments. And not my personality (which logically noone on the internet will ever really know).  Believe me, I'm light-skinned and very close to the water. But internet-rejection won't hurt me. I learned that where there is internet, there are people who don't care about anything but themselves. I guess playing a heal in WoW has also made me stronger in my internet persona, since you usually are always blamed for everything that goes wrong."
ArtistLounge,3411jk,Onomaya,4,Mon Apr 27 14:40:10 2015 UTC,"Rejection in my case is in the category of in most of the posts no one bothers to reply or comment and the upvotes count as well.  I could not define clearly the level of rejection, but I can feel it. The general air of indifference. You know straight away your work has no impact whatsoever while some of the other works in the same thread get tremendous acclaims and the rest at least received certain positive response.  It is not about a particular thread, but a general trend observed over a period."
ArtistLounge,3411jk,Onomaya,3,Mon Apr 27 14:49:00 2015 UTC,"I guess the main problem here is that not enough people see your post in the first place. I'm not here for long, therefore I can't tell as much from my reddit-experience. But usually the longer I take to post something (and I usually DO take long, because the paintings just need the time) the fewer upvotes I get. Last week I did a good painting (for my standards), that received a total of 5 upvotes (including my own automatic upvotes). Why? The post was completely buried. Noone saw it. That is a tiny bit sad, but well, it's the way it is. Could it be similar in your case? Maybe you put more time into your work, took longer to post and noone except the OP and the mods saw it in the end.   On a sidenote: Did you ever hear about self-fulfilling prophecies? Maybe you build your own vicious perception-altering SFP over the time. The feedback got worse for a few works and you thought, it was your fault. Now you are in the loop by thinking, that your work isn't up to standards anymore, you are permanently blocking your creative intuitivity with those thoughts, you take longer to finish and even longer to post and the result you feared and predicted comes true once again and you get sucked even deeper into the loop.  I really don't know who you are and what your work is. Maybe post some of your work here in the Artist Lounge and get some constructive feedback which will make you feel good, worthy and able again. :-)"
ArtistLounge,3411jk,MeatyElbow,3,Mon Apr 27 17:30:12 2015 UTC,I totally agree with your opinion about Self-fulfilling prophecy:  I used to submit a lot of drawings (up to 20)  per week. Now after the art block you mentioned due to the stressful low upvotes count (I stupidly identified low upvotes as automatic failure). I can hardly produce more than 5 paintings per week.
ArtistLounge,3411jk,RichardMcNixon,5,Mon Apr 27 18:19:45 2015 UTC,"This is something I've devoted a little bit of thought to.  I think you've got to kind of figure out your own motivation for making art - or maybe just what your intended audience is going to be.  Why are you making art?  If you're doing it for others to approve of or enjoy you're probably going to get pretty mixed results.  Sometimes you're going to be more successful than others.  Maybe there's going to be a long string of pieces that don't seem to connect with anyone and are ignored.    If you're gauging your success by upvotes you should probably know that there's a lot that goes into that which has no bearing on what you post.  There's a temporal component, a lot of luck, weirdos that are actively gaming the karma system, etc.  Upvotes are, in my opinion, barely connected at all to the validity of artwork.    If you stick with it long enough, maybe you'll produce something that will get upvoted to the front page or the top of a particular subreddit.  Whether or not that's a function of your work or just a weird culmination of some of the factors mentioned earlier is open to debate, in my opinion.  I personally have produced paintings where the one that received the most upvotes was, in my opinion, far less successful than some others.  Another case might be that you're making art not for reddit as a whole, but for a specific subset of reddit (maybe a particular subreddit, maybe a subset of users that you interact with regularly, maybe a model on RGD).  You'll probably get some level of positive feedback here.  Someone is probably going to encourage you or upvote you or interact with you in some way that at least indicates they saw what you created.  The possible problem here is that you aren't getting an impartial view of your art - and it's possible to find yourself in an echo chamber.  I don't know how sustainable that is.  Encouragement is nice, but is it enough to keep you going?  I guess that's really your call.  A third case might be that you're doing art only for yourself.  If that's the case, you probably don't care about the upvotes or recognition at all.  You might not even post your work.  That may be great for the individual, but it doesn't do much to further art-specific subreddits.  If you're just lurking, you're probably not contributing to the community in any way.  If enough people do that, the community eventually dies out and goes away.  I don't know - I guess that's all a little vague.  I didn't really answer your question about how I specifically deal with it.  I guess I'm just saying that I understand where you're coming from and have thought about it some as well."
ArtistLounge,3411jk,RichardMcNixon,2,Mon Apr 27 16:10:51 2015 UTC,"I do not want to focus this thread on the merit of upvotes in assessing skill or progress of an artist as this has been discussed on a separate thread I made earlier in this sub.   From the result of many advices I received from that thread, upvotes are not an indication of skills or progress.     If you stick with it long enough, maybe you'll produce something that will get upvoted.   Maybe this is the course of action I want to take. I will try to ignore all the feedbacks, be it indifferent or negative, I will stop noticing the stellar success of others around me and stop comparing myself to them (although it is hard not to noticing all  that). I will keep persevering until a breakthrough.     Some of my random thoughts about contributing art in a public forum and the stoic discipline and unlimited perseverance required with it:  It is hard to contributing art -something very dear to your heart you made with hope and dream- repeatedly just to make up a number in a thread day after day, and your artworks are hardly noticed or acknowledged.   The patience required in art is an unlimited patience. Some people practiced art all their life and died in obscurity and poverty without any recognition by the public.  It is human nature to expect and hope for some recognition in a task which is done with strong conviction, effort, passion and devotion.  But in art and in art only, You are being told that You should not be expecting anything of it, or else You would be considered immature, weak-minded, impatient and delusional."
ArtistLounge,3411jk,MeatyElbow,2,Mon Apr 27 17:20:07 2015 UTC,"As i'm sure it's been covered, i'll be brief - coping with rejection on reddit comes down to a few major points:   Timing is everything.  Lack of attention is more an issue with timing as it is anything else... I posted on a submission from 1 day ago recently and I got one reply and maybe 2-3 upvotes.  You gotta think of how many photos are submitted each day... the further back you post the more it's going to get ignored.  Thankfully this isn't as much the case with the moderators as they'll see mostly whatever you post and we all covet those RGD mod favorite flairs :D... oh a good example of timing is /r/SketchDaily --- they start their new categories at 1am PST and if you don't post before 8am PST you'll be lucky to get 3 upvotes even if you painted the goddamn mona lisa.  Also, almost nobody comments on anything there. The insincere comment - that required ""thank you"" comment can sometimes feel like a boot to the head.  Fact is, not everybody is going to like what you made.  Mods can correct me if i'm wrong, but i believe the majority of posts are from first timers.  This means they have no idea what goes on here.  A bunch of these people have a specific idea of what they want to receive, and most of these posts don't get anything let alone what they want.  The ones who do get art have no idea how rare it is to get art from people and can be ungrateful.  How do i cope with this?  Just think of it like an insincere thank you for gift giving and leave it at that.  You made your art, your own satisfaction counts for more than their lack of appreciation.  I'll submit utter failures of pieces sometimes just because the person i drew isn't getting any art and i want them to k know that at least someone took the time. I thought i had a 3, but i think i covered it all, really.   When it comes down to it, there's plenty of ups and downs and you're going to get more criticism than praise if you're really paying attention.  I've gotten the super canned thank you, the no thank you at all, the downvotes (oh i hate downvotes), and yet i've gotten such over the top thanks, i've been called someone's favorite artist.... these moments aren't frequent, but they do really make it all worth it.  Guess you just gotta cope by keeping it up.  Someone mentioned to make it fresh - switch up the styles - pick up an entirely different medium and try that.  I tried painting.  I was horrible at it.  Made me really appreciate what i do in ink lol.  Hope all that helps put everything in perspective"
ArtistLounge,3411jk,RichardMcNixon,2,Mon Apr 27 17:43:27 2015 UTC,"Your post kind of open my eyes on the reality of how artworks are really handled and received by the public and the very nature of the audience itself in a reddit forum.  1/ Should rejection of an artist's work in a Reddit forum not be considered as a real rejection (because there were too many factors and because of inconsistencies of these factors)?   2/ Should I not base my emotional response, my happiness and misery on my artworks that are totally ignored, downvoted because the very dynamic nature of the above-mentioned factors which I misguidedly took as criteria for the assessment of rejection?  The conclusion is:  I may have used a total wrong criteria to assess the validity of rejection by a public on my artworks.  I understand now that the public of a reddit forum is not a reliable data, accurate, static and persitent enough to dictate my happiness or misery.  I have been suffering for a long time for nothing."
ArtistLounge,3411jk,silentlights,3,Mon Apr 27 18:11:45 2015 UTC,"lets put it this way - a lack of feedback does not exactly translate to real rejection.  a lackluster thank you is merely a required thing that people must go through, and only the opinion of the poster - one person - who is inherently biased anyways.  Presence of praise and upvotes, however should be acknowledge not because we're picking the good over the bad, but this is the only actual feedback we get.  I look back at the pictures that earned my highest praise often and pick them to pieces to try and figure out what i did right that time... lol  For your second bit, i'd say yes, you shouldn't base your emotional response on negative things.  I'm not a ""positive attitude"" person by any means, but I think that when it comes to RGD and Sketch Daily - the only things that matter are your own reactions to your work and the presence of praise and/or upvotes (less so with the votes in Sketch Daily).    So to your conclusion - absolutely.  Use this place as a guide to figure out what you're doing right rather than wrong.  Keep working to improve yourself and switch it up now and again to keep yourself fresh.    A little side rant on keeping yourself fresh: Too many people have determined their value as an artist based on the praise of their friends.  Friends are assholes.  They will blindly praise everything you do and never truly criticize.  The artists we see on these subs that maybe we deem as creators of crude malproportioned garbage (that's a bit harsh, i'm being purely candid here) are often victims of this kind of praise.  They will never improve unless someone acknowledges what they're doing wrong and they have the humility to accept this criticism and the will to do something about it.  Sadly, too often these people have been stagnant in their process for years and are more likely to be reincarnated into a good artist than change what they currently accept as their ""style""... something they judge as worthy because friends / family say it's good.... (people who couldn't draw stick figures properly) ... it's a bit loose, but that little rant kind of explains alot about the nature of the artist and the posters at the same time and hints at the whole worth of feedback here.    THAT SAID ... If you want real feedback - if you want to improve -- post here in /r/ArtistLounge -- we're not a big community and some of us (myself included) aren't super active, but you'll get 1-2 actual responses that will likely be better input than you'll get in months of posting to RGD / SD.    Post up an album!  Let us check your body of work - I get that this is an alt account for you - no need to link it back to these posts.  Just pop in sometime and let us at it~  You'll get as much advice as you need / want :D"
ArtistLounge,3411jk,RichardMcNixon,2,Mon Apr 27 18:49:29 2015 UTC,Regarding point #1 and /r/sketchdaily - I agree.  A limitation of SKD's format is that images that are posted earlier in the day will get more views (and presumably more upvotes).   I think this is probably hyperbole:   if you don't post before 8am PST you'll be lucky to get 3 upvotes even if you painted the goddamn mona lisa.   We can take one of your recent pieces as a counter-example.  Sketchdaily  <- 38 upvotes at the moment  RedditGetsDrawn <- 3 upvotes at the moment  Both are the same drawing.  I think that example kind of makes your point that when the drawing is posted influences the number of upvotes.  I just wanted to clarify that posting in a particular subreddit doesn't necessarily influence whether or not a piece is successful or rejected.
ArtistLounge,3411jk,silentlights,3,Mon Apr 27 18:21:35 2015 UTC,"that was the one that was posted on a picture that was a day old on RGD.  I was looking for something that would count for the next day's sketch daily. As for the sketch daily post, i set an alarm for 2am to post it.  That's right - 38 votes for waking up in the middle of the night to post.... that's how self conscious i am lol"
ArtistLounge,3411jk,Sweetstreetmeat,3,Mon Apr 27 18:24:15 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting thread (and if I recall correctly, there has been as similar one in artist lounge that sparked pretty interesting conversations). I've been wondering about the same thing for quite some time.   I haven't been an artist long enough to grow any kind of thick skin, so any critique cuts deep and fuels the whole crippling self doubt thing, making you feel worthless, all the beautiful things that come with art. I guess you just have to suck it up most of the time. I'm usually telling myself that every single piece of artwork, every sketch or non-successful painting brings you closer to the final goal. Makes it easier, since the time technically didn't go to waste. Then you're also working for yourself, not just the satisfaction of popularity."
ArtistLounge,3411jk,Sweetstreetmeat,3,Mon Apr 27 18:19:02 2015 UTC,"Out of context as hell,  but final goal?

ArtistLounge,3411jk,k0nundrum,3,Tue Apr 28 02:27:02 2015 UTC,"But there always are those goals you set out for yourself (to paint faster/bolder/tighter, start feeling the colours, use the fundamentals, make the perspective your friend, whatever you strive for), that's what I was talking about.

I should have followed these wise words long ago to spare myself lots of misguided misery and unnecessary anger towards myself.  In my misguided and futile chasing of external validation, I often asked myself  these very silly questions:  "" I spent 4 hours to paint this painting, Why don't they like it? Why didn't they appreciate my effort at least? Look how intricate and detailed it is. Why am I now at the bottom of the thread again?""  ""4 hours of my life and only 2 upvotes, my efforts are wasted, I am a loser, an utter failure!""."

I learned to perform at high levels under the worst conditions. We were not coddled and we were hardened like steal. There's no place for over thinking and indecisiveness when you prepare like an infantryman."

ArtistLounge,33wshl,AGamerDraws,7,Sun Apr 26 11:13:06 2015 UTC,"When I was in high school, I had this maniac English teacher who I still quote 8 years later. One of the things he would insist upon was that you don't try to explain something you wrote as you handed it in.   ""Res ipsa loquitor. The thing speaks for itself. Let me form my own opinion of it.""   I think that at the most, an artist should say how they feel about a piece, not how good it is. ""I'm not that happy with this"" is way more positive than ""this drawing fuckin' blows"" but really either way, you'll get it next time. I struggle with not talking shit about my own work constantly, because while I'm not always happy with what I produce, there are people who look at what I've done and they think it's amazing.  That being said, I think constantly wanting to improve is the healthiest attitude to have toward any medium of art. Whatever helps people motivate themselves to always be working to get better is cool with me. I'm not as tough on myself as a couple of people I know, but I've had some rough times, and I've never let it discourage me, and I don't tell OTHER people that a jacked up drawing made me fall asleep feeling worthless.  This post got away from me a little bit.  TL;DR use any motivation you can to get better but let your work, not your words, form opinions."
ArtistLounge,33wshl,fuckfaceprick,3,Sun Apr 26 21:44:29 2015 UTC,"I'm really glad you brought this up, because I think one of the hardest transitions an artist has to make is learning to see and critique their own art in a constructive way.  ""this sucks"" ""doesn't work"" ""just plain garbage""  these are things that we are used to saying about our own work, but if someone else were to say them, it would be completely inappropriate and not at all constructive.  why do we talk about our own work the way a complete asshole would?  why is that okay?  it's important to learn how to critique yourself in a constructive way.  learn how to pinpoint specific areas that need work and then work on them.  start giving yourself the critiques that you'd want from others.  be constructive.  be specific.  learn from your mistakes, but also learn to understand that some mistakes are wonderful organic occurrences that might just be the reason someone connects with a certain piece."
ArtistLounge,33wshl,art-broken,2,Mon Apr 27 22:10:07 2015 UTC,"I like your teacher's motto.  I definitely agree that it's so common for artists to want to preface their work, either apologizing for this or that or hoping the viewer will see things exactly the way the artist wants.  I think at the core of it that the desire to preface/explain/context art is silly (maybe unless you're talking about historical pieces that would only make sense with context on the times), since everyone experiences the same piece differently.  It's kind of the fun of it :)"

ArtistLounge,33wshl,Dmunman,3,Mon Apr 27 17:28:55 2015 UTC,"Just speaking for myself here. In my case it's that I have high standards for myself. I know where I want to be, and I can see that I'm not quite there yet, but I know I have it in me to get there. But it frustrates me that I'm not there yet. Does that make any sense?  I'm trying to break into the concept art industry, which is one of the most competitive scenes to get into. I see the work of my colleagues and I'd say I'm about average. Which is not acceptable. I need to be in that upper 25% in order to be happy for myself. So I push and I'm super critical of myself, partly because I don't really have anyone to be really critical of my work.  I look at my progress (or anyone's really) as a mountain to climb. There are times when your skill is improving, so you're climbing the mounting. There are times when you're not practicing or just not getting it, that's going downhill. Where I'm at right now is more of a plateau, where you're not really improving but you're not really getting any worse either. This is the most frustrating stage for me because it feels like I'm just rehashing what I know and not really learning anything really new or helpful. I've been in this kind of funk before, and it's never certain what will actually break me out of it. I think I'm starting to break out now with my latest study, but it's not enough to really inspire.  I dunno, started rambling a bit. That's my two cents at least."

ArtistLounge,33wshl,funisher,9,Sun Apr 26 15:57:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, everybody does get a participation ribbon. It takes courage to invest your time into something that can easily be criticized by a larger audience. Art most certainly is about personal growth, it's a contest against ourselves. We enter this competition knowing that we will sometimes be defeated, but regardless of our performance we should be proud that we tried and, even then, we all have different goals with our art.  Someone might want to see their work in the MOMA, while someone else just likes to paint a dolphin every sunday. Shit, I'll joke about either direction but I'll always commend the person for picking up the brush.  There are proper ways to critique art and help people improve, but it is important to keep their goals in mind and let them express their frustrations. Because it is their battle and their goals. For many artists it's a huge battle just to participate.  We were taught to believe that we need to toughen each other up, but I wonder sometimes if that is the right approach. It's important to be honest when asked but it is really starting to feel out of context to critique art that was presented in celebration. The difference between critiquing ""Struggling with my linework. Need help."" and ""Check it out! I made my first painting!"" Are we toughening each other up or just wearing each other out.  Maybe it's all in the delivery...  Let's face it, it's hard to make art fit into our lives, the last thing we need is our own peers knocking us down too. I mean damn, I screw that up all the time myself. We are naturally competitive after all. But the way I see it now, with the resources of the internet, and the immediate scale of exposure, it's pretty freakin' brave (especially for beginners) to participate in front of such a wide audience."
ArtistLounge,33wshl,funisher,9,Sun Apr 26 16:55:21 2015 UTC,"Yes! I think many artists forget that we are allowed to have fun. You are allowed to just enjoy the process and making your art. Not everything has to be critiqued, and it fact, it shouldn't be."

ArtistLounge,33wshl,k0nundrum,-1,Sun Apr 26 18:12:46 2015 UTC,"Do you want art to get less respect? Because that’s how you get less respect. I thought about this all weekend and decided to defend my reply.  I was one of three judges for a high school conference art competition recently. Each judge received a color-coded sheet to select our personal picks for first, second, third and honorable mentions. At the end of each category we’d share our selections with each other and discuss why we picked them. We could then change our minds or not. We then turned in our sheets for someone to rank winners. But, the host school didn’t give first, second, third or honorable mentions; they only put an “I’m a medal winner!” sticker on all the winning art.  I judged each category using a score sheet ranking the artwork from 1-10 based on the elements of art and the principles of art. The result was that the student who challenged themselves, gave the most effort, worked hardest to practice and apply the elements & principles of art were literally demoted to be equal with a student who didn’t work as hard or create good art. The First Place artists weren’t rewarded for their extra work and effort; and the honorable mention students were lead to believe their lesser efforts were amazing and that they were awesome artists. Where would we be if we neutered the champions in every vocation, business and sport? Who would we look up to and aspire to be?  I understand the purpose of the post was to encourage and motivate and that’s nice, but we all know that we’re not all “awesome” and much of our work is nowhere near “amazing”. You are never going to stop beginners with low self-esteem from saying their art sucks. It’s an age-old problem that’s never going away. In the book The Art Spirit Robert Henri wrote, “The work of the art student is not light matter. Few have the courage and stamina to see it through.”   If everybody wins – nobody does. Losing is part of the game. If you never lose, you are never truly tested, and never forced to grow. Ships in the harbor are safe, but that is not what ships are built for. We don’t learn by winning; we learn by losing. Adversity makes us smarter and stronger. I’m glad that art is hard. I’m glad it’s survival of the fittest and I’m glad it takes guts, hard work and perseverance. Adversity weeds out the askholes, the wannabes and the fakers. Overcoming challenges and obstacles make artmaking more rewarding."
ArtistLounge,33wshl,art-broken,7,Mon Apr 27 15:07:23 2015 UTC,"At this point in time I'm less concerned about how much respect art receives than where it's receiving it. So many wide genres of art have exposure that it one standard set of rules may not apply across multiple genres. I definitely agree that an artist should push themselves through struggle. That there is no shortcut to good work. That we are all entitled to our own tastes and opinions. That we can use the formal elements of art to build constructive critique.  But what I worrying about is using these tools as a means to manufacture a manipulated market. A market where an art school is more concerned about it's branding than education, where a gallery is more concerned about justifying inflated markets, where a market is not dependent on the massive resources of technology to increase the control an artist has over their own business, but instead to use that same technology to manufacture demand for high level investment.  I don't raise an eyebrow at harsh criticism to protect artists with thin skin. I raise my eyebrow at harsh criticism to question who actually benefits from a fractured art community. To not ask why one piece of art is better than another, but why it actually matters. I want to take a step back and start thinking about what contexts critiques are appropriate and who they are serving. I think these issues at their root lead to answering why it took so long for comics to be a respectable art medium. Or why videogames are still struggling to reach that goal.  We were trained to debate issues like these. Do we defend them or oppose them? As I'm getting older I'm beginning to feel like skills toward criticism weren't used as a means of growth, attack, or defense, but as a means to create issues that shouldn't exist at all. To fracture and classify genre so it can be used as a market tool that can apply classes and stratify creativity into a business that can protect monetary investment. In other words, if we protect this piece of art in a shell of artspeak, we can build a market so esoteric we can manipulate it's value and hide from a public that might ask why? Ever notice that the more mainstream an idea is the easier it is to critique? It's something that has really fucked with my head. And definitely an idea that makes me have to come to terms with parts of myself that are so quick to praise rarity over mass appeal.  I don't go easy on critique because I'm scared of hurting feelings. I go easy on it because I no longer want to be the guy criticizing the flowers at a wedding. I'll give a critique when someone asks, but I'll leave it at rest when someone else wants to celebrate an accomplishment. I have no idea if it's the right approach, but as of right now, the only solution I can see to help keep art honest, to defend it against pride, markets, and manipulation, is to celebrate its creation more than its appearance.  Edit: BTW, I love The Art Spirit! I think that book should be next to every artist's bed. We gotta talk about that book man!"
ArtistLounge,33wshl,art-broken,-2,Mon Apr 27 15:51:46 2015 UTC,"I'm less concerned about how much respect art receives than where it's receiving it.   If individual artists don't maintain a standard for the discipline then no one owes the vocation any respect. Like politics, all art is local. To propose that we're all ""awesome"" and ""amazing"" equates the profession to the Special Olympics.    the only solution I can see to help keep art honest   And keeping art ""honest"" is saying we're all amazing and awesome? You and I both know that's not being honest.  Edit: I actually keep the book next to my keyboard."
ArtistLounge,33wshl,art-broken,8,Mon Apr 27 16:13:24 2015 UTC,"I didn't know there was something wrong with the Special Olympics... Anyways, I'm not opposed to artists pushing themselves and receiving helpful feedback to their work. What I am opposed to is giving feedback in the wrong environment and actually inhibiting an artist's growth. This tends to be a very specific situation for a sub. Reddit is a bizarre venue for art, somewhere in between classroom, studio, and art show. So if someone posts art in celebration, a critique would feel salty and out of place. If someone asks for help, then it is very much encouraged.  And I'm not saying were are keeping art honest because it all looks amazing, I'm saying we keep it honest by celebrating that we're making it in the first place. The encouragement that it was created should be emphasized more than the critique."

ArtistLounge,33sbfg,throwaway_regular,8,Sat Apr 25 03:35:22 2015 UTC,"I completely disagree. I don't think upvotes or even necessarily downvotes translate well into how ""good"" your art is.   I really do think that getting those upvotes or downvotes is heavily influenced by timing of the post and a few other things, like certain styles. I, for one, have had far more upvotes on some of my earlier posts- because I was one of the first replies- as opposed to on some more recent works, because I took my time and posted later. If you reply late you simply aren't seen as much and you won't get as many upvotes. You can hardly equate that to skill.   Further, I think sometimes people just like the style of one piece over another. A couple of my drawings I did in pixel art. Because it was so different from what we normally see, the first few really got a lot of attention. Personally, I think these pieces are worse than my usual work and were just sort of riding on a gimmick (and that's ok!). If you make something similar to a lot of other works, you might not get as much attention. That doesn't mean the piece isn't good.   There are probably a lot of other factors, but I really don't think not getting votes means your work is bad. Getting votes, on the other hand, might be showing you did something right. But you can still do things right and just not get the votes, that's just the way she goes. In the end, I think it's better to just make art for art's sake, and let whatever response that follows, follow."
ArtistLounge,33sbfg,poleis,3,Sat Apr 25 04:01:26 2015 UTC,"I understand the dynamic factors of Reddit karma. But I have watched the overall change in a decent interval of time, and the result therefore is quite consistent in my case.  I agree with your statement on just to make art for art's sake.  I was doing so well with that carefree mentality until I let the vanity of Reddit karma and a ""total dependence on external validation as a single source of motivation and purpose of making art"" get into me.   I hope I can still find whatever inspiration and motivation left to drawing just for myself, for the sake of art as before. The pursuit of external validation had worn me completely out and has given me a crippling inferiority complex. I hope it is not permanent."
ArtistLounge,33sbfg,funisher,7,Sat Apr 25 06:56:30 2015 UTC,"Nononono no! Don't stop right now. For starters you have improved, you've just adjusted to your rate of improvement so it wasn't as noticeable to you. Think of it this way, ever think about how your family looks the same to you as you grow up. Then you see that old photo or home movie and your like, ""Wooooaaahhh weird! We were so little!"" You don't notice the rate of change when you adjust to it.  And secondly, if you have been (in a feels like) a rut you're are right on the edge of a break through! So for the love of god stay in the game! Improvement in art works in plateaus. Usually some form of breakthrough happens in technique. Something just clicks and everything starts rocketing forward. Eventually it feels like things are stagnating but what's actually happening is that you are growing comfortable with the new techniques so they feel old. Kind of like once you ride the bike it becomes second nature. Well now comes the boredom. And that's the best part, it sucks to actually go through the experience but what's actually happening is your brain adapting to a routine. What will happen is to your creative drive will drive a wedge in that routine! It's one of the best parts of being an artist. Against all forces in the world telling us we should find the easy route we can't help but to throw a wrench in the gears and see what happens! And you are right there!  All you need is to pick up that different brush, or the weird pen that's been hanging out in the back of the drawer. Everything will feel off and funky, then, suddenly, another breakthrough! Something will click with that new tool and the rocket reignites. Sure it's a mess of a journey and complete emotional beatdown, but that's what keeps the art fresh. You are right there!  Now, how does this relate to upvotes? RGD is a constantly evolving organism. It's taste is constantly changing and artists fall in and out of that rhythm. It happens to all of us, and thank god it does! Think of it this way. In a more micro example, ever notice how when one person submits a baby or a dog and whole handful pop up at once? The first OP sets out an idea that is then picked up by others. The rate of growth of those submissions increases as the dominance of the theme takes a larger percentage of the front page. Eventually enthusiasm wanes and the theme fizzles out. During this time an artist that doesn't care to draw babies won't shine. Maybe during this time the baby fans preferred charcoal instead of digital, or vector instead of PS. It may be stressful for them, but when everyone grows tired of drawing babies that artist is gonna be primed to kick off the new jam. An OP will submit a fresh idea and they'll dive on it with that new weird pen from the back of the drawer. That feeling will come rushing back. Those rockets will be on full Kerbal Space Program cray and you're gonna be singin!"
ArtistLounge,33sbfg,funisher,2,Sat Apr 25 05:00:14 2015 UTC,"Thank You for your analysis on perception of progress. I do feel I might be fallen in this category of ""settling in with a process and dare not venture out of it due to fear of failures and rejection but then facing with a dilemma of becoming boring and stagnant"".  When the comfortable and steady process which gave me some good feedback and validation of the past in terms of upvotes has become less welcomed and upvotes were falling in a steady rate, I was getting panic and desperate.  I decided to try out new techniques, process, styles even gimmicks in a forceful and and laborious manners  with a purpose of gaining back public favors and that gets me into further troubles.   The more I changed my styles and process. The worse the responses would be. At times, I was feeling as if I was slapped in the face after submitting a piece (which took me hours upon hours) due to the coldness it was received.  The downward spiral was complete and now I am at the rock bottom creatively and inspiration-wise. I dreaded contributing now for fear of failure and further discouragement by the cold fact.   I am afraid from now on every drawing I submit (no matter how much effort I put into it) is automatically in the bottom of the thread with single digit upvote.  I no longer draw or paint with joy, inspiration and with the carefree attitude of the past which has shown me so much self-confidence and driving improvement. I draw and submit every drawing with fear of the moment when I checked it back later with bitterness  to find it at the bottom again.  The fear of failure has paralyzed me at the very moment I started a drawing. I drew with the anger with myself, with frustration and torment of why I could not find the way back into the public favour of the past. I drew and paint a piece for hours and hours to punish myself for not being as good as before and the result ends up confirming it which in turn kills off whichever inspiration left for a next drawing. I dig a bigger hole for myself each time I tried hard to get out of it."
ArtistLounge,33sbfg,headcrab1991,2,Sat Apr 25 05:31:29 2015 UTC,"You gotta remember that when the style switches you are starting from scratch with the new direction. It takes time for your voice to develop. One way to ease this transition is by trying not to force the change in the style. Just change one simple step in your process. Remove one of the brushes you use frequently. Or change up the paper. Let the adaptions work in increments.  Some cases call for a drastic change but it sounds like in your instance you are flailing, making yourself sink deeper in the quicksand.  Also, take a break! I hate to tell ya this but you can't quit art even if you tried. Sure, you can think your done with it, but you'll come right back. The good thing about that is that you can take a break! Watch some movies, listen to some music, etc. Give yourself a vacation to be a turd. This isn't to let your skills refresh, but to let your brain stop racing. You won't come back with all the answers. But the mistakes won't be as overwhelming. It hurts to fail on an art piece your really emotionally invested it. What a lot of people don't understand is that it's not just the emotion of dealing with a failed drawing, but a complete failure in something you love. Like your art just broke up with you.  Take a break. Let yourself heal. And when you start back up draw for yourself first. And when you come back to RGD, submit without looking at the karma for a while. Just make a drawing, submit it, and move to the next. Think about the practice of drawing and not the result.  And most importantly, I'm not here saying these like I got it all figured out and don't feel the same way many times. A few nights ago I failed three times in a row on a drawing and then just went to bed super pissed. We may not be able to make the catalyst of those emotions disappear, but we can most certainly practice the way we manage them. You won't be in this hole forever."

Also if I see one more Ironman, Heisenberg or majestic roaring Lion I'm gonna hurt somebody..  The vast majority of the upvotes come from non-artist.

ArtistLounge,33sbfg,Dmunman,3,Sat Apr 25 12:15:22 2015 UTC,"I believe some upvotes are given by artists in the sub as well.   Definitely but if you look at the ratio of participants/lurkers to artist it's safe to say that, especially the bigger posts, are mostly upvoted by non-artists.  Good that you don't give up!"
ArtistLounge,33sbfg,Dmunman,5,Sat Apr 25 12:34:14 2015 UTC,"Others have spoken with much better words than I may be able to, but I feel compelled to say something, yet all I can help but say is ""no no no no no no no no no no no no!"" in my head.   ""In your opinion, do you think upvotes amount on Reddit for your artworks ultimately determines your improvement/regress status in drawing?""  Not in a million years.  There are too many variables, too many factors that affect what points you get. How visible was the original submission? How are people feeling that day? How many people even viewed that submission? Did OP see all the comments? When did you post? Do you up vote every image you like on reddit, if not do you think every one else does? How many times did someone just open it, think ""that's cool"" and move on with their life? How many people are lurkers?  No. Do not base your opinion on your skill on so many ridiculous variables. And even if it has gone over a series of weeks or years, there are still too many variables. There is art that millions of people hate but is worth millions of $$$. If something isn't a naturally appealing style, that doesn't mean that isn't filled with skill and passion.  Instead look to whether YOU like your artwork. And if you don't like it ask yourself WHY. Walk away from social media for a while and if you find a place, such as reddit, effects you far too negatively (either psychologically or with your creative freedom) think about whether you really want to be posting your stuff. Maybe you need some time to remember why you enjoyed art in the first place, without all the eyes of the public, and then come back to it when you are feeling secure.   Even if I make a piece that doesn't sell, has 0 up votes and gets completely missed by the OP, if I enjoyed it, hell, if I even LEARNT from it, then it was not a waste of time. And if I like it, then at the end of the day that is all that will ever matter. Even if I hate that drawing, at least I drew something, adding to my visual library and my motor memory, so that a future drawing will be something that I do like.  If you truly feel that you are lacking in skills, then go scrub up on your fundamentals. Do some gesture drawing or practice drawing something you struggle with. Have fun and improve.   I personally find that it helps me to just make the art, post it out there, and then walk away. Never check the up votes, the likes or the favourites. Respond to the comments when they come in and maybe share it around a bit more if i'm really proud of it. But it can just be easier to walk away and not compete with the other artists in the thread. Art isn't even something you can compete with because it's so subjective.  There will always be other artists who are better at something than you. But they will never be better at being you. Use what you know, your experience, your life, your unique skills and style and push your work further so that when someone sees your name they know exactly what will be there. And even if there are tons of people who end up disliking your work, there will always be that one person absolutely loves it.  I really hope that you find yourself in a better and stronger place soon, i'm sorry if this a little bit of a ramble, but I needed to say something."
ArtistLounge,33sbfg,Dmunman,1 point,Sat Apr 25 17:45:53 2015 UTC,"Thank You for your very illuminating words which has enlightened the darkness of pessimistic thoughts surrounding me...  I know it is wrong to take upvote/downvote too personally.  I know that it is wrong to expect to have the high amount of upvotes all the time, it is arrogant and it is impossible as nobody wins all the time. I do not have the ambition to have that level of success. I just interprete my constant bottom position of the thread as a subtle message from the audience that they were sick and tired of me.  I saw many stellar regular artists with consistent track record of success, every post is guaranteed top post and weekly selection of best of. The amount of skill and talents of these artist are so robust, their upvote count is so steadily high that the upvotes has -for the first time- entered my mind as a criteria for me as a measure of progress, it makes me question my own rate of failures and it has confirmed me that my skill is actually regressed.  I know there are many dynamic  factors for the upvotes, but seeing some artists with very consistent rate of success over a long stretch of time. I think the upvote amount must be somehow accurate to reflect the progress/regress of skill level.  When everybody moves forwards and I am the one that was left behind. I have to re-valuate my progress issue."
ArtistLounge,33sbfg,somnivision,3,Sat Apr 25 19:33:59 2015 UTC,"Forgive my honesty, but you sound paranoid. You really need to think about how this is affecting your mental health. Why do you like to create art? Create it for that reason, and that reason alone. Not to please randomers online, otherwise you will be trying forever, because fans are fickle and fame is short.   If you genuinely care about the progress and skill in your art then post to subredits, or contact artists you can trust and ask for constructive, fair critique. Find out your weaknesses and fix them. Don't base it on the random luck of a forum like RGD.  The only person you can compare your art to is yourself. No one else. Just because someone else has way more up votes, doesn't mean that they are better. It means that they appeal to the current audience on reddit more that day. You may have a completely different audience. If one artists makes cute, fluffy pink animals and another artists paints gore and depressive imagery, they are never going to have the same audience. Your audience may just not be seeing your artwork at the moment.  ""I believe people just try to tolerate me and my hideous excuses of so-called artworks.""  ^ THIS IS NOT TRUE. Even if you are the worst artist in the world this is not true, because you are providing something that you put time and effort into as a gift with no benefit to yourself. You are giving a piece of yourself and your time, and that will always be admired. At worst people just don't care. They probably don't care about us as people, our daily struggles and how we feel about each piece. Most people probably just see it is there, nod in satisfaction, and then carry on lurking.  You will not fix your work by running away and calling yourself a failure. Look at your life, your health, your mental state and your relationship with art and choose to do what will be best to make you a happy person. If that means walking away from social media then do it, but if you want to continue sharing your work, consider reaching out for advice and criticism where people can actually see your work and try to help you and put you in the right direction.  Look at what everyone is telling you and REALLY LISTEN TO IT. Instead of dismissing it, realise that perhaps you should re-think the way you are thinking about this situation."

ArtistLounge,33kjsi,anushreesanthosh,15,Thu Apr 23 07:07:18 2015 UTC,"""Promoting"" art is relatively easy, people love looking at art, but finding your specific target market who buy art is really the challenge.   First, your title asks about promoting art through Reddit. In my experience, and from what I've read in trade magazines, social media is the weakest marketing strategy. While it may be free, the return on investment (ROI) is weak because social media is a time sucker and for any business time is money.  My website's host ranked art-marketing factors that make the biggest difference marketing art. Here are their top factors:   Quality of artwork Physical Shows/Openings Face-to-Face meetings Juried Exhibits (being juried into them) Artist's Website Brick and Mortar Gallery   The lowest ranking factors included: Facebook, online galleries, artist's blog, and lastly Twitter. What we learn is that people standing in front of the work and who meet the artist face-to-face are more likely to buy the art. As far as social media, including Reddit, the bottom line is ""What gets measured, gets managed” or in other words, what you focus on determines what actually gets done. If you focus on the number of Facebook followers or “likes” you have, you’re going to optimize your art business to get Facebook followers and “likes”; if you focus on ""upvotes"" on Reddit, you’re going to optimize your art business to get Reddit ""upvotes"". Likes and upvotes my be fun and stroke your ego, but they won't pay the mortgage or buy art supplies. But instead if you focus on the quality of your artwork, you're going to become a better artist, and in the end, better artists sell a whole lot more art, even without Facebook & Twitter followers and Reddit upvotes. The bottom line is: don't confuse web traffic with real progress.  Three years ago I downloaded a list of 24 things on ""How to Sell Art"". Number one was ""Get good at making remarkable art."" Number 22 & 23 said, ""Go back to step one."" I spend downtime on social media for fun and it has some educational value, but I focus the lion's share of my time on step one."
ArtistLounge,33kjsi,hollyhooo,3,Thu Apr 23 13:47:57 2015 UTC,"Well written.  Completely the opposite in my case, every single one of my sales is because of social media. REALLY depends on your medium"

ArtistLounge,33kjsi,AGamerDraws,1 point,Thu Apr 23 23:26:06 2015 UTC,"Wow.. I really appreciate your sincere and thoughtful input!! And I have to agree with you too. Truth be told, I am not social media savy at all. Infact I spend very little time on it. Which is probably why I was foolish enough to have my actual name on my account while everyone else seems to take pains to hide their identity. I do not know how to go about promoting my artwork on social media, which is why I was hoping for inputs like yours to get more insight.   I have been through some serious medical madness and art has been my best medicine. It has and still does give me alot of peace of mind. I do not consider myself pro by any standards, but I do believe I have a unique creative style. My work is completely original and I do not copy anything. So while I understand ""go back to step 1"", I would also give to share my art with ppl who like it and get critique from ppl who dont, so it helps me grow.   Here is an artwork of mine if you would like to see: http://anushreesanthosh.com/featured/tree-of-life-anushree-santhosh.html . If you like it, you can click next to see the rest of my work. Thank YOU once again for all the input. I am going to rely more on shows, exhibitions and meeting ppl rather than social media, like you suggested."
ArtistLounge,33kjsi,AGamerDraws,2,Thu Apr 23 14:27:49 2015 UTC,"This is why it's important to define what success means to you.   If the goal is to ""share the joy"" then you may put more focus on Reddit ""upvotes"" and Facebook ""likes""; but if your goal is to sell artwork then upvotes and likes will be very low on you're priorities.  Consider this: if your primary focus is to ""share the joy"", then that is a simple and achievable goal. But know, if you're sharing joy, people are less likely to give honest critique and will just say nice things and compliment you. None of these will challenge you to improve.  On the other hand, if your primary focus is sales, you still get to share, and you become highly motivated to improve your skills. There's no critique data that is more reliable and measurable than a sale. Good question and good luck.  Edit: By the way, your greeting cards appear to be free."
ArtistLounge,33kjsi,AGamerDraws,1 point,Thu Apr 23 15:10:20 2015 UTC,"I get what you are saying but I dont fully agree. I can share the joy AND want to make sales. I dont think strangers (who dont know me at all.. I have'nt yet shared my site with family and friends btw), have any obligation to make me feel good about myself by posting nice comments because I wrote I want to share the joy. So I disagree on that front. I am not looking for upvotes or likes, but if it comes because I made good artwork (I dont disregard it as crap, but look at it as encouragement from strangers).   I posted the question to learn how to go about promoting my work because I do not know.. and I am here to learn. I hope to understand the process as I create my artwork. I sell cards only in packs of 10 and 25. Single cards are not for sale, thats why it says $0. What did you think of my artwork?

ArtistLounge,33kjsi,follymiser,3,Thu Apr 23 15:48:31 2015 UTC,"Online strangers do not have any obligation to either make you feel good or make you feel bad. They actually don't care. I looked through the comments on your artwork. All of them have a long threads of seemingly heartfelt comments that include praise and words like: marvelous, amazing, lovely, beautiful, exquisite, etc., etc.. Yet, no honest feedback and I'm going to assume the majority of them did not buy a print. So, you have to ask, why is that? Here's why. In reality, they comment because they've been told that commenting in other's online forums will increase their visibility and will drive traffic to their own website. They're marketing.  10 Ways to Get 100 Extra Visitors to Your Website Today see #8  How to Increase Traffic to Your Business's Blog including using social websites to make connections, be involved in relevant online groups and communities, and comment on other people's blogs, etc. etc.  ... and many many more ....

ArtistLounge,33kjsi,ugocapeto,1 point,Thu Apr 23 16:46:06 2015 UTC,"I agree. I want to make sales and ppl may have ulterior motives to comment but you are focusing more on things that are irrelevant than what I asked for. I never said I am counting comments or likes or even mention them in the first place.. I merely said, it doesnt matter and I would see it as encouraging and not something to mock or disrespect (after you brought it up). That aside.. I havent made sales yet because I havent completed my site yet or announced or promoted it in anyway. The comments you see are only from ppl who happened to come across the artist website. So my aim is to promote the site with the right audience, hence my post here and start of the discussion. I am merely learning now so like I said, I hope to do it right and get sales as a result.   What did you think of my artwork? And do you know of forums or likely buyers of such kind of work? Where would you start promoting or who would you meet with my kind of art? These answers would help me if and when you have the time.. I would sincerely appreciate it."
ArtistLounge,33kjsi,hollyhooo,3,Thu Apr 23 17:03:08 2015 UTC,"my aim is to promote the site with the right audience   Just like millions of other artists. The trick is to find the “right audience”. To do that, you’ll have to do some market research. You may discover your target market is not internet savvy and doesn’t buy anything online. Perhaps they buy everything online but only at one place?   And do you know of forums or likely buyers of such kind of work?   No. As I said, social media is the weakest marketing strategy and traditionally the lowest return on investment. You literally compete with thousands of other artist doing the exact same thing and most of them are better than you and I. This is why I say the best way to share your story and sell your art is physical shows/openings, face-to-face meetings, juried exhibits and a brick & mortar gallery.   Where would you start promoting or who would you meet with my kind of art?   Your clients and my clients are going to be as diverse as our artwork. What works for me surely will not work for you. Here’s what I did: I started displaying my art anywhere I could. I made notes of who bought my art. After some time I began to notice a pattern of: who, what, when and where. This is the start of the hard data for your target audience. Once you have a basic profile, you can plan a marketing strategy. Where do they shop? What newspaper/magazines do they read? If I were selling artwork depicting Odissi dancers, my marketing strategy would be to start making a mailing list including people who love Odissi dancing, music, costumes and jewelry. There’s your market. When you have a gallery show then you mail them a postcard invite. Perhaps have Odissi music or a dance performance at the opening? You have to do your homework."

ArtistLounge,33kjsi,vholecek,2,Fri Apr 24 03:34:08 2015 UTC,No problem. You are very smart to begin a marketing strategy. I will say that my comments are my experience only and that some (like other comments here) do find online strategies suit them. They key is to put your time and effort into what works best for you.
ArtistLounge,33kjsi,vholecek,3,Fri Apr 24 13:09:57 2015 UTC,"In my personal experience it's about getting your name and artwork known in the circles you wish to sell it. Then people will choose to look at your work rather than feeling like you are shoving it in their face. Reddit doesn't really like self promotion, but it does like supporting cool people and cool projects. If you can show people that you aren't only on here to sell work, but happen to be a cool artist then you will do a lot better than someone who uses reddit as an art dropping site."

I just pulled up the photo on my pc, and just followed the contour lines from what I saw. All of the work I do (except printmaking) is totally freehand. I looked at it while I added the details from the middle image. It just takes time, and a lot of patience!"
ArtistLounge,33hszu,eh_me_ree,2,Wed Apr 22 19:13:19 2015 UTC,Blind contours always frustrate me. Therefore I feel a lot of admiration towards your work. :-)

ArtistLounge,33j157,Brassawiking,6,Wed Apr 22 22:26:50 2015 UTC,I like the concept of this thread. It would be cool to see a whole bunch of different artists offering CC.
ArtistLounge,33j157,AGamerDraws,1 point,Wed Apr 22 23:19:17 2015 UTC,"You could argue for why don't I just comment on the other posts. Firstly, in a IGF thread there can be a specific type of feedback. A really good water color artist might give exclusive feedback on water color only.  Secondly there will be a better engagement from the person giving feedback. I will get a notification if someone ask for feedback. That makes it more personal.  Lastly, this will only give artist one feedback response, but it will be more guaranteed and of better quality, compared to posting it to the group and hoping someone will answer with something more than ""well done""."
ArtistLounge,33j157,AGamerDraws,1 point,Thu Apr 23 06:30:04 2015 UTC,"I think the only thing that annoyed me was that you set up a very 1 on 1 thread, and then immediately left. It's the kind of thread that needs /r/casualconversation rules in order to work. Otherwise, opening a feedback thread that anyone can comment on, but that is limited to just CC rather than random comments would work, as artists can drop in and out depending on their time zone.  I've seen similar things work well in /r/writing, but the ones that did well the original person told you their experience. It may help to give a piece or artwork in the explaining comment and also say your expertise in order to show why the feedback has weight. (Eg: a uni portfolio examiner is going to get a lot more responses than a random internet artist)."

I would experiment with larger brush sizes in order to vary your stroke width. I think it would help in this piece most with the sternum area where currently you have many smaller strokes to build up tone, which is a bit distracting to the eye,"

ArtistLounge,3387um,mrsuperflex,13,Mon Apr 20 12:47:52 2015 UTC,"As a working artist it doesn't sound like you're ""stealing paying customers"" or anything like that.  If people are satisfied with low res images and balking at $50 for the original sketch they wouldn't have paid for anything.  So I wouldn't worry about that angle of things.  On the other hand if you're looking for a way to start incorporating paid work be upfront about different tiers of service.  If you're comfortable doing a quick sketch for free but require payment for things like providing the original, revisions or specific requests from the client that's reasonable.  Any time you are changing your process only because the recipient has asked for it they should pay for the privilege."
ArtistLounge,3387um,EctMills,8,Mon Apr 20 13:12:12 2015 UTC,"Also a selling artist here.  I agree with the other commenter.  It's on the other artist to make something that someone will want to buy.  If you are displacing his market by providing free, low res drawings, then he doesn't have much of a market anyway.  Aside from that, I think what you're doing is really cool.  You're giving people access to custom-made art.  Maybe one day, those people decide they'd like a higher quality picture, the original, or even a painting or something from another artist.   And you get the practice and joy of knowing you made someone happy with your drawing.  Honestly, if you don't mind doing them for free, that's the most important factor."
ArtistLounge,3387um,Spencypoo,5,Mon Apr 20 14:19:52 2015 UTC,Another selling artist chiming in here to tell you that what you're doing is 100% awesome! I sell art AND give away art for free. It's a fantastic way to build up an audience and fan base and there's nothing wrong with it at all. Kudos to you for having the guts to share your work and the dedication to make art every day!
ArtistLounge,3387um,ajmck,2,Mon Apr 20 17:54:40 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot.. I really appreciate your comments everyone!
ArtistLounge,3387um,WallHop,3,Mon Apr 20 17:57:13 2015 UTC,you're hustling - it's a good thing.  As the demand of requests increases - don't be afraid to slowly but surely start charging a fee.  Keep up the great work though
ArtistLounge,3387um,Onomaya,1 point,Tue Apr 21 12:45:52 2015 UTC,"Lol, yes I am presently in the process of doing the hustle ;) For the moment, I think that I'll stick to the ""low-res scan for free"" and asking a realistic price for originals and a little more effort put in-model. It's primarily something i do to learn, and getting a lot of free publicity is an extra bonus.. It's true that it would be publicity aswell is i were to charge a fee.. maybe I'll do that at some point !"
ArtistLounge,3387um,Onomaya,3,Tue Apr 21 12:52:44 2015 UTC,"Just one hint I can give from selling both commissions and ""art"" is the following: Don't charge super-cheap fees. Charge reasonably.  I did commissions on fiverr for about 6 months (until I was almost facing a burn-out from all the requests) and it taught me one thing: Those cheap bastards (sure, there are people who just CANT afford more and those were nice to the max, but the rest...) who got sketches for 5$ (which were really worth about 35-50$ on a realistic scale) were much more likely to complain an/or insult me than those whom I charged a reasonable prize on my own website. There is a term in psychology that describes that phenomenon. If people pay little for something they automatically assume that that something really isn't worth much. If you charge reasonably they are more inclined to see you as an artist and that the stuff they bought really is art. To wrap this up: People whom I sold stuff for 5$ complained about the stuff I did for them whereas people whom I charged 500$ were super-happy."
ArtistLounge,3387um,Onomaya,2,Tue Apr 21 13:40:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that comment.. That's an important lesson i guess. The pricing is also a part of defining yourself as an artist.. I have had some people be a little too demanding in regards to their free sketch.. That's something that I need to keep in check constantly, because while I'm just doing it for fun, people quickly seem to think that I ""owe"" them a service.. I'll still take a look at that site.. Fiverr - haven't heard of it.. Did you mail your buyers the originals?"
ArtistLounge,3387um,Spencypoo,2,Tue Apr 21 13:50:50 2015 UTC,"I did send them the originals if they bought the additional gig for that. That was the smooth part. Fiverr is also very reliable with its payments. Never had any trouble with that. I sold mostly mini-illustrations, mini-portraits and drew tattoo-concepts (that one was my favourite). While some customers were really fun people wot work with, some were just too demanding as you put it. Those would give you a bad review for anything. Fiverr was too much pressure for me and I wouldn't advice it. Except if you have an already finished product that only needs to be sent off."
ArtistLounge,3387um,Spencypoo,2,Tue Apr 21 13:59:54 2015 UTC,Maybe I'll try it for a period when I get some more time.. I see that there are plenty of offers for 5$.. Is it possible to use that side for anything costing more than five bucks? How much did you charge for the originals?
ArtistLounge,3387um,JNKill,2,Tue Apr 21 14:05:11 2015 UTC,"Sure it is. There's always the basic gig, which equals 5$ (of which you get 4$) - e.g. I offered a small (Din A6) basic tattoo concept sketch for that. But there are also the additional gigs that a customer can book (for 5, 10, 20 and 40$ if I remember correctly). you can offer multiple of those. For example: 10$ add. gig - I'll offer a colored sketch; 20$ add. gig - The sketch is twice as big and more detailed. 40$ and I'll do A3 full detail concept drawing. I only offered the shipped gigs for portraits. There the basic gig, was 5$ (+ shipping cost). So these people could buy an original for 5$.  Besides the mean customers fiverr has two more downsides: 1. you sell almost nothing as long as you aren't a superseller (which is some kind of achievement you get for selling 100 gigs and getting NO bad review). 2. As soon as you are a superseller you can offer the additional gigs and will earn more money, BUT  you have to deliver in time. Always. And if you get 10 gigs one day and 15 the next (which has happened to me) you still have to deliver in time. No matter if you have to spend time at your dayjob or your kitty needs to go to the vet. That is the thing that broke me down. I'm not overdramatic here. It was by far the hardest job I ever had."

ArtistLounge,333zau,kempsridley,2,Sun Apr 19 16:47:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I'm not so sure it's my personal favorite, but I think it's maybe a top ten piece. I've mostly done solo portraits, so I thought I'd go with this one to mix things up and try something new. Proportioning was the hard part for me, and I can tell that it's off a bit. I think I did.well on the hair shading, but the hair structure is off on the left girl. I did learn a lot about expression though, and the whole piece was so much fun to draw.  but I'm still pretty bitter"

To take that a step farther, joann.com has a set of plastic drawers with a rolling metal frame. 5 drawers of varying size and color, with a metal top.

I came in here to pressure you to make more turtle ones :) similar to the turtle with the world on it's back is turtles all the way down which might be a cool idea! I know next to nothing about felting, but these look fragile. Is that so or are they pretty durable?"
ArtistLounge,32wf5z,kempsridley,1 point,Sat Apr 18 15:56:50 2015 UTC,"Turtles all the way down:       ""Turtles all the way down"" is a jocular expression of the infinite regress problem in cosmology posed by the ""unmoved mover"" paradox. The metaphor in the anecdote represents a popular notion of the myth that Earth is actually flat and is supported on the back of a World Turtle, which itself is propped up by a chain of larger and larger turtles. Questioning what the final turtle might be standing on, the anecdote humorously concludes that it is ""turtles all the way down"".  The phrase has been commonly known since at least the early 20th century. A comparable metaphor describing the circular cause and consequence for the same problem is the ""chicken and egg problem"". The same problem in epistemology is known as the Münchhausen trilemma.    Image i - The humorous anecdote holds that the world is carried by a chain of increasingly large turtles, and beneath each one is yet another: it is ""turtles all the way down"".

I usually like having one or two fun felts to do while I'm also doing commissioned work.   My felts are always durable. I make them so you can hold them and pinch and poke and prod and nothing will happen. Heck, you can tug on the wings and they won't move much. (obviously not yanking on the critters is the best idea.)   I assume kids will play, so I don't make mine to be little flowers. It may sound conceited of me, but I see a lot of felt work that looks very, um, delicate and I refuse to work that way. It takes a lot more time to make a durable piece, but the quality is so much better."
ArtistLounge,32wf5z,kempsridley,2,Sat Apr 18 19:26:46 2015 UTC,I can't believe how tiny some of them are! I looked through your etsy shop and saw the itty-bittiest little bird in the world. Kudos for having the patience and making them durable :)
ArtistLounge,32wf5z,ZurinP,1 point,Sun Apr 19 00:06:07 2015 UTC,"Thank you for visiting my Etsy store! I love making them tiny, miniatures have always been my thing. When I did ceramics back in the day, I always did little bitty things. Felting is more fun, though. I can spend less time fussing with clay, which endlessly needs care and maintenance, then needs kiln work and glazing, and can just poke stuff and it looks how I want.   Anyway, I forgot where I was going with this...   I like miniatures, and it's been a thrill to find a medium that works so well with them, and is easy for me to work with. I tried doing tiny drawings and paintings but... I am a terrible 2-D artist, especially with anything realistic, haha! Some of my drawings are so, so bad :p"

That's exactly along the lines of what I'm looking to accomplish, so thank you for the relevant input.  I installed the tablet today, but it appears the girls are playing hide and seek with the digitizing pen. =("
ArtistLounge,32wps1,somnivision,4,Fri Apr 17 18:27:36 2015 UTC,"A 2B pencil, kneadable eraser and a stack of cheap printer paper is enough to get started. I would stick with traditional media until you develop some drawing skills. Tablets are not the same due to the disconnect, cintiq is a bit better but at this point it's just more tech getting in the way of learning.   Old school drawing classes typically start with larger pads of newsprint & charcoal sticks if you want to go that route at home. On larger canvas' it's easier to measure your proportions and spot errors vs. drawing small on a4 / a5 sketchbooks. Try to attend some live figure drawing or start out with some still life set up for some focused practice. Apart from that just draw the things you like to keep you interested in art instead of burning out on academic exercises. Some of these are quite mundane and boring but necessary evils for improvement.  You can scan your sketches and experiment with color digitally but again, try to keep it as simple as possible at this stage. Try using markers or oil pastels which is kind of what sikefoo emulates in their work. Have a look at other mediums as well, you'll just naturally gravitate towards that one medium that you can't put away :)"
ArtistLounge,32wps1,CuriosityK,3,Fri Apr 17 16:00:04 2015 UTC,Second graphite recommendation w/ knead eraser.  I think I'll start there with the set that /u/scribbling_des recommended.  I'll also take your advice to color digitally.  I really like that idea.  It lowers the footprint of things I need to carry around with me and allows me to use ctrl + z as a crutch while I play around.  Thanks!
ArtistLounge,32wps1,CuriosityK,4,Fri Apr 17 19:05:37 2015 UTC,"If you want to doodle, the best way to start out is to buy a small notebook, one that will fit in your pocket or your purse and you can carry around with you everywhere. Then get a mechanical pencil that's not an expensive as hell one so if you lose it you won't cry. Buy a few of these pencils. Plus erasers. Stick the notebook in your pocket along with the pencil and draw. Draw everywhere. Instead of flipping on your phone to look at something while you're bored, pull out that pencil and draw something, whether it be something in front of you, or something in your imagination.   Back when I drew, I bought a bunch of those tiny spiral notebooks you can get for 60 cents at a dollar store and doodled in those. I still have a bunch laying around. Now that I'm a felter, I have a tin of wool and a needle set and I felt everywhere I go. Always do your art, and always have a way to do your art in your downtime.  As for the digital stuff? I have no clue. I'm terrible at digital artsy fartsy stuff. :D"
ArtistLounge,32wps1,kempsridley,5,Fri Apr 17 16:11:10 2015 UTC,"This is exactly the plan.  I'm the type of person that would rather be super early than have people wait on me.  I pick up my daughters from school everyday and generally sit in the car for 20-30 minutes (prime parking, padding for traffic conditions, etc).  I pass the time on my phone and had that empty feeling of wasted potential.  A couple of months ago, I started carrying a notebook and pen with me to jot down notes and ideas.  I've since created an vague outline of a story in a sci-fi setting.  Now I'd like to flesh out the characters and world and would love to use sketches to explore ideas instead of words.  Thank you for your two cents.  I appreciate the insight."
ArtistLounge,32wps1,CuriosityK,1 point,Fri Apr 17 18:34:09 2015 UTC,"Welcome! I have the same thing going on. I have a notebook and pen in my car all the time, too. I used to be a lot more into the idea of writing a story, but my time's been so overloaded with felting I haven't thought about it as much. I have this character in my head that needs a story, but... eh. I'll get her story written out someday. :D  Cell phones are awesome, but man, they are a time sink. I taught myself how to felt basic shapes without having to look at my fingers and not stab myself all the time so I can make stuff while standing around. Helps me feel so much more productive than my old habit of being semi-social while doing mindless tasks on the phone."
ArtistLounge,32wps1,scribbling_des,3,Fri Apr 17 18:49:21 2015 UTC,I love the idea of bringing a notebook for times otherwise spent looking at my phone. Less time wasted on my phone and more doodles for practice and inspiration...win win! Thanks!
ArtistLounge,32vgxm,friedburger93,3,Fri Apr 17 01:22:00 2015 UTC,"A really solid first attempt!  There are 2 things here, though. The figure drawing and your charcoal work. I could suggest things for both.  The figure shapes seem kinda stuff. You could try and do some gesture drawing or work on contours to help with that. A good example is the lower back. You have it as a sweeping arc, when in fact, there are lots of bumps that run along the back where the muscles of the back are. Noticing and being able to put those in will give it more of a natural look.   For the charcoal, work on layering and building up tones. You can put down charcoal to make an area darker, but then blend it in. This can go along with what I said above about the figure. Follow the lines of the body and the muscles with your strokes will help give them definition."
ArtistLounge,32vgxm,MacAnthony,2,Fri Apr 17 18:32:07 2015 UTC,thanks!!
ArtistLounge,32vgxm,CuriosityK,1 point,Fri Apr 17 21:10:44 2015 UTC,"Seconding what was said about putting in charcoal in darker. It's been a while since I've done a lot of charcoal, but it's got the same quality as watercolor paint, once the medium is on the page, it isn't coming off easily. (without a lot of eraser!) This means when you work with it, you have to focus not just on where your darks go, but where the lights will have to stay, i.e. the places where the charcoal isn't.  As you get more comfortable with it, you learn how to judge the areas of contrast of light to dark better, and charcoal is awesome at this. It's one of the best mediums for learning how to see gradients.   The form of the back you drew isn't bad at all starting out. You can do more! When focusing on a seemingly simple surface like the back, take careful note of the smallest of changes in dark to light and concentrate on adding those to the drawing, not just the broad changes that occur due to the back being a simple cylinder shape."

ArtistLounge,32u0pd,k0nundrum,13,Thu Apr 16 18:29:34 2015 UTC,"I've started looking at RGD as more of a resource of photos to develop my skills and try new things and to learn from other artists. I love the fact that somebody else will get to see and enjoy what I made as a result, but it really is a secondary benefit for me. Regardless of whether or not you get any feedback at all, you still made something that most importantly you are proud of and probably learned a lot about a new style or technique along the way that will help make your next piece even better! Don't let acknowledgement or lack thereof slow you down.  Also don't take anything personally as people have different ways of interacting with the internet that have nothing to do with you. They may not check reddit everyday, be in a different timezone, or maybe they saw your picture and then before they replied they accidentally switched tabs and got distracted looking at pictures of baby goats and only later when they're making dinner or in the shower the next day realize that they didn't reply...happens to me all the time. You never know!"
ArtistLounge,32u0pd,kempsridley,5,Thu Apr 16 19:05:47 2015 UTC,"That's a very reasonable and healthy way to look at it. Thanks for the reframe. :)  I know that looking for external validation is always a recipe for disaster, but it seems like one of those lessons I have to keep relearning."
ArtistLounge,32u0pd,CuriosityK,5,Thu Apr 16 19:09:07 2015 UTC,"You really do have to stop looking for the validation and acknowledgement to keep going, especially from Reddit. It's a simple fact of the model that is this website that people don't always put the time in, not with the upvote/downvotes. One of the best ways I try to combat it is by putting the time in myself to comment on other people's work because I know it means a lot. How many other artist's posts do you fly by a day with 0 comments that you just go ""eh"" and not even bother to look at it? If that was your work, would you really appreciate a comment, even if it was constructive criticism?  It feels awesome to get people to comment on your stuff. But if it doesn't happen, don't take it harshly. Life probably got in the way, just like life got in the way of you commenting on the hundreds of other posts you see every day. Even if it's something personal and close to your heart doesn't mean it is to everyone else. Keep your work personal, and work for your own betterment. Make yourself proud.   P.S. I think the line drawing worked better in the RGD because the detail on the eyes is nicer in the drawing, with the eyelashes and the arch of the eyebrows. I do like the cartoon version, but the roughness of the drawing conveys more depth between the eyes and nose, and the eyelashes make for something more visually interesting. Both versions are well done, though."
ArtistLounge,32u0pd,CuriosityK,2,Fri Apr 17 07:21:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for taking the time to respond and look at both drawings. The general consensus so far has been that the rougher line drawing is more interesting than the vectorized cartoon drawing.   Regarding commenting, I actually do make a big effort to upvote and comment on other people's work, and when I've posted a photo in RGD and people have been so generous as to draw it, I have thanked them profusely. So the issue isn't about that; in fact, it's probably made worse by the fact that I'm so fastidious about it, and it's hard for me to understand why someone else would blatantly ignore someone else's generous gift (because I see all of our free art on RGD as generous gifts of time and effort.)   For me, it's really about letting go of that need for external validation of my own stuff from others, particularly in the case of an OP who thanks the other artists, but doesn't acknowledge me. It also drives me crazy when an OP acknowledges mine, but ignores someone else's... in that case it's not a personal ego-bruise, but it still raises my hackles."
ArtistLounge,32u0pd,kempsridley,2,Fri Apr 17 07:30:11 2015 UTC,"I 100% understand where you're coming from. I still really want people to tell me they like my stuff, it's one of the reasons I post my stuff on Reddit and all the other places I post my stuff. I like that feeling of likes, upvotes, or whatevers. But man, I've made some stuff over the years that I thought would get a great reaction and got no reaction at all... I had to learn to just give up on expecting any response at all. When I stopped expecting responses, I started making stuff for my own enjoyment and giggles. It became a lot more fun to make things then.   I might be rambling. I've had like 3 hours of sleep here. I read your post before I went to bed and had this really awesome reply and now I'm up and guh too tired. Anyway, I agree with you. It's all something I struggle with too, but have to let go of. Imagine I said something deep and introspective here. Yep. I need coffee."

ArtistLounge,32u0pd,drawinglearner,2,Thu Apr 16 20:40:39 2015 UTC,It is often true in my experience that the original sketches have a lot more character than the finalised or digitised versions.

I just save posts with photos that I like and work from them lately.  I rarely finish anything so I don't worry about posting.    As a representational artist, I have often had trouble finding things to work from, but RGD has really gotten me back into drawing.  Used to I would just comb the Internet for photos to draw, it often would end up being celebrities, but I hated searching for something, so I didn't do it often.   For me, RGD is a godsend.  And feedback is nice, but it doesn't bother me if I don't get any."

It's when they responded to other people on the thread, and skipped mine, that I get all wiggy.   The mods to a great job, though I'm pretty sure there is no requirement to thank everyone, just to thank at least one."
ArtistLounge,32u0pd,drawinglearner,0,Thu Apr 16 20:51:20 2015 UTC,"there is no requirement to thank everyone, just to thank at least one.    That's correct, it's too much work to monitor every post, and to say ""Hey, you thanked scribbling_des but not k0nundrum! Get back in there and thank her!"" Then we would have to monitor whether or not OP actually did it. It's just not feasible.  However, when an OP offends artists by thanking some but not others, I am again always willing to share my disdain with OP. I think anyone who doesn't thank every artist profusely is scummy, but that's just my own hardened opinion that has developed and grown over the past three years."

ArtistLounge,32kqmy,Ceraphyn,3,Tue Apr 14 16:03:33 2015 UTC,"Honestly? Wreck it a little bit. Chip away at the ears, scuff the paint, stuff like that. The signature look of the splicer masks comes from the mirror it makes to Rapture itself. Something, once lovingly crafted, is now tattered and wrecked. The beauty has turned down right creepy.   Don't get me wrong. It looks amazing. It just takes a little willful destruction to make it truly Bioshock-y."

ArtistLounge,32kqmy,CuriosityK,2,Tue Apr 14 22:43:58 2015 UTC,"I agree that it needs some wear and tear. I think the perfection of it takes away from the look of the mask, in a strange way. That or it needs more colors than just the black and gold. The painting of the mask is simplified, which I can totally understand, but it hides a lot of the beautiful shapes of the mask itself, the ridges over the eyes, for example. If the black matte of the paint were to be scuffed, or if there were to be some shading painted in, some of those highlights would come out. Now, mind you, some of that might be a hell of a lot more visible on the mask outside of a picture, and I might just be talking out of my arse because pictures never do 3-D objects justice.  I'd maybe add a 3rd contrasting color. Red is an obvious choice, same with silver. A really rich blue maybe, if you don't want to go with red. Or purple, for royalty. :D"

ArtistLounge,32eyie,BlockBlockGoose,1 point,Sun May 10 05:09:26 2015 UTC,"There is no strict formula.  I have a tool chain of analog and digital tools that I fold over each other somewhat differently each time.  Depending on what I fell on more during the process tends to make it lean more analog or digital as I go, but its not really quantifiable.  Basically I start with analog building blocks: things painted or drawn on surfaces like paper, cold press board, masonite, canvas, etc, as well as software generated bits...I then scan the analog bits or print the digital bits and work the analog bits digitally or paint over the digital printed bits.  Then it gets all rescanned and resampled...then stuff happens. Then things.  Then something finished.  That probably didn't help a lot did it?"

ArtistLounge,32crl2,tee-hee111,2,Sun Apr 12 18:21:54 2015 UTC,"I should preface by saying I'm not much of a digital artist myself, so take my suggestion with a grain of salt, but I think the contour lines are kind of in an awkward middle ground. I love the color and expression but the thin and loose contours seem to sit on top of the image instead of as a part of it. Either using heavier and more minimal solid lines, or pushing the nervous tension of the small sketchy lines and going nuts with it could be really interesting.  I'm also curious what you think of the Mischief. Particularly in comparison with any previous apps you've used. Mischief is the vector program that draws like a raster program right?"
ArtistLounge,32crl2,funisher,1 point,Mon Apr 13 14:27:44 2015 UTC,"Like /u/funisher, I am not very digitally experienced. But!...  The expression and flow of the drawing is excellent. It conveys the feeling well and shows skill in that area.  What is distracting is the sketchy-ness of the lines. I'm not sure how to overcome this, since I have the same problem in digital, and try to get around it by scanning in an inked drawing or avoiding lines altogether.   The color scheme suits the piece well, but feels too flat, probably because the shadow areas are so close in value to the lighter portions.   In short, try cleaning up the lines and pumping up the contrast.   Good work! :)"

ArtistLounge,325e0o,nyxinus,3,Fri Apr 10 18:48:14 2015 UTC,"Here are my thoughts, please take with a grain of salt :)  I like your vibrant use of color when you have a good balance between warm and cool. The first pic with the glasses is a good example along with the last pic of the cat.   7th pic with the girl and dog is the weakest. Excessive use of pure black is overpowering and the hatching technique used on the background seems uncontrolled. A darker, desaturated hue mixed from the colors used in this palette would work better as a ""black"" vs. using actual black. (Hopefully that made sense lol)  3rd pic - hooded woman. The way some areas are colored in seems rushed. Looks like markers? Try blending with alcohol (or water depending on your marker) to cover the area completely and to help transitions between hues.  I've seen your previous work with watercolor and I feel you're quite good at glazing and wash techniques especially when you load up on pigment. These don't really translate well with markers unless you do a bit of blending which, may be difficult depending on the paper you're using. Based on this set, it looks like you're experimenting with a more graphical style using line work to define edges. If this is the case, try working on line economy by using more negative space and implied lines to give your washes and glazes some attention.  Hope this helps."
ArtistLounge,325e0o,somnivision,2,Fri Apr 10 20:41:43 2015 UTC,"balance between warm and cool   Thank you for pointing this out! It explains what feels missing in some of them.   A darker, desaturated hue mixed from the colors used in this palette would work better as a ""black"" vs. using actual black. (Hopefully that made sense lol)   So true! It does make sense, and would be much more interesting :)   Looks like markers? Try blending with alcohol (or water depending on your marker) to cover the area completely and to help transitions between hues.   Yep, mostly Copics. I'll try using alcohol to blend it out. That's a really good idea, and could solve some of my frustrations with them. I was trying out pens with the idea of doing quick portrait-caricatures at fairs. Do you think the sketchy style is okay for that setting, or is it too unfinished?   try working on line economy by using more negative space and implied lines to give your washes and glazes some attention   You are so right, and I will definitely focus on improving this.   Thank you for the advice! I appreciate the time taken :)"
ArtistLounge,325e0o,somnivision,2,Fri Apr 10 20:50:04 2015 UTC,"You're very welcome!  watercolor paper tends to suck a lot of ink from copics and do not blend so well... Try synthetic papers like yupo or limestone paper as an alternative to that weird smelling marker paper. If nothing else, bristol board vellum works ok. Basic technique is to lay down the alcohol first, then copic on top or swab it around after for some blending fun.  The sketchy style can work well for a short session as it's more loose and has an interesting level of abstraction that's appealing to most people. I don't feel it' looks too unfinished or anything (technically, all art is actually unfinished) and with a bit of development, you'll know what you can do comfortably within your time frame."

ArtistLounge,325e0o,CuriosityK,2,Fri Apr 10 21:39:49 2015 UTC,"I think what you have tonality wise is good throughout what you showed us. You seem to have an intuitive sense for color however anatomically speaking you run into some perspective issues when drawing portraits in an 3/4 view. I mostly see it in the eyes, the one further from the viewer tends to creep up, what I would recommend would be to draft out your composition before actually executing the piece to fix this issue. The eyes should come to the same distance vertically regardless of position in a 3/4 view the only thing that might be distance of the eye horizontally. I hope this was helpful."

ArtistLounge,323cpc,funisher,2,Fri Apr 10 06:20:26 2015 UTC,"Some quick tips:  duplicate the background layer to keep the original in your file for reference!  set layer blending mode to ""multiply""  to keep the inks. It's kind of like a coloring book this way.  If you're in photoshop or something similar, you can use the magic wand selection tool to mask off areas like the background you're working in or do the reverse like color in the inked areas instead.   Use the liquify tool to nudge areas you feel are out of proportion.  Also, awesome drawing! :D"
ArtistLounge,323cpc,somnivision,3,Fri Apr 10 11:51:28 2015 UTC,"That multiply feature! Oh man, when I first learned about it I was like ""Ah man, I could saved so much time!!!""

I slowly fiddle with different tools here and there, but they're quite the mystery most of the time."
ArtistLounge,323cpc,somnivision,0,Fri Apr 10 17:23:52 2015 UTC,"Yep it's handy for keeping lines from the original. Other than that I have no idea what else it's good for haha. PS is the kitchen sink of image manipulation but honestly it sucks for painting...   Anyways, another blend mode you might like if you want to bring out some texture is luminosity. Dupe a layer, set to luminosity, then filter->sharpen->unsharp mask. Adjust parameters to taste. This is a useful sharpening technique that keeps noise to a minimum.  Also, when blending colours in PS... if you're want them to blend naturally like they do in a digital color wheel it helps if you're working in LAB mode. This plugin is the shit and it still works in the CC version too."

ArtistLounge,323cpc,kaisengaard,2,Fri Apr 10 08:18:38 2015 UTC,I was planning on working from a completed drawing and perhaps start by cleaning up some lines and adding some minimal color. Maybe I should be really focusing on working all digital for this one. It would translate better to print...
ArtistLounge,323cpc,kaisengaard,2,Fri Apr 10 14:26:47 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's bad or problematic going from traditional --> scan --> digital, but it might make less sense (at least to me) to go for a ""completed"" drawing before scanning.  I'd recommend getting a gist of the composition and some mostly refined lines for the physical, then adjust proportions/comp and ink/re-ink digitally.  This way you won't have to worry about cleaning up the lines traditionally too much, and you can just make some easy tweaks to proportions/composition digitally (which is way the hell easier than traditionally).  Try to leverage what's best about both mediums :)"
ArtistLounge,323cpc,kaisengaard,2,Fri Apr 10 17:29:41 2015 UTC,"After I did this warm up drawing I though about the way I hatch shadows and realized I'll probably have to ditch that, which is a shame. I luv hatching :("
ArtistLounge,323cpc,kaisengaard,3,Fri Apr 10 17:32:00 2015 UTC,"You don't have to drop the hatching completely :)  What you can do is hatch on the traditional drawing, scan, re-ink only the lineart onto one layer, then reference the hatching on a separate layer for shadowing/etc.  You might end up not using the hatching in the final product, or you can just change the form of the hatching into something less fine (like using hatched brush strokes as opposed to hatched pen lines).  Not sure if I'm making sense...."

ArtistLounge,323cpc,AGamerDraws,3,Fri Apr 10 18:05:44 2015 UTC,"Well dog balls are my fetish, so... j/k  I love hatching, and I think the hatching on this piece looks great.  However, hatching definitely gives art a specific feel.  If you're doing a collaboration, I'd probably ask if the atmosphere the hatching provides jives with what you're going for.  In other words, it's not a question of whether it looks good (because it looks amazing).  It's a question of whether it matches what mood you're going for.  I think the noir-like feel mixed with the hatching in this case provides a sort of mystery/suspense graphic novel vibe.  I half expect the facing page to be a shadowy figure standing in the hallway.

ArtistLounge,3207xj,rouxpanda,2,Thu Apr 9 15:14:21 2015 UTC,Touch Twin Markers are so similar to Copic that Copic sued them.   I cannot tell a difference between them and Copic plus they are half the price.  You can even use Copic ink to refill these markers and vice-versa.   I noticed they are available on Amazon and a few other places.   Good luck!
ArtistLounge,3207xj,xrainbow-britex,2,Sun Apr 12 19:41:54 2015 UTC,Thank you!! I looked them up and this is exactly what I was looking for!
ArtistLounge,3207xj,AGamerDraws,1 point,Mon Apr 13 00:07:07 2015 UTC,Have you tried looking on amazon or JetPens?
ArtistLounge,3207xj,kyleclements,1 point,Thu Apr 9 16:29:48 2015 UTC,JetPens only have Copic sets and on amazon they are more expensive.
ArtistLounge,3207xj,kyleclements,1 point,Thu Apr 9 17:59:29 2015 UTC,"Prismacolor?  They have a brush pen on one side, fine nib on the other.  Similar to Copic, but they don't go down so flat.    Copics look like a computer 'paint bucket' tool, while prismacolors look more streaky and markery."

H... heh...   ._.  One thing I'm running into is that I feel like I have too many to-dos and very little time to do them.  I'd like to do a longer project, but I'm also working on some rather fundamental stuff (learning color theory, getting more familiar with photoshop, etc.), so any art I may make now might be quite different than what I do later.  Honestly I just think I need to draw draw draw.  I have very little art output these days.  I think it would be fun to do something like a webcomic or something.  Little things like figuring out fonts and how to get cells to look normal on a page (even digitally) often escapes me... there are so many fundamentals to cover!"
ArtistLounge,31ub4t,chrisconlon,4,Wed Apr 8 05:14:33 2015 UTC,"Hey all! Thought I'd give a little insight as to what goes into my recent cartoony work.   Here's a quick explanation!   SKETCH: The sketch phase is where I get a general idea of the layout and content of the piece. It gives me a chance to develop poses and make sure everything balances nicely compositionally. I do this in Manga Studio and colorize the lines to keep things less confusing for me. If a costume is particularly complex, sometimes I'll colorize certain line elements within an individual figure so that I know how things are layering. LINES: This is the finalized line work after I've sorted out the compositional layout, posing, and costuming. This stage is the most time consuming stage, as I have to build up the line weight and make sure it balances out and gives a good sense of form. FLATS: The colors without any shadows, highlights, or lighting effects. This will gives me a general idea of the color scheme. If these colors don't balance out, then things can get really frustrating in the next phase. FINAL: The final stage! Here I establish a light source and do my best to give the figures three dimensionality without making them look overly realistic. Lots of artful elimination of detail here as I've previously worked in much more realistic styles! I also try to communicate the texture of the various materials in the piece while still staying in the bounds of the style.   Anyway, hope you like it! This is what I show clients when I'm commissioned to do portraits in this style."
ArtistLounge,31ub4t,nyxinus,1 point,Wed Apr 8 05:22:28 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the explanation! I love seeing the process, and sometimes the steps seem so magical that it's hard to follow.  Do you put each step on new layers? And is the lineart an overlay or just a normal layer?"
ArtistLounge,31ub4t,nyxinus,2,Thu Apr 9 21:03:11 2015 UTC,"The lineart is just a normal layer. Each ""area"" is its own layer, best illustrated by the ""flats"" step. The shadows and highlights of each area are on the same layer. Everything is set to normal unless there's some special glow effect (see the ghostly glow in this piece), which is set to ""screen."""
ArtistLounge,31ub4t,indigochamp,1 point,Thu Apr 9 21:07:47 2015 UTC,Thanks for the explanation!   I love your concepts. Reminds me of D&D!

ArtistLounge,31l5l8,ObeyMyBrain,1 point,Mon Apr 6 06:42:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Love your piece!  It's funny you should ask about the moped thing because I looked into it before I posted the title. From what I've gathered, it largely depends on how many cc the engine is. A moped generally has an engine under 50 cc and tops out at or around 25mph, whereas a scooter has a more powerful engine that allows riders to travel faster on major roadways. They look pretty much the same, but they are distinct from each other.   ...and this is why my brain is filled with random bits of knowledge I'll never need to use again because I drew something one time"
ArtistLounge,31l9qb,somnivision,3,Mon Apr 6 03:28:38 2015 UTC,Done for this RGD thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/redditgetsdrawn/comments/30uqwo/my_sister_taking_a_break_during_a_shoot_to_have/  Tried a different approach with my colors on this.
ArtistLounge,31l9qb,funisher,2,Mon Apr 6 03:31:48 2015 UTC,"I love being able to look through progress pics. I wish people took them more often. You mentioned that your approach with colors this time was different. What did you switch up? Or more specifically, how did you approach the new process? I find that lots of times it comes down those itty bitty rapid fire decisions while painting. Where to hit those swatches of color. What was on your mind when that brush hit the canvas at those times?  I sure hope my question made sense because it's been a long day and I'm not so sure it did. :P"
ArtistLounge,31l9qb,funisher,2,Mon Apr 6 04:35:15 2015 UTC,"You're right - there are these little moments when you catch yourself doing the same thing but stop and purposely go in a different direction just to see the result. I guess the major things I can point out was actually using black paint along with greys and greens which are colors I typically avoid. I usually mix my own ""black"" by using dioxazine or burnt umber with whatever is in my palette which is normally limited to 3-4 colors. Ivory black worked well to desaturate and can mix to a nice cool grey.  If I had to distill the little things, it was scumbling all those different colors into the skin. Before I did this I liked certain parts and wanted to leave them that way but I kept thinking ""just let it go, you've already done this before"" so at first it seemed like I was destroying the painting. I also get hung up on trying not to make things look too vibrant because of old school painting theory but at the same time I feel like I'm not moving forward if I don't push past them.  Some detail shots of parts where this applied here. I feel that zoomed in they're vibrant and all but the effect is muted when viewed from a distance."
ArtistLounge,31l9qb,PolkaDotPeacock,2,Mon Apr 6 06:27:30 2015 UTC,That is interesting to see in the detail shots. The piece really does let the eye blend the colors in that pointillism method. But as opposed to actual pointillism I like the energy the scumbling adds to the surface.  And its hard to hit that point where you can just let yourself loosen up and roll with it! Our brains are always trying to control every step of the process.
ArtistLounge,31l9qb,PolkaDotPeacock,1 point,Mon Apr 6 18:22:33 2015 UTC,"That's where alcohol comes in handy :D When I use oils, the fumes are usually enough!"
ArtistLounge,31l9qb,keshiirue,2,Tue Apr 7 06:11:32 2015 UTC,hi!  I love to paint - but I've never really learned the words for the techniques used.  I'm very interested in this style - but can't seem to understand what scumbling means... can you point me in a direction?  Thanks!
ArtistLounge,31l9qb,_nouserforaname,2,Mon Apr 6 22:42:18 2015 UTC,Hi there! Scumbling is a way of combining small patches of color together to create a different color when from a distance. It relies more on human visual perception over hard and fast rules in popular color theory. (think about the white & gold / blue & black dress thing)  A good example and a favorite painter of mine is this piece. Claude Monet did this to the nth degree in the majority of his works but in this particular one it appears kind of pastel with colorful gradients but zoomed in you can see highly saturated colors scumbled together. Also Edgar Degas frequently used this technique as seen here There are more obvious bright reds and greens scumbled together in the flooring without overpowering the image. Greens are mixed in the skin tones to create color harmony as well. Hope this helps!

ArtistLounge,31ij65,litloo,3,Sun Apr 5 12:31:29 2015 UTC,"Bubbles and particles in the water help to add substance, also adding water/light effects (you know how when you see light bounce off water it makes that sort of criss cross light pattern?) on the skin and on the surface of the water if it's visible. Also light going though water tends to appear in pillars, sort of like when you see it go through smoke.  These are just some observations i've made.  Edit: oh! One more thing, you can make edges sort of blurry by using different colours distorting from each other to give the idea of light distortion under water. Think of it as adding in extra coours from the spectrum that have been split off as the light passes though the water. I've seen Yuumei do this."
ArtistLounge,31ij65,AGamerDraws,1 point,Sun Apr 5 13:33:19 2015 UTC,"i tried doing the underwater effects thing (the awkward yellow stuff) and i just didnt understand the pattern? but the pillar stuff i didnt know, thank you! i loove yuumei, on what painting is she doing the distortion thing? that sounds really fun, i have to try it next time! thank you :)"
ArtistLounge,31ij65,AGamerDraws,2,Sun Apr 5 14:39:22 2015 UTC,This one is the Yuumei painting. If you look at the fish and little edges on the hair you can see the sort of distortion effect she is doing. She's my favourite artist haha! =]
ArtistLounge,31ij65,m1rco,1 point,Sun Apr 5 15:45:28 2015 UTC,oh god i love that one! its so cool alright im gonna try it out! thanks again
ArtistLounge,31ij65,funisher,2,Sun Apr 5 16:25:00 2015 UTC,"I made this for RGD some time ago. The original foto was not underwater, so i just imagined how it looks underwater. In paitings like this it is much easier for me to stylise a lot and not go for a realistic paiting style. Also reference fotos help a lot. Have a look at some underwater shots of divers or animals helps to figure out how light and colors changes. Edit: this is the original rdg foto"
ArtistLounge,31ij65,funisher,2,Sun Apr 5 14:27:41 2015 UTC,whooaa that amazing!! :OOO i tried looking at reference photos but they all looked so different? i ended up using alot of them and i guess it just became a big mess although i guess i should study the photos and understand what is happening with the water thank you!! :)
ArtistLounge,31ij65,Dmunman,2,Sun Apr 5 14:36:50 2015 UTC,"/u/art-broken winged a nice water surface pattern to compromise a cropped forehead. When underwater the surfaces acts as a distorted window. But when you are outside the water it works more like a distorted mirror. Hence, it's not the water that's blue but the reflection of the blue sky. Obviously this all fluctuates with the transparency of the water itself. To hint that things are under water is all about making objects weightless. Hair becomes more silky and the strands separate. Fabrics billow like they are in a slow motion wind. And though surface patterns can reflect onto the object, that's not always the case. Take for instance this Portishead music video."
ArtistLounge,31ij65,Dmunman,2,Sun Apr 5 17:00:49 2015 UTC,holy shit that video fucked me up its amazing?! ive never thought about the surface being different depending on if you are over or under water thank you!

ArtistLounge,31fm7t,leo-g,3,Sat Apr 4 16:57:09 2015 UTC,"You should pursue them anyway. Every topic has profound ideas buried somewhere in there. I say go in with some loose ideas and start sketching. Don't over think it and psyche yourself out. Remember, art functions better asking the questions, not telling the answers. The fact that you're considering addressing them does verify that at the very least, they are real problems. The scale of the issue doesn't matter too much."
ArtistLounge,31fm7t,funisher,2,Sat Apr 4 17:04:59 2015 UTC,I think if the people can relate to the problem they are more likely inclined to talk about it and therefore create a stronger opinion of your art. That makes them like it either more or less. Had an exhibit about kids who were turned into adults too fast which resulted in very spirited arguments among the visitors. Which was a good thing. And also very exhausting.
ArtistLounge,31fm7t,Onomaya,3,Sat Apr 4 22:23:04 2015 UTC,"All art has pop culture references, even the most classic pieces, from Andy Warhol to Michelangelo. It's just, in some the time frame has gone by so the pop culture has become history, and even more has become lost in time. First world problems or not, art is art. Do what makes you happy and who cares what the world thinks of it or if it becomes dated. Comic book heroes were supposed to be dated and old, and they've lasted for ages now, for example. Don't let it hold you back from creating what you want."

ArtistLounge,319cfs,MeowskiesQQ,3,Fri Apr 3 04:50:14 2015 UTC,"That's a really cool tutorial, thank you! A question though: I've gotten a little bit too dependent on drawing directly from reference. But here you've used your references to create something new. Any suggestions on how to practice that?"
ArtistLounge,319cfs,DoktorKrokodil,5,Fri Apr 3 11:48:12 2015 UTC,"Hmm, well, I'd just go back to that main tenet: ""What do I like about this thing, and how am I going to show people how cool this thing is?"".   Once I have that in mind, I draw the subject directly out of my head, only glancing at the picture a few times to get the physical or anatomical details down.   I suppose it has more to do with drawing from imagination a lot! So to practice that in particular, I'd suggest you just draw what you love to draw, every day, even if it's only a little doodle! Doesn't matter what it is. Anime, fanart, comics of you and your friends, whatever. (I find gifts and little sketches for friends to be a great motivator to draw every day because I like making people happy!) You're building up your brain synapses.   Then practice will occur naturally, and you'll start building your ""artist vocabulary"" in your head to summon from. You'll intuitively know ""oh I drew a foot once in this position when drawing so and so comic, or I remember when I drew my friend's cat so now I know that cat's bodies curve like this, I can totally learn from my experience last time!""   Practice sketches are finite, you'll have to do a ton of them to get any good at art. So don't sweat over every little thing, just draw everyday and have fun doing it. I hope this helps at all! :D"

ArtistLounge,319c79,JFells,6,Fri Apr 3 01:02:05 2015 UTC,"Joseph, your work is pretty nice and I mean it in the actual sense of nice. Good skill good control of the mediums. And you ARE an illustrator as of now. In the greater sense, your work will always be considered illustration. No matter what medium you're using.  The question is what do you want to become? I just read your ""about"" section - yes 100% it shows in every aspect of your work that you have been trained as a true illustrator. And that's exactly what you're showing in your work. The way your objects are rendered is part of an illustrative look. Illustrations often don't have a real personality as compared to ""fine art work"". You now have a good foundation to go wherever you want to. Your mind is the only limit at this point. Your mind and the ability (which might take some years) to connect with your inner self in order to ""create"" something that is truly yours and only yours. That people will recognize instantly as to be yours.  I leave it at that for now - I can write much more on this and will if you'd like me to. But I think you feel alienated because you essentially do not want to be an illustrator but go beyond. AS of now you are an illustrator - which is still a pretty cool thing."

ArtistLounge,319c79,kaisengaard,1 point,Fri Apr 3 01:16:56 2015 UTC,"I think it's because I'm very varied with the work I make. I studied illustration and felt alienated from the faux naive cartoons, I feel like I'm missing some brain matter to vitally understand graphical composition and fine art carries implications of not being commercial, I suppose. I'm curious to know where you think I belong."

ArtistLounge,31735j,AGamerDraws,3,Thu Apr 2 14:47:04 2015 UTC,"""How do you find your style?""  My standard response being something along the lines of ""Well you just keep drawing and eventually it will come on it's own."" I feel this is still useful but a bit vague to tell another artist looking for direction. Still, it works for when I don't feel like going into details or I come across someone looking for some magic art pill.  Anyways, thanks for sharing this vid! It was neat to see him pick apart his own work and identifying what he finds appealing and how it influences his art. For your own eureka, you may have already seen this at some point but that S shape reminds me of this. This is a favorite theory I like to use as well from mark making to overall composition, it never fails and I hope you can really push it in your own work.  I like the new version. Even at this stage, I see less of the typical fashion runway / pretty girl + sword fantasy vibe and more into the actual characterization. Very different feels and I hope to see the finished version!"

ArtistLounge,31735j,blacklant,1 point,Thu Apr 2 21:32:52 2015 UTC,I feel like the figure on the left is much much more successful. It's not the messyness of your lines. The original figure you had just has a nicer gesture. The contrapposto of the figure on the left works much better and it's much more visually pleasing and stimulating. I personally think you overworked it. It was absolutely perfect before.
ArtistLounge,31735j,CuriosityK,1 point,Fri Apr 3 06:54:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your comment, but I feel like the things you like about the piece on the left are the exact things that make me dislike it.

ArtistLounge,317z3w,Spencypoo,5,Thu Apr 2 18:49:31 2015 UTC,"Ahhhh, the ol' price on the wall debate. A lot of it depends on the price points of the art and the venue. Obviously, working off a price list is ""classier"" to a certain degree but you won't have as many people considering buying if the idea of pricing never enters their minds. It depends how the viewer will be surprised. Will they be surprised by how affordable it is? Then put it on the wall. Will they go ""oh, that's a little pricey."" Then a price list might be good. I find that in high traffic environments its good to have all the information right there because they aren't gonna spend much time in each spot. Though I will be honest, I still dispute this topic with my friends regularly. :P  Now, as far as medium goes. If you are concerned about oil snobs you can always say mixed media if there is more than acrylic. Or list out all of the mediums. I don't think the stigma is as strong as it used to be and if the art is good it won't matter too much. Really there are things about acrylic you can use to your advantage. You can speak toward the durability and flexibility of the paint. The paintings will last longer,  they are much easier to clean, they won't crack, etc. Talk about how difficult the medium actually is. In many respects its harder to paint in acrylic than oil.  And I wouldn't worry about putting the dimensions in the tags. Have the info ready, but really all the tags need is the title, medium, and year it was made. And your name if it isn't present anywhere obviously. And really you could just print out two sets of tags, one with prices and one without. See what other people do and feel it out.  And don't forget to have fun. People love it when you are having fun! :D"
ArtistLounge,317z3w,funisher,2,Thu Apr 2 20:02:18 2015 UTC,Ah the two versions of tags is a great idea! I use little chalk board cards and write the prices/titles on there with chalk pen. That way I can rub them out if I feel they aren't necessary for the event. But obviously that adds a sort of rustic/cafe feel that may not apply to this type of event.
ArtistLounge,317z3w,AGamerDraws,1 point,Thu Apr 2 20:06:19 2015 UTC,Awesome advice.  Thanks for taking the time to write all that out. Never thought about touting the virtues of acrylic.  I think you're right about the shock factor in the pricing too.

ArtistLounge,3174ge,k0nundrum,3,Thu Apr 2 22:56:27 2015 UTC,"I did; basically just did a normal graphite portrait with shading, then brushed it (carefully) with water, starting with the highlights. I'm not sure what to do about areas of detail, like eyes, since they turned into a bit of a muddy mess even with a little water. Probably using a smaller brush, but I'm lazy and would have had to get up and get one instead of using what was already in my hand. ;)  Edit: I also would pay closer attention to pencil strokes than I did.

ArtistLounge,312o5z,CuriosityK,2,Thu Apr 2 03:06:14 2015 UTC,"Maybe your thought form right now really is sandwiches and dogs wearing sunglasses? But redone for your more mature mind? Instead of kitchy childhood dreams of pugs wearing oversized glasses riding motorcycles and fighting space sandwiches (what is it with you and the fucking sandwiches!? from Bad Santa) your mindscape wants to have great danes fighting dirty, blood splatter, glasses, and alien sandwiches from Mars. Something serious, and detailed and mature. I dunno.  What I'm saying is just because you've visited it once, doesn't mean it doesn't warrant a second chance. Sometimes the best work is done by rehashing it. Authors go over books a million times, after all. It may be a theme for you, your devil in the details, your muse. Who knows?  Either way, try something new. What mediums haven't you tried yet? Watercolor? Oils? Finger paints? Sculpture? Throw down something truly ugly and make it beautiful with art. Write about your most passionate moment, then draw it as abstractly as possible. Draw your enemy as gently as possible with the the colors you hate the most. Brew a pot of strong tea with a dozen teabags and pretend it's the blood of your first love, and paint your break up letter. Think of moments in time that already exist and come up with new and creative ways to make them a reality on paper. Who cares if it turns out looking good. Pollock threw what is essentially garbage on a huge canvas and we all consider him a visionary. You don't need school, you need to go inward, then outward.   Oooooor, you could do what I do, which is browse /r/aww until I find a super cute animal and needle felt it. (or draw it, in your case.) Always works for me!"

Not that recognition is what RGD is about, of course, I'm just happy with it and wanted to share!"
ArtistLounge,30z2mp,headcrab1991,2,Tue Mar 31 21:25:10 2015 UTC,"I think with a lot of artists, whether it be traditional paint/drawing, dance, music or whatever it is inspired by a need to be creative and a desire to do it full time. The money isn't necessarily a morivating factor at the time.   Then at some point whether you are doing it full time or as a side hobby making money becomes more important. You have to pay bills and put food on your table as well as cover your expenses. This doesn't mean you have sold out or anything. You simply are doing what you need to do to make a living or be compensated for your art.   Personally, I'm an amateur who takes commissions where I can (generally from people on reddit), I have a full time job and in my spare time I paint and draw what I feel I need to. But when a commission comes you have to make the client happy. This may mean they want to see a boring, simple image or that they want your creativity and give you carte Blanche with the work. Myself, I went to design school and did small work and truly hated having to appease the crowd or client. Artistically it was unfulfilling. However today with sites like etsy, redbubble and even reddit you can make your work and people have access to purchase it if they like it. It creates a balance between working for a paycheck from a client and expressing yourself artistically  Now this all isnt to say that there aren't artists out there who are taking advantage of great publicity and being involved in the right circles because there certainly are i feel Andy Warhol, Banksy and Michael Godard easily fall into this category but even they became artists out of a desire to express creativity."
ArtistLounge,30z2mp,TheRealKozi,1 point,Wed Apr 1 02:37:52 2015 UTC,"Huh, I guess you are right about a lot of these sites being a kind of middle way between appeasing to an audience and doing your own stuff. Haven't thought of that.   I guess needing money to live is just part of reality and at some point I need to let go of some ideals. Facing the facts, and so on.   Like you said, there are some people who to take advantage but if I were to hit a big break with something and people would demand to just see more of it (and pay for it) I'd probably just continue doing it and playing it safe. Thanks for your answer!"
ArtistLounge,30z2mp,AGamerDraws,2,Thu Apr 2 18:45:46 2015 UTC,"I really enjoy commercial stuff, because it gives the art purpose. I want to tell stories and spread my art around so selling graphic novels and prints is really the perfect version of that. It also means I meet lots of people who love and support my work, which is the best part of my job.  I used to make mostly IP inspired artwork and I loved every second of it. My Final Fantasy inspired series being my favourite. Unfortunatly this is something that I am going to have to move to just being portfolio pieces rather than for sale due to the rules where I sold it changing. I find this disheartening when I know artists like Olly Moss and Sakimichan or places like GameTee can sell it all just fine, but oh well, rules are rules. Instead I am working on a completely new collection of art prints with fully original characters and worlds. It's scary because it's new territory and I have no idea what kind of things will sell, but i'm excited because all of a sudden I have a lot of freedom again even though it's still commercial.  As for finding out what sold, I would just make it all, have it for sale and let the market force show me. I've had magnets, shirts, key rings, prints and books. I discovered interesting things for example: People always asked me to make t-shirts of my art, but once I had them for sale no one would buy them. Then random artwork that I made quickly at like 3am, but had a lot of emotion in it would sell really well, so I realised it was story and feeling that grabbed people's attention. So it was just trial and error.  But to answer the original question, I love making commercial work. I love coming up with packaging, branding, and designing the product. I love finding out how to make it look best on the convention floors and seeing people's faces when they buy it. It's great fun, and motivates me a lot more than my personal art for art sakes work. I guess I just like making art for other people."
ArtistLounge,30z2mp,AGamerDraws,1 point,Wed Apr 1 11:48:25 2015 UTC,"Very interesting that you enjoy it so much, but kind of logical as it seems to fit into what you want to do anyway.  I think it's very cool that you are being challenged to try new things. I find it very hard to step outside my comfort zone but staying too long in your own warmed up puddle gets uncomfortable in it's own way.  I've actually not yet tried to open a shop myself. I think not working digitally at all is a pretty big hinderance in this regard.  The T-shirt thing is funny but pretty typical I guess. People can be very vocal about things and then very shy to back their claims up with money, just to go and buy a brand product where half the price is the brand, without even thinking about it. But heck, I do that myself from time to time.  I guess seeing it more like giving something back to people is a lot more motivating than ""I'm trying to earn money here"". That's a great attitude!"
ArtistLounge,30xsgg,Dmunman,3,Tue Mar 31 16:01:54 2015 UTC,I threw away or gave away every piece of art I had before I hit a certain level of happiness with my work where I actually want to show it to people. I took pictures of stuff that was interesting and saved them in a folder on my external hard drive. Partly for nostalgic reasons and partly for inspiration but honestly I never go look at that shit. Now stuff is coming out that I really like or I did something meaningful with; it's easy to keep around.

ArtistLounge,30xsgg,LilaSunflower,2,Tue Mar 31 22:21:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah canvas is so expensive. Maybe you can get good pictures of them and then reuse after you're ready to let them go. I think another key to letting go is continuing to improve as an artist. Once stuff starts coming out of you that's 100x better it's so easy to get rid of the old stuff. I started feeling like 'oh god I hope no one I know saw that,' when it used to be one of my best things. lol."
ArtistLounge,30xsgg,LilaSunflower,1 point,Wed Apr 1 00:09:27 2015 UTC,"Another note, I usually go get rid of a bunch of old work after I make some huge jump forward in my process. I usually hold onto stuff for about two growth cycles. Then it feels so old I can't even look at it. I'm still improving a lot though. I have a feeling it'll be different now that I'm feeling more comfortable drawing. I am just starting to feel like 'oh yeah that is what I wanted to do' rather than 'meh, it takes a long time, good practice run.' I think I'll keep some of these new ones a lot longer but who knows."

Without seeing the reference, I would make the hair above the ear just a touch darker, just to give it a bit of contrast and give it a bit of volume and dimension. And pull out some highlights with a kneaded eraser for his hair on the front. You might also want to make the highlight on the right side of his face and shoulder a touch brighter.

I love how the blending brings out the texture of the paper in the background, while the delicate shading of the face is smooth. Actually, I think you've handled the hair in this portrait appropriately, as very young children often have fine, wispy hair. I think your treatment looks very natural.   It looks like you used an eraser to create some highlights in the hair, but, if the source photo had more distinct shininess maybe use your kneaded eraser a bit more boldly to bring out the highlights. Those highlights will appear brighter if you lay down slightly deeper shading, too."

ArtistLounge,30uzv5,Varo,3,Tue Mar 31 20:50:19 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, yes. And so have some of the coolest books and music. The hard part is having the discipline to sit down to create the work while awake. Having a creative idea or a cool dream is human, actually executing it is art. People struggle with deciding what part of the idea is important. Few are good at sorting the nonsense from a dream. Even less people are willing to put the time in and learn to create with skill. The skill, time, and effort is whats valuable. The world is full of idea people, it lacks people willing to execute their dreams.   That first paragraph is a bit poetic. The truth of it is his drawings are boring. High school level sketches of Marilyn Monroe and The Ring type scrawlings do nothing for me. If his creations were even a tad more interesting I'd admire the guy for both being able to draw and think of a good gimmick to sell his drawings. As it is, he's just a circus act."

ArtistLounge,30s05q,ObeyMyBrain,1 point,Mon Mar 30 18:24:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah it really seems more like a chicken-and-egg scenario.  You need a fan base to support you, but you probably need the support to help create art to get a fan base.  Someone who already has a great fan base and tons of art would likely have an easy time of getting patreon funding.  It's like the old banker's adage.  If you need money, we won't give you any.  If you don't need money, you can have as much as you want."

I saw one clever girl on Twitch the other day (viking_lass) who interlinked her two favorite activities with one another. She offered Twitch aboneers (?!) her sketches as reward and her sketches, of course, often were often gaming-themed. She had quite a few patrons already. I think you would need an appealing concept for patreon first (like an exciting storyline of a graphic novel and a few examples of your art-style) and then advertise it every way you can.

ArtistLounge,30pgyu,kaisengaard,5,Wed Apr 1 12:56:19 2015 UTC,"What does it need more of?  Less of?   I don't really care what the topic or cause is, I just want more participation.  I see a lot of (good) posts that just sit at 2 or 3 comments.  Obviously how to get more involvement is the question.   How do you feel about the weekly features? Graveyard & Showcase Sunday   I like the graveyard in spirit, despite not having much time to participate myself.  I think it's always nice to have that out there as a way to try and give people who didn't get anything a sort of second chance.  To be honest I'm not a huge fan of the Showcase please don't pitchfork me.  I'll give you my (usually long-winded) perspective to explain.  When I pop in here, I'm looking for cool discussions and questions.  I like the idea of a showcase, but when I see the post all I think of is ""okay, this would require some work from me to participate.""  By that I mean I'd have to sit and think for a while about any particular artists I like or have seen lately (I don't always pay attention to artists' names when I'm browsing art or actually save the pictures), then I'd have to create a comment with the artist's name, link to their works, and a general description of either their style or an analysis of a particular piece.  Add into that I kind of feel like people might be ""judging"" my choice as a reflection of me.  Obviously I know you guys really wouldn't judge me or give a poop, but the thought is still there.  Typically I'll see a couple people post stuff from some awesome, classical genius, so I wouldn't want to follow up with ""HEY CHECK OUT THIS SPONGEBOB FANART I FOUND.""  I still feel like this sub struggles with getting a critical mass of participation.  Just glancing at the first page sorted by hot, I see that roughly half the posts have zero comments.  To me it seems like even if posts were exactly what people wanted to see, there's still the problem of getting people to actually participate.  I think a possible tactic would be to take the same gusto you folks seem to have in recruiting participants in RGD and apply that to this sub.  ""Hey, come draw some cool stuff in RGD!  Oh and by the way, we have a cool discussion sister-sub where you can talk to other artists and such.""  ::steps off soap box::  Sorry, I don't really know how to change things the way I'd like to see them changed :/"
ArtistLounge,30pgyu,Dmunman,2,Mon Mar 30 19:05:11 2015 UTC,I like showcase. Youve shown me stuff ive ne ver seen. I think it would be a cool thing to have vidieo chat thing. I understand that up to twelve people could be on at one time. Maybe a chat live with you mods. I bet you could write a book. Possibly your best of pics disscused live.
ArtistLounge,30pgyu,funisher,2,Mon Mar 30 10:49:30 2015 UTC,"Also, I would like to add that I wouldn't mind seeing more discussion and question threads. I feel like that's where this sub really thrives. I'll have to throw some in myself."

ArtistLounge,30pgyu,Brassawiking,1 point,Wed Apr 1 00:27:52 2015 UTC,"As people mentioned already, participation and engagement is what unfortunately is lacking for Artist Lounge. Mainly because everyone here tend to be a showcaser, having something to show. But if everybody is here just to show off their stuff, you tend to stick to your own post and wait for response.  I myself feel kinda bad about posting work I've done occasionaly, as it just feels spammy and ""oh look at me, look at me!"". Then it turns instead to more of a guilt driven duty to atleast comment the other ongoing posts if you self are posting something.   So the problem might lie within roles and expectations. I made once a thread where I said that I would offer anyone CC as best I could, which seemed to be much healthy, as there was a clear expectation of the level of engagement for the thread. If someone commented in it -> I get a message for it and will respond with CC.   So maybe a clearer system of people who offer to give CC, tips, help, etc. would help out? In a sort of buyer/seller arrangement."
ArtistLounge,30pgyu,funisher,1 point,Thu Apr 2 12:51:33 2015 UTC,"We used to have weekly music thread on Sunday and the Theme of the Week on Wednesday but they went the way of the Showcase Sunday thread as well. Eventually only one or two people were participating. My theory with the Theme of the Week was that it went from feeling motivating to obligatory. I'm curious if the Showcase Sunday thread went the same way, which would be a bummer because its important for artists to reach out. Its natural for artists to fall into their private routines but I get a little sad when we all back step from being a community. I like it when we are all homies, just chillin with each other in our special sub. :)  Oh, also, if anyone has any questions, ideas, or requests regarding the Artist Lounge Podcast /u/AGamerDraws and I would be more than happy to hear them!"

It can get tricky lining up guests because they need stable internet, possibly a usb webcam, a microphone, and a computer that can run a live chat for over 3 hours without lagging. Fortunately, we still manage to find people. :) I've been playing around with some options with my rig to see if I can bring in some local guest artists too."

I know the Theme of the Week thread could feel like homework but Showcase Sunday wasn't any more complicated than just mentioning some art you've been checking out. So I'm not sure why participation dwindled. Maybe it just comes and goes in waves. Does it work better as a thread that pops up randomly?

ArtistLounge,30lmda,leeloogetsdrawn,5,Sat Mar 28 14:17:51 2015 UTC,"Hi,  I have worked from photographs when doing figure drawing / painting, and I find that the best photos share several qualities:   Full figure is in the shot Limited/ more dramatic lighting (to create interesting shadow patterns) Many of the photos you can find online in a Google search are lit with tons of fill to the point where there are virtually no shadows on the figure. Good exsposure, so if there is a clearly defined area of light and a clearly defined area in shadow, you can still make out the figure clearly and not have areas in shadow be lost into the background. Using a solid background which has a value that contrasts with that of the figure should help. Limit lens distortions as much as possible, so no wide lenses close to the model. And no narrow lens shots with deep foreshortening.   Your overall goal is to take photographs that look as natural as possible, and as much like they would if you were standing in the room drawing the model live."
ArtistLounge,30lmda,OmNomChompskey,5,Sat Mar 28 14:46:26 2015 UTC,"All good points! A couple of other things:   Along with the full figure, think about the gesture and positioning of your hands and feet. Elegantly posed hands can make all of the difference in a finished piece. Weight shift! Compression vs. stretch on the torso, tilted hips and anything the creates contrast in the contour of the figure is desirable.   Thanks for your submissions! There is nothing I like more than drawing the human figure."
ArtistLounge,30lmda,dead_painter,2,Sat Mar 28 16:50:00 2015 UTC,This is great. Thank you.
ArtistLounge,30lmda,claireballoon,3,Sat Mar 28 15:40:01 2015 UTC,The only thing I can think to add to what has previously been said is color. Just simple purple curtains in the room make the light on the model completely different. You get some great results by having color in there!
ArtistLounge,30lmda,somnivision,2,Sat Mar 28 15:27:23 2015 UTC,I'll try to get creative with color! Some of the artists inject their own crazy color schemes and it's incredible. My favorite one was deleted by the artist unfortunately but I'll try to mess around with color!
ArtistLounge,30lmda,k0nundrum,2,Sat Mar 28 15:41:03 2015 UTC,"Most of what I look for has already been addressed. We don't all have lighting gear to work with so lighting isn't so important for me. As long as the photo isn't too dark and parts aren't all in silhouette, it's enough to work from.  If possible, try to shoot with a 50mm lens in 35mm equivalent. This is the closest to how human eyes perceive the world and any foreshortening is minimized. Also, try to control this in your pose by not pointing limbs directly at the lens. These may make for interesting photos but are not particularly useful for general drawing practice.  The photos you posted were fine in terms of content, lighting is ok but most of them are cut off. (For privacy reasons, I'd rather see a blurred out face vs. cropping out but I'm not sure if those are allowed in rgd) As long as you're not depicting actual sex, feel free to push the boundaries. If you ruffle a few conservative feathers in the process, welcome to the arts lol."

ArtistLounge,30lmda,YoungArtist,2,Sun Mar 29 17:36:35 2015 UTC,"I agree about whole figure, and good lighting. Personally, I would prefer more natural and less sexual, given that I'd love to practice figure drawing but have kids who like to look through my sketchbooks. I'm fine with them seeing nudity, but I would skip a ""sexy pose"" for their sakes.  But I'm just one person. :)  Thank you for being brave and willing to share yourself in such a vulnerable way. I'm glad to hear that it helps with confidence. That's awesome!   One more thing... as a fellow woman, I personally would recommend against sharing your face in a nude, since the Internet can be horrible, and once photos on imgur, they're out of your control."
ArtistLounge,30juqg,sunstep,6,Sat Mar 28 00:11:17 2015 UTC,One thing that a program like Manga Studio and a few others are able to do better than photoshop is to automatically smooth your lines out as you draw. Here's a demonstration of stabilization.

ArtistLounge,30juqg,DeathStarDriveBy,3,Sat Mar 28 07:28:26 2015 UTC,"Wacoms take some getting used to for sure. Keep in mind you can adjust your sensitivity settings. Personally, I'm constantly zooming in after a rough sketch because I tend to draw cleaner with bigger gestures. Depending on the piece, I often sketch and ink on regular paper, scan it in, and add color and finishing effects in Photoshop. If you have a white background, import your sketch layer and set to multiply mode, tweak your levels, and paint on the layers beneath it, it can be pretty fluid. Also, since I suck with color, it's a lot less stressful since I don't have to worry about ruining a drawing with shitty coloring."
ArtistLounge,30juqg,metabaron,1 point,Sat Mar 28 01:27:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I'll mess around with my settings, but do you know of any tablets that might be easier to maintain control if not Wacom?   I'm always zooming in as well, but it sometimes ends up looking kind of choppy when I narrow it down in sections like that. It's a lot of erasing and redrawing for me all the time.   I have found it easier to do line work on paper and color it digitally. I'll try out your way of doing it! In the end it might be easier for me to just stick with doing the lines on paper when I do feel like practicing digital art. (I do want to get better at controlling my pen digitally regardless though!)"
ArtistLounge,30juqg,the-tinidril,3,Sat Mar 28 02:11:45 2015 UTC,Never used it myself but the lazynezumi PhotoShop plugin gets a lot of good reviews from users if you don't want to switch programs.   It's not free ($20 for students) but there's a 30 day trial.
ArtistLounge,30juqg,ObeyMyBrain,2,Sat Mar 28 17:01:35 2015 UTC,Oh damn. This isn't the first time I've cursed my decision to go with Mac haha. Thank you for the suggestion though!
ArtistLounge,30juqg,sucroussette,2,Sat Mar 28 18:31:59 2015 UTC,"I was just given an upgrade on my Wacom tablet, I'm now using Intuos Pro size large. I like the large drawing area because I tend to use sweeping arm movements to sketch, and also because I'm getting older and arthritis makes gripping the pen to make controlled hand movements causes cramps. The Pro level doubles the number of levels of pressure sensitivity.  As for programs you should use less expensive and more natural-media ones than Photoshop. I use ArtRage 4 (also available through Steam) and it has an ink pen tool with automatic (and completely adjustable) ""smoothing"" which gets rid of shakiness in the lines. I find that the more pressure and control I try to exert over my hand movements now, the shakier the line gets... kind of like Charles Shultz' later work. Smoothing, even really low settings, takes all that out.   ArtRage also has other natural media tools that create beautifully authentic looking oil painting, watercolor, pencil, ink, and more.  Edit: fixed link"
ArtistLounge,30juqg,CommanderRocket,1 point,Sat Mar 28 09:37:29 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I'll look into it when my current tablet fails me. It sounds a lot nicer and within a reasonable price too.   I only really have free access to Photoshop for as long as I'm a student, so this is perfect time for me to try out new art programs. From the sound of it, there are a lot more intuitive and more afforable ones out there. I'll try out ArtRage 4, thanks! The natural media tools sound especially like what I need for coloring too."
ArtistLounge,30juqg,megaswan,2,Sat Mar 28 18:15:48 2015 UTC,You can also look into older model intuos 3 or 4s on ebay for a lot cheaper than the newest versions.

ArtistLounge,30juqg,megaswan,2,Sat Mar 28 02:37:38 2015 UTC,"There may be a tiny bit of lag. I have an older Wacom tablet and the lag is definitely noticeable. I deal with it in two ways.  1) Zoom in and be patient. The larger your gesture, the better job your technology will do in reproducing it.  2) Tape a piece of paper to your tablet and use that as your drawing surface. The friction from the paper will slow down your stroke, significantly increasing the fidelity of the line on the screen."
ArtistLounge,30juqg,megaswan,1 point,Sat Mar 28 03:58:35 2015 UTC,"I do have to deal with noticeable lag sometimes, but I've always figured it had to do with my laptop running too many programs since it comes and goes. I'll try out your way! Thanks!"
ArtistLounge,30juqg,jackjohnbrown,2,Sat Mar 28 03:17:31 2015 UTC,"I can't draw a smooth line in Photoshop to save my life, which is why I would only use it for image processing, not drawing.

ArtistLounge,30joch,brittneyok,2,Fri Mar 27 23:14:30 2015 UTC,"If its a consignment the standard is 50%. This can vary depending on the reputation of the gallery or the terms of the representation. A smaller DIY gallery may only take 30% or so depending on the setup of the business. But 50% is standard for a gallery that represents an artist under contract and holds a steady client base.  Edit: I should also mention that some galleries purchase artwork and resell it, and there are many dealers that work privately that do the same. They can mark up art like crazy. The art market is very unregulated. It's nuts."

ArtistLounge,30h4tz,Dmunman,2,Fri Mar 27 10:49:41 2015 UTC,"If you really can't go with it (which is a hard thing to do for perfectionists ) I'd say it might be best if you applied just another gesso layer with the same brush you did the underlying painting with. That will give you extra structure and hide the thing you did before better. The surface will still be very uneven (obviously) but it will look as if you had intended it all along. I know at least one good artist who does it on purpose to make his (oil)paintings more interesting. An interesting sitenote perhaps: There is a genre in art that is called ""Panart"". Pan-Artists always draw their pictures over more or less elaborate underpaintings. The difference to a classical layering approach is that the underpainting is a completely different painting than the one above. It's not there for technical reasons (like sketching, shading, ...) but for the final atmosphere, the vibe, the painting is going to have. Pan Artists usually work with special Pan Art colors that are a mix of acrylic and oil paints."
ArtistLounge,30h4tz,Onomaya,1 point,Fri Mar 27 19:21:47 2015 UTC,"It now looks like I have hidden satanic messages in my painting   Personally I'd probably pay extra for that...

ArtistLounge,30h4tz,kaisengaard,2,Fri Mar 27 18:55:55 2015 UTC,"I considered leaving it just to potentially freak people out.   Its obvious enough that when I sent a picture of the painting to my friend they pointed it out. However, it has gotten better after painting over the area a few times and adding color variation.   I honestly probably have a painting that looks similar to that lying around somewhere."
ArtistLounge,30h4tz,somnivision,0,Fri Mar 27 19:10:04 2015 UTC,Sanding is a bad idea for painted surfaces as the dust can be quite toxic due to the pigments in the paint. Yes even if you have amazing ventilation and a mask it's not worth the risk & effort vs. buying a new canvas.  I would rather work with heavy impasto / knife painting instead of trying to even out the surface. There are some diy mediums you can make to extend paints to create texture without wasting all your paint. I can post more details on these if you're interested.
ArtistLounge,30h4tz,somnivision,2,Fri Mar 27 15:13:15 2015 UTC,"I'm cursing all of the people/websites that have told me to do that in the past.    Please do! I know that you can go purchase gel mediums to add to paints to help, but i've not heard of any diy mediums."
ArtistLounge,30h4tz,Onomaya,3,Fri Mar 27 19:11:34 2015 UTC,"It's not an exact science but here's what I use for acrylics:   plaster a paris or pre-mixed DAP - yes the stuff you use to fill in cracks in walls (I use the powdered form) Available at any hardware store for dirt cheap. PVA - regular white glue. Common binder in acrylic paints. This will add some flex to the mixture so it won't crack especially if working on a canvas. add water depending on consistency   You can add other acrylic mediums to it like soft gel so it has a consistent finish - highly recommend doing this as it will dry matte. Like with most mediums this will slightly desaturate them depending on the ratio you use. Store it in an airtight container and give it a good mix before you use it. Works great for knife painting.  The oil paint version is basically: Plaster a Paris + linseed/walnut oil depending on what you like to use.   It's much more ""runny"" than the acrylic version but this will extend your paint even more so and give you some nice texture. The recipe can get pretty complex but I just use the basic version with good results: http://www.tadspurgeon.com/puttytutorial.php   Hope this helps!"
ArtistLounge,30h4tz,somnivision,2,Sat Mar 28 01:27:42 2015 UTC,Please post the details! I heard that most of those impasto thingies are overprized anyway and can be mixed with simple ingredients you get at any hardware store.

ArtistLounge,30dicy,vholecek,4,Thu Mar 26 14:26:38 2015 UTC,"Oils take a LOT longer to dry, unless you're using the gesso (?) stuff (it's been forever, someone should correct me, it's that clear stuff that looks like snot). Even then, it still takes a longer to dry than acrylics. This is very good... and very bad. Acrylics, you do something, you wait a bit, come back, you paint over it.   Oils...? Notsomuch, no. It'll still be wet. Which means you have to be more careful where you put colors, especially ones that mush into colors you don't like, mix with colors next to them strange, or other such nonsense that oils like to do. You gotta take care where you put stuff and be less fidgety. No messing endlessly with a spot you don't like, it'll become an oily, soggy mess and look like crap for months till the oil dries and you can paint over it properly again.  BUT! The wetness is good, too! Because you can make big swipes and wooshies and the paints come out clean and crisp! You can do a bit, then come back tomorrow and it'll still be mostly wet! You can create layers of paint and gently peel them apart because they'll be still as they were the day before! The paint feels like it's alive more, because it doesn't die quickly on the canvas like acrylics. Oils feel living, in a way.  Acrylics are like mayflies. They live vibrantly, making loud sounds and cracking and crying and darting around happily for a day, but then they're dead and you can shuffle them around on the floor and ooh and aaah at how pretty they look, and they are gorgeous and nice.... but oils are like dragonflies. They live longer, but they're delicate, and easily squished into nasty icky messes. You see a lot of the messes, and not a lot of the actual dragonflies, but once you see them, you love them, because they are so etherial. Delicate, lovely, and sometimes squished messes. That's oil painting.  Yep.  Someone else can probably explain it better. It's been a good few years since I've worked with oils. Loved them, though."
ArtistLounge,30dicy,CuriosityK,3,Thu Mar 26 16:24:00 2015 UTC,"I use oils!  I think you've given a very lovely description of I use them!  The snot-like substance is an alkyd medium.  I use Liquin, but there are many good brands. Using the ""fat over lean"" principles, the top layers end up drying faster, as you use more of the alkyd.  For glazing, you may be better off using a fine detail alkyd medium, as I know the original liquin formulation can dry a bit too quickly to really play with on big pieces."
ArtistLounge,30dicy,AcceptThisUsername,3,Thu Mar 26 17:44:43 2015 UTC,"I really only did little pieces, I did oils in college when I was skipping out on my physics classes and taking art ones instead. We only had one kind of snot liquid. I went through a couple bottles of the stuff, mostly cuz I kept using it like glue to stick stuff to my canvas and cuz I was completely impatient. I wasn't terribly good with oils till I stopped fussing with them. I'm not good at planning any of my artwork out in advance, and oils kinda need a little of that, so some of my work was hideous. Anything I could do abstract-ish and just not worry about being perfect was super fun, though.  I do watercolors now. The speed they dry is much better (for the cats, mostly. 7 cats + oil painting = BAD IDEA) and I funk around with colors, though I hate the planning parts of watercolors, so I'm not great at them.   I still have my ancient and probably rotten tubes of oil paints. Can't bear to part with them, even if they're probably like... disgusting..."
ArtistLounge,30dicy,CuriosityK,2,Thu Mar 26 20:59:42 2015 UTC,I'm in the same boat as you!
ArtistLounge,30dicy,CatInAVan,2,Thu Mar 26 15:02:14 2015 UTC,Get ready to never use acrylics again.
ArtistLounge,30dicy,MB_art,2,Thu Mar 26 23:59:42 2015 UTC,"I started with acrylics and dip into oils every now and then. Here's what I learned so far:  linseed oil or walnut oil can be used to thin paints but can extend drying time. They are also great for cleaning brushes - let them soak in a jar of this stuff to loosen paint or you can use a small amount to store ""wet"" brushes in a tray.   For regular brush cleaning, forget the overpriced art store stuff as dish soap works quite well. The degreasing in it removes oils easily without damaging the bristles.   turpentine vs. odorless solvent. Unless you are overly sensitive, choose the smelly kind. Both are harmful either way but at least you'll know if there's any on your hands or why you're so damn high after painting. Yep, ventilation is pretty important.  For a quick drying underpainting, you can use watered down acrylic or oil paint with lots of turp. Use rags to scrub the canvas with paint vs. brushing it to speed things up during this stage.  Main difference between the two is that it's much easier to blend using oils without having to use extra mediums and such and of course the drying time. I've heard nothing but bad things about accelerants like cobalt drier (causes cancer) so I just wait in frustration or work on another piece in the meantime."
ArtistLounge,30dicy,somnivision,1 point,Fri Mar 27 01:03:58 2015 UTC,"They are smelly. Gotta use thinners to clean. Take forever to dry,if you need to paint over something itll be at least a week before you can. They are smelly."
ArtistLounge,30dicy,Dmunman,2,Thu Mar 26 17:42:48 2015 UTC,"Oil paints themselves are not smelly, unless you are SUPER sensitive. Solvents and mediums are what can be smelly, depends which ones you use."
ArtistLounge,30dicy,bigAlittleA,2,Thu Mar 26 19:29:59 2015 UTC,My wife complained about how bad they smelled. To the point i switched to acrylics. Hard to use oils without the thinners.
ArtistLounge,30dicy,Dmunman,2,Fri Mar 27 00:00:42 2015 UTC,"Not impossible. You don't need to add turps to the paint, and there are odorless for cleaning brushes. I have been painting with oil paints for over 20 years."
ArtistLounge,30dicy,bigAlittleA,2,Fri Mar 27 01:55:22 2015 UTC,40 years here..just to smelly for my wife. Never bothered me because i cant smell anything.(broken sniffer). Was just trying to honest as possible for the question. I still think oils are the best.
ArtistLounge,30dicy,Dmunman,1 point,Fri Mar 27 10:46:36 2015 UTC,"are thinners something that are kind of a requisite with oils?  I remember someone mentioning before something about linseed oil or mineral spirits in the past, but I wasn't paying attention at the time because I never foresaw myself working with oils..."
ArtistLounge,30dicy,Dmunman,2,Fri Mar 27 00:27:38 2015 UTC,"Dont get me wrong, they are my favorite medium. But to wask the oils and pigments from your brushes you need oil solvents. Oils are basicaly a kind of oil like linseed or other oils that have pigments finely groind to dust and mixed in. To thin or clean, you gotta have these smelly thinners drying on your brushes. Some folks only paint outdoors in summer for this reason. read cleanup on labels. Hope this helps. There are some very great makers of oil paints. Slow and steady is that race. Think months and years for a painting. Acrlyics if you want speed"

ArtistLounge,30a258,PM_ME_UR_BOOMBOOMS,12,Wed Mar 25 18:21:00 2015 UTC,"This is a touchy subject because they could just cut-and-run to the next designer willing to work for pennies on the dollar and you could ""miss out"". But that said:  You should have a contract with them regarding how many imprints can be made with your design for the $80 mentioned. Never give them unlimited access to sell your art.   or  You should have a contract for a royalty fee per shirt sold. Depending on how successful or unsuccessful your designs are, either may be the smart approach.   If you are willing to self promote and the site is a ""big name"" then the second option might be up your alley. If you just want to make a little money off of a design and you feel the price is fair, go with the first.   Like I said, there may not be room for negotiation, but you can always try. They might have a standard contract. Whatever you do, just be sure that there is language in the contract that you retain exclusive rights to your work and can reproduce it and manipulate it yourself, however you see fit."

ArtistLounge,3068i5,JetDog,3,Tue Mar 24 22:02:51 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping to DM a campaign. Still working out the logisitics, also I'm not super experienced (even as a player) so I'll have a lot of reading and researching to do.  Anyway, here's the story:  Long ago, the kingdom of Umbria sought to spread its seeds and destroy all other life in Amalur. Umbria's air is populated with sharp, crystalline spores that spread its silicon-based fungal life and kill off the carbon-based biology we know as our own. The inhabitants of Umbria view our biology as profane and imperfect compared to the fractal flora and fauna that populate its landscape.  In spite of its possession of overwhelmingly powerful magic and ability to manipulate space and matter, Umbria was driven back and quarantined in the northwest corner of Amalur. The kingdom lays dormant behind the Perihelion Mountains, which act as a natural barrier for the spores that would otherwise take root and poison the mainland.  The rest of the world now exists in an uneasy peace. The bulk of humanity resides in Avonmora. Man is a young, seafaring species and they guard the seas from The Eventide, which is the poisonous and sharp black algae that is native to Umbria. They are closely allied with the elves of Decidua.  Decidua is the vanguard against a first Umbrian invasion. It is said that some of its inhabitants have defiled themselves with the sands of The Ebb (the purple border between Decidua and Umbria) in the pursuit of attaining powerful magic, but most people dismiss this as rumor, as the sands are highly toxic.  Zephyria is a land home to the Zephyrians, who aren't a race as much as a nomadic collective comprised of elements of every race in Amalur. They are the only nation in Amalur to possess air travel, and the population is almost solely airborne. The land in central Zephyria is comprised of a giant grassy plain, and its forests and mountains were long ago gutted of their resources. As a result of this, Zephyria's citizens thrive largely through trade via airship. They are a neutral nation and serve as a middle man to nations whose relations would otherwise be strained.  No one is sure how Zephyrian airships stay afloat. It is a jealously guarded secret and anyone accepted into Zephyrian society is bound with a spell that, upon beginning to divulge this secret, puts a person into a waking comatose state where they are paralyzed and unable to speak but are aware of their surroundings. Rumors say that the Zephyrians might be utilizing Umbrian technologies (Umbria is said to have possessed the secrets of flight), but as Zephyrian society is highly secretive, no one can say.  Ferrinoth and Firmanoth were once a single dwarven kingdom. Ferrin dwarves are master blacksmiths, while Firman dwarves are masters of earthware weaponry and armor. The kingdom was divided when the Ferrin dwarves opened trade with the orcs, goblins, and other dark creatures that reside in the volcanic kingdom of Obsidia. The Ferrin dwarves did so because the fires of Obsidia forge much stronger steel, but this forging process has a poisoning effect and the air and land. Being strongly tied to the earth and its health, the Firman dwarves severed relations with Ferrinoth and swore off Ferrin steel.  The Firman dwarves now hone their crafting skills on ceramic armor and blades, which are lighter and more fireproof and resistant to magic than their metallic counterparts. The ceramic equipment is more easily broken, and as a result Firman combat methods are focused on agility rather than brute strength. After their secession from Ferrinoth, they strengthened their trade relations with Zephyria and have gained some technologies as a result.  Obsidia is home to Amalur's orcs, goblins, and other dark creatures. It is said that it was also home to dragons, but the dwarves drove them back to extinction in the Umbrian War. Zephyria maintains trade relations with Obsidia, as its volcanic materials are used in many crafts, even those of the Firman dwarves who swear off any relations with them and consider them an ancient enemy.  Southern Amalur has been isolated since the Umbrian war. They have very minimal interaction with the Zephyrians and destroy any craft which lands there without prejudice. As a result, everyone has agreed to leave them alone. If the continent has kingdoms, their names were forgotten long ago. As far as what happens in the campaign, I want to keep that secret in case any of the people playing it end up reading. But anyone who reads this is free to guess what may transpire given the clues I've left here ;P"

ArtistLounge,301h51,crimsonochre,4,Mon Mar 23 18:43:29 2015 UTC,"As an artist? So far, no. But I absolutely played with the thought a while because it would grant me the freedom of acting as a different persona. Being the center or attention and criticism on exhibits can be hard. Although I have only done 4 real ones so far."
ArtistLounge,301h51,Onomaya,4,Mon Mar 23 19:22:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as an artist. I'm thinking about not using my name while starting a painting-comics thing with some friends. I'm not fond of attention. Social anxiety is probably the main reason for this. Anyone else care to share your thoughts too?"
ArtistLounge,301h51,kaisengaard,5,Mon Mar 23 20:38:03 2015 UTC,"I think using your real name makes more sense if you're a traditional painter or something like that. As a digital artist I don't really feel the need to use my real name, unless I get to the point where I'm super good (and someone somewhere might actually care about my real name).  Using a pseudonym (or multiple pseudonyms) also let's you experiment and try different things without permanently attaching your name. That way you can screw up royally with no real issue :)"
ArtistLounge,301h51,Yam0048,2,Mon Mar 23 20:46:02 2015 UTC,"I do like the idea of having different names for different styles. One of my favorite cartoonists, Jean Giraud, did this by using the name Moebius for all his sci-fiction and fantasy. Cheers!"
ArtistLounge,301h51,AGamerDraws,4,Tue Mar 24 11:24:38 2015 UTC,"Not that I have anything published or anything at all, but I've always figured I'd like to use a pseudonym because coming up with something interesting or clever would be fun and perhaps good for catching people's eyes.  If nothing else I'd like to use my middle initials. RC... sounds pretty manly, doesn't it? Stands for ""rose chaparral"". So manly."
ArtistLounge,301h51,AGamerDraws,3,Mon Mar 23 21:55:47 2015 UTC,"I have different names for different things, but I wouldn't really call them pseudonyms because I also go as my real name for everything too. EG. I have a company/publishing name but I use my real name as the artist/author and then I use names that are similar to the publishing name for almost all of my social media so that it's easier to google than my name."

ArtistLounge,2zyz65,JustOkCaiters,3,Mon Mar 23 02:37:20 2015 UTC,"For a big of a comparison, Here is a painting I did only four months ago. While it's not bad, it's... y'know. Not great.   Anyways, I can't exactly say why I haven't felt great about my art lately. I do a creative activity every day, yet I was just feeling insecure. But when I took a break from RGD and did this study from /r/humanporn it really got me excited again- a kind of excitement I haven't felt in a long time.   Has anyone else felt similarly?"
ArtistLounge,2zyz65,Jacken_the_,3,Mon Mar 23 02:46:43 2015 UTC,"I feel like this constantly, and for no real reason. I can't tell you how to stop it, but continuing to do something creative regularly will help I think.   As of CC, your eyes are easily the strongest feature in both portraits, but I think the noses are the weakest. I think the lack of shadow on the tip of the man's nose is distorting the shape that the outline creates.   Keep up the good work mate."

ArtistLounge,2zyz65,inbetweendoodles,2,Mon Mar 23 11:13:08 2015 UTC,"I feel like there was a whole year long period of that feeling for me but I just kept plugging through and teaching myself as much as possible. Because no matter how upset I was with my art, I kept telling myself that a month ago I wouldn't have been able to do what I can now. It helped me a lot. I also improved super drastically over the last year and a half because of just how much art I made and how much I studied other peoples painting. I know I have said and posted this before but I think it might be really useful for other people to see how far you can go in a short time if you love what you do and just keep doing it!  The past year and a half, I went from this , to this , to this! .  And I am sorry, because I have posted this before, it's annoying to share again but I always felt inspired when I saw improvement posts. Yours inspires me even more! Good job working hard and improving! Also the painting is beautiful and the eyes are absolutely gorgeous."

It's overpriced for the quality of paper,  they outsource to Chinese sweatshops, etc.  These journals have a much higher integrity and imo they are just better:  Handbook journals- these ones are my favorite. Hardcover, lots of sizes. I use watercolor on these sometimes.  Might be your best bet.  Ciak - pretty similar to moleskine.  Really cool Italian company.  Softcover.    Palomino - bunch of different types including the Blackwing and Fabio Ricci lines.  Maybe more for sketching than markers.  Ecosystem- Really cool alternative.  100% post consumer recycled materials.  Maybe the most similar to moleskine.

ArtistLounge,2zwmag,asparagas,5,Thu Mar 26 07:35:28 2015 UTC,Have you thought of making your own? Buy sketchbook pads of better quality paper and make one!  (Practice making one with regular paper first though.)  It's very satisfying to make your own sketch book.
ArtistLounge,2zwmag,asparagas,1 point,Sun Mar 22 20:21:57 2015 UTC,"Yah, I have a book that just said the same thing, but I think I would have a hard time with the binding being sewn or stapled."

ArtistLounge,2zwmag,muddycrash,2,Sun Mar 22 22:20:13 2015 UTC,How it would feel. Although building a book press and trying this out seems like the perfect project after I get a workbench in my new garage next month. Maybe after a few tries and a good paper cutter I can get something clean after a few attempts.
ArtistLounge,2zwmag,guiscard,1 point,Sun Mar 22 22:59:36 2015 UTC,"But moleskines usually have stitched pages? What's wrong with the feel?  I did a couple notebooks. Just used old cardboard scrapes for backing, a good ruler, and an xacto knife. I used a dictionary and some weights as a book press lol. When I finally have time/money though, I would love to make a book press. :>"
ArtistLounge,2zwmag,inbetweendoodles,1 point,Mon Mar 23 00:11:54 2015 UTC,"Yah, I'm being a diva. I'm less of a artist and more of a designer, so I'm not confident my lines would be clean enough in the process, and I don't want to see the seems on the outside, I guess the main homemade sketchbook version I've seen has the thread visible outside. Some laziness too. Its hard enough for me to find the time to learn how to draw better let alone create a sketchbook to do it in."

ArtistLounge,2zv3ik,tocilog,4,Sun Mar 22 07:51:33 2015 UTC,"I had a doodle of a character (that will most likely exist nowhere other than my own head) that I liked and might explore further later.

ArtistLounge,2zsyi3,AGamerDraws,3,Sat Mar 21 13:37:48 2015 UTC,"What I currently struggle with is color.  I've breezed through some books and blogs about color theory, which have been very helpful, but it seems like most sources approach it from more of an academic standpoint.  As someone who wants to learn how to apply the theory, this can leave me a bit unhelped.  My usual method is to just put some color pairings together and constantly adjust as I go.  However, whenever I see a speedpaint video or something, most people seem to either have or quickly create a full palette.  I don't really know how to pick colors in a meaningful way, other than what I just think looks good at the time (plus real basic stuff like complementary colors and contrasting hue/saturations).  What would really be nice is having more walkthroughs or speedpaints where people explain the color-picking process."
ArtistLounge,2zsyi3,kaisengaard,2,Sat Mar 21 18:33:25 2015 UTC,"I learned color by using color badly, or what I thought was badly.  I had this painting I did of a dragon curled around a hand. The dragon I was determined to paint GREEN. It was a GREEN dragon. Every shade of green, goddamit!   The hand? Eh, it was just there. I painted it swirlies with purples and shades of skin tones, pinks and yellows, some green and blues.  .... and the hand ended up looking awesome, while the dragon was dull and lifeless.  I learned to hell with colors. Spots of color deserve to be everywhere. You need a little shadow? Use purple or blue. Need some light? Add a very, very pale green. Colors belong everywhere and on everything, even where it doesn't seem like it should belong."
ArtistLounge,2zsyi3,CuriosityK,3,Thu Mar 26 16:30:41 2015 UTC,"I recommend doing master studies where you manually colour pick (or try to match if you are working traditionally). Really observe exactly what colours they are using and where they are putting them.  I think the reason it's so science based is because it teaches you concepts so that you can apply them to all things. For example, if you know that shadows are always the opposite hue than the main coloured light (not white, coloured) then you know that if you have an orange light you will end up with a blue shadow etc.  Here's a video that might help. It focuses on painting skin colours, but shows using lots of other colours that you wouldn't normally associate with skin to create a realistic effect."
ArtistLounge,2zsyi3,inbetweendoodles,1 point,Sat Mar 21 21:00:18 2015 UTC,"I struggled with color a lot too. I started using a lot of pre-made color palettes and over time I have noticed that when I choose my own colors I have a better sense of what goes together. I don't know if that helps at all, but it helped me a lot!"
ArtistLounge,2zsyi3,but_not_by_wolves,1 point,Sat Mar 21 19:54:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, this!  Colour scares the crap out of me!  But then again, I haven't spent much time working on it either, so I just blame my laziness at this point : )"
ArtistLounge,2zsyi3,inbetweendoodles,3,Sat Mar 21 22:56:19 2015 UTC,"For me, the past year and a half has been pretty much dedicated to really learning how to paint. I haven't spent as much time on anatomy and other stuff as I probably should but I felt like...wow I don't actually know if I know how to explain this. Hmm...  I went from this ,to this ,to this in a little under a year and a half. The whole time, I just studied the way people painted. It felt really frustrating for a while and like there was a block like you talked about earlier that I just couldn't jump over or get around. I think my problem was feeling that each brushstroke was it's own separate thing. I just don't know how to use words for this. I started learning to see the painting as a whole and see how every stroke affects all of it rather than zoom in real close and only concentrate on the immediate bit. I also came to a kind of realization that each brush stroke was just a bit of smeared pigment on top of more smeared pigment. I guess what I mean by this is that it kind of demystified (if that is even a word) painting for me. I don't know how to explain it, but that, I think, was when I broke through the barrier. I think that was my cheat/trick. Being silly and thinking too deep about brushstrokes helped me see the whole. Sorry if this wasn't a very good explanation.  Now I get to struggle with hands. But I figure that just practicing a little every day is the way to get better with that."
ArtistLounge,2zsyi3,but_not_by_wolves,2,Sat Mar 21 19:53:35 2015 UTC,"Wow, it's amazing to see the progression you made, in under a year! I think what you are saying makes sense to me - I wouldn't be able to explain it either! I love your latest piece!"

ArtistLounge,2zq130,AGamerDraws,1 point,Fri Mar 20 19:43:09 2015 UTC,"You can also live stream on twitch.tv with OBS. Twitch is primarily focussed on games, but I've seen both art and programming/development streams on there. It's super easy to set up OBS to do this, just give it your twitch account login and you're done. Streaming is pretty cpu intensive, and you need a decent internet connection - I'd say a 2M minimum upload speed to get a good quality stream.  If you want to archive your broadcasts, they can be saved as highlights (twitch only stores the original broadcast for 2 weeks otherwise). Highlights can also be uploaded to your youtube channel with a single click. It's a nice easy solution if you're not bothered about post-editing."
ArtistLounge,2zq130,Varakkys,2,Sat Mar 21 16:11:39 2015 UTC,"Be careful with Twitch!  The following is from Twitch's rules of conduct:  In addition to our Terms of Service , we provide the following list of behaviors that could lead to suspension of your account ... Non-gaming, non-music content: Video games, board games, card games, fantasy sports, LARP games, and acceptable music content (see above). And while it's nice to take a break and just chill out with your audience, please ensure that your channel's primary focus is on gaming or music creation.  If the artwork you are making is not directly related to gaming then you will run the risk of having your channel/account shut down."
ArtistLounge,2zq130,AGamerDraws,1 point,Sat Mar 21 17:48:39 2015 UTC,"Oh, I didn't know about that. Thanks for pointing it out.   It's a pretty confusing list though. In what situation are video games classed as non-gaming content? oO"
ArtistLounge,2zq130,ObeyMyBrain,1 point,Sat Mar 21 19:40:08 2015 UTC,"I think those are examples of acceptable content, it's poorly worded though. But, essentially keep everything gaming centric."
ArtistLounge,2zq130,ObeyMyBrain,3,Sat Mar 21 20:23:44 2015 UTC,"Like /u/AGamerDraws I use OBS to record my videos. Here's a video tutorial on how to set up OBS for local recording.  To shrink it down from 1-2 hours to 5 or so minutes I use a program called Avidemux. One of the video filters allows you to change your FPS and changes the video duration. The free Windows Movie Maker also allows you to do this but with my files from OBS it first has to process them before it can work on them, Avidemux doesn't have to do that so it's faster.  It was a little confusing figuring out how to use it but I've got the steps down to basically just setting the FPS filter and choosing the video output format.  For adding music I first don't record audio in OBS, then after I upload I go to the edit music tab and choose some music from youtube's library of royalty-free audio. You can search by genre and I find something about the same length that's ad-free. The quick way just lets you add one song but if you use youtube's video editor you can string multiple songs together, it just takes longer to edit and process. It would be nice to have more control over the music but it would add probably 10-15 minutes of processing time and more in editing to use Movie Maker to plug in music directly or the youtube video editor. There aren't a lot of options in their list that are around 5 minutes long. And using multiple shorter tracks would help to add more variety to my videos but the time it would take isn't really worth it to me right now.   You can also download youtube's royalty-free music to insert in using your own editor from their audio library page.  I would also like to find another source of free/roalty-free/pod-safe type songs.   Edit: As far as systems, I don't know how low you can go, I've got 12 GB ram on a probably 3 year old amd quad core phenom II 3.4 GHz processor and a Nvidia GTX 760 video card. I'm usually running Photoshop, OBS, 2 browsers (chrome and firefox) thunderbird email and usually wintv (I've got a tv card in my computer so watching my shows on 2nd monitor while drawing) all at the same time."

Since I don't have the money to acquire better software I use free the windows live media program to process the recordings. I did all my videos on a almost seven year old Samsung Laptop which can barely run WoW. Because of those performance issues I can't record and/or process HD-videos. I guess this would be the low-cost method... ;-)

It is a porcelain statue, I used acrylic paint and super glue to place the spikes. The spikes are cheap jewelry making supplies from Michaels with a flaky silver coating. My questions are how can I seal this for protection and keep it matte, I do not want the piece to have a glossy finish. When I seal it could it possibly damage the spikes or break down the super glue."
ArtistLounge,2zo753,funisher,2,Fri Mar 20 05:37:40 2015 UTC,"They make spray matte varnishes that might do the trick. If there is a particular sealant you had your eye on you could also use that, and if its glossy just spray the matte varnish on top. I've seen artists do that with resin pieces and it worked nicely. The super glue should be fine.  One thing to keep in mind though is that paint is only as strong as the first layer. Acrylic is pretty good at binding to surfaces anyway (hence gesso being acrylic based) but I'm hoping you primed the bust before painting. It probably will be fine regardless but that is where it usually counts the most."

They're going to be embarrassed that someone called them out.  I wouldn't bother contacting the school. They aren't going to care. I have a BFA, went to a private art school, and had someone directly steal a very specific idea from me then show it. There were many teachers who saw my work, then saw his a semester later, and said absolutely nothing about it. A few students came up to me and told me about it, I had no idea. I thought back and remembered the art thief coming into my studio and hanging around for about two hours complimenting my paintings, then he started criticizing them very strongly, calling the fact that I used gold paint ""tacky."" The fact that he then ripped me off made it even more infuriating, and that professors were telling him how great it was really stung.

ArtistLounge,2zhuye,k0nundrum,5,Wed Mar 18 18:37:23 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking a grid is not ""cheating"" it's a tool for learning to see things in a different way. It is best only to use the grid for placement of the features of the face and not for every detail. Simple tracing also is good for this purpose.   But if the purpose is to achieve a precise likeness (like if you have a client who wants a particular photo reference used) other methods are better. I have used my computer to enlarge a photo to the size I need then ""posterizing"" it to achieve a more simple black-and-white line image. Then print it out in sections, tape the sections together and use this with a transfer sheet to trace just the lines I need for proportion and placement on my paper or canvas. It sounds involved, but it actually saved me time and the frustration of trying to get the initial drawing correct (it's not so bad now that I have proper glasses, but I used to struggle with being able to draw without things slanting upward on the right side... every. single. time.). In the ""old days"" I used an opaque projector to accomplish the same thing. When you  need to please a client, use whatever tools you can to help, because they'll notice something off and may insist on a correction.  Another, less techie version of the above, is to make your initial drawings on a piece of tracing paper. You can erase to your heart's content and don't have to worry about how hard you are pressing with your pencil. When you have a good likeness and composition (or need a cleaner sheet to continue), put a graphite transfer sheet (which is like old-fashioned carbon paper except using graphite) under it and gently trace onto a clean paper. You can easily print a grid on a paper and put your tracing paper over this, then have a smaller grid printed on a transparency to place over the photo. That way you never have to draw another grid!  Someone posted about flipping the image in order to see it afresh, and I have used another similar method of drawing initially with the source photo upside-down to help disengage the left-brain way of seeing (""it's an eye, and an eye is like this:...."") so you are drawing what you actually see. (an idea learned from ""Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain"").  But the one method that I use most is the animator's ""flick"": putting drawing and source close to one another (right-side up or up-side down) and quickly flicking my glance between the two, focussing on one feature at a time. If no ""animation-like"" motion is detected, you've got a good likeness, if anything seems to ""move"" then something is off. It takes some practice to determine in what way it is off, but it's very effective for me.  This is where the tracing paper method of developing a drawing comes in very handy. If I flick my eyes between photo and drawing focussed on the mouth, and my drawn mouth appears to move down, then I know I need to bring it up a bit. Using tracing paper, I can trace what parts are good, then move the old sketch up underneath the new paper until the mouth is in the right spot, then trace it there.   Gosh, I really didn't intend to write a whole lecture... :P"
ArtistLounge,2zhuye,the-tinidril,1 point,Thu Mar 19 00:51:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your time and detailed response!  Sounds like I should invest in some transfer paper and play around with it. I've been putting my finished drawing into Photoshop and making is more/less transparent when lined up over the reference photo, but given that I'm doing it at the end, it's just demoralizing.  But that might help, similar to your eye flicking suggestion, after lightly sketching out the basic features."
ArtistLounge,2zhuye,the-tinidril,2,Thu Mar 19 06:55:25 2015 UTC,"You're welcome! :D And do try the tracing paper. It's cheap, easy to erase and makes a nice crinkly sound! hehehe. I think you'll find it frees you to keep working on the likeness until you're satisfied and then you can feel confident once you transfer the drawing that you can just concentrate on rendering form and shading."
ArtistLounge,2zhuye,the-tinidril,1 point,Thu Mar 19 22:21:25 2015 UTC,"Also, I love the different styles of your art! Very cool!"
ArtistLounge,2zhuye,kaisengaard,2,Thu Mar 19 07:19:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks! :D I am somewhat of a chameleon when it comes to ""style"", heh."
ArtistLounge,2zhuye,kaisengaard,6,Thu Mar 19 22:13:57 2015 UTC,"Gridlines are great for getting something to look realistic, but I agree that it feels like more of a hindrance than something that helps.  I don't use them and generally argue against using them.  What I'd recommend is just holding your drawing up to the light backwards (so you can see what it looks like mirrored).  Digital artists flip their canvas often, because our eyes are easily tricked.  Flipping the canvas can bring things our eyes kind of fuzzed right into our field of view.  It's crazy!  It helps me a ton when working on proportions.  If you were really gung-ho you could get a lightbox and use that, but honestly just holding drawings up to the light is a great trick.  Rather than gridlines, I think you should focus on guides for the general shapes of things.  I'm talking about stuff like this and this.  It's more important to know how pieces relate to one another, than something as fixed as gridlines.  Having that skill will allow you to, for example, take someone's picture and draw what they'd look like facing a different way.  If you're really comfortable with using gridlines, then I think it's fine to use them as long as you try it without as well.  Pretty much any tool that you use exclusively can be a hindrance if you never branch away from it."
ArtistLounge,2zhuye,Spencypoo,1 point,Wed Mar 18 19:39:12 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I use the circle/curve general shape of things for most drawings, but have been using grid-lines for portraits that I'm really trying for super-realism. But I think I'm going to try for the next detailed portrait to do it without the grid-lines, and see how it goes.   I like the flipping idea... I will definitely try it out. :)"
ArtistLounge,2zhuye,Spencypoo,3,Wed Mar 18 22:10:38 2015 UTC,"Okay, that makes total sense.  I checked your art and see that you're pretty awesome! I know Chuck Close used grids in his hyper-realistic paintings, so what do I know? :)  If you're switching between grids and no-grids, I think it'll help train your mind in a good way.  Keep up the good work!"

And there are so many good ideas for alternatives here, that I can cycle through them and see what works best for me."
ArtistLounge,2zdkhi,headcrab1991,3,Tue Mar 17 18:21:17 2015 UTC,"Its really good! Now some critique: Background looks unfinished.  It doesn't hold the same level of contrasts and detail that the primary foreground figure portrays, as if it was just an afterthought. If it was purely a stylistic choice, then I don't think it works.  Anyway, still cool."
ArtistLounge,2zdkhi,megapaw,1 point,Tue Mar 17 21:21:22 2015 UTC,"It wasn't an afterthought, I deliberately kept it in relatively solid blocks of color and avoided detail. Can you tell what doesn't work about it? I think I'm in too deep to judge that properly.  Thanks a lot for the critique and the appreciation!"
ArtistLounge,2zdkhi,thechicksareemerging,2,Tue Mar 17 21:31:14 2015 UTC,"The leaf to the left doesn't work because the figure is looking to his right, and because the lines of the gaps in the leaf point directly to the eyes of the figure with some of the lines in the figure pointing at the leaf. Your eye does a couple of loops there before looking at other parts of the piece. So, I believe is more of a placement problem rather than technique problem. i.e. the leaf is in too prominent position, so the difference of detail is distracting.   That being said, I really love this piece.  The figure is intriguing and unnerving. The fact that you didn't include him in a dark and shadowy painting, instead placing him in a bright setting, makes me wonder about the life of your subject. Very cool."

Her right shoulder, the one on our left looks flat, and the anatomy is just a bit wonky.   It's not too shabby, the way to improve on the next piece would be to keep anatomy in mind."

My critique would be for the face/neck. I think it just needs more definition. Where her jawline should be, get some shadow in there (similar to how you have the shadow on the other side of her face or near her armpit). And I think her head is maybe... too long? Maybe round it out and don't be afraid to work horizontally (much of your drawing is up and down, don't hesitate to work side to side as well)."

I think the background looks great, and the only colours that are bothering me are the white and the blue of her shoes.    I think the issue is that these colours are just too bright.  Under the night sky you've drawn, a white hoodie would look significantly darker than that.  Same with the shoes.  These colours just wouldn't exist in the light you've created.  Which is why it feels wrong.    I think the colours of the background are great and unified.  The only other thing bothering me are the clouds, but I'm not sure why.  They just don't read to me.  I think it's because the sun has mostly set based on how dark the top of your sky is, and that's not reading in your clouds.  I would google images of sunsets and use references, cause stuff like that can be really tricky to create totally from scratch without it looking really unnatural.    Hope that helps!"

For the latter use construction lines as much as possible, essentially plan out the face to all the correct proportions before you even get stuck into the drawing."
ArtistLounge,2ywxh1,AGamerDraws,1 point,Fri Mar 13 16:14:54 2015 UTC,"It's not just the placement and proportions though, it's recreating the left eye on the right side, or things of that nature. Even if one side is higher up, getting the two sides to look right together is super difficult for me."
ArtistLounge,2ywxh1,AGamerDraws,2,Fri Mar 13 16:27:11 2015 UTC,But...that is placement and proportions...?
ArtistLounge,2ywxh1,AGamerDraws,1 point,Fri Mar 13 16:38:31 2015 UTC,"I mean like, eye shape. Not where the eye is located. Im just using eye as an example."
ArtistLounge,2ywxh1,CuriosityK,2,Fri Mar 13 16:42:44 2015 UTC,Maybe you need to study straight up anatomy then? Understanding how the eye shape morphs as the head turns etc. It's still fixed by doing good construction lines though.
ArtistLounge,2yvcoo,semily444,3,Fri Mar 13 02:54:49 2015 UTC,"Here's my two cents: It depends. If your client is commissioning a portrait of their family they wish to hang up, then it might be considerate to charge them slightly less for a digital piece considering they will have to absorb the cost of getting it printed, either that or charge them full price and make the print yourself.   If your customer is looking for a piece that will be exclusively digital (concept art, backgrounds, etc.) then there isn't a strong need to provide a discount.  The most important factor in determining price is skill. At the end of the day they're paying for your talent, not particularly for pixels or canvas, and that's where the biggest portion of the value lies."
ArtistLounge,2yvcoo,c_l_z,2,Fri Mar 13 03:04:25 2015 UTC,I think you are so right that it definitely comes down to skill.  I also really like the idea of varying the price depending on if it gets printed by me or them. I hadn't considered that.  Thank you so much for your two cents! It gives me lots to think about!
ArtistLounge,2yvcoo,kyleclements,2,Fri Mar 13 03:16:59 2015 UTC,"As far as I'm concerned, it's the image, not the medium, that matters.  If it's a one-off, treat it like a traditional painting, and price it accordingly.  If it's going to be multiple prints, than treat it like you would a series of prints or photographic reproductions.  But if you are treating it like prints, then don't charge like it's a one-of-a-kind original.  As long as you avoid that, you're in the clear in my books."
ArtistLounge,2yvcoo,J-u-l-y,2,Fri Mar 13 04:49:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that makes sense! Thank you. I guess I was thinking that even though it is a one off, it's also a print. But it's still an original.   Thanks again! This really helps!"
ArtistLounge,2yvcoo,Fey_fox,2,Fri Mar 13 22:31:36 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to note that I think some people, customers or not, might have the opinion of digital work being less valued because you aren't spending money on paint, canvas, wood, brushes etc.   Except that you definitely are spending ""material cost"" in digital too, the costs are just different. Photoshop is an expense if thats what you use, some people purchase digital brushes and textures, fonts etc. Your computer is another material expense for digital work.   But at the end of the day, a client can have all those things and they can't produce your art, so that is the real value as others have said.   I don't think there should be a real price difference strictly based on the difference between a digital and traditional approach. Your price differences will still come from time spent, how detailed the final piece is, size and so on."
ArtistLounge,2yvcoo,Dmunman,2,Fri Mar 13 08:21:32 2015 UTC,"I didn't even think about the digital costs, like buying the program. That is so true!   Yeah, I definitely agree that it should be a price based on time, detail, etc.   Thank you so much for your thoughts! Definitely gives me some clarity."
ArtistLounge,2yvcoo,kyleclements,2,Fri Mar 13 22:34:47 2015 UTC,"No, charge the same.   You have to pay for art supplies in traditional art, but you have to pay for the program you use to make digital work. Also in both instances you are charging for your talent. The time you put into learning how to make art is the same, so why charge less? Unless you feel like your digital skills are way inferior & you're producing lesser work I see no reason to charge less for digital stuff as a commission.   If you are selling your own work as a print, if treat them as such though. Just like a traditional printmaker may spend many hours on a plate to sell their work at 20, 50 or whatever, so should you. I'd opt for limited editions personally vs open, makes the art more special."

ArtistLounge,2yoqzs,JustOkCaiters,1 point,Wed Mar 11 15:42:48 2015 UTC,"I was really inspired by /u/chrisconlon and his art and wanted to push myself outside of my comfort zone to create something. I looked at a lot of comic art which turned into a few hours of just dorking off and reading comics...  But uh, heh.  Things I struggled with:   Brushes. As stupid as this sounds, I had no idea what brush to use, and kept flipping from hard to soft and it shows (in not a good way) Knowing the appropriate amount of shading. Line colors. I really wanted to do a gradient on the linework layer and had no idea how to go about that. I was so sucked into working that I forgot google exists. I have since googled to my heart's content."
ArtistLounge,2yoqzs,chrisconlon,1 point,Wed Mar 11 15:48:05 2015 UTC,"Gwahhh I love it! It looks so sweet! Don't be discouraged if it's difficult at first. Cartooning is a skill in its own. People take it for granted that even though it may look easier to draw, developing a style and figuring out how to artfully omit detail takes a lot of practice.  I'll try and help out with the stuff you struggled with!  Brushes: As far as line goes, I use Manga Studio. The pen tool acts and looks a lot like a brush or brush pen does. It's far and away my favorite program for getting ""traditional"" looking linework. If you're working in Photoshop, just use a pressure sensitive hard round brush to start out. There's a lot of cartoon/comic brush packs out there as well, so feel free to search around :]    Brushes (for coloring): When I color, I start by adding flats under my line work. When I started, I limited myself to three tones per color area (shadow, midtone, highlight) but lately I've let myself get into four or five. The way I color is ctrl+clicking the image thumbnail next to the layer to select the area and then pressing ctrl+h to hide the little ants that dance around the selection. By doing this I make it so I don't color outside the lines and I stay in the area of color I'm working in. (If this is confusing, let me know and I'll send you a link to a demonstration of this.) Here's what the finished product may look like!  Proper amount of shading: For cartooning, less is more in my eyes. I would limit yourself to hard edged shadows and highlights and then move into experimenting with more realistic shading. When I started working in this style, I just had a flat midtone and a shadow, but now I work in 3-5 tones.  Line Colors: Ctrl+click the image thumbnail next to the lineart layer in the layers menu. This will select only the lineart and you should be able to go in with the gradient tool and color it as you please. Again, you can press ctrl+H to hide the little ants that dance around a selection, but remember to press it again if you want to see them later. Also, I would work on a new layer so that you preserve a copy of your original lineart layer. If you want more control, use a soft brush/airbrush to color the line. You get a little more precision and the edges of the brush have a gradient effect.   Hope you had fun! I'm honored to have inspired you :] Maybe one day I'll make a video tutorial on my process so I don't have to ramble like a maniac in a comment like I did just now! Lemme know if you have any questions."

Tentacle hentai is exactly where I took it :p  I think you could get around the ""wrapped up"" thing by making it look more like a part of her, rather than something she's wearing.

ArtistLounge,2ykxb0,J-u-l-y,5,Tue Mar 10 22:32:08 2015 UTC,"I prefer the one on the right as the large jelly head and thin body makes for an interesting silhouette.

For some reason it made me think of the painted lady in the avatar series like here but that isn't anything close to a jellyfish just made me think of it, in a very beautiful way.   Also the glow and light would be more fun to play with as its reflected down and around her face so I think that also makes for a more interesting visual piece  Overall I think both concepts look great, but I'm drawn towards the one on the right more :)"
ArtistLounge,2ykxb0,FeralQueen,2,Wed Mar 11 04:27:08 2015 UTC,"Additional information:  The first one was my original concept - it's a more traditional mermaid with a jellyfish bottom instead of a fish bottom. To me it kind of looks like a burgermaid right now but that'd be fixed with more rendering.   My boyfriend was the one who suggested the second one. Here was my thumbnail. He thinks the second one's better. However, my art teacher said the second one might feel a bit weird and might make people uncomfortable as it feels like she's being wrapped in a jellyfish.  I honestly like both for different reasons, I just can't choose. So I'm trying to get some other opinions."

I'm not sure what your overall goal is or what your assignment requires, but maybe going for a more, ""abyssal creature of the deep"" or even simply ""floating and serene"" look would be more appealing than the ""Disney princess"" vibe I'm getting now. Still, it's entirely up to you, just something I noticed!  As for the ""creepy"" comment, maybe just having a clear transition between ""woman"" and ""jellyfish body"" so it doesn't look like two different entities. :3  Maybe think of a more dynamic tentacle arrangement as well. Right now it's fairly simple and straight forward, with tentacles hanging directly below her. With the fluid nature of jellyfish, and all the colorful variations possible, you have a LOT of options! Play with shape and flow and color, look at tons and tons of photos, and play with your favorite elements you see.   Here are just a few I found googling:  One  Two  Three  Four  Five  Six  Anyway, hope this helps, try your best for a strong and dynamic impact!  *edit, typos and extra words"
ArtistLounge,2ykxb0,iopenatthenose,4,Tue Mar 10 22:26:27 2015 UTC,"""Disney princess"" vibe   lol! It's the pose. Goddammit, I can't unsee. In my rough comp she's supposed to be touch a jelly fish so that's why her pose is like that for now. (This is my rough comp layout.)   ""cute/pretty"" side   All my artwork ends up cute-ish. ;___; No matter how much I try to do ""epic!"" I fail. (It's what made me draw this hueheuehu.)  Thanks for the eloquent and detailed post! I definitely have a large reference folder full of jellyfish and gelatinous tentacle-y forms which I keep adding more and more to."

ArtistLounge,2ykfo3,AGamerDraws,3,Tue Mar 10 15:41:39 2015 UTC,"I think I would draw a distinction between appreciating work and actively supporting it. I know I hate it if i find out something bad about an artist, actor, etc. I like. On some level that knowledge will always color your vision. Social media is a double-edged sword for sure. It gives you exposure and a way to connect with people. The problem is that the bad comes with the good.  The thing is I'm actually ok with this. If someone is dumb enough to be a total douche on social media, then I don't really feel bad if their sales suffer. That's the risk they take.  For your own benefit, you can try to appreciate the technique of someone even if you don't patronize their wares.  I really liked Kevin Spacey's efforts to keep his private life private. He's so strict on it that no one outside his friends really know what he's like or what he does day to day.  Kevin said he does this specifically so people won't have a clouded view of his work."
ArtistLounge,2ykfo3,kaisengaard,3,Tue Mar 10 16:07:16 2015 UTC,I hate Damien Hirst's and Tracey Emin's art with a passion and I know it is wrong but that hatred was transferred across to themselves as hatred towards persons too.

ArtistLounge,2yi89s,eggpl4nt,6,Tue Mar 10 00:45:14 2015 UTC,"I went the opposite direction, blogspot ➡️ Tumblr. I think it was more about letting go of a staid portfolio, and maybs the baggage, and trying something different & relatively newer. I don't like Tumblr's lack of time/date stamping, but even that has its benefits. Agree with ya about DA, but it could just be not my cup of tea?"
ArtistLounge,2yi89s,upjumptheboogieman,3,Tue Mar 10 03:06:54 2015 UTC,I think the time/date stamp is up to the theme you choose; for instance my posts all get a date stamp but not a time stamp.  I bet you could find a theme with both—or if you know your way around a bit of code you could probably enable/disable them yourself somehow.
ArtistLounge,2yi89s,jackjohnbrown,2,Tue Mar 10 15:51:36 2015 UTC,"Word. I could tinker around with it, I suppose. Simplicity & ease of use of the T interface, blah blah blah I'm probably lazy with that side of it, but perhaps later I won't be?     Sidenote: I really dug your /u/Aline_Stec portrait!"

ArtistLounge,2yi89s,jackjohnbrown,5,Wed Mar 11 04:47:42 2015 UTC,"Just curious, what do you find illogical about the tumblr UI? I've never had any issues with it but wonder if we use it differently."
ArtistLounge,2yi89s,jackjohnbrown,2,Tue Mar 10 11:26:27 2015 UTC,"This shit?  It's irritating to use and balls slow. I don't need fancy pointless CSS3 animations popping up all the goddamn time when I highlight words or press enter, I want my menus to be fixed up at the top like all logical word editors have done in the past. Because it works.  It's gone the way of ""If it ain't broke - let's make it ""intuitive"" and shiny!"
ArtistLounge,2yi89s,jackjohnbrown,6,Tue Mar 10 15:23:14 2015 UTC,"Ah, gotcha. I don't really mind it (it's pretty snappy on my laptop at least) but I don't do a ton of long form posts on tumblr—it's mostly just posting an RGD drawing with maybe a line or two of caption. And I'm often doing that from my phone/iPad anyway.  I can see it being a pain though if you're doing a lot of writing in tumblr and other text editors; kind of jarring to go back and forth.  On the other hand, I totally agree with you about DeviantArt...it's always felt very juvenile to me (no offense to you DA folks around here!)."
ArtistLounge,2yi89s,oceana1009,3,Tue Mar 10 15:38:56 2015 UTC,"yeah, tumblr's interface is barely navigable at all, and there are so many things I find frustrating about it. (No useful way to see archived posts, no way to easily see responses vs. likes/reblogs, clogged feeds of shit if you follow more than like 20 people) Unfortunately blogger seems a bit dead these days and tumblr is still the best way to get anyone to see/follow your work. Like it or not, tumblr seems to be where any audience is. :/  If you just need a portfolio site though, blogspot is as good as the rest really. Wordpress also has tons of nice free or low cost portfolio type layouts that look very slick and professional.  Behance is an ok site, but it's much more for certain types of commercial work than anything else. It has simple layout features (per post/project), and you can comment, follow, and message people. A lot of pros use it, which means your work is more visible to industry folk/art directors/etc. Things move much more slowly than on tumblr though and it can take a long time for views/comments to accrue on behance vs other art sites, I've noticed.  A lot of game artists/concept artists are on ArtStation these days, and maybe a handful of comic artists and illustrators, but again, it seems like a real niche place in terms of commercial-ness and specific illustration styles, and thus not for everyone."
ArtistLounge,2yi89s,jackjohnbrown,3,Tue Mar 10 23:15:30 2015 UTC,"Not sure if this is what you mean by archived posts, but I love this feature: add ""/archive"" to the end of a tumblr site and you'll get the full archive of posts, divided by month. For instance, here is my site. And here is my site with /archive added to the end of the URL.  Once you're in the archive view, you can filter it to only show certain types of posts, or only posts from a certain month. Hope that helps!"
ArtistLounge,2yi89s,but_not_by_wolves,2,Wed Mar 11 03:25:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, this!  I almost always browse people's tumblr sites using Archive view, and have my own URL going directly to it! Can't really comment on the main interface, because I just post pics.."

About six months ago I made the piece up top to go along with this D&D-esque RPG I was making (still want to make it) called Illolife RPG. In the game, you create a character sheet for yourself that keeps track of your habits as an artist. You level up as you get complete ""quests"" and so on and so forth...  Anyway, I created the piece on top to go along with it. It's me with a brush pen sword and my girlfriend as a click-mage (the arrow is a mouse pointer because she's a graphic designer). It launched me into this weird and unexpected cartoonist phase I'm in now.  The style has evolved in the past few months and I decided to see what the piece would look like all new and shiny.

ArtistLounge,2yhvb2,oOReximusOo,2,Mon Mar 9 23:02:35 2015 UTC,"It's wonderful that you (an individual and assuming student)  are offering to pay for logo work in a college atmosphere. I say that because of ...  side story:  When I was in design classes the actual college theater department used our typography class for free....and posed it as a contest for our class/assignment. I won the contest out of our class of like maybe 18 students. I had to email different versions back and forth and make changes, and ultimately I spent about 10 extra hours working on a poster and t-shirt design that their paid employee failed to deliver to their satisfaction and skewed my logo and original art. I did get 1 free student ticket to the show though, which was 6 bucks. All in all it was cool to have the bragging rights, but 50 bucks would have been nice. It was good experience, but it was my first time even using illustrator and photoshop that semester so it was an intimidating endeavor.   I'm not really sure exactly how much logo work should go for at a student level. You aren't asking for branding a huge company so it's fairly different than what most things on a google search would tell you.   Things to think about are: Do you need multiple versions? full color, black and white, Big concept, smaller concept for maybe the front corner of a t-shirt? Are you going to need a letter head or business card for your student organization?   Would you want the person who designs the logo for you to be open to future work for advertisements/posters/ future event shirts?  All of these factors determine the value of the work and what a good price point would be. How many hours will this project take a design student. Some students might do comissions on the side and already have prices and a business model in place. Others are probably eager to do it for fun and pro-bono because they don't have any experience.   I think $50 dollars is a little on the low end of the value, but I'm certain someone would work for that much in the college atmosphere. I have a friend who charges about 400 for logo and branding work, but she has her graphic design degree, and business contracts and everything.   I'm super sorry for the rambling! I hope this helps a little though"
ArtistLounge,2yhvb2,J-u-l-y,1 point,Tue Mar 10 00:23:28 2015 UTC,"I can't believe your class put up with treatment like that. Did they at least warn you that the ""winning"" submission would need be tailored? Was participation in the competition mandatory?"
ArtistLounge,2yhvb2,Enevon,3,Tue Mar 10 11:19:42 2015 UTC,"It was a mandatory assignment, it was for a grade. Winning offered a free ticket, and free t-shirt (but I never got a shirt) I don't really remember, but I feel like originally we only had to provide a black and white alternative if we used color in our logo. Of course after I got picked,(since I didn't do outside freelance work) I realized  that through the emails back and forth more was wanted from me. ""can we see the ribbon this color and this color"" They ultimately chose the original logo anyway, so it was a big waste of time.   All this emailing and altering and poster were done outside of class by me on my own time within the same week we started.  At the time I was on top of the world, ""yay I got picked!"" this is a great opportunity! ...looking back I'm like...dang, I was a college student, they should have given me a gift card to a restaurant or something! geez.   It definitely skewed my view of how my work is valued. I have found that if I try to charge for work, I don't get the job at all, they can always find someone who is willing to work for free. I have done a couple other things this way as favors... but its definitely not a business of mine. I have a normal office job for now, all this art stuff is a side hobby."
ArtistLounge,2yhvb2,J-u-l-y,2,Tue Mar 10 16:16:12 2015 UTC,"It's good that it was mandatory, that way I assume you at least got a top grade for your efforts.     I have found that if I try to charge for work, I don't get the job at all     Well if they weren't going to pay you, you wouldn't get any job even if they did choose you! Working for free is only good for getting more unpaid work.   Serious clients are prepared to compensate you fairly. It's always the ones that want something for free that give you the trouble. They can demand alterations for weeks after the final product has been delivered. The reason for this is simple, they don't respect our time or skills. If they valued our time they'd be willing to pay for it."
ArtistLounge,2yhvb2,Enevon,1 point,Wed Mar 11 14:48:05 2015 UTC,"I dug up the old emails, originally I was never supposed to do a poster  but  this and this is what their PAID designers came up with, one which skewed and altered my logo, and another which she hated. The theater arts department director was who I was coordinating with, and then she asked me if it was possible for me to come up with something better. I didn't want my logo skewed so I agreed. I was credited in the program pamphlet as a graphic designer for the production at least.   Mind you this was after only knowing and using illustrator for a month. This was my first design class ever. yeesh."
ArtistLounge,2yhvb2,J-u-l-y,2,Tue Mar 10 18:00:28 2015 UTC,"There is a big difference in what you should put up as a prize for a competition, and what you should pay if you are looking to hire a single person to carry out a commission.    Think of it like this, when you make it a competition you are essentially hiring all of the participants on the premise that only one of them get paid. The prize should reflect the total amount of work all participants have put in. Because you will only be using one of the submissions you get to pay a lot less than their hourly rate.    Lets say you expect to receive 10 usable submissions which would be about 3.5 hours of work each. That would mean that you should be paying for 35 work hours, at minimum wage (which would be considered insultingly low by most people except students) that comes out to about 250 dollars.     Now because this is a competition, you get to decide how much of the 250 you think is fair to pay out considering your budget.    If you are only looking to pay 50 dollars I'd say you should consider asking to see portfolio submissions in stead and straight out hire the best one."
ArtistLounge,2yf8yz,k0nundrum,10,Mon Mar 9 08:19:22 2015 UTC,"Looking at the reference picture there's a few thing's i've noticed:  The image is mostly mid tones, there's no really dark values or bright highlights, which the reference photo had plenty of. If you are having trouble recreating them because your pencil won't go dark enough then I would advise investing in an art pencil set so that you have a range of hardness' or working with charcoal/markers.  Anatomical issues  I have made a gif, sorry it's so small I used an online video to gif generator, hopefully you can still see the changes by zooming in and out. I have lined up the reference photo's girl's right eye with the same eye on your drawing. The eye in both images are the exact same size, so any size change is because the eye and image are not drawn accurately to scale. By fading in and out you can see how much you have changed the image.  Things to note: The angles of the heads, the girls hand, the width between the eyes, the shapes of the girl's cheeks and the droopiness of the eyelids of both children at this angle.  I would recommend tracing the original reference using a light table and comparing it to your original drawing. You've got a great start here and I like what you've done, but if you want something super realistic these are the changes I would recommend.  I hope this has helped."

I'll break out some books about different pencil darknesses, so I have a better handle on that.   Does anyone know of a work-around version of a light table?

ArtistLounge,2yf8yz,AGamerDraws,3,Mon Mar 9 18:29:58 2015 UTC,"No worries, I had a bit of time so thought i'd help. =]  If the picture isn't too big then holding it up to a computer monitor can work. Open a blank word document or white web page and hold the image up to the screen. Be carful that you trace lightly though so that you don't damage your screen.  Alternatively, you can do the holding up to a window thing, it can be hard to keep the artwork still enough though.  My light table is essentially just a slab of wood with a cut out filled with glass and a lamp underneath it so if you have any carpentry skills (or know someone who does) you may be able to make your own.

ArtistLounge,2yf8yz,kaesko,3,Tue Mar 10 03:09:04 2015 UTC,"First, this is a good effort. As a survival skill, our brains are highly efficient at reading minute changes in facial features in a split second. Even more so with people we are extremely familiar with (like our close family and friends). For this reason portraiture is perhaps the highest form of art.   It appears that either naturally, or because you projected the photo, you slightly distorted their faces, especially their left sides. Sargeant said that a portrait is a painting in which people comment ""The eyes are a little off."" Next time, I recommend printing out the photo reference and drawing a grid on it. Then, draw a grid over your paper and transfer it that way. You may still get camera distortion, but the drawing will look exactly like the photo. When you get more advanced in drawing, you can naturally compensate for all distortions. Overall, fair drawing attempt. Keep up the good work."
ArtistLounge,2yf8yz,Dmunman,1 point,Mon Mar 9 14:19:02 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Sadly, I actually did use a grid, and I still managed to mess it up. Maybe it will just take time and practice."

ArtistLounge,2ybqrm,ShadowMercure,8,Sun Mar 8 10:01:13 2015 UTC,"Great start.  You need to get the details more accurately rendered. Doing a good portrait is can be difficult. After all, the ultimate test of any portrait is if it actually looks like the person.  Sadly, in this case, it does not quite.   It is, of course, terribly unfair to make a comparison with a photo. Even so, you need to get the essence, the essential features correct.  lets look at this comparison.  http://i.imgur.com/JQPKvtk.jpg  changing the spacing of the nose and eyes helps some.   http://i.imgur.com/aezrsWk.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/nsKINYa.jpg  There are other small details like head shape, cheek bones, jawline, etc that are off in subtle ways. In your version the head is  longer and narrower than in real life, but that is a rather minor nit to pick. ( I actually stretched the photo to match the head height in your drawing)  I feel that if you got the basic proportions precise, and really nailed the eyes, that it would catch the essence of the character.  A major characteristic of the source photo is the direct stare at the viewer. Of course, you can have him looking off to the side, but then the other details need to be handled with greater precision. Right now his left eye (on the right side of the portrait) looks lazy, wandered off to the left more than his right eye, when eyes normally converge.  Of course, even a wildly distorted and exaggerated caricature can still look like a person and really do the job.   Check these out. some work better than others  https://www.google.com/search?q=caricature+dr+house&tbm=isch  I feel that many of these really got the eyes right, and everything else fell into place from there.  Again, it's a great start, you obviously have some skills. You need to fine tune them some, and you could be great."

It's all all a matter of really deciding what you really want to draw, sorting out the techniques needed to get your result, and seeing where things went off the rails. As you master more skills you get better control of the little details that bring it all to life.  For example, the comparison I did helps sort out the differences between what you did, and what you likely intended.  It is possible that you  drew the picture with the pad at an angle on your lap, which would contribute to the stretching of the head.  :-/"
ArtistLounge,2ybqrm,Scientologist2a,1 point,Sun Mar 8 21:11:02 2015 UTC,quite possibly. I just recently moved so the furniture is still getting moved into the new house. I currently don't even have access to a table so i indeed had my book on my lap >.<

ArtistLounge,2ybqrm,Scientologist2a,2,Mon Mar 9 00:36:32 2015 UTC,"Depends a bit, are you going for realism or caricature?"
ArtistLounge,2ybqrm,Brassawiking,2,Sun Mar 8 16:44:09 2015 UTC,"A typical primary feature of caricature is obviously and deliberately distorted and exaggerated characteristic features.  I would guess that he was trying for realism, but he needs better control and attention to detail."
ArtistLounge,2ybqrm,Scientologist2a,1 point,Sun Mar 8 17:07:48 2015 UTC,"The face is very thin and elongated, which sort of makes it look like caricature/realism hybrid. But I would also guess that realism is the aim for this piece."
ArtistLounge,2ybqrm,Brassawiking,2,Sun Mar 8 17:28:51 2015 UTC,"based on the angle of the paper, it might have been unconsciously drawn at an angle, the pad held on the lap angled away instead of square or a desktop, and it looked ok until they were done.  it happens and is an easy error to make."

ArtistLounge,2ydis3,not_safe_for_worf,4,Sun Mar 8 21:42:26 2015 UTC,"Hmmmm, this is so tough to pick just one piece of art. :D  I'll submit the most influential work on me from the past 5 or so years! Sarah and the Seed by Ryan Andrews: http://www.ryan-a.com/comics/sarahandtheseed01.htm (short comic, maybe 35 pages?)   I can definitively say that this comic was the work that made me want to start drawing comics the very most. I'd never seen any comic be so immersive. I was used to tiny words and squished panels like 6 to a page or more. But this little comic made me realize it doesn't have to be that way!!! The reader can glide enjoyably through the story, and feel every bit of it.   It also made me realize not everything has to be a multi-issue unwieldy beast, and I think in fact, you can probably reach out to more people with this format and make a greater impact."
ArtistLounge,2ydis3,k0nundrum,2,Mon Mar 9 00:32:59 2015 UTC,"Lovely comic. I read with trepidation that it would turn to horror, and instead it was just wonderful. Thank you for sharing."

ArtistLounge,2ydis3,headcrab1991,4,Mon Mar 9 17:19:24 2015 UTC,"I'll go! My choice this week is ""The Gossips"" by Norman Rockwell.  I don't typically love his work. It's odd - I know I should, and I can see his works contain an extraordinary amount of technique, but they never really grabbed me. This one, however, I love. And that is for the following reasons:   Holy lifelike faces, Batman! And so many faces! A+ for extra bonus challenge points He has the same faces making different expressions, and still managed to nail the likeness in each one. I like the humor of it, and how it begins and ends with the same person. Everyone can relate to the human behavior of gossiping.    That's it for me, see you next week! I really enjoy seeing everyone's choices each week."
ArtistLounge,2ydis3,FoxtrotOscar23,2,Sun Mar 8 21:45:54 2015 UTC,"Frank Brangwyn - The Last Supper  Oh boy I have been waiting for this. I took a short trip to Bruges in Belgium the last few days and at the end of a long day I decided on a whim to go into this small exhibition of Frank Brangwyn.  Never heard of the guy and my head was already filled by watching all the old masters in the museum next door (wonderful paintings) but what I saw then really blew my head off. I instantly became a big fan and I was especially impressed by a series of drawings depicting Jesus from the trial to being taken down from the cross. The last one wasn't a drawing but a big painting, about 1.5x1.5 m in dimension, which has had me in awe for like fifteen minutes. It's pretty rare for me to be stunned like this. I've searched quite a bit but sadly couldn't find this particular painting on the internet.  If you want to see more work I'd recommend this site from the BBC. I know this can be said about many painters but he really had a way with colors and a very accurate view. I love how fresh and lifelike most of it seems. I couldn't really pick something that is a clear favorite (except for the unfindable jesus-cross one) but I just wanted to show you people this amazing guy, maybe he is as new to you as he was to me."
ArtistLounge,2ydis3,sgt_mary_mary,2,Mon Mar 9 00:39:58 2015 UTC,"So, so many it's nearly impossible to choose just one, but right now my favourite that's probably influencing me is This, Venus, by Shane Wolf  I just love it, the palette, the movement, the realism, the scale, the deconstructed parts that give it movement and make it feel modern and fresh. I pretty much love everything from his Eidolon series."
ArtistLounge,2ydis3,slam_nine,4,Mon Mar 9 02:21:25 2015 UTC,"This illustration by Tove Jansson.  So, back to children's books this week! I loved Moomin as a child, and I'm still in love with the illustrations. There are so many wonderful  ones by Jansson, but I ended up picking this one due to the richness of detail in it. I'm somewhat frightened of the deep ocean, so looking at this is a bit unsettling for me. In a good way! Some of those creatures look so sinister with their creepy smiles.   I absolutely adore the line work. I'm especially fond of the linear hatching she often uses to depict the sky. It looks so neat. And the  areas of solid black are incredibly pleasing."
ArtistLounge,2ydis3,k0nundrum,3,Sun Mar 8 21:48:14 2015 UTC,Awesome choice! I used to copy her illustrations from the books when I was young. I'm still a big fan of both her illustrations and comic strips.
ArtistLounge,2ydis3,OftenPyr,2,Mon Mar 9 02:01:54 2015 UTC,"Love this one! I was also obsessed with the Moomin books as a child. My best friend and I in third grade wrote a book of ""poetic odes"" to the Moomins. ;)"

ArtistLounge,2y9vga,AGamerDraws,1 point,Sat Mar 7 22:30:01 2015 UTC,"If you're looking to move into a more realistic style I would definitely recommend studying texture and how different textures affect light.

ArtistLounge,2y97cq,Powersimon,1 point,Sat Mar 7 20:10:00 2015 UTC,Sure! It's definitely worth a look; I think the trickiest thing is the state of pressure sensitive styluses right now—I don't think any really have the same feel as the ones Wacom bundles with their tablets. iPad styluses just tend to feel a bit clunkier. But hopefully that will change!
ArtistLounge,2y97cq,Powersimon,1 point,Sat Mar 7 23:10:24 2015 UTC,"Good point!   I've got the Wacom Creative Stylus 2 over here (sad to see how that performed on their test D:) and while it feels pretty close to me, it's still different enough to feel a bit strange as you say. Getting this app seems like one hurdle out of the way, though. Fingers crossed for what they come up with in the future :D"

MakeupAddiction is a good place to look for references when rgd is having a slow day. I like to draw a picture or two from there if I'm just practicing.    I have also started doing quick sketches of my environment as a warm up.    I did some drawing in my sketchbook as well, which is usually a good indicator that I have been procrastinating. I'll have to get my camera in order to share them, so It'll probably be a couple of minutes before I get it done.    Here they are.    I drew this chair as well. It's not a comfortable chair but I like the way it looks."
ArtistLounge,2y8jhb,Powersimon,4,Sat Mar 7 14:23:38 2015 UTC,"Awesome to get a look at your manual, tedious, technologically lacking drawings! What pen do you use?  Also, good idea to look through MakeupAddiction!"
ArtistLounge,2y8jhb,AGamerDraws,3,Sat Mar 7 15:55:10 2015 UTC,"I mostly use a micron 01 pen for line work.  It's precise enough that I can use it for technical drawing when I need to. It's also a good fit for an A5 sketchpad.     I use a pilot markers for large cut surfaces, or fill. I tried to use edding, but the ink didn't take as well to my paper.    Fun fact about Sakura microns: If you rub it in with sunscreen you can remove all the print on the outside. (this includes the numbering on the cap)    I inadvertently discovered this last summer. It makes it really difficult to differentiate between the 02 and 03s. In the end I had to mark them with rings of black tape.   I have also discovered how to make manual drawing less tedious, just don't ever use a pencil. When you make a mistake with pens it's there for ever, no sense in fretting over it. It is very liberating. Erasers are the worst. Can't stand them.   I know it's hard to believe but pen and paper used to be my primary medium way back when. I guess it shows in my some of my digital drawings. These days I only use paper for sketches, and I can't honestly remember the last time I finished a drawing on paper."

Maybe prototype it in Photoshop? Feel free to disagree ;)"
ArtistLounge,2y7d44,igarashihoshiko,1 point,Sat Mar 7 08:14:13 2015 UTC,That's a good idea! I'll give it a try in Photoshop.

I can hardly believe that someone with a gallery would do anything even remotely that crazy. I'd demand all the prints at zero cost to you or else.  Normally I'd advise not burning bridges, especially with someone who has a gallery, but no one who does something that idiotic would be good to have in your circle. Everyone who sees one of those shitty quality prints is going to think that was all you. It will reflect on your reputation.  Wow. So not okay"
ArtistLounge,2y6pyb,kaisengaard,3,Sat Mar 7 03:18:02 2015 UTC,"It technically wasn't a gallery, I live in a shore town  thats got nice beaches. This guy owned a nice store by the beach in the richer  area and sold magazines and local art and stuff like that. As much as I would like to pretend it was a great opportunity for me, it was kinda just a cluttered gift shop. I sent my friends over there after all this to secretly see if he was selling my prints and they always said it was closed. Id be very surprised if it even will be open this summer. The whole experience just made me really insecure and nervous to ever go out of my way and try to display my work."
ArtistLounge,2y6pyb,AGamerDraws,3,Sat Mar 7 04:05:57 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about displaying your work, as you can see from the reactions here this was awful behaviour by them and not something any of us would expect.  If you want to protect yourself in the future I would recommend fully checking out a premises and meeting with all those who would be involved to see if you want to be associated with them and their look/brand, if possible see if you can talk with any previous artists who have worked with them to see if they will recommend them, and finally, but probably most importantly, cover yourself with some kind of contract either written by yourself or with them.  In my experience a gallery or similar will have a formal way of applying for you to display your work, this is actually really helpful for the artist as it shows exactly how they will care for your work and what they will do with it. If they do anything outside of that contract then you can complain. Alternatively if it isn't a gallery write up your own clauses that state what rights they have when holding your work, make sure they sign and date it, and then if anything happens that breaches your contract you can complain.  This may seem a little over the top, but it really protects both the artist and the gallery/establishment/organisers and makes sure everyone involved knows what will happen with the work and that it's all agreed to."
ArtistLounge,2y6pyb,AGamerDraws,1 point,Sat Mar 7 15:14:24 2015 UTC,"No I don't think that's over the top. Before he brought up the prints and when I was just asking for my orginals back, I said it was my fault too for not having writted something up first. I feel like it was really naive of me to give someone so much of my work without and legal backing, even commission wasn't written down. So I'm just as guilty.   In the summer this town is really small, and the locals all know eachother. So as much as I wanted to put the store on blast and tell everyone, I don't want it to negatively effect me either. So I just see it as a learning experience."

ArtistLounge,2y6pyb,dauthislady,6,Sat Mar 7 11:25:51 2015 UTC,"This is awful!   Not sure about other countries, but UK copyright law states that once you create something you own all the rights to it and the distribution rights so if someone doesn't have written permission to copy and distribute it then they can be taken to court. In the UK we have the small claims court for this purpose. Not sure if there is an equivalent in your area?"

I just never knew if I was over reacting because I tend to be sensitive about my art. Everyone I told to at the time said it would cost me more to sue him then its worth, and since I didn't pay to have my work copyrighted I don't really have any authority."
ArtistLounge,2y6pyb,jackjohnbrown,8,Fri Mar 6 23:49:14 2015 UTC,"What country are you in?  It doesn't cost anything to do small claims, you automatically own the copyright (there's no patenting/trademarking or anything for creative works) and usually they cave the moment you say the word ""court"" (trust me, i've dealt with stuff like this before). Maybe it's different in your country, but that's what it is for the UK.  You were NOT over reacting, this is appalling behaviour and frankly I would be highly unimpressed.  I would request that all the prints are delivered to yourself as he has no right to hold or sell them."
ArtistLounge,2y6pyb,kyleclements,6,Fri Mar 6 23:55:23 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/AGamerDraws. This is copyright infringement. You are in no way over reacting. Send this guy a cease and desist letter ASAP, and take him to small claims. Just like the UK, in the US you automatically own the copyright to all tangible creative works you make, no need to file a trademark or patent. And small claims court will only cost you a small filing fee and your time.  By the way, this is my first post.

Art … brings the consumer … into a greater understanding of the world and a greater communion with their interior landscape and the people around them.   This is a poor definition. If this is your defense for action figures as high art, then they fail miserably. (In your defense, it is what one would expect from a student in a master degree program.) In fact, to use your own words, “That’s an attitude that some academics have … (to) make themselves indispensible in the interpretation and definition of art.”  Art is simply imbedding thought into material. That’s it. You or no one else gets to quantify it. The artist imbeds their thought into the material and each viewer responds to the medium via their own faculties.   I think you’re just confusing genres. Using the above definition (and again, being very generous) one could very well categorize action figures as pop art. If you love that genre then that’s great! Just don’t confuse genres; it’s not fair to any of the artists in their respective genres."

ArtistLounge,2y01uo,but_not_by_wolves,2,Thu Mar 5 15:47:39 2015 UTC,"Thankyou for such a detailed response,  that makes me feel a lot better about being pretty slow myself! I think I work in a similar way,  although I haven't attempted anything this detailed yet!"
ArtistLounge,2y01uo,but_not_by_wolves,2,Thu Mar 5 20:16:51 2015 UTC,"For me, the detailed drawings are more forgiving. There's so much going, it makes covering or hiding mistakes a little easier. Pieces with less detail are actually more difficult for me. I envy people who can do minimalism or even pieces with fewer details. I think it's the restraint of the artist that I respect.  Anyway, I chose this one because of the amount of detail. I knew it would be a damn fine challenge and would push me. It was worth it. Go find something that would not normally see yourself drawing and go for it. You might surprise yourself."
ArtistLounge,2y01uo,but_not_by_wolves,1 point,Thu Mar 5 22:30:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah I guess I agree with the minimalism thing..  I find it very difficult to simplify,  and I know I'm trying to use charcoal as if it was graphite, which just causes headaches!"
ArtistLounge,2y01uo,FaeLLe,2,Fri Mar 6 07:21:51 2015 UTC,"That is why I try to reserve charcoal for pieces that are truly less detailed. I know this one seems detailed, but it really isn't. There's a lot of work in this piece, but it really is just a bunch of lines or large, shaded areas. There are just a few truly detailed areas, like the eyes and lips. Hair is a bunch of lines, with some blending, and the fur is the same.   Also, the size if the drawing plays a big part. The larger the drawing is, the easier it is to work with...at least for me, it makes it easier."
ArtistLounge,2y01uo,FaeLLe,1 point,Fri Mar 6 08:49:54 2015 UTC,"That makes sense..  I'm still only working pretty small,  mostly A4 size, which doesn't help. I still think all those lines counts as detailed (or maybe I'm just being lazy!).."
ArtistLounge,2xxx34,westopher718,5,Wed Mar 4 20:01:46 2015 UTC,"I love the thumbnail!   The full image is blurry in a way that just doesn't read well for me. I know it's a study, great job with the colors and illumination/shadow."
ArtistLounge,2xxx34,yersiniaD,3,Wed Mar 4 22:56:41 2015 UTC,"That looks really good, makes me want to do some painting later.."
ArtistLounge,2xxx34,CracklesCousin,2,Wed Mar 4 20:40:27 2015 UTC,Thank you! And you should!
ArtistLounge,2xxx34,drawinglearner,3,Wed Mar 4 20:44:54 2015 UTC,"This is so great. I find it very difficult to paint materials which are both reflective and transparent, especially the way environmental lights and nearby objects interacting with it. You nailed it brilliantly here."
ArtistLounge,2xxx34,BrickWiggles,1 point,Wed Mar 4 23:20:02 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Trying to paint those types of materials (especially glass) has always been an intriguing challenge. I mean, really, how do you get plain old pigments and colors to look like a translucent material?? I'm still not entirely sure I understand it haha!"
ArtistLounge,2xxx34,defdac,3,Thu Mar 5 18:12:38 2015 UTC,I thought it was a photo in the thumbnail. Right on!
ArtistLounge,2xxx34,defdac,2,Thu Mar 5 02:37:27 2015 UTC,"Really nice, and good practice!   Weird fact: Having made a physically based and spectrally based global illumination renderer with BRDFs and BSDFs gives you as an artist a weird fundamental understanding of how light interacts with materials.   I found someone actually going through some of the aspects I am referring to."
ArtistLounge,2xxx34,Scientologist2a,2,Thu Mar 5 07:27:54 2015 UTC,"Holy crap, that was a really detailed video! Super interesting, the combination of physical science and art. Thanks for sharing!"
ArtistLounge,2xxx34,ItWillBeMine,1 point,Thu Mar 5 18:31:33 2015 UTC,"Cool you liked it. I actually learned something I hadn't thought of before from the video: That metals gives colored highlights. The tonemapper i digital cameras/raw-converters always blow them out to white, which I know I tend to mimic when painting myself. Will stop doing that. :) When I think about it I guess that is a giveaway that photos have been used as reference for a (non digital) painting."
ArtistLounge,2xyy14,TheJaunt,2,Thu Mar 5 01:02:17 2015 UTC,"Hey everybody. I just kind of sped this link in last night without saying much about it.   I think this looks like a neat challenge and will be participating in it starting today.  I have seen that people are using #21days when posting to Twitter and Facebook and whatnot. So, that's a good way to mark your work and see how other people are doing as well.  I will be posting here each day as well as all those other social places I am a part of.  If you want to jump on then feel free and I will be on the lookout for your work as well."
ArtistLounge,2xyy14,Powersimon,4,Thu Mar 5 11:01:11 2015 UTC,"I really believe in the power of daily drawing, be it #21days, #draw365, sketchDaily or whatever other framework/rules you work with :)  I saw it pop up all over facebook as well this morning.  Hope that this gets a lot people going and into the habit and I'm excited to see the progress you guys are gonna make :D"
ArtistLounge,2xyy14,186394,2,Thu Mar 5 12:52:47 2015 UTC,"I think that what is good about hos article as well is about getting back down to basics even if you're advanced or have been doing it for years. It was refreshing to read about Noah Bradley lamenting hos inability to practice every day.  My wife tells me that this concept is called the ""beginner's mind"" in yoga. It's about getting back to your basic movements. It does a number of things like help you focus on form, remind you of what a beginner might be going through and helping you drop any ego about how advanced you are.  Of course, it helps to bolster all your basic skills as well."
ArtistLounge,2xyy14,Akeleie,1 point,Thu Mar 5 17:47:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I hope this goes really well for a lot of people as well. Sometimes it takes a big name to get people going. Also, I do like the enthusiasm of his article as well.  Some people may drop out but this should be really fun.  Thanks for looking forward to our forthcoming work."
ArtistLounge,2xx6nq,megpadgett,5,Wed Mar 4 16:43:27 2015 UTC,"Keep small inexpensive prints in the front, clearly marked price tags. If someone likes your art and can buy it small scale affordable and easily, they will. Make sure to put your contact info on the back. Most of my larger prints I've sold to someone who owned my smaller prints till they could afford bigger. Just a suggestion."
ArtistLounge,2xx6nq,Dmunman,2,Wed Mar 4 17:58:54 2015 UTC,"there is no easy answer for this.  You have to factor in the gallery, the average price point of works that they deal in, their typical clientele, the marketability of your own work vs. you time/materials/logistical costs, etc..."
ArtistLounge,2xx6nq,vholecek,1 point,Wed Mar 4 17:28:39 2015 UTC,Of course not... I just was curious about the first time experiences of other artists.
ArtistLounge,2xwo5c,AGamerDraws,4,Wed Mar 4 14:09:48 2015 UTC,"This is a gigantic topic! The contract and terms are hugely important. Are there exclusivity or representation terms? Is it more low key and chill? What kind of gallery is it, what art do they show, shipping, commissions, insurance (if any), framing, so many questions!!  You know what we should do. Monday! Artist Lounge podcast topic! I think I could have some insight on this after I run you through an intense gauntlet of questions. :)"
ArtistLounge,2xwo5c,funisher,4,Wed Mar 4 15:52:32 2015 UTC,"This is honestly a topic which a lot of artists are woefully ill-prepared.  I think a podcast would be at least somewhat beneficial, even if to no one else but the artists that subscribe here.  I second this idea.  Also, I've got a thread on artist contracts stickied over at /r/artstore as a helpful resource for the artists that are subbed over there, it might be worth cross-linking as it could be easily adapted for these sorts of circumstances."
ArtistLounge,2xwo5c,vholecek,1 point,Wed Mar 4 16:08:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this will definitely be a good one. Its also interesting too because there are so many different avenues into showing art. My own experience can be pretty drastically different than my friends. Whether it be looking for representation, meeting people at openings, grants, college, building your own space, etc. This is gonna be a fun topic!"
ArtistLounge,2xwo5c,funisher,2,Wed Mar 4 16:30:47 2015 UTC,"Haha yes, perfect podcast topic. =]  It's going to be a big show on UK illustrators, i'm going to have a section of wall and a plinth and am allowed to show anything I want as long as it fits on that space. The only payment is the initial space cost, they don't take any commission charges or anything, I have my own insurance for covering artwork. It won't be in a classic gallery, they are opening up a London building to exhibit the installation in. Haven't seen any rules on framing or shipping, it seems to be more of a sort it out yourself thing. Topics on display will be illustration and street art, but they are marketing it as a high end show that will showcase big names and up and coming artists."
ArtistLounge,2xwo5c,funisher,2,Wed Mar 4 16:10:29 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you gotta make your space pop then! This is gonna be a fun topic. :)  Straight forward diy shows like this can be fun to do. You have to really rely on generating your own buzz specifically for your work. More than likely, assuming they can get a crowd to the show, its all on you to stand out. How much wall space are you looking at?"
ArtistLounge,2xwo5c,kaisengaard,1 point,Wed Mar 4 16:27:29 2015 UTC,"2400mm x 2400mm  I know they'll be having live artists and live musicians, and the venue is marketed to be very high end, I just need to figure out how I make myself stand out. I'll have a brand new collection for the show which i'm designing at the moment so it's a lot of freedom (which makes me excited yet nervous haha!)"

ArtistLounge,2xqi4t,funisher,4,Tue Mar 3 01:22:11 2015 UTC,Please devote more time to the geology segments.  My fossil from the vicinity of the Lake Bonneville site.
ArtistLounge,2xqi4t,MeatyElbow,3,Tue Mar 3 18:42:14 2015 UTC,I found /u/funisher's discussion of plate tectonics (namely a rudimentary explanation of divergent zones) rather lacking for what I expect in a 4 hour plus vodcast.  Quite disappointing pip pip.  I'll have to give that scallywag a what-for before the fortnight is through cheerio!
ArtistLounge,2xqi4t,kaisengaard,2,Tue Mar 3 19:36:12 2015 UTC,"Whoa, nice! I want to know more about that fossil!"
ArtistLounge,2xqi4t,MeatyElbow,2,Tue Mar 3 19:35:04 2015 UTC,"Ok.  I was helping a buddy build some stage props in a barn.  When we started moving the completed props to a trailer so they could be transported, I noticed a rock in the driveway with a funny pattern.  My initial thought was that it had been run over by a lawn mower or something because the pattern didn't really look like something you'd naturally see.    I picked up the rock, spit on it (wet stones tend to show colors better) and said, ""Hey look - a fossil.""    The Bureau of Land Management will let you keep any fossilized invertebrate found on BLM land.  This happened to be on private property so I could've kept it even had it been a complete archaeopteryx.  I put it in my pocket and it eventually found its way to my desk, where I keep a handful of interesting rocks.  This part of the world actually is pretty interesting.  You mentioned in the podcast that, growing up, the nearest city was a 400 mile drive.  That's about the same for me currently.  If I drive about an hour in any direction, I can get to some truly isolated areas.  I might see things that no one has looked at since driving a wagon train out to Oregon.. or since hunting bison 10,000 years before that (I've found some jasper that certainly looks like it's been knapped at some point).  I did that several times last summer - my wife and I would load up some gear, a picnic lunch, and go rock hunting.  Dry river beds (or mostly dry) tend to work pretty well.  Some of the places we went were probably washed out when Lake Bonneville broke its dam and made its way to the Pacific.  Some of them were lava tubes that were older than that.  I think that's part of the appeal for me - the immense, daunting scale of it.  Say that fossil is an ammonite (my amateur identification).  Those things died out 66 million years ago.  This one in particular had to die in just the right circumstances to leave a fossil behind.  That fossil had to go through whatever bizarre set of circumstances result in a particular stone ending up in my buddy's drive way.  I had to agree to helping him out on a particular Saturday morning and had to look down at a particular moment and notice a kind of unusual looking pattern.  Pretty long odds that any of that would happen the way it did.  Butterfly effect type stuff... maybe Drake Equation type stuff.  Turns out the BLM will let anyone tote off up to 50lbs of rocks per day if you want.  I've got a big pile of agates and jasper in my garage.  No good reason, really - just a hobby."
ArtistLounge,2xqi4t,MeatyElbow,2,Tue Mar 3 21:45:45 2015 UTC,"That's awesome man. Its so crazy to try to put 60 million years in context. Modern humans walked with cro-magnon man what, like 40,000 years ago? 60 million! Mountains have rolled. Ancient lakes the size of states have dried up. I still can't get over driving through mountain ranges and seeing the water lines on them. I seriously want to see more of the interesting rocks you've found out there."
ArtistLounge,2xqi4t,AGamerDraws,1 point,Wed Mar 4 01:52:23 2015 UTC,These are the ones on my desk - I think only the one in the center isn't local.  I'll bet I could fill a 5 gallon bucket with the ones sitting in my garage.

We trade off.  Also, thinking about mounting a drawing board to the wall near where i'm looking after the sleeping baby and draw with graphite or pastel. I got oil paint on the baby once and the wife found it soooooo no more studio baby!"
ArtistLounge,2xqyh3,MEGACLOPS,1 point,Tue Mar 3 03:59:22 2015 UTC,"That is a very tricky question. I stay up WAY too late drawing, which means sacrificing sleep. It gets easier to steal time, though; my youngest is now four, and I have so much more free time than before. My kids will often play for a half hour at a time and I can sneak in some drawing time. Painting is almost impossible, since it requires more of a time commitment and is hard to walk away from (especially acrylics, because they dry so fast!)  At some point, hopefully your kids will want to draw with you, which makes it feel less negligent. ;)  Space wise, I just have a bin and have to spread out temporarily wherever there's a semi-quiet spot. It's challenging, but I keep reminding myself that this is such a short period of our lives, in the grand scheme of things, and they're so much fun (despite the exhaustion) when they're little."
ArtistLounge,2xqyh3,k0nundrum,1 point,Tue Mar 3 04:09:15 2015 UTC,"I always like getting up early. I would practice before everything breaks loose, I'm fresh and it quiet."

Of course priorities are wife, kids, and job, but when my kids were that young I still carried a sketchbook. Thumbnails, quick still life (e.g. baby bottles?), gesture drawings or just zoning out on doodles. As soon as the kids were old enough to color I moved the drawing table out into the living room and purchased a little plastic one for the kids. We set them together and the kids and I watercolored and drew together. Good luck."
ArtistLounge,2xqyh3,TheJaunt,1 point,Tue Mar 3 15:14:34 2015 UTC,Quick solution is you can get yourself a piece of wood. 1/2 to 1 inch should work. Get a couple of binder clips and go to town.   Granted this won't help you concentrate but it's a place to start to draw.
ArtistLounge,2xqyh3,jackjohnbrown,1 point,Thu Mar 5 01:01:40 2015 UTC,My wife and I have 16 month old twins. I've also got a 40 hr/wk day job and I write a weekly film column. I'd say 95% of my drawing happens between 11pm and 3am.   Fortunately I've never been much of a sleeper.

ArtistLounge,2xn3xy,ObeyMyBrain,2,Mon Mar 2 08:38:56 2015 UTC,"The only brand I've used is Winsor & Newton. It was some paints I had from a college class and just stuck with the brand since I've read that quality varies quite a bit with gouache. Some of the ""student"" quality paints don't behave like their high quality counterparts."
ArtistLounge,2xn3xy,MacAnthony,1 point,Mon Mar 2 21:19:35 2015 UTC,"I'll check those out, I've always liked their oil paints and inks."
ArtistLounge,2xn3xy,etchasketches,2,Tue Mar 3 00:51:00 2015 UTC,"I've only tried a few, and mainly use it for highlights and finishing details on my graphite drawings.  That said, I've tried out a few brands and Holbein's Gouache is the best so far."
ArtistLounge,2xkmx4,ukraine_not_weak,2,Sun Mar 1 16:51:01 2015 UTC,"Hey guys, I just finished inking the above pinup piece -- I'd like to color, but am a bit torn as to which direction I want to take it. Fellow artists, my ideas (which you can feel free to add to or critique):   duotone -- red highlights (for example the blood stains on Elise) with grey shading/tones here and there, but largely keep it as is a pure red/crimson wash or gradient or watercolor layer -- so basically the whole thing will be red and black   I dunno, it just doesn't seem appropriate to do a standard colorization since... I dunno, doesn't seem like it would be a fitting tribute to the surrealism of the show. The only thing I know for certain is I'll add some grey-scale to the 'iris' part of the mural, since as-is... well, it doesn't reflect the muralist's design ;)  SO! Advice is welcome!"
ArtistLounge,2xkmx4,imustbedelusional,2,Sun Mar 1 16:51:10 2015 UTC,Amazing composition!
ArtistLounge,2xkmx4,katfriday,2,Mon Mar 2 12:59:26 2015 UTC,"Wow, I think it's gorgeous! The inking is really well done and I love the circle of people in the middle. Got that nice sinister vibe going on...  Color-wise, keep it very simple? Quite honestly, I really like the artwork as is, but I could see crimson gradient and/or that duotone of red highlights your mentioned. I'd keep it really blunt and raw. Just make sure to show us the final result!"
ArtistLounge,2xlcao,ItWillBeMine,5,Sun Mar 1 20:18:46 2015 UTC,"I'll start!   At the risk of being very predictable, I'm going with my third historical portrait with a dark background this week. I wasn't aware that I was so drawn to that style until we started doing these posts. In any event, my choice this week is Portrait of a Man in a Red Turban by Jan van Eyck. This is from 1433.   Why do I love it?   I'm always fascinated by the historical portraits that are timeless, meaning that the person looks as though they could be alive today. Bonus points (to me) that this is done on wood rather than canvas  Like the Botticelli piece I chose a couple of weeks ago, the attractiveness of the subject helped me in making my decision. And no, I don't mean that this guy is ""hot,"" but rather I mean that there is an alertness and shrewdness in the gaze that I find captivating. He reminds me vaguely of Tywin Lannister, actually.   Aside from these things, there is the very obvious ability and advanced technique in the folds of the skin, the contouring, the lighting, etc. And apparently I love a bleak background. It makes you give all of your attention to the subject at hand. :) See you next week!"
ArtistLounge,2xlcao,funisher,2,Sun Mar 1 20:27:02 2015 UTC,That man was an ultimate tempera badass! Here's a video about how to make egg tempera paint. :)
ArtistLounge,2xlcao,sgt_mary_mary,0,Mon Mar 2 16:39:58 2015 UTC,I want a headpiece like that.

ArtistLounge,2xlcao,FoxtrotOscar23,5,Mon Mar 2 03:25:29 2015 UTC,"These ball-point pen drawings by Shohei Otomo, Katsuhiro Otomo's (Akira Man) son.  I like them because he's working in a very specific medium and doing something completely different to his (ridiculously awesome) father."
ArtistLounge,2xlcao,kaisengaard,1 point,Sun Mar 1 23:23:34 2015 UTC,Amazing. I would never have guessed that was pen. :O
ArtistLounge,2xlcao,sgt_mary_mary,3,Mon Mar 2 03:25:49 2015 UTC,Oh god yes. I love everything she does.
ArtistLounge,2xlcao,sgt_mary_mary,2,Mon Mar 2 04:45:53 2015 UTC,Loish does awesome work :)
ArtistLounge,2xlcao,Dmunman,4,Mon Mar 2 12:40:13 2015 UTC,"Mariana by John Everett Millais, 1851.  This is my favourite painting by Millais. It's inspired by poem by the same name, that can be read here.  There's much to be said about this piece. The level of detail is almost overwhelming, and I find something new everytime I look at it. The leaves strewn across the room is an obvious feature that stands out.  What I love most about it is all the emotion that's communicated by the woman's pose. You can practically feel the boredom, and how sore her back is from sitting and staring out  the window for so long. It's an unusual pose/scene to depict, I think, which makes it so much more compelling.   Lastly, the use of light is wonderful. Especially on her face, and in the fabric of her dress."
ArtistLounge,2xjm1x,zeruch,1 point,Sun Mar 1 07:47:43 2015 UTC,"Zeruch, your work is hurting my brain trying to think about your process. Love it! The intricacy of it and yet it's grungy feel. Incredible vibe, I read the description of the mediums used and scratch my head trying to envision the creative process and I find myself baffled and mystified. Please keep sharing your incredible work!"
ArtistLounge,2xj7lr,GyroWizard,3,Sun Mar 1 04:46:41 2015 UTC,"I found a lot of mine on deviant art. I like oils, splatters(not too many uses but when you need it), hair/fur, smoke"
ArtistLounge,2xgsez,robot_or_rowboat,5,Sat Feb 28 15:23:29 2015 UTC,"Something dynamic, since this isn't a life modeling session and you don't have to stay that way for an extended period. Or something emotional, something where strain and stresses can be seen in your body, face. Something that offers a good silhouette. Something that reads well from a distance. Decent lighting, as I remember your rgd photo had a sort of washed out look to it. Maybe pop into a life modeling class and note their 5 to 10 second poses? I find those tend to offer that most visually exciting poses. Get a lamp, a shitty one, close your window, light yourself from one direction, use your body to cast shadows on itself. Just my two cents!"
ArtistLounge,2xgsez,doesordies,3,Sat Feb 28 18:08:29 2015 UTC,"Excellent advice all-around. The lighting seems like the most important aspect so I'll try out different things there, in what way should the lamp be shitty?  Also, I wish I knew of any modeling classes nearby so I could get an example but it seems like that's not the case. Thank you for everything."
ArtistLounge,2xgsez,doesordies,5,Sat Feb 28 18:40:05 2015 UTC,"Oh I just threw that in there, what I mean is don't worry about getting a fancy lamp or anything. Just a lamp, a light source that you can control and play with."
ArtistLounge,2xgsez,Synespire,3,Sat Feb 28 20:10:16 2015 UTC,"Figure model here. Everyone has their own style of posing, I like to accentuate my neck (like a slight tilt of head, for example) since it's a prominent feature of my body. Often I pose with a prop, so the artist's skills grow from drawing my hands.  Print out a list of verbs, and then pose what the verb is describing."
ArtistLounge,2xgsez,Synespire,1 point,Sat Feb 28 23:10:57 2015 UTC,"I'll have to give the list of verbs a shot, that sounds interesting. I'd also love to hear what props you have used, thank you for all of that."
ArtistLounge,2xgsez,not_safe_for_worf,2,Sat Feb 28 23:16:10 2015 UTC,"I have posed with a post, a plastic sword, a globe, a pumpkin, and an orange, and other random shit. Have fun!"
ArtistLounge,2xgsez,bigAlittleA,3,Sat Feb 28 23:19:53 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with doing something ""dynamic"" or weird-- I think very few artists can even get a grasp on how people shift around and land naturally, let alone contorted or jumping around. Its more impressive when an artist captures the soul of a thing in their art without all the razzle dazzle.   I always know when its a beginner model at a figure drawing session because they pose in these ridiculous unnatural ways. Trying too hard. This is also the problem with some pictures from those timed-session artist web apps.  Personally I think you should keep the poses loose and natural, and then maybe focus on something like trying to get a unique camera angle, or telling a story with a series of pictures."
ArtistLounge,2xgsez,tocilog,2,Sun Mar 1 03:09:05 2015 UTC,"Look for books of classical figure drawing. The poses are usual simple, but show the rhythm of the figure. Look up the term contraposto for an example."
ArtistLounge,2xgsez,TotallyNotDumb,2,Sat Feb 28 21:15:31 2015 UTC,If it's going to be a photograph then lighting and shadows.  It's interesting to see and draw the subtle curves of the body.
ArtistLounge,2xgsez,thyrza,2,Sun Mar 1 04:04:30 2015 UTC,For one thing I remember having a model that would stare you down if you focused on their eyes or face in general. Other models never seemed to do that. I personally found it distracting.
ArtistLounge,2xgsez,orvane,-8,Sun Mar 1 04:30:16 2015 UTC,"If you are male, I think it would be more polite to not do full frontal nudity."
ArtistLounge,2xgsez,thyrza,3,Sat Feb 28 18:19:29 2015 UTC,I do not agree. Being polite is not an issue here. The male full frontal nude body is not offensive nor disgusting by default. As far as there is no offensive act or suggestion from the pose itself. Art students draw or paint full frontal nude male models all the time. Many artworks throughout art history feature male frontal nudity. For example Statue of David.
ArtistLounge,2xgsez,thyrza,3,Sun Mar 1 01:26:18 2015 UTC,"Good to see support in favor of full nudity here as well, it would be interesting to know everyone's opinion on this."
ArtistLounge,2xgsez,orvane,6,Sun Mar 1 01:45:25 2015 UTC,"thyrza is in the clear minority, I can assure you.  Any artist that feels like they've got some more to learn will more often than not jump at the chance of full nude shots, female or male.  There's only one way to understand anatomy and that is practice - the more avenues we have available to us to do this, the better!   Disregard their remark, there's nothing impolite about offering nude poses for art, and I thank you for doing so."
ArtistLounge,2xgsez,thyrza,1 point,Sun Mar 1 10:38:44 2015 UTC,"Great to know, thank you so much!"
ArtistLounge,2xgp1x,rainwatersoup,2,Sat Feb 28 14:45:58 2015 UTC,"It's ok to be interested in and work in different media. But, I would pick your strongest communicator (medium) for an exhibit. What I mean is – choose the medium that people react to or comment on the most (e.g. ""I dig your sculptures, but your paintings are amazing and really talk to me.""). Always play your strong cards.  Nothing looks more amateur (or like a high school art exhibit) as work that is all over the map. Imagine yourself in the gallery space with all your work on the walls and you are welcoming guests. You want them to know you have something to say, a good command of the visual vocabulary to say it with, and most of all appear highly professional and artistically competent. This helps people feel more comfortable about getting out their checkbooks."
ArtistLounge,2xgp1x,crowber,1 point,Sat Feb 28 16:48:44 2015 UTC,"Nothing looks more amateur (or like a high school art exhibit) as work that is all over the map.   exactly what im afraid of. do you have any suggestions on how to develop that cohesiveness?   im thinking of ""consolidating"" the process and medium itself than compromise the subject. e.g. convey the message/create the work through screenprinting or blockprinting than keep on creating art that talks about the same thing. do you think that would be positive?"
ArtistLounge,2xgp1x,marieoftroy,2,Sun Mar 1 03:03:50 2015 UTC,"I suggest writing an art statement. You may subconsciously or inherently know why you make art, but writing it down makes you formalize it and helps you explain it to others (and to yourself.) Prominently display this art statement at each exhibit to explain to non-art people why you take time to make art and display it. You can't stand by each piece and explain it to everyone, so your art statement does that succinctly and in plain language. (Avoid ""art talk"" and snotty art vocabulary. Short and sweet, open up and plainly explain yourself and your art to people.)  For example, I have 3-4 different subjects (or series) for which I create oil paintings. Even though they differ in subject matter, they fall under the theme of my total body of work (as outlined in my art statement.) If they were all in the same exhibit, they would have an obvious thread that runs through them all. This creates a brand and demonstrates a unified goal in my work. This shows the viewer that I'm not just out painting pretty things on a whim but that I have put considerable thought into my body of work and that I have something to say."
