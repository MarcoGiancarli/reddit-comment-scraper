delusionalartists,3dzivh,mfranko88,7,Tue Jul 21 02:13:54 2015 UTC,That's kind of chump change when you get into bigger settings/compositions.

delusionalartists,3dzivh,Spiderdan,21,Tue Jul 21 08:20:39 2015 UTC,"There's a section where he switches from like 4/4 to 2/4 back to 4/4 back to 2/4 then to 3/8 then to 5/4 then back to something else.  It's just all so intentionally, annoyingly, trying to be difficult to give the impression of being too good for you.  I understand a lot of contemporary stuff is like this, and 5/4 isn't such a rare time signature anymore, but this is all done so intentionally it makes me angry.    Like, ""You know what will really show how smart I am?  Let me switch the time signature a BUNCH of times really fast and then go to 5/4 because that's uncommon and makes me look so smart.  Let me just squeeze in as many time signature changes as I can actually.""  Edit: just took a closer look at those time signatures.  Jesus christ.  2/8 and 5/8 time signatures...  Edit 2:  Admittedly it's been a while since I've played music but someone needs to explain this to me.  He has a section of 3 measures going from 5/8 to 2/8 then to 4/4.  Why didn't he just make it 7/8 to 4/4?  Edit 3:  My eyes might be broken, but is that 15/16???  Edit 4:  He has a measure of 5/16.  I'm done after that one.  I imagine this is what would happen if you wrote a bunch of notes that you think sounds good and then went back and try to add time signatures after the fact.  It's a mess.  Edit 5:  Fuck me.  it's 5/16 to 3/16 to 5/16.  I want to punch him in the throat."
delusionalartists,3dzivh,WIENERPUNCH,9,Tue Jul 21 07:40:06 2015 UTC,"Yep that was basically my take on it, too. The thing doesn't sound horrible a lot of the time, but all of the unnecessary changes in signature only serve the purpose of creating the illusion of complexity. That 5/16 to 3/16 and back... Why not one measure of 13/16? Why not approximate it with a single measure of 7/8 with less unreasonable timing? Because that one sixteenth not doesn't fucking matter that much.

delusionalartists,3dzivh,ChokeZero,8,Tue Jul 21 02:49:50 2015 UTC,"Playing with fire here trying to provide another opinion, and I'm by no means an expert, but as an avid classical music fan and classical musician, I'd say it's really not awful. Unfortunately, he does seem to be biting off a bit more than he can chew by jumping straight into symphonic poems after an online course on theory, but I think the general themes are musically interesting if not somewhat rudimentary. I personally think he has room to grow, and part of that growth is putting aside that ego of his and actually taking the time and effort involved to really learn not only from just criticism, but also from an actual teacher. I'd cut the hot-head a little slack. Writing even a cadenza (relatively short part of a solo where the player plays around a bit with the themes and melodies of the piece to kind of ""show off"" their skills) can be really difficult without the proper training. Trying to write major orchestral works with only an online course is like trying to design a rocket with only the experience of a high school physics class."

delusionalartists,3dzivh,Spiderdan,11,Mon Jul 20 23:12:42 2015 UTC,"OP, jesus christ.  I made a comment further down as I go through this song and it's baffling me.  I'll say flat out I'm not musical genius, but I've played for years.  This shit is so over the top trying to look smart it's blowing my mind.    If you have a basic understanding of how time signatures work, and which are common in music, try watching the song and following along.  Now contemporary music is often strange and will have odd time signatures and time changes, but following this is near impossible for me.  And there's no reason for some of these time signature changes.    It's as if he started putting notes on a page in this program without thinking, decided he wanted it to sound a certain way, and constantly changed the time signature in order for the notes to fit better.  I just... please someone else look at this train-wreck.  He actually has a 15/16 time signature.  For 1 measure.  This whole thing is so contrived I'm actually angry."
delusionalartists,3dzivh,ediblesprysky,3,Tue Jul 21 08:10:28 2015 UTC,"Okay, everyone's really pissed about the time signatures. I'm not saying this guy's any good (he's not), but honestly, I specialize in contemporary music--it was all I did for two years. And I'm grateful, because learning to read changing time signatures like this made me trust my internal pulse implicitly. When done correctly, time signature switches like this are meant to make complex rhythms easier to read by grouping them in a coherent way.    It's as if he... decided he wanted it to sound a certain way, and constantly changed the time signature in order for the notes to fit better.   Yep. That's exactly what they do in contemporary music. Again, this kid clearly isn't getting the training he needs to do it well (a few weeks of an online course... yeah), but it CAN be logical. And yeah, it's hard to sight read, but once you spend some time with it and figure it out, it makes INFINITELY more sense than trying to smash everything into 4/4 would. I would so much rather read bars of 5/8 and 5/16 (because at least those communicate where emphasis and phrasing should be placed) than try to put those agogic accents in the right place in a bar of 4/4 or 2/4.   Of course, even actual composers sometimes just do it to look real smart, because that's how you win competitions. Nobody hears your music in those things, because often, only brand-spankin-new, unperformed pieces are eligible to win. So the panel just flips through the scores, decides which they like at first glance, and then make awards accordingly.   So anyway. Everybody, please stop complaining about the time signatures. That's just new music, and it's a blessing to your performers if you do it right. That said, this kid is clearly delusional, yes. But there's nothing inherently wrong with 5/16 or 15/16."

The piece itself is meant to be dissonant, and I can't hear him playing many wrong notes. However, when playing piano music on an organ, it usually becomes much more dissonant.  Ironically, Scriabin was the king of crazy, deluded composers. He was a genius, but extremely arrogant, he said ""I m God"", thought to be the 2nd coming of Jesus, and designed a musical ""event"" (with hs music and flying bells by the Himalayas) that would cause the Apocalypse, from which mankind would emerge as superior beings.  (the bookish explanation for the piece sounding so awful on an organ is that it unusually has many chords with added sevenths, ninths and thirteenths that when doubled in several octaves as organs do, produce 3 or 4-note clusters that ""muddle"" the harmonies)."

Edit: Having watched a few of this guy's videos (and assuming his label as organ virtuoso is accurate), I do not find him consistently pretentious, simply because he is so clearly genuine in his work ethic and dedication to his craft. This video, however, I do find pretentious, because I think he overreaches a bit in his attempt to be seen as a sex/pop idol, despite the fact that he plays classical organ and gets shoutouts from what looks like his mom.

delusionalartists,3dwd4h,BazookaSquirrel,-3,Mon Jul 20 03:41:23 2015 UTC,"what is a ""technical organ pedal?"" I think perhaps you don't understand the different ways in which the pedals work on a piano and organ, respectively?  the issue is not with the functionality of either, but the function of the parts of each. the pedals of a piano are used in conjunction with the keys to alter the sound of each individual voice - that relationship is incredibly complex. the revolutionary thing about the piano as a keyboard instrument was the fact that it gave the player instantaneous command of the dynamics of every sound that came out of the instrument. the function of organ pedals is to produce notes independent of those produced by the manuals - nuance is not imparted in either by their combined use pertaining to one voice, no by velocity (which are moment-to-moment considerations playing the piano), as an organ's dynamics are not controlled by how hard you play the manuals/pedals, but by the settings you have made prior to playing a given note.   there are WAY MORE organ pedals, but, outside of adjusting their settings, they have WAY LESS variety of expression. They're another keyboard, to be played with your feet. It is always exciting to see someone execute a passage on the pedals with a great virtuosity - but virtuosity of piano pedal technique is just as equally the domain of the master.  the piano and organ are two entirely different machines that happen to look similar in a lot of ways. it is easy to sit back and say one is somehow more difficult than another if you don't know what you're talking about. Neither is easy, but they aren't really comparable, as they work in two entirely different ways, require two totally different sets of skills, and two totally different bodies of knowledge."

delusionalartists,3d67og,FrenchLama,5,Wed Jul 15 16:38:54 2015 UTC,"Her name is Benni. She's actually a pretty awesome little girl. She was only 14 at the time and did the video as a fun favor for Rebecca Black. Due to poor editing choices and bad video production overall, she got caught in some unfortunate gifs like the one above. Benni went viral herself and became known as ""the girl in pink."" She was the victim of ridiculous amounts of cyber-bullying. People called her ugly, fat, sent sexual threats, etc. It was pretty out of hand. She was a kid.  But, she took it in stride and actually released her own song, ""Can You See Me Now?"", which isn't terrible. It tries to bring to light what  highschoolers struggle with and how badly bullying and such can affect them.  She speaks at a lot of anti-bullying events and is a pretty huge advocate for it. She's a very respectable person and it's kind of cool how resilient she was, especially at that age... it's hard enough being 14 and dancing awkwardly with braces, lol.

I think the little dog on the bottom right is cute. It's a kind of cartoony rendition, but that's what I like about it. For a true to life portrait of your dog, you're looking at a lot more. My SO has an aunt who paints dog portraits and charges around $100 for an original 10""x14""."

delusionalartists,3cjmij,Kingmudsy,3,Thu Jul 9 05:05:07 2015 UTC,"The appeal of being a furry? It's hard to explain.  When I was younger and full of hormones (and I'm sure you can understand), I was looking at all types of NSFW. I ran across yiff (our slang for our porn), and decided I liked it.  However it was strictly porn until I was about 18. I met my first girlfriend and it also turned out she was a furry. She was a beautiful redhead and she introduced me to the community. That's when I really got into the fandom.  A lot of people misunderstand us as a few things... They categorize us and it's not true.  1: Sexual deviant.. FURRIES LIKE BESTIALITY, AND SEX IN ANIMAL COSTUMES.  That's not true at all. There might be some (and I mean like 3%) that are interested in bestiality. Most of us are rational people. Sex in our fursuits? Those costs upwards of two thousand dollars to make. We either handcraft them with love and care or pay for someone else to. The people that have sex in them are a slim minority. It's like.. Imagine that you somehow have a $2000 pair of pajamas. You would take very good care of those pajamas right? Most of us take very good care of our fursuits.  2: FURRIES ARE JUST WEIRD!  I can understand this. As an example, I think people that get off on hentai are weird. I think people that are heavily into MTG and other TCG games are weird. However, that is because I have never tried to understand or see the appeal in TCG, or even tried them myself. I'm sure most of them are normal people, but there might be a few weird ones involved just like any other group of people.  On the outside, we appear to dress in animal costumes and like ""animal porn"". That probably shouts weird to everyone. However, did you ever notice how the media fucks everything over? Not all of us like yiff, and only a small % can even afford fursuits.  Being a furry is about finding an open, loving community. I have NEVER, and I'm 100% serious see two furries fight in our subreddit. Not a single argument. I've seen several posts about people explaining that they are sorry for thinking we were weird. They went to one of our conventions and ended up having a great time, and felt stupid for hating us.  We like drawing pictures of animal people and talking amongst ourselves, but we are kind and caring people. Sometimes, I feel these people are like family. I can ask for any advice or any help and lots of people are there to support you.  We all get a bad rep, but we are not sexual deviants, or weird. It may not be the most prominent thing in my life, but I will always be a fur until I die."
delusionalartists,3cjmij,Karbairusa,3,Thu Jul 9 05:17:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not a furry, but I see hundreds of artworks a day for the work I do. Some of the fandom's (are you guys even a fandom?) works are absolutely stunning. You guys have some master artists in your ranks.  But there's always more shit art out there than good art, and I would be lying if I said the majority is amazing.  I'm curious, is there like a furry art school or something?

delusionalartists,3cjmij,fishdiscovrwaterlast,8,Wed Jul 8 23:22:34 2015 UTC,This looks like it's a very young person. I would consider supporting her hobby for $7  though the drawings will probably not end up on my walls.
delusionalartists,3cjmij,weregoat,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:59:37 2015 UTC,Agreed.
delusionalartists,3cjmij,frenchiest_fry,5,Thu Jul 9 05:34:54 2015 UTC,"Sure the kid is trying to practice his or her craft, and sure $7 isn't a lot, but in my opinion it is a bit delusional to think that selling your beginner art earn you any extra cash. I hate drawing things for people for free just as much as the next person, but I never thought that any of my practice sketches that I did when I first started to seriously draw were good enough to sell. And tbh, all the artists I know who do sketches for sale are either not that great and are furries/do anime fanart, or charge just $2 or $3 for a caricature. Idk it just seems a bit delusional to me. It's good practice though, I give it to OP."
delusionalartists,3cjmij,swantonist,4,Sun Jul 12 05:59:29 2015 UTC,"that first drawing isn't too bad but he draws wolves in that ""furry"" style"
delusionalartists,3cjmij,fayettevillainjd,5,Sat Jul 18 17:36:08 2015 UTC,I will pay $3 extra if you burn it when you are done
delusionalartists,3cjmij,MetalPandaDance,3,Wed Jul 8 16:27:23 2015 UTC,Why do all furries draw in that disgusting style?
delusionalartists,3cjmij,t0mRiddl3,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:21:20 2015 UTC,so they can wank off to it I think...
delusionalartists,3cjmij,kaboose286,4,Wed Jul 8 20:11:27 2015 UTC,"this sub is taking a huge shit over all the subscribers. this isnt that delusional. $7 isnt that much to ask for so i would say it fits. not the best, sure. but not delusional."
delusionalartists,3cjmij,sizzletron,2,Wed Jul 8 23:04:33 2015 UTC,It's a good thing. There was this time where I bought a portrait to tack to my wall that was 10 dollars and when he was done he had charged me 4 dollars more for shading. I made him erase it because I only had 10 dollars and besides who just springs the surcharge like that without any warning?
delusionalartists,3cjmij,Agent_McMuffin,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:25:47 2015 UTC,I cringed a lil bit.
delusionalartists,3cjmij,philihp,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:49:28 2015 UTC,The pricing is modest so this doesn't belong here.
delusionalartists,3cjmij,whenuseeit,3,Thu Jul 9 02:18:39 2015 UTC,Traditional   TIL there is a culture out there that has a tradition of terrible drawings on unframed paper.
delusionalartists,3cjmij,Zernen,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:14:59 2015 UTC,"While they aren't going to be in a museum, the canines aren't awful. I think the price is spot on.  The artist is probably a kid just trying to make a little extra $$. They have some skills (because momma said they were good) so they thought they could profit a bit."
delusionalartists,3cjmij,Wooble_Gop,2,Wed Jul 8 16:14:54 2015 UTC,Not one like or comment.. :/
delusionalartists,3cjmij,An_undeniable_truth,-5,Wed Jul 8 16:31:50 2015 UTC,Yiff in hell.
delusionalartists,3cla2r,RedDeadGamer22,10,Wed Jul 8 20:04:51 2015 UTC,Cough Cough He's joking  Nice try tho Tyler
delusionalartists,3cla2r,AdviceDanimals,-12,Wed Jul 8 22:25:08 2015 UTC,...how do you know my name o.o
delusionalartists,3cfsjo,Another_Desk_Jockey,37,Tue Jul 7 16:01:02 2015 UTC,"""I have repurposed him."" That made me chortle."
delusionalartists,3cfsjo,kintsukuroisparrow,32,Wed Jul 8 04:45:44 2015 UTC,"""Pray I do not repurpose him any further."""
delusionalartists,3cfsjo,AlexJacksonPhillips,17,Wed Jul 8 04:58:26 2015 UTC,"""We can repurpose him. We have the technology."""
delusionalartists,3cfsjo,Wolfinite,43,Wed Jul 8 09:09:51 2015 UTC,I kinda like it actually
delusionalartists,3cfsjo,DanzoFriend,17,Wed Jul 8 00:29:13 2015 UTC,I do too...i think it photographs well tho...kinda looks like a painting in the pic and I think that helps a lot
delusionalartists,3cfsjo,catslothsexwithwife,12,Wed Jul 8 01:59:47 2015 UTC,Same here. There's something about it that I actually enjoy. Wouldn't put it in my living room but it's nice to look at.
delusionalartists,3cfsjo,SaineGray,-17,Wed Jul 8 01:05:44 2015 UTC,-insert 'your mom' joke here-
delusionalartists,3cfsjo,iamsam007,61,Wed Jul 8 03:01:50 2015 UTC,if this were a different colour I would probably like it as a really simple wall decor.   ....I'm not sure what you consider delusional about this.
delusionalartists,3cfsjo,Mquestionmark,47,Tue Jul 7 16:18:12 2015 UTC,"....I'm not sure what you consider delusional about this.   I'm still trying to figure that out, too. Not seeing any boasting or outlandish pricing or anything of that nature. It's just a repurposed 'found junk' piece. Lots of people do this. Unless they plan to ask $1,000 for this or they think they're created the new David, not sure how this qualifies."
delusionalartists,3cfsjo,CBFisaRapist,2,Wed Jul 8 01:28:38 2015 UTC,"It looks horrible, If I want told id have no idea what it was, and definitely less intention to buy it."
delusionalartists,3cfsjo,catfayce,33,Wed Jul 8 03:35:37 2015 UTC,"It looks horrible   This sub isn't r/badart, though, it's r/delusionalartists. As it says in the sidebar, ""Your post is about the artist, not the art.""  This is just junk repurposed into an oddball decoration. That's pretty commonplace; lots of people like that shit. I'm not seeing the part where the creator is delusional. The seller doesn't seem to be claiming it's a great work or art or asking an outlandish price or anything like that.  Maybe the creator is full of him/herself and believes this is some great and important piece of art, but if so, the submission sure doesn't show it."
delusionalartists,3cfsjo,CBFisaRapist,2,Wed Jul 8 04:05:00 2015 UTC,"You are right, I was drunk so just hated on it rather than followed the rules"
delusionalartists,3cfsjo,catfayce,-1,Wed Jul 8 11:01:38 2015 UTC,...You want that on your wall?
delusionalartists,3cfsjo,Dixnorkel,2,Wed Jul 8 12:36:16 2015 UTC,"if it were a different colour, sure, why not?"
delusionalartists,3cfsjo,Mquestionmark,22,Wed Jul 8 15:14:44 2015 UTC,"I can't even figure out what it is. I know it's supposed to be a buck without antlers, but I don't see it at all. What is this thing?"
delusionalartists,3cfsjo,poodlepaws,27,Tue Jul 7 16:59:19 2015 UTC,I think it's a spraypainted deer skull glued to a board.
delusionalartists,3cfsjo,razorbeamz,12,Tue Jul 7 17:17:50 2015 UTC,Ah I kinda see it now. Terribly ugly.
delusionalartists,3cfsjo,poodlepaws,6,Tue Jul 7 17:21:35 2015 UTC,"This could have worked out really nicely if ""shadows"" of his former antlers had been painted on the board and rhinestones hadn't been jammed up his nose."
delusionalartists,3cfsjo,NibbleFish,2,Wed Jul 8 02:29:36 2015 UTC,"I just made a similar comment, but since I have had this thread open long enough, I did not see it before I commented...may I say, you are spot on with what you thing ""should"" have gone on with this artwork, and that I agree..."
delusionalartists,3cfsjo,loller_skates,4,Wed Jul 8 08:52:30 2015 UTC,"It's not so bad, it's more the fact that it seems unnecessarily 9ft tall that makes the piece seemingly impractical."
delusionalartists,3cfsjo,HeeroToast,3,Wed Jul 8 02:51:21 2015 UTC,"It might be meant to be a mantlepiece kind of thing that you'd hang horizontally over something. I have a piece like that made from driftwood from a favorite beach, etched with the family name. A friend made it as a gift.  Though if that's the case, not sure how the skull would look turned on its side."
delusionalartists,3cfsjo,CBFisaRapist,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:24:53 2015 UTC,"this could have been cool if she had painted ""shadows"" of antlers..."
delusionalartists,3cfsjo,loller_skates,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:48:59 2015 UTC,"This could have been so full of win, honestly I clicked on it and my mind went to Shadowrun for the genesis. I got kinda excited, then cried."
delusionalartists,3cfsjo,girlheartsfett,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:53:52 2015 UTC,When he said it was 'a buck' I thought that was actually quite a reasonable price - then the penny dropped
delusionalartists,3cfsjo,JJKeys,-1,Thu Jul 9 16:32:57 2015 UTC,"a buck   Dude, that's a bird?"
