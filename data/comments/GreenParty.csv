GreenParty,3dm0ko,burtzev,3,Fri Jul 17 10:33:52 2015 UTC,"This is one of the biggest untapped, easily-accessible forms of renewable energy around. Forget Wales :), this is very applicable to the NE, NW and other parts of the US.  I'm always baffled at people paying large sums of money for solar installations (conspicuous consumption?) that generate power only during daylight, as they ignore the brook that flows through their property and could be generating much more power 24/7."
GreenParty,3dm0ko,plutonicraven,2,Fri Jul 17 11:35:03 2015 UTC,"Sadly, I don't blame them. Solar installations are all pretty much turn-key, with predictable installation costs and ROI. Small hydro is still more of a niche and every install is custom. You may not even be able to find someone local who knows how to set one up. Some people would sooner part with their money than learn anything."

A few failed bids at different offices at different levels and one or two offices of consequence.  Sanders wants the same things that greens want, he differs slightly at gun control. Except for the gun control there is virtually no difference between the two. A vote for Bernie (assuming he gets past Hillary and accepts the nomination) is a vote for the green party."

I was listening to Jill Stein's presidential bid announcement the day it aired on Democracy Now a couple of weeks ago, and although she sounds great there isn't much at all to distinguish her from Bernie. When Amy Goodman asked how she was different, she said that unlike Bernie she isn't backed by a 'big-money' party. I am a huge Bernie supporter with a professional background in politics and I can tell you the DNC/Democratic party establishment does not back him. Hillary is their preferred choice, but I'm a true populist progressive and I love Bernie and all my friends are Bernie supporters. His short-lived campaign has gotten liberals who don't care about politics energized and amped to participate for a change, and he doesn't accept SuperPac money.   I'm just curious and wondering why support Jill Stein if Bernie is the best chance at getting a progressive to the White House? I think it'd make more sense to support him in state primaries against Hillary if we all want the same thing.   Not trying to hate on Stein - I do like her. I just have Green Party friends and was wondering what your party members' thoughts were?"
GreenParty,3d5pse,attorneyatloblaw,20,Mon Jul 13 19:17:21 2015 UTC,You are not alone. I wonder this myself often. If I were Jill I'd be throwing my weight behind Bernie and hoping he picks me up for VP. A female green party vp would be a major step.
GreenParty,3d5pse,kylander,9,Mon Jul 13 19:34:24 2015 UTC,"The only reason I voted for Stein last election was because there was absolutely no danger of my state turning red.

HOWEVER, up next on that list is the Dems, mostly on social, education, and regulatory issues where there is a ton of overlap between parties.  don't really know where I was headed with this....  But a Sanders/Stein winning ticket would be by far the best thing that could happen to the US.  That said, I find it highly unlikely."
GreenParty,3d5pse,growingupsux,5,Mon Jul 13 20:24:47 2015 UTC,"I agree with you.  Last year I served as a deputy campaign manager for a progressive liberal Democrat challenging a GOP incumbent (we lost).   The Green Party candidate said she would throw her support behind us in the election, all we needed to do was ask her (we did & she did).  It made sense, we were for all the policies she was for, and got about 35% of the vote, so were a more viable option. Still the DCCC gave us no $, and we were out-raised by a factor of 100:1  The Green party support was about a 2-3% boost in our results, and if Green Partiers hate what HRC represents (I do) i think it'd make sense to switch party affiliations to try and help Bernie beat her.

GreenParty,3d5pse,Inuma,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:49:07 2015 UTC,"Not trying to hate on Stein - I do like her. I just have Green Party friends and was wondering what your party members' thoughts were?    Most of us have supported an insurgent or leftist Dem before.  We've learned via experience that the Democratic Party is not democratic--the monied corporate candidate ultimately wins.  And if somehow the progressive base gets control of part of the party apparatus and the insurgent candidate wins (see the movement that nominated McGovern in 72) then the establishment makes sure he's destroyed, compelling the Democratic base to go with another moderate in the next election, who ultimately helps hand the party apparatus back to corporate interests.  Since 1976 (about the time when neoliberalism got going), the Democratic Party has become (once again) a corporate party in the hands of monied interests.  This phenomenon intensified during the Clinton years and has culminated with the Obama presidency where many key staff members are employees from Goldman Sachs.  What we need is a party with a genuinely grassroots democratic institutional structure that will guarantee that our candidates represent the people, and this is what the Greens are trying to build.    The Bernie phenomenon is the most refreshing moment in Democratic Party politics in my lifetime.  But it's noteworthy that the candidate isn't even a Democrat, and is seen as a longshot even though he (like Ron Paul did in 08 and 12) is drawing huge crowds and has way more grassroots support than any corporate candidate.  Yes, he has a better chance of winning the presidency than Stein, but it's still a miniscule chance, and not enough of one to compel us to stop trying to build up an independent 3rd party that represents the interests of the vast majority of citizens."
GreenParty,3d5pse,Illin_Spree,10,Tue Jul 21 10:43:58 2015 UTC,"The Green Party should do the right thing and abolish its policy of prohibiting cross-endorsement (all political parties should), and should endorse Sanders.

GreenParty,3d5pse,gregbard,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:38:45 2015 UTC,"Historically, cross-endorsement is often the death of 3rd parties.  See the Populist Party in 1896.  The founders of the Socialist Party of America were so scarred by the implosion of the Populists that they forbade cross-endorsement in their founding documents.  The Greens are coming at the issue from a similar perspective.    Nobody is stopping anyone from registering Democrat and supporting Sanders if they want to.  But the Green Party is not going to close up shop just because alot of people have (mistakenly) bought into the notion that the Democratic primary race is fair and that an insurgent like Bernie can win it."
GreenParty,3d5pse,Illin_Spree,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:52:55 2015 UTC,"Like I said, at some point someone has to put the public interest ahead of the interest of the party.  We need to establish nonpartisan elections like they did in California. The Green Party opposed that too."
GreenParty,3d5pse,gregbard,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:15:57 2015 UTC,"If you look at the data, Top 2 elections have helped enable the dominance of corporate parties and corporate candidates.  In Top 2 states like California and Arizona, now only Ds and Rs are on the ballot come November.  Monied interests pushed for these reforms in part because the Green Party was building up steam in California and challenging the Republicrats in key cities like San Francisco as well as in Richmond (see the Richmond Progressive Alliance).  A good historical example is the San Francisco mayoral race of 2006, where the corporate Dems pulled out all the stops to stop Matt Gonzalez and elect Gavin Newsom.   To have authentic representative democracy, we need approval voting or instant runoff voting or proportional representation (as it exists in many European nations).  The Greens and other 3rd parties support these reforms and the duopoly opposes them."
GreenParty,3d5pse,Illin_Spree,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:20:01 2015 UTC,"I hate to tell you this, but there really is no crying about being eliminated from top-two general elections. the voters wanted it that way or you'd be there. You can't and shouldn't win an election from third place. The open nonpartisan system they have is the only chance that candidates from third parties have. This is consistent with the fact that the only place third party candidates ever win is in nonpartisan elections at the local level.  Instant Runoff Voting is completely unacceptable. It is a mathematically unsound system that will assign a winner arbitrarily in close elections. The run-off serves a good function to frame the debate about fundamental issues, and it an additional opportunity to practice democracy.   In the case of individual offices like mayor, governor, and president a 50%+1 majority should be required universally. It's simple majoritarianism and fundamental democracy.   Some proportional system would be acceptable for offices that consist in committee membership, like council member, legislator or congress.  I wouldn't criticize the Ds and Rs about being corporatists while the Greens oppose nonpartisan elections. That is also a corporatist position because it puts the interest of the party ahead of the public interest."
GreenParty,3d5pse,gregbard,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:31:01 2015 UTC,"Well, California voters also opposed labeling GMOs following a massive corporate campaign.  They vote against their own interests all the time.  Democracy and capitalism are not exactly compatible when you consider that media control determines what information people are exposed to.  IRV is far more democratic than first-past-the-post.  It allows people to state their actual preferences even if the preference does not necessarily win the race.  Top 2 means the voter's choice is limited to 2 corporate-approved choices.    Proportional representation is the most democratic way to fill congressional offices, but the duopoly parties have always opposed proportional representation and they collaborated to eliminate all local PR elections in the USA from 1900-1950.  First-past-the-post allows monied interests to control the system and keep minority views from being represented.   I wouldn't criticize the Ds and Rs about being corporatists while the Greens oppose nonpartisan elections. That is also a corporatist position because it puts the interest of the party ahead of the public interest.   The Greens are for authentic grassroots democracy that takes minority as well as majority views into account.  The duopoly is for command and control of elections in favor of bankster interests.  That's why monied interests poured tons of money into convincing gullible voters to support Top 2."
GreenParty,3d5pse,Illin_Spree,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:41:08 2015 UTC,"The GMO issue is misunderstood by most people, and the scientists who do understand it don't support labeling (including those not financially interested). I think we need a little more science literacy. I wouldn't say labeling is so bad except that it doesn't mean what most people think it means.  I understand IRV perfectly well. I have studied elective systems mathematically, I was a campaign manager, and as an elected official I authored an election policy. Please look into Arrow's theorem, as it proves that such systems do not determine non-arbitrary winners in some close elections. You judge an elective system by how it handles close elections. I can tell you unequivocally that IRV is a mathematically unsound system, and that soundness is the bare minimum that any elective system sould have.  I was a strong supporter of the open nonpartisan elective system  that was established (against the efforts of the Ds, Rs Gs and Ls) in California. It was basically a miracle that the people stood against the parties and did the right thing. I think people who oppose it really don't fully understand the fundamentals of elective systems.  To oppose it is literally to oppose the fundamental principles of democracy that A) the majority rules, and B) every vote counts."

GreenParty,3d5pse,intlnews,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:27:18 2015 UTC,"Kevin Zeese nailed it in the comments   If you want to support a Democrat, get out of the Green Party to do so. When Sanders loses next April you can rejoin the Greens. The Democratic Party is well-designed to ensure that people like Sanders (or Dennis Kucinich or Jesse Jackson) can never win. When 20% of the delegates are superdelegates who do not have to vote based on how people vote in primaries, as it is in the Democratic primary process. The superdelegates serve as an effective block of the people's will. And, the primaries are designed to prevent upstarts from challenging Wall Street Democrats, e.g. there are 24 primaries or caucuses in March. Unless you have hundreds of millions of advertising dollars you can't compete in half the states in one month. So, go advocate for Sanders. He stands for lots of good issues (but on some key issues he is terrible, e.g. militarism and Israel) and when it is over you can re-join the Green Party. But, it is inappropriate to advocate for another party from within the Green Party.   Stromgem has every right to advocate for Sanders but he crossed the line taking his advocacy into Green Party spaces.  We can all understand why people are excited about Sanders, but we also need Greens preparing the way for Green campaigns between now and May-June when Sanders likely loses the primary to a corporate Dem.  If everybody is out there campaigning for Sanders then nobody will be doing the groundwork for the Stein campaign that will be our best option once Sanders loses.  Note that it looks like the Green Party will be the only significant leftist 3rd party contesting the 2016 election.  Splitting and/or weakening the Greens is one of the ways that Sanders might be helping the establishment, even though on the whole I see his candidacy as a positive development."

And then the organizations that sponsor candidates - such as teachers unions and environmental groups - will say things like ""While we agree completely with the green party candidate, we can't endorse you because you won't win."", so the money goes to one of the two candidates.   Poor ballot access and other rules and legal challenges. No recognition by the media. No money from 3rd party organizations.   Maybe if we had a serious (already) celebrity candidate we could take a seat a little easier because such candidates have money, and anything they do is classified as news.

GreenParty,3bhnu1,Re_Re_Think,2,Mon Jun 29 12:52:56 2015 UTC,My thoughts exactly. They think they can build a strong party movement over the course of just one election.
GreenParty,3bhnu1,GlobalMediaMonster,6,Sat Jul 4 18:09:58 2015 UTC,"Here in the US, we have a voting system called ""First Past the Post"" (alluding to a metaphorical post marking the end of a race) for many of the important individual seats at both the stat level and the federal level.    First-past-the-post is a winner-take-all, voting system that has majoritarian effects.  That means that, in elections, the agent that gets 50%+1 (crosses the halfway mark) of the vote wins all of the representation, and the agents that get less than that, even if they get 50%-1 of all the votes, get no representation.    And in fact, the main party that is ideologically closest to the third party challenger to the status quo is often the one actually hurt most when people only have one choice of candidate voting preference (as you do in FPTP) and vote for the third party over it.  This is called the Spoiler Effect, and it has happened in real world elections, most notably in recent history, in the 2000 Presidential election.    Unless the third party attempting to challenge the status quo gains such a meteoric rise in popularity, and one of the two main political parties becomes so untenable unpopular that it basically collapses (and the third party is usually still closest, in ideology, to this main party), third parties have no chance of ""breaking through"" and replacing the main party.  This has only happened a handful of times in all of the 200 years of US history (on the national scale, at least).  I think we should demand a more responsive representative democracy than that.    Anyway, the Spoiler Effect, and FPTP's tendency towards a 2 party system over repeated elections is not a philosophical argument.  It is a mathematically demonstrable fact, and has been empirically observed in election simulations and in real world elections.    If third parties (of any ideology) under FPTP voting systems want any realistic chance of influence, the absolute first thing on their agenda should be reforming the voting system, because they won't get political power otherwise (unless, as said before, one of the political parties, refusing to reform itself, becomes so untenable it actually completely collapses).    The problem, of course, becomes ""How does one reform a system that is preventing itself from being reformed?""    Or in this specific case, ""How does one elect representatives under a FPTP system, who will replace FPTP?""  It seems they won't have an immediate, personal incentive to change a system that favored their victory.  However, reforms to our system have happened in the past.  Even the most self-interested politician hates being called out as such, in public.  If we frame First Past the Post as a completely broken way of representation (which it is), that only the most self-interested, greedy, power hungry, screw-everyone-but-me despots would support, politicians may eventually feel the pressure to distance themselves from it.      So what do we replace FPTP with? Many superior alternative voting systems exist.  My personal favorite is Approval Voting (reddit's voting system can be thought of as a kind of approval voting implementation), but there are many systems that reduce the spoiler effect in comparison to FPTP."
GreenParty,3bhnu1,SlowRollingBoil,3,Mon Jun 29 16:00:25 2015 UTC,I agree completely. I think the U.S electoral system needs a serious re-thinking. If we had a voting system more like a European country or Canada I think our party would have a chance here.

GreenParty,37lc3q,karmicnoose,1 point,Thu May 28 20:45:47 2015 UTC,"Ok, so my understanding of the linked article is that The Economist's original article can be debunked because rather than using the average income to calculate the rate of tax, we should be using the median income (because of the gap in earnings between the poor and the wealthy is bigger than it was been in the past- have I got that right?). And that in addition, switching to a basic income system would mean the ability to cut other existing welfare. (Although, I can't see a cost for implementing the new system mentioned anywhere in the article.)  But I get lost in the very last bit, where the article talks about the basic income working as a ""essentially a giant tax rebate."", in works in the example they give, and they explain that ""because a very small amount of people have an almost unimaginable amount of money at the very top, a basic income could actually decrease almost everyone else's income tax burdens except for theirs."" But wouldn't that mean that we'd be relying on keeping a a group of super-wealthy people in order to pay for the basic income of everyone else? Is it actually improving equality?"
GreenParty,37lc3q,GrrrlStyleNow,2,Sun May 31 12:56:40 2015 UTC,"basic income is a cash gift of equal size to every adult (unemployed and billionaires alike).  That cash gift, to a taxpayer, is equivalent to a tax reduction/rebate.   But wouldn't that mean that we'd be relying on keeping a a group of super-wealthy people in order to pay for the basic income of everyone else?   That group does face higher tax rates.  They can freely choose to quit all work, move to Somalia, or run a telethon so we can donate relief funds for their oppressive misfortunate lifestyle that forces upon them paying a portion of their high incomes as taxes.  If they choose to keep working, they stand to make much more pre and post taxes as a result of collecting money from everyone else spending their UBI."
GreenParty,37lc3q,Godspiral,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:59:28 2015 UTC,"Perhaps I wasn't clear enough in my question. I of course understand that the wealthy already pay higher taxes and can choose not to work or to leave the country if they wish. What I meant to ask was, is the basic income system only affordable so long as we have a super-wealthy group to pay for it? Or, in a theoretical society with better income equality, (and so fewer people paying top rates of tax) would the system fail to be financially viable?"
GreenParty,37lc3q,GrrrlStyleNow,2,Tue Jul 7 15:03:49 2015 UTC,"is the basic income system only affordable so long as we have a super-wealthy group to pay for it?   Its affordable relative to society.  There will always be ""wealthy"" groups in a society.  In a simplified stereotype of Ghana, the rich are those with farmland and goats and chickens.  If you tax their profits for redistribution, they will be able to produce more goats and chickens and other food, as everyone else is able to afford them, and so they become richer.  The UBI level in Ghana would be relative to their society income, but it would elevate all incomes and wealth.  UBI doesn't need an unequal society to fund it, and the main benefit of UBI is improving everyone's life (making the pie higher) rather than equalizing incomes (shares of the pie)   to leave the country if they wish   income taxes is never a reason to leave a country.  You want to retire to a high income tax country, because you won't make any income and so not be taxed on it, but benefit from a developed and happy society.  wealth/property taxes are what can cause people to leave"
GreenParty,37lc3q,Godspiral,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:01:55 2015 UTC,"Ok, thanks for that, its much clearer with an example. It sounds like it would still be workable and positive in effect as long as there is a 'wealthier' group. I suppose though, that it becomes a much harder sell as a policy, (even if the economics is sound and makes everyone richer), when the group that's funding UBI is mainly chicken farmers rather than bankers. In the line about leaving the country, that was a reference to you mentioning moving to Somalia in your earlier comment. Thanks again."

The actual case against UBI has nothing (directly) to do with wealth.  Instead, the reason to oppose UBI is retaining power.  Everyone becomes richer through UBI, but powerful farmers or bankers and their friends in government lose the privilege of directing social revenue to just themselves (banking and farming subsidies and the rewards of providing them).  There are many people (though by necessity a minority) who benefit from a harsh oppressive world with legal loopholes around slavery and bribes, and have a firm attachment to keeping that system."

In the future, even if we design solar powered computers that turn on in an instant just like our hand held calculators do today, we will still have developed other more new and different energy hungry technology for a greatly increased population that depends on it for continued civilization.  There is no scenario of a continued civilization that does not involve the use nuclear power.

The opposition will press hard on any fundamental policy differences between those parties to exaggerate any division.   Because of that, with the adversarial style of politics we're lumbered with here, I doubt a minority government will survive much past a year.

Therefore she knows very well that ""first past the post"" vote counting will drive any so-called ""center-left"" candidate away from any chance of winning.  The reason is, if a big(ger) shot like Warren were to run under a third party (Greens being the obvious choice as the 2nd largest ""left"" organization), she would enable the Greens to gain some traction in future races, thus more people switching to Green, and there's no central ""left wing"" organization left in the American political sphere. The problem is that, also because of plurality voting currently set in place, there won't be enough votes for anyone on the left to reach the votes needed, while the Republicans can take advantage of that and still win the amount of votes needed to win the presidency.   However, I want this to happen. I actually want to be able to vote for the candidate I like for a party that I like.

Witness the higher French productivity with lower work hours than the UK or most of the rest of Europe. In practice this applies more to office-type jobs than shelf-stacking jobs (who can be worked slave-like if the employers are nasty enough); my French colleagues typically spend less time at the water cooler, reading Facebook, etc. and get more work done, but are more insistent on work hours. Simply put, they work harder but shorter hours, which I agree with. We have a nasty tendency to let work expand to fill the hours available, a tendency that needs to be actively fought against.  Higher minimum wage: beyond being fairer, it incentivizes automating the more menial, poorer-paid jobs.   Cars above 80 mph: Add speed limiters. These are standard on trucks. I'm not sure you can get after-market speed limiters, but they should be straightforward given the size of the UK market. For most modern vehicles with Energy Management systems, this can even come down to a simple software upgrade.  For Trident: replace with more 'usable' army. For the most part, Russia, etc. would be more deterred by 10,000 troops that the country is willing to use, than nukes it is not.

I'm confused by your statement here. Statistically, there are more single mothers than single fathers, so statistically, more children will end up in care if 100 women go to prison than if 100 men go to prison. This isn't an issue of equality, it's an issue of statistics, of how things are. I mean, ideally, no child should have a family situation whereby if a parent goes to prison they'd end up in care (and not, for example, being looked after by the other parent, aunts and uncles, grandparents etc).  Statistically also women are more likely to be victims of domestic abuse. Whether the statistics are in fact correct or not is another thing; it's likely male victims of domestic abuse are underreported, because social norms mean that it's an embarrassing thing for a man to be ""beaten up by a woman"", though thankfully that idea, and the idea that a man has to sort his own problems, is starting to get chipped away as a result of increased equality.  As for mental health, I don't know how the prison stats are, but in the general population it's pretty evenly split by gender. Slightly different in terms of what comes from mental health problems, but about equal in who has them (eg, women are more likely to attempt suicide than men, but men are more likley to actually commit suicide than women).  I suspect the Green Party is leading with women with this prison policy mainly as a means to reduce children in care as quickly as possible, and will follow up with the same policies as concerns men shortly afterward.    On a different note, bear in mind that statistically, the Green Party is highly unlikely to actually get into government. Chances are there will be between 1 and 6 Green MPs. So chances are that none of these policies will be put into action wholesale in the 2015-2020 term of government. However, with some Green MPs in the House of Commons, whether part of the coalition or the opposition, will mean that policies like these, and the others the Greens support, will be pushed. It might not be that the prison policy outlined above gets anywhere near to being implemented, but it might be that judges are instructed to consider non-custodial sentences in non-violent cases more. Or it might be that instead of whatever minimum wage increase the major party at the head of a coalition had promised, the Greens can encourage it to be a few pence higher each time.  Or it might be that, like me, you live in a safe seat that the sitting MP is highly unlikely to lose, and that voting for Green in that situation will serve merely to help the Green candidate retain their £500 deposit by getting 5% of the vote."

GreenParty,32g2rt,JohnKimble111,11,Mon Apr 13 14:44:44 2015 UTC,"Natalie Bennett did an AMA a while ago here was her answer to the question about this area of policy:   The Green Party is “committed to significantly reducing the prison population” (CJ340 - http://policy.greenparty.org.uk/cj.html). That’s for men and women. But as founding chair of Green Party Women, I was involved in the adoption of this policy, because of the nature of the female prison population. A high proportion are sole carers (whose children can end up in care, innocents being punished), many are victims of sexual assault and domestic violence, many have mental health issues - this is a place to start, but what it is only the start of a far more humane, practical, evidence-based policy for the whole criminal justice system. If you want to read more about this … http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2014/apr/22/prison-women-trauma-stephanie-covington   and    One point I would make is that sentencing of sole carers in my opinion should take into account the damage done to their children, whatever the gender of the carer. Our policy on sentencing starts: “Wholly unacceptable levels of men, women and children are currently imprisoned at great cost to their future rehabilitation, as well as to their families, the taxpayer and society in general.” We want to change that for everyone. But this specific policy is based on the recommendations of the extensive Corston report, welcomed by organisations like the Prison Reform Trust and the Howard League for Prison Reform among others."
GreenParty,32g2rt,RoseTintedHaze,5,Mon Apr 13 16:22:11 2015 UTC,"So since ""sole carers"" can be both male and female, wouldn't it make sense to frame the policy around that concept alone?"
GreenParty,32g2rt,admnstrator,0,Tue Apr 14 16:42:50 2015 UTC,"This seems to clarify the position as being reasonable as far as I'm concerned. It's certainly not sexist, it's just being framed as placing importance on children not losing their primary caretaker due to be imprisoned for a nonviolent crime. Seems like OP is looking for something that's not there in order to justify a narrative of men being oppressed, which is frankly not something I'd like to see leak into /r/greenparty from elsewhere on Reddit."

The MRM has demonstrated a long and consistent history of dishonesty which you are furthering, both through attempting to create the appearance of a group dissenting from the Green Party's position, and then by mischaracterizing the position.   Here's the Corston Report: http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/docs/corston-report-march-2007.pdf which is the basis for the policy. If you want to actually argue the merits instead of coming up with your arguments first and then hoping they stick, I suggest starting there."

GreenParty,32g2rt,beorming,1 point,Tue Apr 14 22:54:51 2015 UTC,"Not a satisfactory answer from Bennett, there's absolutely no need to single out women if a term such as ""parents"" would be more valid.   many are victims of sexual assault and domestic violence, many have mental health issues   All these things also apply to men, and men are subject to more violence overall than women too. I also note on the same policy page the Party blatantly lies about domestic violence, stating: ""it is acknowledged that a large majority of cases involve abuse by men against women"".  This is totally false - the UK crime survey shows that 40% of domestic violence victims are men, so the number of women who are victims is 60% at most. However, that survey ignores children  taking the number of women easily below 50% and that's still women abused by anyone. DV is particularly high in lesbian relationships so this amazingly specific crime of violence by men against women is smaller still. The Green Party i lying about domestic violence and then it uses this lie to attempt to justify it's sexist prison policy.  Anyway thanks for the link, I was already a firm believer that Greens needed to get rid of Bennett, and if she's also one fo those responsible for introducing such shockingly sexist policies then she really needs to go ASAP."

Try to put your preconceptions aside first (good advice for all of us).  http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/docs/corston-report-march-2007.pdf"
GreenParty,32g2rt,SpacedOutKarmanaut,-7,Wed Apr 15 01:24:28 2015 UTC,"I'm sceptical about a lot of these supposedly expert reports, and the most important thing is often to uncover any bias (or stupidity) of the author or research it is based upon.  They tend to be a mixed bag really, for example the Stern review into rape was fantastic by all accounts, whereas the Norgrove report into shared parenting was based on complete lies and has since been completely debunked, with a researcher taking issue into a completely false interpretation of her work.  I imagine this research is more Norgrove-like than Stern-like and at best it only tells half the story. For example it's absolutely true that an awful lot of women who are in prison simply don't belong there (tv licence evaders for example). However, what the various researchers and pressure groups fail to mention is that such prisoners are at least matched and almost certainly outnumbered by the vast proportion of female criminals who benefit from bias in the justice system at every single stage (and therefore should currently be locked up in place of the other women).  Up to 20% of peadophiles are women yet there number in prison is absolutely tiny. Similarly, women are actually more likely to initiate domestic violence against their partner than the other way round and at least 40% of domestic violence victims are men, yet the number pf women actually prosecuted for violence and abuse of men is still very small, and the actual number imprisoned smaller still.  The entire present narrative on this issue is essentially a complete lie. The idea that the justice system overall discriminates against women is the complete opposite of reality, and we have judges openly admittng they'd have given harsher sentences to female criminals had they been male. Philip Davies MP gave an excellent speech in Parliament a while back outlining this, which I'd recommend to anyone interested in the topic."
GreenParty,32g2rt,RoseTintedHaze,7,Mon Apr 13 16:33:03 2015 UTC,"By all means, be skeptical of any report - regardless of source. But you cannot be skeptical of a report you haven't read. You can intelligently disagree with the merits of the arguments within but discounting it before reading is pure prejudice.  Fwiw, I disagree with the current emphasis of the policy while agreeing with the intent. I hope enough members will argue for sole carers to be recognised regardless of sex across all policies, this is how it works in the Green Party."
GreenParty,32g2rt,ThePrecariat,3,Mon Apr 13 16:59:05 2015 UTC,Defending prison rape? Really classy. How the hell is getting raped in prison in any way the same argument as working in a somewhat inherently dangerous profession?

I'm trying to point out the double standard where MRA find out outrageous they women don't want to be told ""they should be more careful so they don't get raped"" but the opposite argument is considered offensive. Or whatever. For you guys, the onus is on women to stop being victims, but on society to treat men better. There's literally no reason feminists and MRA can't work together, but instead you go around spewing bile about ""most feminsts being sexist / fascist / angry buzzwords.""  But whatever.

GreenParty,32g2rt,badsarcasmdetector,2,Mon Apr 13 21:38:54 2015 UTC,"the report, and the policy, is about women in prisons.  The report says there are a large number of women who go to prison have been abused.  it is just presented as a fact.    The reason it makes such recommendations are actually because of some of the following:  The Corston report suggests that women are much more likley to self harm / commit suicide / to become mentally ill / self harm than men within prison. And so suggesting the prison system doesn't currently work as well for women, there needs to be an alternative.   The report suggests that the reason that it doesnt work as well for women is that there are much fewer women in prisons.  And for that reason the prison system was made with men in mind.  It is about the idea that actually equality is not necessarily treating everyone the same, its about getting the equal outcomes."
GreenParty,32g2rt,SpacedOutKarmanaut,0,Mon Apr 13 20:36:48 2015 UTC,"Here in the US, most green party ""Ten core principals"" include many good ones, such as deescalating war and protecting civil and human rights. Although one of them is ""Feminism"".  I'm all for equal gender rights. Recognizing LGBT peoples gender identities and treating them equally, including marriage and other civil process. But I still think ""Feminism"" is a biased concept that doesn't fit into the top ten principals of a national political party.  It should be ""Equal and inclusive rights for all genders"". Not adding the word 'feminism' directly to the core principals. It is not an equal concept, it is rights and political pursuits for women. Men have their own particular struggles, but who's going to add 'masculism' to the core principles? IMO it should just be ""Equal gender rights"", and feminism can be included in the description paragraph.  That's one of a small number of my critiques of the US green party groups. And one that makes me consider if I'm in the right group."

Within this, they have the right to self determination.  MG202 International action and a willingness to share resources will be required to meet the needs of environmental migrants.  MG203 Richer regions and communities do not have the right to use migration controls to protect their privileges from others in the long term.  MG204 Communities and regions should have the right to restrict inward migration when one or more of the following conditions are satisfied:  a)The ecology of the recipient area would be significantly adversely affected by in-comers to the detriment of the wider community (eg. National Parks, Antarctica);  b)The recipient area is owned or controlled by indigenous peoples (eg Australian aboriginal people) whose traditional lifestyle would be adversely affected by in-comers;  c)The prospective migrants have, on average, equal or greater economic power than the residents of the recipient area and they or their families were not forced to leave the area in the recent past.

GreenParty,30yyec,Slartibartfast87,0,Wed Apr 1 22:15:12 2015 UTC,"That's like the arguments on raising the minimum wage... But if you think about it, 99% of people have an income of £72 a week already, be it from work, pension or a combination of benefits. So there should be zero effect in the short term.   For those in work there would be (I assume) no net change, as what I gain in UBI I'd lose in a corresponding higher tax... Which is fine. For those on pensions, very little to no net change and those on benefits, again, little net change. Those who have slipped through the net of the welfare system would be helped and the administration cost would be reduced. Win win win.   The universality removes the red tape and provides continuity in support for every citizen."
GreenParty,30yyec,You_Fool_Doctor,1 point,Sat Apr 11 11:25:29 2015 UTC,"Yes that makes good sense.  To elaborate further on my second question: if £72 were to be introduced as UBI in the UK as a flat rate for all areas, is it reasonable to predict that a number of people struggling to find long-term employment in London/South East will begin to migrate north, where rents and services are generally cheaper?"
GreenParty,30yyec,Slartibartfast87,0,Sat Apr 11 12:51:26 2015 UTC,"They probably would. Certainly limits on who can receive it would need to be in place (British citizen who has been resident continually for 3 years, for example), but you could imagine that economic activity in the poorer areas in the North would be boosted by the arrival of people who feel they are able to move back home and take a risk, because they know they won't go destitute and have to rely on the job centre system of benefits we have now.   Where this has been trialled, people who weren't eligible moved in, because the economic activity increased - because people could take slightly more risks. I think the Green Party back this more for social reasons than economic, but it potentially could create a very stable backbone of sustainable economic activity."

""Full employment"" as it's defined generally includes 4% unemployment....and often much higher counting the U6 rating and all the long term discouraged workers.  The system will always exclude some, no matter how much we try to fix it via traditional means. Unemployment comp and welfare help, but they're too limited in scope to truly solve the problem.  4) morally, we should move away from work in general, rather than seeking to create more work for people to justify their existence through.

Very nearly everyone wants to do something productive with their life, and no policy is ever going to change that. Still, I fail to see why is this a problem, as you have framed it, given that other related problems are already with us, and are far more significant.   Technology is at a point where most people really don't need to work in order for society to provide us with everything we might reasonably ever need. A lot of jobs are already basically pointless, soul destroying busy-work that serves no greater purpose; and under our glorious neoliberal economic model, there aren't even enough of those to go round. As automation improves over the coming decades, this is going to become a far more pressing issue even than now.   We can build a society where all but the very richest must squabble for a shrinking and increasingly pointless pool of shit jobs, or we can free humanity from this bullshit and grant people the means to live a life pursuing the things they would pursue without an economic sword of Damocles hanging over them.   Exactly the sort of solution you propose is more or less in effect here in the UK. Employers respond with zero-hours contracts and other means of paying employees as little as they can possibly get away with, leaving the taxpayer to foot the bill. If this is how it turns out, why don't we implement a system where supporting citizens is part of the deal from the start, rather than a band-aid on an exploitative situation?"

We have received a wide range of feedback about our recent coverage of UKIP. Bearing in mind the pressure on licence fee resources, the following response strives to address the majority of concerns raised but we apologise in advance if not all of the specific points you have mentioned have been answered in the manner you prefer.  The amount of time spent covering a political party depends greatly on the prevailing news agenda, as well as on broader assessments of its electoral support. UKIP have been involved in a number of significant stories affecting UK politics as of late. In the past few months there have been two high profile defections from the Conservative Party to UKIP, amid speculation that more MPs could follow. This resulted in the triggering of a by-election in Clacton, which in turn saw UKIP win their first seat in Parliament followed by success in Rochester and Strood. UKIP came second in the by-election in Heywood and Middleton, only 617 votes behind the Labour Party. The party’s performance in these by-elections has seen UKIP making inroads in Labour and Conservative strongholds.  These results come following UKIP topping the poll in the 2014 European elections, beating all the Westminster parties in terms of seats (24) and share of the vote (more than 27% - up more than 10% on 2009). The party have also performed strongly in local government elections in England for the past two years and have been regularly polling in the mid-teens for more than two years, well ahead, for instance, of the Liberal Democrats and around 10 percentage points ahead of the Greens.  Taking all these factors into consideration, it follows that UKIP have featured in our news coverage as of late. As with any other political party, they have been properly held to account. The party’s representatives have been suitably pressed and challenged on their policies and positions during flagship programmes like ‘Question Time’, ‘Today’ and ‘Newsnight’. The 13 October edition of Panorama looked specifically at Nigel Farage’s leadership, exploring his background, business dealings and often controversial political positions.  While discussing core UKIP policies, particularly membership of the EU and immigration, opposing political perspectives have featured, allowing our audience to make up their own minds on the issues at hand.  We believe our coverage relating to UKIP has been proportionate and impartial and don’t agree with any suggestion of bias in favour of the party.  Rest assured, we do value your feedback. All complaints are sent to senior management team every morning and I included your points in this overnight report. These reports are among the most widely read sources of feedback in the BBC and ensures that your concerns have been seen by the right people quickly. This helps inform their decisions about current and future programmes. """

GreenParty,2xt8ty,archbox,2,Tue Mar 3 20:12:28 2015 UTC,"The advantage that this has over our current system is that it's based on trust. Our current western neoliberal dogma is based on distrust. People on welfare need to show they don't spend a penny too much or they'll lose their welfare. This results in people becoming stressed. The idea is often that putting people under pressure, makes them more conscious about their checks and balances. The reality is that the stress this produces only makes people act less responsibly. A very small group of welfare frauds gives wellfare a bad name. This leads to problems for the much larger group of people that actually use it for what it is meant for.  Unconditional Basic Income, on the other hand, is based on trust. Everyone, rich or poor, old or young, sick or healthy, gets the same basic income. This could, for example, be a country's minimum wage level or whatever is considered necessary to provide everyone with basic needs. Instead of wasting taxpayer money on the bureaucracy needed to make sure people get no more welfare than they deserve, why not just give them whatever an average person spends on the most basic needs like food, housing, education, healthcare etc.? This is simply considered a right under a UBI system.  Wanna buy a new TV or a fancy car? You will still have to work for that. Many people think free money doesn't stimulate people to work. But what if you get bored and want to try something new? You would have the freedom to pursue such a goal with basic income. What if you can't find work? After all, that is a realistic problem in an age where technology makes many jobs obsolete. By giving people more security, they will be less stressed out when they can't find a job right away and can actually take the time to find one later. Plus, it makes the 21st century job market of flexibility, temporary contracts and freelancers - often stressed as necessary but leading to social insecurity - much more morally and socially acceptible.  If the increasing number of experiments point towards it being affordable and realistic, I think we should very seriously consider it. It reduces inequality and poverty - which appeals to the leftists - while it maximizes freedom, entrepeneurialism and job flexibility, a traditionally right-wing goal."

UBI is Universal Social Security.   Give people money, they spend it on the things they see the most need for.

GreenParty,2xt8ty,driverdave,2,Tue Mar 3 23:48:44 2015 UTC,"You seem to have a lack of depth in your understanding of essentially all aspects.    after we've ended poverty, what incentives are there for the people receiving this cash to improve their life and contribute to society in a meaningful, macro way?   BI isn't particularly upwardly mobile in isolation. There's still great incentive to earn beyond doing all manner of things and it actually makes turning inward on the family or community far more economically viable.   or is that even considered? poverty is solved, so it doesn't matter what these people do?   In the long run we'd expect people to fall along a wide distribution of possibilities while alleviating the destruction wrought by global capitalism. There's no one destination, but it's quite acceptable and perhaps desirable to have people opting out of the labor market to focus on personal interests.   i'd rather see someone become educated, find a job or career that they find gratifying, not require further use of social services, and contribute back to society.   BI is offset by the tax code which supports it. Advancing income claws back the BI payments making them eventually nil. It depends on the tax code, but all proposals I've viewed remove the poverty trap of the system you seem interested in mimicking which was largely constructed in the 20th century.   what incentives are there for the people earning this cash given to the poor? how does giving their cash to the poor help them?   If you don't know the answer to that question, you've little to no understanding of left wing political analysis. Frankly your posts in this thread wreak of capitalist ideology.   i'd rather live in a society where people are working, learning, volunteering, etc..., and social services incentivizes those activities.   None of those things are done by the system created in the 20th century which you seem to want to expand upon. The means tested nature and limitation of choice inherent to in kind transfers create massive gaps in supply to demand while introducing poverty traps and inefficiencies in bureaucracy while applying the means tests in a heavy fisted manner.  I'm barely even scratching the surface of how stuck in the past your thinking is. Emergent technology is going to render the global labor market dysfunctional within our probable lifetimes. The system you're talking about propping up is a dying relic of the past once machine learning starts rapidly eliminating information work such as law, medical diagnostics and analysis of complexity on a scale human minds can scarcely comprehend."
GreenParty,2xt8ty,James_GAF,-1,Wed Mar 4 12:49:28 2015 UTC,"all of the questions i asked, you basically answered with ""you're so stuck in the past, i can't even comment on this"".  your condescending tone is really helping me see your point.  i mentioned one successful program that utah is doing here: http://www.nationofchange.org/utah-ending-homelessness-giving-people-homes-1390056183  is this program stuck in the past and 20th century?  you don't even mention it. i guess it's so ""20th century"" that you can't even begin to comment on it.  are those people in utah stuck in a ""poverty trap""?  go outside, look around. i don't see anything close to what you are talking about. it sounds like a science fiction novel (a good one though).  maybe you can point out a current, successful implementation of your theory where ""emergent technology"" renders human labor redundant, and the residents of the utopia don't have to do any ""20th century work"" and live off their GBI the robots pay the taxes for.  people have been saying this sort of stuff forever, that technology will render human labor redundant. if you look at the transformation that the US economy has undergone in the past 50 years, this is not the case. we've transformed from production to services.  just give me one link to a current example of your utopia in action. maybe i'll move there, it sounds great."

GreenParty,2x3jnk,Toxication,5,Wed Feb 25 10:06:09 2015 UTC,It's too close to election now... let's get through the election then look to replace if that's the will of party...
GreenParty,2x3jnk,PyschoCandy,3,Wed Feb 25 12:29:14 2015 UTC,"But what if her leadership irreparably damages the party's reputation? This could be the best chance the Greens will have in a long time to get seats by making the most of the current political climate and undecided voters. If that chance is messed up by making it look like the Greens don't have a clue, it could be a massive setback. After the election, and particularly the television debates, it could be too late to win back people whose decisions about the party have been made. First impressions and all that!"
GreenParty,2x3jnk,PyschoCandy,5,Wed Feb 25 13:20:36 2015 UTC,"we are looking to keep 1 seat, and if we do really good maybe 2.   This one gaffe will not change that.  Other leaders have had plenty of gaffes too."
GreenParty,2x3jnk,PyschoCandy,2,Wed Feb 25 13:22:44 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, the key difference is that other leaders' gaffes make them look like idiots, whilst Natalie's gaffes make it look like the Green Party doesn't have any realistic policies, making it less about her and more about the whole party."
GreenParty,2x3jnk,PyschoCandy,4,Wed Feb 25 13:32:39 2015 UTC,I disagree :) other party leaders have proven to be inept with policies on occasion too.  it's 2 month to election... there is not going be a leadership change before then.  period.
GreenParty,2x3jnk,PyschoCandy,1 point,Wed Feb 25 13:40:56 2015 UTC,"In that case, would you maybe like to see other people representing the party in interviews a little more, maybe to take pressure off Natalie? In the Sunday Politics interview, she was asked whether Caroline Lucas would take part in the leadership debates instead. What would be your opinion on this, given Natalie's performances in much less high-pressure interviews, and Caroline's experience as an MP?"
GreenParty,2x3jnk,OK_TimeForPlan_L,5,Wed Feb 25 13:46:41 2015 UTC,IMO Caroline Lucas seems to hold her own better in such situations...  But in leadership debates the leader should be there.

She's had a few bad interviews and I understand people are feeling frustrated - after all Natalie was particularly vocal about wanting the Greens to get more media coverage. She obviously crumbled a bit when being pressed about specific figures in both of the interviews you mention. There will be lessons learned from this and I hope she's getting some media-savvy coaching about now.   However, it's far too soon to be talking about replacing someone who has been more than competent in every other part of her job. Chucking her out now would just be a knee-jerk reaction. It would be jumped upon as heartless which could actually be more damaging than the bad interviews themselves. I don't want the Greens to turn into another ruthless, unfeeling part of the political establishment. We're not here to ""win at all costs"" like the rest of them.  Hopefully she won't feel she has to respond in exact detail to every question from now on - nobody can know the minutiae of every policy. It is enough to say that ""The Greens have fully costed every policy commitment through various changes in taxation and legislation. The detail is in our manifesto"". That's all she needs to know."

I want to see her standing up for the party's principles and policies and not shying away from tough questions like the rest do, but I'm struggling to support her.    I hope you're right about her learning lessons from this and getting coaching because she needs to do a bit of reputation repair over the coming weeks and months."
GreenParty,2x3jnk,LadyCatTree,3,Wed Feb 25 13:53:02 2015 UTC,"The thing is, it's not feasible for anyone to memorise that level of detail for every policy. Sometimes you just have to gracefully put your hands up and say ""I don't know the answer to your question"". The ""political language"" is just there to say ""But don't assume we're just chucking in wild ideas off the back of a fag packet - these have all been properly thought through and costed"".   One concession to all this I will have to make... I was already disappointed that it wouldn't be Caroline Lucas in the TV debates. She has proven herself to be particularly excellent in interviews and on Question Time. Natalie must be more resilient in those."
GreenParty,2x3jnk,Slartibartfast87,2,Wed Feb 25 14:05:11 2015 UTC,"I suppose you're right, but the problem is right now she's making it look like they are just chucking in wild ideas that haven't been thought through.    I guess it's a bit ironic that Lucas stepped down as leader to focus on being an MP, and now that there's a chance of building on that MP, the fact she's not leader could hamper chances of having an MP at all in the next parliament."

I don't think this party should want to have anything to do with Read. At least UKIP have the sense to kick out those who are too vocal about their bigotry. Read is a bigot, but oh I forgot, racism and homophobia are senstive issues so those kinds of bigotry are important and worth kicking someone out over; people don't care about bigotry when directed against trans people so it's not such of a PR disaster to have a transphobe as a candidate.  Bigotry is more than a PR problem, though. He should be kicked out or at least taken off the candidate list."

GreenParty,2vpyvq,the_pirou,7,Sat Feb 14 00:50:22 2015 UTC,"What is the Green Party answer to dealing with ISIL   That's a very broad question that doesn't have a singular answer.  On an individual level most of us probably take some form of anti-war/assassination/death penalty stance, so we're always going to be concerned about initiating or aggravating such situations.  At the same time, if you asked how the Green Party felt about use of Marines near al-Baghdadi at this very moment to suppress or halt IS advance in the region, many of them would not be opposed at seeing IS zealotry ameliorated by use of force.  The idea of the Green Party outright 'handling' IS through policy is absurd due to the fact that our perspectives aren't as of yet shared by the majority.  If more people in society actually lived and worked on a daily basis towards our values instead of playing at corporate warhawk and social issue silly buggers, the general idea is that entities like IS would be less likely to arise in the first place because we wouldn't be exploiting foreign nations and playing games of conquest and acquisition in the name of diplomacy and freedom.    We don't support letting people get slaughtered, but we also recognize that war generally begets war.  Our 'defense' spending is out of hand, and most of us would rather see that money go to social efforts, technology, and other development aimed at societal growth and renewal instead of aggressive engagements and covert actions that only serve rich multinationals and other private interests.  How do we deal with ISIL? We don't organize and support the Afghan mujahideen during the Soviet war in Afghanistan such that people like Al-Zarqawi are radicalized and moved to form Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad with a resultant maturation of their potential for terror 25 years later."

But if Bernie were to win the DNP bid, why on earth would anyone opt for a third party when it's one of the best chances EVER to get a progressive into the White House?   I'm actually seeking an explanation. The former scenario makes sense. The latter, does not.

I'm sure the argument is pretty flimsy to suggest that a person shouldn't be arrested convicted* for a crime unless they can be proven to have been personally responsible for it, but it's my opinion that such a perspective is the only one that is just.

I don't particularly like it (because it looks like she's distancing, not because she actually is), but I think it's probably a very strong campaign strategy - those who vote Green will already vote for her, she's trying to reach those who don't vote Green so toning down the Greenness and making it about her work so far makes total sense.  Plus she probably won't have come up with these ideas by herself - she has a full time campaign manager plus other staff and an election team and stuff, so it will have been decided that this is the best way to go."

GreenParty,2uc708,threejoinedrings,5,Sat Jan 31 23:43:27 2015 UTC,"Nope, I know people in the party in that area and it's stronger than it's ever been. Not a lot of support for the council and the councillors, but apparently most people who were supporting the party (like the people voting for them, not just members) acknowledge that it's due to bad preparation and the fact that the Green Party of England and Wales were extremely inexperienced - they probably won't be re-elected but everyone I've spoken to that's been canvassing has said people love Caroline even if they're pissed off at the council. The Green Party and Caroline Lucas still have strong support from people who were supporting them before.  As I said in my post - I think that choosing not to put GPEW stuff all over her promotional materials is probably to reach out to people who wouldn't vote Green at all, and some of them might be because they saw what happened with the council, but I think it's probably more to do with tapping into the idea of ""this is your current MP, she has done [x, y, z], she's great, look at her policies, don't you want to do more"" which works well for all parties, without putting anyone else off by shouting about the party. I'm in Northern Ireland but most publications I've seen in previous elections of incumbent candidates are personality-based, whereas non-incumbent candidates tend to be more party based.  The European Parliament election broadcasts are pretty good examples for Northern Ireland - the DUP, UUP and Sinn Féin were incumbent - SF were standing in Ireland as well, so their broadcast was covering several candidates so it was party-based but the DUP and UUP are both candidate-based. The TUV weren't incumbent but had an MEP in the past, so they focussed on him as well. Meanwhile, Alliance, GPNI SDLP and NI21 all have much more party-driven broadcasts (I couldn't find Northern Ireland-specific broadcasts for the other parties who contested which were Ukip and NI Conservatives). Some of that will be down to the fact that the council elections were at the same time here so they were counting on the PEB being for council rather than European, but it's still quite a big difference that is present in leaflets for single elections - incumbent candidates get personality focus while non-incumbents get party focus. Pretty normal campaigning as far as I'm aware."

GreenParty,2tq88t,Unrelated_Incident,14,Mon Jan 26 15:41:04 2015 UTC,"A lot of these policies are being gradually changed, from what I understand. They're a bit of a lay-over from when the party was very suspicious of a lot of stuff, whereas now there's a lot of evidence-based policies coming through. Policies get changed by members challenging and suggesting alternatives though, so if you're a member it would definitely be worth contacting your local group asking if you can suggest a policy change since this is your area of expertise and it was likely written by someone who doesn't really know a lot about it. In general, policies about new technologies are ""we want full testing before we're comfortable with them being produced on wide scales, and even then we want a regulated market"" so if you talk about how a lot of this stuff is already being tested and bring forward a motion for increased testing and regulation but just remove the call for a halt, it would probably pass with little resistance. Policies exist until someone changes them, so the Green parties do need people coming forward and suggesting changes because they won't happen spontaneously!  Edit: also, my experience is in the UK and Ireland, so I just know that a lot of our anti-science policies are being changed at the minute. I assume it's somewhat similar in the US, where they had a lot of anti-science hippies to start with but as it becomes more political they're getting more people who actually know about the topic."

GreenParty,2tq88t,greenman,4,Mon Jan 26 21:38:23 2015 UTC,"Nuclear energy is unique in two aspects: the small chance of extreme damage, and the extremely long aftercare. It mostly boils down to views on risk management; Greens think in the long term so they discount far future problems much less than others, and therefore the balance tips out of favor for nuclear.  In addition, the proliferation risk and opposition to nuclear weapons carries quite some weight too in forming the stance on the nuclear industry.  Personally I'd prefer to use it for space exploration - its risks are irrelevant there and we can't rely on solar energy very well for interstellar travel."
GreenParty,2tq88t,scenecunt,3,Tue Jan 27 08:16:16 2015 UTC,Not quite. Nuclear plants take up to 20 years to build (the latest two plants in the UK took 17 years to build). We are against commissioning new plants as with that length of time we can transition to green energy. We will continue to support existing nuclear infrastructure for the time being.
GreenParty,2tq88t,silverionmox,4,Mon Jan 26 21:36:40 2015 UTC,"Well, yes. The odds of something happening are very small but if it does, the damage is unfathomable.    Of course this is an argument you surely have heard a thousand times before and surely it isn't entirely wrong, but to me something else is the main problem.    The nuclear waste created by this ever so safe power source is an ever increasing weight. It is so heavy, that in Germany, where I'm from, the salt mines, in which the waste is stored, started to collapse. Now, because it could come in touch with water and contaminate it doing so, the barrels have to be taken out. But where should they be moved to? This has caused a very controversial debate.    Now that, the storage problem, is to me the main reason why nuclear energy has to be halted or at least reconsidered."
GreenParty,2tq88t,silverionmox,5,Mon Jan 26 21:26:30 2015 UTC,"The odds of something happening are very small but if it does, the damage is unfathomable.   Including all meltdowns and everything, it is still the safest source of energy in terms of deaths/year.  Again, this is including Chernobyl and Fukushima (and Three Mile Island which didn't kill anyone or increase anyone's risk of cancer) and it includes the increased cancer risk caused by Chernobyl and Fukushima.   Now that, the storage problem, is to me the main reason why nuclear energy has to be halted or at least reconsidered.   I don't know about Germany, but the United States has some really superb locations to store nuclear waste, such as Yucca Mountain.  Maybe nuclear power isn't as good of an option for countries such as GB and Germany, which don't have large unpopulated deserts."

This is why nuclear energy is met with resistance. In my opinion, with incredible strides being made with solar, there's no need for the risk of going extinct. Consumption has to decline anyway, it's ludicrous to be using up more resources than there are at sustainable levels and an economic model of infinite economic growth on a finite planet with finite resources is incredibly immature, yet it's still the prevailing ideology of the human species."
GreenParty,2tq88t,auner01,2,Tue Jan 27 03:02:53 2015 UTC,"Consumption has to decline anyway, it's ludicrous to be using up more resources than there are at sustainable levels and an economic model of infinite economic growth on a finite planet with finite resources is incredibly immature, yet it's still the prevailing ideology of the human species.   In a couple hundred years we will essentially have unlimited energy through fusion.  That's a resource that will never* run out and with all that energy it will be really easy to recycle.  We only have to make it through about 1000 more years without destroying ourselves.    By the way, solar panels use up quite a bit of non-renewable resources themselves.  That's why they are still so expensive.  But you're right that incredible strides are being made with solar and it wouldn't take much more than some minor adjustments to our tax code to make them competitive with fossil fuels.  Right now with low gas prices would be a great time to institute a carbon tax.   If a cosmic impact event were to happen or some large scale earthquake or volcano scenario, and dozens or hundreds of nuclear power plants were to melt down, we would be looking at an extinction-level event.   That's something I hadn't considered.  I'll have to look into that.  Specifically what kind of impact would result in that kind of damage, whether it would result in meltdowns, and how much the meltdowns would add to the problem."
GreenParty,2tq88t,eaturbrainz,5,Tue Jan 27 03:25:33 2015 UTC,"OP, what specifically is anti-science? Do you disagree with any of the 5 points made? They call for expanded research and further development of technology. The main point that you may disagree with is that it calls for a halt to further development until there are democratic controls in place, rather than the current situation, with private industry essentially monitoring itself, and deciding for itself what, if any, controls should be in place. As has been shown over and over again, in the current system, great public harm has to be done first before controls are put in place, usually fought tooth and nail by the industries concerned."
GreenParty,2tq88t,eaturbrainz,9,Mon Jan 26 19:13:25 2015 UTC,"I don't have a problem with most of those points.  In fact no one does, and they are all largely already in place.  What I have a problem with is the perception they seem to have that nanotechnology is somehow more threatening than other forms of technology and the fact that they call for a ""halt to nanotechnology development"" until these guidelines are met.  Of course, I do have a problem with point 2, since it doesn't make any sense to have people without any understanding of the field to make decisions about which direction research should take.  A big part of my problem with it is this passage:   Like nuclear science and biotechnology, nanotechnology is being pursued largely outside of public debate, risking great harm and abuse in its use and application.   What?  Nanotechnology is not "" largely outside of public debate"" and it is not ""risking great harm and abuse in its use and application"".  I have no idea where they are getting this impression.  I'd estimate that 95% of nanotechnology research is published and publicly accessible.  The same thing pretty much goes for biotechnology, but I'm not an expert on that so I'd rather not get into a discussion on it.  Private companies are still regulated by OSHA and the EPA to prevent human or environmental contact with dangerous materials.  There are some nanomaterials that are carcinogens like asbestos, but they are monitored and contained with the same procedures.  There are no things like nano-bots or something that need some sort of special procedures."

GreenParty,2tq88t,cytopathic_effect,2,Tue Jan 27 07:24:58 2015 UTC,"Green resistance against new technologies is based on the precaution principle: we'd rather prevent shit from happening rather than having to clean it up afterwards (at a multitude of the cost and effort in addition to the damage). In addition, if you let an industry develop and have to change their practices afterwards it's much harder to make people trash their investments and habits.   but to call for a halt to the research is quite frankly absurd.   Well, they're not calling for a halt to research; they're calling for adequate precautions. This is already a preparation for legislative initiatives, so it should be seen as a normal licensing condition, and those likewise can be suspended or revoked - eventually - if the legal obligations aren't followed. Note that 3 is an expansion of research and 4 and 5 are just changing the priorities of the research, so they're hardly trying to shut it down."

GreenParty,2tq88t,PyschoCandy,2,Tue Jan 27 13:41:38 2015 UTC,And 3 out of 5 of their precautions are research. So in effect they just prioritize researching brakes before researching the gas pedal.
GreenParty,2tq88t,PyschoCandy,1 point,Tue Jan 27 14:37:58 2015 UTC,"I think the key word in this sections language is development. I understand research and development as two different stages. This does not appear to prohibit research of any kind, but rather the refinement of a product for mass production. While the material scientists that work for large companies very likely hope to exploit nanoparticle, I think it's not unreasonable that an FDA like examination should be required for new chemical compounds. At this stage, we do hardly and research on the toxicity or environmental impact of new materials before their launched. The value in a public debate would be to determine what marginal public good could sufficiently offset any proven negative health impacts."
GreenParty,2tq88t,autowikibot,1 point,Tue Jan 27 13:40:52 2015 UTC,"We do tons of research on the human and environmental impacts of new nanomaterials. The government has funded extensive research into the effects of carbon nanotubes but it takes years to find out exactly what levels of exposure are pose an acceptable risk. In the mean time, OSHA regulates it in the same way it regulates asbestos. I'm not sure what else the green party wants in this regard. I'm all for increasing research in these areas and for more oversight, but to call for a halt to development until it's implemented is really kind of crazy. There's no urgency on this and our current regulatory structure is already pretty good. I may be wrong but it really seems to me that the party hasn't really looked into the issue and is just letting their irrational fears drive them to some weird policy choices."

Look at how the media are trying to paint the Ferguson protesters in the States. People have even claimed that over here; anti-fox-hunting movements advocate violence.  Admittedly the ISIS argument is pushing it to the most extreme example, but we really can't pick and choose who we give these rights to and when. It's not a convenient position to take, but without rights being applied universally we run the risk of that legislation used to stifle free speech."
GreenParty,2tqt6x,Sergeant_Static,2,Tue Jan 27 01:51:29 2015 UTC,"There are a few people involved with the Ferguson protests who used or advocated violence, but that wasn't representative of those movements as a whole. Because of that, the distinction would be made based off of individual speech and behavior, and whether or not it in and of itself advocated violence, since the general movement did not.  ISIS and Al Queda, on the other hand, feature ideologies as a group that openly and unapologetically advocate violence in order to spread Islam. It's not just a few bad apples (as one would say about Islam by itself), it's what the two groups are about."
GreenParty,2tqt6x,Amckinstry,3,Tue Jan 27 02:05:00 2015 UTC,"Yes but sometimes it's difficult to draw that distinction. Maybe not with AlQ and ISIS, but certainly with other groups.  Who's to say when a few bad apples becomes the majority. Do you put an organisation on trial to find out?"

It's all a matter of legislation and enforcement: make the laws you want to collect the tax you want, then enforce those laws. The UK government is already doing this with lots of companies and individuals - why do you think Vodafone and companies like it are so special that they won't pay tax if there's a law saying they should?  As for changing the voting process, I know this has happened before in the UK: you changed your voting system three separate times in the 1800s.

GreenParty,2o7ife,VivatViridian,1 point,Thu Dec 4 23:16:55 2014 UTC,"Sounds like a democracy. Here in the U.S. the political parties have written themselves into the election laws so that in order to be able to vote in the first round, you have to be a member. I am an ""unaffiliated"" voter (in some states this is called ""decline to state."")  Only once the parties have determined their candidates (using a ballot that was paid for with my tax dollars, and without the parties paying any kind of fee to do so) do I get to vote on candidates. Since all the parties show up on the general election ballot, they do not necessarily need a 50%+1 majority to win. It's outrageous."
GreenParty,2o7ife,gregbard,1 point,Thu Dec 4 23:37:04 2014 UTC,"so that in order to be able to vote in the first round, you have to be a member.   I think we have an equivalent here. We call it ""pre-selection"". This is where each political party selects its candidate for an electorate. And, this is a private matter for those parties: they will select the candidates they feel best represent them. Only members of a party get to vote on who will be the party's candidates.   Then, when the election itself is announced, each party puts forward its pre-selected candidate for each electorate.   That's when the general voters get involved. They vote for the various candidates who have been pre-selected by each party.  So, have two stages:   Pre-selection of candidates by the members of political parties (or someone deciding to stand as an independent candidate). Voting on candidates by voters on the electoral roll, to determine who will be their representative in Parliament.   I'm not sure why non-members would need to get involved in selecting the parties' candidates - which sounds like the ""first round"" of voting you're referring to."
GreenParty,2o7ife,VivatViridian,1 point,Fri Dec 5 03:29:47 2014 UTC,"The significant issue is that in the general election (or ""final round"") all of the parties' chosen candidates are still on the ballot, not just the top two candidates. This very often results in a plurality winner, instead of a majority winner (i.e. 50%+1). It also eliminates the possibility that the top two candidates that voters should be choosing between are from the same party. So in other words, it portrays to the voters a false choice."

GreenParty,2o7ife,VivatViridian,1 point,Tue Dec 9 22:44:58 2014 UTC,"No you missed the point entirely. Twice over.  First of all, a valid elective system needs to permit for a run-off between two in order to guarantee that the resulting winner will have a 50%+1 majority. There is no mathematical way to guarantee that otherwise.  Secondly, the problem in most U.S. states (except California, Washington, and Louisiana) is that the final ballot is required to have one person from each party resulting in a ballot with one person from each party (more than two) and also resulting in the potential elimination of second place party candidates with more popular support than some who actually end up on the final ballot. For example a political party with few members (e.g. Communist Party) will have their first place candidate on the ballot, but the second place Democrat will not appear even though that person has 100 times more popular support.   My point is that elections aren't about parties, they are about persons. We need nonpartisan elections."
GreenParty,2o7ife,gregbard,1 point,Tue Dec 9 23:16:12 2014 UTC,"First of all, a valid elective system needs to permit for a run-off between two in order to guarantee that the resulting winner will have a 50%+1 majority.   You mean our elective system in Australia isn't valid? We get many candidates on our ballot papers - up to 10 or 12 sometimes. And we all vote for all of them using preferential voting: every candidate gets numbered from 1 to whatever. It's then up to the Electoral Commission to count our votes - including our preferences. And they keep removing candidates and re-distributing preferences until, yes, there are only two candidates left in the count and one gets 50% + 1. But that narrowing down to two candidates happens after we vote, not before.    the problem in most U.S. states (except California, Washington, and Louisiana) is that the final ballot is required to have one person from each party    Shouldn't that lead to having more than two candidates, though? I know that the Green Party is registered in the USA, so that means there should be at least three candidates on ballot papers: a Republican candidate, a Democrat candidate, and a Green candidate. And there should be even more if there are more parties registered (like the Communist Party you mentioned)."
GreenParty,2o7ife,VivatViridian,1 point,Tue Dec 9 23:49:00 2014 UTC,"Emil Post, a logician of the early 20th Century proved that logical systems that have three or more truth-values are unsound. Furthermore, Arrow's theorem proves that no elective system that presents the voter with three or more choices on a single ballot question is a mathematically sound system. Most of the time this won't make a big difference, and people do not tend to care much when you explain this to them, but you judge an elective system by how it handles the close votes. In some cases, the system will elect a candidate even though that person stands in the same mathematical relationship to other candidates. This means that it could literally be an arbitrary result caused by ballot order. This is completely unacceptable.  Simple majoritarianism (50%+1 requirement) is the only sound system for elections of individual offices (i.e. mayor, governor, president). In the case of elections for members of groups (i.e. council members, legislators, senators) there is more mathematical flexibility."

In some cases, the system will elect a candidate even though that person stands in the same mathematical relationship to other candidates.   Interesting that you should mention this. We've recently had a state election here in Victoria, Australia - and this included some very close results. However, there was no case which resulted in a tie (which is what I assume is meant by ""the same mathematical relationship to other candidates""). There was always a final majority - even if it came down to how 41 votes were distributed out of 38,000 votes in total.   Simple majoritarianism (50%+1 requirement) is the only sound system for elections of individual offices (i.e. mayor, governor, president).   We've been running a preferential (instant run-off) voting system here in Australia, with multiple candidates in each single-member electorate, literally from Day One, over a century ago. It doesn't seem to have hurt us any: we've always managed to elect a government and get a Prime Minister.  I dispute this idea that there should be only 2 candidates available for voting. This raises too many problems. The biggest ones are:   Who gets to decide who the two candidates are - and, more importantly, who they aren't? What about the voters who simply don't like one of those two options? Why aren't they entitled to have a choice?   The Greens are growing here in Australia because we allow multiple candidates in single-member elections. If we were restricted to only two candidates per election, we'd still be voting only Liberal versus Labor, and the Greens wouldn't exist."

It's also a very easy change to make, so it's a good first step to take, and why it's such a growing movement. It's also got benefits beyond helping to alleviate the two-party system. It discourages negative ads, for example, and there are many others.  I fully agree that single-member representation is definitely not ideal, and that proportional representation (I'm a fan of STV, which is essentially multi-seat RCV) is much better.  That said, some races are inherently single-seat (mayor, treasurer, governor, president, etc.). For those races, single-seat RCV might well be the best we can do."

The highest average based on both the real and fake votes, wins. This is fair since S and T are the same for every candidate.         Why do that?  ...there is a worry, which has been pointed out by score-voting critics. It is this:         ""Unknown lunatic wins"" nightmare: Suppose some crazy candidate whom almost nobody has ever heard of, runs for election. He convinces a small core group of fanatics to score him maximum. Ever other voter honestly gives him ""no opinion"" and hence his average score is very high, and he unexpectedly wins the election.           This could be alleviated by making the candidates final score == average score*number of people who voted for candidate.  Of course, the drawback of this particular method is that it reduces to ""first past the post"", if voters default to giving the highest score to a single candidate.

You currently cannot make a wind turbine without rare earth metals and the extraction process creates radioactive waste on a 1 to 1 basis. It is wind power's dirty little secret.  For a 2 megawatt turbine you need about 800lbs of neodynium and 130 lbs of dysporium. In 2012 the US added about 13131MW (about 3.5% of the grid) worth of turbines, they varied in size. That represents 4.9 -6.1 million pounds of rare earths and by extension 4.9-6.1 million lbs of associate waste.   For comparison nuclear created 4.4-5 million pounds of radioactive waste while providing about 20% of the grid in 2012. Nuclear had the added bonus of not chopping up swaths of birds."
GreenParty,2lsyzu,Tristanna,2,Tue Nov 11 03:08:59 2014 UTC,"Agreed.  On nuclear I would like to add that while I am not a big fan of today's fission plants (though I think having a few gen iv plants built to service big cities would be a great way to supplement wind/solar until we figure out effective ways to store the energy for up to a few weeks), I think we should be doing more research on fusion plants (cautiously, of course).  I think people underestimate how much raw materials (notably rare earth elements) are necessary to build enough wind/solar devices to provide 80%+ of global energy demand.  The environmental impact of that much mining would be significant (yes of course recycling would be important too but we haven't extracted nearly enough to build what would be necessary, not to mention the few billion poor people in places like Africa that will be getting computers and smartphones)."

It would help us greatly to invest in different types of reactors (thorium reactors? Pebble breeders? I'm forgetting which) that can use that waste as fuel, helping mitigate that risk.

Being deeply passionate about the natural beauty and health of our environment, we are deeply skeptical, for better or worse, of many things which run contrary to the natural order.  Nuclear power is NOT renewable.  It is dependent on a rare earth that whose mining is destructive to the environment, much of which is overseas anyhow.  Nuclear power is NOT clean energy.  The waste from Nuclear power is ridiculous in its negative environmental impact and will last longer than we can easily visualize.  Nuclear power is NOT economical.  It is propped up by government funding.  I recall recent repairs to a Nuclear power plant here in Ohio that they said would take 25 YEARS just to reach ""break even"" before they made money again.  Since then they've shut that plant down at least twice for more repairs.  Nuclear power is NOT safe.  The consequences of an accident are catastrophic.  We've seen several major accidents over the past few decades.  We know these things happen and do not feel the energy acquired is worth the risk.  GMO's are scary and cool at the same time.  I agree with earlier comments that a ""top down"" food structure is not a good economic model for the majority of citizens of the earth.  Perhaps if we could flip the ownership model, some Greens would flip on this issue.  Other Greens question whether we are really smart enough to second guess millions and millions of years of natural evolution to think we can do better.  Greed and Profit are clouding our ability to understand and forsee all of the possible consequences of releasing frankenstein organisms into the wild.  Here in Ohio a natural organism, the Emerald Ash Borer, has devastated our forests.  What might be the unforseen impact from some wild rice strain getting loose?  We acknowledge there are severe pressures on our planet from overpopulation and the only way we are going to support the human race is through advanced food production technology.  I think it is the alien and unknown nature of the new organisms combined with our cynicism about industrial and corporate motives that scare us.  Many of us Greens work in technology related fields and are not luddites.

Natural Selection has been around a while without causing any obvious harm and GMO's are simply an improved form of Natural Selection.   How about plants that make their own pesticides?  They are listed as organic because they don't need any additional pesticides added.  However, when you eat them, you are eating spoonfuls of pesticides, some of which we've never really eaten before because they only existed in organisms that were not part of our natural diet.  Is that a variation of Natural Selection or are we introducing something to our diet that maybe we shouldn't?  I don't know.  The problem is the creators of these things are seeing $$$$$$$$$$$$, and it is clouding their judgement.  If natural organisms introduced some place where they never existed before can destroy an ecosystem, how about organisms that never existed anywhere?  The thing is that we just don't know enough.  All we see are $$$$$$$$$$$.  Before we terraform the planet with super organisms with special powers we really need to tread very carefully.  Personally I'm not saying ""No GMO.  Ever.""  I'm arguing that putting money before common sense and careful study is dangerous and foolish.

GMOs have allowed millions of people to step out of starvation and the attitude that they are completely evil and need to be totally banned is ridiculous. Yes, they do need to be controlled and corporations shouldn't be let to run amuck with them. The argument to ban them completely though is like saying antibiotics should be totally banned because they are misused.   Same thing with nuclear energy.

So while it is certainly better than, say, coal, it isn't a permanent solution in the way that renewables (or maybe nuclear fusion) are and could be.  So even accepting that nuclear energy is a 'good' energy source, adopting it on a wide scale would mean sunk-costs into an energy infrastructure that will need to be drastically changed again in anywhere from 50-100 years.  We're already seeing a similar problem with coal/oil/NG, where some of the major energy players oppose any change to our energy grid simply because they are already very well-situated.    As for testing of GMO's; all of the testing that I am familiar with deals with potential adverse effects on human health.  The impacts that GMO's could have on complex ecosystems is yet to be seen; we simply don't know yet how the widespread adoption of a GMO could harm the environment.  Further, widespread adoption of GMO's could compound the problems that we are already seeing with monoculture.  Of course, plenty of greens oppose GMO's and nuclear energy just because of a gut feeling that neither one is 'natural.'  But there are some solid reasons for opposing either one."

GreenParty,2lsyzu,lllama,1 point,Mon Nov 10 00:36:37 2014 UTC,"Okay, I've been provoked. Here are my stances.  Nuclear Energy  We are well on our way to a world without fossil fuels. However, fossil fuels satisfy an important niche. They provide reliable power 24 hours a day, accounting for ""baseline"" energy. The only other things that can do that are nuclear and hydro. I personally prefer hydro, but there aren't very many places you can build a dam without destroying a vast ecosystem, so it can't be the sole solution. Meanwhile, we have a vast amount of fissile material sitting around, waiting to be misplaced or detonated above a foreign city. And the few commercial reactors we do have are all ancient designs that have far outlived their design lifespans, because the safer reactors intended to replace them were never built. We need to tear down all of these crumbling accidents-waiting-to happen and replace them with modern designs, which are inherently safe and/or able to burn the ""waste"" left behind by their predecessors, as well as promising new fuels like thorium.  Genetically Modified Organisms  Genetic engineering is the single most promising technology that humans have ever had access to. In the past, we would force two related organisms to breed in the hope that the random combination of their genes would yield a desirable result, and that worked pretty well for the most part (see chronic health problems in purebred dogs). Only in the past 40 years have we gained the power to manipulate specific genes. Anyone who has ever received a drug produced by modified bacteria (ie insulin) or a vaccine containing a modified virus (ie polio) owes their life to this. But now, the technology is cheap enough to apply to common foods. This concerns some people, so let's go down the standard list of arguments:   GMO foods are unhealthy. Possibly, but not necessarily. None of the ones created so far have been shown to be any less healthy than related foods produced by traditional breeding. And there is a vast amount of research going into modifying staple crops to make them more healthy (see golden rice). Monsanto is evil. Ya, they are. They force people who buy their seeds to agree not to replant them. They sue random farmers to make an example out of them. But they aren't the only company producing GMO crops. You can't patent nature. No, you certainly shouldn't be able to. All patents and copyrights on organisms, the chemicals they produce, genes, or processes for modifying genes should be thrown out. But this wouldn't preclude commercial GMOs. In fact, it would level the playing field. I don't care if other people buy it, I just want it labeled so I can avoid it. I don't care either way. If GMO labeling came up on my ballot again (see prop 37), I would leave it blank. But if/when the labels come, I will be sure to actively seek out GMOs. They encourage the use of herbicides. Yes, but most of the herbicides that GMO crops are engineered to resist are harmless to animals and patent-free. They encourage the use of insecticides. There is currently a lot of research into making plants naturally insect-resistant, so they will not require any insecticide at all. They encourage the use of fertilizers. No, you idiot. They encourage monoculture. Again, possibly, but not necessarily. There is some promising research into creating entirely new food crops out of plants that are otherwise unappetizing, inedible, or lacking in nutrients. (WIRED link, seriously interesting read)"

You don't replant hybrid seeds because they're less effective in future generations. And GMOs are just an extension of hybrid seeds.   They sue random farmers to make an example out of them.   No, they don't. Monsanto has never sued a farmer who didn't willfully and knowingly violate their patents."
GreenParty,2lsyzu,ThePrecariat,1 point,Mon Nov 10 22:01:35 2014 UTC,"So to summarise:   Nuclear is some kind of magical fairy land energy except in practise we have a bunch of old unsafe designs around, that produce unsafe materials that endanger us.   But we should be pro nuclear because it can produce base load power.  So why don't we live in the nuclear fairy land of safe nuclear energy?  We could look at the countries that are building ""safe"" designs right now, such as England, Finland, or China:  The only way to build them is through massive subsidies. Either by just being state owned, by guaranteeing to buy power at at least current prices for absurd periods of time, government loans for construction, and export subsidies (eg let France or China build it and they'll have a nice soft loan for you).  This is exacerbated by what's going in in regions adopting renewables. As you partially explain nuclear is extremely base load oriented. In Europe all the big energy companies have had to massively write down the value of their traditional power generating assets. When the wind is blowing in Denmark, your coal or nuclear plant in Germany has to to pay for the power it produces, not even the fact that coal is cheaper than it's been in a long time due to fracking in the US helps against that.   With more wind and solar coming online this problem will only get worse for base load power systems, and with natural gas prices coming down (which rather than providing constant base load like coal or nuclear can flexibly supplement the grid). Combine this with energy storage solutions coming out of the fantasy realm and you can see why no power company is proposing to pay by themselves for a nuclear reactor.  But at least these countries will have nice closed fuel cycle plants right? Well no, of course not. This is notoriously hard and what few plants exist in the world today to partially close the cycle are external, I don't know of any integrated design ever brought to market. And such plans are the worst safety offenders in the nuclear industry, wether it's leaking fissile materials or the variety of other chemicals and such used in this messy process.  Of course we could just build one of those integrated designs. At least try you know? Thorium sounds good lately. Well, chemically separating corrosive fluids pumped out of a live reactor with a lot higher requirements for criticality doesn't sound easy, but if you never try..!  Of course other such schemes have been tried. Fast breeder reactors were the Thorium reactors of their time, except people had to tell you about them on badly photocopied pieces of paper instead of the internet. They were build, some even ran (mostly experimental), some even still run (but not with a closed fuel cycle). People are still trying to build them, and governments still have to pay for it. The most ambitious one was build to completion early on in the 60s and then turned into a theme park before it ever opened.  Ok so it's expensive, but at least you'll have reliable base load power. Take the case of Belgium, a small country with little natural resources of it's own that was smart enough to build about 50% of it's electricity generating as nuclear.  Now they're making plans for rolling blackouts this winter because their nuclear plants are all offline due to safety concerns. One little crack in one plant somewhere typically means one little crack in all of them (since they're build to high standards they're amazingly alike). You could lessen the risk of that by building different types but this doesn't make it more economical (indeed this is why all countries now adding capacity are doing the exact same thing as Belgium). A coal plant built 5 years after the last will already be different of design, aside from the fact that it will be less prone to safety shutdowns to begin with. The same goes for wind turbines by the way. Do you have a strong believe that the vastly more complex modern designs are less prone to run into issues that will mandate a safety shutdown? Choose wisely.  But at least it's ""green"" right? A lot greener than coal, I'll grant you that. But a lot greener than, let's say natural gas? You mentioned the environmental impact of a hydro dam.. ever been to a uranium mine? With ore quality going down by some estimations nuclear plants using uranium derived from low quality ore are already exceeding the CO2 output of a gas powered plant.  I'm skeptical of those numbers, and you should be too. I'm sure newer plants are also more efficient. But don't pretend nuclear is zero emissions.  Nuclear is a risky choice, and it is not cheap at the moment. These is some potential that future innovation will make it cheaper.  The same goes for Green energy, except, in my view it has a better track records. It has already achieved a rate of innovation and implementation far beyond what the naysayers ever held possible. The problems of baseload power can be solved by known technology (essentially a better grid is all it takes), but has the potential to be solved much cheaper with innovative storage.  In the pro-nuclear side not only tends to ignore all these points, and then try to smear the alternatives. Not just some intertard commenters but the actual people running the industry. With these people at the helm of implementing any nuclear strategy, don't expect much Green support.  I could make a whole same reply about GMOs, but it comes down to the same. The theoretical benefits are plenty, but what we ended up with in practice has nothing to do with that (e.g. more pesticide use instead of less). Then combine this with exaggerated self importance of the people behind it, and the smearing of alternatives."

But you can't be a feminist unless you believe the feminist narrative, of patriarchal oppression of women, and preference for men.  But different groups of feminism are so fragmented and contradictory that in reality, the only thing they have in common is that they thing women are always worse off than men.  It's a political group, and it has it's own agenda. And I believe groups who use the idea of equality to push their own political agendas don't actually help to bring about equality.

That's exactly why I identify with feminism. Like someone earlier in this thread said, if we let those people be the face of feminism then it's only harmful to gender equality as a whole.   I understand your argument and I agree with its sentiment but I think you're only doing more harm than good for gender equality."

Well you've got the editor if Ms. Magazine saying:   “I feel that ‘man-hating’ is an honourable and viable political act”  – Robin Morgan, Ms. Magazine Editor   Andrea Dworkin saying:   “I want to see a man beaten to a bloody pulp with a high-heel shoved in his mouth, like an apple in the mouth of a pig.” — Andrea Dworkin   Marilyn French saying:   “All men are rapists and that’s all they are” — Marilyn French   And Germaine Greer saying:   “Probably the only place where a man can feel really secure is in a maximum security prison, except for the imminent threat of release.” — Germaine Greer.   I mean these are feminists, aren't they? And what exactly do you see as the:   fundamental beliefs of the movement    Because as far as I can see, there is no agreed set of ideas which constitute feminism.  You said that basically anything goes as long as you're for gender equality, but a lot of people seem to disagree with that.  It's all very difficult to judge you see. Because on the one hand, you have people like you and I who genuinely want gender equality.  The problem as I see it is that you believe the only thing which can actually bring about gender equality is a movement which is led by people who say genuinely hideous things, which only serve to hinder progress towards a completely equal society.  A movement which fails utterly to deal with issues which only affect males.  A movement which, for the most part, doesn't allow dissent and disagreement; but won't accept that any other movement can actually be about equality.   I understand your argument and I agree with its sentiment   I'm glad we've got some mutual understanding here. I'd very much like to hear if I've swayed you in your opinion that gender equality and feminism are one and the same; and my contention that they are't intrinsically linked.  To go over my position once more, I believe in gender equality. I do not want to be a feminist, because feminism has the following flaws:  It has a history of ignoring mens issues  Feminism is a movement which accepts hate speech directed towards men  I do not agree with a large number of feminist theories  I do not believe that feminism can actually achieve gender equality, because of its prejudice in favor of women"

GreenParty,2lqh9r,DanceExMachina,2,Sun Nov 9 14:13:22 2014 UTC,"thanks  I see your point and that's fair enough, but specifically saying ""I'm not comfortable calling myself a feminist"" will suggest to a lot of people that you have reservations about supporting women's rights. Since ""I believe there should be gender equality"" is a very common definition of feminism, one way of saying this might be ""I'm a feminist in that I support equality of all genders"". That is only a tiny bit longer than ""I support equal rights for all genders"", without alienating people (the feminists will almost all agree with your definition, and the non-feminists will be able to see the terms by which you've defined your feminism, and not get the wrong idea about your beliefs).  I mean, I assume you believe in equal rights based on race and ethnicity, right? If you said ""I don't want to call myself anti-racist, but I support equality of races"", people would think ""why doesn't he want to call himself anti-racist? Why is he trying to distance himself from anti-racists?"""

We already have a gazillion creative solutions.  Here is a rough draft of my proposal. Please feel free to critique it and tear it apart if you must. Let us learn together and come up with a step-by-step outline of how we go from the current state of affairs to a Whole New Way of Living rooted in Love and Wisdom.   The Presidency is rigged. The Governorships and the Senate are hard but not impossible to win. The City Councils, the Mayorship, the State Senate and the State Assembly and the House of Representatives are easy to win.   We must work from the bottom up. We start from where we live. We must take charge of our own city/town/village and we show the world what is possible.  For instance, here in NYC, about 72% of eligible voters don't vote in the NYC Mayoral election. And at least 2/3 of them are progressive.  5 million New Yorkers are eligible to vote.  Only 1 million usually vote (20% of eligible voters).  The mayorship is usually won with less than 800,000 votes.  We start by creating a Majority Voting Bloc.  This means that all we have to do is to inspire just 1 million individuals from the 4 million to vote together for the candidates who are best for the People. This Voting Bloc will enable us to win the Mayorship, the City Council, the State Senate, the State Assembly and the House of Representatives.  Then we will be able to repeal laws that do not serve the People and enact laws that do.  Then we will be in a better position to finally implement the gazillion wonderful creative solutions we already have without impediment.  Other cities/towns/villages of the world will be inspired to do the same.  In time, we will be in a position to win the Governorships and the US Senate and then finally the Presidency after we change the election laws.  Then from there we can more easily usher in a Whole New Way of Living rooted in True Love and Wisdom.  i am turning around and mentoring on average about 10 new uninformed/misinformed people every week.

GreenParty,2ldeqe,tedzeppelin93,5,Thu Nov 6 00:42:20 2014 UTC,"Sorry for the huge rant, but...  The problem with this is in how legislatures are organized.   For executive positions, yes, vote for the candidate that you agree with the most. Executive positions are conducive to the personal opinions and positions of the officeholder.   However, if 200 years of a liberal partisan republic have taught us anything (using liberal and republic as PoliSci terms, not ideologies) it is that individual citizens have little effect on the legislature, and individual legislators have little effect on their party.   Parties do not work as associations of people with similar ideologies. Parties work as organizations that create single, cohesive platforms, that they expect their members to support (and, with the use of whips, caucuses, distributive campaign funding, etc, they are able to get the Party to adhere to the platform.)   You know that old USSR ""party line"" with their Democratic Centralism? Well, sorry to say it, but that's how it works in the United States as well, we merely allow multiple parties to exist.   So, you really can't vote for the people that represent your views regardless of party, at least not with any efficacy.   There are swing votes in the Senate and the House, however, the real influence those legislators have is using their unreliability to the Party to influence the direction of the Party. Sadly, these legislators are the exact people that the Party will refrain from incorporating heavily. (Look at the big, important committees. You won't find many ""mavericks"" there. You will find ""party line"" politicians.)  The only significant way to, for example, redirect the Democratic Party would be to elect a significant number of Greens, SAs, and other libertarian-left Parties, into government as Democrats. This is how most of the party realignments in US history have occurred (and roughly how Coalition systems occur in the UK, by directing the Coalition platform rather than the Party platform.)  The current political climate (and the structure of the US, FPTP system) just makes the ""personal opinion, not party affiliation"" strategy a complete dead end.   The only real solutions here are to play the game within the 2 party system, or significantly structurally change the US legislative and elective processes.   (Sorry for seeming so pessimistic, but it really does say something when harsh realism seems to be so pessimistic.)"
