techsupport,3e3clo,Not_dr_phil,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:17:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, it may be a firmware limitation. Adding rules to your router means it looks at a packet and sees whether any rules apply to it. The more rules, the more CPU cycles on the router necessary, so this slows down the router. The manufacturer likely imposed an arbitrary limit to prevent end users from significantly slowing down the basic function of the router."
techsupport,3e3clo,useratlocalhost,2,Tue Jul 21 17:33:20 2015 UTC,Does the router have an DMZ or UPnP mode?
techsupport,3e3clo,OSPFv3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:17:50 2015 UTC,"Yes to both. From what I read DMZ means that all ports are forwarded for that IP, so I put my Xbox in there. Problem is is that occasionally it will drop from 40 megabits to 1 megabit per second occasionally it will not work.  Not sure what upnp is though, but I do remember seeing it"
techsupport,3e3clo,OSPFv3,3,Tue Jul 21 18:57:39 2015 UTC,UPnP is a feature that allows the xbox to port forward itself.  I highly suggest you replace that combo unit with a standalone modem and get a decent router. Sounds like its causing you many issues related to poor design choices.
techsupport,3e3clo,thecal714,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:59:29 2015 UTC,"UPnP mode would be the way to go for this one. It's almost mandatory for XBL, but I'm surprised that it's not on be default, as it is with most consumer-grade routers."

techsupport,3e3pj1,redheadfever,2,Tue Jul 21 18:45:10 2015 UTC,"Firstly, that's not a surge protector it's a UPS-- it started beeping likely because the power went out in your house, not the other way around. I'm assuming you meant the breaker in your house switched, yes? If so it's possible that the breaker your room is on is being overloaded and maybe causing the system to brown out.  No you're computer is fine for current games.   I can't say i'm sure why changing the settings didn't affect the FPS-- that seems very odd. Perhaps try a different game? I've heard that the witcher has been having performance issues with the latest patch."
techsupport,3e3pj1,Pyrepenol,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:00:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for answering my questions. I have a few more if you don't mind.   You know better than I, but isn't it a UPS and surge protector? What would you suggest instead of the one I have? Witcher 3 is the only game I own. Do you know how I could raise the FPS? Right now I'm lucky if I get 30fps. What is the ideal fps? Do you know what setting I should play on? Is Ultra too high? Do you know why my computer froze about 20-30 minutes into play? Do most people use a controller or keyboard for this type of game?"
techsupport,3e3pj1,Pyrepenol,2,Tue Jul 21 19:05:39 2015 UTC,"-A UPS is indeed a surge protector but it has some limitations normal surge protectors don't have. Your UPS is rated at 255 watts-- while your computer's power supply is rated at likely much much higher than that, which would explain the brownouts (aka loss of power).  -In general, the golden number for FPS is 60, some people claim you can't see the difference past that but personally I like my games to run at around 85 or so. I'd say below 25 is unplayable, 30-45 is noticeably bad, and 45+ is generally fine.  -Ultra is fine as long as the FPS doesn't dip too low.   -For third-person games I absolutely prefer a controller. It's much more natural."
techsupport,3e3pj1,Enjoiissweet,2,Tue Jul 21 19:20:45 2015 UTC,"Turn off hairworks and nvidia game features. Make sure you don't have the game capped to 30 fps.   Your pc is above what you need  to play W3 but your gpu (gtx 760) was mid range at launch and a rebadged card from the previous generation.   You won't be able to run the game at 60 fps with all of the settings maxed. Make sure you're not overloading the vram with ultra textures.  Nvidia has a guide on their website that goes over each graphic option if you're not familiar with things like AO, tessellation, AA, AF and how each setting will change performance.   If you have Geforce Experience installed it does the same thing to a lesser extent.  If a controller is more comfortable by all means plug one in and go for it. If you ever play multiplayer fps games m+kb is definitely the way to go.   A mix of high/medium settings should net you a solid 60fps and will look better than either console version."
techsupport,3e3pj1,Enjoiissweet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:53:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks for answering my questions.    I did have it capped at 30fps, so that needed to be corrected.  I took off the hairworks features, turned down shadow quality and foliage visibility.  I'm hovering around 35-50fps. Is that doable or is that shit? It looks good to me however I'm unsure how this would look compared to a console."
techsupport,3e3pj1,Enjoiissweet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:27:32 2015 UTC,"What fps you find an enjoyable experience is subjective though the lowest I'd go is 60fps. You may appreciate visual fidelity more so than high fps.   For comparison consoles are running on a mix of low/medium at a 30fps hard cap with high textures.  After hairworks I would turn off antialiasing, then drop AO, followed by shadows. I'm personally a stickler for view distance.   Unfortunately I couldn't give you a list that says where your options should be to reach 60fps as PC has too many variables and it's likely something you'll have to tinker with.   My best advice (if you don't know already) is to learn what each setting does individually as it will help you tailor the game to how you'd like to play it.   Now I'm not saying you should do this, however, if you pick up more PC games and find that you want more performance you're in a really good spot to upgrade the GPU to something with some more horsepower.  All that aside here is a link for nvidias guide to graphics for W3. Its a bit lengthy but very informative.   Guide"
