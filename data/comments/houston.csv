An ex-friend's mom (50-60s) asked me where I'm from, I told her I'm mixed, she then said - with no hesitation - I should say ""I'm white"" and shouldn't say I'm Asian anything. As I can ""pass as white."" Lady, I am both. I am not going to lie about my heritage, my ethnicity because YOU feel uncomfortable."
houston,3e16tx,HeartsBlood,17,Tue Jul 21 13:59:33 2015 UTC,That's awesome. I'm mixed with black and white but I'm not white passing at all. I've never had any confrontations about my biracial-ness but there has been many many times that I feel people are uncomfortable or talking about me.
houston,3e16tx,JAT621,5,Tue Jul 21 14:37:01 2015 UTC,"Yes!! I understand you. :) That's something I don't get to say everyday! Thank you for that.  I've been around people that have said ""you're the only person I know that has [enter race] friends."" In my early 20s, I couldn't help but look at them with a wtf face, my reaction was ""why then hell not?! What does that even mean?"" but then realized they never got to experience talking and belonging to multiple races and multiple cultures and heritages like we do (we were born in it after all).   They happened to grow up only around people that look like them; act like them; have a uniform/understood culture around them and understandably impress that on to their children/friends. They don't realize that some of what they say is racist because they themselves just don't understand what racism really is. Obviously, there are very cut-throat racist out there - a lot of them; but I personally see racism as a spectrum, all of it very wrong, but there are plenty that look at us differently/ uncomfortably because they do not ""understand"" - quite yet. ;)  this all comes from my pov. I know there are plenty of non bi-racial people who have been through similar situations as me and have come to the same conclusion as I did as they got to grow up with curiosity or diversity. I'm just reflecting on my time as I grew up in South Korea at a time where there where not many mixed people."

So sad the discrimination and ignorance is still there for a lot of people whom live here.     Major props for recognizing both of your heritages. My younger brother, of the same mix as I, struggles with this and only proclaims being Asian because of pressure from his friends."
houston,3e16tx,Mighty_Mutt,6,Tue Jul 21 16:18:18 2015 UTC,"It took me a long while to get to this point. I share in the hopes it brings some light.  I had a lot of frustrations and unfortunately a lot of hatred with my American ""white"" side (father is 4th gen American-Irish) and vise versa with the Korean heritage I grew up in (father remarried a Korean women when I was 2). My Korean mom moved to American when she married my dad, leaving a lot behind and carrying a lot of baggage... There were very dark periods in my parent's marriage where in some fights my mom and dad start talking about how she's moving back to Korea; she would yell at my dad that I was his daughter because of my skin color (white) and my sister (tan) was ""her daughter."" There were moments in my life where my mom would break down in tears saying that I would always have more advantages, more opportunities in life than my sister because I looked more white. I ended up hating what I was because of what she said and my dad, well he didn't ""understand it."" Because he didn't see his children as bi-racial, which is a fault in a way.  Unfortunately and fortunately, I no longer speak with my mom... but I can't deny the racial prejudice she had to go through being married to my white dad, living in America where mixed marriages are frowned upon or made a spectacle of, where the assumption that my mom married my dad because of money, to get out of poverty, or because she was a prostitute. I cant even tell you how many times I've been asked if my family was in the military... or when people look down on my mom because she married a white person and not someone Korean. I empathize with her a lot and all I can say was I wish she didn't have to feel that way. I wish she broke away from all that pressure that weighed her down that made my sister and I have a very uncomfortable relationship about who we were and who we are to each other. It really divided us...   I really hope one day you find that balance with your beautiful and amazing heritages and your family...It is there. You may have to create it, but it is possible."

In cases like the ones the OP linked to, the dissenter has clearly decided that (s)he has some special vantage point that can see wrongness that the rest of us idiots simply cannot see. They'd adamantly maintain that they've looked at both sides and made a rational decision.  Similarly, to take an easy example, one could make the case that abolitionists were not looking at both sides. How could they value the interests of one small ""well cared for"" subgroup more highly than the economic health of the nation? They looked at things from a very closed-minded way, tried to force their ideological beliefs on our society and we ended up better off for it.  Bottom line: ""look at both sides"" is easy to say and it's quite effective providing that the person is not already blinded to alternative points of view."

It was tough in grade school because kids have no filter.  I went to an all boys high school in Houston and I faced racism from day one there, also.  I don't think I carry around any resentment anymore, but it did cause me to shut down at times.  Just as an observation, it's more common now and the opinion of narrow minded people means less to me as time goes by.  Hang in there, don't let society reduce what you have if it is special."

However if it was an Asian chick with a white guy nothing would be said and the magazine would still be on display. About a 3 years ago, A LOT of commercials on TV were white guy/Asian chick not a single headline or outrage about the coupling. But hey a black guy with a white women with kids and shit hits the fan(cereal commercial).  Asian/White is actually the biggest interracial marriages according to statistics but do you hear a word about it with these so called I'm against interracial marriage bigots? Nope nothing. Their just against black/white mixing, if they were actually against interracial mixing maybe somewhere deep deep deep down in my ape brain I could at least understand where their coming from but its just disingenuous.  On the actually guy on the cover he looks like a well to do brother that racist claim is ""one of the good blacks"". At least that is the lie they toss around, but at the end of the day hes still black and shouldn't be with a white women in their dumb ass minds."

But I do agree that the specific races and sexes matter a whole damned lot to people. Lots of slave owners had sex with their female slaves, but if a black man had sex with a white woman, even decades after slavery had ended, it was obviously ""rape.""

It's highly unlikely that they lied but I'm not just going to 100% believe what they said just because they said it. It'd be different if they made the email he sent public (not sure what the legality of this would be). But right now it's just one editor's word. I need more than that.

houston,3e2umt,Isorg,2,Tue Jul 21 16:10:44 2015 UTC,"I agree. You know it is quite interesting because as much as some city officials are trying to turn our city green... our city is far from being green friendly. A lot of neighborhoods lack the essentials for becoming green. For instance, in my neighborhood, there are so many gated communities being built and one essential green/LEED ideas for neighborhoods is trying to incorporate mixed occupancies.. something that is not happening.   Also, he touches on one of the fundamental problems we have regarding our city and bike riding and that is showers. As professionals, we are required to show up presentable and clean to our place of employment.  Riding a bike in a month like July or August would imply that you will most likely sweat through your clothes and arrive to work with BO and sweaty/messy clothes. If most places of employment offered showers to their employees I think many people would perhaps consider riding to work but the reality of this happening is close to null.  Next and most importantly... driving culture in our city. For daily commuting, honestly, it seems almost like a death wish trying to bike to work. For me, it would mean trying to get from Spring Branch to Greenway plaza. Have you seen how fast people drive on Memorial in the mornings? Crazy fast. I don't think many people have the patience, driving education, and the manners to share the road with bike riders."
houston,3e2umt,Oprah_Windfury_,3,Tue Jul 21 17:33:05 2015 UTC,Houston currently requires office buildings to have 2.5 parking space for each 1000sf gross floor area. The city can update the ordinance to include shower and preferred parking space for vanpool/carpool as a way to reduce the amount of parking space required. This is a more realistic way to become green city.
houston,3e2umt,boojel,2,Tue Jul 21 18:59:42 2015 UTC,"I don't think we should just surrender to not being a green city. Those all sound like reasons we should be making an effort.

houston,3e2umt,Isorg,3,Tue Jul 21 19:22:50 2015 UTC,"If we have an infrastructure in place to allow people alternatives to driving, especially those who don't choose to live so far from work, it helps everyone. People who would rather live closer and bike can do that, and there will be less cars on the road causing traffic for people who want to live further out and drive. Putting the infrastructure in place doesn't mean you have to bike, you can still drive, and you'll still benefit from it. I completely understand that many Houstonians have no interest in any other way than driving. But there are tons of people who are entwined on car culture out of necessity, not choice. We need the infrastructure. It's a win for everyone. I don't think we should just accept that we all have to drive as traffic gets worse by the day.  Edit: I for one am wrapped up in car culture and I resent it. I like to drive, but I don't like having to drive EVERY time I leave my house. When I'm going 3/4 of a mile for some milk or take-out, I'd really like to be able to hop on my bike. Especially with the drivers here. To go get some milk I have to accept that some idiot might pull out in front of me and cause an accident with their kid in the backseat, etc, etc. Biking is so much less stressful"

Backpack with change if clothes and some baby wipes. Go to stall, get naked, wipe down with paper towels, dry hair if you have longer hair. Take baby shower bath. Brush hair if you have it. Put work clothes on and your good to go. People didn't believe that I rode my bike in, despite rolling it over to my desk. They were like, but you're not sweaty. And I have longer hair. It's totally doable and despite it being the peak of summer, I enjoyed it and had better days than when I was driving.

Lots of college kids/prison guards like everyone else has said.  Really nice place if you like the outdoors.  A lot of intersections are rough on low cars but driving isn't a hassle and the roads are usually light-traffic. I got used to driving to Houston to have fun - it's not too bad in the evening.

I don't think the hype is going to last long though, we weren't blown away or anything by the food, it was all good but nothing exceptional.   The cocktail menu really doesn't fit the concept, all the food is sourced from Texas (or the gulf) so you would think the cocktails would be similarly themed and not your usual variants of Moscow Mules, Dark & Stormy's and Paloma's so I'd recommend sticking to wine."

In Houston, a police officer cannot arrest anyone without first getting authorization from an assistant district attorney. Assuming the mother was within ""eye sight of the children"" the entire time, how did she not see the police officers go up to her children and talk with them for however long.   My guess is, she left them at the food court out of eye sight and was arrested when she came back since this is illegal under the Texas Family Code 22.041.    Sec. 22.041.  ABANDONING OR ENDANGERING CHILD.  (a)  In this section, ""abandon"" means to leave a child in any place without providing reasonable and necessary care for the child, under circumstances under which no reasonable, similarly situated adult would leave a child of that age and ability.  (b)  A person commits an offense if, having custody, care, or control of a child younger than 15 years, he intentionally abandons the child in any place under circumstances that expose the child to an unreasonable risk of harm.    Maybe I'm crazy here, but I would say leaving a 6 year old to watch a 2 year old in a food court where you don't even know that they are in police supervision could be considered leaving them in a situation of unreasonable risk."

This goes to explain why you hear two very different types of stories about CPS on local news: CPS is overly involved and takes away kids in what appears to be a normal situation (with poverty being the issue) or CPS completely ignores a child in their care who ends up dead/abused.   Let's get some things straight:  A CPS caseworker may be a witness in a criminal investigation or conduct an investigation into the family, but they do not ""charge"" anyone in the criminal sense. That is the districy attorney.    A caseworker after investigation DOES submit an affidavit alleging abuse/neglect when a child is taken from a family in order to get temporary managing conservatorship, but again they are not the ones charging or filing anything. In Harris County, they are represented by the Harris County Attorney's Office (this is how it sounds--the county attorney's office represents CPS as a client). But these proceedings occur in civil family court, not criminal court.   Judges absolutely do challenge CPS. CPS is not some massive entity that takes on a nondescript terrifying conglomerate form in court. It takes the form of a single individual caseworker for each case, who in the eyes of the judges are just another party to the case. If you think judges are afraid of caseworkers, you're kidding. Judges while elected, care more about the attorneys in their courtroom than CPS--because guess what? CPS doesnt donate to their campaign or keep them on the bench--attorneys in private practice do. And guess what..judges will still do what they want regardless.   The system is confusing no need to stir the pot with more senseless tripe.

houston,3dya2h,Ravid32,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:20:49 2015 UTC,"What part of ""massive organization"" with ""mismanagement, miscommunication, and mistakes"" that have ""devastating impacts"" is being an apologist?  Just because I am not ranting it doesn't mean I am a cheerleader or an apologist for the system. Bottom line is simple, CPS is a very broken system designed more towards keeping children IN the system than by helping to reunite and counsel families. The system sucks, period. But guess what? Your contention that CPS is some powerful, impenetrable force to be reckoned with that even the cops and judges are shakin' in their boots is simply untrue."

You don't know if the kids were being rambunctious, or if they were actually out of her sight, or if someone was just being an instigator as is wholly possible, or if someone was worrying way too much. You don't know. All we can do now, all we should be doing is wishing the best for this woman and her children, so that ultimately justice will prevail. Because reckless or not losing your job and children is a steep price to pay for something so minor, not even considering that events like these do nothing to help the kids in the situation (I promise you that CPS is really no better than a shitty mother). And, this is just me addressing the issue from a human perspective. I haven't even touched the multiple systems in place and the evidence that proves that bringing the police and government into black lives is almost always harmful and results in situations like these because people always assume the worst, place the severest punishments, and dehumanize the victim and their problems, like currently."
houston,3dya2h,Krunt,6,Tue Jul 21 13:00:21 2015 UTC,You should have called it 'rishsplaining.'  Whitesplaning is racist and innaccurate.

(Not: he said something offensive to me now I'm not going to listen to anything he said!! Because currently, that's the vibe you're giving off.)"
houston,3dya2h,rianeiru,2,Mon Jul 20 22:04:10 2015 UTC,"well she could be a bad parent, but we don't really know.  weather or not she gets the benefit of the doubt is where the racism comes in."
houston,3dya2h,rianeiru,-1,Mon Jul 20 19:10:48 2015 UTC,"Whitesplaining? Hey, go fuck yourself dude. By your logic we shouldn't have a legal system at all. I can't possibly judge someone for raping and murdering people without having their education, family, children, financial, and legal issues. Oh wait, I can. She left her kids unsupervised for long enough that someone was able to recognize there was nobody watching them, call the police, wait for the police to show up, and the police were able to ascertain the same thing. The kids were 6 and 2, and the article says they seemed scared and were crying. If she was actually supervising her children, clearly at some point in all that she would have thought to intervene. I don't care what race I am, those actions are not acceptable."
houston,3dya2h,rianeiru,9,Tue Jul 21 08:49:26 2015 UTC,"It's entirely possible that her kids were making a scene and couldn't handle being 30ft away from mom.  We literally know nothing about the details of what happened.  If the kids are like some of the hellraisers I've seen in public, I'll give the benefit of the doubt to the authorities, thanks."
houston,3dya2h,SeaRavenTX,37,Mon Jul 20 17:18:23 2015 UTC,"Wait, you can call the cops on people for having bratty kids and not keeping them right next to them at all times now? That's awesome, I'm going to start doing that every time I see some kid running around like a jackass in the aisle at Kroger while their mom stands ten feet away picking out dinner. /s"
houston,3dya2h,professorbooty25,5,Mon Jul 20 17:44:16 2015 UTC,"Just someone who knows that even if they were screaming and running around while their mom ignored them, it still wouldn't be a crime unless she straight up left them there, or if they were asked to leave and she refused."
houston,3dya2h,SeaRavenTX,5,Mon Jul 20 17:47:34 2015 UTC,"Wasn't sure why you're harping on that point, so I checked your history for context to see if you were asking other people that. Saw your /r/childfree post. Seriously, is that what this is about?    No, I'm not a parent, don't want to be a parent, don't even really like kids that much, and I hate screaming kids and crying babies in public. I just don't think it's right to arrest someone for something that isn't actually illegal, no matter how annoying it is. So you can shelve whatever ""rabid parents defend irresponsible single mom for letting her hellspawn terrorize the public"" narrative you're spinning."
houston,3dya2h,rayzorium,-1,Mon Jul 20 18:02:59 2015 UTC,"It is illegal to leave children unsupervised especially when they may be in danger or causing a disturbance.  The law is there for their protection.  I don't know why you keep saying it's illegal to dump your 2 year old and 6 year old babysitter somewhere in public while you go do something.  It doesn't matter if she is interviewing for a job or meeting a lover.  A lot can happen to those kids that could POSSIBLY endanger their safety.  Imagine if these kids were abducted and HPD had to pull resources, even for a day, to investigate and sweep an entire area.  Do you know how much money that would cost?  It's better this way: follow the law, let the judge decide."
houston,3dya2h,professorbooty25,3,Mon Jul 20 18:08:28 2015 UTC,"I think you're just trying to win an argument at this point. Not really caring that 30 feet is just out of arms reach, well within ear shot, and easily can still be seen."
houston,3dya2h,zeppoleon,-2,Mon Jul 20 18:30:55 2015 UTC,"Nope, I'm not just trying to win an argument.  I don't think it's responsible to leave your kids unattended and I think parents particularly are inconsiderate.  Nobody wants to hear your unattended 2 year old bawl her eyes out while you go do something.  I'm sure there is more to this story.  Kids without any supervision means bystanders are worried and they may have been wandering around.  I get why the cops brought her in to talk to the judge and a lot of people here are confused by that."
houston,3dya2h,couldnt_careless,3,Mon Jul 20 18:40:35 2015 UTC,"There is a bold line between being irresponsible and deserving to go to jail. Interesting that your example of the ""other side of the story"" was the kids just being an annoyance."
houston,3dya2h,pouponstoops,2,Mon Jul 20 19:02:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, parents and their kids suck. They ruin everything. But it really is just a minor annoyance. Not something to arrest people over. 30 feet is just a few steps away. It's not unreasonable when I go to the beach with my friends that have kids, for the kids to be 30+ feet away. Hundreds of kids are away from their parents then. Why is the mall different."

houston,3dya2h,miked1be,-11,Tue Jul 21 05:22:46 2015 UTC,That is arguable.
houston,3dya2h,SeaRavenTX,8,Mon Jul 20 17:48:37 2015 UTC,Not according to the judge.
houston,3dya2h,politicize-me,-10,Mon Jul 20 17:50:02 2015 UTC,"The judge didn't release her because the children were being supervised.  The judge probably released her because she was interviewing for a job and realized going through with incarceration would do more harm than good.  The law that is there, in place, is there for a reason.  It's not up to cops to interpret the law, it is their job to enforce it with reasonable jurisprudence."
houston,3dya2h,miked1be,4,Mon Jul 20 17:51:01 2015 UTC,Not only did the judge release her but released her and returned custody of her children to her.  That's a pretty important factor here.
houston,3dya2h,kylejack,-3,Mon Jul 20 17:55:42 2015 UTC,"The only duty of the police is to enforce the LAW.  Whether or not he feels prosecution is substantiated is up to the judge, that's why we separate them."

houston,3dya2h,kylejack,-1,Mon Jul 20 20:43:14 2015 UTC,"Your RANDOM capitalization usage really helps sell your point.  Thing is, it's arguable that the police really needed to go as far as arresting her or simply ask a few questions and move on or maybe submit the case to CPS.  We don't know, you're making a bunch of assumptions here like the judge only releasing her because she had a job interview, the point I was making with the kids is that the judge obviously didn't feel the need for her to be in custody or to be separated from her children.  If my kid has a bruise on his leg should the police arrest me just in case so the judge can make the final call?  There are ways to handle things that don't involve full arrest in certain situations and sometimes the police overstep their boundaries.  Acting like this was definitely a justified arrest is a huge assumption."
houston,3dya2h,neal-page,2,Mon Jul 20 20:44:51 2015 UTC,We literally know nothing about the details of what happened.  The judge didn't release her because the children were being supervised.

Also, to the really annoying implicit statement you're making with your comment that portraying black people anything other than negative, or even portraying them at all, is ""Tumblr"". Can't we, not only as an online community, but as Houstonians (from one of the most diverse cities in the world) not, make such childish statements about discussions on race and character.

I associate it with people who circlejerk around their inability to be well-adjusted adults or understand basic social constructs and why they are there.  It is my opinion that the kids probably weren't too happy about mom being X number of feet away and she was not directly supervising them.  It has nothing to do with race and the fact that you ARE hypersensitive to race, ironically, makes you part of the cliche and living parody, that is Tumblr.  TL;DR I never brought race into this issue and thus, you exposed your own racial driven resentment to people outside your own race.  Double irony."

Also, never said anything about resentment, nor my race, nor yours. In fact, I personally asked you to take race out of the picture when evaluating this. (I love it when people make arguments easy.)

Always expect the unexpected, drive defensively and be aware of your surroundings at all times, as you approach a lighted intersection glance at the pedestrian signals to see how long you have and as you get closer check to make sure the intersection is clear on both sides. If you hear a siren, slow down, identify where it is and if behind you pull over if need be and it is safe to do so.

People in the suburbs do not want poor inner-city minorities to have the ability to get on a train and conveniently get to richer neighborhoods.  Homeowners associations will complain ""think of our safe neighborhood! think of the children!""

houston,3dyz0l,drfarren,5,Mon Jul 20 20:23:59 2015 UTC,"You're right.  The race component only factors in where the lines of classism, accent racial boundaries. The thing is that classicism and racism are pretty closely related in most of the US due to how areas are carved out to ""put"" minorities and separate them from richer white neighborhoods.   Classism and Systematic Racism are kind of the same thing -- Outright racism is a lot more direct. So i think both terms are kind of correct but it is much less volatile/argumentative to just call it classism to avoid misdirecting the discussion. (Hence why I agree with you.)  I, personally, am all for extending the rail system. The best thing about living in LA for me was how robust and expansive their rail/subway system is. Houston would become a much healthier city if we endorsed mass expansion of rails to and encouraged stops close enough to make walking/biking/short-distance park-and-rides a thing across the city. My long-term dream would be lines that touch Sugarland, Greenspoint, West Houston, the closest parts of Katy, the upper edge of Webster, and all converge in the center of Downtown."

houston,3dyz0l,cestith,9,Tue Jul 21 17:22:20 2015 UTC,A strong economy needs a transportation network to support it.  Real conservatives understand that the government must provide the basic amenities for moving a workforce efficiently.  You can't make money if your workforce is stuck in traffic so the costs of having more rail would be justified by a more efficient workforce.  tl;dr - Rail is an investment that will give you good returns.

houston,3dytg0,TurboSalsa,3,Mon Jul 20 18:09:44 2015 UTC,"I was going to post this, but he did say credible. I tried searching the medical examiners DB, but it only let me go back to 2014."
houston,3dytg0,simmonsg,5,Mon Jul 20 18:02:30 2015 UTC,"Meh, close enough. Unless this guy has information the medical examiner doesn't it's safe to say that a codeine overdose was a major contributing factor. When a 29 year old drinks large quantities of a known respiratory depressant and suddenly stops breathing I think we can draw a few logical conclusions."
houston,3dytg0,TurboSalsa,4,Mon Jul 20 18:06:07 2015 UTC,"I don't know how to word this so it makes sense to someone who isn't from the city, since the majority of my information is ""from the streets""  In the Houston rap scene and especially the south side of Houston in general, it common knowledge about what really happened to Screw.   The medical examiner contributed his death to drank, but the dude wasn't stupid. Drank isn't something you can overdose easily on, because it takes A LOT to kill you. Even if you go through a whole pint, but you'll just end up sleeping for a few days. There's a reason why it's called sippin syrup.   Medical examiner or not, I doubt he has more information than the people who were around him when it happened. Someone put pcp in his drank, which is what actually killed him.  If you get the chance to ask anyone from the original SUC they will tell you that he was murdered."

houston,3e1b3s,trueoak,4,Tue Jul 21 04:50:26 2015 UTC,"3:30 is too late from there; you really should leave by 3 at the latest. Also, 59 flies compared to 45 heading north, so take 59north exit from 45. I have to fly every week around that time on Monday, except I leave from Montrose and taking 59 usually takes 30-40 min. Keep in mind that if you're checking bags, they won't even let you check them within a hour of the flight departure time unless it gets delayed."
houston,3e1b3s,txchris,3,Tue Jul 21 08:46:51 2015 UTC,"45 can be a real pain in the ass any time of the day, especially near UH.  I would take the Sam Houston Parkway around the entire city and loop over to IAH that way.  Doesn't sound like you'd be considering 59 but if you were, the HOV lane to IAH is usually quick."
houston,3e1b3s,texaself,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:57:05 2015 UTC,"The HOV is definitely an option, but if I recall correctly, it kicks us off a bit before downtown.  What time would you think works best with the flight time?"

From my house in Midtown, it takes a consistent 30-35 minutes.  Since League City –> Midtown area is probably, what, 30 minutes at least?  Budget 1.5 hours to get from League City –> IAH.  Need 1 hr (IMO) max at the airport, 1.5 to be safe.  So leave your house 3 hrs before your flight.  Wow that's 2:40pm.  But unless you think my assumptions above are off, that's your go-time."

houston,3e1b3s,_fivebyfive_,3,Tue Jul 21 09:07:41 2015 UTC,You're not going to make it if you leave at 3:30.  That much is painfully obvious.
houston,3e1b3s,msjd1983,2,Tue Jul 21 14:31:37 2015 UTC,I live in your area and I would leave at 2pm.  2:30 at the absolute latest.  A lot of people don't take into consideration the amount of time it takes to park and shuttle to the airport.  Not to mention that there is more than likely going be some traffic issue or other on your way up there.
houston,3e1b3s,Snatch_Pastry,3,Tue Jul 21 17:15:44 2015 UTC,"I would say to leave your home around 12:30. I know that sounds ridiculously early, but I'm the kind of guy that doesn't like to take chances when it comes to making a flight on time.  If you want to live life dangerously 1:30-2."
houston,3e1b3s,aussie_jason,2,Tue Jul 21 04:54:32 2015 UTC,"Is it truly that awful in the middle of a work day that even leaving at 2 is a risky gamble?  I'm not trying to undermine what you said, I'm just trying to understand!"
houston,3e1b3s,texaself,5,Tue Jul 21 04:59:00 2015 UTC,"You would be insane to leave at 3:30. And you would probably miss your flight. It's an international flight, that adds complications (not many, but a few). Bush international is pretty dead in the early afternoon, so if you got to the airport at 3, you certainly won't have any problems. So you should leave at 2 and probably use the beltway, if you have a fast-pass. Traffic won't be very bad.   If your ride can't do that, there are shuttles which pick up people for pretty cheap. But if you're using one of those, be aware that they make a lot of other stops, so if you have to shuttle add on two more hours."
houston,3e1b3s,msjd1983,3,Tue Jul 21 07:26:54 2015 UTC,Leaving at 2:00 wouldn't be too much of a gamble but keep in mind that peak hour starts as early as 3:00 in this cursed city.

Mix in some libertarians who are curious but not really sold on his policies. On Reddit, there's pretty much a massive Sanders echo-chamber, pumped up by any news article that states anything positive about the Senator.

A big reason is that he is not Jeb or Hillary. They know that he won't get anything done if he's president. He doesn't want foreign wars and his social policy isn't as bad as Hillary or Jeb. He also doesn't play the politics game which gets a lot of respect from libertarians. Another big reason is that he seems like a genuinely good person.
houston,3dwv2t,_nate_higgers,17,Mon Jul 20 15:33:13 2015 UTC,"Attempting to find a candidate who agrees with everything you do and is also trustworthy, rigorous, etc is pretty tough.  I'll take integrity and fairness over just about any other quality in politics, even though I don't agree with lots of his ideas those two things give me more faith than any amount of ""promises"" from other candidates.   Also the fact that he's a loud mouth is great, I would love to see someone come into office and be honest about the levels of corruption there.

The wealth gap in this country is at its worst in a very long time and widening every day. Big banks have ruined a lot of people and yet nobody went to jail and the regulations to prevent it from happening again are being slowly repealed. We spend more per capita on healthcare and see the worst results of the developed world. Millions of people are ""working poor,"" and are therefore a burden on the welfare system anyway because real wages keep falling. Bernie is the only person aggressively addressing these issues. He won't win, but it's important that he be given a voice in the process so that Democrats will eventually implement the change he wants to make."

houston,3dwv2t,illegal_deagle,-1,Mon Jul 20 15:35:48 2015 UTC,Glad you mentioned Healthcare. I think the biggest problem with our current system is the outrageous cost set between hospitals and insurers. Without addressing the root cause of healthcare costs being so outrageously high you're just distributing that high cost over everyone. If healthcare was actually a free market you would see competition to lower prices.
houston,3dwv2t,zimm3rmann,11,Mon Jul 20 15:54:24 2015 UTC,"Healthcare is not, has never been, and can never be based on a free market. You know why? Because a free market is based on rational economic choices and clear risk vs reward paradigms.   You will never see that in healthcare because it's literally life or death - and you'll definitely never see it in US healthcare because of our particular constant need to delay the inevitable.   This hodgepodge of Medicaid/Medicare/insurance/employers/government/etc is an absolute fucking mess because there are too many cooks in the kitchen. You don't even have to take my word for it, just look at literally every other developed country in the world to see socialized medicine save both money and lives."

The wealthy are practically dancing on the backs of the poor. And they are still laboring to devise new ways to squeeze what little prosperity they can out of us. And mark my words, they will go after social security, it's only a matter of time.  We believe it's immoral to shackle people with crippling debt in order to receive an education.  We believe a person should expect a livable income for whatever job they get. Not have to supplement it with two jobs or welfare.  We believe a person should have access to healthcare anytime, anywhere.  We believe any financial institution too big to fail & too big to jail needs to be broken up.  We believe in an America that takes care of all of us, not just the wealthy and powerful.  And we are the freeloaders? We are the ones who want everything handed to us?

I will quickly point out that it was Clinton that signed the bill deregulating the banks. The economy is NOT doing well AND there are no regulations keeping things fair. The financial elite know how to make money without any healthy contribution to the economy overall. Thus widening the divide.   Look at all of the other countries that went down the socialist path. It just does not work out well. What does is proper regulation and proper taxation in a free market.  The ultra wealthy need to be shut down and the way to do this is regulation. All regulation needs to be focused on channeling money and resources into production. NOT profit through arbitrage. I can't explain in a single post but that is essentially what is creating the ultra wealth. Profiteering through arbitrage. ON so many levels and in a large variety of ways. Ill give you one small example CDO's - this has to be the worst financial creation on the planet, second only to fiat currency.

Annual tax almost always is going toward something like debt service (to build the utility infrastructure), repairs & maintenance, standard operating expenses, etc. Also, for what it's worth, active MUDs tend to have regular Board meetings which, by law, are publicly posted."

Quality of web interface usually is the distinguishing factor. Let's see, I've had: Gexa, Infinite, Reliant, TXU, and now Discount Power.  They truly are all the same. Anyone else disagree with that? I really think it's a matter of picking the company offering the lowest rates for your anticipated monthly kWh usage.  I found our new cheap plan with Discount Power via PowerToChoose. It was a plan offered only if you accessed it via PowerToChoose; going straight to Discount Power's site didn't show their lowest rates."

We live in a 1BR ~700sft apartment and our highest bill came in at around $80 last August, the lowest bill we've seen was for $20. The price is great, and there's a lot of incentives to spread the word about bounce. I'd say we've received well over $200 in referrals alone. It's easy, if you use this code: 1589787 when signing up you'll receive a $50 bill credit after 3 on time payments. We've had them for a year and a half, after 6 months of on time payments we got free movie tix, after 9 months we got a $20 walmart gift card, and after the first year we got another $50 bill credit. We're on track to recieve a 5% discount every month, assuming we can make it to 24 on time payments"

Plus we have dogs so a big lot with a 2 car garage is a huge plus!   There's a great hidden driving range up there too with $2.50 beers if you're into that. And the amenities arent far at all, aussie_jason said it best."

houston,3e1ggk,UnclaimedPants,5,Tue Jul 21 19:37:12 2015 UTC,"It depends on what side of 290, East is fine, West is not."
houston,3e1ggk,aussie_jason,2,Tue Jul 21 12:00:19 2015 UTC,"It's OK. It's close to TC Jester Park which is a great amenity. Disc golf, pool, running and bike lanes. East of Mangum tends to be a little nicer in terms of houses. If you do a house, you'll get as big of a back yard as you might in the burbs. It's all about what you want. You won't get boutique antique shops and trendy bars within walking distance. But it can be a nice neighborhood with an older population that is slowly getting younger"

He kept reiterating that he was a good christian man and just wanted to help. I was like ""fine"" and he did this weird thing with my wheel, turning it and trying to fix something. I really don't know, it was sort of a blur. After he ""fixed"" it, he prayed and then told me he used a part that he had on him that cost 300 dollars. I told him no because he never told me about this part and he can take it back. He said he couldn't take it back and he could go with me to an ATM. I said nope and I have no money. Then I started asking him where exactly he saw me come in from. The woman started to join in the convo and added that they saw me come from a direction I did not come from. I called her out and the man basically told her to shut up and said she was confused. I knew they were lying but the sedan reeked of weed so I could see her being confused. I ended up saying whatever and put 10 dollars of gas in their car so they'd leave me alone. Went to the cashier, gave 10 dollars (after the guy yelled ""can you please make it 20?"").

On my way there I called HPD and told them to go there (they never made it), and when I got there this sketchy dude fitting your description and a woman in the passenger seat were there. Said he was a mechanic at the Goodyear on Bissonnet and 610, so I said ""great! What's your name? I just want to confirm you work there."" He gave some bullshit excuse about how his boss doesn't like him doing this on the side (I just liked watching him squirm), then I told him I've already called the cops and they should be here any minute. He had a shocked look, started giving a pathetic ""but I have priors..."" Excuse then just ran to his car and booked it. We took his license # and filed a report at a nearby HPD outpost.

I'm aware that Houston is a huge city, and poverty is not unknown here (I kinda see poverty as being an indicator of crime, not because poor people are criminals, but because poor people are desperate, and desperate people do stupid things).

houston,3dw0cp,mbrumlow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:12:11 2015 UTC,"MY mom had something smart on the subject ""If someone REALLY wants to take something from you, there is no way to stop them. All you can do is try to make sure you're safe.  Basic, inexpensive things will go a long way to helping you live safer.   Don't go out at night if you can help it Don't stop as stores or gas stations that look dumpy or are poorly lit (you're an easy target there) have your local police dept on speed dial (911 is nice, but that's the long way around). in your home, on all doors install 3 inch screws into your kick plates (they go past the door frame and into the studs. they won't STOP someone from getting in, but they will buy to time to prepare/call police/arm yourself/gather loved ones/run). shatter sensors on windows or door open sensors will let you know when someone is trying to get in through other places. pepper spray is a good, non lethal deterant for many problems, but not the best solution. a tazer gun can disable most people long enough to give you a chance to disarm them (also to tie them up if you've got rope or heavy zip ties near by) if you're being mugged, it's not worth loosing your life over, let them take what they want, just get the best description you can to the police and let them do their job. DO NOT walk outside at night with headphones on. You will never hear them coming up behind you. With open ears, you can at least make your way to a public place like a shop or a friendly house/apartment, but without that advantage they can hit you from behind and do what they want. Real story, the day of my HS graduation party, my great uncle was attacked form behind like that, he was hit in the back of the head with a pipe or a bat and was killed instantly. Why? for his wallet. Needless to say my party took on a somber tone when 15 minutes in we got a call from the police to request my grandfather ID the body. finally, a gun. I hate sounding like this, but in the end you MAY have to take someone's life. Some people just don't think when they rob a place or they think they have nothing left to loose. SOMETIMES it boils down to your life or theirs and you have to make the call. IF you want to take this option, practice using your weapon, take classes on safety and proper handling. One well placed round is more effective than a dozen shots fired blindly.   Meet your neighbors, learn what vehicles they drive, recognize regular visitors, report suspicious activity immediately, know the route you need to take, and keep your eyes open."
houston,3dw0cp,audiobydarksock,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:49:43 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I don't want to scare you, but it's really not uncommon. I know 4 people who have been robbed at gunpoint. Almost everyone I know in Houston has either had their car broken into, their house broken into, or been mugged. If you live in a house, be sure to have an alarm. My old car was broken into about 4 times, had the stereo system stolen once (I never left stuff laying out in view). My new car has an alarm and has never been broken into (I've had it for about 5 years) so I think that makes a difference.  All of the people I know who were robbed at gunpoint were young men and two of them were on bikes. One of those robberies happened in West U, an upper middle class white neighborhood so it can happen anywhere. Another friend was attacked in a very busy spot in a nice neighborhood. They started beating the shit out of him but a guy in the house they were in front of walked out with a shotgun and scared them off (they didn't have guns).   It has nothing to do with stupidity and often little to do with being aware of your surroundings. The best advice I have is to not walk around alone. I'm honestly considering moving out of Houston because I'm so sick of the crime. I travel to Europe a lot and it's amazing being in a place where you don't have to constantly worry about guns. Again, sorry to be such a downer, but you gotta be careful!"
houston,3dw0cp,texasguy911,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:16:48 2015 UTC,"Houston is not a terribly safe city. But I guess that's just par for the course for most big cities. In general, the odds of you being involved in armed robbery are fairly low. Relatively speaking, they're pretty high. Situational awareness is the most important thing. When you get out of your car anywhere, be aware of your surroundings. Don't park and sit there staring at your phone or texting while walking into the store. Assess potential threats. If you see them,  You can rest assured that someone who walks up to you in a parking lot or talks to you in the street isn't trying to be your friend. They want something from you. In general, just keep your head on a swivel.  I can recommend some home safety measures, if you're interested. Also, you live in gun country. I would recommend getting one, if for no other reason than to familiarize yourself with it and then throw it under the bed and forget it until you need it. If you'd like to give it a try, I would be happy to accompany you to the shooting range. You would just pay for range fees and ammo.  Or if you just wanna have a beer and a chat, I'm open to that as well. I love talking to foreigners."

I have a vague interest, and a healthy respect for firearms, but my general opinion is that I shouldn't turn the possibility of an armed robbery into a certainty by supplying the gun. I'm less likely to be shot if I don't have one than if I do (if that makes sense).  Other than that, I am relatively cautious simply because I don't know the area very well yet.  Thanks for the offer, though. I've been out shooting with my boss a couple of times, and I used to go range shooting with bolt-action rifles in Australia (no semi-auto rifles for the regular consumer there).  I feel pretty safe where I am, but I guess I'm not always at home or work, so it pays to keep an eye out."

houston,3dw0cp,gambasong,5,Mon Jul 20 04:51:52 2015 UTC,"Different cultures are probably the major factor here. We had gun control implemented nearly 20 years ago by our very conservative government, and it's worked out well. (From an average of one mass killing with guns/year over a 20 year period, to one (a murder/suicide from a deeply mentally unstable guy) in the following 20 years.)  That being said, I'm no stranger to lunatics wielding guns (when I was a child, a neighbor would regularly shoot at our house from the hill in an attempt to scare us off from the area. He was growing large amounts of pot, and saw the neighbors as a threat, despite the fact that we used to be friends with him/his family).  Anyway, I feel that any situation could only be escalated by having more guns. I'd rather be robbed than shot, and I'd rather avoid the situation entirely if possible."

houston,3dw0cp,quietiscomfort,2,Mon Jul 20 05:48:58 2015 UTC,"Same thing happened to me. I actually pulled into a Gas station and got gas then went into the store to buy some lotto tickets.   When I came out a fair skinned hispanic man waved me down and told me that he was honking at me and that he pulled into the gas station to warn me that my front right tire was wobbling.   I took issue with this story because I had already been at the gas station for like 15 minutes.  I was running on empty and it took forever to fill my gas tank. At least 3 other cars had come and gone while I was putting gas in my car. I then had been in the store long enough to wait in line and then scratch off at least 20 scratchers. I am very slow with my scratchers.  Anyway, he keep insisting that he would help. I kept quizzing him on where he had seen me and he claimed I came from a road I had not come from. He had some story that he worked for goodyear and would be able to help with my wobbly tire. But he kept making mistakes. He said I had a smart car, but I have a prius, he said it was a 2012, but it's a 2014. For somebody who could fix my car he seemed to not know very much about my car. Anyways, I told him thanks and kicked my tire and it felt fine. He then wanted me to get into my car and turn the tire to the left so he could check it out. I told him no, that it was fine, I have it under warrantee and that if there was a problem the dealership would fix it without question. He started getting upset and told me that I was going to endanger people's lives by driving on it. He kept getting very close to me and I had to keep taking steps back.   The while thing was unsettling, at first I was fearful, then I was mad. I attempted to go back to the gas station to take his photo but he was no longer there.   If you look it up this is a scam one of the news stations has reported on. Because it was reported I can only assume that more people will try to do this.   The entire thing is that they ""fix"" your car and then demand cash. And if you refuse to pay they raise the price. Apparently other people will come out and pressure you into paying. Some have reported having items stolen from the car.   Anywho, be careful out there. My cynical view is is if somebody is going way out of their way to help you they are likely trying to scam you."

houston,3dz7it,lgt_mnt,3,Mon Jul 20 19:12:03 2015 UTC,breathing intensifies  so.... how about them knicks go carts ...
houston,3dz7it,jj_autobody,4,Mon Jul 20 19:24:12 2015 UTC,"ha... you would be like the 3rd forester this week. Ive havent had a forester before this. Neat cars ...  Anyways .... like to help out redditors. Check out our yelp and some of the work we've done.   Not exactly sure what the other shops told you to do but I think they are (correctly) suggesting to just tell the insurance company that it is already at a shop of your choosing because they will pressure you into taking it to one of their direct repair facilities. Normally these facilities are ok if you dont have a relationship with a shop already.   Anyways if you have any questions shoot me a pm, an email at jj_autobody@yahoo.com or jjautobodyhouston@gmail.com.   Better yet send some pictures via email. If you are filing via insurance the quotes you receive will pretty much be invalid since at the end of the day  insurance and shop negotiate a fair price. If you call being bent over by insurace companies fair .... but we go the extra mile for yall :)  Thank you /u/porknqueso for the summon and for being the late night pork n queso binge sessions after a night out drinkin -_-  Edit: Forgot to mention our paint and workmanship come with a lifetime guarantee so it should never, fade, discolor, chip, or flake for as long as you own your vehicle. if it does bring it back and we fix it for free. if you want to read up on the warranty check out our paint suppliers page on the warranty."
houston,3dz7it,jj_autobody,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:18:02 2015 UTC,"Hi, thanks!  Just texted & emailed you Dropbox link to damage photos.  Thanks for offering to take a look.  Here are three photos I'll share here on Reddit: 2014 Subaru Forester damage photos – Dropbox  Had quotes prepared from two body shops; both said since the hood is bent shut and won't open, they can't know what damage might lie beneath, but that any damage under the hood potentially doubles repair costs.  Lingering question: what distinguishes any body shop from another?  What do you do differently (i.e., better) that presumably less trustworthy shops don't?  Based on your post here, I definitely feel now like I got had, since those 2 body shops did tell me to tell my insurance company the car is ""already at Body Shop X"" and that it'd be advantageous for me since they could essentially ""talk shop"" and get the adjuster to offer more than s/he otherwise would.  Hmm...  (Grr, I despise being at an information deficit!)  Sadly the Forester is actually my husband's.  I've been razzing him for years about his overly-cautious driving habits.  Of course I'm the one to wreck his car.  Anyway, thanks again.  Look forward to possibly doing business with you."

It was melted in this same way and smoking in the morning after a party.  I put water on it and all of the soil kinda fell and caved in like it was all ash.  I was so confused and it took me a while to figure out that good soil is kinda flammable and a cigarette from the night before made the soil catch fire and smolder all night.

houston,3dwpoz,Oag777,2,Mon Jul 20 06:02:16 2015 UTC,"Is Fieldstone a neighborhood? I live in the northern part of Rosenberg and go that way for groceries. You can expect to pay a lot of tolls if you live in the 99 /westpark vicinity. The prices are higher there for homes, and with it being brand new development iwth a lot of open land still left on 99, who knows what it will grow into.   For me it's a nice place to visit for shopping, but i prefer the Rosenberg/Fulshear area further west. My exact home we built in our neighborhood was being built in Long Meadow Farms for a lot more - our pest control guy walked in and said, 'this is my house', and was kinda bummed when he realized the difference."
houston,3dwpoz,HoustonBrooke,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:31:28 2015 UTC,Yeah field stone is right off south Mason near 99. We are looking at building a house there as they start phase 3 of the building.   For me it's not so bad because I go to the airport a lot for work...usually before there is any traffic to worry about.  I've been driving over in the area for the last two weeks from where I currently live (hwy 6 and west airport). And I cab ride the feeder road of 99 without any issues to avoid the tolls which are good....I haven't really gone very far up yet....I think the furthest I've ventured was up to westpark toll road.  Seems like they are planning a lot of retail builds in the area and while it's kind of empty now....I'm seeing a lot of commercial land starting to sell which implies stores eventually!  Just that %3.4 property tax is insane lol
houston,3dwpoz,HoustonBrooke,2,Mon Jul 20 14:45:50 2015 UTC,"Ugh, yeah. For me, ignorance is bliss. It's my first home, so I just accept the property tax for what it is - and if I ever move out of Fort Bend it'll be like I'm getting a discount!

If you work in Katy or far SW Houston/Sugarland/etc, and your job is stable, it's a great place that's booming right now.  Houses are going up like mad.  It's just rather isolated at the moment, and will be for a very long time.  I have several friends who just bought out there, and although the houses are beautiful, I don't see how they can justify the price point with the recent housing downturn."
