SkyPorn,3dzat4,FlatsixBus,2,Tue Jul 21 04:07:15 2015 UTC,"As someone that lives a block from this pier, I have to say the ""always foggy"" things seems over played. Usually it's overcast and not fog right at sea level in Sharp Park (the neighborhood this pic was taken). There are spots in Pacifica that get a ton of fog though, in the higher elevations."
SkyPorn,3dzjq9,escgallery,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:20:31 2015 UTC,"I normally don’t have my telephoto lens with me while out shooting landscapes, but since I didn’t really have a second chance to go back, I brought it along, and glad I did! While shooting the sunset, I saw a lone sailboat off in the distance returning to shore. I waited about 30 minutes for the perfect alignment of the sailboat passing just underneath the sun. I couldn’t have asked for a better setup! The warm golden glow was intense, masking out the sailboat and he horizon. Hawaii really does have some of the most beautiful sunsets in the world!

SkyPorn,3c36t0,screamer_,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:23:40 2015 UTC,"Very nice picture, but which part is explained by the Tyndall effect?"
SkyPorn,3c36t0,exscape,3,Sat Jul 4 11:26:58 2015 UTC,"The ""beams"", that made it past the cloud. You can only see them, because the light is scattered by particles and probably also tiny water droplets."
SkyPorn,3c36t0,exscape,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:23:16 2015 UTC,"Well, we can only see the blue sky due to Rayleigh scattering, so there's always visible scattering in the sky. :)    Are crepuscular rays only visible when there are larger particles present? I thought they basically formed when clouds cast shadows, making the non-shadowed parts stand out as rays. That is, they're just plain blue sky from Rayleigh scattering."
SkyPorn,3c36t0,Nitrax92,2,Sat Jul 4 20:10:03 2015 UTC,"You got it all right. Crepuscular rays (Thanks for that term, TIL) are visible due to shadows. If there weren't any, all of the sky would appear hazy. And yes, Rayleigh is about scattering at objects of a size smaller than the wavelength and the Tyndall effect is about colloidal scattering with objects larger than that wavelength.  That's basically why those ""beams"" appear to hover above the blue sky. Had the sun stood even lower, Id' expected them to be yellow or even red instead of whitish."

When you take a photo, based on the calibration of settings (white balance, ISO, shutter speed, aperture, etc) you can yield various different results of the same scene. Not to mention the jpg creation algorithm is differnet from one camera manufacturer to to the next.  There's no such thing as ""unedited.""  /rant."

SkyPorn,3bmfag,mashuto,5,Tue Jun 30 21:31:29 2015 UTC,"Because a lot of people misunderstand ""little artistic control"" with ""the more the better"", which leaves us with awful ""HDRs""."
SkyPorn,3bmfag,EARTH_IS_BEAUTIFUL,4,Tue Jun 30 21:39:10 2015 UTC,"But the opposite is also true, those that think any editing instantly means horrible HDR. Hence... posts like this, as if the fact that its ""unedited"" somehow instantly makes it better than anything thats been edited at all."
SkyPorn,3bmfag,mashuto,3,Tue Jun 30 22:05:12 2015 UTC,"I agree to your opinion that editing doesn't automatically mean horrible results.  But - unedited just means ""hey look, no artifically enhanced things are used to create this picture, it kind of looks just like it looked in real life"""

I tried back in March from a spot in Eastern WA but couldn't see anything with the naked eye.  Having gone camping on the Olympic Peninsula a couple weeks ago, I thought that a spot in the San Juans would be perfect if there were solar activity again, and from Seattle it was easy to choose Whidbey Island because I could get there quickly by ferry, but still return late at night via the bridge at Deception Pass on the north side of the island (after the ferries stop running).  Got out there in time to capture the sunset as well. Set up my camera and shot various star trails until about 1am.  We almost gave up and went home, but at 1:15am the aurora grew in intensity, not just in the camera but also clearly visible to the naked eye.  They stayed visible until about 2:30am when we decided to head home and get ready for work... kinda brutal next day at work, but totally worth capturing these shots.  The entire Flickr set is here."

This website  will tell you the probably of seeing it directly overhead based on your GPS.   Keep in mind,  that's overhead,  you may still be able to see it on the horizon even if the number is very low.   Kp index is a measure of the likelihood of an aurora borealis.  Apps like NorthernEye and AuroraNotifier factor will alert you when the Kp Index is high on a a scale of 1-9.   You generally want +5 for storm activity and last night it was at an 8.   This website  helps in figuring out this Kp thing."

I live on top of a high place in Stockholm so I have a good view of the sky, and can see that the sun only dips about 10 degrees below the horizon at it's deepest point during the night of the summer solstice. Even the shortest night (something like 18.5-19h sunlight that goes over into about 5h of twilight that passes directly into dawn) is darker than this. It's still very, very light, yes. I'd say that it's light enough to read a book outside at the darkest twilight night of the year and during about 2 months surrounding the solstice too for that matter.

SkyPorn,398z97,SuburbanHierarchy,8,Wed Jun 10 03:00:01 2015 UTC,How do they get pictures like this that not only show an entire storm but an unobstructed view of everything under it?
SkyPorn,398z97,FeculentUtopia,8,Wed Jun 10 06:40:25 2015 UTC,"A high quality wide angle lens, a full frame camera, sometimes paired with multiple shots stitched together, and no small amount of skill as a chaser and photographer.  Kelly DeLay is what we in the chasing community call a ""structure junky"". He's known for his photos of overall storm structure, rather than in-your-face video taken dangerously close to the tornado. He tends to maintain a fair amount of standoff distance, which gives him an opportunity to catch these expansive photos.  As for visibility underneath and such, that's partially where you chase (Flat and treeless is good), and the type of storm you're on. This was in Colorado, so that gives you flat and treeless, and it's a Low Precipitation Supercell, which keeps rain and hail from obscuring what's going on underneath."
SkyPorn,398z97,hamsterdave,3,Wed Jun 10 12:46:05 2015 UTC,"From a meteorological stand point its because of the moisture available in the atmosphere. Given that this picture was taken in the Colorado the atmosphere is less saturated than say in the southeastern US. Since the air is drier it more graciously accepts any available moisture, which causes droplets to evaporate readily. So in this region of the country supercells that form typically have less obstruction from rain shafts etc. that you might see in a high precipitation supercell elsewhere. Further, the picture was taken on the plains so surface features that could also obstruct (trees, topography) aren't an issue."
SkyPorn,398z97,dcunni20,-3,Wed Jun 10 13:38:10 2015 UTC,Luck (and some skill knowing where to go)
SkyPorn,398z97,nerddtvg,7,Wed Jun 10 11:40:29 2015 UTC,"You've got that completely backwards.  You can chase your entire life and never even have an opportunity to catch a photo like that, much less actually come away with it when you're in the right place at the right time. Kelly DeLay is a very skilled chaser and photographer.  That photo is about 70% skill as a chaser. Knowing what storm to go for, and what storm to ignore, how to move around it safely, how to maintain good visibility, and how to anticipate what it will do. The remainder is skill as a photographer (because you could put most people in the same location, with the same camera, and not get nearly as good an image) and persistence as a chaser, because the more storms you're on, the more likely you are to have a great opportunity like this.  Chasers who rely on luck spend a lot of time chasing rain and taking mediocre photos."
SkyPorn,398z97,hamsterdave,2,Wed Jun 10 12:42:22 2015 UTC,"Whoah now. I wasn't out to offend anyone. It takes a lot of skill to get in the right position for any type of weather photo, tornadoes especially. I have a massive amount of respect for anyone who can. But it takes a lot of luck to get two perfect tornadoes in a clear field and clean shot."
SkyPorn,398z97,nerddtvg,4,Wed Jun 10 13:08:23 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, no offense taken. /u/FeculentUtopia's question was a bit more general than that, so it sounded like you were missing how much skill went in to it.  Regarding the twin tornadoes, yeah, that's pure, unadulterated luck. Those occur perhaps a handful of times each year, they're very difficult to spot on radar, and you'd be mad to chase storms specifically looking for that. The counter-rotating tornadoes are much more rare than that, even.   The unobstructed view goes back to knowing how to move around the storm to maintain visibility without getting killed, and being able to look at the radar and know which storms are likely to give you a good view in the first place."

The counter-rotating tornadoes are much more rare than that, even.   Exactly what I was trying to convey, but perhaps should have explained it more. You may be the most skilled person in terms of weather and photography, but a few degrees of temperature variance and the entire thing either blows up into something epic or fizzles out into nothingness.   The unobstructed view goes back to knowing how to move around the storm to maintain visibility without getting killed, and being able to look at the radar and know which storms are likely to give you a good view in the first place.   And don't forget the weekend warriors (which I will admit, is a dream of mine) that will clog up the roads making it hard to navigate and get unobstructed pictures."

SkyPorn,377byk,davewinkwink,1 point,Mon May 25 21:45:03 2015 UTC,"This was my first opportunity to shoot a storm, so I was still playing around with the settings. Exposure for this shot was a little over eight minutes on my wide angle 11-16mm. Aperture was at f/2.8 while ISO was at 100. I had the lens pointed north away from any close city lights as best as possible. Had to crop a bit to get rid of the light pollution, which is inevitable for such a long exposure."

SkyPorn,35ymjn,bscooter26,1 point,Thu May 14 18:12:25 2015 UTC,How often does this happen up there? Seeing the Northern Lights has always been on my bucket list
SkyPorn,35ymjn,shorthurrdontcurr,2,Thu May 14 21:41:42 2015 UTC,"Ummm. Hard to say. The northern lights are (I'm not the best at scienceing this stuff) essentially charged particles emitted from the sun through flares. The particles react with gases in our atmosphere. So it's very reliant on the Suns activity. Out side of winnipeg you can see them around once every two weeks in the winter. Not as much in the summer. If you are up in Churchill, you can see them brighter, stronger and more vivid and frequently"

You know you're spoiled with sunrises and sunsets when your first thought is...meh...could have been better! :) But it was a pretty magical experience. I got to see several fish splashing nearby, geese and ducks a dozen or so feet away flying just a couple of feet over the water, and a beaver swimming. It was a great end to a fantastic day.

SkyPorn,349p0r,SdifOdh,7,Wed Apr 29 15:01:55 2015 UTC,They are probably illuminated by very low angle light during sunset or sunrise.
SkyPorn,349p0r,hamsterdave,3,Wed Apr 29 18:44:15 2015 UTC,"As /u/JRoch said, they are mammatus clouds.  They are often found preceding thunderstorms and tornadoes."
SkyPorn,349p0r,ForestfortheDraois,5,Wed Apr 29 15:11:43 2015 UTC,"They actually are most common on the rear of the storm. More often than not, you'll see them after you've had your ass handed to you.  Source: Storm chaser for 20 years."
SkyPorn,349p0r,hamsterdave,2,Wed Apr 29 18:45:34 2015 UTC,"I was just going with what wiki said.   True to their ominous appearance, mammatus clouds are often harbingers of a coming storm or other extreme weather system"
SkyPorn,349p0r,ForestfortheDraois,6,Wed Apr 29 21:25:51 2015 UTC,"That's technically correct, but it's a bit misleading IMO. Usually if you see them on the front of the storm, it's in the dissipating stage and is weakening quickly.  First off, the clouds are caused by large amounts of cold air sinking.  Thunderstorms are huge convective cells. In that image, the storm is moving from left to right.  A storm can only continue to either build, or exist in a relatively steady state, if the air it is taking in, primarily from in front of it (and, in the northern Hemisphere, to the south of it if it's moving west to east), is either about the same amount of energy, or is increasing in potential energy. Energy in a convective cell like that comes jointly from temperature and moisture content. More moisture or hotter = more buoyancy = faster updraft.  If you see mammatus clouds on the front of the anvil, it usually means that cold, dry air is mixing down in front of the storm. With few exceptions, this will undercut the storm as it runs over its own downdraft, robbing it of the warm, moist air it needs to maintain itself. This is very nearly the textbook definition of the 'dissipation stage' of a thunderstorm, when the storm becomes 'downdraft dominant'.  This can portend extreme weather. Dissipating thunderstorms are the most likely to generate sudden microbursts, and as the updraft weakens, the storm can rather suddenly dump all of its hail in a very small area. In general though, if you see those clouds up front, the storm is doomed, and the collapse is likely to be rapid.  They're much more common on the back of the storm, where a downdraft regime is dominant nearly always. In fact, the sudden appearance of a high velocity, cold downdraft at the rear of the storm, called Rear Flank Downdraft, is a frequent precursor to, not dissipation, but tornadic development. You'll hear chasers shout ""RFD!"" in tornado videos sometimes right before it forms, as they notice a sudden cold wind at their backs, racing inward toward the forming tornado. Mammatus clouds, to my knowledge, are not directly tied to tornadic RFD, but they are indicative of the cool, dry, sinking air that tends to exist at the rear of a thunderstorm.  Every thunderstorm is a tiny advancing cold front and low pressure system, because it is both cooling the air with its own precipitation, and it is mixing down cooler air from aloft with the downward moving precipitation, all while vacuuming up unfathomable quantities of air and flinging it in to the upper atmosphere."
SkyPorn,349p0r,hamsterdave,2,Wed Apr 29 21:54:31 2015 UTC,"While I totally believe what you are saying is true, I've witnessed a thunderstorm last year that didn't fit into this scheme. The mammatus clouds were already ahead of the storm when the storm hit my town, but it had its peak around 3 or 4 hours later.   May that have something to do with the storm being a system of many cells? This is a picture of the radar from that day, if that helps. I'm very interested in this stuff, but my knowledge of this topic is still very basic."
SkyPorn,349p0r,SdifOdh,3,Wed Apr 29 22:11:11 2015 UTC,"Lines of storms like that are most often ""linear"", meaning the wind fields tend to be more or less unidirectional from the surface up to the top of the storm (though speed generally increases with height). Sometimes though, you'll get 'embedded supercells' which are rotating.  In a line of linear storms, it isn't uncommon for one cell to weaken or even die entirely while another (or more than one)nearby explodes. Often this is caused by a back and forth trading of inflow and outflow.  Say you've got one storm, a supercell, cruising along in a steady state. It's all by itself, so there's no competition for energy. The airmass around that storm would look a bit like this.  Another storm suddenly fires just to its south, which is where the inflow jet (a big part of its incoming energy) is located. That new storm suddenly steals the original storm's inflow, and the original storm usually weakens, and often will 'go linear', or take on the characteristics of a non-supercellular storm.  This can repeat itself several times as a squall line evolves, often in the form of 'line segments'. A handful of discrete supercells will fire along the advancing cold front, but spread out enough that they don't interfere with each other. Gradually, through this progression of new cells firing to the south and the northern ones weakening, the line fills in, forming a continuous, mostly linear, squall line.  In the US, there's chaser slang for that last cell on the southern end of a squall line, which can be a supercell even when conditions aren't especially favorable for them: ""Tail End Charlie"". Faced with a squall line, storm chasers will often head for Tail End Charlie.  What you likely witnessed was a single cell within the line weakening or even collapsing completely, while the line as a whole continued on.  Supercells can do this as well sometimes, without morphing in to a line. A new dominant updraft will pop up on the flanking line that likes to form on the inflow jet, and choke the older cell just to its north. If conditions are right, the original updraft will fall apart so quickly that the two storms almost appear to merge, rather than one succeeding the other. In fact, the transition happens so quickly that the normal rush of downdrafts from the dying storm never occur, or are only very brief. Such storms are said to be 'cyclic'.  On rare occasions, supercells will cycle while both are actively producing a tornado, resulting in two tornadoes being on the ground at once. Usually one is just to the south of the other, so the same point doesn't get hit twice. This happened in Greensburg, KS in 2008 when the town was hit by an EF-5 tornado that cycled just after it struck the town."

SkyPorn,349p0r,padfootmeister,3,Wed Apr 29 23:22:55 2015 UTC,"A hook echo indicates a supercell, but may not necessarily mean there is a serious risk for a tornado.   If you're interested, and willing to buy a ~$10 app for your smart phone, I can teach you how to read the Storm Relative Motion and velocity radar products, which is what the National Weather Service uses for issuing a tornado warning. Radarscope (I think it is) for iOS, and Pykl3 for Android are the two best radar apps out there, in my opinion."

Add that with mammatus formations and the recipe for a rapture-like storms is a brewin'."
SkyPorn,349p0r,cumplaycents,2,Wed Apr 29 15:57:44 2015 UTC,"These clouds occur on the bottom of the anvil cloud of mature thunderstorms. Their color is a result of the light conditions. If they're brown or reddish, it's usually because it's near sunset. If they're green, it's often because the cloud has a large amount of suspended hail.  The presence of the clouds portends lightning, the color is just coincidental."
SkyPorn,349p0r,hamsterdave,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:47:06 2015 UTC,does a large amount of suspended hail increase the chance of lightning in that direct area?
SkyPorn,349p0r,cumplaycents,3,Wed Apr 29 20:30:53 2015 UTC,"At best, the answer is 'maybe'. There is some evidence that ice plays a significant role in lightning generation, but exactly how, and what sort of ice plays a role, is still a topic of debate.  Hail can tell you a lot about how powerful the storm is though, which will tell you a lot about its lightning potential. The presence of large hailstones, or especially a huge volume of medium sized hail, is a good indication of a storm that has all of the necessary components to generate intense lightning. Large hailstones require extremely high vertical wind speeds in order to grow so large without falling to the ground.   These very high vertical speeds tend to be indicative of a storm that is in a very energy rich environment, it's rooted at the surface (meaning it is pulling a large amount of it's heat energy from very close to the ground), it has plenty of moisture ot work with, and it has a very tall updraft (tapping the largest amount of potential energy in the atmosphere. A side note: It is relatively uncommon for hail larger than golf balls to be associated with ""linear"" thunderstorms, or storms that exist in a wind field that is all traveling in the same direction from the surface to the top of the storm. The storms that produce that sort of hail tend to be supercells, which rotate almost like tiny hurricanes.  Another side note: Supercells are responsible for nearly all tornadoes, and the hail tends to fall just in front of the tornado. This is the source of the folk wisdom that, if the sky is green or you see hail, head for the cellar.  Interestingly, storms that produce very large hail rarely produce lots of hail by volume, as they usually exist in a somewhat moisture-deprived environment. All of the precipitation held aloft by the updraft (referred to as precipitation loading) acts to slow down the updraft somewhat. Just like a human can either hold a large number of small objects above their heads, or a small number of large objects, storms are limited in the total weight of precipitation they can hold aloft. Storms with tons of moisture to work with spend a lot of their energy holding all that water and small hail up, reducing the updraft speed and causing the hail to fall before it grows really large.  In my experience, the most violent electrical storms tend to produce an enormous volume of medium sized hail, with storms that produce very large stones coming in second. This is likely because of the very high moisture environment (which makes air lighter and more willing to rise quickly) that such storms exist in.   Storms that produce small hail (smaller than a dime) tend to either have a more limited height, or less energy, resulting in less lightning as well."

SkyPorn,33tuqp,ZucriyAmsuna,3,Sat Apr 25 18:18:00 2015 UTC,Is that a funnel cloud I see to the left of the red and white tower?
SkyPorn,33tuqp,yaamen,1 point,Sat Apr 25 19:07:20 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting question.   The picture is at 10mm, so it's closer than it looks, but still a little ways away.  It caught my attention in the field and I couldn't confirm any rotation (I was chasing a little further south hoping somehow the storm could keep a tail-end charlie)... there were LOTS of chasers closer and ultimately they're the ones who should be able to make a judgement on what it is or isn't      This is the best view of it (about 30s before the picture I posted here)  The storm had already lost supercell characteristics and this is the leading edge, so the feature didn't last very long - maybe 3 minutes.  I did throw the 200mm onto it eventually, one I tried to see if it was rotating first - but by then the lift had already become more diffuse and it certainly was scud by then.  I've seen things like this a few times before, and the general thing I come to is ""not particularly interesting on its own"" and certainly not the kind of thing I'd call in.  This is a good example from 3/29/12 in missouri.  Kind of weak funnel/scud whatever."

Your post prompted me to check again if there were going to be any flares visible any time soon near me, because I've never seen one.  As amazing good luck would have it, there was one tonight, an hour after sunset. By further great luck the sky was mostly clear and the moon just past new. A little after 9 the family and I went up to Castlerigg Stone Circle and at 9:47 we watched it flare between the Big and Little Dippers. Thank you!

SkyPorn,333r0p,Gamerhcp,0,Sun Apr 19 06:04:59 2015 UTC,"Dinner was a result of good will and misunderstanding between receptionist and our tour guide, she told the hotel staff that we want breakfast arouns 7 instead of 8am because we were going to Karlovy Vary, a place located about 130ish kilometers from Prague, so we went down and nobody from the staff was awake, and to make things more weird, they don't appear to have any security. Long story short, she spoke with the hotel manager and he wanted to make up for this and offered us dinner, free of charge. Dinner was ok, best part of it was the beer. 1.5€ for 0.5l glass of Staropramen, I personally haven't tried better beer in quite a while. And now I'm going to have breakfast and then we're checking out because it's the last day of vacation."
