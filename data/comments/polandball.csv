They found a Byzantine pretender, who promised the crusaders a ridiculous amount of money, military support and the Orthodox Church submitting to the Papacy, and used that pretext to invade Constantinople. When the pretender did not pay up (he did even manage to assert control over the Byzantine Empire), the crusaders sacked Constantinople.  Both the siege on the Dalmatian coast and the sack of Constantinople had been expressly forbidden by the Pope, but the documents in which he did so were kept secret by the clergy of the crusade because they feared the crusade would fail otherwise. For a brief moment, all the crusaders has een excommunicated without them knowing it, but the Pope soon relented and revoked all excommunications, except the Venetians'."
