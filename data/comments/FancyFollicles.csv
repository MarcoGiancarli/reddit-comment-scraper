FancyFollicles,3dz3po,spookybun,23,Mon Jul 20 18:50:43 2015 UTC,It's cotton candy and blue steel from manic panic

FancyFollicles,3dxzh7,sammer87,5,Mon Jul 20 13:31:42 2015 UTC,Very nice. What kind of extensions did you use?
FancyFollicles,3dxzh7,Caged_Sinner,6,Mon Jul 20 15:37:44 2015 UTC,The brand of hair is Bohyme but the method is a mix of beaded and sewn in.

FancyFollicles,3dxzh7,iheartzombiecats,6,Mon Jul 20 13:53:15 2015 UTC,I really love the result! Is that what you call a champagne blonde? It looks like it has pinky tones and I really love it.

FancyFollicles,3e1ag0,whitehandsinkstains,2,Tue Jul 21 04:43:54 2015 UTC,"Silver is very tempermental and difficult to achieve in my experience, it also tends to fade to blonde pretty quickly. But I really like Igora Royal in 9,5-2.2 with 10vol on white-blonde hair. By far the best one I've tried so far.  Should be much easier to maintain compared to sectioned colors, but it does require a decent amount of upkeep if you want to keep it a neutral tone. If maintenance is the annoying part then blue/lavender-silver is a lot easier to achieve and maintain since it neutralizes yellow tones a little more aggressively than a white/gray-silver. You can also use a blue/purple toning shampoo to maintain the tone without worrying too much about offsetting the whiteness of it."
FancyFollicles,3e1ag0,JacksFrosty,2,Tue Jul 21 11:52:28 2015 UTC,"I use Pravana and it's wonderful. If you want it lighter then you should dilute it quite a bit, but if your looking for a darker grey/silver then only slightly dilute it. I like it darker so I find myself re doing it every 3 weeks or so.  I also use Roux Fanci Full in either #41 or #42. It is a leave in color wash. Basically it's a super concentrated colored liquid that you put in after you wash your hair, and it lasts till you wash next. It helps balance out my color and keeps it all over when.   If you have any questions pm me :) silvery grey has been my fav color I've ever done"
FancyFollicles,3e1dhu,fran789,4,Tue Jul 21 05:15:37 2015 UTC,"i dont see why it wouldnt. just get a toner that matches your undertone. if you are warm, go warm. if you are cool, do an ashy blonde."

FancyFollicles,3dwfdl,danicaliforniaa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:00:23 2015 UTC,"I love the color. It is very vibrant and interesting. I'll admit the pattern on your shaved side is what got me to click. I really like the femininity of it.   My real question... how do you get your eyebrows to grow in so thick? Mine are a little thick but they are actually quite curly so they don't lay flat which can cause some gaps. I am too nervous to try to fill them in, so I'm wondering if there is a way I can make the actual brows fill themselves."
FancyFollicles,3dwfdl,alextried,2,Mon Jul 20 20:25:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks!! :) I really appreciate that.   In regards to the eyebrows I've always had big fatty long mofos...   If they're curly and long my advice is to trim them. Google a YouTube tutorial for how to trim em with scissors. It's hard to explain :) but very easy.   And, as for the last part, no, sadly I don't know how to thicken them without filling em in. I fill mine in very much so. My real eyebrows are not quite as nice. A bit more hiccupy. Don't be nervous, branch out!!:)"
FancyFollicles,3e12n7,FossaTessa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:30:21 2015 UTC,"It may be that that's simply the longest your hair can grow. Each person's hair grows for a certain amount of time before naturally shedding, and if you can't surpass a certain length, it's likely that that's the natural lifespan of your hair."
FancyFollicles,3e12n7,looney4lupin,2,Tue Jul 21 03:48:04 2015 UTC,When I was younger it was really long until I cut it. So could that still be a problem even tho it was really long before?
FancyFollicles,3e12n7,byebyebitchez,2,Tue Jul 21 03:51:00 2015 UTC,"How much damage are you doing to your hair? It could be breaking off at a similar rate that it's growing. How much water do you drink? How much quality sleep do you get? How much stress are you under? Do you have a very nutritious diet? Any deficiencies? Quite a lot of factors influence hair growth and breakage, I'd suggest looking very hard at these aspects in particular of your lifestyle to see if anything could be improved and help you out."
FancyFollicles,3dxwhp,Maebenot,2,Mon Jul 20 13:02:52 2015 UTC,It looks great on you! That's an awesome blue.
FancyFollicles,3dz65a,selkie-,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:43:16 2015 UTC,You should be fine. Just really make sure to get the coconut oil out of your hair to lessen the chance if it processing unevenly :)
FancyFollicles,3dzhqe,kimbo412251,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:06:49 2015 UTC,"I'd be very wary of using a blonde shampoo on your hair if it is dark brown (especially if your hair is naturally brunette.)  Blonde shampoos or lightening sprays (like John Frieda's Go Blonder in either form) are made for people with already blonde hair to make their hair even more light. Naturally blonde hair is generally more fine than darker hair, so those products are formulated for that hair type. Because of this, these products can be highly damaging on darker hair (they're still not GREAT on blonde hair, but it's far less damaging.)  Otherwise, I don't have any recommendations since I don't have dark hair. But I wouldn't recommend using a lightening spray or shampoo unless you want crispy hair."

FancyFollicles,3e03qc,meNmyFLEA,2,Tue Jul 21 00:11:38 2015 UTC,"I did it in a slow way, I gradually added browner foils to my bleached hair, so my hair was a mix of blonde and brunette. Then I let it grow out quite a bit, but the regrowth wasn't super ugly because of the brown foils mixed in, then went in for the ombre and now it's just fades into blonde."
FancyFollicles,3e03qc,APerfectCircle0,2,Tue Jul 21 08:47:36 2015 UTC,"Yes! I'm naturally dark blonde as well, and at one point I had one side my natural color and the other side bleached. I also got sick of the upkeep and decided to go for an ombre with my natural color on top and bleached on the bottom. I didn't trust myself to even it out though so I went to a stylist, and it turned out great!"
FancyFollicles,3dwisj,Ladydevann,4,Mon Jul 20 03:02:22 2015 UTC,"If you put coconut oil on your hair like an hour before you bleach, then put the bleach right on top of the coconut oil, it will help protect. I did a bunch of bleach baths to my hair and always had coconut oil on under the bleach and also a lot of coconut deep conditioning treatments in between. When I was to afraid to go any further on my own, went to a salon and they were shocked at how healthy my hair was. So they took me platinum and my hair is a little dry by no worse for wear than before."
FancyFollicles,3dwisj,awkward_thunder,3,Mon Jul 20 04:28:27 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but I've heard of using coconut oil before bleaching to minimise damage, and also using a bleach bath for a more gentle lightening. Yesterday I was wondering if both could be combined and still be effective. Your comment sounds like  coconut oil under a bleach bath does work? I'm already a bleached blonde but I need to lighten it up a bit more so I can get pastel purple but I'm concerned about damaging the parts of my hair that are already quiet light. Any tips on making it work? This will be my first at home bleaching"
FancyFollicles,3dwisj,dinkykate,2,Mon Jul 20 07:28:00 2015 UTC,"Yes the bleach penetrates through the oil. Speaking from experience. I always oil up before bleaching but since it is bleach we are talking about, damage will probably still be had. Just know that."

FancyFollicles,3dwisj,dinkykate,2,Mon Jul 20 11:25:26 2015 UTC,"I put coconut oil on my hair, like really saturated it. Then after an hour did a bleach bath. My hair was a few different colors when I started so it was hard to get even results on my own but it did lighten and it was less damaging."

FancyFollicles,3dwisj,suite-dee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:33:01 2015 UTC,"I love your hair! I agree, coconut oil is nice. Other options- a standalone kit from Amazon is about 25 dollars, and I got Olaplex as a standalone treatment for only 20 dollars at a local salon. I liked going to the salon more because there wasn't enough solution in the box to cover my whole head, and at the salon, they used as much as my hair needed."
