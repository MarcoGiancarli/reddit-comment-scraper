I only notice it more now because of this sub, but I think you'll see Adidas tracksuits all over Europe (France especially), and people sometimes squat when there is nowhere to sit.

Squatting wasn't a thing of some social class or standard, we just did it so our pants wouldn't get dirty. If my legs are tired from standing up and there isn't a bench around I will squat. I still squat in US today. I don't remember seeing a lot tracksuits, maybe it was too early for them or something, but they were not associated with anything other than something comfortable to wear, at least in my town. What I do remember are the ""raspberry jackets"". They were associated with ""new Russian""; something like ""new money"" and usually associated with criminal businessman or mafia."

The squatting itself isn't probably perceived as something as cringy as fedoras, though non-thugs are probably much less likely to do it.

How does your friend move? I've only seen those of Slavic descent remain stationary while they bend at the knee. However, these squats are sometimes accompanied with hand signals.

The result - most easy to buy brands are the only known ones.   In the last years of Soviet Union the Adidas set was priced at roughly a month salary of engineer which made it a status symbol. There was a well known proverb Every female will sleep with Adidas wearer (Если носишь Адидас тебе любая баба даст).

slavs_squatting,34unza,Jew_Fucker_69,47,Mon May 4 18:32:15 2015 UTC,"that guy is an absolute and utter hippy  but he is at least correct about the deep squat. it's a natural human resting position, just years of chair dependancy have left most of us in the west with chronically shortened calves and shitty hips so it takes a long time to learn to do it and then learn to relax into it  i fucked up the tendons in my shin practicing it, haven't been able to get back to it in weeks."
slavs_squatting,34unza,mordiepants,9,Mon May 4 20:10:46 2015 UTC,"I have no problem getting really deep. Almost to the floor. But my ankles seem to not be stretching as much as I thought they would have by now, I can't put my feet flat. Squatting is super comfortable but that is annoying. Any way to improve it?"
slavs_squatting,34unza,Muffikins,8,Mon May 4 22:52:21 2015 UTC,Keep doing it :-)  A trick that's been helping me is keep the heels on the ground and use a wall or something to prop up against so you don't tip back. Once in this position you can gradually build up the ankle mobility to do it without the wall. I found stretching in-context much more helpful than just stretching my calves independently and then hoping it would benefit the squat position.
slavs_squatting,34unza,Illah,3,Mon May 4 23:45:10 2015 UTC,"as illah says, keep doing it  http://kitlaughlin.com/Master_Series_PDFs/Master-the-Squat.pdf some stretches here that might help  and the same dude has a video series for 10 dollars https://vimeo.com/ondemand/mts about the deep squat.  i got it, it looks very good but as I said, injured myself so haven't got back to it  if you have any dumbell or barbell plates you can sit your heels on them to simulate ankle mobility you don't have yet, it's what i was doing and it was working very well. just make sure you keep your weight down through your heels, i was leaning forward too much using my shins to support my weight and that's just too much for those puny little things.  either way just do it and do it and do it. im pretty sure keeping the heels to the ground is critical though. so as low as you can go with heels raised, i dont think that will help an awful lot. go down as low as you can with heels planted and stay there as long as you can, then rest for a while and do it again. like any sort of stretching/flexibility training progress will come disgustingly slow, but it will come."

slavs_squatting,34unza,JustZisGuy,6,Wed May 6 18:27:43 2015 UTC,are you squatting ass to grass keeping your heels on the ground at all times?

EDIT: Looking at the video of the hippie dude, it sure looks like his ass is hovering slightly above the ground."
slavs_squatting,34unza,JustZisGuy,3,Wed May 6 18:32:41 2015 UTC,"ass to grass is just a phrase that means ass as low as you can get it, not just parralell thighs  well, congrats i guess. many people in the west can't do that without lots of stretching and mobility work."

What makes it difficult... is it that the thighs are too tight?"
slavs_squatting,34unza,JustZisGuy,3,Wed May 6 18:39:52 2015 UTC,"the three major sticking points for most people are ankle/calves, hips and hamstrings can be a factor as well  i have incredibly tight calves so my heels jump up off the ground at the slightest provocation whenever I try it, unless I spend a while foam rolling and stretching hard before hand.  when i was practising it regularly I had to rest my heels on dumbbell plates to simulate the ankle mobility I just didn't have and even then I still had to foam roll/warm up and stretch my calves or it was bloody murder."

slavs_squatting,34unza,mordiepants,8,Mon May 4 23:24:11 2015 UTC,there's actually quite a bit of evidence that it's very bad for you. the smoking thing is probably hyperbole alright but then the hysterical panic about the dangers of smoking is pretty hyperbolic too so maybe the truth is somewhere in the middle
slavs_squatting,34unza,qwedswerty,5,Tue May 5 07:40:37 2015 UTC,"The comparison is a bit meh, but I think his idea is something like: If you sit 8h+ per day, or very long stretches of sitting without standing up at all, then that is worse than being a smoker. Obviously, 5 minutes of smoking is worse than 5 minutes of sitting. But it's like... Are you a ""heavy sitter"" or a ""heavy smoker""? Heavy sitter might actually be worse for you. The comparison to smoking is quite popular for these health things, as everybody knows about those dangers already.   It's not a hyperbole, it's just that you are comparing two things that are different in size when considered normal."

Here's how the life expectancy rates look for the United States vs. an assortment of slavic countries.  Only Slovenians live longer (by a fifth of a year), and if you combine squatting with vodka you end up with the life expectancy of a Russian:  80.0 Slovenia  79.8 United States  78.0 Czech Republic  77.5 Croatia  76.3 Slovakia  76.3 Poland   76.0 Bosnia and Herzegovina   75.0 Macedonia   74.5 Montenegro   74.5 Bulgaria  74.0 Serbia  72.5 Belarus  70.5 Russia  68.0 Ukraine   tl;dr: squatting reduces your overall life expectancy by as much as 12 years."

slavs_squatting,30yk1j,pawelte1,10,Wed Apr 1 12:05:13 2015 UTC,"Not on birch, but on the other trees it's called Pollarding. Pollarding is very popular in Europe, not so much elsewhere. When done correctly you cut back to a healthy node (where branches came out) and repeat this over time and makes a big callous knuckle with lots of skinny branches coming out. Think something like The Womping Willow from Harry Potter."

slavs_squatting,30yk1j,wuziwu,14,Wed Apr 1 15:37:22 2015 UTC,"Someone cut off all the side branches and the branches at the top so it was a straight pole. The small water sprouts that come out after the tree is wounded are what you see growing off of the tree. If you top a tree every year it kills the tree obviously. I have no Idea why anyone would do this, but then again I've been more confused by things in this sub in the past."
slavs_squatting,30yk1j,Futbol_Meatlong,5,Tue Mar 31 22:46:52 2015 UTC,"No, it doesn't killl the tree when done correctly. It's called pruning and should be done regularly on mature trees."
slavs_squatting,30yk1j,90shelby,3,Thu Apr 2 07:09:42 2015 UTC,"When pruning is done correctly the tree is not harmed.Topping trees is not pruning however. A tree can only sustain a lose of about 33% of its crown. There are definitely ways you could train a vigorous tree into a pole shape, by pruning every other year starting from the year of transplanting and leaving 66% of branches everytime you prune. Judging by the lack of all branches, the presence of watersprouts all the way up the tree, and the flat stub at the top of the trees in this picture the trees were not pruned. Watersprouts are not structurally stable and the ratio of sugar producing leaves to the amount of wood cells left to maintain after topping the trees means the tree is at the very least stressed and it's life shortened."

This staggered or contemporary style of squat will decrease the amount of creasing in your leathers by 50%.  If flexibility is the case make sure you are wearing appropriate loose, athletic style clothing (ie: track suits) to best guage your personal limits.   If you are still trying to pull off the classic squat use a counterweight such as a cigarette, beer bottle, or a potato(s) to help aid your balance. Its simple physics.  Best of luck"

slavs_squatting,2ywc1e,nb4hnp,3,Fri Mar 13 13:24:31 2015 UTC,I just have two small wood steps that I got for $20. Keep 'em at each side of the toilet.

Sitting doesn't completely stop the flow but it kind of partially crimps the end of the intestine. Squatting just opens up the flow better than sitting.

It doesn't have any sewer pipelines, just a deep hole which fills with poop until the hole is full after that a new toilet is build or poop pump out if it is possible. The fun things about this village toilet, it is always outside of the house so it is nice to take a shit at temperature below zero in the winter, it stinks awfully and each time you go there you have to gaze into the abyss of the shit.      Also such toilets used in many shitholes, not only PL/UA/RU.     Some says that it is healthier then sitting"
slavs_squatting,2ywc1e,rotoko,1 point,Sat Mar 14 09:59:14 2015 UTC,"Section 4. Disadvantages and health risks of article  Defecation postures:       The sitting position causes the defecating human to assume a narrow anorectal angle, which some people believe is obstructive and causes difficulty in emptying the bowels. Critics of this posture say that squatting is ""the only natural defecation posture"".   The sitting position can cause the defecating human to repeat the Valsalva maneuver many times and with great force, which may overload the cardiovascular system and cause defecation syncope. Sikirov also published 2004 study in which he compared the length of time needed to defecate using various postures, and concluded that the sitting defecation posture requires ""excessive expulsive effort compared to the squatting posture"".   A sitting posture may increase diverticulosis of the colon. The magnitude of straining during defecation is at least three times greater than with the squatting posture.

Also - because a lot of prisoners do this all day long because the prisons are barren with nothing to sit on.

I'm saying that working out generally puts people in a better mood or a more positive state of mind.   Boxing, you would destroy me. Running is thankfully something that comes very naturally to me, and despite me having long periods of not running a step the last couple years (most due to over doing it on running), it comes back very quickly when I do train. As I'm sure is similar with boxing, it's easier to get back into monster shape when the body has been there before. For me, that means that a few weeks of running gets me back to the near front of most local races, and a few months of running will get me competitive in the larger regional races."

Especially shoes, it's hard to flat foot squat comfortably when your shoes curve at the edges. Secondly, the moment you refer to someone or something as a nigger, you're already racist. So, no. They aren't. I'd say gypsies are closer to them than Slavs, by a long shot. Most steal, wear cheap clothing, have a bunch of children they can't support.

slavs_squatting,2t0av1,Yura_Gagarin,10,Tue Jan 20 02:41:36 2015 UTC,Do the heels have to be flat on the ground for a proper squat? I can't keep mine flat for more than a minute.
slavs_squatting,2t0av1,selassiepickney,10,Tue Jan 20 03:09:11 2015 UTC,"It is ankle flexablitity, if you keep stretching, you will be able to hold it for longer."
slavs_squatting,2t0av1,The_Watzeeni,2,Tue Jan 20 03:12:00 2015 UTC,Yup. You can also hold your arms (or something heavy if necessary) in front of you to balance until you can do without.
slavs_squatting,2t0av1,DamniForgot,7,Wed Jan 21 20:40:39 2015 UTC,"No, its not ankle flexibility. I am not an expert but it's the flexibility of all the leg muscles that's important for a proper squat. And yes, heels must be on the ground it's the only way to hold a squat for extended periods of time (beer and sunflower seeds are typically consumed in a Slavic squat)."
slavs_squatting,2t0av1,The_Watzeeni,12,Tue Jan 20 05:05:26 2015 UTC,"The slavic or third world (proper) squat uses tibialis, shin muscles, while western squat (heels up) squat uses calf muscles. The third world squat requires ankle flexablitily because it requires the shin to pull to the ground to stay balanced, while the western, the shins naturally fall."
slavs_squatting,2t0av1,marnches,5,Tue Jan 20 05:24:57 2015 UTC,"The western squat doesn't really tax the ""calf muscles"" any harder, it's a much more quad-dominant type of squatting. (Heels not touching the ground.)"

slavs_squatting,2svayl,Imbacile,60,Mon Jan 19 19:24:27 2015 UTC,"There is a thing called body culture, i.e. accepted ways to use your body. It's not about sex, it covers everything body does. For example, many cultures have a polite gesture to signalise for hosts that food was great, but enough already, i.e. burping. Many cultures are trearing burping as an offensive behavior.   Sitting posture is one aspect of body culture. North Europeans were traditionally sitting on raised surfaces (probably from a cold below). Indians are ok with lotus posture, while Japanese people prefer kneeling. Greeks and Romans of old mostly were lying on the sides, although they did chairs for some purposes. Tatars and Turks (who brought lots of customs to Slavic people) are perfectly ok with squatting.   As culture is a thing that causes people to act in a specific way unconsciously, it's just plain natural for Slavs (and Mongols, and tajicks and many others) to squat."
slavs_squatting,2svayl,Blipblipblipblipskip,22,Mon Jan 19 20:56:00 2015 UTC,Dated a Mongolian woman. She had a flawless Slavic squat
slavs_squatting,2svayl,willmonkeyu,10,Thu Jan 22 15:44:11 2015 UTC,Indians squat far more than they sit in the lotus position.
slavs_squatting,2svayl,Imbacile,9,Sat Jan 24 21:52:19 2015 UTC,Yep. Yet they are basically only ones who can do lotus at will.
slavs_squatting,2svayl,riggorous,74,Sat Jan 24 22:17:52 2015 UTC,"In America we're taught to sit cross legged   We are?  The slav squat is what you do whenever you have to spend a lot of time in an environment that is dirty, so you can't sit on the ground, but which also doesn't have any chairs or other suitable surfaces. The squat (make sure to keep your heels on the ground tho or it's not kosher) is optimal in that situation, because it's actually quite comfortable and doesn't tire out your muscles or cut off circulation in your legs. Slavic dudebros in fake Adidas trackies do this a lot because there aren't a lot of chairs in former USSR, but a lot of dirty places, so I guess it's become their default pose now."
slavs_squatting,2svayl,koryface,60,Sun Jan 18 23:00:49 2015 UTC,In school we were constantly made to sit crossed legged. In any situation where I don't have a chair I just sit cross legged and brush off my butt when I stand up. Squatting is incredibly uncomfortable to me and I'd probably never do it unless I was exhausted and wearing a nice suit or something I really didn't want to get dirty.
slavs_squatting,2svayl,FedorableGentleman,55,Sun Jan 18 23:18:49 2015 UTC,It's uncomfortable because most Westerners lack flexibility in certain muscles from sitting too much.
slavs_squatting,2svayl,SleepyConscience,22,Mon Jan 19 00:26:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I actually had to stretch the shit out of my hips to be able to do a barbell squat right when I started weightlifting. Americans just don't squat at all and are super tight in those muscles. I can now, finally, squat down and actually put my heels on the ground, but it's still close and not that comfortable."
slavs_squatting,2svayl,GoFidoGo,10,Mon Jan 19 04:16:03 2015 UTC,It also puts a lot more weight/ pressure on the knees. Whenever I squat I feel like my blood flow in my legs is constricted.

slavs_squatting,2svayl,localchicken,26,Tue Jan 27 03:22:41 2015 UTC,"Here's your daily dose of internet advice: if squatting is uncomfortable for you, you need to work out more. The squat is one of the most natural human movements, and that you feel constrained in it shows that your leg muscles are underdeveloped and possibly your flexibility needs work.   But, like, I know what you mean about school, but I can't say that I regularly see people in America sitting with their butts on the pavement or on the grass somewhere. Plus, developing countries are generally a lot, A LOT dirtier than America."
slavs_squatting,2svayl,riggorous,17,Sun Jan 18 23:24:34 2015 UTC,"Plus, developing countries are generally a lot, A LOT dirtier than America.   Depends where you are in the states, and where in the developing world."

slavs_squatting,2svayl,SleepyConscience,7,Mon Jan 19 02:29:48 2015 UTC,"Muscular development is the basic cause for any discomfort in movement. Like, sometimes it hurts for people to sit up straight, but it's not because of scoliosis or flexibility or anything - it's because they don't typically sit up straight, so the appropriate muscles are underdeveloped and tire fast. Or, you know, you can't run far without stopping because your heart isn't developed to do that."
slavs_squatting,2svayl,PitBullTherapy,8,Thu Jan 22 01:45:19 2015 UTC,In school we were constantly made to sit crossed legged   This. It was constantly beat into us. This is why I'm wondering if the squat is also their natural position for clean surfaces.

Well, I can tell you this certainly USED to be commonly ""taught"" -- not a formal thing mind you (there was never some ""5 step instructional pictogram"" hung up in kindergarten) -- but it was something that was expected/demonstrated at a very early age, and apparently has been for a long time.  My understanding is that (like a lot of things we don't necessarily realize) we basically learned it from Native Americans -- where it seems to have been commonly used by people sitting in a circle... in the woods or on a beach around a campfire or within teepee or lodge -- and probably because it facilitates passing a ""peace pipe"" around; and back in the day it was always called ""Indian style"" (feathers not dots), but that phrase probably isn't used any more since it's not P.C.

(I'm from the US and live in Russia so I have a bit of both perspective) here's the thing: Russians, at least from my experience, are taught that outside is really dirty, and it's quite shameful to get your clothes dirty so they squat- also they have a lot of superstitions about the cold, one being: if you sit on a cold surface youre going to get a bladder infection or injure your kidneys- again, saving themselves by squatting.

In parts of Asia, many rural people will just sit around and shoot the breeze in this position. In the West, we are taught to rely on chairs from a young age, and as a result most people are far too stiff for that. But with practice, you'll get used to deep squatting very quickly."
slavs_squatting,2qxqir,Komalt,9,Thu Jan 1 16:49:44 2015 UTC,"Well it's really not true that only Slavs do it, in fact as a Slav I was confused when this became popular on the internet.  It's just a joke and many many other cultures enjoy squatting especially in Asia and the Middle East.  It's just funnier to see a Slav do it, rather than perhaps a poor man in Pakistan."
slavs_squatting,2qxqir,uno_sir_clan,31,Thu Jan 1 21:24:27 2015 UTC,"Sitting on a ground, even if it's inside, is frowned upon in Russia (at least when I was growing up 80s-90s).

slavs_squatting,2qxqir,Penis-Butt,20,Thu Jan 1 18:08:18 2015 UTC,So it's to avoid getting their tracksuits dirty! Now we just need to find out why they wear tracksuits... Maybe it's because they're comfortable to squat in.

slavs_squatting,2qxqir,GeneralDisorder,5,Thu Jan 1 05:52:51 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly certain squatting developed in several areas for the same reason. It's a restful way to...exist, I guess. It doesn't take much energy. If you need to be in one place for a long time, you want to sit down. However, if there are no chairs/it's cold etc etc, you don't want to touch the ground. Thus, squatting allows you t get most of the benefits of sitting, while still only having your feet touch the ground so nothing gets dirty."

The movement was in favour of art as a practice for social purposes. Constructivism had a great effect on modern art movements of the 20th century, influencing major trends such as the Bauhaus and De Stijl movements. Its influence was pervasive, with major impacts upon architecture, graphic and industrial design, theatre, film, dance, fashion and to some extent music.    Image i - Zuev Workers' Club, 1928.

Cubism has been considered the most influential art movement of the 20th century.  The term is broadly used in association with a wide variety of art produced in Paris (Montmartre, Montparnasse and Puteaux) during the 1910s and extending through the 1920s.  The movement was pioneered by Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso, joined by Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Robert Delaunay, Henri Le Fauconnier, Fernand Léger and Juan Gris.  A primary influence that led to Cubism was the representation of three-dimensional form in the late works of Paul Cézanne.  A retrospective of Cézanne's paintings had been held at the Salon d'Automne of 1904, current works were displayed at the 1905 and 1906 Salon d'Automne, followed by two commemorative retrospectives after his death in 1907.   In Cubist artwork, objects are analyzed, broken up and reassembled in an abstracted form—instead of depicting objects from one viewpoint, the artist depicts the subject from a multitude of viewpoints to represent the subject in a greater context.

From the early 6th century they spread to inhabit most of Central and Eastern Europe and Southeast Europe.  Slavic groups also ventured as far as Scandinavia, constituting elements amongst the Vikings;   while at the other geographic extreme, Slavic mercenaries fighting for the Byzantines and Arabs settled Asia Minor and even as far as Syria.  Later, East Slavs (specifically, Russians and Ukrainians) colonized Siberia  and Central Asia.  Every Slavic ethnicity has emigrated to other parts of the world.

After a point more expensive things get you diminishing returns.  EDIT: For instance, my dad has a $400 knife and I have an $80 knife. His knife is made out of harder steel, so it requires sharpening less often. A lot less often. But in the end, they both do knife things and there isn't much difference in day-to-day performance, just that his should last longer and doesn't require as much maintenance.  But, as I don't have the money, the improvement from $80 to $400 really isn't worth it, since both knives perform the same."

slavs_squatting,2o46oo,jibnique,5,Wed Dec 3 03:33:18 2014 UTC,"Here's the Urban Dictionary definition of nammer squat :      A feat most often seen performed by asian males of vietnamese, ""bukky"", laos, and cambodian decent. It's a unique stance whereby the asian male must first be wearing a sheer Versace shirt, Kappa track pants, and Nike Shox before attempting the aforementioned maneuver.  With a cigarette in one hand and a can of Coors light in the other (or bubbletea if under 14), the asian male will then lower its body, bending deep at the knees and their buttocks no higher than 1 inch from the ground, grass, floor, chair, toilet seat, pool hall stool, arcade stool, table, bus-stop bench, park bench, workout bench, diving board or newspaper bin (yes, it has been witnessed).  With the bent legs shoulder-width apart, the asian male's centre of gravity is perfectly balanced with the extended arms resting comfortably on the knees. the key here is their flat-footed posture which cannot be duplicated by caucasian males, who often need to resort to the less impressive  ""raised-heels"" squat and end up with sore knee joints and weak balance.  When properly executed, the asian male has been known to stay in that position for the duration of an entire rave party, especially when squatting in front of the main speakers with a crew of 20 other asian males. The Nike shox are knowned to be interchanged with a pair of refugee-grade sandals, while a suitable substitution for the Versace shirt can be either Moschino, Hugo Boss, Armani, J. Lindeberg, or D&G. Kappa track pants MUST be worn to correctly perform the nammer squat.     That dude pulled a nammer squat right in the middle of the dancefloor.  Tommy told Tony not to mess with Johnny's girlfriend, so Tony pulled a nammer squat while devising a plan to cap Johnny.    about | flag for glitch | Summon: urbanbot, what is something?"

slavs_squatting,2hgzrq,nb4hnp,22,Tue Dec 30 22:05:29 2014 UTC,"anyone know what they are eating?   I am glad to talk about this topic. As an expert in Slav- and Bullshitology I have some experience with the classic meal setup, especially in places that are culturally closer to Russia.   What we see in this picture is a classic case of ""Tarmazok"", the literal bread and butter for any long or short trip. You can think of it as a traditional western picnic, where you pack in both prepared meals and components thereof to create a ""small"" buffet.   Blue collar workers for example, sometimes pool their efforts for a balanced out meal during their break because a meal in Slavic nations is not just a means to eat one's fill but also to socially bond and exchange. While you see western people often keeping to themselves or limit themselves to smalltalk in large and empty halls during lunch breaks, a slavic group of workers will use this time to socialise much more.  A typical takeaway meal consists usually of loaves of bread (called ""bulka"") which are manually sliced on-site with a brought knife, several types of local sausage (""kalbaska""), fresh or pickled pickles (""ogurchiki"") and other vegetables like tomatoes, basil and green leek with salt, as well as occasionally fish and/or potatoes. Beverages ranging from water, over juices and softdrinks to the mandatory ""glatochik"", a gulp of spirits of choice to wash it all down are also available. The meals are usually transported in cheap, white plastic bags, which is the reason you see them so often. They are practical in that you can use them as underlayment for the dishes.  Classic traditions are short toasts, roaring laughter, politically and otherwise socially unacceptable topics, at least one heated argument that almost results in a fight (even when it is a group of women) and the spiel of urging someone to take another bite of that dish because you look like bones and skin or finish up this dish so we don't need to pack it up again (usually initiated by mothers or wives towards husbands, sons and other male members of the family or even friends).  If you have any more questions, feel free to ask."
slavs_squatting,2hgzrq,geek180,3,Fri Sep 26 13:37:21 2014 UTC,Why are they in an abandoned building?
slavs_squatting,2hgzrq,Not_KGB_Col_Vlad,9,Fri Sep 26 16:55:19 2014 UTC,"Could be multiple reasons. They might be part of a construction crew on their lunchbreak or decided to meet up and have a bite in one of the many abandoned and unfinished buildings of the ex-Soviet Union states. The ex-Soviet Union States were part of a huge nation that spanned more than half the globe. There are bound to be many abandoned places or government projects that ended up unfinished.  As I said, eating with your friends and family is a huge social aspect and maybe these guys decided to just roam around in an abandoned building, maybe tearing walls down with a sledgehammer for fun or honing their shitty grafitty skills. After a hard days work, eating with your slavic friends is a great way to round off the day!"

Sadly, he likely had to step down after he was done, to allow the other customers to pay.
