It would've been big news if NOT Nelson was put in. The precedent for succession is that the President of the 12 becomes the new prophet; therefore, the President of the 12 is always the second-most senior apostle (most senior is President of the Church). This was true even when Monson was in the FP; he was officially President of the 12, but Packer was ""Acting President of the 12"", assuming Monson's duties since he was in the FP.  Nelson is awesome. I doubt he'll outlive Monson but I bet he'd make a great prophet."

I assume it is OK.  The transcript of this was never available on BYU Speeches, but the audio used to be. As a diligent Church member, I have been maintaining a personal archive of these talks for more than a decade now. That means that I have the audio! If anyone wants to transcribe and share, it'd be appreciated.  I'm sharing this talk particularly for this quote:   Civil disobedience has become fashionable for a few with strongly held political agendas. Even when causes are meritorious, if civil disobedience were to be practiced by everyone with a cause our democracy would unravel and be destroyed. Civil disobedience is an abuse of political process in a democracy. . . . Recently I heard a new convert to our Church urge that the Church resort to civil disobedience and violence because of the moral wrongness of abortion. The position of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints opposing abortion is longstanding and well-known. I told him that it was our belief that even though we disagreed with the law, and even though we counseled our people strongly against abortion, and even though we bring into question the membership of those involved in abortion, we are still obliged to recognize the law of the land until it is changed. His response was, “Even if it is wrong?” I tried to explain that when we disagree with a law, rather than resort to civil disobedience or violence, we are obliged to exercise our right to seek its repeal or change by peaceful and lawful means.   This perspective has been valuable to me since I first heard this talk. County clerks that refuse to honor the law of the land in issuing marriage certificates to same-sex couples should know about these statements and act while considering them. It is probably incumbent upon clerks that feel complying with the law would constitute moral violation to resign their positions."

lds,3cqdxa,gillyboatbruff,6,Fri Jul 10 04:57:40 2015 UTC,"I couple notes from the article.  It referenced a New Jersey court ruling about a church affiliated organization that was sued for declining an application to use its shoreside pavilion for a same-sex wedding.  The court filing explains it better, but it basically explains that they were advertising it and using it as a public gathering place and obtaining a non-religious, non-profit tax exemption for it which clearly prevented them from declining access for the requested marriage.  They could have, and should have, applied for a tax exemption that was religious in nature.  As far as our churches getting sued for the same thing, I think any suits would be dismissed with minimal cost to the church.  I don't know much about the details of that process or even how our insurance works.  I don't see anything in the article that would indicate we should fear.  Regarding that Oregon baker that got sued, I kind of think that's a messy situation from all angles.  My conclusion from that situation is that if society is going to define declining for-profit service from gay people as discrimination, then we need to abide by that definition.  Personally, I think the Christ-like thing to do is to run your wedding business without discriminating.  True marriage isn't a contract or agreement between 2 people.  It's a sacred covenant between God, a man, and a woman.  If you're going to run a wedding business that services people entering into a 2 way contract, then what eternal difference does it really make if it's 1 man and 1 woman, or same-sex?  Of course, we have an obligation to educate the world and be vocal in our support of the authorized, eternal practice of marriage and families, but there are ways to do that which actually educate, rather than divide.  If you want to do that through a wedding business, you can include a statement of your faith in your advertising, for example.  I don't even really think it would be appropriate to do this in a way of discouraging anyone, but instead as a way of inviting people to learn more about the plan of salvation.  Any time we say ""shall not"" to people who don't believe what we believe, we aren't being good member missionaries.  It's far better to start with an explanation of eternal happiness and let people come to the gospel that way."

Would you bake a cake for the KKK to celebrate a lynching? We all believe certain forms of discrimination are justified under some circumstances. To many people, homosexual acts are deeply immoral--it seems to me that forcing them to use their artistic talents to celebrate such an act is profoundly wrong.   I agree that some people are probably overstating the odds that the Church will be forced to conduct gay weddings at gunpoint. But when a Catholic hospital is forced to distribute birth control, and when the Obama administration's attorneys have essentially admitted that religious universities could loose funding for failing to toe the line on gay marriage, I don't think we should be too quick to downplay the overall threat to religious liberty."

Whenever we become financially dependent on the government (which the institutions you mentioned certainly are), we open ourselves up to being forced to operate according to the morality of the world.  It's fine to take money from the government, but we should remain prepared to lose that.  This probably isn't related, but if the country radically shifted to being anti-religious in nature and the church lost its tax-exempt status, would that cripple us?  It would certainly cause us to be able to do far less than we do, but we'd adapt.  Our present guidance is to be vigilant toward the potential loss of religious liberty.  I take that prophetic instruction seriously.  But, I also take the (also prophetic) instruction to disagree without being disagreeable very seriously.  By the way, my nature is to not follow either of those counsels.  I'd much rather just let the world do whatever it wants and keep to myself, but I recognize that's not what Christ taught."

It is abundantly clear very few homosexuals oppose same sex marriage. The vast majority of LGBT people, support same sex marriage rights. Using stories like this as an example to say ""See, even gay people think marriage should be between a man and a woman"" is painfully unrepresentative of the larger LGBT opinion.  My point is not that members should support same sex marriage. If you want to oppose it, fine. But this is quite possibly the weakest argument that can be made.

While I agree with /u/JonLocke that some of his philosophies about how we should treat others are good, I vehemently disagree that government force and coercion is the way to go about that. Christ invited us to use our agency and follow him. Government taxes and programs bind us and force us to do good which violates agency and really doesn't bring us any closer to actually being Christlike (would we be more Christlike by creating a government mandate to attend church; are we more Christlike by creating a government mandate through taxes to care for the poor).

And it wouldn't be forced more than other laws if a candidate supporting it is elected through a democratic process."
lds,3cadza,ElkanahLinnell,3,Tue Jul 7 15:24:21 2015 UTC,"Mormons, unfortunately, are not always consistent between their faith and their practice, even in big things. It's sad but we are an imperfect people. That's what I often point out and am often told I am wrong, deluded, overly-idealistic, etc. over.   You're right that many Mormons advocate for force on gay marriage and abortion. Here's my thoughts. Again, not necessarily representative but possibly.  Gay Marriage: Government force was used by Congress in the Morrill Anti-Bigamy act in 1862 that imposed some people's view of morality on others, including Mormons. We didn't appreciate it then. In fact, we actively fought it and even engaged in civil disobedience over it. Then, we fell in line (after being commanded by God to cease the practice) and somehow then started agreeing that government force was ok to enforce marriage laws. Now, we are reaping what we sowed in having government force around marriage laws with which we disagree imposed, once again, on us. At some point, maybe it would have been better to leave marriage in churches where it used to be.  Abortion: Many libertarians say that abortion should be allowed. However, I disagree and feel it should be outlawed except in cases where the mother's life is at risk (not just health). Why is it ok to use force there? You are taking a life. Now, I know many people argue about when life begins. IF we say that life begins at birth (to go with extremes) and are wrong, we are guilty of murder and of victimizing the most vulnerable people in existence. IF we say that life begins at conception and are wrong, then we have brought some children into the world unnecessarily. The risks hardly seem even. Erring on protecting life seems logical. Therefore, force to prevent abortion is reasonable as you are preventing force in the form of murder.  As for it being less forceful if a candidate is elected, you're right. It isn't any more force than other laws. Does that make it right? If in a village of 100 people, 51 of them vote together to take 50% of everyone's paychecks whether they agree to it or not, then it's ok because it was democratic? Imagine this as your neighborhood. Would you be ok with it? When the majority rules, the minority suffers. Force is force even if we think the end results are good or noble."
lds,3cadza,ElkanahLinnell,2,Tue Jul 7 23:04:54 2015 UTC,"You are saying force is force even if the end result is noble, but aren't all laws force and still, why are tax-laws any worse than any other law?   In regards to abortion you argue that it's better to err on the side of protecting life. Following that same reasoning I think voting for higher taxes for the rich (or in general, either way the richest will pay more cause they have more) is pretty much the same thing, because life should be about more than just staying alive, it should be having hope and a future, something that is in many ways denied many when you for instance don't have free education or free healthcare.  When you say that 51% vs 49% isn't fair in democracy then you are right, democracy isn't perfect, but it's the best system we have.   You say that when the majority rules the minority suffers, but from what I can see now it is actually currently the opposite in the US, it seems like the minority, (1%) rules and the minority (the 99%) suffers. How is that right? Should we then not to our best to vote for candidates who will pass laws that will benefit the majority? Especially when that majority is the people without a lot of money and without any power?   Taxing the rich more won't even make them ""suffer"" they'll still be rich (and they won't have to pay for school or healthcare either, although I guess they will because they will want higher standards than what will be publicly funded)! But it will give others who are not starting out with the same privileges a fighting chance to create a good and worthy life for themselves.  I'd rather err on that.   Unfortunately I can't vote as I'm not from the US :)   But yeah, the attitude I've seen from many US Mormons against welfare has always confused me."

Yes, all laws are force, including tax laws. They aren't necessarily better or worse than other laws. I believe that you cannot, by majority vote, give anyone the right to do something that you yourself can't do. I can certainly choose to assign my right to self-defense to another (i.e.: police when enforcing laws against assault, sexual crimes, etc). It is an extension of my own power to do the same thing. I cannot walk into my neighbors house and take their money. I don't believe it is necessarily moral for me to decide with a bunch of others that we as a group can do that. Now, that is the system we live in and I have to work within it. But that doesn't mean I have to support furthering and expanding it.   In regards to abortion you argue that it's better to err on the side of protecting life. Following that same reasoning I think voting for higher taxes for the rich (or in general, either way the richest will pay more cause they have more) is pretty much the same thing, because life should be about more than just staying alive, it should be having hope and a future, something that is in many ways denied many when you for instance don't have free education or free healthcare.   When questioning whether murder is taking place, yes I say we err on the side of protecting life. You aren't talking about life itself. You are talking about quality of life. There is no such thing as ""free"" anything. It is paid by someone. You cannot have a right to something that someone else must do or perform. That does not mean I think only rich people should have healthcare and education. All it means is that none of us have an inherent right to it. See comments on charity below.   When you say that 51% vs 49% isn't fair in democracy then you are right, democracy isn't perfect, but it's the best system we have.   I'll argue that democracy is better than a dictatorship. Is it the best system we have? I don't know. I know that there were an awful lot of slaves and women and children that didn't feel democracy was all that great in the 1800s. There are a lot of minorities that still don't think it is that great. It (representative democracy) was the form of government that allowed the third reich to form and gain power. Democracy has been used to deprive many people of their rights and has caused (and in some ways continues to cause) immense suffering.  Again, it beats a lot of other things but let's be honest about it's pervasive, persistent, and at times deep flaws.   You say that when the majority rules the minority suffers, but from what I can see now it is actually currently the opposite in the US, it seems like the minority, (1%) rules and the minority (the 99%) suffers. How is that right? Should we then not to our best to vote for candidates who will pass laws that will benefit the majority? Especially when that majority is the people without a lot of money and without any power?   There are way too many laws for us to lump into four-sentence, generalized arguments. Are we talking economic laws? Social justice laws? Environmental laws?  I am all for eliminating corruption and self-serving interests from government. It needs to happen. Using laws to benefit one class of people, particularly at the expense of others, are immoral and should be done away with. However, in other areas, we are in the position we are in because the majority votes to enact laws that benefit the majority. Such as the government enforcement of heterosexual, monogamous marriage. By using the force of the state to dictate what relationships can be legitimized and gain preferential government treatment, we have created the ""gay rights"" movement.   Again, I think we will find it impossible to discuss any of this well due to the immense volume and variety of laws to which either of us could be referring.   Taxing the rich more won't even make them ""suffer"" they'll still be rich (and they won't have to pay for school or healthcare either, although I guess they will because they will want higher standards than what will be publicly funded)!    It is still theft. Using your logic, it is ok for someone to steal from you as long as they have less than you have because you'll still be better off than them.   But it will give others who are not starting out with the same privileges a fighting chance to create a good and worthy life for themselves. I'd rather err on that.   You are right that privilege is not equal. Life is not equal. It is not fair. But forcing people to give away their belongings and property to support a cause you believe in is hardly fair either. Show me that in scripture. Where is that shown as moral?   But yeah, the attitude I've seen from many US Mormons against welfare has always confused me.   Your conflation of welfare with government welfare is part of the misunderstanding. I don't claim to be representative of most US Mormons and, like you, I take issue with many of their stances. However, government welfare is inefficient and immoral.   Welfare and charity generally is another thing entirely. Christ didn't encourage us to band together, pass laws to take money from people, and then do good with that money. He encouraged us to give of ourselves. I give to several charities (including the church). I work for myself as a marriage therapist and do in excess of $10k a year in pro bono work. I am all for rallying together as a community to help those who are less fortunate or privileged. That is Christianity and Mormonism. Passing laws force others to treat people right isn't.  If you are truly interested in learning more about this perspective, I'd suggest reading Boyack's Latter-day Liberty and his second book, Latter-day Responsibility. They do a fantastic job of outlining the philosophical and religious reasoning behind this paradigm."

lds,3cadza,itoomustgive,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:02:07 2015 UTC,"Everything. As in, I don't see paying taxes as forcing me to be moral at all, I simply see is as a way to ensure that everyone is able to thrive.   Good for you in seeing it that way. The problem is that some of us don't. See my comments about charity above (and the conflation of government charity vs voluntary charity). If I disagree with how where the money is being spent, feel it is being mismanaged, feel it would be more effective elsewhere, I can't stop paying it. And that is where the force comes in.   I can't think of anyone who whouldn't want that as an objective. Charging taxes in order to pay for common goods (like Education, healthcare, policing, defense or roads), things that everyone needs in order to live healthily in a society, is somehow wrong.   Well, you can now. Go spend some time browsing /r/Libertarian. And not everything you list is bad. I, personally, have no problem paying taxes towards defense (or rather I wouldn't have a problem if it was actually used for defense instead of pre-emptive war and world policing) and some policing (such as against assault, sexual assault, robbery, etc. rather than civil forfeiture, the drug war, etc.). We don't see any of the things you list as wrong but rather that those things being done as private business and private charities as more efficient and moral than using force to do it.   If people want to be a part of a community, then they need to contribute to that community, simple. And contributing to that community means ensuring that there is a safety net so that when people are going through a bad time, they can come back up.   You are conflating community and government. Not the same thing. Can't disagree about providing a safety net. Disagree about it having to be the government.   Anything other than that just sounds like something out of a dystopian science fiction novel.   Funny. The church has a safety net. Has since it was founded. No dystopian science fiction there."

President Benson laid this out in 1982, and how many members do we still have today who fight over these issues? We see now that the level of family destruction has only multiplied over the last 30 years, almost to the point of unrecognizability, but we still have many people who don't seem to grasp it, or seek to make excuses for it.  I just feel like we're drifting. I hope we get some help in nailing it down soon."
lds,3bw8ba,morajic,-2,Thu Jul 2 21:11:45 2015 UTC,"Maybe this isn't appropriate for such a public forum. I'll try to limit my comments appropriately, because then again maybe they are.  Given my position and such, I can see some things that most lay members will never see. My stake president sees more, as do the 70s and apostles and the prophet himself. It's a benefit of being on the ""watchtower"", so to speak. The people on the ""ground"" cannot see what the people on the tower can see. They are relying on the people in the watchtower being honest and clear.  The church is always going through a process. Remember the purpose of the church is to bring people to Christ. Remember that as people approach Christ, he shows them their weaknesses. He shows us weakness so that we become humble. When we become humble, he can demonstrate his power through us.  There are countless people who are fully committed to the gospel. You hardly see them as a lay member, often times because they are too busy ministering to the weak and also they consider themselves humble. For instance, how often do you see the missionaries and get a chance to talk to them?  We are bringing people closer to Christ. It is working. It is working within the church and without. There are miracles too many to count, and that's only in my small corner of the kingdom. I hear of even greater miracles around us. The Lord is pouring out his blessings, blessings we could not even imagine!  The fallout of this is good news all around for the church. Testimonies are strengthened. Covenants are renewed. Convictions are firmed. Again, look at the leaders who can see the big picture. Ask yourself, ""Do they seem happy? Are they positive? Are they enthusiastic about the future?"" I say they are.  Of note, Elder Perry would sometimes say something that suggested he was sad for all the developments in the world, but around those comments were always comments of pure joy about the progress being made in and around the church. It's very, very hard to get depressed about the church when you see the big picture. What a marvelous age we live in, despite all the nonsense happening around us!  The youth! My brother, if you could see what I have seen about the youth of this generation! I am so excited for them. I am so excited for the lives they are changing by simply being who they are. I don't know how Satan ever thought he could win this with these youth who are coming up! They have firm testimonies. They know the Savior personally. They are learning how to minister directly from the Master himself. They are eager to serve! I feel like the Church has introduced the Come Follow Me curriculum because the youth were ready for something greater than what we had. They were ready for the meat. The time of feeding milk to our youth is over. They are ready for the higher law.  I wish I could show you all the wonderful things I see. Suffice it to say, the only sadness I have is because there are still people who would choose sin over God. That breaks my heart."

I think my ward (northern California) has a pretty even mix of moms who stay at home and moms who work.  There are many challenges to making this decision:  How many sacrifices are you willing to make regarding your lifestyle?  If you stay home, how much do you talk about it to your friends who work?  Once you start to see the blessings and know you've made the right choice, how do you keep from being judgmental toward those who've gone a different way, but still go to church?  Even if you're not judgmental, how do you help edify your ward family so they don't feel judged?  I'm very impressed at the skill that some people in my ward have of making others feel loved, even as they make far better decisions in their personal lives.

Hubby was in school for his degree. After the baby was born, we decided that whatever it took, I would be at home with kids. We now have 4 kids and I have been at home with them.   It hasn't been easy. We have lived in poverty, even living with my in-laws for a couple of years. Hubby worked and went to school, starting with a campus job and grants, then as a server at a local restaurant, then starting his own business. Even now, nine years later, we're paying back the debt we accrued while trying to stay afloat.  Now, hubby's job is enough to completely support us comfortably, with extras. And our children have been blessed by the fact that I am home with them. I obviously can't compare how they would have been if I had been working, but I think it's made a difference to them that I am always there. They've been able to participate in activities that they wouldn't otherwise and we have a very close relationship.  And I have been blessed in ways that I wouldn't have expected. I have been self-employed doing various things from home now for years. A couple of hours a week that still brings in some extra income. It was essential when we were dirt poor, but now, it's just something to keep me in the market, so to speak.

That's why the Church teaches that women should focus on bearing and nursing children, a thing only women can do, and then raising them, a thing women are uniquely qualified to do.  If, for some reason, some women are not able to achieve that ideal, it's not our place to judge them. The Lord will judge.

For instance, this site shows that babysitting in San Francisco can cost $14 an hour for one child.

SCOTUS decided Obergefell on the basis of orientation, and nobody's going to argue that traditional polygamy is structured around orientation--however, polyamorous people are already saying that they are oriented toward non-monogamous trios, quartets, etc. There's a very good chance that postmodern egalitarian polyamorous marriage will be recognized in the next fifteen years, but only a small chance that traditional polygamy (where men are allowed to be part of multiple distinct marriages) will become legal along with it."

Sexual orientation is not a federally protected status, or even a statewide one (with the exception of a few counties in Utah).  In theory, since BYU is a private university, they are free to discipline any student who is gay just as easily as they could discipline any student wearing a Utah Utes ballcap to class - and both examples would have no legal consequences on the university.   Things like ethnicity, age, gender, and mental/physical illnesses or disabilities are protected statues.

It enforces the same rights that the Constitution provides that protects our religious freedoms. The state cannot refuse a marriage license, but religious ceremonies may still be refused. Also, as long as a student upholds the standards at BYU, they're typically in the clear.   Living in Provo I've had high school friends and acquaintances go to BYU. They have good programs and support groups for those with same-sex tendencies. I think a few people don't feel coming out until they learn of or approach these groups. It's a very safe environment for it.   With recommendation from church leaders like bishops or stake presidents non-members will be accepted as long as they dress/live/behave to the school's morals and code.   I feel that BYU and it's standards is respected enough that there's not really a chance or even cause for reprimanding in any immediate future. Particularly as it's a private school.   Is your concern that this ruling will simply lead to more and more rulings that will cause a problem? Because as my wife, parents, and I see it, the whole thing is good practice of constitutional rights and government action against BYU like that would be infringing on the same constitutional rights that got the ruling passed anyway.   Both my dad and my wife's dad are decent legal/constitution/church buffs so I'll run it by them. One is a veteran and church figure, the other has been a very proactive bishop with young adults that works at BYU right now. There's a man in my ward who's whole family we've known for decades that's on the admissions committee there, too, if things get complicated. I think he may have been one of my dad's counselors."

The imposition of taxes would substantially burden the operation of the university, and tuition would likely have to be raised a good bit to offset it.

The government can't require BYU to rewrite its honor code, or force the church to perform same-sex marriages.

There's nothing wrong with you doing this, and they'll be delighted to help you learn the skills you'll need in your marriage before you get married, rather than a year or two into the marriage when things are much more difficult. Might be something to wait until you're engaged, but I recommend it (and our marriage counselor does too)."

It's not an LDS book, and sometimes it borders on pop-sci, but I found it very effective with helping me define certain things that are very important to me.  Once these things are defined, it is easier to understand how the relationship, and parenting, should work out."
lds,3bap4d,allbeefpatties,3,Sun Jun 28 20:16:09 2015 UTC,"My wife and I made up a ""random question game.""  Basically, you ask a random question and use that as a launching pad for a conversation.  Questions can be serious (""What is your stance on _____?), whimsical (""What kind of toothpaste do you use?""), extremely personal (""Were you ever abused as a child?""), spiritual, political, whatever.  But I'll give you a hint: it's the whimsical ones that work best.  They launch into the more interesting conversations, and you learn the most about each other.  Too many serious questions is draining and not always fun.  Ask about most embarrassing moments.  Traditions growing up.  Rules your parents had.  Favorite foods.  Getting bullied at school.  Dream jobs.  Retirement.  Favorite vacation.  Worst church calling.  Hobbies.  Recurring dreams.  The rules: you ask a question, your SO responds, conversation (hopefully) follows.  Then, you must also answer the question.  That makes it more fair, and often getting a different perspective on the same topic is fun.  Then your SO gets to choose the next question.  Repeat.  No question is off limits.  If you don't feel comfortable asking the question or answering it, that's a problem you need to resolve.  Nothing should be secret between spouses.  This isn't something you specifically sit down to do.  Play the game when you're waiting in lines or driving in the car.  Use it to fill gaps in conversations.  And remember, the point usually isn't the answer itself, but the conversation that follows.  Who cares that you prefer Crest?  But the life story that lead there can be fascinating."
lds,3bap4d,smacktaix,2,Sun Jun 28 20:50:19 2015 UTC,"We're just not good talkers.   It's good that you can recognize what you need to work on now.  Patience is pretty important.  I find myself using the phrase ""This won't come out correctly so please be patient with me as I try to get to what I'm really feeling"" or some variation of that.   If I had to do it over again, here's some thoughts as to what I would have like to define earlier:  Sex/Intimacy - Because you're so introverted and this sex is such a personal thing, you should have a clear understanding that sex is all about communication and that you both need to be totally open and honest with each other about it.  A healthy sexual relationship is going to be based on open dialogue.  You both need to feel that when the other brings up a concern, you won't be judged or mocked or immediately shut down.    Kids/Discipline - I'm not sure if you either of you has kids currently from your post, but if you don't, I would encourage you not to make too many hard/fast rules about parenting right now.  We have 4 girls and they respond differently to varying incentives and punishments.  Some are more logical than others while others are just emotional creatures.  The rules of your home should be universal in your family but the teaching/application of discipline may be tailored to each child.  Agree to maintain constant dialogue and evaluation of how you're parenting and what the results are.  (Pro-Tip - Daddy/Daughter or Father/Son activities are a big help in this regard).  General tips:  Take notes on some of these conversations where appropriate.  You may not be able to remember everything so it's not a bad idea to jot down the points that are important.  Listen. Listen. Listen.  Don't just start formulating your next thought while she's talking.    Have a plan, but be flexible when the universe erases your plan and resets you back to zero.    Establish new family traditions.  You may have traditions on both sides of your family, but start new ones right away.  Not just big holidays, but maybe Sunday dinners or FHE rotations, etc."
lds,3bap4d,jgardner,2,Sun Jun 28 01:32:12 2015 UTC,"Lots of really helpful stuff here.  Sex is a tough one.  It might help that we're older, but we're probably going to have to fumble through that a little.  Maybe if we see a marriage counselor we can get some assistance.  I don't see us having a ton of pre-marriage communication about that on our own.  Kids is a huge priority for us.  I don't have good role-models that I can draw on in my own parents.  She does.  She talks about the different personalities of her 6 siblings.  She's very emotional and sensitive.  I'm logical, but still sensitive.  My hope is that we will both contribute ideas and be a great team.  I'm not really a note taker, and I don't think she is either.  I prefer to fully focus on the moment I'm in.  My scriptures don't have any marks in them.  It works well for me, though.   Listen. Listen. Listen. Don't just start formulating your next thought while she's talking.   I've been thinking a lot about this one lately.  It's a huge weakness for me.  I'm always thinking about what I just said, or what I want to say next.  I'm trying to change.  Thanks again."
lds,3bap4d,ddzado,2,Sun Jun 28 03:09:40 2015 UTC,"Our discussions were mostly doctrinal. We talked about her thoughts on contraception, polygamy, Priesthood, and family structure as these things are defined in the Church's doctrine. We talked about how to handle conflicts and that divorce is almost never a reasonable conclusion. We talked about each others' long-term expectations and building a gospel-centered home full of children. As we both agreed on these issues and both wanted to be with each other for indefinite time, we got married less than 3 months after we met. We've been married for 8.5 years now and it's been awesome."
lds,3b8bbn,jessemb,7,Fri Jun 26 19:54:24 2015 UTC,"It's already legal in some parts of the world, and tolerated in others. The adverse legal conditions we were experiencing when polygamy was ended in 1890 and 1904 are no longer a problem.  Now, it comes down to two things:   Will God command it? Will members accept it?   If it does return, it's going to be very divisive. I would not be at all surprised to see a bulk of the currently active members leave the church over the reinstatement of polygamy."
lds,3b8bbn,amertune,2,Fri Jun 26 21:09:51 2015 UTC,"If it happened tomorrow, or at the October conference, I'd agree completely.  But a lot can change over, say, ten years.  If the Lord wanted to bring it back, he'd make steps to prepare his people.  I'm not worried that it's coming back soon, not seriously.  Not until the Brethren start talking about it.  If it comes, I don't think it will come as a surprise to the people who are paying attention.  And the people who are not paying attention to the Brethren have already taken themselves halfway out of the Church."
lds,3b8bbn,smacktaix,5,Fri Jun 26 21:18:47 2015 UTC,"IMO, there is no way that it will come back overnight. When polygamy was revoked in 1890, it took an extra 15 years to really get serious about enforcement. It wasn't until the first generation of Church members had all but died out that the Word of Wisdom was seriously enforced. If there's one thing you can say about the Church, it's that they do things with a great amount of patience and foresight, I dare say even prophetic foresight.  There is still a fair amount of time on the clock. The Church will start moving this way. Hints will be dropped. Curriculum will be recirculated. People will be given the opportunity to warm up to the idea. This has already been happening in the Church in individual ways.  To clarify, this is my conviction, but it is not absolute. It is possible that the Church will ""spring it"" on us (as much as you can spring a 175 year old doctrine on someone). If they do that, I will not question their judgement; it would certainly be a rapid way to separate wheat from tares."
lds,3b8bbn,allbeefpatties,2,Fri Jun 26 21:28:41 2015 UTC,"So if it does come back, is that an optional thing? I understand (admittedly limited understanding) that it was not for all members when it was practiced previously.  I wonder about the 'logistics' of how that would go into place.    On a personal level, I'm not sure I'm built to handle the emotional load of caring for two women plus all the children."

No one had to be a polygamist in the same way you have to be baptized. But everyone had to be ready to be willing to be a polygamist because if the command came, that was God's will."
lds,3b8bbn,Curlaub,3,Sun Jun 28 03:57:59 2015 UTC,"Regardless of whether or not it will be legalized, Im pretty certain the church will never allow it.

The whole ""raising up seed unto the lord"" thing I take to mean building up the population of the church. We clearly dont need any help doing that."

I specifically have avoided speculating on whether it will return to the church in mortality.  I don't really even think that's a good question to ask.  A better question is, will I be asked or required (there's a difference) to live it ever?  I also don't answer that one, even privately.  I'm willing to live it, and that's enough for now."

I'm not of the opinion that the person I marry has to be perfect.  If she struggles with it, that's not a reason not to get married.  I think the concept that there's a worse end of the deal is wrong.  I suspect that the principle is meant to get us all to an understanding of what celestial glory is all about.  I think the only reason we think that there's any bad part of the deal at all is because we lack that understanding.  It's not easy for me, either.  I don't fully understand the principle.  I just have a willingness to obey and a desire to learn."

lds,3b8bbn,overly_sarcastic24,0,Sat Jun 27 06:43:31 2015 UTC,"That's pretty much how I feel.  Mainly, I tell myself not to get too surprised to find that more women have qualified for entry into the celestial kingdom than men, that we don't all have the same heavenly mother, and that God wants me to marry some more women so they all have the same eternal rewards.  It's a difficult thing, and I'd love it if things end up conforming to a more 20th century U.S. cultural norm, but I'm willing to change."

If he has a need for his people to ""raise up seed"" then he may call for the reinstatement of polygamy. The question you should be asking ourself then is, ""does God have a need to raise up more seed?"" In the early days of the church there was a need. Today there really is no need, and I don't see a need arising anytime soon."

lds,3b8bbn,Statecensor,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:47:45 2015 UTC,"Polygamy was a very challenging issue for the early church until ~ 1907 when it ended for the mainstream members.  The church has spent so much time distancing themselves from the idea I don't think they would readily return, and I don't think the majority of members would except it.  They are very aware of general public opinion and the opinion as whole is very against polygamy, especially as was practice of marrying very young women to much older men much of the time.  It would crush all the public opinion gains the church has made from the turn of the century.  The church does not allow polygamy in African countries where it is legal and I don't see them advocating for it in America."

You need deep pockets for that and most polygamists do not have that type of money laying around to throw away on decade long legal battles to reach the supreme court.  As for this What would we need to do to prepare for the possibility of being commanded to live the law of plural marriage again? it will not happen. It would require the leadership of the church to step up and admit their ancestors bent to the will of an outside force and sold out their own beliefs for political power in Utah.   Remember polygamy was slowly banned over time and many well connected men still had multiple wives. While those without connections and insisted on keeping the principal alive publicly got disfellowshipped and exiled. In some cases by men who themselves had more then one wife. Do any of the current leaders look like people who admit their ancestors made such mistakes? Right now we have tens of thousands of families who still follow the principle living in exile all over the United States and in Mexico they would have be accepted as victims wronged by church officials.

Woodruff admits that new plural marriages were stopped because he saw the political, social, and legal fallout and the Lord told him it wasn't what He wanted for the Church at that time.

This was edited in which is why I didn't mention it in my first reply. You're right that this would change the dynamic between mainstream LDS and ""fundamentalists"", but it definitely is not a matter of victimization. The churches have branched and are wholly separate now. They rejected the prophets. It's clear that God has authority to install or remove the practice of polygamy at His pleasure. A tradition of denying that is not victimization, it's apostasy.  I hope we can bridge the gap and be kinder to polygamist breakoffs, but the Church reinstating the doctrine would not be an admission of anything that the breakoffs claim, nor would it be an admission that we mistreated the polygamist apostates."

lds,3aoqbk,ldsthrow10c3,3,Mon Jun 22 06:56:51 2015 UTC,"Former bishopric member here, though I don't know that my advice is particularly useful...  I think that it's clear there are lots of maybe's in this situation and not many probably's.   I have no answer for how the counselor gave this blessing, but I think it's worth noting that expecting every priesthood holder to give 100% accurate, prophetic, and fulfilled blessings every time is a mistake. If you are a Melchizedek priesthood holder, I'm sure you can think of times when you gave a blessing and found yourself feeling uncertain, or not as spiritually connected as you would like. Ideally we should excuse ourselves when that happens, but in reality, nobody does.  So, yes, the counselor is one possible weak link in this chain of promises. Frankly, this seems the MOST likely solution to your problem.  Even faithful, worthy saints can struggle to give an efficacious blessing. Historian Truman Madsen describes how the prophet ordered a group of men to heal somebody, and they had to give the blessings four times before it finally ""took.""   A single blessing, without the faith of both parties and the ratifying power of the Holy Ghost, is no guarantee of results.   Having said that, there ARE times when blessings are full of the power of God. For example, when I got my patriarchal blessing, the patriarch asked me to spend some time preparing as well as fasting before the blessing. It remains one of the most powerful experiences of my life.  However, had I, or the patriarch, not prepared sufficiently, I doubt things would have turned out as well. I have also been the beneficiary of healing blessings, and given a few as well, which have come to fruition.   Sometimes, such as in your situation, we just don't know how, when, or what parts of a blessing will be fulfilled. If, however, you had felt the confirming witness of the Holy Ghost that that particular part of your blessing was true, then hold fast to that. It will still be true. And, sad as it may be, it might just mean next time you're serving in a presidency. Or you may never get a chance to see just how this promise was fulfilled in this life.   If you feel strongly there was some good to do that you didn't get to do, then, yes! speak to your bishop. He'll want to know. He'll be able to tell you why you were released. He'll help you figure out the next steps.   Anyway, I'm rambling now. Good luck."
lds,3aoqbk,onewatt,6,Mon Jun 22 19:44:32 2015 UTC,"A blessing is potential, not a guarantee.   This leaves the unkindly option that the member of the bishopric that set me apart was not really giving inspired blessing.   That is one option.  Here's another.   Your Sunday School's president made a choice not to involve you in presidency meetings. Or you did  (""I was less involved than I wanted to be"" - yikes!) - that isn't clear to me. I'm comfortable saying that agency limited opportunity to offer advice."
lds,3aoqbk,professsorspaceman,-1,Mon Jun 22 07:39:49 2015 UTC,"Or you did (""I was less involved than I wanted to be"" - yikes!) - that isn't clear to me.   My reading is that he tried to a reasonable degree within the constraints of his situation, and it sounds like the bishopric was aware of the scheduling difficulty before the call was placed, so if they didn't want to be at least partially accommodating to the schedule, they probably shouldn't have called him.   A blessing is potential, not a guarantee.   I'm not so sure about that. Definitely there are ways around most blessings if one is actively trying to circumvent (e.g., intentionally contradicting to disprove the officiator), but that doesn't sound like the case here.  What value is a blessing if we just hand-wave it away when it doesn't work out? If the Civil War had started in Georgia instead of South Carolina, would we look at D&C 87:1 and just say ""it's OK, agency got in the way, this false prediction doesn't mean anything""?  The OP is correct in stating that blessings are not worth much if you can just say ""Well, someone changed what they were supposed to do, so it didn't happen!"" Any predictive element of blessings is actually completely worthless if that is the approach. Are you sure you want to jump on that boat so quickly?"
lds,3aoqbk,smacktaix,2,Mon Jun 22 08:09:35 2015 UTC,"I agree with Smack on this one:  A blessing is most definitely a guarantee .  However, a guarantee that we must strive toward. If I am blessed that I will have great health, it is still on me to do everything that I possibly can in order to fulfill that blessing. Blessings are not a one way street.   D&C 130 clarifies this lack of one way street:  20 There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated—  21 And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.  When reading the entire post, I feel bad for the brother and I think the whole release should have been handled a lot better, but there is much to be known about this situation and I have faith that the bishop is in possession of that knowledge."
lds,3aoqbk,damonlds,3,Mon Jun 22 16:32:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think those two uses of the word ""blessing"" are synonymous.   I have been counseled to include instruction in blessings, when led by the spirit, and this may have been what was meant, rather than a prophecy. It makes more sense to believe the counselor was trying to say, ""this is your responsibility, and capability, to provide good advice"" rather than ""I prophesy that you will give good advice.""   It may be much like Zion's Camp, who were given a commandment to do one thing, misunderstood their calling and failed in their original understanding of the commandment, but those with honest intentions were blessed and then realized the intent of the blessing may have been different than something they originally understood."
lds,3aoqbk,jac01016,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:36:15 2015 UTC,"It is clearly impossible for any of us to actually know (except the OP) exactly the wording of the blessing.   But I would reason that both a prophecy and a blessing, while not entirely the same thing, are both subject to the person receiving the prophecy or blessing Either way it is a two way street.  We are perfectly capable of not fulfilling our end of the bargain.  As the Lord says in D&C 58:  28 For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward.  I would never suggest such a thing is the path of the OP, and it is likely that there are multiple other factors on both sides of his story. I just wanted to point out in response to your response that Heavenly Father has set parameters under which either a blessing or Prophecy can be revoked.   And as you suggested there is always a high probability that the blessing was not completely understood."
lds,3aoqbk,damonlds,-1,Tue Jun 23 00:07:34 2015 UTC,I'm not so sure about that.    Was D&C 87 a setting apart blessing?  I'm not familiar with its historical context.
lds,3aoqbk,professsorspaceman,-2,Mon Jun 22 17:20:44 2015 UTC,"I don't think so, but does that matter? Both contain predictions supposedly conveyed by the Holy Ghost upon an authorized administrator. That's the part that seems relevant to me. The issue would be that Joseph Smith was faithful to his administration and spoke as moved upon (as proved by the fact that South Carolina was the birthplace of the Civil War as predicted), and the person performing the ordinance in this case may or may not have.  I see little difference except that there's even more reason to have accurate predictions in the ordinance of setting apart, which is meant to provide a direct, personal blessing pertinent to the activities expected to be carried out."
lds,3aoqbk,smacktaix,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:30:50 2015 UTC,"I'll stick to my original answer.  I'm unwilling to telegraphically judge the worthiness of OP's bishopric here, I guess."
lds,3aoqbk,professsorspaceman,-2,Mon Jun 22 18:43:13 2015 UTC,"OK, but you are more willing to judge the worthiness of OP himself and/or his Sunday School President, since you said one of them is probably to blame for the failure of the words that the bishopric member pronounced. I guess that's better?  It sounds like OP was hoping there was a viable explanation besides someone's failure to do right. Would you agree that it doesn't sound like there is? You believe it is more likely that it would be the fault of the non-bishopric member than a bishopric member, but you acknowledge a failure to follow the law is the likely cause of the failure of the promises made to OP (either in the part of the bishopric member by saying things that weren't real, or the people involved in the calling for not trying hard enough)?  IMO it seems more plausible that a bishopric member would just get into routine and start saying things that are similar to what he usually says without seriously entreating the Lord for guidance or treating his responsibility with the gravity due. I think that's a problem if that's what we're dealing with. I don't know how OP should go about resolving it, but I know it's always sorely disappointing when things like this hurt vulnerable members. OP sounds earnest to me."
lds,3aoqbk,smacktaix,2,Mon Jun 22 19:08:27 2015 UTC,"Since I'm new to this sub, I'll explain here that I post late because I'm not on the internet every day.  Although there are possible explanations involving the bishopric member not preparing for the blessing correctly, or the sunday school presidency not allowing for fulfillment of the promises in the blessing, I don't like that train of thought at all.  Are you going to call your church leaders to repentance?  In my life, when something hasn't gone the way I feel God has promised, introspection has been the answer 100% of the time.  I'm not even interested in hearing more about your situation, because what I think doesn't matter, but here are some ""Lord, is it I?"" questions you might ask yourself (I'd gently suggest these questions would have been appropriate at the time of your calling):  Am I really doing all I can to connect with my presidency?  What more can I do?  Does my heavenly Father want me to look for a job/career that more adequately allows me to do His work?  I know my will, but what is His?  What are the barriers in my life that are standing in the way of my contributions to the building up of Zion?  In my 20's, I had a calling in the young men's organization in the church.  I didn't do a good job for a number of reasons.  My job required travel throughout the week, extending to late friday night.  This resulted in an almost total exclusion from any ym activities.  I had my tongue pierced and it was noticed by some of the boys.  I only had the calling for a few months and was released without being informed (I went to church every Sunday).  My home teaching companion was actually offended that they handled it that way, but I knew in my heart that I wasn't serving those young men.  Later in life, I decided to take out my tongue-piercing in very large part to remembering that experience and having a desire to not let anything stand in my way of my discipleship.  The calling was an eventual blessing to me, 13 years later, even though it was probably not helpful to anyone else."
lds,3aoqbk,papatank,0,Fri Jun 26 09:41:09 2015 UTC,"I think OP was probably destined to be disappointed with this post. It's a highly personal situation and no internet stranger has the right information to help judge. He asked about going to his bishop and discussing it. What do we think about that? I think it's a medium-bad idea.  My opinion is that it unfortunately is just something OP will have to sit on for a while. If he is faithful, he will either accept the counselor's failure and come to peace with it, or learn that the blessing didn't really fail. I think the first one is more likely. We are all human in the Church and all in all a bishop's counselor isn't that big of a deal, they can still make some silly and immature mistakes. I just hope OP has enough good blessing experiences to fall back on that it doesn't jeopardize his testimony of the principle in general."
lds,3amehu,smacktaix,-4,Sun Jun 21 17:30:30 2015 UTC,"What did the Savior mean when He said that “the sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath”? I believe He wanted us to understand that the Sabbath was His gift to us, granting real respite from the rigors of daily life and an opportunity for spiritual and physical renewal. God gave us this special day, not for amusement or daily labor but for a rest from duty, with physical and spiritual relief."
lds,3amehu,Easilyremembered,5,Sun Jun 21 17:31:24 2015 UTC,"I understand the spiritual aspect of the relief he is describing. I have often found myself at odds, however, with other members and sometimes even leaders regarding the physical aspect of the relief he is describing.  I sit at a desk for 40+ hours a week, I work another working 10-20 hours cooped up at home. The last thing that I need is more time sitting down or staying in the house. I find that a rigorous outside activity with friends and family tends to reinvigorate my spirit. But when I carry those activities out, a trip up the canyon for rock climbing after church, a tennis match followed by a family bbq, working in the yard in the late afternoon, etc. I take a lot of flack from other members. As I mentioned I've even had more than one leader approach me about it.   I wonder if the physical aspect of the relief he is describing is taken by members to mean that we shouldn't engage in any physically demanding or strenuous activity. Such a perspective would have been understandable in times past, when most weekly labor was manual and physically strenuous."

There are exmormon contributors who have become adept at concern-trolling and skirting the edges of the moderation policy (and apparently don't have jobs or whatever), which drives off faithful members who are tired of being heckled. Culturally, the kind of Mormons who look for truth by arguing with strangers on the internet just tend to skew that way. There are a lot of questions in that sub for which the simple answer is obvious and doesn't demand a lot of discussion -- so the people who show up to write walls of text are either NOMs with a ""sophisticated perspective"" on the ""difficult issues"", or dummies like me who keep taking the bait.

lds,171lua,Mountainmantom,14,Tue Jan 22 07:20:54 2013 UTC,"My husband served in Milan from 2004 - 2006. (He loved it). Congratulations on being called to the BEST mission in the world.   From all the stories I've heard him tell over the years, here are some things I  bet he would tell you:    Italians are extremely warm, friendly, and hospitable people all over Italy. In the North, they tend to be wealthier, more fashion/status-conscious and ""worldly."" The richer the area, the harder time he had finding people to teach, (my husband attributes this to the general worldliness of the Milanese culture, along with a community steeped in ""cultural Catholicism"", Aka : those who consider themselves catholic, but in reality are either agnostic, atheist, apathetic, or just non-practicing).    A lot of people will assume you are Jehovah's Witnesses. There is not much you can do about this except tell them over and over again that you are not Jehovah's Witnesses. Some people will still not believe you. If you don't already love tomatoes -- you will learn to love them. No, but really.  The food is superb and people will love cooking for you. When you go to dinner appointments with members, expect to be kept waiting. They will tell you to come at 7 and when you arrive, they will just be starting dinner. They will chat with you, maybe have appetizers, tell you about their recipes, talk to you about the illustrious history of the Italian people, etc. You will finally sit down to dinner at 8, and they will try and keep you all night if you let them.  When my husband served in Milan, the mission president allowed them to have up to 2 hours at a dinner appointment (which is way longer than would be typical in other missions).  Prepare to be inundated with carb-o-licious pasta at every meal. Expect to put on at least 15 pounds. If you can, learn recipes from the members. (My husband still refers to his hand-written recipe notebook, which is a bit of a souvenir, because he has pictures, food labels, and hand-written recipes from some of his favorite members and companions). Also, make sure you try some of the stranger (but still tasty) delicacies you are offered, whether it's pig's feet, bull penis, or some weird fruit cake.  Try to do communal meals with your companions (or quad) as often as possible. In the first six months of the mission, my husband's companions all tried treating each other like college roommates in terms of being possessive about food, fighting over who will do the dishes, etc. Finally, he got a group of four missionaries who loved to cook for each other and pool their money for dinners 4 or 5 nights a week. He said this was some of the most rewarding experiences he had with his fellow missionaries -- cooking, shopping, and doing household chores together.  He still speaks fondly about the time they pooled all their spare money for a couple of weeks and saved up for a 40 euro wheel of parmaggiano regganio. He lasted them for months.  This could go for any foreign mission -- but don't be afraid of making mistakes with the language. Speak up whenever you can, and force yourself to learn the language by trial and error. Italians will be very forgiving of your mistakes, and very happy to see you trying to learn their beautiful language (of which they are so proud).  My husband and more success with door knocking (doing ""casa"" -- houses - as they call it), than he did with approaching people on the street. If you are doing street contacting,, Buses and public transportation are a great place for casual conversations, cause they will tolerate speaking with you instead of instinctively avoiding you.  Asking people about food is the never-fail conversation starter. ""I'm an American and I love the food here! What is the BEST recipe for the perfect tomato sauce?""  Everyone will happily start talking to you about it, then you just have to find some way to segue.     Best of luck! You will love it!"

Eat lots of gelato. Get your studying passed off ASAP so that you can earn privileges to go see the sights on your P-Day. Florence was not in the Rome mission when I was there - I think it was in the Milan Misison. If Florence is in your mission, go see Michelangelo's David.

Frankly, I don't worry about it anymore.  Not that I seek out suits with plunging necklines, but I just don't stress about it.  [Slightly unrelated; a friend once told me while we we trying on clothes that a sweater looked immodest on me.  A long sleeve, turtle necked, sweater.  It wasn't even tight.  There is only so much I can do.  My body is just my body and shouldn't be viewed as inherently sexual for just existing.]  I don't think there is anything wrong with going the tankini route either.  Especially since its pretty easy to find tankinis that don't actually show midriff.  Do what makes you most comfortable."

This is not consistent with the law. We shouldn't encourage women to ""wear whatever [they want]"". The OP is awesome in that she is conscientiously attempting to follow the commandments, which include modest dress.  My advice would be to do your reasonable best, and if cleavage still exists, it'll be OK. Some breasts are unreasonably difficult to fully cover all the time. Do what you can to prevent uncouth amounts of cleavage, but otherwise don't sweat it too much."
lds,171qaz,jessemb,9,Tue Jan 22 21:26:20 2013 UTC,"And, see, the reason I'd say that would be that it's impossible to talk about cleavage without sounding like a creeper.  I agree with your position, but I think we can delegate this responsibility to the women of the Church.  :)"
lds,171qaz,caligari87,3,Tue Jan 22 22:23:02 2013 UTC,"I personally feel that as long as you aren't deliberately choosing a bathing suit to show off your assets or draw attention to your body, then just pick whatever is comfortable and you'll be fine. Some girls have large breasts, no sense trying to overcompensate for something you can't control.   Of course, if you personally just aren't comfortable with showing cleavage, then try and find a high-neckline one-piece somewhere, like this one. I know I've seen those around."
lds,171qaz,SethEllis,4,Tue Jan 22 13:57:58 2013 UTC,"My wife has discovered the ultimate solution to all your female bathing suit woes.  Get a Speedo.  The kind that Olympic swimmers wear.  You can find them at stores that cater to competitive swimmers, sports stores, and online.  They make suits and cuts for all sizes (my wife has an H cup for those unbelievers out there).  They're perfectly modest as well, but that's besides the point.  They are simply the best bathing suit you can get.  Good support, padding, and durable material.  Or so she says.  She likes it, she looks great, and we go to the pool three times a week now.  Well worth the $70."
lds,171qaz,wanderlust712,7,Tue Jan 22 18:01:35 2013 UTC,"Bathing suits are bathing suits and they fit everyone differently. Showing cleavage in a swimsuit isn't a crime. A lot of the time, it's just how they fit and you can't help being well-endowed.   I think it would be silly to wear a t-shirt over your suit. Just wear what you feel looks good and is comfortable to swim in (and modest.) Swimsuits are swimsuits.   Have you tried wearing a suit with built-in underwire? I think that can offer more support and coverage than a traditional soft-cup bathing suit."
lds,171qaz,kayejazz,8,Tue Jan 22 14:32:06 2013 UTC,"Hi, mormongirl. Woman with similar problems here.  I've always had a one piece, myself. As I've been a mom and nursed babies, my body shape has changed and expanded in certain areas, making swimsuits tough. The feeling of falling out on top is one of the worst ever and makes swimming really uncomfortable sometimes.  I've decided that there are a couple of things that will be helpful next time I buy one. The tankini seems to be the best option for me because my top size and my bottom size are drastically different. (I have this problem with shirts, too. My waist size is medium, but my chest size is large.) The other thing I have decided is that going to a store like wal-mart or target is probably not going to cut it for my needs. They cater to the average sizes without the difficulties we face. Make sure you take the time to try things on and move around in what you try on. You don't want to just pick something off the rack and hope it works.  Good luck. If you find something you like, let me know. I'm in the market too."

lds,171qaz,benbernards,5,Wed Jan 23 00:54:15 2013 UTC,"Guy here, so take it for what it's worth. It's not up for me to decide how anyone dresses, especially women, but I'll offer my perspective.  As I see it, modesty is more about why you are dressing a certain way, rather than how you are dressing or what is showing or not.   I've seen people that are not showing any skin but still exude a sense of sexiness, sensuality, and a subliminal desire to draw attention to their physical appeal. I would deem that as being 'immodest'.  I've also seen people that happen to be showing a bit of a taboo area, but it was unintentional or a natural product of how their body was shaped, etc., and it was clear to me that they weren't actively trying to draw attention to themselves. To me, that's modest.   I don't think showing cleavage is automatically immodest, and neither do I think that not showing it is automatically modest.  It's not about the bathing suit...it's about the person in the bathing suit."
lds,171qaz,fbs2,2,Wed Jan 23 01:15:04 2013 UTC,"I love to swim and when I started having children my rack got a little bigger, but I don't let it get in the way of enjoying swimming. I look for bathing suits that won't fold down when I dive. This unfortunately happened to me once and I swore it would never happen again. The suit  has to fit snug up top and if it shows a little cleavage so be it, but no one will get a peep show under or out of the water."

This was a study out of Princeton being discussed.    So again do what you want, but if you decide to wear something revealing don't kid yourselves that many men are viewing you anything other then an objective means to an end. Not as a human they are bonding with.  In fact, men in the study preferred the women in bikinis if their faces were cropped out."

And just so people know, I am not judging you or think less of you if you wear something revealing.  I just want people to be aware of how common men (common enough that the findings made strong statements) often objectify women who wear things like bikinis. If the friendly warning is unhelpful ignore it."
lds,171qaz,benbernards,3,Tue Jan 22 16:38:08 2013 UTC,"Fair enough.   There is a difference between choosing what to wear out of concern how others might see you vs. choosing what to wear out of concern how you view yourself.

It does matter because you make it sound as though men are all a bunch of barbarians who see a bit of cleavage and suddenly want to have sex, which isn't true at all."
lds,171qaz,josephsmidt,-5,Tue Jan 22 18:59:56 2013 UTC,"Hey, if you don't like what is in the peer reviewed literature that is our own prerogative.   Liberal_Mormon    This is why I laugh when I am told liberals side with science and conservatives don't.  The truth is both sides reject studies when it doesn't say what they want to hear and this comment is no different.  Saying a real study makes men sound like barbarians is no more an argument is it wrong then saying evolution sounds like dogs giving birth to cats.  Both misunderstand the study and use the misunderstanding to ignore the peer reviewed literature to maintain their worldview.  But again this was only a warning of what has been published in an academic journal.  If people want to ignore it through justification or attacking a strawman (the study never stated men are barbarians just described how the male brain works with certain images... the perfect strawman) to defend what one wants to believe fine."

lds,16zok9,kayejazz,6,Mon Jan 21 15:15:29 2013 UTC,"I often look at the general authorities and how they talk. It seems like at least half of what they say is scripture. I know that in conference, they have the teleprompter, but in the occasions I have seen a GA in real life, they still speak the same way.  It takes a lifetime to be like that, I think. Imagine how many hours and years of study has shaped their thoughts and intents. but, the big thing is that knowing the words is not nearly as important as knowing what comes with them.  Do you know what the principles of the gospel are? Do you follow the teachings and try to implement them in your life? Do you feel the spirit and act on promptings? Those things are much more important than being able to quote a scripture in class.  The language of the scriptures can be difficult. Try using the study aids from lds.org. Seminary and institute manuals can be really helpful. And remember. Reading the scriptures is often about being obedient to counsel and blessings come when we are obedient.  I found an article on lds.org that might be helpful. It's talking mostly about the Church's Handbook of instruction, but can easily be applied to scriptures. You can read it here.  And remember that meaning and understanding changes over time and according to our needs. Just don't give up!"
lds,16zok9,kayejazz,5,Mon Jan 21 15:59:08 2013 UTC,I do know the principals and strive to live them even in the choatic setting I'm in now (Afgahnistan). Thanks for the article!

lds,16zok9,AnimeJ,2,Mon Jan 21 17:08:57 2013 UTC,"Cutting yourself slack is CRUCIAL.  Constantly be looking for better ways to do things, but remember that criticizing yourself wastes energy that could be better used in...say...pondering scriptures that you just studied.  Life is not a contest or competition.  Do everything you can do and try to do better today than you did yesterday.  Nothing more is required."
lds,16zok9,Honeybeard,1 point,Tue Jan 22 13:08:41 2013 UTC,"You are seriously in the perfect place to get to that. If you brought a set of the red book scriptures, keep your book of mormon in a cargo pocket and read whenever you get a few minutes of downtime. Pray often. We'll keep you in our prayers back home."

Imagine how many hours and years of study has shaped their thoughts and intents. but, the big thing is that knowing the words is not nearly as important as knowing what comes with them.   Definitely. Work and reap the rewards. There seems to be a big work ethic within not only LDS but American culture as well, and I have no doubt that the members who do recite so eloquently are the members who do read through fatigue; face their demons; succeed and fail daily in their practice of the Gospel, and more.  You are always going to be saved through faith by grace, and never by knowledge and understanding. Keep a childlike relationship with God. But faith takes effort, practice, and devotion."
lds,16zok9,Thuseld,5,Mon Jan 21 23:15:59 2013 UTC,"Sometimes, the verses being quoted are from the same pool of 1-2 dozen verses that are always quoted. People have them pretty much memorized because they've heard them hundreds of times.  One thing you could do is keep index cards (or even a notebook) nearby when you're reading scriptures. When you come across something that is meaningful to you you could write it down and then make a conscious effort to memorize it."
lds,16zok9,iwasazombie,3,Mon Jan 21 16:24:39 2013 UTC,"You should come be in my ward. People here can barely read a verse out loud without a bunch of mistakes, let alone quote verses from memory.   A couple of questions for you. Do you read the lesson material before hand? And not during Sacrament meeting. Does your scripture study consist of reading a chapter, or saying ""today I am going to study prayer, and look up verses about that?""  I found that I was able to participate in lessons a lot better if I had actually read the scriptures. Then you can pipe up and be like ""oh, oh oh! I read about that this week"", and go back to what you have read.   Similarly, when I started studying by topic, I found it much easier to remember scriptures because I had sought them out, not just read them because they were next. Do I have any memorized? A couple, but not many. And that is because I think any long-time member of the church can probably, if not word for word, recite the gist of James 1:5.  TL:DR, I found that preparing for lessons and studying by topic helped me be better acquainted with scriptures, and seem like I know about them."
lds,16zok9,Honeybeard,5,Mon Jan 21 16:10:47 2013 UTC,"There is a great Spirit that comes from learning and memorizing certain scriptures. I was required to for a religion class, but some of those verses stuck with me, and I find them running through my head during Sunday School often. It took effort, but it was well worth it."
lds,16zok9,yellodello1221,3,Mon Jan 21 16:35:06 2013 UTC,"The only reason why it seems like you are the only person who can't recite scripture is because those who can't aren't vocal about it. Miss Molly Mormon next to you can't either, but she daren't say anything in embarrassment.  For me, the best approach is honesty (apparently it's the best policy as well? Somebody else can clarify). Be upfront about your lack of memory in public, be lighthearted about it and say it with humility and a smile. Disassociating the negative thoughts and stress with it will allow you to not only love yourself better (which I feel is so important and overlooked) but also the ability to spout relevant scripture at the correct time"
lds,16zok9,yellodello1221,3,Mon Jan 21 19:03:06 2013 UTC,"I would have to say that simply reading the Scriptures helps a great deal.  I have felt like you do, spiritually stunted, but then I finally decided it was actually time to read.  So, at 21 years old, I have gotten farther in the Book of Mormon than I ever have before, and I can already sense a difference.  Just do the best you can, little by little, and the Lord can help with the rest."
lds,16zok9,lebruf,1 point,Mon Jan 21 22:02:01 2013 UTC,"Oh hey you wanted some scriptures for support.  The first that came to my mind was Alma 32:27.  The context is faith, but I believe that the concept of desire can be applied anywhere.  A simple desire to become closer with the Scriptures is the best way to start, and you already have that! Way to be!  Let is propel you forward.  You've got this."
lds,16zok9,jgardner,2,Mon Jan 21 22:54:30 2013 UTC,"I haven't diligently studied the scriptures in years... but I still remember the scriptures I had to memorize for Seminary. We used to have 'scripture chase' competitions that really ended up reinforcing the location and the context of the scripture so those ended up sticking with me.  Double that up with the mission (96-98), where I had the six standard discussions that for the most part, used those same scripture chase scriptures and a whole bunch more, my knowledge was reinforced with repetition giving discussions day in and day out. Considering that we had a full hour of Gospel Study every morning, and and no outside reading for those two years aside from the approved gospel library and CES student manuals, I’d say that I ended up reading the BOM at least five times and the Bible twice.   On top of that, I had the required 14 credit hours of Religion classes at BYU, so it all just added up over time. It’s like knowing all the lyrics to your favorite albums you owned in your teens, it just sticks with you with seemingly little effort on your part.   My wife is a convert of ten years, and is much more diligent in her scripture study and Sunday School attendance but still is amazed by my scripture knowledge. I consider it a product of my years from age 14-22, and my competitive nature in my Seminary years."
lds,16zok9,xochitec,1 point,Mon Jan 21 21:47:03 2013 UTC,"Some people have the gift of knowledge, some people have the gift of wisdom, others have the gift of teaching knowledge and wisdom. You will rarely find all three in one person, sometimes you might find one person having two of the three... but most of the time you will have the strength in one of the three. It sounds like you may not have the gift of knowledge. No big deal. While it's good to ""seek after the best gifts"" and ""make weak things become strong"", it's probably more important to look at the strengths you do have (teaching or wisdom) and develop and refine those. That is your contribution. Let those with knowledge do their part and you do your part with your gifts - envying another's gift does little for our personal advancement and contributions."
lds,170htb,mrfilbert,2,Mon Jan 21 21:45:27 2013 UTC,I have discovered through a contact   I would do some personal verification first. I wouldn't confuse your father (or yourself) until you know 100% sure by double checking what happened.    For instance: could there have been more then one person in Germany with the same name and hence you have someone else's birth certificate?  Can you track down more information on this supposed mother to see if things check out?  Etc...  PS.  I descend from Germans myself and there have been a couple lines who passed bad biographical information onto their children.  It's like every other person in Germany in the early 1900s wanted to cover up who they really were. :)
lds,170htb,josephsmidt,1 point,Mon Jan 21 21:49:14 2013 UTC,"Yah, OP, definitely double- or triple-check your sources, if possible. My wife's family is German and we've had to be extra-careful to make sure we had accurate info, as much was modified or lost or incorrectly entered when they immigrated. I also have a friend who learned that decades worth of family history work was all for naught due to a misrepresentation on some birth certificates; he wasn't related to any of the great-great-great grandparents that he thought he was.  As to whether or not you should approach your father with this, I'd say it depends on what your relationship is with your dad, and what you perceive his relationship to be with his birth mother. If you think he'd be positive and open about it, maybe you could test the waters a bit before unveiling everything?"

lds,16ywmm,amertune,6,Mon Jan 21 04:00:39 2013 UTC,"There's definitely something to this. An overly critical attitude can be a real barrier to achieving what you can out of the lesson.   However, I think there are some legitimate issues with many teachers and speakers in the church and whenever it's brought up, people respond with essays like this. Yes, having an open rather than a critical mind is a good thing, but it shouldn't be used to obscure the very real issues that exist with teacher training (or the lack there of) at church.   Edit: In other words, when people say ""Church is boring. What can we do to fix that?"" The response seems to be:  Why are you so critical? You should just read your scriptures during church instead? You just don't have the right attitude.  Just read the hymnbook instead.  If it's boring, it's your fault.   Why can't we admit that there are problems without there being a huge outcry?"
lds,16ywmm,crosseyedclementine,2,Mon Jan 21 04:47:11 2013 UTC,"While I agree that there are major issues with the way the gospel is taught in some classes, you have to understand that being actively engaged in the lesson does not mean tuning out the teacher and teaching yourself.  For myself, when I find a teacher to be particularly dry or uninteresting, I begin researching the lesson. I've got all the manuals on my phone and I just start connecting the dots between scriptures and quotes. Inevitably, I find something I hadnt found before or make some connection that I hadn't seen. That's when I know I've made the most out of a class or other meeting.  I think it's important to recognize ways to interact with the doctrine in these settings in ways that will help you to learn and grow spiritually in that class or meeting."
lds,16ywmm,UPSguy,1 point,Mon Jan 21 13:50:11 2013 UTC,"RE boring, bad talks & lessons,  I've been thinking a lot about this. I've been going to church and asking, ""Why do I love this? Why do I come every week, put in 8 hours including meetings and visits before and afterwards?""  The simple fact is I stopped going to church for myself a long, long time ago. I really don't get much out of the ""church"" part of church. It seems terribly repetitive and boring, and I don't really see much point to it. (For the same reason, I lost an interest in ""deep"" doctrine. It doesn't matter and I don't care. How many angels can dance on the head of a needle? Give me a good sermon on baptism, instead.)  When I go to church, I am going to see other people, see them progress in the gospel, see them experience the same exhilarating joy I get when I ""lose myself"" in serving others. I want to bring people to church, and have them bring their own people to church, and grow and progress in that way. That's the only thing I care about. Lessons, talks, testimonies, prayers, are all things connected to that primary goal. They are not the goal. If we botch a lesson, but save a soul, do we think about the botched lesson or rejoice in the saved soul?  I think the Savior, if he came to our church meeting, wouldn't care at all how well any of us did at our respective roles. He could write entire books about what we all did wrong and what we could do better but he doesn't do that even when we ask him to. He is interested, instead, in seeing people move forward and progress and get a little bit better every day. His gospel is a simple one, a gospel designed for idiots like us. The church is so true that we're moving forward according to the Savior's plan despite the fact we do so horribly at our respective callings."
lds,16ywmm,jgardner,3,Tue Jan 22 17:02:44 2013 UTC,"Is it ironic that I couldn't get past the incorrect use of ""their?""  Also, I had a similar moment a few months ago. I was at an event and got the very strong impression that my cynicism was preventing me from feeling the spirit as strongly as can be, or getting everything out of my church membership that I could get. It was a bit of a wake-up call."
lds,16ywmm,Thuseld,2,Mon Jan 21 09:51:05 2013 UTC,"Kind of related to the somewhat recent ""why is church boring"" post, but different.

lds,16ywmm,Thuseld,6,Mon Jan 21 04:03:12 2013 UTC,"And I realized that yes, crappy teaching happens all the time in the church, but that doesn’t warrant hubris, pride, or silent accusation towards others.   I teach professionally - I can tell immediately when my students haven't done their homework. Its very frustrating in the literal sense of the word - its hard to get things done. I always come ready with an 'a' lesson in case they're ready and a 'b' lesson for when I come to grips with the fact that they're not.  I do the same thing when I teach in church. I realized a long time ago it was too much to expect that folks in the class had read the lesson.  I blame 90% of the boring-ness we endure as members on a lack of thoughtful preparation on the part of teachers and class members. I think that's why I like /r/lds so much - everyone here knows so much - its intimidating some times; but I don't often encounter that in priesthood/sunday school and I don't know enough about football to make up the difference."

But another core doctrine is not waiting. You start working on it here and now. The doctrine is just that if you fall short after everything you can do, that's still not the end. But we don't just look at problems and say ""That will be fixed later."" just like we don't look at missionary work and say ""They'll get it in Spirit Prison, so I don't need to say anything now.""   If one spouse has a job and the other stays home, they are both blessed.   But the difference is they get to decide who does which between the two of them. And doing the job you want is a reward itself, not just the money. So is being able to exercise the priesthood.

But to answer your question, Jesus chose 12 men to be his companions and witnesses. But there were plenty of women he spent his time with and even Mary Magdalene was an important witness of the things he did and who he was. Nor did Jesus ever teach that women should obey men in all things, as far as I remember, correct me if I'm wrong.

I disagree with all of those statements.  Men hold the Priesthood because they are the ones who need to hold it.  I don't think it has anything to do with whether women are capable of leadership or not--it has something to do with the innate, eternal qualities of gender.  The Priesthood is irrevocably linked with our eternal gender, and I don't think anything will ever change that."

That's what agency is all about.   I disagree with all of those statements. Men hold the Priesthood because they are the ones who need to hold it.    Why? And why don't women?

I'm not saying Yin and Yang is doctrinal, but it's always helped me to express my own limited understanding.  Strangely, we think of men and the Priesthood as very active things--but I think that's backwards.  The description of the Priesthood in D&C 121 is a very passive power.  It's not command, it's persuasion.  We don't use the Priesthood to enforce our will--we use it to bring the will of God to others."

It's the only really important question I can think of that we're not given an answer for.   But male and female are complementary halves of the same whole--neither man nor woman can be complete without the other.   The idea of complementary roles isn't a bad one, but why along gender lines? That's the part I don't understand. I've met women that I've had more in common with than men. Honestly, there's some areas I am just rubbish at being ""masculine"" in and some areas my fiancee just completely beats me, such as in leadership and determination. I don't understand what it is about the priesthood that attaches to our reproductive roles.   I think the Chinese concept of Yin and Yang is an approximation of how I feel that male and female are related.   It's funny you bring up yin and yang. They often represented the aggressive male yin and the passive female yang. But when it comes to my fiancee, we're the exact reverse of that. I'm very passive, very patient, very adaptive. She's much more driven, more more aggressive and determined, more energetic. It's one of the things that really makes me question these intrinsic things. We complement each other, but we don't fit the model for what people expect. So why not the priesthood to her, not me?   It's not command, it's persuasion.    But it's also leadership. We don't use it to enforce our will, but we do use it to accomplish things. It's certainly a power. It feels weird to have a power on only one side of the equation like that."

lds,16y93x,crosseyedclementine,5,Mon Jan 21 06:06:00 2013 UTC,"Does it feel weird that you can never have a baby?   No, because I understand the reasoning behind that and I still have an equal role in the creation and parenting process. I'll admit I'm curious about what it would be like, but I understand why it is the way it is. It's not just""that's the way it is"", there's a reason for it and I know what it is.  But the priesthood is tied up with opportunities and leadership. If I didn't take part in the decisions on how my kid was raised that would definitely make me wonder why just because my wife can have the kid, why does she have more of a role in the thing we're both involved in. It's not just that we are different, that's obvious. I don't understand why one of us gets to do more stuff than the other...

The men of the Church aren't the ones leading it.  It's the Lord.  The Lord is the head of the Church, and the power by which it operates, and the knowledge which operates it.  He can call whomever He likes to whatever position He pleases.  Why should it bother you that men are called to different roles than women?  We aren't running a feudal system.  You don't get extra spiritual brownie points for being a Bishop instead of a nursery leader.  Remember the parable of the talents.  It doesn't matter how much the Lord gives us, it matters what we do with it."
lds,16y93x,7Pedazos,5,Mon Jan 21 06:38:17 2013 UTC,"The problem is that priesthood isn't complimentary to motherhood. Fatherhood is complimentary to motherhood and there is no spiritual equivalent for women.   There are other reasons why this analogy doesn't.. Not every woman can become a mother. Heck, you can become a mother on accident. Every worthy man can have the priesthood and ordination is purposeful. Motherhood has nothing to do with worthiness. Motherhood doesn't require religion remotely while priesthood is a function of religion.   And the argument that Priesthood is connected with gender doesn't really stand as well. In the Old Testament, only one of the 12 tribes of Israel was called to the priesthood, while the other 11 weren't. Deborah was considered a Judge in Israel and Miriam was called a prophetess, both of which require the Priesthood, traditionally. In the early days of the church, women were called to heal the sick, just as priesthood holders are now. Even today, women have the authority to perform ordinances in the temple.   I just don't think your argument stands."
lds,16y93x,Caelcryos,-1,Mon Jan 21 08:03:41 2013 UTC,"...My argument was that man and woman are innately different.  I used babies as an example.  I think it stands just fine.  :)  The Israelites weren't worthy of the Priesthood.  The Lord wanted to make them a ""nation of priests,"" but they couldn't live up to the responsibility.  They went through frequent periods of apostasy.  Even the Levites were only given the Priesthood of Aaron; the Priesthood of Melchizedek appears to have been very rare among them.  There's no reason to assume that Miriam had the Priesthood, when the Jews in Israel had no Priesthood at all.  Moses had to restore it to them.  And as I understand it, being a Judge was a political position in Deborah's day, not a Priesthood office.  But why stop there?  There's also Anna the prophetess in the book of Luke, who apparently never left the Temple, and special rules apply in the Temple.  I have never said that women will never hold the Priesthood.  In fact, I believe that the opposite is true.  Every worthy woman will someday be ordained a priestess.  But what we know about that promised ordination reinforces the doctrine that man and woman have separate and distinct roles, and that we derive our greatest happiness from excelling in those roles."
lds,16y93x,n311go,9,Mon Jan 21 06:44:12 2013 UTC,"If in the temple - the holiest space on earth - women use the priesthood, is it safe to say that women holding the priesthood may be a higher law that we're not living yet, like the whole 1978 thing?  Other random thought:  the priesthood is the authority to act in God's name.  So men represent God in the bestowal of various blessings, while women represent God in the act of creation.  Although, as Caelcryos pointed out already, men help a little bit in the creation process too...  I like how men holding the priesthood and women bearing children increases our need for each other.  But a male-only priesthood feels wrong."
lds,16y93x,jgardner,0,Mon Jan 21 07:59:07 2013 UTC,That's exactly how I feel. Men and women already need each other to have children. Most of us need the other for intimacy and companionship as well.

lds,16y93x,7Pedazos,5,Mon Jan 21 04:40:27 2013 UTC,"Precisely. You pointed to the fallacious nature of the child-bearing comparison. Additionally, I've never felt burdened by the priesthood by any measure even approximating child birth. To even try to compare the two seems to me to be offensive to the process of giving birth.   One more thing, can you imagine how a couple would be drawn to one another if, when the husband were ill, he could look to his wife for a blessing, rather than the oft-unfamiliar home teachers? What of those who live in remote locations? How would these be comforted by the potential of a blessing being always present?"
lds,16y93x,Somsta,-1,Mon Jan 21 05:07:37 2013 UTC,"You don't understand the priesthood if you think it is male-only. I thought the temple explained this rather well.  Talmage's quote, I feel, is not 100% correct. See, whenever one acts under the authority of God to accomplish his purposes, isn't that the priesthood? Therefore, in this life, in this earth, right here, right now, there are many, many women ""bearing"" the priesthood, because they are serving in priesthood callings and offices, accomplishing the Lord's work no different than if any man were called to such a position (and often much better than any man could in that particular position.) This is not limited to the temple!  Do not get hung up on positions or titles. They are wholly irrelevant in the big picture. It simply doesn't matter if a man is ordained a deacon and dies or ordained an apostle and dies or even is never ordained and dies. We see John the Baptist seemingly live out his entire life without receiving the Melchizedek Priesthood, and that was according to God's will and desire and we are sure he is saved in the highest degrees of glory.  The church has a particular structure, and that structure is ordained by God, and if he wants to change it he will. We have seen the church constantly change its structure, so it will be no surprise if it changes again. Besides, we know that the ""higher"" one goes in the church, the more they must act like a servant. We have as our example Christ himself, who descended below all things, meaning, became lower than any other. He himself taught the apostles that the greatest among them will be the servant. If any church leader sees themself as above someone else, they are in gross error and need to repent or else their authority will end.  The order of things, as established by God in the Garden of Eden, is particular, but note carefully the wording that God gives to Eve. He places upon her to judge her husband's worthiness based on how he compares to God. Based on that judgment, she is then to either accept or reject his counsel and direction. The husband has no such direction. Instead, men are required to look to God and do as he is told to do by God. And what does God tell men to do in his priesthood manual and lessons and general conference? Love and serve and listen to and counsel with their wives.  Finally, read carefully the oath and covenant of the priesthood (D&C 84), and look carefully at the verbs used. Notice that ""being ordained"" is never a requirement. Those that receive the priesthood, and by the text, it appears to mean the servants of God rather than some ordinance, receive God, and thus they become servants of God as well, entitled to all the blessings imaginable and unimaginable.  I want you to understand that in my ward, as a ward leader, I accept and receive advice and counsel from any righteous priesthood bearer, especially the women. I have received instruction and direction by and through them, and I know for a fact those things were given to them by God for my benefit. Some held callings, some did not, and it didn't matter. They watch over the church as much as any priesthood holder."
lds,16y93x,cbfw86,1 point,Mon Jan 21 15:54:22 2013 UTC,"See, whenever one acts under the authority of God to accomplish his purposes, isn't that the priesthood?  They watch over the church as much as any priesthood holder.   So women don't hold the priesthood, but they bear it?  There are 0 women serving in priesthood callings or offices, because those callings and offices require the holding the priesthood.  There are, however, plenty of women serving in auxiliary callings.  Sometimes in these callings women receive certain privileges like exercising their priesthood leader's keys (RS presidents exercise the Bishop's keys to receive revelation for her RS).  But they do not hold the priesthood in so doing.  No one's arguing that women will be screwed over in the eternities.  The fact that men are directed to love and care for and listen to their wives has nothing to do with whether or not women hold the priesthood, and whether it's possible that one day they will.  D&C 84 is a discourse on the priesthood.  It talks about it being passed down through the laying of hands, and about using it to administer ordinances.  Women neither receive the priesthood by the laying on of hands, nor administer ordinances.  The verse I believe you're referring to, 33, promises blessings to whoever is faithful in ""obtaining"" the two priesthoods.  I find it unlikely that in this one verse, God switches from talking about holding the priesthood to accepting it as true and abiding by it, etc.  We're talking about a specific authority, almost an intangible possession, that is given to a person in a very specific manner.  Women do not have the priesthood conferred upon them.  They are not ordained to priesthood offices.  The do not hold, nor bear, the priesthood.  I'm not accusing the church of treating women as inferior, or demanding immediate changes and apologies.  Personally, I don't see a huge injustice in women not holding the priesthood, since the priesthood only blesses others.  And the tertiary blessings, like feeling the Spirit as you give a blessing, or feeling closer to your child as you baptize him, are blessings that can be found any number of ways.  And obviously, everyone has the opportunity to receive all the blessings from priesthood ordinances.  But a male-only priesthood feels wrong.  I'm not saying my feeling is God telling me how the church should be.  But I wonder if a higher law won't be revealed at some point in the future."

Women have no age requirement beyond that of being baptized at age 8.   Policy's have changed over the years on when you can get a recommend, for a while it was only for missionary's and people getting sealed in the temple to a living spouse. If you did not go on a mission then you would not get one until you passed the age of missionary service (25) for men. Women could have one issued if the women was believed to no longer be eligible as a wife (not a joke).  The wording was kinder then how I present it, these things changed quite some time ago and I don't have a specific refrence to show when this was last in place, you can refer to the old editions of the handbooks to check.  In order to avoid any confusion, this is the most current information/policy.  Hand book 1: 3.3   Members Receiving Their Own Endowment  Instructions for issuing a recommend to a person who is receiving his or her own endowment are in the temple recommend book. A man must hold the Melchizedek Priesthood to receive his temple endowment.  Most single members will be interviewed for a recommend for their own endowment when they are called as missionaries or when they are to be married in a temple. Single members in their late teens or early twenties who have not received a mission call or who are not engaged to be married in a temple should not be recommended to receive their own endowment. However, they may receive limited-use recommends to perform baptisms for the dead. The desire to observe temple marriages of siblings or friends is not a sufficient reason for a young adult to be endowed.  Worthy single members who have not received their endowment in connection with a mission or marriage may become eligible to receive the endowment when the bishop and the stake president determine that they are sufficiently mature to understand and keep the sacred covenants made in a temple. Such eligibility is determined individually for each person, not by using routine criteria such as reaching a certain age or leaving home for college or employment.  A worthy member who is married to an unendowed spouse, whether the spouse is a member or nonmember, may receive his or her own endowment when (1) the bishop receives written consent from the spouse and (2) the bishop and stake president are satisfied that the responsibility assumed with the endowment will not impair marital harmony.

Do you know if they allow 17 year old (almost 18) males to receive the Melchizedek priesthood and go through the temple if they've received mission calls?
lds,16xhqk,Thuseld,12,Sun Jan 20 14:38:29 2013 UTC,"First off, I believe it is a personal decision. These type of rules are reminiscent of the Pharisees to me. I don't believe they are of actual significance  While on my mission President Packer provided some perspective while addressing a mission conference. This is not doctrine and likely just his opinion, but it felt insightful to me. A missionary had asked him this question and he said to take any part of the sacrament that you can. He said it was of greater importance to partake then to get caught up in rules. Then he joked that it is far better to just be on time.   On a similar note, President Packer also said that there is nothing wrong with taking the sacrament twice.   Do what feels right, but don't get too caught up in. Remember what is really imprtant."

The sacrament table should be prepared before the meeting begins. For instructions on preparing, blessing, and passing the sacrament, see 20.4.  The passing of the sacrament should be natural and unobtrusive, not rigid or overly formal. Those who pass the sacrament should not be required to assume any special posture or action, such as holding the left hand behind the back. The process of passing the sacrament should not call attention to itself or detract from the purpose of the ordinance.""  source"

Our Bishop wanted to stop the tradition of people coming in late in the middle of passing the water, and having the deacons go back and get them the bread also.  He said, ""Being present for the prayer is part of the ordinance.""  Though I don't think this is official doctrine, I felt the Spirit-- it really rang true for me.  But because I'm unaware of any official doctrine, I wouldn't deny someone the sacrament that came in late without this sort of instruction from the current Bishop.

It's not Pharisaical because of what the Sacrament represents. It's not following a rigid rule just to follow a rigid rule, but taking these things that symbolize Christ's sacrifice, and renewing our baptismal covenants. For instance, a baptism isn't complete if you just get baptized and not confirmed, and I don't believe the sacrament is complete unless both are taken.   I don't watch other people take the sacrament, it ain't my business whether or not they do or do not.

I don't understand how your question isn't answered by the answer I already provided, so... High Priest stuff?  Just kidding - here's an article from Elder Sorensen about what High Priests do.   TL;DR? They do everything elders do while presiding over elders and everyone else. High priests are a leadership body - bishops, counselors (not always), stake presidents, mission presidents, temple presidents, and general authorities are called from high priest quorums across the church. Being called as a high priest is a sign of trust and added responsibility. In addition to presiding, overseeing home teaching and temple work, high priests are supposed to provide an example of dignity, righteousness, and priesthood leadership. Alma 13 suggests that high priests are supposed to teach the gospel and, ultimately, to provide a Christ-like example such that ""the people might know in what manner to look forward to his Son for redemption"". I always interpreted that verse to mean that when we interact with high priests it should be just like interacting with Christ - which may or may not be the case (depending on the high priest - I've known some real jerks who held the calling) but if you take all of that seriously - then there's a lot of dignity and trust in that calling.   EDIT: I didn't realize this - but all temple work carried out by a ward is overseen by the high priest's group. The High priest group also oversees home teaching assignments (the internet suggests that the HPG gets the assignments that require sensitivity and/or delicacy).  High priests also work with potential elders. So, quite a bit."

They’ve caused me, I think, to study and to ponder and to compare and in the long run to become even more convinced that the way I’ve chosen.   and   If there is a perception that you can’t be learned in this church and still be a mainstream member, I think that would be a most unfortunate perspective. And yet I’m sure it exists; I know it does, but there is something that holds sway over just the intellect, and that is the counsel of God. When that comes through men, who may be very fallible, that’s probably very difficult for people to accept. They may trust more in their intellectual conclusions and powers than they do in that mantle. That’s [how] really intellectual people in the church get into trouble when they do.

I think that there was only one moderated thread that left me really puzzled and wondering why it was moderated. There was a long post about church being boring, with most of the answers being to retreat into your own head and have a better church there. There was then a thread offering some constructive ideas for changes to make, but it was moderated. There was nothing controversial or revolutionary that I saw in the thread (it was mostly about variety and attention spans, and came from the perspective of a professional teacher), but it was moderated soon after being written.

My guess would be that main-stream members would reject your positions and rationales if given a chance to examine both sides of the issues involved.  Is that what you're trying to avoid?"
lds,16vzah,smacktaix,-2,Sun Jan 20 17:13:30 2013 UTC,"You're taking a silly, non-universal tradition and imbuing it with meaning that isn't even there. You end up being offensive when you attempt to rationalize your hard line position.   I'm not doing anything to the tradition. I honestly don't notice or care if a husband talks first or last. I do care when a woman attempts to reorder sacrament speakers intentionally to send a subversive message that undermines the Church.  Previous to her comment, I wouldn't have even thought anything about it if a wife asked to go second. I would have just thought she wanted the extra time to keep her nerves calm. Now I'll be aware of potential subversive intent."

lds,16vzah,lanfearl,9,Sun Jan 20 23:27:27 2013 UTC,I was giving an example of the current moderation policy and stating that I thought it was too extreme. I'm not sure how that doesn't add to the discussion.
lds,16vzah,smacktaix,4,Sat Jan 19 21:46:36 2013 UTC,"The solution is the moderators need to back off? It's fairly simple. I'm not sure what kind of ""solution"" we need, except for ""less moderation"""

lds,16vzah,wanderlust712,4,Sun Jan 20 05:18:27 2013 UTC,"Excuse me, but I believe that this exact opinion is the problem that everyone is talking about.  The opinion that you are correct, and the only person that is correct, and everything else is false.  I know you say that it's the church, so the information has a pass/fail on if you believe it.  However, by that logic your opinion should be that it's improper for a woman to wear a dress above her ankles, and absolutely no pants!  The church HAS changed over time, and part of that was I'm sure because of discussions similar to the type we would like to have here -- except those discussions were with the general authorities.  If members of this sub had a place where they could go to discuss their thoughts and opinions without running the risk of anti-LDS comments overtaking their original idea, I'm sure they would do that.  However, I believe that is what this sub-reddit was supposed to be.  Either that, or else a place to ask for help when they're struggling and need advise.  However, the fact that you, or the other mods, will delete or censor anything you feel is even remotely deviating from the teachings means that a lot of people aren't getting the help they need, or are getting it from the wrong sources."
lds,16vzah,jessemb,-5,Sun Jan 20 05:21:11 2013 UTC,"How is /r/exmormon ""ridiculous""?"
lds,16vzah,wanderlust712,9,Sun Jan 20 08:36:56 2013 UTC,"I wanted to add another point, but my last post is obscenely long.   I also think that submissions that include events relative to Mormonism should be allowed, even if people don't unnecessary agree with them. For example, Mormons getting involved in Pride Parades is very relevant to our discourse on the Church's stance on homosexuality as well as the issue of activism from members influencing the church (though there are those out there who don't believe in the latter.)  Similarly, you might not agree with ""Wear Pants to Church Day"" but it would seem to me that something big enough to warrant attention on NPR and the New York Times should survive moderation in r/lds."
lds,16vzah,jessemb,-4,Sun Jan 20 08:40:46 2013 UTC,Even if such topics are extremely likely to be invaded by /r/exmormon and degenerate into pointless arguments?
lds,16vzah,wanderlust712,15,Sun Jan 20 08:47:18 2013 UTC,"I've been regularly reading this subreddit for over a year and I have yet to see any of these ""invasions"" that people refer to.  I think that's where moderation does come into play. If a poster is clearly just looking for an argument (which I think is pretty easy to spot) then someone can remove or ban them."
lds,16vzah,jessemb,1 point,Sun Jan 20 08:54:45 2013 UTC,"Well, when a thread explodes with people talking about how the Church is stupid, it's not uncommon to find a thread in /r/exmormon linking directly to it.  It's an implicit invitation for people to come and provide downvotes and hassle us silly believers."
lds,16vzah,wanderlust712,8,Sun Jan 20 08:56:48 2013 UTC,"So even if it's totally relevant to issues in the church and a number of people here would like to discuss it, we shouldn't because some people might downvote us.   Right."
lds,16vzah,onewatt,2,Sun Jan 20 08:21:18 2013 UTC,"Hey, bring on the downvotes.  I don't care about that.  What I care about is creating a safe place for active, believing members to discuss their faith, without being constantly challenged for it.  Take the recent masturbation thread, for example.  There were between four and a dozen comments that were supportive and helpful.  The rest were, ""Dude, your religion is ridiculous, masturbation is awesome.""  At some point, the signal-to-noise ratio dips down too far to be recovered.  That's when we remove threads."
lds,16vzah,wanderlust712,6,Sun Jan 20 20:16:48 2013 UTC,"What about creating a safe place for active, believing members to discuss their faith and occasionally discuss issues they might have with church policy?  Because many of us feel that way and you're driving people away who you probably want to have around."
lds,16vzah,onewatt,2,Sun Jan 20 16:28:22 2013 UTC,"The problem is this:   Where do you draw the line on what issues with church policy are ok?  Because no matter where you draw it, there will be people on the far side of it who say it's not far enough."
lds,16vzah,jessemb,3,Sun Jan 20 00:06:47 2013 UTC,"You comment is a logical fallacy known as ""slippery slope"" and I'm not going to respond to it.    Furthermore, you're lumping all church policies and issues with them together.   There is a need for things to be discussed and the heavy-handed moderation here ignores that need and creates yet another place where questioning or even less-traditional Mormons are marginalized."
lds,16vzah,bobthereddituser,0,Sun Jan 20 00:19:38 2013 UTC,"It's not slippery slope, because I'm not indicating a progressive change or a culminative effect. I'm saying, no matter where you place the line of what conversation is okay, there will be people who disagree.   Reddit is hardly a community where questioning mormonism or less-traditional mormons are marginalized.  Once again, there are an immense number of subreddits to enjoy.  I suspect you're projecting your distaste for the church's ""all or nothing"" attitude onto this topic. Would that be a fair assessment?"
lds,16vzah,jessemb,0,Sun Jan 20 00:39:57 2013 UTC,"Well, there's /r/mormondebate, for one.  It's a little quiet now, but it's specifically designed for exactly the purpose that you want.  If that kind of space is important to you, maybe you should lead the charge over there?  I think /u/keraneuology would be happy to see more activity over there.  Heck, maybe I should spend more time there myself.  I think I'm gonna go subscribe now."
lds,16vzah,xochitec,2,Sun Jan 20 00:54:35 2013 UTC,Takes two to argue.
lds,16vzah,bobthereddituser,4,Sun Jan 20 00:57:03 2013 UTC,And I don't like the person I am when I'm one of those two.  :)
lds,16vzah,wanderlust712,5,Sun Jan 20 01:07:06 2013 UTC,And people look at me strange when I'm both of those two.
lds,16vzah,kayejazz,3,Sun Jan 20 01:13:19 2013 UTC,"I agree. I usually get sucked into them because I think ""hey, maybe I can actually change this guy's mind/teach him something/etc..."" Then, when it is done, I look at the full conversation and feel bad."
lds,16vzah,wanderlust712,-5,Sun Jan 20 01:21:05 2013 UTC,"I don't have any particular problems with either of those suggestions wanderlust712. But I do wonder two things 1) if you've called the most reactive mod in a subreddit known for reactivity a 'fucking asshole' why are you surprised when your content gets removed? and 2) if you don't like the moderation policy, why not take your content to r/mormon, r/mormons, or r/mormonism?"
lds,16vzah,kayejazz,7,Sun Jan 20 01:24:51 2013 UTC,"1) Is one comment of mine worth removing everything I post? And is does one comment of mine somehow justify mountains of rude comments (including telling me I was going to suffer for my wicked ways) from said moderator?  2) There just aren't enough Mormons on Reddit to have 8 different subs for Mormons. Maybe 2 or 3. And I do occasionally post to r/mormon, but I still think that the moderation here is inconsistent and out of control.   And lastly, while it was rude, I absolutely stand by that comment I made to that moderator. Maybe if more people were willing to say it, he'd leave.   We have to talk quick though, he might delete our post."
lds,16vzah,wanderlust712,3,Sun Jan 20 02:21:10 2013 UTC,I don't disagree with you really. I hope you find a happier medium!
lds,16vzah,kayejazz,-3,Sun Jan 20 01:30:05 2013 UTC,"That's verging on a personal attack. I'm leaving your comment, but please be nicer."
lds,16vzah,smacktaix,3,Sun Jan 20 01:45:09 2013 UTC,This is what he said to me.  And you're telling me to be nicer?
lds,16vzah,bobthereddituser,-1,Sun Jan 20 01:55:56 2013 UTC,I already tell him to be nicer. Repeatedly. Don't think I'm singling you out.
lds,16vzah,kayejazz,3,Sun Jan 20 02:11:19 2013 UTC,Is it working? Because I have yet to see the evidence.   Note that in another sub right now he's defending child marriage.
lds,16vzah,kayejazz,-5,Sun Jan 20 02:01:29 2013 UTC,"I've seen the comment posted in other places. I'm not going to defend that, except to say that in context, it at least makes sense. But that's beside the point.  Ultimately, I can't control him or you. I'm just asking you to be nicer. Like i do everybody."
lds,16vzah,wanderlust712,-9,Sun Jan 20 00:16:05 2013 UTC,"For example, Mormons getting involved in Pride Parades is very relevant to our discourse on the Church's stance on homosexuality as well as the issue of activism from members influencing the church (though there are those out there who don't believe in the latter.)   It's not LDS positive. The pursuant discussion is horrific. It won't be allowed.  ""Wear Pants to Church Day"" was discussed ad nauseam. It wasn't removed because we disagreed, but because the whole front page was pants posts, all having the same argument over and over again. It had devolved into spam and was therefore banned."
lds,16vzah,xochitec,9,Sun Jan 20 00:39:29 2013 UTC,"How about leaving every topic and only removing comments that are disrespectful and discourteous? Are we moderating the content or the atmosphere?  Franky, for a worldwide church, there should be no topic that is off limits. ""I'm homosexual and feeling ostracized at church"" and ""The church hates homosexuals"" are two entirely different attitudes of addressing the same topic. ""I'm curious about this {random historical thing about Joseph Smith}"" and ""Don't you mormons realize that JS was a complete fraud because of {random historical thing}?"" are two different ways of discussing the same topic.   I think no posting should ever be removed based on content, just civility and 3 Nephi 11:29..."
lds,16vzah,Prcrstntr,2,Sun Jan 20 00:45:35 2013 UTC,"That's usually the first line of defense. There are a lot more threads with half the comments deleted that stay up than are taken down. One recent example is the thread about City Creek. Controversial, but still there, with comments removed. If a post gets removed, it's usually for a good reason."

lds,16vzah,xochitec,1 point,Sun Jan 20 00:48:41 2013 UTC,"Usually, a mod will leave a message about removing a post. Comments are harder because they will still appear in your comment history. If your comments are removed for breaking sidebar rules, I usually will send a warning through PM.

lds,16vzah,LordofKleenex,10,Sun Jan 20 00:59:01 2013 UTC,That's the problem.   There just aren't enough Mormons to keep that many subs active.
lds,16vzah,georgewchubby,9,Sun Jan 20 08:24:36 2013 UTC,"Right, the only subs with active discussion are /r/lds and /r/exmormon.  It would be nice to get /r/mormon active."
lds,16vzah,onewatt,7,Sun Jan 20 01:44:42 2013 UTC,Maybe they just need to be invited to an activity?
lds,16vzah,amertune,4,Sun Jan 20 03:14:25 2013 UTC,There's a reason for that.
lds,16vzah,onewatt,7,Sat Jan 19 22:55:12 2013 UTC,That's a great analysis.  I would like to see /r/mormon grow.
lds,16vzah,4blockhead,3,Sat Jan 19 23:35:15 2013 UTC,There could be if people used those subs more (and this one less).
lds,16vzah,onewatt,1 point,Sat Jan 19 23:38:30 2013 UTC,I can think of at least 7 more...
lds,16vzah,jessemb,1 point,Sat Jan 19 22:32:44 2013 UTC,"So, for those Mormons who want a good discussion without insults, overhanded moderation, etc. they have those? You know they aren't active, right?"
lds,16vzah,jessemb,5,Sun Jan 20 00:25:57 2013 UTC,"They could be. You'd have to make that effort - but seeing that Mormonism is at least part of the fabric you're cut from, a tortuous move and reconstruction shouldn't be that hard."
lds,16vzah,Honeybeard,2,Sun Jan 20 00:42:57 2013 UTC,/r/truelds? ;)
lds,16vzah,CrazyStatistician,3,Sun Jan 20 00:51:25 2013 UTC,"It only creates controversy and mistrust when a ""true"" group splinters off another group.  For example, I've been a member of /r/Christianity for almost a year.  Quite a few months ago, a very conservative Christian poster denounced the subreddit, claiming it was full of heathen liberal heretics who were desecrating the faith for not accepting the every single word in the Bible is true.  He then went on to create his own subreddit, r/TrueChristian.  This implied that every single person on r/Christianity was a ""fake"" Christian.  It came off as super high and mighty, judgmental, and prideful.  It would be a disaster if that happened here.  It would be the exact same.  We don't need Mormons arguing with each other over doctrinal differences."
lds,16vzah,DesolationRobot,3,Sun Jan 20 05:53:16 2013 UTC,I'll admit that my comment was meant as a joke - I was surprised that it even existed.    I agree with your points.
lds,16vzah,bobthereddituser,0,Sun Jan 20 01:17:18 2013 UTC,"/r/mormon. Or their own community. Ready, go."
lds,16vzah,smacktaix,3,Sun Jan 20 01:41:56 2013 UTC,Their own community? So separate the Mormons that don't feel the same as you?
lds,16vzah,Honeybeard,6,Sun Jan 20 01:28:32 2013 UTC,"I really don't want to see that happen, and I know that there are others in /r/lds who have expressed the same sentiment. I think that we all have a lot to learn from others who don't feel the same, and I'd hate to see a reddit Mormon schism."
lds,16vzah,amertune,3,Sun Jan 20 01:14:28 2013 UTC,"Thank you. I applaud your comment. I really do. I want to see more of this (and people like you) in this subforum. Please speak up people, please!"
lds,16vzah,kayejazz,3,Sun Jan 20 03:09:52 2013 UTC,"It's not that I want to exclude them, but I want to encourage people to respect the rules of the subreddits they participate in. When that can't happen, they absolutely ought to create a new subreddit with those of like minds to participate in.    For example, I have 2 other private lds related subreddits where about 15 or 17 members of /r/lds and I can discuss things which may not be appropriate to /r/lds. It's been awesome."
lds,16vzah,Honeybeard,3,Sun Jan 20 03:12:26 2013 UTC,So we will have a million little subreddits for every faction? I personally see that as divisive.
lds,16vzah,kayejazz,2,Sat Jan 19 23:35:25 2013 UTC,I think there will be a new direction at /r/mormon in the near future. Meaning now. :)
lds,16vzah,wanderlust712,1 point,Sun Jan 20 15:58:02 2013 UTC,"But if the divisions exist, what other solution is there?  The fact is that /r/lds and /r/mormon are already divided, though they ostensibly exist for the same community, and that division has served the majority of lds redditors well."
lds,16vzah,kayejazz,0,Sun Jan 20 18:39:57 2013 UTC,"Literally any other subreddit, especially the various flavors of /exmormon, perhaps?  The comment section of FMH?  Facebook?"
lds,16vzah,jessemb,-1,Sat Jan 19 23:50:25 2013 UTC,"If people aren't members of the Church, and don't like the way we moderate this subreddit, /r/exmormon seems like the natural fit.  If they are Mormon and want to debate tricky issues, /r/mormondebate seems like the best place to do it.  I know that subreddit is alive, given the huge response to the pants thread a while back.  If they have one specific issue that they feel strongly about, and wish to discuss that issue with like-minded individuals, it is probable that there are better places to do it than here.  FMH for feminism, for example.  I know that there are a million Mormon blogs out there--surely one of them is discussing what you want to discuss?  You seem to be assuming that I'm judging or attacking you by attempting to preserve a certain atmosphere in a small corner of the Internet.  Nothing could be further from the truth."
lds,16vzah,ainigma,6,Sun Jan 20 03:10:22 2013 UTC,"There seems to be a certain list of topics (non anti mormon) which are are not allowed, even if the conversation remains civil and polite.   Such as?  I'm not a member, and this subreddit is everything I expected it to be. Everything you would discuss in church (and perhaps Temple) and inbetween members."
lds,16vzah,smacktaix,11,Sun Jan 20 05:06:54 2013 UTC,"We had two posts about ""Let Women Pray in General Conference"" (both by /u/brown3218) that got deleted recently (link and link). I imagine he or she is upset and is raising this topic because of that."
lds,16vzah,xochitec,4,Sun Jan 20 09:03:56 2013 UTC,"My understanding is that topics that have been done to death were subject to removal. Thus they still fit within the guidelines, but are not really adding to the community.   IANAM, but that was my understanding."
lds,16vzah,onewatt,9,Sun Jan 20 16:44:15 2013 UTC,"If they aren't contributing, why not allow the upvote/downvote system to determine that? No need to remove them."
lds,16vzah,Honeybeard,-5,Sun Jan 20 17:09:08 2013 UTC,Because upvote/downvote doesn't reflect the content we want to cultivate in this subreddit due to the philosophies of the upvoters and downvoters.
lds,16vzah,xochitec,3,Mon Jan 21 02:16:10 2013 UTC,"IANAM is a good acronym, I'm going to use that.  I swear I read a few months ago that because this subreddit is slow, there was no real need to delete duplicate threads that reappeared every so often. Homosexuality is a topic I feel is brought up a lot around these parts (and for most of the time with good reasons.)"
lds,16vzah,xochitec,6,Sun Jan 20 22:34:13 2013 UTC,"In a way, it does seem that we have the same conversations over and over again (the Word of Wisdom seems to be the most frequent conversation). I don't think that repeated conversations is usually used as grounds for moderation, unless those conversations touch on feminism, homosexuality, or even any sexuality. I think of those topics as an unwritten policy, they're not expressly forbidden but they're nearly always removed.  I'd vote that if sexuality and feminism are forbidden topics then the moderation policy should make that explicit."
lds,16vzah,xochitec,6,Sun Jan 20 01:03:01 2013 UTC,"I'd vote that if sexuality and feminism are forbidden topics then the moderation policy should make that explicit.   I would agree with that. And have suggested it. i don't think it's so much that the topic is disallowed as it is that those discussions almost always devolve into a ""the church is dumb/oppressing/ridiculous for asserting _______________"" At some point, those kinds of comments outweigh the helpful, positive ones and the whole thread gets removed.  *To clarify: I didn't intend to say those topics should be removed. I meant that we should be more clear in the policy if they are going to be removed."
lds,16vzah,xochitec,2,Sun Jan 20 03:08:58 2013 UTC,"Furthermore, I'd imagine this subreddit is one that is safe for the eyes and ears for members. Whereas Mormon discussion has it's place on other subreddits, this subreddit would not want to be (a) reason as to why a member develops doubts about the Church. (Again, I'd imagine that) there are many places, especially on Reddit, that would easily dismiss the Church in favour of their own personal view, however /r/lds isn't one of them. Please correct me mods if I am mistaken."
lds,16vzah,onewatt,2,Sun Jan 20 03:14:07 2013 UTC,"That is the ultimate goal of r/lds. To have a place where members can come and it is okay for them to be members, without attacks or censure for choosing to be a member. Without the ""you're church is wrong/abusive/cultish/insert negativity here."" And it's a hard line to walk."
lds,16vzah,onewatt,6,Sun Jan 20 03:50:57 2013 UTC,"But some of us are believing members who still want to discuss those topics. And when censorship is so bad that we can't discuss them, you're driving away a whole different population."
lds,16vzah,onewatt,3,Sun Jan 20 05:20:32 2013 UTC,"You want to discuss the church being a cult? Take it elsewhere.  You want to discuss controversial topics? Keep it under control and I'll leave it up. I'll even fight other mods to keep it up, if I think it's following the sidebar. If you feel like it was removed and shouldn't have been or no explanation was given, message the mods for clarification.  Any post that starts out with the supposition that the church is wrong is removed. Likewise with comments."
lds,16vzah,smacktaix,3,Sun Jan 20 09:03:14 2013 UTC,"I'll just add my voice as a second witness to Kayejazz's comments here.  I love having a hearty discussion, as long as it's building up instead of tearing down."
lds,16vzah,smacktaix,2,Sun Jan 20 16:11:40 2013 UTC,"But see, that's the problem. There's no agreement about what it means to be Mormon. Calling yourself an unorthodox Mormon still assumes some sort of agreement on the Mormon part. It assumes some sort of uncontested common ground. But not even that exists.  So...  If you want to persuade others that these topics are okay, then you have to take a step back and start with what it means to be Mormon. After that has been settled, everything else will fall into place naturally."
lds,16vzah,smacktaix,-11,Sat Jan 19 19:32:38 2013 UTC,"But some of us are believing members who still want to discuss those topics.   Then use another site or sub to discuss them.

lds,16vzah,smacktaix,6,Sat Jan 19 22:51:05 2013 UTC,"I agree.  However, this subreddit is one place active members can go if they have questions about these sensitive topics.  It would be a shame to silence that here."
lds,16vzah,xochitec,7,Sat Jan 19 19:40:24 2013 UTC,"We tried leaving stuff like that up in the past. Here's what happens, without fail:  The first several comments are positive and helpful - just what the person wanted.  The next 2 days are full of non-lds redditors telling the member why he or she should ignore the gospel.  Also, the member often got PMs from exmormons inviting them to discuss the matter in a private sub with other exmos who have 'found a better way,' etc.   All that, unfortunately, leaves us in a tough position.

lds,16vzah,onewatt,0,Sat Jan 19 19:45:26 2013 UTC,I doubt that sexuality and feminism (hmm - maybe not feminism) are forbidden per se - I would imagine that the threads get deleted because soooo many of the comments them begin with the assumption that the church's policies are false and devolve from there.   EDIT: I reported the masturbation thread because I thought Xochitec's description of mutually masturbating with his wife was really tacky. The nice or worst thing about R/LDS is that because all of the pro-Church scripture/topic study threads get so little attention that we'll be back to masturbation/feminism/word of wisdom/the mall in a few weeks anyway.
lds,16vzah,onewatt,5,Sat Jan 19 23:05:34 2013 UTC,"I reported the masturbation thread because I thought Xochitec's description of mutually masturbating with his wife was really tacky   This is good to know.  I didn't see it this way, but debated seriously whether to include it.  If I had known or been told this, I would have edited it.  I thought it was valuable to the OP to include because of his idea in the post that his wife will reject him because he has masturbated.  In any event, my comment was removed.  Yet the OP's entire post did not have to be removed for my one single comment that I could have edited in a few seconds.  In any event, what I had to say had value and I'm glad the OP had a chance to read it.  EDIT: I removed that part from the corresponding thread in /r/mormon"

I thought most of your point was generally fine. I think sex-ed is fine. I think its great - we probably need more of it in the USA. Actually, I would be interested in taking a sex-ed sunday school/institute class if it was taught by a mental health/health professional I trusted.    From my point of view/in my opinion, you wiped out the usefulness of the rest of your post by including something that seems really private with a bunch of strangers on the internet.

EDIT: Case in point? You already snagged a downvote (not mine) for that comment. It rubs some people who like the church the wrong way to be challenged every single day in a subreddit which is theoretically supposed to be pro-Mormon. There are a lot of us who wonder why, when you guys already have r/mormon, r/mormondebate, r/mormonism, r/exmormon, r/exmormonteen, etc. etc. etc. you have to come over here with your criticism.

lds,16v5ar,NoddysShardblade,1 point,Sat Jan 19 07:56:51 2013 UTC,"Exactly. Also remember that an autism diagnosis can, quite literally, mean that you are completely normal in every way, but just that some of your communication and social skills are learned rather than instinctive.   It means you consciously understand people in a way that NT people don't.  Especially if you were so sure of yourself in this regard before - likely the diagnosis means nothing. High-functioning autism is a long way from being a disability. Pretty much ever scientist who ever discovered anything of value had it. You certainly wouldn't be reading this without hundreds of people who did."
lds,16v5ar,cashmo,5,Sat Jan 19 20:20:59 2013 UTC,"I just want to remind you that your disability/diagnosis DOES NOT define you, it is simply one facet of who you are. As the husband of a special education teacher I learned long ago that your are not an autistic person, you are a person with autism. If you were confident in your ability to make friends and serve in callings before, then you should still be just as confident now. You didn't suddenly contract autism, this is how you have always been, and if it wasn't a problem before then it shouldn't be a problem now. If you are worried about what people in your ward will think, don't tell them. There is no reason you need to declare it. As I said, it doesn't define you, it is just one aspect of who you are. I have had experiences that have have very much shaped who I am, but I don't just come right out and tell them to everyone I talk to. They have affected me, but they do not define me. Just be yourself, and be confident about who you are. You are the exact same person you were before you received the diagnosis.   Now, here is what my wife (the special education teacher) says:    Keep in mind that autism is a label used to help you get any help you may need in the future / help you explain any issues you may have had in the past. The label is a tool for you to use, not who you are. You woke up the day after the diagnosis as the exact same person you were when you went to sleep the day before it. As a teacher, labels are used to help kids get the services they need to be successful. I had a student once that was diagnosed with down syndrome, and he very clearly also had autism, but his parents refused to have him tested. Had he been tested and diagnosed with autism, the teaching and interaction style used for him would not have changed at all, because he had not changed. He would have been the exact same boy before and after.   You shouldn't feel embarrassed/ashamed for being diagnosed with autism. If you don't feel comfortable telling people, then don't, but don't hide it away either. It is part of who you are. Sharing with others may help more than you may realize. Even if there is no one in your ward with autism, it is common enough that it is likely someone knows about it. Even if people don't, just sharing that you feel lonely may get you the comfort you need, it's an emotion everyone can relate to.   I don't feel that i can truly articulate exactly what i am trying to say. I understand how it could make you think and feel differently about yourself but just know that you truly are the same person. And don't forget that Heavenly Father loves you just the same.   PS the church doesn't have the best resources regarding disabilities.     My wife said that she is more than happy to keep talking to you about it and answer any questions you may have, or even just be there to listen to you. Just send me a PM and start it with ""for your wife"" or something like that (she doesn't really come on reddit)."

It's certainly a shock to receive a diagnosis as such. Remember--you're still you, regardless of names and titles you receive, whether principia persona or autism sufferer.  Good luck friend. I hope we can be a comfort and resource as you adjust to this new information. You're not alone."
lds,16v5ar,Thuseld,3,Sat Jan 19 19:53:38 2013 UTC,I'm not autistic but I do have a different disorder and have often felt the way you describe feeling now. some scriptures that have helped me are:  Mosiah 14:3-5 Matthew 11:28-30 Moroni 10:32-33 D&C 122:7-8  I like these ones because they directly relate to Christ's atonement and when I feel that there is no one who knows what it is that I am going through they remind me that Christ knows exactly what I am going through and knows exactly how to make it all better.

lds,16v5ar,Super_delicious,2,Sat Jan 19 16:15:05 2013 UTC,"I think because I now realize that everything I used to cope with my communication problems was just a construct. Before, I was pretty good at faking some social grace by imitating my more charismatic friends, and it worked for me with making friends and serving. And I didn't even realize I was faking; I assumed that was how everybody did it.  When I was diagnosed, I learned it was common for autistic women to imitate social graces, and some of them became quite good at it. Suddenly it hit me that everything I had done before was just a construct and a coping mechanism, and that while I felt I was succeeding in overcoming my social awkwardness, I was just covering it up, and that no matter how I tried, it would never go away. This realization disturbed me, still does in fact; I had basically been living a lie up until that point.  I'm certain that I'm looking at this from the wrong perspective, but since it has been pointed out to me, it's been hard to go back to that construct. I can't even remember what I tried so hard to learn anymore, and I don't know how much of me is me, and how much was the imitation I was constructing.    I feel like I haven't been as clear on this as I could. In truth, it's not clear to me at this point either."

D&C clearly states that Adam lived 6000 years ago   The verses you quote don't even mention Adam, so saying it ""clearly states"" he lived 6000 years ago is obviously overstating your case. I understand the doctrine of there being seven seals representing seven dispensations of 1000 years, but I think given that we're interpreting the book of Revelations of all things, easily the most symbolic book in all of scripture, there's a little room for interpretation, don't you think? Or do you think a star called wormwood is literally going to fall from the sky and poison the waters?   If you want other quotes from the leaders of the church then I'd be happy to provide them.    Anyone in this sub can tell you it's easy to find quotes from church leaders that have been subsequently declared non-doctrinal or that conflict with each other. Get over it.   You are trying to mold the doctrine because it isn't jiving with science.    You are trying to force an overly literal interpretation of everything to try and make our doctrine seem less plausible. Get over yourself."
lds,16u9a0,brown3218,9,Sat Jan 19 23:48:39 2013 UTC,"I think that when you have to go through this many gyrations to make something make sense, maybe some silly assumptions are being made."

lds,16u9a0,onewatt,-3,Sat Jan 19 14:32:12 2013 UTC,"I don't agree. At no point do we see the Fall presented as a ""immediately after being driven from the Garden, wham bam then came Seth"".  Indeed, the Fall is presented disjointed in Genesis from the rest of the creation accounts."
lds,16u9a0,crashohno,9,Fri Jan 18 21:43:04 2013 UTC,I don't know. The simplest answer is often the correct answer. You are making a lot of assumptions
lds,16u9a0,UPSguy,1 point,Fri Jan 18 21:56:46 2013 UTC,"You are right, there is no simple answer. When you assume the lds church is true then you have to set a lot of things aside on a shelf  of ""faith"". You do this because not everything is directly compatible with science, at least on the surface.   It's in our nature to try and sort ideas out and make sense of things. In LDS culture though, this can result in the ""deep doctrine"" that some people love to talk about. Some people create elaborate theories that are not supported by official doctrine whatsoever all in the name of trying to make sense of the two conflicting worlds of science and religion. You may say that the two don't conflict at all, but IMO the brethren are pretty straight forward in the fact that they don't have all of the answers and that some things are to be accepted on faith for now. So the simplest answer is, we don't know. Others will continue to theorize, like the OP, and the church will continue to not get into the weeds and details on the specifics of the fall, Noah's ark, BOM geography, etc.. Because they don't have the answers."
lds,16u9a0,onewatt,5,Sat Jan 19 07:12:25 2013 UTC,"Similar thoughts on the subject:   I had an institute teacher who had read the bible in over 12 languages, and who was a bible scholar of some renown. He felt the best translation of the idea / word of 'create' or 'creation' used in the Genesis account would be to express the idea of taking something which has already been used, and putting it to new use. His analogy was to go into the cupboard, find something you stored there, and bring it out to make cookies with.   I've always found the idea fascinating, as, to me, that answers a lot of questions. The earth was created, had some use, then was set aside until needed for humanity. Then made paradisical, and given to man, who brought about the fall, allowing death, again, on a planet which had experienced death in a previous 'incarnation.'"

Then- ""And the Gods planted a garden, eastward in Eden, and there they put the man, whose spirit they had put into the body which they had formed.""  Use of the word planted is interesting in this scripture because it suggests that the Gods took something from somewhere else and put it here, on the earth."

lds,16u9a0,brown3218,5,Sat Jan 19 07:02:19 2013 UTC,"I'd welcome some citations from church leaders.    I'd also point out that ours is a religion which believes in updating what we know. For example, the language of the bible, or the temple ceremony.  To write off a theory as incompatible without thought or conversation is, in my opinion, a very casual assessment. I'd sure like to have some information, or counter arguments rather than assertions."

Although you are right, most people here are trying to instill doubt in you. In any Mormon. They are not evil, and those questions should not be ignored. Just remember that you should approach reddit, and life, with an empty cup asking to fill it rather then a full one shouting about how you have it all. But be careful, some people want to hurt you, watch your back.  Anyway, /r/exmormon sent me here, you just hit the front page there."
lds,16ukx8,SingularityGuy,33,Sun Jan 20 06:28:10 2013 UTC,"/r/exmormon checking in.    We're not all faith destroyers, nor is that the primary motivation for most of us when engaging a discussion.  Most of the time, it's about the topic at hand.  Sometimes it's about destroying faith, however, that's usually not the case because you have the right to believe in whatever you like.  1st amendment freedom.    At the same time, when a believer locks horns for some reason, then there's a rumble.  The Church has missionaries, and preaches that members spread the gospel.  Not only that, but when a believer feels the spirit it usually ends up in quotations on a Monson pic, and shared on facebook.  When we disagree, it's persecution, and that persecution complex is annoying.  My thinking your beliefs are nuts is not persecution.  It's my own educated opinion that I spent hours upon hours researching.    Yes, please stay true to yourselves and live your lives the way you want to live.  I don't recommend the church, but it's your choice.  As far as embracing ambiguity goes?!?!   Why would you suggest such a thing?   That's the same as saying ""I know some things don't make sense, but just go with it.""    I'd recommend changing that portion.  Just a thought.    Lastly, we're not bad people us exmos.  What we are, are your family and friends that chose not to embrace mormonism.  We simply believe that it is false.  That's it.  Just the fact that you're being warned to stay away from us hurts because like I said, ""We're your family and friends."""
lds,16ukx8,iambookus,17,Sun Jan 20 07:08:03 2013 UTC,"Also saw this from /r/exmormon. I'll chime in.  The surest way to maintain beliefs is to never confront them, to only give ear to those who believe with you. If your goal is to maintain your belief, then avoiding other perspectives and beliefs is your best bet.  However, you should recognize that laced beneath this rational is the notion that you cannot trust yourself and your own judgement. That somehow (despite their truthfulness) your beliefs will not hold up to scrutiny.  If your goal is instead loyalty to truth (whatever it may be), then expanding your perspectives can only help.  Whatever your goal may be, and whatever path you choose, I'll just say this- in my experience, in the end it is always better to confront your fear rather than ignore it."
lds,16ukx8,bewilderedbear,9,Sun Jan 20 13:29:07 2013 UTC,"A lot of this is useful to anyone discovering Reddit for the first time. A few comments:  You've got the mask thing backwards  Disinhibiting environments like the Internet help people remove the masks that they wear in daily life, or else try on new ones to see if they fit better. Meaning if someone's a jerk on Reddit but nice ""in real life,"" it's sort of like being rude to the waitstaff; it means that deep down, they're probably a jerk.  Asking questions is not bad  Concern trolling is a real thing, especially on subjects like religion that some people love to argue. That doesn't mean that everyone who asks you how you know the difference between the Holy Ghost and your own feelings is a concern troll. It also doesn't mean that the questions are illegitimate, even if the person asking them is non-Mormon, and even if they are wary of your church instead of really excited and interested like you seem to want them to be.  People could be skeptical of your church for a variety of reasons. Its teachings could go against their morals or conscience (there's a lot of Values Dissonance around LGBT issues for instance). They might see things you take for granted differently, and they don't feel any particular need to accept your answers if they don't make sense to them (such as to maintain a faith in your church which they don't have). That doesn't make them shadowy monsters in the mists of darkness who are plotting to lead little Mormons astray. Most people outside your church don't really care about it, to be honest, unless it got in their faces or stepped on their toes.  Concern trolls notwithstanding, the way you're talking about this isn't helping. I personally feel that someone who reads this and later on has a bad experience on Reddit will feel that ""the Spirit is telling me I should leave"" instead of asking themselves why they feel uncomfortable.  I'm not saying they should ignore their discomfort. I'm saying it feels like you're inoculating people against empathy."
lds,16ukx8,onewatt,5,Sat Jan 19 01:05:13 2013 UTC,"It's an interesting question - about the masks. Does the anonymity of the internet set people free or does it mask them?

Last I heard, they were trying to reconcile.  So drinking is against what our church leaders have told us. Let that guy work it out between himself and God. No reason for you to get involved.

Whenever I joined the Church and kept drinking (I quit two years ago), the first time that I admitted to my Bishop (it was the same Ward that I was Baptised in), he didn't even bat an eye.   I suspect it's because of the first thing that he told me right after I got Baptised...""now, I know that it's going to take a lifetime to overcome your bad habits, since you've spent a lifetime building them up"".

Why not study next week's Gospel Doctrine and/or Lorenzo Snow chapter?"
lds,16tjrf,Thuseld,2,Fri Jan 18 17:49:37 2013 UTC,"Sunday School is not like this though. This won't be led by a teacher. I can read through, ignore posts I don't find interesting, and get involved in comment threads that I do like. In Sunday School, if you go off on a tangent, then the whole class is off on a tangent. A good teacher knows how to stop tangents, but that still means the class goes in the direction the teacher wants. This idea means it can do in loads of different directions, and you participate in the ones that you want to."
lds,16tjrf,iwasazombie,2,Fri Jan 18 18:01:54 2013 UTC,"I suppose you're right. I just feel like most members don't even take Sunday School or Priesthood/Relief Society serious enough to have good, on-topic discussions about what the church would like us to be learning.

We don't actually have a teacher right now either. I feel that our stand in doesn't get the inspiration a set apart teacher would receive. Add that to the fact that he is a bad teacher, a massive bigot, and very boring. This all makes for a bad time.

What we consider ""failure"" could be nothing more than a lesson we are to learn in this life. But we put a finality on it when we call it ""failure"". Ridiculous. SECOND, ""blame""??!?! It's an asinine belief in society that when something undesirable happens we have to ""blame"" someone or something. That carries shame and negates ACCOUNTABILITY. We are accountable for our part in any given situation, especially when it comes to asking God to help us with something. If we don't succeed in something that we prayed for, we simply look at our own actions in the situation, put away our personal whipping stick, and figure out what we can do next time. We give thanks to God for our successes as the giver of all good things - but try to give thanks to God for our road-bumps and not always giving us everything WE want when we want it, for the experience of learning and growing. So, maybe the statement should read something like this:  If you succeed, thank God. If you don't succeed, ask yourself what you can learn from that experience."

The reason why we are thankful is because God has our best interests in mind. Challenges like failure are given to us for a purpose, most likely to help us learn and grow. If we, as Christians, do not learn to accept the good and the bad with a thankful heart, then we have learned nothing at all.  As to the idea that we can do anything under our own power, do you not forget that we are a creation of God? The only reason we are allowed to exist moment to moment on this earth, despite our sinful natures, is because of Christ's atoning sacrifice? That the only reason we have the freedom to choose anything is because God intentionally set about to grant us our agency?  The idea that God sacrificed all these things for us to have a few moments on earth to live as we see fit, and then to turn around and pretend like any of it is due to our own efforts, is the ultimate exercise in pride. God didn't have to do these things. He chose to do it. He chose to do it because he cares more about us than himself.  So yes, even if I planted the seed, harvested it, ground it up, and baked it into bread, I am still going to thank God for the bread he gave me, because he gave me the earth and the seed, the air and sunshine and rain in its due season, the energy and time and freedom to choose what to do with it, and the knowledge and faith needed to put things together in a way that benefits myself."

Stake formation is just a shell game shifting around units.  I'd much prefer to talk about unit growth.
lds,16tg9h,jgardner,-1,Fri Jan 18 20:12:25 2013 UTC,"I disagree. I think the stake count is the only useful number.  See, if you give me a thousand saints, you can make a stake if and only if there are hundreds of members who are set on a solid foundation and all but unshakeable in the faith. This implies that they have among themselves enough experience and expertise that almost everything you expect the church to do can be done.  If you gave me another group of saints who didn't have this rock-solid foundation, you can't build a stake. We'd need to import leadership and work hard to bring them to a point where they can run a stake on their own. In that process, a large number may come and go and it means almost nothing.  So tell me there are a million saints in a certain corner of the world, and I don't know what that means. Are they self-sufficient? Do they know the gospel well, and have they built on the rock or some other foundation? But tell me there are a hundred stakes in a corner of the world, and I know exactly what is going on.

The church used to NEVER remove records, until a lawsuit made it illegal to forever retain a person in your membership. But it's still very difficult, and you can't just hit an ""unsubscribe"" button. Most Mormons drift into inactivity, or eventually just attend another church - but still remain on church membership rolls.

lds,16tg9h,jgardner,3,Fri Jan 18 15:40:55 2013 UTC,"I don't have any hard numbers on the total membership, but if you just look at the leadership of the time, it was a big deal."
lds,16tg9h,johnybackback,2,Fri Jan 18 16:02:10 2013 UTC,It was a very big deal. A huge growth period in the maturity of the Church and its members. Much more of the doctrine gelled in this period than at any other point. Plus the renewed emphasis on missions to all corners of the earth.
lds,16tg9h,jgardner,2,Fri Jan 18 16:07:16 2013 UTC,"My impression has always been that it was over half of the Church. I don't have a reference (at least, not likely anymore).

lds,16tg9h,johnybackback,3,Fri Jan 18 16:02:43 2013 UTC,"To be fair, they do use recent data to give a shade of credibility to their claims.

These kinds of analyses are, of course, subject to the paradox that the future doesn't necessarily conform to the expectations established on the past."
lds,16tg9h,panserbjorner,3,Fri Jan 18 16:04:14 2013 UTC,"Mathematically speaking, a 1:5 baptism rate would be exponential growth.  Linear growth would be if we only added a constant number of members a year, which would happen if we only sent a constant number of missionaries.  I do recall that when I was a missionary in the late '90s, it seemed like there were more missionaries than today. That could be simple demographics, since I'm a child of a baby boomer. In that regard, total church membership is not as important as the ratio of members to the population. We're aiming for 100%, not a certain number."
lds,16tg9h,notrab,1 point,Fri Jan 18 21:38:15 2013 UTC,"1:5 baptism rate of missionaries going out. Very, very slow exponential growth though, as if 5 people come in, how many serve missions?

lds,16tg9h,YeechangLee,6,Fri Jan 18 21:39:28 2013 UTC,"The thing to remember is that the church as of 1880 has already imploded. The organization as known by Joseph Smith no longer exists in a form he would recognize as his own.  Like all human organizations, they change and adapt to the world in which they live. I agree that too often critics are prone to exaggeration. One thing I can say is that the Mormonism of my childhood is different than the internet Mormonism you see here in r/LDS. If the organization doesn't change, then it will disappear, but as the very article it mentions, talking openly about seer stones is no longer viewed ""anti-Mormon.""   And this is true for all religions. Catholicism after the Vatican II was very different than what it had been before that.   My view is that in the next 20 years you will see some major changes, and that they will not be able to stay in this middle path between fundamentalist and intellectuals. So you will see either them become more liberalizing and follow more of an RLDS/COC path, or become more insular and like the FLDS minus polygamy.   All these chapel Mormons that exist largely in ignorance will either leave or become more nuanced believers because the bubble of ignorance they have lived in is no longer tenable. So that is what is meant by ""Death of the church.""  If the Mormon Stories/NOM crowd take over the church, wouldn't that be the death of it as we know it?"
lds,16tg9h,panserbjorner,0,Fri Jan 18 18:01:49 2013 UTC,"I think you're inventing a divide when it doesn't exist.  I can't imagine anything like Vatican II happening in our church. The biggest thing that ever happened to us was the manifesto on polygamy, and even then it was understood from day 1 that it was not always going to be a commandment.  The church membership has been all over the place since 1830, but I don't think Joseph Smith would find anything odd about the church structure itself. In fact, I think he would be very pleased with our Church Handbook of Instructions and our attempts to do things the way the Lord wants it done rather than the way we think is best.  Yes, I do foresee a time that the church members will be deceived and tried and even the very elect will leave the church. This may accompany a significant decrease in church membership, or worse, many members claiming to uphold the church but teaching some foreign doctrine. (We already see this happening in small numbers.)  But we've already experienced that in our church's history, so it won't be anything new.  Many members are not properly preparing themselves for the individual spiritual crisis that awaits all of us, but that's not new either. Just last conference we were warned that the days of bringing your kids to the three-hour block plus mutual being enough to safeguard them were over a long time ago. Joseph Smith warned the Kirtland saints that the miracles they witnessed during and after the dedication of the temple did not imply that they could get by without individual pray and scripture study and attending to family and church duties. (Did they all listen? No, but many did.)  What I also foresee is a day when the church will be very popular, and many people will flock to it as a safehaven. We read about this in the Book of Mormon, and we've seen it happen in different regions of the world already.  In summary, doctrine won't change, the church membership has always been scatter-brained, and we can predict the membership numbers will go up and down with good confidence."
lds,16s16t,benbernards,5,Thu Jan 17 22:24:09 2013 UTC,"His reasoning is that there are hundreds, thousands of people that would work just fine with each of us marriage, so it isn't that huge of a decision to make.   I completely agree. And this goes against everything I was taught, so it took me a while to come to this conclusion on my own.   My parents tell me about how they prayed about each other (after knowing each other for a short amount of time) and they were given clear answers that they were to be 'the ones' for each other.   So I assumed that's the way it happened (or should happen) for everyone.  But then what happens when people get divorced? If they were 'the ones' for each other, shouldn't they have stayed together? ...and then the whole logic of it all falls apart.  Agency is a big deal. D&C 9 tells me that God expects us to use our own brains and hearts to come to our own conclusions. And once we get an answer, we can double-check it with God to see if it was right.   Sometimes He'll say ""Yup, that's the right answer"". Sometimes He'll say ""Nope, try again...I have something better in mind for you.""  And other times He seems to say ""I'm happy if you're happy"" or ""sure, that could work for you"" or ""hey, it's your life, go live it!"". (I've experienced all of these.)  So when it comes to marriage, I think we as Mormons have quite a bit of faulty cultural programming we need to untangle, in helping people understand that there could be a lot more personal development and emotional maturity and independent thought going in to marriage decisions, as opposed to reducing it to merely a 'I prayed about it and God said yes!' type of experience."

I would have thought fasting and prayer over a period of time would be the way to decide who to marry. Granted if you were born in Provo, Utah you would have had a very different selection of men/women to choose from to if you were in Scarborough, England. That being said, despite having a different circle of potential partners, your decision to marry is a decision between you, your potential partner, and God. You are getting married in his Temple to enter the Celestrial Kingdom. To marry a person that is ""just fine"" may be a reason why a lot of people get married, but I wouldn't say it's a good one. My Dad married and divorced two women for reasons similar to she was ""just fine"".

I already told him I would not date him, so he proceeds to pine after me and eventually threaten suicide if I ever marry anyone else.   2) Boyfriend prays about whether he should marry me. He gets the answer that he should, so he proposes. Four days later God supposedly tells him ""you know, maybe you shouldn't marry her after all"" and he breaks up with me. He's now on his second marriage in three years.   My opinion is that you should never believe you're for sure meant to marry someone unless they're at least willing to go out with you, most people confuse revelation with their personal feelings, and praying about marrying someone is between you and the Lord, and you probably shouldn't tell someone ""God said we should get married"".  I never prayed about marrying my husband, but that's because I already felt at peace about it and as though I already had my answer. I feel like most people do not have one person they should marry, but if you question whether or not this is a good person to marry then by all means pray about it, I don't think our Father is above discussing any topic with those willing to ask Him."

Many, many people (ESPECIALLY young people) have trouble differentiating between emotions, attraction, hormones, excitement etc. and the spirit or a revelation. I think it can be a dangerous situation for young people when they are depending on that to make a long term, life-defining decision, but they really don't know what tools they are working with. And when you start adding on the social and ecclesiastical pressure they might feel to arrive at a certain conclusion, things can just get more sketchy.  Now, full disclosure: I'm not a TBM. But I do think that an individual can find increased clarity/revelation/whatever you want to call it by praying/meditating etc. In my experience, I just think too many young people don't really understand how that works, which might lead them to making some dangerous decisions based on some tools they really don't understand."

Prayer is, in and of itself, out way of getting direct revelation from God. He will direct us for good, he knows out hearts and kinds.   In the end, it may not 'matter' who it is that you marry, or it might. I do know that marriage is a full time job. Anyone can make it work. But, it's work."

That said, as with any major decision, one should also ""do their homework"" before the decision is made, and go to the Lord with their ducks in a row. Have an idea of what you want in your potential spouse, qualities both temporal and spiritual. There are definitely any number of people that you could build a successful, lasting relationship with out there. I do think that it takes someone special, but I don't think that there's just one person in particular.  I also don't feel that there's any need to put an amount of time as a requirement to be spent before you get married; I know people who have been married for 15-20 years who dated for a few weeks; I've known people who dated for years that are divorced. There's no catch-all here. I'd known my wife for less than a year when we were married; that was 6 years and 3 kids ago, and we're still doing fine. Making a marriage work is all about sacrifice and effort after you're married; not about the time you spent dating before you were engaged or the time you spent engaged."

Kimball's Thoughts  I know I'm a little late to the discussion, but when I got off my mission and went to BYU-I, there was an Elders quorum lesson that touched on this topic a bit. At the time we were studying from the Spencer W. Kimball manual. Here's what he said on the matter in chapter 18 just below the subtopic 'Eternal marriage requires careful preparation.':  In selecting a companion for life and for eternity, certainly the most careful planning and thinking and praying and fasting should be done to be sure that of all the decisions, this one must not be wrong. In true marriage there must be a union of minds as well as of hearts. Emotions must not wholly determine decisions, but the mind and the heart, strengthened by fasting and prayer and serious consideration, will give one a maximum chance of marital happiness. It brings with it sacrifice, sharing, and a demand for great selflessness. …  “Soul mates” are fiction and an illusion; and while every young man and young woman will seek with all diligence and prayerfulness to find a mate with whom life can be most compatible and beautiful, yet it is certain that almost any good man and any good woman can have happiness and a successful marriage if both are willing to pay the price. …  My Experience  My experience in dating and getting married was not too difficult, spiritually speaking. I dated a girl when I got home, but after a few months I was feeling very unsettled about our relationship. I loved her but couldn't ignore the fact that we desired different things out of life, and I could tell we didn't have the proper union of mind and heart.   Over the course of a few days I prayed diligently to know what to do because I felt so unsettled, but also deeply loved her. During these few days she broke it off with me first, which in a strange way was an answer to my prayers. It was sad and painful for both of us, but I'm glad we had the spiritual insight to discontinue our relationship.  After that I continued to date other girls, looking for someone who was compatible with me and could have that ""union of mind and heart"". I never really said any deeply specific prayers over the matter other than to help me find a girl and to guide my social interactions. The day before I proposed to the girl who is now my wife, I knelt in prayer and presented my decision before the Lord. I experienced very strong, peaceful feelings of approval and love, and felt great about moving forward.   I guess my experience was like it is in the Doctrine and Covenants, that we should study it out in our minds, make a decision, and then check in with Heavenly Father as to whether it's right or wrong. A huge part of the dating process, in my mind, is how we study it out in our mind."

He raised the dead and healed hundreds who were sick with malaria. It got to the point that he could hand someone his handkerchief and being touched  by it healed people.   I wonder if he would have had the faith to perform such miracles if he hadn't first endured the torments of the Liberty Jail. His experience there refined his faith and distilled his soul. He came out of that experience with greater power to follow and do God's will.

It's just attacks on anything having to do with religion.  It's not athism, it's anti-religion.  Second, avoid the NSFW.  If it's not safe for work, you can be pretty sure it's not safe for general browsing.  How to deal with trolls?  Don't.  You'll never convince them of anything and you're falling into their 'trap' by replying to them.  A troll-ignored will often leave if he isn't getting any reactions.  Not just Reddit but everything should be done in moderation.  If you suspect you're spending too much time on something, you probably are.  Find balance in work, in play, in browsing, and in posting.  Finally, use the 'mother' rule.  If it's not something you'd want your mom to see, don't post it.  I'd never be embarassed to have my mother look through my post history.  This obviously is different with different mothers...  in that case, call it the 'Bishop' rule."
lds,16qi39,tragluk,5,Thu Jan 17 08:53:34 2013 UTC,It's probably a good idea to dump all the main ones. Reddit got so much better once /politics /economics /pics /videos and /atheism etc. disapeared.  As for the NSFW stuff if you use RES you can set it to hide it all.  Also dont engage the debaters. There is absolutely nothing to gain there. It's all mud wrestling. Sure you might win but you are still covered in mud and have made a spectacle out of yourself.

lds,16qi39,DarqEgo,1 point,Thu Jan 17 20:44:15 2013 UTC,"To deal with trolls I use the 'benefit of the doubt' rule.

If they persist, they're on their own.  You can view someone's post history if you need more confirmation on who is who."
lds,16qi39,tragluk,9,Thu Jan 17 22:52:28 2013 UTC,"I loved reddit at first, and then hated it for all the reasons you posted. But I still loved it... what is a TBM to do? (those who know me know that they should buckle up for an incoming tidal wave of text)  The content here is amazing, but it is also horrible. The people here are amazing, but some are downright awful. I have seen things that have made me cry in both good and bad ways. Things that have enlivened my soul and things that made me feel dead inside.  The reason I haven't left reddit is the former outweighs, however much, the latter. There is so much good that it has been worth it so far to endure some of the bad.   Reddit is the most current, cutting edge conversation on the web. This is the beachhead to the frontier, the first stop before the future. Stuff happens here! It is important, I think, that members of the church are here. It is so refreshing to see posts where people mock our church or its members... and we show up in mass to correct, to inform, to upvote/downvote appropriately and crack a few jokes ourselves. We belong here, and can do much good in helping the reputation of the church.  So in order to understand your relationship with Reddit, you need to understand Reddit's true nature.  Reddit is not a community. It is not.  It is a community of communities. Many of these bleed together into a hive mind, sure, but you simply can't afford to be a part of hive.  The reason that I eventually got an account and upgraded from lurker status was because /atheism was giving me the testimony blues. I got through my crisis of faith... and after I did, I saw the atheism subreddit for what it is (and what others have called it in this thread): anti-religious. There is very few constructive arguments, mostly ""religious people are stupid."" It was grating.    And so was the nsfw content. I remember this saying from my youth: ""People think that we abstain from drugs, alcohol, and sex because we are better than them. We do it because we are not."" We aren't better than anyone out there. Leave a person alone in a room with a NSFW link... and, very little good will come of it. Okay, none. :)  Step one, go to your settings and hide NSFW posts. Google how to do this. Or get RES, as has been suggested.  So step two, get an account (for you lurkers) and unsub from a couple of the default subreddits. Many of those have already been listed in this thread.  Step three, sub to specific subreddits on topics that you are interested in and like. Smaller subreddits are the key to enjoying reddit. They usually have great discussions, are more moderated (because they are manageable) and you are already interested in them. It is a great, passive, way to bring good content to you based on your interests and what you want to learn more about. Reddit became so much better when i started posting in /r/lds.  Step four- careful on the debates you have with people. If you do debate, be absolutely prepared to not have the last word. State your thoughts, feelings, and facts with confidence and be done with it.  Step five- ignore trolls. If Christ were on reddit, he'd cast the demon trolls into a bunch of cats and have them run off the side of a cliff into the sea. Two birds with one stone.   Step six- Be yourself. Post things you know are unpopular. Don't buy into upvotes and downvotes as a way of assessing what is right and wrong, only what is popular and unpopular. The way of the Mormon in this life is not easy anyways. Don't embrace persecution, just live your life in such a way that it doesn't factor into your decision making.  I love local subreddits, /r/scuba, /r/sailing, /r/conservative (hit and miss here) /r/airsoft, /r/guitar, /r/DIY, and of a number of fitness subreddits and specific nerdy subreddits for tvshows and movies I like. My fave is /r/askhistorians, but like everything on the internet... do your own research and form your own opinion. Good luck out there!"

lds,16qi39,Obj_solid,7,Thu Jan 17 06:34:29 2013 UTC,Obj_solid knows what they are talking about.   I would also recommend unsubbing from any subreddit that you do not actively peruse. Find subreddits that meet your hobbies and interests. If you are still subscribed to the default subreddits you are doing it wrong.   For every default subreddit there is a much more informative similar subreddit.

lds,16qi39,AKA_Braeburn,7,Thu Jan 17 19:47:32 2013 UTC,"I would have left reddit long ago if I weren't able to customize my experience. As of now I don't think I have any of the default subreddits. Instead I susbscribe to those which are related to my work and interests. So, as an insurance agent, I moderate over at /r/insurance. I also subscribe to /r/personalfinance and sometimes /r/investing and /r/entrepreneur. I also subscribe to /r/marketing and /r/seo to help me do better at my work. I also enjoy writing so I subscribe to /r/books /r/write /r/writing /r/writingprompts and a number of private subreddits dedicated to helping people improve their writing or getting published, etc. For my other interests I have /r/askhistorians and /r/talesfromtechsupport /r/android /r/geek /r/news. Then, there's obviously /r/lds.   Keeping my subreddits limited to the ""boring but relevant"" stuff keeps me from spending too much time. Smaller subs aren't as constantly updating as the large ones, so checking once a day is plenty.   One of the best decisions I made was to get into the scriptures when participating in the religious parts of reddit. I would go to /r/debateachristian or /r/debatereligion and look for a discussion which I found interesting and to which I thought the mormon perspective would provide added insight. I then went to the scriptures and found my resources. It meant spending perhaps half an hour every day studying topics like the plan of salvation or the atonement, then writing out what I learned in an orderly way. (Of course, the OP has no interest in being wrong, so they would often choose to disregard or attack the mormon perspective, but I'm fine walking away from that sort of thing.

Here's why: 1. Opposition in all things. Reddit is ideas/opinions/commentary from fellow brothers/sisters. Yes, there is plenty of stupid trollishness at every turn...but too, there is reasoned and thoughtful insight from ppl I ordinarily would never encounter or listen too. It gives me the intellectual nudge to ask, ""Well gosh, I never looked at it that way. Why not?""   Reality check. My pleasant world view isn't necessarily the most correct (though it's comforting to think I've got it all figured out). Reddits can be provocative, forcing me to reevaluate cherished notions. Ever wonder what's ""wrong"" with gay ppl? Abortion? Welfare? Islam? Check out their subs. It may promote better understanding. Freedom. The cacophony of humanity (as seen on reddit) is fascinating. The glory of God is intelligence. This idea is debatable: That, keeping only a narrow focus on pet issues may keep one from comprehending the bigger picture.   Nothing wrong with exposing yourself only to circumspect and uplifting sources which only reinforce already held beliefs...but I personally prefer to not feel so isolated in my world view...not that reddit is the holy grail of knowledge (!); but it can certainly be distracting.   For efficiency sake, as others have already said here: you have lots if control over your reddit experience."

Another common word that most people won't bat an eye at is ""suck"" yet the only origin of that word in its derogatory sense that I've heard has disgusting imagery and I would not want to apply it to anyone.  Relating to our language and the authority to speak what we say:   61 Wherefore, let all men beware how they take my name in their lips—  62 For behold, verily I say, that many there be who are under this condemnation, who use the name of the Lord, and use it in vain, having not authority. D&C 63:61-62   That our focus should be on uplifting language:   Instead of using profane speech, Latter-day Saints should ""enlighten, edify, lift, motivate, elevate, build and uplift"" others through their words (Brewerton, p. 73). By doing so, they will not forfeit the multitude of blessings promised them if they ""bridle [their] tongues""    Profanity in the Encyclopedia of Mormonism   The nearer we get to God, the more easily our spirits are touched by refined and beautiful things. God speaks all languages, and He speaks them properly. He is restrained and modest of speech. When God described the grand creational process of this earth, He said in measured tones that “it was good” (Genesis 1:4). We would be disappointed if God had used “awesome” or other exaggerated phrases.   Our Refined Heavenly Home   Clean and intelligent language is evidence of a bright and wholesome mind.

This means more tithing money for the church, which means profits in another way. Also, this means more tourists, which means more converts.(actually, the real reason it was even constructed was to make Salt Lake a better place for tourists, with the idea being that the more tourists salt lake gets, the more converts it will also get.)  Also, the money used to fund it came from the for profit arm of the church. Which means that no humanitarian aid money and no tithing was used to build it. Only money gained from the church's investments.  In short, it brings more money and tourists to Utah, which helps the Church through tithing and converts."
lds,16nbna,POOR_IMPULSE_CONTR0L,-3,Wed Jan 16 01:16:05 2013 UTC,"No citation is needed to prove it helped the Utah economy. Since opening the stores have been selling like crazy and the mall is always packed. My source for that is that I live one street away from it and I go to the Gym there nearly every day. The Church makes a cut of all the profits made at the mall, so the more packed it is, the more money they make.  Furthermore, the mall makes salt lake a more desirable place to live. This will cause more people to move to salt lake, which will bring more businesses, more industry, etc. All of that creates more jobs for Utah Mormons and in turn generates more tithing.  You also have to realize that it is unlikely that the Church actually spent 1.5 billion on the project. They likely used financial leverage. In other words, they probably put in about 150 million and got a big loan from a bank for the rest. The reason for that is that a very common real estate strategy for huge projects like this is to get a loan where the payment is less than the rental income. Because that way you minimize your burden of the risk. If the project goes south, you're only out 150 million, and the rest is on the bank's shoulders. A loan like that is basically investment insurance. And furthermore, doing this gets your money back to you faster. Because, you see, no matter the loan size, the church will pay a set payment that is a percentage of the loan principle. But if they want they could charge their customers a percentage of the profits, and monthly rent. Which could end in the church earning several times more per month than they pay in interest payments. But having gotten a loan they can build a bigger sexier mall than would have been possible with their own money. Becuase its a much better mall it will attract much higher paying clientele. In other words, not only do they have less risk by financing a lot of it, but they also build a bigger mall, which ends in more net profits for them.  Furthermore, due to government subsidies for sustainable community housing, it is very likely that the Church got a huuuge government subsidy to build this project. Which they could have used to get the loan from the bank. (there are apartments above the mall). Tons of apartments were built above the nearby Gateway mall that Romney built for the same reason. The government subsidies that exist for community housing are for the purpose of preserving the environment by getting people to live in more dense areas where they rarely need to use cars. Since it's an environmental thing, the amount of money in subsidies the government is currently throwing out to such projects is obscene. In other words, its possible that they got 100 million in grants from the government, slapped 50 million of their own money onto that, then used their amazing credit rating to get a 10 to 1 loan ratio and financed the rest of the 1.35 billion from a bank.  There are 100 stores there, the church is going to make quite a lot of money off of that in rent. I would wager to say that they will make more than $15 million a year, which means that they will make back their initial investment in about 10 years assuming they didn't use the government subsidy towards the loan collateral or assuming that it wasn't really that big a subsidy. But my assumption is actually pretty low given that there are 100 stores there and those stores are all stores for rich people, like Hugo Boss and Nordstroms and Restoration Hardware. For all we know, they could be making 20 or 30 million a year off it. For all we know, they could make their actual cash investment back in as little as 5 years time. And then 5 years after that, they would have doubled their initial cash investment.  I am just assuming all of this, but given the fact that the church employs some of the most crack real estate businessmen out there to take care of its deals, I'm pretty confident this estimate is actually lower than the truth.  All of this is beside the point though. Do you, or do you not believe that the leaders of the Church are inspired by God? If you do, then even if they build a strip club with the money, you have to believe that it is the right thing, because you believe that they are inspired.  If you don't believe that they are inspired, then you don't really have a testimony and maybe you should do some personal introspection and prayer."

It is not in the mind of God. If I were to attempt that, the Lord would remove me out of my place, and so He will any other man who attempts to lead the children of men astray from the oracles of God and from their duty.""

lds,16nbna,jessemb,1 point,Thu Jan 17 23:07:50 2013 UTC,"Great, but that still doesn't justify you not liking the mall. Ask anyone in real estate, that was about as riskless and profitable a deal as you could possibly ask for. Literally, the Church could not have invested that money in something better than they did. What did you want it to stay in a bank account where inflation would devalue it constantly?  When you have really large sums of money, if you don't invest them, you are constantly hemorrhaging money due to inflation. (you have the same number of dollars, but they are constantly worth less). In order to merely maintain your wealth, you have to invest in something with a higher rate of return than inflation. Currently that would mean that whatever you  keep your money in would have to have a return rate higher than 2% for you to at least maintain your  money. With how much money they have, they might be able to get a savings account that yielded slightly more than inflation. But if they put that money into any sort of mutual fund they would be risking SO MUCH. The national economy is a lot more volatile and far more risky than the local economy of Utah. I would far prefer they put the money into something local, and stable, than to leave it out to be ravaged by the financial disasters on the horizon. I mean, it's not even a question anymore of if the national economy will collapse again. It's just a question of whether people can keep it together until the end of Obama's term, or whether he will still be in office when our country dives off a cliff.  Personally, if the Church didn't invest their money, I would be pissed. What are we the members supposed to pay for everything when they could easily put the money they already have to work and make more with it? Screw that.  Honestly, if you aren't really involved in the investment world you probably shouldn't even be passing judgement regarding what the Church does with it's finances because you have no expertise with which to judge."

City Creek Center is gorgeous, and it makes Temple Square a nicer place.  I've never been to a more beautiful shopping area.  Most of the shops are out of my price range--but I love buying little fizzy bath soaps for my wife from the little fizzy bath soap place.  (I'm a dude, so I can't remember what the store is called.)  Personally, I remember some parable or other, can't remember who told it, but it was about three guys who were given a lot of money, and two of them went out and invested it, and the Lord was pretty pleased with that.  I don't really care about the financial aspect.  I just know that the Church created a whole lot of jobs during a recession, and they made something beautiful at the same time."

I'm not judging you if you have doubts, I am just pointing out that if you don't fully support the Church leaders then there is a fundamental flaw in your testimony. There is nothing wrong with that, but if you don't get it fixed it might end in you leaving the church. I don't know why you would think that I am judging you, you don't even know me. My best friend in the world is my brother, and he has tried his whole life to believe in the church, and he just finds that he can't. That doesn't make him less of a person and I love him just as much as I would if he had a testimony, and having doubts doesn't make you less of a person either.  But more than everything, calm down bro, it's gonna be ok. First off, I have met very few ex mormons that hate mormonism or mormons. And those that do don't hate mormons because of anything that Mormons do. The ones that I have met who hate mormonism seem to hate it because its the only way they can avoid their guilt. They take an emotion that is more energetically charged than their guilt, such as anger, and use that to mask their own feeling. It is a way they lie to themselves.

That's why churches are given the tax exemption, because they are supposed to help provide services for the public that the government can't or doesn't.   I think that's why Jesus started the church, to help people.  Not to make money and become more wealthy.  The book of mormon warns of this many times."

And I would believe it if we could look back and see the church doing more and more in regards to humanitarian aid each year but we don't.   They do a lot, don't get me wrong but compared to what they COULD do they are not even close.  The church IS and has been for a long time financially independent.  They are VERY, VERY wealthy and have the means to do so much more good than they do.   Of all the things the Lord could have told President Hinckley to do, he told him to build the most expensive mall in the United States?  Really?"
lds,16nbna,KADWC1016,-3,Wed Jan 16 03:17:16 2013 UTC,Are you one of the Mormons that thinks that tithing dollars were used to build this mall?
lds,16nbna,sickyd,8,Wed Jan 16 18:47:42 2013 UTC,"To answer your first question, you're right. The money could have been used for other things. All the money could have been used for disaster relief, or for inoculations in Africa, or tons of other humanitarian aid things. But, the Church obviously sees this as an investment to not only grow the money that it has available to it to do future good things, but to also make downtown SLC a better destination area, further enriching the environment around Temple Square. Basically, there is no way to make money in pure humanitarian aid. Building a nice mall near Temple Square not only beautifies the area, but also allows the Church to make more money to do better things in the future.  As for the second question, The Presiding Bishopric manages a corporation called The Corporation of the President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (or something similar). This for-profit organization engages in various commercial activities throughout the US, including the City Creek Mall. Since it is a private corporation, it does not need to make its financial documents available to the public, unlike a public corporation. But this corporation most definitely pays federal and state taxes and follows all the rules that any business must follow. Many people, including church members, do not understand that when you give tithing, you are making a donation to the non-profit arm of the Church. There is not some ginormous slush fund where all the money goes."
lds,16nbna,sickyd,4,Wed Jan 16 19:18:01 2013 UTC,"As far as I know, ZCMI was the first church-owned business.  It seems as though Brigham Young felt the need for a church-run store, and he and other church members pooled their resources to start it up.  I imagine any other money would have had to come in a similar way.  And if that wasn't the case, and the business arm was getting money from the non-profit arm, then the IRS would be all over that.   If we are so worried about beautification, we could have built a park.   Although not technically a park, but are we forgetting about the Main Street Plaza?  Also filled with controversy.   Or expanded humanitarian square.   They did that a decade ago, too.   Or opened a heavily-subsidized trade school, catering to the poor.   Because the Perpetual Education Fund isn't enough?  Sorry, I don't mean to give you a hard time-- you aren't the only Mormon that thinks building a mall was a bad idea, or that the money could have been better used elsewhere.  But the fact is, millions of dollars are being used elsewhere.  We just don't see it as easily as a giant mall.  But you know what?  Maybe we should spend more on humanitarian aid.  I'll do my part and increase my donations to those other funds."
lds,16nbna,WooperSlim,6,Wed Jan 16 19:24:31 2013 UTC,"millions of dollars are being used elsewhere.    But when the Church wastes 3 BILLION (not the projected 1.5 Billion) dollars that is a concern. There are people that are homeless, or starving IN THIS COUNTRY. Right here under the shadow of the Temple. Yes the church does help, but how much help do you think 3 billion could have brought? Hell they could have built a home for every person in SLC that is homeless and still come out with money. They could have funded a low income apartment and still had money left. instead they choose to fund Rolex, Tiffanys, and other high end merchants, most of which over half if not more of the people in the valley could not even afford to shop at! This is a waste of money, no matter where the money came from."
lds,16nbna,titanicx,3,Wed Jan 16 20:00:05 2013 UTC,"Not that $1.5 Billion isn't a lot, but who's reporting $3 Billion?  Yes, $3 Billion could have built houses for the homeless.  Then there would be people that would complain about that.  I complain about Google spending $5.5 Billion to buy patents, but they clearly saw it as a money-saving investment.  Just because we don't like how the money is being spent doesn't mean it's wasted.  The City Creek Center does a lot of good -- you already mentioned the high-end shopping, this will boost the economy.  It also created a lot of jobs in the retail and office spaces.  Also includes condos and apartments.  Sounds like a much better deal than the church's last downtown beautification project.  Maybe I'm wrong, but I would think the best way to help the homeless is to give them jobs.  But I suppose if we can house the homeless, why not?  The Road Home just joined the national 100,000 Homes campaign to move the nation's most vulnerable into permanent homes.  LDS Humanitarian Services is one of many contributors to this.  But you already said you know the church helps; you just wish they would help differently.  Well... I guess it's impossible to make everyone happy."
lds,16nbna,WooperSlim,0,Wed Jan 16 02:36:51 2013 UTC,"It's been reported between 1.5 and 5 billion dollars depending on the news agency, unfortunately because of the nature of the funding they won't release a total number. Malls do not really boost the economy. As has been pointed out by many here. This is a fallacy that many supporters of this mall try to throw out there. Jobs are a great start, however, if a person has no place to stay they have no real way of getting a job, no way of cleaning clothes, of showering, etc. I know very well how much the church helps and I am not denying it. But I am saying that they do waste money as well. Just because they are the church doesn't mean that they are infallible. Even in Joseph Smiths time he had failed ventures. These are mans dealings and decisions, not holy dealings.   Edit: I love down votes with out context.

And actually, I think this is the best argument against the City Creek Mall:  It would do us all well to remember how well the Kirtland Safety Society turned out.  But hopefully the members and leaders have learned since then.  (I can imagine the reaction if President Monson said, ""I am pleased to announce that the Church will be building a state-of-the art shopping center.  Please consider donating to the Perpetual Mall Building fund."")  I think what you said is also the reason I'm not upset about the excessive cost of the mall:  ""These are man's dealings and decisions, not holy dealings.""  But I like looking for justifications anyway.  :)  As for the cost, I remember that when it opened up, Deseret News cited $1.5 Billion and the Salt Lake Tribune cited $2 Billion, and it was only KSL that said $5 Billion.  Based on the wording, I think the $5 Billion is referring to the entire downtown revitalization effort, of which the City Creek Center is just a part."

But, as far as I can tell, the Church is doing everything correctly.  2: I think there is a difference. As members we have a certain idea of what tithing should be used for. I definitely think it would be inappropriate for the Church to use member tithing and donations on things like City Creek. But at the same time, I see the commercial funds of the Church as a way for the Church to not only have a sort of financial security, but also to help others in indirect ways.  Like I said before, pure humanitarian aid is not profitable. It is a sunk cost. Does it help people? Yes. Does it allow the Church to help anyone else in the future? No. All your suggestions are great for now, but what about 10 years from now when that trade school runs out of money? What about when the park runs out of funds for upkeep and the city refuses to do anything?  If we were to do as the Savior said literally, the Church would have been broke long ago."

It is my personal belief that tithing and fast offerings help the giver 100 times more than they do the receiver of the funds. As far as making some sort of profit, it provides greater ability to help those in the future. I'm not saying aid is not an important priority. But I would rather have the resources to moderately help others over time than to give it all away. And yes, I do think Jesus was not speaking literally. If so, we would all be homeless following a homeless prophet around America. I DO think that Jesus meant that we should not set our heart on riches or things of the world, but to follow him and set our heart on his teachings. You will likely retort that a mall is exactly the sort of ""riches"" the Savior was talking about. On this we must differ, because whereas you see City Creek as a waste of space and a money hole, I see it as a way to buoy the SLC economy, give many people jobs, and also provide a nice destination for those that are visiting SLC."

For a global organization, doesn't all this emphasis on SLC, which already had two malls downtown, with one of the three doomed to failure, have other better things it could have done?

Somewhere around this time, the books were closed, but it is generally understood that President Tanner was very successful at changing the church's budget and investment strategies.

If you consider any dollar generated by any venture or activity administrated by the Church to only be used to build churches and temples, then yes there is an issue with City Creek. However I see the commercially generated funds as an opportunity for the Church to be a part of the communities it is in and positively contribute to the economy, while tithing is directly used for Church-specific tasks."
lds,16nbna,sickyd,14,Wed Jan 16 17:34:31 2013 UTC,"They all started as tithing money, if you really think about it."
lds,16nbna,lebruf,3,Wed Jan 16 20:34:36 2013 UTC,Not necessarily. Some things started as general donations. Some things started as the church telling a guy to set up a store in an area during the colonization of the Utah area to give the local settlers access to goods coming in fromthe outside. The church was very involved with the temporal affairs of the area i nthe beginning. I imagine a lot of the money comes fro mventures that were started during that time.
lds,16nbna,theCroc,6,Wed Jan 16 17:20:06 2013 UTC,"The truth is, as there is no transparency you have no basis to claim zero tithing dollars were used, and the idea that the only business investments are from funds given 100 years ago is something two seconds worth of thought should dispel. From the anecdotal reports, it seems they keep the money sitting in limbo for 3 years earning interest before they spend it, and consider the interest on the lord's funds ""non-tithing."" What was that thing about usury in the bible?"

lds,16nbna,lanfearl,1 point,Wed Jan 16 03:56:52 2013 UTC,"You are arguing semantics.  The entire church was built on the dedication, sweat, and tithing of the original members. The Book of Mormon was printed with tithing donations from one member.  It's all tithing."
lds,16nbna,sickyd,2,Wed Jan 16 04:05:34 2013 UTC,"So since everything the Church has is ""tithing"", what is an appropriate use for these funds? Besides City Creek the Church engages in cattle ranching, the PCC, which is essentially a Hawaiian theme park, and a lot of other commercial ventures.

lds,16nbna,lanfearl,1 point,Wed Jan 16 04:53:05 2013 UTC,"I'm suggesting that the church should be donating more, and spending less.

Spike up the economy, and the overall wealth of the area increases,and business increases.  Better economy means less poverty.

Just because you're rich doesn't mean you will spend all of your money at some rich mall. I know plenty of rich people who shop at Ross! This mall gave a lot of people jobs and in the part of downtown that really needs them.

Sure, it is about economic development, but this misses the big plan.  What is the big plan?  Utah is determined to become a center for business.  The Governor, Legislature, local businesses, and the church are all working together to attract big businesses to Utah.  Take Goldman Sachs.  The legislature pulled some strings to bring them here.  In return Goldman agreed to pay its employees 40% more than the median wage in Utah.  Citycreek is only a small part of this strategy.  In order to attract these businesses, you need to provide the urban environment they are used to.  Think of life in places like New York City.  That's why citycreek wasn't just a mall.  It also includes condos, apartments, nice restaurants, and even a gym.  It's also why they built places like the 222 south main office tower, or why there is a sudden push/realization that nightlife in Salt Lake needs to improve.  It's all too convince big companies like Goldman that Utah is a great place to be."

But for serious work to be done, we need theologians.   What do you think of the state of LDS theology? Could we use more systematic theology? Less?  When I think of LDS theologies, I primarily think of Talmage and McConkie--and those two have each had significant impact on what the average church member thinks and believes, even today. I think that it's good that we have those voices, but it would be better if we had more voices on the subject."
lds,16n2c0,panserbjorner,2,Tue Jan 15 21:13:28 2013 UTC,I think Mormon theology is about to become really obvious and impressive.

If the prophets and apostles are not theologians, what is their use? Why sustain them as prophets, apostles, seers and revelators if the only function is inspired administrators? You can see that members are starving for the revealed word of God when they go to GC and any event that they show up for.  When the Church claims that there is an absolute truth, then it is perfectly fair to require the Church to define that absolute truth. And when the Church claims that there are people who speak and talk to God, it perfectly reasonable to expect that God could reveal that absolute truth in plain English.   The article was dead on one aspect: the Church has moved from what you believe and what the truth is, to obiedience. And what is so disturbing is that as the McConkie and Talmage theologies fade into history, the reason why the Church standards, rules, policies and ordiances exist will fade. That's scary."

To say that every member must dig, hunt, and discern from the standard works and from what little the prophets teach, and/or get the truth reveleaved is to setup for a system where every member believes something different and a good number of them will believe and teach damnable heresy.   That sounds a lot like what we see. You have a lot of people agreeing on basics, but beyond that there are many opinions. You have liberal heresies, and conservative heresies.

If the prophets and apostles are not theologians, what is their use?   They're... not theologians. They teach the gospel, but they don't set out to define it in its entirety.

It's just not what I see happening. When President Hinckley described revelation, he described inspiration for administrative problems. They claim inspiration when writing talks (which members often call scripture), but I've never in my life heard any claim that a particular message was the result of direct revelation. I think that many believe that, by virtue of their calling, everything they do is exactly what God told them to do. I don't think that's true.  Here's why I say that they're not theologians: they say things like ""Jesus Christ suffered in Gethsemane to save us from sin"" and not things like ""the LDS conception of the atonement is similar to Anselm's Satisfaction Theory of Atonement in several ways. Specifically..."" They're stating basic principles, but generally not trying to describe why, how, or give context on why we believe the things we do and how/whether that belief has shifted. Unpopular ideas aren't rejected or justified, they're ""forgotten"".  Serious theology is a fairly academic pursuit, and I don't expect that they even have much time for it given their extremely busy schedules administrating the church and flying all over the place giving devotional speeches.  What you're asking for isn't even a theologian. You're asking for a prophet. Even Joseph Smith, with all the answers he gave, never sat down and wrote a catechism, let alone a Summa Theologica.

lds,16n2c0,todaywasawesome,4,Wed Jan 16 22:48:07 2013 UTC,I think we're unlikely to see more definition of theology. It's viewed as politically untenable by the leadership of the church. Instead we've agreed on the democratization of doctrine (which is good and bad). Everyone is invited to ponder and search the depths of doctrine with equal right to revelation.  It lines up nicely with a story about this years study target: President Lorenzo Snow. He learned about the doctrine of eternal progression well before the King Follet discourse. check it

""While fundamentalism continues to be the predominant doctrinal philosophy of most Latter-day Saints, perhaps the most significant development of the past decade has been the gradual erasing of Bruce McConkie’s influence on doctrine.""   What is the common view on McConkie? As a member of the twelve, I would have thought his views held some authority, if not divine. I saw in another thread a user quoted him; to paraphrase in 1984 he states ""... Job is for Job, and the Songs of Solomon are biblical trash ..."" Is this a widely held notion within the LDS church?   ""... the weaknesses or difficulties of our doctrines (which are often a mess) ...""   What weaknesses/difficulties? How might they be different from protestant and Catholic doctrines?   ""The simplest answer to why there is so little Mormon theology is that there are no Mormon theologians.

But for serious work to be done, we need theologians. There are no Mormon theologians because there is no institution to produce them. There are no LDS seminaries (in the standard use of that term, institutions giving postgraduate education to students of religion, often those intending a career in the ministry). There is no professionally trained LDS clergy, even at the highest levels. LDS universities do not sponsor chairs of theology; they don’t even offer courses in theology.""   I find this shocking! Although upon reflection, understandable. One of the primary attitudes in Mormon theology, I feel, is a separation from incorrect theologies that the mainstream church(es) have produced over the centuries. As with all human enterprises: with time comes reflection, adjustment, and the decision to remain or change. Theologians aid the reflection period which leads to change, a criticism of Mormonism on the mainstream churches. As a relatively young denomination that did not take much quantity from older denominations (e.g. the Methodist denomination being a branch off from the Anglican denominations), how many decades or centuries will the LDS church keep the same doctrines and stances.   One might think that theology is a consistent body of fact and theory that grows over time, with the current generation building on the work of preceding generations of theologians and the overall body of theology (or a particular denomination’s theology) becoming an increasingly accurate model of the phenomena that theology attempts to explain. Familiar terms like christology, ecclesiology, and soteriology would be chapters in this growing tome of Christian theology or, in our case, LDS theology. The first reason to reject this view is that systematic theologies are generally produced by individual theologians, not by denominations, and each systematic theologian differs from the other on certain issues, even if they work from within the same tradition.   It is important to note as well that publications by so-called theologians (however an ambiguous title that is! Is a child who wonders what the face of God looks like anymore a theologian than an aged academic?) are reactions from previous publications. It is a conversation throughout time and history, discussing the facts about an issue ultimately unknowable. A Catholic Priests opinions on the Gospel's reaction to the financial crisis in Greece might be different from an Anglican Ministers opinions on the same subject. I suspect the same is true for particular theologies that the Christian world has been concerned with since the start of the Church.   ""If you are strolling down the aisle at your favorite bookstore and come across a very thick book titled “A Systematic Theology of Mormonism,” and see those familiar topics in the chapter titles, you know what game’s afoot. You may not agree with the author’s arguments or claims, but that’s theology. Then you come across a thin book titled “Selected Essays on Various Theological Topics That Might (or Might Not) Answer a Question or Two You Have About God and Life.” Essays, rather idiosyncratic, some interesting, even helpful on this or that issue … but, you might say, it’s not really theology, at least the sort of Theology with a big T that is offered by the first book. The point of the above critique is that there is no Theology with a big T: the best we can do is theology with a little t, even if it is presented systematically.""   True. My point in the above paragraph.   ""If theology were a machine, it would not be a perfect machine, one that can do any and every task. That doesn’t even make sense — machines do specific tasks or a narrow range of tasks. There is no everything machine, just like there is no everything theology. If theology were a machine, it would be a Rube Goldberg machine. Theology takes the tools, ideas, and materials at hand and constructs something to deal with a specific, relevant theological problem. If a poem solves your theological problem and lets you sleep at night, that’s theology.  Perhaps I’m claiming a bit more for theology than Adam, but he voices similar observations in the book’s Introduction. “Theology, maybe especially Mormon theology, requires this kind of modesty. … It is painful to watch a theologian who thinks he’s finally bolted together ‘the one true Rube Goldberg Machine.’” He describes the theologian as an “imaginative tinkerer” and theology as an activity that “makes the familiar strange.” ""   An interesting analogy, and one I am hesitant to accept for no other reason than it is odd! It would be difficult to accept the works of Thomas Aquinas as modest. This again shows a difference between mainstream Christian attitudes and thinking, and Mormonism.   ""Bad theology can contribute to human suffering. People take religion seriously, and bad theology can contribute to deep personal angst, even sometimes to the bitter end of taking one’s own life. Good theology can prevent or remedy some of that suffering. Good theology can put the hope back in faith, hope, and charity.""   Good point. I suspect all Theology is meant to be for the cause of the latter and not the former. I remember one time when I first became a Christian that never got naked (not even in the shower) because I thought it was a sin!   Lastly, as I mentioned previously, I feel that the LDS church is a young and growing church that is expanding in a variety of ways to accommodate the modern world. I feel that the attitude towards Theology in a new and groundbreaking religion such as Christianity garnered much debate and interest among the emerging churches in Europe and Asia-Minor, at the turning point of the common era. The attitude towards Theology in a new and groundbreaking *denomination such as the Latter-Day Saint movement would have been entirely different in an emerging America in the nineteenth century, which I assume valued different qualities in religion."

The wife is to observe her husband's authority and both are to observe the ""traditional"" (aka doctrinal) gender roles which the Lord has laid out.  There are real, important differences between the sexes. The Lord knows this and made people that way. He has told us what each sex was meant to do. These aren't flexible roles, they aren't merely traditional roles, they are definite and doctrinal roles. I suggest you stop rebelling against them, stop following the evil way, and come back into compliance with the gospel in humility and repentance."

We should not judge one another on this matter.   Their readiness is for them to decide, and not for you to condemn.  Also, why does speaking order in Sacrament meeting have anything to do with authority? It's a custom to have the man speak second, but there's no doctrinal basis to that practice.

It should be ""we have prayed about it and don't feel like it's the right time"". The rule isn't to have huge families with 10-20 children, it's to exercise faith and pray to for inspiration when planning a family.  You say there are rules. Would you mind expounding on this? What is the minimum number of children that a fertile couple should have? How soon after marriage should they start having children? How should they determine their fitness to raise a certain number of children? What are the valid reasons for postponing marriage or children? Do income, physical health, or mental state have any bearing on any of the questions? If, for any reason, they have determined that they can't provide for (emotionally or physically) additional children, is it permissible to use birth control? What if the previous pregnancy was difficult, and the mother would like more than 6 months to recover, is birth control then permissible? If number and timing is between the man, the woman, and the Lord, then why would birth control be considered improper as long as the man and woman are prayerfully deciding when to have children?"

(Joseph Smith)   It is much more difficult for wives to learn than it is for husbands, because women have not the degree of light and knowledge that their husbands have; they have not the power over their passions that their husbands have: therefore, they have to suffer one for another until they get power over themselves like unto those that have advanced more fully in the knowledge of our God.

First (and primarily), it's the moderately creepy nature of ""specifically ensure recognizes my right"". What does he do if she asks someone to pray instead of him? And who ""specifically ensures"" that her rights are respected?  Second, it's the fact that picking who prays at a meal or family prayer isn't a sacred priesthood duty that can only be done by the priesthood holder in the home. The wife picking who prays isn't an ""emasculation"" of the husband, and a couple coming to an agreement on who picks or prays most of the time is seriously not a doctrinal issue."

I vaguely recall seeing data to verify the claim. Since then I've watched traffic rankings on alexa.com and other search engine analytics sites to see how things have changed; the top 25 most visited sites in the US are the major portals, ecommerce, and social media sites...not genealogy.   The most frequently visited genealogy site, ancestry.com, is ranked #662 in frequency. Familysearch.org is #4,982  . Porn sites, on the other hand, start appearing in the top 50.  The query string 'genealogy' itself appears to be in the low 20th percentile of popularity.  So, no, the world isn't searching for genealogy as much as we thought they were. It's still an important topic and a worthy cause to pursue, but the data don't justify us trumpeting our horns as much as we were. :-)  (I also noticed that the Bloomberg article didn't have any sources to back up their claims. )"

Pew Research did a survey and asked what people did on the internet. Genealogy was far down on the list, with only 27% responding to this activity as something they did. Porn was not listed in this, though I'm not surprised, as this was a survey, and not actual raw data. The Huffington Post has a fairly interesting infographic, but again, Genealogy and Pornography do not come up in what is used. Unsurprisingly, the largest use of internet comes in social media, or dealing with other people, through E-mail or other services. Followed usually by improvement, troubleshooting, and news. Entertainment is towards the low end of things, but higher still than genealogy, or pornography, though I suppose people could count both activities as entertainment.

Genealogy is a big important topic for many church members. I don't know where else this 'factoid' would be brought up, or where else this question might be relevant. Probably the same for the OP. Just seemed natural to post here.  Genealogy is discussed among members because it aligns with the central doctrines of the church, mainly temples, eternal families, and providing gospel ordinances of salvation to all of God's children. To 'seal' families together for eternity we search out our ancestors and perform the ordinances in their behalf. Like baptism for the dead. There are other ordinances like sealing of families, and husbands and wives. That is where the idea of eternal marriage comes from. The point is that sealing families and relationships here in temples with proper priesthood authority will have the bond recognized in heaven and earth, just like baptism done with the proper priesthood authority.  http://www.lds.org/topics/family-history/purpose-family-history-work?lang=eng"

lds,16krhl,Haephestus,3,Tue Jan 15 04:00:42 2013 UTC,"The Wikipedia article has some speculations on doctrinal significance. To summarize what I read, some people think Solomon may have written it, while others say that it was for him.  I guess a lot of people explain its inclusion as a piece of allegory, or that it symbolically represents the relationship God has with the church (get it? love and stuff?).   The section marked ""other considerations"" reads: ""The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the largest denomination in the Latter Day Saint movement, does not recognize the book as ""inspired scripture,"" although it is included in the church's canon and printed in church-published copies of the Bible.""  I seem to understand that there has been a lot of debate on the inclusion of specific books of the Bible. For example, we know of the Apocrypha: some of which is contained in the traditional Catholic bible, but deemed ""non-doctrinal"" by a lot of the Protestant reformers. I think a lot of the early reformers voted on which books to keep. I bet they decided to keep Song of Solomon because they liked it and thought it was pretty."
lds,16krhl,amertune,1 point,Tue Jan 15 00:36:18 2013 UTC,"The Apocrypha was included in the Septuagint (Greek translation of the Old Testament) but not the Masoretic text (Hebrew version of the Old Testament). That is the primary reason that the Apocrypha was considered suspect, and why it's been generally dropped from Protestant bibles since the early 19th century.   I think a lot of the early reformers voted on which books to keep.   Other than the Apocrypha, which has always had a somewhat suspect status, the voting on which books to keep had ceased about 1200 years before the Reformation started. Martin Luther also suspected Jude, James, Hebrews, and Revelation, but there weren't any serious attempts that I know of to change the Bible canon."

Actually, I find it quite beautiful. We use the allegory of Christ as the bridegroom and the Church as the bride quite frequently, so I don't see why SoS is such a stretch. I think the discomfort with it stems from our rather puritanical attitudes about sex rather than the content itself.   Certainly, it's inappropriate for certain situations, but I don't think that renders it invalid. And just because it isn't ""inspired scripture"" doesn't mean that it's worthless either."

I have long held that Job is largely a work of literature and was never meant as a historical book. That being said, it has surprising spiritual insights, including the verse that says ""I know that my Redeemer liveth,"" indicating the author had some knowledge of Christ (perhaps written by a prophet). Job is also mentioned by the Lord in D&C, lending it some legitimacy as scripture."

I am not given to dogmatic judgments in the matter of literary creation, but if I had to make one I could say that Ecclesiastes is the greatest single piece of writing I have ever known, and the wisdom expressed in it the most lasting and profound."""

I believe there have been several non apostle members in the First Presidency if we go back far enough, but currently both quorums are filled with people who have reached that office in the priesthood.    Technically where President Thomas S. Monson sits would be where Jesus Christ would be in the church.

Someone who follows Christ is his disciple (from Latin ""pupil""), which is the word used to describe the twelve called in the New World.  Although the 12 in the new world led the church and functioned effectively like the apostles in the old world, the title apostle is not used for them.

lds,16ks9s,johnybackback,3,Tue Jan 15 05:55:28 2013 UTC,"Lots of talk about Pascal's Wager in this thread. I humbly submit the Atheist's Wager:  ""This states that you should live a good life and be a nice person, but leave religion alone. If God is loving and kind, he will forgive you for not believing in him and reward you in the afterlife. If God punishes you despite having been a good person all your life then god is unjust and you shouldn’t worship him.""  Think about it."
lds,16ks9s,DesolationRobot,4,Thu Jan 17 10:21:39 2013 UTC,"This sounds a lot like Pascal's Wager. It is an interesting argument but problematic for two reasons. First, very few seem to believe because of it in practice. Second it assumes that God would accept your belief and devotion that was just a hedge all along.   If not, then this life is the most valuable thing there is, and a tragedy to waste.   True. Though, I would say that a life following church teachings and practicing Mormonism is not a waste. I would not say that I would not do anything at all different if I knew for sure that this life was it, but on the whole, my life is a lot better practicing this religion than it would be if I did not.   Along the spectrum of lay up treasure in heaven vs. gather ye rosebuds while ye may, where do you all come in?   In short, I just don't think that these two are incompatible, within the framework of the Gospel. ""Men are that they might have joy.""  Following the Gospel simultaneously provides rosebuds now and treasure later."
lds,16ks9s,tragluk,2,Mon Jan 14 23:03:06 2013 UTC,"Great perspective.  I see what you mean about Pascal's wager and I agree, it is similar.  I guess the question is more about how is uncertainty dealt with.  Is it more denial of uncertainty (this life is nothing/there is nothing after this life) or more of an acceptance that uncertainty exists and trying to find a way that works to maximize the benefits of both perspectives."
lds,16ks9s,ronito,1 point,Mon Jan 14 23:53:19 2013 UTC,"The problem with Pascal's Wager is that your assumption that there are only two perspectives. There are actually infinite perspectives of what is after this life. What if by following Mormonism you actually make Thor displeased? Would you say denial of Thor is a denial of uncertainty? No, you just think the chance of Thor being real is so low, that the possibility he is real is so remote that while you can't be certain he isn't real, it isn't worth worrying about. So every rational person is uncertain about the afterlife, but there are so many possibilities that it doesn't make sense to live by Pascal's wager on any of them."

We don't smoke, but we do enjoy the smell of fresh air and flowers on a hike.  We don't drink, but we also don't get addicted to alcohol, have sirosis of the liver, and destroy relationships and lives due to being drunk.  We don't have premarital sex, but we do have children and families that we love and who we seal ourselves to for eternity enjoying the blessings of a family for our lives rather than the 'half an hour or so' of lust.  Why would being a good person, a faithful person, and a moral person ever been seen as a waste?  It's a choice.  Many people in this world have 'fun', we have 'joy'.  It's certainly not a waste.  On the spectrum of treasure in heavy vs gather ye rosebuds I would say we walk the moderate center.  We reap the benefits of a loving family, a healthy non-addictive life, and find happiness everywhere on earth until we are ready to move on and reap the benefits of a well lived life in heaven."

My thoughts were that we don't deny ourselves we simply find joy in other things which also lead towards heaven.  Some of the things which we are 'different' about is our (word of wisdom) WoW and our focus on the family.  There are some who believe that denying yourself alcohol is a waste if there is no eternal reward, my own view is that we aren't denying ourselves the opportunity of alcohol but we are choosing a life which is full of joy because we choose not to drink.  No, it's not black and white.  It also isn't ""Wasted life or Eternal reward"".  I'm just saying that it's possible to have an eternal reward and not waste your life at the same time."

Back in ancient times, one of the reasons polygamy was prevalent among kings was that they had the financial resources to raise children with an arbitrary number of wives, while, on the other hand, the poor men had very close to nothing.  It was a good deal for the women in this case to choose the polygamist lifestyle.  However, on Sister Wives, I've noticed that some of the wives bring in a good share of the income into the family, while others watch the children.  In ancient times polygamy was associated with tremendous wealth.  In Mormon polygamy, that was not the case; in fact it can be impoverishing."

The post was originally inspired by the polygamist threads, a question arose - what if the church reinstated polygamy.  There it would become difficult to hedge your bets due to the demands of the church.   I always chuckle when I hear Mormons say they're existentialist or use the phrase Carpe Diem   I would too.  Existentialism is diverse but there are Christian varieties of it such as that of Kierkegaard, although with a quite altered Christianity.  I can't imagine a version that could possibly fit with Mormonism.  While I don't care much for labeling my own philosophies, I do subscribe to the notion that every one must discover the meaning of their lives for themselves, instead of having it dictated to them.

lds,16jer7,adlp,2,Mon Jan 14 22:06:55 2013 UTC,"It's really a canonized part of the Standard Works, and really (in the LDS edition) has a non-canonized footnote stating that Joseph Smith didn't consider it inspired.  Does that mean that it isn't ""real"" scripture? Not really. You could call it ""allegedly uninspired"", or ""controversial"", but that doesn't make it not ""real""."
lds,16jer7,amertune,2,Mon Jan 14 20:06:36 2013 UTC,"i always thought it was Biblical trash, and we kept it in so we can still say we use the whole KJV"
lds,16jer7,wanderlust712,2,Mon Jan 14 21:33:39 2013 UTC,"McConkie said as much (he specifically used the word trash) in 1984.   In the Old Testament, Genesis is the book of books—a divine account whose worth cannot be measured. Exodus and Deuteronomy are also of surpassing worth. Numbers, Joshua, Judges, the Samuels, the Kings, and the Chronicles are all essential history, interwoven with deeds of faith and wonder that form a background for an understanding of the Christian faith. Leviticus has no special application to us and, except for a few passages, need not give us permanent concern. Ruth and Esther are lovely stories that are part of our heritage. The Psalms contain marvelous poetry, and the portions that are messianic and that speak of the last days and the Second Coming are of great import. Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Lamentations are interesting books; Job is for people who like the book of Job; and the Song of Solomon is biblical trash—it is not inspired writing. Ezra, Nehemiah, Obadiah, and Jonah are the least of the prophets; and all the rest of the prophets—Isaiah above them all—each in his place and order set forth the doctrinal and prophetic word that must be studied in depth.   Also, I was amused by ""Job is for people who like the book of Job"", and ""Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Lamentations are interesting books"". I can just imagine a pointed pause before ""interesting"", although I'm sure that's not the sense in which he was using it."
lds,16jer7,amertune,2,Mon Jan 14 21:52:59 2013 UTC,"Could you link the context of this quote? I'm not claiming it's invalid, I'm just curious about the context.   To me, it seems pretty clear to me that this is opinion versus prophetic inspiration."
lds,16jer7,mormongirl,1 point,Tue Jan 15 05:09:00 2013 UTC,"It was from The Bible, a sealed book, which looks like it was given at a CES symposium.  I would agree that he is giving his opinions, but it's undeniable that his opinions affected footnotes, chapter headings, the Bible Dictionary, etc.  It could very well be that the only reason we're aware of Joseph's note in the JST about the lack of inspiration in the Song of Solomon was that McConkie believed that note to be significant."
lds,16jer7,kayejazz,1 point,Tue Jan 15 05:51:23 2013 UTC,"I've wondered the same thing. I had a seminary teacher who once told us we could tape it closed if we wanted, but he would always quote bits of it as a joke."
lds,16jer7,everything_is_free,3,Mon Jan 14 21:47:09 2013 UTC,"i have read it all.  i have no advice on how to attack those parts of the OT.  i just sat down and read right through it.  it's pretty boring.  EDIT:  i should say that while some parts are boring (mosaic law, chronicles, some other stuff), some parts are incredibly powerful and faith promoting.  i found so many gems in the book of Deuteronomy that i would have never known about had i not waded through the ""thou shalt not""s.  so i recommend reading the OT with the mindset that parts will be boring, and that that is okay."
lds,16jer7,demon_butterfly,3,Mon Jan 14 09:25:20 2013 UTC,"I read the entirety of the standard works on my mission over 10 years ago. I hadn't read anything but the Book of Mormon since then, so I decided this year was the year to go through the Old Testament again.  I read it on my smart phone with the Gospel Library app. It's great because the footnotes are built right in and you can toggle back and forth with no lost places. It also syncs to my LDS.org account so that I can read on the computer or take notes on my phone and computer and they transfer between places. It's pretty cool. I'd recommend it, if you have that option."
lds,16jer7,arandomJohn,3,Mon Jan 14 15:41:52 2013 UTC,My wife and I are currently reading the OT all the way through (we have already read all the other standard works together several times).  One thing we are doing that really seems to help is that we are reading the KJV and NIV side by side. This makes the text much easier to understand and leads to interesting discussions about what the original writers intended and how the translators interpreted the scriptures.
lds,16jer7,amertune,3,Mon Jan 14 16:10:31 2013 UTC,I never would have thought about reading an NIV alongside my KJV. What a good idea!
lds,16jer7,xochitec,3,Mon Jan 14 18:45:15 2013 UTC,"I've read the bible covet-to-cover in detail.  I found out  all sorts of interesting, weird things.  I loved it.  Read it in order.  There is no other way to get the sweep and the scope of the book(s)."
lds,16jer7,cbfw86,3,Mon Jan 14 17:28:33 2013 UTC,If you want to read the OT all the way through for heaven's sake don't use the KJV.  Get an NRSV or something that is comprehensible.  You'll get so much more out of it.  I regret not buying one sooner.
lds,16jer7,benbernards,3,Mon Jan 14 18:05:36 2013 UTC,"I've done it. The first thing that struck me the most was that so many of the familiar Bible stories came from Genesis or Exodus.  The second thing that struck me was just how weird a lot of the stories were. There's probably a reason that we don't like sharing stories like Simeon and Levi tricking and murdering all the men in the city of Shechem because Shechem raped their sister Dinah and then wanted to marry her. What gospel principle could possibly be illustrated by that?  My favorite Old Testament book is Ecclesiastes, and least favorite would probably be Numbers. The New Testament, and especially the epistles, are a lot richer in their theology (and don't hide it as much in mythology). I have a much harder time picking favorites there, although I do have some favorite chapters. Least favorite would probably be Revelation, because it is the book that is generally the least understood but the most abused by the craziest elements of Christianity."

Most of the old testament is a total blur because I was just reading the words for the sake of, not talking it in. I read the NT on my mission in French, though (mission language). The Acts are pretty hilarious."
lds,16jer7,taho_teg,2,Mon Jan 14 12:41:55 2013 UTC,"Have read the whole thing through. Bear in mind that most of the OT was intended to be a historical record, not a doctrinal treatise (like D&C or BoM) so if you don't have an understanding of the culture of the time you'll likely get lost. Find a study bible or manual or commentary on OT (Institute books are great and free) if you want to tackle it start to finish.   And I echo what others have said here: gospel records are intended to be studied deeply and then lived, not just read through from end to end."
lds,16jer7,xochitec,3,Mon Jan 14 16:24:06 2013 UTC,"Bear in mind that most of the OT was intended to be a historical record, not a doctrinal treatise (like D&C or BoM) so if you don't have an understanding of the culture of the time you'll likely get lost.   While not a doctrinal treatise, the actions of God and the prophets do have doctrinal implications. My problem in reading the OT, is that the God of the OT is not the God that I believed in. And given the reliance of the BoM on the OT, my faith crumbled under the doctrinal questions that come up while reading the OT.   Just realize that while reading the OT that your views and understanding of God as loving and kind do not hold up in the OT. God is a jealious and vindictive character. I don't think that any of the standard works cast a consistant view of God."
lds,16jer7,jsrduck,1 point,Mon Jan 14 18:13:17 2013 UTC,"Yeah, I hear ya.   Here's how I see it:  If a stranger were to observe my house when I was a child and my parents were having a rough day, they would see a lot of physical and emotional abuse. Or if they were to ask me my feelings about my parents, they'd get a certain description and profile of them. If they were to ask a different sibling or query during a different time period, they'd likely get a very different picture. Which would be correct? Which would be most accurate?  As I see it, relying on one single book of scripture to establish a complete  and correct image of god, any god, will be an exercise in futility...or at the very least, leave you with a one-dimensional view that won't take into account the entire context. Also we have to remember that scriptures are shaped and influenced by their authors and translators, who will choose what to record and when and how to describe it. (Perfect example: lifelong warrior Mormon and the Alma war chapters vs. philosopher / teacher Jacob and his book...)  For me, reading about a god from the past that seems to contradict my view of god in the present doesn't break faith...it gives me more information to help fill in the puzzle. (Knowing what I know now about God's character...why would He act that way to those people? Why did they choose to record what they did? And how much of that record is to be interpreted as a literal, infallible record of absolute truth, vs. a thematic parable or symbolic metaphor?)  Bottom line: I view the scriptures as a stepping stone to feeling the Holy Ghost, which is in turn a stepping stone to helping me have a direct personal relationship with God...and that is where I'd get the most complete picture of His character."
lds,16jer7,WooperSlim,2,Mon Jan 14 18:27:54 2013 UTC,"My wife and I are almost done with the Old Testament. We decided to read every chapter unless it was a big list of names or something, then we would just skip ahead or read the heading. There are still many tedious sections, but it's gone pretty fast. The advantage of reading everything is the little hidden gems, but it is hard to stay focused. I would say the best way to get the most out of the Old Testament is to look up all of the oddities. Even the Bible dictionary doesn't have everything, so you may need some additional sources."
lds,16jer7,WooperSlim,2,Mon Jan 14 16:40:19 2013 UTC,"Yes, first as a missionary, then again after my mission.  I should probably again.  I agree with others about getting a guide, though, if you want to understand it.  Startlingly beautiful in places, other places it's pure drudgery.  Genesis, Psalms, Ecclesiastes are lovely, for example.  Oh, and I always like Ezekiel quite a lot.  The last three books of Moses, then Chronicles, Kings, argh, no fun.  In the NT, Paul was a wonderful writer, a skill that proved indispensable to Christianity."
lds,16jer7,C0unt_Z3r0,2,Mon Jan 14 21:48:31 2013 UTC,"I read the whole thing on my mission, mostly because I was sick of the question ""have you read the whole bible?""  The reason so few people do it is because there are definitely large parts of the Old Testament that aren't that useful or interesting. The first half or so of Numbers is a census for example.  That being said, there's a lot of interesting stuff in the Old Testament that doesn't make the cut for Sunday School, so I recommend it at least once."
lds,16jer7,gunstarhero7,2,Tue Jan 15 00:31:24 2013 UTC,"Wow, looks like a lot of us have read the entire Bible.  I read the Bible straight through when I was on my mission.  This may or may not be the best way to read it.  But I had the Spirit when I read, and I really gained an appreciation for the Old Testament that I didn't have before.  It seems like it is a common thing for Christians to discard the Old Testament as not applying anymore.  But we spend an entire year studying it in Sunday School, which is a lot for a book that supposedly doesn't apply.  When I read it, I was surprised at all the hidden treasures I found.  It's been a while, I should probably read all the standard works again."
lds,16jer7,kmolleja,2,Tue Jan 15 04:17:23 2013 UTC,"I know, right? Plenty of statistics I've read say that hardly anyone has actually read it, yet there are loads of people here who are very familiar with the scriptures. Maybe Mormons just know how to read 'em? Or is it that Redditors are just really literate? (cough cough over-complimenting)"
lds,16jer7,rcthompson88,2,Tue Jan 15 04:23:57 2013 UTC,"I personally think more Mormons have read the Bible just because we go out as missionaries and we have to actually teach and defend what we believe, which is much easier to do when you read the source materiel.  For that reason, I imagine Jehovah's Witnesses and members of other churches that do missionary work have a higher percentage of people who have read the Bible.  I think Redditors probably do study more, but it may be related to the same effect -- if you are going to defend your beliefs on the internet, it helps if you have read your scriptures."

My take is that with all the scriptures (not just the Bible), I take more away when I study by topic, selectively.  The BoM is more coherent than the rest to me from a ""story"" standpoint, but I can't see a whole lot of value just reading scripture cover-to-cover once you've done it once.  The story becomes less important than the doctrine so go after the doctrine and forget the chronology unless it is crucial for understanding (like sometimes in the D&C).  JMHO"

lds,16jer7,drivec,1 point,Mon Jan 14 14:06:19 2013 UTC,On my mission I read through the entire Standard Works.  I did this outside of my actual scripture study though.  I would say that reading through the Old Testament was certainly worth it.  I feel like I got a lot of little insights here and there as I read through.  Reading it through as a whole also gave me a better context when i would go back through and cherry pick out scriptures to share or study because I know knew the general story surrounding the passage.
lds,16jer7,titanicx,1 point,Mon Jan 14 15:23:46 2013 UTC,"Yep. I think everyone should just pound through it from cover to cover one time, to get a good overview of what's in there. After that you can study however you like."

lds,16jer7,akmetal,1 point,Mon Jan 14 17:03:11 2013 UTC,I have read it cover to cover many times. I would suggest reading it like that to anyone. It is instructive to know the history of ancient Israel.

I personall like to read it from cover to cover, but if there's a particular subject your interested in, then read selectively. When I want to read selectively I'll go to the bible dictionary and pick something that looks interesting.   I struggle with the Old Testament, particularly the Law of Moses stuff.   tough luck. good thing is, It's not all that important to our current commandments(The Jesus patch and all). understanding the law of moses increases your understanding of the bible, but that's about it in my opinion. But what do I know, I'm only 18.  Revelations is always a good read."
lds,16jer7,istayawake,1 point,Mon Jan 14 18:00:45 2013 UTC,"I read through the entire standard works when I was younger. I'd recommend doing it at least once, and then study with a study guide after that. There's a lot of stuff in the Old Testament that's pretty slow, so that'll be your biggest hurdle in starting from the beginning."
lds,16jer7,panserbjorner,1 point,Mon Jan 14 18:51:31 2013 UTC,"I've read it cover to cover, and I would highly recommend it. Daily study from manuals and the topical guide will help tremendously in understanding the doctrines of the gospel, but they are not comprehensive. There are alot of verses that I've never found in topical scripture study that I've found simply by reading carefully cover-to-cover. My understanding of the gospel would be less complete if I'd never read the entire standard works."
lds,16jer7,istayawake,1 point,Mon Jan 14 19:45:20 2013 UTC,"I know I have read all the scriptures more then once. I find using the cross references provided help immensely when you can't figure out the meaning. I always felt behind since I wasn't raised in the church so I had studied them very hard. I still read them, but not the same as I had before, Once you go through them once like this it becomes more of a digging deeper type of read the next time through, so it always takes much longer."

For a while there, the branch was in a different building where they couldn't accommodate almost any crossover between units due to limited parking and classroom space.  As a result, we were on the 3pm-6pm schedule.  I can assure you that getting out of church well after dark in the middle of the Chicago winter is not that much fun--especially for those people who then had an hour-plus commute on public transportation.  That made the 11:30 schedule all the sweeter."

Get to know the people, ask the kids' names, etc. etc. Leave a short little five minute lesson at the end, usually goes, ""So this month's message from the Ensign is [blank] and I really like that because [blank]. I'm going to read one paragraph from it now. How do you feel about that? Well yeah that's really important you guys so you know keep it real, keep doing [blank], and I'll see you next month"".

lds,16j9qc,mormongirl,1 point,Mon Jan 14 16:33:19 2013 UTC,"It is also really nice when a home teacher takes initiative in looking for a need to fill.  Like maybe you HT a single sister who is sick and you can offer a blessing (or offer to find someone to do it).  or maybe there's a teenage son who normally does well in school but is really worried about his upcoming geometry test and you're a geometry whiz and would love to spend a few minutes going over some thing with him.    you don't need to go overboard with this, obviously, and theres a good chance that your home teachees are just fine.  but there have been times when ive had a HT offer something that i really needed but i hadnt thought to ask for.  when HTs do this it shows me that they really care and are not just HTing out of obligation."
lds,16j9qc,Thuseld,4,Wed Jan 16 11:11:08 2013 UTC,"Home teaching is basically a sneaky way for the church to make us all be friends. My home teaching companions of the past are all still great friends, and my families (that are still alive, or psychologically aware) are also great friends still, even though I am not assigned to them anymore.  So go into it with this sort of attitude. Learn names, birthdays (and try to remember them), chat, get to know, and leave a spiritual message (smacktaix gives a good example). The better you know them, the better you will know how to adjust the message to fit their needs.   Always offer to help them in anything. And if they need anything, do it, or organise something if you can't help yourself. On Christmas day my Dad got a call from his family saying one of them needed a blessing. So he grabbed me, we threw on our suits and shimmied on over. It was a great feeling.   Home teaching is a very rewarding assignment."

You know you're doing it right when the family loves you back.  Be friends.  Have a BBQ, a game night, whatever.  When you love them for who they are, they'll open up and you can be a powerful influence for good in their lives.  If they don't know that you REALLY care, though, at best you can present a message that they may or may not listen to, and help out with really obvious, possibly useful, but probably not essential things."

Enjoy the moment with your family and close friends, as well as the spirit you feel performing the ordinance.    Also, ask your wife if she would like you to say anything specific in the blessing.  Make sure you include her in the exercise of your priesthood.  Too often we grab the reigns and go off without including our spouses.  You might be surprised what her response is, and what is important for her.  Also, major brownie points."

I'm not saying she gets to put words in my mouth, but having a heart to heart with her about our newly born child a day or so before the blessing has been a very beneficial practice in our marriage.  It's a chance to talk about your hopes and aspirations for the child, and thoughts about special needs that you think they might have.    I've done this with all four of our children, and the conversation has always been rewarding.  And it gets me thinking about what I'm going to say in the actual blessing.  By the time the blessing comes around, I'm in a much different mindset, and I have never felt like our discussion superseded any promptings from the spirit.    With a couple of our children, she surprised me with some of her concerns and thoughts.  They were things I wasn't even thinking about, and it got us on the same page from very early on about how we were going to parent our children.    Were there things that she mentioned that did not make it into the blessings?  Absolutely.  It was not like I had a laundry list of items to check off - it's more preparation for the actual ordinance.  Also, my wife feels involved in the process, which is rewarding for her."

Eyring's Priesthood session talk. here    Now, I cannot tell every father and every leader of youth the details of what is best for you to do. But I can promise you that you will bless them to help them recognize the spiritual gifts with which they were born.    For this week, write down a few things you would like your son to be blessed with.  Keep the spirit in mind, but you are an Elder and Patriarch in your home. Speak with your wife.  You are both entitled to inspiration, and if your wife is like mine, you'll feel less nervous about it with her input and encouragement. Make it your own.  You don't have to copy-cat everything others say, and you can say things your buddies did not. (this probably won't be a problem) Don't carry on for too long.  Say what comes to you, but don't worry about making a big speech.  A blessing should be comfortable and memorable.  Sometimes people get nervous, baby starts crying, and they ramble on about how pretty their wife will be.  Just keep it simple.   For what it's worth, I chose 2 words to bless each child with, and it was different with each child.  (Wisdom and Compassion, Strength and Honor, Truth and Beauty, Health and Strength).  As they are growing, I can see traits that match up with those attributes I blessed them with.  The best experience I had was while blessing my youngest, she was asleep and as I started the blessing, she woke up, opened her eyes really big, and grinned from ear to ear.  She hadn't smiled directly at me before that.  Best experience of using the Priesthood in a long time.  It is a really great experience, and I wish you well.  Feel free to report back if you like!

As if somehow, the simple act of looking at and occasionally saying aloud words on a page would somehow, via osmosis or some other passive method, affect that mighty change of heart that we as members are constantly chasing.  Reading scriptures alone will NOT do that.  Nor is that what it means to truly study them.  Yet somehow, we often perpetuate this with our children.  As a father of two, I am guilty of this - focusing on the simple mechanics of actually coming together and reading the scriptures and forgetting the importance of actual application.  The reason I found this post so interesting is that it reminded me personally that I need to do a better job as a father teaching my children a) that reading the scriptures is not enough and b) HOW to go about applying what is gleaned from what is read (how to experiment upon the word as Alma describes), then to provide opportunities for such experiences tailored to the things that they have read.

It's an interesting question.  Our nature would likely change.  Other Christian faiths tend to categorize boredom as a weakness of the flesh, which explains why their conceptions of heaven include the beatific vision and ideas such as praising the Lord for the eternities.  Without boredom, even sitting down, staring at the paint on a wall for eternity would be endlessly fascinating.  Boredom itself seems like a trifling emotion, but it deeply shapes the human condition.  I was just looking on the wikipedia page and saw this quote by Pascal:   ""we seek rest in a struggle against some obstacles. And when we have overcome these, rest proves unbearable because of the boredom it produces""   My wife makes fun of me when I go into a funk once I finish a long video game (or sometimes other projects).  So much comes out of boredom.  Boredom is necessary in order to shift attention to interesting stimuli.  Mormonism has a radically human God, one who was once human.  He was somehow motivated to create a world, introduce choice into it, and wait to see what happens.  I don't know if He experiences boredom as we do, but as a human being, you might narrate His decision to create the world as a response to boredom, just as one might clean the house or write an opera because the alternative, boredom, is unbearable.  Of course, this line of thought brings out all sort of questions."

I'm also a convert to the church, about 12 years now. And while I consider myself faithful, death does terrify me.   It bugs me when there's a funeral, and someone invariably talks about how WONDERFUL it was. You see, they've been to ""other"" funerals and it was so depressing because <gasp> people were so sad! Those poor, poor people who don't know the truth. Isn't it great that we know the truth!  Or, the Sunday School lessons where someone mentions ""how awful it would be"" to be not a member of the church, and not have the sweet peace of ""knowing what comes next"". You get the feeling that we should all be actually happy to die. Wouldn't that be great? Maybe a little sad, but great!  Since I have spent a good portion of my life being one of those ""other people"", these statements bother me. I feel time passing, and know that my parents will die, my wife will die, I will die. Life doesn't always proceed the way you envision it, in the simple chunks that gospel principles presents (born, live, have kids, die, spirit paradise here we come!) My kids may die before me, I may die just from accident or disease, or be crippled by illness. Loss of life, loss of potential.   A lot of people do not experience the kind of mortal experience they planned on when they were 20. Or even 40. Those are part of this life, even if you have faith.  One of the neglected subtle messages in LDS teachings is that loss of life is bitter and unpleasant. Granted, the atonement can help heal it, but that is not to say that it isn't real (""Beauty for Ashes"" by Elder Bruce Hafen, or ""Irony: the crust on the bread of adversity"" by Elder Maxwell). The pain and frustration is real -- why else should you covenant to mourn with those who mourn, if the believers were only supposed to feel such great peace about death?  Personally, death terrifies me. It's very difficult to recover from death. Fire burns claims your house and all your belongings? That's really bad, but you're still alive, and you can possibly get another house some day. Lose all your money? You're still alive. Even losing limbs: you can have many happy moments. Death? Regardless of your testimony, everyone agrees that that part of the ride is just over. Your child dies, and that vacation you were planning a year from now is just not going to happen.   Now, many, many people feel like they KNOW there is life after death. I really, really hope so. But I'm also very objective, a bit of a Bayesian at heart. Regardless of my personal biases and prior beliefs, there is definitely a non-zero probability that this is just the end. There would have to be a lot more evidence for me to feel comfortable saying I KNOW that I will see this person again.   The fear of death however does not increase my confidence in my faith, because wanting something does not make it more true. If I told someone who had just lost a job ""Don't you feel so much peace KNOWING you will find a million dollars tomorrow?"" it does not actually make them more likely find a million dollars.  Instead, I stare the future down like a viking challenging a storm. I steer around rocky adversity as best I can, and brace myself for the unavoidable swells of death. Understanding that it's coming makes me aware of the beautiful parts of the sea that I'm in now.  I do hope -- wouldn't it be great? -- that there is another harbor after death's swell. Envisioning the storm doesn't make me believe in the harbor after it any more though.  TL;DR: The inevitable sting of death is both terrifying and motivating, but it's coming regardless, and doesn't increase my faith in what comes after."

Death is simply the end of this life. If there was nothing at the end of it, I would hope that the life I lived was the best it was, and that my immortality lived on in the people who's lives I've touched.  Sometimes, I hear people talking about how they feel their life would be horrible without the gospel. To me, that's a very surface feeling, not altogether deep. The gospel enhances a life worth living, at least in my view. If we are not living our life as though it could be the only one we're giving, than we're not really living. This life means so much more, and sometimes, when I hear people talk about the afterlife, and how the only reason they do not fear death is that they have the gospel...

lds,16fvqo,jgardner,5,Mon Jan 14 02:14:11 2013 UTC,"I haven't seen Big Love, but for the most part, I would say that unless the actions of the practicing person negatively impacted the church, they wouldn't really care, other than to make it clear that the church does not endorse polygamy as a current practice."
lds,16fvqo,kayejazz,2,Sat Jan 12 16:51:29 2013 UTC,"I can definitely understand that point of view.  I just find it odd that polygamy was dropped in 1890, and Utah became a state a few years later. It just seems like more of a political move than a doctrinal move. Those are where my concerns are coming from.  Is this doctrine based more upon the laws of the land moreso than revelation and changing of the faith?"
lds,16fvqo,theCroc,4,Sat Jan 12 17:08:35 2013 UTC,"Dropping polygamy was definitely related to the political situation and the law of the land. This isn't something we try to hide--if you read the excerpts from Wilford Woodruff's addresses that follow Official Declaration 1 in the Doctrine and Covenants he makes this quite clear.  Dropping polygamy was also based on revelation. These two things are not inconsistent. Once again, OD1 and Wilford Woodruff's explanation of it make this clear.  To answer your original question, I don't think most LDS people individually would care all that much if a polygamist were elected to the senate, like kayejazz says. Practicing polygamy is currently grounds for excommunication from the church, so obviously this hypothetical polygamist would not be a member of the church."
lds,16fvqo,amertune,3,Sat Jan 12 17:19:25 2013 UTC,"Thanks for helping me understand this more.   Now let me speak more in hypotheticals here. If the current president of the church had a revelation that polygamy was now considered okay to reinstate again, would the populace have a 180 degree change of heart and accept it as a current practice? (Even though all would not engage in it?)  This is something I wonder about not just polygamy, but in general - for all doctrines of the church."
lds,16fvqo,kayejazz,2,Sat Jan 12 17:25:54 2013 UTC,"Some would, some wouldn't. Some would accept it but hope they would not be called upon to do it. Every major change in the church has had people fall away. People left when the church moved to ohio. People left when they were commanded to build a temple in far west. People left when Joseph ordered Zions Camp to stand down without fighting. People left during the succesion crisis. People left when polygamy was instated, people left when polygamy was removed. People left when blacks got the priesthood. People left over prop 8. (Not that many but some did)   Basically any time the prophet makes a major declaration he will rub some people the wrong way and they will leave."
lds,16fvqo,johnybackback,2,Sat Jan 12 17:36:35 2013 UTC,"Some members of the church would, but I expect there would be a lot of resistance--just like there was a lot of resistance when it was revealed the first time around. At that point, the duty of the members of the church is to pray for a personal witness that the church leaders were indeed acting under revelation and taking the right course. This talk by Dallin H. Oaks comes to mind--while it doesn't address this directly, it talks about the duality between the line of revelation through which we receive official teachings and instructions for the church and the direct revelation through which we receive personal instructions and revelations."
lds,16fvqo,amertune,1 point,Sat Jan 12 17:42:25 2013 UTC,"would the populace have a 180 degree change of heart and accept it as a current practice?    Polygamy is a difficult topic. Many left (and still leave) the church when they discovered Joseph Smith's polygamy (there is also a case to be made that polygamy was significant in the role of Joseph Smith's death). There was a minor schism when Wilford Woodruff discontinued polygamy (FLDS and other polygamous groups were part of the LDS church before they left to keep practicing ""the principle"" (polygamy)). Any change to something so significant is going to have fallout.  I think that this would likely lead to a schism in the church. Some members would be enthusiastic, some would be reserved but accepting, and some would reject it."
lds,16fvqo,everything_is_free,5,Sat Jan 12 17:37:57 2013 UTC,"It's true that there was a lot of political pressure surrounding the cessation of polygamy. The Edmunds-Tucker Act was passed in 1887, making polygamy illegal in the US. This wasn't an issue unless Utah joined the union. Utah wasn't made a state until 1896, but the end of polygamy was a condition in statehood. Polygamous marriages were enacted after statehood, but the majority of those who lived in plural marriage were in Colonial Juarez in Mexico and other colonies outside the official US.   The thing about polygamy and the current church is that we still believe it as a principle. From the Old Testament to now, the church has has polygamy as a teaching, if not always a practice.   We stopped because God told us to, plain and simple. It doesn't necessarily follow that God wouldn't make decisions based on what would best help the church survive. The consequences of continuing in polygamy would have been dire for the church. An army was sent to the Utah Territory at one point (see Utah War) and it could have happened again. The Edmunds-Tucker Act disenfranchised the church and seized all their assets. It seems really likely that God would make changes to keep His church around. It's a case of correlation not being the same as causation, as we say in psychology."
lds,16fvqo,everything_is_free,2,Sat Jan 12 17:43:58 2013 UTC,It definitely makes sense that it would be a belief and practice that would have been detrimental to the followers would be temporarily suspended by God. Thanks for your responses :)
lds,16fvqo,POOR_IMPULSE_CONTR0L,2,Sat Jan 12 21:01:00 2013 UTC,"First of all, bigamy was already a crime in every state of the union before the passage of that act. Second, it was most certainly an issue before Utah was granted statehood as it was a federal territory, and that is why there was the Utah War you linked to.    And I don't think there was anything plain or simple with the process used to stop polygamy. It was a very messy process, hence the reason you have tens of thousands in the state still living in it."
lds,16fvqo,everything_is_free,3,Sun Jan 13 03:00:59 2013 UTC,"It was certainly politically expedient, as all of the church property was being confiscated and church leaders were living in hiding or being arrested.  Here is how Wilford Woodruff (the Prophet/President of the Church at the time) described it:   I saw exactly what would come to pass if there was not something done. I have had this spirit upon me for a long time. But I want to say this: I should have let all the temples go out of our hands; I should have gone to prison myself, and let every other man go there, had not the God of heaven commanded me to do what I did do; and when the hour came that I was commanded to do that, it was all clear to me. I went before the Lord, and I wrote what the Lord told me to write.   Official Declaration 1   There is no question that polygamy would have been shut down by the government, the only question is whether the church was right to shut it down before they lost everything or if they should have waited until after.  We say that we don't practice polygamy, and that to practice it is an excommunicable offense, but as far as I'm aware here is the doctrine on polygamy:   And I now publicly declare that my advice to the Latter-day Saints is to refrain from contracting any marriage forbidden by the law of the land.   Oh, one other bit of fallout from a polygamous senator: I think that he would probably be disqualified for violating federal anti-bigamy laws.  Edit: pulled out a stray ""were"""
lds,16fvqo,POOR_IMPULSE_CONTR0L,2,Sat Jan 12 17:28:02 2013 UTC,"Thank you for that in depth response. Alright, so that explains it a bit further. So basically, if polygamy was something that the government was okay with (let's just say one official marriage for tax purposes and the rest as temple sealings and spiritual marriages) then the church would be okay to practice it again?  I can see that as a good move on part of the church. So, it's pretty much church belief that it's ""on hold for now""?"
lds,16fvqo,xochitec,3,Sat Jan 12 17:31:43 2013 UTC,"I think that if polygamy were decriminalized (no longer a crime) and even legalized (recognized and protected by the government), the church would still prohibit it. We've gone too far condemning it to turn back now. Currently, even in countries where polygamy is legal, the church prohibits it."
lds,16fvqo,POOR_IMPULSE_CONTR0L,2,Sat Jan 12 19:07:35 2013 UTC,"I guess I'm confused by that statement. If it was truly a commandment of God and a part of the faith, how would ""going too far condemning it to turn back now"" be much of an excuse for the church?"
lds,16fvqo,xochitec,3,Sat Jan 12 20:57:40 2013 UTC,"If it was truly a commandment of God and a part of the faith...   Here's the problem. The church has moved so far and we avoid the topic so thoroughly that we don't even know if that is true (people argue about that all the time on this sub). Even if it were (which is what I actually think), because we believe in continuing revelation, current revelation trumps and overrules that of past leaders.   But Most important, is the fact that Mormon culture itself has shifted. Through the schisms that occurred after the manifesto, those that liked polygamy were selected out into the fundamentalists. Those that remained were much more opposed to polygamy. And from that time on, this culture has continued to shift. First, as the church moved more mainstream and assimilationist in the early and mid twentieth century and then again in the latter part of the twentieth century when the church retrenched and emphasized ""traditional family values"" (i.e. one man, one woman).  The church is very unlikely to go somewhere where the culture is not ready to go. If the culture shifted for some reason, Then I could see it maybe happening."

Furthermore, the leaders of the Church would only reinstate it if God told them to. Any member willing to criticize the Church for doing something God told it to do is not a member we should be paying any attention to anyways."
lds,16fvqo,xochitec,2,Sun Jan 13 01:04:16 2013 UTC,"What I'm saying here is not that it would not happen because the members would not accept it if the leaders reinstated it. I think you are right. Most would, though it would probably lead to the largest apostasy in modern church history. I'm saying that the leaders will almost certainly not reinstate it because the culture (including the culture of church leaders) is so much against it.   the leaders of the Church would only reinstate it if God told them to   Even so, God rarely gives revelations to the church that people are not ready for."

See, it interferes with the goal of converting the world, which will always find (non-consenting) polygamy repugnant.  I say non-consenting because practicing it under the threat of an angel with a flaming sword is not consent.  If the Lord ever really wanted polygamy, women and men would be born in 3:1 ratios."

Firstly, two of your points are false because the Church changed, not due to pressure from within or without, but because obeying the law of the land is seen as a higher commandment than the issue in question. Secondly, your reference to the blacks being able to hold the Priesthood is silly because there was no social pressure to do it in 1978, but there was tons in the 60s, and they ignored it all.  The church would not care if 90% of its membership left. They would only care about doing what God told them to do. Also, as the world is now I'm pretty sure that the only place in its entirety that would have a problem with polygamy is the Bible belt, and who cares what they think?"

The law of the land more important than the new and everlasting covenant?  The first few prophets certainly didn't think so.  Polygamy was illegal even when it was revealed to Joseph Smith.   Secondly, your reference to the blacks being able to hold the Priesthood is silly because there was no social pressure to do it in 1978, but there was tons in the 60s, and they ignored it all.   The NAACP sued the church over a policy that disallowed black boys from being troop leaders in 74.  There were protests against BYU sporting events.  Additionally, there were issues with the church expanding in Brazil, and building a temple there.  I have heard (but don't have a source right now) that BYU was at risk of losing its accreditation for discrimination.  The pressure was intense.   The church would not care if 90% of its membership left. They would only care about doing what God told them to do.   This is naive.  The church cares tremendously about its growth, and it cares about being mainstream, as in recent years it has been soft-pedaling its most distinctive doctrines.   I'm pretty sure that the only place in its entirety that would have a problem with polygamy is the Bible belt   I don't think this is the case.  You're right that modern society doesn't care as much as it used to how many people you have a sexual/cohabiting relationship with.  It's not so much the polygamy aspect, as it is the question of consent in religiously-coerced polygamy and subjugation of women that is part and parcel of it that offends people."

They see them as extremists and as giving the mainstream religion a bad name, but also recognize the irony that many of their ancestors and the early leaders of the church whom they revere were polygamists.  Still, Mormons don't really protest things for religious reasons. Notice, for example, the complete absence of protests or demonstrations of the Book of Mormon Musical.  If a polygamist were to run for major office, I imagine that there would be a lot of rhetoric from mormons about how a public official should not flaunt ""the laws of the land.""

Mormons generally dislike greatly the FLDS church because they are a cult which abuses their women and their children.  Also, with Big Love, that show was directed and produced by a gay couple who did it specifically to slander the Mormon Church itself because of its anti gay marriage stances.

However, what if there was a person (like for example, on Big Love) a person who wasn't part of the FLDS and practiced polygamy? That's kind of a big part of the storyline - him trying to differentiate himself from the FLDS. So, a lot of that is where my curiosity came from.

You're definitely not alone in having atheistic leanings (or, full blown committed atheistic beleifs, what have you). I used to be ashamed to admit my own ""atheistic tendencies"", but I found that when I confessed them to my brothers (who I consider beacons of faith), they just looked at me and basically said, ""Duh. We all do. No one KNOWS there is a god, and no one KNOWS the church is true, despite what you hear in sacrament meeting. That struggle, when you try to cope with the ever present doubts, and that desire to believe IS faith-- not having perfect unshakable knowledge or even beleifs.""   I've basically been trying to understand God and the universe since I was around 14. I quickly ran up against an infinite regress of Gods (aka turtles all the way down) due to the ""As man is God once was, As God is man may become"" philosophy.  I've been pondering this puzzle ever since, and have come up with these possibilities:   God is Eternal, uncreated, and outside of the universe (the classical Christian position) God lives within the universe, and was once a man. The universe is Eternal and uncreated, and Gods (an infinite number of them--an endless chain with no beginning) work within it (""As man is God once was"" philosophy with a single universe) God created the universe, and was once a man. This requires an infinite number of universes created by Gods (an infinite number of them--again an endless chain with no beginning). (""As man is God once was"" philosophy with infinite universes) The universe has always existed, and there is no God   It basically comes down to either God/gods are just there, or the universe is just there. If the universe is so complex that it requires a God to create it, then how is God simple enough to just exist?  Rationally thinking, I don't see a necessity for God for all of this to exist. There are certainly unanswered questions about how we got here, but throwing God in doesn't provide answers--it just makes the questions bigger.  At the same time, I have experienced/felt some things that leaves me open to the possibility that God could exist. I've never had the sort of experiences that people relate all the time that have left them certain that God is real, but I've felt enough to leave me open to wanting to believe.  As a missionary, I believed and testified of God, but the first part of ""A Child's Prayer"" was frequently in my head. ""Heavenly Father, are you really there? And do you hear and answer every child's prayer?""  Hymns have always made me feel closer to God than anything else, but I've had similar feelings from listening to John Lennon sing Imagine.  I believe in God, but it is because I choose faith and not because I have any certainty.  I believe in Prophets, but I see them constantly working within their culture and understanding--often repeating things they've been taught and frequently being wrong, occasionally even on fundamentals.  I believe in Scripture, but I see that it is often unclear, or is repeated mythology, or sometimes even fabricated. Basically, I view it as the work of man, inspired by God.  I can see many reasons to not believe, but I choose to have faith (some times more than others) because I see something to all of this, and see that it is (or at least can be) good."

You have to either have a very specific testimony of God, Jesus, the current prophet, etc., or you fail your interview and can't be a Mormon anymore.  People attempting to live ""the third way"" are given explicit instructions on how to lie during these interviews by stretching the meanings of certain words to the breaking point.    I don't intend to condemn anyone here for such tactics.  People feel that they have to do it to keep their families and their community.  Until official interviews stop asking detalied questions about the specific nature of belief the focus will be on testimony, and people who can't answer the questions properly will leave,  Or will lie, which is unsustainable.  I think the Interviews should stop.  Let people judge their own level of righteousness.  That's how to get people back to the church.  And coming clean about polygamy.

You can still go to church, you just have to stop going to the temple or holding any significant callings. It's also possible that you can have significant doubt, answer the questions honestly, and still be told that it's good enough. That part really depends on your Bishop's (and Stake President's) judgement.  I think that we should still hold a temple recommend as an ideal, but that we should be a lot more accepting/forgiving of anybody who does not desire or qualify for that idea.

I also don't currently have one of those understanding bishops - women wearing pants to church is just about more than he can bear - so, yeah.   I can see why you left this option out when said the options were lie or leave. I can also understand why it's not an attractive option--without a strong belief motivating attendance, why would anybody want to stick around as a second-class citizen?  As for ideals, Christianity and Mormonism are full of unrealized ideals. We humans can treat each other horribly.

It seems that there are lots of people that choose not to believe in God because they believe that there is sufficient evidence to conclude that God isn't real. I, however, look at that same evidence and think that that is sufficient evidence to believe otherwise.   In the Book of Mormon, Alma wrote, ""All things denote there is a God."" Ever since I read those words, I've started to pay more attention to the world around me.

Implying that someone who is legitmately questioning whether or not God exists should or could have a Korihor experience is frankly rude. I would suggest that the vast and overwhelming majority of atheists or atheist agnostics don't meet the level of Korihor who knew that God existed, yet denied him anyway. To suggest that atheists rise to the prerequisate level of knowledge to have a Korihor experience is to question the honesty of the atheist.   I remember as a TBM thinking myself superior when I would trot out the Korihor story to slap down atheists. It was the ultimate trump card. However, it is intellectually dishonest (as it doesn't address the questions raised by atheist), it's a false claim to authority (the authority and legitimacy of the story has not been established), and it treats the person who asked the question as childish. To the member, it tells them never question if God exists, because you might end up trampled to death after being struck dumb. Quite honestly, any members should serious reconsider using the Korihor story to refute atheism because it doesn't not address the issue.   If God is so childish to give people reasons to question His existence, and then condemn those who boldly question, then He is nothing more than a tyrant."

You are presupposing that God also infers the existence of Christ, Abraham, et. al. This doesn't necessarily follow. There are many possible variations of a deity. Doesn't your God transcend time and space? So 2000 years here is completely negligible.  However, this is not necessarily the case. Back to the original premise, if God is real, then his existence should be readily demonstrable. Since it is not, I remain skeptical.  Since we are talking about the present, and whether evidence for God is here right now, I posit that if you accept your evidence as proof of God, then you have to believe in flying saucers and aliens. There is much more ""proof"" for UFOs than there is for God. You're fighting a losing battle if you're looking for proof.  I love how you readily admit that the ""proof"" you have of Abraham and Christ is considered unreliable, though.  Also, I readily admit my negligence.

With as skeptical as I am of the reliability of spiritual experiences as a source of knowledge due to (1) how easily they can be attributed to cognitive biases and brain chemistry, and (2) how they lead different people to incompatible results (ie, believing muslims and mormons will each claim to have felt God's spirit as a confirmation of their beliefs), I'm not sure what it would take for me to believe.  For example, if on a random Thursday night I had a vision wherein I saw and spoke with God the Father and his Son while feeling the holy spirit I'd be more inclined to check the mushrooms I had on my burger at dinner than start a religion."

If you want to be pedantic in order to quibble with my logic, be my guest, but you know damn well how incompatible with mormonism the core truth claims of most religions are.  What of a Catholic praying for confirmation of her church's unbroken apostolic succession and divine authority, vs a Mormon praying for confirmation of the apostasy and subsequent restoration of the priesthood?    How about a Mormon feeling all tingly about Joseph Smith vs a Seventh Day Adventist's burning in the bosom related to Ellen White and her visions?  Why do spiritual experiences so often confirm the religion of one's birth/parents?  Does the Holy Ghost broadcast on different frequencies in different parts of the world?  By global/historical standards, the Mormon ""broadcast"" isn't terribly effective or geographically broad.  14 million (or 4, depending on the math) people is a drop in the bucket compared to Islam, Catholicism, or the Asian traditions.  Even within the church, people will receive (what I see as) contradictory witnesses on such /r/lds favorites as polygamy, green tea, and the priesthood ban, to say nothing of fundamentalists or heretics who feel that they've got god cheering for them as they ride their hobby horse of choice.

The self-reported experiences of Mormons who've prayed to their deity, and said that he's answered their prayers or that they have personal relationships with him. I don't feel that I have any reason to doubt most of them, or any basis for saying they're wrong that wouldn't invalidate my own experiences with different spirits and deities.  What do you believe about Him?  I wouldn't normally visit /r/lds and tell Mormons my thoughts about their god so bluntly, but since you asked I'm going to assume that you actually want to know. This is meant to inform, not to bait; I'd rather not argue my subjective experiences, and I'm going to try to keep this from turning into an attack on LDS church members.  I have an extremely negative opinion of your deity. I think he honestly believes himself to be omnipotent and omniscient, and to be able to do no wrong, and is letting you all believe that even though no kami truly is like that. I think he lets a lot of terrible things happen to his own worshipers for someone who's supposedly like that, and I'm not convinced by the excuses he uses; ""you didn't have enough faith,"" ""I was testing you,"" ""I punished you for not following an arbitrary rule.""  I think he has too many such rules, that most of them make zero sense, and that he gives way too much power to people who are just as fallible as he is, to enforce these rules or make up ones of their own. I also think he's incredibly petty and spiteful, uses ""because I said so"" in arguments way too often, and has let his leaders spread a lot of mean lies about gays, atheists, people who've left his church, and anyone else he doesn't like.  I get that he's not all bad, and that a lot of people have had more positive experiences with him (many of which you're probably jumping to share because you feel it will ""prove"" my personal experience wrong). I don't see how that makes him any different from other narcissistic, abusive parents, like mine, or how his being nice to one person makes it okay to be mean to others.  Do you believe God is a Him?  I believe he's entitled to have whatever gender identity he wants. I think he should stop speaking for his wife / wives though, and let them have a say in your church's affairs."

The end of your argument will likely be realizing that you are using different definitions. Mormons believe that humans are ontologically similar to Gods. We are the same category of being as them only in different stages of our development. Like a caterpillar is the same category of being as a butterfly. Many other religions, including Judaism, believe that humans are ontologically distinct from Gods.   Your question is essentially asking if the term human applies to God's and man or just to man as one might ask whether Lepidoptera is a term for just caterpillars or caterpillars and butterflies(in that case it is). In that context, I don't really know the answer to your question but since it is just semantics after all I'm not worried too worried about it.   TL;DR: I don't know, but it doesn't matter.

Given the fact that the second route is probably much harder to do, I would need a pretty strong confirmation from God that it is what he wants me to do or that the church is true.

The Church teaches that temptations, or thoughts or impulses that enter the mind, are not sin.

That's fine, it's up to him, I guess.  Us hetero-folk have the satisfaction and promise of enjoying a ""normal"" marriage, gaining spousal and heavenly support, and fitting in with the culture of the kingdom of God on the earth. Gays have no such promise. Another law of heaven is polygamy, but there are many people who seem to say it would be optional and that heaven wouldn't be heaven with polygamy. If we are to trust the sincerity of gay couples, then heaven wouldn't be heaven for them based on a preference.   Just a thought, hope if fares well.

We all have tendencies, desires, feelings, and temptations that are contrary to the will of God. Many of these feel innate to our very nature (homosexuality, addiction, anger, etc.), and they ARE! The key to the gospel is learning to overcome these things, no matter what they are.

Since a Temple sealing is for time and all eternity, we can follow this to its logical endpoint of a man having multiple wives in the afterlife.

When I said that we had solid answers in the past, I was thinking of Joseph Smith and Lorenzo Snow.

If they ask ""do Mormons believe that they will get their own planet"" then answer ""we believe that we will become gods just like our Father, and that we will create worlds without number. So although technically the answer is yes, the real answer is a whole lot bigger than that.  And the idea of becoming gods is a caricature of the LDS faith? Since when? Do we become like God, or do we become a God just like he is? Do we become ""partakers of the divine nature"", or do we become divine?

When we become as wise and just and intelligent as He is, the same dominion will flow to us ""without compulsory means"".

Reverse the poetic nature of the couplet and ""we can be more like God"" is not at all different than ""man may become as God is.""  The first half the couplet though?  I think it is definitely believed, but it is true we don't know much about it.  Frankly, it's too bad Joseph was martyred only two months after giving the King Follett Sermon, otherwise those principles taught there might have made it into the Doctrine and Covenants."
lds,16bumm,silverfirexz,5,Fri Jan 11 04:54:11 2013 UTC,"Fun Fact: Mainstream Christianity also believes God was once a man.   While technically true, it is not at all true in the same sense. They believe in an uncreated God outside of the universe who chose to become incarnate to save us from sin and death. This isn't the same thing as believing in a deified man who sent his son to create the heavens and earth and then become incarnate. It really is a question of the origin of God--not a question of what happened in the beginning of the 1st century AD.   otherwise those principles taught there might have made it into the Doctrine and Covenants.   If he was teaching true principles, why shouldn't it have been added to the Pearl of Great Price? It's spoken more authoritatively than a lot of the canonized letters that Paul wrote. That discourse summarizes a lot of things that Joseph had been teaching in Nauvoo, and if it's true doctrine then we're ignoring some pretty important stuff.  You're right though, the second half of the couplet is a lot clearer--both in Pres. Hinckley's answers to the questions and in LDS scriptures/theology."
lds,16bumm,amertune,6,Fri Jan 11 05:04:35 2013 UTC,"I've always been taught that we will be like God. We will live the kind of life He lives. When I read the Hinckley quote, it seems to be kind of obfuscating at first, but then I think about it a bit more. What I get from it is that he isn't going to state particulars. And that's always been how it is.   Even with Joseph Smith, what he'd say is ""If you knew what it was like in just the terrestrial kingdom, you'd kill yourself to get there."" Or ""You would never believe me or couldn't understand it if I tried to tell you about the celestial kingdom."" I don't think it was Hinckley trying to say ""We don't talk about it or teach it"" but more ""We don't understand all the hows and whats."""
lds,16bumm,ThirdPoliceman,10,Fri Jan 11 00:57:33 2013 UTC,"But why not just say that? Saying, ""I don't know that we teach it,"" is a lot different than saying, ""It is a doctrine of our church, but we don't fully understand the mechanics whereby it works. We don't know all the intricacies of God's plan, but we know that God wants us to become like him.""  It's the, ""I don't know that we teach it,"" which seems dishonest, because it's deliberately choosing to sidestep the question and create obfuscations. It uses vague language to answer a yes or no question."
lds,16bumm,kayejazz,5,Fri Jan 11 03:00:50 2013 UTC,I can see that point of view. I'm just trying to say that it doesn't necessarily have to be a complete denial of the doctrine.

I dearly want to understand how other people can come away with a different interpretation of Hinckley's statement. When we're taught that lying by omission is just as bad as lying by commission, Hinckley's statement is a tough pill to swallow.   Taken at face value, ""I don't know that we teach it,"" is a pretty clear statement that eternal progression isn't a doctrine of the church, in my opinion. It takes deliberate effort to read into it, which seems like the opposite of what statements from our leaders should be. We're taught that we are a peculiar people, and that we should share the gospel and to be honest in our dealings with our fellow men, and it's disheartening when that all that goes out the window for PR or embarrassment.   I get that he never explicitly says, ""No, we don't believe that,"" but he's not standing for truth by saying, ""I don't know that we teach it.""  Again--not trying to be argumentative, and I understand if you don't want to continue the discussion on it, but I am genuinely curious. This is all very stream-of-consciousness, so I apologize if any of it comes across as offensive or otherwise argumentative.  Edit: I think what it boils down to for me is that I was taught weekly in Young Women's to ""stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things and in all places."" To me, standing as a witness of God at all times means no matter what--whether you are surrounded by people of the world or people at church, no matter what setting. At school, at work, over dinner with friends, even during an interview. And in all things means to uphold and affirm God's gospel. All of his gospel, not just the things which the world approves. And all places--again, at work, school, interviews, whatever."

lds,16bumm,jessemb,5,Fri Jan 11 19:56:25 2013 UTC,"On the first, this is descended from a comment discussing President Hinckley dissembling while addressing this very point. From the discussion, it sounds like it is very much part of our doctrine, and that President Hinckley even acknowledged that in conference shortly after his interview. Essentially, my purpose in the last comment wasn't to say that it's not doctrine, but to say that it should have been proudly proclaimed as such rather than half-denied.  On birth control, here is the official policy:   It is the privilege of married couples who are able to bear children to provide mortal bodies for the spirit children of God, whom they are then responsible to nurture and rear. The decision as to how many children to have and when to have them is extremely intimate and private and should be left between the couple and the Lord. Church members should not judge one another in this matter.  Married couples should also understand that sexual relations within marriage are divinely approved not only for the purpose of procreation, but also as a way of expressing love and strengthening emotional and spiritual bonds between husband and wife.   We are taught that we are supposed to have families, and told not to postpone having children for selfish reasons, but I have not heard of any church authorities saying that birth control is wrong in recent decades.  Compare Joseph Fielding Smith (from Doctrines of Salvation vol 2, quoted from here   BIRTH CONTROL IS WICKEDNESS. The abuse of this holy covenant has been the primary cause for the downfall of nations. When the sacred vows of marriage are broken and the real purpose of marriage abused, as we find it so prevalent in the world today, then destruction is inevitable.   to Gordon B Hinckley   Marriage is for companionship, and it is also for children. Much has been said on this campus about birth control. I like to think of the positive side of the equation, of the meaning and sanctity of life, of the purpose of this estate in our eternal journey, of the need for the experiences of mortal life under the great plan of God our Father, of the joy that is to be found only where there are children in the home, of the blessings that come of good posterity. When I think of these values and see them taught and observed, then I am willing to leave the question of numbers to the man and the woman and the Lord.   If birth control is immoral, then we should teach as much. I don't think it is (I agree with President Hinckley on this question), and church leaders no longer teach that it is (almost all of the denouncing of birth control happened in the '60s and '70s when it was new)."
lds,16bumm,Thuseld,3,Fri Jan 11 00:56:56 2013 UTC,"And could you comment on whether there is some denial of the man/god doctrine you've seen?

He could mean rhythm method, for example. Does any else think he sounds vague, wishy-washy or evasive?  JF Smith's statement is refreshingly clear and unambiguous, you must admit."

lds,16bumm,curious_mormon,24,Fri Jan 11 01:13:00 2013 UTC,"I think we need to be careful about how much knowledge we think we have on this one. From an Ensign article in 1997 (source):    Former Utah senator Jake Garn was reluctant to remarry following the death of his first wife, Hazel, in 1976, but he soon realized that he could not be both a father and a mother to his children. When he began dating Kathleen Brewerton, who would become his second wife, questions soon arose about how his first wife would feel should he become sealed to a second wife. The couple took their questions to President Spencer W. Kimball.  “He said he did not know exactly how these relationships will be worked out, but he did know that through faithfulness all will be well and we will have much joy,” Brother Garn later recalled.   I know many faithful members who do not believe polygamy to be an eternal principle (please don't send me quotes to the opposite, I am overwhelmingly aware of them). I am also aware that many women from plural marriage back in the day hoped for more in the next life:    “God will be very cruel if he does not give us poor women adequate compensation for the trials we have endured in polygamy.” - Mary Ann Angell Young, quoted in Anti-Polygamy Standard, August 1882, p. 36   With some of my own ancestors hoping for husbands of their own in the hereafter.   I know that we recently began allowing deceased women to be sealed to multiple deceased men, with the idea that it will be sorted out in the next life. (Church Handbook of Instructions 2, page 72, ""Sealing Policies"".) I'm aware of early sealing policies as adoptions to leaders rather than necessarily family units, and of the instances of polyandry though I believe sealings were still to only one husband. I'm intrigued by the allusions to Joseph offering to furnish Emma with a substitute for him, on condition that she stop her opposition to polygamy, particularly in the possible meaning of D&C 132:51-52.   I know we teach the diligent and faithful but unwed that they will be given a spouse in the next life if they cannot find one in this life.   Anyways, the whole thing is a bit of a mess, and it's apparent that some restructuring will happen after this life.   For myself, I have no problem with consensual polygamy (either polygyny or polyandry) so long as everyone is happy with the arrangement. I myself prefer monogamy and would refuse to practice polygamy without an overwhelming confirmation that I should. My wife feels the same way and I would never go against that trust.   I believe in the next life, no one will be forced to live in polygamous unions, though some may choose to. I have no problem with that. I believe the Lord will provide for us according to our righteous hearts and desires. It will all come out right.   So, just as a caution, we do not know near as much as many of us claim. There is very much about the afterlife and all of its properties that we simply do not know. We see through the glass darkly, so be careful of hard-line declarations in areas even our current prophets and apostles have not stated things definitively or consistently."

For your reference    Some people have supposed that the doctrine of plural marriage was a sort of superfluity, or non-essential, to the salvation or exaltation of mankind. In other words, some of the Saints have said, and believe, that a man with one wife, sealed to him by the authority of the Priesthood for time and eternity, will receive an exaltation as great and glorious, if he is faithful, as he possibly could with more than one. I want here to enter my solemn protest against this idea, for I know it is false. There is no blessing promised except upon conditions, and no blessing can be obtained by mankind except by faithful compliance with the conditions, or law, upon which the same is promised. The marriage of one woman to a man for time and eternity by the sealing power, according to the will of God, is a fulfillment of the celestial law of marriage in part--and is good so far as it goes--and so far as a man abides these conditions of the law, he will receive his reward therefore, and this reward, or blessing, he could not obtain on any other grounds or conditions. But this is only the beginning of the law, not the whole of it. Therefore, whoever has imagined that he could obtain the fullness of the blessings pertaining to this celestial law, by complying with only a portion of its conditions, has deceived himself. He cannot do it.     Joseph F Smith, JoD, 20:28-29"

It was something that got instituted, then stopped for the time being. For as long as it is something that I will get excommunicated for practicing, I won't worry about it. Armchair doctrine is about as useful as a comb in a bald man's pocket. The day the prophet announces that polygamy is to be reinstated will be the day it becomes something worth talking about."
lds,16bumm,Smokezero,7,Fri Jan 11 14:17:38 2013 UTC,"Polygamy is just an extension of the fundamentals of Mormonism. One who properly understands the gospel will be fully reconciled to polygamy, and indeed naturally inclined to the idea.  Also, this is incorrect:   The day the prophet announces that polygamy is to be reinstated will be the day it becomes something worth talking about.   We need to be ready beforehand. Polygamy is coming back, the sources are abundant, the truth of this is guaranteed. D&C 132:3, still canonized scripture, commands us to open our hearts to this law. The law is revealed to us even though its practice is temporarily suspended. You will be so much the better, and in a much better position to help others, if you accept this principle early instead of refusing to confront it because you find it uncomfortable. In some cases, that is an acceptable temporary refuge, but should be used only if its use is truly justified."

The point is that, according to Joseph F Smith, you aren't following the full celestial law if you aren't in a polygamous relationship.      Of course you can stay in the church.  You can stay in the church if you're a drunk, cheat a cards, smoke 10 packs a day, and curse like a sailor.  It doesn't mean the church will tell you that you're in good fellowship or that you're going to receive the fullness of the blessings in the next life."

That is a bit disingenuous. Still, I do agree that section 132 is still in the canon and OD1 doesn't refute the doctrine so much as say that God revealed the practice was to be stopped because of the circumstances. I would like a more official clarification as much as anybody. I have my own opinions on the source/divinity (or lack thereof) of polygamy but don't want to derail our discussion.

I'm not sure why it matters if someone considers themselves a ""religious adherent in the strictest sense"". I'm comfortable with people being honest with what they believe and investigating principles individually.

I'm with you on this, most quotes are something along the lines of it not being practiced  or being grounds for excommunication with a few, notably McConkie's Mormon Doctrine, insisting on polygamy being reestablished after the 2nd coming. Nothing I think would meet the standard of official disavowal (I'm sure we would have heard!) other than possibly the Larry King interview. However, the Church Newsroom (The Official resource for news media, opinion leaders, and the public - whatever that's worth) put this up a few years back:    The standard doctrine of the Church is monogamy, as it always has been, as indicated in the Book of Mormon (Jacob, chapter 2): “Wherefore, my brethren, hear me, and hearken to the word of the Lord: For there shall not any man among you have save it be one wife; and concubines he shall have none. … For if I will, saith the Lord of Hosts, raise up seed unto me, I will command my people; otherwise they shall hearken unto these things.”   A slight shift perhaps, though the ""as it always has been"" is certainly a stretch.    it is important if the rules for exaltation are different based on the generation you were born into.   Fair enough. I won't say the ""rules"" can't be different, but if they were, it would be nice to know. Regardless, I don't think anyone from any generation will be barred from exaltation over ignorance of the ""rules"".    Ignoring and refuting are two different things.   Agreed. And as I've said I am hopeful for clarification, refutation, support, whatever. I don't like ambiguity. However, the lack of appearance in manuals and lessons supposedly designed to perfect the saints at least seems to de-emphasize it. If our leaders think the polygamy doctrine is essential to salvation, I'm afraid our Sunday School classes are woefully lacking.    One can get into the temple, completing all the ordinances one requires for exaltation. The other can't. it's a religious problems if you pick the wrong ones (coffee vs caffeine for example).   Ah, that's what you meant. I don't want to open up a whole other avenue for discussion, but it is interesting how much access to the temple depends on how we judge our own standing (though obviously this varies depending on bishop/SP). For myself, I think our salvation/exaltation is much more dependent on our kindness and charity than on completing ordinances. I've known many good men and women without a temple recommend and quite a few bad men and women with a temple recommend. I imagine that doesn't go unnoticed."
lds,16bumm,smacktaix,3,Sat Jan 12 14:10:47 2013 UTC,"I'm confused as to what exactly you think needs stronger refuting.  D&C doesn't say a man has to marry more than one wife to get to the celestial kingdom.  The Joseph f. Smith quote you shared is the only thing that clearly states plural marriage is required, and I think it was simply wrong.  I don't think the church needs to go picking through every single wrong statement made by every single prophet or general authority of old to refute it.  The church's current position is very clear that you do not need polygamy to obtain the highest degree.  Rather than refute everything taught differently in the past, church leaders simply state, The living prophets words are more important than those who came before."
lds,16bumm,WooperSlim,4,Thu Jan 10 23:33:57 2013 UTC,"Part of it is I don't know how many church members actually believe it or have a true ""testimony"" of it.

lds,16bumm,jaunty_jawa,8,Thu Jan 10 23:44:17 2013 UTC,"I don't believe in the practice of polygyny as an acceptable behavior. From a socio-cultural standpoint, I understand it, and can take my objective observer stance. But when it comes to the practice in my life, if the LDS church were to reinstate it, that would probably be one of the very few things that I would cut ties forever over. To me, the ideal of one partner to share your life with is a daunting enough task. Adding multiples to that, and its just insanity, and it plays on too many social problems.  Every society that practices polygamous relationships, be it polygyny (Single Male Multi Female) or polyandry (Single Female, Multi Male) are at their core non-egalitarian with regards to gender relations. With polygamy, the benefits are always skewed toward the male of the culture, while the defects are placed squarely on the shoulders of the females.  Going back to Jacob 3:5-7 is one of the more accurate assessments, to me, of what that means. I have a hard time accepting that polygamy could EVER be a thing from God, especially a God that loves us and sees us as each unique individuals and heirs to glory. To see the potential of each soul, at least in my mind, is to see that they are worthy of a partner that they can rely on to only have eyes for them."
lds,16bumm,kayejazz,6,Fri Jan 11 00:02:14 2013 UTC,"What you decide for your own personal life is your business, but I feel like you are generalizing your feelings to a point that is critical of those who choose otherwise. It is easy to assume there is abuse, repression or inequality where there is none.  I have lived together with multiple women and was surprised at how well it works with the right personalities. You have to all be past jealousy and other such smallness (both Joseph and Muhammad knew this - not every man or woman can manage this). One of the big complaints that women in stable relationships have is lack of female companionship - having a ""sister wife"" can be a very positive thing.  There are different kinds of good relationships and different ways to do things. You can try to assume what polygyny would be like and surmise what its effects might be, but those who have taken it as a lifestyle are a bit more knowledgeable on the topic."
lds,16bumm,rilkerain,4,Fri Jan 11 00:08:49 2013 UTC,"I've mostly read studies of societies when dealing with polyamorous relationships, but on the whole, they have shown a correlation toward negative outcomes. Across culture, what we see are signs of male dominated enforcement, where emotions are played against. Women within the polygynous group tend to default to the will of the male more often than not, in a competition of sorts to see which wife is the better pleasing to the male. While this isn't always the case, this is the trend, and that is more what I look at in these cases. Certain case-studies may prove a different story, but the vast majority of the cases that have been shown tend to have signs of abuse present in larger numbers. Then there are the other aspects to examine, such as extreme age differences between the male and female members are usually present in polygynous relationships. This isn't to say that EVERY case will have this, but it is not an element I would willingly chose to live in.  That being said, while I am concerned about things like the age disparity, and the treatment of the spouse/spouses in the relationship, would I necessarily condemn someone in a relationship that was polygamous, if all parties entered into it willfully? Not at all. Even in societies where polygamous relationships are the norm, it is not something I would engage in practice, but I still do respect those within the culture as humans existing with their choices and life.   Ultimately, what I say reflects MY views, and why I Personally do not agree with polygamous lifestyles. My statement merely was that if this was vital to my participation within the religious order, I would not follow with that practice, and would probably end my ways with the group. I can study the societies that behave certain ways, do so with cultural relevance in mind, and yet still make a judgement call when it comes to my life and the things I see best in my own world. To not do so is folly."
lds,16bumm,jessemb,5,Fri Jan 11 01:07:47 2013 UTC,"Well no argument with you there. It is easy to interpret personal distaste for a lifestyle as a general critique of that lifestyle. Sounds like we are both on board with team ""live and let live"":)  Your observation on the marginalization of women in polygynous societies is astute, but you should note that any example one can point to is in a society that is severely patriarchal to start with. When women start off as inferior in a society it is only natural that they turn into cattle in marriage and lose power.  Consider how different from the historical and foreign examples a polygynous relationship with women who see themselves as men's equals and demand to be treated as such is. It is a dynamic that holds up to any modern feminist standard."
lds,16bumm,BookEmDan,3,Fri Jan 11 01:16:16 2013 UTC,"Its good that we can agree on these things. I understand your perspective, and why you felt like I was critiquing a lifestyle, so I'm glad to clear a bit of that up. Upvotes all around, you've got some good statements.  As far as the marginalization, yes, this is very much the case. The problem is that when you look at the marginalized societies, and add in these elements, like polygamy, it has a tenancy to delay the progression toward equality, and shift the perspective away from egalitarian progress, and back down the path of cattle-people. I haven't seen many studies that show the opposite, mostly because the societies that have more equal rights for women are monogamous societies."
lds,16bumm,smacktaix,3,Fri Jan 11 03:27:29 2013 UTC,"As we have both pointed out, it is hard to say much about the nature of these relationship structures from a demographic point of view - there is too much ""chicken and egg"" to it. I suspect that what matters more than a society's preferred flavor of marriage in terms of positive results is how much freedom to choose is available.  Monogamy, polyandry and polygyny both present unique challenges and provide unique benifits. I suspect what is more damaging than the harms of any single arrangement is a society that forces people into one or the other or holds one as superior. In a culture where polygyny is held up as the ideal you see people taking additional wives not because it works for them or is positive, but as a status symbol. In cultures with a taboo against poly you have people who desire the benifits of multiple companions but have to hide it or not take advantage of those opportunities.  I bet what makes for the best society is one where everyone doesn't have to be the same to ""fit in"" but can choose what works best for them and each individual regardless of gender has full rights, both legally and in practice socially. I think when people have choices they ponder more deeply their decisions in life instead of simply going with what is default."
lds,16bumm,johnybackback,2,Fri Jan 11 10:02:36 2013 UTC,"What you're describing isn't the church's typical stance from the polygamist era. It was that, ""you MUST do this or you won't be exalted"" not ""you CAN do this"".   You're also overlooking the typical characteristics of religious polygamy. It's not polygamy, which implies either polyandry or polygyny; it's polygyny only.  The restriction of polygamous marriages to one man - many women only is what let's the sexism and the repression of women in. It's what leads to the ""many wives""= high status symptom as well. If we were REALLY talking about polygamy and not just polygyny, it would be a whole different story."

Also, historically speaking, many polygamous (and polyamorous) societies exhibit greater sexual equality than nominally monogamous ones.

lds,16bumm,Wade_E,5,Fri Jan 11 02:08:03 2013 UTC,"This is not a direct response to your question but just something to think about.  While everyone commonly knows that men can be sealed to more than one women, it's lesser known that in some circumstances women can be sealed to multiple men. In cases where a woman was married to multiple men in life, the work for the dead will include sealings to each spouse. That does not mean they will live as a polyandrous family.  Another thing. You have likely heard that it is difficult for women to get sealing cancellations without having a new spouse to get sealed to. Some have misunderstood this to mean that she has to be married to a man she does not love nor want to be with. That is not the case. The sealing ordinance has a lot more blessings involved than eternal marriage. I believe that is why cancellations are ill-advised. People will not be stuck in marriages, instead they are promised a whole host of blessings, that include having a spouse. It's similar to the situation where one spouse does not remain faithful. With the faithful saint be punished because their spouse didn't live up to their covenants? No."
lds,16bumm,smacktaix,7,Fri Jan 11 02:36:46 2013 UTC,"My mother was chewing me out the other day for being non-monogamous, insisting that having more than one partner fundamentally devalues male and female union.

lds,16bumm,jessemb,7,Fri Jan 11 17:37:37 2013 UTC,"The only area where we currently practice polygamy is that we can remarry after the death of a wife, and we still consider the first marriage valid.  Although marriages in other faiths are ""to death do you part,"" from my experience most lay people believe that they will be with their families when they die.  In fact, I once read a protestant pastor's rebuttal to our interpretation of the phrase, that ""to death do you part,"" doesn't mean you divorce at death, but merely that they have permission to remarry if one of them dies.  It should probably be considered as ""serial polygamy"" but if no one else considers a ""one wife at a time"" belief as polygamy, why should we?"
lds,16bumm,smacktaix,12,Fri Jan 11 18:17:20 2013 UTC,"Polygamous unions are also allowed in the case of divorce. If an LDS couple divorces and the man wants to marry a new wife in the temple, he is allowed to do so without having his first marriage ""annulled"" (not sure of the actual term).

I, personally think I would live it if asked.  I'm also very familiar with the idea that there will be polygamous marriages in the Celestial Kingdom. It's in the D&C in several places, including section 132. There are many who advocate that every one will be in a polygamous relationship in heaven. Others say that while some will definitely live in plural marriage, not everyone will be required to. I haven't yet decided which of those two camps I fall in. It goes back and forth.  If someone asks me, I simply say it is a teaching of the church that we are not currently living. If they inquire further, I discuss situations like Elder Oaks.

In context, it was a very personal revelation, with Joseph and Emma specifically and repeatedly mentioned.  It's possible that the requirements mentioned in verse 27 and 32 were meant specifically for JS, or perhaps his era. I know I don't feel as if I've made a covenant to be a polygamist, especially when the old Section 101 labeled it as optional, for both men and women:    ""Inasmuch as this Church of Christ has been reproached with the crime of fornication and polygamy, we declare that we believe that one man should have one wife, and one woman but one husband, except in the case of death, when either is at liberty to marry again."" -D&C 101:4, History of the Church, vol. 2, pg. 247   In greater context with other scriptures, especially Book of Mormon scriptures, polygamy is explicitly condemned. Combined with the D&C teachings, the lesson likely is that it's condemned unless it is commanded.  Seeing as we're currently in a polygamy condemnation period and not a polygamy commandment period, those two verses are awfully thin to believe there is an irrefutable requirement to eternally practice polygamy.

There is no reason to believe otherwise, and lots of reason to believe this is so.   do you imagine the Lord will rob many great leaders of their eternal wives?   It depends on what you mean by ""rob"". Joseph Smith demonstrated that God sometimes does get in the business of rearranging marriages. If the people were humble, this would all be for the greater good, but as the experience with JS shows, most people are not sufficiently humble to allow this kind of ""interference"" from the Lord their God. Surely the Lord knows better than us if it is prudent to continue living with a certain individual for the rest of our mortal lives or whatever. We should gratefully accept it when the prophet comes and asks us for our wives, children, or any other thing, and our only response should be ""Hallelujah! I only regret that I do not have more to give"".  If we understand husband/wife dynamics in the eternities, even polyandrous relationships make sense. I don't believe the Lord sees things as rigidly as we do. There will be rearrangement and modification indeed, but not modification for the sake of monogamy (at least not as a reward), as monogamy is nothing more than the limitation of a kingdom."

So again, I'm not sure what is meant by believing in a principle.  In reality, because of the easy access of divorce, most of the world practices polygamy."
lds,16bumm,kayejazz,2,Fri Jan 11 15:56:38 2013 UTC,"Because the attitude still persists that ""Polygamy is icky.""  If the Lord wants to ""raise a people up unto him,"" then he'll command us to enter into the practice again.  And if (as some believe, and may be true) it is essential for exaltation, then that will need to be sorted out as well.  However, if plural marriage in this life were necessary for exaltation, I don't see a situation in which the Lord would ever have stopped the practice.  Brigham Young preached that if you can't accept the doctrine of polygamy, then you can't be exalted.  It's important for us to be humble, meek, and submissive to the will of our Father.  It is the nature of mortality that we aren't going to like everything the Lord has to say to us.  We have to take the bad with the good, until our test is over.  It saddens me when people talk about how the idea of plural marriage ""sickens them,"" declaring that they refuse to be exalted in the face of that doctrine.  Then, in the next breath, they moan about how awful it is that the Church just can't accept homosexual unions.  Priorities are a little reversed, there."

lds,16bumm,curious_mormon,4,Fri Jan 11 16:12:54 2013 UTC,"Right, but my point is that historically we've seen practices discontinued even though they are correct doctrinally and necessary for eternal progression. So it isn't unbelievable for polygamy to be discontinued even though it, too, is doctrinally correct and necessary for eternal progression."
lds,16bumm,Levago,2,Fri Jan 11 17:18:47 2013 UTC,I think the fundamentalists actually do have a good case within LDS doctrine as taught by the founding prophets that the current mainstream church is in apostacy for their rejection of the principle. There is a reason the polygamists are able to recruit from the devout believers.
lds,16bumm,curious_mormon,2,Fri Jan 11 17:23:05 2013 UTC,It's true.
lds,16bumm,bradg,2,Fri Jan 11 16:25:58 2013 UTC,"I think there are two issues I grapple with here. I have two lenses that I use to understand polygamy, and I'm not sure either one are the truth. They are just the best explanations I've heard that seem to mesh with what I understand of revealed doctrine.  The first deals with polygamy as an Abrahamic sacrifice. Very interesting opinion, in my view. When the church stopped viewing it as a sacrifice and instead as a privilege, it was revoked.   How this squares with my understanding of sealings is that perhaps polygamy will not be allowed in the eternities, and multiple sealings are one of the things that will be corrected in the millenium as we learn more. As a good friend once put it to me, she thought heaven would be a place where everyone experiences perfect love with everyone. Having someone I used to be in love with sealed to someone else for eternity is a hard concept for me to swallow in order to feel like a heaven to me. Either we'll progress past that point, or we'll learn to love people we are with either way. I think there is a lot we just don't understand about that whole system.  The second view is nearly completely contradictory to the first. I can't remember where I first read about it (source would be appreciated if anyone can direct me there!) but it was essentially arguing that since prophets aren't perfect, God really never authorized polygamy. It was just part of the early church leaders stumbling and trying to understand eternal marriage in the first place. It was a very nuanced argument, but it was strikingly convincing without casting doubt on the inspiration of the prophets - in fact, it made it all seem more realistic to me.   Either way, since we don't know why polygamy was originally practiced (and we don't. Anyone who says otherwise is speculating), we can't say if we still believe it or not.   I, for one, wish the prophets would address this. It has been over 100 years since the manifesto, and the fact that it is still being discussed and is still such a large reason that many people will never seriously investigate the church tells me that new news would be good. If Joseph Smith could get revelations on what certain scriptures meant, or when someone asked him a question, surely the prophets today could ask."

lds,16bumm,luckymcduff,1 point,Fri Jan 11 16:43:50 2013 UTC,"Because polygamy is not a saving ordinance. It is not required of the LDS in order to get into heaven.  Another point: Any married unit may ultimately decide whether or not to stay together after death. For example, no woman is bound to a man who treated her poorly in life. While I don't have the exact source, the Joseph Smith character says this in that Joseph Smith: The Prophet movie that you can watch at Temple Square.  Some perfectly righteous members never get married, perhaps ones that even struggle with gender attraction issues.  My point is, I think there's going to be a lot of sorting out going on in the next life."
lds,16bumm,vitras,-2,Fri Jan 11 14:15:00 2013 UTC,It is clear that polygamy is an eternal principle and will be practiced in the hereafter. It does not do to give more fodder to enemies of the church. That is why we do not discuss it at length.

I understand it's a sensitive issue due to various factors, and the Church has basically stricken a balance where they completely ignore it ever existed. I think ultimately this is for the better. Certain factions, I agree, can feel a little bristling at this, but on the large scale, if we appeared subversive and frequently preached ""we are going to be polygamous just as soon as we can, and you can suck it"", our issues would be much worse.  We must remember that the leaders of the Church must be harmless as doves and wise as serpents as they go about attempting to preach the gospel and gather Israel up from among the Gentiles. This is also why the Church has complied with other social norms that are outside of the ideal, like the existing policy on haircuts."

One point of clarification, I do NOT believe that a snapshot of LDS beliefs is equivalent to scientific understanding nor do I believe that science will always agree with a snapshot of doctrine. The two operate independently and with different methodologies. However, I DO believe that the LDS faith has the right ingredients to allow it to evolve along side increasing knowledge coming through science.  Much of my faith in religious/scientific reconciliation comes from my faith in an open canon and on-going revelation which allows the church to evolve even if it doesn't evolve in the same way or time as science."

You bring up a good point, in order to know the beginning from the end you'd need a computing system that was, well, as big as the universe itself.  But that leaves me to conjecture that:  1) Strict interpretations of omniscient or omnipresence are false.  or  2) God exists or has access to something outside the universe or in dimensions where such knowledge of our universe is feasible. That would not preclude Him from interacting in our space/time. If God exists above our space/time He could very well know the end from the beginning and perform physical acts which we would observe as violating laws of space and time in the dimensions we understand.

I would love to be a fly on the wall for a conversation between you two, but I don't think either party could come to a definitive answer. I don't see a way that science can prove or disprove religion because so much of religion is unfalsifiable. It's virtually impossible to disprove God because theologians can always create a new explanation that ""meshes"" with science while still lying beyond the realm of current testable data."
lds,16c8zk,Antonton,0,Fri Jan 11 05:07:30 2013 UTC,"Well proving/disproving God in general is impossible, granted.  However, a corporeal God who is also omnipotent and omniscient is a special case.    One simple example.  A corporeal God cannot physically be in two places at once.  A violation of omnipotence.  Omniscience  Omniscience - like mentioned above, you can't fit all the information in the universe into a human skull.  Information theory tells us that the storage of information requires space.  The most efficient way to store all the information in the universe is the universe itself.  Just as the most accurate representation of an banana is a banana.   Storing a perfect model of the universe, aside from the universe itself, would take orders of magnitude more space than the universe, and you still have the problems of how to observe the universe and keep the model in lockstep synchronization with it; and also how to affect any given point in space with your godly powers.  Assume that you do have all the above, a sort of meta-universe on top and woven into our universe for the purpose of controlling it.  Well, to be omniscient, then God would have to know everything about this meta-universe as well, necessitating a meta-meta-universe ad infinitum.  The most logical way around these is to restrict the sense of the words omniscience and omnipotence; which is almost necessary, because 'Man was in the beginning with God' and intelligences are not created.  The fact that intelligences exist outside of God and have free agency means that God cannot be truly omnipotent, because we have some power too.  Prophecy  However this causes a problem with prophecy.  Consider the level of prophecy in the Book of Mormon.  Exact quotes from Acts, Matthew, populations being called Christians before the birth of Christ.  The thing is, there's also the belief in free agency.  Consider a quote from Acts in the Book of Mormon.  There's no doubt that specific occurrences in Paul's life led him, through his own choices (as well as the obvious incident of divine intervention) to being a highly lettered persecutor, then advocate for Christians.  His tremendous skill with words is his, his word choices no doubt came to him through a long series of decisions, made freely, with elements of chance, that were deeply influenced by his own personal history and choice.  Yet those precise words (in many cases along with the precise word choice in the KJV) come out in the Book of Mormon, long before Paul was born.    Did Paul, then, choose those words, as they existed on another continent before he was born?  If he did not choose those words then he had no agency.  Free agency precludes exact knowledge of the near future, and precludes most knowledge of the distant future—by anyone, God included.  However, the God of Mormonism has often known the future in exacting detail.  The thing is, if God does not know the future, then he's not very God-like."

lds,16c8zk,Antonton,1 point,Sat Jan 12 00:20:45 2013 UTC,"You make some really interesting points. From a believers perspective, though, I still really have no issue in making this fit.   Omniscience - like mentioned above, you can't fit all the information in the universe into a human skull.   True, but who said all of God's knowledge is stored in one place? Why can't he use a cloud system? Can God not use the entire universe as His permanent desk reference?   Just as the most accurate representation of an banana is a banana.   I would disagree with you there. A banana has all the information it needs to be a banana in one sequence of DNA, which can be found in one cell. One cell is clearly a negligible percentage of the whole banana, and yet, we could take that one cell and recreate a whole banana.  I see what you're getting at, and perhaps I can see this working out because I'm a biochemistry student, but could there not be some equivalent for the universe? Some compact storage system that, when accessed with the right tools (in the case of life, transcription and translation machinery) is expanded into something much greater? An incredibly small portion of the banana is actually information; most of it is just raw material that the information has organized.   The fact that intelligences exist outside of God and have free agency means that God cannot be truly omnipotent, because we have some power too.   It's my belief that God ""stays His hand"" to allow us free agency. He could interact if He wanted to, but chooses not to for our own benefit. There's a much deeper discussion here on God and agency, but I don't think that God's power and our free agency are mutually exclusive. That would imply that we have power over God, which I do not believe.   Did Paul, then, choose those words, as they existed on another continent before he was born? If he did not choose those words then he had no agency.   I see two possibilities here.   Joseph Smith, in his translation, some ideas very similar if not identical to something he had read in Acts. He decided to use those words because, for all intents and purposes, those words were ""perfect"", so there's no need to reinvent the wheel. (Sidenote, what scriptures are you referring to?) The two authors were independently inspired by the same source to use the same language.   Either way, I see no problem. Case 1, Paul's words truly were unique so the point is invalidated. Case 2, Paul received help from an external source in his word choice, absolutely, but does that negate his agency? By your logic, anytime we accept ideas, suggestions, or recommendations from someone else that we had never had, we forfeit our agency. I find that notion preposterous.   Free agency precludes exact knowledge of the near future, and precludes most knowledge of the distant future—by anyone, God included.   I can see that, and you definitely have a point. But what if there exists a being who has eons of experience in observation and predicting?  For instance, a car comes flying at you down the street. You know, based on previous experience and observation, that you need to move because you ""know the near future"" in that you know the car will collide with you if you don't do something. A baby does not know that because it lacks experience and foresight.  Another example slightly more akin to what I imagine God does. Take a man who hasn't had anything to eat in 3 days. Place some food in front of him. He will eat. Our understanding of human nature tells us he will eat.  Now, there could be some exceptions to this, of course. What if he wants to starve to death? What if we give him steak and he has a strong moral opposition to eating meat, so strong that even after 3 days of starvation he will not consume?  I believe there to be a finite number of attributes that can be combined in an individual and a finite number of situational characteristics that we can be placed in. The application is perhaps infinite, but the principles, I think, of human interaction in a given circumstance, can be understood by a being who truly knows the personality inside and out of the subject and who understand all stimuli and conditions of an event.  TL;DR: You'll notice I used words like ""think"" and ""believe"" a lot. We don't know enough about the nature of God (or not enough definitive statements have been made about his supposed qualities) in order to prove or disprove anything. It comes down to your personal interpretation of omnipresence, omnipotence, agency, and God. I have no problem, even with my knowledge of science, seeing how those can all fit. I can also see, however, how for some there would definitely be conflicts."

A banana has all the information it needs to be a banana in one sequence of DNA   I disagree here, and this is a key point, I think.  DNA is generative, but DNA isn't sufficient to describe a banana any more than your DNA is sufficient to describe who you are.  If I ask God, will my kids eat this banana or is it too bruised?  He can't tell me based on the DNA.  Every model (including DNA) omits information, and therefore is, at some level, false.  There's a saying in computer science (probably in all the science) that 'all models are wrong, some are useful.'  Categories (such as banana) are an artifact of the way the human brain works—and it's an efficient way to organize information; but outside of the human brain, such categories don't exist in nature.    Imagine that you slowly change the DNA of a banana into an apple.  At what point do you start producing apples and not bananas or created something else entirely?  It's like the heap paradox, which is a paradox only because of our need to categorize the sand as a heap or not a heap.   For instance, a car comes flying at you down the street. You know, based on previous experience and observation, that you need to move because you ""know the near future"" in that you know the car will collide with you if you don't do something.   Going further with this, let's say that a very, very slight deviation in the car's course 10 meters before means the difference between you surviving and you dying.  If you die, your children will never be born.  Their children and grand children will never be born.  That effects of that tiny deviation in the car's course are vastly amplified by time.  One of the most humbling 'epiphanies' I've had, I think, is the realization that the tiniest of causes can have enormous effects in some cases, while some large-scale events can have little impact at all.  It's counter-intuitive and terrifying.  Sometimes these causes can be pure (quantum) chance.  Imagine a man who wins a million dollars in Vegas at a slot machine with a hardware random number generator.  Buys a Ferrari, gets wasted, gets behind the wheel and hits you:   For instance, a car comes flying at you down the street.   And then, the rest of the story ;)  Anyhow, I've rambled long enough.

lds,16c8zk,Wade_E,1 point,Fri Jan 11 02:17:31 2013 UTC,"there was no death on this planet prior to approximately 6,000 years ago. Plainly untrue, there has been death for billions of years.   I agree, there definitely was death prior to 6,000 years ago. Ever since there was life on this planet (~3.6 billion years ago), there has been death. That's a cornerstone of evolution (life, procreation, mutation, and natural selection). I go to the temple regularly and have read and re-read the creation account many times and the more I learn about the evolution of our biology, planet, solar system, galaxy, etc. the more I see that a pedantic and literal interpretation simply disrespects the intent of that account. It also makes me see how some of the descriptions could be referencing significant solar/planetary milestones in their evolution not obvious by a literal meaning.   Then you can try the global flood, Lamanite DNA, our sun getting its light from Kolob etc. and you will see a great disconnect between science and the LDS Church.   I know that the Pearl of Great Price says that ""our sun [gets/got] its light from Kolob"". Science teaches that our star is a 2nd or 3rd generation star, meaning it got its raw material from the super-nova of past stars. It could be that another star mentioned in scriptures is/was one of those stars (just a thought). Maybe Kolob is the center of the galaxy and ""light"" means direction (gravity). Maybe it has something to do with the big bang. I don't know. ""Light"" here could mean almost anything. That word is used liberally throughout the scriptures in many different ways.  But to be fair, I don't know the answers to all this. Science certainly illuminates things (age of the earth, evolution, DNA, gravitational fusion, etc. etc.). What that simply means is that a literal and pedantic interpretation of these things is not accurate. However, we can't go about hanging the validity of everything in the gospel on some remark made about something that someone may or may not have fully understood. That's precisely what a hasty generalization is. And doing so, whether it be about religion or science, can only lead to nihilism.  Remember, the basics of the gospel are the pillars that the church stands on (faith/repentance/baptism/Holy Ghost/Atonement/Priesthood/Temples/Eternal Families). I could care less about something some church leader said about what they thought about a non-gospel related topic. It's interesting, but not my testimony, and I'm not obligated to believe it.  One of my favorite quotes from Elder James E. Talmage in my study of the religion/science dynamic:   ""Let us not try to wrest the scriptures in an attempt to explain away what we cannot explain. The opening chapters of Genesis, and scriptures related thereto, were never intended as a text-book of geology, archaeology, Earth-science or man-science. . . . We do not show reverence for the scriptures when we misapply them through faulty interpretation.""   Here's a longer one from St. Augustine (De Genesi ad Litteram I, xix, 39) from 400-ish AD:   Usually, even a non-Christian knows something about the earth, the heavens, and the other elements of this world, about the motion and orbit of the stars and even their size and relative positions, about the predictable eclipses of the sun and moon, the cycles of the years and the seasons, about the kinds of animals, shrubs, stones, and so forth, and this knowledge he hold to as being certain from reason and experience. Now, it is a disgraceful and dangerous thing for an infidel to hear a Christian, presumably giving the meaning of Holy Scripture, talking nonsense on these topics; and we should take all means to prevent such an embarrassing situation, in which people show up vast ignorance in a Christian and laugh it to scorn. The shame is not so much that an ignorant individual is derided, but that people outside the household of faith think our sacred writers held such opinions, and, to the great loss of those for whose salvation we toil, the writers of our Scripture are criticized and rejected as unlearned men. If they find a Christian mistaken in a field which they themselves know well and hear him maintaining his foolish opinions about our books, how are they going to believe those books in matters concerning the resurrection of the dead, the hope of eternal life, and the kingdom of heaven, when they think their pages are full of falsehoods and on facts which they themselves have learnt from experience and the light of reason? Reckless and incompetent expounders of Holy Scripture bring untold trouble and sorrow on their wiser brethren when they are caught in one of their mischievous false opinions and are taken to task by those who are not bound by the authority of our sacred books. For then, to defend their utterly foolish and obviously untrue statements, they will try to call upon Holy Scripture for proof and even recite from memory many passages which they think support their position, although they understand neither what they say nor the things about which they make assertion.   For me, it boils down to covenants. Even if some church leader said something about a topic, I always refer back to my covenants.   Have I covenanted to believe that the earth is 6,000 years old or that evolution didn't occur? Nope. Have I covenanted to believe something particular about ancient native American DNA? Nope. Have I covenanted to believe that the sun emits photons it only received from some other entity in space? Nope. Have I covenanted to be a republican? Nope. Have I covenanted to be a democrat? Nope. Etc. etc. etc.   This is the balance that I've come to find that allows me to reconcile my faith with the continued discoveries of science. Both are evolving (church through continued revelation and faith; and science through experimentation and theory). It is crucial to distill the truths from either and accept those in humility as they are applied to bring about good.  I hope this doesn't sound too overly apologetic. My desire here isn't to say that the church is infallible or that church leaders have never said something false. It's just that by humbly looking for the truth and letting go of only the things that are in and of themselves not accurate do you progress; whether it be in religion, science, or both.

No, this is official church doctrine, you cannot get away with that, trying to maintain it is not doctrine is denying the very church you are defending... Latter-day revelation teaches that there was no death on this earth for any forms of life before the fall of Adam.

You pointing to 2 Ne. 2:22 is well taken. That scripture (again interpreted literally), does fly in the face of well established science from multiple disciplines; and many members and leaders have fallen on different sides of interpretation on this.  However, that literal interpretation, even if held by many members of the church and even some leaders, does not make it doctrine.

This is a question that has generated much discussion within the Church, with strong opinions held on both sides. In the late 1920s and early 1930s Elder B. H. Roberts, senior president of the First Council of Seventy, wrote and spoke extensively of his beliefs concerning pre-Adamites and death among plant and animal life before the fall. His views were strongly opposed by Elder Joseph Fielding Smith of the Quorum of the Twelve. Elder Smith's arguments centered on the passage from 2 Nephi 2:22 that if Adam had not fallen, ""all things which were created must have remained in the same state in which they were after they were created; and they must have remained forever, and had no end."" Each attempted to have his views confirmed by the church. Both Elder Roberts and Elder Smith formally presented their views to the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve. After careful consideration, the First Presidency issued a report. Dated 5 April 1931 and addressed to the Council of the Twelve, the First Council of the Seventy, and the Presiding Bishopric, the report stated: ""Neither side of the controversy has been accepted as doctrine at all.""26 Thus, the First Presidency made it clear that the Church has no official stand concerning the existence of pre-Adamites and death among plants and animals before the fall... It is important here to stress that although there may have been death among plants and animals before the fall, this does not apply to Adam and Eve. The scriptures and the teaching of the Brethren make it absolutely clear that before the fall Adam and Eve were not yet subject to death, and it was only by partaking of the forbidden fruit that they became mortal.   My main point in this post (which to be honestly I didn't do a good job of in the OC--I've mostly just clarified it my comments) is that the church has the right ingredients to be compatible with science through continued revelation. The article above does a very good job of explaining the openess to scriptural interpretation and exploration of the church's official positions on these matters."

The religion department teches counterfactually about some aspects of Church history, but again, that is the religion department - the real classes were real classes as far as I could tell. In general, my professors were well-credentialed in their fields. I feel like most of them let their values influence their teaching, but not their dogma.

In other words, sometimes it is necessary to violate a general rule due to unforeseen circumstances, or for the greater good.  So if your ox falls in the mud on the Sabbath day, better to get him out now than let him die just because you don't want to work on the Sabbath.  A modern example would be not wanting to spend money on the Sabbath, but buying gas on a road trip on Sunday."

The doctor was prescribing alcohol as an anesthetic while he performed an experimental (and painful) operation.

lds,16bofm,DesolationRobot,3,Thu Jan 10 20:24:47 2013 UTC,"So true. So, so true. In fact, I think it's a stretch (harkening back to the thread from a few weeks ago on doctrine vs. culture) to say ""alcohol = sin"". Disobeying council from the Lord or His anointed = sin, but there's nothing inherently sinful about alcohol. You could argue that there is something inherently sinful about drunkenness, of course. But the Bible and even Section 89 seem to take a moderate pro-alcohol position.   Not that I think anyone should drink--especially not LDS. But we shouldn't give in to revisionist history, either.  On the other hand, I don't think that doctor's orders give you carte blanche to do whatever you want. If a doctor prescribed me medical marijuana I'd be tempted, but I'd probably stick with, ""I'm not comfortable with that."""

May I present Moses, just after receiving the 10 commandments, coming down the mountain and killing a bunch of guys? Or the supposed genocide of the Amalekites? (I say supposed because a couple of 'em show up later)  The key thing is to be worthy to have the spirit with you. Personal revelation exists for a reason, so that in the moment you can know if it's okay to do X or not. Though, I think that doing such behavior to protect your customers, whatever that means is probably not a good excuse. God and Mammon and all that."
lds,16bofm,panserbjorner,3,Sat Jan 12 01:24:59 2013 UTC,"So if the spirit okay's you doing something aweful, then its okay? The problem with using the Spirit as moral justification/cover, is that history is repleat with examples of people who claim that God okayed bad behavior. Case in point: the 1984 killings by the Laftery Brothers.   Anytime the Spirit is used to justify immoral behavior (i.e. killing, theft) or even breaking a minor commandment, a moral delimia exists and there exists no objective test to know if is in fact the will of God. When the commandment/law broken has a consquence of high severity, then this moral delimia becomes amplified.   The last thing that people need to be told is that its okay to do something because they felt okay about it. Rather, if you feel like God wants you to do something, it should be checked against what is moral, legal and ethical first."

This is not an excuse, and doesn't necessarily mitigate any repercussions, but I think is an explanation for someones behavior."

However, if they know they have done righteously, then they shouldn't have a problem facing their (perhaps unjust) punishment.   There is no objective way to know if anything is right or wrong, except perhaps direct revelation (though it could be argued that this is subjective, due to it being god's opinion of right v. Wrong)   Morality, legality and ethics are no more objectively true than an individual's belief that they have received revelation. If we're not counting supposed revelation, then why are killing and stealing and whatever wrong? Because we choose to believe they are.

Knowledge of right and wrong, does not preclude the test to life. There are plenty of cases where someone knows something is wrong and still does it. Further, there is scriptural examples -- the devils who came out of the swine, Satan and his host, Cain, etc -- of people who had a direct knowledge that what they were/are doing was/is wrong.   Also, I don't know where the idea that knowledge of God precludes agency. That, AFAIK, has no basis in scriptures. Again, citing my example above, once can have direct knowledge of God, and still choose counter.   If the purpose of life is to be tested, knowing that God exists, does not  affect agency; you are still free to choose to follow God or someone else. The test is the degree to which you follow him, not whether you first choose to belief first. If anything, it would make the test more fair: then people would know they are being tested."

Simply because we would absolutely be sure of the rewards for following said rules, and there would be no room for doubt.   How would He set up these objective rules anyway? Other than showing up to everyone and saying 'HEY! I EXIST! THESE ARE MY RULES! BYE!' That would then seem to be a bit unfair, no?

lds,16bofm,Levago,1 point,Thu Jan 10 22:05:35 2013 UTC,"I think God's system always relies on morality.  When Nephi killed Laban, what he did was objectively moral: he was killing one man to save an entire nation.  Killing Hitler would be moral for the same reasons.  Similarly, it is the moral thing to lie sometimes.  (Example: In Sound of Music when the nuns tell the Nazis that the Von Trapp family is not in the abbey, it was the moral thing to tell the Nazis a lie in order to save the family; it would have been the WRONG thing to tell the truth.)  So obviously the default rule is in place, but morality trumps the default rule."

He didn't pose a real threat to Nephi or to any actual living person at the time; that nation did not even exist. Also, since Lehi and his family had no right to the plates in the first place, you have created a morally problematic situation: you can kill someone in order to obtain something that will save more people. That's really scary. Given that Laban was drunk, why did he have to kill him? Couldn't God had simply made him sleep, or even better, if his death was required, why didn't God have a cat run infront of Laban, causing him to trip and break his neck? My point is that the story that is cited as the reason why we should follow the Spirit and the commandments, is a story that is morally problematic. There is no morality understood now, or then, that would have excused the actions of Nephi. Nephi and his family, were not under any threat. And under the law of war, Nephi was not justified in taking the life of Laban.   With your logic, killing an apostate would be justified to prevent their progreny from suffering under unbelief.  That's scary."

These nurses would have done nothing wrong in getting a vaccine, at least from a doctrinal perspective. If they personally believe otherwise, that's fine, but there's no definitive commandment they can point to that would forbid them from doing so, so it wouldn't be a sin. They might believe it's wrong or whatever, and I would argue that not getting a vaccine is faith without works, but that's a discussion for a different time, and the fact of the matter is that getting a vaccine is not a sin.  That's not so with wine. Currently, we do have a specific commandment that tells us not to drink alcohol. Could a situation arise where the Spirit gives us permission? Perhaps. Nephi and Laban comes to mind. I can't really think of a situation where drinking wine would save a nation, but maybe Nephi never thought of a situation where killing a man would do the same.  That's why we have personal revelation. If I were a betting man, I would say that situation (where the Spirit approves wine consumption) would not present itself, especially since I imagine it would be easy for someone to convince themselves that drinking wine is okay because the Spirit told them so when really that's not the case."

I also believe that you can't subject it to a reducto ad absurdim: had the dignitary invited him to a brothel, I'm sure he would have declined.  I like this story because, like OP's original question, it shows that the answer to ""what does God want me to do?"" isn't always so simple."
lds,16bofm,everything_is_free,2,Thu Jan 10 21:49:36 2013 UTC,"Good question. The difficulty in life is that many of the choices we are faced with are not simply between good and evil but between competing goods or competing evils. This was the type of dilemma faced by Adam and Eve. Deliberating and then acting in the face of the dilemma was how they became wise and gained real, affective, and profound ""knowledge of good and evil.""  It is the same for us. In many cases there are no clear cut answers. Instead, we must ""choose for [our]selves."" This is why we are here. This is the type of wisdom we could not simply learn in the presence of the Father."

lds,16bofm,Wade_E,2,Fri Jan 11 09:06:00 2013 UTC,"The key thing to remember is what we have covenanted to do and not do.  For the broad question, ""When is it okay to sin?"" I answer ""Never."" It's never okay to willfully do something you know to be wrong since that will always weaken your soul and deafen your sensitivity to the spirit. It is okay, however, to not blindly follow tradition or culture even when many view doing so as ""sinful"". But I find those who go against tradition or culture just for the sake of it to be tiring. Find a good cause and follow it, don't rebel just for the sake of rebelling.  However, we must be careful to 1) never attach a sin to a person (including ourselves) and 2) differentiate between culture and gospel. #1 is solved by having genuine empathy and appreciation for others and #2 is solved by educating yourself about the gospel and covenants you've made. It boils down to covenants and following the spirit. Covenants and the gospel are lifeless without the spirit to direct us on how to apply them in our lives.  BTW the:   ""God made our bodies perfect and that if we take care of it the right way, it will take care of us""    ...idea is patently false. The myriad number of birth defects and diseases fly in the face of that idea. Nurses, of all people, should know this. God gave us bodies as tools to use to grow our spirits and become like Him. Nowhere does it state that our tools are perfect (in fact quite the opposite). That's just intellectual laziness or dishonesty on their part.  The anti-vaccine movement is a bit of a grey area for me. On one hand, I want to respect people's beliefs. But on the other, herd immunity shows that unwillingness or inability to vaccinate by even 6% of the population allows diseases like measles and pertussis to keep a foothold. At 15% diseases like diphtheria, mumps, smallpox, polio, and rubella follow suit.  We do not make decisions in a vacuum and our decisions have very real consequences on those around us who may not be able to vaccinate for medical reasons. I'm fine with medical facilities requiring it when there is sound medical justification to require it."

lds,16ayup,joshthephysicist,15,Thu Jan 10 07:52:53 2013 UTC,"Sounds interesting, I wish I was closer and could attend. I hope the discussion is something along the lines of:    Don't assume they just want to sin. This forces on them a definition of sin they likely do not share. Discrediting their character instead of understanding their thought process and reasoning is a thinly veiled ad hominem.  Don't assume they were just offended or overly sensitive. This places all the blame on the individual and invalidates their experience. People leave without being offended and people leave justifiably offended, let's not pretend they don't.  Don't discount, ignore, or marginalize their reasons (if they decide to share). It is very belittling of us to treat someone who has made a life decision such as this as merely foolish or misguided. I know I hate it when I am met with similar dismissal for choosing to follow the Mormon faith. We can disagree but not insult.  Don't badger, bargain, blackmail, constantly bemoan, or blame them for ruining your afterlife. Salvation is an individual proposition. No man can be forced to heaven. If they don't want every conversation to center on the topic don't force it.  Don't gossip or talk about them behind their back. This one should be obvious.  Do continue to live as we see fit according to the gospel. The most convincing aspect of its truth is the effect on our lives.  Do invite and include them as before. We do not need to agree on everything to spend time together. However, avoid making them a project or having some ulterior motive.  Do be ready and willing to discuss, bear testimony, share experiences, etc. if they desire to talk about it.  Do try to be accommodating and accepting of their beliefs while maintaining our standards. In my experience, doing so is usually not too difficult.  Do love them thoroughly. Let them know, both by word and by action.    Note that to some extent this assumes a relationship between two adults, not parent-child. Most are probably still applicable but the dynamic is undeniably changed."

lds,16ayup,aarontrout,13,Thu Jan 10 11:33:22 2013 UTC,"The other thing to remember is that many LDS members are incapable or unwilling to understand the reasons for apostasy. Please don't take this personally...hear me out.   Our world-view -- the way that we approach the world, see the world, and see how things interact -- is colored by our believes and experiences. As people apostatize, their world-view is often up-ended and changes. So unless members try to understand the apostate's world-view, both will spend fruitless hours talking past each other.   The fact is that when you see through the eyes of faith, it becomes harder to understand the reasons why someone leaves; your world, the way you see your world, and the way you understand the world, becomes fundamentally different from that of the one who has left."

The fact is that understanding someone, and making them understand you, often takes work and empathy, not just logical persuasion.  Work especially, when that empathy comes with difficulty.

lds,16a33l,C0unt_Z3r0,4,Thu Jan 10 02:33:35 2013 UTC,"This thread is somewhat prompted by the ""Why is faith a virtue?"" thread by /u/LDSatheist.  I found this talk, and thought that it was pretty good. You can really find some gems in 30+ year old Ensigns :)  He discusses three levels of dealing with ambiguity:   We simply do not—perhaps cannot—even see the problems that exist (optimists) You see things for what they are (pessimists) We not only view things with our eyes wide open, but with our hearts wide open as well (improvers)   Anyway, to the point: I feel that I've become really good at level two, but I don't know how to move on to level three or even if I can. One thing that I keep coming back to is the question of whether or not you can choose what you believe. Any counsel/advice/commiseration?"
lds,16a33l,onewatt,2,Wed Jan 9 23:55:59 2013 UTC,"I remember for a lot of my life, things just seemed ""unreal"" or like they didn't fit together. I feel this is sort of like writer's block, in that it's not something you just need to press through but a sign that something's fundamentally wrong and you aren't considering something.  I don't think you can choose what makes sense to you, but if things don't make sense right now you can take that as a pain or warning signal and try to find out why."
lds,16a33l,theCroc,2,Thu Jan 10 08:35:50 2013 UTC,"I'll rephrase this using my own terminology.   Three levels of dealing with ambiguity:    We close our temporal eye.   We refuse to see the problems that exist in the 'real world.' We insist that the things we've been taught are true. etc. Claims like ""Evolution is a complete lie!"" would fit here, in my opinion.   We close our spiritual eye.   We refuse to admit to any spirituality, both now as well as in our past. We gauge all of our experience through the lens of 'the real,' making no room for spiritual interpretations. Claims like ""How can God be real if ___"" fit here.   We use both perspectives to arrive at truth.    As Elder Hafen says, we recognize flaws, but we aren't stumped by them. When the spiritual fails to satisfy our needs, we turn to the temporal. When the temporal fails, we turn to the spiritual. When they conflict, we continue to study both perspectives. Instead of saying ""Evolution is false,"" we ask ""How does evolution fit into the plan?"" Instead of saying ""Why would God __"" rhetorically, as if that disproved his existence, we ask the same question, but in really wanting to know.  A key to the third methodology is patience. It simply takes time to arrive at a pleasing, stereoscopic view on certain topics. Years and years. That's hard for people in the age of google and wikipedia. We expect answers now. And it seems, sometimes, that the temporal perspective offers quick, accurate answers. That can be incredibly compelling. Yet we know that someday, eventually, we will gain the eternal perspective which will bring all into perfect clarity.   Sometimes, when the encircling gloom of worldly cares seems to blot out the kindly light of spiritual understanding, I make a special effort to use my spiritual eye more. I don't try to shut down the temporal, as that's just a different form of cynicism, but merely open the spiritual more. I study scripture topics like ""godly knowledge"" and seek answers and reassurances. Often these reassurances come in the form of ""someday..."" but that keeps me going."
lds,16a33l,POOR_IMPULSE_CONTR0L,2,Thu Jan 10 00:52:02 2013 UTC,"I like this explanation. I used to be at level 1 a lot when I was young. I would let confirmation bias get in the way of truly considering that I might be wrong. To me it was a given that as a member of the church I could not accept the theory of evolution, or from-birth homosexuality etc. and I never really stopped to question that stance. It was simply a part of my religion that I grew up with.   Later I started shifting into level 2. I started reading anti-literature and got more heavily into the science stuff. I was inactive for a large part of my youth. Then one day It occurred to me that I had made a fatal mistake in how I viewed the anti-literature that had shaken my faith so. I had not considered the thought that they might simply be lying, framing things improperly and ignoring facts that did not fit the Anti agenda. As soon as I realized this I saw that material in a new light. I started more carefully researching the stuff in there and came to the conclusion that the church was true after all.   This threw me right back down to level 1 long enough to send me on my mission. I had some awesome spiritual experiences that forever anchored my testimony of the truth in me. However contact with the mission field and some decidedly level 1 mission companions pushed me right past level 2 into level 3.   For the first time I considered that maybe there wasn't a conflict after all. Maybe the conflict came form both sides missunderstanding each other. I researched more about the church stances and realized that a lot of things I assumed were solid church doctrine actually weren't. Even the apostles and the prophet didn't agree on things like evolution etc. This made me more careful in making sweeping statements about such things and caused me to focus my teaching on the savior and the restoration.   Today I feel like I have a tentative grasp of lvl 3. I try to keep an open mind to both spiritual and temporal knowledge and try to dig down and really see the why and the how of the various teachings. Sometimes I feel like I loose grasp of the spiritual side and become too academical in my approach. Other times I feel like I'm ignoring my academical integrity to not have to confront some belief I hold.   On the whole my faith has survived this contact with the academical, and in many ways become stronger because of it."
lds,16a33l,POOR_IMPULSE_CONTR0L,-2,Thu Jan 10 15:43:55 2013 UTC,"""Evolution is a complete lie"" is a fantasy, as you said.   But the statement, ""Evolution is a proven fact."" is equally a fantasy. In reality it is an extremely plausible theory that has a lot of evidence that makes it seem very probable, but it has not been empirically proven from a scientific perspective. You see, in order to prove that it is true we would have to document real cases of evolution. As of now, we have documented what we term evolution in certain types of bacteria, but in reality, we don't know enough about  what is going on in the genes of those bacteria to be able to emphatically state that they have evolved into higher order organisms. In other words, we have proven that a bacteria can become a more badass bacteria, but we haven't proven that a bacteria species can eventually become something that is no longer a bacteria.  I'm not anti-evolution, I am just pro stating things the way that they really are, especially when we are accusing others of being self deluding. We wouldn't want to be hypocrites, now would we?"
lds,16a33l,Obj_solid,0,Thu Jan 10 08:06:28 2013 UTC,"This list seems wrong. Firstly, if you are a realist then you would be an optimist, because things on average tend to get better in the future. Example: Average world life expectancy (including Africa) is now 70 years old. 200 years ago, it was like 45.  Pessimists are people who see the world only at face value and cannot see past the current moment that they are in or past their own situation. So pessimists would be level one. But there is a level below that, which I call being naive. When you are naive you are an optimist who does not understand the principle of causality. You don't understand that your actions have consequences, so you look to a bright future, but you act in ways that bring destruction. Usually, when the naive person finally hits bottom, they become a pessimist.  ""Realists"" would be level two, because they are people who see the optimistic possibilities of life, but still believe that the crappy outcomes are more likely.  Optimists are the true realists, because they realize that it is a fact that everything gets better over time, and that, in your personal life, if you apply hard work to your situation, you most likely will end up better off than you started out.  Revised list: 0 - naive (optimism without understanding of causality) 1 - pessimism 2 - realism 3 - real optimism, which is equivalent to what you called an ""improver"""

lds,169nv5,LDSatheist,10,Wed Jan 9 20:25:48 2013 UTC,"I love this question, thank you for asking, I expect an excellent discussion to follow. For myself, I don't view faith as subordinating your intellect, I see faith as a guide to our intellect requiring action to test the merits of our beliefs.   Faith is not perfect knowledge (Alma 32) but it must be based on something, it is constructed on the evidence of our experiments, experiences, and impressions obtained by following a gospel (or any) principle. Though often not a provable assertion, rational faith is still based on evidence, the evidence of how following a gospel changes or influence our lives.   Professionally, I work as a research scientist, my investigations are daily guided by what I think is probably going to happen and I exercise some measure of trust in that understanding when designing experiments. Then, based on the outcomes, I modify my thoughts to match my experience. I believe we can exercise faith in a similar way, I believe that living the gospel, or at least what I think is the gospel, will benefit my soul. I test this daily, when it works, in some measure, my faith is strengthened, when it doesn't, I alter my understanding of the gospel and try again, continually searching for the right path but guided by faith based on past experience. The difference between this and my research investigations is that the confirmations I receive are not directly transferable because they are often based on personal, internal experiences rather than an exact procedure that can be shown, and replicated. I can bear testimony, but another's faith must be based on their own tests.   Don't be afraid to be honest with your beliefs, if you do not know or cannot believe right now, that is OK, it doesn't mean you cannot know or cannot believe. I encourage you to test the principles of the gospel, one by one, and see if you find them beneficial, I imagine there are many you already have. Then, consider their source. For me, little by little, I built up faith in God, Christ, and my view of the restoration by consistent testing.   I understand where you are coming from in questioning the truth of the church (whatever we are taking that to mean) when confronted with facts, history, etc. that contradicts what we are often taught. If you would like to discuss anything in particular that might not be possible in the LDS subreddit feel free to PM me. Not for any type of anti vs apologetic debate (to be honest I have a hard time with apologist methods) but I'd be happy to share my (often unorthodox) opinions.   Finally, Elder Scott gave an excellent talk on this subject here. A few of my favorite quotes:    Some feel that any discussion of religion and the guidance one can receive through robust faith have no rational basis. However, faith is not illusion nor magic but a power rooted in eternal principles. Are you one who has tried to exercise faith and has felt no benefit? If so, you likely have not understood and followed the principles upon which faith is founded.    &   Every time you try your faith, that is, act in worthiness on an impression, you will receive the confirming evidence of the Spirit. Those feelings will fortify your faith. ... As you walk to the boundary of your understanding into the twilight of uncertainty, exercising faith, you will be led to find solutions you would not obtain otherwise.   Best of luck!"
lds,169nv5,onewatt,6,Wed Jan 9 21:31:33 2013 UTC,"Thanks for your answer.  I'm not sure if it is THE answer but it does help me look at faith in a different light.  On my mission we were taught ""blind obedience.""  I felt insulted by this concept and I admittedly see faith in the same light as blind obedience (something that is blind, not thought out or questioned).    I feel that the concept of faith portrayed in your response is derived from the effects of the church on your life and not necessarily the truthfulness of the church.  I humbly submit that this same test could be applied to any self help program (Tony Robbins?) but the truthfulness of the church does not rely so much on the fact that it may be beneficial to adherents but on the validity of the mythology behind it.    This is my problem.  My doubts about the Gospel and the church stem from my feelings about God in general, his existence, etc.  I have never felt like my prayers were heard by anyone not in the same room as me (in a physical sense).  I have never had any sort of undoubtedly spiritual experience.  The lack of spiritual confirmation in my life set into motion the path that I am on.  It is funny to think that I lost my faith in God long before I lost my faith in the BOM or Joseph Smith.  My loss of my faith in God was a undoubtedly philosophical de-conversion.  It preceded my Mormon de-conversion which was centered on logic and evidence.    It is interesting that you would quote Elder Scott.  I have always felt a connection to him.  He is the only apostle that I have met more than once.  He is the only apostle that I feel actual love for.  For the last several weeks I have felt that I should write to him...and I would but I know that the letter would be re-routed to my stake president without Elder Scott ever seeing it."
lds,169nv5,MrWienerDawg,4,Wed Jan 9 21:52:22 2013 UTC,"I'm with you on ""blind obedience"" the concept is an insult to our agency, I believe we are better than that and God (assuming existence) desires us to follow our beliefs honestly and live according to the dictates of our conscience as long as we remain humble and willing to learn. I'm sorry that was taught on your mission, they were wrong.   I like your comparison to self-help, there's definitely something there and I have had that thought myself. For me, I encompass anything which adds to my life or uplifts my soul as part of my view of the gospel. Brigham Young (in his less speculative moments perhaps) had some excellent quotes on the topic, among them this:    I want to say to my friends that we believe in all good. If you can find a truth in heaven, earth or hell, it belongs to our doctrine. We believe it; it is ours; we claim it (DBY, 2).   If I find the fruit sweet, I'll take it, even from Tony Robbins.   In my estimation, much of our gospel mythology is speculative, incomplete, or not well understood. We see through the glass darkly as it were. I can't say I know exactly how the restoration unfolded, I know the official version, I know the various and sometimes conflicting accounts behind it, I know the dubious nature of many of the claims, but still, that which I can experience directly, reading the Book of Mormon, attending the temple, pondering eternal life and progression with my loved ones, trying to show love and charity for those I come in contact with, these things are sweet to me and evidence that this gospel is a good thing. I may not grasp the atonement's width, breadth, necessity, or method, but I feel the sweet peace and love it offers. Imo, the truthfulness of the church (again whatever we are taking that to mean, certainly aspects of the church are not what one would call ""true"") depends on its efficacy in assisting adherents in obtaining  the happiness of eternal life, certainly beneficial to them.   I understand the doubt for God's existence and have often felt I was talking to an empty room. I've never had a spiritual experience like I've heard others describe - dreams, visions, miracles, voices, premonitions, and the like. I'm not sure I would even trust them if I had. I come from a fairly deep background in philosophy and have wrestled with many of the same questions I'm sure you've gone through. However, I am satisfied that there is a purpose in creation and that I have a role to play that extends beyond this limited life. I cannot say that I know incontrovertibly that there is a God, but I can say that rationally and spiritually, I believe there to be a God and I have felt subtle influences of such in my life. However, I certainly can't blame anyone for disagreeing on such a personal topic. To some extent perhaps, we do not choose our beliefs, just how rigidly we hold them. If you have not felt that confirmation, however subtle, I encourage you at least to remain open to it if it ever comes."
lds,169nv5,jgardner,3,Wed Jan 9 22:50:20 2013 UTC,"I have never had any sort of undoubtedly spiritual experience.   I think it's important to point out that if you consider your experience as a spectrum rather than absolutes it helps out with this. See it's easy to have positive spiritual experiences and immediately follow them with ""but it was probably just confirmation bias,"" or ""I'm really letting myself get overexcited about this..."" etc. and thus dismiss it. In my opinion a more fair way to approach the positives in your life is with a spectrum approach. Admit you have doubts. That you're not completely on the ""Yes it's God!"" side of the spectrum. But also be willing to recognize positives as being not completely on the ""Pure brain chemistry!"" side of the spectrum.   For example, try and do some of the things that they always say to do. For me, the beginning of my adult testimony was to attend church under my own steam - because I chose to do it rather than because I had to. After my meetings were over I walked home. I paid attention to my feelings. I noticed that I felt good. Not awash with tingles or a holy fire or anything, just noticeably better than I had felt for the past few days. My steps were lighter and I was happy. Here's the key: At that moment I made the decision to accept that feeling as at least partially a spiritual event in addition to the ""hey I did the right thing"" feelgoods. That's it. I made room for the possibility. And then, recognizing a good thing, I determined to go again next week. I also thought ""Hey, if this attending church thing works, why not try the scriptures thing?"" So I made a goal of reading at least one verse per day.   The pattern continued. I noticed positive effects from my behaviors. I admitted they could be from God - that they could be spiritual witnesses. I proceeded as if they were. More came. It wasn't long before the things I experienced became powerful and undeniable.   You don't need to look for undoubtedly spiritual experiences. Just look for possible ones. Make enough room in your heart and mind for the possibility, and then build on it a bit."

lds,169nv5,jgardner,8,Thu Jan 10 19:31:20 2013 UTC,"You're mistaking delusion for faith.  Faith is belief in things that you feel (or even know on some level) to be true, but cannot be proven to others.  Delusion is convincing yourself that you know the unknown or that something false is in fact true.        Faith isn't trying to convince yourself that Christ is your Savior.  It's hoping that He is enough to live how he taught us to.       In this way, faith inspires everything we do.  With faith, we act and speak.  It gives us the courage to do difficult things.  It drives us to do things for which there is no obvious reward.  When I drive to the hospital and bless an injured brother or sister, I do it because of my faith.  When I choose to pay tithing, it is because of my faith.  When I devote hours to church meetings and helping to run the organization, again it is my faith that presses me to service.      Faith isn't gained by reading apologetics or by rational thought.  It is gained through prayer and practice, through work and experience."

I have never been able to do this because I have never known.  Hoped?  Yes, I have hoped and if that is faith then I do have an inkling of it.  I remember in the MTC telling one of the other Elders in my district that I don't think it's appropriate to say ""i know..."" when bearing a testimony as ""i believe..."" would be more correct.  He contradicted me and insisted that through faith we can know.  I have yet to be convinced.    Christ taught us a great many things that are virtues.  However, I do not know if he actually taught us those things or if a philosopher of some sort wrote them as a work of fiction with a virtuous message."
lds,169nv5,DesolationRobot,0,Wed Jan 9 22:20:07 2013 UTC,"I hope people do not use the word ""know"" lightly. I am sad that you have not yet achieved knowledge. I do know that not all are given this spiritual gift.  As for me, I do know. It is not a belief anymore. I do not wake up in the morning wondering whether God is real or not.  Now, the things I actually do know are shockingly few, but they are sufficient and congruent with the gospel of Jesus Christ, enough that I am confident my sins are forgiven and I can act in faith knowing that we will see the result we anticipate at some future stage."

lds,169nv5,slimjimbean,2,Thu Jan 10 02:50:40 2013 UTC,"how do we know if what we are feeling is faith and not delusion?   I'm not convinced that you can know the difference. You can have faith that your faith is faith and not delusion, and you can have feelings and experiences to back it up, but no matter how confident you are you could still be wrong.  At some point, you need to decide what you believe and why, and then do your best to work within that framework to do what you believe is best."
lds,169nv5,Temujin_123,-1,Wed Jan 9 22:28:13 2013 UTC,"The bottom line, and the sad, ultimate truth, is we are all delusional.  The gospel is here to help us eliminate our delusions, one by one, and replace it with faith in the real, living and eternal God.  The only way we can do that is to act on the things we believe. If it is delusion, then we will discover it to be false. If it is true, it will be confirmed."

lds,169nv5,keledor,1 point,Thu Jan 10 00:39:29 2013 UTC,"If we discover it to be false, though, it is far too late by that time. The only time most (essentially all) people will know if it is true or false is at death. At that point, if it's false, you've wasted your whole life trying to achieve the wrong goals. If it's false, your consciousness has ceased to exist entirely, or you were following the wrong path your entire life.   This is completely untrue.  The scriptures state that faith is something that must be practiced until your faith is refined and pure.  It doesn't start out as a perfect faith, but that's why you PRACTICE it until you do.  You don't have to wait til' death to find out, you just have to NOT give up practicing.  How can a man know if he ever has the potential to master playing the piano if he gives up half way and says ""It's impossible""?   How do you know you are making progress with faith?  The spirit.  2 Corinthians 2:14  14 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.   Like Marcus Aurelius said, ""Live a good life. If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by. If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them. If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones.""   That entire quote is based on a man thinking he himself is more knowledgeable and just than God.  With this type of thinking, yes, there is no way you can know the dealings of the spirit, because you have not tried to know them.  There is a God, and He is just, and He cares that you make it back to Him.  But you have to choose to make it back to Him, and it takes work.  No unclean thing can dwell with Him, we know this.  So then how can He welcome unclean things into His Kingdom?    And again, you don't have to wait til death to know what the heck is going on.  The spirit is a revelator.  You practice faith and are guided by the spirit until your faith is perfect.   Like onewatt posted, you open up in your heart and mind to just the possibility that it could be from the spirit at first, and then as you keep going through experiences and opening up more possibilities, eventually you will come to know it undeniably.   But again, this takes PRACTICE!"

lds,169nv5,keledor,4,Thu Jan 10 14:48:00 2013 UTC,"I like something Terryl Givens said about this in a forum address at BYU:   Why, then, is there more merit—given this perfect balance—in believing in the Christ (and His gospel and prophets) than believing in a false deity or in nothing at all? Perhaps because there is nothing in the universe—or in any possible universe—more perfectly good, absolutely beautiful, and worthy of adoration and emulation than this Christ. A gesture of belief in that direction, a will manifesting itself as a desire to acknowledge His virtues as the paramount qualities of a divided universe, is a response to the best in us, the best and noblest of which the human soul is capable. For we do indeed create gods after our own image—or potential image. And that is an activity endowed with incalculable moral significance.   Only the last part of that talk deals with faith vs. doubt, but you might also be interested in his letter to a doubter and his published testimony, which begins with this line:   If I have a spiritual gift it is perhaps an immense capacity for doubt."

lds,169nv5,keledor,3,Wed Jan 9 21:42:10 2013 UTC,"Faith in and of itself isn't necessarily a virtue;  in fact, faith has been behind some of the worst events in human history.     I would go so far as to say faith devoid of rationality is a vice, and the process by which we sometimes teach to promote faith could be used to reinforce faith in just about anything.     Faith needs to be guided by rational thinking.  New evidence which threatens faith should be considered rather than rejected outright.  We are humans, we are often in error, sometimes what we think we KNOW is wrong, and we need new information and experiences to mature.    Belief in the true church should not only withstand rational thought, but flourish.  For me, rationality is an  integral part of my spiritual growth."
lds,169nv5,pinkstapler,8,Wed Jan 9 22:50:40 2013 UTC,"My problem is that the LDS church does not stand up to rational thought (unless i'm irrational).  I have to solely rely on faith if I am to ""believe"" that the church is true.    This is something that is hard to do as ""having faith"" feels the same as ""lying to myself.""  I cannot tell the difference."
lds,169nv5,amertune,4,Wed Jan 9 20:54:00 2013 UTC,"Hmm.  I won't pretend to have earth-shattering insights on this matter.  But I don't really see rationality and faith as being opposite ends of the same spectrum.  I can see faith being an antidote to hubris .  i.e. ""faith"" is my willingness to accept that I don't understand everything and that my rational mind is inherently limited.  Rationality and faith can both progress simultaneously.  But hubris and faith cannot.  Now that's easier said than done, I believe. And it is a hefty human struggle for a lot of us, so I wish I had any meaningful advice.  But if you're asking for worldviews and opinions, there's mine."
lds,169nv5,kadjar,1 point,Wed Jan 9 21:00:25 2013 UTC,Sorry I'm not trying to imply that faith and rational thought cannot coexist.   What I mean is that the evidence must be negated by faith if belief in the church is to continue.   I agree that rationality and faith can progress simultaneously but that goes back to my original question.  Why let faith progress at all?  Why is it considered a virtue?  Thank you for your response.
lds,169nv5,josephsmidt,1 point,Wed Jan 9 21:35:20 2013 UTC,"I agree that rationality and faith can progress simultaneously but that goes back to my original question. Why let faith progress at all?   I think the evidence is clear in your own post. If there is a God, or just a spiritual perspective worth having, the only way to know him begins with an act of faith.  To come to know God requires the ability to suspend temporal judgement, to have patience, and to act because of evidences rather than because of proofs. You don't say ""Hey, this mountain doesn't really exist,"" you say ""Let's see how this mountain looks from a spiritual perspective in addition to the temporal.""   In its way, faith is not so different from the scientific method, where we develop a hypothesis (the choice to believe), test the hypothesis (faith / acting as if it were true), and develop a theory (come to know the truth, not just believe it.). Faith is a part of the key to spiritual understanding. Science is a part of the key to temporal understanding. Both are needed to have a complete understanding of truth.   Sorry if this came out disjointed and confusing. I'm writing between calls at work."
lds,169nv5,jmf444,5,Wed Jan 9 22:06:03 2013 UTC,"I had a conversation over the holidays with my dad about this, as it is one of my major concerns (why would the most important thing for God to test us on be our willingness to follow/believe ambiguous feelings rather than on making rational decisions or just purely on our kindness and generosity?).  My dad's answer to this was that testing faith is the best way to test how we will use our free will.  Any kind of answer or pathway that is logically clear and laid out will automatically no longer qualify as a test of free will.  So faith would be a virtue in that it shows your love for God even though you have no reason to do so."
lds,169nv5,jmf444,3,Wed Jan 9 23:35:54 2013 UTC,"I love science and the balance between science and religion is a life-long pursuit of mine. Often the two become archetypes in this conflict between faith and proof. Here are some insights I've had in reconciling the two:   One of the best definitions of ""faith"" that I've come across is from Pres. Kimball: ""The exercising of faith is a willingness to accept without total regular proof and to move forward and perform works."" From that perspective, faith is less about certainty and more about a willingness to move forward in the presence of doubt and uncertainty. If it were perfect knowledge, then it wouldn't be faith. By this definition everybody exercises faith. Going to bed at night, waking up, going to work, getting in the car, getting on a plane, loving someone, letting someone love you, raising children, etc. None of it is certain and we go through life w/o total control over the circumstances around us. In fact, we often daily put our lives in the hands of others (other motorists, airplane pilots, police officers). So then, faith is the ability to see that there are no guarantees, still find it in you to hope and trust in others, and then to act on it. Faith in God is merely that same type of trust and hope but applied towards the concept that this life is not all there is to existence. It's important to recognize that the word ""know"" or ""knowledge"" is used differently by different groups. Scientifically it means that one has enough ""data"" or measurements revealing a consistent pattern than it is unreasonable to deny it. That knowledge is still an educated guess that that is a fundamental pattern of the universe, but it is deeply rooted in data. Religiously, ""knowing"" something is rooted in personal experience or from the experiences of others. One observes a consistent pattern of happiness or spirituality (the spiritual ""data"") and derives ""knowledge"" from it. The friction between the two comes when people forget the 11th article of faith and allow themselves to think that because they ""know"" some gospel truth, that others are unreasonable for not believing it. We have to be careful not to set up false dichotomies between science and religion. Religious people who think that what they ""know"" spiritually constitutes all that there is are delusional just as scientists who think that what science currently ""knows"" is infallible. Humility from either perspective is absolutely needed in order to grow in either kind of ""knowledge"". Either side must recognize that it is not perfect or complete (that includes the portion of God's truth we call the gospel in the church). We are, everyone, operating with incomplete knowledge but the human spirit and religious experience shows time and again that we have the potential to rise above that limitation. Knowledge that doesn't lead to positively affecting the lives of those around you is wasted. Science makes wonderful discoveries. History has shown that these discoveries can be used for tremendous good or evil. Likewise, spirituality throughout history has been used for great good and evil. Whatever our persuasion (either or or a mix of both), we MUST use what knowledge we gain for good.   I could go on and on (literally, I have a journal of notes from books I've read on this and insights I've gained), but one of my favorites is from a poem discovered by Cliff Stoll that was etched on a bell in a tower at the University of Buffalo:   All truth is one.  In this light, may science and religion endeavor together   for the steady evolution of Mankind:  From darkness to light,  From narrowness to broadmindedness,  From prejudice to tolerance,  It is the voice of life that calls us  To come and learn.   So, to answer your question, faith is a virtue because it is THE driving force behind human progress whether you happen to be applying spiritually or scientifically."

lds,169nv5,rtowne,5,Thu Jan 10 08:33:26 2013 UTC,I have this same question. Sometimes I wonder if faith has become a virtue because there's no real evidence behind our beliefs. Like it's sort of become this necessary defense mechanism against questions.

If God really is real, and really put us on Earth to learn and grow to be good and happy, we'd need to learn stuff like courage and patience and forgiveness... and faith.  You don't do a 10 year double-blind study before asking a girl out on a date, or hold a month-long trial examining the evidence before you choose your college major. 99% of our decisions are based on faith in something. Faith is something everyone, religious or not, needs to exercise in order to be happy and live their life."

I get courage, patience and forgiveness. But why faith? There is literally no reason to pick one religion over and other except the usual - it's what you were raised in or it makes you feel good. There is no way to know if you've chosen the right one.  The kind of faith you need when dating a girl is different. At least I can see the girl. And I don't need her to be the ""one true girl,"" just one I get along with. The church is different - it's supposed to be the ""one true church"" not just a nice place to spend three hours on Sunday."

lds,168y06,auron1223,11,Wed Jan 9 20:14:55 2013 UTC,"I'm really happy prayer helped.    I am reminded by Nephi who, in 2 Nephi 32, perceives the confusion and unbelief people have and stresses if they would just pray things would get much better:   Wherefore, now after I have spoken these words, if ye cannot understand them it will be because ye ask not, neither do ye knock; wherefore, ye are not brought into the light, but must perish in the dark...  the Spirit stoppeth mine utterance, and I am left to mourn because of the unbelief... and the ignorance... for they will not search knowledge... and it grieveth me that I must speak concerning this thing. For if ye would hearken unto the Spirit which teacheth a man to pray, ye would know that ye must pray   Nephi apparently thinks prayer is often the missing link in people's understanding.  But it makes sense, the reason he believe when his brothers did not was because he was willing to give prayer a chance: (1 Ne. 2:16)   And it came to pass that I, Nephi... did cry unto the Lord; and behold he did visit me, and did soften my heart that I did believe all the words which had been spoken by my father   contrasted with his brothers in 1 Ne. 15:7-9:   And they said: Behold, we cannot understand the words which our father hath spoken...  And I said unto them: Have ye inquired of the Lord?  And they said unto me: We have not; for the Lord maketh no such thing known unto us.   Prayer seems to make all the difference."

lds,168y06,jgardner,3,Thu Jan 10 00:46:09 2013 UTC,Exactly! The material was so extreme and attacking while offering no rational thought. It made me start to look at neutral articles that offered a non biased view of the church. That led me to really doing positive research.
lds,168y06,Wade_E,2,Thu Jan 10 01:11:10 2013 UTC,"Is there a specific moment you can trace to believing in God, a certain realization or anything like that? Or was it just gradual?"
lds,168y06,Wade_E,13,Thu Jan 10 06:34:13 2013 UTC,"Both. It had been coming on gradually an then I visited the grounds of the Mesa, Arizona Temple and it just hit me like a train that this is real."
lds,168y06,EitanWolf,3,Thu Jan 10 07:02:05 2013 UTC,"I am from Mesa as well, and I just submitted my papers for a mission. Your story motivates me immensely. Thank you for sharing!"

Not trying to be gloomy, sorry! I just know that right now it seems like there's no way you would ever forget what you've experienced, and how real it is, but lots of people do. Write it down!

lds,168y06,gnark,10,Wed Jan 9 18:58:41 2013 UTC,"The only ""difficulty"" about the transition was to stop drinking tea but mainly because it was a habit. I would be checking out at the store and realize I accidentally but tea in my cart. And yes my wife and I are primary teachers!"

lds,168y06,stillDREw,10,Thu Jan 10 16:44:30 2013 UTC,How come? They have been nothing but supportive and are happy for me. While they are atheist they still respect and support my choices.
lds,168y06,joey5755,4,Thu Jan 10 16:45:50 2013 UTC,"I don't doubt that they are; my wife and I would do likewise with our kids, but I can't say we wouldn't be privately unhappy about it.  I obviously don't know your parents, and don't mean to imply that they're necessarily unhappy with your choices.  I just think it's interesting to reflect on this mirror image of the cliche ""religious parents disappointed by son/daughter who left the church"" situation that gets discussed so much on the internet."
lds,168y06,WooperSlim,7,Wed Jan 9 15:16:55 2013 UTC,I see what you're saying. Well as far as I know they are happy for me. And i hope they aren't secretly disappointed or saddened.
lds,168y06,joey5755,1 point,Wed Jan 9 15:25:09 2013 UTC,"My experience says that they probably won't be. Just keep being the good son you are, and add on top of that. Be sure to spend as much time as you can with them, especially now that they are likely empty nesters."
lds,168y06,WooperSlim,3,Wed Jan 9 15:32:21 2013 UTC,What advice would you give to exmormons who now identify themselves atheists?
lds,168y06,onewatt,4,Wed Jan 9 15:44:31 2013 UTC,"Read scripture, visit the temple grounds often, and pray."
lds,168y06,joey5755,-2,Thu Jan 10 01:12:02 2013 UTC,I have given the same advice to them many times. Unfortunately they don't seem interested.  They've flunked the test of faith.
lds,168y06,onewatt,10,Wed Jan 9 18:55:12 2013 UTC,Some exmormons are exmormon because they've done those thing countless times and not gotten anything out of it. That may be why they aren't interested in that response.
lds,168y06,joey5755,3,Wed Jan 9 19:30:38 2013 UTC,"I find that in faith as in most areas of life, what you get out of it depends on your attitude going in."
lds,168y06,onewatt,11,Wed Jan 9 19:41:31 2013 UTC,"It's a (sadly) typical assumption by members of the church that those who leave for doctrinal/historical reasons never really tried to stay, never had a testimony, or somehow didn't correctly follow the absurdly simple steps that are supposed to work for everyone."
lds,168y06,CaptainMoroni,6,Wed Jan 9 20:37:25 2013 UTC,"I agree. Please don't assume ex-mormons are the way they are because they are broken or lazy or stupid. That's judging, and it is not how the Lord looks at them.  I can testify that the Lord simply doesn't call everyone at the same time.  If you're in the church and you don't have a confidence you should be, I encourage you to seriously question whether you should be, and try your best to include God in the equation. It is my sincere hope that the Lord will give you the confirmation you're looking for, but it is my understanding that he answers prayers in his own time and in his own way. It is pointless to try to rush him."
lds,168y06,jgardner,2,Wed Jan 9 20:38:44 2013 UTC,"This is a very humane way for a ""faithful"" Mormon to approach things.  I remember I started sitting more and more classes out, to start with, as I realized that it was hurting me to attend. I really started to prefer reading the Ensign and pacing in hallways."
lds,168y06,jgardner,2,Wed Jan 9 21:06:28 2013 UTC,"I don't know.. That's probably true in most cases but I think it's on the line when it comes to religion. I know exmormons that were raised in the church, and who had a great attitude about it. Then in the teenage years they started to question a bit or just faded away.  I guess the question is: What comes first? Lack of faith or faith is lacking? If that makes sense."
lds,168kzd,MaelSjigli,8,Wed Jan 9 07:30:16 2013 UTC,"YOU ARE NOT ALONE! Let me stress that to you. Do not lose faith. There is definitely a place for you.  I have had the exact same feelings that you're feeling. The huge disparity of trying to reconcile the two pulls that seem to divide your life is something that only gay LDS people can understand.  I only came out to my family in November 2012. Things get MUCH better. I had the same exact fears of the reactions of family, friends, peers and others. You have to live your life for yourself.  I am living faithful to the Gospel and I know that the Church is true. I also have a boyfriend (RM also) and I talk to my bishop every other week to make sure things are staying on the right path – which they are. Being able to feel loved by someone while keeping faithful to what you know is true has been an amazing thing for me.  There is hope out there for you. There are many people in the same boat as you. I felt similarly as hopeless, but things do get better.  There are a growing number of resources out there. Don't be afraid of finding LGBT resources. There are specific ones that are targeted toward the LDS community. Here a couple things to look at:  •http://farbetweenmovie.com  •http://www.affirmation.org  •Understanding Same-Gender Attraction (USGA) in Provo has been amazing too.  I hope this helps. I have felt so divided throughout my life, and I just barely turned 26, but things get SO much better. Don't lose hope, and don't lose your faith."
lds,168kzd,mtwede,7,Wed Jan 9 08:05:08 2013 UTC,"So many questions. If I am being intrusive then say so.   Do you guys hold hands at church?  Do you get funny looks and snide comments from people still?  Do people accuse you of trying to undermine the sanctity of the family unit? If so what do you say to them?  At what point was your bishop like ""yeah sure have a boyfriend, it is fine as long as you keep the law of chastity just like everyone else should?""  Okay, that was only four. I just had the unfortunate experience yesterday where my institute teacher (in the UK it is a calling, not a job) mentioned her interactions with gay men at work. She read a quote about how vice should be shunned, but too often we allow it to go on, and then come to embrace it. This was interpreted as meaning she shouldn't be friends with gay people. Normally I love, love, love this woman. But last night upset me a little.  But I didn't feel like I could say anything that wouldn't come across as contentious, so I am gathering information about latter day saints who are successfully living the gospel while also being gay."
lds,168kzd,Thuseld,6,Wed Jan 9 09:18:11 2013 UTC,"A couple things:  I am not publicly out to the whole world. Just to my immediate family and my friends.   There are about a dozen peers in my singles ward who know, and every single one of them has treated me exactly the same as before. No difference at all. This has been surprising because I always expected a giant rejection.   We don't hold hands at church, but we do in public outside of church. I have seen a couple ward members who have seen me holding hands or staying warm by hugging closely at the frontrunner train station in Salt Lake. We have gotten strange looks from those members – only because it is obviously shocking and I hadn't been able to explain myself to them beforehand.   Of the two months that we have been together, the only remarks that random people have made have been positive ones. This is also surprising to me. I think society is becoming more open minded.   Whenever people mention the sanctity of marriage, it's always a topic that drives me a little crazy. Nobody has approached me directly for a discussion on it, but it has been brought up at firesides that we've attended together. Here are my thoughts on it:  A man and a woman can get married and divorced an innumerable amount of times and nobody ever mentions that they are ruining the sanctity of it. I know people who have been married 8 times.  A 90 year old man and a 18 year old girl can get married without the question of sanctity.   Many straight couples are able to marry without love being the issue at hand (for convenience, money, business, etc.)  Personally I think that is not treating marriage how Heavenly Father intended. I would LOVE to marry a person who I love. It's still a battle though. I don't want a comment debate, so please don't debate me here about this, but I completely support gay marriage and think it's silly that I can't marry who I love, but all those previous points don't cause any concern for the Christian and LDS communities.   And your last question: My bishop was the first person in the world to whom I came out. I know it probably should have been family, but I was feeling so overwhelmed with the idea of telling them and I needed help and advice from someone who I trusted that I knew wouldn't hate me. I told him two years ago. It hasn't been a continual battle or anything, but two months ago I told him that I needed to start dating. He told me what he tells everyone else – to keep it within the law of chastity and there wouldn't be a problem. My bishop has been very supportive of me and my boyfriend."
lds,168kzd,mtwede,2,Wed Jan 9 18:46:49 2013 UTC,"That is a very interesting, heartwarming story. I'm sorry you and your boyfriend aren't allowed to be closer right now, but I'm glad that your bishop and friends have been so understanding. I hope things get better for you."
lds,168kzd,sunnydalebetty,2,Sat Jan 12 00:50:09 2013 UTC,"Internet hugs  As an exmo with a gay brother (also exmo) I don't need to tell you anything you don't already know.  I wish you all the best, and I honestly believe that the church will hold gay marriages in the temple someday.  Although that likely won't be for another 30 years or so."
lds,168kzd,washington_compass,3,Wed Jan 9 19:56:29 2013 UTC,"Hey there MaelSjigli! Thanks for your post. I have a long post for you, but please bear with me :)  We live in a time of increasing temptations. Whether it be Word of Wisdom, lying, or morality, we all are susceptible to faltering. Gay, straight, white, or black, these problems are real.Lucky for us, revelation (and especially personal revelation) is real too! How lucky we are to live in a world where we have access to communication with our Father in Heaven.   Recently, there has been much talk about homosexuality, which the church more frequently refers to as ""Same-gender attraction"". I would like to point you to both the LDS definition, and the new church website meant to reach out to those struggling with this :)  http://www.lds.org/topics/same-gender-attraction?lang=eng  http://www.mormonsandgays.org/ (this is the new LDS website)  I particularly liked the first paragraph in the first link. I would also encourage you, if you haven't already, to seek out priesthood blessings. Heavenly Father has guidance for you, and anyone with sincere questions.  There are many choices here, but I think the most obvious is this: Will I act on these feelings, or will I not? To act on them is to break the Law of Chastity-- Here is the direct quote from For the Strength of Youth: Sexual Purity ""Homosexual and lesbian behavior is a serious sin. If you find yourself struggling with same-gender attraction or you are being persuaded to participate in inappropriate behavior, seek counsel from your parents and bishop. They will help you.""  As for coming out, that is a different matter, and entirely up to you. I would suggest that you discuss this matter with your bishop. I think he will be able to address your concerns, and help you be more open with your parents, so that you can work through all this together!  Last, but not least, I would advise that you really look to LDS websites. There is a lot of information out there and some of it can take you further from the spirit. Pay close attention to whether the information you are reading from LGBT communities is really bringing you closer to Christ. At the end of our lives it will be our testimonies and faith in Christ that will aid us, and our reliance on earthly sin that will harm us. ""O Be wise, what can I say more?""  TL;DR Jesus loves you, and is always wanting you to draw closer to him :)  PS, I have read these in the past, and I love them. Take a peek!  http://www.lds.org/ensign/2007/10/helping-those-who-struggle-with-same-gender-attraction?lang=eng  http://ldsliving.com/story/68799-living-with-same-sex-attraction-our-story"
lds,168kzd,allbeefpatties,2,Wed Jan 9 08:07:19 2013 UTC,Family before bishop.  Too many times the bishop knows before mom and dad.  His dad should have his back 100%.
lds,168kzd,allbeefpatties,2,Wed Jan 9 13:54:37 2013 UTC,"Can you expound on that? One of the hardest things about all of this is that I will at some point have to tell my dad. Our relationship has been rocky the last few years and he's expressed to me multiple times that he's disappointed in me, that he wishes I could be more normal, and he thinks I'm out of touch with reality and not willing to do work or be an adult. This has been hard considering my circumstance, and I've been trying to search for a reason he thinks this way of me; I have a 4.0 GPA and I'm on track to graduate with my Associates degree when I'm eighteen.  I've been planning to come out to my bishop next, and then my siblings, then my mom (or both parents)."
lds,168kzd,allbeefpatties,3,Wed Jan 9 15:52:32 2013 UTC,"First, internet bro hug for you.  I don't envy your challenges and hope you can navigate them well.  You're not a bad person for having these challenges.  So being a dad is tough.  There's no manual.  Most dads do what they saw their dad do in regards to parenting.  It's not always the best way.  Also, your dad is not an expert in the issues you're facing.  I'm a firm believer that if you put yourself in someone's shoes and think about it long enough, you can start to see why they react the way they do.    Here's the tough fact of life when it comes to parents.  They're wrong.  A lot.  I know, because I am a parent and I make more mistakes than I care to admit.  Parents don't know everything either.  It's a realization that everyone comes to someday.  ""Holy crap, my dad isn't Superman.""  Now add in the fact that he sees you as a kid.  You won't be his peer for quite a while.  And even when you are, he will still see you as that goofy kid  that drew on the walls with crayons and covered himself in birthday cake.    But a bishop is more willing to deal with you as if you were an adult.  They have the benefit of distance.  They're not your dad or uncle or brother (unless the bishop is your dad or uncle or brother...it's happened in my ward twice for various families).  They get to be a bit more objective because they didn't wipe your butt and watch you learn and grow.    So who would you rather go talk to?  Usually the youth end up in a bishop's office first.  When the bishop asks 'Have you talked to your parents about this?' The answer, 95%+ of the time, is no.    ""They'll freak out""  ""They'll kick me out""  ""They won't understand""  I could go on, but you get the idea.  We (parents) are failing our kids (youth of the church) by not having relationships with them that are so strong that they have zero reservations telling us that they are in over their heads.  They can't come to us and tell us what's going on because we 'won't listen'.    I am trying desperately to build the kind of relationship with my girls that enables them to come tell me when something is up.  That they might feel a bit uncomfortable, but they KNOW that I won't freak out.  That I'll listen, hug them and say ""We'll get through this.""  I would guess that your dad loves you.  He is just not equipped to deal with what you are going to hand him.  In my other post in this thread, I give a fairly mature approach to talking to your parents.  I'd suggest you read that and hit me up with questions if you have them.    Again, you're not a bad person for having these challenges."
lds,168kzd,dhr_3343,2,Wed Jan 9 23:20:24 2013 UTC,"My dad basically threw me out when I came out to him as transgender. I agree that family should come first and should have your back, but it's worth acknowledging that this isn't always the case, and he should talk to whomever he feels safest discussing this with."
lds,168kzd,allbeefpatties,2,Wed Jan 9 23:33:40 2013 UTC,I'm sorry that happened to you.  You make a good point.  There are exceptions.
lds,168kzd,allbeefpatties,2,Sat Jan 12 00:51:44 2013 UTC,"I'm a straight married guy, but  my oldest daughter came out about a year ago, and since then I have become far more involved in LDS LGBT community issues.   It is important for you to connect with a mentor or similar support to help you talk through issues and navigate the coming out process, because while it's an exciting time to come out and be your legitimate self with the people you love, you might face unexpected challenges in your relationships with family and friends and your testimony.   Affirmation is developing a network of LDS people to help people just like you. Reach out to them to see whether they have any in your area, and do it soon. Let me know if you have any questions, okay?"
lds,168kzd,josephsmidt,2,Sat Jan 12 15:42:32 2013 UTC,"Some context.  I'm in my mid thirties, married with a pile of young kids.  Never had to struggle with what you're going through.  I have a family member who is dealing with the same thing you are.  As a straight LDS guy in a pretty densely populated LDS area, it took some effort to understand what my family member was up against.  I bring this up because you will have to fight this same battle on some level.  Here's some things to keep in mind:  -You're still a child of a God who loves you.  You're not a bad person for having this challenge.    -You are already 'comfortable' with this issue.  Now that doesn't mean you're emotionally happy or not conflicted. It simply means that you've been living with this for some time and it's not a surprise to you. It will be a surprise to those around you that you confide in.  And unfortunately, they're human.  Some of them will disappoint you.  Some will surprise you with how supportive they can be.  Not much you can do about it, so just expect it.  -Unless you're a superb actor and your parents aren't paying attention at all, they have a suspicion that something is up.  I don't know what kind of relationship you have with your parents, but they should be your best/first resource for unconditional love and support.  Yes, this may hit them hard.  I don't know how they'll react.  I can tell you that as a parent, I signed up to love, support and help my kids no matter what.  I don't have to love every decision they make or every challenge they face.  But I do have to stand next to them and face life just the same as they do.   You're going to have to tell them at some point.  Compose your thoughts ahead of time.  Literally schedule a time to sit them both down and talk.  Tell them ahead of time that you need x amount of minutes to talk before they react.  You need to get everything in the open.  Ask that they respect you enough to allow you to say what you need to say and then they can ask questions.  When you do tell them, make sure you let them know that you understand this may freak them out and it may upset them.  You'll want to disarm the knee-jerk reaction that they may have by letting them know that it's ok if they need some time to think about it.  You CAN disarm much of the explosive reactions of people if you can anticipate them and let them know that it's ok to feel a certain way.  But after that 'freak-out', you need them cool, calm and collected because you need their help.  Make sure you make that clear.  You want their love, help and support.  No different than if you were suffering from a terminal illness.  Remember, you're already 'comfortable' with this struggle.  They're not.  -LDS people are people.  This will be a litmus test of their Christianity.  Some will be Christ-like and respond the way you would hope.  Others will not.  I've seen it and it can be the ugliest thing you can imagine (ie. ultimatums, being 'kicked out' of a family, etc).  It can also be the biggest tender mercy when people put their arm around you and tell you they don't care and they just want to support you in any way they can.  But you have to expect the bi-polar responses in the people around you.  -Education.  I've learned a ton about what my family member is going through.  It has helped me better empathize and handle my own feelings about it.  Your friends, leaders, family, etc will all need to do the same.    Good luck.  I wish you the best."
lds,168kzd,whedonfan,2,Wed Jan 9 13:02:02 2013 UTC,"What you've written is a great thing. I've been planning on coming out to people close to me with more confidence and more of a plan, and less drively or hopeless or founder-y.  Thanks for taking the time, it's given me a great perspective on how to deal with coming out to people I care about."
lds,168kzd,Super_delicious,1 point,Wed Jan 9 15:50:08 2013 UTC,"You're welcome.  My own experience with my family member really helped me understand how we are ostracizing our own family/friends/brothers by not dealing with this properly.    If you put yourself in the shoes of the person you want to talk to, you will gain a better appreciation for how this news will affect them.  Taking that into account will help you be prepared to explain the situation and get the support you need.    You're going to need to acknowledge his feelings regarding this news.  Come to grips that he will be afraid of the backlash from his friends, ward members, other family members.  Imagine what that feels like.  As much as you want their empathy, they'll need yours.  Spend 30 minutes imagining what people will say to your dad.  Imagine what he'll feel like.  And when you finally get a grip on all that, make sure you let him know that you have thought about that.  Let him know that you know that this is going to have those repercussions on his life.  That's what people who love each other do.

It always helps to find perspective; I don't have very large a sample size. One of my Mormon friends makes a comment about how Hitler should have 'finished off the fags', and another supports gay marriage and rights and people, so it's a little confusing at times.

I prayed and asked why it had to be this way, and I didn't receive an answer.  Soon afterwards I saw things which convinced me that the Church was not true. I felt absolutely sick, because I had been raised in it and knew nothing else and wanted it to be true.  I left not because of that, but because I felt that I couldn't condone my tithing money being used for things like Prop 8. But things were extremely hard for me sometimes, because my family was Mormon and I'd been raised Mormon. If we'd lived in Utah, it would've been even harder.  I'm not saying this to convince you to do what I did, but to show that I understand it'll be hard for you one way or another. Even spending time thinking or learning about this is hard. But it seems like you're starting to realize you can't put off doing so forever.  A couple of questions that may help (or might make things worse):  1) If the Church allows gay marriage a couple of decades down the road, like it allowed blacks to have the priesthood, how will you feel if you'd remained celibate versus if you'd left and pursued a relationship?  2) Do you feel it's your fault that you are afraid of being hurt for coming out?  3) If you don't, are you comfortable with being a part of something that makes others feel that way?"

It's quite the dichotomizing pull, but what's life without a little conflict (Can you tell I'm cheerful at the moment?).  While I don't have a problem with the institution of the church and I don't think I'll feel bitter in the future, I can't expect others to be completely tolerant of a kind of person and an aspect of me they have such little experience with (again, can't you see I'm happy and sympathetic right now? Feels great, man. Too bad I don't feel like this all the time...).

lds,1682dt,xochitec,2,Wed Jan 9 02:59:06 2013 UTC,"I don't live in the Western U.S., so having the mission experience on my resume is a very unique selling point and is always brought-up in interviews.  I've been off my mission for over 10 years and I still have it on there.  I actually put it under ""Work Experience"" and in the detail I specify that it was completely unpaid.  Putting it under ""Volunteer Experience"" really does you a disservice, I think, since most people associate volunteer experience as some little fun thing you did once in your free-time (and I've seen many hiring managers completely ignore that section) - whereas the mission was not only your ""job,"" but your entire LIFE, for two full years.    I translate some of mission work into business-speak.  For example:   Teaching lessons = ""goal-focused, one-on-one coaching"" Giving talks = ""preparing and conducting presentations for hundreds of individuals"" District/Zone leader or Assistant = ""managed X individuals""   I would not put # of converts - that just seems really tacky to me for some reason.  I would put # of hours worked, # of lessons taught, # of doors knocked or # of individuals contacted per week, month, etc.  This at least shows your work ethic and self-discipline.    If, in the interview, they press you for how you measured success, I have responded this way:   This mission was spiritual in nature, and the goal was to help change people's lives for the better.  This is inherently difficult to measure using hard statistics.  I measured my success by how hard I worked and the satisfaction of helping as many people as I could overcome obstacles to become better people."

I've never lived in Utah, I imagine it's different there, but I've worked mostly in the largely evangelical Midwest and South.  I don't like putting it on my resume because religion is one of those taboo subjects in interviews that shouldn't go on a resume or really be discussed in the workplace.  Moreover, for equal opportunity employers, even the discussion of religion in interviews can be grounds for all sorts of discrimination issues.  Also, having interviewed numerous candidates myself, I can tell you that discussion of religion in an interview is not professional.  Keep in mind that people have all sorts of weird prejudices, and putting your religion as LDS on a resume in certain companies or areas could cost you a job.  For example, in the Bible belt in the US, Mormonism is despised.  Even in more neutral areas, you get all the weird misconceptions that come with that.  For example, you don't want someone asking if you have four wives like Kody Brown and you don't want them to unfairly peg you as a weirdo due to something they saw about Warren Jeffs."

Thanks for the insights. Having been an interviewer, what can a candidate do to bring out the legitimate benefits of a mission while keeping it professional (i.e., making it clear that I do not intend to bring religion into the workplace) when the topic of mission service comes up?"
lds,1682dt,LordofKleenex,1 point,Wed Jan 9 05:51:05 2013 UTC,"I like what Noppers said about putting the mission experience without church name in those early stages of your career.   what can a candidate do to bring out the legitimate benefits of a mission while keeping it professional   The first thing that an interviewer wants to know is ""Is this a person I can trust?""  It's not a sufficient condition of employment, but it is absolutely necessary, and people rely on first impressions to tell them this.  Your mission experience will implicitly go a long ways toward that.  It's all non-verbal.  It's about open posture, mirroring (naturally, not forced), how you dress, and how you talk, humor (carefully, a very light touch) all those things you learn in your mission to build relationships of trust.  Even if you're not putting it in your resume, your mission experience will show through in your interpersonal skill.  One key difference, however, is that sharing of personal information should be sharply limited in an interview situation, whereas it was used to build rapport in the field.  I don't know what kind of work you are going into.  I've been in software development for a long time and consulted for many years of that.  In the dotcom crash of 2001, I went three months without a consulting gig (although I was still employed by my consulting company), since then, I never went more than a weekend without a job.  I'm good at what I do, but I interview very well, thanks to the skills I learned as a missionary.  Leadership  This is a little off-topic.  While it's good to mention leadership, I personally don't think leadership in the mission is highly applicable to most corporate situations, because the mission is authoritarian (and all-encompassing) and corporate leadership tends to be more egalitarian.  Mixing these two mindsets can be problematic.  If you have a project leader in a corporation, they are in charge of keeping track of a project; including resources (incl. time) put towards it.  They may assign people to tasks, but their control ends there.  You may have a personnel leader who is in charge of salaries, time-off, etc., or problems that arise.  Personal privacy is expected to be guarded.   These two roles may end up in the same person, but they do not wield the totality of control over your life that mission presidents (and to a lesser degree, assistants, zone leaders, district leaders and especially, senior companions) do, and their degree of control over you is explicitly limited, and also implicitly limited by the fact that if you don't like a place, you're free to walk out at any time."

I was responsible for making sure their work was going well, they were emotionally stable, their living conditions were acceptable.   Don't try and down-play the fact that it is for a religious organisation. A friend of mine did that, and when he tried to get a job working for a fellow Mormon, he didn't even recognize it as a mission.  Also, if they ask about it in an interview, don't shy away from it either. This is personal choice, but I am pretty sure that my current job is one I have only because of my jokey comment  IN THE INTERVIEW about ""if I can sell religion, I can sell anything.""

Make sure that your mission isn't the only thing in that section.  Volunteer work is essential to getting the really nice jobs.  It proves that you are motivated, and a good citizen.  But you really don't need to say very much.  Just that it was a mission, where it was, and when.  Maybe a sentence or two about it.  Almost everyone, even non members, know what it means.

I take their words as the words of very smart, experienced men who, for the most part, know what they are talking about. If the advice is sound, I begin living it immediately. Otherwise, I need to have the Spirit back up what they are teaching. If that never comes, I am not bound to those words. Very rarely have things taught in, say, General Conference or Stake Conference not been confirmed to me. But some have been confirmed to the negative. I won't go into detail on those.  Salvation and exaltation are personal. The Lord isn't going to outsource your relationship with him and the Father with others testimonies."
lds,167g8g,amertune,7,Tue Jan 8 22:06:34 2013 UTC,"Never. I don't advocate anyone ever assume something is true. I believe in personal revelation and that we have a right to investigate doctrine, principles,and truth for ourselves without having to rely on others for our testimony. If we want to know the truth of a principle, we should study it from every angle including listening to what our leaders teach and weighing how consistently they are correct (pretty dang consistently), and then make it a matter of personal prayer seeking confirmation.   Now if one has a testimony based on personal experience and revelation that the prophet, apostles, etc. are called of God, then I think it is wise to follow their counsel in the meantime while seeking confirmation for oneself. But I would not say we should just assume it's true. Every tub has to stand on its own bottom.    What a pity it would be if we were led by one man to utter destruction! Are you afraid of this? I am more afraid that this people have so much confidence in their leaders that they will not inquire for themselves of God whether they are led by Him. I am fearful they settle down in a state of blind self-security, trusting their eternal destiny in the hands of their leaders with a reckless confidence that in itself would thwart the purposes of God in their salvation and weaken that influence they could give to their leaders, did they know for themselves, by the revelations of Jesus, that they are led in the right way. Let every man and woman know, by the whispering of the Spirit of God to themselves, whether their leaders are walking in the path the Lord dictates, or not. This has been my exhortation continually.  - Brigham Young (JOD Volume 9: Page 150)   Obviously there are standards set for participation in ordinances and we should keep those standards honestly if we desire to participate. But we should seek to know them for ourselves, not just because we are told they are right."
lds,167g8g,amertune,5,Tue Jan 8 22:48:05 2013 UTC,"When General Authorities speak, they are often repeating things that have been taught by other General Authorities. Sometimes they repeat things from figures outside the church (such as C.S. Lewis). I believe that they learn church doctrine, for the most part, the same way as everybody else--by studying and being taught. At the same time, they have the responsibility to be receptive to revelation and are responsible for guiding the church.   Given that, when does a teaching reach the sort of critical mass of support among the leaders that we should assume it is true?   Faith and discipleship is a very personal thing. You should assume that something is true when you pray about it and receive an answer that it is true.  This is, I presume, also what church leaders do. This is how I understand that President Hinckley viewed revelation. If there are any dramatic Joseph Smith-style revelations then they are not being published or talked about.  Although they have other roles, one thing that General Authorities do is act as Elders (eg old/mature members of the faith who are wise and have a good handle on doctrine). We trust their consensus and assume that they are led by God to reach that consensus. We should still rely on personal revelation to confirm their consensus.  Even from the beginning of the church, individual members of the top quorums of the church were able to speculate, have/teach incorrect opinions, apostatize, or commit sin resulting in excommunication. They are not perfect, and what they teach is not and never has been perfect.   When does a teaching cross the threshold that faith demands we suspend our understanding (assuming we personally disagree with it) and trust the leaders, given that the Church itself admits the possibility of error by those leaders?   I don't believe that you are supposed to ignore your heart and mind and place all responsibility for decisions on another, but you are asked to sustain the leaders of the church."

lds,167g8g,AnimeJ,7,Tue Jan 8 23:07:28 2013 UTC,"Sustain has a few meanings. The intended meaning, I believe, is to accept them as honest and inspired, and to follow them.  We also literally sustain church leaders by way of stipends."
lds,167g8g,pierzstyx,3,Tue Jan 8 23:20:31 2013 UTC,"I think sustaining is an action.  We sustain our bishop by serving faithfully in our callings.  We sustain him by doing our home and visiting teaching.  We sustain him by working with the missionaries to spread the gospel.  We sustain him by helping all members of the ward (active and less active) to come unto Christ.  These are the things he has been charged with stewardship over.  He can't do it all himself.  That is why he asks us to help.  When we sustain someone, we help them execute their responsibilities.  I don't necessarily think it means to blindly accept everything they say.  The1WhoFightsTheBull has a quote from Brigham Young that puts words to that thought fairly well..."
lds,167g8g,pierzstyx,1 point,Wed Jan 9 13:35:47 2013 UTC,"First off, I feel that this is somewhat of a loaded question. Nothing in the sidebar, at least in my estimation, is intended to state that the President of the Church or other Apostles are infallible, but simply that they aren't going to outright lie about something, or purposefully steer us wrong. That doesn't mean that things can't change, or that they won't change; there's plenty of history showing that to the contrary.   That said, things are the way they are for a reason. Most times, if not all times, we won't understand the why or how of things; that's what faith is all about. I do agree with other posters that we should seek a confirmation of things for ourselves, but in so far as counsel from the general authorities and other authorities go, if we don't understand it or agree with it, then take it on faith and go with it. One of my favorite talks from Conference talks about this; Pres Uchtdorf's talk on ""Seeing the End from the Beginning"". Look it up if you're not familiar with it, it's a good read."
lds,167g8g,pierzstyx,0,Wed Jan 9 01:10:45 2013 UTC,"It has been repeatedly said that if you follow the guidance of the Prophet and the majority of the Quorum of the Twelve you won't be lead astray. God speaks to these men. They are not perfect. But they are good men with the power and authority to speak in God's name. Instead of looking for times when we should be obeying their counsel the default should always be to obey their counsel. Even when we don't understand it or agree with it. The point in having Prophets and Apostles is that they are closer to God than we are and when we can't hear Him because our biases and prejudices and personal emotions get in the way, they get it directly form the source undiluted."
lds,167g8g,Pahoran,1 point,Wed Jan 9 12:27:27 2013 UTC,"I've met with a lot of people for whom the default was to obey, and questioned that not out of ""pride"" but because they saw that obeying was hurting someone.  I'm also not sure it's consistent with LDS teachings to say that the General Authorities lack ""biases and prejudices and personal emotions."""
lds,167g8g,amertune,1 point,Sat Jan 12 01:13:08 2013 UTC,"I have meet those people too. One of the most stalwart men I have ever known was a black man baptized at 17 in 1967. Guess what he had to deal with for 12 years. And make no mistake. It hurt him not being able to hold the Priesthood. Or being sealed to his wife and children. But he also knew the Church was true and that these men were teaching God's word. Sometimes obedience is hard, and because it is hard it hurts. But that is not a reason not to obey. And just because it hurts you doesn't mean you're justified in not following their counsel.   I never said they lacked biased and prejudices. In fact I'm pretty sure that at least Bruce R. McConkie and Joseph Fielding Smith were mildly racist and Franklin D. Richards was very racist. That said the Prophets and Apostles have a much more forceful relationship with God. For example, I can't help but notice that all of Joseph Fielding Smith's ideology about blacks being cursed because they were fence-sitters in Heaven disappeared rapidly once he became Prophet. Once he was in a position to teach it as doctrine God instructed him otherwise and Joseph Fielding stopped teaching it.  But all this goes to making the point of my first sentence. Follow the Prophet and the majority of the Twelve and you will never be lead astray. Not because they are imperfect or infallible, but because this is God's work and He won't allow it. On the other hand if you go off your own way and do not follow their counsel you will apostatize."
lds,167g8g,amertune,1 point,Sat Jan 12 07:16:14 2013 UTC,"Would that include the counsel given by Brigham Young to pray and receive verification from God that a given teaching is of him, and not just to obey because a prophet or any other mortal said so?"
lds,167g8g,Pahoran,1 point,Sat Jan 12 07:21:20 2013 UTC,Of course you should pray and receive a witness of the Prophet. But having that testimony also comes with the responsibility to submit to their counsel. Even when you disagree with it because that is the point of having a Prophet. He points the way when we are wrong.
lds,167g8g,Pahoran,-7,Mon Jan 21 03:08:26 2013 UTC,"In the era of correlation, nothing is published by the church without first being vetted for doctrinal accuracy."
lds,167g8g,Antonton,8,Tue Jan 8 21:53:19 2013 UTC,This doesn't answer the question.
lds,167g8g,xochitec,2,Tue Jan 8 22:01:15 2013 UTC,Perhaps Pahoran is suggesting that even though the general authorities are fallible that the correlation committee is infallible?
lds,164z1k,Chewbacca101,29,Mon Jan 7 20:21:04 2013 UTC,"When it's important for you to be the precise mouthpiece of the Lord, you will be.  Example: While on my mission, a sister was struggling with her experience. She and I had served in the same district for probably 6 months by that point, so she asked me for a blessing. We happened to be in the temple right then, doing the laundry. So when we finished we all went upstairs and found an empty office and I gave her a blessing.   Now understand, she was a native Chinese speaker. I had learned as much mandarin as a missionary can in 2 years, so I was pretty good with gospel stuff, but not much else. Well, I wasn't going to say no, so I said whatever I could think to say. Literally any comforting words or phrases I knew. (which was not a lot.) I said a lot of stuff which had my own intent behind it, but came out sounding strange to my ears, making me wonder ""did I say that right?"" I didn't feel anything other than nerves, and I left quickly, feeling uncomfortable and embarrassed at my failures at the language.  At our next district interview, where the DL (me) interviews the companionships, she asked to speak to me. She told me that the blessing I had given her was, word for word, a section of her patriarchal blessing.   Now it certainly doesn't always happen like that. In fact, I've only had it happen about twice where words came out which I didn't expect. Most of the time it's an impression similar to what I feel when I'm sitting in fast and testimony meeting. You know the one? That urge to get up and say something on a certain topic?   I used to doubt and wonder, saying ""what if that's just me?"" But then I realized it doesn't matter. In terms of blessings, sometimes all that is needed is somebody with enough faith to simply say out loud ""I rebuke this disease,"" or ""I bless you to know..."" So if I ever feel the slightest urge to do so, I take it. I'll not have blessings withheld from somebody else because I lacked the faith to simply take a step out onto a verbal ledge.   Bear in mind that learning to give blessings is a process. You need to do it a lot. Give blessings as often as you can. Take every opportunity. When not acting as voice, try to apply your faith to the prayer and think in your mind of the words that you would say for this person. (Often I find myself very much in sync with those involved in the blessing, thinking the words as they're also coming out of the mouth of the one giving the blessing. This happened a lot when I was in a bishopric.) That 'practice' can prepare and help you get more in tune with the spirit for when it's your turn.  tl;dr: Don't ever be afraid to bless!  /stream of consciousness typing on blessings."
lds,164z1k,onewatt,6,Mon Jan 7 20:44:40 2013 UTC,"I had a similar experience on my mission giving a blessing to a young hispanic lady that was visiting from a different state.  We gave a total of 8 blessings that day.  Hers was the last one and by then I was full of the spirit and recited a portion of her patriarchal blessing word for word.  Weird how that happens, but a very powerful experience for a 19 year old.  That will always remain one of the high points of my life."
lds,164z1k,C0unt_Z3r0,6,Mon Jan 7 23:35:53 2013 UTC,"Lucky for priesthood bearers all over the world, the words of the blessing aren't what invoke the blessing, so don't worry about ""blessings withheld from somebody else because I lacked the faith to simply take a step out onto a verbal ledge.""  The anointing and sealing allow the Lord to bless the recipient of the according to their faith regardless of the words."
lds,164z1k,refasu,3,Tue Jan 8 03:37:09 2013 UTC,So I just learned! That's great. I've always felt that the role of the speaker was to encourage the faith of those there so that the blessings can be unrestrained. I just never thought of it as the primary purpose.
lds,164z1k,onewatt,1 point,Tue Jan 8 04:10:04 2013 UTC,"Hmmm, good insight.    I think this does apply to healing blessings, but I think that what Onewatt said does apply to other, 'comforting' blessings so to speak.  Perhaps saying a few key words will help comfort the individual and if we choose not to say them, they won't hear them."
lds,164z1k,adlp,3,Tue Jan 8 07:23:05 2013 UTC,Thank you for the wise words Onewatt. I knew I could count on you for a good response.
lds,164z1k,ThirdPoliceman,5,Mon Jan 7 21:34:42 2013 UTC,onewatt is a baller i always enjoy his posts
lds,164z1k,smacktaix,4,Tue Jan 8 05:38:30 2013 UTC,All I wanted to add is that this has generated some fantastic comments. Thank you all for adding your ideas and testimonies.
lds,164z1k,theCroc,2,Tue Jan 8 04:16:07 2013 UTC,Indeed!
lds,164z1k,onewatt,4,Tue Jan 8 07:16:31 2013 UTC,"The first time I gave a blessing I was afraid I wouldn't know what to do, but I just went with it, did the opening, and I immediately knew what to say. It's not always like replaying a stream of words; often, ideas are placed that need conveyance, which is why there are different discernible styles between blessing-givers, but sometimes the exact wording is given too.  Go in blank and confident that the Lord will help you. If you are worthy and your intent is pure, there is nothing to worry about. Just go in and do your best.  I've found the hardest thing in giving blessings is sometimes giving it straight. We have a tendency to dampen the wording to spare feelings, or, if a thing seems unlikely to us, to shrink from saying it (or to change some language) in fear it won't happen that way. We need to make sure we have enough faith to be confident in conveying the Lord's will.  If it's a family member, I sometimes think it helps to have someone farther removed give the blessing, as they'll likely be less involved and have less trepidation."
lds,164z1k,theCroc,5,Mon Jan 7 21:34:28 2013 UTC,"Very good description. I had a very powerful experience with this last time I gave a blessing. A friend called me one morning and asked me if I could give her a blessing as she couldn't get ahold of her home teachers. I always get nervous and worry a lot before giving blessings for precisely the reasons OP gave. When she showed up we talked for a bit about what she was looking for in her blessing. (Not details, I don't really like to know too much going in as I'm afraid I will impose my own thoughts)   The interresting thing was that as soon as she sat down and I put my hands on her head all my thoughts and worries disapeared. I got through the set wording and when I got to the blessing part it was as if my head emptied completely. It was jsut this big empty void and in the middle of it a single thought. I rummaged around a bit trying to find something else but there was nothing. Only that one thought. So I said it. The thought then disapeared and another appeared. This repeated itself until suddenly there were no new thoughts. It was all empty. I took that as my cue to end the blessing and suddenly the world flooded back in.   I have felt inspired many times but I've never had it that clear before."
lds,164z1k,MrWienerDawg,2,Tue Jan 8 12:08:08 2013 UTC,That's really amazing. Thanks for sharing.
lds,164z1k,mrection,3,Tue Jan 8 14:26:20 2013 UTC,"Thanks! To add some perspective I'm a massive introvert, so my head is always full of stuff and thoughts etc. Having it just clear out like that was very different."
lds,164z1k,C0unt_Z3r0,2,Tue Jan 8 14:40:25 2013 UTC,"Thank you for the wise reply, smacktaix.  Very comforting to know I'm not doing it wrong."
lds,164z1k,amertune,2,Mon Jan 7 21:46:20 2013 UTC,"Wow, this is exactly what I've experienced.  If you only seek to be an instrument of the Lord, he will not turn you down."
lds,164z1k,Noppers,6,Mon Jan 7 21:54:42 2013 UTC,"""Healing the Sick"" by Dallin H. Oaks is a great talk on this topic -> https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2010/04/healing-the-sick?lang=eng"
lds,164z1k,mrection,9,Mon Jan 7 21:42:02 2013 UTC,"Fortunately, the words spoken in a healing blessing are not essential to its healing effect. If faith is sufficient and if the Lord wills it, the afflicted person will be healed or blessed whether the officiator speaks those words or not. Conversely, if the officiator yields to personal desire or inexperience and gives commands or words of blessing in excess of what the Lord chooses to bestow according to the faith of the individual, those words will not be fulfilled. Consequently, brethren, no elder should ever hesitate to participate in a healing blessing because of fear that he will not know what to say. The words spoken in a healing blessing can edify and energize the faith of those who hear them, but the effect of the blessing is dependent upon faith and the Lord’s will, not upon the words spoken by the elder who officiated.   LOVE IT!  So comforting!"
lds,164z1k,MrWienerDawg,2,Mon Jan 7 23:37:53 2013 UTC,"My experience is that I speak and hope that I'm saying the right things. I have never had the feeling that the words were coming from outside myself, and this talk was comforting in that respect."
lds,164z1k,C0unt_Z3r0,3,Tue Jan 8 19:08:19 2013 UTC,"This is the best talk I've ever heard on the subject.  Even though this talk was given in the Priesthood session, I personally think every member of the church should read it."
lds,164z1k,keledor,5,Tue Jan 8 15:11:22 2013 UTC,"I will definitely check this one out, thank you.  Always love talks from Apostles that give nice and clear instruction."
