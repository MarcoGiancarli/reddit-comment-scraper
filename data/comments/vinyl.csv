vinyl,3e2h75,kunoburesu,8,Tue Jul 21 16:18:48 2015 UTC,"Hey everyone, I wanted to share another rare find I pulled out while still trudging through organizing my collection.  I present to you, for your viewing pleasure, my copy of Songs for the Deaf, one of the greatest albums of all time.  As a personal note, I build tube amplifiers as a past time (yes, I would love to build hifi stereo units, but for now it's just guitar) and some albums speak to the process.  This album oozes amplifier worship, and just feels right when building.  This copy has the alternate cover, instead of the pitchfork, it has the spermy Q.  Looking around at other copies, that detail limited down which version this was.  Barcode helped as well.  This release is apparently the rarest and most sought after copy of the record.  It is missing the parental advisory on it (which I missed when taking photos).  It also has a small flower on the runout (I tried to grab a photo), which I guess is the sign of the only Ipecac official copy.  You can read some more about the release here: http://www.discogs.com/Queens-Of-The-Stone-Age-Songs-For-The-Deaf/release/577250  As a final note: Did not notice the price.  Holy hell in a hand basket, that is a pricey LP for sure."

vinyl,3e2h75,xxsilence,3,Tue Jul 21 19:04:56 2015 UTC,This is a bootleg. As are 95% of the copies floating around.  Edit for proof - it should be IPC-43 for a legit copy. Any 41 are boots.
vinyl,3e2h75,Wizard-in--Black,-3,Tue Jul 21 14:44:16 2015 UTC,"Nah, OP's copy is definitely legit.  It has the flower in the run-out which signifies authenticity as it's the trademark of Brian Gardner, the guy who mastered the album.  Also, none of the boots in the sperm-Q sleeve are on red vinyl."
vinyl,3e2h75,xxsilence,8,Tue Jul 21 14:54:51 2015 UTC,"There are plenty of sperm red bootlegs, most of them from the UK or Spain. OP is missing the parental advisory logo to be a legit copy."
vinyl,3e2h75,Wizard-in--Black,4,Tue Jul 21 15:09:17 2015 UTC,"Unless the parental advisory logo is printed on (I'm not sure if it is) then it could have easily been taken off for some reason, are possibly not put on at all.  I mean, I can't say with 100% certainty is OP's copy is genuine, but having seen photos of numerous copies and having done my homework on the album, I'd say it looks real.  edit: as far as the IPC-43 vs 41 thing goes according to this page, which is a very reliable source, original copies do have the misprinted IPC-41 catalogue number."
vinyl,3e2h75,undrt0w,2,Tue Jul 21 15:13:53 2015 UTC,It's always printed on...always...not to mention OP's catalog number is wrong for Ipecac. It's 100% a boot.
vinyl,3e2h75,Wizard-in--Black,3,Tue Jul 21 15:17:26 2015 UTC,"Actually, looking again, according to the comments on discogs, it seems to be that origins had stickers placed onto the sleeve, while boots had them printed on.  If you look at the sales history of the album, there are quite a few genuine copies that don't seem to have stickers on them.  The catalogue number is correct though.  It should have been IPC-43, but on the original US pressing they misprinted it as IPC-41, though that doesn't prove too much as the boots had the same misprint.  As far as I can work out, everything checks out on OP's copy."
vinyl,3e2h75,THElordRingading,2,Tue Jul 21 15:24:50 2015 UTC,"agreed.  I searched Discogs as my reference, and as far as I can tell, it is 100% legit original, which I think the flower is the biggest piece of info on it.  I will look for the Parental Advisory later to make sure it is missing or there."

vinyl,3e3269,BlindWillieBrown,2,Tue Jul 21 16:05:27 2015 UTC,"Okay everybody! Here's the latest crown jewel in my collection. This is Ongiara by Great Lake Swimmers.  I've been hunting this album since I started collecting records seriously years back with no luck in even seeing a physical copy let alone one nice enough to buy. Every record store I ever browsed, I had to fully scavenge the G section before leaving. Every time. After a few years I began to think I'd never find a copy and was beginning to think it was a little more rare than I thought! So, now that I'm making big boy money at my new job after graduating university I've been keeping an eye on Discogs for a good deal. After a year in the want list, one came from from a fellow Canadian seller in sealed condition for a price that didn't make me spit my coffee out. So, two weeks later, here we are.   This is an important album to me. I saw this band in Toronto (home) a few years back when they toured this album, and since then have been a very big fan and have an almost complete vinyl discography. This is one of the last pieces needed! I've seen them perform a few dozen times since that show, and have been fortunate enough to work with Tony (the singer and guitarist) on his latest solo release which was a beautiful experience. I'm a very proud Canadian who loves supporting his neighbours. I would recommend Great Lake Swimmers to anybody who enjoys mellow acoustic folk, and traditional story-telling music. The songs are simple, concise, well paced and thoughtful. Tony has a knack for taking intimate ideas and really spelling them out in an exploded view. A beautiful mind on him.   If you're a fan of very simple, solo acoustic guitar and vocals, you should start at the first album released which is solely Tony in his kitchen recording himself- heat bugs in the background and forest noise included. The latest albums have a much more rich band atmosphere and take full advantage of the budget success brings. They are lush, grand exercises in what modern folk means to me- and still retain the charm of honest songwriting.   You can look at the latest post on my Instagram for a little snippet of audio! I've also got a bunch of other records on there I really like, so maybe some of you would enjoy peepin that too. @MatthewRM"

Picked up most of the gear second hand (ridiculously good deal on speakers - $10 USD from my boss)   Overall it was roughly $300 USD to put this all together. It also works well as a 2 channel home theater and gaming setup. Not that that's impressive, but it's nice to be a bit more immersed than just TV speakers.   Sounds so good. Warm lows, biting highs.

vinyl,3e3a4s,DeuceSK,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:45:29 2015 UTC,"Not common, I scoured shops for a long time, never came across one in the wild. It's said that it was pressed in relatively low quantities. I ended up buying one from a redditor on /r/vinyl, although the condition is not really as it was described it's not such a great sounding record anyhow. Early digital LP mastering, kinda sucks. The master is digital, but If they master from the right sources then this has a great chance of sounding better than the original, picture disc or not."
vinyl,3e3a4s,MrRom92,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:59:24 2015 UTC,The shop near me has 4 copies. I don't see it often but its out there.

vinyl,3e3a4s,MrRom92,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:09:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah I couldn't find any more details on how it's been mastered, but i fear this may be a purchase more for the nostalgia and novelty."
vinyl,3e3hin,Ksonger15,2,Tue Jul 21 17:50:34 2015 UTC,weird.  i had a tab open in chrome from the original posting in /r/vinyl about this still up.  i clicked your link and saw the not available and freaked out.  went back to the old window and somehow i was able to still pre-order.  could i have lucked out?  edit:  i feel your pain.  i passed on buying this in a record shop when the OP was released and have regretted it ever since.  the pain is real.

Just now I saw my amazon cart with ""1"" in it forgetting that I impusively put it in there two days ago when I first saw the link but just never processed it - I wanted to see if it would show up in Canada's site.  Looks like it allowed me to process the purchase right now; so I have no idea if it will go through or if I will end up with a sad email from Amazon couple of weeks from now that they already sold out by the time I bought it."

With the research I have gathered and the thoughts from some here, I decided it was time to upgrade my Sony turntable I bought at Best Buy.   I decided on the Pro-Ject Debut Carbon after the owner of the record store I frequent highly recommended the Debut Carbon. It is the one he uses in store. It was also very reasonable in terms of price.  The first thing I played was Kind of Blue by Miles Davis. My god, it is a totally new experience. Thank you to all who pushed me towards this decision.  Here are some more pictures of my setup.

I was just looking into getting one to keep my receiver from overheating.  I was warned against stacking anything on top of the receiver and that 6 inches of clearance (above the receiver) is recommended.  Similarly, I wonder if you should relocate the xbox?  Maybe other redditors can comment?"
vinyl,3dyggd,kcxzoo,2,Mon Jul 20 22:50:29 2015 UTC,"This is the post I've been hoping to see! I too have a baseline Sony (PS-LX250). It's about as basic as you can get. It's at least 15 years old, probably the original cartridge... but it was a free hand-me-down from a friend. While I'm grateful for a free turntable to spin my collection, I can't help but imagine how big the difference would be with a quality turntable. I've had my eye on the Carbon Debut. I've been setting money aside for an upgrade hoping that when the day comes, I will immediately be blown away by the difference in sound quality. I trust your ears, man! Thanks for the reassurance."

Or do you basically have a good idea of what you're getting into and as long as you can find a good deal or someone to set it up for you at home you're set?  Also, does it matter if you have to wait a bit to get the color/configuration you want versus being able to go home the same day with the stuff you want?"

vinyl,3e2t1v,Ayn-Reagan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:59:01 2015 UTC,"40watts?   IMO You could pick up some really high quality separates for less $$, if you didn't mind used gear. I bought a Carver C1 preamp and a B&K ST1400II (125w@8ohm/185w@4ohm) for around $400, total.  Those were average ebay prices, btw. If you have more restraint than I, you can get them cheaper. Also, if you scour local pawnshops you should get a much better deal.  I have looked into NAD stuff in the past. Great sounding gear, but always seemed to have quality issues.  I like B&K. Sounds warm, good for jazz and such. Rock solid dependability. There is an older B&K (st140) that is slightly lower power that usually sells for way less than what I paid for the ST1400II.  Edit: in keeping with the vinyl theme of the sub: I picked up this lovely Brubeck record at the local thrift store yesterday for 90¢. Great score."
vinyl,3e2t1v,beerhawk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:42:04 2015 UTC,"Additional notes, the Carver C-1preamp has a built in phono stage that is really nice and allows for capacitance loading. So, depending on what preamp you get to go with your amp... you might get to try out an additional phono stage anyway. (carver, adcom, rotel...many choices here, even NAD)  As far as speakers, I've never really been impressed by Pioneer... I would probably try to find a nicer pair of used speakers on Craigslist."

I was finally able to acquire this for a reasonable price and I couldn’t be happier with it. Everything is in good condition and it sounds great for an album pressed in the late 90’s. This album is highly regarded among hardcore fans and is my favorite studio album of theirs, by far.  Discogs Link for the release page.  About a month ago I also posted my entire Dave Matthews Band vinyl collection; here is a link to the photo album with some descriptions and annotations and thread for more detail on my collection (including Before These Crowded Streets); if anyone is interested."

While I haven't cared much for DMB since I was at JMU in 99, I'd hate to see your post go unnoticed. Happy for you, especially considering the album goes for $200 - $500."
vinyl,3e0rnq,Hopczar420,3,Tue Jul 21 03:00:25 2015 UTC,"Well thanks, I appreciate that! I figured most of r/vinyl would either not care or actively downvote because they don't like DMB, but I don't care too much about internet points and just wanted to share.  Since you mentioned Pearl Jam, if you have ever listen to it, is an original pressing of Ten worth getting? I have the semi-recent re-issue and am not impressed with the sound quality. Any idea if the original is worth it?"
vinyl,3e0rnq,datraceman,2,Tue Jul 21 03:09:01 2015 UTC,"I have not heard the original on vinyl. My wife gave me the repress and i hardly listen to that one as it is, but it has the original mix and the remix on two lps so i don't see myself shelling out the dough for another. Id rather grab a copy of Yield or Binaural first. Hoping the rest of the catalog gets a repress bc prices are a little absurd."
vinyl,3e0rnq,sarcastic_jerk,2,Tue Jul 21 03:19:55 2015 UTC,"I can answer this - the original press of Ten wasn't great, really thin vinyl and lots of surface noise.  The repress of the original mix is a better pressing, I had the opportunity to A-B the two and would not recommend shelling out the cash for an original unless for collection purposes."

My wife got me the BTCS vinyl for my 30th birthday and it is one of my most prized possessions. I know she paid more than you, somewhere in the 300 range, but it's a great copy that I have listened to many times.  Great collection, we have most of the same stuff. The reason I got into collecting vinyl was because of the first RSD release for DMB. I got my hands on volume 1, and have picked up every one since.  Congrats and enjoy listening to a great album on a great platform."
vinyl,3e0rnq,the_thinwhiteduke,2,Tue Jul 21 13:30:29 2015 UTC,I've been disappointed by everything they've done after Busted Stuff.  But before that they were fantastic.  Doesn't get any better than the beautiful transition from #41 to Say Goodbye on Crash.  I'd love to see a proper release of the Lillywhite sessions.
vinyl,3e0rnq,fritztopher,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:58:32 2015 UTC,"I'm with you. In fact, Busted Stuff was a bit of a let down to me too, after having heard the Lillywhite Sessions. They completely butchered Captain, though I do enjoy the addition of You Never Know.   If they ever pressed the original masters from tLS, I would buy that at all costs."

After being told of my foolishness, you guys kindly looked through Craigslist and found some awesome deals around me. Special shout out to /u/gtfokenny for finding a link to someone selling a turntable, receiver, and speakers; because I was able to contact that guy and pick everything up the next day for only a hundred bucks!!   I could not be happier, not only because the sound quality is amazing and I am now able to listen to my new records (RAM shown here) without fear of them getting messed up by my crapola player; but I also found out that the records I had that I thought were warped because of how bad they sounded on my other player are actually totally fine and sound amazing on this system.

vinyl,3dz6u3,Bologna_Sandw1ch,6,Mon Jul 20 19:54:32 2015 UTC,"Consider moving your speakers a bit further apart and pulling them away from the wall 5-10 inches. Ideally you want them seperated 2/3 the distance of your seating position. So if you're sitting 9 feet away, put 6 feet between them and angle them inward slightly."

vinyl,3e36ib,crisisred,3,Tue Jul 21 16:36:03 2015 UTC,"Be patient and keep looking. I have 4 sets of Polks that I use all the time. SDA 2 , CRS, Monitor 10s and a newer pair which model number escapes me. All of them cost me around $75. I found two sets of other speakers in the last month. Both cost $10. One is a pair of Infinity Reference Studio Monitors with the awesome ribbon tweeter. The other is a pair of EPI speakers. Both of these have surrounds in excellent condition.  Other speakers to keep an eye out for are JBL, AR, B&W, KEF. Search the model number posted in the add and read the reviews.   Polks would probably be no good for you with tubes because they are very power hungry. I drive my SDA 2's with a 300w power amp and they still want more. Polks have rubber surrounds so the following is usually not a problem. It is important to check the foam surrounds on vintage speakers. The foam has a tendency to break down over time and may need replacement. Not difficult and inexpensive to do yourself. Not so cheep if you have to have a shop do it."
vinyl,3e36ib,Loud_Vinyl_Disks,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:02:26 2015 UTC,Cool thanks!  Yeah I just have to be patient I guess
vinyl,3e36ib,mpelleg459,2,Tue Jul 21 17:14:33 2015 UTC,"There is a sticky thread with a google doc that is still updated (maybe?) at AVS forums that lists high efficiency speakers that also meet other criteria: http://www.avsforum.com/forum/89-speakers/1387083-list-reference-level-high-sensitivity-spl-speakers.html  I doubt you can find them used, or at much of a discount, but Zu Audio makes very efficient speakers; their Omen towers start at $1500 per pair though."

vinyl,3e36ib,JaisBit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:09:02 2015 UTC,"Well, with tube amps, you definitely want speakers that are efficient. I have a pair of the Klipsch Heresy IIIs, which are very efficient speakers. They seem somewhat divisive among audiophiles, who either love them or hate them, but I think they're great. However, those will run you about $1,600 new for a pair. I lucked out and found a guy on Craigslist (I also live in Los Angeles) who sold me his pair for $700.   Outside of the Heresy IIIs and the other speakers in Klipsch's Heritage line, which are all made to order in Arkansas, I've heard that Klipsch has gone down in quality, and most of their mainstream speakers are made in China.   Sorry, I haven't really done enough research on other brands to give you more specific advice, but you should probably start by narrowing down your search to speakers with a 95db or higher efficiency, and work from there.   You could also check these out: https://losangeles.craigslist.org/sfv/ele/5105102569.html  Based on the serial number, I'm pretty sure they were manufactured in 1985, so you'll want to find out if they've ever had the crossovers replaced. I would also try to talk him down from $900, which seems high."

vinyl,3e36ib,JaisBit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:45:23 2015 UTC,"Tough call. For $850, 30-year-old speakers with the original crossovers are a bit of a gamble. No matter how well taken care of those speakers are, they're going to break down over time. It would be a drag to spend $850, and then have to spend another $150 or $200 to get them sounding their best."
vinyl,3e36ib,nameplace24,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:52:34 2015 UTC,Yeah and $850 is already pretty steep  Some people just don't want to meet go of things
vinyl,3e2qpd,IakushkoTandel,2,Tue Jul 21 14:40:34 2015 UTC,"You should check the connections for the left side, going from the cartridge to the tonearm, the table to your amp/phono. It's obviously not the output that's the problem. Check to see if any of the wires on the cartridge are touching or loose. The other thing to check would be a loose connection between the table and the amp either in the amp or on the table."

On Sunday, I'm idly flipping through crates at CHIRP's tent because they had some signings the day before. I come across both Madhouse records, which I had just recently learned were instrumental jazz albums performed almost solely by Prince in the late '80s and released anonymously. Furthermore, they are promo copies. I mention these to the guy behind the table, and he leads me to the Eric Leeds album, produced by Prince and released in '91. (He's a sax player who featured on the Madhouse albums.) I felt like I was making Questlove proud. The best part is this only cost $10 total."

Like Marcy Playground and Harvey Danger...Everclear is a band that was popular on the 1990s mostly, and have a solid discography. I think Everclear is the most popular of the the bands I've mentioned so far, however the last I've listened to. I bought Songs from an American Movie on CD for 50 cents near a couple years ago, as a start to checking out the band, and I've since expanded my collection of their CDs.  My first everclear 12 inch, this release is very good, in my opinion. You get the cstchiness of their 90s material, but now there is some good mixing going on. Side 1 is definitely stronger than 2. I'm glad to own it."
vinyl,3e0ezi,jakegamz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:14:40 2015 UTC,"Don't underestimate what a good cart can do. I think it's the most important part in the chain. You could have the best  amplification and speakers in the world but if you fail to pickup a good sound to start with, nothing down the chain will be able to help that. I second /u/adayinalife's advice but I also say you should invest a bit of that budget into a new cart. The onkyo you have probably does not have a great phono stage in it but even that is significantly better than what's built into the lp120, so you may be set on that front unless you're looking to do even better. For now I'd just worry about removing the pre-amp, finding good speakers you'll be able to use with your receiver, and upgrading the cart. And no, a subwoofer is generally not necessary on a good set of speakers, even modest ones are generally good at reproducing down into the single Hz range."
vinyl,3e0ezi,MrRom92,2,Tue Jul 21 01:00:18 2015 UTC,A little off topic from what you said but could I just bypass the preamp in the lp120 for now. I know the best solution is to remove it but i don't feel comfortable opening up my tt and screwing with it. I plan on getting a different tt in the far future (maybe 2 or 3 years) so could i just use the bypass switch for the time being.
vinyl,3e0ezi,MrRom92,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:07:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, for the time being that will still be a lot better. I personally don't have any experience with performing the mod, nor have I had the chance to compare an unmodded and modded setup, so I can't personally say how much better it is than just simply bypassing it. But I imagine that just bypassing it would at least get you halfway there and anything has gotta be better than what's built into it. So you'll be fine :)"
vinyl,3e0ezi,adayinalife,2,Tue Jul 21 01:10:37 2015 UTC,Thanks a bunch for the info
vinyl,3e0ezi,MrRom92,2,Tue Jul 21 01:22:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, not a bad idea. Perhaps an OM30 stylus? Or would that be overkill for a LP120?"
vinyl,3e0ezi,adayinalife,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:09:51 2015 UTC,"Definitely not overkill, but I think better could be done for the money. The stylus alone costs more than a new m97xe cart + SAS stylus, which handily outperforms any of the OM series (even the 2M line). I used to use one too, stepped up a few times since then to something with a finer stylus assembly, each step was more resolving than the last."
vinyl,3e0ezi,MrRom92,2,Tue Jul 21 01:16:40 2015 UTC,"m97xe cart + SAS stylus   You post such great reviews about this combo, it is so tempting to buy it as a spare, perhaps start a 2nd setup :P"

vinyl,3e1sem,MOONGOONER,7,Tue Jul 21 12:37:29 2015 UTC,"The concept of a Holy Grail record store is beyond me. A Holy Grail insinuates that you've been searching forever for it and now that you've found it you have everything. Can a record store be a Holy Grail? Are you finished visiting other record stores now that you found it?  Personally, I've been there and I favor my little local record store in NC much more than Amoeba. Their prices were too high and the few goodies they did have were out of range because of it. They had more space but that also meant more filler and junk. I'm sure they get a lot of rare new releases, but so does my local shop and I don't have to rush or fight dozens of people to snag them. It's not like I wouldn't visit Amoeba again, but it's also not a place where I found more than I'd find on an average trip to my local shop.   That being said, my favorite record store ever is Double Decker Records in Allentown, PA around 10-13 years ago. Tiny shop in the middle of eastern PA, about an hour north of Philly. Just about every time I went there I walked out with a rarity that I had been hunting and the prices were always on par with regular pressings. That shop was killer at the time. Haven't been there in about 10 years though, so it may still be just as good these days."
vinyl,3e1sem,one800higgins,3,Tue Jul 21 11:31:25 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Many that are new to the hobby view every one of their favorite albums as ""Grails""; and when they find a large record shop that stocks a huge amount of new vinyl they tend to freak out."
vinyl,3e1sem,thesneakywalrus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:08:09 2015 UTC,"I blame the Internet. Not that this is a bad thing. For instance, my buddy (who is by no means new to vinyl either) asked me what I would consider a ""grail"" last year. I answered with my most sought after record and then for my birthday, I got it. My girlfriend found it online and was willing to pay the high price to make me happy. And I was!  But on the same note... Is it really a grail if it just required going online and paying a high price?  In my opinion, grails are an idea that is largely non-existent to the average collector these days. They require true hunting and bin diving for years. I honestly don't have anything I'd consider a grail now because I know that every desire I would want is a click and credit card statement away.   However there are plenty out there hunting what I would consider real grails and I hope they find them. Many are on this subreddit.

I agree that there are still plenty of grails out there, especially depending on the genres and generations of music you favor.

The white stripes obviously, their earlier albums.  Punk:  Wire-Pink flag is a great classic  If you're looking for something more hardcore esc, Swain is great (their music is on bandcamp)  Singer Songwriter:  Sun kil moon- Benji  Hip Hop:  Madvilliany-Madvillian  Kendrick Lamar- To pimp a butterfly (has some jazz influences also)  Mick jenkins - the water[s] was my introduction to hip hop.

vinyl,3dzxfu,dftba171,2,Tue Jul 21 02:32:02 2015 UTC,"this would otherwise take a lot of effort so I'm going to offer an abridged list of things I'm digging right now:   The Meters - s/t [funk] Jungle - s/t [soul/electronic] Son House - Father of Folk Blues [blues]. I can't stress enough how essential this record is to build a foundational blues collection. It often gets overlooked by Robert Johnson's ""King of the Delta Blues Singers"" or John Lee Hooker's ""That's My Story"", though you should consider those two as well. Sufjan Stevens - Carrie & Lowell [singer/songwriter]. This record will likely win a lot of awards this year   If you don't have any Bob Dylan records, you should get any or all of his first 7 studio releases. I'm trepidatious about post-Hard Rain Bob Dylan, so, personally, I'd start with the earlier stuff. Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits is an awesome album to get if you want a survey of those first seven studio releases + ""Positively 4th Street,"" an absolutely amazing track released only as a single in 1965 in between Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde. Okay, actually, get the Greatest Hits (cause it'll be easy to find and should be relatively inexpensive), and then either The Times They Are a-Changin' (if you want the folky/protesty/whiney Dylan) or Blonde on Blonde (if you want to see Dylan go electric, but still stay true to his singer-songwriter sensibilities as evident by the tracks ""Visions of Johanna,"" ""Just Like a Woman,"" and, the epic, ""Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands"").  Get some Tom Waits. Either Closing Time, The Heart of Saturday Night, Nighthawks at the Diner, Blue Valentine, or Rain Dogs.  I'm sorry that this wasn't necessarily what you asked for, but I hope it helps.  Oh, also - for jazz, check out: 1) Ellington at Newport; 2) Lee Morgan - The Sidewinder; and, 3) Wayne Shorter - Night Dreamer. You can't go wrong with 60s Blue Note."

My best advice would be to go crazy with anything that's $5 or less and looks like it might be cool. But I'll provide some suggestions anyway and I'll try to stray from the beaten path a bit.   • Garage Rock - when I think garage rock I think 45rpm. It's not really an ""album"" genre. Buy the most obscure thing you can get your hands on without breaking the bank.   • Punk - The Buzzcocks ""A different Kind of Tension"", Suicidal Tendencies S/t, ""Nevermind the Bollocks Here Are The Sex Pistols""  • Singer/Songwriter - Simon & Garfunkel ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"", Billy Joel ""The Stranger"", Kevin Devine Live At Looney Tunes  • Electronic - walter/Wendy Carlos (switched on Bach), old Kraftwerk, club 12"" singles are always cool  • Blues - you got a 78 rpm speed on there? :P aside from older blues sides try for classic electric blues albums, like Zeppelin, Cream, Blind Faith, etc.   • Soul - Isaac Hayes ""Hot Buttered Soul"", ""Shaft"", Stevie Wonder ""Songs In The Key Of Life""  • Hip-Hop - again, a great 12"" singles format more so than albums. Beastie Boys ""Licensed To Ill"" is a great old school one though. See if you can get yourself a 12"" of Rapper's Delight, that record is pretty much the birth of hip hop right there.   Jazz - Seriously any 50's era pressing from any of the dedicated jazz labels is a good buy. Blue Note, Prestige, Fantasy, Pacific, Aladdin, Norgran, etc. you won't go wrong with any of these. If your store has any of the Blue Note 45RPM reissues, try one of those. do get Time Out by the Dave Brubeck Quartet if you can (older pressings or 1990s era Classic 45 RPM pressing preferred), John Coltrane ""A Love Supreme (45rpm only, impulse is another good label to look at though) Miles Davis ""Bitches Brew"""

I have a 1964 Magnavox console that sounded great after I repaired it! I've personally been to a place in Cincinnati that repairs stuff like this, but I know Nashville also has 3 different guys that repair this kind of stuff! It won't sound as good as a brand new setup, but it's a cool piece, and it will still sound pretty good."
vinyl,3dvyq7,squeezyphresh,8,Mon Jul 20 01:50:06 2015 UTC,"Thing is, the techs can be expensive.  They usually want $40-$100 an hour.  The time spent to replace old electrolytics, caps, speakers, etc. could get you into a very good pair of kit speakers that will run circles around this.  You could also pick up a decent receiver that would be leagues ahead of this.  I know people get excited about old consoles, but they have poor performance and you can spend a lot of money and get very little in return.  Most of the classic vintage gear was sucked off the market nearly ten years ago.  The good stuff has usually been restored and commands prices similar to new gear.  The only vintage gear that seems undervalued are old integrated tube amps from Stromberg-Carlson.  Stromberg-Carlson was a great manufacturer back in the day and if you want a decent tube integrated, you can find unrestored ones for $150-$300.  You will have to recap them and probably replace all the resistors while you're in there.  Anyway, the console market is dead for a reason.  They weren't much good when new and the audio cognoscenti wants nothing to do with them."
vinyl,3dvyq7,Uncle_Erik,2,Mon Jul 20 04:55:24 2015 UTC,"That's not at all how it worked for me. I spent $112 dollars to fix my console. All they did was replace the caps and fix the weight of the arm. No need to do half the thing you are saying, and I haven't had to go back yet. Of course it depends on the condition of the thing, but his looks like it'd be an easy fix since it is smaller and not as old. It is the huge console that they will hit you with a lot of fees for. As I said, it doesn't sound as good as buying a brand new turntable, but it's still a cool thing to own, and can definitely work as a secondary player. People aren't buying these things for how they sound, they are buying them because they are part of vinyl history."

vinyl,3dvyq7,cakemaaaan,5,Mon Jul 20 05:23:00 2015 UTC,"This is my ""new"" 1970's (I think) RCA Record Player. This was a bonus when I bought my home. The previous owners left it behind and had no interest in taking it with them. It works, I dusted and cleaned it and it kicked right on! It also plays 8-track tapes and of course AM/FM radio. The left speaker is likely damaged based on the sound, so I cranked the balance over to the right a bit and the sound cleaned right up.  They left some of the records and all the 8-tracks in the photo, but some of the pictured records are my additions. Some of them haven't been played for over thirty years and were handed down to me after my grandmother passed away last week.  My mom was so happy to know that these records were being played again after so long! We got pretty choked up listening to Freddie Mercury coming through those speakers.  Let me know what you guys think! And if anyone has resources for fixing these old things (specifically the speakers) I would appreciate it."
vinyl,3dvyq7,Uncle_Erik,8,Mon Jul 20 00:08:40 2015 UTC,"First, I'm sorry about your grandmother.  But you don't want to put much money into this.  It wasn't very good when new and it isn't worth much now.  The speakers are old paper cone drivers that you won't find replacements for unless you cannibalize another unit.  Installing modern drivers probably wouldn't work.  You'd have to design cabinets that fit inside and brace them in there.  You would be much, much better off building kit speakers from Madisound, Parts Express or Meniscus.  I don't want to get too deeply into it, but speakers have come a long way since around 2000, when it became possible to model drivers, cabinets and crossovers with computers.  In the past several years, these tools have become inexpensive enough for hobbyists to design DIY speakers.  Newer speakers are two or three orders of magnitude better than these.  Further, designing speakers is tough, it takes years of learning.  Even some of the most experienced designers (like the famed Sigfried Linkwitz) will take input from builders of their designs and release new iterations.  Further, the problem might not be in the speakers.  Poor output could be a bad crossover or one of the channels on the amp dying.  It could be a number of things.  The circuit and design are cheap and not worth restoring, assuming it doesn't need replacement transistors that have been out of production for 30 years.  Old transistors can be impossible to find - I couldn't find some for a phonostage designed in 2007 that I was thinking about building.  It would probably cost a similar amount to build a new preamp and amp.  And if you built modern stuff, you'd have much better sound quality, not to mention having to desolder an old PCB that might get damaged during a restoration.  Finally, even if you did restore this, it probably wouldn't bring more than $50-$100 on Craigslist.  If you have someone do the work and replace the speakers, you might get $500-$1,000 into it.  Again, I urge you to consider modern gear instead.  $1,000 will get you incredible performance with new gear, especially if you DIY it."

I replaced the stylus twice in 6 years, never taught about the cartridge since it was the original (the table comes from a community radio station)...  Am I drestroying my records ? Should I replace the cartridge for something else?  EDIT I should add that I'm pretty good at keeping my recordsand stylus dust-free. Wet-cleaning them almost weekly."
vinyl,3dvyq7,mawnck,2,Mon Jul 20 14:05:56 2015 UTC,"Shure SC35C   SL-1200s didn't come with an ""original"" cart. You had to buy your own. That one would be a typical choice for a radio station.   That cart should only be used for DJ-ing. You aren't exactly destroying your records (well, OK, if you're actually scratching with them you are, but that's another story), however you are getting more wear-and-tear than if you upgraded to a ""real"" hi-fi cart.  And there is no reason to wet-clean your records that often. Unless you're smoking/vaping around them or handling them carelessly, one wet-clean should be good for the duration. Just dry brush after that."
vinyl,3dvyq7,lanceailleurs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:15:21 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I will look into a cartridge more suited for my use. I come from the TV broadcast field. SL1200s were in every studios. It was easy (and cheap) for me to acquire one.  For the cleaning: I smoke and live with the windows open close to what should be considered a highway. I do not play records each week as I often work on contracts out of the city (and I'm the ""outdoors"" type in summer). By ""weekly"" I meant : I'll probably clean the records I listened to / sat out of the sleeves all week on Sundays, like I vacuum the living room's carpet ""weekly"" ."
vinyl,3dvyq7,mawnck,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:50:04 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. But I would strongly encourage you to not leave records sitting out of the sleeves, period, unless they're in use. (On the TT with the dust cover down is acceptable.)"
vinyl,3dvyq7,Fracking_Toasters,2,Mon Jul 20 18:55:38 2015 UTC,"The player looks to be in good shape. I'd see if you can find a new needle or cartridge for it. Needlefinder.com is pretty good. Likely the speakers, or more specifically the foam in the speakers is toast. It really depends on how much you want to invest in this. Personally I like cool pieces like this, but they're not kosher in the ""true"" vinyl community as they track heavy and if you listen to the same record on it thousands of times it will eventually wear it out. People basically give these away on Craig's List all the time, so it's not worth much, but if you want to keep it and play it, with some research and probably $60-70 you can get it sounding ok again. It's never going to be a reference quality system, but they do have a certain nostalgia to them. I know a bit about electronics, there are certainly people here that know more than me, but if you have questions, feel free to ask.

I wouldn't buy one just for the turntable though unless I was looking for a good 78 player"
vinyl,3dvyq7,TheJokersChild,2,Tue Jul 21 06:36:49 2015 UTC,"That's a sweet find. RCA got out of home audio in '75, so this might be from just before then.  As far as the left speaker being ""damaged,"" what do you mean? Does it crackle? Cut out? Just sound bad no matter what? My bet is that dust got into the controls. That's a common thing that's cheap to fix with a can of Deox-IT.  On ruining records: yeah, might not get the tender loving care a standalone turntable would give. Mainly since changers were designed to have up to 6 records on the platter at once, and that could seriously screw with the tracking angle of the tonearm. But nobody said you can't use it to play just one record at a time.  The general rule is that these things track super heavy. But you know what? I haven't seen anyone with a stylus force gauge prove it for real on a player like this. Magnavox made a thing in the '60s about how its turntables tracked at a tenth of an ounce - a little less than 3 grams. Some Zenith changers tracked at 2 grams (hence the name Microtouch 2G). And some of these changers do allow for the same adjustments that single-players do.  So if you like the sound and it's in good enough shape, enjoy it!"

vinyl,3dyvqi,NervousBacker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:09:32 2015 UTC,"These four elements are needed to get sound from a record:   Turntable Phono Stage (aka Phono Preamp) Amplifier Speakers   Some newer turntables come with the phono stage built-in. Most turntables do not and will need an separate phono stage. Some speakers come with the amplifier built-in (usually music mixing monitors or computer speakers). Most speakers do not have a built-in amplifier and will need an separate one. Commonly, the separate amplifier will be in the form of a piece of equipment known as a receiver. Most receivers made before the year 2000 have a phono stage built-in. Most modern receivers do not and will need a separate phono stage.  Here are some possible setups: * Turntable (w/ built-in Phono Stage) -> Powered Speakers * Turntable -> Phono Stage -> Powered Speakers * Turntable (w/ built-in Phono Stage) -> Receiver -> Speakers * Turntable -> Phono Stage -> Receiver -> Speakers * Turntable -> Receiver (w/ built-in Phono Stage) -> Speakers   Your Audio Technica PL50 has a built-in phono stage.

In the specs it will usually list if it has automatic features.  As far as new goes, the two I can think of are the Denon DP-300f and the Pioneer PL-30-K, both of which are fully automatic (auto-start and auto-return).

For Beatles fans who aim to have a complete discography, I suppose having a counterfeit album isn't truly a Beatles album, despite the music being the same.

Here's a couple of videos (the second one is probably at the best level to judge, and it's after I removed the platter)  https://www.dropbox.com/s/3vojxjwwlojwfgy/IMG_1084.MOV?dl=0  https://www.dropbox.com/s/a6io8h46nkcmmbk/IMG_1092.MOV?dl=0  I made an earlier post regarding this issue, and it seems like it won't be audible (I haven't heard it). I took the platter off and the spindle doesn't seem loose, so my only guess is the platter isn't plumb. When I put it back on it seemed to reduce slightly. Hopefully it won't cause any excess wear (which is what I'm worried about).  So my dilemma is to stick with it and install the new cartridge I purchased, the Audio Technica AT311EP.  Or,  return the cartridge and put the money I paid for it towards a vintage table, possibly a slightly better one with a standard cartridge mount, with a budget of anything up to £150.  Or,  return the cartridge and save the money for a new table, like the RP1 or similar offering from Pro-ject, with a budget of around £250.

Original pressings of Phish’s first live box set, New Year’s Eve 1995, will also be available. The store will be equipped with vinyl listening stations and copies to pick up, open, read, feel and smell (they mostly smell waxy).  In addition (and the part we’re most excited for), the JEMP Records Store will also feature an exclusive, brand new Phish vinyl release. Yep, that’s right. Phish’s 1993 album Rift will be available for the first time on vinyl at Magnaball. The festival version will be pressed on 180-gram water-blue vinyl and is packaged with a Limited Edition screen print (a Rift continuation) by David Welker.  The remainder of the limited run of “Rift” will be made available at Phish Dry Goods and in Stores (this won’t be on blue vinyl, however) in the middle of September"

vinyl,3e0vlm,mrfalconer,3,Tue Jul 21 02:30:07 2015 UTC,You should be able to get a Planer 3 with a RB300 for that price.
vinyl,3e0vlm,adayinalife,0,Tue Jul 21 02:38:34 2015 UTC,Sorry for the naiveté—are you suggesting that the RB300 is the better tonearm and therefore this listing is a bit overpriced?
vinyl,3e0vlm,adayinalife,3,Tue Jul 21 02:44:30 2015 UTC,"Correct, the RB300 is a nicer tonearm and you can definitely get a Planer 3 for that price with one.  I'd say around $325-350 would be a reasonable price for one with a Acos arm, which is on the same level as the RB200."
vinyl,3e0vlm,iam23skidoo,2,Tue Jul 21 03:05:27 2015 UTC,"I'd say that is extremely fair and would buy at that price if it were local. Make sure and give it a test run. Any reputable dealer should be able to service it for you. Rega's don't generally have many moving parts and are easy to work on. With this, you're getting the upgraded platter, and belt (depending on if its been replaced). My main concern would be any vibration or noise coming from the motor."
vinyl,3e0vlm,t90fan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:44:37 2015 UTC,"The Planar 3 is a GREAT deck but that is an odd tonearm.  I paid £180 (so like 300-350 US?) for my Planar 3 with the RB300 arm an an ortofon 520 cart, working (new belt and needle). That arm and cart were the factory-installed ones from when it was new.  Get one with the RB300, thats the best arm for the planar 3, its realy nice, mine sounds at least as good or better than my fathers Project DC.  Also, not sure if thats the original platter. Mine is glass but has a slight greeny tint.  My Planar 3 with RB300"
vinyl,3e0ixq,TheVinylCountdownRK,3,Tue Jul 21 00:47:07 2015 UTC,"The jump start/skip at the edge is quite common with that table.  It's the cueing lever that drops it too quickly.  If you have steady hands, try dropping it manually - guaranteed it wouldnt skip.  If you dont have steady hands, bring to the edge of the lp and then start the tt - either way you will find that it wont skip 5-10seconds into the first song"
vinyl,3e0ixq,Ksonger15,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:59:23 2015 UTC,"The jump start/skip at the edge is quite common with that table.   Note that if this happens several times, you're going to wind up with scratches that make the skipping permanent.   The secret to safe manual start is to rest your wrist on the plinth."
vinyl,3e0ixq,mawnck,2,Tue Jul 21 13:39:28 2015 UTC,That's a relatively minor warp and should really not affect play. I'd try recalibrating the tonearm from scratch and make sure your turntable is on even ground (use a spirit level).   If that doesn't fix it inspect the part of the record that skips with a magnifying glass and see if there is any damage.
vinyl,3e0ixq,adayinalife,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:14:27 2015 UTC,I tired recalibrating the tone arm earlier and that didn't slove the problem. I will try again though just to make sure. The minor warp on the platter doesn't affect play for the record pictured but for another record that is ever so slightly warped it does. The warped record is brand new. Is it possible that the minor warp in the platter plus the slightly warped record is causing a problem?
vinyl,3e0ixq,adayinalife,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:29:16 2015 UTC,"Usually it should be able to track it with no problem, my tonearm has tracked some pretty warped records without a hitch. Re calibrate tonearm once more for sanity. Make sure your stylus is clean. Then I would just contact whoever you got the record from and ask for a replacement/refund."
vinyl,3e0ixq,mawnck,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:32:12 2015 UTC,"Is it possible that the minor warp in the platter plus the slightly warped record is causing a problem?   Nope. You've got a damaged or defective record, or else a problem with the stylus or tonearm calibration.   If you're set up properly, then the only way a warp can cause skipping is if it's severe enough to physically bounce the stylus out of the groove. The turntable itself won't influence things sufficiently to cause that, even if it's downright lumpy."
vinyl,3e0ixq,Loud_Vinyl_Disks,2,Tue Jul 21 13:36:18 2015 UTC,Just because you set your tracking force to 2 it doesn't mean that it is on 2. Get yourself a gram scale like this one to make sure.  http://www.amazon.com/EX-650C-Digital-Jewelry-Pocket-Weighmax/dp/B002HEIE0U  Going a quarter of a gram over is okay. Many audiophiles routinely overweight the stylus slightly.

vinyl,3e0ha2,jackholexxxx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:49:02 2015 UTC,"what's the record player though? i'm assuming it's an auto size detecting one, so there must be an adjustment somewhere to set the drop point.   otherwise drop the needle closer to the groove."

vinyl,3dzkgi,TheLastGovernment,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:11:21 2015 UTC,"What makes your receiver bad?  It's just not a quality component.  It will do the job, but the sound it will produce will probably be sub-par.  Receivers and speakers aren't like turntables where one of low quality will do any damage - so it's really a matter of what sounds best.  What will make more of a difference in terms of sound?  Generally the answer is speakers.  However, you mentioned that you are happy with the sound of the speakers.  My recommendation is to get that turntable, hook it up and see if you are happy with the sound.  It may be great for you!  If/when the upgrade bug bites id keep my eyes open for good deals on receivers and speakers and grab the best deal I found on either - then worry about the last component."

Not only did they run their own merch stand, but they also pimped and sold the local band's merch (check out Arrival of Autumn if you like Cancer Bats. They're a local band in the same vein, and pretty good), and sat and ate a the table next to ours pre-show, and they rocked out with the crowd when the opening acts were playing. After the show, Liam ran the merch stand, and they all came out to the floor and chatted with fans, except the drummer, who just disappeared (hence why there are only 3/4 autographs).  If you're a Cancer Bats fan, it's worth seeing them live. Super cool guys, hung out at the bar all night before the show (they sat at the table next to ours, and made small talk with us and other fans around them.), and were very approachable."

Each of these albums has a special place in my heart, so I wanted a physical copy of them. I'll most likely stick to new releases, but I need to find a player next.   1) Joywave - How Do You Feel Now? - This is the best release of 2015. Period. I cannot even begin to explain how much I love everything about this band. All I can say is, check this album out. It's free on Spotify. Oh, and, you're welcomed.    2) Foster the People - Torches - ""Pumped Up Kicks"" is the jam that got me into indie rock. If an album can still bring the feels after hundreds of listens, it's a keeper.      3) Joywave - How Do You Feel? - Predecessor to album 1). It's an EP & just a taste of the awesomeness that was to come.     4) Young the Giant - (self-titled) - A modern classic.    edit elaboration."

vinyl,3dz3wr,ianbro2001,4,Mon Jul 20 18:28:01 2015 UTC,+1 go for the U-turn; I love mine
vinyl,3dz3wr,joshvito,3,Mon Jul 20 18:40:56 2015 UTC,"Some people here will exaggerate the damage the LP60 will do to your records but either way, get the U-Turn. It's a much better table in every aspect.  I would highly recommend upgrading the cartridge to the OM5e. Changing cartridges is really tough on the U-Turn (balancing and setting tracking force), but with that cart you can swap out the stylus for the OM10 20 or 40 for a big upgrade.  Edit: I should clarify. People will exaggerate the damage the LP60 does to records, but speed stability and skipping are serious issues with the table and I would not recommend it."
vinyl,3dz3wr,maradonuts,3,Mon Jul 20 19:12:07 2015 UTC,"For sometime I was a supporter of the LP60 (and its sisters) as an inexpensive way to get into the vinyl hobby. At some point I started testing tracking weight (with a digital gram scale) on them when they came through the shop. Specs state that they track at 3 grams. Of the six I've taken the time to check, all have tracking weights far above the stated spec, ranging from 4.25-5.5(!) grams. I'm going to start checking alignment on them as well to see how that stacks up. Better than a Crosley, yes, but between the heavy tracking weight, known skipping issues, and general low-end assembly, it's hard for me to recommend them anymore.  I will agree that on the U-Turn it would be worth the investment and upgrade from the stock AT-91 to the Ortofon OM5e. Between the stylus upgrades and the ability to get an acrylic platter, it's a turntable that can grow with the user."
vinyl,3dz3wr,GothamCountySheriff,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:02:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah I should have clarified. I know the speed and skipping problems are big issues with the table and I wouldn't recommend it. It's not a good table by any means, but it's not going to damage your records TOO much unless you play it dozens of times. 5g of tracking force would be a lot on an elliptical stylus, but the LP60 uses a conical which spreads the force over a larger area."

From the top left:    Hand. Cannot. Erase. - Steve Wilson Haven’t actually listened to this yet; Porcupine Tree are one of my all time favourites so I’m waiting until I have time to sit and digest this properly. Angel Delight - Fairport Convention Combat Rock - The Clash Bought this because it was cheap and I was in a spree shopping mood. Side 1 has two of my favourite Clash songs (Rock the Casbah and Straight to Hell, in case you were wondering), and side 2 is a bit crackly. Sabbath Bloody Sabbath - Not going to rebuy all of my CD collection in vinyl, because that would be madness. Had to have this one, though.  Mezzanine - Massive Attack Quite possibly my favourite album of all time. Sounds gorgeous no matter which medium, but the static on Teardrop is slightly incongruous when playing an ALAC via an external DAC. The Race for Space - Public Service Broadcasting The last album I bought on CD, but I wanted to get it again, firstly for the art, secondly because I love giving this group money. In an Aeroplane Over the Sea - Neutral Milk Hotel   Vinyl hipster 101, but that doesn’t make it less of a great album.   Brothers in Arms - Dire Straits I like Dire Straits, what can I say?"

vinyl,3dvk5a,rbrthenderson,6,Sun Jul 19 21:57:18 2015 UTC,"I recently jumped into vinyl on the suggestion of a friend and I thought I'd share my small setup that I just finished this afternoon.   A friend of the family recently picked up a Marantz turntable and had this JVC AL-F333 as an extra. He had just replaced the needle as well. I had a lot of issues getting the speed correct with it as the adjustments are on the bottom so there was a lot of playing and comparing, then shutting it off and adjusting the speed below.  I picked up some Dayton B652 speakers, small Behringer preamp and small Lepy amp. I wanted to pick up some cheap gear to see if it really interested me but I've been fairly impressed with the sound I'm getting. I eventually would like to grab some better speakers and build my own tube preamp and amp as a project. For now though, this setup will work well for the smaller room I'm in.  After a quick trip to IKEA, I got the KALLAX shelf assembled and added some of their legs to it to get it up off the ground a bit. I also mounted the Lepy amp to the side of the shelf and I like that it's out of the way and not visible.  I've only got six records at the moment, some I've gotten off Amazon and some I picked up at a Half Price Bookstore. I also went to a STRFKR show last night in Dallas and they were selling the LP of the album and the 7 inch at their Merch table. For $20 I got both and the 12"" is a beautiful white vinyl. They put on an awesome show as well.  I'm really excited to delve into this more and can't wait to fill the shelves of this unit with all vinyl."
vinyl,3dvk5a,iliketunamelts,2,Sun Jul 19 22:07:51 2015 UTC,Are the legs you bought Capita? Was it difficult to install the legs into your Kallax unit? Do you think it was worth it?   I'm debating doing the same thing with a Kallax 2x2.
vinyl,3dvk5a,bjett,4,Sun Jul 19 23:03:35 2015 UTC,They are the Capita but they're the 4 inch version. They were super easy to install with a drill and the provided screws. You'll need to put them around the edges as the middle of the side pieces is hollow.  The whole shelf came together in about 45 minutes. If you join the IKEA family program for free they're running the Kallax I got for $55 and the two sets of legs were $28 total. So for the price I definitely think it's worth it.

vinyl,3dym6f,Yum_Kaax,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:32:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah; I'm not the most technical guy, but I have some real doubts about how this would react to even the even slightest warping in a record."
vinyl,3dym6f,beatlesbible,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:43:23 2015 UTC,Probably uses a heavier tracking force than is necessary for a horizontal player.
vinyl,3dym6f,mawnck,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:44:31 2015 UTC,From the campaign:   The tracking force is (dynamically) applied by a spring as opposed to the usual counterweights found in horizontal record players in which the arm is (statically) balanced. Spring loaded tracking force is beneficial in regards to consistency of the force applied—especially on warped records. Our tone-arms are factory-set at the optimal tracking force of ~2 grams.
vinyl,3dym6f,ethanfosho,4,Mon Jul 20 19:03:30 2015 UTC,"Our tone-arms are factory-set at the optimal tracking force of ~2 grams.   Which effectively leaves you stuck with the AT95E. An excellent cart in its price range ($40), but no upgrades for you."

Yes, it is better than a Crosley; yes, it looks cool; yes, it looks like something I would buy. But I wouldn't buy it. It has built in speakers that are incredibly close to the tone arm; no bueno on feedback/rumble whatever you want to call it. It has non adjustable tracking force; no bueno. The ""fully adjustable"" tone arm, isn't fully adjustable. The dynamics of the swinging tone arm with a vertical spinning record, and an offset cartridge will have too much variance on the anti-skate. Even though the builtin speakers can be bypassed, the builtin preamp has no specs, so we can assume its the same OEM kind you would find in a Crosley and an AT-LP120 at best. It can be be built well, but it is limited in what it can do as far as being a turntable because they wanted to rotate everything 90 degrees and add wood.   Don't do it. For the backing price you can get a whole vintage setup off of craigslist."
vinyl,3dym6f,Ksonger15,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:31:41 2015 UTC,Interesting that it uses spring-action to provide pressure rather than counter-weight but springs tend to warp over-time so I can already see this part being a hassel to replace.  Plus I don't see how it can counter the centripetal force because there is no anti-skate.
vinyl,3dym6f,mawnck,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:27:47 2015 UTC,Yeah...seems like it'd be really easy to send the stylus skipping across the record.
vinyl,3dym6f,Loud_Vinyl_Disks,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:44:03 2015 UTC,"I suppose only way to counter it is to use elastics that is wound to counter the CF but again that is another part that will deteoriate and quite difficult to accurately balance the force because the strength will change over time.    In all cases, I have to give it to them for creativity.  People hear are bitter about this post because this is probably the tenth time that it was posted in the last month."

Here is the owners manual for it (you will need to register for a free account): http://www.vinylengine.com/library/sony/ps-lx22.shtml  The stylus or cartridge should have markings on it denoting the model. If the turntable has the original Sony VL-5 cartridge, then getting a replacement stylus is pretty straight-forward.   Generic aftermarket replacement: http://www.ebay.com/itm/NEEDLE-for-SONY-TURNTABLE-SONY-VL5-VL-5-Aiwa-AN-7-Panasonic-EPS-76ST-209-D6T-/281199037153  Branded Audio Technica replacement: http://www.ebay.com/itm/NEEDLE-GENUINE-Audio-Technica-ATN-3710-3711-Sony-VL-5-Panasonic-EPS-76ST-209-D6T-/350628017072  JICO elliptical tip upgrade: http://www.jico-stylus.com/product_info.php?manufacturers_id=80&products_id=1463  The first two are conical (aka spherical) stylus. For the minor price difference, it would probably be best to choose the branded Audio Technica version (the Sony VL-5 cartridge was manufactured by Audio Technica and rebranded by Sony for their turntables). JICO is a quality aftermarket stylus manufacturer. The JICO elliptical stylus would be an upgrade over the standard conical and allow for more of the high-end detail to come through on playback.  As far as a platter mat (""record pad""), you can try and locate a donor rubber mat from a defunct turntable, or you can look into replacements.  Reddit /u/Station28 makes some great really cool cork platter mats with various (or even custom) graphics and your choice of fabric on the back. I had him make one as a gift for a friend of mine and it turned out fantastic.  https://www.etsy.com/shop/PickYourPoisons?section_id=15981896&ref=shopsection_leftnav_8  As to the rest of the setup, you need these four elements to get sound from a record:   Turntable Phono Stage (aka Phono Preamp) Amplifier Speakers   Some newer turntables come with the phono stage built-in. Your turntable does not and will need an separate phono stage. Some speakers come with the amplifier built-in (usually music mixing monitors). Most speakers do not have a built-in amplifier and will need an separate one. Commonly, the separate amplifier will be in the form of a piece of equipment known as a receiver. Most receivers made before the year 2000 have a phono stage built-in. Most modern receivers do not.  Here are some possible setups: * Turntable -> Phono Stage -> Powered Speakers * Turntable -> Phono Stage -> Receiver -> Speakers * Turntable -> Receiver (w/ built-in Phono Stage) -> Speakers"

vinyl,3dwgm2,adayinalife,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:44:41 2015 UTC,Used preferably. I was wondering if this set up would be good.   PYLE-PRO PP444 Ultra Compact Phono Turntable Preamp https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004HJ1TTQ/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_ANjRvbR8ME196  And connect that to   Lepai LP-2020A+ Tripath TA2020 Class-T Hi-Fi Audio Amplifier with Power Supply https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0049P6OTI/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_TOjRvb7TH7WQJ  And then connect some speakers to the amplifier. But idk if that would make the quality any worse or even work. Seeing I'm just getting into vinyl I don't need anything too expensive so anything below $100 would be ideal.
vinyl,3dwgm2,GothamCountySheriff,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:52:29 2015 UTC,"I would not recommend the Pyle phono stage. The lowest I would recommend is the Behringer PP400.  I'm not a fan of the low-power Class-D/Class-T amps. They don't have much clean power headroom and have a hard time driving modern speakers. Some people seem to be okay with that.  If you can link to your local craigslist, I can see if there is anything worthwhile."

A local bar has free shows every Wednesday night, so I went to see Yonatan Gat perform with his trio. After being blown away by the performance, I bought his album Director from him after the show.  You might already be familiar with Gat if you remember the group Monotonix. He played guitar with them.  His performance on Wednesday was spectacular. The trio (guitar, bass and drums) was very tight, energetic, with an impressive ability to push the sounds of psychedelic rock and jazz to limits of chaotic brilliance.   The record is a limited edition of 300 hand-numbered, gold inside coke bottle green. Normally I carry a sharpie in my car when I go to shows, but all I could find was a pen, so he signed the cover with that.   If you're into modern psychedelic music, improvisational jazz, or simply really impressive musicianship, check out Jonatan Gat's Director."

It had a bowl warp to it and for that reason it wouldn't register on my technics SL-5. Long story short, I placed it outside, on a warm sunny day,  between sheets of parchment paper and then two 14"" ceramic tiles that I picked up at Home Depot. Put a a few medium sized rocks on it and left it out there until about dinner at which point I brought it in to cool, still between the tiles. The next morning the warp was pretty much gone and the record plays fine. I tried the method of heating the tiles in the oven once before and it resulted in a record more elliptical than round that would no longer play... I think the oven just got the tiles too hot. Good luck if you choose to give it a try."

vinyl,3duv50,PorkStuff,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:50:46 2015 UTC,"Many people will tell you it's not possible but you can do it if you have the right equipment and you are careful. My home oven actually has a very low temperature dehydrate mode that circulates air while staying at 100° F. The melting point of vinyl is 100-130° F depending on composition. You just want to soften it just enough that the warp evens out. I have two 12x12"" mirrors from IKEA and a 10 lb weight that I put on top of them. I've un-warped several records by baking overnight. Yes, the argument that the grooves are ultimately changed microscopically is true but I'd rather have a playable record that maybe has a impercetible increase in wow and flutter or distortion or one that doesn't play at all. To my ear, I haven't been able to hear the difference.  In my experience, anything over 130° F and even the vinyl flat (felt Groovy Rings leaves a texture) cause too much damage."
vinyl,3duv50,TheFlyInYourEye,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:57:41 2015 UTC,"In all honestly, there isn't one. If it's not warped badly, and by that I mean the warping is only slight, then it should still be playable. Any more than that and your stuffed. People have of course tried to in warp, however each attempt hasn't fixed the underlying issue of the warping damaging the grooves, hence damaging the music. Because of this, there really isn't anyway to fix warping. Instead you'd be better off getting a refund, or just taking the hit and go out and buy a new one."

It would be great to unwarp them especially if it were cheap and relatively easy."
vinyl,3duv50,Loud_Vinyl_Disks,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:38:10 2015 UTC,If they said it is a bit warped play it and see how it is before worrying about it. Most records with slight warps play fine and the warp is not audible. Trying to fix it can cause more damage and render it unplayable.
vinyl,3dvqq5,PotatoesHaveSouls,4,Sun Jul 19 22:52:54 2015 UTC,"You have a very solid vintage setup; it would take most people a bit of effort to assemble something of that quality. The weakest link in your setup is easily the BIC Venturi Formula 5 speakers. They were never a critical listening or audiophile grade speaker. They are sort of a high-end party speaker (if there can be such a thing). If you are interested in replacing a component, I would start there.  You obviously need a new stylus for your cartridge. From the picture, it looks like you have an Audio Technica AT11/AT12/AT96 cartridge or similar. You can double-check by removing the stylus and seeing if there is a part number. If not, you can remove the cartridge form the headshell and check the top of it for the model number. Before you do: Take a pencil and precisely mark the position of the screws as they are now. The cartridge needs to be very accurately aligned in order to insure the best sound quality during playback and so that it does not damage your records. Assuming that it is currently aligned correctly, marking the screw position will allow you to put it back as it was.  When you find out the stylus or cartridge model, reply back and we can help you find a replacement stylus."
vinyl,3dvqq5,GothamCountySheriff,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:08:07 2015 UTC,The part about them being party speakers makes sense considering my dad said his brother was a DJ at parties with this whole setup. Thank you for the advice. I'll go do that now and get back to you with further information

Pretty basic but will get the job done: http://www.ebay.com/itm/AUDIO-TECHNICA-STYLUS-AT-VM3X-AT12E-ATXE-AT96E-AT88E/290475107110  JICO ATN-12XE high quality elliptical stylus: http://www.jico-stylus.com/product_info.php?products_id=99  JICO ATS-12S Shibata stylus. This is probably closest to the original stylus that was on there. It is a pretty high-end stylus. It will require that the cart be very accurately aligned specific to the replacement. http://www.jico-stylus.com/product_info.php?products_id=164  Of the three, the JICO ATN-12XE is probably the best compromise between budget and sound quality. I would suggest it or the Pfanstiehl for someone just getting into vinyl. I would wait on the shibata stylus until you are more comfortable handling vinyl and using your turntable. You would be less prone to make mistakes that could damage the records and will appreciate the sound more after upgrading.  After you get your replacement stylus, you will need to setup your tonearm. Here are a few videos on how to do that:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kc5u2jahbL4  https://youtu.be/YCv72S6K4MQ?t=2m28s  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jizk-3JGzag  A vintage receiver, especially one that has sat unused for some time, will usually get built-up that interferes with the controls and reduces sound quality. It can often be attributed to dirty pententiometers (aka as ""pots"") and switches. The receiver controls should be cleaned with a quality electronics cleaner and then followed with a lubricant.   Audiokarma.org cleaning guide for your receiver: http://www.audiokarma.org/forums/showthread.php?t=207005  I recommend Deoxit electronics cleaner followed by Deoxit fader lube. If you can't get that, then CRC QD Contact Cleaner (BLUE can NOT red can) and their lube work well. For reference:  http://www.amazon.com/Hosa-Cable-Deoxit-Contact-Cleaner/dp/B00006LVEU  http://www.amazon.com/Hosa-F5S-H6-CAIG-DeoxIT-Faderlube/dp/B00006LVF1  http://www.homedepot.com/p/CRC-QD-11-oz-Contact-Cleaner-02130-6/202262505  http://www.homedepot.com/p/CRC-2-26-5-oz-Multi-Purpose-Lubricant-02004/100398344  Oddly, for such a basic maintenance necessity, there aren't that many good cleaning videos, but this one for a guitar amp has good shots of where you need to get at the pots when cleaning them. You shouldn't need to use that much fluid when cleaning though.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QvOepREO4k"

In a way, they have to preserve the format as to not distort the music. As far as I know, some bands during these years still were not affected by the loudness war and preferred to master quietly even if it wasn't going on vinyl; it also helps wi the dynamic range and nuances that pumped up music usually lacks. It's not radio-friendly to master like this, but it gives it its charm through the quiet noise.  Or, at least, that's what I tell myself. I could be completely wrong."

vinyl,3duyd1,TheGiraffeRider,2,Sun Jul 19 18:52:47 2015 UTC,The Audio-Technica is a deal for $100. Jump on it. It should go really fast.

vinyl,3dvbyx,triplej23,3,Sun Jul 19 20:48:05 2015 UTC,There's no adjustable counterweight on a T4P mount turntable.  It's plug and play.
vinyl,3dvbyx,LaserRanger,2,Sun Jul 19 21:22:42 2015 UTC,"The SL-B200 is a T4P/pmount turntable. The specification for T4P is designed to eliminate (or reduce) the need for turntable setup that you would find on other turntables. Other than the pitch adjustment, the cue lift adjustment, and the lead-out for the auto-return, your turntable does not have any other user adjustable settings. Your turntable does not have an adjustable counterweight.  Can you explain what you did to adjust the height of the tonearm?"
vinyl,3dvbyx,GothamCountySheriff,2,Sun Jul 19 21:25:26 2015 UTC,"To adjust the height, I followed the manual and turned the adjustment screw, this does change the height. I believe the manual said the distance between the stylus tip and record should be 4-6mm, when the arm is in the up position."
vinyl,3dvbyx,GothamCountySheriff,3,Sun Jul 19 21:48:53 2015 UTC,"Are you referring to the  ""Arm-Lift Height Adjustment"" from page 5 of the manual?"
vinyl,3dvbyx,GothamCountySheriff,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:52:55 2015 UTC,Yes
vinyl,3dvbyx,GothamCountySheriff,2,Sun Jul 19 21:54:05 2015 UTC,That is for adjusting the height of the cue-lift. It doesn't change the height or the tracking angle of the tonearm during playback.
vinyl,3dvbyx,GothamCountySheriff,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:56:56 2015 UTC,I wonder if the slight warped sound is because there isn't enough or too much force being applied by the stylus
vinyl,3dvbyx,GothamCountySheriff,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:51:29 2015 UTC,"The T4P spec sets the tracking force at 1.25 grams with a compatible pmount stylus. Unless some other change has been made to the tonearm since it left the factory, tracking weight isn't the issue.  A warped or warbling sound during playback could indicate a speed consistency issue. When was the belt last replaced?"

vinyl,3dtw2j,employee6817,2,Sun Jul 19 18:20:34 2015 UTC,My cat thought she was a DJ haha.  She would watch the records spin for awhile then decided she should try her paw at it.  I'll never forget the look on her face when she first touched the records and stopped it from spinning and creating silence.  She was in total awe ha-ha.  Then she made a regular thing out of trying to manipulate the sound by touching it!

vinyl,3dr2lg,browncrackers,15,Sat Jul 18 17:12:41 2015 UTC,"I'm using a Technics SL-D3 and a Pioneer SX-636, both of which I got off ebay a few years ago.  Cartridge is a Shure m97mxe.  I recently added the LED light strip, which was a little more difficult to put on than I thought it would be, so I'm really happy with how it turned out!  Album spinning is Bonobo - Black Sands, a fantastic downtempo/trip-hop/mellow electronic/whatever you wanna call it album that I recommend you listen to if you haven't already.  All songs are great, but favorite is probably Kong  Other albums that are visible are Purity Ring - Shrines, Jon Hopkins - Immunity, Flying Lotus - Cosmogramma, and Teebs - Ardour.  I framed one of my favorite artist's albums to the left of my shelf, which is Shigeto - No Better Time Than Now.    Picture on the tv is the music video of Toro Y Moi - Rose Quartz  Really enjoying my setup right now, especially at night with the lights slowly fading from one color to the next while spinning :)  Any questions, just ask!"
vinyl,3dr2lg,TheLastGovernment,5,Sat Jul 18 17:12:47 2015 UTC,Awesome setup. You can never go wrong with an SL-D3.
vinyl,3dr2lg,Defrenzo,3,Sat Jul 18 17:19:32 2015 UTC,"What kind of speakers are you using? Nice setup, btw."
vinyl,3dr2lg,randye,2,Sat Jul 18 18:26:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks! So the speakers are Dayton B652's, which used to be highly recommended budget speakers, however someone pointed out that, a couple years ago, they had been severely downgraded by the company in many ways and so weren't recommended anymore. Now, they are apparently good again.  So yea lol, that's what I use."
vinyl,3dr2lg,chadwickerbasket,2,Sat Jul 18 18:58:07 2015 UTC,That was a short period in 2013 when they changed suppliers. The issue was resolved in that same year.
vinyl,3dr2lg,Rekoza,2,Sun Jul 19 04:02:33 2015 UTC,I have the same speakers.  What stands are you using?
vinyl,3dr2lg,jabberbox,2,Sun Jul 19 16:38:37 2015 UTC,"You should use the TV to get a visualiser going with whatever your spinning, you might need a dual output so the music also goes into the TV but that would be incredible"
vinyl,3dr2lg,Mind-Reflections,3,Sat Jul 18 18:35:12 2015 UTC,"I'm not very familiar with that, but that sounds amazing!  I will definitely look into that.  There is a sensor connected to the lights, so they can change colors to the sounds of the music, but getting the tv involved would be awesome!  Thanks for the suggestion."
vinyl,3dr2lg,Mind-Reflections,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:43:32 2015 UTC,What do you use to to change the colors of the LEDs with the music?
vinyl,3dr2lg,Susfour,3,Sun Jul 19 06:01:07 2015 UTC,"These are the LEDs I got.  It comes with a sound sense IR controller.  And also comes with a little remote control so you can make it a constant color, or have it transition from one color to the next, or have it change to the beat of the music.  Here is a video of it.  The LED lights come in one long strip.  Not sure if it's the most efficient way, but what I did was cut it into 8 separate strips, and then connected them with these, and then ran the extender wire along the upper corners of the shelves with mounting tape, so it was basically one long continuous strip."
vinyl,3dr2lg,atheist_apostate,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:16:17 2015 UTC,"Can you elaborate (maybe with pictures) how you cut and connected the LED's and extender wire's in the upper corners. I'd love to do this, but wish I had a guide (with pictures) I have a 9 cube display however."
vinyl,3dr2lg,atheist_apostate,2,Mon Jul 20 03:15:50 2015 UTC,"http://imgur.com/a/sgT0O       So I thought my instructions would show on Imgur, but I don't see them, so I'll type them out here.     Pic 1/7: The LED light strip I got (link is above) came on a reel in one long continuous piece     Pic 2/7: There are certain spots throughout the LED strip that are marked with a scissor icon.  These are the spots you can cut them to separate them into smaller pieces.  I cut 8 pieces (which is the number of shelves I have) that were each a little shorter than the length of each shelf.  In the back of the pic, you can see the extender wires (still in the bags; also one attached to the bottom of the strip I'm holding).  The copper things at the ends of each strip slip into the white plastic things at the ends of the connecter wires (can see this is pic too).     Pic 3/7: I used the connector wires (7 total) to connect the 8 LED strips I made, so that it was one long continuous piece     Pic 4/7: The LED strips have 3M adhesive so they can stick to wherever you put them.  I started on the upper right shelf.  So I stuck the first LED strip, then ran the extender wire along the upper left corner until I got to the back of the shelf, then wrapped it around and back towards the front so that it ended up in the upper right corner of the next shelf over.  The I stuck the 2nd LED strip.  And so on and so on.     Pic 5/7: The 1 meter extender wire is long enough when moving from one shelf to the next, but when going from the top shelf to bottom, I needed a longer one (I used 2 meter).  It was still longer than it needed to be, so I just ran it up and down along the back of the shelf (and I used mounting tape to make sure it stuck there) and then left just enough that it could reach the front, where I then started working on the bottom shelves.     Pic 6/7: Progress.  Started at top right, went to top left, then bottom left, and working over to bottom right.     Pic 7/7: Done :)     A couple things.  The LED strip that I got is for outdoor use, and so it was covered in a layer of silicone.  So if I wanted to connect a strip into the end of extender wire, I had to peel off that bit of silicon so that the copper things would be exposed.  I had to use a razor to cut into the silicone and then peel it off with my fingers.  It was pretty hard.  Would probably be easier to get an LED light strip without the silicone covering.     Also, the extender wires weren't great.  If I bent them too much, then the connection to the LED strip would mess up and some lights would stop turning on or would turn the wrong color.  So I had to be careful how I positioned the extender wires which was a major pain in the ass.  It may be better to use this and solder the pieces together yourself.       Hope this helps! :)"

The owner of the record store that was in my town was friends with The Avett Brothers and carried all their albums from the beginning. They played my little town before anyone knew who they were. I passed on all of the records as I wasnt a huge fan of them then. Ive been kicking myself for that since Ive started appreciating them a bit more.

vinyl,3dsk4a,HGFantomas,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:00:50 2015 UTC,Its a surprisingly good record. The label that put it out released a ton of roots music back in the 70s. Most of which are not hard to find at reasonable prices. I love old field recordings.
vinyl,3duja7,ModestMarinara,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:44:17 2015 UTC,Picking up a radio station is due to your cables. Cables are antennas. You need proper shielding and grounding of your cables for them to reject interference: the cheap thin cables that are most common in lower-end gear usually has this problem.  All of your stuff in one place will not result in picking up a radio station. It will result in interference which means again you should use good cables. Or if you have a ton of stuff in one place (as I do) you have to switch to balanced interconnects no question.
vinyl,3duja7,Josuah,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:58:54 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice.  Any recommendations on cables that don't suck?
vinyl,3duja7,Josuah,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:55:12 2015 UTC,"Reasonably priced cables from a reputable brand are a good place to start. I usually go with Blue Jeans Cable for starters, but also worth considering are pro audio cables from brands like Mogami or Canare (I don't recommend Hosa) or the original RCA brand.  This does assume your gear is properly grounded at the RCA jack.  I happen to use mostly Impact Acoustics 14awg speaker cable for short runs, doubled-up to 11awg for longer runs. But that's mostly because I got a 1000' spool of the stuff a while back."
vinyl,3duacx,ILikeMathsDebating,2,Sun Jul 19 15:20:39 2015 UTC,"I'd say your best option is definitely second hand. The cheapeast decent TT you will be able to get new is the Pro-Ject Elemental at £159, which doesn't leave a whole lot of money for the rest of the setup."
vinyl,3duacx,rpbtz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:59:39 2015 UTC,"is that TT any good? :) if so I was thinking speakers like this which would be slightly over my budget, but it would be fine :)"
vinyl,3duacx,GothamCountySheriff,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:02:21 2015 UTC,Just realised I'd need a pre amp too :/
vinyl,3duacx,GothamCountySheriff,3,Sun Jul 19 17:03:36 2015 UTC,"You need these four elements to get sound from a record:   Turntable Phono Stage (aka Phono Preamp) Amplifier Speakers   Some newer turntables come with the phono stage built-in. Most turntables do not and will need an separate phono stage. Some speakers come with the amplifier built-in (like the Behringer powered monitors you linked). Most speakers do not have a built-in amplifier and will need an separate one. Commonly, the separate amplifier will be in the form of a piece of equipment known as a receiver.  Here are some possible setups: * Turntable (w/ built-in Phono Stage) -> Powered Speakers * Turntable -> Phono Stage -> Powered Speakers * Turntable (w/ built-in Phono Stage) -> Receiver -> Speakers * Turntable -> Phono Stage -> Receiver -> Speakers"
vinyl,3duacx,GothamCountySheriff,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:23:29 2015 UTC,"So a set up example could be the project elemental, a preamp and the speakers I linked?"
vinyl,3duacx,rpbtz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:17:51 2015 UTC,"Yes. The Pro-Ject Elemental, a phono stage and the Behringer speakers would be all you need to have a working system.  Behringer makes the budget PP400 phono stage, which would work for your setup:  http://www.amazon.co.uk/Behringer-PP400-Microphono-Compact-Preamp/dp/B000H2BC4E  Another option would be to get the Pro-Ject Elemental Phono USB and the Behringer speakers you linked. The Elemental Phono USB has a built-in phono stage (as well as a USB connection for transferring music to computer). You wouldn't need the separate Behringer PP400 if you chose the Elemental Phono USB turntable.  http://www.amazon.co.uk/Project-Elemental-USB-Turntable-White/dp/B00FZ646ZO"
vinyl,3duacx,rpbtz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:35:23 2015 UTC,"So with them two options in mind, shall I go for the cheaper option? or are there pros and cons to each choice there? :)"
vinyl,3duacx,rpbtz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:59:27 2015 UTC,Getting a turntable with a built-in phono stage means less setup and less wires. Getting a separate phono stage will allow for upgrading in the future. It's down to personal preference.
vinyl,3duacx,rpbtz,2,Sun Jul 19 21:20:08 2015 UTC,"Yup. But if you buy powered speakers at least you won't have to get a receiver either.  As for the preamp, you can get a Behringer for £20. The Art DJPre II would be a pretty good upgrade from that, but it's also twice the price, so how much you'd spend on a preamp is up to you.  I don't know anything about those speakers though. Maybe you  can find some other decently priced powered speakers that's closer to your budget? Otherwise you could try to look for second hand speakers."
vinyl,3duacx,billfred,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:17:55 2015 UTC,"Ok so I'm thinking the pro ject elemental usb with the speakers I linked above, would all the cables be included?"
vinyl,3duacx,Kactus_Karma,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:56:11 2015 UTC,"Good question. I would assume that the TT comes with the necessary cables for it to function, but don't know about the speakers. I'd try writing the seller just in case.  I didn't actually know that there was a USB version of the Elemental. That seems to be a good choice as it's got a built in preamp and afaik Pro-Jects preamps are quite nice."

vinyl,3dr605,Tastygroove,5,Sat Jul 18 22:38:13 2015 UTC,"Back around the beginning of December I was offered a new job (my dream job) in Texas, but the condition was I had to start within two weeks of the background checks and all the pre-hire paperwork being complete.  At the time the job was offered, I was told that would take about 8 weeks.  Two weeks later I was told that the paperwork had been pushed through (they'd been looking for someone for about six months and were desperate to get the role filled) and I was asked if I could be there to start on December 29th.  Needless to say, my wife and I sold, gave away to friends and family or donated damn near everything, including our turntables and speakers.  The remaining important stuff like books, our record collection, tools and unreplaceable stuff went into a storage shed in Arizona to await our return.  We left Phoenix on Christmas day 2014 with two angry and doped up cats and whatever clothes and miscellaneous things we could box and fit in the bed of my truck.  Since then we've been replacing all the stuff that was sacrificed to the gods of moving.  First piece of furniture that we got was a six foot cat tree, then an Ikea mattress, then a couch and then a bed and so on and so forth.  When the Insound sale popped up, I went to grab a Pro-ject Speed Box, because I figured it was nice to get one while it was cheap.  The order went through, but I got a cancellation the next day.  I laughed that off and thought ""Well, they're probably selling out and cancelling like crazy, I'll see if I can grab a turntable and preamp and it'll probably get cancelled too"".  So I grabbed the Pro-Ject Phono Box and the Pro-Ject Debut Carbon Dinosaur Jr edition turntable.  Of course, the expensive stuff didn't get cancelled.  ಠ_ಠ  I picked up some Audioengine A5+ speakers in white to go with the purple of the Dino Jr player and got those in last night.  I've thrown everything together with some Tech N9ne while we move furniture around to better accomodate having music on vinyl back in the house.  Now we just have to plan a trip back to Arizona to get the rest of the records."

It's also not that crazy to suspect that this could be another limited release like the first. If that's true then it's likely that it is a picture disc or is pressed to colored vinyl.

If youre spend that much money on the turntable you might just want to make the push for a project debut carbon. Imo acrylic money can be better put into your reciever or preamp or speakers.

vinyl,3dppva,Loud_Vinyl_Disks,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:26:17 2015 UTC,I absolutely LOVE the idea of using a dresser for your setup. Beautifully done. I might have to steal that idea.
vinyl,3dppva,Loud_Vinyl_Disks,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:01:02 2015 UTC,After viewing your picture I thought I'd give you a heads up. It's difficult to tell how much space is between the top of your receiver and the top of the draw space it is inserted into. If you have ventilation holes on top of the receiver it is important not to obstruct them or the receiver may overheat.
vinyl,3dppva,Freakk5,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:26:04 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, the receiver itself fits snug in the actual opening but there is plenty of space inside the dresser for air circulation.  There is also a huge gap to the left of the receiver that air can move through, in addition to the hole I cut in the back of the dresser."

vinyl,3dtg0l,rpbtz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:36:49 2015 UTC,"Honestly, probably.  I'm not sure what you mean by 'stylish.' Bang & Olufsen tables are beautiful but in my eyes are not worth the trouble because of how expensive they are to keep up and to refurbish.  I personally enjoy the look of Thorens Tables, but yet again those are very expensive.  I love the look of my U-Turn Orbit, it's very minimalistic and I've been called a dirty hipster every now and then so I think I'm doing alright on that front.    The easiest thing I'd say that is literally when U-Turn starts rolling out the built-in preamp version of the Orbit and getting her a set of powered speakers, but that's way beyond $150, and you don't even know when it's going to be released."
vinyl,3dtg0l,gtfokenny,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:53:29 2015 UTC,Craiglist and a little bit of research and knowlege will get you pretty far with vintage audio.   If you post your local craigslist area we can always try and find recommendations?

vinyl,3dtg0l,Loud_Vinyl_Disks,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:42:37 2015 UTC,It pays to be patient when shopping craigslist. Look often and when you see a good deal pounce and pick it up ASAP before it's gone.  I found this this today that is a steal for $80 with a receiver. This deck was $300 new back in the early 80s  ($868 in 2015 dollars). If anyone is looking for a good TT in Western MA this will do just fine. http://westernmass.craigslist.org/ele/5085097670.html

vinyl,3dtg0l,Loud_Vinyl_Disks,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:35:19 2015 UTC,I agree with shopping the thrifts too. I'd just like to add a bit of advice. If you grab a receiver or other component plug it in and make sure it powers up before paying and walking out the door. I learned the hard way. I bought a Yahama receiver at Goodwill that was totally dead when i got it home and plugged it in. The store was 100 miles away and here was no way I'd be able to take it back within the couple of days they allowed to return it.

vinyl,3dryb9,A_Goofy_Movie,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:16:09 2015 UTC,You could get a LOT more out of your setup by going vintage.   Looking for a ~$100 vintage technics/thorens/marantz/pioneer turntable on ebay/craigslist/local record shop/goodwill will give you as good (if not better) sound than the AT and free up another $150 for a phono preamp superior to the built in preamp in the lp120 and leave some money for better speakers.  Welcome to the community!
vinyl,3dsvfl,svx2120,2,Sun Jul 19 03:19:53 2015 UTC,"Well, it's a synchronous motor, so no speed adjustments.  You could try lubing the spindle.  You could also try the trick of putting nail polish on the motor spindle (capstan).  That increases the ratio of motor to platter and makes it run faster.  Or try a bit of scotch tape around the capstan, but I think that might make it too fast.  Maybe google for audiokarma threads related to this model.  FWIW, no adjustments does not necessarily mean it's lower end (although it does in later models).  Adjusters required a FG servo or quartz control, which didn't come cheaply until a bit later."
vinyl,3dsvfl,LaserRanger,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:10:48 2015 UTC,"I need to figure out how to get the top of the spindle off to lube it, but I'll give it a try.

They played a basement show in Seattle (I think) with a couple of other bands -- including Modest Mouse.  Thing is, by that time I was kind of tired of seeing 4-5 bands every night, and the house had a trampoline in the back yard.  So, I chose bouncing on the trampoline over watching the other bands, thereby foregoing my chance to see Modest Mouse in someone's basement.  Not one of my smartest decisions."

vinyl,3dqr8t,competitionroolz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:27:20 2015 UTC,"I picked this up at random at Goodwill last weekend, on the “what the hell” theory, and was pleasantly surprised with it. It is a single by Bobby Sax and the New Messiah – “Out-House ’73,” parts 1 and 2. I’m having trouble finding much info about it online, but it apparently is a 1973 release (judging from the label) by a DC (or Baltimore?) based funk/soul group, led by, I guess, Bobby Sax. Super catchy upbeat stuff, very dancy, mostly instrumental (with the occasional “Outhouse!” shout). Someone put it on YouTube, so you can listen to it here. Googling about makes it look like it’s at least moderately collectible, but like I said, I can’t figure out who this guy is! I assume a local guy (or group) that never quite broke through, but had some kind of local following. Anyway, neat stuff and well work the 50 cents.    Also got a James Brown 7” on King. Not particularly rare, but man does that label look cool. Good song, too."

Aside from having Brian Setzer perform an exorcism on your house and stereo equipment there's probably not much that can be done about it. It's certainly an electronic issue and unless those sections of the disc are somehow magically conductive, there's no way it's the record's fault. It's strange but since it only happens on this one record I wouldn't worry too much about it. When it starts becoming a pervasive issue on other records - then that's a very legitimate issue and something you definitely want to get sorted out, not only for your safety but the safety of your records as well. Faulty gear can be a risk."

There are no panning issues with true stereo recordings, what you're thinking of is usually referred to as false stereo recording. In the early '60s, before most people had stereos, they listened to mono phonographs or AM radio. By the late '60s, most people had stereo players. The record companies still released records in mono to accommodate AM radio, and those few who still had mono players.  (edit:sp"
vinyl,3dsfx7,Artbrutist,3,Sun Jul 19 03:07:16 2015 UTC,"Once you're in the 70's there isn't any choice, mono was done as a consumer music format by that point (in the U.S. at least)   To be honest with you it's very much a case by case basis. There are great multitracked stereo recordings going back to the 50's. For the most part, pop/rock will sound better in mono. But you'll probably want to do some preliminary research album by album. I think you'll have an easier time compiling albums from that era that are particularly worth getting in stereo.   For what it's worth, I think some of the early Beach Boys stuff slays in stereo - at least what they did manage to mix that way.   Another nice one - The Zombies, Oddesey & Oracle. Recorded on A j37 at abbey road but the mix is better than anything the Beatles did in that era. And the stereo mix was very much an afterthought (the band went and remixed the entire record at their own cost because the label wouldn't accept a mono master on its own)  but well done nonetheless. Stereo vinyl is superb.  There was an all-analog reissue available for a long while on Big Beat records but now it's been pushed off the market by a couple of digitally sourced reissues, sadly."

The powered speakers- I overpaid for these by about $50 compared to what I can find online, but regardless, they're horrible.

vinyl,3dsehv,PlaylisterBot,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:25:08 2015 UTC,"At first there was very little showcasing of the product, which made me hesitant to be an early adopter.  With the two new videos there is something very clear: this is not just a gimmick, but if you are expecting a $450 turntable sound out of this product, I feel like you will be disappointed.  The ""vertical"" part of the table isn't truly up and down, which allows the stylus to still use gravity to track correctly, but with a very shallow 75 to 80 degree angle. That bluetooth gramophone is so gimmicky it hurts.  I have no doubt that it sounds better than $100 bluetooth bricks, but something about it and it's price sets my BS alarms off.  It's not a product for me, and it's definitely far more valuable as a novelty, which is something that the vertical turntable offers.  For my SACD/DVD/Bluray setup, I have a Kenwood GE-76 between my Technics SH-AC500D and my front monitors.  It doesn't do anything, but for $25 off of craigslist, I get a pretty slick spectrum analyzer for the rig, and that's a great talking point when I show off the system to friends who aren't audiophiles.  That incentive was enough for me to purchase it, which brings me to my next point. Yes, but later.  I can't be an early adopter with a company this small and young.  It has great ideas, and I think this is a novel idea, but I'm happy with my current turntable.  It certainly won't be a turntable people purchase to replace their current one, but it will be an option for those looking to get a centerpiece for their living room setup.

Get better quality stuff, like audiophile pressings and such. Or get a spin clean. If you are feeling like your set up is lacking some low end, a sub would probably help. If I was in your position, I'd take a portion of what you have saved up and use it to buy a special record, something that you've wanted for a while. Then I'd take the rest and save it for a major upgrade down the road. Like a Linn/Clearaudio turntable or some very nice speakers. I feel like I wouldn't want to get a slight upgrade when if you were patient were able to get something that will last a lot longer. Or you could spend some money on room treatment. That will ensure that you will get the most of the current gear that you have.   I had the BS22 bookshelves and when I upgraded to the Monitor Audio BX2 speakers there was only a slight sound difference despite being  a hundreds  of dollars more."

vinyl,3dp2ie,the_retroist,3,Sat Jul 18 02:20:39 2015 UTC,"Bad brains - Self titled If you're into loud old school punk rock, this albums for you. It's fun, it's energetic and it's sure to make your neighbors hate you. With some big punk hits (and a few reggae ones) this album sent me looking for more of these guys, more of punk and turned me into who I am today, as a musician.  Antiseen - One Live Son of a bitch Disgusting, vile and down right putrid is how I'd describe Antiseen. Controversial as they are, Antiseen packs a punch with this live album. Personally, I love the bad guy allure of these guys. With a love for pro-wrestling, blood, and a total disregard for anyone or anything, these guys are what define punk for me. If it weren't for these assholes, I'd still be giving a fuck about being cool with the fucks who wear those stupid tattoos and color their hair.  Syd Barret - Mad Cap Laughs Honestly, this album blew me away. You're not going to convince me there was anything wrong with Syd and if I didn't know any better I'd say there wasn't. He seems like some great mind sitting down with his guitar, playing some kickass psychedelic tunes. One of my favorite albums to get stoned to.   Pharmakon - Abandon A noisy, violent, almost painful to listen to album and that's exactly what I love about it. Pharmakon puts on a great effort, she honestly delivers a powerful performance with this one. This is Merbow or Massona or any of those other noise guys you've heard, this has a bit of a pulse. She's almost tortured, from what I can tell and it makes you sad. Great to listen to in the dark, great to see live.  Boards of Canada - Tomorrow's Harvest Honestly, I just love this one.   Trash Talk - 119 Another punk band, and these guys are fucking brutal. I feel like these guys are part of youth rebellion that I've noticed in new punk, filled with apathy, violence, drugs and alcohol.   Half-Japanese - Overjoyed  Artsy side of punk, all I can say is Jab Fair is great.  Willie Nelson - Always on my mind I can't leave out Willie.   *edit - formatting"
vinyl,3dp2ie,redplasticgoat,2,Sat Jul 18 02:23:43 2015 UTC,Some cool records. I love that Syd Barrett record too. And that Pharmakon record. Shit. All the noise I've listened to and somehow that one feels the most visceral. Brutal gets tossed around a lot but that one honestly is.

Total price was 3.30 euro (0.25/single and 1.30 for the 12""). Might not be the best haul but my collection is still very small so I'll take what I can get. I'm a big Dean Martin fan so I'm very happy with the compilation album. Take On Me and My Baker were also on my wishlist for a while and they sound great so I'm really stoked!  I didn't know I had to increase the turntable speed for the singles and I found Billy Joel in slow motion way funnier than I'd like to admit."

vinyl,3dp1z1,diablodow,2,Sat Jul 18 02:15:26 2015 UTC,"Nice looking deck. As for the choice of media Johnny Cash is the Man!  You need to get yourself something to clean the disks with before playing them. It can remove some of the noise and pops. I never play a used album till it's been on my RCM (Record Cleaning Machine) I use VPI HW-16.5s. There are non mechanical alternatives    As for the skips, watch the record and take note of the location on the label where the skip occurs, the track, and the distance in from the blank vinyl between the songs. Examine the area closely. Many times skips are caused by something adhered to the record which can be gently removed with  your fingernail. If there is a scratch that goes kind of parallel to the groove there is not much you can do to fix it. Most of the time scratches that go perpendicular to the grooves are no problem and quite often cannot be heard.  If you are having problems with skipping on a new deck it may not be the record that is the problem. Make sure the plinth is level with a bubble or T level. Check your stylus force. The best tool is an inexpensive gram scale. If equipped, an improper Anti-skate setting causes skips. Vibrations in the floor causes skips as does vibrations from the speakers."
vinyl,3dp1z1,Loud_Vinyl_Disks,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:02:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the help!! I bought a nice cleaning kit, but I got a bit too excited to see if it played to wait. I'll try it with some new vinyl tomorrow and see if the skips are on the record (it is 70 years old after all) or if I need to tinker. I have it on a solid wood desk and the level looked OK. I'll post an update tomorrow with everything setup in my office."
vinyl,3dp1z1,Loud_Vinyl_Disks,2,Sat Jul 18 05:23:50 2015 UTC,You can't go by looks. When I moved my Thorens one corner was off by close to a half an inch on a custom made oak rack in a fairly new house. Levels are cheap. Any small one will do. The ones I quoted up top are to leave on the deck all the time but you can use any small inexpensive level as well.
vinyl,3dp1z1,Loud_Vinyl_Disks,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:09:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice, I just got everything playing right. I had to tweak the balance on the swing arm with the counterweight but now no skips. Also ran an RVA brush with cleaner over it and haven't heard any bad popping."
vinyl,3dptfc,lucksas,4,Sat Jul 18 07:20:02 2015 UTC,"Do not leave them in the car in the sun when you are not moving.

vinyl,3dptfc,Loud_Vinyl_Disks,2,Sat Jul 18 07:28:48 2015 UTC,"Hopefully you have working AC in your car. You can also cover the boxes with a heavy blanket to protect them from direct sunlight. If you have to leave your car parked for a while, look for a shady spot and crack the windows to help vent out hot air.  Or just wait until January."
vinyl,3dptfc,mydogisangry,-1,Sat Jul 18 18:07:57 2015 UTC,"Here's what you don't want - uneven pressure. The heat will deform the record very easily. So here's what you want to do. If you've got room in the trunk, what you want to do is put your record down completely flat, and preferably with nothing else on top of it.   I tested this out. I left a 70's punk LP in my car, not in a garage or anything, and not in any kind of shade - I wanna say a bit over a year. Not intentionally at first and then it turned into some kind of experiment. It was completely fine after, probably not the best but definitely makes me not as worried as I used to be about buying records on a hot day. They'll survive the drive if you're careful."
vinyl,3dnc44,isthishandletaken,6,Fri Jul 17 17:49:01 2015 UTC,Wilco rules! They gave the album away for free to their fans. I'm listening to it right now and I am definitely buying the vinyl

vinyl,3dpg40,GothamCountySheriff,2,Sat Jul 18 04:57:48 2015 UTC,It is poor tonearm design. The problem manifests most obviously on thicker records (180 gram) and usually most prevalent at the beginning and end of the record.
vinyl,3dpg40,GothamCountySheriff,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:27:54 2015 UTC,"yeah it's only skipping for the first song and a half or so on each side and then it's fine, must be the table. It's kind of disappointing but thank you for your help!"
vinyl,3dpg40,GothamCountySheriff,2,Sat Jul 18 07:14:01 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry it worked out that way. If you want to link to your craigslist, I can look through and see if there's something worthwhile. T4P/pmount turntables (especially Technics) are usually fairly inexpensive, easy to use, don't have design issues, and are gentle to records. There might be one available locally. You could then sell your LP60 to recoup some of the difference."

Trust me, you'll have no trouble whatsoever driving those. Will you be able to bump music for a block party, eh, probably not but you will definitely be able to make things uncomfortably loud for you and a few houses over if you felt like it.   That said, I'm not so sure it would be an upgrade for you. It may be more of a side-grade. I don't think there would be a huge difference in sound between the two, but if you do have the opportunity to compare the two I think that would be good. Also keep in mind a 40+ year old piece of gear likely needs some work, and if it doesn't it will eventually. I do love my HK though."

The new album is really great. It is well thought out, produced perfectly, and extremely catchy. Definitely try to give it a listen without comparing it to his other releases. It is a different record, from a different period of his life. I think as long as you keep that in mind and aren't looking for him to reinvent what he has already made you'll be very happy with it! Just my two cents."

vinyl,3djwq9,sahboe,2,Thu Jul 16 22:10:10 2015 UTC,"That set was amazing. I was so exhausted and muddy and could barely stand, but the joy of hearing them play live for the first time kept me going. I immediately stumbled back to the campground and collapsed in my tent, but I couldn't sleep because I kept running the performance over in my head. Definitely a highlight of the festival and worth the 6 days of driving. I'm so excited to get the album in the mail tomorrow!"

We couldn't go in the festival until 2pm , and by 9 am  It was like an oven in the tents from the sun, but very little trees so we just sat around roasting. All there was for sale were half melted bags of ice, 24 packs of water, and 45 dollar cases of slightly chilled dos equis. Still, it could have been much worse. Oh, and Wayne never came to party like he promised Sunday night."

Really looking forward to this. I've been able to snag the limited Australian versions of both their previous albums, so I had to have this one as well. From what I've heard so far I won't be disappointed either :)"
vinyl,3djwq9,Harukiller14,2,Thu Jul 16 22:52:18 2015 UTC,Same here. I'm pretty excited because I bought it as soon as preorders went up and I think those copies might be signed because of the picture Parker posted on instagram to make up for the fact that they had released the preorders only in Australia or something

It's better thought of as a psych/R&B album rather than garage/psych like previous albums. It also may be my favorite album of theirs."

vinyl,3djwq9,bearodactylrak,-2,Fri Jul 17 05:25:09 2015 UTC,"And I am one of those people that could care less for what your saying. I dig the way some artists have cool word play or use other devices like alliteration. Its all about how it sounds man!  Edit: that sounded a bit harsh. I do think lyrics can be very meaningful but I think the emphasis should be on how the song sounds and how all the instruments, including vocals, work together. To me that's what sounds good."
vinyl,3djwq9,lamamafia,3,Fri Jul 17 02:07:49 2015 UTC,"For me, I listen to music for the music.  When an artist happens to write really meaningful lyrics that kick your heart in the ass, that's an extra-special bonus, and I definitely appreciate it.  But it's not necessary.  I don't think I've ever recommended an album to someone based on the lyrics.  Hell, I think Death Grips' ""Have a Sad Cum"" is one of my favourite songs of 2015."
vinyl,3djwq9,Harukiller14,-7,Fri Jul 17 05:28:35 2015 UTC,"You've never recommended an album for the lyrics because you don't listen to them as you just admitted. If you truly believe lyrics don't add anything then either you're listening to the most watered down pop music or you're just plain ignorant; Lyrics can be more than just about romance, they can be surrealist, political, philosophical, etc. Listening to the lyrics and connecting them the 'feel' the music gives you will show you a dynamic that you can't get from just listening to the instrumentals or reading the lyrics on their own. To give you an example, listen to the song Every Breath You Take by The Police; If you simply listen for the 'feel' of the  music you'd interpret it to be a love song however if you actually listen to the lyrics it's apparent the song is about a stalker watching the subject of his obsession. In regards to instrumentals, I wasn't talking about them was I? Obviously It goes without saying that if you are listening to a purely instrumental or ambient track then this sort of thing doesn't apply but if there are lyrics then by ignoring them you are missing out on half of the song."
vinyl,3djwq9,ryanirven,2,Fri Jul 17 06:03:23 2015 UTC,"You'll notice how I very deliberately said ""not necessarily"" or ""for some people.""  And yes, that was my point; I don't listen to music for the lyrics, so I've never recommended an album to someone based on lyrics.  I appreciate good lyricism, and can understand how that would be a major draw for some music fans.  But to suggest that by not paying close attention to lyrics, you're doing it wrong, is flat-out ignorant.  Yeah, I've got a couple of artist who's lyrics really draw me in.  I Am The Walrus is still one of the greatest songs ever recorded.  Edit   If you truly believe lyrics don't add anything   I definitely went so far as to say lyrics do add something.  I don't think you understand the angle I'm taking."

vinyl,3djwq9,PlaydoughMonster,3,Fri Jul 17 23:22:54 2015 UTC,"this attitude is why i can't read pitchfork reviews.  unless it's just vocals and one instrument, it's not half the experience."
vinyl,3djwq9,thewolfshead,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:33:08 2015 UTC,"The pitchfork review of this album was a tad gushing IMO. I mean, they drop KID A into their write-up...    It's a despairing, open-ended psych-disco hybrid whose closest modern analog is Daft Punk's Random Access Memories—a record that cast disco, yacht rock, and dance pop as shared founts of old-school, hands-on music-making. In this sense, the album reimagines and expands Tame Impala's relationship to album rock—like Loveless or Kid A or Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, it's the result of a supernaturally talented obsessive trying to perfect music while redefining their relationship to album-oriented rock. There's more care and nuance put into the drum filtering on ""Let It Happen"" than most bands manage in an entire career of recording.    Really? It's a good record, but beyond the epic opening track (which is great and clearly the best song on the album), I felt like it was a tad monotonous. The beats and basslines are good, but it kind of feels like the same idea most of the time. The Daft Punk and Radiohead they mention - while not direct correlations - are far more dynamic and allow for more variation.    While I like the new Tame Impala record, and have been listening to it a lot the last few days, sometimes it feels less innovative and more like another in the line of 1980s revivalist works that have been becoming more common."
vinyl,3djwq9,blerg34,3,Mon Jul 20 05:41:35 2015 UTC,"Thank you for being so brave. I will stand with you. I'm not really into it either. It sounds too pad heavy and too much P.M. Dawn/Evelyn ""Champagne"" King. I really like ""Let it Happen"" but after that it's downhill. I was also severely disappointed with Daft Punk's ""R.A.M."", so I'm sure this album will be a massive hit and a staple in this sub."

vinyl,3djwq9,NurseDuckett,3,Fri Jul 17 18:19:33 2015 UTC,"I find this happens at almost any show where a band plays new material after becoming popular off their old stuff.  There's exceptions (and it's much more pronounced in older acts) but generally I find that sets in during new songs people don't know - and maybe just because they've never heard them so aren't familiar with how to react (for example, if you know the melody of a song and you're dancing along to it)."

vinyl,3djwq9,SylvesterLundgren,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:56:13 2015 UTC,"I was simply going by my own personal experience. And in my experience, most of my colored vinyls sound markedly less clear (more noise, more static, etc) than 180g black vinyl. I have jamie xx colored vinyl deluxe edition (45 rpm), and also the black 33 rpm normal version. The normal 33rpm version sounds better than the colored counterpart, way less noise, hisses and pops. I have funkadelic maggot brain on orange vinyl, and its got a lot of hisses and pops in it. I have the tool picture disc vinyl, again sounds like ass. Those are just a few examples, maybe I have just been unlucky in the colored vinyls I have owned, but in my experience, it has been absolutely true, and thats what I was going by.  Small sample size, but thats where I was coming from."
vinyl,3djwq9,fozzles,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:15:28 2015 UTC,The Jamie XX colored one has received lots of criticism for being a poor pressing. Nothing to do with the color - all to do with pressing.  Also picture discs and colored vinyl shouldn't be compared like this. Picture discs are infamous for having poor sound quality and lots of surface noise. So generally don't buy picture discs if you're after good sound quality.  From your examples it seems like you've been unlucky with your pressings more than anything else.

vinyl,3dog2s,bitofleaf,3,Fri Jul 17 22:57:57 2015 UTC,It's definitely a grounding issue.  Connecting it to the radiator is actually grounding it properly.  I'm not sure what is the best way to fix it.
vinyl,3dog2s,isnt_it_weird,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:45:27 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a ground loop. I believe it becomes an issue when devices offering grounding but are not actually grounded. The radiator is probably your best solution. Otherwise, trying to ground to the amp may help, instead of grounding to the preamp."
vinyl,3doxjd,ianbro2001,2,Sat Jul 18 01:35:41 2015 UTC,It is if you like the band enough to spend that much. It's pretty average in today's market. $20 for the shirt and $20 for the record is not uncalled for.

vinyl,3dpg89,GothamCountySheriff,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:48:16 2015 UTC,I saw on ebay a fee months back that someone made a custom all in one turntable.

vinyl,3dpg89,GothamCountySheriff,2,Sat Jul 18 14:41:14 2015 UTC,"In order to use your setup with your soundbar you will need two things: a turntable and a phono stage (aka phono preamp).   The phono stage converts the phono-level signal to a line-level signal (like that output by a CD, MP3 player, DVD, etc.). The turntable will connect to the phono stage which will connect to your soundbar (Turntable > Phono-Stage > Soundbar). Some current production turntables have a phono stage (preamp) built-in. For those that don't, you will need and external one.   Here are a list of decent quality turntables that are around or below the $300 mark:   U-turn Orbit Basic Pro-Ject Elemental Audio Technica LP120 (w/ built-in phono stage) Pro-Ject Elemental Phono USB (w/ built-in phono stage) Pioneer PL-30-K (w/ built-in phono stage) Denon DP-300f (w/ built-in phono stage)   For those that don't have the built-in phono stage, two budget phono stages are:   Behringer PP400 Art DJ Pre II   Hopefully this gets you pointed in the right direction. Let us know if you have any more questions."

vinyl,3dndcm,terenn,2,Fri Jul 17 17:58:36 2015 UTC,"The main reason you are getting hum from that TT is because the platform it's sitting on is very light and resonant.

vinyl,3dp9gn,beckelle,2,Sat Jul 18 03:28:21 2015 UTC,"Number Two: Vinyl records sound better   His other four points were good, but saying this outright is asinine. Vinyl doesn't sound better, it sounds different and that difference can be a preference from person to person.  He makes very valid, strong arguments otherwise."
vinyl,3dp9gn,notagagaccount,-1,Sat Jul 18 03:37:23 2015 UTC,"Actually I strongly disagree. Many CDs, Mp3s, flacks, are brickwalled. This means when the recording is mastered the volume is pumped up to extreme levels to make them sound as loud as possible. The musicians intended amplitude of the recording is lost. You cannot hear all of the low nuances of the recording when everything else at higher levels is overpowering the details. A mastering done exclusively for vinyl is very different than one done for a digital file and will therefore sound very different. Watch what you buy in new releases as many records are cut from the same masters as the digital files. With recordings mastered like this there is no advantage to purchasing an analog record over a digital file.  More info at this link http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/threads/so-is-this-what-is-meant-by-brickwalled.294311/"
vinyl,3dp9gn,Loud_Vinyl_Disks,2,Sat Jul 18 08:07:44 2015 UTC,"Poor mastering isn't a result of the limitations of the digital format, but rather the limitations of radio delivery.  In my opinion, the SACD Multichannel release of Best of The Doors blows the 1973 quadraphonic record release of the same album.  But play either over stereo FM in your car and the louder one will ""sound better"" to most people.  Brickwalling music that lead to the loudness wars was the result of several different tracks by various artists mastered by different groups competing for air time. It was coincidence it coincided with the advent of the compact disk.  Vinyl, as we all know, is very special to a lot of us.  But the format itself sonically speaking will always struggle against the potential digital mediums offer.    Edit: I realize the comparison between Multi-channel SACD and Quadraphonic Vinyl is a REALLY unfair comparison, since for SACD, there is no digital brickwalling and was designed for multichannel playback, and the quadraphonic record is the result of mad scientists stretching the limitations of the medium to it's limits, but I digress."
vinyl,3dp9gn,notagagaccount,2,Sat Jul 18 09:14:47 2015 UTC,"Another thing to note is that while it's true that CDs don't have any content above 20 kHz or below 20 Hz, it's not like vinyl does away with those limitations. The vast majority or Carts roll off by 18 Hz and the one that extend to ~40 kHz are used to detect the carrier frequency for Quadraphonic records, not for actually playing a 40 kHz tone."

vinyl,3dp5ga,KDRX2,3,Sat Jul 18 02:49:12 2015 UTC,A receiver is an amplifier with a radio.  That's all it is.
vinyl,3dp5ga,LaserRanger,2,Sat Jul 18 03:05:33 2015 UTC,"I'ma get shredded for this.  Disclaimer: Everyone is going to say ditch the new TT and buy vintage everything.  If you do some hunting and resto work it'll be cheaper for better equipment and you can prob get a full setup for $500.  That said, if you're like me when I was new, and don't want to fuss with used equipment that needed cleaning/repair and want to just get up and running ASAP with guaranteed-to-work equipment:  Get the TT you want ($300-400) and spend the rest on some kind of computer speaker+sub setup which acts as a receiver/amp and speaker/sub setup for under a hundred bones.  It's definitely not ideal, but when I got started I had my LP60 feeding into one of these. (Don't cheap out on the TT like me tho.)  It's versatile and will also allow you to plug your phone in via the headphone jack.  They sound fine for starting out -- you're not going to be a golden-eared audiophile from day one, and it's just a $100 investment anyway.  Eventually, when you have a budget for a real setup and you have some experience under your belt with vinyl, you can upgrade with a nice vintage (or otherwise) receiver+speaker combo.  You'll already have a solid TT so you'll be set there.  You'll probably need a preamp: the uTurn Pluto is a good start, and is on sale with promo code (pluto15 I think?) for $75 right now.  These 3 items should come in just at or $100 over your budget depending on which TT you pick.  Bam."

vinyl,3dnm81,isthishandletaken,5,Fri Jul 17 19:11:34 2015 UTC,It means it's going to sound no better than a CD and probably worse.
vinyl,3dnm81,Khemikooligan,2,Fri Jul 17 19:30:41 2015 UTC,"When a record is released for the first time on vinyl the source they use for the audio is usually the master tapes, or the tapes that the music was originally recorded to in the studio. The music will also be mixed and mastered by the studio, which is to say that they will adjust the EQ, the bass, treble and mids, so that it is better suited for the vinyl format and so it sounds better.   When you have a bootleg it's basically someone unaffiliated with the record label illegally pressing copies of the album, furthermore, since they are seperate from the label they do not have access to the master tapes so they will usually use a CD as the source of the audio files which are used to press the records. Since they use CD's which have already been mastered, or EQ'd, for digital playback instead of analog playback the sound quality will usually sound worse than an official copy sourced from the master tapes."

That said, if there's a case where the mastering in particular on the available digital release is not very good, or the digital release is not available in as high a quality, then I'll go for the vinyl. Lots of stuff now is only getting 16/44 releases so the vinyl should provide a higher resolution experience. Heck, my last purchase wasn't even made available in lossless at all, only as MP3 and iTunes downloads. And that's not the only one. So vinyl definitely makes sense in that situation.  If it's something I reaallllyyy like I'll probably still get the vinyl anyway, just because. But that's very rare, and for the most part, I prefer to keep things pure.

vinyl,3dp11f,Cosmic_seas,2,Sat Jul 18 03:12:01 2015 UTC,Im pretty liberal when it comes to buying used vinyl for the reasons mentioned above as well as to explore different artists from labels that I like. As for new records I'm a little more picky (due to the cost) so I'll buy albums I thoroughly enjoy and do my exploring through spotify. Due to the streaming culture I sometimes forget about artists I really enjoy since I go through many phases when it comes to listening to music. Having the physical copy of an album I thoroughly enjoy allows me to reflect back on it freely when I may have otherwise forgotten it. I have so many moments when I'm thinking of a song and I'm like fuck I completely forgot about that album.
vinyl,3dp11f,isnt_it_weird,2,Sat Jul 18 03:16:25 2015 UTC,"The only real rule I have is when I go to a concert, I always buy some vinyl from the band I'm going to see.

I also buy certain albums to complete a discography for an artist, even if the albums get hardly any play.  I don't understand people who don't listen to digitally recorded music on vinyl, there's no reason to exclude it. Literally the best record I've ever heard was recorded and mastered digitally. Back in the 70s, every record which was recorded/mastered digitally proudly showed that it was done so. But now so many people have these ridiculous theories that digital is just terrible."

vinyl,3dp11f,sohcea,2,Sat Jul 18 05:40:53 2015 UTC,"I try not to buy anything digitally recorded on vinyl either.  The exceptions are if I find the album for dirt cheap, or if the album is from a band I really want to support.

These super limited releases hurt fans who want them and the labels who put them out (because they could have made a lot more money if they'd made more). They only help the flippers (this is selling for $200+ on ebay). A full 10%+ of these are on ebay. Even if they'd made 2000, they'd have sold them all very quickly. More money for the label, more happy fans, a diluted flipper market.  They already had a plan in place for a wider release that's with different packaging and artwork as well, which makes even less sense. Oh well. It's awesome and I love that they made this, but it's just a head-scratcher for me (as are a lot of Mondo releases). Something positive is that companies can see just how in demand this stuff is and will hopefully release a lot more video game music as a result."

vinyl,3dncfb,amenard,2,Fri Jul 17 17:51:33 2015 UTC,"Hopefully you can update the model when you come home from work. Without knowing the model, I will offer a couple guesses. If it's a belt-drive turntable, the belt may be worn and lost its elasticity due to age. Replacing the belt will often fix the problem. It may be that the pitch-control adjustment has build-up that is interfering with the electrical contact. Cleaning it with a quality electronics cleaner and lube can often clear out that build-up and allow it to work correctly."

It sounds like $50 might not be a bad price to pay for that alone."
vinyl,3dn8uc,one800higgins,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:01:43 2015 UTC,"I believe the hum is related to the power, and only seems to be a problem in the U.S., due to voltage differences. The Debut Carbon DC seems to have eliminated the hum that some Debut Carbon owners were experiencing."

vinyl,3dn8uc,one800higgins,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:07:44 2015 UTC,"I think it's worth the $50 for the motor and suspension upgrade, but I would go a step further, spend an extra $50 on top of that, and get the Debut Carbon Esprit DC, which will give you the Acryl-It platter upgrade and the speed control switch. Depending on how many 45s you listen to, the speed control might not be that important to you, but just the acrylic platter would cost you $130 as a separate purchase, and it is definitely worth having. It will dampen vibrations a bit, and it also eliminates the need for the crappy felt platter mat that I promise WILL drive you insane within a few days of owning the turntable. Trust me, unless your budget is so tight that you absolutely cannot afford that $100 above the price of the standard Debut Carbon, get the Esprit DC. You won't regret it.  Edit: sorry, after looking up prices, it seems that I was off by about $100. The Esprit DC would actually run you about $200 over the price of the original Debut Carbon. But assuming you are in the U.S., the Debut Carbon DC is currently available on Amazon for the same price as the Debut Carbon. I still think it would be worth it to go for the Esprit, but if you absolutely don't care about the convenience of the speed control switch, you could get the DC and then purchase the Acryl-It platter separately."

The speed switch is nice though, I will give you that, even if it doesn't allow for pitch control. I have a double LP and a single LP that both run at 45 rpm's and it slightly annoying to have to remove the platter before and after playing them."
vinyl,3dn8uc,Khemikooligan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:41:56 2015 UTC,"I also think the acrylic platter just looks better, not that that alone should be a deciding factor.

I actually tried a cork mat first, before switching to the acrylic, and I prefer the acrylic, but everyone's setup is going to be different."

The tonearm and the mechanism that attaches it to the table will definitely wear down over time with playing a badly warped record. Every time you spin the record, you have the equivalent of your annoying, unncoordinated little brother flinging the tonearm up and down. It'll put stress on the cartridge and the contacts for obvious reason as well."
vinyl,3dn3n8,kdrisck,2,Fri Jul 17 17:46:09 2015 UTC,Tonearm wear makes sense for sure.  Thanks for explaining! :)
vinyl,3dn3n8,paper-hanger,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:47:23 2015 UTC,"The tone arm's suspension is designed to float over the surface of the record even if warped. If anything all of the stress is going into the cartridge/stylus' suspension which again is designed to absorb such defects. Over time it will wear out like the suspension in your car. It is similar to how, after logging 100,000 miles you may need to replace the struts on your car. Playing an occasional warped record is okay. having the stylus leave the groove is not good and calls for a return of the record but make sure you have your TT and Stylus force set up properly before deciding of you want to send it back. Warps that can be seen but not heard are perfectly normal and nothing to worry about."
vinyl,3dn3n8,Loud_Vinyl_Disks,2,Sat Jul 18 08:21:32 2015 UTC,"I would recommend request replacement copies.  Warped records can, depending on the severity, cause damage to your table or needle in the long term.  Also warped records have less resale value if you ever decide you don't want the album any more, though that isn't much of a consideration on cheaper albums anyway."
vinyl,3dn3n8,Wizard-in--Black,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:42:14 2015 UTC,"While it's possible to increase to increase the tracking force to compensate for skips on a record, it is not advisable. Your turntable will operate best when the tracking force for your cartridge/stylus combo is within its recommended range. Increasing the tracking force beyond the recommended range will prematurely wear your records. Unless your records are badly damaged or defective, skipping when playing a record usually a sign to an incorrect tonearm setup.  What turntable and cartridge are you using?"
vinyl,3dn3n8,GothamCountySheriff,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:37:56 2015 UTC,Good to know... I am using the standard cartridge that comes with the Teac TN-300 (AT95E I believe).

vinyl,3dn3n8,astrovinyl,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:54:20 2015 UTC,"This was it! Thank you for the videos! I misinterpreted one of the steps. When I was setting it up, I had thought the rotating scale/dial actually adjusted the weight (I thought it was a very fine adjustment that wasn't noticeable...)- was confused when it did not work and assumed I did the balancing part wrong. I then adjusted the counterweight till the needle played vinyls without skipping. I guess that was probably the equivalent of 1g or less. Now it is set to 2.0G and plays flawlessly.  TY!"

vinyl,3dnwyb,gtfokenny,5,Fri Jul 17 20:48:38 2015 UTC,Turntable with cheap preamp  Another Turntable  Turntable + Receiver + speakers for $110 [I'd go for this]
vinyl,3dnwyb,GothamCountySheriff,3,Fri Jul 17 21:33:26 2015 UTC,"This JVC turntable looks to be a very good deal. The included Pyle phono stage (preamp) is junky, but will tide you over until you can get something better.   The Technics that /u/raspberrylagoon linked is an excellent entry-level turntable, but in my opinion is a bit over-priced. If it's truly ""mint"" $125 wouldn't be unreasonable, but would be the high-end for its class. $100 would be a fair price.  This NAD 304 integrated amplifier would be worthwhile if you could get the price down a bit.  The Design Acoustic PS-6 from this seller would be a very nice bookshelf speaker.  If you're are hesitant about used amplifiers and speakers, you can pick up a good entry-level receiver and speakers for about $200 if you catch them on sale (about $100 each):   Sherwood RX-4109 receiver (w/ builit-in phono stage) Pioneer SP-BS22-LR bookshelf speakers   Pair those with the Technics SL-QD33 (or the JVC L-A21) and you'll have a quality system that should last you years."
vinyl,3dnwyb,kpkethc,2,Fri Jul 17 21:51:28 2015 UTC,This could be a great upgrade.
vinyl,3dnwyb,tad8000,3,Fri Jul 17 21:26:33 2015 UTC,"I would ditch the built in speaker idea, and watch Craigslist/Goodwill/pawn shops and buy components individually. Will take more effort to find speakers, turntable, and stereo receiver, but the end result will sound better, as long as each component isn't complete junk.  Edit: To add a bit more info, since you're new, find a stereo receiver that has a phono mode on it. Also, check the needle on whatever turntable you can find... I would go with an clean, older turntable over a new plastic one. New needles can be pretty cheap and are easy to replace, if needed. Make sure the speaker cones are not dry rotted and are in decent shape. As I said, may require more effort, but you can definitely get a decent set up for $150-200 with some time and patience. EBay isn't a bad idea either, but shipping costs may be an issue. Once you get this setup, you can always build on it and upgrade your worst parts as you get more money and interest. Hope this helps."

I really wanted him to be the person to open this record and touch it for the first time.  RJ put on an amazing performance and he was even kind enough to give me a shout out in the middle of his set. Apparently, I was the only person who brought a record to be signed that nite. Which honestly surprises me, considering that's all he uses when he plays a live show. I highly recommend you go see him next time he's in your city.

vinyl,3dikln,chapmouse,2,Thu Jul 16 20:13:58 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: a bunch of meaningless rambling and pointless anecdotes... Sorry 😐!  First off I have the same turntable!  Also, I got my first ""Rush"" album in 2011, this old couple posted an ad on Craigslist advertising that they were selling their record collection. I get to their storage unit, and they tell me they only want to sell it as a whole, something like 800 records for $1200. The kicker was that a lot of them came from when the husband worked at factory that pressed the records, you could tell because they had chips missing out of the outta edge (to prevent resale), the labels were all handwritten, and none of these were black. So I start talk them into letting me do a little crate digging, and the wife keeps making me put stuff back, because she's worried it would ruin the value of the collection. So I switched this bad boy out with a ""Uriah Keep"" album. We argued over the price of six dusty classic rock and blues albums, I put them in my car and told them that when they were done ""letting them gather dust to shoot me an email"" they gave me a sour look as I drove away.  One time a bunch of us were taking shrooms and spinning records. I had this old nasty turntable I found at a junk shop, it had a 78 RPM setting on it and I played this album on that setting, and my buddy Dan looked at me and said calmly ""this is what they play in hell... Rush sped up!""     Edit: formatting"

Never having heard the track before, I had to go through them about three times to hear some differences. But I ended up choosing ""File B"". It had a tighter, more controlled low-end and a more revealing midrange, especially on the second singers vocals around 0:20-0:24 -- the subtle raspiness really comes through in whatever preamp ""B"" is. I'd be interested in finding out which one I chose."

Invented by Tom Moulton by a matter of necessity the format worked perfectly for DJs, producers and dance floors.   However, in this context albums didn't fair so well. Often they featured one or two stand out tracks for the dance-floor, and the rest was filler.   Most disco albums I own (and I own many), i tend to rate around 3/5 or less, even though they may contain some of the greatest songs in the history of dance music on them.   This can make it hard for some-one getting into disco who doesn't have the time or energy to spend on the singles bin. Thats not the case with these five though.   That being said, there are a tonne of 4/5s out there, and I hope you can share your favs in this thread.  But these five! Well these are complete unadulterated bangers and a must for any disco collection.  Enjoy!

There are definitely some that I've picked up because they were too good of a deal to pass up at the time and I haven't gotten around to listening to. I figure I'll listen to everything eventually. I have a few hundred records in my collection, so it's kind of a task to get around to everything, much less listen to things more than once or twice."

vinyl,3dljne,Timewindows,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:55:59 2015 UTC,"It depends on the age of the record.

vinyl,3dlmlf,poncia612,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:10:16 2015 UTC,Every thing you heard about Technics is right its a great brand that makes solid products. I would recommend buying it over the audio technical becuase the audio technical has no counter weight and no anti skate. From what I've have heard linar tracking turntables like the sl-5 sound great.
vinyl,3dlmlf,multipurposeuse,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:03:32 2015 UTC,"You already purchased the LP60, while not a great table, if you're just going to be spinning some dollar bin records it will do. If you're planning on buying new records, or collectable ones, I would opt for the SL5 which is a nicer linear tracking table."
vinyl,3dlmlf,adayinalife,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:47:02 2015 UTC,I have an SL-5 that I picked up at goodwill for $19. I put on an AT311EP cart ($32 on Amazon) and have to say that is sounds amazing with my infinity 363s and onkyo receiver! Tracks well with all but the most warped records. If it's is good condition I'd say try to talk them down a bit and go for it. It's plug and play and simple enough that my 3 ½ year old can actually use it (with supervision of course).
vinyl,3dlmlf,medrawgood17,-1,Fri Jul 17 14:49:06 2015 UTC,"Cancel it while you can. I don't know if I would specifically recommend the sl-5, it's probably one of their worst turntables. But still better than the lp60. I would offer $100- $120, $150 seems high to me."
vinyl,3dlmlf,MrRom92,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:18:17 2015 UTC,Huh?  It's a fine linear tracker along the lines of the SL-10.  edit: or are you aware of certain issues with the SL-5?  I notice there are a couple service supplements available.
vinyl,3dlmlf,LaserRanger,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:37:25 2015 UTC,"I'm just not a fan of either of them. Actually, not a fan of any of the 80's era mid-fi linear trackers in general. Granted, my experience with them is rather limited but I haven't found them to be as capable of a good quality reproduction in comparison to even a simple pivoted arm turntable. Linear tracking is a great concept but the motorized implementations were a poor execution IMO.  But again, still better than an LP60 (but what isn't?)"

vinyl,3djz4g,adayinalife,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:32:04 2015 UTC,"Not a hundred percent sure what you're asking. However if you're buying a full system I would opt for the 40/20/40 split in terms of money spent. i.e. if your budget is around $1k, 40% of it should go to the turntable, 20% to amp/phono and 40% to speakers."

I have one sitting right next to my VPI that I use to play records in VG or lower condition. It is built really well, has all the adjustments you need to tweek it for any cartridge. You can get extra headshells so you can have various cartridges to use in seconds. For instance you can use the stock cart it comes with for beat up records and buy a better cart for your new and NM disks.  In addition it has a 78 speed so you can play them if you get the right cartridge. It also has a built in strobe and pitch control.  All my current amps in use I purchased used. I'm currently running Adcom, NAD, Carver, Fisher, and Yamaha amps in separate spaces."

vinyl,3djz4g,GothamCountySheriff,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:10:03 2015 UTC,You can only plug the LP-120 into speakers that are self powered. The speakers would need to have their own amplifiers built in. The speakers would have to be plugged into the wall and the TT. This is not something I would look to do.
vinyl,3djz4g,Ossian1898,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:27:32 2015 UTC,"Ok that makes sense.  If I want this to go on my entertainment center and already have a surround sound, can I just use that or should I look into getting some standalone speakers specifically for the turntable?"
vinyl,3djz4g,Loud_Vinyl_Disks,-1,Fri Jul 17 00:36:54 2015 UTC,Where did you get that information?  I don't think that's correct at all.  I'm almost positive I've seen the LP-120 run through passive speakers.  Edit*  Of course OP would need a receiver for that set up as well.
vinyl,3djz4g,Ossian1898,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:36:33 2015 UTC,"That the LP-120 can't drive speakers? It can't. It doesn't have a power amplifier built-in and therefore cannot drive passive speakers.  /u/Loud_Vinyl_Disks is correct . The only way to connect the LP-120 directly to a pair of speakers would be if they were powered (aka active) speakers. Powered speakers have their own built-in amplifier and therefore require a power outlet. Every powered speaker I've ever seen or read about has an source input of some kind, typically with a line-level RCA connection.

I thought that he meant that you could ONLY use active speakers.  Hence me saying that the OP would need a receiver/amp to power the passive speakers.  I didn't realize that he was talking about ""directly"" connecting the table to the speakers."

If you've ever seen it, the lead actor from that 60's Romeo and Juliet movie does vocals on The Raven.  You should also grab Eye in the Sky and I Robot. Both albums are stellar and sound terrific on wax."

vinyl,3dgbb0,ShooterKingofMars,6,Thu Jul 16 01:29:25 2015 UTC,Thanks!  If you're a fan of punk/hardcore then hopefully you will dig it!
vinyl,3dgbb0,anticonnor,5,Thu Jul 16 01:35:03 2015 UTC,Just wanted to share an album of the artwork/packaging we created to go along with our debut LP.  A big reason I've been into vinyl for so long is the large and detailed artwork that comes along with it... I've long thought that artwork for a record is just as important an aspect of a release as the music and I love nothing more than when the two pair flawlessly together.  I think we've given it a pretty solid go at it and hopefully you all dig the couple of pics i posted!  Thanks for taking a minute to give it a look!
vinyl,3dgbb0,RobotsRevenge,4,Thu Jul 16 01:22:51 2015 UTC,That's gorgeous! Who were the artists that provided the illustration and packaging design on this?
vinyl,3dgbb0,Fiftybottles,6,Thu Jul 16 03:37:39 2015 UTC,The packaging design was all thought up between the guys in the band.  Our guitarist is pretty handy with photoshop so he assembled most of the layout to send out to printing.  The Girl/Muscle/Skull drawings were all done by our friend Hannah Medeiros.  She is a tattoo artist here in Boston if I'm not mistaken
vinyl,3dgbb0,Fiftybottles,6,Thu Jul 16 11:37:48 2015 UTC,Where can I buy a copy?

Been digging some METZ recently so this is right up my alley.  So tempted to buy one... But how do I explain it to my parents when the package comes in the mail after I promised them I wouldn't sink any more cash into vinyl this month?? :P"
vinyl,3dgbb0,ev149,7,Thu Jul 16 06:47:27 2015 UTC,Well the way I see it you've got two options.      1. wait until next month.  15 days isn't too long to wait right?      2. order one and just explain that we took our sweet ass time to ship the record to you and that you had actually ordered LAST month.  You know how the USPS can be sometimes!  ;)  Thanks for giving it a listen!

Best decision I've made in a while, I'm really enjoying this album. I'll probably cop the red vinyl when I have the cash lol.   Any plans to tour soon/play some shows? If you come to philly I'll 100 percent be there"

vinyl,3dgbb0,maakuz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:29:17 2015 UTC,Yeah we would definitely post about it on facebook and we have a 'shows' page on our limited run page.  Facebook is the most updated though I'd say... www.spiritshc.com  Hopefully we will see you in the fall!

vinyl,3dgbb0,MGrooms94,2,Thu Jul 16 01:27:05 2015 UTC,Thanks!  We originally had a different idea planned but the artist bailed on it so we threw this all together pretty rapidly in order to get the record out before our European Tour back in May.  We're all super happy with how it turned out!
vinyl,3dgbb0,bobbxfett,2,Thu Jul 16 01:27:57 2015 UTC,"If you don't mind me asking, why is the record so cheap compared to more commercial releases? Are you getting less profit than the commercial records are getting?  Good music by the way, only other similar music I've listened to has been Swain."
vinyl,3dgbb0,bobbxfett,5,Thu Jul 16 01:48:18 2015 UTC,"We're friends with all those tall handsome gents in Swain!  Great dudes and I wish we got to see them more than once a year.  Honestly I feel like the price is reflective of the genre.  Per unit, they were pretty pricey to make but kids in the punk/hardcore realm won't throw down $15 for a new LP most of the time.  $10 is for the uber punks, and as a small DIY band $12 is about the max we can charge.  We're also more than well aware that we will probably not recoup on the record within a first pressing and never really plan to 'make' money off of a record.  Playing in a band kind of always has been and always will be a money pit in our genre unless you're one of the few bands that hit and get a ton of internet hype.  We're cool with it and we'd also simply rather get the LP into someones hand for $12 as opposed to them passing on it at $15 I guess."
vinyl,3dgbb0,racer_xtc,3,Thu Jul 16 02:01:26 2015 UTC,"If you dont mind me asking, what company did you get to produce these vinyl? The cover is VERY creative. Kudos to you guys and congrats on the release!"

vinyl,3df9qp,ittakesacrane,10,Thu Jul 16 06:14:11 2015 UTC,"As someone who runs a record store and small web distro, I am totally disappointed in they way pricing has changed for 90% of the records we have always kept in stock. In many cases the wholesale prices are now more than our original retail mark up. It makes the long running stores look like price gougers but it's not our fault. IE: All SST merch went up 100%. That means our wholesale is actually more than the old retail. I used to sell at least one copy of Double Nickels on the Dime every week for $18. Wholesale is now $24. Beastie Boys (old sales price $22, new wholesale $24), etc. It's a real bummer to print price tags and rarely see a $18 anymore. It's mainly upper $20's and $30's."
vinyl,3df9qp,tonearm,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:08:56 2015 UTC,"Record store employee here and I can confirm this is the case. We keep a list of things that we will no longer order because they are just too expensive and we started sending it to our sales rep. It seems like it gets bigger every week.   The worst part is that the big labels are shooting themselves in the foot to make a quick buck. Even with increased demand and longer wait times at pressing plants, No Idea has raised their prices all of 50¢ on some stuff and they were already cheaper than major labels to begin with."
vinyl,3df9qp,Davekoen,3,Thu Jul 16 14:21:21 2015 UTC,"Yep. Maybe we should start that type of spreadsheet? That seems like a good way to voice an opinion. Manufacture cost has not went up, at all. The lead times are longer. That's it. They should realize from previous experience that a record buyer is more likely to buy three $15-20 records as opposed to one $30. Especially in our current market of digital access, we should be making efforts as labels to reward buyers for doing so."
vinyl,3df9qp,tonearm,2,Thu Jul 16 16:11:15 2015 UTC,"Manufacturing costs might have gone up marginally but spread out over the entire run, I'm pretty sure the difference per disk is negligible.    Just an example for people who don't get what we're talking about... When they reissued all of those Smashing Pumpkins LPs a few years ago, Siamese Dream retailed for for $24-$25 and cost the store around $15-$18 to order. That is a pretty small profit margin but we'd sell 3 or 4 a week so it was almost worth it. Now, with no difference in packaging, number of records, or barcode, that same record now cost us $36 and retails for almost $50. Sure we're making more money per record but it never sells (because who wants to pay $50 for a record that is in print?) so why bother ordering it? Our store just doesn't carry it anymore."

vinyl,3df9qp,Barrylicious,6,Thu Jul 16 13:12:14 2015 UTC,"A couple of things if you consider buying them:  The copy of Nine Inch Nails' Pretty Hate Machine they have on offer has been outright disowned by Trent Reznor. You want the one with the silver and blue instead of the blue and hot pink (old cover).  The copies of Ozzy Osbourne's Blizzard of Ozz and Diary of a Madman are the ones made around 2005 with Robert Trujilio on bass (this really shouldn't be a surprise to anyone who's looking for those two albums). Conversely, that's the cheapest I've ever seen Ozzy Live and it is definitely worth having."
vinyl,3df9qp,HansHitler,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:25:30 2015 UTC,Why did Reznor disown that particular copy of PHM?
vinyl,3df9qp,erizzluh,4,Wed Jul 15 23:20:04 2015 UTC,Because he said it was a money grab by the old label done at the same time he released the newer remaster on his own. I think it suffers from compression compared to the remaster.

vinyl,3df9qp,BriMarsh,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:37:06 2015 UTC,I did. I saw that one first because it was cheaper and I was sort low to high price and couldn't believe they had the standard grade for higher price. It always good to see the full list of the sale before making a purchase usually anyway.

In others, the newer copies can sound just as good if not better than some of the older pressings (especially mid/late 80s pressings of older albums).

vinyl,3df9qp,bkay28,3,Thu Jul 16 03:37:36 2015 UTC,"Depends on the album, if you are strictly collecting then of course you would want the original first pressings.    However if you just want to listen to the album I find that the new thicker records sound just as good if not better than some originals.  Depends if they messed around with remastering and tinkered with it.  I would look up reviews for any that you might be interested and take a chance on one, you might be pleasantly surprised."

vinyl,3dl2lu,adayinalife,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:34:26 2015 UTC,For sure! Since I have the cash would it be more worthwhile to pick up a U-Turn Orbit or just upgrade the cartridge on my Pioneer. I have a great set of speakers and a good receiver.
vinyl,3dl2lu,adayinalife,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:38:44 2015 UTC,"Tough call, getting a Uturn will not be an upgrade as such. But it's a stepping stone, as it has a standard mount, allowing you access to a greater number of cartridges in the future.  So in terms of seeing a direct improvement I would look into a Ortofon OMP-10 cart for your table. If you want to start thinking ahead look into the Uturn or perhaps a different vintage deck. You could potentially get a $100 vintage table + $100 cart/stylus and get the best of both worlds."
vinyl,3dl2lu,PM_Me_Annie_Drawings,2,Fri Jul 17 03:43:19 2015 UTC,Yeah. I've been checking for vintage stuff for a while hoping to get something nice. I think it might be a good idea to do what you said and get the Ortofon cartridge for my current table and wait for a better table to mount it to in the future.
vinyl,3dl2lu,adayinalife,2,Fri Jul 17 03:46:32 2015 UTC,"Just be careful, it's not straight forward to mount a p-mount cartridge to a standard mount deck. If you are getting the Ortofon cartridge, I'd plan on keeping your table for the foreseeable future. Otherwise if everything sounds fine, save the money all together till you can buy something nicer :)"

vinyl,3dgv0z,elvismcvegas,3,Fri Jul 17 18:22:26 2015 UTC,"I have Rain Dogs, you've got at least three that I want too. I need to check out more of his albums. So yes I fucking dig Tom Waits."
vinyl,3dgv0z,d-bone01,4,Thu Jul 16 05:13:00 2015 UTC,"I'm so jealous! Huge Waits fan. I own most of his albums on CD with a couple on Vinyl. Wish I had the whole set on Vinyl, though.  If you like Waits, you should really check out Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, and Captain Beefheart. The Captain was actually recommended to me by a local Record Store while we had s conversation about Tom, and I picked up Safe as Milk on Vinyl. No regrets! Nick Cave is sort of like Tom Waits meets Johnny Cash. Very cool stuff."
vinyl,3dgv0z,sarftheazure,3,Thu Jul 16 14:58:21 2015 UTC,Rain Dogs and small change for sure.
vinyl,3dgv0z,happydayz94,3,Thu Jul 16 18:36:04 2015 UTC,My favorite albums would be Closing Time and Small Change though I have to say that I love to spin most of them
vinyl,3dgv0z,H8Blood,3,Thu Jul 16 06:12:29 2015 UTC,"I have a copy of night Hawks with an all blue label, the owner of the record store is a big waits fan and almost did not sell it, probably my favorite album right now"
vinyl,3dgv0z,Lamlot,3,Thu Jul 16 06:41:34 2015 UTC,"If there wasn't any, I'd be severely disappointed, haha. Anyone else dig his new album? Very varied, but definitely killer."
vinyl,3dgv0z,scabdick,3,Thu Jul 16 06:51:44 2015 UTC,"I love Bad As Me. Favorite cuts:  Hell Broke Luce, Kiss Me, Chicago"
vinyl,3dgv0z,TheBeardedBeard,2,Thu Jul 16 13:36:02 2015 UTC,"When I first got this album on CD, it didn't leave my car for at least a week. Such a great album. Isn't he working on new music now?"
vinyl,3dgv0z,scabdick,2,Thu Jul 16 13:48:15 2015 UTC,I hadn't heard that. He did write and perform a new song for David Letterman's farewell.
vinyl,3dgv0z,TheBeardedBeard,2,Thu Jul 16 13:59:45 2015 UTC,"Maybe that's what I heard about. He's definitely getting old, I'm kinda worried I'll never get a chance to see him live... He doesn't have any tours coming up, does he?"
vinyl,3dgv0z,scabdick,3,Thu Jul 16 14:09:15 2015 UTC,"Maybe a controversial one but my fav is the Black Rider. It was my introduction to Waits, way back when & I've been trying to find a decent copy of it ever since."
vinyl,3dgv0z,atomike,3,Thu Jul 16 07:07:35 2015 UTC,"I'd love a decent repress too. Saw the play twice, a year or two ago, it was great! Though they had shuffled the songs around a bit to fit the narrative."
vinyl,3dgv0z,Thaddel,3,Thu Jul 16 12:57:56 2015 UTC,My favorite is Closing Time. Just so beautiful from start to finish.
vinyl,3dgv0z,jurgenknurgen,3,Thu Jul 16 16:51:58 2015 UTC,Managed to get an original copy of Bone Machine below $50 a while back. Still my favorite Tom Waits album.
vinyl,3dgv0z,lazylistener,3,Thu Jul 16 18:46:36 2015 UTC,"Big Waits fan. Just recently completed my collection. Went ahead and ponied up for Night on Earth. It was the last one I needed, now I have all of them. Next phase, replace some of the lesser quality condition ones with nicer copies."
vinyl,3dgv0z,themiggymigs,2,Thu Jul 16 22:37:21 2015 UTC,"Of the albums I own, I really like Blood Money and Swordfishtrombones. The next up on my wishlist is Mule Variations, but apparently I am really missing out on Nighthawks. Great collection btw"
vinyl,3dgv0z,Vintage_Threed,2,Thu Jul 16 11:32:13 2015 UTC,Swordfish Trombone!
vinyl,3dgv0z,Cabsack,2,Thu Jul 16 13:24:23 2015 UTC,"My favorite changes all the time!  Currently I'd say Small Change.   Small tip:  I recently purchased a new euro press (bootleg) of Bone Machine thinking ""it's not expensive it can't be that bad"" it was that bad. Cd sourced and can't even finish the final track because the auto return kicks in.  My local shop is great and I returned it no questions asked."
vinyl,3dgv0z,TheBeardedBeard,2,Thu Jul 16 13:34:46 2015 UTC,"I like the bluesy stuff.    Heartache and Vine, Swordfishtrombones, Rain Dogs, and Franks Wild Years.  Only one I own on vinyl is Heartache though."
vinyl,3dgv0z,isthishandletaken,2,Thu Jul 16 14:11:49 2015 UTC,Orphans is my favorite. It was the first album of his that I listened to so I'm sure that contributes to my preference. I just love the variety and the length. Every song is a hit for me.
vinyl,3dgv0z,zombiecake,2,Thu Jul 16 14:41:51 2015 UTC,Everyone always forgets about Blue Valentine. It kind of stands out from the rest as a bunch of murder/crime jazz songs.
vinyl,3dgv0z,BigDaddyDusty,2,Thu Jul 16 15:13:16 2015 UTC,"Nice collection! Nighthawks is fantastic. I actually stumbled on Bone Machine on vinyl a few weeks ago for about $20! I'm still not sure when it was pressed, but it seems a good few years old. When I found it, I kind of looked around to make sure it wasn't a joke being pulled on me because I've been looking for this record on wax for years."
vinyl,3dgv0z,Tim-Tim_Bisley,3,Thu Jul 16 16:46:12 2015 UTC,Maybe you got lucky with an original but I also picked one up recently that turned out to be an unauthorized repress - the cover art is pretty low quality and the sound is pretty lifeless :( it seems there are lots of new bootlegs of that lp going around these days.
vinyl,3dgv0z,2BaDebaser,2,Thu Jul 16 18:59:39 2015 UTC,"I was lucky to grab Orphans: Brawlers, Bawlers & Bastards when it was available. Now, I just need Night on Earth, Bone Machine & The Black Rider."
vinyl,3dgv0z,Altonspeed,3,Thu Jul 16 17:18:20 2015 UTC,Godspeed to you. Took me awhile to find decent deals on those last three.
vinyl,3dgv0z,themiggymigs,2,Thu Jul 16 22:35:25 2015 UTC,At this point I'm just waiting for legit reissues. From what I've heard the OG vinyl quality was less than seller. Vinyl being an afterthought in the early 90's.
vinyl,3dgv0z,Altonspeed,2,Thu Jul 16 22:44:26 2015 UTC,"Closing Time is one of my favorite albums ever, it's just so damn good. I have that and Heartattack and Vine on LP. Definitely planing on getting more of his stuff on record, nice collection!"
vinyl,3dgv0z,yeeah_suree,2,Thu Jul 16 18:18:59 2015 UTC,"I agree. I love both sides of Closing Time. I searched for it for so long too. It was the first thing I would ask for, whenever I would go into a record store. It has never been filed away into my collection. (600ish records) It stays in the regular rotation pile next to the turntable."
vinyl,3dgv0z,Qwiz,2,Thu Jul 16 21:22:17 2015 UTC,"Nice. Yeah, when I put that album on it's the only thing I do, it demands all my attention. I just sit and listen to it...maybe drink a glass of gin and think about all my previous loves, but nothing more. I was lucky I picked up an original pressing at Amoeba for about $12."
vinyl,3dgv0z,yeeah_suree,3,Fri Jul 17 00:51:37 2015 UTC,So true about it demanding my full attention. I hang on every note too. The timing is genius. Glass of scotch & ice in hand. Last record before bed on a Saturday night.  Cheers!
vinyl,3dgv0z,Qwiz,2,Fri Jul 17 01:15:55 2015 UTC,I still need Rain Dogs on vinyl.

vinyl,3dgv0z,Jmca1979,2,Thu Jul 16 18:56:04 2015 UTC,The Heart of Saturday Night
vinyl,3dgv0z,hobbsarelie83,2,Thu Jul 16 18:59:51 2015 UTC,I just got Mule Variations (2010 RSD repress) and I can't believe how good it sounds. Chris Bellman is doing the mastering and he's a magician. He remastered the first four albums and they all get glowing reviews as well.  I have the MOV Rain Dogs and I think it sounds great. I wish they'd do Bone Machine. Originals cost too much and there's expensive bootlegs too.
vinyl,3dgv0z,Zodsayskneel,2,Thu Jul 16 19:52:32 2015 UTC,Anyone have any suggestions on where to start with him for a first time listener?
vinyl,3dgv0z,jimmytheshooter,2,Thu Jul 16 23:09:34 2015 UTC,"You gotta go chronologically, start with Closing Time. You won't appreciate his later ""scraggly"" vocals and weirdness if you don't know where he started and how beautiful his music can be. Just start with Closing Time and go in order from there."
vinyl,3dgv0z,yeeah_suree,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:43:45 2015 UTC,First album I heard was Swordfishtrombones. Try the track 16 Shells from a 30-6  Edit: nighthawks at the diner is also worth a listen first.
vinyl,3dgv0z,thegentile,2,Fri Jul 17 05:21:43 2015 UTC,get glitter and doom live if you can find it!
vinyl,3dgv0z,mac13029,2,Thu Jul 16 23:35:52 2015 UTC,"Fantastic collection!  I have a certain affinity for his early years (really anything he put out on Asylum). His drunken delivery of the most sobering songs is unnaturally good. ""Small Change"" is the one that really hooked me, so I'm glad to see it's part of the collection.  ""So you ask me what I'm doing here  holding up the lamp-post,  Flipping this quarter,  trying to make up my mind And if it's heads I go to Tennessee,  and tails I buy a drink, If it lands on the edge I keep talking to you."""
vinyl,3dgv0z,moveablefeist,2,Fri Jul 17 03:51:38 2015 UTC,"Ah yes I know exactly what you mean. ""Small Change"" has a song called The Piano Has Been Drinking. It paints a picture of a ""drunk"" piano. So very creative and fresh sounding."

Shouldn't that be enough to deter anyone from buying a product? It's pretty much a bottom of the barrel system. It advertises 33/45 and 78 playback however you can't use the same stylus on microgroove records as 78s. For $200 you can get a Uturn Orbit, or a whole setup if buying 2nd hand."

vinyl,3dj2pk,D4FTPUNKF4N,3,Thu Jul 16 17:56:07 2015 UTC,"I do see reissue and repressing mixed up quite a bit so this will be good for people to get the terminology correct. A repress is literally just that - a repress. They take the parts and fire up the factory again.  On the other hand, reissue and remaster should be interchangeable. A reissue is a remaster, by definition."
vinyl,3dj2pk,MrRom92,2,Thu Jul 16 21:04:38 2015 UTC,"it seems a bit pedantic, I would say reissue and repressing are fairly interchangeable.   (hell even a remastered release, i would probably classify as a repress - its another pressing of the same record)   perhaps if they were to package it in such a way that there is no similarity with an original release (such as a box set, when records were only available as single LP's before) I would call it a reissue."

vinyl,3dl57y,adayinalife,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:05:17 2015 UTC,"The first question you have to ask is do you really need a analog setup at college? $350 can get you a rather nice digital setup that will easily outperform any new vinyl rig at that price point.  If analog is a must then I would opt for a Uturn + cue leaver (you dont want to manually cue while drunk), cheap phono stage (cheaper than the pluto) and maybe something like the M-Audio AV32 or Mackie CR3 powered speakers."

My reasoning is that there's a much greater scope for upgrading an RP3 than there is a Pro-Ject. That's all."
vinyl,3dhq5r,damnspynovels,2,Thu Jul 16 14:04:32 2015 UTC,I agree. Have you done any upgrades yet?
vinyl,3dhq5r,dethrock,5,Thu Jul 16 14:43:36 2015 UTC,"Yes. Quite a few.   A new subplatter from Gus in Argentina - i believe he calls it a Tangospinner these days, though he didn't really have a name for it when he made me one. http://tangospinner.com/web/home  An Achromat by Funk http://www.thefunkfirm.co.uk/turntables/page21/page21.html  Michell Technoweight http://www.michell-engineering.co.uk/tonearms/technoweight/  Dynavector dv10x5 http://www.dynavector.com/products/cart/e_10x5.html  and the rega white belt - which to be honest did nothing for me.   And of course added the TT-PSU"
vinyl,3dhq5r,damnspynovels,2,Thu Jul 16 15:09:05 2015 UTC,"Wow that's awesome! I just recently got the subplatter, dual belt pulley and feet from Gus at Tangospinner. I have a TTPSU as well and just bought a used Groovetracer acrylic platter (won't be here until next week.)  Next thing I'll be doing is upgrading the cartridge, which I'm thinking about the 10x5 as well. Or my dealer also recommended Goldring but I'm not too familiar with them."
vinyl,3dhq5r,dethrock,2,Thu Jul 16 15:15:26 2015 UTC,"For me, the 10x5 was the biggest upgrade. I mean obviously it would be considering it's quite expensive and is core to the sound, rather than being an enhancement like all the others.  It was also the last change I made too - all the others were done before then - and once more it was like night and day compared to the stock elys 2. it was a whole new world and i'm not sure I'll ever be able to go back to MM again.  My dealer did tell me that in his opinion I've basically maxed out the capabilities of the RP3, like there's no sense in putting anything better than the 10x5 on there, and that anything else I add (feet etc) would more than likely be a lateral change in sound, rather than an improvement."
vinyl,3dhq5r,damnspynovels,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:33:11 2015 UTC,See my question is if you drop 1k on the RP3 why would you even buy it if you plan to add upgrades? Like you could just buy a VPI or a Marantz tt-15s1 for the same price. Is there a reason i'm missing?
vinyl,3dhq5r,aj5dv,2,Thu Jul 16 15:47:18 2015 UTC,"Only the fact that (in UK prices, as that's where I am):  RP3 - £550 Marantz - £1500  so by buying the RP3, you can get a solid entry level deck that can be upgraded gradually to outperform the RP6 as funds allow.  Otherwise, no reason at all.  The same goes for any deck like this. You can get a serviceable LP12 Sondek for about £1100 on ebay, but you can gradually enhance / mod / upgrade it so that it will outperform the Majik spec version that you couldn't afford initially as it was over twice the price?"
vinyl,3dhq5r,damnspynovels,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:22:36 2015 UTC,ah I see. Yea I was always curious why an person in the US would do that. That makes sense to me now.
vinyl,3dhq5r,aj5dv,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:36:09 2015 UTC,"The rp3 is just within budget, but it would mean getting a cheaper pair of speakers than tye ones I'm currently looking at. I'm looking to spend total, around £900. Though, if I can fit my current amp to the Rp3 that may save me a lot of money."
vinyl,3dhq5r,damnspynovels,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:57:27 2015 UTC,"I'd really try and go for it. Basically, unless you think you're going to go all the way with hifi, there's no need to get anything better.   It's a long story, but as much as I've owned lots of hifi gear over the last 25 years, I found myself in a situation where I had to start again a couple of years ago as I'd been living in Canada, but decided to move back to England. And I bought used amps (Arcam Alphas) but bought an RP3 new as I figured it would grow with me as I improved on things elsewhere. Now I've since replaced the Arcam's with an old Naim set up from the 80s (and the equivalent cost of today would be in the £1000s new) and whilst it really begs to be paired with an LP12, the RP3 is more than enough to pair with it."

vinyl,3dhq5r,damnspynovels,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:00:09 2015 UTC,Is the RP-1 not able to be upgraded?
vinyl,3dhq5r,rjl_,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:05:22 2015 UTC,Not sure - but I don't think so. Definitely not to the level of the RP3 anyway.
vinyl,3dhq5r,adayinalife,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:08:15 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. Yes, it can be upgraded - you can replace the platter, sub-platter, bearing, cartridge, etc. And technically you can replace the motor, tonearm, wiring, pulley, etc. But at the point, might as well start with an RP3."
vinyl,3dhq5r,isthishandletaken,6,Thu Jul 16 20:50:08 2015 UTC,I'd go with the RP3 if it's within your budget.
vinyl,3dhq5r,clogger3030,4,Thu Jul 16 13:02:37 2015 UTC,"RP3 comes with the best tonearm.  So if money isn't an issue, that's the one to go with."
vinyl,3dhq5r,damnspynovels,2,Thu Jul 16 14:14:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, the RP3 actually has the same tonearm as the RP6. It's actually pretty incredible."
vinyl,3dhq5r,Jelmer2l,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:41:11 2015 UTC,"The tonearm (and to a lesser degree, the brace) was the main feature for the new model over the outgoing P3-24."

vinyl,3dhq5r,andy0702,2,Thu Jul 16 17:22:28 2015 UTC,"The Pro-Jects have been notorious for rumble for years. I had a ProJect 0.5 in the 90s, which was the precursor to the Debut range, and also a Debut III - and both suffered from exactly what you describe."
vinyl,3dhq5r,andy0702,2,Thu Jul 16 18:09:26 2015 UTC,hmm i think you cannot go wrong with either of this TTs... however as far as i can see Rega RP3 is most expensive ...  personally i have debut carbon esprit and it is great but i think is up to you to decide what to buy... maybe you can get some great deal on some of this models so that can help you ...
vinyl,3dhq5r,andy0702,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:41:44 2015 UTC,"I have been tempted with the sound box version of the esprit, my only issue is that it does seem a lot more extra money for not a lot more gain"
vinyl,3dhq5r,izzie833,2,Thu Jul 16 17:54:01 2015 UTC,i must say one thing you are doing wrong :-) you cannot compare debut cartbon with rega rp3....  you can compare it with rega rp 1- they are in the same price range...  if you are have a money for rega rp3 compare it with some other TT in the same price range (Pro-Ject 1Xpression Carbon Classic)... also if you want to spend that mount of money think about all other TTs you can buy... check some reviews etc....
vinyl,3dhq5r,damnspynovels,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:44:43 2015 UTC,"I wasn't comparing the cabon to the RP3, i know that the RP3 is a much better turntable than both, the carbon and RP1. I was however comparing the prices for the RP1 and the Carbon Esprit SB which i was saying is a lot of extra money for something that doesn't really seem that different from the normal Carbon.

vinyl,3dhq5r,damnspynovels,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:58:24 2015 UTC,"ok no problem...  i also would rather get better TT for the price of SB, or with better CAT... SB for me isn't upgrade which worth a money..."

vinyl,3djl6x,mtthwgss,2,Thu Jul 16 20:09:35 2015 UTC,"It can be normal within reason.  Take the platter off and set it down on a flat surface to see if the platter itself isn't plumb.  If so, there's your issue.  Or it could be a combination of that and the spindle not being completely plumb.  It generally does not cause an audible problem.  Reseating the platter on the spindle might help, I don't know if there's any simple way to fix it."
vinyl,3djl6x,LaserRanger,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:08:49 2015 UTC,"Hmm ok. Thanks for the reply. I can remove the mat but I don't think I can remove the platter. I've tried and it pulls up slightly but then no further. I think I'd have to dismantle the table to take it off, which I'm definitely not confident doing."
vinyl,3djl6x,LaserRanger,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:49:59 2015 UTC,"Pull harder.  It will come off.  Remove the dust cover first, because the platter might come off quickly and damage the cover.  Stack your thumbs on the spindle and pull straight up with your middle fingers placed in the holes on either side of the platter.  Try several times.  You will loosen it each time.  If that doesn't work, I understand that tapping the spindle with something like the plastic handle of screwdriver can help.  I had to take the platter off my D202 a while ago and it didn't want to lift off, but I kept trying and finally it came."
vinyl,3djl6x,LaserRanger,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:36:12 2015 UTC,I managed to get it off and my platter is maybe slightly off plumb. I cleaned it a bit then put it back and it's reduced maybe a small amount but it's still there.  Am i getting unnecessarily annoyed by this?
vinyl,3djl6x,LaserRanger,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:36:39 2015 UTC,"Am i getting unnecessarily annoyed by this?   That is the number one question for everyone getting into vinyl these days.  In this hobby, you will discover and rediscover all the reasons why we switched to CDs in the first place.  Maybe take a video of the platter spinning.  Try to get the camera at the same level as the platter so we can see the level of wobble.  I had an early 90s Pioneer turntable that did this, and I assumed it was made that way.  Mainstream TT build quality took a dive in the 80s.  Bottom line, vinyl playback is never going to be perfect."
vinyl,3din3v,Formermidget,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:02:15 2015 UTC,I'd either get a replacement for the 2225 or get an AT95E.

vinyl,3din3v,LaserRanger,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:53:01 2015 UTC,"the Shure will be more fun to experiment with, but the AT will beat it in every other measure."
vinyl,3din3v,LaserRanger,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:56:58 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks man. So as a beginner, I think the AT is the better choice with less grey area."
vinyl,3din3v,LaserRanger,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:02:12 2015 UTC,Undoubtedly.  But hang on to the Shure for later.
vinyl,3din3v,LaserRanger,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:16:19 2015 UTC,"So in general, and just to make sure I have this straight, the Shure is the better cart, but to get more out of it than I would with the stock AT, it would take significant investment, more than the price of the stock AT?"
vinyl,3din3v,MrRom92,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:21:48 2015 UTC,"It's not better.  It might be cheaper to get a decent replacement stylus for the Shure than to buy the AT, but the AT is an absolutely killer cart."

vinyl,3din3v,MrRom92,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:59:50 2015 UTC,"While I think the m97xe is better once upgraded, you should be able to get a really nice stylus for the 2225 as well - JICO probably makes an SAS for that as well. So you could go either way. But I would sooner invest in the m97xe than just a standard generic replacement stylus for this cart."
vinyl,3din3v,MrRom92,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:28:11 2015 UTC,"If I don't want to drop $100+ right of the bat, should I shy away from upgrading the stylus? Or is the 2225 good enough to justify spending that much on just a stylus upgrade? I'm leaning towards the at95e suggested in the other comment - thoughts?"
vinyl,3din3v,MrRom92,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:44:47 2015 UTC,"AT95e would be a definite step down, I certainly don't recommend it. The 2225 is decent enough to warrant an SAS and would definitely give you a great sound if you put a nice stylus on it but if I were comparing it to the m97xe if both had the SAS, then I'd say the m97xe has the leading edge.   Maybe you could just get the m97xe for now and worry about upgrading the stylus later on if you ever get the bug for setting more."

Unfortunately, I didn't have anything to play it with, so it just sat there for almost a year. In May, however, I started getting into vinyl; I started buying at my local record shop even though I didn't have a table. After realizing I wasn't going to make enough money to buy a table myself, I decided to replace the needle on my dad's old Kenwood KD-38R. I already had the receiver and JL-880 speakers my dad bought in the 80s, so I figured that would be the easiest way to go. It's a very humble set up, but I'm extremely happy to finally have one at all! Sunbather on 12-inch 45s sounds amazing."

The ""deluxe"" packaging was badly bent, obviously having been stuck under a bunch of other heavy shit in that shit mailer.    So I ended up with a $75 record that I'm afraid to play for fear of my shibata stylus.

vinyl,3de2yo,peaksix,6,Wed Jul 15 23:42:10 2015 UTC,"For charity, yes, yes. Which is why I was happy to pay $75 for the ""deluxe"" LP. However, a normal record costs about $6/unit to make at even a very modest order quantity. This ""deluxe"" packaging – the color of the vinyl really doesn't affect the production cost that much – might add $2-3 to the unit cost, especially given that they probably made 50,000 of them. So even if it cost $10 to make, I'd still expect some care being given to the delivery of the incentive for the donation. That's $65 they made for the charity. They could spare $0.10 for some stiffeners. That's really all it would have taken to keep the thing from being crushed the way it was.    I'm not trying to ""crusade."" I'm just trying to get a replacement."
vinyl,3de2yo,Roticap,5,Wed Jul 15 23:56:59 2015 UTC,"Wow.    Let's first remember, the entire ""Sleeping Tapes"" campaign was an advertising and public relations effort on the part of Squarespace to create both a beautiful, critically lauded website and an eclectic and creative product in the form of The Sleeping Tapes recording.  Go back and look at both the website and the commercials:   http://www.dreamingwithjeff.com/    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHCZebZzGJs  How far down in the hierarchy is NoKidHungry.Org? 6 levels? 8? It doesn't even show up on YouTube. That's because the charitable benefit was probably part of what got Jeff Bridges on board to do this in the first place, plus he probably got paid a decent amount by Squarespace. (Did he mention Squarespace at all in his podcast?)    Let's pretend you bought some kind of controller (or likely a headset) that enabled you to use it to play more of your Unturned game, and it was tied in with some hero of yours, and (!) it also happened to benefit a worthy cause. You paid 3-4 times what you'd normally pay for a product like this, and part of the ""cool"" factor is both that its unique and the sale was beneficial to some group of people. Then, you get this awesome thing you bought, and it's broken because they shipped it to you in nothing but a plastic shipping baggy and you're left with a beautiful hunk of plastic. Wouldn't you want one that worked?    Yes, I bought a record for a decent amount of money that happened to benefit this charity. But why does wanting a new, playable record make me an ""asshole?"" (Surely, it can't just be my watch. Really?) How dare you try to tell me what my intentions were.    The problem with the scattered point you're trying to make here, so aggressively internet, is that you are wrong and you're being an asshole about it.    TL/DR: That's not her toe, Dude."
vinyl,3de2yo,_FranklY,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:36:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but for Squarespace this was all about the marketing. They even made a case study about it to submit to advertising awards. So not entirely a selfless effort on their part.   Also, if you're doing charity work, transparency and accountability should be your main focus. It's very likely in the charity's best interests to make sure people that pledged any amount of money in exchange for a record (NOT a donation. There's a difference) feel like they wisely invested their money. Otherwise, they're shooting themselves in the foot."
vinyl,3de2yo,peaksix,8,Thu Jul 16 02:03:07 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if they don't make it right, I would have no issue disputing the charge with my credit card. When you pay a premium for something, the expectation is that they know how to package and ship it properly. Clearly this was not the case."
vinyl,3de2yo,eadem_mutata_resurgo,2,Thu Jul 16 03:45:25 2015 UTC,"The payment being four months ago is going to make that difficult. Most chargebacks have to be made within 60 days of the payment, though some cards will give you 90 days."

But conceivably the OP purchased this because they wanted the LP, otherwise they could have just donated directly to charity. And regardless of the cause, if you purchased something and it did not come as described, I think pursuing other options is completely justified.   Plus I know my credit card allows you to specify a chargeback other than the full amount. OP could easily request a partial amount if they're feeling generous."

vinyl,3dgen3,EgoGlacies,-2,Thu Jul 16 02:54:47 2015 UTC,"I wonder where they sourced it from, or if they even have permission. Too many ""official"" bootlegs going around. ""Never before released on vinyl"" without saying who mastered it for vinyl typically translates to ""sourced from CD audio"".  Edit: Morons can stop assuming that by ""typically"" I'm saying ""always"". I was being skeptical because there was next to nothing information wise posted about this and there's too many companies trying to get a piece if the vinyl revival pie without actually doing the legwork. If you disagree with that I'd love to borrow your rose colored glasses for a while."
vinyl,3dgen3,Zodsayskneel,5,Thu Jul 16 18:38:02 2015 UTC,Sly Vinyl for sure has permission. Their releases are never sourced from CDs.
vinyl,3dgen3,Zodsayskneel,-2,Thu Jul 16 18:41:01 2015 UTC,Well I don't know that. Does it say that somewhere on the site?
vinyl,3dgen3,Zodsayskneel,2,Thu Jul 16 19:09:05 2015 UTC,"Are you asking if the site states ""not a bootleg"" on it? Or are you questioning the labels' practices itself? Most legit labels don't have to explicitly state that they have permission to press stuff. Just look into the label a little and you'll see it's all super high quality releases. This isn't their first rodeo."
vinyl,3dgen3,Zodsayskneel,-1,Thu Jul 16 21:04:26 2015 UTC,"Just look into the label a little and you'll see it's all super high quality releases   ???

You want to gamble with your money, feel free. I personally think it's irresponsible to promote such a thing without considering the potential pitfalls."

This isn't their first rodeo.   This is literally only their fifth rodeo. That's an unproven company to me.  But hey, keep on downvoting me if it makes you feel better."
vinyl,3dgen3,Zodsayskneel,4,Thu Jul 16 21:58:30 2015 UTC,"If you look at the quality of the previous 4 releases, your concerns about quality would be easily put to rest. Every single one of them has been sourced from the original master recordings and has yielded a fine sounding and high quality pressing for each. The proof is there whether or not you choose to acknowledge it yourself.  I can say from my personal first-hand experience that SlyVinyl works directly with it's artists and right's holders of the particular albums they seek to be pressed. I will say that again. SlyVinyl works DIRECTLY with all proper license holders to not only gain proper legal permissions but also the master recordings to use as source material. This has been the case since day one and will continue to be the case as long as SlyVinyl Records exists. They will only use the best and most appropriate source material because the entire point of their label is quality, limited releases. There is no sales pitch. There is no marketing tricks. Just straight forward quality vinyl recordings in limited quantities. Period. Full stop.  SlyVinyl is not like Music On Vinyl who is known to source their audio from CD sources. Using the term ""typically"", as you did, is often true of many albums now being released on vinyl. The previously mentioned MoV label is a perfect example of that. However, ""typically"" ≠ ""always"".  I am here to not only state clearly that your concerns are misplaced but you're also clearly misinformed. I understand this concern as I personally care about audio quality and sourcing more than most anyone I meet in this hobby and they have not only met but exceeded all my expectations in that regard.  I hope this puts some of your concerns to rest. I'm not sure what else can be said but I'm confident if you're that concerned about production, mastering, and pressing information all of that can be made available. I will point out as bibLLiosoph stated that not many labels provide this information and it's definitely not ""standard practice"" by any means to provide it when albums are listed for pre-order or online order in general. Only a few like Original Recordings Group (aka ORG Music) make it a point to do this with every release. All that said, I'm confident I understand your concerns of quality and I believe you can feel confident when ordering with SlyVinyl you're getting quality and nothing short of it. It will, however, be up to your discretion in the end as to how and where you spend your money."
vinyl,3dfwl3,unEquals,5,Wed Jul 15 23:19:30 2015 UTC,"I was the exact same way growing up. My dad played all the classic rock and my mom played the contemporary grunge kind of rock. It wasn't until I was about 18 or 19 that I discovered KRS-One and subsequently hip hop as a whole. It really opened up a new world of music for me. Hip hop beats would get me to search for the artist they used in the sample and that has made funk and soul one of my favorite genres. More so than any other genre, I really think true hip hop artists embrace all types of music. I hate being the ""check this out"" guy, but look into Lord Finesse, if you don't already know him. His production work is widespread and on the mic, there is no one better at using similes and metaphors."

vinyl,3dfwl3,TheGiraffeRider,6,Sat Jul 18 04:17:26 2015 UTC,"I grew up on rock music. Whether it was my Iron Maiden/ Metallica phase in my early teens, to my ""classic rock is the only good genre"" phase (which lasted longer than it should have). Basically, I was a very close-minded child.   Eventually, a few years back something clicked. I discovered music properly. I began to discover all these different sub-genre's, my favourite of which being garage rock, which I consider one of the most underrated genre's there are.   Anyway, when I began to buy my own records, I definitely felt more confident exploring different types of music, but the most daunting to me, was hip-hop/rap. I didn't know a thing about rap. If you asked me a few years back to name as many rap songs as I could, I'd probably name a few Eminem tracks and that one Soulja Boy track, but that would be it.  I think that's why I was so desperate to find out if ""good"" rap existed. Luckily thanks to friends, my local record stores and the Internet, it didn't take as long as I expected.  The first rap album that I fell in love with was Mm..Food? by MF DOOM (all caps when you spell the mans name). That album, something about it was so fun and weird, It captured my attention and to this day is one of those albums where I find myself spacing out while listening to it. I can't do anything else while listening to it.   Return to the 36 Chambers by 'Ol Dirty Bastard was next. Again, I was fascinated by the album. 'Ol Dirt McGirt is one of the most interesting and crazy rappers ever to have graced the earth. Also I used to play Skate 3 all the time and I loved Shimmy Shimmy Ya but never bothered to check who it was by.   Next, is what I consider one of the greatest albums of all time. Run The Jewels 2, by Run The Jewels (Durr). This fucking album is incredible, and ever since its release to current day, it never ceases to hype me up and get me going. It's such a raw, powerful albums full of one liners I find myself screaming along to when listening to it. I have to play this album loud, there is no other option. Plus, Killer Mike and El-P seem like the coolest, nicest dudes ever, and I find Killer Mike's views on Police and current black culture fascinating (and that's coming from a white dude).   Finally, Sour Soul. I've been a fan of BBNG for a couple of years, so when I found out that they were releasing an album with Ghostface, I was over the moon. Now, lots of people were disappointed with this album, but I personally thought it was an exceptional effort from both parties. BBNG provided the catchy instrumentals, while Ghostface provided some brilliant verses. I love some of the guest spots on the album, my personal favourites being Danny Brown and MF DOOM's verses.   Nowadays I have a huge checklist of albums I need to get on record someday. Here are some of them:  Nas - Illmatic  A Tribe Called Quest - The Low End Theory  Action Bronson - Mr. Wonderful  Mos Def - Black On Both Sides  Any Death Grips album  Busdriver - Perfect Hair  Danny Brown - Old  Sorry for any spelling/formatting mistakes, I wrote this on an iPhone.

vinyl,3dhvr8,emilydm,3,Thu Jul 16 13:43:41 2015 UTC,"The matrix on Capitol-family records usually looks like SMAS-12345-J40. The first block of letters says whether the record is mono or stereo, the packaging type, how many records in the album and the original price. The numbers afterward are the catalog number. The letter following them (inscribed in the leadout, not written on the label) identifies the lathe they were cut on, in Capitol's Hollywood or New York studios or elsewhere. The final number is the lacquer number - how many times this album has been recut. For smaller run albums this might only be a few times, for larger runs like Beatles or Pink Floyd it can easily run well into the two digits, even into the hundreds for the White Album*.  *Fun fact about the White Album: all the lacquers and stampers were done and pressing was ready to be ramped up, when the Beatles got a test pressing back and discovered Capitol had remixed the album without their consent. So they made the label go back and start over with the correct mix. That's why the lowest lacquer numbers you'll find for that album are in the mid-50s or 60s."

I've seen info like this for specific albums, like Pink Floyd is pretty well documented. But I'd love a database or chart that I could compare a runout with and get a better sense of where a pressing was born and why."

I also commented with a link to a problem I've been having. I don't know if it's common/normal/easy or whatever, but I'd like some help.

Especially when you're paying $600 for them.   Not trying to be an asshole or anything, it just seems weird to correct me by saying there is no such thing as digital music on a forum about vinyl.

vinyl,3ddtw8,Passing_by_,-2,Wed Jul 15 21:46:00 2015 UTC,"The only ""digital"" thing about these speakers is the inbuilt DAC. Which is a bit of a pain if you're trying to do the vinyl thing. The KEF LS50's are literally some of the best speakers you can buy, but they're a little on the pricey side, if you want to maintain the analogness.

vinyl,3ddtw8,Uncle_Will,3,Wed Jul 15 21:50:37 2015 UTC,"How does using active speakers mean something is no longer analog? Only thing that changes is that the speakers have their own power source. The majority of active speakers do not have a DAC, so analog in = analog out."

When they shipped it out to me, the records inside damaged the top edge of the sleeve. If you order it from discogs, you can choose which color variant. For some reason the orange variant was much more expensive. I've heard the black one had less surface noise but I think the quality control is all over the place.  As for sound, it was very noisy. There was quite a bit of surface noise and a few clicks and pops every once and a while. I notified the seller and since it would cost way more to ship it back to Germany they just refunded a portion of the cost. It's an alright copy but the digital files are much better. I'm assuming at best they used the flac files to press to vinyl or at worst 320 mp3 or something like that.  I haven't listened it to a while but I used a Sanyo Q50 plus with an AT440MLA cart with Fisher X101st, Klipsch KG3 speakers. I'll have to check out my using my Shure V15 V with Jico stylus sometime since that's what's installed on the table right now.

There is this place in Johannesburg I've gone to called the collectors Treasury which has a whole floor filled with vinyl. They have over half a million records and nothing is organized so its still in boxes or sitting in huge shelves. Saw a guy come in with a portable record player one time while I was digging and he would use that to sample what was on a record. Thought that was a nifty idea at the time.

vinyl,3dclyg,YesLikeTheJeans,11,Wed Jul 15 05:36:39 2015 UTC,"At college this past semester, I was tasked at planning an event, to which I immediately booked an acoustic show for the lead singer of my favorite band Streetlight Manifesto, Toh Kay! I was so nervous leading up to the event because I love his music so much and was worried that he might be rude and ruin my dreams of meeting him. I was pleasantly proved wrong. He was one of the nicest individuals I have met, called me out by name during the show (which was crazy) and was kind enough to talk to fans afterwards. I left some of my records in his dressing room, along with a letter telling him how much he and his music meant to me. I only left a few in there because 1.) I didn’t want to be rude, and 2.) The Hands That Thieve was boycotted from the band and I wasn’t sure how keen he’d be on signing it (however I bought it from a record store so Victory already got their money, and I was just helping a local record store). However after meeting him, I know he would’ve signed them all. Overall it was a very nice guy, and I even got to take a picture with him on a Polaroid for him to sign.   TL;DR If you ever get the chance to meet Toh Kay, DO IT!"
vinyl,3dclyg,FoffT,3,Wed Jul 15 05:36:44 2015 UTC,"I was torn on buying the vinyl, too.  I ended up getting it for cheap from the Victory website when they had a sale and figured I'd balance it out by going to Streetlight's next last tour ever, whenever that happens."
vinyl,3dclyg,the_llama09,2,Wed Jul 15 11:13:05 2015 UTC,What do you mean by The Hands That Thieve was boycotted from the band? Do they not play those songs at shows or something?
vinyl,3dclyg,cok666n,5,Wed Jul 15 12:29:46 2015 UTC,"They play it of course. But they never received the albums from the label (Victory) who still released the album while Streetlight gets nothing for it.  Edit: I got the ""blank CD with a 10 poems booklet"" from their store since I pre-ordered way before this all blew over. I'm never gonna buy the vinyl by principle.

vinyl,3dgi13,goldswimmerb,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:41:37 2015 UTC,"I would definitely buy everything used. Find a decent turntable from the 70s.  Use audiokarma and vinylengine to lookup all the ones you see on CL.  Preamp/amp - at this budget, I would say find a really nice old 2 channel receiver/integrated amp & phono stage... probably from the 80s.  on CL, your search string should be something like ""stereo receiver"" or ""integrated amplifier"".   Just check them against the sites above for quality and phono stage.   Worst case, if you found something awesome without a phono stage, everyone seems to love these for a budget setup: http://www.amazon.com/ART-II-Preamplifier-Output-Switchable/dp/B000AJR482.   You can always upgrade later.  CL has tons of amazing speaker deals.  Get a nice pair of full-range speakers.  (the kind that look like a rectangle with 3 or 4 drivers)  I've seen insane deals in my area.  Here's 30 seconds of craigslist in my area, first link i clicked: https://newjersey.craigslist.org/ele/5106436965.html  My recommendation, don't skimp on speakers or turntable.  You can definitely find a vintage receiver with a ""good"" phono stage for next to nothing to get you started.  Also, remember that the names that are ""good"" now, weren't necessarily the names that were ""good"" back then.   Sansui made some of the greatest audio gear around in the 70s/80s... now they make cheap crap."
vinyl,3dgi13,cnuttin,2,Thu Jul 16 11:45:29 2015 UTC,"So is a stereo receiver / integrated amplifier, just the amp, no phono preamp? I also found this on craigslist Does it have a built in phono preamp?"
vinyl,3dgi13,cnuttin,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:17:17 2015 UTC,"some have phono stages, some don't.  vinylengine is good for getting specs.  Unfortunately, all it has is a picture for this.  But i found this on google: http://www.usedottawa.com/classified-ad/SANSUI-A-910-STEREO-INTEGRATED-AMP---NEAR-MINT--FOR-AUDIOPHILE-_17585613  it looks like it has a phono stage (there's a phono source selection, thats all I'm going off of).  Judging from the specs, that would be an excellent starter unit.  .08% THD, Made in Japan, Subsonic filter.  A little low on wattage, but back then watts written were generally real not like today ""800 Watts!"" and its like 800 watts peak at 2 ohms; 100 RMS @ 8 ohms.  That one looks very well kept and he even offers you to try it... can't hurt to check it out. You could probably walk away with it for $50 and then you have $450 to spread between the TT and the speakers.  I'd probably spend $150-200 on speakers.  Google the shit out of the model numbers you find.  There's almost always some threads online where people say either good or bad things about them.  Stick with high end brands of the era, high end audio has no resale value, but speaker technology just hasn't changed THAT much the way electronics have...   If you take your time and do you research, you could probably come out of this with a completely respectable setup for $500.  Well above entry level.  I live in NY at the moment, but I'm always in/out of NJ for family/friends.  Not sure what part you're from, but there's a handful of cool record shops scattered around.  My current favorite is ""Selling Tales"" in Hackettstown.  I hate to even share that with you since you're my competition, LOL... but I want them to stick around for a long time so I suppose they have to sell to people other than me.  disclaimer: i have no affiliation with any of the CL adds or Selling Tales.

I'm sure the speakers are good though, probably just some stupid connectors instead of binding posts.  EDIT: i just caught that those speakers are 4ohm... leave it to B&O to always do something weird.  Make sure the amp is rated to drive 4ohms or you'll damage it.  ""Normal"" speakers are 8ohms."

I went to their vinyl section and found nothing that caught my eye until I spotted multiple sets of giant boxes filled with vinyls. One particular set of soundtracks caught my cinephile eye. It was a silent auction with no bidders. This being my first silent auction I was nervous but decided to go for it with the $25 I had left. I put my opening bid down for $15 and wandered around some more. I came back only once after another person put down $20, so I raised him $25, all I had left on me. 30 minutes before the auction ends I return to see the outcome and find that my rival hadn't placed another bid. I began to get really excited and waited until the last 10 minutes when a guy comes up and asks if I'm the other bidder. I reply with a yes and he says to me, ""Honestly I only want the first box."" and I say, ""Wanna work something out?"" In the end, the other sets sold for about $530 and $310. I bought my set for $25, gave the guy the first box mainly filled with Disney soundtracks for his wife, he paid me $10, I thank him and walk away with 126 records at $0.084 a piece. The end."

Romantic, punchy jazz, funky, and a bit psychy - it's a joy. It also reminds me of this wonderful Greek composition: Giacondo's Smile by Manos Xadjidakis, a piece inspired by another metropolitan capable of romance, New York City - from Wikipedia:   In the course of a New York City parade, amidst bursts of music and colours and 5th Avenue flooded with people, I found myself one Sunday afternoon in the autumn of 1963. Then and there, I met a little woman walking all alone with a desperate indifference to what was happening around her; nobody noticed her, she noticed nobody; she was desolately alone in the unknown crowd shoving her, passing her by, heedless and hostile, leaving her to drown in the deep flood of the Avenue, inside that sea she was following, inside the wind beginning to blow.  I was riveted there, the only human being who noticed her. I tried to trail after her and follow her till I could get close enough to talk to her, without my knowing what I would say to her; but by the time I 'd made up my mind, I'd lost sight of her. I ran a little way ahead, stood on tiptoe in hopes of catching sight of her again, but the big black sea of people had swallowed her up. Inside me something started throbbing painfully. Without realising it, I'd come to a stop outside Rizzoli's Bookshop and in the display window, exactly facing me, was a book about da Vinci with the Gioconda on the cover. Incredibly enigmatic, she smiled to me, automatically enlarged to the size of the woman who'd just disappeared down the street.  I don't know why all these elements became strangely tangled inside myself, together with an exquisite motif by Vivaldi, which I had heard several days before this and which had continued ever since plaguing my memory tyranically.  These ten songs were composed with a blend of despair and reminiscences. The theme is a solitary woman in the big city. Each song is a monologue of hers and all the songs together compose her story. A story which is modern and, yet at the same time, old."
vinyl,3dbf63,marbleriver,2,Wed Jul 15 08:18:18 2015 UTC,Partridge Family records are always enjoyable pop. That's their first. What are the two in the top row between Charade and Butch Cassidy? That Elton John Friends album is one that used to haunt me in every thrift shop.

It won a grammy for best motion picture soundtrack when it came out, and in my opinion is one of the best soundtracks from the 80's for all of its synth-funk glory. Although, many complained because it didn't include Nasty Girl by Vanity 6 from the strip bar scene, but it can still stand on its own without it. Some personal highlights being: The Heat is On - Glenn Frey Neutron Dance - The Pointer Sisters New Attitude - Patti Labelle  and of course Axel F - Harold Faltermeyer"

vinyl,3dg9oy,Golden_Bear_,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:15:46 2015 UTC,"I can say for sure the turnout is between 400-500 people throughout the day.   As for hip hop, it's a bit uncertain. The dealers don't really tell us what they bring, but from my experience I have seen R&B at each show from various dealers, and it usually seems to be older stuff. I would not say it's a big hip hop show, but it certainly is somewhere among the dealers."

vinyl,3deeft,thodelife,4,Wed Jul 15 20:17:08 2015 UTC,"Some sites have sprung up in the wake of vnyl but some are actually good.  Vinyl Me, Please is a great subscription service, offering you a personal taste every month as well as exclusive deals (last month there was a 20% off in the Merge Records shop to VMP member) and a monthly store that sends with free shipping (in US only) and ships with your package. Send me a PM if you want a free record deal with sign-up; you and I will both get a free random record if you sign up through the link I send you!  Castle Vinyl is something I like talking about, especially since a user on here does the service. He gives you a selection of genres to pick for each month, with added bonus for a higher fee (7"", and 7""/memorabilia, respectfully with price). What he gets aren't exclusive to him as of yet, but I do like seeing their progress. wildebeests27 is the user, if you wanna leaen more about Castle.  Something I was just exposed to is an upcoming subscription service called Rebellion Box, highlighting punk music. I have no idea when they'll start their service, but you can sign up to be notified. http://www.rebellionbox.com/?kid=6CWD6  VinylMnkey is like VMP as it does exclusives, unlike most of these subscriptions. However, it promises first pressings--exclusive to the service--from only indie bands (signed or independent). I don't use it myself but it's worth taking a good look at!  And Vnyl.....please.....just stay away. It's a massive trainwreck. Save yourself the misery of going through them."

My other service is https://feedbands.com it's all unsigned bands and you listen to them in a stream, up and down voting them. At the end of the month, whoever got the most votes gets a record pressed. Obviously everything is super obscure, you're not going to get any Beatles records from them, but it's lot's of fun and a great way to discover and promote new music you enjoy."
vinyl,3deeft,swilkeni,2,Wed Jul 15 20:27:35 2015 UTC,I second Feedbands. Definitely look into this one.

vinyl,3deeft,notreallyclever,2,Wed Jul 15 21:19:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they do a shit job describing the subscription service online.  Every month to six weeks they release two reissues in the series.  If you subscribe, both are sent to you.  Each release is $35, so each month or so is $70.  The real value of the subscription is that you are guaranteed a copy of each release. These releases are spendy, but totally worth it.  The pressings are immaculate, the sound quality pristine, and the jackets are heavy glossy cardstock gatefolds with killer high resolution B&W photos on the inside.  Not to mention that buying clean original copies of these releases would set you back hundreds in many cases. I am a subscriber and i love this series.

I chose Castle because of the genres you can select from, Vinyl Me Please has no music that interests me. I am still pretty new to records, so Castle Vinyl made sense to me to help build my collection. Plus, customer service is great.  I picked the Alternative genre and here's what I got so far: * LP: Nirvana - Bleach & 7"": Red Hot Chili Peppers - This Is The Kitt / Brave From Afar * LP: Meatpuppets - self titled & 7"": Jack White - Lazaretto"

vinyl,3dd5qs,ShadowKing94,3,Wed Jul 15 17:23:53 2015 UTC,"Although ""Powerage"" may be most musicians favourite AC/DC record, it is a nadir as far as Bon's lyrics go. Having said everything he passionately felt in TNT's '""The rock 'n roll singer"" and Dirty Deeds ""Ain't No Fun (Waiting 'Round to Be a Millionaire)"" Scott turned his hand at tried and tested songwriting methods to finish his contributions.  Ironically, the Young brothers were at their peak riffage, ""Sin city"" and ""Riff raff"" are among their most engaging riffs.  The closest Scott gets to a confessional is ""Gone Shooting"" but the structured professional songwriting is a poor substitute for the raw emotion he poured over earlier albums."

The place I was meeting him is around the corner from a thrift store, one I hit yesterday afternoon, but I figured I'd go kill some time there. Walked in the door 15 minutes before closing and went to see if they'd put out any new records in the last 24 hours. Noticed a stack on the end that wasn't there yesterday and took a look. This was that stack. Lesson is: go.every.fucking.day.

EDIT: Actually, I think the type of person who would watch a 10 hour experimental film would be their target market. People who would be into it as an art project, not just a song played on repeat. I already own the song, so I don't need it on an endless loop. Who knows, maybe this thing will be worth 2 grand when no one ends up buying it. I personally don't collect things just to own them, but some people might, and that's okay in my book!"
vinyl,3d95qd,MEK42,6,Tue Jul 14 16:49:02 2015 UTC,"I bought it as a huge The National fan and to be honest: it's so beautiful. It sounds like a very long song instead of one song on repeat for 6 hours. Each version has its own 'hidden treasure' and towards the end, Matt gets really emotional and you can hear him break. You can hear the band evolving and getting tired (but not less focused).  I know it's expensive and I understand the questions of some people about the use, but I can definitely recommend it if you like 'Sorrow' and The National."

vinyl,3d95qd,mercury14,2,Tue Jul 14 19:44:02 2015 UTC,"I didn't buy it, but that's how I looked at it. The music is a piece of art, and they released it in a well designed set that is also a piece of art. As a fan, if I had the money to spend, I'd have bought it for my collection. But it was an easy one to pass on at the same time. I don't think it's a stupid purchase though by any means for anyone who did buy it."

vinyl,3d95qd,happydayz94,3,Tue Jul 14 17:13:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think it was a ridiculous thing for them to do at all. It was part of an art exhibit that the piece tied into thematically. I recommend watching ""The Artist is Present"" on Netflix, it shows just how powerful an endurance piece like this can actually be.  With that said, I just think it was an unnecessary thing to have on vinyl. But if you don't want it, don't buy it I guess. I'm not pissed that it exists or anything, hah."

vinyl,3dfh9j,QuincyHarvey,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:00:01 2015 UTC,"The set of five sliders, as someone else said, are you are equalizer. From left to right, they go from low-end to high-end. Don't worry too much about these, and just set them to what you think sounds right. If your ears aren't tuned enough yet to recognise frequencies in music, they will be soon.  I've only ever used manual cueing record players, so I don't exactly understand how your cueing knob works, but if you've been able to play records already, then you probably already know that the two settings indicate the needle off and on the track. I've done some research, and apparently the ""Rej"" button means ""Reject,"" and should simply lift the cueing lever and return it to it's resting spot.  The anti-skating knob essentially counteracts the natural ""inwards"" motion the lever takes as a record plays, so you generally want it to be set to the exact same number as your counterweight. I hope you already know how to correctly set your counterweight for the new cartridge you bought. Enthusiasts may suggest different settings for your counterweight and anti-skating, but if you don't know what you're doing it's safest to follow manufacturer instructions.  I only recently adopted the vinyl lifestyle, but I already had a sizeable collection of my dad's records and my own knowledge of music's technical aspects to help me get into using the equipment correctly. I hope you like playing records as much as I do!"

vinyl,3df0qj,GothamCountySheriff,2,Wed Jul 15 20:18:34 2015 UTC,"The TC-750 is fine. Sometime back I had a shootout between the Pyle, Behringer, ART, and TC (along with some other higher-end phono stages). Of the external preamps I tested, I settled on the ART DJ Pre II. Between the TC-750 and DJ Pre II, I thought the DJ Pre II had better clarity, a more neutral sound and better separation. The difference between the Pyle and Behringer was somewhat noticeable (I don't think they're the same OEM, but I didn't do a tear down so I can't be sure), but the difference between the Behringer and DJ Pre II was very obvious. The difference between the DJ Pre II and the TC-750 was more degrees of subtlety than stark difference."

Other options out there, if your wondering and willing to drop some more, is the new Pluto by Uturn. I can't recommend it yet not knowing what others think and not having use it myself. I'd get one if I was in the market for a pre-amp. I'm currently using a NAD PP2 which I would only recommend if you can get it on sale. It's a pretty nice unit.

It's an illegal USSR bootleg of Led Zeppelin IV and Houses of the Holy which was switched to Led Zeppelin V as the original title did not translate in Russian. The cover of IV was changed because the original picture of a peasant carrying a bundle of sticks was offensive to the poor working class of the USSR.

That being said - the 72 you have listed are very common records.  Some (tom petty, the who etc) might sell if condition is right and price is right, but most on that list will be very difficult to sell.  Just because they are LISTED on eBay at those prices doesn't mean they sell.  Most of those records you have on that list will be difficult to sell at any price!  Also it's important to remember that eBay will take a cut of the sale, PayPal will take a cut of the sale, and you will need to buy the proper supplies to package and ship the records safely. If there are rare gems in there in fantastic condition (you never know!), then you may be able to sell for a considerable profit, but trying to sell commons in this way (particularly when you really don't know about records) is very very difficult."
vinyl,3df5dy,Timewindows,-1,Wed Jul 15 20:42:24 2015 UTC,"Oh don't worry I know! I bought these with the intention of flipping them, I'm an eBay seller. I just don't know much about vinyl so I know expanding my knowledge will help draw higher prices.  I haven't gone through them all, but I'm looking at Discogs now for listings. It is very fun! If I can make back my money on this I consider my knowledge broadened for future use. If I can make profit then I'm even more excited.  Most of the eBay prices I have listed in the Excel sheet are from sold listings, at least the ones I could find.   I hope in the end the money I make can go towards starting my own collection. And buying a record player first."
vinyl,3df5dy,pithyretort,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:59:30 2015 UTC,"You can see stats on how many people want a particular record and what they have actually sold for on discogs.  Look for that info.  Also know that on these records you have, if they have sold, they were very likely in vg+-nm condition.  That means that they are 100% scratch free and in close to perfect condition."
vinyl,3df5dy,pithyretort,0,Wed Jul 15 21:05:17 2015 UTC,"Mine don't look too used either. No real scratches I can see, though I'm not sure how deep scratches have to be to have a big impact on the quality."
vinyl,3df5dy,jackholexxxx,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:17:00 2015 UTC,"The nice thing about Discogs is that if you add them to an account, it will tell you the low, high, and median price the album sold for using the last 10 sales as well as the low, median, and high estimates for your collection as a whole. Might help you get a sense of which ones, if any, have value."

vinyl,3df5dy,PeanutButter707,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:50:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's why I might avoid eBay for these, many have suggested Discogs, and another suggested a local record store for leftovers."
vinyl,3df5dy,Ossian1898,0,Wed Jul 15 21:02:01 2015 UTC,A bunch of people have mentioned Discogs and I think listing them there instead of eBay might fetch more. I'm just unsure about grading it all.  Some Who albums and this one Monty Python album have me interested. I'm still not sure what else I have.

vinyl,3d9hiy,DontTouchTheWatch,7,Tue Jul 14 15:29:57 2015 UTC,Hi Guys! I've been lurking around this sub for a few weeks now and figured I'd post my most recent pickup. Vinyl as become my new obsession and I love visiting flea markets to pick stuff up.  This however came from eBay and I was pretty nervous considering the seller had no idea how to check condition. I made sure I could return it if it was damaged and described to him how to check for warping and damaging scratches.   Luckily 38 dollars and a nice clean later and I've got this original pressing in my hands. I don't have too many hip hop albums but this one was a must have for me.   Glad to be here and look forward to seeing what everyone finds and sharing more!
vinyl,3d9hiy,PerceptionShift,2,Tue Jul 14 16:29:21 2015 UTC,"Nice! I got mine in shiny shiny NM- for $50 in Seattle. This pressing truly sounds incredible, it's very well done. I prefer the original mix & mastering over the remaster too. While the remaster does sound 'objectively' better, I prefer the somewhat weirder moments of the OG."

However, it's free to list (unless they've changed that recently) and eBay I believe takes 10%, and Amazon charges $1 to list each item and also has a final selling fee, although I forget what it is. Discogs is definitely your best bet for selling, unless it's a super wanted item that's guaranteed a bidding war, in which case do eBay."

vinyl,3dbul6,Vebberim,3,Wed Jul 15 02:35:38 2015 UTC,"Not as well known as those two you mentioned, but when I got the Lapalco LP by Brendan Benson on vinyl, it's an album I've listened to at least 100 times, on CD and later Spotify. The song ""Metarie"" is a completely different version on the LP and I can't find that version anywhere else."
vinyl,3dbul6,arthurbang,2,Wed Jul 15 01:51:02 2015 UTC,"There are so many released versions that I can't remember what ended up on the LP, but if I recall correctly he used the single version of ""Metarie"" rather than the original album version.

vinyl,3dbul6,_cruster,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:24:23 2015 UTC,"I'm curious about this, actually. My favorite version of that song is one a friend put on a mixtape back when that record was new. There was no 'stuck like glue' lyric in the chorus, just a repeat of 'something I've been meaning to say to you' and some of the other lyrics and background stuff was different too.   I've never been able to find it since, and that mixtape is long gone.  I also never even looked for that record on vinyl, as it's in that early 2000s time period where nothing new that you loved came out on wax.   Off to check discogs for Lapalco and One Mississippi now."
vinyl,3dbul6,clapyrhands,3,Thu Jul 16 05:51:44 2015 UTC,"the version of ""burning up"" from madonna's debut album has very different parts in it. i'd had the cd since forever and knew the song inside and out, so when i finally got an original pressing of the record i was quite surprised to hear the differences from the cd."
vinyl,3dbul6,freelittyta,2,Wed Jul 15 03:50:44 2015 UTC,"Happens on quite a few records. A few things that I've noticed on things I own:  The end of Three Evils into The Crowing on the original press of Coheed and Cambria's In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth is a continuous track on the CD, but on the vinyl the songs are on different sides so the end of Three Evils ends with the shout and The Crowing has a cold opening where you can hear a few notes hidden on the CD version.  All of Year of the Black Rainbow also by Coheed uses a different mix on the vinyl with much less compression.  Atoms For Peace's Amok I've also noticed uses a completely different mix than the CD and there's lots of hidden backing vocals and synths and such.  It's a lot more common than you'd think."
vinyl,3dbul6,SirNarwhal,2,Wed Jul 15 03:41:27 2015 UTC,"i own the fragile by NIN. it has two extra tracks, a truncate final track, the crossfades are split and don't fade between sides, and several tracks are apparently longer."
vinyl,3dbul6,arachnophilia,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:35:00 2015 UTC,"Earlier CD versions of ""Graduate"" don't have that either. My CD doesn't have it (it just starts ""Can I graduate""), but the version on Spotify does have the extra initial part.  Honestly, on the new version that's on Spotify, they superimposed the second vocal parts WAY too much. There are extra ones in the outro, too. I have no idea why this remastering was put out there; the original was fine..."
vinyl,3dbul6,hackmiester,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:28:54 2015 UTC,I think I downloaded the album a few years ago from iTunes and it had that extra part in it. Then I got the vinyl reissue last year and it didn't have that.

Before the I had a cheap Lidl (a european discounter) turnatable with no counterweight, etc. Basically like a crosley without the cool design. I used an old and small aiwa system as amp with Speakers from Hitaka (100 W, not really anything about them on the internet.). I wanted to upgrade my setup and first thought about a dual dtj 301 with a chinese digital amplifier. But because of a friend and another forum I now got myself a full analog setup. I purchased the turntable from a guy that repairs and then sells vintage turntables with guarantee. I paid 140 € for it. It came with the technics 270c system, if anyone knows how good it is, it would be cool to tell me, since once again not much to find on the internet. The amp is the technics su A-600  MK2 which I got for 80 € from ebay. So far I'm happy with the setup and it's great this subreddit and forums convinced me to get something good for the money and not cheap plastic stuff."

So much for impulse clothing purchases. This old fart ain't wearing any of that crap they sell in Rare, that's for sure. (/rant)"

Other than that, good stuff is rare, around here it's 99% classical/orchestra, 1% 80s music that I'd buy if the record wasn't cracked or scratched beyond playability"
vinyl,3d693i,The_Narrator_9000,3,Mon Jul 13 21:42:40 2015 UTC,"Ugh. I went into a local thrift store recently and they had stacks of 45s hanging loose on hooks. If you weren't careful you could easily drop them while browsing, which has clearly happened, because a number of them had chips broken out of them (including one single that I really wanted).  The best part was when I took all the broken records I'd found up to the checkout to have them take them off the shelves. I told the cashier that they were broken and she stared at me blankly. ""So do you want to buy them?"" she said after a couple seconds.  I had to stop for a second. ""No, they're broken. They can't be used."" ""Oh,"" she said. ""So can you take them off the shelf?"" I said. ""Yes,"" she said and put them next to the register. I assume they were put right back out again after a few minutes.  I tried."

Almost everyone works for Walmart or for a company connected to Walmart. Most companies that do business with Walmart maintain an office here. There are a lot of transplants from around the world, so the population is a bit less homogenous than other parts of Arkansas.   The Walton clan also live around these parts, so it's not uncommon to find yourself stopped at a red light behind a billionaire. They just built a nice art museum a few years ago, a concert venue, a children's science museum and a $16 million community center.    Also does this mean your Walmart is especially...nice?   Haha, the one directly across the street from Walmart's HQ is an older store, so it's not especially nice. We do get new Walmart things first though. There's a grocery pickup depot where you can older all your groceries online, drive up, pop your truck, wait for them to load your groceries, then drive off.   And now I sound like a Walmart shill (and I don't even work for them), so I'll stop there."

Best resource would be vinyl engine and audio karma. And Steve hoffman. You are right to go about lifting dimensions from the current table. Back in the day some turntables even provided the template for you to create your own plinth.   As for geometry of it all, it's dependent on the tone arms you're wanting to use. For the most part it will give you a radial distance from the spindle. The Altmann table had a unipivotarm with adjustable height. If you want to have a tt with multiple arms you'you're really going to have to build out the plinth. The adjustable height for the arms should be there to get you level with the platter when balancing. Zero off the platter would be the best bet so you ate not relying on other things to get you to the right height.  Building turntables is a precision endeavour too. The easiest thing to do is refurbish and redo the furniture. The hard things to source are the actual mechanics. The Altmann table is the best complete from scratch table I've seen out there and it's made of cnc routed wood."

Super Flea Market - Kingsway - Terry, he is one of the best for pricing, bootlegs and original releases, if he doesn't have it in stock on the shelves, ask him.. he can get it.  Revolver - Located in malls, laughable pricing on new releases, great pricing on used release (Sometimes) HMV - Lots of new mainstream releases.    lastly. you may want to try ""Timber Tone Audio"", this place is in Ponoka, decent selection of 70's and 80's and a vast selection of mid to high end turntables and relatively acceptable pricing, unfortunately a little bit of a drive to Ponoka.  https://www.facebook.com/timbertoneaudio?fref=ts"

The trick is to get the shortest, thinnest cable needed to carry the maximum rated power load directly from the source to the destination. That will yield the cleanest signal.  Using thicker than necessary cables (too high resistance) can lead to signal/clarity loss and low frequency attenuation. Using too long cables (too high capacitance) leads to high frequency attenuation. Long length cables (except optical or differential signal) also sees significantly increased noise floor, hum from mains power, and RF signal interference.  TLDR: If you are experiencing hum, hiss, or or interference due to long cables, upgrade to inexpensive shorter cables rather than fancy brand name cables with space-age looking connectors and weird colored sleeves (unless you're in it for the looks rather than the sound)."

They've had their fair share of criticizers but they've also become massively successful since their debut album was release a little under a year ago.  I was lucky enough to become a fan early on and I have every one of their releases.  I wouldn't own quite a few of these if I hadn't been able to buy them for their shop prices as they now go for stupid sums of money online.  If there's anyone that doesn't know the band, I urge anyone who enjoys dead solid, catchy rock to check Royal Blood out."

vinyl,3da6jq,funky_pretty,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:22:28 2015 UTC,"What alignment method did you use? I'm using the same cartridge/tt combination and I'm not having much noticeable distortion. That said it's my home office setup and I'm just using desk speakers, so maybe I'm not hearing it.   I haven't taken the pre-amp out. My only modifications were to use a thicker cork slipmat to make the tonearm more level. Aligned the cartridge using the 52mm method. Tried protractors but they gave me worse distortion."
vinyl,3da6jq,charlesdemar88,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:34:08 2015 UTC,I used the supplied Shure alignment protractor (Baerwald I think it is).  I'll try the 52mm method instead because I have spent hours getting the alignment right with the Shure protractor and I know I got it right.
vinyl,3da6jq,Zodsayskneel,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:14:07 2015 UTC,"Buddy, I've been through it and through it and through it. As far as I can tell I've completely eliminated IGD from my M97xe setup. I think the reason half the population thinks it tracks poorly is because they have it set up wrong. The way you're talking about doing it is also wrong.  Before you pull your hair out trying to align this as I have (look how fucking crazy I got over this) is make sure your suspension isn't blown. Do this by placing the needle on a stationary record, view the cantilever position then getting the record up to speed either by hand or by starting it. Does the cantilever change its offset? There are some pictures on page 2 of that link I posted that illustrated what I'm talking about.  I sent my cartridge back to Shure and a week later they sent me a new one. I lined it up using THIS ALIGNMENT. This is a Baerwald alignment like the protractor that comes with the m97xe, but it uses DIN null points instead of IEC. I know this is going to sound stupid, but I decided to try DIN because it's a Japanese standard, and Technics being a Japanese 'table… well that's where the logic ended but the result was an overhang closer to what Technics specifies for tonearms of this type, which I believe is the same as yours.  Give me a shout if you have any questions."

vinyl,3da6jq,Zodsayskneel,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:43:36 2015 UTC,Did you give this a shot?
vinyl,3da6jq,Zodsayskneel,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:51:07 2015 UTC,"Ok, I printed out the tool using some file I already had on my computer so it was scaled correctly, etc.  I played a mint Analogue Productions Little Deuce Coupe (Stereo) again and I sensed a negligent amount of IGD. Which hasn't been too big of a problem on my brand new records.  The sibilance on ""A Young Man is Gone"" was still distorting in the same places but I think it's just part of the vinyl experience.  I listened to a 320 kpbs stream of the album over the same stereo system and I think for increased fidelity and consistency you get with digital, you for sure lose some of the power and realness the vinyl version gives.  So all in all, I think it's easy to nitpick on vinyl about some of the distortion, but the life, warmth, and realness I think make up for the tinny, by comparison, digital versions.  Also, it's not worth stressing so much over since I have not really improved the sound that much in the process."
vinyl,3da6jq,MrRom92,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:49:02 2015 UTC,"That'd the right attitude to have. Did you test the suspension like I suggested? No amount of aligning will help IGD if the cantilever isn't stiff enough.  I will stand by what I say though, that a properly set-up M97xe on a minty record (i.e. not already played w/ a mis-aligned cart) will yield wonderful results.   I got my replacement M97xe from Shure at the same time I procured an AT440MLa, which is considered one of the best trackers out there. Guess what… I use my M97 more! It sounds great with absolutely no noticeable IGD, and it tends to push imperfection pops and ticks into the background more even when loading it at 68k to bring the top up a bit."
vinyl,3da6jq,MrRom92,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:02:41 2015 UTC,"I'll check the suspension when I get back from work.    If it were defective, wouldn't I just need to replace the stylus?  I'd hate to send it back since I bought it 6 months ago.  Anyways, yes the IGD isn't there but I've read that ""s"" is very difficult to track at higher registers and with a low (in this case no) backing track. Since they doubled the parts, there are tons of ""s's"" in the song, and it's the second to last track, it's just statistically bound to distort at some point I guess.  With that said, the final track sounds great so I think that an a capella track in the second to last spot is probably going to cause some errors. Regardless, the song is beautifully sung and it sounds so in your face. So I think that's the tradeoff you get."
vinyl,3da6jq,LaserRanger,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:13:06 2015 UTC,"Check your suspension, because from what I've heard the quality control at Shure is kind of slacking, so it's quite possible your cart was bum from the start and I'm pretty sure a replacement stylus will cost over 2/3 what a new cartridge would cost. If you bought it six months ago you are still in Shure's warranty period (1 year, I think).   Literally all you have to is fill out and print a form from their website saying you can't get it to sound good, include a copy of your receipt showing the purchase date (an email printout works if you bought it online), package it all up and send it out. I asked them if I should send just the stylus or the whole cartridge assembly and they told me the latter. In a week's turnaround though they sent me back an entire new cartridge box, including the metal case shrink-wrapped and everything. So if you opt for this route, I'd send them the whole kit unless you want two of these things."
vinyl,3da6jq,AmadeusK482,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:30:27 2015 UTC,"Just go for the JICO SAS when you can - you'll be glad you did. It's a huge difference, although I do also have to question the quality of the stock stylus (or your alignment tools) - while it is typically unremarkable sounding, I don't find it suffers from sibilance or IGD except in extreme cases. And of course the SAS handles these significantly better, without any issue. If you are not confident in your abilities to align the stylus then the SAS may not be the best option for you, as proper alignment is absolutely critical with such a finely profiled diamond."
vinyl,3d8zck,sleepiestever,6,Tue Jul 14 13:00:55 2015 UTC,"That's cool, no worries, you'll be good.  The cheapest cleaning solution is Distilled Water ($1 for a gallon at your local supermarket), Isopropyl alcohol, and a drop of dish soap.  I'd imagine all you'd need is Distilled Water, given you have isopropyl in your medicine cabinet.    Mix 90-95% distilled water with 5-10% of alcohol (depending on the concentration, 91% - 5%, 70 - 10%, etc), and a drop of dish soap in a spray bottle and bam you've got yourself a record cleaning solution.  I suggest using a microfiber cloth to both clean and dry your record.  I wouldn't really know if using anything else would damage your record but this is what i've been doing and it's been great."

You are probably just seeing the oil streaking from your hand. You can add 90% alcohol at a 1:9 ratio of alcohol to water. and if that doesn't work add a drop or two of dawn (the kind they use to clean up animals that have been in an oil spill) and jet dry.

vinyl,3d8zck,bjgbob,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:11:40 2015 UTC,"Since others have addressed the cleaning, I'll go ahead and address the skipping.  It's unlikely that dust was the cause of your record skipping. Usually, record skipping happens either because the record is damaged (a gash, scuff, or crack, for example), or because the proper force isn't being applied to it. If the former isn't the case, you'll want to make sure that your tonearm is balanced and the appropriate tracking force is set (assuming you have a turntable with a counterweight on the tonearm). Besides combating skipping, this will also help ensure that your audio isn't being distorted and that your stylus and/or record aren't being damaged.  Doing this generally involves adjusting the tracking force dial to 0, then adjusting the counterweight so that the tonearm balances horizontally by itself. Then you should re-adjust the force dial to the appropriate force for your cartridge/stylus combination (which you can probably look up). You can probably find more specific instructions in your turntable's manual, which may or may not require you to do something differently. For example, my Dual has an anti-skating knob that I also have to adjust before and after I balance the tonearm.  One more thing: Make sure you let the record dry completely after cleaning it before you try to play it again! Wet records make an easy target for skipping."
vinyl,3d8zck,DeuceSK,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:48:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks!! I'll have to read the manual on that, haven't adjusted anything before.

Why would it be working for one and not another ? Hmm"
vinyl,3d9h65,rowmaxrow,2,Tue Jul 14 15:27:14 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter if a speaker is ""rated"" for more watts. That's shorthand for having an amp that is capable of proper drive and control for that speaker. However, in this case the 175W rating probably means that's its maximum power RMS. So in your case it just means you cannot (and should not) play them loud when paired with your STR-VX250. The difficulty might be in the 4 ohms rating. Your STR-VX250 only lists a value for 8 ohm power output (I checked a scanned manual online) so there's no telling if it is capable of driving speakers that go down to 4 ohms. But you could try; at low volumes likely the worst case is things will sound bad. Super worst case is the STR-VX250 doesn't have a protection circuit in it and you overload the amp because you turn up the volume and the AR speakers dip into 2 ohms or so for some frequencies. And reasonable amp that has a 4 ohm rating is fine. Old or new gear. I recommend the best speakers you can afford. :P Can you bring your STR-VX250 to the person who is selling the speakers to try the combo? Both should be replaced if you want to get better gear, but not because one or the other is a bad piece of gear."
vinyl,3d9h65,Josuah,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:09:47 2015 UTC,"the Acoustic Research speakers are really 4 ohm?  also, power and impedance are not at all the same thing.  in fact, they are independent."
vinyl,3d9h65,LaserRanger,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:55:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, as far as I can tell from the research I've been doing, they're 4 ohm speakers.  Also I'm completely lost with how to tell what can power what without anything catching fire, because the explanations I've found so far are either very technical or over simplified metaphors."
vinyl,3d9h65,Josuah,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:59:21 2015 UTC,"No, it's unlikely a cheap amp will double-down into 4 ohms."
vinyl,3d9h65,dorktwinkle,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:31:31 2015 UTC,A very non-technical summary: - Speaker wattage should be greater than amp wattage or you risk blowing out your speakers.  - Impedance/ohms ideally should be equal to each other. Its okay to run speaker ohms greater than amp ohms though. You should avoid running an 8 ohm amp into 4 ohm speakers or you risk blowing up the amp.

vinyl,3daoou,the_fanta,3,Tue Jul 14 20:25:11 2015 UTC,"I found a copy of ""I Love You"" by People! for 10 cents at my local thrift shop which I couldn't pass up, no matter how dirty and scratched. The surface noise was pretty terrible, outshining the music at times. I decided to try a homebrew cleaner I created of 1 part isopropyl alcohol and 1 part distilled water with a drop or 2 of dish detergent. I went over the surface of the record with the cleaner and then dried with a microfiber cloth. The record looked much cleaner (wish I had taken before and after shots) and after I was sure the record was dry, I put it on the turntable. I was not expecting to see any further results of the cleaning but the stylus seemed to act as a dirt pick, which was both shocking and disgusting. View at your own risk."
vinyl,3daoou,dethrock,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:25:41 2015 UTC,"Holy shit! ""Cleaning"" your record clearly didn't work the way you intended it to. You need to change up your homebrew solution if you're going to keep cleaning records this way. I'd recommend not having the alcohol/water ratio at 1:1. You also need a surfactant (a few options, I use jet dry) so that your solution will actually get into the grooves. I have an RCM, but here's what I use: Wash: 4 Cups distilled water, 1 cup 99% isopropyl alcohol, 1 tsp jet dry, 3-4 drops dish soap Rinse: 4 Cups distilled water, 1/2 teaspoon jet dry"

vinyl,3daoou,GothamCountySheriff,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:33:57 2015 UTC,"When you clean a .10 cent record by hand you can't expect miracles... Give the home-brew another shot, this time use different ratios like u/dethrock mentioned, then let them air dry. I've noticed that even after using my Spin-Clean I just ruin the point of using it if I dry my records with a microfiber towel which leaves tiny lint fibers behind. I always allow them to air dry in a room that isn't usually dusty, works every time.  Edit* Did you ""scrub"" the record with any type of brush? You can't just wipe the solution off and expect all that dirt and crud to disappear, it'll just go on the opposite side of the record."
vinyl,3daoou,dethrock,2,Tue Jul 14 20:39:16 2015 UTC,I forgot to mention that I went over it with a Mr. Clean Eraser after I dried it with the microfiber cloth.
vinyl,3daoou,GothamCountySheriff,3,Tue Jul 14 20:46:40 2015 UTC,"No matter what condition the record, the Mr. Clean eraser is only going to make it worse. If I were to guess, I would say the residue from your photos is a combination of the Mr. Clean eraser particles and dried dish soap.  When you clean your records, if you are using something like Dawn as a surfactant, you will need to thoroughly rinse your record to remove any detergent residue."
vinyl,3daoou,GothamCountySheriff,2,Tue Jul 14 21:06:49 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the suggestion on the rinse, which is a step I was missing. Your observation on the residue is most likely correct."
vinyl,3daoou,Kickatthedarkness,2,Tue Jul 14 21:12:45 2015 UTC,You went over the record with a Magic Eraser or you cleaned your stylus with it?
vinyl,3daoou,Slickrick1688,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:48:30 2015 UTC,"You went over the record with a Magic Eraser or you cleaned your stylus with it?    I did 1 pass around the record to pull out any dust and dirt left behind after drying with the microfiber cloth. I know the eraser is abrasive and is not something I would ever use on any of my records in my collection. As I said, this was a test on a 10 cent record."

While they're aren't the most accurate speakers, I do like the Bose 201/301 series for background listening, especially over extended periods. You may have already figured this out: your 301's are part of the Direct Reflecting series and make use of the walls in your listening space to give the sound a more natural and live feel (according to Bose). Facing the tweeter side of the speaker on a corner wall will allow them make use of this feature. You can check out the manual here:  http://www.manualslib.com/manual/217946/Bose-301-Series-Ii.html?page=2#manual"

My co-worker let me borrow his Infinity SL20 bookshelf speakers to get going. I can't wait to hear the difference in the Bose . . . that is if i don't botch the re-foaming job.
vinyl,3d55ia,GothamCountySheriff,3,Mon Jul 13 18:28:04 2015 UTC,"I was going to mention this, but forgot to in my reply. As you discovered, the foam surrounds in speakers deteriorates over time. Replacing the foam is not as daunting as it seems. It's a slow-and-steady wins the race kind of deal.   When replacing the foam, I've found the flat/angle side of a wooden cuticle stick works really well. Gently scrape the old foam off with the stick. Use some ISOPROPYL alcohol to carefully clean the remnants off the cone (very gently -- you don't want to rip the paper cone) and the basket.  Where did you get the foam kit from?"
vinyl,3d55ia,GothamCountySheriff,2,Mon Jul 13 18:46:24 2015 UTC,"got the foam kit from Amazon  So i've already done the foam removal . . . and did so before i read up on it. The removal on the outside went well . . . but as i was pulling off the foam from the cone i did manage to tear TINY bits of paper off of the surface while doing so . . . but the cone is in tact it didn't tear through . . . the edges are still together and it seems to be structurally sound . . . but i got a little sick to my stomach after i was done. The surface is still smooth and the ""damage"" really was minimal. I just hope i didn't destroy the speaker in my haste. I'll be sure to post the results after i've got the new surrounds in. Wish me luck."
vinyl,3d55ia,GothamCountySheriff,2,Mon Jul 13 18:56:56 2015 UTC,"If the amount of tearing is very small -- mostly just residual pieces on the very edge -- you should be fine. The replacement surround will cover a healthy margin in from the edge of the cone.  This audiokarma.org thread has some good info refoaming. You don't need to get into shimming unless all other methods fail. Somewhere around here, I have a 30-60hz tone alignment sound file, which works really well for keeping the voice coil aligned. You can hook up an iPhone/iPod to your stereo and play it on repeat to keep the voice coil centered while the surround dries. I'll try and find it again. If you don't hear back from me by the time you get around to gluing your surrounds, PM me and I'll send it to you.  Good luck!"

vinyl,3d8ovf,SodaCanSuperman,3,Tue Jul 14 11:07:04 2015 UTC,"I remember when speakers had those plugs, they were two pins, one larger flat pin, and one thinner and narrower than the other, and were called DIN 41529 loudspeaker connectors.  They were often used in cases where the speakers were bundled with the stereo itself, and where it was unlikely that the owner would ever care to upgrade them. So specifically it would be a lot easier for someone to plug the supplied speakers in than with bare wires / clips.  So you're just going to need something like this:  http://www.ebay.co.uk/bhp/2-pin-din-plug  You COULD just try shoving the bare wires into the holes, observing polarity consistency - though I'm not entirely sure how well it will work.   My very first turntable had them - which I was given as a gift from my parents in about 1977. It was a philips turntable and had its own built in amp - not unlike a crosley of today."

vinyl,3d8ovf,lemmehlemmeh,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:24:34 2015 UTC,"I found an old turntable with those plugs, the bare wires wouldn't fit in, so i added a thin nail at the end of the wire and shoved the thin nail in the plugs."

vinyl,3d8ovf,pete4pete,2,Tue Jul 14 15:11:31 2015 UTC,"oh i see. i think i understand what you'd 'like' to do - i.e., use one set of speakers with two amps.   well, you need a speaker switch.   if you've seen speakers with two sets of terminals on the back of them and wondered if they were for running two amps with them, it doesn't quite work like that.  (I won't get into how it works unless you want to because it can get quite complicated when we get into bi-wiring and bi-amping and it's all irrelevant to you at this moment)  The best thing I can suggest you do is keep your speakers hooked up to the amp as you have it today, and get a DIN to RCA cable, and plug it into TAPE on your record player.   What will happen now is your turntable will use its built in pre-amp to apply the RIAA curve, and spit out a line-level signal that you can then feed into any kind of line level RCA input on your amp - like AUX - but definitely NOT phono btw - that won't be line level.   If for some reason you need to use the amp you've currently got hooked up to your speakers, that's definitely the way forward."

vinyl,3d3a2o,rocknrollsteve,4,Mon Jul 13 05:12:42 2015 UTC,"That's a great question! I guess we will start with the Zeppelin albums. I've always really liked Zeppelin so I always pick up their albums when I find them cheap. I already have all of them in really nice shape but this copy of Presence is a lot nicer than the one I have so that one is an upgrade. I couldn't pass up getting the others though for $2! So I plan on maybe trading the other Zeppelin albums for ones I don't have like the first Zeppelin album.  Next Pink Floyd. It's been a real pain for me to get Pink Floyd albums here where I live. I find the repressings to be too expensive and when I go to the only record store they are always just as much and most of the time even more than the new pressing! So I was absolutely thrilled to finally get a good collection of Pink Floyd albums going! The only one of those that I already had was Dark Side of the Moon but this is a cover and record upgrade so I'll be keeping it.  Now Black Sabbath. I have always been intrigued by Black Sabbath. They are another pricey group around here where I live. The only album I have by them prior to purchasing these was Paranoid which I really liked so I figured I'd like to try some more stuff by them.  Last The Hendrix album. This is another one that I already have but this is a major condition upgrade. The one I already have is one my grandmother gave me but it is really really worn. My grandparents really played the crap out of it, so it is nice to have a better copy, though I will not be getting rid of the copy that they gave me. I cherish the records that my family gives to me. They are like family heirlooms and I want to pass them a long through the family for generations to come.   Thanks for the question!"

vinyl,3d6t9o,MrRom92,6,Tue Jul 14 00:00:54 2015 UTC,As a former HT employee I can confirm this is the reason. Vinyl/CDs are almost never a part of deals. They used to be a part of the whole store BOGO 50% off though... those were the days.
vinyl,3d6t9o,jcbowdenb4,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:54:41 2015 UTC,Oy.  I bought Manson's Born Villain just 'cuz it was 50% off on one of those sales.  That's about the time I learned it's not a deal if the record sucks.

Vinyl is not invincible, and you shouldn't just go throwing chemicals on it willy-nilly.  Lots of our regulars really like the Spin Clean system. Others use a mix of 10% isopropyl alcohol, 90% distilled water, and a drop or two of dish soap, followed by an epic round of distilled water rinsing. But to answer your question …   What's your go-to when you see a smudge on a record you're about to play?   A vacuum or professional cleaner. (Specifically a VPI 16.5 with Disc Doctor Miracle Record Cleaner and pads.) Sorry, but that's the answer. It just works better, and if you're in this for the long haul, you'll need to budget for one in the future.   Once the record's clean, I put it in a lined sleeve and the smudge problem doesn't come up again. For dust, a dry vintage Discwasher pad (NOT a new RCA one)."

vinyl,3d7trn,ScruffyandLovable,3,Tue Jul 14 04:43:39 2015 UTC,"The adjustment for the counterweight is two-part. The weight on the back of the tonearm sets the neutral or zero-balance (floating tonearm) and the control on the side adjusts the desired gram weight. To set the tonearm to neutral, you set the dial on the side to zero. Then release the set-screw for the weight at the end of the tonearm. Slide the weight until the tonearm floats horizontal. Screw the set-screw back in to hold the weight in place. Now put the tonearm back in the rest. Use the dial to set the appropriate gram weight for your cartridge/stylus.  I believe there should be an antiskate setting on there as well. You will want to set that to zero before balancing the tonearm and then set it to approximately the same as the gram weight for the stylus.  While not exactly the same, this video for adjusting the tonearm on a Dual should help you understand the concept for your Gerrard:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSDPINYQ72c"

vinyl,3d725i,Erbear8,2,Tue Jul 14 00:56:14 2015 UTC,First off. Yes. Rega RP1 is a great choice! Sounds great and works great. Lots of upgrade options down the line too!  For a Phono Stage I would recommend Schiit Mani. Sounds great and works well. It's also small and easy to hide if you need to. From there you would just need some powered speakers. Or some passive speakers and an amp.   For that I'm of less help because I already had some decent studio monitors laying around. JBL4326. I love my setup. I'm sure you'll love yours too.   Good luck!
vinyl,3d725i,Bootlegger1929,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:34:43 2015 UTC,"If buying new I would aim at Yamaha R-S201BL + Pioneer SP-BS22-LR. Otherwise you could link your local Craigslist so we can have a look. Slimline is a tough one, at that price you're looking at class-T amps, and to me they are not a great investment for anything apart from background music.  Edit: forgot that the US version is different to the Yamaha A-S201, as it does not have a phono stage. You may need to get a standalone phono stage as well."

vinyl,3d6835,chippewhattha,2,Tue Jul 14 19:04:54 2015 UTC,"Paper, aside from being made of wood pulp, can harbor mold, mildew, bugs, smoke, and assorted other crud. And let's face it, a lot of records, especially nowadays, come with a lot of stray dust and vinyl shavings inside the inner sleeve.   This isn't a new problem - I recall in the 1980s the American audiophile magazines were particularly irked with the amount of stray stuff in CBS inner sleeves. ""The Columbia Dirtbags"" they called 'em, and I can vouch firsthand that they weren't kidding.  If you're buying new and taking really good care of the records - being careful, storing them properly out of humid areas, keeping them in plastic outer sleeves, not smoking or vaping around them, and not mixing new record sleeves and covers with yellowing older ones - then you should be OK, assuming they didn't come in the 2015 equivalent of a ""Columbia Dirtbag"". But if you're buying used, then you should probably be using plastic or plastic-lined sleeves.  Again, I think there are higher priorities than this if you're on a budget, but if you're serious about being a record collector, you'll eventually need to deal with this."

I typically recommend the shure m97xe, which can currently be had for $69 new on amazon. It's a ""budget"" cart that sure doesn't perform like one, it's good enough to play with the big boys, and I've seen my fair share of people with that cart (and it's vintage v15 predecessors) mounted on multi-thousand dollar tonearms. Do you think you could stretch out your budget to accommodate that?

With the stylus the shure comes with, it's a bit of a step up over what you've currently got (if it had a stylus on it) but the great thing about it is that the stylus on it can be upgraded later in the future to something significantly better, if you ever wanted to make a step up later on - not a lot of carts have different types of interchangeable styli available like this. I have the feeling you'll be very pleased with it as-is though if you do choose to go with it. You're already doing significantly better than a lot of people manage to do with their first setups."

Almost every positive post says the same 3 things: great colors, great artwork, and they love getting new music.   Then genuine responses start about either: hey I liked the service but after a while I realized for what I pay I could find other new music OR this is a waste of money. Once those posts hit, the negative people get downvoted and the posting stops on that thread.   Too much of a pattern of me.

Art print nothing to write home about. Pressings aren't really limited either and VMP doesn't provide pressing count info.   Interesting idea but you'd do better to use their record of the month as a suggested listen and spend your money on stuff you know you want.  Just my two cents. they have selected good albums but it isn't worth the price. The free record I received from the buddy code was a mediocre bargain binner which zero people have on their want list."

The vinyl is  beautiful, the artwork is amazing and the customer service is speedy and friendly. They also do alot of giveaways on twitter and facebook.

vinyl,3d5dlo,Sirico,3,Mon Jul 13 17:34:56 2015 UTC,"I assume by the shrink wrap and the notch in the cover that that's an American cutout - meaning an unsold or returned record that was resold at a discount after being deleted from the catalog.  The hype stickers are original. The ""Records Are Your Best Entertainment"" one was usually used by record stores and distributors to cover up an out-of-date price sticker.

Found Frampton comes alive a few months ago and since then I've started spotting more of his stuff out in the wild. I stumbled on a charity shop I hadn't been into whilst out on a errand for work first thing I find is a Stevie wonder album awesome but only one record out of two, this was just behind it great condition and one awesome album!"

vinyl,3d67jo,MrRom92,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:46:25 2015 UTC,"Ive heard the Reds are harshly bright, and the Shures are really warm. If youre into that, go ahead, but I've also heard both cartridges still suffer from inner groove distortion and sibilance problems. If you stretch your budget about 100 dollars you can get the Audio Technica AT440MLa which most say reduces/gets rid of most inner groove distortion/sibilance issues."
vinyl,3d67jo,dftba171,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:05:49 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't really say that about the Red. To my ears, it was a fairly neutral cart. Not too bright and with a good low end. Pretty solid sound. Had a lot of sibilance/IGD problems with it though no matter what alignment or protractor I used. I don't know if the cart is just finicky or if I just couldn't get it right though.  I recently switched to an AT440MLa after about a year and a half with the Red and the difference is definitely noticeable. I find the 440 a tad bright and I'm still getting used to it, but it's worth it. Things are clear as they should be.  I would recommend OP looks at the OM 5e or the OM 10 though. I have a 5e on a Dual I use when I'm in school and the sound is really nice for the price point. I found it fairly easy to set up as well."
vinyl,3d67jo,daviduu,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:03:22 2015 UTC,I'd definitely choose an AT95e
vinyl,3d67jo,OregonFreeman,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:06:15 2015 UTC,"Sorry, forget to mention why. I bought the Lp120 turntable which comes with the at95e, I bought the Shure thinking it would be an upgrade, but it definitely was not. It sounded really muddy compared to the AT. It was like a threw a big blanket over my speakers. I took it to a hifi store to get it checked, everything was aligned perfectly. I couldn't listen to it, put the AT95E back on. Later on a friend let me borrow his Ortofon Red for a little bit. It was nice, but a barely noticeable upgrade, I would get the red if it was the same price as the AT but definitely wouldn't pay more for it."

After I got the record I heard they were doing signings so I went over and got it signed by the drummer, Brian Vigilone and the bassist, Brian Ritchie. I was especially happy to get the bassist's autograph becuase I feel like he diversifies the band from being a punk band to being something else. The way he plays changes the band entirely. I know they only had about 1 or 2 hits but I was happy to add this to my collection."

Day one I was able to get a Superman soundtrack but they were sold out of Aliens for the day. Day two some things came up but even though it took me three days at the con I finally got the Aliens OST.

vinyl,3d458i,beige4ever,4,Mon Jul 13 13:29:14 2015 UTC,Oh no our subreddit is really vitrolic.  I always try to be as nice and understanding when people ask if they made a bad decision for buying a cheap player.  I think crosleys are shit but i wouldnt say it like that to someone even if they asked my opinion because they'd just feel bad about it. The subreddit is pretty self contained though and can be easy to avoided.  Getting hate on your YouTube video is more personal and meant people went out of their way to find you and comment on the video.  Still wish everyone was nicer overall though.

vinyl,3d2mpg,germ22,45,Mon Jul 13 00:59:06 2015 UTC,"By upside down do you mean that the grooves are inverted?  These are either masters, plates or stampers. If the grooves match a vinyl record, then they are plates or masters. If the grooves are inverted and exposed, then they are stampers.  Basically when pressing, a machine cuts grooves into a metal disc that serves as the master. From there the master is coated in a thin layer of nickel, which produces the father plate. The father plate is then coated, which creates a mother plate.   In two step processes, the father is used as a stamper and the mother is stored for future plates. In a three step process, the mother is used to create multiple stampers and the father is stored to create new mothers.  A father can produce multiple mothers (something like 5 or 10 if I recall correctly). A mother can produce a similar amount of stampers. A stamper can produce between 500-1000 records, depending on the equipment used. This means one mother is capable of producing up to 5,000-10,000 records and one father 5-10x more than that. So the max amount of record you can get from a single master is somewhere between 25,000-100,000 (again, can't remember if the metal parts can produce 5 or 10 of each other).  If larger pressings are required, you'll need a new master plate cut. Even if cut from the same original audio source, this is considered a ""remastering"" which is often confused as the term is also often used with the audio source by remixing the levels of the audio.   Mind you, plates aren't kept for long and their quality can degrade so unless you are pressing such large quantities in a short time, chances are that you'll be cutting a new master for a repress years down the line. Hence why most labels take the opportunity to remix and remaster the audio at the same time.   Anyway... This is most likely a plate or stamper, depending on the orientation of the grooves. Are they worth anything? Maybe as a collectible only... I would certainly not listen to these unless you want to wreck your needle! But yea, if they are popular or rare recordings then I'm sure some collectors may want them.   Edit: I forgot to add that when you press a record you give the plant instructions on what to do with the metal parts after. You can have them sent to you with the vinyl, stored for X amount of time, or destroyed. By default most plants will store for 6-12 months in case you want to repress in that time. That being said, plates and stampers being out in the wild isn't unheard of since some labels may prefer to store them themselves after a press is done."
vinyl,3d2mpg,one800higgins,8,Mon Jul 13 02:09:33 2015 UTC,thank you very much for your detailed response. I guess these are stampers then since the grooves appear to inverted. Is there a way to play them and record them (for youtube) with out wrecking the needle?
vinyl,3d2mpg,mawnck,9,Mon Jul 13 02:29:53 2015 UTC,"I understand there are special ""forked"" needles used for that specific purpose. The result would come out backwards, and you'd need to use software to reverse it. But those labels belong to common records that can be had for considerably cheaper than such a needle can be had for. (The American pressings will be more common than the Canadian.)  I strongly suspect, however, that the labels don't reflect what's actually on the stampers. (Both LPs, for instance, have the same label but clearly aren't the same set of tracks.) Stampers wouldn't have labels on them anyway. Those were added later. You might need to do some discogs sleuthing of the master numbers scratched into the trailoff grooves to determine what's REALLY on those things.  TL;DR: They would have to have something absolutely spectacular on them for it to be worth it - and they almost certainly don't.  (EDIT: Can't sentence good tonight.)"

vinyl,3d2mpg,OutsideOwl,3,Mon Jul 13 07:32:30 2015 UTC,"I've never heard of any method to play a stamper. I don't see how it would be possible, honestly.   A record produces sound from a needle vibrating as it passes through the grooves. If you created a v-shaped device that played the exposed / inverted grooves, it would need to be able to expand and contract as it passed over the grooves. This would be incredibly complex, in my opinion, and would likely never sound the same as the record is intended to sound.   Edit: I see someone else already mentioned needles that do just this. I am now curious and need to look this up, hah."

As soon as I can find a functioning record player, I will post a video of them playing on youtube. Someone told me they are masters for pressing vinyls. Someone else told me, owning the masters makes me the owner of the music on it. (sounds cool, but seems outlandish).  I have tried to search on google, but you can imagine that metal records shows results of the metal music genre. I have found some info on aluminum records, but these here seem to be made of steel. The info on aluminum records said that they need to be played with soft needles, like from a cactus. do i need to do that on steel records? Are these records worth anything more than scrap value?

vinyl,3d2mpg,MrRom92,5,Mon Jul 13 01:02:45 2015 UTC,I doubt it makes you the owner of the music on it. Being able to copy a CD doesn't make you an owner of it either.

vinyl,3d2mpg,MrRom92,6,Mon Jul 13 16:00:33 2015 UTC,"What I can tell you about Quality Records is it was a licensing label that bought American records and released them in Canada.

And no, owning the physical master plates, or even actual master tapes does not mean you also own the recording contained on them (if this were the case I'd have quite a catalog)  So, it is what you thought it was - but it was also common for them, once discarded, to be used as parts of awards/plaques. So your gold/platinum/etc. record usually doesn't actually have the album on it - it's just old metalwork with a decorative label affixed to it. That would explain why these in particular have labels on them.   If you want to know what's really on them, try researching the inscriptions in the runout. They could be anything!"

HOWEVER, this is one of those things that SEEMS like a good idea but really isn't. Even though it does more or less fit, the 2M Red cart is engineered to work with a 2M Red stylus.

vinyl,3d4mvw,blerg34,2,Mon Jul 13 14:45:20 2015 UTC,"The thing about these packages is that they store them like this in the warehouse (you can see the barcode on the outside to identify it), then just slap a sticker on and send it out. Generally, this keeps them safe, but accidents happen.  I recently ordered something (interestingly enough, the last copy, so they may have been avoiding sending it or it was at the bottom of the pile). They throw the mailer into a huge box, leaving a note inside that said 'repackaged'. Shipping companies would have probably turned down the shipment, as they'd be blamed for the state of the package. Needless to say, it was totally destroyed.  Amazon paid for return shipping. Didn't have any more in stock, but I also realized that the US version of Sun Structures is crammed onto one record and not the version to get anyway."

vinyl,3d4mvw,blerg34,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:26:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, unlike many things on Amazon, often times the Prime records aren't really a great deal, they just essentially have the shipping built into the price.

vinyl,3d3hmx,mawnck,4,Tue Jul 14 01:58:18 2015 UTC,"My 3 cents (inflation and all that):   Are older (1970s and 1980s) inner sleeves ok if they are not obviously dirty?   Yes. I replace all mine, but this shouldn't be a top priority if you're hurting for funds. They've been putting records in paper sleeves for over a hundred years. You only really NEED to replace them if they're wrinkled or dirty.   It's always seemed to me that having the gap on the inner sleeve upwards makes the most sense.   This.   Do you clean new records as a matter of course when they arrive?   Yes, but I use a VPI 16.5. If you're using homebrew, I'd let this slide unless the record is still excessively noisy after a few passes.   Is there any risk in playing new records without cleaning them? E.g. does this risk grinding residues from production into the grooves?   No. The residues from production (if any) get scraped off by the stylus. No grinding. It's more of an oil than a solid. You should brush 'em off, though. I rarely see records that come out of the shrink dust-free.   Sometimes new records will exhibit a few pops. Are these likely to be pressing defects and un-cleanable, or dirt/residue/pressing scraps and cleanable?   These days it's hard to tell. Quality control is in the toilet. TBH, I don't buy many new records for precisely this reason. But yeah, new pressings can exhibit a LOT of surface noise if they're poorly made. You should hear budget-label releases from the 1960s - rice-krispies city right out of the shrink wrap, and not a thing you can do about it.   Do you brush your records before every playback?   Nope. Not unless there's visible dust, and I do my best to minimize that.   What brands do you rate?   A dry vintage Discwasher pad. (The new RCA-branded ones aren't the same thing and are practically useless.)   If a record sounds ok, is there any reason to wash it as a sort of 'regular maintenance' thing?   Absolutely not!!! Once you've cleaned them, the most you'd need to do is a dry brush to get the dust off, provided you've been handling them carefully. Exception: If you smoke, you're coating everything in the room with particles and gunk that will need to be cleaned off the records regularly. In fact, the main thing you're usually cleaning off used records is cigarette tar. Smoking used to be a LOT more common.   On the whole, do people consider washing noisy/dirty records to be worthwhile?   Good God, YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Is there a downside to using this type of device (Disco/Spin Clean)?   I can come up with lots of theoretical downsides, although I'm not familiar enough with those systems to say what they might actually be. Bottom line: If they're improving playback and you aren't seeing any physical damage, then you may consider them a good thing. My advice is to clean when required, and don't when not.   Cleaning fluid - is there a consensus on the best mix?   The ""best mix"" is to buy one of the expensive cleaners formulated by actual chemists who actually know what they're doing. That being said, your homebrew plan sounds adequate, but you need to add a surfactant - I recommend a few drops of dishwashing liquid. Rinse rinse rinse, and always use distilled, never tap!  I'll put in another plug for investing in a proper record cleaning machine (Nitty Gritty or VPI) and using the expensive fluid. Once you split the cost among hundreds of records, realize how much easier your life has gotten, and have heard the results, they don't seem so expensive! Use as directed.   lint free cloths … Isn't the risk of introducing new dirt/fibres much higher than any benefit?   Yes, I think so."
vinyl,3d3hmx,nameplace24,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:32:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks for such a detailed reply.  Interesting stuff.  I have purchased fancy cleaning fluid before, and I must say I thought it did a very poor job compared to my homebrew mix.  Reading a lot of forums, a lot of people swear by 90/10 water + isopropyl alcohol, some adding a drop of surfactant as you suggest, others not.   Once you split the cost among hundreds of records, realize how much easier your life has gotten, and have heard the results, they don't seem so expensive!   Maybe not to me, but you have to convince my SO!"

They're great - only problem is they occasionally don't fit nicely in older record covers for some bizarre reason.  I think newer covers must be slightly larger inside than older ones."
vinyl,3d3hmx,adayinalife,2,Tue Jul 14 02:00:21 2015 UTC,"My personal collection gets this attention from me.  When I get a record, I immediately put it inside an outer poly sleeve with the record inside the included inner paper sleeve that goes behind the outer paper sleeve.  I would buy better inners but that's too much money and I am in college at the moment.    When I get around to it, I wet clean every single record I have, regardless of being brand new or not with a solution of 90% distilled water, 10% 91% ispropyl alcohol and a drop of dish soap.  I grab an old tshirt and lay it down on my desk and then I grab two microfiber cloths to clean them, one to wet clean, and one to dry.  I generally try to wet clean before initial playback but it's not really necessary.    Pre-playback brushing, I use an audioquest carbon fiber brush and I brush my stylus with a very soft makeup brush [back to front] before playback, just to make sure there's no dust accumulating.    I've never heard of polishing records, whenever I clean my records [even OLD used ones], they are pretty shiny when I'm done cleaning them, so I don't see the need to polish them."
vinyl,3d3hmx,adayinalife,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:59:41 2015 UTC,"and a drop of dish soap   Out of interest:  Have you tried this without the soap and compared the results? And do you rinse again to get the soap off, or just not worry about it?  I am using just distilled water and alcohol, and I find the clean is good and I get zero static afterwards without the soap.  I worry that using the soap will gradually damage vinyl over its lifetime.   then I grab two microfiber cloths to clean them, one to wet clean, and one to dry   So literally just laying the record flat and rubbing it with a damp, and then dry cloth?"

I was doing my normal Sunday rounds and was caught off guard by a few records. This is a part of what I picked up. It includes:  Lincoln Street Exit-Drive it! (Reissue)  The White Stripes-The 2001 John Peel Show  T. Rex-Electric Warrior  Backstory:  Drive it!- The owner started talking to me about this record as soon as I walked in. He insisted we put it on and hear it and I thought it was pretty cool. After he ranted and raved about how much the original was worth he decided to give me this copy. I thought it was a pretty cool gesture although he did admit he really didn't like it all that much.  2001 John Peel Show-I'll admit that I'm not the biggest White Stripes fan but I thought this was interesting. I've done a little research on it but any information y'all have is appreciated!  Electric Warrior-My buddy at work has been talking about T.Rex since he got hired.

Once in awhile, I'd find a more or less complete Ani DiFranco collection in there. Since this was by the time that disc theft had been brought mostly under control (mostly through strict ID and consignment practices), and I only shopped in reputable shops, I knew that these were not stolen, but instead were part of the fallout from someone's breakup.  I found that vaguely amusing, in a whimsical way. Until it happened to me.  I won't go into the drama and heartbreak and all, only this one detail. I walked into a shop I'd been going to since I was in high school (this was now many years later), a shop best known for their extensive metal selection. I asked if they had any Ani DiFranco. They said they did, and it was pretty much the whole catalogue, but only one of each.  ""I'll take it."" And passed them my card. I walked out with a box of discs, about $200 lighter. And I know they knew."

vinyl,3czwsp,_ryanthompson,23,Sun Jul 12 08:20:07 2015 UTC,"tl;dr - I met Weird Al, he signed my record, pretty much the greatest thing ever  Weird Al Yankovic has been one of my artists since I was 8 years old, when a babysitter first played me Amish Paradise. Since that moment, I've been hooked on Al ever since. I've seen him in concert, I've watched his movie UHF countless times, and can recite the words to every one of his songs.  Last year, he released his 13th studio album ""Mandatory Fun"". It quickly became the number one album on the Billboard charts, marking not only the first time Weird Al has had a number one album, but the first time a comedy album had been at the top of the charts since the early 1960's. The new album had some his funniest songs in recent memory, parodying artists like Iggy Azalea, Lorde, and Pharrell. He's been able to stay relevant for the past 30 years through his ability to adapt with the times. His longevity has outlasted a majority of the musicians he lampoons.  His tour for this album, the Mandatory World Tour, was announced in January, and when I saw there was a VIP package that included a meet and greet with Al, I threw all monetary caution to the wind and picked up a ticket. For months all I could think about was meeting him. I'd seen him multiple times in concert, but never met or spoken to him. The thought of it just left me speechless.  May 31 was the day of the show. There was a preshow party that included costume contests, trivia, and free food. That was all well and good, I tried to enjoy myself, but I couldn't stop worrying about meeting him after the show. What would I say, would I pass out, would I make a dumb joke? The show comes and goes, and it's fantastic. The best show of his I'd seen yet. I'm sitting in my seat with my Mandatory Fun album (it was hard to pick which one to have him sign, as I have most of his stuff on vinyl). The VIPs line up, and we're told there is a one item signing limit, and it's the supplied tour poster. I get a little bummed, but I'm too nervous to really think about that.  Al comes in the room and sits at a table. It doesn't seem real. The line slowly starts to move, there are maybe 40 people, and I'm about 25 deep. As a approach, I start to weep tears of joy, a 26 year old tattooed man crying as he's about to meet Weird Al. I couldn't control it. I tried to regulate my breathing as I made my way towards him. Finally, it's my turn. ""Hi!"", Al says to me. I can barely get out a ""hello"" before I burst into tears again. I take a knee next to him, he asks if I'm going to be alright. I tell him that he's got me though some of the roughest times in my life, and thank him for everything. He was ""I truly appreciate it"" and gives me an unsolicited hug. He signs the poster and immedietly asks if he'd like me to sign the record for me, I stammer out yes please. We get a photo taken together, where I'm maybe the happiest I've ever been. I thank him one more time, and walk towards the door.  After I leave, I'm sitting on the steps of the theater, trying to process everything.

If you are thinking that the turntable alone is too expensive then you are probably over estimating what you can get om a budget that isn't going to butcher your records (as cheap decks can and will). Maybe do some research into the kind of setup you want and then ask advice,  it's too wide a question without an idea of the kind of where you're going with this.

It was named after a famous operatic soprano, Alma Gluck. It came with attachments to play both lateral and hill-and-dale grooves, referring to whether the vibrations were recorded side-to-side or up-and-down. (Lateral became the standard.)  Everything else I can find about it is behind a paywall, and nearly all of it seems to be old classified ads from someone trying to sell a used one. They must not have gone over real big. (And I also have to wonder if Mme. Gluck was consulted on the project, and if not, how she felt about it.) The dual attachment would've been expensive. Plus, only REAL audio snobs would have hill-and-dale records anyway, and they'd already have a genuine Edison Diamond Disc player to play them on. Diamond Discs and other hill-and-dale records were the Betamax of the acoustical era."

vinyl,3d2sew,DOMAN127,2,Mon Jul 13 05:23:47 2015 UTC,"All of the copies actually did have it; it was a problem with the pressing plates. Did you get it recently? They fixed the issue in a new pressing that looks identical to the 2012 one, except for the grooves."
vinyl,3d2sew,caitsith01,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:03:01 2015 UTC,"Well, to check I'm not going crazy, I just gave my copy a spin.  I bought it the second the box set came (I am a complete Pumpkins fanatic).  I assume you are referring to problems like this:  http://nowxspinning.tumblr.com/post/38861375566/review-3-smashing-pumpkins-mellon-collie   I restarted the song and the same distortion was happening. I let it play through and when I got to “Zero” it was immediately apparent that something was up.  The song was giving almost cut off level distortion through the whole track. You almost couldn’t hear the words; the solo was almost totally fuzzed out. It sounded TERRIBLE!!!    My copy absolutely, definitively does not have any such problem.  I just listened to Zero very carefully and it sounds vastly superior to the CD version due to the better mastering on the vinyl.  Again, this is definitely a 2012 reissue - I preordered it the second it was possible and counted down the days until it arrived.  I recall the issue at the time, and there were definitely others like me with no problems, and a lot of people complaining about very severe problems.    I would say that the most likely explanation is that several pressing runs were done, possibly for different markets, and on one of them something went really badly wrong with side A.    If you read the reviews here, you'll see I'm not alone - a lot of people had problems, but a lot didn't:  http://www.discogs.com/reviews?release=4082874&page=2  Edit: I also think some people complaining about that disc in those reviews possibly don't remember how distorted Zero is meant to be.  The end of the track is meant to be a screaming wall of distortion!  Corgan used, in some cases, dozens or even hundreds of guitar overdubs on MCIS.  But then at the very end, when BC sings ""she's my one and.... only"" that last ""only"" is perfectly undistorted again."

Make sure the tonearm moves freely in all directions (including up and down).  Make sure the cue lever works.  Check all auto functions -- start, stop, and make sure the tonearm picks up at the end of the record and returns to the arm rest and does NOT start over (according to the settings on the front; this one does have a repeat I think).  Check that both 33 and 45 are accurate and consistent.  Make sure the pitch adjuster works.  Find out what cart it has because you may be able to replace the stylus.  Otherwise, the AT95E is excellent."

The UA should ALWAYS be brown. And as noted elsewhere, that particular UA label was retired in the 1970s, and the company itself ceased being a going concern in the 1980s.  If it helps any, I notice that the label says it was pressed in England. (It doesn't look like it to me.)"
vinyl,3d07zp,mawnck,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:24:50 2015 UTC,Good point!  I didn't even notice that.  The logo is indeed black.  I just compared it to a genuine UA record I have and the colour on the Can album is definitely off.  That's pretty much convinced me it's a boot.  Cheers.
vinyl,3d07zp,summerisle2,4,Sun Jul 12 17:43:15 2015 UTC,So I just got this from ebay and I suspect it's a boot but I'm not sure.  Comparing it with photos of a UK first pressing there are a few things off with it.  The sleeve is non-embossed (I believe original Uk sleeves were?) and it's missing the DA/DA/73 text on the back cover.  The UA logo on the back cover is also missing some text regarding their adress.  The give away for me however is the fact that the matrix is handwritten (I've tried to take photos of this) and every original copy that I'm aware of has stamped matrices.  The label also has a ridge in it that I don't believe the original does.  I also know that there were some boots made on the UA label a few years ago and I think this may be one.  Before I return it though I want to be 100% sure that it's some obscure original pressing that hasn't been documented online anywhere (you never know...)  Anyone got any advice?
vinyl,3d07zp,rpbtz,2,Sun Jul 12 11:42:26 2015 UTC,How much did you pay for it? Yeah its one of those bootleg reproductions.
vinyl,3d07zp,casperthegoth,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:55:18 2015 UTC,Maybe try posting it to the Steve Hoffman forums. Those guys seem to know their pressings.  Was it supposed to be a UK first press?
vinyl,3d07zp,casperthegoth,2,Sun Jul 12 12:26:48 2015 UTC,"I'll do that, thanks.  The pressing wasn't specifically stated in the listing, but if it's a boot/reissue they should have made that clear.  Without seeing it close up myself, it just looked like an original from the photos on the listing."
vinyl,3d07zp,casperthegoth,2,Sun Jul 12 12:38:15 2015 UTC,"If they knew it was a bootleg, sure, but I think it is a little assumptive that people listing will be going through and ""should"" list if it a reissue - sometimes they are tough to identify.  one thing that you ""should"" do is ask questions if you need clarification, and pay reissue prices if it isn't a stated first."
vinyl,3d07zp,jonathandl,0,Sun Jul 12 15:23:27 2015 UTC,"Well actually I did ask what pressing it was.  He didn't give me a very clear answer though, he just gave me the catalogue number, which is the same as the original.    Personally, I think if you can't identify a reissue over an original you shouldn't be selling records on ebay.  It doesn't take 10 minutes to go through discogs and compare the record you're selling to the ones on discogs to establish the pressing.  In the long run, it save the buyer and the seller a lot of hassle."
vinyl,3d07zp,jimi_he,2,Sun Jul 12 16:25:50 2015 UTC,"It actually can take ten minutes - especially when you run into something complicated or with many pressings. Or you have something subtly different. Go ahead and tell me what pressing you got - if it is so easy? I'll tell you that assuming it is a boot because you can't find it on discogs is a horrible idea.  I understand that you asked and your answer wasn't clear. What isn't clear to me then is why you bid... and if you did bid, why you can't accept what you got.  I am sure this will get downvoted, but I don't really care because I think that if you are wanting a first pressing and it isn't clear your priority should be to NOT buy it. If you are accepting of what you will receive, then you can bid for it. I do think that ebay sellers have a responsibility to answer questions if they have the ability, but for a buyer to assume that a seller knows everything violates the whole idea of eBay as a place for common people to sell goods. Expertise is not required, and expecting it is arrogant."

The LP60 isn't a great turntable, and certainly not the best value. You can pick up cheap vintage technics or pioneers for $75 on Craigslist that definitely outclass that thing both in design and sound quality. However, its /not/ going to ruin your records any time soon. I wouldn't spin anything too expensive more than 3 or 4 times, but for beginners looking to get into vinyl who aren't necessarily interested in the quality circle jerk and just want to inwardly experience a physical music medium, it's really just mean and pointless to bash them constantly for simply owning one.

vinyl,3d1nha,dftba171,4,Sun Jul 12 20:05:35 2015 UTC,"Usually that indicates the lacquer wasn't dehorned before the plates were made. When the grooves are first cut, it can produce ridges around the groove edges. Those ridges are passed through to the pressings, and they can cause surface noise at first, and are prone to visual scuffs, but there's no long term effects.  Most plants won't dehorn unless they feel it absolutely necessary, since the process has its own perils that can negatively affect sound.  If you're seeing scuffs in the ungrooved areas, though, then you should be concerned - either with the paper sleeves or with dirt on the record's surface.  Also be cautioned … some plastic sleeves will do the same thing, and sometimes it indicates a bad reaction between the sleeve and the record.   Everyone please keep in mind … paper sleeves have been the worldwide industry standard since 1955 or so. They don't do that much damage if they're competently made, well cared-for, and unfolded. (I still replace them myself though.)  Most of y'all missed the fiasco in the mid 1980s when several labels started using biodegradeable plastic inner sleeves - that biodegraded all over the record."
vinyl,3d1nha,mawnck,2,Mon Jul 13 03:22:26 2015 UTC,"It can easily be due to the paper sleeves, they're just not good for your records. Also QC at at many pressing plants are not exactly impressive, so I believe some plants just don't care."
vinyl,3d1nha,rpbtz,2,Sun Jul 12 20:27:12 2015 UTC,It seems to me that newer paper scuffs records more readily.  Older paper jackets seem to be just fine for some reason.  Maybe they used better/softer paper.  They don't make em like they used to I guess.

However, I once lived in Canada, and whilst there dated a Canadian girl - and she had Screamadelica on CD - presumably a domestic Canadian release, and it had the Farley version in place of it.   Reading the wikipedia page, it says US CDs had this switch (so presumably that means North American) originally - i wonder if it was for sample clearance reasons?   Discogs suggests there never was a domestic North American issue on vinyl originally, only the Plain reissue in 2003. I bet it's exactly the same mix as on the UK version."

And throughout the rest of the year I continued to explore the hip-hop genre. Then my love of underground hip-hop led me to acts like Gorillaz and other acts associated with some rappers and started to listen to different and new music. Then, around the time of A$AP Rocky's new album, I began a curiousity in psychedelic culture and music. This led me to various posts on r/psychonaut and new music to listen to. I listened to DSOTHM firstly as my step dad is an avid Pink Floyd fan and was completely blown away by what I heard. I loved it. Then I listened to Wish You Were Here and moved onto other acts. The Beatles, King Crimson, Jimi Hendrix, Simon and Garfunkel, Tame Impala, Jefferson Airplane and others.

He's told me about this old local store where records were so cheap he could go and fill a shopping cart for something like $20. Shopping carts in a fucking record store. I'd bet that's where it come from but I should be seeing him tonight and I'll ask if he remembers. As far as the sound goes, I'm far from having an audiophile setup and it could just be because the record is so good, but it sounds excellent. Fairly beat old radio copy as you can see from the jacket but the vinyl itself is in really nice shape. I'll definitely keep my eyes out for another OG for you."

Once it's even with the gauge and squared up perfectly in the headshell, your alignment is set.  I bought one of these for my SL-1200 and it's a really useful little gadget.

vinyl,3cz60s,scabdick,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:55:01 2015 UTC,"When I first started collecting vinyl I kinda found 7"" singles pointless, mostly cuz it's already annoying to have to flip a full record over, but doing it after a single song seemed insane. Then one day at Goodwill there was a box filled with 45s, and I started digging and before I knew it I had like 15 of them, everything from American Pie to Alice Cooper to the Monster Mash. Since then I've been hooked. I'm always pretty stingy with the price of them, if it's just a single I rarely pay over $2 for them, but there's definitely more fun in just digging through them and finding cool stuff than there is in actually ordering them specifically online.

vinyl,3d0jv8,pds828,6,Sun Jul 12 14:31:58 2015 UTC,This is all far to specific to the band so I don't know. I have never been to a show where there is a designated autograph time. There is way to much going on for the band to waste that much time doing that. You're best bet is to find them well after the show when they are loading out

vinyl,3d0jv8,ledzeppelin341,4,Sun Jul 12 15:15:12 2015 UTC,"It's all random and depending on the band.   Some bands hang out with whoever's left at the venue a while after they finish playing (some do it before), some go straigth to their merch booth to sell and sign stuff, and some don't bother coming out to meet the audience at all. It's a gamble."
vinyl,3d0jv8,vinylfiend1219,2,Sun Jul 12 14:41:46 2015 UTC,Thanks.
vinyl,3d0jv8,JamesDeen99,7,Sun Jul 12 15:15:25 2015 UTC,"Honestly, in all my experiences meeting musicians, you should head to the back of the venue where the tour bus is. Security's gonna tell you the band left but it's their job to dishearten you so you leave but they're full of shit (you can see the tour bus, so you know they're still there), wait a little while for the band to put their shit away, and then, as soon as you see a band member you recognize, you wave to them and shout their name. If they're nice and like coming to see fans, which from my experience is most cases, they'll come over and see you and sign your stuff quickly before they leave. If not, they wave back to you and go off in their tour bus/van and drive off, which happened when I tried to meet Run the Jewels. (Hip-hop acts are much more difficult, but maybe I haven't tried meeting enough hip-hop musicians and they're not all that difficult to meet.)  Take it this way: They're gonna leave the same way they came in, so they'll be right at the loading area if they didn't already leave. Some artists do dip right after a show (hip-hop artists more often than rock musicians), so be quick.   I've met Adam Granduciel of the War on Drugs this way, as well as Laura Jane Grace of Against Me! (to name a few), and this was how I did it both times."
vinyl,3d0jv8,viceroy90,2,Sun Jul 12 15:51:14 2015 UTC,"Shit, I met Laura Jane Grace twice in one day. Once at Record Archive in Rochester, then before the show."
vinyl,3d0jv8,JamesDeen99,2,Sun Jul 12 16:15:34 2015 UTC,"Completely agree with this. I met Jack Tatum (Wild Nothing) this way. If you go to the back of the venue where the band is loading their tour bus at the end of the show there is a good shot of you meeting the band. There may be security there luckily for me there wasn't just Jack's manager who was really nice. I talked to him for a good 10 minutes about his music and got a pic with him.   Meeting the band after the show really is a gamble, it depends on a lot of things, how big the venue is, the smaller the venue the greater the chance of meeting the band, and sometimes just pure luck. Bring a Sharpie if you want to get your albums signed."
vinyl,3d0jv8,viceroy90,3,Sun Jul 12 16:16:25 2015 UTC,"I always try to get stuff singed by bands I see. My advice is to go early and stay late.

vinyl,3d0jv8,snowskifart,3,Sun Jul 12 16:14:35 2015 UTC,"Mac was walking around (small venue) Lots of people were running up and taking selfies. I had a poster i had just bought so I got him to sign it and take a quick pic. Then i bought him a pabst and we took a long drink and he said ""thanks brah!"" and went backstage. Courtney was opening for Belle and Sebastian. After her set, I went over to her merch table and asked the dude working if it was possible to get her to sign the album and he said sure! When B&S were playing she came out and seemed surprised someone actually waned to meet her and once other people saw her, she singed more things. She signed the album and we talked about music (I had a Bob Dylan shirt on and she liked it)."

I mostly listen to rock and folk and more modern styles of music, but I collected a lot of jazz because I love jazz on vinyl. Also, I'm minoring in music and that has probably influenced some of the classical music choices I've made.  Sorry if some of the descriptions on the albums are terse, I wrote it all out nicely and then it didn't get saved right after I finished, so I had to rewrite it, and it's getting late so I just went more quickly.

One of the first albums I saw was this one, Drones by Muse, and I knew I would not be able to leave without it. I have always thought Muse were good but it was not until the other week I saw them live, at Bråvalla festival, and I was completely blown away. Especially by the track they started with, Psycho, which is the second track on the album. I'm usually into metal and such so a heavy track like that easily got my attention.

vinyl,3d10y1,jackubt,2,Sun Jul 12 22:37:53 2015 UTC,"Vintage is definitely the way forward.  I paid £90 for my turntable and amp then swapped out the cartridge. Look for nearby items on Ebay would be my suggestion as to avoid hefty shipping costs, the dangers of shipping turntables and it allows you to check out the table first and maybe get a demo as well."

They should have fixed it and sent an updated side a/b to every poor bastard that bought the damn thing.  On a related note, what'll ya take for that one, OP?"

I played it a bit, but I already had it on casette and CD so I didn't play it that heavily.  Fast forward 15 years ago and I'd forgotten all about it until a thread on perfect 10 albums, and another user commented they'd paid nearly $600 for the same pressing. I had a quick rummage in the garage, and there it is - still in near perfect condition, still beautiful  Edit: added some more photos after a couple of complaints about the shifty picture / low effort.

I have a soldering station but I've mostly used it for smaller projects; I was planning on maybe recapping my current receiver for fun this summer to get some experience on that end."
vinyl,3cvyiw,Khemikooligan,2,Sat Jul 11 06:20:50 2015 UTC,"So far, everything I've done from Bottlehead has been pretty easy.  Their manuals are excellent.  As long as you can follow instructions, you'll be fine.  The Crack is a great introduction.  Nice and simple, and not too crowded.  Some kits have a lot of parts, so maneuvering the soldering iron gets a bit tricky."

It has the Integration upgrade and a pair of Amperex Bugle Boy ECC88 tubes.  Digital side is an Apple TV and a Schiit Modi 2 Uber DAC.  All of that goes into a new Bottlehead Stereomour II integrated amplifier.  Speakers are Tekton Design Lore-M's.

vinyl,3cy52f,Loud_Vinyl_Disks,2,Sat Jul 11 23:35:38 2015 UTC,Are you sure the stylus is no good. You could try one of your dads records an see if it plays okay.   If necessary you can get a fairly cheap replacement cartridge or stylus. The changer can be used till something better comes along. My SO suggested we get a changer for the bedroom system so one of us doesn't have to get out of bed every 20 minutes while the TT is going.  If used properly the risk of damage to the LP is fairly low. Most damage happened on these units to the label around the spindle hole. It's possible that manually placing the stylus on the record poses more of a risk due to user error than the TT doing it automatically.   Changers were the standard for many years to the extent that double albums were manufactured with sides 1 & 4 and 2 & 3 on separate records so you could play sides 1 & 2 and flip them both over on the changer to play sides 3 & 4 in order.  You are more likely to experience speed problems than anti-skate problems with a deck like this. You should try it out and see if it works as is. You can't beat free.

vinyl,3cx55y,topsyandpip56,3,Sat Jul 11 15:39:22 2015 UTC,"Looks good from here, although it's the cantilever that's most important, not the plastic.   Technics didn't intend for you to use Baerwald, so the screw holes in the Technics headshells aren't exactly optimal. There's an official overhang gauge available that you can use to align the cart to Technics standards. (EDIT - that link doesn't work quite as intended, at least on my browser. It's the ""Technics Overhang Gauge"" about 3/5 of the way down, or click on ""alignment tool"" in the HEADSHELLS column.)  Also try tweaking your VTA (the big dial around the tonearm base - there's a lock toward the back that may need to be disengaged). Theoretically the cart and headshell should be level, but a little tweak one way or the other may be necessary for best sound. Also make sure the stylus is clean, the VTF and anti-skate are dialed in, yada yada yada.  If your collection has been played a lot on inferior equipment, then the IGD might unfortunately be ""burned in"". Was there a Crosley or LP60 in this collection's past by any chance?"
vinyl,3cx55y,mawnck,2,Sat Jul 11 16:27:16 2015 UTC,"As usual, /u/mawnck nails it. Too often people are aligning trying to eye up the body of the cartridge, and that doesn't take into account any deflection of the cantilever when it is actually on the grid, or how the diamond was actually mounted on it. Stevenson is also designed to give lower distortion in an LP playing area in relation to baerwald, which was developed when the 78 RPM disc was king. Entirely different animals.   Also good point about the distortion being ""burned in"" to the record. That's groove wear, and that's why we strongly warn against the cheaply made groove-chewers. Once it's worn, really not much of anything that could be done beyond replacing the actual record.   I think your best course of action is to re-check the alignment eyeing the actual stylus itself, and then play testing a known good record."
vinyl,3cx55y,MrRom92,2,Sat Jul 11 17:24:24 2015 UTC,"I did line up according to cantilever, I was just unable to get an image of the cantilever relative to the grid lines (camera is too thick).   It was actually a brand-new pressing of an album with IGD that finally made me create this post - so I don't think groove wear is at play, at least here.   I have gone ahead and ordered an overhang guage, then I'll give the Stevenson alignment a go and see if that makes any difference. I'll test the same album too, when I get that all going. Thanks!"
vinyl,3cx55y,MrRom92,2,Sat Jul 11 19:01:41 2015 UTC,"No problem! It's good that you seem to have a better idea of what you are doing. I do agree that the 440mla, even though I'm not a huge fan of that cart in particular - it should be able to handle inner grooves with ease and eliminate the IGD. That's kindof it's schtick and is certainly designed to handle that well. Hopefully the alternate alignment will work out better for you."
vinyl,3cx55y,mawnck,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:57:23 2015 UTC,"Well, I've gone ahead and ordered an overhang gauge (though from eBay, as the linked one is about 4000 miles away), and I'll probably give Stevenson a try as someone else suggested. I would love to correct my VTA, but my entire VTA adjustment wheel is completely buggered. The previous owner of this deck forced it too far, and it's stuck completely. I tried to fix it myself in the past but I proved completely useless at doing it...  This collection hasn't really been played on equipment too shoddy - the previous deck used was a Tensai 855D with the generic pre-aligned spherical cart. Thanks!"
vinyl,3cx55y,mawnck,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:58:48 2015 UTC,"it's stuck completely   That's actually very not good with a microline stylus. That may be what's causing your IGD. You NEED to get that straightened out. (Again, are you sure the lock isn't switched on? It's a little silver lever thing.)   spherical cart   Ooh … that might also be the cause of the IGD. Spherical styli aren't kind to inner grooves (relatively speaking) and the AT440 is plenty good enough to pick up the damage, if any. Try a post-Tensai acquisition and see if it does it.   EDIT - Oh, I see you already did. Sometimes IGD can also be caused by sloppy cutting. But I think the VTA is your most likely culprit. Either that or you just got a bum stylus. It happens."
vinyl,3cx55y,LaserRanger,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:19:41 2015 UTC,"Fixing the VTA may be easier said than done. Not only is it seized, it's also been forced too far (again, blame the previous owner). I'll give it a go with some contact cleaner during the week but I don't expect too much.  It honestly wouldn't surprise me if the spherical cart had done damage, I just hope it hasn't done too much damage..."
vinyl,3cx55y,LaserRanger,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:15:36 2015 UTC,"Just to re-emphasize … You MUST do it. Running a microline stylus with incorrect VTA is BAD. We're literally talking Crosley-level damage here.  As I always do when someone is having Technics problems, I encourage you to contact the guy who runs http://kabusa.com and see what he suggests. It might be an easier fix than you think. And if it requires parts, he'll have 'em."

My brother lives in Harrisonburg and got a Technics that wasn't too shabby from one of the shops in that area, but otherwise there are often Turntables popping up on NOVA's and the RVA craigslist depending on where you're from. Another option if you're in Blacksburg is to check the YMCA thrift store on North Main as they get some good audio gear throughout the year, I was in there a week or two ago and they had some okay stuff however they try to bundle their audio gear as package deals though the price is still more reasonable than the $300 plus you'd spend on a ProJect. Another option is to check out John's Camera Corner by Squires as he has some nice vintage stuff too which is in your price range though not as cheap as you'd find roaming thrift stores.   Generally the Guidelines you'll want when buying is something with an adjustable counter weight on the back of the tonearm and an antiskating feature which is usually just a dial next to the tonearm labeled as such. A tonearm with a P-mount Headshell is doable though one with a standard mount is preferred. The only other thing I can think of is to make sure that the thing spins and spins at the correct speed and that the cueing lever works, though it's not that big of a deal if it doesn't."

This is about the maximum that a poor college student like me can muster together but it works and sounds just fine to me.  Pretty standard Audio Technica AT-LP60 I picked up from amazon, fed through a cheap set of Logitech Speakers with a LR to 3.5mm converter. The sound actually isn't all that bad, the speakers sound better playing vinyls than they ever did plugged into my pc.  My collection is just starting out, it's a little over 20 LPs and a handful of 45 singles. The collection is mostly made up of  small time Pop Punk, Hardcore, and Punk Rock bands that I was really into in high school. The oldest vinyl I own is what I believe to be an original pressing of Quadrophenia by The Who.  On deck right now is Hyperview, the latest album from post hardcore/ shoegaze band Title Fight, which I highly recommend. Give their single Chlorine a try and you'll have a good feeling for what their last two albums sound like, going farther back is more post-hardcore/ pop punk territory.

vinyl,3cuzq2,aznalex,6,Sun Jul 12 02:34:49 2015 UTC,"No. Avoid the LP60. It is crap. Here's my experiences with Hanpin's cheap belt drive line (which includes the LP60):   I had two (actually 3, one I got for free that never worked) variants of Hanpin's belt drive line that includes the Audio Technica LP60, Pioneer PL-990, Sony PS-LX300USB, Denon DP-29F, and several others. They're all the same unit, with cosmetic differences, USB connectivity (or not), and the Pioneer has pitch control.  The first I owned was a Sony PS-LX250H, which I used from sometime in 2001/2002 to Christmas 2007. Funny thing was I went through 2 that had broken styli out of the package...unfortunately the third had a working stylus. Otherwise my father was going to look elsewhere for a turntable. It ended up crapping out in 2007. As soon as the stylus set down on the record, it lifted up and went back to rest. So I tossed it out and asked for another turntable for Christmas.  Which is when I received an Audio Technica PL50. The PL50 was given USB output and rebranded as the LP2D-USB, then given a cosmetic makeover and is now the LP60. I used that until early 2013. With both the Sony and Audio Technica I experienced tons of skipping, even with brand new records. It was a huge turn off to vinyl, and I didn't have high expectations of it. I didn't take it as a serious music format because of this. I still listened to records on a regular basis, but nowhere as much as I do now.  During my senior year of college I started becoming interested in hi-fi audio. After reading stuff on here and other forums, I found out that the PL50 was junk and the source of skipping and accelerated record wear. I didn't understand anything about vinyl other than the very basics, so I did some research and bought a vintage Sanyo for $20. I was shocked at how much better it was than the Sony and Audio Technica, and kicked myself for not upgrading sooner. I would have upgraded immediately had I known that skipping was not a fault I had to live with. And audio quality was far better.  It was a night and day difference. I stopped using the PL50 immediately. Eventually I'll learn to forgive myself for wasting over a decade of my life on crappy turntables. I take vinyl as a serious format nowadays and buy way more records as well.  It's funny, the impact of using a decent turntable has had on my life. Last night I had a girl over, and she being a music geek (like myself) checked out my record collection. She immediately asked me if I had any Rolling Stones, and I pointed her to their records I owned. She was ecstatic to pull out a copy of their first US LP. I distinctly remember this was a culprit of egregious skipping on my PL50, which turned me off from ever listening to it again. Played it on my $15 Dual last night and not a single skip. That would have been a huge turn off had I played it on the PL50!   Edit: formatting"
vinyl,3cuzq2,lpmiller,-3,Sat Jul 11 14:50:11 2015 UTC,"I would definitely recommend it, it's a solid belt driven table for the price. Just realize that it's pretty light on features, it just plays records.  Also a few points about it, the tone arm is relatively light, so you might want to do the penny trick unless that's frowned upon now. The lightness of the arm is good because, unlike cheap crossley players, it won't carve out your records over time. The heavy crossley arms cut into the vinyl very slowly but eventually making them unplayable. I'm talking years down the line and dozens of plays for diminished quality but YMMV.  The lightness is problematic because it makes the player very sensitive. It originally sat on one of those folding plastic tables you get from costco, and dropping anything heavier than a pencil even lightly on the table would make it skip. Now it sets on the tempered glass table and is more vibration resistant, also I'll be going with /u/3__ 's suggestion of a marble bass plate to pull better tone from the player.  It comes with standard stereo cables, but ships with two converter sets so you can use pc speakers like me or plug it into other speaker setups, so you can start with affordable options and move up from there.  Tl;Dr: It's a great starter for the price, recommend putting on a shelf or something dense to cut down on skipping, watch out for light tone arm.  ALSO, I recommend grabbing one of those audioquest carbon fiber record cleaners you can see in the album, it pulls dust right off records, for heavily dusted records, I'd say go for titebond type II wood glue, but be careful, you can damage the record. Check my post history for an example. I need to replace my IKSSE:3 vinyl because I messed it up."
vinyl,3cuzq2,aznalex,6,Sat Jul 11 03:16:06 2015 UTC,Penny on headshell creates the same problem as Crosley arms.  Don't do that.
vinyl,3cuzq2,happydayz94,4,Sat Jul 11 14:13:01 2015 UTC,"so you might want to do the penny trick unless that's frowned upon now   This has never been a good idea. People used to do it back in the day because they didn't know any better. Skipping is not a fault of vinyl you need to live with, nor does it require you to weigh down the stylus past the recommend tracking force (which will accelerate record and stylus wear as well as collapse the suspension on the stylus)."

vinyl,3cvmb8,TheOnlyBongo,3,Sat Jul 11 03:43:24 2015 UTC,"78 styli are available for some Crosleys (Note: That may or may not be the exact one you need). I'd URGE you to get one to tide you over until you upgrade the TT. Playing 78s with the stock stylus is bad. (And you'll be delighted with how much better the records sound with the proper stylus!)  I concur with Mr. Rom that the LP120 is your next move. The cart it comes with - the AT95e - has 78 styli available.  A few other random pieces of advice:  Cleaning advice: Shellac dissolves in alcohol! And you should not use an immersive method like a Spin Clean on 78s, since some have paper cores and can be messed up badly by soaking in water. (Some of the wartime shellac compounds, like that used by US Decca, dissolve in water too!)  Most 78s will have too much bass and not enough treble on a normal setup, because the RIAA EQ wasn't standardized until 1953, and it was optimized for LPs. An equalizer (or at least an amp with a tone control) will give you more accurate sound. If you're really serious about 78s, you'll eventually want something like a Rek-O-Kut Re-Equalizer to solve this problem. (Not cheap.)  Nothing improves the sound of 78s more than mixing to mono. You can't do it with a Crosley, but your eventual setup should have a way to mix the two stereo channels down to one. The super-cheap (but quite effective) way to do it is with a double-Y adapter, which uses two inexpensive Radio Shack adapters to combine the two stereo channels and then split them again. Using one of these cuts WAY back on the surface noise on all mono records - which is extra-important on shellac!"

A waaaaaaay more lax, and also fun (and occasionally very drama filled) 78 group is 78 RPM Professor Quimby's Sickness/Compulsory Laboratory. It actually started off as a split from the Fan group due to some very enjoyable drama.  Honestly if you wanna watch old people fight about 78 records these two groups are your best bet.

vinyl,3cvmb8,MrRom92,2,Sun Jul 12 00:26:28 2015 UTC,You won't do better than 78s for the songs from that era. Just remember that you need a standard groove stylus!
vinyl,3cvmb8,MrRom92,2,Sat Jul 11 06:32:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, I absolutely do need a special stylus to properly play my records! Along with that, a new turntable too. Still clinging onto the old all-in-one I got as a gift. I hope to find a decently priced turntable that can also play 78's as well as have the cartridge needle and an auxiliary plug in so I can record and digitally store my finds."
vinyl,3cvmb8,MrRom92,3,Sat Jul 11 06:37:14 2015 UTC,"If you're looking at a new option, something like the audio technica lp120 would suit you well with 3 speeds and the ability to hotswap headshells (you can have a 78 cart mounted on an alternate headshell for ease of use with both LPs and 78s this way)  I'm fairly positive it has USB also but I wouldn't worry about that aspect too much, pretty much turntable has the provisions to be hooked up and digitized - usually with better quality than you'll get from the built in USB ADC anyhow."
vinyl,3cvmb8,MrRom92,2,Sat Jul 11 06:45:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the recommendation. I was certainly looking at the Audio Technica line as well as a few others. I took a quick look at their website and sites like Amazon. Fairly inexpensive and looks pretty nice as well. Have you used their products before? If so, can you explain the cartridge head in a TL;DR fashion? I thought it would be simple like a 'Microgroove Cartridge' or a '78 Needle' or something. Instead on their product page i am seeing a whole ton of cartridges with varying prices and names and the styli I have absolutely no clue. Any recommendations on those as well?"
vinyl,3cvmb8,jesusfromthebible,2,Sat Jul 11 06:57:49 2015 UTC,"Keeping it simple - the cartridge houses the stylus assembly (cantilever, suspension, and a diamond tip) which make contact with the disc, and it also houses the components which generate the electric signal based off it's ""reading"" of the disc - this electric signal is later amplified and passed out your speakers and boom, you've got music.   As for what cartridges to use - Microgroove, what it comes with out of the box is nothing special but it's still a huge upgrade from what you're using now so I wouldn't worry about it immediately. For a 78 cart, the Shure m78s is inexpensive and does an adequate job if all you're worried about is listening to these tunes! Archival use may call for something a little more high end and would allow for a variety of different styli to get the most out of different discs (78s were not very standardized until fairly late in the game) but again, that cart will be more than suitable for your use.  The reason you need a different cart (or at least a stylus) for 78s is because the groove width is entirely different. They will not play back properly on a microgroove stylus, in fact there is a high potential for both the stylus and record to get damaged this way."
vinyl,3cvmb8,daviduu,2,Sat Jul 11 07:10:10 2015 UTC,"Alright then, I got that information down. Since I would be getting an Audio Technica turntable, it would make sense to get some Audio Technica cartridges and styli, right?  http://www.audio-technica.com/cgi-bin/product_search/cartridges/cartridges.pl?lang=eng  http://www.audio-technica.com/cms/site/3a349167418cfb7c/index.html  This is where I got completely lost in my selection. Cartridges of varying cost and styli of different gauges. I've only started the hobby and it's just begun to make my head spin haha. Or are other cartridges/needles interchangeable with differentiating turntables?"
vinyl,3cvmb8,mawnck,2,Sat Jul 11 07:24:17 2015 UTC,"Modern cartridges typically come in one of 2 major varieties regardless of manufacturer - your standard 1/2"" mount, or the p-mount style (this one is now considered obsolete and no turntables which accept it are manufactured anymore)  Some people will likely reccomend the AT440MLA out of their offerings, personally I don't like the performance of any of the AT cartridges and typically don't recommend them. I think there are better options for less money.   Again, nothing to worry about at first since the cartridge it comes with out of the box is already a significant step up from the ceramic piece of junk your Crosley used to plow into your discs with.   Audio technica does not manufacture a stylus intended for 78rpm discs to my knowledge and I do not see one anywhere on that page either. I'm sure if they did it wouldn't be a very good one anyhow :P"
vinyl,3cvmb8,Chester_the_cat,2,Sat Jul 11 09:59:28 2015 UTC,"Man you've been a seriously big help to me. Getting into such an expansive hobby can be very mind numbing to a newbie like myself, so thanks! I'll certainly put a lot of consideration towards getting an AT LP120 that's for sure. Relatively inexpensive but at the same time still better than my cheap turntable AND should be able to convert my stuff from shellac to .mp3. If you had to give a recommendation to a company for cartridges and styli, who would it be?"
vinyl,3cvmb8,mawnck,2,Sat Jul 11 10:26:32 2015 UTC,"That's what we're here for man!   For microgroove - I typically reccomend the shure m97xe, on its own it is usually a slight step up (or at least sideways) from what most people start out with. BUT - there is a Japanese company, JICO, who manufacture an upgraded aftermarket ""SAS"" stylus (about $200) for this cartridge which really transforms it into something many steps above of it's pricetag. Truly stellar performance. I think it's good that people have the option to make the first upgrade to just the new cart, and then ""complete"" it later on once they feel they are ready to go all-in.  I will mention this now, I firmly believe the cartridge and stylus have the absolute most influence over the quality of reproduction - if you're looking to change things up and get better sound, that would be the number one component to look at.  For standard groove - the shure m78s is a great inexpensive option. While there are dozens if not hundreds of different phono carts being manufactured today, there really aren't many for 78 playback since it is a bit of a specialty, definitely a niche within a niche… within a niche. A very small percentage of people into records even have the capability of spinning them at speed let alone worrying what stylus to play them with. There are maybe 5 different manufacturers on the market with options for 78 playback, if even that? Not a lot.   Oh yeah, speaking of speed, I just remembered this - the Lp120 does feature a pitch adjustment knob, which will be majorly beneficial to you as the actual 78rpm speed was not standardized well into the 1920s. So ""78s"" could actually be all over the map, maybe 69, maybe 90. Although generally speaking, they mostly fell between 73-80 rpm. You could see how pitch control is a necessity for 78 collectors though. You might not have to worry about this if you strictly stick to songs from the 30's-50's, but even that is relatively late into the era of 78s. Once you have a disc that requires that flexibility out of your turntable, you'll be glad you have it."

Also, ""Import"" is a highly abused term these days. There's really no reason for it to cost more because it's ""imported."" Music on Vinyl is a huge operation so they make all their shit in China anyways. We also live in a highly globalized economy, so ""imported"" doesn't mean what it use to mean. It's just another way labels/stores squeeze a couple extra bucks out of you."

That being said, I personally get a little annoyed with the way MOV prices their reissues as if they were an audiophile label like Mobile Fidelity or Analogue Productions. I actually don't have a problem paying $40 for Mobile Fidelity's Freewheelin' reissue because they half-speed mastered it from the original analog tapes... and it just might be the best sounding record I've ever heard. I can appreciate that MOV sometimes reissues titles that are out of print, but sometimes I'll find the same title in my local store - $35 from MOV, $18 from 4MWB, with originals selling on discogs for around $15."

As already pointed out buying MOV releases in the US will be more expensive as they are imports, just how MoFi releases are more expensive for Europeans to buy for the same reasons. Also I don't believe it's fair to compare MOV to 4MWB. MOV have a pretty decent reputation in terms of quality, 4MWB not so much. Just my thoughts, though.  In the US you will be paying extra for import costs with MOV and extra for a high-qualtiy product for MoFi, with the assumption that their prices are more or less similar in the US."

Just my thoughts, though.   You might prefer MOV over 4MWB (I know I do), but comparing the two is not unfair. At the end of the day, they are both reissue labels capitalizing on the current vinyl resurgence, and they both use digital sources. MOV has a better track record when it comes to QC, but they're not perfect, and IMO, they're not on par with Mofi or labels of that tier (Pure Pleasure, Speakers Corner, Analogue Productions, etc). I've had to ship MOV records back to European sellers from the US because of obvious visual defects, right out of the shrink wrap."

Bummed to hear that you've got some poor records from MOV as that have yet to happen to me.   they're not on par with Mofi or labels of that tier    I agree. I didn't mean to do a quality comparison. I was merely stating that MOV is expensive in the US because of import prices, while MoFi (and the like) is expensive because of a high-quality product. MoFi releases are similarly expensive in Europe, because they're imports over here. Not uncommon to see them here for $60 new."

Two thirds of the record stores that were open in my city in 2003 have closed by now.  Expecting Amazon like bargains from the remaining stores is the perfect way to crowd out the rest of them.
vinyl,3czdnb,rastafireman,-7,Sun Jul 12 04:36:24 2015 UTC,"If you're going to argue ""demand supports these prices"" and then ""the internet is killing my local record store"" in the same breath, you're missing the point.   I think the labels and the record stores are both engaged in price gouging. The record stores should be pushing back on labels/distributors to provide inventory at a more reasonable price. They shouldn't be buying over priced reissues and supporting the prices to keep rising and rising. If demand is high, why not increase supply? Because both entities care more creating HUGE margins through artificially constrained supply.   But if that's how they want to play the ""libertarian free-market forever"" game, then they shouldn't complain that I can literally find anything cheaper on discogs or ebay. When I see this kind of price gouging at record store, I've lost all respect. They can close for all I care."

When people refuse to pay for a thirty dollar album, they'll stop charging thirty. There's nothing libertarian about this, it's just common sense.

vinyl,3czdnb,MrRom92,-2,Sun Jul 12 06:22:53 2015 UTC,"It's about perspective. It's good for record stores to reap high margins in the short term, but very bad in the long term. Eventually there will be a backlash and popularity in vinyl will wane. I'm not saying record stores should ""cut people a break."" I'm saying they should think more long term. It's not ""common sense"" to gouge people as much as you can whenever you can, that's actually a poor way to run a business.   People will stop paying $30 dollars for an album at some point, but maybe because they just wont be bothering with vinyl at all anymore.   I only bring up the terms ""free market"" and ""libertarian"" to point out the duplicity of record stores. In that owners justify high prices by saying ""that's what the market will bear"" and then simultaneous ask for a ""subsidy"" by shaming people for ""not supporting their local store."" In other words, charge whatever you want, but don't ask me to spend a little extra in your store just so you can stay in business. Also, don't get mad if I price check your shit on my phone."

I have a store in town that is competitively priced and usually has lower prices than Amazon on new releases.  They don't gouge on used prices and they are super cool people who don't 'shame' anyone.  As for expensive reissues just don't buy them.  I will admit to buying a few that I absolutely wanted but otherwise I stay away from overpriced shit.
vinyl,3czdnb,parccedres,-7,Sun Jul 12 11:27:10 2015 UTC,"That analogy makes absolutely no sense. The problem with records like this is that people are mislead to believe that $35 is a reasonable price (through market manipulation) and people who don't know any better believe it. Record label/stores that charge this much are taking advantage of people. The same way that labels took advantage of people in when cds came out.   What upsets me is people in the vinyl community who think this kind of behavior is ok. I'd rather a see a community that advocates for fair prices, rather than supporting some libertarian ideal of maximized profits. If you want maximized profits, you should trade stocks, not vinyl.   But whatever... You can find the same record on discogs for like $10. Just don't be the same person who cries because your local record store went out of business because their distributor won't sell them records that aren't price gouging people."

This will give you more money to throw at a decent receiver, a critically overlooked piece for newer collectors. A friend had a very nice upgraded Stanton that he had going through a fucking boom box, it sounded like shit and he never understood why Also Why are those prices so high? Amazon has the 120 listed at $250 in the US."
vinyl,3cx4at,theabolitionist,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:37:09 2015 UTC,I live in Canada so the LP120 generally runs around the 450 dollar mark.  I do have a decent receiver I am currently running a Yamaha HTR-5830 (no phono input though) with the Pioneer Bs22 speakers.
vinyl,3cx4at,dethrock,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:44:39 2015 UTC,"Depending on how much you want to spend, the LP120 is okay because of the built in preamp. I'd really recommend getting a different table and a separate phono-pre though."
vinyl,3cx4at,dethrock,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:49:06 2015 UTC,I don't really mind spending the extra $ if it's actually worth it. Even if I buy the LP120 I would eventually add a separate pre amp to my set up.  I'm really looking for a table around the 500 dollar range that will last a few years and will upgrade the sound from the Lp60. If the sound from a Rega or debut carbon is really that much better than the 120 I would be willing to spend the money. I'm thinking I can sell my Lp60 to get a pre-amp anyways.  Or I could buy records with the money I get from the Lp60.
vinyl,3cx4at,dethrock,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:59:18 2015 UTC,"If you will add a separate preamp later, I'd skip the LP120 and get something better. Where in Canada do you live? There's a lot of good stuff on Canuck Audio Mart or check your local Kijiji."

vinyl,3cx4at,OregonFreeman,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:32:25 2015 UTC,"Both the DC and RP1 is a good step above the LP120. The LP120's only advantage is the built-in preamp, which isn't that good to begin with, although it does what it's supposed to.  I'd probably go for the DC and spend the extra leftover money on a decent phono preamp."
vinyl,3csmak,_ryanthompson,9,Fri Jul 10 13:11:48 2015 UTC,"Coheed And Cambria has been one of my favorite bands for years. I've seen them countless times, read the comics, listened to the albums on repeat. When they reissued Second Stage Turbine Blade a few years ago, I wasn't into records that much, but I picked it up so I could get the VIP pass that came with the bundle. When I got the album in the mail, something clicked, and I thought ""having actual physical copies of these albums is pretty cool"", and since then, I've been collecting and listening to records constantly.  This is Coheed's complete (for now) vinyl discography. Every album except Good Apollo, I'm Burning Star IV, Volume 1: From Fear Through The Eyes Of Madness, which is as of yet to be released on vinyl. This includes: The Second Stage Turbine Blade in Keeping Secrets Of Silent Earth:3 No World For Tomorrow Year Of The Black Rainbow The Afterman: Ascension The Afterman: Ascention (Big Beige Demos) The Afterman: Descension  The Afterman: Descension (Big Beige Demos) The Afterman Deluxe Edition ...and the 7""s IRO-Bot/Elf Tower New Mexico A Favor House Atlantic Welcome Home The Suffering The Running Free Guns Of Summer  I'm super excited for their new album, so what better way to get ready than by celebrating their back catalog."

These things were pressed in extremely limited quantities, and not exactly treated well, so there are very few of the original copies left, meaning it doesn't take a lot of people to drive the price way up.

vinyl,3cwl33,mrbpar,19,Sat Jul 11 12:07:52 2015 UTC,Crosleys don't work and everytime it skips you've irreparably destroyed your record.  Life isn't fair sometimes.  Throw away your Crosley and by a real record player and set up.  That's the only advice that'll correct your problem.
vinyl,3cwl33,LutheranVinyl,9,Sat Jul 11 12:02:50 2015 UTC,I bought the same album and played it on a similar unit to what you have awhile back. The A side skipped in the same spots every time I tried it and distorted heavily. The rest of the sides worked without issue. I took it back to the shop where they played it on their player with no problems.   Unfortunately it's your player. You've just gotten lucky so far that this is the only one that skips. Your only option really is to get a better turntable.   That album sounds great on vinyl btw. It was the first thing I played when I upgraded to a Rega RP1.

vinyl,3cwl33,chippewhattha,2,Sat Jul 11 15:14:35 2015 UTC,"Pretty much going to say what others have said, but maybe also provide some insight. A couple of years ago I bought Daft Punk's Homework. It skipped badly, no scratches. I got the seller to send me a new one, because the record was warped, they sent me a new record, and that one skipped too. The record was only slightly warped, but when I got my AT-LP120, that record never skipped again. Some records, when pressed, are slightly wavy going left and right. With nicer turntables, you can adjust your tonearm weight and anti-aliasing, which will better follow the record when they have those small manufacturing issues.  Sadly, it is your table."
vinyl,3cwl33,timeddilation,2,Sat Jul 11 13:14:44 2015 UTC,"It's the Crosley, 100%. The record is fine it's the fact that you're using a low quality turntable to play it."
vinyl,3cwl33,JamesDeen99,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:56:29 2015 UTC,It's your player. Those things will not track high frequency passages at all. You can put penny on the head shell if you are desperate.
vinyl,3cwl33,crankyoldcoot,3,Sun Jul 12 22:50:23 2015 UTC,Most likely the tonearm is not weighted properly for the record.
vinyl,3cwl33,Taylorswiftfan69,4,Sat Jul 11 12:38:41 2015 UTC,"The crosley is not a good table but it won't be the sole reason for this   Yeah, it pretty much is.   When they're cutting a record, the engineers have a choice: They can either optimize the sound quality, or minimize the skipping on crappy record players. Nowadays, knowing that Shenzhen Skywin (Crosley etc.) cheapie players are flooding the market, they tend to choose the latter. ""Transatlanticism"" went with the former.   You can wash that record until it shines like the Chrysler building, it won't make any difference. A Crosley can't play it without skipping. It's too challenging.  But I'd love to hear the explanation on how you're supposed to ""correctly balance"" a Crosley tonearm."

While I acknowledge your motives, I'm afraid you just don't know enough about this topic to be dispensing advice.  Crosleys are not adjustable. They're toys. They use ceramic cartridges set to brute-force levels of VTF (something in the neighborhood of 6-7 grams). They can't track challenging records, and there's absolutely nothing you can do about it."
vinyl,3cwl33,mawnck,0,Sat Jul 11 16:40:39 2015 UTC,"Also, the small platter doesn't fully support the record.  Combine that with the high tracking force and it should be no surprise there are track 1 problems on challenging records; the ideal physics are totally destabilized."

You see the denial that is necessary to keep collecting even when there's so much you haven't listened to.  You see the heartbreak of losing your collection, or selling off parts of it.  You see the thrill of the hunt, and the anticlimactic moment of actually buying your 'grail'.    It's sad and amazing.  It makes you scared that you share the same characteristics of these people, but also makes you feel better that you're not as bad as them... yet.

After that, I never had any luck at a Goodwill again. Find a lot of the same stuff the OP mentioned above. The only other purchase I've made from one in the past year was pretty beat up copy of Night Moves by Bob Seger.

I did a search on here, and haven't been able to find any other talk about it. Just wondering what your guys's opinions are! Thanks for any help/info!"

vinyl,3csxf9,deanwinters,2,Fri Jul 10 14:48:00 2015 UTC,"It's a pretty lengthy title for a record.   The Kossoy sisters are probably most well knows for their version of ""I'll Fly Away"" which was featured on the Oh Brother Where art Thou sound track. The entire Bowling Green Album is a collection of haunting two part harmony folk songs. Several murder ballads as well.  I have been looking for this record for ever, so finding a sealed copy of it was pretty exciting. I still haven't opened it. There's something that feels almost wrong about opening a record that has laid undisturbed for almost 60 years."

I knew I wanted to add lights and a front panel to hide everything, so My roommate and I custom cut some thin plywood and glued it on with liquid nails. I added 5 inches to the top of the cabinet for a recessed area to put a couple RGB LED strips. I got a piece of white acrylic cut to fit on top, and held it up with custom cut clear acrylic cylinders. The cylinders aren't passing enough light, so they leave a small shadow, so I'll probably build another edge inside to hold it up instead. Just about $200 in materials, which I don't think is too bad for custom furniture."

vinyl,3cvoj2,MrRom92,2,Sat Jul 11 06:33:45 2015 UTC,aww that's sad to hear. Which reissues in particular are you referring to?
vinyl,3cvoj2,MrRom92,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:24:45 2015 UTC,"They are the 45rpm reissues issued by analogue productions or music matters. Music matters also recently did a 33rpm series which is more like what they were upon initial release (and more comparable to the blue note 75 series) and they have been getting great reviews since they've been produced with great care, unlike the 75 series. The 45rpm 2LP reissues are a cut above though. The music matters 33s are probably the next best thing.   I have my fair share of blue note 1st pressings, but they are neat historically. They are not a sonic pleasure and they don't sound anything like what's on the tapes. They are not at all worth what they fetch on the market IMO, I don't understand how people commonly pay hundreds for these, if not more. Meanwhile the 45 rpms can leave you in disbelief that you're listening to a (50+ year old!!!) recording and not a live event. They are only $50 (and some even less now that AP has recently lowered the prices on some titles.)"

vinyl,3cvo8h,Jonlaw16,3,Sat Jul 11 04:02:28 2015 UTC,When it gets to the point it's louder than the audio of the song. The only album I have that happens on is Night Moves by Bob Seger which I got from a thrift store. It really sucked too because my favorite track on that album is the title track and that's when it's at its worst.
vinyl,3cvo8h,JimmysLostFat,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:42:37 2015 UTC,My copy of masters of reality by black Sabbath has some pops and surface noise but it's loud enough that you don't really hear it as much.
vinyl,3cvo8h,Rhuey13,3,Sat Jul 11 04:55:33 2015 UTC,"I've been asking myself that question for decades.  Cleaning solves so much of this. I've been buying VG+ records all my life but I didn't learn to properly clean them until three years ago.  Those $3 and $4 classic albums I bought in the 90's sound fantastic today, especially after cleaning.  No, it doesn't involve glue.  Saturated wet cleaning, especially when you can vacuum away the solution rather than using cloths, makes all the difference. Record cleaning is not exotic science, it's the same real-world physics as cleaning anything else around the house. You wouldn't wash dishes or vacuum the carpet with a carbon fibre brush and expect them to be spotless, so you shouldn't expect it to fix your crackly records.    You don't have to buy a super expensive audiophile cleaner or solution either.  For $60 you can get everything you need.  $50 at the hardware store to buy a small shop vac, a flat paint pad for scrubbing and supplies to prepare the nozzle, and another $10 for supplies to make a gallon cleaning solution.  That's cheaper than a Spin Clean, if that $10 even mattered.  If the record was reasonably well kept in the first place, cleaning will get it back to almost NM in many cases.  Banged up stuff will always be banged up stuff.  I swap in another cart to play those - and I love them too!"

vinyl,3cvo8h,JimmysLostFat,2,Sat Jul 11 04:51:51 2015 UTC,My wall is similar except it's only audible at quiet parts. My copy of in the court of that crimson king has a fair amount of surface noise and it does enhance it.

Second time around with records as primary music source, deafer ears that miss some frequencies, I'm ok with most surface noise unless that's all I hear. A few exceptions, New ""whats going on album"" that was horribly pressed and sold in (I think) PVC plastic that sounds HORRIBLE. An original 1962 pressing of something is allowed to pop and crack a bit and still sounds better to these ears than digital."

vinyl,3cqv0m,astrovinyl,5,Fri Jul 10 01:47:45 2015 UTC,"Do it!  It all started with a hand-me-down Slow Train Coming from my parents. Then I slowly over time picked up a few of the staples like Blonde on Blonde, Desire, Blood on The Tracks and Highway 61 Revisited.  Then whenever I saw some of the other ones for a decent price, I would pick them up (mostly just to listen to some of the lesser known songs). I eventually realized that I was 10 records short, then only 5, then I started to obsess over it and hunted down the last few pieces. Obviously since I collected them mostly casually, the hardest ones to find were left for last.  I decided to cut it off before 1980 because 1. I had to limit myself somewhere short of his 40+ albums and 2. I felt that most of his best stuff ended in the 70's.  I was a pretty good Dylan fan before, but after completing the collection and having a chance to really sit down and listen to all his songs over that period and hear for the first time a lot of his back catalogue, I have grown into an obsessive mega fan.  It's really cool to listen to all the records and be able to see through the words and into his life as it evolved through historical instances, as well as personal life events."

Every Dylan fan in the nation has heard at least some passing mention of this now famous bootleg."" Blind Boy Grunt was an alias of Dylan's he used when not recording for Columbia.There are four songs about venereal disease. Much of this stuff never officially came out, but did appear on CD boots like The Minnesota Tapes. More info here: http://www.punkhart.com/dylan/tapes/61-dec22.html"

If you're looking for a good B-sidesl official vinyl release, look up Side Tracks, which spans 1962-1990's and has some phenomenal releases.  Other than that I would recommend all the bootleg series, especially the last two, which are fantastic vinyl pressings."
vinyl,3cqv0m,wawalemontrees,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:02:58 2015 UTC,Oh Mercy - that's the only one you need. I'm working on a podcast about Dylan in the 80's right now; Oh Mercy is the only one you need...

I'll say that while most of his stuff before the 80's is his best, don't rule out his later works like Time Out Of Mind, Love & Theft and Modern Times, those are all quality albums in my mind."

I'm seriously so excited to add this soundtrack to my ever-growing collection. The sound quality is actually pretty decent for being a compilation of different artists with some tracks being a little more remastered than others. I'm currently playing it on a Uturn orbit turntable plugged into an art Dj preamp and a Marshall stanmore speaker. This was pressed by Mondo in 2014 on a purple ""infinity"" stone 180 gram LP. The jacket, sleeve, and artwork are all hand screen-printed, and you can see in the quality of the silver on the front how much effort was put into making this a beautiful record. I acquired it through a trade as I was not willing to pay a flipper $150+ for a soundtrack (nor any album for that matter). Thanks for looking!"

vinyl,3cuasu,Loud_Vinyl_Disks,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:28:39 2015 UTC,I simply do not agree with this at all. I've gotten so many excellent vintage carts on used decks I've purchased with perfectly good original styli on them. Use it as is to play a test disk that you really wouldn't get upset about damaging. If it doesn't sound right get out the protractor and make sure the cart is aligned properly before buying replacements.
vinyl,3cuasu,chippewhattha,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:32:18 2015 UTC,"The suspension can go bad if unused for a long period of time, which is likely the case with these garage sale finds - if it's coming from an enthusiast or a dealer then it's likely safe but there are few vintage carts in the wild that are verifiably up to spec. The cart itself is likely fine (some extensive testing could sort that out) but in most cases if you don't know the history of the diamond and the thing has sat unused for years, it's got to go - even if the tip itself is pristine."

Besides, Flood works better on a CD (heresy, sorry), as Flood II and Flood III are meant to flow seamlessly into one another.  A new version of Flood for such an LP release would be cool though (although I don't think boris wants to cover old ground)."
vinyl,3cpaa2,redplasticgoat,2,Thu Jul 9 22:14:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're probably right but given the current popularity of the format I think that if it were ever going to happen it would be now.

vinyl,3ctxrd,chippewhattha,0,Sat Jul 11 00:11:15 2015 UTC,I don't get this.  It's only a potential sale.  What has that cost you? It's not like you shipped a record and didn't get paid for it.

vinyl,3ctxrd,BlindWillieBrown,2,Sat Jul 11 18:19:55 2015 UTC,"When you select ""Buy Now"",  it takes that record off the market until you cancel.

vinyl,3cs0j1,istartedafire,4,Fri Jul 10 08:28:52 2015 UTC,"When buying a second hand player it is always a good idea to replace the needle, chances are high that its worn. You can also inspect it under a microscope / magnifying glass, but it's no always easy to tell if the stylus needs replacing. Reference images are available online.  Once you have a new one you can usually find out how long it will generally last before needing to be replaced again. Once you actually hear changes in the sound because of wear you should definitely replace it, but it might have already caused some damage."
vinyl,3cs0j1,dardarian89,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:47:48 2015 UTC,"Great advice, I really appreciate it. I'll go ahead and purchase a new needle for it. Might you have any recommendations on where to buy them?"
vinyl,3cs0j1,dardarian89,2,Fri Jul 10 10:13:03 2015 UTC,"I would first of all try to determine which stylus (=needle + the plastic thing attached to the needle that clicks it to the turntable arm) you need (i.e. the make and model). Usually this is inscribed in the stylus itself or you can find it in the turntable booklet (if you still have it).  Best option would be to google that and see if it is available online. Some stores might also be able to help you further but it depends where you are from if you have one near you (don't forget to bring the old stylus so you can check if you buy the right one).  If you want to invest some more time you could also look into an improved stylus that will fit your turntable arm (for better sound quality, assuming the rest of your gear is of good quality), but it can be a bit of a puzzle which one would be right for you (also a high-end stylus can be expensive).  As a side note, sometime the same stylus will be available in a conical/spherical or elliptical variety. This refers to the shape of the tip of the needle, and can have an influence on sound quality as well as on skipping. If you find multiple varieties you could look into their individual benefits and drawbacks when you choose (I'm not sure which type is actually 'better', I believe there is a lot of discussion on the subject and it also depends on the make and model of the stylus. As always, Google is you friend for these questions)."
vinyl,3cs0j1,Wraith8888,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:28:31 2015 UTC,"Actually, better to look for the make and model of the cartridge (that the stylus attaches to). Then search out the different styli options that will fit it."
vinyl,3cs0j1,Loud_Vinyl_Disks,3,Fri Jul 10 20:23:42 2015 UTC,You may want to try playing a record that you do not care about before going out and purchasing a new stylus. I've bought many used decks where the stylus was just fine and did not need replacing.

vinyl,3ctdon,nevermind4790,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:21:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but I am generally very happy with NAD, and shielding + avoiding more cables sound like positives, so I am simply making sure there isn't something painfully wrong with my chain of thought (like how you wouldn't use a 2$ china-dac with my amp, as even if it technicaly would work, it wouldn't sound very impressive..)."
vinyl,3ctdon,nevermind4790,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:46:38 2015 UTC,"Eh, I'm not sure how much of a difference that would actually make, or if it's more of marketing and whatnot. Look at high end audiophile systems, they use separates for everything which includes extra cables. Regardless, focus on buying the turntable first and phono preamp next."
vinyl,3ctdon,nevermind4790,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:43:04 2015 UTC,"Was in at my local hifi store today, and they actually recommended me to buy a seperate phono instead of buying the module one, and suggested one that was actually a few $ cheaper than the module, so I guess it wasn't simply meant as marketing. They are also able to import other turntables which they don't carry in stock if I was interested (so I asked about pro-ject Xpression, and he's going to make me an offer on monday).

Some of them previously unreleased, incomplete, out of print, hard to find, or not preserved in the best possible quality. For the first time ever, we are releasing your favorite soundtracks in comprehensive collector's editions: restored, remastered, often in unprecedented quality.  We are working with researchers, consultants and world class engineers to bring you the best possible versions of these soundtracks. We are also working closely with developers, license holders and original sound teams. All of our work will be overseen and approved by the respective composers or the person in charge of the sound team (wherever possible). On top of that, our physical releases will contain extras like interviews, art booklets and more.   Hot damn, it appears to be a whole new label for vidya game soundtracks. That's pretty cool."

Ship To Shore Phono Co. is releasing the soundtrack to MOTHER in November (thanks to a succesful Kickstarter) and has seriously teased releasing another entry in the MOTHER series as well.  SpaceLab9 have announced a new VGM series with an official announcement of a Mega Man Best Of 1-10 compilation (releases on July 17 as a Hot Topic exclusive picture disc with a general release at a later undisclosed date). Has also teased a release in the Fallout series, possibly a Fallout 3 OST.  iam8bit have already released the 3LP OST for Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number and has preorders up for the Journey soundtrack. They've just announced that they're doing the soundtrack for Battletoads as well for San Diego Comic-Con and later for the general public.  Ghostly International are slowly testing the waters as well. Released a soundtrack teaser on vinyl for Hohokum last year and are releasing the Minecraft Volume Alpha soundtrack on August 21.  Invada is also doing a little VGM and have currently released the soundtracks to Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon, Watch_Dogs, and Far Cry 4 on vinyl.

Power love did Blood Dragon so I was sad to miss out on that on RSD   Invada reissued it on standard black so unless you really want the colored version (which is pretty expensive by now) you can order it straight from Invada (and probably other sites as well if you're in the US)."

vinyl,3cpwub,Sweet_Vandal,4,Thu Jul 9 20:46:30 2015 UTC,"One of my all-time favorite albums came in the mail yesterday: Ramshackle Glory's ""Live the Dream.""  For any of you folks that take an interest in folk-punk, or groups like Andrew Jackson Jihad, Ghost Mice, Days 'N' Daze, Against Me!, etc.  Live the Dream is just plain fantastic. In terms of lyircal content, I think Pat the Bunny is an absolute genius. The album covers everything from addiction and recovery, depression, personal politics, etc. Almost every track gives me chills at some point.  Plan-It-X finally repressed it. I just figured that it was such a small thing that I'd never end up with a copy, so I was stoked to see that. If anyone's interested in picking one up, you can order them directly through their website.  Anyway, a few samples of some of my favorite lines:  We Are All Compost In Training  I fell asleep smoking so I’d wake up on fire, 'Cause that might get me out of bed for a while And back into battle with the things that I breathe, And the holes in my arms, and the way that I think. And if freedom is doing what I want, well that means I gotta know what is, not just what it isn’t. So I’ll dig up the dirt and I’ll throw down some seeds, 'Cause the world needs more spinach, Not more motherfuckers like me.  From Here To Utopia  Because I’m afraid to look the world in the eye. If nothing’s gonna change, well, then I’d rather die. And I’m too unemployed to organize a union. I’m too intoxicated to tear down a building. I’m too hopeless to look for a solution, I’m afraid that if I found one, I’d be out of excuses for the way I waste away in the gutters that I chose, Like fashion accessories to go with my dirty clothes. I haven’t bathed in months, but you know it’s not because I’ve been fighting bourgeois morals, I’m just lazy and I’m young.  Never Coming Home  I’m coming home, it’s late again, I’m high as I’ve ever been. You’re sitting up, you’re in our bed crying for a ghost again. No room could be as dark or as empty as ours is, Because I’m at home but I’m not here, and I never am.  TL;DR - Live the Dream is really good and you can buy a copy from Plan-It-X now.    Edit: I guess I should talk about the actual LP, too, huh? It sounds a lot better than I was expecting it to. I definitely own shittier pressings. I only really linked the cover, since everything else is pretty unremarkable. There's an insert included, but I haven't had a chance to look it over just yet."

vinyl,3ctbe9,dethrock,6,Fri Jul 10 16:57:31 2015 UTC,It's 100 pages+ of forums with images just tell us what happens!
vinyl,3ctbe9,E4ZYM0N3Y,6,Fri Jul 10 17:04:31 2015 UTC,"I've read that thread before, so here goes:  TL;DR: The shop is not sketchy per se (as in you get what you buy, don't worry), but the label owner has been proven to flip his own releases on eBay (the rare, low-numbered ones) pretending to be someone else. He later appears in the thread himself claiming to not be him, but is quickly disproved by people who have previously bought from him on the same forum.  I think that sums it up.  EDIT: Still reading, I forgot a lot of this shit. The label owner is such a moron! He later returned claiming that he's sharing his eBay and Paypal account with a friend. Who does that?!  EDIT2: It gets better. The label owner's ex-girlfriend shows up in the thread - nothing juicy or distasteful, but she pretty much confirms that he has a tendency to screw over people he's working with. A former employee from the label confirms this as well.  EDIT3: Not just on eBay. He seems to deliberately keep a stock of his rare records in order to either flip it or trade it for stuff he wants himself. People have supposedly been trading with him on various forums where he would often ""happen to find a copy"".  EDIT4: This is actually important if you decide to buy releases from the shop - he has been proven to use CD sources for some of his releases. On an occasion he even asked online for a used copy of a CD that he could use as a source for a vinyl release."
vinyl,3ctbe9,rpbtz,4,Fri Jul 10 17:14:02 2015 UTC,Are people really buying the Doug Soundtrack thinking it's an analog or hi res source???
vinyl,3ctbe9,isthishandletaken,3,Fri Jul 10 18:22:05 2015 UTC,"Well, I guess the sourcing issue was more directed to his non-cartoon releases. I doubt many people would buy Nicktoon soundtracks with the expectation of reaching audiophile nirvana."
vinyl,3ctbe9,rpbtz,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:31:02 2015 UTC,Its a tribute album.  They are covers.  I'm ok with this.
vinyl,3ctbe9,ThisBikeIsAPipeBomb,2,Sat Jul 11 16:24:27 2015 UTC,Not to mention he pressed more copies/different variants of releases without telling the band(s?).
vinyl,3ctbe9,dethrock,3,Fri Jul 10 19:55:30 2015 UTC,"There was a bunch of drama with him releasing Cartel's Chroma. He apparently contacted the band about it, they didn't want him to release it because they planned on doing it themselves, but he went and pressed it anyway. A bit of info here http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=3699386  Not sure if on purpose or by accident, but there were overrun copies of The Early November's Acoustic EP. He screen printed jackets for them and was selling them through a friends eBay account. Someone posted a picture of one they ordered with a hand written note about not saying anything about buying it, since he wasn't allowed to be selling them in the first place.  He was apparently going to press a Scary Kids Scaring Kids album but it fell through. There were still test presses for it which he has sold (obviously he shouldn't be doing this.)  There's a bunch of other stuff too which is in that Vinyl Collective thread."
vinyl,3ctbe9,ForeverOrange15,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:13:18 2015 UTC,This was my first buy from here... what do you know that we don't know?
vinyl,3ctbe9,dethrock,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:57:45 2015 UTC,It is also my first purchase from here. From what little I read it seems  like some of the problems are with the grab bags.
vinyl,3ctbe9,dorktwinkle,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:10:17 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, it has nothing to do with the store being sketchy, you'll get your records."
vinyl,3ctbe9,DeuceSK,3,Fri Jul 10 17:20:46 2015 UTC,Serious question: why would anyone buy this stupid shit?
vinyl,3ctbe9,mawnck,0,Fri Jul 10 19:47:16 2015 UTC,Because of the 90s nostalgia. A generation that's at least as annoying as the boomers in regard to their past. The 90s sucked ass.
vinyl,3ctbe9,TheSebadoh,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:58:47 2015 UTC,The 90s sucked ass.   Can confirm.
vinyl,3ctbe9,FunbagsMcBooty,2,Sat Jul 11 00:26:18 2015 UTC,"Oh lawd... I typically stay away from nostalgia type stuff from the 90s but I gotta have the beets on vinyl. Just ordered mine, thanks for the heads up"

vinyl,3cnzgl,rpbtz,11,Thu Jul 9 12:01:47 2015 UTC,agreed.  I think I'll post more of my metal / noise / doom / instrumental collections
vinyl,3cnzgl,rpbtz,4,Thu Jul 9 12:59:09 2015 UTC,"Please do, I'd love to see it :)"
vinyl,3cnzgl,SUN-BAT-HER,3,Thu Jul 9 13:10:08 2015 UTC,Probably because a lot of their quality stuff is rare.
vinyl,3cnzgl,slavikcc,5,Thu Jul 9 17:58:17 2015 UTC,This is one of their best albums.  I got this personally autographed by the band when they came to Ottawa some years back.
vinyl,3cnzgl,TheBobby_Digital,3,Thu Jul 9 12:41:08 2015 UTC,"I love this album!  I own this on CD and vinyl (which in my opinion is the better of the two).  You are right on when you say Southern Lord killed this.  I also have Smile in both formats.  Same thing there the vinyl version has a different running order, some of the songs are alternate versions, and there are two extra tracks.  These two albums are a couple of the few exceptions to my rule of not purchasing vinyl I own on CD.  And investment or not both of them end up on my turntable regularly.  No other way to enjoy them."
vinyl,3cnzgl,kcxzoo,3,Thu Jul 9 14:17:09 2015 UTC,"What a great album. The gatefold looks gorgeous too. Didn't know it rare, what's the going rate for this?"
vinyl,3cnzgl,GG_Allin_Feces,2,Thu Jul 9 15:47:56 2015 UTC,Depends.  Picked it up for $6 in a bargain bin here in Virginia.
vinyl,3cnzgl,elvismcvegas,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:45:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i paid 40 for my first one and 35 for the second one, but i gave it a friend for 35."
vinyl,3cnzgl,gunstar,3,Fri Jul 10 01:59:17 2015 UTC,Every day I search the internet for deals on this. And every day I am disappointed.
vinyl,3cnzgl,daebat,3,Thu Jul 9 16:12:09 2015 UTC,Great album!
vinyl,3cnzgl,slackingatlazyboy,3,Thu Jul 9 17:12:23 2015 UTC,"This is my favorite Boris record, and one of my holy grails.  Thanks for posting one of these days I'm going to have a copy"
vinyl,3cnzgl,robxburninator,2,Thu Jul 9 17:16:11 2015 UTC,"Not trying to be ugly but isn't this like, a $50 record?  I can't think that if Indiana jones could buy the ark of the covenant for $50 it wouldn't be much of a Grail. If it's really a Grail, just sell 6 records and buy it?"
vinyl,3cnzgl,slackingatlazyboy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:34:47 2015 UTC,Man i knew I was going to be called out on that!  Your right brother I'm a cheapass.  Going to have to get it next payday.  Kinda have to now or I'd really be a chump huh?!?
vinyl,3cnzgl,robxburninator,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:51:39 2015 UTC,"Totally not trying to be a jerk, it's just.... If it's the thing you want the most then cleanse yourself of records you just like and buy it. People are always posting their $100 grails and its like, save $20 a month for 5 months. Bam. It's not a Grail if the slightest amount of fiscal awareness can get you the record. Eat pb&j for a couple weeks and it's yours."
vinyl,3cnzgl,slackingatlazyboy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:07:24 2015 UTC,So true my man so true.  But for me these days 50 bucks is a lot .  Probably about half of my 'fun' money a lot myself each week.  I was kinda using holy grail loosely it's an album I really want.  Your right though people should tighten up their grail references
vinyl,3cnzgl,slackingatlazyboy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:11:47 2015 UTC,"It might be not an incredibly rare record, but sometimes Grails are about the search at a price.  It doesn't matter if you can get it, but the quest itself to get it.  Sometimes resolving the search with the quickest solution doesn't quench the thirst"
vinyl,3cnzgl,SirCuntJuicer_IV,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:13:46 2015 UTC,"Its up there, this version was 70$ on Discogs.  I added this and a Black Moth Super Rainbow release yesterday, which apparently that one is going for like 120$.  My holy grail is Explosions in the Sky - How Strange, Innocent.  Last copy went for $750.  Fuck that"
vinyl,3cnzgl,SemiHollowCarrot,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:12:27 2015 UTC,Depends on how much you like peanut butter and jelly sandwiches
vinyl,3cnzgl,xMdot,3,Thu Jul 9 20:30:46 2015 UTC,YES! My favorite Boris album of all time! I also own the clear pink version on vinyl. You own any other Boris records?
vinyl,3cnzgl,racer_xtc,2,Thu Jul 9 17:48:45 2015 UTC,"yeah, Smile and Altar from what I can remember.  I'm only half way through adding my collection to Discogs"
vinyl,3cnzgl,summerisle2,4,Thu Jul 9 19:11:15 2015 UTC,"I thought I would post one of my most rare and loved albums.  One of the best efforts ever put forth by this band.  I was adding it to my discogs, and graced over the price of this particular version.    The vinyl has a slightly different track order, which I think lends to a better overall album.  Southern Lord really killed it.  There are other presses of this record that are even more rare, but I am plenty happy having a record I can still play without thinking that I might ruin an investment.  Included are 3 sheets of ""acid"", paper is all perforated and everything.  I never noticed it until taking photos for y'all  Maybe I'll post some other albums if people like it"
vinyl,3cnzgl,atarigw,3,Thu Jul 9 11:38:36 2015 UTC,"The other, more rare version, kinda sucks."

vinyl,3cmboi,WhyaintweatDorsia,258,Thu Jul 9 00:48:35 2015 UTC,"Once again, sorry for the wall of text and the shitty English.  Note: Last month, I made this post saying that I finally pressed my own music. A lot of /r/vinyl users bought a copy. Thank you so much. We sold almost every copy in 48 hours.  So last Saturday Ghostface Killah was at the Montreal Jazz Fest with Badbadnotgood and I thought it would be a good idea to give him a copy of my album since it’s an instrumental LP and I’m a huge Wu-Tang fan. I went in front of the stage and managed to throw the record next to his water bottles before the security staff could do anything. Luckily enough it landed on the right side so he could read the note that I wrote (Something like : ''Hey Dennis, I’m Morti. I might be your next producer, you just don’t know it yet.'').  I went back to the bar thinking that I probably wasted one of my last copies remaining when the music stops and I hear Ghostface saying: ''What the fuck is this? Who’s Morti? Come here!''. Needless to say that I did. Nobody really knew what was going on, but didn’t have any problem getting near the security staff this time. When I reached the stage he asked ''Is this for me? You made this?'' and he shook my hand and thanked me. I told him that it was an honour and he said ‘’Balsy motherfucker’’ with a smile. Then he gave the LP to a member of his staff who brought it backstage. I don’t know if he’ll ever listen to it but I can at least hope."
vinyl,3cmboi,CHILL__MURRAY,73,Thu Jul 9 00:49:03 2015 UTC,"Good for you dude! I can already see this being a ""how I made it"" story. Sometimes you just gotta throw it in their face! Best of luck to you"

vinyl,3cmboi,Crow_The_Robot,0,Thu Jul 16 18:56:31 2015 UTC,Perhaps some beat changes. The loop gets pretty boring after a while. Sounds like a throwaway from Campfire Headphase.
vinyl,3cmboi,BIGlikeaBOSS,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:34:07 2015 UTC,I totally agree that the drums get repetitive. Keep in mind that this is a pretty old track taken from a concept tape. I didn't really want to share it in this particular thread. I can live with the fact that it sounds like a pale copy of Boards of Canada though. I love these guys!
vinyl,3cmboi,Hasthefeelinggone,14,Thu Jul 9 20:38:19 2015 UTC,"Consider how many people try to reach out to hit him up, giving him their tapes and cd's. Approaching him in public, sending them to his house, managers, through friends and acquaintances. It must happen very frequently, to the point where he never has time to, or even considers giving it a listen. You took time to create, and bring into fruition an entire vinyl you produced (which surely brought back nostalgia of his come up), and delivered it to him in one of the most unique fashions possible. In my honest opinion, he will DEFINITELY give it a spin. As for your work, I love the vibe of the album. I am a big fan of hip-hop, The Wu and Ghostdeini especially. I truly can envision Ghost going in on a number of your tracks.   So I say to you my friend; congratulations on your album, taking a chance, getting noticed, and hopefully working with The Wu-Tang Clan!   Put your W's up."
vinyl,3cmboi,boxenstien,4,Thu Jul 9 04:10:43 2015 UTC,That's what most of my friends told me. I usually don't have any expectations for anything but I sure like your theory! I guess time will tell.

I only listened to a few seconds of the tracks online, but now that I've given the entire LP a few spins, I have to say that I really enjoy it.  You make awesome beats.  What I really like are the various instruments you throw in.  There's a cut with a piano in it on side 2 which is totally hot.  Can you list some inspirational artists for you or some other artists who have a similar sound?"
vinyl,3cmboi,cabasse,7,Thu Jul 9 03:58:33 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks for the feedback. I wouldn't really compare my stuff to these guys' but I used to listen to a lot of sample based producers like Dj Shadow, Blockhead, Meaty Ogre, Sixtoo (his Duration LP), Express Rising, Joe Beats, Jel, Moodswing 9, Maker. Now I'm more into 70's prog rock  and Shoegaze though. This might have influenced my sound as well."
vinyl,3cmboi,Enviromente,2,Thu Jul 9 04:09:03 2015 UTC,"Nice list, thanks.  Definitely heard some DJ Shadow influence.  And props to whomever mastered your LP.  Thought the sound itself was really good, especially how that high hat cuts through at exactly the right times without over saturating."

I mean not even at the record store, concert, record show, auction, etc. where people are actively talking about ""records""."
vinyl,3co3ed,Twilightcampfighter1,5,Thu Jul 9 22:51:08 2015 UTC,Nice post. I've mentioned this a couple time before but I've had records packed to withstand a tank assault show up with holes punched clean through (vinyl and all) and records packed in what equates to a brown paper bag arrive in pristine shape. It's all about the journey. This approach certainly helps though.
vinyl,3co3ed,GothamCountySheriff,6,Thu Jul 9 12:44:36 2015 UTC,"I always appreciate people putting in the effort to try and protect records when they ship them. And I think this is a valiant effort. BUT... There are a few issues I have with the packaging.   The main one is the lack of backing boards between the album and the mailer. In the OP's guide it only shows bubble wrap. The backing boards are integral to the packing process in that they provide a buffer between the mailer and the record. The backing board buffer helps keep the integrity of the mailer intact by adding rigidity; adds additional (though admittedly minimal) corner protection; helps guard against warping and will absorb the kenetic energy of hits to the outside of the package -- reducing the damage to the mailer.  Second, in his guide, the OP is reusing a previous mailer. Generally that is fine. But the OP's example mailer is past its useful life. The reason is the sides, as well as the flat surfaces, have multiple bends and folds. The reason the cardboard mailers are able to protect against damage is because the cardboard acts as a complete solid unit that deflects potential damaging hits that occur when shipping, and radiating them across the rest of the mailer. And if the hits is too severe for the cardboard to deflect, it will then will absorb them. If the cardboard has already served its purpose deflecting and absorbing said hits, as evidenced by deep bends and folds, then the structural integrity of the mailer is compromised and it can no longer do its job. In the OP's guide, his mailer in compromised, and that leaves the record jacket, and record itself, as the main elements of structural integrity. If there were backing boards, they would certainly help, but it's the backing boards plus a solid mailer that really create integrity for the package.  Third, the OP shows the vinyl being removed from the inner sleeve and packed nude (without any replacement sleeve). This is a bad idea. Because of void space and lack of friction, there is already a potential issue of shifting vinyl when it is packed in its original or a replacement inner sleeve. This movement can lead to scuffing of the record. By leaving the vinyl naked (and without the rigidity and pressure of a backing board) it will invariably shift during the shipping process, causing scuffing and potentially damage the record, the packaging, or both. This can be all but eliminated if the packaging uses backing boards to remove void space and the edges are tight and square to hold everything in place.   Last is a smaller, but important issue. The OP shows the records being inserted in-between the outside sleeves of a gatefold cover. While this is a bit better than shipping them in the jacket itself, they still have a high potential to split the spine of the gatefold. This is especially true since they aren't being buffered from the jacket by their inner sleeves.  There are a couple of extras in the OP's guide that were worth exploring. Bubble wrap, in addition to a solid mailer and backing boards, will help absorb hits to the package. The corner bumpers were also a good addition (if not a little time consuming). If you are interested in adding an additional layer of protection to your mailer, check out this photo set of a mailer I received. It is just a pair of U-folded cardboard pieces that have a 0.5-0.75"" overhang. They add an additional layer of stability to the package, but more importantly add a crumple zone to the outside edges that supplants the need for corner bumpers.  I don't mean to crap on OP's thread. But if the guide is to serve as a tool for getting records from point-A to point-B undamaged, then it needs to have correct information that takes into account how and why packaging works. How do I know my methods work? Well, from personal experience for sure, but also from past experience working for FedEx. I worked for FedEx for over seven years, and in that time I attended many boring meetings and training sessions that focused on the ins-and-outs of proper packaging. In those trainings, I learned a lot of methods for shipping all sorts of items large and small. I learned about the shipping process, how a package moves through it, and how to pack items to insure they survive the journey. I used that information to insure that my own packages meet a minimal packing standard that offers it a very good chance in surviving the shipping process."

vinyl,3co3ed,jewunit,3,Fri Jul 10 01:05:25 2015 UTC,"I use 12"" cardboard squares sandwiching either side of my records instead of bubble wrap. You want the whole ""sandwich"" to be thick enough that it's tight in the box and won't slid around, thus reducing the risk of corner dents. I've found that bubble wrap slides around too easily."
vinyl,3co3ed,sithmafia,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:41:36 2015 UTC,"I agree.  Bubblewrap certainly doesn't hurt, and if the mailer is big enough, it's worth chucking some of that in too, but two slices of cardboard is always prefereable."

As I receive vinyl almost every week, I see a lot of falsely packed vinyl, leading to sometimes terrible damages (I've covered some of them here). As I live Europe, I sometimes get vinyl which is packed well enough for shipping inside a country, but not for international shipping. That's why I've wanted to cover my personal shipping method. I think it is a nice addition to the already existing guide by /u/GothamCountySheriff , to be found here.     If you have any feedback, I'd be happy to read it. Thanks!"

Probably the best collaboration they have done with Merzbow as well, though it seems like he just does the same stuff every record.  Has some tracks from Feedbacker, Akuma no Uta, Mabuta no Ura, Droneevil, Pink, and Rainbow.  A very very solid collection across a handful of their best albums.  Great fidelity as well.    It's nice to have a live record of theirs that isn't a different take on their studio material (drumless shows, drone shows, etc).    Slightly more compact version of Feedbacker, better than studio version of Blackout as well.  Problem is that Feedbacker is split between two sides.  Put out by Southern Lord, so the whole package is quality."
vinyl,3cojve,SirCuntJuicer_IV,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:51:20 2015 UTC,Probably one of my favorite live albums of all time. It's also the closest thing I'll have to ever get Akuma no Uta on vinyl since it has a couple of songs on it haha.

vinyl,3crcfh,Imnotgodoranything,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:19:33 2015 UTC,"A mixer won't affect anything. And really it would be a better solution than a switch (of any sort) without getting a reciever. A mixer's purpose is to mix any number of inputs to a single output. Each channel can be selectively muted and you can monitor individual channels (not output to main but to secondary). In your case since you already have the powered speakers, you just need the single source. But since you want multiples, a mixer will more effectively switch between sources than a kludge solution of daisy chained switches. Soundstage will not be affected by a mixer."

vinyl,3cq4gm,LoveLifeLiberty,4,Thu Jul 9 21:43:30 2015 UTC,"I bought it in Japan at the yodobashi camera store at significant savings. Had been using a Stanton 881s before, but after the stylus broke I had to get by on an extra goldring. Always wanted to try moving coil and had recently upgraded my phono stage with an Emotiva unit that can load moving coil. I have always wanted to try the Denon ""House"" sound as well so jumped on my opportunity in Japan.   I had a listen in the horrible store environment and preferred the sound of the 301mkII over the 103r, even my girlfriend preferred the sound which is a big plus! she does not usually comment on such matters.... Just got home and mounted it on my old Technics table and it sounds great! Listened to some Ella and Louis  and then some Hendrix cry of love. I was hoping the Denon warm ""house"" sound would tame the highs on my Polks and it has! the sound is very detailed still, with strong bass response, much stronger bass then I have heard on vinyl before. Over all very detailed and articulate while still having a very pleasing warmness as well as a very enveloping sound field. The 103r sounded to forward and overly strong mids making the sound very pushy instead of the articulate enveloping sound of the 301mkII. I will be pleased to see how it breaks in and expect to enjoy many records with this cartridge.  Oh and this cartridge does ride very quietly, not getting upset about surface noise, minimizing it a lot while tracking excellently."

It is really an excellent cartridge for the price, and in my opinion is a much more pleasing sound than ortofons of a comparable price.   Being kinda low output MC with a great stylus profile was a big plus as it seems to convey alot more detail. It will improve over the next 20 hours but the house sound will not change at all. Very even presentation with great bass response, though not bass boosted in any way! Reggae and house music sound as good as metal, and punk. It can be a little critical of bad recordings though, as any good cartridge, and you will be able to hear any other upgrades you make to your system.   Also I have now upgraded my 1200s tonearm to a 'the wand' which has taken the cartridge to a better level, black backgrounds, very little feedback or noise from the tonearm at elevated volumes etc. Thought that might interest you as you are obviously a big 1200 advocate as am I.

vinyl,3cpn2n,theabolitionist,2,Fri Jul 10 01:25:03 2015 UTC,Not much. It gets a lot of short mentions on the internet. Here's a (not very informative) TV news report about it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6a8BYVwOQs
vinyl,3cpn2n,mawnck,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:33:04 2015 UTC,Were pirated records cracked down on more in previous decades when the medium was the primary release format?
vinyl,3cpn2n,blerg34,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:50:21 2015 UTC,"Oh yes! They were still out there, but the labels were a lot more serious about putting a stop to them, at least in the US.  Pirated cassettes and 8-tracks … now those things were EVERY PLACE. Much easier to make, and harder to stop."
vinyl,3cpn2n,mawnck,2,Fri Jul 10 23:27:44 2015 UTC,"Are all of their records bootleg? Or do they just also sell bootlegs along with legitimate pressings?  I just purchased something off of them an hour ago, and would hate to find out it wasn't ""real."""
vinyl,3cpn2n,NowUSeeMeNowU,2,Thu Jul 9 20:05:31 2015 UTC,"Check out Discogs for pressing information before you buy. It sells albums that are not boots, as well. The Discogs release page makes me think it's an official pressing."

vinyl,3cpn2n,NowUSeeMeNowU,2,Fri Jul 10 03:08:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not surprised that shady plants in Czech republic are in the business of manufacturing counterfeit records.  I am surprised that supposedly reputable vendors like Turntable Lab and Waterloo Records stock all of the counterfeits they can get their hands on. Not only is it unethical and a shitty thing to do both to artists and to their own customers, but trading in counterfeit goods in interstate/international commerce is likely a federal crime with severe penalties."
vinyl,3cpn2n,dallasdude,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:44:14 2015 UTC,"Just for the record …  Just as you shouldn't call records ""vinyls"", you shouldn't call unauthorized LPs of regular albums ""bootlegs"".  A bootleg contains material that is otherwise unavailable (usually unreleased tracks or concert recordings) and makes little-to-no effort to look like a legitimate release.  What you guys are discussing here are pirated albums.  This is a bootleg."
vinyl,3cpn2n,mawnck,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:52:51 2015 UTC,"So the Kendrick - TPAB I bought on RSD that has shitty blown up graphics, no insert art, and pisspoor sound quality would be which?   It is on clear vinyl, so that's kinda cool.."
vinyl,3cpn2n,DooDooFunkenstein,2,Fri Jul 10 01:58:34 2015 UTC,"Since it's a recording that's otherwise legally available, it would just be a particularly shitty pirated album.  Why anyone would want these things is beyond me, TBH. There's no way the quality can ever be anywhere close to the legit digital releases, because the pirates don't have the masters or the original artwork, nor do they have any reason to be concerned with quality control."
vinyl,3cpn2n,mawnck,-1,Fri Jul 10 02:10:06 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, but as to the reason I bought it, they have for whatever reason decided not to issue TPAB on vinyl. The bootleg/pirate is the only version out there."
vinyl,3cpn2n,DooDooFunkenstein,5,Fri Jul 10 02:12:02 2015 UTC,"But you don't HAVE to have it on vinyl. That's the point.   Sound quality? Better in digital.  Packaging? Crap, as you said.  Supporting the artist? Nope. You're just supporting crooks.  Clear vinyl? There are lots of legit albums out there pressed on it, some very cheap.  Unless you're DJing, there's no remotely rational reason to have that album on a record. None. It's a waste of money.  And if you ARE DJ-ing, the clear vinyl makes it impossible to find the tracks, so you can cross that one off as well."
vinyl,3cpn2n,mawnck,-4,Fri Jul 10 02:18:57 2015 UTC,"You've already made your point about how you feel about the quality of the vinyl. Regardless of that, the fact remains that it is not available elsewhere on vinyl. If I wanted it on vinyl (because I am a new vinyl collector and IMO it's the best record of the year and then some), that was my only option. At that point, by your own definition, it is something only available through the bootleg version. Regardless of the quality, regardless of how you feel about it. Everything else is just, like.. your opinion, man."
vinyl,3cpn2n,DooDooFunkenstein,5,Fri Jul 10 02:26:18 2015 UTC,"No need to get defensive. It is just my opinion.   Sometimes ""what you want"" isn't available, and you just have to learn to deal with it. My opinion is you shouldn't turn to crap-quality counterfeit merchandise. Nor should you want to.  The bootleg part is not opinion, though. By definition, it's not a bootleg if the recording is readily available legally. Even if it's only on a different format."
vinyl,3cpn2n,mawnck,0,Fri Jul 10 02:58:42 2015 UTC,Definition is what I was looking for on the side of the subject of this post. I was unaware of the true definition I guess. They both kind of seem to go hand in hand with eachother though.
vinyl,3cpn2n,mawnck,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:05:46 2015 UTC,"There's definitely a gray area.   If you find a fake Beatles Christmas Album for instance, is that a counterfeit or a bootleg?

vinyl,3cpn2n,rpbtz,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:10:27 2015 UTC,The same could be said for the first Death Grips album/mixtape that I got in the mail this morning. There are legit original pressings that go for hundreds of dollars but then Vinyl-Digital had different pressings for under $30. It's not an official release of the album but would it be considered counterfeit or bootleg in the situation of the Beatles christmas album?
vinyl,3cpn2n,flockavellli,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:21:04 2015 UTC,"Just chiming in here.  Discogs provides the following approximate definitions:    Bootleg: Unauthorized recordings of live performances/broadcasts.  Counterfeit: Recordings which are copied or distributed without authority, and which are packaged to resemble the original as closely as possible.  Pirate: Recordings which are copied or distributed without authority, and which are usually packaged differently to the original.    Source - Discogs Guidelines.

An ad for the anniversary of the airline came up but I didn't see your record. Is it worth anything?  That's always the million dollar question isn't it.  Its worth what someone is willing to pay for it.  Is it in high demand?  I'd guess not, but who knows."

With stuff like this, you'll get used to it. ;-)  Don't assume the artists are obscure. Mexican record collectors wouldn't necessarily be entering their collections on an all-English website like Discogs. Google and Wikipedia would be better resources.  Timewindows has it right. There are OODLES of promotional releases like this out there, some intended for the general public, and some internally distributed to employees and salesmen and such. Their value usually depends on who's involved with the record, and whether the brand itself is collectible.  My hunch is that there aren't that many Mexicana Airlines fiends out there.

I wonder if you could get some more photos and ask what in the world is going on with that blue thing.  It has an auto-return; ask if that works.  Ask if there are any cracks in the dust cover.  Ask what cartridge it has.  Going with a cheaper table allows budget for an upgraded cartridge and/or replacement stylus.

I'm more worried about the tone of your post. There's enthusiasm, and then there's ""ok time to back away slowly"". I think you're across that line, especially if you're buying scratchy thrift store Sinatra albums. ""Addicted to vinyl"" is not a good thing to be, nor is it something to make light of. Which is why I'm posting what I'm posting. You don't want to find yourself saddled with two tons of vinyl shit. It causes problems you can't imagine.   I didn't listen to them 'digitally', but when I go to stores and see their vinyl records there, I get them immediately.   See? This isn't about the music. You're spending money to ""check out"" music you can easily check out for free online.  BE SELECTIVE. Don't buy it unless it's in excellent condition, and toss it overboard if you aren't listening to it."

Started a new and stressful job and also went back to school. Buying records was a little bit addicting and substituted for the nicotine, social life I didn't have much time for, sex, and sleep. I was collecting them faster than I could listen to them. I consistently had about 50 in a pile that needed their initial, just bought, cleaning.  I've finally cut back. Only check Goodwill or the record store every few weeks now. So it may be just an initial phase that will plateau out. But if it continues to grow find a way to step back."

Some services exist where you send in the cartridge and they refit it but it's cost prohibitive. The money that you'll invest would be better spent in a different turntable.

Cartridges (be they original or custom made) usually go for around $200 alone - which should be plenty to buy you a decent used turntable from most other brands.  The Beogram 8000 is a badass looking table, though. But it seems like you'll need a MMC 20CL, which is a fairly uncommon cartridge so not that easy to come across. The cheapest Soundsmith newly-made compatible cartridge you can get for the 8000 will set you back $250."

If you have a car or want to use the Sunrail train to get to Sandford you can try Rabbitfoot Records.

vinyl,3cm6wn,bear_claw76,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:52:52 2015 UTC,"Had to show off today's haul of jazz LPs. Someone came in with a monster collection that got put out today. The haul includes:   Giant Steps - John Coltrane My Favorite Things - John Coltrane Coltrane Jazz - John Coltrane Coltrane's Sound - John Coltrane Live at the Village Vanguard - John Coltrane The Rumproller - Lee Morgan A Date With Lee Morgan - Lee Morgan (rare) Dig - Miles Davis (Prestige/Milestones compilation, not the original release) Four and More - Miles Davis Sextant - Herbie Hancock Inception - McCoy Tyner Out Front - Booker Little Sonny Fortune ‎– Sonny Fortune (not pictured)   Most of them appear (at first glance) to be 70s pressings, though The Rumproller might be an original, and the rare Lee Morgan, the Booker, and the Sonny Fortune are probably the only pressings released.  There were many more gems in there, but I couldn't buy them all. The jackets are/were all on the mildewy side so that dissuaded me from some that were worse off. But the ones I bought cleaned up pretty well. They're all spin cleaned now and so far the vinyl all sounds great."
vinyl,3cog38,dblester,6,Thu Jul 9 14:18:50 2015 UTC,Are you using distilled water and are the towels clean? Also don't use towels dried with dryer sheets. The dryer sheets may leave a residue on the towels.
vinyl,3cog38,TheBobby_Digital,2,Thu Jul 9 14:33:05 2015 UTC,"I was not using distilled water, it was filtered water. I will try that."
vinyl,3cog38,abronia,3,Thu Jul 9 14:46:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, try using distilled water; they should sound much better afterwards.    Also, I actually just use Viva paper towels to dry the records after I run them through my Spin Clean.  It works great and you don't have to worry about having clean towels.  I just wipe them down clockwise."
vinyl,3cog38,abronia,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:16:08 2015 UTC,I'm not the only one that uses Viva.
vinyl,3cog38,barnfry,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:22:56 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of potential pitfalls when it comes to cleaning records, and making records sound worse is quite common, although not very many people like to talk about it, after spending money and time toiling over something.  The idea is to wind up with a groove that's cleaner than you started out with - the 'surface' of the record isn't what gets played, but what most people concentrate on cleaning, because it's visible.  Any time you're using any kind of fluid, you run a risk of having dry dust turn into wet mud, which could dry in the grooves leaving you with dried cement, which is worse than what you started with.   There is no manual method - brushes, towels, coffee filters, microfiber cloth, etc, which can get inside the groove and extract that  dirty fluid. In fact, the capillary effect of the groove pulls the fluid down and holds it.  So there are only two basic things you can do to limit the impact of that: You can vacuum up the dirty fluid, or you can use such a high volume of fluid that the dirt is at a very low concentration, so when it evaporates in the groove, there's relatively less dirt left. In order for that to work, you've got to get the dirt separated from the record. The ultrasonic cleaners do a great job of that, and use a huge bath, so when the record is extracted it can air dry and be in good condition. With a spin clean you just can't get as good of an effect, but you will certainly want to take care at each step to ensure you're getting the best impact possible. I don't see how manually drying a record can do any good at all - for me it's a vacuum or don't bother."
vinyl,3cog38,LionsMouth,4,Thu Jul 9 17:17:16 2015 UTC,"I have cleaned around 400 records with my Spin Clean.  My advice:   1) Really dirty records need to be pre-cleaned. I recommend a pressure pump sprayer full of distilled water with dent pullers as label protectors. Other label protector devices sold on eBay if you want those. Most of my records are either new or used for used record shops, so they're not caked with filth like stuff you see at Goodwill and Thriftshops. 2) Distilled or purified water only. Do not use anything that indicates ""minerals were added for taste"". Distilled water is really the way to go. 3) Spin Clean says you can clean 50 records or something, but I never do that. Usually I clean no more than 10-15 records before dumping the water and starting over. When I change the water, and when I'm done using it for the day, I clean the pads with warm water and clear liquid hand soap.  4) All records get air dried on a rack. I let them dry for 1.5-2 hours, sometimes longer. I never use microfiber cloths or the Spin Clean cloths to dry records. If after air drying there a a couple drops of water on the record, I dab it away with a clean microfiber cloth. Usually there is very little left after letting the record air dry. Aggressively wiping with microfiber is likely going to lead to fibers shedding on your records, particularly around the lead in groove, which will in turn create noise and build up on your stylus. I only use them as little as possible.    Follow these directions and the Spin Clean should give you good results."
vinyl,3cog38,blerg34,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:29:28 2015 UTC,"Good list. Also, before the first time you use it and after each use you're supposed to pre-clean the brushes. I've heard of this solving people's spinclean noise problem as well."

vinyl,3cog38,UnhipGlint,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:03:28 2015 UTC,How do you prevent water/solution from running onto the label if you don't dry it at all?
vinyl,3cog38,LionsMouth,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:15:16 2015 UTC,Never been an issue. I shake the water off gently over the spin clean bath before putting it on the drying rack. Never had a label get damaged at all.
vinyl,3cog38,gtfokenny,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:03:16 2015 UTC,"I am not sure how many records it would be until you need to replace the water/liquid, but that might be it?  after 25 records, that water must be grimy and disgusting and you're just running dirt and grime through your records after a couple cleans.

There's a good video on YouTube that demonstrates the production process. It's a bit like the guy that managed to put some grooves on a tortilla a few days ago: you'll be able to press some music in the tortilla, but the material the tortilla is made of doesn't lend itself for the purpose too well, so the quality of the sound will not be on par with a regular vinyl record.

vinyl,3cnha0,thievedrelic,6,Thu Jul 9 08:37:01 2015 UTC,"Deny, there is no difference in the mastering than there would be for any other record, although a shallow/thin cut would sound exponentially worse on a picture disc than on a standard pressing. It comes down to different materials used - the clear top layer is not as of a high quality as vinyl usually used for record production- it's more akin to what they make coke bottles out of. The different production process accounts for some difference too.   On any record, even ""deep"" grooves are fairly shallow. You can only cut so deep before your LPI is unreasonably low, or even worse - you end up hitting metal. Then you're out of a cutting stylus.  At their worst, picture discs can sound quite horrid, and can be unlistenable. That's not to say there aren't some that are just as good as any other record. The bad thing is you really have no way of telling without actually playing a record, but I do believe it is possible to have an audiophile-grade picture disc if care is taken in it's production. I have some which I listen to happily and I would never know if my eyes were closed. And then I have some which I will never even bother to try playing again.  With all that said, while there is no difference in mastering based on what type of record it would be pressed as - when producing a picture disc, you should be smart about what you're cutting and fight against the higher s/n  - they do tend to have a certain rumble to them due to the non-uniform surfaces. So, would you press a super quiet 25+ minute classical movement to a picture disc? I sure hope not. But you could probably get away with a Pop/rock record, especially if the sides are somewhat short and you had it cut loudly."

After having a listen, I can really say that I agree! This feels so different from other Beatles' work, and still sounds great. Besides the music, just the look of the album, including the sweet cut-outs, and the theme of this fictional band really draw me in. This is seriously my favorite album in a long time!"

Revolver I haven't listened to yet (haven't gotten around to cleaning it yet), but I've heard it's a good one and have high hopes for it. I'm more of a fan of their earlier stuff (Revolver and anything before, think less of ""She's Leaving Home"" and more of ""Day Tripper""). That being said though, Magical Mystery Tour is one of my faves, White Album and Sgt Pepper are also pretty great, and the last two aren't bad, just not my favorites."

UK Parlophone Pepper I can compare to, as I can rip records from my stereo.  The record was graded G by the seller, he said it plays better than it looks leaving me to believe it needs to be cleaned with Titebond II or something."
vinyl,3cmclt,MrRom92,2,Thu Jul 9 03:50:38 2015 UTC,"Definitely would be worth a shot. The south african beatles records, in the 60's at least, were pressed on thiiiick slabs of this really resilient stuff, and it tends to be able to take a beating and still sound great.

Let's see if I can refresh my memory… they have pcsj or pmcj cat numbers if I remember correctly. For the ones from tape copies I recall YEEX matrix for stereo and monos had XEX but no number designated cut number  I went through a bit where I tried to collect a Beatles record from every continent, then that turned into trying for every country :P but I mainly tried to stick with pressings that were sonically identical to their UK counterparts (EMI supplied metal)"

vinyl,3cmclt,MrRom92,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:07:34 2015 UTC,"Once I heard pepper in Mono I couldn't go back. I do enjoy the stereo for some of the catalogue but pepper is one case where the mono mix is clearly superior, imo, at least. as sweet as my first press stereo does sound - it doesn't hold a candle to my first press mono!  Revolver is one of those ones that's a tossup, I do enjoy both mixes and don't think that one is clearly superior over the other for the entirety of the album. Different but both are pleasant. My mono is one with the 606-1 matrix on side 2 - the true (quickly withdrawn) first press, accidentally mastered with the alternate mix of Tomorrow Never Knows, which hasn't appeared on any other release since!"

For the time I spent with them, they weren't overly grating, but (as mentioned in the article) long listening periods is where fatigue sets in. I think it's a common complaint about Klipsch horns is that they do becoming fatiguing over extended listening. I also think that component matching is an important part of the puzzle. Until recently, I was using a nice, modern Marantz receiver, which tended to accentuate the high-end a bit. Now I've got a Nakamichi project receiver I'm using. It's a little more balanced (or balanced in a different way) and I'm wondering if the Klipsch would be a good match.

At an affordable cost you're left with three options: the M95ED made by Pfanstiehl and Jico, and the M95EJ made by Jico. Of those, the Jico M95ED would be the best choice. Under $20 on the bay.  The brand says ""Electro Voice"", but they just buy in bulk (like ridiculous amounts of styli) from Jico and repackage them. The dot on the cantilever is a dead giveaway that it's Jico made.

Jico is one of the better aftermarket stylus manufacturers, plus their styli for Shure cartridges are well regarded. I've used a Jico M91ED stylus before and would recommend it.  I would recommend the Jico M95ED stylus for its low price, good quality, and ease of set up. When that wears out, moving to one of the upgrade styli for the M95 will provide a significant improvement in sound quality.

All other records in the store are 50¢.   Granted, the store owners have no idea what they are doing when it comes to records.

All of the other Beatles albums are normal prices, but for some reason this one is insanity.  Also, the thrift store where I work currently has a copy of ""Off The Wall"" with a torn apart sleeve that is so busted it just folds open like a book, and the record is scratched up and dirt caked. The regular flat rate for records is a buck but it's marked up to a few bucks. Any other recognizable records get marked up too.

vinyl,3cldr9,longhornfan3913,9,Wed Jul 8 20:30:12 2015 UTC,"Definitely a better start than a suitcase player or something!  There's a mod for the 120 that involves removing the phono preamp to improve the sound quality of it.    I'd say instead of fancier powered speakers, a decent second-hand 70s/80s/90s receiver/integrated amp w/ a built-in phono stage and some good second-hand passive bookshelf speakers would be a great way to get much improved sound quality for little $$$.  Then do the phono preamp bypass on the AT and you'll be in business!"

It seemed like a great starter table to begin with. I like how it comes with an internal phono preamp, something else I don't have to buy separate. I'm just using some old computer speakers right now (I know) because that's all I had. I'll focus on speakers next, just wanted to get the table down first. My first record is an original Boston Don't Look Back. Who doesn't love Boston? I have to say the table sounds great! Quite satisfied and can't wait to upgrade speakers.

A Very Good Plus record will show some signs that it was played and otherwise handled by a previous owner who took good care of it. Record surfaces may show some signs of wear and may have slight scuffs or very light scratches that don't affect one's listening experiences. Slight warps that do not affect the sound are ""OK"". The label may have some ring wear or discoloration, but it should be barely noticeable. The center hole will not have been misshapen by repeated play. Picture sleeves and LP inner sleeves will have some slight wear, lightly turned up corners, or a slight seam split. An LP cover may have slight signs of wear also and may be marred by a cut-out hole, indentation or corner indicating it was taken out of print and sold at a discount. In general, if not for a couple things wrong with it, this would be Near Mint. All but the most mint-crazy collectors will find a Very Good Plus record highly acceptable.""  TL;DR: still very good to play and enjoy, but can have some minor scratches / grime / wear resulting in a lower value for collectors.    Edit: I do however agree with the other comments that it also depends on the seller how these abbreviations are used."

The tonearm on the DC allows for easy upgradability, the Uturn will require you to put on washers/extra weight if you opt for a heavier cart. The motor is more stable (better wow/flutter). But this is all to be expected considering the price difference.   I am by no means saying the Uturn is bad, it's great, but you're getting a superior product with the ProJect, hence the price difference."
vinyl,3cn3d5,the_yetimonster,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:05:30 2015 UTC,"Sounds good to me.  Thanks for the tip.    Now the other question - will this be a worthwhile upgrade from my current TT?  I was looking at it and I'd be spending $100 on a new cart for my Technics anyways.  Why not upgrade to a better table?  Unless the Debut Carbon DC isn't an upgrade at all, that is."

vinyl,3clzyw,hlazlo,2,Wed Jul 8 23:15:25 2015 UTC,"It's probably the worst setup ever, but it's playing a record and so that makes me happy.     Stanton T.52 ($20 from Craigslist) Pyle PP999 Phono Pre-Amp ($16.01 from Amazon) Dayton Audio B652 speakers ($42.50 from Amazon) Lepai LP-2020A+ Amp ($33.50 from Amazon) The Doors - The Doors ($13.99 from Princeton Record Exchange)   Not the best setup, but it's playing music.  I can't stand the turntable.  It's clearly for DJing and seems to skip when we walk near it.  I plan to save up for a U-Turn Basic."
vinyl,3clzyw,MrRom92,3,Wed Jul 8 23:17:58 2015 UTC,"It's not terrible. It's certainly adequate and for $20 I'd say you did well to make a first step. The real limiting factor on it is the tonearm, and what styli you are limited to using on it. So there's really little room for upgrades in the future without chucking out the table entirely, whereas on a more traditionally designed table there is some room to grow over the years should you ever feel the need.   As for the skipping - assuming you've aligned and calibrated everything to the best of your abilities, turntables and springy wooden floors are notorious for not getting along well. If you could find some way to isolate the turntable, such as a platform underneath it, or maybe even something you could mount to the wall, you will solve that problem. That's what I'd recommend taking care of ASAP."
vinyl,3clzyw,adayinalife,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:33:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply!  I don't mean to complain excessively about my setup since it is working, but the turnable will be the first to go.  What do you mean by platform?  That might be doable."
vinyl,3clzyw,MrRom92,2,Wed Jul 8 23:35:30 2015 UTC,"If you want to do it on the cheap, get some squash balls, cut them in half, place a solid slab of wood/stone over it and place your turntable on it."
vinyl,3clzyw,Xpress_interest,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:54:57 2015 UTC,"It doesn't have to be elaborate. There are purpose-built things for the job but something as simple as a slab of concrete could be enough to do the trick for you. There are also special feet you could rest the turntable on, rubber tubes, etc.  anything to prevent the energy from the floor transferring to the tonearm."
vinyl,3clzyw,mcjones123,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:19:34 2015 UTC,"Four hockey pucks is a good dampener too - anything to isolate the turntable from vibration. Rubber is cheap and effective. Also, cut a hole slightly smaller than the spindle (the thing the record gets put on) of the turntable through the middle of a hockey puck and you've got a decent record clamp for stabilizing the record on the platter. Hockey pucks everywhere!!!"
vinyl,3clzyw,randye,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:57:06 2015 UTC,"As others have suggested isolating the table from the floor will help with the skipping, but you can also try to place the turntable in a corner of the room, where the floor probably will be more solid."
vinyl,3cmogy,Littlejth,3,Thu Jul 9 02:32:17 2015 UTC,"For 45 bucks it would be worth it. BUT there isn't much on the turntable. Ask the seller if he has the manual? Also ask if you can test it out there. I can't tell if it's a manual or an automatic, belt or direct drive, etc. But if it's all in working order, by all means."
vinyl,3cmogy,itisrocketscience,2,Thu Jul 9 03:01:38 2015 UTC,"I'll check and see if he does and if it's possible to test it. I believe it's an automatic belt drive table, based on the few things I found on it online."

Don't get me wrong, there was a time when I thought about buying a Debut Carbon Esprit SB (DC) myself but then I started researching a bit more and changed my decision in the end because I couldn't justify dropping more money for a table that performs worse.  Personally I'd rather have a sturdy table that runs like a tank for basically the rest of my life than a table which weighs not even half of mine, has less features and don't get me started on wow & flutter. Just to have a comparison, wow & flutter of my table is 0,025%.  U-Turn Orbit Basic? 0,175%  U-Turn Orbit Plus? 0,125%  Pro-Ject Essential II? 0,12%  Pro-Ject Debut Carbon Esprit SB (DC)? 0,10%  To what extent wow and flutter becomes a problem is the subject of some debate, so the performance of the worst turntables may in fact be totally acceptable to most.

This is important because, city of origin aside, much of their best work was written and performed in Paris.  Les Stances a Sophie actually has a compelling story. This album was commissioned as the soundtrack for a French New Wave film of the same name -- while the band only had two weeks left on their French visas.   The music was actually never used in the film, and the film itself has drifted into obscurity with nary a mention on iMDB.   Its discarded soundtrack, on the other hand? One of the great albums of modern jazz, and a landmark in funk, fusion, and the avant-garde.  This album features the classic quintet along with soulful vocals of Fontella Bass (of ""Rescue Me"" fame).   My copy was re-issued by Universal Sound in 2000. I will give you the review next week!"

I'm assuming the 'certain volume level' is loud.  Check here for some cheap receivers. I personally think the Onkyo 8020 is a seriously under-rated entry-level receiver.

vinyl,3ckizo,LaserRanger,2,Wed Jul 8 17:06:28 2015 UTC,Sounds like the protection relay is doing its job.  But that would mean an issue in the power amp.  What is the model?

Roommate had it and gave it to me, will be upgrading sometime soon.  So far it sounds great. A lot better than the huge Sony stereo setup from the 80's at my parents house.  Eventually, I will want to upgrade to the acrylic platter, and get a arm lever so I don't have to manually lift and drop the arm every time. I also need to pick up a brush. I have a 45 adapter coming in the mail. Other than that, I'm pretty much all set. I spent many hours last night just listening to music and adding my collection to Discogs.

vinyl,3cfpwa,BoC_JiM,8,Tue Jul 7 16:01:25 2015 UTC,"It's not a volume issue.  Records are a stereo format, and that requires two speakers. If you only have one channel hooked up, then you aren't hearing anything that was exclusive to the other channel. In extreme cases, you'll lose important things. Like, say, lead vocals."
vinyl,3cfpwa,BoC_JiM,2,Tue Jul 7 16:06:52 2015 UTC,"I totally get that. It's like when one side of your headphone goes out and you're only hearing a portion of the music. I have lots of music where the guitars change channels and switch back and forth. My ears are definitely privy to that. But I'm pretty sure this speaker covers both. I listened to about 10 LPs last night, of music I'm very familiar with, and nothing sounded missing at all.  Here are the tech specs of the speaker if you're not familiar with it."
vinyl,3cfpwa,serialaccountkiller,6,Tue Jul 7 16:14:33 2015 UTC,"Here are the tech specs of the speaker   Ah, it IS a stereo speaker in a single box. TIL.  I still don't necessarily approve - you aren't getting much separation with the elements that close together - but at least you aren't losing anything. It'll do for now.  I would suggest not having it on the same surface as the TT itself. Vibrations from the speaker can feed back into the cartridge and muddy the sound."
vinyl,3cfpwa,hendrixfreak,2,Tue Jul 7 16:19:57 2015 UTC,"Sounds good! Right now, I'm pretty limited on space. But maybe I can buy a side stand or something in the future for the speaker.

On that note, I know everyone loves used TTs and speakers because they tend to be well-built and simple to repair if necessary - but what's the prevailing wisdom on used receivers? It seems to my admittedly uneducated brain that receivers contain so many different pieces that they would be more prone to going kaput."
vinyl,3chk8p,Stevenwithavee,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:28:06 2015 UTC,"lol simple to repair. Wish that was the case. Anyhow, people are gonna say buy used because say you have $300 to spend you are more likely to get gear with better sound quality used for that money vs. buying $300 worth of new gear. Now that may be true but you also have to factor in this gear is 30-50 years old so there are going to be some speed bumps. My rule of thumb is, if you buy used gear, expect for it to break down and if you aren't knowledgeable about how to fix it expect to pay at least $150 for whatever the repair is. I say that because usually most shops its $40-60 deposit and then whatever the parts cost and the labor which is the biggest cost."

vinyl,3chbm0,LordVinyl,-1,Tue Jul 7 22:24:58 2015 UTC,"I can't hear the difference between streaming, mp3, cd or vinyl (well, maybe streaming is pretty easy to hear the diff). But I love the novelty and make it a habit to listen to a few LPs each week (I have ~400 vinyls collected!). Vinyl forces me to focus on the music and not get distracted like mp3s would as I work on my computer.    I'm also your typical ""collector."" I get hung up on having complete sets of things...from baseball cards, comic books, DVDs...I grew up collecting ""stuff."" Now I like completing my favorite band's discographies on vinyl. Plus, the bigger format of the physical content vs. CDs is a huge draw for me, too.    I'm really proud of my collection and I want to be that dad, or uncle or whatever that's known as the guy with awesome music taste for my friends and family to discover!"
vinyl,3chbm0,whyaduck,4,Tue Jul 7 22:34:09 2015 UTC,"Of the 3 sources you mention, I think vinyl records would be the easiest to identify unless the source you're streaming from is miserable.  As far as the near disposability of streaming/digital music, I find it's related to where and how I'm playing it. At work in the cubicle jungle it's usually there to help me concentrate.  In my bedroom it's a soporific or background in the morning...and at other times.  In my listening room, played through a high quality DAC, it definitely holds my attention."
vinyl,3chbm0,mawnck,0,Wed Jul 8 06:41:22 2015 UTC,"To you vinyl is easier to identify, but my hearing is...well...kinda shit lol - so the audio quality listening experience isn't as valuable to me as it is to you or others. In no way was my comment mean to suggest that those listening platforms are equal."

I'm kind of the same way, I have music playing constantly in my house via Spotify, and it's background music for the most part.  When I listen to records I actually set aside time to veg out, lay on the couch, and just listen to the music and nothing else. At least that's my take on it."

vinyl,3citqa,adayinalife,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:49:18 2015 UTC,I second this. SL1600 is automatic and therefore it is not suitable for DJing.  It has the same engine as the SL1200 (DJ-Icon) but Technics made the 1600-1800 line so people can enjoy the music at home.
vinyl,3citqa,adayinalife,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:55:16 2015 UTC,"It's not quite the same as the 1200 (it's slightly older).  The 1600-1800MK2 has the same tonearm as the 1200MK2 though.  Possibly the same DD motor.  But the 1600-1800MK1 aren't the same.  However, I mainly suggested the LP120 because I hate to see people clowning around DJing with good vintage tables."
vinyl,3ci29y,iliketunamelts,3,Wed Jul 8 01:59:03 2015 UTC,"You need a 78 stylus. They can be hissy normally, especially if abused, but when you have a stylus that's nearly 4 times too small bouncing around in the groove and riding the bottom where all the metal shavings are, they sound exponentially worse. Not to mention it will wreck your normal stylus.   Here's what you want to do. You'll want to get a dedicated 78 cartridge mounted and aligned on a separate headshell. That way when you want to play those discs, you'll only have to swap out headshells (takes all of 5 seconds) and reset the tracking force.  If you're crafty, you can even cut out the last step - you'll want to pack some weight onto the 78 headshell, measuring carefully - just enough so that it happens to be tracking at the proper force at the same placement of the counterweight - meaning you never have to touch it and only have to swap the headshell from one to the other, and you'd be good to go.  As for cleaning, this isn't true for all discs, but for the majority of shellac - water is the best thing you can use. Alcohol, while safe on vinyl, will eat away at the shellac and cause it to disintegrate. I learned this the hard way."
vinyl,3ci29y,MrRom92,5,Wed Jul 8 02:34:06 2015 UTC,"Also, NO woodglue. That will bind with the record and destroy it."

vinyl,3ci29y,MrRom92,2,Thu Jul 9 02:36:27 2015 UTC,"I feel like getting the 78 headshell + adding weight so all I have to do whenever I wanna play a 78 is swap out headshells is going to be my attack plan. A much easier/affordable/space-efficient alternative to getting a dedicated player just for 78s.  If I've learned anything after having picked up these records on a impulse purchase whim, it's that 78s are a whole 'nother animal."
vinyl,3ci29y,adayinalife,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:35:16 2015 UTC,"That much is certain. They're extremely fun to get into though, for those who can. Not only wildly fascinating from a historical context, but you'd be surprised how good they can sound. And if you're into music from before the 50's, when everything was still cut to disc and not tape, you can't beat the originals for authenticity or sound quality - any CDs/LPs you'd find of the recordings would only be dubs of the actual 78rpm records anyway!"
vinyl,3ci29y,adayinalife,2,Thu Jul 9 03:37:06 2015 UTC,"Also, am I okay to play the 78s off my LP120 (using the stock stylus) without damaging the TT/needle or the records?   No, you need a 78 specific stylus. The wider grooves of the 78 will cause your needle to bounce around in the groove damaging both needle and record."
vinyl,3ci29y,UpgradeTech,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:18:37 2015 UTC,"Do you have any recommendations? The only one I've found thus far that I'd seriously consider is the Shure M78S, but even that might be a touch out of my price range if I'm also going to be in the market to get a new headshell."

When I press that submit button I tell myself this is a donation and anything I get back in the mail is a bonus. Here's what I'd do. Order the one on ebay then wait till the other comes in the mail. At this point you'll have the 3rd and 4th pressing. If you can put those next to the 1st and 2nd on the 27th day of June 2016 at precisely 12:01AM a clone of LUM will spawn and begin producing more music. It's a long shot but definitely worth a try. In all seriousness, I'd just but the ebay copy and maybe sell the 4th pressing. Personally, I'd keep both because LUM is worth it."

vinyl,3cgufk,pds828,3,Tue Jul 7 20:31:38 2015 UTC,maybe with todays technology we can develop a way that can fit more on one disc without sacrificing quality   The trend is to put on less music per side these days to satisfy the accounting department.
vinyl,3cgufk,LaserRanger,3,Tue Jul 7 20:59:53 2015 UTC,"The issue is that the music actually takes physical space on the disc. You can crush the dynamics but that doesn't make for a good listening experience. Vinyl, realistically speaking, has reached it's a apex of quality - in fact it's only gotten worse since the revival due to people looking to take shortcuts rather than improve or at least maintain the quality of the final product.  technology has been developed and has already been in widespread use since the 1960's - disc cutting computers, which analyze the signal being cut before it is actually cut, and by ""thinking ahead"" - they can automatically adjust the pitch and depth of the cut, so that each revolution of the groove can be packed tighter and closer to the one before it without actually running back into it. They get to ""see ahead"" into the audio by the use of a special preview head on the tape machine - or, worst case scenario, an ill equipped tape machine with a digital delay.   The most advanced one was found in the Neumann vms 82. I'm sure with today's technology it could be improved and we could get the grooves to hug a bit more without issue, but what would the gains be? Another minute or two of playing time? Sides are generally kept short enough that this is never an issue and can be cut with reasonable level and dynamic range intact. I think it'd be cool, but who's investing in the R&D?"

vinyl,3cgufk,badcrass,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:20:47 2015 UTC,"The problem with developing better ways of pressing vinyl is simple. It requires money. The reason why companies aren't investing in improving vinyl is the same reason new pressing plants are sprouting up all over th e place. The problem is that vinyl is still seen as a fad by the major record companies. Which it is. Vinyl still equates to less than 5% ( only a rough guess) of the entire profits of the music industry. Why would these companies invest in something that will disappear into relative obscurity in a decades time. Now if vinyl is around still by the next decade, then we may see investment into improving vinyl production. Until then, vinyl is going to stay as it is."

I don't abandon posts - I always like to engage with folks in the comments about something I'm passionate about, and I could talk about The Band all day!"
vinyl,3cbxlk,Lor_Enzo,16,Mon Jul 6 20:02:47 2015 UTC,"My dad gave me Rock of Ages on CD when I was a freshman in high school because I really liked Up on Cripple Creek, didn't really think much of the album until I was a senior in high school walking through an area of woods that were all old growth pine trees and the song King Harvest (Has Surely Come) came up on my iPod and for whatever reason it just clicked with me.   My dad noticed that I was playing a lot of The Band and said that he had Rock of Ages on vinyl and that we should throw it on his old turntable that up to this point had sat in the living room unused for 10+ years. Turns out he had a pretty stellar collection of vinyl and once we started to play other albums it re-sparked his, and initiated, my passion for vinyl. I have that copy of Rock of Ages now and it's one of my most prized records/possessions (the other is his copy of George Harrison's All Things Must Pass which my dad listened to while fighting in Vietnam (talk about adding emotional weight). Rock of Ages is so important as it was really the first time my dad and I bonded over a band and our musical paths met.   Time went on and I moved to college, taking with me the music of The Band digitally on my iPod. I bought my first record player as a sophomore in college and played Rock of Ages throughout most of my sophomore year with a bong in hand. My really good friend had an older brother who went to college 45 minutes east of me and suggested we meet up at his house to party for the long weekend. Those nights were filled with underage drinking, eating shit tons of pizza and smoking inordinate amounts of pot. However, no matter what level of twisted we were, at the end of the night someone would always manage to put on the DVD version of the Last Waltz. This late night showing of the Last Waltz would draw up the guys who lived in the apartments throughout the house (3 floors with 3 separate apartments) who would drag chairs from around the apartment to get a spot in front of the TV. Whoever was still awake by the end of the DVD when Pops Staples would appear with his daughters to sing a redo of The Weight would make sure to put the 3 foot bong called Excalibur back in its velour lined carrying case.  Junior year brings me some extra disposable income and I meet up with my sister in Las Vegas to do a road trip around the American Southwest for spring break. With my turn to pick music to listen to I put on The Big Chill Soundtrack which has The Weight on it. Boom, right from those opening chords and driving across the wide open expanses of southern Utah I'm instantly transported to that scene from Easy Rider. The feeling of being on the open road with no where to be and no one telling you what to do was pure freedom. The Weight itself always seems to end up on a playlist of some kind whenever there's a gathering of friends and probably has more layers of social meaning to me than any other song out there.  Come the spring of 2010 I see Levon is playing at Newport Folk Festival in Newport, RI. I called up my buddies mentioned from sophomore year and we buy tickets right when they go on sale. I've gone to the Newport Folk Festival every summer since and it's become a touchstone with my friends who make the trek back each July even though we're spread across the country.  It was my first music festival which opened my eyes to others like Bonnaroo and Sasquatch! All of this started me with seeing Levon's name on the bill.  Two years ago I moved across the country with my girlfriend to start a new life. Leaving my family behind and with my girlfriend asleep in the car I toss on Music From Big Pink while I'm driving through the Berkshires of western Massachusetts at dawn. Right when I Shall Be Released comes on and Richard Manuel hits that first note my eyes well up (not Tears of Rage though rim shot) and it really sinks in what I'm leaving behind.  Happy to say things have been incredible out here in WA and I just spent the holiday weekend with both my folks and we had the turntable going all weekend (recent additions of Gary Clark Jr Live and My Morning Jacket's The Waterfall). I made sure to throw on my dad's copy of Rock of Ages for old time's sake.   Awesome collection too, have all of them (multiple copies of The Last Waltz as I seem to always come across them at yard sales and can't say no) except those Basement Tapes and the final six that are Levon, Neil Young, etc.  Thanks for sharing /u/kedrico!  tl;dr emotionally invested in The Band"

It's super cool!  You might be into The Cate Brothers as well, Their drummer, Terry Cagle, is Levon Helm's nephew and he talks about them in his autobiography, This Wheel's On Fire. The Cates are two twins that play guitar and piano, they had a brief run on a few major labels including an Austin City Limits appearance in the 70's.  Ernie & Earl Cate then both joined The Band for a time to tour when they reunited in the 80's after Robbie Robertson left. Their earliest record in particular The Cates Gang - Wanted - you would probably dig it a lot as it is stylistically very Bandesque although the outlaw gang metaphor is quaint."

vinyl,3cbxlk,JerryAtricks,3,Tue Jul 7 03:42:12 2015 UTC,"Awesome Collection.    Things you should look into:   The Basement Tapes Raw Sounds much better than the original release.  No overdubs from Robbie.  No songs that weren't recorded during those sessions.  And so many more songs from the original sessions. Eric Clapton - No Reason to Cry The album was recorded at The Band's Shangri-la Studios in March 1976, and all five 'The Band' members play on the album. Neil Young - Hawks and Doves First off, On the Beach is possibly my favorite album of all time.  And Neil is probably my favorite artist.  So I would suggest checking out everything he did from '68 - '79. But if you're looking for The Band members, you should check out Hawks and Doves.  'The Old Homestead' features Levon on drums which clocks in at over 7 mins.  It's one of my favorite NY songs, and partly because of Levon's funky galloping beat that doesn't overpower the acoustic guitar Neil is laying down.  Completely underrated album and you get 7 1/2 minutes of Levon."

But unless this guy's found a truly unique implementation, that patent shouldn't stand up in any court.   The problem with these inexpensive rail designs is that they're noisy, and I don't see any evidence that he's solved that problem. But the internet's gonna internet.  Linear tracking has been around as long as records have. Literally. Edison's very first tin foil phonograph was a linear tracker.  Also, the crazy VTA in those photos is going to cause WAY more distortion than the linear tracking is going to solve. I don't think he knows what he's doing."
vinyl,3cf11o,mawnck,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:44:37 2015 UTC,I think the VTA may just be an optical illusion

vinyl,3ccwgi,BriMarsh,8,Mon Jul 6 22:50:35 2015 UTC,"Full Album: http://imgur.com/a/Uwawu  I was excited beyond reasonable levels when I came across this at a garage sale this weekend.   Grabbed a Technics DL-D202 Turntable and a Sony STR- D650Z Stereo.  The turntable is in unbelievable condition and includes the original manual.  This will be replacing my extremely basic Akai turntable.   It's got all the fancy features that I've ever wanted!  I struck up a conversation with the owner.   It was originally her father's and she was selling off some of his belongings after he had passed.   I asked if she had any other equipment that went with the TT and she was kind enough to invite me in to her house to look.  I found a very heavy Sony stereo that wasn't being used and bundled it together with the TT for $70 total.   I'm fairly new to the hobby, but I guesstimate the total value to be around $250?  I'd love to hear your thoughts on my evaluation.  I know a lot of the value may depend on the stylus.   Anyone know if the Empire cartridge is any good?  If it's trash, any recommendations on replacing it?   Thanks for looking and sharing in my joy!"
vinyl,3ccwgi,dftba171,5,Mon Jul 6 22:59:35 2015 UTC,"Eh, the value of the bundle is worth about that. You got a good deal, the turntable is in really good condition. The empire stylus looks like the one the TT came with, so try to replace the stylus as fast as you can really, as it can create inner groove distortion and just overall lower quality than if you got a new stylus. The turntable is in really good condition, so you got a good deal on that. The receiver is findable for around 5 dollars at a goodwill. Its a 80s sony black plastic receiver, so it'll work well, but its not a great receiver.  Good finds though!"
vinyl,3ccwgi,LaserRanger,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:08:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your contribution!  I'll look for a new stylus right away.   Have any recommendations on choosing the right one?   The stereo surprised me a bit, because the model number pulls up a manufactured date of 1996 and 120w per channel .  I'm a fan that it has a Phono input.  The weight of it is also promising.  My true dream is to find a nice vintage stereo with some sexy knobs and old-school lighting."
vinyl,3ccwgi,LaserRanger,3,Tue Jul 7 00:41:04 2015 UTC,Figure out which Empire you have.  It looks like a later model.  We can guide you to a decent replacement stylus.

I got the Stanton T.62 used for free and wanted to put a new stylus on it. The 500 v.3 was discontinued a while ago so it was impossible to find anywhere other than on EBay. Ebay prices for new carts/stylus were more than I wanted to pay for a cheaper turntable. I originally tried one of the generic square looking replacement stylus for the 500.v3. It was crap. Avoid those. I eventually found a OEM stanton 520  stylus on ebay for a decent price and got that. It worked pretty well. So keep an eye out on ebay, but avoid the generic stylus. I would think about saving up for a better turntable though before spending $50-$75 on a original Stanton stylus though."

vinyl,3cg44w,CleavonLittle,2,Tue Jul 7 17:21:16 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a problem with the Pioneer TBH.   Your description is textbook for ""that's not a phono preamp"", but that Pioneer certainly has one. Is it possible you made a dumb mistake when you hooked it up the first time? (We all do stuff like that from time to time.)  If not, it might be time to have a repair shop take a look at the Pioneer. Also, if you know anyone else with a phono input on their receiver, it wouldn't hurt to try your TT on it, just to rule out that it's not the cart. Carts are pretty simple things, though … They rarely go bad.  One more thing to check is that the ground wire itself hasn't gone bad. If there's an ""air gap"" in it, it might cause the symptoms you're having.  (Oh, and also, don't EVER hook up anything to a phono preamp except a turntable. You can blow stuff out doing things like that.)"
vinyl,3cg44w,mawnck,2,Tue Jul 7 17:45:30 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your reply. I checked all my connections again. I also unplugged the RCA connectors from the ""Phono 1"" jack. The ""Phono 2"" jack had dead plugs in it with a little cardboard card behind them saying to remove them if you ever used it. So, I hooked it up to the assumed previously unused ""Phono 2"" jack with the same problem.   So, if there was a problem with the output of the Pioneer, would if affect both Phono outputs? Also, could I plug the TT into anything on my regular 5.1 receiver to check it out, or does it need to be a designated Phono out?"
vinyl,3cg44w,mawnck,2,Tue Jul 7 18:10:37 2015 UTC,"I'd say if there was a problem, it would definitely affect both phono inputs. (With the caveat that we still haven't ruled out the TT's cartridge or wiring. I just think it's more likely to be the receiver.)  You must have a phono preamp to use a TT. If your 5.1 receiver doesn't have one built-in, then plugging the TT directly into it won't do you any good. One of the purposes of the preamp is to bring the TT up to ""line level"", which is the standard level all the other inputs expect by default."
vinyl,3cg44w,mawnck,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:32:08 2015 UTC,"Ok thanks so much for all the good information. I guess my goal now is to find another tuner (should I call this a tuner? an amp?) with a phono pre-amp so that I can isolate which one it is. Is it possible that the phono pre-amp is bad but the rest of the Pioneer is working fine, hence the good sound on the aux in?  From what my noobish eyes can tell the TT just sits there and decodes the record. It either works or it doesn't, most of the time. If one of the wires was bad coming out of the back then that channel wouldn't make noise. That leaves the cartridge. Research is telling me that they usually just get gradually crappier in quality until you know to buy a new one. I guess the question is, would a failing stylus make it sound similarly to a failing (or non-existent) pre-amp?  Thanks so much - what a wonderful source of information!"
vinyl,3cg44w,mawnck,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:47:12 2015 UTC,"should I call this a tuner? an amp?   A tuner is just a radio, nothing else. The term you're looking for is ""receiver"", which is an amp and tuner combined in one box. An amplifier with a built-in phono preamp will also do, but those aren't as common. Another option - get a cheap-ass separate phono preamp like this one. Then you can hook the TT up to the preamp, then hook the preamp up to any of the inputs of the 5.1 system, and you should get decent sound. (If you're planning on doing this as a permanent solution, then I would encourage you to buy a better preamp than that piece of crap.)   Is it possible that the phono pre-amp is bad but the rest of the Pioneer is working fine, hence the good sound on the aux in?   Absolutely. The phono preamp is a separate set of electronics from the rest of the Pioneer's innards. The phono inputs are the only things that go through it. It can go toes-up while leaving everything else humming along just fine.   From what my noobish eyes can tell the TT just sits there and decodes the record. It either works or it doesn't, most of the time.   Bingo. The electro-mechanics happen inside the cartridge, converting the stylus's wiggles into a low-level electrical signal. From there it's just wires until you get to the preamp. If the cartridge's innards get corroded or otherwise damaged, then bad things can happen to the sound, but that's kind of rare - and the bad things wouldn't generally be the loss of volume and low frequencies.   would a failing stylus make it sound similarly to a failing (or non-existent) pre-amp?   Not exactly. The stylus's purpose is to come in contact with the record and wiggle with the groove. If it isn't wiggling as well as it should (because it's worn out or damaged), the result will be fuzzier, more distorted sound and more surface noise.   The other things that can go wrong with a stylus might be worth checking into: (1) The cantilever - that's the metal stick part - gets bent or broken. That could drop your volume in addition to messing up the sound, but I don't think you'd lose your bass because of that. Make sure it's straight, and pointed straight ahead when the record is playing. (2) The stylus (point) itself gets sheared off the cantilever. That would sound dreadful, and would make little-to-no music at all, so I think you can rule that one out. (3) The rubber suspension at the back of the cantilever deteriorates to mush. Based on your symptoms, this one is slightly possible, especially if it's an ancient stylus. The only way to know is to buy a replacement stylus and try it.  I'm still going with ""dead phono preamp circuit in the Pioneer"". Your symptoms just fit that one too well. The only way to know for sure is to troubleshoot, and the only way to do that is to get access to some known-working equipment to troubleshoot with."

Thanks to you and the help of some good people in /r/vintageaudio we are all nearing the same conclusions.  To begin: a preamp is in order. Thinking about this one.  http://www.amazon.com/Behringer-PP400-BEHRINGER-MICROPHONO/dp/B000H2BC4E/  Rather than digging all the crap out of my entertainment center, I know the aux jack works on the Pioneer. I'll run the aftermarket preamp between the TT and the aux jack. This will tell me who the culprit is, at least.   If this solves the problem, can I just for giggles plug the TT into the phono 1 jack with the aftermarket preamp? Does the burned out preamp let it all pass through, or am I risking further damage? Or should I just avoid the amped phono jacks altogether with the aftermarket amp just to be safe? If so, then I guess my only other option as far as finding out what's wrong is to take it in to an expert somewhere.  Thank you so much! I didn't know about cheapo phono preamps 30 mins ago! There is light at the end of the tunnel. As much as I love to solve problems, my main problem is not listening to records, and I can devote my time and money to getting it in tip top shape at a later time."
vinyl,3cg44w,aj5dv,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:33:17 2015 UTC,"If this solves the problem, can I just for giggles plug the TT into the phono 1 jack with the aftermarket preamp?   NO! One preamp at a time! The preamp actually has two jobs - boost the overall signal level, and FIX THE EQ.   Records are cut with reduced bass and boosted treble. It saves room on the record (bass takes up more room), and improves the signal to noise ratio. The preamp undoes this adjustment (in other words, it BOOSTS the bass and CUTS the treble) so the result sounds just like the original recording.  That's why we think it's your preamp. Besides the level being too low, your bass is gone. We think that what you're hearing is what's coming straight off the cartridge - no level boost, and no EQ correction.  Plugging a phono preamp into another phono preamp is the same thing as plugging anything else line-level into a phono preamp. With the level boost plus the bass boost, you're risking an overload that can fry electronics and speakers.  In your case it probably won't do any harm, but there's absolutely no reason to take a chance. You'll feel pretty dumb if you somehow brick your nice Pioneer just to do a little experiment."

vinyl,3cg1gj,Shadow_Assailant,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:03:29 2015 UTC,"First off, take a look at the service manual. KD 2100  Starting from the easiest thing to fix, replacing RCA plugs male/femail is pretty easy. Just basic soldering skills required. I am assuming you mean the center pin on the RCA plug when you say that it snapped off in the amp. Pull them out and find any other RCA cables you have laying around and solder the new plugs in place of the old.  Does everything still move freely? This is important to determine how bad it all is. IF they still move freely, all you may need to do is turn everything until it resets. The automechanism is quite complicated but it may be easily fixed by getting the gears back into alignment and zeroed.   What are the other problems you are having with it? And can we have pictures or videos of what is and isn't working or is broken?"
vinyl,3cg1gj,itisrocketscience,2,Tue Jul 7 19:24:55 2015 UTC,"So fixing the RCA cables in the end shouldn't be too hard of a problem, then. I do have spare cables lying around.  All the mechanisms do seem to move freely. I recorded a rough video of my perceptions which I will link to as soon as it finishes uploading.   Edit: Here's the video.  In the meantime, compared to the linked service manual pdf (specifically page 3), I think the problem starts with the Turntable retainer and the clutch plate (Fig. 2 under ""PLAY Mode"" pg 3). The mechanism completes steps 1-10 in Fig. 2, but does not continue past this because the turntable receiver does not engage the clutch plate; however, if I physically raise the turntable shaft connected to the receiver, it does engage the clutch plate and then normal operation continues until the tonearm reaches the center. When this happens, I believe the clutch plate is supposed to be pushed back towards the turntable receiver (which it does), but again, the TR does not engage the CP unless I raise the turntable shaft. Once I do so, the tonearm returns to the original position and then the machine turns off.  As a side note, if I press the Play button without interfering with the mechanism, it never shuts off even though it should.  Also, if I simply move the tonearm from the resting position without pressing the Play button, the mechanism automatically turns on and will then turn off once I return it."

Their main focus was in selling their phonographs, and the African American artists they signed were simply the cheapest talent that the could find at the time to help along with selling their product.

vinyl,3cdnxa,in_my_underwear,26,Tue Jul 7 02:34:03 2015 UTC,"The uturn orbit isn't an audiophile turntable. It skipped anti skate to be cheaper. But, I do understand the questions of high end turntables like clearaudio/vpis.   Preamp- Most audiophiles will be buying a preamp separately anyways, and an audiophile grade preamp is much too big to fit in a turntable. Most turntables with a preamp are crummy preamps anyways. Automatic Operation Pitch control- The audience this is catered to doesn't care about automatic operation. Certain records can't play with an automatic operation, and manual is more free. USB interface - A turntable needs a preamp to have a USB interface for recording. Most of the usb devices are in the preamps in turntables and in standalone preamps.  Pitch control - With these high end turntables, they are engineered very specifically already to move at exactly 33 1/3 / 45 rpm. Pitch controls just aren't needed. 78 RPM- Plenty of high end turntables have 78 RPM. Specifically the audiophile entry level Clearaudio Concept. Some just skip it because MOST people don't play 78s.   Most of the features are stripped from audiophile turntables really just because audiophiles don't need it. Having more components means spending more money or sacrificing money on other components of the turntable that may be more valuable to the listener than a USB interface.

The quieter the motor is, the more consistently and accurately it turns etc the better the quality of sound that can be produced.

vinyl,3cdnxa,batnastard,2,Tue Jul 7 07:27:33 2015 UTC,There's no real innovations that happen but there is a large R&D cost in making everything as precise as possible. The R&D budget won't be as big as the new iPhone but only a few thousand turntables are expected to be sold so the price must be increased to cover the R&D and turn a profit.
vinyl,3cdnxa,damnspynovels,6,Tue Jul 7 08:00:25 2015 UTC,"There is the reality of economies of scale. In the 1970's, when vinyl was THE medium for audio playback, a company like Technics, Kenwood, Sony, etc. could design and produce a audiophile quality turntable and price it reasonably. Knowing that they were going to be able to sell x1,000 units allowed them to find a balance between price and quantity. Now, even with the vinyl resurgence, the market for turntables is astoundingly smaller. The only units that are going to sell in substantial quantity are the entry level to mid-fi units. If you are going to make your money in quantity, you need to reduce your cost per unit, by using lower-end, mass-market components in order to maximize the profit.  Once you start pushing the psychological barriers of dollar thresholds (like +$500 or +$1,000, +5,000) then your consumer base drops considerably. At that point (especially in the +$1,000 and beyond bracket) you are dealing with a different type of consumer who values different elements of the turntable over someone who is only willing to pay $200-300. Very often that person will appreciate and understand the engineering and craftsmanship that goes into a well put together piece of equipment.  There is also the element of return on investment. Outside of materials, there is the time, energy, experience and knowledge (mostly the last two) that the company or individual creating the turntable sees as a quantifiable value. The +$1,000 buyer mentioned above is usually one, who through their own life experience, understands and appreciates what it means to have a skill set and knowledge base that isn't material, but definitely valuable. That is a lot of what is being priced into audiophile level turntables. That and the limited consumer base dictates that the turntable be priced a level of profitability that will sustain the business beyond cost expenditures."
vinyl,3cdnxa,beige4ever,2,Tue Jul 7 05:42:05 2015 UTC,"Right. The flip side of this is that right now, ""audiophile"" tables are mostly made by boutique manufacturers, who focus on quality without economy of scale.

vinyl,3cddyo,Josuah,2,Tue Jul 7 06:38:40 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't recommend the Rega protractor in this case. FWIW, cartridge choice doesn't play a role in choosing a geometry model (protractor type) - It's the arm and the location of the arm relative to the spindle, which are your two constants. (Unless you've drilled holes in the plinth or arm board, or have done some other custom job, the arm position is constant for any given turntable model, and can be looked up at vinyl engine). Moving the cartridge around on the arm gives the adjustable variable that allows you to match the geometry of the protractor.  The Rega protractor is intended to give the best overall performance for any cartridge mounted on a Rega arm on a Rega turntable. In other cases there are other solutions."
vinyl,3cg39g,supersonick_95,9,Tue Jul 7 17:15:11 2015 UTC,"My advice is to not stress about stuff like this, unless it's an expensive collectable you're planning to sell.   As far as sound quality is concerned, you're dealing with way too many variables to even begin to make a generalization. Sometimes an original will sound better, sometimes the reissue will … and a lot of times it will depend on where the record was pressed. (Most record companies had several factories working on releases at the same time back in the day, distributed by region.) When you're dealing in used records, the condition will usually be more important than any other factor.  Is your ""Boy"" reissue an AAA mastering or a digital remaster? No way to tell for sure, although most pressings made since the mid-1990s have a digital step in there somewhere, which may or may not have screwed up the sound enough so you can tell it. Start googling and maybe you'll find your answer."
vinyl,3cg39g,mawnck,7,Tue Jul 7 17:22:16 2015 UTC,"I'll second this and add that priority number one is to enjoy the music!  If it sounds good to you, who cares!  The truth of the matter is that it is only when you start to upgrade your components and step up to the higher end that this kind of stuff (possibly) makes a difference in sound. I love music.  I have a lifetime of memories attached to music.  Not one of those memories cares if the music I was hearing was analog or digital."

vinyl,3cg39g,creepyrob,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:11:37 2015 UTC,"Vinyl by its nature is analog. Even albums that were digitally recorded became analog once they were pressed on vinyl (but were obviously still digital when issued on CD).   Are you sure Discogs says your version of Boy is a repress and not just a different version? A lot of albums had different versions released at the same time, e.g. the US's version of an album might have a different label or cover art from a UK version, or even just a different catalog number. A true repress usually happens years after the original release. You can find out more as you spend more time on Discogs. And being new to vinyl, chances are you will."
vinyl,3cg39g,TheJokersChild,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:30:36 2015 UTC,"Just found out by looking at the etchings on the record that I have the original US pressing. The only weird thing is, is that with the original US pressing the inner sleeve is printed on both sides, one side having the picture of the boy from the UK version and the other side having the lyrics. My record, while the serial number etchings match, the inner sleeve does not. My inner sleeve only has the lyrics on one side and is blank on the other. The only version that has the blank side of the inner sleeve is a 1980 US repressing."

vinyl,3cg39g,LaserRanger,4,Tue Jul 7 17:46:46 2015 UTC,It's also possible that Discogs has it wrong. And/or the record company ran out of first-edition inner sleeves before they ran out of first-edition vinyl.  Which is why it's best not to stress too much over these things. :-)
vinyl,3cg39g,LaserRanger,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:52:33 2015 UTC,"is it on the blue sunrise/sunset Island label?  if so, it's probably original.  they quit printing that label in the US in 1981, possibly early 82.  also: if it has a catalog number starting with ILPS, it's probably original.  That ended around the same time because (I think) they were bought by Warner Bros and used their catalog system for distribution.

vinyl,3cfmvs,TheBobby_Digital,2,Tue Jul 7 17:02:58 2015 UTC,"Most likely not.  From Wikipedia:   The plaques themselves contain various items under the glass. Modern awards often use CDs instead of records. Most gold and platinum records are actually vinyl records which have been vacuum metallized and tinted, while trimmed and plated metal ""masters"", ""mothers"", or ""stampers"" (metal parts used for pressing records out of vinyl) were initially used. Rarely does the groove on the record match the actual recording being awarded. Individual plaque-makers produced their awards according to available materials and techniques employed by their graphic arts departments. The plaques, depending on size and elaborateness of design, cost anywhere between US$135 and $275, most often ordered and purchased by the record label that issued the original recording.

vinyl,3cbg9e,MegaMuto,9,Mon Jul 6 17:32:32 2015 UTC,I keep mine with the opening on top.  Easy access and since they are stored upright the record doesn't slide out when I pull it off the shelf.

vinyl,3cbg9e,Kirky0331,3,Mon Jul 6 20:18:14 2015 UTC,"Likely because they are original pressings and/or more rare. In some cases, as with many of the Beatles' records, the albums were originally mixed in mono with the band present, while the stereo mixes were quickly cooked up after the fact."

This is my first player, a very simple and entry level type of record player. I've recently been looking at upgrading, and the one I've essentially settled on is the Audio-Technica AT-LP120. I really, really like this turntable. To me, it's professional looking, sleek, and high quality. I'm just confused on a few things:  I haven't had to buy speakers, since my Jensen came with them. But with the Audio-Technica, not only does it not come with speakers, it doesn't have built-in speakers. I don't want to play music through my computer. I'd prefer to buy speakers. However, I know the AT doesn't have the standard slots for wire-connect speakers.   My question: What would I need to buy? Auxiliary speakers? I'd like to spend between $50-$70, but still want decent quality. Any help?"
vinyl,3cbg9e,R_Kelly_Loves_Whites,6,Mon Jul 6 22:25:18 2015 UTC,First off - good choice on the LP120. It should be a massive upgrade over your Jensen table.  If you're looking to simply hook up a pair of speakers to the turntable you can buy a set of powered speakers and plug them straight into the LP120 because of its built-in preamp.  If you were to get a set of passive speakers you would need a receiver between them and the turntable.

vinyl,3cbg9e,R_Kelly_Loves_Whites,5,Tue Jul 7 01:38:30 2015 UTC,"Correct, the LP120 has a built in phono stage. So you just run the RCAs from the turntable to the speakers."

When hooked up to the receiver I am only getting the full sound on the right side of the balance, and when the cord is flipped the left side. I was told by a friend to check the needle and cartridge wiring. I haven't gotten a chance yet but is there anything else that could be wrong. I have also tried a different cable with the same results."
vinyl,3cbg9e,713Kilo,2,Thu Jul 9 15:08:52 2015 UTC,"Check if there is any corrosion on the jacks, or any disconnected wires in the TT itself. Since the SL-D30 is a P-mount table, it's unlikely that cartridge wiring is an issue, but I suppose it is plausible that the metal contacts have worn out over time. If that is the case, you could try carefully ""re-tipping"" the contacts on the tonearm with a little bit of pencil graphite (though I've never tried it on a TT before). Seriously, just draw on each individual contact with a pencil. Works on circuit boards."
vinyl,3cbg9e,msuts,2,Thu Jul 9 17:15:04 2015 UTC,"If you have tried a different set of interconnects, then you know the problem is somewhere inside the turntable. The most likely issues are  a bad cartridge, a bad connection between the cartridge and the tonearm, or a bad connection further down the path between the tonearm and the RCA jacks.  Because your table has a ""Plug in Cartridge Connector System"" you can't really check the wiring from the cartridge easily. I would start with a screwdriver and a multimeter and isolate where the break is. You can also just stick a new cartridge on the end and see if that fixes everything."

I've had a Philips Electronic 312 (with green light bulbs) standing around, not doing anything, with a Budgetline GP400 stylus, for a really long time now. A week ago or something I got the 2LP version of a Dream Theater record, of which I'm sure it's fine.  However, when I'm trying to play it, I get distortion not unlike digital clipping. I doubt it's my preamp, because the issue persists if I plug it into a normal line in. I think it's due to mistracking, because if I increase my tracking force, the distortion decreases, but I have to set it so heavy that the plastic around the stylus (sorry, I'm a noob) touches the record once every rotation, which can't be good.  Do I have to get myself a new stylus, and if I do, which one? I want to avoid Budgetline now, for obvious reasons, and the only other GP400 stylus I can find in this country is a Tonar one, which costs a lot (€150-ish, might as well get a whole new turntable).

vinyl,3cbg9e,Numbaeleven,2,Thu Jul 9 11:19:13 2015 UTC,The two things you need between your turntable and your headphones are a phono stage (aka phono preamp) and a headphone amplifier. You can get as crazy or as simple as you want. The cheapest way is probably to get a vintage receiver that has both built in. (Anything with a headphone jack has a headphone amp in it).

Works great, replaced the cartridge and the belt, and it sounds beautiful. But recently, I was trying to adjust the anti-skate weight and it's completely fallen apart. Here is a picture:  http://i.imgur.com/6UC5hrV.jpg  As far as I can tell, it's a hanging weight style, and extremely cheap based on what I've seen around. It's held on by fishing wire. There is simply no way, with my shaky hands, that I am ever going to retie or adjust this.  What are some ways of fixing this? Is anti-skate important, and will I risk damaging my records without out? Or will there be no serious harm in leaving it off?  My second question is in regards to the tonearm. It will easily continue to spin well past the label on the middle of the record, meaning that I must watch the Turntable when it nears the end lest I ruin both my stylus and record.

However,  we do have a portable Bose speaker that sounds pretty nice. Would it be wiser to spend all of the money on a turntable and then find a way to use that? We could get other speakers later on if the lack of seperation bugs us.   Could I have advice for what to look for with the two price points listed?

vinyl,3cbg9e,MrStudentDude,3,Tue Jul 7 21:34:22 2015 UTC,"Where in Wisconsin? What does the CL look like? If you're looking for new, a good entry level is the AT-LP120, its 209 on Amazon right now. It has a built in preamp so all you would need to connect to your Bose is an RCA stereo male to male 3.5mm. It won't be the best since you won't have too much stereo separation.  As for what to look for in a turntable, all the features on the LP120 are what you need. Adjustable tone arm and pitch control."

vinyl,3cbg9e,MrStudentDude,2,Thu Jul 9 01:36:52 2015 UTC,"First of all, welcome to the fold - this subreddit is more than happy to help anybody looking to upgrade. Don't be ashamed of your Crosley just yet. We were all there at one point!  The AT-LP120 is a good new turntable, and though it seems this subreddit dislikes the bells and whistles it brings (as it supposedly comes at the cost of decreased build/sound quality), I like how much it brings to the table.   However, I think going on Craigslist or eBay and finding a vintage used turntable is your best bet, especially at your price point. I was able to get a great Technics SL-D3 on eBay for $100. Stay on top of eBay listings and you'll be able to find a good turntable. General rule of thumb is that any standard mount Technics that's in good shape is a good turntable.  If you buy a vintage TT, or any new TT that isn't the LP120, you'll need a preamp/amp to use with it. I recommend going the vintage route here again and finding an integrated amplifier like one of these - it'll give you the phono preamp AND amp controls you'll want for your records."

Their hardiness is similar to shellac 78s, although they won't shatter if they're dropped. Anyhow, I've been pondering this for the past week ever since my records came in the mail."
vinyl,3cbg9e,Kirky0331,4,Mon Jul 6 18:09:06 2015 UTC,"Not materials, but thickness.  Thickness has nothing to do with sound quality but a heavier record just FEELS higher quality.  There has been speculation that the heavier records are less prone to warping, but I don't even know if that's true.  180g records are touted as being something special. Your Jefferson airplane record is probably a dynaflex (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynaflex_(RCA)) which came about in the late 60s to save money by using less vinyl. Anyway... The quality of the vinyl is more important than the thickness."
vinyl,3cbg9e,Timewindows,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:20:25 2015 UTC,"While it's probably harder to warp a 180g+ record, in my experience they much more frequently come with dish warp compared to lighter weight records.

vinyl,3cbg9e,blerg34,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:40:29 2015 UTC,"It's probably more likely that the thickness have changed. Lately 180g has become popular, but I've seen releases branded as everything from 120-220g, and there's probably some both lighter and heavier as well.  Also, it's not necessarily a thing that happens over time. It just varies from release to release. For instance, the recent reissue of the Danger Doom album reportedly is very thin and flimsy."

vinyl,3cbg9e,Doolandeer,3,Tue Jul 7 05:03:24 2015 UTC,"I would say probably not. While there is a spec dump at radiomuseum claiming it is 2x40 watt, nearly all the other anecdotal information says either 2x15 or 2x20 watt. The supossed THD spec of .02 is on the Hitatchi is nice and certainly better than the Sherwood, but that would be fresh from the factory in the late 1970's. By now some of the components in the Hitatchi have certainly started to drift, so that value is almost certainly not as good now that it's 30-40 years on. The Sherwood claims an RMS wattage of 100 WPC, but I think that's incredibly optimistic. The THD spec is also 0.9, which is pretty high. But I think both of the those figures are tied, in that the 100 WPC probably running at (or close to) full volume and that introduces a lot of distortion. Having listened to the sister to the RX-4109, the RX-4105 (same receiver sans phono), I would say that it's operating wattage at realistic listening volumes is around 30-50 WPC. At that wattage, it's THD is probably a bit lower as well.  As /u/adayinalife said, the phono section may be better than the Sherwood, but probably not substantially so. Like a good number of vintage units, it also may have a better voicing or color to the sound than the Sherwood. But then again, I've heard plenty of boring, lifeless and sterile vintage receivers as well.  So, as far as wattage goes, you are probably downgrading. As to how it sounds, that would be something you would need to test out. I would say overall, the swap would probably end up as a lateral move instead of an upgrade."

vinyl,3cbg9e,msuts,3,Wed Jul 8 23:07:26 2015 UTC,"It's one of those things where it's best to just google the model number of anything that catches your eye. Many brands have both great and pretty average speakers that may differ by only one number or letter.  Having said that, if you post your local craigslist I can try point you in the right direction with some suggestions."
vinyl,3cbg9e,adayinalife,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:26:59 2015 UTC,"I'm looking for a good bookshelf to hold records on, as well as some other random things like books and cameras. Any suggestions?"
vinyl,3cbg9e,MattMagd,3,Wed Jul 8 23:52:05 2015 UTC,"The IKEA Kallax is one of the most popular choices for record collectors. It fits records perfectly and also works well for books and other stuff. Plus it's pretty affordable.  Alternatively you can look into the IKEA Nornäs. It's imo better looking than the Kallax, a little sturdier, but is also more expensive.  Both come in various sizes."
vinyl,3cbg9e,rpbtz,3,Thu Jul 9 00:05:03 2015 UTC,"+1 for Nornas  IMO it is well worth the price increase over the Kallax, both aesthetically and in terms of practicality (much sturdier as mentioned). The Nornas  bench is great for someone looking to hold both their turntable and amp as well records."
vinyl,3cbg9e,adayinalife,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:40:42 2015 UTC,Is this turntable a good deal? I got a LP-120 for free and now looking to maybe moving to vintage and this is the best for the price I was able to find on my local Craigslist. I just don't want to make a stupid purchase. Is $175 too much? Are there other tables on my Craigslist that I'm missing out on? I'm really not looking to spend more than $400 on a TT + a receiver. Thanks!
vinyl,3cbg9e,X-cessiveBandit,2,Thu Jul 9 01:36:24 2015 UTC,"It's not a bad TT but I'm not so sure it's really an upgrade from your free LP-120. In a vacuum it's a good purchase for $100, but if you already have a LP120 in fine working condition then you shouldn't buy this."
vinyl,3cbg9e,msuts,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:01:26 2015 UTC,"What's the consensus on the Gemini TT-1100? I've been looking at a decent, new cheap turntable with a built in preamp and had my heart set on the Audio Technica LP120, but this looks like relatively the same thing for about $100 cheaper. Is it too light, are the components cheap feeling, any problems with tonearm, et cetera?"
vinyl,3cbg9e,Psychobilly2175,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:10:38 2015 UTC,"I'd opt for the LP120, it's a proven entry level workhorse, the reviews for the Gemini are less than stellar."
vinyl,3cbg9e,adayinalife,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:14:02 2015 UTC,"Really? I mean, I know both are Technics clones, but I've never tried either. I know the price would probably signify the difference in quality, but as long as it allows me to adjust it so it doesn't stab holes and skate around my vinyl, I can't really be disappointed. Have you tried either?"
vinyl,3cbg9e,Psychobilly2175,2,Thu Jul 9 04:17:58 2015 UTC,"I've tried a different SL1200 clone, identical looking to the LP120 though (but they are all made by the same company, Hanpin, so it's likely to be very similar) and it was great. I have seen the Gemini at a shop, very light ""plasticy"" belt-driven player (not DD).  If you're looking to save a it of money, which is fair enough, I would look into buying vintage instead of the Gemini."
vinyl,3cbg9e,adayinalife,2,Thu Jul 9 04:22:04 2015 UTC,"Nah, I'll just go with the LP120 like I was going to. Not worth saving a buck if it's going to another piece of crap player haha I didn't buy nice speakers for that. Thank you so much."

vinyl,3cbg9e,jaureguis,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:31:46 2015 UTC,It's about the going rate these days. Have seen a few for $100 but they seem to be beat up or missing a dust cover. Does it come with a cart/stylus?
vinyl,3cbg9e,adayinalife,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:40:37 2015 UTC,"yes it does, but I'm assuming it's always a good idea to replace them once you buy it. it's an audio technica one, not sure of the model, the plastic is yellow if that's any help though I'm doubtful."
vinyl,3cbg9e,jaureguis,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:51:19 2015 UTC,It was more to see whether you would need to buy just a stylus or the whole cart/stylus combo :) I say for $150 it's a very solid table.

vinyl,3cce2f,princessamandoop,5,Mon Jul 6 20:35:09 2015 UTC,"The Dresden Dolls are a self-branded ""punk cabaret"" duo from Boston, MA. They formed in 2000, consisting of vocalist/pianist/song writer Amanda Palmer and percussionist/occasionally guitarist/bassist Brian Viglione. All of their songs, more or less, have dark undertones or straight up, slap-in-the-face macabre humor (such as a fictional back alley abortionist the horribly clever lyrics of ""Mandy Goes to Med School"").  The band stayed together until 2008 when they took a 2 year hiatus, went on a ""reunion tour"" and haven't really been together since. That was, until April 2015, when The Dresden Dolls unveiled ""The Virginia Monologues"": a 3-LP, Record Store Day Exclusive.  This release is a combination of The Dresden Dolls so called ""breakthrough album"", ""Yes Virginia"" and the b-sides from that album ""No Virginia"", which both had never been released on vinyl before. And I know many people are extremely averted to Record Store Day, which I totally understand. But when one of my favorite bands, that has long disbanded, releases anything, you know I'm going to jump on it. And how could i resist? This thing is a masterpiece! Each of the records are on colored vinyl (black/white marbled, blue/white marbled, and red/black marbled), the first two being the entirety of ""Yes Virginia"", and the third, ""No Virginia"". The three LPs are housed in a tri-pocket, book-like gate-fold jacket. Each ""page"" is packed to the brim with letters, snippets of newspapers, pictures and artwork. On top of it being an absolutely aesthetically gorgeous record, the music is equally as fantastic. (If you're new to The Dresden Dolls, I'd suggest from this album ""Backstabber"", ""My Alcoholic Friends"", and ""Mrs. O""). It's unique, sometimes upbeat (even though the lyrics are far from upbeat), and just overall a great listen!  If you haven't heard of The Dresden Dolls before, I'd suggest you check them out if you don't mind slightly controversial lyrics and puns! Thanks for reading and have a great day! (p.s. this is my first post on here, constructive criticism would be greatly appreciated!)"

vinyl,3caqfs,Panzerfaust79,7,Mon Jul 6 13:02:19 2015 UTC,"A few weeks ago I bumped into a nice deal on this Transrotor TR800 tonearm on Ebay. It's in fact a Jelco SA 250. The guy lives very close by and happens to be a real handy tweaker. So he even fitted it for me on a modified SME armplate. Very happy with it, not a big improvement because the stoch arm is quite good, but a bit lifeless in my opinion. Sound opened up some more with the new arm, and I think it just looks badass ;)"

vinyl,3caqfs,TheSchneid,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:25:49 2015 UTC,Kinda new to vinyl (<1 year) so I have a question. Why would you need to buy a new tone arm and what are the advantages of replacing one.  Don't get me wrong I'm not saying your purchase was unjustified or careless as I have no idea what the circumstances were. I just don't understand when or why you would need to get a new one other than it just being SUPER old. Thanks and sorry for my lack of intelligence on the matter.
vinyl,3caqfs,modman2,2,Mon Jul 6 18:05:56 2015 UTC,"He even said it didn't make a huge difference. Most of the time when people do tonearm swaps it's a new $2000 tonearm on a $10,000+ table. Some people claim you can turn a technics 1200 into a table of a similar caliber with some upgrades, seems like op has fallen down that rabbit hole. I have an old technics and a project and I'll keep em stock, but different strokes for different folks. I put most of my money into speakers and cartridge myself."
vinyl,3caqfs,batnastard,7,Mon Jul 6 19:50:04 2015 UTC,"Imo, A stock Technics is already the highest caliber of turntable. Ofc Carts and audio equipment will make more of a difference, but getting a Musichall or Pro-ject table is just simply pointless compared to a SL-1200."
vinyl,3caqfs,blocz,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:18:59 2015 UTC,"The sl-1200 arm has truly excellent bearings, but lousy wiring. OP is likely hearing the improvement in wiring but may have lost something via the bearings. When I got my sl-1200 I did a lot of research, and it seems like any arm in the $300-$500 range (say, a Rega or even a Jelco) is mostly a lateral move. People do report incredible results with arms in the $1000-$2000 range like a SME V or something, but a lot of those folks upgrade lots of other parts as well."

Honestly, I was blow away by packaging alone, made it really feel like an expensive gift to my doorstep.   Secondly, I got myself Menomena and Hot Chip, but I've listened to a few curated albums they've put out digitally. Some albums are really standouts, others are growers and not your first-time love; it's still taking a little time but I'm slowly appreciating Donuts for what it is.  Thirdly, you get a member store where free shipping in the US meets discounted deals on albums/singles. I burned $100 on the store for the two months of curation. It's worth it to point it out.

I've gotten two records I never normally would have bought, but thats okay with me.  I am currently almost 30, and I used to be heavy into independent and local artists.  As I'm now a semi-fully functional member of society with 2 kids I have less time to spend going to concerts and such.  I love that I am forced to give music a try.  25$ is a little steep, but I've tacked on records for the free shipping (Getting Desaparcidos ""Payola"" this month.)  I'm not really interested in the Art Prints as much, but my wife has said she'd be interested in framing some.  So thats cool with me.  I wish they would throw other extras in as well.  I'd be willing to pay a bit more for a unique bonus 7"" or something.  I also do the Joyful Noise Deluxe VIP and end up ordering almost every VIP Exclusive as well on there.  I would keep doing the Joyful Noise before VMP simply because I love knowing exactly who/what I'm supporting, but I'll probably keep doing both.

vinyl,3cagow,cok666n,4,Mon Jul 6 13:21:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's the problem with acoustics and room placement. If you want it ideal, you almost have to have a dedicated listening room (which is ridiculous for most of us... or it is for me anyway).  There's a couple guides for placing speakers in ideal positions if you google 'audio room placement'. If I look at my speaker's manual (Monitor BX5s) for exemple, they say :   For use in a 2 channel system, the listening position and the loudspeakers should form an equilateral triangle. The speakers should be positioned approximately 6 - 10 feet (1.8 - 3m) apart. They ideally need to be between 8 - 18 inches (20 - 45cm) away from the rear and 3 feet (1m) from the side walls.   I don't respect that most of the time, since the towers would be in the way. But, when I get a new record, I place the speakers in the optimal position before I listen to it for the first time. I do hear a difference between this placement and my everyday position (about a feet away from the walls)."
vinyl,3cagow,cok666n,2,Mon Jul 6 13:58:58 2015 UTC,"Okay, so... yeah... I didn't think it'd make a huge difference to the sound.... but... wowzer.    Although the first thing my wife said was: ""you're not leaving those speakers out there are you?"" - not a question, an order. :P"

vinyl,3cavtl,NumbersSystem,9,Mon Jul 6 13:55:40 2015 UTC,"Hey folks,  I am mostly into DJ'ing and collecting most kinds of electronic music one could find himself or herself dancing to - EDM if you'd like - and though most of the time I'll be posting or ""digging"" in my favourite subs, /r/truehouse or /r/theoverload, I also greatly enjoy lurking on this sub here to get my fix of cool-looking turntables and what not. What I enjoy most about this sub though are the posts of passionate people showing off their latest haul from the record store and the story behind them. More than once do I find myself discovering some kind of artist, band or type of music I like, after someone managed to convince me to look it up by showing off a nicely designed cover.  Now I know electronic music is not as prevalent on here, maybe because a 4 track EP with a generic cardboard sleeve doesn't really give an as immersive experience as for example an entire Tycho LP? Maybe because the enjoyment of electronic dance music is intrinsically bound to a context other than your living room? Maybe because people on here just don't like House music? Who knows?  But still (or perhaps because of this) I wish to share with you my latest haul of records! Obviously because I just want you to share in my excitement, but secondly: I also hope to perhaps inspire some of you to dig further and discover a side of music which you have never ventured to before. Very much in the same way this sub so far has managed to educate me in the world of Jazz, Funk, Soul and even Doom Metal, I hope to educate you on the world of House, Acid or Techno!  So, without further ado, a little album of my latest batch of records - it's also in the title obviously - and a little write-up about them and my favorite record and it's corresponding producer: Vakula!  in order of appearance:  Vakula - Picture of You EP [dkmntl006] (2013)  For starters, this is the record I'd like to talk to you about the most. Not only have I been after this record for quite some time now, I also believe Vakula to be my favorite producer of the last few years and I think you'll find him interesting. Let me tell you something about him.  Vakula is a producer and DJ hailing from Konotop, Ukraine who puts forth a very distinct and refreshing, dreamy kind of House music, a kind of music that I believe is the very definition of genre-breaking. He is known for his virtuose combination of Ukrainian/Russian folk(lore) with Jazz, Soul, Ambient and the more well-known themes of Detroit House and Electro. His tracks are often cultural patchworks, with African conga's and rhythms, melancholic pads and synths from detroit and a plethora of Russian and Ukrainian instruments like the bandura.   Besides this he is also known for his conceptual and philosophical approach towards his productions. All his albums are very strongly centered around a central connecting theme, they tell a story both musically as well as thematically. He manages to achieve this and stick to a central theme, without the whole release ever sounding monotonous or bland. His first album for example tries to convince the listener that they in fact ""Have never been to Konotop""  - Vakula's hometown. The album is laced with field recordings and Ukrainian soundscapes and instruments, and therefore is aptly called: ""You've never been to Konotop (Selected Ambient Works 2009-2012)"". He blends all these elements together into an original and cohesive triple LP release which captivates both the ears and the feet. Let me illustrate shortly with the folowing 2:  This track: Vakula - Sleepy Vision for example is straight up Jazz-fusion goodness, very easy on the ears.  While this track: Vakula - Mama Said Go Slow off of the same album is obviously on the Detroit House side of the spectrum with it's dreamy synths and pads and is very danceable!    To further emphasize his conceptual modus operandi, the latest album put forth by vakula ""A voyage to Arcturus"" is Vakula's musical reiteration of the David Lindsay novel by the same name, effectively soundtracking his perception of one of his favorite books. Recommended to anyone fan of the novel obviously.  Check out the entire album, it's a great listen - especially Joiwind!  Vakula also made a fantastic s/t album under his Vedomir monikker. A great Leftfieldish Techno album with the signature funk from Vakula paired up with just a bit more kicks, snares and 303's. And to top it all off, his upcoming album is going to be a Jim Morrison tribute, I believe this further illustrates the broadness of his scope on music and his interesting approach to music production.  on with the record already!! - haha, sorry   As you can hopefully tell, I am a big fan of Vakula, I think ALL his productions are great, not just the albums, also his numerous EPs on labels such as the Amsterdam based Dekmantel or on his own Leleka and Bandura imprints which further flesh out his more electronic and dance-oriented side.   To make a long story short, this is my favorite EP from Vakula. It has been on discogs for ages for around 50 bucks, but I never actually bought it thinking I would just do that when the time was right. Then, all of a sudden, it came back in stock at Dekmantel after they found some back whilst cleaning their attic. I got it immediately for the regular price of 9 euros, happy days.  The track that truly captivates me is the title track, Picture of You. It is such a strong track emotionaly, it is very endearing yet very strong as well. It is trance inducing and whether i'm happy or sad, it always manages to speak to my very core.   I guess I should let the music do more of the talking:   Vakula - Picture of You  Well, I hope you liked reading all of this and are perhaps inspired a bit to dig a little deeper into this side of the musical spectrum. If you have any questions feel free to ask ofcourse!..  oke oke on with the rest, already aaah yeah, the rest of the records I bought..  I'll sum up the other 5 records in my Imgur-album and tell a little bit about them and provide my favorite track off of the release for you!   Modini - Tart EP [DABJ1215] (2015)  Great EP by Modini (Neil Landstrum + Hostage). Hard-hitting house with a thick bassline and laced with disco and electro motifs, great for destroying dancefloors. Something competely different than Vakula, but that only adds to the pleasures of being a DJ!  Favorite track: Modini - Budgie  Esa - Gwalaka Fortune EP [OM003] (2014)  Omena is a more alternative off-shoot of Swedish Deep House-label Local Talk, curated by Local Talk main-man Tooli himself. This Record just totally fits up my alley of spaced out house with a dab of acid on Umatic 3000.  Favourite track: Esa - Umatic 3000  Naphta - Baltic Rim EP [OM004] (2015)  After getting on to Omena through 003 I also gave 004 a spin and was immediately sold by the versatility of this record, two awesome tracks by Naptha  and two amaaazing remixes. All four tracks together all encompass a totally different vibe.  Favourite track: Naphta - Striker Eureka (Tooli's Disjointed in Mallorca Remix)  House of Doors - Starcave/BurmSTAR [MH009] (2015)  To be honest, I always end up regretting not picking up a Mood Hut record - a Vancouver, BC based label with some of the hottest selectors and producers of the moment. So I just went with it this time. 2 Mellowed out house tracks with one of them coming in two flavors. Great for afternoon zen-gardening or deathmetalyoga-parties.  Favourite track: House of Doors - Starcave  Palms Trax - In Gold EP [dkmntl024] (2015)  Palms Trax is another one of my favourite artists, he has convinced me for life with his first release on Lobster Theremin and I remember boldly saying to myself ""I am going to buy every record this man is gonna make"".. and well, so far so good, on to the next one!  Favourite track: Palms Trax - Sumo Acid Crew  Anyhow, I guess this is long enough! I hope you enjoyed the little show-and-tell post and gave some of the records a spin. Perhaps some more 'heads come out of the woodwork and share some of their special records with us too and we can get a bit more variety in music going in this sub.  Cheerio!  edit 1: I'll correct my spelling and formatting some more, later."
vinyl,3cavtl,dillont3,4,Mon Jul 6 13:55:46 2015 UTC,"It is nice to see another Vakula fan on here! I don't usually listen to much house/EDM but I really enjoy Vakula! I tend to listen to more Techno, dub techno, experimental techno, ambient music, etc. in general. I don't have any of Vakula's EPs yet (not many record stores in US that have any Vakula in stock and very few US discogs seller that have any Vakula for reasonable prices.) I bought You Have never been to Konotop for about $70 a little while ago once I finally found a US seller who had a copy of it on vinyl in VG+ condition. It took a little while after it was released, but I was happy to finally find one US record store online that had Voyage to Arcturus on vinyl and was able to snag a copy of that album for retail price. I really enjoy both albums, but I think Konotop is still my favorite. I need to track down some Vakula or Vedomir EP's next. Nice find!  I will have to check out some of those other artists as well. You should check out Stephan Bodzin's - Powers of Ten album. It is definitely my favorite techno album so far this year and there is a little bit of house influence in it as well. Killer album!"
vinyl,3cavtl,submarinefacemelt,2,Mon Jul 6 14:26:11 2015 UTC,"You should definetely check out the Vedomir LP then, if you like Experimental Techno and Ambient. I mean, it's neither very Techno nor very Ambient.. It's just very Vakula, haha.. It's stuff you have not heard that often before, it surprises the listener without being cheap or cliché or whatever haha.  This track for example very Ambienty and very trance-inducing to listen to, but also a great DJ-tool!  or my favorite track, which also doubles as my ""words to live by"", very cool almost orchestral slow-jam that surprises at every turn.  Oh and yes, I dig Bodzin, but I'll make sure to put on some this evening and listen to the album again!   Thanks for reading! :)"

vinyl,3cejbj,dethrock,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:17:53 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm an asshole or selfish, but when my daughter was born I never planned to make my audio gear ""kid safe"". Instead of taking precautions to keep her from my stuff I just taught her not to touch it at all. It seemed to have worked because she is 3.5 now and I can play records (on a turntable that is sitting at half her height, mind you) and she doesn't even think about going near it or touching it or any of my gear for that matter. It truly amazes me how much parents these days sacrifice on behalf of their kids instead of just getting their children accustomed to the way things were before they were born. I know you can't apply this logic to every thing, but I think it's very extreme when people completely abandon their hobbies or the things they like to do all because they have a kid. /rant."

The user has a setup for dedicated listening. This is his setup for listening with his family; music was something that he wanted to actively share with his kids. The distinction here is that it's the music that's important not the setup. He obviously did not abandoned his hobby, but has instead shared it with his children. They're enjoying it how they want to.    With the move to the real world, it’s become collective – a shared activity the girls look forward to and ask for.  It sure beats lumping around in front of a TV for a family activity.  We talk about music, theory, instruments, history, and meaning.  We also spend some time talking about components and what they do – how it makes music.  Even as a toddler who can barely walk, each of them was mesmerized by putting on a record and hearing music come out.  The eldest looks through catalogs with me, and we have plans for putting together her own system – building the speakers from a kit (pretty purple with butterflies on them) and so on."

vinyl,3cbygo,the_yetimonster,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:49:23 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately due to the numerous downsides you've mentioned, which have been experienced by many grado owners, as well as myself in my experiences hearing them and handling them, I have not been a fan of even their higher end offerings and thus can not/do not reccomend using them. The way I see them, they're a market offering for those who are looking for a ""sweeter"" sound more so than pure and complete accuracy. A sort of romantic ""vintage"", ""warm"" sound, yadda yadda yadda, call it what you will. In that case there are lots of options on the market, many of which are just as poorly shielded and equally bad at tracking! I jest (slightly) but they can sound very pleasant, even if very far from the aural truth that lies in the grooves. It's a different philosophy to build a playback system around, just not one for me :)"

vinyl,3cbygo,MrRom92,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:28:41 2015 UTC,I'm actually surprised you haven't seen it on the SAS stylus - they exhibit very similar behavior at the start of their break-in period. Maybe a resonance thing involving the suspension. No idea to be honest.
vinyl,3cbygo,closetslacker,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:30:54 2015 UTC,I had U-turn with Grado Green and it was a horrible combination that sounded like I had pillows over my speakers. I tried U-turn with AT95 and it still sounded muddy. At that point I decided to stop experimenting and sold the U-turn. For what it's worth...
vinyl,3cbygo,intravenus_de_milo,0,Mon Jul 6 19:49:00 2015 UTC,"I think the Grado Black and SL1200 sound very cd like.  Which is neither praise nor criticism.  Personally tho, if I want  cd like timbre, (which is really none at all)  I'll just listen to cds.    With vinyl I prefer something with a bit more color.  Swapping carts is just like swapping pick ups in a guitar, they have their own sound, and it's just a matter of finding one you like.  I've also got a Shure V15 III, which is very bright and punchy -- a classic rock cart. If you spent your whole life listening to Led Zeppelin on that, I can understand why cds sound flat.  It's too much for me however, as I like more Jazz and AAA than rock music.   So I settled on a Denon DL-103, which is a nice compromise between something like the Grado Black and the Shure and it mates well with a heavier arm on the 1200."

vinyl,3cca1e,damnspynovels,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:10:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, correct - in your case.  There are some circumstances when this is different - for example:  The Ortofon OM cartridge can handle most, if not all OM styli - which means you have the full upgrade path available to you.  The Ortofon 2M Red & Blue share exactly the same cartridge, as do the Bronze & Black. It's slightly more complicated in the sense that whilst all four colours fit either carts, the insides of each cart is different - so whilst sticking a Black stylus on the cart designed for the Red or Blue will fit, you won't be benefiting from everything the Black stylus has to offer.   Hope that makes sense."

As in, they want you to take the ""whole lot off their hands"" abundant and ""there may only be one good record in the bunch"" abundant.   For choice sides I've resorted to eBay. Finding even a moderately interesting 78 in the wild is a rare success for me.   Think about it in terms of LPs - how many times do you go to the thrifts and find cool blue note and prestige jazz LPs? Right, now how many times do you go there and find things like Barbara Streisand, Ray Conniff, etc.? Because that's what was popular by numbers alone, people tend to have shitty taste in music, and as it turns out, people happen to really enjoy ""earl plays the xylophone"" for whatever reason."

vinyl,3c99yg,isthishandletaken,5,Mon Jul 6 17:35:51 2015 UTC,Have you tried cleaning the record?  It's a good idea to clean new records to remove debris from the factory. A microfiber cloth and distilled water should be good enough to clean it.  It would also be good to use a carbon fiber brush.

Fuck that. So whatever color was in there before, good chance it's remnants are getting into the first few records on the next job on the line. Won't effect anything. I think it looks cool actually. You'll rarely see a purely white record since it's so easy to notice slight discolorations.   In any case, if the record was actually dirty, woodglue would adequately clean it. The only thing it doesn't excel at lifting out are things like oils or residues like things from smoke, etc. very intensive cleaning is required for things like that, although woodglue would make a particularly good step in that process."

Very cool.  Synthesator vol. six by Brad E. Rose: Local album featuring noise/ambient made on analog synths  Fucked Up - Year of the Hare: an installment in the zodiac series. This one has a lot of psychedelic elements which is interesting with the hardcore singing  Lotus Fucker - self titled: Hardcore punk band from D.C. its very noisy and very fast. I dig it quite a bit.  Thee Oh Sees - Singles Collection Vol. 3: features live songs, songs from splits, and singles. Very good. Theres a great Sonic Youth cover on it. The art also looks much better in person.  Iron Chic - The Constant One: Pop-Punk with a twist. Not normally my taste but I can get into this one.   Age of Electronicus: Interesting synth album from the sixties. Around when the Moog first came out.   Edit: The store was Holy Mountain in Tulsa, Ok."

An incorrect (or slightly off, rather) VTA shouldn't cause channel imbalance.  Keep in mind that a slight channel imbalance is normal.  Almost none of my carts are in perfect balance; most of them are hot in the left channel for whatever reason.  This is why there's a balance control on your amp."
vinyl,3cbhx8,LaserRanger,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:02:01 2015 UTC,"That's a great idea, thanks. I'll try it out but the mounting screws that came with the M97 are pretty short hopefully it will work."
vinyl,3cbhx8,LaserRanger,2,Mon Jul 6 17:10:01 2015 UTC,"This kit has sold for less previously, but it does have a flat spacer, two round spacers, plus longer screws and a nice stylus brush.  You might also find the screws you need at a hardware store.  I believe the ones you want are 3-48, but you'll need to bring your headshell and cart to make sure everything fits.  2-56 may also work, and you may want to check for washers too.  I used a metric washer (to fit inside the grooves on the top of the headshell) with a 3-48 screw and it worked."
vinyl,3cbhx8,GothamCountySheriff,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:30:38 2015 UTC,"I was wondering what size screws it used. Thanks for the info. I'll see if my local Home Depot and/or Lowes has anything of that size. If not, I'll probably order that kit. The screws on the original cart are very slightly thicker but significantly longer. I believe they are 16.5mm long and the ones the shure cart came with are about 8-9mm."

vinyl,3cbhx8,MrRom92,2,Mon Jul 6 19:39:44 2015 UTC,"There are shims you can install in the headshell to accommodate for differences in VTA requirements although to be honest I don't believe that this would account for such a noticeable channel imbalance- that is definitely more of a cartridge azimuth issue. Is it possible that somehow the cartridge is not ""level"" in the headshell? How about the diamond, if you look closely as to how it's actually mounted - does it look good? I love the m97xe cart itself and recommend it heavily, but lately it has not been unheard of for bad styli to pass QC before they get to buyers."
vinyl,3cbhx8,zebowski,2,Mon Jul 6 17:08:20 2015 UTC,"I'm really enjoying the M97xe it is pulls the music out of the groves as it was recorded without much bias in any frequency (or at least of what my speakers are capable of). As far as I can tell the cartridge is level in the headshell but between the guard on the cartridge and the actual headhsell being as wide as it is, it is hard enough just to align the cartridge with the protractor that came with it. I'll have to maybe pick up a lighted magnifying glass so i can really see whats going on with that diamond."

vinyl,3caoed,MrRom92,2,Mon Jul 6 13:11:44 2015 UTC,"These days I believe ""programme"" usually refers to twice the average power. I would not take much note of it. Basically look at the sensitivity, the lower the number the more power you need to drive it to similar volumes."

Also the Expedit is not being made anymore and its replacement, the Kallax, should be a little more sturdy and is probably the most popular storage option atm."

It was replacing the most popular record storage option after all.  That said I think the ones you mention are better looking than the Kallax.  Alternatively the IKEA Nornäs is also a good (and imo much prettier) alternative, although more expensive than the Kallax. It has an actual back side attached (unlike the Kallax), so it offers better support."

vinyl,3c7gxw,BriMarsh,3,Mon Jul 6 04:21:54 2015 UTC,"A carboot sale is where loads of people sell stuff in a field, traditionally out of their car boot, hence the name.  It differs from a garage sale because the sellers all congregate in one place rather than sell from their own homes."

vinyl,3c7gxw,random19489284239042,2,Mon Jul 6 17:52:34 2015 UTC,"It looks like that Revolver is mono, you might have the rare copy with remix 11 of Tomorrow Never Knows. Look at the deadwax on side 2, does it say XEX 606-1? If so, that album in decent condition is worth quite a bit of money (and it's worth hearing the alternate mix of Tomorrow Never Knows as well).  Info from The Beatles Collection blog:   1.First pressing, August 5, 1966. “Remix 11″ mispressing. Side 2 matrix no.: XEX 606-1 have “Remix 11″ of “Tomorrow Never Knows”. When “Revolver” was initially mixed a different master for “Tomorrow Never Knows” was sent off to be pressed. This mix is known as ‘Remix 11′. Although subtle, it is different to the standard ‘Remix 8′ which was ultimately to replace it. The story goes that each group member was given the first copies from the production line and John went to listen to it. But, it turned out that he was unhappy with the mix or that the wrong one had been used and he informed George Martin. Production was then stopped as the new masters were cut and the pressing plates were replaced. First presses have a side 2 matrix number of XEX 606-1 whereas the standard presses have XEX 606-2 and beyond.  Black label with yellow logo and silver print. “The Gramophone Co. Ltd.” printed at the start perimeter print and “Sold in U.K. subject…” text.  Plain white or sepia “LP advertising” inner sleeves. With or without KT tax code on the label. Matrix numbers: Side 1: XEX 605-1 or -2; Side 2: XEX 606-1.  This is how the labels first appeared on the shelves. Still using the sans serif Arial typeset. Also, these early labels misprint the side 2 track Doctor Robert as “Dr. Robert”. These early Sans-serif labels have each song title starting on a new line with the first line purely for “Taxman” and have “Eleanor Rigby” starting on the second line down. Also something to note on these original labels is that each song title was followed by song credits and then lead vocalist."
vinyl,3c7gxw,random19489284239042,0,Sun Jul 5 17:35:58 2015 UTC,yeah the matrix number is xex 606-1 :) not bad for £2.50

vinyl,3c83s2,TRKLTBLCKMTL,3,Sun Jul 5 20:02:10 2015 UTC,"So once again, two recent pickups. One new release and one from the used bin.  Best Coast - California Nights  Third album by this two-piece band, and in my opinion a step up from their previous album ""The Only Place"". After they released their first LP which was a fuzzy and dreamy indierock record, they experimented with more stripped-down songs on The Only Place. Even though I liked it, it just lacked that certain something their first album had. On California Nights that void seems to be filled again, which results in a pretty great guitarpop-album, perfect for warm summer nights.  Blonde Redhead - 23  Loads of people have recommended this band to me in the past and every time they talked about Blonde Redhead it seemed like something I would definitely enjoy. I just never got around to listening to them. So this weekend I walked into my favorite recordstore and this was sitting in their used records bin for $10. I just figured I'd pick it up and see what it's all about.  I've listened to it only once, but so far I'm liking it. Nothing mindblowing, but definitely an enjoyable album for fans of jangly dreampoppy/noisy rock."

You should check out Flying Lotus too, amazing instrumental hip-hop/electronica and one of the best producers around  J Dilla is also worth a mention, he was one of the best beat makers ever. His album Dilla Donuts is fantastic.  A lot of the classics these people mentioned are excellent too. Nas - Illmatic is also one of the best albums of the 1990s.

vinyl,3c666u,Khemikooligan,3,Sun Jul 5 18:47:43 2015 UTC,What about GKMC is appealing to you?
vinyl,3c666u,ninfan200,2,Sun Jul 5 19:10:00 2015 UTC,"I like the production a lot better for one (sorry FlyLo), the choice of samples, i like Kendrick's lyrics a lot better, i like the whole cohesive story that goes on throughout the album with the creepy lo-fi interludes, i like the instrumentation, i love Kendrick's delivery and vocals, everything about it was excellent.   For the record, i'm not saying the new one is bad, Kendrick has proved to be a an artist that can deliver consistently good material, but i don't know, it's far too soon for me to even form an opinion about it. I only listened to it once so far, i'm going to wait until the hype dies down a bit to revisit it again"
vinyl,3c666u,Boner4Stoners,3,Sun Jul 5 21:27:39 2015 UTC,"You posted a little deeper into this thread that you were going to ""wait for the hype to die down"" to revisit it - I'm really not sure why the hype would be deterring your enjoyment of the music - but either way, TPAB is superior to GKMC in every conceivable way. The diversity of the production / vocal delivery and the creative / forward-thinking rhythmic and lyrical structures are much more complex and rewarding over time than anything on GKMC. He found a way to pull off the ""concept album with every song tied together"" without rehashing what he did on GKMC, and he did it with even more success - the final poem in its entirety is breathtaking. GKMC was an album that took a lot of widespread mainstays of popular hip-hop music and used them to expose their audience to something with more substance. TPAB is Kendrick delivering on that promise - no longer is he relying on sprucing up the songs with trap-influenced beats or party rap anthems to appeal to a larger audience. It's weirder, darker, more colorful, more creative, more experimental, more varied, more focused, and just overall a better album in every conceivable way.  I honestly cannot fathom how people can seriously believe GKMC is better in any respect."

vinyl,3c666u,astrovinyl,2,Mon Jul 6 06:56:57 2015 UTC,"I find the instrumentation boring. I think the lyrics are lazy. I think the whole idea for In an Aeroplane over the sea is stupid. To me it feels like Neutral Milk Hotel fans point to in an aeroplane over the sea and think the lyrics are incredible but to me it just came off as a man in his twenties reacting to anne frank and people going bananas over a book that literally every 7th grade kid has read. It's probably one of the weakest parallels to literature made in music, yet people look at it like gold.  People reguard this band as an amazing band but the reality of the situation is they made two albums and neither of them I really connected with and I just found both lack luster. I don't get why this band is so beloved, like i've said, i've tried to see it but I can't. I think what happened is pitchfork just has a hard on for them and they can do no wrong in peoples eyes. Jeff magnum or whatever his name is mascarades poop as art. I know you can walk a fine line with art sometimes but I think this band for me always ends up in the poop category. But that's just my opinion of it.   I'm into bands some of which are universally hated by popular culture and even many sub cultures. One of these bands would be Phish. I never recommend them to anyone and am not the type of phish or music fan that demands people like them, I know it's not for everybody and a lot of people think they're a stupid band. However if i'm asked to point to concrete reasons why I like them, I can do it. With Neutral Milk Hotel, if you ask a fan why they like them you never get a straight answer. They just say, ""eh you know, the lyrics are amazing"" granted that is a reason, but plenty of bands have amazing lyrics but aren't held in such high esteem as this band. People who like this band act like you are just a moron if you don't get it, but seldom offer reasons of what there is to actually get."
vinyl,3c666u,Guardfan801,2,Mon Jul 6 17:08:47 2015 UTC,"I can give you a straight answer. The compositions of Neutral Milk Hotel songs are incredible. Mangum's sense of melody is absolutely stunning - the vocal melodies of the title track and ""Holland 1945"" burrow deep into your psyche and can never be unheard. They are not a ""flashy"" band who try to coax you into enjoying their music with lots of stand-out hooks or gimmicks, but rather a band that relies heavily on melody, composition, lyrics and emotional content. I actually didn't understand the hype for my first few listens of the record, and somewhere along my fifth (or so) listen I realized it was total brilliance. The melodies cry and ache with emotional devastation and longing, but it's removed enough to not come across as whiny or schmaltzy. It's like a sad acceptance of everything so destructive, violent and corrupt in the world. That combined with their excellent dynamics and pacing - they gently guide the listener through noise-oriented rock tunes, slow and somber ballads, and acoustic numbers. It is truly an excellent album and I really suggest you give it a few more listens. It can take quite some time to sink in.  And by the way, Phish is fucking terrible."
vinyl,3c666u,Guardfan801,2,Mon Jul 6 18:09:05 2015 UTC,"I do respect your analysis of it, maybe i'm missing it. Who knows. I'm just saying i've tried to enjoy it and I really can't.   Like I said, Phish isn't for everyone, a lot of people hate them and i'm quite alright knowing not everyone likes them. I don't know if you know but phish actually did cover In the Airplane over the Sea live a few years ago. So maybe Phish likes them. haha."
vinyl,3c666u,Dagingerbaker,2,Mon Jul 6 19:00:09 2015 UTC,"I find the instrumentation boring.   Jeff's chord progressions are very simple but the horn sections are really well done.   I think what happened is pitchfork just has a hard on for them   That's kinda silly to say, p4k reviewed the album in 2005, 7 years after release. Sure, they gave it a 10 but there are a lot of 10s they've given out. And I don't know if you're implying this, but implying that people only like it because p4k does is REALLY silly.   With Neutral Milk Hotel, if you ask a fan why they like them you never get a straight answer.   I can't speak for all of us but I can definitely give an answer. I love them because their lyrics really are fantastic. I also love Jeff's voice and the emotion he displays through it. A good example is towards the end of Oh Comely when his voice blends with the horns. The lyrics aren't for everyone because they're often surreal and cryptic but they are very good."
vinyl,3c666u,Dagingerbaker,2,Mon Jul 6 21:01:19 2015 UTC,What a fascinating and well-articulated opinion. It would be excellent if you could weight your views with some sort of actual content so they could spark a discussion of the music rather than be a finger-waggling scroogian asshole.

vinyl,3c7whw,MrRom92,2,Sun Jul 5 21:19:03 2015 UTC,"I just bought this exact TT as a gift for a friend's birthday, for $10 on Craigslist. Only reason it was $10 was because the arm wasn't balanced at all, and the seller didn't know how to fix it—so we negotiated a price. Then I had it fixed by a pro, and it sings like a canary.  Once I found a decent receiver w/ amp and a pair of bookshelf speakers, I set it up at said friend's house, and she said it's been sounding great. Though, I think her husband is using it more."

vinyl,3c9lbr,iLovePanda265,3,Mon Jul 6 04:10:26 2015 UTC,SL1300 is probably the best value of the lot. The SL1500 is great but not worth that pricetag.
vinyl,3c9lbr,adayinalife,2,Mon Jul 6 06:58:11 2015 UTC,"Either the Technics SL-1300 or would by my choice. The Technics has a better cartridge on it (Stanton 681). The cart on the Marantz is good as well (Pickering V15, AKA the Stanton 500), but the Stanton 681 is a better cartridge than the 500."

I have been going to this swap meet the past 4 years or so and it's great every year. Lots of hobbyists and collectors come to buy/sell/trade.

The pre-amp and amp were off ebay and though they work I wish I'd put the effort in and searched for a 2nd hand amp.  all up it set me back about $120usd.

Generic/aftermarket styli vary in quality. It's best to research it and read what other people have to say about it.  Not all carts have generic/aftermarket styli available. I think it has to do with the patents the original company puts on the design. Grado comes to mind.  Sites that sell generic/aftermarket styli include: eBay, Amazon, LPGear, TurntableNeedles, NeedleDoctor, VoiceOfMusic."

vinyl,3c5p29,ameliaxx,7,Sun Jul 5 01:33:47 2015 UTC,"I began collecting records towards the end of 2014 when my boyfriend (/u/allanr847) would bring me along to different record stores in the area. I thought the process of how vinyl records and turntables worked was very fascinating and wanted to get into the hobby of collecting and listening as well. I bought my boyfriend a new Uturn Audio Orbit Plus turntable for Christmas, back when it took 5-6 weeks to arrive. As we began to listen to his records, I fell even more in love with the idea of my own setup. I kept saying that I would buy myself a turntable for months but never pulled the trigger until late April. I finally completed my setup around mid May and have continued to expand my record collection and my interest in genres as well.     My setup includes Uturn Audio Orbit Plus turntable, Audioengine A5+ speakers, and a Behringer Microphono PP400 phono preamp     Like many other redditors, I chose to use an Ikea Kallax shelving unit. I made a customized backing out of a piece of plywood. I cut the plywood down to size, stained it using an ebony finish, drilled hole to run the wires of the lights through the individual cubbies, and drilled it onto the back of the shelving unit. The top row of the shelf is designated to 12, 10, & 7 inch records, as well as shaped records and old rap albums. The bottom row is designated to my premed & MCAT studying materials and other miscellaneous books."

vinyl,3c7049,nevermind4790,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:58:55 2015 UTC,"The Pioneer has a low mass arm, which suits high compliance cartridges. The 2M Red is more suited for medium mass tonearms, ie. Pro-jects which come standard with it.  Edit: Also, the 2M Red weighs 7.2 grams, which is the upper end of the PL-4's range of suitable cartridges (3-8 grams). I once owned a similar model Pioneer - same tonearm and tonearm assembly including the counterweight - and had difficulty properly setting the tracking force of the cartridge I mounted on it. It was a P-mount cart with the standard mount adapter. I can't specifics on what that cartridge plus adapter weighed, but I'm certain it was near that 8 gram limit. I had to use my tracking scale to set the tracking force, and with it set up at the maximum recommended for the cartridge (1.5 grams), the counterweight was on the edge of the tonearm where it screwed on.  It would have been impossible for me to set the tracking force without the scale, otherwise the tracking force would have been way off. It's possible you have the same problem with the 2M Red and your Pioneer. I don't see tracking scales as a necessity, except in extreme circumstances like pairing an extremely light/heavy cartridge, or making a counterweight out of blu tack (or really anything, like tire weights) to replace a missing counterweight."
vinyl,3c7049,goldswimmerb,2,Tue Jul 7 14:08:26 2015 UTC,Are you sure the  counterweight and allignment are proper?
vinyl,3c7049,MrRom92,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:21:37 2015 UTC,yup. Fidgeted with the weight from between 1.5-2.0 And re-calibrated it and re-alligned it multiple times
vinyl,3c7049,t90fan,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:58:20 2015 UTC,"As you go up the 2m line, precise alignment becomes more critical. You can't ""think"" you have aligned it properly… you've gotta know. It's either right or wrong, and when it's wrong, it sure won't sound right. This isn't necessarily as much an issue on the red as it is on the black or white, being that they are much more sensitive to mistracking but still generally a good idea to get it as close as you possibly can. If it is spot-on, perhaps another alignment standard would work in your favor?"
vinyl,3c7049,rowmaxrow,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:21:18 2015 UTC,"It does seem to be a strange quirk of that line. I've got a 540 which is an older one, placing above the red quality wise,  and I find it to not care too much."

vinyl,3c5kk0,theatreofpain,2,Wed Jul 8 17:59:10 2015 UTC,"Is it really sealed? To be honest to me it just looks like is in a resealable outer sleeve. In any case, that's on Fame - EMI had a ""Fame"" series for budget-priced reissues of less popular albums in the 1980s. So definitely not original. All in all, still cool, should sound pretty good especially if it's practically as new. Certainly not original though.  If it is sealed - importing records became slightly more commonplace in the late-70's/80's, and since records sold in the U.S. were almost always shrinkwrapped, the distributors or the retailers would seal em themselves. This of course was not factory sealed though and it's basically a reseal, except in those cases you can reasonably expect the record inside to be as new."

Good food and good drinks, with an upstairs record shop featuring vintage and reissue records.   The pinnacle however has to be these booths with built in record players and speakers, pick a record and listen with a beer! Heaven. Although there is only 4 booths so expect a wait, people seemed to really enjoy it and discuss everyone's selection.  Fairly good prices although a pretty limited catalogue. Around £7 for vintage, news £20 upwards. Pretty cool place and has to add to the must visit record shops in Liverpool!

But you asked the community to identify the turntable that's right for you and didn't do anything to narrow it down for us. Saying you want a ""nice mid-level turntable: new or used"" and throwing out a $400 budget doesn't show a lot of effort on your part.  I posted the resource from the sidebar because you, a self-identified ""new one"" to the vinyl records community, came off as if you had no idea where to begin. Rather than start throwing out specific turntable brands and models off the bat, I figured it'd be better for you to go through the funnel so you can start narrowing down the kind of turntable you're looking for or the turntable that might be best fit for your wants/needs/interests.

vinyl,3c217r,dude_why_would_you,30,Mon Jul 6 00:00:22 2015 UTC,"and what's awesome is the lady closed the store down and literally told me to take all I can. She had so many speakers I had to take pictures just to bring the info home to do research on them all. She had Harman Kardon turntables, Technics Speakers and a bunch of receivers. She'll open the store up tomorrow just for me and some buddies because she knows we are excited to dig through her stuff. I'm stoked. She had a bunch of other Heavy Metal records too but that'll have to wait until tomorrow. I caught her just as she was locking the store up around dinner time."
vinyl,3c217r,Stonerface,4,Sat Jul 4 01:05:40 2015 UTC,Jesus christ I need to start going to thrift shops regularly.
vinyl,3c217r,Broncos_Fan,48,Sat Jul 4 01:19:52 2015 UTC,"Don't get your hopes up too high. Church music, Christmas music and Andy Williams: I check my shops weekly and that's all they ever have. My best score ever was a Fleetwood Mac album. I also found the cover for Pink Floyd once, but the record was missing, of course."
vinyl,3c217r,serialaccountkiller,37,Sat Jul 4 02:10:22 2015 UTC,"I've been on this sub for a while, but this is the first time I've actually seen someone state the truth about thrift stores that matches my experience. This sub makes a thrift store seem like a magical land where rare or desirable vinyl grows on trees. It's literally exactly what you said. Oh and Barbara Streisand.  But for me, I have never ever seen any equipment worth anything at a thrift store."
vinyl,3c217r,11equals7,7,Sat Jul 4 04:39:08 2015 UTC,"Scratched and otherwise mistreated mediocre soundtracks of 32 year old mainstream movies in unbelievably damaged covers are also quite regular.   And the odd copy of Oxygène, of course."
vinyl,3c217r,serialaccountkiller,5,Sat Jul 4 12:43:46 2015 UTC,"Ha! Damaged covers is a given. it's just a record sandwiched by two loose papers that used to be a cover.  I will say they are good for Pavarotti records, got a few of those."
vinyl,3c217r,tambrico,4,Sat Jul 4 12:49:56 2015 UTC,yeah I visited like 6 local thrift shops after seeing some of the awesome finds people got on here. I was expecting to find some awesome stuff. but it's all shit

Most thrift stores (at least in my experience, and I work at one) are usually like this:  Records: choir and church music, sing along with mitch, herb alpert, barbara streisand, oklahoma soundtrack, goodyear christmas albums, lots and lots of classical, and one recognizable album that's too scratched up to play  Speakers: POS speakers taken from old 90s/00s shelf stereos, giant but terrible outdoor/bar/church speakers, one vintage pair in questionable condition with a high price tag  Stereo Equipment: Black plastic 90s/00s receivers, tape decks, unwanted CD and DVD players, if you're lucky there'll be one turntable missing the dustcover that either has no counterweight or is obviously busted"

vinyl,3c4kcu,nevermind4790,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:33:45 2015 UTC,Everything is set up perfect. Maybe the antiskate is a bit off? Tracking force is set to ~1.7g with the brush down. Not sure what to set the antiskate to. It's about the same as the tracking force. I'm looking for a new needle at the moment. Probably jico or similar
vinyl,3c4kcu,LaserRanger,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:45:01 2015 UTC,Incorrect anti-skate isn't going to cause skipping.
vinyl,3c4kcu,serialaccountkiller,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:47:43 2015 UTC,Alright time for a new needle! Got it.
vinyl,3c4kcu,chippewhattha,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:53:32 2015 UTC,"Not saying I don't believe you, but I used to think everything was set up perfect on my setup and I was having some trouble. It probably was fine when I set it up originally, but maybe something happened that threw it off whack. Never hurts to double check. Use the right protractor, overhang gauge, make sure the screws are not too tight or loose (and make sure the cartridge is perfect in all x,y,z dimensions not just x,y. I check with careful use of a level). Then after this, obviously re-balance. If, after cleaning the record, you still have the same quality concerns then probably the needle. If you're going to make a $100+ investment, it's worth double or triple checking."
vinyl,3c4kcu,gdmfr,2,Sun Jul 5 20:39:43 2015 UTC,"I should probably invest in proper alignment equipment first. I'll buy a proper force scale and everything soon, before I buy the jico"

Shame they didn't last very long, but any band with Steve Albini and two other strong personalities is going to be fraught.  I've got The Thrown-Ups album at home. I've had it since I was sixteen, when it turned up in a local store that mostly stocked classic rock and the like. Members of Mudhoney messing about, pretty much. It's terrible in a good way."

vinyl,3c46f5,Kerfulfel,11,Sat Jul 4 17:31:39 2015 UTC,"It's a double album (well, two ""books""), it's great, and it shows a wide range of musical styles. There's gangsta rap (""Ambitionz Az A Ridah""), introspective serious songs (""Life Goes On""), funky party rap (""California Love""); for example. White Album is all over the place as well.  One could also argue that they both represent the ""beginning of the end"" for the artists' careers. White Album was the height of the Beatles' inability to work together, culminating in their break up. All Eyez On Me was recorded after 2Pac had been bailed out of prison, shortly before his demise."

vinyl,3c46f5,adamsandleryabish,0,Sat Jul 4 19:06:45 2015 UTC,"It's possibly hands down, the most influential album in hip hop.  People have created entire careers mimicking only certain elements of the album. Tupac had wide range, and in this album he clusterfucks them all together yet it doesn't feel scattered. Some artists mimic the introspective songs, the gangster songs, the soft songs.   It's not my favorite Tupac album, but god damn does it stand the test of time."
vinyl,3c46f5,thefroggfather,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:44:33 2015 UTC,"I've always found it to be a very overrated album. Even if it was half the length, producing a good album would still be a struggle. Pre-Death Row Tupac was amazing, jumping in with Suge Knight brought out the worst in him."

vinyl,3c4u1t,ApproachingZero,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:20:45 2015 UTC,I think it maybe stems from some of the gimmick color pressings that DO sound worse. Glow-in-the-dark and record with glitter in them do sound a bit worse than traditional colored/black vinyl. Maybe someone heard that and lumped in all colored vinyl? I'm not sure.
vinyl,3c4u1t,fungunzbuff,0,Sun Jul 5 17:20:10 2015 UTC,"That would be my guess, people will find problems with anything. If that fancy colored record sounds worse then it's because of the pressing.  Pictures disks on the other hand usually are garbage."
vinyl,3c4u1t,JustinSchwimmer,7,Sun Jul 5 04:57:54 2015 UTC,"I own both colored and black vinyl, there isn't any noticeable difference. In fact I prefer getting colored vinyl because it looks way cooler."
vinyl,3c4u1t,ninfan200,4,Sat Jul 4 21:44:01 2015 UTC,It depends on the pressing. I have some great picture discs
vinyl,3c4u1t,dairydevil,2,Sat Jul 4 22:18:14 2015 UTC,"Picture disc quality in recent years has increased significantly. But yeah, older picture discs generally don't sound great because it is a totally different manufacturing technique than a regular black or coloured pressing"
vinyl,3c4u1t,darkeyelidz,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:35:53 2015 UTC,"Regular black LPs are easiest to inspect for scratches or scuffs when buying used. Translucent ones are tougher, and picture discs are the worst."
vinyl,3c4u1t,LordClinton,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:44:56 2015 UTC,"It's not bullshit. Ultra Clear and picture disc vinyl does not sound as good as black or most other colors.

So here it is I first just wanna say that I payed quite abit for all of these albums and you might not think they were worth that much but living in Northern Sweden its not easy to get records so I though it was. Hope you all enjoy! :)

vinyl,3c2h24,beige4ever,5,Sat Jul 4 03:54:58 2015 UTC,"So I went into my local record store, and I got these two because they were records I really wanted, but considered to expensive to buy (Songs for the Deaf was $80 CAD and Relationship of Command was $40 CAD) but after 13 years in school I thought I deserved a treat. When I went up to the counter, the guy looked at QOTSA and said ""You must really like this record, because it is crazy expensive"". And he was right. These are two of my favourite albums of all time, so having them in my collection is great. There was a dent in the corner of ATDI that I didn't notice until I got home, but even still I love it. I listened to QOTSA today, and it was amazing, but I'm probably never going to listen to it again, because I want to keep it perfect (haha)"
vinyl,3c2h24,DOMAN127,6,Sat Jul 4 03:43:51 2015 UTC,Is the Songs for the Deaf a bootleg?
vinyl,3c2h24,atarigw,2,Sat Jul 4 04:27:27 2015 UTC,"While there is nothing inherently wrong with a bootleg (other than it is just not officially, sound quality is not necessarily worse), it does seem like the price is steep compared to what I'm seeing on Discogs.  That being said, since you are Canadian and prices tend to be a bit higher and Canada, and often records like this are harder to come by (maybe it's something about the great white north that makes records harder to get), the price inflation on your purchase might not be the worst, but still isn't necessarily justified.  However, the value to you is probably significant, and getting it from a store versus having to ship it likely internationally is probably something to consider as well in the cost factor.    Anyways though, at the very least both are great albums.  I know that Cedric and Omar have talked about how the production and mixing on Relationship of Command was really not to their liking, and I hope to someday see a really good remix/remaster of the album per their choices. (Although I worry that because Omar is so not into ATDI, it might not happen with his input.  Which is really too bad, considering ATDI is so much better than any post Goliath Mars Volta material)"
vinyl,3c2h24,anniefourtwo,2,Sat Jul 4 13:14:24 2015 UTC,"Sorry to break it down to ya, but the qotsa album you got is a bootleg (seeing that it has an EU tag on it). It's a really nice sounding bootleg though, but worth no where close to 80$ cad."
vinyl,3c2h24,anniefourtwo,4,Sat Jul 4 06:57:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah but I don't mind. I kinda went into the store with the mindset of ""fuck it I'm gonna spend a lot of money""  I wanted an extravagant album to Celebrate"

Your other option is a U-Turn orbit but you'd have to additionally buy a preamp. Does your amp by any chance have a phono input?

The owner had a few crates of vinyl records, so I was browsing through them. She invited me to take a look in their cellar because she had a bunch more.   When I got down there and saw this, my jaw dropped. There are dozens of milk crates, plus a few other shelves of 60's, 70's, and 80's rock, jazz, and some other styles of tunes. Unfortunately, no Talking Heads (a current favorite).  I picked up these five for $20 total, which is far cheaper than anywhere else that I know of.

vinyl,3c4kn7,GeckoDeLimon,2,Sat Jul 4 21:55:10 2015 UTC,"what surprises me is that old records tend not to get infested as much as one would expect. I have unsleeved one or two flea market finds that yielded a dead silverfish or spider, but nothing too bad.  the thing I am weary of now is bedbugs. I just read about them ... yuck."
vinyl,3c4kn7,beige4ever,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:31:10 2015 UTC,"Unless the collection was stored up against furniture in a heavily infested house then you're more than likely safe. The chance of an infestation coming from a record is pretty low. Maybe if a record was displayed over or near a bed that was heavily infested and immediately sold/dropped off at a Thrift Store you'd have a problem. Bed Bugs like tight, soft & warm spaces.   Source: had bedbugs and it was one of the worst experiences in my life."

It's not a hi-fi unit, and even optimally setup, it won't produce quality sound. If the sound was acceptable to you at some point and now seems lacking, it may be that the stylus needs to be replaced.  It appears the cartridge is a Tetrad T2md.

vinyl,3c4iuq,elmosworld37,2,Sat Jul 4 18:31:13 2015 UTC,"The QBert OM is a DJ cartridge/stylus combo. It is based on the OM line (as the name would suggest) but is different than the original OM or Super OM carts in that it has a much higher output. Apparently some complain about distortion because of this, but that may be due to individual setups.  Because it's a DJ cart, the stylus tracks fairly heavy. But since it's part of the OM line, you can swap the stylus out for something like an OM10 for a much more sane tracking weight and an upgrade in sound too."
vinyl,3c4iuq,GothamCountySheriff,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:51:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah I checked the specs and the recommended tracking force was 3g, which did seem pretty high. I did notice a bit of distortion when listening at high volumes, too.  Since I'm only a casual listener and not a DJ, I'll probably get a different cart."
vinyl,3c4iuq,GothamCountySheriff,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:08:23 2015 UTC,"3g isn't terrible, but if you can go lower, then it would be better for the records. The SL-D303 has a nice, medium-mass tonearm, so most cartridges will work well on it."
vinyl,3c4iuq,beige4ever,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:26:20 2015 UTC,Any ortofon is likely to be decent. Does the needle slide off? Many ortofon have a replaceable stylus
vinyl,3c4iuq,vinyl_eyes,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:37:06 2015 UTC,"The Om cartridge is on the low end of The Ortofon selection but it's still Ortofon so it is pretty decent. If you want an upgrade, try the 2M Red and see if you notice a difference."

vinyl,3c3pd7,goose-is-good,3,Sat Jul 4 13:47:09 2015 UTC,I have this exact turntable... and I love it. I wish I could help. :( Best of luck to you!
vinyl,3c3pd7,baitXtheXnoose,2,Sat Jul 4 18:17:46 2015 UTC,So this is a automatic turntable? Which is to say if you hit a button the arm lifts and moves to the beginning of the record and at the end lifts and moves back to the rest? If so it may be getting stuck in that cycle and needs to finish. This can happen if you move the arm during the beginning or ending cycle. Try turning the turntable with your fingers and see if the resistance disappears after half a minute or so.

Even if it only has 200 hours on it, there's a chance it could have gotten damaged.  Have you considered staying with the Pro-ject and just upgrading the Ortofon stylus? The OM5E can accept the OM10/20/30/40 styli."
vinyl,3c37xs,nevermind4790,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:40:46 2015 UTC,"Well that would be maybe a better way to go. I was going towards the GR because there seemed to be more upgrades for the GR. I was able to finally find an online store that sells the full lineup of Pro-ject upgrades.  I'm going to upgrade the stylus, get an acrylic plate and a clamp for the essential instead."
vinyl,3c37xs,barnfry,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:34:11 2015 UTC,"Three things to be concerned about.   Unverifiable history. Wear from Use. Ageing of the cartridge independent of use.   Number 1 is a caveat emptor situation, number 2 is actually much less of a real problem than most people think, but in my experience, number 3 is the one you just can't get away from.   The primary problem I've witnessed with older carts is that the suspension system, which in almost all cases is based on some form of rubber-like elastomer compound, will get stiff over time, and the cart will lose it's ability to resolve fine detail. This problem is actually worsened if the cartridge was used sparingly or not at all. A ""New Old Stock Cartridge"" is something I would run away from as fast as I could. A cart that had been used regularly over the years won't hold quite as much of a grip on the grooves as a new one will, but will generally still play."

So when I realized how sick I was of simply putting record jackets on the floor while listening, I decided to do something about it. Rather than go to a hobby shop and buy some kind of easel, I went with what I knew and owned plenty of: LEGO.  I decided on a color—a riveting gray—and separated every light and dark piece I had. Without any real design idea, I went to building. Two and a half hours later, and I have a hand-made LEGO jacket stand.  I don't know about you all, but I'm happy with the results.

vinyl,3c1enn,informationscientist,2,Fri Jul 3 22:09:41 2015 UTC,"My collection is on discogs - med. value is about $12k. You were able to add this on to the policy that you already had? Do you happen to know if it's insured all as one collection, or per piece?"
vinyl,3c1enn,informationscientist,2,Fri Jul 3 22:15:27 2015 UTC,"yep, mine is as an itemized ""collection"", it would take a lot of damage to equal my deductible as I only have a handful of significant value, but I could provide per-item if needed..  when I get above my coverage level I see it in discogs and make a call."
vinyl,3c1enn,dallasdude,2,Fri Jul 3 23:22:52 2015 UTC,"Read your insurance policy. Phonograph records are likely covered as contents/personal property. Check the valuation: actual cash value or replacement cost? Check insurance to value-- a large collection means your default personal property limit might be inadequate. You can also request a separate collectibles limit. While this might technically not be needed under many HO policies, it does have the benefit of making the coverage intent very clear and lists a separate limit specifically for collectibles.  Insurance will exclude certain things such as flood, warping/temperature change, mold, fungus, damage from insects/vermin etc. Items held for sale, taken off site, stored off site, etc might need specialized coverage.   Some carriers might be unwilling to insure a very large collection, and others might require an appraised inventory.  I recommend taking some pictures and videos to support your claim and help document the collection in event of a loss.  Tl;Dr read your policy, get an insurance agent that knows what they're doing, read your policy, understand what you're reading, and also read your policy. Did I mention, read your policy. Not to sound like a broken record, but so many people don't even read the contract they pay money for."

He really didn't want anything too valuable, mostly dollar bin stuff, and ended up picking 14 out of my collection and I picked 14 from his. Then he brought out this Zeppelin album, in its paper bag, FUCKING SEALED. And the best part? He didn't give a shit. He just wanted his Beatles and Minglewood band.

I was given a lot of vinyl by my mom, who collected them when she was younger - so I have about 100 to start my collection, mostly classic rock - though I plan on buying a lot of modern albums myself.  Along with these speakers, I also got a Kenwood KA-128 receiver/amp, and two Paisley Monitors SPL-3000 for speakers.  All in all, this costed me $285 CAD ($226 USD).

I used it a lot, especially when I went to college at a place with an amazing public library collection of albums.  But they were transitioning to CD (as was I) - and I had grown tired of what I understood to be the inescapable limitations of the format, especially IGD which had bugged me even as a kid.  (I grew up in a radio station, so records were always a huge part of my life). I also didn't see a way to clean a record properly that didn't involve buying an expensive vacuum device that cost three times as much as my turntable.  That table had no adjustable counterweight and was P-mount only.  The information we share here was much harder to come-by on the early 1990's Internet. I'm much happier now that I've learned how to address the alignment and cleaning problems, and have a 1200 with an AT 440MLA.  Will probably go for the JICO SAS upgrade for the Shure M97xe now that I've heard the difference a well-calibrated fine-line stylus makes."

vinyl,3c0sbd,Emergencygeek,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:56:23 2015 UTC,They work really well especially if you have a ton of static on your record. If you have only minor pops and cracks when listening you can try a carbon brush. When using it to clean your record move it inwards and touch it to the spindle it can discharge some minor static. If you live in a dry area that can also effect static. A little humidity helps out to decrease static too.

Folk reminiscent of Lightfoot and James Taylor, the acoustic guitar work is nearly as smooth as his glorious glistening chest.  With vocals as raspy as the magnificent mustache that resides above his manly chin, this fantastic example of 70‘s country folk should be in everyone’s collection. Whether framed on a wall to showcase the cover's glowing masculinity, or played for your friends in a beer infused orgy of blatant manliness, this album screams that you are comfortable with your sexuality and no one can tell you otherwise.

Pirate or Counterfeit Pressing: Material that IS available legally, with the seller attempting to, superficially at least, pass his product off as a legitimate pressing.  Both have the same legality and quality control issues.

vinyl,3bzd3g,arkayeast,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:19:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah I bought that Mellow Gold boot. It's pretty murky and quiet as hell. Straight from the CD but it has less definition. Listen to the hihat on Loser on the CD. Now listen to it on the boot. Oh wait there is none because it sucks.   Yeah I regret that purchase. Should have bought the $30 Guero instead since it seems even that one is worth dumb money these days.   Also yeah always ask about records that seem to be too good to be true. Or are suspiciously flimsy. I went to Waterloo and saw a lot of fake records in with the real ones which bothered me. A lot of stores do this but plenty will at least mark on it ""unofficial"" or something. But always ask just in case."
vinyl,3bzd3g,PerceptionShift,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:15:30 2015 UTC,Wow Guero is hard to find now? That one and Guerolito were like $15 everywhere for years.
vinyl,3bzd3g,dallasdude,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:51:53 2015 UTC,Guerolito is still everywhere but Guero can be a little tough. I've had a number of chances to get it and never did because it's not my favorite. Maybe one of these days but that's what I keep on saying.  There was a rumor of a Mellow Gold reissue this year but I am skeptical it's happening. I did see some press stuff on Beck's FB that looked like a new album though so I'll at least take new Beck.
vinyl,3bzd3g,PerceptionShift,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:44:37 2015 UTC,Careful what you wish for! I heard his new single on the radio a couple of times. It sounds like bubble gum pop  you'd hear on KISS FM. I sure hope the whole album isn't that bad.
vinyl,3bzd3g,dallasdude,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:44:19 2015 UTC,"I didn't know the single was out. You're right though, its really poppy. Poptimism at its finest. Now I kinda maybe like it because I secretly like some of that tacky dancepop shit, and I have some faith that Beck can make more intelligent dancepop type stuff. Buuut, I also don't like how straight up pop it is like you said. It feels like theres depth but then you realize its so 2009 indiepop. I was really hoping the new album would sound like those three singles he released back at the end of 2013. There's a little bit of that, but this feels far more middle of the road than those tracks did.   He probably heard 1989 and realized he could be a genuine pop star after the Grammy win."
vinyl,3bzd3g,PerceptionShift,3,Sat Jul 4 19:56:12 2015 UTC,"i have an aenima boot and i think it sounds great, i picked it up only because i can't afford a real copy and i got to listen to it before buying. Plus boots are a strange part of collecting vinyl. I'd say go for it."

vinyl,3bwgj1,GothamCountySheriff,3,Thu Jul 2 21:34:13 2015 UTC,"So I've been collecting for years and have recently got back into it again. I was killing time before a dental appointment and decided to hit up the thrift store next door to look for LaserDiscs. After searching I see buried under a pile of trash a seriously rough looking player, a Technics SL-20 to be exact. It was half off so I figured $20 $15 is an okay gamble and I decide to buy it. I swing by my local electronics store and the proprietor sets everything up and ads a new needle for $25.   It's fully manual but sounds immaculate. The LPs were found at a St. Vinnie's in coastal Oregon, they were all in amazing near mint condition. I think I paid around $30 for everything and $20 for The Smiths. If anyone knows much about the player let me know!  Notable finds out of list -  New Order - Power, Corruption & Lies (Reissue) The Smiths - Hatfull of Hollow (orig Pressing) Nitzer Ebb - That Total Age (Orig Pressing) Back to the Future Soundtrack & Rolling Stones - Beggars Banquet (unknown pressing)  Edit:grammar"
vinyl,3bwgj1,GothamCountySheriff,2,Thu Jul 2 18:42:00 2015 UTC,Nice stuff. I own Smiths reissues but I  just picked up a Hatful first pressing - was really thrown off by the Rough Trade label!   How's that copy of Beggars Banquet? It seems like every copy I see is super banged up. Hard to find a playable version around here.
vinyl,3bwgj1,GothamCountySheriff,2,Thu Jul 2 19:16:05 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty happy with the condition of Hatfull as well, it's not mint but it's pretty close and for one that came from the UK I'm glad to have found it. The copy of Beggars is actually quite good. The cover had been hit with mold/mildew of which I was only able to get some of it off. The vinyl itself was dirty too but not from abuse or a bad player just a lot of dirt. I cleaned it up and it sounds pretty damn good on my shitty Sony player, no idea yet on the Technics. I have no idea what pressing Beggars is as Discogs has like 40 different versions of this LP with the same production code."
vinyl,3bwgj1,beige4ever,3,Thu Jul 2 19:54:40 2015 UTC,"Nice scores! New Order - Power Corruption & Lies is a fantastic album, and certainly my favorite New Order disc. I still haven't located an OG copy in the wild, but I do have its companion piece -- the Blue Monday 12"" (in the die-cut floppy jacket). Of course The Smith s/t is a classic. Not sure where most people stand, but I really love Songs From The Big Chair and it's a close race between it and Peter Gabriel - So as to my favorite top 40 album from the '80s.  Thanks for sharing."
vinyl,3bwgj1,PeanutButter707,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:46:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've really been into it. I would love to come across an original pressing someday. They're seem to be a ton of reissues of it. It's also much more accessible than their first LP imo. Also Songs from the Big Chair is a classic.  I'd love to come across one of those blue Monday 12"" one day,  I saw a beat up copy once years ago and passed one it."
vinyl,3bwgj1,PeanutButter707,3,Thu Jul 2 21:10:36 2015 UTC,"As the years roll on, I'm realizing that I like New Order's stuff between 1981 and 1985 way more than I like Joy Division."
vinyl,3bwgj1,LaserRanger,2,Thu Jul 2 21:49:39 2015 UTC,I love Unknown Pleasures but Closer & New Orders Movement not so much. They're good don't get me wrong but I feel that their second LP is the real them.
vinyl,3bwgj1,Perceptualdoor,2,Thu Jul 2 22:33:12 2015 UTC,"Funny because in recent years I've heard a sort of critical reappraisal of Closer as the better of the two LPs. And for me, personally, I think Movement's just shy of Unknown Pleasures, and somewhat better than Closer. I suspect those are unpopular opinions.   For me, I think I like the New Order EPs and singles all the way up to Shellshock better than the LPs. I don't know, it's hard to say. I move around on the issue a bit. But I guess that's the thing, I've probably worn out JD long ago - their LPs feel a bit monolithic to me. New Order seems more vital. But again, just my ears talking there. I still probably think that, as a finished document, Unknown Pleasures is the strongest (though An Ideal For Living strikes me as being somewhat underrated given the popularity of JD). But I think I ""like"" the New Order LPs, EPs, and singles best."
vinyl,3bwgj1,yellowtag,2,Fri Jul 3 00:20:53 2015 UTC,"Maybe my love for it is somewhat anchored in the overall critical acclaim it has. I need to give closer another go, hopefully I'll come across one. I'm looking forward to digging into New Orders catalog."
vinyl,3bwgj1,lpmiller,2,Fri Jul 3 00:29:25 2015 UTC,"I'm going to disagree with you on Closer. To me, it's the most realized and consistent statement of the Joy Division catalog. But I will agree with you on Movement. While I like Movement, I don't think it really represents New Order well as a band of their own. It's very much a continuation of what Joy Division was doing with Closer. But Power, Corruption & Lies is definitely the album where New Order found their voice as a band. It set the template for everything that came afterward (or at least through Republic)."
vinyl,3bwgj1,lpmiller,2,Fri Jul 3 04:06:21 2015 UTC,"I really need to give it another go, it's been years since I listened to Closer. I got Unknown Pleasures at the same time and gravitated to it more. You're the second person to tell me to spin it so I will see if my shop has it tomorrow during their 4th of July sale."
vinyl,3bwgj1,blacksheepaz,2,Fri Jul 3 04:22:23 2015 UTC,"You know, for me, I like Movement precisely because it's Joy Division sans-Curtis. Now I know people on average wouldn't like that comment, but for me I almost like the band better without its mascot. I'm not using that term in a derogatory way, either - at least not toward Curtis himself. It's more a comment on how romanticized Ian's story, and especially his suicide, has become in the popular imagination. Don't get me wrong, I love Ian Curtis, his vocals, his weird style, and I can find his story somewhat romantic (though hardly cinematic) like people do. But when it comes down to the architecture of a band, Curtis isn't what does it for me about Joy Division. He's unique, and interesting, and lends a fantastic atmosphere, and was a very good lyricist, and in some ways visionary, but I think the band works either way - and is almost more interesting when you hear the thing so closely stitched to a single voice without it.   So I'm thinking here especially of Dreams Never End, which, I think, stands next to just about any song Ian Curtis was present on and is, moreover, maybe a bit more interesting precisely because he isn't there. Movement generally speaking is like that for me."
vinyl,3bwgj1,cabebedlam,2,Fri Jul 3 04:30:20 2015 UTC,"I think the fact that it sounds like Joy Division sans Ian Curtis is a testament to the collaborative effort that Joy Division was and how much input the other members had on the sound of the band. I think that the other band members gets eclipsed by the ""martyrdom"" of Curtis and also how the Joy Division mythology gets promoted.   The other reason I think Movement sounds so much like Joy Division is the production values of Martin Hannett. He had a very signature production sound for the albums and singles he worked on with Joy Division and New Order. And while they still are rooted in that Joy Division sound, their live stuff (that isn't veiled by Hannett's producution) from the Movement era shows that they were pushing past the Joy Division sound. This becomes even more apparent on singles in between the albums like Everything's Gone Green, where Hannett apparently left mid-production due to artistic differences between him and the band."
vinyl,3bwgj1,beige4ever,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:23:07 2015 UTC,yes that Joy Division was a landmark of that era is undisputable. New Order up til and including Brotherhood for me... 'Bizarre Love Triangle' is their most-covered song
vinyl,3bwgj1,beige4ever,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:18:48 2015 UTC,"I can definitely get down with Brotherhood, I just don't know if I like listening to it more than JD at that point. Suffice it to say, New Order: awesome."

The one time I saw it in a record store it was a choice between an expensive brand new one or an even more expensive audiophile one. I bought it on cassette at a goodwill once just to be able to listen to the album for now, but it turned to to be ruined and unplayable."

vinyl,3bxr40,theothea,25,Fri Jul 3 00:57:18 2015 UTC,"Lots of teenage girls come into our store buying Lana Del Rey and Taylor Swift records grouped in with some other stuff they heard to be vaguely interesting, like Nirvana or a Pink Floyd album. It's not surprising to have Taylor Swift so high, but Sufjan was definitely a surprise. Anyways, these girls are usually playing stuff on a system owned by their parents, and they usually come back for more recommendations (one girl bought a Jenny Lewis album after I showed her the video for Just One Of The Guys).   Don't crap on girls (and guys) who are young and buying radio hits. After all, that's why everyone who lived in the sixties/seventies/eighties has a copy of a Chuck Mangione album, ABBA, Neil Diamond, Eddie Money or Herb Alpert. They're putting money into a business that needs help being revived, who cares what they do with it."

vinyl,3bxr40,isthishandletaken,-7,Fri Jul 3 17:16:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I wonder where those teenage girls will be in five years. In your shop, you think? I doubt that very much.   Trend hopping bullshit ends up where the other shit you described ends up... in the black holes of stores who will never sell the piles of them they can't refuse any more of fast enough.   I wonder why people are forgetting this point. Vinyl is a niche medium and will never, I repeat, will never, ever, ever become the dominant medium of music ever again. It had its day, it is momentarily resurrected from its death, and will again die. Ten years from now, the people who are listening to vinyl will be the people who have been listening to vinyl. The people who maintain the niche concept and community of the niche medium.   Taylor Swift records are nothing but future items to further expand the borders of the garbage dump. These records don't even exist in the present. They exist in moments, fractions of moments, and then do nothing more than to announce their death. No one will remember this record in five years, no one will want it, no one will care.   But in the meantime, we can pretend that this kind of shit is what's helping the medium. Helping how? Did Swift's record, its sales, its production, its popularity in any way help the production and distribution of local bands, scenes, and the archival reissuing of hard-to-find records? Did it do anything other than, along with the other mass-produced nothing-but-sugar music, take up space and time in the limited number of pressing plants?  I think people here are incredibly naive. Vinyl is a trend, a bubble, for 99% of the people who use it as a medium now. Sonically, vinyl offers very little in terms of a hierarchy of quality. It's increasingly expensive, increasingly exploited, and increasingly trivialized. Taylor Swift doesn't help listeners with anything, including the anecdote of teenage girls finding supposedly more vital or meaningful music as a result of going into the store. Those girls, when they're slightly older, will throw away the Nirvana and Pink Floyd as quickly and painlessly as they throw away the Swift."

Always came off as a nice enough teen singer, but her songs were always so clearly written by a teenage girl they always got brushed aside. But a little with her last album, and more with this, the songs are so much more fun. Catchy as shit, but I love the girly-pop edge to them. Most of the album is ""You're hot, I'm hot, we like fucking, let's fuck."" Much more relate-able, much more enjoyable. Huge step forward.

From what most of the store owners are telling me, it seems young girls are the main ones for the recent surge. Sure you always have young guys looking for Led Zeppelin, but they never had the buying power that your seeing now. Most those guys and really just guys in general are pretty rigid with what they are looking for. Zeppelin, Stones, Delta blues, early RnB.

vinyl,3bz5ff,adayinalife,1 point,Fri Jul 3 09:50:24 2015 UTC,"This is what most ""veteran"" collectors do. Research for the best vinyl master and buy that one. Sometimes it's a reissue and sometimes it isn't. For the old albums, this is where reading the runout becomes a valuable skill.  Otherwise, it's collecting for the most ""valuable"" press which is usually the first run and/or most rare. Which has basically nothing to do with sound quality."

I am finding it difficult to source any high quality vintage vinyl for its actual value and not the inflated hipster pricing that's happening right now in my area. The reissues are pristine condition (with the exception of the Pink Floyd reissues, whatever happened there makes no sense) I enjoy a quiet piece of wax where its easy to distinguish the softer parts of the music more than paying the outrageous prices for a beat up vintage record. I have not had any disappointments with the mastering on reissues yet."

vinyl,3bz5ff,astrovinyl,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:05:52 2015 UTC,For me it's an economic question. I go for originals unless a high quality reissue is at a better price.

vinyl,3bz5ff,PerceptionShift,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:24:40 2015 UTC,I prefer original up until about $25. If the original is more than that then I will look at the reissue. Although I do prefer to get the best master so if there is a reissue with fairly better mastering I'll get that or vice versa. Depends on the genre and release year and stuff like that too. But the $25 rule holds pretty steady.
vinyl,3bz5ff,PerceptionShift,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:30:13 2015 UTC,Where are you from? In Australia reissues go for up to $50 and the originals go far beyond what I'd pay for a record unless it's something I really want.

A used, canonical album (the ones being reissued today) went for $6 - $8 if it was a nice clean copy.  Those that were a little more worn or a little less desirable went for $3 - $5.  That, by the way was either an hour or a half-hour of minimum wage work at that time.  Today, you have to work 3 - 4 hours at minimum wage to afford a new pressing of the same album.  I can't abide today's prices.  No album should cost more than $15."

The UK Revolver, Sgt Pepper and Yellow Submarine were all found with Pink Floyd in a shopping cart that was rolled onto the floor. The others were stacked together one random evening along with the O'Jays, Sam & Dave and The Supremes. THAT was a lucky find, I must say. I stopped by randomly on my way to the grocery store just to see what was going on. The girl standing next to me while I was giggling going through it all must've thought I was insane.

It just works into my commute and lunch schedule so well, and I often go with a coworker who got me into vinyl (he nearly cried when I showed him my first haul of Beatles and Floyd). Still, I have to pick through TONS of Manilow, Herb Alpert, Ray Conniff, Mantovani, Streisand, and Firestone Christmas albums to get to this stuff. Sometimes it comes in chunks, others it's one or two at a time. But I find that the best scores are when a person with good taste either gives up on the medium or flees the mortal coil, resulting in a fresh delivery of prime vinyl."

For new records, Amoeba's prices aren't outrageous, but they're not a bargain either. It's a huge store with many employees, in the heart of Hollywood, so there's a lot of overhead they need to cover. Their used records prices are kind of all over the place. You can find deals, but on average, I'd say they price their used stuff a little high."

Asked the girl at the front counter if they had any vinyl and she pulled out a milk crate with about 15 records poorly placed inside.  I took a look and was met with nothing but my little pony picture discs.  Never again...
vinyl,3bx4fa,KoopaTroopaz,2,Fri Jul 3 03:21:54 2015 UTC,"How did they store records there? I've heard horror stories about other stores, the one in my town has maybe 20-30 records total, mostly duplicates, and they just kinda throw them into some box thing, other than the expensive ones that are displayed more traditional record store style. I read about one guy that was in a store where they were literally hung on pants hangers like they were flags or something. Cringe worthy."
vinyl,3bx4fa,scabdick,3,Thu Jul 2 22:34:15 2015 UTC,Their selection is fairly limited.  They had a small bin but very poorly organized.  The top bin is set at about 5 1/2 feet so you have to reach up and grab one and take it out to see what it is.  They had maybe 30 different on clearance and the sale wasnt posted anywhere.  I grabed one and got the register when he told me it was buyone get one free.  These were stored fine but some of them were literally just a record inside a paper sleeve.
vinyl,3bx4fa,scabdick,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:12:06 2015 UTC,"They're just awful with vinyl in general, it seems. That sale seems pretty sweet to me but nothing at my local store grabbed me last I checked, although they did have a similar sale on their online store (buy 1 get 1 for $1) so I got a compilation of early Converge and the new Depeche Mode album for like $24, which was definitely sweet."

I love Brazilian music, so I was ecstatic to find the Antonio Carlos Jobim albums and the Sergio Mendes Album. I was also able to find a disco album by Don Ray, produced by one of my favorite disco artists, Cerrone.   I enjoy 60's sunshine pop acts like the 5th Dimension and The Association, so finding them for a cheap price was cool, and although I wasn't expecting to find them when I went to the store, James Gang Rides Again by the James Gang and Pyramid by The Alan Parsons Project are two good albums that were worth the price. Also, snagging some CTI albums is never a bad thing!  I got the Sly and the Family Stone and Zorba the Greek albums from the dollar bin for the hell of it.  I asked the owner if he had any The Meters albums, and he said he did, but he told me that they were an expensive repressing (One was 25 dollars, the same amount as all these albums in the pictures cost combined!).  One thing I'm really waiting for is to see if the owner gets any Kate Bush albums in. He had a few but they were Best Of's/Greatest Hits albums and the like. I like to get actual studio albums of artists when I can.  Also, sorry about the light in the second picture, the blue album is Crying Song by Hubert Laws."

vinyl,3bxbpr,mawnck,2,Fri Jul 3 02:17:38 2015 UTC,"No offense, OP, but this has me ROFL, because this is SO common and it seems nobody has been able to figure it out yet, despite the fact that there are about 10 million ""golden vinyl"" Tops Mayfair records in the thrift stores that this has happened to.  Some colored vinyl changes color over time. Especially yellow.  The most notorious user of the magic color-changing vinyl was the Tops-affiliated budget label Mayfair Records (and their subsidiaries Venise and Gold Award). They called it ""Golden Vinyl"" and the whole point was to show how pure their vinyl was as opposed to the sludge that most budget labels used. Obviously it would have been pretty stupid, therefore, to press them streaky or brown, but when you find their records today, most of them look like that Grand Funk album, or crazier. Examples:  http://www.ebay.com/itm/COLORED-VINYL-33-RPM-RECORD-LP-INK-SPOTS-IN-THE-SPOTLITE-MAYFAIR-LABEL-/391185647281  http://www.ebay.com/itm/The-Flirty-Thirties-Mayfair-Records-9654S-Lew-Raymond-Willow-Sisters-LOOK-/261948647561  http://www.ebay.com/itm/Raoul-Martinez-His-Orchestra-Cha-Cha-Cha-1959-Mary-Tyler-Moore-Mayfair-9659S-/351440863032  http://www.ebay.com/itm/Mel-Torme-Prelude-To-A-Kiss-1958-Jazz-Ballad-LP-Mayfair-9615S-Rare-Vinyl/391097327105  One that hasn't turned yet: http://www.ebay.com/itm/COLORED-VINYL-33-RPM-RECORD-LP-WALTZ-FAVORITES-MAYFAIR-LABEL-12-POP-/381310835897  Mayfair Records are common, so watch for them at your local Goodwill. While there were a few pressed on black vinyl, most were yellow. If you find any other color, it's because it's turned.  In case you're wondering, storage conditions don't seem to matter. And I've bought sealed ones that had turned brown inside the shrink. The color change doesn't seem to affect sound quality. They do eventually turn black, with just a glint of yellow around the very edge if you hold them up to a light.  I've seen transparent red vinyl go black over time as well, but that seems to be way less common.   So is your Grand Funk album rare, having been (apparently) pressed on the same vinyl Mayfair used? Eh, who knows? I haven't seen a lot of copies of this album recently, so I don't know how many of them are losing their chrominescent integrity. Bit I'm sure it'll be less rare as time goes on and more of them do the same thing.   Just FYI, I can tell from the photos that yours is legit. It's nearly impossible to fake a Capitol pressing from that period, since Capitol's presses put the label seam in a weird place.  It IS definitely cool looking. One thing about the color-changing vinyl is that the results can't be duplicated on purpose. Take that thing to a pressing plant and ask 'em if they can make you a record that looks just like that. They can't.  TL;DR: It WAS yellow when they pressed it, but then it turned red/brown/black/whatever."

To that I would say that even if you don't deserve to be late to work, sometimes there's a bigger picture than your day.

vinyl,3bub9o,YachtRock_SoSmooth,2,Thu Jul 2 16:55:18 2015 UTC,That one with the paint dripping is amazing.  Tutorial?
vinyl,3bub9o,YachtRock_SoSmooth,2,Fri Jul 3 04:59:28 2015 UTC,"The paint drips are just gobs of acrylic paint right from the bottles! You rest the lip of the bottle on the edge of the record and squeeze while moving it across. It can be thick so I wanted to see if I could peel the drips off of the old sleeve which I taped on the bottom (since it was glossy). It didn't work though. Some people cut their paint with water to make it drippier but it's really messy and isn't as bright... Looks more like watercolour.   This isn't the right sub, but if you're looking to do that on canvas, get a big three inch paint brush and squirt the paint right on there and drip it on. Don't clean in between colours because there's no point. Hopefully that helps."
vinyl,3bwp1v,NicknameP,6,Thu Jul 2 19:44:42 2015 UTC,"I prefer their first album, but I'm pretty sure I'm very nostalgically biased since it was an album that by the time I was 6, I was able to recite the whole thing word for word. But 2112 is great too. Moving Pictures is a definite classic too. Test For Echo is awesome. There's just a bunch of phenomenal Rush albums."
vinyl,3bwp1v,AwkBoss,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:50:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah i hear they have so many amazing records,  so hard to choose. Heard good things about moving pictures aswell."
vinyl,3bwp1v,mcfly_you_bojo,8,Thu Jul 2 19:53:08 2015 UTC,"I would say 2112, Moving Pictures, or Permanent Waves."
vinyl,3bwp1v,YourFriendJeebus,4,Thu Jul 2 20:17:53 2015 UTC,"Rush has an interesting and diverse discography. I think the best album to listen to first is Permanent Waves because it incorporates prog elements along with their transition to shorter more radio-friendly compositions. Also, if you haven't, try asking r/rush. They are an excellent resource for all Rush related info and questions."
vinyl,3bwp1v,LissenToMehNow,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:33:56 2015 UTC,"I own all their 70s and 80s albums on vinyl, and when it came to me purchasing one of the 2015 represses, I chose Permanent Waves, even though it's not my favorite album. So I agree with you."
vinyl,3bwp1v,TheBlindGuardian,5,Fri Jul 3 23:57:36 2015 UTC,"I really like Hemispheres and Farewell to Kings. I believe the two form one joint concept album (or at least two of the songs are connected). Closer to the Heart is one of my least favorite Rush songs, but those albums are phenomenal. La Villa Strangiato on Hemispheres is my favorite instrumental track ever."
vinyl,3bwp1v,chernicky,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:09:37 2015 UTC,Hemispheres is the correct answer.
vinyl,3bwp1v,CaptShitacular,4,Fri Jul 3 04:50:37 2015 UTC,"You really can't go wrong with any of their first 8 releases. Hell - though many will disagree with me here - their whole discography is solid. But If I had to offer up one album I'm actually going to name their most recent full length 'Clockwork Angels'. Not only is this the best Rush album since Moving Pictures, it's one of the best releases of 2012. It's heavy, it's catchy, emotional, superbly played, etc. etc. etc.  Everything that has and continues to make this band one of the greatest ever is on display on this album. And it's got a brilliant story behind it. Get it. Now."
vinyl,3bwp1v,DeuceSK,4,Thu Jul 2 21:27:06 2015 UTC,"Their first album. It's pretty rad. They were pulling heavy Zep moves. No Peart, they still had Rutsey then. Start at the start :)"
vinyl,3bwp1v,rainofdownvotes,3,Thu Jul 2 22:41:40 2015 UTC,"If you're into super proggy type stuff, I would go with either A Farewell to Kings (my personal favorite) or with Hemispheres. The reason why I say those two records, is because of the Cygnus-X1 songs on both of them. Incredible playing."
vinyl,3bwp1v,maradonuts,3,Thu Jul 2 21:09:29 2015 UTC,I would maybe go with Exit Stage Left. It's a live album (Rush is really great live) and it's got a good mix across a lot of their studio albums.
vinyl,3bwp1v,Rhuey13,3,Thu Jul 2 21:16:57 2015 UTC,"It depends, if you like the more Pink Floyd and King Crimson prog stuff, I'd say 2112 and work from there. I'd personally start at the beginning if I were you just get a sense on their evolution. And don't listen to anything anybody tells you about caress of steel. It's better than any rush album after moving pictures. Fight me."

vinyl,3bwp1v,somelittleboyinblue,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:55:42 2015 UTC,"Might try moving pictures first.  Going to the record store tomorrow so I'll see what they have.

vinyl,3bwp1v,Heliocentrist,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:07:28 2015 UTC,Definitely 'Signals'. It's my personal favorite. Anything released prior is phenomenal as well.

vinyl,3bwp1v,ALotOfArcsAndThemes,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:21:18 2015 UTC,"If I had to pick one to introduce you with I'd say the live album Exit Stage Left. Features excellent song after excellent song, primarily from 77-81 (pretty much their most acclaimed period(s)) but also a number from their earlier work. You'll be missing out on some of their later material which is often, or at least more often than most people say, just as good as their earlier work, but you can do that later."
vinyl,3bwp1v,Keaton223,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:36:41 2015 UTC,"Any Rush album is incredible, but my favorites are early Rush the first 10 albums from 1974's S/T debut up until 1984's Grace Under Pressure. I like the early 80s Rush best when they were experimenting with synths more.   To pick one album is really tough, you can't go wrong with 2112. I would go with Moving Pictures, Farewell to Kings or Signals as a ""first album"".  All of these albums are currently being reissued on vinyl, I know Farewell to Kings is out now and I think Moving Pictures is being reissued in July and Signals in August.   Realistically ANY Rush album is a great start."
vinyl,3bwp1v,Dayinzer,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:06:15 2015 UTC,"I mean, it might sound like the obvious/uneducated answer but I'd say Moving Pictures. To me at least, it's their most listenable album from start to finish- which is how you have to listen to it on vinyl. I'm not saying I don't enjoy their other albums, because I do, I'm a huge Rush fan, and I like certain songs from other albums more than any song on Moving Pictures. But, as a start-to-finish experience I think Moving Pictures is the best."

Your turntable is fine, if set up properly. it's not super high quality, but it should sound good enough.  One of the jobs of the phono is to boost the bass significantly. If you've skipped phono you'll have massive ""meh""  edit: btw your amp is fine too. you don't need a ""vintage"" amp to sound good. That's just ridiculous talk.  if your amp sounds good with your phone then there's obviously nothing wrong with the amp. this subreddit loves to hate Class D amplifiers. 100% uninformed and unsubstantiated"

vinyl,3bx3pl,youshouldreadthem,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:12:12 2015 UTC,you should be using the phono output on your turntable and plugging it into the amplifier with the phono switched on

vinyl,3bx3pl,GothamCountySheriff,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:34:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, exactly that setup. All cables are good, needle is good. And when I switch to line its 5 times louder than phono.

vinyl,3bx3pl,dethrock,2,Fri Jul 3 02:55:17 2015 UTC,"On the LP60 ""Line"" is for connecting to line-level connections, like AUX or CD, and ""Phono"" is for connecting to a phono stage, like those built into a receiver."

Same with Mexican Fenders. In fact one of the guys in my band is running in to the issue right now on his Mexican '70s reissue Strat, he's getting really bad buzzing. No such issues with his (much more expensive) American Strat.

If i can get an original later and it is worth getting sonically (good pressing and mastering) i will but for now represses do just fine. Most of my classic albums are Australian pressings which i think are inferior to European and US pressings so i have them for now to listen to but when i find better pressings i will pick them up as well and get rid of the other one.
vinyl,3bvjvj,p5ych0babble,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:21:31 2015 UTC,I never understood why people would buy a repressing of a classic unless they were extremely rare. I always find it fun to search for that one uncommon record and the excitement that happens from it when i actually do.  There's also the argument of certain classic albums being in analog and some die hard audiophile people might prefer that.  Then again this is just my opinion.

The two separate components were designed to work with and independently of each other. A stand alone pre amp is likely to be better engineered than a phono stage in an integrated amp. You can also mix and match.

vinyl,3bt2hy,wexfun,4,Wed Jul 1 22:34:41 2015 UTC,Nice find. I've been looking for a copy of this for a long time too. Also love to find a copy of Ralf und Florian. Maybe it's just because they get snatched up right away but I never see Kraftwerk records in stores.
vinyl,3bt2hy,redplasticgoat,3,Thu Jul 2 00:33:04 2015 UTC,"Nice, I just found a copy over the weekend too. Back when I first got a turntable and actually started buying records, I only wanted to buy albums from bands that meant a lot to me or that I'd been listening to forever, so I was pretty much almost only looking for Frank Zappa and Kraftwerk albums."
vinyl,3bt2hy,developstopfix,2,Thu Jul 2 01:55:10 2015 UTC,"Nice. I recently found of of these in the wild, as well, after sporting an orig Canadian pressing for a while. I also have an original Kling Klang German pressing of Trans Europa Express."
vinyl,3bt2hy,REMAIN_IN_LIGHT,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:14:21 2015 UTC,"Amazing album that gave way to more fantastic Krautrock bands.  I have been trying to find this everywhere, but couldn't even find a CD copy. I don't know how rare it actually is, I just know it was hard for me to find. Finally I found it today at a used record shop I hadn't been to before in my city.  I love this record and think the B-side is completely perfect. If you like the Berlin trilogy, Neu!, or Can, I recommend giving this album a shot. Or if you just like sort of spacey music.   Now if I can just find Galaxie 500's On Fire..."
vinyl,3bt2hy,PerceptionShift,3,Wed Jul 1 22:56:22 2015 UTC,"Grab the reissue of On Fire. It's like $20 and well done. The original is no better than the reissue. A pretty standard very late 80s pressing. Not worth the extra money. With he cash you save on the reissue you should track down a copy of the Blue Thunder EP which has the excellent cover of Ceremony.   And Autobahn isn't too rare, it was a big hit single in 74/75. It's just popular so they sell fast. Still a great find though, I was happy to finally pick up an original Vertigo press last year. However the other albums excluding Computerworld are quite a bit tougher to find. I've never seen a US copy of The Man Machine in 4-5 years of being aware of Kraftwerk."
vinyl,3bt2hy,PerceptionShift,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:58:41 2015 UTC,"Is the reissue even in print anymore? I've looked a lot for that too. Most online stores seem sold out of it, and I've given up finding it in a record store."
vinyl,3bt2hy,summerisle2,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:33:56 2015 UTC,It's not in print anymore since it came out in 2009 but there's still copies of it around. Although probably not for too much longer.  Plenty on Discogs
vinyl,3bt2hy,snowskifart,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:25:26 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'll probably pick one of those up then. I also just saw that they have some for sale on Damon and Naomi's website.

vinyl,3bt2hy,Snagsby,2,Thu Jul 2 04:02:48 2015 UTC,No it's the American on Vertigo. The German press has a little Autobahn symbol on the top left.
vinyl,3bt2hy,summerisle2,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:48:27 2015 UTC,I think originals are on the  German Phillips label. Not Vertigo.

vinyl,3bt2hy,feelslikeheaven,2,Thu Jul 2 03:40:03 2015 UTC,With the  records they display @ their instgrm they look like a well curated store. I would shop there if I lived in the bay area.

vinyl,3bt2hy,PerceptionShift,2,Thu Jul 2 20:50:14 2015 UTC,ahhh expensive. Figures but I would drop some cash in there if given the chance. Reminds me of Wall Of Sound here in Seattle.
vinyl,3bt2hy,ChrisC914,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:14:41 2015 UTC,Awesome find! I see it (who knows which pressings) fairly often around NYC. Yesterday in fact I saw a copy for $15 but I opted to pick up Computer World for $12 instead and while I was browsing some other dude picked up Autobahn. Kraftwerk stuff definitely goes fast no matter where you are.
vinyl,3bt2hy,Kenethica,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:04:21 2015 UTC,Pretty common in Europe. Funny how sometimes something I want is really rare in Europe and abundant in the US :)
vinyl,3bt2hy,mydogisangry,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:55:57 2015 UTC,"They are really common in Europe no doubt. In one day of shopping I found Computerwelt, Die Menschmachine and Trans Europa Express. Also could have bought Radio Aktivitat and Autobahn but I already have the U.S. versions and they're not any different. I was hoping I'd find the three over the course of my stay here in Germany but nope one day in Hamburg did it. They were cheap too. One of the cashiers asked me why I would buy this old weird record and I told him how they're not that common in he US and have a more ""special"" reputation there. Here they seem to be old hat.   The thing is it's not like they're that rare back home in the US, they just sell fast. Although I have never found The Man Machine in 4 years of looking. That one is oddly rare. And the stuff before Autobahn is rare in both EU and US."

vinyl,3bw9wl,JasonWLand,4,Thu Jul 2 17:53:17 2015 UTC,Easiest for you will be a AT-LP120. You could also go with a Music Hall USB-1. Both are decent tables with built-in preamps and are super simple and easy to set up with your speakers.  The better option is to go vintage like /u/m00dawg said.
vinyl,3bw9wl,maradonuts,2,Thu Jul 2 21:19:00 2015 UTC,The AT-LP120 is exactly what I was looking at actually.
vinyl,3bw9wl,m00dawg,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:53:38 2015 UTC,"If you're on a budget, go vintage. You'll get some great quality with a minimal amount of work (usually just cleaning things up a bit) and can use the money saved for a phono-preamp. That or buy a vintage stereo that has a PHONO connection and you're in business."

Everyone (for the most part) seems to be so nice and helpful. There's always things to learn when it comes to vinyl. I am completely obsessed with everything music and don't have many friends who share the same passion so it's nice to come here and see people talking music all day everyday. I've been a long time lurker of reddit but now that I've found this sub I'm trying to come out of my shell a little bit and learn more about actually posting. I figured this would be a good way to start out here and figured y'all might enjoy some of these. Like the title says, these are some of the more rare records I own and they are my prized possessions. They may not be my favorite albums of all time but they are special to me because they all have a bit of a story. Feel free to ask anything! I'm also interested in hearing what you guys have to say.

vinyl,3buc4j,feelslikeheaven,2,Thu Jul 2 05:35:43 2015 UTC,"Jobriath - self-titled (1973)  I was so excited when I came across this for a decent price ($10), it was also the first time I ever saw it in a record store. Jobriath was this incredibly hyped gay glam rocker who described himself as the first fairy of rock. The album absolutely bombed and it's so sad because he's an amazing piano player and it's a super entertaining album. Recommend it if you like, theater, Elton John, T Rex and classical. ""Be Still"" might be my favorite song on it.  Groove Armada - Vertigo (1999)  I was perusing my local Salvation Army and wasn't finding anything too out of the ordinary until I came across this extremely modern double LP in phenomenal shape. Now I'm not that big of a Groove Armada fan, but I knew it was a great album of theirs after doing some quick research on my phone and knew I found an incredibly solid album. For $2, it's probably the best deal out of any of these 5.  Pockets - Come Go With Us (1977)  The bulk of my record collection is classic 70's and early 80's dance, soul and funk stuff, so since I've found most of the necessary albums, I can now judge whether or not I'l like something based on the cover, record label, and year it was released. This happened to be their first of 3 records and I absolutely love it. Apparently the members were proteges of Earth, Wind, and Fire. Makes sense after about 15 seconds of listening to them.   Tropea - self titled (1975)  John Tropea, a super skilled session guitarist and producer who worked on tons of tons of stuff ranging many genres released a few solo albums of his own and this was the first. He gorgeously blends Jazz and Funk into a groovy dancy super chill album. The first track, ""Tambourine"" is one of my favorites on a stellar album all the way through.   Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes - I Miss You (1972)  An album that helped define the 70s Philly Soul sound, groundbreaking at the time and was a huge hit. The title track is so so epic and the dialogue between Harold Melvin and Teddy Pendergrass is so intense."

As for Audioslave, I think the third is so expensive because not many were issued and there were no reissues like the first 2."
vinyl,3bt6o2,maakuz,6,Thu Jul 2 04:01:42 2015 UTC,"Soundgarden's front man, Chris Cornell took over vocals for Rage Against the Machine to create the supergroup Audioslave.  Tom Morello shines in every song, putting in his trademark screeching wah-wah solos. At the same time he is able to sit back and really allows the rhythm section to take the front seat in a lot of songs. This creates a great dynamic where every instrument can stand out, including Chris Cornell's vocals. While he has mostly known grunge this album proves that he and  everyone else involved is muti-dimensional.  The album is definitely much more mellow than anything Rage or Soundgarden have done, but the way these artists combine is spectacular. I love both bands, but I would pick Audioslave over either most days.  In my opinion this is the best album of the three albums that they composed. It's a shame that they split up after only putting out three albums. Man or Animal and Doesnt Remind are my go to songs on the album.  The blue colored pressing is a nice touch, and each side pictures a different band member."

vinyl,3bs50r,dorktwinkle,3,Wed Jul 1 18:45:33 2015 UTC,Okay cool.  I have an old Luxman that is only about 50 watts per channel myself that sounds great on some decent sized speakers.  It seems to me like as long as you know what you're doing and don't spike your amp (and thus blow something) having good quality is more important than the power
vinyl,3bs50r,leanerpie,2,Wed Jul 1 19:09:27 2015 UTC,"Having good quality is DEFINITELY more important than power. All things being equal (same speakers, same room, same song, same listening position) a 2x increase in wattage corresponds to a 3dB increase in volume which is not very substantial. If you wanted to double the volume you actually need to increase wattage by 10x. In general, the power ratings on an amplifier are better seen logarithmically: 20-50W is good for home listening, 200-500W is good for a dance party or a (loud) home theater setup, 2000-5000W is good for a club or small concert."

vinyl,3bu1iw,thievedrelic,3,Thu Jul 2 05:11:11 2015 UTC,"OP, for setting up the tonearm, you will need to know what cartridge/stylus you have on it so you can correctly set the tracking weight.

I finally picked up that Anthology box set a few months ago myself. Captured Tracks has also been reissuing a lot of great Flying Nun releases over the past few years—including the Clean album ""Vehicle""—that are really worth checking out."
vinyl,3bs2li,chrezvychaino,2,Wed Jul 1 22:40:45 2015 UTC,"Years ago,  I had the Flying Nun cd box set in my hands at Amoeba Records, but ultimately balked at the $99 price tag.  Big regret there,  mostly because it would have been a great way to venture into Kiwi Rock outside of The Clean, The Bats, and The Chills.    Now is as good a time as any to remedy that! Any suggestions?"
vinyl,3bs2li,chrezvychaino,3,Thu Jul 2 11:42:36 2015 UTC,"I definitely second Tall Dwarfs and the Verlaines. Along with the Clean, the Chills, and the Bats, in my mind these bands represent the five pillars of Flying Nun Records/Kiwi Rock.  Tall Dwarfs were pioneers of lo-fi pop, but got pretty bizarre and experimental at times too. Their stuff seems pretty hard to come by on vinyl, and Captured Tracks hasn't yet reissued any of their albums, but I'm hoping that they are forthcoming. Hello Cruel World is definitely a good starting point for them. Chris Knox, the main guy behind Tall Dwarfs, also had a prolific solo career, and was in a couple bands prior to Tall Dwarfs that were more punk-oriented (including Toy Love, which Captured Tracks HAS reissued and is definitely worth checking out as well).  The Verlaines are one of my all-time favorite Kiwi bands. The leader of the band, Graeme Downes, studied music composition and is now a professor of musicology in New Zealand. With the Verlaines he fused classical composition and musical structure with rock and other guitar-driven genres to really unique and amazing effect, particularly with the album ""Hallelujah All The Way Home,"" which Captured Tracks has reissued along with the early singles collection, ""Juvenilia."" Their album ""Bird Dog"" is also fantastic, but has yet to see a vinyl reissue.  I would also highly recommend the Sneaky Feelings' album ""Send You,"" which Captured Tracks reissued a couple months ago. I hadn't given this band much attention until this reissue came out, and it's really blown me away; jangley neo-psych that reminds me a lot of Paisley Underground bands like Rain Parade and the Dream Syndicate.   There are so many other great NZ bands that I would recommend if you can track them down, but I'll just list a few more: Look Blue Go Purple, Snapper, Bailter Space, Alpaca Brothers, Straitjacket Fits, Jean Paul Sartre Experience, the 3Ds, Bird Nest Roys, the Cakekitchen, etc. etc."

He also lives in Orlando, which is relatively close to where I live, so it's even cooler just because he's local. I'm actually one of the members of a closed group he created on Facebook where he asks questions and the fans answer. I think that's why I got the Popular Music album, as I only ordered This World is Scary as Fuck, so maybe he recognized my name or something, I dunno. Either way, the music is incredible.

vinyl,3br5eg,achk,19,Wed Jul 1 14:06:18 2015 UTC,"The wiggling spiral is called an eccentric run out groove.  The earliest records were 78s. They originally had perfectly concentric run outs, but then it was discovered that if you left the heavy reproducer with its steel needle sitting there scraping away too long, you could carve a hole in the record.  So 78s started to have eccentric run out grooves to combat this. But yes, this also tripped the auto return on particularity well-equipped electric phonographs during the 20s.  Much like how album used to refer to a literal album book of records (like a photo album with one record per page), the practice carried over to vinyl. By then it was more trouble than it was worth."
vinyl,3br5eg,UpgradeTech,2,Wed Jul 1 15:53:06 2015 UTC,"Also, the eccentric run-out didn't appear until the 1920s.  Prior to that point, there wasn't really a runout. Also, if you look at my photo I took of this 1910s Columbia, you can see where the record ends, and loops that last revolution infinitely at bottom left - you can see the last bit of the groove merge into the one before it.  At that, being that these were early records, and there was no ""standard"" to speak of, each group kind of did their own thing, just like each record company recorded at their own speed, and to hell with everyone else.  So, if there was a runout, it was different for each record company, until the 1920s."
vinyl,3br5eg,midorikawa,3,Wed Jul 1 17:54:26 2015 UTC,"It still manages to vary quite a bit.   The vertically-cut Edison Diamond Discs do that as well.  I have an early Okeh from 1927 that does manage to make a runout, but it's concentric."

vinyl,3br5eg,4_bit_forever,0,Wed Jul 1 16:01:05 2015 UTC,"The earliest record were aluminum and wax cylinders. You mean the earliest DISC records were 78's, and that's not even entirely true, since the 78 RPM / 10"" standard was not even agreed upon until many years after discs became the dominant format."
vinyl,3br5eg,UpgradeTech,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:15:59 2015 UTC,"True, though the earliest of cylinders used tinfoil sheets apparently.  Cylinders were originally known as ""records"" until Berliner's invention of the flat-disc record came along, necessitating a name change.  And again, the records we now term 78s were simply ""records"" back then. When the long-play vinyl record came along, these old-fashioned records were deemed ""standard play"".  While it is true that early 78s were not often standardized at 78 rpm, it's more convenient to give them that label.  These are just conventional modern terms to better differentiate the formats and some things have blurred over time like Berliner's flat-disc gramophone and Edison's cylinder phonograph; both terms now can refer to a mechanical record-playing device."

vinyl,3br5eg,agentkolter,2,Wed Jul 1 15:59:01 2015 UTC,"You're correct, the eccentric runout groove won't trip (most) auto-return mechanisms.  These tables are looking for an increase in velocity inward from the concentric runout, called a velocity trip mechanism.  Some used different mechanisms, although what they are I couldn't recall off the top of my head.  I've rebuilt a few, and there's generally a reason we standardized on velocity."

vinyl,3bueaq,dftba171,-2,Thu Jul 2 06:12:29 2015 UTC,I did. The name literally seems to be Untitled? Or just Led Zeppelin? There are 7 versions and I have yet to see mine.
vinyl,3bueaq,Ginger-Nerd,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:48:43 2015 UTC,What's the serial number (I think that's what it's called?) on the record? Mine is SD7208.   The record is untitled. It does not have a title. There is no marking whatsoever on the album cover.
vinyl,3bueaq,dftba171,2,Thu Jul 2 07:03:32 2015 UTC,"serial number (I think that's what it's called?)   they are more commonly called catalog numbers, to me a serial number is more commonly individual per item (so say it could be identified if stolen) rather than a number for a whole group of the same item."
vinyl,3bueaq,dftba171,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:05:42 2015 UTC,Its the same. SD7208.
vinyl,3bueaq,dftba171,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:06:13 2015 UTC,I don't know then. Maybe first edition labels were red green orange or something like that. I'm sure someone else's has a copy. Maybe it's common too.

vinyl,3brjym,DeuceSK,2,Thu Jul 2 09:14:15 2015 UTC,"I like to pretend I'm an emerging historian of Canadian punk music of all kinds (at least until the end of the 80s), so it would be impossible to choose a favourite. I've written on that topic here quite a few times.   British Columbia and Alberta also have what are not only amazing industrial scenes, but actually in many cases scenes that served as something like the cradle for many other much more well-known industrial and electronic bands.   Toronto had an incredible psych scene in the 1960s that I'm somewhat familiar with. Of course the east coast of Canada, to this very day, has an incredibly vibrant and interconnected folk scene. The Quebec/Montreal scenes are another thing altogether in terms of experimental music, punk, folk, so-called post-rock, and many other genres.   Winnipeg has a strong rap/hip hop community, as did Vancouver in the 80s and 90s (and I'm sure today?).   Suffice it to say, impossible to choose. But maybe this highlights the under-appreciatedness of Canada's music history by outsiders?"
vinyl,3bqo89,Wizard-in--Black,2,Wed Jul 1 11:01:58 2015 UTC,"For those who haven't heard of them, Toy are a modern psych rock band, taking influence from groups like Can, Neu! and even The Velvet Underground.  I got into them when they had only recently released their debut single and as a result I've been able to pick up their (usually limited edition) releases as they came out.  If anyone is curious as to what they sound like, here's a few of my favourite tracks by them:  Left Myself Behind  Kopter  To A Death Unknown"
vinyl,3bqo89,thecrow1213,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:06:59 2015 UTC,I've been getting into them recently but I had no idea they had this much history! I'll have to put them on my regular playlists and really dive in!
vinyl,3bqo89,AnAwfullyRealGun,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:56:09 2015 UTC,"I definitely recommend it!  They only have two full studio albums but the singles and EPs all have cool B sides, which can be heard on youtube, so it's definitely worth exploring their larger catalogue."
vinyl,3bqo89,AnAwfullyRealGun,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:32:48 2015 UTC,"They came to my town around the time of their debut, and while they weren't bad, I've seen a lot of new bands doing similar stuff much better.  Never really bothered with their recorded stuff but i'm digging these samples , maybe they just had an off-night."
vinyl,3bqo89,AnAwfullyRealGun,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:21:52 2015 UTC,I wouldn't debate that there are other bands doing similar things but personally I think Toy are the best at it.  A lot of the other bands I've heard haven't really grabbed my attention whereas I guess it goes without saying these guys did.  Is there any band in particular that you think are better?
vinyl,3bqo89,AnAwfullyRealGun,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:34:17 2015 UTC,"From the ones I've seen live, Camera, Cult of Dom Keller, Dead Rabbits, Bo Ningen, Goat, Les Big Byrd, Kikagaku Moyo, Hookworms (though I think they're a bit overrated too) all put on better shows."

vinyl,3brgz5,astrovinyl,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:21:04 2015 UTC,Yes. All surfaces in my experience either take very well to the sharpie or it wipes right off. Only seen the former on albums
vinyl,3brgz5,rskipwo,5,Wed Jul 1 17:53:19 2015 UTC,Try to meet them before the show so you can take your signed album back to your car. Leave the vinyl at home so it won't warp in the summer heat.

I've met so many bands I enjoy at the small bar shows. I don't get anything signed because I don't want to haul a vinyl record with me all the way to the venue, usually I get a picture.  If the album cover is black then bring a metallic (silver) colored Sharpie with you to the show.   Have a good time!"

vinyl,3brgz5,undanny1,2,Wed Jul 1 19:13:34 2015 UTC,"Don't risk using gold or silver sharpies. I tried getting the GZA to sign my record one time and my brand new gold sharpie looked awful and faded. It might be a little bit more expensive, but go to an arts and crafts store to get markers if you can."
vinyl,3brgz5,undanny1,2,Wed Jul 1 18:10:41 2015 UTC,"I collect autographed records from when I see my favorite bands in concert. Black sharpie is my go-to, but if it's a dark cover I'll go with one of the metallics. Colored sharpies can look nice too, depending on the art work. Sometimes I'll have the band/artist sign the album insert instead of the cover if it has their picture on it or the album art is too busy and an autograph won't show well.  I like talking to the bands after the show. Not only are they more likely to be ready to talk to fans (since before a show they might be busy setting up), but you also will get the chance to tell them how much you loved their set. At a small club, the band will most likely be at the merch table after their set. If they aren't hanging around the merch, you could also try waiting around the venue's load out exit.   EDIT: oh yeah, and definitely take out the record and any inserts and leave those at home! Also don't be too nervous about carrying around a record cover. It can be a good conversation starter. You can carry it in a square canvas tote bag if you don't want it out in the open."
vinyl,3brgz5,adstretch,2,Fri Jul 3 00:53:10 2015 UTC,Oh canvas bag is smart. I have to take a few modes of transport to get there so i might do that inside a backpack. thanks for all the tips
vinyl,3brgz5,adstretch,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:17:49 2015 UTC,I can't say with 100% certainty that sharpies work on glossy but I think it would as long as you give it a couple of minutes to dry before putting next to anything that might smudge the ink.  I get signatures at loads of gigs and sharpies always work fine for me though I can only comment on the black ones.

She knew that I was into older music and had records so she let me come by and have pick through them. She said an Ebay flipper was going to take a look at them, but that he hadn't showed up, so I got first dibs. It's mostly classic rock stuff that everyone will say they got from their dad, but I'm a big fan of this stuff and somehow haven't been able to find many of these. A few are also ones that my mom had as a kid but got trashed when her mom stored them in a hot garage.

vinyl,3bp0i5,Vebberim,12,Tue Jun 30 23:54:19 2015 UTC,"Not sure if this is a rare score or not, but I got this beauty in the mail today. I won it on eBay, and I was ecstatic to find I was still the highest bidder. It wasn't on discogs when I went looking for it, but it's come to me in NM-/NM condition.  The pressing is light, I'd say maybe a 120-gram on 2xLP. There's nothing special for the bonus 7"" that came with it unfortunately, but that also means the inner gatefold retains its untouched glory. The 7"" contains two extra cuts, Table Scraps and Mercury.  Honestly, this is an amazing album beginning to end, and while it was popular Lazy Eye was the only reason I listened to it in the first place. It's been a go-to album to feel good, pick me up, just make me smile. I don't have it attached to any memories, so every listen is just as pure as the first time. I'm incredibly glad I got this record, and rare or not I wanted to share it with you guys. :)"
vinyl,3bp0i5,VelvetHorse,6,Wed Jul 1 00:00:06 2015 UTC,"I have the same record with the same 7"" that comes with it. I bought it years ago. It's one of my favorites just for that little 7"" inside"

I have this exact album on vinyl, as well as Swoon, Neck of the Wooks and the Singles Collection, because I pretty much can't stop.  I'm listening to all of the albums, all the time, and constantly discover new things i love about them.  My two favourite tracks at the moment would probably be Growing Old Is Getting Old because of the slow, bass driven melody and build up, as well as Make Believe, because at around 3min there is this earth shattering crescendo to the song. For real, it's life affirming. Load it up and turn your headphones way up, and just lay back. I could go on but I really shouldn't.  Fucking cracking band. Super excited for their next release.

I really really liked Neck of the Woods though.  I need to get that on vinyl.  I got it on CD cause I just happen to find it at the music store on its release day, and I didn't even know they were releasing one!!  Busy Bees was one of my most favorite songs on there.  Had all those amazing buildups.  Oh and Simmer.  Definitely looking forward to their next release as well!!  Do you know when its supposed to drop??  Have you ever heard of the band Menomena??  If not I would check them out.  Their ""Friend and Foe"" album is one of my top ten faves.

I like seeing how bands have grown and progressed as artists, and like seeing them try new things.  Bloc Party and TV on the Radio are really good examples.  Every album they put out has its own heart and soul that didn't try to redo what they did before.  I am always excited for what they will come out with next.  Hoped you like Menomena!!"

Multiple people mention the same mismatch of Capital sleeves and Parlaphone stamped records.  I own this pressing and have the exact same situation as you.
vinyl,3br3ey,Taylorvongrela,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:39:19 2015 UTC,"This happened to me too. Capitol on the outside, Parlophone/EMI on the inside. The only difference between this version and the 2008 Parlophone/EMI version is a double stamp on the matrix numbers. This version, after ""NODATA"", goes 01, 01, 04, 01 for sides A-D respectively, which is different from the 2008 version. However, there is a ""2"" that is double stamped over each ""1"" and ""4"" which would make it the same as the 2008 version. I don't know enough about what determines matrix numbers to know what this means. Does anyone else know?"
vinyl,3br3ey,NovocainHurricane,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:21:50 2015 UTC,"What does the dead wax say? I received this album from Amazon today, and it looks to be the same as yours (Capitol on the gatefold, but Parlophone labels on the records), and my dead wax seems to be similar to the Parlophone pressings. It has the handwritten messages (""I Like You, You Are A Wonderful Person"", etc), whereas the Capitol pressings say ""Mastered by Capitol"" with no handwritten messages."
vinyl,3br3ey,SoberIrishGuy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:48:22 2015 UTC,Yup my deadwax has the same thing
vinyl,3br3ey,SoberIrishGuy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:56:25 2015 UTC,"I'm leaning towards these being the Parlophone pressings. I could maybe believe that the labels were mixed up at some point, but that wouldn't explain the dead wax. Reading through the comments on Discogs, there are multiple complaints concerning the sound of the Capitol pressing. Everything from lifeless and muffled sound to poor channel separation. Obviously this is all subjective, but I think my copy sounds great. Distorted parts are fat and meaty, the high end has a nice sizzle, and nothing sounds buried or muffled."
vinyl,3br3ey,Starsmustshoot,0,Thu Jul 2 02:09:26 2015 UTC,"That is odd, not heard of this before.  You'll know if it is the Parlophone release though if it sounds more grungy.  When I compared both pressing I found that the 1990s pressings (Parlophone, doesn't matter 1st, 2nd press whatever) were mastered to the more grunge influenced sound of the time, the guitars growl more etc, where as the capitol pressing sounds more clean as if mastered to Radiohead's electronic image."
vinyl,3br3ey,Starsmustshoot,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:58:16 2015 UTC,Would the modern Parlophone repress sound the exact same as the old Parlophone pressing?
vinyl,3br3ey,Starsmustshoot,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:01:03 2015 UTC,"That I don't know.  I just had both the 1st and 2nd presses from the 90s, and the capitol also at one point, don't ask why. So I have only been able to compare those.  Personally, I find songs like Paranoid Android better on the Parlophone pressings, but songs like No surprises possibly better on capitol if I remember correctly, so picking which you'd prefer is more of a preference thing I think.  I went through my later teens in the 90s though so I lean slightly more to the grunge sound personally."
vinyl,3br3ey,Starsmustshoot,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:06:06 2015 UTC,I'm thinking these are Capitol records. I have had the CD for a while and it sounds almost exactly like the CD. Very clear and crisp.
vinyl,3br3ey,Starsmustshoot,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:18:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'd say so then. It is definitely noticeable when guitar kicks in on Paranoid android on the Parlophone I find, just has more distorted fuzz for want of a better term.  You'd notice.  What my guess is that both Parlophone and Capitol use the same pressing plant and whoever was the operator at the time got mixed up and got the labels out of the wrong box, or something like that."

Some reissues, like Dirt from Alice in Chains, have a better dynamic range. But I prefer the OG because it sounds like the way it sounded in the 90s (on tape or whatever).   Anyway, haven't heard the Capitol release from OK Computer, only the 2nd 90s press. So can't comment on that"

Yet, when you make a commitment to a life project, this is what you do. You listen to a damn record because you've committed to listening to the best damn records of all time.  (And yes, I'm fully aware I just referred to myself in the second person.)  I know nothing about Art Brut apart from their hit song ""Formed a Band"". Upon initial listen, I thought it was clever and meta -- perhaps for its own good.  Anyway, a lot of people consider Bang Bang Rock & Roll to be one of the greatest records of the '00s. I don't know whether it is. But whatever the case, I'll be giving you my review next week."

vinyl,3broh0,xinthislifex,9,Wed Jul 1 16:32:37 2015 UTC,"I don't really think collecting has much to do with it. Those that collect records have an inherent love of music, for the most part, and are always looking to expose themselves to new music. Before I started collecting records I would still search for new music. That being said constantly going into a store that specializes in music has exposed me to music I may not have otherwise heard. I don't think collecting has anything to do with music taste, as much as collecting has to do with those that love music. Even in this sub you can see people who stick to the same genres, and that is perfectly fine."
vinyl,3broh0,PantsAreForPosers,5,Wed Jul 1 17:30:02 2015 UTC,"Honestly this may sound lame, but a crazy cheap sale on a newer record or finding a nice condition classic while digging through cheap used records will bring it into my collection. ""Eh, $2? I'll give it a spin."" I've discovered a few bands/albums that I love that way, so in essence, collecting has definitely given me a broader taste in music that I wouldn't have listened to otherwise."
vinyl,3broh0,ComicallySolemn,2,Wed Jul 1 17:27:32 2015 UTC,"Fuck yes. I've found so many cool records because they were cheap enough to take a chance on. The ones I don't dig can be passed on to someone else.  I, too, enjoy a bargain on a new record. It even made me darken the door of a Hot Topic where I grabbed Ace of Spades for $9.99 when we visited the states. (my kids wanted to go in there anyway to buy anime merch:)"
vinyl,3broh0,DeuceSK,2,Wed Jul 1 17:31:58 2015 UTC,There is good folk to be found for cheap.
vinyl,3broh0,rufiooooooooooo,12,Wed Jul 1 18:03:02 2015 UTC,"The older I get the more my musical tastes expand. At 42 I own and listen to a much more diverse selection of records than 20 years ago.   In my teens and early 20s I only listened to underground hardcore punk and metal.   Now I love psych, blues, country, reggae/dub, early electronic, folk, free jazz...so much stuff I had no stomach for as a youngster. I still have a disdain for many mainstream bands but I just listen to what I like."
vinyl,3broh0,DeuceSK,5,Wed Jul 1 17:02:36 2015 UTC,"As for my own anecdotal experience, almost immediately after I started collecting I began expanding my horizons. I don't really like to think of it as broadening my taste, because I feel like I probably would have always liked the music I'm researching now. It was just absent in my life. I had never heard shoegaze ambient style music before, but I always enjoyed those kinds of sounds. Conversely, I don't like country and probably never will, regardless of how hard I try to appreciate it, or how much I research."
vinyl,3broh0,Piratica,4,Wed Jul 1 17:44:32 2015 UTC,"While I do think that collecting records and 'broadening one's horizon' are correlated, I wouldn't argue that the relation is causal. I think both are influenced by the same factor: interest in music."
vinyl,3broh0,HardcoreHerbivore,5,Wed Jul 1 19:28:04 2015 UTC,I absolutely agree that collecting expands your personal taste in music. Collecting only one or two genres at a time eventually gets boring IMO. I'll move around from one to the next every month or so to keep myself interested in digging and finding things I didn't know about or previously wasn't interested in.
vinyl,3broh0,dem01,6,Wed Jul 1 16:40:40 2015 UTC,I think digging in the field for any physical medium of music forces you to expose yourself to different styles of music so you can make pruchasing decisions when looking for music already inside your comfort zone.
vinyl,3broh0,employee6817,3,Wed Jul 1 18:08:07 2015 UTC,Collecting records doesn't necessarily equate to broader taste. I have always been pretty broad in my taste and started collecting vinyl just 2 years ago.
vinyl,3broh0,unrelentingdepth,3,Wed Jul 1 17:52:18 2015 UTC,correlated but not necessarily cause and effect
vinyl,3broh0,cabasse,2,Wed Jul 1 20:47:17 2015 UTC,"I agree my tastes have expanded. A few months ago a friend asked me what I wanted for my birthday, and I told her to get me a record or two. When she asked which bands I liked, I said it didn't matter. And it doesn't. I'll listen to just about anything now.  But I'm not sure my changing preferences in music is directly related to collecting. Instead, as a result of being a collector I have significantly upgraded my sound system, which makes everything sound better. I hear nuance and range in music that I never heard before, which gives me a greater appreciation for all styles and genres.  Edit: On the flip side, now some of the albums I always loved sound like crap. Appetite for Destruction is a good example. I don't know if that's in the way the album was mixed, but now it sounds flat and muddy. Compared to a lot of my other records it sounds like it's playing through an AM radio."
vinyl,3broh0,headzoo,2,Wed Jul 1 17:23:16 2015 UTC,"It might seem backwards, but having a limited supply of music seems to broaden my horizons more than the endless music on Spotify. When any music is readily available, I tend to listen to the same stuff over and over. But when I'm at the record store and see a record with an interesting album cover (and a good price) I'm inclined to buy it. Did I know what Tangerine Dream was before I bought two of their albums yesterday? No, but I'm glad I did."
vinyl,3broh0,Jamessonia,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:26:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think that being a collector means you have a broader taste in music because I think of it the other way around.    I think that because you have such a deep passion for music, you would start to collect and purchase your music in vinyl because of the many qualities vinyl has.  These qualities are the ones that make it so appealing to a true music lover.  Broader taste is due to that passion for music, and collecting vinyl is just something else that displays that passion."
vinyl,3broh0,staringatascreen,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:40:34 2015 UTC,I know the older I get the more my mind opens up to new/old music. I'm 37 now and 5 years ago I wouldn't have been caught dead with a grateful dead LP. I'm also loving Pedro Garcia and his Del Prado orchestra. I think reading and watching documentaries on certain genres helps a lot to.
vinyl,3broh0,BeerandVinyl,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:26:00 2015 UTC,"For me, record collecting has expanded my horizons. I rarely buy music I already own digitally; I prefer to buy music I've never heard before. When I'm at a record store organized by genres, I prefer to spend time in genres other than rock and pop. Nothing against them, it's just they already compromise a majority of my collection. Also, compilation albums are a good way to check out unheard of artists."

vinyl,3btc4q,thehoods,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:59:11 2015 UTC,"Usually when I search for turntables I just search ""turntable.""  Here's what pops up when you do that: http://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/sby/sss?sort=rel&query=turntable  So it looks like you've got some choices to work with.  I'd personally go with this: http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sby/for/5087766373.html. I like technics because they are pretty reliable and a good table to move to after the LP60 (I use an MCS which is like a technics clone using the same parts).  I also used an LP60 previously.  I'd go with this one because I believe belts and knobs for SL-B2s are pretty easy to find on ebay I believe, so $20 for the table, maybe $18-$20 for the knob and belt (found on ebay), and $20 for a headshell (found on amazon or ebay) leaves you around $60 in leaving only a cartridge to be bought.  From there you could spend whatever you feel comfortable with for the cart and enjoy.  This would be good for someone moving from an LP60 because you will learn about all about the parts of a turntable and be comfortable enough with it when you are done to replace belts, headshells, carts, or knobs if they need to be replaced."

Your craigslist looks like you have quite a few good options so if you really want a dustcover than you won't have a problem in that respect.  Another thing someone moving from an LP60 needs to know: you will need to buy a phono preamp if your receiver has no phono input for most all vintage tables, so keep that in mind."
vinyl,3btc4q,LaserRanger,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:55:17 2015 UTC,"You know, those Shure V15 carts are not exactly easy to find - so for me the JVC table is maybe the most interesting and uncommon combo in that list.

The pioneer has custom military grade RCA amplifier chips that the pervious owner must have installed. And r/audiorepair advised me fit a heat sink to it. When I started, I couldn't even figure out how to hookup speakers wires to the weird looking outs."

vinyl,3bpnpz,leanerpie,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:29:08 2015 UTC,"Dual has actually been around since the late 20s and started out with early electric phonographs.

The only thing I could find to base a price on was a promo copy of 'Jazz: Red Hot  And Cool' that sold in 2005 for $160.50.

Get over yourselves you sound like children.

The spindle is slightly larger than the hole in the record so I widened it a little bit with a knife. I like to use coloured vinyl as it looks prettier, but obviously any type or size of record will work. This is a 5"" record which I think is the best size to match the size of the hands."

vinyl,3bpkvy,breatherevenge,6,Wed Jul 1 18:48:59 2015 UTC,"No one posted Rush yet? What gives?!  My picks would have to be Rush's self titled album Rush (1974) and of course 2112 (1976). Both of mine are original pressings though I understand the latest represses are really well done and sound great. I just got to see Rush on their R40 tour, they were spectacular live! If you get the chance to go, don't hesitate."

Don't be in a hurry, you'll make bad decisions. Be friendly. Make reasonable offers. Check the condition before you buy. Have fun!  If you show up late the selection will be drastically reduced but you will be able to haggle more. The dealers don't want to take everything back with them."

I recently read a long thread about the ""magic eraser"" method on audiokarma and have started using that. It's extremely effective. You just take a small square of the melamine sponge (Mr. Clean brand is best known, but it's dirt cheap and just as good to get generic stuff). And lower your stylus onto it three times or so."
vinyl,3bqdon,blerg34,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:26:02 2015 UTC,Thanks so much! I will be buying one of those soon.
vinyl,3bqdon,ferretsRfantastic,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:56:27 2015 UTC,I probably wouldn't use them. I feel like a dry sheet would be too rough and even a wet one wouldn't clean within the grooves very well if at all. Great for cleaning lenses though.
vinyl,3bqdon,developstopfix,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:36:48 2015 UTC,"Just water won't do much good. Because of the surface tension of water, it won't penetrate inside the grooves. You need a chemical to break that surface tension in order to get in there and clean up. I use a mix of purified water, a mild Dawn dish soap, and Jet Dri. There's plenty of recipes out there. We've been using it for 3 years and have had no problems with it. I've been through over 3000 records on one gallon and we still have about a quart left.  Bite the bullet and get a good felt brush. It's not expensive. If you just look for the easiest way to clean, you'll likely damage either the record or the needle over time. It's not worth the risk."
vinyl,3bqdon,VinylJunkieM,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:45:33 2015 UTC,For the surface tension a photographic wetting agent like Ilfotol or PhotoFlo works too. You only need a few ml.

vinyl,3bpjjj,dethrock,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:08:09 2015 UTC,"I sent many an email when canceling a preorder through them. Any requests for a refund were not responded to. I even tried to get the BBB involved and it only ended with ""we reached out to the company and never heard back"". I didn't even think that was possible. I'll never order through them again."
vinyl,3bpjjj,Zodsayskneel,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:32:07 2015 UTC,The BBB is not an enforcement agency.  They lack authority to do anything other than rate you poorly.  Responses are voluntary.

vinyl,3bpjjj,Zodsayskneel,4,Wed Jul 1 21:41:03 2015 UTC,"Those ""really cool reissues"" SRC offers are just CD masters that are not approved by the artists. Honestly, if you had access to a press you could practically churn out the same level of quality they do. Don't waste your money buying CDs on vinyl from them. Tell your friends too."
vinyl,3bpjjj,Zodsayskneel,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:36:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's sort of what I've been finding out. I heard an interview with Virgil who ran the Vinyl Collective, and the way he made it sound was that they were always in contact with bands who were not interested in re-releasing the material themselves. Maybe that changed when it became SRC, or maybe it was all horseshit."
vinyl,3bpjjj,punkbandit,3,Wed Jul 1 15:31:02 2015 UTC,Nothing new from SRC.
vinyl,3bpjjj,aj5dv,3,Wed Jul 1 13:59:54 2015 UTC,"Okay so here is how it goes with them. First off sorry for having to deal with SRC, they are the WORST. Basically they are a 2 man shop that sucks at customer service like easily the worst service i've ever seen. They never deliver orders on time, this is a constant pattern. My theory is that they put up pre-orders way way ahead of time so a lot of people pre-order then something always goes wrong and they keep pushing back dates and always have excuses. So they have all this money tied up for a product they don't deliver.  Now they say since they cancel the pre-order that they will give you a full refund. In my case and in many others, Danny will e-mail you and say you should of gotten a link to follow to get your refund. If you don't receive this link, which I never did, they will tell you there's absolutely nothing they can do. So you are basically screwed, they took your money and didn't deliver you a record.  Call your credit card company immediately, and tell them what happened and usually they will reverse the charge. However that is if you used a credit card, if you use a debit card to order like I did and they had my money tied up for 9 months, it gets difficult to get those charges reversed. I put together a like 6 page document that I had to fax, yes fax to my bank. It took me about an hour or two to get it all together, and was a huge pain the ass. I finally got my money back and some semblance of justice but when I think about it, it still makes my blood boil. So I suggest calling your credit card company and never order from these idiots again. They are the worst.    Even if you go to their facebook page it's just comment upon comment of people asking where their records are.  That's an immediate red flag.   EDIT: can we like attach something to the sidebar to tell people about this company? I feel like SRC hate threads pop up every week."
vinyl,3bpjjj,zombiedonkey,2,Wed Jul 1 19:06:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is pretty common. I myself am waiting on an order that I placed a few weeks ago and everything was said to be in stock. Three weeks later and nothing. It's frustrating because the only thing you can do is stop supporting them."
vinyl,3bpjjj,datraceman,2,Wed Jul 1 05:00:44 2015 UTC,"SRC is a pain in the ass as everything I've ever ordered there comes in about 3 weeks after it ""shipped"". I ordered an in-stock record once and the ""label printed"" the next day. 6 weeks later I got my order.   Same for the recent Lit reissue. It ""shipped"" then about a month later I got my record.   I truly think they have the shittiest shipping policies on the planet or a bunch of lazy buffoons working there. They print shipping labels then wait about 2 weeks before realizing they need to actually pack and schedule a pickup with the USPS."

vinyl,3bpjjj,fght,0,Wed Jul 1 14:56:28 2015 UTC,"I simply stopped ordering from them. Several small issues, but when I ordered the Jimmy eat world preorders is when I snapped. Might seem stupid, but I ordered all three of the represses which were suppose to have the same release date. Then they bumped two of them up a whole month, normally getting a pre order early would be great. However, they didn't send the first two until the third one started shipping. This was a whole month later, and I was in contact with them the whole time. I would have just grabbed them from my local store."

But if people start writing ""people is..."" or ""mine and you're dog"", it may become accepted, but those people will still sound fucking dumb to others."
vinyl,3bn7v1,oricthedamned,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:29:51 2015 UTC,"Your first example is common in Appalachian English. A lot of Americans have a kneejerk reaction to both that dialect and AAVE as ""uneducated"" or ""dumb"", but that is simply not true. Dialectal variation is just as valid as Standard American English.  The second isn't incorrect grammar as much as a misspelling (which are often conflated). In speaking (and the linguist is primarily concerned with spoken language), it would sound exactly the same."

I've never had a mailman do this, though sellers almost never put a warning on the box. Still, it should be common practice. The type of flat, bendy mailer they used probably didn't help deter this. They might not have tried with a box-type mailer."

vinyl,3bn7v1,flockavellli,8,Tue Jun 30 16:20:37 2015 UTC,"that thing looks pretty thrashed - was this a brand new LP? if so, you're better off filing a claim and having the seller send you a replacement."
vinyl,3bn7v1,Ginger-Nerd,4,Tue Jun 30 16:35:14 2015 UTC,"I bought if off of Amazon and I contacted the seller. The record is still in the plastic wrap stuff, so it is brand new."
vinyl,3bn7v1,flockavellli,11,Tue Jun 30 18:19:18 2015 UTC,"ah, yeah. in that case, just give up on trying to correct the epic warp that will never get it back to the brand new shape that you paid for and tell the sender to properly/securely package their LPs next time.."
vinyl,3bn7v1,Ginger-Nerd,3,Tue Jun 30 18:22:15 2015 UTC,"to me this isn't really the senders fault - I know (at least where i live) you can lodge complaints against the postal service, if they damaged your package - that is who i would be going for.   looking at the picture, one would expect that packaging to be sufficient (I have shipped many records with similar packaging and never had a problem)"
vinyl,3bn7v1,flockavellli,8,Tue Jun 30 18:28:13 2015 UTC,"I disagree, that looks like a glorified padded envelope. Not acceptable. LPs are properly shipped using LP sized mailers and inserted cardboard stiffeners for reinforcement. The sender failed to package this securely - you can't bend an LP mailer to fit into a mailbox. Therefore, the seller is at fault. Don't sell records online if you're not going to package them safely. As to your suggestions regarding lodging a complaint against the USPS - that is the a problem for the seller, not the buyer."
vinyl,3bn7v1,greenbrooms,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:16:00 2015 UTC,"I believe it is a proper record mailer - but they do sort of have a bag like design. regardless it should be sufficient to mail a record in (assuming its properly secured)   that said - I could bend a properly packed record, with little ease (especially when the cardboard has weak points) and fit it into a mailbox that size. (i think you are massively overestimating how strong a standard mailer is) the way it appears to be packed, doesn't look that out of the ordinary, and should be fine 99% of the time - as long as the postman doesn't fuck it up by forcing it into the box.  My point is - you could slap an address on a bare album cover (no protection) and it should reach your place without being fucked up (assuming no fuck ups on the part of the mail service) which is what has happened here - when i mail something, i expect the contents to be in the same condition as they left my place in. which is why i said it was a postal issue.    as i said where i live (ie not in the usa - UPS doesn't run here) our system is different. I believe after the postal service takes the item, the seller has nothing else to do with it, and any problems from that point on wards (with the delivery of the item, is up to the buyer to lodge the complaint. (however, almost every record bar like 7"") are couriered by default - which means its hand delivered to the doorstep - so things like this happen fairly rarely."

Online it's intended to be consumed as quickly and easily as possible, whereas a dictionary you'll not just get one definition, but multiple and probably learn a few more words you didn't know you wanted to learn.

It's pretty surprising too because I order a lot of records online and the mail lady has to walk up my stairs to drop it off, i'm sure she hates delivering stuff to my house.   All that said, I doubt putting fragile or do not bend will have any effect. Mail carriers aren't looking at each parcel of mail they deliver and seeing what to be careful with.

Another personal favourite of mine is this album from Hector Costita: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmtNJdoF7PI  Brazilian music is the best!!   edit: just a few other outstanding albums to get on vinyl: - A Música De Edu Lobo Por Edu Lobo: http://www.discogs.com/Edu-L%C3%B4bo-Edu-L%C3%B4bo-Par-Edu-L%C3%B4bo-Avec-Le-Tamba-Trio/release/3416329 - Elis Regina in London: http://www.discogs.com/Elis-Regina-Elis-Regina-In-London/master/192629 - Tamba Trio - Tempo: http://www.discogs.com/Tamba-Trio-Tempo/master/459826 - Baden Powell - À Vontade: http://www.discogs.com/Baden-Powell-%C3%80-Vontade/master/420482 - Gilberto Gil - Louvação: http://www.discogs.com/Gilberto-Gil-Louva%C3%A7%C3%A3o/release/4794480 - and of course anything by Vinicius de Moraes, who composed many of the absolute classics of Bossa Nova.

vinyl,3bmhiw,GreGoMo,3,Tue Jun 30 21:09:44 2015 UTC,Milton Nascimiento's Clube Da Esquina record is absolutely great on a summer afternoon.
vinyl,3bmhiw,Indy_M,2,Wed Jul 1 02:53:58 2015 UTC,came here to say this. fucking beautiful record and the best music to sample too!
vinyl,3bmhiw,cwfutureboy,3,Wed Jul 1 04:21:22 2015 UTC,"So the starting place with a lot of Bossa Nova is Antonio Carlos Jobim who basically penned the bossa nova songbook, especially on ""The Composer of Desafinado Plays"" which is where a lot of tracks like ""Girl From Ipanema"" and ""One Note Samba"" came from. His is usually a name to look out for and his stuff shows up cheaply and often.   Getz/ Gilberto of course and as mentioned. But also a fantastic album Getz did with Charlie Byrd called ""Jazz Samba"". Both of these can be had cheaply.   Gal Costa is really cool. I like her 1969 self-titled release a lot. It does a lot of interesting sonic and rhythmic things and it can get pretty psychedelic. Also her '67 album with Caetano Veloso.   Another good one is Jorge Ben. His fist album and A Tábua De Esmeralda are great. I also like Africa Brasil but it's more of a funk/ samba fusion album. Apparently he's a really good lyricist, but I don't speak Portuguese.   Unfortunately with Costa and Jorge Ben their albums are out of print/ only printed in Brazil and 4 Men With Beards has handled some of the represses...Which are notoriously terrible.   One wild card album is one I found from a guy who collected a bunch of Brazilian records and was selling them at like $2 each. There was a soundtrack: ""Carinhoso - Trilha Sonora Original Da Novela"" that he sold me, which is a bunch of Latin jazz, bossa nova, funk, and some weird cheesy synth stuff. Really cool. It goes for a bit on Discogs, but keep your eye out for it in case it pops up in a dollar bin somewhere.   My computer's busted and I'm on mobile otherwise I'd post some likes. Let me know if I missed anything/ you have any questions."

vinyl,3bmhiw,CarlCarlsonRnR,2,Tue Jun 30 12:55:21 2015 UTC,"I'm going to go with an obscure reference and recommend you check out Baden Powell. He is a very talented Brazilian guitarist that plays a lot of bossa nova style music. He has released a ton of albums if you check out his discogs page. I only have one of his albums and I can't remember at the moment which one (I bought it back in 2003 and haven't listened to it in years, which means it's time for me to go digging and pull it out for a listen!).  I discovered him via a band called Smokey & Miho. They are Smokey Hormel, who has played guitar for Beck, and Miho Hatori from the band Cibo Matto. They released two EP's in 2002 and covered a couple Baden Powell songs. I highly recommend you check them out as well, but their EP's were only released on CD."

First side is just Baden Powell playing solo on acoustic guitar. It has more of a mellow jazzy feel to it, but his guitar skills are excellent. The last song on side A has a full band and picks up the tempo into bossa nova. Side B continues with the full band and singing. Full funky bossa nova Brazilian fun tunes.  I bought this album off of eBay in 2002/2003 for around 12 or 15 bucks, it's going for a little more on discogs now. At the time, it was the only album I could find for sale on ebay when I was searching for something from him. Now if you search eBay you can find quite a bit from him for sale.  Thanks for making this post and making me go back into my collection for an album I haven't listened to in years! This is part of the the fun of record collecting!"

The purpose of the dustcover is to keep dust off the playing components and playing area between plays, not during. The dustcover itself becomes a resonant echo chamber if you leave it down during playback.  My current deck does not have a dust cover on it. Since I live in a low dust area, the only use I have for a dustcover is to keep tiny hands and wondering animals away from the turntable. Since I rarely have either at my house, I'm pretty safe."

If you buy a TT in my opinion you are better buying new or on craigslist and definitely not ebay. A lot of ebay electronics sellers find stuff all over their area maybe give it some basic work and flip it. 9 out of 10 times when it gets to your house whether its because the seller was dishonest or shipping isn't handled carefully something is broken especially with TT's because there's a lot of moving parts.

I find 99% of the posts ""is this TT good?"" a bit redundant, chances are this specific question has been asked on audiokarma.org's forums in the past 5 years. I know for myself that when I was purchasing my first used TT, this is exactly where I found all of the information.

Over the years the amount of near identical posts increased a lot because less and less individuals take the time to actually google and research a problem/topic. It feels like they just want to be spoon fed. Which is pretty sad considering that you should put your own time in something that's important/a hobby to you. And it's funny since most of the time these people, who were too lazy to research something for at least a few minutes (I mean, come on, google is not that hard to use) are the ones who'll whine the loudest because they get treated like the lazy, whiny kids they are. Which - according to them - is totally not true and so unfair. Yea, sure.  That being said, I totally agree with you. I've spent hours across various forums researching about my SL-1600 MK2 to learn all the ins and outs and to actually know what's going on in there and which screw holds what and what moves what.

vinyl,3bleyz,rusy,7,Tue Jun 30 12:30:05 2015 UTC,"""vinyl is a complicated medium for listening to music, so learning everything involved should, in turn, also be complicated.""  I have to disagree with you 100%.  If this is complicated to you, you're in the wrong hobby.  Listening to vinyl is about enjoyment.  Not about scrutinizing every aspect to the point of insanity.  Buy a record player, hook it up, listen to records.  It's really that simple.   A post like this is why everyone hates people who ""listen to vinyl"".  Its like the crossfit of music for gods sake.  Why come on here and give some overly romantic, and contradictory, story about how you stumbled across your dads old stash?    It really baffles my mind how people become such elitist pricks because they figured out how to hook up some speakers and drop a needle on one of the oldest playback mediums known to mankind. I'm pretty sure this isn't what Edison had in mind."
vinyl,3bleyz,senor_prickneck,6,Tue Jun 30 14:52:07 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  I was going to say the same thing but as an admitted newb, didn't want to go there.  I wanted to start listening to vinyl.  Not collect, just listen.  I had no idea what to do so I just bought an Audio Tecnhica from my local record shop.  Plugged it into an ancient receiver/satellite speakers.  It's clunky.  It looks like shit.  But my setup was definitely easier than even downloading torrents.  Some of my records have ripped sleeves, and some are pop albums I bought brand new.  I don't give a shit about the nitty-gritty details, I just wanna listen to my tunes."
vinyl,3bleyz,senor_prickneck,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:16:00 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry you interpreted it that way, and I certainly didn't intend to come off as an ""elitist prick."" You have to understand- most of my music listening up until two years ago was digital. Going from the click of a button, to turntable into a preamp into an amplifier into speakers (not to mention cartridges, needles, counterweights, etc) was something I had to learn about. Just because it's one of the oldest playback mediums known to mankind, doesn't mean it's a simple playback medium. At least not for all of us. So, I wrote some ""overly romantic, and contradictory, story"" about how I stumbled across my dad's old gear because that's how I got into understanding the hobby of listening to albums on vinyl, and this is the vinyl sub. The moral of my story is that it's satisfying and worthwhile to learn about what you're doing, rather than to get the quick answer."
vinyl,3bleyz,narwolking,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:22:03 2015 UTC,"Maybe I misinterpreted but I think you're over complicating things.  There is a way a turntable needs to be hooked up, yes. But there is a way digital needs to be hooked up as well. Many people, unless you're under the age of 35, would consider it more difficult to logon to the Internet, get an iTunes account, but credits, search for music, download it, connect the playback devise to a receiver and finally listen to the music.  That's the beauty of records. Simplicity. If your cartridge goes bad, replace it. If the belt breaks, replace it. It's not rocket since and when you try to make it seem as such, that's when you seem like an elitist. Again, it's just vinyl. Enjoy it."
vinyl,3bleyz,sohcea,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:38:31 2015 UTC,"Under 35?  Many of us older folk know our way around a computer.  Especially since it wasn't so easy to use one back in the day.  I'm 42 and my school got an Apple ][+ in 1979.  We were taught to program on it.  Since, I've used pretty much every OS to come out.  (I liked OS/2 quite a bit and keep an old NeXT Cube alive because I love it.)  I started running Linux in 2001 and can run it from the command line.  So let's just say that logging onto the Internet and going to iTunes isn't so difficult.  In fact, we have my 72 year-old mother doing it.  And, believe it or not, when mom first wanted a computer when she was 65, my brother-in-law and I put her on a Linux box.  Which she had no trouble using.  She uses an iMac today.  Anyhow, I think vinyl is more complicated than a modern format should be.  Vinyl is mechanical reproduction and it's difficult to get everything working together correctly.  It loses resolution the closer you get to the center of the record and the bass tends to bleed together in both channels.  Dynamic range is poor, too.  This is why I've disassembled my Michell Orbe and SME IV setup, soon to be seen on Audiogon.  I greatly prefer my music server.  Over 3,000 albums ripped to lossless and my iPad is the world's best remote control.  I have a Nelson Pass D1 clone feeding that to the rest of my system.  No more cleaning, no more storage, no more flipping.  I just get to enjoy the music."

vinyl,3bnm0e,BHMaloney,9,Tue Jun 30 17:42:05 2015 UTC,"I got into vinyl because I got really into Soul, old soul and RnB, not funk soul. Really great access to soul music here in Portland through radio, local djs, and places like Mississippi records. Anyway, a lot of that stuff was never rereleased after the vinyl age, so you're only option is LPs and 45s.   So as I fell in love with digging through records for hours I would inevitably see Beatles albums all the time. I'm 29 and I grew up knowing the Beatles were a big deal, I'd heard random songs here and there. But, I'd never sat down and just listened to a Beatles record start to finish. So, one day I found Abbey road for $5. I took it home put it on and enjoyed some fancy beers. Now I'm a believer. That opened the flood gates for early rock n  roll for me. Eventually bought all the Beatles, rolling stones, kinks, etc I could find."
vinyl,3bnm0e,OregonFreeman,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:27:46 2015 UTC,"Its funny, it normally goes the other way around. The people I've met usually start with old rock, discover its blues roots and then follow it the rabbit hole to funk, jazz, soul and R&B."
vinyl,3bnm0e,submarinefacemelt,4,Wed Jul 1 05:42:34 2015 UTC,"I got into records when I was into punk and hardcore in my early teens. Lots of vinyl releases in those scenes. From there I got into early 90s emo/post hardcore stuff, then made a (really not so far) jump to noise and the like at about 17. Started getting into jazz/free jazz around the same time. Listened to 90% noise and free form stuff for a few years, then got kind of bored with it and made a complete 180, listening to only old country blues and folk music for a couple years. Then I heard Can and got into all the krautrock bands which eventually led me to get back into free jazz and all kinds of avant music. Now I'm all over the map but I have a special love for contemporary classical, early electronic, musique concrete, krautrock, jazz and EAI. I think being into records has played a pretty significant part in my interest in older stuff (50s-80s) in those areas of music."
vinyl,3bnm0e,redplasticgoat,3,Tue Jun 30 19:50:57 2015 UTC,"My record collection and the additions I've made over the years has been a dependent reflection of my music taste. I don't buy a record unless I already know the artist or have a very strong reason to believe that I'll like the artist/record (e.g., I love John Lee Hooker so I buy a Son House record without having previously heard it, but the Son House record I buy is going to be ""safe"" in that it'll be critically-acclaimed or widely popular).  For exploring other genres, artists, or albums, I use Spotify or YouTube. If I come across something I'm really into, I'll throw it into my Discogs Wantlist and possibly pick it up along the way if the price is right."
vinyl,3bnm0e,iliketunamelts,3,Tue Jun 30 18:34:15 2015 UTC,"As a college student who's only been collecting for ~4 months I don't have the money or the insight to buy records that I think I might possibly perhaps like. I have a list of hip-hop, soul, and funk records/artists that I know I like and want and once I get those then I can experiment with related genres/artists.   But if I see something interesting outside of that though I'll go home and check it out on discogs/youtube to see what it's about which has lead me to discovering a lot of jazz/jazz-fusion, library records, and japanese music that, even as little as 8 months ago, I thought I would never listen to. There's alot of music out there and I'm a little mad I've been so narrow-minded with my tastes up until now."

After spending all my teens listening to hip hop, I started getting into funk, soul and jazz in early colllege. Then I discovered disco and boogie which I binged on quite extensively. From I DJed for a while and got into to old school house and then UK garage and some other bass genres (although I don't have too many of those records).   Now over the last 3 years, I revisited the weirder side of disco, as well as new wave, Balearic, ambient, psych, kraut, jazz fusion, space music, library music and oddities.     Edit: And the whole time I had a guilty pleasure interest in yacht rock, smooth grooves, 80s synth pop and assorted AOR.      I'm not sure whats next!"

Now that I'm an adult I can tell people and not give a fuck (""Barbie Girl"" still goes hard), but when I was 15 I prayed that my friends wouldn't find out lest I be ostracized to the shitty table at lunch like a red-headed, blind leper with severe eyebrow lice."
vinyl,3bnm0e,A_Wee_bitOfVinegar,2,Wed Jul 1 18:27:26 2015 UTC,"In the late 90's in highschool I listened to classic rock, alt rock, and hip hop.  In early 00's in college I listened to Phish / Dead / Jam bands. I started collecting records around that time, but only jam band available on vinyl were the Dead.  So I started collecting prog rock and jazz fusion on vinyl.  I got into Zappa, Miles Davis, Herbie Hancock, etc.  From there I got into r&b and soul.  In the late 00's I took a break from collecting and focused on digital.   In the early 2010s I got back into vinyl hard, and started collecting every classic rock and alt rock album I ever liked.  I rediscovered some classic rock artists, and their deeper cuts, by listening to them on vinyl.  Artists like Clapton, Stones, Dylan, and Neil Young.  Clapton got me into collecting strictly blues records for about a year or so.  Dylan got me into collecting folk for a little bit.  The Stones and Neil have finally gotten me into collecting classic country records.    TL;DR to answer your question:  Collecting vinyl has gotten me into Jazz, Prog Rock, R&B, Blues, Folk, Country, and everything in between."

Then it was a steady excursion through Beatles, Who, Hendrix, Floyd, Deep Purple, Thin Lizzy. But after hearing Yes and Genesis, my habits really changed. I started going to the local record stores and diving into $1 bins anywhere that had them. If it listed someone playing Moog synthesizers or 12 string guitars, I bought it."

It has, however, killed a lot of the exploration I used to make. I buy albums I know I love for the most part. I find myself listening to vinyl more than digital because I paid for the vinyl so I prioritize it over the stuff I've pirated. Whereas I used to download and listen to tons of new stuff, now I just find myself listening to the things I already know because that's what is in my collection.

Instead it goes in metal neighborhood mailbox cluster, which is essentially an oven for vinyl in this weather.

Several posts were saying that it sounds more natural, spacier and alive and that the bass is nicer than on the other versions they compared it to.  So it's a pure collector/compulsive thing I guess :)"
vinyl,3bm0bg,H8Blood,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:58:31 2015 UTC,"There is something to be said about an analog capture of a digital file played back on a top notch dac most of us will never be able to afford. That said, being blessed with a (well, moderately) good dac, I'm able to take full advantage of what I feel is the purest available version of that recording and what is closest to the actual master recording. I couldn't imagine the tonality being better without liberal EQ, and definitely not the dynamic range. And again, I have not heard the MFSL for myself, so it is all conjecture on my behalf. I am sure it is the best version available on vinyl though - that coming from someone who owns plenty of MoFi's other releases, both 33 and 45 RPM!  If someone really wants that album on vinyl, by all means, go for it. It's just hard to recommend a $50+ reissue when there's a original issue from 30 years ago which can be had for like, $1 or less, and is most likely superior."
vinyl,3bm0bg,MrRom92,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:51:58 2015 UTC,"The point many people made that the original version, mastered by Bob Ludwig, has shortened versions of the songs. The one mastered by Stan Ricker has a really bad dynamic range and the one mastered by Chris Bellman is really good with the MoFi release still being a little bit better.  So the ranking through various forums seems to be  MoFi > Bellmann > Ludwig >>> Ricker  which would mean that the original issue is ranked at 3rd place. Though the difference between the first three doesn't seem that big. Besides the fact that the original issue doesn't have the full-length versions of most of the tracks. Only ""The Man's Too Strong"" and ""One World"" weren't shortened for the original vinyl release."

Of the vinyl releases I have no doubts that the newest one is the one which can't be topped. But when you throw CD into the mix, the original issue is basically a digital clone of the original master - the album was tracked to 16/48 and mixed through analog boards to 16/44.1 digital tape."

vinyl,3bm0bg,MrRom92,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:01:45 2015 UTC,"It should be pointed out that this is essentially a ""legal bootleg"". Actually, depending on where you live, it's probably just a bootleg. In either case, the quality on these is poor and they are well worth avoiding. Even more so if they used false stereo processing from a mono source when this album already sounds great in true stereo as it originally did over half a century ago. But I suppose that's about as much as you can expect from European PD labels."

vinyl,3bnogx,chippewhattha,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:23:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for not calling this antique.  This looks like a 1960's model.  Many aspects of this design endured into the 1980's; it looks a lot like the BSR table that was part of my first Panasonic system.  The cool thing about it is that it also plays 78 RPM and will do that very well if the stylus is flipped to its 78 RPM ""side"".  The 16 speed is for large radio transcription discs, some books-on-record, or understanding how the Chipmunks recordings were made! Patton Oswalt on the topic."
vinyl,3bowwj,Toast911,2,Tue Jun 30 23:22:41 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I would just research things as you find them, but for turntables, a good quick thing to check is things like the counterweight and whether it still has the stylus or not. If the counterweight is just a piece of plastic and isn't adjustable, it's automatically crap. If the stylus is broken, replacing it is generally at least $20+, so factor that into the price. Generally speaking, all-in-one units are low quality, especially if they bear the Crosley name. Beyond that, ask someone else, cuz that's pretty much the bulk of my knowledge, haha."

vinyl,3bowwj,parccedres,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:26:03 2015 UTC,"The real tricky part is that there are plenty of good brands that made good tables but every single brand made at least one cheap or crappy table. Do some research of your own and dig through the sidebar, the search, and other forums like VinylEngine, Audiokarma, perhaps SteveHoffmanForums, etc. This is just a very big very open question because there's 50+ years of hifi equipment out there, and hifi used to be the onlyfi until the more portable stuff in the 80s/90s.   That being said, here's some good brands that I've found commonly at garage sales/swap meets/etc:  Technics  Pioneer  Marantz  Denon  Kenwood (older = better, avoid anything past 1980 pretty much)  Philips made some good stuff  If you're lucky you'll find a Thorens. Buy it. Same goes for Rega.  There's also tons of tables, amps, and speakers that aren't these basic and very popular brands. That's why there's the intro guide, so you learn to look for the features of a quality table/amp/speakers and not just the brand."

vinyl,3bkhy8,ryguydrummerboy,4,Mon Jun 29 23:31:54 2015 UTC,"“Self-Titled” Compiled singles recorded from May 17th 1953 – November 30th 1955   After five years on Atlantic Records, Charles finally released his first Lp – the self-titled “Ray Charles” sometimes also known as “Rock and Roll.” Contextually, Charles’ first was part of Atlantic’s Popular 8000 series of Lp’s that featured similar cover art from the likes of Ruth Brown, Clyde McPhatter, Joe Turner, LaVerne Baker and more. His album would be would be comprised of various singles dating as far back as May 1953. The numbers featured on this album were often jump or boogie woogie styles that were not part of Charles’ repertoire later in his career. Nonetheless many of the songs remain some of his best – the boogie filled “Mess Around” featured Charles playing a fantastic stride piano technique while songs like “I Got a Woman” and “Hallelujah I Love You So” found one of the first instances of gospel influences in a popular music context. Though he was mostly playing black theatres around the country, Charles’ first Lp would propel him onto the bigger stages of the Newport Jazz Festival.   “The Great Ray Charles” Recorded April 30th 1956 – November 26th 1956   Sonically, this album featured an entirely different Charles. Whereas “Rock and Roll” was filled with what had essentially become Charles’ greatest popular hits of his five year career with Atlantic, “The Great Ray Charles” found the Genius in an instrumental jazz setting. The Atlantic Jazz 1200 Lp series featured artists like Errol Garner, Dizzy Gillespie, Charles Mingus, and Milt Jackson. When I first got this Lp I was pretty confused as I was only familiar with Charles’ signature voice and ability to make any song his own. However I was also pleasantly surprised with his jazz capabilities. Recorded from April - November of 1956, some good songs for me are “Black Coffee” and “Sweet Sixteen Bars.”   “Soul Brothers” Recorded September 12th 1957   “Soul Brothers” is an absolutely fantastic album that once again surprised me with its instrumental nature. Here Charles not only plays piano but is found a number of times on Alto Sax. His sax skills were actually pretty damn good and you wonder why he never really picked it up again later in his career. Also featured on this album is the killer vibraphone player, Milt Jackson. Milt lends his talents on vibes but also on piano and guitar a few times throughout the album. Every track on the Lp is something new and fantastic and I highly recommend it to any jazz fans out there.    “At Newport” Recorded July 5th 1958   Recorded at Newport Jazz, this festival would’ve been a sight to see. For four days Duke Ellington, Dave Brubeck, Miles Davis, Benny Goodman, Chuck Berry (lol?), Mahalia Jackson, Sonny Rollins, Thelonious Monk, Max Roach, Louis Armstrong, Ray Charles and more played the star-studded event. Charles’ performance came on the third day after Big Joe Turner. This is one of my favorite Ray Charles albums as it features a mix of jazz and popular tunes. The “Blue Waltz” is a fantastic blues in triple time is a great follow up to the fiery and soulful “(Night Time is the) Right Time” and extended “I Got a Woman.” I highly recommend this album to anyone looking to starting a Ray Charles binge.    “What’d I Say” Compiled recordings from September 11th – February 18th 1959   This Lp features recordings from a seven year window but the focus of the album is the title track that was last to be recorded. “What’d I Say” is a rhythm & blues track that that famously came from a late-night improvisation when Charles and his band ran out of prepared songs for a gig. The audience response was phenomenal so it was recorded right away. The gospel call & response, the rhumba influence, and heavy sexual innuendo lead to a mixed response but in the end it would be Charles’ first gold record.    “In Person” Recorded May 28th 1958   All the way down in Atlanta, GA Charles played Morris Brown College’s Herdon Stadium with his band and Raelettes. For an album recorded with only one microphone, the sound quality is not too bad for 1958 (though I do prefer the sound of Newport more). Nonetheless the setlist is killer and features fantastic runs of “What’d I Say” and “Drown in My Own Tears.”   “The Genius of Ray Charles” Recorded May 9th 1959 – June 23rd 1959   Yet again, Charles displays a new sound on his Atlantic jazz 1300 Lp series debut. The Genius is featured amongst a number of guest musicians from the Count Basie Orchestra and Duke Ellington Band. Accordingly, much of the first half of this Lp is in the big band style with numbers like Louis Jordan’s jump blues “Let the Good Times Roll.” Another great tune is “Deed I Do.” I’d also like to shoutout to David “Fathead” Newman’s tenor solos. Sexy. The back half of the Lp features Charles on a number of string arrangements. Not necessarily my bag but throughout the entire Lp Charles lends his soulful voice to some old tunes.    “The Genius Sings the Blues” Compiled recordings from September 11th 1952 – June 26th 1959   This would be Ray Charles’ final album on Atlantic Records. Before the album was even released in 1961, Charles had jumped to the major ABC Records who had offered a deal that is largely considered one of the best recording contracts at the time (Charles not only received a ton of money, but kept the rights to his songs which was unheard of. Atlantic simply couldn’t match the offer as much as he was willing to stay.) “Genius Sings the Blues” features 12 blues songs recorded over his seven year stint with Atlantic. Songs like “the Midnight Hour” can feel dragging and outdated on this record but offer a fine performance nonetheless. Charles really shines on “Movin On,” “Night Time is the Right Time” and “I Believe to My Soul.” Uncoincidentally these were his final tracks with Atlantic before leaving."

After reading your descriptions and since I'm also a big fan of classic jazz, I'm interested in hearing ""Soul Brothers"" & ""At Newport"".

But, I found a good quality DSOTM MoFi I could not pass up, and I thought it looked nice with the other original master recordings (except for Stevie).    As for the less obvious records, Budos Band and Other Lives, both are solid evening selections.    Budos Band, with its heavy Ethio-Jazz thumping, is probably best for a dinner party with light to moderate imbibing.  See also, Mulatu Astatke and Tinariwen (to wind things down).    Other Lives has taken a new direction on this album (Rituals).  Whereas before, on Tamer Animals, they were a spacier Fleet Foxes, this album is much more relaxed and less structured.  An excellent choice for a quiet Sunday evening."

vinyl,3bkwlr,HBK42581,2,Tue Jun 30 01:37:02 2015 UTC,"So, finally got the apartment all set up and looking the way I want. This is my starter kit. It consists of an Onkyo TX-8020 receiver, Technics SL-D2 turntable with the Shure m97xe cart and stylus installed. The speakers are two KLH 9912S and two Aiwa SX-A1000. I got all four of them from a coworker for $60 total and I figured they were better than what I had. I figure my next TT will probably be an Orbit and shortly after that I'll upgrade my towers. For a starter set, though, this stuff works just fine."
vinyl,3bkwlr,adayinalife,3,Tue Jun 30 01:41:26 2015 UTC,"figure my next TT will probably be an Orbit   Unless there is something wrong with the D2, buying a Orbit will be a significant downgrade. I'd spend the money on speakers :)"
vinyl,3bkwlr,adayinalife,2,Tue Jun 30 01:46:30 2015 UTC,Good to know. I just assumed newer would be better. That frees up some cash. These speakers do kinda sound like shit. Haha.
vinyl,3bkwlr,aretone,4,Tue Jun 30 01:47:37 2015 UTC,"I just assumed newer would be better.   Definitely not the case, vintage tables are definitely best bang for your buck. You'd probably have to spend closer to $1k for a new deck to start seeing an improvement."

vinyl,3bjn4g,dethrock,2,Mon Jun 29 19:48:19 2015 UTC,Looks to me like a Technics receiver.  Onboard phono stage.
vinyl,3bjn4g,LaserRanger,5,Mon Jun 29 19:50:05 2015 UTC,Yeah he mentioned he was using a Technics receiver and an Amazon phono stage. Just wondering if he upgraded as it would most certainly be holding him back.
vinyl,3bjn4g,dethrock,2,Mon Jun 29 19:54:13 2015 UTC,You're right.  Reading comprehension fail on my part.  I don't know why you would use an external amp when the onboard phono stage is fine.
vinyl,3bjn4g,LaserRanger,2,Mon Jun 29 19:56:26 2015 UTC,No problem. I had a vintage Rotel amp that I was using the built in phono stage. I borrowed a Azur 551p to test out to see if I could tell a difference. It absolutely stomped the Rotel's phono. I'm not familiar with Technics but a separate phono stage can make a HUGE difference.
vinyl,3bjn4g,dethrock,2,Mon Jun 29 19:58:29 2015 UTC,That's interesting.  Something to think about I guess.  As if I need more gear!
vinyl,3bjn4g,LaserRanger,2,Mon Jun 29 20:00:59 2015 UTC,Just because it worked in my case doesn't mean it would do the same for you. I'd definitely recommend trying to borrow one from a friend or a hi-fi store where you live. It was honestly a night and day difference for me.

vinyl,3bjn4g,Foozlebop,2,Mon Jun 29 21:59:23 2015 UTC,So for a phono preamp I'm using a TCC from Amazon. It's got a volume knob I use instead of the one on the technics. The phono stage on the technics has some weird issues that I don't feel like paying to get worked out.  Id love to eliminate the phono pre and get into a marantz or something rebuilt or in better condition.

vinyl,3bjn4g,DOctorAZ,3,Mon Jun 29 20:40:39 2015 UTC,"YES. the turntable honestly gave me the biggest sound improvement. The tracking is so on point and the whole setup is just soooooo well built.

vinyl,3ble51,Un0va,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:47:36 2015 UTC,Yeah you'd think for the ridiculous amount they charge for shipping (which is about 2-3x your typical Discogs purchase from across the pond) they could add some extra cardboard or bubble wrap.  Nope.

They charge exorbitant amounts for shipping and ship in substandard containers without padding, without corner/edge protection, and without any option to remove the LPs from the sleeves to avoid split seams.  Despite so many complaints, they continue to ship this way.  Should we have to pay for insurance to avoid what a dollar's worth of cardboard and bubble wrap would prevent in the first place?    IMO, no, which is why I'll never risk ordering from them again."

I've only seen one version of the vinyl here in the U.S. and it didn't have any indication of where it was made or mastering info.

That feels much less offensive than having people tell you you've done something wrong every time you make a mistake.

vinyl,3bnb61,Timewindows,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:32:52 2015 UTC,"The ""really small disc"" is called a 45.  It spins at 45 revolutions per minute as opposed to 33.3 like LPs.  It's how singles were released.  That 2525 song was a single and it has a b side of another song the band wanted heard. The table you bought is not a good one, but is fine for cheapies you don't care about.  Read up here and ask and you will quickly learn what to look for. New records are often thicker (180g) and may skip on tables like your califone.  That is a problem with the table and not the record.  The age of the table has nothing to do with it.  Crappy old ones exist as do crappy new ones, and high quality old and new as well.  A good table will play everything."

Already outing myself as the biggest stupid of all, I guess I should dive all the way in. I have a modest collection that's mostly decorative, but I was gifted a Jensen JTA-230 that I now have hooked up to my Pioneer (Elite X-Z9) amp/sound system I'm already using on my TV setup. Do those have the same reputation for damaging records as Crosleys? And I'm not getting any bass from the speakers, do I have any cheap options to enhance that, or is it just what it is until I can upgrade the whole thing?"
vinyl,3bi7l7,ohsnapitsjf,11,Mon Jun 29 14:08:58 2015 UTC,"Do those have the same reputation for damaging records as Crosleys?   Pretty much, yes. As far as I can tell the Jensen JTA-230 is a cheap all-in-one system very similar to most Crosleys and will come with pretty much all the same issues that a Crosley does.  EDIT: I'm not very knowledgeable when it comes to speakers, but I just came across this on an Amazon review of the JTA-230:   The USB output, RCA line level output, and headphone jack all work fine, but sounds tinny and lacking in bass, so playing it through larger speakers really doesn't improve the sound quality that much compared to the small built-in speakers. Even if you try to boost the bass using an equalizer, it still won't sound hi-fi.   So the turntable might be your problem there as well."
vinyl,3bi7l7,rpbtz,3,Mon Jun 29 14:16:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I'm not all that concerned about lousy sound (it'd be nice, but I don't own any records I can't listen to in more convenient ways anyway), but if this will cause actual damage, it'll stay a novelty for me for now."
vinyl,3bi7l7,ohsnapitsjf,3,Mon Jun 29 14:23:00 2015 UTC,"It will. Not from one day to the other, but it will wear down records noticeably faster than any decent turntable.

vinyl,3bi7l7,rpbtz,7,Mon Jun 29 14:27:06 2015 UTC,"To add to other responses your TT is on par with the Crosley type stuff, but here is why:  There is no way to adjust the counterbalance or anti-skate. What this means is that they are set from the factory to track very heavy to prevent skipping, but at the cost of additional wear to your albums. On better TT's you can set the tracking force and anti-skate to minimize both skipping and wear.  Now, you could definitely play some dollar bin stuff, but like others have noted anything higher quality I would store away for later.  My best guess is that your sound is due to the lack of a better phono pre-amp on the Jensen. It seems that it has one but it is severely lacking based on the reviews I can find. No surprise here, but honestly there's no need to spend more money trying to get better quality out of it. You'd be better off selling it and using that money to get a 70's or 80's TT from Craigslist."

Their impedance depends on the drivers themselves and the way they are wired.   On the other hand they may have a switch to select which impedance to use (series or parallel wiring) so you'd be good with them at 8ohms.  If you put a 4ohm load on a 8ohm rated amplifier, you could potentially damage it."

vinyl,3bi7l7,cok666n,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:08:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, I can daisy-chain a pair of speakers off the sub, and the crossover within the sub passes the appropriate signals out of the sub's range to the satellites.

If you have the chance to listen to an acrylic platter vs a normal one in a hifi/audio store (or elsewhere) I would do that and decide for yourself. $130 is a lot of money on something you're not sure on."

After some more probing it sounds like it would be most beneficial in a system that is pretty well dialed in to begin with. If your speakers, amplifier, pre-amp, and cartridge are all keeping you happy the acrylic platter might just help finish that final step.  Otherwise, $130 is probably better spent elsewhere in your system."

vinyl,3bi7l7,EmilioASStevez,3,Tue Jun 30 21:38:54 2015 UTC,"Not sure if this is the right place.   When I was in high school I found my dad's old turntable, plugged it into my stereo and spent about a year listening to his old records. Looking back on that experience, I don't know how the fuck this set up even worked. I know I didn't have a phono stage or phono inputs on my stereo. (It was one of those all-in-one sony things with a tape deck, cd player and speakers.) I also doubt the turntable had a built in preamp. It was a pioneer from the late 70s. But I don't have the model number.   I can remember specifically tearing off the ground wire because I didn't know what it was.   I've been doing research into a new system these last few weeks and looking back on the high school set up, I seriously have no idea how it even worked. Any thoughts?"
vinyl,3bi7l7,nameplace24,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:22:30 2015 UTC,"So, I'm bored and I've got some time on my hands so I'll take my stab at explaining this in basic terms.  The simplest reason a turntable needs a pre-amp is because it puts out a very low level signal. Much akin to playing your phone as a source, but leaving the volume on that at 10%. You then have to turn the amplifier (or the volume on your all-in-one) way up to get a reasonable level of sound out of it.  Now, with a turntable we use a pre-amp to bring that signal output to about even with other devices and do a bit of equalizing. This makes it so you can keep your amplifier at normal levels to get normal sound output.  So technically, not using a pre-amp will get you sound, it will just be very low volume. You were probably just turning the volume way the hell up to make it what you considered to be listenable. Looking back, I bet the sound quality was awful.  Now, the ground cable doesn't really directly affect the ability of the TT to work, it just means you'll make a ton of static electricity that won't get dissipated due to the friction of the needle on the vinyl. This in turn causes a lot of issues with sound quality, mostly a static background sound at all times. You probably didn't notice it because you didn't notice the terrible sound quality of missing the pre-amp.  Basically, what you did will functionally work, but it will sound absolutely horrible. Chances are you just didn't notice how bad it sounded."

vinyl,3bi7l7,goopitygoo,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:23:41 2015 UTC,"This is going to sound crazy weird and dangerous, but have you tried grounding the turntable to the outlet? Safest option is to get a grounding plug and replacing the plug altogether. Unsafe option, (open the breaker to the room where your tt is first) ground the turntable to the outlet with one of the screws on the faceplate (then close the breaker after it's done). Please dear god do not attempt the second option without looking into the safety aspects.  Otherwise, check the gain settings on the ART? Volume up gain down?"
vinyl,3bi7l7,itisrocketscience,2,Mon Jun 29 16:43:40 2015 UTC,"First option with the grounding plug may be my best bet, but more of a last resort - knowing my luck, I'll probably blow the power to the house or get electrocuted lol.

I have been attempting at starting a vinyl setup for about a year now, and recently I was given a Pro-ject Debut Carbon by my parents as a graduation gift. My dad and I went to the storage unit tonight and found that we still have my dad's old Klipsch KG 1.2 speakers, but that he either donated or otherwise got rid of his old technics receiver (which I was more bummed about than I expressed to him). My questions are:   I know it is recommended to replace the cartridge on a turntable, but is the one shipped with my turntable good? I know Pro-ject is a high-end brand, so I decided to ask on the off chance that the included cartridge (Ortofon 2M Red) is a good one. I realize I will have to align it properly. I realize there are guides for this, and I've got them bookmarked as well as looking over them in the past, but do any of  y'all have any recommendations for a reasonably priced receiver or amp? It's the last piece of the puzzle and I'm itching to let 'er rip."

That makes me wonder, what should I look for in a preamp? My receiver has a volume control, so that's not necessary in the preamp.  I've been looking at the Pro-Ject Phono Box, the NAD PP2e, and the Cambridge Audio 551P as these all fit my current budget and their reviews seem alright. If there are slightly more expensive ones that are noticeably better I can up my budget as well (I was thinking around $100-120 - but mind you that I don't live in the US and that prices often are 15-30% higher here than the US price would be).  Also, I'm aware of the cartridge/stylus issues with B&O tables, and if it turns out to need fixing (hard to tell before I'm able to actually listen to it playing) I'm ready to pay for a retipping and a new suspension."

I might have to look into the Art DJ-Pre. I have seen it mentioned here often and sort of just dismissed it as being one of the cheapest alternatives, but looking at a few reviews it actually sounds like a pretty decent buy for its price. No local stores seem to have it, but I guess I can order it online. Thanks :)"
vinyl,3bi7l7,rpbtz,2,Mon Jun 29 15:34:26 2015 UTC,It also give you more money to retip or refurb the B&O Cart/Needle. I do have to say that the Art doesn't have as minimalist a case as the other phono boxes. The Art is also a step up from the Pyle and Behringer preamps that are also pretty common.

Seeing how I can afford it I didn't see any reason to just find the cheapest option if I can get something better for a little more.  As for the case I don't really care. My receiver and CD player is from NAD so of course that would fit in better, but really, design is the least of my concerns in this case.  The money for an eventual retipping was already set aside separately from my preamp budget, so no worries, although it never hurt anyone to save a little extra money ;)"

vinyl,3bi7l7,itisrocketscience,2,Mon Jun 29 15:46:12 2015 UTC,"I have a question about digitizing music. I do not have a turntable with a USB output. So I basically have my stereo hooked to my computer's line-in going from the Tape 2 REC output using a RCA to 3.5 mm cable. However I get a pretty noticeable buzz on every recording. The noise removal on audacity can pretty much take care of it without noticeably effecting the music (just want to put on my iPod to listen on the car stereo). But I was discussing the issue with my brother and he suggested to buy an USB audio preamp, as it might eliminate the buzz. The problem is I use Ubuntu so not everything available will necessarily have a driver written for it to work with my OS. I did some research into USB preamps on Ubuntu forums and didn't find much for using it as I would like to (and to be honest, a lot of it went over my head--only use ubuntu because its free). So my question is, you people with non-USB-output-turntables, how do you digitize music? Do you use a preamp or have it hooked straight to the line-in like me, or is it some other weird thing I can't even imagine? And more specifically, what type of USB preamp would you suggest for around $50-75 that would work with Ubuntu 14.04, if a USB preamp is in fact the way to go?  edit:a letter and a word"

The stylus assembly is clipped on to the cartridge, which is the black plastic and metal item with four pins in the back that is attached with two screws to the headshell.

vinyl,3bi7l7,thesneakywalrus,2,Tue Jun 30 00:01:47 2015 UTC,Recently picked up a Nagaoka MP-110. Magnificent sound to this cartridge. Quite happy with this purchase but I am noticing something a little frustrating - I get occasional small ticks on perfectly clean records. This seems to happen at same point on each rotation of the album. I tried remounting and repositioning the cartridge on the headshell and this seems to have somewhat improved the situation but it still exists albeit to a slightly lesser extent. These are minor pops but still noticeable to a keen ear. This has not happened with my previous AT95-E or Ortofon MK11 cartridges. Then I noticed the wire leads on my headshell seemed kind of damaged. The green wire had actually disconnected from the base of the headshell end of the cartridge when I remounted but I glued it back on and everything seems fine in terms of sound (both channels functioning). Cutting to the chase here - what is the possible cause for these ticks? Could the headshell wires be the cause or is it maybe even that the cartridge is still breaking in? Any other suggestions?

I'm fairly new to collecting and I was recently lucky enough to be able to upgrade my turntable from an old handmedown from my parents to an Audio-Technica AT-LP120-USB from a crazy deal I was able to swing. I was going to build my new setup around the new turntable but I'm having trouble trying to figure out how to connect the speakers to my turntable. The turntable came with a built in preamp, but also only comes with RCA connections for speakers. Most of the larger floorstanding speakers I've been looking at buying use the standard terminals with speaker wire as their connection. I know I need some sort of amp if I want to use non active speakers but I was wondering which ones to get and what would be the best way to set it up. I was hoping to avoid getting a whole receiver to keep my setup as minimal as possible, so I'm mostly looking for a way around that. If someone could at least give me some guidance it would greatly appreciated. If someone has any recommendations for what to get price isn't too big of any issue, but like with everything else cheaper is always nice.

vinyl,3bi7l7,TheBird47,2,Thu Jul 2 06:24:35 2015 UTC,"For a beginner, is it fine to use powered computer speakers instead of traditional bookshelf speakers? I'm on a budget and would rather spend more money on vinyl than a stereo system worth hundreds of dollars. I'll upgrade in the future, this is just to start. Would a $100 turntable with a built in preamp and some powered computer speakers sound decent enough to start with?"
vinyl,3bi7l7,MyFriend_BobSacomano,3,Fri Jul 3 03:28:49 2015 UTC,"For a beginner, is it fine to use powered computer speakers instead of traditional bookshelf speakers?   Yes, perfectly fine to start of with. It's harder to upgrade since you can't upgrade separate components but as a starting point it will work.   Would a $100 turntable with a built in preamp and some powered computer speakers sound decent enough to start with?   I am assuming you are referring to the LP60. The honest truth is that this table divides people on here. Due to the nature of the tone arm (non adjustable), it can either work fine or be completely useless. If it was setup correctly at the factory it will work, and be adequate to get your feet wet. If not, a common occurrence with these tables, it will suffer terrible playback issues, potentially resulting in damage to the record itself. I had a similar table (Hanpin makes pretty much every single one of these low end tables for different companies), and it would skip on pretty much every single record I would throw at it.  The other aspect to consider is that records are not cheap these days, if you plan on buying new records it's very much worth while buying a more capable player. I personally do not see the point in playing $50 records on a $100 new player. Just some things to consider."
vinyl,3bi7l7,adayinalife,2,Fri Jul 3 05:53:13 2015 UTC,"That was actually another question I was going to ask, whether the LP60 (correct, that is the one I was looking at) will damage records, and whether it's worth it to play new records on it. Their website says it has a tracking weight of 3g which from what I understand is not too bad. Is there still a risk of damaging records then? It seems like it's impossible to get a budget TT that sounds decent and won't shred records.  Perhaps I could get the upgrade package: http://www.lpgear.com/product/UPATPL60.html Maybe that'd lessen the damage? If I spend an extra $40 I might as well just get the 120 which from what I understand is much better."

vinyl,3bi7l7,Toorvanda,2,Sat Jul 4 16:19:38 2015 UTC,"Well, (speaking from my biased position,) let me talk about some of the benefits of getting a new table. The benefits of buying used are pretty self-explanatory - choose the path that best fits your needs.  First is warranty. If it's not what you need, were led to expect, or if it's just not working right, you've got protection with a new table that you just can't get with vintage.  Second is performance. (Perhaps that should be first, but this isn't necessarily 'in order.') There are a lot of cool vintage tables out there, but my friends who service and sell both vintage and new all agree that in the price range, the musical fidelity available from a new table is superior to that of what's commonly available used. There are always exceptions, but you need to be patient and lucky  Third is support. If you buy a table from a local hifi specialist, you can audition the products on offer, get guidance to the best things to look at, and eventually make an educated decision with confidence that you're spending your money on the best possible solution for you. Some other choice may be better for some other person, but you'll have the experience to feel good about your own choice, ensuring the highest value for your money. PLUS, and a lot of people underestimate the value of this when they're considering buying used or online, a local specialist that you purchase from becomes your personal consultant after the sale. If you have questions or concerns, they will be available to help guide you through - making sure your system is set up properly and that things are all going as well as possible. Otherwise your after-sale support options are pretty much ""return and start over"" or ""tough it out with what you have."""

I am in germany.  Hello everybody,  if I understood this correctly this is a question and answer thread where I can post questions and potentially get answers, if not I am very sorry, I am still new to this sub!  Anyway, 2 months ago I got into the whole vinyl stuff after finding an old turntable and some speakers in my grandmas basement. With it, I found several Jazz records. Unfortunately the turntable was completely broken. I went ahead and bought a cheap turntable and a receiver at a very small local thrift store. I used the speakers I found in the basement and got a working setup for around 100€ which consists of a Dual CS520, a Kenwood KR-725 and Schneider LB 112.5 speakers. Two months pass and I bought some of my favorite releases on vinyl and now have a small collection of 18 records which keeps growing.  While this setup works for now I want to upgrade. I am not looking to spent a few thousand euros on audio equipment, I just want a decent setup with a decent sound to listen to my music! I am looking to spend around 700€ if that's possible.  After I have done some research, comparing back and forth and reading some user opinions in this sub (which wasn't easy since one product could either be really good or really bad, make up your minds haha) I settled on the Pro-Ject Debut Carbon (around 350€ on german amazon). Now for the remaining 350€ I need a receiver and some speakers to go with it, because a good turntable is of no use if the rest is crap. I am really open to anything. Vintage receiver with phono in, modern receiver with pre-amp etc. etc.  Keep in mind that I live in germany and maybe not everything that you know is available here. I hope you can help me out.  EDIT: I found a Hi-Fi shop not all that far from where I live. I will probably visit them some time this week and see if they can help me as well!"

vinyl,3bi7l7,youshouldreadthem,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:11:27 2015 UTC,I need to buy a new needle but I don't want to spend over $30 or $40.  I have a U Turn Orbit and I know the arm isn't adjustable so I can't just go buy any needle.  What do you guys suggest that I could use?
vinyl,3bi7l7,arkanpillow,4,Tue Jun 30 23:06:27 2015 UTC,"The arm is adjustable, you just need a tracking force gauge."
vinyl,3bi7l7,adayinalife,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:34:36 2015 UTC,what can i use that should be the correct weight where I don't have to get one of those?  my needle broke and i'm just trying to get it replaced as soon as possible.
vinyl,3bi7l7,arkanpillow,3,Wed Jul 1 00:01:44 2015 UTC,What cartridge/needle came with your Uturn?
