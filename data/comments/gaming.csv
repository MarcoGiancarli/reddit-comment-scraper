You can find them with the noclip command (don't remember what it's called) and you can take things out of the chest if you unlock it.

gaming,3e2dud,Rathum,105,Tue Jul 21 17:35:44 2015 UTC,"In Oblivion you could permanently ""kill"" guards. This was caused by the intersection of four game mechanics.   If a character ran out of stamina they would be knocked out (knocked down flat) until they regenerated a portion of their max stamina. NPCs would equip items they find or pick up, including dropped weapons when attacked, they preferred wearing their already equipped items however. You can reverse-pickpocket items onto NPCs, but only if it had a weight of 0 or was a poison. There were actually only a finite number of respawning guards in the game, taking up a set block of NPC ref IDs.   With these mechanics in place, you could enchant a batte-mage's hood, which had 0 weight, with a curse of stamina draining, which could only be acquired in a single place in the game with the enchantment ""-5 stamina per second"".  Then you can pickpocket the helmet off a guard and reverse the hood on to them and then knock them out (or wait for them to go to sleep), and when they get up they will equip the cursed hood themselves.  Eventually their stamina would drain completely and they would be knocked out. Since the hood drained their stamina faster than it regenerated though, they will never get up and be permanently knocked out.  You then proceed to repeat this for all the guards that spawn, and when that particular guard with that ID respawns, he will retain the hood, meaning a few seconds after he spawns he will be knocked out forever as well.  You then proceed to do whatever illegal thing you want because every guard in the city is permasleeping.  edit: Mr. Sandman Khajiit is here to take all your swag, yes he is."

gaming,3e2dud,NaomiNekomimi,55,Tue Jul 21 16:09:56 2015 UTC,"I don't know much about the actual engine, but this is what I believe is going on based on my observations:  I think it is most likely some kind of floating point rounding problem.  When you get geometry overlapping, the physics engine tries to compensate by ""bouncing"" the sprite object, if it overlaps with world geometry (or if both are sprites, the less dense/massive of the two).  If a small object (like a tin can) collides with the ground, it bounces a bit based on the properties defined in the physics engine.  Sometimes if an object's hit box overlaps too much, the engine tries to compensate by bouncing it away faster.  When you get to really small distance numbers, rounding error can cause big differences, meaning that the overlapped object ends up getting way too much velocity.  A really good (and repeatable) example is from Skyrim.  If you let one of the frost giants smack you with his overhand club smash, your character will fly hundreds of miles in the air.  The character hit box gets embedded into the ground, combined with the velocity imparted by the club hit, causes the rebound to send the player's corpse (or soon to be corpse if you survive) upwards much too fast."

gaming,3e2dud,manondorf,9,Tue Jul 21 17:31:42 2015 UTC,"Probably.  The hit boxes for the small items are an actual box that encompasses the whole object.  It is often larger than the actual object, so when an item is sitting on the table, the code locks it in the place it was originally coded to stay until the player interacts with it.  Then the physics engine takes over and tries to reposition it based on the hit box of the table and the object on the table, leading to floating items, and silverware explosions."
gaming,3e2dud,CodeMonkey24,4,Tue Jul 21 17:39:45 2015 UTC,"In addition to the moon bounce /u/codemonkey24 mentioned, there is just general weirdness from picking things up sometimes.

If you drop an item in a weird spot it can flip wildly or knock everything near it away like you dropped a grenade. The engine really doesn't handle small physics objects being interacted with."

They could have also prerendered that footage and not bothered placing character models around; then again they may have actually done that, and the models were left in place so that it'll be easier for the devs to go back and create more riddler scenes in any specific spot.  It really depends on what the devs actually need something to do.

Which means they were fast but they were holding weapons that slowed their speed down to ship-speed.  A monk was abusing the fact that NPCs like this could be used to practice disarming.  There was a rare chance within a rare chance within a miracle (very low since the boat was considered high level) that the boat could be disarmed and it was.   It's weapons dropped to the ground and the boat went from 50 mph to about 4000mph.  People were making the journey within a minute considering it was scripted to stop at every island.

Rather than wasting time making a true boat travel system, they made a tangible object that was an NPC entity.  Rather than spending a month making a new type of entity and then figure out the bugs for this new entity, they could use an already existing entity and add the new features.  If something went wrong and it was something about the entity type they were using since the beginning, there was probably documentation or FAQs of how to solve it."

gaming,3e2dud,Scorps,21,Tue Jul 21 15:40:58 2015 UTC,"I swear I remember reading a post from a year or two ago on SOE that revealed Quillmane and also the Ancient Cyclops actual code for spawning.  Quillmane is something like there are 2 placeholders, always a lioness and an elephant calf that can spawn and roam paths, you have to kill both of them which is the trigger for Quillmane to potentially spawn (still very low chance).  He would spawn at 1 of 3 locations so essentially you need to have 4 people, one camping each potential spawn and a ranger or someone with track running around to kill the placeholders.  The AC is even crazier, there were like 3 separate spawn timers running and only one of them had a chance to be AC or one of his placeholders even though all the mobs from all 3 cycles spawned on the exact same point. (http://wiki.project1999.com/Ancient_Cyclops)  I remember a friend and I had basically deduced about 60% of what was going on with the AC and were able to sell 10+ Jboots multiquests in a week or so by just constantly camping there.  Holy shit EQ was a great game, this post has brought up some SERIOUS nostalgia"
gaming,3e2dud,gigafaunca,6,Tue Jul 21 16:28:18 2015 UTC,The AC code was released. I've seen it.  People timed it so they would kill the placeholders so it would spawn as soon as it flipped to night time.  I have not seen a good 100% explanation of Quillimane yet though.

Around the time just before I was in sixth form (roughly 5 years ago) there was a website that became really popular here in the UK called TrueLad. It was a website that perfectly pandered to the lad culture. Basically you submitted short stories about things you or your mates have done and people either upvoted or downvoted depending on whether it was a ""Good Lad"" or ""Shit Lad"". A bit like /r/TIFU.  Eventually, they decided to create a book compiling all these stories and call it ""The Lad Bible"". The problem was, they were fucking slow. For ages, the Lad Bible bit of the website was just ""in development"". I assume that at some point somebody had the genius idea of using TrueLad's popularity and use the name ""Lad Bible"" to promote their page.

gaming,3e2t0w,Otter_King,3,Tue Jul 21 15:49:03 2015 UTC,"Now I'm really bad with my knowledge of technical capabilities and stuff, but what is preventing the game designer from creating CGI cut scenes like this for the entire game, or even witcher 3?  Is it not like just playing a video?  I'm sure it either comes down to money or memory, but if someone understands it, that would be cool."
gaming,3e2t0w,imustbedelusional,9,Tue Jul 21 16:22:24 2015 UTC,"The videos take a huge amount of space and I think most people like cut scenes to be in-engine for immersion, as its kinda jarring to go from a super sexy cut-scene to blocky, stiff box-men."
gaming,3e2t0w,Otter_King,3,Tue Jul 21 16:37:31 2015 UTC,"Makes sense.  I was just curious.  Yesterday I was playing some Witcher 3, and any cut scene were two characters kiss always throws me off, the block type nature of the lips never match up and it turns what was previously a well written romance subplot into something that I can almost laugh at for a moment.  Other than that, the in game cut scenes are fine."
gaming,3e2t0w,imustbedelusional,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:56:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the romance scenes in the witcher look super weird haha. Looks like dolls making out,  damn creepy"
gaming,3e2t0w,MNico,5,Tue Jul 21 18:42:38 2015 UTC,"You pretty much got it. Money is definitely a big issue. CGI is very expensive, so it's much better to have the majority or entirety of a game's cutscenes to be made with the game engine. Some games like The Witcher 2 & 3 will spring for a cinematic opening, but it would be unwise to take it much further than that. Some games have a cinematic closer, too, such as Halo 4. The only games that are at all likely to have pre-rendered cutscenes are RTS games, such as Halo Wars, whose cutscenes were all CGI, and this is, of course, due to the less cinematic nature of the gameplay in that genre.  And memory is the other big issue. Video takes up much more space than in-engine stuff, so having a bunch of video content in a game can exponentially increase the amount of hard drive space the game takes up. A simple game like South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play! took up like 1gb despite being a 2D tower defense game from 2009, all because it was filled with clips from the show."
gaming,3e2t0w,Krustoff,3,Tue Jul 21 16:39:52 2015 UTC,Money for sure. Creating these type of videos is usually so expensive that they just outsource them to cinematic studios like Blur who have quite the impressive portfolio.
gaming,3e2t0w,shiftygopher,2,Tue Jul 21 16:44:03 2015 UTC,"Mostly cash.  Developing full action scenes like that takes a LOT of time and a lot of money. Doing a full 1-2 hours is a pretty hefty undertaking.  And Witcher 2/3 are 40 hours long. You'd either get jarring mis-matches of 'game looks like X, video looks like Y' (which is made worse by your character armor and weapons changing, so he'd teleport back to 'stock' every time you did a video), or you basically don't use much/any CGI, and just do it all with the in-game engine.  At least with the latter, everything flows and looks how it did 10 seconds ago."

gaming,3dywhr,10_of_spades,17,Mon Jul 20 22:14:34 2015 UTC,"Sure, eventually you can craft gear that is tenfolds better. There are still a few that serve their purpose at the point in time you get them. The Black Star never ceases to be useful, the Dawnbreaker is obtainable at level 12 and decent at that point. Similarly the mask of Clavicus Vile (the axe isn't the proper Daedric weapon and is purposefully shit!) is obtained at level 10 and that early on, getting 20% discounts on everything is huge. It's not like they're useless. But I agree they get outpaced fairly quickly if you grind the production skills, which has systematically been the way to abuse and break the Elder Scrolls games."

Since the leveling system is dependent on XP from doing activities, not quest completion, you don't get any XP from quests. So what do you get? You get either gold or items (or sometimes houses). Gold becomes virtually useless halfway into the game, as you've acquired so much at that point. Items are the same. When I already have full dragonplate, what can quest rewards offer me to feel motivated?   Without modding, the only solution I've found is to NEVER take perks in smithing. This forces you to rely on looted items, vendors, or quest rewards to get better gear. I've been thinking about making a mod to redesign the leveling process and pacing of item upgrades but I haven't found the time for it."

gaming,3dywhr,Hereticalnerd,3,Mon Jul 20 22:27:04 2015 UTC,"Strangely, I enjoyed Inquisition the most, Dragon Age 2 is a very close second, and Origins was really good, I just didn't care for the gameplay.... I still played through the entirety of the game 3 times. Yes, Dragon Age 2 has its problems, namely the lack of unique environments, but it was easy for me to suspend disbelief because of the cast of characters at your side. For me, how they handled the character development of each and every character instantly made me forgive them for the lazy level designs.  The only thing I don't like about Inquisition is the inability to manage my own skill points like what was possible in DA:2. Otherwise, it took the best aspects of the first two games and threw them together, and introduced a new combat system that works relatively well."
gaming,3dywhr,TheMadBlimper,3,Tue Jul 21 00:29:04 2015 UTC,"See, I liked the first 2 because the side quests all felt like I was doing something. I rarely, if ever felt like I was just killing things, or collecting stuff. Inquisition's side quests ALL felt like I was checking boxes off a list."

Now when you say that, you obviously don't mean companion quests, right? As far as I can tell, the side quests exist solely to level the player up, and serve as filler. So, I know exactly where you're coming from.  I will say this: I massively enjoyed Inquisition because of how cinematic it was. That being said, I have at least 12 full playthroughs of DA:2, and I've only completed 1 run through of Inquisition. I got 33 hours into my second playthrough and just... stopped. Can't figure out why. Maybe it's one of those games you binge play through once a year or something."

You can also import the magical armor that is said to beat all other armors, worn by a legendary hero. You can import a steel sword you get when you complete a dentist's tooth collection by collecting every tooth from every monster in the game and a tooth from the last level of the brawling minigame, which has 100% damage modifier and IGNORES enemy armor entirely. Damage modifiers stack and its the most OP sword in the game, but you had to put in some actual effort to get it starting at the tutorial hub. It was the Witcher's version of gnome achievement from Half Life Episode 2. You have to go through the brawling minigame level by level too, no skipping ahead or you get locked out of the minigame forever if you don't do a brawling match for every hub.   The swords and armor are beaten by a dwarf blacksmith's generic crap in the starter village and it becomes useless past the tutorial."

Creation of levels in games is procedurally definitely design over art, but outcome isn't as absolute since something well enough designed can be judged as art."
gaming,3dzqpc,persistent_illusion,3,Tue Jul 21 13:12:47 2015 UTC,"I'd love to hear more about why you're judging it this way.  Although I don't know your criteria, one argument against your judgement could consider the emotive quality of a track like this, which has seemingly been designed to maximize that ""holy wow I'm awesome"" experience; which experience (I'm guessing) was arrived at by ""carving away"" at the level by the designer—playing the partially-completed level over and over, looking for the combination which would best satisfy the designer's taste. This transfer of a personal experience—perceived by the creator, received by the user—points to art for me."
gaming,3dzqpc,ewofij,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:25:09 2015 UTC,"Well, design doesn't exclude emotional response!  Indeed, most design these days takes the emotional response of the user/audience as an important, if not primary concern.  Designing experiences is the new hotness in the design world for the past 15 years or so, such that it even has a name and wikipedia page.  Procedurally, I would call level creation design because it is relies more on craft than talent, is undertaken on behalf of others rather than its own sake, is more a matter of arrangement than wholesale creation, and likely required extensive iteration.  Not that any one of these things is the definitive factor in the art vs design processes! But the combination of them all paint a very designerly picture.  Now, the outcome, if moving and beautiful! May be considered art, but the generating processes have more in common with design.  The judgement of the outcome as art is based more on its perception by its audience than the factors that led to its creation.  So on that front I can't say if it is in fact art or not, because ""it's art if enough people think it's art.""  This famous designer from midcentury had a really good way of putting these concepts, much better than me! I would highly suggest listening to this little video he put together back in the 70s: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xYi2rd1QCg"

gaming,3dzqpc,Ed-Zero,5,Tue Jul 21 02:05:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's an entire genre of maps in Trackmania. It's hard, but not as hard as it could be. Each environment has a single car, so even if the player changes the model the car will always work exactly the same. There's no render time or anything to create a track, so you can put down a track piece and instantly start it to test it. However, since it's a press forward map they always have to start from the beginning, so it can take a while to get to the track piece you put down. You can be really screwed if the car hits a track support, If it's too close you won't be able to put anything down to guide the car around or away from it"

gaming,3e2ntn,UpgradeTech,7,Tue Jul 21 14:17:32 2015 UTC,"The music used in Columbia is old enough that Thomas Edison himself would have listened to them on his phonograph cylinder player 100 years ago.   The designers probably went with the numerous disc players because they would be more recognizable as a music playing device. Most of the music of Columbia, of course, was released on 78 rpm shellac records which played on the many gramophones you see in the game.  Nowadays, the rivalry of the flat-disc record and the cylinder has largely been forgotten with the terms phonograph and gramophone nearly interchangeable in modern speech for a mechanical record player. Though gramophone seems more common in the UK and Americans may substitute Victrola.  However in 1912, the phonograph still referred to Edison’s cylinder player and gramophone for Berliner’s flat-disc player.  So far I've tracked down at least four songs that were originally issued on Edison cylinders to be played on his phonograph: the three Polk Miller songs (Old Time Religion, Bonnie Blue Flag, and Watermelon Party) and the Ada Jones and Billy Murray duet (Shine On, Harvest Moon).  Polk Miller's Old South Quartette is remarkable by being one of the earliest integrated music groups. They toured extensively, but only ever made one recording session to make cylinders. Every song they ever recorded was made on one day in November 13, 1909. Their cylinders were so popular that they were frequently reissued on ""wax"" Amberol cylinders and celluloid and plaster Blue Amberols.  Mark Twain particularly loved the group as  “the only thing the country can furnish that is originally and utterly American.” He called ""Watermelon Party"" a ""musical earthquake"".  Ada Jones and Billy Murray (not to be confused with Bill Murray) were each recording superstars, performing comedic routines. Murray can be heard in the 2010 BioShock Infinite Debut Trailer on the gramophone singing “You’re a Grand Old Rag (Flag)” when the theme was still American Exceptionalism.  Most of the time it sounds like the performers are shouting into the speaking horn; that's because they were. Sound was acoustically recorded without the benefit of electrical amplifying microphones. So you have to adopt a certain stilted voice or only use certain instruments to be heard better over the background noise. Compare this ""Shine On, Harvest Moon"" with a 1955 big band arrangement with The Four Aces."

gaming,3e2luo,Goberth,5,Tue Jul 21 14:11:51 2015 UTC,"Emulating hardware in software will ALWAYS be less efficient. Just look at the crap we went through in the late 90's with Winmodems. When you have to carve out a chunk of your CPU and memory to produce what was previously done on a purpose built die/icu it is going to be slower no matter how many clock cycles you throw at it. The underlying OS is going to lose resources to get it's basic HAL stuff done and run your CPU to 100% just trying to perform the basic tasks of creating a basic VM of the underlying architecture it is simulating. You have to keep in mind, it is not just running that old game, but creating an entire virtual machine and all of the associated resources of the console that it was originally running on. tl:dr you are creating an entire PS2/PS3/Xbox/360 on your CPU and then still have to have enough headroom to actually run the game on it."
gaming,3e2luo,E1M1MID,5,Tue Jul 21 16:19:10 2015 UTC,this isn't a backwards compatible game - this is a full retail x1/ps4 native title. I dont think the PS4 version is using any ps3 emulation either.

gaming,3e2luo,on_with_disease,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:12:50 2015 UTC,ELI5: Why are outdated console games possessing graphics better than current gen remakes?
gaming,3e2luo,Thelastterminator,2,Tue Jul 21 15:33:27 2015 UTC,they did not do a good job porting the original code to the new hardware - simple as that.
gaming,3e2luo,Nose-Nuggets,-20,Tue Jul 21 17:33:24 2015 UTC,Current consoles are weaker than previous gen at a core level and are essentially weak PC's. Porting old games (which were tuned specifically for those old consoles) is always a crapshoot and requires a lot of engineering work to recover from the inefficiencies being introduced.  The Last of Us (which was PS3 exclusive) was in bad shape when it was initially ported - but Naughty Dog has excellent engineers. They rewrote the core scheduling piece of the game to take advantage of PS4's 8 cores more efficiently and were able to hit the 60 fps target at 1080p they were targeting.  Lazy ports are always going to struggle since they weren't optimized for the current gen game and most studios don't have the expertise or budget to spend time fixing the problems.
gaming,3e2luo,heat_forever,11,Tue Jul 21 15:41:42 2015 UTC,Current consoles are not weaker than previous consoles. The game was simply built for a different piece of hardware and thus needs more work to run smoothly on current gen then simply copy and pasting code.
gaming,3e2luo,johnnydarko,0,Tue Jul 21 16:09:04 2015 UTC,The PS3 was also built on super weird hardware that was notoriously difficult to develop for.  The PS4 is built on much more standard hardware.
gaming,3e2luo,durpfursh,-5,Tue Jul 21 16:50:49 2015 UTC,"At a core level, the individial chips are weaker - it's just that there's 8 of them instead of 3. Old Xbox 360 games were coded to expect 3 cores, so they don't take advantage of the additional cores. At least not without some effort to recode the game (like they did with The Last of Us from PS3 to PS4)."

gaming,3e2luo,hypnobearcoup,-3,Tue Jul 21 18:31:13 2015 UTC,"I should clarify, the older consoles had fewer but more powerful chips. The new consoles have slightly weaker but more cores. They also enable/disable chips based on what you're doing to conserve power.  This generation of consoles are a major disappointment as they were designed to be profitable out of the box, unlike previous generation where you got an extremely powerful system that was sold at a loss and recovered with game purchases."
gaming,3e2luo,heat_forever,5,Tue Jul 21 17:35:13 2015 UTC,"You're clueless. There's more to the system than just cpu cores and clock speed. You are ignoring memory bandwidth, gpu cuda cores, bandwidth, clock speed, etc.  Just absolutely clueless."

Either that or you could do another type of challenge where you seem how many tiers deep into doom in doom you can get then you play and beat each tier recursively outwards.

gaming,3dye10,Mr_Delusive,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:54:52 2015 UTC,"Depends. If the way the mod works is that the original program calls the second program as a nested function, it's probably at the 30 FPS lock. However.... if the mod is merely the TV + the ""shortcut"" (so to speak) ... then you have a very interesting solution with a frame (the original game) at 30 FPS, and a video at 60 (much like watching say, VLC in windowed mode - inb4 not at 60).

gaming,3e0307,KhevaKins,7,Tue Jul 21 09:29:19 2015 UTC,"I guess it really depends on what you are used to. In US more of the people are not used to subtitles because they don't need them except for foreign language and when the speech is inaudible.  This has the side effect that some people just can't watch a movie with subtitles because it distracts them.  I'm from a country where everything is subtitled and almost nothing apart from some children shows and movies are dubbed. So I'm used to subtitles. I don't use subtitles in my native language anymore, I use them as english just for the reason you said. If I miss something someone said I can still read from subtitle that what they said. But subtitles don't distract me at all and I can focus on both movie and subtitles really well.  Edit: I'm not saying that everyone from US can't watch a movie with subtitles on though."

gaming,3e0307,Onionsteak,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:42:47 2015 UTC,"It would be nice if developers started having separate subtitle options for cutscenes and actual gameplay. I can understand not wanting subtitles when you are watching a cutscene, but it is fairly necessary to have them turned on when you are actually playing the game, considering how stuff can get drowned out by your actions or randomness in the game.  I know a lot of people have the issue, which I also sometimes suffer from, where you just can't help but look at the subtitles even though you can perfectly hear what is being said. The distraction comes from being compelled to read the words on screen even when you don't need to."
gaming,3e0307,MNico,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:54:03 2015 UTC,Well it's kinda weird for me. English isn't my first language so subtitles help a lot and aren't really distracting. But when there are subtitles in my own language to things that are said in english I tend to have a harder time understanding it. I guess I'm processing the things they say in my head and the subtitles may be worded differently than what I was thinking of so I sometimes get slowed down because of them.
gaming,3e0307,Dman20111,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:26:45 2015 UTC,I think it's about non-native English speakers and native English speakers. Non-native English speakers are used to reading subtitles and don't even notice reading subtitles.
gaming,3e0307,chumppi,-2,Tue Jul 21 15:53:47 2015 UTC,"OTOH, having them off forces you to pay closer attention to the game/world itself, especially if the NPCs are relatively well-acted.  Subtitles take the player's attention away from everything except the text at the bottom of the screen.  Besides, honestly, if the sound isn't mixed well enough that the player can clearly hear the dialogue, that is a problem by itself and shouldn't need subtitles as a bandaid."
gaming,3e0307,APeacefulWarrior,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:06:19 2015 UTC,"That's assuming game sound alone is the only factor in whether or not the player can hear, and for most people it's not.

The profits that you get from any print or product is so marginally small because you're sharing your profits with this big company. There's taking a nice big slice of the pie, meanwhile you're  stuck with the short end of the stick. Not only that, but unless you're a super popular artist, no one will find you. They only cater to the super popular ones and make the unknown artists impossible to find. I simply find it very unfair."

Here are some other things you can do in this game or you didn't know about this game:   Spin jump on explosions. Make the music in the very last level of Special World go extremely fast by making Yoshi eat the green berries each time the timer goes under 100. I think you can kill Bowser's giant balls during the boss with this cape trick. You can get a goal point question sphere in your reserve box by performing a trick with Yoshi, a berry, and Charging Chuck. You can drop it in any level and it will beat the level. If the goal point is too high up on the screen, you can change the game's color palette to some epileptic seizure-causing mess. The color of the warp pipes depend on the ""screen"" they're on. You can mess up their colors on vertical levels."

If randomness and bullshit were as large a factor as the players argue it is then the same pros wouldn't dominate the scene so much. Yet they do. They consistently win.  It's easier to blame the game than it is to accept you could be doing something better and to improve. They don't get beaten by the bullshit all the casual players complain about...  I am more inclined to believe it's like Counter Strike, players have good and bad days, sometimes you can hit headshots all day everyday, sometimes you have a week of playing like trash. People are on form and people are off form all the time. In CS they don't blame it on the game though mostly, whereas in fifa players seem obsessed with finding excuses rather than learning from their errors.   No johns."

Those assists add an element of chance that doesn't exist if you switch them off. I'm pretty mediocre at the game and when I'm attacking, there are time I make a pass and the AI is abysmal, choosing the wrong player and playing a short ball even when I clearly added power for it to go further. This happens because I need the AI passing assistance, it may screw me over once or twice a game, but without it I'll screw up myself a whole lot more. I don't follow the truly competitive scene enough to know but I assume the best players turn everything off and play the game much more manually, thus increasing the skill ceiling and removing a lot of the chance.  So technically a lot of the people complaining are correct, it's just that many of the problems are the systems which exist to compensate for a lack of fine player skill. If they practiced and turned those off, I'm willing to bet a lot of complaints would disappear to some extent, at least in multiplayer."
gaming,3dxmpc,codeswinwars,14,Mon Jul 20 15:43:50 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right and I'm so glad someone is talking about this. Case in point: 95% of through balls you play to your striker on the most perfect run through the most perfect passing lane will end up being WAY overshot and go straight to the opposing keeper. I think it's also because if the game behaved ""realistically"" in that sense, every match would end up with scorelines in the double digits, so they pretty much have to decide when you can and cannot score just to make it seem more reasonable. I'm no FIFA expert, but this does make the game incredibly frustrating because it's like, okay, it's fucking Phil Coutinho, there's no way he messes that pass up!"
gaming,3dxmpc,IsaacFelix,13,Mon Jul 20 16:41:42 2015 UTC,IIRC and the last time i watched. The fifa pros abuse a bunch of exploitive shit due to AI incompetance. Havnt watched in a whille though so it might have changed.
gaming,3dxmpc,StuPiNduS,11,Mon Jul 20 15:45:34 2015 UTC,"This is exactly correct. Most of the famous YouTubers and ""pros"" I've seen will often play with Real Madrid and teams of their likes and just L1+Triangle or abuse pace. A few are skillful and use skill moves.   It is really annoying though, even the normal FIFA players do the chip through ball which is fairly easy to defend but if someone is doing it consistently it gets annoying and Ronaldo will eventually get a chance to get behind you. I have never seen a pro hold possession and actually breakdown the defense of their opponent."

You can hit a pass with the exact same direction and power 5 times and get a different result each time. This assistance is random and can happen with any team.  The reason the great players are so great is because they can adapt to this. They find a way to win regardless of the environment, much like those that are successful in real sports."

gaming,3dxmpc,BlackDante,17,Mon Jul 20 14:51:02 2015 UTC,"This is why I've always preferred PES to FIFA.  FIFA has more of a black box feel, a pass / fail approach if you will. You shoot and the system decides whether it will be a goal or not and from there paints the trajectory of the ball. It's gotten better over the years but it's obvious they've kept it in for entertainment's sake. The game overall is tailored for more spectacular playing action, not realism.  PES feels a lot more sandboxy, there are issues of timing, positioning and player skill that dictate the direction, power and accuracy of the shot; from there if the shot happens to be on goal and the goalkeeper happens to be badly positioned or not good enough you will score. It is also a painfully unforgiving system which makes it frustrating for newcomers, since nobody wants to go 0-0 for 20 games straight, no matter if you're Barça or Watford. There are still plenty of problems in PES, especially with pass accuracy and the AI, but as a game it definitely feels more of a simulation than FIFA. Scoring feels like more of an accomplishment. The pace of the game (ball and player speed, contact physics) is more akin to a real game. FIFA is sped up by a good 10-20%, again for entertainment and gameplay's sake.  Both have their merits, but PES is the better simulation overall and personally it makes for a more enjoyable, albeit hard, game. It's like an F1 game, if it were a true simulation it would take you years to learn how to drive. You have to cut corners somewhere, but cut too many corners and you're playing Mario Kart (which is a fine game, but not a replacement for a simulation)."

Luckily that doesn't happen that often anymore since the game freezes before the match starts and gives us a DNF about 40% of the time.   Worthless piece of shit game.

gaming,3e33ch,Antbuf,7,Tue Jul 21 16:13:56 2015 UTC,"Flight sims are better served on a PC that is built with the sim in mind.  It would be tough to design one that's as in depth as Microsoft Flight Sim or X Plane, for the consoles.  It would have to be toned down graphics wise for it to be possible.  Add this to the difficulty of being able to immerse yourself into the sim on a console, and that limits the market a bit.  People that invest in peripherals for driving sims are tame in comparison to flight sim enthusiast.    Most people that will invest in a setup that would make the experience enjoyable would probably rather build a dedicated PC for it.  Especially when it comes to multiple monitors, joysticks, and other control panels.  Edit: There's also the structure of other features that would be restrictive.  A lot of users have multiple add ons that change the experience as a whole.  VATSIM is pretty largely used for Air Traffic Control sim that incorporates with those that are flying.    There are also more realistic planes such as ""Level D"" that require much more involvement to fly.  Some of these planes can fetch hundreds of dollars to fly."

The only way it could is for it to be extremely stripped down, not having any weather, clouds, or the like. I don't think enough people would want one, and that MS wouldn't make it. Diehard simulator fans will always go to PC and get joysticks, throttle, rudder pedals, and control panels."

Never did I think it could be so addicting to clean up every little spot of blood, every piece of broken glass, every bullet casing, until the whole area is freaking spotless. I only played the free one that came with Shadow Warrior (which I recommend playing if you like action shooters), but I spent like 4 hours finding every little bit until it was cleaned to perfection by myself. I ended up having to noclip because the physics freaked out and sent a giblet into the invisible ceiling and it left an invisible blood splatter I couldn't reach from the floor.    The only things that struck me as weird or annoying about the whole thing: Buckets of water only last for about 3-4 rinses of a mop before you're just making your mop bloody again, you can (and are expected to) incinerate buckets of water, and the physics get really really weird when you shove a bunch of things into one of the trash buckets and try to carry it to an incinerator."

gaming,3dxrak,neckbeardsarewin,12,Tue Jul 21 00:46:05 2015 UTC,"You should test them first and see how the coaster rates, if intensity is >10 no one will dare use it. To achieve this you need to make sure that the curves are larger and banked at higher speeds, this also applies to hills. An example would be the quad coaster at the bottom of OPs pic, where the initial hill is tall and the second one is almost as tall. This slows down the speed at the top of the hill avoiding the high amount of G's that gives a ride a too high intensity rating, while it gives alot of speed allowing a longer ride and increasing excitement rating. Next it doesn't go all the way down to ground before it curves, this makes the cars travel at a slower speed during the curves again avoiding the high G's. It just practice though, with experience you will learn how much speed you can send the cars through the curves and hills with. The graphs for G forces are also great tools in troubleshooting where the issues are."
gaming,3dxrak,Essjayc,18,Mon Jul 20 18:02:40 2015 UTC,"You should test them first and see how the coaster rates   Nope; gotta open it up untested. As long as it's untested, it's new and exciting, and everyone is willing to get on, pretty much no matter how expensive it is.   Better yet, you can tweak the settings, and make a really long queue, so that the line fills before the first run even happens, and you can be guaranteed to make your money back with the shittiest ride. Everyones going to hate it, but you still get their money anyways.  Once that first train comes in, it gets the rating, and now people won't queue. Oh well, wait till the poor saps who got in line early pay your insane rates, and the line is empty, and send it back to construction mode. Delete 1 section of track, rebuild that one section exactly as it was. Brand new untested ride! Everyone will want to get on! Set up that massive delay again, get everyone in line, then laugh as you reap fat wads of cash from the ignorant masses.  Ahh, days of my youth. What I wouldn't give to go back to that.

gaming,3dyuqc,Pixelated_Piracy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:56:42 2015 UTC,"What I like about the game is that a lot of these moments that make no sense when you're playing actually have a plot justification and make sense once you understand more about what's going on. I like that they didn't compromise the atmosphere of a hallucinatory nightmare by over explaining things. You can play through again and noticing all these little details that just seemed like random bits of oddness that are actually intentional.  SPOILER ALERT TERRITORY -   The standard ""haunted"" enemies are all people whose senses of will and self-consciousness have been crushed by Ruvik. Ruvik was horribly burned in a fire that killed his sister so fire is a psychological weakness for him. Since the enemies are psycholigically linked to Ruvik they take on his weakness to fire.  Ruvik's research was stolen from him. He kept it within a safe, the same kind of safe that The Keepers have for heads. Ruvik's feelings of weakness and violation about having his research stolen manifests itself by having the safe not only protect Ruvik's secrets by storing them but by relentlessly trapping and hunting down anyone who might be a threat to Ruvik and torturing them.  I like that all these unrealistic things still conform to a sense of internal logic and have backstories that aren't explicitly stated. Gives the game a Dark Souls vibe. There are definitely silly moments in the plot, but it's definitely a huge step in mature storytelling for Shinji Mikami that leverages the advantages of video games are a storytelling medium."

I definitely check to be sure that I'm not painting over something famous (I should be so lucky to find a famous painting in a thrift store though).  Also, I do *try to stick to reproductions (vs. actual paintings) - those things you find reproduced on board, but I'll certainly make exceptions for mass produced hotel art (like this one).  I also have a number of unaltered originals that I won't paint into simply because they're too nice and the original artist wasn't just mass producing them for hotel walls :)  Point being, I try to be respectful."

In 2001, staff of the London's Eyestorm Gallery trashed an exhibit by Damien Hirst which appeared as a pile of beer bottles, ashtrays and coffee cups. In 2004, an employee of Tate Britain disposed of what appeared as a plastic bag of trash sitting next to an artwork; the bag was part of an exhibition ""Recreation of First Public Demonstration of Auto-Destructive Art"" by Gustav Metzger.[17] In 2012, an employee of Glenn Beck scrubbed clean a fish bowl that had been painted and signed by Orson Welles in 1940. The bowl had arrived from an auction that day and was left on Beck's desk in his locked office. [18] In 2014, a cleaning lady of Italian city of Bari threw away several artworks displayed in the context of an art show curated by Flip Project space, hosted in Sala Murat. [19]"

gaming,3dwelg,SpookBus,17,Mon Jul 20 11:38:44 2015 UTC,"So this one guy (this was in 98 or 99 I think) decided it would be an AWESOME idea to create an art work that was...a chicken coop.  Like, a nice rustic chicken hut.  In the middle of the gallery space (to be fair, this was an area set aside for ""experimental"" and performance art, but still).  With live chickens.  What he didn't reckon with is that he was coming from an EU country (Germany?) and Switzerland is not EU.  So he had to go through all kinds of formalities to import live animals.  So the animals didn't get imported.  A bunch died, the rest were impounded at the border.  I don't know what happened with them.  Then he figured, he'd go to a bunch of local farmers and buy chickens off them.  Voilà, chickens in the chicken coop.  Except that what he also didn't seem to consider is that chickens need feeding and their coops need cleaning.  So now you have a bunch of chickens running around, making ungodly noise, shitting all over the place, stressed like crazy from all the art lovers coming to gawk at them (and the chaos from all the various video / sound / light installations from other artists around them) and nobody taking care of them - particularly when the show closed in the evenings.  So now you have a huge amount of chicken shit and feathers, and a lot of dead chickens.  It was not pretty.  I don't know what happened after that; I was fortunate to only walk through there on the second day or so (out of about a week).    Moral of the story:  live chickens do not make good art.  Rather, if you're going to go with a chicken theme, well, you know what to do (NSFW).  Don't forget the black modesty bars, though."

gaming,3dygae,JiveAssCracker,71,Mon Jul 20 19:05:34 2015 UTC,"Personally I'd like to see what they do with an overhaul, hitting 'Attack' in the original FFVII over and over and over wasn't all that great combat."
gaming,3dygae,pipboy_warrior,27,Mon Jul 20 19:08:10 2015 UTC,"What made it fun for me was the preparation that went into combat rather than the combat itself. Hitting 'Attack' was fun because I put time into obtaining and leveling that 4x Attack materia or Slash-All or maybe I didn't use attack because I threw all my magic materia onto one person. Seeing the results of my planning/leveling/preparation is what I enjoy in turn based combat. Action removes that in a way that sounds great but sometimes actually ends up kind of boring. When your personal reflexes and skill come into play, it can lessen the importance of those numbers you spend so much time improving.  I mean I'm not going to make any sort of judgment without any information so it's moot anyway, but both systems have their charms. I think it's kind of silly to completely dismiss turn based but we'll see."
gaming,3dygae,misterwuggle69sofine,33,Mon Jul 20 19:44:26 2015 UTC,"Isn't this basically grinding, though? Admittedly that's a huge reason why I often play RPGs, but that's less a praise of the combat and more praising the skinner box that makes me feel good for getting higher and higher numbers.  I just think that FFVII's combat wasn't without it's flaws and can be improved upon.  If I'm going to fight hundreds of battles I'd rather there be some immersion to them.  I think FF X did a competent job at this, where at least you had to put some thought into who was attacking what."
gaming,3dygae,pipboy_warrior,5,Mon Jul 20 19:51:45 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah grinding is absolutely a part of it either way. What it comes down to for me I think is that my grinding meant something and it felt more fulfilling in a turn based system. When your own skill and reflexes can't be relied upon, you have to make the numbers work in your favor either by being clever with your loadouts/planning or by grinding. This still exists in action combat of course but in some cases you can just completely nullify all that extra stuff and ""cheese"" it just by being good at the game. In a lot of cases you have to intentionally nerf your own numbers in an action game in order for it to be a challenge if your reflexes are good enough. Like I said it SOUNDS great, but sometimes I just want to win a math fight in an RPG.   What really concerns me is that I think it's plenty possible to take advantage of today's technology in order to make a more interesting and improved turn based system, but they'd rather just scrap it and go action (at least presumably--again we don't know what the end result is going to look like so I'm not torn up about it one way or another)."
gaming,3dygae,misterwuggle69sofine,3,Mon Jul 20 22:12:54 2015 UTC,One really beautiful thing about FFVII was that it had a gaming scene dedicated to challenge playthroughs. The most popular were low level and no materia or some combination of the two. It's totally possible to beat the game under lvl 20.
gaming,3dygae,ansmo,11,Mon Jul 20 23:17:10 2015 UTC,and can be improved upon.   I dont want that. I want new graphics for an old classic. I simply want a palatable version of FF7 since the graphics for FF7 are a type that age like irish people tan.

gaming,3dygae,Skellum,4,Mon Jul 20 21:05:34 2015 UTC,They've said they wanna keep the more lighthearted moments so I'm sure they'll keep the stuff you said or at least heavily reference it or make fun of it.   They just said they don't like the idea of realistic characters lining up taking turns fighting. So it'll probably be a free movement system (like FFXIII) with FFVII combat.

gaming,3dygae,Skellum,2,Mon Jul 20 21:46:44 2015 UTC,"I do want that, as I see both the graphics and the gameplay as aged.  Unless SquareEnix gives options for multiple types of gameplay, they won't be able to please everybody all the time."
gaming,3dygae,pipboy_warrior,2,Mon Jul 20 20:56:48 2015 UTC,"My thoughts on that are that the graphics are simply the trappings for a game, that a game is more plot, and systems while UI is the superfluous addition. I look at things more for a developer standpoint and see the UI as something you use to pretty a good product up.   I wouldnt want to see FF7 in anyway an action RPG. I wouldnt want to see you controlling 1 party member and doing flipping derp attacks by mashing X and Triangle. If you wanted to change combat I'd like to see it more difficult, more dependent on ensuring your materia are properly chosen and ensuring you're leveling them correctly to make the system work.  The materia slotting puzzle should ensure the game smoothly translates to victories by your move choices. I also dont want to see them make the Midgar Zolom into fucking cut scene and I want to see new players to the game die to it repeatedly until they read."
gaming,3dygae,Skellum,3,Mon Jul 20 21:04:11 2015 UTC,"I think most gamers see games being more about gameplay.  Plots are important to RPGs but if that's all that video games were, then they'd serve the same purpose as books.  I see video game RPGs as marriage of several components: Writing, gameplay, sound, and visuals.   wouldnt want to see you controlling 1 party member and doing flipping derp attacks by mashing X and Triangle.    FFVII was an example of controlling 3 party member and mashing the X button over and over.  If anything Square has moved away from button mashing by making the obviously dumb fights automatic, while focusing more on serious fights where you have to pay attention to who's doing what. I put more thought into FF XIII and FFXIII-2 than I ever did with previous Final Fantasy games since Paradigm shifts became essential in those games.  That said I'm open to many different ways of doing combat, I'll wait and see what system Square comes up with.

Maybe it will be something with more action, maybe it will be turnbased but changed to require more player input, maybe it will be something we haven't thought of.   Agreed. I said somewhere else in this thread that there are a ton of things they can do to make me completely unwilling to pay for this game. The removal of cross dressing and swearing as dumb as it is would piss me off. I could be ok with Cait Sith being useful but overall there's a lot of very questionable variables for the game.  I think my big gripe with updating the combat is that I simply want a pretty FF7. No changes to anything else and expanding the scope of the project to include combat means they throw other things on the table as well."

It was the best. 13's was stupid as fuck, flashy for absolutely no reason, it made no sense, and was the epitome of ""button mashing"" because your character automatically did the best thing."

Remove anything from it and you removing little bits of other peoples enjoyment and what made the game unique to them. That being said it will not surprise me at all if they utterly ruin the remake for the people who played the original when it was released.
gaming,3dygae,sick__and__tired,2,Tue Jul 21 01:29:05 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I would personally love to see a KHII style battle system in the FFVII remake. However, I think it'd be cool if Square made it so you could switch between the battle systems, like you could choose between the original soundtrack and the redone soundtrack in the FFX remake."
gaming,3dygae,SpyroTheFabulous,0,Tue Jul 21 03:21:15 2015 UTC,"For people that want nothing but the original game, why don't those people simply play the original game?  I feel like the meaning of remake is somewhat being lost on people, if you want nothing changed then there's no point in there being a remake."
gaming,3dygae,pipboy_warrior,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:11:03 2015 UTC,What about just a graphical overhaul with some stuff extra content instead of remaking the fighting system? Why do remakes have to take a really great IP scoop out the heart and soul of what made the game great to begin with and replace it all with everything that is bad about modern gaming? When FF7 first came out game developers were more bold and daring with the content they made. Today its entirely too formulaic. Why do we have to continue in the same direction the newer final fantasies are with the fighting system? A remake that had the old fighting system intact would be a great game and would allow a younger generation to experience what the original game was like without being repulsed by the low quality of graphics in it.
gaming,3dygae,sick__and__tired,0,Tue Jul 21 03:25:10 2015 UTC,"The graphics are just as much a part of the charm as anything else for the original.  You can't claim that everything's sacred and nothing can be touched except for that one thing you want to be touched.  Seriously, if the original is so great and you want nothing changed, then why not just ignore the remake and play the original?  If they're going to make any kind of effort into a remake they might as well look at everything.   When FF7 first came out game developers were more bold and daring with the content they made.    FF7's combat system wasn't bold or daring, it was a by the book Fight-Magic-Item-Run system.  The materia system was what made FF7 different, and that was largely borrowing from FF6's Esper system of learning magic and just applying that to skills as well.  I've played plenty of turnbased RPG's that have been similar to FFVII's.  And younger generations are just as likely to be repulsed by a system that largely comes down to mashing X over and over and over for the majority of fights, you have to look past your nostalgia and see the system for what it was."

It's not to say that the game couldn't be improved it's just that the company you're asking to improve the game aren't capable (in the opinion on many longterm fans of VII) of making something that can deliver an acceptable gaming experience.  The more they deviate the more they're going to fuck it up, the game simply needs added content ie: flesh out more sidequests, add some more places, characters and depth to the existing storyline, compeltely redone graphics and a remastered soundtrack.  If they turn it into a 3D kingdom hearts furry fanfic with XIII battle system MMO it's going to suck arse."
gaming,3dygae,King_Big_Dick,0,Tue Jul 21 13:32:34 2015 UTC,"No offense, but Square-Enix in their current state will undoubtedly wreck the game.   No offense, but if you feel that way then any remake made by them should be irrlevant to you in the first place, and you should stick with the original game.  You don't like the modern company and you're likely not going to give the remake a chance in the first place, so your opinion on what the game should or shouldn't do is rather irrelevant.   the game simply needs added content   You seem to have no faith in Square Enix, you'd just as likely be disappointed in that.  You don't like how they do their games now, best just keep on replaying the original game since that's how you want the game to be."
gaming,3dygae,pipboy_warrior,2,Tue Jul 21 13:37:44 2015 UTC,No offense but the remake is for people who are nostalgic of the FF7 universe. The combat system is a MASSIVE part of that universe.
gaming,3dygae,atriax,4,Tue Jul 21 04:16:36 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. FFVII is one of the most widely acclaimed games of all times, both by gamers and critics. The remake is a combination of capitalizing on the existing nostalgic fan base, as well as introducing new gamers who have never played the game before to it. Remaking a game naturally implies changes both big and small. Tetsuya Nomura himself said that the only way Square would do a remake would be if they could make the experience better as a whole than it was originally. Besides, there's always the ports of the originals if you want everything to be the same, it is coming to the PS4 as well, after all."
gaming,3dygae,SpyroTheFabulous,2,Tue Jul 21 04:31:21 2015 UTC,the original FFVII over and over and over wasn't all that great combat.   imo that combat was way better.  I want a turnbased Final fantasy game not an action based one :( but if they can make it action based and good like FFXIV combat then maybe...
gaming,3dygae,Ryulightorb,2,Mon Jul 20 23:47:13 2015 UTC,You can improve on turnbased without completely changing to action.  Why are people thinking I dislike turnbased? I dislike most fights coming down to spamming X over and over.

gaming,3dygae,Ryulightorb,2,Mon Jul 20 23:58:20 2015 UTC,I dislike spamming x over and over.   Higher in the comments section    I put more thought into 13 than any other ff game.   So hitting L1 > x > x > x > x >L1 > x > x >x is harder to you than scrolling through spells/summons/items/attacks manually? You're joking right? 13 was the definition of spam. Your characters literally did the best move for the situation every fucking time if you clicked auto. I never manually did a move in any of the 13 games.
gaming,3dygae,atriax,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:18:55 2015 UTC,"It's not what you did, it's the thought process that goes into your moves, which got removed from Final Fantasy over time and that's why it sucks to me now."

Somehow that is better for some people and that's what FF7 Remake will be."

But probably 95% of the combat was me using attack over and over and over, especially with random battles.  I haven't played FFXII or XV but I found XIII's battle system at least moderately engaging with how the Paradigm Switching played out."

gaming,3dygae,SpyroTheFabulous,2,Tue Jul 21 03:44:49 2015 UTC,KH2 boiled down to spamming quick times though. I absolutely loved those games but unless it was a boss battle it was rather dull. Most enemies were just an annoyance until you can hit triangle for the kill.

All they have to do is figure out why FFVII is better than FFXIII.  If they can't do that, then they are wasting money making games.    There's something awesome about FFVII and FFIX that they just haven't tried to recapture.

The reason modern Final Fantasy games haven't had the scope and freedom that the older games like FF7 had is because assets are so much more expensive to develop now.  Just because they're remaking a classic doesn't make those costs go away.  Especially with the company is poor financial shape, they're going to have to cut corners.  And it's just not realistic to expect them to understand how horrible of an idea dumbing down the scale of the game will be -- this is, after all, the same company that's been so deaf to what their customers want that they announced a non-updated version of FF7 last year and expected it to be wildly successful.   I hate to say it but this has disaster written all over it."

They did that by listening to the fans.

gaming,3dygae,Darkfire346,3,Mon Jul 20 23:38:58 2015 UTC,Well from just reading Reddit it seems like nobody can even agree on what they want from a VII remake. Do you want an overhaul of everything and a new perspective on the story or do you want a pixel for pixel update of the same game. It seems like it's going to take a might effort for it to be successful. I just hope it doesn't go the way of versus XIII and release in 2025.
gaming,3dygae,Fraugheny,3,Tue Jul 21 01:15:24 2015 UTC,"I'd take a version of the game with all the features it was supposed to have, but which were trimmed or not implemented correctly. Almost a dozen unused monsters, unused status effects, the complete lack of a Holy-element magic outside of one summon, Magic Defense literally not doing anything....

gaming,3dygae,ginger_beer_m,27,Tue Jul 21 01:30:06 2015 UTC,"This isn't really a surprise. Late 90s, early 00s was the heyday for Final Fantasy because they release FF7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and X-2 over a 6 year period.   FF12 was in development for 6 years because of all the problems it had during development,  FF13 was in development for 5, FF15 has been in development for 8 years and only got renamed recently because the real FF15 would probably not be out until 2022 at the rate they're doing.  With their flagship series taking so long to develop a new main title, it's no surprise they've had to fall back on handheld titles, recycled sequels and porting their older games about. It's not just Final Fantasy, but also Kingdom Hearts. I'm not going to pretend I understand the story any more, but handhelds, it's a lot easier than releasing new console games. They take so long to make something new, that people who loved the series back then have grown apart from it. I don't know much about Dragon Quest, but from what I can remember it's in the same state, with handheld games being done for Nintendo and console games being pretty far apart and also not giving huge releases elsewhere and on all consoles."
gaming,3dygae,Norn-Iron,9,Mon Jul 20 16:29:44 2015 UTC,"I'm starting to wonder if the graphically detailed Final Fantasy games they're trying to make are even viable at this point, with them investing so many years of development and trying to get the graphical quality so high.  FFXIII cost so much that it seems they released XIII-2 and XIII-3 to re-use assets and try and profit from that investment. However each sequel sold half as well or less than the previous entry, with XIII-3 only shifting 1 million units worldwide.  XV seems to have recaptured some hope with the promise of being a beautiful next gen Final Fantasy, but that's exactly what it looked like when they were marketing FFXIII before it came out.  I wouldn't be surprised to see XV-2 and XV-3 just to try and recoup their investment."
gaming,3dygae,fade_like_a_sigh,9,Mon Jul 20 18:56:49 2015 UTC,"I've thought for a long time that their biggest issue is that they develop a new engine for every single FF game.  Years of development time just go into that, without creating any actual assets.  Try and tell me that they couldn't have made FFXIII on Unreal or CryEngine.  You can't, because they could have done just that, for less time and money."
gaming,3dygae,PM_YOUR_BOOBS_PLS_,5,Mon Jul 20 20:20:28 2015 UTC,"Interestingly, I believe ""The Last Remnant"" was Unreal Engine 3.  They're not above using other people's engines I guess.  Though Last Remnant had some of the same issues that plagued other UE3 games, and only the PC version seemed to fully realize the game's options (the PS3 version never happened, despite being announced).

Really, Crysis, Unreal, etc. are just showcases for the engine, made to get others to buy in.  The engine is the final product, not the game.  On the other hand, Square spends half of a decade building each very specialized engine, that sees pretty much no use outside of the game it was built for.  The game is the final product, not the engine.  It works for UE and CryEngine.  It doesn't work for whatever Square has cooked up for their latest RPG."

A lot can be done with the unreal engine, any genre, in fact, but there's a difficulty curve, where it begins to look appealing to just write your own custom stuff if there isn't ""enough"" of it already built into unreal.  Square Enix has used it before. I'm sure they considered the possibility, and ultimately, making their own made more sense to them."

gaming,3dygae,LiterallyYawgmoth,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:05:36 2015 UTC,"I think the graphically detailed games they are making are viable, but success really depends on the original game. When you make a product, if a lot of people aren't really happy with it then they aren't likely to buy the sequel. If that sequel lso doesn't make people happy, even less will buy the next. That's what we saw with FF13 and each game selling less than before.   I think it may have just been developing for PS3 was just too costly or complicated for them to really care. I have read that Cell was quite a pain in the ass for game developers so it's possible Square decided to just write off last gen. Compared to PS2, the PS3 didn't have the same amount of big game titles being released and the timetables were all over the place, while the 360 was knocking out franchises like Gears of War, Mass Effect and Halo pretty consistently and doing a pretty damn good job of it.   I think in the end, FF15 will end up making all of it's money back and more. They'll just use 15-2 and 15-3 to squeeze more money out of gamers since FF16 is probably going to be years away since they'll pump out FF7 other games tied to it. I just hope they give 8 and 9 the same treatment."
gaming,3dygae,Norn-Iron,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:47:12 2015 UTC,"I hope 16 is a standalone.  I much prefer this strategy where they release sort of Gaiden games on the side, like Type-0. (Maybe next time doing it properly on console first, but certainly lower budget compared to the main games)  I wish they'd take another crack at a game like The Bouncer. They almost had that classic arcade brawler feel, but it just fell short. They were so close though, and it was so pretty. To this day it shocks me that it was pretty much a launch PS2 game."
gaming,3dygae,rolfraikou,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:44:37 2015 UTC,"I remember loving how much the styles in the games used to seem to alternate.  Some tried to look more realistic (FF8) there was a middle (FF7) and all cute super deformed (FF9)  FF10 came out, as what I perceived to be another ""realistic"" and that the next one would end up looking more cute. Well, they went with the browns and blue style that the director always does for FF12 (I don't count the online ones as main entries to a largely linear style of games series)  ... and now it all looks the same.  We need more style variance.  You know what would blow me away? If they teamed up with actual animation studios for each game.  Imagine a Gainex styled (Evangelion) style FF game. Imagine a Ghibli style FF game.  A good example, look at how distinct the Dragon Warrior/Quest series looks!  It just oozes Akira Toriyama, and I think that is so cool.  Persona also has a very distinct flavor.  Hell, look at Kingdom Hearts!!!! The same designer as Final Fantasy, but they just actually represented his style better in those games (IMO, it matches his concept art far more than the Final Fantasy games ever have.)  I know some people will read this and think ""Well, they want to appeal to Western audiences.""  Final Fantasy still screams JRPG. I feel like a majority of their fanbase, it's not a western series, and the more western they have tried to be, the less I have liked them.  Give me giant swords, omega-ultra-giga-lasers, and cactuar.  In many ways doing a more anime inspired graphical look also makes details in texturing/material creation a lot less intense. You're not worrying about as many real-world properties. Instead of doing tons and tons of math and feeling uninspired, you do a little bit of math and be creative with it.  EDIT: I have some more thoughts to add to this topic as well. They don't have much money right now, but that is probably partially because they invested so much in the future, and their upcoming games will be cheaper for it.  They revamped the MMO, fixing it, and are seeing steady growth. A huge upfront cost, but with longterm gains.  They also spent tons of money on making the Luminance(sp) engine. Now, the upfront cost of making such an over-the-top engine was very very high, it was their most ambitious engine ever...but now for the next few years, all their games are going to be made on one of two premade engines (that or Unreal) meaning that those games will be cheaper to make compared to if they had to retweak or rewrite engines for every game. They made a swiss-army knife, rather than modifying their tools constantly, as they used to.  Disney did this as well. Tangled had a massive massive production budget, and people have often said ""Why? It was good, but not that great.""   The tech they used on that film directly made production of every Disney animated film after that easier and cheaper. It allowed them to focus on the creative aspect more, leading them to a number of big cash-cows, particularly Frozen.  It just seems easier to blow a ton of cash on the technical shit all at once, then later benefit from being to focus on the creative process, without as much hindrance from the technical aspects."

gaming,3dygae,Kiita-Ninetails,2,Mon Jul 20 21:33:57 2015 UTC,FF13 was actually critically accepted but people on the internet would have you believe otherwise. Ff12 received the exact same backlash that FF13 did when it was first released. People don't remember though because FF13 is the new whipping boy.
gaming,3dygae,DiluvialAscension,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:28:39 2015 UTC,"...Not really. You can see the difference on metacritic.   12 is tied for the second highest, with 92. XIII has 83, or if you talk PC version, a whopping 65.  So while some people had issues with 12, overall it was tied with ones like X and VII in terms of reception, at least on metacritic. Whearas 13 had some redeeming features, but was primarily garbage."
gaming,3dygae,Kiita-Ninetails,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:29:30 2015 UTC,"..Not really.   Yes really. while 83 isn't as high as 92, it's still a great score for any game, yet the internet would have you believe that FF13 is literally the spawn of Satan. No one looks at a game score of 83 and goes ""oh that game must be shit, I'm not playing it"". But that's all beside the point.  All you're looking at is the critic scores. Now look at the user scores and FF13 and 12 has virtually the same score. Like I said, both games were critically accepted but user opinion was far different."
gaming,3dygae,DiluvialAscension,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:49:05 2015 UTC,"Actually, yes the user opinion WAS far different. But not in the fashion you imply.   First, they are 7.8 and 7.5, respectively. But the difference in how these scores are achieved is very key here. (And is something to keep in mind with metacritic.)  While the score is the same if you look closely you notice that the reasons for this are much simpler than they would appear. despite similar positive review totals, XIII has vastly more overwhelmingly negative reviews than XII did. And XII has many posative, but low-end of the posative reviews. Which indicate a game that was good, but has issues.   In the case of XIII there is an awfully suspicious amount of 10/10's propping its score up, which strikes me as a bit fishy.  (And for context btw X is 8.8, which I feel is pretty merited despite tidus being terrible, since he is literally just distilled daddy issues. And VII is 9.2, which I feel has a bit of nonstalgia goggles talking, it was amazing at the time but it has kind of aged poorly, at least last time I played it.)"
gaming,3dygae,Kiita-Ninetails,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:08:39 2015 UTC,"Actually, yes the user opinion WAS far different.   No it wasn't. Look at metacritic. Virtually the same. And the response was the same if you actually frequented the internet when the game was released. It was bashed relentlessly. It's only all these years later that the game is starting to receive praise. Like I said, FF13 is the new whipping boy. Just watch in 10 years, the tune sung about FF13 will not be what is being sung now. It's the same cycle that happens over and over again.   In the case of XIII there is an awfully suspicious amount of 10/10's propping its score up, which strikes me as a bit fishy.   Ahh good ol confirmation bias. It wouldn't be an FF discussion without it. I would imagine there are countless amount of 0/10 reviews by people trolling and being general idiots as well. But lets ignore that and just pretend there are a fishy amount of 10/10 reviews and everything else is legit because you disagree with what I say."
gaming,3dygae,DiluvialAscension,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:09:04 2015 UTC,"I did, I read through about 150 of both at random  And the reaction is different, for one. First and foremost, the sample size for 13 on metacritic is much much larger with 2212 reviews, compared to the 786 of 12.   And as I said this is throwing the score a bit since the majority of the critical reviews for 13 are getting drowned out by a very large amounts of 10-9/10's In comparison even preportionally 12 gets into actual reviews far faster than 13 instead of just trolling. (Since realistically any 10/10 9/10 is kind of trolling for both, they may have had their good point but like all final fantasy games they were not perfect) So a larger percentage of the reviews actually adress the issues that 12 had. (Which is good, since that is the whole point of the reviews)  And the criticism may be a tad similar (Rightly in some cases) like some of the chars being shit. In 12 we had an issue with Vaan and Panelo being glaringly shit compared to literally every other char in the game. In 13 the chars were just fairly weak overall.   And of course, you have the people that give 0/10 just because its not whatever the previous FF they liked was. The people that basically go ""The combat is different, 0/10""   But for the most part I found I was hitting more reviews that actually reviewed the game for 12, and less for 13.  Ultimately neither was perfect, but it is hard to argue that 13 was realistically better aside from graphics and potentailly combat. (Though I would add that no FF game is near perfect, VII and the other older titles have aged relatively badly, at least in my experience X had its own issues with weak chars... etc. But then again I do not think I would give any game in the history of gaming a perfect score)"
gaming,3dygae,Kiita-Ninetails,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:23:21 2015 UTC,And the reaction is different   That's not what you said. You said the reaction was FAR different. It's not. It's about .3% of a difference. That is why there are less mixed and negative reviews for FF12. Because it's .3% higher in score than FF13.   but it is hard to argue that 13 was realistically better   Who argued this? I didn't. Seems like an irrelevant point.
gaming,3dygae,DiluvialAscension,2,Tue Jul 21 02:24:28 2015 UTC,"I guess it really depends who did the reviews. I know FF12 generally ranks high, but I find that FF7 is usually the one people think is best and if it's not top, it's FF6 instead. I must be doing something wrong as I really enjoyed 8 and 10, hell even X-2 and people are shocked that I'm not a Sephiroth or Cloud fanboy."
gaming,3dygae,Norn-Iron,2,Mon Jul 20 21:41:56 2015 UTC,"I find that 12 was oddly hit or miss. You either loved it or hated it from when I have commented. Personally I think it is the best final fantasy game by a huge margin. But a lot of other people I asked were turned off by some of the lackluster main chars. (Fuck you Vaan and Panelo, go die) or the odd semi-interactive combat (That I personally quite liked)  But personally I found that what 12 did so much better than the others is actually something most people do not consider... secondary cast. All of the secondary chars like Vayne, Larsa, Ondore, Gabranth, Cid ETC were all amazing in that game and it just made the world so much more alive. (Though technically Vayne is the antagonist, but hey)"

It's consistent money, but at the same time it's a long time to wait compared to profits made from the 5-6 million gamers worldwide buying a console game for $60 during the first year. I think FFX-2 was done in part because of the amount of players who wouldn't be playing FF11 so X-2 was a quick, cheap and simple solution that sold over 4 million copies. That's a lot of money.   I haven't put a lot of time into FF14 (I found the combat system to be really slow) but I keep hearing good things and I am sure it will be a source of money for them (even after the scraping and rebuild) so it's not likely to hurt them, but it's not going them much favours either.

FF8s biggest issue was shitty system, the plot is contentious but it's draw system was fucking retarded.   FF13 and all it's spawns had terrible systems, unlikable characters, and a god awful plot, and level design, I keep adding things because just the staggering shit of everything not graphical was painful.  I feel if they made good underlying systems then people would like the games, at least get 2/3 facets too the game. I also have to wonder if having bishonen as every male character is even worth it.

I didn't get any real pleasure from FF7 at all because everyone had already played it and were spoiling the game left, right and centre. It took a lot of motivation out of playing.   I'm not really sure the bishonen thing is really holding the games back, but things like ""Lets make a female Cloud""  does. It's great they do as much different as possible, but if they keep trying to recycle the same lead, then it can be a put off. Even the main character in FF15 is one hair dye away from looking like Cloud.

gaming,3dygae,the_dharma_bum,2,Mon Jul 20 23:35:13 2015 UTC,"This information seem to be outdated.  Looking at Google Finance, Square Enix was at around 1,850 Yen per share a few days after the merger on April 4th. Google Finance unfortunately don't provide such detailed data for something that long ago.  Now it's worth 3,185 yen per share. That's 72.2% growth over the 12 years or so. Over the same period of time, inflation was ~30%. That's means if you had bought Square Enix right after the merger, you'd have beaten inflation by about 40%. That's not too horrible. While I'm sure it didn't outperform the rest of the market, it doesn't mean it's worth less than the merger time.  Back at the beginning of 2014, it was true that Square Enix was fairly low valued, but that's certainly not the case now."

gaming,3dygae,revenantae,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:36:42 2015 UTC,"You know, every time I hear that a major game publisher is struggling, I always wonder why they don't focus a lot of their efforts into creating a great new (action-oriented) shooter franchise. They sell like hotcakes and are the main IP of multiple major publishers. Microsoft has Halo, Activision has Call of Duty and now Destiny, EA has Battlefield, 2K/Take-Two has Borderlands, and Sony had Killzone and Resistance, but they still have Uncharted.  And I suppose even Ubisoft has their various smaller shooter franchises, such as Far Cry, Ghost Recon, and Rainbow Six. And all of those were only given new life as recently as 2012, with RS being revived just this year.  Square Enix could even make a sub-par game and it still might make them a good bit of money. Bethesda had back-to-back disappointments with RAGE and Brink in the same year, but I believe both games managed to sell over three million copies each.  Just the hype alone helps a ton. Homefront also managed to sell about that much, and if it had actually lived up to its hype, it very well might have been able to keep THQ from going under.  So, if they have the money, they should put it into creating an awesome new shooter franchise. And if they succeed, they can then move on to something else that is incredibly popular, like a MOBA or something. In time, that those kinds of games could end up helping the company a whole hell of a lot, probably becoming their main source of revenue."

gaming,3dygae,GeminiK,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:20:17 2015 UTC,"Interesting title, problem is according to a quick Google is not actually true. On July 19th of 2001 (2 Weeks after spirits within was released according to Wikipedia) the stock price was 2890. You can see this by googling ""square enix stock price"" and then hitting max on the graph that appears, mouse over the line for details. Hell even if we take the couple of days before it was out (June 29th) it was 2140 so only slightly lower then.... but still not ""worth less than it is today"".  The current stock price is 3170. I don't see any evidence of any stock withdrawals (as in stock not being sold any more, there is probably an official term, no idea what it is) so currently its looking like NeoGAF might be exaggerating the situation somewhat. There was mention of stock splits with relation to subsidiary but that increases the amount of stock out there I think, meaning the company would actually be worth more now even if the stock price was the same (Apple did this recently)  I wouldn't take the word of a ""hardcore gaming site"" about the finances surrounding the industry, they have been known to a bit a fanboy like over there and have a habit of believing without evidence."

The wheelchair will fly over to you and can kill you.) Wait a week during the actual fight. Have a true sniper duel. Pro tip: killing his parakeet will piss him off but supposedly make it harder to track you. Sneak around behind him and hold him up (this is how you get Moss camo)."

The boyfriend and I didn't have much common ground, but he had played this game over and over, completed it with every character and new most of the secrets.  He and I played it all weekend long.

gaming,3dxwdd,Darksoulz4dayz,8,Mon Jul 20 19:16:36 2015 UTC,"I was thinking that the mansion boss was a were wolf.  What I remember most about all of that was that we ad a team meeting on some level design.  Someone voiced the opinion that the boss would have a flat panel monitor on his computer.  Since staring at screens was like, 95% of most of the teams lives the meeting erupted in chaos about what time of monitor the boss should have.  An hour of time and there was no consensus about it and with all the programming, art, and design time wasted, it probably cost the company around $3000.  Never got around to the big questions that needed answering.  I guess that's why the art lead made some questionable decisions unchecked like: Who the fuck wears jeans with one pant leg missing?"
gaming,3dxwdd,DarrenEdwards,2,Mon Jul 20 19:25:26 2015 UTC,Woah. $3000 wasted because no one could agree what would be on his monitor? That's pretty funny.

It would be tough playing through couch games like this online.  80% of the game was planning snack and drink breaks with your friends.  The other parts were complaining about taking lives away from your friends because of the shared life total.

Unfortunately I doubt a remake will happen. The biggest reason is that the setting no longer exists. It is part of what is called the oWoD (Original World of Darkness) or cWoD (classic World of Darkness). The setting was completely scrapped and rewritten. The new Hunter setting is entirely different.

I always made fun of the game until I actually played it. The next thing I knew, I was spending way to much time customizing my house,  clothes, etc. Then I met the default Sims in my neighborhood. This neighbor lady kept coming over to visit. I talked to her a bit, and I noticed the little hearts above their heads, so I kept doing stuff that would increase the relationship. The next thing I knew, the game had the neighbor lady move in with my female Sim.   Then a kid showed up. It was her daughter. The showed up for a bit. They would stay a while, then leave, while the neighbor lady stayed. I just imagined then showing up, begging her to come back home, then leaving, dejected. I actually felt a bit sad.   TL;DR: I was a lesbian home wrecker in the Sims."

gaming,3dw14t,phuckman69,19,Mon Jul 20 03:37:11 2015 UTC,One time while playing the Sims 3 I had my female sim take a shower before she had to go to her job. Her carpool came before she was done so I X'd off the command and she hopped out of the shower and ran to go to work. I noticed the clothes she put on were skin colored and didn't look like her normal work clothes but I didn't think much of it.   Then when she came home I realized she was but naked but with nothing pixelated out. She went to work naked. I almost fell out of my chair I was laughing so hard. Everything was there in all its glory. I think it was a glitch or something because it also messed up her face picture in the corner of my screen. It was blank until she changed into her pajamas to go to bed. The whole situation was so strange but hilarious.

A dude walks into the bathroom, pixelates his crotch, pulls down his pants, sits on the toilet, and proceeds to take a nice leisurely dump.   As soon as he pinches a gigantic deuce into the bowl, the toilet immediately clogs up and starts desperately advertising that it's dirty and needs to be plunged.   Of course that attracts the attention of the maid, who cheerfully wanders into the bathroom, then reaches around behind her to whip out a plunger from ""hammerspace"".  Then she helpfully thrusts the plunger into the toilet bowl through the still-squatting dude's pixelated crotch, with the long hard plunger handle sticking up at full attention, and starts vigorously jerking the handle up and down to unclog the toilet while the lucky dude was still sitting on the toilet!

I learned a lesson that day.

It just removes the possibility to enchant for better alchemy and smithing, and removes the possibility to brew potions that improve enchanting and smithing. Those effects are instead replaced with something new"

gaming,3dza8s,MASSIVE_OGRE_COCK,6,Tue Jul 21 14:19:07 2015 UTC,its like a WiiU with no first party support.  Nintendo can push their console with their own IPs to showcase the gameplay. 3rd party support is harder because the console isn't as strong as a ps4 and xbox1 and theres no secondary screen to emulate 3ds games.  So all games have to be made for this platform specifically. The only think it had was the PSP as it's legacy but it just wasn't enough because most of Sonys ressources went to push the PS4  IMO
gaming,3dza8s,BigPoulet,2,Mon Jul 20 23:52:57 2015 UTC,Lack of AAA games. It's mostly used as an indie machine now.

Really it's a great system with good games just no media coverage. I mean gravity rush alone is worth owning one alone.

gaming,3dza8s,shinjuki,2,Tue Jul 21 00:36:44 2015 UTC,"The games for it will be collectors items, more so than any other 'new' system. They are only on that system and don't sell a lot of them. So a lot of the JRPGs that you can't get anywhere else will be rising in price compared to most other games and systems these days that drop in price super fast.  The Vita is a good system and has good games. I personally like the Playstation TV to play vita since I usually do it for RPGs and would rather play them on a bigger screen and with a controller.  If you have a PS3 or PS4 controller getting a PSTV and Persona 4 is around $60. A steal IMO. Plus there are many other great games that are only on Vita."

There are times it's better to run away because it's not ""worth it"" to waste your precious ammo on some especially pugnacious mobs, but this is rare. Most are at least worth the XP or have pretty good loot.   The exceptions basically resemble the shitheeled Anklyos and stuff from Final Fantasy 1 in the desert, the ""hard to kill, low xp, 1 stupid gold"" type mobs. One type of ghoul is unreasonably hard to kill (doesn't even have guns either), several types of mutants (including one excessively tough and inefficient rat variant) and like, Fire Geckos under certain circumstances (arguably valuable, but they are somewhat dangerous, and hold you up, risking encounters with really dangerous player encounters and parties.

Though I'm pretty sure there were posters in some CP areas encouraging local officers to submit to augmentation as a form of career advancement.  Successful troops leave Nova Prospekt and become the human forces of the Combine on Earth. Washouts become the drones you see working in the citadel or get ground up into the nutrient paste they feed the citizens.  The Combine themselves are a shadowy group of aliens who subjugate worlds for labor/resources and act mostly through slave races and the various biotech you see on earth in the form of the striders, hunters, and gunships you fight in HL2. Their parent race is possibly the telekinetic grubs you see in the games, though these could also just be another slave race running the combine's forces on Earth."

gaming,3dwzh3,Slumlord722,2,Mon Jul 20 14:35:10 2015 UTC,I believe that CP officers receive certain privileges (such as simulated intercourse) for signing up.

Too much drop shadow.  Tone it down some, maybe set the distance to 2 or 3 pixels at 90 degrees (because the art has a vertical line theme), and no more than 2 or 3 in spread and size, then lighten by reducing opacity.  Design is pretty cool though, and I like the coloring."

Then betas became invite only/free for all. Then betas became something you got as an extra perk with a purchase of something else. Now people want you to pay money for Alphas. It's like a complete backwards progression.

gaming,3dv2kk,TheCatSnatch,13,Mon Jul 20 12:08:52 2015 UTC,"There are certainly companies that should not do it, but it does provide a single developer the means to create a game much quicker. Testing is one of the longest processes in software development.  The income also provides the developer with the means to spend more time making the game. Without that income, the game might take much longer to be released."
gaming,3dv2kk,syphon7,4,Mon Jul 20 05:37:21 2015 UTC,"Well, there's more complexity to it than that.  First, a lot of these are small low-budget studios who may flat-out need the early funding to actually make the game at all.  Early Access can be seen as a bit like Kickstarter in that way, at least in some cases.  Plus, like Syphon7 said, it slashes costs and dev times, since traditional QA is a long and expensive process.  And the other problem with free betas is that of trolls and other griefers.  Not just those deliberately exploiting bugs and not reporting them, but those who actively fuck with the process itself purely for the lulz.  Or troll other users to drive them away, etc etc.  Some will simply exploit the chaos of a beta for their own amusement.  Pay-for betas create a barrier to entry, as well as giving the players in them a sense of actual investment.  Very few are going to be so desperate to troll that they'll pony up $15 for the ability to submit false bug claims or whatever.  And those who do pay in are more likely to take the bugtesting seriously, and interact with devs on message boards, and soforth.  Now, that said, I do think that paid-for betas / Early Access really should offer more in recompensation for their beta-testers, like lifelong free DLC or something like that.  Either that, or price the beta significantly lower than the final game will cost.  Obviously, some already do this, but it DOES bother me when I see a game put into Early Access for what's clearly the exact same price it's going to retail for, and with no real bonuses at all.  I actually tend to suspect that market pressures will drive devs towards those sorts of things, given how many Early Access games are now competing for bored people's dollars.  Chances are, in a year or two, anyone who uses Early Access without offering decent incentives will be seen as money-grubbing."

gaming,3dv2kk,_Equinox_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:04:59 2015 UTC,"Haha, I get what you mean and I should have really emphasized the ""or more"" bit, but it's still true. Even if the immediate profit is the same, as you say - there'd be a lot more free publicity if a lot more people had the game because the game was a lot cheaper. This in turn encourages more business for the developers later, due to greater investments because the brand is more secure and likely to thrive later on.  Of course that relies on more people buying it because it's cheaper, it's never really that simple, although I'm willing to bet the price is putting a fair few people off considering the games appeal."

Not like 1 or 2 where you would walk by a vent, and a monster MIGHT pop out, literally every time you walked past a vent in 3 something came out... kinda ruined it for me because you could see it coming."
gaming,3dy4ec,CaptPeterWaffles,6,Mon Jul 20 20:54:35 2015 UTC,"I think some of the later levels in Dead Space did it better by reusing the early, cheap tactics. They stopped laying down and playing dead in the early levels, but did it a couple times again in later levels."
gaming,3dy4ec,Silver_Star,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:30:30 2015 UTC,The devs explained that they wanted it to be toned down horror wise to reach a wider audience. Sure its more action with a less adult rating but it removes what made the series good in the first place... the freaking horror. The first game still scares the pants off as where the third is just mowing down everything.

gaming,3dy4ec,MyLittleSconey,6,Mon Jul 20 22:38:06 2015 UTC,"You start the game off by killing humans, nuff said. I still enjoyed the game though, just missed the simple upgrade system they had."

gaming,3dy4ec,ShadowJuggalo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:10:18 2015 UTC,Why do you suppose that is?
gaming,3dy4ec,BradenFontaine,8,Mon Jul 20 20:33:38 2015 UTC,"It was one of the first games with microtransactions. They were completely optional, but you could pay to power up early on instead of earning it through gameplay. That made everyone insane with rage, and the game became a thing that people were expected to hate if they wanted to avoid downvotes. People are right about it being more action than horror, but that doesn't make it suck."
gaming,3dy4ec,ShadowJuggalo,2,Mon Jul 20 20:56:28 2015 UTC,"The micro transactions made a game that before, featured a really tight survival horror feeling (scavenging for whatever items you can being a big part of that) and removed that pretty completely. There's no tension anymore. You're out of health packs? Just buy more with resources outside of the game!  It had loads of other issues besides.  for example, having the real ending tacked onto dlc was pretty shady."
gaming,3dy4ec,PatrickLane17,7,Mon Jul 20 21:04:32 2015 UTC,"It was a matter of principle though, since you didn't actually HAVE to buy that stuff. I didn't, and I never gave a shit."
gaming,3dy4ec,ShadowJuggalo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:07:39 2015 UTC,"Of course you don't have to, but the game still loses significant tension when the option is there and available. It was just a really dumb inclusion in a survival horror game, and sales suffered for it."
gaming,3dy4ec,PatrickLane17,3,Mon Jul 20 21:58:18 2015 UTC,Agreed.
gaming,3dy4ec,ShadowJuggalo,0,Mon Jul 20 22:47:53 2015 UTC,Deadspace was never survival horror it was action horror. I never scrounged for anything and I always had more than enough of anything and enemies were incredibly easy to kill.  You could argue the game lost all sense of horror after the first hour of the first game.
gaming,3dy4ec,Zero_Fs_given,3,Mon Jul 20 21:20:15 2015 UTC,"It's a problem sequels have. While Dead Space 3, by itself, is a great game, when it's held up against its prequels, it falls behind in entertainment value as a horror game. They strayed too far from the established series to becomes an action horror game instead of a horror action game, and those expecting a horror game were bummed out about it being an action game, while those who just wanted an action game avoided it due to the horror elements.  Had Dead Space 3 somehow been a standalone that was not compared to Dead Space 1 or 2, it would have been much more highly praised."
gaming,3dy4ec,Jurk0wski,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:14:58 2015 UTC,I would at least watch a movie of all the cutscenes but playing the game is un-necessary.
gaming,3dy4ec,RagersaurusRex,8,Mon Jul 20 15:43:59 2015 UTC,It wasn't that great. It was cool but not near the caliber of the 1st and 2nd in comparison to horror. Too much focus on the weapons and combat/Multiplayer Co-op to create a better Singleplayer.
gaming,3dy4ec,RagersaurusRex,9,Mon Jul 20 15:02:40 2015 UTC,"as soon as you introduce multiplayer it takes away the ""horror"" feeling. The scene/part of the game in the second one when you arrive back at the Ishimura, man i was literally on the edge of my seat, nausea was creeping up, i could feel every hair on my body stand up and i felt like i was going to puke. The tension was so thick you could taste it in the air, only game to make me that afraid has been Alien Isolation, but Dead Space 1 & 2 hold a special place in my heart to this day."
gaming,3dy4ec,BradenFontaine,4,Mon Jul 20 15:11:13 2015 UTC,"The worst thing about the Ishimura revisit was that you expect something to happen, and it doesn't fucking happen.  It's actually kind of a relief when you finally see a necromorph on the Ishimura, because it's so fucking unsettling when you're waiting for the encounter and it refuses to show itself."
gaming,3dy4ec,lankist,5,Tue Jul 21 00:19:40 2015 UTC,"Seems you understand my struggle as well. Ishimura will always haunt me. Even someone just mentioning it makes me think of the dark hallways and the constant threat of one popping through a vent. That made me think though, that is also a problem with the third game. The environment is to wide open and it's not giving you that sense of claustrophobia that it did with the others."
gaming,3dy4ec,RagersaurusRex,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:21:07 2015 UTC,I won't be buying/playing the third
gaming,3dy4ec,BradenFontaine,9,Mon Jul 20 15:35:41 2015 UTC,IMO it's still worth a playthrough
gaming,3dy4ec,Minimegamax,2,Mon Jul 20 17:21:04 2015 UTC,Maaaaaybe if I see it on a mad mad sale I might consider it.
gaming,3dy4ec,BradenFontaine,3,Mon Jul 20 18:08:18 2015 UTC,It was a dollar during origin humble bundle. Ask around for spare keys.
gaming,3dy4ec,TheXenophobe,4,Mon Jul 20 21:17:00 2015 UTC,"The third is fun in a different way, but not a game that will go down as a classic. You can enjoy it in a playthrough. You won't think, five years down the line, ""I should play Dead Space 3 again.""  The aesthetics of the series are still there--the unique way it handles UI, the cool character and monster designs, the immersive way the game has you navigating its world.  It just isn't scary. In fact, the only parts that left me feeling tense were just the brief callbacks to the first and second games' regenerator enemy, and that still seemed more like the devs said ""well, we're obligated to have a level where this guy shows up, so lets just toss a couple in this one and never again."" By that point, I had a fucking machine gun with a flamethrower on it and a veritably infinite supply of ammunition, so I hardly felt threatened."
gaming,3dy4ec,lankist,2,Tue Jul 21 00:22:18 2015 UTC,there are ways to do multiplayer horror. Dead Space 3 just showed us how to not do multiplayer horror.
gaming,3dy4ec,TyrrTheWook,5,Mon Jul 20 17:32:36 2015 UTC,"The idea of Carver being crazy and Isaac being comparatively sane was interesting, but it wasn't explored enough.  Say Isaac starts appearing like a necromorph to the Carver player at random intervals, and shooting him nets a game over. Maybe necromorphs start looking like Isaac. Then, not only does the Carver player have to worry about regular enemies, they also have to hesitate to make sure they're not in the midst of Carver-Time.  Say, randomly, voice-chat between the two players is severed and they can't communicate before they find a way to fix it.  Say, randomly, when the two players are separated, a doppleganger appears and ""helps"" the Carver player, only for the Carver player to later realize there's two Isaacs on the board.  Maybe Isaac has to stick with his engineering tools and only Carver can use the big guns, but the price of getting the big guns is being the most unreliable observer.  Combine these kinds of elements between a ""sane"" and insane player and you can create spontaneous, unscripted moments of tension. The players can't trust one another, and there's a severe imbalance between them, reducing whatever sense of comfort having a buddy along would grant. The Carver player can't trust what they're seeing, and the Isaac player can't trust the Carver player.  Nothing interesting like that happened. Toy soldiers appeared occasionally and scare chords got played."

gaming,3dy4ec,Pixelated_Piracy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:21:56 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed the second game more, as well. I loved the first one because you just an engineer and were alone most of the time. But I liked how in the second one, you were there pretty much just as the outbreak began, so for the first few missions, you see civilians being killed and turned into necromorphs. It just makes the later levels where almost everyone is dead/turned all the more creepy.  You experience the outbreak from beginning to end."
gaming,3dy4ec,Morguito,3,Tue Jul 21 06:39:55 2015 UTC,I like the opening of the witcher 2 the best. Walking with the king. And climbing the siege tower and then the charge when it opens. Everything about that section was tits.  This one is good as well though.

gaming,3dy4ec,Logitrick,2,Mon Jul 20 19:56:29 2015 UTC,"Dead Space 2 was such an excellently paced game, narrative-wise.  You start the game listening to Blonde Lady.  Then, after you've met her and Stross, you realize ""holy fuck, I am ALONE and is that a goddamn space elementary school?""  Every time you start to get tired of a type of area or scenario, it switches things up and launches you into something new. Every time you think you've found a way to get where you're going, you're fucked over.  This game really nailed the sense of isolation, not because you're isolated all that often but because so much of the game is spent with someone talking in your ear. When that person goes away and you start hearing that fucking nursery music, it's actually spooky.  I still get spooked thinking about that area with the shipping containers and a pack of a dozen fucking raptor-things poking their heads around every corner. Stupid me never backed myself into a corner--I was goddamn surrounded."

gaming,3dy4ec,stetaru,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:50:12 2015 UTC,"I always thought this opening was far too garish and action packed, it didn't provide any sense of horror to me, and I couldn't really bring myself to finish the game.   What separates this from something like P.T. is the sense of pacing and letting atmosphere build up. It's why when things slowly start to become odd, and off in P.T. that it feels so disturbing and so much more scarier. I was far more terrified of the Bathroom Door pounding in P.T., than I was by this display of gore.   Dead Space 1 had some moments of real terror and extreme tension. This game, just failed to pull that off. And felt so much more boring and a chore to play.   Coincidentally, I found Dead Space 3 to be a lot more fun to play because of the coop. At least that was something new. And they actually crafted the coop story quite well into the game. It wasn't fantastic, but well done. It took the obvious action-oriented direction of Dead Space 2, said ""fuck it"", and went balls out with the action in Dead Space 3, while still providing some interesting psychological elements. Which I personally enjoyed.  My own opinion of course. I really liked Dead Space 1, still do, just wish the rest of the series could have done more for me personally."

gaming,3e33by,PlexasAideron,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:16:03 2015 UTC,"Personally, I call it Duke Nukem Syndrome.  When he was new, he was something just so radically different. He swore, he drank, he did drugs, and he splatted his enemies on every surface. He was the first gun-totting, womanizing, one-line-spewing badass to really go mainstream.  Now a days, it's very hard to market that kind of character because there are so fucking many. You can't throw a rock without hitting a generic FPS protagonist. The market is flooded with manly-man tough guys exactly like that, and there's nothing to make any of them stand out. Duke just kinda gets lost in the crowd."

gaming,3e2xuc,Redaftpool,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:40:35 2015 UTC,"I didn't like how the G502 felt, personally. It looks BADASS, but I couldn't bring myself to buy it.   The Deathadder I will always vouch for because I've it it twice - one that had the blue lighting and then I got the Black Edition after the first one met its end.   However, other options do exist. Not a fan of the Naga Epic Chroma - imo it's really only necessary for MMOs as opposed to other genres like FPS. Can still be used for them but at that point - onto my next suggestion.  Look at the ROCCAT brand of mice. I grabbed a Tyon for about $70 on Amazon with a $20 off coupon, and it's pretty much awesome. ROCCAT also has a few ""lower"" end mice to the Tyon, like the Savu and the Kone, which are also great. They also have the Nyth coming up which is like Razer's Naga, so there's that.   Anyway - I'd say cost-wise, go for the Deathadder. If you just want something to look badass and have an overall general purpose, sure, look into the G502 if that's your thing. If you HAVE to have wireless, that's the only reason I'd recommend the Naga. Otherwise, certainly give the ROCCAT lineup a good look - they are amazing."

I've gotten used to it now, but it certainly wasn't comfortable when I first got it.  Other than that, and the useless-in-hindsight side buttons, it has been a rock solid purchase.  My previous mouse was an X7 Oscar, and it was great. It had on-the-fly resolution switching, flashed to the mouse (works on any PC, even without the software) which was handy for quickly switching between fast movement and fine aiming. Couldn't fault it. I only bought the Naga because I though it had died, but it turned out to be the USB port on my PC."

gaming,3duzp5,Sc2God,24,Mon Jul 20 03:57:04 2015 UTC,"They were still working out the mechanics, but damn if the story wasn't interesting. I also really appreciated the focus on assassinations. The rest of the games all seemed like they lost that."
gaming,3duzp5,RegentYeti,8,Mon Jul 20 04:39:46 2015 UTC,"Definitely. The first Assassin's Creed wasn't without its problems, but it is one of the only games in the series which feels like an assassin game, in my opinion. Most of the games after AC: Brotherhood have felt more like adventure games in that with their expansion, they have largely dropped the focus on assassinations.  AC: Unity was disappointingly overlooked by many, but i thought it brought the series back onto the right track with how it handled assassinations. People gave it too much shit without properly considering the mechanics it brought to the table, i think."
gaming,3duzp5,SSAUS,2,Mon Jul 20 05:49:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I think part of this is the power creep of ""we have more processing power, more guys!"" Mindset that seems to have kicked in. This of course, makes it a lot harder to pull off badass assassinations, sometimes annoyingly so. I love Black flag, but unless it is for a mission, I almost never Assassinate. The combat system is hugely improved though. I think I prefer Shadow of Mordor (I know, different series) for reactionary gameplay, but I like the combat a lot more. Ship battles are by far (to me) the best.  Havent played Unity yet, hoping the bugs get fixed and it goes on sale."

gaming,3duzp5,Metroidman,18,Mon Jul 20 18:56:51 2015 UTC,"Ever play the original pirates off the Caribbean? Im guessing the development team for black flag based BF off that game. It was amazing, it really doesn't go off the movies and the ship battles were intense. The trading was heavier, you can make/break alliances with the countries in the game (yes there were more than two) and you can actually have a fleet of ships following you, it was a really great game for its time. The thing BF did better was the combat, ship boarding (when you board in pirates of the Caribbean it goes through a load screen) and the traveling through open water (pirates had a sort of mini map unlike BF). If you have an original Xbox I would seriously consider checking it out, the world seems much bigger than BF and there's also an awesome Easter egg where you can stumble across the black pearl sailing through the world (don't try to fight it because it will fuck you up)."

gaming,3duzp5,dissonant_worlds,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:40:05 2015 UTC,"From Wikipedia:    Age of Pirates 2: City of Abandoned Ships is a role-playing video game developed by Akella,[2] which was released on May 26, 2009. It is the sequel to Sea Dogs (2000), Pirates of the Caribbean (2003), and Age of Pirates: Caribbean Tales (2006). Like Caribbean Tales, it does not boast either of the two former games' names, due to legal reasons.  What I'm saying is find a copy of Age of Pirates 2, because it's Pirates of the Caribbean with 6 more years of tech behind it.  I had the most incredible time playing that game... I still get excited when I recall the time I was escorting my own trade galleon and got attacked by a Spanish fleet... I drove my ships into a storm to try to lose them but they followed.  I was severely outgunned and I literally had to maneuver my ship to time it so I was behind massive swells when they fired on me.  My treasure ship made it out and so did my flagship, but the storm took 2 of my other ships and thankfully caused the Spanish to retreat.  I cleared with enough booty to upgrade my fleet from it, though.  Calculated loss."

Some might be   They want to simulate the experience a casual or intermediate gamer might have by playing the game. Having an MLG pro bunnyhop headshot his way through the map would look unnatural and probably a bit intimidating to the casual gamer. They want to allow players to see the enemy models and the worlds / maps they've created in their full form. Which is why they always let enemies spawn, animate themselves, run towards the player etc. They want to show what they've built, and blasting away waves of enemies right as they appear on screen or just running straight for the objectives takes away from all of the more intricate details they've worked into the game and want to showcase."

gaming,3du770,Bilski1ski,1653,Sun Jul 19 15:21:36 2015 UTC,Ape Escape WAS the first game that required the dual shock controller.
gaming,3du770,LightlessDark,642,Sun Jul 19 16:38:21 2015 UTC,Yup. The demo came with a special notification saying you needed a dual shock. I ignored it and tried to play it. Couldn't. D-pad just moved the camera.  I was pissed. I didn't get a DS controller for a long time. Eventually played it at a friend's and it was fantastic.

I actually to this day own my original ps1 dualshock blue controller I used and loved how I was able to play given the odd requirement. As a kid, nothing made me happier.  Fustratingly this controller is NOT compatible with many ps2 games, because it can't detect that it's actually dualshock."
gaming,3du770,chargeo1,64,Sun Jul 19 18:07:05 2015 UTC,Is the PS2 problem due to the four face buttons being analog on the Dualshock2 though?  I seem to recall that being a thing when the PS2 came out.

gaming,3du770,UltraChilly,32,Sun Jul 19 18:59:37 2015 UTC,"The Gran Turismo games definitely made use of it; throttle and brake were both mapped to face buttons, so you still had variable throttle/braking.

Some of the really old ones were just red sheets with some number pairs on. It said number x, you had to find the matching number and type in y.

gaming,3du770,klapaucius,92,Sun Jul 19 18:22:22 2015 UTC,One of the things people never realized was that you could set up a control scheme that let you play Goldeneye with two N64 controllers. This let you have dual analog control over the game.
gaming,3du770,rudolfs001,78,Sun Jul 19 18:46:02 2015 UTC,"The coolest thing I did with my N64 as a kid was using the cheat code in Star Wars Episode 1 Racer that activated ""arcade mode"" controls that simulated the cabinet's setup.  You held a controller in each hand and used the analog sticks for throttle and brake. Turning meant throttling one engine while backing off or braking on the other, you turned the podracer on its side by pulling the sticks to the same side, and to activate boost, you pressed both Z buttons at once."

gaming,3du770,waterbuffalo750,50,Sun Jul 19 15:18:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if you realize this or not, but the modern two-stick control scheme (left controls movement, right controls aim) wasn't always common. I remember playing FPS games where one control stick controls forward/backward movement and also turns left and right. When you only have one control stick, this makes total sense as long as everything you have to look at is at the same vertical height. You can also include a sort of ADS button for looking up and down, but you can't move while doing it.  And then with a second control stick, games kept the old one-stick controls but then added vertical look in the second stick along with strafing. So you can play the game entirely off of the left stick until you need to look up or down. You never really need to strafe, but if you wanted to do so you would use the right stick.  I'm not condoning this control scheme. I don't like it and I was never good at playing with it, but that's just how it was back then."

I became so accustomed to this that still to this day if a console fps doesn't let me switch the controls to where I move with right hand and look with left hand I just can't play it.  I played COD with friends, and they freaked out trying to move when we swapped controllers back.  Southpaw bumper jumper is the absolute best setup for me on console fps'."

Not wanting to ruin the party or whatever but AoE2's campaigns are HIGHLY  fictional in their retelling of History : Constantinople's sacking being presented as justified because the emperor refused to open the door, Joan of Arc being tracked by english and bourguignon before she was anyone important, Genghis Khan attacking the Great Wall of China (the Great Wall was built by Kublai Khan, the defense system in the north that existed during Genghis' time was not attacked as their defenders joined Genghis)"

gaming,3dwgvf,Zedthewise,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:22:26 2015 UTC,"Umm, you know the Great Wall was started in like two hundred B.C. right? And the defenders didn't so much join Genghis Khan as the Mongol horsemen just rode around the incomplete, and ill-cared for wall.  And Kublai Khan, and the Yuan Dynasty by extension, had nearly nothing to do with the wall. Mongols had no interest in building walls, their horsemen served as walls."
gaming,3dwgvf,SpooniestBard,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:12:39 2015 UTC,"The part about the emperor dying in a river and being pickled in a barrel of vinegar, though? That part totally happened for real.   On 10 June 1190, Emperor Frederick drowned in the Saleph river. Accounts of the event are conflicting. Some historians believe he may have had a heart attack that complicated matters. Some of Frederick's men put him in a barrel of vinegar to preserve his body.  {...}  The video game Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings has a campaign which follows Fredrick Barbarossa from the period of his struggles in Germany to his death on the Third Crusade. It is of note that Barbarossa never appears as an actual unit in the game, though the objective of the final level (after his death) is to take a unit named ""Emperor in a Barrel"" to the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem."

gaming,3dwgvf,GumdropGoober,2,Mon Jul 20 07:48:44 2015 UTC,Really? I wasn't aware that level was some kind of technical feat. It was sure appreciated though!  That mission has got to be one of the best in the entire game. Multiple objectives (with branching paths!) voice acting and in-level plot development (something AOE almost never did)... and it was fun and engaging even though you don't construct any buildings the entire time... it really drives home the theme of mongols as a nomadic people.  The only other missions that do that are Joan of Arc's opening and one level from Saladin's campaign (IIRC).

Man, if you are going to complain like this at least actively support those games that do it by purchasing them...The reason local multiplayer has taken a back seat is because you make more money when you sell more copies of the game, and with local multiplayer you only have to buy one copy to have many people play.   I am not saying he is wrong...i love local multiplayer, but spend some money to support the games that have it."

And I'm never going to spend $60 on a plants vs zombies game, that's just me.  And I totally get your point about them selling more copies, it makes complete sense.  But there have been plenty times I would have purchased a game if it had local multiplayer.  For instance NFS Rivals; I would have purchased that game if it included a splitscreen feature.  Local multiplayer is a huge selling point for me.  So yes, I do support developers that include the feature, but I'm not going to pay $60 for a game I have no interest in just because it has a feature that I want."

The original and legacy BIOS have both been overwritten/removed, so the card is not recognised at all when it is plugged in. I have attempted to flash both the original and the legacy bios from a Bootable DOS usb, but my pc does not even recognise that the card is plugged into the PCI-E Slot.  The model number is 10 02 67 98 and the BIOS I used was this: http://www.techpowerup.com/vgabios/152305/msi-r9280x-3072-131226.html  The only thing i haven't attempted would be the 1+8 pin trick, as i am trying to return the card as Mis-sold, and do not want to break it any further.  If you have any advice then it would be great appreciated :)"
gaming,3dxton,SippieCup,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:49:42 2015 UTC,"are you running your computer in UEFI boot? if so switch to the oldschool boot first and see if it sees the card.  second, do you have onboard graphics? i7 or something?  third, do you have multiple pci-e slots?"

I have a Sabertooth 990fx and the BIOS does not even recognise that the card is plugged in, no power is going through the board to the card. With the card in, if I have the HDMI plugged into the card, it just get a quick spin of the GPU fans and then red lights on my board. With the HDMI in another card, the fans on the card spin up to full and the pc boots fine, Just without recognising the card as being there at all.   :EDIT: I managed to miss the other questions...

gaming,3dxton,SippieCup,2,Mon Jul 20 19:29:15 2015 UTC,"alright heres what to do.  put in the AMD card into a different PCIE slot than the primary one. (suggest slot 4 just to be safe).  use the same rom you originally downloaded and boot into ATIFLASH. Also connect the dead card via VGA so that it 'knows' to boot up, you can connect to to a differen montior or the same one or whatever (or just short the VGA connector like you do for bitcoin mining.  This should get the card to at least boot, even if not readable, which is all you need.  Now before doing anythinglike listing devices, ocne ATIFLASH boots up do  ATIFLASH -f -p 0 BIOS.rom  if that fails.  ATIFLASH -f -newbios -p 0 BIOS.rom  if that doesnt work you need to reset the EEPROM  P.s. Make sure you use ATIFLASH 4.17  http://www.techpowerup.com/downloads/2306/atiflash-4-17/mirrors  if still bricked report back.   Make sure you are booting in BIOS mode and not UEFI."
gaming,3dxton,crutchfieldt21,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:38:01 2015 UTC,"Attempting now. This is the same procedure I have tried already, but one more time can't hurt.   I'm am more than competent with flashing the bios but I wouldn't trust myself with resetting the EEPROM, If it went wrong and I broke the card any further then I would have no chance to return the card to the seller. From what I have seen I'm fairly sure that this is what the seller has attempted already, but may not have done it properly."

gaming,3dxton,crutchfieldt21,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:57:31 2015 UTC,"Yup. Both the Original and legacy BIOS were overwritten. TBH, that is the biggest issue. With no BIOS on the card AT ALL, no power is going through the card, and my computer doesn't recognise anything being plugged in, so I can't do anything with the card.   I have tried unlocking + flashing the BIOS in both BIOS modes, as well as attempting to clear off the Linux Firmware (If it is even still on the card, I'm still not sure) In Win 8.1, 7, and a Bootable DOS Disk. Just tried again from the DOS disk and still nothing, I just get adaptor not found on 0 or 1."

gaming,3dy9w7,Momentanius,6,Mon Jul 20 14:55:24 2015 UTC,"SPOILERS:  Oh my god yes. I've always said this. There is so much human experience in this story that almost never gets represented in media. Both Ramza and Delita were brought up in an environment where they were sheltered from many aspects in the world, but they had no concept that they actually had been sheltered. Their ""experience of their experience"" is just like anyone else's ""experience of their experience"" - it seems complete. Then they were exposed repeatedly to events that made no sense within their worldview, and you watch them slowly change their minds over time. This is similar to the ""deconversion"" process people in a lot of religions go through.  Most media doesn't give these kinds of emotional journeys the respect they deserve, but FFT, in the first chapter at least, is actually less about the events in play and more about Ramza, Delita, their lives, their perspectives, their relationship, and their emotional/intellectual journey when everything they know gets upended.  Then you get dumped into the second chapter and the plot takes off. Two countries are increasing their aggression toward each other as they dance for political positions, which eventually leads to full-scale war. Then the church gets involved, which is revealed to have suppressed the truth and built a false narrative that is only loosely based on actual events. The church manipulates this narrative to seize power without fully understanding what they are dealing with, and their strings are pulled by the lucavi.   It's just layers and layers and complex character interactions and competing/mutual interests driving and destroying alliances as the political landscape changes. And all of this is used to set the scene for the gameplay.  It's fucking brilliant. One of the most expertly crafted narrative arcs in all of gaming. Right up there with The Last of Us et. al."

I can see why you would like one game better than the other, they're completely different experiences. But I can't imagine any reason anyone would prefer the KH story to the FFT story other than the possibility that they just don't like stories mucking up their video games and KH's story was much, much more sparse and shallow. Or maybe that they couldn't keep track of the FFT story and were confused by it."

It's written in a way that doesn't give everything away and keeps audience guessing with hints and multiple possible outcomes which we'll have to wait to see, we're seven games in so far and the fanbase is still trying to work out what's going on in the subtext of the game. Personally I prefer this story and its lore more than I liked the story to FFT. Although I still think FFT is an amazing game with an amazing story."

They create a world (with amazing art) and your progress is rewarded with tiny vague details of a story leaving it open for your interpretation.   Art makes you think. And those games function on the story players create. It needs your creative mind to be good.

I.e., when they try to look like a painting or some abstract video art.   Instead, I'd argue it is games that exhibit the aesthetics and experiences unique to games/gaming with qualities you can't simply quantify that deserve being called 'art' the most. A list of personal examples of mine should certainly include:    PONG (Not the first video game, but the first of such aesthetical magnitude.)  Pac-Man (More so than Donkey Kong, even.)  Super Mario Bros.  Out Run (the arcade machine)  Afterburner II (the arcade machine)  TLoZ -- Link's Awakening DX    More recently:    Portal 1 & 2  FEZ (Both artsy AND 'art'.)

Because I really invest my time into games. I don't play something for a like week and then, forget about it. I average playing a single video game for 3 to 6 months. (Currently finishing out Bioshock Infinite on 360.) Steam is for people who like building massive collections of games and playing something new every week.   I also LIKE hard copies of games and HATE this ""digital"" bullshit. I don't even feel like I own anything if it's just some digital file that literally has no value and can be copied and multipled an infinite number of times. Game discs make me feel like I actually own something. Online data purchases make me feel like I got ripped off and probably could've found this shit for free on Mediafire.

I doubt my deal will last very long, but I'm not looking to pay more than that. If I need a high speed internet connection to play games, that's a problem.

In the PC world there is always a steep drop in price for components that have recently been displaced by next generation tech.  That is where you get the most bang for your buck.  You get a marginally less powerful PC for half the price.  Spend 2 weeks researching each and every piece from CPU, RAM, SSD, MB, GPU...

I know, it seems very intimidating, but it's not that hard if you do some research. /r/buildapc is a great resource! You can always use your 360. A lot of pc games have native controller support, and if they don't you can emulate the controller with programs like Xpadder. If you're playing online a good connection is always better. But for single player games no internet is required (on most games).  No, why would you need to? But steam does make stuff easier.

Building your own is always the best option, but going with an off-lease prebuild business machine and upgrading the ram, GPU, and power supply is always an option too.  You can get something like this to start with and upgrade as you can. You could throw a gtx 750 Ti in there and probably not even need to upgrade the power supply. You may even be able to go with a gtx 960.   Will I always be able to use my 360 controller for future PC games?   Yes! The xbox 360 controller is the best supported controller at this time.   Is a high-speed internet connection (which I don't always have) always going to be a requirement?   Most DRM for games these days requires online activation even if you buy a physical copy.   Am I going to have to join Steam? (I hate Steam and only hear bad things about it.)   No! You can buy your games through GOG, green man gaming, humble bundle, etc. I would be more interested to hear what you have heard about steam. It is actually a quite nice system.   Are there any good games (console exclusives) that I'd be missing out on PC? (Right now, I don't see any.)   The up and coming Halo game. Forza titles. Some games from Japan for the PS4, but that's about it.  Personally, I'm going back the other way. I've been a PC gamer for years, but I just bought an xbox one.  Here are my reasons for going the other direction.   Multiplayer is a more consistent experience. Everybody uses the same voice chat system, everybody has the same inputs, the controller really levels the playing-field. With PC, there is no cap on how good you can get with a mouse and keyboard. But noobs get slaughtered. Console multi-player is a more equal experience. Having the better hardware can often mean having an advantage in the game. This is especially apparent in games like call of duty where weapon fire rate is tied directly to your frames per second. This is an old quake3ism. http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-3202750.html   Even if you can't perceive the difference between 200 and 300 fps, the computer knows.   A pure focus on gaming. When I sit down in front of a computer, I'll check reddit, I'll check facebook, then my email, then back to reddit, then maybe get into a game. Oops, left the browser window open, and now my bro wants to chat about something. Takes you back out.   Now, steam big picture mode solves a lot of this, but that takes your PC and turns it into a console for you, and works great with a gamepad, but it feels shoehorned in. The advantage of playing on PC is using a mouse and keyboard.  With xbox, you turn it on, and within 30 seconds, you are gaming, and you can go for hours without the distraction.   The games aren't as cheap, but I have a third of my steam library I haven't even touched. I just bought games because they were on sale, and have no intention of playing them. It's just silly. Every purchase on the x1 is a big purchase, so I have to think if I'm really going to play a game, or if it's just going to sit in the vault. Backward compatibility is touted as a huge advantage for gaming on PC, but in practice, not so much. Most games released for Dos/Windows between 1990 and 2002 are unplayable without some generous tweaking. There is dosbox for a subset of these games, but there is nothing to get the older directx games working again. There is no Windows 98 SE emulator.   Games that are currently sold on steam, Specifically, the dark forces 2 games, simply do not run on modern systems. They are still sold, but they simply do not work."

What I did was check the online classifieds for my area (similar to CL) or if you are anywhere near a military base look up the bookoo site for it (tons of soldiers always deploying and trying to sell off their stuff for ((usually)) really good deals) Doing this I found a decent barebones pc for $400 came with 8gigs of ram a slighty outdated but decent video card, mobo, and cpu. over the next year, I doubled my ram ($120), bought an awesome video card ($280) ,And just recently got a new cpu. so spending around a grand over the course of a year I can now play virtually all the next gen titles (alien isolation, dying light, dead rising 3, GTAV) all at 60fps without breaking a sweat. Most games have at least partial controller support, especially with Steam. High speed is not a requirement, but nowadays pretty much everything PC is a digital download. AAA titles can be 50 gigs a piece! Steam really isn't that bad, as long as you only buy games from steam when they're 80% off or more.  Most other steam games you can get much, much cheaper with sites like g2a.  I enjoy steam as a platform where all my games are there, forever. The community isn't too shabby either.

gaming,3e1zj0,coldstarsdie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:44:58 2015 UTC,"No worries there the main components are as follows. Motherboard (mobo) :Nervous system of the PC CPU:Brain RAM:How fast your PC can multitask Video/Graphics Card: How pretty you want your games to be. Breaking it down Barney style it goes like this;  Since it's going to be a gaming PC you might as well go with the biggest case you can find (atx is your standard large case and it goes down from there, mid-tower would work but if you end up getting a ginourmous graphics card it might not fit, then micro and mini, those two are better geared for non-gamers.  Then you have to choose between the two factions AMD or Intel processors (CPU), because you have to basically build your PC around that. IMO Intel has better quality, however I go with AMD because I get almost exactly the same outcome for a third of the price. These days most processors have standardized sizes, my processor is an AM3+ and it is a 9950, now you have to find a mobo that 1.)has a AM3+ cpu slot and 2.) supports the 9900 series processors. (newegg and other sites give you that information) Once you have that done you need your RAM and they come in a bunch of frequencies which you can learn more about later, for now you just need to go off the newegg or whatever site and get the same frequency RAM that the mobo supports (2133) The more RAM your mobo can support the better 32gigs is awesome right now, but that's like top of the line.   Then you gotta pick a graphics card, I go with AMD since it works better with my cpu (easier overclocking) the R9 series is pretty good right now, I'm running 1 4gb r9 270 and it's amazing. The more dedicated RAM your graphics card has, the better. the 1 and 2 gb cards are cheaper,but the performance is worth the little bit of extra money. Once you have all those the rest is pretty straight forward, a power supply for your rig 1000w is perfect for an average gamer, a hard drive (regular HDD are awesome if you're taking up a lot of space. SSD (solid state drives) are wicked fast but expensive, I use one for the main game that I am playing and just switch it out.) a cpu cooler, so you don't burn a hole in your mobo, case fans (cheaper is NOT better with these, it'll sound like you're in an airplane if you get a bunch of cheap ones.) Everything else is pretty much optional (wireless card, sound card ((optional if you're using headphones)), case mods like lights and fan controllers.  That's all I can really think of (sorry at the tail end of my night shift) but that's pretty much the gist of it.  A helpful tool that I use is pcpartpicker you can go look at sales,reviews, builds, and there's a compatibility tool that will tell you if your part is compatible with the rest.  If you have any questions feel free to PM me, I've now built 4 PCs with no instruction other than youtube and such.  Good Luck!"
gaming,3e1zj0,Sixteen_Million,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:44:45 2015 UTC,"You have a lot of misinformation about Steam. Steam is no different from Xbox Live other than it has many more games available, is free to play online and it doesn't go offline nearly as often.  You're very against keyboard and mouse for gaming but eventually I'd give that another thought. I played on consoles from NES to 360 as well. Basically from age 3 to age 20.   I had the same attitude toward keyboard and mouse when I first built my rig. I only used a controller for the first year or so. Finally took the time to adapt to keyboard and mouse and the difference is staggering. Its just a better way to play in my opinion.   People say it is more precise, which it is no doubt about it. I am much more accurate with my mouse after 2 years of use than I am with a controller after nearly 20 years of use.   The main reason I prefer kb/m is the immersive aspect though. I've never heard anyone talk about this but for me there is something about it that draws me into a game in ways a controller can't. I think it's just that more of my body is used to control things, rather than just my thumbs essentially.   You will indeed save a lot of money by building your PC yourself. The first one I got was prebuilt and I had to buy a graphics card for it. That tallied up to $800 at the time. A couple years later I was aware of the mistake I made so I build from scratch. I spent $824 and I got a computer that was roughly 3 times more capable than my prebuilt.   Just know that PC gaming is the luxury gaming world. I like to equate it to enthusiast automobile owners.   You can game on a Toyota Camry (console) and have some reliable plug and play gaming sessions but the quality isn't going to be anything to write home about. You're going to get the barebones experience.   You can game on a Subaru STi (prebuilt) and get a much higher end experience but with the possibility of limited upgrade options and you'll lack that true ownership feeling.   You can buy a rolling chassis and build the car of your dreams (building your PC) and you will have the best possible experience you decide to build for and your creation will be unique to you.   TLDR. Steam is great, you have misperceptions. Keyboard and mouse is worth it coming from a 20 year console gamer. You should definitely look into building your rig yourself. Its worth it and the cheapest route actually."

They tried on console, but since joypads already were the standard there, nobody gave a sh!t.    M+KB are much faster and give much greater control as well as having a whole bunch of bindable space for actions. Try playng Quake or starcraft on a console and you would see why its not doable with a gamepad. I do use a controller for some games like fighting and driving games, but not for fps, rts, mmo or anything else   Either you're running PONG on that PC... or you've got some deeeeeep gaming wallet there. LOL    My pc cost £500 and I primarily bought it for work. I play FPS games like Quake, Reflex, CSGO and some moba games like Dota 2 (again games that arent playable on console or play terrbily with a gamepad)  I know youre just a troll but this is weak.

gaming,3e1zj0,fallenKlNG,0,Tue Jul 21 12:09:57 2015 UTC,"M&Kb: This control option has its own unique properties. Genres that grew on PC had to make do with this surrogate 'gaming' control option, which wasn't designed for gaming at all, and made use of those properties. So it's little surprise that those genres still today require those properties -- even though gamepads are the preferred (and increasingly available) option, all in all. M&Kb have become a specialty. It is merely this continued legacy of old PC-born genres that still justifies M&Kb for gaming at all. As game makers start adapting their FPSs etc. to joypad controls, the justification for resorting to cumbersome M&Kb will disappear. Especially when factoring in joypads with integrated touch pads and/or gyroscopes.       I play FPS games like Quake     So basically, you are running PONG.   :shrugs:"

A controller is the definition of a cumbersome way to control a game character   It is merely this continued legacy of old PC-born genres that still justifies M&Kb for gaming at all.   That and how much better you can play with them. Try going against a m+kb user in an fps game. Or try playing a deep rts game.   So basically, you are running PONG.    You picked one out the list I mentioned. But yes quake is easiest to run out of that list. I play every quake from 1 to 4 to live. Each other them going at ~300fps. The other games are much more recent, reflex being from 2014.  Even if I delve into some casual single player AAA things that you seem to think are the only games worth playing I am running them at around 100fps.  I would really hate to be capped at 60fps, moving around with a controller on already obselete hardware that I payed 300 bucks for. But the main reason I play on PC is the games. None of the games I play and enjoy on a day to day basis are even available on consoles, and if they were, it would be a terrible, capped framerate, janky controller using experience  All the other things that pc does better than console are just a bonus"

If the PC you get isn't the most powerful, you will still most likely be able to play almost all current games, plus have endless backwards compatibility. Plus, unless there is an exclusive you really enjoy, any multi plat game is available on PC already, so it doesn't matter about backwards compatibility anyway. Its also not necessarily cheaper, as the amount you pay for games will help with the price in the future. U less your buying a game as it comes out or when it is not on sale, you will almost never pay gull price for a game, I know I don't. I even know of people who build less powerful computers capable of tunning games from 1-2 years back, so they never have to worry about glitches, bugs and do t pay full price on games ever. They also don't have to spend as much on their PCs as the games they play require less capable hardware.

The story of these games are comparable to Trumps bid for presidency. They are a joke full of dumb one liners and filled with racism and a lack of education in which the enemies. Usually Arabic, Chinese, or Russian. Don't even speak the proper language of their nation.  Conflict Desert Storm on the other hand. Is a third person campaign based shooter that supports up to four players on co-op and involves at least an inkling of tactics. Something that remains to be seen on Call of Duty and Battlefield. The stories of Conflict also make sense and are far more realistic than the premise of Modern Warfare which revolves around a highly uncreatively named Russian terrorist igniting World War 3 just for shits and giggles.

Most of those games are not complicated, do not require a lot of time and would not benefit that much from having a controller.  And for the ones that do, I think carrying around a small controller like this is better, at least then you can decide whether you want to take the controller with you or not (when you're going on a long trip for example).  The option for integrating things like this in a phone would probably either be: a bulky phone, a phone with a small screen or a phone with bad hardware because there's no space left.  (and an external controller also does seem to be how this designer solved the problem of a controller, which in the end kind of means that this phone isn't really special in any way, except the modular cartridges which has nothing to do with gaming and the Nintendo design to it.)"

The idea is that they can't charge 60$ for a ""core game"" on their platform if other games are free or super cheap. Standard consumers don't reason well, and they will just get mad because they don't see the difference between the two. They won't buy the 60$ game because it had a higher entry cost.   It creates confusion and devalues their other products. Sadly though, its happening whether they like it or not because regardless if they want to devalue their brand, other games are doing it for them. F2P and MTX have been a blight on gaming and more traditional companies. They have to hope whales buy their product or they go out of business. Could you image what a f2p pokemon game would be like?

gaming,3dtpxe,GoldenKevin,11,Sun Jul 19 13:23:49 2015 UTC,"Agreed, emulation is still just plain imperfect on mobile phones. I worry that the interpretation overhead sucks too much precious juice from my battery for me to play on a regular basis, and on non flagship phones that are years old, the irregular frame skipping detracts from the experience."
gaming,3dtpxe,ONEMariachi,7,Sun Jul 19 13:35:18 2015 UTC,"agreed, Nintendo will likely wait until their handheld devices properly die off before doing it though. That seems to be how they operate, which is frustrating."
gaming,3dtpxe,latelessthe,28,Sun Jul 19 13:36:34 2015 UTC,"A lot of people do use emulators -- but 90% of people don't know about emulation, where to get the roms, how to put an emulator on iOS, etc. And even of the 10% who do know about emulators, a decent chunk would rather pay $5 to just have a regular app for it, I'm sure."
gaming,3dtpxe,feralkitsune,6,Sun Jul 19 13:37:40 2015 UTC,Doesn't mean a ton of people won't buy the games. I would. And I already own them. Not having to use a shitty emulator would just be a plus for me.
gaming,3dtpxe,TheSecretMe,14,Sun Jul 19 13:41:57 2015 UTC,They know. They've already said they want to move into the mobile market. They also want to maintain a Nintendo standard of quality.
gaming,3dtpxe,Seesawkarma,14,Sun Jul 19 13:22:09 2015 UTC,Quality is a rare commodity in the mobile phone market. Mostly because the idea encompasses longevity.
gaming,3dtpxe,icantshoot,4,Sun Jul 19 13:51:22 2015 UTC,"Or actually made a phone that you can play all their own games with besides everything else? I mean, they made their own hardware since now and mobile market is the most biggest, growing one now. They would be stupid not to have even considered taking part on that.  All the phone needs is to be durable, designed to fit the hands both ways and have Nintendo logo on it and it would sell millions."
gaming,3dtpxe,heysully,9,Sun Jul 19 13:21:25 2015 UTC,"Eh, anything besides a phone maybe, but the upgrade cycle of phones, availability of emulators, and prior establishment of OSes makes it kind of a hard market to break into. Look at the Xperia or example. I don't think people would be willing to give up the familiarity of iOS or Android to switch to an unknown platform with who knows how little third party support (if it's anything like Nintendo's other hardware, the first party software will be close to the only thing that is even worth looking at) just to play games that can be emulated already for free."
gaming,3dtpxe,nstalker91,4,Sun Jul 19 13:36:28 2015 UTC,That and Nintendo has never really followed the crowd so to speak.

gaming,3dtpxe,Randomd0g,232,Sun Jul 19 13:23:32 2015 UTC,"Which, if the screen was AMOLED (which it probably would be) actually means no power would be saved. AMOLED only saves power by 'displaying' black, because it actually just turns black pixels entirely off. Therefore a green mode would do nothing."
gaming,3dtpxe,enderandrew42,97,Sun Jul 19 13:35:14 2015 UTC,"Yep. You can save on power by reducing brightness, but green does nothing to reduce power."

gaming,3dtpxe,r3gnr8r,7,Sun Jul 19 14:30:08 2015 UTC,Would a full black and white mode save power then? Both having the same screen brightness of course for actual comparison.   I would love to have the ability to power save while still being able to see the screen during the day.
gaming,3dtpxe,Randomd0g,14,Sun Jul 19 14:39:54 2015 UTC,Yes. A lot of Samsung's phones have a grayscale mode in their power saving options.

gaming,3dtpxe,BlazeDrag,130,Sun Jul 19 12:35:38 2015 UTC,I think he means the game controller add-on especially. all the buttons are at the bottom where you'd hold it. Hold your hands out like you're holding a phone sideways. Now place your thumbs over your pinkie fingers and imagine playing a game like that.
gaming,3dtpxe,Ree81,30,Sun Jul 19 12:44:18 2015 UTC,"Agreed. It needs to be a 3DS layout, with a larger base that can rest in your hands. Or a PSP type layout.  Sigh When will smartphone gaming actually get a good physical controller standard?"
gaming,3dtpxe,Griddamus,16,Sun Jul 19 13:32:11 2015 UTC,"It's an impossibility.   In order to make a phone with suitable face controls it would make the phone large and unwieldy (see the N-Gauge).   To add a third party accessory you can clip to the sides of your phone to access batteries etc then also means you need to carry that around with you too, which defeats the point of 'portable gaming'.   The only solution I see to this is having the buttons on the back of the phone, and even then it may take some getting used to operating a d pad effectively backwards."
gaming,3dtpxe,Charwinger21,4,Sun Jul 19 13:42:51 2015 UTC,"Don't forget the fact that you have to pick and chose between expandable storage (non-standard form factor) or a camera (which benefits from expandable storage), both of which are way bigger than they need to be (wasted space).  Did I mention that the ""8-bit mode"" would provide no real power savings with modern smartphone tech?"
gaming,3dtpxe,Transill,101,Sun Jul 19 13:46:14 2015 UTC,I loved it until the battery/storage/camera were all separate componants that could only be attached to the phone one at a time. What?  Edit: i went back and looked at it again and that is just plain retarded. I would say make that slot swap out camera/gb style printer/other specialty componants. That would be crazy.
gaming,3dtpxe,20quid,45,Sun Jul 19 12:59:22 2015 UTC,"They're meant to be expansion slots. So the phone already has an internal battery, storage and camera, but you can temporarily upgrade it with extra features depending on what you need at the time.  So rather than having to choose between battery/storage/camera, you're actually choosing between extra battery/extra storage/3d camera.  Seeing as this is a concept with almost no hope of reaching market, I think it was more a reference to the old gameboy than an attempt at a serious design feature."
gaming,3dtpxe,peanutismint,17,Sun Jul 19 13:46:43 2015 UTC,"I think they're meant to be in addition to the internals..... It says '3D camera' on that one insert; there's already an internal camera.... Isn't it obvious from the fact that, to use that camera, you'd have to remove the battery....?!!"
gaming,3dtpxe,smedrick,40,Sun Jul 19 13:37:51 2015 UTC,"It's concept art. The artist is suggesting possibilities for the expansion slot. Each cartridge could extend the phone functionalities.

gaming,3dtpxe,matthias7600,13,Sun Jul 19 13:37:52 2015 UTC,Those controls would be very poorly weight balanced being on the bottom of the device like that.  I don't find this a very good prototype design at all.

Here are my findings as follows, with the first number being what they would give you as store credit and the second is what they would give you in cash    Batman Arkham Asylum GOTY: $1.50 and $1.20  Batman Arkham City GOTY: $4 and $3.20  Bioshock Infinite: $2 and $1.60  Borderlands GOTY: $5 and $4  Call of Duty Black Ops: $2.50 and $2  Call of Duty Black Ops 2: $7 and $5.60  Modern Warfare 3: $.50 and $.40  Dead Space: $2 and $1.60  Dead Space 2: $1 and $.80  Dead Space 3: $2.50 and $2  Dishonored: $.75 and $.60  Fallout 3 GOTY: $5 and $4  Final Fantasy X/X-2: $8 and $6.40  Gran Tourismo 5 Prologue: $.50 and $.40  Gran Tourismo 5: $.75 and $.60  Gran Tourismo 6: $5 and $4  Grand Theft Auto 4 Complete Edition: $2 and $1.60  Jak and Daxter Collection: $6 and $4.80  Killzone Trilogy: $6 and $4.80  LA Noire: $.50 and $.40  LittleBigPlanet GOTY: $1.50 and $1.20  LittleBigPlanet 2 Special Edition: $7 and $5.60  Mass Effect Trilogy: $12 and $9.60  Metal Gear Solid HD Collection: $4.50 and $3.60  Mirror's Edge: $6 and $4.80  Mortal Kombat: $5 and $4  Ni No Kuni: $2 and $1.60  Portal 2: $6 and $4.80  Red Dead Redemption: $1.50 and $1.20  Sly Cooper Thieves in Time: $4 and $3.20  Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition: $3 and $2.40  Total Credit: $115  Total Cash: $92    I'm not saying that OP SHOULD go trade all of these games in, he shouldn't because he's obviously psyched to have them! But saying that GameStop would ""only give him 20 bucks for the bunch"" is just ludicrous.  I also realize this comment may cause a lot of /r/hailcorporate/ and shill comments to come my way, but if GameStop seriously wanted to pay this jobless college student to ""shill"" for them, well, I wouldn't exactly say no!"

There's a lot of character development for Lara in this game, I ultimately I felt like it made the game even better.

It has all the modern controls and gameplay we know and love, so no tank controls or jumping around in circles firing infinite bullets at bats and bears. They removed the jumping puzzles, which is good because the jumping puzzles in Tomb Raider were absolutely terrible, and replaced them with other puzzles. Sort of like a mix between logic puzzles and Assassin's Creed puzzles.  Here's a fun fact, Prince of Persia: Sands of Time is where all the jumping and running around on walls came from for Assassin's Creed. Pretty cool, eh?"

The reason I say that about Rising is because while it is one of the most fun games I've ever played and chopping people in half is super satisfying I realized that the plot and characters are balls compared to Solid. I didn't care about anyone in rising besides Raiden and Wolf and the actual plot itself was actually kinda dumb. In Solid I cared about or was at least interested in every character including the villains which is really hard to do, well, besides Liquid (I thought he was a pretty weak main villain) and Vulcan Raven. I think Solid is a pretty high standard though, Rising was at least a good game in its own right. I think that a Grey Fox game in Rising's engine would have a ton of potential and could actually compete with the Solud series though."

gaming,3dw17w,HappyHashBrowns,18,Mon Jul 20 00:23:50 2015 UTC,"In Morrowind, the items they sold actually existed. Sometimes they were sitting on shelves and tables, but usually they were put into an unpickable chest somewhere in the cell. If you found it you could use the unlock console command to open it and take everything. Of course you could also just use console commands to spawn that stuff any way.  Merchants would also wear what you sold them if it was better than what they already had on. Everquest guards would use any weapon you gave them until they reset and you could open the inventory on monsters and give the items that would drop when killed by anybody. 1999 Everquest had a class with a polymorph spell that could turn you into anything, even static models, but not buildings. I liked to turn into a copper coin at Freeport and tell people to pick me up.  Well, that's my anecdote."

It was pretty handy as you could give NPC companions power armour regardless of whether they were trained or not.  You could also make hostile NPCs switch to melee weapons by pickpocketing all of their ammunition. It was v handy for getting the slaves out of Paradise Falls!"

I just can't stand modding the PC version with the AC models for example. I don't know why... Maybe part of the game's charm are the sprites really."
gaming,3dw89c,redditmode,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:04:20 2015 UTC,"Realistic? No. We did think it was amazing though, and for a time we really thought it was not gonna get better. This was the kind of graphics we only have on dedicated arcade machines, suddenly available in the living room. The graphics, while dated now, were incredible.  There's probably never going to be a huge leap of technology and graphical fidelity like that of the generation change between the SNES/Genesis to PSX/N64 ever again. One could argue that we're experiencing it through the VR stuff of today, but honestly, we literally added one more dimension to the games. Personally, I think the difference between 2D and 3D is a bit more pronounced than the difference between 3D and True 3D, especially with the near photorealistic graphics we already have.  The stuff we have today, I would never have imagined was possible back then. It would have been science fiction, a fantasy. I am really excited for what the future has in store."

I dunno, I don't care about graphics... but are the ""realistic"" graphics supposed to be even more realistic as years go on? Personally I find it kinda boring. I wish more people made 2D games. I wish more people made games with ""cartoony"" graphics. They all go for the realistic route... :(  Sure, VR is a good thing, but I'm getting kinda tired of it lately. I have a feeling it will be just a fad.  Anyways, I'm still hoping for some innovation instead of going for the ""let's-get-even-more-realistic"" graphics route. I do feel the future has something in store, though."

gaming,3dzwb1,OneFatTurkey,3,Mon Jul 20 21:49:35 2015 UTC,"Most if not all visual novels are of the dating sim variety with NSFW elements in them, how heavy they can be on the balance between story and outright porn will vary though.  Most great anime that have 'supplementary' visual novels are more than likely based off of those visual novels rather than the other way around.  Things I have played that do not have NSFW elements but do feature a good story:  Ever 17 - The out of Infinity   Has multiple routes as per normal visual novels that focus on different characters  No NSFW elements    Planetarian - Dream of Little Star -   Kinetic novel, single path with no branching Key is well known for making great storys Will make you cry like a little girl by the end. It is very short though (A couple hours at most to finish it) No NSFW elements   Umineko no Naku Koro ni (When the seagulls cry)   Kinetic novel VERY LONG No NSFW elements Original Version has poor art, but a PS4 version has been released with better art and is patchable for pc versions.   Some that I have played that contain NSFW elements but a good story:  Fate/Stay Night   Contains NSFW but is patchable to a SFW version. One of the most well know vn's out there Decently long Branching paths that are unlockable   G-senjou no Maou (Devil on G-string)   Contains NSFW elements Several branching paths that do not need to be unlocked Contains some violence   Saya no uta (Song of saya)   Contains NSFW elements and other questionables Heavy violence and a few gore scenes Short Cute otherwise imo.   Tsukihime    Contains NSFW elements Another well know VN Many unlockable paths  Decently long   Grisaia no Kajitsu   NSFW elements some routes heavier than others along with other questionables. Contains some violence  Medium length   Chross Channel   Contains NSFW elements Moderately long Contains some violence.   I do understand this is a rather long post, but I've read many things in this genre and it would be too bad to see someone pass it up because of the generally rather mediocre things that have been able to make their way onto steam.  As another poster said VNDB is a great source to see what has and hasn't been translated into a variety of languages and what content they contain.  I do apologize is the formatting is a bit odd, I don't post on reddit very often."

gaming,3dzwb1,Descatusat,2,Tue Jul 21 03:15:19 2015 UTC,I don't have any experience with these but I'd imagine it depends on the one you play. This is like asking if anime is good. Or if novels are good. The good ones are. Lol. The bad ones aren't.   If you find one that has solid reviews it is most likely pretty good. If it has poor reviews it probably isn't very good.

gaming,3dzwb1,DS-Primity,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:24:17 2015 UTC,Oh yea I remember reading up about this game. Thanks for your input!
gaming,3dzwb1,DS-Primity,2,Mon Jul 20 22:57:45 2015 UTC,"As an avid visual novel reader, I'm inclined to post my opinion.  Visual novels are a very underrated and relatively unknown medium for storytelling. In my experience, I would explain visual novels as having the immersion of a book or novel, combined with the qualities of a show or movie: visuals and sound. While novels leave a lot of details up to the reader's imagination (""too open"") and movies provide all the facts concretely on screen (""too closed""), visual novels provide a good balance between the two.  I would say calling all visual novels 'video games' is a misconception due to the fact that a console is required to play it. There's a large sliding scale when it comes to video games with visual novel elements (and vice versa). Examples of visual novels with video game elements include Phoenix Wright and Danganronpa, and examples of video games with visual novel elements include Persona and Ar Tonelico. In the end, the heart of a visual novel is the story. Although the player can influence major decisions and outcomes, interacting with the game itself is fairly minimal.  TL;DR - Visual novels are a storytelling medium like books or television shows. Dating sims such as Huniepop are not visual novels, as you manipulate most, if not all elements of the game."
gaming,3dzwb1,kirolm,2,Mon Jul 20 23:20:05 2015 UTC,Thank you for your through reply. May I ask what platform you use VN's on?
gaming,3dzwb1,kirolm,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:02:55 2015 UTC,"The most common platform for visual novels include PC (which is the platform I use most for VNs), PS3, PS Vita/PSP, and Nintendo DS/3DS. PC gets the most attention for visual novels, and several are available through Steam.  If you're looking to get into visual novels then I don't want to start you off with something huge that could take several hours to finish, and would recommend To the Moon (PC, Steam), a visual novel with a comparatively short completion time of approximately 3 hours. It has a little bit of interactivity so you don't get completely bored of just reading text. If you're looking to go down that route, however, I would try Planetarian ~the Reverie of a Little Planet~ (PC, Steam), which is a true blue visual novel in the sense that it has no decisions for you to make, and only has one ending."

Interestingly it left my game in a glitched state where I couldn't use the master sword anymore, but everything else was normal. Multiple restarts and various 'state changes' (like turning into a child) didn't fix it, so my last resort was to go through the whole Biggoron sword quest without a sword. It was interesting trying to do the ice cavern with only a bow and hookshot. Getting the Biggoron sword reset everything though and now my master sword works again. Who knows what happened."

gaming,3duzke,witty_observer,2,Sun Jul 19 23:31:47 2015 UTC,"While this is true, it depends on how the 3DS remake handles the final fight. In speed runs of the original, it is possible to get to the Ganon fight as a child. When you enter the arena, Ganon still hits away your master sword that by all logic you should not have. Once you go to get it again, it auto sets the master sword to the default B weapon, despite showing the Kokiri sword, allowing you to finish the battle.  So with all this said, it might have been possible. Assuming the player could get to the fight, Ganon would still knock away the master sword, and it would set it again as your default sword upon retrieving it."

gaming,3dvb1u,AngryTurtle98,4,Mon Jul 20 00:45:26 2015 UTC,"Yes!  Technically, I was gifted this game by my boyfriend - we were being really hyped about it but I didn't want to spend so much on an alpha release ""that would probably never get properly released"". Boy, was I wrong. 26 hours in and I'm addicted as fuck. It has the ""I must go out and gather resources to build"" factor Minecraft has, but a lot more challenging. We spent the entire day playing yesterday and we've just been able to set a base with a spawning point. The item crafting recipes are a lot more expensive, but not in the ""gosh this takes too long, I give up"" way.   And even if you get killed by a bunch of raptors for the 27th time, you'll still say ""omg that was so cool fucking dinosaurs"".  Bonus points, the game is (going to be) compatible with Oculus Rift. My boss has an Oculus Rift and I was able to test the watching sample of Ark - amaaazing! It was just a ""walk around and watch"" sort of thing, no gameplay and no interaction with dinos, but you walk around and get scared the shit out of you by raptors anyway."

gaming,3dvb1u,Rahoolwho,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:43:51 2015 UTC,"Note that it does take about ten hours to get going at the start. The pacing is terrible, and they seem more focused on adding new dinosaurs than improving the game experience (not a criticism, as the game's still in development - just pointing it out).  There are plenty of better survival games that are much cheaper than ARK. Three hours playing The Forest ($10) is more of an experience than fifteen hours playing ARK, for example.  But ARK will probably catch up next year. It's not a risky buy, IMO. Some fun to be had already."

gaming,3dvb1u,Dlymanator,2,Mon Jul 20 11:29:07 2015 UTC,"I normally don't buy early access, certainly not alpha phase games.  But these are dinosaurs. I love dinosaurs.  The developers behind Ark are professionals that came together to create a startup company and a game they believe in. The amount of updates coming through is massive. The game, as it is, already works great and has enough challenge to keep me busy for several weeks, and there is so much more to come."
gaming,3dvb1u,WallusTheWalrus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:31:26 2015 UTC,"I haven't played all of them but it's leagues ahead of DayZ or H1Z1 IMO.  Dinosaurs are actually useful. You can tame them and put a saddle on anything bigger than you too ride it (everything from a T-Rex to a big Scorpion to a Pterodactyl to a Megaladon). They'll follow you around and attack your targets like an army. Certain dinos will gather certain resources at a faster rate than you can without them.  Crafting and base building system is all implemented. They're still adding new things as well.  There are endgame bosses that you can summon, so you actually have something to do with all the cool gear you craft. I wanna say there are 5-10 different bosses to summon but I am not sure. I'm hoping they add more PVE endgame stuff.  As long as your server is decent it performs really well. I'm playing on a private server and there are issues with lag every once in awhile but for the most part it runs really smooth. Private can servers have different rules set up so you can find a server that fits your play style.   The one complaint I have is it takes way too long to level up so eventually you get to the point where you are kinda grinding to get XP. Server owners can increase XP gain though.   And people aren't exaggerating when they talk about how often it's updated and how much they communicate and take feedback from the community. I don't mean to go all fanboy here but these devs are really doing Early Access how it should be done."

When I saw ARK come up on steam out of nowhere I thought it looked like (to be blunt) another cash grab from a couple guys working fresh out of college but I guess I was wrong.  Problem is I have researched so many of these Alpha survival games and had them all end up the same way (dead in the water) in the past that when ARK came along I just decided not to bother. I'll keep an eye on it now though, Im still shaky on early access after Star Forge fiasco :("

For some reason the gaming scene chooses to hold their events in I would say (in my opinion) very shitty locations. Just my two cents and I know alot of them would disagree with me. I think these locations are perhaps more community driven and are held in areas where locals can easily get into which is fine if they think that's better."

Anyone who enjoys that slot machine with graphics, needs to go watch the gamespot video they put together showing you exactly how this game is set up to reward players the same way pigeons were rewarded for pecking a certain spot on their cage and receiving a treat.  It's designed to keep players addicted with limited content and making them think they need the content.  By the time Destiny is all said and done, people will have wasted probably $500 on all the content, while I'll be playing all the games that come out that'll have more story in the first 5 minutes than the entire game of Destiny.  In 2015, to have players go read cards and not have some form of matchmaking for ALL the content in the game, just goes to show you how incredibly lazy developers have become.  i bought the game and season pass for $100 and feel totally ripped off.  They dumbed the game down and put the content that was already on my disc, behind paywalls... How that isn't illegal is beyond me.  People who aren't invested in the game in any kind of way, other than wasting literally hundreds of hours of their life, get so offended by people's opinions... They're addicted and don't realize it.  I can't imagine wasting that much time on a game.

Not gonna upload it since it just shows the bugs by the power supply. Gross.   But, I used basic spray paint to paint the body.  To clean it out, I just took apart the PS4 on a empty space where if any bugs crawled out, I was able to kill them instantly. Killed about 15 - 17 roaches. Missed about 1 or 2 so I researched on how long they go without food or water, and it's a week. So I just concealed it for a week and cleaned it out again.   The hard drive cover was scratched up and ugly. So I used Scrotch Brite to smooth it out. :) Video for reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31hhHEDIlj8  Any other questions?"

I'd have to stand directly in front of the console to even navigate the ui.   The console ejected discs randomly, common problem, easy fix.  I found out about the roaches when i popped open the PS4's hard drive cover and there they were. No tools needed for this action since you're allowed to change the HDD.   So, to fix all three problems. I just popped open the whole console. Cleaned out the roaches one by one. Found out that the bluetooth module was bent during shipping possible since seller shipped it in a careless manner and the console was probably dropped on that corner that the bluetooth sits at. So I just bent it back where it needed to be. The discs ejecting, all I had to do was twisted one of the consoles screwed and remove one of the rubbers found below the console. Easy.  :)"

gaming,3dsohw,SecretiveNarwhals,58,Sun Jul 19 06:21:01 2015 UTC,Because the leap from the 20 years you see above is the difference of square pixels with NO detail to life like looking graphics. They look almost real now. So in 20 years even if they look 100% real it still won't be as big of a difference as the gap between 1994-2015. There isn't as much room to improve. You get me?
gaming,3dsohw,GhostOfMozart,46,Sun Jul 19 06:36:49 2015 UTC,Then we need to work on animations and texture quality. That's how we can tell games from reality.

gaming,3dsohw,dkyguy1995,24,Sun Jul 19 07:21:58 2015 UTC,I think a critical contributor to realistic graphics is the lighting. It really is hard to pull life-like lighting and the mind can't be fooled easily. Check some videos from Unreal engine 4. Its lighting is spectacular and makes the graphics look more life like.
gaming,3dsohw,StanfordV,11,Sun Jul 19 07:15:47 2015 UTC,Absolutely true. Real-time global illumination in particular is on the rise and can give a huge boost to atmosphere:  Example 1  Example 2
gaming,3dsohw,c0xb0x,8,Sun Jul 19 07:37:39 2015 UTC,Texture quality can already look lifelike. They just don't in Wolfenstein. Alien isolation's textures for example are very high quality. Animations is where it's at. But I think that we're also getting there with motion capture.
gaming,3dsohw,LifeInvader04,8,Sun Jul 19 06:53:39 2015 UTC,"No, what we need work on is physics engines. Collision detection is the biggest facade in modern graphics.

Real time arbitrary concave collision detection is utterly nonexistant in modern physics engines and it's sad that we have such lifelike graphics only to be limited by extremely primitive  and fake physics (which most people never realize, because developers have become great at hiding it). /rant"

gaming,3dsohw,OtakuMecha,28,Sun Jul 19 06:25:22 2015 UTC,"And there will be tons of studios that purposefully hold back the realism of their characters until they can create something that matches a real human perfectly. For example, Pixar Animation studios purposefully doesn't go for as realistic as possible because they know if they get close but not quite there, it will fall until the uncanny valley for people. In the same way, video game devs might start stylizing their humans more once we reach a point where the only improvement we can make to the realism puts it into uncanny valley."
gaming,3dsohw,whatseiko1,13,Sun Jul 19 06:06:55 2015 UTC,Is there a source on that? I always thought they used that art style because its more cartoony for the kids and also easier to model and animate.

gaming,3dsohw,PatientIsTheNight,13,Sun Jul 19 04:41:38 2015 UTC,Pixar probably has no intention to ever be as realistic as possible. There isn't much of a point to 100% realistic animation in movies because it would take far less effort to film a live action movie with CGI effects.
gaming,3dsohw,OtakuMecha,8,Sun Jul 19 04:46:51 2015 UTC,Well yeah not 100% realistic. But I mean they could make it more lifelike than it is but they make a concious choice not to.
gaming,3dsohw,PatientIsTheNight,11,Sun Jul 19 04:52:34 2015 UTC,I'd still say it's more of an artistic choice than anything to do with the uncanny valley. Part of what makes Disney and Pixar movies so aesthetically pleasing is the smoother characters against the gorgeously detailed backgrounds.
gaming,3dsohw,OtakuMecha,8,Sun Jul 19 04:55:34 2015 UTC,"Well that's just what they said in the featurette. Though I suspect that was more talking specifically about Toy Story 3. Even aming Pixar movies, there are varying degrees of cartoony vs lifelike humans. Like you look at the humans in Up and they are very stylized and designed very cartoony but the humans in Toy Story 3 look more like real humans but slightly cartoonized.
