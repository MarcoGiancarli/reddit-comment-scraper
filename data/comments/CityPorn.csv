CityPorn,3e2l9m,Quaternions,5,Tue Jul 21 13:58:56 2015 UTC,"What's the definition of vintage in this case? Here's what I read:  To this day, PCCs continue to operate on the Mattapan Line, making the Line the longest continuous PCC operation in the country at almost 60 years! All of the PCCs that operate in Mattapan today are ""Post-War"" PCCs that have been beautifully repainted to match their appearance back when they were run by the MTA along a variety of streetcar lines all over Boston.  Mattapan PCC #3262 pictured following extensive restoration that was performed on all Mattapan PCCs starting in 1999 and finishing in the mid-2000s. The restoration brought #3262, as well as the entire Mattapan PCC fleet, back to its original 1940s/1950s appearance as a member of the MTA (not BERy, as you will see below) streetcar fleet.  Perhaps my impression is due to their expertly performed recent restoration, yet the fact alone that trolleys built in the mid-1940s are still running so reliably seventy years later in Boston and along revenue trolley lines across the country is a clear indicator that PCC streetcars were built to last. http://www.bostonstreetcars.com/trolley-types-of-boston.html"

CityPorn,3dqndm,crackanape,2,Sat Jul 18 22:47:27 2015 UTC,"Let's say the ticket costs $1000. It costs you $500 to stay somewhere for a week and go out and get around town. Those are on the high side, but just to be safe.  $1500 is $28/week you have to save for one year. For most people, that's definitely within reach. Just have to find some other things to save on - reduce your phone plan, cut out smoking or fancy coffee, make your own lunches, etc.  The main thing that stops people from traveling is the idea that they can't travel."
CityPorn,3dqndm,SpacemasterTom,2,Sun Jul 19 08:47:41 2015 UTC,"I get the idea. I actually have a plan to do this for Spain next year and I'll try to save everything I can because my current list of the countries I've been to is pretty embarrassing. As for Amsterdam & the rest of Europe, tough luck, the best I can do right now is Graz, Austria. I am from Europe, but from a country so poor even Greece had to donate a couple of millions to it."

You have no idea how annoying it is for us to constantly hear comments about it possibly not being ""safe"". It's been 20+ years since the war. We have our own countries now, our teams are competing in the Olympics, World Cup, international sports etc. We're not 3rd world shitholes. We've rebuilt and moved on. Nothing is ever perfect but we're thriving.  I'm sure this is coming off as hostile and ""over the top"" but it's borderline insulting to hear comments like this because we're a very proud people and live in incredibly beautiful countries that were devastated by several wars and yet we always recover and always will. Come visit, see as much as you can, don't let the unnecessary stigma discourage you from a wonderful life experience because I can tell you right now it's probably safer over there than any given big city in the U.S.  /rant.

The architecture is so overwhelming in the inner city/old city and its also very, very cheap to stay here - at least for a Dane like me; food, transport and museums are unbelievably cheap and the people are really friendly and helpful. They also speak English very well but it seems as though people outside of Prague aren't very good at English."

You can walk to everything that's worth a visit but if you like you can purchase a ticket for both busses, metro and trams for a whole day for only ~110 korunas.  The zoo is worth a visit - it's really great. It's a bit hard to get there but it's a very nice zoo - top ten in the world I've heard - and it's really large. The polar bears were the only animals that I didn't think ha enough space and were the only animals ones that ran around in the same circles all day (in the zoo in Eastern Berlin a lot of the animals did that). It was about 30¬∞C today and it's going to be even warmer tomorrow - it's really hot here if you come from a cold place.  Don't live in Prague 1 - we've rented a nice, big apartment but it's really noisy at night because if billions of huge groups of people on bar crawls every night. The windows in the apartment doesn't block any sound and I think it's because Prague 1 is under UNESCO so there are strict rules on what you can do to the buildings.  If you're in Prague to drink, discard the above - you probably won't care ;)  Hope you'll have a nice stay - I'm really enjoy if it so far :)"

Go do those paddleboats in the river (rentals from Slovansky ostrov island)  Concert/outdoor bar on Strelecky Ostrov Island. Awesome views at sunset  Letna Beer garden at Letensk√© sady (also awesome views).  Amazing views from the small trails around Hanavsky pavilon (best view of ALL the bridges) Climb up to Basilika  svateho and walk the walls surrounding it (N√°rodn√≠ kulturn√≠ pam√°tka Vy≈°ehrad)  Go eat at traditional czech restaurants where locals go. Although tourist restaurants are still sort of cheap compared to western standards, the local places are MUCH cheaper, MUCH better food, MUCH more food.

There used to be a normal neighbourhood there, which got completely demolished to construct the North-South Connection (connecting the two stations Brussels North and South with a tunnel, more info here.)

CityPorn,3dbihb,THRUSSIANBADGER,9,Wed Jul 15 00:02:58 2015 UTC,So in the 14th century Novgorod was one of Europes largest cities.  The city broke away from Muscovy in the 1300s and then suffered a famine killing a large part of its population and then came back to Muscovy.  Then in the 1500's another famine hit the city and a few years later Ivan the Terrible started the massacre of Novgorod where he killed thousands of the common people deported the cities merchant elite and nobility to Moscow and Yaroslavl.  During WW2 Germany had full control over the city and destroyed almost all of its historic monuments.  In 1940 there were over 2500 stone buildings in the city centre and after the war less than 40 remained.  Over the years the Soviet government had slowly been restoring all of the buildings but the city will never return to the greatness that it achieved in the 14th century.

Not just for aesthetics, but for resident health, temperature moderation and the environment. It's also important that they're scattered throughout the city as well and not just localized in some large park.  Like the trees in the photo are part of a 19th century design plan called 'The Emerald Necklace', whose goal was to mix greenery with everyday life up and down the boulevards."

That's when we went because there was an international research summit and that was the date for it, but the amount of humidity and heat was absolutely insane. But the city was really beautiful and I still loved it despite being in a constant state of heat delirium (I'm exaggerating here but only slightly).   I figure you would get to enjoy the Cheonggyecheon a lot more than during the winter if you went during the summer, and I'd presume the night life would feel more lively. I'm actually considering going back either during Autumn or the early summer at some point, because I just loved it there. The Koreans are awesome people and the city's architecture is amazing."

CityPorn,3cmhpx,Ahf66,17,Thu Jul 9 04:50:38 2015 UTC,"It's hard to define downtown in Tokyo, but Shinjuku / Shibuya are two of the main centers and are not in the picture (it'd be about 90¬∞ on the left). Tokyo Tower is missing too, it'd be just on the right of the picture. Shinagawa is missing.  What you see is basically the Roppongi / Asakasa / Hibiya / Nagatatcho area, which are far from being major areas."

CityPorn,3cmhpx,Berxwedan,8,Thu Jul 9 12:25:54 2015 UTC,"There's no real downtown - the city is actually a province on its own, with 26 cities (or wards) in it. Shinjuku is probably the most downtownish, but it depends also on what you're looking for. If it's less business and more shipping and entertainment, then it's probably Shibuya. And then there's also ikebukuro, roppongi, ginza, and more and more. Not all 26 are skyscrapers or whatever everywhere, but its all tokyo, and no single place is the de facto center."

Try opening Tokyo on google maps, zoom in random places - even in the middle - and you will see small cosy neighbourhoods.  Used to be you could drop the little street view man at random seemingly grey areas in the Tokyo satellite map, and 9/10 times you'd end up in some nice little areas with trees, but Google have changed the maps... now you just end up in those panoramas of temples if you try dropping the man from high altitude..."

CityPorn,3cj8bf,simongoldberg,18,Wed Jul 8 11:47:34 2015 UTC,"People always seem to underestimate how big and diverse New Zealand actually is, so I recommend not spending too much time in Auckland and having a look at some places you will want to spend some time in before you arrive.   Northland is amazing, albeit very warm, around Christmas, the Hawkes Bay is amazing for 'alternative' types and winos, New Plymouth is a little world of its own, doing its own rad things, taupo is great for outdoorsy things. Wellington is just a generally awesome city, especially on a (rare) warm sunny day. Picton and Malborough sounds are fucken incredible and breathtaking, Christchurch has its own brand new identity but also sombre tone (I don't want to speak for chchneans too much, as I haven't spent much time there), and Queenstown is just plain beautiful -  you can't appreciate why they call the ranges there the remarkables until you see them in person.   So many amazing unique places that you could spend a week or more in, so make sure you figure out what you want to do before you come!   Don't go to Hamilton.   Sorry for the unsolicited rant, I'm in the UK and may be feeling a tad homesick right now :p"
CityPorn,3cj8bf,ThisCharmingMan89,8,Wed Jul 8 17:08:31 2015 UTC,"Adding:  Coromandel is gorgeous and has great, very isolated beaches, but the roads are harrowing.  Queenstown is indeed amazing, but there's a lot more to Otago and Canterbury‚Äîtake a few days to go through it.  Fiordland is every bit as good as advertised; the sort of landscape to ""make you want to burst into spontaneous applause,"" as Douglas Adams put it.  A lot of people tend to skip Dunedin, but I think it's definitely worth going to for a ""recharge"" after exploring all the wilderness of the South Island (good shops, good dining, and if you happen through it during a film festival, a film at the historic Regent Theatre is not to be missed).  Plus the harbour and peninsula are beautiful and full of penguins, seals, and albatross.  The surfing is pretty good, too.  Lastly, if you want to feel like you've reached the end of the earth, go through the Catlins in Southland. It's enchanting in a way that's hard to put one's finger on.   Don't go to Hamilton.    LOL.  This is sound advice."
CityPorn,3cj8bf,designated_shitter,2,Wed Jul 8 19:35:21 2015 UTC,"I can't believe I left out coromandel. Spent 5 days up there camping before moving to the UK, only the second time I've been up there but it is just unreal.   And absolutely, Canterbury and Otago are huge, awesome places. New Zealand has so much to offer, I was trying to get through the main 'hotspots' throughout the country to show the diversity, but even throughout, there's so much more to see. I lived in NZ for 25 years and didn't even scratch the surface of things to see.  And I've been to Dunedin once when I was quite young, but didn't want to mention it as I really don't know enough to decide what's worth to see. Thanks for sharing!"

There is a large amount of foreign ownership of properties in Auckland, a situation that our Government chooses to ignore. I kid you not we get buyers without residency or citizenship who come over here, buy 20-30 homes at a time (outbidding local residents struggling to stay afloat in this ridiculous property market) - they then either rent them out or simply leave them empty, fly back home and sit and wait for profit!

CityPorn,3cazme,mandelbratwurst,11,Mon Jul 6 20:41:42 2015 UTC,"It's surprising how easy it is to get around. I was only there for about three months but it generally felt like I could get between any two points in a maximum of about an hour, usually closer to 45 mins. There are a lot of trains, subways and buses.  As far as government is concerned, Tokyo is an interesting outlier in Japan precisely because of it's size. Japan is mostly made up of prefectures (similar to states in the US) and then there's various subdivisions for regions, cities, areas within cities, et al. Tokyo however is the only ""Metropolitan Prefecture"" in Japan where the ""city"" is the prefecture with a governtment, and is then further broken down into smaller 'cities' and districts which have their own elected officials, etc.  I haven't been all over the world but I feel confident in saying that there is really nothing like Tokyo anywhere else in the world.

Where a 30 km drive is nothing in those countries, the amount of people, businesses, restaurants, attractions you pass in the same span in Japan (outside of Hokkaido) is mind-boggling.   Tokyo is a prefectural-level entity (similar to a state-level government in the U.S.), and is broken up into 23 wards and several other cities that are collectively known as Tokyo (similar to the boroughs of New York). None of them have more than a million people, so it's not as impossible to govern as it seems."

CityPorn,3cazme,Paper-Cut,4,Mon Jul 6 22:29:01 2015 UTC,Probably around 1500 per ticket depending on what month you fly honestly. You can rent on airbnb and stay for cheaper than a hotel. Food is also cheaper than you would expect for the quality.

CityPorn,3cazme,Paper-Cut,2,Tue Jul 7 03:31:20 2015 UTC,Few questions:  Are you comfortable doing a home stay in Japan? It's like air bnb.  How many nights do you want to be there?  How many cities?  Do you have any rewards programs for any airline? I paid $975.11 last month at full fare as I don't have any points with Singapore.
CityPorn,3cazme,Arcitct,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:06:14 2015 UTC,"A home stay would be fine. Would be a better way to connect to the culture too I imagine.   Not sure on how many cities - need to pick up a travel book. My girl is a sushi and amine can, so maybe somewhere in Tokyo that centers on that?   Most likely 5 days minimum. We want enough time to cover a lot of ground.   I don't have an airline credit card..not a bad idea though. What do you use? I have a Discover and a Citibank credit card right now, both give cash rewards."

CityPorn,3cazme,Arcitct,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:05:28 2015 UTC,"For myself and my SO I was assuming $1600 in airfare, maybe $1400 for hotel for a week, and then $3000 in spending money for food and shopping (though we probably could get by spending less, always nice to have extra for unforeseen problems)  So $6,000?  Never having been there, so my impression of prices is very fuzzy.  I haven't done a ton of research either, since the money isn't here yet."
CityPorn,3cazme,Alorha,2,Tue Jul 7 16:06:33 2015 UTC,"Your airfare will likely be higher. Singapore seems to have the lowest cost direct flight.

Also, I didn't listen to my girlfriend who wisely recommended to charge the camera battery before going there. This is the last shot I was able to get, and the only one that was usable.   I used the Live Composite mode of the camera.

CityPorn,3c8seo,dj_8track,12,Mon Jul 6 05:47:00 2015 UTC,"In 1894, a 14-story building was built which was new to that era. People wondered how it would fare in a fire or if it was structurally sound. In order to keep the people calm, DC passed an act that would limit the height of buildings for ""safety"" reasons.   As time and technology progressed, sky-scrapers became more structurally sound and fire services got better at fighting fires. However, the people there didn't like the skylines seen in other cities, so they limited the height of a building to the width of the street it was built on plus twenty (90ft wide street = 110ft tall building)."

CityPorn,3c5ap0,workerbotsuperhero,4,Sun Jul 5 01:08:11 2015 UTC,"Most buildings going up in downtown Montreal these days are residential and hotels towers, because the office vacancy rate has seen a big increase recently. It has risen due to multiple factor including: the construction of new office towers downtown, the conversion of old industrial buildings in other parts of the cities, as well as poor job growth (partly attributable to austerity policies from the provincial government.).   In downtown montreal, most of the recent and ongoing construction is concentrated around the Bell Center (seen on the right hand of this post's picture).    What are those new buildings going up?   Here are renders for the projects going up on the picture (from left to right):   Icone Condos (40 & 27 floors) Roccabella Condos (40 & 40 floors) L'Avenue Condos (50 floors) Tour des Canadiens 1 (50 floors) YUL Condos & Holiday Inn Hotel (40, 40 & 37 floors)    And here are most of their heights compared:  http://i.imgur.com/yvmTn2K.jpg  This picture illustrates the Montreal's urban development plan for that part of city over the next decade or so.  If you have other questions about Montreal, feel free to ask!"
CityPorn,3c5ap0,DeepStuffRicky,3,Sun Jul 5 02:31:52 2015 UTC,"Do they still have that weird law where no skyscraper can be taller than Mt. Royal?  Montreal is my favorite city in the whole world. When I was a little girl in the early 70s it was the NYC of Canada. Toronto had not yet become the major thing it is today, most of the traffic at that time was headed south to Buffalo and Detroit, not north to TO like now. The language problem and Quebec's weird politics have reduced Montreal's status a bit but it's still my favorite."
CityPorn,3c5ap0,DeepStuffRicky,3,Sun Jul 5 16:42:06 2015 UTC,"Do they still have that weird law where no skyscraper can be taller than Mt. Royal?   Yes, Montreal still has a rule that no building can be taller than 200 meters or rise above 232,5 metres above sea level. (Mt. Royal's, height)   But to be honest, it's kind of useless because it has been more than twenty years since new towers have even come close or are actually restricted by that height limit. To my knowledge, the only tower affected by the restriction was the 47-floor 1250 Ren√©-L√©vesque tower, which was initially designed to be 275m tall. (72 floors)  But now in 2015, the needs for office tenants have changed (not just in MTL) as they now prefer larger floor plates, which means towers are shorter for the same amount of square footage. So it's very unlikely that Montreal will have a need for 200m office towers in the foreseeable future.   For now, the tallest new tower proposed is a (gorgeous) 180m high office building. I really hope it goes forward.  As for condo towers, the market conditions in Montreal hardly justify building more than 50 floors high, so the mountain's height restriction isn't a problem for them either.  But apart from Mt. Royal height, there are several other height restrictions that are meant to protect some ""view cones"", from and to the mountain, as well as establish a predefined curve for the skyline's silhouette.

I don't know if the same reasoning applied to the Aon (originally Standard Oil) Building."

CityPorn,3boeu1,basilect,3,Wed Jul 1 08:19:11 2015 UTC,"Earthquakes aren't an issue as in the building falling down, but they are an issue in terms of making a building economically viable. Making a tall building capable of standing up to earthquakes is expensive and for most of LA's history it was cheaper just to move outward instead of upward."

CityPorn,3bmzog,thisisalili,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:24:57 2015 UTC,Agree. Just hope that those mountains are not volcanic.
CityPorn,3bmzog,onizuka11,6,Tue Jun 30 22:28:43 2015 UTC,"They are not volcanic. They were formed by the shifting of tectonic plates. The Wasatch Fault runs along the east bench of SLC. Unfortunately, the SLC area is overdue for a big earthquake, and as you can see in this picture, the valley that we have built our cities on (I'm a local) is actually an ancient lake bed. In the event of a serious earthquake we can expect serious damage due to liquefaction of that ancient lake bed. Some areas in the valley are built on solid rock, and less vulnerable to an earthquake, but nevertheless, it's a big concern here."

CityPorn,3bmzog,delaboots,2,Wed Jul 1 14:25:17 2015 UTC,"I'm no geologist, but I'll give it a shot. The Salt Lake Valley is actually a dried up lake bed from the ancient Lake Bonneville. As water flowed in and out of the area, sand and soil was deposited onto that lakebed. Now that Lake Bonneville is long gone,  that soil is nice and firm and perfectly capable of supporting structures like buildings and roads. In an earthquake, however, that soil becomes much less stable and less capable of supporting those structures.  Clear as mud? ;)  Here's an article from the Utah Geological Survey that explains this in depth and includes a cool map that illustrates the liquefaction potential of the Salt Lake Valley. Basically, the closer you get to the Great Salt Lake (the remnant of Lake Bonneville), the higher the potential for liquefaction."

It's actually about 2X the population of NY. just over 25 million, by some measures the second largest city in the world.

CityPorn,3bayo9,stufoonoob,20,Sat Jun 27 18:28:20 2015 UTC,"Busan population: 3.4 million  LA population: 3.8 million   I have honestly never heard of Busan. I find it simply amazing that there are so many other cities in the world that are as big as (and bigger than) the biggest cities in the US - and I had no idea they existed. Twenty cities bigger than New York. Sixty-four cities bigger than LA.  Completely different civilizations, full of millions of people, all living their lives, working their jobs, handling daily stresses, enjoying the night life, raising their families, rooting on their sports teams, and doing the same things we do in our own cities. All of these different societies all mirroring each other in so many ways, yet separated by thousands of miles in complete ignorance of each other. ""Amazing"" doesn't even do justice to how thinking about this makes me feel."
CityPorn,3bayo9,shiift,7,Sat Jun 27 20:59:31 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the Korean cities feel very western. Most Americans and Europeans could live there with relatively little trouble (many people also speak English).  It's really amazing how far South Korea has come since the Korean War, especially for such a small country."
CityPorn,3bayo9,SausserTausser,3,Sun Jun 28 00:28:54 2015 UTC,"I feel like I'm all over this thread, but this place is very western in a lot of ways, and very not in another.  I'm from the US, but I've travelled Europe a lot. You definitely cannot rely on the ""most people speak really good English!"" thing here. In Berlin, I could go to almost any shop or restaurant, and at least one person would be a fluent English speaker. If you go to a restaurant in Korea, it's not unlikely that nobody will speak English well enough to communicate with you, and you'll get handed a pictureless menu that you will not be able to read even remotely phonetically until you learn Hangul. Walking into a shop and asking someone if they speak English, and having them respond with a confident ""yes"" is like Christmas come early.  The culture is entirely different too. Manners are different, expectations are different, there is a hyper-respect for ones elders that is so strong that it is even a core component to the structure of the Korean language, a concept that absolutely blows my mind as someone raised in a meritocratic Western society.  I am not struggling to live here, but it's definitely not without its challenges. I know expats who live here pretty much entirely confined to their expat friend circles, with diets of American fast food. I should say that it isn't difficult to survive here, but to truly live and thrive in the city of Busan is a different story."
CityPorn,3bayo9,SausserTausser,2,Sun Jun 28 06:11:15 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind, Busan is also EXTREMELY dense compared to LA. Theres a lot packed into a little space.

In 2000 Korea revised how to write because there was constant confusion on different sounding consonants.   The city is called Busan Î∂ÄÏÇ∞ and in Korean, it's a solid b instead of a p. There's another  actual distinctly p sounding character „Öç. So the old way created in 1959 made Î∂ÄÏÇ∞ / Ìë∏ÏÇ∞ (now written Busan / Pusan) it exactly the same word.
