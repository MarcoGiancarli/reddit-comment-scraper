trailerparkboys,3e2uuk,sw1ff2,5,Tue Jul 21 16:26:30 2015 UTC,"He sheds his shirt as a defense mechanism, like those lizards that can detach their tails."
trailerparkboys,3e2uuk,Mikesapien,5,Tue Jul 21 18:49:45 2015 UTC,Theres always a chance he'll come back :D
trailerparkboys,3e2uuk,gravewisdom45,4,Tue Jul 21 17:01:38 2015 UTC,I dont think there is...he got a real shitty end of the stick...a lot of people did...some stood up for themselves others didn't.....trevor and ray both left for the same reasons! I doubt we see that either of them ever again on the show....just from  the blogs they have written and released to the public it sounds like they are done...even though it was Clattenbergs fault they are probably just done with the show in general by now. If I can find the blogs they released to the public I will link them here for you to read. Very interesting stuff actually. They both loved the show to pieces but sick of being walked all over. Trevor actually left with one year term left on his contract. Clattenberg actually never sued hin for it but corey lost out in the season of work and pay because of it.
trailerparkboys,3e2uuk,DJ_Lud,5,Tue Jul 21 17:11:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I recall reading something along those likes.  MJ being bullied by the execs, a lot of people who weren't 'the boys' got this treatment.  I think  they are all on good terms with the boys themselves, but probably want to move on.  I like the Corey/Jacob thing they created...it'd be an interesting storyline if Trevor came back because Corey would have his buddy again and Jacob has Trin and Mo.  Now that they are on Netflix, I'd love for some guys to come back...Ray would be fantastic!"
trailerparkboys,3e2uuk,MogMcKupo,4,Tue Jul 21 17:16:22 2015 UTC,Oh i totally agree! Id love nohig more than season 10 epi 1 Trevor shows up walkin by himself into the park...I think we would all lose our shit! Id prolly be close to tears...i miss the skinny alien armed fuck! He was always one of my favourite characters on the show...
trailerparkboys,3e2uuk,DJ_Lud,4,Tue Jul 21 17:23:11 2015 UTC,"Way she goes, Bubs, Way she goes.  THAT DOESN'T EVEN MAKE SENSE, RAY! FAACK!  (yeah, I was rewatching it, and the Corey Trevor dynamic just never was there with Jacob...I felt like they were stepbrothers who were like that movie ""ARE WE BEST FRIENDS NOW!?"""
trailerparkboys,3e2uuk,MogMcKupo,3,Tue Jul 21 17:27:22 2015 UTC,Shit I didn't realise! Trev was one of my favourite characters :/
trailerparkboys,3e2uuk,gravewisdom45,0,Tue Jul 21 17:40:09 2015 UTC,"I don't think Netflix would fuck them around like Showcase did. With Smith, Tremblay, and Wells now owning the show, they could probably negotiate to bring them back. Don't see why they wouldn't, considering the popularity of the characters."
trailerparkboys,3e2uuk,Mikesapien,0,Tue Jul 21 18:49:10 2015 UTC,"It had nothig to do with show case...it had to do with Clattenberg makin false promises to everybody about pay and whatever else. Trevor actually had 3 other jobs ontop of acting in the show. Neither Ray or Trevor said anything about show case!! Show case had absolutely nothig to do with ray and/or trevor leaving the show! I dont doubt the three boys have asked them boh probably many times in  the past 2/3 years to come back...but people get busy in life and get ontop of other things abd like tk stand by their principles and maybe that they aren't willing to give up. It honestly would be so amazing so see them back, but i very doubt we will ever get to see either ray or trevor back on the show."
trailerparkboys,3e2uuk,DJ_Lud,2,Tue Jul 21 19:33:16 2015 UTC,You gotta hope the personal beefs get settled and astronaut cock comes back.
trailerparkboys,3e2uuk,GarthVolbeck,2,Tue Jul 21 17:07:07 2015 UTC,No doubt! It would be awesome! Since clattmberg is gone you think they would of been back for season 8 or even 9....season 10 is alrdy done filiming too...havent heard jack shit of either of hem being back...but if I was the boys and one of them  came back i woudlnt release that info anyways id want to keep it a surprise!

trailerparkboys,3e40yg,wwyzzerdd,-1,Tue Jul 21 20:25:39 2015 UTC,New owners....new scene...netflix. yes ive read it i know everyhi g that hapoen to him....but things change and its just curiousity! Maybe now that cwrtai .people are ot of the picure he can rerurn happily.with increased pay? Its a question thats all! Relax dude...just lookin for maybe a more recent update of why not to return or whatever...
trailerparkboys,3e40yg,RandomBackfire,0,Tue Jul 21 20:27:36 2015 UTC,"THink about it like this...  You have a job.  Over time you realize you are under appreciated and under paid.  You talk with the owners about a raise and some respect but that doesn't get you anything.  So you have enough of it and tell everyone literally ""fuck off"".   Some time passes, a few of the managers leave (but most of the original crew is still there).  You go back and ask for your job back with a raise.  How do you think that will go?"

trailerparkboys,3dx3py,gakbds,4,Mon Jul 20 06:46:54 2015 UTC,"I actually think Farrelly will very easily tap into the most extreme bits of their newest episodes-- loud, gross, over-the-top stuff. But I don't see him bringing back the feel of the older episodes. I could see maybe someone like David Wain or Eric Wareheim bringing back the more subtle, hyper real feel of the first few seasons. Has Farrelly ever done anything subtle?  FWIW I'm pumped for the new season but if you're hoping for a return to the old seasons with Snoop Dogg and Tom Arnold joining the cast, you should give up now."
trailerparkboys,3dx3py,mshelbo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:11:39 2015 UTC,Agreed. The focus should be kn the boys and other residents. Hopefully Snoop and Tom will fit in delicately and not be forced in.

FOR FREE. Open bar.  Anyway, my friend and I were chilling with Lucy Decoutere by the bar talking about Michael Jackson and what a dipshit he is, when out of nowhere, Sam comes up to us.  ""Heyyy guys, how's everyone doing,"" he exclaimed reaking of bbq sauce. As we began to introduce ourselves, he interrupted us, ""I'll be right back!"" he tells us.  An afterthought just about 45 minutes later he comes back to us with a 6-pack of some random micro-brew.  ""Sorry boys, I forgot my shiit,"" he says with the dumbest look on his face. We look at him. He looks back at us. We couldn't figure out for the life of us why he bought beer for an open bar party. He truly is bizarre in real life.  I have sooo many stories, I'd love to do an AMA if enough people were interested. This particular night was sooo greasy I can't even tell you. Well, yes actually I can."

Could be explained away that maybe now Randy's settling down, and wants more of a life partner in Jim, instead of just sex. Or, could just be earlier Jim was going through some physical things, and Bobandy wasn't questioning Jim's love/attraction for him.   But, maybe we're thinking about it too much."

Also a few of us were all chillin' in the parking lot afterwards listening to Lahey drunken ramble and T freestyle. But it was a smaller type bar, not a theatre so I think it depends on the location.

I did it last year and at first I was a little put off by the cost (I believe it was $75) but it was worth every penny. Everyone was in character and it was basically like a 5 minute episode of TPB with me co-starring.   Randy said ""I like your shirt"" to me, and Ricky responded ""Are you fuckin' hittin' on him, Randy? Right in front of Lahey, too?"". Randy of course responded with a ""FRIG OFF, RICK!"". Julian started talking some shit, Bubbles joined in. I was fuckin' losin' my mind. One of the best moments of my life.   They take you in by yourself (or whoever you're there with). You hand your cell phone to some guy who works for them and he just starts taking pics for you with the boys while you hang out with them for a bit. Definitely fuckin' do it if you get the chance.   Here's one of the pics. I told Bubs to ""feed me one"" and he obliged, along with everyone else  I also managed to get selected by Randy to come on stage to be one of the fake Santas for Ricky"

trailerparkboys,3dim29,BakerBalls,3,Thu Jul 16 19:19:53 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, it's per person. But this is pretty much a possible once in a lifetime type thing. TPB is my favorite comedy show ever and these guys have brought me a lifetime of laughter. All I do is quote the show with my buddies constantly. I've watched the entire series probably 7 times over.

trailerparkboys,3dixa2,Goose_TpGn,3,Fri Jul 17 01:59:11 2015 UTC,I don't think they did voices for actual named characters in the episode. I remember bc I was super bummed lol. I'm pretty sure they do voices of Robb Well's character's Canadian mafia.

trailerparkboys,3diejd,lorne1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:59:52 2015 UTC,"The Showcase seasons were shot on digital video-tape, which is what gave it that distinct look."
trailerparkboys,3diejd,buhcheery,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:37:22 2015 UTC,I think for one season Swearnet should run out of funding and have to resort to the old cameras. Just for one season...  (maybe)

trailerparkboys,3desi2,the_Ex_Lurker,7,Wed Jul 15 21:00:16 2015 UTC,"I forget where I saw this, but apparently the crash was unintentional. Hence the awesome reactions."
trailerparkboys,3desi2,thefisherman1961,6,Thu Jul 16 00:23:57 2015 UTC,I always thought it was either unintentional or improvised.  I find it hard to believe it was scripted because they obviously only had one shot to get that right since the car was totally fucked after that.
trailerparkboys,3desi2,Soperos,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:24:44 2015 UTC,"The response might be recorded before the scene, since we have heard it and seen Bubbles in the scene not screaming."
trailerparkboys,3desi2,Soperos,2,Thu Jul 16 11:39:27 2015 UTC,I think they're almost always recorded separately because Bubbles is on screen at times when Donny's also screaming.

He mostly steals stuff when it can be turned into money. Or when he just goes in to buy some patches for Trin and all of sudden his gun is out which is no big deal but the business-dummy freaks out and he might as well rob them."

trailerparkboys,3ddb1j,richdoe,4,Thu Jul 16 03:38:26 2015 UTC,He did steal liquor before... This is not a Robbery we're here to take some money for charity and some liquor.

trailerparkboys,3ddb1j,CEONeil,42,Thu Jul 16 03:53:54 2015 UTC,This could be a pretty funny sub plot for this season. Ricky has all new clothes that are covered in Tags because he stole them. And they always are going off when Ricky enters and exits stores.

trailerparkboys,3ddb1j,bardyard,6,Wed Jul 15 19:40:19 2015 UTC,"Ricky can handle one thought at a time, throw 2 or 3 at em, fucking trainwreck"
trailerparkboys,3ddb1j,izziev,14,Wed Jul 15 22:23:20 2015 UTC,"See, I've noticed this, but thought it was a certain character quirk. Like, ""These clothes will work, I don't need new ones"" 90% of the time, but 10% he gets fed up, and wants something new... but not enough to go get any. Plus, we always see them go into grocery stores or convenience stores, never clothing stores(that I can remember anyway) so maybe they have a rule about it. Or it was one of those background stories about how he tried once but the alarm went off and he didn't know why cause of a tag or something."
trailerparkboys,3ddb1j,lord_kmz,5,Wed Jul 15 16:39:05 2015 UTC,I think those clothes where just the coolest  you could have atm and still are for Ricky (and Corey/Trevor). Since they are hard to find these days he just skips the rest.
trailerparkboys,3ddb1j,izziev,3,Wed Jul 15 19:43:35 2015 UTC,This is also a good point.
trailerparkboys,3ddb1j,jalepeno,8,Wed Jul 15 21:58:56 2015 UTC,"Ricky inevitably does a lot of stealing, and some taking out the trash, but his real skills lie in growing dope and talking to cops. He isn't good at anything else. Mostly the boys are trying to avoid jail and clothes aren't going to make them any money. They do have a no stealing from the park rule (mostly) so that rules out the only place we would likely see clothes unattended."
trailerparkboys,3ddb1j,dubs2112,5,Wed Jul 15 19:47:22 2015 UTC,"He isn't good at anything else.   Not true. He can also cook good too, but it takes all of his mental abilities. I've seen him get pulled into a trance by bacon sizzling."
trailerparkboys,3ddb1j,folderol,3,Thu Jul 16 03:48:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if you steal a BBQ half the people in the fucking park are going to want one.  You steal some pants you may not find anyone that they fit and that they want at the same time.  Still doesn't explain why he doesn't steal his own clothes.  But the things he wears, where would you even find stuff like that except at a thrift store where they're super cheap and how would he go into a department store in track pants and come out and nobody noticed his upgrade."

trailerparkboys,3dg68g,WarriorHealer,6,Thu Jul 16 02:37:47 2015 UTC,"I went to the Montreal show a year or 2 ago and it was so bad that the boys had to tell the crowd (in character...) to chill and listen. Drunk hecklers kept screaming ""Swayze"" and ""Reveen"" or other shit constantly. Funny at first, bullish after 10 minutes. I lost it a couple of times and screamed at the hecklers to stop, most people seemed to agree. The show wasn't enjoyable because of it, which is too bad because the script and acting was top notch but was interrupted every fucking minute. At the end Lahey came to the mic to announce that Don't legalize it was coming (or something like that), he seemed annoyed and a bit pissed, understandably. Not sure if it's always like this, anybody else had a similar experience?"

The audience had great burst-out timing, wasn't annoying at all.   2013 Xmas Tour was in a major arena, the crowd turned into like some kinda drunken Greasy Horror Picture Show audience times ten. It was fucked. Fuckin' way she goes.   The one great common denominator was the partying in the parking lots. TPBers come prepared :)   We never did the meet-n-greets."

People were so high by the intermission that i could hear people snoring from all of the dabs. There was a few people that were yelling annoying things ""This is on Netflix"" is the one that pissed me off the most. I mean they did release the tour on netflix a few months before, but i refused to watch just in case they re used the material for the tour. It was Denver so obviously lots and lots of ""freedom"" in the air. Wasnt able to get meet and greet, but they sold autographed pictures of the boys for $50 each at the merch booth. Jeez, Denver was one hell of a fucking trip boys, let me tell ya."

trailerparkboys,3crgna,PatMcRotch210,3,Fri Jul 10 14:41:41 2015 UTC,"I've bought the subscription a handful of times over the last couple of years. Is it worth it? Imo buy a month, watch all the shows then wait for a few months for more content to come out.

trailerparkboys,3crgna,TheAlmightyD,3,Fri Jul 10 09:30:57 2015 UTC,"Swearnet is still in its infancy, so there's not a ton of content yet.

Not much going on right now but the last three weeks there's been TPB's content every day. Liquor Stories with Lahey is worth the sub alone.  Not really into the other shows without the boys/Lahey except Off World Cookery which was hilarious. Hope that comes back for S2.

trailerparkboys,3colbc,dnap123,2,Thu Jul 9 19:23:40 2015 UTC,Agreed that the X-Mas special should be watched after season 4. Lots of little details are revealed and it's much more interesting to discover them once you're familiar with the characters.

Even TPB: The Movie is in the timeline even if not canon - they are acting in their own universe, based on the theatrical trailer where they do auditions as the boys.

Edit: Not Cyrus but a similar character that's inspired by him"
trailerparkboys,3cm2hm,Gabriel_NDG,2,Thu Jul 9 05:56:46 2015 UTC,Then why does Ricky act like Ray is dead?  There's really no continuity between the movies and the show
trailerparkboys,3cm2hm,BigSeth,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:56:52 2015 UTC,He's acting like that because Ray did life insurance fraud that got him 11000$. He's protecting him that's all.

She got that charge from robbing a man for his prescription drugs.     In 2010, Woods was sentenced as a youthful offender to probation for the 2009 felony charges, which involved robbing a man of prescription drugs in Palm Beach Gardens.  After four probation violations, a judge in May 2013 ordered Woods to enter a six-month residential substance abuse treatment program, followed by two years of probation and other terms.  Woods then was warned it was likely her last chance to avoid a lengthy prison sentence.  Then from November 2013 to February, a Lauderdale Lakes-based probation officer filed reports listing more probation violations. One was a failure to take a drug test and provide an itinerary for court-approved travel Nov. 9-12 to attend a wedding in Monroe County.  A judge signed an arrest warrant Nov. 12, citing 10 probation offenses, including: violating curfew; associating with someone ""engaged in criminal activity""; lying to the probation officer; failing to complete 10 public service hours during three months; and failing to pay a total of more than $4,700 in probation costs.   The cookie thing happened before this."

trailerparkboys,3c1yn8,mike413,4,Sat Jul 4 01:35:03 2015 UTC,"Here in the US you don't even need to be hooked up to anything, you just need to register your vehicle as an RV."
trailerparkboys,3c1yn8,Bigfrostynugs,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:18:01 2015 UTC,"Turns out the answer for rvs is:   It depends.  If the RV is parked in a campground, a park on private property or at a private home, then it is considered to be a “domicile” and not a vehicle, rendering open container laws irrelevant. You can drink in the RV as long as you are not the driver and you have no plans on driving the vehicle while or shortly after drinking.  If the RV is traveling on the road, then open container laws apply to not only the driver, but to the passengers as well. However, it is rare that a traffic stop will result in passengers being cited or being arrested while imbibing as that would require consent to search the RV and that is not often given.  An exception to permission being given for searches is when the driver is going to camp on public lands. Then the ranger or law enforcement can demand to inspect your RV and they may cite or arrest someone who is violation of alcohol laws. Refrigerated alcohol, even in open containers, will be treated differently than open containers found on tables, benches or sleeping areas of an RV.   source"

trailerparkboys,3bz5od,nappiestapparatus,18,Fri Jul 3 10:32:17 2015 UTC,"Well, to me it seemed implied that Jacob was only a teenager (like 17-18) when Trin was little. Sure, the actor looked older, but Jacob was basically a high school kid working those small jobs that Ricky kept getting him fired from at the time. It seems like a big age difference at that particular age, but as adults that's really not a big deal."
trailerparkboys,3bz5od,saturnshexagon,6,Fri Jul 3 12:47:40 2015 UTC,I remember Jacob writing his grade 10 exam and getting kicked out with Cyrus for cheating. I think he was a legit young high school student and not an older adult trying to get his GED.
trailerparkboys,3bz5od,pinkpools,12,Fri Jul 3 15:17:43 2015 UTC,Yeah a 10 year difference ain't shit. I ran into an childhood friend of my sister recently who had ahem... matured. We had a lovely evening.

trailerparkboys,3bz5od,randylaheyjr,3,Fri Jul 3 13:51:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I had sort of assumed an age hierarchy based on a combination of what was actually stated and the characters' interactions, something along the lines of (in earlier seasons): Ricky/Julian/Bubbles/Randy = early/mid 30s, J Roc/T = late 20s, Cory/Trevor = early 20s, and Jacob being like high school age. (Just with the unfortunate circumstance now that Jacob's actor looks much older than his character is supposed to be.)"
trailerparkboys,3bz5od,Captain_FuckGiraffe,5,Fri Jul 3 19:47:10 2015 UTC,"The boys, J-Roc, T, Corey and Trevor are all the same age because they went to school together. They might be a couple years apart but it's not that big of a gap."
trailerparkboys,3bz5od,dubs2112,3,Fri Jul 3 20:02:20 2015 UTC,"You're probably right, since most of my theory was speculation, but we know there's at least a couple years' difference--when Erica questions/hits on Julian, we learn that he's at least 32, and in (I think?) the same season, we learn that J Roc is 29 when he's arguing with his mother. At another point, Ricky tells Sarah that he and Julian have ""owned Cory and Trevor since they were six,"" which also suggests an age difference there.   Of course, this is all in a show where continuity is a bit unstable and characters contradict each other all the time, so..."
trailerparkboys,3bz5od,Captain_FuckGiraffe,2,Fri Jul 3 21:13:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the boys had to have been born around 1970 according to Halloween '77 footage. Julian being 32 around the first few seasons seems right."
trailerparkboys,3bz5od,pinkpools,2,Fri Jul 3 21:25:57 2015 UTC,I think they're a few years older than that.  You can see Julian with a drink in Halloween '77 so I would think they'd have to be in at least 3rd or 4th grade at that point.

trailerparkboys,3bz5od,A_Bungus_Amungus,5,Fri Jul 3 14:06:11 2015 UTC,I always assumed Jacob was about 15 in Season 1.  That means he's only about 9 years older than Trinity.  A 26 year old guy and 18 year old girl having a baby is not a big deal at all.  What makes it trashy is that neither of them are anywhere near being capable of supporting a child.

trailerparkboys,3b7zsf,carramrod191,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:24:15 2015 UTC,What's funny is Julian buys that bottle and claims Rickey asked him to buy it for the old man. Later Rickey completely forgets Julian did that for him and actually believes he bought the liquor himself.
trailerparkboys,3b7zsf,Grantonius,3,Sat Jun 27 20:42:37 2015 UTC,"I'll confirm later and come back and edit.   But I'm thinking this could be in Season 5 when Ray's trailer burns down, and Lahey offers to let Ray stay with him and Randy.  I think it goes like   Lahey: Why don't you come spend a couple nights with me, bud?  Ray: No, I don't think so buddy  Lahey: Why? Is it because of me and Rand?  Ray: No, it's because I don't like you buddy, I'd rather sleep on the goddamned  ground, kapeek?  EDIT:    Damn, I was close, The line I thought of was ""No, I don't think so, Jimmy"" and then Lahey asks if it's because he doesn't have a wheelchair ramp.

trailerparkboys,3aw83n,MrMustangg,10,Wed Jun 24 08:52:08 2015 UTC,"Some of the actors are pretty cringey, some have improved over the years. Bobandy is a lot less awkward than he used to be, but Trinity's acting didn't really improve (which is a little more excusable when she was younger I guess). Don/Donna was awkward at first but seemed to get better this season (meshed better with the cast).  Particularly bad, though, are the background and bit part actors, people who show up for only one episode or the park residents. Prime example from the past season: the park inspector/appraiser guy. Dunno where they find these people, but they need to do a better job in my honest opinion.  Leslie Dancer is god awful. Not that the lines couldn't have been funny, but his delivery killed any punchline for me. I really, really hope he doesn't reprise that role next season."

trailerparkboys,3aw83n,greggpecker,10,Wed Jun 24 17:42:48 2015 UTC,I sorta feel bad for her because she's cast as such a boring character. Everything just happens to her. I'd like to see her get fed up with Ricky and Lucy's bullshit and have some kind of character development. Maybe we should get to see her making the same mistakes as her parents.   We've never seen her mad (or happy or sad).
trailerparkboys,3aw83n,mshelbo,3,Wed Jun 24 12:16:12 2015 UTC,I think it's because she has no other formal acting experience besides TPB. All of the other lead actors have had parts in other things and have been acting for years. She had her few bit parts as a kid and then they brought her back after a decade for the new seasons. She had no training or acting work in between.

That's how she delivered that line in the scene with the baby in the barn.  How a competent actor would have delivered it would be something more like  ""Oh, dad! You're going to be such a great grandfather, I love you!""  That scene more so than any other in the series, I thought it was blatant that they actually scripted it, which they should stay as far away as possible from."
trailerparkboys,3aw83n,dellett,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:58:46 2015 UTC,Exactly. This is the scene that made me realize how appalling her lines were.

Like when Ricky is trying to retrieve shopping carts when he's a mall cop, he keeps falling over because he's slipping on the ditch.

trailerparkboys,3aprk5,Kartingf1Fan,15,Mon Jun 22 14:44:39 2015 UTC,"There's a pretty long running gag on TPB's that no one ever eats normal food.  Pieces of bread with ranch dressing, Ricky's Pepperoni cocks (though it's a food...is that really ""normal""?).  Bread heels with grease, a plain stalk of celery, Trevor's tragically sad ""piece of bread"" in the dump, Bubbles ""buffet"" in the last season that was barely a buffet (bottles of red liquid, a giant can of what I assume was baby corn).  Every time normal food is introduced, someone or something steals it. (Neapolitan Charlie stealing a sandwich, the cat at the end of season 9 stealing Corey's burger, Philadelphia Collins stealing Bubbles bread and bologna loaf, Steve French stealing Randy's burgers, Ricky steals and ""eats"" nine cans of Ravioli but we never actually see it, though there's one empty can laying by Ricky.  The Dirty Burger is constantly making burgers that look way too burned to be edible (the burgers were stolen, ha!), same while Randy cooks burgers, all burnt to shit  (Barb points out that they're ""the parks burgers"" so yup, Randy stole them and made them his own stash.)    Even Lahey's ""Liquorball"" sandwich breakfast was interrupted by Cyrus and Sam bursting through the door and YUP, Sam takes it from him.  Then there was the time Randy took a bite of a cheeseburger that was actually a Blue Jay. (is that food?)  Other instances of food being stolen are Sam's hot dogs being stolen by Bubble's cats, Ricky stealing Lucy and Sarah's cereal and milk, Sam holding a chicken leg but never actually eating it while singing in the nightclub/restaurant (pretty sure he stole it from someone's table), Bubbles having a chicken leg (stolen from Lahey) during Community Day and instead of eating it, he rubbed it on Lahey's glasses lenses.  Even the lobster meal (pretty sure that was stolen too) from the start of Say Goodbye to the Badguys never actually gets eaten, rather smashed by Ricky's gun.  Ever take a good look at that ""Mexican dish"" Bubbles is holding during the Sunnyvale Retirement commercial?  It's barely food.  Even the ""liquorito"" that Bubbles makes Julian is inedible as it's a miniature liquor bottle in a wrap.    The only time I can remember that food was legitimately purchased and consumed was Bubbles/Conky buying food in the woods while looking for Jacob and the fuckgoofs...though Bubbles makes like 40 bucks a month, so where did he get that food/money from? Stolen?  edit: If you're wondering about Randy's cheeseburgers.  He takes them from Barb's freezer.  They're stolen.  Lahey just tolerates his cheeseburger habit but doesn't own the trailer or the fridge.  Lahey even mentions Barb being the rich one who owns the entire park.  That's why Barb is constantly giving Randy a hard time for the amount of burgers he asks for. ""Three burgers, Randy?....Four, Barb. ....FOUR?""  edit 2: the ""Distraction chicken"" Bubbles bought for Julian would be an example of actual food that wasn't stolen and Barb's snack cakes.  Other than that, can anyone think of any other times the food they were eating wasn't either stolen or barely even qualifying as ""food""?"
trailerparkboys,3aprk5,alsorobots,2,Mon Jun 22 20:01:31 2015 UTC,Uh what about cheeseburgers.
trailerparkboys,3aprk5,MuffDiving,2,Mon Jun 22 21:40:56 2015 UTC,"I mentioned that in my comment.  Randy's cheeseburger obsession was first funded by Smokey, his prostitute persona, then when he moved in with Lahey and Barb, he started cooking and eating the cheeseburgers in Barb's freezer.  They didn't belong to him, thus, he stole them."
trailerparkboys,3aprk5,alsorobots,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:48:46 2015 UTC,Didn't he ask if he could leave his burgers in her freezer when he told Barb he wanted to be supervisor? Then she basically said if he wants to be supervisor then they beyond to the park

trailerparkboys,3ar5p1,comfy_socks,8,Tue Jun 23 02:29:03 2015 UTC,"I lived in a trailer park with my husband when we first got married. There were 4 types of people who lived there: Drunk old bastards who were retired and lived there permanently, broke college kids, greasy criminals who bounced from park to park, and Carnies.   The drunk old bastards and college kids weren't so bad, as long as you kept to yourself and watched out for the old people's golf carts they'd zoom around in.   The greasy criminals would break into your cars, houses, etc. They would steal anything that wasn't chained down.   Carnies were the worst. They were super loud, always drunk and one of them tried to steal my barbeque grill. While I was using it."
trailerparkboys,3ar5p1,BrinxJob,10,Tue Jun 23 08:56:02 2015 UTC,You shouldn't have left the barbecue by the curb. It's not stealing if it's put out for municipal pickup.

She left him to attend highschool and pay for living in a trailer at the same time.   This ended up being cool after we graduated because we had a 3 bedroom trailer in the middle of the woods that only costed $400 a month to live at that we could party at.  Pros: lots of trashy parties, lots of smoke, there was a 60 inch TV in the fucker we watched trailer park boys on.  Cons: Too many sluts coming over and trashing the place, one girl got really drunk and pooped on the floor once, these 2 kids would come over high as fuck and climb on the roof in the middle of the night, this kid in the neighbor trailer named troy who was 8 would threaten to stab us.   Honestly trailer park life isn't that bad, I could see myself living in the trailer when I'm retired. The area mine was in was very beautiful though, and I had a place I could party with my friends at when I was underage so i'm biased."
trailerparkboys,3ar5p1,msphxy,5,Tue Jun 23 22:20:24 2015 UTC,"Most trailer parks in NS are considered scourges of the community, and not without good reason. They are primarily populated by those of low socioeconomic status, and, as such, experience disproportionately high levels of criminal activity. Pride in one's property is virtually non-existent. To top it off, most parks have deplorable living conditions (sewage and rainwater backup, impassable roads, garbage everywhere, etc.) due to incompetent management.  TL;DR - TPB is an accurate portrayal of trailer park life in NS."
trailerparkboys,3ar5p1,btbam666,2,Thu Jun 25 01:52:34 2015 UTC,Lived in a trailer for the first 7 years of my life. Barely remember much but from what I do it was terrible. Walls paper thin. Too many people close together.
trailerparkboys,3ar5p1,faithnolegacy,2,Tue Jun 23 15:05:14 2015 UTC,"The Trailer Park that I lived in was pretty similar to how the introduction to Trailer Park Boys is. There were a lot of kids riding bikes, fishing in the local ponds and playing games.   Then you had some pot smokers and rednecks who lived in the town too. There was this guy named Darwin who had a retard brother, he lived with his mother who was a heroin junkie and basically he hung out with this really old dude in his early 60's named Pete. They would smoke joints and have beers and play loud country music. They were pretty chill though.  I lived in about three trailers.   The first one I rented was in moderate condition, but it stunk like cat piss in one of the rooms (my room) they ripped the carpet out and it still stunk. It had a pretty nice living room and it had a peace tree in the side yard. Somebody bought our trailer so we moved out.  The second one was fucking shitty and creepy. We were offered this trailer while we were rebuilding our third trailer. There was a hole in the living room floor, the AC barely worked, the bathroom floor was caving in, the kitchen was absolutely disgusting, the whole trailer had bugs, and to top it all off it was haunted. Some guy killed himself in the trailer and it was extremely creepy at night because we would hear footsteps and shit at night. There was only one bedroom and everybody slept in the living room for comfort.   Our third one was extremely nice and was well worth the wait of living in the haunted trailer."

trailerparkboys,3and2i,jerod1995,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:59:57 2015 UTC,I think the Kankers can be condensed into the two Asian guys that work for Cyrus. No real other siblings I can think of.   Nazz... I guess either Sarah or Lucy. No other female roles in TPB that make sense for her.

trailerparkboys,3and2i,thesimplemachine,-2,Mon Jun 22 04:32:11 2015 UTC,"No, it really does suck. The backgrounds don't move/ don't exist. It's super low budget, and there is hardly any plot line. It was just some low quality cartoon that they could use to fill time between commercials. Theres no heart, there's no soul, there is no genius. Trailer park boys on the other hand is a well thought out, mockumentry/ social commentary which is generally improvised and has incredible character development with incredible plot lines that take the viewer on a emotional roller coaster.  Sorry you got douped into liking a stupid cartoon when you were little"
trailerparkboys,3and2i,meatasaurus_R3X,4,Mon Jun 22 10:42:53 2015 UTC,"So what you're saying is... a cartoon from the 90's is shittier than a real life show made in the 2000's?  Most cartoon backgrounds dont move, obviously a 90's cartoon will be low budget compared to a newer show and same with story. If you think about it most of what TPB does is very similar to what EEE did."
trailerparkboys,3and2i,603g,3,Mon Jun 22 14:04:47 2015 UTC,"No offense man, but you are just objectively wrong. The show lasted for over 10 years, making it the longest-running show on Cartoon Network as well as one of the longest-running animated shows in general. During that time it was nominated for several awards (and won a few) for its animation, direction, storyboarding and music.   The ""low-budget"" animation style was actually a purposeful throwback to the Golden Age of Animation (1930s-1950s, think Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny, Tom & Jerry, etc.). If you recall, the earliest seasons of TPB were of pretty low quality, appearing to be filmed by an independent camera crew with a handicam and a boom mic, so I don't even see how that's an argument if you're trying to compare the two.   I don't think it's fair to criticize it's lack of a ""plot line."" It has no illusions of aspiring to some cohesive story, and like the old cartoons it draws its influence from, each episode is meant to stand alone as its own story. TPB on the other hand has always had a serial plot, so again, I don't see why you're trying to compare them in that regard.   In all, it is one of Cartoon Network's most successful shows, and it was certainly not something used to fill time between commercials. You can say that you don't like it, but saying that it was a bad show is disagreeing with tens of millions of viewers and the nearly unanimous opinion of critics."

It's supply and command, supply of kitten accommodations was to high so Ricky commanded they switch to honey oil production.

Take Oscar from the office for example, there's constant jabs at his sexual orientation throughout the series."
trailerparkboys,3ajmth,Buzanks,4,Sun Jun 21 02:01:11 2015 UTC,"I feel with The Office the general notation was to show that there was a mix in the feelings of wether someone is gay or not and how the American culture tends to handle these sorts of things. Not trying to put Canada on a pesidtal here however :P. Oscar being gay was not meant to be treated as a token or seen as ""the gay guy"" and certainly Oscar never saw himself as such. I think the writers for that show intentionally made him be chided at and made fun of to represent Americas attitudes to someone who is different and how we tend to ""token"" those who are."
trailerparkboys,3ajmth,Boner4Stoners,3,Sun Jun 21 02:49:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think The Office did a great job with Oscar.   Michael clearly doesn't care that he's gay, it's just Michael really doesn't know how to handle it, so even though he tries to welcome Oscar he comes across as a dick. He just doesn't know any better."

I also noticed that Ricky has a very progressive view of women's rights with Lucy and her tendency to bang other guys (""she's her own woman"") and do her own thing. It's one of his more likeable traits."
trailerparkboys,3ajmth,JaquesNoir,3,Sun Jun 21 21:11:05 2015 UTC,"For being a complete idiot, Ricky is pretty respectful and tolerant I have noticed. If it doesn't concern him, he brushes it off as ""no big deal..."" and proceeds to get drunk and/or high afterwards."

I love that despite all the shit these people have been through together, they still accept everyone from the park as part of their family, no matter how crazy or weird they might be.  However, in episode 4 of season 2 (""A Dope Trailer is no Place for a Kitty"") Sam refers to Jim and Randy as ""You two fairies."" This was however prior to them publicly being open as a couple, as well as an insult from a mafka that ain't from the park originally."

In real life, lahey and randy would be called faggots every day and the black character (J rocs friend) would get called a nigger. That's plain and simple. It was progressive of the show but not true to life. Then again, if the characters said insults like that I wouldn't like them anymore :/"

Randy, Lahey and Tyrone might face crude name calling in some trailer parks around the world but I'm sure there are some parks where they would be respected.

It was basically a nice way of showing your support for life and leisure at Jax Beach and in the Intracoastal/St John's River. The past few years have seen it take off from being a niche local expression to a major competitor for Tommy Bahama and Guy Harvery, which essentially lumps them into the redneck beachcomber demographic.

Due to them feeling like they were disrupting peoples lives inside the trailer parks they rented out. Here is a link to their documentary on how the show got started and pretty much everything up to the 7th season. It is narrated by Mike Clattenburg's(Creator and Director) Wife
trailerparkboys,3a0hys,DanceSamDance,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:17:59 2015 UTC,That was for the earlier seasons... At the old Halifax Rehabilitation Centre ... I'm not sure why they didn't keep that location.
trailerparkboys,3a0hys,krazybones,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:44:02 2015 UTC,They didn't say that in the documentary. They said that it was a hill that wasn't being used so they bought it or what not and purchased some cheap trailers and put it on there.

trailerparkboys,3a31iu,bestsrsfaceever,2,Wed Jun 17 01:16:08 2015 UTC,"I could find dozens of exemple that show discrepancies between seasons, specials and movies, that's just the way they write. If they don't want to carry on with a plot line, they discard it. Move or season. In the movies they refer to the show and specials, and vice versa. And the TPB world is a world that moves quickly, a lot happens between seasons and movies. Where is bubbles school bus?

trailerparkboys,3a31iu,Redemption47,2,Wed Jun 17 10:43:33 2015 UTC,Randy sent him to live with his grandfather so the baby wouldn't grow up around Ricky.

trailerparkboys,3a31iu,Frig__Off,-1,Wed Jun 17 01:17:18 2015 UTC,What happened to Trevor?
trailerparkboys,3a31iu,Valley_Style,3,Thu Jun 18 03:15:41 2015 UTC,"He and Cory left the show after Season 6 and they blamed shitty pay and mistreatment as to why they eventually decided to leave, calling out the producers of the show.  Cory eventually came back of course."
trailerparkboys,3a31iu,Frig__Off,2,Thu Jun 18 03:44:50 2015 UTC,"Well technically he was a producer.   I don't know if there was any drama involved, I just think that he and the other original producers didn't feel like coming back after they ended it with S7 and so the Boys bought the rights and started producing it."

trailerparkboys,3a31iu,fcknwayshegoes,6,Thu Jun 18 00:43:49 2015 UTC,Ray is/was the greasiest bastard in the park. A lot of people miss him in the new seasons and it seems a lot of people are glad he's living in a Florida dump (aka all of Florida). Barrie Dunn definitely brought a great character to the show but I guess it was time for him to retire. Fuckin' way she goes...
trailerparkboys,3a31iu,UltravioIence,1 point,Thu Jun 18 11:10:10 2015 UTC,"I dont get why people like him. he was a prick. hed steal ricks pepperoni without remorse, he stole money from julian, he got mad at bubbles and the boys when he wouldnt use bubbles kart to jump start his car which isnt even possible, got bubbles stranded at the truck stop, burned the boys stripper money on vlt's... I could probably keep going but thats off the top of my head."

I mean, you can keep a half drank bottle of liquor in your backpack or in the trunk or something, but you can't have like an open beer in the cupholder.  That's a state law most places though, as far as I know at least.

trailerparkboys,39q0lm,broff,2,Sun Jun 14 13:49:41 2015 UTC,"Well, an argument for gun ownership goes beyond personal protection. Should you need to exercise armed resistance against a tyrannical government (if you take a look through history...a rather common occurrence), I'd say an unarmed public doesn't stand a fighting chance, wouldn't you?"

trailerparkboys,39q0lm,broff,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:51:52 2015 UTC,"I assume you ar referring to the U.S. military. While it is the most powerful in the world that is due mostly in part of manpower.  Are the men and women of the armed forces going to fight the public they've sworn to protect? Who is asking them to do this? Chances are they are going to defect and turn on the government themselves.  Keep in mind we are talking of true tyranny, not some political ideal that people are divided on. It would have to be something that makes the entire public believe they need to resist the governments new influences."
trailerparkboys,39q0lm,BlindSpider11,0,Mon Jun 15 02:19:33 2015 UTC,"Idk what makes you think the military would defect considering from day one of boot camp they're systematically broken and rebuilt mentally. Anyone smart enough to defect is either not in the military, or a commissioned officer. I don't see a coup happening any time soon, and without one the masses may have the numbers, but even gun aficionados don't own 20mm cannons or warships or fighter jets.   I'm not against guns, but I think we need to be honest about why we like them. They're fun to shoot and an excellent example of man's understanding and manipulation of natural forces. Sure the original point of the right to bear arms was to protect against tyrannical governments in theory, but that's just not realistic anymore.   Of course the revolution was never really about tyranny, it was about the political and social elite not wanting to pay taxes."
trailerparkboys,39q0lm,broff,-2,Mon Jun 15 15:48:56 2015 UTC,"When criminals expect armed resistance, they come armed. When an untrained public attempt to use weapons against more experienced criminals they are often disarmed, shot, or shoot innocent bystanders themselves. If criminals are armed and do not meet armed resistance they almost always leave with what they came for without additional violence.  Of the plausible outcomes to a criminal scenario, safety is statistically improved by not introducing additional weaponry to the situation either individually or culturally.  As every gun violence metric indicates, you don't reduce gun violence by ensuring everyone has a gun. The concept of deterrence simply doesn't work on such a small scale. If you want everyone to have a gun you need to train them as a citizens militia to see the benefits you imagine."
trailerparkboys,39q0lm,MrRGnome,2,Sun Jun 14 16:38:17 2015 UTC,"There's still the argument I outlined to another person in this thread, and that's still the need for a public to be armed should they need to exercise resistance against a tyrannical government. An unarmed public would be the easiest thing to control. And I'm just not comfortable trusting a government as much as a lot of anti-gun people seem to be...I've read way too many history books, haha."
trailerparkboys,39q0lm,Wrath_Of_Aguirre,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:42:24 2015 UTC,"I don't trust government and neither should you. That doesn't mean introducing an armed citizenry and leaving it at that is going to yield a constructive outcome to any of the potential issues owning a gun would pose to solve, including enabling the citizenry to overthrow the government.  Do you believe that were it to come to blows and a violation of the American posse comitatus act, that the citizenry would be qualified or equipped to stand against the military and law enforcement branches of the US government? It would be a very short civil war, for certain. No amount of personal weaponry addresses the issue adequately."
trailerparkboys,39q0lm,MrRGnome,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:20:09 2015 UTC,What do you suggest if not having armed citizens should that event occur?
trailerparkboys,39q0lm,Wrath_Of_Aguirre,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:25:09 2015 UTC,"Honestly? Something that is so far off as to be laughable.  I don't know how much you know about blockchains, but they are cryptocurrency enabled decentralized databases. They enable a computer system to run without the authority of any one individual, or with authorities that are revocable by the larger network of users.  I think that the best solution is a transparent, cryptography enabled blockchain based government national bank, capable of minting its own cryptographic fiat within algorithmic parameters you could call a 'constitution'. The central bank funds the government, enables the ""printing of money"" by elected representatives, and is entirely transparent to the public. It also enables citizens to transparently but anonymously cast votes cryptographicly, and more addressing to your point it enables the whole population of money users to at will revoke control over the central bank under any conditions you could imagine and put in the alluded 'constitution', which becomes the rules that the bank is mathematically governed by.  It's a lot less technically ""far off"" than it is culturally. People would need to be convinced, there's a lot of paranoia about technology out there.  Maybe a little too much to think about in /r/trailerparkboys"
trailerparkboys,39q0lm,MrRGnome,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:37:22 2015 UTC,"You can't hunt with handguns in Canada.  Most of them are Restricted which means they need to either be in your safe or at a range.  Transporting them between either place requires an ATT.  If you take your restricted firearm out of your safe to use it in self defense, the Crown will try and charge you with careless storage.  The burden of proof is on you to show that you were able to open your safe and load your gun in a timely manner, as Ian Thomson of Ontario can attest."

Always been there for JRoc - believed in his crazy rap stardom dream from the begening, always backing him up even when he's acting black which would turn off many guys in his position. JRoc succeeds because T believes in him, in his mind it makes him sorta black and T knows this. TPB is about friendship and family, T is JRocs family and vice versa.

trailerparkboys,3961sk,thedonuggs,2,Tue Jun 9 23:18:43 2015 UTC,Yeah leigh is a male in real life.  In the show Don/Donna switches back and forth between genders. I think because he has some sort of multiple personality thing I think.  Im not totally sure about that I need to rewatch the season. I can't remember if Don/Donna does that because Don doesnt want people to know he and Donna are the same person or if his sister actually did die causing him to develop her personality and fill her role.

trailerparkboys,3961sk,luxybug,7,Tue Jun 9 23:40:54 2015 UTC,Supply and command I guess... I do appreciate the continuation of the show! Things like driving tanks through Sunnyvale and Ricky falling every 5 minutes will hopefully cease... Lahey and Jroc still bring a lot to the table for sure!

Netflix shows no signs of stopping its revolutionizing the TV industry and with that comes popularity and there's definitely a market for an open-world TPB game.  Could even make it a bit sillier and 'grander' like Fallout and have you be born 'the chosen one' (and be anointed in liquor) and then have an interim stage as a bottle kid, and then grow up and thus begins the open-world portion.  Take pages out of the books of GTA, Saints Row, Postal, and you've got a potentially phenomenal game that, if given the same attention on the creative side as South Park: The Stick of Truth, could be another landmark TV game."

trailerparkboys,38powf,britkid49,19,Fri Jun 5 20:02:35 2015 UTC,"After now seeing two full seasons without Mike Clattenburg, I think I can safely say he really grounded the show in a certain off-beat, but strangely authentic charm. I believe he helped maintain the balance between characters with quirks and quirks for characters, and in his absence we see a tilt towards more slap-stick style of comedy rather than situational humor. When you aren't relying on the scene itself to carry the humor you have to turn the characters up to 11."
trailerparkboys,38powf,virtual_flyboy,6,Sat Jun 6 00:14:47 2015 UTC,I saw a picture that showed doug Benson was on the show set... only weed jokes can come of this
trailerparkboys,38powf,thelaffingman1,29,Fri Jun 5 21:43:05 2015 UTC,"I don't think it is a good thing. I think Sebastian wore out his welcome and I think all of these guest stars will do the same quickly.   I know my opinion is not that of the majority around here. This is shark jumping season I fear.   For the record, I did not like season 9. I love the early stuff, find 8 to be passable, 9 barely watchable and have little hope for season 10.   I really hope they prove me wrong but if not, I have the early seasons I habitually re-watch anyway."
trailerparkboys,38powf,alsorobots,7,Fri Jun 5 20:57:37 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that ""shark jumping"" is just a term.  It's not a rule in television.  There is no precise moment a tv show will fail or succeed within the show.  In fact, it's the audience that determines the moments in shows that will excel and moments that will fail.  Each audience is different and the rules are made to be broken.  If you don't mind, allow me to elaborate with a few examples:  Doctor Who premiered in 1963.  The producer and show runner locked horns over how to make the show grow an audience.  The show had an over two-decade run and the budget slashed, the audience dissapeared and the show was cancelled.  Today it's one of the most popular television shows in the world and shows no sign of stopping.  Star Trek was an odd concept: ""Wagon Train in space"" (to those who haven't watched Wagon Train, it was absolutely outstanding).  It was one guy leading a bunch of followers across a vast expanse while encountering daily problems.  The show was only picked up at the insistence of Lucile Ball, who saw the show as revolutionary...but Desilu and NBC had different opinions on the quality of the show.  The show fired it's main producer after the second season, the budget was slashed and the show was soon cancelled.  Currently Star Trek is the most successful television franchise in history spawning movies that have gone on to gross billions of dollars and spinning off not one, but FOUR other Star Trek series.  The Office (UK) was a quirky but dark comedy series that only got two seasons and a special in the UK.  The characters were imported to the US, tweaked slightly and went on to become one of the most successful American sitcoms of all time, running NINE seasons and launching the careers of the main actors.  Trailer Park Boys is experiencing a particularly divisive time where the main actors and producers have to start considering where the characters are at this point, how big the audience is getting with Netflix distribution and whether the show is the original pilot shot in black and white or a completely new show after Season 7.  TPB's already had Randy jump the cheeseburger.  Every season finale is final enough to end the series, and every season opener is vague enough to be the first episode of the series.  Characters change, vanish, appear, etc, between seasons and the movies appear to exist in an alternate dimension where the events the boys experience happen differently from the television series.  As long as there is interest in the show, the show producers will continue to invest in these characters.  Continue to complain and the boys will move on to some new project and we'll be left sitting in this sub wondering why /r/firefly has more subscribers.  edit: I'd like to add Breaking Bad.  AMC had so many doubts over the first series that Vince Gilligan was ready to end the story after one season, luckily, he begged enough that AMC gave the show a second season (which many fans of the show thought was the ""shark jumping"" season with a weird airline crash and a pink teddy bear).  Very slowly the show picked up an audience but didn't truly come of age until it was picked up by Netflix.  The show went on for five seasons and is almost universally considered one of, if not the greatest television show ever made."
trailerparkboys,38powf,SorcerersStoned,2,Sat Jun 6 19:43:29 2015 UTC,"I am a Scooby-Doo fan, and that animated show has been hashed and re-hashed into many different series. There was even an episode in What's New that the animators made fun of themselves in 03 with a ""jumping the shark"" joke, but has since come back with Mystery Inc. which was a very cool and funny modern take on the gang.  Addendum, I love the Firefly reference. I have not seen one episode of that show, and just recently realized it was a thing."
trailerparkboys,38powf,alsorobots,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:32:47 2015 UTC,"You should watch Firefly.  It's excellent.  TV shows were in danger of ""jumping the shark"" maybe a decade ago, even as recent as five years ago, but now, the networks are sucking wind.  The cable channels are digging under the barrel to find premium content (look how lucky AMC got with Breaking Bad, Walking Dead, Madmen...and now....nothing).  Netflix simply changed the game.  They came into the game with the business goal to replace linear television and instead of a slow and steady onslaught, they punched linear tv in the jaw so hard, their shit is still wired shut.  Trailer Park Boys was a big slice of that strategy.  TV just isn't the same as it used to be.  Look at Top Gear, for example!  If what happened this year had happened in 2008, the show would have been dead as a doornail.  Now, networks are scrambling to beat Netflix to the punch before it revives the show.  It's simply too powerful to ignore now.  People want shows without commercials or censorship, period."

Some of the writing in 9 was perfect, double unicorn, the motel, slingshot guy etc. I dunno, I feel like they are hitting their themes of love, family and friends confidently and comically, which is what they've really been about, amidst all the crazy liquor and dope escapades.

Without his creativity in there, its bound to go down hill unless they follow his formula .  If you don't know what I mean... Watch this documentary by Mikes wife,   It started out as a mockumentary... But as soon as a few of the actors started writing, and mike stopped... it went down hill and lost a little something.  How long before they put a laugh track in... Is what I want to know."
trailerparkboys,38powf,bfurlong,2,Fri Jun 5 21:16:31 2015 UTC,The actors have been writing since the very beginning

trailerparkboys,38obi6,TheMagicTorch,6,Fri Jun 5 14:47:01 2015 UTC,"I'm reserving judgement until I've watched the new season, but it does make me nervous."
trailerparkboys,38obi6,mshelbo,3,Fri Jun 5 18:57:04 2015 UTC,"I am sofa king sick of Snoop Dogg. I saw him at Coachella 2012 and he was fucking lame. He's basically a novelty version of his older self and anything he touches just reeks of cheese. Did anyone else cringe when they first heard Gorillaz ""Plastic Beach"" and heard Snoop doing his hype shit at the beginning of the album? He ruined my image of Gorillaz for me, marked the point where the show ""Weeds"" jumped the shark and I'm afraid he's going to lower the TPB bar of funniness. Fakin' Snoop Dog cheese-ball bastard."
trailerparkboys,38obi6,JoveX,7,Sat Jun 6 05:41:09 2015 UTC,"Does anyone else have a problem with this?  I feel like this could go horribly wrong.  Hear me out:  I know that TPB has had celebrity guests in the past.  Closer to the Heart with Alex Lifeson is one of my favourite episodes, Working Man with Rita MacNeil was amazing, and anything with Sebastian Bach was hilarious.  That being said, their roles were relatively short and sweet with no more than a few scenes at a time.  I feel that introducing Snoop Dogg will basically turn him into the sole focus of the show.  If he appears in a few episodes similar to how Sebastian Bach appeared then I can't really see a problem with it.  My main concern is that Snoop Dogg is too big of a celebrity for minor roles, and that the entire season will revolve around ""Snoop Dogg this, Snoop Dogg that"", and they'll just end up calling the new season Snoop Dogg: Sunnyvale Life."
trailerparkboys,38obi6,GoodWorkBobandis,2,Fri Jun 5 15:49:53 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way. If it was just Snoop, it'd probably be alright. I'd only want to see him prominently featured in one episode though and then some smaller appearances if necessary.  But we also have Doug Benson, Jimmy Kimmel (who will no doubt draw attention to himself through his show), Tom Arnold. It feels like there's just too many other people to fit in to a 10 episode season."
trailerparkboys,38obi6,randylaheyjr,8,Fri Jun 5 16:45:46 2015 UTC,"I thought it was just Snoop; didn't even know those other dicks were making appearances!  The Boys need to quit relying on celebrity appearances and instead sit down, chill out, take some time off and write a QUALITY script.  I've said this before and I'll say it again... I REALLY FUCKING MISS CLATTENBURG"
trailerparkboys,38obi6,GoodWorkBobandis,2,Fri Jun 5 18:11:13 2015 UTC,"Aside from Sebastian Bach which celebrities were in season 8 and 9?   But I agree with your point about the script writing, watching the behind the scenes on swearnet you can tell the boys were rushed to write season 9, which is probably why it came out so sloppy."
trailerparkboys,38obi6,randylaheyjr,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:23:19 2015 UTC,"I can't think of any, surprisingly.  What I should have said is that The Boys shouldn't rely on celebrity appearances"

trailerparkboys,38inkg,HaveANiceDay243,4,Thu Jun 4 15:22:04 2015 UTC,"Ya, at first it felt weird and forced, but then he really started to fit in and had a few hilarious moments."
trailerparkboys,38inkg,bjacks12,3,Thu Jun 4 16:31:56 2015 UTC,"So I do not get it, is Don just a crossdresser or does he get a sex change?"
trailerparkboys,38inkg,kteague,10,Thu Jun 4 18:23:49 2015 UTC,Just a crossdresser.  He goes back and forth in S8.
trailerparkboys,38inkg,Heiz3n,3,Thu Jun 4 17:24:25 2015 UTC,"In Season 8.5 on swearnet Don and Randy go to Burger King and Don just gets a salad from their ""plant inspired menu"". Then later Don announces he's going to South America on a spiritual retreat for ""6 to 12 months"", then after that Donna makes an appearance and she chows down big time on greasy Burger King food with Randy. Too funny."
trailerparkboys,38inkg,bjacks12,-2,Thu Jun 4 17:34:35 2015 UTC,Pretty sure Donna is a woman from the context of all the conversations in s9.  On top of the fact that they are in a womens prison....

trailerparkboys,38inkg,grandmoffcory,7,Thu Jun 4 19:32:19 2015 UTC,"i'm pretty sure he's a buddy of theirs, i've seen him in some behind the scenes stuff with the guys. there was an interview on Swearnet, iirc where it's revealed that Leigh MacInnis (Don/Donna) is going to be starting his own show where he takes drugs and reviews them or something like that.   It's called Trippin' With Leigh  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uhs-gnEcqQk https://www.facebook.com/trippinwithleigh"
trailerparkboys,38inkg,Lurktator,3,Thu Jun 4 18:30:30 2015 UTC,So my purpose of this whole Trippin' with Leigh is to go back to the very roots of man/womankind. Before religious beliefs and money mattered there was a universal belief in nature and the evident power that exists within it. I'm doing some of these spiritual medicines and hallucinogens and travelling to the jungle to let go of everything that is destroying the world today and in doing so I hope to discover another part of myself that belongs to nature and the universe as a whole!    It sounds like Leigh is just playing a slightly exaggerated version of himself when he's Don.

Randy then told people on our team I'd been hitting on him which was embarrassing as none of those heathens knew TPB and they believed him.

trailerparkboys,38e9cn,STHTFH,5,Wed Jun 3 19:45:54 2015 UTC,According to this thread (and some actual articles that have been posted here) DB is Doug Benson. So BF & JK are the only 2 still unknown.

trailerparkboys,38e9cn,IAmTheWaller67,5,Wed Jun 3 22:19:19 2015 UTC,I've seen Brendan Fraser and Jimmy Kimmel getting thrown around but I'm not sure how much truth there is behind those.
trailerparkboys,38e9cn,STHTFH,9,Wed Jun 3 21:11:19 2015 UTC,I tried Google to give me a list of celebs with those initials to try and get an idea but you really don't get a lot of answers so it really wasn't too much help. For BF there's not really much that comes up except for Fraser. I wouldn't think it's him but really you never know and I can't think of a better answer for bf. For JK I think Kimmel makes sense (funny enough his name didn't even appear in my search so does show Google isn't going to be much help) but there's also another name I saw that would make a lot of sense too. Johnny Knoxville.
trailerparkboys,38e9cn,YouAreSoLying,3,Wed Jun 3 21:22:52 2015 UTC,Probably Jimmy Kimmel. TPB were on Getting Doug With High promoting Swearnet. They mentioned smoking and possibly working with both Snoop and Kimmel.
trailerparkboys,38e9cn,PaddysMac,3,Wed Jun 3 21:31:31 2015 UTC,Yea figured Kimmel cuz he also was I think the only national talk show/late night show to have them on.

Randy was on stage so my attention was up there. My brother nudged me and motions to look behind me with his head.   Boom, Jim. Fucking. Lahey. 10 feet away from me.   Three other guys who ended up just being loud mouth jackasses by the end of the night go up to him with their phones, out, immediately trying to put their arms around him to get a picture. I stood a bit behind and watched him turn them down as he was heading up to the stage in about 15 seconds, they walked away disheartened and I almost did too, but I had a bit of a Dark and Stormy in me, so I walked up to him, hold out my hand and just said ""I'd just like to tell you I'm a huge fan man.""   He kinda looked up to the stage and back at me, shook my hand and said 'Thank you very much, thank you for coming out.""  then headed through the crowd up to the stage.   The show was fucking fantastic (never seen the boys live, but if their show is like the ones on netflix, Randy and Lahey's show was about 100 times more entertaining) but getting that handshake REALLY made my night."

However he's partly the reason Trevor left the show.  https://libcom.org/library/trailer-park-boys-what-really-happened-cory-trevor  It seems that Barrie Dunn (Ray) was an executive producer and by Michael's account, lied a lot about wages and really didn't want to address Michael's concerns in a serious and respectful way.   Don't take the link as fact, there are two sides to all stories. It's just an interesting perspective on the behind the scenes of TPB."

trailerparkboys,3830pk,Melkor_Morgoth,5,Mon Jun 1 21:28:24 2015 UTC,I'd rather have Trevor back.
trailerparkboys,3830pk,ablebodiedmango,6,Tue Jun 2 01:21:31 2015 UTC,Hmmm. I get that. The Cory-Jacob team doesn't do it for me. But I guess the biggest thing that's missing is the man himself: Clattenburg.
trailerparkboys,3830pk,Melkor_Morgoth,18,Tue Jun 2 01:27:22 2015 UTC,Clattenburg was really the heart of the show. If you watch Swearnet: The Movie or Happy Funtime Hour it's pretty obvious why the the show went downhill now that the boys are writing it.
trailerparkboys,3830pk,the_Ex_Lurker,24,Mon Jun 1 18:25:32 2015 UTC,"Agreed, being more crude and vulgar doesn't make a series better.  we don't need more boner shots."
trailerparkboys,3830pk,KangFu,9,Mon Jun 1 18:56:26 2015 UTC,I disagree with the boner shots. But I agree that it doesn't need to be more vulgar.
trailerparkboys,3830pk,fuck_the_DEA,2,Mon Jun 1 22:32:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, boner shots are pretty fucking funny."
trailerparkboys,3830pk,WookieesGoneWild,8,Tue Jun 2 04:11:05 2015 UTC,"Clattenburg never wrote everything himself, even in the Cartboy days. Thinking the boys had no part in the earlier writing goldness (which I still find in season 8-9) is just not true."
trailerparkboys,3830pk,Gabriel_NDG,11,Mon Jun 1 19:32:07 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with you. But without someone there to keep the writing and directing in check things go downhill, at least in my opinion. Mike was also instrumental in making the look like an actual documentary. Obviously I don't know him in real life but I wouldn't imagine he would've allowed low-budget CGI (for fuck sakes) in a show whose whole premise is to appear somewhat aesthetically believable."
trailerparkboys,3830pk,the_Ex_Lurker,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:14:47 2015 UTC,Wait...not true about the cgi. In the early seasons there were a couple episodes with real real REAL bad cgi fire. But im just nit picking hahaha.
trailerparkboys,3830pk,TheEvilGerman,1 point,Tue Jun 2 06:17:37 2015 UTC,I might have forgotten about that. Which episodes?
trailerparkboys,3830pk,the_Ex_Lurker,4,Tue Jun 2 11:28:06 2015 UTC,"I definitely wouldn't consider season 8 downhill; I laughed at our more than season 6 and 7 combined. 9 was a bit of a letdown for me, but it's definitely all a matter of taste."
trailerparkboys,3830pk,HowieCameUnglued,2,Mon Jun 1 18:56:05 2015 UTC,"I agree. Season 8 got me amped that the series was back on track and then season 9....well, it was season 9."
trailerparkboys,3830pk,magikalmuffins,5,Mon Jun 1 20:59:07 2015 UTC,"I though season 9 was pretty old school, no crazy bullshit."

trailerparkboys,3830pk,GG_Henry,15,Mon Jun 1 17:25:14 2015 UTC,"Maybe not Private Dancer, but liquor smurf is business as usual for Lahey.

trailerparkboys,3830pk,MY_GOOCH_HURTS,5,Mon Jun 1 23:34:35 2015 UTC,It was pretty intense to see Lahey hit an all time low though. Damn near disturbing. 10/10
trailerparkboys,3830pk,spookydoom,3,Mon Jun 1 17:58:09 2015 UTC,I though the Pvt. Dancer stuff was alright. Its better than running drugs with a model trains and sebastian bach being involved. Also no conky bullshit so to me is was about as normal as it gets after being on for 9 seasons.
trailerparkboys,3830pk,gnrp45,6,Mon Jun 1 21:45:15 2015 UTC,Honestly the scene with conky in Sam's vet clinic might be the funniest scene in all of tpb IMO.  I didn't mind pvt dancer to much either but wasn't a big fan of the boys being outside the park so much this most recent season
trailerparkboys,3830pk,GG_Henry,3,Mon Jun 1 22:01:41 2015 UTC,I didnt mind the being out of park that much because they seemed to keep it simple with run down hotel and shit. No town hall or middle of the city stuff.

trailerparkboys,3830pk,Gabriel_NDG,5,Tue Jun 2 00:10:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah i really liked the vet scene too, I just didnt really enjoy the whole conky thing, it went from  normal trailer trash doing redneck shit to kinda of cheesy."

trailerparkboys,3830pk,WarriorHealer,9,Mon Jun 1 18:29:56 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that the show should evolve, but I think losing the recurring mockumentary theme was a mistake. We had seven seasons and a few films that were built around the premise, only to be diminished, in seasons 8/9."
trailerparkboys,3830pk,mobius76,3,Mon Jun 1 18:43:31 2015 UTC,"At least they worked it into the plot, that the Swearnet team bought the rights."
trailerparkboys,3830pk,MY_GOOCH_HURTS,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:36:29 2015 UTC,Season 7 wasn't very mockuymentary.
trailerparkboys,3830pk,Gabriel_NDG,5,Mon Jun 1 19:22:16 2015 UTC,Something died after series 6 IMO. If you watch the final episode of that series it seems like it was meant to end. Everything was so perfect.

Also, they had the owner of the venue keep bringing them liquor drinks over the course of the show. I can't verify what was in Lahey's liquor drink, but I can verify I did have beer in my bottle, so if that is not drinking, I'm not sure what is.

trailerparkboys,37hee9,DJ_Lud,14,Fri May 29 14:48:20 2015 UTC,"Happy to see Jacob getting some love. It's hard to fill Trevor's shoes. Hell, he had to fill in for Trevor AND Corey in Season 7. He wasn't very good in Season 7, but in 8 and 9 he worked really well with Corey."
trailerparkboys,37hee9,thealmightybrush,-8,Thu May 28 01:15:10 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised so many fans find him funny. His acting is hard to watch, not that he has much to work with. Scripts need some support, boys."
trailerparkboys,37hee9,Rickys_HD_SPJs,18,Thu May 28 01:25:19 2015 UTC,"TPB is riddled with bad acting. Trevor wasn't exactly winning awards with his acting.  Edit: I realize my post above said it's hard to fill Trevor's shoes and then I made this post talking shit on his acting. TPB's a weird show, yo. He was both a bad actor and hard to replace :P"
trailerparkboys,37hee9,thealmightybrush,8,Thu May 28 03:27:46 2015 UTC,"This is true, and I thank you for speaking up. Thing is, Trevster came off much more natural than Jacob does with his increased role. Imo, the boys were in much more capable hands with Clatten and Volpe. But beggars shouldn't bitch so bring on S10."
trailerparkboys,37hee9,Rickys_HD_SPJs,2,Thu May 28 03:42:34 2015 UTC,"Jacob is great but I always felt like they just replaced Trevor with another weak willed character that didn't have much personality of his own. All of Jacob's parts on the show are related to his circumstance, like being Phil's son, or being Trinity's husband. But there's never really anything deeper to his character like with Corey and Trevor."
trailerparkboys,37hee9,Bigfrostynugs,2,Thu May 28 01:45:35 2015 UTC,Corey and Trevor were deep?
trailerparkboys,37hee9,alsorobots,2,Thu May 28 04:37:41 2015 UTC,"No, but they were well established characters in their own right, Jacob was clearly just a replaceable cookie cutter character that didn't really add anything new."
trailerparkboys,37hee9,Bigfrostynugs,2,Thu May 28 05:35:05 2015 UTC,"But Jacob was around in episode 1 of the first season.  We even heard Bubbles compare Jacob to Trevor when they wrestled in The Green Bastard episode.  I always got the impression that Jacob was around because the producers noticed Jackson's attitude towards work and pay and realized they might lose him at some point.  Corey, on the other hand, really tried his best to stand out as a character. Did you see Corey dancing?  Did you see Corey enhancing his wardrobe into a distinct character silhouette?  Trevor and Jacob had virtually interchangeable wardrobe.  Trevor (Jackson) needed to stand out more and stop complaining about catering.  I think he realized that and now he's cool with the Boys and I assume he could return at any point.  Who knows?"
trailerparkboys,37hee9,alsorobots,1 point,Thu May 28 06:21:51 2015 UTC,"I totally never noticed that Jacob was around the whole time, I thought he introduced when Phil started to get popular. You're right, I take back what Is said, I guess it's more Corey that was developed, I just associate the two together always. I hope to see Trevor in another season or movie though!"
trailerparkboys,37hee9,Bigfrostynugs,18,Thu May 28 17:19:45 2015 UTC,I don't understand how you idiot cocksuckers can spell his name wrong when it's literally right there on the script.

trailerparkboys,37hee9,nova-chan64,6,Thu May 28 01:24:32 2015 UTC,He expressed that he wasn't be treated well by the rest of the cast. I guess he felt that he was being treated like his character on and off camera.
trailerparkboys,37hee9,Bigfrostynugs,1 point,Thu May 28 01:43:23 2015 UTC,"Sometimes friction between producers as a specific actor doesn't affect how you get along with everyone else, plus I think that other than the money complaints, he realized the sandwich thing was being a bit childish."

trailerparkboys,37hee9,Subflowing,16,Wed May 27 20:38:52 2015 UTC,"So do they register a new production company for every season as a business strategy?  I was looking for sunnyvale productions and i noticed that each season has a new name ""sunnyvale productions"" 8, 9, and now 10. Even on employee linkedin profiles they list sunnyvale productions 8,9 or 10 separately  As Well as the directors guild of canada's production list.   Really curious as to the reason behind it, if they do actually register a new company for each season"
trailerparkboys,37hee9,RashestHippo,18,Thu May 28 02:10:19 2015 UTC,It's to protect themselves from being sued. Financials are put in place on a season by season basis and so if someone wants to file suit they sue that season rather than the boys. It keeps them from losing everything if something unfortunate happens.
trailerparkboys,37hee9,KyleDComic,9,Wed May 27 20:03:48 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much the conclusion i came to when researching, makes total sense business-wise. thanks for the reply"
trailerparkboys,37hee9,RashestHippo,2,Wed May 27 20:12:04 2015 UTC,"No, because they could just choose to be, like, Lahey Productions or something."
trailerparkboys,37hee9,PCsNBaseball,3,Wed May 27 20:29:17 2015 UTC,"My understanding is Showtime produced the early seasons and Netflix is marketing their new ones. Leaving the crew to make their own production company.  Edit: I see what you mean ""Sunnyvale Productions 10 inc."""

But Swearnet is kind of about them not being able to get the rights to TPB to make new seasons. I mentioned Drunk and On Drugs, and about them being completely unrelated."
trailerparkboys,37hb8b,Gabriel_NDG,1 point,Wed May 27 18:22:44 2015 UTC,"yup you did, sorry bud I read too fast. He should indeed watch the ones you mentioned even if not TPB."
trailerparkboys,37hb8b,Gabriel_NDG,2,Wed May 27 18:31:09 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks! I think only a couple of those are on UK netflix though, would I be missing out on a lot if I can't watch all of them?"
trailerparkboys,37hb8b,Gabriel_NDG,1 point,Wed May 27 18:36:40 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. I would skip Trailer Park Boys: The movie if you have to, but the two specials and 2 other movies are gold."
trailerparkboys,37hb8b,DeadHeadAhead,1 point,Wed May 27 18:58:52 2015 UTC,"Seriously, you can't miss the two specials. ""Say good bye to the bad guys"" is one of my favorite TPB moment. Xmas-special is also top notch."
trailerparkboys,37hb8b,Gabriel_NDG,2,Wed May 27 23:57:09 2015 UTC,"Ya, ya definitely need to watch Dear Santa Claus, Go Fuck Yourself. A pristine shitmobile, a white j-roc, how Lahey met Randy, why Bubbles, Julian and Ricky are family, plus so much more. It really explains a lot and ties so many story lines together."
trailerparkboys,37hb8b,we_eeeeeeeeeeeeeeed,1 point,Sat May 30 14:57:39 2015 UTC,"Agreed. ""Tell you one thing, you’ll never catch me driving in a piece of shit like this.""  Lahey actually met Randy before the the xmas special, as a client from man-whore alley."

trailerparkboys,37hb8b,sleepawaycamper,1 point,Fri May 29 20:06:41 2015 UTC,Nah. The show kinda has it's own continuity other than a couple movies.
trailerparkboys,37hb8b,Gabriel_NDG,1 point,Wed May 27 18:52:46 2015 UTC,"It's cool, Brother. I've seen a few episodes of Drunk and On Drugs, and it's pretty intense. I love the Swearnet movie. I've watched it a couple times with different friends. I can't get enough of TPB though, and my friend and I just watched the ""Look everyone, it's fuckin Reveen and Patrick Swayze!"" clip yesterday and were fucking laughing our asses off."
trailerparkboys,37hb8b,carny666,1 point,Wed May 27 21:28:27 2015 UTC,I know the feeling. I think I've watched ALL TPB content at least once a year for 10 years now. IT'S A DESEASE

trailerparkboys,37jkic,Feraligatre,9,Thu May 28 02:23:24 2015 UTC,"I wont downvote this, but for goodness sakes they intended for it to have swearing.  Shouldnt it be at it's funniest when you're witnissing it's true form?  Shame on you, sir or madam."
trailerparkboys,37jkic,orange_tictacs,2,Thu May 28 02:31:39 2015 UTC,But in actuality I hope someone helps you in your sick quest.  Even though I dont agree with you the show is amazing and Ill soon get over that you watch a censored version
trailerparkboys,37jkic,orange_tictacs,2,Thu May 28 02:32:47 2015 UTC,I understand what he's saying though. The bleep can make swearing more effective sometimes.
trailerparkboys,37jkic,PianoTrumpetMax,2,Thu May 28 02:40:42 2015 UTC,It would seem that way but for some reason I just find it more funny hearing the censor. It just seems more real for tv I guess.
trailerparkboys,37jkic,bjacks12,1 point,Thu May 28 05:21:14 2015 UTC,There's just something about the bleep that just drives it home for some reason.  Look up unnecessary censorship on Youtube.

trailerparkboys,37hwd7,GoChiefs,2,Wed May 27 19:42:22 2015 UTC,"Sometimes the Netflix subtitles do attribute lines to ""Tyler"" when he speaks in the regular seasons, though, so I can see where someone would get confused.

trailerparkboys,37atzm,srbumblebeeman,12,Tue May 26 14:49:22 2015 UTC,"The recurring use of ""Bud"" is something small that I've always enjoyed about the series. Julian and Ray use it most of the time."
trailerparkboys,37atzm,randylaheyjr,12,Tue May 26 15:48:32 2015 UTC,Hope the boys can patch things up with the actor that plays ray and bring him back a season.

trailerparkboys,37atzm,eastnorthshore,4,Tue May 26 16:47:21 2015 UTC,Apparently he was a huge dick
trailerparkboys,37atzm,ExplainsSocialEnigma,4,Tue May 26 17:00:01 2015 UTC,"That said, lots of people involved in the production have been accused of being huge dicks. Mike Clattenburg is possibly the only person in a leadership role who comes off well."
trailerparkboys,37atzm,Gunde,1 point,Tue May 26 17:53:29 2015 UTC,Accused by who? (Except for that one guy who went to great lengths to burn every bridge by selling scripts and posting rants about how he hated the direction of the show and everyone in charge.)
trailerparkboys,37atzm,Tsar_Moose,2,Tue May 26 20:29:37 2015 UTC,Michael Jackson left the show because of their alleged dickishness.
trailerparkboys,37atzm,Gunde,1 point,Wed May 27 05:51:22 2015 UTC,"That's my point. Everybody appears to have a negative opinion on the producers based on MJ's tirades. Have anyone else confirmed the alleged dickishness, or could it be that MJ was simply a very difficult person to work with?"
trailerparkboys,37atzm,GoodOneRandy,1 point,Wed May 27 06:24:09 2015 UTC,"To me it seems the boys sided with Corey/Trevor on this issue, by removing a bunch of people on the production side (as well as Dunne) from the show and bringing Corey back."

trailerparkboys,37atzm,mack2nite,3,Tue May 26 18:25:10 2015 UTC,Ray was a good character. He has a small part at the end of my favorite scene. Best part starts at 3:15.   FYI: don't watch if you haven't seen the Christmas prequel yet.
trailerparkboys,37atzm,kcash,2,Tue May 26 22:05:19 2015 UTC,LOL my buddies and I always quote this scene to each other. Ray was by far my favorite character I miss that cocksucker.

Trailer Park Boys (B&W movie) Seasons 1-4 Dear Santa Claus, Go Fuck Yourself (Christmas special) Seasons 5-6 Trailer Park Boys: The Movie (aka The Big Dirty) Season 7 Hearts of Dartmouth - Life of a Trailer Park Girl (Documentary thingy) Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys Countdown to Liquor Day Don't Legalize It Season 8-9"
trailerparkboys,36vx1i,numerica,9,Fri May 22 17:16:41 2015 UTC,This is how I watched the series and it has a pretty decent continuity from episodes to movies. DEEcent.
trailerparkboys,36vx1i,Ronemoo,3,Fri May 22 17:41:06 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this. I always wondered, and it's nice to have a cohesive list. Sorry for the fancy book words."
trailerparkboys,36vx1i,PM_ME_KITTENS_PLEASE,2,Fri May 22 21:13:48 2015 UTC,A what list?  What are you doing using your big school words?  Just use normal people words and I'll understand what you're talking about.
trailerparkboys,36vx1i,numerica,2,Fri May 22 21:17:59 2015 UTC,thanks for this
trailerparkboys,36vx1i,Fetus_Soup,2,Mon May 25 20:15:31 2015 UTC,"They all seem to be in Netflix except for the original film and the ""Hearts of Dartmouth"" or whatever. Any idea where I can see these?"
trailerparkboys,36vx1i,SteppingSplash,2,Tue May 26 16:18:40 2015 UTC,"Hearts of Dartmouth   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIVXAaLBJkI  And if you can stand the commercials, crappy quality, and it being all split up...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-FwdveoKI"
trailerparkboys,36vx1i,numerica,1 point,Tue May 26 16:29:45 2015 UTC,"What about Countdown to Liquor Day? I don't see that one on Netflix either, unless I'm missing something."
trailerparkboys,36vx1i,NormalNormalNormal,2,Thu Jul 9 16:31:38 2015 UTC,"Huh, I guess you're right. If you really need to get your fix, it seems you can rent it for a couple bucks on Google Play."
trailerparkboys,36vx1i,SteppingSplash,16,Thu Jul 9 16:44:27 2015 UTC,"Since, continuity-wise, the movies are a bit fucky since they're mostly non-canon, it really doesn't matter which order you watch them in since they will not affect the series and vice-versa. Now, if you're like me and really really like to try to make them fit, this is the order in which I would personally lump them.   Dear Santa Claus, Go Fuck Yourself (Christmas special) Trailer Park Boys: The Movie (aka The Big Dirty) Trailer Park Boys (B&W movie) Seasons 1-7 Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys Countdown to Liquor Day Don't Legalize It Seasons 8-9   Don't Legalize It and The Big Dirty are the ones that really don't fit since they contain a lot of events that are ignored elsewhere in the series. All in all, it's up to you! Do it how you like; get drunk, get stoned, muck around with Cory and Trevor!"
trailerparkboys,36vx1i,thorsdisciple,9,Fri May 22 15:47:47 2015 UTC,I think watching the Christmas special when it aired (after season 4) is better because it's loaded with jokes that someone watching for the first time might miss.

trailerparkboys,36vx1i,Gabriel_NDG,1 point,Wed May 27 18:34:35 2015 UTC,"i randomly watched starting from season 3 and then went back, watched 1-2, then the rest, didn't watch the movies til years after. I'd say it doesn't really matter, but I'd reccomend watching the season in order. thorsdisciple posted a good list, but, actually i'd watch the big dirty some point between seasons 1 and 7 though, its no big deal but i think you'd like it more when you know the characters better"

trailerparkboys,36w6ze,sonofthedawn_,0,Fri May 22 18:29:19 2015 UTC,Woulda been cool if he had some lines at least. Maybe talking about liquor and whores at least or something
trailerparkboys,36w6ze,kgs1977,2,Fri May 22 18:41:56 2015 UTC,"We were right excited to see the new season when he said he had a cameo, would be really cool if they featured Cud Eastbound in the next season"

trailerparkboys,36rfxb,lps2,152,Thu May 21 17:11:49 2015 UTC,It's a good thing I watch TPB for the complex and intricate plotlines
trailerparkboys,36rfxb,kanno,62,Thu May 21 15:53:57 2015 UTC,"In all seriousness, there are many plot lines that are woven throughout multiple seasons and actually do have a certain level of intricacy. Makes my brain departments get all fucky sometimes"
trailerparkboys,36rfxb,MrJohnnyQuest,21,Thu May 21 17:01:11 2015 UTC,"right.. I'm not trying to put TPB down, just saying that it's not exactly The Godfather or something.  That's part of what I like about it."
trailerparkboys,36rfxb,kanno,29,Thu May 21 17:22:33 2015 UTC,"The thing I like is that while it appears to be simple, there is more going on under the surface.  Like Layhe the first time he sobers up.  At one point, he's pretending he's still sober but secretly drinking.  During this time, he decides he's going to pretend to be drunk so the boys think they can get away with stuff and he can gather evidence.  In other words, for the span of several episodes, he's drunk, pretending to be sober, pretending to be drunk."
trailerparkboys,36rfxb,PigSlam,42,Thu May 21 18:00:35 2015 UTC,Jim Lahey is a fucking drunk and he always will be.

trailerparkboys,36rfxb,knightmarejk,3,Thu May 21 20:49:06 2015 UTC,"Retroactive continuity is common in the tpd timeline. Plenty of plotholes have been ""fixed"" after they aired. For instance: Conky has two ""origin"" stories. Ricky not understanding creditcards, but did in earlier seasons. Barb Lahey was a marriage celebrant in season 1. How the roof disappeared on laheys car. Treena. The premium sunnyvale park (from ctld). The fate of ray (is he dead or in florida?)  Plus shitloads of others."
trailerparkboys,36rfxb,Villainsoft,2,Fri May 22 05:40:15 2015 UTC,"What were the two origin stories for Conky? I thought he was introduced the same way (it was his grandpa's ventriloquist doll or something that used to stand up to bullies) both times we saw him.   And yeah, Ricky getting so much dumber, especially in the new seasons, it kind of annoying to watch."
trailerparkboys,36rfxb,the_Ex_Lurker,2,Fri May 22 12:35:17 2015 UTC,"In the first conky episode, conky was introduced as a puppet bubbles had made. Later it was retcon'd into a puppet his grandfather had given him."

No, they're not. Grams are the basic metric unit of measurement for mass. The basic metric unit of measurement for weight is actually a Newton. Grams are commonly used as an indicator of weight because it's always going to be about the same on earth, but technically 28 grams of marijuana will be 28 grams of marijuana regardless of gravity, while an ounce of marijuana on earth would not be an ounce of marijuana on the moon.

trailerparkboys,36nzes,SmokinDrewbies,-1,Thu May 21 01:42:20 2015 UTC,You just made it sound as if you didn't know what the fuck you were talking about by asking if they were measuring in grams OR ounces when ~28 grams = 1 ounce and then go on to state that 28 grams would be 28 grams on the moon which it definitely is not 28 grams on Earth = ~0.28 Newtons and ~0.28 Newtons on the Moon would be around 4.6 grams.  Take a second to get yourself together bud  I'm Steve Rogers
trailerparkboys,36nzes,wobaekat,2,Thu May 21 02:17:18 2015 UTC,"You've got it backwards. Grams are a measurement of mass, newtons are a measurement of force, also commonly called weight. The way to express the value of a Newton in terms of basic units is 1 kg * m/s2, which can be found using F=m * a, (force=mass * acceleration). Since mass remains unchanged regardless of the gravity, the only variable in the equation is acceleration, which is significantly lower on the moon.  Tl;dr: 28 grams on earth is 28 grams anywhere, it's the weight that changes."

trailerparkboys,36ccnx,ouah,2,Tue May 19 07:20:02 2015 UTC,The only other way I'd think would be purchasing the DVDs. I know season 8 is out and the 9th is releasing soon on DVD here in Canada. If they don't sell the DVDs over in KangarooLand try looking for a region free DVD player as a possible option.

trailerparkboys,36b97w,Vaerulen,5,Sun May 17 23:43:49 2015 UTC,I think they do. If they didn't turn why would they continue making them?
trailerparkboys,36b97w,flaya6,3,Mon May 18 03:27:03 2015 UTC,The absurdly huge piles of cash the show makes would probably be a main reason.
trailerparkboys,36b97w,enough_space,3,Mon May 18 07:01:32 2015 UTC,they answered this in a IMA they did on swearnet. Also if you read Micheal Jackson's blog you my be surprised to know that there really wasn't much money to be made by the show and what there was was taken by the producers at the time. Which might explain why the boys went on the global tour (then then to get free weed )
trailerparkboys,36b97w,ersu99,3,Mon May 18 08:02:33 2015 UTC,"The events accounted by MJ happened during the earlier seasons, well over a decade ago. There's been a dramatic change in production since then and the show itself is way, way more popular now than it was back then. The boys founded an entire entertainment network just so they could buy the rights to TPB and continue making new episodes. It would be highly unwise for them to stop producing their main cash cow just because they don't ""enjoy it."""
trailerparkboys,36b97w,enough_space,0,Mon May 18 08:16:36 2015 UTC,"The events accounted by MJ happened during the earlier seasons, well over a decade ago.    it happened in 2006, but between then and now, there has only been a few years of filming TPB. There were huge breaks in production. So in the life of TPB that was like 3 years ago.   There's been a dramatic change in production since then and the show itself is way, way more popular now than it was back then.    Yeah Mike Clattenburg left by Season 7, and they stopped producing for networks (showcase). Which means the ROI was too low for the network to pick them up another season. So not enough cash to keep producing. Hence why the boys did their own thing, from being in other shows to the big tour and swearnet. Going from starring in your own show to doing bit parts doesn't bode well for someone who made lots of cash.   The boys founded an entire entertainment network just so they could buy the rights to TPB and continue making new episodes. It would be highly unwise for them to stop producing their main cash cow just because they don't ""enjoy it.""   Being part owners, they don't actually need to act any more. They can quite easily get no namers to stand in as replacements. As long as they helped write and produce it, I'm sure the show would still be as good."
trailerparkboys,36b97w,ersu99,6,Mon May 18 09:18:41 2015 UTC,"Production has nothing to do with the popularity of a show. In fact, one could argue that there is an inverse relationship there. I (and likely many others) discovered the show after season 7 when it was put on Netflix. The resurgence of popularity on Netflix was likely the entire reason the show was able to come out of cancellation in the first place.   And what do you mean they don't have to act anymore? They're the three main characters in the only Swearnet series that matters. The idea that any of them are replacable in that show is insane, frankly."
trailerparkboys,36b97w,enough_space,3,Mon May 18 17:16:11 2015 UTC,"you are joking, look how many shows networks axe after just one season because the return on investment wasn't high enough, hence why the networks love reality shows. Netflix is run by geeks who look at other factors like how likely you are to rewatch a show, and how well it will do way after it is released. I highly recommend getting the dvd's and watching with the commentary tracks.  MJ's rant; https://libcom.org/library/trailer-park-boys-what-really-happened-cory-trevor  From tremblay himself; http://www.reddit.com/r/trailerparkboys/comments/26eani/response_to_michael_jackson_trevor/   The three of us took tremendous risks, left good paying jobs and decided to take a chance at doing something we strongly believed in, for next to no money at all.  We, 'the boys' always wondered how the other cast members got away without having to do so much promotional work and believe me it was hard work, long hours, lot's of travel and no pay, it's still that way today.  If this show had this success in the US, we would all be living such different lives.   If you listen to the commentary track they talk about how they got kicked out each trailer park each year for being too noisy, and also how the trailer parks let them film there is wasn't a studio set. So TPB would have been a bit more expensive then a reality tv show, so you can tell their budget was low, especially considering that the network didn't even bother to promote them till season 3.   You can replace any character in a show as long as you do it right. It's called character development, look at ER, Greys Anatomy, Walking dead, MASH, bewitched, batman movies. If ""the boys"" keep writing it I reckon they could do it. Also give credit, Mr Lahey, Randy, J-Roc, and the rest are pretty cool. Mustard Tiger (Phil Collins -RIP) was also a great character."

trailerparkboys,36b97w,grandmoffcory,2,Mon May 18 19:15:30 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. The boys own the boys now, after it came to it's original conclusion on TV they decided to make a stage show and tour, kept making movies, and eventually bought the rights to make the show themselves. On tour they go out to bars and hang out with fans in character."

I don't understand, that's like complaining about a candy bar that doesn't have a wrapper. The boys were back, I thought the story line was great and the writing was top notch. Would you rather just not have any of it? I don't care if one character was annoying, or Ricky fell over too many times, or they didn't talk to the camera enough. Who the hell cares? I love the TPBs! Bring on season 10, bring on 11,12, 13...all I want is more! Stories have to evolve or they end up being......re-runs? What would your reaction be if the guys said ""alright, well you didn't like that season, well were done, goodbye. No more Trailer Park Boys.""?? It's like they do one thing you don't like and you turn against them, it makes no sense to me. Beatles fans weren't content with what was left to them, they were always wanting more and never received it! Same with Monty Python, same with Star Trek.

TPB is actually pretty unique, I think the casting plays a major role in that. Don't be afraid to re watch it though, you probably missed a few things. There are a few movies you're gonna want to check out too.   They just started shooting season 10."

WHY THE FUCK DID HE LEAVE?? If the show is following the path of ""Don't Legalize It"" Ray is technically in Florida participating in an insurance scam; although Ricky somewhat acts like Ray is dead in Season 8."
trailerparkboys,35kyc8,wuzizname,36,Mon May 11 14:06:59 2015 UTC,"Ray was a golden character, but rumour has it the actor is a bit of a prick to work with and was in tight with the original creators of the show. Methinks there may have been a falling out when the boys took over creative control."

trailerparkboys,35kyc8,SpYf3R,4,Mon May 11 22:20:09 2015 UTC,Why did Clattenburg opt out?
trailerparkboys,35kyc8,OneBodyBlade,3,Mon May 11 15:35:36 2015 UTC,The boys bought the rights to the show off him so they could produce it themselves.
trailerparkboys,35kyc8,cashan0va_007,10,Mon May 11 19:17:27 2015 UTC,"In my opinion I haven't liked the show without clattenburgs direction. He used the mockumentary style, the boys film like a big movie with less in depth character interviews"
trailerparkboys,35kyc8,LumberCockSucker,5,Mon May 11 22:18:11 2015 UTC,"Also instead of the episodes being more or less stand alone they all flow together now, which adds more to the movie style. I still like the show but it will never be the same."
trailerparkboys,35kyc8,Zykium,6,Tue May 12 01:25:37 2015 UTC,I think that's a result of their new distribution style. Previously the stories would have more contained stories while an overarching season long plot would be advanced. This keeps the viewer entertained for the week and gives them a reason to come back watch the next episode.  Now they know when a season is released the viewer has instant access to every episode instantly so they tend to focus more on a long term plot and some subplots have take a few episodes to reach resolution.
trailerparkboys,35kyc8,cashan0va_007,1 point,Tue May 12 02:12:37 2015 UTC,"I'm glad that there are other people out there who echo my sentiments -- for a while I thought I was the only one who noticed these drastic differences. I think I counted one show had only one mockumentary interview, and in the beginning there would be 2-3 just covering the thoughts on a trivial matter! That's the genius of Mike Clattenburg.. Also, with everything being shot digital it's not hard to keep all the data or worry about wasting film, so what does it come down to at that point? The editing is too expensive or costly?"

trailerparkboys,35kyc8,PigSlam,4,Mon May 11 22:20:37 2015 UTC,"The actor, Barrie Dunn, was also a producer that's no longer with the show, so I'd imagine that has something to do with it."

trailerparkboys,35on7h,fallway,2,Wed May 13 21:19:19 2015 UTC,Catch a live show if you can when they're on tour.  They're phenomenal.
trailerparkboys,35on7h,DeadHeadAhead,2,Tue May 12 15:01:51 2015 UTC,"Definitely watch it all in order if you can. After season 7, watch Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys, then Countdown to Liquor Day, then Don't Legalize It, prior to seasons 8 and 9. The first movie, The Big Dirty, is probably my favourite of the three but does not continue the story so you can watch that at any point. The Christmas special is a prequel, but I believe it came out around season 4 or 5."
trailerparkboys,35on7h,Hereticdark,2,Tue May 12 21:20:25 2015 UTC,"Awesome! I was wondering in which order all of them were released. I messed up and watched a bit of the first episode of Season 9. Had no idea what was going on (got to bubbles explaining that some thing on a license plate wasn't dead, but was dead).  Going to watch in this order. Thank you!"
trailerparkboys,35on7h,whenwarcraftwascool,2,Wed May 13 05:17:43 2015 UTC,"Ya, the first movie that you should watch if ""Dear Santa, Go Fuck Yourself"". You can even stop watching the series (good luck with that) at it will fill in a lot of blanks. I don't want to give spoilers, but it has a white Jamie, a pristine shitmobile, and even explains a lot about how Bubbles and the became family.  Otherwise...prepare to experience some of the funniest shit and catch phrases that you'll remember and use for the rest of your greasy, fucked-up life."
trailerparkboys,35on7h,Hereticdark,2,Thu May 14 14:24:46 2015 UTC,Countdown to Liquor Day isn't on there I don't think. It's fantastic. It goes between s7 and s8 I think.

The shooting at the beginning was so god damn funny, because we didnt know what to expect at all. Love that show."

trailerparkboys,35ocku,isnugglekitties,6,Tue May 12 04:33:20 2015 UTC,"Imo yes. It's just my opinion, but I think since mike smith started getting my a bigger role, more and more of his smarminess is making it into bubbles.  Also since clattenburg left, the style of writing has been severely dumbed down. For some people who just want a raunchy slapstick show, that might Actually be a good thing. But I personally just miss all the subtlety the early seasons had going. Bubbles was much more reserved, Ricky wasn't always yelling and actually seemed like an undereducated man instead of a intellectually disabled person, and Julian was much more of a schemer.   They jumped the liquor shark wth Lahey at the end of season 9, can't go back from a moment like that.   Edit: none of this means I still didn't laugh and get stoned and watch the new seasons. I just don't like them as much as the old"

When discussing the events of Halloween 1977, each of the boys blames the idea of pushing the police car on someone other than themself, but as we can see from the film, it is clearly Ricky and Julian who do the actual act, since Bubbles was dressed as C-3P0, and C-3P0 is standing by watching while this is going on. This episode also proves that Lahey was in fact truly sober unlike last season. He drops the drunk act when he was floating in the pool after Randy tell him of Bill's eviction and when he confronts the boys about the events of Halloween 1977.

trailerparkboys,35d03v,TheGunslinger5,2,Sat May 9 05:17:13 2015 UTC,"Strangely enough, i do have a sort of sentimental connection with the show.  Most people love it for the ""stupid"" humor, but i enjoy the camaraderie and the family type bond that the characters maintain despite their complete and total dysfunction.  It really helps me stay positive in my own life and aids me in my own struggle against depression.  Happy watching and I hope you get through whatever mess it is that youre in."

trailerparkboys,35d03v,saucypanther,1 point,Sat May 9 19:15:55 2015 UTC,Exactly...all of them have their own unique 'flavour'   My favourite season is probably S5. It's just a shit show...and I think it's Lahey's best season.   I do love the humour of S7 though...come on...who honestly doesn't love the meat stealing operation?

trailerparkboys,35bsdw,rickyjoebobby,2,Fri May 8 21:59:07 2015 UTC,"The one thing that I can think of is that when it comes to trademarks/trade names, etc., you HAVE to go after people or else it can be argued (in court) that your creations are the property of the public domain. If they don't, the next thing you know every joe schmo is selling Bubbles t-shirts online.  Add to that a lawyer that wants to keep a steady paycheck by showing he's actively doing what he's paid to do (protecting yo' shit).  Kind of like those anti-virus programs that continually find tons of ""threats"" that turn out to be false-positives just so they look like they are doing something and justifying their yearly fee.   Though, if the boys actually saw it I'm sure they'd personally think it was fucking cool.  But business is business and lawyers have to do their thing. I would not take it personally or as a rejection.  Or as a sign there's every going to be an official one.   EDIT: Clarification."

Most of Ricky's speech errors are idiomatic in nature resulting in a phrase (or word) that are linguistically incorrect, but phonetically similar. These slips of the tongue are often the result of Ricky’s lack of education, and extensive use of drugs and alcohol, and situations where he may not be thinking clearly. Ricky’s speech errors are possibly some of the most entertaining aspects of his character, and arguably of the entire show. Compiled below are several tables listing the different kinds of speech errors found throughout the Trailer Park Boys movies and television series.

He had some of the funniest scenes in the series.  3rd. The mustard tiger fight  2nd. Taking down two shiny shit badges  1st. Sam Losco wants his $75  (this is my favorite scene in the entire show, Sam Losco flipping out and holding Phil hostage, Phil calling him out about caveman stuff, Losco making Phil tell Ricky to go fuck himself after he shoots him, and then finally Sam proposing his love to barb and bringing up that hes banged some dudes, and lahey returning to the liquor)  Edit: GREEN EGGS AND HAAAAAAAAAAAAAM!"

But Season 1 especially, I watched it over the course of a couple days a few months ago and was really struck with the amount of commentary that is behind the scenes.  For example, in the first scene of the season (after the black and white intro) we see Julian, talking about how excited he is to be getting out of prison, and saying ""Things are going to be totally different"". At the end of the season, when he's back in jail, he's excited to be back in jail. He says ""We'll be ok."", just to perpetuate the cycle of jail and release.

I like that the show just includes those things without being preachy or having it be a big deal. Really, the way Randy and Lahey are treated in Sunnyvale is how we should all view bisexuality or homosexuality, it's just an attribute and it doesn't mean anything. Lahey's still a drunk and Randy still drives 15 cheeseburgers into his gut, that's what defines their characters, not their sexuality."

trailerparkboys,34ziv9,link5057,18,Wed May 6 12:57:00 2015 UTC,Modern Family is the worst when it comes to gay stereotypes.  I can't believe that so many homosexuals think that show has a healthy viewpoint on gay culture. It's always winning gay awards and getting praise from the gay community.
trailerparkboys,34ziv9,link5057,2,Wed May 6 06:02:18 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen the show, could you explain some of the stereotypes or link a youtube video or something? I'm really interested in why it's in your words the worst."

trailerparkboys,34ziv9,link5057,3,Wed May 6 13:24:29 2015 UTC,"If a racist redneck from the backwoods of Texas was forced to write a show portraying gay people, the homosexuals would act like the gays in Modern Family. Super flamboyant and incapable of functioning as a normal human being because their sexual orientation consumes their entire identity. 99% of what the gay characters say has to do with being homosexual. And every time a new gay character is introduced, he behaves exactly the same as the token gay character from the show, Cameron."

trailerparkboys,35165s,mxlplxm,18,Wed May 6 16:44:59 2015 UTC,"Return to the true Mockumentry style that Mike Clattenburg had in place in season 1-7. Rob Wells needs to to calm Ricky the fuck down a bit! Season 9 his WAY to over the top about every little thing and it gets annoying real quick. Scale back Trinity's screen time a lot! Last season she probably had more scenes and lines than she did in seasons 1-7 added up! These past 2 seasons it seems like Bubbles gets emotional over the tinyest of things. Like every other episode it seems like his ready to break down and cry or some shit. This is probably the least likely to happen and would make absolutely no sense on every other TV show out there, but ditch the fancy HD cameras and go back to making the show look like it was recorded as part of some crappy ass homemade movie. In my opinion that's what made the show seem so real and made you believe for a second that everything in the show was going on in real life."
trailerparkboys,35165s,Phoenix_95SP,3,Wed May 6 08:14:20 2015 UTC,"I agree with 3 completely, I got love for Trinity and all, but she got wayyy too much screen time last season.   1, I worry about. I totally get what you're saying, Clattenburg's seasons had a much grittier feel, and his use of cameras was excellent (mockumentary style). But I'd hate to see them try and back track to that now, it would be painfully obvious.   4, I'm on the fence about because I love old Bubbles, but the character had to evolve somehow and wouldn't want to see a hard shift back to old Bubbles this late. He's gotten whiny though, I think letting someone else be the 'voice of reason' could avoid this. But old Bubbles woulda cranked ya one before he started crying, and I miss that.  5, I'm not so sure about. People would probably just think it was due to a lack of funding. The crisp clearness of the HD does make the show seem a bit cartoonish in my opinion. I think they should use some filters and try to give it a less polished look.  2, you can take that up with Ricky. But you'll probably just get couple middle fingers and great big ""FUCK OFF"". I think he just needs to be utilized better so it's not so annoying. He's become a crutch, and it shows.  I think they should do a hardcore season next, as a joke. Maybe shoot most of it in the style that The Shield was shot, and do cut-away's like the old mockumentary style had where you could tell the guy holding the camera was scared or being influenced by the environment. I'd like to see a fast paced story kinda like how Countdown to Liquor Day was set. You don't miss anything anymore because the pace is so slow, and there's nothing going on in the background.   Maybe even have part of the season outside the trailer park. Where could the boys grow massive amounts of high quality weed legitimately? I know two states not too far from Halifax. I'm not sure how it would work, but I think there's a lot of comedic material to be had if they spent some time in Colorado (Washington is fucked, I live there). If they faked a legitimate grow operation with plans to take it back to Canada to be sold tax free. They could get some greasy American to front for the license. And what if....what if the Sunny Vale Trailer Parks doppelganger was in the US? It could be hilarious for at least an episode.    Whatever they do, I hope it's not just another riff on the park."

trailerparkboys,34q433,mshdptato,5,Tue May 5 19:05:16 2015 UTC,"I'm just going to say this since I haven't seen any comments mentioning it.   She was played by Ellen page (Juno, Inception). She basically went on to other things. If you read about the first season nobody thought it would go anywhere and they were shocked it got renewed for a second season. Also she was 12/13 at the time of the first season, for all we know her parents wouldn't have wanted her acting on the show when it started getting big.   It would be cool if she came back and made a cameo though."
trailerparkboys,34q433,SlowpokesBro,7,Sun May 3 23:46:33 2015 UTC,Pretty sure she went to live with her real mom. Idk. Would be a real treat if she came back for a guest episode someday.

trailerparkboys,34ngha,DeathRiderDoom,7,Sat May 2 22:43:13 2015 UTC,"yeah and her and her baby and stuff is just a lame subplot that's taking too much time up in the recent season. Her acting is pretty bad. While i think the idea of having some strict hardass running the park who gives Rick a bit of a run for his money, I'd rather Dancer only be around for 1-2 episodes before getting told to knock knock, fuck off. Donna as a character has run her course - was kinda funny for a couple episodes, but there's no staying power there and it's getting silly. This season needs more Rock Pyle. Kna'mean?"
trailerparkboys,34ngha,SpookyLlama,4,Sat May 2 23:06:25 2015 UTC,What's wrong with lahey running the park? He was always the hardass.  Think they need to bring him back to the point where he can still function whilst being drunk as fuck.
trailerparkboys,34ngha,fourthwallcrisis,1 point,Sat May 2 23:35:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah exactly, it's fun when Lahey's running the park, but i suppose they've always had to shake things up here and there to keep it interesting.

But that's kinda more of a common sense thing rather than counting cards."

Here's what Wikipedia has to say:  The movie and TV series have a few subtle inconsistencies, possibly so viewers who have no previous experience with the show can follow the plot. Several direct contradictions are as follows   Bubbles' shed: In the TV series, Bubbles lives in a number of store-bought sheds. In the movie, he lives in a shed made from lumber, plywood, and plastic roofing, which is condemned and destroyed by Mr. Lahey, and a new one built to replace it. Lucy and Sarah's relationship/sexuality: In the TV series, Lucy and Sarah, both heterosexual, are simply old friends who share a trailer. In the movie, Lucy is ""one-eighth gay,"" and the two have had previous sexual encounters. Ricky and Lucy's marriage: At the end of the movie, Ricky and Lucy get married and go on to live together again. In the TV series, Ricky and Lucy were to get married in the first season finale, but the police shut down the ceremony to arrest Ricky and Julian. Ricky and Lucy then have an on-again/off-again relationship throughout the series without ever being married, even in episodes filmed after the movie or in the following movie. Lucy's boob job: In the TV series, Lucy got her breast implants from the money that Cory and Trevor took from the boys. In the movie, she got them from Sonny, the owner of the gentlemen's club. J-Roc's greasy films: In the TV series, J-Roc never succeeded in completing a greasy film, the titles of which are parodies of known titles. In the movie, J-Roc manages to complete a set of films, all of which contain the word ""hoes"" in the title."""

The same could be said about Ricky too.  Back then he was stupid, but relatively calm.

I don't mind Bubbles so much, but I see what you mean. He was never my favorite character. I like him and think he's funny, but even early on in the show it seems like they brought him in to make their writing seem a little more put together."

I'd have to say the only one keeping it og is J-Roc. Still love the show but man....petition to bring back Clattenburg?"

The whole Mocumentary style was what he held on to so much and what made the show so fun to watch and so believable at times from seasons 1-7. But ever since the boys have accrued the show that feeling has went away, and they've tried to replace it with over the top and new characters, and its just not the same.."

trailerparkboys,33wi9t,kwalterb,4,Mon Apr 27 22:38:17 2015 UTC,"conky sucks. he wasn't needed, i agree. the only part that is funny in that gag is ricky treating him like a human (pointing a gun at him and threatening him) but that is more ricky just being himself than anything else. Bubbles' development as a character is awesome imo over the series.  I enjoy that for seasons 8 and 9 he is the ""smart one"" who helps make all the plans happen.  that character development is a cool dimension for his character to have. after all this is ed edd and eddie for adults.  J-roc's lines are some of the best jokes on the show.   You touch on the characters being a little flat and under developed, but I feel that over time, with the problems they have had getting the seasons out there, its been a gradual increase in quality all the way until season nine where it got a little bit corny, but still watchable.  I believe the reason the show is so successful in what its doing is because they develop the characters just enough to keep people from being extremely bored with them and they switch out their narratives frequently.  There are the three lead characters, but it seems that everyone else except for Jim and Randy have an equally supporting role in the show.  Everyone gets their own sub plots and everyone seems to kind of be their own clique that gets a portion of the ""documentarian's"" time while they are filming in the park.  I think it gives the show its unique feel and makes the mundane and weird situations they get into more believable, lends to the joke of the show, and lets them get away without developing the characters as much as other shows.  its amazing. I love it."
trailerparkboys,33wi9t,w00dc0ck,2,Sun Apr 26 19:51:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, who writes Jroccs lines I wonder?  They're so good and of course different than all the other dialogue in the show."

trailerparkboys,33u60t,w00dc0ck,2,Sun Apr 26 13:31:44 2015 UTC,"I'd say;   check out the ""cart boy"" 1995 link, on the right sidebar of this subreddit. theres a good behind the scenes of tpb that shows mike clattenburg acting out a bubbles scene while giving direction, kinda makes me think he had alot of influence in bubble's early development.  i think it may be the tpb 101/hearts of dartmouth video. i think clattenburg directed ""cart boy"" too, which means the concept of bubbles predates ricky and julian (ricky and julian played mallcops in ""cart boy"") interviews and internet rumors with mike smith suggest the glasses were a joke gift from a friend, and some notion of bubbles may have been inspired by someone in his youth."
trailerparkboys,33u60t,uu_fasckira,0,Sun Apr 26 11:39:38 2015 UTC,I dont like J-Roc at all.... but he's one of the most rounded characters. You can chart a clear progression of his character as the seasons go on and he reacts in the most human (for J-Roc) manner at times.  Favourite character though? Ricky. Some of his scenes are absofuckinglutely priceless.
trailerparkboys,33u60t,Guernica27,0,Sat Apr 25 19:50:11 2015 UTC,"Yes! Finally I don't feel so alone.   Last time I said Jroc annoyed me a lot of the time I was downvoted. Don't get me wrong, he says some awesome shit sometimes, but I just can't stand his character. But that's just like my opinion,  man.   Now, Ricky. There's a guy I could watch all day. Some of the shit that comes out of his mouth is just too perfect and it never gets old for me."

(I'm a bot)     It's difficult to measure just how many sperm whales were affected, but one arresting photo of a rotting, burnt sperm whale carcass circulated widely after researchers saw the animal from a ship about 77 miles from the Deepwater Horizon site in June 2010.  A 2013 study of sperm whale skin samples found higher than usual levels of genotoxic metals in Gulf of Mexico whales after the spill, with the whales closest to the site of the spill with the highest levels.  A study published in August 2013 identified uncharacteristic whale shark sightings off the Florida Gulf of Mexico possibly connected to the spill, meaning the oil altered the fish's typical migratory paths.

trailerparkboys,33maco,M0TUS,2,Thu Apr 23 18:34:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah the Coruba bottle is very similar but the rum itself is darker than Coruba. Just remember noticing it was the same bottle as the barman took it off the shelf, didn't see the name at all."

I know what you mean though and kind of agree, but I'm just glad we got more and more on the way!"
trailerparkboys,33bt7s,deadering,2,Tue Apr 21 09:56:30 2015 UTC,i'm not sure why a number of folks focus on continuity and and perfect endings.  i like how every episode and movie ends for that episode or movie.  not too worried how it relates to the next one.
