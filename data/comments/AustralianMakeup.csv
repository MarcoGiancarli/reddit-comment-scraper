AustralianMakeup,3e61zt,SuperSixtyten,2,Wed Jul 22 06:46:59 2015 UTC,"Loving the level two samples - I feel like Mecca have really stepped up their game. I don't even wear lip gloss but I appreciate the fact that it's a deluxe sample sized NARS product (and I've never tried anything Chantecille so that's a nice thing to try). The other sample in the box is a teeny tiny sample of the By Terry Baum de Rose, a lip balm I've heard great things about but will never, ever buy because it's shockingly expensive, so it'll be nice to try. Level three box sounds awesome, though - I'd love to get the full details. I'm always like ""I could never spend that much in a year"" and yet here I am, level two."
AustralianMakeup,3e61zt,sarkata,1 point,Wed Jul 22 08:00:18 2015 UTC,I always say the same thing! Having discovered Soap & Glory is what's going to put me on to level 3 though I'm afraid haha

AustralianMakeup,3e1cd9,Tonkie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:12:28 2015 UTC,tbh the mecca prices are maybe 20% affected by sephora aus prices if that's what you mean by competitiveness? price reviews are inevitable because of how fast the dollar is dropping

AustralianMakeup,3e1cd9,Lunawinter,3,Tue Jul 21 11:47:17 2015 UTC,"There are a couple of companies that use similar services (EBays Global Shipping option for example) and I think, unfortunately, that their method of lower shipping costs is to actually re-package your parcel so that it weighs less  -  meaning that they are removing all of the protective stuffing that the seller has included that is adding weight.  Sadly, this means a lot of people  are ending up with damaged  items. Although, for non-easily damaged products, I  would probably use this! haha."
AustralianMakeup,3e1cd9,Shiavo,2,Tue Jul 21 14:55:11 2015 UTC,"This seems pretty interesting, but until I have more information about prices, then they seem pretty much the same as all the others!"

AustralianMakeup,3e1cd9,wildmareep,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:10:36 2015 UTC,"I use Stackry now. Their prices are pretty good, never had any issue with repackaging.

AustralianMakeup,3dx1i5,ladyhellcat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:44:23 2015 UTC,Yeah the brush guards I got were super cheap (got 5 packs of 10 for under $5) and it definitely keeps the brushes in shape!   I got the Pulp Fiction from this user. I think I paid about $30 including shipping? I'm not quite sure if she has anymore but you could try PMing her? :)
AustralianMakeup,3dx1i5,milkiebuttle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:52:23 2015 UTC,I have the exact same brushes! Seriously amazing quality considering their price. I bought a set of their eyeshadow brushes and they're equally as good.
AustralianMakeup,3dx78f,cherrybun,3,Mon Jul 20 07:35:01 2015 UTC,I believe they were discontinued unfortunately.
AustralianMakeup,3dx78f,WarlockPanda,2,Mon Jul 20 07:51:17 2015 UTC,So disappointing!! I didn't think they were unpopular at all.
AustralianMakeup,3dx78f,jamballdonut,4,Mon Jul 20 10:47:51 2015 UTC,"Wait, they were discontinued?! My local Priceline & Target still have heaps :/  But, you could always check eBay! They're generally listed at American prices (So between $8-12) and Revlon is too cheap of a brand for people to make fakes of, so no risk there! (I've bought some off eBay before with no problems :) )"
AustralianMakeup,3dx78f,pinkertongeranium,2,Mon Jul 20 08:45:42 2015 UTC,"They've completely gone!! I'm so disappointed, wishing I didn't hold off! I'll have a look around online :)"
AustralianMakeup,3dx78f,madefromrain,3,Mon Jul 20 10:46:46 2015 UTC,they still sell them at DJs and chemist warehouse!

AustralianMakeup,3dx78f,madefromrain,2,Mon Jul 20 21:43:01 2015 UTC,"They were discontinued to make way for the new HD lipsticks. If you check the clearance bins at priceline or target they may still have some but be aware, the target I work at had tons of stock when they were deleted but they've almost all sold because they went down to $7"
AustralianMakeup,3dx78f,mackinnon_13,2,Mon Jul 20 12:11:56 2015 UTC,Sad. I don't even like the HD ones all that much and the lip butters were my favourite.

AustralianMakeup,3dx78f,Neodymium,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:47:38 2015 UTC,"They came down quite a few months ago, but 4 weeks before something comes off the stand Target head office stops the orders, so stores wouldn't have received stock in a long time. The parfumerie nail polishes have only just been discontinued though."
AustralianMakeup,3dx78f,AceOfKittens,2,Mon Jul 20 14:26:09 2015 UTC,Just doubling up on the discontinued bandwagon. My Aunty is a merchandiser for Revlon and I was with her one day at work while she was pulling old stock. Waaah 😢 Berry Smoothie was one of my all time favourite lipsticks.
AustralianMakeup,3dx78f,torple-,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:09:03 2015 UTC,"Aww no! :( They had the best formula.  DJ's has a couple on sale, in case that's one of the shades you wanted? Neulook has a few too. I hope you manage to pick up the shades you were after!"
AustralianMakeup,3dwkl7,starward-,15,Mon Jul 20 03:18:42 2015 UTC,"Don't stop posting! I love there being new threads on here on the daily - it's great!  Now, my dream custom product is pretty simple and not fanciful at all I'm afraid. I just want a damn pink coral lipstick that fits the exact shade in my head - doesn't pull to orange, doesn't pull too pink. Not too dark, not too light, doesn't wash me out, not too pigmented, not too sheer.   DEAR GOD, I KEEP BUYING CORAL LIPSTICKS IN THE HOPES I WILL FIND THE ONE AND IT'S ALL FOR NOTHING!  I really wish I had access to a BITE Beauty Lab for this purpose - I could then die fulfilled instead of unhappy with 1000 not-quite-right coral lipsticks in my possession."
AustralianMakeup,3dwkl7,Jessijames,9,Mon Jul 20 04:35:19 2015 UTC,Have you considered melting them down and mixing them to try and get the colour you want? I had about 6 lipsticks that were just not quite right so I melted them down to create two new colours that I love! I also made one a much more workable stain and one somewhere between a lipstick and a lip gloss by adding paw paw ointment. Love it!
AustralianMakeup,3dwkl7,bears-bub,3,Mon Jul 20 07:05:09 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you enjoy them, I'd love if this sub was more active :D  And I'm like that with reds. I still haven't found THE ONE even if I've gotten close.   It would be so awesome if we had a BITE Beauty Lab though. Is it sad that's one reason NYC is on my must do list for America?"
AustralianMakeup,3dwkl7,lanadelghey,11,Mon Jul 20 05:57:17 2015 UTC,"I'd make my perfect foundation.  Natural matte.  Long lasting as hell.  Shade range from white to as dark as dark skin gets and EVERYTHING in between (warm, neutral, olive and cool tones at each level)  Waterproof  Full coverage  Never cakey!"
AustralianMakeup,3dwkl7,hellebora,5,Mon Jul 20 06:04:33 2015 UTC,"Perfect foundation for me too. Everything either turns orange, or flakes, or both even with a primer. Yellow undertones with pink skin problems."
AustralianMakeup,3dwkl7,lanadelghey,2,Mon Jul 20 09:16:53 2015 UTC,"Yes we need to make sure that it doesn't oxidise so it doesn't turn orange!!!! And it can have a special magical oil in it that makes it so it doesn't cling to flakes. It'll basically be witchcraft.   Off to Hogwarts to create it, I go! 😂"
AustralianMakeup,3dwkl7,lanadelghey,3,Mon Jul 20 09:23:48 2015 UTC,Ooh this sounds awesome! What are you calling it?
AustralianMakeup,3dwkl7,lanadelghey,3,Mon Jul 20 06:52:42 2015 UTC,"If Too Faced hadn't already stolen it, (because obviously THEEEY stole the name, not me!) I'd totally call it ""born this way"" because how perfect is that?! It really does just match the ski you're born with no matter what it is!   I think there's already something called Match Perfection, Perfect Match and True Match... So maybe ""the skin you're in?"" Nah that's too lame.  Maybe ""Natural Match"" (a play on Natural Matte?) would work? Too many possibilities!"
AustralianMakeup,3dwkl7,Rampachs,2,Mon Jul 20 06:55:55 2015 UTC,True Skin? Born This Way would be perfect though! I really wish I had this product now...
AustralianMakeup,3dwkl7,lanadelghey,2,Mon Jul 20 07:01:12 2015 UTC,"True Skin is good! But it reminds me of a sheer coverage foundation... Hmm.   Born this way would totally be! I wonder if their shades are light enough... I want to try it now!  I want my magical product, so so bad. Like, it needs to exist!"
AustralianMakeup,3dwkl7,nerdb1rd,4,Mon Jul 20 07:19:40 2015 UTC,And non-scented! I don't want my face to smell why are they making them smell this way?
AustralianMakeup,3dwkl7,alyss0r,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:38:38 2015 UTC,"Omg YES!   And good for sensitive and acne prone skin of course.   I LOVE the way my Illamasqua rich liquid smells (I'm not even sure what it smells like, but it smells sweet and delicious!), but that's because it goes away straight away. My ELF acne fighting isn't quite as kind to my nose-trils. Bleugh, tea tree oil smell on my face. I love that foundation though so I look past it."
AustralianMakeup,3dwkl7,breeerosee,11,Mon Jul 20 10:57:31 2015 UTC,"I'd make a holographic eyeshadow! Like, a proper full spectrum silvery eyeshadow with similar shift to this nail polish!"

AustralianMakeup,3dwkl7,rowha,5,Mon Jul 20 05:20:00 2015 UTC,You should try the Ultraceuticals Mattifying SPF30+ moisturiser.
AustralianMakeup,3dwkl7,Jessijames,4,Mon Jul 20 12:43:23 2015 UTC,I want this too!! It would be amazing.
AustralianMakeup,3dwkl7,WhoopWindshear,9,Mon Jul 20 06:01:24 2015 UTC,My custom item would be a duochrome lipstick (I used that example for a reason haha). I want something with a super strong duochrome that changes from bright red to dark purple. How awesome would that be? I would have a completely metallic silver bullet that would be totally impervious to fingerprints or scratches and it wind completely down so I wouldn't keep nicking it when I closed it.  The formula would be creamy and non-drying but of course have amazing lasting power.
AustralianMakeup,3dwkl7,hankdiggles,9,Mon Jul 20 03:21:38 2015 UTC,"Oh the possibilities if this were real!    For me, it'd be a mascara that thickens, lengthens, holds curl (and simultaneously curls lashes without the need to use a lash curler), doesn't look spidery, lasts all day, is waterproof, and easily removed with makeup remover. The wand would also be small enough to reach the baby lashes at the ends of the eye and bottom lashes."
AustralianMakeup,3dwkl7,Segat1,2,Mon Jul 20 04:06:48 2015 UTC,Now that is a good custom. What would you call it? :)

Oh you've gotten a tiny bit darker in the spring but not enough to warrant a new product because you'll get darker in the summer but your winter shade is too light?? Sure, my new foundation can get that tiny bit darker!   Oh, your olive tones are becoming more apparent in the fall because that's just want your skin does?? Sure, my new foundation can do that!   As you can probably tell I've had quite a frustrating time with foundation and a miracle product like this would get all of my monies."
AustralianMakeup,3dwkl7,Shiavo,2,Mon Jul 20 06:43:36 2015 UTC,That would be amazing! It's like what those stupid colour matching ball things were supposed to do (like that was fooling anybody)
AustralianMakeup,3dwkl7,torple-,4,Mon Jul 20 06:53:51 2015 UTC,"I've been obsessing over the perfect travel-friendly makeup for a long trip I'm about to take, so my dream items at the moment would be:   A really small, lightweight yet sturdy eyeshadow palette containing a range of high quality shadows in a mix of neutral mattes and shimmers. I have my housemate picking up the Smashbox Full Exposure Travel Palette from the US this month (of course not available in Australia); I've heard the shimmer shades are a bit too glittery and have some fallout, but it's the closest I've found so I'm giving it a go.  A stick foundation (so it doesn't count towards the stupid liquids restrictions on flights) that actually sits smoothly on my skin, and is SPF30. I got the Bloom one in my Lust Have It box the other month but it is a bit thick and makes my skin look flaky (might be worth trying again in summer).    This is the dream!!!"
AustralianMakeup,3dwkl7,Crumpet92,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:03:50 2015 UTC,"Good luck with your trip!!  Both of those sound like awesome items!

AustralianMakeup,3dxnuw,Amorbellevie,2,Mon Jul 20 14:36:53 2015 UTC,"I have heard girls say this set comes out here in September, and the other matte lipsticks come out in August. But it would be helpful if someone from MAC could confirm on here :)"
AustralianMakeup,3dxnuw,underelectriclight,3,Tue Jul 21 00:47:23 2015 UTC,"We even haven't been given an actual date for these yet, didn't even have the samples to play with back in May when they were talked about in our product update meeting :( Looking in my book it just says North America - 2nd July / International August 2015 but these are always subject to change. Will keep you guys in the loop as soon as I know!"
AustralianMakeup,3dxnuw,ladyhellcat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:23:12 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for clarifying :) Yeah I would guess those are probably the reasons they don't tell you a date. Kind of a bummer but keep us updated!
AustralianMakeup,3dwoh6,idealgrind,3,Mon Jul 20 03:56:19 2015 UTC,"I had this question about 2 years ago :) I think the problem with the Isocool in the green bottle is that it's too dilute (around 20-30%?). I found 100% isopropyl alcohol in a spray bottle in Big W (hardware section, Bunnings will also have it). Then you can just dilute with water to your preferred dilution."
AustralianMakeup,3dwoh6,ex_circus_geek,2,Mon Jul 20 04:04:28 2015 UTC,Isocol is 50-70% v/v isopropyl alcohol
AustralianMakeup,3dwoh6,SEXPILUS,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:01:13 2015 UTC,Awesome! However I'm hearing mixed things about Isocol - their website says its 100%!?! Which doesn't really make sense to me. Then others say it's 70%....

AustralianMakeup,3dwoh6,SEXPILUS,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:16:08 2015 UTC,But thanks also for the Big W/Bunnings suggestion! Seems like that might be the way to go and just dilute it :)
AustralianMakeup,3dwoh6,starward-,2,Mon Jul 20 05:11:58 2015 UTC,I found some at Priceline and also at any supermarket. I use the brand Isocol. It is in a green bottle and has a crocodile on the front. From memory it was around $10. I am not sure what percentage it is though. You can find it in the medical area because rubbing alcohol can be used as an antiseptic. I have seen it used in a video that was pressing an eyeshadow.
AustralianMakeup,3dwoh6,SEXPILUS,2,Mon Jul 20 04:53:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I'm familiar with the Isocol bottle. However, I've heard mixed things about whether it is 70% or 100%. The website says 100% but others are saying its 70%?! Weird. I'd be happy to dilute it if it was 100, but I just need to be sure...       At lease if you've seen it in a video then it should work!"
AustralianMakeup,3dwoh6,Jessijames,3,Mon Jul 20 05:09:13 2015 UTC,"The MSDS for Isocol says it can be anywhere from 50-70% v/v.  Edit: I just realised what your confusion is. The Icsocol spray is 100%, the Isocol Multipurpose Solution is 50-70%."

AustralianMakeup,3dvm9j,bloodbuzzz,5,Sun Jul 19 22:15:13 2015 UTC,"Does the Master Precise liner even come in a brown range to begin with? If so, perhaps an entire batch was mis-labelled and shipped out to stores and your local store got the brunt of it? I would go with formula change but that could be an explanation as well.  Post on Maybelline's facebook page and see what they have to say!"
AustralianMakeup,3dvm9j,Jessijames,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:30:28 2015 UTC,"Ah yeah I'm not sure if it comes in brown, but I'll suss it out because that could explain it maybe.

AustralianMakeup,3dvm9j,-eternal_sunshine-,5,Mon Jul 20 00:43:16 2015 UTC,"okay this may not be relevant but bear with me.   So I bought the Master Graphic Maybelline liner and when I first used it, it came out in a weird, watery browny-grey colour which was completely useless - I got it on sale and wrote it off as a crap product and moved on.   About three weeks later I tried it again and it was opaque, perfect black that stayed on properly, and wasn't watery or brown at all. In fact, it was awesome.   I don't know if that helps you. But yeah, maybe let it... sit? and ... see? I don't know."

AustralianMakeup,3dtgzc,starward-,3,Sun Jul 19 08:07:55 2015 UTC,"Cross-posted from /r/indiemakeupandmore!  So I am quite partial to Shiro Cosmetics' Alkahestry eyeshadow and I decided to pour my sample into Australis' Colour Inject clear gloss. It combined really well into the gloss and I'm really happy with the result. It worked out well because I'm impatient and so I didn't have to wait for international shipping, and I won't lie it was also much cheaper than getting a custom gloss from Shiro considering conversion and shipping.   However this gloss formula isn't as good as the Shiro ones I have tried (though I certainly don't have an extensive collection or anything) and it feels somewhat gritty if I rub my lips together, plus as you can probably see it does settle into my lip lines somewhat following application if I am wearing it solo. All in all though I would definitely try this again (and /u/DarkHatexx was actually kind enough to help hook me up with more glosses so I can try it again!)  FYI I included the last two photos for completeness but they are copied over from my EC liquid matte swatch album so apologies if they seem a bit out of place!   Edit: forgot to include some stuff"

NARS eyeshadow base is $35 and I don't like the wand applicator - when I take so long to get through a product, I want something that can last!   I checked out Kit and was tempted by Shadow insurance, when I saw the duo. It's cheaper and you can two bottles, one of which is shimmery. Awesome.  Edit: also, maybe not a bargain... but if you're looking to buy some and you like mid end products, this is pretty amazing. Keeps my eyeshadow looking flawless even after a 5k run!"

AustralianMakeup,3dpy26,YesToCatsNoToBrats,3,Sat Jul 18 08:34:17 2015 UTC,"Personally, I find palettes with too many colours in them to be overkill. I ended up going with the Marc Jacobs one as it had one contour and one highlight shade and it met my needs. But if you're looking to JUST contour, have you thought about the Nars contour shades? They also come with a bit of highlight."
AustralianMakeup,3dpy26,gospursgo_,2,Sat Jul 18 08:50:25 2015 UTC,"I second the getting a palette with a single contour shade, you don't end up using the others. I don't have pale skin so can't recommend any specific products but can say from experience that it's better to get a small duo with one shade that'll work as your contour rather than getting a large palette with many shades that won't work for you."

Umm, i love their velvet matte lip pencils, audacious lipsticks, i use the weightless fohndation but foundation experience tends to vary from person to person. Also love their pore refining primer, i got a sample and definitely wanna buy the large version. Also use an eyeshadow as my daily contouring and crease colour but unfortunately I'm pretty sure it doesn't come in a single :( its a real bummer because its the most perfect cool toned, matte, purple-based taupe.

AustralianMakeup,3dped8,freezethefire,2,Sun Jul 19 03:44:37 2015 UTC,"Mac cream colour base!!! They have some really light shades and are sooooo easy to just pat into the skin, even over powder!"

AustralianMakeup,3dped8,louise_sophie,2,Sun Jul 19 03:38:28 2015 UTC,"so many shades, but my mac only had two colours in stock lol. Ended up with Shell which is a gorgeous pinky colour, but the base colour doesnt really show up on my nc20-25 skin just the most beautiful glow. i really really love it, not to mention its a great product for 'strobing' if thats your thing, and lasts so well on the skin"
AustralianMakeup,3dped8,Esoterria,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:02:42 2015 UTC,"Just looked it up again and turns out I was on the UK website :( Aus website only had one shade online. So I'm not sure, I think I'll head into MAC and see what they have. 'Shell' is beautiful! The UK website has one called 'Pearl' which I really hope I can have a look at."
AustralianMakeup,3dped8,louise_sophie,2,Sun Jul 19 04:23:54 2015 UTC,"They definitely carry pearl, Luna, shell and hush but they're so popular they sell out and take ages to restock apparently (at one of the Perth stores anyway) seriously worth making a trip to Mac for!"

AustralianMakeup,3dped8,starla_,2,Sun Jul 19 07:37:47 2015 UTC,For something matte I like the Maybelline fit me sticks with something shimmery over the top in a more concentrated placement :)
AustralianMakeup,3dped8,starla_,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:52:05 2015 UTC,I actually bought these last year! Loved the colours but something about the formula didn't work for me. I found they were really thin and transparent. Are you having any problems like that with them? I ended up giving them to a family member.
AustralianMakeup,3dped8,laurenannika1,2,Sun Jul 19 03:35:52 2015 UTC,"Nope, Im using them for contour though not foundation so maybe its sheer as foundation? I've never had any problems, they're super easy to blend though so maybe you were blending them out too much? Could just be different formulas in the different colours though... Wish I could help!"
AustralianMakeup,3dookl,idealgrind,6,Sat Jul 18 00:13:13 2015 UTC,"UPDATE: Thank you SO much for all your recommendations, guys! A few of you recommended the Boujois Healthy Mix Foundation. After reading a few other reviews and YouTube videos, I think this is going to be my first try! I'm going for shade #52 Vanilla as /u/seenoright suggested and I think from the swatches shown on  this blog it should suit me well.    Can't believe it's only $19.50 on ASOS compared to $32 from Priceline! Can't wait to try it out. Otherwise, I'm also keen to try out your other suggestions, you've all been super helpful, thank you :)"

AustralianMakeup,3dookl,joulia09,4,Sat Jul 18 03:52:23 2015 UTC,definitely take a look at the bourjois healthy mix/healthy mix serum foundations as they are both highly recommended pharmacy foundations

AustralianMakeup,3dookl,louise_sophie,3,Sat Jul 18 02:51:35 2015 UTC,"Apologies in advance for bad mobile formatting and a massive answer. I have the same sort of problem at the moment, my skin has suddenly become drier for the first time, not really dry, but enough to make many of my foundations feel a bit off, like you described. Im an NC15 in studio fix, but own several different foundations so I've been playing around with what feels best at the moment for day to day wear.  1) Primer is still really important, creates that blank slate you need for even application, im pretty partial to the rimmel stay matte, as I feel it fills pores, keeps my tzone in place, but doesnt dry out my skin. On really dry days however, I like the Face of Australia primer in the purple tube, nice base for foundation, doesn't do a lot for my pores unfortunately.  2) Skincare routine; such a personal thing, and you've mentioned that you're slowly changing it, which does take time. I've found that incorporating an oil in the last step of my routine (pat oil over moisturiser to lock it in) at night has been helping. If you have time before your makeup, putting moisturiser on 10-20 mins before primer can help combat dryness ( I personally never have enough time to do this)  3) Foundation! Okay, so you've mentioned 3 foundations that I own; Studio fix and colourstay are so similar in consistency that I find they both tend to have the same problem you're experiencing, wouldn't recommend for this problem, would recommend it as a lower cost alternative to mac. Rimmel stay matte is very very matte, so much so that I have problems with even application when my skin is oilier, if you have even the smallest dry patch, it will stick. I wouldn't recommend it at the moment.  Foundations I have that I would recommend: Maybelline FitMe in the liquid formula (I use shade 110), not the stick. I usually prefer the stick, but not at the moment because of the dryness. Mid coverage, lasting power can be a bit variable.  Rimmel Match Perfection (I use shade 81): this foundation is a nice everyday foundation, particularly at the moment (I sometimes have trouble with longevity if im oily) but does not offer as much coverage as Studio fix; Rimmel wake me up also seems to be popular in this sub and makeupaddiction.  Revlon nearly naked is my current favourite ( I wear vanilla) it gives nice mid coverage, works well with my primer and doesn't stick, I find that it lasts fairly well during the day and hasn't looked cakey or weird with my drier skin.  Hopefully that huge block of text made some sense, and offers a little help!"
AustralianMakeup,3dookl,seenoright,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:07:14 2015 UTC,"Argh you've been such a help! Thanks for the thorough recommendations, I seriously do appreciate it! Re: the primer recommendations - I haven't tried either of those yet, but have heard good things about the Face of Australia one. I'm sure the pore thing won't be too much of an issue, as that side of skincare has been improving with my new routine. I'm definitely looking to combat the dryness more. I completely agree re: skincare. /r/skincareaddiction has honestly helped me so much! I do pat oil over my moisturiser SOME nights, but should really do this more frequently or consider using an occlusive to 'lock-in' my moisturiser. I'll take this into consideration over the next few weeks when I'm comfortable enough to start adding and changing things again :) I might go try the fit me liquid, match perfection and nearly naked at the same time, have a walk around the shopping centre and see how I eel about them. I think based off of the suggestions here I'll definitely give Stay Matte a miss until at least summer or when my routine has combatted my dryness a little more :) Thank you so much, again <3"

Some shades aren't what I would like them to be but I'm assuming it's because I used too much binder. Good luck!

AustralianMakeup,3dlcec,Pandibabi,8,Fri Jul 17 05:07:06 2015 UTC,"That's a tough call IMO.  I personally wouldn't buy it myself, but I think considering you say it looks 'factory sealed' it's probably more likely to be safer that any products that are not. A helluva lot of 'flea market' cosmetics I've seen are not factory sealed in any way and that alone gives me the heebie jeebies.  I would also want to consider if you think it's just older stock of merchandise/brands that were/are sold here - eg. it's old Maybelline quads/lipsticks/powders whatever that have just had the labels peeled off them. If they're easily recognisable via their packaging as a reputable brand and it's factory sealed it should be 'fine' providing you're okay with putting potentially out of date cosmetics on your face - similar to what Gloss stores or those kiosk stalls in most malls stock although even they don't remove any branding they just sell them as is.  If they're in packaging that you've never seen before here in stores or cannot recognise the likelihood of it being imported and from random brands is much higher and the risk in my opinion would be greater and the ingredient contents could be dangerous. 100% 'Unbranded' items in general are dodgy at best.  If it was say, last seasons L'Oreal with the 'L'Oreal' labels removed, factory sealed & easily identifiable (which is highly unlikely the more I think about it) then I'd consider it as the odds of it being genuine product and not expired or only recently expired would be higher, but still not a guarantee.   At the end of the day, I'm not one to tell somebody what to or not do, if it's a risk you're willing to take it's up to you to decide if you're comfortable purchasing & wearing the makeup."
AustralianMakeup,3dlcec,Jessijames,3,Fri Jul 17 05:25:48 2015 UTC,Upvote for use of heebie jeebies (and other good advice).
AustralianMakeup,3dlcec,kellyyyllek,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:42:11 2015 UTC,I didn't know that Gloss stores sold out of date products :( I bought the maybelline age rewind concealer from Gloss and I think it's fine :s How can you tell a product is out of date?
AustralianMakeup,3dlcec,mononooke,7,Fri Jul 17 07:10:56 2015 UTC,"'Out of date' is probably a poor choice of words. They don't have an expiry date in the way that something like a bottle of milk does. Essentially most of the products sourced by Gloss and the like are 2, 3, 4 5 seasons old  and therefore can be up to 3-4 years old if  it older. They don't go 'rotten' as such, but the quality of a product that has sat on a shelf for 3-4 years untouched won't be as good as it was when it was 'newly' manufactured (I'm no expert but products on say Priceline shelves should or would be no older than 2 years from manufacturing date).   Take the Maybelline mineral range, how long has it been since you've seen that in stores (I know it's recently been revamped and re-released I'm not counting this)? I haven't seen it in Priceline/Target etc for YEARS and every Gloss I've been to in just as long has had it, they would have bought thousands and thousands of units at a discounted rate from the suppliers once it was discontinued so they can resell it at a cheaper rate in their stores. Think about it, the majority of lines they carry are no longer on shelves in regular retailers."
AustralianMakeup,3dijos,bbaek,2,Thu Jul 16 15:37:39 2015 UTC,What are your favourite products from Sasa.com? I've never shopped with them. Off to check out their offerings!
AustralianMakeup,3dijos,SchultzAL,4,Fri Jul 17 05:26:15 2015 UTC,"They specialise more in Asian Beauty brands but they do have familiar high end brands too like Dior, Chanel and YSL. The higher ends usually tend to be cheaper than Myers/DavidJones like the Chanel ROUGE COCO Hydrating Crème Lip Colour is $52 in Aus but on sasa it's sold for $40.   One of my favourite mascaras is the Heroine Make (Kiss Me)- Volume & Curl Mascara Super Waterproof, it's hard to get off though since it is super waterproof. I also like Clinique* dramatically different moisturising lotion (you can get it here but it's a tad cheaper at sasa and they have the 200ml size) and the My Beauty Diary masks (they're sheet masks) are a favourite too.   Brands that are also a fave are Etude House, Majolica Majorca, Banila Co, Skin Foods, Tony Moly (they don't have a lot of Tony Moly makeup, more skincare), 3 Concept Eyes (lip pigments are very popular) and Innisfree (love their volcano pore clay mask).   Edit: Also if you're on the paler side, try looking at foundations and bb creams. I have the Etude BB cream in the  darkest shade and it's still a tad too light for me.  Edit2: Forgot to mention the lotion was Clinique"
AustralianMakeup,3dijos,ehcn,3,Fri Jul 17 08:39:03 2015 UTC,"Awesome! I ended up placing an order of mostly sheet masks, a HA lotion, and some loose powders. I'm an NW10, and have a ton of Asian BB creams, so I didn't order any more of those, haha."

AustralianMakeup,3dhnd6,Tonkie,2,Thu Jul 16 10:15:53 2015 UTC,Haven't tried to Ren products so probably won't take up that offer.  But I went was at Mecca maxima last week and didn't know about the nail polish but was offered a choice of purple (lavender/fuschia) end of dark blue. I got the purple and it is gorgeous.  I hadn't tried Kit nail polishes before but this one has sold me they are on par with Essie and similar price.
AustralianMakeup,3dhnd6,Tough_Princess,2,Thu Jul 16 10:27:37 2015 UTC,Really I have a bunch of Kit mini polishes and while I love the colours I just don't think they last very long in comparison to many of my other brands.
AustralianMakeup,3dhnd6,WarlockPanda,2,Thu Jul 16 10:32:51 2015 UTC,Maybe I have very low standards lol.  since I have a very manual labour job so if it stays three days I'm happily surprised.  But as for formula it's nice and creamy no streaking and settled well.

Their blushes look amazing; I want to make up a palette - they have a great contour shade as well. From what I know, their eyeshadows are closer to the typical Japanese formulas in that they're definitely pretty, but more sheer than they look in the pan.   It's funny because I recently went to Singapore and got very excited about going to the Surratt counter there. I didn't get any makeup but I did walk away with one of their cheek brushes. It was ludicrously expensive but it's my favourite brush of all time, and if we get the brushes here I will absolutely buy another one (and probably the rest of them, too)."

AustralianMakeup,3dgviq,cherryberry88,6,Thu Jul 16 04:17:08 2015 UTC,"According to Temptalia, these were released in 2010 so I imagine they are very very old stock that gloss has manged to pick up. I wouldn't risk it if I were you."
AustralianMakeup,3dgviq,WarlockPanda,3,Thu Jul 16 04:24:06 2015 UTC,"Yep, OP /u/WarlockPanda is right this is ancient stock. I'd hazard a guess and say it is genuine, but obviously quite old (in make-up terms anyway) which is why they've been able to get their hands on it for cheap. It's the kind of stuff that places like Strawberry Net & All Cosmetics Wholesale stock."
AustralianMakeup,3dgviq,Jessijames,2,Thu Jul 16 04:33:49 2015 UTC,It seems really annoying that they came in those containers instead of jars. Did you ever use them? Did they go everywhere when applying?
AustralianMakeup,3dgviq,starward-,2,Thu Jul 16 06:22:52 2015 UTC,"I've not ever used them no, I believe from seeing pictures they may have a sponge tip wand within the tube like those old maybelline or whichever brand had loose powdered shadow in a pot with a wand similar to the liquid liner style - but with a sponge/doe foot. Because of the doe foot they don't really fly everywhere, it's not a helluva lot different to just using a brush with loose powder really!"

As long as you're using a good base preferably a cream product it will adhere well eg. Maybelline Colour Tattoos, MAC Paint Pots, or a good shadow primer.

AustralianMakeup,3dfi7a,pondicus,4,Thu Jul 16 01:11:20 2015 UTC,Ahh Costco. Do I need a bulk moisturiser that I will only use 5 times? SURE WHY NOT.  Melbourne's lovely - must be SO cold this time of year though :(

You're so right about Costco...I always walk out of there with the most random things, last time I went with my housemate our eyes were bigger than our stomachs and we ended up buying one of those HUGE black forest cakes to share...share between 2 people, greeeeat idea....  I do buy the bulk packs of the Johnson's baby shampoo from them though for my brushes, it generally works out well priced!"
AustralianMakeup,3dfi7a,starward-,2,Thu Jul 16 01:18:16 2015 UTC,I once bought makeup removing wipes. Did they break me out the first time I tried them? Yes.

AustralianMakeup,3dh6qf,drunkerxx,4,Thu Jul 16 06:19:40 2015 UTC,"I've been on accutane and exfoliating is a serious no no! Your skin is thin and sensitive, you could end up doing more harm than good. Cetaphyl is great. My dermatologist also gave me a BB/sunnscreen/all in one cream however I can't remember the brand of it.  Have you tried Too Faced poreless primer? There's an oil free version and I find that holds well on my combo skin."

Unfortunately I've not been on Accutane myself, nor do I know of anyone that has I could ask. I do believe Jodi from GooRooBeauty on Youtube did go on it a couple of years ago and did a whole bunch of videos speaking about her experiences and as a beauty vlogger I'm fairly certain she spoke about her use of makeup in conjunction with the medication as well as her skincare routine at the time - you may find something useful on her channel? They were extremely informative from memory and she's a great vlogger!  Here's a link to her channel!"

I'm kind of a foundation queen and if you like I can send you a few samples of some of mine as well as a couple of primers that might work on your skin? I can pop them in small sachet bags and post them out to you if you like? It might save you buying loads of different products in search of the perfect one! Xx

AustralianMakeup,3dh6qf,thelostwhore,3,Fri Jul 17 22:35:56 2015 UTC,"I don't mind at all sugar, I have some great hydrating water-based BB creams and a few different mineral foundations and loads of other stuff so just let me know if you want to try any :) I also found that using two different foundations was really helpful, from memory they were just maybelline ones but one was an oil-free mattifying and the other was a hydrating, because they were from the same brand it meant I could get the same shade in each formula so it worked really well for me."
AustralianMakeup,3dh6qf,NirvanahCrane,5,Fri Jul 17 23:30:41 2015 UTC,"Get off the clarisonic unless your dermatologist has told you otherwise.  I would use a mineral base foundation and lay off cover your face in heavy foundations. The reason youre on accutane in thr first place is to get amazing skin! If you really need to,  blend some hwavier foundations in with your Cetaphil moisturiser to give a light coverage then go over with a powder.  Accutane is a serious drug to be taking and you shoukd be doing everything your dermatologist tells you."
AustralianMakeup,3dh6qf,NirvanahCrane,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:12:21 2015 UTC,My dermatologist said that it shouldn't be a problem to use?  I'll ask him again at my next checkup though
AustralianMakeup,3dh6qf,minnie_the_minx,2,Thu Jul 16 11:00:27 2015 UTC,Clairasonic wpukd be way too strong on accutane. Youre not supposed to use any thing exfoliating during the process as i recall from my cousin being on it.
AustralianMakeup,3dh6qf,NirvanahCrane,2,Thu Jul 16 13:59:23 2015 UTC,"I'd seriously lay off the Clarisonic- there will be waaay too much cell turnover going on with being on Accutane. That will be one reason why things are not sitting nicely. Accutane speeds up cell turnover, and Clarisonic is just way too much when you are blasting your skin from the inside as well.   I'd stick with the Cetaphil and sunscreen (great work there) and look at a mineral foundation product. I really like a brand called Vani-T that I get through my skin lady, they have both liquid and powder mineral foundations and I find them fantastic for my poor blasted skin. I've been on Accutane three times, am still battling with hormonal acne and this is the only foundation product that looks half-pie decent on my skin."

AustralianMakeup,3dh6qf,snailor,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:18:50 2015 UTC,"Hi darlin Hope I'm not imposing but I was wondering if you've tried the contraceptive pill to help with your acne? I've used accutane twice, when I was 20 and then again at 22. I was absolutely overjoyed the first time because I thought that my skin woes had finally been beaten as I'd struggled with bad acne since my early teens. The accutane gave me clear skin which lasted for approximately two months after stopping, but then my acne slowly crept back in gutted. The same thing happened the second time around. I'm in my 30's now and I've come to accept the fact that I'll never have perfect skin but I find that using Yasmin has been my best option as I can take it long term unlike accutane and while I still get the occasional breakout my skin is nowhere near as bad as was in the past. When I get a breakout I use Duac which is a topical antibiotic and that really helps to keep things under control. I've literally tried everything and anything over the years and so far this regime seems to be the best in regards to my crazy hormonal acne."
AustralianMakeup,3dh6qf,snailor,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:05:01 2015 UTC,"I've been on the Pill since I was 16- damn PCOS for my acne! Unfortunately for my skin, babies are on the cards in the near future, so off I came and am trying to manage it with skincare and diet. Not as great as the pill or Accutane, but its going ok. As soon as babies are done though, back on the Pill though!"
AustralianMakeup,3dh6qf,tulipsandpolish,2,Mon Jul 20 08:53:49 2015 UTC,"I've been on accutane. Are you wanting to use this to get rid of oil? Mine made my skin painfully dry- so much so, that applying moisturiser hurt. But I did get rid of my small amount of acne- and it gave me amazingly matte skin which I got the hang of looking after with the right moisturisers. But 4 months after finishing my treatment my skin has gone back to oily (no acne tho). Now I just concentrate on skincare for the health of my skin, and use oil remover wipes and rice powder two times a day when my face becomes very oily. Have you checked out r/skincareaddiction ? that is a good place to start if you want to look into skincare more :)"

AustralianMakeup,3dh6qf,mr-snrub-,2,Thu Jul 16 10:59:56 2015 UTC,"I was on accutane for a year and my biggest piece of advice would be to stop using the clarisonic. I hardly ever exfoliated when on roaccutane - maybe once a month.  I loved Boujours Healthy Mix Foundation (not serum) when I was on it. You haven't mentioned what cleanser you use but if it's for acne prone skin stop, and use something incredibly gentle. I used the Aveeno positively radiant range."

AustralianMakeup,3dh6qf,minnie_the_minx,2,Fri Jul 17 02:16:49 2015 UTC,Haven't been on Accutane but I am on Epiduo (topical). What I found helped alleviate the dryness was lots of layers of hydrating products - I follow an AB routine with lota of snail products. Makeup wise I would rec going for water-based products as I find silicone products such as Benefit's porefessional make dry skin look like poop. Also grab a hydrating spray to mist your face with during the day - make sure there's no alcohol in it.

AustralianMakeup,3dgsqu,NocturnalNightingale,5,Thu Jul 16 03:51:17 2015 UTC,"I'll probably recommend Bourjois Healthy Mix (normal-oily skin) or Healthy Serum (normal-dry) skin til the cows come home, and I'm recommending it again. Both have a nice light-medium coverage that's buildable and easy to use with your fingers. The finish is velvety - not too dewy, not too matte.  It's a bit pricier than your average drugstore foundation, but I think it's on par with most mid/high-range brands like NARS and Chanel (two other brands I've used). Their lightest shade is #51 and they tend to run very yellow compared to other brands. I'm not sure if the shade will match you, but it might?  Otherwise, Revlon tends to be the ol' reliable around these parts as far as I know. Their Nearly Naked line might be a good fit..?  Edit - grammarrrrghhh"
AustralianMakeup,3dgsqu,pondicus,3,Thu Jul 16 04:11:53 2015 UTC,"Seconding the Healthy Mix Serum Gel. I have redness in my skin too, and that foundation covers the majority of it nicely. Of course I have to go and conceal under my eyes and some old scarring, but for the most part, it performs really well. I do need to powder my t-zone well though, as I do get pretty oily."
AustralianMakeup,3dgsqu,MiniOliebol,3,Thu Jul 16 04:25:46 2015 UTC,"The only thing with this foundation OP is that the shade range may not suit you. The Rimmel Match Perfection is only a hair darker than my NW10 skin and is a great shade match for me (barely noticeable) and the lightest shade in the Bourjois is far too dark for me to even think about using. /u/pondicus is definitely right about it being very yellow toned, I lean very pink undertoned so that's why it doesn't work for me but it might just suit you!  Swatch it and see how you go, I've heard the formula is great!! :)  EDIT: I would also strongly recommend the Revlon Nearly Naked range. The foundation is pretty excellent for a light-medium coverage!"
AustralianMakeup,3dgsqu,Jessijames,2,Thu Jul 16 04:31:28 2015 UTC,"I've been browsing Bourjois a lot, but my local pricelines haven't had this brand. I'll definitely check it out and swatch! I'm a pretty yellow olive, so I think it might fit. I've tried Revlon, but it seems to dark/pinky when I swatched it. If I can find it on a good sale, I'll try it out for sure to test it properly. Thanks for your suggestions!"

I find revlon colorstay and Estée Lauder double wear can look thick and cakes but this concoction has just as much coverage but looks so damn natural. And it lasts.  I really need to order the healthy mix serum to try with the drops.

If you're grabbing a sample set, the vol 1 neutrals are more suitable for paler skin tones IIRC - they are actually lighter than they appear in the photos at least on my monitor so I would recommend googling some swatches.  The good thing about Blackbird is the shades come in loose and pressed formulas! So if you're not comfortable with loose eyeshadows you can always grab the pressed version. I personally haven't tried the pressed ones. However I do have one shade in the new formula and it is really pigmented, soft and blendable.    Another really great brand is Dawn Eyes Cosmetics. Shipping is always accurate and Dawn will refund you if she ends up paying less. Another thing is that while the shipping isn't crazy cheap, the actual products are very reasonably priced. Their spearl mattes come really highly recommended and honestly all of Dawn's shadows are just beautiful. I'd look up swatches and go from there but every colour of Dawn's I've tried has been an instant love for me.  The caveat with DEC is that their website is AWFUL. It's like a bad 90s trip. But Dawn will also just invoice you for the colours you want if you shoot her an email. So if you don't want to brave her site that's another option!  Another option for people who are starting out with indies is Shiro Cosmetics. Generally Shiro is recommended to beginners simply because they've got a very easy to browse website, a really large colour range, and flat rate shipping. So you can haul to your hearts content. Their sample sizes are also huge (Blackbird is much smaller in comparison - I can take a photo of a sample of each side by side if you want to visualise the differences!). The formula I'd say isn't as good as Dawn Eyes (this is 100% my subjective opinion and YMMV), but it's decent. There's nothing wrong with it but it's also not particularly special either. This doesn't necessarily count as an earthy green, but Diggy Diggy Hole may be up your alley (personally this is one of my favourite Shiro shadows out of my collection. It swatches a bit lighter brown than pictured IMO and the green shift is quite strong). Burdened With Glorious Purpose may also float your boat.  Another option - Femme Fatale Cosmetics. Aussie based, but shipping is via Aus Post rates but you'll be avoiding the seriously crap conversion rates right now. FF have amazing duochromes and I'd definitely recommend checking out their whole range too. The fun thing about FF is they also stock other brands, such as Shiro! So you could grab a bit of everything while you're at it.   In terms of lipsticks - there aren't many indie lipstick options. You'll find tinted balms more commonly (and some are pigmented enough that they pretty much are lipsticks, just with less wear time). One option I'd recommend if you like liquid mattes is Eccentric Cosmetics. I find my liquid mattes from there less drying than my mainstream but I think this is a very much YMMV. Also i feel I should be upfront in that you won't get the same infallible wear with indies. The reason I left EC until last is because they also do eyeshadows and are currently running a free shipping promotion! So it kinda fulfills all your criteria. Also, I love their primer. Whatever shadow primer you use now will probably be fine for daily wear but the reason I like EC's is that I find it tends to bring out the colour of my shadows really well (way better than the admittedly cheap primers I'd tried before). But if you are shopping indie and hoping for really amazing looking duochromes, some kind of glitter fixative will be necessary. I can totally recommend you some options for that too but I don't want to overwhelm you. Anyway shadow recommendations from EC - Walkers (it isn't an earthy green as such but the green shift is super strong. Like even without primer. Opening the jar actually made me go wow!) and Nomad might also be up your alley. I'd also recommend sending a message to Anna explaining what colours you're after - she's really good at picking stuff IME and tbh I find sometimes her etsy photos aren't 100% true to life (though this could be monitor settings etc).   Whoo sorry for the massive wall, let me know if you've got any questions :)"
AustralianMakeup,3d8fp3,gospursgo_,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:51:57 2015 UTC,I honestly can't rave about Blackbird enough......
AustralianMakeup,3d8fp3,gospursgo_,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:58:09 2015 UTC,"Okay, this is amazing! I've been itching to get the time to go through this and check everything!   I definitely need to get my hands on Vintage and Fire Pledge. DEC's mossy mauve also looks beautiful, and I need Burdened With Glorious Purpose...  I stumbled on False Astronomy by EC, wow... I'm thinking I'll grab one of those 10 shadow sample packs, everything there is just so pretty.  Thank you so much for all that detail and info, it's fantastic! I'm going to be so damn poor. :D"
AustralianMakeup,3d8fp3,gospursgo_,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:42:08 2015 UTC,"No worries at all, I'm so glad you've already found colours you want (I waffled so much on my first indie purchases haha). I'd love to see swatches/hear your review once you get them :D And if you have any other questions feel free to PM me at any time!"
AustralianMakeup,3d8fp3,gospursgo_,2,Sat Jul 18 12:55:20 2015 UTC,"love it, it looks so good on you! the purple reflects are so pretty  reds/burgundies are underrated, some days i just want to bathe in mac's Cranberry"
AustralianMakeup,3d8nqy,Pandibabi,3,Tue Jul 14 10:52:10 2015 UTC,"I've had eyelash extensions a few times and found them a bit addicting because they looked so good.   Having said that, they're a bit annoying (you can't rub your eyes and you have to be careful what products you get on them) and I'm pretty sure they weakened my natural lashes temporarily. So I'd definitely get them again for special occasions but not for everyday."
AustralianMakeup,3d8nqy,skunkybooms,3,Tue Jul 14 11:27:30 2015 UTC,"Eyelash tinting (colouring) makes a pretty big difference, especially if you have fair lashes. Worth a shot and is great for subtlety enhancing your lashes while keeping a natural look.  I have eyelash extensions and I love them! No need for mascara so saves heaps of time in the mornings. I do find that they ruin my own lashes but I don't mind because I don't let them all come out, I just get them refilled so I'm never without extensions. Wouldn't recommend if you only want to get them once or twice, don't think it'd be worth the damage to your own lashes."
AustralianMakeup,3d8nqy,nahyakidding,3,Tue Jul 14 12:03:45 2015 UTC,Eyelash extensions look amazing and it feels great to wake up and already have bitchin' lashes. They also last a while if you take care of them properly however caring for them wasn't worth the effort for me - as well as this I had to cut out oil cleansing from my routine since oil breaks down the bond of the glue. Like the others have mentioned they would be great for an occasion but probably not general wear.
AustralianMakeup,3d8nqy,continuousline,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:36:46 2015 UTC,Have you looked into 'lash lifts'? I don't know if they're harmful to lashes in the long run but I was thinking about getting it done: http://www.amyjean.com.au/services/lash-lift
AustralianMakeup,3d8nqy,gospursgo_,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:10:45 2015 UTC,"Natural blonde here, eyelash tinting is amazing and cheap. Feels good to be able to see your own natural lashes haha. I've tried the lengthening fibres but they got messy during the day, and fell into my under eye creases. Not a good look."
AustralianMakeup,3d8nqy,dragoniite,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:55:58 2015 UTC,Have you tried using a lash serum to help your lashes grow/thicken? pretty sure they sell one in Mecca cosmetica
AustralianMakeup,3d869m,SnooSnooCookie,3,Tue Jul 14 06:59:51 2015 UTC,"I have quite dry skin (except my nose). I use Australis primer, then translucent setting powder, then Revlon Nearly Naked liquid, then sometimes the setting powder again or sometimes I just buff the foundation smooth with the powder brush without adding more powder.   Now, it's not perfect because sometimes the foundation and primer separate, and it's all gonna slip off in a second if I sweat (I hate summer). But for the most part it sticks to my desert face aaaaalll day."
AustralianMakeup,3d869m,rainbowplethora,2,Tue Jul 14 14:13:23 2015 UTC,What have you been using so far? Maybe it's to do with the current line-up of products you're using..?  I have dry-sensitive skin and I've been keeping my skin super hydrated and make sure my face is moisturised thoroughly before I apply my primer and makeup and setting spray.
AustralianMakeup,3d869m,pondicus,2,Tue Jul 14 07:21:10 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I know its not to do with the products I use, they've already been thoroughly scrutinized. I find if I put moisturizer on before my makeup it ends up looking like disgusting face paint. I moisturise at night and that's still toeing the line! I think my skin quite dislikes me"
AustralianMakeup,3d869m,pondicus,3,Tue Jul 14 07:44:48 2015 UTC,"Hmmm that's really interesting. It might be you're missing a primer in any case. I used to have issues with makeup staying on, but a primer helped to prolong the wear.  If you're confident that it's not the products you're using, then maybe a primer might help. If it doesn't, I'm not sure what else I can suggest."
AustralianMakeup,3d869m,DasGretchen,0,Tue Jul 14 08:08:06 2015 UTC,"Ohh I thought you meant it to be the products that are drying my skin. No I know what what I've got isn't long wearing, and I do want to incorporate/change the products I use to make everything last."
AustralianMakeup,3d869m,lampluvsu2,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:12:00 2015 UTC,Maybe try using a lighter moisturiser before putting on your makeup?
AustralianMakeup,3d869m,WarlockPanda,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:46:27 2015 UTC,I own quite a few and it's the lightest one I own. Leaves a touch of a greasy finish which is the main problem
AustralianMakeup,3d869m,pondicus,2,Fri Jul 17 11:56:39 2015 UTC,Moisture moisture moisture! Plus I also just bought Mecca's own brand primer and I love it! Similar to hourglass veil but somewhat creamier and I feel like it settles in to my skin instead of floating on top. Plus it's less than half the price of hourglass! That combined with the powder before foundation method and im sure you'd be golden all day!
AustralianMakeup,3d869m,kittenwhisker,-2,Tue Jul 14 07:30:36 2015 UTC,Are you outside of QLD? I've never heard anyone here speak of a Mecca.
AustralianMakeup,3d869m,lampluvsu2,7,Tue Jul 14 07:41:41 2015 UTC,"I'm not OP, but here is the Mecca store locator. Mecca has 3 kinds of stores  Mecca Cosmetica - more mid to high end products. Strong focus on skin care. They carry brands like By Terry and NARS  Mecca Maxima - Mecca Cosmetica's little sister who I think is more ""fun"". Stocks brands like Too Faced and Urban Decay  Kit- Similar to Mecca Maxima, but smaller and usually found inside Myer.  If you click on a product and you want to know which store stocks it, if you go down below the picture you should see a list of the stores that the product is available at. For example this TF palette is available at Kit and Mecca Maxima.  I hope that helps."
AustralianMakeup,3d869m,lampluvsu2,3,Tue Jul 14 07:57:17 2015 UTC,"That's super helpful, thanks."
AustralianMakeup,3d869m,lampluvsu2,3,Tue Jul 14 08:03:26 2015 UTC,"If you can find a Mecca, definitely go in and get some samples. Their online delivery service is also top notch if you end up liking what you've sampled and end up buying a full-size."
AustralianMakeup,3d869m,ladyhellcat,2,Tue Jul 14 08:06:53 2015 UTC,"Seconding Mecca, in my experience they're fantastic and always willing to help you find products to accommodate your skin concerns. They'll happily pot you samples, and I've never felt pressured to buy something.  OP have you tried the Nivea creme moisturiser (blue tub)? I have combo skin with dry/flaky patches and apply a thin layer, let it sit for 5 mins, then apply primer and foundation. Makes a huge difference for me."
AustralianMakeup,3d869m,fuzzboo,2,Tue Jul 14 08:24:08 2015 UTC,I'm in Perth. Don't they have Mecca in qld?? I'm not originally from here so finding new products in oz has been interesting.

AustralianMakeup,3d6mad,Jessijames,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:51:02 2015 UTC,I'd be very interested in ordering a few Blackbird shadows! Have you tried their powders at all?
AustralianMakeup,3d6mad,twoandtwenty,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:42:33 2015 UTC,I love their violet colour correcting powder. Happy to answer any specific questions if you have them!
AustralianMakeup,3d6mad,starward-,2,Tue Jul 14 02:58:14 2015 UTC,Violet is the powder I'm most interested in! Do you use it underneath foundation or as a setting powder? Do you find it actually helps with dullness? Thank you!
AustralianMakeup,3d6mad,twoandtwenty,2,Tue Jul 14 03:03:43 2015 UTC,"I have used it both ways. Personally I have found it helps with dullness. My sister actually noticed the different after I put some on her so that kinda reassured me it wasn't just me! It is a subtle effect though, but I quite like it and I've found it to be pretty good with oil control too however my skin has been somewhat less oily of late!"
AustralianMakeup,3d6mad,starward-,2,Tue Jul 14 05:21:50 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this, I'll definitely have to try at least a sample!"
AustralianMakeup,3d6mad,twoandtwenty,2,Tue Jul 14 11:28:11 2015 UTC,"I find their clear powder is really good too. Pretty excellent at blurring and setting your face. Oil control is just okay, nothing to write home about. It's pretty well-priced for what you get, especially with the abysmal exchange rate."
AustralianMakeup,3d6mad,pondicus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:59:08 2015 UTC,"Thank you, maybe I'll need to try all the powders!"

AustralianMakeup,3d6mad,SchultzAL,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:37:37 2015 UTC,I have a bunch of their samples and man they've got some stunning colours. I want the whole range in pressed pans but it would hit me at like $200 AUD -.-
AustralianMakeup,3d6mad,SchultzAL,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:45:18 2015 UTC,"I'm really loving the reddish colours, and I would love to have some nice, smooth mattes. That is one thing I have yet to find here in Aus, at a reasonable price point. I was ready to splurge on that Lorac Mega Pro, but it sold out so fast, and now I'm concerned that if I tried to buy it on eBay or similar, I'd get a fake.   And boo to this exchange rate!"
AustralianMakeup,3d6mad,SchultzAL,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:51:00 2015 UTC,"Boo to the exchange rate!! Haha  Yes, they're very smooth compared to a lot of the matte shadows I already own. I am tempted to splurge for the Kat Von D Shade & Light eye palette or the new Lorac Pro Matte but without swatching I don't know what they're like in comparison to these from Blackbird. I love that Blackbird has a lot of really cool toned shades as well, I find a lot of 'neutrals' lean warm/orange on me which is frustrating! I am wearing all Blackbird on my eyes today, I'll have to snap a picture!"
AustralianMakeup,3d6mad,pondicus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:57:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, please post a picture, I'd love to see them on someone with the same skin tone as me. :)  For the price of the Blackbird samples, I feel like I can't go wrong.  I also wanted to add that I use one of these to store sample sized loose powders. Works great and I stick or write the names of the powders on the top if need be."

AustralianMakeup,3d3fmf,starward-,2,Mon Jul 13 05:34:56 2015 UTC,"I think it said ""Offer ends 26/07/15"" but I can't be too sure!   Edit: It indeed is till 26th of July, just checked."
AustralianMakeup,3d3tnv,starward-,8,Mon Jul 13 08:22:33 2015 UTC,I have the powder brush and it's TERRIBLE. It felt like the scratchy bristles were attacking my face. Do not buy it. I hate hate hate it. I even bought a second one when I found it in a clearance bin just to make sure I hadn't picked up a dud the first shot and it was just as bad.
AustralianMakeup,3d3tnv,ailee612,2,Mon Jul 13 10:04:23 2015 UTC,Agreed. I used it a total of ONCE and decided it would be better put to use as a painting tool.
AustralianMakeup,3d3tnv,toasty_feet,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:18:31 2015 UTC,Thank you for the heads up! Seems like the eye brushes are the only good things out of the range.
AustralianMakeup,3d3tnv,starwish216,2,Mon Jul 13 10:50:43 2015 UTC,"Oh my god, yes, stay away from the powder brush. It's just a nightmare to use, it's like tiny claws D:  Not worth the trouble at all."

AustralianMakeup,3d3tnv,pondicus,4,Mon Jul 13 14:18:40 2015 UTC,"I still have the kabuki stippler brush from them after picking them up at a sale. Shedding central of Shedtown. Shit son. Washing it was a pain, and brushing it across my face would leave straggler bristles on my cheek.   Actually, I don't know why I haven't thrown it out yet. I should do that."
AustralianMakeup,3d3tnv,sydneysomething,7,Mon Jul 13 11:12:03 2015 UTC,"Maybe you could use it to rub shaving cream on your legs like a fancy old-timey barber shop? (I just hate throwing things away, okay?)"
AustralianMakeup,3d3tnv,WarlockPanda,2,Mon Jul 13 11:14:51 2015 UTC,I shall try that when Winter Stops Coming!
AustralianMakeup,3d3tnv,pootlepower,3,Mon Jul 13 11:18:22 2015 UTC,Haha I tell everyone I need my leg fur for warmth but really winter is just a good excuse for my laziness.
AustralianMakeup,3d3tnv,WarlockPanda,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:22:28 2015 UTC,Hahahahahaha this is the best suggestion ever.
AustralianMakeup,3d3tnv,pootlepower,7,Tue Jul 14 06:30:55 2015 UTC,"Not brushes, but I bought one of their sharpeners a long long time ago and I loved it because you could get a nice sharp point on the pencil so you could do a wing. However, I had to replace it because it was not sharpening so well after it's 5 years of service> I've found that my new one will not sharpen to a point. It keeps making the tip dull. I then forked out about $15 for UD grindhouse, which has the exact same problem as my new manicare one grumbles :("
AustralianMakeup,3d3tnv,WarlockPanda,6,Mon Jul 13 08:50:06 2015 UTC,"Check out the Essence ones, mine gets a nice sharp point and they're so cheap you can toss it guilt-free if you don't like it."
AustralianMakeup,3d3tnv,Twerkle-Belle,5,Mon Jul 13 12:09:08 2015 UTC,You are wonderful! I bought the essence one today and it sharpens like a dream and gives the perfect point on my eyeliners. I feel so bad wasting so much money on other cosmetic sharpeners now.
AustralianMakeup,3d3tnv,rowha,2,Wed Jul 15 08:56:03 2015 UTC,Never underestimate Essence. Unsung heroes.
AustralianMakeup,3d3tnv,jamballdonut,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:26:32 2015 UTC,I will. I was thinking about it the other day. I just don't want to be disappointed again.
AustralianMakeup,3d3tnv,rowha,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:32:44 2015 UTC,I have a cheap elf one from Kmart and I really love it! It was like $3 and my pencils come out super sharp :D
AustralianMakeup,3d3tnv,gospursgo_,2,Mon Jul 13 22:10:16 2015 UTC,Man that sucks. 5 years for the original though is pretty damn impressive.
AustralianMakeup,3d3tnv,SizzlingVivacity,3,Mon Jul 13 10:04:29 2015 UTC,I had an angled blush brush (Artiste range) and it used to shed SO much. Ended up giving it away.
AustralianMakeup,3d3tnv,gospursgo_,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:38:48 2015 UTC,"Is Artiste and Manicare the same thing? Honestly I didn't check since they were only 20 not 50% off. If so, I may have to avoid. Thanks!"
AustralianMakeup,3d3tnv,SizzlingVivacity,3,Mon Jul 13 10:02:45 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure Artiste is owned by Manicare, and it's like ""Artiste by Manicare"" (Similar to Savvy, who are owned by DB, so it's ""Savvy by DB"").  I don't really like Artiste, I've played with a few of their brushes instore, but they've never been worth it, imo"
AustralianMakeup,3d3tnv,disorderedmind,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:47:06 2015 UTC,"TIL, thank you!"
AustralianMakeup,3d3tnv,SizzlingVivacity,2,Mon Jul 13 10:50:09 2015 UTC,"jamballdonut kindly answered your question, but I will say I also have an angled eyeliner brush and a sponge tip blending brush from Manicare which I do reach for often. I use the eyeliner brush for my brows, cos it's too thick for my eyes but not too thick that it would pick up too much product for my brows. Had it for years and no fallout and minimal change of shape so that's good. And the sponge tip brush, you can't really go wrong with any brand of those IMO."
AustralianMakeup,3d3tnv,gospursgo_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:10:35 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thank you! :)"

AustralianMakeup,3d3tnv,jamballdonut,3,Mon Jul 13 09:18:03 2015 UTC,That's so weird.. I have the sponge and I like how firm it is...

AustralianMakeup,3d3tnv,SnooSnooCookie,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:15:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah I have the chi chi one as well.. I think my makeup actually comes up nicer with my manicare one, but I use a pretty firm bouncing motion that would probably flatten the chi chi one. I find the chi chi one soaks up a lot of my foundation as well and I waste a fair bit when I use it"
AustralianMakeup,3d3tnv,neodeone,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:21:54 2015 UTC,Me too. I have the Chi Chi and Real Techniques ones too but I prefer the Manicare.
AustralianMakeup,3d2vka,jamballdonut,9,Mon Jul 13 02:17:43 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I prefer Target’s ""30% off"" than Priceline’s silly “3 for 2” sales. I always overbuy with Priceline to get the deal, but then end up with products that I’m not loving."
AustralianMakeup,3d2vka,jknee88,3,Mon Jul 13 05:50:59 2015 UTC,"& it generally works out more expensive anyway! I don't think I've ever bought anything in a 3 for 2 sale.  I just wait for a % sale, wherever it is"

AustralianMakeup,3d2vka,spooknat,5,Mon Jul 13 04:37:56 2015 UTC,Is NYX included in the sale? (Usually they are but can't see them in your picture)
AustralianMakeup,3d2vka,spooknat,2,Mon Jul 13 07:35:23 2015 UTC,"Nope, not this time! They generally do it every second one, and NYX was included last time."

AustralianMakeup,3d2vka,spooknat,2,Mon Jul 13 11:38:05 2015 UTC,Never can find decent nyx stuff anyways. I think i grabbed a used nyx soft matte lipstick last time and paid full price :(
AustralianMakeup,3d2vka,flowerbobon,2,Mon Jul 13 17:20:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know what you mean - the stand is usually in a state of disarray, and most of the lip creams especially look like they've been played with. I would love if they taped down their products! This happens with all the drugstore brand though - the other day at Priceline I wanted satin mauve lip pencil from Essence, there were 4 left and despite there being some sticky tape and I decided to pop them open and look and what do you know, they were all smushy and tested :("
AustralianMakeup,3d2vka,Dtapped,3,Tue Jul 14 07:19:46 2015 UTC,yeay Chichi is 30% off!! I already have my wishlist I am prepared my for this.

AustralianMakeup,3d2vka,gospursgo_,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:28:03 2015 UTC,My thoughts exactly. Anyone tried that Maybelline lash sensational mascara? I'm intrigued…
AustralianMakeup,3d2vka,mononooke,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:05:48 2015 UTC,I haven't tried it but I've heard that it's great! I'll definitely be picking one up for 30% off! Hopefully Priceline will counter with some good sales because I have one near my work haha
AustralianMakeup,3d2vka,gospursgo_,3,Mon Jul 13 03:43:03 2015 UTC,"i was really disappointed with priceline for the 50% rimmel sale, most stores were out of stock of a few things BEFORE the sale started and they didnt restock, and during the sale when anything went out of stock, no one bothered to re order (until i'd specifically asked one lady)  edit: so my point is (lol) i hope priceline has stock should they decide to counter :P"
AustralianMakeup,3d2vka,mononooke,2,Mon Jul 13 03:57:19 2015 UTC,That's true! I was lucky to get what I got when I went in (one day into the sale) I just went back and the girl tried a rimmel foundation on me but it was out of stock *shakes fist! Damn you haha. She said I should buy it online -.-   I still hope they counter tho!
AustralianMakeup,3d2vka,sleeppenguin,2,Mon Jul 13 04:08:43 2015 UTC,"i like rimmel foundations! your other option is to price match with bigw or chemist warehouse, but my local chemist warehouse are rude and hate price matching like im taking the money out of their own pockets haha -_-  phew, glad to have that off my chest"
AustralianMakeup,3d2vka,mononooke,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:22:47 2015 UTC,Good idea! Haha luckily the people at my local chemist warehouse aren't too bad!
AustralianMakeup,3d2vka,Jessijames,2,Mon Jul 13 08:19:19 2015 UTC,Just a heads up Chemist Warehouse has it for I think 11.95 which will probably work out cheaper as I think it retails for around 20:)
AustralianMakeup,3d2vka,myhiddentreasureches,2,Mon Jul 13 04:58:03 2015 UTC,Oh nice thanks! It's currently 8 at Priceline but I don't think I'll be able to get it in time and there's a chemist warehouse near my house! Thanks :)

AustralianMakeup,3d2ocj,bitch_is_cray_cray,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:30:45 2015 UTC,That was for me to buy it be myself. It was like 19.50 for shipping. So it was like $36 to get 20 masks. Also the shipping is based on weight.
AustralianMakeup,3d2ocj,bitch_is_cray_cray,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:03:29 2015 UTC,Just wondering if you are interested in the second option (splitting the 22.45 between the buyers)?

AustralianMakeup,3czvtg,WarlockPanda,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:39:44 2015 UTC,"They have sooooo many different types of lashes, I'm keen to get a bunch of them! Have you tried their lash glue with it?"
AustralianMakeup,3czvtg,WarlockPanda,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:25:56 2015 UTC,Yes. It's not my favourite as I find it doesn't easily come off but it is great if you want to practice application and don't mind the extra time it takes to remove it.
AustralianMakeup,3czvtg,kdarmy,7,Mon Jul 13 05:27:47 2015 UTC,"The Puff & Sponge Cleaner is hands down the best brush cleanser I've ever used, and so incredibly cheap to boot!"
AustralianMakeup,3czvtg,Flippantry,5,Sun Jul 12 09:38:15 2015 UTC,"Best   Blushes - I'm always raving about the Daiso blushes (this kind) amazing pigmentation, soft and easy to blend in my opinion.  Eyelashes - this range in particular are excellent Brush and Sponge cleaner - we all know why this is amazing   Meh   Collagen Sleeping Pack - didn't really do much BB Sheet Mask - pretty average sheet mask, I guess it's not all bad since it's $2.80 for 2.    Worst   Co-Enzyme Q10 Sheet Mask - this probably won't be bad for everyone but it made my skin super angry, I've never had such a bad reaction to a sheet mask before and had to take it off right away!"
AustralianMakeup,3czvtg,starward-,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:38:46 2015 UTC,I actually found the Q10 moisturising! It didn't do a great job but I am glad it didn't freak my skin out.
AustralianMakeup,3czvtg,sleuthycake,3,Mon Jul 13 11:18:28 2015 UTC,"I find the Daiso Makeup Corrector (makeup remover pen) to be quite a useful. Though honestly its just basically like vaseline in a stick form, but it's pretty handy!   It's good to keep in your handbag for touchups or to just get rid of makeup smudges."
AustralianMakeup,3czvtg,Rocha_999,3,Sun Jul 12 15:06:13 2015 UTC,Yep I've used falsies from there and they were decent enough. Wasn't game to try the glue though.
AustralianMakeup,3czvtg,IrmaGehrd,3,Sun Jul 12 10:00:45 2015 UTC,"Their eyebrow sealer is great too, but hardly ever in stock."
AustralianMakeup,3czvtg,berlin_chair_,2,Sun Jul 12 12:01:06 2015 UTC,Yes - the stuff that looks like a clear nail polish but is just a very light brow 'glue'? I love it - if you're in Brisbane City there's a place called Japan Danda - which is like an indie version of Daiso and has a few similar/same cosmetics.
AustralianMakeup,3czvtg,IrmaGehrd,2,Mon Jul 13 01:42:33 2015 UTC,"Yep, that stuff! It seals everything in place all day. I can go out, do a full day of work then play soccer for an hour and still have my eyebrows be on point. It's amazing."

AustralianMakeup,3czvtg,damn-croissants,3,Thu Jul 16 08:47:01 2015 UTC,I really like the eyeliner which comes in a pot with a brush.  Their micellar water/cleansing water is awful! It has a tonne of alcohol in it and doesn't work at all
AustralianMakeup,3czvtg,lipstickhodor,2,Sun Jul 12 13:59:43 2015 UTC,Maybe you could repurpose it into a quick/spot brush cleaner?

AustralianMakeup,3czvtg,finalvaledictory,3,Tue Jul 14 07:24:01 2015 UTC,"I actually quite like the BB face masks. They come in a two-pack and you have the choice of with hyaluronic acid or collagen (red). I usually go for the hyaluronic pack, as I find the collagen one has a rose scent which can be a bit too strong.   Not so sure about the charcoal mask and nose packs. Whilst they do their job fairly well, they leave your skin pretty dry; I probably wouldn't recommend.  The brow pencils are pretty decent."
AustralianMakeup,3czvtg,Pandarmonium,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:29:04 2015 UTC,"Seconding the Hyaluronic BB Face Masks!  They are sooo super moistourising and leave my skin feeling hydrated, fresh and plump. I've also found them to reduce redness (i.e any redness on my face is reduced once I take the mask off compared to before the mask - not sure about long term redness reduction).  The instructions say to only leave on for like 10 minutes, but the masks are so soping wet full of product I'll normally leave it on for upwards of an hour, take the mask off, squeeze the remaining product out of the mask and then massage the product into my face and let sit."
AustralianMakeup,3czvtg,NocturnalNightingale,2,Thu Jul 16 07:47:34 2015 UTC,Their brow pencils and powders are pretty good for the price.
AustralianMakeup,3czvtg,pyjamasquid,3,Sun Jul 12 11:03:23 2015 UTC,"Seconding this! I love that they do grey shades, too - so much better for people with cool-toned brown/black hair than brown."
AustralianMakeup,3czvtg,WarlockPanda,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:43:25 2015 UTC,I've been struggling to find a grey one in Daiso for ages. :(
AustralianMakeup,3czvtg,pyjamasquid,2,Mon Jul 13 05:29:28 2015 UTC,I found a grey one in their Chatswood store (Mandarin Centre) the other day!
AustralianMakeup,3czvtg,WarlockPanda,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:19:39 2015 UTC,That sucks :( Whereabouts are you? I'm in Melbourne and at least two of the CBD stores here normally have a few in stock. Unfortunately not every style of pencil has a grey (they have a really thin one I'd love to try otherwise) but there's always at least a couple.
AustralianMakeup,3czvtg,pyjamasquid,2,Tue Jul 14 04:04:50 2015 UTC,Brisbane. I've tried the CBD store and the Chermside store and I can only seem to find brown eyebrow pencils.
AustralianMakeup,3czvtg,WarlockPanda,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:58:08 2015 UTC,"Aww :( I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with Brisbane or the Daisos there to help! It does seem to vary between stores as to what they have; this is the grey one I can normally find - I know that picture says brown but it definitely comes in grey. Do you guys have a Face Shop in Brisbane? I haven't tried it personally, but I know they do a an eyebrow pencil in grey. I have no idea what the pricing is (more expensive than Daiso at least, I'd guess) but it shouldn't be any higher than drugstore."
AustralianMakeup,3czvtg,NocturnalNightingale,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:51:37 2015 UTC,"YES! I was using that exact one from Daiso, but they don't seem to have it in stock every time I check. It's been almost a year since I finished mine. It was by far my favorite brow product. I'll check out the Face Shop one. We have W cosmetics in the Myer Centre which stocks TFS, so they might have it."
AustralianMakeup,3czvtg,starward-,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:59:10 2015 UTC,Is it any brow pencil or powder in particular that's good? They have so many - I was trying to look for a brow pencil today but I couldn't decide ಠ_ಠ
AustralianMakeup,3czvtg,Sandpaper_Kiss,2,Sun Jul 12 11:42:06 2015 UTC,"The powder in the little white container is good, it has two shades and comes with a brush. I don't have the eye pencil anymore, but it had a pencil on one end and a little brow brush on the other end."
AustralianMakeup,3czvtg,starward-,2,Sun Jul 12 12:33:49 2015 UTC,"Love love love the silicone mask. The sponge/brush cleaner is also great and as everyone has said their lashes are also good.  Eyeshadow - I'm sorry I can't remember the name of what I bought but it may have been the same thing as I remember pearl being in there. Anyway I found them to be quite chalky and unpigmented, basically not worth it.   Face masks - I find they're okay as a moisturising product but now I've tried other brands I probably wouldn't repurchase  (Maybe kinda gross?) Foot masks - wouldn't bother. I was kinda excited for the peeling foot thing to happen. The foot mask didn't do anything though. I tried it twice, didn't have any noticeable effects"
AustralianMakeup,3czvtg,DarkHatexx,2,Sun Jul 12 14:20:31 2015 UTC,Puff and sponge cleaner: It's so gross looking at how much makeup comes out when you use this stuff but so satisfying.  False lashes with the invisible bands: I have never had more comfortable eyelashes- I work in construction and I still feel comfortable wearing these to work.

AustralianMakeup,3czvtg,jaded_elf,2,Mon Jul 13 11:18:47 2015 UTC,Loves:   Puff and Sponge Cleanser -  For cleaning my Real Technique Sponge and Chi Chi Sponge.  Makeup storage - There are some awesome cup holders and makeup organisers there and only for $2.80   Not so loves:   I did try the long and curl lash. The results weren't really amazing. But I have really stubborn Asian lashes :( On the fence with the black charcoal mask as it aggravate and makes the pores bigger. But does deal with blackheads so I don't know. It isn't a permanent solution so I might stop using it
AustralianMakeup,3czvtg,DarkHatexx,3,Sun Jul 12 08:42:52 2015 UTC,The only sad thing is that the Puff cleanser is rarely in stock! I was told by the sales assistant that they're gone within days of being in stock. (Chatswood and Macquarie in Sydney don't have it in stock at the moment!)

AustralianMakeup,3cztz5,badassbettie,2,Sun Jul 12 08:05:17 2015 UTC,"I have! It did crease a bit. Most things do on me though, I just don't apply it too close to the lower lash line and do a final wipe away before powdering my face"
AustralianMakeup,3cztz5,jknee88,2,Sun Jul 12 08:36:48 2015 UTC,"It doesn't crease for me...although i do kind of work it into the skin when I apply. It's quite a solid cream, so I warm it up a bit with my fingertips to get a smooth consistency.  I find it's not the best coverage, but it was a great price point until i can justify spending $$$ for the Tarte undereye corrector!

AustralianMakeup,3cztz5,pondicus,2,Sun Jul 12 08:28:48 2015 UTC,"If you're willing to wait, you can get the Asian Beauty brand, Skinfood Peach Salmon Undereye Concealer for a good price - comes in 2 shades of peach. Lots of reviews on Google too."
AustralianMakeup,3cztz5,mackinnon_13,2,Sun Jul 12 13:07:55 2015 UTC,"I make my own using orange lipstick and concealer. My go-to is MAC Morange and I seriously use the littlest dab mixed with concealer. I rub my fingertip across the top of the bullet once and that's enough to correct the inner corners of my eyes (either side of the bridge of my nose) which are bright blue due to veins and thin skin. Sometimes I buff the lipstick straight into the skin and top with concealer, sometimes I mix it into concealer. Choose something with minimal/no fragrance and a cream texture/finish- not glossy or matte. Revlon no doubt have something suitable."
AustralianMakeup,3cztz5,asteroyale,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:26:04 2015 UTC,"These aren't drugstore but you said you would consider higher options so here's a few. If you're near a Sephora they have the Tarte Colored Clay CC Undereye Corrector which comes in 2 shades, the darker is more orange. I've also heard great things about the Bobbi Brown Correctors (this is really expensive though)."
AustralianMakeup,3cztz5,sleuthycake,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:26:23 2015 UTC,"Though not necessarily a correcting concealer, the NYX Eyeshadow Base in Skin tone has a bit of a peachy tone and I found it to work pretty decently in covering up my dark circles.    Although looking at the prices of it in Target, it's a few dollars more than the other NYX concealer products, so probably better to give the other ones a go than the eyeshadow base.   I only decided to try it out as I already had the product in my collection haha!"
AustralianMakeup,3cztz5,vulpixies,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:53:07 2015 UTC,"I started off using the NYX dark circle concealer and it was such a good starting point for me even though it does crease a fair bit.

If you can spare the money (it is quite expensive) definitely check it out, however NYX is a great starting point if not."

Go to mecca, get matched and ask for a sample so you can try it at home!"
AustralianMakeup,3czbs0,tofu-queen,3,Sun Jul 12 03:46:43 2015 UTC,"Word of warning, I have tried both the US formula and the Aus/Euro version and in my opinion they are vastly different foundations. The US version in the small bottle is much thinner in consistency and coverage and barely lasted a few hours on me but the Au version in stores here is much better to work with, coverage is much better and lasts much longer for me. It's just a pain that they don't carry the lightest shades here like they do in the UK - I am going to look at buying mine from the UK soon but you can also get it from Luxola in the lighter UK shades as well!"

AustralianMakeup,3cwohz,starward-,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:27:13 2015 UTC,"Okay, so I'm a total smokey eye newbie. I have long avoided black shadows because let's be real, they scare the shit out of me. I'm home bored on a Saturday night, thought I'd give a dark eye look a whirl, so I am most definitely after some CCW for the eye look! I am not sold on the blue I put in the waterline, I didn't want to do black liner there because I was worried it would drag down the look but looking back I think it would work better!  Fair warning, I am without foundation just some light powder and a spot of concealer - and my brows need to be tidied like crasy. Reference photo for the shadows  Product list:   Too Faced Shadow Insurance as a base all over 352 all over the browbone and lightly on the crease (matte pale peach/pink identical to my skintone really) Using the Inglot 107 R trio, I gently buffed each shade into the crease from lightest to darkest, concerntrating it a little more precise with each darker shade Patted 31 onto the inner corner lightly  Using a flat brush, I packed the Essence shadow (11 - Wild at Heart) all over the lid stopping juuuuuust under the crease line. This took some packing let me tell you, these shadows are really lovely colours but are only moderately pigmented. Then I grabbed a bit of the Inglot 426 and patted it into the centre of the lid to give a touch of dimension. Taking the Inglot shadow 342 which is a cool-toned mid brown I used this to start buffing the navy up into the crease being careful to not bring it up above the crease. Repeated until it looked nicely buffed out to me (2 more times of dipping into the shadow I think) Taking the black matte Inglot 63 on a much smaller blending brush I worked it bit by bit into the outer crease and V but I was scared to go overboard - again looking back, I could easily have really built this up more though. But this point, the blue closer to the crease had faded a bit from all the buffing so I took the nave Essence & the blue Inglot and re-patted it on carefully to 'top it back up' Re-applied Inglot 31 into the inner corner and took it halfway across the lower lash line. Grabbed the 342 on a larger pencil brush and buffed it across the rest of the lower lashline, connecting it to the upper-outer V followed by a little of the Inglot blue 426 on a smaller pencil brush very finely on the lower lash line for a nice pop. Used a Chi Chi 'All Night Long' pencil liner in Black for the upper waterline, Maybelline Master Precise felt liner to map out the wing and filled/topped it with MAC Fluidline in Blacktrack. The blue pencil in the lower waterline is Rimmel Scandaleyes in 014 Bright Blue. Too Faced Better Than Sex mascara but my tube is on it's last legs and becoming clumpy >.< Brows lightly filled in with MAC brow pencil in Spiked"
AustralianMakeup,3cwohz,ailurosly,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:36:09 2015 UTC,"So I'm a bit late to this thread but I really like this look. The only suggestion I would have (and someone has already mentioned I think so feel free to ignore me) is to have the eyeshadow going a bit higher up, so just past your crease/where it ends now. I think it would help with the smokey feel."
AustralianMakeup,3cwohz,insiped,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:16:18 2015 UTC,"The blue on the waterline is a really nice touch! I think a stronger inner-corner highlight would look pretty good-- maybe a silver or a gold, depending on your preferences."

AustralianMakeup,3cwohz,pootlepower,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:51:30 2015 UTC,I love the combination of the blue with the brown! Browns and neutrals help tone down the look so it's not too over the top. Like /u/ailurosly said the blue on the waterline is a nice touch but there definitely needs to be inner corner. Highlighting the middle of the lid with maybe a lighter blue would help open up the eyes too. Otherwise its a good look on you :)
AustralianMakeup,3cwohz,MsOrangeCake,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:01:04 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Definitely agree about having a stronger inner Courtney highlight. The shade I put there was only lightly and it doesn't translate well on camera.

I've spent the past 3 weeks with a cold/sniffles/throat thing, so please ignore how bad my skin/chin looks, I can't heeeeelp it.  CCW, of course! but plz don't be too mean, it's been 3 weeks since I've put makeup on so I was a little out of the game and my skin was hating me :D   Simple Lightweight Hydrating Moisturiser - I used to LOVE this, but it's stopped working so well, so it doesn't hydrate my skin anymore Nivea Post Shave Balm - I really enjoy this, but because my skin is so dry it hasn't been doing the most lately.  It definitely helped my moisturiser though! Hourglass Mineral Veil Primer - Bought this for my birthday last month.  I expected it to be a gel consistency (Like the Post Shave Balm), but it's actually a cream, which was interesting! It seemed a little hard to apply, but I think next time I'll skip one of those ^ two, and use this instead.  It was nice, but my nose needs soo much hydration, I swear. BYS Liquid Illuminator in Strobe - Heard this was a dupe for MAC Strobe Cream, which is way too expensive for me, so I picked it up and REALLY enjoyed it.  It gave me such a nice, subtle glow from within, and because it's a cream underneath my foundation I didn't get a cakey/powdery look that I do with a powder highlighter.  Definitely recommend! Revlon Nearly Naked Foundation in Ivory Rimmel Wake Me Up Concealer in Ivory Maybelline Fit Me Concealer in 15 Fair - My favourite ever <3 Rimmel Stay Matte Powder Urban Decay Naked Flushed Palette in bronzer & blush Essence Metal Glam Highlighter in Gold Digger Savvy Brow Kit in Light/Medium - I know this doesn't match, but it was the only brow product I had on me, and I'm trying to use up the wax, don't judge L'Oreal Brow Artist Plumper in Transparent - Still not sure how I feel about this.  It kind of feels like the product doesn't actually move from the brush to my brows, but I dunno, gotta play around with it a bit more Urban Decay Eyeshadow Primer Potion LORAC Pro palette in Cream, Mauve, Sable, Espresso - My favourite palette ever Inglot shadows in 09 (inner corner, gold) and 607 (to set MAC Fluidline & bottom lash line) MAC Fluidline in Looking Good - First time using this properly, and I had to use 3 layers to actually get decent pigmentation, THEN set it with an Inglot shadow (607).  Think I'll have to play with it a bit more, but I'm so far a little disappointed with it. Rimmel WonderFull Mascara (The original, gold tube) - LOVE this mascara.  Only did one coat, and it's just great Rimmel Scandeleyes in Nude Essence Lip Liner in Cute Pink Urban Decay Revolution Lip Gloss in Failbait - I only applied a thin coat of this, but I actually really enjoyed it.  It also has a nice, subtle scent that's not overpowering and doesn't smell gross.  Definitely going to pick up more, once I've gotten through some more glosses in my collection   & that's everything! I'm also wearing a fake septum ring that I got for $2 off eBay that I love, but glad I bought fake ones because I don't think it suits me haha"

To be honest it just solidifies my loyalty to Mecca.

It will make it harder for them enter into the market in other states."

AustralianMakeup,3cum6b,underelectriclight,23,Tue Jul 14 12:36:23 2015 UTC,"They should focus on fixing their limited stock in the first Sydney store.

Side note: I'm from Melbourne, I have visited twice- haven't been able to purchase anything on my long list due to nothing being in stock. The only way I get over the frustration is by laughing"
AustralianMakeup,3cum6b,hez_lea,3,Fri Jul 10 23:37:28 2015 UTC,Yeah I've heard this is a huge issue. They really gotta pull their finger out and get a better restock schedule although it's probably beyond their control and dictated by the brands themselves - I know even Mecca has its own supply issues at times.
AustralianMakeup,3cum6b,underelectriclight,4,Fri Jul 10 23:57:04 2015 UTC,Yeah absolutely! It's understandable about brands- I don't mind waiting.

I'm pretty patient with Mecca because whenever I ask they usually have a date or are more organised on the matter :)
AustralianMakeup,3cum6b,Jessijames,2,Sat Jul 11 00:18:40 2015 UTC,I wonder if this will actually be easier once they have a few stores open - their order amounts will be higher so might be more of a priority for the suppliers?

AustralianMakeup,3cum6b,sydneysomething,2,Sat Jul 11 01:03:50 2015 UTC,"That's very true about Mecca, it makes all the difference that they have info!   I think with an online sephora it would depend of their warehouse would be based here or if it would ship from their main warehouses in the US like the UK orders do. If it was out of the US then there wouldn't be any stock issues!"

AustralianMakeup,3cum6b,alix_mac,12,Sun Jul 12 10:50:54 2015 UTC,"I don't understand all of the hate this decision is getting, there's clearly more going on behind the scenes that the public doesn't know about. Retail rental in Melbourne is WAY tricker to manoeuvre than it is in Sydney, and it's likely that this was supposed to be the third store, but just ended up being the second due to delays (source: used to work at a 'fruit shop' that followed the exact same pattern in retail openings eight-ish years ago).   Also I'm sure Sephora is aware just how much money there is to be made in Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide, online, etc., so I'm sure things are in the works. It is a company after all, they don't NOT want to make money!"
AustralianMakeup,3cum6b,Shiavo,18,Fri Jul 10 22:45:28 2015 UTC,"I have to agree about this perhaps not being their original plan. I'd guess that the renovations at Chadstone here in Melbourne (where Sephora is due to open) have been delayed and won't be until early 2016 so they've sped up the opening of a 2nd Sydney store (or it was originally scheduled to open at the same time) to keep the flow going. I'm bummed about it but I don't understand why people are tearing their hair out over it haha  Edit: Down votes, really guys? It looks like some people really do have their knickers in a knot. It's a store people, not the end of the world - grow up. While I don't agree with the decision, we don't know all the facts and never will. There are far worse things going on in the world than this."
AustralianMakeup,3cum6b,mononooke,5,Fri Jul 10 23:55:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're exactly right. The Apple Store at Chadstone was supposed to open way before the one at Chatswood in NSW, in fact right after the Sydney store was opened, but there were lots of delays in the building/leasing/construction process that pushed it back. Chatswood was then pushed forward (which I bet is exactly what's happened with Macquarie and Sephora). Momentum is very important."
AustralianMakeup,3cum6b,mononooke,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:51:34 2015 UTC,"While I tend to agree with this, I think their lack of transparency is making people feel lied to and betrayed by the initial promises. I personally don't mind the delays, it's better than no Sephora's happening at all.  If Sephora wanted to put out a PSA on delays with Online or other locations and even a ""hopeful"" time frame, I'd feel a lot better about it than I do about wondering if their ad campaign of ""Sephora coming to Australia!!"" ..  actually had the word Australia as a typo for Sydney."
AustralianMakeup,3cum6b,cherryberry88,6,Mon Jul 13 07:42:23 2015 UTC,They said ages ago that they're going to focus on bringing more stores to Aus before online so I really don't know what you guys were expecting hey.. Ohwell :)
AustralianMakeup,3cum6b,elfies_,2,Sat Jul 11 04:45:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and everyone thought it was a stupid decision from the moment they said that."

AustralianMakeup,3cum6b,badasshobbit,2,Sat Jul 11 09:23:23 2015 UTC,"I think people are getting mad because there's so much demand for an online store, and it doesn't make much sense at all as to why they wouldn't try and answer that demand. As well as opening a second physical store while the first still has a lot of issues with products being out of stock."
AustralianMakeup,3cum6b,nerdb1rd,2,Sat Jul 11 10:07:10 2015 UTC,"I do like the fact that having a Mecca Maxima , H+M and forever 21 close by to bulk shop. But as others have said its pointless having it  * A) so far from a main CBD for commuters to stop off on the way home (parramatta or miranda might have been better choices ) * B) Without half the stock of the US stores (been lusting after the perfection mist airbrush foundation and i can't look online to see if and when they get new stock in) * C) without setting an online presence, they know its a high demand market especially for interstate travellers but also in general australia's shopping market is soley an online based one."
AustralianMakeup,3cum6b,amyeh,8,Sat Jul 11 02:13:21 2015 UTC,"macquarie is basically the same as miranda or parramatta but in the opposite direction. it's probably the most logical place to set up a new store outside of the CBD as it's got all the other highly coveted, new, international brands (H&M, Forever 21, etc). i work at the miranda centre and tbh it's really quiet there, it may have been a really exciting renovation but the customer flow is nowhere near as high as macquarie"
AustralianMakeup,3cum6b,nerdb1rd,2,Sat Jul 11 07:54:33 2015 UTC,"Hmm Macquarie was probably a choice due to the fact it had H&M, Forever 21, Mecca etc. It is always packed on the weekends and even on weekdays there are plenty of shoppers that drive out just for H&M or F21.   But I would definitley like an online store before another physical store and cbd Sephora is always out of stock for so many items. :/"

AustralianMakeup,3cuvr8,stella_rani,3,Fri Jul 10 23:40:02 2015 UTC,"I bought these!   I already have a big collection of high end brushes and bought these so I didn't have to clean them all the time because I'm lazy.   Some of the brushes are really good and some are not. You have to be careful with the glue because it can loosen. The eye brushes are decent but I don't use all of them. The face brushes have a good amount of fluff to them too.   If you're after a cheap brush set, go for this one. Just make sure you wash them thoroughly as there will be shedding for the first few applications, but after that it's fine."
AustralianMakeup,3csbma,compactgirlfriend,3,Fri Jul 10 11:08:38 2015 UTC,I really do love the blush palette. They look like a shimmer bomb but give a beautiful glow on the cheek.
AustralianMakeup,3csbma,badassbettie,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:40:51 2015 UTC,"I was rather disappointed in the blush palette, they all looked the same on my cheeks which is odd - there just wasn't enough of a difference at how they looked on my cheeks for me to justify keeping it. I do miss the deeper mauve, mood exposure is it? It's on my list to purchase as a single for sure."
AustralianMakeup,3csbma,Jessijames,2,Fri Jul 10 12:07:50 2015 UTC,Each swatch was a long swirl and 2 swipes. This is just to enhance the colour.
AustralianMakeup,3csbma,Crumpet92,2,Fri Jul 10 11:14:36 2015 UTC,"Are these your first hourglass products? I went in on the weekend and played with the eyeshadow palettes for a bit and loved them. The price is a bit scary though, what are your thoughts on the brand?"
AustralianMakeup,3csbma,RipperReeta,3,Fri Jul 10 13:18:58 2015 UTC,"Hi!  I also own the primer. The primer is amazing. It makes your skin feel so silky but you have to moisturise so thoroughly before you use it.   I agree. The price is a bit scary and I probably use these products due to how much money I dropped on them. I think it is a little overpriced for what it is and I believe Hourglass may be getting a bit too adventurous with its pricing but on the other hand, you do get what you pay for. I also believe that Hourglass charges by how pretty their packaging is and I'm a sucker for packaging.   I would recommend though, but only if you'd get a good proper use out of them. I use both palettes everyday but the bronzers, not so much because I have so many bronzers.   I feel like it is more like an investment. If you want to really go out and buy, I'd suggest the Ambient Lighting Palette. It is the only powder I carry with me if I'm staying away from my house. I use it to set, highlight and do light contouring.   My overall impression is that Hourglass is a brand where you do pay for the name and the packaging but their products really live up to its potential."
AustralianMakeup,3csbma,Pandarmonium,2,Fri Jul 10 13:56:56 2015 UTC,May I make this suggestion - In case you haven't seen the release due Christmas this year from Hourglass - If you're going to splurge - may as well do it right! http://www.budgetbeautyblog.com/2015/07/new-hourglass-palette-coming-for.html (PS: Excuse the repost of the same comment - I felt others might appreciate the info :) )
AustralianMakeup,3csbma,RipperReeta,2,Sat Jul 11 08:53:46 2015 UTC,Yeah I saw this! It is why I made this post so people could see the colours that are in the palette :)

AustralianMakeup,3crht6,Jessijames,3,Fri Jul 10 04:41:48 2015 UTC,"Okay it could just be me but I have also found if I work fast, they combine with other lipsticks and mattify them. So they're overall less drying, but I still get the matte effect. When I say lipsticks I mean bullets (though they will all mix with each other and other liquid to matte lipsticks AFAIK)"
AustralianMakeup,3crht6,starward-,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:47:53 2015 UTC,"Oh yes! I should have added this as well, but I've only done it one or twice. You're definitely right though, it's another way to make them less drying in general and to switch up the colours! :)"

AustralianMakeup,3crht6,Telluricx,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:07:48 2015 UTC,"I've tried two VL and I didn't like either of them. Both balled in the middle of my lips and wore off within 2 hours of me wearing them. That said, both were dark colours and I ordered both online (crush cosmetics) and both arrived broken. So maybe the air getting into the product changed the formula. What do you guys think?"
AustralianMakeup,3crht6,Dtapped,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:10:57 2015 UTC,"It's possible, I own around 7 and they don't usually ball up for at least 2-3 hours if I don't apply them too heavily, and they last on average a good 4-5 before fading without eating for me - air getting into the product if the tube was broken could definitely cause the product to go thicker and dried/gluggy"

AustralianMakeup,3crk0k,ToniNoir,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:26:40 2015 UTC,Interesting to know. I'm a pale neutral/slightly cool and their brow set and highlighter/contour duo are way too warm for me. Might have to check this out though.

AustralianMakeup,3cnegv,starward-,2,Thu Jul 9 06:46:42 2015 UTC,"So a friend asked me for a comparison and I thought it might be helpful for someone in the sub too (especially since Midnight is currently $4.95 with an extra 30% off). Overall formula wise I far prefer Knight, but I am a matte girl. Sportsgirl lipsticks seem to either come in a creamy glossier formula or a matte formula, and Midnight is the former, Knight is the latter. Actually when I first swatched Midnight in store I seriously disliked how slippy and glossy it was, but on the lips it performs better. You still won't get great wear or anything out of it. Knight hangs around basically forever, and survived my very greasy dinner last night with minimal wear.   Colour wise, I feel like Knight should have really been called Midnight haha. Knight is a dark navy blue while Midnight is a much lighter blue leaning teal. FYI to anyone like me who almost missed Knight in store - I was actually disappointed my store didn't have night but went to check out the dark chocolate looking colour which actually turned out to be Knight. The lipstick itself looks pretty much black, and the base colour part looks dark brown. I actually had to swatch it in store even after seeing it here to make sure I was getting the right one. The colours are worlds apart overall, and you can definitely justify owning both if that's your thing.  If anyone has any other questions I'd be happy to answer them :)"

AustralianMakeup,3cmnde,asteroyale,21,Thu Jul 9 02:22:50 2015 UTC,That's my birthday - Cheers to me! :D  The main thing that makes me feel better about our longer release waits is that it gives plenty of time for the products to be swatched & reviewed by others - helping me decide if I really do like/want/need it before just snapping it up without being about to research it.

AustralianMakeup,3cmnde,compactgirlfriend,3,Thu Jul 9 02:37:39 2015 UTC,"I can speak for the bronzer! I bought both of them! The lighter ones gives you the nicest glow and subtle contour!

AustralianMakeup,3cmht2,Jessijames,26,Thu Jul 9 01:38:11 2015 UTC,"High end makeup for people who know nothing about makeup. Overpriced poor quality makeup. I've never had any of my own but I've used a powder foundation, an eyeshadow palette, pencil liner and a lipstick, as well as a few brushes, all that I borrowed off my friend. The powder was cakey, the brushes were harsh, the liner faded quickly and the eyeshadow had no pigmentation and didn't blend. The lipstick was decent, but probably not worth the price. My aunt has to wear Napoleon Perdis for work (Qantas flight attendant) and hates it, hates how expensive it is and hates the quality, she's a Lancome diehard. The MUAs in the pop up stores are poorly trained and are sales people before they are MUAs.  All that said, NP Set lipsticks are quite nice and I've heard good things about their eye primer and face primer."
AustralianMakeup,3cmht2,criti_biti,12,Thu Jul 9 04:07:59 2015 UTC,High end makeup for people who know nothing about makeup.   This is exactly accurate to describe how I've always thought about them - Overpriced to boot. I had hoped maybe over the last few years they may have improved like the majority of drugstore brands have but it would appear not. So glad I've never bothered with them now!
AustralianMakeup,3cmht2,StrangeFarulf,5,Thu Jul 9 04:48:01 2015 UTC,How can they make you wear a specific brand of makeup for work? Like how can they police that?
AustralianMakeup,3cmht2,criti_biti,5,Thu Jul 9 05:46:37 2015 UTC,"NP and Qantas have a partnership and its heavily suggested that they wear NP, in specific lip colours too, but its not actually compulsory. If it were compulsory, Qantas would have to reimburse expenses because it would be considered uniform. If you choose not to wear NP you still have to wear the uniform lip colours in whatever brand you choose. My olive-skinned, black haired aunt looks garish in the red-orange and vibrant fuschia that are uniform colours but thats what she has to wear. I don't think you have the option of not wearing makeup either."
AustralianMakeup,3cmht2,phattoes,2,Thu Jul 9 05:51:12 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I've found their products hit and miss. Their bb cream and primer are wonderful but I agree with you on their powder big time!! I have an eyeshadow too and it's ok. I was given a sample of their mascara and it was horrible but the lipstick sample was really good, long wear without getting flakey."
AustralianMakeup,3cmht2,pondicus,2,Thu Jul 9 14:50:28 2015 UTC,"Yes to ALL of this. It's peddled by all the beauty editors and bloggers, but in reality, I doubt no MUA worth their reputation and worth would ever use Napoleon.  There are drugstore primers better quality and cheaper than Autopilot imho. Then again, it never agreed with my dry-sensitive skin - so it might actually work really well for some."
AustralianMakeup,3cmht2,Crumpet92,3,Thu Jul 9 08:04:03 2015 UTC,"Not worth it. Alright quality, but over priced and they don't have the greatest selection. If you have tan skin and a little bit darker than that's great, but if your pale I doubt you could get the right shade of foundation. They only seem to cater to warmer undertones. Their eye shadows had minimal pigmentation but I own some NP set shadows that have amazing pigmentation. I don't know how they worked that out. I own their brush set. I don't regret it as I use them everyday but they don't have great foundation brushes and didn't have anything for blending eye shadows. I recently got some Real Techniques face brushes which are way better quality. Their eye liner dries out super quick. I never got through more than half of one before it dried out, and I could never get it back to a workable consistency. Own a couple of lip things, but they're nothing to rave about. Lately I've been reaching for a lip gloss by them called Peach which is a really pretty colour, but very sticky. I've had either full size or samples of products in their prime range and I don't really notice a difference, they don't wow me. Had my make up done by a couple of their artists and that went okay. It was a very full heavy face that took ages to do but I felt like I could do the same in 10 mins, there was no contouring or anything. First time I had it done she colour matched me to a Look 3 and sold me that. I took it back and got a Look 2, than had to go back and get a Look 1. There's better products for cheaper."
AustralianMakeup,3cmht2,VelociraptorAlex,3,Thu Jul 9 04:50:19 2015 UTC,"Their autopilot primer is identical to the Face of Australia primer in the purple tube (identical ingredient list, look and feel the same it's been suggested that NP is a repackaged version or vice versa), their foundation is terrible shade wise and for wear time. For the same amount of money you could get a lovely high end foundation, and for eyes and lips you could find numerous shades and finishes for far less in ""drugstore"" brands. NP lipsticks are $30-38 roughly; you could get an iconic, well reviewed shade from MAC for that price. NP is definitely not worth the prices"
AustralianMakeup,3cmht2,ArrghUrrgh,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:25:28 2015 UTC,"There was drama a few years back when a few bloggers pointed out theres quite a few NP products (foundation particularly) that were just re-badged (not even repackaged!) cheap stuff.   I tried napoleon once, my gran bought me a nice neutral eyeshadow and a pigment, a long long time ago. Then went I went to the store the girls ganged up to try bully me into orange foundation, thankfully my mum rescued me :)"
AustralianMakeup,3cmht2,Flippantry,2,Thu Jul 9 21:45:58 2015 UTC,"A friend of mine worked at Napoleon and she stands adamantly against the makeup.  She said that the more she worked with it whilst exploring other brands personally, the more she realised it was garbage and prone to breaking her and some other people she knew out.    I've only ever tried a couple of their lip products which aren't too bad but I had got them on sale.  I don't know if I'd ever pay full price for any of their products."
AustralianMakeup,3cmht2,onehungrydinosaur,2,Thu Jul 9 05:48:59 2015 UTC,"I think some (or all?) of their cosmetics are repackaged. There's talk of it online on blogs and such, so that's always been enough to put me off. Especially considering the prices they charge!"
AustralianMakeup,3cmht2,StrattonLove,2,Thu Jul 9 07:57:50 2015 UTC,"The NP aesthetic doesn't appeal to me, so I've never set foot in a store, let alone buy anything. NARS has the aesthetic that appeals to me most, so it's not a surprise that it was my very first experience with mid-range/high-end makeup.   One of my friends loves NP and she let me swatch some of their products when I rummaged through her makeup. What NARS is to me is what NP is to her -- it's the first department-store brand we delved into and it's our go-to brands. I was surprised about the prices they charged for their products though.   I can tell you what to avoid:   Foundation with a in-built brush tip -- the product's ok. I just don't like that design. I'm not sure if the brush tip is detachable but if it isn't, that's unhygienic. It's designed to not waste any foundation, but you'll need to wash that brush tip regularly anyway.  Ultimate Contour Palette -- the packaging felt cheap, the product felt cheap and not worth the price. The powders were just... chalky and lacked pigment. It's no wonder my friend was disappointed at her first attempt to contour."
AustralianMakeup,3cmht2,gasolinerainbow,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:23:33 2015 UTC,"NARS is such an amazing brand. I have honestly never regretted buying a product of theirs, everything I have gotten has been exactly as great as I wanted it to be."

I am so filled with regret about wasting so much money, but at least I know that I'll probably never purchase anything from them again.

AustralianMakeup,3cmht2,Darmop,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:13:58 2015 UTC,"Don't like the makeup, or their aesthetic. It pulls a little garish for me. I have a friend who loves it, but she's into a more ""drag"" style look.   I had my makeup done there once (couldn't get an appointment at my usual Mecca), and it sucked. Way too light a foundation, and flashed back even though I specifically said if was for my engagement party and there would be photos."
AustralianMakeup,3cmht2,Teacupbunny,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:36:42 2015 UTC,"Some of it is ok, some of it is terrible. They do a mineral foundation which is reasonably priced and I love it.  I've also loved all the eyeshadow quads, but for the same price you can get a palette like Two Faced's chocolate bar (way more options and slightly better in my opinion). Their mascaras have all been terrible in my experience. I did buy a blush palette and a highlighting palette, both of which I adore, but quite expensive for what they are. Lipsticks are great, but cost similar to MAC and I think MAC are far superior. I mentioned this in another thread, but I find their brushes to be pretty terrible and I can't tell much difference between them and cheap no-name eBay finds. Keeping all of this in mind, I pretty much never buy anything from them unless there is a sale or a gift with purchase, seems a bit better value."
AustralianMakeup,3cmht2,thatlipsticklady,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:04:41 2015 UTC,I think they're terribly overpriced. It's just so strange to me that they can sell a foundation for $70 when you can go to a different brand with a far better colour range and a natural finish (but still full coverage) for less than $50. Some of their SAs are fantastic MUAs but I've come across some haven't been trained well at all.
AustralianMakeup,3cmht2,shelteredsun,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:45:22 2015 UTC,"A friend of a friend is a MUA for them, so literally all the makeup my friend owns is NP. I never told her because I didn't want to make her feel bad but honestly it was terrible quality for the price she was paying, even with the friend giving her discounts. I'm pretty sure her persistent adult acne is mostly caused by the foundation, the eyeshadows are pretty in the pan but lack pigment and the skincare is just stupidly expensive.  She gave me a few things she had gotten as GWPs and I tried them, to be honest I'm still using the mascara but only because I can't afford to buy a better one right now. If I had paid $40 for it I would be livid as it flakes and smudges like crazy."

AustralianMakeup,3cmht2,berlin_chair_,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:47:41 2015 UTC,"I have some of their eye shadows but I don't think I've paid anything close to full price for them, smaller pharmacies have super discounted/discontinued lines and I'd pick the colours I usually go for so every shade of green. The loose ones tend to be better pigmented than the pressed but the two or so pressed ones I have are ok pigment wise, a little goes a long way so I haven't even hit pan on them but I think it's more to do with me just not reaching for them as much as something else I have. Meh longevity wize so I'm glad I paid less than $10/$5 for them."
AustralianMakeup,3cmht2,SizzlingVivacity,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:24:13 2015 UTC,"I have one NP product. It's one of their colour discs (eyeshadow singles) in the shade Scarlet Woman, which is a very true, matte red. I bought it for a costume party for $29 and I don't mind it. I will occasionally mix it with a matte black when I want to custom blend up a cranberry shade. I don't have any complaints about that shadow, but I don't have anything nice to say about anything else they sell."
AustralianMakeup,3cmht2,Tuipie,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:12:10 2015 UTC,"OK I have a little contour palette from NP that I love... it cost waaaay too much though. What was I thinking?

AustralianMakeup,3cm4ri,IrmaGehrd,7,Wed Jul 8 23:53:28 2015 UTC,"Hourglass ALP in Dim Light - super soft and buttery, I use as a finishing powder and it brings the most beautiful subtle glow. A little costly but totally worth it! I've had mine for a year at least, use it daily, still yet to hit pan. This is my HG.  The Balm Mary Loumanizer - I like this for a more shimmery, concentrated highlight, mostly for evenings. Great for browbone, inner corner of eye and Cupid's bow. Stupidly cheap for a massive pan, I feel like this will last for a lifetime! I think I paid around $20 at DJs."

Because it's a cream though, it has a tendency to remove the foundation underneath if applied with brush strokes. Dabbing is best :)  Revlon skinlights - a liquid illuminator I mix with my foundation. Very subtle and blends really well into the skin"

AustralianMakeup,3cm4ri,Joolebear,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:41:03 2015 UTC,I've swatched the NYX and the Australis ones before and found them too glittery. Am I just applying it wrong?
AustralianMakeup,3cm4ri,originalaliswan,2,Thu Jul 9 04:04:33 2015 UTC,I really like Laura mercier's baked matte radiance powder in shade 01. Becca Shimmering pressed perfector in the shade moonlight is a bit meh for me but I'm hoping the shade champagne pop (coming to me from the US!) will pack more of a punch.
AustralianMakeup,3cm4ri,elladora,2,Thu Jul 9 05:56:39 2015 UTC,"I've been using the top two-three rows of the Physician's Formula shimmer brick thingy for a highlight lately. So nice and glowy! No chunky glitter, just glow. And so affordable when you purchase from iHerb rather than Priceline :)  Packaging is unnecessarily clunky though.   But my favourite highlight would be MUG's foiled eyeshadow in In The Spotlight. Such a gorgeous glowy pink - VERY intense highlight.   Also, naturally, the Mary-Lou Manizer is another of my favourites."

AustralianMakeup,3cm4ri,Pandarmonium,3,Thu Jul 9 06:26:09 2015 UTC,"Model's Prefer has some good ones! Try their Soft Focus range.   Worst case scenario, you can always repurpose a highlight shade in an eyeshadow palette to test your technique.  Your other option is indie products, like Femme Fatale Cosmetics up in Queensland who stock a range of great highlighters in a bunch of shades and brands for under $10 :)"
AustralianMakeup,3cm4ri,starward-,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:10:58 2015 UTC,"Seconding Model's Prefer for reasonably priced highlighters. I know a lot of people have likened the MP highlighters to a great drugstore version of Hourglasses's ALP. I did, however, find that I needed to scratch off the top hardened layer from my MP highlighter to get to a good stuff."

I believe it's still available online at priceline and at some chemists), chi chi baked eyeshadow in 'call me' or l'oreal infallible eyeshadow in 'hourglass beige'. Super pigmented and lasts so long on my combo skin!"

AustralianMakeup,3cj258,rogue_rogue,12,Wed Jul 8 08:18:28 2015 UTC,"I know this is a Buzzfeed article, but it popped up in my Facebook news feed today. It's actually pretty interesting that with the current exchange rate we are really only paying a few more dollars for most things than Americans are. My brother is going to America in a few months and I was going to give him a list of things to get me, but It looks like the only things that will be worth bringing back will be from MAC. I think I'll just pick up the rest of the things from Mecca here!"
AustralianMakeup,3cj258,WarlockPanda,43,Wed Jul 8 08:22:28 2015 UTC,"Key words here are ""at the current exchange rate"". Do you remember back in 2011 when the exchange rate hit a historical high? Prices were not revised to reflect the change at all and given that the AUD was strong for such a persistent amount of time with most economists agreeing that it would remain high due to quantitative easing in the US, prices should have dropped. But they didn't.   Also there is a serious selection bias in the article. The person who wrote it did not seem to pick out some of the key brands that are well known for price gouging Australians (e.g. Revlon and Loreal) There are particular product which are much more likely to have a large markup in the Australian market ( eg colorstay foundation)  The analysis would be better if the markups were displayed as a percentage markup on the base price. Otherwise you don't really gain too much from looking at the numbers other that the prices are slightly higher. You will find major disparities between the markup on ""drugstore"" and HE products in Australia. The drugstore level is where we get hit hardest in terms of markup."
AustralianMakeup,3cj258,WarlockPanda,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:14:55 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, I was actually in America in 2012 when the exchange rate was above parity in our favour, and the haul of make-up that I brought home with me was pretty insane. At the time I was using a Clinique mascara that retailed for over $40 here, and I was able to get it in Sephora there for about $16 which is absolutely ridiculous.   I'm more thinking about right at this very moment with the current exchange rate though. No one will save any money by trying to import from America right now, the hassle is not worth the minuscule saving. Mecca is a great option.    And yes, I know they have just used a random selection, and the drugstore items generally have the most markup, but I personably never buy drugstore brands full price in Australia, so I am more interested personally in the Mecca/Sephora brands. And really, the only drugstore item I actually regularly use is mascara (for various reasons) and I know that 40% off sales come up super frequently, so I just stock up then.   As for everything else, I've done a bit of number crunching for things on my list, and all of the Hourglass items are exactly the same price here at the moment after exchange rate conversion, so I'll just buy them here. Same with Nars. The Benefit items all still workout to be cheaper in America, and so do MAC so they'll stay on my list."
AustralianMakeup,3cj258,neodeone,3,Wed Jul 8 13:38:11 2015 UTC,I think the whole TL;DR of the post is - you should never pay full price for low end products!
AustralianMakeup,3cj258,Stinkysnarly,6,Wed Jul 8 21:26:54 2015 UTC,"I wrote a post on this around a year ago that seems to be quite popular here (it's in the sidebar http://ashleighcalder.blogspot.com.au/2014/08/the-problem-of-pricing.html?m=1) where I did quite a bit of research into the markups on cosmetics in Australia. we get badly gouged at a drugstore level with revlon, loreal and maybelline often being the worst offenders but high end makeup is often far closer to US parity. really it just happens because the brands can because they'll gain profit from them and there's nothing we can really do to stop them :("
AustralianMakeup,3cj258,neodeone,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:19:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks I'll use this. I think it's about percentage of added cost and brand availability. We just got some NYX, no Milani, Jordana, Collection etc. we have limited drugstore & high end like UD etc. They didn't mention my Physicians Formula Eye Booster $29.95 IF it's in stock. The median wage isn't better here but we pay a huge amount more for 'staples' like MAC lipstick and Revlon Colourstay foundations.   Edited to add: Illamasqua has a price parity policy for AU pricing"

AustralianMakeup,3cj258,chocolatespeckle,5,Thu Jul 9 04:45:21 2015 UTC,"I seriously need to update my AUS/US price comparison spreadsheet, but I think the most important thing to do is just shop around and weigh up your options. I only ever buy 'drugstore' makeup when there's a 40% or more off sale, and I don't buy any mid-high end makeup without comparing with US RRP and online prices first. There's no set percentage markup for any of the brands... different items just within the one brand will vary on markup, making some products worth buying in Australia and others not. Whether or not I feel I'm being ripped off as an aussie really varies depending on the item, the exchange rate, and time and shipping costs.   We are really fortunate that Mecca has their price promise on a lot of the really popular mid-high end brands, but there are definitely still products from other brands that are worth getting from overseas if you have the chance. Especially if you don't have to pay for shipping since your brother will be bringing them back! I'm planning a US Sephora haul for later this year and on my list already are several Clinique Cheek Pops, Becca SSPs, and maybe a Benefit blush. We are definitely being ripped off on those three brands in Australia.  Also, yes I was comparing Guerlain prices the other week and also noticed that Guerlain seems to be cheaper here than in the US?! Now I want to go out and buy some Guerlain just because I feel like I'm getting a good deal lol."
AustralianMakeup,3cj258,score1fortheprincess,5,Wed Jul 8 09:55:48 2015 UTC,I think the most important thing to do is just shop around and weigh up your options   As someone who is incredibly cheap I totally agree with this. One of the main reasons I started browsing this sub was so that I could be more up to date with sales. I think with anything you buy it's impulse purchases where you can lose out.

AustralianMakeup,3chshn,lady_hazel,2,Wed Jul 8 01:25:13 2015 UTC,I'm about the same as you spend-wise - I usually end up spending at least $200 or so a qtr and around Xmas time I hit the $400 as I buy a lot of gifts as well. I have brothers and no sisters so I buy them a bunch of smellies and shavies and soaps etc to last them the year because they're lazy and just buy crap stuff haha and I usually make up a nice gift basket for my Mum as well.

Still no voucher yet, but I don't really mind - getting some new info on their potential changes is interesting enough!   I'm glad Priceline are taking steps towards giving us a 'better deal' - they're likely well aware of the price gap between here and other countries. They don't choose the RRP, the brands do so by giving us more and more decent sales and offers really helps sweeten the pot for me when places like Target & Big W give us a big sale (30-40% off) less often and without other bonus perks. I am more than happy to continue buying essentially all of my beauty & health related products at Priceline. Thumbs up to them!"

I called them up not long after to change my postal address so I'd get my future vouchers and they said 'oh by the way, you've got all these unused vouchers want me to get them resent out to you?'

AustralianMakeup,3cikeg,jknee88,5,Wed Jul 8 04:41:46 2015 UTC,"I do concealer before foundation. Mainly because my concealer is a bit to light and this hides it. Conditioner before shampoo? No way. Shampoo opens the cuticle of the hair and conditioner shuts it. Your ruining your colour and making it more prone to damage doing it the other way round. If you have fine hair there are shampoo/conditioners aimed for you.    Lipstick/liner. I do liner first. At MAC the other day she did liner afterwards, I do have tricky lips where parts are my skin colour, so I understand why. Maybe if my liner was lighter and I was trying to highlight something I would.    I've been powdering before my liquid foundation (Wayne Goss method) and LOVE it. My face lasts so much longer and it's a more youthful look because the skin looks dewy."
AustralianMakeup,3cikeg,Crumpet92,4,Wed Jul 8 08:23:56 2015 UTC,"I also use the Wayne Goss foundation method.

I don't really do anything exciting, but I always do my eye makeup before my face makeup, and people seem to think that's strange? (But, I don't want to risk getting eyeshadow on my foundation, it also gives my face primer time to sink in, AND I have skin that hates me so it means my foundation lasts like 20 minutes longer than it would before it looks horrible, so I swear there's reasons!)"

AustralianMakeup,3ci03q,jamballdonut,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:38:20 2015 UTC,"Can you tell me which one it is, exactly? I looked for it when I was last in Priceline and wasn't sure so I bought nothing, haha."
AustralianMakeup,3ci03q,SchultzAL,2,Wed Jul 8 08:40:52 2015 UTC,"I'm using one that was limited edition, so it was released about a year ago, sorry!  I know the cream to powder one (Soo Glow!) is super popular though! (I own that one too, in the pinkier shade, and I've only used it a few times, but it's pretty great from what I've experienced!) It is super popular though, so it's possible it's just constantly sold out?"
AustralianMakeup,3ci03q,jamballdonut,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:59:47 2015 UTC,"I saw the Soo Glow one, but wasn't sure about it. I'll probably pick it up next time I'm at Priceline. Thanks! :)"
AustralianMakeup,3ci03q,SchultzAL,2,Wed Jul 8 10:40:47 2015 UTC,"I think it's a Sephora Exclusive right now at least in the US so it's entirely possible DJ's won't get the rights to distribute it. I am tempted to get it when I do a US buy sometime in the next month but am still on the fence between that and Opal. I think Champagne Pop will suit me better than Opal however!  I didn't even realise DJ's still had Becca counters, I've not seen one in any DJ's for a long long time! If anyone in Melb knows of a DJ's that has a Becca counter hit me up."
AustralianMakeup,3ci03q,Jessijames,2,Wed Jul 8 02:25:49 2015 UTC,I just saw this on instagram - http://i.imgur.com/p93qnF0.png so it sounds like yes but they don't mention where it'll be sold at all. I'd keep an eye out on their facebook page!
AustralianMakeup,3ci03q,freezethefire,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:46:11 2015 UTC,"Possibly, in store wise I'd say they would be more likely to appear in Sephora in Sydney as they have the bulk of Becca's other products as well - DJ's seem to be pretty lacklustre (don't seem to even have the original highlighters from my quick online squiz). Not to mention everything seems to get here 6 months after the USA gets it sigh. Or if you definitely can't wait, use a mail forwarding service to buy it from Sephora USA (ahhh the joys of being a makeup junkie in Australia)"
AustralianMakeup,3ci03q,ladyhellcat,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:19:08 2015 UTC,I always thought that it was a sephora exclusive - is that not the case?   You could always get someone to buy it for you on /r/makeupexchange

AustralianMakeup,3cdf9x,DarkHatexx,8,Tue Jul 7 01:22:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the warning! I wanted to buy the Benefit Hoola and browsed around eBay to see if I could find it any cheaper than the $51 at Myer's/adorebeauty. Saw someone selling it for $28, so I messaged them to ask for photos since they only had one stock photo on their listing. Been a few days and they have yet to respond. I did check their feedback and they were selling a bunch of Benefit They're Real Mascara and all the feedback was positive... But I still find the lack of actual photos off putting. Only having stock photos for a product that you claim to be authentic and you're selling for $28 instead of $51 seems too good to be true..."
AustralianMakeup,3cdf9x,manicmoon,5,Tue Jul 7 02:13:08 2015 UTC,"You can buy direct from the US Benefit website and pay US prices! It probably isn't the best value right now with the poor Aussie dollar, but you'd still be saving something!"
AustralianMakeup,3cdf9x,onehungrydinosaur,2,Tue Jul 7 02:26:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've tried doing that but the total cost including shipping would be $62, so it would be cheaper to grab it at Myers. Thanks for the tip though!"
AustralianMakeup,3cdf9x,manicmoon,6,Tue Jul 7 02:28:57 2015 UTC,You do get free shipping if you spend over $130 IIRC - You may not want to spend that much just to save the $15-20 in shipping but if you were looking to stock up on a few Benefit items it might work out better :)
AustralianMakeup,3cdf9x,Jessijames,3,Tue Jul 7 03:58:06 2015 UTC,Maybe you could do a joint order with someone to get the free shipping? (over $125 i think)
AustralianMakeup,3cdf9x,Haibarai,2,Tue Jul 7 03:57:37 2015 UTC,Oh damn! Shipping is the worst part :(

AustralianMakeup,3cdf9x,jen-iscool,5,Tue Jul 7 09:59:47 2015 UTC,You shouldn't use them at all. You have no way of knowing what the ingredients are or if it is toxic.

You should definitely leave negative feedback, and maybe consider reporting the seller to eBay."
AustralianMakeup,3cdf9x,Flippantry,3,Tue Jul 7 02:54:07 2015 UTC,I actually sent them a message directly asking them to remove the fake items. If not ill definitely report it.

AustralianMakeup,3carmb,neccessarygirl,6,Mon Jul 6 13:14:46 2015 UTC,"I really like the NYX photo ready primer, but I mostly need pore and line filling. It makes my foundation feel crazy soft and velvety.   I've heard good things about the elf color based primers though :)"
AustralianMakeup,3carmb,3xpretty,2,Mon Jul 6 13:26:08 2015 UTC,"I like this one too, and feel it holds the foundation on longer from creasing/caking. Better than the Hourglass Veil Mineral."
AustralianMakeup,3carmb,carnageincminor,4,Tue Jul 7 04:41:15 2015 UTC,"I think it also depends on what type of primer you're looking for, and what skin type you have.  Some people look for pore filling/smoothing, so they'll look for primers with dimethicone (This is a silicone-type ingredient that makes it all smooth and nice) or glycerin (Which is kind of sticky/tacky, so it makes foundation stick to your face) - Obviously there are going to be plenty of primers out there that don't have either of those 2 ingredients in them, but I thought I'd mention them!  I have normal to dry and dehydrated skin, so I look for something that's hydrating and that's going to stick to my skin, so I've actually been loving the Nivea Post Shave Balm (Not a primer, I know, but it's the best thing that I've ever used on my skin) - No other primer I've tried has ever worked as well as that one.  For days when I want my pores/nose to look smoother/nicer, I'll go for the Benefit Porefessional or the Australis Cya Later Pores Spot Primer.  Both do around the same job, so I just go for whatever I feel like using!  eta: I also DEFINITELY notice when I don't use a primer! My makeup doesn't apply as smoothly, it barely lasts 5 minutes, and it clings to all my dry spots and just looks terrible.  If I'm in too much of a rush to use primer, I'll at least use a nice hydrating moisturiser."
AustralianMakeup,3carmb,jamballdonut,5,Tue Jul 7 10:53:43 2015 UTC,"I love the Hourglass Mineral Veil Primer. I've been using it for a couple of years now.  It's crazy expensive but you don't need much.   Just a tip that you may or may not know, it is recommended that you use water based primers with water based foundations and oil based primers with oil based foundations."
AustralianMakeup,3carmb,assaulted_peanuts,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:43:17 2015 UTC,I've just started using this. I really like it so far. An application tips from an experienced user?
AustralianMakeup,3carmb,passthemustard,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:44:43 2015 UTC,"I found that the pump bottle (if you have that) can separate, so I grab a chopstick or knife and mix it around before pumping it out. Due to this reason, I decided to get the largest bottle and it's far better.   Also, I apply about 1/4tsp after my moisturiser and sunscreen and just use my fingers and pat it in and rub it in lightly around my nose (which has lots of visible pores).    Then just wait 5 minutes and go ahead with your foundation/powder :)"
AustralianMakeup,3carmb,assaulted_peanuts,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:41:00 2015 UTC,"It's also mainly recommended for oily-combo skin. My dry-sensitive skin and makeup really liked it, but not as much as it liked the Too Faced Primed and Poreless, which was more moisturising."
AustralianMakeup,3carmb,pondicus,3,Wed Jul 8 06:56:02 2015 UTC,"I love love love the $5 W7 primer! It's super silky and makes my foundation last a lot longer. I get really bad hives on my face from allergies sometimes and this primer even helps to hide them! I've found W7 products to be pretty good, but this primer blew me away. It can be found at Chemist Warehouse."
AustralianMakeup,3carmb,eihpos,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:21:32 2015 UTC,"I've recently been using the Mecca Soft Focus primer and I really like it so far. My skin looks and feels really smooth, makes it a dream to apply my foundation (Nars Sheer Glow)."
AustralianMakeup,3carmb,bbaek,2,Mon Jul 6 14:09:38 2015 UTC,Second! So good with sheer glow!
AustralianMakeup,3carmb,Tonkie,2,Mon Jul 6 22:42:20 2015 UTC,"Do you happen to know how it compares with the Nars primers? The girl at Mecca gave me a sample of the Light Optimizing one when I picked up Sheer Glow. It's fluffy and smooth and it smells nice, but... it doesn't seem to do anything compared to when I don't use it."
AustralianMakeup,3carmb,Kitkatboom,3,Tue Jul 7 03:04:37 2015 UTC,"I have both and prefer the Mecca! It doesn't have the shimmer the NARS has, but it is smoother and I prefer it with the sheer glow :)"
AustralianMakeup,3carmb,Tonkie,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:03:13 2015 UTC,"I have cool toned, normal to dry skin. I'd recommend:  Models prefer liquid light: this is one of those primers that just feels like a moisturiser, but it smoothes the skin really well and extends the wear of my foundation really well.  Np set brightening primer: this is oil based, and much more sparkly. Otherwise similar. More expensive  Hourglass no. 28 primer serum: this is amazing. If your skin is dry, this is gold. Not only does it help my foundation go on beautifully, it makes my skin feel really supple and healthy. And smells amazing."
AustralianMakeup,3carmb,starla_,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:20:45 2015 UTC,I've tried a buttload of primers on my dry-sensitive skin and my favourite so far has been Too Faced Primed and Poreless. Lasts forever in the tube and isn't too crazy overpriced.

I also love your choice of lip colour, it's a really complimentary nude colour for your skin. I would probably play up the eyes just a little more. Try using your fingers and dab the Mary Lou lightly in the centre of your lids, blending it out just so you can see a clear shimmer. Take the darkhorse and use it to smoke out your upper lash liner a little above the liquid eyeliner line. I would really recommend curling the lashes more or even applying some natural falsies. Define the tails of your eyebrows a little by outlining them sharply with a soft brown eyeshadow and a thin flat brush. This is just a personal opinion, but I hope it helps. :)"

AustralianMakeup,3c9ibl,jamballdonut,2,Mon Jul 6 07:55:36 2015 UTC,Do you do this with a lip brush? How do you do touch ups throughout the day?
AustralianMakeup,3c9ibl,dasfkj,3,Tue Jul 7 05:55:29 2015 UTC,"If I mix colours I won't really touch them both up throughout the day, I'll switch to a lip gloss instead. Lipstick lasts ages on me, doesn't wear until I eat normally. So I can get away with being lazy. I don't tend to use a brush as I have more control using the actual lipstick. You definitely can though, it's personal preference. I normally apply one colour, than the other over it. Yesterday I applied one coat of each and it worked perfectly. Today I used Pure Heroine, than Myth and found it was to light for me so I dabbed a bit more of the Pure Heroine on top. I than run a finger across my lips just to make sure the colours have blended nicely."

AustralianMakeup,3c9ibl,Stelare,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:53:37 2015 UTC,"I just bought a tub yesterday at Chemist Warehouse after seeing the comments from /u/neccessarygirl and JJ! It's in the baby creams section :) My CW only had the tubs, the smallest being a 125g one which is what I got. Maybe try Priceline because their website lists a small tube version as well, which might be good for hygiene reasons. Also the cream is way thicker than I expected and there's no way I'll be able to get through it before it expires in 2020!"

AustralianMakeup,3c9ibl,Crumpet92,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:48:19 2015 UTC,Sudocream is also fantastic for allergic reactions/hives!  I use it for my eczema as well.  Getting a new tub tomorrow (I think I get the 250gm).
AustralianMakeup,3c9ibl,Crumpet92,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:27:51 2015 UTC,"I'm going to try this. I have eczema, too. Much more worse when I was a kid, but still a nuisance. (Especially with how pricey the prescription ointments are)."
AustralianMakeup,3c9ibl,Crumpet92,5,Fri Jul 10 02:46:19 2015 UTC,"Some probably well known ones but: lipstick as a cream blush, highlighter on the lid and bronzer in the crease for a put together look, also depending on your blush colour a tiny bit in the crease can tie your look together...or so I've heard on YouTube :p"
AustralianMakeup,3c8zf1,Pandibabi,5,Mon Jul 6 00:42:41 2015 UTC,"Kmart has some cheap ones too, I got mine from there. They have different sized on too. I can't find them online though."
AustralianMakeup,3c8zf1,jen-iscool,3,Mon Jul 6 01:27:57 2015 UTC,"http://www.kmart.com.au/product/homemaker-bathroom-cosmetic-organiser---medium/133809 Kmart has the exact same one for $7! I have it myself. Agree with the other comments about it getting dirty. I store mine in a drawer though, and find it useful because instead of having to rummage through a drawer full of products, I know exactly which slot everything is meant to be in. Which comes in handy since I usually wear glasses so it's frustrating trying to find things without my glasses on and my fingers covered in foundation."

AustralianMakeup,3c8zf1,jen-iscool,4,Mon Jul 6 03:06:52 2015 UTC,"I purchased one of these last time they stocked them, and tbh I was disappointed. The little sections were oddly shaped and I struggled to sit products correctly. I also found that, being open, they collected lots of dust, fallout, brush hairs etc and were really difficult to clean properly! In the end I got rid of it and purchased a set of clear acrylic drawers that are much more functional :)"
AustralianMakeup,3c8zf1,kdarmy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:17:58 2015 UTC,"I agree that they collect gunk and are hard to clean. I only use storage like this for lipsticks and they are on a shelf in a wardrobe, so they don't get dirty."
AustralianMakeup,3c8zf1,SchultzAL,2,Mon Jul 6 02:22:32 2015 UTC,I got mine from stacks variety store for $7 this was almost 6 months ago so avalibilty and pricing may be different
AustralianMakeup,3c8zf1,EriApples,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:19:26 2015 UTC,Anyone know of a neat way to store lipstick? I was thinking of getting one of the holders with all the square slots but I'm worried dust would get inside sitting ontop of my dresser.
AustralianMakeup,3c8zf1,asteroyale,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:50:44 2015 UTC,I use something like this (Not my image) to store them. They dont really get dusty in there. I can take a pic of mine when i get home.

AustralianMakeup,3c8zf1,asteroyale,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:56:37 2015 UTC,No worries :) I own 3 and probably ended up buying them from a different seller each time because I just looked up who had it for the cheapest each time haha they do take about 3-4 minimum to arrive in the mail though.
AustralianMakeup,3c8zf1,Jessijames,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:02:32 2015 UTC,How sturdy and scratch-proof are they?
AustralianMakeup,3c8zf1,asteroyale,2,Mon Jul 6 04:14:59 2015 UTC,"10/10 for sturdiness, they're strongly made - the only thing I will add is that the slots can sometimes be out by a mm here or there. Like, some larger or square tubes of mine, if I tested each one out it might fit in most of the slots, some it might be a snug fit, there might be 1-2 in each tray that is too small - again only by a few mm and it doesn't bother me personally I just make sure slimmer/average sized tubes go in those ones. For the price, I really don't care haha  Scratch proof, this is a tough one. Mine only sit on my vanity and never move so they're not really scratched at all - I've not noticed much if any scratching from taking tubes in and out either but I am careful anyway. They are that average 'cheap' acrylic that will probably scratch easily if moved around a lot though so bear that in mind I suppose!"
AustralianMakeup,3c8zf1,Jessijames,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:26:57 2015 UTC,"I can support the whole ""they're all the same, dm what seller"" and like /u/Jessiejames, I just look for whose selling it the cheapest and I can attest to the month long wait (feels like forever!). I find these to be really great. They're quite sturdy and I just inspected one of my holders for scratches. There are definitely some there but they're not noticeable unless you look for them. Most of your lipsticks should fit into them unless the lean on the more bulky side (I've had the odd one or two not be able to fit). I also find that the surface on the edges can be a bit jagged but it's not a big deal to me."

AustralianMakeup,3c6ncq,score1fortheprincess,6,Sun Jul 5 09:53:18 2015 UTC,I am pretty sure all the prices are set in GBP's then are automatically converted to AUD according to the conversion rate. Everything is getting more expensive and by everything I mean makeup  :'(
AustralianMakeup,3c6ncq,gizzlemahizzle,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:45:44 2015 UTC,"I know! It looked promising a few months ago with the dollar improving, but now its plummeted again. Why does no one value our currency anymore?!?"
AustralianMakeup,3c6ncq,Teacupbunny,6,Sun Jul 5 20:52:42 2015 UTC,"If they increase their prices, I probably won't bother with them any more. The only thing that makes the wait time and questionable service worthwhile is that they are generally a lot cheaper. It's probably the AU dollar though."
AustralianMakeup,3c6ncq,Haibarai,2,Sun Jul 5 10:52:22 2015 UTC,"I've never had any issues with them, everything arrives within 2 weeks all safe and sound. It's just very odd how often the prices change. I'm hoping they don't keep inching skywards."
AustralianMakeup,3c6ncq,jamballdonut,1 point,Sun Jul 5 11:12:51 2015 UTC,I think they change everyday depending on the dollar.
AustralianMakeup,3c6ncq,rahhhj,3,Sun Jul 5 11:32:24 2015 UTC,"Ugh, this happened to me with some ABH products.  Was going to buy Dipbrow ($16) and a new Brow Wiz ($20), but my partner told me to wait until I really needed it.  Last I checked the Dipbrow was about $25 and the Brow Wiz was around $29.  $9 extra? No thanks, I'll just wait and hope the price comes back down.  (Also, I think the AU dollar is doing terribly at the moment? Because, I think I heard the gap between AU/US dollar recently got a few cents bigger, ugh.)"
AustralianMakeup,3c6ncq,jamballdonut,2,Mon Jul 6 02:47:09 2015 UTC,I feel ya! I bought the dipbrow and brow wiz when it was cheap and wanted to restock not long after I ran out. Now it's over $25 per product and I'm sitting here face palming myself for not stocking up on it earlier
AustralianMakeup,3c6ncq,idealgrind,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:38:25 2015 UTC,My Brow Wiz is so close to being out.  Even buying it on Urban Outfitters doesn't work out that cheap once you factor in currency conversion there too >:(

AustralianMakeup,3c6fjt,Jessijames,1 point,Sun Jul 5 08:47:58 2015 UTC,"Nah, haven't tried it on - I already have Disciple and it will probably last forever so I wasn't looking to buy.

AustralianMakeup,3c6fjt,sleuthycake,2,Sun Jul 5 22:43:10 2015 UTC,"I reckon it's a bit darker than the swatches I've seen of Abused - which is an utterly beautiful colour, but which I wouldn't buy because naming a bruise-looking blue Abused kind of squicks me out."
AustralianMakeup,3c6fjt,starward-,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:46:49 2015 UTC,"I'll have to re-look at swatches again, this looks lighter than Abused from my memory haha (but my memory is known to be shady at times...)

AustralianMakeup,3c6h3a,burnt_can,2,Sun Jul 5 07:58:09 2015 UTC,I enjoyed looking at your collection. Everything is so neat and tidy. Mine is a mess. Good luck with your audit!
AustralianMakeup,3c6h3a,WarlockPanda,1 point,Sun Jul 5 09:45:05 2015 UTC,nice collection!!  why dont you like the Colour Pop 'Coffee Break with Dani'? and how's the quality of the zoeva shadows? i really wanna try the cocoa blend palette!
AustralianMakeup,3c6h3a,gospursgo_,1 point,Sun Jul 5 08:10:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks :) This is my first time posting my collection.  I didn't realise that that the shadows for the Colour Pop were cream shadows when I bought them. So I was expecting really pigmented powder shadows. Personally, I find cream shadows difficult to work with as they are mostly sheer, difficult to blend and don't have good staying power like pigment or powder shadows. They certainly look great when swatching, but I don't see how I'll ever use them. Even when applying them to my lid, they sit there looking understated and remind me of kids makeup- not obvious and nearly hidden. But I must admit thats all my fault as I have not bothered to learn how to apply them correctly. I'm sure there must be a trick to application. I made up a look the other day for work and my lids just felt a tad bit greasy during the day, which they normally don't. I might try using them as an eyeliner next time. The Zoeva shadows are really great. I would say they are just below my Lorac Pro shadows in quality. They are creamy, and easy to blend. I would definitely purchase another palette from this brand. I also really like that they are so affordable."
AustralianMakeup,3c6h3a,asteroyale,1 point,Sun Jul 5 08:22:32 2015 UTC,"I've heard people say that they don't look as pigmented on the lids compared to swatches as well. I don't own any personally, but from Youtube and reddit, people say that using finger application gives a much better result. And from what I've seen, people just go over and over it again and just pack the color on. I don't know if that makes creasing really bad though."
AustralianMakeup,3c6h3a,Haibarai,1 point,Sun Jul 5 08:54:27 2015 UTC,"I have a few of the colour pop shadows and I personally love them. It is annoying that fingers give the most colour payoff  but I find a sponge applicator (sponge applicators rock imo :3) works just as well. In terms of pigmentation, it is probably slightly more sheer when you put them on the eyes depending on how you apply them but it builds up really well and I don't think creasing is an issue as I can wear them with or without primer for like 5-6 hours without seeing crease lines (I have oily but not super oily lids for context).  My only gripe with these shadows is that I'm constantly in fear of them drying out and they're annoying to store."
AustralianMakeup,3c6h3a,ToniNoir,1 point,Sun Jul 5 09:15:44 2015 UTC,That collection looks great. I will be looking out eagerly for your sale post. I adore and would love that Kat D palette.   Which would you say is your favourite Naked palette?
AustralianMakeup,3c6h3a,ToniNoir,1 point,Sun Jul 5 08:58:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks :D Great, well I'll be sure to add the Kat Von D Palette to my sale. Well that's a good question! I just had a look at the palettes and have to say that out of all the three original palettes, that Naked 1 is my favourite as its good a good blend of browns, metallic, sparkly and matte colours. It just seems more versatile and inviting. In terms of all the Naked palettes I've got, the one I've used the most, and hit pan with is 'Naked Flushed'. Here are pictures: Palette"
AustralianMakeup,3c6h3a,rowha,1 point,Sun Jul 5 09:18:08 2015 UTC,Fair enough. Thank you very much. I'll start saving my coins for that. :) I've been eying off naked 2 because I've heard it has a tendency to suit cool skin and I'm a cool leaning neutral. I also like the colours in it so that helps.
AustralianMakeup,3c6h3a,Shiavo,1 point,Sun Jul 5 09:51:29 2015 UTC,"Nice! The Benefit cheek palette is super cute!    I've been eyeing the Lorac Pro Palette, but I've got the Naked 1. Since you have both, do you think it's worthwhile for me to get the Lorac Pro?"
AustralianMakeup,3c1ybz,lipstickhodor,42,Sat Jul 4 00:34:33 2015 UTC,"MAC lipsticks are $16USD (approx. $21.28AUD as of 4/7/15) and their Australian RRP is $36AUD, a 69% markup. To me, that's a rip off. I only own one MAC lipstick (Cyber) and refuse to purchase them here. I can ask friends in the States to purchase one and ship it to me for less than the RRP. Same with Clinique Cheek Pops ($21USD = $27.94AUD and Aus RRP is $40AUD, 43% markup). If something has more than a 20% markup compared to its US conversion I won't buy it. I understand shipping costs, operating costs etc but I'm sick of being gouged by the Australian  cosmetics industry. Revlon/L'Oreal are the worst offenders - their foundations sell for $9-12USD in the US and $25-36AUD here.  It's the main reason I tend to stick to indies for unique products and makeup exchange for more mid to high end.  Edit: Factoring in an approx. 10% US sales tax, MAC lipsticks are $17.60USD which equals $23.41AUD, or a 53% markup."
AustralianMakeup,3c1ybz,Kirena,11,Sat Jul 4 02:32:25 2015 UTC,My Revlon foundation was $47 NZD. Thankfully I had a voucher... I'll stick to online shopping though. I've noticed sometimes chichi stuff is $10 AUD and $20 NZD which is -_-
AustralianMakeup,3c1ybz,Tuipie,8,Sat Jul 4 05:31:53 2015 UTC,Holy fu-- !!  I'm so sorry Kiwis have to pay that D;
AustralianMakeup,3c1ybz,pondicus,5,Sat Jul 4 07:01:26 2015 UTC,"Ouch! I don't really purchase Revlon since I get really shitty whenever I walk in Priceline/Target/Myer and see their prices. I'm like, you guys are considered drugstore in the US and you are charging mid end prices, nearly high end for some things in Australia. Quality is too hit and miss, and brand name is not high end fashion house so you don't really get to justifiably charge those prices. It just makes me too angry to outweigh any benefits or perks of any of their products. (Sorry for the rant).  ChiChi is a brand that I have no problems supporting as their BB cream is pretty good, but I'll usually wait for a sale at Target or Myer to purchase it. I'm trying to be more mindful of my purchases and spending thanks to /r/MakeupRehab.   New Zealanders get shafted harder than Aussies do, I feel sorry for you guys. I'm happy to be a mule for anything you need during Priceline's 40% sales, or Chemist Warehouse's glorious 50% off sales!"
AustralianMakeup,3c1ybz,Kirena,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:04:47 2015 UTC,Aww that's kind of you! It's what's driven me to indies/Asian Beauty/online shopping. I rarely buy in-store these days
AustralianMakeup,3c1ybz,Tuipie,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:18:47 2015 UTC,"I love indies <3 the flat rate shipping for internationals helps a lot.  I've just started getting into AB, but haven't purchased anything yet as I'm still researching and learning about it. I really want to try AB sunscreens."
AustralianMakeup,3c1ybz,Kirena,3,Sat Jul 4 07:28:26 2015 UTC,Yeah AB suncreens are a game-changer. It encourages me to wear it everyday which is good considering the hole in ozone layer.
AustralianMakeup,3c1ybz,Tuipie,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:36:22 2015 UTC,I have a family history of skin cancer so I'm very aware of excessive sun exposure. Which ones do you like?
AustralianMakeup,3c1ybz,Kirena,2,Sat Jul 4 07:42:20 2015 UTC,Oh I've only tried the Biore one every loves. So different from western sunblocks! It feels like a light moisturiser
AustralianMakeup,3c1ybz,Tuipie,2,Sat Jul 4 08:59:21 2015 UTC,Don't forget the tax in the US as well :)
AustralianMakeup,3c1ybz,Jessijames,2,Sat Jul 4 02:42:33 2015 UTC,"It varies from state to state in the US, but I think it's averaged at about 8-12% so it cancels out when you factor in GST in Australia. Does US Sephora charge sales tax online?"
AustralianMakeup,3c1ybz,Kirena,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:50:58 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I was just pointing it out as you hadn't mentioned it and it does bridge the gap a tiny bit between US pricing and Aus as I thought you were using Aus RRP which already includes our tax so by using our RRP it doesn't quite cancel it out. It still sucks that we have such huge mark up on MAC especially but the tax does bump that US $16 for a lipstick up a fraction more.   And with Sephora in the US, yes they do charge tax on top. I've purchased from them many times via people in the US and the tax is extra on the sites listed prices!"
AustralianMakeup,3c1ybz,Jessijames,2,Sat Jul 4 04:19:08 2015 UTC,"OK, I wasn't sure since I had a Canadian friend send me some stuff and she wasn't charged tax so I didn't know if US Sephora did. Some states like I think Ohio have no sales tax.   One other thing is because I live in a regional area, I have no access to a MAC store (4 hours away), Mecca (closest is Brisbane) or Sephora (so far away) so I can't get samples to try products like foundations or testers to swatch. My local Myer doesn't even have Benefit. So for me, I'm not going to fork out $65 to try a foundation like the NARS and have to either return it  or sell it on and lose money. The price differences sadly have other attached consequences instead of paying a ridiculous markup."
AustralianMakeup,3c1ybz,Kirena,2,Sat Jul 4 07:25:35 2015 UTC,Oh definitely! Up until about 18 months ago I lived in country Victoria and I know what that'd like. I didn't even think about buying anything from Mecca or any other counter brands because having to return via post etc is a nightmare -.-
AustralianMakeup,3c1ybz,Jessijames,2,Sat Jul 4 11:01:15 2015 UTC,I bought a Clinique cheek pop at the Estée Lauder outlet for $10 last week 😳 Is there a particular shade you're after? PM me if you'd like me to purchase for you.

AustralianMakeup,3c1ybz,Haibarai,2,Sun Jul 5 06:12:22 2015 UTC,Couldn't have said it better myself. I purchased one MAC lipstick here and have regretted it ever since; I currently have a friend in the US who is getting one for me. I refuse to use my own money for high end products; I'd rather wait until Christmas than fund the industry that rips us off so much.
AustralianMakeup,3c1ybz,lyzaw,2,Sat Jul 4 04:24:30 2015 UTC,"I kind of regret purchasing Cyber, only because I felt a little shafted after I really got into makeup and realised how badly we were being gouged on cosmetics. However, I still wear and use it because I still do enjoy it.  I have a very small list of products I want to try from MAC (and other brands) and I'm just waiting for them to come up on MUE for a good price. I also like waiting for gift cards and birthday money, it helps lessen the sting on products I do purchase in store or online in Australia."
AustralianMakeup,3c1ybz,Kirena,12,Sat Jul 4 07:12:12 2015 UTC,"Okay technically speaking, the rip off isn't makeup, but it is beauty related.

Dip lightly and tap that brush like your life depends on it otherwise you be getting a lovely splash of orange on your face (my first time trying it in a rush on my way to work was a hilarious adventure)

AustralianMakeup,3c1ybz,SizzlingVivacity,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:03:31 2015 UTC,I've bought essence at priceline and also at target
AustralianMakeup,3c1ybz,missprelude,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:28:26 2015 UTC,that actual blush though?
AustralianMakeup,3c1ybz,damn-croissants,3,Sat Jul 4 04:43:01 2015 UTC,I can't say I've seen it but I wasn't aware it exists before this thread though. But the essence racks are usually pretty full because people think the cheap price means cheap quality.  At least around here in Newcastle
AustralianMakeup,3c1ybz,missprelude,2,Sat Jul 4 05:06:03 2015 UTC,I have both the cool and warm tone Blush up Blushes and they are just phenomenal. Lovvvvvvveeee the warm one.
AustralianMakeup,3c1ybz,lush1984,2,Sat Jul 4 15:36:12 2015 UTC,I first discovered Essence when I forgot my makeup bag at home and had to run into Priceline to quickly buy a few things to get myself ready for an important meeting. I ended up buying whole bunch of great products for my whole face for just $20. The price difference is really a slap in the face to the massively marked up 'drugstore' brands.
AustralianMakeup,3c1ybz,IrmaGehrd,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:32:47 2015 UTC,"I discovered it when I refused to spend $19 on a mascara, instead I spent $5 and its the best mascara I've ever used. The eyeshadows are good too in the singles, i haven't tried the quads however though"
AustralianMakeup,3c1ybz,missprelude,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:37:09 2015 UTC,I had always just ignored them before just because I had terrible experiences from my youth trying those horrible $2 Store BYS type brands. I'm just glad they had testers.
AustralianMakeup,3c1ybz,IrmaGehrd,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:53:40 2015 UTC,embarrassingly i thought the same thing! thank god i've seen the light because essence is the bomb
AustralianMakeup,3c1ybz,damn-croissants,2,Sat Jul 4 05:20:24 2015 UTC,Their mascara is amazing. I currently use the Lash Mania Reloaded and it is amazing!
AustralianMakeup,3c1ybz,missprelude,2,Sat Jul 4 05:22:36 2015 UTC,i love their lip liners and eye liners - so so good and so so cheap!
AustralianMakeup,3c1ybz,damn-croissants,9,Sat Jul 4 05:31:51 2015 UTC,"Napoleon perdis brushes. With a few exceptions I can't tell the difference between them and cheap eBay finds.  Also, I second the MAC lipstick rip off. Madness.  Cheap products which impressed me are the $3 ELF brushes, Essence lip liners and NYX eyeshadows."
AustralianMakeup,3c1ybz,Teacupbunny,10,Sat Jul 4 03:43:42 2015 UTC,I have never understood the raves on Napoleon Perdis to be honest. I think most beauty media in Australia rave about it for no good reason - his products are passable.
AustralianMakeup,3c1ybz,pondicus,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:12:47 2015 UTC,"His products are good, but I've yet to try one that's amazing. The camera finish gold powder does make my skin look FLAWLESS for the first 4 hours, then it begins to cake :( the only thing I would repurchase is the Brush cleaner."
AustralianMakeup,3c1ybz,Kirena,2,Sat Jul 4 07:39:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's been my feel too. I don't mind his eyeshadows, but when you look at how affordable and great quality indies and other palettes like Chi Chi are - it's hard to justify his price point :("
AustralianMakeup,3c1ybz,pondicus,8,Sat Jul 4 08:07:58 2015 UTC,The prices on Physicians formula here are a joke. I remember bringing back mascaras and powers from the US that were around the $6 AUD mark each. Pretty much any mascara here in AUS is totally overpriced now that I think about it.   Essence mascara though? I just can't get enough! Love!
AustralianMakeup,3c1ybz,-SailorMoon-,4,Sat Jul 4 05:47:17 2015 UTC,"Quite a few people in this thread have raved about Essence, what would you recommend trying from them?"
AustralianMakeup,3c1ybz,Kirena,2,Sat Jul 4 07:32:04 2015 UTC,"Maximum Definition Mascara - its in a foil orange tube, I love this stuff. Sometimes too much mascara can come out on the brush, but I always wipe excess off before applying, this isnt a problem that's unique to this brand.   I also have all of their blushes. I find them all highly pigmented and long lasting.   I found the lipstick to be very meh in terms of lastability and pigmentation. Lastly I can't comment on their foundations as I've not tried any.. I have around 30 here that I'm trying to get through!"
AustralianMakeup,3c1ybz,-SailorMoon-,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:27:48 2015 UTC,"Definitely try out their eyeshadows, lipsticks, mascaras, some of the concealers and the cream to powder highlighter, skip the rest of the face products, especially if they're liquid formula."
AustralianMakeup,3c1ybz,louise_sophie,2,Sat Jul 4 09:26:36 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks! :D"
AustralianMakeup,3c1ybz,Kirena,6,Sat Jul 4 09:57:26 2015 UTC,"I want to say everything because right now I'm in the US and the prices are shocking. One thing I'll say is that Mecca frequently is reasonably priced, Urban Decay for example isn't very different."
AustralianMakeup,3c1ybz,ComingUpMilhouse,8,Sat Jul 4 16:43:36 2015 UTC,"Anything by By Terry at Mecca, especially their ombre black eyeshadow stick is AUD $58 for one eyeshadow colour - you can get decent palettes for that price! I can't imagine paying that much for an eyeshadow stick, when Asian beauty brands like Etude House do similar just as well and under AUD $10 online.   And don't get me started on Hourglass :/  On the positive side, I think Rimmel is a very affordable drugstore brand. Their mascaras are pretty sweet for what you pay for, especially when they have $10 eye product sales at Priceline."
AustralianMakeup,3c1ybz,pondicus,4,Sat Jul 4 07:11:20 2015 UTC,"Re By Terry - 100% this. Still mad that the Mecca chick convinced me to get their liner saying it was smudge proof. Shit smudges if you look at it, doesn't even last a few hours on me without giving me panda eyes. It's also incredibly soft and I have to sharpen it practically every time I use it. It's a massive fail."
AustralianMakeup,3c1ybz,starward-,1 point,Sun Jul 5 09:39:54 2015 UTC,Where are you able to get Etude house stuff online for that pricing? I only know of eBay :(
AustralianMakeup,3c1ybz,Stelare,2,Sat Jul 4 19:21:37 2015 UTC,Etude House's official store online ships internationally aka etudehouse.com. Otherwise you got Jolse.com and Roseroseshop.com too

AustralianMakeup,3c1ybz,pondicus,1 point,Sun Jul 5 08:05:54 2015 UTC,Ooh is it flat rate?
AustralianMakeup,3c1ybz,asteroyale,3,Sun Jul 5 08:17:54 2015 UTC,"Impressed me even though it was cheap: Essence gel eyeliner twist pencil thing  Not really a ""rip-off"" since it's very cheap, but it felt like a complete waste of money since I found it so bad: Essence felt tip eyeliner pen. Bought it hoping it would be like a cheaper version of the Maybelline Master Precise Liner pen but it's not. I found the formula too liquidy when applying and a bit went in my eyes and hurt - but then going over it again to achieve a nicer line rubbed away the previous strokes. Once it dried, it cracked and faded and was really short wearing. It was terrible in every way and I threw it away after wearing it just once."
AustralianMakeup,3c1ybz,teapottersparty,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:26:02 2015 UTC,"Did you then the 'thin' Essence liner? I had the same experience. I kept hearing so much good stuff about the Essence liners and assumed they would all be good - bad decision. The thin liner is horrendous and stains my skin, whereas the 'easy' liner is on par the Master Precise, if not better in some aspects."
AustralianMakeup,3c1ybz,IrmaGehrd,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:50:38 2015 UTC,"No, it was the regular one - this one: http://www.beautylab.nl/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/essence-eyeliner-pen.png   That's a bummer. I find Essence to be pretty hit and miss, and because they are very cheap, I don't mind it too much, but since I loved the gel liner so much I had high hopes for the pen liners. Alas, alack."
AustralianMakeup,3c1ybz,teapottersparty,2,Sun Jul 5 11:45:06 2015 UTC,"I am in America right now and whilst it's not $80 per brush, they're still like $USD30 per brush and there's no freaking way that I'm paying that. I have bought so many nail polishes from Marshalls though."

AustralianMakeup,3bzn7b,criti_biti,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:19:09 2015 UTC,Ah now is the perfect time to ask: how good are the BB/CC creams? Are they good on combo skin and won't cause any breakouts? Wear time etc.?  Thanks for the PSA by the way!
AustralianMakeup,3bzn7b,manicmoon,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:07:08 2015 UTC,"I have the BB in Medium-Tan, it's a little dark on my skin (NC30-35) and leans slightly orange but the CC equivalent is too pink toned. I find that even on my dry-combo skin it gets oily fairly quickly so you'll need to set it with powder for sure, but I really like the luminous/dewy finish. If you have a good colour match it looks lovely and skin-like :)"
AustralianMakeup,3bzn7b,wollywop,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:35:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the review! I might hold off on it then since my T-zone can get pretty oily, don't really want to make it even more so. :P"
AustralianMakeup,3bzn7b,manicmoon,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:21:40 2015 UTC,I tried the BB cream and it made me look so oily in a couple of hours. I would suggest anyone with oily or combination skin to stay away.

AustralianMakeup,3c0kz9,GassyButt,7,Fri Jul 3 17:51:29 2015 UTC,"Do Big W price match? Not sure how long the current Priceline sale is, but they've got 50% off Rimmel which might be a good way to pick up a few things.   What sort of products are you after? Eye makeup, face makeup, lip makeup? Is there anything you'd specifically like to replace?"
AustralianMakeup,3c0kz9,starward-,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:07:08 2015 UTC,"Not sure if big W price match but I will ask. I want foundation, blush and mascara first  so I can feel a little bit normal the rest I could probably order online and wait for."
AustralianMakeup,3c0kz9,starward-,2,Sat Jul 4 04:20:31 2015 UTC,"Mascara - Face of Australia Impact Curl. It's pretty cheap and works well IME.   Blush - I also like FOA's blushes but I am quite a blush noob. I remember someone doing a favourable review of the Boe (Big W brand) blushes - maybe it was /u/jamballdonut?   Foundation - the Rimmel Lasting Finish foundation with the white cap has gotten some good reviews, I'd check it out and see if they have your shade. Otherwise maybe just head your Big W and have a play with the testers to see if you like what they've got?"
AustralianMakeup,3c0kz9,jamballdonut,2,Sun Jul 5 10:14:57 2015 UTC,"I've only used one of the BOE Beauty blushes, and thought it was pretty decent for the price! Haven't tried any of the others, but they only had 2 and they looked way too similar for me, haha  In general, the BOE powders are actually pretty decent - The face powders set matte, but can get cakey, and I'm actually a really big fan of the bronzer I had by them.  The shimmer powder is also decent, but can be a bit powdery/chunky.  But, hey, for $2? Amazing quality!"
AustralianMakeup,3c0kz9,SizzlingVivacity,6,Sun Jul 5 10:50:51 2015 UTC,"I just moved into my boyfriend's place over the last 3 days and I wouldn't even let him carry my makeup from the car into the house. I refused to seal the box as well and when I moved it, I did one whole trip (30minutes round) purely for my makeup and it sat in the front seat with me. I may be a little bit too attached to my makeup, but whatevs. If this had happened to me I'd have cried my eyes out.  On a more helpful note, Strawberrynet is a great place to pick up any items you can be bothered waiting for in the post. They've never taken very long to get to me and they offer so many discounts to their already lower than retail prices. They add 5% discount just for buying more than one thing at a time and each time you purchase from them, your standing discount on every order goes up 1% (Second order is 1% off, 3rd order is 2% off etc etc up to 10%). It's my favourite makeup website and if they don't stock something you want, you can email them and they'll do their best to get the product in or explain why they can't. Also all the shipping is free."

AustralianMakeup,3c0kz9,hez_lea,2,Sat Jul 4 04:22:19 2015 UTC,Well if you break it down here's what basics I'd get at my big w if that happened to me (don't know what the range at that big w is though).  Base: revlon colorstay dry/normal is really versatile if you have a beauty blender/real tech sponge. Or you could try the garnier bb cream (oil free one is liquid similar to foundations) for something cheaper but the shades suck. A lot of people also love loreal true match but it didn't work on my textured skin.  Maybelline fit me concealers are awesome for both under eyes and spot concealing   Powder: Australis is available at mine so their fresh and flawless pressed powder. Or maybelline fit me or rimmel stay matte.  Blush: max factor's new baked blushes. Bronzer you can either get rimmel natural bronzer or the loreal true match face powders in a darker shade.  Mascara: cover girl or maybelline are popular (maybelline dry/irritate my eyes so I switched to cover girls mascara in the orange tube)
AustralianMakeup,3c0kz9,Rocha_999,2,Sat Jul 4 13:44:00 2015 UTC,If you have Coles/woolworths check out what is on sale at yours each week. You can normally get rimmel and maybelline depending on the store. One of mine has covergirl too. What did you have before that has been broken?
AustralianMakeup,3bxcke,burnt_can,6,Thu Jul 2 22:48:45 2015 UTC,Ah! So jealous.   I really wanted to order but I can't justify buying anything from the US with this exchange rate.   Those foiled shadows just look so so intense in that second photo!
AustralianMakeup,3bxcke,alyss0r,4,Thu Jul 2 23:44:15 2015 UTC,This is the reason why I couldn't justify it - the exchange is so so horrible at the moment!
AustralianMakeup,3bxcke,Jessijames,2,Fri Jul 3 00:23:43 2015 UTC,I mean the shadows themselves still aren't that expensive but the palettes are and they add up quickly. If I had disposable income I probably would have jumped on the opportunity!
AustralianMakeup,3bxcke,alyss0r,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:06:59 2015 UTC,Definitely! Shadows are the one thing I am trying to build a reasonable yet conservative collection of that actually get used - not having endless amounts of shadows I can barely get around to touching with a brush and so I feel a bit glad I didn't go nuts a buy a bunch of these haha
AustralianMakeup,3bxcke,Jessijames,2,Fri Jul 3 06:19:51 2015 UTC,"I really wanted to order but I can't justify buying anything from the US with this exchange rate.   Agreed!

AustralianMakeup,3bxcke,badassbettie,3,Fri Jul 3 01:48:21 2015 UTC,"It adds up to be so much, even though it's only like $8 a shadow. Plus I need a palette to put them in which are expensive :(  Daaaamn gurl that's a lot of MAC hahaha. I am impressed/concerned/jealous all at once."

AustralianMakeup,3bxf1d,Jessijames,6,Thu Jul 2 23:09:47 2015 UTC,"Not a mid-high end, but I use the Covergirl Clump Crusher (the lash extension one) and that works well for me :) the short rubber bristles separate all my lashes, and it gives a nice lengthened look.  Unless you can get a sample first, buying mid-high end may be a risk for you if you have particular needs from a mascara - if it doesn't work, that's a whole lot of money down the drain."
AustralianMakeup,3bxf1d,lyzaw,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:07:14 2015 UTC,"I have heard so many great things about the clump crusher from CG and I tried it a little while back but found it really sticky (does that even make sense? lol) like all day long my lashes felt tacky against one another!   I'm not super fussed on the risk factor, I plan on going and trying it out at the place (Mecca, or whichever counter) beforehand to see how it goes for me!  The way I see it, most brands don't have available sample sizes for mascaras anyway - so anyone buying anything outside of drugstore is taking that risk regardless when it comes to mascara, right? Plus, I am happy to spend the money at the moment - Tax-time splurge haha"
AustralianMakeup,3bxf1d,Liraniel,2,Fri Jul 3 00:18:17 2015 UTC,Wipe most of the product off on a square of TP first. That leaves enough on the brush for an almost sheer coat. Then it shouldn't feel too tacky. (I use the original clump crusher)
AustralianMakeup,3bxf1d,lyzaw,1 point,Fri Jul 3 11:51:42 2015 UTC,That's fair enough! I'm just personally a huge tightass and really try to find cheaper products to work for me before I splurge  (mostly because I don't have much money). Good luck!
AustralianMakeup,3bxf1d,pumpkinspicevodka,3,Fri Jul 3 02:54:03 2015 UTC,"Have you tried Rollerlash yet? I have really unruly lashes and this separates and coats them individually and makes them look really long.

AustralianMakeup,3bxf1d,pumpkinspicevodka,2,Fri Jul 3 00:20:56 2015 UTC,Can second roller lash. It's worth the ~$40. I have eyelashes that sit low (not really curled) and I have found this makes my lashes sit up and they hold all day (eg. 7am-7pm kinda thing.) it's pretty waterproof but I can remove it easily enough in the shower with warm water and sometimes I use coconut oil before the shower to get it moving. I was using the L'oreal (I think) butterfly false lashes one before this.
AustralianMakeup,3bxf1d,skunkybooms,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:34:08 2015 UTC,No worries! I hated They're Real as well - I tried Roller Lash twice in store and a sample at home before deciding to buy it. Benefit can be really hit and miss.

AustralianMakeup,3bxf1d,onehungrydinosaur,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:12:43 2015 UTC,I don't think it's labeled as waterproof but I find it stays put better than a lot of waterproof mascaras I have. The only thing you might find with shorter lashes is that it could be difficult to rotate/roll the wand properly - but I use it with an eyelash curler and without rotating the wand when I'm in a rush and it still holds really well :)

AustralianMakeup,3bxf1d,continuousline,2,Sat Jul 4 01:01:09 2015 UTC,There is a Roller Lash sample/travel size you can get. I haven't tested mine out just yet.   I did buy the Theyre Real Mascara full size but all the negative reviews makes me hesitant to try it.   But the one I'm liking atm is the Maybelline  Cat Eye in waterproof.

AustralianMakeup,3bxf1d,WarlockPanda,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:57:41 2015 UTC,"Still looking for a good one myself but throwing it out there I do NOT recommend Stila - Stay all day mascara.  First off, the best brush I've ever used. But the mascara itself takes forever to dry. I have super long eyelashes, so it's constantly hitting my under eyes and above my crease leaving little black marks."
AustralianMakeup,3bxf1d,WarlockPanda,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:38:12 2015 UTC,"EL Sumptuous Infinite Daring Length + Volume Mascara Loreal Voluminous Carbon Black Lancome Hypnose Drama MaxFactor Masterpiece (this one wasn't much for volume but for definition. It doesn't do much to the lashes but makes them really black and stand out more.)  I do want to say that my lashes aren't that bad, they are long and bit curled but the first three mascaras do such an amazing job on my lashes that I want to recommend it to everyone. Doesn't clump up my lashes (in fact, I use the EL mascara on top if some other mascara I used has clumped up my lashes. And it makes everything better!). Sometimes even my boyfriend asks me if I'm wearing false lashes (on a good lash day) when I'm just wearing one of the first three ones."
AustralianMakeup,3bxf1d,WarlockPanda,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:39:10 2015 UTC,I'm tempted to try that essence mascara.   My personal favourite is Smashbox full exposure mascara. I got a sample size in a trial kit. I loved it so much I bought the full size. The only one I like more is Maxi Lash from Guerlain. But I feel they are quite similar in terms of formula and the Smashbox one has a better wand and is less expensive. Once I work through all the mascaras in my stash I would see myself buying it again.   I do remember a great blog that showed what 50 different mascaras looked like on a persons eye but I can't seem to find it.
AustralianMakeup,3bxf1d,DarkPhoenix1993,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:57:27 2015 UTC,"Smashbox full exposure mascara   Interesting, I tend to go for rubbery wands over the fibre style as I feel like they're better at separating my lashes but this one looks quite thin. How do you find it with regards to clumping etc?"
AustralianMakeup,3bxf1d,c1v3t,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:00:19 2015 UTC,I only had clumping issues when it was starting to turn bad after 6ish months. I find that the wand is actually good for separating the lashes. It gives more length than volume. I wish they sold mini tubes. :(

AustralianMakeup,3bxf1d,starla_,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:24:35 2015 UTC,I think technique is very important when applying mascara. I place the sand near the base of my lashes and move upwards in a wiggling motion. It helps avoid clumps
AustralianMakeup,3bxf1d,Tonkie,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:26:52 2015 UTC,I love the Clinique mascaras. The regular one and the one in the light blue tube - can't get to them otherwise I'd have names :P - are my favourites. Especially the one in the light blue tube - it's got a small brush which separates and coats my lashes really well. Sadly Clump Crusher and all Covergirl/Max Factor products make my eyes water horribly and my skin break out :-(
AustralianMakeup,3bxf1d,SchultzAL,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:10:37 2015 UTC,"You might like the Too Faced Better Than Sex mascara! It's available at Mecca and it is advertised as a volumising and lengthening mascara but I find that the wand has so many bristles, it's awesome for separating and defining my lashes. It's definitely my holy grail mascara. Just make sure that when you take the wand out of the tube, you give it a good scrape along the sides to get rid of any excess product that might make your lashes appear clumpy!"

AustralianMakeup,3bxszb,kianabeauty,5,Fri Jul 3 01:14:12 2015 UTC,"My skin is stupid dry-sensitive, so my morning routine is normally:   Snail essence mixed with matte cream moisturiser (shea-mango butter based) Sunscreen Wait 5 min for it to soak in aka I normally use this time to change for work Primer Foundation applied with fingers Concealer patted with fingers Powder to set concealer using a flat brush leftover from a powder compact Powder highlighter Blush Brows Eyes   This sounds like a lot, but it normally takes 10 min all up from the primer step. Moisturising is so important for me, because I tend to get eczema flare-ups on my cheeks - winter makes it worse, so my PM routine is all about moisture layers.  Edit - the snail essence sounds gross, but /r/AsianBeauty has shown it definitely works for me personally. Mixing it in with my moisturiser in the morning gives it an extra kick of moisture and reduces redness for me.  My sunscreen is also running out/expiring soon, so I bought Mecca's new SPF 50+ facial sunscreen last night. It's a super lovely moussey texture and contains hyaluronic acid (which is a humectant) to help my dumb skin retain moisture. So expensive, but I'm going to use it as my primer step as well."

AustralianMakeup,3bxszb,peachpeony,2,Fri Jul 3 03:02:00 2015 UTC,"Dry patches sounds like you need a moisturiser with ceramides to help keep the moisture in! I always use moisturiser first and a cream/mousse-like primer on top. I've tried:   Napoleon Perdis Autopilot - did nothing for me, clogged my pores :( Face of Australia Face Base primer - purple bottle, did nothing for me. My skin didn't like this at all. Benefit Porefessional - ehhh, I like the semi-solid texture but I don't think it made my face last longer. Hourglass Mineral Veil - was my HG for a while, kept my makeup in place. Then one day my skin was all, ""lol have a pimple. Have a few more."" Sigh. Too Faced Primed and Poreless - my current HG. Feels very moisturising, but not oily. It keeps my face on well, but not as long as Mineral Veil. Urban Decay Pore Perfecting Complexion Primer Potion - very nourishing like it says, but it wasn't as semi-matte as I liked Too Faced's one. Fyrinnae Powder Primer - literally what it says. I had a sample of this and didn't like it much personally, but it's worked amazingly for others. Didn't feel like it did anything except act as a powder.   I've also used a finishing powder on top of my super moisturised face as a ""primer"" aka the Wayne Goss foundation method and this has worked well to keep my face on. I think this is most effective with powders that are high in silica content, like Australis Ready Set Go and Shiro's Finishing Move powder, but it depends on your preference."
AustralianMakeup,3bxszb,pondicus,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:32:07 2015 UTC,"I've been using dr. jart ceramidin cream for a month and it does help eliminate my dry patches, but because my skin is super dry and dehydrated, the dry patches come and go from time to time :(  I heard a lot of good reviews for the Hourglass Mineral Veil, but I tried to restrain myself to not buy it because the price is kinda high if it doesn't work on my skin.. so I wanted to find a cheaper alternative first before I take the plunge :) Another primer that I'm curious of is the smashbox hydrating primer, I wonder if it's really hydrating and can help conceal the fine lines.. My main concern is the fine lines, cause it makes me look a lot older than I actually am :("
AustralianMakeup,3bxszb,peachpeony,2,Fri Jul 3 12:13:05 2015 UTC,"Do you use sunscreen? I found sunscreen helped more than I expected it to - the Aussie sun can sometimes be the culprit for fine lines :(  Maybe your skin could do with some extra benefits? I don't know if it will work for you (please check with your doctor or dermatologist!) - but my doctor recommended me to take Vitamin D capsules, because my levels were really low, plus drink water and eat fatty acids like leafy greens and such (see this Harvard nutrition study on omega-3s). I use an app on my phone to remind me to drink 2.4 litres of water a day. If your skin is dehydrated, maybe water and lots of moisture layers might help...?  The girls at Mecca told me Mineral Veil is good for oily skin, but might not be great for us dry skin folks. Maybe see if you can go in and grab samples of that and the Urban Decay one if you can? The Urban Decay one was the most moisturising for me out of all the primers I've tried.  Good luck on your search! :))"

I've hated Neutrogena, Cancer Council and Banana Boat personally - good for body, not for face :(  If you're after a cheaper option, then maybe look into Asian sunscreens? Innisfree Eco Safety SPF50+ Sunblock is really good along with Biore Watery Essence (contains alcohol though, so can be pretty drying). /r/AsianBeauty might be useful for some initial research too."

I've been hanging out in /r/AsianBeauty too, my Rakuten order finally arrived yesterday. I ordered Curel sunblock and skin aqua UV moisture milk.

I assume vaseline would work the same. I should stress that i only put the paw paw over the fine lines, and not anywhere else on my face; i assume i would get pimples if i used it everywhere.   But it works to keep the wrinkles puffed out for about 12 hours."

Whereas in Summer I use a setting spray every day.   The only thing I do different skincare wise is use extra moisturiser. Over summer I use a lighter type, over Winter I use something a little heavier at least at night and it seems to be improving my skin's overall texture during Winter!"

AustralianMakeup,3bxszb,starward-,2,Fri Jul 3 07:04:03 2015 UTC,"I'm generally combination oily, but this winter I've become so dry, and also my skin tone is a lot lighter than in summer (I go from NC45 in the middle of summer to about NC35 in the middle of winter).   Lately I've swap out my Garnier Moisture Matte moisturiser for St Ive's Timeless Skin moisturiser. I find that the moisturiser change has really helped my skin feel hydrated and I don't have any dry spots (like I did before I change).   I've also changed my foundation routine from the Goss method to just applying the foundation normally (stippled on moisture do skin) because I've found that I'm no where near as oily - which is good because I've just found out that my holy grail pressed powder has been discontinued. I'm still using Revlon Colour Stay for combo to oily skin which is somehow looking nice on my drier skin.   I usually apply my moisturiser and then do my eyes so it has a bit of time to sink in, before applying my foundation and the rest of my face (powder blush and contour). I tried my bareminerals powder foundation (which is a better match for my skin tone in winter) yesterday but it made my dry skin look like leather, so I'm sticking with liquid even if it's a little dark."
AustralianMakeup,3bxszb,iammay,2,Fri Jul 3 04:05:24 2015 UTC,"Mine doesn't change too much. The biggest change it not doing the Goss method in winter. I find I tend to moisturise twice at night after my exfoliant, firstly with a light moisturizer then with Cetaphil in the tub. If I have any problems with dry patches that I notice, I toss on a bit of papaw ointment focused on the spots only, usually on the sides of the mouth, around my nose and sometimes on my eyelids. When it comes to makeup I tend to use setting powder on my nose and forehead only in winter and avoid the cheeks because they start to look too dry with powder. I prefer a lighter coverage foundation or BB cream in winter because I don't feel like I will sweat it off easily."

Although I only have 4, 2 of them are quite dark and ""wintery"" so I've been loving them mixed with a light gold shade to add some light to my eyes Little bit of eyeliner - Either pencil if I'm feeling extra smokey, or liquid if I'm feeling like putting in that extra effort.  Or, I've been loving my MAC Fluidline in Feeling Good, which is the most beautiful maroon shade with glitter through it.  Then, I curl my lashes (which really does nothing, because my lashes are stubborn as poop), then apply a coat or two of mascara to make it look like I actually have lashes Then, put on some more moisturiser (A different one), and a face primer, and let them set Eyebrow time! My eyebrows either take 5 seconds or 5 hours, no in between.  I used LOVE the Savvy Brow Kit, but it just HAS NOT been working lately, so I've been using my Anastasia Brow Wiz instead and loving that. Then, all my face stuff has sunk in, so I use my Revlon Nearly Naked foundation, applied with a damp Beauty Blender, if my skin is playing nice.  If it's not, I only use concealer where it ABSOLUTELY  necessary (Chin blemishes, nose blemishes, and some under my eyes) and blend it out with a fluffy brush, then my fingers.  Then, the tiniest amount of Rimmel Stay Matte powder, so it doesn't all crease and rub away If my skin was playing nice, and I did foundation, etc. I'll go in with the bronzer in the Urban Decay Flushed palette (I find it works really nice on my pale skin), then my Savvy Classic Blush in Plum (Perfect winter shade, and it's a really nice matte, deep shade), then a bit of highlighter (Typically the gold Inglot shade so I can do some matchy matchy) Then lip time! I'm super dooper lazy with doing lipstick, since it just rubs off anyway, so my go-to has just been lip balm (I've also been sick since the start of winter, so my lips have been super dry anyway and lip balm is really all they can take) Then, to finish it all off, I go in with my Victoria's Secret setting spray (Mostly because I hate it, and just want to finish it already ahha)   then, that's done!

Touch ups were no problem, so it wasn't a deal breaker for me. I didn't have problems with feathering or slipping, as long as I let it dry properly.  Seconding other posters' comments on the lipsticks. Really great formula, especially the red matte tubes. Lovely colours, apply smoothly and evenly, and are relatively long lasting. Really comfortable on, and as non-drying as a matte lipstick can be."
AustralianMakeup,3bubeo,cowboy_dog,6,Thu Jul 2 12:25:39 2015 UTC,Provocalips liquid lipsticks. I have 'play with fire' and 'kiss me you fool' but with this sale I'll probably pick up at least one more. They last for a very long time and are very comfortable.
AustralianMakeup,3bubeo,xenomorphic_acid,2,Thu Jul 2 06:23:49 2015 UTC,How do they fare when eating? do they fade off or go off in flakes?
AustralianMakeup,3bubeo,gospursgo_,2,Thu Jul 2 07:46:39 2015 UTC,"With most foods they don't budge, but anything really oily it comes off in small flakes in the centre. You can reduce the chances of that by reapplying the clear gloss right before eating. :)"
AustralianMakeup,3bubeo,szarkasm,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:51:53 2015 UTC,"I can't decide which one I want next, I have the two reds and the bright pink and the nude pink (which isn't on par with the rest). The dark red is my all time fave lip product I think!!"
AustralianMakeup,3bubeo,xenomorphic_acid,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:21:24 2015 UTC,"Really. How do you wear them? I find even with applying the balm side or a lip balm on top, they dry my lips out horribly by the end of the day. I was left in public with flaky empty spots in the middle of my lip. When I tried to reapply, the exact same thing happened. How do you get it to stay on?"
AustralianMakeup,3bubeo,cherrybun,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:18:24 2015 UTC,"With any lip product, I usually apply lip balm and then wipe it off a few minutes later. I apply the colour in two thin layers, then once it's dry use the clear gloss. Depending on what I'm doing throughout the day, I'll apply the clear gloss over the top again (before eating messy food usually) but any other balm or gloss breaks down the colour. During redmylips I wore provocalips most days of the month, so my lips did get dry, I just made sure I used lanolips overnight to keep them from drying out."
AustralianMakeup,3bubeo,jamballdonut,3,Fri Jul 3 02:57:45 2015 UTC,"Rimmel has to be my all-time favourite 'drugstore' brand. It can do no wrong in my eyes, apart from the lack of a pale neutral/yellow foundation.  I've been using the stay matte powder religiously for 6 years. My other favourites are the exaggerate liquid eyeliner, the apocalips liquid lipstick, kate moss lipsticks and those long-lasting ones with two ends although I have to be super careful when applying them."

AustralianMakeup,3bubeo,paradoxgirl44,5,Thu Jul 2 09:53:58 2015 UTC,"Nobody's mentioned the Wake Me Up foundation which I'm surprised by. It's got teeny little glitters (which they call ""light reflective particles"") which make it look really dewy and fresh, if you're not into matte finishes I'd recommend it. I have very dry skin and it sometimes cakes up a bit, but with a primer it looks great."

AustralianMakeup,3bubeo,toasty_feet,4,Sat Jul 4 10:11:44 2015 UTC,The scandeleyes pencil eyeliner in Taupe- that particular liner is awesome. Awesome for the bottom lash line without looking too harsh and pandery and it's the only thing I have found so far where I can fill in my brows without looking like I used Burt and Ernie for inspiration.
AustralianMakeup,3bubeo,SchultzAL,3,Thu Jul 2 14:38:02 2015 UTC,"GlamEyes liquid liner is my HG. I've had mine far too long, and it hasn't run out or dried out. It's not so liquidy that it drips / flicks droplets (like some of my others) and it's easy to remove with some foundation when it's dry, if you make a mistake."

Their eyeshadow quads are really good too. I think they're called glam eyes? I have three of them and I've been really impressed with the colour payoff and wear time. Gel eyeliner.

AustralianMakeup,3bubeo,joulia09,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:06:44 2015 UTC,"Their matte lipsticks (I have 106 107 110 and 111) - favourite matte formula ever. 106 is one of the first non-nude lipsticks I bought. 107 is amazing, all I can say. 110 is in that corally shade range that I'm obsessed with and always impulse buy even though I have way too many corals now. Aaaaand 111 was a flop for me - it's a very yellow red that really doesn't look good on me, but the formula is still up there with the rest!  Match Perfection loose powder is my daily t-zone setting powder. I hated Stay Matte, SO cakey and separates all my foundations - whereas the MP loose powder doesn't cake and just sits perfectly on my skin.   And the Lash Accelerator mascara (shiny yellow tube) is SO lengthening. The brush combs my lashes beautifully too. Maybelline falsies mascara for glorious clumpy volume, followed by this mascara to comb out the clumps and lengthen... HNNG, lash perfection."
AustralianMakeup,3bubeo,paradoxgirl44,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:24:37 2015 UTC,if you are into them the exaggerate lip liners are really nice - kate moss matte lipsticks  - provocalips are great for a super long wearing lip - make your move is my favourite shade - the new lasting perfection nude foundation (white cap) great medium coverage that has a satin finish

If anyone try the jumbo eyeliner before please let me know I am interested to know your opinion.
AustralianMakeup,3bubeo,prettyreckless11,1 point,Fri Jul 3 09:14:07 2015 UTC,Their lip liners are very good. I have one in Eastend Snob and it's one of my favourite ever lip colours!
AustralianMakeup,3bun4p,pixiie3,11,Thu Jul 2 07:57:38 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to say, a lot of the time there's no one ""right"" answer for makeup. You can wear concealer under or over foundation for example. Its all preference, choice in products, and what works best for you. Sometimes people prefer one way over another but I mean, people can do whatever they want. I would do lots of research and watch videos to help you, then ask specific, pointed questions here or wherever if you have something in particular you don't understand. But everyone owns different types of products in different finishes and uses them in different ways in different orders. So you just gotta experiment and what works best for you!  I think looking on Temptalia is a great recommendation, as well as makeupalley and any blogs you fancy. Hope you enjoy! It's the best fun and there's a lot to learn :)"

AustralianMakeup,3bun4p,assaulted_peanuts,2,Thu Jul 2 22:29:12 2015 UTC,"For me it was all about trial and error. I kept seeing make up tutorials where the girls would use a cream high lighter and a cream contour, and their make up would come out looking flawless. When I tried it, it would cake during the day or just not stand out as much as theirs, Even though I was using the same products.  No I use a powder High lighter and powder contour and it works a dream on me. Never cakes and is really noticeable.   I know its hard not to spend heaps of money, but you can get testers from places like MECCA and MAC."

AustralianMakeup,3bqlfa,RedundantMumma,6,Wed Jul 1 10:22:30 2015 UTC,"Makeup necessities are always subjective. Here's my suggestions for makeup:   Neutral eyeshadow palette -- dark shadows for smoky eye, the lighter shadows for an appropriate work look. At the very least, you could get a neutral colour that matches your skintone and a darker brown for a very basic eyeshadow look -- for an example, look at NARS Portbello or Kalahari. Red lipstick -- instant glamour for night and dressier occasions. Choose the red that you intuitively gravitate towards. Blush - either basic pink or apricot, depending on your skintone. I'm sure an SA could help you to find a blush that looks most natural on you. If you find that you don't want any blush, that is okay. Cream blushes are easier to blend with your fingers but you'll need a good blush brush for powder. I generally think you should look at mid-range for cream blushes but for powder, you can find good ones in the pharmacy.   As for the tools:   Shader brush: You got to have this as your basic eyeshadow brush. Blending brush: Again, this is a necessity for good eyeshadow looks. Pencil brush: Good for obtaining a smoky look under the eye, or applying shadow precisely against the crease. Blush brush (if you opt for powder): get a chubby one that's domed at the end. To find a good brush, hold the handle (like you hold a pencil) -- it should feel solid and balanced in the hand. Run your fingers through the bristles and it should have a little ""bounce"" like it's got a bit of resistance. Scratchy bristles aren't ideal but if your budget only gets you so far, it's ok... but I'd reserve more money on brushes than makeup.    I don't think bronzer and highlighters are necessities but they are good to have if you like to add a little bit of definition on your face and give colour to your face."
AustralianMakeup,3bqlfa,StrattonLove,6,Wed Jul 1 11:48:45 2015 UTC,"A fellow FNQ here and I feel your pain, but I'd get  Definitely a neutral eye-shadow palette: I like the Neutral and the Bronze palettes from ChiChi ($19.95 from Target or Myer) Lots of shadows to play around with and find your look.  Brushes: The elf ones are hit and miss but for $3 the white handled 'defining eye brush' has held up pretty well, same with the 'blending eye brush' ($3.00 at Kmart) For other brushes Real techniques has some great ones but instead of buying them on your trip in Brisbane I would get them off iherb for a far better price but if you do want to have a look at them they stock the range at priceline.  Concealer: If you want concealer to hide late nights I really like Maybelline's fit me concealer, but it seems to be a bit of a personal preference thing you either love it or hate it.  Lip stuff: I'd stick with tinted lip balm or a gloss up there (lipstick occasionally can melt and be annoying in the heat) and lipstick is one of those things where you generally will reapply it throughout the day so it has to stay on you at all times. I'd rather have something that won't melt into the lid every time the air con in the car won't kick in (it shouldn't but you never know). For work I'd find a ""your lips but better"" colour to start of with. (Don't be afraid to ask the assistant if you go to a place like priceline- it took me ages to figure out salmon pinks are not a nude on me, that instead I had to look at red-browns)  Bronzers/Blushes: I was always overheating and red so when I gather my makeup basics I tend to grab bronzer over blush, it's a personal preference though.  Highlighters: Eyeshadow can double as highlighter if you really want to use it so I wouldn't worry too much about that kind of thing.   Setting powder: I found I need a setting powder to keep everything from melting off my face (but i am oily and living in the tropics) and I like the ""fresh and flawless pressed powder"" from Australis ($11.95 at Priceline)  Now for tips:  Take wet ones with you when you shop! Priceline has tissues at about calf height under the makeup displays. Trust me- you will need them if you want to swatch things like lip products and eyeliners.  If you find anything that you fancy the colour of but don't know how to use or if it's really worth it, take a photo of the colour name so you can look it up online later on (or ask us about it).  (Similar note) The makeupalley app is your friend instore- I have gone to buy many things and then stopped because I quickly checked the online reviews.  If you can't get everything this trip and you go to Townsville or Cairns at other times of the year there are Pricelines, Chemist Warehouses, Targets and Myers in both.  Hope that helped!"
AustralianMakeup,3bqlfa,Sandpaper_Kiss,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:37:11 2015 UTC,"Yes! The two $3 elf brushes you mentioned are my absolute favourite, I reach for these instead of some of my $30 and $40 brushes!"
AustralianMakeup,3bqlfa,Teacupbunny,4,Fri Jul 3 08:56:05 2015 UTC,"So it sounds like your priorities are a) price, b) functionality, and c) simplicity. I've tried to keep this as easy to approach as possible, as I feel that with some exposure you'll feel more comfortable doing your shopping and continue to 'expand' your beauty repertoire. With that in mind, here's what I got:     Do you get oily? If so, consider using a powder over your foundation, or just to touch up excessively oily areas over the course of the day. Rimmel Stay Matte Powder is a popular option. It's compact and easy to take around with you - just buy one of those Manicare flat powder puff things and throw one into the container and just pat your face as required; a little bit goes a long way. Do you want to add 'dimension' to your face? Many people consider a face with only foundation to be a bit 'flat'. Blushes, bronzers, and highlighters tend to this issue in different ways. In the interest of simplicity, Maybelline's Master Hi-Light is basically a blend of all three -- just grab a brush (or the second flat powder puff thing that comes in the packet), lightly tap it in the product, and then pat/blend it onto the tops of your cheeks. That'll give you the 'pop' you need without bogging you down with too many products. Do you want colour on your eyelids? You'll want to invest in at least a fluffy eyeshadow brush (often called blending brushes) in order to blend product onto your eye. Essence do a number of eyeshadow duos which are worth looking at -- a 'simple' eyeshadow look generally involves one colour on the moving part of the eyelid, and one colour blended into the 'crease' -- that top edge where the skin underneath your eyebrow meets the protruding curve of the eyeball.  How do you feel about lip colour? If you want to start small, go for a tinted lip balm - Burts Bees has a number of them in various colours. Maybelline has a wide range of lipstick colours to suit most needs as well. The Revlon Balm Stains are also a popular choice if you like the jumbo stick type application.   All of these things are available at a Priceline which (I assume?) is easier for you to get to in general. Many of these brands you can also find at a Big W/Target. Priceline also has a 40% off makeup a couple times a year, so if money is a concern then it could be worthwhile to wait for that to come along."
AustralianMakeup,3bqlfa,Nikaa,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:14:29 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much, I had actually looked at the Maybelline Master Hi-Light, I'll go back tomorrow and get it to try it out. And yes I'd like to wear colour on my lips but feel silly going from nothing to lipstick all of a sudden, I think tinted lip balm is the perfect starting block for me."
AustralianMakeup,3bqlfa,hez_lea,3,Thu Jul 2 05:52:28 2015 UTC,"I love my Lorac pocket pro. I got mine with one of their kits but you can buy a similar one separate for $15USD if you or one of your friends is doing an Amazon order it might be worth adding to the order. It's only 3 eye shadows but they go together so you know what ever eye look you come out with will be awesome and it's fab for traveling.   For eyeshadow definitely get a blending brush. If I could only have one it's what I would get. You will never get a precise look with it but it will always be a polished one.   The MAC 9 times eyeshadow compacts are interesting. I have 3 and they were my first MAC purchase. I don't love all the shadows in them but it's easy to get a few looks out of each palette because the colours are reasonably co-ordinated. I still prefer my Lorac shadows (I think I just like soft shadows) but I think they were a good first MAC purchase. People were a bit annoyed when they came out because I think from the pictures people expected them to be full size shadows and it would be some AMAZING bargain. Personally I'm glad they are not full size, I know I'm not going to use them up as it is.   If your venturing into eyeshadow though, you might need eyeshadow primer. That discovery changed my life, makes even cheap shadows look amazing and stay in place. I use the NARS smudge proof, then if I was a coloured base like a colour tattoo i still put the NARS underneath. If you have to, borrow some eyeshadow from someone before you head down to Brisbane and find out if your going to someone who's eyeshadow creases - then you will know if eye primer is it's a need or not."
AustralianMakeup,3bqlfa,jazree,2,Thu Jul 2 21:47:17 2015 UTC,"My recommendation would be to hit up the big Mecca store in Brissy, and ask the ladies there for some help. They are so friendly and helpful.  I've always been able to find what I'm looking for that way even starting with super vague descriptions for things like lipstick colours. You gotta be brave and ask though!"

AustralianMakeup,3bqlfa,prettyreckless11,2,Thu Jul 2 05:57:05 2015 UTC,"Here's my could not live without organised into face bits:  Skin  Australis foundation/powder/concealer all in one. - I can vary and use concealer, foundation and powder separately but honestly this really rocks. It blends well and it's really simple.  Blush - I use a powder which at the moment is from an NYX set.   Eyebrows  Tweezers! Yeah they'll change your life as long as you don't go crazy and end up looking like you're in the 90's.   Australis Oh Hai Brow set (tweezers suck in this but the rest is good). It even has a quickie instruction guide.   Eyes  Eyeliner options are a must! A good liquid eyeliner pen makes things very simple. The next step up from that is a little pot of black gel eyeliner (such as Maybelline) and a good angled brush (so far the ones that come with them have not been great. ELF makes a good brush for under $10 that you can buy at K Mart.  Eyeshadows - you cannot do without a basic palette of shadows! You simply must have some options. Whether you build them individually or you buy in bulk you absolutely have to be able to create depth and light on your lids. You need dark through light in varying shades. You might want to start with a basic cost efficient NYX palette that you can grab at Target and then go from there.   Mascara - gotta have a go-to deep black. I'm using a Maybelline one at the moment but will switch up when I get around to it.  Lips  Some neutral beige shades that work with your skin tone, a few pinks and at least one bright colour that makes you feel daring. If you can find that you'll have a good few options. NYX does some very nice matte lip cremes that I can't recommend highly enough. Australis has velour lips that have so much colour and Chi Chi has a very rich matte lipstick that I intend to expand my collection into other colours. Just avoid Chi Chi glosses I would probably say after being very disappointed recently.  There's a lot more I could add but these are some basics that will more than get you started. You can get a lot of your shopping needs dealt with in K Mart, Target and Priceline. So nothing too extravagent at the basic stages. Just remember to take it slowly and build your knowledge as you branch out."

AustralianMakeup,3bqlfa,Artemisian11,2,Thu Jul 2 05:56:27 2015 UTC,"I would say try buying some Essence products, you can buy online from Priceline. They are cheap and good quality and the range isnt overwhelming large. Favourites of mine include the lip liners (very creamy, can apply all over your lips), the blushes and the eyeshadows. Maybe watch some youtube makeup videos with girls that look simular to you (eye colour, hair colour, skin type, complexion) and see what products and colours they use. Make up is fun but overwhelming. I suggest investing in a makeup palette ($50) that way you have a few colours to try on and they last forever. If lipstick if overwhelming to try and pick a colour and apply it perfectly try a lip stain with gloss over the top. For example try the Revlon lip crayons, they glide on your lips, add colour but are so easier to apply than lipstick."

AustralianMakeup,3bpufl,Elizsabeth,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:48:26 2015 UTC,"They might be us sizes. The U.S. Cup size is different to the aus size, they also seem to use more random sizes. But with international recipes being so easy to access now it can be worth having sets from other countries. It rarely makes a difference though unless it's something fussy like pasta or bread."

AustralianMakeup,3bpufl,bootymcowlface,2,Wed Jul 1 04:56:49 2015 UTC,"They're awesome. I've used them a few times, mostly for skincare, and my friend in NZ has used them for vitamins and protein bars. I'm always happy with the products and postage (both in pricing and how quickly the parcel arrives). I would definitely recommend using them. You should be able to find a discount code online, as well - sometimes it can end up giving you enough off that postage ends up being free!"

AustralianMakeup,3bpufl,IronicallyNamedCat,2,Wed Jul 1 09:13:03 2015 UTC,Definitely legit. Bought from them twice now with absolutely no issues!
AustralianMakeup,3bpufl,manicmoon,2,Wed Jul 1 10:34:09 2015 UTC,They are awesome at iherb. I bought some coconut oil which leaked (they had it in a ziplock bag anyway) and I lost a small amount. They refunded me for it within a couple of days of me emailing them. Also bought RT brushes from them and they were authentic!

AustralianMakeup,3bm79u,Lucy_Fury,5,Tue Jun 30 10:11:10 2015 UTC,"Yep. It fits quite nicely into my drawer with enough space on the side to put various palettes. I took the flappy bit out because I could fit more without it. I store pretty much all my makeup into one drawer with this, excluding pencils and mascaras."
AustralianMakeup,3bm79u,Tea_inthegoodroom,3,Tue Jun 30 10:58:40 2015 UTC,"Yes! My sister got me one of these when she heard I was trying to find ways to reorganize my makeup and this is great!! It holds tonnes more than it looks like it will.  My only issue is where the long sections that fold up/down are, don't place anything in the way in that bottom section near the hinge - the whole thing pops out when you go to open it up."
AustralianMakeup,3bm79u,Shiavo,2,Tue Jun 30 14:51:11 2015 UTC,"I do! I have it on top of my Officeworks drawers, and it's very handy! I mostly use it for my favourites of things (eg. mascara, lippies, etc)."
AustralianMakeup,3bm79u,Artemisian11,2,Tue Jun 30 11:11:37 2015 UTC,"Late to the party but I do! I got it earlier this year and it has been a great investment. It holds my daily makeup including foundation, powders, bronzer, a bunch of lipliners and a few lipsticks, different eyeliners, masacaras and eye primers, a few different blushes, eyelash glue, pawpaw cream, and I keep my favourite eyeshadow palettes underneath the flappy bit. Really really happy with it :)"

AustralianMakeup,3bmd9z,breviloquent-,1 point,Wed Jul 1 09:42:26 2015 UTC,"I use it as kind of a moisturizer before foundation, its very very subtle"
AustralianMakeup,3bmd9z,criti_biti,3,Wed Jul 1 09:44:30 2015 UTC,"I am in love with Models Prefer Argan oil foundation. It's a lightweight dewy/natural foundation with light to medium coverage. I have normal to dry skin with PCOS hirsutism and it's so perfect. It sits nicely over my dry bits and it's slightly sticky so if I roll a sponge down my face it kind of sticks my fuzz down. I got the lightest shade Shell (I think, I'm not at home to check), it's very light and quite pink toned.   Still loving Models Prefer soft touch powders in photo ready and soft focus because they're pretty and soft and glowy and it feels like cheating to look perfect bc they're just so simple and easy to use.   Also quite impressed with Maybelline dream something BB cream (the pink one) that I decided to actually use on my face. I'd been using it to cover my eyelid veins and stick shadows down on lazy days (surprisingly good, doesn't crease) because I hadn't liked it on my face about a year or two ago when my skin was oily. Tried it again a week or so ago for whatever reason and really liked it. The colour match is quite good and if I just wear it on my forehead, nose, chin it blends into my cheeks nicely without looking like a half painted canvas.   Notable mentions go to Neutrogena SPF 30 facial sunscreen, Innoxa organic eye cream, OGX Kukui oil curl cream, and I got my nails done with Parlez Vous OPI which is the prettiest muted purpley grey ever."
AustralianMakeup,3bmd9z,SchultzAL,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:24:41 2015 UTC,I'm going to have to try that Argan oil foundation. Sounds like it would suit me well. :)
AustralianMakeup,3bmd9z,Garden1a,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:32:16 2015 UTC,I've also been using this on my normally oily skin.  Working great during this time of year for keeping dryness away  :)
AustralianMakeup,3bmd9z,lyzaw,2,Tue Jul 7 11:05:50 2015 UTC,"•Jessup brushes. I bought the 10 piece Kabuki set and I love them. They're so soft and fairly dense, they make my makeup application so much nicer (considering I went from an old set of rubbish Revlon brushes to this). My makeup looks so much better :)   •NYX baked blush in Journey. It's such a perfect everyday colour, and I get so many compliments when I wear it!  •Swisspers cucumber face wipes. I used to use the Simple wipes, but these are cheaper and the wipes themselves aren't textured which feels nicer on my face, and they have a very refreshing scent.  •Essence sun club bronzer. Considering this was $7.15 from Priceline (and it's big), it's very worth the money. It's my first matte bronzer and might be a little too orange for me, but I'm liking it for the price.  •Maybelline eye studio gel liner in blackest black. I absolutely love this! I'm completely new to eyeliner and this has made it so easy. I'm by no means perfect at it, but I find this much easier than liquid liner. It's very black and does not fade, but also comes off when you want it to! Definitely an A+ from me."
AustralianMakeup,3bmd9z,jamballdonut,2,Tue Jun 30 12:17:32 2015 UTC,"that blush looks so lovely! and the maybelline gel liner is my life, it will last you FOREVER (i really enjoy it in the water line)"
AustralianMakeup,3bmd9z,jamballdonut,2,Tue Jun 30 13:28:12 2015 UTC,"UGH, HOW GOOD IS THAT ESSENCE MASCARA? I swear that every mascara I've tried since just hasn't been as good  I've spent most of this month sick, celebrating my birthday, or just not wearing makeup, but my few favourites have been:   Revlon Nearly Naked Foundation - It's so sheer that it covers all my red patches so beautifully and just makes my skin look so natural and lovely and it's great MAC Fluidline in Looking Good - Suuuuuuch a beautiful deep maroon with shimmer and just ugh BEAUTIFUL.  Totally worth the outrageous $32 spent on it Too Faced Melted Lipsticks - Got 2 for my birthday and I'm in LOVE.  So beautiful and glide on really well, and are decently pigmented and just amazing! Cetaphil Cleanser for oily skin - I've been using this daily since getting it and I swear my skin has gotten 50x better because of it. I didn't use it for 2 days and am now dealing with a major breakout, bleh.  Think I'll go for the normal skin one next time though, because I feel like this one dries me out a little too much :("
AustralianMakeup,3bmd9z,Jessijames,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:57:38 2015 UTC,"that mascara is seriously HG. What colour melted lippies did you get? i love them!   used to use cetaphil cleansers a while ago and they were great, but then i do this stupid thing where i switch to a harsh cleanser because i dont feel like my face is clean unless i've stripped and scrubbed the bejesus out of it so im trying to stick to this byphasse one for as long as i can :/"
AustralianMakeup,3bmd9z,missb00,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:32:50 2015 UTC,Peony & Macaron! Saaaah pretty!  Aw no! Do you at least enjoy the byphasse one? haha

For somebody who had always been a full coverage kinda gal, I got this dirt cheap from chemist warehouse recently and let me tell you its my weekend go-to now. My skin in the last 6 months or so has really settled down thanks to SCA so this foundation does exactly what you say, just enough coverage to even my complexion out and feels and looks natural. Love it!"
AustralianMakeup,3bmd9z,missb00,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:20:54 2015 UTC,"Is this the liquid or powder? I have the powder and I find its so un-pigmented, they should just call it Naked. In no way can it beat my nude by nature (and that's coming from someone who used to hate the brand)."

I've not tried the matching powder but I think I'll steer clear now hahaha I've never been able to get nbn to work for me, the lightest shades aren't light enough and on top of that it oxidises pretty horrifically on me but quite a few rave about it which makes me wish the shade range was better!"
AustralianMakeup,3bmd9z,originalaliswan,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:38:46 2015 UTC,"See, the shades for me are perfect because Light is really yellow toned - seeing that was the thing that made me buy it in the first place. I don't find that it oxidises on me but we're all different."
AustralianMakeup,3bmd9z,originalaliswan,2,Tue Jun 30 21:53:26 2015 UTC,"Probably really late to a dead thread but I just can't resist!   Dior Diorskin NudeAir Serum Foundation. This is one of those AMAZING weightless foundations. The consistency is really watery. Rachhloves has a great review video on youtube about weightless foundations. I love love love this one. Essence Blush Up Powder Blush in Heatwave. I am loving this blush, it's completely the wrong season for a colour like this but do you see me giving a f**k? Me either. It's an almost perfect dupe for Estee Lauder's Pure Colour Blush in Witty Peach, but without the $50+ pricetag. MAC Mineralize Skinfinish in Lightscapade. I love this mostly because I got it from someone I love for my birthday but also because it's perfect in every way. So, so pretty! Loreal Glam Matte Intense Matte Glosses Not even going to try and pick a favourite colour. UNNNNGGHHHH. I think these are fairly new?? I barely even need to link to this one because we all know it, but Too Faced Semi Sweet Chocolate Bar Palette. I literally used this EVERY SINGLE MAKEUP DAY in June. True Love."
AustralianMakeup,3bmd9z,WarlockPanda,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:46:09 2015 UTC,"Uhhh, I consider my skin to be oily. Not as oily as some poor souls can be... But let's just say I never have dryness issues, and sometimes have trouble with shine. Also I'd be an NW10 or 15 if I had the money to keep myself in MAC foundations :P  Maybelline Dream Wonder Fluid Touch foundation - I've been loving the shit out of this foundation lately. Ain't no other maybelline foundation pale enough for me, and the lightest shade of this is a liiiittle dark, but I make it work. Also the semi-matte finish makes me feel flawless! Coverage is nice too :)   NYX matte lipstick in Siren - I've had it for a while, but only had the courage to wear it out in the world a few weeks ago. (Shit's DARK yo!) Now I can't stop wearing it! Makes me feel sexay. The NYX matte formula lasts beautifully and doesn't feel heavy like a MAC matte lipstick can. I have two more of their matte lipsticks in the mail right now, I love the formula so much!   MUG foiled eyeshadow in In The Spotlight - it's my go-to inner corner highlight. And lately I've been using it as my perfect pinky cheekbone and nose tip highlight. Love love love this shadow!   ELF mist and set setting spray - After setting the t-zone with my powder, I drench (and I mean DRENCH) my face with this stuff. My makeup doesn't go anywhere or separate, and I don't get oily for hours and hours. I can get through a sweaty 8 hour shift and come out of it looking almost the same as when I got there. I've tried skipping it, and I go oily and foundation starts to melt off within a couple of hours. I don't say HG status, but ima say HG status for this. It is a godsend 😍 I wish there was a bigger bottle though."

AustralianMakeup,3bmd9z,SchultzAL,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:50:43 2015 UTC,"The only other setting spray I've tried was the Australis one. Which I hated. It does nothing. And smells like roses - an absolute no no for me (rose and lavender scents makes me actually want to vomit). So I can't really compare it to the higher end setting sprays. But I personally think it does ""set"" my makeup. Definitely without a doubt extends wear by at least double if not more. And reduces general over powderiness perfectly. I don't know about the alcohol content though, I'm at work and can't check, and have never personally had issues with alcohol on my skin :/"

AustralianMakeup,3bmd9z,StrattonLove,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:32:06 2015 UTC,"This month I've really been enjoying:   Innisfree Long Wear Cushion- not too heavy, just the right amount of coverage I'm looking for (covering redness). It is fairly long wear, has a touch of shine control and is very convenient for touch ups. Guerlain Maxi Lash Mascara- I have come to the end of my full sized tube and I've started on a deluxe sample I have. I really like the formula and would repurchase, but I can't justify the price for something I replace every 3-6 months. I'll be sad when it is gone. TonyMoly Tangerine Whitening Hand Cream- I love this hand cream. I used so much hand cream in winter because my skin tends to be very dry, especially around my finger joints and elbows. This is super cute and I love the fragrance. Ciate Chinchilla Nail Polish- I'm just loving this colour on my nails at the moment. I've done 5 manis with this colour in the last month. If I ever manage to finish the bottle (which may actually happen!) I will definitely repurchase Hourglass Mineral Veil Primer- I'm just about finished the travel size. I like the matte feeling and I find it really helps with the longevity of my makeup. I will repurchase once I have worked through my other primers, or once it becomes summer again (It's perfect in summer)."
AustralianMakeup,3bmd9z,Darmop,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:44:11 2015 UTC,"W7 Absolute Lashes mascara. This is basically a dupe of Benefit's They're Real...for $5. I used up a tube of They're Real a long time ago, when it was first released, and I liked it but not enough to rebuy it all the time. The only problem with the W7 is it's not sealed when you buy it, so I try and get one from the back of the display in case anyone has ""sampled"" any of them. Shanghai Suzy Miss Cassandra Peony. The only everyday pink lipstick I've ever been able to wear. Shiseido High Beam White. Matte highlight? It looks good? Whatttt. Garnier's Miracle Skin Cream (not the BB cream, the weird white one). Great for every day, very very light coverage and doesn't dry my skin out."

AustralianMakeup,3bmd9z,Tonkie,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:59:10 2015 UTC,"Skin type: Oily but dehydrated during winter. I'm on a no-buy for makeup so most of these are products I've ""rediscovered"" my love for.   Max Factor Creme Puff Blush in Nude Mauve: This gets a lot of hype and rightfully so. I bought this back in March and it was an impulse buy. No regrets though. It's velvety smooth and has a nice sheen without chunky glitter. Avene Thermal Water: I have two cans of this that I intend to finish off. I loved it in the summer because it was cooling but so far, I've been using it in winter to help with my irritated and dehydrated skin. YSL Rouge Volupte Shine in Pourpre Intouchable: I got this last year and wore it last winter. Now that I've finished my Rouge Coco Shine from Chanel, this becomes my new go-to sheer. It's a beautiful deep berry colour that suits this time of year best. I hate the mango scent though and would rather have Chanel's grandma rose. Nuxe Reve de Miel lip balm: I love this lip balm best during the cooler months. It was pushed aside during summer when I wanted something lightweight but it's come back to save my lips from dry, flaky hell. Dior Addict lipstick in Perfecto: Beautiful formula but it doesn't suit the deep crimson colour. I got this last year with my YSL lipstick. On its own, it goes on patchy, runs outside lip line and is a b**** to work with. Nevertheless, I've used this more than my YSL because: 1) it's on my list to finish off and 2) I adore the glossy formula. I would not recommend this but I have a long love-hate relationship with this lip. I've probably got about 20% of this lippie left and would finish it this winter, or into the coming spring."

I also like smudging UD Whisky liner (warm brown) along the lash line.   Also LOVING the Lanolips 101 Ointment. My poor lips are wrecked, and this has actually fixed them. Nothing else has worked. The Lanolips and exfoliating with the Elf Lip Exfoliator has been a godsend. Hopefully I can actually wear lipstick this weekend!"

AustralianMakeup,3bmott,Artemisian11,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:23:39 2015 UTC,"Looking at pretty much everything :)  I want a couple new foundations, concealer, mascara, primer, blush and bronzers, maybe a few eye-shadow palettes, lipsticks etc."
AustralianMakeup,3bmott,jen-iscool,6,Wed Jul 1 00:31:40 2015 UTC,"Mmmm.  Well here is what I love!  Clinique Foundation (You should check out their skin care too)  Too Faced Chocolate Bar Eyeshadow Palette  Urban Decay Naked Palettes- Have 1,2&3 don't have a favourite, love them all  Urban Decay Setting Spray  Soap and Glory Lip Plumper- check out their bath stuff too, all so nice. My favs are the body wash, scrub and hand cream  Benefit Mascara - Not everyone likes this, but it makes my lashes go to another level of huge  Clump Crusher Mascara is also a fav, about a lot cheaper  Bare Minerals Concealor  Anastasia Dip Brow this makes my brows look really natural. Watch some youtube clips to learn how to use it.  Mac Lip Sticks - I have about 10, all are great.  Mac Pigment Eye Shadows- I have a few of these. Mixed with Mac Fixed Plus they are so bright!  I dont wear them all the time though.  Mac 217 Blending Brush - Use this everyday, best purchase.  Ben Nye Face Powder - I am quite fair, I mix banana and fair  Australis AC Contour kit  Tarte Bronzer  Tarte Blush  MAC Blush is great too, I cant remember what colour I have"

I have heard some really good things about the benefit mascara, and will take a look at all the other products. I'm trying to find my go to mascara(s) and was also thinking of trying out the too faced better than sex mascara too."

AustralianMakeup,3bmaqk,buffystar,2,Tue Jun 30 11:00:42 2015 UTC,"I use the silk creme moisturising version. Apparently the silk creme is best for dry skin, and the oil free is best for oily skin types.  Anyway, i love it. It's super blendable, gives amazing coverage with only the teeniest amount, and it stays put all day, even without primer. It has a really subtle dewy sheen to it as well.  I never tried the old formula, so i can't make any comparisons, i'm sorry. But i do think it's worth the rather hefty price tag."
AustralianMakeup,3bmaqk,toasty_feet,2,Wed Jul 1 02:55:27 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info! Adore Beauty is now stocking both versions in my shade (DJs didn't have it) so I'm going to get both and hope they work well! I'm sure it's still great!
AustralianMakeup,3blvso,szarkasm,2,Tue Jun 30 07:26:59 2015 UTC,"Sorry for terrible photo quality but I was in a bit of a rush.   I'm unsure if it's just the Chemist Warehouse range, or whether it's the same for other stores in the future, but it seems the shade range is more limited here. In Priceline there were about 10 shades in the original Fit Me line; we seem to be missing a lot of inbetween shades (120-220, 220-235). Also definitely sure there were 1-2 shades darker than 310 shown here. Perhaps this is just a trial run and there will be more shades coming?   As for the actual foundation itself I'm not 100% sure but I feel like the shades have been changed slightly from the original line. 310 usually matches me perfectly, but I found the Matte + Poreless 310 to be leaning more pink than the original. Just swatching on my hand though, I found after a few minutes it blended into my skin tone better and the pink tone was less noticeable.   It definitely had a nice matte finish, felt quite smooth on the back of my hand and looked like a nice coverage. I didn't buy one because I wasn't too sure about the shade match, but if anyone else has picked up a bottle I'd love to hear a review! Also if anyone has spotted it in any other location, I'd love to hear about that as well :)"
AustralianMakeup,3blvso,reddit-g,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:35:19 2015 UTC,"Six shades is an awful selection, and none look like they'd match my light olive skin."
AustralianMakeup,3blvso,reddit-g,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:39:19 2015 UTC,"Yep awful is pretty spot on. Although it's a limited selection of their full range, the Fit Me line were quite careful to make shades within the cool/neutral/warm categories. I'm glad they included 310, as that was my original shade, and it does lean fairly yellow/olive. 235 was quite pink, 220 was olive. I didn't swatch the rest as they weren't near my skin tone, but perhaps one of the lighter shades might lean yellow?"
AustralianMakeup,3blvso,Darmop,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:42:12 2015 UTC,Unfortunately I don't think the lightest and most yellow shade would be yellow enough for me. It probably wouldn't bother me too much if the line wasn't called 'Fit Me' haha.
AustralianMakeup,3blvso,Darmop,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:47:18 2015 UTC,They only had 6 shades at Priceline World Square - Maybelline Australian website only shows 6 shades too.   Priceline was almost entirely sold out of it too.
AustralianMakeup,3blvso,jodes,2,Tue Jun 30 09:39:50 2015 UTC,"Ah that's disappointing. The Chemist Warehouse I went to was at least fairly well stocked with all the shades available. I based my description on the shade range off the Priceline website which still has the original foundation and their shades listed.   The American website for Ulta and American Maybelline page has a crazy 16 shade range. Of course I suppose you can't expect us to carry a range as large as the American lines, but 6 shades does seem rather limited and disappointing. Considering their claim as ""Fit Me"" is to find the perfect shade and lots of cool-neutral-warm options, their selection is pretty lack lustre right now."
AustralianMakeup,3blvso,gospursgo_,4,Tue Jun 30 09:47:57 2015 UTC,It is frustrating. Apparently Australians don't have neutral skin! News to my very neutral face!
AustralianMakeup,3bmdgo,WhoopWindshear,5,Tue Jun 30 11:35:57 2015 UTC,My mum always looks really healthy with makeup geek's spellbound.   It's extremely versatile and gives a natural pop of colour whilst being matte so you don't have any shimmer catching on dry skin or lines. It's also kind of foolproof because it's  buildable when using a real hair brush like the zoeva angled one so no clown face.
AustralianMakeup,3bmdgo,seenoright,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:48:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks, for the suggestion, checking it out now!"
AustralianMakeup,3bmdgo,ArrghUrrgh,3,Wed Jul 1 06:13:19 2015 UTC,I got my mum hourglass' mood exposure (browny-plum) she loves it and it sounds like she has a similar colouring to your mum

AustralianMakeup,3bmdgo,jamballdonut,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:12:59 2015 UTC,"If it's a special present, hourglass would be my number one recommendation. They are just so lovely and natural looking."
AustralianMakeup,3bmdgo,freezethefire,3,Wed Jul 1 13:05:08 2015 UTC,"I really love Savvy Classic Blushes, and the best part is they're only $4.99 and cruelty free.  Plum is a really beautiful satin? matte? (There's no shimmer that I can see, so I think it's matte, but I'm not 100% sure) beautiful deep plum colour.  They have 6 in the range, and my favourites are Silky Pink, Rose, and Plum, so you could always just go have a swatch fest to see which one would be most suitable though! (The only ""downside"" is that they're SUPER pigmented, so a little definitely goes a long way, and there has been a few times that I've left the house with clown cheeks, so it'll last you forever, but it takes a bit to get used to.  It also lasts on my cheeks all day for me, so it's not going to fade and disappear after like 2 hours)"
AustralianMakeup,3bmdgo,jamballdonut,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:00:27 2015 UTC,"I got these after seeing you rave about them and they're great! I love plum, then I also have an orangey/bronze one and a light satiny pink one. So gorgeous. I like the packaging too."

AustralianMakeup,3bmdgo,elfies_,2,Wed Jul 1 06:13:48 2015 UTC,"Fashion Fair has a really brown/crimson powder blush, I love the shade 'Diva' for lighter complexions but be warned... it's EXTREMELY pigmented and needs a good brush (or beauty blender) to make it blend properly. It's a fantastic shade though, I find the hot pink shades typically don't work as well for older skin so having an almost brown colour looks the most natural (if that's what she's going for). Good luck!"

AustralianMakeup,3blspj,passthemustard,4,Tue Jun 30 22:42:50 2015 UTC,The By Terry Hyaluronic Hydra Powder is my favourite translucent powder - like - ever.  It is super expensive but a tub will last you a year.  I even use it at night over my moisturiser sometimes for it's skin care properties.

AustralianMakeup,3blspj,hollybn7498,4,Tue Jun 30 09:02:45 2015 UTC,NARS Smudgeproof Eyeshadow Base. Looks like a regular eye primer but this is magic. Even my creasiest eyeshadows in the creasiest part of my hooded eyelids don't budge with this on. It's also very easy to blend with (doesn't make shadows stick in the one spot) and easy to remove with makeup remover.
AustralianMakeup,3blspj,Darmop,2,Tue Jun 30 11:59:51 2015 UTC,I agree! Best eyeshadow primer ever! Worth every cent.

AustralianMakeup,3bhckc,badassbettie,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:53:26 2015 UTC,"That's a really pretty colour, looks like a good dupe for the Too Faced bronzer I use. I'll have to check it out."
AustralianMakeup,3bhckc,littlefang1993,6,Mon Jun 29 08:52:55 2015 UTC,"If you want something creamy, try Illamasqua Hollow  I use the old NYX Taupe, but when I want a bit more oomph, I use Chi Chi's eyeshadow in Living on a prayer  I'm pale/warm. If NC10 was a thing, that would be me"
AustralianMakeup,3bhckc,littlefang1993,1 point,Mon Jun 29 09:00:10 2015 UTC,"I'll look into it, the packing looks a bit quirky. I've heard really good things about the brand. Yeah those two products have already been mentioned, I'll definitely look into them they seem pretty popular."
AustralianMakeup,3bhckc,WhoopWindshear,2,Mon Jun 29 09:27:44 2015 UTC,"Seconding illamasqua's hollow! NC15 for reference.  I find it super easy to blend, subtle but I can see the difference when I put it on.  You could make the argument that the product in the corners may be hard to use up due to the packaging but it hasn't bothered me yet (and I have had it for about 1 year now)."
AustralianMakeup,3bhckc,gospursgo_,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:46:24 2015 UTC,"Also NC15, yeah that's what I'm concerned about about since it's weird packaging."
AustralianMakeup,3bhckc,Jessijames,3,Mon Jun 29 10:57:00 2015 UTC,"I really don't think it would pose too much of a problem, just use a smaller brush to get the product out?"
AustralianMakeup,3bhckc,seenoright,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:56:14 2015 UTC,I use Hollow! It's brill! I'm a neutral toned pale
AustralianMakeup,3bhckc,gospursgo_,6,Mon Jun 29 14:10:15 2015 UTC,Anyone have experience with cream contour products? Keep contemplating the Clinique contour chubby stick then talking myself out of it when it read mixed reviews. Hope I'm not hijacking your thread u/cumpet92 :*
AustralianMakeup,3bhckc,badasshobbit,2,Mon Jun 29 06:38:16 2015 UTC,"I've never used cream contour until recently when I picked up a particle contour stick from life's entropy - it's a definite learning experience but so far I don't hate it haha it's just extra work for me rather than using a powder contour. -  and their shade range is great! But then again, if I like it you might not ;) hahahaha"
AustralianMakeup,3bhckc,badassbettie,2,Mon Jun 29 07:01:22 2015 UTC,I got the fit me concealer in 35. You can use it to see how the technique of cream contouring goes for you before investing in the Clinique.   It works fine for me but it's kind of more like a more natural look to bringing dimension back I the face. If I wanted a more dramatic contour then powder contour over it.
AustralianMakeup,3bhckc,Jessijames,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:41:31 2015 UTC,"I think that's what I already have, it works but I'm thinking with a cream I can be a bit more precise and use a brush and that's to fiddly with an applicator. I've recently realized my nose is pretty uneven/crooked and I want to try and straighten it out with contouring."
AustralianMakeup,3bhckc,gospursgo_,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:08:04 2015 UTC,"i was considering that one! or the Fit Me foundation stick actually, i swatched the darkest one and it didnt look orange :D"
AustralianMakeup,3bhckc,badasshobbit,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:49:25 2015 UTC,Don't worry. Thats what kind of what I'm trying to find out. I keep seeing tutorials and they use cream products and I want a more defined look which everyone appears to get from using cream products.
AustralianMakeup,3bhckc,Jessijames,4,Mon Jun 29 09:01:15 2015 UTC,I use chichi baked eyeshadow in living on a prayer. I'm pale and cool toned - this eyeshadow works perfect.
AustralianMakeup,3bhckc,Jessijames,8,Mon Jun 29 07:47:24 2015 UTC,I use this too  Us badasses know about life!
AustralianMakeup,3bhckc,spyduhgirl,2,Mon Jun 29 09:06:59 2015 UTC,I think this is next on my list to try...
AustralianMakeup,3bhckc,asteroyale,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:49:23 2015 UTC,I'll have to look next time I'm at target. It looks pretty purple toned when I googled it. How does chi chi go for blending? Do you get good colour pay off?
AustralianMakeup,3bhckc,catrixo,2,Mon Jun 29 09:09:46 2015 UTC,"the baked shadows are pigmented, buttery and so easy to blend :)"
AustralianMakeup,3bhckc,Tea_inthegoodroom,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:48:25 2015 UTC,I don't think it pulls purple on my skin at all.  It's definitely pigmented.  I don't have trouble blending it into my cheekbones but I think that's a testament to my brush - not the product.  I use a real techniques fan brush (from the sculpting set) - it's duo fibre so the hairs are quite sparse. It builds the product gradually and pretty much does the blending for me. I used a denser brush with the same product once and thought I looked like a mad woman haha. Edit - it does blend lovely on the eyes. Based on that I'm sure you wouldn't have trouble with blending.
AustralianMakeup,3bhckc,Tea_inthegoodroom,4,Tue Jun 30 13:28:45 2015 UTC,I tried the TF Milk chocolate soleil but it pulled wayyyy too orange and muddy on me. I'm currently on the hunt for a new contour shade so in the meantime I've gone back to the FOA contour kit to rid emergency over which isn't orange but is still muddy for me.
AustralianMakeup,3bhckc,apasserby,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:59:52 2015 UTC,"That's weird, it's not warm at all on me and blends so well. Maybe you got a bad batch or something."
AustralianMakeup,3bhckc,apasserby,3,Mon Jun 29 09:04:05 2015 UTC,"I think it's that it oxidises on me, rather than its the fault of the product itself."
AustralianMakeup,3bhckc,criticalenemy,1 point,Mon Jun 29 09:07:32 2015 UTC,"Oh okay. I'll have to keep an eye on mine, I don't think mine has ever done that but I don't normally get to check it through the day."
AustralianMakeup,3bhckc,criticalenemy,5,Mon Jun 29 09:13:11 2015 UTC,I usually use Benefit Hoola
AustralianMakeup,3bhckc,afropowers_activate,2,Mon Jun 29 07:24:43 2015 UTC,"I've heard great things, how do you find the packaging? It looks really fiddly, like a compact just seems easier."
AustralianMakeup,3bhckc,afropowers_activate,2,Mon Jun 29 09:05:53 2015 UTC,Not OP but the packaging is a lot sturdier than it appears! Unless you're really going at it and throwing it around the box isn't going to break or change shape. There's not much mess either as the box is pretty deep. It closes well but not sure how well it stays closed while travelling I haven't taken it along with me before. As for the product I have NC25-30 skin and it's great as a contour and doesn't pull orange on me :)
AustralianMakeup,3bhckc,Artemisian11,2,Mon Jun 29 11:07:38 2015 UTC,"The magnet on it keeps it closed well while travelling, I've taken mine away with me countless times and it's still going strong! I feel like I've hardly made a dent in mine too and I use it most days."
AustralianMakeup,3bhckc,Artemisian11,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:10:08 2015 UTC,"Didn't know it had a magnet, I'm heading to Myer this week so I'll have a look at the Benefit counter."
AustralianMakeup,3bhckc,MsOrangeCake,5,Tue Jun 30 01:09:03 2015 UTC,NYX blush in Taupe or Australis AC On tour palette if I want to put more effort into contouring. The palette also works great on my eyes to deepen the socket. On a daily basis I'll alternate between MAC Harmony and NARS Laguna.
AustralianMakeup,3bhckc,Stopitm8,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:33:07 2015 UTC,"I use my ABH when I want to put more effort in. I did go to pick up the Australis one to see what it's like but I don't think I would use every shade so I put it back. Do you use them all? Obviously not at once. The MAC and NARS products look so nice, do you have a favorite?"
AustralianMakeup,3bhckc,gospursgo_,2,Mon Jun 29 09:22:52 2015 UTC,"I stick to the bottom left and middle shades (mostly the middle) and have never touched the bottom third - it's the worst shade out of the palette imo. While the yellow powder is really great for highlighting, it turns to absolute clumpy crap after 2 hours on me. I don't use the pink shade but I do like the shimmery highlight, even though it's not particularly unique. Can't complain, I think paid like $11 something for it?  I think right now MAC Harmony is my favourite. It's slightly crimson so it helps bring dimension and colour back to the face. Like many reviewers have said, it's a great one for winter. I swear the Laguna bronzer is bottomless because I've had it for nearly 3 years and have only made a slight dent. It's great for warming the face but only okay for contouring. I'm not sure if it's a cult product because there weren't many nice bronzers around when it was initially released but now, you can certainly get something similar at a much cheaper price."
AustralianMakeup,3bhckc,Stopitm8,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:28:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm pretty sure my Too Faced bronzer is cheaper than NARS and it also feels never ending. I abuse the crap out of that product and I haven't hit pan yet. I'll definitely look into both of them though, thank you."
AustralianMakeup,3bhckc,gospursgo_,2,Mon Jun 29 11:06:46 2015 UTC,"I use the ashey Brown colour on my nyx auburn eyebrow powder lol, I'm fairly pale and the colour actually works pretty well, application can be a bit annoying at first as it can just pile on, but there's probably better options, I use it because I'm cheap skate and it seems like a waste lol (i only use the reddish palette for my eyebrows)."
AustralianMakeup,3bhckc,pyjamasquid,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:29:21 2015 UTC,"Why not, I've bought palettes before and feel like it's a waste because I don't use every shade. So at least your getting your money's worth."
AustralianMakeup,3bhckc,gospursgo_,3,Mon Jun 29 09:20:08 2015 UTC,I know! Like it kinda makes sense to have lots of different eye shadow colours but why do I need to pay for two different colours for my eyebrows? lol
AustralianMakeup,3bhckc,pyjamasquid,1 point,Mon Jun 29 09:39:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah I only ever use a single colour for my eyebrows, maybe if your really fair and want it lighter in some areas but I don't and I think most people use a single colour."
AustralianMakeup,3bhckc,gospursgo_,2,Mon Jun 29 11:02:01 2015 UTC,I use the Nars Contour blush in Geniah (the darkest shade). It is absolutely beautiful.

AustralianMakeup,3bhckc,jamballdonut,2,Mon Jun 29 11:50:55 2015 UTC,"Napoleon Perdis Greatest Hits cheek palette. It's powder, and its got 2 contour shades, 2 blushes and 2 highlighters. I love it. Super easy to blend and super compact so I usually use all shades to contour/blush/highlight and create an eye look on the go or when traveling."
AustralianMakeup,3bhckc,gospursgo_,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:23:13 2015 UTC,That palette is so pretty. Are the colours shimmery? I can't really tell in the pictures.
AustralianMakeup,3bhckc,jamballdonut,2,Mon Jun 29 11:56:44 2015 UTC,The highlighters are but the contours and blushes are matte. They're really beautiful.
AustralianMakeup,3bhckc,gospursgo_,2,Mon Jun 29 12:02:46 2015 UTC,"I pretty much always use Too Faced Chocolate Soleil, which for my NC20 skin gives the nicest soft shadow.

AustralianMakeup,3bh7og,flowerbobon,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:56:41 2015 UTC,In my opinion Bourjois is slightly cheaper ($3-4 cheaper) but they have a lot more than what we have here in Perth.

I was doing my weekly grocery shop at my local Coles yesterday and I noticed the pharmacy next door was renovating, and because of that they had a whole heap of products on sale. I yelped in joy when i saw Max Factor up to 75% off and picked up 2 of their recently released Creme Puff Blushes! Couldn't believe my luck - I've been meaning to try these out and another user on this sub highly recommended them.   No regrets, I am absolutely smitten! Do recommend.

Pretty much my go to. I use the pot version a little more cause I do like my eye liner really pigmented. The Loreal is okay. The pigmentation is not the best but its something that's easy to use.   Ones I haven't tried but have heard good things from:   Physicians Formula Eye Booster   Ones I didn't like:   Maybelline Master Precise. Was not pigmented for me at all. It didn't ""draw"" anything when I used it. It was like nothing??? I also have tried the Maybelline Master Precise Graphic Pen. That was a little hard to use because its so bulky. It would also erase what I was trying to go over.  Max Factor Liner (dont know which one specifically) But the formula become like crusty?? almost. It flaked badly."
AustralianMakeup,3be3m0,freezethefire,3,Sun Jun 28 11:16:19 2015 UTC,I had the exact same failures as you - Maybelline master precise and the max factor one. Master precise I bought TWO to be sure and they were both duds! I use the dried up ones now as gel liner brushes. The max factor one I took overseas with me and yeah once it dries it flakes off! So weird.

AustralianMakeup,3be3m0,constellationsjr,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:57:43 2015 UTC,I've tried 3 and all of them are complete crap IMO.
AustralianMakeup,3be3m0,IrmaGehrd,4,Mon Jun 29 02:29:09 2015 UTC,I think the Essence Felt Tip pen is really great! I use it to get my shape and then I use their liquid liner to get it super black and glossy! It's about $7 for the both of them and it does not budge. I slept with it on once (literally the second time I've slept with makeup on in my life) and my dramatic cat eye was still in perfect condition the next morning!  I have used the Maybelline Master Precise and personally didn't like it but lots of people love it so who knows
AustralianMakeup,3be3m0,hellebora,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:27:07 2015 UTC,I found the Essence Felt Tip pen is ok but using it alone the pigmentation is not great at all... but then again I compare everything to the Stila Stay all Day and they're in completely different price ranges haha
AustralianMakeup,3be3m0,Suriiiiiii,6,Mon Jun 29 06:58:43 2015 UTC,"I picked up a Maybelline Master Precise last week and have used it a couple of times, loving it! Really easy to work with, lasts until I take it off, no smudging! Not bad - picked it up for $7 in a 50% off sale."
AustralianMakeup,3be3m0,jamballdonut,1 point,Sun Jun 28 11:01:06 2015 UTC,I've heard some good things about this one! Might wait till its on sale to give it a try though :)))
AustralianMakeup,3be3m0,Shiavo,3,Sun Jun 28 11:02:21 2015 UTC,"Another +1 for Master Precise. Also, try out the Essence liners, I've got the 'easy liner' one which I'm liking for everyday, although it's not great for thick lines (if you go over it too many times it can look patchy). Don't get the 'thin' one from Essence, it stains your skin and the tip is just ridiculous and dries out super fast."

AustralianMakeup,3be3m0,DominionGalactica,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:01:33 2015 UTC,"I like the Master Precise for the ease of use, so quick and easy to create a precise line and wing. But what I found is it does transfer little bit to my upper lids. I do have oily lids but the Hyperglossy liquid liner never transfers even during summer. Just wanted to let you know this."
AustralianMakeup,3be3m0,The_Cat_whiskerer,3,Mon Jun 29 01:52:09 2015 UTC,"My favourite the Maybelline Master Precise, but I'm also really loving the Essence range (I just haven't tried them enough to have a solid opinion on them yet, but I've been using Master Precise since it first came out, so it's definitely my fave)"
AustralianMakeup,3bd2a8,stingyasfuck,31,Sun Jun 28 01:54:28 2015 UTC,"Mecca girl here!! I can absolutely confirm that we do not receive commission or have personal sales targets. The closest thing we get is an end of month bonus - but this is team based and is distributed according to the store profits and also amount of hours each person worked. At Mecca we do not strive to make the biggest sales, but hope to give you (and all our customers) the best service and best advice that we can offer :) if you do have any positive feedback, be sure to forward it to the store manager, Mecca customer service, or simply post on their facebook page. Girls (and guys!) who provide excellent service are always rewarded for their efforts, and the company really takes rewarding their employees very seriously!"
AustralianMakeup,3bd2a8,elfies_,7,Sun Jun 28 09:51:03 2015 UTC,"Many years ago I worked at LUSH and we didn't have any personal sales goals just big store ones and if you got a big sale you were praised for the good work you did to bring the store goal up. And boy did I ever manage to sell so much when I didn't have to worry how every little interaction might cost me a sale, it makes for better sales people and people want to come in knowing you won't be harried for your money. It makes me want to go into shops where I know people aren't being stressed out into making sometimes unrealistic personal quotas, when I did perfume sales/promo I sold exactly ONE thing in the brief time I was there. Mind the folk at certain perfume counter move from department store to store and have no say or sway in what stock they had that day. People would come up to my counter and ask for X and I was like, we don't have this and have to try push something else and hope you can change their mind. But that doesn't happen - so I'm glad that every time I go into a Mecca or Kit there's no reek of desperation to clock a sale or else."
AustralianMakeup,3bd2a8,berlin_chair_,2,Sun Jun 28 12:30:49 2015 UTC,I think that Lush is the pushiest store I have ever been in. I try avoid it now. :(
AustralianMakeup,3bd2a8,prettyreckless11,3,Sun Jun 28 14:02:19 2015 UTC,"I know that it's changed over the years which is sad, I don't go in there anymore because I'm not into heavily scented things anymore."
AustralianMakeup,3bd2a8,berlin_chair_,6,Sun Jun 28 14:13:37 2015 UTC,I dont like when people chat to me like Im a 5 year old and shove things in my face and grab my arm to rub massage bars on it.. Just.let.me.shop.
AustralianMakeup,3bd2a8,prettyreckless11,2,Sun Jun 28 14:21:11 2015 UTC,"Friend of a Lush salesperson here. From what my friend has told me there is still no commissions or personal sales targets in the store she works at, but they do have a large store target. From my observations though, it looks like the salespeople they choose to work there are naturally very passionate people - and they're further encouraged to be outgoing, 'confident' and overly-familiar sometimes. They're also fed a lot of information about their products and the charities their products support (etc) so that they have an emotional connection to the sales and naturally try to push things. They seem to be really made to 'believe in the products' and the 'ideology' of the store as a whole. Now, I don't mean to sound so negative about Lush, they do have some genuinely good products, but there is something just a tad unsettling about their business model."
AustralianMakeup,3bd2a8,IrmaGehrd,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:31:40 2015 UTC,Concur. My friend worked there for two weeks before resigning from the insane pressure.   Lush used to be one of my favourite stores but now I can't stand the constant pressure from the sales staff (I know it's not their fault though). I wish the company would revisit its sales ethos because I love their products. I know heaps of other people who feel the same.
AustralianMakeup,3bd2a8,deluxecreampuff,2,Mon Jun 29 02:00:41 2015 UTC,"I still use their things, but I just feel awkward when I have to go and buy them. Also, I've realised that one of their rose scented bath products gives me terrible day-long migraines if im around it too long."
AustralianMakeup,3bd2a8,IrmaGehrd,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:18:51 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thank you so much for the first-hand information! :D"
AustralianMakeup,3bd2a8,idealgrind,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:00:10 2015 UTC,I'm actually really glad to hear this re: feedback. I had a makeup lesson with an amazing sales assistant here in Brisbane and she taught me how to do my makeup for a gypsy/boho event I was going to. I'll definitely pass on my feedback after reading this :)
AustralianMakeup,3bd2a8,Jessijames,9,Mon Jul 13 04:20:37 2015 UTC,"Having worked in sales environments for years and working for commission, I don't know for certain but in my opinion I don't think they do. I've been served by one person and rung up by another or handed over dozens of times. When you work for commission you fight to keep a customer yours and not let them end up with a different member of staff - the Mecca staff are helpful and not pushy like commission staff can be!   But you, I like you. Having worked for commission it's nice to have someone come back to you to make sure you get the sale, so thank you. We need more people like you in his world."
AustralianMakeup,3bd2a8,jamballdonut,2,Sun Jun 28 05:29:45 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I know how shitty it can be to work in customer service,  so I try and make sure to look out for people who do!"
AustralianMakeup,3bd2a8,Jessijames,4,Sun Jun 28 14:58:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if they work on commission, but you could always send in an email and tell them how blown away you were by her service? (Once you find out her name, of course)"

AustralianMakeup,3bdacr,badassbettie,2,Sun Jun 28 08:10:24 2015 UTC,"A while ago I was specifically looking at this blush, but found out that it has ethylhexyl palmitate in it. That stuff is highly comedogenic and can cause acne, so beware!"

AustralianMakeup,3bdacr,Shiavo,1 point,Sun Jun 28 12:03:17 2015 UTC,"I have an eyeshadow set by them ( True Love Collection ).  While I don't mind this set, I find that the colours are a bit to shimmery for me (including the bronzer in the box which is very unpigmented) and they're a bit hard to blend out.   However, in that being said, the shadows are really nice colours and most have good pigment. So I'd be curious to see what their other products are like!"
AustralianMakeup,3bdacr,deluxecreampuff,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:17:33 2015 UTC,Bought my daughter a little eyeshadow palette to play with. It wasn't cheap - $10 for a very tiny palette with three shades. The quality is pretty crap. The light shadow colours have barely any pigmentation at all and they seem very powdery.
AustralianMakeup,3bcsue,-eternal_sunshine-,6,Sun Jun 28 00:16:19 2015 UTC,An Essence limited edition cream blush. It was only like $3.99 and I loved it.

Luckily I found it a little while ago so turns out they've started stocking it again, much to my relief and happiness. It's gorgeous. HG blush right there."

AustralianMakeup,3bal82,missb00,8,Sat Jun 27 22:04:27 2015 UTC,"I think that this is not only super shady and unethical but also is probably false advertising as it is intentionally misleading customer in regards to the colour of their product.  Kind of off topic - Honestly, I'm not surprised. I remember reading a thread on this sub some time ago where a girl ordered a falsely advertised product from Klara (they advertised the colour as lilac but it looked more fuchsia in person) and I have thought they were shady ever since.   Thread if you're interested: http://www.reddit.com/r/AustralianMakeup/comments/2ro76o/my_order_with_klara_cosmetics/"
AustralianMakeup,3bal82,Jessijames,9,Sat Jun 27 11:08:09 2015 UTC,"And then they proceeded to treat her like shit for trying to ask for the situation to be remedied.  Klara cosmetics are assholes, I'm surprised they have 75k likes on Facebook (I want to believe that a bunch of them are fake accounts given how little engagement they have on all their posts from users)"
AustralianMakeup,3bal82,Crumpet92,6,Sat Jun 27 14:26:17 2015 UTC,"Yup, that thread and what happened after it put Klara on my shit list. I wouldn't be surprised if they paid for their likes."
AustralianMakeup,3bal82,Jessijames,3,Sat Jun 27 19:06:47 2015 UTC,"I'm betting they just paid for all of those likes (You know how you can ""boost"" your posts? & pay for likers? & then they rarely interact?) because 75k likes and only 7-30 likes per photo? Something isn't adding up."
AustralianMakeup,3bal82,Crumpet92,3,Sun Jun 28 05:48:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was thinking that might be it, I thought Facebook had done a bit of a crackdown on it but I'm sure it still happens.  It definitely is suss.  This brand just plain sucks, I mean before all this, I was not willing to pay $50+ for a foundation that's stocked mostly in a Supermarket (and doesn't ever seem to have any testers) but then they seem to treat their customers like crap and steal images, it's like the winning combination of being a PoS company.   >: ("
AustralianMakeup,3bal82,Jessijames,5,Sun Jun 28 07:36:22 2015 UTC,"I feel like it's one of those situations where you already don't like something/someone, then they do something and you're just like ""HA! I KNEW I DIDN'T LIKE YOU FOR A REASON!"" and feel oddly validated that they've done something wrong/annoying"
AustralianMakeup,3bal82,Crumpet92,3,Sun Jun 28 07:46:13 2015 UTC,"Yep! I actually commented on that thread (Pretty sure anyway) I thought I mentioned it in my post, but apparently not, haha, that's why I made this thread - I just can't get over how dodgy that is! Like, it's very obviously not their photo, considering OCC has a specific style, but ugh, I don't know whether to comment on their photo or not >___>"
AustralianMakeup,3bal82,Jessijames,5,Sat Jun 27 11:11:41 2015 UTC,We all forget things haha. I just hope they get what they deserve for false advertising. I haven't really liked Klara Cosmetics after reading that post and have alway thought they were crazy charging more Myer prices for their products in Coles.
AustralianMakeup,3bal82,starward-,6,Sat Jun 27 11:43:56 2015 UTC,"Ugh, even since I saw that they charge $50 for a foundation sold at COLES I've just been like r u srs? Like REALLY?"

AustralianMakeup,3b9z75,WarlockPanda,5,Sat Jun 27 06:32:23 2015 UTC,Priceline and target generally have seperate promotional lines (at least in Adelaide they have for the past ~4 years) :)
AustralianMakeup,3b9z75,jamballdonut,1 point,Sat Jun 27 10:16:55 2015 UTC,"I thought it might have been target. I find that they sometime share the releases, but other times they are exclusive to target or Priceline but I find it hard to find that information online."
AustralianMakeup,3b9z75,WarlockPanda,1 point,Sat Jun 27 11:24:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and the Essence Instagram page only posts about the releases in their country (Germany? I think? I'm not 100% where Essence is based) so that's annoying too, because the Nauti-Girl or Nauti-Cool collection or whatever they're advertising looks SO AWESOME."
AustralianMakeup,3b9z75,jamballdonut,1 point,Sat Jun 27 11:32:34 2015 UTC,yes. Yes. YES! I am dying for this collection right now! If anyone spots it anywhere make a PSA so we know when/if it hits our shores!
AustralianMakeup,3b9z75,WarlockPanda,1 point,Sat Jun 27 11:45:16 2015 UTC,"In my local Target! It must have only juuuust been put out because it was all untouched. This highlighter is a bizarre texture, but the colour is like an almost iridescent lavender. I'm tempted to pick up the pink shade of it now too! The polishes looked nice too."
AustralianMakeup,3b9z75,WarlockPanda,1 point,Sat Jun 27 07:52:44 2015 UTC,Thanks. The lavender tint to the highlighter is lovely. I'm gonna check it out soon. You have a lovely highlighter collection.
AustralianMakeup,3b9z75,starward-,1 point,Sat Jun 27 11:25:15 2015 UTC,Thank you Panda! Highlighters and blush are oddly the things I lust after the most but by far are the products I have the smallest collections of. Somehow I can justify fifty of the same colour family lipstick but that doesn't extend to blushes or highlighters haha
AustralianMakeup,3b9z75,starward-,1 point,Sat Jun 27 11:34:23 2015 UTC,I found them at Target today and they had the polish I wanted from the line. Thanks again!

AustralianMakeup,3b7oaq,bbaek,3,Fri Jun 26 17:07:46 2015 UTC,"I haven't tried it, but if you can get to a mecca store, ask for a sample!"
AustralianMakeup,3b7oaq,WarlockPanda,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:29:48 2015 UTC,I did just that a few days back and I bought it today :D
AustralianMakeup,3b7oaq,SheIsTolerable,2,Sat Jul 4 10:25:57 2015 UTC,"I got a deluxe sample in the most recent loop box. I was really pleasantly surprised by it - it's become my daily primer (on a side note, the sample tube has lasted me over a month, with generous daily application).   I think the primer does a great job at making my skin look and feel smooth, and blurring some of my larger imperfections. I also disliked the veil primer for lack of oil control - I haven't noticed any major issues with shine since using Mecca's primer.  I'll be repurchasing for sure.   I second the other commenter who recommended getting a sample, though! Can't hurt to try it first, and Mecca are great with giving samples."
AustralianMakeup,3b7oaq,Tonkie,2,Fri Jun 26 23:00:17 2015 UTC,"I also got the deluxe sample and I love it. Feels good, nice smell and makes sheer glow go on super smooth.  I have the NARS radiance enhancing primer and I prefer the Mecca, will repurchase.   Also like the price point :)"
AustralianMakeup,3b7oaq,Jessijames,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:32:01 2015 UTC,"I have used a sample of it, for a 'general' primer it's quite nice. The texture and application is really smooth but I don't find it really fills/hides my pores, my makeup help up over it alright but nothing out of this world by the end of an average work day and it didn't really control oil all that much for me. I found it similar in texture and wear to the new-ish Max Factor Facefinity All Day Primer. IMO, not worth the $40 for me personally but if you sample it and it works for you then go for it! it's probably better suited to dry to dry-combo skin rather than oily-combo to oily skins like myself. :)"

There's been a few queries lately about the different palettes.  It's such a shame the Chi Chi palettes can be so hit & miss. If I had the patience right now to figure out how, I would set up a poll or some way for everyone to give the palettes they own ratings so we can collate the average rating out of 10 and have a spreadsheet rating each of the Chi Chi palettes or something for curiosity sake!"

AustralianMakeup,3b5vam,hypothesise,3,Fri Jun 26 05:37:43 2015 UTC,"To be completely honest, I find the packaging really gimmicky - karima from shameless fripperies used to work at Mecca and she said 'The whole Ellis Faas brand is underpinned by the ‘revolutionary’ pen-style delivery system so it’s awkward for me to say this but… it kinda sucks. Back in the day when I used to sell Ellis Faas, the number of people who returned with faulty pens was appalling. 19 clicks dispenses no product but the 20th click spurts out enough for all of Sydney. Never be afraid to return a faulty pen because trust me, THEY ALREADY KNOW.' The formulas, however, seem to get pretty good reviews (as they should considering the price)."

AustralianMakeup,3b5vam,burnt_can,2,Fri Jun 26 08:41:11 2015 UTC,"I've only got the lip pen in the blood red colour. I quite like it - it's a cool design, the colour is easy to build up or apply sparingly as a stain (as I do) and lasts reasonably well with a very natural feel(I can't stand the the feeling of liquid lipsticks on my lips). The only thing I don't like is if I twist too much sometimes the twisty thing has product on it the next time I open, but because the lid creates a tight seal it doesn't dry out and no product is wasted. All over, good product but I'd get the true red colour next time (the blood red colour is a tad too orangey for me)."
AustralianMakeup,3b5vam,criticalenemy,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:48:49 2015 UTC,"EXPENSIVE  The foundation is gorgeous, it looks like you're not wearing makeup, except your skin is perfect. It's $110 though, so it's more of a luxury purchase. I don't regret buying it, but it'll be a while until I repurchase.   I also have the Lights pen in e301, and it's this really stunning pale gold. I don't use it much though, it looks really nice as a thin layer, but a thick layer on the eyelid feels a bit crinkly. It's just a matter of figuring it out, but it really is gorgeous. I think I paid around $52 for mine."
AustralianMakeup,3b5vam,nixedreamer,2,Fri Jun 26 09:08:23 2015 UTC,"It's $110 from Mecca, but $91.30 from Beauty Bay. My absolute perfect foundation regime is to mix Ellis Faas Skin Veil, Giorgio Armani Luminous Silk, and Josie Maran Argan Illuminiser. Looks perf."

AustralianMakeup,3b2xap,SEXPILUS,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:54:56 2015 UTC,Welcome :) I feel like with the inglot concealers (probably with every other kind of cream concealer too) that you need a proper concealer brush to apply and blend it with so don't forget about that! Cause I did hahaha
AustralianMakeup,3b2xap,-eternal_sunshine-,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:10:20 2015 UTC,What's the proper concealer brush again? Haha
AustralianMakeup,3b2xap,yaaaaasbitch,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:32:56 2015 UTC,"Well inglot have the Makeup Brush 22T for concealer, which isn't even the brush that the lady used when she tried the concealers on me but I'm unsure of the one she used. Concealer brushes I think are a bit more dense (correct me if i'm wrong pls!) and they're like smaller more precise foundation brushes! When I can, I will probably buy the concealer brush that real techniques have. I'm probably the worst person to ask about brushes though, I'm currently using an eyeshadow brush for my concealer and then my real techniques stippling brush to blend it out a bit quicker haha!"

I currently only have the nudes chichi palette and a mac quad which i'm not the biggest fan of (I'm very new to makeup and have a tiny collection). In terms of basics, what's the best? I like the look of the starter collection of 9 shades they have, but are there any other recommendations for beginners?"
AustralianMakeup,3avt0w,freezethefire,6,Wed Jun 24 02:16:18 2015 UTC,"I'd look at the top comment here which has a list of all of Temptalia's ratings for various shades.  If you want basic shades you can use for everything, I'd probably recommend (based on Temptalia ratings/other reviews): Peach Smoothie, Cocoa Bear, Latte, Shimma Shimma, Cinderella which covers transition shades, crease shades and lid shades, then possible Bitten, Corrupt and possibly something like Last Dance/Burlesque for a bit of colour? It depends what eyeshadow looks you enjoy but I think a mix of those ones would be a good start :) hope this helps!"

AustralianMakeup,3axu91,misschar,2,Fri Jun 26 10:07:32 2015 UTC,There's Karen Mirrell and some others... you'll generally find NZ stuff in pharmacies.
AustralianMakeup,3axu91,Tuipie,2,Wed Jun 24 22:46:46 2015 UTC,"A good place to try for drug store and high end is Farmers. I know there's quite a decent sized one on Lambton Quay in Wellington - they'll have counter stuff like Napoleon Perdis, Elizabeth Arden, Clinique etc and also Maybelline, L'Oréal... Pharmacies are worth a look for some of the lesser known stuff, and The Warehouse is good for drug store brands too. You might find some random shops walking round Wellington, it's quite an arty city (side note: head to Strawberry Fare for dessert, its delicious!)  I do like Wellington for shopping. Especially shoes. Most of the stores here are going to be similar to Aus - Jeanswest, Temt, Valley Girl etc but Glassons is worth a look as is Farmers and Pagani. Enjoy your trip!"
AustralianMakeup,3axu91,chocfish,2,Thu Jun 25 05:59:44 2015 UTC,"There's not a heck of a lot  of NZ brands that you can't get in Aus. The Karen Murrell lippies are great. Skincare is probably your best bets, makeup wise I cannot think of anything you can't get- and it would be more expensive. Your best bet for shopping will be Wellington, there's not a lot in Napier (but have some wine instead, lots of that, and some good restaurants  like Mister D, Monica Loves, Pacifica just to name a few).  I think just keep your eye out and enjoy!"

AustralianMakeup,3awv6h,mononooke,2,Wed Jun 24 05:19:29 2015 UTC,"I'd honestly never looked on iherb, another commenter linked a brush set on there and I had no idea they were so cheap. I see it mentioned in this sub a bit so I assume they're reliable?"
AustralianMakeup,3awv6h,mononooke,5,Wed Jun 24 05:34:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah they're definitely reliable, not too sure how they have them sooo cheap but they are reliable :) The shipping is super cheap too!"
AustralianMakeup,3awv6h,foxmulders,2,Wed Jun 24 05:44:08 2015 UTC,"If I decide on the RT brush I'll definitely order through iherb. Thank you! I can see myself spending way to much money though, everything is so cheap on that site!"

AustralianMakeup,3awv6h,gospursgo_,3,Wed Jun 24 05:40:22 2015 UTC,"Beauty Blender is just the brand name of a very popular makeup sponge. There are many other makeup sponges that seem pretty good too, like the Real Techniques one."
AustralianMakeup,3awv6h,Artemisian11,2,Wed Jun 24 07:33:58 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm thinking of the RT one since it's cheaper and seeing how that goes and maybe getting the Beauty Blender one.
AustralianMakeup,3awv6h,gospursgo_,3,Wed Jun 24 07:53:51 2015 UTC,I've used both and have come to prefer the RT sponge. My BB got... crumbly? I'm not sure how to describe it. It fell apart after about 6 months of use and weekly washing. My RT one has held up much better. I ordered it from iHerb.

I'll definitely look into that sponge though, I didn't realize they had one."
AustralianMakeup,3awv6h,jamballdonut,2,Wed Jun 24 05:04:34 2015 UTC,Throwing in a vote for a beauty blender. I think the real techniques one is better than the original anyway. Just be sure to wet your sponge before you use it _^
AustralianMakeup,3awv6h,Sleiphy,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:36:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've heard they absorb less product if you wet them first. I'm seriously looking into a beauty blender, I just didn't realize they had so many types. I'm also looking into the real techniques one, thank you."
AustralianMakeup,3awv6h,Sleiphy,2,Wed Jun 24 05:43:00 2015 UTC,I also find that they absorb a lot less if I apply the foundation with a brush or hands first - and then use the sponge just for blending and texture.  Applying product with a sponge I used nearly 3 times as much product :(
AustralianMakeup,3awv6h,Sleiphy,2,Wed Jun 24 06:14:30 2015 UTC,"Yup, I particularly love using it for under eye concealer, it creates a really natural finish. The real techniques sponge is available on iHerb for a fair price, my affiliate link is here for a discount of between $5-$10 on your first order."
AustralianMakeup,3awv6h,Sleiphy,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:09:26 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Yeah under eye is the worst area for the brush to get to, never looks nice and I'm always using my finger anyway."
AustralianMakeup,3awv6h,-SailorMoon-,3,Wed Jun 24 07:54:53 2015 UTC,"I'm currently using and loving the Zoeva Face Shape brush from the rose gold set - it's quite small though so only if you like to take quite a bit of time with your base. Other suggestions are the Real Techniques Buffing Brush and the Zoeva Silk Finish brush (which I actually find is softer than the RT). I have the beautyblender too, and like it, but only for heavier, more full-coverage foundations - it tends to soak up thinner, sheerer formulas."
AustralianMakeup,3awv6h,-SailorMoon-,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:02:00 2015 UTC,"I really like the look of the RT one, or a beauty blender. I've been skeptical about sponges because they soak up so much product. But I do use Studio Fix by MAC which is on the heavier side so I should be okay. Thank you I didn't know it soaked up sheerer formulas."
AustralianMakeup,3awv6h,-SailorMoon-,2,Wed Jun 24 05:27:18 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't find the sponges soak up that much - I use Studio Fix liquid a fair bit, and for comparison I use two squirts of the bottle for full on coverage with the sponge. I could probably get away with one if my skin was clearer, but it is not :("
AustralianMakeup,3awv6h,freezethefire,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:41:14 2015 UTC,"I used to get away with about 1 and a half, now it's 2 minimum. I did start applying my concealer first and found I was using less foundation that way, but it's still habit to do foundation first and I realize afterwards. I haven't used a sponge in years and the ones I was using weren't that great. I'd love to be able to get away with using something with sheer coverage, I'll keep wishing though."
AustralianMakeup,3awv6h,Suriiiiiii,2,Thu Jun 25 14:47:42 2015 UTC,"Yup, I know that wishing feel. If you do want to try a sponge out I recommend the RT one, it's a good starting point (and ending, if it comes to that). So you can see for yourself how much gets soaked and wasted."
AustralianMakeup,3awv6h,Suriiiiiii,2,Thu Jun 25 22:09:10 2015 UTC,"I actually really like the Model's Prefer Airbrush Foundation Brush, which I've heard is similar to the RT one.  Alternatively, I also really like the Chi Chi face sponges (They have 4 different shapes) and they're only $5.95"
AustralianMakeup,3awv6h,Arlibie,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:04:30 2015 UTC,"I'll definitely have a look at that one, I don't tend to browse to much at priceline so I didn't know Models Prefer did brushes. I'll definitely look at those sponges!"
AustralianMakeup,3awv6h,Arlibie,2,Wed Jun 24 05:30:21 2015 UTC,The urban decay optical blurring brush from Mecca has been amazing. A bit pricier than real techniques at $35 but definitely worth it.
AustralianMakeup,3awv6h,NanshyOfficial,2,Wed Jun 24 05:15:18 2015 UTC,"I was just at Mecca and didn't even think to look at Urban Decay. Price isn't a problem, I've spent $50ish the past few times so $35 doesn't bother me if it's good quality."
AustralianMakeup,3awv6h,Arlibie,2,Wed Jun 24 05:31:38 2015 UTC,"They are only at Mecca Cosmetica stores and only have four urban decay brushes I believe. It has synthetic bristles and a sturdy metal handle so is pretty perfect for liquid and cream foundation. The bristles are short, slightly rounded on the edge and dense enough to give a good buffing pressure."
AustralianMakeup,3awv6h,Arlibie,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:34:41 2015 UTC,"I've got a couple Urban Decay brushes, that have come with the Naked Pallets which I've never used. I might give them a try tomorrow and see how they go, I assume all their brushes are about the same quality."
AustralianMakeup,3aty5u,forebary,3,Tue Jun 23 14:11:50 2015 UTC,Looks a lot like Covergirl's Clump Crusher with the way it gives each lash a nice thin coat - I'll definitely be picking this up to try in natural and no-makeup-makeup looks!  I'd love to see more posts about Daiso products. They have so many beauty products and I just never know what I should try.

AustralianMakeup,3aw84w,SchultzAL,8,Wed Jun 24 00:20:43 2015 UTC,"I would recommend that you try out the ""blonde"" pencil from Essence (available at Priceline and Target). It isn't yellow at all, it is a nice neutral shade. For about $2 it is a worth a try! Just put it in the freezer for a bit before sharpening :)"
AustralianMakeup,3aw84w,lady_hazel,3,Wed Jun 24 01:37:34 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your rec. I picked it up and tried it as soon as I got home, and it's exactly what I need. It was $3, and I am very impressed with it."
AustralianMakeup,3aw84w,Shiavo,2,Wed Jun 24 07:19:59 2015 UTC,Thankyou ladies! Going to pick this up tomorrow! Sounds like what I've been looking for :D
AustralianMakeup,3aw84w,lady_hazel,2,Wed Jun 24 16:01:41 2015 UTC,"I am so glad that it works for you! I actually don't use that particular shade myself, but I used it on my cousin for her ball and it was perfect. Their brow gel is pretty good too :)"
AustralianMakeup,3aw84w,MsOrangeCake,2,Fri Jun 26 06:50:28 2015 UTC,I second this. This colour is definitely a nice ash blonde.
AustralianMakeup,3aw84w,Jessijames,2,Wed Jun 24 05:06:26 2015 UTC,Thanks! I picked it up and it's perfect for me. :)
AustralianMakeup,3aw84w,MsOrangeCake,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:20:11 2015 UTC,"Ooh, thanks! I didn't see it at Priceline or I would have bought it when I bought the Savvy one. Will pick it up today!"

Everything I've tried pulls too warm/red and looks horrid. Good luck! Hopefully someone can help you or me or both of us haha"
AustralianMakeup,3aw84w,chillroyale,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:38:54 2015 UTC,I will report back on the Essence shades. :)
AustralianMakeup,3aw84w,originalaliswan,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:15:28 2015 UTC,"Ok, have bought and tested the Essence pencil in blonde, and it is perfect. They have a brown shade that looked very cool toned, as well. For $3.00, it's definitely worth trying if you haven't! :)  I also saw that Chi Chi had a few shades of brown that were cool, if you haven't seen/tried those."
AustralianMakeup,3aw84w,Tomkhagai,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:19:04 2015 UTC,How dark are you looking for? I use the Rimmel brown black pencil and it looks neutral on me.
AustralianMakeup,3aterq,constellationsjr,5,Tue Jun 23 10:46:31 2015 UTC,"I have the Nudes, Rich Gems, and most recently the Elegant palettes, and for the price I think they're alright. The Nudes one is one of the first ""larger"" eyeshadow palettes I've gotten, and I still like using it sometimes. People often compare it to UD's Naked 1, and while the colours are similar, I don't think the quality is quite there. It's still usable though. Rich Gems I have a harder time working with. It's got some pretty colours, but many of them don't look the same in a swatch or on the lid as they do in the pan. I haven't played around with the Elegant palette too much yet, but so far I'm liking it. Lots of purpley shades and the shadow quality seems decent. Overall I do like my Chi Chi palettes. They're not top quality or anything, but in comparing them with other cheaper ones I think they hold up. I find they're a lot more pigmented and blendable than say, the NYX Dreamcatcher palettes for example. I tend not to buy them full price and get them when Target has the 30% off sales."
AustralianMakeup,3aterq,Kateus3000,2,Tue Jun 23 10:59:53 2015 UTC,"In reference to the Rich Gems palette, i find that it works much, much better over a white base (NYX Milk is what i use).   Their shadows are fairly inconsistent. Some of them have good consistency and colour payoff, but some of them are chalky and quite translucent as others have mentioned.  I also have the Oasis palette, which is absolute rubbish. The shadows just vanish on the skin, even with a base or primer. I like the matte, classics, taupes, and bases. From the other palettes i have, i really only cherry-pick a few colours, and leave the rest."
AustralianMakeup,3aterq,toasty_feet,3,Wed Jun 24 04:25:08 2015 UTC,"I have the mattes and I honestly think it's the worst pallette I own. There's no colour pay off at all, chalky quality. Just rubbish. Like you can't even see the shadow when I've put it on.  In saying that I'm curious to try one of the palettes with shimmer as thheir shimmery shadows generally have better pay off."
AustralianMakeup,3aterq,trignometry,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:26:16 2015 UTC,"Funny! I think the shades I use most are one matte that I really like, then a couple of the shimmers that actually have colour payoff (which is seriously like two of them). I'm going to try and time how long they last today too."
AustralianMakeup,3aterq,jamballdonut,4,Wed Jun 24 01:13:10 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly actually not the biggest fan of Chi Chi.  I have around 10 palettes, and some shades in some palettes are pretty good, while the rest of the palette could be utterly terrible.  I find them very powdery, they blend together way too easily, they're not very pigmented, and they're just not very fun to work with.  I never end up reaching for my palettes because they just make me angry, haha  I'd honestly recommend investing in a decent higher end palette (Lorac, Too Faced, Urban Decay) that's going to last you ages and is great quality.  I still haven't found a very good ""cheap"" palette (& I spend a lot of my time reviewing them for fun! haha)"
AustralianMakeup,3aterq,jamballdonut,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:27:24 2015 UTC,"Maybe I ask for one for a birthday, haha... For blonde hair/blue eyes with fair/medium warm complexion - what of the higher end palettes would you recommend? I usually prefer fairly natural/bronzey looks on me."
AustralianMakeup,3aterq,freezethefire,3,Wed Jun 24 01:09:26 2015 UTC,"I'd probably recommend the Lorac Pro (I always recommend that because it's my absolute favvvvvourite) or the Urban Decay Naked 2 (That has quite a few bronze tones, but it does have a loooot of shimmery shades in it)"
AustralianMakeup,3aterq,freezethefire,2,Wed Jun 24 04:59:24 2015 UTC,"Lorac pro! Im blonde with blue eyes and if you like bronzey looks, champagne/light bronze/taupe/sable/espresso/garnet will be your best friends! Taupe and sable especially.... They're just gorgeous. Plus there's a few extra useful/unique shades such as mauve, slate and purple, and the workhorses like cream, white and black. Its a great first foray into higher end makeup and can get it off amazon for like, $60 shipped maybe?"
AustralianMakeup,3aterq,lyzaw,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:33:02 2015 UTC,"So much temptation. Also so much temptation to try another cheapie but Chi Chi has me a bit sceptical of all these ""high quality cheap dupes"" now."
AustralianMakeup,3aterq,jamballdonut,2,Wed Jun 24 23:48:46 2015 UTC,"I understand wanting to try something cheaper, but the standard is nowhere near lorac and its an investment, you can use it for years to come. However, if you aren't that picky formula wise chi chi is good to try out too."
AustralianMakeup,3aterq,Pandarmonium,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:28:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think I'll be leaving Chi Chi well alone after this experience. Unfortunately thanks to me being on unpaid nursing placement full time over the next month my income is going to be dismal. Wah. I'll put Lorac on the ""when I have money"" list."
AustralianMakeup,3aterq,MessyDownunder,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:37:31 2015 UTC,"Just curious, how come you have 10 palettes if you don't like them? Did you buy them all at once, or were you sent them?"
AustralianMakeup,3aterq,SchultzAL,2,Wed Jun 24 01:22:30 2015 UTC,"The first 2 I bought were pretty amazing, and I bought a few more after that (I bought 2 of the duo packs, and the 5 Glamorous Looks to Go) and was given the rest. I also only really played with a few shades, so it wasn't until after I had quite a few of them that I really stuck into them and realised they weren't the best"
AustralianMakeup,3aterq,ellie_girl,3,Wed Jun 24 04:58:06 2015 UTC,"I made this post a couple months ago with swatches and a review on 5 of the Chi Chi Glamorous palettes.  In short, I was pretty impressed with the palettes considering their price point; for the most part, the shadows were fairly pigmented and easy to work with. I haven't, however, tried the palettes you had, so I can't comment on those particular two."
AustralianMakeup,3aterq,Jessijames,3,Tue Jun 23 13:10:20 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge Chi Chi fan, but I think these palettes are among the worst of the brand. I don't understand why they're so popular. I don't mind the OMFG palette, as most of the colours are quite strong, but the others I have are really not pigmented at all."
AustralianMakeup,3aterq,Jessijames,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:37:17 2015 UTC,Any suggestions for better palettes?
AustralianMakeup,3aterq,Jessijames,3,Tue Jun 23 13:49:49 2015 UTC,"I have the Bases, Bronzes, and Taupes palettes and like all 3 of them. I can't say every single shade in all of them is great, but I find that I use these for daily looks more than I use my Naked 2 (so much glitter) or The Balm palettes."
AustralianMakeup,3aterq,Shiavo,2,Wed Jun 24 00:13:15 2015 UTC,I have bases classics and rich gems. I used the first two a lot and maybe two or three shades from ruch gems. I find that the classics pallette the most i find it really good for everyday neutral looks.
AustralianMakeup,3aterq,toasty_feet,2,Tue Jun 23 11:17:07 2015 UTC,"This might be a silly question but are you using a primer/cream base at all? The Chi Chi palettes perform reasonably well over a good primer but act as you've described (colourless shimmer) when used alone with no base from my experience. They do tend to swatch much better than they appear on the lid, but again with a primer it really grips the pigment much better!"
AustralianMakeup,3aterq,duccy_duc,1 point,Tue Jun 23 11:33:14 2015 UTC,Tried with primer/concealer and a light base and none have really made a difference. I find even swatching I get a colourless shimmer with many shades.

AustralianMakeup,3ap2s7,starward-,7,Mon Jun 22 10:09:24 2015 UTC,"Estee Lauder Double Wear foundation, I think it was $55. I really really like it but probably would not repurchase. It's a great long lasting foundation, but not great for every day is it can be really difficult to touch up if a bit wears off. Not a great choice if you have a hot date, and a lady must always be prepared for those."
AustralianMakeup,3ap2s7,pootlepower,3,Mon Jun 22 10:36:58 2015 UTC,"Not a great choice if you have a hot date, and a lady must always be prepared for those   I've always wondered how people have impromptu sleep overs with a full face of makeup just because it feels like it takes me so long to take everything off if I go all out with foundation and stuff haha.  Good to know about the DW though!"
AustralianMakeup,3ap2s7,originalaliswan,3,Mon Jun 22 10:47:25 2015 UTC,"I didn't wear makeup around my boyfriend for the first few weeks for this reason. I'd rather be a plain and basic bitch than carry around makeup remover and co. on a date. I feel awkward taking off makeup/doing pre-bed rituals in front of someone. Or a new someone, at least. Now I'm like meh, you've seen me naked, nothing is awkward now - watch me make my face naked! (Plus, it means I've been comfortable in my own skin around him from the start. Which is awesome!

From memory, it was the best foundation I ever used and I went through 2 bottles of this. Then I discovered the slightly cheaper NARS Sheer Glow, which matched me so much better. And now I use Bourjois. Hah.  My first lipstick ever was Burberry Lip Velvet in Heather Pink, which was a $50 tube of MLBB. It is still barely used since I bought it 3 years ago and a bunch of other lip things have since come and gone. I should stop trying to make lips happen - I only ever use lip balm."

I decided to celebrate my thesis finally being completely done by breaking my no buy a tad although I told myself I would not buy another lip product.

I actually like his better. The handles on his are a little shorter though so if you're going to invest totally watch a bunch of reviews on each kind then decide :)"

I keep hearing amazing things about the touche eclat - is it just the colour match you like about it?
AustralianMakeup,3ap2s7,Stelare,1 point,Mon Jun 22 10:45:55 2015 UTC,"youre not missing out on much, i find myself reaching for my drugstore products way more!  got caught up in ysl rouge volupte lipsticks and they slip and slide everywhere and are useless- so theyre sitting in the bottom of a drawer, along with the glossy stain because i prefer the wear of the loreal version...the touche eclat foundation is useless if youre the slightest bit oily, it slides around everywhere and melts within a few hours, transfers like a mofo BUT it doesnt break me out and matches me. thats literally the only reason i put up with it."

AustralianMakeup,3ap2s7,Tonkie,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:07:18 2015 UTC,I'm the opposite. I got the ysl touche eclat foundation for $82 and the colour match is decent (I've since discovered that I like the Nars All Day Luminous Weightless way more) but I regret it so much because it doesn't last at all on my combination skin! I only ever wear it when I want a really hydrating dewy finish that lasts 2-3 hours.
AustralianMakeup,3ap2s7,Tonkie,3,Mon Jun 22 10:46:45 2015 UTC,"yes! it legit wears for 3-4 hours max when my skin is dry, no matter what primer i use. and it rubs of everywhere. grrr. seriously, you expect way better for that price, but i found Rimmel match perfection looks exactly the same on my skin but wear a bit better...for an eighth of the price!"

I think I paid around $120, with the brush. I think it was originally $80 or $90.

AustralianMakeup,3ap2s7,enthaising,3,Mon Jun 22 11:50:37 2015 UTC,"I have a Guerlain Meteorites Voyage compact ($191) that I absolutely love. I've had it for a couple of years now and there's still plenty of product so I don't think I'll need to repurchase for a while. It's such a lovely finishing powder that lifts any darkness and adds a soft-focus glow and is much, much more travel-friendly than the pearls. The actual compact is just beautiful as well, thinking of just keeping it as a mirror instead of refilling it!  I also have a Chanel Vitalumiere Aqua cream compact ($100), comfortable and hydrating full coverage but still has a dewy finish. Easy to touch up throughout the day since it's a cream foundation but it melts in smoothly without looking cakey. Definitely repurchasing when I run out."
AustralianMakeup,3ap2s7,Suriiiiiii,2,Mon Jun 22 10:55:09 2015 UTC,Wow here I am complaining about my $40 purchase lol. I think it's easy to forget that alot of these products will last for ages so overall the cost isn't as bad as it seems up front. I just googled it and you're right the compact looks really nice!  And ooh this just convinces me more than I need to check out the Chanel counter in the city. Are the assistants quite open to people having a play? I want to be able to compare things first and have a bit of time to look around if I'm spending that much but I'm always worried they'll chase me away.
AustralianMakeup,3ap2s7,Suriiiiiii,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:05:22 2015 UTC,"Oh for sure, I've bought drugstore makeup that I thought was okay and used a couple of times before giving to a friend, and I've always felt more guilty about those than my luxury products that I use all the time.  Definitely! I've found especially with the more luxury brands, they're happy to talk you through the brand and demonstrate products since they've been properly trained and learnt about every product there. That way you can try out the best product for you."

AustralianMakeup,3ap2s7,Suriiiiiii,5,Mon Jun 22 11:51:11 2015 UTC,My YSL lipstick in traditional red - I noticed I didn't have a 'traditional' satin finish red in my collection and when it's a 'staple' I opted to go hard and paid the $55 for it. I don't know if I'll re-buy it because I think it'll take me a long ass time to finish it because a little goes SUCH a long way.
AustralianMakeup,3ap2s7,NotForTheNote,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:21:31 2015 UTC,I organised some of my collection yesterday and it occurred to me I'll probably have to throw out some stuff due to expiration cause there's no way I can finish it all.   How do you like the formula?
AustralianMakeup,3ap2s7,NotForTheNote,3,Mon Jun 22 11:57:05 2015 UTC,So I'm pretty cheap and mine is Hourglass liquid lipstick in Icon. Currently $38 which sounds about what I paid for it. This was the first lip product I ever wore which was completely and utterly infallible (if paired with liner and set with powder). Sounds kinda corny but when I first got it I was amazed that I could have a lipstick that didn't end up everywhere after eating and drinking. I still love it but I'd have to say I prefer my MUFE aqua lips in Burgundy more - I like having the option of the glossy finish and they're both around the same price anyway.
AustralianMakeup,3ap2s7,eekitshoney,1 point,Mon Jun 22 10:14:17 2015 UTC,"Ahhh gotta love a hard-working lip colour! Hourglass seems to have beautiful products, but it doesn't quite feel worth it in the end. My HG primer aka Mineral Veil is really starting to lose its shine, so I think I might start looking for another cheaper yet effective alternative."
AustralianMakeup,3ap2s7,IronicallyNamedCat,1 point,Mon Jun 22 10:50:30 2015 UTC,"it doesn't quite feel worth it in the end   Yeah that's how I feel. It's a great product, but I know I can get something close to it in colour and wear for way cheaper - I mean realistically I can just touch up if I need to, and most of my lipsticks will wear only a few hours less than this one so I wouldn't repurchase even though I really do like the product."
AustralianMakeup,3ap2s7,One_of_a_Kind,1 point,Mon Jun 22 10:55:23 2015 UTC,"Exactly. And there are so many colours to choose from too! I mean, I get it if you only use one shade for the rest of your life, but if you change your shades all the time?  Drugstore and mid-range please!"
AustralianMakeup,3ap2s7,TheyreMineralsMarie1,3,Mon Jun 22 10:59:48 2015 UTC,"The Mac LTD Nordstrom Palette. It is my first ever Mac product! ($130 including postage).  I would say yes its worth it as it has 15 of the best seller eyeshadows in different finishes and the quality is noticeable compared to ""drug store"" brands. I feel like it will last me forever as the shadows dont seem to even look used even though Ive used the palette a lot of times. My runner up items that I love are ANYTHING TOO FACED, the Kat Von D palettes and OCC Lip Tars."
AustralianMakeup,3ap2s7,TheyreMineralsMarie1,2,Mon Jun 22 11:00:42 2015 UTC,Did you order straight from the Nordstrom website or did you use a mail forwarder?
AustralianMakeup,3ap2s7,jamballdonut,3,Tue Jun 23 02:52:02 2015 UTC,I had to use a mail forwarder as that product doesnt ship to Australia. I think that goes for all Mac as its cheaper.
AustralianMakeup,3ap2s7,gospursgo_,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:56:00 2015 UTC,For 15 shadows that actually sounds pretty reasonable! I've never tried MAC but maybe I need to check them out :)  And what's your favourite Too Faced product?
AustralianMakeup,3ap2s7,jamballdonut,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:13:09 2015 UTC,"Yes! I suggest buying Mac from USA and using a forwarding service, its extremely expensive over here and there are many alternatives. I bought Too Faced from Beauty Bay (on sale). My favourite Too Faced product is a tie between the Chocolate bar palette and the Pink Teddy Bear brush set. I find the brushes are the best quality Ive ever used and I like the pale pink colour as well. The Chocolate bar palette didnt interest me at first with all the brown colours but I gave in and purchased it. Ive made some very pretty eye looks with it and I love the actual palette case too."
AustralianMakeup,3ap2s7,gospursgo_,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:43:15 2015 UTC,Agreed about the Chocolate Bar. My lovely mum got me one (I feel so kiddy saying that haha) and although I do find my indie shadows are more pigmented I love using it because it feels really well thought-out and made. Plus I know it's a gimmick but I love the chocolate scent.   Thanks for the tips about MAC! :)
AustralianMakeup,3ap2s7,Jessijames,4,Mon Jun 22 12:51:18 2015 UTC,I dunno if perfume counts but i bought byredo mojave ghost for like.. 160 something bucks which is a lot for me. Had to save for so long.  Damn samples making me realize how nice something is! Also the charlotte tilbury rockstar palette and the rae morris ultimate cheekbone brush.
AustralianMakeup,3ap2s7,Jessijames,6,Mon Jun 22 13:58:58 2015 UTC,Dude. I bought Carnal Flower by Frédéric Malle. It's $370... :/

AustralianMakeup,3ap2s7,chocolatespeckle,2,Mon Jun 22 22:58:43 2015 UTC,"I picked up a Guerlain Meteorites palette from duty free in Singapore, I think it was $95 SGD. It has the pressed Mythic Meteorites Voyage, a blush, and highlighter. I wanted to try it because I kept seeing raves about it on Temptalia and Christine calls it ""real-life Photoshop."" It does look noticeably better than any other setting/finishing powder I've tried (my next favourite would probably be NARS' Soft Velvet Loose Powder in Eden) but I'm not convinced it's sooo much better than other setting powders that it should cost nearly $100."
AustralianMakeup,3ap2s7,chocolatespeckle,2,Mon Jun 22 10:57:06 2015 UTC,Yeah that makes sense. Does it give a blurring effect (sorry I don't actually use photoshop so I'm assuming that's what that means)? At least you can consider it a souvenir from your trip :)
AustralianMakeup,3ap2s7,chocolatespeckle,3,Mon Jun 22 11:00:28 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah I definitely don't regret purchasing it because I would've always wondered about how it would look on me :) and I save it for special occasions, it does feel nice using a pretty product. It sort of does ""Photoshop,"" but for me I feel like it gives a subtle soft focus glow-y effect more than a pore-blurring effect. I can get a smoother surface on my skin with a primer (I'm using the Innoxa Pore Perfecting Vanishing Cream) + Australis' Ready Set Go Finishing Powder underneath any liquid foundation."
AustralianMakeup,3ap2s7,jamballdonut,2,Mon Jun 22 12:23:32 2015 UTC,"Ooh yes I get you. I'm interested to try a product like that, but then again day to day I feel like for me personally it's just not worth it since I don't always do my face. Thanks for the review!"

So I did get a lot but still wanted to mention it. And, I'm not a fan to be honest. It has been sitting in my drawer for so long."
AustralianMakeup,3ap2s7,ningnongnanapants,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:02:40 2015 UTC,Yeah even if it came with alot of product $90 is still alot for something you don't get much use out of!

AustralianMakeup,3ap2s7,ningnongnanapants,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:10:59 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I ended up using one shade of the blush for few weeks but that was it. I couldn't work well with the eyeshadows for some reason. Like they looked pretty in the palette but I don't know, just not my cup of tea. I didn't also take it with me when I was on vacation, it is not very slim and I thought I might as well take one good eyeshadow palette and a small blush and bronzer rather than taking the big thing and not getting satisfactory use out of it."
AustralianMakeup,3ap2s7,gospursgo_,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:27:39 2015 UTC,Yeah I totally get it. Maybe someone on Aussie MUE would get more enjoyment out of it?

I don't mind trying new things. I'm a sucker for pretty packaging though so sometimes I wonder if I buy Chanel for the packaging alone."
AustralianMakeup,3ap2s7,StrattonLove,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:46:55 2015 UTC,I will admit I've definitely bought stuff for the packaging alone! How's the consistency of the shadows? Are they quite soft?

AustralianMakeup,3apg4a,starward-,3,Wed Jun 24 23:37:58 2015 UTC,"Medusas makeup. Beserk is an Australian site that sells them. I bloody love these glitters, I'm seriously contemplating buying their full glitter and shimmer collection for my kit."
AustralianMakeup,3apg4a,starward-,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:44:41 2015 UTC,Oh my god they're so beautiful! Are they duo chrome? A couple look it it.
AustralianMakeup,3apg4a,mononooke,2,Wed Jun 24 23:40:18 2015 UTC,I'm sorry I don't know any good suggestions but make sure you research before purchasing any glitters from online sellers like Etsy - some shops may mark them as eye-safe even though they aren't!
AustralianMakeup,3apg4a,winter_iris,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:20:00 2015 UTC,"thanks for this tip! I'll make sure to check out reviews and stuff, the last thing I'd want is painful glitter in my eyes."
AustralianMakeup,3apg4a,burnt_can,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:44:11 2015 UTC,I believe the TGA (or if not the FDA) should have the size of the glitter particle that is considered safe for eye use - IIRC the size is the most important issue because larger particles can scratch the cornea and lead to permanent damage. Good luck on your search :)
AustralianMakeup,3anezs,ComingUpMilhouse,3,Sun Jun 21 22:52:37 2015 UTC,"I swear by their liquid eyeliner- it's a brush tip type thingy, and none of my friends have ever liked it, but it's amazing to me, super black and doesn't smudge ever."
AustralianMakeup,3anezs,dinosaur_overlord,3,Mon Jun 22 03:16:59 2015 UTC,Myer has 25% off full priced Natio at the moment :)
AustralianMakeup,3anezs,BlackMagic27,5,Mon Jun 22 08:07:28 2015 UTC,"I've used their regular liquid foundations occasionally (not the mineral one) and I think they work well on my skin. Also their translucent powder has lasted a long time and is as good as any other.  I did have a little eyeshadow trio in 'fresh/natural' but I didn't find it super pigmented and it seemed like none of it ever went on.  That being said, I am a mega nail polish snob and I think their polishes are pretty good considering the cost."
AustralianMakeup,3anezs,russellandbear,2,Sun Jun 21 23:34:06 2015 UTC,"I wear a lot of Natio because I have pretty sensitive skin and they're one of the few brands that make things I don't react to.  Best: Invisible Blend Foundation: light coverage, I like how it makes my skin look.  Ageless Illuminating Primer: Don't know if this is exactly illuminating, but it does the job as an everyday primer.  Spa coconut and shea body butter: smells delish. I use it on my legs which dry out from shaving. It's been the best moisturiser for that purpose so far.  My favourite of their products is discontinued. It was a liquid eyeliner pen, but it was thinner than the one they have currently (which is super chunky). It was long lasting, very black and wasn't too thin which I find most liquid pens. I've never found one better, it was so easy to use.   Worst: Blush & Bronze Mineral palate: I decided I loved this and bought TWO... and then realised it was way too glittery, so it can't really be used as a bronzer."
AustralianMakeup,3anezs,colderwater,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:19:32 2015 UTC,"You could still use it as a bronzer as bronzers usually have shimmer or glitter,  however you wouldn't be able to contour with it"
AustralianMakeup,3anezs,Garden1a,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:50:39 2015 UTC,"I feel like it's too much even for bronzer. Shimmer is nice, yes, but this is quite chunky glitter. Even when used sparingly, I've had comments about looking like a disco ball."
AustralianMakeup,3anezs,colderwater,2,Tue Jun 23 06:27:34 2015 UTC,"I love their foaming facial cleanser, toner and moisturizer.  I have normal to dry skin and it makes it look lovely and dewy and smooth without being greasy.    I'm also partial to their chapsticks."
AustralianMakeup,3anezs,PsychoSemantics,2,Mon Jun 22 04:23:10 2015 UTC,"Best:   I love their translucent powder. It sets my BB cream really well and lasts a long time. Their blush is quite nice. I have the apricot/peach colour and it is lovely- pigmented, blendable, not too shimmery. I also love their blush brush. Their lipsticks are beautifully moisturising. My HG every day lipstick is theirs in 'Eden'. Not too pigmented, but very easy to wear. Their smoothie lip crayons are also lovely. Not very pigmented, but leave enough of a stain, and are again very moisturising and easy to wear. I prefer these to other crayons as they don't dry my lips out. I also use their sensitive gel moisturiser every day. It's a nice silicone base so wears well under my makeup, but is still gentle and moisturising enough.   Worst:   Their 'young' range of skin care for sensitive skin is far too scented and irritating. Definitely doesn't match the product description I didn't like their Beauty Blender dupe - the 'complexion perfection sponge'. Absorbed too much product and didn't leave a nice finish."
AustralianMakeup,3anezs,miss_marshwiggle,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:10:37 2015 UTC,Just wanted to add that I've tried the 'young' range as well...I wasn't too bothered by the scent but they just didn't really seem special in any way. Never re-purchased.
AustralianMakeup,3anezs,thexcheshirexcat,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:44:31 2015 UTC,They reminded me of heavily scented clag glue haha.
AustralianMakeup,3anezs,miss_marshwiggle,2,Mon Jun 22 10:47:25 2015 UTC,"I love the mineral foundation. It's only $20 and I find it to be a pretty great dupe for the NARS tinted moisturiser if you have pale skin.  The only thing I don't like is the smell - it's nothing special really, but it's the result of them being fragrance free so I guess it's better for the skin!"
AustralianMakeup,3anezs,The_Sick,2,Mon Jun 22 06:40:27 2015 UTC,"Pure Mineral Foundation-I love this foundation for days that I'm not looking for a ton of coverage. It blends easily, and doesn't go cakey or settle into my fine lines. I set it with a little mineral powder in the t-zone and it lasts all day. I really love it for hot weather.  Nail Colour-This polish comes in some nice colours, but it didn't wear any longer than any other drugstore brands, even with Seche Vite top coat on it.  Rosewater and Chamomile Toner-I used a bottle of this up a few months ago. It smells gorgeous and felt really luxurious to me. I don't think it did much for my skin, positive or negative.   Smoothie Lip Colour-I have 2 of these and love one and hate the other. Petal went on smoothly and gave nice, subtle colour. Poppy went on streaky and looked streaky/uneven, no matter what I did."
AustralianMakeup,3anezs,SchultzAL,2,Mon Jun 22 06:48:52 2015 UTC,"I loved Natio's Lash Definition Mascara, it was the best mascara I'd bought- didn't clump, wasn't too thick, went on well and lasted for ages. It was a very good basic mascara. However I've recently bought a new one because my first tube ran out, and it seems this one is clumping :/ this may be due to it drying out, or a mistake on my end however."
AustralianMakeup,3anezs,graciepoohs,2,Mon Jun 22 06:51:48 2015 UTC,"I love their ""pep up "" body cleanser shower gel it smells delicious and is a hefty size tube for about $12(not on sale)   Also their new candles are really nice, soy, lovely fragrances and a good scent throw, I rarely re-purchase things (always looking for the next best thing :p) but I went back for both of these items.   (Sorry not exclusively make up :) )"
AustralianMakeup,3anezs,Tonkie,2,Mon Jun 22 10:38:12 2015 UTC,I use a fair bit of their skincare. Regularly use their night cream and their Renew SPF 30+ moisturiser. I also really liked their BB cream.
AustralianMakeup,3anezs,Artemisian11,2,Mon Jun 22 22:00:55 2015 UTC,I found that their brow powders are amazing especially for darker brows.
AustralianMakeup,3anezs,lipstickhodor,2,Mon Jun 22 22:35:02 2015 UTC,"I used a Natio Daily Moisturiser (with the Ylang Ylang) and I broke out the day after using it. The smell was really weird and I didn't really like it. Can't say about any other products, though!"
AustralianMakeup,3anezs,manicmoon,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:22:40 2015 UTC,"Best: My favourite blush brush is a Natio one. My partner uses the Foaming Face wash for men- it works with his skin (sensitive/not really too many issues). There was a primer that was ok for a little while on my skin...oh, and there was a toner (again- worked for a little while, then dried my skin out).  Worst: Blush (came out in bumps), hand/body creams (broke out),"
AustralianMakeup,3anezs,jaded_elf,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:41:06 2015 UTC,"I've been to a few of the Natio warehouse sales, so I've collected a few bits and pieces.  I love the lipsticks, they're not drying at all and the colours are really wearable. 'Sienna' is my favourite for work.  I have a baked eyeshadow trio and another regular trio. Again, nice for work. And by that I mean that they are quite subtle. They apply smoothly, just not super pigmented.  The toner works well enough as far as I can tell, but I didn't use one before getting it, so I don't have much to compare it to.   I think my most-used item has got to be the blush in 'peach glow'. I use it as an alternative to Candid Coral (elf) when I want a little more colour. It seems to go with pretty much everything. I also have another, slightly more mauve shade that applies beautifully as well. They're a tiny bit shimmery, but I quite like the glowy look."
AustralianMakeup,3anezs,thexcheshirexcat,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:41:26 2015 UTC,"Best: translucent powder. Haven't used it in years, but I did like it.   Nail polishes weren't bad but I don't know enough about nail polish to give a good review.  Lip Smoothie Crayons - these are awesome. I have a NYX one and it dries my lips out but these ones are super moisturising and leave a good stain behind. Love.   Worst - their makeup sponge. I need to buy a new (different) one. Very hard and difficult to clean, not soft or absorbent like a Beauty Blender is meant to be.   Unsure - Renew exfoliator. Says it has ahas and bhas but I'm not sure it did much? Good to use while I waited for Stridex to arrive."

I always break out and go horribly dry, whether it be blush, powder, foundation, skincare...everything. It's nuts. I won't go near Natio these days."

AustralianMakeup,3ao1r3,gospursgo_,5,Mon Jun 22 02:26:30 2015 UTC,"why don't you look into buying a separate banana powder and contour colour instead of getting a palette? like you said, if you're only planning on using 2 or 3 colours it seems kinda a waste to get a whole palette."

AustralianMakeup,3ao1r3,ladyhellcat,2,Mon Jun 22 05:16:44 2015 UTC,"MAC has their new Prep&Prime CC line out they are available as a liquid, loose powder or pressed powder and there is a yellow shade (at update the yellow powder was actually explained as being our answer to the Ben Nye Banana powder)   Our Matte Bronze bronzer is also a great contouring shade (cooler toned brown) if you have a fair to medium skin tone, it's nice and sheer/build-able so you don't get that insane chunk of brown on your face like you do with the Australis one (I have it too and the first time I used it was nothing short of horrifying/hilarious!). Definitely go into a store if you have one nearby to have a swatch and play with both :)"
AustralianMakeup,3ao1r3,SchultzAL,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:52:28 2015 UTC,"oooooh, this is awesome, i am aware of the cc line and considered the purple powder! but it never crossed my mind to utilise the yellow one for under the eye. are they quite matte? from a studio fix thickness to a blot dryness how would you rate them? are they pigmented?

AustralianMakeup,3ao1r3,SchultzAL,2,Mon Jun 22 05:18:41 2015 UTC,"Ahh no worries! Here to help :) Texture/thickness wise they're about the same as the regular Translucent powder - very finely milled but they are matte, so no super fine shimmer which the translucent has. I don't know how they rate in pigmentation compared to the Ben Nye powder as I haven't tried it, but they are fairly sheer  Some swatches I found around the innernets   here  here  and here"

I think part of it is our fault (as the consumer), swatching things with our grubby fingers. I mean, the Hourglass displays are always so dirty because the powder is so soft, it flies everywhere.  Well, I'm gonna make a confession. Recently, I went to a Mecca to swatch a lipstick on the back of my hand and uh... part of the lipstick bullet fell off. Oops. I started panicking, and it was a busy day so no one noticed. My friend took that bit of lipstick off me and put it to the side of the display, and we snuck away like we were never there.

I have found that my Lush moisturiser with essential oils in it doesn't work under any of my foundations, as it separates and looks weird, no matter how long I wait after applying the moisturiser.  Silicones aren't absorbed, but sit on the skin to create a smooth surface.  The best moisturiser I've found (for me) for wearing under most foundations is Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturising Gel. I have that Hydro-Boost Water Gel and will try it out sometime this week."
AustralianMakeup,3ansmc,SchultzAL,2,Mon Jun 22 01:37:15 2015 UTC,Oh. Maybe I should experiment. I think it's cause I don't pay too much attention to the moisturiser.
AustralianMakeup,3ansmc,mononooke,2,Mon Jun 22 02:49:58 2015 UTC,I see so many people rave on about that Clinique moisturiser! I need it! If only I wasn't on a budget :(
AustralianMakeup,3ansmc,Artemisian11,2,Mon Jun 22 06:52:31 2015 UTC,"I feel really basic on this, but I just use pretty standard moisturisers and it works fine? I use Dermaveen body lotion straight after toning, and Natio SPF 30+ moisturiser after that, 10 minutes before makeup. I'm super super dry, so I moisturiser like a demon :("
AustralianMakeup,3ansmc,elfies_,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:30:06 2015 UTC,"it definitely does matter, but i reckon it's also case by case. i've used oils as moisturiser and i find that if i just wait a little for it to dry down before using a silicone based primer, the primer goes on just fine. the only silicone primer i've really had issues with is bareminerals prime time which just did not want to work with my moisturisers :/ i also feel like this question might be better posted in /r/skincareaddiction or /r/AusSkincare if you're looking for moisturisers :)"
AustralianMakeup,3akjr3,manicmoon,6,Sun Jun 21 02:40:19 2015 UTC,"every single shade looks good on you. Carolina Coast is to die for, and your lips are amazing!  can you give a mini summary of how they wear or feel- compared to other crayons like revlon? thanks!"
AustralianMakeup,3akjr3,gospursgo_,2,Sun Jun 21 04:30:49 2015 UTC,"Ah thank you!!   They aren't very moisturising, but they aren't too drying either. I've tried wearing lip balm under it but the crayon won't apply over my lips very well, so I have to moisturise my lip balm the night before to prep for it. They feel creamy on the lips and wear pretty well if you're not eating greasy foods. I don't wear any lip liner or lip primers so that may be the reason why it doesn't last as long as other people say (on /r/makeupaddiction). I have a couple Revlon Colorburst matte Balms, and they are pretty similar except the Revlon balm glide on a bit more smoothly than the Burts bees crayons."

AustralianMakeup,3akjr3,Artemisian11,2,Sun Jun 21 04:37:06 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I've been comfortable using lipsticks that match my lip colour, but haven't found the courage to wear lighter coloured lipsticks out yet. I might give it a go eventually though, since Sedona Sands is a lovely colour!"

AustralianMakeup,3akjr3,constellationsjr,3,Sun Jun 21 03:58:50 2015 UTC,"They're very pigmented and can be comparable to the Revlon Colorburst Matte balms, but they're a bit more drying and can drag a tiny bit on application. Definitely not as drying as liquid lipsticks like Velourlips, though. I've honestly only worn them out a few times at most, and I've found that it doesn't last after eating, so I need to re-apply it after. If I'm not eating any food, it holds up pretty well! These are actually the first lip products I've bought (new to makeup) and I'm definitely happy with my purchase!"
AustralianMakeup,3alldm,katelynrose25,1 point,Sun Jun 21 12:18:38 2015 UTC,"I use Studio Fix and LOVE it, I've got a few other people onto it as well. I'm super pale, with normal skin and I prefer full coverage. If that helps as anything to go by? When I went into MAC the girl asked me a bunch of questions, like what primer I used, what kind of coverage I want, how my skin is and such and she chose Studio Fix for me. Definitely talk to the sales person and they'll make the best recommendation for you. Don't stress about colour matching, they'll do all that for you.    I use Studio Fix NC15 in liquid and powder and the Prolongwear concealer that's in a mini pump bottle. Love this concealer but it can be a real prick to get product out of. I'm on my second bottle and I can't easily get the last third of the product out of easy. So if your in the market for concealer beware of that bottle. If you decide to get Studio Fix foundation DEFINITELY get the pump that goes with it. Makes life soooo much easier."

If you try it on instore, go outside and check the colour in natural light (the lighting is terrible in both Myer and DJs).   Also I would recommend checking out Inglot whilst you are there if you don't have one near you."

AustralianMakeup,3al5rk,whinge_chime,3,Sun Jun 21 10:46:25 2015 UTC,"Haha man, I've tried so many different lip balms throughout my life. The only things that have worked amazingly well for me are:   Dermal Therapy Lip Balm (seriously my HG lip balm, I have never found anything as good as this ever) Lanolips Lansinoh (same as Lanolips except cheaper. You can buy it at iHerb!) Nivea Lip Butter in the tin La Roche Posay Cicaplast Baume B5  Maybelline Baby Lips (my go to for the last couple years 'til I found Dermal Therapy)   Things that don't work for me:   Blistex, Chapstick (it makes my lips feel warm and... does nothing else) Burt's Bees (irritating ingredients! Love the minty feeling it gives out, but does nothing for my dry lips) Vaseline (or basically anything that is just an occlusive doesn't work on my dry lips)   And of course the most important ingredient to prevent dry lips in the first place is good old H2O!"
AustralianMakeup,3al5rk,starward-,3,Sun Jun 21 14:08:26 2015 UTC,Oralife! Please buy it. I had the worst cracked dry burning lips for YEARS and it fixed them overnight.
AustralianMakeup,3al5rk,Pandarmonium,2,Sun Jun 21 17:12:17 2015 UTC,"I second the gently exfoliating your lips when brushing your teeth, works wonders. That and my Burt's Bees lip balm keep my lips nice and soft."
AustralianMakeup,3al5rk,treecosy,2,Sun Jun 21 12:12:10 2015 UTC,"I have found the toothbrush thing a bit too harsh for my lips, but rubbing gently with a damp towel or cloth after a shower works wonders. Alternatively I slather with balm and do the same but of course YMMV.  I don't spend a ton of money on balms, but I think it helps to be really regimented with it. If you wear lipstick out all day then make sure as your lipstick goes off your balm goes on and reapply as necessary every night. If your lips are super dry wearing a tinted balm during the day can also help instead of wearing a lipstick which can be drying.   Hope that helps!"
AustralianMakeup,3al5rk,hunting-the-snark,2,Sun Jun 21 12:16:28 2015 UTC,"As someone who wears a lot of liquid lipstick, lip care is pretty important to me - there'll often be at least 3 lip products in my handbag at any given time!  For lip exfoliation, I swear by Lush's Bubblegum Lip Scrub, which you can pick up for about 13 bucks. It's made from natural ingredients and includes Jojoba oil, so it's hydrating as well as exfoliating. I use the scrub daily in the shower and then rub my lips gently with a towel to make sure I've gotten off all the dead skin. The e.l.f. Studio Lip Exfoliator is a cheaper alternative (and in a convenient lipstick tube), but the product works best if you warm it up slightly in the microwave and you already have a layer of thick lipbalm (as mentioned below) on your lips to act as a base; so it's a bit of extra work.  After exfoliation, I immediately lather on Vaseline's Lip Therapy in Cocoa to lock in the moisture. I'll also put on a generous layer of this before bed. Paw Paw Ointment is a good substitute as well for a thick and moisture rich lipbalm.  For day to day use while I'm out and about, I like the EOS lipbalms (especially the Coconut Milk and Vanilla Mint flavours, but they are all good). I've also heard that the Maybelline Baby Lips are great, but I'm yet to try them. Also, if you have broken, cracked skin on your lips or ulcers/blisters, I recommend Carmex to help clear that up."
AustralianMakeup,3al5rk,HRM_Monster,2,Sun Jun 21 14:49:45 2015 UTC,"Check you out, awesome! You see I didn't even know you could really buy exfoliators for lips. Great tips, let's see how I go with all these."
AustralianMakeup,3al5rk,milkiebuttle,2,Mon Jun 22 08:45:02 2015 UTC,"I also have terrible, horrible, split-open-and-bleed-everywhere lips, especially during the winter. I've tried everything; Burt's Bee's, Baby Lips, paw paw ointment, medicated chapstick etc etc. I've finally found what works best for me is a combination of exfoliation using the Lush lip scrub and following up with Nuxe Reve de Miel. The latter is kind of waxy and needs to be warmed up and worked into the skin (after exfoliation only, it won't do anything on top of dead flaky bits) but holy bananas it worked absolute miracles.  If you're not keen on spending $20 I would also recommend the Dermal lip balm which is something like $5 or less at Priceline and also works quite well."

I don't really rate them for blending after using Zoeva/Nars etc. but they're great for beginners and the shadow/crease brushes can also be used for concealer.

AustralianMakeup,3aiblz,louise_sophie,2,Sat Jun 20 21:18:10 2015 UTC,"I would suggest getting the sculpting set actually. You get 3 brushes for price of 2 and the setting brush by RT is the best thing. I mainly use it for setting my undereye concealer and applying highlighter. But it can also be used for blush and bronzer. Also a very good one to throw in your bag for touch-ups during the day (rather than powdering the whole face again you can just powder the oily areas (in my case, my T-zone)! And while the sculpting brush is not as precise as a flat contour brush, it is very dense and will make the blending so much easier. Can't say anything about the fan brush that comes in the set though since I don't have it."

So much good stuff this time around yet again, and I think I have a found a ""close-enough"" dupe for the NARS Kauai eyeshadow duo I have lusted after for like a year now...BONUS!!!  I was also super shocked they had the Max Faxtor Creme Puff powders since they're fairly new, $5 each they were but they only had 2 shades.   All of this cost me $42 - luckily the lady at the register only charged me $2 for erach of the CG polishes when they were supposed to be $3.

AustralianMakeup,3addd2,NikohlRose,2,Fri Jun 19 05:02:53 2015 UTC,Derma Sukin is the bomb. I use the oily skin version of that cleanser as a body wash and on my face and it's a godsend. It's still so gentle but not at all stripping considering it a product targeted for 'oily skin' and you're right about it lasting forever - the price makes this so worth it!   & boo to you for being able to find that Essence highlighter ;) It's always sold out when I hit up an Essence stand -.- haha
AustralianMakeup,3addd2,Jessijames,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:20:47 2015 UTC,"Oh it's just such an amazing cleanser! I have really sensitive skin and this is the first cleanser that I've used that doesn't make me go super red after using it- it's definitely a good buy!   Hahaha, this was actually the last one there so I'm feeling pretty lucky tbh :P"
AustralianMakeup,3addd2,turtleonitsback1,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:24:21 2015 UTC,I also use that cleanser! It's amazing on my sensitive skin!
AustralianMakeup,3addd2,WarlockPanda,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:05:10 2015 UTC,"I would be happy to look around for the essence highlighter, if you'd like. I'm pretty sure I saw it at my local just recently."
AustralianMakeup,3addd2,WarlockPanda,2,Fri Jun 19 08:03:01 2015 UTC,"**UPDATE   I just tried on the Rimmel Lasting Finish foundation, the Essence So Glow highlighter, and the Physicians Formula Liquid Liner!    So the foundation is a tad too light on my face, but that's not a big deal because I can bronze it up if I need to.   It's definitely a sheer foundation and it doesn't cover up the redness on my nose very well, however it's a buildable foundation so I was able to go over the redder areas until I had gotten a more  medium coverage.   It feels very nice on and it doesn't cling to any dry areas, however it does make the little papules on my nose and chin stand out if you look closely.   I applied it with a blending sponge and washed and moisturised my face prior to application.     The Essence Highlighter is really, really nice on. At first it was a little tricky to apply properly because I was sweeping it on with my finger, however it works a lot better if you sort of 'stipple' it on with your finger instead.   It's very luminous and looks fantastic- not too glittery, just the perfect amount of shine.     The Physicians Formula Eyeliner is very nice. I'm used to using the Maybelline Master Precise Liquid Liner and really, there's no comparison.   It is very easy to use  and I was able to successfully do a full set of cat eyes very quickly without any trouble. The shade that I have (Ultra Black) is definitely a true black.   It glides on the skin perfectly with great accuracy, which is everything that you need in a liquid eyeliner.  I'm actually a little disappointed that I love it so much because now I'll have to keep buying it!"
AustralianMakeup,3addd2,WarlockPanda,1 point,Fri Jun 19 06:22:04 2015 UTC,"If you have sensitive skin, be careful with the physicians formula eyeliner. I used to use it before switching to the Maybelline Master Precise liquid liner pen. It caused my eyelids to break out in hives. Literally just where I used the liner. I think it was from the ""lash boost"" ingredient. If anyone does pick it up I would definitely suggest patch testing if you are prone to allergies."
AustralianMakeup,3addd2,pumpkinspicevodka,2,Fri Jun 19 07:30:25 2015 UTC,I've had it on for the past few hours and nothing has happened so far... how long did it take for you to break out in hives?
AustralianMakeup,3addd2,WarlockPanda,1 point,Fri Jun 19 07:34:45 2015 UTC,Days before I started noticing it. It was a tad itchy at first. I have very sensitive skin and many allergies though. If you don't have many allergies you'll be fine.
AustralianMakeup,3addd2,starward-,2,Fri Jun 19 07:37:55 2015 UTC,"I'll have to just be mindful of it then, thanks for letting me know! I only have an allergy to bees and eggs so I should be okay :)"

As I was leaving Kit (in Myer) I saw the Chanel Lumiere D'ete bronzer  but the sales assistant took like 5 minutes to explain how it was limited edition (meaning it wont be restocked, they only have limited stock, and once its sold out they wont be getting it back in stock - who doesn't love a patronising sales assistant) so I decided to buy it in David Jones. And then I got the nars pro prime because my eyes are an oasis in the desert that is my face."
AustralianMakeup,3aacy2,WarlockPanda,3,Thu Jun 18 14:17:37 2015 UTC,"That Chanel bronzer is really pretty. Also I love the smudge proof eye base.

AustralianMakeup,3ad05k,dunziniaa,5,Fri Jun 19 02:48:17 2015 UTC,"Theoretically, if your primer is water-based and your foundation is silicone-based you shouldn't use them together or your foundation could 'pill'. However, I think the best thing to do (since you already have both products) is to just try the combination! Wear it around the house if you don't want to risk experimenting in public. Examine your face (best in natural light) using a magnifying mirror - does it emphasise pores/lines/etc? Does it look cakey/uneven? How long did your foundation last? You should be able to form an opinion on how it looks at the end of the day - you could even ask a friend (who sees you regularly with your makeup on) how it looks compares to your usual makeup! Personally, if I put on makeup it'll be in the morning when my sleepy brain doesn't give a fuck about silicone/water/anything so I just stick to what I know. Primer suggestions for dry skin: hourglass primer serum if you're willing to shell out the monetary equivalent to your first born child or Nivea Post Shave Balm has been raved about (see NikkieTutorials' channel on youtube & here) a lot recently."
AustralianMakeup,3ad05k,-eternal_sunshine-,3,Fri Jun 19 04:04:05 2015 UTC,"I tried the Nivea Post Shave Balm (the sensitive skin one) after hearing Nikkie rave about it and I love it. My foundation last really well - even after a 10 hour shift behind the bar with god-knows-what liquids being splashed on me. I've found it works equally well with both silicone-based and water-based foundations.   I actually find it fairly similar to the hourglass primer, just a little thicker in consistency.  You do have to be careful not to rub it on too much on application. I'd also suggest leaving it to set for about a minute after applying the balm. I find patting and gently smoothing it on with my fingers or patting it on with a beauty blender work best.   If you're sensitive to smells though this is heavily fragranced and smells like a man. However, the sent doesn't linger and by the time I've finished applying my makeup it no longer smells.    The best bit is that it was $9.95 for 100ml.   EDIT: Just thought I'd add that I have dry skin. However, my sister who has oily skin also loves it and says it stops her foundation from separating around her T-Zone."
AustralianMakeup,3ad05k,mustuseallthegifs,1 point,Fri Jun 19 06:30:43 2015 UTC,"Yep, I've also used the Nivea Post Shave Balm (I was one of the people raving about it in the thread linked) & it is amazing.  I have very oily, but dehydrated skin, and it just adds in hydration that no other moisturiser can.  (Although that's probably because it has such a high amount of glycerine in it)"

AustralianMakeup,3a9to0,pynkbunny,2,Thu Jun 18 19:46:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the review, I'm super interested in getting that bag now haha. By the way, I think the reason why the total was $385 instead of $400 was because of your missing Burt's Bees lip balm, total bummer. :/"

I liked how you broke them down to individual categories and listed the price as well so that it's easier to decide. The only differences I can see are the Palmers lotion flavour (if we can call that a flavour for a lotion), the PawPaw and the swisspers obviously. I'm quite surprised you didn't get the Burt's Bees lip balm though. And there seems to be nothing else from the brand!   Edit: I just realized I didn't get anything from Nuxe though!  And, the Antipodes serum is $60???For such small bottle? I might not look at it the same way now 😉."

AustralianMakeup,3a9to0,cheeseandwine,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:10:20 2015 UTC,Ya there were some different contents in different bags. I also preferred the ones in our bags rather than others. We were lucky :D. Maybe give the stuff that doesn't suit you to your friends if they like it? I also have same problem with some of the stuff.
AustralianMakeup,3a9to0,Crumpet92,3,Sun Jun 21 05:22:56 2015 UTC,"I went in and got my bag today and I gotta say, it was heavy! Amazing value and lots of new goodies to try :)"
AustralianMakeup,3a9to0,Crumpet92,2,Thu Jun 18 13:00:41 2015 UTC,"Ya, it's so heavy. You know the moment I picked it up, I was like ""Yay, Yay"" inside because it was heavy and that meant loads of goodies 😁!"
AustralianMakeup,3a9to0,prettyreckless11,3,Thu Jun 18 22:06:06 2015 UTC,"I love my bag! its so heavy and when I was pulling items out, it just kept going. Such a good opportunity to try new products. I took mine back to the office and my boss saw it and then other females clued on and all got excited and went out to get one too."
AustralianMakeup,3a9kgy,Tonkie,10,Thu Jun 18 08:45:44 2015 UTC,"New favourite thing - using a highlighter! Ok I know I'm probably way late on this train but I never used to bother with face makeup and now I'm slowly becoming a blush/highlighter junkie.   I really like using my indie shadows as highlighters (I just mentioned this in another thread) and Alkahestry from Shiro is my product of choice right now because of the subtle blue/purple sparkle it gives. I do have some TKB powders on the way though thanks to another awesome Redditor and I am really excited to try the hilite pigments as highlighters!  I should note, I am NC40 so it's probably easier for me to get away with crazier colours on my face since they don't show up as noticeably as they would on a paler skin tone.  Edit cause I forgot a word"
AustralianMakeup,3a9kgy,starward-,2,Thu Jun 18 08:52:10 2015 UTC,"Alkahestry from Shiro   Woah I just googled that and I can imagine it looks stunning as a cheek highlight! Wow! Do you have a photo of it on that you're comfortable sharing? :)  Highlighter is probably the newest thing I've started doing as well. I have been looooving my Mary Loumanizer from theBalm. So so stunning. I wore it for the first time last Saturday and I may or may not have sent snapchats of my cheekbones to all my friends and captioned them ""dat glow"" haha. I have no shame. I am also on a serious blush kick!"
AustralianMakeup,3a9kgy,chocolatespeckle,2,Thu Jun 18 09:18:33 2015 UTC,"I would love to send you a photo but honestly when I tried taking one the shift didn't show up at all. I think maybe if I had my face at some weird angle to the light it might help? I might ask my SO to help me take some photos this weekend and if I get one I will let you know! But it definitely looks way less weird than I thought it would, and it's much more of a subtle but pretty effect. My tip would be to apply with a very light hand though, because it's loose it's really easy to grab a crap ton on your brush by accident. And I've stuck to sheerer colours whenever I'm trying an eyeshadow as highlighter which I think has helped in blending!  If you wanted to try a more subtle but slightly weird eyeshadow look, my tip would be to mix it in with a light/peachy blush or with your Mary Loumanizer (I don't know well this blends with other powders?). I mixed some Alkahestry in with a peach blush I have and it seriously made me feel like a fairy princess haha.   I totally understand the snap chat thing too, except I take it even further and get all up in people's faces irl and be like loooook, isn't this duochrome awesome??   Also sorry that was probably way more info than you were expecting but it's something I'm just really enjoying at the moment :)"
AustralianMakeup,3a9kgy,starward-,1 point,Thu Jun 18 09:28:29 2015 UTC,"Haha yes I think your face has to be at a weird angle to show it off, which is why I used snapchat to send it... XD Yeah I guess it seems scary cos I'm picturing the shadows as opaque on your cheek, even though obviously you're using them very subtly.   Oh that's such a good idea! I have a halfling of HW's finishing powder which I don't love as a finishing powder because it's a bit too sparkly for my liking, but I've been planning to use it as a way to tone down super pigmented blushes and make them easier for me to apply. May have to do that with shadows for a highlight too :)   Noo don't apologise! I love getting replies. My friends aren't really into makeup so much, so I rely on this sub to get my makeup fix. I've even been kind of considering starting an instagram or something just so I can interact with some of you over there as well. With pictures too!"
AustralianMakeup,3a9kgy,chocolatespeckle,2,Thu Jun 18 09:46:47 2015 UTC,"Dooooo it!! (The instagram I mean). If you do join, let me know your username (if you prefer to remain private, PM me!) I love seeing people's looks in a totally stalkerish way. Plus /u/sarkata and I do weird lipstick Friday which is really fun :)  And yeah the HW sounds perfect for that!! Definitely use small amounts of shadow, I promise I'm not walking around with opaque purple streaks on my face haha  Actually if I can rec something else, RT's expert face brush is the shit. It's so good at blending stuff out, previously I was finding I hated the look of foundation on my face but if I apply with my RT sponge then blend after whatever other products I'm using go on in Goss style my skin looks so much better and everything looks well blended instead of having lines of product across my face!  And same here!! Reddit is the only place I really get to talk about makeup without people getting bored. Although when I started my blog one of my male friends read it to support me and now when I see him he'll try to ask me about what shadow I'm wearing or something which is really sweet of him even if he has no idea what he's saying haha"
AustralianMakeup,3a9kgy,starward-,2,Thu Jun 18 10:35:11 2015 UTC,"Haha okay. I can't decide if I want to share my face on the internet yet. But I will let you know! :)  I actually got the expert face brush in my iHerb order!! I've been liking the buffing brush for foundation so picked up the expert face to compare, and because I'm lazy and thought it'd be good to have another brush in my rotation lol. So are you using the expert face brush to buff powder on? Cos I still haven't tried that technique but will have to give it a go.  Aw that is really sweet! Yeah when my sister first started her nail blog years ago it was pretty much just me reading. I don't like doing my nails but I always try to show an interest even if I don't know what I'm talking about :P"
AustralianMakeup,3a9kgy,chocolatespeckle,2,Thu Jun 18 15:51:14 2015 UTC,"Ok I'm probably not using it right, but I use it just to blend everything in after I've applied. I think I saw it on MUA but IIRC it was Wayne Goss who had that tip about super blending everything in, and honestly for me it works really really well with this brush.   And re Insta, I actually never post my face either so you'd be in good company :) Not trying to pressure you at all though!"
AustralianMakeup,3a9kgy,starward-,2,Thu Jun 18 16:06:15 2015 UTC,"Ah yes I think his technique is to buff powder onto the skin in order to super blend everything in and create a really flawless look. I will give it a go, thanks!  Fineeee I'll get onto it once exams are over! Reddit is enough distraction for now lol. :3"
AustralianMakeup,3a9kgy,chocolatespeckle,2,Thu Jun 18 16:19:30 2015 UTC,"Ah sorry I'm a bit sleep deprived and clearly sounding like an idiot so I should explain, I'm applying finishing powder first! I'm just using this brush to blend it all in :)   And good luck with your exams!!"
AustralianMakeup,3a9kgy,starward-,2,Thu Jun 18 16:23:05 2015 UTC,Ohhh haha I thought you were just using the brush to go over your face without any powder! It all makes much more sense now. I've seen you working super hard over at IMAM with all your mod duties! I think we both need sleep :)  Thank you!
AustralianMakeup,3a9kgy,chocolatespeckle,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:26:06 2015 UTC,"I really like using my indie shadows as highlighters (I just mentioned this in another thread) and Alkahestry from Shiro is my product of choice right now because of the subtle blue/purple sparkle it gives   I have this shadow, and I think I'll give it a go as a highlighter sometime to see how it wears on my skin tone. This sounds lovely!  Do you match it with a specific blush?"
AustralianMakeup,3a9kgy,WarlockPanda,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:28:27 2015 UTC,"Actually because I'm lazy most of the time I don't wear both blush and highlighter together. I know that's really terrible but I am trying to get more into doing full face looks! But if you have any peachy blush I think it works really well Alkahestry. Specifically, I love the combination of Inu from Hello Waffle and Alkahestry together!"
AustralianMakeup,3a9kgy,starward-,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:37:44 2015 UTC,It just occurred to me that Moon Prism Power would also make a lovely highlight with a gentle hand! I'm going to try it out on the weekend.
AustralianMakeup,3a9kgy,WarlockPanda,5,Thu Jun 18 20:49:09 2015 UTC,"Z Palettes! I have a mental block where I can only use one palette per look, and I need to have a mix of matte and shimmer shades. I had 2 palettes I never used because they were either one or the other, but not both (Wet N Wild Comfort Zone and ChiChi Mattes). I depotted them and combined them in a homemade Z palette and they work awesomely together. The softer Wet N Wild shadows made the ChiChi ones blend easier too. 10/10 would risk ruining shadows again."
AustralianMakeup,3a9kgy,pootlepower,4,Thu Jun 18 10:47:42 2015 UTC,"My new favourite thing is red eyeshadow. I seriously don't know what possessed me to try it but I did, expecting to have to take it off immediately, and I ended up loving it and immediately going out to buy a proper red eyeshadow from inglot!  I also got my first Jeffree Star Cosmetics velour liquid lipstick in Unicorn Blood because I wanted to try one before I got my hopes up about the shades of blue they're releasing, and now I'm just super excited for the blues and allowing myself to celebrate my new job by planning to buy...at least two of them."
AustralianMakeup,3a9kgy,sarkata,2,Thu Jun 18 11:45:17 2015 UTC,Yes to the red eyeshadow. Thought I would hate it. It's my favourite colour for shadows now!
AustralianMakeup,3a9kgy,starward-,2,Thu Jun 18 11:57:54 2015 UTC,I'm dying to buy a red eyeshadow and a gold/copper eyeshadow!  Do you have the name or number or anything of the red one you bought?
AustralianMakeup,3a9kgy,DAT_CANKLE,2,Thu Jun 18 13:44:29 2015 UTC,"If you're game for loose eyeshadows, indie brands like Fyrinnae, Femme Fatale and Hello Waffle do excellent reds!"
AustralianMakeup,3a9kgy,pondicus,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:43:10 2015 UTC,"I love red eye-shadows as well! When used appropriately, they make a great transition colour. I bought red brick from Mac :) a little more on the orange side but so nice!"

AustralianMakeup,3a9kgy,duccy_duc,2,Sat Jun 20 07:56:46 2015 UTC,I picked up some new brushes lately and I'm really loving them.  One of them is the RT Silicone liner brush and the others are actually some RT dupes which turned out to be really soft and fluffy!
AustralianMakeup,3a9kgy,Flippantry,2,Thu Jun 18 08:54:17 2015 UTC,New brushes are so exciting! What are the RT dupes that you bought? My iHerb order arrived yesterday and I can't wait to play with the new sculpting brush and fan brush I got. Also picked up the RT BB dupe so will compare those as well. I'm really hoping I like it as much as the BB because it's so much cheaper!
AustralianMakeup,3a9kgy,chocolatespeckle,3,Thu Jun 18 09:23:14 2015 UTC,"They're these ones, I thought I'd give them a try since the last time I'd bought an RT brush it didn't work out so well for me so I wasn't ready to drop $10+ on a single brush.  I was looking to try a buffing brush and I was really surprised with how well this one worked.  I ended up getting #2, #3 and #6 in the end!    The silicone liner is pretty uniquer though so I just nabbed that from iHerb, it's great! It's so much fun to play with new brushes! :D   I have the RT sponge too, I really like it.  I haven't tried the BB (because damn, that price) but I was really impressed with the RT one.  I've tried a few other random sponges but they never absorbed or changed much in size/density but the RT one goes so big and puffy and fluffy!  I've read a lot of mixed reviews about it but personally I think it's awesome! Let me know how it compares to the BB!"
AustralianMakeup,3a9kgy,Flippantry,2,Thu Jun 18 11:14:52 2015 UTC,Wow. $2.72 AND free shipping? I'm definitely going to be trying these. I want #6 cos it's the dupe for the RT blush brush which I really like! That's really disappointing you didn't have a good experience with the RT brushes. I got my first set a few years ago for Christmas and own almost all of them now and have never had any problems. But if the dupes work for you that's even better (for your wallet especially) :)  I swear the BBs nowadays don't get as big and puffy as they did when I first started using them! I will have to bust open a fresh BB along with the RT and compare them both for you guys.
AustralianMakeup,3a9kgy,chocolatespeckle,2,Thu Jun 18 15:57:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was really impressed with how fluffy and soft they turned out.  When I got my first one, I washed it straight up to see if it would shed much (I just used the Daiso brush cleaner) and there was maybe 1-2 stray hairs but I've noticed no shedding since and application has been great!  They've gone through about 2-3 washes now since and all are looking good so far!  The #6 brush is very fluffy, i've never used something so fluffy for blush so it's really awesome, I would definitely recommend!   If you get the time, it'd be great to see a comparison post of the RT and BB :D"
AustralianMakeup,3a9kgy,Flippantry,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:18:03 2015 UTC,Yes I love the RT blush brush because it's so fluffy! Really great with pigmented blushes because it doesn't pick up/deposit too much in one go.  Ok. Will do!
AustralianMakeup,3a9kgy,chocolatespeckle,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:01:48 2015 UTC,"I got a chichi makeup sponge and it gets so big and soft when I wet it, also it was really cheap!"
AustralianMakeup,3a9kgy,george1st,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:35:33 2015 UTC,"I bought a chi chi sponge the other day. I do prefer my RT sponge for BB creams and lighter foundations. However the Chi Chi is way better for heavy matte foundations like Revlon Color Stay (oily combo version), which destroy the RT sponge. I think it is because it is a stiffer sponge. However t is nowhere near as stiff as the manicare sponge. It's the perfect in between. So glad I picked one up."
AustralianMakeup,3a9kgy,WarlockPanda,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:53:05 2015 UTC,"Oh nice!  I was curious if the Chi Chi one would work similarly or if it was just a rebranded cheapie (like the Coles ones, eeek!), I might check it out next!  Thanks for the heads up."
AustralianMakeup,3a9kgy,Flippantry,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:15:51 2015 UTC,"I have tried BB, RT sponge, ChiChi sponge and Nation sponge and I have to say RT is the best. I actually find it easier to use it than the BB (maybe due to the shape of the RT sponge)."
AustralianMakeup,3a9kgy,Suriiiiiii,2,Sat Jun 20 07:51:41 2015 UTC,"Ooh please if you wouldn't mind, let me know how the fan brush is!! I've been tempted to pick one up for highlighting because right now I'm just using a cheap ELF blush brush but it sheds a bit on my face which is annoying"
AustralianMakeup,3a9kgy,starward-,1 point,Thu Jun 18 09:31:25 2015 UTC,"Will do. :D I also picked up the ELF fan brush. Idk why I thought I needed two, but I shall try and compare them for you as well. Ugh yeah I got the Sonia Kashuk 15th anniversary brush set in purple and half of them shed every time I use them. Totally get how annoying that is!"
AustralianMakeup,3a9kgy,chocolatespeckle,2,Thu Jun 18 09:48:35 2015 UTC,"I CANNOT for the life of me get the silicone liner brush to work. The eyeliner just sticks to it and only smudges onto my eye. I've tried Rimmel, Maybelline and L'Oreal gel liners and loose shadows with mixing fluid and it just doesn't work for me. How do you use it?"
AustralianMakeup,3a9kgy,criti_biti,2,Thu Jun 18 23:58:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'll admit, I had a bit of trouble using it this morning with my Maybelline Gel Liner but it is quite chilly this morning.  What I did before was warm up my gel pot a bit (just like, chuck it in your cleavage or between your legs or something haha, so it gets some of that body heat) I found that when it was a bit warmer, it was more co-operative and I was able to get a fairly crisp line.   I also tried it with a liquid liner in a little pot and it seems to work well with that too.  It might help to warm the silicone liner up in your hands if they're clean and warm, just to try and gently melt the liner a tad."
AustralianMakeup,3a9kgy,Flippantry,2,Fri Jun 19 03:20:33 2015 UTC,"I've been raving about this for the past few weeks since I tried it, but using the Nivea Post Shave Balm has completely changed my skin.  I have oily, but dehydrated skin, but I never really realised it was dehydrated.  I use the Simple Lightweight Hydrating Moisturiser which I thought was amazing because it made my skin soft & helped with my breakouts, but using the Nivea one? Holy gosh, my skin is COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.  It looks radiant, makeup lasts longer, it doesn't dry out as easily, I don't have gross dry patches, my dry/scabby pimples look better.  Just holy gosh, amazing product.  I love using it as a moisturiser (With the Simple one underneath, or else it isn't enough hydration) and as a primer.  Ugh, beautiful product!"
AustralianMakeup,3a9kgy,jamballdonut,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:36:51 2015 UTC,I only recently realised I am oily but dehydrated too! Moisturising sheet masks have been doing wonders for my skin on top of moisturiser if you ever need an extra boost :)

There's amazing makeup available at all price ranges. Essence, NYX and Chi Chi are great brands and have some real gems.

AustralianMakeup,3a8w5a,elfies_,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:00:17 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! The Josie Maran Argan Illuminizer looks absolutely stunning. I'm thinking that instead of purchasing the NARS Sheer Glow foundation for $75 (+ shipping) I might just purchase this instead for $45 (+ shipping) because apparently you can mix it in with foundation.  BUT. But I need to repurchase the ELDW foundation for $50 so if I purchase that and the illuminizer then I'm spending $95 anyway. So I'm better just buying the NARS foundation anyway.   Ughhhh.

AustralianMakeup,3a8w5a,elfies_,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:10:10 2015 UTC,"Have you tried sheer glow before? The finish of it and the finish you'd get by mixing josie with a foundation is very very different. You can use it on its own as a highlighter too, so it's functionally VERY different to foundation. Sheer glow does not have light reflecting particles which is what gives you the highlighter effect."
AustralianMakeup,3a8w5a,Tonkie,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:20:54 2015 UTC,"I know that it's very functionally different- I probably didn't phrase everything properly. I'm just wanting a 'dewy' sort of look altogether, and according to reviewers Sheer Glow is very light and dewy. I'm actually looking out for a new foundation, which is why I mentioned Sheer Glow. It would be a lot more cost-effective to purchase Sheer Glow on its own than re-purchase my current foundation and the Josie Illuminator as well.   Have you used Sheer Glow? If you have, what did you think of it?"

AustralianMakeup,3a8w5a,starward-,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:38:56 2015 UTC,"oh right ahaha makes more sense, i was thinking gurl whaaat? mainly because, sheer glow is not very dewy - that's why i was saying having the josie would give a totally different finish to the skin. yes i have used it before and completely contrary to its name, it's a light-medium (very medium) satin finish foundation. now the ""glow"" part comes from its satin finish which gives s nice healthy-looking ""luminosity"" it is far from dewy though i'd have to say - to be fair, when i think dewy i think of asian bb creams kind of dewy which is rarely found in any western foundation.    i haven't tried using josie with double wear myself, but i have used it with lancome teint idole ultra - which is a similar foundation though not as matte as the double wear. if you want to skip the luminizer and go straight for the ""dewy"" look i'd recommend you look into YSL le teint touche eclat, armani luminous silk (though tis $$$), by terry sheer cover. i prefer these foundations MUCH more, over the sheer glow"

Eyeshadows as highlighters is also super fun because you can use really out there colours if you're so inclined (sometimes I want to feel like a sparkly fairy princess ok?!).  Additionally I remember the Essence highlighters being lauded around the time of the last 40% off Priceline sale. IIRC, they are powder but are very soft to the touch and blend well."
AustralianMakeup,3a8w5a,chocolatespeckle,2,Thu Jun 18 04:57:11 2015 UTC,"Speaking of essence, they have a newish range of neutral eyeshadows out. i use the lightest brown as a highlight. It doesnt really transfer any pigment, but the sheen is amazing, and the powder is feather soft   edit: thats actually most likely what youre talking about. ďoh!"
AustralianMakeup,3a8w5a,freezethefire,2,Thu Jun 18 08:49:50 2015 UTC,"Haha all good. I just mentioned this in Tonkie's thread but using eyeshadows as highlighters is so fun. I get to experiment with ALL the colours, though I'm lucky in that I'm not currently employed in an office type job and I have the freedom to play around with how I look.   Essence is a constant pleasant surprise for me, while we're on the topic, because I never expect their products to be good based on the super reasonable price point and yet they generally are."
AustralianMakeup,3a8w5a,LMTartistry,1 point,Thu Jun 18 08:55:52 2015 UTC,The Essence highlighters are amazing. They are a cream to powder formula which seems to work well for most people. Definitely recommend considering they're only around the $6 mark.
AustralianMakeup,3a8w5a,LMTartistry,3,Thu Jun 18 08:41:36 2015 UTC,"Never tried it, but I've heard a lot of good things about the essence highlighter (which I think is called So Glow)."
AustralianMakeup,3a8w5a,Suriiiiiii,2,Thu Jun 18 05:04:35 2015 UTC,"I immediately thought of the $2 BOE highlighter /u/yves_sanjiv posted a couple of weeks ago here! Other than that I think the absolute cheapest highlighter I can think of would simply be to use an eyeshadow you already own. Sometimes if I'm in a rush I will just use Virgin from my UD Naked 1 palette as a highlight instead of going to grab something else.  If you don't mind loose powders and are interested in indies, try Hello Waffle. She has a couple of highlighters (I believe Lavender Cream is the most popular) and currently has a promo for free shipping if you spend over $35. If you're not looking to spend that much money, she also offers lettermail sample packs so you can just pick up like 5 samples with shipping for $10. :)  If you do decide to look for TheBalm's Mary Loumanizer, I would recommend you get it from ASOS. It's $34 there, but if you're a student you can get 10% off (or just wait for them to have a sale). They recently did 20% off beauty and that's when I picked mine up. :)"
AustralianMakeup,3a8w5a,muricaxoxo,2,Thu Jun 18 04:15:42 2015 UTC,Essence! Either their cream to powder ones which are permanent or keep a lookout for their trend editions which have some amazing ones - I have a cream from dark romance and a powder from some gardeny sort of themed one and love them both.

AustralianMakeup,3a8olc,trainology,10,Thu Jun 18 02:42:19 2015 UTC,"I've heard that Inglot shadows are a bit hit and miss? Although I've heard nothing but good things about MUG - and they're pretty affordable (ignoring the extortionate shipping costs). If you get the chance maybe see and swatch the inglot shadows you want in store.   Edit: Also, Inglot seems to have some more unique shades (if you're into that kind of thing) whereas a lot of MUG shades could probably be duped from brands like MAC etc."
AustralianMakeup,3a8olc,-eternal_sunshine-,5,Thu Jun 18 03:15:20 2015 UTC,"I have found Inglot to be hit & miss with their shadows as well, but the hits far outweigh the misses. I own lots of Inglot shadows and I would say out of 30 or 40 or so only maybe 5 were total fails - swatched great but then when I got them home the pigment doesn't transfer to the eye very well. The rest are 10/10 for quality!"
AustralianMakeup,3a8olc,Jessijames,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:22:20 2015 UTC,That was what i was thinking about as well. Costs for both would be practically even when it comes to shipping. Thank you so much for your comment!!
AustralianMakeup,3a8olc,WarlockPanda,10,Thu Jun 18 04:24:12 2015 UTC,"I have both brands. I 100% prefer Inglot over MUG for the following reasons:  1) the colours/swatches on the MUG website seem off I ended up with many very very similar colours in my MUG order as a result.   2) I prefer being able to swatch in person, which I can only do in person.  3) Every Inglot eyeshadow I have has been awesome. I have 6 mattes and 1 shimmer and I love them all. I bought 6 MUG shadows (shimmers/mattes) I find that the payoff of the MUG matte shadows are no where near as nice.  4) Inglot shadows are easier to blend. However the shimmers can be over blended. Transition shades are important for both brands. I struggle with blending for my MUG shadows."

AustralianMakeup,3a8olc,WarlockPanda,5,Thu Jun 18 04:26:42 2015 UTC,"I've not tried MUG, sorry.   But I have 10 INGLOT shadows in different finishes and colours and I couldn't fault them tbh. They last FOREVER (had mine since 2011 and the only ones I've hit pan on are ones I dropped and they broke) and they're seriously huge. I think someone said they're about double the size of a MAC shadow (which I think are the same as MUG)  Plus you can go in-store and try them all, unlike MUG.   Also brushes, blushes, gel liner, foundation and primer by them. 10/10 recommend. Love INGLOT!"
AustralianMakeup,3a8olc,lanadelghey,2,Thu Jun 18 03:08:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i've heard fantastic things about their gel liners! This lasting forever thing sounds fantastic, I tend to stick with the same colours when it comes to eyeshadows. Thank you for your comment!"
AustralianMakeup,3a8olc,WarlockPanda,3,Thu Jun 18 04:31:43 2015 UTC,I have three of their gel liners. I would definitely recommend them. They come in some lovely colours that you would not be able to find elsewhere.
AustralianMakeup,3a8olc,lanadelghey,2,Thu Jun 18 23:50:40 2015 UTC,Mine went dry after 2 years (probably should've thrown it then... But it's still almost full now!) so I just added baby oil (like two drops) and smushed it to mix it and it's better than new!
AustralianMakeup,3a8olc,berlin_chair_,4,Thu Jun 18 04:49:23 2015 UTC,I think it's better if you add eye drops to them from what I read online (better for your eyes). It does the same thing.

AustralianMakeup,3a81o2,Elizsabeth,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:02:32 2015 UTC,"I've tried using mascara on my brows but it didn't really work out since they are already dark and thick.

AustralianMakeup,3a81o2,starward-,1 point,Thu Jun 18 09:40:18 2015 UTC,"Just putting in my two cents.   I have really dark, thick brows and sometimes when I've used all the mascara on the brush for my eyelashes I run the spoolie through my brows. There's just enough product to make them darker and hold them neatly in place.   So I think if you remove some of the mascara from the wand it should be good to go."
AustralianMakeup,3a81o2,jamballdonut,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:59:59 2015 UTC,I have black hair and black eyebrows. I found using my mascara (I was playing with one I was about to throw out) gave a very heavy look. Like there's no way it could pass for natural. But if you are actually after the strong brow look I think this could work well!

AustralianMakeup,3a483i,lebarto,5,Wed Jun 17 02:38:47 2015 UTC,"Why hello!  So I remember the whole craze of Napa Vineyard in r/makeupaddiction but was upset that it wasn't available in Australia. Well today while I was browsing in Priceline, I came across Burt's Bees Lip Crayons!   I only bought Napa Vineyard as they were $16.99 each and I really shouldn't be spending money at the moment! I have included two swatches in the album, one on my hand and one on my lips. Both photos are taken in daylight although the quality isn't the greatest as I took the photos with my iPhone.  Review of Napa Vineyard  Colour: The colour is a deep red, with blue undertones. It does make my teeth look whiter which is always a plus. And I think it would definitely suit all skin tones!    Texture: On the lips, it feels very moisturising. I have not eaten or drank anything yet so I am not sure about the longevity.   Smell: If I smell the lip crayon from the tube, it does smell slightly like a crayon. But once on the lips, the smell is completely unnoticeable.  Is it worth the price? Hmmm. $17 is a fair bit of money for me to spend on a lipstick. It is priced $8.99 in America, so if it was the same price here then I would buy all of them without a doubt. With that said, I love the colour and texture so I think it is worth it."
AustralianMakeup,3a483i,elaboratekicks,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:39:35 2015 UTC,Thanks for the detailed reviews. That colour looks gorgeous on you. I'm going to have to pick one up.

AustralianMakeup,3a483i,starward-,3,Wed Jun 17 03:16:25 2015 UTC,"So far I've worn it for about two and a half hours.   In that timeframe I've had:   A glass of water: No transfer onto glass  Drink with white straw: Transfer onto straw  Cheese and crackers: On my lips it has faded slightly in the middle, but not the outside. So it kind of looks like I'm wearing a red lipstick with a darker red lip liner.    With that said, if I hadn't of eaten I think my lips would still be opaque. Hope this helps!"

AustralianMakeup,3a53mi,waveitdowninside,6,Wed Jun 17 08:15:51 2015 UTC,"Would suggest you to have a look at the Australis Velourlips. It is not the best matte liquid lipstick out there but it's super cheap and performs really well for the price. The whole Australis range is affordable actually.   The Models Prefer range also has good products. They had released 3 eyeshadow palettes last year which I liked a lot. I forgot the actual name but they do have naked 2 and 3 type packaging and similar brush as well. Their new soft touch powders are something worth checking out as well.   Edit: Models Prefer lipliners, I had one in orange which is one of my absolute favourites.    Another brand I can recommend is ChiChi. I have tried their eyeshadow pallets and lipsticks and enjoyed using them. Their BB cream though made me super oily after few hours so would suggest you to avoid that!   Also Lucas PawPaw ointment is the for a lip balm and helps in case of burns as well. It prevented me from getting a burn boil and scar once and since then has my highest respect.   Hope this helps. Have a good trip :)."

AustralianMakeup,3a53mi,Artemisian11,3,Wed Jun 17 08:43:05 2015 UTC,"I'd personally say so! Very dry and solid, only things to watch out for are how drying it is and that some can be a bit patchy if not applied carefully."
AustralianMakeup,3a53mi,Suriiiiiii,2,Wed Jun 17 10:18:55 2015 UTC,Yep! They are not like the matte lip creams that do not quite dry. That's why you might need to be a bit careful while applying the darker colours. Once it sets it'll get a bit messy while removing.
AustralianMakeup,3a53mi,Shiavo,6,Wed Jun 17 13:09:35 2015 UTC,"Aside from warning you about our prices over here (seriously, it's insane...your $1 ELF products are sold for $4-$10 on our shelves)...   Australis matte foundation is pretty good! I would recommend caution with a lot of their face products though! Their foundations and concealers are very comparable to stage makeup and can be OVERLY thick and pigmented. I suggest swatching wherever possible!! And if you go anywhere with a Big W, definitely check out BOE! It's a $2-$10 price range for nearly all of their products and some of their makeup is absolutely lovely! Really like their chubby lip pencils and highlighter. (Melbourne owned, cruelty free and most skin irritants free. But they're exclusive to only Big W stores).  Most important piece of advice. People aren't lying about the Lucas Paw Paw. Obtain this little tube of magic. Proceed with enjoyment (Can be obtained at most places like chemists, Target, Priceline)."

The lipstick is reasonably long-wearing too, and the brush hasn't shed on me at all despite being washed multiple times. The lip balm smells weird and has the texture of a drugstore balm, though."

AustralianMakeup,3a0wc9,meatmodel,29,Tue Jun 16 10:54:02 2015 UTC,"Are each of those products going to work with your skin type? What IS your skin type? If it's sensitive, do you really want to risk trying so many various different products on your face? Do you already have HG products in those categories (lip balm, makeup remover wipes, cleanser, moisturiser, etc.) that work for you? Do you really want to deviate from your HG products and try something that might not work for you?   How are you planning to reach the $69 required to get the goodie bag? With $69 worth of product you have to buy first, plus the goodie bag, does this fit in with any makeup goals you might have established for yourself? For example, I am trying to cut down on buying backups well before I need them, I've found skincare products that make my face happy and don't want to risk anything breaking me out, and I know that having that many skincare items I'm unsure about would just stress me out as I'm trying to cut down my stash. :) I know that while I would use the lip balms, the Swisspers pads, and the makeup remover wipes, I've already regretted switching lip balms recently (deviated from my fav Blistex in the blue tub) and don't want to make the same mistake again. Plus I have 3 packs of Swisspers already in my cupboard, as well as a few packets of makeup remover wipes which I try not to use too often anyway as they are a bit harsh for my skin (I usually remove makeup with olive oil).  Phew! Sorry that was so long, but I tried my best to talk you out of it! And I'll suggest /r/MakeupRehab if anyone needs more help :)"
AustralianMakeup,3a0wc9,chocolatespeckle,4,Tue Jun 16 11:10:09 2015 UTC,"Awesome points, you've definitely convinced me :) I never end up using half the things in these bags purely because they don't agree with my skin type, I certainly don't need another bunch of unusable products."
AustralianMakeup,3a0wc9,starward-,2,Tue Jun 16 12:10:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks starward :) GWP are always so tempting. I had to talk myself out of it as well! I saw the Neutrogena Deep Clean for normal to oily skin as well as the Le Tan bottle, and knew I shouldn't get it. I figure even if they cater to like dry/combo/oily skin, since I have dry skin that means half the bag might not work for me. And the only person I know who fake tans has moved to another country, so I wouldn't know what to do with the tanning stuff!"

I am currently in NZ and was kind of sad to be missing out this year because I always do a huge stock-up when the skincare goody bag rolls around.   But I guess I'll just splurge online! Woo! :-D
AustralianMakeup,3a1y5z,lunakitty_,4,Tue Jun 16 16:26:34 2015 UTC,"Yeeeeaaaaah, $25 shipping can go to hell 😒"
AustralianMakeup,3a1y5z,originalaliswan,3,Tue Jun 16 18:18:45 2015 UTC,I think it might actually be 35...usd...  :'(
AustralianMakeup,3a1y5z,ailee612,2,Tue Jun 16 21:55:21 2015 UTC,What's worse is that their shipping price is usually $25 and goes up to $35 for the sale!
AustralianMakeup,3a1y5z,blackgirldownunder,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:58:52 2015 UTC,That shipping is average but annoying. Im glad I bought The Balm from Oz Sale. They sold it 3 times before I gave in.

AustralianMakeup,3a1y5z,-eternal_sunshine-,2,Tue Jun 16 16:29:55 2015 UTC,maybe someone could organise a group buy to get over the 150USD free shipping limit? I would do it but I just don't have that much to spare right now #povolife
AustralianMakeup,3a1y5z,Jessijames,2,Wed Jun 17 00:05:27 2015 UTC,"It's hard with a sale like this, the window of time to organise is so small as is the length of the sale and $150 or so is a lot of money to spend when you can't guarantee everyone will have sent you the money beforehand. I'd put my hand up, but it's just not enough time really which sucks -.-"
AustralianMakeup,3a1y5z,-eternal_sunshine-,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:12:48 2015 UTC,yeah true - guess that's why they give such short notice for big sales like this :(

AustralianMakeup,3a0eny,redkoala,1 point,Tue Jun 16 07:49:56 2015 UTC,From what I've read/seen in reviews it's just a much more matte & oil-friendly counterpart which I am grateful for!
AustralianMakeup,3a0eny,Jessijames,1 point,Tue Jun 16 09:55:59 2015 UTC,"Hmm just a heads up, we'll be getting the uk colours which seem significantly different to the U.S. Ones...? Not sure if the actual foundation varies. But I see there's a primer too :D"
AustralianMakeup,3a0eny,gospursgo_,1 point,Tue Jun 16 08:35:20 2015 UTC,"This sounds about right, I know that at least with the True Match there is a huge difference in the formula, shade range and packaging between the US/NA version and the UK/EU versions so i presume this will be along the same lines! Let's hope they bring out the lightest shades here though, as there are even lighter shades in the True Match that the UK/Eu have & we don't -.-"
AustralianMakeup,3a0eny,Jessijames,1 point,Tue Jun 16 09:54:49 2015 UTC,"I've seen/read reviews that say the Infallible Pro Matte, (well from the US at least) doesn't run that light unfortunately."

AustralianMakeup,3a1aa0,neccessarygirl,2,Tue Jun 16 13:16:10 2015 UTC,You can also find the same set on Beauty Bay for AUD $145.50 with free shipping!
AustralianMakeup,3a1aa0,twoandtwenty,2,Tue Jun 16 15:16:46 2015 UTC,"This is where I bought my set from, however even though I saved $10 or so I ordered a couple of extra individual brushes from Luxola (literally the same day) & the Luxola took under 1 week to arrive and the Beauty Bay took almost 5 weeks haha If I knew Luxola was that great with shipping times I would have happily paid the extra! But Beauty Bay is still a good option. I've had one parcel go missing in transit and they resent it no hassle, I just had to fill out a form basically stating that I wasn't just trying to scam them out of extra products etc and that I was telling the truth about them going missing/having not received them (beauty bay 'free shipping' isn't tracked in any way)."
AustralianMakeup,3a1aa0,Jessijames,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:09:06 2015 UTC,amazing! thanks so much!
AustralianMakeup,3a1aa0,SEXPILUS,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:08:53 2015 UTC,"Both sites are reliable. Luxola is more expensive I think, and are often out of stock of a lot of Zoeva sets too. But they have discount codes (that may or may not be applied to these products).  Did you compare shipping costs?  Also, I'm pretty sure you can't shop in AUD on the Zoeva site, so consider conversion rates and any fees your bank might charge you for shopping in a different currency. I also think it works out cheaper if you shop on Zoeva in Euros compared to USD."
AustralianMakeup,3a1aa0,Jessijames,2,Tue Jun 16 13:26:26 2015 UTC,"Their discount codes strictly exclude Zoeva unfortunately! & yes, I believe Zoeva themselves charge something like $15 USD for shipping - there is no 'free shipping limit' that I've seen."
AustralianMakeup,3a1aa0,WarlockPanda,2,Tue Jun 16 13:35:41 2015 UTC,"I used a discount code to order my Zoeva brushes. It was not a huge discount though (something like 15%). They just don't discount them often, and definitely not large discounts."
AustralianMakeup,3a1aa0,Jessijames,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:32:18 2015 UTC,Yes I shopped in Euro and converted it to AUD. My bank doesn't charge a conversion fee :)   Discount codes can't be applied to Zoeva and a few other brands.

AustralianMakeup,39yc3n,kdarmy,12,Mon Jun 15 20:05:23 2015 UTC,I FINALLY HIT PAN on this Estée Lauder bronzer after almost three years.   What products have surprised you with their longevity?

AustralianMakeup,39yc3n,chocolatespeckle,2,Mon Jun 15 22:09:51 2015 UTC,Wow! Congrats :D I'm sure I have the exact same bronzer and it is a huuge compact. Mine is the Bronze Goddess in 03 Amber Bronze Medium. I really should destash it because I've probably only used it a handful of times since receiving it.  You should post this to /r/panporn as well :)

AustralianMakeup,39yc3n,Tonkie,2,Tue Jun 16 10:35:32 2015 UTC,"Yay! Makes me think about cosmetic expiry dates. I'm hard on switching mascara, but really how would a person ever use a product, particularly a powder like a blush or highlight or bronzer, in the recommended time?  That would be a whole lotta landfill wouldn't it?"
AustralianMakeup,39yc3n,Jessijames,2,Mon Jun 15 22:33:39 2015 UTC,"This is my dilemma. I absolutely always toss my mascara after three months, but powder face products... this is the oldest I have! I wash my brushes every week without fail, so is it okay to keep using a bronzer for so long? I don't think I'd keep eyeshadow for such a long time - I think perhaps I'd replace after a year?"
AustralianMakeup,39yc3n,Tonkie,3,Mon Jun 15 23:28:27 2015 UTC,"I really subscribe to (especially for powder), if it hasn't changed appearance, performance, texture or scent, it should be good :)"

Space NK is their equivalent to Mecca. Check out Charlotte Tillbury in Selfridges."

AustralianMakeup,39zjga,ComingUpMilhouse,1 point,Tue Jun 16 09:51:41 2015 UTC,"Seconding all the comments about Boots & Superdrug (the Collection concealer really is the bomb and it's 3 quid so stock up!). I still lust after the Sleek blush palettes and the 17 eyeshadow pot in Statuesque is my favourite eyeshadow ever. Also the Soap & Glory concealer which I've never seen here. I always found John Lewis to be the cheapest of the Myer-type stores if you're looking at high end or electronics like the Clarisonic etc. Also, car boot markets. There's usually a couple of slightly chavvy ladies selling Bourjois and Barry M for pennies that may or may not have fallen off the back of a truck."
AustralianMakeup,39wg9s,badassbettie,8,Mon Jun 15 10:37:13 2015 UTC,"Best: Lipsticks  I have a few, I LOVE ""Bring It On"" as the perfect mid lavender.  They are matte, but creamy, and glide on well and I dare say they rival MAC in quality!"
AustralianMakeup,39wg9s,Jessijames,2,Mon Jun 15 10:38:33 2015 UTC,"Agreed, however I only like the matte/satin finish. A lot of them are in a  different cream formula which imo sucks arse, applies patchy, doesn't last etc. But those matte satins.... Dang. Rival MAC for sure."
AustralianMakeup,39wg9s,Jessijames,2,Tue Jun 16 07:39:07 2015 UTC,"Huh!  Never realised there were different formulas. I must have all the same, as they are all quite matte ^_^"
AustralianMakeup,39wg9s,sarkata,1 point,Tue Jun 16 09:06:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's a little confusing as I don't think they're actually labelled as per the different formulas (at least on the packaging) & I know I bought one recently that was listed on their website as being a matte but it turned out to be their cream formula and it sucked haha"
AustralianMakeup,39wg9s,Shiavo,1 point,Tue Jun 16 09:52:47 2015 UTC,"I'm jumping on the bandwagon here! I own a lot of the lipsticks (the only one I've acquired since this was Spenderella because I have a purple problem), and their matte formula is a dream. I also really like the velvet formula, though it's only three shades. Not mad on the rosewater scent, I prefer the grape bubblegum scent of the velvets, but it's worth it. Some are truly better than others but generally, awesome."
AustralianMakeup,39wg9s,Jessijames,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:55:54 2015 UTC,Is there anyway to tell which one it is by the ingredients or any give aways on the package do you know? :)
AustralianMakeup,39wg9s,originalaliswan,2,Wed Jun 17 11:49:20 2015 UTC,"I've not paid that much attention to the ingredients list, but I know if you go on their website they list what finish the shades are from memory! But like I said, I bought one that was called a matter and it was definitely not a matte shade so just beware I suppose haha"
AustralianMakeup,39wg9s,ComingUpMilhouse,2,Wed Jun 17 12:20:09 2015 UTC,"Floral scents do not belong in lip products imo... Can't stand it. Especially rose! Ugh. For that reason alone I'll say they don't hold a candle to MAC.  Also I find the formula to be very hit or miss. Of the three I own, only one has a good formula (Husband Shopping - pinky purple, BEAUTIFUL, easily one of my faves even despite the scent). Fashion Police drags more than any matte ever - and ends up patchy as fuck if you close your mouth at all within five minutes of application? (I'd throw it out if the colour wasn't amazing). And Sex Bomb is grainy and uncomfortable (wtf seriously?) I will never buy a Chi Chi lipstick again without having a serious play with the tester... Not for that price. Like navigating a minefield, sheesh.  (Though that being said, I don't think all MAC lipsticks are great formula-wise. Brave and Impassioned were the most expensive formula disappointments ever!)"

AustralianMakeup,39wg9s,_yoshiii,6,Sun Jun 21 12:42:08 2015 UTC,"I'm a big fan of Chi Chi, so here's my list! (I can't spend any money at the moment, so please go forth and spend on my behalf so I can live vicariously through your hauls!)   Best:    Viva La Diva matte lipsticks. I have to avoid buying a new one every time I walk past the stand.  Viva La Diva velvet lipsticks. I only have one of these, but it has a gorgeous finish - I'm a bit obsessed with it.  Baked eyeshadows. Not cheap, but some beautiful shades and easy to work with.  BB and CC cream. There's are the only ones of these type of products I have found I like. Good light-medium coverage, comfortable to wear, not oily, and not orange.  Nail polishes. These work best with a base coat and a top coat (as does most polish though), but you can get them at such a great price if you buy the packs at sale or clearance time.    Worst:    Creamy Matte Liquid lipsticks. I have a few of these and I actually love them, but they are in no way a matte finish and they are not a no-budge formula like you would expect from a liquid to matte style product.  Eyeshadow Quads. Don't know if it is just me, but these don't seem as good quality as the rest of the brand's eyeshadow. The colours seem muddy and not very pigmented.    In between:    the Glamorous Eye Palettes. Everyone seems to adore these, but they are hit and miss in my experience. I've personally found the older ones to be lacking in pigmentation, but the newer ones that have come out in the last 12 months to be a lot better.  Fabulous & Flawless Foundations. I like the finish and coverage on this, but personally find the strong minty smell puts me off using it regularly. Also, it took me MONTHS to find my colour in stock at any of my local counters.  Brushes and sponges. Kind of middle of the road for me. Not the best, not the worst. I like the beauty blender type sponge, but it feels a little too dense and heavy for me."
AustralianMakeup,39wg9s,jamballdonut,2,Mon Jun 15 17:03:27 2015 UTC,"Oh my god the baked eyeshadows are fantastic. There's the expected half a dozen shades of brown, but there's also the most gorgeous shifting reds and purples and blues and greens. First Love is basically the prettiest thing I've ever owned."
AustralianMakeup,39wg9s,Flippantry,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:14:30 2015 UTC,The foundation has a ... minty smell?    ._. that sounds so fricken weird
AustralianMakeup,39wg9s,unreal-potato,3,Sun Jun 21 10:57:59 2015 UTC,"Things I love:   Their lipsticks - Great pigment, not too drying for the mattes, and just a great shade range! Their baked shadows - Holy gosh amazing blending and application, but the colours are a bit of a lie - I have an ""emerald"" green that's super bright green in the pan but applies as a mint green.   Things I hate:   Creamy matte liquid lipstick - These do nooooooooooot dry down matte whatsoever and I find them VERY slippery. Eyeshadow palettes - I have 9 of them, and honestly don't think they're as amazing as everyone claims - They're okay but definitely not the BEST DRUGSTORE SHADOWS EVER!!   Edit to add:  Things I'm not too sure about:   Their CC Cream in Fair - I LOOOOVED it the first time I bought it, but after using it a few more times I've grown to hate it.  It just goes really weird on my skin, and I don't even know how to explain it.  Wish I could've gotten a sample or something of it first, because it's just a hot mess. Their eyeliners - I have 2 of their wind-up eyeliners and they're okay, but they take quite a few swipes to get decent colour payoff and there's definitely better out there Demi cat lashes - These were the half strip ones, and from what I remember they were pretty good (I used them about 4 years ago), the only major thing were that they were quite hard and VERY plastic/thick feeling Sponge - I actually enjoy this, but I still don't have a proper opinion on it.  Much denser than my BeautyBlender, but does the job and my official BB comes off as more sheer, so this one does apply more product, which is nice."
AustralianMakeup,39wg9s,SchultzAL,3,Tue Jun 16 08:59:11 2015 UTC,"Best:   Eyeshadow Singles - I find many of these to be excellent quality and very generous in size, I've been working on one for over a year now and I've barely made a dip.   I still think their Palettes are really excellent too, there's a few that have more miss shades than hits but a lot of their neutral palettes have a good range of shades and decent payoff.  Considering Chi Chi is often subject to 30% off sales, you'd be hard pressed to find a better alternative in store in Australia.   Worst:   Their fragrances are just not for me... I've found most to smell very sickly sweet and a little cheap to be honest."
AustralianMakeup,39wg9s,sarkata,2,Tue Jun 16 12:15:16 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love their Bronze palette! I have two others, and plan to get the Mattes. I really like them, they're a great budget palette choice.  That's all I've really tried from Chi Chi though sorry I can't contribute more!"
AustralianMakeup,39wg9s,gospursgo_,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:52:02 2015 UTC,"I have the Bronzes, Bases, Mattes, and Taupes palettes and really like all of them. The other palettes have a lot of colours I would never use. Out of the ones I have, the Bronzes and Taupes are my favourites."
AustralianMakeup,39wg9s,SchultzAL,2,Mon Jun 22 06:54:42 2015 UTC,"I'll hop in even though most of my opinions have already been articulated by others.  Best   (Most of the) Matte and Velvet finish lupsticks - the mattes are generally pretty fantastic but I don't like the smell and some lighter shades can cling weirdly, while I love the smell and feel of the velvets, which wear shorter but don't have any dryness at all. I did a review of my collection here (Some of the) Eyeshadow Palettes - some of the palettes are awesome. I reach for the Mattes palette nearly everyday because it's got some great blendable lid and crease shades. The OMFG palette is brilliant in its brightness. I'm a bit more meh on the neutral palettes. Makeup sponges - they're cheap and they do their job. Great for foundations that tend to be cakey to sheer them out and make them look nice on the skin Eyeshadow crayons - I never see these talked about and I suspect they're being discontinued,  but these are glittery shadow crayons that stay in place all day. I love the gold one.   Okay   Basically every base product - I like but don't love the foundation, it has a lovely finish but I wish it stayed on longer. I really like the BB cream, but the super heavy perfume makes me not reach for it too often, as does the limited shade range. The blushes and bronzers are nice but not spectacular Creamy matte liquid lipsticks are fine as creamy liquid lipsticks, but are in no way matte Lip Stains are super pretty and wear for ages, but they have a really strong smell and I would like more pigment   Worst   chandelier glosses - they're possibly on this section because I generally don't like glosses, but these have so little pigment for the most part that most of the shades look similar. There's also way too much glitter for my taste"

I currently have 3, and 1 is coming in the mail. I am so impressed with how pigmented they are!  For worst, I just bought their 3 in 1 eye concealer in fair. It doesn't have very much coverage, but it could work if you layer it. I've only used it once though so I haven't really tried it out properly."
AustralianMakeup,39wg9s,originalaliswan,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:14:23 2015 UTC,"Have you tried ""cooking"" the concealer? It helps a little, I used to use an old revlon one and it made the coverage better.  Agreed with the eyeshadow! I bought two, and they are very nice."

There are no inserts,  but I'm cutting some cardboard to fit. It also has a dinky little key to lock it.   I also really love their Glossy Lip Stains.  I have viva la vixen, queen of red and a list pink (which was $6 at my Target!!).  I also find they're good to lessen transfer of my lipsticks.  I haven't used them yet, but their sponges are really dense,  more like the real techniques sponge than the beauty blender, so if you like the BB, you probably won't like the chi chi ones."

AustralianMakeup,39w1z1,SchultzAL,2,Mon Jun 15 07:26:34 2015 UTC,Do you have an ingredients list? It would be interesting to see how it compares to asian face masks of a similar price.

AustralianMakeup,39x11q,Kevtro123,3,Mon Jun 15 14:23:48 2015 UTC,"Honestly I would keep the 1 as it is the most versatile for day as well as night. I have 2 and am destashing it soon for this reason, don't own 3 but have heard many people who do make the same complaint."
AustralianMakeup,39x11q,pootlepower,3,Tue Jun 16 07:22:50 2015 UTC,"I'd keep Naked 1, if I had to throw all my other palettes out and could only keep one (which include Naked 3 and Electric, and Naked Basics 2), it would be Naked 1."
AustralianMakeup,39x11q,NirvanahCrane,2,Tue Jun 16 09:13:29 2015 UTC,"I use my 3 the most, and it's definitely my favourite, but I'm also pale & cool-toned.  I would honestly keep the first one, because it's definitely the most versatile and the one I reach for the most out of 1/2 (Since I'm not sure if 3 would suit you/is something you would use too often)"
AustralianMakeup,39x11q,jamballdonut,2,Tue Jun 16 09:01:55 2015 UTC,"I love Naked 1 the most but I guess it all depends on your skintone and the type of eye looks you like! I feel like the golds and warm shades in the Naked 1 would be the most flattering on warmer tones but I am no expert! I think the Naked 1 shadows are amazing and so easy to work with, and I never really appreciated how great they are until I tried lower end shadows."
AustralianMakeup,39x11q,neccessarygirl,2,Tue Jun 16 10:24:16 2015 UTC,Thanks for all of your opinions guys! I've decided to keep it (Because of the advice I have received) and am really excited about finally using it!
AustralianMakeup,39wd1d,Haibarai,2,Mon Jun 15 09:49:11 2015 UTC,"I've only bought samples from there, I don't know if they're fake or not but I don't think I'll buy from there again because (1) the staff are horribly rude and (2) it's not worth the fuss of worrying about authenticity to save a couple bucks. The people that work there seemed annoyed when I asked for prices but what do you expect when 99% of the items aren't even labelled with price tags?"
AustralianMakeup,39wd1d,continuousline,1 point,Mon Jun 15 11:03:48 2015 UTC,"I feel like they may be similar to a store I went to in Sydney around this time last year (They were busted and closed down a week after I left).  They sold a LOT of luxury items (YSL, Estee Lauder, Chanel, Tom Ford - All behind glass), as well as MAC & Nars, then just normal drugstore brands (But I'm assuming American imports, since there were quite a few products/shades we don't have here), etc.  The main thing was that I didn't recognise a lot of products & names weren't the ones they should've been.    My guess is that they're probably dodgy, but I'll be quite happy if someone proves me wrong!"
AustralianMakeup,39wd1d,jamballdonut,1 point,Mon Jun 15 10:01:08 2015 UTC,"I searched ""vivi"" and saw it discussed a year ago not a great deal of conversation there though so it's definitely worth asking."
AustralianMakeup,39wd1d,ComingUpMilhouse,1 point,Mon Jun 15 10:27:23 2015 UTC,Thanks for the link! I think I'll pass buying from that store just because I'll always wonder if I bought a fake.....plus the lady there seemed pretty annoyed when I asked if there were testers... :S
AustralianMakeup,39wd1d,ShadowWriter,1 point,Mon Jun 15 10:52:54 2015 UTC,I thought UD was exclusive to Mecca? In which case they're knock offs.
AustralianMakeup,39woo5,emmaisabellaa,4,Mon Jun 15 12:26:53 2015 UTC,just a thought but does your foundation have  SPF in it? the flashback from the SPF is what could be causing ghostliness in your photos!  also: bronzer is your best friend!
AustralianMakeup,39woo5,thingsloversdo,2,Mon Jun 15 12:56:43 2015 UTC,Ugh I just checked and it does!   Could you recommend another foundation? Middle of the range would be preferred :)
AustralianMakeup,39woo5,Jessijames,3,Mon Jun 15 22:54:09 2015 UTC,"Perhaps a little more information could be useful, what types of foundation do you like? Low, medium, high coverage? What are you using currently? Matte, satin or dewy finish? It's a little hard to give you a recommendation without info like this we'd be swinging blind!   Also, why not just pop into Priceline or a department store if you have one and look around for foundations specifically without SPF & look at the testers or grab some samples?   Also, just from personal experience bronzer is not necessarily going to fix it. When I was younger I had the same flashback issues in as you call it, 'clubbing' photos and would pack on the bronzer to counteract it thinking it was just because I'm so pale and not realising it was because of SPF/flashback reasons and it didn't help one bit. It just made my neck and chest look incredibly orange and out of place and my face still pasty."
AustralianMakeup,39uo71,Eeveelicious,8,Sun Jun 14 22:56:30 2015 UTC,"I have the Estee Lauder Double Wear, I got it for my cousins wedding, which was in Summer. That stuff is like paint. It will not budge once it's on. Whilst everyone was drenched in sweat, my makeup was perfect all day. My skin is also VERY oily, and it keeps that at bay. I'm not sure what this would be like on dry skin.  I've heard people saying it's light-medium coverage but I find it to cover pretty much everything in one layer with a damp sponge. However it is buildable in case that's what you need.   I've tried it with brushes however I find it works best with a damp sponge (beautyblender).   I'd say just go get a sample from a counter to try, first."
AustralianMakeup,39uo71,Stelare,2,Mon Jun 15 00:05:28 2015 UTC,"Having tried the DW on combination skin with some flaky spots, I can say that it really accentuated my flaky spots. Best applied with the damp beauty blender, definitely. :)"
AustralianMakeup,39uo71,SchultzAL,2,Mon Jun 15 00:56:00 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see. I have heard people with oily skin saying it works great for them. I did actually try it with loose powder underneath (Wayne Goss thing) and that made my face look cakey and dry.  Also on the note of primers, I just used the UD setting spray over the top. Didn't want to look too matte. Which when you have oily skin, is often hard to avoid when you need tons of powder.  I think just some good moisturiser first and the damp sponge would ultimately work best."
AustralianMakeup,39uo71,Stelare,2,Mon Jun 15 06:21:35 2015 UTC,"Do you find the colour range okay? I've always wanted to try double wear, but not sure how pale they go, and if it's worth the money (I should probably just hurry up and go and get a sample of it!)  Also wondering what primer you use with it + powder + anything else? I always hear people recommend foundations that are perfect for oily skin, but they never work for me!"
AustralianMakeup,39uo71,jamballdonut,1 point,Mon Jun 15 09:55:33 2015 UTC,"From what I hear in other beauty groups, apparently they don't go pale enough; or at least, in Australia they don't. Best to get colour matched  at the desks. (:"
AustralianMakeup,39uo71,jamballdonut,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:20:55 2015 UTC,"Ugh, that doesn't surprise me! Hoping they do have a shade here light enough for me though!"
AustralianMakeup,39uo71,Stelare,1 point,Tue Jun 16 08:55:42 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I don't know what the colour range is like. The Estee Lauder Australia website shows 16 colours.  However I bought mine from Sephora in Singapore, in a shade that we don't seem to have here in Australia (Dawn).  When I used it for the wedding, I don't think I used a primer. I don't use primer at all, because the only primers I have are silicone based and they seem to break me out.  I just use a good moisturiser underneath. Then apply with damp sponge, let it set for a bit, and then I use the UD oil control setting spray. If I feel like I'm going to be really oily that day, I'll either powder, or powder+spray. I've been using the MUFE HD powder at the moment, however I also really like the Australis Ready Set Go finishing powder.  And I hear ya. My skin is REALLY oily around my t-zone. And it doesn't seem to matter what the season is or anything, I'm just always oily. The only other thing that works decently on my skin is the Garnier BB cream (oily skin formula). However that colour range is extremely limited :(  If I can recommend anything else, it'd be the Tarte Amazonian Clay powder foundation. But I don't know if that'd be suitable for your needs."
AustralianMakeup,39uo71,jamballdonut,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:16:13 2015 UTC,"Thank you for replying! Gives me some stuff to think about, and just allows me to be a little lazier and put off getting a sample haha"
AustralianMakeup,39uo71,Nikaa,8,Tue Jun 16 08:55:19 2015 UTC,"Ask for samples, try both. A well matched foundation can often eliminate the need for concealer altogether.   There are a lot of factors which vary depending on person to person, such as, but not limited to:     Shade selection - how close a colour match is it? Are the undertones meshing with your skin? Does it oxidise? Skin specific issues - Does it move around/settle into fine lines? Does it exacerbate any skin issues? In theory many of these things can be rectified by using primers/powders/mattifiers/facial oils etc but a foundation should be able to perform without any of the above to be ideal. What are your coverage needs? Both Mac Prolongwear and Estee Lauder Double Wear have a number of products in their ranges. If you intend to conceal anyway would a lighter coverage foundation be appropriate (such as the new Mac Prolongwear Waterproof or Estee Lauder Double Wear Light)? Alternatively, products like Estee Lauder Double Wear Maximum Cover rarely calls for additional concealer at all. How much does it cost? If you are looking to pay a little extra money for foundation (which it seems like you are) you absolutely want to get your money's worth. If you're paying $50-60 on foundation but have to use a number of other products (as discussed above) to make it work, how much are you really paying?   That's all I got off the top of my head for now, but bottom line is, grab samples, try them all. Try without a primer and see how it lasts all day; try it with the primers you normally use to see how well they sit together. Try it in pretty much all the situations you'd be in normally to see if it gives you everything you need from a foundation."
AustralianMakeup,39uo71,Tonkie,2,Mon Jun 15 02:12:45 2015 UTC,"That's a really good reply, yay you :)"
AustralianMakeup,39uo71,ComingUpMilhouse,1 point,Mon Jun 15 08:22:47 2015 UTC,And this is why foundations are so bloody hard to buy.

AustralianMakeup,39uo71,pootlepower,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:18:18 2015 UTC,Sales people pretty much have to give samples if you ask (they generally have tiny bottles ready to be filled for this purpose) -- they'd just rather you just make an impulse buy since it helps meet their sales targets.
AustralianMakeup,39uo71,ladyhellcat,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:47:20 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for how they compare but I own the liquid double wear concealer. Would advise against it if you are looking to conceal under eyes as it is prone to creasing, it sets pretty fast so you can't really blend the creases out. If you are looking to conceal blemishes it's great, though."

Also, Blistex do a nice tinted high spf lip balm. Or Burt's Bees (not sure of their spf rating).  Urban Decay's smaller setting sprays from Mecca (the $22 ones) are light and fairly portable. Also, are there any 'gift packs' by your favourite brands with mini products around?"

I use the colour 'Light Matte' (no idea why it's called 'sun shimmer' when it's matte). I find it's great for a light contour or just to bring a bit of colour to my face, especially when I am only wearing something light like a BB cream."
AustralianMakeup,39t7ba,Teacupbunny,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:30:25 2015 UTC,"Best multi-tasking travel makeup I have ever bought is Two Faced's No Makeup palette. It has concealer, brightener, luminiser, plus a subtle blusher and bronzer (well it's called a bronzer but is more like a nice natural glowy kind of powder). It is small and in a metal palette/case which I find keeps the powders from breaking up.  Obviously this doesn't cover everything but this is my fave multitasker.  The other thing I would recommend is the Benefit mini's you get at Myer and the like. Usually they are available in a set of three or four items. The Bad Gal mascara is my favourite long lasting mascara - the mini size lasted me a couple months while travelling in the UK."

I stopped by just to get some concealer refills and the duraline but went home with all these other goodies! I'm not sure if the promotion is still on, but when I shopped there, they gave away 20% off vouchers for people who bought over $100 to use next time. Guess I'll be shopping there again....soon."

From what I can see its about $700 to get done, which for my current state of brows is a bit much but golly, if I did get them done i'd go to her.  She has instagram as well, I think that gets updated more.  No affiliation. Just strong opinions on eyebrows ☺  /u/ComingUpMilhouse"

Paid $595 and very happy with them (well I am self-conscious about how dark they are now but they fade about 30-40% as they heal). I'm sure there would be a lot of places in Sydney to get them done, I don't think travel elsewhere would be necessary. Any questions you have about the process, please feel free to ask."

AustralianMakeup,39pfhu,ComingUpMilhouse,2,Sun Jun 14 14:07:02 2015 UTC,I too would like to know more about this. My friend would love to get this done and she's explained to me that cosmetic tattooing is a completely different skill to normal tattoo artistry.
AustralianMakeup,39pfhu,ShadowWriter,3,Sat Jun 13 13:52:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, like, it only lasts 2-3 years? They must put the ink into a shallower layer of the epidermis."
AustralianMakeup,39pfhu,blackplague06,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:24:29 2015 UTC,Yeah - from memory it's not as deep into the skin as standard tattooing.
AustralianMakeup,39pfhu,lush1984,1 point,Sun Jun 14 09:58:42 2015 UTC,Yeah it sounds prison like. The scalpel strokes into your skin and rub ink into it. Then 2 weeks later you go for touch ups. 😶
AustralianMakeup,39pfhu,blackplague06,1 point,Sun Jun 14 10:01:53 2015 UTC,"I've gotten a few tattoos in some painful areas (chest and elbows) but I gotta agree - I'm scared of scalpels as is. I want my eyebrows done, but damn.   Gets to the point where I am tempted to float the idea to my tattoo artist to see if he'd do my eyebrows with the smallest needle they have.   Luckily I haven't gotten sick of doing my eyebrows just yet, since I can get away with using black, because my hair is dyed black."
AustralianMakeup,39pfhu,pyjamasquid,2,Sun Jun 14 10:09:33 2015 UTC,"Chiming in to say - I've got some tattoos (back, knuckles, thigh and entire left arm including the elbow completely blocked in) and I've had my eyebrows done! Most cosmetic tattoo places use numbing cream, and you really don't feel anything once they've set in. Absolutely not comparable to a ""real"" tattoo in any way. Also, the lady who did mine didn't use a scalpel; it wasn't a tattoo gun either, but some kind of pen? I didn't get a good look at it unfortunately, but it was closer to a gun rather than a scalpel - it made the incision and deposited the ink in one go.   You do have to do a touch-up, but it's really not a big deal! Mine was a month after my appointment (I was told it would probably not be completely healed after any shorter than that). It's good to have that second appointment, because the artist can then see how everything looks and correct any patches that may not have taken correctly. In mine, she added some other strokes that were going in slightly different directions, just to make it look more like real hair.  tl;dr this is an essay but it was absolutely worth it, for me! I think it's not common to do the scalpel thing any more so I'm sure you can find a place that doesn't do that :)"
AustralianMakeup,39pfhu,blackplague06,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:42:00 2015 UTC,"Interesting!   I always bug my artist/friend about his machine, I must know how it functions, what number needle he's using and what he's gonna do. Hopefully it doesn't shit him off too much, he's got $1000 worth of work out of my currently, still gonna finish off a sleeve, my massive chest and sternum piece and my other arm.   I want bold, dark browns. But like I said, I change my style up every few months, so it's a commitment."
AustralianMakeup,39pfhu,lush1984,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:08:21 2015 UTC,Girl. I feel your pain. I'm 100% with you. The girl that does it in our city charges $800 for it. I can not justify that $$ for something that'll last 2 years before fading to smudge.
AustralianMakeup,39pfhu,blackplague06,1 point,Sun Jun 14 10:21:10 2015 UTC,"Really tempted to ask my artist if he'd be down to do something like that - like the feathering, but with a small needle.   I've always wanted freckles as well.   :c"
AustralianMakeup,39pfhu,lush1984,1 point,Sun Jun 14 10:24:53 2015 UTC,"I think for me, it's how the tattoo will fade. The skin on your face is more delicate and translucent than your body. It's also exposed to the sun a lot more. After 10 yrs, you could end up with a blobby mess."
AustralianMakeup,39pfhu,blackplague06,1 point,Sun Jun 14 10:34:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's my issue - I hate faded tattoos, one of my artist had a 5 year old dagger tattooed on his face, and it's quite faded, but considering how exposed it is, it's held up quite well.   I will definitely ask my artist next time I see him if he'd be able to give me an idea of the logistics.   It's not something I am gonna rush into, because I've changed my eyebrow shape considerably this past few months, and I'm not entirely set on it just yet."
AustralianMakeup,39pfhu,starwish216,2,Sun Jun 14 10:39:53 2015 UTC,"I haven't had eyebrow tattooing done myself, but this beauty blogger is in Sydney and she had it done recently, her review: http://www.wengie.com/2015/01/korean-3d-eyebrow-tattoo-everything-you.html    Hope that helps a bit!"

I got it in Marie Claire's The Parcel and was skeptical, because I seldom try out new mascaras, but I've not used another one since! For me it gives the perfect balance of length and thickness, and leaves my lashes kinda fluffy as opposed to sticky or stiff (which is how I like them). Of course everyone is different though!"
AustralianMakeup,39p84x,redkoala,1 point,Sat Jun 13 13:15:53 2015 UTC,I got mine in The Parcel as well. It's very volumising and black! I'd buy it again..

The formula was a bit too gloopy and thick to work with, and very, very wet. The brush is just annoying. The end result was great, I have to admit, but the application is too much of a hassle for me."
AustralianMakeup,39p84x,MidnightNation,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:02:48 2015 UTC,"I, like many others, got in The Parcel. I find it works amazingly well when I layer it with Clump Crusher first as it can be a little clumpy by itself. If I do about 3 layers it looks like I have falsies on.  Would definitely recommend."
AustralianMakeup,39p84x,courpsey,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:47:22 2015 UTC,"It can be a little bit fiddly, and I've found that if I do my typical wiggling the wand to try and prevent clumps, it clumps like crazy. But other than that I really like it. I use it when I feel like having more dramatic lashes for the day :) I probably wouldn't buy it full price though."
AustralianMakeup,39k8sn,lyzaw,16,Fri Jun 12 08:49:25 2015 UTC,"I've worked in Target and the reason is because they're understaffed and often won't put anyone in the cosmetics area. When restocking, the cosmetics area is like the least important one and often overlooked. A lot of the items sit in the overstock."
AustralianMakeup,39k8sn,laughingdugong,11,Fri Jun 12 09:23:18 2015 UTC,Strange they'd choose to do this but then have a 30% off cosmetics sale every other week?
AustralianMakeup,39k8sn,reddit-g,6,Fri Jun 12 10:18:34 2015 UTC,They put the sales on hoping we buy other shit. Don't know about you but I walk straight into the cosmetics section and out again. I know cosmetics get stolen a lot and half the time the store layout has a 'counter' there but there is never a staff member. Bigw is the same. My local had printed signs all over cosmetics saying cosmetics had to be purchased at the cosmetics counter/register. Said register had 3 baskets of loose stock (not from cosmetics) and a whole bunch of other rubbish - no staff. Went through self service :)

AustralianMakeup,39k8sn,AurelieBastienne,2,Fri Jun 12 09:12:43 2015 UTC,I feel like the Morley one would have the same issues with degenerate bogans tbh. CBD one in Perth was more stocked than I've seen in a while when I was there Thursday..

AustralianMakeup,39k8sn,_yoshiii,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:21:14 2015 UTC,I actually made the trek out there last Saturday to check out Mecca Maxima - the Target there looked a bit sad :( I think it's because of all the sales that the stand is emptying and simply not being restocked.

One of the stores nearby my house is generally quite well stocked and clean but don't even dare to go to the one in Adelaide CBD, it's always been utter chaos.  Parts of the display are broken, testers smeared everywhere, garbage within the makeup (not just for the NYX stand either, they're all pretty awful).  I don't think they hire enough staff for the health and beauty sections for most stores."

Shipping can take a few weeks, but as long as you're not in a rush I've never had any problems with them.  ASOS - Free shipping over $40. Great place to get Bourjois items! If you hang out for a 20% off sale/code it's fantastic and soo much cheaper than Priceline. I also bought TheBalm from ASOS recently since I can't find it at DJs anymore.   iherb - They've got an affordable shipping option with auspost now so it's only around $5 :) Can get Real Techniques, ELF, Bdellium Tools.  Luxola - Free shipping over $55. I haven't purchased from here before, but I know others have.  Amazon can also be a good option with reasonable shipping. I've never paid more than US$10 to ship to me and I've purchased a Stila palette and multiple Lorac palettes from them. Just make sure you are buying items that are specifically shipped from and sold by Amazon as that is coming from them directly and is legit. :)  Beautylish - Free shipping over US$100."

Also shipping is $4.95 or free when you spend $100  Crush cosmetics - They sell brands like milani and NYX (although we can buy it at target) Shipping is dependant on where you live but it's not much at all. Around $10 if you're in Sydney  Beautybay - Free shipping for all orders over $20 AUD  That's all I can think of atm!

AustralianMakeup,399ps3,neccessarygirl,4,Wed Jun 10 07:10:15 2015 UTC,"I've been using Paul Mitchell Tea Tree shampoo & conditioner for awhile (and off and on for 15 years), in rotation with Lush Daddy-O + American Cream conditioner. The TTO shampoo can be a bit too drying in the winter, and it will strip colour (especially reds and chocolate browns). The Daddy-O shampoo does a fair enough job of keeping my blonde hair from not getting brassy or yellow. When it runs out, I will probably try Joico.  I order Aussie 3 Minute Miracle from Amazon (so cheap and really hydrates my hair) and use it about once a week.  I got Argania Light Hair Oil from Priceline about a month ago and like it a lot better than the Moroccan Oil I used before. It isn't full of silicones and actually hydrates my hair, as opposed to just sealing the cuticle and making it look glossy. For some simple smoothing of flyaways and that glossy look, I use Redken Glass drops and have been using that for more than 15 years, as well.  I love Wella Colour Charm T18 toner to combat brassiness.   As for using oils to hydrate the hair, I found that coconut oil actually made mine feel more dry, somehow. I have had better luck with avocado oil and macadamia oil.   I rarely heat style, but I use a Tresemme heat protector when I do. It's the one in the black bottle with a red pump/handle."

It's not bad, but I'll 100 percent be going back to the Kerastase when it's finished. That stuff is liquid heaven in a bottle, worth every cent if you have dry/damaged ends like mine.   Other than that, I don't use much else product wise. I usually use the GHD heat protection spray but again recently grabbed the Tony & Guy version on sale and so far it does the job just as well! But these days I only use heat on my hair maybe 2-3 times a month if that but I'm fairly lucky and my hair naturally dries quite straight and wearable so I leave it is is most of the time."

AustralianMakeup,399ps3,starwish216,2,Thu Jun 11 08:24:20 2015 UTC,"I use Wen Cleansing Conditioner. It's pretty hard to get it in Aus so I have to buy it online (~$45ish) and it's done wonders for my oily scalp. I've always had to wash my hair everyday, I know they say that's really bad for you and makes your hair oilier, but my hair gets so greasy after 24hrs, I have to wash it, not even dry shampoo can help because it gets so flat. I also have dark hair so the greasiness is really obvious. Wen Cleansing Conditioner cleanses and conditions in one go, so it's a lot more gentle and as a result, my hair is getting a lot less oily. I'm able to stretch it out to washing it every second day and just use my favourite dry shampoo, bumble and bumble pret a powder, in between!   For pre-shampoo, I use Moroccanoil Oily Scalp Treatment and then wash it off in the shower. For hair serum/treatment, I go in with Moroccanoil Treatment Light, I like it a lot better than the original one, it doesn't weight my hair down as much and leaves my hair so beautiful and silky."

She use to use the original ones before 613 was released, I think her favourite was the limited edition Summer Mango Coconut, which is pretty impossible to find (same does for the limited edition Winter Vanilla Mint). I'm currently using the Cucumber Aloe one and really enjoying it, but I also have Fig, Pomegranate and Sweet Almond lined up to try. I have also tried the Lavender one, wasn't a huge fan of scent (I'm just not really a lavender person). I haven't tried 613 yet, but I've heard it's super nourishing, I'm a little worried it might be TOO nourishing for how oily I am :/"

My go-to shampoo and conditioner has been TIGI Resurrection, and I've just introduced O&M Seven Minute Miracle with really good results. I'm surprised how nice it makes my hair considering it markets itself as an organic, ""all-natural"" product. Plus it smells like creme brulee! I'm using my sister's leftovers for toning shampoo - Marc Daniels Blue Cypress Blonde. It smells amazing! Then there's some Joico hanging around in the cupboard for when that runs out. How do you find the Fudge Purple Shampoo works?   But the biggest changes to my hair have come from two products. The first is Olaplex - goddamn that shit is expensive but it works. It genuinely repaired my hair, and not in a ""temporary mask"" kind of way. It's still good after weeks (months?) and another root bleach. The other product is....... Supermarket conditioner! That Nature's Organics stuff that's like $4 at Woolies? I used it for a lark but it makes my hair softer and smoother than TIGI or O&M!! I still can't believe it.   For styling I find O&M Frizzy Logic smooths things out, and I style with a bit of Fudge Shaper.   Good idea for a thread! I'm excited to read everyone else's replies."

I also don't use heat - no hairdryer unless it's winter and I've rinsed my hair at night and I never straighten it (curly hair rocks!) .

You can gently pat it on for a light application or really build it up for a full on vampy lip.  Edit: I would definitely call it a deep plum colour"
AustralianMakeup,399kt3,WarlockPanda,2,Wed Jun 10 08:20:02 2015 UTC,I was going to recommend grunge. I went through so many crappy dark lipsticks before finding it and just thought to myself why didn't I buy this sooner?! I love the formula of those lipsticks too.
AustralianMakeup,399kt3,freezethefire,1 point,Wed Jun 10 09:50:19 2015 UTC,This was mentioned in another comment tonight! I think that's a sign that I definitely need to try it out!
AustralianMakeup,399kt3,walkyouhome,5,Wed Jun 10 10:30:43 2015 UTC,"NARS Train Bleu Velvet Matte Pencil! Super dark, super pretty, and because it's a matte formula it doesn't smudge or feather, which is a big plus for me."

AustralianMakeup,399kt3,walkyouhome,2,Wed Jun 10 11:40:57 2015 UTC,"Haha me too, I was chatting to the girls at Mecca about how devastating it was to not be able to get it anymore, and they were like 'What are you talking about it's right over there...'"
AustralianMakeup,399kt3,ComingUpMilhouse,2,Wed Jun 10 20:11:52 2015 UTC,I'm glad I wasn't the only one then. I want it now.
AustralianMakeup,399kt3,gospursgo_,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:24:28 2015 UTC,Love it! Definitely need something that doesn't smudge if it's going to be a bright/dark colour!
AustralianMakeup,399kt3,starward-,3,Wed Jun 10 10:27:16 2015 UTC,The dark shade in the maybelline lip velvet pencil things (wow much detail) is AMAZING. And obviously the dark velourlips- ddoobai and budapash are great cause they don't smear everywhere.
AustralianMakeup,399kt3,lyzaw,1 point,Wed Jun 10 07:02:38 2015 UTC,"The dark shade in the Maybelline lip pencil was actually what inspired me to get into dark colours! :D (hehe I knew what you meant)  After reading so much about velourlips, why haven't I tried them yet?! Definitely will next time I'm in Priceline! (which will probably be very soon haha)"
AustralianMakeup,399kt3,szarkasm,1 point,Wed Jun 10 10:32:27 2015 UTC,"Just be aware that the Velourlips can be drying, way more so than the Maybelline pencil formula (though I've only tried a lighter shade so YMMV!). That said, Doo-Bai is one of my favourite darker lip colours!"
AustralianMakeup,399kt3,szarkasm,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:41:43 2015 UTC,"They're incredibly drying. They have great pigmentation and don't budge at all, but honestly they are so uncomfortable that I hardly ever choose to wear them. If you're only going to be wearing them for a couple of hours and then taking them off, they're a great option. Any longer than that and my lips feel like they're going to peel off :(  Edit: They also flake and peel off. They don't really move, but if you eat or drink then the colour peels off on the middle of your lips which then makes it hard to reapply. Honestly, I don't recommend them."
AustralianMakeup,399kt3,winter_iris,1 point,Sat Jun 13 10:31:09 2015 UTC,"I agree, I wouldn't recommend them either. They dry, crack, peel and go patchy in the most unappealing way. I also find they apply uneven and for some reason, the centre of my lip is always lighter than the rest. An annoying product that is not worth its staying power."
AustralianMakeup,399kt3,ailee612,1 point,Sun Jun 14 11:13:35 2015 UTC,"Hmmm thanks for the info! I might just wait and if they're ever on sale for super cheap, I'll buy one to try. I find the NYX Soft Matte Lip Cream too drying so I imagine this is the same thing"
AustralianMakeup,399kt3,chocolatespeckle,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:23:32 2015 UTC,"The NYX Soft Matte Lip Creams are definitely one of the more non-drying comfortable to wear liquid lipsticks out there. It definitely varies formula to formula, but in general, if you find SMLCs too drying I wouldn't recommend you try these at all."
AustralianMakeup,399kt3,starward-,3,Tue Jun 16 09:44:03 2015 UTC,Sports Girl Bitten (dark berry) and Dark Angel (dark red) are pretty good. Revlon Colorburst Matte Balm in Sultry is a nice deep dusky pink. If you are open to metallics then I'd also like to mention NYX Wicked in Power as it can look pink or maroon or various shades in between depending on the light.  On the more expensive end but Mac Rebel is a lovely dark berry (might be a little too pink to be called plum though).
AustralianMakeup,399kt3,ComingUpMilhouse,1 point,Wed Jun 10 08:32:43 2015 UTC,I'm heading to Target soon to get some 30% off NYX so I'll have a look at the Wicked lippie while I'm there! Wowww Mac Rebel looks amazing!
AustralianMakeup,399kt3,ComingUpMilhouse,1 point,Wed Jun 10 10:29:35 2015 UTC,"Mac Rebel is such a nice versatile product! Sheered out it's a very pretty pink, but when applied opaque it's a gorgeous, quite a bit darker, purple-pink lip. Would totally recommend!"

AustralianMakeup,399kt3,thexcheshirexcat,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:36:11 2015 UTC,"Thirding Dark Angel... I agree that despite being on the cheaper end of the price scale the formula delivers, and they always have testers out in the store which is a big plus for me!"
AustralianMakeup,399kt3,starwish216,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:40:32 2015 UTC,I love MAC Rebel but I'd call it a bright lipstick rather than dark. Maybe it's because I have a habit of wearing really dark looks.   This is a link to a vlog of mine that's not about makeup but I'm wearing MAC rebel in sunlight.  As opposed to the lip in this vlog in which I'm wearing a NYX crayon.

AustralianMakeup,399kt3,ComingUpMilhouse,1 point,Fri Jun 12 09:18:40 2015 UTC,"Seconding 'Dark Angel' from sportsgirl, it's still on their website but not at any of the (At least) Brisbane stores I've been to in the past week. A bit feathery but a liner fixes that easily."
AustralianMakeup,399kt3,assaulted_peanuts,3,Sat Jun 13 13:56:59 2015 UTC,"The Australis Velourlips in 'Doo-Bai' is really nice (and cheap). I guess I'd call it a dark berry shade. Revlon's Black Cherry is a nice shade too but works better as a stain unless you like the patchy lip look. It has a slightly more blue undertone than the velourlips so is more of a 'plum', but there's not much of a difference really."
AustralianMakeup,399kt3,sydneysomething,2,Wed Jun 10 09:42:12 2015 UTC,"That Australis Velourlips looks like exactly what I need!  Oo I've heard about the Revlon Black Cherry in the past, clearly I need to get some ;)"
AustralianMakeup,399kt3,assaulted_peanuts,1 point,Wed Jun 10 10:23:46 2015 UTC,"I second Revlon's Black Cherry, it's a beautiful shade. Milani's Black Cherry is gorgeous too. The two colours are almost dupes of each other but I feel like the Milani builds colour better. As /u/thexcheshirexcat said, if you try to build Revlon Black Cherry, it can get patchy. Milani Black Cherry build colour smoothly and as long as you lip line properly, that baby will stay."

AustralianMakeup,399kt3,clairusbearus,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:58:09 2015 UTC,"Ooh, I love dark lips!   Australis Grunge - I find it takes a teensy bit of effort for application to look good, and it doesn't last particularly long, but goddamn it's a good colour. LA Splash Untamed and Nymphadora - I picked these longwear liquids up recently. Again, a bit of work to get them looking good, but the colours are gooooorgeous. Didn't get any insane longevity from them, but did alright until eating. Revlon Colorstay Overtime Ultimate Wine - longwear liquid, not crazy dark but a nice sophisticated-looking colour. Great for winter/autumn looks.   And if you're looking for deep reds at all, I love Bourjois Grand Cru - another longwear liquid (I have a thing for them). Lovelylovelylovely deep beautiful red, get so many comments with this."

AustralianMakeup,398sgn,catrixo,2,Wed Jun 10 04:29:00 2015 UTC,the most irritating thing about shipping from the US is you generally pay a mint of $15+ and you would at least think a tracking code would be included in that. I'm seriously impatient with waiting for things in the mail so I feel you.
AustralianMakeup,398sgn,pinkertongeranium,2,Wed Jun 10 04:31:15 2015 UTC,Sorry guys - I must have gotten the ColourPop shipping confused with another order. I just checked and I paid $16.19 (USD) for shopping with ColourPop. The shipping with Morphe however was more expensive at $20.45 (USD) and clearly much less reliable.
AustralianMakeup,398sgn,pinkertongeranium,2,Wed Jun 10 04:28:31 2015 UTC,"I made a colourpop order a couple of months ago and USPS lost it. So what I did was I lodged a missing postage claim with Australia Post and then contacted colourpop to fix it. Luckily for me Colourpop responded and sent a replacement. When I spoke to Australia Post about I was told that lodging a claim with them is the best first step, they can't do a whole lot if it hasn't reached the country but it can start the process for other parties as well.   Honestly though I'd consider that palette lost in the mail for sure, the tracking for my original order is still saying it's in the same place about 2 months on."

AustralianMakeup,398ld5,breviloquent-,3,Wed Jun 10 01:55:25 2015 UTC,"I used to use NARS Creamy Concealer which was pretty good, but I've recently switched over to MAC Pro Longwear Concealer which is amazing. It doesn't budge, fade, or cake all day. I just checked my face and everywhere I applied it this morning still looks pretty good after about 8 hours.   Coverage is awesome (I use it for redness around my nose, blemishes, and under eyes) without looking heavy or cakey.  As for foundation sponges, I've used the RT (purchased from iHerb) and BB, and I much prefer the BB - so I can't really help you there!"
AustralianMakeup,398ld5,SEXPILUS,2,Wed Jun 10 07:12:56 2015 UTC,"I like the bare minerals concealer. I like it because it is a powder, which means it doesnt cake for me.  My blemishes are around my nose where my skin is quite dry, if I put liquid there it flakes, this goes on really nicely.   The stay power is OK. Its 4pm today and you can kind of see that I have a blemish but its not red or anything. I haven't got setting spray on or anything either."

The highest coverage one I've tried thus far is the 'Australis Go Camo' liquid concealer. This stuff is literally like liquid latex. But because of that fact - it's thick, hard to blend and has a bad shade range so I actually don't use it :(.  At the moment I'm testing out the L.A. Girl Pro concealer which, while nice - seems to have a bit more coverage than the Maybelline Fit Me concealer (which is my go to, but doesn't have enough coverage) but worse yellow tones in it, so I'm not a fan.  Have actually ordered a selection of Korean blemish concealers to see how they compare. But so far, still hunting.  Would love to hear if you find a good one!! :)  EDIT: I set all of my concealers with powder as it seems to nearly double their wear time. Might help you too while you're looking for your holy grail concealer!!"

Maybelline Fit Me in 110 Porcelain might be a good match, but I haven't been able to find it locally, personally.  The lightest shade of the Maybelline Dream Wonder Fluid is also a good match, but the formula isn't one I like (you might).  I also swatched two different Rimmel foundations in Chemist Warehouse today that were perfect matches for me. They were both in glass bottles and were the lightest shades. They weren't the Wake Me Up (the lightest shade is so dark!). Did you try the Match Perfection in Light Porcelain? I believe it was that one and the Lasting Finish in Light Porcelain."

My only concern is that it seems to chew through batteries fairly easily so would recommended two sets of rechargeable batteries (two packs if they come in 4s). The unit takes 3 AA's and generally you can only charge two at a time, so having the extra packet there so you can charge the left over two will come in handy.     That got longer than expected, hope it helps!"
AustralianMakeup,394qbl,assaulted_peanuts,2,Tue Jun 9 07:17:04 2015 UTC,Oh awesome. I was actually considering this one. I still have new batteries to use from the last mirror. But might look into the rechargeable ones. Could I possible get a rough measurement of the mirror. (Can't seem to find how big the mirror is)  Does it have a spot where (if you wanted to) for the power point?  Cause I know that some (like the one I have now) gives you the option to choose between the two.
AustralianMakeup,394qbl,ComingUpMilhouse,1 point,Tue Jun 9 07:22:46 2015 UTC,"Oooh I found the PDF instructions/details :D    Your LED lighted makeup mirror has a 21.5 x 16.5cm oval design head with a 7x/1x magnification.     I can't see anything about having a power supply, just references to batteries. So I think it is unfortunately only battery operated."

The more sales, the more competition the better! I don't buy any of the major 'drugstore' brands anymore unless they're at least 30% off. By taking a minute to look at the catalogues to know where to head for what you want it's easy enough to do. I know some people are happy to willingly pay full price but I can't be the only one who would have to be mad before paying full price anymore either!  https://www.reddit.com/r/AustralianMakeup/comments/37b1rm/didnt_target_only_just_have_a_makeup_sale_like_3/crl9ix3"

I haven't been to the city Target in a while but I know they have a decent range. Northland's Target is okay but always leaves much to be desired. I went to the Flemington one a few weeks ago only to find an extremely small Target with no makeup section at all. Does anyone know what the Highpoint Target is like?"
AustralianMakeup,393qzv,backwards01,3,Tue Jun 9 05:12:32 2015 UTC,Chadstone or Doncaster is usually good.

AustralianMakeup,393qzv,damn-croissants,2,Tue Jun 9 06:42:10 2015 UTC,the cbd one has a good sized nyx display but can often be a bit lacking in product. i went in a few weeks ago and it must have just been restocked because it was pretty full but i've seen it almost empty too.
AustralianMakeup,393qzv,spooknat,2,Tue Jun 9 05:34:15 2015 UTC,Cool thanks for the heads up. I'm only about 20mins from the cbd so still probably worth checking out. My go-to (northland) has a very limited range and is often out of stock.

AustralianMakeup,390opa,neccessarygirl,8,Mon Jun 8 11:47:14 2015 UTC,Bourjois healthy mix serum foundation!  It is so natural and light but you can build it up in any areas you want slightly more coverage. Lisa Eldridge has a video where she shows the healthy mix foundation (the 'serum' one I used is better for dry skins and slightly more sheer) and reccomends it. I feel like it's $32 in Priceline but I've bought it quite a few times on a 2 for 1 sale there so maybe hold out for one of those! :)
AustralianMakeup,390opa,Agelfling,3,Tue Jun 9 01:24:10 2015 UTC,I use just the regular healthy mix (I have oily skin) and I love it for everyday wear! You can also buy it from ASOS for $19.50 from memory.
AustralianMakeup,390opa,reddit-g,3,Tue Jun 9 03:03:21 2015 UTC,"Seconding buying anything Bourjois from ASOS, if you can make the shipping minimum!  Edit: I also really like the Regular Healthy Mix as an everyday foundation! I think it has a good medium coverage (definitely not high) and it looks really natural too!"
AustralianMakeup,390opa,ailee612,4,Tue Jun 9 09:27:29 2015 UTC,"I wear MAC Face and Body and love it. It's definitely not heavy coverage, but is perfect for evening out my skin tone while still looking like I'm not wearing anything, then I put a bit of concealer over any blemishes"
AustralianMakeup,390opa,kochipoik,3,Mon Jun 8 20:21:44 2015 UTC,"Check out the Estee Lauder Double Wear Range. They have a light cover version that may hit the target. I have the original version which is supposed to be medium/full cover, but I find it pretty easy to get a sheer coverage if I apply it lightly and go nuts with a beauty blender. It has a better colour range than the light version, good ivory shades in warm, neutral and cool tones."
AustralianMakeup,390opa,pootlepower,3,Mon Jun 8 13:49:06 2015 UTC,"My every day drugstore HG foundation is Rimmel Match Perfection liquid. It's so cheap, has a wonderful texture, staying power and the colour I use is my exact match (Fair Porcelain for cool toned skin - I'm an NC15 in MAC, for reference). I save my MAC and other foundations for special occasions and just use Rimmel on a daily basis for work and uni :)"
AustralianMakeup,390opa,seaofdreamsx,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:36:54 2015 UTC,I love how that one looks and feels but it breaks me out so badly :(

AustralianMakeup,390opa,jamballdonut,3,Tue Jun 9 11:43:45 2015 UTC,"Would highly recommend the Revlon Nearly Naked foundation! I'm pretty pale (NW15) and 110 Ivory looks a little too light for me! It's suuuuper light coverage, but enough to even out my skintone and make it look like my skin, but better.  It doesn't oxidise, it wears nicely, and just all in all, it is literally the best foundation I've ever used (& I've tried a lot!)"
AustralianMakeup,390opa,trailerparkgurl,2,Tue Jun 9 00:58:46 2015 UTC,I love L'Oreal foundations! True Match and Infallible are both super long lasting with great buildable coverage.
AustralianMakeup,390opa,imwittier,2,Mon Jun 8 19:09:07 2015 UTC,"True match gave me zero coverage, practically wiped off, and didnt last at all :( I heard such good things I really wanted to like it. However, I got a yellow toned one so I add it to too-pink foundations and it mixes well."
AustralianMakeup,390opa,afropowers_activate,2,Wed Jun 10 00:58:58 2015 UTC,"Seconding this! I wear True Match or Lumi Magique almost daily, they're also spf 17 IIRC. If I'm having a really good skin day or I'm going to be outside though I go with Chi Chi CC Cream as it's spf30+ and light coverage but covers my redness really well. All three last all day on me."
AustralianMakeup,390opa,sophietan,2,Tue Jun 9 00:06:40 2015 UTC,"If I'm having a good skin day I love the bareminerals complexion rescue but it doesn't provide much coverage!   I have olive skin so I have been LOVING the EX1 invisiwear foundation! Previously I was using the benefit hello flawless foundation. I really love that one too. It's a light-medium coverage (I only use a single pump for my whole face) but definitely buildable if you want a little more coverage.   I also like the L'Oréal true match as it feels light, but that's more medium-full coverage. So I'd wear that one for a ""nicer"" everyday foundation (like if you're going out for lunch or something)   Hope this helps!"

AustralianMakeup,390opa,sophietan,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:00:34 2015 UTC,"The complexion rescue isn't that buildable, if I feel like i need more coverage I usually use a powder foundation on top haha.   Benefit you can go to most Myers and they'll have a counter, you can ask them to colour match you and you can see if you like the coverage/see how it wears throughout the day and purchase it if you like! I think adorebeauty.com.au stock benefit as well so if you want to purchase it online you can try there :)"

AustralianMakeup,390opa,knn328,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:40:53 2015 UTC,"bare minerals!! i believe their original foundation runs at $35, it's mineral makeup so it'll let your skin breathe if you dont like wearing much foundation. coverage can be built up starting from light (with a light hand) to very full coverage with layering. it's a very natural skin-like finish and it's actually quite water resistant. rather than falling apart after a day, i find it actually LOOKS BETTER the longer you wear it for :)    also, urban decay naked skin is a very good alternative to sheer glow. runs in at about $56 i believe and also has a very good shade range. the lightest (1.0 warm/1.5 cool) shades are quite light, i'd say nc10-15ish. it's a medium coverage, matte finish but the coverage can be sheered out by using a sponge or stippling brush for application. it's VERY lightweight on the skin, true to its name it really does feel like your naked skin :) the foundation lasts on me for about 7-8 hours before it visibly starts breaking up around the nose."

Ever once in a while I try something else (just because I run out or because of curiosity) but I always come back. It's relatively cheap, nothing nasty, even the most sensitive and acne-prone skin can use it and it comes in 3 different formulations. They also have a great range of colours and you can buy samples to try it out first. I think their shipping to Australia is still $8 standard, but you might want to check that for yourself."

I completely forgot to snap some pics or take note of the prices though.  The sales assistant told me that they'd only gotten them in last week. I do think the prices are more reasonable than Priceline will be though, because I remember eyeing the RT Sculpting Set which was $33.95 which isn't too bad considering iherb sells it for $26.35 and if you don't meet the free shipping quota it's $4 shipping. A look at their website also shows that they sell the RT Eyes Starter Set for $23.95 compared to Priceline's $45. :)  Here's a link to their FB page in case anyone is interested. It does say that they're getting them direct from the US. No idea how much stock they have, but if you're in Sydney and interested definitely go check it out if you don't want to wait for Priceline or iherb to get them in!  Personally I'm not really interested in these brushes. The shapes aren't anything that I need, and at those prices (I do remember one of the brushes was ~$45) I would rather save up to buy Hakuhodo brushes at IMATS this year. Also, I'm short sighted and the handles are very long which I'm not keen on since I need to get up pretty close to the mirror to do my makeup!

AustralianMakeup,38sd6c,ComingUpMilhouse,1 point,Sun Jun 7 03:07:22 2015 UTC,Do you know if the Hakuhodo brushes will be on 'sale' at IMATS? I read somewhere that they were 20% off last year! After reading your comment I went on a massive research on the Hakuhodo brushes and now I need some haha!
AustralianMakeup,38sd6c,mononooke,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:39:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure, sorry! :( I know most things at IMATS are usually around 20% off retail, but I don't know for sure on Hakuhodo. I've never been to IMATS before, but I am super excited to go this year! I think even if it's not on sale, it will be worth it to be able to see and touch the brushes before you buy (if you can wait until November haha)."
AustralianMakeup,38sd6c,chocolatespeckle,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:57:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's definitely worth it! I've never even heard of IMATS until I read your comment but I'm pretty excited haha! I think I can wait lol, but I'll have to even if I can't lol"
AustralianMakeup,38r2yj,DarkPhoenix1993,8,Sat Jun 6 02:24:42 2015 UTC,"The Australis ready set go is the loose translucent finishing powder and it's my holy grail. I have horrifyingly oily skin and this is the one product that's kept it at bay for the longest.   I know a lot of people on this sub love the fresh & flawless pressed powder, I personally hated it. It looked nothing but cakey on me and once my oiliness kicked in it became 1000x worse - they're both loved around here though and plenty of people don't find it to be cakey etc - if you can get them on special why not try both? :-)"
AustralianMakeup,38r2yj,Jessijames,2,Sat Jun 6 03:18:11 2015 UTC,"I second this entire post!   OP: I am a Mont Blanc in Nars Sheer Glow and the Australis Fresh and Flawless looked awful on me, very orange and cakey. However, the loose finishing powder looks AMAZING, looks very natural but still controls oil. I'm currently using Stay Matte but will be going back to my Australis when I run out!"
AustralianMakeup,38r2yj,neccessarygirl,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:29:39 2015 UTC,"Also to add, I am a winter Siberia, summer Mont Blanc and the lightest Fresh & Flawless was also quite dark/orange on me."

AustralianMakeup,38r2yj,jamballdonut,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:46:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, me too! I am guessing it's supposed to be lighter, it might just work for me as a light touch up or something if it's a better colour match!! However, if it is lighter why they went for 'light beige' as the shade name rather than 'ivory' or something is beyond me hahaha"
AustralianMakeup,38r2yj,Jessijames,2,Sat Jun 6 03:51:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Australis confirmed in a Facebook comment that it's now the lightest, but I'm thinking they did ""Light Beige"" because they probably realise it isn't THAT light, and it means they can bring out an ivory/porcelain in the future, hahaah"

AustralianMakeup,38r2yj,torple-,1 point,Sat Jun 6 05:32:21 2015 UTC,I think that's exactly me! I got Mont Blanc in summer but now that it's colder I need to go to Siberia. Now to save up for it and the concealer...
AustralianMakeup,38r2yj,breviloquent-,2,Sat Jun 6 05:46:07 2015 UTC,I actually love the fresh and flawless! It doesn't cake up or look dry on me which is amazing because I am as dry as the desert and everything (including foundations for dry skin) makes me look like crap
AustralianMakeup,38r2yj,Jessijames,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:54:32 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'll definitely look into the Ready Set Go :-) I've never had a loose powder before - any tips for using it? I've tried one before but the powder just flies everywhere :P
AustralianMakeup,38r2yj,mustuseallthegifs,2,Sat Jun 6 05:47:41 2015 UTC,"I open the lid very carefully and very slowly and that way I have minimal powder cloud haha because it's so finely milled it's not really avoidable alltogether, but I just gently shake it gently once or twice while keeping it right side up (with the lid on) to get some powder through the sifter and boom good to go!"
AustralianMakeup,38r2yj,cowboy_dog,1 point,Sat Jun 6 06:09:08 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but here are my tips:  A little bit of this powder goes a long way. It's pretty much undetectable on the skin and it gives such a beautiful soft, matte finish. If I have to have my makeup on for a long period of time (10 hours plus) I pack the powder on with a damp beauty blender and let it 'bake', and wipe away the excess a little while later. It's the best thing I've found at making my makeup stay in place and making sure nothing creases on me.  Like any loose powder you just need to be careful when opening it and make sure you store it on a flat surface. It's not really a powder you can bring with you in your handbag without it getting everywhere, however, I find I don't need to re-powder during the day when I'm using it.  The only issue I have with this powder is that because it's a Silica powder it creates horrible flashback in photographs. If you're really careful with application and really wipe away any excess it can look okay in flash photography, but it's usually easier to just have another powder like Rimmel Stay Matt on hand for those occasions."
AustralianMakeup,38r2yj,mustuseallthegifs,1 point,Sat Jun 6 06:07:12 2015 UTC,Do you get the powder off the lid or on top of the sifter?
AustralianMakeup,38r2yj,Dtapped,1 point,Sat Jun 6 10:18:42 2015 UTC,"I get a tiny bit of powder from the container, then swirl the brush in the lid and then tap off the excess. A little bit goes a really long way with this powder."
AustralianMakeup,38r2yj,itwaswonderful,1 point,Sat Jun 6 11:24:43 2015 UTC,"I have to say this is one of the only Australis products I can't work with. I thought I'd love it, but found it too shimmery. It accentuates under eye circles if you have high cheek bones. I wore it out once and noticed a visible difference then immediately retired it."
AustralianMakeup,38r2yj,burnt_can,2,Sat Jun 6 16:50:11 2015 UTC,I've found that using a pressed powder over my foundation usually makes me skin look cakey. What I do like is using a translucent loose powder like the Face of Australia powder to lightly dust over my foundation to set it. This is a much more thin layer than a pressed powder and really helps with the cakey-ness.
AustralianMakeup,38r2yj,violetbang,1 point,Sat Jun 6 06:09:55 2015 UTC,"I like Kyrolans loose setting powder in transparent. it comes in a large container and lasts a long time, and is milled to a texture which isn't too fine or too thick, so it applies evenly."
AustralianMakeup,38r2yj,deathcabforkatie_,1 point,Sun Jun 7 08:20:34 2015 UTC,"NYX translucent setting powder is really great. You only need a tiny bit on a fluffy brush for your whole face, I've had mine for a long time and am still not close to finished. Will definitely buy again though."

AustralianMakeup,38qq0d,breviloquent-,2,Sat Jun 6 01:36:51 2015 UTC,I think Doo-bai wears a bit better than budapesh but they're both slightly patchy so keep it on you when you're out for reapplication and exfoliate your lips prior.
AustralianMakeup,38qq0d,merciful_death,2,Sat Jun 6 03:29:11 2015 UTC,"Doo Bai is slightly less patchy, but both wear fine on me.  Just keep them for touch ups :) There's not a massive amount of difference in the colours, but I do find I reach for Doobai more than Buda pash"

I am not that experienced at using them so I'm sure I'll get better with practice but at the moment I find both colours more frustrating than anything. I also have Pa-ree, Ny-cee and Bar-tha-lona and find those formulas much easier to work with."
AustralianMakeup,38qq0d,ex_circus_geek,1 point,Sun Jun 7 13:45:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks peeps, I ended up wearing Doo-bai. It was soooooooo dry and felt ""patchy"" even though it didn't look it (I kept checking as I was sure it was flaking off) which was odd. About 4 hours in I had a lot of fading on the inner parts of my lip and some unevenness so I topped it up with my mum's cherry cordial from Gerard cosmetics (do not reccomend, dry AF). I keep buying them but the only shades that have ever worked for me are the 3 ac/me ones and the light pink one of which the name escapes me atm.   Will be buying lipcote and thanks for everyone's opinions/advice/input!"

AustralianMakeup,38is28,HRM_Monster,3,Fri Jun 5 00:23:46 2015 UTC,"This looks lovely, I love gold highlighters! I'm pale skinned and not sure if I can rock the pale gold though... not after the travesty that occurred today - this morning I actually had some time to dab highlighter on my cheekbones while getting ready for work, about lunchtime my good friend who I also work with notices and said ""there's something off with your face today, you got yellow around your eyes."" I didn't get it so she made my take my glasses off to look closer. It finally clicked in my head about a minute later and I laughed ""that's my highlighter!"" Suffix to say, I'd probably suit a silver hued highlight.."
AustralianMakeup,38is28,spooknat,1 point,Fri Jun 5 07:23:23 2015 UTC,I love a gold highlight but it doesn't work for me. I'm very pale and prefer a cool toned pinky silver highlight. The models prefer mineral powder soft touch  in photo ready is awesome for me. It gives a subtle sheen which works for day. I sometimes use it under my bb cream as my powder of choice for the Wayne Goss method. Benefits girl meets pearl is a good liquid highlight for my colouring as well. Hope this helps
AustralianMakeup,38is28,HRM_Monster,2,Mon Jun 8 03:00:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks for you input! Funny you should mention that, I was just in Priceline yesterday (ran out of shampoo and other necessaries) and decided to scope out the makeup aisle for fun, I stopped at Models Prefer and remembered how everyone raves about their soft touch powders and wanted to grab one but there wasn't any left and/or I couldn't even find the section for it at all. Weird. I have Physicians Formula translucent pearl highlighter which is nice but I do find it to be on the glittery side, esp for daily wear. How do the soft touch stack up? I will try another Priceline if you do recommend it!"
AustralianMakeup,38is28,spooknat,2,Mon Jun 8 04:54:10 2015 UTC,"I well and truly recommend it. I use it daily and swear by it. The soft touch is not glittery and down right beautiful. I love it for a quick , natural/not overly the top highlight for day time. I sometimes layered it a bit more heavily for formal or night situations or just swap to something a bit more glittery. Sometimes I set my bb cream with a light sheer layer when I want a glowy look. My sister uses a more warmer/yellow toned soft touch powder and it works fantastically for her. I use it a fair bit and it's still in good nick with tons left. The amount of product is decent for the price :)"
AustralianMakeup,38is28,HRM_Monster,2,Mon Jun 8 05:01:18 2015 UTC,Ooh this gives me hope! I was wanting more of a glow-from-within sheen and this sounds perfect. I like that you can use it as a finishing powder or a concentrated highlight. Thank you so much! I must give it a go :)
AustralianMakeup,38is28,spooknat,2,Mon Jun 8 05:52:15 2015 UTC,"You are welcome, I love this sub :) I am deathly cool toned pale so it works for me as a setting powder, it might vary for you if you look more alive than me :P My advice is to go very light if you use if for a setting powder. If you need a heavy duty setting powder for oil control just pop the soft touch powder on after that. Have a play with the colours to find which one suits you. Best of luck :)"

I got Vindictive from beauty joint, and when LA Splash had a $10 international shipping sale, I got Venom, Nagini and Sirius.  So far I love them! I haven't worn them out yet (bedridden from back pain) but I have swatched them all and worn Venom around the house. It took about a minute to dry, but was completely matte and opaque in one thin coat. The only other liquid lippies I have are Australis and MeNow(eBay). LA Splash is like velourlips but not patchy, and not sticky like MeNow. The swatches lasted on the back of my hand until the next morning. They aren't any more drying than other matte lip products, I don't think.  I definitely recommend them, but I wouldn't pay full price shipping... $27.95 or whatever is just insane."

I also have Stila's Stay All Day Liquid Lipstick in Patina, and out of all the liquid lipsticks I have tried, I think LA Splash is the best quality.  I have eaten a full meal of Japanese karaage chicken curry and cider drink whilst wearing Ghoulish, and there was no transfer or loss of product on my lips (my boyfriend was also very enthusiastic in testing how kiss proof the lipstick is - and the lipstick passed the test!).  I also want to mention, if you haven't tried the MeNow liquid lipsticks, I'd give them a go too - their 'no-budge-ability' is really quite comparable to LA Splash. You may be interested in #33, which I swatched in this post."

I wore the Australis out to a party yesterday night and was definitely disappointed - didn't hold up to eating pizza and having a few drinks. It also faded disappointingly patchy and made my lips so dry. Definitely on the look out for a better product

AustralianMakeup,38d3k1,LemonStealingBoar,3,Thu Jun 4 09:36:09 2015 UTC,"Sweeeeeet I've been wanting the blush brush, complexion sponge and the new sculpting set ages! Anyone in Brisbane want to put in on an order?"
AustralianMakeup,38d3k1,firsttimemidwife,2,Thu Jun 4 07:04:35 2015 UTC,Thank you for this.   Was so tempted to buy the sculpting set. But I already had the RT setting brush so it wasn't worth it. But I did get the sculpting brush by itself.
AustralianMakeup,38d3k1,DarkHatexx,1 point,Thu Jun 4 10:42:46 2015 UTC,I was just debating buying myself some for my birthday which was on Tuesday... what would you recommend I get?
AustralianMakeup,38d3k1,Spitefultongue,4,Wed Jun 3 17:06:40 2015 UTC,"What kind of brushes are you looking for?  If you're just starting out I really like the core collection. It's pretty good value and I use really like the contour brush as a multi-use brush; both for contouring but also for setting my undereye concealer. It's probably one of my favourite brushes in my entire brush collection, because it also works for highlight and blush.   The buffer brush I really like for foundation; some people like it better than the expert face brush!   I have to be honest and say I don't really like the pointed foundation brush, it's a bit too small and if used for foundation I find it gives me streaks unless you press the foundation in rather than ""painting"" my face as such. The detailer brush I also didn't know how to use, but I like using it as a small detail brush for eyeshadow! I wouldn't recommend it for concealer.  The only other brush I think is a must-have from them is the Blush brush! It's really good for diffuse placement of blush."
AustralianMakeup,38d3k1,ailee612,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:28:22 2015 UTC,"Mostly wanting brushes for eye makeup, I don't like foundation heavy enough for a foundation brush but I think a sponge/beauty blender is a good idea."
AustralianMakeup,38d3k1,Spitefultongue,2,Thu Jun 4 07:25:10 2015 UTC,The brush collection for eyes from real techniques is decent enough - I  tend to get the most use out of the blending brush. I don't use the pointed fine brush or slanted angle brush often at all. I'd look at the Ecotools eye brush collections; I think there's a 6 piece one that I found great for the price.
AustralianMakeup,38d3k1,szarkasm,1 point,Thu Jun 4 11:11:56 2015 UTC,"I have some eco tools brushes and I found that the fibers got quite course after a few weeks of using them. Anyway, I got the RT eye set and the contouring set. Woo!"
AustralianMakeup,38d3k1,Spitefultongue,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:56:41 2015 UTC,"Oh really, I haven't had that experience with any of my eco tools brushes. Was this just from use or after washing? That's unfortunate, my eco tools still feel as soft as the day I bought them :("
AustralianMakeup,38d3k1,szarkasm,1 point,Sun Jun 7 13:23:48 2015 UTC,I would also probably recommend the ecotools brushes over real techniques ones... they're a bit cheaper and I think they feel a bit softer. I really like the double-ended set from them!
AustralianMakeup,38d3k1,ailee612,2,Thu Jun 4 12:39:45 2015 UTC,If you dont already own a beauty blender then their sponge is a great product!

AustralianMakeup,38bxzl,Ivegonewrong,1 point,Wed Jun 3 11:56:46 2015 UTC,"Looks a decent size. Almost big enough for my overnight gear to chuck in a backpack. The question is, how good was the makeup?"
AustralianMakeup,38bxzl,Ivegonewrong,2,Wed Jun 3 13:24:59 2015 UTC,Good question!  I only have the bronzer and I'm happy enough with it. Picked up the AC On Tour and some nail polish. Haven't tried either yet.
AustralianMakeup,38bxzl,duccy_duc,2,Wed Jun 3 14:14:41 2015 UTC,Awesome. I haven't had Australis for many years which is why I asked. Then again I only really use concealer now so unless they have/include more basic stuff like sunscreen base I might not make the $25...
AustralianMakeup,38bxzl,Ivegonewrong,2,Wed Jun 3 14:31:44 2015 UTC,"Only concealer?! Sounds like a lovely and simple way to live. I think I've seen people around here rating the Australis primer, and the velourlips (I bought one myself, but my experience is nothing to go by because I am totally clueless with lip products!)  The nail polishes are $5 each, which was handy for me because I have no nail polish- although I'm not sure what the quality will be like."
AustralianMakeup,38bxzl,Suriiiiiii,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:38:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, usually I skip the concealer and just wear sunscreen. I'm incredibly lazy. The primers and glosses look nice though"

AustralianMakeup,38cp8k,breviloquent-,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:59:26 2015 UTC,did she go to Love those Lashes in Paddington? Because my aesthetician use to work there and she said they had Jennifer Hawkins as a client. I'm guessing that's gotta mean something!
AustralianMakeup,38brml,Jessijames,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:53:57 2015 UTC,Yep! Blue Peep was made permanent with the other shades in Mac is Beauty - not 100% sure about Royal Wink although I'm fairly certain we still have it on counter too

AustralianMakeup,387gcq,reddit-g,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:40:53 2015 UTC,"or maybe Mecca Maxima since they carry more high end products like by Terry. Either way, bye bye savings account...."
AustralianMakeup,387gcq,starwish216,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:59:30 2015 UTC,Yeah true. I also kind of feel like Mecca maybe cares more about bringing brands out here than DJs?
AustralianMakeup,387gcq,reddit-g,3,Thu Jun 4 07:42:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I feel that way too. They did bring in UD but I feel like that was so they could be one step ahead in case Sephora brought it in and take the business. Now that UD is exclusive to Mecca, Sephora isn't allow to stock it. If Charlotte Tilbury goes to Mecca, I wonder if they'll make it one of their exclusive brands as well..."
AustralianMakeup,387gcq,starwish216,2,Thu Jun 4 10:42:17 2015 UTC,Maybe! But the whole hype around Sephora has really deflated... And what happened to a Melbourne store? I kind of don't even really consider them competition at this point.
AustralianMakeup,387gcq,reddit-g,3,Thu Jun 4 11:28:23 2015 UTC,"I think the Melb store is put on the backburner because the Syd store isn't turning the profit that they expected. Everyone was losing their shits when Sephora promised to price match US and no markups but when they actually got here, some of the prices were pretty steep and you could get cheaper online. They also have a pretty limited selection. I think that's why the hype deflated so quickly."
AustralianMakeup,387gcq,starwish216,2,Thu Jun 4 23:09:26 2015 UTC,"All true points… I also noticed the other day they're still getting really abysmal reviews on Facebook. That ""we're going to price match the U.S."" claim may have been the most damaging thing for them here."
AustralianMakeup,387gcq,reddit-g,3,Fri Jun 5 03:02:39 2015 UTC,This is so exciting I LOVE CT stuff. I hope an actual counter makes it to Brisbane!

AustralianMakeup,387e66,tanoshiiki,2,Tue Jun 2 11:31:20 2015 UTC,Those are some bizarre product photos and I recommend their glitter polishes.

AustralianMakeup,387e66,ChemicalZebra,3,Tue Jun 2 12:50:51 2015 UTC,I've tried it and it's really gross. Super thick and hard to blend and strongly scented. I wouldn't recommend it at all.

AustralianMakeup,384sob,missb00,3,Tue Jun 2 01:55:55 2015 UTC,It'll probably be around $80 like the others :(
AustralianMakeup,384sob,lanadelghey,2,Tue Jun 2 03:11:46 2015 UTC,"I wonder how far after the initial release we'll get it, too. Don't wanna wait 6 months!"
AustralianMakeup,384sob,missb00,1 point,Tue Jun 2 11:08:15 2015 UTC,Or like... Years like the others! Companies seem to be a bit quicker on making things available here these days! Hopefully soon the space between available in US and AUS will be non existent. A girl can dream...
AustralianMakeup,384sob,lanadelghey,2,Tue Jun 2 11:10:04 2015 UTC,"Well I'm hoping it's not staggered like, for example, movie releases. We actually have UD in Australia now, so hopefully it'll be here quickly after the initial US release. If it comes too much later I'll be too cranky to bother buying it. We girls always get the short straw :("
AustralianMakeup,384sob,missb00,1 point,Tue Jun 2 11:23:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah exactly! I haven't got a Naked palette yet, so I'm not sure which one I want. But I'd like to have all four options!

AustralianMakeup,384sob,missb00,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:35:14 2015 UTC,I'd say they'll be at Mecca but I'm fairly sure they're not released yet. Look at Lauren Curtis' Haul Video and skip to the pinky coloured compacts. SO CUTE.
AustralianMakeup,384sob,lanadelghey,2,Tue Jun 2 22:49:18 2015 UTC,I'll have to remember to take a look when I get home!   Also I'm just hoping they're at Mecca not long after US Sephora etc gets them.
AustralianMakeup,384sob,missb00,2,Tue Jun 2 23:25:53 2015 UTC,"Well they seem to be sending them to Aus/NZ gurus as well as American ones so I'm super hopeful. And it's Mecca sending the packages so I reckon it'll be Mecca that stocks them. Which works for me, no sephora near me :("
AustralianMakeup,384sob,lanadelghey,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:05:57 2015 UTC,Hey! Mecca Maxima told me that it's coming out 25/08 and will be $78 :)
AustralianMakeup,384sob,_lamb,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:22:57 2015 UTC,"I will admit, I do actually enjoy this palette now that I keep looking at it, but I think because I already own so many other similar palettes it won't be worth it or me.  If I didn't own many others, I'd probably jump on it straight away!"
AustralianMakeup,384sob,missb00,1 point,Tue Jun 2 09:34:37 2015 UTC,"I fell in love with it at first sight, but you're right in that a lot of colours are similar to the Lorac Pro 2, which I own. Still, it's not another neutral palette (which I have tons of) and since I've yet to drop the money on a Naked, it looks like this might be the one for me."
AustralianMakeup,384sob,starwish216,8,Tue Jun 2 11:07:24 2015 UTC,"I feel like these are all colours we've seen before or can get elsewhere (Lorac Pro 2, for example).  Also heard it was meant to be all matte, so although that was just a rumour from someone, I'm kind of disappointed that it isn't all matte, because I LOVE matte palettes.  Altogether, probably just going to get the Lorac Pro 2, and skip this one!"
AustralianMakeup,384sob,IronicallyNamedCat,4,Mon Jun 1 21:21:10 2015 UTC,"I agree, in terms of quality, lorac is usually better than UD as well. I wonder if someone will do a Lorac 2 and UD naked smokey swatch comparison."
AustralianMakeup,384sob,5tefanie,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:37:08 2015 UTC,"I find that I tend to prefer Lorac over UD as well, but where does one get Lorac in Australia?  I've only been able to pick it up in the US when I'm visiting family.  Sorry, I'm new(ish) to this."
AustralianMakeup,384sob,pootlepower,3,Tue Jun 2 06:04:53 2015 UTC,"You don't have to get Lorac from overseas. I ordered the Lorac Unzipped palette from myqt.com (Australian-owned) and it arrived the next day, they ship as fast as Mecca!"
AustralianMakeup,384sob,duccy_duc,2,Tue Jun 2 08:18:09 2015 UTC,"You have to order them from overseas, unfortunately. The best places to get it from are Nordstrom and Amazon."

Most of the time after adding something to my cart and filling in my info, it then tells me it either can't ship to Australia or the shipping is wildly expensive.  Have they introduced filters for all this crap yet?"
AustralianMakeup,384sob,chinaamaris,1 point,Wed Jun 3 06:31:11 2015 UTC,"Generally if you click on an item, it'll tell you ""This item does/does not ship to [city], Australia"" under the information of the item, but I've honestly never bought off of Amazon, so no idea other than that!"
AustralianMakeup,384sob,Jessijames,1 point,Wed Jun 3 07:43:49 2015 UTC,"Honestly it's quite a complicated process - you need to make an account with Amazon, then fill in your address details, select some sort of filtering options. Once you're logged in, there's a filter by ""Ships to Australia"" option when you search. So yes, technically they've introduced filters for international shipping."
AustralianMakeup,384sob,WarlockPanda,5,Thu Jun 4 11:15:01 2015 UTC,I feel like for something that will be like $50 USD and $80 AUD its just not that exciting.  its like naked 2 2.0 lol
AustralianMakeup,384sob,ComingUpMilhouse,5,Mon Jun 1 23:06:06 2015 UTC,"Someone also made this comment on the MUA thread with potential dupes for the shades, so if you already have any/all of the Naked palettes, I'm thinking this probably won't be worth it either   High: Stila Kitten, UD Naked Sin or Virgin, Coastal Scents   Revealed 2 light pinky nude (sorry they don't have names)  Dirtysweet: UD Naked 1 Half Baked  Radar: Mac Woodwinked, UD Naked Smog, Too Faced Totally Toasted  Armor: UD Naked Gunmetal  Slanted: UD Naked Gunmetal  Dagger: UD Naked 3 Darkside  Black Market: I don't have a matte black, but UD Naked Creep is the closest.

AustralianMakeup,384sob,Sleiphy,5,Mon Jun 1 22:25:32 2015 UTC,This looks...incredibly mediocre and filled with colours I seldom use. Pass for me!
AustralianMakeup,384sob,duccy_duc,5,Mon Jun 1 22:45:54 2015 UTC,"I agree. The last 6 colours look like they came directly from the UD smokey palette.

AustralianMakeup,385dxj,pyjamasquid,1 point,Tue Jun 2 11:02:08 2015 UTC,"I can't comment on Zoeva makeup (although their brushes are fantastic) but OP, if you have the money now and you want the palette, Lipstick Republic - an Australian retailer - has it up for preorder! It's still kind of expensive, but I know there are various 10% off codes for the site floating around somewhere."

AustralianMakeup,381oow,LemonStealingBoar,2,Mon Jun 1 05:22:09 2015 UTC,Yay! I picked up a Mary-Lou and Cindy-Lou Manizer :) Pretty pleased since I waited too long to get them from my local DJs and now the whole stand has disappeared too. Thought I should grab them while I could from ASOS!
AustralianMakeup,381oow,chocolatespeckle,2,Mon Jun 1 07:50:52 2015 UTC,I really like Mary Lou.  Also if anyone sees this from Brisbane and is willing to throw  these cat nail stickers in their order for me I'd be ever so appreciative. I am trying to no-buy so I cannot really justify finding $40 worth for free shipping when I only really want cat stickers.
AustralianMakeup,382nr1,neccessarygirl,2,Mon Jun 1 12:29:34 2015 UTC,"i really love foam toners and they helped the most with my brassiness. igora expert mousse by schwarzkopf and goldwell colorance were my faves. if youre a light blonde, iceflower by Igora is insanely good (http://www.salonshoponline.com.au/shop/salon/colour/colour-referesher/Igora-Expert-Mousse-95-1-Iceflower/) otherwise match to your hair level (goldwell have lots of colours too). they are found at price attack and hairhouse warehouse etc. bonus is that they did damage my hair or dry it out, i believe theyre actually conditioning. personally- i'd shampoo, condition, and then leave it in for 45 mins, and then rinse."
AustralianMakeup,382nr1,gospursgo_,2,Mon Jun 1 13:09:35 2015 UTC,YASSSSSSSSS the Igora mousse. This stuff is a godsend!!!!! Iceflower was my jam when I was blonde.
AustralianMakeup,382nr1,Jessijames,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:47:03 2015 UTC,"I might try leaving my Fudge in for 10 - 15 minutes next time and if I don't see in change I might pick up the Igora Mousse because my hair is quite dry so that is an extra incentive.   I don't really know what my hair level is because they don't actually bleach my hair (I know nothing about hair so I don't know how it works but my hairdresser has specifically said she won't put bleach in my hair because it's long, thick and it's already dry)  Thank you!"
AustralianMakeup,382nr1,Jessijames,5,Mon Jun 1 13:14:49 2015 UTC,"Be careful doing this with the fudge, when I was super light/white blonde I actually stained my hair purple but leaving the fudge in particular on too long!"
AustralianMakeup,382nr1,Jessijames,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:47:38 2015 UTC,I can't get fudge to tone even a little bit so I'd probably prefer purple than the yellow I've still got. Don't really get the fuss about it :(
AustralianMakeup,382nr1,gospursgo_,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:57:44 2015 UTC,"Fudge only worked for me when my hair was the lightest whitest icy ashy blonde I could get it. It would help maintain that a little longer but was never a miracle fixer. Seriously, check out the Igora by Schwarzkopf or go and buy a level 9 and developer from hairhouse warehouse and do a proper toner yourself. They can tell you what you'll need and how to use it!"
AustralianMakeup,382nr1,sailorgloom,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:28:34 2015 UTC,"i found purple shampoos were quite drying , and the hair needed to be quite light for them to work. but yeah, those mousses were a god send! the people instore should be able to recommenced you a colour to work with your hair :)"
AustralianMakeup,382nr1,gospursgo_,2,Mon Jun 1 13:38:25 2015 UTC,"Purple shampoos work by opening the hair 'pores' and staining colour into them. They're not only drying, but if used too much without proper aftercare they can actually be damaging."

AustralianMakeup,382nr1,crazy-fishlady,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:59:38 2015 UTC,"Any thing that you put on to make it ashy will eventually fade/wash it :( (hence why I gave up and dyed mine black lol) but seriously- the mousses, if your hair isn't blonde blonde try going for the level 8 in the mousse, there's a beautiful ashy one I'll get you the number off when I get home :)"

AustralianMakeup,381cz5,neccessarygirl,3,Mon Jun 1 03:27:19 2015 UTC,"good lord i hate tanya burr and her ditz act UGHHHH. agree with JJ about Sharon Farrell, she's actually a professional and is creative unlike lazy Lauren Curtis who is mundane and just...stupid grrrr  Lisa Eldridge goes without saying.   Local perthie 'jodik76' is so great, she's so honest with her in depth reviews too.   missmavendotcom if you like desi perkins is so great and so stunning. (girl crush)  karimamckimmie another aussie who is a total perfectionist <3   RubyGolani also quite detailed in her tutorials (doesnt have the most perfect skin so is relatable!),   annnd easyNeon who is just so creative and is the queen of blending."
AustralianMakeup,381cz5,gospursgo_,5,Mon Jun 1 04:59:58 2015 UTC,"Seconding Lauren Curtis being mundane. As much as I don't like to subscribe to the 'bitchiness' of the youtube community I have to agree with a buttload of her subs that are commenting about how flat and boring she has been of late, just not even caring about what her video's are even about etc One made a great point the other day, watch Lauren's haul video from the promo gratis she was sent from Mecca, then go watch Chloe Morello's - the reactions are vastly different. Lauren just seems so ungrateful!"
AustralianMakeup,381cz5,Jessijames,6,Mon Jun 1 05:29:35 2015 UTC,"my gripe with her began when she'd upload 1 video, say she was going to upload more regularly... then not upload for two weeks. rinse. repeat.   And when she did upload it'd be the SAME goddamn look and she'd say she's stuck in a make up rut yet REFUSE to try any colours that arent her usual nude lipstick/warm crease colour/spider lashes. which really pissed me off because when she showed her mecca pr stuff its like she was disgusted by all the colours that werent her ususal ones. ungrateful much?! (meanwhile, chloe was a sweetheart!) not to mention the total lack of interest that comes through in her videos...quit youtube if you dont like it ffs (oh but how will she afford those expensive cars~) she is just the epitome of laziness, zero effort. /rant :$  edit: this is why i have respect for Shaaanxo, while her content may not be my style at times, she RELIGIOUSLY sticks to her upload schedule of 3 vids/week. WHICH IS CRAZY. kudos to her."
AustralianMakeup,381cz5,gospursgo_,4,Mon Jun 1 06:15:24 2015 UTC,"That's it! I personally don't like Shaaanxo as much as I used to but you're right, she sticks to her schedule and at least tries to bring out different/interesting looks! She doesn't seem as ungrateful/spoiled for sure, much more modest about what she has and what she receives.  I also felt really disgusted at how Lauren turned her nose up at so many of the products - not to mention she still opened half of them anyway when she could have left them packaged and untouched for a giveaway when she knew from the bat it wouldn't be 'her shade' - sheesh!"

AustralianMakeup,381cz5,jamballdonut,3,Sun Jun 14 07:48:17 2015 UTC,"My faves:   Angelica - Met this girl through a YouTube group and she does AMAZING looks, I highly recommend going & subscribing to her, because her looks constantly blow me away! BiohazardousBeauty - Absolutely adorable personality, and does such amazing looks. Chloe Morello - I used to haaaaate her and found her really pretentious, but lately I've just absolutely fallen in love with her, and resubscribed last week.  I went through & binge watched her videos, and she's just great. Emma Pickles - Just adorable and does stunning looks.  Her winged eyeliner is always so perfect Gabriella - I used to love her, but recently she's been doing more tags/hauls than looks, but her old stuff was really good. Glam&Gore - Maybe not exactly what you're looking for, but god damn she is ADORABLE. I love Mykie :33 Jackie Aina - Does looks that can suit anyone (Even though she is darker skinned, and I'm like NW15, I still love love love her videos).  She's also very concise and tells why she's doing certain things.  Always learn something new with her videos! Kathleen Lights - I'm very hot/cold with Kathleen, but she does do nice looks, so thought I'd chuck her in here anyway KitschSnitch - Always love supporting an Aussie! She does great product reviews! Lisa Eldridge - Obviously.  She's a professional makeup artist, so you know she's going to be amazing.  Uses a nice mix of high/low-end, isn't at all sponsored, and does a great mixture of wearable/more dramatic looks. Messy Downunder - Another great Aussie & also a contributor to this sub.  She does a lot of beauty box unboxings, reviews & tutorials RawBeautyKristi - Does fantastic tutorials, even if I don't like her eyebrows, and just has a great personality Shaanxo - This one seems obvious, since most of her channel is tutorials, but I'll chuck her in here too haha Shani Grimmond - Doesn't do as many tutorials, but she's Australian, so at least she mostly talks about products we can buy Sharon Farrell - Always been great.  Very concise, explains what she's doing/why, tries out different looks, uses a decent amount of Aussie-available products. Tati - She is American, so features a LOT of products we can't get, but her hot or nots are really good, and she's mostly honest Vintageortacky - Just a beautiful soul/personality, does amazing looks, seems very genuine.   I'm also a YouTuber, but someone else mentioned me, so I'm just adding this in as an endnote.  Also, yes, I did just go down my subscription manager & choose all my faves, hahaha"
AustralianMakeup,381cz5,Jessijames,4,Mon Jun 1 21:44:54 2015 UTC,"Right now I really adore Goo Roo Beauty. I think she does FANTASTIC reviews, and gives really good honest opinions about the products she does use/review. Even though she's a little older than myself I find her incredibly relate-able and it might sound silly but when I watch her videos I can't help but just smile because her personality is really really lovely!  I also really like Tarababyz at the moment too (don't let the name fool you...she is on top of latest releases, has very broad knowledge and does excellent swatch videos - her collection leave's Shaanxo's to shame).  Sharon Farrell is also wonderful and very knowledgeable and her looks always impress me and give me new ideas.  Also loving Desi Perkins' channel lately too and her style has grown on me. Another older favourite is Laura Vitale (Vitale Style).   I think in the last 6-12 months the content of Chloe Morello's channel has gone up in my opinion, I find I really enjoy her personality now whereas once upon a time IMO she really grated on my nerves and came across a little stiff and not really relatable (dare I say 'up herself') but she's become much more down to earth - and her looks lately I have really been loving!  There are plenty more I do watch but they may fall into that young-hip-borderline immature category you speak of eg. Batalash, Glam & Gore etc but I do think there is still a lot of value in their channels even if they're not totally serious 100% of the time.  Bear in mind, these are my personal tastes at present which do tend to change a lot and they may not be your cup of tea - only sugesstions! :)"
AustralianMakeup,381cz5,gospursgo_,3,Mon Jun 1 03:52:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks!! I like Desi Perkins and I definitely agree about Chloe Morello, I used to be a bit indifferent towards her but I really enjoy her personality and humour. Will definitely check out your other suggestions!"

This is pretty nitpicky though and you've got your shade matched perfectly as is."
AustralianMakeup,37yknu,criti_biti,2,Sun May 31 15:17:10 2015 UTC,Thank you. Yeah I find I constantly reach for full coverage foundation due to acne scars and blemishes  But I really appreciate your feedback
AustralianMakeup,37yknu,deluxecreampuff,2,Sun May 31 15:19:20 2015 UTC,I used to do the same with full coverage foundation and then I decided to go for a light/medium coverage foundation and just use concealer on spots that needed more coverage. The difference it's made has been incredible - have never had so many compliments on my skin.

AustralianMakeup,37xe2o,ehcn,4,Sun May 31 12:36:46 2015 UTC,"While I don't have the mismatched hoods, both my eyes are double lidded but like most double lidded Asians, they're hooded. When I started out one thing I realised is that eyelids are very different which does mean half the time, beauty tutorials don't suit my eyelids since even though they're hooded double lids. When browsing for looks I always type ""asian"" along with what ever like 'asian eyeliner tutorials' or monolidded/hooded eyes.   Basically you want to place shadow over the crease (which I can see you doing already). Get acquainted with your eye socket because  that will became your new 'crease'. Simplfied- the jist of it is you will be placing a lot of colour to fill in that crease since there is not a lot of space as exampled here.  In this example, you can see that the shadow is placed over the crease which has very little space but stops at the socket.   Like the other singlbrokefemale said, Headtotoe has exactly the same issue as you do. Here's an old video to get your started.  Also while I don't use it personally, double eyelid tape would be helpful to create a fake crease to match your lids together. Here's a little youtube video on how to apply.   Also feel free to check into /r/AsianBeauty It's not a subreddit for makeup looks but more on Asian makeup/skincare products. But there seems to be more Asian users over there (maybe that's just me). I find that Asian cosmetics is something that seems to be very well tailored to the Asian market in terms of skin tones(we have yellow undertones that can make buying makeup a tad inconvenient since not all of us are warm toned necessarily). Also there's a not very active sub /r/MonolidMakeup but you can browse what's on for ideas for that eyelid!  I hope I helped and not just rambled on haha."

I believe Sssamantha used 2 of the new Anastasia gel liners for the teal & yellow but I found the new Revlon Photoready Kajal pencils to be very close dupes colour-wise!   The yellow doesn't last so long in the waterline on its own which is a bummer but when I did the look last week I set it with a yellow shadow I had and it really helped (although the shadow was a darker more 'banana' yellow) - I also set the teal with a very similar matte shade from Inglot last week but left it out of this look so I can see how it lasts on it's own on the lid! :)  Product list:   Maybelline Dream Smooth Primer Benefit Fake Up! in 01 - light Maybelline Dream Wonder Fluid-Touch foundation in 10 Porcelain Ivory Life's Entropy Particle Contour Stick in Alpha Maybelline Fit Me pressed powder in 115 Ivory Josie Maran Argan Infinity Lip & Cheek Creamy Oil in Timeless Coral (woah that's a mouthful lol) as both a cheek base & as my lip colour NARS Blush in Oasis The Balm Mary Loumanizer  Benefit Gimmie Brow in Medium-Dark   EYES:   MAC Painterly Paint Pot as a base Blackbird Cosmetics shadow in Half Full all over the lid & brow bone to set Blackbird Cosmetics shadow in Thirteen in the crease Triple Fudge from the Too faced Chocolate Bar palette (very dark cool brown) to lightly deepen crease and slight outer V L'oreal Infallible shadow in Iced latte gently patted all over the lid Revlon photoready Kajal pencil in Matte Marine as a thick liner, very slightly winged out MAC Fluid Line in Blacktrack for the wing & thinly across the rest of the lashline Revlon Photoready Kajal pencil in Matte Lemon in lower lash line Max Factor Lash Extension Effect mascara"

AustralianMakeup,37tfil,WarlockPanda,1 point,Sat May 30 06:54:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks you speckle!! I love that L'oreal shadow, you can make it really nice and subtle but still pack it on for that wow factor. It's a shame though, I got it from Ulta and I don't know if that shade was ever released here :(  & yes, this one is much more wearable for me, You could easily glam it up and deepen the crease for something a littl emore night-time though!"
AustralianMakeup,37tfil,Flippantry,1 point,Sat May 30 06:59:29 2015 UTC,I really like this look. Are those the new Revlon eyeliners that you used?
AustralianMakeup,37tf3k,neccessarygirl,5,Sat May 30 06:21:46 2015 UTC,"I bought it, I don't think it was worth the splurge. It depends on your skin tone I think? I'm quite light, and two of the shades are too dark for me to use, and the other is just meh. I would buy an individual shade rather than all three."
AustralianMakeup,37tf3k,tofu-queen,1 point,Sat May 30 06:23:47 2015 UTC,"I'm quite pale, a Mont Blanc in Nars Sheer Glow. Which shade does work for you?"
AustralianMakeup,37tf3k,tofu-queen,3,Sat May 30 06:32:39 2015 UTC,"The only nice one for me is Dim Light, and even then, it's average. I would look up people with a similar skin tone to you for reviews, and then buy an individual colour. Ethereal Light is supposed to be good for pale people! But yeah, because two of the colours in the ALP are so dark, it isn't worth it if you're pale. One of the shades makes me look pink, and the other makes me look pink-orange, so I'm left with one shade to work with which is also quite pink toned.  I don't use NARS foundation, but I would probably be the same colour if I did, I have cool undertones and Dim Light pulls very pink on me still. I'd look into individuals in Ethereal Light or Diffused Light!"
AustralianMakeup,37tf3k,Tonkie,1 point,Sat May 30 06:37:30 2015 UTC,Thank you so much! I definitely will :)
AustralianMakeup,37tf3k,szarkasm,5,Sat May 30 06:46:41 2015 UTC,"Agree with tofu queen, depending of course on what you want to use it for, pick the colour you particularly want and buy the single. I went from the palette with middle shade nearly finished, dim about 1/3 and radiant almost untouched, to a single of diffused which I use almost every day. I'm Deauville in NARS sheer glow."
AustralianMakeup,37tf3k,ehcn,2,Sat May 30 08:36:48 2015 UTC,"The general trend has been saying the palette itself isn't worth it because it doesn't suit pale skin tones and OP is also pale. However I  suppose I'm here to play devil's advocate and recommend it.    Keep in mind I'm quite a bit darker, sitting around NC35.   I find equal use out of all three shades on my skin tone. The left most (Dim light) is a subtle finishing powder on me and leaves a nice daytime appropriate healthy glow to the skin. Incandescent light is quite cool silvery toned whilst Radiant light is golden warm toned. I use these for more dramatic looks or if I want a more noticeable highlight, and match these depending on whether I used cool or warm toned shades for the rest of my makeup.   I find good use out of all three, but I can appreciate how those who are paler will find Radiant light orange and unflattering. On me though, it's most useful on a beachy bronze glow sort of look and complements gold and bronze eyeshadows really well. If you're around my skin tone, I'd recommend you go in store and try it :)"
AustralianMakeup,37tf3k,amblingodyssey,1 point,Sat May 30 11:49:18 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Anyone who is a bit tanner (I'm a Nars Barcelona or a NC40ish) and reading, don't be discouraged. The colours don't come out too harshly on me. In fact the darkest colour is very subtle on me and provides a nice complimentary glow when paired with my bronzer (both are very subtle on my face). I love this palette and I found it well worth the price. It's all a matter of skin tones. :)"
AustralianMakeup,37tf3k,placenta_resenter,1 point,Sun May 31 09:50:39 2015 UTC,"I think it is pretty meh, but depends on your skin tone, I'm a bit lighter than NC15. The darkest shade I use as bronzer (but you could get a cheaper, better bronzer) and the lightest shade I used to use all over my face as a finishing powder, but I prefer MAC skinfinish in lightscapade now. I can't use the middle shade. It makes my face look muddy."
AustralianMakeup,37tf3k,compactgirlfriend,1 point,Sat May 30 10:13:09 2015 UTC,"I'm a monte blanc/ nc 15 kinda girl, I to tall don't regret my purchase, but if you go into it expecting a contour palette you're gonna be disappointed. Incandescent is a nice highlight though. I use it on the too half and din light on the bottom of my face as a finishing powder, it makes skin look amazing, especially in photos omg. Radiant light I def use less but turns out it's actually killer to help blend out eyeshadow like a transition shade."
AustralianMakeup,37tf3k,kohl_,1 point,Sat May 30 10:49:10 2015 UTC,"Hallo! I'm Santa Fe in Nars and my best friend is around an NC10. We both bought it. I use every shade. The first colour as a setting powder, the second as a highlight and the third to blend out a contour or I use it as an everyday no makeup makeup contour. My best friend is pale but it suits her skin so nicely! The powders are very finely milled and are a dream to blend. I use mine everyday so I am justifying the purchase, and when I run out, I will repurchase.   Hope that helps :)"

AustralianMakeup,37prap,berlin_chair_,6,Fri May 29 13:00:01 2015 UTC,"YES i bought three eyeshadows and two liners as part of the modster collection.  They are super pigmented and i love them! The shadows have manuka honey in them but they feel creamy but not as creamy as a foiled eyeshadow (i'm comparing to Makeup Geek's foiled shadows). I have quite oily and hooded lids as i'm asian (but not your traditional hooded lids, i have like three little hoods - sounds bizzare but it's not!)  and i find that these shadows wear a lot better than the foiled shadows as they have less oil in their formula so they tend not to crease. I bought rose gold, gold and the purple shade.   For the eyeliners they are super creamy. I'd say they are really good, but i think i prefer the urban decay 24/7 liners as i think they last longer. I got the shades coffee (brown) and cream (sort of yellow-y cream). I LOVE the cream shade! I don't own anything like it but it complements the yellow undertone of my skin so nicely.   I think they are super pricey...i think the eyeliners are great but only buy it if it's a shade you don't already own. The LA Girl ones are not as creamy but still super pigmented and <$5. They have a pretty good colour range as well.  I also got a free sample of the black liner, but haven't used it yet!   I can do swatches later when i get home if you want? Let me know.   Hope this helps!! :)"
AustralianMakeup,37prap,sophietan,3,Sun May 31 01:22:03 2015 UTC,"I'm curious about them too. Looked up a few reviews on Makeup Alley and Sephora, and they seem pretty well reviewed. Will probably wait to see some reactions on here first before spending on an unknown brand though!"
AustralianMakeup,37prap,Artemisian11,2,Fri May 29 23:05:08 2015 UTC,"Their foundation sounds like a really cool concept but then I guess most of us already blend our foundation to get different coverage. That being said, I'd still totally check it out"
AustralianMakeup,37prap,insiped,2,Sat May 30 01:25:34 2015 UTC,"Doesn't really appeal to me. The brand aesthetic, packaging etc doesn't excite me, agree on the use of Punker- seems like a Rimmel or Australis type word. At the price point Of $37 for a lipstick (which is my personal weakness and accordingly benchmark) I'd  rather Lipstick Queen  or an extra tenner for NARS audacious."

AustralianMakeup,37prap,jamballdonut,1 point,Sat May 30 06:18:19 2015 UTC,"I first heard of Ardency Inn in a video by Samantha from Batalash (think it was this one). When I was in America last Summer I went to buy a few of their shadows from Sephora, but found out they are only sold online (which appears to be the same deal for Mecca).  I too haven't heard that much about this brand, but they definitely aren't new. I'm interested in trying their eyeshadows (especially Peacock, Copper and Rose Gold), but I'm not sure whether I'm willing to fork out 30 bucks for a single shadow. They ARE supposed to be comparable to MAC shadows, which are the same price."
AustralianMakeup,37prap,Pandarmonium,1 point,Sat May 30 09:30:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, unless they do a bigger incentive than 'free eyeliner' for this brand it's not that appealing"
AustralianMakeup,37kdfd,score1fortheprincess,5,Thu May 28 07:03:31 2015 UTC,"That sucks S1, usually you can just use a small piece of paper towel and scratch off the top layer if that happens - which should be crazy easy if it's a softer metallic shadow so it's odd that that hasn't worked. I use fix+ to foil my metallics etc unless they're matte shadows and haven't had any problems so far - would you mind posting a picture if you can? It might help somebody figure out what's going on! :("
AustralianMakeup,37kdfd,Jessijames,2,Thu May 28 07:48:50 2015 UTC,"I've had this happen to a few eyeshadows and honestly, I've had to scrape a fair layer off before its back to normal because some of the product has kinda ""soaked in"" a bit (it happens a lot to one of my brow cakes because it's a partially powdery, partially creamy formula, its weird).  Try and dig a little deeper on one of the corners and see if you can find some of the dry product hiding underneath still :)"
AustralianMakeup,37kdfd,Flippantry,1 point,Thu May 28 10:03:17 2015 UTC,"I've never heard of something like that happening, maybe something isn't reacting well together between fix+ and the shadow, but I'd say let it dry over night and try scraping off the top layer before using again. I honestly don't know what could be wrong though, or how to fix it sorry :("
AustralianMakeup,37kdfd,starward-,1 point,Thu May 28 09:02:01 2015 UTC,"For future, when foiling shadows I either a) spray after dipping my brush in, or b) only touch the very corner of my shadow with the damp brush. I did this to ny light bronze in my pro but eventually after a few uses/when it dries more it should be easier to pick the shadow up, you might need to dig into it a bit more than usual though."

AustralianMakeup,37jysd,assaulted_peanuts,8,Thu May 28 04:22:32 2015 UTC,"I use a cosmetic cotton swab - swisspers make ones with a pointy end and a flat, wider end and I use this flat end to scrape the last bits out - they are also useful for fixing mascara smudges, but not so great for ear cleaning! You can also buy a makeup spatchelor specifically for this purpose, but I prefer cotton buds."

AustralianMakeup,37jysd,toasty_feet,7,Thu May 28 05:25:39 2015 UTC,"I prop the bottles upsidown. If the opening is big enough, then it collects in the inside of the lid, and you can scoop it out from there.  Obviously, you'd need to take out the pump part. If you've lost the lid, then you could probably rest it in a sample pot or similar."
AustralianMakeup,37jysd,Crumpet92,2,Thu May 28 06:10:08 2015 UTC,I second this. I get a little bowl and I'll prob the opened bottle upside down in it.
AustralianMakeup,37jysd,Jessijames,2,Thu May 28 08:21:36 2015 UTC,That is clever! Definitely into a little pot would be the way for me. Thanks :)
AustralianMakeup,37jysd,Jessijames,6,Thu May 28 23:09:44 2015 UTC,"Might not be much of a quick fix sorry, but I got this Ben Nye metal spatula from a supply store for about $5-10 and use it to (patiently) scrape out as much as I can! I prefer to not use cotton swabs/tips as I feel like they 'soak up' product and I see it as a waste and often don't reach the bottom. This has helped me scrape more that I would have been able to if I had tipped it upside down or used a cotton bud! You might find something similar from an art store if you don't have anywhere nearby that stocks Ben Nye or other SFX items! :)"

AustralianMakeup,37jysd,SizzlingVivacity,2,Fri May 29 09:35:23 2015 UTC,Could you take the lid off and tip it into another container? You could get a sample container from somewhere or even Spotlight and just store the last of it in one of those?

AustralianMakeup,37fxwh,TheyreMineralsMarie1,10,Thu Jun 4 05:06:06 2015 UTC,"My long-term regret is ever shopping at Priceline. I wasted a ridiculous amount of money there on products that I couldn't try and things that just did not work for me. I was spending $400-$600 each quarter and giving away 80% of it! I bought >10 foundations from Priceline and I didn't like a single one of them, where as now I can go and get samples and just buy 1 that works perfectly.  Since I started shopping at Mecca and Myer I have not bought a single product that I've regretted. Sure there are ones I use less often but I still go back to them every now and again. My bank account hates me for it, but in a weird way I feel like I'm saving money because I'm not throwing things away anymore."

Everyone's different when it comes to stuff like this, I always tried to research but online swatches are never the same and some of the formulas I tried were atrocious.   Foundation was always the biggest problem for me, so I definitely tried my fair share of products, but being white as a ghost (too pale for almost every brand, still thinking of buying a white mixer because my HG Mac NW13 is a little dark in winter) and needing a formula that lasts minimum 14 hours isn't an easy combination to come by!"

AustralianMakeup,37fxwh,StrangeFarulf,2,Wed May 27 22:03:55 2015 UTC,"Have you tried blotting? I'm terrible at wearing lipstick but I find blotting, re-applying and blotting again helps! I personally haven't used the OCC Lip tars though so I can't comment if it'll work for them. :/"
AustralianMakeup,37fxwh,ComingUpMilhouse,2,Thu May 28 00:19:48 2015 UTC,I tried that. It was just so watery that it just didn't seem to set no matter what I tried.
AustralianMakeup,37fxwh,Lingamae,2,Thu May 28 00:23:49 2015 UTC,I have such a love hate relationship with lip tars. I put a drop on a surface and recently I decided it might help to let it dry a little and then I pick up the tiniest amount on my brush. It's totally not worth the effort though.
AustralianMakeup,37fxwh,jamballdonut,1 point,Sun May 31 01:08:54 2015 UTC,I bought some on a whim and they are too easy to smear all over. Plus I find it almost impossible to get even coverage.
AustralianMakeup,37fxwh,dancepantz,4,Thu Jun 4 05:07:54 2015 UTC,"Hahaha, where do I begin?! I buy so many things to review for my channel, and so often they turn out super shit.  Cheap eyeshadow palettes - LOL, Glampacked, K-Mart brand ""Eyes Lips Face Nails"" or whatever, Designer Brands, Beauty Essentials, Miller & Moore, Lauren Luke, Profusion, the list goes on!  Most foundations/BB creams/face products - Either far too dark, far too heavy or just gross.  (Maybelline, Garnier, Revlon, Covergirl, L'Oreal, Fifth Avenue, Palmer's, Rimmel, SO MANY)  I can't even think of any more, but I'm sure if I sat down in front of my collection I could list another 600 haha  Edit: BUT I AM LOOOOVING the Nivea (Not Garnier, my apologies) Men Post Shave Balm! I don't watch NikkieTutorials, but heard about it on Facebook and tried it yesterday as a primer and holy shit.  I have oily but dehydrated skin and my foundation has never applied so well or lasted so nicely! It's suuuuuper hydrating and just ugh LOVE.  So keen to work through some more primers so I can start using this more often, and probably just gonna start using it as a moisturiser since it makes my skin feel so lovely and is SO lightweight and ugh AMAZING."
AustralianMakeup,37fxwh,jamballdonut,3,Thu May 28 09:37:35 2015 UTC,Oooh I've only seen people talking about the Nivea post shave balm - does it have a strong smell at all? Interested in getting this!
AustralianMakeup,37fxwh,dancepantz,5,Thu May 28 13:09:02 2015 UTC,"It does to begin with! It has that kind of generic ""mens"" smell (I honestly can't think of how to describe it, but like.. musky and spicy?) but it fades suuuuper quick and you barely notice it! I'm actually so absolutely impressed with how good it is!"
AustralianMakeup,37fxwh,jamballdonut,1 point,Fri May 29 02:55:47 2015 UTC,Oh yeah I know what you mean by generic mens smell haha. Good to know! I just might have to try this out as I'm running out of my beloved mineral veil. Have you tried the Revlon Photoready Prime and Anti Shine compact? I had a quick look through your channel and didn't see it so just wondering :)
AustralianMakeup,37fxwh,dancepantz,2,Fri May 29 03:11:19 2015 UTC,"I haven't! I don't really use Revlon products, since they're too expensive for my broke life.  Is that the like.. solid balm one? I played around with it, but never picked it up"
AustralianMakeup,37fxwh,jamballdonut,1 point,Fri May 29 04:28:14 2015 UTC,"I got it yesterday at the chemist warehouse sale ($13.48 woo!!) and tried it out today as a touch up. I'm already in love!

Oh and bite beauty whipped cherry lip scrub. Awful smell, taste and it is absolutely useless. My finger could scrub my lips better than that overpriced garbage. I never should have strayed from my lush mint lip scrub."

AustralianMakeup,37fxwh,jknee88,3,Mon Jun 1 01:44:22 2015 UTC,"I don't like it as much as the Elf exfoliator stick. I found the Lush one rather crappy, I know it's just sugar crystals but I didn't think it actually did much for my lips. The ELF one is like a lipstick shaped bullet with a kind of chapstick-sugar consistency, way better and less messy. You just gently go over the parts of your lips with dead skin and boom, fresh softy lips. :)"
AustralianMakeup,37fxwh,ailee612,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:49:03 2015 UTC,thanks! i didn’t realize ELF had one too (and their price tag makes the purchse so much easier)
AustralianMakeup,37fxwh,deadlypony,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:52:16 2015 UTC,"Totally agree! The ELF one is a lot easier to use, and is a bit moisturising as well while the Lush one isn't."

Everyone talks about it so much, but when I saw it in Mecca it just looks like a massive glitterfest in a colour too light to matter on my skin. I got Liberte instead, best choice ever."
AustralianMakeup,37fxwh,Artemisian11,1 point,Fri May 29 12:59:35 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of Nars blushes are glitterfests and I don't like that at all. Sleek has a good shimmery not glittery dupe in rose gold and The Balm has Hot Mama, I have both and don't regret either. One is slightly more peach and one slightly more pink."
AustralianMakeup,37fxwh,Artemisian11,1 point,Sun May 31 01:14:07 2015 UTC,"There's a few Nars ones I really want, more matte colours that I think are gorgeous.

AustralianMakeup,37fxwh,milkyoranges,2,Sun May 31 01:44:10 2015 UTC,"Porefessional probably qualifies for me. I don't hate it, but it's so bloody expensive and now I have cheaper drugstore dupes that do basically the same thing. I bought a pack from Benefit with They're  Real, a mini Porefessional (already had bought the big one, just gave the mini away) and Gimme Brow in medium ... that Gimme Brow was the worst thing, has put me off trying it in the proper colour for me (dark).  There's not many others - Revlon lip stains, they look terrible on me. Some of the Velourlips colours - when I was first learning makeup and I bought them, and them discovered I look like the weirdest failed Kardashian-wannabe in most pinks :("
AustralianMakeup,37fxwh,whereismydragon,1 point,Wed May 27 23:24:58 2015 UTC,Hmm I was considering getting the Porefessional primer once I return the Porefessional Agent Zero but I probably won't even get that now that you mention it... I was very tempted to get the Gimme Brow as well but I figured I already had dipbrow so I don't need any more eyebrow products! :/  Yeah I've actually only started learning to play around with makeup this year and I find the Velourlips really hard to work with and can get really messy. And I know what you mean about pink lipsticks... I bought this Too Faced Melted in Peony and it didn't match my skintone at ALL. Love the colour though but I've barely touched it since I bought it. :/

AustralianMakeup,37fxwh,milkiebuttle,1 point,Fri May 29 10:10:16 2015 UTC,I think it depends on your skin tone.  I got that + Nars Super Orgasm for my mum (she's Chinese) and it is the perfect combination for Asian skin :) She's around an NC15.

While these are a nice consistency and texture, every single colour looks nice in the bottle and is then bright orange on my skin. I have never seen what their staying power is like, nor have I seen if they oxidize badly as they looked SO bad that I took them off again (all the ones I tried were lightest colour in the range).  To be fair to Avon, my go to foundation for YEARS was one of their compact cream foundations - I still love carrying those in my bag for emergencies."
AustralianMakeup,37fxwh,Tonkie,2,Fri May 29 09:20:36 2015 UTC,W7 lip paint. It actually feels like paint and smells so strong of mint. It's a horrible consistency too!

AustralianMakeup,37b1rm,jamballdonut,16,Tue May 26 08:43:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not really supposed to mention this but it has been published in financial papers and stuff. BUT, I work at the store and Target's not doing so great in regards to money. So they're trying to attract to you actually even spend in the store. Better to get some profit through sales than none at all at the usual price.   For example, You know those spend $60 get $10 off vouchers you get in the door? They're getting desperate for you to spend anything there  That and I was told by a manager that ""previously"" certain things were sold overmarked and then sales were them just at normal price.   You Didn't hear this from me"
AustralianMakeup,37b1rm,DelusionRoulette,25,Tue May 26 12:51:22 2015 UTC,"Oh, wow! That's crazy!  Honestly, though, I used to LOVE Target.  They sold decent clothing at a decent price, now it kind of feels like they're trying too hard to be an actual department store.  I mean, $89 for a dress? I go to Target to buy a $30 dress, not a $90 one! I feel like if they stopped selling such expensive clothing, they'd probably start making money again! Especially when you can get cheaper clothing at K-Mart/Big-W and actual name-brand stuff for a similar price from Myer/David Jones.  It does suck that they're not doing well though!"
AustralianMakeup,37b1rm,Jessijames,11,Tue May 26 12:57:04 2015 UTC,"I feel you on the clothing thang man! They used to be my go-to for neat office attire, happy to pay $30 for a nice blouse or $40 for some good pants something for work but not $50-$80+ - I may as well go to Portmans or something or Myer/DJ's like you said! I feel like they used to be a good medium between Kmart/Big W & Myer but now that they're gone a bit more up-market there's nothing in that middle ground except specialty stores.  I get a lot of my stuff from Big W now, a bit of it is still a lower quality but I find say the Emerson brand they carry is pretty well made for the price!!"
AustralianMakeup,37b1rm,sezionmakeup,4,Tue May 26 23:51:06 2015 UTC,"Yes! I definitely saw Target as an in-between, and now they're just waaaay too expensive.  The only stuff I buy from there are clearance clothing & makeup, because the clothing is just toooo far out of my budget.  Also helps that K-Mart has been releasing some reaaaaally nice stuff lately for decent pricing! (Will admit I rarely go into Big-W, but might take a squizz today to see what they have! Have always enjoyed the stuff I have gotten from there - Emerson, especially!)"
AustralianMakeup,37b1rm,Shiavo,3,Wed May 27 00:25:44 2015 UTC,"Same here! I used to get a lot of reasonably priced clothes at Target a few years ago, but now they're in Australia, I go to H&M for for cheap clothes. Sure, the quality isn't amazing, but for $150 or so, I can get 2/3 dresses and few different tops, they'll last 3 or so months and right when I start to get a bit bored with them, they start to wear out and I can go replace them with new things. Can't do that with Target anymore."
AustralianMakeup,37b1rm,pootlepower,2,Wed May 27 04:10:22 2015 UTC,Here here on the clothing!! Target was my go to - need some new nice cut work pants/jacket/simple by pretty dress at a good price.

AustralianMakeup,37azuf,amblingodyssey,1 point,Tue May 26 10:38:07 2015 UTC,"Oh wow I wonder if my pot has dried up or sth... every time I dip my brush into it, it starts forming all these clumps and its not smooth at all ):"
AustralianMakeup,37azuf,asteroyale,1 point,Tue May 26 10:44:39 2015 UTC,"What colour do you have? Some of them are a bit dodgy. Copperthorn, for example, is terrible and clumps up like you described."
AustralianMakeup,37azuf,compactgirlfriend,1 point,Wed May 27 08:34:29 2015 UTC,Blacktrack :S
AustralianMakeup,37azuf,amblingodyssey,2,Wed May 27 09:28:15 2015 UTC,"I had the same problem but I took some out of the pot and put it on the back of my hand to warm it up (maybe blow on it or use low heat on a hairdryer). It seems to glide on a lot more smoothly. Also, if you're worried about it drying up too often, you should try the Maybelline lasting gel drama eyeliner. It seems to be a pretty good dupe for mac's blacktrack but longer wearing :)"
AustralianMakeup,37azuf,asteroyale,1 point,Thu May 28 03:40:03 2015 UTC,"Oh weird. My Blacktrack is awesome - maybe you got a dud? Could you take it back or is it way too late? I actually prefer the cheapo Maybelline gel liner, if you are looking for a replacement."
AustralianMakeup,37azuf,amblingodyssey,1 point,Wed May 27 10:24:16 2015 UTC,Its way too late ): Would you happen to know any fixes?
AustralianMakeup,37azuf,jamballdonut,2,Wed May 27 11:28:47 2015 UTC,The only solutions I can think of are somehow wetting it more using something like setting spray or baby oil. I know when my dipbrow was drying out someone suggested baby oil and that worked amazingly but changed the texture so it didn't apply so thickly. Anyway either of those things might actually mess it up more so not sure really. Sorry.

AustralianMakeup,37awno,Shiavo,1 point,Tue May 26 14:05:28 2015 UTC,I swatched the lighter palette and it came off very reddish :( Not sure how it looks on the cheek. It kind of reminds me of MAC Harmony. I really like the idea of it though. Maybe the darker one will be better.

Mecca is committed to bringing you our exclusive brands at prices that are as close to the international market as possible. Fluctuations in the Australian dollar mean our prices will change from time to time. The pricing of our brands is reviewed every 6 to 9 months, however any movement will remain in line with our Price Promise of US RRP Prices (converted to AUD) + 10% GST + Shipping. To help explain why the prices have increased, since the time of our last pricing review (August 2014), the AUD$ has fallen 16% against the USD and so we are now pricing at $0.78 in accordance with our pricing promise. For more information on Mecca pricing, please visit http://mecca.com.au/price-promise.html and if you have any further questions or would like to speak to one of our customer service representatives, please email us directly on customerservice@mecca.com.au or call 1800 007 844.

AustralianMakeup,376xfo,dancepantz,2,Mon May 25 23:05:03 2015 UTC,Came here to ask the same thing! So annoyed! We're already being gouged enough as it is :(
AustralianMakeup,376xfo,jamballdonut,1 point,Tue May 26 08:56:37 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, they did make an announcement? (I could possibly be confused though, I can't remember whether the girl who posted in a FB group I'm in said she emailed them or they made an official announcement.)  Anyway, they said it's because of currency fluctuation, and the most they can raise the price os 30%, so the prices they have now is the absolute highest it can ever go (Apparently).  My theory is that the lowered the prices when Sephora was due to open because they were genuinely scared (But, again blamed it on currency fluctuation) and now that they realise Sephora isn't actually a threat, they've raised 'em back up.  ETA: It's also Mecca-exclusive brands only that have had the price rise."
AustralianMakeup,376xfo,jamballdonut,1 point,Tue May 26 04:06:32 2015 UTC,"I follow Mecca on facebook and instagram, plus get the newsletter emails and never heard anything!  Also, I agree with why they dropped + raised the prices. If they dropped the prices randomly and not because of Sephora, that would have been stupid, because the AUD has been sitting around the 70c mark for a year now, and they dropped their prices in December last year I believe? But yeah, with Sephora opening up and not keeping to their word of price matching the US, they haven't been massive competition.  It's a shame, I hope the AUD comes up soon, I would prefer to buy from Mecca than some overseas company and support Australian businesses."

I'm assuming they did send this girl an email then (I think it was just a general email she sent them, not like a newsletter or anything)  Yeah, & I think they also feel quite confident since they have exclusive Australian rights to UD and Ardency Inn now, so they don't see Sephora as any sort of competition.  Sucks because my birthday is in 2 weeks, and I was gonna spend some money on my first Nars products, but now I'm just gonna go to Illamasqua and MAC!"

AustralianMakeup,376z0k,chocolatespeckle,1 point,Mon May 25 11:57:43 2015 UTC,I definitely think I'll be purchasing these!
AustralianMakeup,376z0k,breviloquent-,5,Tue May 26 02:39:57 2015 UTC,"Zoeva for eye and face, Real Techniques for face ( I use the eye set for face as well), Jessup for face and some ELF Studio ones are actually extremely good. I would say stay away from Sigma as Zoeva is better quality and cheaper.  EDIT : BEAUTYBLENDER IS LIFE"
AustralianMakeup,376z0k,Jessijames,3,Mon May 25 12:28:45 2015 UTC,"Zoeva, hands down."
AustralianMakeup,376z0k,turtleonitsback1,3,Mon May 25 23:41:07 2015 UTC,"Everyone seems to love Zoeva brushes, any recommendations on where to buy them??"
AustralianMakeup,376z0k,Jessijames,3,Tue May 26 02:33:44 2015 UTC,"If you can, buy them from Luxola. They have free shipping to Aus if you spend over $40 AUD and my orders from them always arrive in a week or less.   Their pricing is around the same as Beauty Bay, BB might even be slightly cheaper BUT you'll be waiting 3-4 weeks minimum and I don't know how many times I have heard people not getting the right stuff or having items missing when ordering from Beauty Bay. I've even had an order not turn up all together from them! On the other hand I've had plenty of other orders from them that arrived just fine, albeit 4-8 weeks after ordering."
AustralianMakeup,376z0k,turtleonitsback1,2,Tue May 26 03:22:50 2015 UTC,Thank you!! Good to know- I'm a bit impatient when it comes to ordering things online (I get too excited hehe) so glad Luxola is relatively fast!

AustralianMakeup,376z0k,Pandarmonium,3,Tue May 26 07:10:56 2015 UTC,"TLDR; My top pick is Real Techniques, but I also recommend the e.l.f Studio Collection and looking at a few choice picks from MAC (especially the 217 and 266).  In my collection of brushes (both face and eyes) I have e.lf, Real Techniques and MAC - which I would consider low, mid and high end brushes respectively.   The e.l.f brushes are cheap as chips, at only a few bucks per brush, but unfortunately they are also cheap in quality - especially the e.l.f 'Essential Professional' collection  (the ones with white handles) which I've had a couple break at the ferrule. I wouldn't recommend el.f for professional work as their brushes tend to be poorly made and not suitable for travel. Their 'Studio' brush collection do fare better however and are better made. There are actually a couple brushes that I personally use daily (such as the Studio C, Eye Contour and Kabuki Face brush). I'd try out a couple of the Studio eye brushes in your kit, since these are the brushes you tend to want multiples of, and see how they go. The Real Techniques brushes are probably my favourite at the moment, and the ones I recommend the most. The brand has a good range of face and eye brushes for all different uses. Of the dozen or so I have (all original collection), I've found the brushes are durable and easy to clean, and I've never experienced any shedding issues. I particularly love the Buffing Brush for full coverage foundation looks and the RT Sponge, which I think is super comparable to the Original Beauty Blender, but at like a quarter of the cost. If you do decide to try Real Techniques, definitely take a look at www.iherb.com - you can get a lot of the RT brushes there for half the price they are in Priceline. I find MAC brushes to be high quality in pretty much all the aspects you look for in a makeup brush; and, with the proper care, they can last many years (which is a big pro for professional work). However, you're gonna be forking out a small fortune if you wanna ""catch 'em all"". I do think MAC is a popular choice for professional MUA's not just because of the brush quality, but also because of the ""prestige"", if that makes sense? Like someone who only buys Gucci handbags or Christian Louboutin shoes - the products are quality, but the price tag can be pretty ridiculous. A few choice picks from MAC may be good for your kit, such as brushes that you will get a lot of use and are more 'important' (like a foundation brush). On a personal note, my holy grail brush (from any brand I've tried, and for any use) is the 217 Blending Brush. It blends eyeshadow like a dream, especially in the crease. I've also never found a sharper of more precise angled brush than the 266 Small Angle Brush."
AustralianMakeup,376z0k,Artemisian11,1 point,Tue May 26 13:32:10 2015 UTC,"Wow this was so help full thank you so much for this, I have heard so many reviews about the 217 from Mac and I really need to get my hands on it! But it's good to see how common real techniques are seeing as there not expensive  However Mac is just so pricey especially for brush sets.  Have you ever heard of the brush brand Gorgeous brushes? I've heard they are also really good too"
AustralianMakeup,376z0k,LMTartistry,2,Tue May 26 14:18:15 2015 UTC,"I've only used Real Techniques, Sigma and a few ELF ones myself, but my friend who's just re-building her freelance kit went with a big Zoeva kit, so consider that a third recommendation for them!"
AustralianMakeup,376z0k,nixedreamer,2,Mon May 25 14:08:08 2015 UTC,"I have a lot of different brushes because I keep changing it up.

AustralianMakeup,372uvx,ailee612,3,Sun May 24 15:56:36 2015 UTC,"I guess its just that it's a really nice and decently pigmented blush for only $2.80!  It looks like this (square blush in the middle) so it's a really cute little quad so you can somewhat change how it looks if you wanted to blend all the colours together, or even just use the top left or top 2 as a highlight.  There's a couple of shades too, its pretty awesome.  I'd say quality is on par with my Bourjois Blushes and much easier to use due to the wide flat pan."
AustralianMakeup,372uvx,Flippantry,2,Mon May 25 01:50:15 2015 UTC,"Oooh I picked up this blush and the blush/highlighter duo at Daiso. Gotta say, amazingly impressed for $2.80!!  The single one in your photo is better than the duo one in my opinion, but it's still nice! :)"

It has such a nice formula and is the favourite red out of the ones I own. Eyeshadow: Probably the Australis bronze eyed girl palette, I tend to use this a lot more than my other eye shadow products. Good pigment and staying power for such a cheap price. - Eyeliner: Maybelline unstoppable in 'mocha'. This stuff stays on until you want it to come off and its such a nice colour! -Blush: I only have some blush included in an NP Set palette, O much prefer the brown over the pink, pink blush makes me look doll like. -Mascara: Maybelline Stiletto. I love this mascara. It rarely clumps and makes my lashes super long! -Face Powder: Maybelline Matte Maker in 'Natural Beige"". Suits my skin tone perfectly."

AustralianMakeup,36yt3u,gospursgo_,6,Sat May 23 07:05:26 2015 UTC,"Honest review... I ordered a lipstick from there using the coupon code 'thankyou' which gives 50% off and free international shipping (awesome deal right!).   The lipstick arrived covered in lumps, had a black/brown particle imbedded into the bullet and near the bottom there was also a swirl of what looked like unblended pigment. I emailed them with pics and to their credit they replied very quickly after that but I was surprised that they apologised for my lipstick arriving ""sweaty"" without any further concern. I can assure you those lumps were not sweat. They said they have reshipped me a new one and would reply with a tracking number that I could use at the fedex site.... That was a week ago. Still no tracking number.  I'm gonna put a proper review up on my blog once the replacement gets here and wasn't planning on discussing it until then but I feel compelled to warn my fellow Aussie!! I'm also waivering on whether I will actually even use the replacement as to me it seems there is an issue with quality control, and their response to this left a lot to be desired IMO. I have no idea what is in that lipstick or why it looks like that, but I feel like they should have been more concerned about identifying what the issue was to make sure it wouldn't happen again to anyone else rather than to play it off as sweat. I should mention I had sent them I think 3-4 photos detailing this, all taken with my DSLR to show off the detail better, so it's not like a case of they didn't realise what they were looking at cause of my potato photos.   So all in all, I would say be wary of purchasing, and maybe don't grab alot all at once just in case you don't love the formula as I have seen other reviews remarking on the chalkiness of the lipsticks too (though I can't be bothered googling them right now!)."
AustralianMakeup,36yt3u,starward-,1 point,Sat May 23 07:20:08 2015 UTC,"oh wow, that sounds so dodgy, wtf. yeah, ive seen the chalkiness also mentioned. hope your replacement arrives soon!"
AustralianMakeup,36yt3u,starward-,1 point,Sat May 23 16:39:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks, good luck with your purchase!!"
AustralianMakeup,36yt3u,ailee612,4,Sat May 23 16:45:51 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely not a ""beauty guru"" by any means but I do have a slightly ridiculous lipstick obsession so I feel relatively qualified to comment...  There have actually been a couple of questions and reviews about Gerard on /r/makeupaddiction as well, if you're looking for more honest opinions!  I own 2 lipsticks; Tequila Sunrise and 1995. I would never pay full price for them because I feel like I can find similar quality at the drugstore. Also, because there's a tonne of very good coupon codes out there so it would be kind of silly to do so (like the thankyou code another commenter wrote).  Both of the lipsticks I have (1995 and Tequila Sunrise) are matte, and I think 1995 is a really unique, beautiful colour. I will say that both of them, while not drying, are not kind to lips that haven't been prepped beforehand (they'll catch onto dry patches and things like that). I've read other reviews on them, and the general consensus (and my own opinion) is that the lighter colours e.g. Tequila Sunrise apply less nicely than the darker ones e.g. 1995. One thing I will say is that if you're somebody who's picky with the smell of lipsticks, I would pass on these. It's not a very obvious smell, and I can't smell it while I'm putting the lipsticks on, but if you hold them up to your nose (am I the only weird person that does that?) they smell kind of cheap and play-doh-ish.  Another thing is the packaging feels more light than you'd expect, which makes it feel cheaper.   I reckon your best bet is, like starward said, to pick up one or two just in case you hate the formula and to stick to the darker colours."
AustralianMakeup,36yt3u,sophietan,1 point,Sat May 23 08:11:13 2015 UTC,"bugger, i was more interested in the lighter nudes but the consensus seems to be: chalk city :/ thanks so much for that though!"
AustralianMakeup,36yt3u,sarkata,2,Sat May 23 16:41:35 2015 UTC,"I really like them. Some of my lipsticks were 'sweaty' and the packaging is lighter and a bit cheaper than it looks.   Lipsticks: I love buttercup and berry smoothie. I feel like all their lipsticks are a different formula. I also have nude, 1995, all dolled up, fire engine, underground and tequila sunrise.   Lip glosses: best Gerard products imo. These are pigmented and just great. I have a tonne of the shades and don't have any issues. The LED light in them is a cute idea but I think it's unnecessary to be honest. They have a really diverse colour range. I'm not usually a gloss girl, but these are the only ones I use.   Bb cream: smells a little weird... Kinda sunscreen-ish. I love the finish under foundation though. Do no recommend if you're oily as it legit makes you look like dewy af. I just put it on my cheekbones under my foundation for extreme highlight.   They have amazing discount codes and free shipping with most of them. I probs wouldn't buy their products full price, but it's worth it with a discount & free shipping. I'd probs look for a code that's at least 35% off. There's heaps floating around.   Also I just bought the star powders (highlighters), I can do a swatch/mini review of those for you too if you'd like. Although they won't arrive for a while.   (sorry for bad formatting - I'm on my phone!)"

AustralianMakeup,36yt3u,burnt_can,2,Sat May 23 16:40:38 2015 UTC,The recent ~dramas~ surrounding the owner of Gerard and the general responses to unsavoury reviews (basically: they don't like them) - which I think is something that any brand owner needs to...be okay with... have turned me well and truly off the brand
AustralianMakeup,36yt3u,batdee,2,Sun May 24 11:42:41 2015 UTC,"i came across the drama today and it kind of put me off. its so so so unprofessional and gross; at times i get torn between thinking 'i dont care about business and the drama if i like a product' vs 'why should i support these dodgy people' a la limecrime etc. but with so many great alternatives flooding the market, im finding myself turned off so quickly when incidents like these occur (esp with the suggestion that its all cheap make up with little quality control and just a name slapped on). i enjoy how a start up like colourpop has been pretty drama free afaik without any owners in the spotlight like Morphe or the gerard lady"
AustralianMakeup,36vvps,Shiavo,20,Fri May 22 15:15:19 2015 UTC,"From what I understand  Contour powder is used to darken the shadows of your face. It is usually more grey toned compared to bronzer.   Bronzer is used to warm up the complexion and is more brown/ yellow/ gold. It can also be used lightly all over the face whereas contour powder is generally limited to areas you want to add more shadow to.   Finishing powder is used to create a glowy or dewy effect and while it does set makeup it's not its entire purpose. Finishing powder is sometimes used over setting powder as it doesn't set as well.   Setting powder is, as the name suggests, used to set (usually liquid) foundation so that it can last longer.   Pressed powder is used to mattify the face to achieve a matte finish. It also sets foundation but it aims to get rid of that oily shine.   Edit: typo"
AustralianMakeup,36vvps,asteroyale,14,Fri May 22 15:26:30 2015 UTC,"Pressed powder isn't necessarily mattifying - it just means instead of the powder being loose, it's been pressed into a compact. You can get both finishing and setting powders in pressed form as well as powder foundations :)"
AustralianMakeup,36vvps,Arlibie,2,Fri May 22 21:17:25 2015 UTC,Oh! So is pressed powder just a compact form of lose setting powder? Is there a pro / con to use one over the other?
AustralianMakeup,36vvps,dancepantz,3,Sat May 23 15:18:37 2015 UTC,The only pro/con of loose vs pressed (for me) is that loose powder always gets everywhere no matter how careful I am with it. I prefer pressed powder waaay more for the portability and mess-free-ness of it.
AustralianMakeup,36vvps,fuzzboo,2,Mon May 25 08:48:00 2015 UTC,"Yep, this covers it pretty well. A contour would be used where you'd want to create the illusion of a shadow (hollows of cheeks, eye crease, under the jawline), whereas a bronzer is generally used on the higher planes of your face where sun would hit (temples, edge of face)."
AustralianMakeup,36vvps,asteroyale,1 point,Sat May 23 06:33:19 2015 UTC,Thank you very muchly! This certainly explains a few things about why I can't seem to get my bronzers to look like a subtle shadow! Hahaha. A lot of bronzers unfortunately have a kind of muddy look on my greenish skin due to the red in them :(   I thought maybe I just couldn't do the shadowing! Apparently I need to look for a contour!
AustralianMakeup,36vvps,gizzlemahizzle,3,Fri May 22 15:36:49 2015 UTC,"Back when I used a really warm bronzer for contouring I had sooo many issues. It would be way too orange and the one I got also had shimmer in it. That should've been a hint that it wasn't for contouring haha. My tip for making sure it doesn't look too muddy is to use a light hand and gently build it up as opposed to ""rubbing"" it in with a brush from the very beginning."
AustralianMakeup,36vvps,asteroyale,1 point,Fri May 22 15:46:38 2015 UTC,"Thankyou so very much! That really helps a lot. I have most certainly been ending up muddy, orange and shimmery! Haha.

AustralianMakeup,36vjj2,neccessarygirl,3,Fri May 22 13:35:41 2015 UTC,"The thing thats made the most difference to the longevity of my makeup is urban decay all nighter, I use it sparingly though because my skin is so dry. The nyx matte one does a fair job too. I know powder under foundation can make it last longer as well, you could give that a go. In terms of foundation, Revlon colourstay and Maybelline superstay, as well as L'Oreal true match have all worked quite well for me. Hope this helps!"
AustralianMakeup,36vjj2,freezethefire,2,Fri May 22 14:28:30 2015 UTC,"Not sure if my skin type is totally relevant - but the products I like might react totally differently to me than say to someone with dry skin. I have acne prone combination skin with an oily T-zone. The Rimmel Stay Matte Primer also broke me out.  If I want my foundation to last a long time (and this is a routine I recently did for my graduation day so it lasted from 7am to about 4pm fairly well).   Primer: L'Oreal Paris Base Magique Foundation: Any silicone based one to go with the primer Finishing Powder: Rimmel Stay Matte Pressed Powder   This combination seems to keep my foundation on pretty securely, AND doesn't break me out."

The one that really drives me up the wall is using Milk of Manganese as a primer. I may not know a lot about makeup, but my background in biochemistry tells me enough to know that the reason the makeup is adhering to your face ""so nicely"" is because this product LITERALLY STRIPS OFF YOUR ACID MANTEL. Like stripping the lacquer off a wooden table. Great to paint, but the wood is now bare and exposed and easily damaged...and that is like stuffing foundation onto a skinned knee, which is good for no one.

AustralianMakeup,36uq5w,pootlepower,1 point,Fri May 22 09:11:25 2015 UTC,I've just had a look and the post says that if Dimethicone is listed near the top then it's silicone based. May I ask why you think it's water based?
AustralianMakeup,36uq5w,pootlepower,3,Fri May 22 18:56:09 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the late reply: while it's near the top, it's the 6th ingredient and is the only 'cone'. Most water-based primers will have one or maybe two cones, but lower down in the product list as the 6th, 7th, or 8th ingredient. If you look at the ingredients of silicone based primer there will be several types of silicones and they will be much higher in the list, like 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc."
AustralianMakeup,36uq5w,starward-,2,Sat May 23 11:54:04 2015 UTC,"That was super helpful, thanks so much for the response!"
AustralianMakeup,36uq5w,originalaliswan,2,Sat May 23 14:00:00 2015 UTC,"I got the ingredients off the priceline website:  Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Isopropyl Palmitate, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Stearic Acid, Dimethicone, Glyceryl Stearate,Triethanolamine, Tocopheryl Acetate, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Fragrance(Parfum), Imidazolidinyl Urea, Carbomer, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Tetrasodium EDTA.  AFAIK, ingredients listings go in quanity so the ingredient that's in the highest amount goes first. Since water is listed here, I would assume it's water based?"
AustralianMakeup,36uq5w,starward-,2,Fri May 22 07:44:43 2015 UTC,"IIRC the more ""-xanes"" and ""cones"" there are at the top of the list, it is more silicone based.   By this reasoning, I think you are correct as dimethicone is the only up there."
AustralianMakeup,36uq5w,astateoffeels,2,Fri May 22 08:21:58 2015 UTC,"Water being the first ingredient does not mean it is water based.

AustralianMakeup,36tfcd,Jessijames,4,Thu May 21 23:46:31 2015 UTC,"Hey JJ, I have both and prefer the Mecca. The only ""down side"" is it is I a pot, so you have to dip your finger in.  The smell, flavour and texture are all  delightful for me, and good price point. The reason I don't like the bite as much is it is stupidly difficult to squeeze out of the tube. The product goes hard and you have to warm it up to get it going and I have been prone to sticking the end of a bobby pin in the opening to get it moving. On the lips it's nice and sinks in but I still prefer the Mecca.  I also have: by terry baume de rose , like but not for price point  Dior creme de rose probably my favourite closely followed by Mecca which I have the Christmas sample size so the owning is a bit smaller than the regular so I tend to get it under my nail  Smiths rosebud salve- no comparison. Stupid tin is a pain in the potatoes to open. Don't like this. I use it as a barrier cream to stop my hair dye from staining my skin :s  I can put a bit of each in a pot for ya if you want, or just the bite, I'm sure Mecca will give you a sample :) Hope that helps!"
AustralianMakeup,36tfcd,Tonkie,1 point,Fri May 22 01:54:27 2015 UTC,Ahhh Tonkie - perfection!! Thank you!   I have been leaning towards the Mecca purely for the price point and accessibility. It's something I use at home in the morning and at night when getting ready/unready so it being in a pot doesn't worry me as I can just use a little spatula to scoop it out.  The irks with the BITE that you describe is a big part of why I hate the Lanolin Lips so that's another point to the Mecca. I think I will just go ahead and purchase it when I next go into a Mecca anyway :) Thank you!!

AustralianMakeup,36trhu,violetbang,8,Fri May 22 01:31:17 2015 UTC,"I have been thinking about ordering from Colour Pop myself in a few weeks time. I've organised a lot of group buys on this sub, if there is enough interest as you say I can look into possibly taking over. I know that their shipping is not a set amount so it would be variable and I would need to change the usual guidelines but if people are down let me know and I'll look into it if I get approximate numbers. Something to the tune of:   Interested parties send me their orders > I collate the orders and work out what the shipping total should be > Send out everyone's total cost and request payment > Place the order > Receive the order and ship them out to you.  I think also because of the size & value of the items I myself would prefer to ship out from me to you via parcel post so that would be at least $8 or so plus whatever your portion of shipping from CP would be - unless you only purchased say 1-2 lippie stix or something and were comfortable them only being shipped via large letter.  TL;DR - If you're genuinely interested, let me know and I'll see what I can do. :)  EDIT: 1+ Myself interested so far."
AustralianMakeup,36trhu,Jessijames,1 point,Fri May 22 02:03:59 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to add if you're sending out the items in a usual bubble padded envelope, it would have to be sent as a package rather than a large letter for the eyeshadows or blushes - the boxes they are packaged in would make the width bigger than 2cm in the padded envelope. So, like you said, if it's just lippie stix's, it may fit as a large letter because they have a smaller width (including the box).   And for anyone wondering approximate cost of shipping, minimum cost is about $16 total, then jumping to $25 USD but stays there for quite a few products (I did a group buy with some girls from work, ordered 19 products with $25 shipping for your estimates before placing any orders but obv you can get a shipping estimate before placing an order).  Hope this information was helpful (and relevant) and not too rambly.  ETA: I'll ask my work friend if she is interested in joining again and if she is, I'll join as well (because I only want two items but I think she wants a few more)."

I hope it's like last year - I tended to stay away from the wicked busy stalls (Mac, Inglot, Sugarpill, a lot of the brush stores...Lime Crime...) and instead stuck to smaller retailers, and so didn't have to wait in many lines at all. It's definitely a lot busier in the morning than the afternoon, but things do start selling out if they're super popular. I'd also recommend going across to the EQ to get food in the middle of the day - better, and cheaper, than getting the food-stall stuff inside."

AustralianMakeup,36p69t,sarkata,4,Thu May 21 06:27:54 2015 UTC,"My first time was last year. I don't think I'll be returning this year, or in future years, because I'm not a MUA who needs to stock up and I am not a hoarder of makeup either, so I don't think the money I've ""saved"" from the discounts covered the admission fee. I went primarily for Hakuhodo brushes.   Tips:   Have a list ready of the items you're after, especially if you're headed to busy stalls like MAC. Before you join in the crowd, look where they put the products you're after and develop a strategy plan. If you see an SA rummaging through the cupboards for items, that's priority and head there first. When I went, I was only after lipsticks and got my items within 5-10 minutes. As for the queue -- I can't help that. You just have to stand and wait. Observe the crowds. When you see hundreds of people crowded around, have a look at other stalls. When the crowds dwindle, go! Bring cash.  Wet wipes are good if you intend on swatching a lot of products on your arm. Go in the afternoon? It depends on whether you're after very popular products or not."

As much as I'd love to go for the experience, I can't justify just how EXPENSIVE it would be from Adelaide.

AustralianMakeup,36p69t,jamballdonut,2,Thu May 21 09:03:01 2015 UTC,Dumb question but this is in Sydney right?
AustralianMakeup,36p69t,starward-,3,Thu May 21 04:04:16 2015 UTC,Yes! The website is here if you want to have a look. :)
AustralianMakeup,36p69t,chocolatespeckle,2,Thu May 21 04:31:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the link, I was being super lazy ;)"
AustralianMakeup,36p69t,starward-,2,Thu May 21 04:58:52 2015 UTC,I want to go. But the thought of all those people and the lines... I'm unsure. Is makeup significantly cheaper? Last I checked there wasn't even a seller list for imats.
AustralianMakeup,36p69t,score1fortheprincess,2,Thu May 21 04:48:59 2015 UTC,"The exhibitor list is here! I believe discounts range from around 20-40%. I know a lot of people have said they didn't find the experience very worth it, because it's a fair bit of money for a ticket and you have to try and ""make"" it all back with savings on purchases. It really depends... tickets are $40 until September 15 though (they go up to $50 after that), so you have a while to think about it."
AustralianMakeup,36p69t,chocolatespeckle,2,Thu May 21 04:59:44 2015 UTC,Good thread! I'm heading over from Perth so I'll be taking a massive list too. I'm looking forward to stocking up and maybe getting onto a face and body painting kit and a back up airbrush and compressor

Haven't decided which day yet, but I really want to get some Hakuhodo brushes and I think it'll just be a fun experience. What are you most looking forward to? :)  I haven't been before, but two tips I've read from other people's IMATS experiences are to bring plenty of cash as not all stalls will have eftpos and/or the eftpos line will be long, and to prepare lists of what you want to get from each stall. The second point is important because if there's a massive crowd you can just hand your list to one of the staff and they will be able to help you grab everything that you want."

AustralianMakeup,36p69t,Brikitty,1 point,Thu May 21 09:36:08 2015 UTC,"Nope, you can usually buy tickets on the day too (they're just a bit more expensive). Don't worry about it selling out."

I don't cleanse with it but after washing my face I put a bit on my fingers & apply it around my eye then use a damp makeup remover pad to wipe it off. I tend to do it before bed so I just leave the slight residue on & by the morning it's been absorbed :)
AustralianMakeup,36p1vz,seenoright,1 point,Thu May 21 05:40:38 2015 UTC,Not all coconut oil will work very well- there are certain brands that can sting. I'm pretty sure that Melrose is okay though.

AustralianMakeup,36p1vz,DarkHatexx,6,Thu May 21 08:10:20 2015 UTC,Garnier have this 2 in 1 clean sensitive gentle makeup remover. It's one of those duo-liquids that you shake up and is only about $9 for 200ml so is WAY cheaper than normal eye makeup remover  http://www.chemistwarehouse.com.au/product.asp?id=52989   It says it's for face and eyes but I only use it on my eyes (I think it's their attempt to make a version of their micellar water for sensitive skin). Never had an issue wi it and if it doesn't work just use it on your face
AustralianMakeup,36p1vz,compactgirlfriend,2,Thu May 21 00:41:37 2015 UTC,"This is my HG. I've tried alternative removers, but nothing has been as effective or gentle as this."

I skip the make-up remover/chemicals and use the Enjo daily face pads. I've saved a lot of money on make-up removers, and I can take it off before bed with no irritation!

AustralianMakeup,36p1vz,NikohlRose,2,Thu May 21 01:55:41 2015 UTC,"I use Lush's Ultrabland to remove my makeup with warm water. It's an oil based cleanser that also has the benefit of removing completely stubborn and waterproof makeup. I've never had a reaction to it (it's really gentle) and it protects my eye area skin and eyelashes really well.  I then follow up with the gentle dermasukin wash, as it can leave the skin feeling quite greasy."

I was very surprised when I discovered that Kit was part of the same brand.  Thank you in particular for the list of brands. I've spent ages trying to figure out what is sold where.  As someone who has just moved to Adelaide from NSW, I was really disappointed to discover that we only have Cosmetica's here. Urban Decay was released about a month before I moved and I had (and still have) no money to go in and have some fun. Same story with Sephora, haven't been inside yet and now I'm very far away."

When they told me it was carried at Kit, that was when I learned they were part of the same brand. The Kit Cosmetics store I went to was a stand-alone shop in Perth, and if we have one here, I'm guessing it's probably not the only one in the country lol :)"

AustralianMakeup,36pdna,Shiavo,2,Thu May 21 14:37:17 2015 UTC,"So I use it damp. So I pretty much run it under the basin and squeeze as much water out. So it already gets moist??  But to clean,  either use baby shampoo, liquid hand soap or what I use now the Daiso Sponge and Puff Cleaner.   So I first soak it with water and use one of the products and rub it into the sponge. Then rinse until there is no more soap. I might repeat this as well, if you can still see makeup on it.   You do have to let it air dr. The only way I think it will get moldy is if you stuff it into a makeup bag after using/cleaning it. If you let it sit out I think it should be fine.   Hope that helps out. :)"

Not sure I'd say it's my favorite product ever though but it's the only redeemable one I can think of :P
AustralianMakeup,36l9cq,ramikin_,2,Fri May 22 02:08:10 2015 UTC,"They are really hit and miss, it's true. I pretty much live by their Fresh and Flawless pressed powder. Sets foundation perfectly but I often use it alone, it gives similar coverage to a BB cream. Pretty shit shade range though. Others really like their Ready Set Go translucent powder, but it wasn't a favourite of mine. Their Velorlips matte lipsticks get raved about, but make sure to search them up in here before buying as some colours are duds. They have released a contour kit called AC ON TOUR that is apparently a dupe for the Anastasia Beverly Hills kit, from what I've read you need to have a light hand but it performs well. It's in my order so still waiting for it! I quite like the Stayput eyeliner and have heard good things about the 10 hour gel pencils. They also do the only low-end tubing mascara I've heard of, Multi Mega Lash. haven't tried it but am very curious. Hope this helped!"
AustralianMakeup,36l9cq,Shiavo,1 point,Fri May 22 02:26:27 2015 UTC,"I was actually really interested in that AC ON TOUR Contour Kit as well, but I went and tested it in Priceline and found that when I tried to blend the colour out on the back of my hand it seemed to disappear. I would love to hear what you think of it when you get it, because one of those colours is EXACTLY the colour contour I've been looking for!"
AustralianMakeup,36l9cq,Shiavo,1 point,Fri May 22 08:09:38 2015 UTC,"There's quite a few youtube videos demonstrating it's use if you want to see it in action. I've never contoured before so am probably not the best to give an opinion either way, haha. I'm pretty relieved to hear that it fades actually, most of what I've heard is that you need to go in with a super light hand and can be a bit muddy if you aren't careful. But a few people have said the banana shade is worth the price alone for setting under eye concealer even if you don't like the rest. There's a pretty good demonstration of each colour here, although because of that her final look is pretty dramatic."
AustralianMakeup,36l9cq,ComingUpMilhouse,2,Fri May 22 08:27:50 2015 UTC,"Oh! Thankyou very much!! Giving that a watch right now!

AustralianMakeup,36g752,EelSkinBeatrice,17,Tue May 19 03:28:12 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, if you're happy to see the money spent as an investment the Naked palettes are a great all-rounder especially if you're not much of an 'eye' girl it could easily cover all your bases. They're versatile enough that you can do daytime to nighttime to smokey, the quality of the shadows themselves are fantastic and if looked after the palette will last you a long time. The only thing missing would be some more neutral mattes (if neutral is your thing, which if you're a bold/lip type of person you likely are). For me, I would supplement it with one of the Naked Basics palettes down the track if you wanted the matte side of things as they would compliment each other fantastically but again that wouldn't be nessecary.  If you're on the fence about the colours, I would suggest picking up one of the Chi Chi nudes palettes, it's a straight up dupe for the Naked 1 so you can try it out, get used to the shades and how they work for you and upgrade if you feel the need. I started out with the Chi Chi and eventually splurged on the Naked 1 out of curiosity and pretty much threw my Chi Chi palette out within days because even though the Chi Chi are still decent shadows, the quality of the real Naked just smashed it out of the park for me."
AustralianMakeup,36g752,Jessijames,3,Tue May 19 03:35:06 2015 UTC,Thank you! I will definitely try the chi chi palletes first. they have so many different ones on the website I just wanna buy buy buy! I do prefer natural/nude looks with a bold lip. I love the smoky look and something  more for night time. But all the colours I have bought in the past have been really sheer and cruddy. Which puts me of trying again. That and I look lile I was punched in the eyes.
AustralianMakeup,36g752,BlissAbyss,2,Tue May 19 04:10:40 2015 UTC,"You could also try the MUA palettes on CrushCosmetics. The Undressed and the Undressed Me Too are meant to be dupes of the Naked 1 and 2. I have and like both (the MUA ones that is, I wanted to make sure I liked the colour types before investing in Urban Decay). Also they are only 10 AUD each. Although shipping can be around $10 unless you spend over $85 on the site. The site also has Wet n Wild and Sleek for other palette options. I would also suggest getting a matte palette to compliment any shimmery palette."
AustralianMakeup,36g752,WarlockPanda,28,Wed May 20 06:24:53 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that Urban decay is exclusive to Mecca and not Sephora. Personally, I think you should decide if you are an eyeshadow person and what kind or at least think about the eyeshadow looks you prefer.   A great alternative to the Naked palettes is the Lorac Pro palettes, which I think are better quality and a better mix of matte and shimmer shades. I think it is much more versatile and would recommend the Lorac Pro over any of the UD naked palettes any day. Or as /u/jessijames suggested, you could try the Chi Chi nudes palette to see if you like the colours etc."
AustralianMakeup,36g752,StrangeFarulf,7,Tue May 19 03:42:14 2015 UTC,I second Lorac Pro. I just bought a Naked palette and I feel like it doesn't go onto my eyelids as easily as Lorac does.
AustralianMakeup,36g752,walkyouhome,4,Tue May 19 04:04:28 2015 UTC,"Yep, and my Lorac Pro was only $65 on Amazon, which is a fair bit cheaper than Naked. As a fellow eyeshadow novice I find it so easy to use, especially the matte shades."
AustralianMakeup,36g752,Jessijames,1 point,Tue May 19 04:34:28 2015 UTC,Also another great suggestion OP! :)
AustralianMakeup,36g752,jamballdonut,1 point,Tue May 19 03:54:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your suggestion!  The lorac pro comes with a mini primer, Nice!, Definitely going to try chi chi. I always go for a natural no makeup, makeup look. I would like just an all rounder kinda thing. I did buy a cheap one from ebay, which are terrible. Now that I can afford high quality makeup, I have become a dear in headlights with eyeshadow. Same thing happened first time I went to sephora. Its very much a I dont know what im doing moment."
AustralianMakeup,36g752,tallulahblue,5,Tue May 19 04:21:33 2015 UTC,"I third Lorac Pro.  I honestly don't think the UD is worth it, or even that good quality.  I never reach for mine any more, because I have so many problems with it, and use my Pro pretty much every time I do my makeup.  Also think getting the Chi Chi one would be a good idea :)"
AustralianMakeup,36g752,elfies_,3,Tue May 19 05:36:25 2015 UTC,"I agree with going for Lorac Pro. I have pro 1 and 2 and reach for them every day. I also have Naked 2 and 3 and never reach for them. Eyeshadows aren't as soft and pigmented as Lorac.   I would disagree with everyone saying to try ChiChi though. I mean if you want to try out the colours, sure, but the quality is so much worse than Lorac. SOME ChiChi shadows are lovely, but a lot of them are powdery and lack pigmentation / don't blend very well. It's been pretty hit or miss for me, but mainly miss."
AustralianMakeup,36g752,laughingdugong,3,Tue May 19 08:58:48 2015 UTC,"Also letting you know that urban decay is exclusive to Mecca MAXIMA, the closest one to sydney sephora is the one in qvb. If you're headed to Pitt st, I'd suggest going into Myer too and have a play with some of the stila palettes at Mecca COSMETICA and the too faced chocolate bar palettes or natural eye/natural matte palettes at kit cosmetics. The smaller too faced palettes are really nice if you're just getting into eyeshadows since they've got a nice range, pigmentation and aren't too expensive"
AustralianMakeup,36g752,szarkasm,4,Wed May 20 06:13:12 2015 UTC,It's good but IMO the lorac pro has better pigmentation and it's cheaper than UD as well.

I started on this palette myself just to try a sample of their shadows, it's US $38 and has a good mix of a basic neutral light brown and black matte, gold and brown shimmers plus highlight shades. I generally find it's a perfect eye to complement any lip combo I do (of course Lorac 1 and Pro to Go leans quite warm, it depends how you like your shadows).   It also has a great bronzer and blush options and is my favourite travel palette!"

I dont think anyone has mentioned yet that if you do decide you want to try out Urban Decay nakeds or Lorac palettes, you could have a look on /r/MUE and /r/Aussiemakeupexchange and see if there are used palettes for cheaper. I got a very well used (about half the shadows had hit pan) Naked 1 on there for $25 shipped so that's definitely a good way to try things if you dont want to fully commit to the price tag :)"

AustralianMakeup,36g752,DarkHatexx,3,Tue May 19 09:18:36 2015 UTC,"I don't have the money to spend on UD eyeshadow palettes, so I opted for ""dupes"" by different brands instead. Particularly Makeup Revolution! I recently bought a bunch of their eyeshadow palettes online and even did swatches here. They're under $14  ( from memory) and international shipping costed only $15! I sound like I'm advertising for them lol... There are brands in Australia with dupes for the Naked palettes as well, e.g. Chi Chi, BYS. Hope I helped!!

AustralianMakeup,36g752,starla_,3,Tue May 19 04:38:04 2015 UTC,"I guess the question is - do you like glittery shades or mattes? Do you feel like you will get a lot of use out of them? Or are you just buying the palette for the sake of buying it?  Definitely read reviews (good and bad!) and weigh it up - go on Pinterest and see what looks from what palette appeal to you most and physically see yourself wearing. Maybe you're the kind of person who only needs one palette, so make it a good one :)"
AustralianMakeup,36g752,score1fortheprincess,2,Tue May 19 12:55:57 2015 UTC,The Chi Chi palettes are a reasonably priced alternative for someone starting out. They have nude/natural ones (can't remember the exact name). You can pick them up in Target or Myer.
AustralianMakeup,36g752,Rocha_999,2,Tue May 19 03:52:53 2015 UTC,"Personally I say yes they're worth it, if you're into those neutral shimmer shades. I have all three (though only paid Mecca AU pricing for #3) and love the quality and colours. I get zero fallout (though I always use a primer, because ... why wouldn't you??) and they stay gorgeous all day. Very little matte shades in the range though, so it's more about what you think you'll wear."

AustralianMakeup,369b0l,breviloquent-,1 point,Mon May 18 03:44:00 2015 UTC,I think Mecca sells Murad. Tarte you can get from Sephora Sydney otherwise you might have to resort to eBay as I've never been able to find an Amazon seller who ships to Australia.

AustralianMakeup,3695hw,score1fortheprincess,2,Sun May 17 11:29:16 2015 UTC,"Graftobian cosmetics glitter has lip sparkle as a suggested use, so I'd say it should be lipsafe. I've seen it online at several stores but have never tried it myself. I know CCA cosmetics sell it and I've had good experience buying lip tar from them."
AustralianMakeup,3695hw,scarletwombat,2,Sun May 17 22:58:37 2015 UTC,"Definitely look into the glitter lips Australia kits, they are a little pricey but stick very well due to the attachment compound and you can get 8+ hours of wear out of them"

AustralianMakeup,3695hw,Pandarmonium,1 point,Mon May 18 00:41:10 2015 UTC,"I bought a glitter lip tattoo for cheap from Cosmetics Plus and it worked well. The lip tattoo is always huge, so you can just cut it to the shape of your lips before applying, or apply it to your lips and trim the excess. You can also try putting on a pigmented lipstick, kissing a piece of paper, and then using that as a stencil to get the correct shape of your lips."
AustralianMakeup,3695hw,nixedreamer,1 point,Mon May 18 17:08:50 2015 UTC,You could use edible glitter? :)

AustralianMakeup,3695hw,Jessijames,1 point,Sun May 17 21:34:34 2015 UTC,"I have no experience with lip glitter unfortunately - but in regards to very finely milled craft glitter, while typically non toxic, and as a solid object, it should be able to pass through your system if ingested quite easily, I would suggest caution if you have or suspect you have any digestive issues as craft glitter can begin clumping together in the moisture of your intestines and cause an almost 'sand paper' type effect on it's walls.  Less likely to happen to an average healthy individual, but more likely to really inflame the gastric tract of someone with Ulcerative Cholitis, Chrons or Diverticulitis."

AustralianMakeup,3657k7,jamballdonut,2,Sat May 16 06:41:48 2015 UTC,"(Unfortunately, it's not $2.80 here like everywhere else, and if you're looking for it, you have to go through to the ""expensive"" section (For anyone unfamiliar with Kawaii, when you walk in, everything in that section is $2.80, and when you walk through the beeper things (What are they called??) everything is randomly priced, depending on value) and it's kind of near the back on the end of the one of the little aisle things.)  Anyway, I picked up 2, but the person I found out from said that the lady who works there said they get them in all the time (Even though I go there all the time and have never seen them there?!) But! I thought it would be exciting for people who can't travel to a different state just to get a sponge/brush cleaner, haha!"
AustralianMakeup,3657k7,Lunawinter,1 point,Sat May 16 06:43:35 2015 UTC,"Honestly i'd still be very happy to pay 3.95, it's so good and often so hard to find that the price is worth it to use it!"

AustralianMakeup,3652pn,doliblu,6,Sat May 16 05:35:44 2015 UTC,Hmmm....a whole brush set for $15 strikes me as strange too. Problem is they're up against the Chemist Warehouse sale and I just don't think I could bring myself to pay full price on Maybelline for a free gift (that might not suit me) when they're half price somewhere else.
AustralianMakeup,3652pn,doliblu,3,Sat May 16 07:34:43 2015 UTC,"Right? That's less one full-price RT brush in Priceline. Must be either the tiniest or the shittiest brushes ever.

AustralianMakeup,364s3b,Twerkle-Belle,4,Sat May 16 03:25:51 2015 UTC,Even the cheap ebay versions of the Z Palettes are barely a few dollars less. I've been looking around myself and am likely going to just bite the bullet and go for the Z's over the only slightly cheaper ebay versions as the quality will likely be worth the small difference. Finding something significantly cheaper you might be out of luck! I'm wanting to buy from MUG soon myself and might even buy the Z Palettes from there while I'm at it if it doesn't hike up the shipping too much but it probably will and I may as well just buy them locally!
AustralianMakeup,364s3b,Jessijames,3,Sat May 16 04:47:45 2015 UTC,"just bought this ebay palette and took out the black insert for eyeshadows and it works great!!! and so cheap, like 20 buck for the z no thank u http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/161694423802?_trksid=p2060353.m2749.l2649&ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT"
AustralianMakeup,364s3b,victreebelle95,1 point,Wed May 20 03:49:39 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what I've been thinking too! Are the Z Pallettes really worth that price? If they are I'll probably end up biting the bullet, I already have a list of the next shades I want to buy so I may as well throw in a pallette while I'm at it. I've been hoping there was an alternative though :("
AustralianMakeup,364s3b,starward-,4,Sat May 16 04:58:51 2015 UTC,"If you did want to go the DIY route, you can buy magnetic sheets from Daiso for $2.80. It's got 100 magnets cut into small squares (like small enough they would fit under a pan) and can be glued into whatever you wanted to make into a palette (e.g. an old book, a CD cover)"
AustralianMakeup,364s3b,thexcheshirexcat,1 point,Sat May 16 05:45:54 2015 UTC,That is actually a fantastic idea. I might pursue that route if I can find some sort of pallette-like container. Thanks for the tip!
AustralianMakeup,364s3b,Stinkysnarly,1 point,Sat May 16 05:51:51 2015 UTC,"I was going to say the exact same thing haha. I bought the magnetic strips and a couple of cheap tins of pencils (tossed out the pencils) and just made them myself. They work well enough, just not quite as elegant as the z-palette...but considering the savings, I'm not complaining! Typo usually has some cute tins if you'd like something prettier"
AustralianMakeup,364s3b,nixedreamer,2,Mon May 18 04:32:25 2015 UTC,The cheapest option I've found are the z palettes from MUG themselves

It's lucky I love it too much to be overshadowed by the 3/4 drawer pull out length.    I'm not sure about height, but when I was looking, I was planning on buying this NILS Stool."

AustralianMakeup,35s3sa,Jessijames,2,Wed May 13 01:22:02 2015 UTC,Are the wall lamps attached to the wall or have you attached them to the mirror? They look attached but on the off chance they're not I'd love to know how you went about it. I live in a rental and getting good lighting for early morning/night time is a constant battle and I wanted these but clearly cannot go installing lighting onto a wall as I see fit when I don't own the house.
AustralianMakeup,35s3sa,dinkykate,2,Wed May 13 01:23:00 2015 UTC,"In my case they are attached to the wall.    But I have seen a few girls on /r/MakeupAddiction make their own wooden mirror frames, and attach the lights to that, which adds portability for girls in your situation!    PM me if needed, and I can find the examples I saw and send them to you :)"
AustralianMakeup,35s3sa,oheyitsdee,2,Wed May 13 01:25:44 2015 UTC,"Examples would be excellent! I ended up buying this sucker and getting my electrician Dad so put a plug on the end of it but it isn't super stable because it's so heavy and..round. I am on the hunt for a 'plate holder' stand thing thats big and sturdy enough to prop it up but haven't had any luck.  Also, yes your battlestation looks amazing. Sorry I didn't mention that in my original comment! I am torn between desks so I haven't gotten around to purchasing a new one for myself yet.

What do you think of the lights in reference to your makeup? Are you happy with the realism of colour? Does it reflect well?  I also wasn't wanting to get an electrician to install them, but seeing your vanity. I am seriously considering doing it! Yours looks dope !! Great job :)"

I just really can't think of anything else in the colourful lip liner range that you wouldn't be paying more than $10 a pencil for.

But I hope so, I think they're doing really well with the current ranges they've got out, and it's really good to see an Aussie company finally bringing out some exciting products IMO, especially at the reasonable prices they've got right now.

AustralianMakeup,35smb2,Jessijames,2,Wed May 13 04:06:30 2015 UTC,Mini-review in album. I'd love to know anyone else's thoughts/experience with this balm - it's a totally new thing to me!  I wonder how similar to the Stila balm this is? I feel like it might also be very similar to the new 'blotting stick' from Benefit - neither of which I have tried myself but have looked at purchasing at some point.  Also on my lips is another lunchtime purchase of Revlon's new Ultra HD Lipstick line in Poppy..in love. Hoping it might stave off my inevitable purchase of NARS Heat Wave for a little while longer (although it's a warm red it's not quite as orange-red as Heat Wave but from swatches it looks close.) - the formula feels divine although is a little tricky to apply accurately right from the tube.

AustralianMakeup,35s2c1,katelynrose25,1 point,Wed May 13 06:37:04 2015 UTC,were they Natural and Classic Ivory? the only one that looks decent in the lighter shades is creamy beige but that'd still be too dark for you?
AustralianMakeup,35s2c1,gospursgo_,2,Wed May 13 06:42:10 2015 UTC,"I have horrible under eye circles, so I've used quite a few undereye concealers.  I haaaaate LA Girl Pro Conceal - I'm cool-toned, and it was just WAY too pink for me, as well as being just thick and gross and hard to blend and just ugh, an absolute nightmare.  I love using the Maybelline Fit Me, but only as a face concealer, since it creases like crazy under my eyes and I need about 3 layers to get decent coverage.  I'm currently using the Maybelline Instant Age Rewind in Brightener, but that provides practically no coverage, is hard to blend/smooth into the skin & fades away after about an hour.  My favourite would definitely be the Rimmel Wake Me Up (1 layer normally does me, but sometimes 2 is what I need) - it is quite yellowy, but that doesn't actually appear THAT noticeable on my skin, and so far it's been the best that I've used (I never liked it that much, until I tried others and realised it's just so much better than them!)"
AustralianMakeup,35s2c1,jamballdonut,2,Wed May 13 09:39:35 2015 UTC,"I realise that this is not an answer to your question, but as a fellow dark-eye-circle sufferer I thought I'd provide some other possibly (hopefully?) helpful knowledge!   I find applying my blush a bit higher on my cheekbones helps to make shadows less obvious. I  recommend a Garnier 'eye roll-on' stick on really bad days. It looks like a pen and has a ball applicator on the end. I think it has caffeine in it. Seems to improve the actual dark colour, so I apply it first thing in the morning while I have breakfast. The little tube has lasted me a very very long time."
AustralianMakeup,35s2c1,Waffleshoot,2,Wed May 13 09:39:54 2015 UTC,"I have the LA girl pro concealer in Creamy Beige and I really like it! I will say that it's definitely not a concealer you'd use to blend with your hands, I found that I needed a brush for it to look natural and not cakey because it's a thick, full coverage concealer. I also found that the texture can be a bit weird when you first put it on so I prefer to smooth it onto the back of my hand before picking it up with a brush. It's definitely a good concealer for the price, if you don't mind the slightly more fussy application technique it requires.  I feel that Maybelline Fit Me doesn't have the coverage I need with my dark circles. It definitely blends well, but I don't think it's as heavy-duty as what I look for in a dark-circles under-eye concealer!  Honestly, the best thing I've used for my under-eyes is the Nars Creamy concealer... I know you were looking for drugstore but it's such a good multi-purpose full coverage concealer if you're willing to invest!"
AustralianMakeup,35s2c1,ailee612,2,Wed May 13 14:04:40 2015 UTC,"haven't tried the la girl pro concealer, but i've tried basically everything available in priceline. and ive also come to the conclusion that i HATE wearing concealer under my eyes, but these are the ones i do quite like:     maybelline age rewind it's a bit on the pricey side for ""drugstore"" but this is probably my favourite in terms of consistency and coverage, it's really easy to blend out and it does cover and brighten quite nicely. i do worry about the spongetip getting dirty after a while but i haven't had any issues with infections or anything nasty so i suppose whatever maybelline claimed to put on it (i dont remember it was some fancy antibacterial gimmick) seems to work   innoxa lasting cover concealer this is actually a really good quality concealer, innoxa have some really incredible products that are often overlooked, this is one of them. it's high coverage and it doesn't settle into lines, it actually erases them. my only issue is that it's quite stiff if you want to use it underneath your eyes i'd definitely recommend warming it up very well   rimmel wake me up i have a love/hate with this one, i love how creamy and brightening it is and how easy it is to apply but i hate the fact that it sinks into lines after say 4ish hours. it's not incredibly noticeable, but it just creases more than the other ones i've listed, but i just so love the consistency of this stuff. and it's cheap, i got this on sale with my staff discount and a voucher so it was really a ""can't go wrong"" purchase for me     sorry for the text block! really hope that helps"

AustralianMakeup,35s11v,cinwonxo,2,Wed May 13 00:57:07 2015 UTC,"I think they key for undereye concealer at least for me in my experience is don't use too much. Find a good concealer with the right level of coverage you need so you don't need to cake it on, that way you can lightly apply it and move on. Also make sure you set/powder it but again use a really light finely milled powder. I find lightly applying reduces the under eye creasing for me although to be honest it's rare for my undereyes to crease anyway so I might just be lucky?"
AustralianMakeup,35oie0,DarkHatexx,5,Tue May 12 05:37:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah I hate the smell of the CG foundation bleh. It almost reminds me a little of the MAC Studio Fix fluid which reminds me of paint...Once they're on my face though I don't really notice it though!  Edit: The only foundation I have ever used that smelled SO DAMN BAD that I refused to keep using it was the Covergirl 'Clean Liquid Makeup' in the almost pyramid shaped bottle. That stuff made me GAG and then when I moved out of home at like 19 with my best friend we had to share a bathroom and to my absolute horror this was her holy grail at the time. I wanted to die every time I had to get ready after she had just done her foundation for work hahaha It would make everything stink. I shudder just thinking about it. I am currently fighting an uphill battle to get her to change foundations...She splurged on Laura Mercier and was both colour matched horribly and has the misfortune of it oxidising TERRIBLY. She came to stay with me last weekend and I watched her put it on...threw a packet of makeup wipes at her and said take it off, I will put something else on you."

This year, starting in Autumn I've hard a dry itchy spot between the eyebrows again, and now also at the edges of my nose and behind my ears. The dryness also seemed worse, it was obviously flaky once I put liquid foundation on. I realised that it wasn't just dry skin when I would use use balm every night and it just wouldn't change...

Despite lots of emollients, it still looked dry and cranky 3. The worst areas are where my skin usually tends to get oiliest 4. Flare ups in cold weather.  I've only recently started the Moogoo Eczema and Psoriasis cream (original one), as I've had lots of luck with their moisturising creams before, and none of the ingredients have given me acne before. It's a licensed anti-fungal and anti-inflammatory. As I've only started it I don't think I can give you an honest opinion yet :) I'll probably try Egoderm ointment next if the Moogoo cream doesn't work. The Egoderm ointment contains zinc, something that the Moogoo cream doesn't have."

AustralianMakeup,35k9t1,imwittier,1 point,Mon May 11 11:04:09 2015 UTC,"I dye my hair and the T Gel is fine for me (both the coal tar and the other one. I prefer the other one though, which is slightly more expensive, but less drying on the scalp). I've also used Nizoral and didn't notice any colour stripping, but it also dried my scalp out hardcore and made my dandruff worse. I wouldn't recommend the Cedel one, because it strips colour and leaves my hair all stringy and dry and gross"

AustralianMakeup,35k9t1,apasserby,3,Mon May 11 07:20:41 2015 UTC,Hello fellow curly! Sukin and Natural Instincts conditioners are both silicone free. Sukin is good if your hair likes protein and Natural Instincts is great if you prefer to co-wash over low-poo.   Also! I can give you a list of products available in Australia that are curly girl approved if you like. Just PM me :)
AustralianMakeup,35k9t1,pickletrain,2,Mon May 11 10:14:20 2015 UTC,"I highly recommend the Yes to Cucumbers shampoo, and the Tresemmé Naturals conditioner. I have not tried the Yes to Carrots conditioner but people have done good reviews on it, so I might give it a try too.  Edit: just with the Yes to Carrots conditioner, it apparently has an agent that will gum up if you leave this in your hair, so I'd say use this as a rinse out only conditioner if you're planning on buying it"

It's VERY low coverage, so won't cover any imperfections or dark circles, but does a reaaaaaaaaally good job of covering up my redness (I get VERY red cheeks and nose) so was very happy about that! Altogether, I think it's pretty decent for the sale price, and would recommend picking it up! (The colour match is also pretty amazing too.  I'm about a NC10-15 and picked up Vanilla [the lightest cool-toned one] which matches beautifully and just blends into my skin so well)"

Its nice for weekend days when you don't really want a full face but you just want something light and you know you're only heading out to the shops or something you don't need it to last allllllll day long or anything (because I'm oily, if you have dry skin you will probably get a decent day of wear out of it anyway!)"

AustralianMakeup,35gs17,smilingsunbeams,1 point,Sun May 10 06:13:44 2015 UTC,"I went to the sale after work and arrived there approximately around 7:30pm and it was very calm and orderly unlike the last one I went to which was in Collingwood - way too packed for my liking (pram strollers everywhere, kids crying, ladies going crazy and grabbing everything).   I ended up buying:  Essence Shimmer Pearls (Me & My Ice Cream collection) $2  Essence Cream Blush (Me & My Ice Cream collection) $2  Max Factor Lipfinity Lasting Lip Tint in 08 $3   Essence Oil Control Paper (Tribal Summer collection) $1  Covergirl Clean Glow Blush in Peaches $3  The total cost of my purchases was: $11.  I'm not sure as to why I got the Max Factor lip tint and the Covergirl blush for a dollar less each because there were signs stating that they were supposed to be $4.   The Covergirl blush was the highlight of the bunch, especially the middle colour - my cheeks are naturally pink so I always use corals & peaches as they compliment me much more. The blush isn't very pigmented (buildable) nor does it kick up very much product but for me personally it's great because I can easily overdose on blush. I only bought the Essence blush and the shimmer pearls because I missed out on those collections and the packaging is too pretty to pass up.   The shimmer pearls (S.Ps) are similar to the Guerlain Meteorites and though I don't have the latter in my collection, according to various reviews and swatches, the Guerlain S.Ps have a slightly more pink undertone compared to Essence S.Ps which are more champagne in colour. The Essence S.Ps contain glitter particles so it works better as a highlighter than an overall face powder. ELF also sells their own variation of the shimmer pearls on iherb. I remember seeing the lip tint from the last sale in Collingwood so I picked up one and it's much better than the ELF lip stain which dried up on me after a couple of uses. I didn't get very much but I'm still very happy with everything I picked up from the sale. :)  P.s: swatched on NC20/25 skin"

AustralianMakeup,35ejyb,Shiavo,12,Sat May 9 16:06:00 2015 UTC,I don't know if it's a beauty trick or whatever… but I used to apply concealer to any scars/pimples after foundation (this was before I kinda got into YouTube/the online beauty community). After seeing a few people do concealer first then foundation I decided to try it that way and it's made so much of a difference to how my make up looks. I usually only use 3/4 of a pump of foundation now and it makes my skin look so natural yet flawless. Best thing I've probably learnt since getting more into make up.
AustralianMakeup,35ejyb,reddit-g,1 point,Sat May 9 22:14:13 2015 UTC,What type of concealer and foundation do you use for this?    I haven't had much success but I was using liquid concealer then a liquid foundation which I am guessing is my problem?
AustralianMakeup,35ejyb,assaulted_peanuts,7,Sat May 9 23:02:09 2015 UTC,"Using liquid isn't a problem at all. You just have to stipple on your foundation after concealer, because any kind of buffing or painting motion will move your concealer around."
AustralianMakeup,35ejyb,SEXPILUS,2,Sun May 10 00:27:58 2015 UTC,"Aaah, I've been using a sponge. Thanks for the tip :)"
AustralianMakeup,35ejyb,assaulted_peanuts,3,Sun May 10 22:51:54 2015 UTC,"I'm using liquid concealer and foundation so I don't think that's the issue! I've been using the bourjois healthy mix foundation and maybelline fit me concealer (which I probably won't repurchase because the lightest shade is too pink for me).   I usually am more careful around where I've concealed when applying foundation (usually my jawline). As /u/SEXPILUS said, stippling is the best way to go otherwise you'll move it around. I also usually let it ""settle in"" before foundation, so I'll do my eyebrows in between."

Feel like I might have to make a trip to Mecca to find something fair and quite yellow."
AustralianMakeup,35ejyb,reddit-g,1 point,Sun May 10 23:03:39 2015 UTC,I use a concealer that is a bit too yellow for me - Estee Lauder Double Wear Stay In Place Flawless Wear Concealer SPF 10 (01 Light). You could possible check that out? It's pretty pricey though :S     Everyone raves about the NARS Radiant Creamy Concealer which is a touch cheaper.

AustralianMakeup,35ejyb,nixedreamer,4,Sun May 10 09:43:00 2015 UTC,"I just get jojoba oil from a health food store :) It's technically a wax ester, not an oil. It's the closest thing that you can get to your skin's sebum, so your skin is more likely to ""accept"" it. I've been using it as a moisturizer for years.  If there's another oil, like argan or sweet almond, you prefer, you can use those instead :) It's good to figure out what your skin likes and when mixing it with makeup, what makes your makeup look it's best :)"
AustralianMakeup,35ejyb,starward-,3,Sun May 10 12:11:50 2015 UTC,"Just as another rec - my skin drinks macadamia oil. It's also quite close to sebum, and has a soft nutty smell (but if you don't like nuts, please stay away!). My skin has never been as soft and it's helped out my sensitive skin heaps.

I get fairly greasy hair if I exercise/sweat or don't wash my hair every few days. I can change that in under 5 minutes with dry shampoo.  I was not at all sold at first, because I have dark hair, and it comes out of the tin so white. But I persevered, and it has been the best thing I have learned to do in terms of beauty.  I can turn an old blow-dry into a  brand new one. I can sweat it out at my fitness class and then go to work with fresh hair.  It's all about how you apply it. Small, short bursts right at the root, all over the head. Let is sit for 10-20 seconds, then massage it through the hair. You can even tip your head forward and shake out any excess."

I can use my blackest black, quickly rub my brush over the sponge and then go into a crease colour and have no trace of the black. I find I use less brushes overall now and I no longer feel the urge to buy every blending brush I come across.  This doesn't replace regular deep cleaning, but it is such a handy tool to have around when doing complicated eye looks."

AustralianMakeup,35gefb,digitalcatbox,3,Sun May 10 02:32:59 2015 UTC,I'd probably get a lipstick and fix+ or a paint pot from mac.

AustralianMakeup,35gefb,freezethefire,2,Sun May 10 03:47:54 2015 UTC,I would buy TheBalm products since they're exclusive to DJs. :) Maybe their tinted moisturizer? I also love their eyeshadow primer and they also have pretty blushes.

If you want to purchase international (especially European) brands I daresay it might be more expensive since their import tax is so high. Before Sephora opened in Sydney I would have said its worth it, but now not so much. If you do want to buy Korean and Japanese brands there are a lot of sites that ship to Australia, check out /r/asianbeauty :) Edit: my experience is mostly from department stores, I've never shopped online in China but taobao is their version of eBay.

AustralianMakeup,35db9j,MsOrangeCake,2,Sat May 9 14:12:25 2015 UTC,"Eye primers are frequently used underneath eyes to make concealer last longer and stop it from creasing.

On my nc20-25 lady danger is the most true red-orange, heat wave is more red than orange but still obviously red-orange and red square is more orange than red but not too orange. Of the three formulas I prefer heat wave, red square and lady danger in that order, I've always had trouble with Mac lipsticks being a tad more drying than most lipsticks but it's not to the point it's severely uncomfortable. Red square is my favourite to apply because the pencil makes it super easy to fill in quite precisely without a brush. Though overall I'd say heat wave is my favourite of the bunch as its quite well rounded and easy to pull off :)"

I have the Luxe complete set, and also purchased a couple of extras on top of that so an extra of the fluffy blending brush (MAC 217 dupe IIRC) and a different blush brush - Luxe Sheer Cheek 127 or something and I think the Luxe Face Finish. I've owned them for probably just under 6 months now, wash them all every week or so depending on just how dirty they are and have had no shedding or fraying so far. They wash back to the lovely white and I haven't experienced any staining either even with the use of dark shadows!

They seem like such nice people so I don't want to cut off their profit margin too much with a middleman, especially seeing the prices are similar."
AustralianMakeup,35c8re,bambikai,1 point,Sat May 9 14:13:44 2015 UTC,It's just the shipping costs I'm trying to avoid :( beautybay is the same price but with free shipping.
AustralianMakeup,359s07,xenomorphic_acid,2,Fri May 8 08:22:33 2015 UTC,"I don't own(yet!) any of the lipsticks in the first image, I swatched them all in store. I was only going to look at Sportsgirl but I went in to Target so I swatched a few random ones that took my eye.  Top L-R: Sportsgirl - Midnight, Dark Angel, Whirlwind, Love Bite, Bitten  Bottom L-R, NYX Snow White, NYX Violet Ray, NYX Chaos, Chi Chi Let Me Tempt You  One of the lipsticks I was actually looking for at Sportsgirl was Onyx, but it wasn't there! There was also a top I liked, but it wasn't in my size so I figured I'd buy online and get Onyx as well even though I knew the website photos weren't accurate. $9.95 isn't too expensive so I thought I'd take the chance.  I'm glad I did! The colour was hard to accurately capture with my tablet camera, but I can best describe it as a dark blackened purple. The colour at the base of the tube isn't accurate, it's too warm. It's not quite as glossy in real life and even with a rushed messy application it's quite pigmented. After wiping it off, it leaves a cool dark pink stain on the lips, which is actually really pretty.  It's not pictured, but later I tried it with the Australis matte lipstick base, which takes the shine off a little and also brings the grey out much more. I think I'll eventually go back for Midnight, Dark Angel, possibly Whirlwind and Chaos.  Also, it was my first time ordering from Sportsgirl and I will definitely be ordering again. I placed the order during business hours Wednesday, it was shipped Thursday, and arrived today (Friday). Express with tracking and signature required. All the stuff was inside a Sportsgirl fabric shopping bag, my order sheet was in a brightly coloured cardboard sleeve, and the lipstick was bubble wrapped and put inside a small fabric drawstring bag. Really nice presentation and packaging, and it was free shipping because I ordered over $50. (Order was $52)"
AustralianMakeup,359s07,goofygooberrock,1 point,Fri May 8 08:43:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this! I love Sportsgirl lippies, they are really good quality with interesting shades for the price. I'm still desperate to get Orange Crush."
AustralianMakeup,359s07,jamballdonut,1 point,Fri May 8 11:49:57 2015 UTC,"I own Midnight & Whirlwind and they're both absolutely beautiful.  Midnight is just the LOVELIEST formula I've ever tried, which is kind of a shame, because it's not really a colour I can wear very often, haha, and Whirlwind is just such a beautiful grey/lilac.  I'd highly recommend them!"
AustralianMakeup,359s07,whereismydragon,1 point,Fri May 8 12:51:37 2015 UTC,"Brilliant, thanks! I still need that teal, hnngh.  Anyone who was after Onyx because they wanted a dark grey, may I recommend Pewter Cauldron from Portland Black Lipstick Company? You can get it from Beauty Bohemia which is an Aussie distributor. She ships super fast :)"
AustralianMakeup,35axlh,violetbang,6,Fri May 8 16:10:30 2015 UTC,"The easiest way is probably to use the flat rate satchels which cost $8.25. You'd be able to fit a lot of ColourPop in there, but you'd also need bubble wrap. Australia Post also have flat rate envelopes. Medium C5 or Large C4 would be sufficient if the buyer was just ordering their lippie stix/lippie pencils (the max width of these envelopes is 2 cm), but I don't think you'd be able to have much padding.   These are probably the cheapest way to ship things within Australia, and especially if you use the prepaid options, you'll know exactly how much each person needs to pay for shipping their items within Australia. I've also found they get to where they're going in about 5 days.  Edited to clarify"
AustralianMakeup,35axlh,LemonCake_,3,Fri May 8 23:47:15 2015 UTC,"Either use prepaid envelopes and satchels, or calculate the postage after you have the order. :)  Maybe see if people want to meet up if they live in the same city? But that might make things too complex for you, so it's up to you.  I'm definitely in, I'll be ordering lip products only so they will be able to go letter mail."

AustralianMakeup,35axlh,cate171,1 point,Tue May 19 07:52:08 2015 UTC,"Hi NSW peeps, I'm happy to arrange an order from our state if u/violetbang and u/Jessijames aren't interested in an Australia wide order.  However, it'll only really be worth ordering if at least five or more of us (ideally 10 or more) are interested in ordering at least 2-3 products each, giving that shipping is as follows:   1 x eyeshadow/lippie               US$12.52 10 x eyeshadows/lippies          US$21.26 20 x eyeshadows/lippies          US$28.30 1 x cheek product (approx)      US$16.19 10 x cheek products (approx)   US$25.96 20 x cheek products (approx)   US$32.99   NB: these prices are approximate because of the bonus eyeshadow, so in the cart I had the bonus plus 1, 9, and 19 items respectively.  I live in Wollongong, so could arrange for pickup from UOW or a similar public place if anyone is local. If not, I would prefer to ship the items in Auspost padded bags, which are only a few dollars each +shipping (including the bag this is unlikely to exceed AU$10). This could be to individuals or to centralised peeps for pickup (e.g. someone in Sydney could recieve all the inner/western/northern Sydney items and pickup could be arranged from them, greatly reducing costs).  If anyone is interested, or someone more experienced is willing to arrange the order, reply to this comment and either I will start a new thread tomorrow evening with more details, or a more experienced/willing person can volunteer and start a thread first."

AustralianMakeup,355vhk,LeahBrahms,7,Sun May 10 06:40:26 2015 UTC,"Loving:   Models Prefer soft touch powders. Oh my gosh. These are so lovely. So so so lovely. Soft and fine and don't fluff product everywhere but make me look flawless.  Bourjois happy light foundation. So lovely and glowy and it doesn't set weird so it's easy to apply and blend and it's just lovely.  Real Techniques beauty sponge and expert face brush make drugstore foundation look better than I ever could have imagined.  Nivea Q10 sunscreen anti wrinkle magic cream. Skincare I guess but it's so lovely and wearable under makeup and I think I have a problem with the word lovely.    Not loving:    Australis fresh and flawless liquid foundation. It's weird. It's sticky and it sets weird and makes my face look flaky and patchy and just weird. Looks acceptable mixed with moisturiser and blended beyond belief.  Maybelline fit me foundation stick. Gross as hell. It's like rubbing a fat stick of chalk on my face. It's so dry. One of the few products pale enough for me but I just have no idea how to wear it.  Australis ready set go translucent powder. The product is fine, excellent really, but when it gets caught in the threads of the jar and squeaks and creaks I gag. What terrible awful packaging. Considering depotting it into a glass jar with muslin over the top."

AustralianMakeup,355vhk,duneacha,2,Fri May 8 00:46:52 2015 UTC,It's just the worst. My Revlon powder is nearly out so I might depot my models prefer powder into that and then the ready set go into the models prefer container bc it has a hinge lid rather than a threaded one. So many possibilities because the current packaging is not an option at all.
AustralianMakeup,355vhk,criti_biti,2,Thu May 7 12:09:20 2015 UTC,That sounds like a good idea. I already decant my loose powder into a smaller jar for convenience anyway. It is such a nice product.

Tbh, i can't imagine that it would make a massive difference which one you used, as they're all fairly translucent. However, i think the 2 lighter (pinkish) toned ones suit highlighting better.  They make for amazingly natural highlights, and completely blur any unevenness / shoddy blending of my foundation. I am so, so in love with these. They don't leave any sparkles on your skin, so it looks like it's just your skin that's glowy."

AustralianMakeup,355vhk,DoctorPoo25,6,Fri May 8 02:45:27 2015 UTC,"I keep hearing such great things about those Models Prefer Soft Touch Powders, I really must pick one up myself (especially because I'm too stingy to buy the Hourglass ones!)  At the moment I really love:  Heroine Make Long & Curl Mascara - good for people who have tiny straight little jerk eyelashes   Revlon Balm Stains - I keep forgetting how good these are, they're perfect for dry winter lips because I find most shades are really forgivable when your lips are a bit flakey.  They're quite hydrating too.  Essence Clear Brow Gel - I picked this up because I was looking for a cheap brow gel that didn't make my brows crunchy.  I was originally hoping to get the new savvy one but it wasn't in stock locally but I found this and I love it :D  Ugly ass packaging though."
AustralianMakeup,355vhk,Flippantry,3,Thu May 7 12:33:49 2015 UTC,The soft touch powders are really beautiful. I really recommend the pinky toned one if you have cool tones.

Maybelline Colour Tattoo in Barely Branded and Bad to the Bronze. All about dat base. Essence Gel pencil liners for tightlining. Still transfers, but so much less than other pencils. Accidentally tried to sharpen one though. Maybelline Age Rewind Concealer, but on blemishes only! It's shithouse under my eyes. Australis Fresh and Flawless pressed powder, but as a foundation rather than a setting powder. So smooth and doesn't look powdery when topped with Soft Touch.   Not Loving:   Maybelline Dream Lumi Concealer. Nice concept, so many creases. To Faced Primed and Poreless. I mean like it's not bad but the Rimmel just outperforms it so I'm getting resentful. Covergirl Flamed Out Mascara. Flaky and takes several coats to get anything that stand out behind my glasses. Should have known with that tacky name and packaging. Australis Matte Out stick thing. You had one job."

So gorgeous and lightly coral on my lips!! This is now my go-to on days my lips feel too dry/damaged for proper lippies. Bourjois Healthy Mix Foundation - so sunny, golden and soft on me! My skin's been super dry, so I'm avoiding all powder, and this manages to look just gorgeous on it's own. Chi Chi sponge - my first ever sponge, and I'm loving it! I got the RT sponge, but it's a lot firmer and I'm not sure I'm a fan of that. Before this I used fingers for liquid/concealer, and this is a big upgrade. Liquid mattes in general. I'm a really lazy person, so getting these in formulas that just stay all day is a godsend. Completely unrelated - Agents of SHIELD! Finally watching it (catching up on all the Marvel shows) and I'm a massive fan. Almost up to date :)   Not loving     LA Splash Untamed - got four of these in the recent shipping discount promo. Latte Confession was really nice, and Untamed is a magnificent colour. The wear however ... ! I'm used to liquid mattes being long-wearing like Provocalips and similar ones - this was great for a few hours, then as soon as I ate or drank it started wearing off around the edges. I re-applied at some point, but by the end of the day it was flaking off and felt horrible. Still love the colour, but will be keeping this for short stints now. My skin :( It's getting better now, but for a week or two there I was extraordinarily dry while also being covered in pimples. Pimples are mostly cleared up now, just the discolouration left, and skin is sloooowly getting there."

Went for a new one in a lighter shade since the other one didn't match anymore and I suddenly ran out. The lady at Priceline matched me amazingly well (surprise) to another revlon colorstay (since I said I know it works for what I want). She used the dry skin one since my skin is completely clear now and dry when it was before oily and had acne. (Yay nee BHA).   Patches. Everywhere. It's soooo patchy and WILL NOT buff. IT WILL NOT BUFF NO MATTER WHAT I DO I HATE IT SO MUCH. It soaks into my skin in weird places and looks sooooooooooooo bad. I haven't changed anything in my routine (makeup or skincare) to cause this. It's so shit. I've planned on upgrading to UD foundation anyway for a while , but needed something as my foundation ran out suddenly and didn't have enough time to go and sample. So I have to use this shit.   I've actually been avoiding using it and have only been using powder. I'd rather have half my makeup off by the end of my work day than use that shitty foundation. But unfortunately I need a full face for my internship which sucks. /rant   Also just shoutout to how amazing my brows are thanks to Dipbrow.

AustralianMakeup,355vhk,pumpkinspicevodka,2,Fri May 8 11:28:17 2015 UTC,"Loving:  Models Prefer CC cream in Light - I'm got pink undertones and have dry skin that is also prone to breakouts but this stuff somehow balances both of these problems and makes me look like I have nice skin! It eliminated my pinkness without making me look yellow, and lasts pretty well when I wear it with primer. I'd say it gives medium coverage, and a little goes a long way. Loving it.   Maybelline Master Precise Liquid Eyeliner - I'm pretty hopeless with regular liquid eyeliner but this eyeliner pen is my jam. I use it every single day to the point where I think I look weird without it and I don't know what I'd do if they discontinued it.   Lanolips 101 Ointment - again, my skin is dry, so I need hardcore lip balm that to make my lips feel nourished, and this stuff is it. It was $18 from Priceline and I stood at the lip balm rack and hemmed and hawed over the price (everything else was like $5) but I'm so glad I decided to buy it.   Not loving:   ELF eye primer in sheer - it makes my eye shadow last longer than if I used nothing, but by the end of the day my eye shadow still looks pretty rough. It's the only kind I've tried, so maybe my expectations are just too high. In the next week or so I'm planning to buy a different brand and see if that treats me any better (if anyone has any recommendations, I'd love to hear em).   Rimmel Moisture Renew lipstick in Soane's Plum - I bought this because the colour is so gorgeous, but it's just not a good product. It feels sort of slimy and just smears off my lips in minutes - no lasting power at all. Plus it smells awful (like expired lipstick mixed with the sort of potpourri my nana had in her bathroom). A huge shame, since I really do adore the colour."
AustralianMakeup,355vhk,teapottersparty,3,Thu May 7 13:15:38 2015 UTC,Lanolips is the freaking best! My lips have been amazing since I started using it. I could never go back to a regular balm now!

I have about 5 of these tubes on the go at the moment, in my car, in my desk drawer, in my netball bag, in my gym bag, in my handbag. Basically everywhere.

(i really wish i didn't like this stuff because it's SO expensive but) i have a sample sachet of the bobbi brown eye cream and i love it. i really doubt that it's worth the price it sells for though but i can understand why it's a luxury product - it's so nice!    ambivalent feelings   mac fix+. great product but i'm getting though it so quickly and it's not cheap. i only have the travel sized bottle but i've used it maybe 4 times and it's only 3/4 full now. :/ if anyone has a good dupe please let me know!   hate   nyx colour mascara in blue. the packaging broke after the 1st use. not happy jan. revlon bold lacquer mascara. got this as a freebie a while ago and only just opened it. i guess it's not the worst mascara in the world but it just doesn't do anything for me

AustralianMakeup,355vhk,damn-croissants,3,Thu May 7 22:44:49 2015 UTC,Ooh okay do you think it sets well? Are some shades too shimmery? Sorry for bombarding you with questions haha
AustralianMakeup,355vhk,asteroyale,1 point,Thu May 7 23:24:49 2015 UTC,no problemo! it isn't too shimmery - i actually find it quite subtle and it gives more of a glowy effect. i was a bit intimidated when i first swatched it with my finger but when you use a brush it looks beautiful.  it does set well however my skin is on the oiler side of things and i find that by the end of the work day i'm looking a little overly shiny. i can fix it a bit by blotting/powdering but then you do lose a bit of that glowiness.
AustralianMakeup,355vhk,damn-croissants,2,Fri May 8 00:15:49 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for responding!! So tempted to get some myself now seeing as my Rimmel Stay Matte has just hit pan :D

AustralianMakeup,355vhk,damn-croissants,2,Fri May 8 05:16:48 2015 UTC,"Loving:   Bourjois Healthy Mix Serum: my skin has changed from overly oily to somewhat dry over the past couple of years (goodbye teenage years), so my old super mattifying foundations weren't cutting it for me. This foundation makes my skin look so beautiful and glowy and it lasts all day with no hint of oil shining through :D Models Prefer Soft Touch Blush: Perfect amount of pigment and so blendable! No clown cheeks with this blush! Also perfect colour range! Maybelline Colour Drama Lipstick: WOW!! These are so pigmented and go on so well! They're very smooth and don't dry out my lips as the day goes on! Love love love these. The colour also fades off relatively evenly while eating. Plus I picked up all the shades except two from Chemist Warehouse for just under $5 each!! SO CHEAP! I wish they had a bigger colour range though.   Not Loving:    L'Oreal Infallible Concealer: it's a concealer stick that is so hard to apply! It's not a soft or creamy formula at all, and I have to use my warm finger to rub some off the stick then apply that to my face, which results in way less concealer actually making it onto my face! Plus the coverage is average. At least I bought it on sale... Maybelline Volum' Express Mega Plush Mascara: I don't even consider this a mascara. It went on so clumpy, no lengthening, no volumising, no anything. Worst mascara I've ever used."

AustralianMakeup,355vhk,sarkata,2,Fri May 8 12:47:38 2015 UTC,"Loving:   Tarte Amazonian Clay Foundation - I have a dinky sample of this from Sephora that's lasted me ages and I love it so much I suspect I'll need to invest in the full size. Super high coverage, moussey in texture, beautiful finish, lasts forever. I'm not even a foundation girl generally, but I can't stop using this. Usually when I put on a foundation and then check in on it hours later it's started to separate or settle strangely, but I've not had that happen with this after a ten to twelve hour period. Essence I Heart Nudes shadow in Sweet Like Chocolate - this shadow is amazing? It blends so nicely and has a lovely satin finish and it's the perfect super simple and polished all over the lid colour.  Fyrinnae Liquid Matte Lipstick in Dublin - I go on about these liquid matte lipsticks all the time and I promise you, it's with good reason. I've been wearing the hell out of Dublin, a beautiful deep green colour that I can put on and not have to fuss over. Face of Australia HD primer (green bottle) - this is the best silicon primer I have ever tried? It's so smoothing and I get much better wear with it, provided I don't use too much Solstice Scents Blackburn's Parlour perfume - a perfume has achieved success for me as soon as someone has hugged me and said anything to the tune of ""oh my god, you smell amazing"". Not only do I love that it's a rollerball, it lasts nicely (not as intensely as Kitchen by the same brand which will last for 12 hours on me) and when I'm wearing it I smell like a literal Banana Split Ice Cream Sundae, which is comforting and sweet now it's cooling down   Not loving:   I can't find my favourite Daiso $2.80 felt tip eyeliner at any of the stores in my vicinity  Melt Cosmetics Blow lipstick - don't get me wrong, I adore the colour of this (an intense green) but it was expensive as hell and it's the second of my melt lipsticks to snap in the tube. I've managed to melt it back Ito place for the moment, but as it's so dry and tugs, I doubt it will stay fixed for long."
AustralianMakeup,355vhk,miss_marshwiggle,2,Fri May 8 03:23:13 2015 UTC,I love love love that FoA primer. It's also the best silicone primer I've ever tried.

AustralianMakeup,355vhk,sarkata,1 point,Fri May 8 04:33:45 2015 UTC,Yes! I have to travel to get a hold of them (my local priceline doesn't stock them) but I'm on the lookout to replace mine now
AustralianMakeup,355vhk,amyeh,2,Fri May 8 05:31:17 2015 UTC,"Loving:   Urban Decay Naked Skin Weightless Complete Coverage Concealer - it is the perfect concealer for me. I'm really into a dewy, light, natural finish at the moment and this ticks all of the boxes. Covers my under eye discolouration like nothing else, dries enough that it doesn't move, but not so much that my eyes look worse. In love. Models Prefer Soft Touch Mineral Powder in Luminous Glow - I feel like a supermodel with this. I can put it all over my face and look like someone has taken a smoothing tool to my face and make it look like I actually know what I'm doing. I'm probably going to buy the other shades too, cause this one is slightly dark for my skin, but not bad enough to be noticeable.   Hating:   Rimmel Scandaleyes Rockin' Curves Mascara - I got this from the Priceline offer, and at first I thought it was great. I've since changed my mind. It's so wet, it ends up all over my face and my lashes get clumpy. The brush is a stupid design too."
AustralianMakeup,355vhk,LemonCake_,1 point,Fri May 8 06:16:10 2015 UTC,"I have been looooving the Maybelline Dream Wonder Fluid-Touch foundation. I usually use the Estee Lauder Double Wear foundation (this mixed with a drop of argan oil has been my HG for the cooler weather!) for day to day but I've been wanting something lighter to wear on my days off. This is incredible! Lovely finish, evens my skin out, and wears well during the day. To be fair though, my only ""complaint"" is horrible genetic undereye circles - which I use a yellow corrector and MAC Prolongwear to cover - and some redness so YMMV. Colour match could be slightly better, but it looks fine with my powder over the top.  I also tried the Master Glaze blush stick in Just Pinched Pink (I believe) and it has become my go-to idiot proof blush. Blends easily and gives off a nice glow. I'm so happy with it, I've ordered the other colours I was interested in from Chemist Warehouse, so I'm excited curious to see how those are.  I've just about finished with the current primer I'm trying to use up (the normal one from Australis) and it's just not my favourite. I think it's a decent primer, but I definitely do prefer more siliconey feeling primers. If you have any recommendations, please let me know - no price limit :)"

So glad I did. It covers my acne scars amazingly without needing concealer but doesn't feel cakey and the Creamy Natural is such a good colour match for my neutral skin.  Australis AC ON TOUR Kit: I only really use two colours - the yellow to set my under-eye concealer and the middle contouring shade - but I love them and use them almost every day.   Hating:   Hourglass Mineral Veil Primer: I don't know what to say other than it does absolutely nothing for me. It doesn't smooth out my skin or make my makeup last longer or make it easier to put on. So many HG promises from everything I've read, so much disappointment! Australis Fresh & Flawless Pressed Powder: finally figured out what was making me have cystic break outs for the first time in years. It was this :("

AustralianMakeup,355vhk,pumpkinspicevodka,2,Fri May 8 05:21:14 2015 UTC,"No, thank goodness - I bought the small one. Still $25 though :( I don't actually hate it, to be fair. I just can't notice it doing a single thing and for the price I was really disappointed. Going to use it up for the sunscreen benefits, though."

Creamy and long lasting. I love to wear this underneath MAC's Twig lipstick * Essence maximum definition volume mascara. It has a slim silicone brush that is so easy to use. LOVE this! * Chi Chi baked eyeshadow in ""Livin' on a Prayer"". It is a cool-toned matte medium-brown that I use on my brows when I am after a softer look. Has great staying power and I love that I can use it on a damp brush to define the tails of my brows. * Stila ""Nouveau Natural"" eyeshadow palette. Lovely formula and I haven't really reached for any other palette since I purchased this in March      Loathing: * all of my Chi Chi eyeshadow palettes. I don't completely despise them, but they just pale in comparison to my Stila palette. I'll probably gift them to my younger cousin who is just starting to get into makeup. * Rimmel 16hr Provocalips in ""I'll Call You"". I like the colour in the tube and when I first apply it, but I'm not a fan of how the colour changes over time. I like how the other shades wear though :)"

The hype is REAL Wet n Wild Reserve your Cabana (Co-co-cobacabana) use this under foundation for radiant skin or as a finishing powder.  Loreal Blur cream, whatever it's called. Got a sample and really loved it, but now I have a MUFE primer. I know what I'll get once this one is finished though.   Not Liking:   Rimmel Fix and Perfect Primer. Does nothing for me whatsoever, except make orange patches on my skin if I'm not careful. Maybelline the falsies big eyes mascara. Thought the side for the top lashes would have the same brush as the falsies one. NOPE. Clump city. The bottom lashes side is great though."
AustralianMakeup,355vhk,rebcart,1 point,Sun May 10 23:33:52 2015 UTC,"I've got a serious love-hate relationship going with the Australis colour correcting palette thing.   I absolute ADORE the green colour corrector. I don't even need to put anything over it half the time, it just melds seamlessly into my skin and covers all the red (I seriously think I have green undertones because of this). It'll be completely used up before the other colours get any sort of dip in them.  On the other hand, I suspect the green colour corrector is what's causing my seriously oily nose issues on the few days that I actually wear makeup. Which is turning me into a rage monster, because it looks nasty and greasy and now I need to search for a new green to replace this one. Also the two yellow colours in the palette are too similar to each other, and too dark to be useful to me."
AustralianMakeup,355vhk,duneacha,4,Thu May 7 16:12:35 2015 UTC,"In addition to /u/damn-croissants' suggestion, MP make a green liquid concealer pen. I find it's just liquid enough to blend well, and thick enough to actually cover redness. To memory, i think it's around the $12 mark."
AustralianMakeup,355vhk,damn-croissants,1 point,Fri May 8 01:19:51 2015 UTC,i haven't actually tried it but maybelline make a green concealer stick. might be worth looking into?
AustralianMakeup,355vhk,criti_biti,2,Fri May 8 00:17:58 2015 UTC,I've got those Maybelline colour concealers and they're alright. The actual colour correcting works well but I found them kind of dry and difficult to work with. I either had to drag at my skin to place product or kind of stab my face with it. Might work better with a brush to place it.
AustralianMakeup,355vhk,afropowers_activate,1 point,Fri May 8 06:44:31 2015 UTC,"I've heard really good things about the Models Prefer green colour corrector, so you could always give that a go after the Australis one? :)"

Think I might have expected a bit too much. L2 box - little sample bottle of GlamGlow Powermud Dual Cleanser (15g), littler sample bottle of REN Instant Firming Beauty Shot (5mL), big sachet of Soap & Glory Righteous Butter (10mL), and little sachet of Josie Maran Argan Matchmaker Serum Foundation (0.5mL, light/medium).  I'm looking forward to trying the GlamGlow, but that's about it - I'm far more into makeup than skincare, and I don't particularly like foundation samples due to skintones and all that. Self-adjusting it says ... I don't trust it ..."
AustralianMakeup,355n8t,Artemisian11,2,Thu May 7 09:29:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah they can be pretty disappointing. I've had some great ones, and some truly shitty ones. And self adjusting... what a joke."
AustralianMakeup,355n8t,elfies_,3,Thu May 7 10:49:27 2015 UTC,"it's actually quite a good foundation if you don't expect coverage. it's self adjusting"" pretty much because it has very little coverage. but it's a really nice boost for the skin especially with the addition of argan oil in all her products :) so i'd say, it's not fabulous, but it's not a joke ahaha"
AustralianMakeup,355n8t,Artemisian11,1 point,Thu May 7 16:00:35 2015 UTC,"Good to hear! Most comments I've seen on the self-adjusting ones is that the colour ends up terrible, but hopefully this is better than that."

AustralianMakeup,355n8t,deluxecreampuff,1 point,Thu May 7 14:31:53 2015 UTC,"The problem is the size of the box.

AustralianMakeup,355n8t,Sleiphy,1 point,Thu May 7 23:22:10 2015 UTC,I'm only $75 from level three so am on the edge of buying $75 worth of stuff just to get a potentially better box. Anyone got a level 3 box that would like to list the contents?
AustralianMakeup,355n8t,pumpkinspicevodka,2,Fri May 8 02:09:35 2015 UTC,"Doesn't it freeze your level from a couple of weeks ago (16th April) when they paused accounts to review all the levels?

AustralianMakeup,355n8t,Sleiphy,1 point,Fri May 8 06:27:15 2015 UTC,Yes but my Mecca has previously given me the level up box when I was buying enough to get me over the line so I was hoping they'd be okay with it this time too.

AustralianMakeup,3520hv,damn-croissants,3,Wed May 6 23:07:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I've never used dipbrow so I couldn't compare, sorry! I honestly couldn't recommend it based on Jane's customer service, I know she is popular in general but our group order was just a massive cf and although she has other products I like, I won't be supporting LE in future. I think if you have a look on /r/IndieMakeupAndMore there are some comparisons though!!  Sorry I couldn't be more helpful!"
AustralianMakeup,3520hv,damn-croissants,2,Thu May 7 02:10:48 2015 UTC,"no, you were super helpful - thanks for the heads up re:customer service. to be honest that sort of thing is what puts me off buying more indies in general"
AustralianMakeup,3520hv,Jessijames,2,Thu May 7 02:33:43 2015 UTC,"I understand what you mean, there are definitely some great indie sellers though!! Feel free to PM me if you're ever unsure of a brand, I'd be happy to give you my honest opinion if I have tried them :)"
AustralianMakeup,3520hv,pondicus,2,Thu May 7 03:46:33 2015 UTC,"Inspired by /u/Jessijames - I haven't been using my makeup lately thanks to uni and being cooped up at home, but I decided to have a bit of a play today!  Products used:   Eccentric Cosmetics primer Too Faced Chocolate Bar palette Shiro Cosmetics You Know Nothing Life's Entropy Brow Theory in Ebony (massive thank you to /u/Laurensics) LORAC Pro mascara   In the final pics - there's also Australis primer and Rimmel Stay Matte BB cream (trying to use it up and experimenting with my application!) plus Blackbird Cosmetics Magic Trick violet powder  If the mascara looks a little clumpy, I find that it really is. I'm trying to finish it up though. Also if the liner looks a little patchy I found that the shadow was really hard to work with. I think I'll have to have a play and see how else I can use it. I definitely like the white liner look though!  Oh and edit to say - CCW of course, especially on the brows, I'm still learning how to use the brow theory!"
AustralianMakeup,3520hv,Jessijames,1 point,Wed May 6 13:22:03 2015 UTC,"Oooh yes!! I am loving that foiled liner but you're right about the patchiness. If it was more opaque it would look amazing! Would it layer up do you think?  & I'm glad you used the TF Choccie palette, I am trying to get more use out of it because atm I don't use it  enough to warrant keeping it and am debating selling it!"
AustralianMakeup,3520hv,pondicus,1 point,Thu May 7 03:45:17 2015 UTC,"That was with three layers! It's the first Shiro shadow I've had that has performed that badly, and it sucks cause it's actually quite pretty - it's got a subtle blue shift that doesn't show up well here - I may try a different way of foiling it and see if that helps :/  I think because it's my only neutral palette and it's new, I'm still in the honeymoon phase. I have to admit the novelty of the chocolate scent is kinda cool too haha"
AustralianMakeup,3520hv,pondicus,1 point,Thu May 7 03:56:50 2015 UTC,"Agreed with /u/Jessijames - much shame about the patchiness :(  I know a lot of people foil their liner with water or say, Darling Girl superstar serum - but I tend to use primer to do it. That helps the shadows to really stay on my lids, plus adds a bit of vibrancy - at least that's the results I get from my bottomless tube of Too Faced Shadow Insurance.   I still love my Chocolate Bar palette! Got it a year ago and while it's nowhere near as pigmented as my indie shadows, it's still trucking along. And it still smells like chocolate! Makes my morning eyeshadow routine so fun."

This began as a tutorial but I forgot to take half of the photos and got carried away so......My bad!  I have been thinking lately at how I own a few but never use purple shadows so I have been working on a some-what smokey look with them! I think you could easily deepen the crease/outer V with more black or even a deep gunmetal would look amazing! I didn't go that far because my housemates would probably freak out if they get home from work to me passed out on the couch with a full on smoky eye ha Even this is still pretty heavy for daytime!

Finishing Powder Too Faced Milk Chocolate Soleil Bronzer The Balm Mary-Lou Manizer MAC mineralize Blush in Just a Wisp ABH Dipbrow in Dark Brown   EYES + Worded Tutorial   MAC Paint Pot in Painterly as an all over base, once that is dried/set I lightly dusted 352 all over the lid up to the browbone to serve as a blending base. I buffed the top lightest shade in the 107R trio into the crease working it in up a little so it was super well blended (any light cool brown will do, this one is light enough that it doesn't look too dark on my complexion) with a fluffy crease brush, I used my Zoeva 227 which is a flatter fluffy brush. Using a flat shader (I used a Zoeva 234) pat shade 40 onto the outer third of the lid, then using the same brush pat 439 over the other 2/3rds starting from where it joins the 40 and stop just before the inner corner. I left a few mm between where the purple stopped and the middle of the crese so I wouldn't blend it up to high! Using the same fluffy blender brush, I gently started blending those purples up into the crease. I then grabbed a small amount of the 450 on a large pencil brush (Zoeva 231) and went over the outer third then went back over it with the original shade 40 - I found the red helped deepen and give that grey-purple a lot more depth! I grabbed a smaller pencil brush (Zoeva 230) to add a touch of the black 63 shade and re-blended with the same blending brush. Added a touch of the 160 which is a taupey purple-toned rose shade to the inner corner and dragged it a third of the way in on the lower lashline with the smaller pencil brush again. I grabbed some of the shade 40 to do the rest of the lower lash line. Tightlined with Urban Decay 24/7 Eye Pencil & on the lower waterline as well. Maybelline Master Precise felt tip liner for dat wing, and Too faced Better Than Sex mascara to finish!"

AustralianMakeup,350ykn,asteroyale,1 point,Wed May 6 05:15:41 2015 UTC,Is it normal for me to charge for the shipping within AUS? It will only be a couple of dollars I think
AustralianMakeup,350ykn,CarbonBeautyx,3,Wed May 6 05:21:51 2015 UTC,"I've done group orders before!  Usually how it works is you split up the shipping from the store between participants equally (or you can do it based on $ spent or weight) and then you also collect money to pay for postage from you to each person. Some people collect all the money at once, estimating the Australia Post part. However I prefer to collect the money for the order first, do the order, then when everything arrives I can package everything and weigh it, which means I can get an exact postage amount using AusPost's online calculator. I don't think I ever charged for packaging materials because I always had boxes/bubble wrap/envelopes/shredded paper lying around, but if you don't that's something else to consider as well.  If it were me, this is how I'd run it..   Announce orders open with a clear deadline After deadline, mock order to get shipping cost, split that by number of participants Send everyone totals (product+shipping split) in $US to be paid with paypal with clear deadline. Place order! Pay with your paypal balance in $US, no currency conversion issues! When it arrives, package each order and weigh/measure to calculate Australian shipping Collect shipping payment Post packages Done! (post lots of photos...lol)   If you have any more questions let me know!"

AustralianMakeup,350nwb,duneacha,8,Wed May 6 03:06:25 2015 UTC,"I bought a NAKED 2 fake knowingly from a market for shits & gigs, because I wanted to compare the quality to my real NAKED 1.  They were pigmented okay, the more shimmery shades were still fairly soft and performed alright but still didn't compare to the real thing! They were probably on par with those mediocre Maybelline/Revlon etc trios & quads, they were usable but not even worth the $20-30 I paid for it. I did use them on my eyes because I'm a risk-taker and wanted to really compare - they irritated them like CRAZY - they would be itchy and a little puffy and make my eyes/nose water after about an hour of wear. No permanent long-term damage from just a few wears but I tossed it soon after.  Interesting to note, that same stall (I believe it was in the Dandenong Markets) had a BUNCH of fake palettes from a ton of brands, not JUST UD or JUST NAKED palettes. This was probably 12+ months ago but they had fakes of the flushed & the basics palettes (I bought a flushed fake as well......shittest product I have ever used, zero pigment. 10/10 not worth it either), fakes of the popular Too Faced palettes, Stila fakes (I also bought a fake of the In The Light palette, about on par with the FAKED 2 and didn't compare to my Stila original) and fakes of some of the smaller quads from the lux brands too.   Some were more convincing than others packaging-wise, and I wish I was more into the whole reddit thing at that point and had documented my comparisons etc for a post but oh well!"
AustralianMakeup,350nwb,Jessijames,2,Wed May 6 03:42:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks! That's awful about the irritation. I wonder what ingredient caused that? Most of the products I saw were eye palettes, liners, pencils, mascara. A few blushes, and a few 'primers'. I don't remember seeing any foundations. It's incredibly irresponsible to sell dodgy/ potentially harmful products, and eyes are the LAST place they should be put. I didn't even consider that they would actually be irritating.  The ones I saw were all at the Carribean market in knox, so probably the same stallholder as Dandenong."
AustralianMakeup,350nwb,smilingsunbeams,2,Wed May 6 03:56:38 2015 UTC,"To be honest, as well as the potential irritation (it could be due to using a non-eye safe pigment in their mix which can cause serious damage), I'd be worried they weren't made to the same standards as big manufacturers, so you could well be putting contaminated products on your eyes, and an infection is not something I'd want to risk with my eye area!"
AustralianMakeup,350nwb,smilingsunbeams,2,Wed May 6 04:06:49 2015 UTC,"After reading a few lab test results on fakes, I'm picturing them being made in a big plastic vat on a dirt floor a la meth lab. :O"

AustralianMakeup,350nwb,ComingUpMilhouse,1 point,Wed May 6 04:13:35 2015 UTC,"It could be any number of ingredients, they could really put anything in those palettes they wanted no matter how harmful they could potentially be. My eyes aren't that sensitive either, I've never once had irritation from any other eye cosmetics I've ever used in my life so it was probably something awful.  Tests conducted on some FAKED palettes a few years ago IIRC (I am on mobile and can't find the article/blog atm) found them to have all sorts of nasty stuff in them have like arsenic and lead - in some cases human waste matter. It's a pretty big risk to take, but they're manufactured in all different places and some fakes likely may not even have those nasti(er) things in them.  & yeah, this place had liners and mascaras etc too but I didn't bother with those. It was the palettes I was most interested in testing & comparing! Wouldn't shock me if they were run by the same people."

AustralianMakeup,350nwb,peachfloyd,3,Wed May 6 11:48:29 2015 UTC,"I bought a bunch of fake MAC eyeshadows on eBay a few years ago. Mainly because I wanted a bunch of green eyeshadows to colour my face green, and it had the biggest selection of various green colours I could find for the price (I think from memory it was about $10 for about 30 eye shadows).  They were actually not too bad. I have pretty sensitive skin and I used the shadows all over my face with no irritation. The pigmentation and pay off was actually surprising for the price. I managed to get a full on bright green face (was going for the Elphaba from Wicked look) with enough shade variation for some contouring and depth. I put them over primer, had to do quite a few passes to get a bright colour but it was acceptable.  Obviously the packaging wasn't so great, I think a couple broke in transit too.  I probably wouldn't buy them again now, as I'm more strict about buying cruelty free makeup, but it was good at the time."

AustralianMakeup,34y7rk,smilingsunbeams,3,Tue May 5 15:30:16 2015 UTC,"I have both Chocolate Bars and all Nakeds, because I am compulsive and idiotic. The Nakeds are 100% more focused on the shimmer/glitter, and have much less colour range than the Bars - those are the main points of difference in my mind.  I can't comment on looks for older ladies - I'd think just go with what your mum likes/is comfortable with. If she likes shimmery shades, then go with the Naked! 1 and 2 are honestly quite similar - 1 is more gold/bronze and more sparkly, in my opinion. 2 is still shimmery, but it feels a bit more subdued. I personally think NC40 skin would be gorgeous with Naked 1 and it's golden shininess, but I don't have it myself so can't really verify that!  Also worth looking at the Semi-Sweet Chocolate Bar - I love it just as much as the original. Nice range of matte and shimmers, and a nice touch of colour to the range.  Any questions, let me know!"
AustralianMakeup,34y7rk,Artemisian11,1 point,Tue May 5 23:10:04 2015 UTC,"Haha I see it as spending money on your hobby, not idiotic at all! I have to be honest - the Chocolate Bar was a gift but I really appreciate it the addition to my collection so I can definitely understand picking up the other ones!  And thank you so much for a really helpful comparison. I spent ages on google images and finally just thought I'd ask here in case someone has both because it was really hard to tell. If you don't mind me bugging you a little more - do you get alot of fall-out with the Naked? I've seen some reviewers comment on this while other seem to think the formula is perfect."

Something with a better selection of matte shades would be more appropriate for someone out of their teens/early 20s. I'm 26, btw.  Have you considered a Lorac Pro pallet? This one will ship to Australia and will end up in your price range after shipping. I've been lusting after it for ages. Apparently much better quality than the UD and it's half mattes half shimmers."

I think I'll end up one of those grandmothers with pink hair and vibrant shadows haha.  I have to admit, I'm not wowed by the LORAC formula. Also when I had a palette ship from Amazon, the shadow came shattered :/ That palette does look really nice though, thank you for the suggestion! I'll have to do some googling I think!"
AustralianMakeup,34y7rk,ComingUpMilhouse,1 point,Wed May 6 05:58:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone can ever be too old for a bit of glitter and duochrome, it makes my makeup stand out better behind my glasses, but an entire eyeful of it can be too much. Glitter on the lid. Glitter in the crease. Glitter transition shade. Glitter highlight. Even black shadows have glitter now. Roll me in glitter and call it a day!  I admit that's one thing that's been putting me off ordering the Lorac, it's not like it can be easily returned. I know how to reset shadows but it wouldn't be the same. Which pallet did you get from Amazon?"
AustralianMakeup,34y7rk,ComingUpMilhouse,1 point,Wed May 6 06:14:24 2015 UTC,"Haha I see your point!  I can't remember exactly (and too lazy to look through my emails haha) but it was being offered around Black Friday last year and it was a Royal or something set with a shadow trio, liner, and mascara. It came rattling around in a huge box with no protection, so of course, it was all shattered. Since I've seen heaps of people online complaining about their Amazon stuff arriving in a similar condition, I don't think it was a one-off :/ (Also - the liner was all dried out and didn't even work!)  I don't mind repairing it and it's obviously still usuable. But since it's for a gift, I'd rather just get something I know will come in a good condition and not require a massive clean up job + losing some of the product you know?  It just sucks because that kind of colour range is exactly what I'm after!"
AustralianMakeup,34y7rk,pondicus,2,Wed May 6 06:22:56 2015 UTC,"I personally like the formula of Urban Decay eyeshadows better than Too Faced.

AustralianMakeup,34y7rk,pondicus,1 point,Wed May 6 05:16:41 2015 UTC,Ooh that's really helpful thank you! :) I think I may get her a Naked and a smaller Inglot palette so I get a good mix of neutrals and then a few bolder colours.

AustralianMakeup,34x2rs,smilingsunbeams,2,Tue May 5 07:31:48 2015 UTC,I've been a total hermit lately because my thesis is due extremely soon. But I spotted this on the Sportsgirl website! I would have grabbed it but I know their website colours can be a bit off sometimes - has anyone seen this in store and can confirm it's an actual grey? I may have to bribe a friend to grab one for me if so!
AustralianMakeup,34x2rs,xenomorphic_acid,2,Tue May 5 07:33:25 2015 UTC,"I saw that last night and wondered the same thing! I'm actually planning on going in to sportsgirl tomorrow to have a look at their makeup, if it's there I'll have a look and swatch it. (if they do testers, not sure?)"

If they don't, ask them, because they've always been super friendly when I've done that. I think they prefer people to swatch away with testers rather than risking people opening stuff without buying.   If you do see it please let me know!! I so almost made up a cart of $50, just to buy a lipstick I'm not even sure of the shade of :/ Sometimes my shopping compulsions are really bad."
AustralianMakeup,34x2rs,xenomorphic_acid,2,Tue May 5 08:07:48 2015 UTC,"Haha yeah I do the same thing too! I filled up my cart with 3 lipsticks last night and then realised this is silly, I've never even tried a Sportsgirl lipstick, just go in to the store. The store is 5 minutes from home, it's not like it's a massive trip!  Glad to hear they should have testers! The staff at my local store are pretty friendly, I've just never seriously looked at the makeup before so I can't remember if there were testers. :)"
AustralianMakeup,34x2rs,xenomorphic_acid,2,Tue May 5 08:16:26 2015 UTC,"Ooh what are the other shades you're interested in? If it helps, generally I love Sportsgirl's formula. The mattes can be on the drying side but their longevity is great and totally makes up for it. Also if they have a sale bin check it out, their summer shades will be like $3-5. I totally want Midnight but since I'm not 100% sold on the finish I may shamelessly be waiting for it to go on sale"
AustralianMakeup,34x2rs,xenomorphic_acid,1 point,Tue May 5 08:21:23 2015 UTC,"I don't mind drying, I have a bunch of liquid matte lipsticks which are way more drying than normal matte lipstick, and as long as I don't wear them every day my lips are alright. :)  I'm thinking about Whirlwind (looks like a muted lavender), Dark Angel (I love dark colours, this looks like a dark red), and maybe Love Bite if it isn't too similar to a NYX red I already have. Midnight looks tempting actually (I found a reddit post from a couple of months ago) I never thought I'd wear blue on my lips but I lot a dark navy blue from LA Splash and it's actually really pretty."

My first Sportsgirl lipstick and my mum and sister both got one after I did because it's the perfect dark red. It will cling to any dry patches though, so definitely exfoliate before wearing. And yeah I almost picked it up then! But I found it was quite shiny and not as pigmented as my other Sportsgirl colours so I wasn't totally sold on it.

AustralianMakeup,34x2rs,sarkata,2,Fri May 8 00:52:09 2015 UTC,Haha yep. STFU already and just tell me about what I came to see!!
AustralianMakeup,34x2rs,sarkata,2,Fri May 8 01:37:19 2015 UTC,"I swatched it and it's kinda similar to Macs cyber, a dark purple colour."
AustralianMakeup,34vqdf,xenomorphic_acid,6,Mon May 4 23:23:30 2015 UTC,"I almost didn't get this catalogue actually! It's really windy and raining here and I came out this morning to find wet junk mail scattered all over my driveway. I'm glad it's appreciated, thanks for saying so. :)"
AustralianMakeup,34vqdf,criti_biti,10,Tue May 5 02:33:14 2015 UTC,"Sale goes from 7th to the 13th of May. EDIT: some stores have already marked things down! thanks /u/criti_biti  This is why I don't buy these brands at full price.... The last target cosmetics sale was what, a month ago?  Missed a couple that were on another page...  Chi Chi is 30% off  Burt's Bees is 25% off, but I don't know how much makeup is stocked at Target."
AustralianMakeup,34vqdf,criti_biti,2,Tue May 5 02:56:02 2015 UTC,I was at a target yesterday and it was all on sale already. Might have just been that store but the tags were up and when I bought a Chi Chi palette it rang up as 30% off.

I'll just test out what I can and go home and order online. I need a new iron so I know for sure I'll go over the $40 threshold for click&collect, even if I only end up getting a couple of makeup things. :)"

As for the perpetual stock depletion issue with Target; that's the exact reason i rarely bother to pay attention to sales anymore. There is rarely the item i want in store. :("
AustralianMakeup,34vqdf,amyeh,2,Tue May 5 08:02:51 2015 UTC,"I see these posts and get so excited, then I realize I have to wait til Thursday before I can buy what I want.   Has anyone tried the NYX pressed powders perchance?"
AustralianMakeup,34vqdf,manicmoon,1 point,Tue May 5 04:26:36 2015 UTC,"Haha, yeah me too. :) I don't mind to much though, this way I can research a bit before buying. I'd like to think it cuts down on impulse buying, maybe!"
AustralianMakeup,34vqdf,muchmadeup,2,Mon May 4 23:29:55 2015 UTC,Anyone have any recommendations or anything they absolutely love from these ranges?  Was also wondering if any of these have decent primers? I've been using the NYX HD primer but I don't think its available in aus yet and I can't do an American order for a while..
AustralianMakeup,34vqdf,Rocha_999,2,Mon May 4 23:36:12 2015 UTC,The Rimmel Stay Matte primer is really good. Nothing fancy but it performs.
AustralianMakeup,34t2gg,NocturnalNightingale,2,Mon May 4 09:28:39 2015 UTC,"I have an Innoxa eyeshadow palette which is my favourite; so I would recommend grabbing one if they catch your fancy (regular price is $15, which might be a bit steep, but it's worth it). I have the daytime neutrals, which has a really pretty, shimmery gold, a dark brown, a light skin tone and kind of a mid beige tone? I find I don't need a primer, but ymmv."
AustralianMakeup,34t2gg,noidentifier,2,Mon May 4 09:47:42 2015 UTC,"Ooh thanks! The priceline I went too had a very small innoxa selection, I'm hoping the one at chadstone is bigger!"
AustralianMakeup,34t2gg,Sparkleworks,1 point,Mon May 4 10:45:36 2015 UTC,I love the Australis mascara. It magically works for me better than any others (no clumps or flakes) and it's dirt cheap!
AustralianMakeup,34t2gg,Sparkleworks,1 point,Mon May 4 12:30:53 2015 UTC,Thanks I'll give it a try! Most of my mascaras are very clumpy.
AustralianMakeup,34t2gg,WarlockPanda,1 point,Mon May 4 12:41:06 2015 UTC,"I think I have the waterproof. It's probably not as waterproof as some others I've used, but the general texture is nice on my eyelashes."
AustralianMakeup,34t2gg,Flippantry,1 point,Mon May 4 12:43:06 2015 UTC,"If you can find them, maybe try some disposable mascara wands for the Innoxa mascara. Usually when I have clumping, I find using a disposable wand stops clumping. However, it is a lot of effort for every day wear."
AustralianMakeup,34trwe,katycups,4,Mon May 4 14:27:28 2015 UTC,NARS Tinted moisturiser is the bomb for dry skin.
AustralianMakeup,34trwe,breviloquent-,1 point,Mon May 4 18:21:07 2015 UTC,Seconding that! Also has pretty decent colour range so you should be able to get matched pretty well ☺
AustralianMakeup,34trwe,Bedders_95,2,Tue May 5 08:32:07 2015 UTC,"I like olay fresh effects bb for a really sheer finish (practically tinted moisturizer) because its just easy to apply and feels nice on the skin and evens everything out a bit. For something with medium coverage I love missha perfect cover bb. It looks grey toned but melts into skin so nicely and covers redness quite well. I also like the chi chi bb cream, it smells good but its fairly expensive and the lightest colour is quite yellow. Its not too noticeable when you blend it in but if you're super pink it might look off. I have dry skin and also find a nice layer of moisturiser never hurts :) I also like the foa primer in the purple tube for a moisturising primer that smooths skin out a bit. Aaaaand thats probably enough moisture for anyone's face hahah! Hope this helps"
AustralianMakeup,34trwe,freezethefire,2,Mon May 4 15:23:09 2015 UTC,"I really like the MAC BB cream (in the tube) for my everyday light coverage look. It's pretty nice especially when applied with the real techniques damp sponge on my dry skin. It's pink toned (I think) and I am roughly the same shade as you and use the shade ""light plus""."
AustralianMakeup,34trwe,blitzen25,1 point,Mon May 4 22:59:00 2015 UTC,I think I'm on my 4th tube of this - it's fantastic for dry and pink skin. I use light and I'm around a nw10-15.
AustralianMakeup,34trwe,ArrghUrrgh,2,Wed May 6 02:52:14 2015 UTC,"Have you tried any of the Skin79 (Korean brand) ones? I've given these samples a go and I quite like the staying power, and from what I've seen they're pretty good at adjusting to your skin tone (though they do look a little too pale - on me at least - for like, 2-5 minutes after application). I reckon they're worth a try, and might save you some cash if they do suit your needs :)"
AustralianMakeup,34trwe,ghostlighghts,2,Tue May 5 10:07:34 2015 UTC,"I've got a similar skin tone and situation when it comes to dryness or patchiness and picked up NYX BB cream in Nude (which applied neutral on me) and since using it, haven't even really touched my Skinbase foundation at all.  I use LUSH's Skin Drink moisturiser most days instead of primer, and unless you mix it with another foundation, the coverage holds strong and lasts a usual 9-5 shift."
AustralianMakeup,34trwe,batdee,1 point,Thu May 7 09:27:43 2015 UTC,"Seconding nyx! I've been super impressed with a lot of their products, even on my incredibly dry, uneven skin. I use their BB in their lightest shade, it's the first really neutral shade I've found. I set it with their transparent setting powder,I'm not sure what it's called. No flakey patches and stays all day!"
AustralianMakeup,34trwe,digitalcatbox,2,Sun May 10 10:10:02 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit late to the party, and my rec is a CC cream rather than a BB cream, but my skin is about the same as your (NW15-20ish, tending to dryness), and I've been loving Models Prefer CC cream in Light. I'd say the coverage is medium, and it feels very moisturising.  Edit: I should mention it does say on the tube it 'helps control oil' but I don't find it drying in the slightest."
AustralianMakeup,34trwe,teapottersparty,2,Thu May 7 12:47:43 2015 UTC,"When I am feeling particularly dry, I put a drop of face oil in my foundation/tinted moisturiser. I am currently using Face Hero by Go-To, and just one drop of that mixed into my Bourjois Healthy Mix serum this morning has made my skin feel good.  That being said, I am not a super-dry-skinned girl, so it might not be enough for you, but I thought it might be a good place to start instead of buying a new product."
AustralianMakeup,34trwe,amyeh,2,Fri May 8 00:56:36 2015 UTC,Good to know- I might try that with my leftover Garnier!
AustralianMakeup,34sfs6,mmmonroe,4,Mon May 4 04:08:23 2015 UTC,"Welcome!!   Okay so sticking with a familiar colour scheme, I think dark red lips look good on pretty much everyone. One of the best Aussie lip products for their price are the Sportsgirl lipsticks IMO and Dark Angel is a really nice wintery dark red colour! They've got a similar shade called Bitten which has some shimmer and is really pretty. I'd recommend heading to Sportsgirl and just swatching some of their lipsticks, they've got some really cute shades out at the moment and they've always got testers out which is super handy.   The new Velourlips colours like Buda-Pash and Doo-Bai are also darker reds - some people have said Buda-Pash can be quite patchy - I've had good experiences with it but be aware of that!   Other colours - I like browns for this time of year and I noticed Shanghai Suzy's new range has a 90s type brown in it but I can't quite remember the name.   I'll update if I think of any more!"
AustralianMakeup,34sfs6,smilingsunbeams,2,Mon May 4 04:18:09 2015 UTC,"Ooh, thank you! I'll definitely check out Sportsgirl! I have the Velourlips in NY-CEE and honestly I'm such a n00b at applying that thing haha.  Thanks for the recs, I shall check them out!"
AustralianMakeup,34sfs6,criti_biti,1 point,Mon May 4 04:24:12 2015 UTC,"Thin layers! If you find it pills up weird and rubs off, apply it in really thin layers with a brush and try not to let it dry in between. Usually reapplying wet product over dry makes it sit weird. They are a bit fiddly."
AustralianMakeup,34sfs6,smilingsunbeams,1 point,Mon May 4 04:25:30 2015 UTC,"Oh thanks! Yeah I definitely need to get myself a lip brush, it seems like the only way to make sure I don't end up looking like a 3 year old who got into mums makeup"
AustralianMakeup,34sfs6,criti_biti,1 point,Mon May 4 04:29:23 2015 UTC,"I actually find the opposite - I make sure the bottom layer is completely dry. I think the newer Velourlips are less prone to crumbling so maybe this isn't the case with the older ones though. Also if you're grabbing a lip brush, my super secret lip is to grab an angled brow brush instead. The angle lets you get around the cupids bow and line your lips super precisely. The other option is to touch up around your lips with a nude liner. I love NYX's Wonder Pencil for this but they do only come in 3 shades!"
AustralianMakeup,34sfs6,lush1984,1 point,Mon May 4 04:33:43 2015 UTC,"What's your colouring? I'm quite pale with med-dark hair, so I try to avoid really dark colours and go for either brighter or muted versions of the typical autumn colours.   Oxblood, dark plum/berries, muted red, KVD lolita (muted dusty rose?) are all autumn colours in my mind. Orange and brown too, if they work with your colouring. For winter I think of purer colours, rich red, plum/berry/fuschia colours, nude, pale pink.   My favourite autumn lipstick will always be LÓreal Colour Riche Intense Plum, even though it's a lot darker than what I, personally, would normally wear. I try to avoid mattes too, because I find they dry my lips out, with the cold dry air and all."
AustralianMakeup,34sfs6,WarlockPanda,1 point,Mon May 4 04:24:26 2015 UTC,"I'm a pale-olive with med-dark hair, I usually wear Besame's Red Hot Red or MAC Russian Red and they seem to suit me ok (as far as I can tell - I'm no expert!)  I think a dark plum would be lovely, not 100% sure about brown but that might just be due to bad past experiences haha. I'll have a look for the Loreal one too, thank you :)"
AustralianMakeup,34sfs6,lush1984,3,Mon May 4 04:28:19 2015 UTC,Sports girl do a lovely plum lipstick called Bitten and a dark blackened red called dark angel that I'm in love with.   This is bitten; http://imgur.com/pDMr57z

AustralianMakeup,34sfs6,elfies_,1 point,Tue May 5 00:44:20 2015 UTC,"Could you wear a purple? I sound like the same colouring as you and my go-to colour is always a purple (MAC Heroine or Shanghai Suzy Miss Ally Amethyst). I tend to wear it more over Autumn and Winter, and with my colouring they dont look too purple.  But dark plums are always a good idea! Or oxblood colours. Mmmm. This is basically my whole lip product collection right here, really dark lipsticks or insanely bright pinks."

AustralianMakeup,34oxr0,eood,3,Sun May 3 05:16:24 2015 UTC,I've been really impressed by L'Oreal True Match. My concealer stick hasn't been getting as much use.
AustralianMakeup,34oxr0,LeahBrahms,3,Sun May 3 09:01:48 2015 UTC,"I really like true match, but I do find that it's quite heavy, which is a good thing for pictures and going out out but casual wear it's a bit too much for me personally, as I break out quite easily, which is why I have my bare minerals handy for when I want a lighter day or to let my skin breathe a bit :)"
AustralianMakeup,34oxr0,Artemisian11,2,Sun May 3 10:14:06 2015 UTC,"Good call on the Provocalips - Make Your Move is now one of my favorite lippies. Just stays forever, not even slightly sticky, and such pretty subtle sparkle!"
AustralianMakeup,34oxr0,Artemisian11,3,Sun May 3 09:28:20 2015 UTC,"I love them! The only thing I find is that it peels from the inside of my lips, from where they get wet I guess. Apart from that the staying power is great. And I love the option of matte or glossy"
AustralianMakeup,34oxr0,SquiddyTheMouse,1 point,Sun May 3 10:14:58 2015 UTC,"I haven't had that peeling thing, but I am pretty bad at lipstick application and probably just don't go far enough inside. I put on the gloss thing a few times, but ... it doesn't really add anything? The matte looks just fiiiiiiiiiine."
AustralianMakeup,34oxr0,SquiddyTheMouse,1 point,Sun May 3 12:17:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah I love the matte. And my boyfriend won't kiss glossy lips, so the kiss proof is a definite favourite :)"
AustralianMakeup,34oxr0,SquiddyTheMouse,1 point,Sun May 3 12:26:58 2015 UTC,Just checked out the online catalogue and saw that it's only until the 11th :(  If it was until the 15th I'd be able to get it.
AustralianMakeup,34oxr0,SquiddyTheMouse,2,Sun May 3 11:54:09 2015 UTC,Aww that's a shame :( I went to Priceline today and my bag was the 2nd to last one... This was in Melbourne cbd though. I don't know if they'll have more deliveries or something or if they made them up in store.
AustralianMakeup,34oxr0,SquiddyTheMouse,2,Sun May 3 12:27:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if they do restock the gifts, because there's always a disclaimer saying ""While stocks last"". I'm pretty sure the stores are sent a set amount of gifts, then told to deal with the angry women (and sometimes men) that didn't get in quick enough.  I mostly want the gift because the little bag that it comes with looks really nice :D Is it any different from the picture in the catalogue? It looks matte in the catalogue, but shiny in your photo. I also wanted it because it comes with a lot of stuff that I'd actually use. They usually come with stuff I have no use for, like little samples of anti-wrinkle cream. I'm 18 for fuck sake, I don't need anti-wrinkle cream. But they invariably give me foundation/bb cream samples 4 shades too dark :( They should let you pick which sample you want, or have a ""build your own gift"" with the items available, but you get to choose what colour you want."
AustralianMakeup,34oxr0,Artemisian11,2,Sun May 3 12:34:54 2015 UTC,"The bag is very shiny and glossy, I'd say it's kinda styled to look like a Ted Baker bag. It's pretty big too, I was expecting something a lot smaller. So I was pleasantly surprised.   Well I only just moved to Australia but I think it's an amazing deal! There are only a couple of products I honestly won't use, and I only brought very basic make up with me so it's nice to have a bit of a collection again!   I agree with the build your gift thing, that would be cool 😎"

AustralianMakeup,34oxr0,SquiddyTheMouse,2,Sun May 3 12:47:48 2015 UTC,"Oh cool I'll check it out, thanks!   Not too much different actually. $2 is about £1 so I just halve everything to compare it and it's really not any more expensive. I've only shopped in Priceline for make up and I'm pretty happy with the prices :)   The only thing is that I'm still used to single figures for things, for example a lipstick in the UK would be like £6 but here it's $12 and it makes me wince because it seems like so much more lol.  I'm slowly adjusting!"
AustralianMakeup,34oxr0,redkoala,1 point,Sun May 3 13:03:21 2015 UTC,"I only shop at Priceline. Mostly because it's the only make up retailer in my area, but also because they've got the best prices I've been able to find.  I want to go to America, stock up on make up, then come back to Australia. Make up is so much cheaper in America."
AustralianMakeup,34oxr0,SquiddyTheMouse,1 point,Sun May 3 13:10:55 2015 UTC,"Really? I guess I'm just used to the prices. I'm strictly a high street make up buyer, I don't own any designer make up. But I'm feel there's a great choice on the high street and I know which brands I like and trust.   The only thing I really begrudge buying is Bare Minerals. I used to order mine on eBay in the UK. In shops it was £20+ but on eBay it was less than £10 and genuine. It's a good product but such a rip off!"

AustralianMakeup,34pnwv,Artemisian11,2,Sun May 3 23:23:07 2015 UTC,"Too thick for creasing! I think the only way I'll know is if I just get one and see.

I find it easiest using a flat brush to pick up a small amount of product and press it onto the lid. You don't want to try applying these with a fluffy brush - it just doesn't work very well and is kinda messy.   I think you would definitely get shifting/creasing if using without a primer, unless you have dry lids (mine are mega oily). But with a decent eyeshadow primer (I use NARS Smudgeproof) they are fine.   As for how long they last, I'm not sure. I've worn Jay Zed for about five hours with no issues. Again, I think this would depend on your primer."

AustralianMakeup,34pnwv,deadlypony,2,Mon May 4 23:51:24 2015 UTC,"They are super creamy,and kinda remind me of the Stila Magnificent Metals shadows. I've got the Bronzonce one (I think it was limited edition, not 100% sure though) and I use it on nights out and sometimes, very rarely during the day for work. They work really well, however I do recommend you use some kind of primer or a base so they don't crease. Also I found they apply the best with fingers rather than a brush because they're so creamy/ wet."
AustralianMakeup,34pnwv,fuzzboo,2,Mon May 4 02:32:35 2015 UTC,I think I remember reading that Gold Gaga is just Bronzonce renamed? Could be wrong though.
AustralianMakeup,34pnwv,fuzzboo,2,Mon May 4 02:39:52 2015 UTC,I just found it on their website its a bit of a rose gold/ coppery type of colour!

Some counters don't even have pots, so you can always bring your own just in case, but they might say no.  In any case, it's worth asking."

AustralianMakeup,34m9od,oldhaunts_,2,Sat May 2 13:47:34 2015 UTC,Think it depends on the mood of the SA sometimes. Always helps if you buy something else too but I don't plan on doing that.

Some of the matte shades don't seem to be super great but that's not really a price issue since I think a lot of mid or even higher end palettes can have some lacklustre mattes.

Interesting thing to bring up though, I'd never really thought about it!"
AustralianMakeup,34lp8e,Flippantry,2,Sat May 2 14:14:18 2015 UTC,"I don't normally blend my foundation down my neck, so I only ever really do it if I have excess primer or if my neck is feeling dry or something.

AustralianMakeup,34l345,firsttimemidwife,1 point,Sat May 2 03:11:47 2015 UTC,I liked the Nyx pencil but didn't repurchase because the tip is quit thick. It's quite hard to get a precise line. Good in a pinch though.

They really listen to you and what you want and can really choose the best products because they have a wide range to choose from. I've found MAC are often out of stock of many colours
AustralianMakeup,34l5fy,drunkerxx,1 point,Sat May 2 04:03:58 2015 UTC,That's great to hear because I booked in with them today! :D thanks
AustralianMakeup,34l5fy,elfies_,3,Tue May 5 14:41:57 2015 UTC,"I live on the GC and spend more time at Mecca than I would like to admit. I have always found their staff to be super helpful and lovely, and like others have said, they have access to a wider range of brands etc. The MAC counter at David Jones is decent, but half the time I feel like the employees there are more concerned with having conversations between themselves than actually giving me a hand. If you're set on MAC, I find the counter at Pacific Fair in Broadbeach is generally better. Just my experience though, your mileage may vary!  Congrats on your 21st!"
AustralianMakeup,34ic38,Artemisian11,7,Fri May 1 12:10:45 2015 UTC,"That sucks :(  Now that you're stuck with it, could you try mixing with a slightly darker foundation? Otherwise maybe someone would be interested in purchasing from /r/aussiemakeupexchange and you can at least get some of the funds back and try again with a better matched shade?"
AustralianMakeup,34ic38,smilingsunbeams,0,Fri May 1 12:54:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, exchange is probably what I was thinking! All my friends are much paler, so no chance I know anyone who'd want it :("
AustralianMakeup,34ic38,smilingsunbeams,1 point,Fri May 1 13:26:36 2015 UTC,"I thought of that, but I got it through the Myer MAC counter, and their policy says no refunds? it was a fair while ago, and it's been niggling me that people I see saying they're an NC20 look decidedly fairer than me, but only just looked into it properly.  I might go to the proper MAC store that's now near me and get re-matched, and if it is definitely wrong, go with the /r/aussiemakeupexchange/ option."
AustralianMakeup,34ic38,smilingsunbeams,2,Fri May 1 13:21:03 2015 UTC,"Just to butt in, I would say it wouldn't hurt to speak to the proper MAC store. If you explain the situation they might be willing to help? Honestly most times I've found if I'm calm and speak to people like they're actually people, they're way more likely to try their hardest to help you get what you want. I think coming from a cs background where I know I was the same, if you have a sane customer who isn't screaming at you unreasonably and treating you with respect, you can sympathise alot easier and maybe even help them find the loophole or whatever it is they need to get their outcome :)"
AustralianMakeup,34ic38,compactgirlfriend,1 point,Fri May 1 13:26:16 2015 UTC,"I've worked in various forms of CS for nine years, so yes, I know all about being a rational customer :P Sometimes I almost feel it works against me - if someone says that can't grant my request because of rules/procedure/whatever I never push, don't want to ruin anyone's day! I'll be giving it a shot, will see how it goes."
AustralianMakeup,34ic38,Satanasaur,2,Fri May 1 13:46:48 2015 UTC,"Haha sorry I hope I didn't seem condescending, I just find it isn't generally common sense that people in cs positions should be treated nicely instead of yelled at to get what you want :/  Good luck with it, I hope they can help you out!!"
AustralianMakeup,34ic38,Tuipie,2,Fri May 1 15:34:00 2015 UTC,I was in this exact situation!!!! I had only used the colour like 5 times. I went back to the store with a receipt and no box and asked them if they could exchange it. It was like 7 months after I bought it and they let me. You should definitely try :)
AustralianMakeup,34ic38,byggie,1 point,Fri May 1 15:54:29 2015 UTC,"Oh, awesome!! Might chat to them this weekend then."
AustralianMakeup,34ic38,byggie,1 point,Fri May 1 13:49:05 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest going in, as I have been colour matched incorrectly before, and went back in a month later (I was on holidays, which I explained to them) and they were happy to do another colour match for me and refund the product, as I had only used it once before realising it was way too pink for me. This was at one of the Myer Mac counters, so I really would suggest at least giving it a try!"

My friend has also noticed the same flashback, I have no idea why. When did you buy your bottle? Maybe its a formulation thing?"
AustralianMakeup,34gqok,yolington,1 point,Fri May 1 14:17:52 2015 UTC,"I'm a very oily skin girl, and I use The Body Shop instablur primer for my forehead, nose, sides of my nose (where my big pores are), my upper lip area, and my chin.   Then I mix the Revlon Colorstay combination/oily and the Covergirl outlast stay fabulous foundation. I used to just use the revlon Colorstay by itself and it's good, but when I combine these 2 foundations together, they last sooo much longer. When the oils does seep through within 8 hours or so, it looks dewy than greasy. But whenever its dewy and I still want a matte look, I use the Etude House zero sebum drying powder, and from my experience it is more effective if you already have an dewy or oily face, and this powder is a God sent. It's not cakey when applied, and it's translucent."

AustralianMakeup,34gqok,yolington,1 point,Fri May 1 12:38:24 2015 UTC,"Yes! The bodyshop Instablur primer is actually the best primer I've tried so far and my HG. It's not silicone-y nor liquidy/moisturising/greasy. I honestly think it's perfect for oily skin. I do use this over my moisturiser (Neutrogena hydro Boost - my HG moisturiser) and sometimes without moisturiser and just the primer alone, there's no significant difference.   I've tried the Essence all about matt primer, Maybelline age rewind primer, Face of Australia face base primer (I heard it was a SmashBox dupe), Garnier perfect blur 5 second primer, Etude house baby skin base, and a sample of the hourglass primer. But none of these primers come close to my HG.   But I've yet to try that new Maxfactor primer though, I've heard good reviews from them but I don't know if it's good for oily skin?"

Everything else is full size I think, or close enough that I can't tell the difference (the L'oreal polish maybe? It's only 5mL, but still sizable)."

AustralianMakeup,34dqat,smilingsunbeams,4,Thu Apr 30 12:15:47 2015 UTC,"I think Kmart must be slowly switching out some name brands for house brands? Maybe to keep it cheap? (Like Aldi).   Not related to cosmetics, but not that long ago you used to be able to buy name brand earphones there (like Phillips and brands like that). I went into my local Kmart about a month ago and they only had like house brand ones (which I found very disappointing because I have a preference lol)."

AustralianMakeup,34dgd0,fire--starter,26,Thu Apr 30 06:53:47 2015 UTC,"I used to work at Priceline and I have to say the management, not just the store, but the company overall, was extremely poor. The customer service of head office was so poor, nobody was trained properly and people didn't even pick up the phone with a proper greeting. I had a girl come in with the same problem and she was absolutely devastated since she'd ordered quite a bit during the 40% off cosmetics sale and she was trying to remember what she ordered so she could buy it in store instead. We weren't able to offer her the matched 40% off price that she was supposed to get and management didn't do anything about it either. She wasn't too fussed about paying extra but I just felt that the company had utterly failed any customer service claim they have ever made."
AustralianMakeup,34dgd0,elfies_,11,Thu Apr 30 07:12:32 2015 UTC,"I applied for a job at Priceline a while back, the interview went really well, but in the end I didn't get the job because I was ""too experienced"" and the lady hiring said she thought I would get bored. I was really pissed off about it for ages but hearing this makes me glad I wasn't hired and maybe I dodged a bullet…"
AustralianMakeup,34dgd0,reddit-g,6,Thu Apr 30 21:37:47 2015 UTC,"I have had so many interviews like that because I have university degrees. If I wanted to do what I was qualified for, I'd be doing it! I know what I applied for here, I'm a big girl."
AustralianMakeup,34dgd0,magickmidget,2,Fri May 1 02:23:57 2015 UTC,"Right?! It really bothered me because in the interview I sounded like exactly what they wanted and even she said that herself… Her saying I'd get bored bothered me, I wouldn't have applied for the job if I thought that. And isn't that for me to decide?! ANYWAY! As they sing in Frozen, let it go! Let it go!"
AustralianMakeup,34dgd0,reddit-g,6,Fri May 1 08:40:08 2015 UTC,"I've had lots of issues with Priceline's customer service :( Namely in regards to Sister Club vouchers. I pretty much buy all my beauty products, medical needs and prescriptions (which I know aren't counted toward your point tally) from Priceline however  I have only received a couple of vouchers over the past 7 or so years.   I once facebook messaged the page and was told to call/email instead. I have emailed a few times and zero response. Not even an acknowledgement that they are looking into it.   When I log in to my account, I can see that I have unused (now expired) vouchers and I haven't received any in ages despite spending enough money over the last couple of quarters.  They definitely need to step up their game in regards to customer service and satisfaction."
AustralianMakeup,34dgd0,Faith333,2,Thu Apr 30 12:46:45 2015 UTC,"that's honestly abysmal, when i worked there i did the best i could to help anyone i could. the staff in store should've been able to check in the system if you'd updated your address and offered to call customer service right then and there.    i hated admitting it but my worst customer service experience ever was actually a phone call to the new priceline store in the galleries sydney, i was after a perfume and after they'd transferred my call the woman who picked up said ""hello"" like she was bored out of her mind and then proceeded to say ""hello, who is this"", and mustering up all my self control not to berate her i asked for chloe signature perfume you know, the one everyone loves and is always bloody sold out, and her response was ""nah i dont think we got that one"", took so much self control for me not to ask for her manager and clip his ear for hiring such shit staff"
AustralianMakeup,34dgd0,elfies_,3,Thu Apr 30 14:56:36 2015 UTC,"I had an experience a few months ago where I bought the Manicare Gel Nails System Kit from Priceline, but one of the bottles inside was actually empty. I understand that it is not Priceline's fault - they shouldn't have to look inside every box, but it was more the way that they handled it that was upsetting.  The closest store to me is about 25-30 minutes away, so when I got home I decided to call up rather than go back in. When I called the store and explained what happened, the lady on the phone seemed polite and she said that if I came back in she would replace the set for me. When I went to ask her name she spoke over the top of me and then hung up. I decided to drive back to the store and when I explained it to the lady at the front counter she asked who I spoke to and I said I had no idea because she did not tell me her name. She agreed to replace it as I had my receipt with me.  I then went home, opened up the box and realised that she had put the wrong box back in my bag (I knew that it wasn't the other one because she opened it to double check that the bottles were full). So I called up again and the person said to come back in. I was so mad at this point because I had already wasted an hour of my day going back already, but I figured that I'd come this far, why stop now.  When I got there, I explained what had happened to the gentleman at the counter. He was really nice and I could tell he was good with customers but they didn't really offer me anything for the inconvenience. I explained that I had gone there three times today and the distance it takes me to travel but there was no real apology or anything shown.  I work in customer service, and I rarely call up and complain but when I do I'm always polite because I know the feels when an angry customer calls up and they're rude; it can really ruin your day. I wasn't expecting my cash back or anything, but maybe an actual apology would have been nice..."

AustralianMakeup,34dgd0,itwaswonderful,8,Fri May 1 05:49:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's a big pain. I ordered some stuff in the 40% off sale but then got an email saying the products weren't able to be shipped - but this was after the 40% off period had ended! And everything that was refunded wasn't a new product, it was me buying a replacement for a used up product! So I had to buy it for full price. Made me really annoyed."
AustralianMakeup,34dgd0,assaulted_peanuts,5,Thu Apr 30 07:40:23 2015 UTC,I've also had that happen a couple of times but the thing that really irritates me is that they take so long to post it.

Shopmissa is pretty cool though! some of the quality is hit and miss, but the majority of the stuff i got was great! and considering everything is a dollar each, including things like e.l.f products, it's worth the risk"
AustralianMakeup,34dgd0,elfies_,1 point,Thu Apr 30 11:45:19 2015 UTC,"I've not heard of shopmissa.com, this is dangerous!  $10.95 for international shipping is quite reasonable too..."

I  got e.l.f brushes, falsies, socks, a head band, earrings,butterfly clips, a scarf and a bracelet.  The e.l.f brushes, falsies, socks earrings, butterfly clips and scarf were all good. the head band and the bracelet look visibly cheap though. the earrings were hypo-allergenic!  and the clips are so cute and look really good quality.  the brushes go for about 3 dollars each, according to elf's own website, and when you're buying earrings at like big w, louisa etc, you're paying up to 20 bucks, and they're not hypo-allergenic. so I really think it's worth it.  so I don't mind having one or two misses in an order, when it's a dollar each."
AustralianMakeup,34dgd0,amyeh,9,Fri May 1 03:41:33 2015 UTC,"Have also had this same experience actually.  Only had a small part of my order fulfilled - and the part that WAS was a Maybelline Colour Tattoo that was covered in  gunk.  When I took the product into the store to ask to exchange it, the girl told me ""it's just on the outside - so who cares?"" and then after telling her I didn't feel comfortable using a product that was not only dirty but had it's label missing she literally walked over to the shelf, put MINE up on the shelf and handed me a different one with the comment ""Not everyone is as picky as you about a totally sealed product"".  I was actually disgusted.  (To be fair, she was correct. The product for all intents and purposes was still very much sealed. It just wasn't the brand new product I'd paid for.)"

AustralianMakeup,34ep6r,Jessijames,3,Thu Apr 30 16:22:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's my point! Does anyone really get stuff from there, especially when it's priced pretty close to how much I would pay from the shop directly, making the risk you take pretty much not really worth it?

AustralianMakeup,34e6qj,assaulted_peanuts,1 point,Thu Apr 30 23:05:57 2015 UTC,You can also tick which brands you want it to display. I do that when I want to know roughly what colour I will be in a certain foundation I have seen reviewed online
AustralianMakeup,34e6qj,amyeh,3,Fri May 1 01:44:48 2015 UTC,"As another pale girl (albeit with warm undertones) I can't recommend Illamasqua Skin Base in shade 01 white enough!  It allows me to lighten my existing foundations to suit my face, but I don't have to lose any coverage. It doesn't take up any extra time to mix it with your foundation each morning as you no longer have to blend so far down your neck now that your foundation matches! I've had my bottle for 1.5 years now and I've barely used a quarter with daily use. However, I have found that it can cause flashback in photos as the flash tends to pick up on the white pigment.  I'm not sure if it would be light enough but Rimmel tend to offer their lightest shades with pink undertones - the Match Perfection and Lasting Finish 24 hour foundations have pink undertones in the lightest shades if I remember correctly.   Hope this has helped :)"
AustralianMakeup,34e6qj,mustuseallthegifs,2,Thu Apr 30 16:47:35 2015 UTC,I also have Illamasqua in White to mix in with my foundation if it is too dark (generally during winter months).

AustralianMakeup,34e6qj,sydneysomething,2,Fri May 1 03:01:34 2015 UTC,"Okay so this is my only area of expertise as a person interested in make up. I wear mont blanc too for reference although its a touch too dark but whatever, you blend it down your neck, scowl inwardly and deal.   The closest matches ive found straight out of a bottle are the missha bb cream in shade 13 bright beige and illamasqua foundations in the white with pink undertones option (i can't recall the actual number as its rubbed off my bottle but i think its rf02 or something along those lines.) Illamasqua however is expensive so missha would be the way to go probably.   There seems to be a thing with make up lines that the brands that offer lighter shades than most others all run really yellow (I'm looking at you Nars and Bobbi Brown)."
AustralianMakeup,34e6qj,magickmidget,2,Thu Apr 30 14:27:36 2015 UTC,"I refer to this thread by /u/rebcart.

AustralianMakeup,34e6qj,The_Sick,1 point,Sun May 3 04:17:34 2015 UTC,Dude! Mont Blanc fair lady here. Go and try out Natio Pure Mineral Foundation in the shade light or light medium (I am the latter so I would assume you are too). You can pick it up from Priceline or other pharmacies. It's $20
AustralianMakeup,34e6qj,Kirena,1 point,Fri May 1 07:56:59 2015 UTC,"I love the ChiChi BB Cream in Light, a half pump applied with a stippling brush covers my whole face without caking or streaking. Great for days where I just want a more even skin tone. It smells really nice and is very neutral. Use this most days.  I also really like Kat von D Tattoo Lock It in Light 44 (which has beige undertones) as a more full coverage look, but I also sometimes mix a bit of moisturiser in to thin it out. This does have a reputation for oxidation but I use Napoleon Perdis Autopilot Primer and have never had that problem. This shade is a perfect match for me.  The NP Stroke of Genius Cashmere Foundation has a really nice finish and is full coverage as well, but the shade range is really limited. The lightest sometimes looks a little dark on me, so I mix a little of my lighter foundation in to help.  You can also use findation.com to find similar foundations or what your color would be in a different range. Very helpful, it helped me work out which brand carried shades that suited my skin and weren't too yellow or pink."
AustralianMakeup,34e6qj,madefromrain,1 point,Thu Apr 30 13:14:03 2015 UTC,"Chi Chi BB cream would be wayyyy too dark and yellow, but the cc cream in fair might match ok. Also Revlon Colorstay in Ivory."
AustralianMakeup,34e6qj,Iucrezia,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:37:39 2015 UTC,I use Mont Blanc and find the Chi Chi CC cream in light to be a perfect match. Like my skin but better. Fair is a touch too pale for me.

AustralianMakeup,34d52m,amyeh,6,Thu Apr 30 04:44:17 2015 UTC,"I LOOVE Savvy Classic Blushes, and I think the one in ""Plum"" may be what you're looking for.  It's only $5, and they're some of the best I've ever tried.  Longlasting, easy to use, super pigmented.  It's best to start small and work your way up with these ones, because it's far too easy to get accidental clown cheeks.  But, I've been using them for about 3 years now, and absolutely sweaaaar by them."
AustralianMakeup,34d52m,jamballdonut,3,Thu Apr 30 05:25:57 2015 UTC,"Second this, I think Savvy has some really great darker (but not OTT) blushes available that would work for berry/plum lip colours :D"

AustralianMakeup,34d52m,Jessijames,3,Thu Apr 30 06:23:40 2015 UTC,Seconding this OP if you want to take that wallet hit - It isn't too full on pigment wise but you can build it up well and it compliments berries & plums in particular like a dream.

Illamasqua 'Sin' blush is a nice plum/berry colour as well but it is so pigmented it needs a lot of buffing and blending to work well.   I personally usually pair my berry/darker lips with my HG blush, Illamasqua 'Katie', which is a beautiful soft pink that goes with almost anything.   Edit: Illamasqua blush in 'Kiss' is described as a ""dusty plum colour"". It looks pretty as well, but I haven't personally tried it."

Kat Von D is also pretty hard to find, she has a cult lipstick colour called Lolita and her Tattoo foundation is all over MUA. If she's going to be there for a couple days maybe consider getting her to order some Lorac stuff from Amazon to save yourself the conversion and shpping (it's apparently hard to find in stores there, or at least my own mum went to every Sephora and Ulta in San Fransisco and Las Vegas and couldn't find it)."

I'm excited for you!  EDIT: oh my god how could I forget Charlotte Tilbury! Available at Bergdorf Goodman and completely worth the price in my opinion.

AustralianMakeup,349iw2,Rocha_999,2,Wed Apr 29 11:18:02 2015 UTC,I've browsed but never purchased because the prices didn't seem worth it. I even found Aesop products that were cheaper at Aesop directly and DJs than strawberrynet.
AustralianMakeup,349iw2,SEXPILUS,3,Wed Apr 29 11:35:17 2015 UTC,"I gave up on Strawberrynet a long time ago. I used to order Dermalogica products and found the quality used to vary quite a bit. If it's a product that has a limited shelflife I would be wary, but otherwise you can get some good bargains."
AustralianMakeup,349iw2,deluxecreampuff,3,Wed Apr 29 12:03:48 2015 UTC,"I actually haven't bought much off Strawberrynet ever since they introduced a free shipping minimum...   However, they do sometimes have 10% off certain things, and I've gotten to the point where I have a decent loyalty discount.  Last things I bought (in March) were the Shu Uemera eyelash curler (HG!) and a 500ml Bioderma Sensibio Micellar water, both of which I got on one of their ""special"" pages. The eyelash curler ended up costing me around $16 (currently $29 at DJs) , and the Bioderma was $18 (freaking $40 at Priceline)!   I do agree that in general things aren't as cheap as they used to be, but if you keep a lookout you can still find some great bargains.  Shipping was still pretty fast for me, but I've never actually had problems with their shipping before."

The foundation is more of a summer foundation for me, as the lightest shade is just a bit too dark generally.    I really love the blush, it's easy to blend, lasts all day and a little goes a long way.    Edit: Forgot to say that the prices aren't as competitive as they used to be and I can find products I want elsewhere, cheaper. Their shipping times also vary greatly - sometimes it's quick, sometimes really slow."

Good coverage, easy to slap on with fingers, and yellow enough for my undertones! Hooray!! WR. Too Faced Primed and Poreless primer - love this, but trying to finish it. Feels really nice and moussey moisturising on my dry-sensitive skin. Definitely has a blurring effect without making my face 2D. WR. Tarte Maracuja Creaseless Concealer in light-medium sand - got this in a kit ages ago and it's super thick coverage without creasing. Also hates cold weather, because trying to squeeze product out of the damn tube is a monster feat every damn morning! It has good creamy coverage and this tube will last me forever. WNR. Blackbird Magic Trick Powder in transcluent - thanks for the destash OP ;) Love this. It's got the blurring effect downpat and doesn't accentuate my dry patches too much. Also, oil-control on my forehead has been excellent since I started using this 2 months ago. WR.  Shiro Cosmetics blush in Gelato Beach - this sample is legitimately neverending and is holy pigmented batman. Lasts all day, but can take a bit of time to blend out. WNR. Hourglass Ambient Lighting Powder in Dim Light - super light highlight on my cheeks. Pretty good. WNR - not worth the price.   Eyes   Too Faced Chocolate Bar palette - specifically shades White Chocolate, Milk Chocolate, Salted Caramel, Hazelnut (foiled) and Marzipan (foiled). My first and only palette I own. Still smells like chocolate since I bought it a year ago - the mattes are a standout for me, but the shimmer shadows need foiling to really pop. Quality of shadows is OK now since I've discovered indies, so I've been trying to pan this palette since January. Still love it, but not as much. WNR. Too Faced Shadow Insurance - primer. Okay - it does the job. Can separate sometimes though, so needs a good shake. WNR. Etude House Drawing Brow liner in Grey - my HG. Best angled colour pigment and a spooly brush at the end. WR. Majorica Majolica Lash Expander mascara - fibre-based mascara baby! Also a bitch to get off. Lasts allllll day, makes my short stubby Asian lashes nice and long with just enough natural volume, plus holds a curl to shame. WR.   Perfume is Sixteen92's Rei, which I'm not sure is makeup..? WR.  I don't really do lips apart from my Burt's Bees lipbalm I'm trying to use up along with my Korres Mandarin Lip Balm in Peach - taking forever!!  I'm sorry this is so long omg.

I'm so glad the Blackbird powder works well for you!! I'm finally starting to notice my powder is looking a little emptier and considering I got it like Nov last year I'm really impressed. I'm scared about running out, because with shipping it'll be expensive to replace it compared to all the cheap finishing powders I can grab at Priceline.   And argh I wanted to grab the Etude House brow liner but didn't. I may have to try it as I think Life's Entropy's brow theory is beyond my skill level right now. Do you have black eyebrows? Is the grey a good match? I have a grey Shiseido pencil I got off eBay ages ago (before I knew that it might be a fake) and the colour seems to match far better than the dark browns that I keep seeing in our stores.   Also OT but thank you for the AB tips!! I ended up getting most of my stuff from the RRS eBay site and I'm so excited for this haul to arrive! :D"
AustralianMakeup,348f24,pondicus,1 point,Wed Apr 29 05:20:59 2015 UTC,"Hello! Yes, the grey tends to be a good match. My hair is naturally black-brown, so black is too harsh for my brows but grey is just right. I tried a NYX dark brown powder once and it wasn't right shade-wise. I'd definitely recommend a grey liner for next time you get a RRS haul - Etude House is so cheap too and lasts me a good 5-6 months.   Oh man, I haven't been game enough to try a pomade - I'm klutzy enough with mascara let alone painting on a brow hahah."

It was pathetic how thick and black my brows looked. I know everyone says it has a learning curve but I thought I had seen enough tutorials to pull off something semi-decent looking. No. Not even close. I think I'm just gonna end up sticking to my natural brows, big bald spots and all, since my fringe hides most of my brow sins ;)"

It's marked up by 30%, but it seems feasible? There's also Rakuten, which is a minefield to navigate - maybe /r/AsianBeauty could help? I've been meaning to check it out myself. Good luck! :)"

AustralianMakeup,348f24,Artemisian11,5,Wed Apr 29 08:11:38 2015 UTC,"Welp, I'm at home studying today so don't have anything on my face, but this is what I'll wear if I'm doing my whole face. It's taken a while for me to build up these products and figure out what I like. So here goes...  Face   Hourglass Mineral Veil Primer: I absolutely adore this primer. It minimises redness and makes my skin sooo soft and smooth, and keeps my makeup on all day (I'm a horrible face sweater) WR Estee Lauder Double Wear Foundation in 2N1 Desert Beige - Looove this foundation. Good coverage, can sheer it out with a beauty blender or make it full on with a Sigma F80 (which is also worth getting your hands on! Seriously changed my foundation game!). Lasts all day, rarely need to touch up. WR but I need a lighter colour now. Estee Lauder Double Wear Concealer in Light - used under eyes. Kind of thick, so I only put on a tiny dab and spread it out with my RT deluxe crease brush from the eye set. Also lasts all day but I want to try some other high end concealers. WNR unless there's a FGWP when I repurchase the foundation. Hourglass Ambient Lighting Powder in Dim Light - swept all over face. Really softens the base and makes me look flawless. It's everything I'd ever hoped for. WR NARS Laguna Bronzer - I got it in the little compact with Orgasm because I didn't want to spend so much on either. I love this bronzer for everyday use. Very subtle, but I can see the difference. WR Hourglass Ambient Lighting Blush in Mood Exposure - my favourite blush of all time. Gives me a natural flush and shape to my cheeks, without being dramatic. Plus, it looks like bacon in the pan. WR Chi Chi baked eyeshadow in Call Me (used as highlight) - can be made really intense or subtle, easy to blend, a nice highlight but has some chunky glitter bits (which I can usually flick off with a small fan brush). WNR because I want to get Mary Lou-Manizer.   Eyes   Models Prefer Eyeshadow Primer - got this in a set well over a year ago now. It still has heaps left and I'm trying to use it up. Keeps my eyeshadow perfect, even on big nights out and I've passed out somewhere it'll still look fab in the morning. WNR because I have so many eye primers I need to use. NYX Milk - self explanatory. I swipe in on straight from the pencil then blend it in with my ring finger. WR Too Faced Chocolate Bar Palette - amazing. Although as /u/pondicus said the glitter/foil shadows can be tricky to make the most of. WR if it ever came to that haha Stila Eyes are the Window to the Soul Palette - absolutely love this palette. WR if I used it all up Urban Decay 24/7 Pencil Eyeliner in Black - nice and smooth, wears well, not convinced it's the greatest (especially for the price). Need to experiment with it a bit more. Not sure if I'd repurchase or not. Stila Stay All Day Liquid Eyeliner in Black - am on my second one. This is my favourite eyeliner of all time (Sorry Maybelline Master Precise). I wore this to a Foo Fighters concert a few weeks ago and my wings were still perfect when I got home. Can't recommend this enough. Have and will repurchase. Covergirl Clump Crusher Extensions Mascara - love love love this mascara as a daily mascara or base mascara when I want a more intense look. Separates my lashes and are like a ""your lashes but better"" mascara. Have and WR NYX Le Chic Flick Mascara - was a FGWP, I'm not impressed. It reminds me of the crappy mascaras you'd get in those huge makeup sets. Using it on top of Clump Crusher, really trying to use it up. WNR   Brows   Anastasia Beverly Hills Dipbrow Pomade in Dark Brown - definitely lives up to the hype after the learning curve. I do the same swirling it around in the lid thingy and that definitely helps. My brows look fuller whilst looking natural, they stay on all day (unlike the ELF kit) and I'm happy I got it. WR.   I then use Urban Decay All Nighter Setting Spray at the end and I've definitely noticed the difference in my makeup staying time since I got it. I never need to retouch now. Hallelujah!  Sorry for this wall of text hahaha."
AustralianMakeup,348f24,whitelacecollars,3,Wed Apr 29 08:49:41 2015 UTC,What is the swirling it in the lid thingy?! Am I missing some magic trick?!
AustralianMakeup,348f24,dancepantz,2,Wed Apr 29 11:31:50 2015 UTC,Dip it then swirl it in the lid a bit to remove the excess. It's much easier to control and build it up rather than accidentally putting too much on straight out :)
AustralianMakeup,348f24,whitelacecollars,1 point,Wed Apr 29 13:52:59 2015 UTC,Ooh I'll have to give that a go... Does it make the lid all crusty and weird?

AustralianMakeup,348f24,pondicus,2,Thu Apr 30 07:27:48 2015 UTC,"I've got NYX Le Chic as well, and exactly my thoughts - it's bog standard. I do the same, chuck it over Clump Crusher and try to call it a win."
AustralianMakeup,348f24,Jessijames,2,Wed Apr 29 12:17:34 2015 UTC,"Omg I wore the exact same base as you basically: hourglass primer, estee lauder double wear foundation in 2N1, Laguna, mood exposure, (except I used guerlain meteorites and nars creamy concealer instead)  It's so freaky!"
AustralianMakeup,348f24,Jessijames,1 point,Wed Apr 29 13:46:30 2015 UTC,"Spooky!! Nars face products don't really go with my skin. I've tried sheer glow and luminous weightless foundation, and had the creamy concealer applied at Mecca and it didn't last at all :/ How do you find the meteorites? Are they worth the hype/money?"
AustralianMakeup,348f24,pondicus,1 point,Wed Apr 29 13:55:04 2015 UTC,I find liquid concealers to not last well on me! I finished up my etude house stick concealer a week ago and am waiting for a new one to come in so the nars is just a place filler to be honest! I'm almost done it so I'll probably use it til it's done and then move on :)  The meteorites are alright I guess... They're nice and soften up the harshness of the double wear but they're not exactly revolutionary. But they're gonna last for ages so I guess it's a worth investment! I really wanted to love the hourglass powders but it clung to my dry patches :(
AustralianMakeup,348f24,Jessijames,3,Thu Apr 30 08:44:01 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm at work today and on work days I usually do a full face.  One thing I have noticed which is interesting (at least to me) is about the Revlon Colourstay (Ivory, oily/combo version). I first purchased this last year sometime and at that point it was one of the best foundations I had ever owned, and for once a 'drugstore' foundation wasn't lightyears too dark and gave me a good amount of coverage. I did however struggle with it being cakey and not looking 'smooth' on my face.  Cue me purchasing MAC Studio Fix Fluid a couple of months later - the shade (NW10) was shockingly to me at the time an even better match than the Revlon. I fell in love and denounced the Revlon in favour of the MAC deciding I loved it far more than the Revlon and was probably never going to repurchase the Revlon.  After a few months, I realised the finish of the MAC wan't all that better than the Revlon even though I preferred the colour and moved on to other foundations again (yes, I have a problem.).  Fast forward another few months and I discovered /r/skincareaddiction - let me tell you, I begrudgingly used up the studio fix just to be done with it and disliked it at that point and vowed to not repurchase. Since SCA, my skincare routine has changed hugely - and while at naked appearance, the improvements are only small the hugest difference it has made to me is just how foundation sits/looks/feels better on my skin. I am working on panning the Revlon now and I fugging LOVE THIS SHIT now, it blends and looks like a goddamn dream and I am already wanting to re-purchase even though I'm on a flipping foundation no-buy. I am now wondering if the Studio Fix is worth trying again and if it's wear will be improved?   Regardless, any foundations I have been using lately look better on my skin than I remember and I can only put it down to SCA and having a better and more consistent routine for sure!!  WOW that was an essay, in short I am wearing the Revlon today and I really like it now.... hahaha I am also wearing MAC's Fleshpot on my lips which holy heck I also didn't really like at first but it has now grown on me like mad & I'm glad I grabbed this instead of Myth now! It has pretty great lasting power on me and is a nice 'pale nude' that doesn't wash me out like everything else I've ever tried. MAC's satin formula is the tits as well and feels like silk to me! I have it topped with NYX Butter Gloss in Eclair - they go very well together! I've also been using the Park Ave Princess bronzer from the Aqualillies palette as a contour shade, and I must say I am preferring it very muchly to my Too Faced Milk Choc Soleil. It's much cooler, less orangey and looks much more natural on me! I just wish it was easier to get my hands on a full size!  PS. I love the idea of this thread :)"
AustralianMakeup,348f24,pondicus,1 point,Wed Apr 29 03:39:43 2015 UTC,Can you get a sample from MAC to test on your skin again? Congrats on getting it under control!! I'm still fighting battle with mine. Gargh.
AustralianMakeup,348f24,pondicus,2,Wed Apr 29 03:51:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's what I'm going to try and do although the girls at every MAC counter near me are so rude that I really don't want to! I am going to dig out the bottle from my cupboard, I feel like there was some left in the bottom I didn't really care enough about to scrape out!!  Yeah, it's a tough battle. I have seen a general improvement in spot acne, I don't get as many random pimples anymore but my pores are still so awful with little to no change. I also have some acne scarring on one side of my face which I hate, whenever I take photos for FOTD posts it is so obvious to me so down the track I want to look at something to reduce the appearance of the scarring but for now I am happy to stick to this and keep fighting!"
AustralianMakeup,348f24,WarlockPanda,1 point,Wed Apr 29 04:02:30 2015 UTC,"Gentle chemical exfoliation, vitamin C and products with niacinamide can help with PIH/acne scarring. I've been getting all my advice from /r/AsianBeauty personally - haven't taken the plunge with any products yet though.   Totally feel you on one-sided facial scarring - sigh! You'll be alright. And hey, end of the day - you're still you."
AustralianMakeup,348f24,pondicus,1 point,Wed Apr 29 04:19:08 2015 UTC,"Hey if I can butt in with some totally unwarranted advice - the only thing that really helped my acne scars was this - Botani skin serum. I find that even though it's an oil it sinks into my skin really well and by the time I finished a bottle, my scars had noticeably improved. It's also helped me from scarring when I do have the odd hormone related spot. I waited till it was on sale at Priceline to pick up my 2nd bottle but even for $30 I would repurchase cause it's worked really well for me. I'm guessing it's mostly the vit c that helps - I believe studies haven't found any link between vit e and scar fading but either way I swear by it."
AustralianMakeup,348f24,WarlockPanda,1 point,Wed Apr 29 05:51:08 2015 UTC,"I am definitely keeping this in mind for when it's next on sale, what point in your routine do you use it? At the moment I OCM/remove makeup > Cleanse > BHA > AHA > Moisturise at night."
AustralianMakeup,348f24,Jessijames,1 point,Wed Apr 29 06:41:57 2015 UTC,"I basically use this as a moisturiser in my routine, so as my last step and if I need extra moisture I also use some macadamia oil because my skin responds really well to that. I use it morning and night and I find it doesn't affect my makeup if I apply it and give it a min or two to fully absorb. My priceline actually has testers of this out, so if you can, give it a try next time you're there. It's actually really light for an oil but very moisturising - it only takes 2 drops to cover my face. So the other bonus is that the bottle will last you ages and ages. Though once I do get a good moisturiser I'll be using it under that! It has a slight olive like scent but it's not noticeable on the skin for me anyway.  The problem I have is that the majority of facial moisturisers don't agree with my skin. I believe what I'm sensitive to is titanium dioxide - sunscreens give me a hives like rash - but even products without this in the list sometimes don't agree with me and I get really itchy red bumps within 15 mins of putting them on. So I'm still on the look out for a moisturiser that actually works with my skin. Do you have any good recs?"
AustralianMakeup,348f24,NocturnalNightingale,1 point,Wed Apr 29 06:59:29 2015 UTC,"I love discussion threads in this sub so I figured I'd start one :)  I kick myself for not taking care of my skin while I was a teenager. I could have saved myself so much hassle and lack of confidence, because now that I've started a basic routine I have noticed a huge difference too. I really have Reddit to thank - I didn't even realise skincare was a thing people actually do apart from old rich ladies ;)  I think also having a huge revelation that actually my skin isn't oily as such but just over-produces oil because it's dry has helped me immensely too. Funny thing is, using products for dry skin has actually made me far less oily :)  Long tangent aside it's funny because now I've gotten to the point where I haven't yet been able to find a foundation that looks better on me than my real skin. Not that I have like glowing perfect skin or anything. But generally I find foundation is enhancing all the little imperfections and bumps that just aren't as apparent if I'm not wearing makeup. So I've kinda had a similar but opposite journey and I'm convinced now I have to try high end foundations because the cheap stuff doesn't cut it for me (no matter how many reviews I read that proclaim the wonders of drugstore products!).  But on a related note, I got a pressed Revlon photo ready powder years ago (and never threw out because I'm gross?) and now that my skin has gotten far less oily and blemished, it works really well and I can actually see the value in it."
AustralianMakeup,348f24,NocturnalNightingale,1 point,Wed Apr 29 05:28:34 2015 UTC,"+1 for seeing the value in powder foundations - I can actually use them now and be happy with how they look & the level of coverage!  I also agree about the kicking myself for not doing more in my teens. I do feel a little bit of resentment? maybe disappointment my parents never really took the initiative when I was younger & had no idea. My Mum is somebody who doesn't do anything for her skin and never has, and the only makeup she wears is maybe a lipstick if we go out for dinner or something but that's it. I guess it was never a priority or interest to her and I can't really blame her for that. Part of me wishes she was into that stuff a little more and could have helped or guided me but I was on my own when it came to that. I used a foaming Clean & Clear cleanser in high school that helped a lot but avoided moisturiser like the plague until maybe like 1-2 years ago (I'm 25 now) because I just thought it would be worse on my oily skin - boy was I wrong! I owe a lot to Reddit too....a lot."
AustralianMakeup,348f24,NocturnalNightingale,2,Wed Apr 29 05:35:28 2015 UTC,"Maybe you and /u/smilingsunbeams might like to hear it from another perspective? I come from a family of a lot of women and my mum especially would always call me out on skincare and making myself presentable.  Which is good on the one hand, but also bad for your self-esteem when it's done daily - in my case, it's more the latter. I've been to see a lot of dermos and Asian Chinese medicine doctors (cuz that'll work as a permanent cure) and my mum will always without fail give unsolicited advice on my acne and eczema and scarring and saying I'll never get a husband with a face like that. My sister got the same, so I'm glad we have each other to depend on.  So with all that - I think Reddit/the internet is a good source, because it can provide a safer and less psychologically messy way of learning about the importance of, having fun and exploring skincare and understanding that there is no permanent cure. On the other hand, having a parent who can help understand that and support you in a way that's not hurtful is also good too!  In saying that, thanks for nothing Dolly circa 1999 for recommending Clean & Clear - more like Clean & Crap. Nivea was the only one who pulled through for me!!"
AustralianMakeup,348f24,Artemisian11,1 point,Wed Apr 29 05:54:50 2015 UTC,"Haha yeah, anything I tried from Clean & Clear outside from that plain foaming wash was AWFUL but that is the one product that did work for me. I did switch to Clearasil once I had my own job at 15-16 or so thinking it would be better but boy was I wrong again! That stuff stripped my skin and gave me probably the worst acne of my life. I remember it took months before my skin began to improve!"
AustralianMakeup,348f24,Artemisian11,1 point,Wed Apr 29 06:48:51 2015 UTC,"Yeahhhh Clearasil really seems to dehydrate your skin - no idea what they put in it, but it doesn't work!!! Stupid commercials."

That does make me glad I never had that kind of pressure from my family. I think it's really hard when parents have the best intentions but inadvertently can be causing you pain.   Haha I don't think I ever used Clean and Clear but I did use Clearasil and I'm sure something else... It came in a white tube? I also tried toothpaste as a spot treatment and because I put this huge glob on my face and slept with it on I ended up with a chemical burn type thing instead of pimple. Man the things I used to do to my face... Also I wish someone had told me to stop picking at it!!    Btw I think I started following you on instagram? I might have been a bit stalkerish by looking for it haha, I hope it's actually you I followed! ;)"

I had pimples, spots, scarring etc well into my early twenties, and although my mum would try to help by buying stuff like clearasil (wait is that what we used to use?) I think just basic skin care would have been so useful! I used to sleep in the terrible tinted moisturiser and 5 layers of mascara I used back then!!  I always used to wonder what people meant about having good skin in your twenties because my skin was so awful at one point (and if you look at my cheeks really closely you can still see the scars from that!).  I think to myself now about how much I will drill into any potential children how important skin care is, and I'm practicing that with my fiance who still does nothing to skin other than use a very high % ethanol product on his face after shaving. I still haven't gotten him convinced to moisturise! Sigh."

AustralianMakeup,348f24,deluxecreampuff,3,Wed Apr 29 06:47:16 2015 UTC,"I'm just starting to get in to wearing a full face of makeup, here's what I'm wearing today: Foundation: Maybelline Dream Wonder in classic ivory. I only just started using this but I love it! Makes my skin look great, fits my tone perfectly and has a nice soft feel, doesn't look oily or sticky at all. Concealer: I'm using a Kmart brand nude colour concealer and Maybelline green concealer. Both are okay, not the best coverage. I have a lot of redness which they both help with, but my dark under eye circles are still visible a bit. Eyes: I've used nyx milk eye pencil as a primer for some purple covergirl eyeshadow (at work so I can't check shade). Both have stayed put so far, which is good.I'm not the biggest fan of the eye pencil, but it does make my shadows pop. I used models prefer brown eyeliner, I use it everyday and love it! It has good staying power and it's a nice shade of brown. I got it as part of an eye palette. I'm wearing Maybelline full and soft mascara in very black. I'm not the biggest fan, it gives me very bad spider legs! Lips: I usually wear a Maybelline baby lips, I love them I've been a huge fan since they first came out. I'm wearing the antioxidant berry today. They make my lips so soft and don't give a sticky residue like a lot of lip balms. I also used a bit of lip colour from a Napoleon Perdis palette (can't check which one sorry!) It's a nice shade, but came of rather quickly unfortunately. Eyebrows: I started with Maybelline brow drama in medium brown. Its a pretty garbage product in my opinion. It can work okay sometimes, but you have to be careful of clumps. Its fantastic as an eyebrow shaper/wax though! I also used the models prefer brunette eyebrow palette. I love it. The colours suit me very well and the brush it comes with makes for very easy application. Setting spray: I just started using Australis makeup setting spray and I really like it. It smells nice and doesn't feel sticky like other setting sprays. It keeps my makeup on very well and I love the price!"

I've switched to macadamia oil + castor oil because I find my skin responds better to that.  I also have just starting trying a Loreal cleanser (link to priceline) - I got it for free so I figured what the hey. So far no irritation, but it does have SLS in it so it is on the drying side."

One thing I really like is the lack of hyperbole and nonsense on the products - no false tripe about natural essences, no fragrances, etc. - just effective actives.  But yeah, expensive!! I bought most of my PC stuff from their US site on a great special, before the AU site launched ... that's so much dearer T-T"

AustralianMakeup,348f24,WarlockPanda,3,Wed Apr 29 14:16:59 2015 UTC,"I am trying out the Essence All About Matt pressed powder at the moment. I am pleasantly surprised with this product, especially considering the price point!   My current base products are NYX primer, Skin 79 BB cream all over, MAC Studio Fix powder on my cheeks, neck and forehead, Natio translucent powder on my nose (I find the bit of colour it applies is actually a perfect match for my skin and it sits better under my glasses than Studio Fix which slides everywhere) and a bit of the Essence powder over the top of everything.  I find it is mattifying without leaving me cakey, and it is controlling oil for a good 6-8 hours (which for my oil slick T zone is a lot). I am working 12 hour days at the moment (8am - 8pm) and I have to reapply at about 2pm to stay completely matte, but I am really happy with it, and would definitely purchase again! Plus it's so cheap I can leave one in my work drawer, one in my bag, and not worry if it gets lost or damaged."

I don't have one because my priceline is always out of stock or the products have all been used (why?!) but my friend has this and it looks really nice on her.   Their clear lash/brow gel is also really good. It doesn't feel crunchy, but helps my brows behave a little better than their usual sticking up in every direction look.   The last time I was at Priceline, the girl there also recommended their brow kit and said it's one of the best ones out of all the brands. I knew it wouldn't match me but for someone with fairer hair, I think it would be a good product and for only $5 you also get stencils! Which might sound silly but I actually do use stencils sometimes when I'm plucking my brows to make sure I keep them even.   And not cosmetic wise - their polishes are actually decent for the price and have a really good colour range too!  I'll edit this comment if I think of anything else :)"

AustralianMakeup,348f24,pumpkinspicevodka,2,Wed Apr 29 07:54:21 2015 UTC,"Today I tried 2 new products. I used a sample of UD naked skin in 0.5, which matches well but definitely does not provide the level of coverage I expected for a foundation, it seems more like a tinted moisturizer. Especially since it feels very watery.  I also have on one of the Etude House dear my wish lips talk in OR202, which is a lovely, darker orange. I love this lipstick because it is so smooth and moisturizing. Tomorrow I will be trying out the other colour I got from the range, I hope that I like it just as much. :D  Edit: I'm also wearing a Lioele primer, MAC mineralize concealer, TonyMoly Cat Wink Pressed Powder, Covergirl mascara and a combination of eyeshadows from the Chi Chi bases and my TF <3's Sephora palette from the Pan that Palette. These are products I am trying to pan and WNR."

AustralianMakeup,348f24,Arlibie,1 point,Wed Apr 29 03:50:01 2015 UTC,"The Lioele primer is nice in the way it illuminates my skin, but that effect disappears as soon as you put a BB cream or foundation over the top. It doesn't do much in terms of making my foundation last longer compared to oil controlling primers. I've tried mixing it in to my foundation and it makes no difference. It's currently one of my project pan items. I'm just over half way through. Id be happy to send you a sample pot to try to form your own opinion.  Edit: it is the Lioele shimmering pearl base."

AustralianMakeup,348f24,xenomorphic_acid,1 point,Wed Apr 29 05:30:18 2015 UTC,"I wanted the Dancing Swan ones too but I can't seem to find a legitimate seller. I do know the Jelly Lips is sheer, but the blooming lips are supposed to be opaque.   I found that because it is a creamier formula, it doesn't last as long. It was fairly fine after having my morning coffee, but it was necessary to touch up after lunch. The shape of the bullet is not the same as most lipsticks (it is circular and most are pointed), so I found it difficult to get the right shape around the cupids bow."

The only high end ish pencil I've tried is ByTerry's and it is so crap and basically performs the same as my $2 kohl stick.

I'm wearing my Maybelline Pure Dream BB Cream in Light/Oily mixed with a pump of Make Up For Ever's HD Foundation. The coverage is pretty light on but I tend to go a bit nuts with my concealers (Maybelline Instant Age Rewind Eraser Eye Concealer for my under-eye area and Benefit's Boi-ing for imperfections) so that amps up the coverage where I need it most. On top I've got my Bourjois Healthy Balance Unifying Powder, which I'm lovinggggg.  My eyebrows are lightly filled in with my HG, Anastasia Beverly Hills BrowWiz pencil and mascara is also a HG – Maybelline Full 'N Soft. I actually bought the Kevin Aucoin Curling Mascara the other day after reading some great reviews here. I find it a bit tedious to apply to my top lashes but I love it for my bottom lashes as it's smudge-free. No time to apply shadow today so my lids are bare.  For cheeks I'm wearing my new Luma by Jess Hart blush in Soft Peach, which is heaven in a pan. So freaking pigmented but an absolute dream to blend. I'm loving peach tones at the moment.  Finally, lips are topped with a Burt's Bees tinted balm (can't remember the shade name)."

AustralianMakeup,348f24,Tonkie,1 point,Wed Apr 29 07:19:37 2015 UTC,No I haven't but I am super impressed with the blush. The product range is pretty small at the moment so will be interested to see if more products are added in the near future.

AustralianMakeup,348n9l,Artemisian11,4,Mon May 4 12:07:11 2015 UTC,"Don't think anyone's mentioned them so far, so the Colour Inject lipsticks - I actually really love them. They feel very creamy and not at all drying, and the colours are a big win for me. They don't have any special lasting properties, but for the price and the ease of wearing them I'm okay with it! Mambo is a spot on MLBB for me, Can Can is loooooovely, Grunge is very fun (but I do find the application patchier). I've got a few others, but haven't worn them enough to comment on those.  I'm another vote for the Fresh + Flawless powder, I find it a similar consistency to MAC Studio Fix. There's the A C On Tour kit, but I'm terrible at using it - a beauty therapist friend of mine loves it, if that's any help!"

AustralianMakeup,348n9l,freezethefire,2,Thu Apr 30 06:06:49 2015 UTC,"Yes I love the lipsticks too! There's something about the formula that just makes it the easiest to wear I own - not drying, opaque colour, not sticky or slippery, lasts fairly long. I have mambo, electro, salsa and grunge, they're great! Just a spot on, simple lipstick formula, its not trying to do too much you know? So its not a formula I have to constantly worry about whilst wearing!"
AustralianMakeup,348n9l,ailee612,1 point,Fri May 1 13:28:12 2015 UTC,"Yup, that's pretty much my thoughts in a nutshell. Certainly not the best I've ever had/worn, but solid and consistent, and just ... comfortable? I don't know how else to put it."
AustralianMakeup,348n9l,ComingUpMilhouse,2,Fri May 1 13:31:04 2015 UTC,"Exactly! I have mattes and liquid to mattes and stains and all those fancy things but these are just a simple, killer formula. Similar to rimmel Kate moss (black tube) actually as well. The matte Kate moss ones I dont like as much."
AustralianMakeup,348n9l,ailee612,5,Fri May 1 14:02:53 2015 UTC,"I have 4 Velourlips: Shang-Hi, Mi-A-Mee, NYC and Maliboo. I've used all of them except Maliboo, just because Maliboo is such a bright colour that I haven't gotten around to wearing it. I love the other three colours though! However, they can be quite drying... they can be quite sticky unless you use multiple light layers, so they do require a bit of lip maintenance, if you know what I mean. That being said, they do last a long time and the shades I have are very opaque and matte!  I also have the AC on Tour palette and I see a lot of people on this post don't know how to use it. I actually really like it, even if it is a little powdery. I think it's one of the better budget-friendly contour options out there.   I might just detail how I like to use it, for those of you who maybe want some ideas? I like using the bottom middle shade as my contour shade because it's the coolest of the 3 contour shades, and therefore best mimics what a natural shadow actually looks like. I just put it on an angled blush/contour brush and sweep it underneath my cheekbones, starting pretty much parallel to the end of my eyebrow and going up, and then blending. The other two contour shades are quite a bit warmer, but if you have a warm skin-tone then that can actually look a little more natural. I sometimes use the bottom left shade instead of the bottom middle if I want a slightly warmer contour, and I think it looks pretty nice.   In terms of the highlight shades, I mainly use the middle yellow, ""banana"" powder shade. I use it underneath my cheekbone contour to clean up my contour, and also underneath the eyes to set my concealer if I want to brighten that area a little. The more pink toned, matte highlight on the top left I also use to set my under-eye concealer, but I'm quite pale so depending on your skin-tone that might not work for you. The top right is a nice shimmery highlight, the only one of the palette, and if I did use it I'd probably get a fan brush and sweep it lightly on top of the cheekbones. I don't use it, but that's only because I'm addicted to my Mary-Loumaniser!  Oh my god, I swear I was not trying to make this into an essay... But hopefully maybe I've helped someone!"
AustralianMakeup,348n9l,TeaBasedAnimal,3,Thu Apr 30 07:17:42 2015 UTC,You know the velourlips are totally mixable right? You might be able to make Maliboo wearable by mixing it with something.

AustralianMakeup,348n9l,Jessijames,1 point,Thu May 21 02:01:53 2015 UTC,That's odd... The Australis eye shadow primer caused creasing and sliding for me. It's like the eyeshadow just slid off my face.
AustralianMakeup,348n9l,damn-croissants,5,Fri May 1 03:51:35 2015 UTC,The only Australis product I've ever enjoyed using is the Metallix eyeshadows. Seriously great formulation.
AustralianMakeup,348n9l,Jessijames,1 point,Wed Apr 29 12:15:09 2015 UTC,Seconding this!
AustralianMakeup,348n9l,ComingUpMilhouse,7,Fri May 1 03:03:09 2015 UTC,"Like, hot damn the Ready Set Go finishing powder....I have tried a boatload of different powders to set my makeup with to help control the oil pit that my face becomes by lunchtime every.damn.day. This is hands down, by far the single best thing I have ever found for setting and controlling oil. I have multiple backups because it's so cheap! I really do want to try MAC's loose translucent setting powder just to compare, but I think the ingredients are probably super similar and just as finely milled so it's proooobably not worth it if they're essentially the same product.  On the flipside, a lot of people swear by the Fresh & Flawless compact powder - I loathed it. It did nothing for my oil, and even a light dusting made me look like cake-city I just couldn't get it to work and ended up tossing it before barely hitting pan!   Their Metallix cream shadows are really great too IMO but they could be a little less glittery - like more of a straight metallic, not 50% metallic 50% glitter but they work well for me and are really easily buildable. They don't really crease on me even without a primer but I have fairly normal lids. They blend out really swell, and also work as a base for a powder shadow too.  I like the Velour Lips, the colour range is really quite nice with the great additions over the last 6 months or so. I do find the formula between shades (at least the 10 or so I own) really inconsistent with how they set and evenness/opaqueness varying a lot. End of the day, for the price they're pretty great and last long enough on me! I just don't like that in my experience they don't fully dry or set they stay a very slight tacky feel which I feel makes them not as long lasting because they tug.  I haven't really tried any of their foundations, every time I am tempted and swatch them they look easily 2-3 shades too dark &/or orange for me so I've never tried. Their shade range overall is severely lacking in the face department!"
AustralianMakeup,348n9l,Jessijames,4,Wed Apr 29 05:49:44 2015 UTC,I have such a love/hate relationship with the Ready Set Go powder. I got it because I asked here and people seemed to love it and I'm glad I did because it is great but the packaging is so terrible! I find it gets everywhere when I use it and also the lid gets stuck because it gets all over the edges.
AustralianMakeup,348n9l,ComingUpMilhouse,3,Wed Apr 29 06:07:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah the packaging is the pits for sure, I just keep it upright on my vanity and am careful to never tip is on its side or anything and only give it a gentle shake when I want some product to pop up through the sifter. As for the edges of the rim, what I do most days to help clear that away is just rest the lid back on but don't start twisting it, then grab my powder brush and gently run it side to side around the whole rim, it gets in that crack without getting everywhere etc and then I just gently screw the cap on properly. Still nor perfect, but it stops it getting everywhere for me haha"

I have fairly oily lids and without a primer the eyeshadows do crease on me by the end of the day, but I tend to wear primer all of the time anyway. ]  Edit - I realised I forgot my Australis pencil sharpener! That thing is awesome because it's just the right size to fit jumbo pencils like NYX Milk but also fits all my slimmer ones too, and it's really handy to use on the go cause it has a little tray for sharpenings, so if you're in a hurry you can just sharpen and then throw it out later!"

Agree with Velourlips, Ready Set Go powder and Fresh and Flawless powder. I have the Browzit kit and really like it, although the colours are quite dark which is fine when my hair is brown but a bit much with my natural blonde. The Mega Lash mascara is quite good too but the waterproof one is an absolute pain to remove!

It just doesn't do anything exceptional in terms of length or curl or whatever.  I also have an eye shadow which I love, their 4-in-1 concealer and the Oh Hai Brow palette.

NYCEE is the best of these in terms of application, opacity, wear time, etc but they are all lovely colours. I've heard bad things about a couple of the other shades, mostly the really light ones, but they aren't my thing anyway. Look up the shade online before buying would be my recommendation.  Matte lip base - supposed to turn any lipstick matte. It doesn't make them as matte as velourlips, but it takes away a lot of the gloss and increases wear time. I've tried it with Australis and NYX lipsticks.  Lipstick - I only have one, I got it in a multipack with NYCEE from KMart. It's nice, not sure if the colour suits me though."

AustralianMakeup,348n9l,Tuipie,2,Wed Apr 29 14:23:23 2015 UTC,"I love my Velourlips in Grandmaster Pash. I believe it is my most favourite lip colour, and it is long lasting, if a might drying. It applies easily, and is opaque. I'm in love with the almost brushed metal look at the end.  I do have several of their other lip mattes, but they're not really a hit. Paree turns half grey, and Milano and Honolooloo turn bright orange on me. That's more likely an issue with my lips, however. The latter two being streaky is entirely on them, though."
AustralianMakeup,348n9l,spooknat,1 point,Thu Apr 30 08:32:45 2015 UTC,"I might have accidentally bought all the LE Velourlips and they also mix really well with regular lipsticks!  If you don't mind me butting in with a totally unwarranted rec, the newer shades seem to have a better formula, in my experience anyway. I noticed even swatching in store the older ones were so so but the newer ones seem to go on a lot more evenly and wear better too, though I don't think any reformulation or anything was ever announced."
AustralianMakeup,348n9l,courpsey,2,Thu Apr 30 15:23:25 2015 UTC,"Haha. I may own all three LE ones, too. :X But Grandmaster Pash is the one with a special place in my heart.   Hmm. I wonder if they were reformulated, or because the new ones, overall, were brighter and darker colours? There wasn't really nudes, especially pink-orange ones like Milano and Honolooloo."
AustralianMakeup,348n9l,spooknat,1 point,Thu Apr 30 22:07:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah good point. The closest I can think of is that bubblegummy pink colour which I cbf looking up the name of.

Like, you might as well just pat a light green glitter eye shadow over your redness for the same effect. What were they thinking?  I like the pressed powder but preferred the old packaging so much more, ugh!  Thinking of buying Bacelona velourlips. I loved that they did metallic matte liquid lipsticks! I hope they do some more muted colours in the Veluorlips range."

This is much more product than in the blush, which has less than half of the product (0.35oz vs 0.15oz). When you add the conversion the $50USD comes out to $64.78NZD.

I love love love matte black lipsticks, and highly recommend Fyrinnae's liquid matte lipstick in Interstellar (Fyrinnae close all the time and they're closed rright now but they'll be open soon and shipping is super reasonable and the lipsticks themselves are actually super affordable) and Pretty Zombie Cosmetics' Black Cat which you can get in Aus online at Lipstick Republic and it's not advertised as transfer-proof but both of them are really nicely long wearing which is great when it comes to high maintenance colours like black. I haven't tried the Jeffree Star, because I don't need another matte black, but I've heard good things.  If you're in the market for a matte formula that isn't liquid, you might be looking at greater expense, but Melt Cosmetics do a black ultra matte lipstick called Bane. Illamasqua and Kat Von D also do black lipsticks in tube lipstick form. Sportsgirl had a surprisingly nice black lipstick but I believe it's discontinued (I got it for 99c)."

AustralianMakeup,34105m,neccessarygirl,1 point,Mon Apr 27 13:27:47 2015 UTC,The Fudge one is AMAZING but it's basically the strongest one you can buy. The great thing about it is you can use it once a week or even once a fortnight and still get great results.
AustralianMakeup,34105m,walkyouhome,1 point,Mon Apr 27 13:43:14 2015 UTC,"Agree with the Fudge one! It's so good, but super potent, ie it will leave your hair with a tinge of purple if you leave it in too long. I've been there before!"
AustralianMakeup,34105m,deadlypony,1 point,Tue Apr 28 03:02:19 2015 UTC,"Also vote the fudge shampoo, but definitely use some trial and error as far as how long to leave it in..haven't managed to turn my hair purple, but have managed to turn my hair silver/grey"
AustralianMakeup,34105m,VelociraptorAlex,5,Tue Apr 28 04:43:31 2015 UTC,"the nak purple shampoo is really pigmented and does a really good job at toning. i actually really love the vitafive CPR blonde solutions range - especially the mask. It's more of a blue-violet kind of colour but it's super hydrating and tones really really well. since you've got naturally light hair, john frieda has a purple shampoo range specifically for your hair type, i've used their bleached blonde shampoos and i do like them so i'd imagine it's the same for the others :) note: i did have black hair and bleached it to a light blonde so the treatments i used may be a little strong for your hair"
AustralianMakeup,34105m,elfies_,4,Wed Apr 29 05:43:56 2015 UTC,"DeLorenzo make a wonderful one, and it smells amazing. It's a bit expensive, though. Lush also make a reasonable purple shampoo."

AustralianMakeup,34105m,jen-iscool,3,Mon Apr 27 13:42:18 2015 UTC,"Former hairdresser here, I'll list the shampoos I know of and my opinion.    So the Fudge one is insanely popular, it's probably the strongest on the market and turned my hair blue. While everyone raves about it, I think it's to strong I could never get it right and my hair was either yellow or blue.    Nak has two great blonde shampoos, the normal and blonde plus. I use blonde plus and it's the blonde shampoo I always come back to. Never had a problem with it. However with Nak you either love the whole brand or you hate it. So if you've used any of their products before and weren't sure, you probably won't like it.    Redken have a new blonde shampoo out where you can adjust how strong it is, but it's designed to last between appointment visits. So towards the end of 6 weeks when you should be due to buy a new bottle it'll be stronger and since you don't bleach your hair I wouldn't recommend it.    Juuce have a total of 3 or 4 blonde shampoos in all the ranges they offer. I don't rave about the brand and most people repurchase because they have good deals. I find each product has something I don't like about it and everything is to heavily perfumed. I nearly passed out in the shower the first time I used one of their shampoos because of the smell and had to give the products I just bought to someone else.    Goldwell's blonde range is beautiful, smells amazing and I'd use it if I could. I have a certain type of hair plus scalp problems and sulphate free works better for me so I can't use this. Haven't heard a bad thing about this range.    Overall my picks are Goldwell or Nak. Goldwell is a bit more nourishing, so if your hair is thicker that's my pick."
AustralianMakeup,34105m,Crumpet92,2,Tue Apr 28 01:13:21 2015 UTC,"Love it, I've used the regular color one and think it's great. Haven't used the blonde one personally but I've used it on clients and haven't seen any problems. The only thing is it's cheap and the strength of the purple tone isn't the strongest, but for the price you can't complain.    The products in the range are pretty good for the price as well, although they are more watered down compared to what you would pay normally.    I have very fine hair that gets oily easily so I can use this range no problem, if you have thicker hair that needs more moisture I wouldn't recommend it."
AustralianMakeup,34105m,Crumpet92,2,Tue Apr 28 06:33:55 2015 UTC,"I really like the Nak one, it's very pigmented.   Review (not my blog): http://www.keepingupwithme.net/2010/10/best-shampoo-and-conditioner-for.html"

Comes with shampoo and conditioner if you wanted it and is mild. Schwarzkopf and redken are quite strong shampoos. Purple shampoo can be a little drying so you do need a nice conditioner for afterwards."

AustralianMakeup,34105m,becabecaful,1 point,Mon Apr 27 15:05:26 2015 UTC,"When I was platinum I usually used redken anti snap shampoo and conditioner if I was really damaged, or L'Oréal amino cell shampoo and conditioner in the yellow bottle, plus a treatment once a week. The yellow L'Oréal conditioner could be a good start as it has some protein and moisture. Otherwise any salon moisture conditioner would do the trick. I haven't used much of them to have a preference."

Also this NARS foreplay pallete was originally sold as a Limited Edidtion exclusive to Sephora back in 2012, so why are they selling this 3 year old LE pallete and where did they get it from? Even the wording they use to desribe is shady. They just say 'peach matte blush' and 'gold highlighter blush' not the actual names of the product.   Also this product was again originally sold in 2010 as LE. That was 5 years ago so it wouldn't be excess stock and NARS doesn't re-release.

AustralianMakeup,33wv1g,hez_lea,1 point,Sun Apr 26 12:34:25 2015 UTC,This is probably my only HG item in my collection. I have just started my third tube since subscribing to /r/MUA. You really only need the tiniest bit too so it takes about 6-9 months to work through a tube!
AustralianMakeup,33wv1g,WarlockPanda,5,Sun Apr 26 23:14:46 2015 UTC,"Things I'm loving at the moment:  Skincare   Paula's Choice stuff, especially their chemical exfoliators. I've been using them for a couple years now and I'm very happy. Lucas Paw Paw ointment, I've been using it nightly on my face since I was a teen and it really helps. I have oily skin that I touch far too much and chronic sinusitis and it really helps my skin heal without clogging it up. I'm definitely living the slug life. I use LaRoche Posay sunscreen because it doesn't feel greasy and I haven't reacted to it. I've been using it for a couple years now.   Makeup   Brow: Illamasqua brow cake (in Thunder). My dipbrow has dried out and is now a little difficult to apply but my trusty brow cake is years older and still going strong. Mascara: I really like CG's Clump Crusher and the waterproof Lash Blast but I have a sample of a Buxom mascara and its really amazing. Eyeshadow Palettes: The UD Naked Basics palettes are pretty amazing (I've had one for a few years now and I need 2), I really like the now discontinued Stila In The... palettes, I really like my Lorac PP and Too Faced Chocolate Bar. Oh and my discontinued Kat Von D Ladybird palette, I'll be really sad when that hits pan.  Blush: I have the Hourglass Ambient Blush Palette but I've only really played with Mood Exposure and that colour is seriously HG for me. I really rate Sleek and The Balm blushes, Hot Mama and Rose Gold are very similar colours but I'm happy to have both.  Concealer: MAC Studio Finish but I need to investigate a good liquid concealer.  Lip balm: Nivea Essential Care (the blue one) it's a perfect base and I use the Lisa Eldridge method of that and a cotton bud for lip exfoliation. Lipstick: I'm loving the Too Faced Melted formula but I only have Melted Peony and Melted Villain, I have a small collection of MAC lipsticks (I have mostly matte and a few amplifieds and satins) and I really rate them. I have a soft spot for the Estee Lauder Signature Lipsticks because the gold packaging makes me feel glamorous and the formula is lovely. Glitter: I am very fond of my Lit Glitters and OCC glitters. From OCC I adore Mirrorball and the aptly named Beige (worst fucking name ever), from Lit I love Vitamin C and Oprah. Oh and you can use Inglot's Duraline to apply them without hassle.   Tools   I used a BeautyBlender for the first time the other day and now I see what I was missing. I like my old Real Techniques and Eco Tools brushes but my recent Zoeva additions are just stunning. I've also bought some Sigma eye brushes that are very nice. Oh and I have some trusty Illamasqua brushes that I rate. I bought a set of Tweezerman tweezers in a purple leather pouch a while back and since then I haven't had to suffer those visible hairs that the damn tweezer refuses to grab. Shu Uemura lash curler.   Hair   I have a branded Tangle Teezer and a Beauty Bay version and they're both very good. The BB has longer bristles but I have long hair so my hair doesn't mind. I have very straight, fine, silky hair and these brushes are completely HG. I once used one of those crazy expensive Mason Pearson boar bristle brushes without having any idea of the hype and I instantly had to ask about the magic wand that I was borrowing. I haven't been able to do a side by side comparison, but without dropping all the money on a brush I've bought a perfectly nice Lady Jane substitute in both handbag size and the normal paddle size. All of the dry shampoo, currently Batiste but not because it has proven itself mightier than the other brands.   Nails   I want to throw in that I've loved every polish that I've bought via Femme Fatale. That includes her polishes, Emily De Molly, Sayuri and Cirque. Those are all glitters, holos, etc. I haven't bought indie solid colour creams. Face of Australia does some lovely nail polishes. The Girly Bits glitter topcoat is excellent.   I promise that I didn't set out to write a novel."
AustralianMakeup,33wv1g,ComingUpMilhouse,8,Mon Apr 27 11:38:31 2015 UTC,"Skincare:    the Paula's Choice range, but especially their AHA and BHA chemical exfoliators. My skin has been saved. Nivea creme. Dat nightcream.   Makeup:    Australis Fresh and Flawless pressed powder. Sets foundation or provides light coverage alone. Brilliant staying power and oil control. Wet n Wild eyeshadow singles in Brulle (perfect base colour for fair skins) and Nutty (my go-to all over wash of colour lazy eye, or makes a nice buildable crease colour). Rimmel Stay Matte Primer. Actually does what it says. Stila In The Light pallet. All thriller no filler. Estee Lauder Double Wear foundation. I use it pretty sheer with a beauty blender and it stays perfect all damn day. Models Prefer Soft Touch pressed powders. Almost perfect dupes for the Hourglass Ambient Light powders. Ben Nye Final Seal spray (for hardcore days) and Neutral Set powder (normal day). Actually does what it says."

AustralianMakeup,33wv1g,Artemisian11,4,Mon Apr 27 07:08:12 2015 UTC,"Another vote for Paula's Choice, I love their chemical exfoliators and sensitive skin toner. I can't recommend the moisturiser I got (sensitive skin) - it worked fine, but at double the price and half the size of ... Natio! I'm not sure what others think of them, but their Renew SPF 30+ moisturiser is one of my favourites. It's just the right consistency for my face and the feel I like.   For make-up!   Bourjois Healthy Mix foundation - just started using this, and I love it. Smooth, dewey, gorgeous finish (using sponge application anyway). MAC Studio Fix powder - wasn't a fan of the liquid, but hotdamn I love this powder! Australis Fresh & Flawless powder is a pretty good substitute though I'd say. Covergirl Clump Crusher - the easiest mascara I have to apply, as I tend to get clumpy bits very easily. I usually put a more dramatic mascara over the top as well, preferably Urban Decay Perversion. Benefit Majorette - lovelovelovelove. Perfect colour, super easy and smooth to apply. I'll wear on its own if it's a lazy day, or matched with NARS Liberte for more effect. Urban Decay Naked Basics (1 + 2): I love matte neutrals, so these are perfect for me. Very pigmented and buttery-smooth, a pleasure to apply. Pricey, but I think worth it, especially for travel. Rimmel Provocalips - I picked up one of these (Make Your Move, I think?) and holy shit it STAYS. Like, I wore it all day, cleaned my face with coconut oil, realised it was still there and had to scrub it off with the oil. For the lazy and messy like me, it's a dream! And the colour is very wearable with my olive skin tone, just suits everything.   I could rave about a lot of things, but they're ones that immediately spring to mind!"
AustralianMakeup,33wv1g,Artemisian11,1 point,Sun Apr 26 15:20:14 2015 UTC,Your HG's are the same as mine. I hate spending money on things only to hate them but since we pretty much like the same things I'm going to have to check out Provocalips.
AustralianMakeup,33wv1g,elaboratekicks,3,Mon Apr 27 00:52:28 2015 UTC,"I picked one up in the 40% Priceline sale, since I hadn't them before - it's now my favourite liquid to date. It's one of those with the gloss other side to it - that I'm less fussed over, I don't need shiny lips, but the base colour is what keeps me in love. When I first tried a bit on my hand in Priceline the colour was still there 2 days after, after however many hand washes, so that was a good start.  Hope you like them as much as I do!"
AustralianMakeup,33wv1g,Artemisian11,1 point,Mon Apr 27 01:52:46 2015 UTC,"Natio is my absolute favourite when it comes to moisturisers! Their make-up and other skincare I don't like that much, but their moisterisers are the best thing to ever happen to me.  I particularly like their daytime gel for a light moisteriser, and their SPF50+ for my daily coverage."
AustralianMakeup,33wv1g,NotForTheNote,1 point,Mon Apr 27 00:55:40 2015 UTC,"Good to know it's not just me! I'm using their SPF 50+ at the moment, so it's just so runny, it feels odd. I prefer the thicker consistency of the Renew 30+, but I figure I'll use this up first. I like their night moisturiser as well (though not HG status), so I'm going to give this Nivea night creme a shot."

It's really low irritant and I haven't reacted once, even when I've used it immediately after applying an AHA!  It's got a moisteriser-like consistency, which I've used under my usual moisteriser with no issues, such as pilling or even feeling heavy.   I noticed a real change in my skin in the first two weeks - particularly in relation to my light pimples, which have cleared away since using it!"

It covers the darkness under my eyes like nothing else. It's the perfect shade for my face and blends in with my foundation. It's liquidy, but it dries just enough to set and not crease all day. I absolutely love it. Real Techniques Expert Face Brush - If you like light-reflecting, dewy looking makeup, this is the brush. It buffs my foundation in so well, it looks like I am wearing almost nothing, yet doesn't compromise on coverage. I always used to use a stippling brush for my base, but it's been cast aside in favour of this. I will say that it uses a fair bit of product, but in saying that my base never looks like 'too much'."
AustralianMakeup,33wv1g,amyeh,1 point,Mon Apr 27 02:48:52 2015 UTC,"Let's talk holy grails! cracks knuckles  As lipstick is my area of expertise, I have the most holy-grails in that area, and most of them are products I have actually finished (gasp), replaced (gasp gasp) or see myself finishing (which, for me, is a big thing). My HGs in other areas are all products I have repurchased, at least once but often multiple times.  Skincare:    QED Skincare Shake to Activate Clarifying Cleanser - I've been using this cleanser for about four years? It's my summer cleanser, for when my skin is oily and pimply (as opposed to dry and pimply in winter). It's super refreshing and clarifying and lovely. The Face Shop Green Tea Waterfull Serum - I use this as a toner and it's super soothing on my easily irritated skin; it has more of a focus on soothing rather than ""tightening"", a la Western toners. Simple Kind to Skin Light Moisturiser - light enough to not make me greasy, but with enough moisturising oomph to give me proper nourishment Bioderma Micellar Water - I bought this for cheap in France and I've tried the alternatives and they're just not as good. The smallest bottle has lasted me almost a year now despite regular use, and it's gentle enough that it doesn't irritate my eyes at all (whereas the Garnier one does a little bit)   Makeup:   Maybelline Full'n'Soft Waterproof mascara - natural looking, full lashes that hold a curl all day Rimmel Stay Matte Powder - Needs reapplication fairly regularly but gives an extra boost to foundation and stops me looking like a greasy alien Daiso Pen Eyeliner - can never find this in stock but when I do, buy in bulk - $2.80 each! Lasts forever without drying out, does the job on the lids Revlon Colorstay Eyebrow Pencil - it has a spoolie on one end and a pencil that never seems to run out on the other. Shade range is limited but I match perfectly and I adore it for filling in sparseness Garnier Oil Free BB Cream - During the winter I prefer fuller coverage but for summer ease of cover and go, this stuff is lightweight and comfy and light coverage but still gives a level of blurring or something that makes my skin look rad Bebe young care lip balms - my friend in Austria brings these for me whenever she visits. I don't know what it is about them that makes them so great, but they just sink in nicely and feel so much more moisturising than almost every other stick lip balm I've tried   Lipstick:   Mac Russian Red - basically my perfect everyday red. The only red lipstick I have ever got a second tube of. Rimmel Kate Moss Lasting Finish Matte lipstick in 107 - deep berry red, absolutely gorgeous, favourite winter lipstick, my tube is down to a nub Chi Chi Viva La Diva Matte lipstick in Corporate Femme - I'm a dark red devotee and this is the stuff of dreams. Beautiful, rich, deep dark colour that isn't too blue or too yellow Revlon Colorburst Matte Balm in Sultry - my throw-on for a ""no makeup"" day staple Fyrinnae liquid matte lipsticks - basically all of them? The formula is decently long wearing, feels comfortable, looks beautiful. My favourites, that I see myself using up (or have already used more than half of, oops) are Naughty & Nice (brick red with micro shimmer for a metallic-y finish), Vixen (dark dark vampy red without berry tones), Interstellar (perfect matte black) and Grafitti (medium blue with shimmer) Flormar Longlasting Lipstick in L05 - Amazingly neon demi-matte pink, desperately seeking a place to buy this online because it's a European purchase and I'm running it right down Pretty Zombie Cosmetics 3 Witches - just a beautiful, beautiful blue toned deep purple in a finish that I love - liquid matte, but comfy (runner up is Potion #9, the perfect blue lavender) NARS Audacious Lipstick in Rita - the comfiest, most luxurious feeling formula I've ever tried Insomnia Cosmetics Witch Hunt and Cult Insomnia - beautiful colours in a wonderful semi-matte finish. Witch Hunt is a berry red and Cult Insomnia is a slate grey, think Melt Spacecake but less uncomfortable Fierce Magenta Midnight Sky - beautiful, super creamy deep blue, sold in lovely slimline tubes"

AustralianMakeup,33wv1g,Artemisian11,1 point,Tue Apr 28 11:22:26 2015 UTC,"I'm still trying to find my perfect winter cleanser! I've had varying degrees of success. I was using the Simple Moisturising Face Wash for a while which worked okay and didn't irritate me, being quite sensitive, but I never properly loved it. At the moment I'm using a Mario Badescu Enzyme Cleansing gel because as long as it's not stripping my skin or flaring up sensitives, I prefer to get a good deep cleanse and then focus on treating my acne as a separate issue through masks and treatments, and putting plenty of moisture back in. I use the Simple moisturiser in the morning, because it's still light enough but packs in some moisture without changing how my makeup sits (it might not be sufficient as my skin continues to get drier), and at night I'm currently using the Origins Make a Difference Night cream - my mother was using it but gave it to me to try, and I'm really liking it so I might have to repurchase. I try to use a gentle exfoliant, something with an agent like jojoba beads, to stop flakiness, and go for targeted masks to purify (I'm currently using QED Skincare's Verte mask).   I'm still adjusting - I'm pretty fresh out of puberty, where my skin was pretty oily all year through, and I used to not have any sensitivity issues, but for the last year or so I've started to really understand how my skin responds to seasons, and sadly the spots that seem to want to stick through it. Definitely ask for those with longer experience on the dry and pimply side of things, because I'm still learning the ropes!"
AustralianMakeup,33wv1g,sarkata,1 point,Tue Apr 28 12:03:58 2015 UTC,"Definitely good to hear someone else's experience! I have eczema on my face, and it likes to flare up into full on flakiness and itching in winter, so physical exfoliation doesn't tend to go well for me. I'm sticking with shitloads of moisturiser + PC's Sensitive cleanser in the morning + OCM at night, with the occasional BHA exfoliant.  /sigh ... one day, one day I'll have stable and happy skin :("

AustralianMakeup,33whfv,WarlockPanda,2,Sun Apr 26 08:50:25 2015 UTC,I actually have tried Miss Nicole and wasn't overly impressed with the longevity but I think I've slowly been getting more forgiving of my shorter wearing products (I'm actually wearing glosses now!) so I may have to just give it a try :)
AustralianMakeup,33whfv,WarlockPanda,1 point,Sun Apr 26 08:56:30 2015 UTC,I'm a little sad that I couldn't really see the sparkle in the two with glitter. Do they have a noticeable shimmer at all? I love the smell of these lipsticks.

AustralianMakeup,33x341,jamballdonut,1 point,Mon Apr 27 02:42:06 2015 UTC,"I have it, for the price you can't go wrong really! It doesn't seem to last/work quite as well on me as fluffnut has experienced (I much prefer the Australis Ready Set Go loose finishing powder) but it's so great to just keep on hand for touch ups etc the only problem I've had so far is that it's very fragile and the pressed powder itself will break/crack/fall apart pretty easily. Once I hit pan on mine, it became even more fragile - every time I even barely graze it with a brush little pieces crumble and come loose and fall all over my lap so I am just careful to open it over a sink or bin in case any fall out now and gently remove and big chunks before I put it away.  But again, honestly for the $5-6 it cost me losing a couple of small chunks here and there is not much of a loss! :)"

AustralianMakeup,33woaq,neccessarygirl,6,Sun Apr 26 09:58:25 2015 UTC,Iherb seem to be great for real techniques brushes and ELF but I'm yet to do an order - hoping they go 20% off again so I can place an order so regret not last time.  I've ordered direct from sigma for brushes and that was fine. Better price than the resellers given the exchange rate at the time and discount codes.  I odered the lorac mega pro and one of the lorac sets of Amazon - I got caught up in the shit packaging of the mega pro the first time round but being in Oz worked out because by the time I got it they had restocked and I was able to exchange - would still recommend Amazon for the Lorac (just be careful for third party resellers rather than direct Amazon)
AustralianMakeup,33woaq,hez_lea,4,Sun Apr 26 12:24:58 2015 UTC,"I have used iherb.com a few times. Their delivery is quite quick,  usually faster than what you are told it will be. And everything is well packed."
AustralianMakeup,33woaq,Admiral_to_you,2,Sun Apr 26 22:37:19 2015 UTC,"I've only ordered supplements and skincare products, not makeup, from iherb, but my experiences have been good. Reasonable pricing with quick and affordable international postage. Items are well sealed and packaged too."
AustralianMakeup,33woaq,goofygooberrock,2,Mon Apr 27 03:26:31 2015 UTC,"iHerb is great! I've ordered from them 4 times over the last year or so, each time things have arrived quickly and well packaged in an appropriate sized box with bubble wrap and air bag thingys.  There's a referral code discount thread on the sidebar of /r/AusSkincare for a discount on your first order. Shipping is now free if you order over $40US (about $52AUD last time I ordered) and usually takes 2 weeks.  I've ordered ELF and Eco Tools from them and it's much cheaper than KMart/Big W etc. They also stock Real Techniques and Physician's Formula, at around half the price of Priceline.  I actually found them when looking for vitamins, only adding makeup as an afterthought. I got a 2 year supply of 5000IU Vitamin D for the same price as buying 3 months worth in Australia. In my last order I even got gluten free pasta, because I couldn't find macaroni/elbow pasta anywhere in Australia!"
AustralianMakeup,33woaq,xenomorphic_acid,5,Mon Apr 27 06:31:29 2015 UTC,"iHerb - see my other comment for how much I love iHerb..haha.  eBay - mostly for single things like nail polish or my HG avon mascara, because it's easier and cheaper when buying one or two things. I would be careful with certain brands, particularly the pricier ones you mentioned, because of fakes. I've also recently bought storage/organising stuff from ebay.  AliExpress - nail polish, nail art, makeup storage. This is for Asian import stuff, similar to the stuff on ebay but cheaper. Look at the reviews and feedback, I don't buy from new sellers, and be aware that it will probably take a while to be shipped. A while ago I placed 4 orders with different sellers (not just makeup related, got my tablet case as well) and the transit times have been 10 days, 21 days, and still waiting on the last two.  Roseroseshop - Korean cosmetics. I've only ordered from here once, but my order was well packaged and didn't take too long.  YesStyle - Korean cosmetics, samples of western mid-high range. Well packaged, arrived quickly. They tend to be a bit more expensive than other stores I think, but they have free shipping over $25 so it's good if you only want a couple of things. Again I've only ordered from here once, I wanted to try samples of Skin79 BB cream and they had a nice sample pack. To get free shipping, I also got a mystery sample box which had a makeup bag (a mens one lol) Lancome, Dior, Chanel, Clairns samples, and a deluxe sample of the Estee Lauder lip conditioner which was worth the price just for that alone.  Mecca - I haven't ordered yet, but I sent them a message through their site asking for help with foundation samples, and a lovely girl called me back and she was so amazing. She asked lots of questions and then put together a pack of samples, I was totally willing to pay for postage at least, but they sent them to me for free. I'm still working through the samples trying to figure out what matches, but I'll definitely be buying foundation from Mecca once I know what I want. Shipping is free over $75, as it should be...it's not hard to reach that with how expensive everything is.  LA Splash - Crazy coloured liquid lipstick. My order hasn't arrived yet, but so far the experience has been great. Normally shipping is $27.95 but they ran a $10 promo recently so I jumped at the chance. They posted pretty quick despite the sale, and it's still been sent priority with delivery confirmation and tracking.  Eccentric Cosmetics - Australian indie makeup brand. Recently got a couple of primer samples, and there were 2 eyeshadow samples thrown in for free. I mentioned that I'd found the store via reddit, and the owner included a handwritten message it was really sweet! I'll definitely be ordering from her again, and I'll post a review soon.  Various other indie stores - Indie makeup is tricky...I got into it really hardcore a few years ago but lost interest in makeup completely (for unrelated reasons) and only recently got back into it. The industry has improved a lot in that time, but it's certainly not matured yet. Definitely read reviews before spending any money. Also be aware that if you find a HG product it may get discontinued even quicker than mainstream brands. /r/Indiemakeupandmore is a good resource if you're interested. Beauty Bohemia is an Australian online store that sells various indie brands, free shipping over $25.  /r/AussieMakeupExchange - Great place to buy things you're not sure about and just want to try, and help others get rid of things cluttering their makeup collections! There's also /r/makeupexchange for international stuff, and I see people posting requests all the time. I actually had a very kind US redditor offer to pick me up something from the Sephora sale and forward it, after seeing a comment I made in MUA whining about not having a Sephora. I couldn't afford to take her up on it at the time, but people are very friendly so I wouldn't hesitate to make a post asking for help.  asos - I've bought clothing many times and had a good experience so if they end up giving the best deal I'd definitely order makeup from them.  Lastly (sorry for the novel!) I have heard good things about bluescandal (NYX, Milani etc) and Sleek's own online store. They are on my list for the future."
AustralianMakeup,33woaq,xenomorphic_acid,6,Mon Apr 27 07:31:43 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry. I got a bit carried away, so this is kinda long ><  These are the 3 main places I order from, although UO is less appealing than it used to be given how bad the AU$ is :( I haven't tried Beauty Bay yet for the same reason (Mecca is pretty good value at the moment... if only it had sales).  Mecca    Brands available: Nars/Hourglass/Stila/UD etc. Shipping time: It arrived less than 36 hours after I ordered it! Shipping cost: $10, or free for an order of $75 or more. Packaging: Really well packaged with tissue paper around the individually boxed items and then in a larger postal box. No room for items to bump around. Sales: Basically never. Free Samples: Yep! Three free. They only had skin care samples available, however.   Luxola   Brands available: Sleek, Zoeva, Wet'n'Wild were the brands I ordered from, but they have quite few more than that. Shipping time: 3 days after ordering Shipping cost: $10-ish, or free for an order of $40 or more. Packaging: Very securely packaged. Bubble wrap bag and all the items individually bubble wrapped, or a few bubble wrapped together for smaller items. Sales: all the time! I bought my stuff during a 30% site-wide flash sale. Free Samples: Yes, 2, but there was no choice.   Urban Outfitters   Brands: Anastasia, Stila, NYX, Beauty Blender, The Balm, Sigma Brushes and more Shipping time: 5ish weeks, from memory. Shipping cost: $10, or free for an order of $50 or more. Packaging: Not the best. Lots of space around items so they bumped around/could have gotten broken.  Sales: Quite often! Free Samples: Note for either of the orders I did."

AustralianMakeup,33woaq,I_See_the_Eye_Sea,2,Mon Apr 27 00:46:21 2015 UTC,"I own a set of Zoeva brushes and I absolutely adore them - super soft, nice range of densities and decently priced for their quality compared to Sigma or MAC. I got the first rose gold set (they now have a second one out) and it even came with a beautiful leather matching bag. I don't know the exact names of the ones I have, but there's a range of face, eyeshadow and brow brushes and I have nothing but good things to say about all of them.  The only downfall was I ordered direct from the site and since they're based in Germany (or somewhere near) it took over a month to get here. Luxola might be faster!"

AustralianMakeup,33woaq,Jessijames,2,Sun Apr 26 12:46:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, I don't know how I did makeup at all before getting these brushes.

Benefit is generally cheaper to buy on their online international store but shipping does take a while, although it's worth the wait because you'll be able to get pretty much double the amount of products than you would here for the same price (and they have free shipping deals for orders over $125 I think and have promos where it's a lower limit to get free shipping)."

I really do recommend Mecca - I've had terrific service there, they seem to know their products, and I love their neat tester set-up. And having a rewards program is nice!"

They ship fast, are decently priced given the current exchange rate, have excellent customer service, a rewards program,  and a very good return policy. Plus you're supporting an Australian brand :)"
AustralianMakeup,33woaq,deluxecreampuff,5,Sun Apr 26 12:00:28 2015 UTC,Plus online orders give 3 free samples! You don't get that with many other stores.
AustralianMakeup,33woaq,oncchi,2,Mon Apr 27 00:42:49 2015 UTC,"Definitely recommend ordering online from Mecca - super fast postage whereas BeautyBay is on the slow side. I think I waited about two-and-a-bit weeks for my order. That said, BeautyBay is fine - no complaints other than the slowish post."

Pretty sure the up to 20% off sale is still running, so maybe check that out for the brands you want?   Other sites include strawberry net and UO, also sites I've never had problems with, but out of the three I'd probably recommend BB. Good luck with it!"

They stock Anastasia, Hourglass, Illamasqua and a bunch of other brands and the prices are pretty decent too ($15 for dip brow, ~$5 less than Mecca for Hourglass), so you should check them out too :)"
AustralianMakeup,33woaq,StrattonLove,1 point,Mon Apr 27 06:53:21 2015 UTC,"For the cheaper brands you mentioned I use either Luxola or crushcosmetics.com.au, depending on who has what I want in stock and the cheapest. I've not seen Crush Cosmetics mentioned here before, but all my experiences with them have been positive. Fast shipping and well packed, the one time I got something that was broken they resent it with no fuss or proof required."
AustralianMakeup,33woaq,senkidala,1 point,Tue Apr 28 06:30:23 2015 UTC,"I don't buy a lot of pricier makeup online because I can access Mecca easily (being in Sydney) and Mecca's prices are reasonable now that currency rate isn't that great. I don't take notice of how long it takes to get your package but I'd say most of the sites I've used were pretty standard in shipping time, unless I say something else about it.  Sites I've used:   iHerb: I've only ever purchased a hair brush from them but they're good for brushes (as the others have said). Shipping prices are good. Fast shipping. I was surprised because it was around Christmas time when I bought from them and we all know how sluggish post is on Christmas. Strawberrynet: I never had any trouble from them. I bought from them twice but I don't think the deals are that great, unless they have further discounts. Free shipping on cosmetics. BeautyBay: You got to watch what you want because sometimes you'll end up paying more than what they charge here. I bought from them recently and I haven't received my package but everything's efficient and free shipping above $20 is great. I got a Stila eyeshadow palette for a great deal but I looked at Urban Decay and it's cheaper in Mecca. (I only bought Stila.) Sleek: I used the official website. Shipping is good. Perhaps in the past, it was outrageously expensive but they've got cheaper shipping. If you want to get a number of Sleek products, get it from their website. Kiss and Makeup: I used this website once when the AUD was good. It's got a US$9.95 shipping flat rate so great for big purchases but I only bought two NARS lipsticks from them. Both were new stock and authentic. They also stock Kiehls, Laura Mercier, Trish McEvoy and Smashbox among other brands. ASOS: I've bought from them a few times for accessories but only once for cosmetics. They stocked Illamasqua and I bought a lipstick. I paid a little bit more for it than if I were to go over to the Illamasqua counter... but that was my mistake.    As for shipping forwarding sites, I've used shipito once just to see how things go. It wasn't for cosmetics -- I got some jewellery from Baublebar (which offer international shipping, so if anything were to go wrong, I could make my purchase again). Shipping from shipito cost just as much as Baublebar charged for international shipping... but I didn't pick the cheapest option (average shipping time for the cheapest option was 3 months). If you are after products that aren't accessible here and if you plan to get a huge box full of products, it's worth it. Otherwise, it is not. Shipito is reliable -- I got my package safe and sound and they held onto the package for a little while (I wanted it by Christmas).  The problem I had with it was that you had to authenticate your account with a lot of personal information before you can get your package. It's not their fault, it's the USPS 1583. Oh, and some websites won't deliver to these forwarding companies so you have to check."

AustralianMakeup,33rk5k,flickkaa,4,Fri Apr 24 23:03:48 2015 UTC,Have you tried the Covergirl outlast stay fabulous foundation? It controls oil fairly well (still have to blot twice a day though) and lasts for 10 hours on my combo skin. Medium coverage with one layer that's buildable to full. Most of the shades available are pink-undertoned. I don't know how light your skin shade is but might be worth checking it out.
AustralianMakeup,33rk5k,Joolebear,1 point,Sat Apr 25 00:27:46 2015 UTC,"Second this! Forgot I had it in my stash. Not a bad option although I get frustrated because the colour options I've tried tend to make my skin look a sallow, probably because I lean towards more yellow-based foundations."

It's amazeballs at oil control, especially when paired with a mattifying powder (I used Maybelline's Dream Matte, now discontinued).

AustralianMakeup,33rk5k,missb00,1 point,Sat Apr 25 02:00:30 2015 UTC,Was just going to recommend this. It's a bit useless without a good primer but with one it's fantastic.
AustralianMakeup,33rk5k,pootlepower,2,Sat Apr 25 04:03:12 2015 UTC,"I gave up on foundations as they all hate me and my shitty oily skin and instead I use Skin79 BB cream in hot pink. Primer and setting sprays also play a huge part. Currently I am using a combo of Skindinavia oil control setting spray, Hourglass Mineral Veil primer, Too Faced Poreless primer in oil free, Skin79 BB in hot pink and Rimmel Stay Matte powder. I also started drinking 2-3L of water a day, which also seems to be helping. I've gone from a crazy oil slick and having to blot pretty much hourly to only getting a slight shine on my nose towards the end of the day. It's been a very nice change."
AustralianMakeup,33rk5k,Tickle_Me_Tortoise,1 point,Fri Apr 24 23:28:18 2015 UTC,"I have been finding the uber silicone primers seem to make my oil worse even if they are supposed to be matifying (though I'm still to try the rimmel one) the faces of australia one in the purple tube has been good. Doesn't give that slick feel to your face but it means the oil is the only slick thing rather than seeming to double.   As far as foundation goes I found doublewear the longest wearing but not a great colour match (am going to have to try another colour, the one I got matched with is to yellow and she wanted me to try a more yellow one!) so maybe we have different chemistry. ChiChi does a good job for me too - I used the #3 they advise of their undertones on their packaging which is soooo helpful means your less tricked by shop lighting. At the moment its basically impossible to get a hold of because they are launching a reformulated version soon so have been marked down, but otherwise are in Myer and target.   My oily skin though has been a lot more manageable since I got my clarisonic. There was even a huge improvement when I was using my cheapy Olay face cleaner thing and it's made a huge improvement to my foundation wear. Hope that helps!"

They'll be too dark if you're above an NC/NW20 in MAC but they set matte and stay put reasonably well.   Ignore this paragraph if you're not within travelling distance of Sydney, but I also use Sephora's 10hr wear foundation which is pretty decent. You will need to apply heavily to get maximum coverage though. Not quite as mattifying (is that a word?) as Benefit but holds up pretty well throughout the day.  Urban Decay's Naked Skin (can be bought online or at Mecca Maxima) is pretty good, not sure how it holds up over a whole day though. They have the same issue as Benefit though, if you're very pale they will be too dark for you. They do accomodate for pink/yellow/neutral undertones."

Have you considered switching up or trying other primers to see if they help with the oil control? I think someone's mentioned it already but hourglass veil mineral primer is a really good primer for helping your foundation last all day and it also helps with oil control. There's been heaps of really good recommendations for foundations already but i'll just add that hourglass immaculate is incredible with super oily skin. It's a liquid to powder foundation which dries to a matte finish, with suuuuper long wear, full coverage and is actually water resistant (almost waterproof). you do have to make sure your skin is well prepped and primed before because the application can be a bit thick if you're not careful. but once blended out, you will look flawless and you will not have to worry about any oil breaking down your makeup through the day. it's so good with oil control that it's actually recommended you skip powder with this one! ahaha great thing about both these products is that you can grab samples of them from any mecca maxima/cosmetica so you can try to see if you like them before you commit :)"
AustralianMakeup,33rk5k,elfies_,1 point,Sat Apr 25 09:30:48 2015 UTC,Wow thanks! I started to think about my primer when I posted this.

AustralianMakeup,33obfa,Kotetsu,1 point,Sat Apr 25 05:58:56 2015 UTC,"Hey, I actually just bought two of them yesterday and from first impressions really like them! I bought them after seeing them on Emily Noel's ""Emily Awards"" twice in a row on youtube... She's an amazing youtube beauty blogger, and her Emily Awards are pretty much her annual awards for best product in each different category.  They're really easy to apply and blend like a dream using only my fingers. They have a very smooth, almost silicone-like texture. I can't say much about the lasting power though, since I only tried to use them today... haha  Hope I was a little bit of a help!  Edit/If you want more information, she's got a nice review on youtube just on these blushes!"

AustralianMakeup,33n9ns,Jessijames,4,Thu Apr 23 22:18:36 2015 UTC,"I ran out of time at the last minute this morning because I forgot I had to get petrol on my way in to work -.- duh. So I had my foundation & powder etc on and was just starting my eyes when I realised and proceeded to slap the rest on and hope for the best. Ain't nobody in my house have time for eyebrows today!  What is your one thing you can live without doing when you're in a rush? To be fair, I'm someone who usually wears a full face to work every day rather than just a base with mascara etc but if I need to skip something, brows are the top of that list. They're a chore for me ha  Product list:   Skindinavia Oil Control primer Spray Maybelline Dream Mousse Smooth Primer Revlon Colourstay combo/oily foundation in Ivory (110?) Too Faced Milk Chocolate Soleil & The Balm Mary Loumanizer for contour/highlight MAC The Simpsons LE blush in Sideshow You Eyes have MAC painterly Paint Pot as the base, with Omega in the crease, L’Oreal Infallible Eyeshadow in Iced Latte (the uber fluffy almost cream ones) all over the lid Urban Decay 24/7 liner in Perversion (I think, one of the black ones!) & Essence Maximum Definition Mascara Lime Crime Velvetine in Cashmere   Before anyone jumps on me for the Lime Crime, don't worry I know all about the happenings. In about Dec my housemate wanted to grab some Velvetines from their website (who was blissfully unaware about them as a company) so I said what the heck and grabbed a couple too. I knew a little about their past etc but knew there were plenty of other companies with just as shady pasts, and had heard great things about the products themselves.  I made the purchase for us, and I was caught up in the information breach. Luckily, I had used my Paypal and not a credit card otherwise I would have been royally screwed - even more fortunately, I use a very different and much more secure password for my Paypal which meant it stayed safe and whoever took the info from Lime Crime was unable to gain access. THIS people is why I ALWAYS pay with paypal. It does creep me out that somebody somewhere in the world has my personal address/full name etc though.  Despite the bullshit, I have spent the money on it and I'm damn well going to use it up and never buy Lime Crime again. The huge bummer to all of this? The formula of the Velvetines kicks the absolute shiiieet out of the Australis Velour Lips, I mean...I HATE using my Velour Lips now because they don't even compare. & I'm coveting the Venus palette like a MOFO but have been looking into all the great Inglot dupes. Fuck those guys."
AustralianMakeup,33n9ns,elaboratekicks,1 point,Thu Apr 23 22:31:11 2015 UTC,I know how you feel. I have not been able to find a forumla that even comes close to that of Velvetines. So I'm going keep wearing them. I feel bad but at the end of the day the product is good.
AustralianMakeup,33n9ns,pootlepower,2,Thu Apr 23 22:51:44 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I am going to grab some of the Kat Von D & ABH ones when I next do a haul from the US to give them a whirl. The Velvetines just feel so damn lightweight, they're not drying at all and dry completely - I find the velour lips still stay a little tacky even with light & careful application, which makes them pull and bunch up after a few hours. My Velvetines are always flawless at 5pm when I walk in the door from a full day at work -.-"
AustralianMakeup,33n9ns,pootlepower,1 point,Thu Apr 23 22:56:59 2015 UTC,Hey just a heads up on those velvetines: I recall seeing a post on MUA a while ago about how they have an ingredient that is safe for eyes but not safe for lips. A few people who wore it every day were reporting getting sores on their lips that their doctors attributed to this ingredient. Can't for the life of me remember what it was called and am looking for the thread. IIRC they were saying it's fine for occasional wear but those who are sensitive should avoid using it every day.
AustralianMakeup,33n9ns,pumpkinspicevodka,1 point,Fri Apr 24 05:00:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I remember reading that post - I've been careful to only wear Cashmere maybe once every few weeks just to be on the safe side and so far no problems but yes - thank you for remembering that!   I also remember a few comments at another stage saying that they think LC removed the ingredient from the listing and had supposedly removed it from the product as well but the ingredient remained on the list on the packaging - it IS LC so they could be lying through their teeth if I am remembering this correctly but as far as I have heard they did remove the ingredient some time recently but I would rather be safe than sorry anyway!"

The mineralize blue formula is heaven to me.   I've tried the studio fix fluid, the shade was a great match, formula was okay but not one of the best I've tried. Didn't control oil as well as had heard, was a little cakey if not applied just right and would go a little patchy throughout the day for me.   I  have the mineralize SF in Lightscapade and love it, again it's fast become my go to highlight!"

AustralianMakeup,33ki78,Jessijames,1 point,Fri Apr 24 04:19:29 2015 UTC,"The regular ones are all shimmer IIRC, they're mor of a highlighter or a blush if you're fair and choose a darker shade. They have a version called skinfinish natural that are more like a baked/pressed powder with a small amount of coverage though so maybe check those out instead? Although I think they're matte with a small hint of shimmer probably a little closer to the Hourglass ALP's but in skintones if that makes sense?"
AustralianMakeup,33ki78,WarlockPanda,1 point,Fri Apr 24 04:24:44 2015 UTC,"I'm with /u/jessijames on the warm soul blush. It is great for a light  bit of colour on a more toned down day, but it is also fantastic for layering with other blushes for more depth. However I haven't personally tried the other products on your list so I can't really comment on those. You should definitely go in store and ask to try out the products. I would recommend getting a sample of the foundation before purchasing so you don't waste your gift card on a foundation that doesn't work for you."

AustralianMakeup,33jq9u,superfembot77,5,Thu Apr 23 01:56:24 2015 UTC,"Pale girl here, I'm terrible at explaining but I'll try and explain how I do mine. I use a brush like this, and don't have much product on the brush. I apply it rightly lightly and build the product up. If I make a mistake I'll apply more foundation powder to blend it down. I contour under my cheekbones and blend it up so I get that distinct line. On my temples and on my hairline, and sometimes under my jaw. With highlighting I try and apply as little as possible, because the products I have are so pigmented. Same with blush, as little as possible otherwise I think it looks to busy."
AustralianMakeup,33jq9u,Crumpet92,1 point,Thu Apr 23 02:28:39 2015 UTC,Well I'm using the right brush.. Maybe I'll use much less product next time..
AustralianMakeup,33jq9u,Mompy,4,Thu Apr 23 02:36:48 2015 UTC,"I basically dab my brush on my chosen colour once very lightly, and then tap/blow off the colour. For pale skin you'll want to be using the coolest tone (the middle colour in the pallet) rather than the lightest. The warmer toned, light colour will look too orange for a pale person.  You should start practicing with an amount that is unnoticeable on your skin, and then try larger amounts until you are happy with the results. The pigmentation of that pallet is ridiculously good, to the point of difficulty."
AustralianMakeup,33jq9u,Crumpet92,2,Thu Apr 23 09:53:11 2015 UTC,"I saw the comment about the palette being warm toned, thought I'd share what I use. Either Too Faced - Matte Bronzer in milk chocolate, it's the lightest shade they offer. Or the Anastasia Beverly Hills Contour palette. I use the shade NC15 in MAC for my foundation for reference to show how pale I am."
AustralianMakeup,33jq9u,lush1984,2,Thu Apr 23 04:24:32 2015 UTC,"I use AC on Tour in my professional kit. I have found that even on white Aussie girls, it's too dark going from the pan. On a contour brush, I tend to stick with the middle brown shade, I'll load the brush up and then flick it off on the back of my hand. It insures that I'm only applying a little bit. I also go in with a light hand. I hardly have to blend it doing that way.  I do get brown powdered hands by the end of the job :-/"
AustralianMakeup,33jq9u,jen-iscool,2,Thu Apr 23 05:33:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah that what I do as well! Or I dap a little on my dressing gown, it's so dirty now haha I find it so much easier only putting the tiniest bit on at a time :)"
AustralianMakeup,33jq9u,Joolebear,5,Thu Apr 23 23:21:54 2015 UTC,"The contour kit is actually quite warm and pigmented so I wouldn't have recommended it for your pale skin especially if you're cool-toned. I'm in the shade NC20-25 (NC25 is considered towards medium skin tone) and I barely pull it off with a very fluffy moderately dense powder brush. I use the powder brush from Faboosh's original brush set (the white one, now discontinued) but the Real Technique's powder brush works too. I literally tap the brush LIGHTLY once into the rightmost contour shade, tap off excess, brush a bit onto the back of my hand and use a light hand to place it just on my cheekbones and buff lightly.   You might benefit from a more grey-toned contour shade like Nyx Taupe or Illamasqua's Hollow. If you can't make the Australis palette work for contouring, it's at least good as brow powder for warm-toned hair and the shimmery highlight is lovely too."
AustralianMakeup,33jq9u,redkoala,1 point,Thu Apr 23 02:30:54 2015 UTC,"Hmm, maybe that's where the problem lies.. I'll look into the NYX palette I think"

The individual Chi Chi palettes might not have the same range of finishes or consistent eyeshadow quality as say UD's Naked*, but considering you can get 3 Chi Chi palettes (= 36 shadows) for the price of Naked at Mecca Maxima, I think its really good value for money!  * I have heard the Chi Chi Nudes is a good 'cheap' dupe for Naked"
AustralianMakeup,33dkci,WarlockPanda,2,Wed Apr 22 02:50:05 2015 UTC,"I have the bases palette and I love it so much, the pigmentation is wonderful and the uses are endless. Coming from someone who used mainly dark coloured until recently (what can I say? I was an emo tween) it has really help me bring more light into my looks."
AustralianMakeup,33dkci,Jessijames,2,Wed Apr 22 09:53:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the review. I personally have really enjoyed the Mattes palette since I got it for exactly the same reasons. There are a lot of great transition shades which assist in blending and some great highlight shades. I do find some of the colors are a little harder to work with and I do wish they has some more lighter colours within the palette. There are so many dark shades. I was thinking of doing swatches of my elegant, classics and bases palette sometime."
AustralianMakeup,33dkci,WarlockPanda,3,Tue Apr 21 23:00:35 2015 UTC,"I am definitely looking at grabbing the mattes palette soon, I am hoping it was stave off my temptation to get the new Kat Von D shade & light eye palette. I have been loving matte eye looks lately and don't really have all that many matte shades, only those scattered around what palettes I own. I figure if I can grab the Chi Chi on sale, it will give me a chance to see if I really will use a fully matte palette enough to justify the KVD one - even though I think the KVD will blow this out of the water...haha It's that or a work at putting together my own Inglot matte palette but the cost of that will probably end up much higher than the KVD."
AustralianMakeup,33dkci,Jessijames,2,Tue Apr 21 23:39:37 2015 UTC,"I'm a sucker for the Inglot matte eyeshadow formula. I have a personalized 10 slot palette I have been adding too overtime (mostly soft pinks, reds and rose colours). Personally the new KVD one does not appeal to me since there is so many yellow/orange tones and I prefer purples/greys like in the Ladybird. The Chi Chi mattes gives a nice mix of colours and tones."
AustralianMakeup,33dkci,MsOrangeCake,3,Tue Apr 21 23:51:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, the Inglot matte formula is fantastic, and I already have a few neutral mattes in my 20-slot palette that's been full for a while now.  I'm thinking of picking up a new 10-slot, transferring those matte shades as a start and working on building it up with more mattes as I figure out what I want/like. The more I think about it, the more value the Inglot might have because of the customisation (duh, I know right) - The swatches of the Kat Von D are what is really drawing me in and those really warm almost orangey tones are what I am really lusting after but I am sure I could dupe a lot of it at Inglot!"
AustralianMakeup,33dkci,goofygooberrock,1 point,Wed Apr 22 00:00:06 2015 UTC,"I'm yet to try any of the palettes on my eyes, so thanks for the heads up about the Mattes palette workabilty (that's not even a word, but idc, you know what I mean). I would definitely love to see more Chi Chi palette swatches! The mauves, plums and rose tones of the Elegant palette look lovely!"

The only one I share with you is Rich Gems and it's probably the one I use the least, but looking at your swatches has got me wanting to use it a bit more as some of those colours are so gorgeous! Just a bit harder to come up with day time looks with them. Using them as a foil liner is a great idea though and I might have to try that. =) The other ones I own are the Nudes (decent cheap dupe for UD's Naked 1 as you mentioned) and I recently got the Elegants because those purpley shades were too pretty to resist."

Since I am not sure if there have been any reviews of the service on the sub.  I got someone on MUE to make my purchases :D I'm getting 2 UD revolution lipsticks in Native and Naked2 since they are not bringing that formula to Australia, TF melted metal in Debutante, Clinique cheek pop in Ginger and the Tarte Showstopper palette. This was a ""treat yo-self"" for myself too since I have finally finished my studies. I'm pretty excited about it overall."
AustralianMakeup,33f02z,WarlockPanda,6,Wed Apr 22 00:14:05 2015 UTC,"Congrats on finishing your studies! That definitely deserves a nice haul.   You got such awesome things - for pretty much everything you just listed I said ""ugh why didn't I get that too!"" to myself~  My package just got delivered to the ShopMate place in Oregon and I'm just paying for it to be sent on now. My box weighs a kilo and it's going to cost AUD$36.85 to get to me in 5-8 days which seems fairly reasonable to me. You can store stuff there for up to 2 months but can't consolidate packages which is kinda annoying."
AustralianMakeup,33f02z,missb00,4,Wed Apr 22 01:50:09 2015 UTC,"Ooh, definitely seconding the request for a Shopmate review once it's all done. I'm eager to see how it performs, as I may use it in the future.  Also please let me know how the Cover Drops go! I'd like to grab the palest yellow ones, if they're worth it."
AustralianMakeup,33f02z,missb00,2,Wed Apr 22 04:55:38 2015 UTC,I'm really excited about trying the drops - especially as there was a thread about them in mua today. All I could do was sort of guess my colour so finger crossed it's okay!
AustralianMakeup,33f02z,missb00,3,Wed Apr 22 05:20:44 2015 UTC,"Oh, there was a thread? I'll have to try and find them. Personally I have a few foundations that are a little too pink for me, so I think the lightest yellow drops might be a good addition to my collection."

AustralianMakeup,33f02z,Jessijames,2,Wed Apr 22 07:38:11 2015 UTC,"I spoke with Mecca CS on the phone last week and asked them about it, they said that UD are in the process of reformulating the original Revolution lipsticks, and that once they new formula is released Mecca should be getting it! I called to ask them because I had read on here they were possibly being discontinued (I think you were a part of that discussion? lol) and I has asked in my local store and was told they were simply not getting them at all.  Ginger Pop is the shade I am looking at from that blush range, let me know what you think since our taste is similar! I am currently looking for a standalone cheek colour the same as what is in the Tarte Rainforest After Dark palette, not too pink, not too red, not too dusty, not too brown, just a really nice satin plummy/mauve (which is how that blush pulls on me) and so far the new NARS dual intensity in Fervor has got me hung up!  Also, I have Native and it's the bomb for a nice everyday shade. How much did shipping end up in the end? I wish I could have joined in and split with you :'("
AustralianMakeup,33f02z,Bebbygoose,2,Wed Apr 22 00:54:41 2015 UTC,"I hope the reformulation is good. However, I didn't think there was anything wrong with the original formula anyway, so I'll be happy to add these two to my collection.   I'll definitely be able to let you know about the blush. I honestly think I am super excited about trying it out after seeing the swatches and reviews online. I almost didn't put it on my list.   I haven't finalized shipping yet but I'll let you know what it was once I get it.   I'm pretty happy with what I decided on this time. I spent a lot of time swatching my current collection to try and find dupes, destashing and I magically used up a bunch of products in the last couple of months.   Edit: I'm hoping Native will be what I wanted Snob to be."
AustralianMakeup,33ch0j,pondicus,19,Tue Apr 21 12:12:22 2015 UTC,"I don't understand.  Who is the customer for this product. Who in their right mind, no matter how much money they have, looks at this product and says 'yes, this is a wise purchase'. How did the marketing team arrive at this as a price that people will pay. How much coke was passed around at that meeting. What is the thought process here. So many questions."
AustralianMakeup,33ch0j,pootlepower,6,Tue Apr 21 14:51:55 2015 UTC,"Lifestyle creep, maybe? You start off earning a regular salary, thinking $400+ for a body product is ludicrous.

AustralianMakeup,336col,missb00,3,Mon Apr 20 08:20:11 2015 UTC,"Just thinking about ways you can avoid getting stuck in the future... I used to organise group orders a few years ago (BPAL, Lush, nail polish, that sort of thing) and I usually collected the money in two rounds. First was before the order I'd get everyone to send $US for the products they wanted, and use that to pay for the order, which avoided being short due to currency fluctuation. Then once everything arrived, I'd work out exactly how much the shipping split was (per person, $value, or weight) and add that to the local shipping which I was able to calculate exactly with the products on hand to weigh once packed, and people would pay in $AUD for less fees (or bank deposit)  People would flake out before the order was placed, but it didn't matter because the rules were simple, no payment, no order. I'd get people jumping in at the last minute too, which was easy to handle as all I needed was their shopping list and PayPal payment. Then when the order actually arrived, I was able to accurately and fairly divide shipping between the people who actually ended up participating.  I did have to have the cash to cover all of the order shipping myself up front, but I got it back when the order arrived. I suppose if someone neglected to pay at that point I would be in the negative for their shipping split, but given that they had paid for the products, I never had anyone flake on the second payment!  Anyway, that approach might not be the best way to do it, particularly for letter mail instead of parcels, but something to consider?"
AustralianMakeup,336col,missb00,2,Mon Apr 20 08:53:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'll definitely be considering trying something this way around in future. One of the early ones I did I tried it this way but I found a lot of people wanted to know the shipping price 'up front' before deciding to join or not, and I even had somebody pull out once I gave them a shipping total which is why I decided to just bite the bullet and do it all in one. I'll have to have a think about it all before I get onto another buy! Food for though, thank you!"
AustralianMakeup,336col,missb00,2,Mon Apr 20 10:47:26 2015 UTC,I think that you've set a precedent now and have a reputation for this. It's a bit different to the first time that you suggested it.
AustralianMakeup,336col,missb00,2,Wed Apr 22 07:45:36 2015 UTC,"Sucks that some people can't be bothered to even let you know if they're still interested, etc. Perhaps in addition, next time could be limited to those with mue flair? And maybe we can make group buys count for the flair?   Just an idea because it's horrible to put the organiser of something so wonderful through all this crap :/"
AustralianMakeup,336col,babytigress,7,Mon Apr 20 06:44:26 2015 UTC,"I had considered the option of only people who have MUE flair, but on the other side of the coin I know there's probably a lot of you who have joined in on these over the last however long I've been running them, that don't purchase via MUE, even though they may be quite active/well known around the sub and therefore wouldn't have a flair - so I didn't want to exclude people in that regard.   Also, a lot of people who have joined in on my group buys have also been usernames I've not stumbled across before much around the sub if at all and were a pleasure to work with, so trying to filter who I allow could get pretty gritty. I want to give everyone an equal chance and the benefit of the doubt, so the best course I could think to take was to simply bar people from future buys if they don't co-operate!  Thank you for being one of the good ones boo :)"
AustralianMakeup,336col,Tuipie,1 point,Mon Apr 20 06:49:32 2015 UTC,"Before I read the second paragraph I was thinking maybe combining flair plus past familiar people to create an approved list, but you're right in wanting everyone to have a fair chance - good on you.   Unfortunately I don't think there's a way to stop them all, but banning those who go back should definitely make an improvement.   BTW, were the shipping costs for Fyrinnae messed up? If so I'm happy to cover any increased cost from my end."
AustralianMakeup,336col,Tuipie,1 point,Mon Apr 20 07:10:55 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately the shipping costs for all 3 were affected, thank you for the offer its very kind of you but it's all good. :)"
AustralianMakeup,336col,Tuipie,1 point,Mon Apr 20 07:35:46 2015 UTC,"Are you sure? I'd hate to think you're put out by this, especially since you set it all up. And I don't think you even offered from Fyrinnae yourself did you?"

AustralianMakeup,336col,xenomorphic_acid,1 point,Sat Apr 25 23:03:58 2015 UTC,It hasn't shipped yet no but I don't know if they can adjust orders - I'm not home at the moment but I can look into it when I get back home tonight? :)
AustralianMakeup,336col,xenomorphic_acid,1 point,Sat Apr 25 23:52:49 2015 UTC,LOL I'm enabling everyone. No worries if you can't of course! Might be more hassle than it's worth. They're usually pretty happy to adjust order but the group buy component mixes it up.

AustralianMakeup,330kov,xenomorphic_acid,2,Sat Apr 18 11:19:12 2015 UTC,"Based on their past promos like this (they've done skincare and hair products over the past 12 months) it is definitely the brands that are part of the gift that need to make up the purchase.

AustralianMakeup,330kov,Liraniel,1 point,Sun Apr 19 11:03:52 2015 UTC,Agree totally. Would rather get a Revlon palette or a Rimmel lippy.

AustralianMakeup,330kov,eood,3,Sat Apr 18 10:33:56 2015 UTC,Wow! How does this work? New to Australia... Do I have to be really quick and is it one day only?
AustralianMakeup,330kov,ComingUpMilhouse,2,Sun Apr 19 01:02:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's best to go in as early as possible because they do sell out, I couldn't see the date but its usually one or two days."

AustralianMakeup,330kov,reddit-g,5,Wed Apr 29 22:48:23 2015 UTC,I'm kinda surprised they make the minimum spend on receiving these bags so low… as we all know it isn't hard to spend $60 or more at Priceline.
AustralianMakeup,330kov,TheRealChocolateFrog,7,Sat Apr 18 10:27:55 2015 UTC,"From every one I've got, its just been left over stock from deleted products."
AustralianMakeup,330kov,reddit-g,1 point,Sat Apr 18 12:37:02 2015 UTC,"Ahh I see, so the value isn't necessarily +$200"
AustralianMakeup,330kov,TheRealChocolateFrog,9,Sat Apr 18 22:02:54 2015 UTC,"No it is. Its just the stock they don't have room for on the shelf. Like the hair care bag last time had a conditioner in it I really love, it's been deleted and I can't find it anywhere, including woolies and Coles. It has a lot of stuff you just can't expect to be able to repurchase it."
AustralianMakeup,330kov,reddit-g,1 point,Sat Apr 18 23:37:00 2015 UTC,So it's mostly products they're discontinuing?
AustralianMakeup,330kov,TheRealChocolateFrog,1 point,Sun Apr 19 02:24:30 2015 UTC,Yep. All the left over stock they can't sell.
AustralianMakeup,330kov,Flippantry,2,Sun Apr 19 06:28:32 2015 UTC,"The little pink bag it comes with (I hope?) is really cute!  The past two actual bags themselves have been really garish!  It's much better than the last one that had two foundations/bb creams and a concealer, this one looks a bit more universal.   They're pretty good value but I wouldn't recommend people to go out of their way to get these unless they specifically like some of the products in it or you've got a Priceline wishlist raked up.  They're usually made up of a few good products and some crappy selling ones.  It looks like the Savvy Clear Brow Gel is in there which is pretty cool because that's a relatively new product."
AustralianMakeup,330kov,Babymup,1 point,Sun Apr 19 07:33:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah I recall seeing the last bag and not bothering because I'm warm and pale, so the products in that one would not have suited me at all. I feel like even pale and cool-toned people would have more luck than me in those sorts of things.  However here there's not much that's strictly so personal as base items, so I am kinda excited.  I haven't exactly got a ""list"" but there are a few things I am eager to take a shot at, or re-stock on."
AustralianMakeup,330kov,Flippantry,1 point,Sun Apr 19 07:51:36 2015 UTC,"By the way you can get those bags on ebay for about $10, they're knock off Ted Bakers. Really cute and quite good quality, would recommend."

I mean, they're clearly gorgeous to look at but how do they stack up as a blush - worth the moolah or am I better off with NARS/MAC/Hourglass for the amount of money? I'm a blush fiend, and the temptation is great."
AustralianMakeup,33185z,asteroyale,2,Sun Apr 19 23:44:01 2015 UTC,I have one in Plum Pop and its absolutely amazing. It is quite pigmented and has a creamy texture (meaning it will go on better with fingers but you can use a brush). At $40 it was definitely a splurge for me and I probably wouldn't try to collect every shade (but I really want to omg) but I don't regret purchasing it as the quality of the product is 10/10.
AustralianMakeup,33185z,Jessijames,2,Tue Apr 21 00:50:34 2015 UTC,Exactly what I was not wanting to hear because it's just making me want to buy them more haha Thank you! :)
AustralianMakeup,33185z,elfies_,1 point,Tue Apr 21 01:06:38 2015 UTC,"I would actually recommend these over the blushes from the other brands tbh :3 they're that good (everything above comment said), they're the kind that look so natural and are so easy to use it's very difficult to overdo. All the other brands have both hit/miss blushes in their range. If you were going to invest in blushes these would be the ones. The only downside is the limited range we have available in aus which crossing fingers hopefully will change."

AustralianMakeup,330ghi,ProstheticPeacemaker,5,Sat Apr 18 08:23:16 2015 UTC,"Not offended at all! I can't see well from my right eye, so I don't usually wear eyeshadow and  I've got these specific products because they dont need a lot of effort, and I wanted to try. Using more than one colour is entirely new to me, and I didn't know I wasn't blending it well until you gave me the feedback...now I can totally see it and know what to work on! Thank you very much for the honesty :D"
AustralianMakeup,330ghi,WarlockPanda,2,Sat Apr 18 08:32:33 2015 UTC,"I would imagine it is because both eye products used by OP are not intended for use with a brush, but are supposed to be blended out with a finger."

AustralianMakeup,32vwmx,deluxecreampuff,2,Fri Apr 17 03:42:47 2015 UTC,That is a great desk! I've been after a small desk for my small apartment.    Did you get your clear drawers and drawer inserts from Aliexpress?
AustralianMakeup,32vwmx,assaulted_peanuts,3,Fri Apr 17 05:13:30 2015 UTC,The square three-tiered draws are from Kmart ($9 each); the larger acrylic drawer set I got from Howard's Storage World for around $30 (I think) and the lipstick caddy I think is from HSW but you can get identical ones at Kmart for $9. The draw inserts are all from Kmart: the makeup ones were $5 each and the long ones are actually from the kitchen section and were $4 each. BUT... I was in The Reject Shop today and saw amazing storage boxes in the kitchen section that would have been even better at around $2 apiece so would definitely recommend looking there first if you have a store near you.
AustralianMakeup,32vwmx,assaulted_peanuts,2,Fri Apr 17 05:23:37 2015 UTC,"Oh great, pretty cheap! Thanks for the reply and I shall check out The Reject Shop :)"
AustralianMakeup,32vwmx,DAT_CANKLE,2,Fri Apr 17 05:28:32 2015 UTC,"Just letting you know I have a very similar makeup caddy as OPs with the little brush and lipstick section on top that I got from the Reject Shop! It was about a year ago and was around fifteen dollars, keep an eye out!"

AustralianMakeup,32vwmx,puffandruffle,2,Sun Apr 19 07:56:09 2015 UTC,I bought the exact same desk as my battle station and it's absolutely perfect.
AustralianMakeup,32vwmx,Amielia,1 point,Fri Apr 17 04:44:35 2015 UTC,What sort of lighting are you planning on using? I've just finished setting up my battle station but there's very little natural light in that room and not sure what type of lights to go with
AustralianMakeup,32vwmx,Jessijames,1 point,Fri Apr 17 13:31:51 2015 UTC,We'll I'm thinking of using one of those lit mirrors that have the magnification (my mum has one that she never uses that she's offered me). If that's not enough though I'm thinking of getting a smart bulb - my husband suggested this because you can modulate the kind of light it gives off. I haven't done he research yet but he thinks you can get them from Dick Smith. But if not you can certainly get them online. Failing that I will go with the softest most natural LED string lights I can find.
AustralianMakeup,32wwsn,deluxecreampuff,5,Fri Apr 17 11:53:39 2015 UTC,"I have MP soft touch blush in winter's end and autumn calling, and max factor creme puff blush in seductive pink. I can't really choose because I like them both for different purposes so here's a collection of thoughts.    creme puff is softer to touch and has better pigmentation  creme puff in seductive pink comes out with a satin sort of finish soft touch in autumn calling is shimmer with small visible sparkles, still wearable in the day  soft touch in winter's end has atrocious pigmentation if you want it for a blush, but it is a gorgeous sparkle-free daytime highlight with the slightest pink undertone soft touch in winter's end can be built up to a pale baby pink blush, if you like marshmallow pink cheeks soft touch in winter's end (my item at least) had a sort of hard dried film-y layer on it that I had to rub off with a finger to be able to pick up product, even though it was sealed soft touch is harder to pick up product  creme puff kicks up a little product soft touch has 12m expiry creme puff has 36m expiry  soft touch is 3.5g creme puff has no weight on it but boots.com says 1.5g   This is completely unorganised but I hope it helps in some way. I do only have one of the creme puff blushes but I love it and can't really fault it. It's my 'fancy' drugstore blush. I wear the soft touch blush in winter's end every single day though, and autumn calling is a lovely every day blush."
AustralianMakeup,32wwsn,criti_biti,2,Fri Apr 17 12:28:57 2015 UTC,Wow. This is all kinds of awesome. Thank you! Think I will opt for Creme Puff as a) I had the same issue with Bourjois blush and the hard dried film - so annoying. Also I would prefer no shimmer.
AustralianMakeup,32wwsn,LaTableElitaire,1 point,Fri Apr 17 21:03:50 2015 UTC,WAIT where did you get the expiration dates from?! I would love to know where I can find that kind of info on some other makeup products.
AustralianMakeup,32wwsn,compactgirlfriend,3,Fri Apr 17 14:35:28 2015 UTC,Usually there's like a little tub icon with a number followed by an M. That indicates the expiry in terms of months.
AustralianMakeup,32wwsn,LaTableElitaire,1 point,Fri Apr 17 15:12:22 2015 UTC,OMG I SEE IT! Thank you!!   Is it months after opening or months after buying?
AustralianMakeup,32wwsn,pondicus,3,Fri Apr 17 15:16:15 2015 UTC,"Usually after opening, but you can decide with a combination of the month indicator and common sense aka my face/eyes/lips are breaking out since using this product or if it smells funky, don't use it."

AustralianMakeup,32v5rs,Jessijames,4,Thu Apr 16 23:46:27 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the suggestion /u/Tonkie !!!  There are so many others I will be checking out over the next few weeks too, so thank you to everyone else for your suggestions. I can't wait to swatch all of the rose gold things!  This shadow water concoction has blown my expectations out of the water and its only day one...I can't wait to see how it holds up, I have applied it without a primer so I will check back at the end of the day! It's so easy to blend out with your finger all over the lid, and tomorrow I will be trying it on the lower lash-line with a neutral matte eye for a pop of colour I think. I am also extremely impatient with how slowly my brows are growing out, trying to un-do the damage from over-plucking in my teens is a LOT of work :/  EDIT: & holy jeepers my god-awful nose crease pores stand out like crazy in this shot hahaha  Product list;   MAC Omega first in the crease as a transition, with a little bit of Quarry right in there nice & deep-like to... deepen. (both from the Cinderella palette) Josie Maran Coconut Watercolour Shadow in Rio De Rose all over the lid and as a base Inglot #160 (a rosey-taupe) in the outer third, very lightly for dimension Inglot #450P (Dupe for MAC Cranberry) in the outer V very gently just to deepen Inglot shade I can't remember right now (don't shoot me) but it's a pale yellow-gold in the inner corner Maybelline Master Precise liquid liner for wing Essence Maximum Definition mascara - seriously the best mascara for lengthening without too much volume. The wand is perfect for separating my super unruly lashes, I find volumising mascaras make my lashes clump a lot if I'm not careful so this is a nice super easy go-to in a rush! ABH Dipbrow in Dark Brown to fill in my brows. I HATE my shape but I am trying to grow them out so I'm not touching them! I find if I overdraw to fill in that 'inner-under' line it stands out far too much for my liking and looks awful so I just gently fill them in for now and sharpen the bottom underline as much as possible."
AustralianMakeup,32v5rs,Tonkie,2,Thu Apr 16 23:57:22 2015 UTC,":D it's gorgeous, huh? It's a really pretty colour on you, great look :)   You inspired me too... I've done a 'no brush' look using this, LM caviar stick in sugar frost, and By Terry Bronze moon on the lash line. ( this was the hardest part cod I can't see close up from my left eye so hopefully my right eye does not look crazy...it's hidden behind glasses though so I should be good ;)  Do you like the 'cooling' feeling?   Also your brows are fiiiiine the shape is nice, don't worry :)"
AustralianMakeup,32v5rs,Tonkie,1 point,Fri Apr 17 00:28:34 2015 UTC,"There's a cooling feeling?! o.O To be fair I was rushed this morning so I will check again when I use it tomorrow hahaha  Yeah, I tried spreading it with a flat brush with no luck but as soon as I used my finger boom blended like a dream! That look sounds really lovely, too! :) I feel you on the glasses thing, my craptastic lashes don't bother all that much because they're disguised by glasses ha   Really? They look fine to me in person but as soon as I try and take pictures, they look like the front end is a sideways C-shape to me so I am trying to let that inside of the curve fill in and I also need to get my arches re-shaped and matched to each other but I want to go to a good brow place who actually knows what they're doing not some run of the mill salon who will just wax all my progress off!"
AustralianMakeup,32v5rs,lady_hazel,1 point,Fri Apr 17 00:40:57 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah fingers all the way! But I reckon you can do a precise line with the right, fine brush. Or, even wash the colour out of a felt tip liner and dip it in the colour and draw a line which is an idea I literally just thought of while typing this and will try!   I get what you mean about your brows, I have a very similar curve blank part, it's poxy as. But!  They're all good :)"
AustralianMakeup,32v5rs,lady_hazel,1 point,Fri Apr 17 11:18:36 2015 UTC,"What a great colour! I have never tried Josie Maran products before but this look is seriously making me want to check them out! Also, I love that Essence mascara, I use it daily.

AustralianMakeup,32v5rs,Tonkie,1 point,Fri Apr 17 01:49:14 2015 UTC,"I use quite a few essence products and I have always been impressed with the products. I recommend:       Their lipsticks especially shade #6 (a great brown/pink MLBB) ""Gel eye pencil waterproof"" - long lasting even in the waterline. I use the shade #6 ""cocoa bean"" for tightlining ""Long lasting eye pencil"" - I love #2 ""hot chocolate"", #18 berry merry and #19 hot scorch the clear brow gel ""Eyebrow designer"" in dark brown. Has a handy little brush and is easy to use. Just freeze before sharpening. their silky touch blush and the gradient blushes are really nice   Their limited edition stuff is usually pretty good, especially bronzers and highlighters :)"
AustralianMakeup,32v5rs,pondicus,1 point,Fri Apr 17 02:13:55 2015 UTC,Unf. I think I may wander past Mecca/Kit on the way home and swatch this. You and /u/Tonkie have me sold on it and I haven't even seen it in person yet...
AustralianMakeup,32w37g,peanut_23,5,Fri Apr 17 04:49:44 2015 UTC,"what colours do you have?  if it's Rio-D, just give up and quit while youre ahead lol....  the thinner the layer the better, but some of the other people will have better tips for you...."
AustralianMakeup,32w37g,gospursgo_,1 point,Fri Apr 17 05:22:04 2015 UTC,"I've got nycee and doobai, which is a reddy-orange and a deep reddy-purple, what was the issue with the Rio-D?"
AustralianMakeup,32w37g,Zanyigloo,1 point,Fri Apr 17 06:10:29 2015 UTC,I have is Rio-d. I hate it. It can not be put on without patches. I was so excited by this product then got this colour and it's terrible. I've been wanting try others but worried they will be the same. It gives me hope that other colours will be better.
AustralianMakeup,32w37g,xenomorphic_acid,2,Fri Apr 17 13:21:53 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on the shade, honestly. I have nycee, grandmaster pash, budapash and doobai. The last two are a bit patchier (because they are darker I think?) but the most important thing is to do a thin even layer. I get the best application using a lip brush for the edges, then fill in with the doe foot applicator. Also don't put your lips together until it's dry."
AustralianMakeup,32w37g,innocuous_username,2,Fri Apr 17 06:03:20 2015 UTC,"I second the lip brush suggestion ... I line then use lip brush, no doe foot application at all."
AustralianMakeup,32w37g,xenomorphic_acid,1 point,Fri Apr 17 08:06:57 2015 UTC,"I've got the nycee and doobai shades, I did find the nycee was nicer, which agrees with your patchiness comment, but I do love the colour, so I hope I can get it right :P I'll have a go with a lip brush and see what happens, thanks! I'll also have to use great self control about not putting my lips together..."
AustralianMakeup,32w37g,lush1984,3,Fri Apr 17 06:12:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah the colours are awesome, it's worth the effort! The first time I wore doobai I think I put way too much product on and it started balling up after only a couple of hours and was really gross. (Luckily I was at home to take it off!) Next time I went with two super thin layers, and although it wasn't perfect, it was much better.  Also when removing it, (especially if you are practising and removing them lots), use an oil based makeup remover. It's so much easier on your lips, I use mineral oil usually but you can use olive or coconut or whatever."
AustralianMakeup,32w37g,thexcheshirexcat,2,Fri Apr 17 06:54:31 2015 UTC,I have all the shades (crazy for matte lip creams here!) but I find that applying a Chapstick before and/or after helps with the shades that are patchy to go on even and after application makes it nicer feeling and less Bally.  Apply one coat over your lips. If you get interrupted then wipe off and start again. Layering = balling.   Most of the time I just Chapstick after unless I'm applying budapash.   Oh I love grand master pash. That's nice.
AustralianMakeup,32w37g,lush1984,1 point,Fri Apr 17 08:02:49 2015 UTC,"I feel so soothed knowing that you own all the shades, so you have faith in the product. Does the chapstick over the top help a bit with it feeling so dry? I tried applying it just before uni one day and realised it didn't come off so easily and ended up being late trying to get it all off before I left the house :P Bought an oil based makeup remover the day after. Thanks for all the help, I'm excited to give it another solid go!"
AustralianMakeup,32w37g,xenomorphic_acid,2,Fri Apr 17 08:29:06 2015 UTC,I use olive oil on a cotton bud to remove it! Works a treat
AustralianMakeup,32w37g,violetbang,2,Fri Apr 17 10:05:43 2015 UTC,"I do! Some are better shades than others but for the majority, they're a good formula.   The Chapstick or balm helps with the dry feeling. I also feel that it wears more evenly that way. Instead of it balling or fading from the Middle, it kind of sets it in place and you wear it out to a stain all over the lips. NY-Cee especially."
AustralianMakeup,32w37g,pumpkinspicevodka,1 point,Sun Apr 19 13:09:36 2015 UTC,"Oh and not putting your lips together only needs to be about 30 seconds, as you say, it dries really quickly."
AustralianMakeup,32w37g,crossesafimelb,1 point,Fri Apr 17 06:56:24 2015 UTC,"As already mentioned, using a lip balm and applying an even layer first are good tips. I also find working from the inside out to the edges of the lip helpful too. Don't give up! They're great products :)"

I tried MAC match master as a replacement...... Yuk and was not looking forward to the foundation merry go round, hence the 4 bottles! Hope for everyone's sake they stock the new formula soon."
AustralianMakeup,32vv78,maymila,21,Fri Apr 17 03:28:17 2015 UTC,Lucas papaw ointment. It's the greatest thing we produce. Use it on dry lips in the winter.  Fall over graze your knee. Sunburn. Chaffed ass. Razor burn. Smear a little on and your good to go. Keep it in your bag for all emergencies and it's has a bonus of being a fab emergency lip gloss. Edit: also great for dry skin.

AustralianMakeup,32vv78,lickable_wallpaper,1 point,Sun Apr 19 00:55:22 2015 UTC,No its not scented.  There are some other brands that come scented though just have a look in priceline or at coles and see when you can find. I'm a natural girl. I like the unscented kinds.b
AustralianMakeup,32vv78,breviloquent-,10,Fri Apr 17 23:54:22 2015 UTC,"Australis is probably what I would recommend the most. Their Velourlips are amazing and they do a contour kit which quite a few people like.   Bourjois Healthy Mix Serum or Healthy Mix seems to be hard to find in America so I would say get that, along with any Bourjois products you're interested in.  Also, I would pick up some of the Maybelline Colour Drama lipsticks because I believe you cant get them there and they are my HG drugstore lip product!  If you want cheap blush, Savvy (sold in Priceline - kinda like your Ulta) sells really nice blushes for around $5"

Face Of Australia do a blush that is a near dupe for NARS Orgasm, called O Peachy.

AustralianMakeup,32vv78,thexcheshirexcat,2,Fri Apr 17 14:42:36 2015 UTC,"Hahaha I think it's more that, I don't really like to buy souvenirs, but if I bought a couple of Australian makeup items, each time I used it, it will remind me of my time in Australia. I'm willing to pay a little more for that!"
AustralianMakeup,32vv78,Tuipie,0,Fri Apr 17 15:34:21 2015 UTC,"not always true, check out their price promise though i agree a lot of the ""drugstore"" brands like revlon and l'oreal are ridiculously overpriced as well as MAC (almost 2x) and benefit but i do stand by mecca's pricing policy, and considering the AUD conversion rates now, a lot of the products are actually cheaper to buy from mecca for us than from overseas e.g. AU$35 for bare minerals original vs US$28 (which atm is equiv to approx AU$37)"
AustralianMakeup,32vv78,deadlypony,1 point,Fri Apr 17 15:20:59 2015 UTC,"Even though Mecca charges on average 15% more than US prices (their reason: 10% GST and 5% for ""shipping handling, and customs duties"") this only applies to their exclusive brands (as stated in their Pricing Promise); goodness knows how the prices are calculated for non-exclusive brands. Despite the extra 15% charge that we pay for anyways (burden on consumers rather than Mecca), we don't get nearly as many sales (or any at all?) in comparison to how often brands/stores have sales in America.   I agree some items are cheaper at their RRP to buy in Australia compared to America due to the exchange rate right now but a lot of things are not even with the crappy exchange rate e.g. YSL Rouge Volupté Lipsticks are $55 ($36 USD); Hourglass Ambient Lighting Palette $76 ($58 USD); Stila In The Light Palette $52 ($20 USD on sale - been on sale for at least the last month so probs won't change for awhile).   All in all, if you were to do two exactly the same hauls - one in America and one in Australia - the haul in America will still end up being cheaper. If you were to buy just one item maybe that item will be cheaper to buy full price in Australia than in America.   Source: I buy too much stuff."
AustralianMakeup,32vv78,thexcheshirexcat,0,Fri Apr 17 16:04:00 2015 UTC,"That is the sad point about cosmetics in Australia :( because it's so difficult to obtain here, companies become reluctant to have these kinds of sales - to keep them ""luxury"" and ""exclusive"". Though what I wanted to covey through my comment was not that stuff in Australia is inexpensive to buy, but that some of it is reasonably priced. I don't think its a fair judgment to say that everything here is expensive, since we do have higher base income and we also have taxes INCLUDED in our prices. But still, I do wish Mecca would have at least some beauty loop vip sales from time to time. Lol sephora. Forget sales, bring out your damn memberships already."
AustralianMakeup,32vv78,LaTableElitaire,1 point,Thu Apr 23 17:53:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, we do have a higher base income (unemployment is high though) but our cost of living is also really high. In exchange for the high cost of living in Australia we have a high standard of living (public schools, free Medicare, beaches, and what not). What's unreasonable about the high cost of cosmetics in Australia is why we pay more for the. exact. same. product. Even though we can ""afford"" to pay more for the same cosmetics it doesn't mean that we should.     Omg Sephora. I have no idea why they haven't yet rolled out not just a membership program but their online shopping website - I would drop so much money."

My eyebrows are naturally very full so using them would've given me brows that are 90s style in proportion.

AustralianMakeup,32sopq,Jessijames,1 point,Fri Apr 17 00:47:14 2015 UTC,"That gauge the market excuse is a bit bullshit if you ask me, the Sydney opening (and the impossibility of even having a chance to properly shop in the store for weeks afterwards) is a testament to the enormous demand for a Sephora and some of the brands it bought out here.   There's no way that a business like Sephora wouldn't have been well aware of that demand and the time it has even taken to get to open a Melbourne store with no word of when we'll get an online store has damaged the brand here if anything. I agree that they should've opened at the very least a store in Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney within the first month or two at least with an online store available definitely from the first month. The whole thing feels very poorly planned out to me and I feel really put off Sephora at this point."

AustralianMakeup,32s39d,shootforhoops,10,Thu Apr 16 06:57:31 2015 UTC,Wouldn't be surprised if Lust Have It and Bella Box both end up going bust - both have awful customer service and are run by people that have no sense of organisation and planning.     Personally if I was still subscribed I would be speaking to the ACCC as LHI has failed to deliver the product and has not made an effort to update customers. Doubt it would get anywhere but still.

The Korean brand Holika Holika has a jewel light waterproof eyeliner in Pink Topaz that is slightly less pink as well and it has great staying power but I find the glitter in it quite chunky.

I think she's on holiday now, but she has a new collection coming out next month.  Femme Fatale also stocks them (and their own house brand!), and they're based in Qld, so a little more local. Mendelssohn, Fey, Corgi Butts and 23 are pretty huge favourites.   Shiro's I Tried is a very pink rose-gold too, along with Full of Craft. Also stocked by Femme Fatale.  Fyrinnae is another brand and their Rapunzel Had Extensions is a rose-peach and is their best selling shade.  Otherwise, Asian beauty brands like Tony Moly, Holika Holika and Etude House have eyeliners in a bunch of shades - you might find a rose gold there. EBay seller, rubyruby76 is a reputable seller if you're interested.  Have you tried Stila or Urban Decay? They might have a rose gold shade.   I normally turn my shadows into liners by mixing them with a bit of eye primer and applying with an angled brush.  Good luck! :)"

AustralianMakeup,32o58k,Crumpet92,3,Wed Apr 15 14:16:22 2015 UTC,"I started using BYS back in the beginning of learning how to do makeup, so I've always had a bit of a soft spot for them.  I really enjoy their blushes (I have a single one, and a blush trio) and they're nicely pigmented. Their eyeshadows are also fairly decent (A few are a major miss, but with a primer + white base, they become considerably better).  Their mascaras are fairly decent, and I used to LOVE their pencil eyeliners.  I also love their nail polishes, but they do separate quite easily, so just beware of that (But, you just need to give them a shake and they go back to normal)"

Very well pigmented and a nice smooth texture despite the shimmer. I have had eyeshadows before but never really ended up using them. The extremely cheap knock off nude palette does look quite nice though ;)"

AustralianMakeup,32mh13,Amielia,3,Tue Apr 14 23:41:43 2015 UTC,I had a brush emergency once and wondered the same thing. I felt the brush I was looking at though (IIRC it was the purple eyeshadow brush) and through the packet I could feel the bristles seemed quite hard and inflexible. This was through the packet though so I could be wrong!  I ended up just going with finger application because I didn't want to end up with a crappy brush (#cheap) but I'd love to know if anyone has used these!
AustralianMakeup,32mh13,smilingsunbeams,3,Wed Apr 15 01:18:17 2015 UTC,"I bought the concealer brush from Kmart and it was a waste of money :( the bristles were so hard and poked the absolute hell out of my undereyes.  I actually had itchy,  red irritated scaly skin the next day under my eyes where I had used the brush.     I can't say much for the other brushes,  but I feel the quality leaves much to be desired,  get some RT brushes off iherb instead!"
AustralianMakeup,32mh13,_yoshiii,1 point,Wed Apr 15 06:33:16 2015 UTC,"Oh my gosh that's awful, so glad I didn't end up buying any! Oh man the RT brushes are so pretty, they're going on the wish list!"

AustralianMakeup,32mh13,courpsey,2,Wed Apr 15 08:58:48 2015 UTC,If you're after cheap brushes I would definitely recommend AliExpress. I found the best angle brush to tightline and do my brows and it cost 68 cents. I bought 4.

AustralianMakeup,32mh13,violetbang,2,Wed Apr 15 11:40:30 2015 UTC,"I bought the angled liner brush maybe a year ago. I've used it perhaps a handful of times, it works ok with liquid liner but there's no way it could handle a gel (too bendy). Haven't bothered with anything since, particularly now that the elf brushes are only a shelf or two away"

AustralianMakeup,32jhh6,lady_hazel,1 point,Thu Apr 16 15:05:05 2015 UTC,Thanks - I'll try to get to Target tomorrow. My local Priceline is going to call me when the lipsticks come in but I didn't ask them about the other items. Silly me!
AustralianMakeup,32jhh6,lady_hazel,1 point,Fri Apr 17 01:48:30 2015 UTC,"I only found them because I saw a mauve tube in some random place on a nyx display and I thought it was a new rimmel lipstick, I looked on the bottom and it said Essence, so I hightailed it to the display. You know how their displays have a centre section that displays a bunch of products fitting a theme? These were not in that section, but in the regular lipstick and gloss holders underneath. I'm hoping they'll be permanent."
AustralianMakeup,32jhh6,mild_party_time,2,Fri Apr 17 04:34:56 2015 UTC,Sounds promising if they were integrated within the display and not with the LE stuff! I saw a few items at Target but it seemed that they hadn't finished re-stocking it.

I have all their colours, Just love them.  I also have Soap and Glory Sexy Mother Plucker xl. This ones is more plumping compared to Too faced. But may be 'too tingly' for some people.

AustralianMakeup,32j0iy,Jessijames,2,Tue Apr 14 04:23:24 2015 UTC,"It's completely different to studio fix/fresh and flawless as they are much heavier coverage and matte. I quite like it but don't use it often as it has little sparkles, and yes they are detectable. It has a sheer finish, a good range of colours and lasts quite a long time (I mean the amount you get). I wouldn't buy it again because I prefer to add highlighter and it's expensive for a touch up powder, but I think it is a good product and I have friends who adore it. Would totally rebuy if not for the sparkle."

When I placed my order directly and put in the freight forwarding address, Sephora cancelled my order so I had to get HopShopGo to order for me (for a charge). I placed an order for about ~16 items but I was only allowed to place for a max of 8 or Sephora cancels it. So then I had to make 2 orders -_-    After all that, I finally got my orders on the way to me. It cost $53.90AUD for a chargeable weight of 3kgs and 2 packages. It arrived within a week.

AustralianMakeup,32i3uw,AgentLauren,2,Tue Apr 14 02:20:12 2015 UTC,"I've used PriceUSA. No sign up for an account needed so you can do one off orders, and no monthly fees or anything. Shipping was about what I'd expect ordering from anywhere overseas and not outrageously over, I think I paid $20 shipping or something? You put in a request for a quote and they give you an estimate, and then order for you, and they kept me updated the entire time, especially when an item was a difference price from what I put in for the estimate. Could cancel at anytime, overall I was very impressed!"

AustralianMakeup,32i3uw,sarkata,1 point,Tue Apr 14 00:00:48 2015 UTC,"I've used MyUs but my other recommendation is if your package isn't too large and you fit the requirements, look at getting someone to actually forward things to you. I've had success using the Makeup Exchange here on reddit for smaller packages (handfuls of lipstick at a time) and people are generally very sweet and will just charge you the price of the shipping for them, which tends to be lower than a forwarding service because they have to make profit."

AustralianMakeup,32i3uw,Soan,1 point,Tue Apr 14 05:02:35 2015 UTC,I usually try and return the favour where possible or transfer them a little extra money but a lot of the time people really do just enjoy sharing access to makeup with those of us who don't have access to it.

AustralianMakeup,32faal,Jessijames,2,Mon Apr 13 09:30:31 2015 UTC,"Never thought I'd be praised for my photo taking skills haha! I just used a basic Sony digital camera - nothing special. There was a lot of messing with the settings involved and I also took about fifty pictures before I could actually get some decent shots.   As for settings, I delayed the flash/shutter so it didn't wash everything out and set the distance to ""close up""."
AustralianMakeup,32faal,Jessijames,2,Mon Apr 13 10:27:48 2015 UTC,Thanks for that - I will have to have a look at my camera when I get home! Was there a section in your settings actually called 'shutter' or something or did you just have to play around with different things to get it to delay?
AustralianMakeup,32faal,Jessijames,1 point,Tue Apr 14 03:15:39 2015 UTC,"In the flash setting there's one called 'Slow Sync'.

AustralianMakeup,32fve2,elfies_,1 point,Mon Apr 13 14:48:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can definitely return it to a different Mecca store.

AustralianMakeup,32fve2,icicle_,1 point,Wed Apr 15 06:53:49 2015 UTC,"I'm under the impression that the formulation of these is very similar to that of the Australis Velourlips (very dry, balls up if too heavy on lips), so I'd suggest to apply the thinnest, most even layer you possibly can! Use a lip brush for the outline and then fill in using the original doe foot applicator :)  Also it could help to exfoliate and put some lipbalm on your lips beforehand."

AustralianMakeup,32dtf4,deadpanorama,3,Mon Apr 13 00:12:28 2015 UTC,"I've only used mine once but it has promise.  To be honest, I'm not loving the feel of this compared to my ChiChi sponge, but I think that's more an issue of having to 'break it in' so to speak as well as getting used to the shape (I usually use an hourglass shape).  I'll be sure to post an update in this thread after a couple of days of use. Right now I'd say its great as a backup, or for somebody on a limited budget wanting to play around with a sponge for the first time."
AustralianMakeup,32dtf4,Tomkhagai,1 point,Mon Apr 13 01:26:43 2015 UTC,"Have you guys used the ecotools one that comes on a long handle? I've chucked my bigger sponges now. I use the ecotools one around the eyes, then use fingers for the rest of the face.  Um, I might be a bit of a grot."
AustralianMakeup,32dtf4,gospursgo_,2,Tue Apr 14 11:43:02 2015 UTC,"ooooh, $2!!! can you compare how soft is it to chichi or real techniques sponges?"
AustralianMakeup,32dtf4,gospursgo_,4,Mon Apr 13 00:37:15 2015 UTC,"I have the orange hourglass sponge from ChiChi, haven't tried the real techniques sponges personally.   The Coles sponge seems firmer than the ChiChi sponge and doesn't seem as good at blending, however I think that's more due to the fact that I have only used the Coles sponge once. I expect it will lose some of its firmness after a few more uses which will in turn make blending easier.   There is also a size difference which I'm still getting used to. I'm thinking of going back to Coles to pick up their hourglass sponge just to see if its the size or the shape which makes it feel awkward to me.   I guess for me its still early days. After a few more uses I'll have a better idea of whether I like this or not. In any case, its only $2 so if it doesn't work  out I won't be too fussed. At this point I can say that it's much better than when I used to use my fingers and blends better than when I use a brush.   For anyone on a limited budget I think its a pretty good way of trying a sponge for the first time, or as a backup for those days when you go to use 'old faithful' and find it waaay to skanky to put anywhere near your face :p"

AustralianMakeup,32fegb,killingxspree,4,Mon Apr 13 11:07:13 2015 UTC,"i have different suggestions for different skin types; if you've got dry-normal skin i'd definitely recommend you check out revlon nearly naked, it's VERY lightweight feeling and can build up to a medium coverage, only downside is you do need to set it or it will break up because it's quite a hydrating formula too - not good for oily skin but will put up with combination. Really comprehensive shade range too which is awesome. rimmel wake me up is a life saver for dry skin, super hydrating and gives you that healthy awake looking glow, definitely light-medium coverage, lasting power is pretty good too especially if set with powder. Only bad thing is the shade range is pretty crap and runs a bit pink.  if you've got combination to oily skin then i'd recommend the bourjois healthy mix foundation/serum; has a gorgeous finish and coverage, lasting power is incredible; actually works pretty well for dry skin i just recommend it for combination as well because it fares a lot better than other drugstore foundation; personally i think the shade range is crap (it's got like 5 shades) but same goes for most drugstore brands.    sorry for text block! hope that helps"
AustralianMakeup,32fegb,deluxecreampuff,2,Mon Apr 13 15:27:46 2015 UTC,"I bought alot of foundations during the priceline sale so I thought I might post and hope it helps you avoid buying too many. I have dry pale skin in my tzone. foundations basically last forever on me. loreal eau de teint nude: light to medium coverage. bottle smells like alcohol. takes awhile to stop slipping (ie if you keep spreading it out on you r face it will be rubbed out) when you apply to get more full coverage you need to apply a lot like basically paint it out then slowly blend (not good for those with bad skin) didnt take to the beauty blender or brushes. also not perfect for dry skin i.e can accentuate flaking leaves satin matte finish. despite all this its probably my favourite. Beautiful finish reminds me a little of luminous silk but less satin finish and less thick then luminous. stays on all day but coverage is light. little bit of shine comes through but looks the most natural out of all my foundations.shade doesnt look as dark on skin as bottle. bourjois healthy mix vs serum. serum better for my dry skin. shade 32 pretty yellow dark despite hype. good for dry skin. looove the smell. pump on serum gives too product. sometimes abit shiny. bourjois 123 cc smells like old lady weirdly lots of coverage. ok on dry skin. shade 31 not vampire ginger white. but like when I want super coverage. loreal lumi doesnt like my dry areas. good coverage (not full, medium), shade n1 way better then w1. w1 was too dark. lasts good. beautiful on good skin days. maybelline bb dream sucks. do not touch. feels soooo yucky on my skin. weirdly pinkish cast. hate with the passion of 1000 fiery hells. revlon nearly nude ok on dry skin. great shade match. buildable, coverage medium. overall ok you might love but feel like others are better. match perfection weird pink cast to skin. okay dry skin. light to medium. need to test more but didn't seem to last long on me despite. australis mineral foundation silicony doesnt last. very buildable ok for cheapie. shade pretty light. sorry about formatting using mobile"
AustralianMakeup,32fegb,badassbettie,1 point,Wed Apr 15 13:13:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks :) I ended up buying the same revlon colorstay, but for dry skin instead of oily/combo. The lady actually matched me amazingly. No foundation lines for me when I wore it to work today!"
AustralianMakeup,32fegb,badassbettie,1 point,Wed Apr 15 13:39:18 2015 UTC,Priceline has just got the Covergirl Ready Set Gorgeous foundation. Very lightweight and lasts all day. I'm really enjoying it.
AustralianMakeup,32f0hl,smilingsunbeams,3,Mon Apr 13 06:45:59 2015 UTC,"I like this foundation but I can't apply it my normal way. if I use a brush, I quite literally look like I've been for a 10k run in the summer heat (sweat city). however, with the RT sponge or a bit of powder it's a pretty nice medium coverage base."
AustralianMakeup,32f0hl,neodeone,1 point,Mon Apr 13 08:03:50 2015 UTC,This sounds promising because I'm too noob to apply foundation with a brush (I don't know why it never works out for me) and I love my RT sponge! Thanks :)
AustralianMakeup,32f0hl,Esoterria,1 point,Mon Apr 13 08:08:50 2015 UTC,"No negative reviews here! I have it in ""Ivory"" and it's a perfect colour match, stays all day, applies easily, etc.   Tbh it's pretty cheap for a great foundation so you may as well just give it a try."
AustralianMakeup,32f0hl,obliviscere,1 point,Mon Apr 13 07:06:30 2015 UTC,Yeah atm it's like $10 a bottle but since I'm on a no buy I'm almost looking for excuses not to try it haha  Thank you for the review!
AustralianMakeup,32f0hl,Amielia,1 point,Mon Apr 13 08:06:54 2015 UTC,"I loved the formula (normal-dry skin), but unfortunately, it oxidised really badly on my skin! But for the price, I definitely see why it's so positively rated and it's definitely still worth a go."
AustralianMakeup,32f0hl,sarkata,2,Mon Apr 13 08:04:23 2015 UTC,"This is what I was hoping to hear. Is it just me that kind of worries when you can't find any negatives in product reviews? Anyway I'll definitely swatch first and buy later if I'm picking it up, thank you for that!"

AustralianMakeup,32f0hl,Artemisian11,1 point,Wed Apr 15 11:46:14 2015 UTC,"I actually love it and I know that's not helpful! The original lasting finish is a bit too heavy for me for every day, but I like that the lasting finish nude is light on the skin but still gives me a fair bit of coverage. I am lucky that I fit into their shade range, which I know is quite limited (get your shit together rimmel). It isn't high enough coverage for the worst of my bad skin days, but it's a lovely easy foundation that doesn't require much fuss - just fingers - and I don't have to put too much thought into it."
AustralianMakeup,32f0hl,Artemisian11,1 point,Mon Apr 13 10:49:41 2015 UTC,Thank you! I think based on what I've heard I'm gonna pull the trigger (it's only $10 right now anyway). Do you find it's very long lasting? I kind of am really lazy and just want a put it on and forget about it kinda thing.
AustralianMakeup,32f0hl,Amielia,1 point,Mon Apr 13 10:56:05 2015 UTC,"The price is deifnitely a big pro for me!   I don't get exceptionally long wear (the original lasting finish lasts forever on me for some reason, but as this is lighter it's definitely shorter wearing) but I don't find myself rushing for touch ups - I find that I can go through an eight hour work day only powdering occasionally. My skin is pretty weird combination and unpredictable so I never know how foundation will react to it and whether it will amp up the oiliness or the dryness or the textural inconsistencies or the pimples, so it's sort of pot luck and this one just clicked for me.  I am the laziest with foundation though and this is probably my favourite for that. I don't bother with tools, just throw it on and generally my skin still looks at least okay at the end of the day."
AustralianMakeup,32f0hl,Artemisian11,1 point,Mon Apr 13 11:08:12 2015 UTC,Sounds like exactly what I'm after! I barely wear a full face anyway so I can't justify some crazy expensive bottle but of course I still want it to act like a high end product ;)

AustralianMakeup,32efbf,backwards01,2,Tue Apr 14 08:45:15 2015 UTC,Albatross- NARS  Edit: I actually have a highlighter by Savvy I picked up for $3 at Priceline in a bargain bin. It is beautiful and light. I think it's still available at Priceline. It comes with a contour powder too.
AustralianMakeup,32efbf,duneacha,1 point,Mon Apr 13 05:11:31 2015 UTC,"Oh, is it this one?  This is my HG highlighter. It's so blendable, and the shimmer flakes are microscopic. I stockpiled. :p"

AustralianMakeup,32efbf,Crumpet92,0,Mon Apr 13 23:03:39 2015 UTC,Priceline? I thought Mecca was only the place that sold NARS - Albatross. Mine didn't come in a contour duo though.
AustralianMakeup,32efbf,backwards01,0,Wed Apr 15 14:11:54 2015 UTC,I was referring to the other highlighter! ;)
AustralianMakeup,32efbf,Joolebear,2,Wed Apr 15 20:39:27 2015 UTC,"If you want a really subtle one and don't mind splurging, go with the Hourglass ambient lighting powder. Also, if you can get your hands on it, Topshop makes a chubby stick beige highlighter that's quite subtle. Their cream highlighter in a pot is a duochrome pinky/silver and can be sheered out.   Gerard cosmetics bb illumination creme has been my go-to highlighter in the summer as it wears very well underneath/on top of my light coverage foundation. It's a warm golden shimmery liquid highlighter. Josie Maran's argan oil illuminator looks very similar but I'll bet the Josie Maran one will go bad first since it's mostly natural ingredients."
AustralianMakeup,32efbf,elfies_,2,Mon Apr 13 10:40:45 2015 UTC,hourglass ambient lighting powder in diffused light; it is very subtle but buildable and soooo beautiful - you can use it as an all over powder for a natural glow or concentrate it in certain areas for a stronger highlight. You can never overdo this and it never goes glittery.
AustralianMakeup,32efbf,Jessijames,2,Mon Apr 13 15:40:17 2015 UTC,For subtle at the moment I am really loving Benefit's Highbeam - I only have a deluxe sample size and I find it not too glittery or anything like that. I blend it in with a beauty blender and it gives a beautiful light sheen!   All the other highlighters I have are probably too pigmented for what you're after..I am a highlight fiend and the stronger the better for me haha
AustralianMakeup,32efbf,Jessijames,1 point,Mon Apr 13 02:55:15 2015 UTC,I'm kind of scared of cream/ liquid highlighters. I bought one and every time I used it I felt like it just smudged away my foundation underneath. Do you have this problem with high beam or does it blend well?
AustralianMakeup,32efbf,elfies_,2,Mon Apr 13 03:25:23 2015 UTC,"I find it blends quite well especially with the besuty blender, but before that i would just put a little on the back of my hand, tap my fingers in it and across my hand to tap off the excess and then only tap it onto my face and I find it never really moved what was underneath if I was gentle!"
AustralianMakeup,32efbf,deluxecreampuff,1 point,Mon Apr 13 03:56:41 2015 UTC,I'm just getting into highlighters and I want the strongest possible haha! What would you sav your favs are?
AustralianMakeup,32efbf,elfies_,3,Mon Apr 13 07:46:27 2015 UTC,For the strongest I would say the balms Mary loumanizer
AustralianMakeup,32efbf,Joolebear,1 point,Mon Apr 13 11:34:55 2015 UTC,"totaly agree with Mary-loumanizer, it's like bright lights kinda glow. Actually really love the golden undertones that give you warmth but aren't too yellow (i'm thinking of you nars albatross :/ )"
AustralianMakeup,32efbf,Joolebear,1 point,Mon Apr 13 15:42:57 2015 UTC,I bought Albatross recently and HATE it. Thinking of returning it.
AustralianMakeup,32efbf,Jessijames,2,Tue Apr 14 01:01:26 2015 UTC,"I found it suuper glittery and just didn't want to sit nicely on top of anything :/ if you like the gold undertones though DEFINITELY switch it up for the Balm mary-loumanizer, it's gorgeous buttery and blends like a dream; best of all it has none of the disco ball glitter stuff that albatross does"
AustralianMakeup,32efbf,pootlepower,2,Tue Apr 14 07:04:34 2015 UTC,"Becca pressed shimmering skin perfector in Moonstone or Opal for you, maybe? :) They can be very intense. Seconding The Balm's Mary Loumanizer. Mac's MSF in Soft and Gentle is more intense than Lightscapade."
AustralianMakeup,32efbf,deadlypony,1 point,Mon Apr 13 10:46:03 2015 UTC,So is lightscepade more subtle than soft and gentle. I've heard amazing things about soft and gentle but nothing about lightscepade
AustralianMakeup,32efbf,deadlypony,1 point,Tue Apr 14 07:16:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, I found Lightscepade to be more subtle than Soft and Gentle because Lightscepade's a slightly lighter beige colour and the shimmer is sparser than Soft and Gentle. I would say Lightscepade would be easier to apply on fairer skin tones. Soft and Gentle wouldn't require as much layering on medium/deeper skin tones because it's quite pigmented."
AustralianMakeup,32efbf,walkyouhome,1 point,Tue Apr 14 10:17:36 2015 UTC,"Right now I'm loving MAC Mineralize Skinfinish in lightscapade & The Balm's Mary Loumanizer - don't get me wrong, you can definitely be light handed with these but I find these two to build up really well and it's hard to make it look like 'too much' even if you like it heavy! :)"
AustralianMakeup,32efbf,Tonkie,2,Mon Apr 13 08:01:52 2015 UTC,The Soft Touch powders by Models Prefer. They're subtle enough that I sometimes wear them over my face when my foundation turns out too matte.
AustralianMakeup,32efbf,likeabandit,1 point,Mon Apr 13 07:26:19 2015 UTC,Yea I have two of models prefer soft touch powders. I have been trying luminous glow one as a highlight lately and I think it's a tad too subtle. I do love the two I have though

AustralianMakeup,32efbf,MsMacquarie,1 point,Mon Apr 13 21:10:47 2015 UTC,"I use Smashbox soft lights in Prism every day. It's shimmery enough that it makes a visible difference when your face catches the light, but it's a very fine powder and not actually glittery so it's not overpowering."

AustralianMakeup,32ai1p,Leisabet,1 point,Sun Apr 12 02:43:02 2015 UTC,"In Summary:  I have been taking these pictures daily as I get ready, which is why the light varies.  I havent used a curler or a comb. Theres no flash and no post production.  I promise I  filled in my brows and cleaned up the smudges before  I left the house :p   I did the UD perversion on Saturday because it doesn't work for me, and smudges on my eyelids which I don't care for. The cool thing about the photos is it highlights where I can improve my application. I just started trying out the  Josie Maran Coconut Water Eyecolour so thats been a learning curve... I am short sighted in my left eye and long sided in my right eye so I dont usually wear eyeshadow, but thought this might work because I can get a good wash of colour without intricate application.   My current favourite is the KVD Immortal Lash.  Bad Gal is probably at the end of its run and ready to be thrown out, but I am pleased to have captured it here, and I am planning to do the same for future mascaras.   Thanks for looking :)   Edit: this is the eyeshadow, I do a swipe along the lashes then pat it out with my finger, the lady at Kit was wearing it and it looked so good I got her to apply it on me and bought straight away!"
AustralianMakeup,32ai1p,Leisabet,1 point,Sun Apr 12 01:57:27 2015 UTC,"This is a pain, but keep a little paper fan with you when you're doing your mascara. It'll help it dry off faster and then you won't smudge. I had the same problem with the UD, but it makes my eyelashes look incredible, so manual drying-off it is.  Awesome post, thank you. I also really love that eyeshadow. :)"
AustralianMakeup,32ai1p,WarlockPanda,1 point,Sun Apr 12 03:03:59 2015 UTC,"Ok, thanks...you mean keep a piece of paper and fan my eyelashes dry?  I never even thought of it not being dry causing the problem! I thought it was an oily lid problem! You may have changed my life :p"
AustralianMakeup,32ai1p,WarlockPanda,2,Sun Apr 12 03:08:08 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's what I mean! :D UD Perversion seems to take much longer to dry than my other mascaras, and if I'm not careful with it my eyeshadow is ruined by an ill-timed blink. Give it a try anyway, because it does look lovely on you. :)"

AustralianMakeup,32bhnu,walkyouhome,5,Sun Apr 12 21:16:33 2015 UTC,"I was going to recommend some of The Balm's products but their online selection seems really crappy (I remember it being much better), I hope it doesn't mean they're no longer stocking them :(  Either way, if you're able to get in store, I'd recommend the How Bout them Apples cheek and lip tint palette or perhaps their NudeTude palette.  Other than that, I really love the L'Occitane hand creams and DJ's has some nice gift sets by them.   Unfortunately yeah, David Jones stocks some pretty hefty brands so you might not see too much out of a $50 gift card.  They do stock Natio as well which is on the cheaper end of the spectrum and MOR products aren't too expensive."

AustralianMakeup,329ftz,makeup_lady,4,Sat Apr 11 19:59:41 2015 UTC,"I've got Bronzonce and Jay Zed from that collection and I have oily hooded lids. Without a primer, they crease pretty badly after 2 hours but with a primer (I use The Balm's eye primer), they last 6 hours without creasing. It takes about half a minute to set on the eye and is easy to blend out with a brush. You only need a teeny bit for one layer to have great pigmentation (about the same as Maybelline color tattoos) but you can build it up if you want. I've had mine for 6 months now and they're not even close to drying out."
AustralianMakeup,329ftz,Joolebear,1 point,Sat Apr 11 22:08:18 2015 UTC,"Slightly irrelevant, but I have oily semi-hooded eyes, and was wondering if you think the Balm's eye primer is worth it? I'm currently using the Urban Decay Primer Potion which everyone says is the bees knees holy grail eye primer, but I hate it and still get creasing, so looking for something better.  Wondering if you would recommend it?"
AustralianMakeup,329ftz,jamballdonut,1 point,Sun Apr 12 01:37:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah I do think it's worth it! I've tried the UDPP, Lorac's eyeshadow primer and Too Faced's shadow insurance but they all don't perform to my expectations. I was gonna try the Nars one next but I picked up The Balm's eyeshadow primer first. It's skin-coloured and has a similar texture to Benefit's porefessional (slightly silicone-y) but goes on transparent and takes a minute to set. It typically keeps my powder eyeshadow and the Australis cream shadows on for 6 hours without creasing and the eyeshadow colours would still be there and almost as vibrant as when I first applied them after the 6 hours. My ultimate combo is The Balm's eyeshadow primer and Maybelline color tattoos: 12 hours of wear with minor creasing after 8 hours :)"

AustralianMakeup,329ftz,Joolebear,1 point,Sun Apr 12 10:49:45 2015 UTC,It was my first review on my blog! I love these and they're actually not too bad for how creamy they are. Usually I wear them over a base shadow + primer and I find I don't get too much creasing until around the 6-7 hour mark and even then it's not terrible creasing. I have extremely oily eyelids though!
AustralianMakeup,329ftz,smilingsunbeams,1 point,Sun Apr 12 01:20:43 2015 UTC,"I have 2 from the AC/ME collection, they're a little too 'glittery' for my taste when you really build them up but they are really nice. As the others have said, they blend out really well and I don't get much creasing on myself although creasing is not really an issue for me as I wear glasses daily so it's a not-noticeable thing. I usually wear them over bare lids and they do just fine! I will probably buy all of the shades in the new range that I don't already have so...yes, they're a great product for the price IMO!"

AustralianMakeup,32838g,startwithaguess,3,Tue Apr 14 12:26:34 2015 UTC,"I'm from Brisbane and went to Sephora in sydney a couple of months ago. I thought it would be awful for my bank account, but after some careful research, I only ended up buying the ABH brow wiz (which definitely lives up to the hype!!), and two sephora brand eyeliners in the waterproof 12hr wear line. These are really soft and last all day, priced really reasonably. The whole line is quite good, I would look at the reviews for the sephora line before you go!  If you search 'sephora prices' on this sub you should find the thread that was first created when it opened which lists the items it sells and the prices - can't link, on my phone sorry! I used that as a starting point to find items that sounded interesting and looked through makeup alley reviews.  I found the research really helped, because when I got there, it was hugeeee and quite pricey. I felt like if I had of gone without doing a bit of research first, I would have been overwhelmed and bought nothing, or I world have bought everything and been disappointed when products didn't work out.   Good luck, and have fun! :)"

The ground level is  fragrance and  make up,  and the upper level,  which I had to go to to check out, skin care and hair care.   It was very busy  and a little bit overwhelming.  I would spend your time on things you cant easily source elsewhere:   in  the ""mid range""  they had a good Bite stand, (my purchase was the  Agave Lip Treatment which was $33)  with all the pencils and lipsticks.   The Sephora brand range was very extensive.   Tarte,  Make Up For ever (MUFE) and  Marc Jacobs, and at luxury, Givenchy.  They also had Dior, YSl, Lancome but I didnt spend much time on those because I can access the counters at Myer or DJ.   Upstairs in the checkout,  they had a lot of  mini impulse buys,  some roller ball perfumes, mascara,  most of these were  $15  plus per item.    Hope that helps a bit :)"

AustralianMakeup,328k3j,MrsBurp,3,Sat Apr 11 15:26:24 2015 UTC,Try the occ lip liners :) there's some similar colours and they do a pretty awesome clear too. Available at lipstick Republic.   Ps wicked lippies are awesome! Love love love <3
AustralianMakeup,328k3j,LMTartistry,2,Mon Apr 13 06:35:30 2015 UTC,A clear lip liner (e.g. Models Prefer Infinite Lip Liner in Clearly Sealed) would work well if you're just looking to prevent feathering! Otherwise you can always fill in your lips with a liner that's the same colour as your lips. I don't have the NYX Wicked Lippies in particular but I've done this with black lipstick and had no problems!
AustralianMakeup,328k3j,chocolatespeckle,1 point,Sat Apr 11 15:36:22 2015 UTC,"I've tried the models prefer lipliner and I don't like it much D: using a lipliner that's a similar colour to my lips is a good idea though! Hadn't even considered that, thanks :)"
AustralianMakeup,328k3j,Jessijames,2,Sat Apr 11 15:42:22 2015 UTC,"I recently invested in the Urban Decay 24/7 lip pencil in 'Ozone' which is clear, I believe Too Faced do a similar pencil as well. So far it works great for me for preventing feathering and goes with everything because it's clear!"
AustralianMakeup,328k3j,Sleiphy,1 point,Sun Apr 12 02:49:30 2015 UTC,"I didn't even know you could get clear lipliner, haha. Thanks for the tip!"
AustralianMakeup,328k3j,fuzzboo,2,Sun Apr 12 03:21:14 2015 UTC,I have the UD ozone pencil and it is great but if you're after something a little cheaper Models Prefer also have a clear one available at priceline. The UD one is excellent imo.
AustralianMakeup,328k3j,sarkata,2,Sun Apr 12 11:06:09 2015 UTC,"honestly, i just use glittery eyeliner. make sure to check for ultramarines in the ingredients, which are considered eye-safe but not lip-safe."

AustralianMakeup,328k3j,lemonlemonboom,1 point,Sat Apr 11 23:17:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, up until this point I would do wild colours on my eyes but stick to fairly normal colours on my lips and now that I've tried the Wicked Lippies I am like why was I so afraid before??

AustralianMakeup,327d0g,sezzahd,4,Sat Apr 11 05:27:00 2015 UTC,"Hi, I really love your look, it gives you an amazing glow. My only criticism is maybe use a cooler toned bronzer such as nyx taupe for contouring rather than bronzing normally since you're so fair. Also not criticism but I think you'd look really lovely with a berry lip colour, it would contrast well with your features  xx"
AustralianMakeup,327d0g,brownbabe,1 point,Sat Apr 11 06:34:14 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much, I really appreciate it. I'll definitely try and find a berry shade, although I've never been game enough to wear any lip products."

AustralianMakeup,327d0g,neodeone,3,Sun Apr 12 03:36:10 2015 UTC,"your look is really simple and fresh, I like it :) I'm seconding the cool toned contour but I would also recommend tight lining your upper lashline with a black or brown eyeliner just to make your lashes look thicker and give your eyes more definition :)"
AustralianMakeup,327d0g,pondicus,3,Sat Apr 11 07:29:08 2015 UTC,"Aww cool! I really like this understated look - it's 'no makeup' makeup, but still nice and glowy.   Maybe the only CC I have is to apply a tinted balm and improve your blush application. I'd say apply it slightly under your cheek and towards the sides of your face instead of directly to the front if that makes sense? If you're unsure, do a Warhead face (you know those lollies?) and where your cheeks push inwards, apply along that curve. Hope that makes sense!  Other than that - love it. It's really lovely!"

AustralianMakeup,327d0g,elfies_,1 point,Sat Apr 11 14:32:14 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty much same in opinion here with the lip balm, but yeah maybe apply the blush a tad higher on the contours of your cheekbones (think warhead face) so that there aren't any natural shadows under your cheeks. Otherwise i love love love your eyebrows, what did you use??"

I'd second the other suggestions that have been made, and also echo the request for a berry lip shade. That lip colour on you is pretty but maybe a little icy for your skin tone?  But I'd also like to recommend Redhead Revolution to you - all their products are aimed at the fair of skin and red of head and I think some of their colours would suit you well.

AustralianMakeup,326tbl,gospursgo_,4,Sat Apr 11 02:35:07 2015 UTC,"Rimmel Provocalips. Best long lasting lipstick I've tried! It's a two part liquid lipstick with a colour and a gloss that goes over the top, and I find that I need to reapply the clear gloss after eating sometimes, but it's amazing. You'll need an oil to remove it. I have both of the red shades: Play With Fire is a dark red and Kiss Me You Fool is a lighter bright red.  I also like Australis velourlips in NY-CEE which is a matte bright red shade, but it isn't as long lasting or transfer proof as provocalips."
AustralianMakeup,326tbl,xenomorphic_acid,3,Sat Apr 11 04:37:04 2015 UTC,"With long wear, I find personally that you get what you pay for, IMHO.  What sort of price point are you looking at? Velourlips is good and cheap, but can still wear off under the right circumstances, Melted is an excellent formula and usually needs reapplying after 6-7ish hours (although their pinks seems to need it in under 4) and Guerlain Rouge G is top of the line, really expensive but you only need one swipe for basically all day coverage."

AustralianMakeup,322x1r,Jessijames,2,Fri Apr 10 03:50:26 2015 UTC,I actually prefer the Maybelline texture! The Maybelline formula is my HG from the drugstore - creamy and somewhat thick but you can't feel it on your lips and very smooth (?) when you rub your lips together and not drying! I could rave forever on about the formula
AustralianMakeup,322x1r,szarkasm,1 point,Fri Apr 10 05:22:32 2015 UTC,"Seconding OP's comment about the Maybelline formula. Very impressive formula that is so smooth and creamy, doesn't feel drying."

AustralianMakeup,3231jz,hellowthere1,1 point,Fri Apr 10 04:15:05 2015 UTC,"I won a $150 voucher from there because I entered one of the site's competitions. I bought their 8gm powder mineral foundation in ivory (NC15). I find it gives pretty good coverage - I have slight redness on the top of my cheeks and very dark undereye circles -  and it is very lightweight. It is the only powder foundation I own as I prefer liquid so I can't really compare it to anything else. I think it is quite expensive for what it is but I suppose you are paying for herbal/mineral/ethics of the company.    I also bought an eyeshadow trio, eye shadow brush and the facial mitt. Love the facial mitt and eye shadow brush but haven't really used the eyeshadow trio much. Site is legit though. :)"

AustralianMakeup,31ujn8,chubbybubbys,11,Wed Apr 8 06:57:39 2015 UTC,"I'd say foundation, especially if you have a hard-to-match colouring (Nars Sheer Glow for me~). That or blush. The pricer ones do seem to beat the cheaper ones out of the park."
AustralianMakeup,31ujn8,Nikaa,2,Wed Apr 8 09:19:42 2015 UTC,I completely agree with this! The new Nars Luminous Weightless Foundation is worth every hard earned penny and the range of shades that high end foundations offer if incomparable to drug store brands.
AustralianMakeup,31ujn8,kittysayshi,7,Wed Apr 8 15:15:44 2015 UTC,I have a weakness for high-end lipstick despite drugstore ones being on par in terms of quality. I'm keeping my beloved NARS Audacious lipsticks

AustralianMakeup,31ujn8,Tonkie,3,Wed Apr 8 08:34:50 2015 UTC,"Anita, Barbara & Audrey so far, but I'm eyeing Vera and Vivien. I've stuck mostly to nudes so I can justify my purchase by wearing them everyday"
AustralianMakeup,31ujn8,fuzzboo,2,Wed Apr 8 09:03:36 2015 UTC,That seems smart! Those nuder colours are not very flattering on me but they do look like they would wear nicely!
AustralianMakeup,31ujn8,Tonkie,1 point,Wed Apr 8 10:59:02 2015 UTC,Which drugstore lipsticks would you say are on par in terms of quality?
AustralianMakeup,31ujn8,ailurosly,2,Thu Apr 9 10:44:08 2015 UTC,"My favourite drugstore lipsticks are the Rimmel Kate ones & the Maybelline Color Sensational Bold Mattes.  In terms of similarity to the NARS Audacious formula, I'd recommend a Korean brand: 3CE. Their Lip Colors have a bit more tug when applying but they wear very similarly on the lips."
AustralianMakeup,31ujn8,fuzzboo,6,Fri Apr 10 01:28:28 2015 UTC,"Pretty much anything Hourglass, but I would say blush because it's the most unique product in the range."
AustralianMakeup,31ujn8,Tonkie,5,Wed Apr 8 07:55:28 2015 UTC,I'd say that the Models Prefer Soft Touch blushes are pretty similar

AustralianMakeup,31ujn8,Tonkie,5,Wed Apr 8 10:32:08 2015 UTC,Georgio Armani Luminous Silk Foundation. It's $92 worth of satin finish goodness. Soo expensive but such nice high end foundation.
AustralianMakeup,31ujn8,ncln,3,Wed Apr 8 10:14:22 2015 UTC,"Oh my god, I remember when I first got colour matched for this foundation - I almost cried at the time and politely told the sales assistant thank you I'll think about it, then slinked off to Chanel where it was slightly cheaper."
AustralianMakeup,31ujn8,pondicus,5,Wed Apr 8 12:45:42 2015 UTC,"A really good primer. You can find pretty good foundations in priceline, but a good primer makes them looks excellent. Probably Hourglass or NARS' oil free."
AustralianMakeup,31ujn8,hankdiggles,3,Wed Apr 8 09:23:07 2015 UTC,I agree. Hourglass primer 15+ was the best  money I ever spent. You dont need much and it just flows so nicely. I would also recommend Nars sheer glow for excellent coverage.
AustralianMakeup,31ujn8,ihaveacutepuppy,3,Wed Apr 8 20:04:53 2015 UTC,All Occassion blush. Personally I find there is a huge difference between drugstore and high end blush.

AustralianMakeup,31ujn8,breviloquent-,1 point,Wed Apr 8 21:43:28 2015 UTC,Is this at Myer/DJs? How do you find the wear time of the lipsticks if I can ask?
AustralianMakeup,31ujn8,smilingsunbeams,2,Wed Apr 8 22:50:32 2015 UTC,"Not sure about David Jones but definitely at Myer! I have a few of the lipsticks, and it really just depends on the formula- however I find they're all really creamy, even slippery. The rouge pur couture (I have #1) is super staining, but does need touch ups, although that being said I'm a super messy eater etc. My one complaint about it is that I find it feathers, and really needs a good lip liner especially if you have ridges around your mouth from ageing, or like me, healed ecezma. I have found they're definitely not a lipstick (at least not in super bright pigmented colours) that you can bang on, but they do last and they smell amazing. The rouge volupte shine are most every day, more sheer and don't need a lip liner, but aren't that long lasting (although again that could just be my eating style, general fussiness). And the rouge volupte (No shine) are like the pur couture in that they're super pigmented, creamy and lasting. I've also used the kiss + blush and it is amazing. I guess it just comes down to what you prefer- I generally much prefer slippery, creamy lipsticks to dry (and much praised) lipsticks like MAC."

I have combination skin too; the Luminous Weightless is my go-to, everyday foundation (more of a matte finish but can be made glowy with the right primer and moisturiser, really buildable over my acne, great lasting power etc), but I prefer the Sheer Glow when my C-zone is really dry as the Luminous can be a bit clingy on dry spots.   They're both silicone based, come in a number of pink tones and are around $60 at Mecca. They also aren't heavily perfumed which tends to break me out/irritate my skin (I'm looking at you, YSL Touche Éclat)."

Only problem is that the lightest colour is not very light. I've got combination skin and it's really nice. Doesn't budge, particularly if you use the all in one corrector underneath.

AustralianMakeup,31ujnb,thexcheshirexcat,1 point,Wed Apr 8 09:57:54 2015 UTC,Yeah it sure is! I could also use it as a concealer somedays

AustralianMakeup,31sr9y,score1fortheprincess,2,Tue Apr 7 21:45:25 2015 UTC,I bought Illamasqua Cream Pigment in Hollow. I only bought it last week but my contouring game has seriously been up-ed since I started using it. I'm fair too (NW15 possibly lighter) and it is the perfect cool toned contour colour
AustralianMakeup,31sr9y,roseilluminate,2,Wed Apr 8 01:00:39 2015 UTC,"I am grabbing one of the Particle Contour Sticks from Life's Entropy to try out, I haven't used a cream contour before and these are quite reasonably priced so I figure it's no big loss if it's not great or I can't get the hang of it haha"
AustralianMakeup,31sr9y,Jessijames,1 point,Tue Apr 7 22:25:13 2015 UTC,Oo I think I got a sample of that with my order. I wonder where I put it haha
AustralianMakeup,31sr9y,Jessijames,1 point,Tue Apr 7 22:47:51 2015 UTC,"Hahaha! Well, I have faith I will like it - everything I've tried from LE has been great! I am grabbing some of their Brow Theory samples too so I can compare them to the ABH. At the very least, a contour stick from LE will help me learn while not shelling out just yet! If you do find it, let me know what you think! :)"

A few dots and pat it in with my fingers, slowly building up and looks like the most natural contour.  It's slightly warm but I feel like that's what makes it look so great because straight up greys can sometimes look fake and muddy whereas this warms up your complexion a bit."

AustralianMakeup,31paxh,purple_pear,9,Tue Apr 7 02:23:04 2015 UTC,I think Mecca/ MAC/ KIT is probably your best bet for a one-stop shop. They are generous in allowing you multiple samples from different brands.  Not sure if DJ's or Myer give you samples but they colour match.  Sephora is coming to Chadstone soon btw!
AustralianMakeup,31paxh,backwards01,2,Tue Apr 7 02:28:42 2015 UTC,"That's good to know, thank you! I'm thinking at this stage I'll be taking a trip to mecca :)"

AustralianMakeup,31oykd,Jessijames,3,Tue Apr 7 00:34:54 2015 UTC,I was under the impression that the Fyrinnae online store wasn't taking orders until they got up to date with their recent rush?
AustralianMakeup,31oykd,RipperReeta,1 point,Tue Apr 7 01:28:22 2015 UTC,Yeah there's a note up the top saying the store is closed temporarily. Hopefully it only lasts a few days?
AustralianMakeup,31oykd,xenomorphic_acid,1 point,Tue Apr 7 01:31:17 2015 UTC,"Yes I have just noticed that, I had seen they were having a big delay but didn't realise the store was on hold -  but hopefully it is back up in the next week or two - the orders likely won't be placed until at least next week to allow everyone to pay and if those purchasing from Fyrinnae are happy to wait until they're open there's not really much issue :)"
AustralianMakeup,31oykd,xenomorphic_acid,1 point,Tue Apr 7 01:44:51 2015 UTC,Just spotted that - as in my post below I knew they had a big delay happening but hasn't realised they were closed as well. Thanks for the heads up! :)
AustralianMakeup,31lq3h,xenomorphic_acid,41,Mon Apr 6 06:30:01 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm naive but having worked in retail I thought this was pretty standard practice? Most price match guarantees are usually only on full price items and not sale prices, otherwise they would end up losing money every time anywhere had a sale or discount.  I agree they should definitely specify that in their terms and conditions though! Sorry the shop assistants were rude, their hands are tied by the store's policies but rudeness is a bit unnecessary."
AustralianMakeup,31lq3h,Twerkle-Belle,1 point,Mon Apr 6 08:56:47 2015 UTC,"It depends on the retailer. Some have exclusions that specifically refer to liquidation sales or online only stores, or take into account the cost of shipping. However, Chemist Waterhouse have no exclusions listed anywhere in their store, and their policies online are a) conflicting with regard to pharmacies and online and b) don't mention excluding sale prices at all.  Her hands may have been tied by store policy... But she couldn't give me any evidence of the store policy at all, and it conflicted with the pharmacist's version of the store policy as well. I've worked in retail, we knew our policies very well but for new people or if we forgot, we had them on signs for people to read and refer to."
AustralianMakeup,31lq3h,livinginthewing,7,Mon Apr 6 09:19:01 2015 UTC,"Ugh speaking as someone working at Chemist Warehouse I can say that we aren't told what the store policy is for price matching or even for returns really :/   For example, at my store our official policy is only return if the product is faulty or was sold under false premises but my store manager often returns stuff for people who buy the wrong thing or kick up enough of a fuss. How strictly we have to adhere to the rules varies a LOT from store to store, and given we can work in different stores week to week it's not that fun of a time :/"
AustralianMakeup,31lq3h,livinginthewing,1 point,Mon Apr 6 13:25:13 2015 UTC,"That sucks, it must be so frustrating, but I guess it explains why I got different information from each person. :(  I guess I can understand the manager going beyond the official policy and  more lenient, but hopefully customers wouldn't expect it if it's not official."
AustralianMakeup,31lq3h,annimus_prime,2,Mon Apr 6 13:46:24 2015 UTC,"It is pretty frustrating, but I get off pretty easy; I'm the lowest level of pharmacy assistant, and not authorised to make returns/exchanges or discount an item below a certain percentage of its price. If a customer needs one of those things, I have to pass them off to a co-worker :/"
AustralianMakeup,31lq3h,Flippantry,12,Tue Apr 7 00:56:12 2015 UTC,"I went to my local Chemist Warehouse for 2 packs of Sally Hansen nail effects that were sitting in a tub marked $3 however they scanned up as $5 each. I said that they were marked as $3 each and if they could make sure and no joke, I am not even making this up, the sales girl said, ""no, I don't want to waste my time."" I wish, I wish, I wish I had asked for the manager or supervisor then and there but I was seriously so dumbfounded at her comment and how extremely rude it was. I just gave her a wtf look and walked out of the store. I did send an angry email later that day but nothing came of it except for a 'we are forwarding your email to the specific store' reply email. I honestly couldn't believe it. I hate thinking about it because it is so infuriating."
AustralianMakeup,31lq3h,gospursgo_,16,Mon Apr 6 11:36:07 2015 UTC,"I would probably send their team an email about your experience.  Regardless of their policy, the employee shouldn't have been needlessly rude and it might prompt them to better clarify their price matching policy.   Considering how often they have 50% off deals for the few brands they have, I find it unusual that an employee was so adamantly against the suggestion."
AustralianMakeup,31lq3h,nixedreamer,2,Mon Apr 6 08:13:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah the rudeness really didn't help at all, it made the whole thing really awkward.  Given what /u/Tofufufufu found in their FAQ it's not clear at all so I'm definitely going to email them, and I think I will also complain about the first staff member but I'll make it clear that the pharmacist was professional."
AustralianMakeup,31lq3h,alleeexxxx,15,Mon Apr 6 08:36:52 2015 UTC,"I disagree with you, if she's having a bad day- she shouldnt bring that into work, and u/xenomorphic_acid said she's being rude....so not really doing her job. u/X_A should be able to complain if she was dissatisfied (understatement by the sound of it) with the service she received without being guilt tripped!"
AustralianMakeup,31lq3h,ermagerdunicawns,5,Mon Apr 6 09:20:15 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying, but as I've said elsewhere, I don't want anyone fired, not at all. I really see the problem as a company one, because if the policy were clear and provided to staff it wouldn't matter who was having a bad day. If that makes sense."
AustralianMakeup,31lq3h,Joolebear,3,Mon Apr 6 09:22:55 2015 UTC,"She's not going to get fired over one customer complaint, they would just take her aside and remind her how to do her job. If she is getting regular complaints then they might fire her."

AustralianMakeup,31lq3h,Haibarai,3,Mon Apr 6 14:29:07 2015 UTC,"Generally, we lose money on those sales and it takes a long time to verify the price, which can be a bit annoying."
AustralianMakeup,31lq3h,Twerkle-Belle,1 point,Mon Apr 6 08:22:38 2015 UTC,"Goodness, you'd think they'd be happy to make a sale when there's competitive pricing going on. I personally never knew about Chemist Warehouse's price match policy before someone mentioned it on another reddit thread a few weeks ago but the SAs I've dealt with at my local CW were pretty nice regarding exchanges for broken packaging/wrong foundation shade (unused and the latter sealed)."
AustralianMakeup,31lq3h,reddit-g,5,Tue Apr 7 00:42:03 2015 UTC,Choice did a review on lowest price and price match guarantees and showed Chemist Warehouse to have no specified tricky terms/exclusions. So I guess it's pretty open.
AustralianMakeup,31lq3h,Twerkle-Belle,1 point,Mon Apr 6 11:42:45 2015 UTC,"Thankyou for this link! Not only does it outline various price match policies, it talks about ACL. :)"
AustralianMakeup,31lq3h,Twerkle-Belle,11,Mon Apr 6 13:11:19 2015 UTC,"This might be a naive observation but I honestly don't understand why these sales people get upset because its not like the company is yours or anything, wouldn't it be better if you could help people get better deals and save money?"
AustralianMakeup,31lq3h,DAT_CANKLE,18,Mon Apr 6 13:39:00 2015 UTC,The store might not be theirs but their jobs could be jeopardised if they go against company policy. They could also lose their job for being rude to customers though!
AustralianMakeup,31lq3h,Stinkysnarly,6,Mon Apr 6 08:31:13 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. I've had several frustrated customers take it out on me because I'm not willing to sway from company policy because I don't want to get in trouble for it (things like we need a receipt to refund unless it's faulty, can't mark it down below half price unless head office says so, etc). It's not excuse for you to be rude to a customer, but it can be very frustrating when people don't understand that you're just following the rules."
AustralianMakeup,31lq3h,missbo,3,Mon Apr 6 09:00:15 2015 UTC,I certainly wouldn't want anyone to lose their job! Just for less rudeness and for the company to actually honour their claims.
AustralianMakeup,31lq3h,Tofufufufu,3,Mon Apr 6 22:42:28 2015 UTC,"Of course! Just offering another perspective :)  I don't  think you were unreasonable at all for asking them to specify. They should know their policy better, at least enough to stand behind it and justify why they can't  honour a deal. And it should be clearly outlined, at least in the fine print. Good on you for sticking to your guns."
AustralianMakeup,31lq3h,SEXPILUS,3,Mon Apr 6 09:26:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks :) I've been second guessing myself all afternoon... I mean it's just makeup. But I hate false or misleading advertising so much (background in retail, sales and marketing) it really grinds my gears and then being snapped at etc... Definitely don't want anyone fired though....I really see the problem as a company one, because if the policy were clear and provided to staff it wouldn't matter who was having a bad day. If that makes sense."

AustralianMakeup,31lvhs,makeup_lady,3,Mon Apr 6 08:48:11 2015 UTC,"I really like theiconic for clothes, and Femme Fatale Cosmetics (an indie) for makeup!

Also crushcosmetics, but I have no experience with them myself!"

AustralianMakeup,31lvhs,makeup_lady,1 point,Mon Apr 6 09:33:59 2015 UTC,Very fair and warm toned. I find a lot of lighter foundations are very pink on me
AustralianMakeup,31lvhs,Haibarai,1 point,Mon Apr 6 09:41:46 2015 UTC,"Revlon Colourstay in Buff! It's their lightest warm-toned shade and it works really well! If you want lighter coverage, Revlon Nearly Naked in Vanilla is the sister-shade."

AustralianMakeup,31moui,Jessijames,9,Tue Apr 7 01:52:21 2015 UTC,"It actually probably is the cheapest you could get - With the way the exchange rate currently is, you're best off to just buy from Mecca because it's pretty much on par with US prices making it pointless to order from the US IIRC :) If you spend over $75 at Mecca (which those 2 items you mentioned would be) you'll get free shipping too anyway!"
AustralianMakeup,31moui,sefie,1 point,Tue Apr 7 02:16:38 2015 UTC,Oh wow I didn't even take that into account lol I'm going to do that then :) thank you heaps!
AustralianMakeup,31moui,sefie,2,Tue Apr 7 03:04:44 2015 UTC,Kiss and Makeup NY sell both NARS and Smashbox at US prices with a flat shipping rate. It's worth checking if you have a bunch of stuff you want to order at once.  Just make sure you don't get screwed over with the exchange rate.
AustralianMakeup,31lo70,Pandarmonium,9,Mon Apr 6 06:04:10 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's just me, but isn't the Stila on the left in the last image, not the right? The right is the one that seems to have feathered and not be opaque?  Anyway, nice haul! Would love to see your thoughts on the Chi Chi sponge, I just picked up one today (my first of the BB-style sponges)."
AustralianMakeup,31lo70,Artemisian11,2,Mon Apr 6 14:26:13 2015 UTC,"Oh dang, my mistake! Thank you for pointing that out; fixed it!  As for the Chi Chi sponge, I normally use the original Beauty Blender (that I bought for about $20 from Sephora in America), which I love. I tried the Chi Chi sponge today, doing half face with the BB and the other half with Chi Chi, and found there really wasn't that much difference between the two.  They both give a really natural, 'skin-like' finish and are super easy to use, whether you're using a light BB cream or wanting to layer and blend a foundation to full coverage. As long as you absolutely drench the sponge and then wring it out completely before you use it, you'll be good to go. Also, put the foundation on your face, not on the sponge. I made that mistake the first time I used the BB, and ended up with more foundation soaked into the sponge than on my face.  Considering the price difference ($6 Chi Chi vs $20-$30 BB), I won't hesitate to grab another Chi Chi sponge when my Beauty Blender bites the dust. I know RT also has a sponge that people seem to like, but tbh I can't see it being especially amazing that it justifies paying $15+ for it vs the Chi Chi."
AustralianMakeup,31lo70,Artemisian11,1 point,Tue Apr 7 12:48:53 2015 UTC,"That's very reassuring to hear. The main reason I've never tried that kind of application is because, like you said, I feel like so much product would just get wasted on the sponge. So thank you very much for that tip! Also happy to know I didn't waste my money (not that it was much, but still ... principle of the matter)."

The same brushes are only $43 on Iherb.com, compared to $104 at priceline.. ouch. Even if you wanted to buy the 2 sets of mini brushes it's still only $63 and $4 postage (and it only takes a few days to arrive!)   Sorry to be a Debbie downer but I like to spread the word because it's just a crazy price difference and I think people should know.    On another note, the velourlips colour is gorgeous! I hear so many positive reviews but it just does not agree with my lips :( I hate how they feel and it sucks so much because they have such beautiful colours."

I actually completely forgot about iherb until reading this post (I have it bookmarked and everything, derp). I think I just got so excited walking into Priceline for the first time this year with money to burn (pay day is the bomb), that I was just like ""BUY ALL THE THINGS"". At least I got 2 mini sets for free, I guess? :S  That sucks about the Velourlips - I'm totally in love with them at the moment! Do you use the NYX Cream Mattes? They are pretty similar, but a lot less drying."
AustralianMakeup,31lo70,chocolatespeckle,3,Tue Apr 7 13:08:08 2015 UTC,Good post - enjoyed your commentary and reviews. You've also convinced me to get that Stila liner! The intensity of blackness and the complete lack of bleed in that pic is really striking. Thanks!

Once these bad boys come in, I'll do another swatch and review post so you can all see their amazingness!  Side note, if you haven't tried the BB Face Masks with Hyaluronic Acid from Daiso - DO IT! I use one usually once a week to a fortnight, leaving it on for an hour and then squeezing out the extra product and massaging it around my face. Not only does it leave my skin feeling suuuper fresh, smooth and hydrated, I notice a massive reduction in the uber redness I get around my nose. These babies are my HG face mask and only $2.80 for two!"
AustralianMakeup,31lo70,fuzzboo,2,Mon Apr 6 06:12:00 2015 UTC,Awesome haul! Loved your commentary and am definitely going to pick up those Daiso face masks next time I'm out as I've been looking for some hydrating face masks to use.   What was the offer at Priceline with the mini brush trios? I'd also love to know what you think of the stippling brush and silicone liner when you get a chance to use them. :)
AustralianMakeup,31lo70,deadpanorama,2,Mon Apr 6 06:52:10 2015 UTC,"So glad to have helped out! I hope you love the masks as much as I do! The instructions on the back say only to leave them on for 5-15 minutes, but I wear them for an hour and the mask will still have extra product in it.  And yes, the mini brush trio was from Priceline (at Garden City Mt Gravatt, Brisbane, if that means anything to anyone). I don't remember seeing any signs about it, but when I came up to the counter with $150 worth of products, the assistant just went ""Woah, you're getting freebies for this!"". It was a nice surprise!  I'm thinking about doing a separate post about the Real Technique brushes since I must have at least 10 of them by now. I'm also interested to see how the silicone liner works - such a unique brush!"
AustralianMakeup,31lo70,fuzzboo,1 point,Mon Apr 6 07:10:36 2015 UTC,"That's a really nice surprise!

Totally cute and perfect to throw in your hand bag for any touch ups through out the day.  Aw, that sucks about Daiso :( If you're interested, I wouldn't mind sending a face mask pack down your way if you can pay for postage?"

What am I doing wrooooonggggg??? :(((("
AustralianMakeup,31lo70,paradoxgirl44,1 point,Mon Apr 6 08:30:29 2015 UTC,"Whaaat, seriously?! I used the sponge for the first tonight, so I'll definitely be checking it over the next couple days for mould! You should try contacting Chi Chi or Target - perhaps they'll reimburse you.  I haven't tried the Daiso cleaner though. Maybe it reacted strangely with the sponge? I've been using the original Beauty Blender sponge for over a year and never had an issues with it (I clean it with Johnson's Baby Shampoo)."

I thought it was too dark, but the other day I wore it to work and I felt white as. I've got B40 for crying out loud! Then yesterday I tried it again and I felt like it was way too pink. I dunno, I'm going to keep trying, cause I want to like it. I like how it makes parts of my face look, just not the overall look. I feel your pain."
AustralianMakeup,31ln8a,gospursgo_,2,Mon Apr 6 06:17:27 2015 UTC,"YES!!!! it kept changing colour on me, it oxidises badly. the BD undertones are still pinky imo! GAH. keen to try the new ink one and hopefully the shades are better."
AustralianMakeup,31ln8a,fuzzboo,4,Mon Apr 6 06:25:56 2015 UTC,Ditto to the Hourglass Ambient Lighting Palette. I just can't justify spending that amount on something I'd only wear on special occasions :(
AustralianMakeup,31ln8a,firsttimemidwife,3,Mon Apr 6 06:05:32 2015 UTC,"I think that is part of what is holding me back also. The packaging is so lush, and the lovely Mecca girl tried it on me in store and I loved it, but I know I wouldn't use it every day. Given that I have so many things in my makeup bag already that I don't use, I can't reconcile buying another thing to add to the pile of disused products. Maybe I need to set myself a challenge to use different products."

In saying that, it's pretty shit to use as a highlighter. The third colour is orange and I sometimes use it as a bronzer. IMO not worth it, stick with one shade as a finishing powder on its own."

AustralianMakeup,31ln8a,chocolatespeckle,3,Mon Apr 6 22:43:13 2015 UTC,Ooooh how much space does Reddit have for me to list everything? My wish list isn't comprised of newely released items but stuff that has been out for a while (team slow to discover make up here)   The biggies that I will probably cave and buy soon because I have no self-control are  --Nars Luxembourg and Het Loo lip pencils  --Chanel ‘Rouge Allure’  lipstick shade 39   --Kevyn Aucoin celestial bronzing viel in tropical nights  -- MAC sun power bronzer  -- NARS Madly and Gaiety blush

AustralianMakeup,31ln8a,pyjamasquid,3,Mon Apr 6 13:24:04 2015 UTC,"What a great wishlist! I've splurged a lot on makeup in the last year and to be honest there's not much left that I reallly want. I have so much makeup and I lot of it is only lightly used, so I'm trying to curb my spending and shop my stash. I think most of these items below will just stay on my wishlist for a long time... except for the fan brush because it's very affordable and I don't have anything like it :)  From your list I've tried the Hourglass ALP and the RT Setting brush. Love the Hourglass ALP, although you may find that you're better off finding 1-2 colours in the normal full size powders and just getting those, depending on what you want to use the powders for. It's a great palette though, and well worth the price. Also Incandescent Light is my favourite and it's exclusive to the palette! The RT Setting brush I love and use with my Hourglass ALP every day!  Mecca:   UD Naked Basics 2 Hourglass Ambient Lighting Blush in Radiant Magenta Hourglass Ambient Lighting Powder in Diffused Light   iHerb:   EcoTools Fan Brush Real Techniques Sculpting Brush   Priceline:   Bourjois Healthy Mix Serum   Sephora:   Tarte blush in Exposed   OH and if we can add things on our wishlist that aren't even sold anymore... NARS Douceur ;_;"

Or at least, I assume so - I just bought one myself over the weekend (along with Almeria); my order hasn't gone through yet due to the holidays but I received a confirmation! I have ordered other NARS products from them before and they're good (although shipping is slow)."
AustralianMakeup,31ln8a,Artemisian11,2,Tue Apr 7 04:03:34 2015 UTC,"I didn't even think to check there, thank you! :D I'm balking at the idea of paying $10 to ship one blush, but I should probably just do it before this becomes one of things I forever regret not buying, lol. I just googled Almeria and it's gorgeous as well! I really love muted rosey coloured blushes :)"
AustralianMakeup,31ln8a,chocolatespeckle,1 point,Wed Apr 8 04:11:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's not the best deal with the conversion rate right now, but I really wanted Douceur and I couldn't find it anywhere else.

AustralianMakeup,31ln8a,pootlepower,1 point,Mon Apr 6 14:42:59 2015 UTC,"That's something I hadn't thought of. I should look into getting maybe one or two of the ALPs. Thanks!   Also, whatever you do, buy Naked 2. I bought it last week, and I can't stop wearing it. I have subbed a few of my staple MAC eyeshadows in while doing more daytime looks, but I am so so happy I bought it. The quality of the shadows is unreal and there are so many different colours. Gotta say, I am on a bit of a matte eyeshadow bender (and a liquid/cream/dewy face bender) at the moment, so my favourite colour is Tease. The whole palette is well worth it.  EDIT: I'm such a dud. I didn't read that right, you want Naked Basics 2. My husband has bought it for me for my birthday this month, I'm so excited."
AustralianMakeup,31ln8a,Haibarai,3,Mon Apr 6 07:37:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah like /u/The_Sick said in another comment, Radiant Light is quite orange and while I also use it as a bronzer sometimes, it's not ideal. Especially with the shimmer!   Haha luckily I do already own the Naked 2 and love it! I'm also really digging matte eyeshadows right now... which is why the Naked Basics 2 is calling my name.

AustralianMakeup,31ln8a,WarlockPanda,2,Mon Apr 6 07:15:51 2015 UTC,"Definitely go get matched in store and bring home lots of samples if you can. Then you can figure out wear time and what finish you prefer, plus how the foundation formula sits on your skin.  It took me one too many pink and orange undertone foundations (aka all the drugstore foundations) to figure out I was yellow AF - only NARS and Bourjois make foundation yellow enough for me! That and Japanese BB creams."

Clinique's Cheek Pops in Rosy, Pansy, Fig and Melon Pop - they all look so cute and pretty! Temptalia's reviews are always so good for this product.  I've also got a whole bunch of perfumes from indie brand, Deep Midnight, on my list. And still got my eyeballs peeled for indie brand Sixteen92's Talia fragrance, which was a limited edition indie subscription box addition aka IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND - the notes are ""vanilla, soft musk, moss, fern, and stone.""  Edit - I did buy a bunch of Innisfree and My Beauty Diary sheet masks, plus Hada Labo's AHA/BHA foaming cleanser today - eBay is dangerous when you need to replace things, but I stuck to my guns!"

AustralianMakeup,31ie3m,Mobiuscontinuum,4,Sun Apr 5 11:08:03 2015 UTC,When I asked everyone really seemed to like the essence gel pencil liners :)
AustralianMakeup,31ie3m,hellojimm,2,Sun Apr 5 16:46:35 2015 UTC,Make sure you don't get a dud one. Purchased one after sampling them in store since it glided on the back of my hand. The one I picked up was so dry x_x
AustralianMakeup,31ie3m,Unlumpyspaceprincess,1 point,Sun Apr 5 23:58:28 2015 UTC,How do you sharpen them?
AustralianMakeup,31ie3m,girlyadvice,1 point,Mon Apr 6 01:28:14 2015 UTC,They're the twisty type ones. (Can't think of the proper name)
AustralianMakeup,31ie3m,Unlumpyspaceprincess,1 point,Mon Apr 6 04:22:08 2015 UTC,Haha I know they twist up but I don't know how to get a point back on mine :(
AustralianMakeup,31ie3m,girlyadvice,2,Mon Apr 6 07:36:17 2015 UTC,"Oh my gosh I ran into this problem earlier today! I know some retractable eyeliners come with a little plastic sharpener thing that's built into the bottom of the pencil which you can pull out and use. But the essence eyeliner doesn't have one nor does any of my other pencils, damn!  I did some googling and found this tip very useful, a lot of product wastage though so I'd rather have that little sharpener thing...   http://www.anonymousmallu.com/2013/02/26/how-to-sharpen-a-retractable-eyelinerlipliner/"

Doesn't transfer to my lower lash line/inner rim and you can wiggle the brush between the lashes. I've tried pencils but this is definitely my favourite method!
AustralianMakeup,31ie3m,thexcheshirexcat,2,Mon Apr 6 01:31:52 2015 UTC,Laura Mercier tightlining cake! I just got it and the flat tightlining brush and love it. Super long-wearing and doesn't run like Rimmel Scandaleyes.
AustralianMakeup,31ie3m,magicnails,2,Sun Apr 5 21:09:06 2015 UTC,Models prefer 101 dual liner/brow brush. Picked this up in the sale on a whim and it's amazing! I use it with ben nye cake liner but it also works with gel liner or eye shadow. Cannot get over how great this brush is.

AustralianMakeup,31ie3m,_cephei,2,Mon Apr 6 03:07:59 2015 UTC,"I really like the Urban Decay 24/7 Glide-On Eye Pencil in 'Perversion' (super black). It's a little pricey at $30 from Mecca Maxima, but I find that once I apply it, it stays all day. Seriously, it takes a q-tip dipped in oil makeup remover and rubbed back and forth over my lash line to get that stuff off.  Also, if I tight line my upper waterline, I rarely get any transfer to my bottom lashline unless my eyes are super watery that day. On those days, I find going over the liner with a black eyeshadow can really help to seal the liner and keep it budge proof."
AustralianMakeup,31ie3m,Pandarmonium,2,Mon Apr 6 05:48:09 2015 UTC,"I swear by the essence gel eyeliner pencil in the darkest black shade.

I do not like the Retro Mattes though, I had Ruby Woo and maybe it was an older tube but it was super dry and stiff. I don't have problems with lipsticks ever but only Ruby Woo. I own 50 47 mac lipsticks. Most are nearly empty, I have been meaning to buy a palette to depot them into so I can cash them into back 2 mac. I like Snob, its probably my fave. However the Vanilla smell has warn off and now I don't like how it smells :( Wishlist: Snob, Twig, Myth, Honeylove, Pure Zen (:P) & LAVENDER JADE >:( Ruby Woo. :( I've gotten a few lustres and sold them straight away, same with most pinks, but I am moving away from red and pink lipsticks as a whole.   Yay! That was fun.  CAN I JUST SAY IVE BEEN WAITING FOR LAVENDER JADE FOR LIKE 6 MONTHS OR MORE AND IT SOLD OUT BEFORE I COULD GET IT."
AustralianMakeup,31e221,badassbettie,1 point,Sat Apr 4 04:50:22 2015 UTC,"Are the lustres like a frost type of finish? I must say, I'm not much of one for pink lipstick but Snob is also on my wishlist, I think it will be 'just right' for me! Pure Zen is a total winner, it is my go-to handbag staple as it goes with everything and is easy to just slap on without much hassle!  I also agree on Lavender Jade...It looks amazing, I really hope a whole bunch of people decide they want to trade and put their tubes up on MUE...  I have heard the retro mattes are awful so I am going to try to steer clear especially now! But holy hell...50 tubes? Damn girl! I'd be too scared to depot, I don't think I'd really keep using them all that much if I did and they'd go to waste -.-"
AustralianMakeup,31e221,badassbettie,1 point,Sat Apr 4 05:15:11 2015 UTC,"Uhm, I think they are the sheer type? I don't like frost finish either though. Snob is a great colour, I love it.

AustralianMakeup,31e221,chocolatespeckle,3,Sun Apr 5 03:27:02 2015 UTC,"Love Pure Zen on you! Totally agree with you on all the points about MAC lipsticks too. It's so hard to decide what to get when there's so many to choose from. Plus I'm not very good at knowing what suits my skin tone. >_<   I'm even newer to MAC lipsticks, purchasing my first 5 MAC lipsticks when I was in HK back in Feb (since they worked out to be about AU$22 each with the exchange rate)! I own (SWATCHES in the order they're listed below):   Cosmo (amplified creme) - Love the finish of this because it's so creamy and pigmented, but unfortunately I can't decide if I like how it looks on me so it hasn't gotten much use. Plumful (lustre) - it's sheer, got a bit of sheen, and luckily for me leans pretty plummy (from online swatches it seems a bit more pink for some people).  Please Me (matte) - My favourite of the 5. The matte finish is great if I have time to prep my lips, but generally it's not the lipstick I'm going to grab if I'm in a rush and know my lips are a bit dry that day. Just cos they can get a bit flaky sometimes... even though Please Me is a great every day kind of pink! I would just rather go for a chubby stick or something to keep it even easier lol.  Lady Danger (matte) - Haven't been brave enough to rock this one out yet, but it's such a gorgeous shade. I really think it would suit you :) Russian Red (matte)    Favourite formula so far is probably amplified creme, but Please Me gets the most wear. Wishlist: Heroine, Up the Amp, Twig and Captive!  The shade I regret most is probably Russian Red. For my first MAC purchase I just figured I had to get either the famous Russian Red or Ruby Woo, and since Ruby Woo swatched like a crayon in store I went with Russian Red! I regret it because I didn't realise just how similar it is to NARS Rita, and I really don't need that many red lipsticks :/ Here is a swatch with Russian Red on top and NARS Rita on the bottom."
AustralianMakeup,31e221,badassbettie,1 point,Sat Apr 4 05:43:30 2015 UTC,"Nice collection Speckle! Holy crap Cosmo is like a slightly pinker version of Faux...I NEED IT!

It does look lovely! & you've also only further convinced me I need Lady Danger in my life >.< hahaha  Ouch, strike 2 with the Ruby Woo, it's good thing I already have a few reds in identical tones! But you're right, i agree Russian Red & Rite look identical, I did the same when I got my last Sephora/Ulta haul, I bought 2 reds and when I got them they swatched and wore identical haha I was kicking myself!"
AustralianMakeup,31e221,StrattonLove,1 point,Sat Apr 4 05:49:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks :) I'm so confused about Cosmo. Definitely swatch it and walk around in different lightings to see how you like it. In daylight it looks like a lovely warm rose pink, but in my bathroom and in yellower indoor lighting it looks really peachy brown which I don't like so much.   Ooops I didn't realise you didn't want to be talked into it! :P   What reds do you have that are similar to Ruby Woo? Not that I need more red lipsticks... but y'know... just in case."

AustralianMakeup,31e221,badassbettie,3,Sat Apr 4 06:45:09 2015 UTC,"I bought my first MAC lipsticks in September when there was IMATS Sydney. I only have two of their lipsticks in one formula:   Violetta (amplified) - This makes me look vampy without going dark. It's the only lipstick that receives compliments from the get-go.  Morange (amplified) - Great orange for summer but I find that I can only just pull off this orange because it's so bright.   I have not regretted any of my MAC choices. Completely regret my Dior Addict one though. Great formula but not for a wine red.  I want to get more of their matte lipsticks -- particularly Velvet Teddy and the popular reds (Russian Red, Ruby Woo, Lady Danger) but I'm not sure which one to go for with the reds. I'm ~NW25 in the summer.  I've been hesitant to get more lipsticks because I have a lot... just 10. More than enough for the average girl, not by makeup addict proportions."

AustralianMakeup,31e221,Joolebear,2,Sun Apr 5 04:35:06 2015 UTC,"I only have three mac lipsticks:  Syrup (lustre): pretty close to my natural lip colour. Doesn't last that long on me, but its pretty good if I want a minimalistic and natural look.  Rebel (satin): pretty much my go to when I want to wear a bold lip. Wears much longer than lush life and more opaque.  Lush life (mineralize rich): looks almost exactly like rebel on my lips, but the finish is much more forgiving on dry lips.  I wanted to try a matte red after I lost smashbox in infrared matte. I can't decide if I want russian red or ruby woo."

AustralianMakeup,31e221,WarlockPanda,2,Sat Apr 4 10:40:57 2015 UTC,I'm not familiar enough with the Mac shades to know what finishes you have you have but their cremesheen formula is brilliant! It feels quite moisturising and pigmentation is great. My favourite is Modesty which is my perfect MLBB and so easy to wear for any makeup look and for work. I actually regret getting Creme Cup and Angel. They're raved about heaps but they make me look like I'm trying too hard with my makeup and my NC20 skin looks sallow when I wear them.

AustralianMakeup,31d7yb,smilingsunbeams,5,Fri Apr 3 23:33:59 2015 UTC,"I, personally wish /r/Aussiepolish was more active - in saying that I consider it under the umbrella of 'makeup'.  I haven't had the time or patience for my nails of late and have been neglecting them which is why I haven't done many posts over there lately. I'm really bummed at the low level of activity on that sub even though at the moment I'm not much of a contributor myself!  I presume they're 'allowed' but in the same token, I would prefer 'cosmetics' to be the majority and not have polish posts overtake the sub (although again with the state of aussiepolish its unlikely). I would actually prefer a hell of a lot more look posts and tutorials etc especially using products we can get here. It seems it's mostly sales and hauls that are getting posted which are great but I find look posts so much more valuable and entertaining! Maybe it's too intimidating on here and people don't want to show their face? I hope that's not the case!"
AustralianMakeup,31d7yb,Jessijames,5,Sat Apr 4 00:06:53 2015 UTC,"I don't want to show my face, just because I value my anonymity, I am terrified (for no good reason) of someone recognising me!  I would like to get over that. Everytime I see one of your posts I give you a little cheer ""you go, JJ! ""  I try to contribute with different discussion, but I feel like everyone only wants to talk about priceline and that my choice to purchase and use 'non drugstore' makeup makes me a snob :("
AustralianMakeup,31d7yb,Tonkie,3,Sat Apr 4 02:22:08 2015 UTC,"Oh Tonkie, you're a sweetheart! Thank you :) I worry about posting sometimes because I'm one of not many that do and I don't want to flood the sub with my face too much haha >.<  I do figure a lot of the reason for there not being as many look posts is the anonymity thing which is more than a valid reason!   You are right there about the 'drugstore' thing, I find there's not a lot of discussion of brands/products outside of what Priceline etc offer and even I feel that vibe a lot too. As I have gotten more and more into makeup, the more mid/high end brands I try the more I find replacements for drugstore products I once loved! There's absolutely nothing wrong with drugstore brands, but more often than not I find that you get what you pay for with regards to higher end vs. drugstore. I'm most definitely not made of money, but I figure I work full time, I don't really go out a lot, I don't drink/smoke etc and that money I save by being a hermit by nature allows me to buy nice products here and there and I shouldn't have to feel bad or as you put it like a snob for that.."
AustralianMakeup,31d7yb,Jessijames,2,Sat Apr 4 02:40:33 2015 UTC,":) nah, we love your face:)  I'm in similar mind as you, makeup is my hobby,  and that's what I spend my disposable income on. I'd prefer one perfect knock out product that i love and I don't have to 'make work' than a bag of stuff that is 'pretty good'. But, everyone should do what makes them happy.  I spend 5-10 minutes on a ""full face"" in the morning, which is primer, foundation, powder, blush,  mascara, brows and lips, and I firmly believe that I can get good results in that time because I've invested in quality products."

I was just thinking last night that the front page of the sub was full of sale posts, but I can never think of anything good I could submit myself that would be different since I don't want to post my face!  I'd love to see more discussion about other brands/products too. Although I've always assumed the more mid/high end brands don't get talked about as much here because they're usually American brands so people head to /r/mua for that kind of discussion? :) Just a thought!

AustralianMakeup,31d7yb,Jessijames,1 point,Sat Apr 4 04:00:52 2015 UTC,"That's true! I'll try and do a swatch post soon! Sometimes I feel bad about swatching my lipsticks on my arm only, because I've definitely seen some complaints over on /r/muacjdiscussion etc about how arm swatches of lipsticks aren't very helpful since no one's lips are skin coloured! Obviously I can swatch other things though, so I'm thinking I might compare some of my favourite blushes...   Loved your MAC post btw :)"
AustralianMakeup,31d7yb,chocolatespeckle,1 point,Sat Apr 4 06:15:43 2015 UTC,"As much as lip swatches are helpful for those reasons, I actually don't mind arm swatches so long as the lighting/quality shows them as true to life as possible.

I don't feel comfortable posting my face on the internet full stop but I've noticed my EOTDs get initially downvoted a bit so I figured they weren't welcome here.
AustralianMakeup,31d7yb,Jessijames,3,Sat Apr 4 00:19:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's so bizarre but you're not the only one whose look posts are getting downvoted. It's just stupid really, not to mention downvotes being thrown around like candy here lately in general! I think a lot of people need to remember that the purpose of a downvote isn't for when you disagree or don't like what someone posts. I think this sub needs a gentle reminder of that!  & yes, a weekly thread or day of the week for us to post nail looks would be cool but part of me does see it as futile because it will only result in less traffic/posts being contributed to /r/aussiepolish - rock & a hard place I guess!"

I get so excited when I see new posts on this sub, especially when it's a look/eye of the day. :) I don't always comment though, but mostly because I am a massive lurker and feel awkward commenting sometimes when I have nothing interesting to add.  I was thinking it'd be great to have weekly discussion/free for all/catch up posts in this sub. We could either make it really general and open so everyone could discuss their lives, or make them more beauty focused - like what products you were loving this week, or what nail art you were rocking.

The fake, fluorescent lighting at priceline, myers etc gets me all the time, so many wasted money on lip products especially because I thought they looked a I colour I wanted..

AustralianMakeup,319ml1,badassbettie,4,Fri Apr 3 10:25:58 2015 UTC,Rimmel. I've always loved Rimmel. Especially lip products - dayum!   But the stay matte powder is just AWFUL as far as I'm concerned.
AustralianMakeup,319ml1,jamballdonut,5,Fri Apr 3 03:33:01 2015 UTC,I wasn't a fan either! Its SO hyped up as well :(
AustralianMakeup,319ml1,sydneysomething,2,Fri Apr 3 03:53:19 2015 UTC,I don't like most of the Stay Matte range tbh. I have the liquid  foundation but have to mix it with a metric ton of moisturizer to make it even remotely usable. I don't know if it's too oily or drying or what it is but it's just a no go for me
AustralianMakeup,319ml1,sydneysomething,1 point,Fri Apr 3 05:30:45 2015 UTC,"I honestly hated the powder too, but tried it with a new brush and holy gosh now it actually works, I don't get it?!"
AustralianMakeup,319ml1,Twerkle-Belle,3,Fri Apr 3 11:18:04 2015 UTC,I love Illamasqua so much but I hate how easy their pressed powder breaks and their cream concealer cannot be used as an actual concealer because it's so slippy and cakey. I tap it on my cheekbones because it is actually the one thing i've found that's light enough for a non shimmer highlight but I can't wear this under the eyes or on anything I want to actually conceal.
AustralianMakeup,319ml1,Twerkle-Belle,1 point,Fri Apr 3 04:26:07 2015 UTC,Cakey! Oh my god that was the word I was looking for. The only way I can describe makeup I don't like putting in my face was like...tacky?  Funnily enough that's exactly how I felt about the too faced concealer. I know they were probably going for super full coverage but the consistency of it...ugh!
AustralianMakeup,319ml1,makeupaficionado,1 point,Fri Apr 3 05:28:47 2015 UTC,I didn't even know they ever made liquid lipsticks? I knew they had like..3 different types of lipglosses for a while and I was like..why do you need so many?
AustralianMakeup,319ml1,Joolebear,4,Fri Apr 3 07:08:29 2015 UTC,"Benefit!   Oh man...up until the They're Real! Liner every product I had tried from them was amazing. I bought the liner on a whim thinking it was going to change my liner game forever. Boy was I wrong. It's difficult to apply, it drags, it dries so quickly it is really difficult to fix a mistake and it's SO HARD to remove! And when I do remove it, it crumbles into sharp little shards that hurt my eyes.  Benefit....how could you betray me like this?"
AustralianMakeup,319ml1,pootlepower,3,Sat Apr 4 02:16:56 2015 UTC,"Oh man I'm the opposite! I love They're Real as a liner, although getting the hang of us in it was a bit tricky, but I'm not that impressed by a lot of benefits other stuff.  Maybe because it's stocked in myer and they don't have the same pricing policy that mecca does so it's suuuper expensive"
AustralianMakeup,319ml1,pootlepower,1 point,Fri Apr 3 22:32:41 2015 UTC,"It is very expensive! I usually try and ask for samples before I buy a product from them. Maybe in the past I've just gotten lucky, but the liner has changed my view somewhat. A lot of other people have said the same thing so seems their products are a bit hit and miss.  I did end up finding a way to make They're Real! work for me, because for the price I was determined to get my money's worth! It's perfect if you get it right first go, but a nightmare to deal with if you mess up and want to try and fix it :(   I do love the idea of a pen though, I think if the formula was a little more liquid than gel it would be perfect for me. Maybe someone has a recommendation for a similar product?"
AustralianMakeup,319ml1,deadlypony,2,Fri Apr 3 23:39:25 2015 UTC,"I think the applicator is a bit to blame too, it's slightly too long or flexible or something? It was a very steep learning curve haha"
AustralianMakeup,319ml1,jamballdonut,1 point,Fri Apr 3 23:49:42 2015 UTC,Ooh i love this liner. It works best for me if i have the tiniest bit pushed up. Its th one liner i can 8/10 do cat wings pretty well.... It is annoying when you open it and somehow loads has pushed up overnight somehow. Doesn't happen all the time but such a waste when it does
AustralianMakeup,319ml1,jamballdonut,2,Sat Apr 4 04:29:43 2015 UTC,I actually found it kind of refreshing that they do something I don't like - has anyone felt the same?
AustralianMakeup,319ml1,enthaising,2,Sun Apr 5 08:21:42 2015 UTC,"I generally like L'Oreal products but I'm not too fond of their brow artist plumper.

AustralianMakeup,319ml1,Tomkhagai,2,Fri Apr 3 15:15:23 2015 UTC,"Ooo I can get on board this one! My other go to foundation when I want super full coverage is the dream matte mousse, but the colour matching! So frustrating!"

AustralianMakeup,31aje1,TooManyVitamins,3,Fri Apr 3 09:06:12 2015 UTC,"I've gotten samples from both before, you should probably hang around the counter for a while, look at products, get colour matched and just generally be nice and polite and show interest. obviously sales people don't want to give out free samples to grouchy people looking for free stuff haha"
AustralianMakeup,31aje1,neodeone,3,Fri Apr 3 09:27:46 2015 UTC,"Counters are often able to give samples, but a lot of the time they don't have sample pots to put them in. So it helps to bring your own just in case (sometimes a MAC counter is willing to give you an empty one, or else I found really good value at Daiso - 2.80 for 4 pots in a pouch with a little spatula)."
AustralianMakeup,31aje1,rebcart,2,Fri Apr 3 13:14:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've found that at my local David Jones the YSL counter doesn't carry sample pots but the Estee Lauder one does. Sometimes I get a really friendly sales rep who just runs over and grabs a sample pot from another counter, but sometimes I'll get a harsh one who looks me dead in the eye and says ""There are no pots here, there's nothing I can do"". It's hit and miss, so I'd carry pots with you just in case!"
AustralianMakeup,31aje1,walkyouhome,2,Fri Apr 3 21:27:17 2015 UTC,"Unless there's a promo for free samples going on, I find Myer in Doncaster and Melbourne CBD pretty stingy with their samples. They won't give you anything unless you've already bought something else from them (even if you ask very nicely and provide jars) and I usually walk away with the foundation matched on my face for the day but I don't go back and buy the full product because I need to know things like if it'll break me out after 1-2 days of consecutive use/ease of application etc. I've bought heaps more from Mecca because of their sample provision and excellent customer service."
AustralianMakeup,31aje1,Joolebear,1 point,Fri Apr 3 23:43:15 2015 UTC,I've gotten foundation samples from the MAC and Mecca Cosmetica stands in Myer Sydney on Pitt Street before.

AustralianMakeup,3163ss,Jessijames,4,Thu Apr 2 09:07:34 2015 UTC,"I wonder if the product in the secret compartment contributes to the weight given in the actual product. eg if the lipstick is 6g, the compartment has 1/2g and the actual lipstick has 5.5g."
AustralianMakeup,3163ss,Jessijames,3,Thu Apr 2 09:26:03 2015 UTC,"It would depend if the weight listed on the packaging says 'net' - net is the total weight of the product including all packaging (eg. the tube not the cardboard it comes in).  If it doesn't state net then it's purely the product weight not including the packaging, which means I don't have an answer for you if that's the case haha unless you scraped it all out meticulously from a brand new tube to weigh there's not way of knowing if the listed weight includes the bit at the bottom. One would presume not, as the bottom is not an 'advertised feature' nor is it common knowledge so it would dodgy/possibly illegal from a consumer affairs POV by misleading customers about the labelled weight of said product."
AustralianMakeup,3163ss,amyeh,1 point,Thu Apr 2 10:47:06 2015 UTC,"The label sticker says 2.8g net.  I still have no idea if it includes the secret compartment product, since the net weight doesn't include the tube packaging.  I suppose you would be able to figure it out if you had a scientific scale and cut the lipstick out.  If the secret product is ~25%, and the weight you're getting from the cut lipstick is ~2.1g, then it must be part of the net weight.   Which is dodgy as hell."
AustralianMakeup,3163ss,Unlumpyspaceprincess,2,Thu Apr 2 13:09:12 2015 UTC,I was certain net weight included packaging but I must have mis-remembered! :) I might have my comment around the wrong way lol
AustralianMakeup,3163ss,vociferocity,2,Thu Apr 2 19:07:31 2015 UTC,I think that would be gross weight. I always remember the difference by thinking about s fishing net - stuff falls through except for this bits you want to keep.
AustralianMakeup,3163ss,Tonkie,1 point,Sat Apr 4 12:33:48 2015 UTC,"I just checked, and lipstick rolled out is around 2cm long when new, and the secret compartment is around 0.5cm long.  They are different thicknesses, though, but I estimate that the compartment adds ~25% extra product.

Swap the Bali cap for the Maui or Vegas, and carry only one lipstick in your purse.  Since it's half empty, I think I will scrape out the ends of a few tins of lip balm and put them into the empty space.  From the outside it looks like the regular lipstick, when you pull out the compartment, it's lipbalm for touchups to stop the matte-ness from drying out your lips."

AustralianMakeup,316hg8,bam-bino-69,7,Thu Apr 2 11:13:49 2015 UTC,"depends what kind of powdering you want to do. if you want to precisely powder (ie just nose, under eyes etc) the real techniques setting brush is great. if you want to powder all over but only a light dusting then the models prefer powder brush or the manicare duo fibre stippling brush and if you want heavy duty then the real techniques powder brush or something like the sigma flat top kabuki work well."
AustralianMakeup,316hg8,neodeone,1 point,Thu Apr 2 12:05:22 2015 UTC,"I'm more after a setting brush, will have s look at the real techniques. I already own the sigma flat top kabuki and love it for liquid foundation application. Would have to wash it too often to use it for powder also :)"
AustralianMakeup,316hg8,enthaising,5,Thu Apr 2 22:07:19 2015 UTC,"I have the Real Techniques Core Collection (4 face brushes) and the Stippling Brush, I'm really pleased with the quality of them but if you do decide to buy them, I suggest buying online from iHerb since it's much cheaper (I think /r/AusSkincare has a referral thread going on at the moment). I've never tried Zoeva but I've only seen good reviews of their products from several bloggers."

No, I haven't had any shedding problems and I've had it for about 2 years, I mostly use it for liquid/cream face products but I must admit I haven't been using it lately now that I have the orange RT sponge. Maybe I got lucky, or maybe the newer ones aren't being made to the same standard."

AustralianMakeup,316hg8,Joolebear,2,Sat Apr 4 06:30:38 2015 UTC,I absolutely love the Eco Tools large powder. works wonders!
AustralianMakeup,316hg8,gospursgo_,2,Fri Apr 3 04:44:04 2015 UTC,I like using my elf kabuki face brush for setting my foundation. It's very dense and soft although I've heard of people getting bad batches where theirs shed. I've owned mine for a year and it hasn't shed at all. The furless pro3f powder brush is also quite dense and soft for setting powder. I actually use my real techniques powder brush for bronzing as it's not as dense as the other 2 brushes I mentioned.   Zoeva brushes can be hit or miss. I have the luxe complete set and I like their face brushes but their eyeshadow brushes are mediocre.
AustralianMakeup,314n9g,Dawlkins,6,Wed Apr 1 23:38:53 2015 UTC,"I like using a cleansing oil and just wash it off in the shower, and then when I get out I remove any last traces with micellar water"
AustralianMakeup,314n9g,amyeh,4,Thu Apr 2 01:04:03 2015 UTC,"I use plain old baby oil. Rub it on gently then wipe off with a warm damp cloth in the shower. Repeat for OCM. Lush also make a great oil-based cleanser called Ultrabland, use it in the same way as the baby oil but you don't need to repeat. It removes everything in the first go but is not drying whatsoever."

AustralianMakeup,314n9g,myhiddentreasureches,3,Sun Apr 5 09:01:58 2015 UTC,I use sweet almond oil to remove my make up.

AustralianMakeup,314n9g,Tomkhagai,2,Fri Apr 3 21:01:09 2015 UTC,"What's your budget?   I've sworn by Zoe Foster's brand Go To Properly Clean cleanser since she came out with it last year - it seriously does get everything off, is super gentle and doesn't aggravate my sensitive-dry skin. It's not cheap at $29.95 + shipping though :( Each bottle takes about 6 months to get through, so it works out for me and I'm on my second bottle. I thought it was pretty gimmicky at first aka beauty editor creates her own beauty brand, but yeah - surprisingly, it works.  I've also used Black Violet's super fruit creme cleanser (indie brand) which was okay - the essential oils in it worried me, but it was gentle enough. Innisfree minimal facial cleanser for sensitive skin is also a good one as it's the right pH for a cleanser - also very affordable off their global site. Very few ingredients and good in the shower too.  Hope that helps!"
AustralianMakeup,314n9g,CakeFaceKoala,3,Thu Apr 2 00:10:04 2015 UTC,I have been tossing up whether to buy the Go-To cleanser. Thank you! You have convinced me. I'm going to order it today.
AustralianMakeup,314n9g,CakeFaceKoala,2,Thu Apr 2 01:02:57 2015 UTC,"No worries! I really love it personally - her Exfoliating Swipies AHA wipes are also great, but so expensive for what they are, ugh. Still, it's lasted me about 6 months and counting. Her Very Useful Face Cream, which is super thick and moisturising is also brilliant. I had no success with her Exceptionoil though (it dried out my skin?!), so ended up destashing that to a friend who swears by it."
AustralianMakeup,314n9g,Tonkie,1 point,Thu Apr 2 01:36:06 2015 UTC,"Whats the link? Budget isnt to much of an issue considering the ASAP is $40+ for a bottle. I just want something that is easy, I can use in the shower (emphasis on easy because I shower with my almost 2 year old toddler) and that is gentle. I truly dont mind gimmicky either if it works."
AustralianMakeup,314n9g,ellie_girl,1 point,Thu Apr 2 01:20:17 2015 UTC,"Go To Skincare is the link. It's free shipping for purchases over $59. I also quite like her Very Useful Face Cream - again, I went into it really sceptical, but my skin is so smooth now. Insane.  I've also heard great things about Banila Clean It Zero, which is a mineral oil based cleansing balm in a jar. Rubyruby76 on eBay is a legit seller and it comes with a spatula - Google and /r/AsianBeauty bring up a lot of positive reviews too."

Or big drawers in your bathrooms?   My makeup case is a mess, so I'm not knocking this at all, I just can't see a way to make it work in my life. I'd love to be able to actually see and use all of my stuff, but right now it's spread over three separate cases and a brush roll, and I have no where to put something like this. I'd need at least 4-5 of these as a start.   I've taken to doing my makeup on the bed in the spare room in front of the wardrobe mirror so I can spread my products out a little bit."

AustralianMakeup,310wto,chocolatehistorynerd,2,Wed Apr 1 14:57:35 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure Chadstone would be considered inner suburbs on most sites. I'm sure I read something about it opening there. Guess I'm going to have to get over my hate of the place.

AustralianMakeup,310fdn,snailor,1 point,Wed Apr 1 05:14:16 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I should have thought harder before I typed the description! The smaller 'indie' size jars should be fine in letter mail, I just probably can't fit them with much padding is all. If you're happy to take the risk with letter mail I am more than happy to! It was more the bigger style jars for blushes or finishing powders, LE brow pomades or lip products (liquid in particular) etc letter mail is a really bad idea and I don't want to take on the risk of the bigger items being broken or exploding in transit!"

You can kind of see how full they are in the pictures and I've noted the ones that have more substantial dents.  (Side note: my brain just shorts out whenever it comes to taking photos, I cannot take a good photo to save my life despite having read so many guides. These are all weirdly coloured and angled, happy to swatch/retake photos, or else you can try googling for swatches if the white balance is out of whack and you want to know what it really looks like)  Sayuri Nail Lacquer (1, 2):  All probably used up to 5 times? $4 each.   #143,  Candied Visions, Mizuiro,  Clouded Skies,  Crystalline.

Either comment or pm or whatever and let me know if you want anything. Feel free to make any reasonable offer too, if you're getting a bunch and want to round down to a whole number, if you're broke but dying for one in particular, if it's your birthday, anything. These are all ones I'm happy to/seeking to get rid of, I've made my peace with not having them anymore. Will post lipsticks (will only be up to 10-15 maybe) and non-indie polishes when I get the courage to go through them - mainstream polishes will either be like a dollar or for giveaway."

Threw everything in one folder this time  Shiro Cosmetics Intertubes: all just swatched, then wiped off the top layer + sanitised with isopropyl alcohol. Their twisting mechanism is a bit dodgy so I had to kind of push them back in with a paper towel. Cost: I don't really care haha, a dollar each? If you really want to?   Three Wolf Moon Team Buffy Why Not Zoidberg? Leeroy Jenkins Sad Keanu   Bobbi Brown:   Long-wear Cream Shadow in Beach Honey. Used a few times, realised I really can't be bothered with eye shadow, scraped the top layer off and sanitised with isopropyl alcohol. I probably paid the Mecca price for it but carved out a bit trying to sanitise it - maybe $15?   Missha:   Sheer Fluid Blusher. Shade No 2, Morning Rose (apparently). $5? Or whatever offer you want to make.   Models Own: all probably worn twice. Wiped off top later, sanitised with isopropyl alcohol. Maybe $5 each?   Ravishing Red (I think, it isn't actually printed on the body of the lipstick) Purple Pleasure Raspberry Cool   3CE: worn once, wiped top layer, sanitised with isopropyl alcohol. $8?   Bella.   Again, for all of these, I'm happy just to be rid of them and have someone who'll appreciate them take them off my hands. Feel free to make me an offer.

AustralianMakeup,30ytkb,bam-bino-69,8,Tue Mar 31 20:23:07 2015 UTC,"Indie cosmetics is basically makeup not made by mass market brands. They're almost always online and some do their local fairs and things to help raise awareness. Most of the products come loose aka loose shadows, blushes, etc. They all offer sample baggies in some capacity and are very affordable when you want to try before you buy! Same deal with perfume oils - there are thousands of scents to try!  All cosmetics are made by hand and of course, being a business, they have to adhere to the cosmetic laws in their country.  To me - Makeup Geek and Color Pop and Lime Crime don't fall under indies because they're mass made. Indie brands, you're often talking directly to the owner to work out any kinks you might have in your order - because they not only make the product, but package it, drop it off at the post office, and do all the admin stuff that comes with running a small business.  Here's a list of well-known indie companies (and that I've had personal experience with)   Shiro Cosmetics  - Game of Thrones themed eyeshadows, Sherlock-themed contour powders, Backstreet Boys and NSYNC lip glosses etc. Shipping times are around 3-4 weeks to arrive from day of purchase. Femme Fatale Cosmetics  - specialises in nail polish across a ton of different indie brands, but has her own brand eyeshadows, blush and finishing powders that are THE BEST. Best duochrome eyeshadows IMHO. Also, Adventure Time eyeshadow collection? She's based in Queensland (one of us, one of us!), so hooray for local shipping! She also stocks Shiro and Hello Waffle. Hello Waffle - really adorable Canadian company. She sells a matte Archer-themed and Frozen-themed eyeshadow collection, lipbalms, liquid lipsticks, finishing powders, blushes - the works. Beautiful packaging, great service!  Fyrinnae - first things first, their website goes down randomly every so often. There's no way to predict it, you might be halfway through checking out and boom, store is closed. Just keep trying, because their products are among the best. Run by a group of dudes whose eyeshadow formula are clearly from some wizardry school. Hands down the BEST eyeshadow formula I've ever used. Their liquid lipsticks are also amazing and they have the indie essential, Pixie Epoxy, which is a glitter glue to help your shadows shine. Don't be put off by shipping either - I've had packages from them arrive within 2 weeks of ordering. Blackbird Cosmetics -  specialises in mattes! Recently came out with pressed shadow singles. Beautiful formula. Also great finishing powders.   Edit - here's a beginners guide wiki that might be useful. You'll find a lot of great info too in the sidebar of /r/indiemakeupandmore"

AustralianMakeup,30ytkb,BBQsauceBel,1 point,Wed Apr 1 02:25:18 2015 UTC,Omg I know! Their Arcane Magic collection is insane - I have a mini in Elegant Revelry and can't stop looking it at when I have it on.  Totally agreed on the minis - they do last forever! Really makes you realise how long eyeshadows take to use up.

AustralianMakeup,30wvl6,ailee612,3,Tue Mar 31 22:04:18 2015 UTC,"My favourite in terms of colour only, not formula, is very very cliche but it's MAC's Ruby Woo. I can't get over how perfect the colour is even though the formula is the most drying, pain in the a** to apply formula I've ever used.   In terms of a more wearable red, I like NYX's Semi Matte Lip Cream in Amsterdam for a matte, and Kate by Rimmel in number 10 for a glossier finish."
AustralianMakeup,30wvl6,jamballdonut,2,Tue Mar 31 13:21:43 2015 UTC,"I've never tried a MAC Retromatte, so not sure how they compare, but Australis ""Diva"" is the same shade as Ruby Woo, and may be a nicer formula? I have it, and it's pretty drying, but again, no idea how it compares to the MAC one :)"

I also have velourlips Nycee, but I haven't used it yet. It looked pretty when I swatched it in Pricelijne, though! I don't wear a lot of red at the moment, since it clashes with my hair, so all my other reds have fallen by the wayside lately."

AustralianMakeup,30wtbb,Tonkie,1 point,Tue Mar 31 10:18:59 2015 UTC,ilia lipsticks aren't worth the price tag tbh. I found them to be quite streaky in their sheerness & not as emollient as i'd usually go for in a non-matte lipstick

AustralianMakeup,30wtbb,TheyreMineralsMarie1,1 point,Wed Apr 1 20:46:02 2015 UTC,"I have one of the Smashbox Blush Rush blushes in the shade Passion and I LOVE it! I find that it blends easily and the colour is not overwhelming in my pale skin (NW13), it's my go-to everyday blush. The powder is very finely milled and it doesn't seem to kick up much fallout around the pan no matter which brush I use (RT contour brush, RT blush brush, Stila brush 24). I definitely reach for it more than either of my two Nars blushes (Orgasm and Amour)."

AustralianMakeup,30wtbb,Mynameisnotsofia,1 point,Wed Apr 1 21:16:52 2015 UTC,I have this Smashbox blush in Flush.  I have NW10 skin so I like it but it would be too light on anything much darker than my own skin.  It's very shimmery but considering how pale it is I find the colour payoff to be reasonably good.  I have had some of their eyeshadows in the past and have found them to be pretty good too.
AustralianMakeup,30uob1,Syrens,18,Mon Mar 30 21:21:46 2015 UTC,like a makeup highlighter or office supplies?
AustralianMakeup,30uob1,neodeone,19,Mon Mar 30 22:32:27 2015 UTC,It's an office supply highlighter. Yep.
AustralianMakeup,30uob1,kittenishgirl,6,Mon Mar 30 22:54:32 2015 UTC,"god, that is so strange!"
AustralianMakeup,30uob1,neodeone,3,Tue Mar 31 00:28:11 2015 UTC,WTF!
AustralianMakeup,30uob1,BBQsauceBel,11,Tue Mar 31 04:31:49 2015 UTC,"I think it was included for one of the other cards included about some highlighter competition, where you write what you like best about yourself and you win... something? Why bellabox partnered with a stationary company I will never understand. I cancelled my sub as soon as I finished opening the box lol."
AustralianMakeup,30uob1,kittenishgirl,5,Mon Mar 30 22:55:46 2015 UTC,"I was hoping it was a range Stabilo did with a cosmetics company and brought out neon lip products in highlighter tubes (that would be cool) however I would rather a highlighter than face wipes and wasn't that disappointed. My partner snapped it up straight away for his desk.   The best thing I got was the Kerastase sachet of a product I am wanting to buy anyway. Good on you Bella Box, the best thing I've had in the last 12 months came out of a sachet.   I am proud to say I just unsubscribed and I feel amazing after giving them my short but glowing review of their service."
AustralianMakeup,30uob1,missbo,4,Tue Mar 31 05:19:39 2015 UTC,"I unsubbed about 3 months ago when I received 2 sample sachets and a deluxe clean and clear sample.  They also- a month prior- delivered it to my home address and not my PO box, which meant my box was sitting on top of my letterbox in the summer sun. I complained and they resent a product that had melted, but sent it wrapped in a handwritten sticky note, to my home address again.   It's not that paying $15 was a waste, it was because I wasn't getting anything out of the boxes that I couldn't purchase at Coles.   I decided to spend a little extra and go with Violetbox, although it feels like I wait forever to get the box, it's nice when it arrives and everything is either full size or deluxe sample. Mostly high end stuff too. It's a shame there's like 2 choices with subscription services in Aust."
AustralianMakeup,30uob1,lush1984,3,Tue Mar 31 08:12:43 2015 UTC,Haha. Not sure if you read my past whinging about my issues with them but when they sent me two replacements it was wrapped like that like there was marajuana inside and a lousy hand written note. Really unprofessional how they package replacements and write you a note with a thousand layers of sticky tape keeping it together. Because I really want it to be a hard task to spend 5 hours opening something that will be shit in the end!
AustralianMakeup,30uob1,missbo,5,Tue Mar 31 08:54:03 2015 UTC,"Oh wow! It wasn't just me! Seriously, not hard to chuck it in an envelope with a bit of bubble wrap maybe!?! The kicker was that we confirmed with each other that my shipping address was still the PO box and it was an error with their mail merge/labelling and the hand written replacement still got sent to my home address."
AustralianMakeup,30uob1,lush1984,2,Tue Mar 31 09:03:48 2015 UTC,"I much prefer violet box too but they also have some odd partnerships, like place a bet with sportsbet to get a beauty box. They should all just stick to beauty."

AustralianMakeup,30scj5,Jessijames,2,Mon Mar 30 19:22:55 2015 UTC,The sheer shades are actually quite pigmented. Nothing like you expect from a sheer lipstick. I bought lady flower yesterday since I love the mini in the stash set I bought.
AustralianMakeup,30scj5,WarlockPanda,3,Mon Mar 30 20:55:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have read that they're not too bad with pigmentation - sheer lipstick is still not really my thang which is why I am disappointed I can't get the originals. Beauty Bay it is!"
AustralianMakeup,30scj5,Jessijames,2,Mon Mar 30 21:40:18 2015 UTC,Any chance for a comparative swatch Panda?
AustralianMakeup,30scj5,Tonkie,1 point,Tue Mar 31 06:55:17 2015 UTC,Sure. I'll have to do it tomorrow since it is so dark now. Would you like lip swatches or arm swatches?
AustralianMakeup,30scj5,WarlockPanda,1 point,Tue Mar 31 07:54:33 2015 UTC,Awesome! I'd love both if it's not too much to ask!
AustralianMakeup,30scj5,Tonkie,1 point,Tue Mar 31 08:01:50 2015 UTC,"Here are the swatches. I think the colours are exactly the same, just a difference in opacity. I do like both, but I will always prefer the original formula because I like my lipstick to be opaque."
AustralianMakeup,30scj5,WarlockPanda,1 point,Wed Apr 1 05:24:55 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! These are great. I am tempted by the sheer, but like you I prefer opaque so might pass...thanks for saving me $$$"
AustralianMakeup,30scj5,Tonkie,1 point,Wed Apr 1 11:07:25 2015 UTC,I have seven of the normal revolution lipsticks and love them. A girl at mecca told me they were discontinuing them which is why they weren't stocking them in Mecca but tbh I don't believe that at all. The sheer ones are still very pigmented but definitely more glossy.
AustralianMakeup,30scj5,Jessijames,1 point,Mon Mar 30 21:58:05 2015 UTC,"No way! I can't imagine a reason why they'd ever discontinue them, they're fantastic! Close to, if not my top favourite lipstick formula. If so I will have to stock up like mad."
AustralianMakeup,30scj5,WarlockPanda,1 point,Mon Mar 30 22:11:12 2015 UTC,Yeah it sounded pretty silly to me and I can't find anything to indicate that online. I wouldn't freak out yet.
AustralianMakeup,30scj5,Jessijames,1 point,Mon Mar 30 23:25:49 2015 UTC,I'm thinking of ordering some when the new tarte showstopper palette comes out if you would like to piggy back on shipping.

AustralianMakeup,30scj5,Jessijames,1 point,Tue Mar 31 09:38:24 2015 UTC,I'm undecided as to when. The palette comes out on tartes website soon. Ulta on the 11th and Sephora on the 17th. If the tarte website has a good deal I'll get it from there. I plan on getting someone from MUE to forward me everything.   EDIT: looks like it is at ulta now so I might organise my order soonish. I looked up some swatches and I'm in love with the palette

If only I could put the blush from the rainforest palette into showstopped! I feel like I can dupe the shadows in the palette from my own collection too :/  I am pretty sure the Metallic liquifieds are already up on the TF website, if you're buying a couple you should qualify for free shipping anyway! :)  EDIT: Panda, check this out...https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupAddiction/comments/30f5f3/tarte_showstopper_palette/cps3wvt"

Always great service (eg. let me know when she was running late). I only gave it up because I bought a house and had to forgo some of my discretionary spending. I was paying about $80ish for a natural set of mink lashes. I got heaps of compliments about them and didn't have to wear mascara all the time.
AustralianMakeup,30sbv5,purethrill,2,Mon Mar 30 09:00:09 2015 UTC,That's actually really good. At my work a few weeks ago a lady came in saying she paid $150 for her lash extensions for her wedding that weekend. I thought that was crazy expensive!!

I also only had one thing out of stock, the Models Prefer Party Glam palette. because that put my purchase down to under $100 i was worried i was gonna be slugged for shipping but they still gave me free shipping, i was super impressed :)"
AustralianMakeup,30rhri,amyeh,2,Mon Mar 30 03:16:37 2015 UTC,"That's so cool of them! I tried to be as close as possible to $100 without going under, but I gave up and figured I hadn't bought anything since the last 40% so hopefully now I won't have to buy anything until the next one.   My out of stock item was the Models Prefer soft touch powder in Luminous Glow. Not super devastated because I wasn't 100% sold on it but I'm in love with the other three so now I want to try it out."
AustralianMakeup,30rhri,disorderedmind,2,Mon Mar 30 03:20:12 2015 UTC,"They had tons of that shade at Macquarie centre, but none in Soft Focus which is the one I wanted"
AustralianMakeup,30rhri,LaTableElitaire,2,Wed Apr 1 09:17:28 2015 UTC,"Mine got shipped today, one item was no longer available and refunded. I ordered the last night of sale so I guess they don't ship in order."

AustralianMakeup,30rhri,bam-bino-69,2,Mon Mar 30 12:46:10 2015 UTC,"I took a loose interpretation to ASAP, uni and all.   Everything I ordered online, and everything I picked up in-store afterwards. Grimy fingerprints and all."
AustralianMakeup,30rhri,bam-bino-69,3,Tue Mar 31 04:53:03 2015 UTC,"Jealous. Mine hasn't even shipped yet, it still says processing :( I ordered Tuesday morning so I was hoping to have it by this Tuesday at the latest but it looks like I'll be waiting a little longer!"
AustralianMakeup,30ojca,gospursgo_,9,Sun Mar 29 07:18:27 2015 UTC,"So, i picked up these liquid lipsticks up from ebay, where they're listed as glosses...theyre NOT glosses, theyre wayyyy better than that.   The five that i have are so pigmented, except #9, its pigmented but not as much as the others. my swatches may not be the most true to colour, this one is pretty good for reference though: http://i01.i.aliimg.com/img/pb/112/424/127/1127424112_394.jpg,  33 is apparently a dupe for limecrime's wicked. and number 25 is suchhhh a beautiful hot pink, reminds me of the bright pink bourjois velvet. just google 'menow swatches' and you'll get an idea.  edit: this girl also has great swatches http://juliasallure.com/2014/05/20/m-n-me-now-generation-ii-long-lasting-lip-gloss-swatch-review/  The longevity of these is great, as with any other liquid lippy, they will come off with greasy food, but they wear off nicely imo, wont smudge around my mouth or go chunky. I have just reapplied on top of what was already on my lips by gently dabbing and its sitting nicely! the doe foot applicator has the perfect amount on it to coat your lips when you pull it out of the tube. seriously, the application is soooooooo easy, i struggle with velourlips SO MUCh.  the texture is not a mousse like velourlips, its just a creamy consistency...similar to kat von d Everlasting i'd say. or the rimmel provocalips. Its not drying, in the lip swatch, my lips are already SOOOOO dry (like even pure shea butter is struggling to help with this sahara sitaution) but they havent accentuated that or make them feel uncomfortable. They set generally quickly, but it depends how thick the coats you apply are, two thin coats works best, i dont wear balm under because for me it defeats the purpose of long wearing matte lips.  now the best part...these only cost me $1 each. im not sure how that works...because honestly these are my favourite thing in life right now. the price is NOT a factor in my review for these, i would happily pay $25 for these, its lasted longer than my kat von d version, and its easier to wear than velourlips, there's no weird smell, and i believe they are FDA approved.  i just bought some more from /u/LemonCake_ - im not sure if she liked them or not, but this is just my review :)  edit: i got them from this seller http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/321636668443?_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649&var=510530403114&ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT  and this seller http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/321469368875?_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649&var=510361939903&ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT  edit number 900: im wearing 33 atm and i LOVE IT, its so dark and beautiful. it wasnt patchy AT ALL like these dark colours can be.  and one more edit because i can: uploaded swatches comparing to a couple of the new velour lips :)"
AustralianMakeup,30ojca,Flippantry,3,Sun Mar 29 07:18:35 2015 UTC,"No weird smell   Sign me up!  I feel like lately, every matte lip product I buy has a really funky smell to them and it's super bogus and unappealing.   Thanks for the review, I've been seeing these around a bit and I think they've been playing with the formula as the swatches I've seen on aliexpress have never looked this good (as good as the one you've linked above)   Edit: here's another picture I've found which shows the swatches in slightly different light/intensity if anyone is curious.  18 looks a bit like the Cashmere velveteen, I love the look of 22 as well!"
AustralianMakeup,30ojca,Flippantry,3,Sun Mar 29 08:32:26 2015 UTC,"Flippantry, i think you'd absolutely love these. the first thing i did was smell them- after being traumatized by the savvy one, i was ecstatic to find these passed the smell test. the swatches on aliexpress are dodgy and blurry and photoshopped to hell and back lol, wish i could take proper swatches, but a proper google will give you some good results. lmk which shades you end up going for, i need to go back for 01, 16, and 28!"
AustralianMakeup,30ojca,Flippantry,1 point,Sun Mar 29 08:37:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think I might finally take the plunge and I mean at $1.23 each, even if they turn out horribly it's hardly a big loss, I'm gonna do it!  I'm going to get that cashmere looking one and join the cashmere-circlejerk! :D"
AustralianMakeup,30ojca,Lunawinter,1 point,Sun Mar 29 08:47:24 2015 UTC,"exactly, at that price to try, its a steal esp if its a close dupe such as this: (number 18) http://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xfa1/t51.2885-15/s306x306/e15/10932053_1553129818259100_366306205_n.jpg  if youre impatient with overseas post, /u/Lemoncake_ has it up in her sale with another two :)"

AustralianMakeup,30ojca,bam-bino-69,2,Mon Mar 30 01:50:22 2015 UTC,"I have Doobai, i will compare when i get home from work and try to take pictures, but 22 leans more...plummy so its like a darker Shang-hai. while 33 is more similar to the dark red provocalips.  but i like them more than the velourlips in terms of texture"
AustralianMakeup,30ojca,LetThemEatDick,1 point,Mon Mar 30 02:06:13 2015 UTC,"Darker than Shanghai sounds perfect actually, i skipped picking that up because i thought it might be a bit bright for me.

AustralianMakeup,30ojca,Syrens,1 point,Mon Mar 30 12:28:36 2015 UTC,"Thankyou so much! I ended up ordering 22 and 18, but I think I might get 33 as well because it's a bit different to the provocalips but doesn't look as dark as budapash. I also have 12, 16, and 26 on my list to order if the first ones work out well. It was so tempting just to get all the colours so I could experiment though... I only just started wearing lip colour so I'm still working out what suits me."

AustralianMakeup,30ki38,Flippantry,3,Sat Mar 28 10:04:58 2015 UTC,"Wow, they look amazing on you.  I've been pretty on the fence about these.  I can appreciate where they're coming from but I've not been too interested in most of the shades since there's going to be few occasions where I'll be able to wear them but you've still made sinful look quite lovely and wearable (perhaps you're one of the lucky people who can get away with blue lipstick? :D)   Thanks for posting!  I'm pretty interested in Trickery and Power."
AustralianMakeup,30ki38,ComingUpMilhouse,2,Sat Mar 28 06:06:35 2015 UTC,I have a bunch of these already because I bought a bunch months ago and I'm not crash hot on the formula. I tried wearing the black one last night and it moved a lot.

AustralianMakeup,30kfwy,Haibarai,1 point,Sat Mar 28 13:32:04 2015 UTC,There's a full MAC counter and sometimes they get travel only sets (a little like the Nordstrom anniversary sets).  However all the products are AU rrp less GST so the savings aren't great on any brand unless you're looking at the travel exclusive stuff.
AustralianMakeup,30kfwy,ArrghUrrgh,1 point,Sun Mar 29 22:59:04 2015 UTC,I'd like to read your run down!  It would actually be really useful to know what's worth buying at the various International Airports in Australia and whether to buy on departure or arrival.
AustralianMakeup,30gzbr,pootlepower,1 point,Fri Mar 27 08:02:29 2015 UTC,"I own both. I definitely found the rimmel liner far too dark and orange. However, the nyx one just wont stay in my waterline :( I can't win!"
AustralianMakeup,30gzbr,cherrybun,1 point,Fri Mar 27 22:25:46 2015 UTC,I found the NYX great for touching up around my lipline if I'm wearing a bright colour and throughout the day I smudge it or it bleeds over. It helps disguise that stain from the lipcolour!
AustralianMakeup,30gzbr,Jessijames,1 point,Fri Mar 27 23:31:14 2015 UTC,"I have both as well, and actually found that the Scandaleyes is too creamy and when I use it on my bottom waterline it smudges into my bottom lashes!

AustralianMakeup,30gzbr,ailee612,1 point,Mon Mar 30 11:06:22 2015 UTC,"Actually, you're right. I did learn on the first application that the Rimmel needs a light hand or that shit goes everywhere, should have put that in the original review. It has so much more staying power than the NYX, though!"

AustralianMakeup,30gxtx,BlueRainstorm,3,Fri Mar 27 07:38:23 2015 UTC,"Yes they will! They will also happily give samples if you want to try it out at home first too. Just letting you know though, almost all nars foundation colours are out of stock nationwide at the moment, but there are so many other, and in my opinion, better foundations at Mecca! Trust me, I work there."
AustralianMakeup,30gxtx,musclefever,1 point,Fri Mar 27 07:50:53 2015 UTC,Can I ask what better foundations you're referring to?  Also do I need to come into the store without makeup? Because I'm pretty embarrassed to go out in my naked face (yay hormonal acne) and feel like the gorgeous makeup people at Mecca will judge me and not wanna help me.
AustralianMakeup,30gxtx,xanaboobs,5,Fri Mar 27 08:21:39 2015 UTC,"Lady lady! Don't feel that way. Whenever you're worrying about people judging you negatively, just remember how little you really think about other people. Even if you notice something, I doubt you spend much time thinking about it, and I doubt you think any less of someone for it.  The Mecca ladies might look flawless but they have makeup skills and staff discounts, and they're doing their job. If they even raise an eyebrow at you, you should punch em in the nose and feel good about it, because they'd have to be really shitty people.  I'm ranting, but, you're fab."
AustralianMakeup,30gxtx,musclefever,3,Fri Mar 27 08:42:25 2015 UTC,"Sure! Depending on what kind of finish you are after, I can recommend a few, but obviously different things work better for different people. If you are going to a Mecca Maxima, and want something similar to Sheer Glow, I would recommend Bobbi Brown Skin Foundation or Urban Decay Naked Skin - both are a natural skin finish. If you are heading to a Mecca Cosmetica, check out Ellis Faas or Chantacaille Future Skin (that one is pricey but amazing!) Maybe have a look at Stila Stay All Day as well. You can wear make up to the store, we are happy to whip it off for you and will make sure you leave looking good - no stress! Maxima stores are a little more laid back, so maybe try there if you have one near you. We won't judge you, we are there to help you out and make you feel great! Don't be afraid to ask for samples first, you are more than welcome to take them! Hope that helps."

Also from far away everything is minimised, it's only when you examine yourself up close does it look like the end of the world. To the rest of the world, I'm sure you look like just a normal human being :)  Honestly though I've been to 3 Meccas and every time all the girls there are really friendly and don't seem judgmental at all.

AustralianMakeup,30gxtx,Joolebear,3,Fri Mar 27 14:24:48 2015 UTC,"It definitely depends on the Mecca. I'm not sure where you're based, but the Mecca girls in Sydney vary for me personally - I love Galeries and Myer Pitt St girls.  When you go get your foundation matched, definitely make sure they listen to you and ask questions. Questions you need to ask yourself and when you're at Mecca:   figure out your skin type (not just skintone) you are do you touch your face a lot are you looking for light-medium coverage or heavier? liquid or powder preference? does a foundation perform better with fingers or a brush application - how do you prefer to apply foundation? do you like a dewy or matte look?  preference for silicon or water-based foundations? If you don't know the difference - ask! have any foundations ever been returned? E.g. some foundation lines might have a higher rate of people returning them for whatever reason. also check reviews of brands you're interested in, both on Mecca & makeupalley if you have time   Definitely ask for samples of a range of brands if you can - make sure each sample is enough to get you through at least 2-3 days of use.  I personally worship at the church of NARS Sheer Glow (their matte version is no bueno for me), because it's yellow enough for my olive tones, but also plays well with my dry patches and eczema.  Good luck! :))"
AustralianMakeup,30gxtx,DarkPhoenix1993,1 point,Fri Mar 27 08:33:52 2015 UTC,Are you me!? I have eczema and dry patches. Hence why I was actually looking at NARS Sheer Glow. I did a bunch of research on the foundations and came to that one. I'm located in Brisbane. Do I have to pay for the samples at all? (have never shopped there).
AustralianMakeup,30gxtx,rebcart,3,Fri Mar 27 08:37:55 2015 UTC,"i have crazy eczema and i LOVE the cream compact. i've raved about it on /r/mua so much.  heres a copy paste from another comment i made. sheer glow doesnt work for my dry skin and is recommended for more combo skin  also heres a link that can help you with choosing a store http://www.reddit.com/r/AustralianMakeup/comments/2kj6tp/we_need_you_the_mecca_masterlist/    My favourite foundations are the Bourjois Healthy Mix Serum (focus on the serum because the normal one doesnt work as well on dry skin IMO) for a cheaper foundation.

AustralianMakeup,30fa24,RipperReeta,2,Thu Mar 26 22:36:43 2015 UTC,Just ordered Naked 2!
AustralianMakeup,30fa24,_cephei,2,Fri Mar 27 00:07:06 2015 UTC,Everything is showing in stock for me.  It may be the system. Often they (smaller online stores) can only load 80 or so in to the 'IN STOCK' area and as they sell out they have to update more in to the system. It's often built in that way but also a good way to ensure you don't sell things that are sold out.
AustralianMakeup,30fa24,Joolebear,2,Fri Mar 27 00:31:59 2015 UTC,51 items showing for me now... trying to decide what I want. I have a $50 voucher for there but I am not really wearing much makeup anymore - thinking maybe one of the sheer lipsticks or the beauty balm
AustralianMakeup,30fa24,fuzzboo,2,Fri Mar 27 02:07:42 2015 UTC,I saw all the products available om their website this morning at 7.40am aest. Hope you guys got what you wanted!

AustralianMakeup,30fa24,WarlockPanda,1 point,Fri Mar 27 07:21:48 2015 UTC,I went in store and could only find the sheer revolution lipsticks and not the regular line.

They were the only thing I was interested in buying. Hopefully they will stock it otherwise I will just have to settle for the Sheer version of Ladyflower."
AustralianMakeup,30fa24,WarlockPanda,1 point,Fri Mar 27 22:30:45 2015 UTC,So apparently UD have discontinued the Revolution lipsticks ;-; Well at least I don't have to worry about spending money anymore...

Natio primer, Maybelline Fit Me liquid + powder (both 225) + concealer (medium), MP cream blush + NYX blush (Peach), Stila Stay All Day eyeliner, Maybelline Full n Stuff + Bourjois volume mascara, and Provocalips Make Your Move! Pretty basic stuff - my eczema tends to flare up around my eyes from constant eyeshadow, so I keep it for special occasions."
AustralianMakeup,30dc33,kellyyyllek,2,Thu Mar 26 13:33:47 2015 UTC,"Looks great! A little bit of CC though: I agree with /u/kellyyyllek about extending out your eyeliner. Also I think maybe you should blend out the inner half of your eyebrows a bit more to make it look a bit more natural. A flesh toned liner on your waterline would help to counteract the darkness around your eyes. Are you able to wear other products as eyeshadow or will everything irritate? I sometimes throw on a little bit of concealer, highlighter or even brow powder instead of shadow when I'm lazy or caught without."
AustralianMakeup,30ctzt,deadlypony,5,Thu Mar 26 09:31:49 2015 UTC,"heya, even if it has broken some people out, it might not break you out as we all have different skin, you wont know till you try. furthermore, it may not be the water breaking people out, but rather not completely removing all the make up. at least its half price now so worth a try, and its life changing if it does work for you :)"
AustralianMakeup,30ctzt,gospursgo_,1 point,Thu Mar 26 09:35:52 2015 UTC,"It makes more sense to get the Garnier one since its double the size of the L'Oreal bottle and they're both the same price! I think will probably get it and try it out, thanks xx"
AustralianMakeup,30ctzt,AurelieBastienne,1 point,Thu Mar 26 09:38:40 2015 UTC,"If you are keen on good price, chemist warehouse has 500ml byphasse micellaire water for cheaper. Of course, do your research, but I haven't had any issues with it!  Edit: just checked the site and it's $4.99 for the 500ml. Some reviews note it as a good dupe for the bioderma."
AustralianMakeup,30ctzt,firsttimemidwife,2,Thu Mar 26 10:00:17 2015 UTC,"That stuff is the shiz! I honestly prefer it to Bioderma, and not just because of the price. It takes off way more make up with much less fuss and residue."

AustralianMakeup,30ctzt,jamballdonut,3,Thu Mar 26 23:45:14 2015 UTC,"I really like the Garnier Micellar water! I've been using it for almost a year now and it hasn't broken me out, but I have pretty dry skin majority of the year so that could be why. I will also say that it's not the best for removing eye makeup, and if you use too much it can sting your eyes."
AustralianMakeup,30ctzt,Jessijames,1 point,Thu Mar 26 10:29:17 2015 UTC,"The only Micellar water I've tired is the L'Oreal one and it didn't sting my eyes, but I am keen to try the Garnier one and compare!"
AustralianMakeup,30ctzt,amyeh,3,Thu Mar 26 23:48:53 2015 UTC,"I found that it broke me out too, but ONLY when I was using it 3 times a day, since it was overcleaning my skin and stripping back too many of my natural oils.  Now, I only use it once in the morning, and my skin has improved sooooo much.  I barely get breakouts anymore! I think there's no harm in trying, it's a nifty product!"
AustralianMakeup,30ctzt,Unlumpyspaceprincess,2,Thu Mar 26 10:58:36 2015 UTC,"Yes! I only use it in the morning, I find it a great product to remove the 'overnight grime' haha"
AustralianMakeup,30ctzt,BBQsauceBel,1 point,Fri Mar 27 00:40:48 2015 UTC,I think I'll be fine if I use it once a day then :) thanks so much
AustralianMakeup,30ctzt,KindOfOldNewGirl,3,Thu Mar 26 23:46:47 2015 UTC,"I use it about once a day, and it's fine. As another poster said, it really cleans up oil, so if people are breaking out, they are probably using it way too much. I use it after OCM to make sure I get that last little bit of oil cleaned up, and then I moisturise like crazy. My skin has never been happier."
AustralianMakeup,30ctzt,sailorgloom,2,Thu Mar 26 21:51:53 2015 UTC,Suggestion - why not try the simple micellar water? I used the garnier one and then decided to try this one after running out. I prefer simple's micellar water as I feel it doesn't leave a soapy residue on my face.
AustralianMakeup,30ctzt,szarkasm,1 point,Thu Mar 26 10:21:35 2015 UTC,"Not sure if that one is available in NZ, I'll deffs have a look for it though! Thanks :)"
AustralianMakeup,30ctzt,sailorgloom,1 point,Thu Mar 26 23:50:07 2015 UTC,Ooh thanks. The residue was the one thing I disliked about Garnier's.
AustralianMakeup,30ctzt,szarkasm,2,Tue Mar 31 04:51:39 2015 UTC,I like my swisse one. It was half price at woolworths last week.
AustralianMakeup,30ctzt,spitey,2,Thu Mar 26 11:48:26 2015 UTC,I'm an artist and I use it in my kit. The only reason it would be causing breakouts is if the person is oily/sensitive and they didn't use the cleanser properly.
AustralianMakeup,30ctzt,crossesafimelb,1 point,Thu Mar 26 12:16:36 2015 UTC,What do you mean by not using the cleanser properly? I've got oily skin and maybe I'm doing it wrong?

AustralianMakeup,30coqr,SizzlingVivacity,5,Thu Mar 26 08:19:01 2015 UTC,Best thing I've read All day
AustralianMakeup,30coqr,jamballdonut,11,Thu Mar 26 08:34:58 2015 UTC,"I like to go about my velourlips this way:  Exfoliate and apply a large amount of a very moisturising lip balm (I use Nivea Milk and Honey). Wait a few minutes and then wipe the lip balm off, leaving just the tiniest film behind. Apply one incredibly thin layer of Velourlips. I wipe almost all product off the applicator. Once this layer is tacky (not wet or dry), put on a second equally thin layer. When i do it this way, its never flaky or sticky and I own 9 of them.  Another option is to check the bottom of the tube to see if the formula is split. That happened to me with Mal-I-Boo."
AustralianMakeup,30coqr,ihaveacat-,3,Thu Mar 26 08:45:06 2015 UTC,"I'm seconding this application process! The first time I used one of mine, I did a super thick layer, and it never actually dried and was just horrible to work with.  I now do thin layers and they're fabulous to work with!"
AustralianMakeup,30coqr,LordeBaldemort,1 point,Thu Mar 26 09:02:26 2015 UTC,Thank you for the advice! I'll have to try it that way next time.
AustralianMakeup,30coqr,Jessijames,5,Thu Mar 26 09:08:59 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm really not impressed with it. It goes all patchy and reapplying doesn't help as it turns into this cakey mess
AustralianMakeup,30coqr,sarkata,4,Thu Mar 26 11:14:14 2015 UTC,I was just about to post the same complaint! Doo-bai seems ok though.
AustralianMakeup,30coqr,gospursgo_,9,Thu Mar 26 09:20:10 2015 UTC,This is after 90 minutes and a bottle of water:   http://imgur.com/r2wzyDP  I exfoliated. I prepped with lip balm. What the actual hell.
AustralianMakeup,30coqr,KindOfOldNewGirl,1 point,Thu Mar 26 09:08:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, don't leave the lip balm on your lips prior to application. In my experience it prevents the product from setting properly and results like this for me every time if I don't wipe off balm first."
AustralianMakeup,30coqr,smilingsunbeams,3,Thu Mar 26 23:37:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have way more issues with Buda-pash than Doobai, which is a very similar colour on the lips."
AustralianMakeup,30coqr,firsttimemidwife,2,Thu Mar 26 11:03:55 2015 UTC,"not to hijack your thread- but guys, has the formula changed on these newer releases? doesnt seem to be as budge-proof"
AustralianMakeup,30coqr,Jessijames,2,Thu Mar 26 09:16:34 2015 UTC,Try hyaluronic acid lip balm from daiso. Blot your lips then apply thin layers of velourlips.
AustralianMakeup,30coqr,LMTartistry,1 point,Thu Mar 26 11:55:22 2015 UTC,Personally I haven't had this issue but if you try a thin layer of balm underneath it may help?
AustralianMakeup,30coqr,smilingsunbeams,2,Thu Mar 26 08:22:46 2015 UTC,"I've found that the velour lips tend to move if you use balms underneath. Unfortunatly I found the same thing with Buda-Pash, very patchy and fades unevenly if you apply it to full intensity. Ny-cee however is amazing, so I'm a bit disappointed."

I haven't tried the Australis one but I've rarely been wow'd by a lot of Australis products so even if I hadn't read this, I probably wouldn't pick this up.  I have tried a few different ""pore minimising"" products and did a comparison here if you're interested.  None of the best performers were quite as cheap but I felt Garnier's Miracle Blur and The Face Shop's Pore Balm worked quite well in comparison (both sit around the $16.95-ish mark)"

AustralianMakeup,3088sp,Teacupbunny,2,Wed Mar 25 12:25:54 2015 UTC,I'm with you on the Miracle Blur - this is the closest thing I have been able to find. I actually mix it with the Porefessional to help it stretch a bit further.
AustralianMakeup,3088sp,jamballdonut,3,Wed Mar 25 09:32:18 2015 UTC,"The Australis one is $16.95 RRP :)  Hint send too early, darn it.  But, good review! I picked up the Australis one to compare to my Porefessional too, so I'll check the 2 of mine against each other to see if mine are the same!"

AustralianMakeup,3088sp,smilingsunbeams,1 point,Thu Mar 26 04:40:45 2015 UTC,This has definitely pushed me to getting it now!
AustralianMakeup,3088sp,tofu-queen,2,Thu Mar 26 09:10:33 2015 UTC,Seems like I'm in the minority here! I actually bought a bottle before the sale because I tested it in store and found it extremely similar to my Porefessional sample. I've only used it once and honestly couldn't find a difference. Maybe my Porefessional is bad if everyone else has had such bad experiences with the Australis?

AustralianMakeup,307ssz,RipperReeta,1 point,Wed Mar 25 10:30:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's totally different to toner."
AustralianMakeup,307ssz,spitey,1 point,Thu Mar 26 01:43:56 2015 UTC,"Naa - Its a cleanser. It's because of the surfactants in the water which essentially make it soapy water that doesn't separate like it usually would because of it's molecular structure - It's also very sensitive and not harsh like usual soaps. On top of that, it interacts with the cotton pad and the micelle and the cotton work together to take the make up off.   The science of it is pretty cool actually - You should check it out! :)"
AustralianMakeup,307j4z,rebcart,3,Wed Mar 25 02:25:53 2015 UTC,I have a few unused/unopened bottles of the Covergirl Outlast Stay Fabulous in ivory - you're welcome to grab a couple if you're happy to cover postage :)  These are the leftovers from the last Heat group warehouse sale I went to here in Melbourne...they were selling bottles of this in only the ivory shade for .50 cents each so I grabbed like....a ton haha
AustralianMakeup,307j4z,Jessijames,1 point,Wed Mar 25 03:39:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for the offer! Is Ivory the same as Classic Ivory? Because the latter is the lightest they had at Priceline, and when I swatched it it was quite a bit darker than the Trublend."
AustralianMakeup,307j4z,Jessijames,1 point,Wed Mar 25 09:08:06 2015 UTC,I have heard this is lighter than Classic Ivory - I'm about a NARS Siberia/MAC NW10 and it's pretty spot on!

AustralianMakeup,307j4z,DctrCat,0,Wed Mar 25 12:03:13 2015 UTC,"Oh, I meant if you're going to be in a store anytime in the near future, a comparison swatch against a Trublend tester would be awesome. Sorry for not being clearer."

AustralianMakeup,307j4z,gemawo,1 point,Wed Mar 25 03:30:13 2015 UTC,"This is fantastic, thankyou! What happened with Bobbi Brown? Why would they have a tester out and then not actually sell that shade? How silly!  Also, is the Covergirl trublend the liquid foundation or the powder?"
AustralianMakeup,307j4z,missb00,2,Wed Mar 25 04:32:39 2015 UTC,"That's the thing, that technically Alabaster is never shipped to Australia apparently (it only exists here in their stick foundation, not the liquids). But when I was looking at the array of testers, I noticed this one little jar with Alabaster because I was specifically looking for the shade before being told about the whole stock thing. When the counter lady told me they don't have it, and I pointed it out, she looked flabbergasted and eagerly filled up my whole sample jar with it because, and I quote, ""I'm just going to have to throw this away anyway, it's not like I'll be able to offer it to anyone else"".   Actually, it hadn't been touched for so long that it was super separated and needed heaps of mixing. :P It must have been shipped in a giant box of testers by mistake.  All the foundations in the photos are liquids! I'm a bit wary of powders and they're too hard to take samples of home anyway."
AustralianMakeup,307j4z,missb00,1 point,Wed Mar 25 04:45:16 2015 UTC,Makes sense they might ship their tester bottles in 'sets' - good on her for at least filling up a sample for you though :)

AustralianMakeup,307i3d,The_Sick,3,Wed Mar 25 02:17:29 2015 UTC,"Do you have any pictures from before/after pressing? You may not be pressing the product hard enough back into the pan, so it is drying quite 'loose' and hence re-crumbling."
AustralianMakeup,307i3d,Jessijames,2,Wed Mar 25 03:44:08 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I've repressed a mini Laguna into another palette using just alcohol (sounds like I followed the same method as you) and it hasn't crumbled.  If it's crumbling, you might find some luck adding some glycerine to the combo.  Usually when people press loose shadows, a couple of drops of glycerine will help bind it together better.  You can get glycerine usually at the supermarket or most chemists but I don't think it's very cheap :("
AustralianMakeup,307i3d,Flippantry,1 point,Wed Mar 25 06:09:55 2015 UTC,Agreed! Add a little glycerin. It'll make the pressing a bit messier but it'll stop the crumbling! :)
AustralianMakeup,307i3d,lanadelghey,1 point,Thu Mar 26 07:12:06 2015 UTC,Is it possible that it didn't dry properly after pressing? I know that brand of isopropyl alcohol has a quite high water content (30-40%).

However, I always use primer (Too Faced Shadow Insurance) and I don't have any high end shadows to compare. I mostly have NYX, Fyrinnae and other indies, and I think they compare well although the shimmers are not in the same league as Fyrinnae. My local Target always has Chi Chi testers out, so you can swatch on the back of your hand if that would help you judge the quality. :)"

AustralianMakeup,3049z0,Teacupbunny,3,Wed Mar 25 12:22:42 2015 UTC,i bought two on monday - the nudes and bases and Im not happy with them. I wiped off the one I used and went back with my naked 3.

Personally I wouldn't spend $23 on them each but maybe Im a tad snobby because of the naked hahaha. I tried around some more with them today and they're not too bad. Theres a lot of fallout in the pan when you put your brush in and its a bit more effort than the UD ones. The gold shadow in one of them is lovely though. I'll have a play around again tomorrow. My skin isnt happy with me so I wiped it all off and im about to do a mask =) I'll report tomorrow xx

I included a couple of skincare items as I went, and I have already cracked open my next jar of the Australis Ready Set Go Finishing Powder - This project has made me realize how much I LOVE that stuff haha  I highly recommend embarking on something like this especially if you're someone who 'half uses' up a bunch of different products and then doesn't touch them for months at a time...like me! :)"
AustralianMakeup,30476c,WarlockPanda,2,Tue Mar 24 10:01:28 2015 UTC,Crazy progress. What I love about panning is reflecting on whether you would really repurchase a product. And you obviously did for the Australis powder. I hope it has HG status in your collection!

AustralianMakeup,30476c,alyss0r,3,Tue Mar 24 10:15:53 2015 UTC,I'd have to say the Hourglass! Both the Inglot & L'oreal are super silicone-y primers that were almost greasy to the touch so I didn't enjoy them all that much. I like the Porefessional but it did break me out - I much prefer the SHE Pure Magic primer to the Porefessional. It has a much lighter fluffier whipped texture and sits on my skin much better!  All I did was grab a huge mason jar to keep the empties in on my bathroom counter in plain sight. It kept it in my mind which really helped!

I think it’s a good basic palette, great selection of different colours, although I wouldn't personally use the last two browns as much as I’m planning to use the first eight!    I’m personally bias towards sparkly shadows, so my favourites are 1, 4 and 6. Pigmentation was good for what I thought. All in all I really like this palette seeing as it has some pretty basic colours you can use with other statement shadows or for a natural day/dark smoky eye look!    Edit: One stroke finger swatch, no primer!"
AustralianMakeup,303w4q,criti_biti,3,Tue Mar 24 06:54:47 2015 UTC,I thought I didn't need it. I was wrong. I need it.   Are they just finger swatches? The pigmentation looks awesome for $12 or whatever it is.
AustralianMakeup,303w4q,pootlepower,1 point,Tue Mar 24 07:01:41 2015 UTC,"I definitely recommend it! They were done with a brush, but I just included a finger swatch in my first comment. $7.80 with the current sales!"
AustralianMakeup,303w4q,peanut_23,3,Tue Mar 24 08:00:37 2015 UTC,"This palette is legit. I bought it during the MP 3 for 2 sale to use as a travel/on-the-go palette because it's so tiny, wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly suprised. The shades you've labelled 1 and 4 are my favourites, dat glowy highlight."

AustralianMakeup,303w4q,Flippantry,3,Tue Mar 24 13:32:50 2015 UTC,"I bought this yesterday as part of my priceline haul (40% off sales please come back to me), and I'm thoroughly impressed myself, especially for the price. I bought it primarily as a tester to see if I would use a palette like that in anticipation for a possible purchase of a UD Naked Palette from Mecca (so soon!), but I love this so much I might not need to (oh but I will still want to).  As a sidenote, I'm curious about the Savvy baked blush you've got there also, what's it like in terms of wear?"
AustralianMakeup,303w4q,pondicus,1 point,Thu Mar 26 03:03:02 2015 UTC,"I know! I was going to get the Naked Palette, but as someone who doesn't have a large portion of my pay to put towards makeup, Models Prefer definitely has it together! I'm super super happy with it, and I'm so glad you are too!    With Savvy, I've literally never worn blush before in fear of ridiculous pink cheeks, but decided to try it out after browsing this sub and seeing some really great reviews about all savvy blushes (Some saying it's the best they've ever used/they've bought all blushes in all colours!) And for the price it's hard not to buy to try! I'll try it out this weekend and see how it goes :)"
AustralianMakeup,303w4q,jamballdonut,1 point,Thu Mar 26 04:44:55 2015 UTC,"Might drop in on Priceline just to check it out in person, I live in fear of ridiculously pink blushes too :P"
AustralianMakeup,303w4q,22catch,2,Sat Mar 28 13:31:03 2015 UTC,Oh this looks really nice!  It's good to see more of these brands releasing some nice little palettes.  Are the swatches you did with a primer or just on a bare arm?
AustralianMakeup,303saf,jamballdonut,3,Tue Mar 24 05:59:41 2015 UTC,"(I'm also going to edit this into the post I made of new releases in March, but I figured more people would look at this!)  Saw these in the Priceline in my city, and picked up the brow kit in light (VERY red-toned, which is why I grabbed it), they also had some brow brushes in a kit (Spoolie, angled brush, sponge brush, and something else?), brow highlighter (nude/gold), and the brow gel (also picked that up to try out)"
AustralianMakeup,303saf,Flippantry,1 point,Tue Mar 24 06:01:04 2015 UTC,"Red Toned?! :D  I'd love to hear how they turn out, especially the brow gel actually.  I was strong armed by the sales person at Illamasqua to buy their Brow Gel and whilst it's nice, I'm pretty sure I made a silly mistake with paying so much for something so basic!    I'm glad there's been more of a branch out with brow products these days, fingers crossed we get more shades being introduced too!  (it's darn hard to find a pencil that matches my hair colour!)"
AustralianMakeup,303saf,Flippantry,2,Tue Mar 24 07:00:06 2015 UTC,"I'm planning on doing a full review tomorrow, so I'll take some photos for you then! But, it does appear quite red-toned to me (Although, I'm artificially red, not naturally, so my perception of red-toned may be different than yours!)  I'll let you know how it goes tomorrow! :)"
AustralianMakeup,304a6d,phxebe,7,Tue Mar 24 10:44:15 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, Priceline doesn't stock C1 :( for whatever bizarro reason, Australia gets a superrrr limited shade range in a lot of products, True Match being one of them. I have N1, but I got a friend to pick it up for me in the US and the formula for the True Match we have is totally different to the US one, so I can't offer any dupes. BUT! as a fellow super pale girl, I would highly recommend Revlon Colorstay in Ivory."
AustralianMakeup,304a6d,lemonlemonboom,1 point,Tue Mar 24 10:56:39 2015 UTC,OH NO! I meant to say C2... There is C2 and W1 on the Priceline website that look to be the lightest. I've tried Colorstay and I hate the formula unfortunately. :(
AustralianMakeup,304a6d,lemonlemonboom,2,Tue Mar 24 11:01:36 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I've never swatched Sheer Glow so I can't offer comparison based on that example, but if you're Ivory in Colorstay then I can offer suggestions!   If the C2 isn't a match, I'm a fan of Covergirl Trublend (I'm the lightest shade, Ivory), it's not as heavy as Colorstay but it still has nice coverage. Not sure how similar in formula it is to True Match though :/"
AustralianMakeup,304a6d,Jessijames,2,Tue Mar 24 11:10:50 2015 UTC,"C2 is definitely about as orange on me as W1. N1 & C1 look much lighter in online swatches I have seen, but yes it's unfortunately only available in Europe (The US version of the True Match is a totally different formula IMO). I am a NARS Siberia but can pull of Mont Blanc in summer with a little more colour on me."
AustralianMakeup,304a6d,thexcheshirexcat,1 point,Wed Mar 25 03:41:47 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the information. I made the mistake of ordering C2 online because I couldn't find it in ANY Priceline stores, so I'll see how it goes but if it doesn't work for me, I guess the $17 I spent isn't as bad as the $30 is usually is."
AustralianMakeup,304a6d,miss_marshwiggle,2,Wed Mar 25 06:25:06 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I've come to the realisation that unless I start fake tanning to match my foundation, I'm going to need to invest a little more in a higher-end brand. I just end up buying so many 'cheap' ($15-30) foundations in lighter shades that I may as well spend the $60 and buy MAC. I'm pale too (NW13) and finding nice drugstore foundations that aren't too pink or too orange is just so difficult, and that's without considering the formula. I went around swatching foundations in Priceline yesterday and I just wasn't convinced of any of them. I've tried the obvious ones such as ColorStay, but that stuff isn't even that cheap here!"
AustralianMakeup,304a6d,starla_,2,Wed Mar 25 04:28:49 2015 UTC,"I'm the same (NC10-ish, if it existed anymore). It's just worth paying a little more for high end stuff. Illamasqua are one of the few that do a range that even comes close to my skin tone."
AustralianMakeup,304a6d,rebcart,1 point,Thu Mar 26 02:36:57 2015 UTC,"if you want to stick with l'oreal, infallible is great and the lightest shade, vanilla, is very light and with cool undertones. as u/lemonlemonboom said though, covergirl trublend in ivory is also good. it's the palest foundation i can find on the cheap in Aus and is good for cool undertones. the C2 shade might be too dark for you but if you have cool undertones it would probably be a better match than W1, even if W1 is lighter."
AustralianMakeup,304a6d,ComingUpMilhouse,1 point,Tue Mar 24 23:59:52 2015 UTC,"I've been looking for a foundation too, maybe my new post will help you?"
AustralianMakeup,303ptz,jaded_elf,0,Tue Mar 24 05:28:44 2015 UTC,yes...that's generally how things like this work?
AustralianMakeup,303ptz,1ucy,0,Tue Mar 24 06:32:54 2015 UTC,"Well yes, you could call them that. But calling them free samples is also correct. After all they're free and they're sample size. There just happens to be criteria placed on who can get them.   At uni we have ""free sausage sizzles"" run by various clubs all the time. The sausages are free but you have to be a member to redem. This is no different"
AustralianMakeup,303ptz,1ucy,2,Tue Mar 24 11:36:11 2015 UTC,I might go to the Doncaster one in Victoria. Anyone else? I'm going alone atm haha

AustralianMakeup,302tso,cattcattcatt,9,Tue Mar 24 00:38:38 2015 UTC,I'm so confused why they would even do that? Most of the people I know use this sale to take advantage of cheap(er) Essence since it never goes on sale at any other time.  :/
AustralianMakeup,302tso,jamballdonut,7,Tue Mar 24 04:27:01 2015 UTC,I saw this. It seemed misleading to me as well. I wonder if people are going to post to the Priceline Facebook page. Shifting the blame onto the Essence brand is not right.
AustralianMakeup,302tso,WarlockPanda,3,Tue Mar 24 00:40:41 2015 UTC,I think I'll comment on their current top photo
AustralianMakeup,302tso,WarlockPanda,2,Tue Mar 24 03:08:17 2015 UTC,I can confirm that Indooroopilly Priceline has Essence for 40% off.
AustralianMakeup,302tso,KindOfOldNewGirl,1 point,Tue Mar 24 05:22:12 2015 UTC,The one in Albert Street has the sale - made the most of it today!
AustralianMakeup,302tso,meggsrox,1 point,Tue Mar 24 09:13:01 2015 UTC,Not exactly fair to blame Essence though when they are happy to be part of the sale! They could have easily put up a sign saying that due to stock reasons they will not be including Essence in the sale and to check out the other CBD stores for their products!
AustralianMakeup,303a0h,welcometotheartrave,4,Tue Mar 24 02:51:43 2015 UTC,"Any eyebrow pencil that matches your eyebrow colour would do. And most are packaged as their colour (brown, etc) so it's not like a pink coloured girly pencil or anything, if that's what you mean by needing a guy product? Gentle, soft, short strokes going the same direction as your hairs to fill in bare bits. I would say that's the best way for natural looking brows."
AustralianMakeup,303a0h,kittenishgirl,2,Tue Mar 24 03:15:33 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this, you can pick up one on Priceline/most chemists/Kmart/Target etc probably for around $10-$15 that will do the job just fine! :)"
AustralianMakeup,303a0h,Jessijames,1 point,Tue Mar 24 03:39:53 2015 UTC,Ah thanks so much! :D x
AustralianMakeup,303a0h,jamballdonut,5,Tue Mar 24 03:46:30 2015 UTC,"I really enjoy the Essence brow pencils (Although they only come in 3 shades), because they're cheap (around $4?) and buildable.  Depending on your hair colour, I'd go the colour down if you can, because that'll give more of a natural look.  Then you can just do short flicky strokes to add the presence of more hairs & it should do the job for you!"
AustralianMakeup,303a0h,Flippantry,2,Tue Mar 24 04:29:40 2015 UTC,"Yep, definitely +1 for these bad boys, I only wish they came in a bigger colour range.  They're really pretty amazing for their price and I've shunned more expensive pencils for these.    Grab an essence pencil sharpener too since they're cheap!  (don't be like me and use a random cheap sharpener, it ended up shredding my liners and got gunk everywhere!)"
AustralianMakeup,303a0h,Raging_Zef_Ladyboner,3,Tue Mar 24 04:45:30 2015 UTC,"Why do you have to use products marketed specifically towards men? There are plenty of tried and tested ""women's"" products out there."
AustralianMakeup,303a0h,ComingUpMilhouse,5,Tue Mar 24 03:08:07 2015 UTC,"Haha I don't mean specifically for men, I just mean something a guy can use as well. :)"
AustralianMakeup,303a0h,BlueRainstorm,1 point,Tue Mar 24 03:45:56 2015 UTC,I think /u/Raging_Zef_Ladyboner has a point and shouldn't be downvoted.

AustralianMakeup,303a0h,thexcheshirexcat,1 point,Tue Mar 24 21:26:54 2015 UTC,"Hey OP! So I've recently gotten Anastasia Beverly Hills Dipbrow Pomade off Beauty Bay. Was super cheap (~$15), had free shipping and came in a couple weeks. It's amazing. Makes my brows super natural looking and the best they've ever been. SUPER easy to use, too. I used to take forever to do my brows but now I only take a couple mins.  I really wish I had found this sooner and recommend you get on top of it!"
AustralianMakeup,303a0h,RemainingMemory,1 point,Thu Mar 26 09:14:09 2015 UTC,"I've been really liking Australis' brow tint. It's a thick liquid that comes with a spoolie applicator. It really defines the individual hairs. You need to use a very light hand and it does take a little practice, but I use this every day now! So much quicker than eyebrow powders in my opinion, though I haven't tried a pencil."
AustralianMakeup,303a0h,firsttimemidwife,3,Tue Mar 24 04:23:54 2015 UTC,I second the brow tint. I use the Maybelline Brow Drama in Dark Brown and it helps boost the appearance of your eyebrows while still looking natural.
AustralianMakeup,303a0h,RemainingMemory,2,Tue Mar 24 06:45:52 2015 UTC,"Uhh I want to love this since I just bought it, but the applicator and the abysmal setting power really disappoint me. I have to apply it with the applicator brush, then comb through a clear brow gel with a spoolie, by which point I've made a mess and need to clean up any smudges with a cotton tip :( I'm using it up because I love the full but natural effect, but I won't be repurchasing."
AustralianMakeup,303a0h,firsttimemidwife,1 point,Wed Mar 25 06:49:50 2015 UTC,"Oh, that sucks. I don't think I really notice when it's faded on me mostly just because my eyebrows don't need much upkeep since I have thick middle eastern eyebrows. It just gives them some oomph. I usually only use the little round ball end to brush through and that disperses the smallest amount of product. I'm sorry you had a bad experience with it, but your input was probably really helpful to anyone thinking of purchasing it. Thank you :)  Edit: I also kept reading 'setting power' as setting powder and was becoming increasing confused and wondering why I never got setting powder for it, hahah."
AustralianMakeup,303a0h,RemainingMemory,1 point,Wed Mar 25 07:39:37 2015 UTC,"I have unruly brows too! I meant more that I find the Maybelline doesn't keep them in place, so I have to use my australis one over the top to keep all the hairs in line. :)"
AustralianMakeup,303a0h,firsttimemidwife,1 point,Wed Mar 25 08:45:27 2015 UTC,OH. Damn son. Those are some strong-ass brows. The Australis gel looks really thick. Is it?
AustralianMakeup,303a0h,RemainingMemory,1 point,Wed Mar 25 09:07:26 2015 UTC,"It's quite wet, but more goopy than thick. It dries solid as a rock though, which you may love or hate, but you really just have to be careful not to overdo it and wipe a lot of the excess off.  edit. Have you tried the new Loreal brow gel? I was tempted to pick it up in the Priceline sale but I had only just bought the Maybelline one."
AustralianMakeup,303h1w,gospursgo_,1 point,Tue Mar 24 03:55:36 2015 UTC,"I found a review on makeup alley for it that was pretty favourable, the one thing that stood out to me was that they suggested it works best with runnier/creamier foundations, as it is a touch tacky so if you use a really thick or heavy matte foundation it can be a little trickier to work onto your face over the primer because the primer has more 'grip' if that makes any sense :/  I picked up a bottle today to so I will report back tomorrow if you can wait that long? :)"
AustralianMakeup,303h1w,Jessijames,1 point,Tue Mar 24 04:07:54 2015 UTC,"yes! i agree with that- i used it with Loreal Lumi magic, (which may have also been a culprit in the break out) and texture wise it worked well, couldnt imagine using with something thick or full coverage.  waiting for skin to calm down a bit anyway. will wait to hear from you!"
AustralianMakeup,303h1w,Chiacchierare,1 point,Tue Mar 24 04:16:16 2015 UTC,"I picked one up today too; I use the FaceFinity foundation usually, so will have to wait til tomorrow to see how the primer goes with it! The foundation doesn't make me break out, so if I do, I know I can blame it on the primer! I tried a bit on the back of my hand and it seems quite runny - I think I expected it to be a bit thicker for some reason..."
AustralianMakeup,303oul,lastmindisaster,2,Tue Mar 24 05:16:48 2015 UTC,"I just bought a beach tint in Fig and I love it. Very sheer, but I read lots of reviews beforehand, so I knew to expect that.   I got mine from Adore Beauty and it was cheaper than RRP, but still not cheap."
AustralianMakeup,303oul,amyeh,1 point,Wed Mar 25 03:15:04 2015 UTC,"Kinda sorta dupe and that's the Stila Convertible Cheek colour. Usually  $40 though each - at the moment at Mecca though they have a LE Spring Trio (2 sets) where you get 3 half size ones. $26 each for a set of 3. Best 26 bucks I've spent. I use them both daily. Cheeks, lips, transition on my brow even if I'm taking my day look to night to go out and need a lift. They're awesome.   If I knew it was coming to Aus (I called mecca but they said no) I would have got the Stila Lip/Cheek Palette instead. Not cheap at $60ish+ but you get every single damn colour they make. That's 12 shades... It's STUNNING!!!  http://www.myqt.com/collections/stila/products/stila-field-of-florals-convertible-color-dual-lip-cheek-palette  Not sure if i'm helping though.   On the other end of the spectrum - Korean lip tints might be more what you're looking for. They have a great range of colours and are super cheap. Try some from Etude House or Tony Moly. I love the Skinfood Tomato Cool Jelly Tints (the liquid jelly not the gloss). They look really great on lips and cheeks and easily available n ebay super cheap - (around $8 from memory. )  Hope that helps!"

Product List:   Rimmel Lasting Finish 1000 Kisses Lip Liner 061 Wine ($5.10) Rimmel Lasting Finish 1000 Kisses Lip Liner 014 Wild Clover ($5.10) Australis Velourlips Matte Lip Cream Bar-tha-lona ($5.97) Australis Velourlips Matte Lip Cream Doo-bai ($5.97) Australis Velourlips Matte Lip Cream Shang-hi ($5.97) Australis Velourlips Matte Lip Cream Ma-li-boo ($5.97) Savvy Cheek & Lip Colour Plush Plum ($5.39) Essence Good Girl Bad Girl Lipstick Caught in the middle ($2.82) Essence Good Girl Bad Girl Lipstick It wasn't me! ($2.82) Maybelline Full N' Soft Mascara Very Black ($8.97) Essence Get Big! Lashes Volume Curl Mascara ($2.82) Natio Ageless Illuminating Primer ($10.17) Burjois Happy Light Luminous Serum Primer ($12.60) (Repurchase) Savvy Kohl Eyeliner Black x 2 ($3.00 ea)   Total Spend: $85.66  Regular Price: $142.77  Total Savings: $57.11  BONUS ROUND  So I was a little bit cheeky and while I was in a makeup buying mood I also hit up my local K-mart and Reject Shop. Don't laugh! I always check my reject shop for makeup because every now and then they have some amazing things from some of our favourite brands for very cheap. Allow me to demonstrate:  2nd mini-haul, Kmart and Reject Shop.  Product List:   Face of Australia Eye Kit Liquid eyeliner, Eyedefiner pencil liner, Glamorous Lashes waterproof mascara (Reject Shop $8) Maybelline Coloursensational Lipstick 109 Rosy Dream (Reject Shop $6) ELF Eyeshadow Brush (Kmart $3) BYS Blush Trio Heart Skipped a Beat (Kmart $5.75) ELF Studio Lip Exfoliator (Kmart $8) ELF Dual Pencil Sharpener (Kmart $3)   Just a few final notes before I hit save:  The Velourlips in Bar-tha-lona is a perfect dupe for MAC's Retro Matte Lipstick in 'Relentlessly Red'. (Velourlips on top, MAC on the bottom)  ELF's Lip Exfoliator is the most amazing thing ever. Really exfoliates and smells and tastes good too. It left my lips feeling beautiful and smooth and a little bit tingly.  The Burjois primer feels like silk, slightly better than the Natio one which feels a little watery, similar to the Australis Face Primer, but the quality is much better.  The Maybelline Full N'Soft Mascara is already my first HG Mascara, The FOA one from the Reject Shop is pretty comparable to it though.  That's the end!"

AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,ksg1,7,Tue Mar 24 23:22:04 2015 UTC,"Just got back! Really happy with re-buying some of my basics and trying out new products you guys have recommended!

AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,xenomorphic_acid,5,Tue Mar 24 09:52:13 2015 UTC,Can't post pictures but 2 priceline stores down and I'm $140 lighter and have a large amount of lip products - which is scary because I don't wear lipstick - my medication makes my lips peel. But looks like I'm dedicating myself to wearing lip stick more often!
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,lady_hazel,14,Tue Mar 24 02:22:52 2015 UTC,Every single one of you better be on a no buy after this!
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,gemawo,9,Tue Mar 24 04:56:57 2015 UTC,I'll be on a no-buy until Target puts NYX on sale! :)
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,xenomorphic_acid,3,Tue Mar 24 05:08:43 2015 UTC,"Not sure what NYX you have tried but I definitely recommend the dewy setting spray and the matte lipstick in ""Whipped Caviar"" :)"
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,xenomorphic_acid,4,Tue Mar 24 06:15:36 2015 UTC,It's 30% off NYX at the moment
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,gemawo,2,Tue Mar 24 08:49:16 2015 UTC,REALLY?! flails I've been checking every now and then and it's still normal price...maybe I need to get into a store tomorrow! Thankyou!
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,xenomorphic_acid,2,Tue Mar 24 10:06:21 2015 UTC,I just checked my pile of junk mail - it goes on sale on Thursday :)
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,lady_hazel,1 point,Tue Mar 24 10:22:08 2015 UTC,"Haha oops I work there, should probably have known that"
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,xenomorphic_acid,1 point,Tue Mar 24 12:43:24 2015 UTC,"I have the dewy setting spray actually, I love it! :) I don't have any of their matte lipsticks though, and I've been meaning to try one, how do they compare to the round ones? (I love NYX, I'd say they are at least a third of my small makeup collection)"
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,RipperReeta,3,Tue Mar 24 06:30:00 2015 UTC,The matte lipsticks that I have tried (with whipped caviar being my favourite) have the creaminess of the round lipsticks but are longer lasting. They are also quite opaque. Sometimes I mix whipped caviar with thalia or minimalism (round lipsticks) for a more satin look.
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,xenomorphic_acid,2,Tue Mar 24 06:36:03 2015 UTC,"That sounds perfect for me then! I'll definitely try them next time I'm in Target, thanks for the recommendation. :)"
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,Azazael,3,Tue Mar 24 09:57:05 2015 UTC,Unless Target do a 50% off  - I'm sticking with BlueScandal.com
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,missb00,2,Tue Mar 24 06:42:02 2015 UTC,"I've been using Cherry Culture when they have their 40% off sales, but their range is so small now I'm thinking next time I'll go to BlueScandal. I can't just rely on Target anyway, because they also have a small NYX range."
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,pondicus,1 point,Tue Mar 24 09:51:40 2015 UTC,Checked out Blue Scandal - they're out of stock of all the soft matte lip cremes - I lost my make up bag today containing among other things my beloved Prague

AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,freezethefire,3,Tue Mar 24 05:35:40 2015 UTC,I'm already on a No Buy - this thread exists for me to live vicariously through everyone's hauls!!!
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,criti_biti,6,Tue Mar 24 05:35:44 2015 UTC,"Yayyyy my order just went through and the only thing I missed out on was an essence lipliner.    Bourjois happy light foundation 51 Australis ready, set, go powder Australis curve ink eyeliner Models Prefer soft touch powders (all of them because they feel so lovely and I couldn't not) Models Prefer soft touch blush in the Autumn shade Essence lipliners in cute pink, red blush, soft berry (missed out on in the nude) She pure magic primer Maybelline colour drama pencil in berry much Revlon just bitten kissable balm in honey Revlon colourburst matte balm in sultry   I'm so happy with all of this, I haven't bought anything since the last 40% off sale and it's all things that have been on my list for a while.   edit: went in store to find the Maybelline fitme concealer that was sold out online, walked out with AC/ME velourlips Grandmaster Pash and Noo-D Fighters instead. Still happy.   edit the second: went to yet another store to find a concealer, left with Max Factor master touch undereye concealer, Max Factor creme puff blush in seductive pink, Models Prefer mineral blush in winter's end, Australis fresh & flawless pressed powder in natural, and the Essence in the nude lipliner I missed out on online this morning. All in all very pleased with today and now to lock myself in a room so I don't go out another time."
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,pondicus,2,Mon Mar 23 21:44:22 2015 UTC,"This is such a good list! I love both sultry and honey, I just got the she primer myself, the essence lip liners are amazing and so is the models prefer mineral touch powder! Hope you love it all."
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,criti_biti,2,Tue Mar 24 00:27:56 2015 UTC,She pure magic primer   Never heard of this. Is this good? :)
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,Uterus_Juicer,3,Tue Mar 24 02:33:28 2015 UTC,Everyone's been talking about it for a couple weeks because priceline is going to no longer stock She cosmetics. Apparently it's a dupe for hourglass or benefit something or other. I haven't got mine yet but I'm not super picky about primers anyway. I'll do a little mini review when I get it if you like? I know there's other people here that have/use/like it as well.
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,Artemisian11,2,Tue Mar 24 03:04:50 2015 UTC,"I would be totally up for reading that review if you do - I'm almost out of my Hourglass primer, but I dunno if I want to fork out all the $$$ for it again. If you could do a comparison of ingredients too, that would amazing!"
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,RipperReeta,2,Tue Mar 24 05:19:33 2015 UTC,"Oooh I've never done this before it will be fun. Shipping takes so long after these sales though, I'm not going to move from my front door for the next few weeks."
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,missb00,2,Tue Mar 24 05:23:30 2015 UTC,"Hey! I have the SHE pure magic primer, the ingredients are:     Dimethicone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone crosspolymer, Silica, Dimethicone/vinyl dimethicone crosspolymer, Polymethyl methacrylate, Isononyl isononanoate, Prunus amygdalus dulcis (Sweet almond) oil, Tocopheryl acetate, Aluminum hydroxide, Dimethicone/methicone copolymer, Cl 77891 (Titanium dioxide), Cl 77492 (Iron oxides), Cl 77491 (Iron oxides) Cl 77499 (Iron oxides).     Hope it helps :)"
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,WarlockPanda,1 point,Tue Mar 24 09:57:01 2015 UTC,"I got the primer last 40% sale, and I like it. Good dupe for Porefessional IMO."
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,missb00,1 point,Tue Mar 24 06:25:35 2015 UTC,"It's phenomenal. I bought 2, as I heard the rumour about Priceline no longer stocking them."
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,sparklewolves,5,Tue Mar 24 06:44:32 2015 UTC,"I'm at home today, since I've been sick. So I came, I saw, I conquered before everything sold out or the site crashed. Can't wait to have these in my hot little hands."
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,brucewaynes,1 point,Mon Mar 23 22:45:31 2015 UTC,No kidding. Looks like you'll have a nice haul coming your way.
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,annimus_prime,3,Tue Mar 24 00:08:46 2015 UTC,"This is the first sale where I've had a full time, well-paid job. Usually I just get bits and bobs, but this time I could afford to try things."
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,Artemisian11,6,Tue Mar 24 00:57:01 2015 UTC,"I really feel like I should have bought more, but I HATE spending. I will now proceed to consume $30 of nachos and wine in one sitting   Australis Velourlips in Doo-Bai ($5.97) Models Prefer soft touch powder in photo ready ($10.19) Essence gel eyeliner pencils in Black Blaze and Cocoa Bean ($2.82 each) Covergirl Clump Crusher mascara ($10.77) Maybelline Color Tattoo in Inked in Pink ($7.17) Rimmel Match Perfection highlighter/concealer ($8.37) Essence lip liner in In the Nude ($1.20)   Total = $49.31  I just had a huge (for me anyway) haul of clothes arrive yesterday as well. I feel so fresh, so new."
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,brucewaynes,6,Tue Mar 24 09:32:16 2015 UTC,"Just went in and got mine! Kind of wish I'd grabbed some other things I'd ummed and ahhed over seeing as it's so cheap, but I'm meant to be being good! Although, to be fair, the bulk of my purchase was spent on my foundation & primer. Anyway...   Revlon Colorstay Foundation for Dry Skin Revlon Photoready Perfecting Primer (I've never actually used a primer before so I figure it's about time I give it a go, hopefully I bought the right thing!) Maybelline Hyper Glossy Liquid Liner (My liquid liner's - Revlon Colorstay - just not doing the job. Too opaque. Hopefully this works.) Australis Ready Set Go Finishing Powder Covergirl Clump Crusher Extension (Everyone raves about CC so I thought I'd give it a go. I don't know about the extension thing though???)   I feel like maybe I should have picked up a lipstick or two as well but /heavy breathing/. I was also eyeing of the AC On Tour kit but I've never contoured so I don't know if I'd actually use it, but there was only one there!!"
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,thexcheshirexcat,6,Mon Mar 23 22:41:55 2015 UTC,I'm meant to be being good!   Take some advice from Wreck-it Ralph. ;)
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,brucewaynes,3,Tue Mar 24 01:07:55 2015 UTC,"I really like the Hyper Glossy, it's my everyday liner. Really easy to be precise, and it does NOT budge. Can be difficult to clean off!"
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,somnizon,1 point,Tue Mar 24 06:27:13 2015 UTC,Awesome! I'm glad to hear positive reviews. Fingers crossed I'm a step closer to my HG liner!
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,breviloquent-,2,Tue Mar 24 06:31:16 2015 UTC,Ohhh I was eyeing off the Clump Crusher extension mascara...please let us know how it goes!
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,ComingUpMilhouse,1 point,Tue Mar 24 00:33:04 2015 UTC,"Clump Crusher is pretty good! The wand is great and it's not too liquidy. However, water causes it to smudge. I don't know why, I thought I bought the waterproof one but oh well."
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,breviloquent-,2,Tue Mar 24 02:43:44 2015 UTC,How can something be too opaque? Did you mean transparent?
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,ComingUpMilhouse,1 point,Wed Mar 25 09:48:02 2015 UTC,That's the one.
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,WarlockPanda,1 point,Wed Mar 25 10:25:55 2015 UTC,"I don't find much difference between extensions and regular CC. That said, I buy extensions anyway and I love it."
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,dark_lane,5,Tue Mar 24 01:52:58 2015 UTC,So I went at 8am and got out by 8:20ish (and went into 3 pricelines).  The woman overcharged me and scanned a blush twice and also didnt scan my card even though I gave it to her but i dont think its worth the bother to go get the money back tbh.  I got   both Essence Blush Ups Models Prefer Soft Touch Models Prefer Spring Fling blush Essence gloss (forgot the name right now but will edit later)   Savvy Blushes in Rose and Plum Maybelline Nude Perfection Maybelline Fit Me Concealer   Essence Cream to Powder Highlight Australis Fresh and Flawless Australis Velourlips in Doobai
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,dark_lane,2,Mon Mar 23 23:05:29 2015 UTC,"I would certainly go back about the blush, the priceline card thing is annoying but the blush means you paid more than 100%"
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,dark_lane,1 point,Wed Mar 25 11:02:32 2015 UTC,"It was $4 or something and for me it's not worth the time going - the priceline is quite far for me and I'd have to bring all the stuff I bought. If it was closer and the money more, I would totally go back"
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,criti_biti,1 point,Wed Mar 25 11:04:28 2015 UTC,"That really sucks, maybe contact them on Facebook and explain your situation?"
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,criti_biti,6,Wed Mar 25 11:05:34 2015 UTC,"Okay, went to the Priceline at Canberra Centre at 8:30am. Very disappointed. They were understocked, didn't have Australis Velourlips in Buda-pash nor Doo-bai. Didn't even have Maybelline Fitme Stick in 130. A lot of the products were unsealed and used.   Bought only three things: http://imgur.com/lmwxRi3   Savvy Classic Blush in Rose $4.99 --> $2.99 L'Oreal Miss Manga Mascara in All Black $21.95 --> $13.17 Models Prefer Mineral Powder Soft Touch in Luminous Glow $16.99 --> $10.19   Now I'm shopping online for the rest. Will upload pic of my shopping cart later :)  Edit: spent another $60 online  http://imgur.com/lLOtehm  Total: $87.27 (before discount $145.45, saved $58.18)"
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,dark_lane,2,Mon Mar 23 23:29:56 2015 UTC,I bought the Miss Manga Mascara in purple. I'm actually excited to try it.
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,criti_biti,2,Tue Mar 24 00:06:42 2015 UTC,I'm excited for you too!
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,jamballdonut,2,Tue Mar 24 02:38:18 2015 UTC,I went in to Canberra centre at 1130 and they were stocking some of the shelves then- ridiculous because that tiny corner got so packed by 1145 that they couldn't move.
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,pumpkinspicevodka,1 point,Tue Mar 24 02:20:09 2015 UTC,"Oh I should've gone later then, would've saved myself $10 online shipping fee. Oh well"
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,jamballdonut,3,Tue Mar 24 02:23:06 2015 UTC,The $10 was probably worth it to not have to deal with lunch time crowds! It was getting frantic.
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,jamballdonut,1 point,Tue Mar 24 02:29:10 2015 UTC,Did you spot Australis Buda-pash or Doo-bai?
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,Tea_inthegoodroom,2,Tue Mar 24 02:31:51 2015 UTC,Not when I was in there. Sorry. If you're nearby you might want to pop in tomorrow morning.  I've always found 1st thing of the second sale day has the best stock because they tidy up at closing time.
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,HRM_Monster,2,Tue Mar 24 02:40:20 2015 UTC,"Belconnen has them, they also have the AC/ME velourlips. Tuggeranong, Woden and Belconnen were all finished restocking by yesterday evening so it's disappointing that Civic was so behind."
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,jamballdonut,1 point,Tue Mar 24 05:10:15 2015 UTC,The Civic store really sucks.
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,HRM_Monster,1 point,Tue Mar 24 05:14:40 2015 UTC,"I know, I pretty much avoid it at all costs. Belconnen is my fave, I'm pretty sure its got the most different stands which is nice. And it was less busy than both Tuggeranong and Woden, since I hit up all three today."

Seemed like a good match for my fairly pale skin in store but oxidised like crazy to a really dark yellow after being on my face for 20 or so minutes :( I hope it works better for you and mine was just a dud!  Love your YouTube videos btw!"
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,missb00,3,Tue Mar 24 06:15:27 2015 UTC,"Aw no! I swatched it on my face just before & was fairly impressed with the small section I tried, so I should probably go check and see if it's done the same to me!

AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,WarlockPanda,1 point,Tue Mar 24 06:18:52 2015 UTC,Did you find out? Did it change colour on you?
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,jamballdonut,2,Tue Mar 24 07:53:09 2015 UTC,"From what I can see, it kinda just disappeared off my face! I'm gonna try it out properly tomorrow & see how it goes! But, so far, no oxidisation, I think?!"
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,ComingUpMilhouse,1 point,Tue Mar 24 08:43:03 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I had N2 originally and it oxidised into a mauvey pink colour. Neutral my ass The W1 doesn't even set, and with a powder it just turns into a bit of a paste. Boo L'Oreal!"
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,seenoright,2,Tue Mar 24 09:03:21 2015 UTC,"Enjoy the MP soft touch powder in photo ready, it is fantastic. I dust it all over my face before I put on my bb cream (Wayne Goss method) and it gives me a nice glowy look that stays perfect all day :)"
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,ladyduckula,3,Wed Mar 25 10:55:31 2015 UTC,That's probably similar to what I'll be doing! Or even just dusting over my t-zone/chin/cheeks/areas that need a little extra coverage and a little glow

You do a great job, I look forward to your reviews :)   I love the pinky cool tone of the powder, I'm absurdly dry skinned and pale, so I have been known to use it as a setting powder as well."
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,missb00,1 point,Wed Mar 25 11:25:52 2015 UTC,"JOTWRFLR you have to test out the essence palette and tell me how it is NOW! I uhmmed and ahhed over that one in store a little while ago, and it wasn't online. And if it's like the foiled shadows, I NEED IT!"
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,ComingUpMilhouse,2,Tue Mar 24 05:37:59 2015 UTC,"Give me like 20 minutes, and I'll go try it out.  I don't have any primer on me though, so I can only let you know how it goes with finger swatches, if that's okay??"
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,greencatredcat,1 point,Tue Mar 24 05:39:42 2015 UTC,That's fine! I just wanna know so I can pick it up after work tomorrow =]
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,swarlzbarkly,2,Tue Mar 24 05:47:07 2015 UTC,"Alright, I just did some swatchy swatches, and I'm really impressed! I've never actually tried foiled shadows, and heard they were similar from someone else, but they feel quite... fluffy? I think I may actually go back and buy the ""bad girl"" version too, because I'm so impressed with how well these came out.  I pushed my finger in quite hard for the white swatch and it came out SO pigmented that I did slightly less pressure for the rest, haha, so these are all one finger swipe! Linky link"

This stuff better be good!) Australis Make-Up Finishing Spritz Australis lip pencil in Nudie Rudie Velourlips: Doo-Bai, Shang-Hai, Hon-O-Loo-Loo, Tok-I-O, Ny-Cee Savvy Mineral Baked Blush in Blossom (this is just...oh my god. AMAZING. It's so shimmery and beautiful) Maybelline Fit Me concealer in 01 Light   I also picked up a double pack of the Simple face cleansing wipes and Aveeno body wash. Then I went next door to Sportsgirl, where the 'Pout about it' lipstick in Wanderlust was on sale for $4.95! It's a really pretty lavender shade.  MULTIPLE EDITS: Formatting.

I'm sorry to say that Australis' Makeup finishing spritz is pretty useless :( But at least you got it cheap! Neither of my local pricelines had Tok-I-O in stock and it was something I really wanted :( Maybe tomorrow I'll try a different priceline.
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,lady_hazel,1 point,Tue Mar 24 03:44:39 2015 UTC,Oh I love the setting spray! This is my third repurchase :) I just put it in a different bottle as their pump spray is awful

I am planning on getting a few more and making a post comparing the lot of them. I should probably add though that I ride a motorbike and due to helmet issues, I really need a lot from a setting spray!"

AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,DiabolicalCheesecake,5,Tue Mar 24 04:29:25 2015 UTC,"First of all, I went into my closest store, Hobart cbd, where I bought most things on my list. They were out of stock of the Revlon polish I really wanted, but I checked chemist warehouse and it was sitting on top of a $5 clearance bin. I also really wanted Grandmaster Pash, and drove out to Kingston because I'd seen it in a discount bin a few weeks ago (didn't buy it because it was still full price) and luckily there was one left! They also had a little box of OPI, which the city store didn't have, so it wasn't a waste of petrol, I swear. :)  Imgur   Models Prefer brush cleaner - $7.79 Revlon nail polish - Timeless - $1.80 (clearance bin $3) Revlon nail polish - Elusive - $5.00 (chemist warehouse) Max Factor nail polish - Blackout - $1.20 (clearance bin $2) FOA Dark Side nail polish - Ursula $1.20 (clearance bin $2) FOA Dark Side nail polish - Mystique $1.20 (clearance bin $2) FOA Dark Side nail polish - Wicked Witch of the West $1.20 (clearance bin $2) OPI nail polish - Russian Navy $6.00 Models Prefer Soft Touch powder - Soft Focus $10.19 Australis Velourlips - Doo-Bai - $5.97 Australis Velourlips - Buda-Pash - $5.97 Australis Velourlips - Grandmaster Pash - $5.97 Australis Matte Me lipstick base - $7.77 Essence sharpener - $0.54 (clearance bin $0.90) Rimmel Provocalips - Play With Fire - $10.77 Models Prefer green concealer pen - $7.19 Models Prefer lip liner - Clearly Sealed - $5.39   I'm really happy, I got everything I'd been saving for (birthday cash from the beginning of JANUARY!) and there weren't too many people this morning to make it stressful. I'm still thinking about going back for: Australis colour inject lipstick in Grunge, Rimmel Provocalips in Dare to Pink and to check the clearance bins at the other Hobart stores. I usually find some good stuff in there anyway, but with 40% off as well you can find some real bargains!"

I had to ask a sales assistant to check the drawers for both the powders and the Doo-Bai Velour Lips, so my pro tip is always ask if there's no stock on the shelf! $38 all up.

AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,StanleyTheGrapefruit,2,Tue Mar 24 07:30:38 2015 UTC,"I know some smaller ones in Sydney cbd dont, I think they are also often missing other brands like she, savvy or essence."
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,missalmg,1 point,Tue Mar 24 07:38:37 2015 UTC,Come to think of it I didn't see savvy or essence either! Wonder why
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,Joolebear,1 point,Tue Mar 24 08:26:06 2015 UTC,I think if they're a franchise they don't always stock all of the usual Priceline brands.
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,Waffleshoot,2,Tue Mar 24 23:13:58 2015 UTC,"I got the bourjois healthy mix foundation based on recs here. I also got an essence eyeliner, so annoyed that I accidentally grabbed one that has clearly been opened and tested so I will have to try exchanging or returning it tomorrow. I may pick up other things tomorrow as well!"
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,HRM_Monster,2,Tue Mar 24 08:17:53 2015 UTC,I had the same issue! SO many products were already opened despite there being a clear tester. Why people WHY?!?
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,Waffleshoot,1 point,Tue Mar 24 08:57:08 2015 UTC,Please tell me how it goes with the exchange/return. A dear friend of mine sworn off Priceline when she couldn't exchange her Rimmel lip product when the balm was clearly used. Perhaps it was how it was handled. I want to share the things I got today at the sale with my friend but I feel like it would be rude to do so.
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,HRM_Monster,2,Tue Mar 24 08:58:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'll report back, hopefully with a positive outcome!"
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,Waffleshoot,2,Tue Mar 24 10:12:28 2015 UTC,"Managed to get it exchanged, yay! Did it at one of the counters"

More of a lengthener than volumiser."
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,gluckenspork,2,Tue Mar 24 14:08:28 2015 UTC,Had a list and I was in and out in 15 mins (I looked like I was on a game show).

AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,jen-iscool,1 point,Wed Mar 25 14:18:07 2015 UTC,I would love to hear your opinion on the essence silky touch blush and the highlighter. I wanted to try the blush but I was worried about pigmentation.
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,rebcart,2,Wed Mar 25 17:25:39 2015 UTC,"I've been really impressed by both of them!  I originally only purchased the blush, but after trying it that night and the next morning, I went back to pick up the highlighter too.  The blush pigment seems good to me. My old blush requires a lot of product to get enough pigment to be noticeable at all. The Essence one really only requires one light sweep for a subtle colour, but can also build up quite well. 'Silky touch' is a pretty good name- it has a little shimmer to it but only enough to pick up a bit of light and make my cheeks glow. It's a good everyday replacement for my old one, which has now been binned!  The highlighter also seems pretty good. I'm new to highlighters, but it's quite easy to apply and the creaminess lets me blend it into my base of foundation for subtle highlights. By my standards, both last quite well during a long day in the office."
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,Waffleshoot,1 point,Thu Mar 26 13:05:10 2015 UTC,That sounds great I might try to track one down tomorrow. I really do love essence. What blush did you use previously?
AustralianMakeup,2zzy5n,hez_lea,1 point,Fri Mar 27 05:51:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I wasn't sure what I was expecting but I'm very impressed by most of my Essence haul!  I'm 90% sure the old blush was Maybelline. I'm think it's still sitting in my empty bin, but I won't be back there for a couple of weeks! Happy to check for you when I return though."

AustralianMakeup,2zzspn,gospursgo_,1 point,Mon Mar 23 12:34:24 2015 UTC,"If I don't make a list, I'll just wander around forever and buy too much! I've had to think about what very carefully because I've only got a small budget, and haven't bought anything at priceline for ages, waiting for this sale. Hopefully I'll still enjoy it though! :)"
AustralianMakeup,2zzspn,xenomorphic_acid,2,Mon Mar 23 12:46:30 2015 UTC,"Same here! My first sale was the one a year ago, and I bought stuff from two different stores, plus an online order, because I got just about everything I saw and decided I wanted."
AustralianMakeup,2zzspn,blackgirldownunder,4,Mon Mar 23 13:11:49 2015 UTC,"I'm on a foundation hunt (suggestions for oily and fair skin?) and I want to try a few bits and bobs that have me curious but not willing to pay full price for, like the new matte Rimmel apocalips things and the loreal eyebrow gel."
AustralianMakeup,2zzspn,alyss0r,3,Mon Mar 23 09:53:58 2015 UTC,Bourjois Healthy Mix might be a good option..? Their lightest shade No. 51 is around NC15 from Google swatches (I could be so wrong though) - and it's the most yellow-based drugstore foundation I've personally found.
AustralianMakeup,2zzspn,pondicus,1 point,Mon Mar 23 13:04:41 2015 UTC,"I might look it up and see, but I don't think any of my local pricelines stock more than like, three shades of the bourjois foundations :("
AustralianMakeup,2zzspn,alyss0r,1 point,Mon Mar 23 20:59:43 2015 UTC,"Booooo.. Maybe ask the shop girl? My friend works at a Priceline and she says sometimes they get too busy to put stock out. Good luck!   Worst case scenario, I know ASOS sells Bourjois - so if you don't get it today or tomorrow, you can always try online :)"
AustralianMakeup,2zzspn,pondicus,1 point,Mon Mar 23 22:31:00 2015 UTC,I might try get it online because I don't think any pricelines near me stock the lighter shades at all. Thanks! :)
AustralianMakeup,2zzspn,alyss0r,2,Tue Mar 24 09:29:26 2015 UTC,"Covergirl Outlast Stay Fabulous 3-in-1 is a miracle for oily skin. Seems to suck up the oil, and doesn't go greasy. Just watch out for any dry patches, as it will cling like a motherhugger."
AustralianMakeup,2zzspn,missb00,1 point,Mon Mar 23 13:56:59 2015 UTC,"I've heard good things, and it's the only thing today that I am definitely buying :D"
AustralianMakeup,2zzspn,alyss0r,1 point,Mon Mar 23 20:58:56 2015 UTC,"Go get em! Just be aware that they all seem to be fairly pink toned, at least the lighter shades."
AustralianMakeup,2zzspn,missb00,1 point,Mon Mar 23 22:21:02 2015 UTC,Went in and the lightest shade looked like fake tan on me. Boo :( I was so disappointed because I really had my mind set on it

AustralianMakeup,2zzspn,turtleonitsback1,5,Tue Mar 24 04:53:52 2015 UTC,I was considering a new foundation but I'm a NC15 so everything makes me pink and others are too dark so make me orange...
AustralianMakeup,2zzspn,Tough_Princess,2,Mon Mar 23 09:51:55 2015 UTC,"Omg I'm the same. I'm sort of mixing the lightest two of Revlon's Colorstay to get a compromise of close to the right tone and close to light enough, and just blending really far down my neck... I tried L'Oréal True Match W1 and it was too dark :/"
AustralianMakeup,2zzspn,WithNarwhalsBaconing,2,Mon Mar 23 10:52:11 2015 UTC,I was at target and went along the entire wall. Nothing.  I was at Myer and the lady tried to match me to I think L'Oreal it was so pink the contrast or my skin was like wearing blush. I went to MAC and I asked the girl am I crazy or something I am positive I have yellow undertones but I keep being matched to pink tones.  She says no you are yellow but pale and not much is designed for you. She was right...
AustralianMakeup,2zzspn,Tough_Princess,3,Mon Mar 23 11:04:45 2015 UTC,"Not drugstore, but the only mainstream brand yellow enough for me was NARS! Siberia is their palest shade, which may or may not help you? Bourjois comes close in the yellow stakes, but it still a tad pink."
AustralianMakeup,2zzspn,pondicus,1 point,Mon Mar 23 13:00:37 2015 UTC,U/rebcart posted an album with NARS siberia and it looks so close. I have never looked at the brand before to be honest.  It's popular but never felt like it was for me. And Urban Decay's Naked Skin has some possible matches but is light/medium coverage which isn't what i want. I get that from BB cream and powder.   I may look at bourjois even if it still is a bit pink my Rosey Irish cheeks may help me. I swear I have no idea how my heritage gave me yellow undertones... I think it was to screw with me :/
AustralianMakeup,2zzspn,Tough_Princess,1 point,Mon Mar 23 14:37:05 2015 UTC,UD Naked Skin is most definitely at least medium but easily buildable to full coverage and is holy grail for me! I'm a NARS Siberia and 0.5 in the UD is a decent match!
AustralianMakeup,2zzspn,Jessijames,1 point,Mon Mar 23 20:58:06 2015 UTC,Maybe I will get a sample of both at Mecca thankyou
AustralianMakeup,2zzspn,Tough_Princess,1 point,Tue Mar 24 00:35:57 2015 UTC,"Definitely try it, I love it :)"
AustralianMakeup,2zzspn,Jessijames,1 point,Tue Mar 24 01:22:18 2015 UTC,Bourjois was a great match thanks for suggesting it. I bought it. May help you I tested the healthy mix and the perfect 123 and the perfect 123 was a little more yellow yet still no.51
AustralianMakeup,2zzspn,Tough_Princess,1 point,Tue Mar 24 07:45:52 2015 UTC,"Awesome! Glad to hear it :) I am very slowly working through a Bourjois Healthy Mix in No. 53 - I barely 20% into it, even with everyday use for the past 3 months. I'll have to check the Perfect 123 tomorrow - thanks for the tip!"
AustralianMakeup,2zzspn,pondicus,1 point,Tue Mar 24 08:29:09 2015 UTC,"Agree with Nars Siberia! I'm very pale neutral, but I prefer to go with yellow undertones because it cancels pinkness if I have any spots. Not a foundation, but I really like the HolikaHolika Petit Jelly BB cream in the lightest shade :)"
AustralianMakeup,2zzspn,Tough_Princess,1 point,Tue Mar 24 00:35:34 2015 UTC,I haven't tried holikaholika. I am using the four pack sample of skin79 or missha I can't decide out of them which I like - it isn't really missha I was sucked in by everyone else saying they liked it and have a full size. I'm on mecca looking at NARS now oh god my wallet.
AustralianMakeup,2zzspn,_yoshiii,1 point,Tue Mar 24 00:47:30 2015 UTC,"Missha Perfect cover is great but the 13 shade is a bit too pink for nc15, 21 is too ashy and grey.  :(    I found Skin79 orange and green to be the best matches. Orange is amazing but I think Green is much much closer."
AustralianMakeup,2zzspn,Tough_Princess,1 point,Tue Mar 24 06:06:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah I used to go over it lightly with MAC then powder. So using it was pointless.  The sample skin 79 didn't have orange or green. It has pink, gold and two silver ones.... I think."
AustralianMakeup,2zzspn,_yoshiii,1 point,Tue Mar 24 07:40:24 2015 UTC,"Oooh, try and get some samples of the green (palest, probably close to NARS Siberia, yellow toned, I think for combo skin) and orange is for oily skin, a little bit more beige but still quite yellow and pale! :)"
AustralianMakeup,2zzspn,Tough_Princess,1 point,Tue Mar 24 08:53:45 2015 UTC,I will give it a go when I have gone through all my BB creams thanks :).
AustralianMakeup,2zzspn,rebcart,2,Tue Mar 24 08:57:12 2015 UTC,"You sound very similar to me! I'm currently on a foundation quest and have been doing swatches, maybe you'll like something in this mix?  Album 1 (incl. Priceline brands) Album 2 (Revlon Colorstay + sephora/Mecca brands)"
AustralianMakeup,2zzspn,Tough_Princess,1 point,Mon Mar 23 11:27:55 2015 UTC,Of course I immediately looked at NARS... I may go check out Revlon colorstay again maybe I got jaded. Thanks so much
AustralianMakeup,2zzspn,missb00,1 point,Mon Mar 23 11:38:01 2015 UTC,"The Nude by Nature mineral powder in light is an excellent match for me, good to see it in your list =]  If you get the chance, I would LOVE swatches of the new Nars."
AustralianMakeup,2zzspn,rebcart,1 point,Mon Mar 23 13:56:00 2015 UTC,"Actually, all these swatches are of liquids!   What's the new nars? I'm probably going back in tomorrow for more samples in case there's something worth getting in the Priceline sale, so I'll see if they have anything."
AustralianMakeup,2zzspn,missb00,1 point,Mon Mar 23 14:02:42 2015 UTC,"Oh! I just saw Nude by Nature light and squee'd lmao.   The ""new Nars"" is the luminous weightless foundation.

I've had two of these now, and both times it's been far from opaque and has seemed to dry out almost instantaneously after I start applying.

AustralianMakeup,2zzspn,Kotetsu,2,Mon Mar 23 11:36:36 2015 UTC,"I don't really get the hype of them as well, I usually buy it if I don't have an online makeup haul (I prefer Asian liquid eyeliners)."
AustralianMakeup,2zzspn,WarlockPanda,1 point,Mon Mar 23 12:53:25 2015 UTC,It may be the eyeshadow you are using it over. With some of mine I have found a difference. Especially shimmers vs mattes in terms of colour payoff for the eyeliner
AustralianMakeup,2zzspn,Artemisian11,1 point,Mon Mar 23 21:15:51 2015 UTC,"Usually none - I get eczema around my eyes sometimes, so I prefer to avoid irritation as much as possible and stick to cats eye liner."
AustralianMakeup,2zzspn,WarlockPanda,1 point,Mon Mar 23 21:19:49 2015 UTC,Do you use eye primer then? It may help. Also maybe a base eyeshadow to give it something to cling to. That's about all I can think of in terms of troubleshooting eyeliner.
AustralianMakeup,2zzspn,Artemisian11,1 point,Mon Mar 23 21:22:03 2015 UTC,"Not for eyeliner alone, that might be worth a shot. Still though, every other one I have goes on so easily in comparison!"

AustralianMakeup,2zzspn,DreamTrails,1 point,Mon Mar 23 11:20:43 2015 UTC,"With the concealers, which one do I want? I can never figure it out because it seems their shades are mixed as opposed to light --> dark."
AustralianMakeup,2zzspn,missb00,1 point,Mon Mar 23 13:59:20 2015 UTC,Well for me I get both fair and light because light is a colour match for me and I use fair under my eyes and to highlight (it's lighter than light).  It depends on your skin tone.  Light shades   Fair has a pink undertone Light has a yellow undertone   Medium shades   Sand is peachy Medium is darker than sand and a little peachy   Dark shades   Cafe is pink  Deep is yellow

AustralianMakeup,2zzspn,isiisthebomb,1 point,Tue Mar 24 04:56:34 2015 UTC,"This is my second tube (waterproof version)! It holds a curl really well I have to say, probably because it's quite waxy.  But if your top lashes rub against your bottom eyelid you might get a bit of smudging. I use it on top of other mascaras as a volumiser. It goes super well with the loreal telescopic one."

AustralianMakeup,2zzspn,knn328,1 point,Tue Mar 24 01:40:07 2015 UTC,Chadstone!  Very busy store but it has all the brands which aren't at some stores.
AustralianMakeup,2zzusa,MidnightNation,3,Mon Mar 23 09:28:12 2015 UTC,The Face of Australia primer in the aqua coloured tube worked wonders for me. It's a matte finish product that feels really lovely and silky on the skin. I'm fairly oily/prone to sweating on my face and this held up really well :)
AustralianMakeup,2zzusa,arnoldismyhomeboy,3,Mon Mar 23 10:53:08 2015 UTC,"Rimmel Stay Matte is pretty decent, but it's quite thick and can appear quite cakey (At least on me)  Not in the sale, but I actually LOVE the Chi Chi CC Cream.  I've worn it three times now and am so super impressed with how well it works/applies/lasts!"
AustralianMakeup,2zzusa,jamballdonut,2,Tue Mar 24 04:44:16 2015 UTC,Rimmel is my favourite so far. Kept everything matte and in place all day and well into the evening.

AustralianMakeup,2zzusa,szarkasm,1 point,Tue Mar 24 05:27:09 2015 UTC,Do you think its alright for acne prone skin? My friend broke out because of this. Eh. But if you guys are recommending this then it's worth a try!
AustralianMakeup,2zzusa,fecktopia,1 point,Tue Mar 24 11:55:49 2015 UTC,"Its pretty thick and definitely not the most 'breathable' primer out there, but performs it's task magnificently for me. If you're sensitive to silicones, talc, etc I can see how it would be problematic, so check out the ingredients tab on the Priceline product page. I'm acne prone and it doesn't break me out but we're all different."
AustralianMakeup,2zzusa,Ohmygag,1 point,Tue Mar 24 19:52:40 2015 UTC,I was just thinking about posting this question before I go to price line tomorrow. Do you mind telling why you think the Australis primer is rubbish?
AustralianMakeup,2zzusa,BBQsauceBel,1 point,Mon Mar 23 12:02:32 2015 UTC,I just didnt think that it worked. I found no difference in oil control between me wearing this and me not wearing a primer at all.
AustralianMakeup,2zz3aa,RipperReeta,5,Mon Mar 23 03:15:48 2015 UTC,This is the email I received this morning http://imgur.com/E3M3KPX I'm not sure about sale items but it's definitely only makeup (no skincare or brushes)
AustralianMakeup,2zz3aa,ruthfrank,3,Mon Mar 23 03:25:39 2015 UTC,You rule! Thanks heaps!
AustralianMakeup,2zz3aa,goofygooberrock,2,Mon Mar 23 03:34:48 2015 UTC,Is the sale just for sister club members or everyone?
AustralianMakeup,2zz3aa,bam-bino-69,5,Mon Mar 23 03:27:40 2015 UTC,Sale is for everyone :)
AustralianMakeup,2zz3aa,goofygooberrock,2,Mon Mar 23 03:33:43 2015 UTC,Woohoo!
AustralianMakeup,2zz3aa,spooknat,2,Mon Mar 23 06:59:59 2015 UTC,Thanks for posting the advert - I spy with my little eye a bottle of sally hansen in the photo so I'm guessing nail polish is included in the sale. This is exciting :D I plan on getting some of the new Essie Fall collection along with my makeup splurge.
AustralianMakeup,2zz3aa,jamballdonut,7,Mon Mar 23 07:12:40 2015 UTC,"So, pretty much it's just cosmetics (no skincare, haircare, eyelashes, accessories, etc.) and it does include some brushes (if it's the same as every other time).  The brushes generally included are ones that go along with brands (Model's Prefer and Nude by Nature) and NOT any standalone ones (Revlon accessories, Real Techniques, Ecotools, etc.)  That's how it's been every other time, so I assume it'll be the same this time."
AustralianMakeup,2zz3aa,superfembot77,3,Mon Mar 23 06:31:01 2015 UTC,"Dang, was hoping to try some RT brushes"
AustralianMakeup,2zz3aa,szarkasm,2,Mon Mar 23 06:45:12 2015 UTC,You can get them off iHerb.com for a lot cheaper than what they sell at Priceline. The shipping is quite reasonable as well. :)

AustralianMakeup,2zz3aa,reddit-g,2,Mon Mar 23 05:10:54 2015 UTC,I am a little bit :/  Does anyone know if Priceline restock everything before massive sales like this?
AustralianMakeup,2zz3aa,criti_biti,2,Mon Mar 23 08:01:38 2015 UTC,"Yesterday Maybelline, L'Oreal, Revlon were being restocked. The sales assistant said a whole bunch of other stuff got restocked last Thursday/Friday but was practically demolished over the weekend."
AustralianMakeup,2zz3aa,reddit-g,2,Mon Mar 23 21:21:43 2015 UTC,That's a bit of a shame… I was hoping to get the bourjois healthy mix foundation but my shade is regularly out of stock at my local Priceline even without a sale! Might just have to pick it up on ASOS.
AustralianMakeup,2zz3aa,FluffyDressingDown,6,Mon Mar 23 21:27:32 2015 UTC,Can I ask for some advice....what are you guys excited to get at this sale? Is there something that's usually a bit $$$ that I should be looking for in particular? I've never been to one but I was just planning to stock up on my go-to mascara & BB cream but that seems boring 😛
AustralianMakeup,2zz3aa,Artemisian11,2,Mon Mar 23 06:10:55 2015 UTC,"As someone who's still pretty new to this whole, I use it as my opportunity to branch out into new things, or stock up on something I might not have much of, eg. lip liners. Plus it's fuuuuuun."

AustralianMakeup,2zz3aa,SEXPILUS,1 point,Mon Mar 23 04:08:52 2015 UTC,"Hmm. From the sounds of it - I highly doubt it. I think lashes would fall in to the accessories department.   Then again - I don't know what the """" means when it says ""40% OFF ALL COSMETICS!"" - That to me suggests some brands are not on sale... but of course they don't mention which brands."
AustralianMakeup,2zz3aa,Lunawinter,0,Mon Mar 23 04:33:03 2015 UTC,I wonder if they class primers as a skincare product only.. unless they count it as both? I want some more primer and some BB cream :( Last skincare sale they included BB creams in it so it may be the same for primer..
AustralianMakeup,2zz3aa,joymm,2,Mon Mar 23 05:52:31 2015 UTC,Primers are included in cosmetics.
AustralianMakeup,2zz3aa,Artemisian11,1 point,Mon Mar 23 06:04:12 2015 UTC,"Sweet, thanks for the reply.  Do you have any idea if BB creams would be too?"

AustralianMakeup,2zzju7,Jessijames,1 point,Mon Mar 23 09:17:39 2015 UTC,Liquid - it seems only selected items are discounted :( sigh
AustralianMakeup,2zzl3f,whereismydragon,3,Mon Mar 23 06:43:33 2015 UTC,It's a different product from the MooGoo one and from baby oil because the Face of Australia oil is an emulsifying oil so it can be rinsed off.   I bought it because I hadn't been able to find an emulsifying oil locally and was sick of paying postage to buy it. I wish I loved it but the packaging is stupid and the product stings my eyes. It was cheap and it does clean my face but I'll be contacting them to give feedback.
AustralianMakeup,2zzl3f,Bubbalooo,2,Mon Mar 23 09:14:52 2015 UTC,The cheapest cleansing oil you're going to find is plain old baby oil. I didn't believe it until I saw /r/SkincareAddiction repping it.
AustralianMakeup,2zzl3f,pootlepower,1 point,Mon Mar 23 07:11:37 2015 UTC,"Oooh. I guess if all I'm doing is removing eye make-up with it, that would be okay."
AustralianMakeup,2zzl3f,pootlepower,2,Mon Mar 23 07:13:35 2015 UTC,"I will never buy another makeup remover, but it's actually really good for OCM (oil cleansing method) too."
AustralianMakeup,2zzl3f,missb00,1 point,Mon Mar 23 07:27:05 2015 UTC,"Baby oil is just mineral oil with added fragrance and sometimes vitamin e too. Not entirely sure how the price compares, but mineral oil is about $6 at coles/woolies near the vitamin and medication stuff."
AustralianMakeup,2zzl3f,pootlepower,2,Mon Mar 23 13:54:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my skin tolerates most fragrance just fine so I went for baby oil. Got coles smartbuy 500ml, I don't recall the exact price but it was $3 something. It lasts forever!"
AustralianMakeup,2zzl3f,missb00,1 point,Mon Mar 23 13:59:44 2015 UTC,"Well, good on you for making a smart choice! I bought the mineral oil as I wanted the least ingredients - longer lists = more potential irritants =["
AustralianMakeup,2zzl3f,pootlepower,1 point,Mon Mar 23 14:02:30 2015 UTC,Still cheaper than some of the branded cleansing oils out there!
AustralianMakeup,2zzlqx,bubble_thrust,14,Mon Mar 23 06:53:38 2015 UTC,"Chadstone! I was there the other day and they are doing major renovations. They post mocked up photos of what's coming on the boards that are up to hide the renovations, and one was unmistakably a Sephora - there was no logo, but that type treatment is very unique."

AustralianMakeup,2zzlqx,mmondgreen,1 point,Mon Mar 23 09:25:01 2015 UTC,Where Borders used to be is all blocked off... the whole walkway down to Target. There's a photo of a Sephora on it!
AustralianMakeup,2zzlqx,Ienjoylongwalks,1 point,Mon Mar 23 11:27:54 2015 UTC,"They've closed the bowling place and movies, it's mostly happening in that corner.   I don't think it'll be done anytime soon though. Target have a new store opening in August and I think that's one of the firsts."
AustralianMakeup,2zzlqx,Jessijames,1 point,Tue Mar 24 02:06:01 2015 UTC,I didn't think there had even been a cinema there in the time I've lived here (about 18 months) - maybe I just don't wander around the side often enough :s
AustralianMakeup,2zzlqx,Ienjoylongwalks,1 point,Tue Mar 24 02:42:07 2015 UTC,Yeah it was pretty tucked away. It's been closed for a while though. Maybe six or so months? I honestly can't remember when they started. They said they're having five international flagship stores added in the new section. Sephora must be one of them.

AustralianMakeup,2zzmee,joymm,1 point,Mon Mar 23 07:03:38 2015 UTC,Disclaimer: I have not tried the Maybelline powder mentioned. BUT powders you could look at are:  L'Oreal Infallible   Australis Fresh n Flawless   Savvy Mineral Pressed  I love a good powder foundation and all of these offer good coverage. The Australis in particular is excellent and can be applied damp for extra coverage. I'm very fond of Savvy at the moment though as I get a better shade match and it's cheap!
AustralianMakeup,2zztrs,seinlait,9,Mon Mar 23 09:10:53 2015 UTC,Okay....?
AustralianMakeup,2zztrs,Jessijames,1 point,Mon Mar 23 10:10:37 2015 UTC,Maybe it doesn't count if u don't use the products you purchase.. And then when ur ban is finished you can use them!
AustralianMakeup,2zvzw8,jamballdonut,2,Sun Mar 22 08:23:48 2015 UTC,"Products used:  Nude By Nature Mineral Face Primer, Chi Chi CC Cream, Rimmel Wake Me Up Concealer, Maybelline Fit Me Concealer, Rimmel Stay Matte Powder.  Eyes:  Urban Decay Primer Potion, Urban Decay Naked Basics palette, ELF Lock and Seal, Urban Decay Electric Palette, Rimmel WonderFull Mascara, Rimmel Scandeleyes ""Nude"" Liner, Anastasia Brow Wiz.  Why do brows always come up so obviously messy on camera, but look fine in real life?! Hahaha  I've owned this palette for almost a year now, and have neeeever used it, so with the release of Urban Decay this week, I figured I'd pull it out and give it a whirl.  This took me around ~10 minutes to do (I was filming it at the same time) and I'm suuuuuper impressed with it!"
AustralianMakeup,2zvzw8,Artemisian11,1 point,Sun Mar 22 08:25:16 2015 UTC,"Really nice colours! Not that I'm an expert, but feedback I'd give is to aim for even width between the two colours - currently the blue is considerably thicker. Also blending between them, rather than just layering over the top.  Great idea though, and bold! I would definitely not be able to pull this off, but looks like it's great with your skin tone."
AustralianMakeup,2zvzw8,Artemisian11,3,Sun Mar 22 13:24:50 2015 UTC,"It was my first time doing it, so I figured there would be little mistakes! Thank you :)"
AustralianMakeup,2zv7qo,bam-bino-69,3,Sun Mar 22 02:16:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your very informative comment, my sister is not much of a makeup wearer so is handy to have some more information on it! Thank you, and am looking forward to sussing out some MUA's for her :)"
AustralianMakeup,2zv7qo,RipperReeta,2,Sun Mar 22 07:24:42 2015 UTC,"I will post a pic of her when she's closer to her wedding date, as she would be interested in a subtle look, thanks so much x"
AustralianMakeup,2zv7qo,Beoskar,8,Sun Mar 22 08:26:45 2015 UTC,"Completely depends. Sorry - I know that's generic and not very much help. But, depends on the quality of makeup artist. + how many trials are required to get it right. Finally how many people the m-up artist is required to do on the day. (Or their 1/2 day rate - depending how they charge)."
AustralianMakeup,2zv7qo,FluffyDressingDown,2,Sun Mar 22 10:30:35 2015 UTC,Thanks didn't even think of how different they could be
AustralianMakeup,2zv7qo,Teacupbunny,7,Sun Mar 22 23:05:36 2015 UTC,Where I am it goes from $60 per person for a freshly graduated student to $150 per person for a very experienced and talented artists. Just get onto google and search artists in your area to see what available.
AustralianMakeup,2zv7qo,despseeksaudrey,2,Sun Mar 22 02:55:41 2015 UTC,"Good idea thanks, least it gives me a rough estimate x"
AustralianMakeup,2zv7qo,amyeh,5,Sun Mar 22 05:30:33 2015 UTC,"Just another point, whatever the quote is you should usually budget around double that because it's always a good idea to have a trial run beforehand. They're usually in the ballpark price of the actual 'day of' makeup but are worth it to ensure there are no bad reactions to the makeup used, to check that bride & mua are on the same page, and so you know exactly what you'll get on the day."
AustralianMakeup,2zv7qo,LMTartistry,3,Sun Mar 22 03:09:14 2015 UTC,"A trial would be good as my sister doesn't wear makeup often and could be allergic or not like something, thanks"
AustralianMakeup,2zv7qo,LMTartistry,3,Sun Mar 22 05:31:10 2015 UTC,"Pretty much everyone has been right on it.  The other thing I would mention is that you said the wedding is in a few years, so allow for CPI or inflation on those prices. I was married 18months ago and paid $90 each for trial and the day of, but a few weeks ago my best friend was married and found it hard to find a decent MUA for less than $100."
AustralianMakeup,2zv7qo,hez_lea,1 point,Sun Mar 22 03:50:14 2015 UTC,"Didn't think of that either, it's crazy how much the prices of things can go up in a couple years!"
AustralianMakeup,2zv21s,Jessijames,2,Sun Mar 22 01:19:35 2015 UTC,"I purchased it from RoseRoseShop at 40% off - I would only re-purchase at that price, but as my username suggests, I am a massive stinge. The product does feel higher quality than Skin79 and Missha, and I need less than a pea-sized drop to cover my whole face (while I no longer have active cystic acne, my skin tone is pretty patchy and...textured). So I find it full coverage, but it feels lighter on the skin than the other popular BB creams. I have one in a black tube and didn't get a colour choice, so it is a touch dark on me, but its not much of an issue because it doesn't take much product to get good coverage. Just my 2 cents!"
AustralianMakeup,2zv21s,stingyasfuck,1 point,Sun Mar 22 03:17:53 2015 UTC,Which one did you enjoy? I have a Dr Jart+ Black Label + BB cream in Light 20ml size (from Sephora) with about 50% left in it. I'd be more than happy to send it your way. I found it oxidised on my skin. My other recommendation would be to try RoseRoseShop or YesStyle when it is on sale if you are looking for one of the other types.
AustralianMakeup,2zv21s,WarlockPanda,1 point,Sun Mar 22 04:28:17 2015 UTC,I enjoy the dis-a-pore one the  most! It's on Luxola for $41 AUD which isn't too bad considering its 50ml
AustralianMakeup,2zv21s,WarlockPanda,1 point,Sun Mar 22 05:08:23 2015 UTC,That seems reasonable. I am not sure I know that particular version of the BB cream though. Good luck with your search.
AustralianMakeup,2zv21s,BBQsauceBel,1 point,Mon Mar 23 00:33:43 2015 UTC,Over at /r/AsianBeauty they have a list on the sidebar with a bunch of recommended sellers and what they charge postage-wise. Well worth a look!
AustralianMakeup,2zv21s,BBQsauceBel,1 point,Mon Mar 23 01:52:58 2015 UTC,"Thank you, are most of those likely to ship to Aus?"
AustralianMakeup,2zvvm6,punkylemon,1 point,Sun Mar 22 07:06:24 2015 UTC,"I only know of the website, but shipping to Australia is around $25 for one lipstick, so you'll want to get quite a few to make it worth it."

AustralianMakeup,2zsm4c,Nikaa,6,Sat Mar 21 10:18:49 2015 UTC,"Have you tried Bourjois Healthy Mix Serum? It has a lightweight feel like Sheer Glow and is very moisturising on the skin. I get mine from Asos for around $19. You might run into the same problem with the shades though.   The other brand that has amazing deep shades and a gorgeous moisturising finish like NARS is Lancome with their Teint Miracle foundation, but it's still $55 :(  I'm sorry I couldn't help more, unfortunately the more foundations I try the more I realise that NARS is actually one of the cheaper decent foundation options on the Australian market right now."
AustralianMakeup,2zsm4c,walkyouhome,2,Sat Mar 21 21:15:26 2015 UTC,BHMX is my holy grail foundation. I don't think I will ever switch. I just get so pumped up when people mention it. Thats all I had to say. Nothing really helpful but yeah. ok sorry.
AustralianMakeup,2zsm4c,mild_party_time,2,Mon Mar 23 08:23:23 2015 UTC,"I'm the darkest Bourjois HMS colour at 57 or Dark (Deep) Beige and I'm a perfect match for Nars Sheer Glow Barcelona (NC35/C6). It just won't match you at Nars SG Macao.   If you don't like the Nude Magique dispensing method but you quite like the product - why not just pour it in to the NARS Macao bottle. Good for fooling the mind, much better for dispensing (assuming you have the pump on it) - and at this weeks Priceline sale - you can get almost 2 for one?!  Edit: Not sure what I did for the down vote - A perfectly reasonable question was asked and a perfectly acceptable suggestion was given. Thanks for being a dick, whoever you are."
AustralianMakeup,2zsm4c,RipperReeta,2,Sun Mar 22 03:06:05 2015 UTC,"It is $50Aud so it's not that much cheaper, but Benefit's Oxygen Wow liquid foundation has been pretty good to me, and has the same very natural/skin like finish that Nars does. Also feels very light on the face. That said, it is nowhere near as long lasting as Sheer Glow, even when I use primer."
AustralianMakeup,2zsme5,itwaswonderful,3,Sat Mar 21 10:23:55 2015 UTC,"I haven't, but if you're looking for a good highlighter, I would 100% the Essence Cream to Powder Highlighter.  It's actually amazing, and only costs like $5-6 full price, so if you buy it on Tues/Wed, it'll only be like $3!"
AustralianMakeup,2zsme5,jamballdonut,1 point,Sat Mar 21 10:38:04 2015 UTC,Wow I just read some reviews for this and it sounds great! I can't find it on the Priceline website - did you buy yours at Priceline?
AustralianMakeup,2zsme5,jamballdonut,1 point,Sat Mar 21 10:57:23 2015 UTC,"Sure did! It's a sort-of new release though (It came out in like February), and Priceline are soooooo slow with updating new products (ESPECIALLY Essence), so that's why it wouldn't be on the site."

AustralianMakeup,2zsme5,backwards01,2,Sun Mar 22 04:08:05 2015 UTC,I swear by the models prefer mineral highlighter in photo finish. They have 3 or 4 colours. I am dead pale and use it to lightly set my makeup and use it to highlight when applied a bit heavily.

AustralianMakeup,2zsd68,sarkata,2,Sat Mar 21 07:57:27 2015 UTC,I've never tried Rimmel Stay Matte but I really like the L'Oreal Infallible 24hr Stay Fresh Foundation because it has more shades with yellow undertones. I've heard that a lot of Rimmel foundations have pink undertones.
AustralianMakeup,2zsd68,Hinky-punk,1 point,Sat Mar 21 09:01:20 2015 UTC,I was thinking of trying infallible but not really sure whether I'm yellow or pink undertone??
AustralianMakeup,2zsd68,jamballdonut,2,Sun Mar 22 02:21:50 2015 UTC,"I quite like the Rimmel Lasting Finish for medium-full coverage, and it's one of the few fuller coverage foundations I can use without it looking mask like or strangely settling on the skin (my other favourites, but that I find I need to apply with a foundation sponge to get a less weird finish, are Covergirl Outlast 3-in-1 and Revlon Colorstay)."

Blends really well, and the colour selection is pretty decent too.  Rimmel Stay Matte would also make my vote, but it's a LOT thicker, and quite difficult to blend out.  It also just looks sort of cakey, and more ""mask-like"" on me."

AustralianMakeup,2zsd68,puffandruffle,1 point,Sun Mar 22 01:52:53 2015 UTC,"I'm sure i'm in the minority -  but I LOVE the new Revlon Airbrush Photoready Colorstay.

AustralianMakeup,2zog94,disorderedmind,1 point,Fri Mar 20 13:38:41 2015 UTC,"I used these same kind of palette, they are great."
AustralianMakeup,2zog94,ailee612,1 point,Fri Mar 20 14:08:15 2015 UTC,I would lovee an in-depth rundown if you have one :O  They look amazing!
AustralianMakeup,2zog94,disorderedmind,5,Fri Mar 20 08:31:18 2015 UTC,"Sure thing!  First off, here is what I used;   Empty Palette Isopropyl Alcohol/Rubbing Alcohol MAC Fix+ for the binder which helps it actually stick together once it's dried but you can use Bio oil, fractioned coconut oil, or vegetable glycerine instead. I just had the Fix+ handy and vaguely remembered reading people using it for a binder (it contains glycerine) Spatula, this is the one I have Toothpicks Paper/kitchen towel Something hard that fits into the pan, for these ones a 10c coin was a few mm too small but I luckily had a cap from a plastic water bottle floating around that fit perfectly!   I first of all sanitized the palette and let it sit before I began, washed my hands etc. Once I was ready, (prepare to get very very dirty so don't wear nice clothes or do this near white carpet or anything haha) I laid all the pans out and chose which shadows I was going to press.   I did the pans one at a time, gently sprayed a few pumps of the Fix+ into the bottom of the pan, enough to only barely cover the bottom of the pan but you can experiment with the amount of whichever binder you use. Then I put a few drops of the alcohol onto that.   Gently scoop out the powder from the little baggie with your spatula (or scoop of choice, our you can try to pour it out but you will likely lose product and it's messier!) and tap it into the pan until it's all in there then put in a bit more alcohol to help you mix it.   Grab a toothpick and very gently start to mix it all together, I often read the consistency of 'wet sand' is what you're looking for but I found it was easier to add a few drops of extra alcohol to make it a little wetter helped and shouldn't effect it as it will evaporate anyway!   Give it a good mix, then pick it up and gently tap it onto the bench to help smooth it out and set it aside. Move on to the next few and set them aside, or you can do them all then press them later rather than as you go.  Leave them to sit for probably at least 20-30 minutes or so, you'll notice the surface change from looking wet & shiny to a little bit drier. You can gently test them with the tip of your finger or the toothpick, you don't want it to really be 'wet' when you press it. It will still feel damp, but you'll be able to touch it without your finger really sinking into it at all. Some pans took longer to get to this point, some took less. Just keep an eye on them as you're going!  Once they were ready to press, I got a double layer of the paper towel and laid it over the top. Got my bottle cap and pressed it down gently for the first one to get the majority of the moisture out then did it another 1-2 times pressing harder each time until your towel is no longer sucking moisture out of the product (or, very little). Then set them aside to properly dry for a few hours (I left mine overnight) and you're done! I had one or two of my early ones dry and crumble but I started using more Fix+ in the rest (I only used 2-3 drops at first) so I guess they just needed more binder to hold together better. I re-did those ones and they've turned out perfect now!  Another great thing, is the round Shiro labels are the same size as the pans so I just pulled them off the bags and stuck them on the bottom of the pans so I know which is which :)"
AustralianMakeup,2zog94,pyjamasquid,1 point,Fri Mar 20 10:32:05 2015 UTC,"I didn't think of using a bottle top, great idea. I used a coin wrapped in fabric, also I used jojoba oil as the binder but otherwise did the same as you and it was certainly easier once I started using more alcohol so it was wetter to mix it more easily. This is the result - the darkest one shows what happens when you press before it has dried enough."
AustralianMakeup,2zog94,pyjamasquid,1 point,Fri Mar 20 14:19:53 2015 UTC,"Did you use a preservative? I'm not sure if you're already aware of this, but some people encountered mould issues when pressing with glycerin. I did, and unfortunately I ended up having to toss one of my Shiro palettes. I did press another one with jojoba oil, though, and I haven't had problems with that one so far!"
AustralianMakeup,2zog94,peachfloyd,1 point,Sat Mar 21 02:50:48 2015 UTC,"I didn't this time around as I tossed my bottle of preservative when I moved house a few months ago (I used to make body lotions and scrubs etc) but I'm aware some have had this issue. To be honest, for the price it cost it doesn't bother me at all if they develop mould I would just toss the pan/s if they did but it's definitely something to keep in mind! Although, I haven't looked closely enough at the Fix+ ingredient listing but that may have a form of preservative already in it which would help!"
AustralianMakeup,2zog94,smilingsunbeams,1 point,Sat Mar 21 03:52:52 2015 UTC,"Ah, I've never used Fix+ so I don't know much about it! All good, I'm glad you already knew about the moulding issue :) I hope you might be lucky, too, my palette lasted almost a year before it developed mould and I think it was due to weather/humidity more than anything else, so you're probably okay!"
AustralianMakeup,2zog94,smilingsunbeams,1 point,Tue Mar 24 01:57:20 2015 UTC,I've had one of these palettes on my eBay watch list for a while now. Too scared the quality would be awful to buy it. But after seeing this post I think I'm going to get it. Desperately need to press my shiro shadows. And I would also love a more in depth post about how you did it
AustralianMakeup,2zog94,smilingsunbeams,1 point,Fri Mar 20 08:59:37 2015 UTC,Here you go :) I was worried about the quality - I bought one about 18 months ago and when it arrived it wasn't magnetic so the pans were loose and it was a really cheap feeling palette I threw away and never used. This is 100x better! It's probably easily as sturdy as the Australis palette too.  http://www.reddit.com/r/AustralianMakeup/comments/2zog94/i_pressed_some_of_my_shiro_samples_and_im_over/cpkv73k
AustralianMakeup,2zog94,misosoup122,1 point,Fri Mar 20 10:33:41 2015 UTC,I'm a bit late but for anyone interested in pressing you can also use lube as your binder! I made a blog post about it which kinda outlined all the steps but my shadows were so buttery soft and also looked beautiful after pressing!  PS /u/Jessijames thank you so much for the palette link!

AustralianMakeup,2zog94,enthaising,1 point,Sat Mar 21 02:43:49 2015 UTC,Yes haha! I was kinda weirded out at first but it worked so well I'm sold. Plus it's really cheap considering you're using a few drops at a time? I don't know how much Fix+ is but when I compared to the price + shipping for TKB's pressing medium it's crazy how much cheaper it is and it's the same ingredients :)

AustralianMakeup,2zno9k,GemmaMBrooks,2,Fri Mar 20 02:21:09 2015 UTC,I've never seen most of these products before and I've bought Nyx in the states... Are these made for a different market? The branding is a little different to the stuff we get here too...  Edit : looks like they're sourced from the Asian market as these look like the long lip pencils from ozsale and not like ours at all http://makeupandbeauty.com/nyx-long-pencil-lips-prune-expresso-review/
AustralianMakeup,2zno9k,free_from_satan,2,Fri Mar 20 13:53:31 2015 UTC,"It says the prices are based on EU RRP, so maybe that's it? Some of the stuff I recognise from Cherry Culture which is a US site, but you're right, some of it is different. Could also be very old stock? I've never bought from OzSale before so I don't know how trustworthy it is."
AustralianMakeup,2zno9k,xenomorphic_acid,2,Fri Mar 20 14:00:21 2015 UTC,I found some blogs with similar labels to the lipsticks (with the curly brackets) and they changed the labels from that one in 2013 in Malaysia... I think this might be old Malaysian stock...

AustralianMakeup,2zkkp7,nixedreamer,3,Fri Mar 20 05:07:22 2015 UTC,"Wait, how much do they usually charge for Missha BB creams? I get mine from Beautynetkorea and they're $15 all the time. That site looks like they've inflated the price HUGELY to start with ><"
AustralianMakeup,2zkkp7,fetishiste,1 point,Thu Mar 19 16:39:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah - I know...I usually buy mine OS too, but with Australia tax it's $32.50 usually.   This is $16 - and arrives in a few days. No 4-6 week wait.  But the Treatment Essence (travel size) is still cheaper than OS atm. Plus OS matching prices on cleansers etc.   Edit: On second glance - I just checked Beautynetkorea and the Missha BB Cream IS $15 - but $15 USD - which makes it $20AUD at the moment. Plus you have to wait for shipping - so still  much better deal!"

AustralianMakeup,2zkseo,peachfloyd,1 point,Thu Mar 19 12:52:17 2015 UTC,Does it crease? My biggest problem is creasing and caking and being too powdery. Ugh -.-
AustralianMakeup,2zkseo,BlueRainstorm,0,Thu Mar 26 09:25:35 2015 UTC,Doesn't crease at all. I used to never wear eyeshadow primer and my eyeshadow would last like an hour. But this thing is amazing. It lasts all day. Only thing is I've noticed is super glittery eyeshadows don't last as well. So for those I use too faced glitter glue primer
AustralianMakeup,2zkseo,peachfloyd,1 point,Thu Mar 26 23:14:58 2015 UTC,I really meant for under the eye. Creasing under my eye is the biggest issue I have with my makeup. How does it last there for you? :(

I'm currently using an e.l.f. one I got from Kmart, but I've also used MAC's Fix+, plus I'm pretty sure NYX have a popular one at Target. Priceline would surely have one, and Mecca would have several options.   As for eye primer, not sure. I think I'm finally ready to put the final nail in the coffin on UDPP. I just can't get on board with it. Makes my eyes look so powdery and awful. I think I'm going to try MAC Paint Pot in Painterly next. I've got Constructivist and I love it, so I'm willing to give it a go."

It works so much better on my oily lids than the urban decay primer potion and the too faced shadow insurance. You can get the balm eye primer from David Jones (where I got mine), asos and adore beauty. I think it costs about $28?  As for setting spray, I've read good reviews on skindinavia but have yet to try it. I've tried the nyx dewy setting spray and Mac's fix + and they're just ok. They don't really prolong the wear of my foundation."

AustralianMakeup,2zjdib,Sleiphy,0,Thu Mar 19 02:22:43 2015 UTC,I also have Vice 3 and I really love it - some of the darker colours are a little patchy (the blue ones) but it's a really nice palette. The neutrals are great for making the colours work for a toned down everyday look. I'd seriously recommend it - I would take my Vice 3 over my naked palettes when travelling.

AustralianMakeup,2zjdib,Sleiphy,3,Thu Mar 19 02:24:55 2015 UTC,"I have it already and I was a little disappointed with the eyeshadows - they're all a bit same-y so you're limited. If you have the naked palettes I really wouldn't bother. The bronzer also doesn't work on my skin tone. The gloss, mascara, blushes and highlight are good though. Overall possibly worth it if you are inclined to only bring one makeup piece instead of multiple options. I think they're using the excitement and hype to clear a not so great UD palette."
AustralianMakeup,2zjdib,continuousline,0,Thu Mar 19 05:07:23 2015 UTC,May I ask what skin tone you have/ what the bronzer is like? I haven't gotten anything from urban decay before and I am considering getting this as an all around starter kit!

AustralianMakeup,2zj15n,katelynrose25,6,Wed Mar 18 23:46:39 2015 UTC,"I think it depends what you want the primer for. Do you want more minimisation and smoothness or mattifying? Lumination or all day wear.   I love Rimmel Stay Matte for... well staying matte. But for smoothing out are pore minimisation, I really like the Maybelline Instant Age Rewind.   For Lumination, I LOVE the L'Oreal Lumi Magique.  And finally, the undisputed best, nothing will budge on these bastards eyelid primer is Etude House Proof 10. I have very oily lids and this is the ONLY thing that works. UD is terrible by comparison - and  Proof 10 is only 8 bucks to boot!! I use Proof 10 for under eyes and any oily prone areas on SUPER hot summer days. Nothing will budge.   It's the tits."

AustralianMakeup,2zj2uw,Tough_Princess,4,Thu Mar 19 04:19:45 2015 UTC,I have 900 saying they are going to Joondalup. So sad I considered going but then I realised I have a 6month old that doesn't yet understand how important this is for me.

AustralianMakeup,2zfzcz,missbo,20,Wed Mar 18 06:48:20 2015 UTC,"God bella box is awful. I had it for like a year didn't touch any of it really never got any of the ""good"" items ever. I kept giving the chance and it just got worse; no I don't need ANOTHER sample of Pantene and aveeno.   I ended up giving most of the boxes to my sister in law that is a counsellor at a teenage rehab centre that is very isolated in the country. They aren't given any ""luxury"" items even shampoo etc and they wash in bore water, this helps them feel a bit more normal as they try and rehabilitate.   So I mean all those samples that fustrated me put a smile on some teenage girls faces which is nice."
AustralianMakeup,2zfzcz,Tough_Princess,8,Wed Mar 18 07:22:51 2015 UTC,"Argh, I know what you mean.  People would post these boxes that had a couple of awesome pieces in there but somehow I never found the same combo in my box or if I did happen to get a good item, it was in a mis-matched or undesirable colour.    I never received anything from any of the appealing brand partners either like The Balm, Benefit, Anastasia BH, L'Occitane etc, not even any of the cheaper ones like Australis or FoA.  After I unsubscribed, I kept seeing boxes that people would get with some pretty awesome pieces in there and be tempted to resub but it's just not worth it.  Gosh,  I could probably write a novella on my grievances with Bella Box :P"
AustralianMakeup,2zfzcz,Flippantry,8,Wed Mar 18 09:04:23 2015 UTC,I'm pretty positive that the better/nice stuff goes to bloggers so they get publicity and don't bad mouth the box. I rarely saw a blogger get a shit box like I got.   What about what I refer to as benefit-gate last year or something? they publicised benefit like crazy and only put it in a few boxes and then back tracked like crazy because not everyone got it. That was shady as.  I'm subscribed to a few you tubers and America has so many awesome subscription services and boxes and I have an Australian blogger who gets the 3 typical Australian boxes and they are awful in comparison.  Like I get that we have cost issues with makeup which I understand but don't sell your box as something it isn't.
AustralianMakeup,2zfzcz,Tough_Princess,6,Wed Mar 18 09:29:15 2015 UTC,"Can we both be the authors? I won't forget how I complained that my box arrived all smashed inside with every product unusable, then I told customer service and explained that EVERY item was damaged and I had to fill out a survey that only let me choose one item as being destroyed therefore they only sent me one item, I complained again and said screw your survey for not working I verbally told you all my items were damaged then they apologised again and what did they do? SENT ME ONE ITEM AGAIN!"

AustralianMakeup,2zfzcz,lush1984,2,Wed Mar 18 08:23:55 2015 UTC,"The parcel is the only one that actually looks good, but I plan on seeing if their quality stays the same."
AustralianMakeup,2zfzcz,lush1984,2,Wed Mar 18 09:31:03 2015 UTC,"The last parcel (autumn) which I received last week was my first and I was pleasantly surprised. I signed up to a yearly subscription after seeing the awesome stuff in previous parcels on youtube/blogs. Everyone does get the same things in the parcel (only thing is you might get differing scents for soap, handcream etc) . Keep in mind, they are not monthly. They send out every quarterly so only four in a year. Time's a wasting... you could have the pretty things sooner... :p hehe"
AustralianMakeup,2zfzcz,Tough_Princess,1 point,Wed Mar 18 10:31:16 2015 UTC,Haha maybe. If they start putting brushes and primers in I will cave
AustralianMakeup,2zfzcz,missb00,5,Wed Mar 18 10:55:45 2015 UTC,Violet box is really nice but you have to wait a fair while to get it.
AustralianMakeup,2zfzcz,Tough_Princess,4,Wed Mar 18 08:47:11 2015 UTC,"At least you'd get some decent products. Every month I get an email from Bella Box saying ""we're working hard to get your box packed and on its way"" or ""this month we don't have any blue boxes to package your shit in""."
AustralianMakeup,2zfzcz,Tough_Princess,1 point,Wed Mar 18 09:04:46 2015 UTC,Yeah I had bellabox for 2 years but couldn't stand the same repeats of samples.
AustralianMakeup,2zfzcz,missb00,1 point,Wed Mar 18 13:15:35 2015 UTC,Except if you're with commonwealth bank then no box for you lol
AustralianMakeup,2zfzcz,Tough_Princess,2,Wed Mar 18 09:31:37 2015 UTC,Whats the story there?
AustralianMakeup,2zfzcz,missb00,2,Wed Mar 18 11:51:26 2015 UTC,For some reason they can't direct debit commonwealth bank because it comes up as a scam or something. I'm not sure if that is accurate but basically if you use commonwealth bank account commonwealth bank flags the payment and doesn't process it. I think they mentioned it on their Facebook or their website. I'm being very vague I'm sorry.
AustralianMakeup,2zfzcz,Tough_Princess,2,Wed Mar 18 12:06:15 2015 UTC,Do you blame CommBank? Bella Box pretty much is a scam!
AustralianMakeup,2zfzcz,missb00,2,Thu Mar 19 04:27:56 2015 UTC,"Haha nah commonwealth bank is great they look after you, well in my opinion my husband isn't a fan so we still have separate bank accounts.  my mum had her card scammed after buying stuff online at dusk and they sorted it in 5mins. I contacted dusk saying what happened and I could link it to their secure payment company and they were like no idea what you are talking about thanks bye"
AustralianMakeup,2zfzcz,Tough_Princess,1 point,Thu Mar 19 04:31:43 2015 UTC,"Oh, that's pretty strange. Are there other payment options?"
AustralianMakeup,2zfzcz,lush1984,1 point,Wed Mar 18 12:09:16 2015 UTC,"Every other bank payment is fine, I don't think they do PayPal or same problem happens if you are with commonwealth and go through PayPal. It's very strange but I feel commonwealth must have a good reason to do this because no other subscription service is affected."
AustralianMakeup,2zfzcz,Tough_Princess,1 point,Wed Mar 18 12:14:49 2015 UTC,"Well it's a bit of a pity, cause I have no qualms with the Commonwealth. Oh well, more money for me I guess?"
AustralianMakeup,2zfzcz,ComingUpMilhouse,1 point,Wed Mar 18 12:40:40 2015 UTC,Well everyone seems to be like the parcel by Marie Claire so if you are tempted :)

AustralianMakeup,2zfzcz,ComingUpMilhouse,1 point,Thu Mar 19 00:19:54 2015 UTC,Really? How so? Does violet box not like CBA?
AustralianMakeup,2zfzcz,ComingUpMilhouse,1 point,Wed Mar 18 13:14:20 2015 UTC,More CBA doesn't trust violet box and marks it as a scam so maybe they have issues before or something
AustralianMakeup,2zfzcz,onehungrydinosaur,3,Thu Mar 19 00:18:18 2015 UTC,"Is anyone else doing The Parcel, I'm currently considering it."
AustralianMakeup,2zfzcz,Tough_Princess,3,Wed Mar 18 08:50:42 2015 UTC,I'm a big fan of The Parcel - here's my latest unboxing... Even though I'm supposed to remind you you're on a no buy!  http://youtu.be/BOXqIAjeoCM
AustralianMakeup,2zfzcz,ComingUpMilhouse,2,Wed Mar 18 11:48:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah... a friend of mine said the same thing about the no-buy, heh."
AustralianMakeup,2zfzcz,Tough_Princess,2,Wed Mar 18 12:11:52 2015 UTC,Multiple BB cream things bothers me because I wouldn't use either of them. I love a good hand cream so I'm happy to hoard them. The mascara is okay because they have a short shelf life. I don't like to throw random face stuff on my face because a good face product is really about prolonged usage and I get that you can like a sample and continue using it but isn't the point of beauty boxes to get all kinds of stuff? Also cheers for linking the unboxing video.
AustralianMakeup,2zfzcz,keats84,1 point,Wed Mar 18 12:20:37 2015 UTC,"I am watching your Violet Box video after and I'm not taken by that box either. Random skincare, no thank you and physical exfoliators are not friendly."
AustralianMakeup,2zfzcz,spooknat,1 point,Wed Mar 18 12:26:50 2015 UTC,MESSY! Love your videos!
AustralianMakeup,2zfzcz,trombophony,2,Thu Mar 19 03:38:41 2015 UTC,I think (could be wrong) everyone gets the exact same things in the parcel so you could look at unboxings on YouTube
AustralianMakeup,2zfzcz,score1fortheprincess,2,Wed Mar 18 09:32:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah very true, thanks. I am thinking that I should stick with my usual decision in that I have no need for most of the stuff so I'm better off buying things I actually want. It is very tempting though."
AustralianMakeup,2zfzcz,gluckenspork,2,Wed Mar 18 09:35:24 2015 UTC,"Lol yeah I worked that out with bellabox. I already have everything I want and after three they obviously did not deliver on ""introducing me to exciting new products"". No you had someone go to coles and a sample warehouse and not a good one to make my box."
AustralianMakeup,2zfzcz,faithlessdisciple,1 point,Wed Mar 18 09:41:30 2015 UTC,"I just started the parcel and found it to be way better than bella box samples. I got the Autumn box, last week and wouldn't look back to bella box at all. Definitely try the parcel, if you are looking for a decent beauty box with a high end product or two in the samples. I have no regrets with my subscription."

Also the powder and concealer under the same name :)   Edit: There's also the Max Factor creme puff pressed powder and blush that just got released. The blushes look like they could be dupes for the Hourglass ambient lighting blushes!

AustralianMakeup,2zg6jw,Jessijames,2,Wed Mar 18 09:40:12 2015 UTC,"I swatched the blushes in priceline the other day, they seemed much more pigmented than the hourglass blushes - not that the hourglass ones aren't very pigmented, the colours in the creme puff are just much deeper/stronger colours, not as subtle as the ALB 's  :-)"
AustralianMakeup,2zg6jw,Artemisian11,1 point,Wed Mar 18 10:38:29 2015 UTC,"Oooh, do you think they're like the Milani baked blushes? :D"
AustralianMakeup,2zg6jw,Jessijames,2,Wed Mar 18 10:50:47 2015 UTC,"Not as glittery as the milani - these are definitely more 'glowy' than glitter! And also much softer, I found the milani nice but very hard baked - these were much softer :-)"

AustralianMakeup,2zgi66,akiraahhh,7,Wed Mar 18 11:50:22 2015 UTC,"Hey there! I've got super straight Asian lashes too so I understand your struggle haha :(. I've done heaps of research on this topic and my lashes seem to hold a curl pretty well during a day so I hope I can help you with this :))  First of all, it's good to invest in a good eyelash curler. Shu Uemura or Shiseido seem to be the best for Asian eye shapes, so though $37 or $25 might seem pretty steep, it's a good investment. I use the SU one and it's lasted for over two years without needing to replace the rubber pads. Also, if you do buy the Shiseido one, make sure you get the Japanese one, instead of the Western one. The Western one tends to clip the edges of my eyes, but the Japanese one is fine (my sister owns both). When you curl your lashes, make sure you curl them in a three step process, from the roots to the ends of your lashes, and once again at the roots.   Secondly, as for mascaras, make sure that you get a waterproof mascara that has a dry formula. Non-waterproof mascaras tend to be too heavy and weigh down your lashes, making the curl go down during the day. My favourite right now is Maybelline's Cat Eyes Waterproof mascara, because of its thin, curved, plastic wand and its very dry formula. It holds the curl very well all day for me. If you want to invest in a good mascara, it's better off to go for Japanese brand mascaras, as they're aimed for Asian lashes. Heroine make and Majolica Majorca are ones that I've heard great reviews from.   Thirdly, you should use an oil and water based eye make up remover (those ones that are like half water half oil), or a specific mascara remover (Asian beauty brands sell heaps of these). Most people dislike the feeling of oil on their face, but it removes mascara really really well. Shake the bottle well, and soak two cotton pads in it and leave it on your eyelashes for five seconds, then start to remove the mascara. It'll come off in a breeze and you won't need to do any scratching :)  Wow I ended up typing heapssssss but I hope this helps!!!"
AustralianMakeup,2zgi66,desarcinate,1 point,Wed Mar 18 13:40:48 2015 UTC,Seconding the Maybelline cat eyes waterproof mascara - it's definitely my favourite too.
AustralianMakeup,2zgi66,Sleiphy,1 point,Wed Mar 18 23:15:48 2015 UTC,I own maybelline cat eyes and a  heroine make mascara. Both are super waterproof but they hold a curl like no other and they give me amazing length! A good wand and a thinner style brush also helps. I find big brushes smear to easily and I don't have long enough eyelashes for them.  Also backing up on an oil and water based remover. I'm using cyber colours gentle eye make up remover but I've also used clinique gentle eye and lip remover. Both of them work on waterproof lashes but I prefer the clinique (seems to work quicker in removing).
AustralianMakeup,2zgi66,ehcn,2,Thu Mar 19 10:46:50 2015 UTC,"My mum has the same kind of eyelashes. I put her on to Benefits They're Real Mascara. It's great but an absolute bitch to get off. I don't know if there's a non-waterproof version that will come off easier.   I also used Sephoras mascara. I don't know if the Sydney Sephora stocks it though - I don't live in Sydney and I bought it overseas. But that makes your eyelashes great, and it comes off really easy."
AustralianMakeup,2zgi66,countrypeach,2,Wed Mar 18 23:33:17 2015 UTC,I found the Maybelline full and soft waterproof mascara great for holding a curl but I didn't like how it tended to smudge under my eyes. The covergirl clump crusher extensions (the non waterproof one) did an okay job at holding a curl but I love it more than the Maybelline as it doesn't smudge at all and is pretty easy to take off at the end of the day.
AustralianMakeup,2zgi66,Joolebear,1 point,Thu Mar 19 03:22:37 2015 UTC,Thanks everyone! I already use a oil/water remover and sometimes straight-up oil but Covergirl Lash Blast Waterproof is still not coming off. I guess I'll be checking out all of your waterproof recs! :)

AustralianMakeup,2zbhoh,blackgirldownunder,2,Wed Mar 18 22:11:06 2015 UTC,"I'm closer to nc50, but we're probably out of luck with anything drugstore priced in Australia. I know that Maybelline has discontinued a bunch of darker shades from a couple of lines and most of the other brands simply don't go dark enough."
AustralianMakeup,2zbhoh,pinkertongeranium,1 point,Tue Mar 17 08:08:59 2015 UTC,Yeah I have found a lot online but hesitant to buy as I haven't tried. Such a pain. Thanks for the reply xo
AustralianMakeup,2zbhoh,ncln,2,Wed Mar 18 22:11:54 2015 UTC,"the Maybelline fit me (normal, not matte + poreless version) still has darker shades at places like Cosmetics Plus and discount pharmacies, i snagged the shade 320 which is too dark for me but it was like $6 so i thought i'd grab it and experiment. failing that, Amazon has US pricing for a lot of drugstore makeup, so everything is between 5 and 10 dollars max, so i'm planning on buying a bunch of foundations and some books. shipping of a big order like i'm planning is about 20$AU which i think is still reasonable considering i'd spend that on ONE 'drugstore' foundation here"
AustralianMakeup,2zbhoh,pinkertongeranium,2,Tue Mar 17 09:05:35 2015 UTC,"thanks! i will have a look, for those prices im happy to buy a few colours and hopefully one will work!"
AustralianMakeup,2zbhoh,ncln,1 point,Wed Mar 18 22:13:27 2015 UTC,Yah Maybelline Fit Me for sure. Im NC40 and fit me 220 (I think!) Is a great colour match. I know there are darker shades as well but I haven't paid much attention to how dark they go.
AustralianMakeup,2zbhoh,blackgirldownunder,1 point,Tue Mar 17 11:02:36 2015 UTC,"Do you find 220 too pink? In the bottle it didnt look like it would suit me so opted out, they didnt have a tester in that shade available"
AustralianMakeup,2zbhoh,Nikaa,2,Tue Mar 17 12:09:59 2015 UTC,To be honest I dont find it pink at all! I have neutral leaning on yellow undertones and find its a really good match. I did see big w had 30% off maybelline this weekend gone- dont know if that offer is still on! Otherwise hold out till nexts week 40% priceline sale and you should be able to pick it up for around $12
AustralianMakeup,2zbhoh,Nikaa,1 point,Wed Mar 18 09:03:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I forgot to say this last night! Amazon has a bunch of drugstore foundations (though not all can be shipped here). I've bought most of my cheaper foundations from there since you can't get them here. And you can get $off coupons on some of them."
AustralianMakeup,2zbhoh,rainbowplethora,2,Wed Mar 18 03:37:33 2015 UTC,"Okay, NC43-47ish gal here with what I've found for a reasonable colour match:   Revlon Nearly Naked liquid foundation and pressed powders; there's even one shade darker than the ones that work for me, which are Toast and Deep respectively Maybelline pink BB Cream in Medium/Deep L'Oreal Nude Magique foundation (those liquid ones in the glass bottles) in the darkest shade (I think it's called Golden Sable?) Maybelline Fit Me concealer in Cafe   That's honestly it. If it's within your means, I'd just bite the bullet and dish out twenty more bucks for something like Nars Sheer Glow (Macao has been possibly the best colour match I have ever had ever) that has a nice wide shade selection.     If you're in Sydney, Sephora does seem to carry a better overall shade range in that I'm generally the second or third darkest shade in the selection. But again, that's also higher up there in price. Sephora's in house brand may be worth trying since they have both the shade selection and the comparatively cheaper ~$25 pricetag.    Other than that, you could attempt to get US drugstore stuff from BlueScandal or Amazon but you obviously can't test those. Also the exchange rate sucks at the moment."
AustralianMakeup,2zb2nl,breatheitin,8,Tue Mar 17 02:26:33 2015 UTC,"I have the exact same skin type! I have used Bourjois Healthy Mix Foundation in 51 Light Vanilla for years. Good colour, makes my skin look fresh and slightly dewy - also doesn't cling to my dry bits. I make sure I apply moisturiser a few minutes before I apply foundation to make sure I have a good base. I find that some primers can make the clinging to dry bits worse so I tend to avoid it. As for concealer - Fit Me is my holy grail. I'll also be interested to see other peoples recommendations!"
AustralianMakeup,2zb2nl,chubbybubbys,3,Tue Mar 17 02:59:38 2015 UTC,I'm not fair but I use no. 53 and it makes me look dewy AF.

AustralianMakeup,2zb2nl,Lunawinter,2,Tue Mar 17 05:37:55 2015 UTC,"My local Priceline doesn't have the lightest (51) or darkest (55 & 56) shades, only three middle shades.

AustralianMakeup,2zb2nl,xenomorphic_acid,1 point,Tue Mar 17 08:23:57 2015 UTC,"That's probably what happened, I believe I tried the shade called vanilla actually not light vanilla so it was most likely the lightest shade there but not the lightest shade they make! Thanks :D"

For concealer, Fit Me goes quite pale too (15 is paler than 10 according to one of my friends) but is often quoted as a dupe for NARS Creamy Concealer"
AustralianMakeup,2zb2nl,breviloquent-,3,Tue Mar 17 03:27:30 2015 UTC,"I own both 15 and 10, and they're pretty much the same shade, just fyi, the only difference is that 15 is cool-toned & 10 is warm-toned.  If anything, I find 15 slightly lighter, but that may be because I'm cool-toned and it actually blends into my skin! :)"
AustralianMakeup,2zb2nl,jamballdonut,2,Tue Mar 17 09:50:17 2015 UTC,Yeah my friend has 15 over 10 because she finds it lighter

AustralianMakeup,2zb2nl,jamballdonut,2,Wed Mar 18 04:41:32 2015 UTC,"I like this physicians formula concealer for under my eyes, nose and chin. It's yellow at one end and neutral on the other so you can come up with a nice pale shade. It's got nice coverage and blends out really nicely, especially with a damp sponge. I found this after spending FOREVER in Priceline trying to find a concealer that was a) not super expensive and b) light enough to highlight with. All the usual brands (Maybelline etc) were too dark...The Australis concealer (Go Camo? I think that's it) is the perfect colour (hence why I tried it) but oh. my. god. It is THICK. That shit will cling to anything. So I'd avoid that one.  https://www.priceline.com.au/cosmetics/face/concealer/youthful-wear-cosmeceutical-youth-boosting-dark-circles-corrector-concealer-in-light-and-yellow.-9.0-g"

The 2 palest shades are actually pale enough for vampires like me and comes in both pink and yellow tones. Have also heard good things about L'Oreal True Match Lumi but have yet to try it. For concealer the Maybelline Instant Age Rewind is also pretty good, I'm planning on repurchasing it in the sale."

AustralianMakeup,2zakbd,violetbang,6,Tue Mar 17 01:00:03 2015 UTC,"Don't fully dip your brush in there, just kind of press it against it lightly...like dabbing I guess. You need such a tiny little amount of that product haha  Also, try to warm it first. Even just holding it in your hand while you do something else will make it easier to apply.   Start at the arch and use excess to fill in the inner brow section."
AustralianMakeup,2zakbd,pondicus,4,Tue Mar 17 03:48:11 2015 UTC,Use less than you actually think you need! Start with a teensy dab of product and build as necessary.

I'll probably get 5 or 6 of those as they are only around $2.50 during the sale. Also things like lip liners, of which I have very few and I'll be stocking up on my Models Prefer Eyebrow Pencil (which is AMAAZZZZING!!!).

Hahah :P  I've heard that the Max factor facefinity all day primer is amazing at helping your makeup last so I feel like it's a must-try for combo/oily skin girls like me!

I'm also sort of dying to get Rimmel's lip liner in Eastend Snob but I'll try my best to wait for a 50% off at Chemist Warehouse that'll probably happen sometime throughout the year."

I like to use all their products together but I especially love their mineral powder for my lazy days off.

AustralianMakeup,2z8b3c,australiscosmetics,2,Wed Mar 18 04:36:10 2015 UTC,I got the Smashbox contour kit and I don't really like it. The brown is too...dark? Or something? I have really pale skin too and I feel like it just looks like I have dirt on my face when I wear it. I do musicals though so I'll be saving it for the stage and will try to grab the AC on tour one instead.
AustralianMakeup,2z8b3c,thehumantenniselbow,2,Mon Mar 16 16:37:15 2015 UTC,I'm pale too (NW15) and the AC on Tour kit is perfect for me! I've managed to use ALL the shades (something I did not expect). The top left powder pretty much doubles as regular powder for me rather than a highlight though. I can use all the dark shades (yay!) as long as I use a verrrrry light hand. The bottom right colour is a really lovely crease shade too :)
AustralianMakeup,2z8b3c,thexcheshirexcat,2,Mon Mar 16 22:27:26 2015 UTC,Yeah how many times ive had a dirty looking face when i was learning lol
AustralianMakeup,2z8b3c,missbo,1 point,Tue Mar 17 09:42:02 2015 UTC,I'm very fair most of the time and I always struggle to find a highlighting powder that is lighter than my skin tone. I enjoy the one in the AC palette but if I want something brighter for a heavier look or stronger effect then I recommend Illamasqua's white blush called Intrigue. I either use it on top of my exisiting highlight or mix the powders then apply. I also recently bought a sculpting powder from Inglot in the lightest shade and that works amazing on its own.

AustralianMakeup,2z3sfe,peachfloyd,5,Sun Mar 15 09:27:19 2015 UTC,"Cherryculture is often sold out of it because it's popular, not sure about blue scandal. And it's not discontinued"
AustralianMakeup,2z3sfe,brownbabe,6,Sun Mar 15 11:31:39 2015 UTC,"Personally, I just use grey/brown eye shadows for a similar effect, some of my favs are   chi chi baked eyeshadow in living on a prayer inglot 360 matte the taupe shade in the nyx dream catcher pallet   Sometimes i also use the same grey/ brown eyeliner i use to fill in my brows to contour if im feeling really lazy. If your looking to spend more you could get hollow by illamasqua or mac studio sculpt. I've also heard of people using the maybelline colour tattoo in tough as taupe to contour although i haven't tried it but i like it as an idea :D good luck xx"
AustralianMakeup,2z3sfe,Genetic_Failure,3,Sun Mar 15 09:44:15 2015 UTC,"I spent ages looking for a contour colour that wasn't orange on me. I sucked it up and got illamasqua cream pigment in hollow. Not the cheapest, but I've used it regularly for a year and it's mostly full."
AustralianMakeup,2z3sfe,WarlockPanda,2,Sun Mar 15 12:58:37 2015 UTC,"If you want something you can swatch in store try the Body Shop Honey Bronzer in 01. I think it costs about $30. MAC also has a Taupe blush which can be used as a contour, but it is also fairly expensive. Otherwise I agree with the others, buy NYX taupe online!"
AustralianMakeup,2z3sfe,originalaliswan,2,Sun Mar 15 09:24:58 2015 UTC,The body shop bronzer definitely looks promising! Thank you for the suggestion

AustralianMakeup,2z0dt7,Ienjoylongwalks,3,Sun Mar 15 10:56:40 2015 UTC,"At the doctors today, the only reason I bothered with makeup is because I really wanted to test the covergirl foundation (READY SET GORGEOUS) I picked up in the woolworths sale yesterday (they only had two shades left. 105 and 210).

AustralianMakeup,2z0dt7,Artemisian11,3,Sat Mar 14 14:13:55 2015 UTC,"Oh its fine, it's not private at all. I had a form of dermatitis around my eyes and on my eyelids. It was constantly flakey and red, and some days it would swell up. One day it was so bad that it looked like someone punched me in the face.   So while I was on a cream for it I had to avoid getting anything on the area, make up, lotion, face wash, etc. while it heeled. I saw my dermatologist on Friday and he said i can start wearing make up again, but start with eyeshadow for a few weeks then try mascara. He said eyeshadow isn't much of an irritant but mascara is.   I also MIGHT have face dandruff too, so he gave something for that too. My skin looks and feels fine but as soon as I use a liquid foundation or bb cream, my face looks very flakey, so fingers crossed that this cream works. At the moment I only use powder foundation and sometimes that can look bad too, but not as bad as liquid.   Edit: some words so I make some sense"

AustralianMakeup,2z0dt7,Artemisian11,2,Sun Mar 15 08:21:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah its super weird, perhaps the powder doesnt catch the flakes as much. Glad I'm not the only one who experiences these frustrations."
AustralianMakeup,2z0dt7,Ienjoylongwalks,1 point,Sun Mar 15 11:39:38 2015 UTC,"Definitely not. It's why I just stick with BB cream and liquid eyeliner most days, makes for less sticking to flaking and less irritation."

AustralianMakeup,2z0dt7,missalmg,1 point,Sun Mar 15 01:32:21 2015 UTC,"It's only 7, so nothing yet, but yesterday (and later today) I wore an ASAP CC (got 3 samples from my esthetician yay) , which I can't wear alone as it is waaaay too orangey for me, but under my NYX mineral foundation stick in ""porcelain"" it's perfect. I'm really loving the combo; no need for primer, sunscreen, CC, or bronzer; the ASAP CC takes care of all that. Because the NYX stick is so fair, the CC brings it up to a match for me. (The next shade up was too warm, and hard to bring down to match.) They feel so beautifully silky as well.   I set with Stay Matte powder in ""Transparent"". Currently I use a powder puff to press in, let set for 5 mins while I get dressed, then buff excess off. It's lasting my day at school really well.  Then the rest of my current routine is Tony Moly blush in ... something from last season that I really like so I've been using it all year, curl lashes and the purple maybelline mascara, this lipstick (335 ""Hot date"") from The Body Shop as a bit of a stain, and this brow pencil from Australis in ""Dark Brown"". It's been discontinued now, so I have to find a new one. I'm a bit sad because this one is a perfect match for me and the colour is nice and firm. I've noticed that many of the brow pencils lately are quite soft, and since I'm out in the playground at school in the sun so often, I can get quite sweaty and it sometimes slides off. This Australis pencil never does that, so each time I sharpen it I get a bit sad.   TLDR:   ASAP CC NYX mineral stick foundation ""porcelain"" Stay matte pressed powder ""translucent"" Tony Moly Crystal blush (number 11 I think?) The Body Shop Colour Crush lipstick 335 Maybelline ""The Falsies"" purple mascara Australis brow pencil ""dark brown""   My husband's over the shoulder TLDR: ""Pretty colours"". :)  http://i.imgur.com/NlLhEtF.jpg"

AustralianMakeup,2yvj3k,pumpkinspicevodka,4,Fri Mar 13 05:17:38 2015 UTC,"Thankyou!   As for the wing, the secret is the Revlon liner, it's like an eye pencil but super buttery, I think Chi Chi makes them like that as well! First I applied it on the outer corner of my top lashline, and then I used a teeny tiny angled brush to smudge it into a wing! So much easier than using liquid eyeliner 😂"

AustralianMakeup,2ywzxp,breviloquent-,3,Fri Mar 13 15:08:40 2015 UTC,I don't remember exactly what shipping was for me but I bought 2 of their palettes for my pressed indies and my Makeup Geek eyeshadows. So yeah MUG does fit fine with the polarity.
AustralianMakeup,2ywzxp,WarlockPanda,3,Fri Mar 13 21:10:05 2015 UTC,"Coastal scents does not have great shipping rates. From what I recall the last time I ordered, shipping came out to almost the same price of what I was paying for the items. I didn't feel like it was worth it. The only time I would ever buy from them is when they have their 50% off sale."
AustralianMakeup,2ywzxp,Zapookie,1 point,Sat Mar 14 07:51:01 2015 UTC,"The shipping depends on weight. I bought 56 shadows, two empty 28 palettes and 5 brush shampoos and I think I paid about $36+ for shipping"

AustralianMakeup,2ywzxp,Haibarai,3,Sat Mar 14 04:47:45 2015 UTC,"Pretty decent, actually. Some shades were a bit hit and miss, but I really liked 90% of the shades I own (I now own 3 28 colour palettes, all filled with Hot Pots) if you go to my blog (caitessa.wordpress.com) you can see some swatches of 56 of their shadows next to some MUG shadows (I would've just out the imgur album in but I don't know how to do it on my phone)   As for comparison to MAC, Inglot etc, I've never used any of their shades to be able to judge, whereas I have quite a few MUG shadows, which a lot of them are really comparable, especially when you factor in the price point  Edit: I went on my computer so here it is http://imgur.com/a/QzJsA  Edit 2: I just realised that those have no comparisons, so here's my MUG swatches with comparisons http://imgur.com/a/W4F9d"

AustralianMakeup,2ywzxp,Haibarai,1 point,Sat Mar 14 14:31:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's pretty accurate. When you order them,  though, it says somewhere what kind of finish as well as colour payoff, so they might be ""matte, semi-sheer"". By memory, I think most of their mattes are labelled as semi-sheer, but they are buildable"
AustralianMakeup,2ywzxp,caitlin1993,1 point,Sat Mar 14 19:34:48 2015 UTC,"I bought the Revealed palette, the eclipse concealer palette, the Winterberry palette and some brushes. I paid $20 shipping. Turns out the quality is really chalky and I hated them so sold them all anyway ><"
AustralianMakeup,2ywzxp,nixedreamer,1 point,Fri Mar 13 23:56:31 2015 UTC,"You should for most online stores be able to add everything you're looking at into your cart and there's usually either a shipping calculator on the cart page or go through the checkout phases until it calculates the shipping for you (without completing the order).  IIRC Coastal Scents ship by weight, so there's not really any way to know exactly how much unless you get it calculated :)"
AustralianMakeup,2ywzxp,Jessijames,2,Sat Mar 14 07:21:32 2015 UTC,"for coastal scents, you have to add in all your billing info and credit card details and that kinda irked me so thought i might ask here first."

AustralianMakeup,2ywf2l,pumpkinspicevodka,1 point,Fri Mar 13 11:45:17 2015 UTC,"I don't have much experience with Chi Chi a few years back, but I have a TONNE of experience with them in the last year and they almost always blow me away.  Straying from eyeshadows for a second, their Viva La Diva lipsticks are completely amazing, I prefer them to the (admittedly few) MAC lipsticks I have tried.   Back to eyeshadows, their baked ones are great, I've swatched all of them in store and own one (my cousin also owns one and hers is also amazing). However, my experience of their naked dupe was not very good. That's probably my only complaint about chi chi.  Please, give them another go!"

I'm still on the fence about some of their products but I feel like they stepped up their eyeshadow game at least.  I've got a few of their other palettes (like the Nudes and Rich Gems) and they're pretty good!
AustralianMakeup,2yw94q,jamballdonut,5,Fri Mar 13 09:57:28 2015 UTC,"Sorry, the Velourlips shade is Pa-Ree, not Lun-Dun.  I've just had Lun-Dun on my brain for a while, whoops!"

AustralianMakeup,2yw94q,Tuipie,3,Fri Mar 13 22:54:56 2015 UTC,I have a feeling they are the same supplier/ manufacturer (Heritage Brands). I have the same two and the colour and smell are exactly the same. The sportsgirl one is a little bit of a thicker formulation.
AustralianMakeup,2yw94q,crossesafimelb,1 point,Fri Mar 13 23:52:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm thinking they are! The first thing I noticed was that the smell was identical!"

AustralianMakeup,2yuale,WarlockPanda,5,Thu Mar 12 23:09:19 2015 UTC,I've been meaning to try the smashbox one! Don't waste your money on the Mecca branded green primer though. There's not enough green pigment in there to do anything at all!
AustralianMakeup,2yuale,Jessijames,2,Fri Mar 13 02:40:18 2015 UTC,"It was really great for redness, I would have bought a full size if it hadn't have broken me out!"
AustralianMakeup,2yuale,Tuipie,2,Fri Mar 13 03:11:29 2015 UTC,Buy the travel size before the full size to see if you like it first. I like the Smashbox one but it is not my HG so I will not be repurchasing it. It does nothing for my redness (damn that red-faced Scottish heritage).
AustralianMakeup,2yuale,bam-bino-69,2,Fri Mar 13 04:48:12 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, definitely looking at the travel size!! I really want to try their newer pore filling one. I've heard it's similar to the Becca pore/mattifying primer in terms of texture but slightly better to apply!"

AustralianMakeup,2yrkul,Jessijames,2,Thu Mar 12 05:42:53 2015 UTC,Does anyone know how this compares to Revlon Colourstay?  Definitely keen to try a new (and cheaper) foundation.
AustralianMakeup,2yrkul,sweib,5,Thu Mar 12 09:10:25 2015 UTC,"The finish is different to Revlon CS, it is more matte. I personally don't think it lasts as long as CS but it definitely wears better in that I don't find I look patchy at all like I sometimes do with CS, by the end of the day I don't look exactly like I did in the morning but I definitely still look acceptable.   The brilliant thing for me about the ready set gorgeous foundation is how easily it applies! Seriously it just blends in like a DREAM, I find with CS that I really almost have to tug at it to get it around my face, with the Covergirl I can seriously just rub it between my middle finders and apply it like moisturiser! It has a quite velvety texture, I would almost go as far to say it is the nicest foundation I have ever tried in terms of application."
AustralianMakeup,2yrkul,sunshine16,1 point,Thu Mar 12 09:39:49 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean about CS wearing strangely, it always seems to rub off around my nose/mouth. Guess I'll be heading into Woolies tomorrow!"
AustralianMakeup,2yrkul,sweib,1 point,Thu Mar 12 10:07:04 2015 UTC,I can't agree more about your last comment about application. It applies for me like a dream and leaves a lovely satiny-matte texture! Compared to the CS that is a chore to apply for me as well haha
AustralianMakeup,2yrkul,Jessijames,3,Thu Mar 12 11:44:18 2015 UTC,"I personally don't find Revlon Colourstay lives up to the hype for me. It doesn't control oil dramatically better than many other foundations, nor does it last as long and I struggle to make it look not cakey - this stuff trumps Colourstay for me, I'll not be repurchasing the Revlon when I finish my almost empty bottle that's for sure! This Covergirl I'm already debating getting a backup ha"
AustralianMakeup,2yrkul,Jessijames,1 point,Thu Mar 12 09:29:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not particularly oily so I don't really find that a problem, but I think for $9 I'll definitely be giving it a shot. It's so annoying how revlon is so much more expensive here than in the US"

AustralianMakeup,2yrkul,pumpkinspicevodka,1 point,Thu Mar 12 06:21:44 2015 UTC,"Everything, no seriously. The shade could be a fraction lighter for me but that's negated by the amazingness of the foundation itself. It applies easily and blends easily, doesn't go streaky, doesn't oxidize, stays quite matte throughout the day for me (better than almost every other 'drugstore' foundation I've ever tried and some high end ones!), it's quite high coverage and builds/layers well and still looks quite natural. I just really love it at the moment!!"
AustralianMakeup,2yrkul,Jessijames,1 point,Thu Mar 12 07:15:35 2015 UTC,Does anyone know if it's good for oily skin?

AustralianMakeup,2yrkul,sarkata,1 point,Thu Mar 12 07:24:43 2015 UTC,"I have the Outlast Foundation. Its a matte finish, really good for oily/combo skin. Not so good for the dry skin (sticks on dry patches). Warning it does oxidise,so maybe get a shade lighter (maybe swatch at priceline and wait 20 mins before choosing a shade)."
AustralianMakeup,2yrkul,Jessijames,1 point,Thu Mar 12 09:21:58 2015 UTC,"This doesn't oxidise for me, so it may not on everyone! :-)"
AustralianMakeup,2yrkul,Turinqui,1 point,Thu Mar 12 11:42:21 2015 UTC,Yea it sort of annoying that its inconsistent in that way. But I guess maybe if you swatch you can make sure it doesn't oxidise. Cause I initially bought one and it went 2 shades darker on me :(  But I do like how long it lasts

If you want a high end lipstick, I would recommend Estee Lauder's pure color envy sculpting lipstick in Desirable. It's one of the most comfortable lipsticks I own after 5 hours of wear and has opaque pigmentation and a faint vanilla scent (although it's tasteless)."

AustralianMakeup,2yq9jf,_cephei,2,Wed Mar 11 23:56:45 2015 UTC,"It's not that you 'can't' more that you shouldn't - from what I know, NARS foundations (even the sheer glow/matte) are designed to be applied with fingers. Although the sheer ranges do still apply nicely with a brush, many reviews from bloggers etc tried with a brush and got awful results - eg. application was streaky or patchy and just not very 'blended' into the skin but noted it applied really well when gently rubbed and patten into the skin with their hands. As I said, I used a stippling brush and stippled it on rather than buffed and got an okay application but it looked better with my fingers or a beauty blender!"
AustralianMakeup,2yq9jf,backwards01,1 point,Thu Mar 12 00:15:00 2015 UTC,I use a brush to apply my sheer glow foundation and it's fine. I use a sigma f80 and it's great!
AustralianMakeup,2yq9jf,backwards01,1 point,Thu Mar 12 02:58:11 2015 UTC,"I feel your pain. My friend actually gave me hers as it was too watery for her skin and she had no luck with it after a couple of applications. I didn't really believe her and thought she wasn't applying it properly. It only lasts about an hour on me, the finish is lovely as soon as you apply it but not long lasting at all and i look like a hot mess after it oxidized mere minutes after I applied it. I have tried a few primers with it, plus powder before foundation etc but no luck. There are so many good reviews of this foundation, i'm starting to think they have all been using sheer glow and gotten the name wrong! lol  I'm going to stick to my Sheer Glow (absolutely no cons for me, i love it) and pass on this bottle to someone else. Maybe it will be 3rd time lucky for someone!"

AustralianMakeup,2yq9jf,jaded_elf,1 point,Thu Mar 12 01:49:46 2015 UTC,"Those all sound like silicone primers. I'm not 100% sure if it is a silicone based foundation though. I know it is best to use silicone based foundation with silicone based primers, but there are always few exceptions to rules. Maybe try and find a water based primer? There is a list over on MUA somewhere. Try and get a sample and give it a go?"
AustralianMakeup,2yq9jf,missb00,1 point,Thu Mar 12 02:54:41 2015 UTC,"It is a silicone based foundation, hence the silicone primers - I already checked :) Although the Rimmel Stay Matte is non-silicone IIRC. Neither have made a difference in application around my nose area sadly! I have also tried it with a Mecca 'green' primer which is essentially a glorified moisturiser and is a lightweight cream that sinks in and is water based and if anything it was the worst! Another reason why I am super perplexed that a change in primers hasn't really helped -.-"
AustralianMakeup,2yq9jf,missb00,2,Thu Mar 12 02:57:41 2015 UTC,"The second ingredient in the Stay Matte ends in -xane which is a silicone, hence I assumed it was. I guess you could keep trying or try and return it/sell on MUE."

AustralianMakeup,2yq9jf,missb00,3,Thu Mar 12 03:06:54 2015 UTC,Yeah my understanding is if a silicone is listed in the first 2-3 ingredients along with water it is still classed as silicone

AustralianMakeup,2ym3hk,amyeh,10,Wed Mar 11 06:02:38 2015 UTC,"Pro tip this is what I do every 40% Priceline sale that I want to buy stuff. I shop at my leisure the night before, create a list and include hyperlinks. Then the morning of the sale I buy everything I want online and it takes me a couple minutes. I always buy enough to qualify for free shipping."

AustralianMakeup,2yn20c,sarkata,0,Wed Mar 11 05:31:23 2015 UTC,Agreed. Icon is great. But you need to remember not to close your mouth before they dry because your lips will stick together.

AustralianMakeup,2yn20c,originalaliswan,2,Wed Mar 11 20:20:23 2015 UTC,Super Glossy Lipsticks! I have it in 'Grace' (perfect MLBB for my light yellow/olive skintone). The formula is really comfortable and lightweight. There's a nice shade range - lots of MLBBs for different skin tones and brighter colours.

AustralianMakeup,2yn20c,BBQsauceBel,2,Wed Mar 11 22:43:19 2015 UTC,"Two things:    their mineral baked blush in Coral- so so good! I got this in the last 40% off sale and I wore it half the summer; it's a  great glowy to shimmery blush depending on how much you put on. the long lasting matte lipstick in Bali. I got this as a dupe of MAC Heaux (from one of the Rihanna collections). I have no idea how close to Heaux it is, but the colour is great. It's a purpled berry that fades to a berry pink. It drags on the lip a little, but it doesn't feel dry and it stays all day, even with gloss on top."

They're near Kelvin Grove QUT (easy to get to with public transport!, and Kerri seriously works wonders.   If it's your first appointment you'll get a lengthy brow consult, an amazing shape, and a tint, for ~$60 I believe?  It's awesome going there month to month, of course, but even just getting the initial shaping done and then going somewhere cheaper (like Benefit!) for upkeep would work super well.   I find that my brows look flawless for up to a month between appointments, whereas they seem to start looking straggly after two weeks after just a normal waxing...I think it's all the super detailed tweezing she does. Not the most painless experience, but totally worth it!"

AustralianMakeup,2yilwm,Jessijames,3,Tue Mar 10 03:52:09 2015 UTC,I feel the same. I love that it comes in 4 different colours though! I might pick it up if I can find it on sale but I think I'll pass for the meantime.

The Violet one does literally nothing on me, looks like brown mascara I guess.   The Turquoise one I've fallen in love with though. It is a nice splash of colour, and the mascara itself, while doesn't really thicken or do..much..at all, really, at least seems to lengthen mine fairly satisfactorily.   I'd buy it for the colour, maybe, but it's not the best product."

AustralianMakeup,2yf68l,trignometry,2,Mon Mar 9 10:07:54 2015 UTC,"Hey was your BB a medium shade? My BB this parcel and my CC last parcel were both Medium shades and are way too dark for me.

AustralianMakeup,2yex3u,peachfloyd,4,Mon Mar 9 05:25:50 2015 UTC,"I did find a reputable ebay seller based in the US who sells brands from mostly Ulta/Sephora. Presumably she waits until sales and buys popular items to resell. I've picked up travel size mascaras and lipliners from Too Faced & UD before (to be honest, the only counterfeit UD I have seen anywhere on ebay etc were palettes - there's probably not much market for overseas companies to bother with counterfeit lipliners) with reasonable shipping. Just do your research, it can still be a gamble but there are a few sellers on there that are legit. For brands like Milani & NYX you're fairly safe - again, there's not much reason for these brands to be counterfeited so they're more than likely legit.   If you have reservations, just get somebody on MUE to get you one!"
AustralianMakeup,2yex3u,Jessijames,4,Mon Mar 9 06:09:29 2015 UTC,I agree with /u/Jessijames. However I would like to add that if you are worried you can ask for a photo of proof of purchase. I have done this many times when I was hunting Sephora x Disney items. If the seller is legitimate they will have a receipt from Sephora or MAC or whatever.   Edit: you could always try Bluescandal
AustralianMakeup,2yex3u,WarlockPanda,1 point,Mon Mar 9 06:14:06 2015 UTC,never heard of bluescandal. Have you used it before?
AustralianMakeup,2yex3u,missbo,2,Mon Mar 9 08:43:50 2015 UTC,I shop at Blue Scandal. Some things are cheaper than Beauty Joint and on top of that they always have 25% off. Shipping is weight based so it depends on how much you order. If you're worried about eBay then buy from Blue Scandal.
AustralianMakeup,2yex3u,walkyouhome,1 point,Mon Mar 9 09:10:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah I get all my NYX and Milani from Bluescandal. They have pretty fast shipping, everything is packed nicely and it only winds up being a few dollars more than what you would pay on Ebay. Highly recommend!"

Their pricing seems pretty reasonable to me but keep in mind that you have to add on shipping and convert to AUD when you see your basket total.

AustralianMakeup,2yevm8,livingforpearl_s7,7,Mon Mar 9 05:08:55 2015 UTC,"I bought it so I could teach myself how to contour without shelling out for big products.  I suck, but I'm definitely learning. The best part is that I can use some of the colours for other things - the shimmer highlighter is great for the tear ducts."
AustralianMakeup,2yevm8,amyeh,14,Mon Mar 9 06:03:58 2015 UTC,"unpopular opinion- so please dont downvote me :P-- but i didnt like it. i find the powders cakey (banana powder under my eyes is gross) and lasting power isnt superb and the contours are hard to blend (resorted to using as eyeshadows). most people seem to like it though...but i guess it helps there's nothing else on the physical Australian market like it, and below $20."
AustralianMakeup,2yevm8,gospursgo_,6,Mon Mar 9 06:24:33 2015 UTC,"I thought it was a bit powdery. If you already have a good highlighter and bronzer, then skip it. If not, then give it a go."
AustralianMakeup,2yevm8,compactgirlfriend,5,Mon Mar 9 08:32:18 2015 UTC,"I'm really trying to get into the kit, but it's hard. I find the contour powders don't blend well - once I blend them out, they're basically invisible, and before that they're a stark line. I love the shimmer powder, and use that a lot as a highlighter, but that's about it. It's a real shame :( Warning though, I'm also just terrible at contouring!"
AustralianMakeup,2yevm8,Artemisian11,4,Mon Mar 9 13:25:42 2015 UTC,"Worth it, worth it, worth it.   I bought it in the height of the hype and really didn't think I was going to like it but it's actually completely amazing. Highly pigmented, last well (with primer and setting spray, not sure about without) and looks completely natural on me in sunlight. Super super blendable. Best purchase I ever made."
AustralianMakeup,2yevm8,SizzlingVivacity,2,Mon Mar 9 05:57:27 2015 UTC,"I bought it. I like it. Use it often actually. I swatched a friends Anastasia Beverley hills contour palette yesterday and didn't find that the pay off wasn't what I was expecting. I go very light handed with the contour shade with a clean brush every time no matter who I use it on and blend it out as necessary.   If it's ""not blending"" buy the Anastasia kit as it requires a heavier hand to get similar pay off. You can also blend back into skin with your foundation brush."
AustralianMakeup,2yevm8,LMTartistry,2,Mon Mar 9 12:11:08 2015 UTC,"If you have pale skin like me I probably wouldn't bother. The contour shades look dirty on my skin and show up very obviously no matter how much I blend. Tbh I don't use the banana powder often so I can't really comment on that. The other two highlight shades (one matte, one shimmer) are gloooorrrriousss though. The shimmer shade is probably the best Priceline (drugstore, whatever) highlighter that I've found. Overall, I probably won't repurchase but it's a nice thing to have on hand and have a play with."
AustralianMakeup,2yevm8,paradoxgirl44,2,Mon Mar 9 10:35:29 2015 UTC,"The contour shades aren't great on my lily white skin tone, it's pretty good to have in my kit though. I'd rather stick to my Sleek Face Form Kit in Fair. I'd get a Sleek contour kit (hitting pan after EIGHTEEN MONTHS in the contour shade) if I could it in Fair. It depends what the palette is for, really. Do you want a few contour shades and highlighters and are not super pale? Great! Want that one perfect contour colour? Probably try elsewhere."
AustralianMakeup,2yevm8,tracesoflace,2,Mon Mar 9 11:25:19 2015 UTC,"Given the lack of any similar (and decently priced) products over here, it's not a bad thing to buy if you're desperate for a contour palette.       I'm quite pale (NC15), and don't mind the way the shades look on my skin - the banana colour I particularly like for highlighting  That said, the product itself is quite chalky, and doesn't last long on my skin - which is dry, I might add. I also suspect it broke me out (rarely happens). Ditto what others have said about it being harsh before blending, and near invisible after. It's convenient having all the highlighting/contour shades in one palette, but I'd invest in something different."
AustralianMakeup,2yevm8,jabski,2,Wed Mar 11 01:53:19 2015 UTC,I've been thinking about it for ages but decided against it because I just don't need all those colours. I already have a good contour colour (taupe by nyx or mac) and setting/highlighting powders and just don't need the other shades. I am on a no/low buy though so maybe I'm just trying to convince myself against buying more!
AustralianMakeup,2yevm8,damn-croissants,1 point,Mon Mar 9 06:54:30 2015 UTC,I bought it when it was first released and Ive not been overly impressed by it. It's super powdery and the contour shades are far too dark for me as a super pale (Nw15) girl. I like the shimmer highlight shade but that's about it. The yellow and pink toned highlights aren't light enough for me and are very polarising as I am not yellow or pink undertoned. I'm keeping it just to do other people's makeup but that's the only reason I haven't palmed it off to someone else.
AustralianMakeup,2yevm8,ningnongnanapants,1 point,Mon Mar 9 09:54:59 2015 UTC,"I find it too powdery for my tastes, and the contour colours are really hard to blend - not to mention none of them are a good match for me. For the price it's ok, but I'm really only keeping it around for the yellow shade. As others have said, if you have good contour and highlight products already, skip it."
AustralianMakeup,2yevm8,missb00,1 point,Mon Mar 9 10:09:56 2015 UTC,"I said no at first, then it went on sale and I said yes. I'm weak.  But seriously, it is a bit on the powdery side but I find it easier than cream products. I've yet to try the banana shade but I've seen it applied on other people and it really does brighten the under eye area. Not sure about creasing or longevity though. I'm NC20 so not pale but I do tend to avoid the darker shade because it comes off a bit reddish, which is not good for getting that shadow effect in the hollows of the cheek. I think it's a great palette especially for it's price."
AustralianMakeup,2yevm8,Tea_inthegoodroom,1 point,Mon Mar 9 11:19:15 2015 UTC,"I can only really use it when I'm fake tanned because otherwise the contour shades are too dark. I think it's great though, especially with how cheap it is :)  I probably only use about 4 shades out of the 6 though."
AustralianMakeup,2yevm8,violetbang,1 point,Tue Mar 10 06:05:21 2015 UTC,"I actually really like it! I've seen a few people say that the powders don't blend or they're too dark, but I find them really easy to work with. At first I had a bit of trouble because they were so pigmented, but now I can work well with them.   I normally apply them using a very dense bronzing brush, which I pinch slightly so that the bristles taper inwards. Before I touch my face with the product, I swipe the brush across a tissue. If you don't get rid of some of the product first, it won't blend at all.   I find that it lasts all day and depending on how you apply it, you can definitely make it look near-natural. I doubt that there would be a lot of contour powders out there that look natural, as any contouring generally looks quite unnatural."
AustralianMakeup,2yevm8,MenstrualFlow,1 point,Wed Mar 11 07:32:35 2015 UTC,"I dipped my fingers into my classmate's AC ON TOUR. The pigmentation is really good. However, the shades are quite dark. I hear mixed reviews on it and it seems like those with fairer skin can't make it work due to the shades being too muddy and dark. I think it would work well on olive/dark medium tones."
AustralianMakeup,2yevm8,Teacupbunny,1 point,Wed Mar 11 11:45:10 2015 UTC,"I only purchased mine recently after wanting it for months (it was sold out everywhere).  It's not the best product I've ever used but it is good value for money (got mine via the $3 off sale, so it was only $13). Some advice I would give is to use a very light hand - I'm super pale so some of these look a bit like dirt when they are applied too heavily (anything more than just a light touch) or not insanely blended out."
AustralianMakeup,2yevm8,missbilly,1 point,Wed Mar 11 12:21:55 2015 UTC,I am pretty pale and I really like it.  The colours are a bit powdery so you do have to be pretty careful with them. I barely touch my brush in the contour colours and then tap off the excess and that is the perfect amount for me. I find that they stay in my face all day as well.
AustralianMakeup,2yevm8,kittenishgirl,1 point,Thu Mar 12 01:29:26 2015 UTC,"I'm Nc35 and I love mine. Admittedly they are powdery and I can definitely see that some people would find it hard to blend out., I personally use powder foundation so it blends pretty well. I also use a setting spray to counteract any powderyness/cakeyness."
AustralianMakeup,2yevm8,DominionGalactica,1 point,Thu Mar 12 09:47:10 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking of getting it too if I can find it but I'm NW10 and not sure if it will really work on me being so fair (plus freckles, so not sure contour really works at all in the end)"
AustralianMakeup,2yevm8,kittenishgirl,2,Mon Mar 9 07:40:08 2015 UTC,"Just make sure you really tap off excess, and use a light hand. I love using it, just took a bit of practice with such high pigment."

I blame the poor bathroom lighting and not having brutally honest friends"
AustralianMakeup,2ybmxo,Teacupbunny,5,Sun Mar 8 08:55:24 2015 UTC,"Oh, and friends should always be able to tell you that something isn't right. I used to hate it when I looked in the mirror at a party/club and I had smudged whatever on my face and no one told me. So I make a point of telling friends now that I want to know, and I won't be offended."
AustralianMakeup,2ybmxo,Flippantry,3,Sun Mar 8 11:20:53 2015 UTC,"I think the best piece of advice I ever heard regarding foundation was that you should have a 'wardrobe' of foundations, depending on the season/your colouring. I actually get darker in winter cause I am outside more (winter sport), so I need darker foundations in winter and lighter ones in summer. It took me a couple of seasons to realise it wasn't just a marketing gimmick, and that I was in fact different colours at different times of the year. I feel your pain."

I felt good, I got compliments, I had fun playing with my makeup and it led me to wear I am today, makeup-wise.  The most embarrassing thing for me was the people I let influence me. One day I was hanging out with a friend and her older sister. The sister said ""Only sluts put their eyeliner anywhere else but [lower waterline]"". I believed her. For about a week, until I next did my makeup and tried putting my black pencil on my waterline rather than my lashline and hated it (and stabbed myself in the eye). Another time I let myself get upset when a girl I didn't even like told me I wore too much makeup. I even cried, which of course ruined said makeup. I don't even know why I cared, but for an hour or so I was deadset going to throw my eyeliner away. Luckily my head of boarding (and stand-in mum) swooped in with some encouraging words and cotton buds to fix the streaks. I have a million little stories like that. I loved how I looked but I let other people's opinions creep in and acted like an idiot sometimes because of it."

I wasn't much of a makeup wearer in my teens as stage makeup gave me my fill. But until about the age of 14 I thought you were supposed to wear foundation darker than your skin tone. And even with all those years of stage makeup and liquid eyeliner I still CANNOT apply it. I've simply given up.

The girl immediately latched on and insisted I sit down so she could put it on me. I obliged, as it was an early morning flight and I had no makeup on anyway, so I wanted I see how it looked. She did one eye, then started pushing me to buy it! I declined as politely as I could, and then she just walked away.   Not really knowing what to do, I went back to my husband and told him what happened. I think he was pretty amused, but was very sympathetic and helped me hide my face.

Fergie also did a line for them, I see people raving about the eye primer for it all the time. The ELF studio brushes (black handle) are only $3 over there vs $8 here. I've also heard that Real Technique and Ecotools are less than half the price there than they are here."

I am sure there are more bargains to be had. Just check the US Sephora website or maybe Nordies.   Drugstore brands are heaps cheaper too. When I was in Honolulu a couple of years ago I went to Walmart and picked up cheap Physicians Formula stuff. I'm sure I saved about 40%. Revlon and Maybelline are well priced there too.   Our dollar is pretty sad right now, though, so the savings may not be that great. Do your currency conversion homework. :)"

I use Too Faced Shadow Insurance too and it's great with indies for me - normally I go over the parts of my eye where I want a bit more oomph with a teensy bit of glitter glue, let it dry for about 30 seconds, then pat more shadow on.

AustralianMakeup,2xzkwf,pondicus,2,Thu Mar 5 08:24:23 2015 UTC,"Ooh okay, it's a pretty good oil-controlling powder I reckon - the kaolin clay ingredient should keep your skin matte. The majority of reviews on it are positive, so I think most people have a good chance of having it work. See if you can pick up a sample to use for a day or so before going back to get a full size (if you like it enough). The packaging is really annoying, but the product is good. How long are you in Sydney for?  Normally powder is used to set concealer, give your skin an even finish or even use under foundation aka the Wayne Goss foundation method to give your skin a smooth canvas before foundation.  If you're still new to makeup, I'd watch a lot of YouTube videos - mainly Lisa Eldridge, she has an awesome series on how to choose foundation. Try to avoid vids that are basically product pushing!"

However with the atrocious exchange rate at the moment (USD$1 = ~$0.73AUD) it favours you.  That being said, try and stick to your supply of makeup you're bringing over from the States. It's not going to be cheaper here. The only ""unique"" brands are the cheaper brands like Australis and even then I would be quite careful about their products - very hit or miss.  Urban Decay is launching in Mecca soon I believe so if you like UD then getting your hands on some here won't be a hassle. Although you will have to fight your way through some crazy shoppers who are so desperate at new launches it's embarrassing.  tl;dr Buy as much makeup as you will need for 2 years (because makeup does expire), ship it here and use that.

AustralianMakeup,2xrdhy,Touchwood,4,Tue Mar 3 09:00:58 2015 UTC,Saw a huge pile like this at the Gawler Place Priceline in Adelaide. It was very surprising.

AustralianMakeup,2xrdhy,Teacupbunny,2,Tue Mar 3 10:01:11 2015 UTC,"oh man, it's so hard to find drugstore products that are talc-free!"
AustralianMakeup,2xrdhy,faithlessdisciple,2,Wed Mar 4 07:16:01 2015 UTC,Oh no!! At least you saw it before you bought it
AustralianMakeup,2xrrcl,Touchwood,2,Tue Mar 3 09:08:49 2015 UTC,"I also got the CC cream last week, and thought it was pretty decent! (& the fair shade actually matches me from the test I did, wooooh!)"
AustralianMakeup,2xrrcl,jamballdonut,1 point,Wed Mar 4 04:43:56 2015 UTC,What type of skin do you have? I can't find any reviews for it and I'm sooo curious about it because it comes in a Fair shade

I haven't actually worn it for longer than about an hour on one cheek, but I'm planning on trying it out properly on Saturday and seeing how it goes.  The Fair shade is actually the one I have, and it suits me sooo well! I've never had one light enough!"

AustralianMakeup,2xrrcl,KindOfOldNewGirl,2,Thu Mar 5 09:36:27 2015 UTC,I bought the CC cream and the eyeliner gift pack for $39.95 instore and got the BB Cream as well. It's such good value!    10 eyeliners and 2x Creams for $39.95 is amazeballs.  I also like that the BB/CC cream is made in South Korea.  I have been wanting to try korean BB/CC cream but I'm a medium to tanned complexion and don't match with any asian beauty creams :(
AustralianMakeup,2xrrcl,alyss0r,1 point,Fri Mar 6 10:42:15 2015 UTC,"I was thinking on cashing in on this offer but I honestly can't think of anything to spend $30 on, haha.   It would also be nice if the BB creams came in a Fair shade"

AustralianMakeup,2xs8yv,ezmereldah,2,Fri Mar 6 17:10:49 2015 UTC,Shu Uemura's eyelash curler!! It works wonders for my eyes and it's only available at David Jones. Their oil cleansers are amazing as well :)
AustralianMakeup,2xs8yv,WarlockPanda,2,Wed Mar 4 12:26:08 2015 UTC,"I second the eyelash curler recommendation. I've had mine for at least 5 years now and I love it. I don't think I've even changed the rubber in it, but I may have? Still works just as good as the day I got it, best $30 I've ever spent."
AustralianMakeup,2xs8yv,pondicus,2,Thu Mar 5 02:33:03 2015 UTC,Will try! Can I ask what makes it so good?
AustralianMakeup,2xs8yv,Haibarai,3,Fri Mar 6 16:59:43 2015 UTC,"I can't even put my finger on it anymore, cause it's the only one I've used for about 5 years now. It's solid, whereas I snapped one from a different brand. The rubber hadn't worn down, and I've had it for ages. It doesn't hurt, but I've had others in the past that no matter how you position them, they pull and pinch badly. Most of all, it gives a superior curl."
AustralianMakeup,2xs8yv,Teacupbunny,2,Fri Mar 6 21:41:26 2015 UTC,Not strictly makeup but if fake tan is your jam you should try Ella Bache. I've used their cream and the spray and I love them both! I like to use the spray then keep it up all summer by using dove every day and mixing the cream with dove once a week :)
AustralianMakeup,2xs8yv,peachfloyd,1 point,Sat Mar 7 07:02:32 2015 UTC,"Is there anything you want that you don't already have in your collection. I would highly recommend MAC lipsticks, but the price is quite high in Australia ($36-$38 each). I would also recommend looking at the Laura Mercier counter. They have some great product, however the LE items can be hit and miss so google some reviews before buying."
AustralianMakeup,2xqhjl,full_boyle,5,Tue Mar 3 01:17:37 2015 UTC,"I seriously love this stuff. Gives your face such a lovely glow and I could even tell a difference with it on just a bare face.  It comes in 3 shades - Photo Ready (a pink one), Soft Focus (a champagne one, this is the one I've got) and Radiant Bronze (a darker, bronze one). There used to be a 4th shade, Luminous Glow (a golden shade), but I think they discontinued it."
AustralianMakeup,2xqhjl,criti_biti,1 point,Tue Mar 3 01:20:19 2015 UTC,"I was in a priceline today that had Luminous glow, it's like a shimmery version of the bronzer right? There was definitely four distinct testers though."
AustralianMakeup,2xqhjl,pyjamasquid,1 point,Tue Mar 3 10:52:50 2015 UTC,"Oh, the Priceline website was only showing 3 shades and the Priceline I was at only had 2 shades, so I was just basing it on that. That's annoying though 'cos Luminous Glow is the one I would've preferred."
AustralianMakeup,2xqhjl,Artemisian11,1 point,Tue Mar 3 12:37:17 2015 UTC,"I remember reading a blogpost where someone mentioned that Luminous Glow is only available in stores, and not online? I don't know why, but that seems to be what's happening."
AustralianMakeup,2xqhjl,walkyouhome,1 point,Wed Mar 4 02:44:18 2015 UTC,Confirming Luminous Glow was in stock at my local Sydney Priceline last week!
AustralianMakeup,2xqhjl,walkyouhome,1 point,Tue Mar 3 13:09:32 2015 UTC,"Little update: I went to the Priceline near my uni and found Luminous Glow. Was actually a little disappointed in it - it has noticeable glitter in it as opposed to Soft Glow (which is what i'm using) which is more of a sheen, if that makes sense."
AustralianMakeup,2xqhjl,patootiebah,6,Wed Mar 4 06:08:23 2015 UTC,Have you tried the Hourglass Ambient Lighting Powders at all? I'd be interested to see if this is comparable. It looks lovely!
AustralianMakeup,2xqhjl,A_Curiosity,6,Tue Mar 3 03:04:22 2015 UTC,I haven't tried them. I bought the Models Prefer powder on a whim and when I googled it almost all the reviews have said it's a dupe of the Hourglass powder.  This review and another one here have photo comparisons of the two :)
AustralianMakeup,2xqhjl,patootiebah,3,Tue Mar 3 03:11:24 2015 UTC,"Okay, looks like I'm heading to Priceline tonight... :)"

AustralianMakeup,2xqhjl,DiabolicalCheesecake,4,Tue Mar 3 03:41:51 2015 UTC,I also bought this stuff on a whim (I was sad because I couldn't afford the Hourglass ones) and I LOVE it. Amazing product for the price!
AustralianMakeup,2xqhjl,DiabolicalCheesecake,3,Tue Mar 3 03:30:24 2015 UTC,"It's seriously just the best stuff. I think I'm going to skip even using BB cream, and just use a bit of concealer + this powder from now on."

AustralianMakeup,2xqhjl,HRM_Monster,2,Tue Mar 3 22:26:28 2015 UTC,"Forgive me for sounding a bit noobish, but where do you apply this kind of powder? Just in the highlight areas? As blush? All over the face as a finishing powder?"
AustralianMakeup,2xrgxx,crossesafimelb,3,Tue Mar 3 06:38:26 2015 UTC,"That cheap brand, Essence, you can find in Priceline and Target has a really good for the price (something stupid like $2). A bit of loose change for seeing if you like gel liners!"
AustralianMakeup,2xrgxx,full_boyle,1 point,Tue Mar 3 08:34:11 2015 UTC,Second this! They're pretty awesome for the price. I bought 3 of them!

AustralianMakeup,2xrgxx,jamballdonut,2,Wed Mar 4 04:52:25 2015 UTC,I have oily eyelids and Models Prefer is the only one I've found so far that stays all day. It's $10 from Priceline.

AustralianMakeup,2xn66z,breviloquent-,7,Mon Mar 2 05:57:43 2015 UTC,"So I understand where you are coming from in terms of exchange rates but the dollar was stronger against the pound at that time (from memory, I have to check). But you will also find that particular prices on beauty bay tend to fluctuate frequently depending on supply and demand. Since the chocolate bar palette was released about that time last year there would have been a higher demand for it. Higher demand means higher prices. So they charge more. Similarly you will find they charge a premium on urban decay products: there is a huge demand for them.  Edit: Mac pricing sucks atm. As the dollar decreases agains the USD their pricing will look more comparable."

AustralianMakeup,2xjx3z,BBQsauceBel,1 point,Mon Mar 2 00:59:28 2015 UTC,The lip lacquers were $25. I've got 2 so far... Tempted to go back and get more
AustralianMakeup,2xjm59,PalmTreesAreUs,3,Sun Mar 1 07:49:25 2015 UTC,"Pacific Fair is another shopping center which is probably a bit closer than Robina. It doesn't have a Mecca (Robina does) but has most of the big stores (Myer, Priceline, Target). You'll get David Jones at Robina too.   If you get a chance to get up to Brisbane (only an hour on the train) there's a couple of little specialty shops like HUB makeup in the city, Beserk is an online alternative store that does makeup and you can pick up your things at Bowen Hills (two train stations away from the city) so you don't have to pay for postage. Makeup and Glow is in Paddington and is open to the public on Saturdays."
AustralianMakeup,2xfwf3,chocolatespeckle,3,Sat Feb 28 06:47:13 2015 UTC,"I did a search to see if this had been posted yet (just got back from overseas yesterday and haven't been on reddit) but didn't see it and thought I would share in case other people had been looking forward to it as well.   I checked Sephora today and as the title states, the Tartelette palette was in stock! I asked and they apparently came in 2 days ago. I picked one up myself as it was $64 compared to US$44 (converted comes to about AU$57), which I thought was reasonably priced. There were about 20 on the shelf, and while I don't know if there were more in a drawer I did see several other girls buying them, and the SA said they were flying off the shelves. So get in quick :)  I haven't played with my new palette yet, but I did swatch it in store and the shades are very soft and pigmented. If anyone else has bought this already, let us know how you like it!  Also I don't know when they lowered the prices the Tarte blushes but they're now $36! They were $42 when Sephora first opened and according to our collection of Sephora prices."
AustralianMakeup,2xfwf3,Sleiphy,1 point,Sat Feb 28 06:50:29 2015 UTC,Oh this is what I've been waiting for! Missed out on all the tarte Christmas sets so hopefully this one will still be around in a couple of weeks. I've added it to the price post as well as the blushes.

AustralianMakeup,2xfsh7,WarlockPanda,1 point,Sat Feb 28 06:53:02 2015 UTC,No problem. TBH I find the formula can vary a lot between colours. Violet Riot in this case has the best formulation. I would also recommend Exotic Orchid for a lovely lilac colour and their reds are beautiful too.

AustralianMakeup,2xavap,phattoes,7,Fri Feb 27 01:26:19 2015 UTC,"So I bought two Maybelline Colour Tattoo 24hrs in the creme range: 45 Bold Gold and 25 Bad to the Bronze. Named appropriately 'Tattoo', this stuff stays. All day yesterday with the Bronze and it came off with a little work.  Word to the wise: it really does stay. Today I thought I'd use them to practice a dramatic look for a night-out. I did this at midday. Then when it came to wiping it off it does not budge. I am meeting people this arvo for possible housemates (dramatic night eyes severely out of place) and I had to scratch it off and now my eyeballs hurt.  So yeah, it bloody stays.  Strong pigments and I lurrve the gold. There weren't many colours from my local Target unless you're attending an 80's themed party but I would definitely stock up on a tonne of these."
AustralianMakeup,2xavap,wildmareep,5,Fri Feb 27 01:35:50 2015 UTC,Use an oil based makeup/eye make up remover or mineral oil or any other carrier oil you know won't break you out or cause issues and they come off easy peasy
AustralianMakeup,2xavap,Dtapped,2,Fri Feb 27 03:10:49 2015 UTC,I've got the purple and turquoise but haven't found time to experiment yet. The gold looks worth a try as well.

AustralianMakeup,2x6hwe,xenomorphic_acid,2,Thu Feb 26 01:44:04 2015 UTC,I went out and bought that clear lip liner last night because of this thread.

AustralianMakeup,2x6hwe,pyjamasquid,3,Thu Feb 26 02:37:34 2015 UTC,I was convinced to buy the models prefer soft touch mineral powders just based on that blog post! It is really good as well - I have the slightly pink-toned one and it works great as an luminiser/blush.

I didn't want to buy it and have the same lack of effect as Diffused Light, so I guess for me the Model's Prefer version was a way to try it out, and I'm really happy to see that blog post mention how similar they are. So when I finish it, I'm definitely going to buy Mood Light! Maybe think of it that way: that now you know the colour is great for you, but there wouldn't be much point buying the higher end version until you've used up the other (unless you destash it)!"

I enjoy their eyeshadow palettes that were released for Christmas - Party Glam, Nude, and Day to Night.  They're not AMAZING, but they're pretty good for $10.  I also LOVELOVELOVE their brushes.  I first bought them a few years ago, when MP were having 50% off, including brushes, and they've held up SO WELL since.  (Other than me melting part of my favourite one, whoops!) Their Airbrush Foundation Brush (the one I melted some of :( ) is apparently a good ""dupe"" of the Real Techniques Buffing Brush.  Super amazing.  I'm planning on buying WAY more of the range next time they have a 40 or 50% off sale.  I'm NOT a fan of their liquid foundation though.  I bought 1 many years ago (Maybe like 3 or 4 years ago?) and it was horrible.  I was also inexperienced with makeup back then, and have heard they've gotten better/possibly re-formulated? but I haven't tried any of them again yet."

Bought a gift set in the Priceline sale last year for $6, gave them to my 8yo niece as play makeuo. They were like softened playdough in texture, appearance and smell.  Ok: their eye shadow palettes. Not as good as my Naked2 palette, but for $10 they are pretty decent. Lots of fallout though, so that is annoying.  Good: the double ended brushes that come with the eyeshadow palettes. Seriously, love them! They are so soft and work really way. The brushes alone are worth at least the cost of the palette.   My SIL really loves their BB cream, but I  yet to try it."

But they discontinued it before I could re buy it and now I have to live without it. It was the only foundation I've found in a light enough and perfect colour match. The right amount of coverage for me and also lasted so well and stayed delightfully matte without being drying. I could rave about it all day.  It was the Models Prefer infinite colour foundation in Shell.   I also have their little $10 10 shade nude palette. And for the price it's pretty good. It's usually my go to travel palette because it's just so convenient.

AustralianMakeup,2x6st3,byggie,2,Thu Feb 26 20:02:15 2015 UTC,I do sporadically. She seems like a nice young lady (lol that makes me sound like I'm old but I do think she conducts herself like a lady) who is really growing into herself and has a lot of potential to do good things for the beauty community but I'm not watching her for her makeup. She has good technique and does lots of nice wearable simple looks that are great for younger girls/beginners but that's not my jam. I think she gives very sound advice and has a very level head considering how 'internet famous she is'.

AustralianMakeup,2x4d6f,icicle_,11,Wed Feb 25 15:49:52 2015 UTC,"Aaah I am a fellow SFS sufferer. Mine is so embarrassing. I will have a full on sweat mustache while everyone else is cool and calm. I follow the same Wayne Goss routine (primer, powder, BB cream, powder, setting spray) which helps keep my makeup on through the blotting, but it does not stop the sweating. I don't know if makeup actually can. In my experience it makes it worse. I'm actually looking into a small amount of Botox in my upper lip as it can help with excessive sweating."
AustralianMakeup,2x4d6f,miss_marshwiggle,3,Wed Feb 25 20:38:57 2015 UTC,Have you been diagnosed with Hyperhidrosis? I went to three different doctors and a dermatologist before someone finally knew what actually caused my excessive sweating.
AustralianMakeup,2x4d6f,puffandruffle,2,Wed Feb 25 21:33:57 2015 UTC,I haven't been formally diagnosed but I have PCOS and all the lovely related problems like too high a level of androgens and insulin resistance that can cause hyperhidrosis.
AustralianMakeup,2x4d6f,miss_marshwiggle,2,Wed Feb 25 21:48:27 2015 UTC,"I do agree that I don't think makeup can actually help it - and that sucks. I get little beads of sweat on my nose that are super noticeable. It's weird because everyone else will be, like you said, cool and calm and not even be breaking a sweat in 30 degree heat outside, whilst I'm there sweating so much it's embarrassing.   Botox sounds like an interesting idea - best of luck with that, I didn't even know!"
AustralianMakeup,2x4d6f,insiped,6,Thu Feb 26 00:54:41 2015 UTC,You can buy face antiperspirant for about $15 from chemists! They're a gel formula that you apply underneath your makeup :)

AustralianMakeup,2x4d6f,readorignoreit,3,Wed Feb 25 18:01:16 2015 UTC,"I can sweat through my makeup in an air conditioned room. It's got nothing to do with temperature and more to do with the fact that my body doesn't know when to stop sweating. I control it as best I can, using the Wayne Goss method, blotting during the day. You can't stop it from happening, you can only touch up during the day to keep your face looking fresh"
AustralianMakeup,2x4d6f,puffandruffle,3,Wed Feb 25 21:37:43 2015 UTC,"Have you tried facial deodorant? It's a thing... A friend of mine tried it, worked reasonably well for her except her upper lip. You can get it from Chemist Warehouse, can't remember the brand."
AustralianMakeup,2x4d6f,missbo,3,Wed Feb 25 21:25:18 2015 UTC,I do recommend trying this with one more piece of advice: PATCH TEST ALWAYS. I suffer from Hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating) and I thought that these facial antiperspirants were going to be my savior. Not so much. I didn't patch test before I used it (they also have one for the soles of your feet) and I was so itchy I thought I was going to scratch my face off. Be sure to read the ingredients and make sure the product you're picking up is right for you.
AustralianMakeup,2x4d6f,dark_lane,1 point,Wed Feb 25 21:31:09 2015 UTC,How do they test if you have hyperhydrosis?
AustralianMakeup,2x4d6f,dark_lane,1 point,Thu Feb 26 03:00:48 2015 UTC,"Wow, yeah I've never heard of this, I'll definitely have to give it a go, thankyou!   The only thing I'd be concerned about is whether it could cause cystic acne or buildup under the skin at all? (I'm not a skincare specialist or anything so someone enlighten me). My skin has had cystic acne breakouts in the past, especially in reaction to certain primers with silicone as the main ingredient."
AustralianMakeup,2x4d6f,sarkata,2,Thu Feb 26 00:57:29 2015 UTC,"Hooray! I'm not the only one!!! SFS sufferers unite!   I use this weird antiperspirant that you apply a couple of times a week at night, let it settle in and wash it off in the morning. I'm not sure if it's as effective as the gels you apply before your makeup, but it's made a noticeable difference for me. It's calls 'sweat no more' and comes in a few different kinds for different areas (it's probably all the same stuff in different packaging). I have a chronic illness that means the sheer effort of standing up or concentrating too hard makes me break out in a sweat - putting on make up every morning (acne!) is a race against time for me. This product has really helped cut down on the sweat-face.    The key is that you have to apply it to a completely clean and dry face. If your skin isn't fully dry, it stings like a bastard. Also, I once forgot and licked my lips straight after applying it - weirdest sensation ever to have antiperspirant on your tongue.   I have bad cystic acne, and it certainly didn't make it any worse.  I got mine at chemists warehouse for about $13."

AustralianMakeup,2x4d6f,criticalenemy,1 point,Fri Feb 27 01:15:56 2015 UTC,On the nights I use it I don't moisturise at all and just do extra in the morning to make up for it.
AustralianMakeup,2x4d6f,sydneysomething,2,Fri Feb 27 06:43:44 2015 UTC,"Going to be honest, most summer days I just avoid applying makeup above my upper lip because I know I'm going to sweat it off immediately."

I'm also of average height and build so it's not over exertion either, I think."
AustralianMakeup,2x4d6f,criticalenemy,1 point,Thu Feb 26 03:22:20 2015 UTC,"I use the 3B Face Saver gel. I bought it from a pharmacy and I love it. I only use it occasionally because I'm not much of a foundation person, but I find that when I do use it my makeup looks lovely and not sweaty at all. I don't know that I'd be comfortable using it every day though. I just like not sweating insane amounts on my forehead etc when I very slightly exert myself in summer.

AustralianMakeup,2x3p1n,Touchwood,1 point,Sat Feb 28 03:59:24 2015 UTC,"Meh, I don't get why this is a problem for some people. First of all she's showing off the makeup with real world face movement, instead of a static pose. Secondly what's wrong with someone feeling pretty and showing it off? The entire world seems to have a problem with women feeling good about their looks and is always trying to teach them they're not good enough, they don't look good enough, but when they dare to reach those standards, they have to be modest and talk themselves down and pretend they don't feel like they are good enough, or even beautiful. I... realise I got carried away and took it on a tangent here, but I don't understand why it's cringe worthy. Showing off is only a problem if you're trying to bring others down at the same time and the majority of the time it's not the case when Youtubers do this type of posing. Show off what you're proud of girls! You deserve to feel good and you deserve to feel beautiful even when the whole world is trying to tell you you arent'! [rant over]"

AustralianMakeup,2x3rj6,cherry_cocopops,3,Wed Feb 25 12:50:34 2015 UTC,Price is terrific. There is a lot of loose powder & I find the contour colours are pretty warm and can look dirty easily. The matte & shimmer highlighters do a great job. Definitely worth the purchase for the price but probably not as great as the Anastasia version
AustralianMakeup,2x3rj6,liss29,2,Wed Feb 25 13:24:45 2015 UTC,"I really like it and use it almost everyday. I primarily use 3 of powders to fill in my eyebrows, bronzer, contour and to set my concealer. I'm an NC25-30 and the tones are great for me."
AustralianMakeup,2x3rj6,miss_marshwiggle,2,Wed Feb 25 15:51:26 2015 UTC,"It's ok. I know lots of people who don't like it. I'm really pale (NC10-15ish) so the contour colours are a little too dark for me but with heaps of blending I can make them work. Particularly the middle one. They're quite powdery but workable. I love the banana highlight shade for under my eyes and I use the other highlights almost daily. I would suggest holding out until Australis goes on sale again, then it is a real bargain!!"
AustralianMakeup,2x3rj6,Bulbysaur123,2,Wed Feb 25 21:14:18 2015 UTC,"The highlighters are amazing, I struggle with the contours though, always makes my skin look dirty, and hard to blend out. I could just be doing it wrong though."
AustralianMakeup,2x3rj6,jen-iscool,3,Wed Feb 25 23:39:52 2015 UTC,Yeah i feel the same way. When I use the contours i only put on a tiny tiny little bit. I tap the brush on sometimes like 10 times before i use it
AustralianMakeup,2x3rj6,Bulbysaur123,1 point,Thu Feb 26 00:21:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah totally, I just dab it and blow it before I put it on and it still seems too much. It seems to work better when I use a softer more spread out brush than a contour brush though."

AustralianMakeup,2x3rj6,alleeexxxx,1 point,Fri Feb 27 06:04:42 2015 UTC,"oooo thank you girl (or guy..)! I tried Garden City yesterday but they were sold out, do you mean in the city itself or Carousel, not too sure where the CBD Westfield is.."

AustralianMakeup,2x3rj6,Tazerin,1 point,Sat Feb 28 11:35:48 2015 UTC,"I bloody love it. The texture of the powders is really soft and smooth (maybe a tad powdery but that doesn't bother me), pigmented but not so pigmented that you have to be super careful to not pick up too much, the colours are all useable on a range of skintones, the shinmery highlight isn't frosty, it's cheap. I need a backup 🙈"
AustralianMakeup,2x3rj6,madups,1 point,Fri Feb 27 08:30:52 2015 UTC,"I was really impressed with it!  My skin is fairly light with cool tones and I find that I can use all of the highlight shades in the palette, and the central dark shade is cool enough that it doesn't look weird on me. I can also use the right-hand contour shade sparingly if I want something more dramatic. The yellow-tinted highlight shade brightens up my skin and blends well enough that it doesn't look mismatched!  One thing I didn't like was that there seems to be a lot of product wastage as the powder comes loose from the pan very easily.  But on the whole, I'm very happy with the product for the price! Australis is really stepping up their game and I love it."
AustralianMakeup,2x28i6,gospursgo_,5,Wed Feb 25 01:42:31 2015 UTC,NYX Butter glosses for sure! They're really opaque and aren't sticky. I love them.
AustralianMakeup,2x28i6,Teacupbunny,2,Wed Feb 25 03:41:47 2015 UTC,I'm a recent convert to these too. Perfect application every time even for someone who isn't so confident with lips (like me). The colour range is really unusual but I like that - they cover a lot of burgundy/purples I don't usually see.
AustralianMakeup,2x28i6,MidnightNation,1 point,Sat Feb 28 05:40:20 2015 UTC,any colours in particular you like?

AustralianMakeup,2x28i6,WarlockPanda,3,Wed Feb 25 07:35:01 2015 UTC,Absolutely love the Maybelline Color Elixirs! They stain nicely as well. They're a bit on the pricey side tho (IIRC $16.95?)

AustralianMakeup,2x28i6,beautyistruth14,2,Wed Feb 25 08:35:59 2015 UTC,"I really enjoy Chi Chi lip glosses (I have a whole tonne of mini ones from various gift sets, so not sure if they're also available in larger ones?) and NYX Butter Glosses.  I haaaate sticky glosses, and the NYX ones are really nice for not being sticky, but still looking glossy and nice."

AustralianMakeup,2x28i6,sydneysomething,1 point,Wed Feb 25 15:40:51 2015 UTC,If you're willing to purchase online then I love the LA Girl lip glaze paints. They're like a creamier version of lip tars and a bit thicker. I got mine from Blue Scandal.

AustralianMakeup,2wz1gf,pureneonn,3,Tue Feb 24 10:01:13 2015 UTC,"It's only going to be retailed at Mecca Maxima and mecca.com.au. From my quick googling, you guys only have Mecca Cosmetica :("
AustralianMakeup,2wz1gf,One_of_a_Kind,4,Wed Feb 25 21:31:56 2015 UTC,Now to pray that Mecca starts stocking Anastasia

AustralianMakeup,2wz1gf,boopyboop,2,Tue Feb 24 20:21:33 2015 UTC,oh wow they do! thank you :)
AustralianMakeup,2wz1gf,gvvl,2,Wed Feb 25 03:17:54 2015 UTC,You're welcome! I actually found them by accident on their website and haven't seen anyone mention it on here so I'm glad to get the word out :)
AustralianMakeup,2wz1gf,boopyboop,1 point,Wed Feb 25 06:13:52 2015 UTC,"Sadly I think Sephora got the rights to Anastasia, so I doubt Mecca will be able to stock them, at least for the foreseeable future"
AustralianMakeup,2wz1gf,sarkata,10,Wed Feb 25 00:12:47 2015 UTC,"This is actually really good, especially with the current currency exchange rate between US and Oz!   50USD = 65AUD, plus 15 for taxes/shipping/whatever.   I'm going to go and try it in-store first so that I can work out which palette I want. (All of them, obvs.)   Thanks for sharing!! :-)"
AustralianMakeup,2wz1gf,felix9213,8,Tue Feb 24 09:23:02 2015 UTC,"Actually, it's more like $54USD->$69AUD without US taxes (or with a 7% US tax $57.78USD->73.82 if you buy in the US). Remember that Mecca has to add 10% GST for all goods sold in Australia, so that would bring the $69AUD up to $75.90AUD. So I think the price is reasonable too... And that Naked 2 palette will be mine!"
AustralianMakeup,2wz1gf,WarlockPanda,3,Tue Feb 24 22:35:58 2015 UTC,Oh yes even better!! I love the Naked 2 :-) it's so pretty! I'm getting the original Naked 1 to complete my collection :-)
AustralianMakeup,2wz1gf,DarkPhoenix1993,1 point,Wed Feb 25 04:19:27 2015 UTC,The Naked 1 is wonderful. I wasn't 100% sold on it when I first got it because I am not a neutral person but I love it for a more tame/work appropriate look.
AustralianMakeup,2wz1gf,WarlockPanda,2,Wed Feb 25 22:54:45 2015 UTC,"Ahhh, that's even better. Yay for reasonableness! :-)"
AustralianMakeup,2wz1gf,felix9213,10,Tue Feb 24 23:32:09 2015 UTC,"I was just about to post this!! $80 is pretty decent given GST and all that. I already have Naked 2&3, so I'll be getting the original Naked palette and maybe a lipstick?   Any suggestions about other products I should get? I've only ever tried the Naked and Naked Basics palettes!"
AustralianMakeup,2wz1gf,DarkPhoenix1993,3,Tue Feb 24 09:21:08 2015 UTC,Oooh I want to get the naked basics palette. Will probably be my first Aussie urban decay purchase :)
AustralianMakeup,2wz1gf,DarkPhoenix1993,3,Tue Feb 24 09:51:15 2015 UTC,"i LIVE for my basics palette, I highly recommend it!"
AustralianMakeup,2wz1gf,One_of_a_Kind,3,Tue Feb 24 13:36:45 2015 UTC,I love my Naked Basics!! It's the perfect travel palette and the shades are so buttery and glide into your skin. Plus you get 6 very versatile shades to do different looks with. I have both Naked Basics 1&2 - I probably prefer the Naked Basics 2 a bit more but they're both amazing!
AustralianMakeup,2wz1gf,Sleiphy,1 point,Tue Feb 24 21:01:10 2015 UTC,"UD Naked Basics is my most used palette, I love it. I've used it most work days since I got it in September last year and there's barely a dent in any of the shadows."
AustralianMakeup,2wz1gf,stephidermis,2,Wed Feb 25 21:22:30 2015 UTC,I personally love their lipsticks and lipliners - I'd definitely get a couple of those. Rapture and manic are particularly nice. The Naked Flushed palettes are really nice if they work well with your complexion.  I have Native and the bronzer is a little bit dark but I like the blush and highlighter.
AustralianMakeup,2wz1gf,DarkPhoenix1993,3,Tue Feb 24 09:59:25 2015 UTC,"This is a good price, cheaper than what the palettes are retailing for on Beauty Bay at the moment.  I still think that compared to certain other like-brands UD palettes are worth the outlay.  I just hope they make the palettes available online.  As someone who lives in Tassie (land of no Mecca) this would make me very happy."
AustralianMakeup,2wz1gf,szarkasm,3,Wed Feb 25 09:01:45 2015 UTC,"Aw :-( you need a Mecca there! If you'd really like something, let me know - I'll be at my local Mecca the morning UD comes out so I'd be happy to pick something up for you!"
AustralianMakeup,2wz1gf,gospursgo_,3,Wed Feb 25 11:42:12 2015 UTC,"Honestly if you try post on AussieMakeupExchange or even here for a request, I'm sure lots of people would offer to pick you up one too. We all know the pain of almost-impossible-to-get-items-at-ridiculous-prices just because of geography, and if the rest of the country gets it there's no reason you shouldn't either!"
AustralianMakeup,2wz1gf,elaboratekicks,6,Wed Feb 25 12:40:18 2015 UTC,"Price is reasonable, i think the problem is going to be stock availability? :( hopefully they can handle the demand!"
AustralianMakeup,2wz1gf,elaboratekicks,5,Tue Feb 24 10:06:23 2015 UTC,I already assume the more cult products of the UD range to be gone real fast to be honest…
AustralianMakeup,2wz1gf,DarkPhoenix1993,3,Tue Feb 24 10:22:28 2015 UTC,The sales person at Mecca in Melbourne Central said they are expecting a  huge queue and people camping overnight. It'll be interesting if that is the case.
AustralianMakeup,2wz1gf,szarkasm,5,Wed Feb 25 04:44:57 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I love make up and am excited to be able to better access and test UD products here in Australia, but I cannot fathom why you would camp out for something like this."
AustralianMakeup,2wz1gf,Segat1,2,Wed Feb 25 09:39:07 2015 UTC,Neither can I! I don't understand why people would camp out for anything.  I'm going to buy Urban Decay stuff but I'm going to do it in my own sweet time. I've waited this long I can't wait a few weeks longer _^
AustralianMakeup,2wz1gf,DarkPhoenix1993,2,Wed Feb 25 11:03:24 2015 UTC,"If it was a limited edition thing, I'd sort of understand. But we're always going to have this stuff now! (Yaaaaay). No need to sleep on the streets to get it in my opinion."
AustralianMakeup,2wz1gf,sydneysomething,3,Wed Feb 25 11:13:53 2015 UTC,Agreed. I've asked for my RDO on that day so I can be there when it opens but I'm certainly not camping out! If I don't get it on that day I can wait a bit longer.
AustralianMakeup,2wz1gf,faithlessdisciple,8,Wed Feb 25 11:39:53 2015 UTC,"Ouch. I could never justify spending $80 on a single palette, especially one as overhyped as the UD Naked palette."
AustralianMakeup,2wz1gf,nixedreamer,1 point,Tue Feb 24 10:29:29 2015 UTC,What would you buy with $80 for a single palette instead?
AustralianMakeup,2wz1gf,faithlessdisciple,1 point,Wed Feb 25 12:38:36 2015 UTC,Inglot Freedom System.

AustralianMakeup,2wz1gf,BBQsauceBel,6,Tue Feb 24 09:13:46 2015 UTC,And here I was in target the other day considering buying all the Chi Chi ones for around the same price.
AustralianMakeup,2wz1gf,One_of_a_Kind,4,Tue Feb 24 09:21:03 2015 UTC,Yeah I know the price isn't so hot :-/ it's a bit less than BeautyBay though!
AustralianMakeup,2x3r2g,score1fortheprincess,10,Wed Feb 25 12:01:23 2015 UTC,No - I would never expect anything additional. I received what I ordered and that's good enough for me.
AustralianMakeup,2x3r2g,innocuous_username,3,Wed Feb 25 23:51:24 2015 UTC,"No, I don't think it's necessary and I wouldn't expect something extra."
AustralianMakeup,2x3r2g,hypothesise,1 point,Thu Feb 26 06:57:47 2015 UTC,Yeah. When I think about it I agree. But I just expected more. Maybe indie companies have spoilt me.
AustralianMakeup,2x3r2g,Tonkie,1 point,Thu Feb 26 07:22:17 2015 UTC,I think it also  depends on if the original order would have had samples in it. Some companies just don't do them?

AustralianMakeup,2wzhir,pootlepower,6,Tue Feb 24 13:30:44 2015 UTC,"Australis Fresh and Flawless pressed powder. I've been raving up and down this sub about this so sorry to repeat myself, but damn. Face of Australia blushes, Hello Dolly is my matte winter go-to and O Peachy! is my summer sparkles. Pretty amazing colour payoff for the pricepoint.  Garnier Miracle Skin Perfecter BB Cream in the long bottle, not the short one. DO NOT MIX THEM UP. LONG BOTTLE ONLY. Colour range is shit but if you have dry skin this stuff is perfect to layer under foundation to prevent it turning your dermis into a desert."
AustralianMakeup,2wzhir,pootlepower,1 point,Tue Feb 24 14:02:12 2015 UTC,that's a translucent powder right? I'm actually running low in my elf one so I might give it a go.   I don't have any Face of Australia products so i'll check them out instore.
AustralianMakeup,2wzhir,trignometry,5,Tue Feb 24 22:49:58 2015 UTC,"Fresh and Flawless is a coloured powder, apparently a very accurate dupe for Mac Studio Fix. The translucent is the Ready Set Go loose powder, I personally get more joy out of the Elf one but other people rave about it. The packaging is certainly a lot better, though."
AustralianMakeup,2wzhir,Bebbygoose,4,Wed Feb 25 00:39:40 2015 UTC,"The Australis one is soooo much better than the elf one, the only problem with it is the packaging when the product gets into the screw bit of the cap it can be impossible to open! and then I usually end up spilling some when I do get it open. I haven't seen anyone else complain about this, so maybe it's just me?"
AustralianMakeup,2wzhir,Ienjoylongwalks,3,Tue Feb 24 23:25:31 2015 UTC,"Definitely not just you, the struggle is real to open that sucker daily!"
AustralianMakeup,2wzhir,pootlepower,1 point,Wed Feb 25 07:56:26 2015 UTC,What is the difference between the short and long bottle? Thanks :)
AustralianMakeup,2wzhir,Ienjoylongwalks,1 point,Fri Feb 27 05:20:08 2015 UTC,"It just seems like a totally different product. The short bottle stuff (for me) had barely any coverage, felt oily, seemed to sit on top of my skin rather than blending it and clung to my dry bits. The long bottle has much better coverage and blends very well, it does need to be set with a powder but it is a lot less oily feeling. But I'm just reading some reviews of the short bottle and looks like a lot of people like it, so each to their own."

AustralianMakeup,2wzhir,hellebora,7,Fri Feb 27 07:28:14 2015 UTC,"I actually made a video on this just before the 40% off sale, but can't remember all the products mentioned, so my latest favourites have been:   Australis Velourlips - I jumped on this bandwagon pretty late, but Mi-A-Mee is so freaking beautiful. Australis Fresh & Flawless powder - Terrible colour range, but one of the only products that keeps me matte for longer than 2 minutes! Australis Cray For Colour Jumbo Eye Pencils - Literally the BEST THING I have EVER used.  You like NYX? Well, these are better! No creasing, no smudging, and just beautiful to work with! Essence mascaras - So cheap and so amazing.  My favourite is I Love Volume Crazy Extreme, but I've heard the Lash Princess one is also pretty good. Face of Australia Lip Quench Lipsticks - Peaches & Cream is my ""MLBB"" shade and I really really enjoy the texture of these.  Forbidden Fruit is also pretty amazing (A really beautiful berry shade) Savvy Classic Blushes - AMAZING. They're only $4.99 and holy shit, AMAZING.  I have 3 now, because they're so bloody amazing. Model's Prefer brushes - Really any of them, but they're really good quality for the price, especially the Airbrush Foundation Brush (it's similar to the Real Techniques Expert Face Brush or Buffing Brush or something??) so good.   (I only buy cruelty free makeup, so sorry I didn't mention anything from other brands!)"
AustralianMakeup,2wzhir,pumpkinspicevodka,3,Wed Feb 25 03:30:57 2015 UTC,"I use the Sukin and DermaSukin skincare ranges, and there's always the Maybelline Master Precise Liquid Liner, and the Full and Soft mascara.

AustralianMakeup,2wzhir,BBQsauceBel,2,Wed Feb 25 08:39:33 2015 UTC,Mine:   Savvy Pressed Mineral powder (omg this is so cheap and so good! Especially if you like light coverage because you can wear this alone) L'Oreal Nutri Shine lipsticks (I like these much better than Revlon Lip butters) Essence clear mascara (for my brows)   And then there's skincare and haircare. That's a whole other story! I can easily spend $20! :D
AustralianMakeup,2wzhir,crossesafimelb,1 point,Wed Feb 25 00:38:00 2015 UTC,ahaha i know it's so easy to spend $20! I'm super interested in what everyone's in to at the moment so thanks for your suggestions - I don't have anything by savvy so I'll give it a look
AustralianMakeup,2wzhir,stephidermis,2,Wed Feb 25 00:40:46 2015 UTC,I think we might have similar colouring so you should do ok with the lightest shade in the Savvy powder. Be sure it's the mineral one. It's really lovely because the minerals end up looking really natural on the skin after it has settled. I apply with a flocked sponge but it's ok with a kabuki. This is my go-to product on rushed mornings!
AustralianMakeup,2wzhir,icicle_,2,Wed Feb 25 00:47:16 2015 UTC,"Australis pearl mineral high lights, I use it quite often."
AustralianMakeup,2wzhir,alleeexxxx,2,Wed Feb 25 12:43:05 2015 UTC,Maybelline Master Precise liquid eyeliner is awesome for the price & CG Clump Crusher is my favourite cheapie mascara.
AustralianMakeup,2wzhir,icicle_,2,Fri Feb 27 09:18:42 2015 UTC,Maybelline age rewind concealer in dark circles. Honestly one of the best concealers I've tried!

AustralianMakeup,2wzmji,Lingamae,6,Tue Feb 24 14:04:22 2015 UTC,I would recommend trying Revlon balm stains. You can usually find them on sale at most chemists/priceline if you keep a look out.
AustralianMakeup,2wzmji,WarlockPanda,1 point,Tue Feb 24 22:44:42 2015 UTC,Thanks! Going to go check them out this week.
AustralianMakeup,2wzmji,neodeone,2,Wed Feb 25 10:50:52 2015 UTC,"you'll probably like the new Rimmel provocalips, I wore a dark red one on valentines day that last through dinner and smooching with no transfer and it still looked great by the end of the night. the do need an oil based remover though."

AustralianMakeup,2wzmji,dancepantz,2,Wed Feb 25 10:51:23 2015 UTC,Nars audacious for something a little less flat.  A bit on the exxy side but they are quite nice.
AustralianMakeup,2wzmji,sigorette,2,Wed Feb 25 09:03:17 2015 UTC,"I'll definitely have a look, if they are pricey maybe just one or two for special occasions. A girls gotta have sexy lips!"
AustralianMakeup,2wzmji,icicle_,1 point,Wed Feb 25 10:52:49 2015 UTC,Seconding Nars Audacious. Pricey but definitely worth it!
AustralianMakeup,2wz3hu,Touchwood,12,Tue Feb 24 09:40:18 2015 UTC,"Chichi's eyeshadows are amazing quality for the price point. I just wish they'd fix their stupid branding. It's obviously made for tween girls, and the packaging looks awful and cheap. Elf have the same pricepoint but have decentish/legit looking branding and packaging."
AustralianMakeup,2wz3hu,DarkPhoenix1993,5,Tue Feb 24 11:01:47 2015 UTC,"I agree. I'd buy more Chi Chi if packaging was nicer. It's looks so cheap and turns me off buying it, which is disappointing because I hear so many good things about them but whenever I go to buy them I think 'if I spend a little bit more I can get something much nicer'. Plus the only product I've tried had very dry eyeshadows that were hard to pick up on my brush :-/"
AustralianMakeup,2wz3hu,scusememiss,1 point,Tue Feb 24 21:09:19 2015 UTC,This is the reason why I have never bought Chi Chi. Glad to know I'm not the only one!
AustralianMakeup,2wz3hu,MsOrangeCake,5,Sat Feb 28 08:50:11 2015 UTC,"I find their branding at odds with their price point :/ The branding seems to put them between Australis and Essence, but the price is higher than Australis. At times I think their branding seems at war with itself - the turkish delight smell and suede-feeling plastic with the damask print on their lipstick seems more expensive to me, but then the prominent Chi Chi logo on it has these unbearably twee lip shapes for tittles, and logo font looks like something I would've picked in a Computers class in year 8. I've also noticed now that the newer lipsticks are coming out with a sweet bubblegum scent, which makes them seem even younger."
AustralianMakeup,2wz3hu,madefromrain,4,Wed Feb 25 10:56:08 2015 UTC,"It would depend on your store grading. My store is an A grade in cosmetics and we aren't reducing the chi chi range as I just spoke to the chi chi rep today, just some select products being discontinued (metallic eyeliners, eye crayons, glitter eyeliners and some colours of lip products). This is normal because of new products being released."
AustralianMakeup,2wz3hu,DelusionRoulette,5,Tue Feb 24 11:41:57 2015 UTC,Target employee here. I'm nearly 100% sure we aren't changing the line up. Usually what's put out on the floor is what's being delivered. We may just have more NYX products this month.   Disclaimer: My ideas do not officially represent Target at all. Don't sue me I'm a cashier.
AustralianMakeup,2wz3hu,originalaliswan,3,Wed Feb 25 07:37:43 2015 UTC,"Well I know Chi Chi have discontinued their eyeshadow quads - so if that's the cut down you're referring to, that's on Chi Chi not Target.   My local Target already expanded their NYX range months ago, and didn't cut back any Chi Chi to allow for it :)  I really want to like Chi Chi... But I get more misses than hits from them that's for sure. Their lipsticks are an awful formula with a horrid rose scent. And the eyeshadow palettes are chalky af and do. not. blend. :( I have one shimmery pink baked eyeshadow that I enjoy, and that's about it."
AustralianMakeup,2wz3hu,DarkPhoenix1993,2,Tue Feb 24 14:00:34 2015 UTC,Same. So chalky and disappointing :-/

AustralianMakeup,2wz3hu,jamballdonut,1 point,Tue Feb 24 23:57:16 2015 UTC,They're expanding now and still not bringing the liquid concealer? This annoys me so much. (I asked recently in the nyx Facebook page when we could expect their liquid concealer wand and they said they weren't bringing to our market :/ )
AustralianMakeup,2wz3hu,ohhforfoxsake,1 point,Tue Feb 24 11:08:39 2015 UTC,"I remember NYX announcing on Facebook that they were expanding their range, and my local Target did do some move-arounds.  But, instead of cutting back on Chi Chi, they cut back on NP Set, and moved some Chi Chi products to the ends of aisles instead.  Does your store have that or are those products just completely gone?"
AustralianMakeup,2wznw5,pootlepower,15,Tue Feb 24 14:17:12 2015 UTC,"There's not really a set name here, I have noticed a few people get their knickers in a knot about it being used on this sub (which I think is a little ridiculous, there's absolutely no need to take a shot at somebody over the use of the term) but personally I couldn't care less. Everyone knows what it means and it is so widely used that it's just the first word that comes to mind for a lot of people."
AustralianMakeup,2wznw5,Jessijames,5,Tue Feb 24 21:26:30 2015 UTC,"I agree, I automatically assume that when someone on this sub uses the word 'drugstore' that they mean low end products, as will most people who browse the other makeup subs. I don't think we should take a hatchet to those users who use the term."
AustralianMakeup,2wznw5,WarlockPanda,7,Tue Feb 24 22:41:16 2015 UTC,I just call it makeup. And call the more expensive/prestige items high-end makeup.
AustralianMakeup,2wznw5,score1fortheprincess,14,Wed Feb 25 03:18:14 2015 UTC,"I just say available at Priceline. The word drugstore really irritates me, it sounds like I'm going to walk into a shady pharmacy with drug deals going on everywhere.   Edit to say we definitely shouldn't be denigrating people who prefer the term drugstore. It's all a matter of personal preference, I think!"
AustralianMakeup,2wznw5,criticalenemy,4,Tue Feb 24 20:01:38 2015 UTC,That's exactly why it rubs me up the wrong way. It's like taking makup addiction to a whole new level.

AustralianMakeup,2wznw5,missb00,3,Tue Feb 24 14:54:01 2015 UTC,"The issue is that our lower-end products cost almost as much as mid-end. I wait for the day I can get a Revlon pencil for $8, hnng."
AustralianMakeup,2wznw5,MessyDownunder,3,Wed Feb 25 04:09:17 2015 UTC,"I just say drugstore. I know it didn't originate here, but that's kinda how language works. It has been appropriated because U.S. English has one word to describe something we can only use multiple words to describe. I figure it's the same as 'schadenfreude' or 'faux pas'.   The other option is 'low end', but personally that makes me think of crappier than drugstore - like the random brands you find in The Reject Shop."

AustralianMakeup,2wzld7,lalafancy,6,Tue Feb 24 13:52:04 2015 UTC,"Some great Aussie brands:   Australis - My favourites are their Velourlips (Matte lip creams), Cray For Colour Jumbo Eye Pencils (Really amazing, don't crease or smudge, and work beautifully under shadows), their Fresh & Flawless powder (Terrible colour range, but keeps me matte for ages!) Face of Australia - Lip Quench Lipsticks (Nothing too amazing, but I really enjoy them for the price), their liquid illuminators (Very popular, and you get HEAPS of product for the price). Savvy by DB - This is a ""cheap"" brand, but they have some really great products.  My favourites are their classic blushes, which are absolutely amazing for the price.  Their face powders are also pretty good too, I use one of the darker shades to contour. Model's Prefer - I've recently been getting more into this brand, so haven't tried many products by them, but I've heard really good things about their Soft Touch Powder (I think it's called!) which is apparently a pretty good dupe of the Hourglass Ambient Lighting Powders. Designer Brands - This is the ""parent"" brand of Savvy, and they do some pretty decent products (Although they're fairly cheap too).  I've heard their oil free foundation and mineral whipped shadows are good. Ulta3 - Heard so many good things about their lipsticks.  They're inexpensive, creamy, and last a decent amount of time. Chi Chi - Their lipsticks and eyeshadows are amazing.  I recently bought one of their single baked eyeshadows and COMPLETELY fell in love with it.  It's absolutely amazing, and greatly pigmented and just beautiful to work with.   I can't think of any others, but I'll edit this if I do! :)"
AustralianMakeup,2wzld7,jamballdonut,2,Wed Feb 25 03:36:25 2015 UTC,"I second Chi Chi! Probably my favourite brand, haha. Their eyeshadow singles are so amazing, their Glamorous palettes aren't half bad either. Pigmentation is good with good texture. The price point is a bit more expensive than the ""drugstore"" brands, but I feel like the quality is so worth buying.   Also, the Nudes palette is a dupe for Naked 2."
AustralianMakeup,2wzld7,icicle_,1 point,Wed Feb 25 15:36:26 2015 UTC,"I think it's a dupe for Naked 1, not #2. But it's AMAZING!"
AustralianMakeup,2wzld7,lanadelghey,4,Thu Feb 26 06:43:33 2015 UTC,"The only other ones that I think are exclusive to Australia that haven't been mentioned is Face of Australia and Nude by Nature (an all natural brand). I like the illuminators from both. The Angel's Kiss one from FoA is a spot on dupe of High Beam from Benefit, you get more product and it smells better."
AustralianMakeup,2wzld7,BlissAbyss,3,Tue Feb 24 15:48:39 2015 UTC,"The only Australian brand I can think of atm that I've tried is Australis. Their Fresh and Flawless Powder is highly touted on this subreddit and I personally quite like it. Their finishing powder is also recommended but imho it's not that distinguishable to be a 'must have' product. I frickin' love their lipsticks but they have an amazing range of Velourlips (matte lip cream) which are pretty mint. If there was a limit of one product from this brand, I'd definitely recommend the Velourlips."
AustralianMakeup,2wzld7,bitch_is_cray_cray,2,Tue Feb 24 14:16:51 2015 UTC,I just researched these and these look great! I love the colour range too! Will definitely get these. Thank you :)
AustralianMakeup,2wzld7,MsOrangeCake,1 point,Tue Feb 24 15:38:16 2015 UTC,"I like jamballdonut's suggestions, except for the ulta3 lipsticks, because I had a lot of problems with the pigmentation with their testers, but with testers it's hard to tell if they're old stock or not.  Nude by Nature is the best-selling foundation in Priceline, but their shade range is limited if you're darker.  Have a look around chemists for the brand Neon Cosmetics. They smell exactly like the Face of Australia lipsticks and are also made in Australia - I suspect that they're made in the same factory. However they cost $3 less at ~$5 each. No. 21 is my perfect MLBB shade (I'm mestiza)."
AustralianMakeup,2wzld7,pondicus,1 point,Wed Feb 25 11:18:36 2015 UTC,"Not a makeup brand, but Sukin is a really great budget skincare brand. Their products are pretty sweet for what they are and good value too."

AustralianMakeup,2wz7hc,jamballdonut,1 point,Tue Feb 24 11:06:43 2015 UTC,"It's okay. Quite shimmery, nice and smooth. Not heavily pigmented, which is kind of what I was hoping as it's a darkish colour in the jar. It's not quite as slippery as a cream. Like a soft gel.  They stopped selling these years ago, I think I must have bought one of the last brand new ones in Australia."
AustralianMakeup,2wz7hc,faithlessdisciple,1 point,Tue Feb 24 11:13:41 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how much I'd trust this product, tbh.  I bought one back in June, and then found out that these products were discontinued in around 2011/2012 (I think?) and they're very prone to infection/mold or something.  I dunno, I can't remember exact details, but I binned mine instantly after reading it, because I didn't wanna take the risk (Mine was sealed the same as yours when I bought it, and I never actually used it, but it just didn't look right).  Just thought I'd let you know! :)"
AustralianMakeup,2wz7hc,faithlessdisciple,2,Tue Feb 24 11:26:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks!

AustralianMakeup,2wrcdh,Ienjoylongwalks,2,Fri Feb 27 07:25:52 2015 UTC,MMP is my to to everyday eyeliner before I got the mac gel eyeliner. It applies smoother and darker than any other eyeliner pen. I rip through one about every six weeks before it loses it's colour. I'll have to check out stay all day. Is the tip as soft and pliable as MMP?  I find the stiff felt ones hard to apply.
AustralianMakeup,2wrcdh,originalaliswan,1 point,Fri Feb 27 09:47:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah MMP has been my HG since it first appeared yeeears ago, but I've been getting into high ends and SSAD seemed to be the easiest to use based on what I already use.

AustralianMakeup,2wnp9q,magickmidget,2,Sun Feb 22 05:49:04 2015 UTC,"I realise you probably want to know about makeup, but I cannot push their Wellness and Orange Blossom body products enough. So lovely!  As for makeup, my big issue is range being a pale ginger lady. I did buy the lightest mineral powder and occasionally use it as contour. I quite like the Bronzer/Enhancer in Warm Day and pressed power though.   Their mechanical eyeliner is great for smudging... but not so great for normal lining. Despite being waterproof, it moves a lot. I didn't much love their waterproof mascara either - a lot of flaking.  What I do love is their lip products. The lip crayons are GORGEOUS (I have 3/5 of them and use them all regularly) and their lipstick in Delight is my go-to in winter."

AustralianMakeup,2wnp9q,Flippantry,1 point,Mon Feb 23 05:53:12 2015 UTC,ah stink :-( I haven't found mine does that too much though I guess I use a bit more than when I used a stippling brush. Have you found a sponge you like?
AustralianMakeup,2wnp9q,Booboo_the_bear,1 point,Mon Feb 23 06:02:13 2015 UTC,"I found mine really depends on what foundation I'm using, and how wet it is. Obviously dry is no good, but if you thoroughly wet it under a stream while pumping it with your hand to get it fully wet all the way through and then squeeze the majority of the water out. I've found Mac studio fluid fix and YSL Touche éclat work really well with the sponge, not so much Elizabeth Arden flawless finish"
AustralianMakeup,2wnp9q,Artemisian11,2,Tue Feb 24 04:33:46 2015 UTC,"I've tried their liquid foundation, the formula itself is alright but the shades don't go very light, I use it to contour instead haha.  Their ""Young"" skincare range for oily/combination skin is decent, I used the gel cleanser and moisturiser for a while, pretty good value for money.  The foundation sponge was a waste of money."

AustralianMakeup,2wlrfr,scusememiss,9,Fri Feb 20 23:57:03 2015 UTC,"I use Kevyn Aucoin Volumizing from Mecca... I loveeeeeee the formula. Washing my face at night is my least favourite thing to do ever (but I still do it, every damn day) - this mascara makes that process soooooo much faster and nicer. No smudging! Ever! Just wipes off with warm water. I freaking LOVE it. I won't be able to go back to a standard formula mascara.  That being said, it doesnt do much in the way of volume. Its lengthening and makes my lashes darker and defined, but if you're after something big and dramatic Kevyn won't be able to help.  If you do find a big amazing dramatic tubular mascara that can do it all. Please let me know!"
AustralianMakeup,2wlrfr,tulipsandpolish,2,Sat Feb 21 00:39:34 2015 UTC,"I LOVE KA's mascara. both the volumizing and lengthening. they are my HG's and I will never buy anything else. last all day without flaking or smudging in the slightest. yet it slips right off in warm water. they are truly worth every penny, can't recommend it enough!"
AustralianMakeup,2wlrfr,sickwiththejillness,2,Sat Feb 21 22:27:21 2015 UTC,Yes! The washing off thing is what sold me as well. I completely stopped wearing mascara for ages because I hated having to take it off at night but tubing mascara (I use Blinc) has revolutionised my mascara wearing - I can wear it again!
AustralianMakeup,2wlrfr,hazelbot,2,Sat Feb 21 03:22:03 2015 UTC,I was cruelly looking at the Kevin aucoin stuff today on the website and now I'm really curious to try...I wish they had more of the K.A. Stuff
AustralianMakeup,2wlrfr,sydneysomething,1 point,Sat Feb 21 09:10:51 2015 UTC,I haven't used mascara in ages now and the skin around my eyes is much clearer. I hated the flaking and cleaning each night. I will shop around to find the perfect one. I did read you can keep reapplying it and your lashes will become more voluminous.

AustralianMakeup,2wlrfr,fecktopia,3,Mon Feb 23 05:30:46 2015 UTC,"L'Oréal double extend beauty tubes is pretty good. I love that it flakes off with warm water, and absolutely no smudging during wear. It does definitely lengthens and adds a decent bit of volume but I'm very liberal in the application, because as long as you work quick between coats it doesn't clump. The L'Oréal also gives a nice, rich, almost glossy black colour that I like and the whole effect actually opens up my eyes rather than weighing it down like a lot of mascaras can. I love it."
AustralianMakeup,2wlrfr,muchmadeup,1 point,Sat Feb 21 01:47:36 2015 UTC,"I'm so excited about this now. I was thinking of trying MAC. I'll do more reading about it. I would live to waltz into Myer and do to the counters, but I doubt they'd really be any more help. It might get confusing."
AustralianMakeup,2wlrfr,carnageincminor,2,Sat Feb 21 04:27:51 2015 UTC,"I did! At first I didn't realize it was a tubing mascara- didn't even realize that such thing existed! I got it in the sample bag from Nordstrom, it was Laura Mercier I believe, put it on, went on with my day not thinking about it, and when it came to taking it off in the evening I FREAKED OUT because I though my lashes were coming out!! Silly me had to google the mascara to find out why it was sliding off my eyelashes like snake skin. I am not a huge fan, but I do appreciate that there is zero flaking and easy cleanup. Didn't do much for me in terms of volume, and little in terms of length."
AustralianMakeup,2wlrfr,jamballdonut,1 point,Sat Feb 21 00:25:07 2015 UTC,I think it would have freaked anyone out!! Damn. I'm hoping for length too as I had extension lashes put in awhile ago which was the biggest mistake. I'm still waiting for my eyelashes to grow back..
AustralianMakeup,2wlrfr,carnageincminor,2,Sat Feb 21 04:16:25 2015 UTC,"How well does a tubing mascara hold up a curl, for someone with straight lashes? I hate the removal process for waterproof mascara but I put up with it because it's the best thing I've tried that holds up a curl."
AustralianMakeup,2wlrfr,faithlessdisciple,2,Sat Feb 21 04:21:45 2015 UTC,"My lashes hate holding a curl, and the Australis one works fairly well.  My outer lashes always end up drooping after an hour or so, but they hold up better than some of my other mascaras!"

I basically went the nearest drugstore and just dumped whatever caught my eye into my basket! Haha   He smells so good! Me and my friends were desperately on the lookout for some more Korean brands (we only found one Tony Moly store in Ikebukuro) so we became crazy when we stumbled across Etude House and others when we were at the airport haha!   Definitely agree with you about CANMAKE being one of the good drugstore brands!  They also had a really nice plum coloured cream blush, however I couldn't find it in store, shame!   I also really liked the Kate Tokyo products as well. Their slim gel eyeliner pencil is sooo good. Smudgeproof, waterproof and so easy to use, perfect for when I'm lazy.   and my trip was definitely AMAZING! I already miss Japan so much! Definitely am determined to go there again soon.  ugh yes Japanese food, I could go on and on about it... I'm tempted to even attach an album of the food I ate to this comment (I love food too much) ... so yum and so cheap! Especially Family Mart! How it saved me from those midnight cravings."
AustralianMakeup,2wiuve,DoYourSquats,17,Fri Feb 20 06:31:52 2015 UTC,"/u/brownbabe makes some good points although maybe it's just the store near me but Cosmetica isn't predominantly skincare, if anything it's much more 50/50 in both.  From speaking with staff at Meccas they're definitely marketed and geared towards different audiences more than anything. Cosmetica has most of the highest/higher end brands, and is marketed to a more mature aged audience.   Maxima I think is geared much more towards 20s & 30s - they have a good mix of 'funky fresh' brands and still some of the higher end, but the store styling and atmosphere is much more suited for a younger audience. Somebody say my Mum's age (mid-50s) would possibly feel a little out of place in a Maxima, but much more comfortable in a Cosmetica. Also another reason why when Urban Decay becomes available it will be in Maxima rather than Cosmetica - from a target marketing point of view it makes more sense.  Their 3rd store brand is Kit that I think is again geared towards a much younger audience, teenagers and those in their 20s. The branding is much more 'kid-like' with bright colours and loud patterns with again brands that would appeal more to a younger audience.  Of course, in saying this that doesn't mean that somebody whose 18 can't shop in a Cosmetica - that would be silly! But I definitely can see & understand the different levels of branding appeal and IMO it's a smart move. They can position whichever of the 3 suits the area the most. For example, Chadstone is a quite high-end sophisticated shopping centre here in Melbourne and therefore have a Cosmetica. Myer stores tend to have a Kit in them as a counter, there aren't many standalone Kit stores if any."

I'm level 1 too:   Ciate polish in Amazing Gracie Deluxe sample of Nars Light Optimising Primer - would have loved the Hourglass :( Same Verso serum (I have never heard of this brand before?) Sachet of Kate Somerville Multi Active Repair Eye Cream

AustralianMakeup,2weoxc,Jessijames,1 point,Fri Feb 20 04:42:27 2015 UTC,hypothesise - did you go to Cosmetica or Maxima (not sure if it matters anymore though)? I've received so many samples of the Hourglass Primer (and it doesn't agree with my skin) so I'm hoping to get the Nars Primer instead in my Level 1 box!
AustralianMakeup,2weoxc,Professional_Student,1 point,Fri Feb 20 04:41:16 2015 UTC,Maxima in Southland.
AustralianMakeup,2weoxc,hypothesise,1 point,Fri Feb 20 07:55:24 2015 UTC,"Good. That is how it should have been from the start. It was stupid that the boxes were different. And I am not just talking from Maxima and Cosmetica, I got multiple boxes that said I was supposed to get something on the card, and got something else instead (There were also a couple of times where I got items that were in the level 2 box when I was level 3 as a replacement for a missing item in the level 3 box). It was majorly disappointing, especially when I would go to Cosmetica or Maxima based on what I saw people were getting from each box."
AustralianMakeup,2weoxc,WarlockPanda,1 point,Fri Feb 20 02:24:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah definitely, I like the idea of it being the same it makes so much sense. I am close to both a Cosmetica & a Maxima so having it universal makes the choice easy!"
AustralianMakeup,2weoxc,Jessijames,1 point,Fri Feb 20 02:47:41 2015 UTC,"I have no problem with the ""same item - different colours"" because I can still base my decision on that. Whereas variability between products in the boxes given out at the same store sucks."

Doesn't come with glue though) Korres fig shower gel (sachet) Sunday Riley good genes treatment (sachet) Kate sommerville self tan towelette (which I'll never use since I'm medium skin toned already) Kate sommerville deep tissue repair moisturizer (sachet)
AustralianMakeup,2weoxc,SEXPILUS,2,Fri Feb 20 06:17:59 2015 UTC,I'm a Level 2 as well and my box is the same as yours. The falsies are quite nice and I'm excited to use my Sunday Riley sample but the rest of it I feel pretty apathetic about. I've liked past boxes more and I feel RIDICULOUS griping about a free sample box but 😐 Hopefully we get some of the cool stuff next month (or we move up a level between now and then 😛)

Only decently priced products in my opinion are the shower gels (almost no stock left/very limited scents) and Kat Von D...maybe a few concealers.

AustralianMakeup,2war3x,kitz_bambi,6,Wed Feb 18 10:04:20 2015 UTC,I love love love my matte lipstick in whipped caviar. The only problem with it is I went to get a backup I couldn't find any stock..
AustralianMakeup,2war3x,ellie_girl,3,Wed Feb 18 10:36:21 2015 UTC,I think they're a great formula but I ended up selling mine on AMUE because it was juuust too cool for me.
AustralianMakeup,2war3x,MsOrangeCake,3,Thu Feb 19 02:55:29 2015 UTC,I suppose I'm just the right shade of pale for it :) it's only slightly darker than my natural lip colour which may be the reason I love it so much.  I still look for it in every target I go into.
AustralianMakeup,2war3x,ellie_girl,3,Thu Feb 19 05:17:19 2015 UTC,Yeah I had that problem with Eurotrash!
AustralianMakeup,2war3x,onehungrydinosaur,2,Thu Feb 19 03:51:39 2015 UTC,Its been possibly the most used lipstick I've had. Even though I've jumped on the velourlips bandwagon it's still one of my favourite neutral lip colours.
AustralianMakeup,2war3x,ellie_girl,3,Thu Feb 19 05:13:45 2015 UTC,I'm the same as you! I've only hair gotten into the NYX brand but since my first purchase I swear I've bought half the stand at target! Some people rag on it cause it's not high end but damn it works so well for me
AustralianMakeup,2war3x,PoleL0ver,3,Wed Feb 18 10:09:27 2015 UTC,"I adore Nyx. I've never been game enough to wear bold lip colours, but I wore one of the matte lip creams I'd bought ages ago and it stayed put literally all day. I've always had trouble with lip colours bleeding, fading and drying out my lips but this one, even throughout lunch didn't budge. It was awesome."
AustralianMakeup,2war3x,cowboy_dog,3,Wed Feb 18 10:54:50 2015 UTC,"I like the VelourLips more, for me it seems to last longer than the NYX. And it smells like grape. <3"
AustralianMakeup,2war3x,onehungrydinosaur,2,Wed Feb 18 15:54:12 2015 UTC,"I have NYX's Transylvania, Copenhagen, and Prague and omg the formula is so lovely and easy to use. I found Transylvania to be a bit patchy but it's definitely workable with a bit more effort.   I bought Velourlips in Tok-i-o and I found the formula to be a bit... inflexible? It's fine, albeit patchy, when first applied, but if I smile or do anything that involves my mouth stretching then it shows EVERY line on my lips and more when my mouth is resting. It feels like a film on my lips, compared to NYX's soft matte lip cream which I barely notice on."
AustralianMakeup,2war3x,CinnamonBunBun,2,Wed Feb 18 12:00:09 2015 UTC,Prague is perfection! Definitely my favourite :)
AustralianMakeup,2war3x,Bulbysaur123,2,Thu Feb 19 03:52:59 2015 UTC,"I prefer the VelourLips only because they don't smell as awful as the SMLCs. Seriously, that smell is so bad."
AustralianMakeup,2w9ym7,drunkerxx,17,Wed Feb 18 04:10:48 2015 UTC,"Owner of a terrible oil pit of a face checking in;  Above & beyond the things that make the biggest differences for me in A. controlling oil & B. keeping everything in place are below (if it helps, I also work in a climate controlled office all day every day):   Starting with a clean slate in the morning & moisturising well: As awful as it sounds, I never used to wash my face in the morning unless I showered (which is rare as I prefer to shower before bed) and never moisturised EVER because I felt it just exacerbated my oiliness but now, I use a micellar water product on a cotton pad and swipe it all over my face first thing when I wake up, then moisturise and let that sink in while I do  my hair/put aside my clothes/whatever. Moisturising correctly when you have oily skin is key, I think my face used to over-produce oil as a result of not getting adequate moisture! Primer/foundation: The best advice I have ever been given that has made the biggest difference is correctly matching your primer to your foundation. If the primer you use that day is silicone based, use a silicone based foundation. Water based primer, water based foundation. I never knew this made a difference and wondered why my makeup would break down significantly worse/faster depending on which primer I use and this rule of thumb helps a hell of a lot. Finishing powder: I was always used to use pressed powders - AKA. powder that has pigment as I liked that it gave me extra coverage even though 9/10 make me go super cake face because of my oiliness. I have since introduced a properly translucent/finishing powder and it has also helped with my oiliness a great deal. If I feel I need that touch of extra coverage, I will still use a regular pressed powder lightly, do the rest of my face and then dust finishing powder all over and this is the step that helps keep my face the mattest for the longest and the least cakey. If I for whatever reason don't use a finishing powder my face is a mess by lunchtime at work no matter the temp. I finish my entire face off with a spritz of the Skindinavia oil control setting spray. Blotting: I also only ever use a translucent powder for touch-ups and MAKE. SURE. YOU. BLOT. BEFORE. TOUCHING. UP. I can't even stress how much of a difference gently blotting the oil off before re-powdering makes. It also stops transfer of oil to the brush and ultimately onto your powder pan which will eff it up (I used to have this problem bigtime.) not to mention dat hygiene. If it's a particularly hot day, I also use the same oil control setting spray from Skindinavia when I touch up, after I blot but before I re-powder. Why, you ask? That shit will dry your oil up in seconds and get rid of any oil you didn't when you blotted creating a nice re-matted canvas to then powder - sometimes I will lightly re-spritz after powder too. This spray is also handy (if you buy a travel size or have a bag big enough) if you're out & about and can't really stop to properly powder etc one spritz when you feel a bit oily and you're good to go!   I really hope at least some of this can help you, I know how much severe oiliness is a pain in the butt for makeup and I have tried 1001 'tips & tricks' from 1001 people and have found what works the best for me and hopefully for somebody else too!"
AustralianMakeup,2w9ym7,Jessijames,5,Wed Feb 18 04:34:06 2015 UTC,"This really covers just about everything I would have suggested.   Only thing I would add is don't touch your face. Just don't. I don't care if on the foundation bottle it says transfer resistant, it will fucking transfer everywhere :p"
AustralianMakeup,2w9ym7,sydneysomething,2,Wed Feb 18 05:09:57 2015 UTC,Yes! This too. Don't touch touch your face!
AustralianMakeup,2w9ym7,Jessijames,2,Wed Feb 18 05:30:59 2015 UTC,TIL about the importance of matching primer and foundation types. Very interesting!
AustralianMakeup,2w9ym7,BBQsauceBel,1 point,Wed Feb 18 07:16:57 2015 UTC,"I do the same in the AM, use my Garnier Micellear on a cotton pad and then use the Philosophy moisturizer. Maybe the problem is not using same base of primer/foundation, I'll have to try that. Oh god, have never blotted before re-applying so that's a massive help. Can you recommend a translucent powder?"
AustralianMakeup,2w9ym7,Jessijames,3,Wed Feb 18 05:08:36 2015 UTC,"I use the australis ready set go loose finishing powder in the morning and for touch ups I currently use the MAC pressed translucent powder, but yes blotting helps big time! Think about it like this, if you don't not you're just caking more powder on top of damp sticky oil. If you Blot it off you have a clean base again!"
AustralianMakeup,2w9ym7,BBQsauceBel,2,Wed Feb 18 05:30:33 2015 UTC,I really REALLY love Clarins loose translucent powder for us oily types. It comes in a very pretty jar with a delightful puff and the product lasts a long time! Worth a splurge.  But lately I have been using L'Oreal Nude Magique pressed powder. I find it very translucent. And convenient!
AustralianMakeup,2w9ym7,belbojohnhopkins,5,Wed Feb 18 07:21:44 2015 UTC,"Oily skinned lady living in the Top End checking in. It's taken me a while to get to a stage where my make up is respectable at the end of the day but here's what I do:  (I'll skip the prep part) primer - let that sink in for a while; translucent powder - Wayne Goss method; foundation mixed with a little setting spray; translucent powder; setting spray to finish.   This seems to work well for me. The thing I've noticed is if I rush and don't let the wet steps set, it seems not to work. If I take my time, it'll last. And this is in days where there's 97% humidity and I'm in and out of aircon constantly. I also found that using Shu Umera (sp?) oil face wash at night only, then just using Peter Thomas Roth face wipes in the morning seems to have calmed oil production. Hope that helps!"

I started with Missha but now use Skin79 Vip Gold. They're a total game-changer for me as I was previously just like you.   Go check out /r/AsianBeauty for recommendations. They're a friendly, helpful bunch in there!  Also don't fret about the oily skin.

The game-changer for me has been Australis Fresh and Flawless powder, although I was pretty skeptical of it at first it has really paid off. Other oily skinned people have posted about it saying it has fantastic oil control so it is worth a go. The Australis Ready Set Go didn't work for me, but is another one that other oily people swear buy. I also really like Ben Nye Neutral Set powder and Final Seal setting spray. I'm still experimenting with both but I have found using the Final Seal inbetween primer and BB cream, then on top of powder to really help. I've personally not found it so effective, but a lot of people on here recommend the Goss Method (powder first, liquid/cream foundation on top) to increase durability."
AustralianMakeup,2w9ym7,Bubbalooo,2,Wed Feb 18 07:08:18 2015 UTC,"+1 for Fresh and Flawless powder. If I'm in a rush, this one does a solid job of providing light matte coverage. Sadly though, it suffers from a lack of shades. I'd love one a tiny bit paler than the lightest shade on offer."

Make a paste out of turmeric and coconut oil and apply it to your face twice a week. Be sure to wash it off well or it will stain your skin, but it's so worth it. I put mine on for about 10 minutes, then wipe it off with a face washer. I then wait another 10-30 minutes and all my dead skin just flakes off.

I'm not a huge fan of each product individually, but together they are just fantastic!  I also just recently started using this Paula's Choice sunscreen which has given me amazing coverage, and the zinc oxide in it seems to calm down my eczema slightly. This sunscreen gives so much coverage and I don't see a single shine of oil during the day!!! My only issue is that it's a one-shade-fits-all and it's just slightly too dark for me, plus it's quite cool-toned.  I also love the Revlon ColorStay foundation. Since it can be used for a medium to high coverage, when I want a lighter coverage, I just dampen my beauty blender and apply really small dots all over my face. So far, this hasn't irritated any eczema (I've been using this for months).  Lately, I've just been wearing no makeup most days to help my skin recover, but I'm going back to uni soon too and will be definitely trying to cover everything up :P"

AustralianMakeup,2w7g0z,gospursgo_,1 point,Wed Feb 18 03:04:32 2015 UTC,"Hey  I used to have this problem too. I have extremely sensitive skin. So many products flare up my skin, especially my face. Even facial cleansers that are natural often make my skin burn. Considering my skin was so dry it would absorb the moisture from make up and flake. It didn't look good and I was so self conscious of it.   The one thing I found that helped was Burt's bees intense hydration night moisturer for sensitive skin with clarey sage. I ended up using it at night and during the day but have now bought the day cream as well.  My skin is so much better and more moisturised.  I also now use the bourjour Paris hydrating primer which is pretty good too.  My foundation doesn't really flake anymore either but I find the stila stay all day foundation to be pretty good for my skin type.  Remember that everyone's skin us different and it may take you a while to find the right routine for yourself.  Hope this helps :)"
AustralianMakeup,2w7g0z,pondicus,1 point,Wed Feb 18 06:04:38 2015 UTC,"ysl le teint touche eclat. go to myer/djs for a sample. its almost like a gel texture, no alcohol afaik, and hasnt broken out my sensitive skin. i know its expensive, but a little goes A LONG way, worth a try :)"
AustralianMakeup,2w6i3b,pootlepower,6,Tue Feb 17 10:19:04 2015 UTC,"I'm glad it worked really well for you! I heard everyone raving about this like crazy too and it did nothing but make me look like a caked on mess and didn't really control my oil much at all even with an oil control primer. Yes, I tried using less and all that jazz I just couldn't make it work for me - as well as the 'light' shade being way way too dark.  Now, the Australis Ready Set Go finishing powder on the other hand is my holy grail! I use it every damn day."
AustralianMakeup,2w6i3b,Jessijames,2,Tue Feb 17 10:52:01 2015 UTC,"Omg you are like an alternate universe me. I was so disappointed with the Ready Set Go, it made all the foundations I tried go cakey weird and pill or oxidise instantly."
AustralianMakeup,2w6i3b,Jessijames,2,Tue Feb 17 11:18:52 2015 UTC,"Hahaha so bizarre! But yes, fresh & flawless also make me oxidise - opposite twinsies!"
AustralianMakeup,2w6i3b,becabecaful,2,Tue Feb 17 11:34:34 2015 UTC,The evil one is the one with the goatee.
AustralianMakeup,2w6i3b,Jessijames,2,Tue Feb 17 12:08:14 2015 UTC,Is the finishing powder like an HD powder or just a loose translucent powder? I need a powder for setting under my eyes but the only loose one I have is ELF HD and it's not quite right.
AustralianMakeup,2w6i3b,fluffnut101,2,Tue Feb 17 11:38:50 2015 UTC,I feel like it's somewhere in the middle. it does appear to me to have at least a touch of light reflecting properties but not enough to give me flashback in photos etc and it's much much finer milled than a regular old translucent powder so much so that I open mine gently otherwise I end up with a dust cloud because it's super fine!
AustralianMakeup,2w6i3b,girl-brush,4,Tue Feb 17 11:47:47 2015 UTC,"I agree! This powder is amazing at oil control. If you want to make it last even longer, powder before foundation (and after primer). You can even powder a little bit on the T-zone after your foundation is done to make it even long-lasting :)"
AustralianMakeup,2w6i3b,colderwater,2,Tue Feb 17 13:05:28 2015 UTC,"My sister JUST got me this as a present. I've had bad experiences with Australis years ago and kinda dismissed them. But this stuff is beautiful. So light and so so fresh! I did notice that without a kabuki brush application it looks a bit cakey, though."
AustralianMakeup,2w6i3b,gospursgo_,1 point,Tue Feb 17 20:02:47 2015 UTC,"How lovely is it!? It's so fine and smooth. Very different to the thick, creamyness of of their pressed powder."
AustralianMakeup,2w6i3b,colderwater,1 point,Tue Feb 17 11:52:56 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I think his is the one I bought when they were out of fresh and flawless and it was TERRIBLE. The girl told me it was just like fresh and flawless :("
AustralianMakeup,2w6i3b,-tactical-turtleneck,1 point,Tue Feb 17 12:42:35 2015 UTC,"I only use it for big nights out, to be honest. It's a heavier coverage and seems to be longer lasting in those kind of situations, but gets reaaally into my pores. Fresh and Flawless has a MUCH nicer finish."
AustralianMakeup,2w6i3b,colderwater,1 point,Tue Feb 17 13:40:24 2015 UTC,I really love this powder too! I've gone through three already. Although I think I preferred the old packaging. Does the new one have a mirror still?
AustralianMakeup,2w6i3b,alyss0r,2,Tue Feb 17 12:37:36 2015 UTC,Yes! There is a little compartment under the powder with a mirror and sponge.
AustralianMakeup,2w6i3b,crossesafimelb,2,Tue Feb 17 12:48:23 2015 UTC,"Pretty annoying to use for touch ups when you're out and about, though... you have to flip between the powder and the mirror."
AustralianMakeup,2w6cyb,Jessijames,6,Tue Feb 17 08:57:01 2015 UTC,"OK ok here is my first application this morning, went on quite well and was easy to build up without being cakey. Did take a bit to dry down and was still a little tacky which I don't love but powder fixes all! So far ~4 hours later it is still fully matte with zero since through so far!  http://imgur.com/a/Vd32H"
AustralianMakeup,2w6cyb,BBQsauceBel,1 point,Wed Feb 18 00:10:04 2015 UTC,Looks lovely on! Seems like a great shade match on you too.
AustralianMakeup,2w6cyb,sarkata,1 point,Wed Feb 18 04:30:33 2015 UTC,Thank you! I thought it would be too dark at first and it has oxidised a fraction but it definitely doesn't even really looks out of place!
AustralianMakeup,2w6cyb,sarkata,6,Wed Feb 18 04:40:24 2015 UTC,"If anyone wants a mini review once I've worn it let me know, this was great timing as I have been super close to grabbing it off Amazon for 2 weeks now!"
AustralianMakeup,2w6cyb,Haibarai,2,Tue Feb 17 08:58:01 2015 UTC,Yes yes yes! I have heard good things about this foundation and am hesitant to try it after having a not great experience with my last covergirl foundation
AustralianMakeup,2w6cyb,sarkata,2,Tue Feb 17 10:43:18 2015 UTC,"Definitely! I'm excited to try it out tomorrow, here is a quick swatch in my average bedroom's lighting - It may be a fraction too dark for my complexion but I think it will work! It has IMO the typical CG smell, not really much smell at all and slightly plastic-y but totally nothing awful!"
AustralianMakeup,2w6cyb,Haibarai,2,Tue Feb 17 10:49:56 2015 UTC,I have samples of the new clinique foundation (they're giving out deluxe samples of the primer and the foundation that they match you to at Myer at the moment if you mention the email) and a Tarte foundation at the moment but I can't resist trying something new
AustralianMakeup,2w6cyb,sarkata,1 point,Tue Feb 17 10:52:44 2015 UTC,Wait omg what email is this?
AustralianMakeup,2w6cyb,sarkata,1 point,Tue Feb 17 12:15:27 2015 UTC,"The most recent myer one email! Always skim them before you delete them if you're signed up because they occasionally have some freebie advertised but not mentioned in the subject of the email. One per customer and they'll give you a little container of the primer and one of their new foundation, and they'll colour match you."
AustralianMakeup,2w6cyb,damn-croissants,1 point,Tue Feb 17 12:22:49 2015 UTC,Do you have to show them the email or just mention it? (I'm not subscribed to their email nor do I have a myer card)
AustralianMakeup,2w6cyb,gospursgo_,1 point,Tue Feb 17 13:33:06 2015 UTC,I suspect you can just ask

AustralianMakeup,2w68uu,manderrrr,2,Wed Mar 11 04:04:52 2015 UTC,"No worries! :) I got the jojoba base, but I think it might be a little too moisture creating for this muggy Sydney weather we're having.

AustralianMakeup,2w1tmb,BlueRainstorm,12,Mon Feb 16 05:52:46 2015 UTC,I've never seen anyone around the She stand at my local Priceline and personally have never bought anything from the brand. I wonder what's going to go in there when they stop stocking them?
AustralianMakeup,2w1tmb,reddit-g,13,Mon Feb 16 05:55:40 2015 UTC,I would LOVE to see Chi Chi go in there or for Red Earth to return but I very much doubt it! If anything Red Earth would be best suited to Target or Myer/DJs & I hope they make that kind of move soon! I am dying to try out their products since the revamp.
AustralianMakeup,2w1tmb,Jessijames,4,Mon Feb 16 07:27:45 2015 UTC,"Sephora seem to be selling Red Earth. I haven't been in their store yet but their website claims they do. I've been waiting for Red Earth to return for a very long time, or at least send out samples."
AustralianMakeup,2w1tmb,One_of_a_Kind,6,Mon Feb 16 07:40:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know Sephora does but that's not all that much help to everyone else not from Sydney haha They have a flagship store right in the city in melbourne but I live in the very outer suburbs and it's difficult for me to get into the city so having it more easily accessible would be fantastic. I'd happily buy online, but with barely 4-5 shades to choose from in their foundation ranges it doesn't give me much hope!"
AustralianMakeup,2w1tmb,Jessijames,2,Mon Feb 16 07:46:34 2015 UTC,"I go to the city nearly everyday. Practically live there. If you're desperate, I could grab it for you?:)"

AustralianMakeup,2w1tmb,One_of_a_Kind,6,Mon Feb 16 12:19:44 2015 UTC,I'm so old that I remember Red Earth having stand alone stores.....
AustralianMakeup,2w1tmb,Stinkysnarly,2,Mon Feb 16 10:36:18 2015 UTC,Same. Though I was much shorter back then...
AustralianMakeup,2w1tmb,One_of_a_Kind,2,Mon Feb 16 12:02:13 2015 UTC,Is it the same brand though? I remember Red Earth was pretty cheap and it's not cheap at Sephora?
AustralianMakeup,2w1tmb,petiteaustralienne,4,Mon Feb 16 09:40:33 2015 UTC,"I remember it being at the higher price range of Priceline when it was stocked there, it was never as cheap as Maybelline etc and if I bought their stuff it was a splurge in my younger eyes like L'Oreal was. If their products are as good as I remember I am happy with their current pricing and from memory it's in the same price range as it used to be!"
AustralianMakeup,2w1tmb,Jessijames,1 point,Mon Feb 16 10:29:07 2015 UTC,I have a Red Earth kabuki brush that was retailing at about $40 so there were definitely on the upper price end of Priceline.
AustralianMakeup,2w1tmb,ComingUpMilhouse,2,Tue Feb 17 09:53:05 2015 UTC,"I think so. Red Earth claim to be the same company since 1991, and Sephora's info is the same. I haven't seen what Sephora sell Red Earth things for.  Edit: I have no memory of what the old prices were like, I was too young to remember."
AustralianMakeup,2w1tmb,One_of_a_Kind,2,Mon Feb 16 12:15:55 2015 UTC,http://www.redearth.com/  I presume Sephora has the same RRP at RE's own online store.
AustralianMakeup,2w1tmb,Jessijames,2,Mon Feb 16 20:32:51 2015 UTC,"Oh ok, thanks! I don't remember prices but I DO remember my 9 year old self thinking it was high end because it was sold at Esprit!"
AustralianMakeup,2w1tmb,petiteaustralienne,3,Tue Feb 17 00:05:06 2015 UTC,"Yaaaasss, Chi Chi! Seriously, I love going to Target and getting Chi Chi but if they were in Priceline as well, they'd get so much more of my money."
AustralianMakeup,2w1tmb,Jessijames,1 point,Mon Feb 16 08:14:08 2015 UTC,"I agree, plus they'd probably be on sale more often via Priceline too!"
AustralianMakeup,2w1tmb,reddit-g,2,Mon Feb 16 10:23:29 2015 UTC,And maybe if Chi Chi was in Priceline it'd be stocked more frequently than in Target (or maybe that's just my Target that's the problem)
AustralianMakeup,2w1tmb,Jessijames,1 point,Mon Feb 16 08:13:21 2015 UTC,"No, all 3 Targets easily accessible to me have low to zero stock and the stands are disgusting! haha"
AustralianMakeup,2w1tmb,reddit-g,1 point,Mon Feb 16 10:23:11 2015 UTC,"I remember waiting months for them to get in the fabulous and flawless foundation, I ended up giving up and going to Myer (there isn't a Myer in my local Westfield unfortunately). There's always stuff everyone and broken shadows and bronzer residue all over the stand. It's like no one cleans it. Unfortunately, it reflects pretty poorly on the brand I think."
AustralianMakeup,2w1tmb,MsOrangeCake,2,Mon Feb 16 11:17:43 2015 UTC,I've seen the odd couple of people around there. I never thought much of the brand until a Priceline lady highly recommended their primer when I was looking for a new one a few months ago. It's my HG and I don't wanna change from it hahah. I'll be sad to see the brand go solely because of that.
AustralianMakeup,2w1tmb,Jessijames,1 point,Mon Feb 16 06:03:42 2015 UTC,"I reckon the newer brand to Priceline, Luma, will go in there as it doesn't have a spot on the walls yet."
AustralianMakeup,2w1tmb,Jessijames,4,Mon Feb 16 13:40:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my HG primer is their magic whatever whatever in the black tube. It's never on sale and rarely in stock anyway. I'm pretty sure that will make it exclusively available through SHE's website and surely the bulk of their business would come from people purchasing them via Priceline? I know I sure as shit won't be paying $10 shipping just to buy it whenever I want it.  I have long thought if they focused on improving/growing their cosmetics side of things and cut down on the 'aromatherapy' type products they could produce some really great stuff but I suppose not now eh!"
AustralianMakeup,2w1tmb,cuntrobber,2,Mon Feb 16 07:23:45 2015 UTC,Which Priceline do you go to? They ALWAYS have a massive cardboard boxy/shelf thing full of them at mine.
AustralianMakeup,2w1tmb,cuntrobber,1 point,Mon Feb 16 07:37:01 2015 UTC,I usually grab it from either Endeavour Hills or Cranbourne Plaza. (VIC)
AustralianMakeup,2w1tmb,szarkasm,2,Mon Feb 16 07:47:20 2015 UTC,If you're after a mattifying primer - i use Rimmel Stay Matte and i love it so much that i am willing to sell my siblings for a lifetime supply should they ever discontinue. :)
AustralianMakeup,2w1tmb,BBQsauceBel,1 point,Mon Feb 16 07:47:00 2015 UTC,"I'll try it out sometime maybe. How long does it last? I use makeup almost everyday, since I have to for work."

AustralianMakeup,2w1tmb,cuntrobber,1 point,Tue Feb 17 17:16:27 2015 UTC,"I find the tube itself isnt very big  and was feeling almost half empty within 2 months or so which is a lot quicker compared to other primers I've trid (L'oreal Base Magique or something, Revlon Photoready). That being said it does say 30mL of product, so it might keep going! And it's also cheaper than the L'oreal and Revlon by a considerable amount.  Highly recommend the primer as a product itself though. Not really a fan of that siliconey texture like L'oreal. The Rimmel one feels more like a cream and sinks into the skin more. Give it a go, esp when you can get it 50% at a sale"
AustralianMakeup,2w1tmb,Syrens,1 point,Mon Feb 16 09:16:54 2015 UTC,"I used rimmel stay matte for SO long. Still use it on no-makeup days to mattify a little. But have since moved on to Perfect Blur for priming. I find it a lot better and you don't use as much/it lasts longer. (But to each their own, we all have different skin). Plus it's super convenient that Coles and Priceline are constantly having 30-50% off sales on Garnier skin care. I never have to pay full price! :)"
AustralianMakeup,2w1tmb,MsOrangeCake,1 point,Mon Feb 16 13:56:46 2015 UTC,I use this too. Holds up to humid QLD summers very well.

AustralianMakeup,2vyijc,sunlandi,6,Sun Feb 15 12:41:23 2015 UTC,"To be honest, all factors considered, that's quite a good price considering it's $85 on beauty bay (also means we don't have to wait over a month for it to arrive). Wonder if that means we can expect a similar price for the naked palettes…?"
AustralianMakeup,2vyijc,reddit-g,7,Mon Feb 16 04:19:18 2015 UTC,Interesting! it's 54USD which is almost exactly $70 with the current exchange rate.
AustralianMakeup,2vyijc,damn-croissants,11,Sun Feb 15 09:23:48 2015 UTC,whoops wrong price - I was thinking of the naked palette. it's 49 usd which is just over $63 here. still works out pretty well when you consider taxes and such
AustralianMakeup,2vyijc,damn-croissants,4,Sun Feb 15 09:25:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Paypal using really shitty rates annoys me the most."
AustralianMakeup,2vyijc,Jessijames,2,Sun Feb 15 22:41:31 2015 UTC,Exactly. That's how I cam unstuck with the big MAC order I did in Dec for a bunch of girls on here myself included. I calculated what everyone owed based on current exchange rates but because I could only pay with PayPal (MAC wouldn't accept my CC) the rate was even worse and I ended up almost $100 out of pocket for an $800 purchase when only about $130 of it was for myself ;(
AustralianMakeup,2vyijc,Jessijames,2,Mon Feb 16 04:21:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that $100 was in addition to the usual exchange rate's pricing. Needless to say, if there's a next time I will most definitely be rounding up when giving everybody a price or just asking for a little more in 'shipping'/extra to cover any discrepancies."
AustralianMakeup,2vyijc,Jessijames,1 point,Mon Feb 16 05:06:17 2015 UTC,"^ Yeah, that's what I meant - just round up the individual shipping by 5% or something just to make sure everything goes smoothly and if there was a significant excess I'd happily refund it back. You live & you learn I guess!"
AustralianMakeup,2vyijc,Jessijames,1 point,Mon Feb 16 07:15:59 2015 UTC,"I definitely am, I am already eyeing off what I want to grab from MAC next but am desperately/semi-patiently waiting for Melt Cosmetics to restock first -.- Another MAC buy won't be for a good couple of months I think, so if you're interested G just keep a list in the back of your head and some moolah aside! ;)"

AustralianMakeup,2vyijc,lemonlemonboom,0,Mon Feb 16 10:29:58 2015 UTC,Considering it's $49 US it could be better but I spose consider tax + shipping + exchange rate it's probably about right :(
AustralianMakeup,2vyijc,Saffrin,6,Mon Feb 16 10:31:44 2015 UTC,"Is that counting US taxes? They don't tend to include it in the listing price, as it's not a federal number like ours.   Edit: It doesn't. Once you add in up to 10% tax, it's pretty much even."

AustralianMakeup,2vygy4,MyOtherRideIsEpona,5,Sun Feb 15 09:24:03 2015 UTC,"Ok, I wore it to work today. It's fairly creamy, but did pull a little under the eyes. I used the yellow colour as a corrector first, then the light colour. I then put YSL Touche Eclat over the top. Set it all with a tiny bit of pressed powder.  It's settled into the fine lines under my eyes a little, but not badly. I also used a mix of the darkest colour and the light colour on a spot on my chin, and it's held up pretty well."

AustralianMakeup,2vygy4,WarlockPanda,4,Sun Feb 15 12:06:11 2015 UTC,"Ok, so I put it on this morning to wear to work. Here are some initial thoughts:   First thing I've noticed is that it is VERY shiny.  I ended up putting on two 'coats' because it's quite sheer, and I prefer a little more coverage.  I applied it with my fingers and I had trouble blending it out. I just noticed it's all settled under my eyebrow hairs I set it with powder to kill the intense shine, but I don't think it's going to last the day. My skin seems to be drinking it, which is probably not the products fault.   I'll give it a few more hours and update you."

AustralianMakeup,2vygy4,szarkasm,4,Mon Feb 16 00:35:46 2015 UTC,"Ok, final review for today. It lasted longer than I expected, but again, coverage wasn't great and it had a bit too much sheen for my liking (which is surprising, normally I'm trying to up the sheen in my base).   Cleansed thoroughly with OCM and I think this is still lurking in the background.   I'll try again tomorrow."

It's near the Kmart end and they sell all Japanese makeup and some hijacked urban decay ($108 for a naked palette!!!) but they have nice lashes there. Also gloss in carousel is good too. I get $4 lashes from there. They seem decent quality. I also look in the bargain bins at Priceline and target.

AustralianMakeup,2vr8ky,PoleL0ver,6,Fri Feb 13 11:18:59 2015 UTC,"Personally, I end up depotting mine - I find that no triage will get it back to its original strength.  You can try melting the area of damage to try and re-set it.   There's a few tutorials online with good step by step instructions for this :)"
AustralianMakeup,2vr8ky,Flippantry,1 point,Fri Feb 13 11:24:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I'm not sure if I'm skilled enough for that though haha it's sorta snapped near the base, any advice for depotting? I haven't done it before so I just have no idea haha"
AustralianMakeup,2vr8ky,Flippantry,5,Fri Feb 13 11:42:48 2015 UTC,"A lipstick is one of the easiest things to depot so you're in luck.  What you can do is just get a nice little sealed container (usually Daiso is a good place to get little cosmetic jars for cheap), pop your broken lipstick in there and scrape out any.  Depending on the jar, you can gentle warm the bottom of it over a match/candle just to melt the lipstick a bit (personally I light a match and just hold it somewhat close to the lipstick very briefly).  This is just to melt it down and make the shape mold the jar a little better.  You need very little heat for this, even a hot summer day in Australia will get the desired results.  It's the most beautiful result but I've got a few damaged lipsticks in jars and I usually just use a lip brush or even scoop a bit out with a Q-Tip and brush it along my lips with my finger (like a lip balm) depending on the finish.   If you need some pictures or better detail, there should be good reviews for depotting lipsticks online too.  I've tried to mend broken lipsticks before and honestly, I've just found they never quite hold up anymore, no matter how gentle I am.  The structural integrity is gone so I find it's better to adapt to a different format really!"
AustralianMakeup,2vr8ky,PepperAndSalt,7,Fri Feb 13 12:12:30 2015 UTC,"If your local Body Shop (or any other makeup/skincare place) is feeling nice they might give you a little empty sample jar too, I've found those jars a great size. Or you could ask for a sample of something and get double the fun - free sample and a jar.  (I used to work at the Body Shop and we had heaps lying around)"
AustralianMakeup,2vr8ky,jamballdonut,2,Fri Feb 13 16:26:25 2015 UTC,"The more I found out about places that do samples, the more I wanna shop there.  I had no idea the Body Shop did samples, so thank you! (Totally irrelevant comment, sorry, but oh weeeell!)"

AustralianMakeup,2vr8ky,PepperAndSalt,1 point,Sat Feb 14 10:54:39 2015 UTC,From the Body Shop I always really liked the skincare range - the seaweed moisturisers are like face crack for me. Working there I had to use the makeup every shift and I really liked quite a lot of it if that's your thing. Also the shea butter and hemp moisturiser range is no joke and will work wonders. I'm sure a lot has changed but they're my go-tos.

AustralianMakeup,2vpppp,Jessijames,5,Fri Feb 13 00:51:05 2015 UTC,Ah I had hassles with this at the end of last year when my C1 Rose Ivory ran out. I let the woman at Priceline convince me that the C2 'Rose Vanilla' was the same shade. They didn't have any open for testing and she guaranteed it was the same. Not only was it too dark but it also oxidised on my skin. Yay!
AustralianMakeup,2vpppp,pumpkinspicevodka,2,Fri Feb 13 05:56:56 2015 UTC,Yeah it's definitely oxidised on me when I've swatched it! Where did you get your C1 from?
AustralianMakeup,2vpppp,pumpkinspicevodka,2,Fri Feb 13 06:23:38 2015 UTC,I got it when I was in the UK early last year. No idea why they don't stock the lighter shades here!
AustralianMakeup,2vpppp,BlissAbyss,5,Fri Feb 13 23:25:09 2015 UTC,Feeling your pain right now. I checked it online and it seems that this is another brand that doesn't stock the lightest shades in Australia. Same thing happens with Covergirl and Maybelline. When they release it here it is sans the lightest shade that they make. Beware of the American swatches as well because sometimes they reformulate it for release here as well. It sucks because I too am that shade. Hence why I am sticking to mid to high end at the moment. Bonus points because you can sample.  If anyone knows a way to buy these foundations without paying the shipping from US (or even where you can get them shipped from) that would be a godsend.   Have you tried the BareMinerals BareSkin foundation? They go really light (UK brand) and are $38 at Mecca I think. So pretty much the same price that you are paying for Revlon and just a little bit more expensive than the one you are after. There are a couple of tricks with application if you do buy it though so keep that in mind.
AustralianMakeup,2vpppp,BlissAbyss,3,Fri Feb 13 04:02:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've been aware of most brand's lack of shade range for many years because it's always been an issue for me but some have gotten much better about importing their lighter (& darker) shades in recent years.  I have the US version & I am about 99% sure the formula is different as well as the obvious difference in packaging. It is very runny & has barely light coverage on me - I used it a few times and threw it to the bottom of the drawer because it's useless - hence why I am after the Euro version which is the same as ours I believe! I remember we used to have the same as the US version but it was replaced a good few years ago now by what we have today.   A lot of those foundations you can buy from Amazon with reasonable shipping, but that's only the US Amazon not the UK one.  I have looked at the BM Bareskin but I have already read a slew of really awful reviews from people who have combo to oily skin so I have avoided it like the plague! I might have to get someone from the UK to grab me a bottle of the True Match via MUE."

Also wondering if I should take my brows to a professional - I've never plucked them and I'm concerned that I don't have a lot to work with. I'd like them to be neater but I'm a bit afraid.
AustralianMakeup,2vlv2w,blitzen25,4,Thu Feb 12 02:10:03 2015 UTC,I needed a new treatment so I decided to go with this deal.. its actually pretty neat. You get two different hair colour vouchers so you can choose the colour you want - I assumed from the ad you got what you were given. I tend not to buy/do a whole heap with my hair but im excited to muck around with this lot :D
AustralianMakeup,2vlv2w,Spitefultongue,3,Thu Feb 12 05:55:30 2015 UTC,"Unless I buy half a dozen cans of Batiste then there's no chance of this happening for me. It looks like a bunch of stuff I'm unlikely to use that's not worth me going out of my way to spend $40, but I still have no doubt it will sell out!"
AustralianMakeup,2vlv2w,Jessijames,3,Thu Feb 12 03:01:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah same, I just don't so anything with my hair to warrant buying products for it. I literally wash it and brush it. That's it :p"

AustralianMakeup,2vlv2w,Jessijames,0,Thu Feb 12 05:16:10 2015 UTC,"I can't see a difference after straightening my hair, it's dead straight naturally which alternates between being a blessing and a curse. It's good because I'm not a hair person, I don't know how to do anything hair related except for when I had a mohawk and put that up but my hair is too long for that now, which makes it look relatively okay with no effort but styling it if I ever wanted is the biggest bitch fight. It won't hold any kind of styling without like...half a can of hairspray because it's too fine and straight and thin. Annoying."

AustralianMakeup,2vmo6u,VelociraptorAlex,1 point,Thu Feb 12 06:52:20 2015 UTC,"Quick review: Forbidden Fruit and Ruby delight leave behind a stain even after they wear off. Unfortunately, all of the lipquench lipsticks have the old school lipstick smell (play doh? It's weird), but wear comfortably. The glossy balms also leave behind a stain, have a very slippy formula and aren't shockingly long lasting. They feel more like a tinted lip balm as opposed to something like Revlons Balm Stains. The biggest downside to these is that they break easily, the softness of the formula means that the crayon will shift from the base within a few uses. Nice colours, but definitely more for a day at the beach than a night out."

AustralianMakeup,2vlm9m,Jessijames,2,Thu Feb 12 03:59:30 2015 UTC,It's at all MAC stores because it's the Viva Glam range :) I've swatched both for you - Miley is on the left and is actually a lot of a blue based pink when it's placed next to Impassioned.

AustralianMakeup,2vibyz,Jessijames,1 point,Wed Feb 11 07:55:22 2015 UTC,Is Shang-Hi more purple than pink? In your swatches it looks similar to LC Utopia which I have!
AustralianMakeup,2vibyz,szarkasm,1 point,Wed Feb 11 06:45:48 2015 UTC,"Honestly I can't pin it down. In most light, it's definitely more pink. But it is more purple than LC's pink velvet (which I've tried one before). It's actually the same colour as the nails I'm wearing today and that nail polish is called pink hahahaha  I just looked at swatches of Utopia and it's VERY close.. I think once again, it's probably close enough to not have both, but just a slight difference in hue."
AustralianMakeup,2vibyz,szarkasm,1 point,Wed Feb 11 06:59:46 2015 UTC,"Ok so I went to my priceline today in Perth and could only find 2 of the new velourlips...  I wanted to see how close these colours are to lime crime's velvetine... and the result is.. they're pretty damn close!  You can see the difference best in the last picture with the flash - the lime crime ones leans a lot more yellow while the Australis ones lean more blue. But in the sunlight there's barely a difference..  Formula wise, Australis comes off as more creamy at first (Lime Crime is a VERY wet formula), but once it dries Australis has a much drier finish. I personally prefer the feel of Lime Crime over Australis (but I prefer Australis over Lime Crime price-wise.. jeez LC's expensive...)  All that said, I did notice in other people's swatches that Buda-Pash is a less blue-based wine colour which might just be an exact dupe to Lime Crime's Wicked! If I ever see it in my store, I'll do another swatch!  and as a side note... as EVERYONE has mentioned.. I wish Shang-Hi wasn't so light.. I was expecting it to be a darker fuschia :(((((("

AustralianMakeup,2vhk3t,tanishatanisha,5,Wed Feb 11 01:48:52 2015 UTC,We have Sephora in Sydney but it's highly marked up on most items. Here is a list of some prices (http://www.reddit.com/r/AustralianMakeup/comments/2ofq4s/collection_of_sephora_sydney_prices/). I would say MAC (not sure how the prices are over there but its $28usd a lipstick here) and maybe some Urban Decay? We don't get the brand till the end of March and it'll probably be out of stock for ages. (and overpriced)  Lorac would also be a good option if you have access.  UK High street is also not avaliable here so that's also another option if you want.
AustralianMakeup,2vhk3t,breviloquent-,2,Wed Feb 11 03:26:18 2015 UTC,"Urban Decay and MAC are great ideas! I think MAC lipsticks are something like $19 here...speaking of UK high street, how hard is it to find Bourjois?"

AustralianMakeup,2veqrr,smilingsunbeams,4,Tue Feb 10 11:53:35 2015 UTC,"I was lucky enough to pick up all five of the new  Velourlips colours today, whoo hoo! So the first thing I did of course was rush home and swatch them. For science.  I did a proper review type thing on my blog here, but TL;DR version is Shang-Hi! ends up looking much brighter when swatched (I was a little disappointed but I do really like the colour it comes out as) and Doo-Bai and Buda-Pash are really similar. Like I probably wouldn’t have bought both if I knew how similar they were.  Fair warning – my camera was playing havoc with the colours today so the arm swatches are more colour accurate than the lip ones.   Also I commented in /u/miss_marshwiggle’s original post but for extra visibility- at my store they only had Shang-Hi! and Doo-Bai out on the floor but had stock of all five colours. The girl who I spoke to told me they just got them into today (this was a store in Melb city) so they should hit your store soon if they’re not already there. And I would definitely ask for the others if you only see the two out.  And just as a reminder -  if you wanna pick them up for $7 each (super reasonable IMO) make sure you get them before the 30% off Priceline sale ends because it’s finishing tomorrow!!  PS - paging /u/sarkata. I know you do awesome swatches so I hope mine don't disappoint! :)"

AustralianMakeup,2veqrr,redtonks,1 point,Tue Feb 10 14:49:40 2015 UTC,"Yep, they're a matte product. Once they dry down they last fairly well on me. I do get flaking after eating though. I did a more comprehensive review on my blog (linked below I think) including a smudge test) but there's also heaps of other reviews out there if you google them :)"
AustralianMakeup,2veqrr,sarkata,2,Tue Feb 10 14:54:55 2015 UTC,"Awesome thank you! Should've done my own research, I was just gobsmacked that I've never seen the before & got a bit excited!"
AustralianMakeup,2veqrr,sarkata,2,Tue Feb 10 15:05:10 2015 UTC,Aaaah. Lucky yours had all five. I stood and went through the Priceline stock drawers with the staff and mine definitely only got two in :(   I am pretty disappointed there isn't much of a different between Doo-Bai and Buda-Pash. But I'll probably buy the remaining three once I find them!
AustralianMakeup,2veqrr,Luminitha,3,Tue Feb 10 21:40:03 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry! I really hate it when stores are inconsistent with their stock especially if the sale is ending today :( did you try calling some other stores in the city?   In the tube it seems like Buda-Pash will be slightly darker and browner but it really didn't translate. I do kinda wish Australis had given us a deep red and a deep purple, but hey that's what sisters are for right? To offload your unused lip colours?"
AustralianMakeup,2veqrr,amyeh,2,Tue Feb 10 23:45:34 2015 UTC,I'm going to Priceline today and you have given me hope they will have at least some of the new colours!
AustralianMakeup,2veqrr,rainbowplethora,2,Tue Feb 10 23:01:45 2015 UTC,I'm crossing my fingers for you! :)
AustralianMakeup,2vgia6,damn-croissants,2,Tue Feb 10 21:03:00 2015 UTC,Mecca does samples! I've been numerous times for various NARS foundations (I'm using one right now). I usually just ask for a foundation match and a sample afterwards (i mention that i have eczema or what not and say i just want to make sure that i dont break out)
AustralianMakeup,2vgia6,breviloquent-,2,Tue Feb 10 21:09:36 2015 UTC,I just want to add how adorable I think the NARS foundation samples are! I've gotten a couple of them with orders and they're so cute in their little bottle although I do find they can be a bit annoying to get the stuff out.
AustralianMakeup,2vgia6,catrixo,1 point,Wed Feb 11 03:06:54 2015 UTC,"awesome, thank you. i've never asked because i never wanted to be told no! may i ask which one you use?"
AustralianMakeup,2vgia6,breviloquent-,2,Tue Feb 10 22:50:53 2015 UTC,The cream compact :)
AustralianMakeup,2vgia6,gospursgo_,2,Wed Feb 11 00:50:39 2015 UTC,Hey! I just picked up a sample of sheer glow and a sample of the tinted moisturiser. The girls are usually super lovely. Don't be shy!  Your shade might be around Barcelona or the next darker one?
AustralianMakeup,2vgia6,breviloquent-,2,Tue Feb 10 23:04:54 2015 UTC,I'm Barcelona and I'm a 56 in Bourjois! She's definitely lighter

AustralianMakeup,2vgia6,pondicus,2,Tue Feb 10 23:11:27 2015 UTC,Honestly? Didn't like either. I have TRUE combination skin- it clung to my dry patches and didn't hold up on my oily zone. Only gave it another shot cause it's so yellow and perfect colour match. Much happier with the new maybelline one that's just come out!
AustralianMakeup,2vch7z,Jessijames,3,Mon Feb 9 21:56:22 2015 UTC,I really want to try this. What is your skin type like?  Does anyone know if you can get it other r than from Woolies? I'd need to swatch it for colour matching.
AustralianMakeup,2vch7z,Ienjoylongwalks,8,Mon Feb 9 22:16:57 2015 UTC,"I am oily as a MOFO for reference, and this holds up fairly well as long as I prime and set (which I usually do anyway).  I got mine from Priceline (Fountain gate here in Vic although most shades had been cleaned out!) - I had seen it a couple of weeks ago in my local Woolies, but they only had 020 Classic Ivory as the lightest shade and I was worried that Maybelline AU hadn't bothered to import the lightest shade they sell in the US like they tend to do but when I spotted the display in Priceline they indeed had 010 Porcelain Ivory - Last bottle too! I am an NW10/NARS Siberia or so for reference, this pulls quite pink and could be a bit lighter for me but it is definitely still wearable and doesn't look too out of place. It's finish so far more than makes up for it!  I didn't bother to swatch it, I knew the shade would be fairly fine for me as one of my favourite vloggers is very pale and similar shade-wise to me and she had no issues with this shade and gave it a huge thumbs up (she also has oily skin)."
AustralianMakeup,2vch7z,mackinnon_13,3,Mon Feb 9 22:37:20 2015 UTC,I'm so happy to hear that it a) lasts on your oily skin and b) is pale enough. HALLELUJAH!
AustralianMakeup,2vch7z,mackinnon_13,2,Tue Feb 10 00:16:12 2015 UTC,Me too! At first swatch it looks like it would be too dark but once buffed in it blends down very well and isn't as dark. DECEPTION! haha
AustralianMakeup,2vch7z,Ienjoylongwalks,1 point,Tue Feb 10 00:19:03 2015 UTC,I swatched it a couple of days ago and the lightest looked like pretty good for a winter match for me. How much is it? I couldn't see a price tag and wasn't really there to be buying things so I took it as a sign to step away.
AustralianMakeup,2vch7z,Ienjoylongwalks,2,Tue Feb 10 00:37:17 2015 UTC,It's $21.95 :/ But I needed a new powder as well and Priceline has 3 for 2 on at the moment so I got some of their new chubby lip pencil things as well - that are also the bomb.com !! Fingers crossed Chemist Warehouse gets the new ranges ins tock before their next 40% off sale!  I might even do a couple of comparison swatches when I get home.
AustralianMakeup,2vch7z,AgentLauren,1 point,Tue Feb 10 00:40:43 2015 UTC,"I was in Chem Warehouse at chaddy before and had a quick look, they had a space for that foundation but it was empty, didnt look for the other new things though."

AustralianMakeup,2vch7z,backwards01,2,Tue Feb 10 00:02:59 2015 UTC,"Ever since I was a teen, Maybellne was always one of my avoid like the plague brands because everything I had ever tried was so awful both texture and colour wise, but I think in the last 2 years or so they have really started to pick up their game!   I read quite a few really great reviews on this and since I am dying to get my hands on the YSL Fusion Ink foundation which is similar in nature I thought this might at least give me a road test to see if I like the serum to powder style formula.   More impressed that I expected to be and it holds up/stays matte quite well for me compared to a loooooooooooot of other foundations! Currently at 4 hours of wear on a slightly muggy soon to be hot Melbourne day and it still feels matte and my powder has held up like I just applied it! Usually by this time the oil has started to work through my finishing powder and I reapply/touch up around lunchtime but I don't even know if I will need to. I will check back in mid-afternoon and see how it has held up without a touch up!"
AustralianMakeup,2vch7z,backwards01,1 point,Tue Feb 10 00:09:10 2015 UTC,"The Maybelline range has never particularly impressed me until recently. I only ever used their Dream Matte powder, which worked a charm on my super oily skin. I wasn't interested in anything else they had until the colour tattoos and pen liner came along.  A few months ago I tried the FitMe sticks and they broke me out something shocking, so I'm always hesitant about Maybelline foundations now.  I saw you say that it pulls a bit pink, which is pretty useless for me since my neck is yellow as all hell. But I hope it holds up well for you!"
AustralianMakeup,2vch7z,blackgirldownunder,2,Tue Feb 10 00:18:26 2015 UTC,"It definitely pulls a little pink, my neck is fairly neutral to yellow but I have lightly bended it down with the remnants of the products on my brush and it blends it quite well!   I also hated the fit me stick, it pulled way way pinker on me than this fluid-touch does though and looked cakey to boot! I am trying to use it up for the sake of it but it's hard -.-"

I also tried the maybelline dream matte mousse and one shade is too pink and the deepest shade is too dark.  Apart from those,  pretty much every foundation l have I did the online gamble."

AustralianMakeup,2vd0fv,MenstrualFlow,5,Tue Feb 10 00:20:18 2015 UTC,"I've only done makeup a few times as an amateur but the items I found to be very useful and often considered less (since they're more tools rather than makeup themselves) that I thought mentioning would be:   Bulk spoolies and doe-foot applicators - definitely pick these up from somewhere like eBay or Aliexpress because I almost choked on my drink when I saw Priceline charging something like $8 for 25 (you can get 200 or sth for about $3!)  Wet wipes & Paper Towels Q-tips Tweezers - I find these pretty handy in a few ways, good for assisting with false lashes or even separating real lashes if you've got a fussy clump   Also   Clear lip liner - ELF has one for just a few dollars, good for outlining brow shapes too, just clean up with a Q-tip afterwards."

AustralianMakeup,2vd0fv,Jessijames,2,Tue Feb 10 00:57:03 2015 UTC,"Currently I have a variety of products including two primers, a few blush shades, multiple lipsticks, three palettes, loads of brushes, a contour kit, etc.  The only things that I don't have are foundations. Would it be best to purchase the lightest shade, middle shade, and darkest shade so that I can mix them?"
AustralianMakeup,2vd0fv,blackgirldownunder,1 point,Tue Feb 10 00:28:48 2015 UTC,"IMO I think it would really depend on how big the shade range is for the foundation you are looking at using in your kit. If it was like MAC for example and had dozens of shades, each one still at least similar to the next then I would say skip 1-2 in between and mix but if it were say a drugstore foundation with a more limited shade range and each shade is much more of a bigger jump in shade than the one before, then pick them all up."
AustralianMakeup,2vd0fv,SEXPILUS,1 point,Tue Feb 10 01:19:50 2015 UTC,You'd also need to get enough different foundations to match undertones.  It might be worth looking at camera ready cosmetics and face atelier because they have lots of colours to change undertones.
AustralianMakeup,2vd0fv,SEXPILUS,1 point,Tue Feb 10 02:47:30 2015 UTC,"As the other users mentioned, you'll definitely need more foundations to match both shade and undertone. But have you also considered different finishes? There are a lot of options and each suits different circumstances."
AustralianMakeup,2vd0fv,jamballdonut,1 point,Tue Feb 10 04:54:57 2015 UTC,I was actually thinking that I could purchase matte-semi matte foundations and mix in a liquid illuminator if they want a dewy finish. Would that work? I haven't tried it before.
AustralianMakeup,2vd0fv,pondicus,1 point,Tue Feb 10 05:54:47 2015 UTC,"With the right illuminator, it could work quite well. I do it often using MAC strobe cream."
AustralianMakeup,2vd0fv,SEXPILUS,1 point,Tue Feb 10 05:56:45 2015 UTC,"I'd 100% recommend the RCMA foundation palette (Which you can get from Camera Ready Cosmetics, pretty sure).  It's what's in my kit & is great.  You don't want to take too many liquids, because they get heavy quuuuuuickly, and then there's the problem of not having the right shades, etc etc. It's also thin/smallish so it easily fits in, over multiple bottles, which also have the risk of breaking and going eveeeerywhere and causing lots of mess.  The RCMA foundation palette + a colour wheel (Like the Kryolan one, which has white, black, blue, yellow, and green, I thiiiink) means you have every shade and every undertone covered & it's only 2 small palettes.  Cream is also easier to work with, since you need less, and you can easily make it dewy by adding in a liquid highlighter (Like the Face of Australia one or the Inglot one).  This is what I do and it works brilliantly.  Nobody is just 1 shade, so you're always going to have to mix anyway & if most of it is cream w/ a little bit of liquid, it's going to work easier.  Let me know if you have any questions, I'll write a more detailed list once I'm home with my kit list near me :)"
AustralianMakeup,2vd0fv,pondicus,-1,Tue Feb 10 06:31:53 2015 UTC,"I would honestly get matched at MAC or Mecca first to get your colour code, then try your luck with [Findation](www.findation.com) to figure out other brands that may or may not match you. Findation isn't a 100% match, so if you can - definitely ask for a sample to last a few days. Foundation always looks different in store lighting compared to natural light and direct sun.   As for foundation brands, it really depends on your preference. MAC do dewy really well, whereas NARS have a nice ""inner glow"" look. MAC has better coverage, but I prefer NARS formula on my skin. Also application depends from person to person - some people use their fingers, others swear by brushes, while some prefer Beauty Blender.   Good luck all your search! :)  Edit - and there is nothing wrong with drugstore products. Some of their formulas are even better than well-known brands like Chanel or Stila. I've personally had great success with Maybelline and Rimmel in the past. My yellow-undertones just mean NARS is one of very few brands that actually match my skintone. Again, each to their own!"
AustralianMakeup,2vaa8m,score1fortheprincess,7,Mon Feb 9 09:27:54 2015 UTC,"I absolutely use all of the highlights. Banana for undereye, pink toned for everywhere else, and shimmer to layer on top of the bits you really want to bring forward.  As for the contours, I use the coolest colour for all of the deeper shadows I want to make (cheekbones and nose, usually), and then use the middle colour for softer contouring (most the perimeter of my face). The warmest colour I've just been using for eyeshadow, so far, but I think it could be used as a bronzer if you could be fucked blending it out enough."

They are super pigmented too so I definitely have to use a light hand with them.  As for the highlight shades, I really like the shimmery one to add some depth to my blush, I use the matte light shade for contouring on my forehead, nose and chin and at the moment I'm still learning about using the yellow powder to try and illuminate dull spots on the skin but it's pretty nifty!  I think the versatility of the palette and the price tag (especially because with the 30% style sales, you can nab it even cheaper) it makes for a pretty desirable item.  It's also pretty unique in Australia considering ABH is not so easily available in it's full catalogue and other than a few flavour items, there's very few contouring options on the cheaper end.  Usually I'm not an Australis fan, for the longest time I just never really got along with their products but I'm pretty impressed with some of their recent releases and I hope to see some more cool stuff from them :D"
AustralianMakeup,2vaa8m,digitalcatbox,1 point,Mon Feb 9 12:34:38 2015 UTC,"I'm glad its a decent product and not all flash bang. I'll still use it, I just wont use 3 of the colours really. Light hand, I must remember that."
AustralianMakeup,2vaa8m,jamballdonut,3,Mon Feb 9 20:45:44 2015 UTC,"I massively prefer using 1 product to contour with, but had heard SOOOO much about the ABH one that I picked up the Australis one practically as soon as it was released.  I can only use 1 contour colour, and it's soooo pigmented and easy to mess up, and I actually don't really like any of the highlight shades very much.  I definitely think it's over-hyped, and companies are just jumping on the latest trend.  (Although, I can sort of see how it would be good to keep in a makeup artists kit, I definitely won't be putting it in mine.  Cream contouring is way easier anyway!)"
AustralianMakeup,2vaa8m,ComingUpMilhouse,3,Mon Feb 9 10:49:15 2015 UTC,May I ask what you use for cream contouring?
AustralianMakeup,2vaa8m,ellie_girl,2,Mon Feb 9 13:59:29 2015 UTC,"Generally just a cream foundation palette, or if I'm just doing it on myself I use the Audacious Asphalt Color Tattoo (Since it's grey toned) and then just some contour powder over the top if it isn't heavy enough (But, it normally is)"
AustralianMakeup,2vaa8m,Jessijames,2,Mon Feb 9 23:12:27 2015 UTC,"The ABH one is customisable though, you can pick the six shades you want. Glad I'm not the only one questioning the hype."
AustralianMakeup,2vaa8m,ellie_girl,2,Mon Feb 9 10:56:48 2015 UTC,"In the defence of Australis, the ABH palette didn't used to be customisable. Personally the product isn't for me, I'm much more fond of the Sleek contour palettes."
AustralianMakeup,2vaa8m,sugarfixkid,3,Mon Feb 9 11:49:29 2015 UTC,"Not bagging australis, they were really smart to jump on the bandwagon so quick! The people wanted contour at an affordable price point and that's what they got."
AustralianMakeup,2vaa8m,Ienjoylongwalks,2,Mon Feb 9 20:42:13 2015 UTC,I wont lie I can't use most of mine I manage to use all the highlight shades and one contour colour. I did buy a backup but I would much have preferred to buy a replacement pan. I do use it a lot though and am used to it being a part of my routine but when it all runs out I will be searching for something else to replace it with.
AustralianMakeup,2vaa8m,amyeh,2,Mon Feb 9 10:10:32 2015 UTC,I think this is where the ABH version wins out now that they have refill pans and you can buy a palette fully customised palette from the get go. Once I use mine up or at the very least hit pan on a couple of the shades I will be thinking about shelling out for the ABH for sure although I'd be more interested if I could buy a 3 or 4 pan palette not have to have a big 6 pan.
AustralianMakeup,2vaa8m,lemilyfresh,1 point,Mon Feb 9 22:03:02 2015 UTC,My phone has kindly just informed me you left a comment...  I am tempted but I have fair to light medium skin with pink base tones I find it so hard to use most powders as it is I really really want to try before I buy. However I completely agree 6 gives you practically two shades you may not actually use. I'd rather double up on two of the same highlight powder because I tend to use more but being able to buy the ABH pans separately you can. I am probably going to wait till my birthday to splurge and put in a direct order.
AustralianMakeup,2vaa8m,missbo,1 point,Tue Feb 10 10:03:17 2015 UTC,"NYX has come out with a contour palette you can customise too, I don't know if/when it would be available in Australia though."

But again, $2 and I will finally know what the colour hype was all about.  If there is any in my priceline bins.

I have used the Maybelline age rewind concealer and I still use it because it's a great drug store concealer. But for the under eye (and highlighting/brightening), I prefer the LA Girl pro concealer just because it doesn't crease (or crease as much as age rewind). The LA Girl concealer has amazing longevity and it's much cheaper.  If you want to minimise creasing on Maybelline age rewind, I use Revlon Colorstay powder, and it doesn't crease on me (and other powders have creased)."
AustralianMakeup,2v6d53,yolington,1 point,Mon Feb 9 07:00:47 2015 UTC,I use the elf concealer/highlighter thing and love it. The lightest shade is perfect for my ghostly skin.

AustralianMakeup,2v6d53,nixedreamer,1 point,Wed Feb 11 12:06:06 2015 UTC,"maybelline age rewind set immediately with translucent powder (applied with a damp sponge!!) works really well for me, or maybelline fit me in fair (same thing with setting it) works well. fit me conceals dark circles far better than the age rewind, but I always end up layering them anyway (age rewind, blend, fit me, blend, set). I don't tend to crease a lot under the eyes unless I load up on thick concealers so maybe I'm just lucky with it. good luck finding something that works!!  edit: I also don't use either of these like concealer/highlighter combos, I'm just super super pale and could probably go for something paler, but alas...nothing."

AustralianMakeup,2v2xhz,seenoright,3,Sun Feb 8 01:14:19 2015 UTC,"I think they go stiff because of using this shampoo.  I used to use the masters brush cleaner (got it off ebay) for ages without ever losing the softness of my brushes, but then switched over to the baby shampoo for a few times and they were noticeably different.  I know it's more expensive but you really don't need much and it's really an investment in prolonging the life of your brush."

Basically, they're lovely and comfy but with darker colours like these are a touch messy and will not be true to colour in one swipe, contrary to their claims.  I'm currently trying to organise a group order from the states, as shipping is a flat rate of $19USD (I splurged on these in my impatience) and all that's still on my list is Sad Girl, maybe Milkshake if I'm feeling frisky, so if there's any more interest let me know!

I also use it gently on my eye brushes instead of water etc to pick up pigments and or shadows I want to really pack on. I also give a spritz to my face blending/buffing brushes/beauty blender (once already wet) before I use them to put on my foundation, I find it sort of helps it go on a little smoother and also creates a barrier between the bristles and the foundation so it doesn't cake up as much within the brush.  I have also read it is great for prepping dry skin, give yourself a spritz after your moisturiser has sunk in but before you prime and it will help with skin hydration  Basically, for me and those uses a little goes a long way and a bottle lasts me a while. Worth the investment IMO!"
AustralianMakeup,2uxnk0,score1fortheprincess,2,Fri Feb 6 01:03:32 2015 UTC,I've ordered from them. It was good service but their process for international orders is a little bit complex. After you select Australia click Update Cart. It then changes the shipping options so that you can choose Need a Shipping Quote. You then have to submit the order using the Call Me: type a phone # here option for payment. They don't actually call they'll just email you with the different shipping options for what you have ordered and give you a link to make the payment that also includes a box to tell them which shipping method you chose.
AustralianMakeup,2uxnk0,winter_iris,2,Fri Feb 6 05:57:14 2015 UTC,"Ah, ok. Thanks! That is a little ridiculous, surely they could implement a better system"
AustralianMakeup,2uxnk0,winter_iris,2,Fri Feb 6 06:05:52 2015 UTC,Probably. I am however willing to forgive them given how cheap they are and the fact that they packed my order into an amazingly small box so that the shipping cost was as low as possible (sadly something that doesn't seem to be that common when ordering makeup from the US).
AustralianMakeup,2uxnk0,morning_cat_breath,3,Fri Feb 6 06:47:51 2015 UTC,I just want the stuffs.
AustralianMakeup,2uxnk0,winter_iris,2,Fri Feb 6 09:22:43 2015 UTC,"Ah if you don't mind me asking, about how much was shipping for you? I've been meaning to order pressing tools and binder from them but tales of high shipping have spooked me, haha."

AustralianMakeup,2uxewm,badassbettie,2,Fri Feb 6 00:26:47 2015 UTC,I've also been interested in swapping unused makeup and samples but don't have Facebook and not enough comment karma to do swaps through the aussiemakeupexchange.. If your interested in swapping with me feel free to message with me and gave a chat :)
AustralianMakeup,2uuurg,panda_bear88,24,Thu Feb 5 09:27:28 2015 UTC,"What the actual fuck.  Sorry for my lack of tenderness around this but that brand can fuck right off quite frankly.  From what I've seen, it's overpriced, average quality and now they just seem to think it's acceptable to bully people who reach out with reasonable requests?    I'd say boycott them but I want to believe that their price point (and method of distribution) vs how established/renowned they are is enough of a deterrent for most.   I really wish that you didn't have to abandon your account, especially over something like this but I understand that you've gotta do what feels best for you.    MRW companies pull shit like this >:("
AustralianMakeup,2uuurg,Flippantry,16,Thu Feb 5 10:45:40 2015 UTC,"I was never going to buy from them anyway due to their ridiculous pricing, but now I have another reason. Vile and foul."
AustralianMakeup,2uuurg,pootlepower,14,Thu Feb 5 10:42:57 2015 UTC,"Wow. Just.....wow. That is shocking. This company should be totally ashamed for bullying you like that. I saw your original post and you were totally in the right, that advertising is incredibly misleading. I hope a rep from the company sees this. I will discourage my customers from buying their products. For shame."
AustralianMakeup,2uuurg,pootlepower,8,Thu Feb 5 10:44:57 2015 UTC,"To be honest, they were calling to ""fix the situation"" because it was obvious I was an ""unhappy customer"" based on my post. Although you would think after contacting them three times that it would be obvious I was unhappy. But as I said in the OP, it was intimidating. It may not have been intentional. I think it was more that they took the wrong approach to what they were trying to achieve."
AustralianMakeup,2uuurg,Jessijames,24,Thu Feb 5 10:49:26 2015 UTC,"Either way it's total bullshit. You shouldn't have to air their dirty laundry in a public forum to get them to care about customer satisfaction. As a smaller, rather expensive company being sold out of Coles you'd think they'd value every last customer they can get. I really want to encourage you not to abandon your account (or at least not this sub), not only because of the great content you post but because sticking around would be the ultimate bitchy 'you can't scare me, muthafucker' move. But you gotta do what's right for you."
AustralianMakeup,2uuurg,MsOrangeCake,10,Thu Feb 5 10:58:36 2015 UTC,"This is exactly how I feel about this, but on the other hand I do definitely understand and agree with PB's stance on her no longer having the safety net of anonymity."
AustralianMakeup,2uuurg,One_of_a_Kind,10,Thu Feb 5 11:05:46 2015 UTC,"I think if you're trying to be a ""grown up"" company and the customer is dissatisfied then you offer to send out a coupon for something from their cosmetics line for the value of the product. At the least! I have had orders go wrong with skincare products before and the company sent the order to me again... 3x the amount what I had originally ordered!"
AustralianMakeup,2uuurg,jamballdonut,10,Thu Feb 5 11:01:12 2015 UTC,I was offered only 2 courses of action when I called them 1) return the product at my own cost to receive a refund or; 2) pick another liquid lipstick of my choice. I did not want a second lip product since it was obvious that their colour representations could not be trusted. I also felt because I was misled that I shouldn't have to pay to return the item (which was so heavily advertised). They were not willing to negotiate over the issue when I called them.
AustralianMakeup,2uuurg,SEXPILUS,14,Thu Feb 5 11:08:09 2015 UTC,"Wow, I would never expect something so small would blow up like that. I am very sorry that this has happened to you. Protecting anonymity on reddit is also such a high priority for me.  I would consider going to the Department of Fair Trading over the original issue. It seems like a big step, but that government department exists for a reason.  All the best, whatever parts of the internet you go to."
AustralianMakeup,2uuurg,redtonks,10,Thu Feb 5 11:51:34 2015 UTC,"Have you contacted the ACCC about this? I definitely think you should give them a call and see if you have any options about your refund.  I don't think they have the right to hold your money ransom, and as far as I know, when the product isn't as described THEY have to pay postage back + your refund.  I dunno, but I also don't want to see you go and the Google Words thing sounds very plausible, rather than someone ratting you out."
AustralianMakeup,2uuurg,breviloquent-,8,Fri Feb 6 13:58:19 2015 UTC,"When I worked in CS, managers used to wet their pants when customers contacted ACCC. Doing that will get things resolved promptly and correctly. Highly recommended."
AustralianMakeup,2uuurg,xenomorphic_acid,9,Sat Feb 7 10:57:54 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry you were treated like this. I really feel companies should learn to leave well enough alone, and people are entitled to their opinions, but I guess somewhere along the way all that glitter inhalation gives a few of them permanent brain damage.   Hugs. And chocolate. Want some vodka? I've got plenty if you want to escape for a few days."
AustralianMakeup,2uuurg,drunkerxx,10,Thu Feb 5 10:23:40 2015 UTC,I'm actually so sorry that this has happened to you and it's actually completely shit how this has all played out. Thank you for all the post you've done and everything you contributed to the sub. Actually checked if you were a mod of this subreddit (to say thanks) cos you've been so active + great.   sending good internet vibes xx
AustralianMakeup,2uuurg,icicle_,9,Thu Feb 5 10:33:08 2015 UTC,"That's horrible, I can't believe they treated you like that! :( I was considering trying their stuff but there's no way I can support a company that would intimidate customers. It's Lime Crime all over again."
AustralianMakeup,2uuurg,sydneysomething,9,Thu Feb 5 10:56:21 2015 UTC,"Thats terrible, I will definitely never ever order from them and I will be sharing this experience with others."
AustralianMakeup,2uuurg,sydneysomething,8,Thu Feb 5 10:59:16 2015 UTC,"This is disgusting, I can't believe they have literally bullied you into closing your account :(. This company had already caused a stir in this community and you know what? Considering what you've said is true, you're allowed to say it. There is absolutely nothing wrong or illegal about reviewing products for what they are.  This just puts them in an even worse light. I will definitely not be recommending this company to anyone.   Again, I am disgusted by their level of un-professionalism and awful customer service."

AustralianMakeup,2uuurg,MsOrangeCake,9,Thu Feb 5 11:01:57 2015 UTC,Please see my post above about google alerts... It may not have been a person emailing them after all. It would be a social media manager's job to do something like that.
AustralianMakeup,2uuurg,Flippantry,2,Thu Feb 5 11:06:44 2015 UTC,2 weeks after my OP? I'm not sure how those alerts work. But I did try googling my post and couldn't find it.
AustralianMakeup,2uuurg,Jessijames,7,Thu Feb 5 11:09:36 2015 UTC,"I think it might depend on how long it takes for google's search bots to find your post, too, before it can be picked up by an alert. Your post has definitely been trawled by google but the SEO looks quite low. IDK I always give the ""another customer told us about this review"" statement a bit of a side eye because non-indie companies are usually very slickly ran social media machines and are desperate not to look bad."

As someone who is absolutely not employed by Daiso ;) (who is definitely not posting on behalf of her company and therefore doesn't violate her contract) here are some of my recommendations:   Makeup brush cleaner/sponge cleaner - there are two types and they sell out stupidly fast because they are so good. I recommend the brush cleaner in the clear bottle a bit more than the other one, it's thinner and seems to give a more thorough clean Eyelashes - my personal favourite are the ones in the orange packet, they are tapered and look really natural and full Eyebrow coat - in a little nail polish-like bottle, use as the final step in your brow routine to hold everything in place Felt tip eyeliner - a little drying but it's SO black and you can get a great wing with it Charcoal pore care pack - pore strips for your nose that work better than any other I've tried   They also have a bunch of great makeup storage stuff, including some clear acrylic ones that I've just bought to reorganise all my cosmetics."
AustralianMakeup,2uuv4l,Flippantry,2,Fri Feb 6 01:05:04 2015 UTC,"Haha yes! When I took mine off I was like, have I been walking around with dirt rubbed on my face all day or something?   Next time you're in Daiso, just ask someone. New stock comes in a few days a week and I swear every time the brush cleaner gets put in a new spot. Otherwise try Johnson's baby shampoo, it's great for a deep clean."

AustralianMakeup,2uu9i4,miss_marshwiggle,3,Thu Feb 5 08:59:32 2015 UTC,"I haven't tried any of the Velourlips so I can't compare, but I love the Soft Matte Lip Creams!

AustralianMakeup,2uu9i4,Kateus3000,1 point,Thu Feb 5 11:14:51 2015 UTC,"I don't find much of a difference between the two. I think some of the Velourlips lighter colours are less pigmented and don't stay as long as the lighter matte lip creams.

Were there any brands in particular you were after?  Also I totally understand wanting to get it in person. Even if one of my friends buys online they've usually tried it in person first."

AustralianMakeup,2usy8u,pondicus,1 point,Thu Feb 5 21:54:45 2015 UTC,"It's not unscented, but I've had a lot of success with Zoe Foster's Go To Properly Clean cleanser, which is foamy and gentle enough to remove eye makeup no worries. It's not that much cheaper aka $29.95 :( It is only available online and the bottle lasts me about 6 months for 150ml? I have sensitive skin with eczema every now and then - I haven't had any issues with it and I'm on my second bottle.  Ingredients are:   Water, Sodium Cocoamphoacetate, Glycerin, Lauryl Glucoside, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Sodium Lauryl Glucose Carboxylate, Sodium Chloride, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzyl Alcohol, Citric Acid, Willow Bark Extract, Natural Fragrance (ginger, mandarin and lime).

AustralianMakeup,2uqgut,MsOrangeCake,6,Wed Feb 4 07:41:13 2015 UTC,"Yes!  Just make sure you have your receipt still.  I've taken a used foundation and a used moisturiser back before because they had reacted terribly with my skin.  At the time that I took the foundation back, my skin didn't look too bad but they didn't ask questions.  What they should do is give you a little return slip with some details you need to fill in as well as a reason and generally they'll just refund back onto your card or in cash."
AustralianMakeup,2uqgut,Flippantry,2,Wed Feb 4 07:44:47 2015 UTC,"Yay! I was a bit hesitant to just go up there and ask because they're my local Priceline and I go in there to browse all of the time, I didn't want to get death stares from the manager in case returns weren't allowed."
AustralianMakeup,2uqgut,jamballdonut,2,Wed Feb 4 07:52:26 2015 UTC,"If you're in there all the time, then they may recognise you as a loyal customer & know you're not just doing it to be a dick! I don't see why they would hold it against you or anything.  :)"

AustralianMakeup,2uqgut,ComingUpMilhouse,1 point,Wed Feb 4 12:16:13 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, I do the same, but I think they're starting to recognise me.  My local K-Mart too! Even though I only buy like once a fortnight, and it's normally only one or two small items.  Whoops!"
AustralianMakeup,2uqgut,tracesoflace,6,Wed Feb 4 12:18:31 2015 UTC,I even took a shampoo back once because it reacted very badly. Once you've used a product change of mind isn't cool but if the product has reacted wrong and not performed as promised you have every right to request a refund. Bring your receipt and the store sends it back to the manufacturer.
AustralianMakeup,2uqgut,SpagattahNadle,2,Wed Feb 4 08:44:00 2015 UTC,"Sometimes yes, sometimes no. It depends who is on staff!"
AustralianMakeup,2uqgut,queenblackacid,0,Wed Feb 4 09:24:50 2015 UTC,I asked them about their return policy while I was there last and they said they can't take it back unless it's faulty- you have to go to the manufacturer with receipt.
AustralianMakeup,2uqgut,SpagattahNadle,7,Wed Feb 4 10:09:48 2015 UTC,I'm not sure if Australian consumer law has anything to say on this or not... Would causing a reaction mean it hasn't satisfied its primary objective? Then the consumer can return it to the place of purchase with receipt and can choose whether replace or refund.
AustralianMakeup,2uq3xb,crossesafimelb,8,Wed Feb 4 05:10:42 2015 UTC,"I've travelled a few times and I've gotten better at packing my makeup and skincare.  If I'm going for ages I am usually buying makeup over there but if I'm not planning on shopping I pack lightly anyway.  I use Lush skincare and have found items like the face soap can double as a makeup remover and I can cut the soap to a small size to bring along. I love Lushes shower gels they last me long and same with the shampoo bars. I go for Godiva which is a two in one. Items like coconut oil I can decant into travel containers. I usually take lots of photos so I do like wearing makeup overseas. I however do not wear anything going to the airport and I bring a hand cream and moisturiser or Natio facial mist spray to freshen my skin on the flight. I bring heavy duty lip balm as well. I always break out from flights.  My essentials are mascara, eye makeup remover, lots of lip balm, one lip stain or lip stick. Maybe one eyeshadow or just mascara. I like the two in one lip/cheek creams from Essence or Australis. You use your fingers so that's one less brush. I don't skimp on bringing a mattifying powder though and lots of sunscreen as its pricey overseas. I bring one tiny good quality body butter/cream as I get dry skin from flying and one hair product.  I usually stick to eye creams rather eye powder shadows as they go further and are more easy to apply with fingers.  Sorry I went on too much haha. Have a nice trip though. :)"
AustralianMakeup,2uq3xb,puffandruffle,5,Wed Feb 4 05:28:03 2015 UTC,"I too, am going to Europe soon, so here is my advice about what to do on the plane. Unless you are going straight to dinner/a meeting/somewhere important as soon as you get off the plane, don't wear or bother taking makeup on the plane. You'll save yourself baggage space in your carry on and you can sleep and rub your eyes as much as you want on the 20+ hour flight.  Do take moisturizer on the plane, and if you tend to get itchy or tired eyes, an eye spray like OptiMist. Not taking makeup on the plane also means you can take full sized everything, because you don't have to adhere to the liquid rules they have in plane cabins."
AustralianMakeup,2uq3xb,marleycats,4,Wed Feb 4 05:28:37 2015 UTC,"Hi! I'm going to Europe again for 2 months soon too.  In my kit is:  1 x travel sized Lancome mascara - I save all my GWP mascaras (unused) for this purpose  1 x travel sized Lancome eye pencil (same deal as above)  1 x YSL liquid liner (the one in the gold tube... it has the BEST pigment)  Essense 'Soo Glow' cheek highlighter  Nars 'Narsissist' cheek pallette (it has Orgasm blush, Laguna bronzer and an amazing highlight powder in a tiny pallette with a travel sized brush)   La Roche Posay melt-in BB cream (comes in a small tube - very travel friendly)  Kevyn Aucoin brow pencil  That's it!"
AustralianMakeup,2uq3xb,Flippantry,3,Wed Feb 4 07:31:03 2015 UTC,"I was insistent on taking my mineral and sweet almond oil for cleansing and makeup removal!  To make sure it didn't create magical oily chaos, I saw a tip about unscrewing a little bottle lid, putting some cling wrap over it and screwing the lid back on, it worked amazingly well, very minimal mess.  I know it might be hard to do that with coconut oil since it loves to just get all slabby but if you have any other oils that your skin is okay with, it might be worth taking a mini bottle :D   On top of that, I brought my Chi Chi nudes (because I wouldnt be terribly upset if it got a bit banged up in travel and it's quite versatile).  Mini bottle of Missha BB Cream, Little pot of Nude by Nature powder, I utilised all the Benefit mini's I'd collected (so if you've got any samples of things, they're good to chuck in)   I ended up repacking pretty much most of my products, there's a Daiso-like $2.80 store here with amazing little tubs and mini bottles that made it much easier to fit things into the international limits.   As for the flight itself, I'd pretty much not wear any makeup or very minimal at most.  I personally didn't find it terribly drying (although my longest flight was 16 hours rather than 21).  If you've got a sheet mask and aren't afraid to use it, I'd suggest wearing that about halfway through the flight and let it soak in its moistury goodness!"
AustralianMakeup,2uq3xb,mr-snrub-,6,Wed Feb 4 06:15:02 2015 UTC,I took all my makeup when I went to Europe... for some reason I thought I would need 37 lipsticks.    Don't do that Haha.
AustralianMakeup,2uq3xb,Tea_inthegoodroom,2,Wed Feb 4 10:43:17 2015 UTC,"Eyeshadow quads (bareMinerals) and cheek palettes (UD Naked Flush) are the only specific differences I can think of for travel make up. I used makeup remover wipes and travel size eye makeup remover (W cosmetics) plus my normal foaming face wash. Although I'll probably try decanting makeup removing balm and see how that goes.   For a 21h flight I'd probably go on bare face with vaseline, oil cleanser, sheet mask and maybe a sleeping pack. Eyedrops, hand sanitizer and hand cream are essential for me as well :)"
AustralianMakeup,2uq3xb,kittenishgirl,2,Wed Feb 4 05:57:31 2015 UTC,"Skincare- Decanting into smaller containers would make it easier if your normal products are huge. Make sure they are well cleaned and secured properly though. I thought I had on my last trip but my cleansing oil ended up with a huge hard glob in it 3 days in so I had to throw it out - ew! Since all my products are in fairly decent sized bottles with clips/good lids I just put the full size ones in my check-in, in a plastic bag just in case. Too much of a hassle in the end to decant haha!  For carry-on and flying, I too never bother with putting on make up. All my make up is in my carry-on though so if I decide I want to look nicer when I get off the plane I can do it before landing. So my baggy has my favourite foundation/BB cream, mascara, lip balm, MLBB lipstick, eyeliner, hand moisturiser and sheet mask. My normal bag has one eyeshadow palette (nudes makes it easy), powder, blush and essential brushes. Keep it really simple and if you feel like having red lips one night just pop into a shop and pick one up! Gotta love buying Loreal lipsticks for less in Europe lol. I bought one that was 6 euros and it was almost $25 at home!"
AustralianMakeup,2uq3xb,ComingUpMilhouse,2,Wed Feb 4 07:55:03 2015 UTC,"Just don't carry any creams or liquids with into Australia with a container size bigger than the allowed amount (put it in your checked luggage). Coming home from Thailand my mum was told to throw out a face wash, so I ended up squeezing a lot of it into a clear plastic bag, it was ridiculous."
AustralianMakeup,2uq3xb,kittenishgirl,2,Wed Feb 4 08:47:20 2015 UTC,"Well to be fair, that rule has been around for years. Lucky we don't have to do it domestically anymore though (they still do in the US!)"

AustralianMakeup,2uq3xb,kittenishgirl,1 point,Wed Feb 4 09:05:58 2015 UTC,"Ohh yes I understand. And to make sure it's definitely a 100mL bottle only. You can't even use a half filled 150mL bottle, etc."
AustralianMakeup,2uq3xb,ComingUpMilhouse,2,Wed Feb 4 09:07:52 2015 UTC,"I brought the Illamasqua Aura palette overseas with me because it is a multipurpose kit. I also brought mixable lipsticks, a black eyeliner, a mascara (which ended up being brown and I learned in a pinch I can use it on my brows), foundation and a powder. Oh and I took the Japonesque brush tube with me, I don't think those brushes are as soft as I'd like them to be but they're very convenient for travel.  I think skincare does depend on your needs but I suggest putting products in smaller containers and sealing individual items in plastic clip sealed bags. That way if anything leaks you can still use it from the bag."
AustralianMakeup,2uq3xb,_yoshiii,1 point,Wed Feb 4 08:51:00 2015 UTC,"Yup, especially this for the smaller containers. I went to Singapore a couple months ago and with the completely different climate I decided to pop all separate skincare items in their own sandwich ziplock bag. Nothing leaked thankfully and I had a pretty shaky flight."
AustralianMakeup,2uq3xb,full_boyle,2,Wed Feb 4 13:28:35 2015 UTC,"I know your pain, especially 'cos I had to adhere to the strict 3-1-1 liquids rule since I did carry-on for 3 months around Europe.   Took stuff that could multi-task where possible and solid alternatives. I took 100ml of jojoba oil that I could use to moisturise my face and ends of my hair (and my body if need be). I also had a Lush solid shampoo, which I also used to wash my body. I used those solid wax deodorants instead of aerosol. There was also stuff I was willing to buy and leave behind when I left a city, like body moisturiser 'cos it can be really cheap over there. I 100% recommend taking dry shampoo with you as well.  I also weened myself off makeup and hair products a couple of months before I left so I wouldn't want to wear a lot of it when over there. Makeup-wise, I only took mascara, concealer, blush, brow powder + gel and a couple of lipsticks + lip balms. Otherwise, I met people who brought mini MU palettes. Backpacking is actually what made me stop using hairspray completely now. I found a sea salt spray was perfect for styling my hair. I decanted my fave perfume into a mini travel atomiser.  By the way, you'll find that most place offer bodywash already in the shower. Or if you're staying in hostels, some other backpacker has left a bottle behind.  I think I ended up taking jojoba oil, solid shampoo, mini bottle of moisturiser (and re-bought over there when needed), sea salt spray, sunscreen, wax deodorant, minimal makeup and MU remover, mini perfume and hand cream."
AustralianMakeup,2uq3xb,Zapookie,2,Thu Feb 5 10:13:53 2015 UTC,"I like to bring a small makeup bag with my essentials. Foundation, powder, mascara, a small quad or palette + a few brushes. The palette I can use for eyeshadow as well as filling in my brows. You can also use mascara as liquid eyeliner on an angled brush if you wish.  For skin care, I grab a wad of cotton rounds and put them in a small Body Shop body butter container that I emptied, and thoroughly soak them in alcohol free witch hazel (Thayers rose formula). Its really great for refreshing your face after a long flight. I bring a heavy mosturiser that has been depotted into a tiny screw top pot, which I slather on my face an hour or two after take off. I also bring pawpaw ointment which I put on my lips and sometimes up my nose because my sinuses tend to dry out from the recycled air."

AustralianMakeup,2uonxh,Ambstadam,1 point,Sat Feb 7 03:20:36 2015 UTC,I dont think I saw the lip paint. I got the Mud lip stick things and lots of Essence lipsticks. I did get an Ultra black lipstick. Unfortunately I had an unpleasant experience while checking out. The guy didnt have a clue about what makeup was what. He overcharged me $15 and when I politely corrected him he cracked it and got someone else to serve me. He was pretty rude and seemed really frustrated. I just didnt want to get overcharged. However the sale was great. I am set for the year now.

I wasn't super tempted by them to begin with as I think their prices are ridonkulous for a start for a company who is relatively unknown to the general public.

It can vary so so wildly that unless you have 4-6 weeks up your sleeve there's a huge chance you may not get it in time. I have had things from the US take 2 weeks before, 3-4 weeks and 5+ weeks. You can't ever bank on either country's postal services being prompt unfortunately unless you choose an express option!"
AustralianMakeup,2umzl5,Jessijames,8,Tue Feb 3 22:44:36 2015 UTC,Anything coming from the US will be 3-6 weeks.

I let Benefit know and they kept suggesting I wait longer for the package and after 8 weeks I was really annoyed. I didn't receive it and contacted Benefit and they were kind enough to send me replacement.
AustralianMakeup,2umzl5,babytigress,4,Wed Feb 4 06:51:51 2015 UTC,I did an order about 2 months ago now and it took 3 weeks as well with the free shipping. They're pretty slow so I wouldn't count on getting it on time.

AustralianMakeup,2uhyxt,smilingsunbeams,8,Mon Feb 2 08:19:55 2015 UTC,Hourglass ambient lighting powder is amazing! i love it its like photoshop in a powder haha.   Nars primer is also brilliant. It helps keep my makeup on all day and is very lightweight and also fills in my pours.  Viseart Everything from them are a must have! the palletes are beautiful and buttery dream to blend too  Eyeko brow gel and mascaras are something i cannot live without! My eyebrows always stay in place now and the mascaras actually hold a curl and do not smurge and give me panda eyes.

Loose shadows take a bit of practice to get used, but so worth it once you get the hang of it.   With glitter glue - the trick is to pat on a teeny bit/thin layer to start with, then let it dry for a 30 seconds so that it's tacky but not too tacky. Then you pat your shadows on where you want the shimmer to appear. Again, it's all practice so don't freak out if you don't get it right first go! :) Less is more with glitter glue.  Edit - not sure where you're based, but I remember Myer Mecca in Sydney Pitt St had it. I had to ask for it though, but the sales girl found one for me in storage."

AustralianMakeup,2ucl48,dancepantz,1 point,Sun Feb 1 14:48:10 2015 UTC,"Do you think you could knock up an estimate table? Like, take the prices of the naked palettes or vice etc and then do the exchange rate + tax as above. It won't be totally accurate, but hopefully we can get a ballpark idea? This one was pretty close after all :)"
AustralianMakeup,2ucl48,oncewerewild,3,Mon Feb 2 13:51:03 2015 UTC,Oh wow your table is handy!! Well once I see the conversions it seems like the prices are pretty fair compared to US yay!
AustralianMakeup,2ucl48,chocolatespeckle,3,Sat Jan 31 23:07:43 2015 UTC,Thanks :) Yes at the current exchange rate the prices do seem quite fair! Especially factoring in shipping and wait time for online purchases.
AustralianMakeup,2ucl48,chocolatespeckle,3,Sun Feb 1 09:59:49 2015 UTC,The prices definitely seem more reasonable right now because our dollar is weak. I'll have to add the Beauty Bay prices in a column as well! I didn't think to do that this morning. :)

I'm Asian, have brown black hair and I bought Chocolate. The thing about dipbrow is that its quite pigmented and opaque, and I'm having difficulty avoiding the ""stencilled in/drag brow"" look and making it natural.

AustralianMakeup,2u4txc,Flippantry,1 point,Thu Jan 29 23:24:42 2015 UTC,"My favourite one that I think is vegan-friendly is the Extreme Volume Mascara, looking over the ingredients it all looks to be plant based.  I had this in brown, I wouldn't say it's extreme volume but it was a fairly soft thickening mascara.  I have tiny eyelashes though so I'm never too fussed if something doesn't give me much length or volume because there's not much to cling to!  I really liked the brush shape and size too."

AustralianMakeup,2txijb,TheBrowThrowaway,5,Wed Jan 28 04:53:43 2015 UTC,"Hey guys,  I have been using this home dye kit for a while now and thought I should post about it as I am happy with the results. It's called ""1000 Hour Eyelash & Brow Dye Kit"" and it's available at Woolies for $19.95 in multiple colours. I used brown on my brows and black on my lashes. You get 12 applications per kit so I definitely think it's worth the price!"
AustralianMakeup,2txijb,dinkykate,4,Wed Jan 28 04:56:03 2015 UTC,You can buy this at chemist warehouse for slightly cheaper if you are on a budget :)
AustralianMakeup,2txijb,damn-croissants,2,Thu Jan 29 01:38:26 2015 UTC,Ooh nice I'll have to head there next time
AustralianMakeup,2txijb,thelittlestars,2,Thu Jan 29 04:59:00 2015 UTC,how long does each application last?
AustralianMakeup,2txijb,kdarmy,2,Wed Jan 28 06:42:48 2015 UTC,The application lasts about 3-4 weeks from memory
AustralianMakeup,2txijb,PamPooveyIsTheTits,2,Wed Jan 28 12:17:37 2015 UTC,I tried to use this once and it started burning my eyes so badly I had to take it off. Have you had this problem at all? The results look really good!
AustralianMakeup,2txijb,alyss0r,2,Wed Jan 28 05:32:10 2015 UTC,Thanks!  Yeah I do get some stinging if I apply it too close to the base of my lashes so I try to concentrate the product on the middle to the tip. I find I only really need the dye there anyway as I have blonde tips on my lashes.
AustralianMakeup,2txijb,BlueRainstorm,2,Wed Jan 28 06:20:09 2015 UTC,"So... based on the strength of your review, I headed off to Priceline this morning and purchased Dark Brown for my brows and Blue Black for my eyelashes - they're currently on sale for $15. Just completed my first colouring session and I'm absolutely blown away, it was so easy and the results are amazing!! I usually have my brows & lashes tinted every 6-8 weeks at $40 a session and I feel like sometimes it's not as even or lasting as I'd like it to be, and right now I feel like my lashes are the best they've ever been after my little DIY session! I used the tiniest amount of product (maybe 1/3 of what the instructions suggested) so I think I'll have a years worth of brows & lashes for only $30."
AustralianMakeup,2txijb,Bulbysaur123,1 point,Sat Jan 31 04:38:10 2015 UTC,I always see this and think about picking it up but never do. It looks great! How easy was it to apply on yourself? Did it take long to process?
AustralianMakeup,2tww9y,AgentBloodrayne,2,Wed Jan 28 01:50:45 2015 UTC,"That looks like an amazing range, I'm so jealous! Why wouldn't you take full advantage of the situation?! If I go back to the UK/Europe next year I plan to buy more make up than I'll ever use, just so I can look at it."

AustralianMakeup,2tww9y,Haibarai,1 point,Wed Jan 28 19:17:50 2015 UTC,Is it alright for me to ask roughly the amount you spent on all of these?
AustralianMakeup,2tww9y,backwards01,3,Wed Jan 28 02:32:08 2015 UTC,"That'd take some serious math on my side, but I'd say definitely at least 150 bucks? The more high end stuff like the Urban Decay and NARS were gifts and I got most things on sale.  The most expensive thing I bought myself was the Kat Von D lipstick which was 26 Canadian dollars (but so worth it because it's a beautiful colour with awesome packaging, can't remember the shade name but it's a sparkly orangey-red).   Most things were under 10 dollars except the Too Faced things which were in a collection together for 26 CAD and a Sephora brand lip cream that was 16 CAD and the OCC mini lip tars were only 12 CAD :)  Edit: a misspelling"
AustralianMakeup,2txzvk,breviloquent-,3,Wed Jan 28 08:10:30 2015 UTC,A few weeks ago I saw this post on the MeNow Generation liquid lipsticks and saw the swatches and decided to get some for myself. Theyre $1.3 on ebay (and I think BeautyBohemia might sell it for around $5/6?) and so so so opaque. I literally got them twenty minutes ago so I cant really comment on anything else except for how hard it was to remove...this was after two soaked swipes of micellar water but you could probably read the linked post for a detailed review  SHADES FROM TOP TO BOTTOM 08  22  20  02  EDIT : Probably took 12 days to ship to me in Sydney

AustralianMakeup,2txzvk,PamPooveyIsTheTits,3,Wed Feb 4 13:32:30 2015 UTC,The trick to getting these off without scrubbing the heck out of your poor lips is oil.. Even olive oil will do the trick.. That's the best way I have found to remove them easily :)  They are definitely a bit drying like most lipsticks of this type but they're great when you have a long day and want your lippy to just stay put. :)
AustralianMakeup,2txzvk,babytigress,1 point,Wed Jan 28 11:07:22 2015 UTC,I love those colours. How do they feel on your lips?
AustralianMakeup,2txzvk,kitz_bambi,1 point,Wed Jan 28 08:56:21 2015 UTC,Haven't tried them yet but will update when I do!
AustralianMakeup,2txzvk,Saffrin,1 point,Wed Jan 28 09:01:20 2015 UTC,Thanks! I would love to know how they wear and whether they dry out your lips or flake when you've tried them out
AustralianMakeup,2txzvk,kitz_bambi,1 point,Wed Jan 28 10:09:55 2015 UTC,Do you have the link for them? Thanks :)
AustralianMakeup,2txzvk,kitz_bambi,1 point,Wed Jan 28 11:54:19 2015 UTC,"Here.  It's just the eBay search for them, sorted and buy now only. The top few are a different thing, but some places have only most colours and are cheaper, and a few more have all colours and are a tiny bit more expensive."
AustralianMakeup,2txzvk,Saffrin,1 point,Wed Jan 28 15:30:41 2015 UTC,Thanks for that!
AustralianMakeup,2tx1k9,Ienjoylongwalks,2,Wed Jan 28 02:32:13 2015 UTC,I didn't think Priceline even stocked them! They're weirdly absent from all of the Aus websites.

AustralianMakeup,2tx1k9,criticalenemy,1 point,Thu Jan 29 05:39:19 2015 UTC,I bought one from Parramatta today. They don't have a permanent stand but if you ask someone they actually had stock! I picked up the pink but there was heaps of red left.
AustralianMakeup,2tx1k9,crispy_pork_chop,1 point,Thu Jan 29 07:16:27 2015 UTC,I just picked up Napa Vineyard from the Priceline in Exhibition St (Melb). There were heaps left. Now I regret not picking up more since the discount makes them very affordable.
AustralianMakeup,2txivu,jellabear26,2,Wed Jan 28 04:57:12 2015 UTC,"I'm an NC15 with combination skin, currently I've got terrible dry patches :(. I've got studio fix fluid and few lipsticks from MAC and love the formula so I'll check those out, thanks! Any products that are your favourites?"
AustralianMakeup,2txivu,SEXPILUS,2,Wed Jan 28 05:39:35 2015 UTC,I bought a setting spray but it doesn't do much for my eyeshadows so I'll look into fix plus!  Thanks for all the suggestions! I'll have to go into MAC and swatch all the lipsticks now :)
AustralianMakeup,2txivu,Brittanylouise92,3,Wed Jan 28 06:01:40 2015 UTC,"Just a heads up, Fix+ isn't a setting spray, it's a finishing spray. So it won't lock down your makeup, but it does make it look more skin-like and less powdery. Also great for hydrating your face and refreshing makeup throughout the day."
AustralianMakeup,2txivu,pyjamasquid,1 point,Wed Jan 28 06:27:29 2015 UTC,Off topic but when you say NC15 what exactly is it you're referring to and how do I know what my skin is?
AustralianMakeup,2txivu,Brittanylouise92,1 point,Wed Jan 28 09:25:12 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but NC15 and similar numbers that you'll see come from MAC's foundations! They're used by a lot of people as a universal way to describe skintone - I don't know why people use MAC specifically, but I presume as it's pretty easy and common for people to get matched there. NC means you're of a warm skintone, and NW means cool (it helps if you think of them as ""not warm"" and ""not cool"") so for example you can get foundations in NC15, which is a warm pale colour and in NW15, which is the same shade but cool-toned. The higher the number, the darker the colour; and they go from about 15-55.  Note: Most of MAC's foundations (Studio Fix Fluid, Mineralize, etc.) are numbered this way but some of them aren't, which is weird. For instance, Face and Body is just ""C"" or ""N"" and the numbering goes from 1-9."
AustralianMakeup,2txivu,pyjamasquid,2,Wed Jan 28 11:42:05 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I'm tempted to go and find out what mine would be, but then I'll probably get roped into buying something :p   It does all make more sense now."
AustralianMakeup,2txivu,Brittanylouise92,1 point,Thu Jan 29 00:29:07 2015 UTC,"You're welcome! If you end up in MAC, I recommend getting a match - it's really useful to be able to compare things to. Whenever I'm interested in a particular product, I can google its name and my MAC number, and I can look at other people's pictures to see what it would look like on my approximate skintone.   You could use something like Findation to get a rough idea of what you'd be, if that's helpful - put in as many of your current foundation matches as you can, and it should be able to give you a close match."
AustralianMakeup,2txivu,breviloquent-,1 point,Thu Jan 29 03:19:39 2015 UTC,I'm going to do this when I get home! Thanks :)
AustralianMakeup,2txivu,becabecaful,1 point,Thu Jan 29 03:41:21 2015 UTC,They're MAC shades. You can go to a counter and get tested
AustralianMakeup,2txivu,becabecaful,2,Thu Jan 29 03:54:36 2015 UTC,"I'm NC15 too. My faves are Lipsticks and blushes. My fave blushes atm are Melba, Dainty and Peachykeen. I'm wearing a lot of the Creamsheen lip glass too, such an easy non-sticky gloss for summer. I can't remember what colour off the top of my head but it's a nude one."

AustralianMakeup,2txzs2,RuthlessRagdoll,1 point,Wed Jan 28 08:10:10 2015 UTC,So it spins? (Double checking because ivd been conned before)
AustralianMakeup,2txzs2,SEXPILUS,1 point,Wed Jan 28 21:52:11 2015 UTC,Yes it has two speeds.
AustralianMakeup,2txzs2,spitey,1 point,Thu Jan 29 02:17:04 2015 UTC,"Most cleansing brushes don't spin, they use sonic movement. This includes the Clarisonic. A spinning brush would be too harsh for delicate facial skin.   Edit: I just realised I'm not actually sure whether you wanted it to spin or not. Either way, if this one spins then it's probably not that good."

AustralianMakeup,2ts03q,UndecidedUser,3,Tue Jan 27 05:30:57 2015 UTC,Factoring in the exchange rate onto that and it's probably not far off Beauty Bay anyway!

Like I said yesterday if its on par with Beauty Bay if not better then I'll be happy.

AustralianMakeup,2tssvc,damn-croissants,1 point,Tue Jan 27 04:06:35 2015 UTC,"The price is a major winning factor! And I am loving the lip pencil I decided to use today - it's still going strong four hours on with no fading, and it hardly transfers now it's sort of set, but my lips don't feel dry."

AustralianMakeup,2tssvc,jamballdonut,1 point,Tue Jan 27 06:42:19 2015 UTC,"How did you enjoy the pencil? Thinking I may give in & buy one to include in my (too large) jumbo lip pencil collection.  I'm sure I can find a shade that I ""need"".  EDIT: Holy gosh, I did NOT see that they're $10! I thought I saw somewhere that they were $16.95!! Well, now I definitely DO need one or 5 or something."
AustralianMakeup,2tssvc,szarkasm,1 point,Wed Jan 28 08:18:10 2015 UTC,I really enjoyed it! They're small but they pack a punch. I'll be tempted to look at ther shades.

AustralianMakeup,2tt5ev,Mikhaila,13,Tue Jan 27 05:06:49 2015 UTC,I don't hear about Natio products much. I have the skin brightening face balm which gives me a nice subtle glow on it's own or under foundation. I like their liquid foundation and love their lip smoothie crayons.
AustralianMakeup,2tt5ev,tallulahblue,1 point,Tue Jan 27 07:43:20 2015 UTC,I've only ever tried their skin care I never really thought of trying any of their makeup before. I might have to give the foundation a go!
AustralianMakeup,2tt5ev,minax128,1 point,Tue Jan 27 11:31:42 2015 UTC,"I've gone through 2 bottles of their liquid mineral foundation, loved it! The pressed powder was okay, nothing special though."
AustralianMakeup,2tt5ev,Haibarai,2,Wed Jan 28 00:03:53 2015 UTC,Is it just me or do their foundations smell terrible?
AustralianMakeup,2tt5ev,Flippantry,1 point,Wed Jan 28 08:04:04 2015 UTC,I've noticed it too.  One of my Natio foundations started to smell like mothballs just weeks after opening it!

AustralianMakeup,2tt5ev,tallulahblue,1 point,Wed Jan 28 22:51:48 2015 UTC,Me too! I got Tea Rose and Petal in a set and I find myself reaching for Tea Rose almost every day.
AustralianMakeup,2tt5ev,crossesafimelb,1 point,Thu Jan 29 01:47:40 2015 UTC,"I think youtube makes a huge impact and they don't pay people to review their products. Natio is great as they are Australian and animal friendly. I usually keep an eye out for sales at David Jones and Myer. I have liked their face brightening balm but I go through it too quickly, and the face powders and foundations have all worked well with my oily, sensitive skin."
AustralianMakeup,2tt5ev,tallulahblue,2,Thu Jan 29 03:05:16 2015 UTC,"This is true.   I may be mistaken, but I don't think MAC cosmetics sends products to YouTubers, yet YouTubers still use MAC products all the time so that's how I know it is probably good quality stuff. (I think it tests on animals though which isn't good).   I'm sure there are other similar brands. Maybe Urban Decay? YouTubers love it but they don't seem to be saying ""This was sent to me""."
AustralianMakeup,2tt5ev,mackinnon_13,1 point,Thu Jan 29 05:55:15 2015 UTC,I think MAC is a gateway mid-high end brand for many people getting into makeup and they also provide an excellent reference point in terms of skin colour. MAC does send out product samples to some youtubers just as they do to bloggers but just not to the same extent of many brands. Also many new and upcoming brands will send out products to get exposure- MAC obviously does not need exposure.
AustralianMakeup,2tt5ev,sydneysomething,5,Fri Jan 30 08:11:44 2015 UTC,"I have the illamasqua metallix cream eyeshadow in bibelot and oh my frackin' Cthulhu, it's so amazing and so easy to use. I find powder eyeshadows impossible to use now that I've been using all these cream/gel ones. Sigh, but all the pretty colours come in powder palettes.   Also I've just recently tried the rimmel lash accelerator and I'm loving it. It doesn't guess me that natural look like cover girl did (fuck you and not meshing well with my eyes, cover girl) but my lashes look soooo long. I could probably put another one on after for a bit more volume but having very short lashes I'm more after length than anything else.   Also I just got a smashbox crease brush and I love it but I never hear anything about smashbox brushes shrug"
AustralianMakeup,2tt5ev,sydneysomething,2,Tue Jan 27 05:54:31 2015 UTC,I just had a look at bibelot it looks so nice such a beautiful colour and the packaging looks really nice too! How have I never heard of these?  I've not heard anything about the smashbox brushes either so I'll have to check them out aswell.
AustralianMakeup,2tt5ev,iammay,2,Tue Jan 27 06:31:23 2015 UTC,The 'Once' collection from illa was kinda small I guess? I saw bibelot and knew I needed it and now every time I can an email from them I'm like..hmm should I get the other colours? :p I wish they'd bring out an entire range in that formula.
AustralianMakeup,2tt5ev,Artemisian11,2,Tue Jan 27 07:03:38 2015 UTC,I was looking at the nude colour and thinking I need that in my life.
AustralianMakeup,2tt5ev,jamballdonut,5,Tue Jan 27 07:18:34 2015 UTC,"I really love my Maybelline hyper glossy liquid eyeliner. It's both smudge proof and water proof and it lasts all day (literally 24 hours) in Brisbane's heat and when I'm at work. I suppose because it isn't matte it doesn't get much love, but it's a really great product considering how cheap it is (something like $9 when it's full price)."
AustralianMakeup,2tt5ev,mackinnon_13,3,Wed Jan 28 02:36:44 2015 UTC,"Yessssssssss. I bought this randomly in a sale, and I love it. Wear it literally every single day. Like you said, shit does. not. move. I even have some difficulty getting it off with coconut oil. I don't mind the glossy, I think it looks kind of nifty, and I'm in love with the super-fine application - I have shaky hands, and it's perfect for me."
AustralianMakeup,2tt5ev,jamballdonut,5,Wed Jan 28 21:00:22 2015 UTC,"I've been loooooooooooooooving the Australis Voluptulash recently.  It's a tube mascara, so it doesn't add any volume, & clumps VERY easily, but it's waterproof and makes my lashes look long, and is surprisingly easy to remove.  Definitely worth the investment.  Another amazing Australis product would DEFINITELY be their Cray For Colour Jumbo Eye Pencils (silly name, but amazing product).  500x better than the NYX ones.  These ones don't crease on my ridiculously oily eyelids, they're pigmented, smooth, easy to blend.  Everything you want.  Disappointed in the shade range, but I have the taupe shade (Spoiling The Fun, I think it is?) and the purple (Something Plum or something, I dunno) and I use the taupe one most days that I wear eyeshadow.  AMAZING."
AustralianMakeup,2tt5ev,ComingUpMilhouse,1 point,Wed Jan 28 08:30:18 2015 UTC,I really like the Australis eyeshadow crayons too! I hesitate to spend money on cream shadows of any kind really because I gravitate towards powders by and large but these are really good and cheap enough that I feel zero guilt about buying them and maybe not using them before they dry up!
AustralianMakeup,2tt5ev,trignometry,1 point,Fri Jan 30 08:15:21 2015 UTC,"Yeees! I loooove Soiling The Fun, and use it as a base for my shadows.  It doesn't crease, doesn't move, and blends so easily.  I can already tell I'm going to own the full collection soon!"
AustralianMakeup,2tt5ev,ComingUpMilhouse,5,Sat Jan 31 02:17:40 2015 UTC,"Trying to think of things that don't have much hype, my day wear foundation is Boots No 7 in Stay Perfect. I've never been able to buy it in Aus but it's the only lightweight foundation that I've loved that suits my neutral, pale skin. My heavy wear foundation is Kryolan TV Paint Stick and it is amazing. It's the perfect match for me, they have a really wide colour selection and that foundation does not budge. I've worn it in so many sweaty situations in which I'd expect my oily, sweaty skin to make my foundation patchy but hours later it's still good. I bought the Kryolan in Melbourne, The Emporium mall IRRC."
AustralianMakeup,2tt5ev,crossesafimelb,1 point,Tue Jan 27 08:37:18 2015 UTC,It's a shame the boots one isn't available here I would definitely give it a go. I'm still trying to find a foundation I really love.

AustralianMakeup,2tt5ev,Rinswirl,3,Tue Jan 27 10:55:14 2015 UTC,I have this exact mascara. I got it for a bargain price too. I agree it's a great formula.
AustralianMakeup,2tt5ev,breviloquent-,1 point,Tue Jan 27 07:09:43 2015 UTC,I really love it as an everyday mascara.
AustralianMakeup,2tt5ev,backwards01,2,Tue Jan 27 07:19:15 2015 UTC,I switch between it and the Lush mascara I scored from the Boxing Day sales.
AustralianMakeup,2tt5ev,smilingsunbeams,5,Tue Jan 27 07:24:52 2015 UTC,Nyx doll eyes mascara (both volume and length versions).  I feel like NYX blushes and lipsticks get all the love but their mascara is my HG
AustralianMakeup,2tt5ev,milkiebuttle,1 point,Tue Jan 27 10:15:02 2015 UTC,I've never heard much about their mascara either. I'll have to give it a go next time I'm near a target.
AustralianMakeup,2trty8,backwards01,3,Mon Jan 26 22:41:51 2015 UTC,"Hopefully I won't be tempted to pick up anything. I tend to go overboard on 'drugstore' skincare and never use half of it because I  A. Have too much & B. half of it doesn't work for me. I am slowly trying to whittle down what I have in my bathroom cupboards, but I have also gone back to my Lush skincare routine that has worked well for me in the past and my skin has been fantastic of late for it!

AustralianMakeup,2trty8,criti_biti,2,Tue Jan 27 13:05:10 2015 UTC,"I like to use their magaminty mask. The cooling sensational is perfect for a humid, brisbane summer. Unfortunately, I find that the mask doesn't brighten as much if you use it too often."
AustralianMakeup,2trty8,HoliShitBatman,1 point,Tue Jan 27 17:15:34 2015 UTC,"I use their Gorgeous Moisturizer, really expensive, but it works wonders for dry skin. It clears up most of my discolouration (mind you, it's quite mild) and brightens my skin without foundation. I was lucky enough to grab it during the Boxing Day sales."
AustralianMakeup,2trty8,Laurensics,3,Wed Jan 28 13:45:00 2015 UTC,"In the email I got this morning from them it says ""skin care, sun care and tanning"" - so I think you'll be in luck regarding sunscreen!"

AustralianMakeup,2trjno,Jessijames,6,Mon Jan 26 21:28:11 2015 UTC,"My skin lingers somewhere between oily and normal year round. Generally, I re-conceal (any redness that's started showing through, which is almost always has) and powder, and then use a setting spray (I use the NYX setting sprays at the moment). My brows and eyes have usually survived but I might give myself a slightly larger wing if I can be bothered or it suits the look.   And of course as someone who owns as many lipsticks as I do, I usually wear somewhere between one and five every day, so if I'm going out I'll usually pick something a bit funkier -if I've been at work - or a bit more classic if I've been having a weird lipstick day, also depending on the level of formality of whatever I'm going to."
AustralianMakeup,2trjno,sarkata,2,Tue Jan 27 00:41:16 2015 UTC,"I very rarely fix my makeup to go out, as I figure it is dark and so long as my mascara is still on, I'll be fine. I might use a bit of concealer under the eyes to look more awake. Top up the lipstick.  I have dry skin, so I'll spray either UD All Nighter Setting Spray or Mario Badescu Facial Spray (smells like turkish delight!) to get a bit of dewiness back.  My nose tends to lose foundation first, as it is slightly oily, so I sometimes carry a compact of physicians formula foundation around to cover the nose back up.  If I am wearing MAC Face and Body, it is fine with being topped up.  TL;DR foundation compact on nose, focus on increasing contrast by adding lippie and checking mascara, some sort of face spray for ""reawakening"" skin, and conceal the tired eyes."
AustralianMakeup,2trjno,One_of_a_Kind,2,Mon Jan 26 23:41:22 2015 UTC,"I have oily skin too! I have mastered the foundation routine in only 5 mins so if my foundation is far too gone i use a quick makeup remover wipe then go back on top with my primer and foundation, concealer,powder then add some blush. Then depending on what eye makeup i had on during the day, i either darken it up and create a light smokey eye, or if i wore a cat liner i extend the wing and do a quick bright lip.   Also if i know im going out at night ill actually bring some products along with me so that just before i leave work i top up my foundation so that way when im home i can spend a tiny bit more time on my eyes.   Another go to look ill do if im in a super rush is retouch my base and mascara, then add a creme neural colour (mac paintpot, chanel illusion dom something along those lines) just to add some colour then do a red lip or pink lip."
AustralianMakeup,2trjno,SparkleMUA,2,Tue Jan 27 00:40:31 2015 UTC,"I do have that trouble with finding pigmented powders too, I have one form Inglot that isn't too orange on me, but I am keen to swatch the new NARS Soft Velvet Loose Powder when Mecca eventually begin to stock it (& the new NARS foundation, so excite).

Seriously though you can try these things:   Reorganise your collection.  Swatch your collection. Make it a mission to hit pan on some of your products.  Make it your mission to give some of your existing products the love that they deserve. Before you buy something check for dupes that you already own or if you own something that would fit the same use. Consider the expiry dates of your current collection. Take photos of your collection. Write a spreadsheet/list of what you have in your collection. Set yourself a mission to try new looks with existing products and expand yourself using what you already have.   Stuff like that. /r/MakeupRehab is in the sidebar if you want to talk about your no-buy progress."

AustralianMakeup,2tpozr,Tonkie,3,Tue Jan 27 07:14:58 2015 UTC,"Definitely check out /r/MakeupRehab! It's a super supportive community and there's a LOT of tips on how to stick to a no-buy/low-buy and just generally appreciate and use your makeup in different ways. There's a fantastic link called ""NoBuy/LowBuy Crash Course"" in the sidebar which should help you. Also check out the challenges the community participates in - there's a weekly empties thread to encourage you to work on panning items and you can also set yourself a Project Pan or a Pan that Palette challenge.  This year I set myself on a low-buy with the goal of just enjoying the makeup I already have and looking at new ways to use it, rather than always looking for the next new shiny thing to buy. First step I established was creating an inventory/spreadsheet, which I completed last week and I've found it's already helped me say no to a lot of potential makeup purchases. I rediscovered so much makeup I forgot I even owned, gave a lot to friends, tossed some old items, and it just hit me how much I already owned. I'd really recommend you also do an inventory! It can combine a lot of the tips /u/ComingUpMilhouse suggested - reorganising and swatching, considering expiring dates, checking for dupes, and taking photos. All depending on how detailed you want to make your inventory. Plus it's a lot of fun just looking through all the lovely makeup you already have.  Good luck :)"
AustralianMakeup,2tpozr,chocolatespeckle,1 point,Mon Jan 26 14:16:49 2015 UTC,"I love hanging around Makeup Rehab.  I've done a lot of things they suggest, organise your makeup so you see how much you have, create an inventory, research before you buy, swatch everything, and keep a record of what you pan.  I've been doing a project pan and posting it to Pinterest with the date I finished it, if I liked it or not, why, etc. I just try limit spending by saying ""you know foundation takes at least 3 months to use up"", ""you didn't like that brand last time"", ""you already have three moisturising creams in your use up pile"", etc. It's been really helpful for me.  I also found simply using and enjoying what I own helped me limit what I spend."
AustralianMakeup,2tpozr,One_of_a_Kind,5,Tue Jan 27 02:58:24 2015 UTC,"I'm really really bad with not buying makeup, but lately I've decided to go cruelty free on all brands, sooo that means I'm now on a project pan of all my animal testing brands!  It also means when Maybelline or Rimmel release a new product I can look at it and go ""WELP, NOT UNTIL YOU STOP TESTING ON ANIMALS"" and silently rage inside my head that I can't own it.  Another thing I do is little challenges to finish products (so project pans, really) and then if I finish it, then wooh! Go me! I get a treat.  (Generally a new makeup item that I've really really wanted).  I'm actually going to be starting a new thing that I'm not allowed to buy a new item until I finish 5! (I'm never going to be buying makeup again!)  I also re-organise my makeup collection practically once a month (I get bored easily) and it makes me rediscover products I haven't used in ages, so they get put to the front/in my project pan, and this continues until I re-organise my collection again and rediscover even more new items!! (I'm re-organising my collection today, so let's see how this goes!)  I also recently started following ""dupethat"" (I think, I'll have to check when I have my phone near me) which helps me realise I already have shades similar to ones I want! (Such as the new MAC Miley Cyrus lipstick being SO SIMILAR to MAC Impassioned which is almost identical to Chi Chi ""Almost Famous"" (I think!) and Chi Chi is also cruelty free! Win for me!)"

AustralianMakeup,2tpozr,damn-croissants,3,Sat Jan 31 02:17:04 2015 UTC,"one thing that really helped me was to make a spreadsheet with all of my makeup. not only did it help me to clean out and organise, it also ensured that I know exactly what I have and need to use before I go out any buy anything new.   another way that works for me but might not for others is watching collection videos on youtube - especially people with huge collections like shaaanxo, dulce and tarababyz (who has 2 hour long collection videos!). I find that they just make me kinda anxious about accumulating makeup just for the sake of having it and also I can live vicariously through them"
AustralianMakeup,2tpozr,cherry_cocopops,1 point,Tue Jan 27 01:32:52 2015 UTC,Lol those clips are so confronting/disturbing- they force me to acknowledge that this level of product lust is unhealthy & I would never want to get to that point
AustralianMakeup,2tpozr,aditim28,3,Tue Jan 27 14:51:17 2015 UTC,"I'm a broke (now graduated) student...   But I also look at reviews of  products and wait for a few months, and if I still really want it, I buy it.   Also a lot of things don't suit me because of my skin tone, and I'm fairly picky about what I like."
AustralianMakeup,2tpozr,phattoes,3,Mon Jan 26 12:46:40 2015 UTC,I tried by locking myself in my apartment. But I started having blackouts and then it was as if my makeup would multiply by itself.
AustralianMakeup,2tpozr,reddit-g,3,Tue Jan 27 00:00:20 2015 UTC,"I think a good starting point is reviewing your collection and making a list of selection criteria for what you're going to keep. This way you can look and see how much of a certain thing you already don't use enough and really can't be wasting more money on.   A good example in my case is foundation, I probably have about 12 at the moment but I only really rotate between 3 (Make Up Forever HD, Bourjois 123 Perfect & Loreal True Match). Today actually I'm going to go through my ""face"" drawer and pass on or get rid of anything that's been sitting there unused for the past 6 months. Then maybe if you're like me and have a ""want"" list of make up on your phone, delete the things you REALLY don't need more of (I just deleted several foundations off the list and several nude matte lip colours, I already have plenty of those).   This is kind of sounds more like about cleaning things out, but for me having a good sort through of what you already have (and maybe rediscovering some stuff you've hardly used) is a pretty good wake up call."
AustralianMakeup,2tpozr,amyeh,2,Tue Jan 27 00:38:45 2015 UTC,"I don't either, and then I look at what I have and realise that in my lifetime, I will never wear it all. So I feel guilty about how much money I have wasted over the years.  My biggest thing that I do is I reorganise my makeup case. I always end up finding products I forgot I had and I make it my mission to use them next time I do my face. I tend to get into a bit of a rut and use the same things over and over and neglect other great products."
AustralianMakeup,2tpozr,timeteapot,2,Mon Jan 26 12:35:20 2015 UTC,"I agree with everyone's answers here, and myself have done similar to /u/chocolatespeckle - my finished spreadsheet was enough to put me RIGHT off any impulse buys! I also couldn't believe the amount of ""almost"" dupes I had lipstick-wise, which showed me I clearly gravitate towards certain shades, thinking they're totally different than what I have at home. Noooot so much. I gave away or threw out a looot of things, and I still don't miss any of them.  I'd say what helps me the most: look at the pretty things, swatch the pretty things, then go home and mull it over for a few days. Look up more swatches, read reviews. The initial shine of a product you don't REALLY want often wears off quite quickly. If that gives you some trouble, a second thing I often do now is to ask myself, ""can I think of two or more seperate ways to wear this eyeshadow within a minute?"" It forces you to consider what you already own, and how you can make this new thing fit into your collection. If you can't, put it back.  As I'm on a low-buy right now, I have an ongoing wishlist which is full of all the items I want to buy after my low-buy ends in December. I look over it every so often, with the idea that only things I still want just as bad stay on the list - and I've actually crossed half of it off already!  TL;DR give your wants time, and give your wants proper consideration!"
AustralianMakeup,2tpozr,Tea_inthegoodroom,2,Mon Jan 26 17:25:09 2015 UTC,"There are a few impulse buys that I've regretted but kept as a reminder of what happens (sometimes) when I can't control my buying. It settles me down real quick. Then to keep it up, I start to experiment with products that I haven't used in a long time."
AustralianMakeup,2tpozr,panda_bear88,2,Mon Jan 26 18:36:58 2015 UTC,"I understand your issue. I am somewhat of an emotional buyer. If I get stressed I like to browse and buy makeup. But recently I have found shopping my stash helps. I have also found that trying to be proactive in the analysis of my collection, in the many ways already suggested in this thread, has really helped. Now I am on a low buy for the year which has been quite successful. I am only allowed to buy items that have been on my wishlist for a long time, Limited to one purchase a month (not including repurchase of basics when needed). You should check out /r/makeuprehab!"
AustralianMakeup,2tpozr,sarkata,2,Mon Jan 26 21:01:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not on a buying ban, but I have placed myself on a big using-shit-up spree. I used to buy a lot and never use it up, but since I started consciously making an effort to use things  I've definitely progressed a lot - I find that tracking and blogging about my empties is really useful for me, because I find a bit of pride in using things up.  If I'm eyeing something up that I really, really want and it's not just a cheap in-and-out-of-priceline thing, I place it on a list of priority purchases. I have to still be desperate for it after about two weeks (slightly less if it's LE or something that sells out quickly), and I have to measure the money it will cost against the money I know I want to spend on future purchases - so I map out those future purchases. For instance, I currently have a few things scheduled in - I know I'm going to want three of the new Velourlips colours minimum, so there's around $30, and I know I'm going to want one of Chi Chi's new lipsticks to be released soon, so that will cost me around $19. I also want to head to IMATS again this year, so I've started setting aside small amounts because I know that's going to be a $200+ day. I'll also definitely be eyeing up those metallic KVD liquid lipsticks and have no idea what they'll cost me or even if I'll be able to get them shipped/have to wait until they come to Sephora AUS. Taking all that into consideration, I've just allowed myself two of the Anastasia Liquid Lipsticks, but talked myself out of anymore Insomnia Cosmetics or Solstice Scents orders for the time being."

AustralianMakeup,2tpp1v,amyeh,5,Mon Jan 26 12:02:59 2015 UTC,"Rambling about makeup is fun. I must bore my boyfriend as I have no female friends around to rable to.  For things to try: If you've got $100 laying around, Mecca (Mecca Cosmetica, Mecca Maxima, and Kit Cosmetics) do a 1 hour makeup tutorial, redeemable on the day. It would be a good way to find out what colours suit you, some good techniques, stuff like that. I have been meaning to do this for months now and I might get around to it soon...  I don't know if there is a brand I cannot recommend really. What you want to look out for more is what colours and textures suit you. It is a long and fun learning process. I've found people's opinions on brands vary heavily. For instance, I really like the ""mid to high"" range stuff like MAC, Cargo, Stila, Urban Decay, Lorac, NARS, Yves Saint Laurent (YSL), and Estee Lauder. Some people reckon the more expensive and cheaper cosmetics are just the same on them. So that's brands like ELF, Maybelline, Revlon, MUD, Max Factor, Covergirl (I think the last two are the same people, we just get both brands for some reason), W7, Chi Chi, NP Set, and lots more that I cannot remember.  What I reccomend the most when getting into things, is makeup brushes. Invest in something like the Real Techniques brushes (cheapest at iHerb, NOT an affiliate link; or you can empty your wallet at Priceline). I am also a big big fan of Sigma Brushes, I get mine from stvabeauty on eBay.  Make sure you do your best to buy products you will use. I know it is hard when you are starting out. Try before you buy. Or you will end up like a lot of people on /r/MakeupRehab with HUGE and overwhelming collections. I actually really like makeup rehab, good place to find out if things were really worth the hype to individual users over there, lots of comments on how to keep your spending down, reducing your addiction, etc.  Makeup cases... Don't know much about makeup cases. I have one of these Keji drawers from officeworks, and store my brushes in a few cheap pencil tins."
AustralianMakeup,2tpp1v,One_of_a_Kind,5,Mon Jan 26 23:20:26 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much.  I also really like the things I have tried from the mid-to-high brands. I love MAC, especially their eyeshadows and foundation. I have a few Stila bits and pieces. Wanting to try more Urban Decay stuff, I have their primer potion and I'm not convinced. I have a few YSL products that I love, plus some Estee Lauder that I got at one of their warehouse sales. I bought NARS Orgasm a few years ago and it's just sitting at the bottom of my makeup case, I just can't make it work for me.  I have a large collection of brushes picked up over the years, mainly MAC and mainly eyeshadow. I'm looking to diversify.   I've bought some things off iHerb before, so I will have a look at the brushes they have there.   Thank you so much for all of your suggestions, you've been a great help xx"
AustralianMakeup,2tpp1v,yooones,3,Mon Jan 26 23:50:34 2015 UTC,"If you like MAC eyeshadows another good brand to try would be the Makeup Geek ones by marlena. I heard they are really on par quality wise with MAC, some even better and they're only $6USD a pop plus shipping is around $5. They have a really good selection and I've been meaning to buy from their store for a while just building up the funds lol  They also stock beauty blenders if you want to try them.

Works great too. And the wand means you get a thing line to blend out.  I think it was probably a better decision for me to spend a lot less and see if I like cream contouring and if I can grasp how to do the technique before splurging on Chanel. In the past I've gone all out and tried new techniques/products and failed, become disheartened and when I would be able to do it a few months down the product wouldn't be as brand new and would be closer to it's use by date for me to try and use it all up, making a waste.

AustralianMakeup,2toc6n,Lunawinter,1 point,Mon Jan 26 05:05:32 2015 UTC,https://shopping.scoopon.com.au/event/44840/product/11-compartment-acrylic-cosmetics-organiser-73598/?e=beauty
AustralianMakeup,2toc6n,Lunawinter,2,Mon Jan 26 09:23:47 2015 UTC,"Looks decent for $20 :) ($10 p&h) Yeah i'd say my reject shop one is nicer and better value but I haven't seen them in stock since i bought it.   I wouldn't call it a bargain as such, but it is pretty comparable to the best prices for something similar on ebay, that said the waiting time from China would be much longer than scoopon so in that sense it's pretty good!"
AustralianMakeup,2tlrha,crossesafimelb,5,Sun Jan 25 10:27:44 2015 UTC,"Lorac and Stila items are probably your best bet. Just search and then tick amazon.com as the seller in the bar on the side, apparently they will ship internationally. I haven't made an order yet but am waiting for my next pay to get me some pro palettes lawwwwwwwwd.  Otherwise if you want to browse just click the 'makeup' tab, then select amazon.com as the seller."
AustralianMakeup,2tlrha,pootlepower,2,Sun Jan 25 11:14:19 2015 UTC,"Lorac and Stila items are probably your best bet.   Came here to say this. Successfully purchased both brands. Shipping is an ultra cheap US$5-6. Exchange rate sucks. Amazon invoice you in Australian dollars, which saves you from getting a surprise international transaction fee from your bank a few days later.  Usually, if it has the prime tick next to it, it means Amazon is the seller so it actually ships to Australia and for a good price."
AustralianMakeup,2tlrha,One_of_a_Kind,3,Sun Jan 25 23:17:46 2015 UTC,Yes Ive been ticking the shipping to Australia but it doesnt filter products out properly. Ill try Stila thanks :)
AustralianMakeup,2tlrha,prettyreckless11,3,Mon Jan 26 01:45:00 2015 UTC,"Personally I buy my real techniques brushes on Amazon as they are really cheap as add-on items! As for makeup, Lorac and the balm are the only brands that come to mind."
AustralianMakeup,2tlrha,jellabear26,4,Sun Jan 25 12:57:01 2015 UTC,Do these really ship to Australia? They are so much cheaper on Amazon!  edit: They do... aaaand there goes my money.
AustralianMakeup,2tlrha,jellabear26,4,Sun Jan 25 13:37:16 2015 UTC,Exactly my reaction too haha :) Happy shopping!!
AustralianMakeup,2tlrha,One_of_a_Kind,3,Sun Jan 25 14:05:32 2015 UTC,Yes the balm palettes look good. I wish I got them when they were on sale D:
AustralianMakeup,2tlrha,amyeh,3,Sun Jan 25 23:14:56 2015 UTC,"Ohhh, I didn't know the balm Shipped here too. Though, I am having trouble finding things that ship to Australia... probably a good thing, I don't have the space for much more."
AustralianMakeup,2tlrha,One_of_a_Kind,3,Sun Jan 25 23:21:43 2015 UTC,"I saw the balm in DJ's today, if you still have trouble"
AustralianMakeup,2tlrha,amyeh,1 point,Mon Jan 26 11:45:23 2015 UTC,"Which DJ's, if you don't mind me asking? I'm 99% certain they're not at my local one (Tuggerah Westfield). I don't need anything, I just love looking at makeup."
AustralianMakeup,2tlrha,scrubscrub,3,Mon Jan 26 11:50:49 2015 UTC,"I don't mind at all! It was Burwood, NSW."
AustralianMakeup,2tlrha,panda_bear88,2,Mon Jan 26 12:03:58 2015 UTC,"I've never had a successful transaction on amazon myself. Admittedly I've only tried twice and both failed. The items were lost or never sent, is there something I'm doing wrong?"
AustralianMakeup,2tlrha,prettyreckless11,3,Sun Jan 25 21:23:49 2015 UTC,Are you purchasing from Amazon directly?
AustralianMakeup,2tlrha,panda_bear88,3,Sun Jan 25 23:20:19 2015 UTC,Ive only really bought books and box sets when they were on sale and got them within the week. I used to use the Skinstore but I want to do a huge makeup run from Amazon. Im sure just check reviews on the sellers I guess.
AustralianMakeup,2tlrha,scrubscrub,3,Mon Jan 26 01:57:07 2015 UTC,"It's way faster if you buy from Amazon as the seller. To see all the stuff Amazon sells directly, just get into the beauty section and select ""Amazon.com"" from the ""Seller"" option on the left had side bar. I hope that helps."
AustralianMakeup,2tlrha,panda_bear88,2,Mon Jan 26 02:02:56 2015 UTC,I would be buying from a seller within amazon
AustralianMakeup,2tlrha,scrubscrub,2,Mon Jan 26 05:42:32 2015 UTC,Definitely try looking at Amazon as the direct seller and not a third party through Amazon. It makes it much easier if you have a problem.
AustralianMakeup,2tlpwv,Jessijames,3,Sun Jan 25 09:57:10 2015 UTC,Shaved kittttyyyy!
AustralianMakeup,2tlpwv,badassbettie,3,Sun Jan 25 10:13:17 2015 UTC,"Yepp, I have two fur babies and got both of them shaved around New Years for the first time because they're tremendous fluff balls haha  Here are the pictures from the groomer of teh shaved kittehs for the lulz  'Forever unimpressed'"
AustralianMakeup,2tlpwv,badassbettie,2,Sun Jan 25 10:16:50 2015 UTC,"HAHAHA you made my night! My boy got a tick a few months back and got a full shave.   Here's some photos - Why yes, I am a crazy cat lady!  Also, yeah the make up is cool too, I suppose :P"
AustralianMakeup,2tlpwv,courpsey,2,Sun Jan 25 10:22:14 2015 UTC,Haha I feel like not many people understand how crazy I am about my cats. He is beautiful!!!! I want to adopt so many more. ALL OF THE CATS!  I still lol when I look at those pictures.
AustralianMakeup,2tlpwv,badassbettie,2,Sun Jan 25 10:42:20 2015 UTC,Who can resist that fluffy belly? Beautiful cats. Is it weird that I want to give them cuddles? Just another cat lady here.
AustralianMakeup,2tlpwv,courpsey,2,Sun Jan 25 23:17:27 2015 UTC,The fluffy belly is the best! However I am partial to the shaved look. So sleek!
AustralianMakeup,2tlpwv,compactgirlfriend,1 point,Sun Jan 25 23:25:36 2015 UTC,Shaved look is also good. We give our cat a bit of a trim with hair clippers at the start of summer since he's long haired and never cleans himself. He likes the trimmers but he also tries to eat his shaved fur clumps.
AustralianMakeup,2tlpwv,compactgirlfriend,1 point,Sun Jan 25 23:36:09 2015 UTC,"That's it, I'm done. Xmas money spent and now back to my serious no buy -.- My phone camera has also been really shite of late! If anyone would like swatches please let me know!"
AustralianMakeup,2tlpwv,compactgirlfriend,1 point,Sun Jan 25 09:57:33 2015 UTC,How are the Zoeva brushes? I'm realllllly interested in buying some.
AustralianMakeup,2tlpwv,_yoshiii,1 point,Sun Jan 25 12:10:17 2015 UTC,"Better than I could have imagined. Worth every cent! But I would advise buying form Luxola over Beauty Bay. The brushes may be a couple of dollars more expensive (not much really) from Luxola, but they offer free shipping to Australia as well and it's by an express courier. I got my Luxola order in under a week vs. 3+ weeks for Beauty Bay and I know it takes even longer for BB orders for some people!"
AustralianMakeup,2tlpwv,_yoshiii,1 point,Sun Jan 25 12:13:36 2015 UTC,Just checked the website (Luxola) and 20% store wide for two hours during Australia day.  I may take the leap into Zoeva brushes c:
AustralianMakeup,2tlpwv,_yoshiii,2,Sun Jan 25 12:51:47 2015 UTC,Zoeva is a brand on their list of brands that promos never apply for unfortunately. You will only be able to pay full price for them! They're on beauty bay's no promo list too I believe!
AustralianMakeup,2tlpwv,panda_bear88,3,Sun Jan 25 12:54:24 2015 UTC,I've just gone through a roller coaster of emotions :(
AustralianMakeup,2tld33,score1fortheprincess,5,Sun Jan 25 06:23:40 2015 UTC,Sard wonder soap! From the laundry aisle in coles :] With your MAC voucher you can get something much cooler than brush cleaner.
AustralianMakeup,2tld33,girlyadvice,1 point,Sun Jan 25 11:10:56 2015 UTC,As a spot clean? Haha true
AustralianMakeup,2tld33,walkyouhome,2,Sun Jan 25 11:21:24 2015 UTC,"I really like the MAC brush cleaner, the one that comes in the big pink bottle! It does a pretty good job of getting everything off my brushes when I just tip a little onto a tissue and swirl my brush around in it. It's SO QUICK and they dry pretty much instantly afterwards.   I've been using it twice a week for almost a year and the bottle isn't even half empty so it's worth the investment."
AustralianMakeup,2tld33,panda_bear88,1 point,Sun Jan 25 06:35:02 2015 UTC,Yup I think I'll pick it up! Thanks :D
AustralianMakeup,2tld33,SparkleMUA,2,Sun Jan 25 06:52:16 2015 UTC,"I use it too, for spot cleaning and I have always been happy with it. Plus it counts for Back to Mac!"
AustralianMakeup,2tld33,compactgirlfriend,1 point,Sun Jan 25 07:21:06 2015 UTC,Sweeeeet.
AustralianMakeup,2tld33,compactgirlfriend,1 point,Sun Jan 25 07:32:43 2015 UTC,"I use baby shampoo or soap on my brushed every week to give them a really good clean or if i use them on clients, ill wash them that night.   If i want to clean them daily i use 70% alcohol as it will kill the germs then brush them on some tissue. It gives an ok clean but not as thorough  as shampoo.    And every month i will use a conditioner on my real hair brushes to make them softer.  Most 'brand' cleaners are just repackaged isopropyl alcohol and your just paying for the name."
AustralianMakeup,2tlgyq,ihaveacat-,8,Sun Jan 25 07:16:39 2015 UTC,"Just FYI for those who may purchase online. A lot of the swatch, colour descriptions and advertising images are not accurate at all. And if you want to return anything, they require you to pay for shipping back to their depot before they will refund you."
AustralianMakeup,2tlgyq,panda_bear88,3,Sun Jan 25 07:19:42 2015 UTC,Well I have mixed experiences with Klara.  Their kissproof lipstick is to an extent but I find that it can flake off and keep your lips a bit stained. It's also pretty drying. However I still like it.   I have one of their eye shadows it's like a silver glitter and I love it. Its like just a fine glitter if that makes sense. So I'm going to buy more of their eye shadows. I can do some swatches of the two lip colors I have and the eye-shadow a bit later if you guys would like. :)  With Klara I think it may come down to personal preference so it could be a hit or miss.    I have seen some of their products at Coles so perhaps head down there and see if some testers are around if you're thinking of buying?
AustralianMakeup,2tlgyq,tracesoflace,3,Sun Jan 25 07:28:54 2015 UTC,"Coles doesn't have testers, unfortunately. Especially considering the sky high price!"
AustralianMakeup,2tlgyq,cherry_cocopops,2,Sun Jan 25 12:36:56 2015 UTC,"I bought stuff in the boxing day sale & was preparing to be positive & excited. However the colours are NOT true to the website (like everyone says), my eyeshadow came broken & and they're at a very high price point. I am not going to repurchase. However the kiss proof lips is another level of lock - it technology"

AustralianMakeup,2tlf8d,sydneysomething,3,Sun Jan 25 06:51:43 2015 UTC,Does anyone else not get points added to their account? I've made three purchases from them all over 100 bucks and no points are registered on my account?
AustralianMakeup,2tlf8d,brucelovesyou,1 point,Sun Jan 25 07:07:12 2015 UTC,I think the changeover to the new website has been really glitchy in terms of the beauty loop stuff. My exact spend amount and level were only just updated about a week ago although I've had an account for over a year.  Maybe call them and ask them if you're not sure?
AustralianMakeup,2tlf8d,sydneysomething,1 point,Sun Jan 25 07:16:14 2015 UTC,You can email them to get the exact number :)
AustralianMakeup,2tlf8d,brucelovesyou,1 point,Sun Jan 25 09:42:59 2015 UTC,Does it matter if you've only ever purchased online and not in store? Would that make a difference?

AustralianMakeup,2tigsb,neodeone,1 point,Mon Jan 26 13:17:21 2015 UTC,Chanel loose powder is amazing! it is $72 but you are getting 30g of product which is huge! compared to Mac/bobbie brown setting powder $60 for 5-6g's its a huge difference.   Plus the quality is amazing and its so finely milled that you can really pack it on without looking caky!
AustralianMakeup,2thyy5,Tickle_Me_Tortoise,6,Sat Jan 24 08:44:40 2015 UTC,"And for those poor saps (like me) who has no Aldi in their state, you can get one very similar for the same price at office works :D I use one to store my palettes!"

AustralianMakeup,2ti0gp,prettyspryforacorpse,1 point,Sat Jan 24 20:54:17 2015 UTC,I'd also recommend looking at Revlon Baby Berry. It was my first plum and I find it's got beautiful undertones to it if you're looking for a plum with a bit more 'life' in it. Plus it goes wonderfully with Revlon's Colorburst lipgloss in Bordeaux if you want to layer something with a subtle but lovely shimmer.
AustralianMakeup,2ti0gp,eyelavaew,2,Sat Jan 24 22:34:33 2015 UTC,I like Rimmel 128 Starry Eyed. This swatch is pretty much spot on about the colour (at least on me).

I bought it in a clearance pack which I think had 2 for $5 or something insane like that and it makes my lashes look really good and lengthens nicely. I usually wear it with another volumising mascara though because it needs a bit of help in that department

AustralianMakeup,2teoj3,ezmereldah,2,Mon Jan 26 13:09:59 2015 UTC,"It's pretty good. It wouldn't be an every day mascara for me. It was actually a gift, not something I would buy myself and I probably wouldn't buy it again. I do have naturally long curled lashes though. My Mum sells them in her shop and she said they go like hot cakes!  Edit: HOLY EYELASHES BATMAN!! I got curious after your comment on the price, I can't believe it's $70! That is definitely not something I would repurchase. In saying that though, if eyelash extensions is something you would do then it is probably worth it. This would work out cheaper and be much better for your lashes :)"

I have fair eyelashes too and wanted something milder but every darn ""brown"" mascara I bought was much more of a ultra-dark-brown than anything else.    In the end, the only mascara i've settled on is actually a Japanese brand's - Majolica Majorca Lash King which is a shame because it's kinda a tough one to get.  I was able to find it in a Japanese style cosmetics shop here (but it was expensive) but it can also be found on eBay too.    Liole (a Korean brand) also makes a beautifully coloured brown mascara but it's a real asshole to remove and doesn't feel great at all for extended wear."

AustralianMakeup,2td6cu,amyeh,2,Fri Jan 23 06:21:30 2015 UTC,I find that Tokyo and Rio D have the worst formulas of the bunch in terms of dryness. My favourites are the LE Grandmaster Pash and the Miami shade

AustralianMakeup,2t9f4g,Charlotto,4,Thu Jan 22 07:37:56 2015 UTC,I've never been able to work out this brand. Its always there but I never hear anything about it. I love the Facefinity powder foundation it is seriously one of my favourite powders ever. I use it as a setting powder and it makes my make up stay all  day and stops me getting too oily. I actually have it in a few different colours and reach for it a lot. The only thing that bugs me is the price! I could probably get a high end powder for not much more...
AustralianMakeup,2t9f4g,trignometry,3,Thu Jan 22 08:55:46 2015 UTC,I personally love their Fantasy Fire mini nail polish. It takes a bit to build it up (like 4 thin-ish coats for me) but it also works great over other polishes.
AustralianMakeup,2t9f4g,panda_bear88,2,Fri Jan 23 02:47:47 2015 UTC,I tried Max Factor's Million Lashes mascara as a possibility for my wedding make up. I already had a mascara I loved but it wasn't waterproof and I'm a big cry-baby so I knew I needed a different product for my wedding day. Happily I trialled the Million Lashes waterproof BEFORE the actual day because I hated it. I really don't like overly-wet mascara formulations and this just slopped on. I don't recommend it unless you are willing to carefully comb it through with an eyelash comb to separate your lashes again once this product has combined them.

AustralianMakeup,2t8zqu,jamballdonut,1 point,Thu Jan 22 07:06:36 2015 UTC,"I've only ever tried on both the Velourlips, and I only tried on the Savvy one today (I always test the colours first, then realise they're way too much effort to ever actually wear out because my lip shape is annoying) but it felt pretty good!  The actual product is a lot thicker than Velvetines (if you have any of those to compare, if not they are literally liquid) but this one seemed about the same thickness as my Velourlips (which remind me more of a cream than a ""liquid""), but it applied well and 2 coats (while the first was still wet, does that count as a second coat?) got the colour to a good pigment.  It applied fairly easily (since it's thicker than my Velvetine, it stayed where I put it and didn't run down like that one sometimes does) and didn't seem too drying (although I can imagine it getting quite drying after a while).  Overall, it seemed pretty good! & I know they dry super matte, since I also have the pink Savvy one (which I've also only ever tried on.  But, I swatched it on my hand once to compare to my Pink Velvet, and luckily they're different enough for me to justify owning both!)  Hopefully this wasn't too confusing for you! I know I get sidetracked a lot :P"

Way less of a chance to mess it up, imo!"

At that point, it was already passed the 20 days, which I explained in my email. They just gave me a random date to contact them if my package hadn't arrived.   So I waited, and then two days after that date, my package finally came (and for some reason, the ends of the box were wide open). Their website said there were postage delays in Australia, so I'm guessing that might be the reason why it took so long.   It's weird, because I made three orders during Christmas (those damn sales kept tempting me and I kept coming back for more. Ugh) and the other two had no problems getting to Sydney.

They're about $5  Blue - Sportsgirl has their blue lippies on sale atm. I think around $2-3?  Some eyeshadows are lip safe but unless you know for certain I wouldn't risk it.   Other options are DIY such as taking a little bit of red lipstick, melting it down and mixing in some blue food dye to give purple (WILL STAIN!) or brushing on some silver edible glitter over an existing lipstick.

AustralianMakeup,2t5ldy,alyss0r,14,Wed Jan 21 09:12:01 2015 UTC,The NARS pump is $4 but honestly for the price of the foundation would it kill these companies to throw in a measly pump that probably costs them 5c to produce?
AustralianMakeup,2t5ldy,backwards01,10,Wed Jan 21 09:25:11 2015 UTC,apparently the nars cap splits into two pieces like Chanel nail polishes. it has a smaller cap underneath which you can remove to make the pump fit with the big cap on.

AustralianMakeup,2t4s6q,BlissAbyss,0,Wed Jan 21 11:16:39 2015 UTC,I use this foundation too and I love it. Which is devastating because Clinique tests on animals and I'm trying to go cruelty free. What do I do now???
AustralianMakeup,2t4s6q,BlissAbyss,5,Wed Jan 21 13:09:40 2015 UTC,"I have a fairly similar complexion to you actually. I went to Sephora a little bit after it opened in Sydney and they couldn't find a match a match in any other brand but Colour FX. Which I don't know how to get your hands on any other way but the store at the moment (sorry).   For drugstore, the ones that I have found that go pale enough are Revlon and sometimes (I stress sometimes) L'oreal. Don't bother with the Nude By Nature one in Fair, even if it does match in colour it does nothing, particularly if you have rosacea.   I recently got a sample of the Bare Minerals BareSkin foundation from Mecca in the lightest shade which was a good match. It does have to be applied with a stippling brush in circular motions to be blended in properly though. I also have a sample of the NARS Sheer Glow Mont Blanc which weirdly enough matches okay (I have only really tried it once lightly) but I would definitely recommend trialling this one first just in case. Don't touch anything by Smashbox, they do not go near light enough. I don't have much to say about other brands as I am still trying foundations out.  I am currently using the Benefit Bigger than BB foundation thing in the fair shade, which is fairly good (best applied with hands). It does have a high SPF in it though so it is only for day wear (does not pass a flash photography test) and it is really expensive in Australia. If you order over $125 on the Benefit website you do get free international shipping though. Sometimes they take it down to $100 if you keep an eye out. It makes the products so much cheaper as well.   Also if you want more info there is always /r/PaleMUA"
AustralianMakeup,2t4s6q,One_of_a_Kind,3,Wed Jan 21 10:42:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the recommendations, I'm hoping I can get some samples sent from MECCA. Sadly I can't get Benefit samples, it's not stocked in Hobart Myer, but it's good to know about free international shipping though.  I was in Sydney over Christmas... kicking myself that I couldn't go makeup shopping while I was there!  I'm subbed to /r/palemua (and lots of the other makeup subs) which has been a great resource. I've looked at so many swatch photos everything is starring the blur together :)"
AustralianMakeup,2t4s6q,BlissAbyss,1 point,Wed Jan 21 11:45:15 2015 UTC,It's all good. It gets really frustrating sometimes. Bare Minerals is a British brand so they tend to go lighter than most brands that I have found.  Also particularly for redness it might be worth investing in a green concealer or primer to put underneath a foundation. It generally works for me. You can get a super cheap one from Maybelline as well.
AustralianMakeup,2t4s6q,One_of_a_Kind,2,Wed Jan 21 22:29:51 2015 UTC,"Did you mean Cover FX? They're also available from PMStudio in Waterloo, Sydney. I think they send out samples if you phone them, but not from their online store."

AustralianMakeup,2t4s6q,One_of_a_Kind,3,Thu Jan 22 08:36:13 2015 UTC,"In Priceline, I've found Bourjois do fairly pale foundations. The sample bottles are nearly always missing when I go in, but look out for their palest shades. I have no idea if you're warm (yellow) or cool (pink) but hopefully some match.  Lightest shades:   Healthy mix (serum and gel) - 51 light vanilla Happy light - 51 vanilla rose 1 2 3 Perfect - light vanilla   You say you can try MAC. If their face and body foundation doesn't irritate and covers the redness enough, they have a white foundation. It is only available in the $60 120mL bottle, and will not work with any other foundation (I've tried).  There is also the option of matching the tone, and buying a different white foundation - I know Illamasqua do a white one, and maybe a couple of others.  Edit: I was in MECCA today, and I mentioned to them that I don't exactly live close. They will take phone orders. I'd say it is worth phoning them and seeing if they can send out samples, as they are not stingy."
AustralianMakeup,2t4s6q,daphnesucks,2,Wed Jan 21 10:01:11 2015 UTC,"My local Priceline only has the middle three shades, the SA said the darkest and lightest ones are only available online. I might check out the other Hobart stores though, just in case!  With MAC, I asked the girl if there was anything lighter and she said no, but she might have thought I meant just the mineralised one, I'll go back in and specifically ask for face and body. (It was my first cosmetics counter visit, got totally overwhelmed!)  I have seen Illamasqua recommended a lot, but unfortunately it's not in Myer down here.  That's a good suggestion about calling MECCA, I will definitely try that tomorrow! Thanks!"
AustralianMakeup,2t4s6q,urbqndecqy,2,Wed Jan 21 11:05:43 2015 UTC,The middle shades are the only ones available in aus. I got 51 on asos for a lot cheaper than in Priceline (also if you have uni days or know someone in uni you can get an extra discount)
AustralianMakeup,2t4s6q,urbqndecqy,1 point,Wed Jan 21 12:49:56 2015 UTC,"I own face and body in C1 and white, and studio fix in NC15. The lightest face and body is darker than studio fix.  For Illamasqua, I'd try to see if other people get it to work mixing their other foundations down. And if it looks plausible buy it online (if you feel like spending the $50 or $60 that that bottle of skin base costs, that is). I cannot remember if it's one of the brands that Myer / David Jones sells online though.  Good luck with MECCA."
AustralianMakeup,2t4s6q,Flippantry,2,Wed Jan 21 11:20:11 2015 UTC,IIRC Rimmel Match Perfection is really really pale (NC/NW10 turns out to be the 2/3rd lightest shade?) so that might be a good option? You should have testers and you can pump some into a little container?
AustralianMakeup,2t4s6q,coinlocker,1 point,Wed Jan 21 04:59:11 2015 UTC,"I remember looking at a few Rimmel foundations but not Match Perfection, I'll have a look for that one when I go shopping tomorrow. Thanks for the suggestion!"
AustralianMakeup,2t4s6q,One_of_a_Kind,2,Wed Jan 21 11:09:44 2015 UTC,"Have you perhaps tried mixing 2 different foundation tones together? I always find that if my foundation is too light i will get a pump of a darker foundation, or if it's a shade darker than my skin colour then i'll get a pump or whatever is needed to get the right colour. Also you could ask them to get a more yellow base/toned foundation to mix you to?"
AustralianMakeup,2t4s6q,BBQsauceBel,1 point,Wed Jan 21 09:53:30 2015 UTC,"I haven't actually come across a foundation that's too light, but someone else suggested MAC face and body because it comes in white, so I'm going to try that next."
AustralianMakeup,2t55xd,ihaveacat-,3,Wed Jan 21 05:46:45 2015 UTC,"their shipping is notoriously slow but they often pack the products really well, I've ordered from them a lot and never received a broken item :)"
AustralianMakeup,2t55xd,neodeone,1 point,Wed Jan 21 05:56:54 2015 UTC,"To counter that, mine were packaged badly. Just two small items loose in a flat box with no padding whatsoever."
AustralianMakeup,2t55xd,alyss0r,1 point,Wed Jan 21 09:08:11 2015 UTC,that's terrible! what kind of products were they? if they weren't powder or particularly breakable I wouldn't have minded too much but if you're paying for shipping you should expect it to be packed decently.
AustralianMakeup,2t55xd,neodeone,2,Wed Jan 21 11:09:19 2015 UTC,"I got DipBrow (which was fine obviously) and a Stila baked cheek duo. The cheek duo didn't break but it sort of detached from the base, so I can't travel with it (it probably WILL break then) or tip it upside down or anything. Mild inconvenience, but I'm pretty sure it was caused by shoddy packaging.   I did buy during the Black Friday sales so the large volume of orders may have affected the packing quality. :)"
AustralianMakeup,2t55xd,alyss0r,1 point,Wed Jan 21 11:27:22 2015 UTC,I ordered during that sale too but I only ordered dip brow and it came with a metric fucktonne of bubble wrap so maybe it was a mistake but beauty bay can be really hit and miss. dip brow would have survived the journey easily but that stila item should have been wrapped up!
AustralianMakeup,2t55xd,neodeone,1 point,Wed Jan 21 11:37:37 2015 UTC,Now I feel cheated :( I had a second order I put through on behalf of my SO as a Christmas present for me and I'm pretty sure that one didn't have bubble wrap either.
AustralianMakeup,2t55xd,alyss0r,3,Wed Jan 21 12:29:38 2015 UTC,It's definitely quite slow. I ordered on 29/11 (that's the receipt number anyways). Arrived on 16/12. I got mine quicker than others and please note I got it during their sale :) I made a haul post when I received it so you can check it out here if you wanna get an idea of the packaging.
AustralianMakeup,2t55xd,bitch_is_cray_cray,3,Wed Jan 21 11:02:18 2015 UTC,"Last month I made two orders, one a day after the first one (forgot to buy dipbrow brushes) and they sent out the first one on 10/12. I received it on the second order on 13/01 and the first one on 16/01. I started freaking out and started emailing them to start a lost order complaint and it took them around 3-5 days to reply to each email. While I was freaking out I bought the same things on net-a-porter on 12/01 and they arrived on the day between the BeautyBay orders (express 2 day shipping woo). Also, one of my orders came squashed and bent into my letter box. The product was ok, though. Nonetheless, I was hella mad.  Understandably, it was during the Christmas period... but I made orders from American and Chinese stores after I made my BeautyBay orders and they arrived well before the BeautyBay orders... What I can just say is don't believe in their 7-10 day policy, and if you're ordering ABH, order it off net-a-porter; prices are the same, $10 express shipping and the net-a-porter signature black packaging is really pretty"
AustralianMakeup,2t55xd,eyeslipshoes,2,Wed Jan 21 12:54:51 2015 UTC,"The wait time was really long for me, about five weeks for the tiniest package!"
AustralianMakeup,2t55xd,Toma_the_Wondercat,2,Wed Jan 21 07:54:09 2015 UTC,"My first order from them took about 3 weeks, still waiting on an order I placed on Boxing Day. Their postage is so slow it's almost backwards, but then again I believe it is all shipped from the UK."
AustralianMakeup,2t55xd,pootlepower,2,Wed Jan 21 10:15:06 2015 UTC,I made 2 orders on the 23rd and 27th of December and have not received them yet. I contacted them but they wouldn't help me until 21 business days. Other than that I do think they are way cheaper and if you're willing to wait I'd buy from them!
AustralianMakeup,2t55xd,Mydoglovesreddit,2,Wed Jan 21 21:46:27 2015 UTC,I've ordered from them and it took over 3 weeks to get to me and my chocolate bar pallette had been touched - there were finger marks in there =( I know of another girl who had the same issue. BB wont take it back and said there was nothing wrong with it.... be careful is my advice to you. Their customer service is terrible - except for twitter.  I wouldn't order from them again =( There are too many other sites that you can use - like myqty that are in Brisbane - that sell the same items.
AustralianMakeup,2t55xd,despseeksaudrey,1 point,Thu Jan 22 00:02:12 2015 UTC,I received an order today from them actually! I ordered on the 3rd of Jan and it was shipped on the 8th or 9th our time so I wouldn't worry! I've had orders from BB take 4 weeks before. If it hits week 4-5 I would start chasing them up! :)  Products were definitely packed well as /u/neodeone said and everything arrived intact! I spent enough to qualify for tracked shipping for free.
AustralianMakeup,2t55xd,Jessijames,1 point,Wed Jan 21 07:18:51 2015 UTC,"Their shipping is DEFINITELY slow.  My mum ordered me the Naked 2 for my birthday almost 4 years ago, and she ordered it 2 weeks beforehand (Since the shipping says 7-10 days) and on my birthday she had nothing to give me, haha.  It arrived about a week later.  I thought maybe they'd gotten better, and ordered the Chocolate Bar palette last July, and it took about 2.5-3 weeks to come too.  But, both times the packaging was really good, and my products were super safe.  I'm planning on placing an order tonight, so hopefully it's here before March, haha!"

AustralianMakeup,2t55xd,bellardonna,1 point,Thu Jan 22 03:45:24 2015 UTC,Wow interesting mixed reviews... I should've asked before I place my order. I'm waiting for my stila foundation....maybe next time I'll just buy it from mecca...
AustralianMakeup,2t1wt5,Cateroseg,5,Tue Jan 20 14:33:36 2015 UTC,Of course they do. Right after I order one of their palettes. Pfffffbt.
AustralianMakeup,2t1wt5,redtonks,3,Tue Jan 20 20:53:27 2015 UTC,"same. I just went and bought the bases palette to try. bah!  I will show them, I will buy the nudes and gems ones now."
AustralianMakeup,2t1wt5,DominionGalactica,3,Tue Jan 20 23:35:58 2015 UTC,"LOL. If it makes you feel better, the nudes one is pretty good. I'm using it now. Bit of fallout but nice color!"
AustralianMakeup,2t1wt5,redtonks,2,Wed Jan 21 01:14:02 2015 UTC,"meh, they're generally 70-80% sold out of them every time I go in store.. chances are they may not have had it in stock anyway!"
AustralianMakeup,2t1wt5,Lunawinter,2,Wed Jan 21 03:29:34 2015 UTC,I've never tried their products- what is good to look out for?
AustralianMakeup,2t1wt5,backwards01,1 point,Tue Jan 20 21:38:57 2015 UTC,"I have a couple of the eyeshadow palettes and a few nail polishes.  The Naturals palette is very useful, has both warm and cool toned shades of brown."
AustralianMakeup,2t1wt5,jodes,1 point,Wed Jan 21 00:20:07 2015 UTC,"Their lipsticks are apparently really good but I've never tried them. They do have palettes like Rich Gems, Nudes and Bases that are also very good for the price. I have the Rich Gems palette and I love it."
AustralianMakeup,2t1wt5,courpsey,1 point,Wed Jan 21 00:20:27 2015 UTC,"I've currently got the ""Bases"" palette, it's nice enough (for the price bracket) that I'm planning to buy another one. I've not tried anything else of theirs though."
AustralianMakeup,2t1wt5,DominionGalactica,1 point,Wed Jan 21 01:31:34 2015 UTC,I love their lipsticks. I have bring it on and social butterfly. Their glamorous eyeshadow palettes are great for beginners too. Especially the Nudes. It is a great dupe for UD Naked1 so there will be plenty of tutorials you could follow online with the Chi Chi palette.
AustralianMakeup,2t1wt5,panda_bear88,2,Wed Jan 21 02:04:52 2015 UTC,The sale only applies to eyes and lips
AustralianMakeup,2t1wt5,gemawo,2,Wed Jan 21 14:30:01 2015 UTC,"Not of the palettes are on sale unfortunately. Went in today and got the naturals palette, got home and looked at the receipt and it was $22.95. My friend got a palette in nudes and that was on sale though ($16.05). Will be heading back tomorrow to see if they can fix it since the catalogue says 30% off all Chi Chi eyes and lips.  Edit: Seems to be a mistake in their system, all of their glamorous eyeshadow palettes are supposed to be $16.05. Customer service says they'll be fixing it."

AustralianMakeup,2t1wt5,reddit-g,1 point,Tue Jan 20 23:10:33 2015 UTC,I got my chandelier glosses from Myer. They currently have 25% off Chi Chi.

AustralianMakeup,2t1wt5,sarkata,1 point,Wed Jan 21 05:46:01 2015 UTC,Some stock at my local was red stickered and then had the additional 30% off - I got a lipstick (Glamourama) for $6
AustralianMakeup,2t1wt5,cherry_cocopops,1 point,Wed Jan 21 22:15:51 2015 UTC,"Let's be honest, Target rarely does an admirable job of stocking Chichi with the latest releases(or stocking items that have run out) or keeping their stands clean or tidy. As much as I love a sale it's easy to get frustrated with Target & Chichi"
AustralianMakeup,2t1wt5,gospursgo_,0,Sun Jan 25 01:13:48 2015 UTC,"man, my local target is the worst. they never got any of the new palettes in when i was there last week, no sponges, nothing :/"
AustralianMakeup,2t1wt5,PoleL0ver,0,Wed Jan 21 00:53:09 2015 UTC,"So disappointed in my local target! In total they had about 10 of the viva la diva lipsticks and only had half the eyeshadow palettes :( I don't understand why they don't restock before a sale, still got a couple of things to try though :)"

I am still waiting for the rest of my replacements as promised two weeks later and they are not responding to emails."
AustralianMakeup,2t1c7m,jessislol,0,Tue Jan 20 12:43:23 2015 UTC,Definitely give them a call! It seems as though they're very generous with replacements for orders that have been screwed up!

I'm a Lush newbie but so far am pretty impressed with the products and the service."
AustralianMakeup,2t1c7m,Tazerin,2,Tue Jan 20 11:52:59 2015 UTC,"Awesome, Mecca are the same regarding feedback. They reward the customer who gives good feedback and more importantly the staff member gets recognised."
AustralianMakeup,2t1c7m,StormThestral,1 point,Wed Jan 21 00:42:54 2015 UTC,I've always thought Lush was great but heaps of people I know hate the company and say it's really dodgy. Is there some backstory I'm missing?
AustralianMakeup,2t1c7m,StrangeFarulf,2,Tue Jan 20 12:20:16 2015 UTC,"Their post-purchase customer service is great. There is some controversy over some of their face products due to them containing irritating ingredients like essential oils and rough salt/sugar. Also, some of their sales tactics in stores can be pushy. I just order online and avoid buying face products from Lush, and I'm happy as a clam with them!"
AustralianMakeup,2t1c7m,Tazerin,2,Tue Jan 20 22:04:40 2015 UTC,I love lush products but their sales people in-store are so intense and in your face that I'm actually scared to go in there.

AustralianMakeup,2t1bbk,nailgirlblog,2,Tue Jan 20 11:00:07 2015 UTC,I only ever bought during their 40% sales and the shipping was made up for in price. It takes a while to get processed during the sales (compared to normal according to my friend) but honestly I don't mind for such cheap costs

Also, it is impossible that you will get Cashmere in Australia. LC pulled out of all Australian stores & stockists as that shade was being released, they allowed the main wholesale store to retain a small number of the stock of Cashmere that they had already ordered and when they received it in Dec it sold out within hours. Sorry, but unless you buy from LC direct you are out of luck trying to get your hands on Cashmere which sucks.   I made sure I bought a tube on Friday when I ordered! :)"

AustralianMakeup,2st44j,jenjenl,2,Sun Jan 18 07:03:01 2015 UTC,I heard those rumours too. I think maybe they just..ran out of stock and didn't restock for like.. 6 months? Maybe they didn't realise how much people wanted it.
AustralianMakeup,2st44j,panda_bear88,2,Sun Jan 18 07:21:32 2015 UTC,That sounds entirely possible! Well at least I can get my hands on it now without trawling /r/MUE haha

Less drying for me than the velvetines. They do have a sweet smell to them, kinda like vanilla, but nothing I can't handle. When you swatch you will know what I mean!"

AustralianMakeup,2sq52q,bam-bino-69,12,Sat Jan 17 11:20:33 2015 UTC,"For best results when blending - blend wet products over wet products and dry products over dry. So if you put on liquid foundation, apply your cream blush before powdering. If you want to apply a powder blush, powder your face first and then apply the powder blush. This rule can be applied to pretty much everything that you want to blend on your face."

I usually don't bother with eyeliner at all, because I would always put it either too low (causing it to run horribly) or too high (causing it to just end up messy and not at all how I was intending).   ...Except, I worked it out myself last night. Using the same product as you, too! I wish someone had shown me this more clearly sooner.  Is there any specific product you can recommend to stop eyeliner and mascara from running?

AustralianMakeup,2sq52q,MaxisDiedForYourSims,1 point,Sun Jan 18 08:25:04 2015 UTC,I always do my eyes first and I find it so strange that all the youtube people do a full heavy face before they do a dark smokey eye or whatever. Then they have there methods of cleaning the fallout. Juts do eyes first then that problem is solved! seems so simple.

AustralianMakeup,2sq52q,gospursgo_,3,Sun Jan 18 06:19:51 2015 UTC,"When using a setting spray or something like fix+ for a dewy effect and want precise application, spray onto a brush and then gently dab on face- like cheeks for example  When putting liner in water line, use a brush like the real techniques contour brush or the brush you set your concealer with, to pull the eye down a bit instead of your finger   If going with a bold lip, put the lipstick on before blush to judge how much you are about to venture into clown territory :  If you have dryer flaky skin, exfoliation will make such a huge difference in your foundation application. I recommend the Olay pro x brush thingy, it's cheap and so good!  Good lighting when applying your make up, I have poor lighting in my bedroom and will think everything looks flawless, but as soon as I get in the car and look in my mirror it becomes very 'fix it Jesus'   and remember that winged/top liner doesn't look good on everyone and very dependant on your eyes shape, know what works for you!    :( (it took a long time to come out of denial)"

AustralianMakeup,2sphi8,Kateus3000,2,Sun Jan 18 02:54:08 2015 UTC,I like buying Aussie brands but everything I love tends to be Asian or European >.>  i will make an effort though.   If any girls have good suggestions for Aussie stuff to buy I'd be grateful. I can't wear drugstore foundation as it's never the right colour but willing to try anything else.
AustralianMakeup,2sphi8,SparkleMUA,3,Sun Jan 18 06:11:30 2015 UTC,"I have quite a few favourites from Aussie brands.  Chi Chi eyeshadows are brilliant (both the palettes & the single baked eyeshadows), as well as their lipsticks.  Australis lipsticks, Velourlips, and contour kit are all pretty great.  (Their Fresh & Flawless powder is also pretty good, but only comes in 3 colours and the ""light"" shade is still too dark/yellow for me, sigh.)  BOE Beauty is a great $2 brand from Big-W & I really like their powders (I find their face powder is pretty decent for the price & keeps me matte for ages, although the shade range is a little weird.  Their blushes are also pretty decent, although not the most pigmented and the colour range is like a mauve and then a slightly darker mauve, so not much selection.  But, their bronzer is probably my favourite & I use it for my daily contour, since it's not super pigmented, it means it's easy to build up without being too extreme.) I also enjoy their jumbo lip pencils too.  Edit: Forgot about Face of Australia & Savvy!  Face of Australia does really good lipsticks (The shade ""Peaches & Cream"" is my perfect MLBB shade & I just love how creamy it is), I also enjoy their blushes & have heard good things about their translucent powder.  (Although, I have their tinted moisturiser & wouldn't recommend that, which is a shame).  I've also heard really good things about their brow kit.  Savvy is one of my favourite brands, and I loooooooove their blushes.  I have 3 now, and they are my holy grail go-to blush & only $4.99!! The lasting power is pretty decent considering, but holy gosh they're so pigmented & you definitely need to use a light-hand or else you'll have clown cheeks.  I also like their face powder to use as a natural contour (depending on my mood, I'll either use this or the BOE Beauty bronzer).  I have a few of their lipsticks too & they're not too bad.  Also, their matte lip creams are pretty good (I've only ever worn it long enough to see what the colour looks like on my lips, so can't comment on wear-time or anything!)"

Her makeup tutorials aren't that great and are more catered towards younger audiences. xosharonnoelle TheBeautifoolBlog Fables in Fashion    I also found some others by searching an Aussie product, such as the Australis Velourlips on youtube.

As for youtubers, for more creative stuff I like Biohazardous beauty, Emma Pickles, Klaire DeLys and Nikkitutorials. They seem to do a good mixture of wearable, out-there and even spfx make up looks."
AustralianMakeup,2sor9d,sydneysomething,1 point,Sat Jan 17 02:15:44 2015 UTC,Thanks for the recommendations! I'll definitely put them on my list
AustralianMakeup,2sor9d,missb00,4,Sun Jan 18 05:42:28 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly not sure about a book, but as far as makeup goes I'd stay clear of those ""all in one"" kits some places like Kmart and Big W have at times. I've seen people looking at them and I'd be really wary of the ingredients and quality.  Since you mentioned creative makeup, your niece sounds like a perfect candidate for the Urban Decay Electric Palette! A cheaper and more easily-accessible product would be the Chi Chi OMFG palette which I think she'd have lots of fun with! Chi Chi do a whole range of similar palettes as well, which are good quality and reasonably priced.  As for YouTube tutorials, I absolutely love Vintageortacky. In between reviews and neutral tutorials, she has some really creative and fun looks, and does an excellent job at explaining things.  Hope this helps!"
AustralianMakeup,2sor9d,missb00,1 point,Sat Jan 17 00:48:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was definitely thinking of something along the lines of the OMFG palette. My only reservation is that I don't know if she actually has any experience with face make up. Is it too much to jump straight into the crazy colourful stuff?  Thanks for the tutorials.

AustralianMakeup,2sor9d,Stelare,1 point,Sun Jan 18 05:41:57 2015 UTC,"Well from what you described she seems like a pretty creative person, and would absolutely adore a colourful palette over a more neutral one.

You feel super weird talking to yourself/a camera.  But, I've always found it pretty easy, and people always comment on how comfortable I look in front of the camera, especially considering how new I am to it.  My biggest thing is editing, and I'll sometimes have to take a break because my brain goes crazy over seeing myself (I have an anxiety disorder, and suffer from depersonalisation, so that's probably just something I have to go through & not everyone, haha!) so that's always fun.  But, altogether, I've found it really fun so far & have ""met"" some really cool people & formed little friendships with them.  I always love watching smaller Aussies, so it's really nice to contribute to that & yeah! You should definitely do it if you want to, but remember to do it for fun not to gain anything out of it.  Gaining subscribers can be difficult, and having the motive to do it as a job is hard & can take years to happen.  Just make sure you start with no expectations & you'll be right! :)"

I paid under $150 AUD for that set through Beauty Bay but like I said it's been almost week 3 and it's only just hit Aus shores. The difference is barely $20 plus an extra few bucks here and there I saved on the individual brushes too so I can handle the wait to save some coin

AustralianMakeup,2shxht,twistedinnocence,12,Thu Jan 15 09:47:13 2015 UTC,I feel like Sephora cannot possibly be that stupid. Maybe the staff decided to do it on their own? Like got together and wanted to support the image of their workplace.
AustralianMakeup,2shxht,reddit-g,5,Thu Jan 15 09:02:11 2015 UTC,That could be possible. I also considered the idea that they may have received some form of bonus in samples or something if they posted. To me it seems unusual that all of the reviews happened in a single 24 hour period.
AustralianMakeup,2shxht,_HappyG_,3,Thu Jan 15 09:04:49 2015 UTC,"Is possible for sure, I guess I just hope that the people in charge of the store wouldn't bribe/persuade/direct their staff to post fake reviews from their personal Facebook accounts!

These would be 19-23 year old girls who feel deeply attached to working for the Sephora brand and probably feel hard done by because of the reviews (that largely relate to issues outside of their control anyway). So I bet they came up with this and are going to face management's wrath tomorrow."

AustralianMakeup,2shuqg,ceaselessindecision,4,Thu Jan 15 07:35:51 2015 UTC,"Hi Guys, this is my first time doing a post like this, so CCW! I used my iPhone and I tried to get the best pictures possible. Somehow some blurry pictures got in there, if someone knows how to delete images from an album, that'd be great :)  I found this at Priceline in Margaret Street, Sydney today. I am pale skinned (no tan, just burn) so I do a very light contour and use more highlight than anything, so I was excited to see this.   The packaging is pretty nice, normal thin cardboard, shiny. The back gives a link to a website or mentions the instructions are inside. I was extremely relieved to see bubble wrap inside, but it must have been bumped once as there is some fallout under the plastic when I opened it. Points for that, especially because the Australis wall was a complete train wreck!  The palette itself is very nice - matte, not slippery - a must for me, I always seem to drop my eyeshadow palettes...The back comes with step by step instructions on how to contour and highlight. I've included pictures up close so you can see too. I was wishing it came with a mirror though, because it's a good sized backing.  I couldn't get a good picture of the contours close up but they are true to life in the picture showing all six. (It seems I uploaded two. I meant the one that is closer to the end - oops). The powder is very creamy and pigmented. I would say the lightest shade of the highlight wouldn't do very much for me, but the other two are great. I like the third one the best, as it's pink based and has a subtle shimmer.  I was a little scared of the darkness of the contour, but if I'm not heavy handed, I'm sure I'll use all three.  All in all I think this is a great palette, especially for a newbie. and it only cost me $16.50!  What'd you think?"

AustralianMakeup,2sho97,sarkata,1 point,Thu Jan 15 11:04:23 2015 UTC,Miami is my favourite!!! First one of them that I got and it had me sold from the second I first applied it!
AustralianMakeup,2sho97,cherry_cocopops,1 point,Thu Jan 15 23:07:17 2015 UTC,"I'm the same. I put it on and always end up taking it off before I leave the house (and I wear some very bold lip colours at times). I have a fluro orange from stargazer that's even brighter and I do wear that but I just can't pull off rio-d. If you like the brightness of rio-d, Miami is really bright on me but more of a wAtermelony colour. It would be nice if the new shades were a combo of vampy colours and pastels!"

AustralianMakeup,2sho97,Jessijames,2,Thu Jan 15 07:13:56 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's a creamy/glossy version of velour lips? Methinks when they say ""range"" it's not adding colours to an existing range."
AustralianMakeup,2sh6y9,alfie_,2,Thu Jan 15 03:18:03 2015 UTC,"So, I work at Lush and I have found people either love it or hate it. I am a bit meh about it. The wand is short so it is a bit awkward to apply and the formulation is quite wet and some people loathe that. I have a lot of problems with finding mascara that doesn't irritate my eyes and this doesn't at all which is a huge plus for me.   As for other makeup, I absolutely love the lip colours and eye liners. They are highly pigmented and have great staying power. The store I work at had a bowl of 50% off makeup for the boxing day sale and we still have a few left so other stores might too, they are a bargain. And if you are looking for a pink tinted setting powder Emotional Brilliance Face Powder is really good.   While it's not a make up product, the Enchanted Eye Cream is my HG under eye primer. It stops concealer from slipping (ugh humidity!) and my eyes feel so much more awake."
AustralianMakeup,2sh6y9,Iucrezia,1 point,Thu Jan 15 07:42:55 2015 UTC,I would love some of the lip colours and eyeliners but they're so $$$!

The babyface isn't anything special as far as primers go, if you're looking for a very siliconey primer to blur pores may i suggest the Garnier 5 second blur one, it makes my skin look amazing without foundation and it's very affordable"

AustralianMakeup,2sd23p,pinkertongeranium,2,Thu Jan 15 00:45:26 2015 UTC,"Haha, not sure what she thought the ingredients were! You can always check the ingredients list yourself to see, i've found its the most reliable means to know what i'm buying -.-"

AustralianMakeup,2sd23p,blackcats666,1 point,Thu Jan 15 11:43:47 2015 UTC,":/ that sucks. I don't know who keeps messing up and giving everyone wrong info! Best way to be sure bout whether something is silicone or water based is to read the ingredients, sheer glow has silicones first up on the list (after water which is necessary for a liquid texture) which means silicones comprise the majority of the ingredients."

AustralianMakeup,2sd23p,phattoes,1 point,Thu Jan 15 12:28:41 2015 UTC,"hmm. interesting. i definitely wouldn't call it a water-based foundation though. maybe try applying it over a silicone primer on one hand and a water primer on the other hand and see which one lasts the longest before buying a new primer? also maybe see how much wear you can get out of it without a primer? i often don't use one. also people's skins are different, does it slip off your face cos of the summer heat or oily skin? i have oily skin but i tried sheer glow with a water primer and couldn't use it cos it started pilling around my jawline :/"

The other two lipsticks I got from Kmart for $7 each."
AustralianMakeup,2sdali,sydneysomething,2,Wed Jan 14 04:54:07 2015 UTC,"I have sensitive eyes and I've definitely noticed stinging and watering after some formulas. There are mascaras that are designed for sensitive eyes, Physician's Formula is well known for targeting that market for example, however the best thing to do is to identify your own personal sensitivities.  Have a look at the ingredients, and also consider if it could be caused by flakey mascara; I was recently trying a new formula and couldn't figure out why it was stinging so much after drying (usually strong smelling or irritating mascaras will sting as soon as they get near my eye) and it was the flakes falling into my eye and getting trapped under my lid where they were causing irritation.   P.S. I love the look, the pop of colour really works without the eyebrows there and lifts the eye."
AustralianMakeup,2sdali,_HappyG_,2,Wed Jan 14 05:26:25 2015 UTC,"I'll definitely look up the ingredients and have a read about them.   Hmm, flakiness could be an issue. I've noticed today after wearing the mascara yesterday my eye is very sore in one particular spot, as though my cornea has been scratched or something. Maybe a flake is to blame.   I think I had a look at some of their stuff on Iherb once. Unfortunately my priceline doesn't seem to carry any of the physicians formula stuff. I'll have to look around other places for it.   And thank you! Originally it was just going to be a dot on the inner corner;trying out some of my new sleek eyeshadows, y'see. Anyway I ended up getting way too much on the brush and the rest is history haha."
AustralianMakeup,2sdali,FeistyRose,2,Wed Jan 14 07:11:11 2015 UTC,"With my allergies, I've never had an issue with Rimmel or Essence mascaras.  They don't sting my eyes, or make them swell up.  But there was much trial and error!  I also use a waterproof formula because of hayfever and allergies throughout the year. I haven't tried Physicians Formula for mascara yet - so cant give you feedback on that."
AustralianMakeup,2sdali,Iucrezia,1 point,Thu Jan 15 01:00:48 2015 UTC,Another vote for Essence mascaras. I was wary about them but decided to get a few during the Priceline 40% sale thinking I would just chuck them out if they irritated my eyes but they have been perfect. I find they don't flake either so I don't end up with raccoon eyes.
AustralianMakeup,2sdali,jen-iscool,1 point,Thu Jan 15 07:53:07 2015 UTC,"I've been using clump crusher since I bought it in the last priceline 40% off sale and have noticed it really seems to not agree with my eyes. I've always had issues with mascara but normally I was okay for most of the day and didn't start getting major irritation till towards the end of the day. With the CG mascara however I find that 5 minutes after putting it on my eyes hurt and begin to look red, and water somewhat excessively. Has anyone else had this issue? Are there any mascara so out there that might be formulated for easily irritated eyes that you know of?"

I did find they wore down within a couple of hours, and left behind a wicked stain that I actually enjoyed more than the colour of the original liquid! To be fair though, the ones I own are super bright shades."
AustralianMakeup,2s91h0,Jessijames,1 point,Tue Jan 13 05:42:52 2015 UTC,"Can I ask, did you try this with Show Pony? I tried applying, giving it time to dry and then blotting and it all came off. I'm wondering if maybe the other colours apply a bit differently? I might have to try swatching the others in store, if i ever find a well stocked Chi Chi stand"
AustralianMakeup,2s91h0,artsandcrass,1 point,Tue Jan 13 05:53:02 2015 UTC,"I have Show Pony and this is similar to how I apply it. Sometimes I'll dust it with some finishing powder through tissue if I want it to set a little more and last a little longer. It doesn't completely set, but I love the stain that is left behind a few hours later. Usually the stain lasts all day and I'll reapply a few more times if I feel like it.   I'm not really bothered by the fact that it's not matte.  Surprisingly, it's one of my favourite lipsticks."
AustralianMakeup,2s91h0,panda_bear88,2,Tue Jan 13 07:44:54 2015 UTC,"I really do like the colour. But if a product has matte in the name then I feel like it should be matte you know?  When I first got it, I tried to blot and apply finishing powder using a  halved tissue but I literally couldn't get enough of the product to stay on my lips and I feel like if I tried to dust powder without a tissue or something on top it would end up looking like sugar dusting if that makes sense.   Mine doesn't seem to set at all. Like there's no difference in texture or finish between when I apply and even 30 mins later and within about two hours, it literally disappears off my lips.   I feel like if it's really that different on other people and everyone else has had good experiences, then maybe I have gotten a bad batch or something? :/   I did contact Chi Chi but they seemed to not even consider that as a possibility so I guess I'm just stuck with it   Edited cause premature savulation"
AustralianMakeup,2s91h0,artsandcrass,4,Tue Jan 13 08:19:50 2015 UTC,Do you have the Australis Matte Me lip base? I find it can help with overly creamy formulas. But it doesn't work so well when you layer too much product.
AustralianMakeup,2s91h0,Jessijames,1 point,Tue Jan 13 09:20:49 2015 UTC,"Ooh that is such a good idea! I don't know why I didn't think of trying that, thank you for the suggestion."
AustralianMakeup,2s91h0,missbo,2,Tue Jan 13 10:08:47 2015 UTC,"Hmm. It's odd that your lipstick wears off so quickly. My sister also has Show Pony and it stains all day as well. Maybe you could try putting Lipcote lipstick sealer on top?   I bought some during the last Priceline sale and it is freaking amazing. It lasts even if you've had food and drinks. I haven't used it on top of liquid lipsticks, but I guess it would still work."

It is frustrating though that they send PR stock to international youtubers where most of the viewers can't purchase yet.
AustralianMakeup,2s8a6v,missbo,1 point,Tue Jan 13 02:53:47 2015 UTC,thanks for the info! will give it till mid feb then and then think about getting stuff forwarded if they still arent offering aus shipping by then.

I used a freight forwarder and got then just before Xmas. I had a hard time narrowing it down to these 7 items. I was only going to get 6, but if you sign up for their news letter you get a $5 voucher.   They. Are. Amazing.  but they are amazing in the context that I am an ""alternative"" person and they have a lot of things in the dark shades I struggle to find at Priceline, they are really inexpensive and quite high quality. The packaging is great- does not appear cheap in any way, love the lip colours and found the eye shadow to have really good wear time.   I'm happy to do some pics and swatches if anyone is interested."

AustralianMakeup,2s8a6v,sydneysomething,1 point,Tue Jan 13 06:57:21 2015 UTC,"Will do some swatches shortly.  It cost $15 to on-forward using Shipito (have always had good service with them), but it came in a massive box (US postage is only determined by weight, not volume which means they always use massive boxes), so if you had it consolidated down it might be cheaper."

AustralianMakeup,2s92xv,weirdhotalien,2,Tue Jan 13 05:26:54 2015 UTC,"I'm a NW20/25 with oily, acne pro-prom skin and the only one I've found that doesn't slide off is Maybelline FitMe (in 120) liquid. It's not a pure matte, but not shiny on me. I do use it with a primer and setting  powder as well, which of you have oily skin might also be necessary.    I haven't had any issues with it causing breakouts, but I do double cleanse at night (oil and foaming cleanser) to make sure it's completely off my skin.   I recommend waiting for it to go on sale, as its ~AUD20 normal price but frequently 30-50% off which makes it more reasonable."
AustralianMakeup,2s92xv,dark_lane,1 point,Tue Jan 13 07:04:52 2015 UTC,"I would recommend revlon colorstay foundation in Ivory (they do an oily skin version a normal/dry version) I prefer the whipped version but it has lighter coverage than the tube version. It's more medium/full coverage which is good for covering acne, I found that it's neutral on my skin and doesn't break me out further."
AustralianMakeup,2s92xv,lush1984,1 point,Tue Jan 13 08:36:51 2015 UTC,"I've used quite a few different foundations/BB creams (Maybelline FitMe, Revlon ColorStay, Palmer's BB Cream, Maybelline Dream Pure BB Cream For Oily Skin, Rimmel Match Perfection, CoverGirl TruBlend, Rimmel BB Cream, etc.) and hated alll of them, but I've found 2 that work for me so far.  CoverGirl 3-in-1 Stay Fabulous Foundation is my absolute favourite.  Although 820 (Lightest cool-toned shade available) is slightly too dark, I'm fairly sure they have 805 in other places that we don't, so your friend may be able to find it & send it to you.  It's a medium to full coverage, and I find I like it best when applied using a BeautyBlender.  Next up is something I've only used once & enjoyed, so I haven't had a chance to play around with it just yet, and it's the Rimmel Stay Matte Foundation (I use ""Fair Ivory"" which is the lightest cool-toned shade).  It's very thick & comes out to a very full coverage on me, but I've found it's the ONLY foundation to not slide off my nose & was still on there 6 hours later.  The only problem was that you could see tiny pin-pricks around my nose from my pores, so I'm going to use my Garnier 5 Second Blur or my Benefit Porefessional next time I use it & see if that helps."

AustralianMakeup,2s518j,alyss0r,5,Mon Jan 12 10:58:29 2015 UTC,"I think it's an absolute steal compared to other contour palettes that are available (ABH, Smashbox, Mac which are all $$$). I've held off until now, but after reading all these really great reviews, I'm totally going in for the kill. And I totally know how you feel, I'm trying to limit myself. I'm also eying off the Nars blush in sex appeal. Just sitting here fighting with myself like why WHY DO I NEED THIS I DON'T NEED THIS oh but so pretty.   Edit: should add that there ARE other relatively cheap contour palettes that don't come with as many shades, like Sleek and Nars. I just rediscovered my Sleek contour kit and now I'm back to doubting if I should buy it, even if it's $16.95 for 6 shades."
AustralianMakeup,2s518j,missreah,2,Mon Jan 12 12:47:10 2015 UTC,"Ehhh. Don't buy it. If you actually /need/ some contour and highlight, buy the sleek face form or contour palettes. That way you'll have more of the one shade you actually use, instead of six shades with like maybe 3 useful ones.   I bought the australis one and pretty much regret it because I will probably never use the two darker contour shades. Just my 2c. :)"

I don't think the price of shadows drops the more you buy (but I could be wrong). Maybe it's best to call them up?   But discount or no discount, the shadows are great quality and at a great price! And you can choose exactly what you want as well :)"
AustralianMakeup,2s6b9c,wendy_online,4,Mon Jan 12 20:35:05 2015 UTC,"If you can get to a physical store, they usually do 10-15% off in store a couple of times a year! Otherwise, no you don't get a discount for buying the palette full unless again they have a random in-store offer or something happening at the time. I usually buy the empty palette and a couple of shadows to start and then buy a new shadow to go into it every month or two but if you're not near a store and looking to buy online then you'd be best to buy it all at once! :)"
AustralianMakeup,2s5s6g,alyss0r,3,Mon Jan 12 12:51:42 2015 UTC,"If you want your post-inflammatory hyper-pigmention to fade faster, please  visit /r/AusSkincare :)  I make up my own salmon concealer with Maybelline Fit Me in 25 (orange based) with Maybelline under eye concealer in brightening (pink based). However, I've only used to for under eye bags, so I'm not sure about hyper-pigmentation, I think it may not be thick enough depending on the intensity of colouring."
AustralianMakeup,2s5s6g,MsOrangeCake,2,Tue Jan 13 00:51:40 2015 UTC,"I use the Australis 4-1 Conceal Correct. I haven't been using it very long but so far it seems to work. The green is very good. Both the orange shades are a bit more orangey than necessary, imho, but I do primer-concealer-powder-foundation, and that balances it out.  I also used to use the Maybelline green cover stick when I was a teenager and I remember it working pretty well."

AustralianMakeup,2s5cju,ErbiumIndium,9,Mon Jan 12 08:38:55 2015 UTC,I use a sunscreen+moisturizer combo and just let it sit longer (usually about 20 mins). Then I blot any excess grease off before applying makeup as usual. I don't reapply during the day though.
AustralianMakeup,2s5cju,panda_bear88,2,Mon Jan 12 08:43:04 2015 UTC,What product do you use? I'm on the lookout for a really good facial sunscreen.
AustralianMakeup,2s5cju,veritay,2,Mon Jan 12 08:43:52 2015 UTC,I've been using Nivea Day Cream for sensitive skin which is fairly thick. But I also like QV Day Cream which is thinner but makes a very tacky surface. I do plan on trying one of the Asian Skincare ones next though (I'm undecided which one to get at the moment).

Massive bottle, UVA,UVB and isn't oily at oil. If you let it sit for 5/10 minutes it'll go close to matte actually."
AustralianMakeup,2s5cju,seenoright,4,Tue Jan 13 05:53:02 2015 UTC,I just started using cetaphil Suntivity in the 30+ ultra light face fluid its designed to be worn under makeup. Its oil free and for very sensitive or oily skin. So far its been very good I bought it at priceline it was on sale too. I put it on after moisturizing and I just let it sit a few minutes before continuing my routine.

AustralianMakeup,2s5cju,liss29,7,Mon Jan 12 10:44:43 2015 UTC,"I use moisturiser then top with sunscreen. I use and definitely recommend the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Clear Face (SPF50 with helioplex) as it dries matte quickly and feels lightweight. It's also apparently oil free, PABA free and non-comedogenic. The fact it dries matte means it really doesn't interfere with my makeup at all.  I have melasma which darkens in the sun so my dermatologist recommended Neutrogena and I have to say, it is by far the best sunscreen I have used."
AustralianMakeup,2s5cju,paintedicecream,2,Mon Jan 12 09:53:05 2015 UTC,Do you just have to apply it once?
AustralianMakeup,2s5cju,liss29,2,Mon Jan 12 10:23:03 2015 UTC,"I think all sunscreens should be reapplied every 2 hours. However, I'm not in the sun all too much during the day due to work/uni. If I am going to spend longer periods in the sun i.e. the weekends,  and don't want to reapply because of makeup I'll just wear a hat. If I'm at the beach I'll just wear sunscreen, and sometimes tinted moisturiser, but make sure I reapply."

AustralianMakeup,2s5cju,trignometry,1 point,Sat Jan 24 00:43:43 2015 UTC,Does it really dry matte and quickly for you? I bought it a while ago but hardly ever use it as I feel like it takes too long to dry (and I don't have that kind of time in the morning) and it never dries matte! Maybe I got a bad batch or something...
AustralianMakeup,2s5cju,seenoright,2,Tue Jan 13 01:44:48 2015 UTC,"Mine doesn't dry matte and is quite oily and thick. I got it from Priceline and it was a Canadian one that they stuck a label on.  The natio SPF 50 is a lot less oily, more light and close to matte."
AustralianMakeup,2s5cju,liss29,1 point,Tue Jan 13 05:56:35 2015 UTC,They may have reformulated it? I know that it's now SPF 50 not 30 but that may just be a labelling thing. I'm also talking about the one in the fully white bottle not the one which is tinted blue with a blue cap (The blue one took forever to dry and was really quite greasy).   It'll take maybe 5 min to dry fully matte but I'm really impatient so I usually apply my makeup after 2-3 minutes!
AustralianMakeup,2s5cju,trignometry,1 point,Tue Jan 13 02:11:54 2015 UTC,Ah that's it I have the tinted blue one! I never knew their were two different kinds. What's the difference?
AustralianMakeup,2s5cju,liss29,2,Tue Jan 13 02:17:03 2015 UTC,I just tested both on my hands to be sure because I haven't worn the blue one in a while - The white bottle formula is a lot thinner and definitely feels more like a typical face sunscreen than the blue bottle. It was easier to rub in and within 30 seconds I couldn't tell I had applied it. Dried completely matte and undetectable.  My other hand which had the blue bottle sunscreen still has a greasy/slippery sort of film to it that is a bit shiny. I can feel it sitting on the skin. It's not absolutely terrible but it's definitely heavier.  I looked on the Australian Neutrogena website and I can't see the white bottle formula on there (weird). But my original link was to Priceline where they sell it. I hope that helps!
AustralianMakeup,2s5cju,trignometry,1 point,Tue Jan 13 04:19:30 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, so strange. Oh well, I'm glad I discovered I was just using the wrong product - I was wondering why people loved it so much! I use a couple of other sunscreens more often, maybe I'll keep that one for body use."

AustralianMakeup,2s5cju,acharlie,1 point,Mon Jan 12 14:40:54 2015 UTC,"It might be because you're using chemical sunscreens instead of physical ones. Physical sunscreens contain zinc oxide or titanium dioxide as a physical barrier against UVA/UVB rays, instead of using whatever it is they use in chemical sunscreens.  Physical sunscreens are much better for sensitive skin than chemical ones, I recommend you try Wotnot, Invisible Zinc, basically any sunscreen that markets itself as 'natural', or Google physical sunscreen and you should find some. :)"
AustralianMakeup,2s5cju,whereismydragon,2,Tue Jan 13 05:08:06 2015 UTC,"Moisturiser->tinted invisible zinc sunscreen because it hasn't got nasties in it->powder to kill the sunscreen sheen.   That's enough for most days.   Can put bb creme or foundation straight on top of that, set with a tiny bit more powder and it holds fine in sweaty weather."
AustralianMakeup,2s5cju,chelseanina,2,Mon Jan 12 14:38:24 2015 UTC,"I have been using Japanese sunscreens for about a year now, they typically sink in very quickly , have high SPF, and work well under makeup.  I used to use Biore Perfect milk, applied after moisturiser and before foundation. It is a thin liquid, it dries to a matte finish and works well as a primer. It has a high alcohol content so dries quickly, but can be quite drying during the day. It is a combined chemical/physical sunblock, so could also be applied before moisturizer IIRC.  I have also tried Shiseido Hada Senka UV Gel - this is also a very thin liquid, with a high alcohol content, but is less drying and mattifying than the perfect milk.  I am currently using Biore Watery Essence, which is more of a gel consistency compared to the perfect milk, and it also smells waaay better. This is a chemical sunblock, so I apply it before moisturiser. IT sinks in really quickly, once again due to it's alcohol content. It isn't as drying as the perfect milk, and because it isn't directly under my makeup it doesn't seem to have any effect on performance. My favourite thus far!  Both of these are SPF 50 and PA+++. They can be found at your local Japanese beauty store, or for us Kiwis that don't have these kinds of things Ebay is also a good option."
AustralianMakeup,2s5cju,seenoright,2,Tue Jan 13 01:56:24 2015 UTC,I have oily skin so I use a moisturising and mattifying sunscreen as a moisturiser and primer. Currently using SunSense daily face invisible tint finish. I'm not a huge fan of it as it's a little tacky and hard to apply. My HG is the Kit Cosmetics one but that's a little pricey.
AustralianMakeup,2s5obv,ermahgerdusername,2,Mon Jan 12 11:54:54 2015 UTC,I think they used to but last time I checked they only had nyx which is kinda weird. Try out bluescandal or beautyjoint. Beautyjoint is my personal favorite  because they seem to have lower prices for most things and they have always packed stuff well for me :)

AustralianMakeup,2s3caf,One_of_a_Kind,2,Thu Jan 15 05:10:53 2015 UTC,"I'm glad someone found this useful! There are very few differences between baby and mineral oil (just fragrance IIRC) and it shouldn't matter what oil you use, just as long as it has the power to get the gunk out!   You should definitely take photos though, it's like dirty brush porn ;)"

I hope I get those slimy bits washing out that you mentioned!"

AustralianMakeup,2ryq4j,Tea_inthegoodroom,1 point,Sat Jan 10 16:53:47 2015 UTC,"I found it very hard to find a priceline that stocked the lightest shade, 51 Light Vanilla. Or it was just so popular it flew off the shelves.  Lisa Eldridge did a video on pale foundations, two of the foundations mentioned are cheaper brands. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RQHn-uOWfw The Bourjois and L'Oreal Infallible Foundation. Edit: She also mentions Max Factor Lasting Performance, however the L'Oreal and Max Factor light shades are a cooler toned."
AustralianMakeup,2ryq4j,One_of_a_Kind,2,Sat Jan 10 21:57:48 2015 UTC,"Stock is definitely an issue since it's a pretty popular foundation. My local Priceline is pretty much always low on Shade 51 and 52 but the good thing is that there's also the Healthy mix foundation, which is pretty similar and gets equally good reviews.   I'm not sure about the L'oreal infallible foundation but their true match is pretty spot on for cool tones. Again, stock issue with these :P"

It's definitely got the neutral/yellow undertone thing going on.   If you've got normal/oily skin then get the Healthy Mix in light vanilla (sometimes called vanille clair) or if you've got dry skin get the Healthy Mix Serum formula in the same colour."
AustralianMakeup,2ryq4j,walkyouhome,1 point,Sat Jan 10 22:02:09 2015 UTC,If you like the formula of the W7 foundations you could add a white foundation to lighten them? Life's entropy sells a white foundation at http://shop.lifesentropy.com/. Unfortunately she's closed until 15/1/2015 but if you don't find anything before then it might be worth checking out? From memory the white foundation is about $7 USD.
AustralianMakeup,2ryq4j,MadDash88,1 point,Sun Jan 11 00:04:56 2015 UTC,"Get Bourjois healthy mix off asos. It's cheaper by over $10, on sale right now and has a much larger shade range (aus only has 3 shades excluding the lightest one which is available on asos.)"
AustralianMakeup,2ry4qo,jamballdonut,2,Sat Jan 10 08:10:54 2015 UTC,Isn't it goss who says to try around your chest/nape of your neck to match colours? That's how i was doing it in priceline the other week. I was getting strange looks everywhere.
AustralianMakeup,2ry4qo,listerS2,3,Sat Jan 10 10:24:57 2015 UTC,"Yep, you definitely do test it to your chest! I see people testing it to their hand all the time and I'm like ""wat r u doiiiiiing?!"""
AustralianMakeup,2ry4qo,panda_bear88,2,Sat Jan 10 11:28:04 2015 UTC,"I feel like I should mention that I can see the BB Cream matches my hand, but my hand is also a lot darker than my chest/face, hence why it being SO much darker than the foundation is a problem for me.  Just because I know some people will match face products on their arm/wrist/hand, but that doesn't work for me (or anyone??).  :)"
AustralianMakeup,2ry4qo,SEXPILUS,1 point,Sat Jan 10 08:11:42 2015 UTC,I have this same problem with concealer. Every place I go matches concealer to your hand (looking at you Mecca and MAC). My hand is nowhere near the colour of my face!
AustralianMakeup,2ry4qo,panda_bear88,2,Sat Jan 10 08:19:43 2015 UTC,"Oh god, I've never been colour-matched by anyone but myself, but if they did that to me I'd probably just laugh & ask if they're serious.  >____>"
AustralianMakeup,2ry4qo,_HappyG_,2,Sat Jan 10 08:28:57 2015 UTC,"That's just shitty customer service I think.   When I got matched to NARS sheer glow and creamy concealer I got lucky with the SA at Mecca and she took my makeup off and re-did it with those products (I hadn't said I was going to buy them either).  Once I wanted to try some nude lipsticks at MAC (a lipstick colour you neeeed to try on your face), and she just grabbed my hand and violently swatched like 10 PINK lipsticks.  I ended up going to Inglot where she picked up one, put it on me and it was perfect."
AustralianMakeup,2ry4qo,wildmareep,2,Sat Jan 10 08:44:14 2015 UTC,Yeah I just end up asking for a sample to try at home to make sure it looks right.
AustralianMakeup,2ry4qo,panda_bear88,1 point,Sat Jan 10 09:38:38 2015 UTC,"Haha, I've had that as well! It makes me just want to look up swatches from home and order online when I get a shipping code. It's like seriously?! I don't come to a counter to have an arm swatch, because I can do that on myself; and it really turns me off buying when I get bad customer service."
AustralianMakeup,2ry4qo,wildmareep,2,Sat Jan 10 12:16:09 2015 UTC,Why match to your hand when you could match to the inside of your wrist/arm just need to flip it over. Although that tends to be a bit lighter
AustralianMakeup,2ry4qo,_HappyG_,1 point,Sat Jan 10 10:19:37 2015 UTC,It's the staff that usually match it to my hand. Not me. Lol.

AustralianMakeup,2ry4qo,BBQsauceBel,2,Sat Jan 10 11:36:55 2015 UTC,What's your MAC shade? Are you looking for BB recs? I'm about NC20 and match pretty damn good to Skin79 Super BB in either Hot Pink or Gold. You can find little sampler packs on eBay for cheap too. Check out Ponds BB in Priceline too - it runs quite fair.   I've always matched to my jawline when sampling foundation products. Although this is no guarantee because sometimes foundations will oxidise on my oily t-zone. :P

Only annoying thing is the shade range is typical rimmel."
AustralianMakeup,2rvdeb,sarkata,1 point,Fri Jan 9 23:05:20 2015 UTC,"Here here! Also enjoy match perfection if you have drier skin, and wake me up if you don't mind shimmer or 'glow'. I break out if I breathe and none of these have broken me out...but like you said the shade range is painful. I find myself adding food colouring or turmeric to get it to match me lol"
AustralianMakeup,2rvdeb,gospursgo_,1 point,Sat Jan 10 11:19:12 2015 UTC,"Frustratingly, I don't know if it's australia wide on this release or just at the pricelines and targets and cws Ive looked at, the colour ranges don't line up. I ended up having to settle for 102 Light Nude in the original lasting finish and 200 soft beige in the nude. Keep in mind I'm super easy with foundation - im pretty neutral and can wear slightly cool or warm foundations, and I'm not super pale but im also well and truly in the ""light- light medium"" part of the spectrum.   Thankfully it worked out okay because the nude foundation is my go to for summer and I actually ended up getting a bit tanned this summer thanks to outdoor work, but ideally I'll probably have to reassess when winter comes back around. Thankfully it's cheap and lovely so I don't mind having a few bottles."
AustralianMakeup,2rvdeb,sarkata,2,Sat Jan 10 13:14:46 2015 UTC,I know you said you didn't think cover girl had enough coverage but maybe you could buy Ivory and creamy natural and mix them.
AustralianMakeup,2rvdeb,astateoffeels,2,Fri Jan 9 17:01:08 2015 UTC,"I really really like the Covergirl 3-in-1 Stay Fabulous foundation.  It's medium to full coverage, and I apply it with a Beauty Blender which sheers it out a little.  The only downside is the lowest colour isn't sold in Australia, so 810 is lightest yellow-based and 820 is the lightest pink-based.  I use 820 and still get a slight ""foundation mask"" if I don't blend it down my neck.  They're not available from Chemist Warehouse, but it is only $19.95 which is pretty decent for a foundation! :)"
AustralianMakeup,2rvdeb,jamballdonut,1 point,Sat Jan 10 06:29:52 2015 UTC,Revlon Colorstay is pink based as far as my samples went and the girl on counter told me too! Maybe you've got the wrong colour or it changes on your skin?
AustralianMakeup,2rvdeb,missbo,1 point,Fri Jan 9 17:07:54 2015 UTC,The two lightest colours are Buff and Nude...buff is way too yellow. Makes me look sick. Nude is...ok. I guess it's a pretty good match but it still doesn't really seem quite right.   Nude sometimes goes orange on me but I think that may be the concealer I use (that definitely goes orange) just spreading the love around.

AustralianMakeup,2ru8je,One_of_a_Kind,6,Fri Jan 9 08:20:23 2015 UTC,"SPONGES:  I wash my beauty blender every day before I use it. I have the beauty blender branded cleanser in both liquid and solid form, and while I bought the solid one to use when I travel, I actually prefer to use it every day just because it doesn't make as many suds as the liquid version so it's faster to rinse out when I'm in a rush in the morning. I wash it before rather than after I use it because you have to get the beauty blender wet to use it anyway, so I may as well do both those steps in one go.   BRUSHES:  I use MAC Brush Cleanser to spot clean my brushes. My powder and blush brushes (which I use every day I wear makeup) usually get spot cleaned every 1-3 uses.   Eye brushes I spot clean after each use because I don't want to muddy up the colours and I'm super prone to eye infections and styes. For cleaning your eye brushes while you're doing an eye look because you want to use a different colour with the same brush, I did recently find that running them over a hair bun/donut maker gets rid of the eye shadow amazingly well so you don't end up muddying up the colours!  For a deep clean, I used to use Johnson's Baby Shampoo but lately I've just been using my beauty blender liquid cleanser because I want to use it up. I just wet the brush under warm water, either dip the brush in some cleanser or squirt it into my palm, then work the brush in my palm either in circles or back and forth. And repeat if necessary especially for gunky foundation and blush brushes. Then I just lay them on their side over a towel (kinda like this) to dry. :)"
AustralianMakeup,2ru8je,chocolatespeckle,6,Fri Jan 9 09:00:42 2015 UTC,I bought a brush cleaner from ebay for around $2 (http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/New-Cleaning-Cosmetic-Makeup-Brush-Foundation-Brush-Silicone-Cleaner-Tool-BY-/201211723101?ssPageName=ADME:X:AAQ:AU:1123).

AustralianMakeup,2ru8je,panda_bear88,6,Fri Jan 9 08:53:33 2015 UTC,Don't get the sigma glove. You can get a silicone glove from Kmart/big w for $6. It does the same job
AustralianMakeup,2ru8je,panda_bear88,1 point,Fri Jan 9 09:47:14 2015 UTC,"I already own it and I don't like it that much.  I think I originally got the reccomendation from a brush cleaning thread you did/commented in. It is not bad, but doesn't work as well with the smaller eye brushes."
AustralianMakeup,2ru8je,artsandcrass,2,Fri Jan 9 10:46:22 2015 UTC,As I see your image below. I have the one from Kmart and the surface is different. I never had a problem using mine before.
AustralianMakeup,2ru8je,Tonkie,1 point,Sat Jan 10 06:06:05 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I really like the checkerplate pattern the sigma sample glove has. I'll check out Kmarts gloves next time I'm there, as $50 is really too much for a silicone glove."
AustralianMakeup,2ru8je,danijhug,2,Sat Jan 10 08:40:34 2015 UTC,Haha! I never even noticed that.   The shipping was much faster than I thought as well. I didn't expect it to come so soon after ordering (since it was cheap and free shipping) but it only took about a week. Was pleasantly surprised.
AustralianMakeup,2ru8je,breviloquent-,5,Fri Jan 9 09:40:26 2015 UTC,"I wash mine once a week on the weekend,  or sometimes stretch it to 2  if I haven't worn makeup many days.  I have a powder brush,3 liquid foundation brushes, and 2  blush brushes  and 2 concealer brushes that are regularly used, then a few others that might get use here or there if I am playing around with highlights or lips or some eyeshadow. Most of them are Real Techniques.  I currently use a block of soap in a dish (it is L'Occitane Shea butter soap).  I wet the brush, wet the soap, then swirl the brush into the soap to pick up some lather. Then I swirl the brush in my hand and run under water til clear/not soapy.    Then I swirl the brush on a towel to get most of the wet out, sometimes rinse and repeat.  Then I wrap a hair tie around the handle and wrap it round the towel rail so the brush is hanging upside down!"
AustralianMakeup,2ru8je,Tea_inthegoodroom,3,Fri Jan 9 09:01:49 2015 UTC,"I try and wash mine about once a week (unfortunately this doesn't always happen).  I do a mix of anti-bacterial soap one wash and then good quality Shampoo and Conditioner the next wash. The soap cleans them really well, but the Shampoo/Conditioner makes them feel like new again. I tried combining the two methods but the smells of all the products didn't mix well and it smelt really bad.  I'm hopeless at getting the foundation out of sponges unless I wash them straight away, so I just bought a heap of cheap ones and throw them out when they get yucky.  Using hair-ties to hang them on a towel rack upside-down I find works best for me."
AustralianMakeup,2ru8je,nixedreamer,3,Fri Jan 9 08:58:54 2015 UTC,I wash my brushes whenever I remember (I rarely wear makeup excluding the holidays) and I wash them with Daiso Puff + Sponge and use a lid of one of my tubs which has ridges on it to work the product out.
AustralianMakeup,2ru8je,Flippantry,3,Fri Jan 9 09:07:23 2015 UTC,"1) Every 3 - 4 weeks (gross I know), beautyblender sponge gets cleaned every 3 - 4 uses  2) Beautyblender cleanser for face and eye brushes. Eyeliner and eyebrow brushes get alcohol + beautyblender cleanser.  3) Beautyblender cleanser but I'm still hunting for the Daiso puff and sponge soap  4) Johnson & Johnson baby shampoo, Mecca brush cleaner (spot cleaning)  5) Wet the sponge and squeeze out as much water as possible. Spray or dip a little into isopropanol, squish around under running water then go in with a brush cleaner  6) Clothes hanger + rubber band or laid flat on a clean towel  7) Not really a fail, but I found that the using a brush cleaner is better at getting rid of foundation and eyeshadow staining on white bristles than a baby shampoo"
AustralianMakeup,2ru8je,Flippantry,3,Fri Jan 9 09:37:53 2015 UTC,"Not that often, I don't do my makeup much. I'll clean my eye brushes after using them or else colour transfers.  Baby shampoo. I circle them on my palm until it foams and the water runs clear and then I rinse. Johnson's baby shampoo.  Lots of squeezing when cleaning!  Line them up on a towel and make sure the bristles are positioned nicely. I leave them to dry overnight.  I don't have any, baby shampoo has always worked.    Hope this helps :)"
AustralianMakeup,2ru8je,Tickle_Me_Tortoise,3,Fri Jan 9 10:26:36 2015 UTC,"I try to wash my brushes quite frequently, I prioritise my foundation brushes and sponges most of all whereas my eyeshadow and contour brushes tend to go a bit longer (either due to not using them as much or having a few different ones I cycle through).  I used to use a combo of dishwashing detergent + olive oil to both clean and keep them soft and moisturised however I now actually use SARD's Wonder Soap which costs like $2.90 for a bar.  It's REALLY good at getting my sponges SO clean too.  I recently gave one of my older Real Techniques sponges a thorough wash and the change was amazing (I wish I'd  taken photos).    I just wet the brush, get a gentle lather going with the SARD and work it through with my fingers. I try to softly squeeze any excess water out and place them on some paper towel, slightly raised with the brush head downwards so the water dries out."
AustralianMakeup,2ru8je,makeup_lady,1 point,Fri Jan 9 10:31:10 2015 UTC,"I bought a lump of SARD as my baby shampoo ran out. It works well, thank you."
AustralianMakeup,2ru8je,wendy_online,2,Fri Jan 9 11:48:49 2015 UTC,"That's great :D It lasts so long too, I'm still on my first bar!"
AustralianMakeup,2ru8je,jamballdonut,3,Thu Jan 15 05:01:01 2015 UTC,"How frequently: I wash my liquid foundation (well, BB cream) brush after every single use, because it grosses me out otherwise and I only have one brush right now. Eyeshadow brushes are generally  cleansed more than fully washed, usually after every use and more to remove product than anything else, and generally the others are powder use only and are done every now and again, either cleanses or fully washed. I wouldn't go longer than a month between full washes.  How/with what: Generally for a full wash and always for my foundation brush I use some sort of soap, water and a mini Sigma mitt that I got as a freebie. The soap varies from BE antibacterial brush cleanser from Priceline to Dettol antibacterial handwash to whatever is in the bathroom at the time. I'm not picky and they all seem to work just as well as each other, though I do prefer that whatever I'm using has antibacterial properties. Then I wipe them on a clean towel, may or may not put on a brush guard, and then lay them flat to dry. I stopped hanging them upside down a while ago after I read that can affect the glue.   For an inbetween/quick cleanse, so say for my blusher brush or eyeshadow brushes, and more to remove product than anything else, I either use a Simple makeup remover wipe or some Mac brush cleanser fluid on a cotton pad or tissue. Depends on how lazy I am being and how long it's been since their last full wash. Also almost all my shadow brushes that I like to use are double ended, and it's easier to cleanse after every use than to do a full wash.   Basically to learn how to do it I just watched a couple of YouTube videos on how to wash makeup brushes (Lauren Curtis has a good one) and read a bunch of posts on MUA and went from there. I'm not acne prone (all my acne is hormone related from PCOS, sadly) and I'm lazy, so I'm not the most thorough. I do feel like Dettol antibacterial handwash cleans better than anything else I have used and often gets the tips of my Real Techniques foundation brushes back to white. I'm also not too concerned on destroying my brushes as I feel like the ones I use wouldn't be that expensive to replace."
AustralianMakeup,2rue2v,thelocalcunt,7,Fri Jan 9 09:50:06 2015 UTC,"Wayne Goss has a really old video about hiding bags. Worth a watch because he demonstrates how to conceal the shadow, not the bag and it's amazing!"
AustralianMakeup,2rue2v,missbo,3,Fri Jan 9 11:28:09 2015 UTC,"I saw a post on MUA a while back using Laura Mercier secret brightening powder to conceal eye bags and it seemed really good, so maybe look into that. The Rimmel Wake Me Up under eye concealer is useless, so I can suggest you avoid that."
AustralianMakeup,2rue2v,Tickle_Me_Tortoise,2,Fri Jan 9 12:47:46 2015 UTC,give nars radiant creamy concealer a try?   otherwise bobbi brown cprrector/concealer!
AustralianMakeup,2rue2v,gospursgo_,1 point,Fri Jan 9 10:27:49 2015 UTC,"Second this, with a finely milled setting powder."
AustralianMakeup,2rue2v,Tea_inthegoodroom,2,Fri Jan 9 10:39:34 2015 UTC,"There are actually products designed to be painted over the eyes and force them down,  they're supposed to be able to be used under makeup, but they seem like they could be tight or uncomfortable. Most methods such as applying patches or topical creams and cooling the area are only temporary, but depending on the cause (such as tiredness or fluid retention) it could be something to discuss with her GP.  As for cosmetic cover, it depends on whether her eyes are discoloured, if so a colour corrector works best; if not it's important to avoid layering too much, especially if she has aging skin as it can settle in fine lines. Basically you need to contour them in the same way as you would your cheekbones, darker on areas you want to recede and lighter on areas you want to bring forth. Obviously not as deep and distinct, but skintone concealer or slightly darker, and avoiding highlighter beneath the eyes. It's important to note that mature skin can be very delicate and sag, so avoid applying loads of products, set with a fine powder, and mattes flatter wrinkled, puffy and hooded eyes."
AustralianMakeup,2rue2v,_HappyG_,1 point,Fri Jan 9 13:29:06 2015 UTC,Origins eyecreme is really good for dark circles. I have chronic dark circles no matter how much sleep I get! And this works a dream. I also use a Bobbi brown corrector first then I use nars dadiant creamy concealer then finish with a light dusting off translucent setting powder from Ben bye.   Short version. Use a corrector! Peach salmon or red will work depending on the color of her darkness.   Hope that helps :) x ☺
AustralianMakeup,2ru3y5,coke21,7,Fri Jan 9 07:14:40 2015 UTC,"The unfortunate part about oxidisation that it will be different for everybody as it's generally a result of a combination of your own skins nature and the concealers ingredients. What doesn't go orange for one person may go orange for you.   The best thing I could recommend if you can bear it would be to go into priceline with some cotton buds and place a swatch under your jawline of a few different ones, go for a walk around for half an hour or so and then check it out in natural light to see if any/which do and don't go orange! :-)"
AustralianMakeup,2ru3y5,Jessijames,3,Fri Jan 9 08:04:59 2015 UTC,"A good idea. Concealers are definitely a personal thing, and what works really varies, all you need to do is look at the very mixed reviews they all have on the Sephora (US) website.  A lot of people love Maybelline Fit Me, but it creased a lot for me. I use the Clinique AirBrush Concealer for under my eyes and Benefit Boi-ing for general concealing. Boi-ing in particular, suffered from very mixed reviews."
AustralianMakeup,2ru3y5,One_of_a_Kind,1 point,Fri Jan 9 08:14:15 2015 UTC,"What's cute is that my local Priceline has small tubes of cotton buds hanging from the sides of the displays for exactly this purpose.  OP also don't be afraid to get matched by someone. There is no shame in walking in bare-faced to make sure you get the perfect fit. As always, wait a little and then walk outside to see how it looks. Best of luck!"
AustralianMakeup,2ru3y5,missb00,1 point,Fri Jan 9 16:24:15 2015 UTC,"This. It's so variable.   Having said that, I swear by Revlon Colorstay for blemishes but I wouldn't recommend it for undereyes as it's got salacylic acid in it. I wear NP Set concealer in the pen for my undereyes. I like it."
AustralianMakeup,2ru3y5,BBQsauceBel,1 point,Mon Jan 12 05:05:22 2015 UTC,"Other than ones already mentioned, I've found Nude By Nature's new concealer to be quite nice and I haven't noticed any oxidation.  I've also tried Benefit's Fake Up which didn't oxidise for me but did crease.  A bit pricier but NARS' radiant creamy concealer has got pretty rave reviews (do test this first if you can though just in case, because dat price).   I found Bourjois' healthy mix concealer went a little warm for me about 30 minutes into wear so I wouldn't recommend that concealer."
AustralianMakeup,2rtp9a,Jessijames,5,Fri Jan 9 04:33:22 2015 UTC,I don't think you'll have much luck at either of those stores for a pale BB cream. Most people would go for an Asian brand or maybe the MAC BB cream for fair shades.
AustralianMakeup,2rtp9a,SEXPILUS,1 point,Fri Jan 9 04:44:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I figured as much but thought I'd ask anyway! I have tried a few of the Skin79 BB's and they're not too bad shade-wise but they are so so thick and heavy on my skin that I couldn't stand them! Do you know of any of the Asian brand BB creams in particular that may be a little lighter in texture?"
AustralianMakeup,2rtp9a,panda_bear88,3,Fri Jan 9 04:50:27 2015 UTC,"I would like to say Pond's flawless white BB cream, but it is not matte so it might not be right for your oily skin."
AustralianMakeup,2rtp9a,panda_bear88,1 point,Fri Jan 9 04:44:11 2015 UTC,I remember you've mentioned this one before and am thinking of trying it. Would it be light enough for NW10-15 or so?
AustralianMakeup,2rtp9a,panda_bear88,2,Fri Jan 9 04:50:58 2015 UTC,It's the lightest one I was able to find in store. It has a grey tone unlike most other BB creams you would find at priceline. I personally prefer my Missha BB because the texture is lighter. I have it in #13 (the lightest shade) and I love it. If your interested in trying the Missha one shoot me a PM and I'll send you a little sample pot from my stash for you to try.  Edit: I can send you a sample jar of the ponds one too.
AustralianMakeup,2rtp9a,BBQsauceBel,1 point,Fri Jan 9 05:05:36 2015 UTC,Oooooh! Are they both light or heavy in texture?
AustralianMakeup,2rtp9a,listerS2,1 point,Fri Jan 9 05:17:54 2015 UTC,Missha is lighter coverage than the Ponds BB. Both are lighter than foundation. I personally don't need too much coverage these days. I actually have TheFaceShop Magic Cover BB in #1 too which is a pretty full on coverage for a BB (It's essentially my foundation replacement) It's a liquid to powder formula.
AustralianMakeup,2rtp9a,BBQsauceBel,1 point,Fri Jan 9 05:27:27 2015 UTC,Interesting! I will pop into Priceline and try to grab a swatch of the Ponds. Thank you PB! :)
AustralianMakeup,2rtp9a,halfhouse,5,Fri Jan 9 06:21:08 2015 UTC,"Nope. Honestly it will take a bit of time and effort but buy a real Asian one online. You won't regret it! I use Skin 79 Super BB (Gold) and love it. (You can buy small sampler boxes online).   I bought the Ponds BB in Priceline for funsies and it just does not compare! OK shade-wise, but it just felt thick and pasty compared to my Skin 79.  :(   I have weird skin - combination but sensitive and acne prone, plus I'm quite fair. Many foundations do not last on my skin but my BB does. Looks natural and luminous too."
AustralianMakeup,2rtp9a,thefinish,2,Fri Jan 9 06:37:03 2015 UTC,"You must be my skin sister, thanks for the tip with the BB, been scouting for one like this!"

AustralianMakeup,2rtp9a,sarkata,1 point,Fri Jan 9 07:09:21 2015 UTC,Isn't that interesting! I guess everyone is different. You might like the Ponds then. :)
AustralianMakeup,2rtp9a,tanoshiiki,1 point,Fri Jan 9 08:36:54 2015 UTC,Unfortunately don't have the same skin type so your YMMV on my recs but I've been pretty happy with the garnier bb cream -  I've been using  the normal version but I'm fairly certain there's one formula specifically for oily skin. Not a bb cream but I really also like the loreal lumi magique foundation it's very light and blendable and you get a bit of coverage. Maybe with a primer for oily skin it could work too?
AustralianMakeup,2rtp9a,sydneysomething,1 point,Fri Jan 9 08:11:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the rec, I've heard mixed reviews on the garnier but it was definitely on my radar to look in to!"
AustralianMakeup,2rtp9a,tanoshiiki,2,Fri Jan 9 08:23:36 2015 UTC,"I'd be careful with it, tbh. I'm fairly pale, and am using the palest shade in the middle of summer.  They also seem to tend towards the orange end of the spectrum - when I first started using it in October (when I was still pale from winter), it was too orange for the paler parts of my face/neck. And even now, I still have to blend it out so much to stop my neck from being orange :/   Having said that, I've found the shades inconsistent between the oily/sensitive etc. so maybe the oily one would be okay for you? So yeah, as the commenter above me, I'd see if you can try it before you buy. But I do really love the texture and finish to it so if it works for you that's great!"
AustralianMakeup,2rtp9a,echoecho9,1 point,Fri Jan 9 11:17:25 2015 UTC,Good luck on the hunt! :) It's definitely a struggle finding the perfect base products.
AustralianMakeup,2rtp9a,missb00,1 point,Fri Jan 9 08:30:33 2015 UTC,"It's a lovely product (my staple go-to during summer), but I use the lightest shade and im sort of medium/light during the summer so I'd definitely try before you buy if possible. If you do look at it, definitely look at the Oil Free variety rather than any of the others - I've tried several, and there's something special about that one. Not high coverage, but remarkably good at evening skin tone and a lot more lightweight than say the pure active acne one or the normal skin one."
AustralianMakeup,2rtp9a,crispy_pork_chop,1 point,Fri Jan 9 09:01:29 2015 UTC,I second the Garnier too. I use the Oily skin one in Light.
AustralianMakeup,2rtp9a,panda_bear88,5,Fri Jan 9 09:56:51 2015 UTC,"The garnier one is like...tan on me, I wouldn't say it's pale at all."
AustralianMakeup,2rtp9a,missb00,1 point,Fri Jan 9 10:44:49 2015 UTC,"Interesting. It's definitely not the lightest product I've used, but to say tan is quite dramatic. I'm not overly familiar with MAC shade conversions, but apparently it's like a NC20, so definitely not super pale. Garnier BB Creams get mixed reviews and I think it's because their BB Cream formulations vary widely between the ranges, e.g. oily, normal, sensitive, acne-prone, etc plus they can be prone to oxidisation."
AustralianMakeup,2rtp9a,panda_bear88,1 point,Fri Jan 9 23:39:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, garnier is orange on me too."
AustralianMakeup,2rtp9a,gospursgo_,1 point,Wed Jan 14 01:50:53 2015 UTC,"Sorry to piggyback off this thread, but I was actually going to ask this very question! After seeing the recs for Asian BB creams, I took a look and found this. Is it worth buying? Shipping is $8 and hopefully there's something that'll suit me in there. For reference, I have similar skin to OP =]"
AustralianMakeup,2rtp9a,gospursgo_,1 point,Fri Jan 9 13:46:59 2015 UTC,"Asian BB creams are much thicker in texture than what is sold as BB creams by some of the western brands (such as Garnier, Maybelline etc). I find that it's much closer to foundation but with a much more limited selection of shades. That said, I love Skin79 but only tend to wear them in winter when my skin is lighter. I find blending with fingers the best way but if you're looking for matte skin, Skin79 may not suit as it gives a dewy finish. I've got the Oriental Gold, Hot Pink, one of the Diamond ones, not sure which. They all have a slight greyish cast to them, which is quite common with many Asian BB creams."
AustralianMakeup,2rqi2w,Flippantry,8,Thu Jan 8 11:53:00 2015 UTC,"I'll go first of course!  A few of my favourites were:  Urban Decay Naked 3 Palette - a real love or hate piece I've found (after lurking on /r/makeupaddiction), I just loved the roses and golds on my skin tone.  I'll agree it's not super flexible in terms of looks you can create but it's still a super lovely palette and one of my first nicer eye-shadow buys   Missha M BB Cream - Love this so much, just the right amount of coverage for my everyday looks.   Stila Stay All Day Liner - I was late to bandwagon on this, it's so great.  Long lasting, doesn't smudge or transfer, good pigmentation and easy to apply."

AustralianMakeup,2rqi2w,chocolatespeckle,6,Fri Jan 9 12:04:49 2015 UTC,"This year was the first year I 'got in to make up', I have really only bought drugstore / Target brands but here are my favourites anyway! In no particular order...   Maybelline Full'n'Soft Mascara. Does wonders on my lashes, removes easily, and I wear it almost every day. Maybelline Colour Tattoo pot in Barely Branded. Perfect brow highlighter for my skin tone. Often I only wear that on my eyes, aside from mascara. NYX Matte Lipstick in 'Perfect Red'. Name says it all. It is pretty perfect! I definitely want to get more colours from this range. Nude by Nature 8 piece Brush Set. My first brushes! I have definitely come to use 3 of these almost every day. The blush brush, lipstick brush, and slanted/diagonal eye shadow brush. I felt so pro when I got these, haha. some cheap-as-chips blush from K-mart. Definitely meant for the tween market and I think it was only $2. It was my first blush, so I didn't want to spend a fortune, or even a small fortune, or even a pittance. I didn't realise blush could change the shape and prominence of my cheekbones so much, so even though this was a random purchase, definitely one of my best buys! I will upgrade to a better blush at some point ;)"
AustralianMakeup,2rqi2w,chocolatespeckle,3,Thu Jan 8 12:46:54 2015 UTC,I have a Colour Tattoo in Barely Beige which is very similar and it's also one of my favourite purchases from this year! They work so well by themselves when you just want a quick slight wash of colour on your lids :)
AustralianMakeup,2rqi2w,chocolatespeckle,3,Thu Jan 8 14:23:09 2015 UTC,"Cheap blushes can still be excellent, so if that one from K-Mart works well, don't even worry about it!

AustralianMakeup,2rqi2w,chocolatespeckle,2,Thu Jan 8 12:48:56 2015 UTC,This mention of the essence gel pencils is what prompted me to give them a go. The texture of them is dead-on for a gel liner and I'll definitely be grabbing all the colours!
AustralianMakeup,2rqi2w,mcmal,2,Sat Jan 10 12:35:20 2015 UTC,so glad you liked them! theyre my faves...especially for the price!
AustralianMakeup,2rqi2w,chocolatespeckle,6,Sat Jan 10 13:32:07 2015 UTC,"Probably my Maybelline Master Precise eyeliner, I'm definitely getting better at wings now and the thin tip helps me not to over-line my hooded lids. Also the Maybelline Color Tattoos, I have a few and want most of the rest. They're so easy to apply when you're stretched for time."
AustralianMakeup,2rqi2w,missbo,3,Thu Jan 8 13:04:50 2015 UTC,"Missha Perfect Cover BB Cream I love the coverage of this.   Kiss Me Heroine Long and Curl This was the best find. After trying so many mascaras, I figured my downward straight lashes were just way too stubborn to hold a curl. But this is perfect and holds a curl all day.   Hourglass Ambient Lighting Blush Palette I was never a blush person but after buying this, it's a sample in my routine. I love the subtle, but buildable colours and how pigmented it is.   Etude House Drawing Eyebrow Pencil in brown-gray perfect match for my brows that makes it look natural."
AustralianMakeup,2rqi2w,chocolatespeckle,3,Thu Jan 8 14:09:31 2015 UTC,I'm going to Hong Kong in a month and I can't wait to pick up some Kiss Me Heroine Make Mascara as everyone raves about it. I have high hopes!
AustralianMakeup,2rqi2w,missbo,3,Thu Jan 8 14:25:06 2015 UTC,I hope it doesn't disappoint you! I use the Shiseido curler to get the perfect curl and them slather the mascara on. It's really hard to remove though and use mineral oil to get it off.
AustralianMakeup,2rqi2w,chocolatespeckle,3,Thu Jan 8 15:04:38 2015 UTC,I'll be holding you accountable if it doesn't work out :P Have you tried the mascara remover that they sell alongside the mascara? I'll probably pick that up while I'm at it.  And your comment just reminded me I need a new eyelash curler! Am tossing up between Shiseido and Shu Uemura...
AustralianMakeup,2rqi2w,missbo,3,Fri Jan 9 09:59:49 2015 UTC,"Hahah dear god then I hope it works for you!!!! No, I haven't tried the remover, I'm too cheap and don't want to pay another $20 for it! Bloody Australian prices!!   I prefer the Shiseido curler, probably suits my eye shape more and able to grab all my lashes and curls so well. Maybe you could buy both since they will be so much cheaper in Hong Kong.   Also have you tried the Fairy Drops Platinum mascara or the volume burst one? I've heard good things about those as well and want to try them next."
AustralianMakeup,2rqi2w,chocolatespeckle,3,Fri Jan 9 15:28:42 2015 UTC,Aw I think it's juust under AU$10 in HK so I can pick one up for you if you like while I'm over there! Although I'm not sure how much shipping within Australia would be so you might only save a couple of dollars :(  Yes maybe I'll just have to pick up both! And no I haven't tried either of those mascaras. Although I just googled them and I'm sure I recognise the packaging and that wand (unless there are other brands that do it too). Honestly I've always been so intimidated looking at Asian-brand makeup that I've hardly tried anything. Thank you so much for the recommendations :)
AustralianMakeup,2rqi2w,sarkata,3,Fri Jan 9 20:54:49 2015 UTC,"You're too sweet for the offer. But that's ok, my oil cleanser works well enough for me.   If you haven't already, check out the asianbeauty sub. May be overwhelming at first, but I've fallen in love with Asian skincare. While you're in HK you should check out the sunscreens and sheet masks. I have same samples I can send you too if you're interested!"
AustralianMakeup,2rqi2w,xViscera,2,Fri Jan 9 21:46:09 2015 UTC,I've stumbled across it but never really given it a good look. But I'll definitely have a look for some recs and HG products before I go! I actually feel really happy with my makeup collection right now and can't actually think of anything I might want to get... but we'll see ;) And thank you for the offer! I'll let you know if there's anything I'm particularly interested it :D
AustralianMakeup,2rqi2w,sydneysomething,2,Sun Jan 11 11:48:34 2015 UTC,Jealous. I hope you do some amazing shopping.
AustralianMakeup,2rqi2w,sydneysomething,2,Thu Jan 8 14:39:13 2015 UTC,"Sadly the exchange rate is pretty bad right now, so lots of things are even cheaper in Australia (what), but I'll definitely pick up some Asian-brand makeup!"
AustralianMakeup,2rqi2w,petiteaustralienne,3,Fri Jan 9 09:57:02 2015 UTC,Can I recommend you exchange the bulk of your money in Chungking Mansion on Nathan Rd in Tsim Sha Tsui if you're going to Kowloon. Best rates are at Singapore Exchange and Western Union. It's a dodgy looking little mall but it's full of money changers and I swear by them.

AustralianMakeup,2rqi2w,petiteaustralienne,2,Thu Jan 8 14:56:46 2015 UTC,"F-Yeah, Stay Matte Powder.  I was pretty late to that bandwagon, I only picked up one about a month or so ago and damn does it work well.  I just assumed it wouldn't really work great for me since I have dry skin and don't go out of my way for that matte look but it's just the perfect powder on top of my BB cream to smooth it out (and make sure my face doesn't transfer onto other objects lol!)  Swatches are always welcome :D  If you get a chance, do post them to the subreddit so it gets good visibility!"

AustralianMakeup,2rqi2w,panda_bear88,3,Fri Jan 9 03:01:23 2015 UTC,"It's the  Hourglass illusion tinted moisturiser rebranded and repackaged. It's due to come to Mecca in Jan/Feb and I would 100% hold off until it does because it is now in a tube, getting it out of the (old packaging)glass pump bottle is a massive pain in the potatoes"

AustralianMakeup,2rqi2w,chelseanina,2,Sat Jan 10 10:14:19 2015 UTC,I believe it used to be called Illusion tinted moisturiser or something along those lines? It's the same product though just renamed! And I think it used to have a pump but now has a squeeze tube.
AustralianMakeup,2rqi2w,trignometry,3,Sat Jan 10 12:39:59 2015 UTC,"I went really silly in 2014 for makeup. I even stopped partying just so I could spend my extra money on it (Awesome Change).  I would have to say, my Real Techniques brushes and my MAC 217. I cant remember what bushes I used before them but now I use them every day and they have just changed the way I wear make up.   Also my AC palette, I use this everyday, it hides all my under eye bags.  (Non Product)In 2014 I have learned that I don't need to cake on my makeup for it to look amazing and I dont have to conceal my freckles"
AustralianMakeup,2rqi2w,makeup_lady,2,Thu Jan 8 22:50:10 2015 UTC,Is the 217 worth the money? I'm thinking of picking one up because of the reviews and my current blending brushes just don't cut it anymore. Is there a noticeable difference in your eyeshadow?
AustralianMakeup,2rqi2w,chocolatespeckle,1 point,Mon Jan 12 12:33:00 2015 UTC,"I don't own the MAC 217, but a good dupe, Sigma's E25. It is my equal favourite brush, along with the Sigma E35. I can finally apply eyeshadow subtly, and there is very little fall out. There is no struggle to apply eyeshadow either. I personally feel that good brushes are more important than good makeup. (But if you can afford both, even better!)"
AustralianMakeup,2rqi2w,makeup_lady,2,Wed Jan 14 11:09:36 2015 UTC,"picked up a 217 yesterday with some Myer gift cards, I can't wait to use it tomorrow!"
AustralianMakeup,2rqi2w,chocolatespeckle,3,Wed Jan 14 13:07:01 2015 UTC,"Mine would be the Hourglass Ambient blush in Mood exposure, Australis Velourlips in Grandmaster Pash, Too Faced Melted Liquid Lipstick in Fig and the DS Fresh Sugar Lip Balm I bought on a whim. I'm dying to get a full sized now once I work through the rest of my lip balm collection."
AustralianMakeup,2rqi2w,makeup_lady,3,Thu Jan 8 22:56:44 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, Grandmaster Pash is amazing, I'm hoping Australis takes the hint and makes more of the Velourlips in deeper colours.  The formula is nice but the standard colours, whilst beautiful, are very bright."
AustralianMakeup,2rqi2w,makeup_lady,3,Thu Jan 8 23:49:25 2015 UTC,I feel that I could wear Grandmaster Pash every day and never get bored of it. I hope they make the AC/ME velourlips permanent. And yes they definitely need deeper shades. I'd love it if they could make colours similar to grunge in their colour inject line.
AustralianMakeup,2rqi2w,One_of_a_Kind,3,Thu Jan 8 23:58:14 2015 UTC,Grandmaster Pash will probably be on my list for this year. I picked it up on a whim about a week ago because of this subreddit and as soon as I tried it I fell instantly in love with it.
AustralianMakeup,2rqi2w,makeup_lady,3,Sat Jan 17 10:59:35 2015 UTC,"I'm only new to makeup too, but these are the ones I always reach for:  NYX Diamond Sparkle Lipstick in Sparkling Salmon love the colour, but the glitter can get a bit too much. Rimmel Lasting finish lipstick in Nude Pink : This is my HG right now. APIVITA Lipcare with chamomile, for when I'm not wearing lipstick. ELF eyelid primer in Sheer, I know it's cheap but I love the colouring. Maybelline Define-a-lash mascara in waterproof, I've bought a bunch of mascaras so far and this one is my fave. Lastly: Physician's Formula Natural Nude pallette, so much can be done with that little square of goodness!"
AustralianMakeup,2rqi2w,sarkata,3,Fri Jan 9 00:10:43 2015 UTC,"I discovered the brand Eye of Horus and fell in love.   I got this Halloween special pack which included mascara, liquid eyeliner and kohl pencil and some other bits and pieces and seriously, you guys. Seriously. Wow."
AustralianMakeup,2rqi2w,Tickle_Me_Tortoise,2,Fri Jan 9 04:32:15 2015 UTC,"The products that I discovered in 2014 that instantly pop to mind as being my best finds of the year are:  Maybelline Master Precise Liner I am so glad I found this! I picked it up on a whim at Priceline 40% off sale and it is amazing! I used to use Shisedo's Fine Eyeliner but the Maybelline one is almost the same. I think it is as good as in I can get the same effect with it and bonus it costs like $50 less than the Shiseido one!  Maybelline Colour Tattoos Again picked up on a whim at the Priceline 40% sale - I now own four! I love these, they are so versatile, great colour pay off. Wear them as a base, by themselves or even over eye shadow and it looks awesome! I also love the fact that they are nearly ALWAYS on sale somewhere!  Hourglass Mineral Veil Primer Changed my life. Forever. I am so freaking oily - but no more! I seriously love this product, it's amazing I've never used anything that actually compares. I only bought the Travel size (8ml or something) as I didn't want to splash out $70 for the full size without trying it first, and I love the fact that they give you the option! I still have a fair bit of product left but I will buy the full size when I run out."
AustralianMakeup,2rqi2w,Artemisian11,2,Fri Jan 9 02:36:31 2015 UTC,I can't wait to get that sometime this year. So pricey though!
AustralianMakeup,2rqi2w,chelseanina,2,Mon Jan 12 04:24:39 2015 UTC,"The Primer? I know! But seriously go in to Mecca and it's only $25 for the small one and it's lasted me two months so far using it daily and I still have some left. But now I'm addicted, I'm going to have to buy the full size ahhh"
AustralianMakeup,2rqi2w,One_of_a_Kind,2,Mon Jan 12 04:39:33 2015 UTC,"Oh man. I bought pretty much all of my makeup last year and they're all my favourites except the naked 3 palette and some cheap revlon lipsticks. The revlon lipsticks were the only thing I bought local. The rest is international because everything drugstore is way too exensive in NZ.  First ones off of the top of my head:  The balm meet matte nude palette  Kat von d ladybird palette and the monarch palette  Chi chi lipstick in lady bump  Lorac pro2  Lorac unzipped  Stila stay all day lipstick in aria  Sleek matte me lipsticks  Wet n wild lipstick in bare it all and spiked with rum  Sugarpill eyeshadows. All of them. I like my face to be pretty colours.  Fyrinnae loose pigments. I love polar bear, gilded wings and fireside interlude. The pixy epoxy is amazing too.  Makeup geek eyeshadows. I love afterglow and insomnia. Liquid gold is great too.   Cargo waterproof blushes. These are great and blend into my skin so perfectly   Cargo lipsticks. Dubai is my favourite nude. I also have paris and damn, its pretty darn gorgeous.  Milani eyeshadow primer. I have lorac, urban decay, cargo and too faced eyeshadow primers but i like the milani one over all of them... Plus its cheaper and I can get it here without having to sell my soul and firstborn child.  I got gifted lucas paw paw treatment and i adore the stuff for my lips. I now get what all the hype was.  Rimmel stay matte powder. Dis is the good shit.  Jordanna brow powder. I bought dipbrow thinking it would be an upgrade to my old sleek brow kit but ended up hating it because it's such a hassle to use and easy to fuck up. Turns out I get a makeup boner over $2 powders for my brows instead of higher end.  Nyx blush in dusty rose. This was my first blush and i still adore it after trying both lower and higher end. Its just perfect for me and ive used it pretty much every day.  Mary loumaniser from the balm. At first i hated this sparkly shimmery shit and regretted even thinking it would look good on me. Then i learned how to blend and got nicer brushes. Now we're  best friends.  Cargo 3 mascara. I got a sample and had to fullsize once it was gone. There was no choice. This stuff is the bomb.com on my eyelashes.  Hd brows bronzer. Never heard of the brand but gave it a try. Its pretty darn nice.. No streaks, not too much shimmer and not orange (bonuuus)  I also got the australis #yolo bronzer and its actually not as bad as its name. Gives me a nice glowy sunkissed look without having to go outside.  Sleek lipsticks. Theyre all good. I cant think of one that doesnt perform well and theyre all gorgeous colours.   And then my mac lipsticks. Mama got a hankering for some fancier lipsticks than drugstore and hooooly shitballs. No regrets. Mac rebel 4 lifee.  I got a shit tonne more stuff but im not writing a novel today. This year is also the reason i have banned myself from using my cc and am on lowbuy until i finish some of this stuff lol."
AustralianMakeup,2rqi2w,missb00,3,Fri Jan 9 06:18:50 2015 UTC,So many amazing purchases this year! I also love my NYX dusty rose blush. Even with my higher end ones I still reach for it every day as well. I tried to project pan another blush last month and couldn't do it because I just kept wanting to use dusty rose.   What MAC lipsticks did you get? Or are there too many to list? :)
AustralianMakeup,2rqi2w,coochers,3,Fri Jan 9 10:09:09 2015 UTC,"Yes! Its the perfect colour for everything.. I adore it especially in the winter when i lose my summer tan and more pigmented blushes make me look clownish.  I got 12 lipsticks in total.. Diva, velvet teddy, mehr, kinda sexy, media, pander me, heroine, captive, russian red, rebel, twig and brave. I'm loving rebel so much. Its very close to lady bump from chi chi except its a sheen formula."
AustralianMakeup,2rqi2w,backwards01,3,Fri Jan 9 12:18:37 2015 UTC,"Such an amazing selection!! I also love plummy colours like Rebel and medium pinks like Brave. I don't actually own any MAC lipsticks though, so maybe 2015 will be my year :D"
AustralianMakeup,2rpxkg,hypothesise,5,Thu Jan 8 06:39:39 2015 UTC,"Fairly sure it is not discontinued! The rest of the collection that came out at the same time (the metallics collection) was limited, but I distinctly remember people asking about the palette, and they said that item only was permanent. Can't find a source, however :(  But! I just checked their fb and they've replied when someone asked about it - ""...we're expecting some stock to hit stores next week and a batch will be available online to purchase from this weekend. AC xo"". So I think it will be back. My guess is they've just taken it down while it's out of stock for some arbitrary reason, but it should come back up again."

AustralianMakeup,2rovhm,VelociraptorAlex,3,Thu Jan 8 03:57:05 2015 UTC,"Just using it as a face highlighter would be impossible to get through. It was really nice to apply as a body shimmer though. Weird tip, but putting some bronzer into it and putting it on my body as a weird daily tan thing when you were outdoors and it was too hot to wear stockings (or you just didn't want to) or you just wanted a bit of extra glow. Worked really well.  It also smelt like marshmallow fluff. Which was a win."

AustralianMakeup,2rovhm,VelociraptorAlex,6,Thu Jan 8 11:14:02 2015 UTC,Haven't confirmed by matching ingredients but W7 primer seems to be the same as the Arbonne primer! I'm about to test the Arbonne today as a trial run after using the W7 for 6 months. Will report back with results.
AustralianMakeup,2rovhm,eihpos,2,Thu Jan 8 03:33:25 2015 UTC,I'd love to know the results of this so please update! I've borrowed the Arbonne one from a friend and it's amazing but I can't bring myself to spend so much on it.
AustralianMakeup,2rovhm,dinkykate,1 point,Thu Jan 8 04:11:32 2015 UTC,"Sorry about taking so long but I wanted to give it a few days to confirm the results. WHICH ARE AMAZING! I am really really happy with this foundation, especially because I have been experiencing random bouts of hives on my face from an allergy, but this foundation got my skin looking pretty good! That said, my face cleared up the past 2 days so using it on my normal (which is quite dry) skin also was great.  The liquid is thinner than what I'm used to (Revlon Colourstay) and found it's really easy to build up coverage. It stays on my face all day and I used it with W7 primer (the dupe for Arbonne primer).   I'm really glad this worked for me. I have dry dry cheeks and combo t zone, and have been looking for a new foundation. I highly recommend it!"

Savvy Classic Blush in ""Rose"" > Urban Decay Flushed palette (Literally exactly the same, and I loooooove my Savvy blushes.  They're only $5!)  Essence ""I Love Extreme Crazy Volume Mascara"" > Benefit ""They're Real"" (I hate They're Real.  HATE IT.  & the Essence one is only $5.70!)  MAC ""Satin Taupe"" > NYX ""Mocha"" (They look different when you first apply them, but then you add colours & blend and holy gosh they're almost IDENTICAL.  Although the MAC one is better quality and less powdery, the colours are so similar I'm not even sure if it's worth the extra money for the MAC one!)  I also used some other shadows & some other stuff but I can't remember them! Whoops.  EDIT:  Also, Face of Australia ""O'Peachy"" & Savvy ""Plumage"" (LE) > Nars ""Orgasm"" (Although I haven't tried it, I've heard these are similar! I also have a Victoria's Secret blush that's pretty similar to the FoA & Savvy ones too!)  Maybelline ""Fit Me"" Concealer > NARS ""Creamy"" Concealer (Haven't tried the NARS, but I've used 2 tubes of the Fit Me one and loooove it.  So worth the $16.95 or whatever price it is!)  Australis ""Diva"" > MAC ""Ruby Woo"" (If I can get a dupe, I will.  & I loooove Australis lipsticks!)  Chi Chi ""Fashion Police"" > MAC ""Impassioned"" (Again, a cheap dupe, but Chi Chi lipsticks are amazing, and you should jump on 'em)  EDIT 2: (Though of more, sorry!)  Chi Chi ""Naturals""(?) Palette > Urban Decay ""Naked 1"" (Chi Chi are amazing, although I don't have this particular palette)  BYS ""Nude 1"" and ""Nude 2"" > Urban Decay ""Naked 1"" and ""Naked 2"" (Again, haven't used these but have heard really good things about the BYS ones!)"
AustralianMakeup,2rovhm,jamballdonut,2,Thu Jan 8 08:28:50 2015 UTC,The chi chi naked 1 dupe is the Nudes palette and I'd say all but the gold shade are near dead on dupes.

AustralianMakeup,2rovhm,jamballdonut,1 point,Thu Jan 8 12:12:47 2015 UTC,You know what else is good by Savvy? Their pressed mineral powder! Really great for lazy makeup days when you just want to swipe something on for a bit of polish.
AustralianMakeup,2rovhm,BBQsauceBel,1 point,Fri Jan 9 06:41:01 2015 UTC,"Ohhh, I use their normal face powder as my contour, so I don't even doubt that the mineral ones are amazing too!"
AustralianMakeup,2rovhm,jamballdonut,1 point,Fri Jan 9 08:09:56 2015 UTC,"I own both O'Peachy and Orgasm; unfortunately, not a dupe. The FOA blush is a glitterbomb by comparison, same colour family, but not a match."

AustralianMakeup,2rovhm,jamballdonut,1 point,Fri Jan 9 08:40:10 2015 UTC,ELF hd blush in Candid Coral is a great dupe for NARS orgasm. It doesn't last anywhere near as long though. Still lovely.
AustralianMakeup,2rovhm,panda_bear88,0,Thu Jan 8 06:13:10 2015 UTC,Rimmel's Kiss of Life for MAC's Russian Red!
AustralianMakeup,2rovhm,LordeBaldemort,-7,Thu Jan 8 02:45:01 2015 UTC,"Hahahaha, pretty much anything indie, in terms of blush, eyeshadow or lipstick."
AustralianMakeup,2ro76o,panda_bear88,11,Wed Jan 7 21:41:05 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah that's just not lilac by any definition of the term, it seems closer to fuchsia in the pictures.  I think you should email them because it's really not what you paid for."
AustralianMakeup,2ro76o,Flippantry,2,Wed Jan 7 22:42:39 2015 UTC,Yeah. I think I will
AustralianMakeup,2ro76o,smilingsunbeams,4,Thu Jan 8 00:53:28 2015 UTC,"I would definitely email! Your swatch and her  lips look nothing alike. Maybe it was just a mislabelled shade?   If I can go a bit OT, how is the lipstick formula? The model's aren't selling it for me, they look a bit crumbly IMHO"
AustralianMakeup,2ro76o,cherry_cocopops,3,Wed Jan 7 22:00:53 2015 UTC,I haven't put it on my lips yet but I can tell that it is really dry and leaves a pretty intense stain. It's also very hard to remove (harder than velourlips!)
AustralianMakeup,2ro76o,smilingsunbeams,2,Wed Jan 7 22:05:27 2015 UTC,"I can answer kind-of this in relation to the kiss proof matte formula, I bought a tube when it was on special at Coles. If you like a complete colour lock of no - transfer whatsoever (dries very matte, VERY dry), heavy pigment & long lasting then you'll love it absolutely. I really like this, just think it's a tad expensive tbh"
AustralianMakeup,2ro76o,cherry_cocopops,2,Fri Jan 9 09:40:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the review! I'm intrigued, but not enough to pay that price, especially when there's cheaper options around :/"
AustralianMakeup,2ro76o,smilingsunbeams,2,Fri Jan 9 11:31:26 2015 UTC,I got some other products in their 50% off boxing day sale - they definitely ARE high quality but waaaay too overpriced imo
AustralianMakeup,2ro76o,rebcart,2,Fri Jan 9 11:38:43 2015 UTC,I'd be more than happy to give you mine if you want to try it out (once I resolve the issue with the company). As I said I only swatched it on the back of my hand.
AustralianMakeup,2ro76o,jamballdonut,2,Sat Jan 10 07:54:00 2015 UTC,That's really nice of you but that colour would look ridiculously terrible on me. Way too pink for my dark skin :) but thank you so much for the offer!
AustralianMakeup,2ro76o,jamballdonut,5,Sat Jan 10 08:52:54 2015 UTC,"Hahah, I got 32 as well as a couple of other things because of that post too! I'll have access to a decent camera only in two weeks to do swatches though..."
AustralianMakeup,2ro76o,jamballdonut,2,Wed Jan 7 23:37:30 2015 UTC,It's so pretty. I'm glad I got it.
AustralianMakeup,2ro76o,jamballdonut,4,Thu Jan 8 00:52:59 2015 UTC,"I'd love to be updated once/if they reply.  I'm always hesitant to buy online, until I know how their CS is in case of a problem! :)  (Hoping for you sake that it's good though!)"
AustralianMakeup,2ro76o,jamballdonut,5,Sat Jan 10 06:53:37 2015 UTC,"They responded to my initial inquiry with ""removed""  I sent an email back saying I was not confused in any way and I looked at both the image and the colour descriptions provided. Then requested a refund based on the item being significantly different from the sample image/description provided. I haven't heard back yet."
AustralianMakeup,2ro76o,smilingsunbeams,3,Sat Jan 10 07:28:20 2015 UTC,"Well, at least they admitted the colour on the website is wrong, but what a dumb thing to do.  I mean, I understand there's always going to be minor differences (Lighting, editing, screen differences, etc) but THAT big of a difference? I don't see why they don't change their picture for it or something."
AustralianMakeup,2ro76o,Ienjoylongwalks,7,Sat Jan 10 07:45:55 2015 UTC,I felt like their response was quite condescending. To me it read like they thought it was my fault for believing that their images would somewhat represent the colour of the products. I honestly don't know why they didn't offer a refund immediately since they admitted fault.
AustralianMakeup,2ro76o,missbo,7,Sat Jan 10 07:52:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, actually reading back over it that's what felt sort of ""off"" for me.  I assume they didn't offer it because they don't want to give you back your money, & I reckon now you're going to have a SUPER delayed response (Possibly.  I could be wrong.  But, it wouldn't surprise me if they put off replying to you for over a week or something in the hopes that you change your mind or forget or something.)  EDIT   we can confidently say that our original image represented the colour properly   Ok, cool   We understand how this image would have confused you  in fact, not what the original looks like.   Wait, what? Okay, good job contradicting yourself?? You've just admitted that it's not the same colour, to go on to say that it represents the colour?? what??"
AustralianMakeup,2ro76o,smilingsunbeams,2,Sat Jan 10 08:06:35 2015 UTC,"I know right? Those were the exact phrases that stood out to me.  I'll let you know if they respond. At this point, this customer service experience has been far from enjoyable."
AustralianMakeup,2ro76o,smilingsunbeams,3,Sat Jan 10 08:17:05 2015 UTC,"Please do! I'm really curious to know what they're going to say next.  Maybe some more passive-aggressive sounding ""uugghhh fine ok if we HAVE to, we will, but just ps it's totally YOUR fault ok? ok thanks bye"""
AustralianMakeup,2ro76o,icicle_,2,Sat Jan 10 08:28:24 2015 UTC,"So I actually called them. They said I would have to pay for returning it to them to get a refund, which did not agree with because it will cost $8 (I paid $15 for) which means I would only get back $7. Alternatively I could choose to select another item from their Kiss Proof line, but I don't want to select another one to just be disappointed again. I'll most likely be contacting the ACCC."

AustralianMakeup,2rmlsp,panda_bear88,2,Wed Jan 7 21:31:39 2015 UTC,"Weird. I have a mini, but it looks like the ones you linked in your OP (like a test tube). I did get mine directly from Sephora in the US though. I hate the packaging because you can't stand it up!"
AustralianMakeup,2rmlsp,panda_bear88,1 point,Wed Jan 7 21:43:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah at first I thought it was a mini but it's 5mL, same size as the full.   I didn't think about that actually! I was more thinking for fitting it into a bag, the thinner size would be more convenient. Also do you mind if I ask, does yours smell very chemically? Almost like nail polish?"
AustralianMakeup,2rmlsp,petiteaustralienne,2,Wed Jan 7 21:52:31 2015 UTC,"Yes it does smell quite a bit, but I find the smell goes away fairly quickly. I wonder if there is a formula difference between the two?"

AustralianMakeup,2rkre0,missb00,4,Wed Jan 7 03:26:16 2015 UTC,"I wet a cotton ball/pad with it and wipe. I use it in the morning when I get up to get rid of any dirt or oil from overnight and freshen my face up for makeup. I also use it at night to get the last of my eye makeup/mascara/liner etc that my face wipe didn't get (or I use it in place of face wipes if I'm out of them) or on a cotton bud to clean up liner or something.  I decant it into a pump like this so I have better control over how much product goes onto the pad, squirting from the bottle usually wets the pad too much and it gets in my eyes.  https://www.priceline.com.au/cosmetics/cosmetic-accessories/cosmetic-bags-and-cases/pump-bottle-130.0-ml"

AustralianMakeup,2rkre0,BBQsauceBel,3,Fri Jan 9 06:42:54 2015 UTC,"I use it more as something to breakdown my makeup then a cleanser, hence my method using both sides of the cotton pad.  I pour some onto a cotton pad, wipe my face with it to get the water all over my face. Then I'll use the other side of the cotton pad (without any more of the water) and wipe my face again to pickup all of the makeup that's broken down. I'll repeat if I've worn a lot that day and then go cleanse my face, or at least rinse when lazy.  You'd be surprised how much makeup is picked up on the other side of the pad.  It says you don't have to cleanse afterwards but I'm just really wary of my acne coming back so want to get all of my makeup off and my face as clean as possible."
AustralianMakeup,2rkre0,seenoright,2,Wed Jan 7 04:59:59 2015 UTC,"This is what I do as well. Soak a cotton pad, use both sides to remove makeup, then cleanse and moisturise. I agree about the cotton pad picking up a lot of makeup even on the other side and being worried it still hasn't quite gotten everything off!"
AustralianMakeup,2rkre0,chocolatespeckle,1 point,Wed Jan 7 11:33:42 2015 UTC,I would totally cleanse afterward too. Loving my current cleanser and I'd feel icky about any residue left on my face.

My fears that I'd killed it by leaving it in the hot boot all day were not realised, thank goodness."
AustralianMakeup,2rkre0,Tickle_Me_Tortoise,2,Fri Jan 9 08:05:41 2015 UTC,I found that for me it stung big time when I used it around my eyes. The thought of getting in there with a cotton tip made me pucker slightly. My eyes are stupid sensitive though.

AustralianMakeup,2rm32v,alyss0r,9,Wed Jan 7 09:03:56 2015 UTC,"They should do, I've got a few little sample pots of a few shades and formula's I've been meaning to try that I had requested from them.  Most of the counters in MYER and DJ's are happy to provide foundation samples (the only one that was begrudging about it was Laura Mercier).    If not, bring your own little sample pot and ask if they'll let you take some of a tester with you, just tell them you want to see it applied in natural light, many of them sympathise that the store lighting is shocking!  (I've actually gotten samples of foundations from Priceline by bringing my own little pot, SA's are pretty happy to oblige)   As for other samples, it can really depend, it seems many stores will practically throw skin care samples at you.  Benefit sometimes has some pretty cool little samples if you ask.  Also, I'm not proud of it but I was looking for some foundation help at a Mecca Maxima and couldn't, for the life of me, get any service.  I did notice they seem to have their sample pots at their little station so I grabbed a couple to get some NARS foundation and illuminator samples (don't they say it's better to ask for forgiveness than ask permission? ;)"
AustralianMakeup,2rm32v,Flippantry,1 point,Wed Jan 7 10:43:46 2015 UTC,"Ooh, I can bring my own pots? I bought a bunch of little containers off of ebay recently. And I can get samples from pricelines?! This is a dream come true.   Thanks so much for this lil gem of info!"
AustralianMakeup,2rm32v,Flippantry,5,Wed Jan 7 10:45:50 2015 UTC,Yeah certainly!  At MAC I found they tend to take control because they don't want to give you too much of a sample but some other places are a bit more of a help-yourself-attitude (although I try to be cool about this as to not ruin it for anyone else).   I think bringing your own pots in the coolest because even foundations at Priceline aren't always that cheap to buy :(
AustralianMakeup,2rm32v,Flippantry,1 point,Wed Jan 7 10:48:36 2015 UTC,Awesome!  Also this is a secondary question but do you sanitise your pots first/how do you do it?
AustralianMakeup,2rm32v,breviloquent-,2,Wed Jan 7 10:52:44 2015 UTC,"If you've just bought them and want to be safe, just a spritz with some alcohol will be fine (then let it dry), if I'm re-using then yeah, I'll wash it out as thoroughly as I can. I usually use an antibacterial soap but I might use some alcohol too because sometime it helps get rid of any residue from previous makeup :)   If you're a bit worried about the hygiene of the tester you're grabbing a sample from, usually I might squirt a tiny bit out of the end into one of the tissues, just to get rid of any clogged/contaminated/old foundation out of the pump (usually they're in pumps in priceline anyway so not too much issue there) and then stock up :D   Wow sorry for that wall of text, I should start a novella on foundation samples!"

AustralianMakeup,2rm32v,chocolatespeckle,1 point,Wed Jan 7 23:10:15 2015 UTC,"Just a heads up, that's only 60% alcohol. It's a bit lower than I'd recommend for sanitisation (80% v/v is recommended) and pretty poor value."

AustralianMakeup,2rm32v,_HappyG_,2,Wed Jan 7 12:00:26 2015 UTC,"I use Isocol which I got from Chemist Warehouse but you can also find it at Priceline, Woolworths and Coles. It's just 100% Isopropyl alcohol like the one from Bunnings but I've never seen it in the spray bottle version that they have on their website. At about $10 for 345ml though it's very cheap and you can easily pick up a spray bottle for a couple of dollars from the supermarket or dollar store. :)"
AustralianMakeup,2rm32v,missbo,1 point,Wed Jan 7 13:23:41 2015 UTC,Isocol rubbing alcohol (the one in the regular bottle) is actually only 60% alcohol.   I would recommend buying 100% from Bunnings or Big W and diluting it to 80%.
AustralianMakeup,2rm32v,nailgirlblog,1 point,Thu Jan 8 09:33:38 2015 UTC,"Oh no, I always thought all their products were 100%, but it seems only the spray bottle they sell is. Sorry about that!   Yes it would be best to get the 100% and dilute it down. Especially since 60% seems to be the minimum for sanitising and it'll evaporate too... It's quite difficult for me to get to my nearest Bunnings though, so it's hard for me to get my hands on the 100%. That's why I was so pleased when I found the Isocol.

AustralianMakeup,2rm32v,weirdhotalien,5,Fri Jan 9 01:53:59 2015 UTC,I don't know any counter that wouldn't give samples. If they don't then walk away and screw them.
AustralianMakeup,2rm32v,nailgirlblog,1 point,Fri Jan 9 03:15:01 2015 UTC,Ahh this is so relieving to hear. I'm relatively new to the world of makeup outside of priceline and woolworths and it's scary and beautiful

Oh well at least she matched me to the color that I impulse-purchased online a few days ago..."
AustralianMakeup,2rm32v,SEXPILUS,1 point,Wed Jan 7 09:34:36 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit iffy with letting SAs colour match me because I feel like there's more pressure to buy the product then and there.   It's much more pleasant being able to take it home, see how it applies and test it in all different lighting.   But hey, good thing you ordered the right shade by luck :D"
AustralianMakeup,2rm32v,_HappyG_,2,Wed Jan 7 18:52:53 2015 UTC,"I totally get what you mean about SAs! Yeah, I was hoping to do that too. I frankly wasn't too impressed with how it looked by the time I got home but I chalked it up to the fact that my face wasn't freshly prepped before application (I was kind of sweaty and oily already) and that she applied it with a paddle brush."
AustralianMakeup,2rjvlh,panda_bear88,6,Tue Jan 6 20:50:44 2015 UTC,Probably the Swisspers branded ones! About $2 or so IIRC?
AustralianMakeup,2rjvlh,Jessijames,2,Tue Jan 6 21:33:03 2015 UTC,Do they come in a small packet? I don't want to carry anything too bulky because I don't carry a large bag.
AustralianMakeup,2rjvlh,Jessijames,3,Tue Jan 6 21:47:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I am fairly sure it's probably <1cm thick, maybe slightly larger then a credit card. $0.89 actually because 40% off!  https://www.priceline.com.au/skincare/face-care/facial-wipes/cucumber-cleansing-facial-travel-wipes-5.0-pack"
AustralianMakeup,2rjvlh,Jessijames,2,Tue Jan 6 22:02:17 2015 UTC,Looks like the perfect size. I'll definitely check them out today.
AustralianMakeup,2rjvlh,One_of_a_Kind,3,Tue Jan 6 22:16:15 2015 UTC,Just went and bought my local priceline out of these....6 packs later -.-
AustralianMakeup,2rjvlh,missbo,2,Wed Jan 7 02:29:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I just went and grabbed 2 packs. I'll see how they go."
AustralianMakeup,2rjvlh,rainbowplethora,6,Wed Jan 7 03:24:35 2015 UTC,Can you just put a couple of your normal makeup remover wipes in a zip-lock bag?  I usually keep around a nearly empty bag of wipes for travel. It's good.
AustralianMakeup,2rjvlh,wyldrose,3,Tue Jan 6 22:12:34 2015 UTC,I actually don't use remover wipes at home. I use the Clinique take the day off balm ( a huge solid tub). But I might buy some and do this anyway.
AustralianMakeup,2rjvlh,Blessed1116,6,Tue Jan 6 22:17:55 2015 UTC,I'm not sure if this is still around anymore but try and find some pre soaked in cleanser cotton tips.
AustralianMakeup,2rjvlh,Blessed1116,1 point,Tue Jan 6 22:04:16 2015 UTC,Oh that's a good idea. Then I can also use them for cleaning up my liner/mascara if it smudges
AustralianMakeup,2rjvlh,annimus_prime,2,Tue Jan 6 22:16:55 2015 UTC,"I bought and wore my first VelourLips the other day and had this same problem. I have been looking for a perfect container to carry around 3 or 4 cotton buds, which I would soak in my micellar water before leaving. I was thinking of an empty (and cleaned) lipstick tube? Or maybe a painkiller bottle? I'm still working on it because obviously it would have to be watertight..."
AustralianMakeup,2rjvlh,_HappyG_,3,Mon Jan 12 13:16:40 2015 UTC,Just get whatever size of watertight container you want and add some cotton pads soaked in your remover of choice. You can cut the pads up to make them fit the container. I just use my regular cleansing oil because I seem to be crazy allergic to all the wipes you can buy.
AustralianMakeup,2rjvlh,MsMacquarie,2,Tue Jan 6 21:36:52 2015 UTC,That's a good idea since I can then use whatever brand I want but I'm worried it might be too bulky.
AustralianMakeup,2rjvlh,peggy_carter,3,Tue Jan 6 21:49:22 2015 UTC,Considered KFC wipes?
AustralianMakeup,2rhu8j,redtonks,3,Tue Jan 6 07:53:36 2015 UTC,"Seeing this makes me realise how similar it is to the regular chocolate bar palette (seems to have a couple more mid toned browns), so I will probably pass on this one. Besides, a girl only has so many eyes and I have way to many palettes already!  Edit: also it looks great on you :D"
AustralianMakeup,2rhu8j,panda_bear88,2,Tue Jan 6 08:47:32 2015 UTC,"I think I only want it because of the blueberry shade which in most reviews is a fail :-( I can probably dupe it with an inglot shade anyway!   The rest of the palette leans too warm/red/orange browns for my colouring too I think, but somehow despite logic, I STILL WANT IT!"
AustralianMakeup,2rhu8j,Jessijames,1 point,Tue Jan 6 08:50:54 2015 UTC,I want it because I just love Too Faced. It's seriously one of my favourite brands out there!
AustralianMakeup,2rhu8j,panda_bear88,1 point,Tue Jan 6 08:53:52 2015 UTC,I am finding that lately too! I've been trying new things from them and so far I've not been disappointed! Really enjoying their products and an ridiculously excited for the new melted shades holy cow!
AustralianMakeup,2rhu8j,Jessijames,1 point,Tue Jan 6 09:56:05 2015 UTC,"The melted lipsticks are one of my favorites, hands down. Coral is a HG for me, and I'm really hoping to get a few more shades to try out. Still bummed peony didn't sort out. :| I wanna try Ruby and Fig especially."
AustralianMakeup,2rhu8j,Jessijames,1 point,Thu Jan 8 00:30:26 2015 UTC,"I have ruby fig and coal. I was so disappointed im coral myself, it is a nice shade but on me it is just plain orange with no coral tones in sight! I do really like ruby though, but fig is my favourite. It pulls a deep plum on me but it's gorgeous!"
AustralianMakeup,2rhu8j,Jessijames,1 point,Thu Jan 8 00:59:59 2015 UTC,"See, I like their coral because it's a true coral -orange pink not pink orange. Obviously not the most flattering color for everyone but it looks great on me. It would not work for every skin tone though. I'm already mourning the idea of running out lol."
AustralianMakeup,2rhu8j,Jessijames,1 point,Thu Jan 8 03:39:53 2015 UTC,"Aww! You're still lucky as there is zero hint of pink in it on my skintone :( If there was I would love it haha All the promo shots and swatches I looked at made it look as though it leaned pink but when I got it it just didn't for me at all. As an orange it's lovely, but I don't wear bright oranges all that often so it's a bit of a waste for me. I'm glad you do love it though!"
AustralianMakeup,2rhu8j,Jessijames,1 point,Thu Jan 8 03:52:43 2015 UTC,"I have to say, I didn't think the blueberry shade was that bad. It was easily quite buildable, and I didn't have any problems with my brush picking it up! I dunno, maybe I'm an eyeshadow bully, lol.  But having said that - yes, you could def dupe it. Have you looked at Temptalia's dupe list? I like her dupe matrix for looking up shade similarities."
AustralianMakeup,2rhu8j,Jessijames,1 point,Tue Jan 6 09:46:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, will definitely be checking temptalia soon! That's good to hear that about that shade, perhaps it varies in texture a little from batch to batch and you got a good one! I think I'll wait for Mecca to get it so I can see it in person! :-)"
AustralianMakeup,2rhu8j,Jessijames,1 point,Tue Jan 6 09:53:24 2015 UTC,"It is definitely close to the original, albiet a bit 'warmer' I feel like. I originally held back on buying the first one because I felt like there were too many light tones to make an impact on my skin, but I feel like this one hits that sweet spot.  I'll see myself out.  And thank you! :> I've been practicing to make my blending look good (I worry I don't blend enough), and neutrals, at least, are forgiving if I underblend."
AustralianMakeup,2rhu8j,jenjenl,1 point,Tue Jan 6 09:10:11 2015 UTC,"I'm still so torn as to if I reeeally need this palette!   By the way, if that's the optical blurring brush how do you find it? I've eyed it off for ages!"
AustralianMakeup,2rhu8j,Sleiphy,2,Tue Jan 6 08:39:01 2015 UTC,"I used it when doing my foundation before doing the eye makeup, and it's quite nice. The bristles are so, so soft and it blends my makeup really well. It reminds me of a more focused kabuki brush. I have a kabuki that's been my favorite for ages, but this one is very nice.   The palette - it's hard to say. The colors are really nice, and the formula is nice. I can use everything without any real kick-up/fallout. I'm C4 in the summer and something like NW20 in the winter, olive skinned, and I feel like the colors are awesome for me, even with a few of them being frost finish. Since I'm an old lady in training and all now. :P  I'm not sure how well I did with my eye look, but the colors were very nice to work with. So it probably comes down to if this set of neutrals is good for you and fills a gap."
AustralianMakeup,2rhu8j,Ienjoylongwalks,1 point,Tue Jan 6 09:01:18 2015 UTC,"The eye look looked great! I have that trouble too with pictures, it looks great in real life but in a picture it looks unblended and/or a little muddy. I love that touch of sparkle in the centre of the lid though!"
AustralianMakeup,2rh9et,whereismydragon,6,Tue Jan 6 04:09:20 2015 UTC,Have you tried Rimmel Stay Matte? I use it in translucent (I'm quite pale) overtop of my foundation and it stays.

AustralianMakeup,2rh9et,StrangeFarulf,11,Tue Jan 6 04:43:03 2015 UTC,"Voting for Australis here! I adore the Wayne Goss method for applying foundation and have extremely oily skin, so I use this both underneath and on top of my foundation and I've never had better wear from my makeup. I work in the fast food industry, so I often get hot and oily quickly, but this keeps me looking fresh for 8 hours!"

Bonus is it's cheap as chips!
AustralianMakeup,2rh9et,-Veruca-Salt-,3,Tue Jan 6 04:11:54 2015 UTC,Agreed. I wore this over my makeup on a stupidly hot and humid brisbane day where I walked a kilometre in the midday heat and my whole face was still intact by the end of the it.

I bought the powder through the US site before I got blocked. I'm hoping I don't love it too much more than the Australis so I won't be sad when it's hard to get."

AustralianMakeup,2rh9et,BBQsauceBel,1 point,Tue Jan 6 05:56:05 2015 UTC,I got the Essence pressed one and it broke in about a day :( if the loose version comes back I'll definitely give it a shot.

I rarely use it without primer, and I usually go with a black base (ELF's Black cream liner in Black). Holy balls, it is an amazing colour pay off.   Here's my New Year's Eve makeup look with the palette. I used my bronzer in the crease, had a black base -- blended that out, and put the silver shade on the lid. Lined with my ELF Cream Liner in Black (amazing for me).   The inner corner is a shimmery shade off of an old Rimmel Quad eyeshadow pack, applied wet into the inner corner.  I used the Matte Me foundation primer by Australis, as well as some moisturiser for priming, and used powder foundation (70 Revlon in Aquatouch) and bronzer as usual.   If you want something you can use for a smokey eye, without breaking the bank, I love the BYS Nude 2 Palette.   Picking up the Nude Palette tomorrow."

I pat them on the lid though, so it's a higher colour pay off. And it's usually only the shimmery colours that I use over a black base.  I also use a brown base (ELF cream liner in Coffee) for more neutral looks.   I also use a mix of the Black and Coffee for my eyebrows, which I forgot to list."
AustralianMakeup,2rel17,criti_biti,2,Mon Jan 5 15:35:02 2015 UTC,"They are quite subtle, which is part of the reason I bought it. I'm not much of a neutrals person, but on the odd occasion I need some this will be nice to have.   It'll be interesting to see how these colours come out when I bust out the full face and the good brushes and do all the blending and whatnot.

Since you are looking for a foundation match, I think it would be worth visiting the store so you can try it in person. If it turns out to be too much of a hassle, Pitt St Mall has tons of other shops and is nice to walk around in :)"

AustralianMakeup,2rdeya,TheNerdyPandas,0,Mon Jan 5 11:52:37 2015 UTC,"I think I can help here. Have you tried the Josie Maran range? It's liquid, opaque, cruelty free and vegan. It's also got a pretty nice Argan oil base so it feels amazing on the skin. I'd definitely recommend taking a look for yourself. I found mine at Mecca."
AustralianMakeup,2rdeya,Arlibie,1 point,Mon Jan 5 15:31:17 2015 UTC,Thanks for the recommendation! I haven't been to Mecca since they added Josie Maran but I'll definitely check it out :)
AustralianMakeup,2rdeya,wendy_online,3,Tue Jan 6 00:50:25 2015 UTC,"At the moment Sephora is still quite busy but not as packed as before. There is no line to get in which is good!   I think it would be worth it to browse and I'm sure you would be able to get colour matched.   Just a warning, I went last week and got colour matched and the sales lady said that they didn't give out foundation samples at the moment. Maybe bring a small container with you and ask if you can fill it up with some foundation?:)  Good luck! Let us know how it goes"
AustralianMakeup,2rdeya,score1fortheprincess,1 point,Mon Jan 5 06:32:40 2015 UTC,"Sweet thanks for that, I'll bring some containers"
AustralianMakeup,2rdeya,score1fortheprincess,2,Mon Jan 5 11:14:34 2015 UTC,"+1 to bringing your own little sample pot to fill, when I was there the only reason I couldn't get a sample of foundation is because they had run out of pots! If they have pots in stock, they will give you a sample though. :)"
AustralianMakeup,2rduyc,Tonkie,4,Mon Jan 5 08:15:15 2015 UTC,Crap? I wouldn't be happy with that.
AustralianMakeup,2rduyc,missbo,7,Mon Jan 5 08:26:19 2015 UTC,Oh good so it's not just me! $15 nail wraps?  Ummmm... Is it even worth going in store for?   Not to be ungrateful or anything but come on!
AustralianMakeup,2rduyc,Jessijames,4,Mon Jan 5 08:30:53 2015 UTC,"The way the email reads to me is that this is just an extra bonus, not that it is in place of the beauty loop box! If that's the case then level 3's aren't really losing anything. Why not call customer service to confirm? They would have to be really stupid to give this to the level 3's in place of a box worth far more."
AustralianMakeup,2rduyc,brucelovesyou,3,Mon Jan 5 08:31:54 2015 UTC,Yeah I don't think this is a beauty loop box. I'm pretty sure it's just an extra for level 3. I got a similar email (I'm level 2) and there's no mention of a new box. Just that they have a new gaultier nail wrap
AustralianMakeup,2rduyc,missbo,1 point,Mon Jan 5 11:06:24 2015 UTC,Yeah I wasn't sure how the email read. Because it wouldn't even compare to the boxes.

AustralianMakeup,2rduyc,megsandbacon,2,Mon Jan 5 08:59:37 2015 UTC,"If they are on top of the boxes then hey why not grab them at least, it's something for nothing! haha Realistically, from a business POV if any of their customer base is likeliest to actually drop mad cheddar on JPG it's the level 3 loopers so why not try to sweeten them up a little!"
AustralianMakeup,2rduyc,melissarina,3,Mon Jan 5 09:03:36 2015 UTC,I'm so disappointed :( what a useless item. Anyone know if it's the same for all Levels? I often ask for the level 2 one because it's better.
AustralianMakeup,2rduyc,panda_bear88,1 point,Mon Jan 5 08:31:30 2015 UTC,I didn't know you can do that! thanks :)
AustralianMakeup,2rduyc,megsandbacon,1 point,Mon Jan 5 10:30:21 2015 UTC,Level 2 boxes have been way better than level 3 boxes for ages. It kind of sucks. I didn't know you could ask for a level 2 box.
AustralianMakeup,2rduyc,jen-iscool,1 point,Mon Jan 5 22:56:09 2015 UTC,"I never even thought twice about it! I wonder if I've been doing something weird...I always just ask if they have plenty of level 2 boxes in stock, and then if they say yes I ask for that instead. The girls at Bondi and TGV in Sydney are always really nice about it and agree straight away!"
AustralianMakeup,2rduyc,Jessijames,1 point,Mon Jan 5 23:24:07 2015 UTC,Does anyone know how to get them to update your Beauty Loop online? I am on level 2 or something but it doesnt say it online but they always tell me in store.
AustralianMakeup,2rduyc,panda_bear88,1 point,Mon Jan 5 22:35:49 2015 UTC,I know with the new website they are still in the process of porting everyone's beauty loop info to their accounts on the new website. If in doubt call their customer service though! :)
AustralianMakeup,2rduyc,Jessijames,1 point,Mon Jan 5 23:50:54 2015 UTC,Went and got mine since I was already in the CBD for lunch. It's just the nail wraps. So disappointed.
AustralianMakeup,2rduyc,panda_bear88,1 point,Wed Jan 7 02:54:28 2015 UTC,"Did they tell you if it was in place of the beauty loop box? They said on their facebook page the next box isn't out until the end of Jan so I doubt this is instead of that, it's probably just extra on top of the regular box!"
AustralianMakeup,2rduyc,Jessijames,1 point,Wed Jan 7 04:50:11 2015 UTC,No they didn't say anything about the box. I went to buy too faced lip insurance btw!
AustralianMakeup,2rduyc,panda_bear88,1 point,Wed Jan 7 05:00:06 2015 UTC,Oooh sweet! I love that stuff so damn much.

Thanks for reporting back :)  Edit: ok I'm re-reading, and taking Jessijames comments into account, maybe these are bonus promo and box is later?  I'm probably not going in though, for these"
AustralianMakeup,2rduyc,panda_bear88,1 point,Wed Jan 7 06:47:07 2015 UTC,Yeah I am thinking the box will come later. Probably in the next couple of weeks. I plan on giving these nail wraps a go when I get time though.
AustralianMakeup,2rduyc,panda_bear88,1 point,Wed Jan 7 07:00:05 2015 UTC,OMG i had the worst experience with last quarter's Beauty Loop Box. I did a rant about it on Instagram and no reply from them lol...Hopefully this one will be better...! I sincerely hope these nail wraps aren't all we're getting for being level 3 >:(
AustralianMakeup,2rduyc,panda_bear88,1 point,Mon Jan 5 11:19:47 2015 UTC,Pro tip. Email their customer service. You'll get an email response and potentially a phone call too.
AustralianMakeup,2rduyc,missbo,0,Wed Jan 7 06:15:39 2015 UTC,I wonder what is in the boxes this time around. I keep having horrible luck with them so I probably won't bother picking mine up this time around. It's a massive waste of time just to receive skincare I can't use. On the plus side I've been giving all the skincare samples to my SIL so it's not being wasted. I just wish they had more cosmetic items in the beauty loop boxes.
AustralianMakeup,2rduyc,panda_bear88,1 point,Mon Jan 5 08:49:59 2015 UTC,I always think of you when there's a lot of skincare :(
AustralianMakeup,2rduyc,missbo,1 point,Mon Jan 5 09:00:13 2015 UTC,Well if there are nail wraps at least there will be something I could use. Whether I could be bothered to is the real question.

AustralianMakeup,2r9mx0,redtonks,1 point,Sun Jan 4 12:04:14 2015 UTC,"In addition to my little review of the Melted Kisses and OMFG Palette, I just wanted to say that I'm very in love with the Lancome Mascara set.  If there are any left nearby, I'd recommend nabbing it as it's pretty good value.  I'm pretty fussy with my mascaras due to having stumpy non-existent lashes but I've found the Hypnose Drama and Doll Eyes in particular work really well!  I'm also really pleased with Too Faced's Better Than Sex mascara as well and have been cycling between the three!"
AustralianMakeup,2r9mx0,fanzybellz,1 point,Sun Jan 4 03:34:14 2015 UTC,"I think I need the Melted Berry!    Damn. Shame about the eyeshadow palette. That's the shade I would have bought it for, too. Thanks for the review and swatches!"
AustralianMakeup,2r9mx0,redtonks,1 point,Sun Jan 4 03:41:49 2015 UTC,"It is really nice and applies super softly, I would definitely recommend Mellted Berry :D   Yeah the palette's a bit of a bust :( I mean it's certainly workable but it's a bit discouraging to want to reach for it if you've gone other palettes that are easier to work with :("
AustralianMakeup,2r9mx0,redtonks,1 point,Sun Jan 4 03:55:33 2015 UTC,"Peony looks so so beautiful, so unfortunate about the formula :( That being said, the other three colours are also really pretty, how do you find the wear time?  The OMFG palette is disappointing, I have a few of their other palettes and really like them. I was considering picking up the new 'matte' palette but other than the one you linked to, I haven't come across any  swatches/reviews and I can't find it in Target (maybe it's a Myer only thing?). That being said, on top of Milk the dark purple and pink look pretty nice."
AustralianMakeup,2r9mx0,sydneysomething,3,Sun Jan 4 05:30:34 2015 UTC,"I did a review on melted kisses on another subreddit, and did a wear test. All of my melted kisses plus coral wore for 5-8 hours and left a nice stain except peony, which dropped after 3. That includes meal + water and tea."
AustralianMakeup,2r9mx0,sydneysomething,1 point,Sun Jan 4 06:38:35 2015 UTC,"Depending on how you like them applied, straight from the tube they're pretty slick so they'll smudge a fair bit on food and whatnot however they tend to fade quite gradually really and if you didn't take it with you on your day, you could still have a pretty good look with the left over stain.   I think they're slightly similar to the Lip Tars in that depending on how you blot them, they can get pretty matte which will help their longevity for sure.  Because they're somewhat in between, they're not drying either which is a great bonus!   It's possible that I may have gotten a dud I guess, the original posters swatches looked so lovely and a user above mentioned her orange and yellows are really nice.  Yeah I also couldn't find it in my local Target, I visited the Myer in the CBD here (Adelaide) and it was actually on the opposite side to all the other palettes, in a bit of a hidden spot!   Now that I think about it, the pink was also a really great performer too and the purple wasn't too bad.  One thing I noticed about using the NYX primer is that one of the yellows actually turned to a more chartreuse colour (which I kinda dig!), sorry for waffling on!"
AustralianMakeup,2r9mx0,jamballdonut,1 point,Sun Jan 4 05:40:08 2015 UTC,just thought i'd say i wish that you had swatched them in the same order so i could have compared them more easily but thanks for swatching!
AustralianMakeup,2r9mx0,_actually_no,2,Sun Jan 4 05:32:32 2015 UTC,"DERP, I just realised that I'd laid them out in a different order, sorry!  The swatches do match up to the boxed order though if you wanted to use that as a reference :)"
AustralianMakeup,2r9mx0,_actually_no,1 point,Sun Jan 4 05:34:44 2015 UTC,The melted kisses and coral I got we're all a really great formula except peony. It's like the batch was bad - different and the color drops off crazy fast. I think there's something wrong with the peony ones.
AustralianMakeup,2rain3,makeup_lady,6,Sun Jan 4 10:34:55 2015 UTC,"I am loving my Urban Decay Naked Skin foundation at the moment, it's too dark for me in winter by a touch, so now that I am getting a little more colour from Summer sun it's a great match! Also, NARS creamy concealer, and also my newest MAC lipstick addition 'Faux' - I've worn it every day since I got it! :)"

The lightest shade is definitely too dark for me, but when I combine it with the new formulation of the Life's Entropy White Foundation Elixir,  it is amazing.  I love the natural and slightly sheerer coverage, I have dry skin so a lot of foundations look caked on no matter how well I blend."
AustralianMakeup,2rain3,_HappyG_,2,Mon Jan 5 23:33:48 2015 UTC,I love how it goes on so lightly and is still buildable for me! I only have shade 1.0 which is good when I have colour so I'll be getting 0.5 before winter rolls around for sure! :)
AustralianMakeup,2rain3,Jessijames,1 point,Mon Jan 5 23:52:04 2015 UTC,"0.5 is cool toned, so it isn't actually lighter than 1.0, just more peachy/pink toned. I'm very cool toned and 0.5 makes me look like an oompa loompa so I have to blend right down to my chest where I have some lightly tanned skin haha (and if you see a before and after it's pretty obvious that it is too dark for me)."

I need it! haha  I'm interested in the new lighter shades, and I'm hoping the concealer will run lighter than my current (MAC Pro Longwear Concealer NW15)  because I desperately need something that is fair enough and won't crease, adding a white foundation mixture sheers out concealers and makes them crease like a biatch so I have to conceal under foundation and hope it doesn't show."

AustralianMakeup,2rain3,Esoterria,3,Mon Jan 5 07:43:04 2015 UTC,I've been loving Maybelline's fit me concealer for spot concealing. I wanted to buy the Nars Creamy concealer in Chantilly but it is always out of stock. I think it turned out better that the Nars concealer because it doesn't look cakey but also conceals well.

Also I'm loving my MAC Next To Skin Blush as a contour,  it creates the perfect cool shadow, and I find its easier to control than Taupe, it is very fair and would probably look ashy on darker skintones, but for me it is this gorgeous and subtle matte contour shade. It was LE part of that Camo themed line (sorry I can't recall the name).  One I'm on the fence about is my TonyMoly CatChu Wink Lip Tint, I have Red and Cherry Pink which look the same in the bottle but different on the lips, I wanted to try out gradient lips, but it is very colourful and my lips are pigmented so they amp it up; I'm going to have to whip out the concealer and give it another go :/ (but it is still beautiful and deep all over the lips)  As for fail, my Fierce Magenta lipstick has tuned lumpy after a few months, the owner said it was an issue with the butters, but she also stated that vitamin E and Tea Tree Oil were the preservatives she uses hint: they're not preservatives at all so I'm pretty concerned that she gave me inaccurate information. You can see her reply here and make your own judgement."

I have been totally not enjoying the Mario Badescu skincare I was trying which focused so strongly on drying out acne that it dried out my whole face and made it super achey and sensitive and a nightmare to put makeup on top of, and my My Beauty Addiction hd lip paint in Breathless which is one of my favourite lipsticks in the world - it's seriously unfathomably beautiful - but has broken completely in the tube.

Also, a continuous favourite would definitely be my Lorac Pro palette.  I received a MAC palette for Christmas that worked amazingly the first time, but terribly the second & third time, so used my Lorac Pro (w/ the same brushes, so can't be their fault) and completely transformed my eye look from terrible to wonderful.

AustralianMakeup,2r6edl,missbo,5,Sat Jan 3 09:05:14 2015 UTC,39$ for the gel and dip brow etc is consistent for Australian RRP. People are crazy to pay those prices though.

AustralianMakeup,2r71p7,peggy_carter,2,Sat Jan 3 14:45:27 2015 UTC,I have zero experience with cream blushes so powder is probably the way to go :)
AustralianMakeup,2r6ys5,shortbrunettee,3,Sat Jan 3 09:55:43 2015 UTC,Have you tried setting the liner with black eyeshadow? Alternatively I would recommend trying the master precise liquid liner. It is my low end HG eyeliner.
AustralianMakeup,2r6ys5,panda_bear88,2,Sat Jan 3 10:11:18 2015 UTC,That sucks. Are you only putting the liner on or are you doing full eyeshadow etc. My other recommendation would be to put a bit of eye primer on your lid and maybe a touch of a skin coloured shadow as a base to help stop transfer. Otherwise I'm all out of ideas!
AustralianMakeup,2r6ys5,panda_bear88,1 point,Sat Jan 3 10:13:14 2015 UTC,"Even if I'm wearing nothing but lashes and mascara, I always put down a primer and set it then use a skin coloured eyeshadow on top."

AustralianMakeup,2r6a34,missbo,1 point,Sat Jan 3 10:38:14 2015 UTC,"Steer away from beauty therapy courses if you want to learn just makeup. Beauty therapy goes over waxing, skin, nails and makeup etc. It will only brush over makeup."

Napoleon also does an 'express' course (http://napoleonmakeupacademy.com.au/content/express) which is a bit more full on (5 days) and I imagine it could be quite pricey.."

AustralianMakeup,2r6a34,Turinqui,1 point,Sat Jan 3 06:15:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they do definitely only use Napoleon products, but obviously the techniques they teach are universal.  Another course I looked into (but didn't work with my schedule/location) was http://www.makeupschoolsydney.com.au/course-details/ - which you can do over 3 days or 3 weeks (part time). Upon completion you can obtain a statement of achievement (which means they follow a specific curriculum), again, not cheap (from what I can tell on the FAQ page it's $990) but looks pretty brand agnostic.   Hopefully someone with more experience can chime in with other options, because I wouldn't mind attending another course this year myself."
AustralianMakeup,2r6a34,MenstrualFlow,1 point,Sat Jan 3 06:43:52 2015 UTC,"I found one that looks kind of promising, just a one-day course for $200 here. Had a quick Google and they seem a decent company, not a scam or anything like that. Looks like they're MAC sponsored, but honestly I'm okay with playing around with their products. Gives some free brushes at the end, no idea what they're like.  Ultimately I have zero interest in doing beauty professionally, or blogging or anything - I just want to do me better! No clue if that kind of one is suitable for what you're looking for, but I know it suits me to a tee :)"

I don't think I will ever take it off, I am in love. I didn't swatch the Maybelline lipstain because my lips already look like the Sahara and I will probably pay for these swatches for the next few days, but totally worth it.

AustralianMakeup,2qzaxh,matthras,11,Thu Jan 1 03:47:34 2015 UTC,"Spot filler could be primer or heavy concealer.   Primer is supposed to help even out the skin and make foundation stick better but YMMV. You can get silicone based or water based ones. Make sure the base of your foundation is the same as your primer.  For pockmarks, you may need something more heavy duty like concealers from Dermacolor (Try the Kryolan store in Melb CBD - 108 Little Collins St.) or Vichy Dermablend (they have some of the line at Priceline).   Foundation can be hard to match. Assistants at the makeup counters may or may not get it right.    Get samples or whatever you think matches your face and neck and make sure to check how it looks in natural light. Give it a couple hours in case it oxidises and looks darker later. Make sure the base of your foundation is the same as your primer if you're using one. I'd recommend getting a brush or sponge to apply your foundation. It does make a difference to the finish. I'm a brush fan. People argue over the best method. YMMV.  General rules of thumb for oily skin:  choose a cream foundation for the most matte finish,   choose something with medium to full coverage for better lasting power,   get a setting powder to dust over the foundation (colourless is fine or coloured if you want extra cover), and   get a blot powder if you're concerned about shine. I can't live without my blot powder.     Tips:    Those with acne sometimes have problems with MAC foundations, so perhaps don't start with those. Their colour system is a popular way to define shades in all brands though (on blogs and in subreddits), so just bear in mind that NW shades have a pink base and NC shades are yellow. Eg - I'm between NC20 - 25. Unfortunately, whether or not a brand is at the chemist or department store or MECCA seems to have little bearing on its effectiveness. Opinions are very varied. You'll just have to try and see what you prefer. Bobbi Brown have great shades for yellower skin types. There's a makeup artist at the Melb CBD Myer called Joanne Yu who is great too - she did a full face for me once.  If you've done all this and just can't stop the oiliness from ruining your day, there are antiperspirants for the face... but there's probably no need to go into that yet...   I hope this post is useful to you. Good luck!  Edit: spelling"
AustralianMakeup,2qzaxh,billiegenius,5,Thu Jan 1 09:15:51 2015 UTC,"This is extremely helpful, especially with the name dropping!  My mother's pockmarks are pretty noticeable compared to mine, so I'm not too worried about that. If primer does the job, then great!  I'll admit that some of the prices are making me raise my eyebrows (""Wait, I'm supposed to pay ~$50 for something THAT small?!""), but nevertheless it'll be an interesting venture. Fingers crossed!"
AustralianMakeup,2qzaxh,Sleiphy,3,Thu Jan 1 10:29:32 2015 UTC,"Just a helpful hint - if you get colour matched by a counter but balk at the price or the finish doesn't work on your skin, you can use resources like findnation to find alternative products of the same colouring in cheaper brands."
AustralianMakeup,2qzaxh,billiegenius,3,Thu Jan 1 10:51:34 2015 UTC,"I daresay my balking will probably be more due to inexperience and priorities. While I can definitely shell out ~$50 on several games that'll entertain me for a long time, not knowing how much a given product will last me makes it tough for me to judge reasonably.  Nevertheless, it's good to know of places to search for alternatives. Thanks!"
AustralianMakeup,2qzaxh,_HappyG_,3,Thu Jan 1 23:10:12 2015 UTC,"No worries!   Yeah, prices be crazy especially with Australia taxes. That said, you can get a long way with samples; they can be generous depending on the sales assistant. :)   Also, don't forget that full-sized product last for ages, like 2-3 years, so as long as you choose the right thing you'll be set."
AustralianMakeup,2qzaxh,jodes,1 point,Thu Jan 1 10:51:55 2015 UTC,"2-3 years? That answers so many questions and situations I've observed but never bothered to ask about.  It definitely emphasises on the need to find products that work, so it makes sense for them to have samples available."
AustralianMakeup,2qzaxh,mcmal,4,Thu Jan 1 23:07:24 2015 UTC,"It's also important to remember that cosmetics have a shelf life, which is marked on the packet, the open jar symbol tells you how long it is safe to use after opening, and products are rarely guaranteed over 24 months. This is why many cosmetics are available in smaller quantities, because you only need a very small amount and should replace them regularly; bacteria can grow on products or they can be a cross-contamination risk if you're unwell so it's best to avoid using them if you're unwell.   So it's worth knowing which products you want to invest in, and which ones you need to replace regularly. For example, mascara should be replaced pretty regularly and there are many inexpensive options and it's usually something where you can skip a high-end option; whereas a foundation is a major part of your routine and higher end products often have longer lasting formulas and more colour range so it's something a lot of people invest in.  Setting up a collection is pricey, so most people will start with cheaper options and samples to help reduce that initial cost, don't be afraid to get samples at counters or get colour matched as these are valuable free services :)"

AustralianMakeup,2qzaxh,neodeone,7,Fri Jan 2 13:17:49 2015 UTC,I have oily skin too. You could also use a powder before any bb creams or foundation. I use the Innisfree no Sebum Mineral Pact.

AustralianMakeup,2qw1u6,breviloquent-,5,Wed Dec 31 04:45:41 2014 UTC,"OK so I didnt swatch all the MUG shades although they are beautiful but the most amazing thing is seriously the quality of the ELF shadows. I have literally told half my friends about how gorgeous and buttery it is. It surpasses my NARS duos and my Stila palettes and is as buttery as LORAC Pro. I've read reviews stating that the ""naked"" ELF palette is even better so waiting for it to come back in stock on iHerb"

AustralianMakeup,2qw1u6,redtonks,1 point,Wed Dec 31 11:02:58 2014 UTC,"I am super interested in trying some MUG shadows, I confess - I love their affordability, and it looks like their color payoff and stay time is comparable to more expensive alternatives.   How is the quality as compared to your other shadows? I actually have found MUFE to be one of my favorite formulas so far (the new ones), but if these do the same but cheaper, I'd like them, haha!"
AustralianMakeup,2qv3ik,jessislol,3,Tue Dec 30 23:25:05 2014 UTC,"If you're just looking for a powder and angled brush now there's an ecotools set available on iherb http://m.iherb.com/EcoTools-Mini-Essential-Set-3-Pieces/55068,  I was going to get that one before I was gifted the MAC keepsakes brush set, which is lovely but I think it's sold out most places now."
AustralianMakeup,2qv3ik,blitzen25,1 point,Wed Dec 31 02:55:49 2014 UTC,I honestly use my Rt brush case from the eye set and use that to carry around whatever brushes I need :) it works well because you can make it stand up alone if you have limited space for wherever you're doing your makeup

AustralianMakeup,2qv3ik,wendy_online,0,Mon Jan 5 06:58:27 2015 UTC,I bought the Japonesque mini travel brush set recently. It's a really great portable size with tidy packaging. I think the powder brush is lackluster but otherwise it's a nice product. If I was on the road I might bring that and a retractable powder brush as well.
AustralianMakeup,2qsvhp,chocolatespeckle,7,Tue Dec 30 09:20:55 2014 UTC,"I loved the price comparisons /u/Jessijames and /u/Sleiphy posted recently, but I was curious about some other brands and started comparing some Smashbox and Hourglass items for myself. In a quest to be thorough, I ended up listing every single item that Mecca stocks by those two brands, then looked into a few other brands too. I also included a theBalm comparison of David Jones and ASOS prices vs US prices. Mostly done out of curiosity, I think this'll come in handy when I’m shopping both online or in store as I always end up googling a whole bunch of things and losing track of numbers and currency conversions. I know /u/Jessijames did NARS, Too Faced and Stila recently, but I wanted it all in one table for myself (I also checked with her and she was fine with me posting this). I hope this comes in handy for some of you too!   Comparisons were done between AU and US RRP at a conversion of 1.22. Adjustments will be made if there are any major changes to the exchange rate.  Brands available at BeautyBay, ASOS or StrawberryNet have had those prices included in a column. I only included items that Mecca/DJs have listed on their websites and which are still available and listed on a brand’s own website. So no discontinued items (there were a few Smashbox ones on Mecca's site still). Mecca only stocks 6 Kevyn Aucoin products so I included a few other products that are available at BeautyBay and StrawberryNet for comparison too. I didn’t include Amazon prices for Stila and theBalm because I’ve noticed the discounts often fluctuate. Can sometimes get a good discount if you check items regularly though :)   I hope the tables make sense! Please let me know if you have any suggestions."
AustralianMakeup,2qsvhp,panda_bear88,4,Tue Dec 30 09:23:11 2014 UTC,"Just a recommendation for your spreadsheet. If you don't think RRP will change you can make a reference cell with the current exchange rate to auto update it quicker when you need it. So for example you should be able to do ""=B2* ER Cell"" instead and copy the formula down, rather than ""=B2* 1.22"" etc. That way if the ER changes dramatically you just need to change one cell (the ER referecne cell) and all the cells that use the ER for the calculations will change. You could do the same with tax for people buying in a US state where the tax may be lower to allow for a more flexible use of the spreadsheet.  Edit: Spreadsheets 4 lyf!"
AustralianMakeup,2qsvhp,panda_bear88,1 point,Tue Dec 30 10:50:37 2014 UTC,"Oh woah, of course! That's brilliant. Love that I'm also learning how to better use spreadsheets too. Thank you so much! :D"
AustralianMakeup,2qsvhp,panda_bear88,3,Tue Dec 30 11:04:37 2014 UTC,"No problem! Also remember you can click and drag down the new formula using the bottom right corner of the cell when the ""+"" appears (although you may already know that). So you don't have to do it manually for every cell! I actually teach people how to use excel and other data programs for statistical uses so if you have any questions feel free to ask/PM me."
AustralianMakeup,2qsvhp,Sleiphy,1 point,Tue Dec 30 11:11:01 2014 UTC,"Yes, thankfully I did know that! I probably would have given up if I had to do it manually for all of those! Well, I would have thought to myself that there had to be a better way and googled it lol.   I really appreciate this, thank you. I'm going to edit the sheets and do the reference cell tomorrow - I'm pretty sure I know how to do that bit. But would you be able to explain how I might use a reference cell to make the tax part more flexible? I didn't quite understand that bit, or can't imagine the possibilities with spreadsheets."
AustralianMakeup,2qsvhp,NothappyJane,1 point,Tue Dec 30 11:45:25 2014 UTC,"The best way is to enter it as a percent. Like 0.07 if the tax is 7%. Then when you use the tax in your calculation for example ""=B2* (1+Tax Cell)"". That way if tax is less than 7% you can change the tax reference cell to whatever the tax is you would be paying in the given state."
AustralianMakeup,2qsvhp,portray,1 point,Tue Dec 30 11:50:45 2014 UTC,Ahhh right! Yeah I see how that works. This is fantastic. Thank you again :)

AustralianMakeup,2qsvhp,ComingUpMilhouse,5,Wed Dec 31 05:46:53 2014 UTC,I was wrong in thinking Australia likes to rip us off. A lot of these products are only a couple of dollars cheaper in the US!
AustralianMakeup,2qsvhp,ComingUpMilhouse,5,Tue Dec 30 11:24:29 2014 UTC,That is because the Australian dollar has fallen significantly in the past 2-3 months and will most likely continue to fall for the next couple of months due to low business and consumer confidence and a lack of spending/slowing economy.   Edit: Oh I forgot. It's also due to improving conditions in the American economy!
AustralianMakeup,2qsvhp,ComingUpMilhouse,2,Tue Dec 30 11:32:42 2014 UTC,"Yeah! And with shipping cost and wait time, if you really need something these days you're not losing out much if anything to just go to your nearest DJs or Mecca. :)"

AustralianMakeup,2qt1oi,kitz_bambi,7,Tue Dec 30 11:08:31 2014 UTC,"Ooh I'll go!  Please bear in mind my face depends how I am feeling so  there are some lazy days, My routine is about 10 minutes.  FACE Lazy day: NARS Radiance enhancing primer, NARS tinted moisturiser in Groenland. Both applied with fingers!    Less lazy/need to feel more done days: Hourglass no28  serum (pat in with finger tips)  hourglass veil fluid foundation in...ivory I think, apply squirt of product to back of hand, buff in with brush.   Considering NARS sheer Glow  foundation for next purchase, and possibly hourglass tinted moisturiser when the new packaging comes out in Australia (tube....the product is to thick to pump out of the glass bottle)  Then a powder, varies between Hourglass ambient lighting powder in Dim, Guerlain Meteorites, and NARS transluscent crystal powder (or whatever the correct name is).  Applied with big fluffy powder brush In a pressy-swirly motion.   BROWS, EYES Kevin Aucoin eyebrow pencil (love this, so precise, will probably repurchase)  mascara is currently Lancome Hypnose Drama and comb through with metal comb if needed. I have a curler but I usually forget.   I wear glasses and am shorted sighted in one eye and long in the other. Coz of this I very rarely wear eyeshadow, and play up lips instead.  If I'm going out, I will add a touch of Laura Mercier caviar stick In Rose Gold or Sugar Frost,  straight to the lid and smudge a bit with my finger.   Blush and lips  These are my play items, my favourite lip colours are HOT pink (like NARS Funny Face), Purple, like Lancome Rouge in love Violette Coquette, and Red ...there's a few...probably MAC Red with MAC cherry liner.  Sometimes if I don't feel like being high maintenance, just a gloss.  I have the Too Faced Borderline clear liner and the Lip Insuranve too, recommend both.   Blush varies too. I usually choose the lip first and work back,  no lip, something like Hourglass diffused Heat, or benefit Rockateur,  bold lip NARS madly, or Too Faced sweethearts peach beach (or..whatever the correct name is)  I gravitate to specific brands, it seems! :D"
AustralianMakeup,2qt1oi,Tonkie,2,Tue Dec 30 11:46:39 2014 UTC,"I can't recommend enough the Hourglass Skin Tint. It's definitely more of a light - medium foundation on me than a TM (but that's a good thing), looks amazing and fantastic staying power which is usually the problem I have with TMs or glowy foundations."
AustralianMakeup,2qt1oi,petiteaustralienne,2,Tue Dec 30 23:12:35 2014 UTC,"I also have the one eye short sighted/ one eye long sighted issue - eyeliner on right eye = super easy, left eye often looks like I've had a stroke forcing me to give up and go for a bold lip. Good to know I'm not alone. The struggle is real."
AustralianMakeup,2qt1oi,dark_lane,2,Wed Dec 31 01:09:00 2014 UTC,I'm kind of seeing it as a blessing in disguise...I would buy all the palettes
AustralianMakeup,2qt1oi,Tonkie,4,Wed Dec 31 08:35:31 2014 UTC,"Mine, in order of application, is:   Nivea Daily Essentials Rich Moisturising Cream, wait 10-15 mins Benefit Porefessional Primer Ben Nye Neutral Set translucent powder just on the forehead, nose and chin (where I get oily) Missha BB in #13 Nars Creamy Concealer in Vanilla for under eyes Maybelline Fit Me 15 concealer for spot concealing (not always necessary). Nars Eye Primer Etude House auto brow pencil in grey-brown, although I sometimes switch to my ABH brow powder. Maybelline Master Precise liquid Eyeliner Mascara, whatever I have on hand, since they are mostly freebies.   Eyeshadow, lip products and blush and/or bronzer change daily depending how I feel."
AustralianMakeup,2qt1oi,panda_bear88,5,Tue Dec 30 11:29:26 2014 UTC,"If I'm not going out or just doing a quick errand it's just garnier bb cream or nothing, but if it's work/uni/full day:  Natio daily defence face moisturiser SPF 50+.  Wait a couple minutes than blot off any oil with daiso oil blotting sheets.  Either face of Australia primer (purple bottle) or stila one step correct. Then press in some loreal skin perfection instant blur when/where pores are an issue.  Mix 3:1 ratio of revlon colourstay dry/norm 200 with Bourjois healthy mix 51, dab it on my face then stipple with a real techniques complexion sponge.  Tiny bit of maybelline fit me concealer in 10 right under my eyes with fingers where there's darkness/blue, then shade 15 in a triangle underneath and anywhere I want highlight, using fingers first then the sponge. Then shade 35 as a cheek contour using my fingers.  Powder under my eyes with australis ready set go loose powder and maybelline shine free loose powder/australis fresh and flawless pressed powder for the rest of the face.  Rimmel natural bronzer to warm the outer part of my face, nyx taupe blush/NYC sunny as a contour. Nyx peach blush and the lighter colours from physician's formula natural nude square/palette as blush and highlight.  For the eyes: Nyx brow powder in blonde, nyx control freak brow gel. UD naked basics' foxy as an row highlight and naked2 to deepen the eyes at the orbital/crease. Then covergirl lashblast volume waterproof mascara on curled lashes.

AustralianMakeup,2qt1oi,seenoright,2,Tue Dec 30 11:51:34 2014 UTC,Is the Face of Australia primer good?! I've heard mixed reviews.
AustralianMakeup,2qt1oi,seenoright,2,Tue Dec 30 12:01:12 2014 UTC,"It depends what you're looking for. If you want something moisturise to make makeup go on smoothly it's great. I can't really tell if it makes everything last that much better because the foundation itself is long wearing and it won't do much for pores.  I use it as a cheaper alt for the stila just because I want something really moisturising, not oily and helps makeup go on better over my skin (marks and dryer areas from acne now and then) and it does great.  Just make sure you blend it into your face well if you have sunscreen underneath to make everything absorb in, otherwise it's really thin and lightweight."
AustralianMakeup,2qt1oi,petiteaustralienne,2,Tue Dec 30 12:25:40 2014 UTC,"I agree with this! I do think it prolongs my makeup, no idea how it goes for oil control because I don't need that but as for smoothing it's great. Especially under the eyes or if you're using a 'drier' or long lasting foundation that doesn't glide on as well."
AustralianMakeup,2qt1oi,chocolatespeckle,5,Tue Dec 30 23:14:20 2014 UTC,"Here's my typical morning. All the items are linked to Chemist Warehouse, Priceline, Mecca or other aussie store site. :)   QV Gentle Cleanser Cetaphil Moisturising Lotion - the 1L bottle of this is never ending Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunscreen if I know I'll be in the sun for more than just walking to/from the bus stop and train station to work OR Smashbox Photo Finish Foundation Primer if I know it'll be a long day Maybelline Shine Free Loose Powder in Light applied with RT Powder Brush Smashbox Studio Skin in 2.1 mixed with Illamasqua Skin Base in 04 applied with a damp Beauty Blender - I have these two foundations that are both too dark and too light for me. Love both of them though, so decided to mix them to match my face. Maybelline Fit Me Concealer for undereyes, set with the Maybelline Powder above, and on any little blemishes Revlon PhotoReady Concealer for any really pesky spots, applied with RT Detailer Brush.   NYX Dusty Rose Blush is my go-to right now. Loving the colour. Maybelline Brow Drama Mascara in Dark Brown Maybelline Color Tattoo in Barely Beige is my go-to quick eyeshadow colour right now and makes me look a little more alive. Couldn't find a store link for it as it was LE, but found it recently for $5 in a bargain bin at Chemist Warehouse. MAC Lash Curler - this doesn't fit my eyes properly however, so I'll be getting either a Shu Uemura or Shiseido one soon.  Maybelline Mega Plush Mascara with Australis Multi Mega Lash Mascara layered on top to stop the Maybelline from smudging. Not loving either of these, but will use them up before I look into something else! NYX Matte Setting Spray   No eyeliner (Physician's Formula 2-in-1 Lash Boosting Eyeliner) usually because I never wake up early enough, and lip colour is usually either lip balm, a chubby stick or whatever I grab while running out of the house!  I didn't realise how many Maybelline products I'm using until I typed this out..."

For my lips it obviously depends, i am obsessed with lipstick so i have a lot of colours, but ill generally always either use a mac lip primer or the occ liptar primer and then lip liner. One of my favourite lip looks is using a deep natural/ brownish nude lipliner like illamasquas media and overdrawing slightly so my lips look nice and huge.  If i need to moisturize my lips extra ill put on a kiehls lip balm earlier on while im moisturizing because that shit is hydrating as hell!  For mascara ill generally go with UD perversion or too faced better than sex, but diorshow is always a good staple and i also dont mind the toofaced better than falsies fiberwig mascara system  but it tends to be a bit sticky and i wear false lashes a lot anyway so its not too important.

Your desk doesn't actually look too bad considering you did a full face with a detailed eye. There are still so many brushes and lipsticks and jars sitting neatly in place :P
AustralianMakeup,2qt5o2,chocolatespeckle,1 point,Thu Jan 1 01:43:01 2015 UTC,Thank you! The fyrinnae pigments stick to the pixy epoxy like glitter to glue so you can really pack on the colour and it nearly doubles the intensity of the eyeshadow.  All of the silver and clear containers are by fyrinnae and then the black ones are samples from meow cosmetics that i repotted. (I hate using anything from those tiny sample bags)  I suppose my desk doesnt look too bad. Everything  is back in its set place now though because i cant stand clutter :P
AustralianMakeup,2qt5o2,makeup_lady,6,Thu Jan 1 02:37:18 2015 UTC,So I decided to do a look with an old palette of mine that I will be using in the MUR pan that palette challenge run by /u/redtonks. CC is welcome. It is the first time I used shadow as liner. Album here
AustralianMakeup,2qt5o2,panda_bear88,2,Thu Jan 1 00:46:06 2015 UTC,Good luck panning your palette! Love the shadow as liner. How did you apply it? :)
AustralianMakeup,2qt5o2,chocolatespeckle,1 point,Thu Jan 1 01:34:49 2015 UTC,I actually used a tiny bit of the ELF lock and seal on my Zoeva winged liner brush and picked up the colour from the corner of the shadow  in the palette so it wouldn't ruin the shadow. Then I just applied it like I would apply my liner normally (I usually use the maybelline master precise liquid liner). I did have to dip back in for a bit more shadow to do the whole liner on one eye. I'm actually impressed with how it went!
AustralianMakeup,2qt5o2,panda_bear88,2,Thu Jan 1 01:49:09 2015 UTC,Oh awesome! I have some Illamasqua Sealing Gel so I should really try doing this technique with it. Or even with my NYX setting spray like /u/smilingsunbeams suggested. Would love to do some purple or gold eyeliner :)
AustralianMakeup,2qt5o2,chocolatespeckle,2,Thu Jan 1 13:16:23 2015 UTC,Which palette? Love the look :)
AustralianMakeup,2qt5o2,makeup_lady,2,Fri Jan 2 00:10:32 2015 UTC,"This one. It's fairly old. I've had it for just over a year. It's called Too Faced Loves Sephora 15 Years of Beauty Palette. Here is someone's blog post about it. I used Piano Keys, So Cal (Lid), Behind the counter (Crease) and 525 Market (liner)."
AustralianMakeup,2qt5o2,panda_bear88,1 point,Fri Jan 2 00:21:31 2015 UTC,Oh nice! Looks like a lovely palette. I should probably do a project pan too. I have around 30 eyeshadow palettes ×_×
AustralianMakeup,2qt5o2,makeup_lady,1 point,Fri Jan 2 01:29:58 2015 UTC,"The shadow as liner really works! I love brown liner, and using eyeshadow means that you can do just about any colour you like (blues, purples, you name it!) I definitely want to get my hands on some Inglot Duraline or Darling Girl Superstar Serum to mess around with liner."
AustralianMakeup,2qt5o2,_HappyG_,2,Thu Jan 1 01:25:00 2015 UTC,I actually don't have a decent brown eyeliner in my extensive eyeliner collection. I wanted to practice the shadow as liner before I try using some of my indies as liner. If you do get the Duraline or the Serum I'd love to hear your thoughts on them. I just used a tiny bit of ELF lock and seal.
AustralianMakeup,2qt5o2,panda_bear88,2,Thu Jan 1 01:51:20 2015 UTC,"The Clio brush liners and Stila Liners both do some great brown liners, I find they're pretty comparable in quality and staying power as well :)  I think I'll definitely grab some, I need to get some glitter glue as well haha (I usually just use a pigmented shadow or foil with MAC Fix+)"
AustralianMakeup,2qt5o2,_HappyG_,2,Thu Jan 1 05:23:15 2015 UTC,I'll definitely check them out. Thanks for the recs.
AustralianMakeup,2qt5o2,panda_bear88,2,Thu Jan 1 05:48:01 2015 UTC,I use NYX setting spray on my indies and it works pretty well. The longevity isn't like my Stila pen for example but it doesn't smudge and looks really foiled
AustralianMakeup,2qt5o2,smilingsunbeams,2,Thu Jan 1 05:24:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah I found longevity isn't the same to liquid liner, but I was overall impressed with how it worked out."
AustralianMakeup,2qt5o2,panda_bear88,10,Thu Jan 1 05:49:12 2015 UTC,I'm a massive hermit and super lazy so I tend to not go out for NYE but it doesn't stop me from putting on fancy makeup just for sitting at home drinking cider and playing games :D   Anyway here's my attempt at some sparkly new year makeup when the reality is that I look like this on New Years (I have a face mask on right now but I'm not going to take a photo of that because it's pretty scary looking!)
AustralianMakeup,2qt5o2,Flippantry,3,Wed Dec 31 13:10:24 2014 UTC,"Australis Grandmaster Pash on your lips? Love that one, so festive :)"
AustralianMakeup,2qt5o2,Kateus3000,2,Wed Dec 31 13:41:56 2014 UTC,"It is!  I was finally able to capture it in a bit more of it's sparkling glory but still not well enough, it's so fricken amazing!"
AustralianMakeup,2qt5o2,Flippantry,2,Wed Dec 31 13:57:17 2014 UTC,That's really pretty! I love the eye makeup :)

AustralianMakeup,2qt5o2,Flippantry,1 point,Wed Dec 31 13:54:39 2014 UTC,"You're just so effortlessly pretty, I'm super jealous. Grandmaster Pash looks great on you, actually you were the one who inspired me to get it for myself!"
AustralianMakeup,2qt5o2,_HappyG_,2,Thu Jan 1 01:20:30 2015 UTC,"Auu thank you so much :D  If it's any consolation though, it's a frustrating amount of effort (please don't ever look at my camera, you'll see a million selfies until I'm happy with just 1!).  Grandmaster Pash is great, I'm glad you grabbed one, I think the shade is so versatile too!  I previously was never into the Velourlips range until I found that one!"
AustralianMakeup,2qt5o2,Flippantry,4,Thu Jan 1 03:54:49 2015 UTC,"I did a more festive gold glitter lip during the day but I wanted to end 2014 feeling like a bombshell so I looked like this.  My eyes were done with the Kit. Cosmetics Summer Fiesta palette and the L'oreal Blackbuster liquid liner, and my lips were Kat Von D Everlasting Love liquid lipstick in Outlaw."
AustralianMakeup,2qt5o2,sarkata,5,Wed Dec 31 23:37:27 2014 UTC,"We've had a family emergency, my FMIL is in hospital and things aren't looking great (she's been in the ICU since Christmas day) so we cancelled our celebration plans and took a day to recoup after spending endless hours at her bedside over the last few days. Her favourite colour is purple so we decided to wear purple in honour of her and painted our nails purple.  I wasn't going to wear makeup for New Years but I got a new lipstick in the mail which is dark purple so I whipped up something quick.    What I'm wearing:  Face:   Stila One Step Correct Primer Koh Gen Do ""Maifanshi"" Moisture Foundation in 001 Kat Von D  Lock-It Tattoo Foundation 42 (the lightest discontinued shade, LE?) Maybelline Coverstick Corrector Concealer Yellow Australis Colour Corrector Green Ben Nye Translucent Powder BH Cosmetics Glamorous Blush Life's Entropy Particle Countour Stick Proton   Brows:   Life's Entropy Brow Pomade Dark Brown (dip brow dupe, very pigmented and a touch too dark) Daiso Clear Mascara   Eyes:   Urban Decay Primer Potion Original Maybelline Color Tattoo Painted Purple (base) I forgot to add this to the list haha Too Faced Chocolate Bar Palette (crease and outer V: Salted Caramel, Semi-Sweet, Triple Fudge, White Chocolate) Lorac Pro Palette (blending shade: Cream) Hello Waffle Snow Queen eyeshadow (lid) Hello Waffle It's A Catastrophe eyeshadow (outer V and outer crease) Femme Fatale Sugar Rush eyeshadow (centre of the lid) Lancôme Hypnose Mascara   Lips:   Life's Entropy Lipstick in Blackbody (LE)"
AustralianMakeup,2qt5o2,_HappyG_,3,Wed Dec 31 14:28:22 2014 UTC,"Hope all goes well in the family stakes. For what it's worth, that lipstick is beautiful and it's lovely on you (I was eyeing them up but resisted on Black Friday)."
AustralianMakeup,2qt5o2,sarkata,1 point,Wed Dec 31 23:39:30 2014 UTC,"Thanks /u/Sarkata, she's been on life support for a while now and kept sedated and on dialysis, but they just took her breathing tube out so we'll just have to see how it goes... There's just no way of knowing the outcome so we're trying to remain hopeful but realistic.   You should definitely try to grab the set when the store re-opens, I bought the whole set because I was super impressed with their Lip Theories and I'm loving the lipsticks so far; I've only tried two of them, but I'm already blown away. The pigmentation is awesome and they're very creamy, I didn't use a lip liner at all (or eyeliner, it was pretty rushed)."
AustralianMakeup,2qt5o2,_HappyG_,2,Thu Jan 1 00:49:46 2015 UTC,"Hoping for the best for your FMIL. The purple-themed look you did was lovely (although I may be biased because purple is also my favourite colour). Very beautiful but not over-the-top purple.  I can't wait for my Life's Entropy order! I only got my shipping notification three days ago, but I ordered some Brow Theory samples, full sizes of Supernova and Milkyway, and samples of the other three satin lipsticks. Not sure if I can pull off Blackbody, but I'm definitely thinking I need Flux and Plasma looking at everyone's swatches :) I see that you didn't use any lip liner - how did the lipstick wear? Did it feather? I'm always scared of that with dark lipsticks and no lip liner."
AustralianMakeup,2qt5o2,chocolatespeckle,1 point,Thu Jan 1 01:26:45 2015 UTC,"Thank you, she's totally obsessed with purple so we thought it would be something she'd like. I'm planning to wear something purple every day at the hospital :)  I was really excited to receive mine, I was waiting by the mailbox because I was worried they'd melt in the summer heat, I was a little disappointed that they didn't have the engraving though (I think that was due to the high demand). I'm really impressed by my brow theory, but I shouldn't have bought dark brown because it is really pigmented (I had to wipe off excess the back of my hand) and the first brow I did went into the scouse brow territory...  The lipstick didn't feather for me, but it didn't survive eating too well and wore off the inside of my lips (but it is creamy so I don't think it's designed to be long wearing), and there was some staining but nothing too major, although it stuck tomy foundation when I made a mistake, so keep that in mind if you want to avoid touching up with concealer. I could swatch them if it makes the decision any easier?"
AustralianMakeup,2qt5o2,_HappyG_,2,Thu Jan 1 01:44:44 2015 UTC,"Lol I've never tried using a pomade before, so I'm afraid I'll probably be rocking a scouse brow for a while. I usually only use a brow mascara and I'm bad even just using eyeshadow on my brows.  You're making me so excited for my order to arrive! I may also have ordered a sample set of lip theories... heh  I actually ordered samples of the other three satins, so I'll just wait for those to see how they look on me. Thank you for offering! :)"
AustralianMakeup,2qt5o2,chocolatespeckle,1 point,Thu Jan 1 13:24:05 2015 UTC,"I use a brow pencil or pen which is meant to be less pigmented to prevent overdoing it but I feel like my brows get too dark if I'm not careful, although the pomade probably matches my hair I feel like it is a bit much and I'm definitely not used to a power-brow haha, so I'm definitely considering grabbing a lighter shade or some samples,  the only issue is it isn't worth the shipping for just one item so I may just wait for the next group order.  My first order was the Lip Theory sample set and it was a total gateway drug, the whites are a bit patchy but there are some really stand-out shades!  I'd love to see how you look in them when you get them :D"
AustralianMakeup,2qt5o2,_HappyG_,2,Thu Jan 1 14:13:54 2015 UTC,"Nooouuu :(  I hope things get better, do take care of yourself and your SO in this time <3  You look lovely and purple suits you well :)  I love the Hypnose mascara too :D"

AustralianMakeup,2qt5o2,missreah,1 point,Wed Dec 31 14:33:35 2014 UTC,I like it. I think you could possibly soften the start of your brows a bit since they look darker at the start compared to the tail end (but that might just be from the lighting).  What is on your shirt? Edit: and by that I mean it looks like a cool picture.
AustralianMakeup,2qt5o2,panda_bear88,1 point,Wed Dec 31 21:17:47 2014 UTC,"Yeah i really have to lift my brow game. I havent waxxed them in ages either >. <.

AustralianMakeup,2qt5o2,Tomkhagai,5,Mon Jan 19 09:51:47 2015 UTC,"Hey friends, do people mind if I link my instagram? I'm in a bit of a rush and I want to post this and run. Link here.  I am amazed at how well this held up, I was dancing full out for a few hours at The Beat in Brisbane. I of course put glitter all over my chest, stomach and arms and was thoroughly amused when I saw sexy Beat dancers with the same glitter.   This is Kryolan TV Paint Stick which just holds up seriously well to sweat. UD's Electric palette and the Sugarpill Burning Hearts palette (my first party was bright themed). I have Lit Cosmetics Vitamin C glitter along my lashline and then I put OCC glitter in mirrorball on the lid and under eye inner corner. Lips were OCC lip tar in rollergirl and later touched up with MAC Heroine. Blush is Hourglass Mood Exposure and Sleek Guipure. Australis translucent setting powder. Lashes are by Red Cherry.   No setting spray because I always forget to use it."
AustralianMakeup,2qt5o2,chocolatespeckle,2,Thu Jan 1 03:09:21 2015 UTC,You look awesome. Love the colours and how fun your look is. I didn't even notice the captions at first that showed the photos were taken many sweaty hours apart and without setting spray too!
AustralianMakeup,2qsxae,ZombieJaybird,2,Tue Dec 30 09:50:02 2014 UTC,"I've tried their compact foundation and the long wearing one. Both were ok. Not fantastic, but nothing wrong with them. Actually matched me, which is why I had them."

AustralianMakeup,2qsxae,DarkPhoenix1993,1 point,Tue Dec 30 11:16:39 2014 UTC,"My HG foundation is their Skin Foundation!! They do pull yellow but I'm a neutralish pink and they work just fine. The coverage is light but buildable and it allows my skin to breathe. You don't need much either - one bottle lasts me for months! Plus the shades go quite pale and quite dark. The MUAs as a whole I've found quite nice. Yeah they are a bit pricey but it's worth it in my opinion. I love their whole range!  I wear this everyday, so if you'd like to see what it looks like on me I'd be happy to show you!"
AustralianMakeup,2qsxae,SoDarkTheConOfMan,1 point,Wed Dec 31 03:54:00 2014 UTC,"I just bought their stick foundation yesterday, and I wore it today, and am loving it so far! It glides on easily, even without a primer, the colour suits me perfectly, the coverage is light to medium, but yet it still looks like my skin. It's been reformulated, so apparently it's much better. I haven't tried the previous formula, but this one is good! It also stayed on all day today, so its longevity is pretty good too."
AustralianMakeup,2qsxae,spitey,1 point,Wed Dec 31 06:49:49 2014 UTC,"I use their stick foundation as my daily and I love it - goes on easily, excellent colour match and quite buildable. I do use powder to set it, so if you have oily skin you might be better suited to one of the traditional liquid foundations. :)"
AustralianMakeup,2qsxae,neodeone,1 point,Wed Jan 7 09:53:39 2015 UTC,"I've tried their bb cream and hated it, it's really grey and made my skin look lifeless and dull. Their skin foundation is nice but most of the shades pull really yellow."
AustralianMakeup,2qsxae,neodeone,1 point,Tue Dec 30 10:14:43 2014 UTC,"Huh, that's interesting about the bb cream - the few I've tried from other brands have been too tan. And most of the foundations I try are too pink or far too dark and yellow, so maybe I'll get a sample/get matched sometime and see what they're like."

AustralianMakeup,2qrtyj,sarkata,2,Tue Dec 30 03:35:42 2014 UTC,Glitterati looked so glittery! I'm sure it would be great for layering. I found that the glitter tends to stick around after most of the gloss has worn off.
AustralianMakeup,2qrtyj,Tonkie,2,Tue Dec 30 04:12:35 2014 UTC,"I love gloss, and these look amazing. heading into the city tomorrow so I might brave Myer for a look! GLITTERRRRRRRRR!!!!"

They are pretty full on with the glitter and the glitter also seems to stay around really well as the gloss wears over time. :D

AustralianMakeup,2qryuc,neodeone,0,Tue Dec 30 10:49:00 2014 UTC,"looks awesome! only cc I have is maybe blending your shadow out sideways (winged) rather than up, it would really suit your eye shape :)"
AustralianMakeup,2qryuc,_HappyG_,2,Tue Dec 30 04:02:06 2014 UTC,"Sort of more horizontally?

AustralianMakeup,2qryuc,_HappyG_,1 point,Tue Dec 30 04:55:14 2014 UTC,"I agree, having hooded eyes myself, I find it is best to blow-out the blending a bit to create a false crease a little higher. I'm also careful with placement because going too far down on the lower-lashes can make my eyes look droopy. I love these tips and I use a lot of these techniques personally; that said, just do what works for you and these tips may not suit all eye shapes."

AustralianMakeup,2qot6y,jamballdonut,1 point,Mon Dec 29 08:29:30 2014 UTC,"W: 36.5cm, D: 28cm, H: 20cm. The drawers are about 3.5cm high inside, the bottom one has a width of 32cm, and the top ones are about 9.5cm each, and they all have a depth of 18cm."
AustralianMakeup,2qot6y,wildmareep,2,Mon Dec 29 21:46:18 2014 UTC,Thanks! Going to pop in today after work and see if my local one has any.
AustralianMakeup,2qot6y,phattoes,2,Mon Dec 29 23:25:10 2014 UTC,Oh dang I was at Reject Shop today looking for dog beds and decided not to check out the other areas so now it looks like I'll have to go back tomorrow!
AustralianMakeup,2qot6y,thefinish,2,Mon Dec 29 08:54:28 2014 UTC,"Woaaah, that's pretty good value, and would actually help decrease all the drawers I have.  Guess I'm taking a trip to The Reject Shop on Wednesday!"

AustralianMakeup,2qo5fn,Jessijames,2,Mon Dec 29 02:06:56 2014 UTC,"The BE palettes were $3 each - I couldn't really resist! I have never seen them before, but my nearest priceline had a bin of these, BE mascaras, felt liners etc etc - I am tempted to go back and grab an eyeliner to two!!  The eyeshadows are definitely hit & miss - the mattes are weak performing with little pigment but aren't super chalky. The shimmers are a little better and quite soft but the metallics are full blown buttery pigmented goodness - for the price, IMO the palettes are worth it for those shades alone!"
AustralianMakeup,2qo5fn,jamballdonut,1 point,Mon Dec 29 02:09:35 2014 UTC,"I originally bought the smoky eye one & did a review on my channel, but it just turned into me ranting for 14 minutes about the lack of mattes in the palette, haha.  I also picked up the natural one, which looks like a pretty okay dupe for some shades from the Naked 3, but honestly, for $3, they're both pretty amazing! (They are while stocks last though, so all my local Priceline's have been sold out for a while now :( )"
AustralianMakeup,2qo5fn,BBQsauceBel,2,Mon Dec 29 09:30:47 2014 UTC,Thanks for the swatches! A shame that some of the shades in the palettes weren't so pigmented but $3 is a great deal.
AustralianMakeup,2qo5fn,panda_bear88,1 point,Mon Dec 29 03:44:05 2014 UTC,"No problems, they do swatch a little better with a primer but still not out of this world! :)"
AustralianMakeup,2qo5fn,panda_bear88,1 point,Mon Dec 29 03:51:57 2014 UTC,I'd love to see a look using those palettes you got when you finally have a chance to play with them. How much did they cost?
AustralianMakeup,2qo5fn,terrabellan,1 point,Mon Dec 29 02:10:50 2014 UTC,"They were $3, I was pretty impressed for the price!! & Heck yeah, I have this week off work so looks will be happening!"
AustralianMakeup,2qoomh,UndecidedUser,6,Mon Dec 29 05:24:46 2014 UTC,"I've tried their Natural Eyes palette or something (It has 4 brown shades in it) and oh my goodness, TERRIBLE.  I haven't tried any of their other products yet, but I have a review coming out soon of the palette & you literally can't see anything on my eyes.  There's no pigment, even though the shades are super smooth and soft and you can see that you've picked up colour.  It just doesn't translate to your lids.  :("
AustralianMakeup,2qoomh,jamballdonut,1 point,Mon Dec 29 09:32:27 2014 UTC,I was actually looking to buy that palette because of the shades! Thanks for letting me know though. You saved me from the disappointment.
AustralianMakeup,2qoomh,jamballdonut,1 point,Mon Dec 29 10:07:09 2014 UTC,"Haha, I'm glad! If you're looking for a similar one, I've heard the Essence Quattros are pretty good (Not sure if they even still exist, and if they have the neutral shade one though!)"
AustralianMakeup,2qoomh,jamballdonut,1 point,Mon Dec 29 10:24:34 2014 UTC,I already love so many Essence products so I'll definitely check it out. Thanks!
AustralianMakeup,2qoomh,petiteaustralienne,1 point,Mon Dec 29 11:11:42 2014 UTC,"All good! I have a few of their single eye-shadows and they're pretty decent for the price, so I imagine the Quattros would be pretty good too! :D"
AustralianMakeup,2qoomh,jamballdonut,1 point,Tue Dec 30 01:26:39 2014 UTC,"They are still around, the neutral one is awesome, can't recall the name but it's possibly something to do with coffee?"
AustralianMakeup,2qoomh,TheNerdyPandas,1 point,Mon Dec 29 22:42:09 2014 UTC,"Yeah, that sounds about right! I know Brittney Saunders used it in one of her videos ages ago, & it seemed pretty decent in that!  (I totally looked on the Priceline website and it's ""To Die For"", but I swear it was something to do with coffee too, so idk idk!)"
AustralianMakeup,2qoomh,Turinqui,3,Tue Dec 30 01:20:50 2014 UTC,"I love their primer! apparently it's a well known dupe for Benefit's porefessional, a little bit goes a long way and I love how it makes my foundation last longer."
AustralianMakeup,2qoomh,missbo,3,Mon Dec 29 07:24:57 2014 UTC,"I have their cream blush in the colour 'Divine'. I like it, it doesn't slide around my face, I'll likely pick up another colour or two next time I get to Chemist Warehouse.   Swatch (heavily applied on the bottom then sheered out on the top): http://i.imgur.com/SQ0w4Av.jpg"
AustralianMakeup,2qoomh,rainbowplethora,2,Tue Dec 30 03:24:08 2014 UTC,"I've only tried one of their matte bronzers and I really enjoy it. I was using it for over a year and never hit pan. I've just been using all my other bronzers now.   Ps, the stand at Chemist Warehouse Chadstone is massive and has testers for everything."
AustralianMakeup,2qoomh,percival__winbourne,2,Mon Dec 29 06:33:00 2014 UTC,"I have a bunch of their lipsticks and nail polishes. The polishes I would put on the same level as Sinful Colours or similar.   The lipsticks have good pigmentation/opacity. They're pretty creamy, usually. They smell nice. They don't last super long, though. I'd say for 5 bucks, they're pretty good as long as you don't need to go hours without any touchups."
AustralianMakeup,2qoomh,firsttimemidwife,2,Mon Dec 29 09:26:40 2014 UTC,"Their mascaras are fantastic, my HG mascara is their Flirty Eyes or whatever it's called, black and pinkish-purple tube - I have that thing where you have more than one row of lashes and it's the best product I've ever found for them.  I'm using their primer at the moment, it goes alright, not the best I've ever used but certainly not the worst! (Looking at you, Savvy and Australis)  I've tried their liquid eyeliner and holy cow that stuff has staying power, it's ridiculous, even using OCM I found it stubborn. I don't use it anymore because 1. It makes my eyes water and 2. Maybelline pen is my HG liner right now  I tried one of their blushes, pigment and texture seemed okay for the price but boy did I get the wrong shade for me.  Their nail polishes are also pretty great, I always have a rummage through for a new one when I find a display.   I picked up a concealer by them once but the texture was all clumpy and it seemed a bit gross so I never used it.  Overall I find I have more hits than misses with W7, but I haven't sampled their entire range. For the pricing, I don't mind having a miss every now and then because the hits more than make up for it"
AustralianMakeup,2qoomh,percival__winbourne,1 point,Tue Dec 30 00:06:12 2014 UTC,multiple rows of eyelashes sounds like the best problem ever!
AustralianMakeup,2qoomh,firsttimemidwife,2,Wed Dec 31 04:08:45 2014 UTC,"You'd think so, but it makes eyeliner pretty bloody tricky!"
AustralianMakeup,2qoomh,_HappyG_,2,Wed Dec 31 07:41:31 2014 UTC,"I feel ya, I have zero lid space so eyeliner is pointless #reallifeproblems"
AustralianMakeup,2qoomh,Lingamae,2,Wed Dec 31 07:45:47 2014 UTC,"I find their nail polishes vary wildly but they generally need multiple coats to reach opacity. The foundations run too dark and yellow for me, but for ages I used their under-eye brightener pen and it was great, it is a dupe for  high end product (I can't recall the name at this time), it does crease and is a touch sheer but is okay for the price, I actually swatched the product it dupes in-store and the colour/coverage/texture were pretty spot on, and that stuff was over $50!  I find the lipsticks overall to be hit and miss, many are sheer but they are ok for the price and they had some cool colours for Liptember such as purple. My favorite product by W7 would have to be the blushes in the oval cases, even though the case is flimsy plastic (one of mine broke) and the colour range is limited, they are super pigmented  and don't fade, you need to use very little so I'm nowhere near hitting pan after a few years (I normally don't keep makeup that long)."
AustralianMakeup,2qoomh,chocolatehistorynerd,1 point,Wed Dec 31 15:26:04 2014 UTC,"I haven't tried any but I'd really like too, especially the lightly toasted palette. Chemist Warehouse stocks their stuff? Do you know if it's all Chemist Warehouses?"

AustralianMakeup,2qoomh,dark_lane,1 point,Mon Dec 29 10:27:52 2014 UTC,Oh really? I had no idea. Thanks!
AustralianMakeup,2qoomh,Lingamae,3,Mon Dec 29 12:06:41 2014 UTC,"I have the lightly toasted palette - got it on ebay for about AUD8 including shipping from the UK.  Some of the shades are great, some are not, but for the 8 bucks it was well worth it - I use it almost every day.  I am keen to try some of their other stuff but am on a no-buy (after being on a mega-buy during the sales!)."
AustralianMakeup,2qoomh,dark_lane,2,Mon Dec 29 11:35:59 2014 UTC,"Oooh, did you post your haul from the sales? I didn't buy anything because being so new to makeup I have no idea what I want first! I'd love some good eyeshadow but I'm actually pretty crap at putting it on so blowing a decent amount in a good palette probably isn't a great idea."
AustralianMakeup,2qoomh,wanderer117,2,Mon Dec 29 12:06:15 2014 UTC,"I did a lot of online purchases, things are coming in drips and drabs so didn't bother with a haul post.  I did just re-organise my battle station and was quietly shamed about the amount I have acquired in the last few months (I get fixated on getting the ""perfect"" thing and buy heaps of the same type of item trying to find the perfect one) so I slunk over to /r/MakeupRehab…  If you don't want to drop a lot on a palette and want some things to play around with, any of the bigger W7 palettes like In the Buff In the Nude Lightly Toasted or In The Night will give you enough reasonable shades to try out before you move onto better stuff - just make sure you have a couple of decent brushes.    Edit: grammar"
AustralianMakeup,2qoomh,My_Makeup_Collection,2,Tue Dec 30 01:58:53 2014 UTC,I'm not sure if all Chemist Warehouses are stocked with W7 products but the one closest to me (Castle Hill) has a good range of their products.

AustralianMakeup,2qnq4p,NothappyJane,10,Sun Dec 28 23:38:46 2014 UTC,I'm currently loving messydownunder. I know she's pretty active in this subreddit too. I feel like she's super honest with her reviews and stuff and she's only got about 2000 subscribers so she doesn't do sponsered looks and stuff. She uploads so frequently which is good! She doesn't do a lot of tutorials more hauls and reviews etc. I also like miss Billy who is a friend of messy and also active in this subreddit!
AustralianMakeup,2qnq4p,trignometry,6,Mon Dec 29 00:03:54 2014 UTC,"I liked Messys channel. I feel like shes into the same aesthetic as I am, and I like high vs low end comparisons. Because makeup is just so hard to get at a decent price Aussies kind of need that."
AustralianMakeup,2qnq4p,trignometry,2,Mon Dec 29 00:16:36 2014 UTC,Yeah I know exactly what you mean. I find her really relatable and she uses lots of products I own or have access to!
AustralianMakeup,2qnq4p,dark_lane,2,Mon Dec 29 06:39:33 2014 UTC,"I really like Messy, she's easy to listen to; I find too many YTers have that fake overly excited high pitched voice happening that makes it a bit painful to watch. She's also really honest and doesn't do sponsored posts which is great."
AustralianMakeup,2qnq4p,missbilly,7,Wed Dec 31 01:19:53 2014 UTC,I really like Heidi Hamoud. She does some really beautiful looks that aren't TOO hard to recreate. Also love Messy of course.

I also run a YouTube channel at jamballdonut where I focus on Australian-available, affordable products, but my channel is still super dooper tiny at the moment :33"

I was just watching another YouTuber who's cupboard door was open and it was making me think I'd wish to break the 4th wall and shut the dam thing. If I wanted to look at messy cupboards I'd stick to my house or watch one of those hoarding shows on gem. Anyway, rant over. Definately consider some cheap LCD strip lighting or a lamp so we can see your looks. Otherwise, it's awesome."

We leave it open or else the sound system overheats, but I was actually thinking about that today & I'm planning on moving my camera slightly to the right so you can't see the damn cupboard!

Rachelleea is pretty good too, but tends to use the same kind of products all the time (Benefit They're Real Mascara, Beletto Studio Gel Liner, Bourjois Healthy Mix etcetc).  My all time favourite is Sharon Farrell. She's a professional makeup artist originally from Ireland and working in Sydney.

Maybe if they haven't replied by the 5th of Jan (gives them time for any Christmas/New Years break they may be on) leave them a wall post or something?"

I've had this before with some other garbage eyeliner which I must have purged from my memory as I can't remember the brand. :P

AustralianMakeup,2qeloo,Blessed1116,7,Mon Dec 29 08:52:03 2014 UTC,"To get more stickiness, first Eau de parfum has higher scent to alcohol ratio and will  last longer than Eau de toilette. With perfume you really do get what you pay for, but that's not to say you can't find something In Your budget to work for you.   Second, if you can, layer the scent- if you like the celebrity or fashion house ones look for sets with a lotion in them and apply the lotion too.  If no matching lotion, apply a non scented body cream to the places where you spray your perfume before spraying.    This next part might sound absolutely blasphemous to some people, but you can open the perfume bottle and add a few drops to a plain lotion or unscented shower gel..just be suuuuuper careful.  If you are buying from a counter ask for a sample vial, you can use this for the above without the risk of lost product.   Spray your fragrance where your body generates heat, a mist on your belly. and one on your thighs under a dress ;) ;)"
AustralianMakeup,2qeloo,Tonkie,1 point,Fri Dec 26 04:44:58 2014 UTC,"I've read that you shouldn't rub your wrists together after spraying perfume on them. You seem to know what you're talking about, so is that right?"
AustralianMakeup,2qeloo,randomisedletters,2,Fri Dec 26 10:18:27 2014 UTC,"Oh shucks! Thanks :) the reason behind this is that the action was thought to ""bruise"" the perfume, or, the scent molecules in the perfume.  I think, scientifically, this isn't really possible.  But, what the friction of rubbing the wrists together does do is generate heat, and that heat can alter the way the perfume smells on you.  Heat will also cause the perfume to evaporate more quickly so the ""top notes"" that you get when you first spray the perfume will disappear quicker no you'll get to the middle and base notes.  In turn, this means the perfume probably won't last as long on your skin.   I think this ritual comes from an older time where perfume was made/packaged differently, solid perfumes in balms for instance, and perfume oils o f great strength that were applied directly  to the skin from tiny vials.   Due to the luxury and expense, a lady would  get greater use out of her fragrance by  applying at the wrist and then daubing at the neck and other wrist too.    So, TL;DR,  I personally don't rub,  I like to spritz, and if the  part of your fragrance you love is the smell you get when you first spray it (top notes), don't rub.  If you like how rubbing your wrists together feels as part of the scent ritual, you're not really doing any harm :)   Does that make sense?"

Recently I was given a box set of perfumes from Benefit and they are now in the rotation, too! They are gorgeous and hang around for a fair bit.  My favourite celebrity one is the Victoria Beckham's Signature one (it has flowers on the bottle) it is my power-scent for work.   Edit: I've heard you're meant to keep perfume in the fridge, but I keep mine out of sunlight (in a shoe box, in a draw) and the scent is stronger and they last much longer."

AustralianMakeup,2qeloo,dallas95,2,Fri Dec 26 03:54:08 2014 UTC,I'm always a fan of really clean smelling fragrances.. I think I'm on my third or fourth bottle of Romance by Ralph Lauren.  Marc Jacobs' original perfume is great too (although it's ridiculously strong) as a nice gardenia scent. Florabotanica by Balenciaga is a nice newer one.
AustralianMakeup,2qeloo,deathcabforkatie_,2,Fri Dec 26 04:44:33 2014 UTC,My skin really likes to turn most perfumes into a smell that resembles battery acid but I usually find floral (roses mostly) and citrus perfumes wear well. Anything vanilla or musky and it smells awful.  Just found my HG perfume is the Chloe Roses perfume. It's just so dang expensive.
AustralianMakeup,2qeloo,BlissAbyss,2,Fri Dec 26 04:50:39 2014 UTC,"im the opposite! anything floral and citrus smell like sweat on me lol, is Chloe Roses long lasting on you? my mum is obsessed with anything rose scented  edit: if youre after a good citrus, try the DKNY Woman perfume, its in the long sort of square bottle, and smells like mandarins and heaven  http://www.theperfumeshop.com/pws/images/catalogue/products/1015/large/1015.jpg"

But definitely my favourite scent."
AustralianMakeup,2qeloo,BlissAbyss,2,Fri Dec 26 05:22:17 2014 UTC,"Yes! I'm also a big fan of Chloe Roses! I can't decide between that and the original Chloe EDP for my favourite.

AustralianMakeup,2qeloo,chocolatespeckle,2,Fri Dec 26 08:23:15 2014 UTC,Honestly I have had enough battery acid perfume experiences to turn me off a lot of perfumes. I like The Body Shop perfume oil in Atlas Mountain Rose for an everyday substitute which is a lot cheaper. I wish they made their Wild Rose as a perfume (it is only in a hand cream but it smells like they crushed rose petals and bottled it). I am repurchasing that hand cream as soon as I finish my other ones.   I did try the Chloe EDP...still bad on me. My roommates and I did a perfume test and I made their favourite perfumes smell terrifically awful.  I only own rose perfumes. It just works on me for some reason. Plus it is my favourite way to smell so that is lucky.
AustralianMakeup,2qeloo,BlissAbyss,2,Fri Dec 26 09:33:24 2014 UTC,I have two that I wear in rotation. Lady million and Rise by Beyoncé. I feel like they last quite a while especially lady million (I can sometimes still smell it after an epic gym session before I go for a shower)
AustralianMakeup,2qeloo,alfie1806,2,Fri Dec 26 08:29:48 2014 UTC,"I use the blue Katy Perry Royal for everyday (well mainly just for work) and I also wear Dior J'adore often as well.   I'm lusting over J'adore L'or, but it's so expensive for a small bottle. It's super concentrated which is why I think, I'm no expert. Oh it's so beautiful though. One day."
AustralianMakeup,2qeloo,Ienjoylongwalks,2,Fri Dec 26 11:41:06 2014 UTC,"Ooh, I love my Lola by Marc Jacobs. I have a limited edition one of the Oh! Lola as well. That's my jam."
AustralianMakeup,2qeloo,alyss0r,2,Fri Dec 26 11:43:45 2014 UTC,"I love Princess by Vera Wang and Angel by Theirry Mulger - I wear these most of the time. Another fave is Flowerbomb by Viktor & Rolf but it's super pricey so when my mini ran out I couldn't get another one :-/  Some celebrity faves of mine are Heat & Heat Rush by Beyoncé, Killer Queen by Katy Perry, and Wonderstruck by Taylor Swift.   I recently purchased a Daisy by Marc Jacobs rollerball and I love it :-) I'd love to get full sizes of that and the Chloe perfume.   I'd also like to try some CK and Versace ones but I don't know which ones to try. I hate perfumes with that ""cloying"" scent though - some are just too floral!"
AustralianMakeup,2qeloo,DarkPhoenix1993,1 point,Fri Dec 26 04:02:00 2014 UTC,"My current favourite perfume is a celebrity one, Girl by Pharrell Williams/Comme des garçons. I've read a lot of negative reviews for it but I've received lots of compliments about it and my mum even bought a bottle for herself she liked it so much. I think it has pretty good staying power.   Weirdly, some of the longest lasting perfumes I have used are the rollerballs from Sportsgirl. On the other end of the price spectrum, I'm looking at using the Mecca Cosmetica gift card I got for Xmas on a Byredo perfume. They are so amazing."

They are perfume oil though so it takes a bit to get used to them. Quite nice and improve with age. I recently bought some LTD Halloween and Christmas scents. Check them out seriously it will change your perfume forever."

AustralianMakeup,2qc46n,InForTheHaul,1 point,Fri Dec 26 06:53:45 2014 UTC,Which primer did you get? I have the translucent one but I'm curious to try the tinted ones.
AustralianMakeup,2qcjww,jamballdonut,1 point,Thu Dec 25 07:10:59 2014 UTC,"In all fairness, their freedom systems are their best asset. Perhaps start a blush palette if you already have a lot of eyeshadow? Their foundations aren't too bad but they're certainly not the best I have used, nor do they come in very pale/ivory shades if that is what you require. Their concealers are great but again not superrrrr pale. I have heard their gel liners in pots are wonderful too! I have owned a few of their lip products and definitely wasn't disappointed either! I am definitely keen to try their new HD foundation though, the reviews I have read so far have been positive!"
AustralianMakeup,2qcjww,Jessijames,1 point,Thu Dec 25 07:34:56 2014 UTC,"I use their Duraline to apply glitters, I'd suggest looking at their powder products."
AustralianMakeup,2qcjww,ComingUpMilhouse,1 point,Fri Dec 26 06:03:09 2014 UTC,"So, you think the Duraline is worth it? I ended up getting some eyeshadows & a freedom palette, but I am REALLY tempted by the Duraline, it's just the price putting me off."
AustralianMakeup,2qcjww,ComingUpMilhouse,1 point,Fri Dec 26 06:59:18 2014 UTC,"Do you have loose glitters? I don't use any of my eyeshadows wet, I use other cream based primers and I haven't yet thought to turn one of my powders into a liner with it. Some reviews from the Inglot website:   As everyone else has said, this turns powders into liquids and revived dried-out gel liners. I've used this as a base for glitter and custom matte lip colours. It is lip safe (make sure the pigment you're using is too!) and it lasts throughout a shoot, making it a great alternative to lip gloss.  This is my one and only HG of mixing mediums. It makes my pigments like liquid metal, it has massive staying power and a drop really goes a long way. Not to mention the price is amazing and beautylish carries it now yay xxoo   Really though I just use it as a loose glitter base. I used it here. It is pretty great and a little goes a long way but maybe save it for later if you don't need it now."
AustralianMakeup,2qcjww,firsttimemidwife,1 point,Fri Dec 26 07:17:15 2014 UTC,"I don't, but I want to pick some up, which is why I'm looking for something like the Duraline.  Ohhh, those are definitely some good ideas that I didn't even think of using it for!  I'll probably look into it & see if there's any YouTube videos about it before I do decide to pick it up!"

AustralianMakeup,2qcnzw,Jessijames,1 point,Thu Dec 25 08:23:11 2014 UTC,I don't think they have Maxima inside Myer. They should have Kit which is a sub group. But I don't think they do the beauty loop thing.  Edit: Kit does sell too faced.
AustralianMakeup,2qcnzw,panda_bear88,1 point,Thu Dec 25 08:27:26 2014 UTC,Yeah I have a kit in a Myer nearby but yes they don't count towards beauty loop which is why I'd rather a Mecca haha darn I'll have to settle for spending it at MAC -.-
AustralianMakeup,2qcnzw,innocuous_username,1 point,Thu Dec 25 08:47:24 2014 UTC,Yeah that was going to be my answer ... they have Too Faced in the Kit section at city store

AustralianMakeup,2qcnzw,AgentLauren,1 point,Thu Dec 25 09:38:43 2014 UTC,"I know, but the markup on YSL is pretty crazy, I'd rather buy it from Mecca so at least I get a little something more for my money! :-)"
AustralianMakeup,2qcnzw,mr-snrub-,1 point,Thu Dec 25 09:40:22 2014 UTC,"They have a small Too faced 'Mecca type' stand in Chadstone Myer near the Benefit counter, it has Too faced, Kit, Smashbox, Bare Minerals, etc., etc. But it's a small selection I think."
AustralianMakeup,2qcnzw,LittlePants,1 point,Thu Dec 25 12:41:54 2014 UTC,That is a kit cosmetics store which is owned by Mecca however they don't accept Mecca beauty cards which is why I am chasing Mecca's in myer :-)
AustralianMakeup,2qcnzw,NothappyJane,0,Thu Dec 25 12:49:11 2014 UTC,Myer has YSL in every store. But there's a Mecca inside of Myer Melbourne

AustralianMakeup,2q95ce,_HappyG_,2,Thu Dec 25 03:06:43 2014 UTC,"Yeah, they're lovely in the paediatric ward. They kept me on in paediatrics way longer than they should have (I was well past 18 when I finally got transferred), but it was so much nicer than adults. I got visited by dogs all the time (that's the best bit), and occasionally they'd bring round presents like DVDs and stuff just because. I miss paediatrics."
