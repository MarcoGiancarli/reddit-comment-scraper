cade,3dz4fn,JiNaMoN,2,Mon Jul 20 20:13:35 2015 UTC,"hey man this is AWESOME! i've got the following questions - i'm not a computer/electronics noob, but i am a complete noob when it comes to working with wood. What tools would I need to build this? An electric saw (idk if there's a better name for this lol) and an electric sander?"
cade,3dz4fn,Cabanaman,2,Mon Jul 20 20:19:31 2015 UTC,"It depends on how polished you want it to look. In reality, all you really need to make a functioning version is a circular saw or a miter saw, and a drill/impact driver.   From the looks of OP's build he probably used a jigsaw to make the fancy shapes in the MDF (Medium Density Fiberboard) and an orbital sander to make it look nice and smooth. Heck you could probably hand sand it, MDF is super easy to detail.  Edit: Forgot to mention, anywhere where there is MDF being attached to other pieces of MDF, you'll need to glue them together with wood glue in addition to any fasteners, otherwise it's very liable to fall apart. So you can add wood glue and some clamps if you are using MDF."
cade,3dz4fn,JiNaMoN,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:28:11 2015 UTC,"so basically the basics I would need are 1) circular saw, 2) drill driver, and 3) orbital sander. Would you recommend getting these new or could i just pick them up off CL or something?"
cade,3dz4fn,Cabanaman,3,Mon Jul 20 20:31:13 2015 UTC,"I would personally recommend just buying them new. You never know when you'll need a drill driver, especially if you're a homeowner. Tool sets go on sale pretty frequently, so you can get them pretty cheap. I recommend Milwaukee or Makita, but Ryobi will work fine for most people who use their tools maybe a few times a month."
cade,3dz4fn,JiNaMoN,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:22:07 2015 UTC,kk yeah I'll def look into those brands. Any particular brands for the saw and sander?
cade,3dz4fn,Cabanaman,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:22:52 2015 UTC,"Milwaukee and Makita are the best altogether brands for cordless. As far as wired gos I think the quality evens out a bit more. But like I said, the average user will be fine with Ryobi (basically Home Depot brand)."

Total cost (minus the controller/seat/TV/computer that I already had) was about $30. $25 for the MDF (which I used half of), $5 for three 1x4 boards, and about $3 for a box of 2"" Deckmate screws.  I took all of the measurements based on the seating position in my Miata, since I've raced them for years and that's what I'm used to. Minus hitting my knees on the clamps (which will soon be removed), it's a near perfect match.  Whole thing took about 3 hours, most of which was spent conceptualizing it since I went into this with a loose thought and no actual drawings."

cade,3dyhyo,monickers_ghost,4,Mon Jul 20 15:55:11 2015 UTC,"Dude - I know this isn't the answer you're looking for -- but seriously look at just building it yourself.   If you can borrow a circular saw and a drill, you can build this pretty easily, and for a lot less than a company would charge you.   They're asking $450+$125 shipping for about $150 worth of material.  Watch a few youtube videos on how to work a circular saw/jigsaw. Borrow or buy the tools, and build it yourself.  As an aside, I have had one transaction with these guys for a Zippyy Joystick. Was just fine. Paid $10 for the joystick. Works great."
cade,3dyhyo,justinkimball,2,Mon Jul 20 17:07:50 2015 UTC,"agreed, way to expensive, build one yourself"
cade,3dyhyo,quezlar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:46:46 2015 UTC,"I definitely get that it'd be a lot cheaper to make it myself, but is it that bad of a deal? I priced out everything that comes in the Deluxe Kit, and it looks like buying everything included in that would cost a little over $200 from GGG/Ultimarc. I'm obviously losing money on the wood/shipping, but the buttons/joysticks/etc bundle seemed reasonably priced.  Cutting it myself isn't entirely off the table, but since I haven't touched a saw since I made a few misshapen projects in middle school shop class, there'll be a bit of a learning curve to get past there."
cade,3dyhyo,justinkimball,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:33:18 2015 UTC,"The amount of effort that should take you to build would be maybe a couple hours -- factoring in some screwups.   The cost of the thing shipped to your house for the cheapest one was $450+125, so 575 shipped.   If it costs $200 for all the parts, and say $50 for the wood (which is probably a bit high), that puts you at $325. Even assuming that it takes you 3 hours to build this, that's $108/hour.   Hell, even if it takes you a full work day to build, that's $40.25/hour. If someone offered me $40.25 an hour to build arcade control panels, I'd take that job in a heart beat.  It's really a pretty raw deal. If you really don't want to work with wood and are OK with throwing money away, go for it, but the profit margin here is just obscene."
cade,3dyhyo,scoodidabop,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:05:14 2015 UTC,Other than saving boatloads of cash by building it yourself the only other issue I see with Monster's kits are the button spacing.  Those buttons are seriously far apart from one another - an issue I see on loads of kits.

And finally there is a light gun game called Six Gun Select. They should all be coming back up soon.  The Six Gun Select cabinet in particular seems to have sold for quite a bit on eBay ($1000-3000), but there isn't even an entry for it on KLOV.

For example, mine has more or less a height of 1,80m, a width of 70cm and a depth of 66cm.  Some people use plywood, but I think that MDF is easier and cheaper to work with if you want to add T-molding, paint and such. I made my cabinet with 5/8 in MDF, but there is also T-molding for 3/4 in MDF. But remember that MDF is effing heavy, so don't forget to add some caster wheels to that thing...

cade,3de26m,dustybeau,2,Wed Jul 15 21:29:34 2015 UTC,"That's a good ol' Electrohome G07, one of my favorite monitors. The very first thing I'd check is the horizontal width coil. We've had two /r/cade users in recent memory with collapsed G07s, and it was the coil both times. Their plastic structures are crazy brittle now due to age, so they break left and right. They also get extremely hot, causing cold solder joints and even lifted traces. Verify that your coil isn't broken or damaged, then pull the chassis and check that it's still well soldered, then we'll go from there.  Are you familiar with discharging and disassembling the monitor, or do you need a writeup on that?   EDITED THE NEXT DAY: D'oh, you said vertical collapse, didn't you? I was a couple of beers in when I wrote that reply. Check the yoke connector to make sure it's seated well and that you don't have any cold/broken solder joints on the header pins, they're very fragile.  If the yoke connector looks good, the problem is probably in the 400 section of the circuit, look over everything labeled 4xx for cold solder joints, and look closely for cracks in the PCB. Check the fusible resistor at FR401, make sure it's not open. Check the transistors at X401 and X402. I'd also check R522, I scribbled a note about it in red ink on my G07 schematic, so it must be important. :)"
cade,3de26m,NotAlanAlda,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:35:34 2015 UTC,"I don't want to hijack this thread, but I've got a Neotec 2515c with vertical collapse and thought maybe I could get some help here instead of starting another.  I tried reflowing the solder joints for the vertical IC, no dice. Replaced it with a new chip, still nothing. Should I just go ahead and recap it? Or are there any other problem areas I should check first?  Not sure it matters, but the guy I got the game from had it in an arcade room attached to an inside pool. The screen just collapsed out of the blue, not from moving."
cade,3de26m,dustybeau,3,Thu Jul 16 13:41:14 2015 UTC,"Massive edit, was thinking of a 27 neotec.   Check for +25VDC on pin 7 of IC301, if voltage isn't present, see if L103 is open. Check your V. Hold pot on remote board, then look at capacitors C307, C308, C312, C313. Lastly, Q301 and Q302 might be open or shorted."

cade,3de26m,dustybeau,2,Thu Jul 16 16:24:06 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I'm not very familiar with Neotec monitors, so I can't give you any super specific ""check R91"" type advice. Hopefully someone who knows those chassis better can chime in. A couple of kind of general pointers though:   This isn't ""scientific"", but give the chassis a few good love taps while it's running and see if the picture flickers back to life for a moment. If it does, that tells you for sure it's a spotty connection/solder joint/crack.  These have remote boards, right? Make sure it has a good connection, and test the v size/hold/etc pots.  Inspect the yoke connector. Reflow the header pins, they're easily bent so they're very susceptible to cold/broken solder joints. Check the female pins in the connector itself to make sure they haven't been pushed up into the housing. Make sure the connector itself is seated well.  Check everything in the vertical circuit (Google claims that's everything labeled 3xx) for cold solder joints and fine cracks in the PCB. Check resistors and diodes in particular.  You mentioned you replaced the vertical IC. While Googling this, I bumped into a thread where a tech mentioned that he replaces IC401 before replacing IC301.  A cap kit can help if you have ""partial"" collapse (i.e. a screen that's 'there' but too small), but complete collapse usually indicates you don't have continuity. That's why threads like this are always full of suggestions like ""check solder joints, check connectors"". :)"
cade,3de26m,penguinn,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:59:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'll accept anything at this point!  I gave the thing a few good taps while running when I first got it, but perhaps I didn't put enough love into it.  It'll take some time, but I'll run down your list and report back when I get a chance! I did run into that thread as well, but only after replacing IC301, of course.  Quick question, I've read in a few places about people reflowing entire boards with a heatgun. Is that safe for the board in this case? I've only ever used a soldering iron out of fear of hurting anything, just curious!"
cade,3de26m,dustybeau,2,Thu Jul 16 16:13:37 2015 UTC,"I know the Xbox kids use heat guns (and hair dryers, and ovens, and...), but they're dealing with surface-mount stuff, which is kind of a different ballgame. I definitely wouldn't recommend a heat gun on through-hole PCBs, you'll probably cook all the capacitors before you get the solder anywhere close to flowing.   As far as I'm concerned, a little flux, a small tip on your iron, and something good on Netflix is all you need to reflow a chassis."

cade,3de26m,sigmaseven,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:22:36 2015 UTC,If the issue occurred after moving the game I would suspect a loose connector or bad connection due to solder joints. Try wiggling some connectors around if you can or pull the deflection board and inspect the header pins for bad solder joints.

cade,3d6mfa,corylegend,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:47:01 2015 UTC,"I checked out the machine poster on KLOV.  Structurally the cabinet looks the same, it breaks down into two parts, the top sits on the boards on the side and fits neatly into the groves.  However I could find no markings like the one in the link such as midway or anything like that.   I find it highly unlikely that two cabinets were built exactly the same way for them to both be franken-cabinets.   They were something at some point,  but then again back in the 1980's they were cranking out so many different things we will probably never know."
cade,3d6mfa,c05ta,2,Tue Jul 14 15:00:25 2015 UTC,"I agree; whatever they are, they were definitely part of a production run -- albeit probably a small one. The fellow on KLOV is also from the Minneapolis area, so that seems to be the common thread.   I believe the only Midway part that the other guy identified was the handle basket, and the handle I can see on your machine seems like a match. That said, those handles were readily available off the shelf, and it doesn't seem to use any other Midway parts (e.g. their caster housings), so I doubt they're made by Midway anyway.   An educated guess would be that the cabinets were made in the early 90s. While it's not a Dynamo cabinet, the manufacturer was definitely taking his cues from the Dynamo HS8/HS9, and I think those were introduced around 1990. My best guess would be that some local cabinet shop bashed out 50 or 100 of these when operators were slamming Street Fighter II kits into anything they could find, and they all probably stayed in MN. Like you said, we'll probably never know the whole story, but I always find these little pieces of regional arcade history interesting."

Just needed to get a cabinet put together, but if it saves me the time and energy of building one, I'd be down for that. As for a price, I think it's in your best interest to get a price point set for pre-fab. I wouldn't want to insult you when I have not built one myself just yet. Living in an apartment leaves me a bit restricted with what I can do here. Maybe I will just shoot you an email through your site and we can hash out a deal, what I can get you guys to do for me, and what I can handle on my own. Best of luck with this!

I did hire 3 carpenters and an engineer to make this cab design many years back. The very first design fell over lol after a short game of street fighter 2...Ya I had to let him go. The reworked design has held up very good! It's very sturdy, I wanted a slim design that could hold up so we ended up with 5/8's laminated MDF.

There is a ton of folks who have jumped in the bartop market flat pack with some interesting designs.  The full size cabs from x arcade split the top and bottom halves to make shipping easier.  Look at other folks in the market and consider the design and logistic problems. You may want to tweak your designs to fit in a smaller box.  If you do, please raise the control panel a bit so it isn't recessed and a players hand and wrist can hang over the edge."

I agree with /u/JoshuaPearce, it looks to me like they used a little plastic filler to fix a defect in the plastic. The coating may have cured poorly over the filler, causing it to have a bad reaction to your cleaning product.   For what it's worth, for normal cleaning of your game consoles, you really shouldn't be using anything fancier than a microfiber cloth and water."

But remember light games are finicky and can cause a lot of headaches.  There are a few alternatives to use mame but they are all money vs performance.  I have had luck with usb light guns from ultimarc but they have issues and in a cabinet they would not work since you need mininum 4-6 feet from gun to screen.  You can find a happ style light gun board that will interface to a pc but its about 350 just for the board.
