castiron,3e3wjy,L0ser0,6,Tue Jul 21 19:32:36 2015 UTC,"Maine is the greatest state in the Union, it's no coincidence your vacation in Vacationland turned out nicely. I'm convinced that there's some sort of vortex that helps antiques migrate towards Maine, because I've never in my entire life seen so many freaking antique stores and flea markets in one area."
castiron,3e3wjy,Rats_In_Boxes,2,Tue Jul 21 20:49:39 2015 UTC,"I agree to an extent. It is a great state...and the reason you see so many antique stores (in my eyes) is because it is a very poor state. I lived there for 5 years, while my wife is from there. She was ready to leave when I first met her.  I do love visiting though!"
castiron,3e3wjy,Rats_In_Boxes,2,Tue Jul 21 21:01:09 2015 UTC,"Yea there's a lot of poverty in Maine, and a large portion of the state revolves entirely around seasonal tourism which is never sustainable. I'm just confused on like, how these antiques magically migrate up there? Where are they coming from?"
castiron,3e3wjy,Rats_In_Boxes,2,Tue Jul 21 21:05:44 2015 UTC,"Old people buy vacation homes up there. Hence ""vacationland"". That's what I think!"
castiron,3e3wjy,Monksbane102,2,Tue Jul 21 21:35:34 2015 UTC,"Haha so then they die, and all their stuff goes to an estate sale, to be bought by auction houses and private dealers and then it all winds up at a flea market! Voila!"

It was phased out by 1900. Those two lines (one top left, one bottom right) look like gate marks. As for worth, no idea, sorry :) gate marks also mean it's probably too old to ID a manufacturer"

castiron,3e3wjy,notapantsday,2,Tue Jul 21 21:49:09 2015 UTC,I'm wondering how much sense a cast iron meat grinder makes. Wouldn't it be super hard to keep rust-free with all the little gaps and crevices where moisture collects? And it won't build up seasoning either.
castiron,3e3wjy,Snackleton,4,Tue Jul 21 20:23:13 2015 UTC,Most grinders I've seen are cast steel or aluminum. Super easy to clean and does a great job too.

castiron,3e2dhd,gedvondur,2,Tue Jul 21 13:53:01 2015 UTC,How do you prevent it from coming off on the next meal you cook? Maybe I'm just not wiping it down enough after I cook?
castiron,3e2dhd,HoeCheese,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:07:57 2015 UTC,Wipe it with oil a bit more.  I haven't really had the problem where it comes off on the next meal...but then I haven't cooked a lot of white stuff either.  :-)

castiron,3e2dhd,rogue780,3,Tue Jul 21 13:30:34 2015 UTC,"Depending on what I cook, and how much effort I put into scraping/cleaning it, sometimes there will be a lot, sometimes barely any. I'm okay with some crap leftover, and I tell myself that it will just add seasoning to the pan but who knows if that's true. I assume the paper towel gets rid of most of it, and that heating the pan next time will burn off and sterilize anything that you don't want.  I don't really know if this is a good idea, but my point is that I also get some residue on the paper towel."

This recipe was a no-brainer. http://bakerbettie.com/easy-no-knead-skillet-bread/  Edit: If anyone is making bread for the first time like I was, I should have let the bread cool more than I did after I took it out of the oven.  It was still yummy, but it really started to look like real bread after it cooled down.  They say let it cool to room temperature-or just before that I suppose if you want to eat it while it is a little warm."

castiron,3e12n3,pirotecnico54,3,Tue Jul 21 14:17:13 2015 UTC,"Looks like good ingredients! If you want a little more rustic of a taste with something like this, consider steaming the veggies ahead of time, draining well, then throwing them in after you flip the steak, stirring them around in the juices. If you have the steak on top of the veggies it won't get that nice cast iron sear. As someone pointed out, it will steam, especially with all the water from the veggies.  Nice meal idea, and a pretty quick one too!"
castiron,3e12n3,hoobidabwah,3,Tue Jul 21 16:00:09 2015 UTC,"Was the steak already cooked and you just put it on the pan of cooking veggies to show what was being made, or did you actually cook the steak WITH the veggies/taters?"

castiron,3dwpgm,dudeman1018,5,Mon Jul 20 04:05:32 2015 UTC,My inclination at this point is to just use it. Using a cast iron pan is the way to (eventually) get a really good finish.
castiron,3dwpgm,animatorgeek,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:01:48 2015 UTC,When I first got my lodges I simply rinced them off to get rid of any dust collected while on the shelf and cooked something in it. I think I made hamburgers that night. After that I allowed the skillet to cool and scraped the solidified hamburger fat into the waste and wiped out the pan with water and a soft sponge. Anything stuck to the pan released easily. I then wiped it dry with a towel and then applies a very small amount of oil and wiped it out again with a towel I use specifically for oil application. I then placed it in the oven and set the oven to 450F for about a half hour and shut the oven down and allowed the skillet to cool on its own. I repeat these steps each time I cook and the skillet is working as intended.
castiron,3dwpgm,GenVG,2,Mon Jul 20 11:02:38 2015 UTC,"I recently bought a preseasoned 12"" Lodge.... I just washed it and used it straight from the store. I did have to apply my own seasoning a couple weeks into using it but I think that had more to do with my novice care taking"

castiron,3dwpgm,ThePwnSage,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:49:25 2015 UTC,The more you cook with it the better it'll function over time regardless of if you strip and re-season or just go for it. So I'd say save yourself the time and effort and just start using it :).

castiron,3dv9yp,RynoL_11,4,Sun Jul 19 20:31:00 2015 UTC,"Your unmarked pan is made by Birmingham Stove and Range, perhaps lesser known but very well-regarded. I'm assuming it's the older Red Mountain series (1930s-50s), can't see the markings to tell for sure. The other is a Wagner, made between 1935 and '59. Great pans for sure, treat them well and your great grandkids could use them too."
castiron,3dv9yp,max_power_000,2,Sun Jul 19 23:50:05 2015 UTC,The first one is a BSR (Birmingham Stove and Range) probably the older Red Mountain series (1930s-1949s) and the other one is a Wagner Ware (1939-1959) - both are really nice skillets - I'd be really interested to hear after a few months which skillet you prefer - normally I would tell you to strip and re-season the first 2 but since they came from your great grandmother you are pretty safe to use them (unless they have been sitting unused for 10-15 years without being used) if they were from like an antique store I'd say clean clean clean because you never know who used them or what they cooked in there.
castiron,3dv9yp,ajg2345,2,Sun Jul 19 23:50:12 2015 UTC,Awesome. Thanks for the response. I'm just going to continue on where my great grandma left off and keep building onto the seasoning. They are beautiful.

castiron,3dt1ro,Ashtonian,3,Sun Jul 19 04:29:25 2015 UTC,"Okay, so there's a few things here, but I think it's easily fixable.  First the self clean cycle.  Please don't do this.  it works, but it's possible to warp your pans doing it this way.  Probably less likely with newer pans that are thicker but if you ever get a piece of vintage cast iron you can easily warp your pan by heating up that much for that long with no food in it.  Don't worry about it, you didn't ruin anything for now, but this is just more of a ""in the future"" idea.  What you wiped off, the ""rust dust"" after the self-clean cycle you're actually wiping off everything that the self-clean cycle burned off.  Old or pre-seasoning, that sort of thing.  Not a problem at all.    To season, this is what I do:   Heat oven to 200 degrees If you have any rust left now, soak or scrub with a 50/50 vinegar/water mix to get rid of all the rust.   Clean again with hot water and soap. You should be down to bare metal at this point. Rinse off with cold water.  I have no idea why this works, but it helps prevent flash rust Dry thoroughly with towels or paper towels.  Should be as dry as you can make it. Put in your already preheated 200 degree oven for 20 minutes.  This does two things, first it finishes drying the pan completely, second it starts opening the metal up to get it really ready for seasoning. Take out of oven and wipe with a thin layer of oil.  In my opinion, do not use flax seed oil.  That science based technique is not very good (and I know, because I tried it.)  I suggest just using Crisco.  It's easy to apply, cheap, and you probably already have it in your house. Very Important - Wipe every last bit of oil that you can off with a paper towel.  Trust me, there's still enough on the pan at this point.  You want the thinnest possible layer of oil to season your pan. Put it back in the oven and increase the temp to 450. Bake at 450 for 1 hour. Let cool naturally.  I usually do my seasoning right before bed, and let it cool overnight. Repeat the steps (minus the vinegar, you won't need it now, and I also don't use soap at this point) 2 more times.  Three rounds of seasoning will get you a very nicely seasoned pan that's ready to use. Final step - cook.  Cook a lot.  Pan will just get better with use.  I suggest bacon."
castiron,3dt1ro,_Silent_Bob_,2,Sun Jul 19 13:40:03 2015 UTC,"This isn't bad.   As you're wiping on the oil 99% of this flash rust will come off and stick to the towel.

castiron,3dt1ro,GenVG,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:41:35 2015 UTC,"WELP, I hate that the flaxseed oil is not the way to go - mainly because thats the only high heat oil I have on immediate hand. It looks like most of the other articles I've read were based on that guide and most seem to indicate that after cooking a while it does indeed flake. So ixnay on the axseedflay oilyay.  Not really a fan of crisco & don't have it in the house. I think I'll try avocado oil and Safflower oil. I've got two pans so should be an interesting test. If that doesn't work I'll probably just cook a few packs of bacon and use that and be done with it.   Thanks for the info on the flash rusting and saving me the hassle of using flaxseed oil!"

I put the lid in my fancy breville toaster oven at 450F (highest).  When it's been in there for 20 min I assemble the pizza on a small peel.  I take out the lid and put it on a stove burner and get the temp to 525 or so, slide the small pizza in with the peal then put it in my toaster oven on the 'toast' setting.  The 'toast' setting keeps the the broiler (top) elements and the bottom elements constantly on.  After only 8 minutes the pizza comes out totally awesome, because I have the heat maximized soo well, and the pizza is small.  P.S. Why do people show their nice white chicken chili and not link the recipe?"
castiron,3dn7fm,icecow,5,Fri Jul 17 19:23:03 2015 UTC,"I've done the same with my lid.  I've also made bread, and use the bottom upsidedown to increase steam.  I kind of made my own recipe based off recipes from Kenji,Pioneer Woman, and Onceuponachef.com.  I roasted 1 Jalapeño and 2 pablano peppers tossed in olive oil til they were charred, then wrapped them in foil and let them steam a few minutes.  I put 3 cups of chicken broth in a bowl and cleaned the blackened skins from the peppers.  This adds some smokiness to the broth.  I added a cup of regular chicken broth (not part of the 3 cleaned with the peppers) and 1 can of great northern beans to a blender and pureed.  I chopped the peppers, 1 large yellow onion and sauteed for about 5 minutes, added minced garlic, 1T cumin, a few dashes of Chipotle chili powder(any chili powder works), paprika, salt, cayenne, white pepper, and Pex Pepper BeeBomb sauce.  2 minutes later I added the chicken stock and bean puree, brought it to a boil then reduced to a simmer for 20 minutes.  Then I added a tablespoon of corn flour to a cup or so of milk and stirred it into the mixture.  I added 1 1/2-2C shredded chicken, a can of great northern beans, a bunch of chopped cilantro, corn, and lime to taste (I used 1 lime), then let it simmer till it was warm (about 5 minutes).  I served it with warm corn tortillas, sour cream, and a jalapeño and habenero Pepper jack on top.   P.S.  I'm on mobile."

castiron,3do1d3,lucubratious,6,Fri Jul 17 20:58:48 2015 UTC,"If you just want a fine vintage skillet and don't mind paying full retail, there are probably 100 #8 Griswolds for sale for $40-$75. If you're hunting a bargain, old Lodges and BSRs are great daily cookers and pretty cheap. Also unmarked Wagners are excellent. Look for descriptions that say ""no repairs, no pitting, no cracks, sits flat.""  If you want to get more advanced, look for skillets that are not photographed well and/or not marketed well, and are dirty, rusty and crusty. Might take weeks.  Also, check out Iron Man Auction on facebook."
castiron,3do1d3,bigpeepz,3,Fri Jul 17 21:25:24 2015 UTC,"Personally I'd recommend looking around locally - antique malls, flea markets, thrift stores and the like. The problem with buying online is that you can't see the pans and any potential problems. You might find better bargains locally as well. Pans are heavy and expensive to ship, and ebay is probably more of a collectors market which puts prices higher.  What you should buy depends on your budget and what you want in a pan. Do you just want something great to cook in, or do you also want aesthetic appeal and collectibility? Griswold is the most desirable and carries the highest price. Wagner is probably second place, but still quite expensive. With both of these, you're paying for the logo and collectibility. If all you want is a great vintage pan to use, look for brands like Lodge and Birmingham Stove and Range (BSR). They didn't mark their pans, but made quality cast iron. Check out Cast Iron Collector for how to identify unmarked pans. There are tons of other good American brands, check out more on that site for others.  With any pans, you'll need to make sure they're not damaged, which generally amounts to checking for cracks and making sure they sit flat. Crusty old seasoning build-up is fine, it can be easily removed. Minor rust can be removed as well, but heavy rust will likely have pitted the surface. Avoid anything that isn't made in North America. I'd generally avoid pans that say ""Made in USA,"" as these are later pieces and tend to have rougher surfaces and thicker casting. For example, Griswolds should say, ""Erie, PA, USA"" and Wagners, ""Sidney, O."""

castiron,3do1d3,max_power_000,2,Fri Jul 17 23:56:04 2015 UTC,"If you're talking about the same ages of pans (ie. before 1960), I don't think there's any noticeable difference in quality between the major brands, in terms of day-to-day cooking. There are users here with far bigger collections than me though, maybe they can chime in. Because Lodge and BSR didn't mark their pieces, they don't have the collector appeal. They were all cast well, ground and polished and have nice smooth finishes for cooking. I guess take a look around, see what appeals to you and your budget."

You won't damage your pans and if your seasoning is good you won't damage that either.  And even if you do, it'll fix itself with more cooking.  Mmmm, bacon.  The only issue I could MAYBE see with this dish is the acid in the wine.  But only if you're completely paranoid, it's not something I would think twice about.  I make a pork dish that makes a sauce with wine and Italian dressing all the time (at least 3 or 4 times month because my kids love it and will actually eat it) and it has never once damaged any of my pans I've made it in."

All you have to do is just keep cooking with it normally. The easiest (and tastiest) way to add layers of seasoning back is just to fry up some bacon.  Scrambled eggs can be a challenge in cast iron at even the best of times (over easy/medium/hard eggs are far easier), so the fact that you were able to cook them at all means you already know how to get a pan very well seasoned. Just keep doing what you did before and you'll be just fine."

I get constant requests to make this at home, and it's a great way to show off how versatile cast iron can be. No casserole dish can match the crust that develops when you bake this one right in the skillet, and of course cleanup is a breeze.  Enjoy!  Edit: Well this is awkward. It looks like the automoderator over on Recipes thought my post was spam...  :P  Working to get it fixed now, stay tuned.  Edit 2: Fixed! Thanks mods. :)"

castiron,3divio,CodeAfro,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:04:07 2015 UTC,"You probably will find you can set the heat a little lower with cast iron - once it's hot it stays hot. Bacon tends to be a little sticky, you'll probably end up with some residue. No need to scrub with coarse salt, you can safely use water. Get some cheap nylon scouring pads, I just linked to this blog post in another post recently. They scrub off stuck food but don't touch the seasoning. You can buy dozens for the cost of one of those chainmail ones. Those stainless steel scrubbers are great when restoring a pan, but I wouldn't recommend it for a seasoned pan.  Your method for drying after cleaning sounds good, but you just need a tiny bit of oil, it shouldn't be wet and oily. Just enough to recover any dull bits. Feel free to use whatever oil's handy, PAM is great for getting a thin layer. If there's grease left in the pan after washing you won't need this extra. No need to put oil on the pan after this step, it won't rust or anything as it's seasoned. You'll probably find you don't need to oil the handle, sides, bottom, etc very often. However, make sure to check the bottom every once and a while because the seasoning often gets scraped off there and can rust.  You can use whatever cooking oil you'd like, but think about smoke points. Searing a steak requires an oil with a high smoke point. I usually use peanut oil for high heat applications, but there are others.  As for vintage pans, my advice is look around a bit before buying - don't grab the first one you see (unless it's a great deal obviously). Definitely make sure they sit flat, I would avoid any that don't. There's no fixing ones that are warped. The real old ones might have a bit of a wobble since they're so thin, which is ok. If it spins freely on a flat surface then don't bother with it."
castiron,3divio,max_power_000,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:56:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tips!   Adding onto the cooking oils, do you generally just add enough to cover the bottom in a thin layer? Maybe more, maybe less depending on what your cooking?  I definitely went around to all the local antique shops and pawn shops looking for any good old pans before I got the Lodge. That was the only one I found so I'll probably have to expand to the next town over.  edit: I found these scouring pads. I'm guessing this is what your talking about single and 24 pack"
castiron,3divio,max_power_000,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:45:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah for cooking oil, it depends on what you're cooking. For most things that I cook, just enough to cover the bottom is enough. You can always add more as you need it. Those scouring pads look right, but the brand doesn't really matter. Should be able to find no-name ones at the grocery stores or dollar stores. Like 4 for a dollar or less.  Finding the old pans can be tough, I think a lot of us on this sub spend way too much time searching haha. I see a lot at antique malls, but usually way more money than I went to spend. If you've got flea markets in your area that's probably your best bet."

Probably could have let it rest for another 5 min. Sliced and poured the sauce over the top.

castiron,3df75h,The_Pan_Handler,2,Wed Jul 15 21:03:55 2015 UTC,"Agreed, the #8 is a great all-around size.   For baking it's about half the size of a typical casserole dish, which makes adjusting recipes easy. (i.e., If a recipe calls for a 13""x9"" casserole dish, a half recipe will usually fit in an 8"" skillet pretty well.)"
castiron,3df75h,RandomlyEdible,2,Thu Jul 16 23:04:48 2015 UTC,"As for 1) that's a hard one.  I'm not really into making pizza, exactly, so I can't speak to that.  But my 10.5"" and my 12"" pan are my two most used, and I would have a REALLY hard time choosing between the two.  I guess, if I had to, I'd go with the bigger one all things being equal.  2) No, regular oven mitts, assuming that they're fairly thick ones, will be fine.  That's all I use."
castiron,3df75h,_Silent_Bob_,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:18:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks!   Well, hmm, since you have both sizes, pizza aside, would you still recommend the bigger one if you had to pick one just generally speaking? I'll probably just go with it since it's pretty cheap either way. Is there much of a difference in weight between the two?

castiron,3df75h,gedvondur,2,Wed Jul 15 21:26:55 2015 UTC,"Regular oven mitts, or grill armor are fine.  Lodge also makes nice little silicone slip covers for the handles of the cast iron pans.  I also use my 8"" pan for baking a lot.    One of the best pieces of advice I ever got about cast iron was to remember to moderate temperature.  Cast iron is a heat sink, once it gets hot it STAYS hot.  To avoid excessive sticking and issue, make sure you keep the temperature down.  For example, if in an aluminum teflon plan I normally set my gas stove to 6 or 7 (out of 8/high) but in cast iron, I warm the pan at 3 or for and cook at 4 or five, unless I am searing.  When searing warm the pan to five, then put the spurs to it."
castiron,3df75h,gedvondur,2,Wed Jul 15 20:31:53 2015 UTC,"I saw those covers, maybe I will pick one up. Thank you very much! Will remember to be careful with the heat :)"

It insulates it well enough without an oven mitt, and for me gripping the pan is easier than it was with one of those silicone pot-holder things"
castiron,3df75h,max_power_000,2,Fri Jul 17 16:00:48 2015 UTC,"My first pan was a 12"" and if I could go back, I'd go slightly smaller.  I've now purchased smaller pans. The big one is nice for baking but for stovetop work it's a little large/unwieldy."

If dish detergent and warm water would remove seasoning then I wouldn't have to spend days putting the old pans that I buy through electrolysis and then days in a caustic lye bath. I would just wash them with detergent and warm water. Seasoning is hard as hell to remove. Wash your skillets."

castiron,3df4j8,RandomlyEdible,4,Thu Jul 16 22:54:15 2015 UTC,They sell hard plastic scrapers for cast iron.  I usually just use super hot watery and a sponge.  Those bits should not be part off your seasoning

Some use soap, I do not.  Scrub with salt if there's still stuck on pieces, or a metal chain mail scrubber (which I love) Dry toughly, heat on medium-low heat for a few minutes, and apply a very thin coat of oil (I use crisco or crisbee.)  Wipe all the oil you can off with a paper towel or blue shop towel and let cool.  There will still be enough oil on there to help build seasoning and prevent rusting."

castiron,3df4j8,7thrandomguy,2,Thu Jul 16 01:51:16 2015 UTC,I would not leave burned food remnants on a cast iron pan. That does not build up seasoning; that builds up crud. I would clean the pan back to bare iron and re-season.

Otherwise, if it's just a touch up you need, cook with the pan as normal and reseason on the stove. After cleaning, just heat the pan to dry it, coat with a thin layer of oil (PAM works great) and heat on the stove for a few minutes. It doesn't need to smoke to work."

Edit: I just checked and apparently le Creuset does indeed make a non enameled pan with a wooden handle. I'm kind of amazed by that--part of why cast iron is awesome is because it's oven safe.

Make a pound of bacon. Now take the drippings and combine them. Swish the pan in a circle three times repeating Pi Pi Pi, or alternatively sing the Pi Song.  Place on low heat for along time. If your burner wont get low use a flame stretcher or whatever it is called.   Let me google that for you  Haha that's a link to your answer not to the LMGTFY site. For a change.  Save the bacongrease. It is awsome in biscuits. Clean pan and use. If not good enough then use the bacon grease and do it some more.  Fun fact: an iron pan is not a low fat utensil. It is a even heat and easy to clean one. Do not confuse with teflon."

It's quite tight to unscrew the first time, but i got it off by running a kitchen towel through the knob at the end and helping that to unscrew the knob. It's a bit tricky, but you'll get the hang of it.   However... I doubt it's necessary to season it bottom up. Just start cooking and remember to reheat to dry, and wipe down with oil or whatever, after each wash.   Mine was a bit tricky in the beginning and i burned a few things but a year later, it is smooooooth  Edit: Is this the one?"

castiron,3dcu28,icyblack,2,Wed Jul 15 07:13:15 2015 UTC,"Perfect Corn Muffins From Cook’s Illustrated, January/February 2015   Maybe you didn’t grow up eating corn muffins and you’re wondering how they’re different from cornbread. I suppose from a distance they might seem similar — cornmeal, fat, leavener, baked into something of a quick bread — but true Southern cornbread would never have sugar in it and are decidedly less cakey. Given that I just learned that corn muffins the official state muffins of Massachusetts, I think we can safely presume that they’re what happens when you let Yankees near Southern staples. (I’m joking. Mostly.) Most corn muffins are made with an equal or even greater amount of flour than cornmeal; these are 2/3 cornmeal, and seem like it wouldn’t be terribly hard to replace that last 1/3 with a gluten-free flour mix if needed. CI had set out to make a savory corn muffin, using only 3 tablespoons sugar, but I liked these with 1/4 to 1/3 cup for the light sweetness I remember growing up, but at a level that’s still anything but cloying. Finally, CI recommends Arrowhead Mills Organic Yellow Cornmeal, and says that you should not use coarse-ground or white cornmeal, but I used a mixture of fine yellow unfancy Indian Head cornmeal and medium-grind Bob’s Red Mill (I used this portion for the pre-cooking step, to soften it) and had no complaints about the final texture.   2 cups (280 grams) yellow cornmeal, to be divided 1 cup (130 grams) all-purpose flour 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon baking soda 1 1/4 teaspoons fine sea or table salt 1 1/4 cups (300 ml) milk, whole is best here 1 cup (240 grams) sour cream (full-fat plain yogurt should work here too) 8 tablespoons (115 grams) unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly 3 to 5 tablespoons (35 to 60 grams) sugar (see Note up top about sweetness) 2 large eggs Heat oven to 425°F (220°C). Either grease or line a 12-cup standard muffin tin with disposable liners.      Whisk 1 1/2 cups cornmeal, flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt together in a medium bowl.   In a large bowl (if you have a microwave) or a medium saucepan (if you do not), combine milk and remaining 1/2 cup cornmeal.     In a microwave, cook cornmeal–milk mixture for 1 1/2 minutes, then whisk thoroughly, and continue to microwave in 30-second increments, mixing between them, until it’s thickened to a batter-like consistency, i.e. the whisk will leave a clear line across the bottom of the bowl that slowly fills in. This will take 1 to 3 minutes longer.     On the stove, cook cornmeal mixture over medium heat, whisking constantly, until it thickens as described above, then transfer to a large bowl.  Whisk butter, then sugar, then sour cream into cooked cornmeal until combined. At this point, the wet mixture should be cool enough that adding the eggs will not scramble them, but if it still seems too hot, let it cool for 5 minutes longer.    Whisk in eggs until combined. Fold in flour mixture until thoroughly combined and the batter is very thick. Divide batter evenly among prepared muffin cups; it will mound slightly above the rim.    Bake until tops are golden brown and toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, 13 to 17 minutes, rotating muffin tin halfway through baking to ensure even cooking.     Let muffins cool in muffin tin on wire rack for 5 minutes, then remove muffins from tin and let cool 5 minutes longer. Serve warm.    P.S. You can make your own makeshift muffin liners from 5 to 6-inch squares of parchment but please, maybe test it first to see if it can reach the heat the package promises, as these, despite advertising a heat limit of 450°F, set off my smoke detector multiple times and were definitely not worth the trouble."

It was simply a layer of a quality canned turkey chili, a layer of grated cheese, topped with a layer of corn bread mixture, and baked.  It was strangely good for how simple it was.  So simple there's plenty of time to think about how to tweak the chili, and get choosy about what kind of cheese.  P.S. Soaking the corn meal sounds like a good idea."

castiron,3da0yq,kaitstav,3,Tue Jul 14 17:44:55 2015 UTC,Thanks for the detailed write up. I went through a similar process as you. There was some person's blog that highlighted the use of flax seed oil as being the ultimate seasoning for CI and had a lot of pseudo-science to back up their claims. While the blog post was well intentioned it led a lot of people in the wrong direction. I finally just made a ton of bacon in my skillet and that made a really nice base seasoning. I still have my bottle of flax seed oil and now use it to wipe the skillet down after I have rinsed it with hot water and mild dish soap (soap won't hurt a good seasoning) and I have no clue what else to do with the flax seed oil.  As far as Lodge's rough finish I agree but didn't have a media blaster to smooth it out. For the past couple of years I've always used a metal spatula and now the finish is smooth as glass (although I may have a surplus of iron in my blood now).
castiron,3da0yq,Kammuller,6,Tue Jul 14 18:53:24 2015 UTC,I second the suggestion of using a metal spatula. Don't be afraid to really bear down with the flat edge. It can be a great tool not just for cooking but also for cleaning off baked-on gunk. After a couple years of regular use the surface will be wonderfully smooth. The peaks get worn down and the pits get filled in with seasoning.
castiron,3da0yq,animatorgeek,2,Tue Jul 14 19:32:30 2015 UTC,You could always use the flax as a supplement. That's what it was originally intended for.
castiron,3da0yq,Kammuller,2,Tue Jul 14 19:10:33 2015 UTC,Yeah that's what I pretty much do and it seems to work well for that.
castiron,3da0yq,GenVG,2,Tue Jul 14 19:24:51 2015 UTC,You could use that old flax seed oil to treat some lumber or something.
castiron,3da0yq,sixtrees,2,Wed Jul 15 00:02:02 2015 UTC,"Bad idea, flax oil goes rancid fast. Mineral oil is good for wood."
castiron,3da0yq,notapantsday,3,Wed Jul 15 06:47:39 2015 UTC,"I've had the same experience with flaxseed oil on my cast iron. It produces a pitch-black glossy finish that actually has pretty good nonstick properties, but it flakes off way too easily. On my pans and griddle, I just use regular rapeseed oil and while the patina doesn't look as gorgeous, it's way more robust.  However, I still use flaxseed oil for my waffle iron. Since there's usually no stirring, scraping or scrubbing, the patina doesn't have to be as robust and so far I haven't had any of it flaking off. And even after cleaning my waffle iron (thoroughly) with dish soap, water will still form little droplets and roll off. I can't seem to get the same effect with rapeseed oil."
castiron,3da0yq,JayTongue,2,Tue Jul 14 20:21:05 2015 UTC,Where can I find rapeseed oil? Is it legal in my state?

castiron,3da0yq,GenVG,3,Wed Jul 15 06:50:53 2015 UTC,good write. CI is very simple. No need to complicate it. Lodge pre-seasons their CI so it's pretty fool proof. The texture isn't an issue TBH. Just follow the routine and it works perfectly.
castiron,3da0yq,riveramblnc,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:00:40 2015 UTC,I agree about the texture part. I just found that it's a bit harder to get all the excess oil out when you aren't sure what to be looking for when you're new in the game.

Cook cauliflower on stove top with just some salt on high heat for ten minutes or so.  Put the mush in a siv to squeeze the water out.  Mixed with an egg and (best part) a quarter package of cream cheese.  It will look like a dough after mixing a bit.  Divide the ""dough"" and mush the ball into the pan.  Cook without toppings for 12-15 minutes in a 450 oven.  It will brown and crisp.  The add toppings like any other pizza.  It's defiantly not doughy like a pizza, but has a nice flavor.  Something different and low carb if your craving pizza.  Easier then it looks- like most cast iron pizzas."
