That's really interesting that the pass has an effect on your score - of course, it indirectly did because of the attack bonus, but this is even more interesting.   Typically, does this means that simply penetrating through with your highest damage attacker -> active pass -> active shoot will always get you the best score? I'm curious on whether attacking or passing with your penetrator would give you a higher score..."

Honestly if she had a Jin and Kei Nemesis she would slay or a decent rivalry to splashable units...  With her it's all about going for citrate in this metagame and then either stack endless burning matter or give her the other ardor striker stone.   As always, she benefits from the Nari Sylla striker approach like her other 1. 5 bar strikers and those that could use some pen power, but nothing says a good old critical front either thunder or dark with baltheon or yuri totem couldn't work, it's all about the spirit stone management and access to legendary or unique when building her.   Her status as an ardor card makes her ridiculously splashable with the presence of Sammy and Lucian/Miss big balls wich opens other support possibilities in Nezariel Kiki/Yuri Sharr lines that despite unorthodox often accomplish more than standard Baltheon lines in Auto.   As for the skillset I would prioritize extreme over pulverize, the metagame is ridiculously sided to critical reduction every point of citrate counts.   By level 60 full supberb the ideal would be 5/5/3/5."

Now, if Defenders were able to keep their 30% redux every minute they don't have the ball, how would any pen-less attacker ever get through?

soccerspirits,3e2040,lastra1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:37:29 2015 UTC,"I'd say Erica is mediocre choice. Her ardor buff is nice, but you will probably look to replace her sooner or later. The only one that really needs that buff is Lucian, so you want to replace her with live totem like Yuri. For others it's only useful.  If you didn't invest too much in Eden, I'd replace her with Erica, but don't invest too much in Erica either.  As for relationships, she buffs Lucian and Nari and gets buff from Victoria.  Also for PvE only, you can use her as GK while having Lucian face the striker, that way you'd recover 35% of Erica's HP each shot. But you'd probably prefer tanking the ball with Lucian and make opponent try to steal from him giving major healing to whole line."

soccerspirits,3e2040,Wahuh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:43:45 2015 UTC,Hercules is meh (until we see if his EE is any good). There are alot of better penetrators that can replace him.

Each Neris used to guarantee a power-up means 600k less for you, and it's only to guarantee one stage of power-up. If you used five advanced Nerises to get your stone to +15, that's like 3,000,000 gold down the drain. In reality it would definitely cost much less to power any stone to +15."

Also really depends on the rest of your team. A few units only start to shine with a few superbs so it might be wise to prioritize them.

Consistent 1k5-2k non-crits against Jin, and with 2 active passes from Nari+ Silla when the ball reach front 2nd time, it's gg for Jin. Used to run Kirin and it just didn't go as well. Maybe if I had Metatron + Bell then they could combo with Kirin better... but those legends make any team better"

I just worry as soon as I actually get sharr to 5/5+120 the meta shifts somehow again and its a huge wasted investment."

On that note, I also think beth/meta/bell is the much stronger version compared to beth/meta/duke.. my eden can typically tank those dukes and turn around and kill them in return, just so few offensive buffs in that line for him, is pretty funny actually."

(which is pretty stupid how many speed debuffer are now this days...)"" srly last time i see someone using it in bot and my william was holding the ball  , i literally watched 35 min of william rekting defenses with out shooting... cuz i couldnt move at all...  if u gonna use a infinity combo midline place ur attacker or milky or watever it is in the rear...      or u could try my way... passer in mid... alot of people doesnt like this stat and srly dunno why , passers in mid are pretty powerful and speed up things in midfield saving u time to focus in offense or defense  by the way my setup mid is (victoria, neraziel, lucius) this 3 hold midfield pretty well"

It's a competitive game as far as pvp, some units will perform better in certain situations that's ok. Stop crying about it. You don't hear me crying about neura? She's absolutely broken in any back line with Jin or kei.   Simple fact of the matter is this, some units can perform better than others in certain situations, that doesn't make them broken. Adjust to their meta ... That's part of this game strategizing. Having trouble with a ravian/jeu ? run a bit of reflex & counter attack resist, so what if they get the 45% life don't let them have the ball back. Having trouble with meta/Beth? Try things like Kevin in top, ignition cata etc. set up your team to where nobody is going to bother with the metatron & then blast through the Beth....   Don't get me wrong people using the same team over and over is annoying. However there is something that I find even more annoying is people complaining about units over and over. Some set ups will counter yours. Some will stomp you. It happens move on. I didn't complain about the milky way BS. I just adjusted to it by setting up a Zibroi whever milky was.   These are simply my opinions, down vote me if you must however I just would like to come onto this subreddit and see the people and jokes & content that I come here for; not whining about ravian, meta, Beth, & jeun in every other topic.

Cause I mostly see hiro/bea/blade.  Also, idk what goal keeper you have but mine def does not survive two hiro shots and I use Jin.... Ravian requires stealing a ball back which is so easy to counter because if they run a 4 person top line their mid gets stomped meanwhile you have access to all the reflex crit resist and counter attack you need to just pummel the front line and get it back to your mid or even to your striker. My point is, she's not as op as everyone make her out to be.... People just haven't adjusted accordingly.

It won't bring you anywhere and it seems like you're only trying to get others join in on the hate for whatever you're complaining about.  Like you said, the best thing to do is to sit down and look for a way to counter it.  It's a strategy and a very good one at that, that's why it's used so often. Now come up with a better one, or one of your own instead of trying to prove it ""unfair"".  Hell I do like those ""unfair"" setups better than simple brute force mids. I don't like OHKO strikers, I like utility ones. You can't simply stack DR, HP and CR against them like you normally do. You need to actually think.  There's a reason you can win against those strong superb bosses with a pretty weak team if you have the right setup (excluding the top dogs that can brute force them).

I could use some help here to see how to arrange my team that makes the most sense around here, because obviously I don't have the ideal players to support her.           Ravian(EE) Iggy(EE) Silla(ace)    Guin(EE 6 star) Eden Cynthia Sammy   Dale Luka Nenua     Jin(EE)      other significant players on hand: Lilith, Lucian, Latios, Alkyde (0 spb), Ami (fspb ST to 5 star)  Keep in mind that I am only rank 69, so a team good for mid-game is good enough for now.  Shall I build a reflex Ravian or a critical Ravian?  The existing formation is to give Ravian some critical buff; but on the other hand, I know that Alkyde is the best to pair with Ravian for reflex debuff, so another alternative I am thinking is to put Alkyde and Lilith to frontline.  Of course, I will need to wait for next Alkyde boss matches to mspb her which I am afraid will be months away...  Shall I swap Sammy with Luka?  I am putting Dale in the backline as a penetrator to give reflex debuff all the way from back to the front, Luka is to feed him penetrate buff; but Sammy back and Luka mid probably better in general?   Shall I move Dale up to the mid instead?  Any suggestions on my team?  Am I doing something crazily wrong now?"
soccerspirits,3dxh6o,theKONSTER,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:57:57 2015 UTC,"The only thing that is glaringly 'wrong' is the Luka back line. However given what you have, it may not be the worst choice you have.  Usually with back lines you want to focus on buffing your GK. HP/Crit resist totems are the way to go. Also I don't think Dale necessarily needs Luka's pass to function as a strong penetrator, especially given the fact that he may not reliably receive it when Luka's active is down. What I suggest is put Lucian in Luka's place, let Dale penetrate on his own.   If Eden isn't fully invested(E, 5star at least, few superbs) switch her out for Sammy. She's a good CM and ball holder, better so than a 4 star Eden.  As for the front line... it's hard to tell. Ravian is best utilized when she is focused on either crit or reflex. Iggy's buff is good but Silla doesn't synergize with her that well. I feel like Alkyde/Lilith/Ravian has the better synergy you want. Put Ravian on the right since I think her positional buff is better there."
soccerspirits,3dxh6o,kaldyra,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:25:52 2015 UTC,"Eden is 5 star but 0 superb.  So I think you are right, I should use Sammy instead.  Sounds like I should bench Luka then.   Am I right that you are suggesting Lucian only for pve since his heal is already nerf'd in pvp?"
soccerspirits,3dxh6o,theKONSTER,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:23:27 2015 UTC,"Sorry for late reply.   Yes, healing was nerfed in PvP. Even though, I think Lucian will be better than Luka as a defender. He recovers action bar and spirit as well, which could help out on Ravian's active as well. Also, the small amount of healing may help out."
soccerspirits,3dxh6o,lastra1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:30:27 2015 UTC,"For Ravian, you will want to partner with reflex modifiers and/or top class stealers. Silla and Lilith are the latter and Alkyde is the former, regrettably you didn't superb her. Also Silla is your ace, so you can't really bench her.  You may want to get Dale in mid to combo it further with Ravian. Dale breaks the line and attacks opponent backline resulting in their further loss of reflex before Ravian takes her first shot. Additionally, you may want to move Dale behind Ravian, so that he could occasionally kill defender to give your striker a one-on-one chance.  With Dale not any longer in def, you may want Guin to replace him.  I'd also add Sammy CM in PvP, she is as tanky and buffy as Eden, but has much more reflex when superbed (Eden is still easier to superb), in the long run, she'd be better. She can also serve as backline PvE healer when you won't need her in PvP, so she's definitely worth some investment.  With Iggy not standing anymore in front, You may want to add her in mid. Reason is Cynthia needing crit rate to shot her real damage potential. Iggy is another great stealer.  You may add Luka mid, she's probably more useful there for her speed de/buffing and adding explosive power to Dale. If you had spare place that is.  To replace Luka, you can add temporarily Latios. Luka could be useful in defense when PvE (you'd prefer Sammy though), but in PvP, Latios HP buff would be more beneficial to Jin.  In short, sorry, moved almost whole of your team..     PvP     Alkyde Silla Ravian   Cynthia Sammy + Iggy/Luka Dale   Latios Nerua Guin    Jin"
soccerspirits,3dxh6o,kaldyra,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:25:16 2015 UTC,"Thx Iastra1 and konster for the inputs!  While moving Dale up really makes sense to me, but I have a concern that shall I really move Guin down to the back?  I feel that her line buff should be optimal in mid?  Could you tell me what am I missing?  Also, since you mentioned Latios ""temporarily"" to buff Jin, do you think Ere Ere (2 superb 5 star) can be a better option for me for now?  Her buff's slightly more HP, some reflexes but no defense, plus her skill sets are just much better as a defender and cheaper to invest.  For long term I guess I should try to find Kiki but she never appears in my scout."
soccerspirits,3dxh6o,lastra1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:17:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, Ere Ere will be better than Latios, but not the best. However, as opposed to Latios, she will be usable for PvE for a while. You may decide to go Avnore some time later, since he is the best.  As for Guin, in the backline you will be more using her as penetrator than buffer. Having a reliable way to move the ball out of danger zone makes game easier, even at cost of some HP. You will want to replace her later with some attacker, because her AI won't always do her job. I suggest putting her in defense because you have no better person for that role. While she is a good totem, she is useful mainly to power strikers and Ravian is not one of them. In mid, Iggy's buff is better since both Cynthia and Dale don't have their own crit rate, but have skills that activate on crit."

soccerspirits,3dxh6o,TheJediJew,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:40:18 2015 UTC,I think you haven't got an answer yet because no one is sure what you mean.  Just stockpile ST before the match and spam away once it's open. You can keep the gift ST in your inbox over the week if needed and use it then as well.

Your problem is that you don't have any other Ardor slot. You may change your CM or put it in your support slot player depending on who it is. Yuri is good candidate, you can use her front PvE and back PvP.  Also it may be right time to switch to Saramir ace with two light legends being off color and Silla. Saramir has Ardor slot.  Having that said, Khirel doesn't need much offensive power in PvP, since he can kill anyone without it, but in PvE you will like him to have as much damage as possible."
soccerspirits,3dxh6o,Moreni-to,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:45:17 2015 UTC,"Don't you think that my team profit more from the silla Ace ?   For PvP my team look like that :          Lucid Silla Baltheon   Duke P.Meiran Beth   Yuri Khirel Kiki    Jin     Nerua support  I want to change P.Meiran and Lucid in the future :)  Edit : If i change lucid by beatrice and P.Meiran by Saramir, i think you are right to choose the Saramir Ace but i'm not sure if it's a good choice in the case that I change the color of my striker and my CM."
soccerspirits,3dxh6o,lastra1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:55:49 2015 UTC,"Except for mid penetrator, your most key players are D/WW. If you mixed up Bell and Sharr, you will be absolutely right, but not necessarily with your current setting. On the other hand, Metatron and Ravian are dark, so they only supports Dark ace.  Hybrids are also better for long term planning since their ace is one class higher than rainbow. Unless you choose to add Bell and Sharr into your formation.  Do you already have someone on mind to add?"
soccerspirits,3dxh6o,Moreni-to,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:14:08 2015 UTC,I have Beatrice/Hiro/Sharr as potential striker.   And for my CM i was thinking about Sammy but Saramir seems good too :)
soccerspirits,3dxh6o,lastra1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:18:41 2015 UTC,"Let me give a vote to Sharr. Reason is called Jin. To be precise, most TOP rankers will be using Jin, because Jin is Jin and Sharr eats Jins. IF you Sharr, then there is no other chouce but to keep Silla since Sharr lacks penetration power. Give her Tera too.  If by chance you actually listen to my advice and use Saramir, then go Ravian over Bea. Reason is called Jin too. Bea is mediocre when she fails to crit, Ravian never cared about minor details like critting xD And the biggest twist comes here: With Silla not being an ace, you can replace her with another player for EMB, like Black Daisy, Kevin, Veronica or... Sammy.  Bea eats Keis, but the higher you go, the more Jins will be waiting for you.  Well, at least that's few of many ways, you have to decide which path you prefer to take."
soccerspirits,3dxh6o,Moreni-to,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:30:29 2015 UTC,Thank you for your advice ! I didn't mention Ravian because she isn't really good with Baltheon and it's a waste for me to not use him :/
soccerspirits,3dxh6o,SoccerHeli,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:33:54 2015 UTC,"Hey, so I read some of lastra's reply's and just wanted to offer a different perspective on the Ace situation.  Silla's ace is very strong especially if you have a team that consists of 3 colors, as every player will benefit from it. Late game Silla ace is the go to for Korean players as someone pointed out most have her as ace. The reason for this is because the damage reduction is just bananas and goes far beyond what the 30% hp a hybrid ace provides, especially with higher up teams running EBM in the front."
soccerspirits,3dxh6o,lastra1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:16:28 2015 UTC,"True that. As apology, I'll add one last tip: your team composition is very similar to what rank number 2, Little uses, especially when you add Sharr with Tera. From this point, you may also choose to mimick him to some extent by watching his top class PvP/colo vids like vs. top ranked Noirteuer and on his own YT channel."
soccerspirits,3dxh6o,TheJediJew,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:46:21 2015 UTC,"EBM is wasted on a penetrator since it's a line passive stone (unless no one else has an Ardor slot).  I prefer EBM in midfield anyway, but that's just my own opinion."
soccerspirits,3dxh6o,Moreni-to,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:39:04 2015 UTC,Yes it's better midfield but no one else has an Ardor slot :/  Edit : I'm waiting for Sammy to give her the sone
soccerspirits,3dxh6o,TheJediJew,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:41:32 2015 UTC,"Do you have Saramir? She's a decent enough midfield tank/totem and especially with EBM on board.   She could fill in for Meiran while you wait for Sammy.  I certainly would want that Teranox on Khirel.  Ninja edt: Although, come to think of it, Khirel does so much damage that the buff from Teranox will be kinda pointless. Maybe EBM is not too bad an option.  No idea what you'd do with Teranox then..."
soccerspirits,3dxh6o,Moreni-to,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:46:43 2015 UTC,Don't have Saramir but it could be a good idea. Don't know if it's better to have Saramir Ace as lastra said or to have Silla Ace.
soccerspirits,3dxh6o,lastra1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:57:49 2015 UTC,"Note that you can also use Silk as ace, she is not worse as ace, she may be worse as PvP player, but her active becomes really good with Jin."
soccerspirits,3dxh6o,TheJediJew,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:18:44 2015 UTC,Silk doesn't fix the EBM problem though. I wouldn't bring her in just for her Ace if Silla is already in the team.  Saramir offers both a good player and EBM holdability.
soccerspirits,3dxh6o,lastra1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:28:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I just noticed that it won't solve the first problem, sorry /u/Moreni-to."

soccerspirits,3dxh6o,TheJediJew,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:23:03 2015 UTC,"You don't have to use Saramir's ace, but I suspect it'll be pretty close.   The downside of using Saramir's ace is your midfield will be weaker compared to Silla. The upside is your attack and defence will be stronger.  You'd have to try both and see what you prefer as there's no obvious winner imo."

I have extra Elizabeths lying around and I want to ST as much as possible before Elizabeth is a special card.  I eventually want to make a mono-thunder team, I have Luka and Jury to ST too. So who should i ST?  Thanks in advance."
soccerspirits,3dxh6o,lastra1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:59:43 2015 UTC,"If you're really aiming to Mono-thunder, Jury is the one you will be depending on a lot, so I'd give her priority. Luka isn't best passer now and her EE is still unknown. Avn is best healer around, mono-thunder or not since you only thunder choice is Juno who is considerably weaker and heal is very helpful in PvE, STing him will make him tankier/safer to use. Yuri doesn't gain much from ST, especially when used as back totem and using her as front totem is not always recommended.  Since your team already is fully ST, then you probably have a dependable CM as well, so I'd give first priority to Avn, then Jury."
soccerspirits,3dxh6o,Azioria,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:39:41 2015 UTC,"In terms of usefulness, I think Yuri would make the most out of the extra 2 skill points due to all her passives being totems!  Since you do use Avnore occasionally, I would ST him as well before working on your side team units."

I took this chance to actually look around and there were actually two topics (this and this, note that both are fairly old and chances may have changed) that point out only 200 mill, so it's better than 300 mill, yay..."
soccerspirits,3dvkri,beedoebeedoe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:32:18 2015 UTC,"Well I could calculate the chance right now, but I'd need to know the chance of legendaries showing up in scout. (I've heard .01% and .001%)"
soccerspirits,3dvkri,lastra1,2,Mon Jul 20 07:54:42 2015 UTC,"This. And according to 3 months old topic, the ""big ass number"" was 292480."

It's simple statistics of multiple independent events. Don't know how anyone arrived at 200 million. Edit: That's assuming the .00103% chance is applied a single time to every scout, and not rolled for every slot (and just ignored for other slots if it shows up). If it is rolled for every slot independently your chances are even better. I don't know the algorithm though."

Which is is more meta either now or in the future? Leaning Kirin (also because Kirin was my starter in PAD but shes a waifu there....) but would like some advice.
soccerspirits,3dvkri,lastra1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:56:02 2015 UTC,"I'd say Elaine is better.

soccerspirits,3dvkri,nyoray,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:04:34 2015 UTC,How does pass effect work? Does it increase the pass stat directly like 20% pass effect and player has 100 pass = +20 pass? Or is it different? Sorry if i didn't explain myself correctly D:
soccerspirits,3dvkri,TheJediJew,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:38:52 2015 UTC,"Yup. The bonus given is whatever multiplier times the assistor's pass stat.  However, when the active pass says ""gives 180% of the pass effect"" it means an 80% bonus.  I'm not sure if receiving pass effect applies before or after the Base pass multipliers though. I'll have to test it."
soccerspirits,3dvkri,lastra1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:53:26 2015 UTC,Latest damage formula.  Total Pass = (Base Pass * 1.1 * (1 + % bonus Pass) + Flat Spirit Stone Pass) * (1 + Pass Skill + Recv Pass Eff.)
soccerspirits,3dvkri,nyoray,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:53:10 2015 UTC,"i'm bad at math, i get either big numbers or too small numbers x.x but thanks for the formula it helped a bit understanding the core mechanic :D"
soccerspirits,3dvkri,Dysoth,0,Mon Jul 20 06:39:41 2015 UTC,"Someone correct me if I'm wrong here, but let's say your passer has 100 pass, you use a skill that increases pass by 120% he/she then passes for 220.   That's what my observations tell me at the very least."
soccerspirits,3dvkri,AmoebaCel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:50:16 2015 UTC,"Someone did the math for this (forgive me if I can't find the source; it was in the comments of some obscure thread, possibly even the daily thread). Receiving pass effect buffs do not immediately multiply the pass effect.   Let's take Lucid's Solar Eclipse - it increases receiving pass effect by 250%. You'd expect a 1000 pass to become 2500 when it reaches her, but it's actually only around 1900+. The buff only affects the base pass effect of the passer, not the entire figure."
soccerspirits,3dvkri,Dysoth,0,Mon Jul 20 08:44:19 2015 UTC,"Oh, good to know, thanks!  I guess I really should shut up when I'm not 100% sure what I'm talking about :<"

soccerspirits,3dvkri,nyoray,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:09:34 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, but let's say the passer has 100 pass and 40% pass effect(10% assist passive, 30% skill passive ) , would that make its pass stat in a match go to 140? or is it an invisible stat that adds only when you pass?"
soccerspirits,3dvkri,Dysoth,0,Mon Jul 20 06:29:39 2015 UTC,"As far as I know it works like this:  Base pass + passive pass buffs (e.g. +50% pass) + line pass buff (like Kikis) are added together to a value that you can directly see when you check the players stats in a game.  So the 100 I mentioned earlier, that you see in game is: base pass + any passive pass buffs.  The active pass adds 120% to that.  I don't exactly know how base pass + passive pass buffs are calculated, but what matters is the number you see on the passers stats screen.   let's say the passer has 100 pass and 40% pass effect(10% assist passive, 30% skill passive ) , would that make its pass stat in a match go to 140?   So yes, it would."

soccerspirits,3dvkri,lastra1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:36:41 2015 UTC,"Isillia has more stats including damage reduction, but Lucian heals whole line. Off color they're on par, so I'd say it depends on your ace."

soccerspirits,3dvkri,lastra1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:47:21 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'd vote for Isillia, because Lucian has no boobs! Not like Silla has them impressive, but she has nice thighs instead. If you use Sammy as back healer, then you line line is safe too."

And what should I max ok Luka and Metatron? (skill-wise)"
soccerspirits,3dvkri,lastra1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:36:43 2015 UTC,"I suppose your ace is either Lia or Cynthia.  Jenuese is good in combo, that combo can be with Kirin, but you'd want to drop Luka since her speed debuff won't really stack with Kirin's brainwave and Metatron is an evil stealer. That will in turn reduce you damage with first shot.  If you chose Lia ace, Meiran could replace Lilith as ballholder/buffer, but she'snot too good at stealing. When using Lia ace, your choices are limited. Lucian doesn't haveEE, Tortoise is draw only and Jin is legendary. You may want to look for Kei/Zib for general porpose instead, but they won't be better that Leo until you EE & ST them.  Like I said earlier, Metatron is an evil stealer. Her skills make her deal plenty of damage to opponentaction bar when stealing and heals you team's bar when attacked, but her debuff is most evil. She has both legendarystats and skills, so you definitely wanther in top condition."
soccerspirits,3dvkri,ExilusNotus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:26:24 2015 UTC,Should I grab Isilia or keep scouting for Kei?  Current team here: imgur.com/niMkFes
soccerspirits,3dvkri,lastra1,2,Mon Jul 20 04:34:25 2015 UTC,"Isillia is more of a PvP PvE GK with her healing while Kei is better for PvP due to his active. Isiilia is also handicapped with her stone slots making her hard to stone up when you don't have Ermaltion or at least a Paradise of Light. She can't have as much as Lucian/Jin/Ronald/Tortoise or even Nerua because of those slots. While Kei is general purpose, you will want healing for higher PvE, which in turn is bad in PvP.  However, her beauty gives her 100 points, how much are those points worth is up to you to decide."
soccerspirits,3dvkri,Snapz89,2,Mon Jul 20 05:15:31 2015 UTC,U mean - Isilla is more of a PvE with her healing.

You don't get ANYTHING out of her insane passives (which is why she's legendary) that heal your whole team or take away action bar from your enemy.   I would much rather use Baltheon - Alkyde - Ravian, stick Metatron CM and just get rid of Silla. Silla is useless unless she's in the front. She's way too squishy to be LM. Usually I would suggest Alkyde - Silla - Ravian but Baltheon is much better than her. Just use Metatron Ace.   Also, you just need to focus on superbing and STing the rest of your characters. 8.8k TA is fairly low at Rank 94. You have three of the best legendaries (and 3/5 of the dark/light ones) so you're off to a great start.

BP farming on minion matches is ok and probably something you should do.  Both difficulties hand out roughly the same BP gains overall.  Boss match difficulty comes down to personal choice.

soccerspirits,3dvkri,theterrorblade,3,Mon Jul 20 02:09:54 2015 UTC,"You should really save up for a legend or a unique if you're going to spend dimension stones as they're the only way to guarantee them! The random 5 star box is really terrible cost reward wise when you could save up for something so useful after like a legend or a unique. Not to mention you get to choose exactly what you want too.  Hildegard is pretty powerful as a penetrator but she's not reliable when it comes to getting penetrated and surviving so you want to use her mid right (assuming you run some sort of thunder or rainbow team). All attackers hit for a truckload once you deck them out so what matters is what they do on penetration, totem abilities, and abilities that proc when you get hit."

Stick Kiki in the back with Jin to provide him more HP through both her EE passive and chains, and put Silla either mid for support, or top to give William penetration and attack power as a totem.  Also, you really shouldn't be looking or Jean or Sammy for your team. Judging from your current setup, you'd benefit the most by going Ardor/WW so you should be on the lookout for Lia."

I have yet to see and potential/value out of her. She just seems to be a weakling that is forced upon me and ends up weakening my offensive line, always getting the ball stolen and never doing any kind of damage to anyone.   I know she's a 5 star and I should be happy, but is she worth wasting any time on? She'd be the only whirlwind player on my team."
soccerspirits,3dvkri,Murol,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:14:54 2015 UTC,"Don't judge Elizabeth based on her performance as a colo helper. She's a good ballholder, her reflexes can reach 1K+ easily, and her line buff is pretty good. She's the easiest 5 star to get and get fully superbed. She's good in center mid, or as center-forward, acting as ballholder,stealer,and totem.    She drops off starting around mid game, so around rank 80 or so, but you're low leveled enough that she'll benefit your team. Pick 1 striker to focus on and use her in the frontline where she can buff your striker."
soccerspirits,3dvkri,MCserverALL,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:49:56 2015 UTC,"Well, knowing your team would help. Also, Elizabeth herself is not a bad unit at all. Her skills are great for assisting your team and she's easily superbed which is why a lot of WW players actually use her."

soccerspirits,3dvkri,MCserverALL,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:20:39 2015 UTC,"Easy fix here, switch out either Latios or Griffith for Elizabeth and her as a totem/stealer in the front for now. Why? Well you only want 1 striker in the front so that means you should be on the lookout for a passer as well."
soccerspirits,3dvkri,Heisou,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:48:56 2015 UTC,Should I leave her on the front right position? So she gets her bonus?
soccerspirits,3dvkri,Heisou,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:02:07 2015 UTC,Who would you recommend as a passer for my front line?
soccerspirits,3dvkri,MCserverALL,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:59:22 2015 UTC,"Well obviously Balth is the best for Lucid or anyone basically. However, you probably want to look for either Nari or Neraizel to give her the most benefit with Solar Eclipse."
soccerspirits,3dvkri,happyft,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:16:15 2015 UTC,"You only need 1 striker, there's no added benefit to having more than one. Of the three, Lucid is your best bet, as she's the best PvE striker and is a pretty good PvP striker since she has high crit to counter the crit-resist meta that's going on these days. You'll want to fill the other 2 front-line spots with a passer and a position buffer (aka ""totem""). Ppl like to use Neraizel and Baltheon, since those two have the highest passer ratings, which synergizes with Lucid's Solar Eclipse. Ppl like to use Kiki or Yuri for Lucid's totem since they provide huge buffs to passes to the line.  Elizabeth isn't really useful for your team since you'll probably be going with Lucid, and Lucid's optimal setup is very specific (see above). She's also a very good center-mid player, but you've got Beth, so ... yeah.  Your priority is deciding on which striker to use, and finding the optimal passer for that striker. Your cost is very limited early on, so make sure you invest in the most important players first. In this case it would be Beth, Striker, Passer, then front-line totem. (Most ppl will say Striker first, but I say mid-line attacker first because ppl forget that early on you need some way of getting the ball up to your striker.)"
soccerspirits,3dvkri,Heisou,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:47:10 2015 UTC,"Interesting points, I was on the fence about sinvesting into Ludic or Beth first. Though, from what I've experienced my front line is the weakest."
soccerspirits,3dvkri,happyft,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:57:57 2015 UTC,"If you've no problems getting the ball to your front-line, then by all means invest evenly in your striker and passer.  This is assuming you already know you want to invest in Lucid. I didn't start investing in my striker until Rank 55 or so -- even though I had already gotten Bora, Uriel, and saw a couple of others in scouts that I didn't like."

It looks to me you are gearing toward ardor/light team comp and your priority for that should be Sammy. I doubt Milky Way is a good CM so scouting Sammy gives you a very nice ace plus an awesome CM. You could use Lia for your backline but I don't see her high up in the priority list.

soccerspirits,3dvkri,Azioria,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:25:21 2015 UTC,"Definitely should EE Kei next. I personally don't like Yuri in the forward, due to her Attacker status, so perhaps switch her for a totem (Vero works pretty well with Hiro)."
soccerspirits,3dvkri,vrainsworth,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:37:01 2015 UTC,"definitely evolve Kei, then Anael or Dale.  your team is close to complete, you just need a dedicated attacker in backline. Anael is pretty good at attacking, but her defender AI can be pretty unreliable. For dark/light, Malcolm is among of the best choice for backline attacker. Mikael is also very good and also provides HP line buff which is never a bad thing for Kei.  for midline, I personally don't like Lilith (squishy, low reflex when attacked, and doesn't have midline speed boost). Once you find a backline attacker, you can move Anael (or keep Lilith and ditch Kevin, he's rather weak as well, and damage reduction stacks multiplicative so his buff isn't super useful for Kei) so to Lilith's spot."

Beatrice (ST, EE) Neraizel (E) Kiki (E)   Linmay Lia (E) (Ace) Hildegard   Magnus or Nerua (E) Yuri (E) Lucius (E)    King Jin (EE)"
soccerspirits,3dvkri,happyft,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:08:41 2015 UTC,"Mikael is one of the best non-legendary players, top 5 imo. If you haven't invested in Lucius, I recommend replacing Lucius with Mikael.  I don't have Meiran, but when I look at her skillset, I'd say her real use is in CoD where her active greatly amplifies your entire team damage, and you can manually stack up her passives. I don't think her active is as useful in PvP since (1) the AI isn't smart about managing spirit (2) most players die in 1-2 hits anyway, and (3) the AI doesn't know to stack up her passives.  I don't think scouting Meiran would be a waste, since you generally need an active like hers to progress in CoD, but there are other players that have the same kind of active, like Jacob and Iggy, and you could randomly get them thru draws and what not."

I mean if people thought logically and fairly those would be the only reasonable options. Then do something for superbs. I mean it's their fault for having no foresight whatsoever. Right when I saw her I knew she would be OP.

soccerspirits,3dwp61,DeviantSeoul,0,Mon Jul 20 16:24:02 2015 UTC,I believe that it was replaced by the dimensional crystals.

Not only does Kiki give 35% hp totem, but the Affection chain buff of 20% hp and def from having kiki on the totem is just so huge. If you can get Kiki, by all means consider her core to your team. She's super strong no matter what team or position. She can be used in the front as a stealer/pass effect dmg, or in the back for huge HP/actionspeed/stealing. I would replace Niarose w/ Kiki if you don't need her in the front 100% sure."

soccerspirits,3dtn6e,Baetrice,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:40:08 2015 UTC,"I personally wouldnt, unless you want to use Kei as a GK and Jin as a totem. I don't think it's worth having kei as a defender when you can add in another HP totem, or a strong backline penetrator. Why have Kei who only reduces crit by 25% when you can have a Nerua who increases HP Def by 20%, Crit and counter attack resist by 30%, and the dec dmg to ww/light by 30%. There's just so many better units you can have as another backline unit. That's just my thoughts though, you're welcome to try him out!"

My Silk is only 1spu, that's it, and yet she's quite useful. I've got her 5/2/0/5 -- narcissism + kiki and magnus and neza buffs makes her move first, even before my ST 4spu Magnus, and she'll activate her 40% team-wide crit resist and 6% crit resist/reflex totem, giving my Lucian ~165% crit resist. She also hits harder and reflexes more often than I expect for a 1spu player, she has good base stats.  But if you're not running a crit resist GK tho, she's probably useless."
soccerspirits,3dtn6e,Baetrice,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:29:52 2015 UTC,"I've seen Silk used in high level Korean PvP teams. Her value lies in her amazing Crit resist potential for her line as well as the team, she's a very defensive unit and if your GK needs more crit resist and you can afford to replace an HP totem for her; I'd definitely look into adding her onto your team."
soccerspirits,3dtn6e,kidnapkin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:02:00 2015 UTC,"Hm I see, well I still lack Jin so my Kei can use a bit more maybe (at 64% crit resist) Thanks for the info!"
soccerspirits,3dtn6e,Baetrice,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:08:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, 64% crit resist is pretty lacking, Silk can potentially add 85% crit resist(to the whole line, 40% to the whole team) if she gets 3 actions off(which Narcissism helps) and her active too. Personally my Lucian still gets crit even at 110% crit resist pretty often, esp when the striker uses their active shoot. My beatrice alone has about 180% crit rate w/ an active shot. So keep that in mind!"

Currently running          Beatrice EE Nari E Kiki E   Khirel EE Jeunese E Mikael E   Anael EE Leah EE Eden E (5)    Kei E     What do you think is the highest priority to EE out of the above?  EDIT: Just came across Nerua in my scouts. Do you think my team needs her, or anything in particular?  Also just recently acquired Cassiel, Lucius and Sammy. Do you think I should replace anyone with them and where should I put them? Thanks!"
soccerspirits,3dtn6e,Baetrice,3,Sun Jul 19 20:30:54 2015 UTC,"Here's what I think about your team. It looks like a mess aside from your frontline IMO. Eden, or Sammy put as your centermid as a good ball holder. Mikael, when he gets his EE, throw him in the back as an hp totem and a backline penetrator. Switch Khirel and Anael. Jeunese and Leah both don't have a place on your team IMO. Jeunese is really good in the frontline as someone who can shred the enemy GK really easily, hes a more of an offensive Kevin so he really excels in the frontline. Mid and bottom I think his usefulness isn't AS impactful. Leah is really strong at buffing HERSELF, but not so much anyone else. If you want to build a team around Leah, sure keep using her. However in the endgame where every single slot matters, idk if Leah is worth using still. I would definitely replace her w/ Nerua if you decide to scout her, which I think you should. You're in desperate need of some HP totems to prevent your kei from getting 1-shot.  Lucius is good as a midline side penetrator, but I don't know if you necessarily need him on your team. So to re-iterate. Front is fine, backline needs HP totems like Mikael, like Nerua or Yuri or Magnus. Khirel is a really strong backline penetrator and provides an extremely op global totem. Midline is okay, but replace Jeunese w/ Sammy or Eden. Leave Anael and Lucius or Leah as a side penetrator. ACE wise you probably need Silla or wait until a ww/light ace comes out. Good luck.  P.S. I'd EE Kei, then Mikael, then Nari, and then Kiki"

soccerspirits,3dtn6e,SynthiaNguyen,2,Mon Jul 20 00:03:16 2015 UTC,"I'm able to scout Anael, wondering if she is good for Ardor/light.   http://imgur.com/kjPlsuv this is my team atm.   I haven't scouted jean nor sammy yet, so i'm still on the fence between ardor/thunder or ardor/light."
soccerspirits,3dtn6e,Hapten,2,Sun Jul 19 19:41:38 2015 UTC,"Anael is amazing LB, but you may want Tyler instead for that position. The reason is because Tyler and William have chain that boost 10% crit and damage."
soccerspirits,3dtn6e,happyft,0,Sun Jul 19 20:42:22 2015 UTC,"You've got Jin as your GK, and William as your Striker, which kinda means you should go Ardor/WW, which means Lia, who is actually very good for mid with her reflex and action speed totems and her ball-holding provoke skill.  Secondly, from what I understand, William is weaker than Sharr by about 25%, so I'm not sure if you want to commit to William. Maybe you'll pick up another 5star striker from draws in the next few weeks?  Thirdly, Anael is a bit controversial. I know she used to be top tier in the past, but the meta has shifted and I know some ppl don't have such a high opinion of her anymore. Probably 'cuz she's slow, and doesn't provide a reflex totem -- which is why ppl are favoring Metatron, Beth, Victoria, Milky Way in their mids.  I picked her up early myself and I liked her at first cuz she's a defender-type who dishes out a lot of damage with both steal and penetrate, can reflex, AND gives atk + counteratk totem. However, my team composition shifted towards high speed WW, and her incredibly slow speed made her useless on my team. So she sat on my bench for 2 months. Very recently though, I find myself needing a counteratk resist totem and an anti-metatron player for my mid, plus I got the Ignition Catalyst unique stone which offsets her low action speed -- so I'm using her again, and I'm once again surprised at how hard she hits.  Hope this helps."

soccerspirits,3dtn6e,Shahadah,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:29:35 2015 UTC,"I think he is the most underrated GK in this game. There is literally no mention of him ever and only a handful of people use him above Plat. I have only come across 1 maxed out Ronald ever so I can't assess his practicality in PvP but in theory, judging by his skills, he seems like a really decent GK. He has block, crit resist and damage reduction. With nerua, he can reach +100% resist + 15% debuff (only 3 points into that skill). Lucian only has base 30% crit resist + 3 slots for +135% crit resist with nerua and 30% max HP. So.... Lucian has Hp but Ronald has damage reduction. Needless to say Ronald is pretty meh in PvE.

soccerspirits,3dtn6e,celestialrq,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:11:42 2015 UTC,"how meh exactly ? I know he's not Zibroi Tier, but is he for example close to Kei's PvE performance ?"
soccerspirits,3dtn6e,Shahadah,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:41:47 2015 UTC,"I have never seen him in action but I imagine not very close to kei. Kei can stack Suicide and equip 2 light crits for the heals. Ronald has no way of healing and his damage reduction is lower, but not by that much. I don't think he's bad in PvE, but you need a good backline if you want him to survive in higher cod levels."
soccerspirits,3dtn6e,lastra1,2,Sun Jul 19 23:49:54 2015 UTC,"He can potentially reach almost 100% anti-crit including crit debuff, but not others' buffs. However, he lacks stats as well as other perks like Lucian's healing and his damage resist is far from impressive, except for active. In practice, I have barely even seen anyone using him at S rank, none in SS+, in the end he is a replacement for dark teams."

Even if you don't feel so right now, sooner or later you will have to get one. Active healing will give you a good edge in both offence and defence. He is also a tanky debuffer with good stats.  Also, I'm jelous of Metatron xd"

Anael is generally better in mid where she can penetrate and steal more often. Sammy is perfect ballholder/stealer/buffer for CM (PvP) or ballholder/healer for LB/CB (PvE). For PvP, you may prefer more HP buffs while PvE needs healing. While Zib has healing on his own, you may choose to get some HP or healer to support other players in line. use Avnore for PvE too, his healing can be turning point for both offence and defence. In PvE midling, you may choose two people to help the penetrator to do his job over them doing their own jobs. PvP support can be occupied by either Victoria or Linmay.  What you absolutely want to get next is Nerua. Her buffs are simply the best. Also you don't have many penetrators, Mikael and Asakura are fairly good, Leah and Anael can do the job too, you may prefer someone whose flesh and blood exist for penetrating like Lucius or Malcolm. It will be better for you future if you were to choose a color or two to concentrate on, but first get an adequate ace for that."
soccerspirits,3dtn6e,notwendigkeit,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:00:45 2015 UTC,thx a lot! I was hoping for Malcolm for a long time now but maybe i'll get lucky later on. I'm also tending to go light given the cards I already have but for now i still go with the silla ace on my rainbow team :)
soccerspirits,3dtn6e,lastra1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:09:59 2015 UTC,"The problem is you Trollventor since only Light/Thunder ace (Hiro) is also a striker. You probably won't want to waste progress you gave him and he is definitely not a bad striker, but it will be hard to use both in the same team.  Other than that, you can only hope to draw Nikita (she's draw only) who is Thunder/WW. You can also try getting Jean who is Thunder/Ardor ace, but not too recommended as player. Either way, Zib will be left unprotected and switching to Kei won't save him.  In all other cases, Lev will be off-color striker. It's not really that bad, but he will be losing a bit of his power potential. Just wanted to say when you choose color, you should be concious that he will be slightly at loss. With that knowledge, you can pick Sammy as your new ace almost immediately after you upgrade her and Kei to usable levels."
soccerspirits,3dtn6e,tofuchicken,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:40:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what the optimal team I could create is and I currently have Niarose as lead what would you guys suggest?  The other 5 Stars I have is Guin, Tyler, Neraizel, Enthia, and Jacob.           Victoria Linmay Ravian   Malcolm Niarose Lilith   Avnore Nerua Lia    Jin"
soccerspirits,3dtn6e,lastra1,2,Sun Jul 19 17:45:24 2015 UTC,"First of all, I wouldn't get too attached to Niarose as ace. Apart from forward pass and little above average ability to steal, she has little to offer. You would definitely do better with Saramir/Silk who are both Dark/WW aces, meaning that they will not only boost half of your current players but also second most important player in your team - Jin, who you will be using till the end.  It also may be strategically wise to  ignore positional buffs in mid and use Malcolm on the right, move Lilith to center and push Niarose to the right. The reasons are: Malcolm after penetrating can get a shot on defender potentially removing him and allowing you striker a one-on-one chance (double damage). Lilith is more suited for stealing and gets awesome team buff after successful counter and placing her in central position will give her best chance for that."
soccerspirits,3dtn6e,tofuchicken,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:12:47 2015 UTC,How does my front line look like? I'm thinking about switching either Victoria or Linmay with Guin or Neraizel. But I'm really liking the reflex boost Victoria gives and the reflex/crit boost that Linmay gives for my Ravian. Another note I should mention is that my Ravian is my only character completly supperb'd and at +120 stats and special trained.
soccerspirits,3dtn6e,lastra1,2,Sun Jul 19 18:19:54 2015 UTC,"For normal strikers, playing Guin + Nera would be delicious, howver Ravian is the last striker to be called ""normal"". For Ravian alone, having plenty of reflex buff/debuffs + stealers in line is one of the best ways to play, so no need to change it yet.  Unfortunately for you, Alkyde's two-week period to obtain has just ended and she was one of the best to partner with Ravian. Others (non reflex buffers) include Juen, Sammy or Silla to pull the best out of her shooting, rather than crit rate, make her shoot more to use her Gravity Down to the limit."

Still pretty new to the game and hit 30 recently and got Baltheon. I was just wondering if any of you guys were able help me with where to go from here? It looks like I might be going light/dark but I'd need a miracle to pull metatron. Are there any players I should be on the lookout for?  Thanks!
soccerspirits,3dtn6e,lastra1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:45:17 2015 UTC,"Same as below, you need a mid penetrator. For now, you can leave back to Leah while you move Malcolm RM, not LM, because both Mikael and Ravian are R-sided. While Maggie can penetrate as well, she needs crit rate to be useful.  Also search for healers like Sammy and Avnore for PvE and HP buffs like Kiki or Yuri for PvP. Anael would also be a good replacement for Elicia as stealer/sub-penetrator.  I'll also add that Ravian is the only striker that Baltheon might not be best to partner with. Baltheon has great reflex stat for stealing, but his active pass granting crit damage can be partly wasted by Ravian's low crit rate and he doesn't support Ravian's instant steal. However, since you already have Baltheon, use him, at least for now!  To end, I'll say that hopiing for Metatron will only throw you down to the pits of despair, since she is so damn rare. While your best chance other than throwing plenty of real money is scouting, someone counter that you need to waste 300mil gold for a 50% success during certain week (like all legends, she comes every 10 weeks, I believe she comes next week)."
soccerspirits,3dtn6e,Wahuh,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:26:46 2015 UTC,"You need a penetrator mid, if you can get Mikael put him RB and move Malcolm LM. Kei needs more HP so Avnore, Kiki, Yuri are solid pickups for the backline (replacing Leah)."

This is mostly because of the spirit it takes to use an active pass, plus the cooldown makes it unreliable on being up when you need it. On the other hand passive buffs are always up and attackers can penetrate whenever, unless they are super low.  That being said, Lia is a good totem. If your goal is indeed ardor/dark, she could be an investment worth taking. I'm not sure how you would guarantee going that path though since you don't have Elaine and you never know if you ever will(sorry if that sounds too sad).

Since you have Hiro, Luka and Duke, Kei would be your best option since he can reduce damage with every attack he receives and take them better than what Ryu could (Alternatively, you could get Isillia if you cannot find Kei).  Since this is your PVP team, I would recommend getting a better CM. Duke would be a better option right now since he takes hits better. In the future though, consider Sammy to be your CM (Move Duke back to RM and replace Mimi with Sammy) since she has skills that can decrease the damage she receives and, in her EE form, can increase the action bar by 20% for the players in the line."

soccerspirits,3drzml,happyft,2,Sun Jul 19 04:50:24 2015 UTC,"I hate to tell you this, but Sharr is a better striker than William by about 25% dmg. If you're still committed to William, then yes get Nari, he needs crit badly.  That being said, you have an amazing backline. I feel like all you need is Yuri to complete 4man back-line, and your backline should be able to carry for a very long time and you don't have to care about your mid at all. You could also grab Kiki and replace Anael, and shift Anael to mid. But yeah, your Mikael will hit hard with that back-line, will have plenty of HP, and could reach 100% counterattack resist.  This is probably an unpopular opinion, but I don't think having the perfect matching Ace is all that important. I've experimented with all kinds of different aces, and I ended up settling on using a rainbow Ace (Silla) even though my team is almost all WW.

soccerspirits,3drzml,theKONSTER,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:28:33 2015 UTC,CoD bots have abnormous amounts of health meaning that Ravian's percentage damage on whole team is extremely efficient. Hiro is already a OHKO striker I dont think you need another in Sharr. Train Rav for backup she goes well with Balth(who doesnt? Balth too good) and Victoria as well(as Ravian benefits heavily from reflexes).

soccerspirits,3drzml,ragemader,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:43:36 2015 UTC,What is a good backline for Khirel? I plan on using mine as a backline penetrator.  I'm thinking of something like:          X X X   X X X   Nerua Khirel Mikael    Kei     Any suggestions?
soccerspirits,3drzml,Xegil,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:54:36 2015 UTC,I would switch Mikael and Khirel so Khirel can penetrate easier. With Mikael's reflex buff and Nerua's counterattack res he should have little trouble getting through. If you get any good stones with extra counter res bonus stats then throw them on him.
soccerspirits,3drzml,kidnapkin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:28:40 2015 UTC,"That seems like a good backline to be honest (unless your willing to post other units you may have for backline). Usually Khirel will penetrate through with ease only thing I'm still concerned with is that he is easily counterattacked even with Mikael's reflex buff, but if you have his active max then it still shouldn't be a problem for his role."
soccerspirits,3drzml,Fluffyknowsyou,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:39:14 2015 UTC,How much does extra evolution help? Like I have a beth who now at 6k TA sucks. Would I see a big spike in usefulness if she was evolved?
soccerspirits,3drzml,Hyaciao,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:17:55 2015 UTC,"It's more relative to what you want them to do. Are you using them for their effect or their stats?  Character like Beth are prone to be reliant on situation regardless of EE or not. If you are dumping her in CM she's bound to get killed regardless. This is especially true if the rest of the line aren't able to reinforce her.  Of course EE will always be better if you can afford it as you'll get more out of the character. But again, this would depend on the situation and how you are approaching it."
soccerspirits,3drzml,FilthyHamburger,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:54:24 2015 UTC,"A great deal, i believe evolving gives a 10% (base) stat boost? not only a stat boost, but skills upgrade. It won't push a unit over the edge but it does get them back up when they fall behind."
soccerspirits,3drzml,Anal_Llama,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:32:40 2015 UTC,"everyone gets different spikes with an EE. Beth unfortunately does not get that big of a spike. She shouldn't ""suck"" though. She's a very strong unit."

soccerspirits,3drzml,Azioria,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:26:07 2015 UTC,"Personally, I would skip her. Your backline is lacking in crucial defenders, despite how effective long passers can be. You'll find her again when your team is more complete. Look for units like Mikael, Kiki, and Nerua."

Eden is a great unit that is on par with many 5-stars, but this early on, I wouldn't spend GP on a 4-star.

soccerspirits,3drzml,Croilo,2,Sat Jul 18 22:42:12 2015 UTC,"She has already been nerfed. RIP 50% starting action bar, even though I still see infinite Milky's thanks to unique stones.  Despite that, she is still awesome at what she does.  She generates spirit, increases AS and reflexes, has 30% starting action bar, and takes reduced inflicted damage when attacking.  Pair her with Kevin or Dark Kevin, and you'll have something akin to a machine gun, especially if you can get either of the uniques that increase action bar on attack.  In the next major patch, people will have the option to recall a specified player for certain amount of time for compensation.  I believe Milky will be the first player in the recall list, as people used the anniversary package to get Milky Way, and some will feel like they've been cheated with the nerf.  Edit: OH YEAH.  Future update that will nerf action bar is supposed to come as well!  This not only affects Milky Way, but all other players that are dependent on starting action bar.  There will be an upper limit of XX% (was it 70?) starting action bar, and it will have diminishing returns with I think each consecutive moves."

Don't. Ask. So, Elaine's EE artwork was posted? Looks badass. Out of the things I could do with my 5*s I was considering Ardor/Thunder and Elaine could do well in such a build, I feel. I am going to stop scouting for at least two weeks. Cynthia was hell for me to grind for since I was starting from only 100 (after scouting Malcolm) on Wednesday and I'm so tired of seeing characters I want so badly when I'm in such huge GP deficits."

If so, do you get anything for finishing Hell?   2: Can any 6 star spirit stone evolve (with the 1% chance every 3 levels) or is it only specific ones? I only have four six star ones so far but I'm thinking for further down the road   3: I see the consensus seems to be that you should pour all your best resources into your striker first. I have 3 5* littres saved up for when I decide to pull the trigger, is Sharr good enough to warrant it? Or should I use them on balth (my only legendary) since it will be considerably harder to get dupes of him? I'm worried about using them on Sharr on the off chance I get a legendary striker in the future and regret it..."
soccerspirits,3dq35o,Anal_Llama,2,Sat Jul 18 18:44:38 2015 UTC,"Feel free to keep asking, no questions are stupid! (Except those asking BBall for units that give free superbs).  1). Nothing for finishing Hell yet aside from the Chapter crystals and stones. Something will probably get added. I personally don't like the amount of EXP Hell gives (ranks up) so unless you're near 100 for another unique I'd advise against it.  2). Only rare 6 star spirits stones can evolve (with the 1% evolution chance) into a unique. Look at the Player Book (Spirit Stone section) to figure out which rares turn into what. In terms of combining, any 6* stone as long as you have five of them at +15 can become unique, even if they are common.  3). Right now, the legendary strikers aren't good enough to warrant using them if you've already trained someone else. Sharr is a great striker right now (ask littlejoey or watch his PVP videos). I'd say the two most popular strikers in PVP are Ravian and Sharr right now. You can split the Littres 2-1. It's better to have resources into Sharr, but Sharr is also scoutable in the future. I recently made a new account and plan on keeping my Ravian at 4 superbs until my team is done and then just scout a dupe."

soccerspirits,3dq35o,Pillowesque,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:36:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for the advice! So in splitting the littres 2-1 should I give the 1 to Balth? My GK is isillia (i know she's not great but damn it i'm smitten, and with her EE she seems decent enough) and I figure if I'm eventually going to be needing dupes to superb anyways I should give at the littre to balth instead of her.  In regards to 1), you hit the nail on the head and if I hadn't already foolishly spent a bunch of money on this account I would probably re-roll myself since I leveled up far too quickly thinking it was a good thing and now find myself getting reamed in pvp :[ I'm only 16 days in and I'm rank 64 and although I can get pretty good streaks in the player controlled pvp option when the AI gets a hold of my team I just watch and cry"

The big question here is, DO you want to.  I started over from a Rank 97 (with lots of ST fodder) for a Rank 2. It was because I ended up getting Metatron (who I was more than willing to start over for). If you have a S1 legend that you KNOW you need to enjoy the game but probably wont get, then I'd say it's fine.   That being said, I'd say just finish Challenge mode and end it there. Rank 64 is not that high to say you leveled too quickly. You can still sit there and build up your team considerably."

I think I could consider an alt once I reach diamond league or at least the top 10 floors of CoD >u<   I think Balth is enough for me to enjoy the game, but if I could go back in time I do think I would have re-rolled the starting draws until I found a legendary so that I could have two. I think that would have certainly been nice.   Do you have any specific tips for not leveling while still improving my team? So far I've just been looking to scout good players for my roles and evolve them without worrying about superbing too much since getting dupes before finishing the team sounds silly.  edit: for reference, here's the team I'm using for pve atm http://gyazo.com/f8990a4a379ad160d9ea2ddeea066bb3 (I have sharr and the blackhole swirlies/lights + 5star swirlie to EE her but just need the normal spirits I can get monday before I swap her for uriel)   My biggest problem is cost atm considering I still have a bunch of evolves to do and I'm running into a wall when it comes to the cost of it all.

Always use ST on 1-1 story or finishing Challenge mode for the unique (the exp is worth the stone). Do Arena matches and Colo consistently. That's it really. You won't get much exp and you WILL level but very slowly.  Eugene isn't the best to scout but since you already did oh well.   Your team needs a new midline and backline. Cassiel, Jean, Jeunese, Chitose and Lia will probably not be in your end-game lineup.  This is a good team setup. I can think of off the top of my head. Also, if you love Isillia, who cares if she's weak, just use her. As long as you enjoy your team having the best GK (Jin) doesnt matter.  Sharr Baltheon Silla  X  X  X  Nerua Yuri Kiki S  Isillia  S can be a backline penetrator: Malcolm, Hildegard, Mikael, Bell, Khirel.

Based on how high that number is it wouldn't even make sense if using littres added them, does power up with swirlies add them? If it's exclusively using dupes hats off to you guys that's some dedication   edit: apparently I was misreading, 99+ is the highest you can get clovers.

soccerspirits,3dq35o,Anal_Llama,2,Sat Jul 18 17:25:36 2015 UTC,Most of us use 2* players from Story mode for Luck characters. Many of us farm 1-1 in normal Story mode for 3* units if we want to GP farm but not level up (and hence use stamina instead of wasting it).  That mode drops 4 different 2* characters. It took me maybe a day or two to get 4 99 luck units. I still use them to farm.
soccerspirits,3dq35o,Pillowesque,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:41:00 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming you just put those four in your defensive and GK positions on a good team and use that team for farming spirits and such? Seems like a solid plan I'll probably do that myself. Also I should make one of them the ace, right? Since the ace affects it more?  And are you referencing using 1-1 story mode once you already have the team of 2 star luck backline or using 1-1 story mode to acquire the 2 star fodder for luck?  I have been going back through free mode and doing the (initially glazed over) friendship quests (I already completed the crystal and gold ones initially) and I have gotten a fair share of 3 stars for gp fodder even without any luck drops so I can see the value in doing either, I'm sure once I got the team I would come back to ask where the best place to use them to farm gp would be anyways! :p"
soccerspirits,3dq35o,Anal_Llama,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:49:52 2015 UTC,"Well 1-1 Story mode is almost impossible to lose. So put them anywhere it doesnt really matter. In terms of harder matches, you would put them in the front-line or backline (not the GK position). Yes you should make one of them the Ace.  You first use 1-1 Story mode to farm them and GP. Then afterwards you just keep using it to farm GP. All of story mode (normal, not challenge) has the same chance for a 3-star, so 1-1 gives the least EXP, takes the least time, and costs the least stamina.  You can always do the friendship quests. I like to save them for if I'm really low on FP and need to rush GP to get a unit before the week is over."
soccerspirits,3dq35o,Pillowesque,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:53:01 2015 UTC,ahh good idea I will probably start but not finish the rest of the friendship quests on that note so it'll be easier to finish them when I scout a crazy good character with no time left.

This works with any unit so as you can imagine, getting a 2 star unit to 99 clovers then super training them to a 6 star is much more practical than feeding a unit with base 5 or 6 star duplicates or Littres to up the clover count.

I have a lot of problems in the back and it's hit or miss whether or not I can clear the floor depending on how everyone's starting action bar is. Sometimes they get 3 units in a row attacking and my units can't handle that kind of pressure.   My strategy is to keep passing to proc Mariel for damage and Linmay for heals and I penetrate with Kei to make sure he's the only one taking damage. Then when they get low enough, I let Linmay penetrate to get to mid and forward pass to the front and shoot. Hopefully I steal the ball back and if not then it's up to my back line to keep Latios from shooting. If I do keep Latios from shooting, I penetrate with Kei since their HP's so low from Mariel and then Khirel breaks through and I shoot twice getting me the win. If Latios gets a shot off after I take a shot at their goal keeper though, it's impossible tough for me to come back.  Here are all of my 5 and 4 star units.   edit: Some advice on floor 38 would be appreciated too!"

soccerspirits,3dq35o,theterrorblade,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:07:21 2015 UTC,"I see. Do you think you could recommend a formation for me to get to floor 40-50 once I get Zibroi to EE and ST or is it a floor by floor basis to determine what type of team comp I need? I hear Ravian and Zibroi get to floor 42 easily but when I tried using Ravian against teams with healers whether it was Avnore, Virgil, or Latios, they ended up negating my damage and I would either time out or die before I could close it out."
soccerspirits,3dq35o,Anal_Llama,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:47:51 2015 UTC,"Ravian and Zibroi are definitely cheese tactics to climb higher colo. There was a fellow here with a 6.5k-6.8k~ team with Ravian and Zibroi who climbed to 42 recently. Check out the daily help thread cause I forgot his username.  It's really floor by floor. He also had Jeunese which probably helped . CoD is all about looking at which units youre facing and planning against it. He seemed to use two long passers and a forward passer at mid. So I'm guessing he used Mira (iirc) or Avnore would work better to heal up, Zibroi just tanked hits and Ravian could go and kill them.  If you have Ravian and Jeun, you only need to hit the GK around 3 times with her before he'll die. That said, the only problem would be healers and Latios. If that's the case, you'll really have to depend on some RNG to make sure healers dont get the ball with 2 spirit bars and someone can prevent Latios from shooting. Even with Latios though I think it's manageable.  Just make sure to use more Long/Forward passers if you need to. And you definitely need a healer in a CoD team for the action bar regen. If you find that Zibroi is finding it hard to stay alive, put Metatron in the backline in front of the strikers. Also since you have Beth (I hate you) you can replace Mariel with her. Mariel is nice but honestly there's no point getting all of the backline low. You just need to make sure Beth doesn't get too low. Beth basically does a better job of Mariel, increasing your crit/reflex in position, giving you ANOTHER action bar regen for the team and penetrating through. You only need ONE person to penetrate through in the back, and from there you can keep ramming with Khirel or forward pass it up."

Not really sure what players I should be focusing on or what I should be looking for.

soccerspirits,3dq35o,Wahuh,2,Sat Jul 18 13:00:57 2015 UTC,"You got Bell, Eden and Hiro so Light/Thunder is a better choice for you. Lucian is a pretty solid GK unless you can upgrade to Kei/Jin. Look for players like Hildegard, Nerua, Veronica, Mikael, Silla etc. There's plenty of good players from both attributes.  Player position bonuses aren't very important, what's more important is putting your players in the optimal position for their role e.g. Hiro is a striker so you want him LWF/RWF and not ST. Sounds weird I know but if you put him ST you may have to shoot through 3 players whereas on the side you shoot through 2 max."

Or would my team be taking a hit on the whole? I have the materials to EE both but I'm worried having their two EE's won't offset losing 14 on two attributes for my entire team.   for reference if it helps my team is rank 64 and power level 6106, and if worst comes to worst I'm willing to wait the few days it will take me to earn ranks and get there by spamming free matches, I'm just starting to fall off to the point where it's a STRUGGLE to clear each story mode mission (I'm at story mode Challenge #66 atm) since the enemy lineup has anywhere from 1-2K higher rating than me :["

soccerspirits,3dq35o,DeviantSeoul,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:31:32 2015 UTC,"Plate means level 60, which for non legendaries is caused by super training (using 5 level 50 5* cards to sacrafice for your one to make them reset in level and be able to level to 60 from then on)  Generally if you have low TA, I'd guess you can cheese them with milky way, Jeuneuse, Ravian and Mariel. Least that's what I use to cheese certain bosses.  You can poke and hold a character's ""bonus"" spot and it will show you the stat changes. Note that this method works best for comparison if they are in a neutral ""non bonus"" spot."
soccerspirits,3dq35o,celestialrq,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:22:05 2015 UTC,"1- 60 2- depends on the boss, but generally a strong GK, a long passer and a strong Striker (OHKO) can get you through the easier difficulties. 3- if you click and hold over the position in the map, it should show you which stats are boosted (blue glow), the rest is maths, since the boosts differ from player to player and from position to position with the same player."

Jeun works pretty well in Auto because he'll use his skill on GK when he can and the other passives are generically strong. I MIGHT consider a stronger stealer up front instead if you have one though, specifically because Ravian might need some help getting the ball back."

And any 4 star GK if you dont have a 5 star GK already  Most of these should be replaced eventually when your cost and RNGesus allows you to.   Special mention for the rival Didi, which gives you extra spirit when you start so you can use Hiro/Sharr shot right away. She also generates spirit. She's also a leader which gets spirit.

He has a more damage reduction (75%!) and it's not conditional like Fuse Ro's is.   Fuse Ro has the advantage with base HP, but Leonard has tons of on colour HP totem options to make up for that.  Having said that, I'd put Fuse Ro directly behind Leonard on the Goalkeeper rankings. There aren't any 'keepers better than Fuse Ro who are worse than Leonard."

soccerspirits,3dpd6b,CKMo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:49:04 2015 UTC,"Personally, on my team I only have Eden left at fspu and lvl 60. She's my best mid player leading a 1spu Metatron, 2spu Jury, and fspu Elizabeth. Protect formation and Oracle's Will are both great passives, and Serenity makes her one of the best ball holders in the game. She doesn't hit hard, but she doesn't die. Even end game teams even use her.  Other good four stars are Valkia, Durahan, Clarissa, Morgana, Rosaria, and White Tiger as totems, White Tiger as assist, Mimi, Mira, Ere Ere, and Juno for coliseum healing, Jay and Fredricka for decent stats, and Leonard, Fuse Ro, and maybe 83AR Reto for goalkeeping.  Personally, I prefer Ami over the popular Sena for four star attacker. Ami's skills complement each other with 60% crit chance on penetration and 60% action bar heal with a crit. Pair her up with a Kevin/Jenuse and give her a thunder pen stone after ST, and you've got yourself a pseudo Milky Way when penetrating, but hits a lot harder."

You see, not too long ago, one of my IRL friends started playing SS. But clearly something was up, because not even four days had passed and he drew William. I implored him to start building an Ardor team, since he set himself up with a legendary striker.  Eventually he hit rank 30, and he got Bell for his free legendary. ""Nothing too out of the ordinary,"" I thought. ""He just gets a bit of a jumpstart in PVP since he has two legendaries.""  And then the ridiculous happened. Within one week, he drew THREE legendaries: Khirel, Duke, and Leventor. And that's when I got salty, because he had 5 legendaries at about rank 39 and less than a month of play, 4 of which were from draw, no less. To make matters worse, he thought it was normal to have 5 legendaries.  But then one day he was booted out of his account and it turned out that he didn't set a password. So he lost his 5 legendaries as fast as he got them. And on that day I learned that the only thing worse than watching your friend get 5 legendaries so fast is watching him lose them all even faster. He quit SS after that. Understandably."

soccerspirits,3do9f9,lastra1,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:54:16 2015 UTC,"Hilde is a beast, with right setup you can start calling her Hildegod.  She is great in combo with action bar/speed modifiers to use her Blue Devil to prevent opponents from moving for a while. For that sake, you will want even more speed/bar generation on her with uniques like MetaWill or EoG or blue penetration shones as well as dark speed stone which also prevents her from getting countered. You may sacrifice some raw damage for the sake of combo since putting in another attack is very likely to deal more damage including the real damage on action bars.  She also has good damage with high crit rate and dmg if you don't want to play her in mentioned combo. Even then, as an attacker she should be wearing blue penetration stone and dark speed stone. Add light crit stone to make sure she crits. With crit damage bonus, she can exceed Lucius in damage per hit, but Lucius with Soul Evolution can get even. Lucius has comparitively worse stone slots, but he doesn't need to worry muych about getting countered - with second attack he can steal the ball back."

For stones I'd think average attacker stones +Pen, +Crit rate/damage, I dunno tbh since I don't have her, or any Thunder unit except Cynthia, and I don't have good stones yet."
soccerspirits,3do9f9,lastra1,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:00:42 2015 UTC,"Lucius is Ardor's top attacker and one of the best non-legend off-color ones.

You may also consider going Ardor/WW or Ardor/Light in future, in that case Lucius is your best choice, but you won't really need him for rainbow."

soccerspirits,3do9f9,prysmae,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:54:42 2015 UTC,Not worth it. Get one and move on. Her art is nice service but that's about it. I made the mistake of STing her too. Dropped her after 3 matches for off-colour penetrator.
soccerspirits,3do9f9,EatThatPotato,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:28:31 2015 UTC,Hmm ok. How about on a mono-thunder team? She seems too be an OK penetrator from the rival matches. Or maybe my team was weak
soccerspirits,3do9f9,prysmae,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:32:35 2015 UTC,"She'll be useful till you get any penetrator.  However, I would advise against investing heavily into her. She's just a 4* filler till any 5* penetrator comes your way to take over.  Also, she takes too much effort to get max superb (i was incredibly unlucky), it's better to spend ST farming 1-1 for GP and just scout one of the thunder penetrators. Her matches rank you up too much at 2.4k exp per hell and 1.1k per very hard.  Overall, not a good investment."

soccerspirits,3do9f9,RotatedTriangle,3,Sat Jul 18 04:58:58 2015 UTC,"You might want to run Yuri front to max out William's counterattack resistance. In arena, you can penetrate with William, watch the enemy defenders suicide while William holds the ball, and then use active pass and active shoot for a 1 : 1 chance.   The whole point of William is to let the enemy defenders suicide as such. Ardor/Thunder is very good with William, you can use Nari support and Veronica totem to get Crit chance and also give him some reflexes that act like Yuri counterattack resistance.   Teranox's Blood is absolutely crucial for William as he has no innate crit chance. Elise ace is also helpful. Try to get the unique spirit stone Endlessly Burning Matter on your Nari to compensate for the lack of penetration power."
soccerspirits,3do9f9,stupidtrader,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:59:27 2015 UTC,"this was a big part of the thought process in a team with william, the main issue will be spirit stones though."
soccerspirits,3do9f9,RotatedTriangle,2,Sat Jul 18 06:12:07 2015 UTC,"William is a end - game striker that can match Leventor's active shoot damage with a normal shoot. His problem is that he never crits, and this is quite difficult to fix because of his damn triple ardor stone slots. I do think William is very strong once everything is set up(he needs like the best stones with the best options), but to be frank, atm he won't be strong enough to compensate for the effort.   However, if his crit rate gets buffed in the slightest(if theres an extra blue stone slot), I suspect he will be the best shooter in the game.   Dont hope for a light stone slot, that will break the game"

soccerspirits,3do9f9,prysmae,2,Sat Jul 18 07:09:12 2015 UTC,"If you run William, Nari is a must-scout since she passes crit chance.  Also, ardor/thunder forces you to use Jean's ace. He's isn't a very good player, needing a long game to ramp up and 2 spirit bars to long-shoot."

soccerspirits,3do9f9,lastra1,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:27:27 2015 UTC,"You may change Hilde with Bell. Reason is your def has good overall reflex and with Bell's reflex buff will make them all good for counters and with superior speed, they are likely to do that before opponent shoots, otherwise you will need to steal with damage.   Other reason is that Luka + Cynthia speed debuff combined with Blue Devil can do evil things. Hansha does that for high level colo.  Not actually saying it's better or worse since you would lose crit rate for Cynthia and you mid reflex isn't excactly shining. Hilde in combo with those three is not bad either, but I think it's worth a try."
soccerspirits,3do9f9,Anal_Llama,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:09:22 2015 UTC,Id use Jury or Eden at CM instead of Luka and switch Veronica with Silla or Kiki if you want a strict ww thunder
soccerspirits,3do9f9,prysmae,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:42:58 2015 UTC,"Noted. Silla or Kiki are better than Vero in frontline since charging song is useless for Beatrice.  Waiting for Luka EE, hopefully she gets a higher pass effect, freeing up Neraizel, and just shuffling her to SS."
soccerspirits,3do9f9,theKONSTER,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:04:53 2015 UTC,"You'll probably want a different CM instead of Luka since she can be pretty damn squishy. If you have Jury she is great, if not Eden or maybe Guineviere. Move Hilde around so that she is on a side instead of middle.   Edit : Forgot about Kiki. You should put her instead of Magnus since Magnus' Dark/Ardor damage reduction won't help that much for Nute."
soccerspirits,3do9f9,prysmae,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:13:22 2015 UTC,"Idea of Luka CM was to get passes off (Icy road + mega blizz) because the mid line is focused on breaking through. Jury is a great ball holder no doubt, but without a HP totem, I'm not sure how well that works out.  Idea of Hilde in back-mid is to steal/penetrate all positions in line.  Though this is all speculative."
soccerspirits,3do9f9,theKONSTER,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:20:38 2015 UTC,"The reason you want to put your penetrators on sides is so they can penetrate vs 1 defender, not 2. Unless you check their team to see if they have their extra player at their defense line,  there is a chance Hilde runs into 2 defenders, cutting down the damage Hilde gives and also increasing chance of counter attack. Also Attackers generally aren't good at stealing, you should have a defender or leader do that instead."
soccerspirits,3do9f9,theKONSTER,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:52:40 2015 UTC,"Thoughts on Hildegarde ace? With my rainbow team she seems to be the best option for an ace over Veronica and Kiki.

Alkyde Veronica Ravian   Anael Jury Hildegarde   Kiki Nerua Bell    Isillia     I plan on getting Cynthia when possible, but until then whose ace should I use?"
soccerspirits,3do9f9,lastra1,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:15:38 2015 UTC,"Check up Isiilia Ace. With healing nerfed in PvP, she might be even better than Silla. Not sure about PvE.   Rather than Cynthia, you may want to get Silla, who is reigning queen of rainbow aces and one of the top reflex players with plenty of utility. Cynthia is about ""above average"" class tied with Mikael, Baltheon, Khirel or Malcolm."
soccerspirits,3do9f9,theKONSTER,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:10:53 2015 UTC,"I understand why Silla is good, personally I think her ace is kinda OP. I wanted Cynthia though so I can have chain effects on Bell and Hilde both, I think it would make her considerably stronger. Also, in cases I start with the ball and penetrate to front, most of the time I don't have enough spirit to use Ravian active, hence why I want Cynthia's leader generation."
soccerspirits,3do9f9,vrainsworth,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:54:31 2015 UTC,"Too conditional and doesn't really help the team much. It doesn't affect steal (no boost to Ravian's multi hit; also pretty much useless ace if you lose the coin flip). The units that are supposed to penetrate (Hildegard, Bell, Anael to a lesser extent) can already do their job very well without an attack ace (i.e. Silla ace). The units that can't penetrate well (Kiki, Jury, Nerua) still won't hit hard with that ace.  I would go for either Jury, Nerua, or Isillia ace."

Sometimes it's not worth putting points into midline attackers if said attacker has no problem breaking through and the 0.5 bar can cost you an active pass/shoot."

Hiro is a good light striker and also an awesome light/thunder hybrid ace. Sammy can go light/ardor as well.

It usually takes a while to get the cycle going but it comes to a point where Kirin stays at maxxed focussed thunder(60% crit and crit damage) whilst kiki and Nari bring the ball back and the Jin can't do shit about it

At 1 stack with Nari pass my Kirin has 200% crit rate (3 crit stones) but it is not enough against 115% crit resist Jin + -30% crit debuff from Overwhelming. Also can't put a dent on Turtles, and sometimes very well built Isillia.   Yes I do get a win from counterattacking then active pass to a lone GK, but in league its too much of a gamble and a loss can subtract you more points than the last league you won."
soccerspirits,3do9f9,Hikki13,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:20:48 2015 UTC,"Kirin is an amazing striker. Sadly though he needs proper support to really shine. I'm rank 77 and I'm just now finally reaching the point where my Kirin does some real work.  Kirin's passives all work really well together. I run him alongside Jeneuse and Lilith. With the whole plan being shoot and steal it back while their damage is still nerfed. Ace's for Kirin are pretty limited. He needs reflex on his team to help him steal and get the ball back to him so you are stuck looking for Silk or waiting for the Qiyou boss to come back.  From my experience Kirin is really sub-par to average at colo but shines in PvP with the correct setup.   When it comes to selling or keeping 4s it depends. I have a decent amount of space to keep extra cards so I keep a lot of 4s to finish character chains for dimension stones. If you don't have the space you can sell them. Durahan is good for Kirin early if you are hurting on cost because he gives a lot of crit%. Never sell your 5*s just level them and use them as super training fodder for your end game cards.  Should you get him? Ehhh it really depends on you. You have Malcolm who is an amazing penetrator, and Veronica who buffs a lines reflexes and crit so you could set up for WW/Dark. On the other hand Shu is your legendary and you already have Lucian as well so you could go for some kind of Ardor combo. With what you have you aren't really locked into anything unless you just want to go rainbow with Silla. If you are going to use Silla as your ace and go rainbow for endgame then no, do not scout Kirin as he needs a fairly specific support group.

The Concept is nice and work in some game like Knights n Squires but i dont see the point in Soccer Spirits. Way more complex than that putting into account we have PvP, Colosseum, Superb Boss, Seasonal Boss and much more different type of match in this game:s"
soccerspirits,3doivm,KakkoiiAline,4,Sat Jul 18 01:38:19 2015 UTC,This is as pointless as I figure it would be.  Almost as bad as people wanting perfect 5* draws or legend boxes for nothing. It's better to not speculate dude.
soccerspirits,3doivm,Locketpanda,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:27:36 2015 UTC,I always thought it would be cool if a raid boss was one massive entity rather than a team of players - so maybe like you fight the bosses' tentacles (which can move from line to line) or something funky like that. Maybe the goal isn't even to score. The current stage types can get boring
soccerspirits,3doivm,Mikullandjello,3,Sat Jul 18 03:39:02 2015 UTC,"Would have to keep it at least soccer themed if it wasn't specifically the goal to score.. there are literally hundreds of other CCG/TCG crappy RoB clones out there if you just want to collect cards and throw them at a single enemy; if you really do get bored with soccer spirits, don't try to turn it into one of those others.. just go play one of them for a bit instead."
soccerspirits,3doivm,ShengrenR,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:41:16 2015 UTC,"No obviously it would be soccer themed, and I'm not suggesting it become anything like RoB.

I really see very little excuse for them other than to string the users along with what content they do have in the hopes of making as much off as little new as possible. Dunno how others feel, but me.. I'm still waiting for something that justifies it being called season 2.. all I've seen that's s2 are new legendaries without EE, super bosses.. and the option to pay your way up the ladder through the dimension shop (that some people still wrongly think replaced mileage).. well over a year of the game and neither ardor nor thunder have a single EE GK option.."
soccerspirits,3doivm,ShengrenR,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:26:31 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree that Season 2 bringing change is just an illusion. Most people are just too hooked on the idea of attainable legendaries (and free legendaries) to realize they actually took away alot from us and gave barely anything. That and also the weekly ""EE's"" (waifus) is quite the motivation for the majority of people playing this game lol.   On GK's... I'm personally actually had hoped they would change things up a bit between elements. Instead of giving everyone a useable GK, striker, defender etc, I had wished they would play on each elements strengths more drastically. Like if Dark could become completely reliant on debuffs, Whirlwind on action speed, thunder on raw offense (hence no GK) -- I feel like then people would actually devise interesting teams, and not just efficient teams. But I suppose with the nature of draws and all that, it might not be fair to some."

I was aiming for some mono Thunder with Kiki and maybe Vermillon Bird as splash.  Until now I was playing :          Vann Luka Kiki   Bird Eden Maggie   Meg Bell Marilyn    Mute     And I got : Lucid / Avnore / Mariel / Mira / Uria + I scouted Hildegard.  I'm thinking about :          Lucid Luka Kiki   Bird Eden Hildegard   Avnore Bell Mira    Mute     From what I've read Lucid over Vann is probably meh, but I really don't like Vann.   I'm not sure about Hildegard but since I already have Bell in defense (she's a beast), I guess it's better to stick her in the middle.   I went with Avnore and Mira in the back since my Mute is pretty bad (lvl 40, but still...), and I haven't seen much of Mariel so I can't really tell if I should play her. (maybe I should drop Bird and let her in ?)  I'm rank 44, so I'm aiming for Colosseum, but I'd really like to start building a PvP team at the same time.  Am I doing anything stupid ?  Can I keep going for my mono Thunder or should I forget about it ?  How badly do I need a new goalkeeper ? Can I keep Mute for a while ?"
soccerspirits,3dlydf,Wahuh,2,Fri Jul 17 20:21:29 2015 UTC,"Your team looks pretty solid with what you have now and you can definitely go mono thunder.

Pls advise me on my team formation and who to ST :)  Here's my PvP team          Bea ST x3 +120 Neza ST x5 +120 Silla +24 (ACE)   Enthia ST x3 +28 Milky ST x1 / Kevin Linmay   Saramir Silk x1 +3 Magnus x4    Lucian x3 +38     I'm still climbing Plat league with 1658 points right now. I don't think I can get Diamond right now. Arena isn't a problem.  My only unique is IC (on Kevin). I've got 5.5mil gold tho, and I'm 14 power levels away from making a Dark or Light combination unique. I'm probably going to do a Light combination since I've got a lot more Light slots than Dark slots on my players.  Notable players I have on my bench are Anael x2 EE, Yuri x1 EE, and Kiki ST x1 +84, but only evolved -- will be able to EE her this Sunday.  So right now I've got an anti-crit back-line setup, but it feels inefficient and a bit light on HP, and it doesn't have a true attacker (Magnus usually gets the job done, he's quite strong at 4spu, but he rarely pushes thru mid). Right now Lucian dies in 3 shots (assuming no crits, since he gets 148% crit resist).  I'm thinking about going with Yuri, Magnus, Kiki, which would be a ton of HP, speed and breakout power, but taking out Saramir and Silk would be losing around 76% crit resist for Lucian (who's at 72%, which I could get to 93% if I power up all my +9s to +15). In this case, I would ST Yuri.  I'm loathe to take out Enthia from my mid, because she one-shots everybody and takes out the defender in front of Beatrice a lot of the times too for an easy OHKO. Linmay is pretty crucial for the reflex and crit. Milky + Kevin wins against any mid that isn't Jury (she beats most Metatron's too).  That being said, I'm considering taking out Milky + Kevin and putting in Anael with IC. In that case, I would ST Anael.  Or I could just keep my setup as is and ST Silk.  WHAT DO I DO -- the more opinions the better :D"
soccerspirits,3dlydf,vrainsworth,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:33:26 2015 UTC,"Lucian with only 25% HP totem and a non-HP ace is just asking to be killed. I'd suggest taking out Silk for Kiki. Yuri won't push through mid either (because low damage) unless you have her max superb and good stones. Kiki + Magnus + Nerai speed is a very fast backline and with a bit investment Kiki can KO strikers. Saramir can stay, she's useful.   Personally I don't find Milky + Kevin combo useful in diamond (maybe in plat still good?) because more than half the team either runs Jury or Metatron mid (killing Metatron isn't a problem, the problem is the buffed action bar to the backline; if Metatron team runs strong speed line - Avnore + Alice + Kiki, then gg). Anael with IC is actually good, and can pen through if she has decent superbs. I'd look for a Lia to replace Kevin if you plan to put in Anael."

soccerspirits,3dlydf,theterrorblade,2,Fri Jul 17 16:44:11 2015 UTC,I think you need 2 more on top of the penguin you're trying to evolve. Like when you evolve a Littre you need 1 + the 4 that it says you require when you try to evolve making it 5 total.

soccerspirits,3dlydf,Pillowesque,2,Fri Jul 17 17:47:30 2015 UTC,"Noob question: A pass specialized spirit's active usually has transfer 1xx% of pass effect and xx% of (attribute), I initially thought it was of THEIR attribute but looking again that doesn't make sense.   For example, luka at lvl 50 with no evolve and her active level 5 has [Pass] Transfers 160% of pass effect and 20% of penetration power, but the card I'm looking at has 2.0% penetration. Does that mean it only transfers .4% of penetration? It can't mean that... or no one would use it.   Based on this I'm assuming my Baltheon's active also transfers a flat amount of critical NOT based on his? If this is the case I've been using the craaaazy wrong spirit stones lol... I thought I was being so clever using critical damage enhancing spirit stones so he would transfer more of his -.-'   After typing this all out it seems logical but I'd love for an experienced player to point me in the direction of an article on this (if there is one) or to confirm/deny thanks!"

soccerspirits,3dlydf,SoccerHeli,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:53:23 2015 UTC,"Isillia    The PvP meta atm is heavily geared towards crit resist as that cuts most strikers damage by a lot and Isilla provides much more of that than Kei. Stones are her only problem, as she has  3 yellows which limits her builds. For very late game you may want the unique stone Ermaltion but for now I think she's good where you're at.   For PvE there are two important things for a Keeper: Sustain to keep from dying and ability to attack to penetrate lines. Again I think Isillia will edge out Kei in both these areas if she is max superbed."

soccerspirits,3dlydf,TheJediJew,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:12:47 2015 UTC,"Sure. Always happy to help.  Glad to hear that you're working on Sharr. That was good advice and should be your first priority. Uriel just can't cut it anymore unless you can get Will of Metatron - and even then I believe she's suffering these days.  Your backline looks fine, although you could use a penetrator to help you bring the ball forward. Yuri (I assume that's who ""Yui"" is :P) is ok at that but really not amazing. You'd be better off with Nerua, Yuri and one of Cynthia or Hildegard.  Your midfield needs help. Bring in a penetrator (whichever of Cynthia or Hildegard you didn't use at the back), put Zibroi in the centre to hold the ball and Lilith on the left as a couter-attacking specialist.  You don't have a lot of totem options for midfield which is a pity, but this selection should do you pretty well until you do.   So:          Uriel Baltheon Jeunese   Lilith Zibroi Hildegard   Yuri Nerua Cynthia    Isillia"
soccerspirits,3dlydf,Pillowesque,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:23:30 2015 UTC,oh i'm an idiot t.t I meant Lia! yui = lia haha (been watching a little too much K-on! recently ;v; ) I've been using her to get the ball to the frontline in dire situations and her passives are great.  Thanks so so much for the advice I'll definitely try out your lineup once I get the correct people leveled and evolved. Yeah the most lacking part of my lineup atm has definitely felt like my middle since if I can get the ball to the front Jeunese's active --> pass --> pass --> baltheon active --> uriel active has been 1 shotting almost all the GK's up to floor 20 in colosseum and chapter 65 of challenge mode without them getting to move but I'm starting to fall off and I can feel it.  oh last thought I've been using Baltheon as my ace but with the new lineup is there someone else with a better one? 25% crit sounds really good on paper but I'm pretty new to the game it might be over-rated
soccerspirits,3dlydf,TheJediJew,2,Fri Jul 17 12:52:50 2015 UTC,"Lol. No worries man.  I would want Lia in Lilith's spot in midfield. I would want to get that speed debuff asap, certainly before taking a shot which you'd have to wait for if she's at the back. It's a waste of her long pass, but such is life I guess.  Crit rate is all the rage in the current meta. Sooo many people stack crit resist on their goalkeepers and backlines that you can't go wrong with it. I can't think of a better ace that you have available off the top of my head, but I'll get back to you when I've got some time to think about it."

One small thing I'd change is put Cynthia and Hildegard behind one another. That way when Cynthia breaks through from the back she'll hit the same target as Hildegard and make it that little bit easier to break through midfield.  The general advice for all forms of player upgrading is to do it in the following order: Striker > Goalkeeper > Penetrators > Assistor > Totems > the rest. That's the order of importance to your team. Follow it for evolving, superbing, Special Training, swirlies and whatever else comes out in the future.

I've only been playing the game (albeit obsessively) for the last 2 weeks so any advice is appreciated. Thanks!

soccerspirits,3dk0hk,AmoebaCel,2,Fri Jul 17 09:03:19 2015 UTC,"My only advice to you, since you've come so far in the game, is to take your time and be patient with your team. Keep the Dimension Stones - they are an incredibly scarce resource. I can guarantee that a couple of months down the road, you will want them for something else altogether.   You've only played two weeks and have advanced almost as far as my alternate account which is rank 70 and is about five months old. You just need to take your time, do more draws and see what units you eventually get. Then power up the units you want to keep and voila - you're set. All it takes is a bit of waiting for a few months, if you're into that sort of thing."
soccerspirits,3dk0hk,prysmae,3,Fri Jul 17 12:33:41 2015 UTC,"You want a OHKO striker because they'll utilise Baltheon's pass to its greatest potential i.e. Hiro, Beatrice, Sharr. I would be going towards Hiro or Sharr (in favour of Sharr) depending on what elements you want to focus on. Both Yuri and Nerua run fine off colour, so it's up to you really.  Like Ardor and WW units (Lia ace)? Sharr.  Like Thunder and Light units (Hiro ace)? Hiro."

It's gonna feel weird not having uriel though I wish she was better I think she's v. pretty :)   If I'm going for sharr though I actually already have a copy from a lucky scout, should I still get a 5 star? In a dream world I'm looking to finish out my weakest area (mid) with a duke+mikael so should I scout the mikael? Or would it be more worth it to save dimension stones? I feel like it's probably not worth the dimension stones if I'm not buying a striker/gk based on the stuff I've read here.  (also suuuuuuuuuuuuuper lowkey like I said I'm on my 15th day I have 2 really new player questions: first, do my dimension stones reset when the timer finishes like my season (boss) points? and also the first 14 day rewards were considerably better than the check in rewards I just started getting... after 28 days do I get the 14 day rewards back or is it just going to be like this from now on?)"
soccerspirits,3dk0hk,prysmae,2,Fri Jul 17 09:45:36 2015 UTC,"If you want to go ardor/light, Sammy is a must-scout for her ace.  I'm not sure what you're saying in the 2nd part. Are you saying you already have a Sharr and another one has shown up in scout? (Only scout duplicates AFTER you've completed your team).  Yes, Mikael is a great choice. He goes ANYWHERE (front,mid,back). I suggest saving your dimension stones and aiming for the legendary choice (900). You get Dstones from completing chain quests (player card story) and other events like fortnightly rankings.  Dstones don't reset, they sit in the account until you use them.  The new player / returning user rewards only happen if:  a) you are a new player b) you haven't played the game in 21+ days and are now returning to it. Hence, you can trigger these rewards again if you don't log in for 21 days.  Note: Playing the game regularly for 21 days is more rewarding than not playing at all obviously."

He works as a good reflex and speed totem there even though his healing tanks in PVP.   For PVE he's good at the back. Zibroi is also a good colo goalkeeper due to his self healing buffs.

I dropped him in favour of neraizel but if I'm goig to use Dark I might as well throw him in instead of William  So.. No Hilde?"
soccerspirits,3dk0hk,TheJediJew,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:22:03 2015 UTC,":D  Pretty much, yup.  You do need a penetrator at the back so Hilde does have a place on your team. You also have two different options with different tactical strengths and weaknesses.  If you put Hilde at the back (dropping Sharien and moving Mariel central) then you get to keep the reflex hell midfield you've just put together (Zibroi's 1k base reflexes +25% buff from Mikael and -25% to opposition from Avnore). I run a very similar midfield to this with Malcolm at the back where you would put Hilde.  If you put Hilde in Midfield then Kei will get a bigger HP buff from Mikael and Hilde runs less of a risk of counterattacks from trying to break two consecutive lines.  Oh and don't use Vitos. He's ok, but no more than that. William is amazing if you can get him critting."

Durahan is a decent enough totem if you need crit rate (which Beatrice doesn't).  You're doing pretty well. Still early days of course, but Beatrice, Nari, Silla and Beth are all end game players. Morgana and Clarisa are also two of the few viable (if uncommon) end game 4 star players (I use Clarisa myself :3)."

If you really like her better you can use Beatrice instead of Sharr for your striker, but honestly it would be a downgrade.  With her recent EE buff Sharr is just stronger than Beatrice right now in every way except for the cost of her active shot.  Durahan is a much worse crit totem compared to Milky Way, so he's not useful to you either.  As for what you are already running, my one suggestion for what you can change immediately is swap Meg for White Tiger.  White Tiger brings Icy Road to the line, which will give you a serious speed advantage combined with the action bar on pass from Silla and Beth's action bar on penetration."

soccerspirits,3dk0hk,randomlyWat,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:26:41 2015 UTC,"So my frontline is feeling absolutely overwhelmed by any backline that is a bit bulky at the moment.  Nerua's 30% reduction against WW and the current crit resist craze is diminishing my ability to just kill nowadays.  My frontline consists of Beatrice (EE/5SPU/ST), Nari (EE/4SPU/ST) and Kiki (EE/0SPU/ST).  I'm certain a lot of my frontline's inefficacy comes from my very meh stones on Beatrice, which consist of a 6* crit damage WW stone, a 6* speed Dark stone, a 6* Penetration Thunder stone, and a 6* speed WW stone in the prism slot.  I realize the speed stone in the prism is pretty bad, but it does have 23% receiving effect on it as a bonus stat.  Nonetheless, I'm in the middle of upgrading a 6* WW crit damage stone.  Any alternate advice, anyone?"
soccerspirits,3dk0hk,TheJediJew,2,Fri Jul 17 05:00:23 2015 UTC,"I'd say Nari is your problem. Beatrice already has plenty of crit rate so you want a crit damage assistor. Luka, Alkyde, Baltheon or Neraizel would all be better fits.  As for stones, use 2 crit damage stones, a ww speed stone and a penetration stone."
soccerspirits,3dk0hk,randomlyWat,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:18:59 2015 UTC,"Really?  I'm already having problems as is against crit resist backlines.  Like any Jin/Lucian/Kei that has crit resist stacks up eats my frontline for lunch because I end up having to eat away by like 400-500 damage.  By the way, as a Ardor/WW, I'd have most interest in Neraizel if I were to switch thanks to her teamwide buff.  Any big advantage she'd have over Nari that would make me want to part with the crit rate Nari provides?"
soccerspirits,3dk0hk,TheJediJew,2,Fri Jul 17 05:33:06 2015 UTC,"I run Beatrice myself and I don't have any issues. You should be sitting in the 120% ballpark just off her skills.  But then I do have a different stone setup to what I recommend above though (which is the generally recommended build). I use a Dark crit damage, a WW crit rate (more for the secondary bonuses than the primary), Thunder Incoming Pass rate (which also gives crit rate) and Glabaris.  But really Beatrice has the second highest starting crit rate (behind the PVP inviable Lucid). I'd focus more on pure damage myself as everyone else is going to be having more issues than you.  EDIT on your EDIT: Neza also gives crit rate to WW players, albeit only 15%, but she also gives speed and is one of the few (if not the only) assistors who is faster than a fully upgraded Beatrice.   You can also use the quick death strategy I've seen Little use where Linmay starts with the ball, forward passes to Neza who active passes to Beatrice for an active shoot in under 5 match minutes. This is possible entirely because of Neza's speed buff and spirit generating pass."
soccerspirits,3dk0hk,randomlyWat,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:44:12 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I'm confused there, how are you getting the ballpark of 120%?    I imagine that's where you're at with the crit rate stone and and the Thunder receive pass, but I'm only at 84.7.  Though, a thunder receive pass might be an attractive stone, now that I think of it.    Edit: Alright, I may just scout up a Neraizel, as painful as it may be to perhaps ditch a 4 SPU Nari.  Thanks so much for the help"
soccerspirits,3dk0hk,TheJediJew,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:58:19 2015 UTC,"No, I mean without stones.   It's 36.7% base (at lvl 60) + 30% from Soccer of Power II + 60% from Dragon Meteor Shoot = 126.7%.  The crit rate from her active will only add on her stats when used :P"
soccerspirits,3dk0hk,randomlyWat,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:13:55 2015 UTC,"Oh!  With the active, of course.  It's just that I'm finding an actual OHKO more and more difficult, so I wasn't even considering with the active.  Though, maybe I've been running into some buzzsaw backline teams, but those Kei backlines with Alice, Jin, and Nerua manage to debuff crit rate and buff crit resist to the point where I can't crit with a Nari active AND a Beatrice active can't save me.  Been running into those at least 1-2 a day."
soccerspirits,3dk0hk,TheJediJew,2,Fri Jul 17 06:21:11 2015 UTC,"Well put it this way: If a Beatrice - Nari frontline is struggling, then everyone else will be struggling even more.  With my stone setup I get up to 180% crit rate including active but without a crit totem. With Nari and Veronica (for example) it would reach 250%. So you can go overboard if you so choose :P"
soccerspirits,3dk0hk,randomlyWat,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:02:48 2015 UTC,"Everyone would struggle more, true, but my backline is like rice paper at the moment due to my GK being a 3 superbed Erica that I simply refuse to put more superbs on unless I draw a dupe.  So, while my frontline struggles, once the opponent hits my backline, I'm totally screwed.  So I guess for all the talking and asking about my frontline, in the end it's my backline that I really need to improve haha.  Unfortunately, RNG is cruel and Lucian, Black Tortoise, and Jin(though, he tends to avoid everyone else as well) all avoid me like the plague.

soccerspirits,3dk0hk,Shahadah,2,Thu Jul 16 22:44:12 2015 UTC,Well the obvious problem with Baltheon Ravian is that there is no way Ravian is going to crit against a competent backline. He's just going to be there for the pass effect and thats awfully inefficient use of a legend when you consider Neraizel gives pretty much similar pass effect. I think you should skip and look for striker like Beatrice that work well with balth.

And I accidentally used the 7 day 2x EXP boost today. So my gameplan now is to just rush to rank 30, trying to accrue as much GP as I can on the way. To do that, I really have to feed my 5 stars the penguins but I feel like everything changes once you get your legendary, so I'm hesitant on feeding them to units I might not use in the long run. I know I shouldn't have that feeling aha. (Since I'm talking about simply levelling units, I'm not even thinking about evolutions and ST :S) So which of my 5 stars are worth most investing into? Should I buy the 6 star penguin matches to get them levels? And should I try the 10+1 draws as a new player to try to get some more 5 stars and (I know its impossible) 6 stars?"
soccerspirits,3dk0hk,noarure,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:17:00 2015 UTC,"For now, save up your crystals and use them to draw as it's the most efficient method of getting new plagers at this point. You aren't at a point where the penguin match gold is really important; that becomes necessary later on once you've amassed enough 6* stones to make uniques.   Don't worry about who you're feeding your penguins to. EXP is relatively easy to get as the penguin matches come pretty frequently, and you should have no problem levelling the legend you get.   Blade, Anael, and Yuri are all worth investing into; I've heard and seen good things about the new Isillia as well."
soccerspirits,3dk0hk,fokxe,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:31:00 2015 UTC,"So don't do the Quest Matches for 6 star penguins yet?    And can you ""mess up"" skill points? Like do you get enough points in the end to max everything for a character?"
soccerspirits,3dk0hk,noarure,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:42:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I wouldn't do them until you have most of your team drawn and ready to be invested into. The 6* exp only really matters after ST, imo.  It's impossible to mess up skillpoints since you can reset them with gold (something like 7k per reset). When max superbed and STed to 60, the most skill points you can get is 18 - so you can max 3 skills and have the last one with 3/5 points in it or max 2 skills and have two with 4/5 points."
soccerspirits,3dk0hk,Xegil,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:01:03 2015 UTC,"Anael, Yuri, and Blade are all top tier characters. Isillia is a good gk for pve. Cassiel is a decent attacker, and lucifer a decent stealer, but both replaceable. Hope this helps."

soccerspirits,3dk0hk,Xegil,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:26:53 2015 UTC,"It's better to level them all up until you get replacements, since there's no telling how long it'll take to get them, and you don't want to cripple yourself early on. Isillia isn't going to be replaced by anyone except Zibroi, Kei, Jin, Hyunmu, and maybe Lucian."

My question is - keep my team as it is or should I try out some new players? Is there a player I should look out for that is a possible contender to use? Currently trying to get Lucy though. Also, who is most important to EE next?"
soccerspirits,3dk0hk,noarure,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:07:24 2015 UTC,"I see you're using a shoot damage/crit build with Ravian, but I think a reflex/speed build works better in PvE and the late game; and even if it doesn't (I'm not entirely sure) it's something to consider. Try running a Ravian - Alkyde - Jeunese frontline with a 5/3/5/5 setup on Ravian (5/1/5/5 before ST). Victoria and Lilith go well her too and neither of them really need superbs so don't be afraid to try out anything and see what works best. The extra speed and %damage from Jeunese and the active pass from Alkyde will really help Ravian get more shots off.  Hiro is really popular in the early-late midgame stages and he just eats Ronald alive. I'd look for an HP totem like Mikael, Nerua or Kiki to replace Lilith to help your chances in general.   Duke and Malcolm are who you're looking to EE next, probably Malcolm first but if you're fast you can get Duke done today.   Also, in my opinion two penetrators in mid is too much as Duke packs more than enough power to cut through the line on his own, so I would consider switching Malcolm with Lilith for now. As an added bonus, backline Yuri provides the CA resist that a low-reflex attacker like Malcolm needs."

soccerspirits,3dhmgn,beedoebeedoe,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:35:05 2015 UTC,Depends if you're going for continuous attacks or stronger attacks. You either wanna be able to steal the ball back and get it to Ravi for multiple hits or pile on the crit rate (because her raw damage/crit damage are already very high). So you either need good stealer + reflex pass/totem or crit rate pass/totem. For crit rate Nari or Milky Way work pretty well. Veronica's a great totem too but she won't get any stat bonus up front.
soccerspirits,3dhmgn,Poraro,2,Thu Jul 16 19:49:59 2015 UTC,Veronica does get bonus stats up front though. I have her on my team and if you put her up front in the middle she gets bonus stats. Dunno why it doesn't list that on the wiki though (non-EE).

soccerspirits,3dhmgn,randomlyWat,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:52:55 2015 UTC,"Roina is decent in niche uses.  She either wins the game for me or causes me headaches.  Her best feature is the -15% HP when she attacks.  I currently use her as my main midline attacker, and the real downside is the low HP.  Even with 3 superbs, ST, 30% HP from ace and 20% HP from Erica's buff, she only sits at 696 HP.    When she gets through the the backline with 500+ HP, she does 15% + whatever extra damage on the GK, which can be a lot of damage against a Jin you'd find in the part of the game when people start having full superbed GKs with tons of HP buffers in the back or it can reduce the HP past the point where Silla's Ace effect is no longer there. In these cases, Roina is awesome.   On the other hand, any time the midline has someone who does a lot of return damage when being penetrated, and Roina doesn't have much HP left afterwards, she'll not penetrate, and now instead you end up with having someone in midline that's a piece of paper and super easy to get through."

Lucius is 200% better than Lynia. With some investment, he is one of the strongest attackers in the game, whereas Lynia is one of the weakest 5 stars. Lucius is comparable to Malcolm in that he has Super Play, decrease enemy action bar/spirit, and a penetration power-up. Lynia doesn't have much. Definitely use Lucius over Lynia.  Edit: Really sorry, I'm stupid and thought she's a leader. She's actually an attacker. This makes her AI slightly smarter and makes her passives actually useful, but even so, she still lacks in stats."

soccerspirits,3dhmgn,kaldyra,2,Thu Jul 16 12:14:47 2015 UTC,"part of the reason is because Rudiel's ace is no match of any other mono/hybrid ace - many of them increased not only attack power but also such as reflex/hp of the same/hybrid color by at least 30%, so if you ace is only giving 40% attack power when hp is 50% higher, your team will be disadvantage in front of other mono/hybrid teams.  I have seen many Silla ace in the top global 50 list, so rainbow team should be definitely viable long-term."

soccerspirits,3dhmgn,Joey-Joeson,2,Thu Jul 16 12:38:21 2015 UTC,"Rudiel's ace effect is nice, but there are plenty of better players that can do her job as a defender and stealer better (like Kiki).  As far as long-term is concerned, it might be best to go hybrid or mono. A lot of rainbow players are using Silla's ace effect a lot more since her EE ace skill decreases damage by 45% if the player's HP is above 80%, allowing your GK to survive the first shot."
soccerspirits,3dhmgn,wingleberry,2,Thu Jul 16 12:17:09 2015 UTC,"Silla is probably the most useful rainbow ace, helps win early battles through the damage reduction assuming you don't get reflexed to death mid line and let's your GK survive most first shots without ace HP support. That and Silla is useful while Rudiel is not.  Rainbow teams work to an extent, but typically having a hybrid HP/atk or HP/reflex ace that covers the majority of your team is better. Some cards are good enough to run off color (Kiki/Nerua/legends like Bell etc) but really 30% reflexes/base HP covering a good portion of your team helps more than damage decrease. An attacker midline holding the ball doesn't care about it, but definitely cares about extra damage or reflexes, same for strikers/frontline trying to steal/brute force people down."

(legend pack isn't worth; if you see, don't buy)  If your team is basically complete I'd go with beginner + littre pack as most spenders that have a strong team still buy the littre pack despite its low value.

soccerspirits,3dfmid,TheJediJew,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:12:26 2015 UTC,"It depends on how you want to use her: Are you going for big damage or repeated shots.   If the former then you want crit rate and crit damage buffers. Alkyde, Luka and Baltheon are the crit damage assistors, but Nari is probably best for the crit rate. Veronica, Black Daisy, and Princess Meiran are the better totems.  If the latter then you want reflexes and more reflexes. I've seen people use Veronica and Metatron together as a frontline. If it works once or twice then you'll have the entire enemy team down 60% HP. But you're at the mercy of RNG.   You could also use a combination of both, but I feel you need to pick one and maximise it to get the best results."

I've been wanting her to replace Iggy in my midline, so it's perfect. The only problem is that I'm really gonna struggle to make the GP because I scouted Malcolm last week which completely drained it. In short: Cynthia replacing Iggy, yes or no? Maybe I should get someone on-colour? Don't get me wrong, Beatrice is doing her job damn well, but I feel like I might do better with Ravian or Leventor as impossible as he is. Anything else that's noteworthy?"
soccerspirits,3dfmid,theterrorblade,2,Thu Jul 16 04:47:05 2015 UTC,"I think that you have the potential to create a really strong mono thunder or hybrid thunder team if you wanted to go that route.    Cynthia is definitely a huge improvement over Iggy in general thanks to her global debuff. I think she's a good replacement for Iggy. I think you should swap to Leventor and go for some sort of thunder team. Ravian seems to be all the hype but when you get a 4 unit back line with some counter attack resist, it's pretty easy to run their front line over in my opinion. (Speaking from a low diamond perspective)   I'd do something like           Leventor Baltheon Iggy   Cynthia 1 Hildegard   2 Anael Nerua    3     For the 1 I'd recommend Veronica since she provides some much needed reflex and critical chance for your two other powerful attackers. For 2 I think another health totem like Kiki, or Yuri would be a huge help for your goal keeper. I prefer Kiki a little bit over Yuri since you already have some decent counter attack resist as well as an attack buff from Anael and Nerua. Kiki gives you action speed which might make or break an encounter in your back line since it could be the edge you need to block an assist trying to active pass to their striker. As for 3, it's tough to say but Kei is fine right now. However, with Raklet's EE and Nute coming out anyday now (hopefully this year pls bigball cmon man no more joke EEs like rasiel) you should save up some GP and consider grabbing one of them.   Also, I think you should consider Luka instead of Baltheon since he's a really specialized assist. He has poor action speed which means he has issues getting the ball before your striker to set up that massive damage. He also passes for crit damage which is really risky in my opinion since if you don't crit with your striker, the bonus does literally nothing. Later on you meet some crazy high critical resistance values too, it gets up to the mid hundred mark. He's an extremely powerful unit in other areas though. His reflex and damage are ridiculous which is good but he doesn't buff anyone besides himself. When you run into a 4 unit back line it doesn't matter how bulky or high a unit's reflex is, they're gonna get run over after you take a shot and give the enemy the ball.   I think Leventor is more of a utility striker with his Cold Heart passive and an utility assist like Luka would help him out more since she debuffs their action speed and gives you the chance to get steals off with Iggy."
soccerspirits,3dfmid,sodapone,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:22:42 2015 UTC,"For the 1 I really like Jury since she's an excellent ball-holder, but if Veronica pops up I'll look into her. For 2, I'm not so sure. Malcolm has been doing really well in my backline, being able to quickly get the ball out and with his spirit damage he's been able to stop assist/striker combos from getting out of hand. But perhaps more HP totems would do me good, and I'll keep an eye out for either Kiki or Yuri. For 3, I've always been looking into Nute ever since I first saw her in the player book. I mean, she is a counter to Hiro. So yeah, if her boss match comes around, I'll grind for her.  I actually remember having had Luka for a while. Don't know where she went though. But I still want to use Baltheon since he's a legendary and all. But I have noticed that often times I'm forced to make Beatrice pass to him since he's always the slowest in my front line.  I see Leventor as a bit of an OHKO and a bit of a Utility. He can do a lot of burst damage but also has Cold Heart being accumulative, meaning he's stronger every time. As for Iggy in front? That could work, yeah."

soccerspirits,3dfmid,Poringun,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:59:27 2015 UTC,"Thats the kinda new ""Luck"" system, you should see a clover mark in the top left corner of each card, the number represents luck, luck = drops an extra item,   the rate or chance of drop is dependent on luck, higher luck = higher chance.   The luck of your team's Ace player have an additional effect compared to the other team members, that's why sometimes people switch to 2* player as aces since they can be ""luck trained"" easier.  Luck training is basically feeding copies of the same card into ONE master copy."

soccerspirits,3dfmid,Wj1337,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:25:45 2015 UTC,"So I've been playing for about 2 months and I think I've got a pretty decent team going on. But I'm now at the stage where I am ready to start superb training the characters that will be main stay in my team for the long haul and need some advice on what I should be doing. But first, my team:  For all intents and purposes please assume all characters are fully evolved to their max capacity.          Leventor KiKi Luka   Eden Jury Veronica   Cynthia Yuri Avnore    Kei     On Reserve:   WW - Saramir, Silk, White Tiger  Dark - Zibroi, Asakura, Morgana, Alkyde  Ardor - Shar, Elicia  Light - Mikael, Latios  Thunder -Iggy, Blade, Robin  I think the cards I have landed on kind of put me towards a mono-thunder team. I've been just lurking and building my team to the best of my ability but there are some specific questions I'm looking answers for:  First, between Leventor and Blade, does either one of them out performs the other in a mono-thunder team by a considerably margin? I would prefer to use Blade (hoping her art will be revisited). Right now my Leventor is the stronger striker, but I'm thinking about the long haul so I can decide which one I should use my littres on.  Second, who should I be going for next... be it scouting or straight up buying to improve upon my team?  Third and lastly, I recently got Luka from scout and leveled her to the max and evolved her. I've started using her and noticed that she isn't passing as strongly as White Tiger, the passer I'd been using before getting Luka, did. Please keep in mind that all my 4* cards listed are fully superb'd and special trained to 5* (Yes, I did this instead of evolving the 3* litters, not sure if it's a dumb move but I'm now thinking it is). So I could see why White Tiger is passing higher raw, but does Luka's totem and passing penetration make up for it? Or should I keep using White Tiger?  And, of course, should I be swapping in any one from my reserve to my current line up to make it better?  Thanks in advance!"
soccerspirits,3dfmid,Poringun,2,Thu Jul 16 02:43:04 2015 UTC,"Leventor is good, there's a reason he's a Legend, so even if he's underwhelming now, he WILL get buffed, legends will always be top tier level because Big Ball needs to keep them there.  Guin, Nerua, Hild should be a priority, your midfield dont have any penetrator at all, it's your weakest position.  Luka is better IMO, the 45% action speed swing allows Kiki to steal more. plus penetration is almost always better than spirit."
soccerspirits,3dfmid,Wj1337,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:54:34 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice :D  I've been using Eden as my penetrator. Is that bad?

soccerspirits,3dfmid,ChoksNurriz,2,Thu Jul 16 02:18:00 2015 UTC,"he is the mono ardor head master!!! also he is a decent shooter so u could use him as a striker (some people already try it lol) ... but his main reason to exist is buffing... watever he do, he gonna buff till ur dead... his active is incredibly good and the pass buff is short but deadly but he still missing his 7 OPNESS so there isnt to much to say about it"

soccerspirits,3dfmid,SoccerHeli,2,Thu Jul 16 04:50:23 2015 UTC,Crit rate and reflexes with a crit damage active? Yep she can do a good job. I wouldn't bet on her second passive doing anything unless you're on manual.   Choi can be alright as a totem. Just there are much better options at the moment. Even Princess M would be better because she'll provide more damage overall. It might be wise to level him out and get those hearts on him for when he gets his EE. He might become really great then.

Pretty much all of the legendaries have stats high enough that they are worth using no matter your team color.  Taking Lucid or not depends on what you want to focus on.

soccerspirits,3dbqpd,Hyaz,3,Wed Jul 15 01:13:04 2015 UTC,"First and foremost thanks for taking the time to do this. The concept and execution are nice and I hope to see it improve. That being said I'll just dump a list of small QoL things if you care about them.  Consider a different color background. White isn't bad but without any borders or anything to lessen the intensity of the plain white.  For the text that denotes a characters type (Leader, Attacker) consider a different font, size and a color that matches their type in game, (Blue for Defender, Green for Assist, Red for Leader, etc)  You've done a good job having different sort features for all the units however within their own attribute there is no organization. I personally think it would be appropriate to have the units sorted by their team affiliation and then sub divided by their unit. For example if I just looked at Light units it would list the Heaven's Gate units first then Yggdrassil Guardians units. Units in the same sub-team would be listed side by side, so the first sub team Gate would have Latios, Mikael, Celus, Raguel then Fizz and Mireille.  Add Spirit Stone slot details for each unit. Add Spirit Stone list and tab with primary stat values at each rank and stone level."

You also can't go from the regular card to it's EE without backing and selecting it.  Also, the stats don't seem to be accurate. For some reason my Ravian (with same superb level and extra points) is reading off as a point or two off on the total, and somehow has almost 1000 more reflex than she should. o.o  Other than that, it looks great. You did an excellent job. One suggestion I want to add for sorting is skill type, like [Pass] [Long Pass] ect."
soccerspirits,3dbqpd,Archfiendrai,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:27:15 2015 UTC,"The website looks gorgeous but I'm curious how you got the stats. I'm comparing my +120 MSPU Hiro and Kei to the database and the numbers are really off, even when taking into account spirit stones and managers.   database lists +120 MSPU kei as pwr 223, tech 327, vit 316, speed 235. Kei according to the database would have over 2K reflexes.  My kei has pwr 193, tech 297, vit 286, speed 205, and that's after subtracting manager bonuses. I've seen my Kei get to about 1.3K reflex with chains and Mikael toteming in game.   Hiro's reflexes are listed as 2125 O_O. Everybody's reflexes seem to be over 1K once you L60 and add a few superbs...."
soccerspirits,3dbqpd,Murol,2,Wed Jul 15 01:35:45 2015 UTC,This is because the reflex formula in the site doesn't take into account the player's level. It is the same error for hp. What the site shows is your reflex if reflex didn't get reduced with level (it assumes everyone is level 1).

My best draw was Btort. I was still new and didn't really think i had a place for her since my GK was Lucian and i was doing OK. About a day later she was my CM, then she got her EE and Lucian is now smoking crack waiting for his EE.

Even though I recently got Jin, I still consider Beatrice my favourite (and best) draw. That's because I got her during the time when she was the absolute number one striker in the game. Plus I was using a 3* striker before her since I had nothing better at my desposal, therefore you can imagine how happy I was to get her.

But what made me really amazed was that I had taken the time to evolve her (which, with a B rank team, was damn hard), and then only a few days later she got an EE. Not to mention I also had Iggy at the time and so I was like ""The two 5-stars on my team both getting EEs? Awesome!"" But yeah, she may have been benched, but I'll remember to page her when I build a mono-WW team. For the time she served she was amazing.  My best draw? Most likely Hildegard. I mean, I had Maggie on my mid for the longest time, and then Jean for a stint, but getting Hildegard was perfect. And yet I didn't even think that much about getting her.  My best scout though...boy have I scouted many. Gerold, Beatrice, Kei, Malcolm...but I think I'll say Kei since I never had a proper goalie until I got him.

But the character I have the most sentimentality for is Lilith. Within my first 2000 crystals she was somehow full-superbed from draw dupes (Mono draw tabs FTW) - for about 50 ranks she was my penetrating goddess.

Before that I was convinced I was never going to draw a legend because rng and then here he comes. Needless to say once all my hype was over I realised he was getting benched. Still, free legend is free legend."
soccerspirits,3ddt8g,djamj,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:58:04 2015 UTC,My first 5* was Kei and I did not think much of him untill I saw his BA EE and was like dang this guy is cool.  My best would be William since I really needed a stricker at the start of season 2 when we got legends but other then that would be Kiki and she has really grown on me
soccerspirits,3ddt8g,LiHood,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:14:51 2015 UTC,"1st was Dale. And since RNG decided I should go dark with all the dark units, Dale was my ace for a long time.    Best was definitely Baltheon. Though I didn't know his true worth then. He has been in my team ever since.    The best experience however was getting Beatrice. She was the best striker back then. With her, I have Veronica - Baltheon - Beatrice frontline. I was thinking, yup, my frontline is complete now. lol."

Then Lucian was released, i spent mad gold trying to find Lucian after he's scoutable to no avail.  Then Lia appeared, screamed, scouted her, screamed some more.  and the rest is history.  Best draw was definitely the consecutive legends (knee slid when that happened) or my Hyunmu since i got her from a random free premium draw (the 2 days one free draw thing)  Best scout was Lia definitely, close second was the day where i got 3 Littres."

Was reading some info on her, where she is considered top tier if you actually had the stuff you needed to make her top tier.   Decided screw it and just go with her, always liked how she looks, was still OHKO most lowbie stuff so I didn't mind.  Then I got to 30.  Lo and behold, Baltheon with his over 900!!!... passes, with a Scouted Veronica and Blade's receive pass passive she is still OHKOing a lot of stuff.  Can't wait to max Baltheon just to see how high that dribble can go when combined with other stuff.  BUT... I have to mention someone who changed my gameplay experience completely since I got her from when I was really low ranked, and she isn't even a 5 *.  It's freaking Eden.  I decided to superb her since she only needed 3 star litres, I ST her once and she is currently and easily one of my top units.  That speed bonus is SO GUD."

The very first 5* was Skorn, iirc, followed soon by anael and mikael, with blue dragon on the side. I was using reveto as healer and was lucky enough to scout kei as my very first scout. Before i knew it i was almost there for a full light team which was actually not bad, at least for the first levels. However RNG giveth, RNG taketh: my first decent 5* striker was beatrice at lvl 60-ish.    My best 5* experience is Mikael: he's a damn beast both in mid or back. He can penetrate easily almost everyone in a 1v1, doing crazy dmg and taking almost none, not to mention the fact that he'll bring the ball to the attack with enough spirit to use both the assist and the striker active."

soccerspirits,3dct2f,Anal_Llama,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:45:28 2015 UTC,"Rasiel's EE has the potential to make utility frontlines amazing. Less speed, less reflexes to the opponent on top of the 20% boost to attack, HP and pass effect to the line that she brings to the table? Even if the former is for two minutes, that can be plenty of time to get another shot off and make it hurt.   Also, is it me or will Ravian be even stronger with her partnering up with Rasiel and Jeunese? I'm honestly expecting Ravian to rise in use for this by a lot.  Edit: This may go without saying, but I am sure that the times were meant to be from 10pm to 12am.

soccerspirits,3dct2f,ChloeCelestia,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:22:22 2015 UTC,I wouldn't waste my time with a Rasiel front. Alkyde will always be better for Ravian.  Alkyde has higher natural reflex (much higher because Assist = Technique = Reflex). She has an unconditional reflex debuff and can active pass to Ravian before the totem or Alkyde loses the ball.   Rasiel's best position will always be a CM totem but there are much better units elsewhere. Qiyou has an EE and she's mainly used in mono-WW so I don't expect Rasiel anywhere besides mono-Lightball.

soccerspirits,3dd66r,Zaylo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:37:10 2015 UTC,I dont think MW is concerned with her enemy's action speed. And its a nice passive sure; but you have to look at the oppertunity cost of running her. Is she going ot be good enough to warrant a spot in an already cramped light/x team?
soccerspirits,3dd66r,garguybbj,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:40:31 2015 UTC,"Well, for a non-late game player, she may be useful because she is a freenium player. As a boss, it will be easier for most people to FSPU her, and thereby making her cost-efficient as opposed to some non-SPU units. Also, her first passive is a nice totem for the position. Maybe I missed something, but her EE cost hasn't been released yet. She may be like Ravian and have only a small increase in cost; 28 cost is ridiculous for evo >.<"

Beforehand we just accepted that Qiyou had an EE because she had one/got one before she was even released as a ""Boss"" unit (in the Korean server which was before Global was opened at all).  Now we know that BBall is willing to hand Bosses EEs. Which gives me hope for Alkyde/Jury/Daisy/Elise who are all considered great units."

soccerspirits,3db2j8,TheJediJew,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:46:32 2015 UTC,I used to but it's sooo unstable. It drops connection more often than the game does and it resets the channel when it does.  If there was a way to set a default channel then it could work but right now it's more effort than its worth.
soccerspirits,3db2j8,deamonkiller,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:37:12 2015 UTC,I hope they fix it soon. :/ Participating in game-related discussions and chats ingame while playing really improves enjoyment imo (and also helps a lot to pass the grinding time).

I have been getting handled lately in PvP. Been moving up steadily and have been going back and forth from silver to gold and back again.  Before getting into the player list, is there a reason why Bea would NOT active shoot after receiving an active pass from Nari? Have enough spirit but sometimes (it cost me a win today) she just doesnt pull the trigger.  ok so here are my worth while 5* players, please help me in PvP;  WW - Bea (ST/EE), Btort (EE), Kiki (E), Magnus (E), Silk, Linmay (E), Rudiel, Vbird,   Ardor - Shu (E), Nari (E), Lucian (E), Yuri (E), Sage, Jean  Thunder - Nerua (E), Veronica (E), Jury (E), Griffith  Light - Mikael (EE), Milky (E) (held off on using her lately in anticipation of nerf), Anael (E), Latios  Dark - Ravian (E), Zibroi, Lillith (E), Lynbell"
soccerspirits,3db2j8,vrainsworth,2,Wed Jul 15 17:34:27 2015 UTC,"Before getting into the player list, is there a reason why Bea would NOT active shoot after receiving an active pass from Nari? .   cause AI is like that, they don't use active 100%  But otherwise, it would be helpful to say which part of your team feels like its underperforming  at a glance I would use this team  Nari - Yuri - Beatrice (ace)  Linmay - Jury - Bird  Kiki - Magnus - Nerua - Mikael  Turtle  This makes full use of Turtle's annoying self-buff. Linmay and Jury are decent reflex walls, with Jury being a good ballholder, while Birdie does his attacking thing (also has chain with Turtle so that's good). The weakpoint is that the midline is slow, and Jury's HP% penalty on hit is more of a minor annoyance than something actually dangerous. If you want a fast(er) midline you can move either Kiki or Magnus up mid. Having Neraizel instead of Nari as passer will also greatly boost the team's speed, especially that fast backline."
soccerspirits,3db2j8,pkruger82,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:08:58 2015 UTC,"cause AI is like that, they don't use active 100%   Can't stand that. Especially with full spirit and your back to the wall yet they won't use Long/FWD pass......the anger  OK so i see a lot of mention of using Bird opposed to Shu. I have not evo'd Bird yet at all. Does his EE + turtle chain, make him that much of a better fit than Shu?  Also i felt like Linmay never performed well...at least for me.   I am going to give this setup a try after i at least evo1 Bird. It is WW day so it shouldn't take long. I will get back to you on how this pans out."
soccerspirits,3db2j8,vrainsworth,2,Wed Jul 15 18:37:38 2015 UTC,"Bird actually hits harder than Shu both with and without the ball, even when you don't count chain bonus; Shu is for action bar utility which works well with specific cards and stones, but I don't think your WW-heavy team needs it.  I don't like Linmay either though there aren't too many choices. Anael from the other suggestion is ok, but without superbs (I assume she doesn't, since you're at silver-gold) she will really underperform. Silk is also an ok choice if you don't want Linmay."

soccerspirits,3db2j8,Shahadah,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:38:15 2015 UTC,Let me give a suggestion as well.  Front: Nari - Silla(ACE) - Blade  Mid: Veronica - Sammy - Beth  Back: Kiki - Nerua - Mikael  Kei GK. Support slot can vary. You can put another totem for Kei at the back or Victoria mid for the sweet reflex buff. It varies a bit from the other guy's formation but generally it should operate similar. I moved Veronica mid because I imagine you need the crit buff and also reflexes. She also buffs Blade without being in the same line.
soccerspirits,3db2j8,Wahuh,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:25:07 2015 UTC,"With the units you have I would suggest this:          Nari Veronica Blade   Beth Sammy Hildegard   Kiki Nerua Mikael    Kei     Support: Silla (ACE)  Some fairly drastic changes to give your Kei more HP at the back. Swapping to Silla ace reduces the chances of Kei getting 1 shot. Lia would be pretty strong in that backline if you need more speed. Swapped Yuri for Veronica because Blade needs as much crit as she can get. Also the reflex boost will help out Nari. Replaced Mikael with Hildegard, attacker for attacker.   Put Sammy CM as she's better at ball holding than Beth. You want Beth at the side so she can penetrate and give you those delicious buffs. You have alot of good units so you can be fairly versatile with your team."

soccerspirits,3db2j8,lastra1,2,Wed Jul 15 12:25:29 2015 UTC,"If there's no reason you wouldn't want to touch Zib in favour of Kei, use the self-healing one. It's easier to tank with him. Then you can go two patters, penetrate or long/forward pass. Let's pick a healer and HP totem to boost healing, you may switch between Nerua and Magnus depending on opponent. Let's go the first path for now. You TOP contender for penetrating is Malcolm, but you may also want to use utility Shoes, Anael would be fine, but she lacks some power. Let's add shoe supporters. Let's Malcolm in the back and make other shoe in mid position. Let's choose right side by random. Let's make Lucid right too, it's crucial for you strategy that Lucid moves first and transfroms into Eclipse form. It does matter right after you use Avn heals. So now we choose two to accompany Lucid. First in without doubt Nari, because she steals and passes. Second... Silla, because... she steals and passes. With opponents of 800-1100 reflex and no counter resist, front counter is really effective in PvE. You can use Yuri for one-shot performance, but she can't steal, and since it will become harder to one-shot opponents the higher you go, the more important it is to steal.  So it goes like this: (Zombroi tanks) -> Avn heal -> (Zombroi tanks) -> Malcolm penetrates -> Shoe penetrates -> Lucid Eclipse -> (insert Elizabeth here) -> Nari/Silla active pass -> Lucid active shoots -> Silla/Nari counter -> Silla/Nari active pass -> Lucid shoot -> (steal/shoot some more if needed) -> Goaaal.  If you lose the ball in mid or front, you can skip few steps and go straing Malcolm penetrates -> Lucid Eclipse.  Natural candidates for uniques are Shoe and Lucid. Silla/Malcolm ace.  For better view.          Nari Silla Lucid   Lilith/Anael/Guin Alkyde/Luka Shoe   Nerua/Magnus Avn Malcolm    Z     Now let's consider Mariel the evil passer and lineskippers. You just pass in def and attack/tank the ball with Zombroi. When opponent gets tired of Mariel, you can forward pass with Linmay/Rasiel with Eden in line as speed buffer. Front counter is even more important, because you have limited number of times you can use long pass, so use Mariel ace and sometimes Lucid to steal. Repeat the previous pattern from Lucid Eclipse part.          Nari Silla Lucid   Rasiel Alkyde/Linmay Eden/spirit gen   Nerua/Magnus Avn Mariel    Z     If you wanted to use Kei, you would need Linmay and light crit stone or two to support him.  EDit.

Bea EE/ST Kiki E Nari E   Mikael EE Jury E Yuri E   Shu E Magnus E Nerua E    Btort EE     That is my basic lineup i have some tweaks for PvP/Cod. example is in CoD i put in Lucian E and Jury E on Backline with Magnus and Nerua. Also i switch in long pass/forward pass bassed on what floor.  Mikael is starting to feel out of place. Especially if i EE yuri next. I am hoping to find a Lia in scout for the dual WW/Ardor Ace. instead of forcing to use lucian. And don't tell me i need Nera.....i know...and its been 2 months...i have not seen her one time...RNG hates me (clearly seen by my Shu) lol
soccerspirits,3db2j8,thedup,2,Wed Jul 15 12:06:00 2015 UTC,"well you're already locked in ww/ardor, so don't be sad about the shu, just stick with nari, I like her more for beatrice anyway although some disagree. I would personally ee nari since she gets more pass effect, or kiki because she adds pass effect to line, both will increase your damage by quite a bit. and i'm super jealous of your btort, at least you can scout lia lol"
soccerspirits,3db2j8,pkruger82,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:39:23 2015 UTC,"You know originally when Nari had popped in my scout people said to just pass and wait for Nera. I still want Nera but Nari has been a huge help to my frontline and DMG output.   I am still playing around but one thing i have been trying to focus on currently is getting a stupid high Crit Rate. With so many goalies going for Crit Resist, why not just go even high Crit Rate?  EDIT Yes Btort Rocks! The 2 things that give me trouble with her so far are Thunder Strikers (i run Magnus and Nerua for that sweet debuff against everything but Thunder) and Ravian. Her % is killer since your always focused on staying over 50% with Btort.  Actually if anyone could help me clear up how Crit Resist v Crit Rate works exactly that would be awesome."

soccerspirits,3db2j8,lastra1,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:12:09 2015 UTC,"Got this evil idea of Nerua as the makeshift anti-crit GK, because she has one of the best stone slots.  Let's make some math.  Anti cirt: Knight's Pride II = 30%, Ermalation = 25%, Green speed stone = 22%, Blue defense stone = 22%, Prism  Blue defense stone = 22%, total 121%  HP: raw HP second only to King Jin, Ermaltion = 25%, Oath / Knight's Oath 20%, Ace 35%.  No damage reduction, Oath's 20% defense bonus + 2 defense stones, no tanky block, no positional buff. Not ideal, but probably enough to be called makeshift GK xD  Also comparing to Raklet, 724 vs. 589 base HP at full upgrades, Raklet has 30% HP self buff and another 3x30% for 10min on attack, power-up type active and only blue slots (44% crit res). Positional buff.  Does anyone else think that Nerua may be better GK than Raklet?"

soccerspirits,3db2j8,Teddybearriot,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:07:10 2015 UTC,I'm here for advice on how best to improve my team:          Latios Kevin Luka   Gerrold Nari Lucius   Saramir Trones Erica    Jin     I also have Jean and Rudiel as unused 5* players.  I'm looking for any recommendations on how I might develop my team from here as I could use some guidance.  Should I switch around my lineup at all?  Do you see any big holes where my team is currently lacking?  Which color combination would be natural to go into an endgame using some of the players I have?  Any good scout targets to look out for?
soccerspirits,3db2j8,TheJediJew,3,Wed Jul 15 08:55:23 2015 UTC,"Kevin isn't useful at the front unless you're stacking action bar. He's fantastic with Lucid, Milky Way or a Metatron will user, but otherwise you'd be better off with a damage totem. Valkia is a good 4 star option.  Sarami's overwhelming won't stack with Jin's at the back too unless you leave one of them unevloved. If you have evolved Saramir, then put her in midfield rather. Overwhelming is very useful there.  Ultimately it's still too early to be worrying too much about your team setup. You're still a good few 5 stars short of a solid team. You could use a better penetrator (I don't know Lucius very well so maybe he's the man). If you spot Malcolm or Mikael in scout then grab them for sure.  Don't stress about attributes yet. RNGesus will have his way."
soccerspirits,3db2j8,Poringun,3,Wed Jul 15 09:04:26 2015 UTC,"Lucius i found is VERY solid, a more reliable super play with Crumble!  (60% crit rate and Penetration, basically max level fatal blow with level 4 Song of Knife in a single skill)   Lucius is practically a mini Khirel :D."

soccerspirits,3db2j8,Poringun,2,Wed Jul 15 09:41:53 2015 UTC,"Jedi gave a really good advice :D, however, i'd suggest not getting Mikael or Malcolm as soon as you could since they are not your number one priority  A different striker is more important IMO since Latios hits light (pun unintended)   Malcolm specifically is much LESS important since you already have Lucius who is basically a mini legend (Khirel)/Malcolm with more damage but less utility."
soccerspirits,3db2j8,Teddybearriot,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:50:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the additional clarification!  I have noticed Latios struggling lately, often needing 4x shots to finish off a GK, so my experience tends to agree with you on that point.  Although as Jedi pointed out, Kevin probably wasn't helping on that front.  Do you think there is a use for Kevin on my current team?  Also, are there any strikers I should be particularly on the lookout for when scouting?"
soccerspirits,3db2j8,Poringun,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:23:21 2015 UTC,"Since your team is shaping up really nicely towards a WW/Ardor team, i'd suggest Beatrice for raw damage, or Kirin :D  Oh and rather than Erica, Rudiel should be able to steal the ball easier."

My other units are: Metatron, Vitos, Uriel, Ustiel, Cynthia, Luka, Reklet, Mariel, Lilith. Please dont kill me for not using Metatron ;~; Is there a way I can make a better team with these units?

soccerspirits,3db2j8,TheJediJew,2,Wed Jul 15 08:51:39 2015 UTC,"Rule number 1 - Focus on one striker.  Kirin is the best you have so go with him.  Rule 2 - no penetrators on the front line.  You want an assistor and totem for 99% of team builds. Use Luka and Metatron.  Rule 3 - USE METATRON  Consider yourself killed :P  With that done lets talk about the rest of your team.  In midfield I'd pick Cynthia, Lilith and Jacob. This is probably the weakest part of your team. Jacob should be replaced with a tank or a reflex/damage totem.  At the back: Enthia, Lia, and Kiki with Leonard in goal.  You can still go with the Ardor/WW ace too."
soccerspirits,3db2j8,Tomion,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:12:09 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure I put Lia as Ace, not sure, someone with the Ardor/WW ace.  Thing is I dont really know any character's role.  you're saying my team should look something like this:          Kirin Luka Metatron   Cynthia Lilith Jacob   Enthia Lia Kiki    Leonard     Also can you explain to me what Jacob does? I have 0 idea as for his role. and just a question - why Leonard and not Reklet? (in your opinion of course) edit: and what characters would you say best to repalce jacob with? just so I know who to watch for when I scout."
soccerspirits,3db2j8,TheJediJew,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:19:02 2015 UTC,"Pretty much, yeah.  Jacob works as a totem. His job is to make the rest of the players in the line better. There's no point having two attackers since they'll be attacking different targets. Rather buff one and give him/her the best chance possible to crack through in one.  The same logic especially applies up front. You want one striker doing maximum damage because you lose the ball after the shot. At least in midfield you get a second chance provided you survive.   Anyway let's get back to Jacob. His active is great for buffing damage and he generates spirit really easily. He also buffs Cynthia's attack by a monster 35%. She's your primary penetrator so that combo will do big damage.  Lilith is there as a totem and counter-attacker. She buffs the line with healing and can steal the ball back easily with Entice. unfortunately her active and Dazzlement are both crap so I'd want to swap her out with a better totem or tank when you get one.  An upgrade on Jacob's specific role would be Princess Meiran, but there are a number of other options you could go for.   The key thing to remember is I've built a team using the players you have. Once you get new players the entire team strategy could change so it's difficult to recommend replacements."
soccerspirits,3db2j8,Poringun,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:41:29 2015 UTC,"Jacob is there for the active and either Pincer attack, or fiery charisma  for that tiny bit extra crit rate.  Personal suggestion to replace Jacob, Victoria, THE best reflex totem in game.   I'd also suggest replacing Lilith with an actual ball holder since Lilith just melts if she gets attacked. Meiran is a good ball holder for midfield (skilling up fantastic operation) while also giving the line a 30/30 % reflex/crit rate buff."

soccerspirits,3db2j8,TheJediJew,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:59:57 2015 UTC,Leonard is a damn good keeper. By far the best 4 star option and easily the best rival in the game.   Unless you find one of the big two (Kei and Jin) you're set with him.

After losing 12  PvP matches in a row in my quest to diamond I have decided to stop for the time being and find myself questioning whether my PvP team is set-up optimally. So I ask my fellow redditors to help build me a PvP team and also a Colosseum team/ Story team (if possible as well) using my existing units of course.  So here is my list of units  I feel like Veronica is too fragile at the front lines.  But my biggest problem is that my Kei gets one-shotted alot.
soccerspirits,3db2j8,TheJediJew,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:49:52 2015 UTC,"Going for Diamond your available Uniques stones will matter. Can you list them if any?  But from what I see here:     Hiro     Luka     Guin Eden   Sammy   Vernoica     Khirel         Nerua    Kei   Mikael              Jin   Use Mikael as your Ace. If you have a Light/WW ace it would be perfect. Ideally I would swap Beatrice in for Hiro but I see that your Hiro is fully upgraded and Beatrice may not be.   khirel is going to need counterattack resistance too. If it's really bad then you could swap him with Mikael.   I'd want to swap Guin out for Kiki if you get her, but I'm afraid /u/Marisachu might hear me."
soccerspirits,3db2j8,ragemader,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:26:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks for replying and about my unique stones I have:  An Essence of greed, Endless burning mass and Paradise of light.  I might stick to using my Kei over Jin since Kei is superb 3 compared to Jin who has none.  I also forgot to list the superbs that each unit has, so...  1 superb: Beatrice, Khirel, Mikael  3 superb: Hildegard  4 superb: Luka  Max superb: Jury, Hiro, Qiyou, Eden  Everyone else either has 1 superb or none at all. I might not be strong enough to reach diamond in my current state actually.."
soccerspirits,3db2j8,TheJediJew,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:53:10 2015 UTC,"Whoa, it took way too long for me to get back to you.  Ok so: EBM should go on Sammy, Paradice should go on Mikael ideally but Hiro can work if you don't have better 6 star stones, and EoG should go on Beatrice if you can get her up to Hiro level in the long run. It doesn't have a natural home right now.  The other option I guess is to use Guin as your Striker (again in the long run) with EoG. Pair her with Kevin and Luka and you can get a crazy fast front line ohko striker.  But none of that will help you get to diamond this season, so stick with Hiro and put EoG on whoever can use it."

soccerspirits,3db2j8,blackjacksme,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:03:00 2015 UTC,"its a simple equation, for example your striker has 60% crit rate, and enemy gk has 50% crit resist, now your striker has only 10% chance on getting a critical when he/she shots"
soccerspirits,3db2j8,Soziele,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:26:39 2015 UTC,"Lowers crit rate.  For stones it depends on the striker you are up against.  Crit resist is better against Hiro, Blade, Beatrice, William, and OHKO Ravian.  Decrease damage is better against strikers that do weaker damage per shot or don't need criticals, like Sharr, Bora, Kirin, Utility Ravian, Lucid, Vitos, and Leventor."

soccerspirits,3db2j8,lastra1,2,Wed Jul 15 05:02:37 2015 UTC,"PoME = 25%, red reflex stone = 22%, prism slot stone = 22%, Nerua = 30%, skill = 20%, that's 119%, add some lucky suboptions from stones, you can reach 125%-130%. With Magnus Ace it can reach 150%."
soccerspirits,3db2j8,Morpal_Cxir,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:20:52 2015 UTC,I see. I've been using the Decrease Inflicted Damage Defense Stones for my Jin's red and prism slots. I'm assuming it's a good idea to switch those out for the Reflex and Crit Resist Stones? I happen to have 2 on hand.
soccerspirits,3db2j8,lastra1,2,Wed Jul 15 06:25:50 2015 UTC,"That's what most top rankers run, with red reduction stone out of picture you can use dark reduction instead (some cases use dark HP with good subs), so you won't lose much.  For prism slot, you can choose between red reflex, green speed or blue defense stone with the last being most popular."
soccerspirits,3db2j8,Morpal_Cxir,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:29:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info! As an aside, what do you think of this backline with Jin?  Kiki, Yuri, Mikael, and Nerua. Their health buffs combined give my Jin just slightly above 4k HP. I'm tinkering with the idea of replacing Yuri with Magnus. Half because Sharr and William are the only strikers besides Ravian/Jeneuse combo that can reliably kill Jin. The other half of the reason is that Yuri AI is stupid as Hell. I've watched her penetrate all the way to the top and then kick the ball for like 100 damage. =/  I'm also tinkering with the idea of using a fully superb'd Jury for my CM. I know she's not optimal, but auto AI is baaaaad and I've seen countless times where my midline kill themselves with the -15% debuff. Right now, I'm going with Duke, Metatron, and Beth. Jury would probably replace Beth. What do you think?"
soccerspirits,3db2j8,lastra1,2,Wed Jul 15 06:46:45 2015 UTC,"I think your Jin would just be a lump of meat screaming ""hey, hit me more"". You don't have a good, reliable penetrator. i'll just copy further part:   No, not Mikael or Yuri that are totems doubling for penetrators, a real one. Even Anael is better, she may not have HP buff, but double attack and great reflex work well for her and with full superbs, she can one-shot too. Other choices are Malcolm or Lucius who also have double attacks, but are not L/T. Bell and Khirell are legends. Utility Hilde could be good too, but you will probably need her in mid. Comparing to them, Mikael has no helpful skills except for minor damage boos, but end-game PvP, when most players have high superbs, damage is around the last thing you need for a penetrator, because most of them can one-shot without much trying. What Mikael lacks is reflex. While you can think he has some because of his buff, it will be nothing comparing to end-game stealers with 1.8k+ reflex. With Yuri and Nerua buff he may be usable, but not most reliable out there and existence of reliable back penetrator is what saves you from consecutive shots and allows you to start your own offensive. For further analysis and proof of above, watch some of the high-end vids.   Also Beth apart from having strong stats, her active is just OP, especially in combination with Metatron. She's also a chain for Duke. Metatron is best CM, her bar regeneration affects matches more than Jury's hp reduction in addition to Metatron's top class stats. Duke - Meta - Beth is one of the best options around, I don't see why you would want to change that.  I'll also add that I've been wandering at about 2000-2200 league rank lately and only found my player breaking because of Jury only once. Most of the time, reflex is saving in direct confrontation while matches are too fast for Jury to deal serious damage."

Obv better options for CM/CL etc. exist like Sammy who can heal on passes or Lia in the back line, but you get the idea.  How do you think this will work out?

Usually this required Kevin + a unique but Milky could do this with just her own passives, Kevin, and a two blue pen stones. There was a good few weeks where Kevin + Milky dominated in PVP. Hence why she got nerfed, and there's an upcoming patch to cap starting action bar.   It's suspected the recall is for ppl who specifically brought her with the $100 anniversary pack. Some of the confusion might just be translation issues. The two posts I linked to above have translations of the same post, but one mentions a general removal while the other only mentions a recall.

My question is this : What's the best skill build for her ? no SPUs. Also, is Elizabeth's position Forward Mid optimal ? I tried using Silla there, but she's still too squishy.  And who should I be looking for next ? totems or backliners ? I was thinking of saving for Nerua/Anael.  My other options are Valkia, Gerrard, Mira, Mimi, Juno."
soccerspirits,3d6fs9,lastra1,0,Tue Jul 14 16:55:45 2015 UTC,"Silla when she's only passer, you can only use Formation of Light and Active, spend rest on spirit gen for Sharr. Her position should be on either side, since she gains nice speed boost.  Elizabeth's position should be on bench or in mid, she's a poor totem, but she can steal. I think Valkia's evil pass can be more helpful.  You scout list should be filled with back totems (NeruaGod, Yuri, Kiki), potent LM player like Anael and probably a better front passer to use Silla as totem/secondary passer, Nera/Nari/Baltheon can pass for around twice as much as Silla and for power shooter like Sharr, that difference may be crucial. Why not go Light/Dark striker as well? And a Dark Lucius a.k.a. Malcolm."

soccerspirits,3d6fs9,lastra1,0,Tue Jul 14 18:45:53 2015 UTC,"There is no problem in you having two strikers later in game. While she may not be best match for Light/Dark composition, you could say that there is no better end-game striker that Sharr, that's because there is no better end-game GK than Jin, and Sharrs eat Jins. But for other purposes, you may find having Light/Dark one more beneficial."
soccerspirits,3d6fs9,garguybbj,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:53:26 2015 UTC,"Since you use Silla as your main passer, I would go 5-1-5-0 for her. This helps maximize her pass effect as well as giving Sharr attack and penetration bonuses. Elizabeth really works better on one of the sides in the front, but I'm not too clear on that since I use her in RM.  You really don't need totems for now, since both Silla and Elizabeth can work as totems for your front, and in mid you have Meta. Your next move would probably be to replace one of your long passers in the back. Replace Morgana if you want your Kei to have more HP, or remove Clarisa if you want anti-crit. It's really up to you since you have a rainbow team. Cynthia looks kind of out of place as well, though that can be taken care of later. Go ahead and scout Neura if you can, she's one of the best defenders in the game, and can replace someone in your defense. Don't Extreme Evolve her yet though, because one of her best passives which increases HP and Defense (for Kei) will change to only Thunder players. Only EE her if you want to go Thunder, or if you would rather get her other two passives for crit resist and decrease damage.  SPU your Sharr, then your Kei, and afterwards maybe Silla, Metatron, Lucius. You have a nice rainbow team going. Good luck!"

soccerspirits,3d6fs9,lastra1,0,Tue Jul 14 14:01:35 2015 UTC,"Put it on your Mikael when you find one. Dale will be more useful that Jury since you need at least one line breaker.  You made a good choice on Kiki and Victoria, but Alkyde would probably have been better in front. Then again, it may be even better with Alkyde instead of Silla to use Ravian counter to the max over Silla."
soccerspirits,3d6fs9,Junimond,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:49:45 2015 UTC,I used Dale all time until now but in the matches he seemed so useless to me because I never used him to break the line cause Metatron was way more effective for that somehow mhhh  And yes i guess youre right about Alkyde as replacement for Silla :)  Thanks :)
soccerspirits,3d6fs9,lastra1,0,Tue Jul 14 15:25:01 2015 UTC,"Few reasons to use Dale. First of all, Dale has TOP10 highest raw dribble stat. Secondly, he needs additional crit rate, because one of his skills boost crit damage. Thirdly, you use Ravian and gives points for Dale, because Dale is reflex killer that triggers with penetration, the means not onlt it's a bit more difficult to counter him when he attacks, but also he can deal damage to reflex of the opposing defense line making it easier for Ravian to counter. Last, but not least, when you reach end-game, most attackers can easily one-shot non-tankers, that applies to Dale too."
soccerspirits,3d6fs9,Junimond,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:06:38 2015 UTC,Thanks Lastra :) Nice post. I´ll consider using Dale then. At least until I can get Mikael. I guess he would be the best (non legend) choice for my team comp. Would you agree?
soccerspirits,3d6fs9,lastra1,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:35:58 2015 UTC,"Ah... that... Mikael is not a bad player, he is a good totem, but don't like him too much. His reflex is trash and he's the only one to get countered regularly. Like I said earlier, in end-game, it's fairly easy to one shot when your units have decent superbs, it applies to this guy too, he can deal damage, but he can just as easily get countered. I guess he's a very good totem, but I wouldn't want him penetrate without Anael/Yuri/Nerua buffs. He's light and there is a couter cap at 60%, so he's fairly viable, but as a Ravian user you should know it well, every single counter can cost you a lot. And well, he can wear Glab.  I strongly believe that better addition would be Malcolm. While he shares Mikael's weakness of low reflex and has no line buffs, he can wield up to 3 counter resist stones and even if he gets countered, he is almost sure to get the ball back with Super Play, also he breaks opponent spirits and his cruelty can push his dribble very high. I'd call him most reliable penetrator. Ever.  Another great addition would be Nerua. Sheer awesomeness of her buffs make her godly totem in any deck. She's not a really good stealer like Anael though, but she a tanky unit with good spirit slots for a defender. Considering Hiros and Beatrices as one of most popular ace/strikers, Nerua is really helpful there."
soccerspirits,3d6fs9,Junimond,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:54:00 2015 UTC,"Nice, thank you for that post, it helps a lot :) So i guess ill just try to get Malcolm from scout.

Right now Iam playing with Victora|Alkyde|Ravian."
soccerspirits,3d6fs9,lastra1,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:37:29 2015 UTC,"Alkyde - reflex totem - Ravian is pretty classic line, it also means it's that much effective, however you will be feeling limit of it sooner or later. Apart from 60% counter cap, opponent reflex destroyers and counter resistors may become pain in PvP. Some people cope with it by concentrating on stealing in mid, some bring additional stealer in front, others just push their reflex modifiers to the limit to use Ravian's instant counter better. Can't say that one way is better than another, but for that level of fine-tweaking, you should ask someone who's more experienced with using Ravian than myself. I'll also add that Ravian's reflex isn't exactly high-tier, so breaking opposing reflex seem more efficient than boosting your own."

As such, PoL can be almost twice as good in providing HP as those, so for better effect, equip it on your tanks (incl. GK).

soccerspirits,3d6fs9,frozensinx,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:17:48 2015 UTC,"No not really they usually drop more 4* than this time, it is speculated that the reason for this is because of the Alkyde boss/rival matches are somewhat outdated since they were the one of the first to be released and BB just didn't update them that's why the 3* also can't be sold for 1 gp like the other rival matches"
soccerspirits,3d6fs9,Meekasa,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:56:20 2015 UTC,"Hi guys, very new to the game, I'd like some help with my team. Currently it looks like this: http://imgur.com/6h45lyI Characters not shown: Meg, Sam (EE), Neraizel, Min, Elliot.  I'm mostly interested in light/ww players but since I got so many dark I decided to just roll with it. If you could give any tips on formation, or just tips in general I'd be very thankful!"
soccerspirits,3d6fs9,lastra1,0,Tue Jul 14 11:47:37 2015 UTC,"As of now, I can guarantee you that being interested in light/ww players isn't wise because they lack a good ace. Also because you will end practically rainbow (multicolored) which often loses in power to more specialized decks. While it may be good for beginners, it's hard to recommend as long-term goal.  Soem general advice would include moving your Striker to either side to avoing her shooting against 3 people effectively lowering damage to goalkeeper. Switch Orses and Veronica and use Baltheon Ace. Other than that... get more cards."

You want to max superb your Hiro first and then Jin.   NB. You need 5x 3* litres to evolve into a 5* litre. 3* litres don't work on 5* players.

soccerspirits,3d6fs9,frozensinx,2,Tue Jul 14 11:54:50 2015 UTC,For littres you also max superb your striker first and since your striker is Hiro a very powerful end game striker you should definitely superb him first. In terms of power-ups it usually goes Striker-Goalie-Assist-Attacker so after fully superbing your Hiro you should focus on your Jin
soccerspirits,3d6fs9,Jahfan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:40:46 2015 UTC,"I've come to a dilemma with my team's backline so, I thought posting here and getting some feedback would help.  Here is my team.  Currently Rank 82.  Superbs, Dale (2 from Dupes), Ravian (MSPU), Alkyde (MSPU), Linmay (1 from Dupe), Jin (2)  And these are the benched 5 stars in my possession   Ardor  Victoria (E), Elanie, Jacob x2 (ST Fodder)  WW  Saramir, Elizabeth (MSPU), Hyunmu (Have Jin), Princess M., VBird  Thunder  Nerua, Guin, Luka, Hildegard, Vann Savior of Thunder, Jury (MSPU), Shitty Hildegard (Beta), Butcher, Eden (Special Mention)  Light   Kei (Have Jin), Virgin, White Guardenia, Cassiel, Ustiel (Queen ST Fodder)   <--- This is why I don't run Meta Ace  Dark  Lilith (EE, 2SPU from Dupes), Valkia (ST'd), Avnore, Jeunese, Orses, Lucifer, Niarose, ST Fodder Ravian, Lynbell  My problem is I have too many contenders for my backline and not enough spots to field them all. The cards I have under consideration are; Avnore, Kiki, Magnus, Malcolm, Nerua and Silk.   Kiki is eventually going to drop down and take one of those spots (even though she performs admirably up front) with Jeunese probably sliding back into the position she stole from him in the first place. It's when Nerua and Avnore come into play that decisions become harder. I use Nerua for her HP totem, and Crit/CA resist totems, rather than her WW/Light reduction. It allows her to be on the same line as Magnus, but it also puts her into direct competition with Kiki. I'm pretty sure Kiki wins that competition on Jin teams.   Avnore is only looking at a spot because that debuff of his is so amazing and I can see how useful it would be to have. Silk is where she is because I've found her far more useful in the back. I run Silk ace because both my mid and front rely heavily on winning the reflex war. Malcolm is the backline penetrator not much to say there.  While I'm at it, do you guys think Princess Meiran would be better in Linmay's spot? Linmay provides a Forward pass, the same totem as Princes M. and she's a better thief. Princess M., on the other hand, is a spirit generator, provides a team wide totem, has a useful active and is better at taking hits. Both would do well in that spot I'm just asking to see if anyone has some insight or experience with them at later stages of the game."
soccerspirits,3d6fs9,lastra1,0,Tue Jul 14 09:23:16 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure your def is Nerua - Kiki - Malcolm are definite. With other unmovable, Silk your backline is more or less set in stone. Avn's debuff is amazing indeed, but doesn't really affect the game greatly unless you stack him with similars. Magnus is also not a good buffer as the other two since only works on certain opponnents.  I'll also add that the closest team to yours is the one that RobertLee uses and Magnus doesn't really protect him from Sharrs."

soccerspirits,3d6fs9,lastra1,0,Tue Jul 14 08:38:03 2015 UTC,"You won't need Eden or Sammy, since their roles double with Jury. While I'm more of a Sammy fan for her beastly reflex and boobs, Jury has seemingly many fans as well.  I'm also not fan of Guin front. While she's a good totem, she can't do much except that and bashing opponents with sheer power alone, meaning she has low reflex and can't counter. That said, using Veronica won't increase your damage, but will make you crit more reliably against PvP anti-critters as well as counter when you fail to OHKO.  Other than that, you just need to try better at ST and EE. Also try to find TA boosting managers if you don't have, such as Lucy, Gerold or Clover. Lucy and Gero will give you 330 TA if you didn't have them earlier while Clover only 220, but she's easier to superb up to 440."

soccerspirits,3d6fs9,lastra1,0,Tue Jul 14 09:03:46 2015 UTC,"I only chose from what you have. For late game I'll also add two things.  First, I'd chage your front totem too... Silla. Yes, Silla. While her totem skills are awesome and cooperate with Hiro well, her pass is the weakest among EE passers. Inserting Nari/Nera/Baltheon instead of Veronicas main passerts will boost your sheer damage quite well. None of them are Light/Thunder, but all of them have good reflex.  Secondly, a back penetrator. No, not Mikael or Yuri that are totems doubling for penetrators, a real one. Even Anael is better, she may not have HP buff, but double attack and great reflex work well for her and with full superbs, she can one-shot too. Other choices are Malcolm or Lucius who also have double attacks, but are not L/T. Bell and Khirell are legends. Utility Hilde could be good too, but you will probably need her in mid. Comparing to them, Mikael has no helpful skills except for minor damage boos, but end-game PvP, when most players have high superbs, damage is around the last thing you need for a penetrator, because most of them can one-shot without much trying. What Mikael lacks is reflex. While you can think he has some because of his buff, it will be nothing comparing to end-game stealers with 1.8k+ reflex. With Yuri and Nerua buff he may be usable, but not most reliable out there and existance of reliable back penetrator is what saves you from consecutive shots and allows you to start your own offensive.  For further analysis and proof of above, watch some of the high-end vids."

soccerspirits,3d6fs9,xunus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:27:29 2015 UTC,"I am running Light/ardor team with sammy as my ace and Hiro as striker , I hope someone can clear my doubts :  1) Is ST'ing White Guardenia worth it ?   From the matches I played with her in my team, Even FSTU cant penetrate her but when she has the ball she is sh!t , Her reflex and speed is literally worse than 4* cards. But I dont know why I like her lol.  2) Is Lilith (EE) worth in light ardor team ?  I have decent amount of success with her in my team having her in support slot . But as she is dark ,she doesn't get benefits from ace. She get penetrated easily when she is not counterattacking.  3) To ST or Not to ST Lucian ?  I am disappointed by Lucian currently ,He gets oneshotted a lot, One of the main reason being Lucian is not FST . Should I scout Kei , wait for Nute  or FST Lucian ?  4) Light/Ardor or Light/Thunder ?  Ardor player I am using are Lucius,Nari,Lucian , thunder players are Nerua,Jury,Eden.In my opinion Jury in CM is one of the best card, It makes easier for my lucius to penetrate. Only reason I am using sammy ace is for Lucian (f*cking lightball no EE -_- ) Otherwise Cancer ace would be god send to Jury.  5) Current Problems I am having with my team :  My Forward cant hold the ball,they get penetrated everytime ball is not with Hiro .   In mid though they can hold the ball on thier own esp. by Jury Only problem there is Lucius being paper while being penetrated .  Backline is decent but I dont have any penetrator there, so ball usually stays in backline if sammy has her active in cooldown which is super risky against some team running infinity turn striker . Only penetrators  I have are Lucius and  Shu.  This is my team formation:          Nari(EE) Kevin(E) Hiro(EE FSTU)   Lucius(EE) Jury(E) White G.(E)   Sammy(EE) Nerua(E) Eden(E FSTU)    Lucian(E)     Support: Lilith(EE)  Bench : Shu(EE) , Milky way ( just scouted) , Jeun (E) , Virgil (E) , Latios ,Silk(E), Clarisa"
soccerspirits,3d6fs9,Murol,2,Tue Jul 14 05:01:28 2015 UTC,"Okay i'll bite.   Try this formation:          Nari Jury Hiro   Shu in support slot Sammy as CM Milky Way Kevin   HP totem Nerua Lucius    GK     Your backline is the weakest at the moment. Lucian is viable as a GK in PVP but he needs many HP totems and you need to give him crit resistance. You have some of both in Nerua but not enough to really matter. You can add more crit resistance with spirit stones (long term) or with Silk as her first passive (iirc) affects the entire position. Alternatively, you can use Clarisa or Latios as HP totems. Although at low levels, you'll still struggle because most people are MSPUing their strikers first and GKs die pretty fast. It's really up to you whether you want to invest in Lucian and lock yourself into playing light/ardor. Kei or Isilla would allow you more flexibility with aces.   For that reason, I'm going to suggest a Shu - Sammy - MW - Kevin mid line aimed at preventing them from getting there in the first place. Sammy can ball hold if you max her last passive. MW is a good speed + reflex totem who works esp well when paired up with Kevin. Kevin also helps set up Shu. Shu is also a huge spirit generator, which Hiro likes.   Frontline is gonna be bit odd. Normally you'd put someone who can buff the striker or the line, but I'm going to suggest Jury in place of Kevin. Jury can ball hold and in that position, she can inflict additional damage to the GK."
soccerspirits,3d6fs9,Soziele,2,Tue Jul 14 07:23:20 2015 UTC,"1) Not really, more levels will make her Reflexes even lower.  Guardenia is just a wall that passes now and then, just use her to block off a line since the only penetrator that can touch her is Lucius.  2) Not really worth it, Milky Way will do the job better but you'll have to shuffle some positions since Milky defaults to frontline when she supports  3)  You should be looking to replace Lucian with Kei, or more accurately have both of them and swap as necessary.  When you are up against a WW striker or one that relies heavily on crit chance (Hiro, Blade, William) you can tag Lucian in.  4) Light/Ardor, since I would recommend dropping Eden to help with your problem in question 5, which just leaves Jury and Nerua off-color which is perfectly acceptable  5) All penetrators get flattened if they are the ones that get hit lategame, you can just hope they do some good damage in return.  For your backline having no penetrator and no long pass is asking for trouble, any line that outspeeds you will abuse your defenders.  I would drop Eden for Shu, between Shu and Sammy while the ball is in your hands you'll have some good action speed advantage against all but the fastest of teams.  Shu also has pretty good reflexes to counterattack and keep the ball in his hands if a utility striker tries to take it from him."

soccerspirits,3d6fs9,Articfreezer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:31:47 2015 UTC,"If you have the resources to spare I'd say get Jeunese. One of the best cheese characters that can help out with high health Pve opponents.   I don't think striker is a desperate priority. B. Dragon is in my opinion the best 4 star striker out there. Even if you get a striker you're probably better off with B. Dragon until you get a few superbs and levels. Combined with Silla pass and Veronica crit buff, and I don't think your front line is that bad. All the lines looke pretty balanced.  That's not to say that a striker isn't a higher priority then Jeun. It is, and you should look to evolve some units, Silla and Malcolm being the first two in my mind. But if you have enough GP than might as well go for it, since Jeun can help out later by cheesing things like super bosses."

soccerspirits,3d6fs9,Articfreezer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:52:19 2015 UTC,"Well, she is a 4 star after all. I still think she beats some non superbed 5 stars but you will have to replace her.   I really think you should prioritize Silla or Malcolm over Shu in regards to evolution. The reason being Shu in the backline, meaning he'll see the ball less, and with a strong penetration or pass you'll win faster, and whats not to like about winning faster?  Not to mention Malcolm and Silla are both potential aces for your team. Evolved Silla ace will help you stomp elemental matches and is just fantastic in general so for that reason I recommend her first.  Remember you have to keep team cost in mind. A evolution of both Malcom and Silla one level will being you to 153 and Shu's first evolution beings his cost up 7, so you can evolve all of them to 160, but it'll be hard to evolve someone after that without levels/Jiyun."
soccerspirits,3d6fs9,Villori,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:19:58 2015 UTC,I said Shu because of the Tuesday elemental match which is Ardor. I almost have all the elementals for Malcolm but didn't have enough time last week.  I have 164 points and only use 137 with my current team so I think I'll have enough.

I would pass, he's more of an extra that could help your team and isn't a vital part. He's fun but it's more of something you get after you know what your team setup is and if you'd benefit from him"

soccerspirits,3d6fs9,theKONSTER,2,Tue Jul 14 01:05:55 2015 UTC,"Swap positions of Veronica and Jury, then maybe Jury and Silla. Jury is a good CM, esp in colo where her passive 15% health drain can shine. Other than that, EE your Silla ASAP and make her your ace.

soccerspirits,3d6fs9,xAsura,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:31:25 2015 UTC,Okay yeah I was thinking that as well. However I only do auto-PvP 4 times a day for the daily. Pretty much only do Space-Time/Colo. Will Lucid still be a bad choice? I did recently pick up Beatrice.
soccerspirits,3d6fs9,lastra1,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:14:06 2015 UTC,"Lucid is very good striker. With Eclipse, she can be top class in both speed and power department, making her to be known as the PvE queen, but crap tier for auto PvP.  Sooner or later, you will want to do well in PvP, you will want to put effort into another striker then, because Littres are precious."

soccerspirits,3d6fs9,Yuujya,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:14:54 2015 UTC,"I'm currently completely satisfied with my Ardor/WW team, as I have gotten to F44 in Colo. F44 still too hard.. Btw drew Elaine in 10+1 and I'm happy, though is there any room for her with Kirin striker and Neraizel? I'm using Kevin in PVP and Kiki in PVE as forward totems. If Elaine is a good choice, how should I skill her + stone slots (I have Silent Cold)."
soccerspirits,3d6fs9,Soziele,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:56:52 2015 UTC,"Elaine makes for a pretty powerful totem and thief, I would say she is better than Kevin but worse than Kiki.  The big difference is Elaine has a very good chance to steal if the enemy attempts to break through her since she doubles her Reflexes when she is attacked.  Also makes her a stellar ball holder.  Silent Cold is a no-brainer to boost line damage, I'd also run her with the Ardor Reflex/Crit Resist and either Dark Steal/Spirit or Dark Action Speed/Crit Resist.  Prism slot for more Reflexes or Speed depending on what you want her to be doing.  Skill her 5/0/1/5 for a goalie sniper that can keep getting the ball back for Kirin, or 1/0/5/5 for a more totem-like build."
soccerspirits,3d6fs9,Yuujya,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:31:26 2015 UTC,"First of all, thank you very much for your detailed response. It's most appreciated. One last question is left in Elaine's case, as I need a definition for her active. Is it the same as penetration power? Almost every attempt of mine in Colo was to attempt stealing with Kiki, not waiting until being penetrated, though that's been another possible steal. The flat disadvantage for stealing by being penetrated is that you can lose the ball afterwards."
soccerspirits,3d6fs9,Soziele,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:59:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not 100% sure on her active functionality.  I think it is a damage bonus applied before resistance is taken into account, and doesn't count as penetration but I'm not certain of how the equation works for this skill in particular.  She is a bit riskier against fast backlines, since they can just hit her again once she steals and break through.  Any line that you outrun though (and with Kirin that is quite a few of them) she is very strong against.  Situational power, but she's a good option to have around."
soccerspirits,3d6fs9,Yuujya,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:25:33 2015 UTC,"Her active should be clearly defined or explained for me cause I have Glabaris on Kirin. You see, the active won't be useful if I have pretty much enough penetration power to bypass most dmg reduction builds. But from what I've seen, she is decreasing the dmg reduction with her active. It can even get into negative values if the dmg reduction was too little. How should I skill her in this regard, more reflex with her third passive?"
soccerspirits,3d6fs9,Soziele,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:32:56 2015 UTC,"Keep her third passive maxed out for counterattacking and ball holding, then use one of her two line boosts instead of her active.  I like Strategic Behavior a bit more personally for the pass effect boost (it also lasts longer) but you can use Match Analysis instead if you need more crit rate."
soccerspirits,3d6fs9,Yuujya,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:42:56 2015 UTC,PS: Using 3/5/5/0 on her IMO. It decreases the dmg reduction by a multiplicative value.
soccerspirits,3d6fs9,Yuujya,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:43:11 2015 UTC,"Once again, I'll report to you. Tested Elaine and her third passive is useless, as it only procs on being penetrated. She has bout 800 reflex with one +12 red reflex stone and I'm using two speed stones (dark, green). She might be good after 3spu tho.. However my Kirin becomes almighty against any attacker with less than 1.5k HP."
soccerspirits,3d6fs9,Soziele,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:41:44 2015 UTC,"Good to know for that passive, since by wording it seemed that her third passive worked when she was the target of a steal as well as a penetration."
soccerspirits,3d6fs9,Yuujya,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:32:04 2015 UTC,I have actually not noticed any difference in reflex when she is being stealt from. However her HP pool is so scarce that even then she won't survive.

soccerspirits,3d6fs9,lastra1,0,Mon Jul 13 23:44:21 2015 UTC,"You can use Choi as your totem. While he needs to pass first to become one, his totem skills and general usefunless is one of the highest.  Note that you ace is (should be) Sammy or Metatron, both are light aces, so Hiro is you best choice as long as he has Silla support him as either passer or totem.  Drop Muspel, move Malcolm left and CM Metatron. You couls use Malcolm or Lucius in the back to penetrate, both are very good. For PvP, you may as well drop Malcolm and put Sammy LM. As for other defenders, look for some good HP totems like Kiki, Nerua or Yuri."
soccerspirits,3d6fs9,theKONSTER,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:40:03 2015 UTC,"Do you have anyone in mine you want to replace Luka with? What other 5 star assists do you have? If its Guin I would advise against, 5 star assists are in most cases essential for your striker and in line passers are quite rare. Luka is scheduled to get an EE too so you might want to wait for it. Silla is moreso used as a totem and for her ace. You can switch out Muspel for Guin though.  As for strikers the two are pretty similar in strength. It comes down to preference and what element you want to build your team around. Its up to you."
soccerspirits,3d6fs9,deamonkiller,2,Tue Jul 14 02:14:35 2015 UTC,"Its about time I start giving my players some spirit stones.  Naturally I'd want them all to use 5* and 6* stones, however right now I have only several of those (and over 80 of the other lower grades).What is the minimum spirit stone grade I should consider to be worth my time in powering up and combining to reach the 6* limit?  Obviously it'd be madness (and a huge waste of resources) to try and rank up a stone from 1-2* to 5-6... What about 3-4 however?"
soccerspirits,3d6fs9,Shahadah,3,Mon Jul 13 23:07:44 2015 UTC,"If you have marineco, then you will essentially be flooded with 5~6* stones (can't speak for everyone here but I have 30+ unused 6* stones). I level up all 4* stones to +6. I level 5* to +9 if they are stones that I need and +12 if I desperately need that type. Generally, from my experience, It's costly to combine 5* stones and there's no guarenteeing you will get what you wanted. 4* combinations are much cheaper and there is a good chance that they will turn into 6*. Anything below 4 I sell. Essentially, you should equip all your players with min 4 star stones and replace them as time goes along."

soccerspirits,3d6fs9,vrainsworth,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:22:36 2015 UTC,it's fine to upgrade 3/4s to +6 since that's pretty cheap; really good 4s you can upgrade to +9. Beyond that it's usually not worth it.

In Plat, enemies will be S/lower SS rank and that's not an enemy you can't defeat, though you may not win all the matches.  /u/Dysoth with a bit lower TA got into it, so you can do it too ;D Chances are that you can still do it if you do one free tournament a day, but in practice, just play league when you don't have time to keep arena streak xd"

soccerspirits,3d21ok,lastra1,0,Tue Jul 14 07:49:15 2015 UTC,"While I think that formation is fine in PvE, in PvP you will have a bit hard time to counter. For that sake, sheer stealing power may be better than reflex/pass. As such, Baltheon and Nera are probably in  good positions.  Regardless of your ace, you will love Nerua. If your ace is Lia, you will be looking for Yuri and Lucius. Magnus will help you fend off Ardor strikers. Lucian for GK, since Jin is legend and Hyunmy is non-scoutable, however Lucian doesn't have EE, so you may want to keep Isillia, but she's not too suited for PvP. If for some reason, you decide that you don't want Nera CM after all, you may want Meiran instead."

soccerspirits,3d21ok,lastra1,0,Tue Jul 14 05:44:59 2015 UTC,"Firstly, Nerua > Yuri, especially with your Zibroi, since Nerua provides crit resist and light/ww resistance over what Yuri can do.  Secondlt, Linmay and Veronica both have Inspiring which won't stack (unless you evolved only one of them). Among what you have, one thing I'd bet on is Silla, who simply has more reflex and more utility, but can't say she's any tougher than Veronica. What you should be looking for is probably Meiran, but she also is possesor of Inspiring. As such, you may think about trading Linmay for another player as well.  You can also use Linmay mid, she has good reflex too, but not as good as Silla, however she will get ace bonus. Either way, you will trade Veronica away. You can add some Bird in PvP and Nari in PvE, because in PvE, penetration support will be more useful than second penetrator himself."

soccerspirits,3d21ok,Azioria,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:42:12 2015 UTC,"One way to increase your score by a large amount is to increase speed at which you finish matches. Considering you only have a 6.6k TA, I assume for many matches, especially late 20s and early 30s, its taking a while for Ravian to burn down the opposing GK, which is why your score is pretty low. Score also scales with how much damage your MVP (Ravian) did, but Ravian naturally has low MVP score due to her nature as a striker."
soccerspirits,3d21ok,Nyurashi,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:21:38 2015 UTC,"ty for answering. I'm running ravian with 1,6k reflex, so she has most of the time 60% CA chance. With a lil'bit luck are many matches over after 10min ingametime. But cuz I'm using many front-/longpasser is Ravian as you say my MVP. I think Gravity Down is not included in MVP Score, as ist is only 20% lifesteal and with active she makes only 1,5k crits. So as long as I am using her, the score will stay low. And i don`t really want to exchange her.."

Alkyde is the new one in. I previously used Veronica (0/5) on her place but I figured that Alkyde's reflex debuff (-30%) would be as valuable as Victorias totem. Then add her ability to pass directly to Ravian and her better reflexes (at least superbed) I figured it would be a good trade.   Victorias contribution to the line is her reflex totem and Baltheon actually has pretty good reflexes and stats. I don't get much value out of his active pass though since I have sacrificed Ravians crit rate.  Anything I missed? Am I on to something here, or was it stupid to try and max Alkyde? :P"
soccerspirits,3d21ok,vrainsworth,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:17:13 2015 UTC,"I remember seeing your post about this frontline. IMO it should do well until you get to higher leagues.   Based on my experience running a 2k reflex Nari stealing against sub-1000 reflex defenders, you can't depend too much on reflex front in higher diamond. This is because many people run at least 1, or a full combo of Yuri, Nerua, and Anael (first 2 being super common). Your chance of stealing in higher tiers is usually lower than 50%.  ^ So just something to think about. I would go with a 4man mid/back as you progress because well-composed backlines will break through. A speedy/action bar midline (Metatron or Milky for example) that can repeatedly bring the ball to Ravian will be very dangerous."
soccerspirits,3d21ok,ChrisKott,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:03:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply!  Yes, I have asked about this line once before, but most people couldn't see past the Balth vs Alkyde comparison, which wasn't my point (I might have formulated the question poorly back then).   Your answer is interesting (especially based on your experience!). So you basically say that a high reflex line is bad in the higher ranks? I'm currently 9.2k-ish in TA and slowly advancing towards diamond.  The problem with reflex is that it will never get better than 60%, which makes every game a gamble. But I honestly don't know how to otherwise use my maxed Ravian.  How do higher rank players use her? Is she even common in diamond and such?   But I do admit, since I moved to a 4-man forward line, my mid has been suffering.  I currently use Beth - Silla (Ace) - Malcolm as midline. Had so sacrifice Zibroi as CM in order to move a player up to forward. No Metatron (would be an instant ace in my team) or Milky way though.  (Backline: Just for completions sake: Aneal - Yuri - Mikael. GK: Kei. )"
soccerspirits,3d21ok,vrainsworth,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:26:46 2015 UTC,"she is getting more and more common in league, I'd say she's around 3rd most common in diamond now, behind hiro and beatrice  the ravian teams that gave me trouble just forgo crit and reflex completely (since you definitely can't crit, and reflex is a gamble indeed). instead they focus on outlasting their opponent (ravian usually needs max 3 shots) with very annoying mid/backlines.  typically I can deal with annoying midlines since I run Duke - Lia - Milky - Lucius which has enough speed/reflex/action bar control, but the teams with heavy speed backline is what wrecks me.  It's almost always a combination of Kiki, Avnore, Nerua/Magnus, and Alice, with Zib/Jin GK. That backline has so much speed advantage on you (they can move before my 52% Ignition Catalyst Nari) that it can completely wipe your striker/assist before you get a chance to shoot.  Those teams also like to run Jeunese with Ravian. Quick Start + 100 speed Ravian means she usually go first, then Jeunese himself takes 600 HP out of a 2k6 Lucian which is not fun at all.  Not to mention Metatron mid which can win games by herself."

Floor 31 is only difficult because Latios heals there, but it can be overrided by Malcolming her. If you do that, it will be Sharr that would shoot. Always. Agaisnt Sharr, Kei's reduction works great. You may want some more stones for that as well as more superbs. Avnore is obvious, add Kevin for more action/reduction, but ideally get a Sammy. Note that you may want to use Zibroi instead of Kei, because you don't have enough heals. Otherwise, equip Kei with two light crit rate stones for healing and equi Malcolm with light crit rate and dark crit damage stones.  In mid use Bell on the right side. Because she's Bell. Add two lols to support Bell, because they Lol. Lilith's healing and anael's attack buff can do the job. Because Bell is Bell.  In front, use Silla/Veronica/Lev, with this, you will have more chance to steal/counter. You can't kill with one shot, so you prepare for second shot.  With that, you have 5 stealers in mid/front and solid right side passage to use in case ball fell back to your defense."

soccerspirits,3d21ok,lastra1,0,Mon Jul 13 20:48:57 2015 UTC,"AS/HP doesn't help as much as healing based on damage and Bell does have great damage. You probably don't need stones on Lilith main purpose is buffing and she will rarely have chance to steal. You can try with Kiki if you want, but you will want some healing stones on Bell instead.  Strategy itself is definitely viable (I do it on auto), but before doing anything, you lack sub-healer and some superbs on GK."
soccerspirits,3d21ok,garguybbj,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:17:12 2015 UTC,"Ok, so first off, you should probably consider SPU your Kei before anyone else. Goalkeepers are the second most important single player in a team behind strikers. Furthermore, Kei especially really needs some SPU investment to be strong.  Next up, you really don't need two attackers in mid, unless you are only using Mikael as a totem. If you feel like your midfield is being stolen from, you can put some reflex stones on your attackers, though I don't see a reflex problem if you are using both Inspiring II and Army's Mark for reflexes. Veronica can also use her 2nd, new passive which decreases inflicted damage if you are using her as ballholder.  Using Anael and Nerua in defense simultaneously is redundant, as you don't need two stealers, and Anael isn't a very good totem anyways. You may want to switch Anael and Kiki, so that Kei gets Kiki's buffs and your frontline gets the extra attack boost, plus the counterattack resistance means that you can use Leventor to penetrate once before shooting, which will increase the chance of a OHKO, especially with Cold Heart passive.   In your defense, you can definitely put a few Litters into Bell; this will solve your Coliseum problem, as Bell makes a really solid attacker in manual mode. She has a 80% attack increase passive stacking THRICE, which makes her an OP attacker. However, her leader AI might be dumb in PvP, nonetheless, she's a really good unit to invest in."
soccerspirits,3d21ok,Fasgort,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:51:14 2015 UTC,"Since you are being owned by Hiros and other strikers, I'd move Kiki to the backline so you have more health there.

soccerspirits,3d21ok,vrainsworth,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:51:49 2015 UTC,"i wrote a bit about roina in a previous help thread, i'll just copypaste:   I have Roina, and she's rather weak. She does have a neat gimmick which is the 15% HP damage that can cut a considerable amount off 4k HP Jins, annoying turtles, and pretty much any GK with Silla ace effect (the other Ardor attackers can't hit as hard on GKs).   The hp% attack is actually really good (roina 0superb hits Jin for 600 while my max superb Lucius struggles to hit 300), but she is not good for penning through mid especially without a pass. So she isn't worth it unless your striker really have trouble killing high HP keepers/ keepers with Silla ace (and if you do use her you would want to pair her with a real damage dealer like Malcolm)."
soccerspirits,3d21ok,garguybbj,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:09:29 2015 UTC,"Overall, I agree with Pikamonchu. She is a very self-centered attacker with passives that increase receiving pass effect and her own output when penetrating. As an attacker, her skillset is actually pretty good, and she can dish out some damage. However, just like other attackers, she is not sturdy at all, and even for attackers her stats are quite low, especially her HP, which she suffers from the lack of. She might be practical in a mono ardor team, but even then you've got Lucius and Shu, who are much better attackers. Even some leaders like Elise are better than her. Especially since you're Ardor/Dark, you have many attackers which are much better than her (Malcolm, Gerrald, Dale, etc.)."

I was wondering if I'm using everyone in an optimal position and if there is anyone in particular I should be scouting. I've been thinking about flipping my front 3 to be Ravian or Kirin focused but I've invested a lot into Lucid already. I guess, I have a lot of ""would Lilith be better than X here"", ""would Dale be better than Z here"" type questions going around in my head. Any advice would be welcome.

soccerspirits,3d21ok,lastra1,0,Mon Jul 13 17:33:57 2015 UTC,"Your Dark/WW is as standard as it can be. One thing I think it lacks is a way to get the ball out of defense. Linmay is not bad, but she can only use forward pass once per 15 min. For position of back penetrator, I always suggest Malcolm, because he is suitable for that key position with his sheer damage (super play combined with cruelity), reliability (super play and dark stone slots) and utility (spirit break). If you decide to use him as such, Dale will do well to replace him in mid.  Also while Linmay would double her role with Malcolm, she is still a very good healer, so you may drop Magnus in PvE, but Linmay in PvP. In lengthy PvE matches, against high HP/speed, but low power opponents, healing is more useful, but PvP opponents aren't as sturdy, but mostly are strong enough to one-shot most of your non-tank units. That's why healing takes priority in PvE while HP dominates PvP defense lines.  I'll also add that you may prefer Sammy over Linmay, her tankiness, reflexes and healing abilities exceed that of Linmay by far. She's also only unit I'd suggest off color/rainbow. And Yuri for being lovely totem.  You can also use Ravian - Alkyde - Victoria for another classic front. Lucid is bad in PvP, but she may be useful against anti-critters. Ravian and Kirin are too reliant on front stealing, you front can do that well, but there are also plenty of ways to prevent that in PvP. The only other striker left is Beatrice with no visible weaknesses except being plainly normal while Lucid, Rvian and Kirin are all special/utility types, Beatrice is just pure power, and very effective at that."

soccerspirits,3d21ok,Wahuh,2,Mon Jul 13 18:26:14 2015 UTC,"No worries, if you like Guin you should read this guide (courtesy of /u/MarisaChu): https://www.reddit.com/r/soccerspirits/comments/2xibem/guinevere_the_guide/  She is a potent striker if you want to use her as one. Also my bad for forgetting you had Kiki, yeah you can run Bea-Silla-Guin and put Kiki at LB or CB.  As for Shu I would max Fantasy Star anyway since its great even on single targets. Since he's your only real penetrator mid you want to put him at the side to have the best chance of breaking through (your priority is to get the ball to Buttrice who will end the game). Attacking more than 1 unit gives him more dmg but he also takes more damage and its harder to break through. The tankiest units are usually put CM while the lower HP DPS ones are at the side, these are the ones you wanna penetrate."

Lots of new EEs as well (which is awesome). Anyway, I'd like to get some outside opinions and sugestions on my team, to see what I should focus on developing right now. Currently I'm rank 67 with 220/225 max team cost (6500 teamscore).          5* Beatrice (EE;3 supbs; +90) 5* Silla 5* Yuri (EE)   5* Skorn (E;1 supb) 5* Mikael 5* Lucius   5* Anael (EE; 3supbs) 4* Eden(2 supbs) 5* Virgil(E;1 supb)    5* Jin (EE)     5* Rasiel as 11th player in the CM position (next to Mikael) for pvp. If I haven't mentioned anything in brackets about a superb/evo/+stats on a character, then that means he's simply not developed in that area.  All 5* bench players: Zibroi, Dale, Alkyde, Herc, Latios, Elizabeth, Merian, Kirin, Griffith, Lynia, Beta, Veronica, Erica, Sharr, Jacob, Bora.  Notable 4* bench players: Valkia, Ami, Durahan, Didi, Rudy (max superbs and evo), Mira, Mimi, White Tiger, Juno, Ari, Siegfried.

soccerspirits,3d21ok,lastra1,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:00:58 2015 UTC,"I think you may want to go WW/Ardor hybrid as a long term goal. You have good WW base and some Ardor players, but not enough to complete the team. You can also go mono-WW. So first things first, concentrating on WW/Ardor your PvE team would look like this (potential scouts in brackets)[potential PvP replacements]:          Bea/Sharr Yuri Silla(Neraizel/Nari)   Valkia/Ami/Anael(Birdie) Meiran Lucius   Mimi(Linmay)[Kiki/Magnus] Mira[Nerua] Mikael    Jin     I took a second look at that and on your player list and for some reason, I think your rainbow team would look the same with priority on Anael LM.  As general strategy, you may want to use Lucius in the back for penetrating. Mikael can do that, but he is no specialist and not nearly as strong/reliable as Lucius. But that's when you a mid penetrator too."

In fact, drop Elizabeth if you haven't superbed her and put in Valkia. Her spirit eater is pure evil and she's dark. You will want to build a Light/Dark deck centered on Metatron.  If you were to use Elizabeth, try Queen's Benevolence and Space Disortion first. Her totem skill is not too good because she needs to pass first and is time limited. She is more of a reflex stealer. As such, you may want to play her in mid rather than front, when she successfully steals, she can pass to frontline player to buff them (when you get more skill points)."

You can swap Nari for any tanky passer you got. And the position in front is to take advantage of Ravian's positional bonus (I'd never take her out of  RWF).  Mid section has a lot of play, I'm not a big fan of Shu so you can swap him out with Dale once you get him up to speed (Dale has a really good spirit generator skill) While the rest depends on how strong your mid players are, my strat would be build spirit with Dale and have Silla pass to either Mikael or Dale to break through.   As for the back, it will be really reliant on trying to steal everything back so you can swap out depending if you want to reflex steal or we can have Jury in CB and use her -15% health skill to chip away the attacker.   Mostly what I could figure so far in short time, give it a shot and let me know!"
soccerspirits,3d21ok,lastra1,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:42:19 2015 UTC,"Mid too weak? Move kiki back and add Juri CM, she's tanky one and attacking her can sometimes be a bad idea. If you have superbs on her, she's likely to reach awesomeness. She's the only tank you need since others have different roles.  Kevin (you don't EE Kevins) is only good when played in combos. While he may have some synergy with Mariel, it can't realy be called combo, at least not too effective in PvP. Move Kiki to replace Mariel and add Magnus to replace Kevin what will give Isillia and your backline max takiness. You may add Kevin as support here. Unlike your current defense line, with Kiki and Magnus you will have good speed stat in addition to quick start, but also those two can be a real pain when they move before enemy's front line.  AS for Ravian, it's pretty far from what can be called optimal reflex Ravian. Reflex Ravian is when you use your line to buff Ravian's reflex, not use other players' reflexes. While both Nari and Silla have very good reflex, the main heroine - Ravian is left without any help to use her instant counter -> shoot combo. You will want to replace either passer with Alkyde and another reflex buff/debuff player like Veronica or Victoria what will be optimal for so called Reflex Ravian. Having that said, you can't exactly get rid of Silla since she's probably your ace there, so for now Alkyde - Ravian - Silla would be good choice."

soccerspirits,3d21ok,frozensinx,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:36:07 2015 UTC,"You'll only ever have 1 team unless your a whale and spend heaps on money on the game, generally mono and hybrid teams are much better than rainbow teams but again the reason people run rainbow is because they simply don't have the means to create a good mono/hybrid team. Honestly i suggest you try aiming for a hybrid (2 colour) team since their ace effects are much better than rainbows and more flexible since you can choose from 2 colours instead of 1"
soccerspirits,3d21ok,lastra1,0,Mon Jul 13 16:00:34 2015 UTC,"Mono teams are only better because they have best aces. Hybrids are not far behind while rainbows are dead end.  However, considering flexibility and easiness-to-complete, the raking goes upside down. Specific roles in team is what matters the most in the endgame, if you can find all you need within one color, that's when mono is the best, otherwise hybrids are better.   Another reason for some mono being better is team-wide mono buff passive like the one that was given to Neraizel, Latios or Nerua.  In the endgame, you won't have to need 6 teams, you just use one for PvP and second for PvE with most of the players doing both. PvE opponents are different than PvP ones, so you will changing few units around will be beneficial even if they aren't your color of choice. Having 6 teams is bad from efficiency point of view since upgrading one player takes a lot of time and work."
soccerspirits,3d21ok,wingleberry,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:46:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah there's some guides on here for self referrals that you can look up on how to do the referral process yourself if you want, basically involves making a HIVE account on your main, deleting the game/re downloading, making a new account then bringing back your old account.  And you won't have the resources (mainly 5 star litres) to have 6 end game teams, people tend to find a color based on what good 5* draws they get and start investing once they have a decent team/are really sure what direction they want to go. Mono teams are good, but typically hybrid teams (Hybrid aces like Lia/Hiro/Saramir) are debatably a little stronger and easier to set up since you have two colors to work with, and most teams still run players like Kiki, Bell, or Baltheon off color because they're so valuable."
soccerspirits,3d21ok,Marcus_Maximus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:46:14 2015 UTC,I think most people usually have only one end game team or atleast they'd develop one team at a time. Hybrid should still be pretty viable end game but don't take my word for it.

Her AI is bad though since she's attacker type but she's one of the few people you can use on ANY team.  Isillia is also a very strong GK who can bring you to endgame.  I'd say keep.  Just farm 1600 GP and look for a striker in scout.  With Sammy you can go ardor/light too so there's that.

soccerspirits,3d21ok,khrawn,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:59:04 2015 UTC,"That's actually pretty nice, but a few complications.  For example if you chose to go light/thunder hybrid you need Hiro which is a striker, so that's counterinituitive, and if you do i'd almost suggest using Hiro over Blade. Blade is strongest in a mono-thunder team, with Nerua + Veronica but you GK can easely be other coloured. Anyway, i suggest you use Blade for now, but be on the lookout for a better striker, so don't use your littre's or beelzebubs or anything on her just yet, you are still in the early game."

Couldn't you use her in a non mono thunder team but just make someone else the ace? Also if we're talking about mono thunder or hybrid teams, are all 11 members of the team usually thunder or whatever hybrid, or if you have the key few members, it's OK to use other off element but strong units?"
soccerspirits,3d21ok,khrawn,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:38:35 2015 UTC,"What makes it so that Blade can only be used in Mono thunder? Her Ace skull?    It's not that she can only be used in a mono thunder it's just that thunder is in a weird situation. There are no Dark/Thunder leads so you can't do that, there are no Ardor/Thunder leads so you can't do that either. In order to go light/thunder you need Hiro as a said, which means going double striker, which, while it can work is very weird, and if you want to go thunder/WW you need the newest card added to the game Niki, whom you can only get from draw, which is why the only real thing you have left is Mono thunder. I hope this clears it up.  You can of course use her in a rainbow team while using an Ace such as Silla, Malcolm, Hildegard, Yuri or whatever rainbow ace you posess. This is what i would do if i was you, at least, untill you decide which team you want to form.   Couldn't you use her in a non mono thunder team but just make someone else the ace?   Yes, you can, but, a lot of people are using Ace's which increase their teams damage, so if say, you use a WW ace which increases WW reflex and attack power by 30% your striker will lose out on a 30% damage increase, while another person with the same WW Ace but Kirin or Beatrice striker will have and increased 30% damage over your striker. Since your striker is your primary way to deal damage to the enemy Goalkeeper that's a lot of damage to miss out on. Some rainbow aces like Silla though are purely defensive but still very good as they secure your Goalkeeper or other units won't die to the first hit.   Also if we're talking about mono thunder or hybrid teams, are all 11 members of the team usually thunder or whatever hybrid, or if you have the key few members, it's OK to use other off element but strong units?   It depends a lot on the units available, for example a lot of people use Jin or Kei as their goalkeeper with the rest 10 units being thunder, or they have Yuri/Kiki/Magnus/Mikael or other totems so their team might only be 6/11 or 7/11 thunder, but still considered ""mono"". If you go mono you want to aim for key members, this for thunder means that you will want Luka as she's the main passer for thunder, you will want Hildegard or Guin for penetrating, Eden for stealing, Nerua and Veronica for their teamwide buffs, maybe Cynthia for her buffs too, Bell is a useful legend for stealing. Basicly a ""mono"" thunder team might look like this:          Blade Iggy Luka   Veronica Jury Guinevere   Kiki Nerua Hildegard    Kei     With a Magnus support.   So this team has 8/11 thunder players but i'd easely consider it mono thunder if that makes sense. The reason why Iggy is top is because of the high crit chance she gives which blade needs, while Veronica provides a great damage boost to Blade even though she isn't even in the lane with her, Nerua on the other hand isn't that good since her main force is providing defensive buffs to the goalkeeper but in her EE'd form she provides a defensive buff to all thunder players, but Kei won't receive that, so in this case you might actually want to replace Nerua with Mikael or Yuri, for usefull buffs.  Of course, Ardor, WW, Light and Dark has other ""core"" players than thunder has. But i hope this helped a bit."
soccerspirits,3d21ok,fokxe,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:19:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, this helps a ton, thank you! If you don't mind, I have a few questions about evolutions. I'm coming from Rage of Bahamut a while ago and been playing Brave Frontier since then, so I have a general idea of powering up players/evolving them, etc. I've heard that cards will generally only evolve once, to go to one star higher than their base form, so like Blade 5 * -> 6 *. But then there are extreme evolutions? Is that like a 5 * -> 6 * -> 7 *? And then if a card starts at 6 * they'll eventually hit 8 * with extreme evolution?  Edit: I've know found there's a difference between special training (adding yellow stars) and evolving (red stars). Kind of confused here :S  And other than levelling up units through training, giving them things like Beelzebub/Swirlies to upgrade stats and evolutions, what are other ways to power up units? I've heard of things like ""clover""?"
soccerspirits,3d21ok,khrawn,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:03:04 2015 UTC,"Okay so, there are 5 ways of increasing the stats of your players.  Leveling up:  The first and most logical way is leveling up the players. A players max lvl is their number of stars times 10. So a 3 star player will only be able to reach lvl 30 while a 5 star player will reach lvl 50. So how does one increase stars?  Special Training:  By doing special training on a unit it's star lvl will increase by 1, adding another 10 potential lvls to the unit. Notice that currently, for a 2 star to become a 3 star you need the 2 star to be max lvl'd and another 2x lvl 20 2 star players, and when the ""main"" 2 star becomes a 3 star it's lvl will be reset to lvl 1. For a 3 star you need 3x 3 stars + the one you wanted to Special train, a 4 star requires 4x 4 stars and a 5 star requires 5x 5 stars. 6 stars is the current maximum and so 6 stars can't be special trained. Notice that every single card has to be max lvl currently, but in the future there will be a patch that changes this so only the card you want to Special train has to be max lvl while the other cards just has to have the corresponding stars. Notice that a natural 3 star will have higher stats than a special trained 2 star, and a natural 4 star will have higher stats than a special trained 3 star and so on, but because of skills some units are worth to special train ti'll they are 6 stars even if at start they are only 4 or 3 star.  Evolution:  Evolving players is another way to increase their stats. There are currently 3 tiers of evolution: Non-evolved, Evolved and Extreme Evolved.   A non-evolved player will have yellow stars. An evolved player will have red stars. An extreme evolved player will have pinkish shining stars. Notice that currently only Noa and Sam are ""special"" characters and so these are the only ones below 5 stars that have any EE, no other 2, 3 or 4 stars currently has any EE form. Not all 5 stars has one. Every Season 1 legendary has an EE but not the Season 2 Legendaries. There are plans in the future to give some 4 stars EE forms though.  When you evolve a player it will get a boost to it's active ability and one of it's 3 passives will get anything from a mioner boost to a major one. When you EE a player it's active will again get a boost and one of it's skills will get a major boost to a change in skill. For example one of Nerua's skills gives 20% defense and hp boost to her row. But if you EE her that skill changes to give 20% defense and hp boost to all thunder players in your team. So if you are using her off colour then EE'ing her makes her useless while if you are in a mono-thunder team her EE makes her act like an Ace skill. Other units like such as Avnore goes from decreasing enemy action speed and pass effect to also decreasing their reflexes.  Superb training:  Superb training is when you feed a copy of the same card to the card. So if you feed Eden to another Eden than Eden will receive a bonus of 10% stat increase + 1 skill point. Another way to do this is with littre's. It is only recommended to use 5 star littre's on 5 star or 6 star natural players. Since littre's are very hard to get. You can give a player 5 superb trainings before it is maxed. This will also transfer the clovers of the feeded player to the fed player. Clovers are basicly ""luck points"" and the more clovers you have on your team the higher chance for better drop, although the amount on clovers on your ace is worth more than clovers on the other players, but having a few 2* or 3* with many clovers helps a lot still though, since they are easy to get high clover lvl's on. max clovers are 99. Notice clovers doesn't do anything for anything else but drops.  + stats:  Each players stats can be increased by 30, giving a total of 120 more stat points. The ""best"" way to go about this is giving 4x 5 star beelzebubs to 1 player in order to get +28 on all 4 stats and then feed swirlies for the last +2 to the stats. There are many ways though. Swirlies gives +1, +2 or +3 to 1 stat depending on luck, beelzebubs gives +5 to 1 stat when 3 star form and in 5 star form the give +7 to all 4 stats totalling +28. Lastly there are Black hole swirlies which you can get thursday and friday from a weekly dungeon and scout, these are used to EE players though so i'd use them after you have all the EE's you need. They increase 1 stat by +4.    I hope this covered most of the basics. Anyway, it's possible for a 2 star to equal that of a 3 or even 4 star just by superbing it, but usually you want to use units for their skills and not their stats."

You can make do with a 4* striker until you scout one with GP.  So I say, stick with that account because it has a good GK for PvE and Yuri is very good in all teams."
soccerspirits,3d21ok,lastra1,0,Mon Jul 13 15:17:24 2015 UTC,"Both are very good players, but it's the striker that will be scoring most goals. Starting with a striker means that you will breeze yourself in early levels without much need to think about formation - as long as you pass to your uber striker, you win.  EDIT. I also vote for stay since my favourite player is now Isillia and before her it was Yuri xD"
soccerspirits,3d21ok,modxy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:14:58 2015 UTC,"PVP team: http://imgur.com/9CgHHSk,vP0Tt2J#0 PVE team: http://imgur.com/9CgHHSk,vP0Tt2J#1  I'm thinking on subbing Silla,Cynthia and maybe Veronica. I'm thinking about replacing Nari with Silla and Kevin with Cynthia for PVP. Any recommendations on who else I can sub out for PVE and PVE? Or is it a bad idea?  Thanks!  Also, just scouted Jeunese, thinking about picking him up for those super bosses cause he can cheese them. Is he really that good at cheesing?"
soccerspirits,3d21ok,lastra1,0,Mon Jul 13 14:53:59 2015 UTC,"As much as I love my Silla, Nari is much better passer, her crit rate also helps to combat anti-crits in PvP while Bea has her own penetration power. You may be off switching Yuri, since Silla is more of a totem than passer. Also Yuri will penetrate in auto and can't really steal. In PvP it may not be so visible, but PvE steals sometimes are godsend.  If your Hilde has MetaWill/EoG, you may want to keep Kevin, otherwise have Cynthia combo with Lia for evil speed modifiers, also because Cynthia is likely to have more stats that a boosted Kevin.  Get a Sammy, even if you won't use her as PvP CM ballholder, you will like her heals in PvE since Kei doesn't have any.  Jenuese was key to defeat last super boss, but you could have borrowed one from a friend. I heard some people praised him for high colo, but no one ever recorded him on high colo vid. If you have spare GP, you can give him a try."
soccerspirits,3d21ok,modxy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:25:25 2015 UTC,"So i should go with Bea/Nari/Silla in the front? Should I skip the active and focus on the passives since I'm using her as a totem?  My Hilde does have MetaWill, but for some reason, the opponent's line still moves before my line does with Kevin. So I was wondering if Cynthia would work better.  I do have Sammy EE, but I'm not sure where to but her, and who to sub out.   Yea, I was bummed since I couldnt beat the last super boss and I passed on Jeunese the day before she came out.   Also who would you recommend that I focus on Superbing at stat increase? My Nari is at 3 Superb now and I dont feel like give her more superbs will help. I'll be feeding her Beezels now that I'm going to keep her in the line. Mikael and Lia has 1, Kevin/Cynthia has 2 and Hilde has none.   Thanks!"
soccerspirits,3d21ok,lastra1,0,Mon Jul 13 16:01:56 2015 UTC,"Yuri is definitely not a bad totem, but her problem is that she can't do anything except being a totem, while Silla can steal/counter, can generate spirit, can recover line action bar on top of being a totem, but it's Yuri who will boost you damage more, so I won't tell to use one over another because each of them has different use. But if you use Silla then bossing her passives over active is a good choice, because you will most likely won't need active in auto-PvP to save spirit for Nari pass, while you can always use it in manual for second strong and immediate shot.  I'll also add that you can use Yuri instead of Mikael. Her CA res is more helpful when you defenders don't have much reflex and you don't exactly need a penetrator. Also she can wield more tanky stones than Mikael.  MetaWill/Kevin combo with Hilde shows it's true worth after first attack. Just watch this vid dubbed HildeGod.  For PvE, you won't need both Hilde and Lia, one is often enough with Hilde's advantage of being able to move the ball to the next line more than once per 15 min. Leave one, switch the other for Sammy.  For superbing, if you won't want Nari (I'd still give Nari first priority) then second is Hilde, with all her skills she will have both strength and utility to play in combo with MetaWill. If you think about it again, she may not need much crit rate due to MetaWill, but she does need stat boost with superbs. I also haven't heard about Duke, if he's not full, you may give him some boost too. I you use Yuri front, than she's also a good choice, but not necessarily if she's in def."
soccerspirits,3d21ok,modxy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:24:58 2015 UTC,"Oh wow I forgot about Duke lol. Yea He's fully superbed and +119 stats. Didnt feel like using a swirly to get that 1 last point...   Ah that video, that's the one that inspired me to try our Hilde when I got my MetaWill. OK so for PVP I'm thinking subbing Silla for Yuri and Cynthia for Mikael and for PVE, I'll sub Silla for Yuri and Sammy for Lia. I'll finish superb Nari and then move on to Hilde.  Thanks for the tips!"

I usually see answer like this ""...Dark HP, Dark Dmg reduction, Green AS...""  Does the elemental of the stones matter?  Such as if the player is Dark, the dark slots will give more bonus than the non-dark slots?   So for Zibroi, a 10% HP dark stone will give more bonus than a 10% Green stone something like that?"
soccerspirits,3d21ok,kaldyra,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:16:33 2015 UTC,"Yes those I can understand.  However, for example Zibroi, he has 2 dark and 1 green stone slot, so in this case, if i have a green 10% HP stone and another dark 10% HP stone, it doesn't really matter which one stone use (yes must put dark stone in dark slot) - either one I will get 10% HP for my Zibroi, correct?"
soccerspirits,3d21ok,SoccerHeli,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:34:00 2015 UTC,"Stones come in Common and Rare. You want to use Rare's where possible because they provide a second stat in addition to the bonus stats. Also a player cannot use stones if they don't have the correct color slot. For example, an ardor slot can only equip ardor stones. If you special train you get a rainbow slot where you can equip any non-unique  stone."
soccerspirits,3d21ok,Moreni-to,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:04:11 2015 UTC,No but you can't put a green stone on a dark spot (thx captain obvious). So you need to optimise the stats you are going to earn with each stones :)

soccerspirits,3d21ok,celestialrq,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:25:42 2015 UTC,"I thought uniques were unique cause you can only equip one of them, as opposed to all other stones, where you can equip as many rares/commons as you can."

soccerspirits,3d0k7j,Alkyde,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:36:47 2015 UTC,Android Republic is a known forum where people shares mod/hacks for android games. Soccer Spirits in particular has a God mode hack that's been around for awhile that basically lets you auto win every matches (https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=46&v=Vz04IQb2iTM). This is why you occasionally see top 50 in colo with very low score. The problem is no one bother reporting it to the devs so they cant be bothered to fix it. The only way they can fix the hack is to make damage calculation server side.
soccerspirits,3d0k7j,xacex94,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:16:52 2015 UTC,"I see you point, but if every damage calculation is made server-side then there must be a constant client-server conection even while the match. For not so good internet connections, that would a pain in the ass, since for every connection lag it would exit the match and return to the game start screen. That is, if they don't implement a connection retry instead of exiting all the damn game only because a connection error (i've always found it an amazingly lazy and silly method of reconnect, and would be nice to rework a little about it)."
soccerspirits,3d0k7j,Alkyde,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:24:43 2015 UTC,"Well if you lost connection in the middle of the match you'll get ""connection lost"" anyway and the game kicks you out to the title screen so. But connection retry is a good idea, not sure why they don't implement it."
soccerspirits,3d0k7j,xacex94,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:17:27 2015 UTC,"You actually won't get connection lost if you lose connection in the middle of the match, only if you actually have issues when it's finishing. What im saying is, you might get connection issues during the match, but as long as you have connection when finishing its ok, since matches are done fully client-sided.  Constantly syncronising with the server during a match is not worth, since every action would need a server connection, plus a latency, and matches would be stressfull and much more slow."

If you don't want to lvl up too quickly they're a great way to get gold while not lvling up, but to get materials, really... don't do it.  Bigball talked about how they plan to introduce a ""purchase match"" where you can get those materials reliably like with the 6 star penguins.  If you want them now for EE, your best choice is to stick with very hard and spam the living hell out of it and also scout any and every swirly of that color you see in scouts, that's how I got them."
soccerspirits,3cz2rz,fokxe,2,Sun Jul 12 02:14:35 2015 UTC,"So, you might not be able to use what i'm writing since i'm ""late"" but i don't really think you got all the questions answered so i'm just gonna write a bit, even though it might be useless and i might repeat a bit of what the others have already written, so, disclaimer aside:  1:  There is no difference in content both servers has the exact same units/matches available.  I don't know about people but on the korean server people are more ""mature"" meaning there are a lot more people with full ""perfect"" teams and such, but really, early lvl's and such should still be the same but i'd still suggest going for Global simply because it's english.  2:  There are a lot of tactic involved in creating teams, but most teams are cookie cutter, meaning, striker + assist + totem front, attacker + ballholder + totem/whatever mid and hp totem+defensive totem + attacker/defender/longpass + goalkeeper bottom.  There is an auto button and thank god am i thankful for it. Try farming the same dungeon in puzzle and dragon just doing 6+ combos for the sake of it because after 30 times of doing the same motion to hit a 3 combo to oneshot each floor you just get bored. Anyway, i like the auto button, but i still have to play for new matches in story mode and also in colloseum and arena.   Also, to expand on matches there are 4 ""main types"". first is story mode, story mode is basicly, story, there are 3 tiers, normal, challenge and hell. You have to beat a ""tournament"" and then you can afk each match in that ""tournament"" so you have to beat story mode before you can afk it. In Space Time Continuum there are a lot of different matches, including pinguins for EXP, weekday for evolving materials and others. These you can auto and i like it. Next is colloseum, in here there are 50 fixed matches, each time you beat a match you can challenge the next. So you beat floor 1, then you beat floor 2, 3, 4. Now you can't get any higher, because floor 5 is too hard for you, so you are ""stuck, but you can reset it once a day to clear each floor more for GP. Last is the ""Pvp"" mode. In here there are 2 choices, one is arena and the other is tournament. In tournament you fight for ranking, higher ranking gives better rewards when tourney is over. In arena you get more GP pr. match won max is 4 though, but this is the best source to grind GP so you want to be able to keep beating your enemies here. They are based on your own rank and up to 6 ranks below you, so you don't want to overlevel so that the enemies here are too strong for you, except if you don't want to do this.  The thing is, in tournament the games are all on auto to make it fair i guess, since the ai is crap, but in arena you can play yourself which i suggest since it fucking sucks loosing a winning streak because bad AI.  3:  I don't know about ressource list but there are ALOT and i mean ALOT of people who run the same ""core team"" using Hiro for Light/thunder or Metatron for Dark/Light teams. What you notice is that everyone, and i mean everyone and their mother uses either Jin or Kei as their goal keeper. Hybrid teams are very strong though as you get the best of both worlds. Another strong dual ace is Sammy which enables light/ardor. Also Silla is very popular and arguably the strongest ace in the game.  So basicly if you are just starting out i highly suggest you reroll untill you get a hybrid ace enabler since it doesn't matter which one you get, anything that enable hybrid teams is very strong.  4:  This game is kind of very P2W and yet not. A single Legendary cost 900 dollars to get, if you want to be sure to get it, but you can pick yourself exactly the legendary you want. You get a lot of free crystals at start and i suggest you save them for now. Spend a few crystals on penguin matches so that you can max lvl your striker, goal keeper and someone in the middle to get the ball up to your striker, but save crystals, and wait with drawing untill you got your legend at rank 30 IMHO. Depending on the legendary you pull, for example if you pull Leventor or William you will want to build your team around those.  Anyway, i hope that some of the information i gave was useful, and if you have any questions about teambuilding or anything else just ask here or in the daliy thread!"
soccerspirits,3cz2rz,khrawn,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:58:34 2015 UTC,"1.Haven't played on the korean server,but you can play both freely.Both are the same version too,ot like in other gaes where one version is ahead of the other.  2.Dunno much about the club thing as it has it has not been implemented yet,but there is an auto button in this game,but that's for farming purposes and galaxy league when you can't control your units. Otherwise there's plenty of game play like in the Colosseum of death and arena matches. It is more tactical,but at the same time can devolve do a certain set of units as being op, so to speak.    I'm from Brave frontier and this game does have a lot you can do up until the very very late game. It's a similar system of gatcha and evolving stuff,but is less stingy and you can get to end game without buying crystals....in fact it's not cost effecient to buy them.   4.It's actually free to play and you can with patience get everything you ever wanted, it's just the whale over there will get there 10 times faster. Out of all the games I've played, this is by far one of the most generous yet brutal games out there. It really puts your patience to the test,but the good news is re-rolling on IOS and android is ez as pie  good luck, have fun and use the sticky at the top of the reddit. You'll be told that eventually. I quit Brave frontier at around 150 because when I stopped spending, I stopped getting new toys."
soccerspirits,3cz2rz,Fluffyknowsyou,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:22:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. ""Out of all the games I've played, this is by far one of the most generous yet brutal games out there. It really puts your patience to the test"" - what do you mean by the game being brutal?    And on the topic of BF comparisons, how would you compare the unit bases? Does BF have a significantly larger collection of units to collect? How about in terms of actually meta units? And I'm sure that BF has more players, but is it a significant amount? My biggest gripe with BF, as I outlined before, is the fact that gameplay is just tap tap tap, BB/SBB when ready, no matter if you're questing or doing trials. There's very little decision making in the game after team building, and that's simply making sure you have a crit buffer, a spark buffer, a mitigator and done."
soccerspirits,3cz2rz,Fluffyknowsyou,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:40:25 2015 UTC,"On the topic of being brutal, it hooks you in with a free 10+1 draw, 5 premium tickets, a 2nd and 14th day 5 star, a 5* when you hit 15, a legend at 30,but after that getting good cards gets extremely hard. Despite the bad rates global brave frontier had, some of the rates for this game are abysmal outside of the assured 5* draws. When I say brutal, I mean you'll eventually hit a brick wall that depending on your investment into the game will keep you from having a full team. On my first account I had 4 strikers, which suffice to say is like having 4 crit buffers on brave frontier. As I said it's very generous but you hit a brick wall because while there are special events, you generally farm small amounts of glory points(summoning points) and playing your hand vs rngeezus. It's brutal in that you can get 5 free good cards good cards,but they are all low on the tier or of the same class.  There are actually like 10 broken,but very very rare cards and around 30 great units, 50 meh units and a ton of low level cards which are hidden gems. Half my team consists of four stars and I've got a 2 star that competes with 5 stars in its niche. There's plenty of variety if you don't have a full team of meta units, which...will take you a long time to complete. Much longer than Brave frontier. But it's a game that rewards the patient as everything is attainable by farming up for what you want.  Well in terms of teambuilding there are stones which act as enhancers, that make or break units. You have to take healing into account because in the arena it's negligible. You ave to take Ai into account and literally how you spend your skill points, determines if a character will use an op power on its own. The game isn't going to be a replacement for a game like dota or starcraft,but it's got enough depth to make entire discussions about who is the best and who is just serviceable..  which should speak volumes about its diversity."
soccerspirits,3cz2rz,Fluffyknowsyou,2,Sun Jul 12 02:58:16 2015 UTC,"Hmm, diversity sounds good at least! I take it that re-rolls are recommended if you don't get very good cards in the first draws?"
soccerspirits,3cz2rz,Kelven486,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:45:18 2015 UTC,"It depends. At the very least I would not start an account worth keeping without at least one good 5 star, like ravian, lucid, Kirin, kei. You just need one good game breaker to give yourself a good start.   Lol yes diversity, there are players like ustiel and butch who are considered bad and produce no good results, but four stars and 3's who can hold their own until you get that token 5 star.   Good luck dude, just focus on getting one good 5 star. The new player bonuses make it worth rerolling, but don't go crazy like me"
soccerspirits,3cz2rz,ricki692,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:37:39 2015 UTC,"I never bothered rerolling. Sure, getting a really good 5* to start gives you a boost, but don't feel you NEED to reroll in this game. As the other poster said, a 5* like Ustiel may be considered crap, but that's crap for 5* standards. Sure, she definitely won't be on your end-game team, or even your mid-game team, but by then who knows how your team would develop.   You reroll and may get a good 5* like Lucid, and by mid-game your draws and luck with scout may take you down a different element altogether, and you bench that Lucid anyways.  BUT, that's just my opinion."

soccerspirits,3cz2rz,celestialrq,0,Sun Jul 12 03:39:23 2015 UTC,"The korean server is more 'advanced' with their players so you'd be going up against an old community where players have strong well developed teams, go on the global server since more english people are there. There is an auto system if you wish, it helps because farming is tedious and you can multitask at the same time. End game PVP is on auto mode due to the nature of the game. Clan wars, let alone clans have yet to be implemented, it should be soon. Maybe if you look on the right side of the side bar? And theres loads of guides here and a tier list too: http://soccerspiritsforum.com/forums/guides-and-tips.11/ I won't be doing the scrolling for you. Yes this game is good at a F2P, ive been playing for roughly 3 months now and enjoying every single bit of it, havent spent a cent too.   The only problem about being F2P is that it takes time to obviously get the cards you want, unless you spend money/crystals. So if you wish to get your ""dream team"" in a single attempt, that is, I call an attempt like the first 6 months of gameplay, without spending money, you'd be kidding yourself.  Like you gotta make do with the cards you're given, and I've got lots of powerful cards, its just that RNG kind of leads you towards like an element that usually isn't your first preference, but I've dealt with it and my Ardor/WW team is doing me great and winning lots of times, even though I tried going WW/Thunder at the start.  If you wish to make your dream team, you would re-roll early, or make it as a second team AFTER your first initial complete team."

soccerspirits,3cz2rz,prysmae,0,Sun Jul 12 02:43:02 2015 UTC,"Well in regards to Meta vs non-Meta units, it depends on your team, of course there're units that you can use in any team (most Legends) however a well-thought team can beat a haphazard team of individually powerful players.  Which units are Meta ? essentially any unit that's 5-star base or more (legends), and some of the 4-star units are useable, with the exception of a couple of 5-star players, some of the players however are gimmiky or only show their true power when you have a team built around them, otherwise it's more about roles than actual players.  The players with the most impact on your performance would be your Striker and your Goalkeeper, since the first is the one who wins you the game, and the other is the one that keeps you from losing, get a decent player for those 2 slots and you can go far.  Also, the game is very generous to free players, specially those starting out, you get a free random 5-star player at level 15, a free Legend player at 30, and 2 free 5-star players from log-in rewards on Days 2 and 14, if you do the reroll trick to start with a 5-star from your 17!!! starting draws (yes you draw 17 times, not including the tutorial draw which is guaranteed 4-star), that's 5 players who are useful and can carry you pretty far in the game, you can also use that same reroll trick to refer yourself 5 times for one more 5-star player, which essentially means that in 2 weeks time you get over half of your team done (not as in final team, but a working team nonetheless).  As for crystals, you want to do 2-3 draws early to expand your options (by draws I mean the 10+1 draws, rather than the single ones), after that, you're better off spending your Crystals on other things (scout slots, Lodgings, Penguin Matches, Battle Ball refreshes, ST refreshes for boss matches), if you're in doubt about what to do with your crystals, save them."

soccerspirits,3cy9ez,the-rice-is-real,3,Sat Jul 11 21:33:28 2015 UTC,"I would keep it and again I disagree with the ""you need a good striker first"" mentality that people have. Now that elemental tabs are gone it's pretty much impossible to build a good mono/hybrid team without getting really lucky or advancing far into the game, and even then you might not have a choice of what colors you end up with. I think a heavy investment into a striker commits you down a path that you may or may not take. I think that it's much better to prioritize based on the following rather than focusing on GK/Striker when rerolling:   Any legendary (especially Baltheon, Bell, Jin, or Metatron) Any ""must have"" players who are good in rainbow (Silla, Kiki, Nerua, Mikael even though I personally hate him, etc.) Any decent striker/GK that you have a strong personal preference for (e.g. the guy who wanted Isillia, the guy who is trying now to get Lucian)   If you have the patience to reroll for legendary that's obviously the best way to go but if you don't (2) and (3) are not bad either. You don't need a 5* striker right off the bat since you will almost certainly scout someone you like later, but you do need to see where the chips fall in terms of the rest of the team to see what's the best striker to get."

soccerspirits,3cy9ez,Soziele,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:11:27 2015 UTC,You're welcome!
soccerspirits,3cy9ez,Propagation931,0,Sun Jul 12 06:32:37 2015 UTC,The top 3 things you look for when rerolling are   1) Any Legendary  2) 5 star striker that isn't Vann or Griffith  3) 5 star goalie that isn't Robin or Raklet  Since you have Beth definitely keep that account and take it to Rank 30 to see who else you get!
soccerspirits,3cy9ez,Soziele,2,Sun Jul 12 00:31:16 2015 UTC,3.) Raklet has a confirmed EE coming so its Robin and Lucian
soccerspirits,3cy9ez,Propagation931,2,Sun Jul 12 00:37:44 2015 UTC,"Luka, Hercules, Lynbell, and Virgil are also getting EE's soon.  I still wouldn't recommend them right now.  Plus especially for Raklet her EE needs to bring her a serious boost to make her a competitive goalie.  It could happen, but you shouldn't be building a team expecting it will.  With all of the other 5* players you could draw for a new account you can do better than something that might become good."
soccerspirits,3cy9ez,Soziele,2,Sun Jul 12 01:16:58 2015 UTC,Lynbell technically doesnt. Then the answer is just look for Kei
soccerspirits,3cy9ez,zarwow,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:27:41 2015 UTC,"Well we've seen Lynbell's EE art, so she's getting one eventually.  Whether that is in our lifetimes is another problem"
soccerspirits,3cy9ez,Propagation931,2,Sun Jul 12 04:09:48 2015 UTC,"What are you talking about? Lucian is a really good GK cause of his action bar and hp heal and he even has a block while Raklet has neither, just cause he doesn't have an EE doesn't mean he's shit."
soccerspirits,3cy9ez,zarwow,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:24:43 2015 UTC,He suffers from being bad in pvp. At least Raklet might b good. Might as well just say Jin or Kei. Zib is a toss up. But Zib flat out beats Lucian
soccerspirits,3cy9ez,Propagation931,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:27:16 2015 UTC,"Lucian isn't bad in PvP, he has a ton of CR resist + a block. Zibroi is only useful for PvE, Lucian can be used in both PvE and PvP"
soccerspirits,3cy9ez,zarwow,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:36:17 2015 UTC,But he is not the best in both he is sorta middleground.  He is a worse Kei in pvp nd a worse zib in pve.
soccerspirits,3cy9ez,Propagation931,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:45:43 2015 UTC,Still really good and much better than Raklet.
soccerspirits,3cy9ez,Soziele,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:56:47 2015 UTC,"Also not all EE strikers are good.  Bora, Vitos, Uriel, Latios are all kind of subpar compared to their same element counterparts"
soccerspirits,3cy9ez,Propagation931,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:49:50 2015 UTC,"Vitos isn't subpar he's just a pain to build.  Once he is fully built he's really strong, it's just a long road to get him there.  Latios has the same problem.  For Bora and Uriel you're right, but I don't like telling people they can't use them.  It's harder than Sharr or Hiro, but if they want to do it I prefer to just tell them what they need to make it work, not that it is a bad choice."
soccerspirits,3cy9ez,Cpokemon12,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:09:22 2015 UTC,Well Vitos ok but compared to Ravian and Lucid....

soccerspirits,3cy9ez,Cpokemon12,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:18:07 2015 UTC,True but better than Lucid isnt much of an accomplishment. Ravian is near god tier for pvp and Lucid is near god tier for pve. Vitos is kinda decent for Pve and if light wasnt so dominant vitos would be ok for pvp. Sadly a lot of GKs are Kei so he is kinda meh too
soccerspirits,3cvkuq,littlejoey171,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:29:00 2015 UTC,"Hi, a question for you since you do a lot of top level PvP:  How often do you see Hiro strikers/aces from top players?  What's the best setup (one that gives you or one that you know gives others a lot of trouble) you see for him?"
soccerspirits,3cvkuq,Zabick,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:33:49 2015 UTC,"Most common strikers for high level are Hiro, Beatrice, Ravian and Sharr.  Usually people use Metatron as ACE instead of Hiro if they run both.    Hiro/Silla/Baltheon  Beth/Metatron/Duke  For backline there are a lot of good combos, depending on which uniques you have. But Kiki, Bell, Nerua, Jin, Mikael, Anael, Kei, Milky Way are all strong options.  Seniel, Dreamer77, Hurtera, Wussa, & Sobbit are all top teams that currently run Hiro as striker.  Check out some of the vids with them and you can see their formations."

soccerspirits,3cujis,nlyubimov,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:47:49 2015 UTC,Nice team. If you want to keep Silla I would put in Alkyde instead of Veronica.  Another way is to make 4 man front. In that case I would probably put Bell in front instead of Silla. Silla in mid so that she can pass to Duke for better penetration. In that case Ravian or Alkyde would probably move to support.  Also I would Nerua in mid and Mikael on RB.

It's the reason I can't bring hild back, because beatrice can't do the job by herself.  My team is also pretty much leveled except for the 4 stars like juno, who are level 35.

As for littres save up the 3* and evolve them into a 5* when you have enough of them, then fully superb your striker first and your keeper second.

soccerspirits,3cujis,Articfreezer,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:43:32 2015 UTC,I'd actually say Juno since you already have a long pass in Morgana. But Clarissa's buffs are quite dang good too so she and Morgana are interchangeable

I've already used up all my stored stamina and spent around 100 crystals and have 3 alkydes (soon to be 4 as I'm about to buy my second copy with a few more season points) so if I'm lucky I could still get the remaining drops to fully superb her.  My question is even if I don't get to fully superb her is it worth it to spend that many crystals?"

Here's my team: http://imgur.com/ZqI4DOA  Thank you!"
soccerspirits,3cujis,vrainsworth,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:30:01 2015 UTC,"the chances are very abysmal, and you've got a really good team going on, so personally I wouldn't take the risk (can spend crystal on penguin matches or open scout slot if you haven't). there's a good goalkeeper rival match going on (Leonard) which can be your placeholder for a very long time until you scout a proper one."
soccerspirits,3cujis,ExilusNotus,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:01:44 2015 UTC,I just got one Leonard. (Finally) but I've been trying for more copies to superb with without any luck.  Is he really that good? My current black mash is really effective since he has around 380hp.  Also I already unlocked all the scout slots.  Currently pulled a Nerua but I only have around 600gp.  I am so doomed.
soccerspirits,3cujis,Anal_Llama,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:04:57 2015 UTC,Full superbed Leonard is the best you will have until you EE a goalkeeper and superb them twice.

soccerspirits,3cujis,vrainsworth,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:17:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah he has good crit resist and ok damage reduction; later on he's vulnerable to OHKO due to lack of block, but those will usually OHKO Black Mash too since he has low HP.

Try to find a front line passer.

soccerspirits,3ct4ax,Heisou,4,Fri Jul 10 15:41:52 2015 UTC,"Welcome to Soccer Spirits!  Here's a short guide to ensuring that you get off to a balanced start:   Don't use the 2x exp boosters. Use some crystals to buy penguin matches and max level your 5* player cards (need level 8 for Colosseum). Level to 10 and unlock pvp. Do arena (not ranked) pvp as much and frequently as possible (you should be easily winning 100%). You want to stay on the winning streak as long as possible. Use GP only for 5-6 star units, littres and beelzebubs. Nothing else. I would hesitate scouting any players until after rank 30 (when you see your legendary since it will generally decide your team. For e.g. Metatron enables dark/light hybrid teams). Get rank 30, hope for the legendary you want. If not, it isn't the end of the world but it's up to you if you want to continue with the account. Or remake for another shot at a different legendary (you lose everything). Don't sell or use 4-6* player cards as training fodder. Keep them for the future (you will need them for special training aka. ST). You may sell 3* cards if you wish for GP. Hold onto your littres and beelzebubs (combine 5x littres or 5x beelzebubs). Save them until you are 100% sure on keeping the players you want to spend them on.   Important note: You want to be ranking up as slowly as possible, to maximise your gains in PVP. The faster you climb, the earlier you hit strong teams = you may lose PVP win streaks resulting in loss of GP.   All the best."
soccerspirits,3ct4ax,prysmae,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:28:08 2015 UTC,"Well since I started with the 2x exp and I unknowingly used it, should I just refrain from playing? I already hit rank 16.."
soccerspirits,3ct4ax,happyft,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:47:50 2015 UTC,"I think it's okay to rank up as fast as you can to rank 30 because cost is an issue for the early game and it's kind of hard to farm GP as a new player as well -- and getting the legendary asap is your priority. However, after rank 30 I'd say be conscious of your exp intake. it's bad if you're like rank 50 and you're still fielding 3star players and have only 3k team ability.  Arena will be your main source of GP income for a while until you can hit colo floor 20-30. That being said, you'll probably be spending up to rank 50-55 just farming story mode + free mode for those delicious crystals to draw with. Yeah draw rates suck ass, but they're your main source of players until you have a good enough team to do colo with."
soccerspirits,3ct4ax,prysmae,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:22:42 2015 UTC,"Solid advice, thanks a lot. (:"
soccerspirits,3ct4ax,happyft,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:30:42 2015 UTC,"I beg to differ. The early stages of the game are by far the easiest way to make gp. Rank 1-30 you can net around 200 or more wins in arena. That's around 700 gp. Also, you've used your 7 day exp boost, meaning you'll hit rank 30 in 1-2 days with efficient play time. Leaving you with at most, 5 days left on the exp boost. If you continue playing with the boost on, you'll rank far beyond where you should ideally be at.   I suggest you list your 5 and 6 star player card here now. If they're not good. Remake the account and don't use the exp boost. You'll regret it if you continue, in my opinion.   However, if you would rather continue, that's fine too."
soccerspirits,3ct4ax,prysmae,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:50:29 2015 UTC,"I have a couple 5's from the giveaway stuff.   Lynia, Lia, Lucius and Yuri"
soccerspirits,3ct4ax,prysmae,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:55:36 2015 UTC,"Yuri = top tier, you see her in almost every team (or used to, at least)  Lucius and Lia both great for ardor teams.  Lynia is not worth investing into, but any 5star is usable until like rank 60 or so.  Overall I'd say you have a better than average starting team, but it really really depends on your legendary. If you end up getting Jin, Baltheon, or Metatron, or heck even Beth, I'd keep it. Bell is great too, but not top 3."

soccerspirits,3ct4ax,prysmae,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:55:19 2015 UTC,"Look, I may have come on strongly about the whole don't level quick thing, it's probably only a difference of 1 extra player scout. So if you enjoy the game and don't really care about pvp; just keep playing. If you're needing to wait just because you don't want to level up quickly, it's not too late to re-roll/remake a new account. I mean, what's the point of playing a game if you have to wait just because you don't want to level?  In fact, if you really want a good start, you could keep re-rolling whilst you're playing your current account, until you land a good start (draw 5* players straight after tutorial). But that's not really fun, and it'll burn you out."

soccerspirits,3ct4ax,prysmae,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:22:47 2015 UTC,"200 wins, that's a whole week of extra playing assuming he doesn't miss a single streak. And 700GP is pretty nice amount, but it's not all that much in the long run. You can get 300-400 per day pretty easily once you hit rank 65 or so.  But I hear ya. I guess cuz I never had any trouble with arena I never had to worry about exp/rank issues."
soccerspirits,3ct4ax,Arsenothelus,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:16:18 2015 UTC,"Are you P2W? 300-400 GP is very far reached for someone who is F2P unless they have the luck of gods and rolled an amazing team that can easily clear 30+ stages of colosseum, @ 16 hours of play per day, that's 8 x 16 GP (144) from arena (assuming no streak break). Stamina -> GP is RNG, but lets say you were quite lucky and get 12 3* from grinding story (144). Add that to the daily 12gp. It's difficult to hit 300, let alone 400. Not to mention, if he/she is using the 2x booster, the team won't have the extra 1 or 2 player scouts from the early stages of GP gain, resulting in a weaker team.  Note: This is also assuming the person plays with maximum efficiency. No downtime on any energy bars.  With that being said, if you want to see the legendary, by all means rush to 30; otherwise, there's no reason to."
soccerspirits,3ct4ax,Best_Lumber_JackEUW,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:34:37 2015 UTC,"Haven't spent a cent.  Warning, long post with math below:  Daily achievement 4x colo = 12GP Daily achievement 3-6star player card = 12GP Colosseum: 33 matches a day = 40GP (20 floors) + 60GP (21-30 floors) + 51GP (3 champions, assuming 10% appearance rate) = 151GP Arena = 131GP (36 matches x 4GP - 13GP to account for 1 broken streak)  That's 306GP right there.  You get an extra ~25GP/day on average from colosseum when you consider the fact that you can actually run it 8 times a week if you're smart about how you rollover your Sunday reset. You get 6GP/day on average from the free crystal draw you get every 3 days. ~3GP/day on average from the 3-4star boxes from login reward. ~4GP/day on average from the GP login rewards. You get 12GP from doing 17 story matches assuming 40% luck proc rate.  That's an extra 50GP to reach 356GP/day. None of these calculations are stretches, they're all regular averages.  You can get an extra 50GP/day thru story mode farming, boss match farming, friendship draws, or getting lucky with champion matches. I'd say friendship draws is the easiest to get that extra GP to hit 400 in a day.  Disclaimer: by no means am I recommending anyone to play like this every day! So yeah, I should take back my earlier statement of ""pretty easily"". I'm totally addicted to this game so I'm able to do this 3 days of the week, but yeah I can't do it every day of the week lol."
soccerspirits,3ct4ax,Euphoniax,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:19:53 2015 UTC,"Look at this from a new players' perspective. A new account, getting anywhere near that amount of GP in Colosseum is highly unlikely. Yes, if you had a strong team you can net that amount of GP and slay champions. However, getting the strong team is the real issue. Without GP, you can't get strong players to net in more GP (by clearing higher level Colosseums and securing pvp wins).   All I am trying to say is - Unless you're desperate and need to see your rank 30 legendary, there is no reason to use the 2x exp and rank quickly. Especially when hitting rank 30 is easily achievable within a week of regular play. You want the GP early to GET to the stage you're talking about."

soccerspirits,3crfao,Anal_Llama,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:06:24 2015 UTC,Except a GK. Also this all happened recently. WW has had all of those for ages. Thunder only recently starting with Jurys release got all that.
soccerspirits,3crfao,Anal_Llama,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:25:38 2015 UTC,Jury came out more then 6 months ago though. So I don't get how that's recent.
soccerspirits,3crfao,Raikaru,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:36:19 2015 UTC,"Well... it wasn't Jury's release alone. I'm saying the era of buffing thunder slowly began with Jury. She was the first 5-star mono thunder ace that gave HP/ATk that wasn't Butcher (shudder).   Then we got Hildegard and Nerua/Cynthia most recently. Bell change doesn't hurt either.  And I guess recent depends on how long you've been playing. WW has been the top mono team since the beginning since Jin was THE ONLY 7* goalkeeper for a loooong time. Felt like ages. Everyone was using Fusero. Kei wasn't even touched except by light users. WW could also fill a lot of spots including Beatrice being the best striker at the time (well obtainable, Godventor was still top until pen nerf).   All in all the game has/is always changing. It's just some colors straggled behind to get where they are."
soccerspirits,3crfao,Anal_Llama,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:03:39 2015 UTC,WW is OP and no one care rofl
soccerspirits,3crfao,erehinater,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:36:48 2015 UTC,I think all mono teams have the potential to be very strong. It's just getting rid of single attribute draws really turns me off to it. Much easier to go dual/rainbow with off colors.  If they kept single draw I'd probably run off to my main instead of playing my alt and draw WW until Hyunmu popped out.
soccerspirits,3crfao,Anal_Llama,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:07:22 2015 UTC,It just that WW is too strong they got no weakness. While other Color have some kind of weakness. Thunder have no dmg reduction GK and lack reflex buff (unless you use Nerua ace) Ardor Lucian no EE and lack HP totem for Def line and also no Pen for Striker Light . . . pure bad. Dark - Ronald still no EE. No Hp totem at all. But their debuff just pure OPness
soccerspirits,3crfao,erehinater,2,Fri Jul 10 09:39:08 2015 UTC,"One reason may be because korean server is few months older, yet updates are made parallelly, so by the time hybrids were even introduced, their mono teams were almost finished and they just never changed their ways."

soccerspirits,3crfao,Azioria,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:43:39 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily true, because back when Korea was out and global wasnt nobody except WW could go mono because noone had GKs (Only Jin was EE and Kei and Zibroi sucked. everyone use Fusero the Rival). and there werent enough units to cover a mono team.

I'm currently running a primarily ardor/WW team with Lucian ace and an EE Bora as my striker. Given I somehow drew Serestia last week and I've got some other decent dark cards, I'm thinking Ravian could be a key piece to my future set up, especially as a long term improvement over Bora. I may even transition to rainbow and use EE Black Tortoise as GK for a while since Lucian STILL doesn't have an EE. However Milky Way is the big question mark. I haven't kept up with what's going on with her coming nerf/recall/whatever. Should I avoid her altogether and get Ravian, or is she still one of those MUST HAVE pieces that I'd be a fool to skip on?"

Milky way is still gonna be good after the nerf most likely but she's not op for u. bora not endgame unless you have teranox and ardor setup and anyway you won't run ardor as endgame so get ravian  edit: milky way not op right now b/c there are other more important cards you need for dark, but if you have the extra gp then get her"

soccerspirits,3cq6x1,lastra1,2,Fri Jul 10 20:38:49 2015 UTC,"Who don't you try Dark/WW or Dark/Ardor depending on your players. WW will be a better choice if you have Tortie, but you will need Saramir/Silk ace. You probably don't need explanation of difference between hybrids and rainbows.  Either way, if you're not going light, you may safely skip Milky. With nerf she merely stops being God of Destruction that destroys balance, but she's still one of the best reflex totems and counterattackers, but other elements have other ways to deal with stuff like that.  As for Ravian, she's definitely good if you build your team properly, here you got example of bad things /u/Dysoth is doing Tortoises."

Thanks in advance"
soccerspirits,3cq6x1,lastra1,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:07:49 2015 UTC,"If you choose either dark/WW or dark/ardor, you may want to use Zibroi as GK. While Kei is better in PvP, Zib is probably best GK for PvE. Zib will also recieve HP boost from ace.  If you were to go Dark/Ardor, waht you can look to replace are Tortoise, Eden and Saramir. While all are good players, they may not reach their full potential when off-color, same as Kei. Especially Eden, whose role doubles with Black Tortoise, but is probably weaker. Putting a penetrator there is wise choice, ardor's Lucius is good choice. You may also want to replace Saramir with another penetrator, since Long pass can only be used once per 15 mins while you can penetrate any time you have the ball. Second penetrator would definitely go to Malcolm if you get him, while he is similar to Lucius, he is known to being able to wield up to 3 counterattack resist stones which combats attackers' worst defect - low reflex making him one of the most reliable penetrators. You may want to stay with Tort, since I don't see a good replacement.  If you were to go Dark/WW, you may want to change Elaine, Victoria and again, Eden. If you were to aim for purity of color, instead of Lucius, you can try finding tankier Dale or fast Bird, but you can also put Malcolm here. While Malcolm is great for back penetrating denying stealers' efforts, with Saramir in the back, his penetrating may not be needed. For front totem, a Kiki would replace Elaine well, but you may try Elizabeth if you fully superb her, while she's not a great totem, she is a very good stealer, but you won't want her if you want to instant-kill opponents.  AS of now, dark/WW is fairly popular, but Elaine is a new unit and first good dark/ardor ace, so it's hard to rate dark/ardor decks at the moment.  On Vitos, he is not exceptional in anything but sheer power, but same can be said about such strikers as Hiro, Sharr or William.   Vitos is a fine striker, at least in theory, because he's pretty unpopular, mainly because mid game PvP has been plagued with Keis, some other may not like him suicide-killing (read: glass cannoning), making him become easy target to stealing. More on Vitos.   I'll also add, that later in game you may want to have extra striker to deal with Vitos' weaknesses, you may then choose Beatrice or Sharr depending on which color you choose."

soccerspirits,3cq6x1,lastra1,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:06:22 2015 UTC,"Vitos is a fine striker, at least in theory, because he's pretty unpopular, mainly because mid game PvP has been plagued with Keis, some other may not like him suicide-killing (read: glass cannoning), making him become easy target to stealing. More on Vitos.  For Superbing, three syllabes: Me-ta-tron! Get all her passives, then do you Baltheon. In theory, Vitos and Zibroi should get them first to the max, because they're most important players out there, but if you feel you don't need more, than you're free to skip them for a while.  Took longer, but your team may look like this:  For PvP, making Metatron CM is common choice, because she most awesome in that position. Dale for linebreaking and Sammy for stealing will make a good balance. Defense, speed modifiers like Lia and Magnus will help you steal the ball before enemy makes a shot and Anael is best at stealing. However, note that most common strategy is to boost GK to make him survive the shot and penetrate with the ball. For that sake you may want to find Mikael, Nerua, Yuri and Kiki, but also Malcolm for one of the best and most reliable penetrators. Throw in some extra Orses, I'm not a fan of her, but with limited resources, she's fair choice.          Theon Durahan Vitos   Sammy Metatron Dale   Magnus Anael Lia    Zib     For PvE, you will want some healers like Sammy or Virgil. Sammy is not needed much, because Zib has his own heal, but she helps the line greatly. You may want to find Avnore for Virgilsince he's best healer and awesome debuffer to stack with your other speed/reflex debuffers, that can also be useful in PvP. In Sammy's place, any totem would do, but you may want to put Malcolm in place of Lia, simply because can use long pass only once per 15 min.          Theon Durahan Vitos   Milky/Ari Metatron Dale   Sammy/Magnus Virgil Lia    Zib"
soccerspirits,3cq6x1,Shizuku_chan,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:34:08 2015 UTC,"Could I Ask why u put Milky/Ari LWM, also isn't Meta best put infront of the striker so zib gets a 30% heal? I generally don't use Virgils heals, I only used him for penetrating. I also like Lia's speed buff/active and her 20%/30% reduce to the enemy so i was thinking maybe avnore/meta/dale mid? and sammy/GK buffer ( e.g nerua, magnus) | Lia | Malcolm"
soccerspirits,3cq6x1,lastra1,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:16:22 2015 UTC,"Iv PvE, you only need to break on one side, so the other side can be used to boost you penetrator, Milky and Ari can do that. Of course, you can switch sides, but do remember that sometimes it's better to penetrate one side than another, so remembering that you can use either side can sometimes decide win or lose.  Putting Metatron is certainly one way to look at it, but Metatron is way to awesome to treat her like a meatshield, or maybe specialised defense line is too small to fit extra healer. Zibroi's own heal is often enough when combined with active healer like Avn. To support that, try viewing these vids. He clears highest floors with mentioned tactics and Meta CM.  Of course, you are free to play the way you like the most, as advisor, I only give you one of possibilities that is likely to succeed."

As for Baltheon, both choices are not bad. Place him in center if you want him to steal/counter with his above average reflexes, but reversely you put him on side to minimise chances for opponent to steal from him before she passes. While he his favorited position is in center, placing him on side is far more popular."

Kei is the universally good one. You may change them in future, or not.  Blade needs crit rate and Iggy can provide it and steal well too, but you may want to get Victoria, less crit rate for Blade, but more total buffs. Luka is a thunder passer, but as of now, Silla is performing much better. You may also want to try Nari for this position for more crit rate.  You can use Bell in almost any position, also as crit totem for Blade, but she is awesome penetrator, so using her mid/back is more advisable. If you use her back, a Guin can be used in mid, but you prefer Bell in mid, a Mikael is better in the back.  For ace, you can choose either Jury or Nerua, both are awesome. In case you didn't use a thunder GK, you may want not to EE Nerua, because with EE, her line buff becomes team-wide thunder buff.     Light/Ardor     Love Milky Silla   Anael/Bell Sammy Mikael/Lia/Veronica/Love   Yuri Nerua Bell/Mikael    Kei     This set up will need you to find Love!

I've heard of people using Zibroi using CM - try putting him there, moving Valkia to the side, and using Jin as GK. Otherwise, your team is still very much under development.

soccerspirits,3cq6x1,lastra1,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:00:53 2015 UTC,"Data has been taken on hell difficulty (lower than ultimate). While I'm not sure how strong you need to be to clear it, you should still give it a try. I'll also admit that I'm not sure if you get points for challenging it, but not clearing it, but you have 2.5% to get Alkyde herself on Hell if you win, so it's worth to try.   As I said earlier, you can do around 600-900 more points (free ST), probably a bit more if you use ST that comes in mail and use the bell event, so getting few points during the weekend will help you, otherwise you'll be taking a fair risk of not getting her. You're likely to finish it without need to spend crystals, but keep an eye on progress and remember that you can farm minions only on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. However that's cold calculation that assumes you have enough time to spend most the ST you get, if you get sudden and urgent work on one of those days, everything can go puff."

I farmed over 900 with only what regenerates/no packs is an answer, so it's definitely possible. Since minion difficulty doesn't affect boss points much, it should be still possible as long as you always win and since you said yourself you have some time to spare, it should definitely be possible. If you add few free packs, you potentially you can get even more.  So my answer is ""normally"".

soccerspirits,3cq6x1,AVusion,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:47:54 2015 UTC,"You and your friend should always keep an eye out for Legendaries, never skip them in scout and ask for advice on reddit if needed. Almost all legends are useable.    Looking at your legendaries, you could go Ardor/Light hybrid. In this case you need Sammy's ACE (you could use her in any light based team, since she is one of the best ballholders). You could also go Ardor/Thunder with Jean and Raklett, but I don't know anything about Jean or if he is good. Units you should scout: - Ardor/Light: Sammy, Kei, Silla, Sharr, Hiro or Uriel, Mikael, Kevin, Yuri, Mariel - Ardor/Thunder: Blade, Nari or Luka, Veronica, Hildegard, Nerua  Your friend could make a Dark hybrid team, I wouldn't go mono dark since they are lacking in certain positions in PVP. He already has Lucid - Baltheon, which is a strong combo for Colosseum. He should scout Yuri, Kevin or Jeunese for his frontline to complete his front. As for GK he could go Zibroi, but Zibroi is only useful in PVE, in PVP he sucks... Unless you use Zibroi as ballholder. Ronald is better for PVP but not as good as Zibroi in PVE, he might get an EE but that's not sure. He could also go off colour and get Kei who is good in both PVP and PVE, but will lack an ACE boost. Other units he should scout are Avnore (healer), Malcolm, Dale (Mono Dark), Saramir or Silk (Dark/Whirlwind ACE), Elaine (Dark/Ardor ACE).    I probably forgot a couple units =/"

soccerspirits,3cq6x1,ciccati,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:23:38 2015 UTC,"Rank 30 it's a bit too early to think about end game, but you might start to consider what you want to do first and where you want to orient your team. You should look for a passer first since blue dragon is a good 4* until you get something better and racklet will get an ee ""soon"" so she will be fine atm. Seeing that you have beth and shu, you might consider to get sammy and go for a light/ardor team. Also in scouts you could look for sammy, mikael, nerua, kiki, silla for now. About your friend isillia is quite good she recently got an ee. Lucid with baltheon are good too so he might start evolving lucid first.  About his team i think it's too early to choose the attribute. It will be hybrid dark/something, but it depends on what he will get next. For example with metatron he could go light/dark. He just have to decide what to do based on what he gets next so i don't think i can give advice on scouts. Also take a look at This, it might be helpful."

If we concentrate on making best use of legendary players, the most obvious choices are for you to go Light/Ardor with Sammy ace while your friend should go mono-Dark or Dark/WW with Dale and Saramir/Silk respectively. Choice to play a rainbow (which is in short a mish-mash of all colours) based on Silla ace.  Universally good players (mostly totems) include Nerua, Yuri, Kiki or Mikael.  Apart from those units above and aces, you may want on your scouting list players named as staples in this guide for respective elements. Note that it does not mention any strikers, because you should take a bit more time to decide on the most important player."

If this is a PvE team then I think Magnus to replace Shu and Yuri to replace Kevin would be a lot better. Long pass to skip to the front then do damage, wait until it Lia's cool down ends then long pass again. To do this though it's preferred to have someone with coexistence in the back like Linmay so if you're going up against a ardor or dark PvE team then use Magnus, if not then use Yuri while Linmay takes the other unit's slot.   If you're talking about PvP though then you definitely need to change your back line. HP and crit resistance totems are mandatory. I'd replace Kevin with Yuri and Shu with Magnus just like the PvE team except remove Lia and replace her with Shu. So...          Beatrice Neraizel Kiki   Victoria Jury Enthia   Yuri Shu Magnus    Lucian     and another HP/critical resistance totem for support like Nerua if you manage to find one for the back line."

With more crit chance spirit stones (green crit stone, 2x blue crit chance + receive pass effect) and Silla as a front line totem, those pesky goal keepers are a thing of the past. You won't 1hko them since you're starting to hit the stage where people have fully superb'd goal keepers as well and it'd be a little silly of a fully superb'd striker could 1hko a fully superb'd goal keeper. It'd be a really bias game for the offensive line ups!  That being said, Sharr has an inherit advantage because most people in higher level PvP use King Jin and with the 25% attribute bonus, it's extra damage just for being ardor. She also has an extremely potent skill set so she's definitely a contender for best striker for PvP. I ended up sticking with Beatrice because I'm so attached to her and I'll continue being loyal because she was my first unit. If you have no attachments though, Sharr is clearly the better striker until they announce those WW buffs. Who knows what they'll do to Beatrice though. (20% dmg to all enemy units pls)"

If you're speaking about PvP then it's acceptable to use Nerua as a support and keep Niarose as your ace since you seem to have a lot of dark and ardor units. However you should consider moving away from Niarose ace until her EE gets announced and she's broken since she isn't that great as a unit.

If not then I suggest moving away since she doesn't help Hiro as his crit rate is fine without her pass if you invest into some crit spirit stones. Luka is a better alternative I think and with her EE coming up, she'll definitely be better for Hiro since he has no skills that boost penetration power.   Another huge problem I see is that you don't have any defensive buffs other than Eden in the back. Your poor Reto doesn't have anyone helping her! You should be looking for some totems like Kiki, Nerua, Yuri to make your goal keeper tankier be it Reto or Kei.  I recommend changing your line up to something like           Hiro Luka Silla   Jury Sammy Hildegard   Nerua Cynthia Mikael    Kei     with another unit to buff your back line's health like Kiki or Yuri. If you plan on keeping Cynthia in the back then I recommend Yuri for the counter attack resistance in addition to Nerua's, it saves you from Ravian and Kirin line ups."

Other good backline totems are kiki and yuri (replace sammy in pvp). Cynthia can stay if you find her teamwide speed debuff useful, if not Saramir works for the crit debuff.

Currently she's only L/D ace while another is not yet obtainable, so as for now, going L/D without her is simply pointless.  Yuri's totem skills are best either in front or back, I rarely see someone use her in mid. I also don't see why you play Jury at defence, so it's about the right thing to swap those two. Jury's best used as CM (which is the same as Sammy) making Elizabeth movable to right side.  For Ravian, Alkyde is probably best passer. A reflex totem would also be good like Daisy (old boss, dark), Meiran, Veronica or Victoria to max Ravian's counter chance."

soccerspirits,3cq6x1,theterrorblade,2,Fri Jul 10 00:23:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah Nerua is definitely ridiculous and works no matter what team she's on. Besides her, . . . it's gonna be really rough since you need all of the WW/Dark legends to make it a good team. Metatron, Baltheon, Jin, & Khirel. Metatron to replace Jury, Baltheon to replace White Tiger, Jin for Zibroi and Khirel for Anael in my previous post.  The only changes I would make in terms of regular units would be Neraizel for White Tiger and Nerua for Mira, and Silla for Elizabeth for PvP. Elizabeth is actually pretty decent and replacing her with Silla wouldn't be that big of a difference but in auto mode it's risky to run on-pass effects since there's no guaranteeing the AI will prioritize getting the ball to Elizabeth and getting her to pass for the effect to go off. In manual though, it's fine.   An alternative you could do is to use Magnus for the back line to replace Kiki and bring Kiki to the front to replace Elizabeth. It's also a decent setup but Kiki's buffs are purely dependent on your assist passing to your striker, so if Beatrice is the first to get the ball and shoots then you didn't benefit whatsoever from your two other units. That's why I prefer Silla totem since the +30% attack and penetration are consistently buffing her.  G-good luck on your journey. Getting 4 legends is no joke..."

For now, I'll stick with whatever non-legends I can get. Thanks a lot for your help!"

If the new skin system also allowed one to change the base color/faction of the player (does not even have to change the ace effect or skills)  Because Metatron and some of the fallen angels and demons already had angel forms from the past those could be the skins and of course they were light before they fell. Also players like milky way and etc are humans that got lost or died so they should have ardor versions of themselves as skins.  You can go nuts with green animal themed (Lucid with bunny outfit for example), pre-versions, blue android/mecha versions, light einherjar versions etc etc to justify the color shifts."

soccerspirits,3cpfef,patthpapong,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:45:10 2015 UTC,"To add what I don't think have been said here yet: new character chain system lets you gain substantial stat boost when specific players are on the same/ opposite teams, so look into that. This made Sam/ Noa a tiny bit less obsolete as they have chains with a lot of characters, but it doesn't really get them off the bench. You also farm dimension stones by completing chains for each character (amount of stones vary depending on player's natural star grade). This means if you don't need the GP right away it's in your best interest to save a copy of each card to conveniently do chains. Rivals/bosses are also in chains so it's an incentive to get these cards even if you don't plan to use them.  Star grades don't increase with evolution, only special training. max level is determined by star grade: 2 star = max lvl 20, etc. Legendaries are born 6 stars and are already ballers so they don't need no special training. you also don't have to be max level to evolve, and with that change the exp curve to get to max level was modified. The whole evolve change has been one snowballing thing: you no longer get crystals for evolving 2 star cards for the first time, and selling evolved cards no longer yield higher GP.  Oh and across the board rank 30 achievement will give you a legend, not sure if you checked what u got yet.  penguin matches take a bit longer now, and don't really feel worth the while with the new exp curve, you're better off purchasing 6 star penguin matches using crystals. regular x2 exp and gold hours are gone, only come during events. I'm not sure if i got this detail right someone correct me if im wrong: season 2 five star players are only obtainable through draws, they won't appear in scouts.  ....phew, that ran a lot longer than i thought."

Do you want to hit Galaxy league? Maybe finish story mode in challenge and hell mode if you haven't already? Farm up all the rivals and bosses and make a run at the super bosses (which are as you can probably guess- harder bosses)? Get a 100 win arena streak?

soccerspirits,3cpu2r,Raikaru,-1,Fri Jul 10 01:39:25 2015 UTC,"It's pretty easy to have a passive 30-50% crit resist on mid-liners, so ya your cynthia may have like 80% or something naturally with reasonable stones, so you get like 30% crit-rate.. not great in my eyes.  Point with blade is that you have to invest all of your resources into getting that crit, not into amplifying damage - yes she CAN crit, but I didn't claim she couldn't, I said you have to put all your effort (stones/totems) into making sure she does.. you're probably not going to be running silla/guin/yuri/blade with stones for atk/penn/crit-damage.  Not saying blade is bad at all, she's my first and favorite striker.. but sharr (for pvp) is better - both in the meta and for not having to focus all of your efforts into crit."
soccerspirits,3cpu2r,ShengrenR,2,Fri Jul 10 02:04:00 2015 UTC,People don't run crit Resist mids lmao. Also why wouldn't you run Silla? Blade Veronica Silla is fine. Cynthia can crit. Just look at anyone who uses her PvP vids. 0 difficultly critting

If your kei isn't 5/5+120, obviously that's an issue as well, need a tanky GK.. also a (or two) yellow crit stone with HP on crit is pretty useful, that should cover your defense, then you just have to figure out how to kill their goalie :p"

It's really a bad move since with that blacklist, they are even blocking legitimate players."
soccerspirits,3cpj6j,Fasgort,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:20:37 2015 UTC,"If they're actually doing that then it's a pretty terrible move. I like playing on my computer since it's a bigger screen and much smoother experience, and the fact that I can use my mouse too (plus record/take screenshots easier). My phone is like 3 years old (Samsung Galaxy Nexus), and SS is kinda choppy on that."
soccerspirits,3cpj6j,Bisonh4x,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:44:23 2015 UTC,Well I'm sure some of it is to help stop self referrals. It won't if you know what to do but a lot of people only know about using emulators.
soccerspirits,3cpj6j,SuffferinSucccotash,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:37:46 2015 UTC,Maybe they will only fixed it when they realized they are actually hurting themselves by doing it. Am not really impressed with mobile game companies in general. shrug

soccerspirits,3cnkm5,jediarecool,5,Thu Jul 9 17:04:22 2015 UTC,"Event details are up in-game. Basically, you get 1 point for every match (no matter where!) you win - anything using more than 11 ST is granted two points. Top 50 players who contributed the most points get special prizes. All players contributing points get prizes based on total accumulated points:   3,000,000 points - 50 ST x3  5,000,000 points - 100k gold  10,000,000 points - 50 crystals  17,000,000 points - 2x 5-Star Swirly Boxes  30,000,000 points - 5-Star Player Box  Crystals will be handed to players within the top 50, and you must earn at least 100 points to get accumulated prizes. There's also a refund event for spending 50 ST - you get 50 ST back!  For those curious about crystal prizes, #1 - 500 crystals, #2-10 - 200 Crystals, #11-50 - 100 Crystals."

soccerspirits,3cnkm5,Melsh0312,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:22:07 2015 UTC,Probably like the relay event? Spend x amount of ST/BP/battle balls and get y amount of points?
soccerspirits,3cnkm5,AmoebaCel,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:16:56 2015 UTC,I'm getting the whole bunch of php errors instead of event description ingame. The saem shit as with Cosplay Poll T_T
soccerspirits,3cnkm5,tsubatsu,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:40:40 2015 UTC,"NVM, solved by switching default phone language to english. Duh..."
soccerspirits,3cnkm5,tsubatsu,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:53:40 2015 UTC,So basically to come first you need to spend 500 crystals... to get 500 crystals.
soccerspirits,3cnkm5,Shahadah,2,Thu Jul 9 09:04:05 2015 UTC,500 wont nearly be enough
soccerspirits,3cnkm5,littlejoey171,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:44:07 2015 UTC,If that is true that is actually worth it since you basically get 500 crystals worth of ST for free

soccerspirits,3cnkm5,Moonsolol,-1,Fri Jul 10 15:35:34 2015 UTC,I would be interested looking at which of you guys who would waste your life doing this just to try to get into top 50. Its not worth the time obviously.
soccerspirits,3cnkm5,KakkoiiAline,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:54:47 2015 UTC,And then it turns out everyone has that exact same mentality and a random 50 people who didn't care at all make it into the top
soccerspirits,3cnkm5,noarure,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:57:13 2015 UTC,Nah.. we knew that top 10 would consist of those who tried to get into number 1 and rank 11 below is those who failed :P
soccerspirits,3cnkm5,KakkoiiAline,0,Thu Jul 9 09:00:01 2015 UTC,"1 point for every win in story mode, space time, galaxy league, arena and the colo.  2 points for more than 11ST spent.  Top 50 get crystals which is crazy for us to do because it count korea server too.  So freeload away~"
soccerspirits,3cnkm5,EfJun,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:21:01 2015 UTC,"For more than 11 ST, is there anything other than Alkyde boss match?"
soccerspirits,3cnkm5,lastra1,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:32:08 2015 UTC,rival matches.
soccerspirits,3cnkm5,SoccerHeli,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:37:30 2015 UTC,"Actually if you're dedicated enough, spamming 2 st matches would give you much more points than just playing normally. Of course, it would take days out of your life -_-"
soccerspirits,3cnkm5,littlejoey171,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:10:21 2015 UTC,Spamming 2 ST matches is how you will get Top 50. Not worth it to do for a couple weeks for a couple hundred crystals.
soccerspirits,3cnkm5,SoccerHeli,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:46:44 2015 UTC,I just checked the current top 50. HELL no. lol.   Yep time to just freeload :P
soccerspirits,3cnkm5,amornthep,-5,Thu Jul 9 12:58:28 2015 UTC,Just a waste of time for shitty rewards.
soccerspirits,3cnkm5,po1102,2,Thu Jul 9 09:46:29 2015 UTC,You get rewards for just playing normally. I don't see any reason to complain.

soccerspirits,3cnkm5,ssilverfrost278,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:22:38 2015 UTC,Only need to reach 100 points. No need to grind...
soccerspirits,3cnkm5,KakkoiiAline,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:19:22 2015 UTC,"Well most people are looking forward for the 100 points reward which are nice. And it was really easy, you just have to do daily missions! (those total would actually gave you atleast 28 points a day)"
soccerspirits,3colf2,Mimmo94,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:00:24 2015 UTC,"I got it with Kevin - Sammy - Avn - Kei with double light crit rate stone if it helps, but 42 is a tough one. Lucian + Nerua can potentially oppose Kirin, but never tested it, also there was one person saying Kirin one-shots his Lucian all the time (no Nerua)."
soccerspirits,3colf2,lastra1,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:28:32 2015 UTC,"So you did it with kei? Can I ask if you did it after the new patch for Guinevere (with new merciless she always get double atk). I have kei full spu, Sammy and Kevin but can't do it. Your Kevin skill set? He is spu/lvl 60? And your avnore?"
soccerspirits,3colf2,lastra1,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:55:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, I did it with Kei after Guin's Merciless buff.  Sammy full spu, Kevin had 1 and Avn 3. All lv 60. Kevin's Q-start and damage reduction."
