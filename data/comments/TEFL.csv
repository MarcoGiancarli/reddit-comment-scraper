I have never taught overseas and have not completed the course, but from what I've heard it's a good certification for a decent price. At least, if you're not planning on doing this for more than two years. I'm not. But, if you (or I) change your mind, they have CELTA course available in most of the countries I've looked into. Definitely Japan.  Also, about university recognition, some of the eikawas I've looked at mention ivy league schools as being a major plus. So it depends on the school."

TEFL,3e1m9r,supertrunks,2,Tue Jul 21 06:54:45 2015 UTC,You can pretty much sneak grammar points into conversations.  While you can't get them to write them out or read them the ability to use say tenses verbally can be an indicator as to if they're able to use that grammar point or not.

He knows what he wants, not what's best for him. So you can give him what he wants, the ability to have conversations. OR you can stop teaching him.  Some people just want a conversation partner. Just keep bringing interesting talking points. Try to naturally teach him conversation and spoken discourse. You can even try to sneak in some reading. Or quit.  Edit: I want to make it clear this is if you exhaust all other options which I assume OP did."
TEFL,3e1m9r,notadialect,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:10:01 2015 UTC,"This is what I'm thinking. I ask him to write something, with the idea of it being part of a bigger task to be used for something else.

I think I'm gonna try saying ""look you can do what I'm suggesting or we can just chat but I think the former will be more beneficial"". Also he keeps asking me for advice on his life."
TEFL,3e1m9r,Ctotheg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:35:44 2015 UTC,"Heads up.  Important questions to ask yourself:  Why do you want him to write something? Why do you want to teach him grammar? Have you taught conversational training before? Do you have experience teaching privately? Are you ABSOLUTELY SURE teaching him grammar will help him learn spoken English?  I'm not trying to snipe at you, I'm trying to understand clearly why you're aiming to ""slip in"" grammar into a private lesson, as if you'll successfully... what? trick him?  You might find that he'll just resent you and not look forward to your lesson if you do that.   Your grammar-focused approach is somewhat of a common rocky road among young instructors.  I know because I own a language school, and have been training for 20 years in Tokyo.  Forcing grammar on students? particularly after they specifically demand that you don't?  I think that's the wrong approach.  If he is a private student why don't you try a new method?  Especially if he specifically asked for ""no grammar."" You might lose him if you add grammar.  Focus on conversation training by teaching him commonly-used phrases to use through textbooks which deliver increasingly difficult grammar examples.  Go through a textbook like American Headway or Passport for inspiration.    Don't do conversation training without a text, particularly in this case. Textbooks are designed to teach and use grammar THROUGH the conversations, thereby solving your exact problem.  Use a textbook which is specifically designed for ESL, not a grammar text. Focus on situational based lessons that match his needs so that he can successfully    go to the bank and withdraw cash order food in a cafe  find his destination and get a bus ticket ask his instructor detailed info about class information ask his boss about work schedules successfully answer questions about his job attend a meeting and take notes   Notice how these activities are increasing in difficulty and slide further into business english.  He's 24 so he will need work related phrases.  He's an intermediate speaker then you shouldn't be bothering or even focused on bringing grammar as an explicit teaching point into the lesson anyway.  It will just take up time and he will completely lose interest.    Grammar is not interesting for the student at all - only for the instructor.  Find a way to teach English through natural examples by using professionally written textbooks by Oxford and Cambridge publishers designed for the Asian market.  This is a popular website with reviews of the textbooks. http://www.eltbooks.com/home.php  Source:  been teaching in Japan for 20 years and only teach grammar explicitly when students demand it, and they never do."

They have two CELTA classes running at the moment, with 6 students in each.  I had a chat with a couple of them at break and they are all pretty stressed and frazzled-  apparently it's a really intensive course.  They were happy with their choice of Lexis though, so I'll give it a go.   The campus itself is really nice - it looks straight out over the beach.  There are a LOT of international students there, which was a bit of a wake up for me as I always think in terms of single culture classes (in my case, all Japanese).

The problem for Japan's Eikawas is that there are two types of foreigners in Japan. There's the people who end up there due to language study, work, wife, husband etc and most are usually pretty qualified for something better than teaching English to kids and house wives and the freaks who are obsessed with Japan, the culture, the women etc.  Now the freaks are avoided like the plague, most companies have a couple from desperation, I worked with some. But if you are honest, clean and well presented, speak clearly, punctual and are willing to give it a good shot, you should get some offers.  The visa is the tricky part. Are you both under 30? If so, you can go the working holiday visa route and go out there and apply like mad from day one. Otherwise you'll need to be sponsored which can be a little difficult but in no way impossible.  https://jobs.gaijinpot.com  Apply for some jobs there, you can gauge interest in yourselves and see what happens. You should get a couple Skype interviews and if you're really interested in saving, then living in the countryside would be very beneficial both for you cost wise and the company because all the foreigners want to go to Osaka or Tokyo.

It's not the ""wild west"" of TEFL anymore, like it was in the '90s; schools can demand more educated teachers since there's no shortage of BA holders wanting to work abroad. You may find under-the-table work, as ballena8892 mentioned, but generally schools will want a teacher with a degree, not simply a high school diploma and a year's experience tutoring. I'm not trying to be unkind, but when there are loads of highly experienced teachers with BAs and BEds, there's no impetus to hire someone so young without a lick of secondary education."

As if it is a decent teaching place (I mean decent to the students) you'll be expected to prep lesson plans and also do a bit of pastoral care (1-1 with students to discuss any learning problems).  HOWEVER!  One situation where it is possible and I'm not saying this is good. Are situations where many of the classes are duplicated. July for instance I got some additional hours an extra 10 a week. This is on top of my regular 18. Seems bad right?   Except those 10 hours are split into 4 2.5 hour classes. All of them are the same level. Therefore one lesson plan for all 4 classes is absolutely fine. They are also higher level classes so I don't spend the whole lesson talking and get them to talk and write instead. Although I incorporate a lot of written work I structure it in such a manner that I don't spend forever marking.

If you're in south China and have a sexual orientation partial to women, ladies' fashion is easy on the eyes in the summer.  The downsides are that most of the foreigners are alcoholics here. A lot of the locals as well. Alcohol is cheap and easily available, making it an easy way to deal with stress.

South Korea is harder to find a job but the living conditions/wages are a bit better.    I mean; petrol, cars, electronics, travel outside of the country.  They are all pretty much the same as in SK and they are the major costs for me.

I know this because one of my students copied three paragraphs off my MEd dissertation. He tried to disguise it by adding additional words.  Let me look for it...

The more detailed analysis involved manually reading each of the extracts individually and a categorisation by hand of each extract.   He put  Due to general weaknesses and problems in the usage of CAQDAS. A more detailed observation and analysis was needed.

I signed up with all of them and within a week my phone was ringing off the hook with interviews.  BTW the best advice that I can give you is to have a Back Up Plan in case you have to come home. My Back Up Plan was not good and I quickly ran out of money.   Also try Taiwan. Taiwan was much better than Korea. You get a motor scooter in Taiwan.

It's seen as the ultimate sign of aimlessness.   Edit: Go for it. I originally planned to go to law school too. I currently teach in Vietnam. It's a lot of fun; a fairly stress free lifestyle. One year abroad probably won't harm your long term career projectory. Do you have any specific questions?"

Thus, the LSAT severely outweighs any other influence on the trajectory of a legal career, making what I decide to do during my gap year(s) pretty secondary.  Edit: Nice!

I mostly chose it based off my own Google research. I got a CELTA here and now work at the same center. It's definitely a good idea to get certification where you want to work.

Actually, I found that many more than not recommended tefl for gap years, but I'll keep digging anyway to make an informed decision.  Do you think the CELTA course gave you a competitive edge in landing a gig? I ask because I also see CELTA being offered in Cuenca. And how has whether or not knowing Thai affected your outcome there? Thanks again for sharing your insight :)"
TEFL,3dmvzn,dcrm,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:18:38 2015 UTC,"1) Celta will either give you an advantage in certain places (China) or be almost a requirement (SK).  A quick search and it seems that it's not a requirement in Cuenca but it can help you get a better job so if you are sure that's what you want to do I would take the CELTA.  More qualifications don't hurt your chances in the future and a CELTA looks like you are at least trying to be good at your job.  2) TEFL for 1 year will not look bad, it'll look as if you wanted to take a gap year and explore the world and try something different before you go into work.  TEFL for 2-3 years is riskier and more than that and you will start to get asked serious questions.  I did it for one year and I found it detrimental to my career (although not hugely).  It just meant that the wage rise I'd have got for moving jobs was less than if I had not taken time out.    I'll give you an example of some questions raised at my interviews;  ""So why did you choose to do teach abroad"", ""Did you get any qualifications for this?"", ""When is the last time you touched a live system"", ""Do you think you will do it again?"".  One woman in particular was curious how taking time out would effect my performance and it did by maybe 15%.  If I was out of it for 2-3 year I'd have forgotten so much.  In your case it isn't as much of a factor because you plan to go to law school but I don't think most people will look at TEFL as an advantage - better than doing nothing for years though!"

If actual working days are less than one month, the salary will be paid by actual working days (22 working days each month). Salary for each day is unchangeable, which is calculated by monthly salary after tax / 22 days.   I definitely feel like they are pushing me and it makes me very nervous."

Last thing you want to do is to be facing a drug smuggling crime because you weren't aware of the rules. I take medication for a life long disease and had to set up an elaborate way to get my medication with me into Russia. It was never illegal, but wasn't legal (as in prescribed in country) either. I had to be the one to bring it with me and always had had to have all documents showing that I did in fact have said disease and have copies of my prescription and a note from the prescribing physician.

It will be a big negative if you list it, so don't."
TEFL,3dnk38,adarcone214,2,Sat Jul 18 12:23:19 2015 UTC,"I told my company about my condition when I was signing the contract, with the understanding that they weren't paying for it, and that all drs had stated that I was in good health and had no reason to not work.   It could be a conversation worth having with your employer, but these things can go either way. I took a risk, but it turned out well. Ended up only being sick twice (once with food poisoning, because i ate meat that wasn't cooked well but was also old - it was inside a pie, and the other time was with the flu). It could even be worth mentioning it a few months into your contract. That way you have a precedent to show that your medication/condition isn't interfering with your job.   In my experience, there really isn't a good time or way to inform an employer that you have something that ""may"" at some point in the future have an effect on your job performance. It can also be a personal decision.   Sorry if there isn't a good way to handle this, or a direct answer but that is the reality. Even if you have an awesome resume/cv employers will still look at you as a risk. It can also depend on how desperate they are to fill the spot. In the end, you kind of need to do what is best for you."

With CELTA - at least in my course - your instructors will go out of their way to help you find ways to prepare for everything. Yes, they expect a lot out of you, but they're not mean. Tell them your fears. Anytime I or someone else struggled, they were willing to give some really great tips. They won't do your work for you, but they can definitely set you on the right track.  Also, get to know your classmates. They're going to be your best friends throughout weeks of the course. Everyone in my course proof-read each others works, gave hints and help for teaching, and stuff like that. I doubt I would have passed without the encouragement of some of my classmates. Again, they won't do your work for you, but befriending everyone in your course can give you some great support.   Work hard, have some people in CELTA you can fall back on, and accept that there's going to be some nights when you might not get much sleep.

The pass rate for CELTA is particularly high for my area (London), if you have worked in a stressful industry before, CELTA has nothing on it.    Just remember it could always be worse, I did a 12 week part time CELTA whilst working full time in a software engineering job.  It was pretty harsh but doable.

TEFL,3didyz,telex1,3,Thu Jul 16 17:16:14 2015 UTC,Agree with this. It is no use moving to Korea cos it is easier if you dont like it there. You would become demotivated pretty quickly
TEFL,3didyz,Teamonsterggg,4,Fri Jul 17 00:23:02 2015 UTC,"Japanese is easier and more forgiving. If you mispronounce a single vowel in any word in a sentence in Korean people will not be able to understand you, but I've seen some horrific mangling of Japanese and people understand just fine.  People will also tell you the alphabet makes things easier, but it also slows your ability to learn from morphology to a crawl. At an intermediate level it's quite easy to encounter a new word in Japanese and understand its meaning instantly because of the relationship between characters and root words. This skill takes much much longer to build in Korean despite the huge shared vocabulary between the two languages.  The big downside to Japanese is the characters, but you can learn enough to read 90% of all information within a year if you learn the right way to study."

TEFL,3didyz,jostler57,2,Thu Jul 16 21:40:53 2015 UTC,"Probably Korean on account of the script being much easier. In Japanese you could be looking at a text with words that you know, but you cant read it if yo havent memorised the kanji.   This might be misleading though, as Korean will have its own frustrations. Also, knowing Hangul doesnt necessarily mean you can read Korean.  But learning to read Japanese surely takes longer.   Another point to consider could be the relevance of each language during and after your stay. Korea is far more accommodating to people who don't speak Korean, and they dont expect you to learn at all, generally. In Japan, I think you are expected to at least try and learn a bit. Even for some entry level teaching jobs here they might want you to have some ability.   Your Korean friends will probably be mostly people wanting to practise English. Whereas in Japan you might struggle to make friends who can actually speak English, but can meet a lot of people who want to get to know you if you can communicate with them well in Japanese.  Then further to this, you might want to think on into the future as to which will be more useful. For example, in Korea 99% of the foreigners there are English Teachers, whilst Japan has a wider range of jobs you can do IF you can speak Japanese well. Id also imagine Japanese is more relevant outside of Japan as their economy is still very powerful.  As for getting conversational in Japanese, dont expect miracles but just try as hard as you can. You probably wont be ""conversational"" but you might be able to have some fun with it."
TEFL,3didyz,Teamonsterggg,2,Fri Jul 17 00:16:03 2015 UTC,"Korean is a fair bit easier to learn as you'll be entirely on top of the written language in a week.

As far as spoken communication is concerned, they are both pretty similar."
TEFL,3didyz,Shudai,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:38:57 2015 UTC,"Since you say ""conversational"" I'm going to have to go with Japanese. Japanese has fewer vowels, which would make it an easier spoken language. It also has a much lower instance of CVC than Korean. Korean also has ""tense"" consonants, which I can understand lingustically, but still have some difficulty replicating. Both have consonant mutation, which takes some getting used to. Both languages have similar grammar, which is very different from English. Korean's obviously easier in written language, though."
TEFL,3didyz,pyrrhonic,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:09:51 2015 UTC,"FYI, no language is inherently easier or more difficult to learn. Usually these types of discussions are simply about L1/L2 distance, which isn't a good indicator of learning difficulty."

TEFL,3didyz,Teamonsterggg,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:57:50 2015 UTC,"I mean, I get where you are coming from and how you can make that assumption on how we initially learn the basics of a language. I also read your other post kind of outlining how Japanese and Korean differ with their basic linguistic areas and how each country (according to you) lets you get away with not knowing the language.  My biggest concern here is that once we start making assumptions about what languages are 'easier' (which is how people interpret it even if different terms are used) it instantly becomes a demotivating factor for people to learn 'difficult' languages. However, most Linguistic studies find no inherent difficulty differentiation between languages. I forget the name of the researcher but there is a theory that by design, languages will try to simplify whenever possible. I remember hearing about how the 3rd person pluralization of verbs (He plays)  is just a vestigial remnant of something that used to be much more prominent in English, but simply became less used as a way to simplify speech. (IMO, it's kind of ridiculous that we need to say 'He plays' now if the subject is already stated, that 's' doesn't do anything for the sentence)  In any case, there are a lot more relevant factors that influence how people learn a second language rather than the distance between L1 and L2, but they are much more complex and harder to deal with. It bugs me when people say 'xxxxxx language is easier because zzzzzzzz' when that usually has nothing to do with influencing how people acquire a second language."
TEFL,3didyz,preill,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:24:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah there are a lot of factors at work. I mean I agree it is daft to say one language is more difficult to learn than another.   I think it is useful to have a realistic idea of what you will need to do though as this will inform your studies and help you be more efficient.  To be able to say you are competent in Japanese, for example, you are going to need to know a few thousand symbols. This is a fact and you need to know this if you want to learn it. Languages that use the alphabet have no such hurdle. Korean has about 24 (?) This doesnt even need to be a negative point, and a lot of people really enjoy this aspect of Japanese, but it does take time.   I dont know what you count as research but this is from the US foreign service about classroom hours http://www.thecultureist.com/2014/05/27/spanish-korean-easiest-hardest-languages-learn-infographic/ . It doesnt make any distinction between Korean and Japanese in terms of difficulty by the way! Perhaps this sort of thing is what you mean by damaging?!   Ive lived in both countries for similar amounts of time, and knowing hangul didnt mean I could read Korean.

Your school may pay some of your salary upfront if you tell them about your situation but i wouldn't hold your breath.

Knowing any khmer/culture in this regard gets you a lot of respect and opens TONS of doors.  you can work for RULE or PUC (I love PUC because I was a student there) for $1000/mo + depending on who you know, background, etc. Or you can spirit yourself into one of many schools looking for an English teacher. It's all in person-interviews and applications. The visa process is absurdly easy (pay something like $250 to stay for a year, nothing else needed besides a passport)  you can live comfy off of $500/per month but won't save much, or you can be frugal and save an okay ammount of money ( but nothing special). It's not a great place for paying off loans quick,  but you get the satisfaction of helping people who will be making a livelyhood on the skills you teach them.

Upon arrival there were some incurred fees (health check, overweight luggage, payment for an Alien Registration Card) which added about $150.   It really depends on your style of living. Some people were lucky and the previous tenant left many things in the apartment. Most people had to go out shopping for pots, pans, clothes hangers, forks, cups, etc. You will be paying transportation to and from school, so figure at least $100 a month depending on your area. The lowest amount I heard someone brought was $700 but by the time the first pay check arrived he was struggling. If you can afford it, you could always apply for a credit card with zero foreign transaction fees (Chase Venture Card for example) and pay for most things on credit the first month.  After the first paycheck I was given 1.3million won for my flight (roughly $1200) and a resettlement fee of 300,000won (roughly $200) which was intended to help pay for things in the apartment."
TEFL,3dfm9p,PrancingPudu,2,Thu Jul 16 07:44:17 2015 UTC,"Now isn't the right time for you. Fresh abroad, you won't have any real social safety net. Things can and do go wrong. Depending on where you're going, you ought to have at least two to five thousand dollars saved up, after airfare. You will spend much of that settling in. In China, for example, if you have to rent your own apartment, most landlords demand at least three months rent up front plus security deposit. You'll have to feed yourself. You'll have to pay for transportation. You might not receive your first paycheck until seven weeks after you begin working, depending on how your employer schedules salary payments.   You mentioned some ""drastic"" means of saving such as moving back in with your parents. That might not actually be so bad if it allows you to put away a few grand over some months. You could sell your car before you depart, certainly. You won't need it an ocean away.  If you're committed to the idea of teaching English overseas - and it is a rewarding experience - then take steps you need to get there safely and comfortably. Arriving broke or practically so is a recipe for a bad time. You'll have a lot going on when you first arrive, and worrying about money puts a big damper on things.  That said, while I haven't heard of starting bonuses, there are employers who are willing to front you some cash and deduct it in installments from your first several paychecks. It can be a boon."

I had moved back in with my parents after graduating, and while I wasn't originally planning on moving abroad, living on my own would have just been pissing money away.  If your long-term goal is to teach abroad, do what you can now to make that happen.  Move home, and plan to sell you car right before you leave!"
TEFL,3dfm9p,PrancingPudu,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:12:43 2015 UTC,"Yup, what /u/dcrm said.

Unexpected expenses can pop up anywhere, at any time. You'll quickly realize when you move abroad that not only are you thrust fully into financially independent adult life, but you have to battle language and cultural barriers while learning all the little things.   I don't say that to discourage you from coming, but to ensure you're more over-prepared than underprepared. Better safe than sorry, right?  Also, is there a particular reason why you're aiming for Korea?

From what I've researched so far, Korea seems to be the easiest and best paid place to start as an American with little experience teaching or traveling abroad. I also have multiple friends who have spent time in Korea, either as teachers, traveling, or with the US military, and all seem to have had positive experiences there.   However, I'm pretty open to other places. I was originally researching China because everyone I know who has started teaching there has ended up never wanting to leave, but a big sticking point seems to be the two year experience law.  I was also looking into Thailand, but the impression I get is that you need to actually apply to jobs in person there, so that would have to wait until I have enough saved to travel to thailand (and back if I don't get an offer).

TEFL,3dfm9p,PrancingPudu,3,Wed Jul 15 23:10:43 2015 UTC,"Don't rush it.  /u/SentinentCouch is bang on with their advice.  You really don't want to end up overseas and in a financially difficult situation where you can't properly communicate your problem because of a language barrier.  I've also never heard of a 2 year experience law in China--I know many people who have gone over and found jobs and done visa runs, as well as many who have gone there for their first year.  Both native English speakers, and those teaching other languages!  If you've never taught abroad before, the whole ""find a job in person"" thing can be pretty daunting.  I would do a year where you're ""assisted"" with things like an apartment, visa, and possibly flight just so you can settle into life in Asia a bit more easily.  Korea is great, but the EFL industry here is becoming more and more strained.  I live down in the province of Jeollanamdo, and there were massive cuts both in April and now for August contracts.  Jeollanamdo also still has many of the bonuses and perks that have since been cut for public school positions through programs like EPIK, and I'd consider their packages to be some of the top ones available in Korea.  Hagwons are always an option, but their salaries have been dropping steadily as well, expecting more experiences teachers to work for less.  Their focus seems to be on bringing highly qualified teachers over who have never taught abroad, and taking advantage of it being their ""first year teaching"" in Korea in terms of pay.  Hagwons are also very, very hit or miss.  Check out the waygook.org forums for multiple threads on what those of us currently living here are seeing and experiencing before you commit.    I would say China is a good option, especially because it's growing.  You're right that countries like Thailand and Cambodia's EFL programs are a little more rough around the edges and you have to apply in person for a lot of them.  China's benefits packages are growing and are becoming very stiff competition for Korea.  I know many teachers here who are heading (or have already headed) to China because of that.  For me personally, China put me off because of it's internet censorship and privacy, but there are ways around that.  I'm just stubborn and it was the principle of it, haha."

You don't need 2 years experience in China, my employer wrote me a letter of rec with absolutely no teaching experience.  We then went to the visa office together and they issued me it, no problem.  It could possibly vary from office to office as government staff in China act outside the scope of the law on a consistent basis, depending on relationships and other things."
TEFL,3dfm9p,drunkenbozo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:37:35 2015 UTC,"The wages in Korea these days aren't all that great, and I don't expect them to suddenly stop the slow downward creep they've been making.  There have been so many cuts just within the last year!  China was my second choice, but only because I'm stubborn and was salty over the privacy/censorship stuff, haha.  I agree that China is a really great start, and by the time OP is coming abroad, probably will be better than Korea."
TEFL,3dfm9p,dcrm,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:09:48 2015 UTC,"I've long wondered whether my hospitality management experience would count towards the whole ""2 year minimum experience"". Does the experience have to be in teaching (if you're looking for teaching work)? Can it work as is, or would I need to get my employers to up-sell my teaching/training qualities."
TEFL,3dfm9p,drunkenbozo,2,Thu Jul 16 16:34:01 2015 UTC,"If say the wages are fantastic in Korea, but it depends on your lifestyle obviously. I didn't buy furniture, I buy the cheapest beers/drinks when going out etc. I don't have any debts back home that need paying off so that's a contributing factor to how much I save (which is like $1000 a month). My biggest single expenses have been a $250 bicycle and... that's it. I could even save more if I really learned to grocery shop like a Korean (western groceries are quite expensive).   Occasionally I splurge, like any person really, but I'm not spending all my money at once and I'm saving a good amount of money.  I was able to get a cash-advance on my pay cheque when I started working so I could survive. I had just come from South East Asia and was lacking money... I'd say $1,500 is more than enough to get by comfortably before payday, but then again it depends on how well equipped your apartment is. Mine came with all the necessary kitchen tools and appliances so I was able to cook my own food. I had to buy linen and that was it as far as my apartment goes. Feel free to ask anything else about living an working here (I live in Busan)."
TEFL,3dfm9p,dcrm,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:46:25 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't say wages are fantastic, 1k USD savings isn't that much when locals in normal professional jobs can save about 3k USD in SK.  Not to mention wages are getting lower in TEFL but it's a hell of a lot more than china - probably 500 USD savings as a TEFL teacher.  $1500 might be enough but if things go wrong you are pretty screwed."
TEFL,3dfm9p,drunkenbozo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:00:54 2015 UTC,"I guess it's all about perspective. But given the hours I work and the salary I'm paid, I'd say in doing pretty well in comparison to professionals here in korea. I'm quite young too, and saving $1000 a month is crazy money. I never had more than a few grand from saving for a whole year.  Definitely agree about the last point. $1500 isn't enough for a safety net. I kinda went fuck it and jumped in. It all worked out well though."
TEFL,3dfm9p,dcrm,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:47:53 2015 UTC,"I think you are drastically underestimating Korean professionals, a quick search on glassdoor shows that the average salary for someone with my experience/role (I'm 27) is on about 70k-100k USD a year.  That's almost as much as I can get in London.  There are better Careers than what I do so that's not even the best example.  Even with tax on that they are probably twice if not three times better off than most qualified TEFL teachers halfway  through their career.  You couldn't afford a mortgage on 1k savings a month without living poorly.  It's probably a lot of money because you are young but it's really not in the grand scheme of things.  Also what I am quoting is the local salary, foreign expats are on more and the good ones can contract in Asia and earn $1,000 a day.  Not too difficult with the right sort of portfolio.  The work is less stressful as a TEFL teacher I'll give you that but the money sucks everywhere, most of all in Asia.  However, China is far less profitable than Korea although I prefer'd China."

He hid his lazy eye in his photo or had 'shopped it out, and when they saw him at the airport, the organizer simply turned around and left him there. Had an assistant come out a few hours later and tell the poor guy that his return date was being changed to RIGHT NOW and the signed contract was no longer valid.   My coworkers in Asia who were fat or unattractive were treated much worse than I was. Left out of photos, given worse classrooms, etc. A teacher with a missing hand will be treated poorly and pointed at by kids constantly. The school would possibly find some reason to get rid of you once you arrived to avoid the ""embarrassment"" of a disabled teacher.

TEFL,3dadjo,Annaeus,2,Tue Jul 14 21:18:47 2015 UTC,"The apostille is a certification by the state that a signature or seal on a public document is genuine. Inevitably that's going to limit what documents any given state will apostille as they will need to have records of what those signatures and seals look like, and what documents are valid for them to be applied to.  You should be able to get an apostille done by mail in the state where you went to school, though since you don't say where that is I can't check.  As for getting it notarized first, you may not need to do so. If it needs to be notarized, then it is the signature and stamp of the notary that are being apostilled. However, the state may consider degree certificates to be public documents, and directly apostille them, particularly if you went to a state school. Remember, only public documents can be apostilled, but which documents any given state considers to be public will vary. Notarial acts are always considered public documents though.  If you do have to go the apostille route, you will need to find out from the state where you went to school a) whether your diploma needs to be notarized, b) whether it needs to be notarized by a notary of that state (in which case your school might do it for you, to save you a road trip), and c) how to apply for the apostille (you may just have to mail the document with a check).  Be thankful that Korea is a party to the apostille convention, otherwise you would have to get it legalized instead: notarization, legalization by the state Secretary of State, legalization by the US Secretary of State (yup, John Kerry), confirmation by the embassy of the receiving country in the US, confirmation by the foreign ministry of the receiving country, and finally acceptance by whatever government department needed it in the first place."

You might end up having to do it by mail, which can take weeks.  Also, as it was explained to me, what you do is make a copy of your diploma, have a county clerk notary authorize the copy as a true copy (it must be in the county that you're getting it apostilled) and THEN get the copy apostilled.

Online certs are purely so you can bypass the ""cert required"" criterion found on many TEFL jobs.   So yeah they're worthless in that they're not exactly credible, and nobody will automatically assume they genuinely prepared you for teaching--there are no standards set for online certs, so whether yours is magically better than most is something your employer will not recognize.   Do you want to teach for at least a few years? Are you financially capable of getting the CELTA without having to go into debt or make it not worthy it otherwise? If yes to both, then maybe aim for the CELTA.   By the way, please read the FAQ and/or try to find your answer with the search box function. ""Should I get a CELTA?"" is like the most commonly asked question here ever.   Will the CELTA be worth it after you've already had a year or two of experience? Likely no, unless your future employer specifically makes a pay distinction for CELTA vs generic online cert--which they don't where I teach, as the pay is based on years of experience and higher degrees/certified teaching licenses. But YMMV.   The CELTA is just a month long program set up by a reputable business looking to make money.

TEFL,3d9ixo,Yestheyaredoingit,3,Tue Jul 14 15:40:12 2015 UTC,Could you post some info about the content and requirements?  From what you say the the trainer experience requirements alone mean that the course isn't likely to be CELTA clone - I would also guess that it is very much focused on teaching kids with little or no resources.  That said as experience on a CV it is going to look great and it may well be that you can talk your way past having a cert- which is after all just a way for a new teacher to demonstrate that they are serious  about teaching  I suspect you would still find the CELTA a challenge- it is for teaching adults and has really experienced trainers on it who will give you added value for money and will prepare you to teach in many different teaching environments.   There is also Cambridge DELTA (the follow up course to CELTA) which only requires (the right kind of ) experience (min 2 years). It is a really hardcore course however . . .
TEFL,3d9ixo,ai565ai565,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:22:25 2015 UTC,"Former RPCV here.  I'm happy that the Peace Corps has changed their TEFL program. I served from 2011-2013 and the TEFL training was kind of a joke.  We completed our teaching hours in an international school and then I was thrust out into a village...which had mixed results to say the least.   I don't look back at my time there in a negative light. I learned a lot, helped my school, and helped the students that really wanted to learn. But I was definitely not equipped for the first year of teaching.  I'm sorry to hear that you are getting stuck in the bureaucracy of PC and might get shorted a certificate. I earned my CELTA certification in my host country after I completed my service.   If you are serious about TEFL as a career, I would recommend going for a CELTA. When I talked to the TEFL director of my Peace Corps country, she said that many of the facets that CELTA covers were going to be covered by the new Peace Corps TEFL program as well, but I'm not sure how well that was carried out, as I no longer was a PCV. While it sounds like a stepback, you'll always have your CELTA, which is, for good or ill, the most recognized TEFL certification.   If you just feel like teaching for a couple of years post-PC, there are countries that will take you based on your experience alone. They might run you through a brief training program, but that's about it.  As far as discounts, I don't really know any. You could see if you could get a group discount somewhere by signing up with the interested volunteers. Not sure if that will work though.  I hope this helps. Also, PM if you ever want to swap Peace Corps stories. I love hearing new ones. Most of my friends and I have told our stories a million times, so it's always nice to hear from someone new."
TEFL,3d81t3,rustyrockets,4,Tue Jul 14 06:08:23 2015 UTC,Brazilian passport.   This is the sticking point. While there are positions for non native speaker advertised here and there. The pay is a lot lower. For going across the world to some sandbox for much lower pay? Not sure if worth it.
TEFL,3d81t3,Leetenghui,2,Tue Jul 14 09:11:35 2015 UTC,"Well, though this doesn't answer your question directly, my SO is a Brazilian with a Bachelor's Degree from a US university and perfectly accented US English, and she was able to get a TEFL job in Russia. So, it is possible to get a foreign TEFL job without the proper passport if you look outside of the biggest markets and have the proper certs (she has the CELTA).   One thing that might be worth considering is actually being a Portuguese teacher, or marketing yourself as someone who could teach English mostly, but also give the school the opportunity to offer Portuguese lessons. That is definitely something she did, and she actually did get a few Portuguese students despite us being in a provincial Russian town with less than a million people. I'd imagine there is a market in countries that traditionally have immigrated to Brazil like maybe Lebanon if you're ok with that level of danger, or in big metropolises like Istanbul.   Like others have said, the best strategy is to just get your resume out there and try to get some responses. The countries with strict passport requirements for visas are obviously out of the question, but I'm sure there's a school out there that would be happy to have you."

TEFL,3d81t3,DavidOfBrooklyn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:25:15 2015 UTC,"The biggest problem your gonna have regarding teaching anywhere is the Brazilian passport. I've never taught in the middle east but here in Thailand and when I taught in indonesia, every school wanted and checked that my passport was from an English speaking country, such as the U.S, Canada, UK, Australia etc. And from what I read middle eastern countries have more strict standards than south east asia.  There are exceptions though, if you grew up in the U.S or any other english speaking country and can speak English perfectly some schools may hire you. But it's unlikely gonna be in the middle east."
TEFL,3d81t3,endhalf,2,Tue Jul 14 08:25:26 2015 UTC,"The schools tend to check the passports usually due to law restrictions. I'm not sure about Thai but in certain countries (like South Korea), people with passports other than the big seven (US, UK, Ireland, Aus, NZ, Canada, South Africa) can't legally teach English (they just don't get the visa). AFAIK, there are many more qualified non-natives (since they have to study specifically teaching English in order to teach, unlike people, who come to China with a degree in anything just to pay off their loans) but a law is a law. Technically, if someone emigrates and obtains US passport, he/she is likely to be accepted even if originally non-native (meaning that the schools generally just don't care).   Just to clarify, I'm not arguing or anything, just sheding some light on why some schools are so adamant about the passport thing. At the same time, I'm sure there are schools that truly want great teachers but then again, there are many great non-native English teachers as well."
TEFL,3d81t3,Nozka,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:25:34 2015 UTC,Yeah I understand its not the schools requirement its for the visa. Here is Thailand there are a lot of Filipino teachers who work illegally for low wage.

TEFL,3d81t3,Nozka,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:06:44 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm in the same boat you are. I'm a non-native speaker with the difference that I'm focusing on teaching English even with my BA. Now, I'm starting my MA in English Teaching and I plan on getting a Celta too. So, there are two things we can actually do. Either we can moan about not being able to get a job overseas even though we are qualified or we can look at the countries where they want us.  I love Asia and I plan on living there so my info will be a bit different from what you're looking for but one thing I noticed is that as soon as you get a PhD, some countries are a lot less strict with their visas. Might be worth considering. I know it's a huge thing to do but hey, you can do PhD in a country where you want to be and work while you're doing a PhD (usually, you can do part-time work on a long-term student visa).   When I was looking at the middle eastern job market, I found out that they are heavily discriminating against non-natives even if the laws don't forbid non-natives from gaining a work visa. Either people won't employ you or they'll offer you pretty shitty salary. I'm quite sure though that with your language ability (I mean of Arabic, I can't judge your English though I have no reason to suspect you of having poor English abilities), you'll be able to find job even without the PhD. Why not try to save up 1000-2000 bucks and come to the country of your choice, looking for work? One thing that I've read a study about is that people in the ME are focusing on accent A LOT so if you have a heavy accent, you might want to work on that. Slight accent should be fine though it'll often mean that if they are on a tipping point, it'll reduce your chances of being hired.  Other than that, there's not much you can do, I'm afraid, other than actually emigrating to one of the big 7 countries, obtaining their passport and then passing yourself as a native immigrant that has accent entirely due to his parents. Some countries will not want you. Acknowledge their backward thinking and go somewhere else. I'm sure there'll be other countries that'll be happy to have an extra qualified English teacher.    Edit: Actually, you're a bit better off. One HUGE advantage you have is that your native language is a desirable one and so you can actually teach Spanish Portugese too. Just a suggestion but I know a Spanish guy, who fell in love with a Latvian girl I knew and he's now in Latvia, teaching Spanish. Latvia... I'm pretty sure you can teach Portugese even in ME, though I bet the demand will be lower than in Europe."
TEFL,3d81t3,endhalf,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:34:44 2015 UTC,Arriving in the ME and looking for work is a very bad idea for many reasons. And since when is Brazil a Spanish speaking country?

As I've said, I'm not particularly interested in ME so things that apply to Asia might not apply to ME, but just saying ""that isn't a good idea"" won't say much to OP ;)."
TEFL,3d81t3,MySOMadeMyAccount,2,Tue Jul 14 18:25:49 2015 UTC,"You're right, I should elaborate. It's a bad idea firstly because the hiring process is long and complicated; generally people are hired in the Spring for jobs that begin in September. The hiring process can also involve the attestation of degrees and obtaining other documents that need to be taken care of in one's own country.  There's also no real advantage of just showing up at schools/universities and asking for a job. They'll want to look at your CV first anyway. In most ME countries there is very little in the way of budget accommodation or public transport which means 1-2k will not get you very far. Also it may be difficult for the OP to get a tourist visa to most ME countries. Finally, ME employment packages almost always include airfare which makes flying there on your own dime an unnecessary expense."
TEFL,3d6tdr,cashtangoteam,6,Mon Jul 13 23:46:02 2015 UTC,"So what I'm getting from this thread is that people in TEFL can just fraud a certificate by designing their own and that's accepted?

TEFL,3d6tdr,Annaeus,5,Tue Jul 14 00:40:07 2015 UTC,"I did a quick, cheap online tefl course through learnTEFL. It was maybe $70 or so, and it head sufficient information on theory, lesson planning, grammar, etc. I have prior teaching and tutoring experience, so I didn't feel that I needed an extensive online class.   However, I did fork out some cash -  $400 - for a separate 20 hour in-class tefl course through i-to-i. This one included observed teaching practice, and I found it to be really helpful and worth the money. It only took one weekend of my time, so it works for people with a full work schedule. I didn't have anything available in my city, so that's why I opted for a shorter class over a weekend to accommodate traveling.   If you have the means, I would highly recommend investing in an in-person course that also includes teaching observation. This is what will be most beneficial to you, rather than a quick and dirty online class.   Just a note, because I see a lot of people complaining about how ""cheap"" some people are with tefl courses... I think some people forget that not everyone has hundreds of dollars at their disposal! While it may be easy for some of us not to bat an eye at dropping  $400 on a class, it may be out of reach for others. It's true that some people don't care about the quality of their certificate or education and don't see that they will eventually have an impact on a child's education.

The learnTEFL class I took had a groupon available, so I only paid the $70 for it. However there was an additional charge (I think $20?) to receive a physical certificate. I would recommend it, but it's helpful if you download or copy and paste the information into a word document so you can reference it later. Sometimes there is material they cover or ideas for activities that can be helpful. You can't access the course after it expires, so just a heads up."

The laws are very generic even now for the 'education and cultural educator' category of the foreign expert work visa.   I have never done a TEFL course because they're a complete waste of time and money. They aren't regulated or accredited by any central body, and unless they're offered directly through a university or carry local weight they're just BS.

TEFL,3d73lk,ansoniK,-1,Tue Jul 14 04:44:38 2015 UTC,"I don't know where you heard otherwise, but you definitely need to get a tefl certificate in order to qualify for the working visa.   I don't think it's common to get the cert before you complete the course; but whatever gets you into the country, working, and the right visa in your passport.  Some tefl cert programs are self-paced, so you can get through them in about 2 weeks if you really want to. Look into i-to-i, LoveTEFL, or google any self-paced online TEFL certiciation course."

TEFL,3d40e8,Savolainen5,6,Mon Jul 13 10:03:38 2015 UTC,"What was your overall experience? Would you work there again? Would you recommend it to someone else?   It's a bit strange that these questions are all in the past tense, as I'm still here, so keep that in mind. I've had a great experience so far in Indonesia - I truly love living and teaching here. I plan on teaching elsewhere in a few years for some variety, but will likely come back as my heart is here. I'd recommend teaching here with the caveat that it is difficult to get a legit job with a proper visa and that some people just don't take to the challenges of living in a developing country.   What did you like? What did you not like?   It's hard to tell whether this is asking about the overall experience or living and teaching here, or specifically about the work experience. If speaking generally, I love the food, culture, incredibly friendly people, and casual work environment. I dislike the bureaucracy and the feeling that sometimes, working in expensive language schools, you're not teaching the kids who could truly benefit the most from this education.   Where did you work? City or region, what kind of school?   For three years I've worked in Bandung, West Java, at a small (one location) language school. I love Bandung, and others seem to as well, as it's got a cooler climate, beautiful surroundings, and the great Sundanese culture.   What were your students like? Age, attitude?   I've taught students from as young as 7 up to middle aged folks. I'd say most of my students though are teenagers or college students, as I generally teach Intermediate-Advanced English, conversation and TOEFL/IELTS prep classes. The youngin's can be a spoiled handful, but that's likely true anywhere in the world. I love working with university students, finding them dedicated, polite, and eager to learn.    What were your co-workers and bosses like? I get along well with my co-workers, local and foreign. The local teachers were very helpful when I first arrived, sharing lesson plans and advice when I was just finding my feet. My DoS for most of this time has been another Californian, amazingly - we get on fantastically. I've never heard of any students in other schools here dealing with tyrannical bosses or incompetent owners, either - doesn't seem as big as a problem as it is in other Asian countries (coughChinacough.)  What is the teaching culture like?   Public education is a disaster, with most kids receiving their education in a non-communicative style from teachers who often barely speak English. Teachers working at language schools in the private sector often have the task of making up for that. Depending on the school, the teaching environment can be quite serious and professional. Some schools put a lot into teacher development and workshopping while others do not. Mine doesn't do much of that but I'm a lazy complacent motherfucker so that doesn't bother me all that much.   How did you get hired? Was that typical of this country?   I asked around on forums until a Bandung teacher took pity on me and recommended that I take his place in the school he was working at. E-mailed the DoS and quite easily got the job (was it cause we're both Californians and alumni of the same university? Maaaybe...) Not sure how typical this is - a lot of teachers seem to end up here after seeing an ad on sites like Dave's, not after specifically choosing this country and hunting down language courses like I did.   What was your pay? How did it compare to living expenses?   My pay is low by international standards but more than enough to live comfortably. One could easily save half of one's salary each month. Standard salaries are anywhere from 9-13 million rupiah starting off. Housing is rarely included in contracts, but you can rent a very decent house for a year (you pay in a yearly lump, strangely) for 10-20 million rupiah. After getting that out of the way, the only expenses are food (I eat out for almost every delicious meal), credits for phone, internet, and electricity, and paying for a pembantu (like a maid/housekeeper, pretty standard round here.) I wouldn't come here to save big bucks like you can in other countries, but you can live very, very well if you're not obsessed with being frugal and saving every penny.   What are some good websites where one can find useful information about TEFL in this country?   Honestly, I didn't find any great sites while looking for the job three years ago, and haven't checked out the offerings since then.   Anything else a prospective TEFL would need to know about this country? Life pro tips for this country?   Within the few years I've been here, it has become increasingly harder for teachers, qualified or otherwise, to get a proper KITAS, or work visa. Almost all teachers I know are on technically sketchy business visas, which are not technically legal - they must claim to be ""consultants"" when coming through immigration, which is something of a loophole. This also means that these folks have to go on visa runs to Singapore every few months or so, which is not a huge deal for most people -if anything, it's like a little international holiday every once and a while.  Even for perfectly qualified teachers (and the list of official qualifications required by the government continues to grow - right now I think you are required to be over 25, have some form of TEFL certification and a degree ""related to English"", and I believe you must have five years of experience) it is difficult to get a legit KITAS. Even after I'd had a KITAS for three years, my employer ran into issues renewing it this year, and it has been stuck in bureaucracy limbo for nearly six months. During this time I've been unable to legally work full time, shuffling in and out of the country every few months on tourist and other short term visas waiting for my KITAS to be approved. This experience isn't typical but just thought I'd mention it as dealing with bureaucracy and sketchy visas situations is definitely a part of teaching here.  As for pro tips, if any people are interested in teaching here and have specific questions, I'd be happy to answer those."

TEFL,3d40e8,lapzod,3,Tue Jul 14 03:47:13 2015 UTC,"I spent 3.5 years teaching in Jakarta, so here are my answers.   What was your overall experience? Would you work there again? Would you recommend it to someone else?   Overall it was good. Good but hard. For me I went from Australia to Indonesia and had to overcome a lot of struggles relating to the different life styles. As for would I work their again? I would, if I had a different company to work for.   What did you like? What did you not like?   What did I like? For teaching, the fact that I got to experience teaching different ages and capabilities, that meant every day was challenging. Also being a white guy meant that in some cases it was easy to get along with the students. Outside of work, the culture is amazing. It's so different, but the same. And the food is amazing. My one complaint is that you do get tired of being stared at by people as you walk down the street. What I hated most of all, was that for the type of school I worked at, it's acceptable to jerk the white teachers around. When I first signed my contract, the working hours were between 9am-9pm, but I would be working from 1pm-8pm in most cases with no weekends. Then as I was white, I gt sent out to a junior high school in the mornings, and teach at the center in the afternoons, so it was 7am-4pm/7:30pm days. Occasionally I wouldn't even go in to my center because I was sent around, which I hated because it left me feeling used and unattached to anywhere.   Where did you work? City or region, what kind of school?   I worked in Jakarta, in the South for a language mill, were we did after class courses for all ages. From 4 until 40. Although just before I left, they changed it to university students. I was also outsourced to a Junior High, which was a lot of fun (except for the start times!)   What were your students like? Age, attitude?   Young students (4 years old) were a handful, like young people tend to be. Once they get to around the 9 year old point, the start to calm down a bit. A lot haven't had a lot of contact with white foreigners, so they seemed to be charmed by that which made them listen a bit. Of course you do get the student who doesn't care/doesn't want to be there. University students were fun, because they wanted to know about outside Indonesia, and what it's like.   What were your co-workers and bosses like?   My co-workers were nice people. Even though I've been gone for 6 months now, I still keep in touch with them, and visit whenever I go back to Jakarta. I worked with women mainly, but they were always friendly. My boss? She was terrible. Would never listen, or would listen and do the opposite. She once forgot to renew my visa, so I had to postpone my trip back to Australia (which put me out of pocket)   What is the teaching culture like?   It completely depends on the school. I worked at several Junior High's who were using English books full of grammar issues and the like, but the teachers were all dedicated, and tried their best to teach. The way they spoke English was the same as the books. I worked at a very high ranking school, and they were amazing. They looked after their students as if they were their own children, helped them day to day. At the end of the year the students host an event, which is organised by themselves (with a little help from the teachers) but the teachers stand back and only step in when they need to. It was amazing thing to see.   How did you get hired? Was that typical of this country?   The owner's wife was my wife's aunt's friend. Confused? They generally post on Dave's, or a few other ESL boards. Or you can go directly to the webpage and then the head office chooses where the teachers are needed.   **What was your pay? How did it compare to living expenses?   Pay was not good. You start off at 7million, which is quite low, but if you're not at an International School, it's about standard. Housing you're looking at a dorm like setup. One room, with a bathroom and AC is anywhere from 1.5million. By my 3rd year, my pay was closer to 9.5 million. Can you save? Sure, if you don't really go out or not go out often. it does get easier as you get paid more though.   **  What are some good websites where one can find useful information about TEFL in this country?**   Dave's. it has a really good forum on Indonesia   Life pro tips for this country?   Eat everything. The food is amazing. And as soon as you leave, you'll miss the spices!"

I live in Thailand and work six days a week, by choice, because I like money and actually can make like 2k USD a month teaching here. To me it's worth it. Plus I still get paid vacation in between terms, and a solid bonus too. However yea, I do work two jobs six days a week, so usually I am busy working.   Some people here make less than 1,000 USD a month in the provinces but they spend 500 bucks a month and then have plenty of time off to travel with their savings.   Up to you, but overall Thailand is not the best place to save money for traveling, however traveling in Thailand is really cheap and it's a great hub for flights."

For the record, I don't say this because I regret it... far from it! I just happen to be going through this stage in my life the opposite direction.  Do you really, really hate engineering? TEFL wages are largely stagnating/falling in most of Korea/Japan, especially for newbies, and the crap exchange rates don't help the situation. But getting a non-teaching job in Japan will undoubtedly require near-fluent Japanese. You might consider coming here and teaching for a year or so while studying the language harder and looking for engineering gigs (however... the job market for teaching with no qualifications is beyond saturated). You'll also get that change of pace that you crave.  Dunno what kind of engineering you do, but I recall teaching a few Japanese Bosch employees in a beautiful rural town during my first year there. They mentioned working with quite a few foreigners, but there's a chance they might have been transferred from their home countries rather than hired in Japan. Might look into this more?  Also, what do you mean by ""by the book"" ways of doing.. what exactly? Societal rules in Japan are ridiculously strict, Korea slightly less so, China no real idea. As for how that applies to your work life, expect to work loooong days, have dozens of pointless meetings you may/may not understand, and never be allowed to leave before the boss does. If you mean coming over illegally, then you can expect to be fucked over by unscrupulous employers. It's very common.  Lastly.... these 3 languages have very, very little in common, particularly Chinese compared with Japanese and Korean. The kanji from Chinese is merely borrowed by J+K over 1000s of years.

TEFL,3d2n8u,DoilyTrouble,-1,Mon Jul 13 05:33:04 2015 UTC,"Your salary might be stagnant... But maybe you're sending money home? I don't have a wife or kids or family that I'd be sending money home to. I'm pretty much a college graduate with a backpack. As far as engineering and your life direction... I'll say this. If you think your salary is stagnant in education and that it's largely based on qualifications and performance, it's much worse in engineering. For the most part, you better know what they are looking for, word for word or you won't even get a call back. An engineering degree is for the most part a collection of a wide range of subjects that involve hand derived solutions like fluid mechanics, thermodynamics and heat transfer. We do a SMALL amount of computer based mechanics, such as AutoCAD and SolidWorks, but it's nowhere near the capacity a full time firm is looking for. What most employers are looking for is a year of solid experience specifically in the field they operate in, so they might be looking for a year of designing braking systems using AutoDesk with FEMAP applied to the materials to analyze failure and fractures. Unless you SPECIFICALLY did that as an intern for your undergraduate, you're shit out of luck. And it gets a lot worse, the closer you get to more populated cities with more desirable companies. You want to work for Tesla? Nissan? So does every other mechanical engineering graduate... Including the ones from Harvard, MIT, Stanford, Princeton, Cal Tech... And those schools put out a LOT more engineers than Tesla is hiring. So Tesla can afford to make requirements like, ""2~3 years of experience in failure analysis and Siemens Femap, 2 years of design and testing automotive components, 3 years of designing vehicle interface UI"" plus asking for a master's degree at minimum. Here's where it gets even worse than that though... You might be thinking, well if they can't find someone that qualified (and they don't), why don't they hire someone with less qualifications and train them? Well, that's because financially it doesn't make sense for them to do that. They're looking for the perfectly experienced engineer to compliment their team of 3 or 4 engineers that are being worked to the bone (45-60 hours per week). But if they can't find that engineer, they'd rather just dump their money into OT for the trained engineers they have because that would be cheaper than hiring an engineer and training him. I knew a guy who had a connection with Nvidia. He was a computer engineering major, had six months of experience working with PLC and circuit design, had solid references and an engineer IN-HOUSE vouching for him. The guy at Nvidia just couldn't get his managers to hire him... So Nvidia guy is working 60-65 hours a week and my buddy is still rounding his resume out. Yeah, engineering was a hard ass degree... But the job opportunities people talk about are like ""sanctuary"" in a zombie apocalypse. Everyone talks about it, but we can't seem to be finding those jobs. The thing about teaching is you can only do so much OT before you have no choice but to hire more teachers. One teacher can't teach four classes at the same time... But an engineer absolutely can juggle four projects at the same time because at the end of the day, a ""healthy"" work schedule for an engineer is along the same lines as... ""sanctuary"" in a zombie apocalypse. Oh just one more project and you'll get some time off."

If you wait until you get a job to start doing this ""experiential learning"" then both your next job and the possibility of learning this way will be greatly harmed.

Every engineering position I find overseas, they're looking for two years of experience, three years of experience, etc... Or it's a completely unrelated engineering discipline like electrical or computer. The jobs you're thinking of, those people aren't in a rush to hire fresh graduates. They're looking for extremely qualified people... And I have no idea how they expect to get those people anyway. Most people with 2 or 3 years of experience aren't trying to drop everything and relocate to Asia. Don't get me wrong, I'd love to take an overseas job in engineering but I feel like if I want to switch to software development, I need a year of independently published applications on iTunes before a studio will even take a chance with me."

Basically I wanted to be liked and was much too slow to ask for help. This actually made the school suspicious of me and caused some little problems.   This is usually my main advice. Ask about how they deal with problems and use their system.   Apart from that, it will take time to develop your own way of doing things but this is a good base to work from.

TEFL,3cyya6,Teamonsterggg,5,Sun Jul 12 02:38:35 2015 UTC,"I dont feel totally natural now but you get used to it.  Actually the turning point for me was discovering this website http://genkienglish.net/ and in turn reading about TPR (Total Physical Response). This in turn got me interested in reading around a bit more and applying what I had read. Focusing more on the students as oppose to yourself is a good way to go. If you put a bit of thought and care into each then youll start to see things from their point of view.  I think some people do have a natural way with kids but mostly it needs to be worked at. Theyre usually very friendly and fun, which means you can focus on running your class. Classes when Im not talking much but organising things from the side are usually better.   With the other thing, basically I got myself very stressed out on some days and was generally quite stressed for a while. The school didnt believe that I wasnt having ANY problems with students (amd they were right, just tolerating) so they encouraged me to use them a bit more for it. I did and it got a bit less stressful. Thats about it really. A matter of my own maturity more than anything."
TEFL,3cyya6,girlhassocks,7,Sun Jul 12 02:54:09 2015 UTC,"Hi.  When I first taught in Korea (2008), I didn't expect to find myself scared and petrified in front of a small group of young children.  The truth is nothing will really prepare you, because Korean children see you differently then the other adult figures in their life. Plus whatever experience they have had with a foreigner, they are going to expect that from you.  So if you come in after a teacher that was VERY FUN and handed out candy a lot, they will behave the way kids do when that doesn't happen to them.  With all that said, it's not impossible. In fact, I learned how to teach children after about 3 yrs into it in Korea. You eventually learn to be firm, yet kind and funny.  You need to think of class management systems that establish you as someone who cares about all of them and shows you care about the experience they are having. Bottom line is most children in Korea, have many teachers due to their hard academic life. You're going to need to be tough and pull through the bad times, and good.   I would also add that you have to realize that you're going to be more than their teacher. Because of these children's busy lives, and the busy lives of their parents you're going to have to be there to help them through a lot of behavioral issues. I managed to get close to many of my students by stepping aside and helping them through whatever it is they are going through.  I dunno if this is helpful. But you gotta know some truths about it all. It is going to be rewarding and also hard. There will be ppl who say, ""hey just have fun"" and ""you don't need to plan anything"". But my teaching improved after I took a TEFL course and after I started to think more about the experiences students were having with me.   Anyway best of luck!"

I was in Spain, outside of Barcelona. I didn't speak THAT much Spanish at the time, but as young as these kids were, neither did they! They spoke Catalan. Let's just say it was not pretty. The kids were confused as to where their old teacher went, and my inexperience with children allowed them to walk all over me. It was horrible. I could never get control of the class, and teachers in adjacent classrooms would complain about the noise as I threw my hands up in despair. I just had to tough it out and try and get through it. By the end of the term, I had kind of gotten the hang of it, but I wouldn't say I was very successful.

Despite the fact that half my (Caucasian) coworkers were the ""native speaker who can barely speak his own language let alone attempt to teach it"" types, I constantly got overlooked and not taken seriously for being Asian in Asia. I'm not even kidding, someone thought one of my coworkers had a legitimate learning disability because his English was unbelievably bad--on many occasions I thought his writing was the product of our very low-level students! Despite this, I was constantly overlooked and treated like a second-class citizen to coworkers whose literally only qualifications were being a white native speaker, and graduating from some boonies college with a 99% admittance rate. It never happened to me, but I heard horror stories of Asian Americans who tried to teach a class, but had the all the students walk out on them because they were expecting a white face for the money they paid. Maybe it isn't as bad in more progressive countries, but there will always be an undercurrent of Caucasian superiority in TEFL. Depends on the institution though, and what type of job you're getting..   It comes down to pays for the TEFL/ESL classes--in many cases, parents who want the prestige of having a white face and could never take someone of their own race seriously (despite that person being insanely more qualified). Again, in a non-white country, if you aren't white, people automatically assume you're not as qualified to teach English--unbelievably stupid, but what can you do.   I have no real advice for teaching English in Eastern Europe, but I do think citizenship may be a slight issue--I believe EU citizenship is generally preferred in Europe/the UK right? Plus, it may be easier saying you were Indian-American with English as your first language, as opposed to someone completely born and raised outside the EU/English speaking country. Not that it's by any means impossible--I had quite a few coworkers from other countries.   Edit: tl;dr can't offer too much advice about eastern europe, but it is a bit harder when you're not white, not a native speaker, and don't have citizenship in an English speaking country. That being said, there will always be teaching jobs in Asia, and so long as you can prove your abilities, you shouldn't have much of a problem.. Once you get your foot in the door you'll be fine.

It's not the typical setup for E-2 visa teachers, so keep that in mind.  Since your question focuses on money, I'll do that first.  Income: Looks like your job would be 9,000-10,000 RMB / month, or $1450 - $1600 / month for working 32 hours a week. I work at a private school here for 20 hours a week and make 2.3 million won, or about $2000. Then with my extra time, I do private classes for 35,000 - 40,000 won an hour (illegal but w/e). It varies, but I'd guess it averages 24 hours a week and $2300 a month. I could work more and make more, but I've found a good balance for the time being.  Expenses: Rent: $400 / month  Bills: $70 / month  Phone: $80 / month  Insurance: $90 / month  Buses/Subway: $60 / month  Totals about $700 / month. The rest is spent on food/entertainment or saved. I save about $1000 a month. If I worked in China for 10,000 RMB / month in a big city like Nanjing, I don't think I could save as much. With side jobs though, I imagine it wouldn't be too hard.  Jobs: If you have your documents ready, especially your FBI background check, you can search for academy jobs starting next week if you wanted. There is more competition these days because of public school cutbacks, but it's not that hard. Helps if you're a young white female (I'm a youngish white male).  All that said, I've been here for a while. Unless you have specific ties to Korean culture, I would suggest China these days as it's growing there. In Korea, it's going in the wrong direction. Cutbacks, more competition, stagnant wages, increasing prices, etc. There's nothing wrong with coming here to teach, but China seems to be the future."

Having said that, I taught in both China and Korea (China for one year, Korea for two), and I can say that without a doubt, I had a much much better experience in Korea. Not to say that my experience in China was bad (far from it), but I was able to save so much more, and therefore, experience so much more in Korea (salary was ~$2,200 a month in Korea, and I often saved $500-1000 a month). Because of various benefits (e.g. refund of pension, exit allowance) I also left Korea with an absurd amount of money that I was able to travel and live on, as well as invest with, up until now (almost a year later). I'll be the first to admit that there were many subjective factors that made my life better in Korea as well (amazing students, school, co-teachers, friends, etc.), but I just had a much more comfortable life/lifestyle overall in Korea.  A lot of my friends taught at private academies. The benefits can vary, but are often similar to public school jobs. Many of my friends didn't have many problems with their academies. By far their biggest complaint was not having enough vacation time. But I also had friends at private academies who had much more vacation time than I did. I would say that if you're going to look at a private academy (called ""hagwon/s"", btw), do your research so you don't pick a crappy one."

TEFL,3cu9sf,RobotRock0101,2,Tue Jul 14 22:13:11 2015 UTC,"I've taught in both SK and China. Korea is the better option by far. The quality of life in China is really low compared to Korea. I lived in Seoul, saved tons of money and was able to enjoy myself every weekend.   China has so many problems including food safety, pollution and the lack of real protection for foreigners.   If you have the option and don't have some prior love for or interest in China, go to Korea."
TEFL,3cu9sf,KatDev,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:42:03 2015 UTC,"Couldnt disagree more with this and ive also worked in both. More money in korea, but thats the only advantage.   Quality of life? What types of things are you thinking about? Maybe we just have different expectaions of western life, but my quality of life was always good. Money was better in korea but in china its possible to travel and enjoy yourself every weekend. If you couldnt do that in china you were doing it wrong. Food safety? Never had a problem in either country, but I guess its possible. Real lack of protections for foreigners? Care to expand? Never had any problem nor do I know of anyone who did. Sounds a bit sensitive.   You could justify prefering either country, but you chose some odd examples...then again, different strokes for different folks. If you want to make money in seoul, fair play. I just find that a bit bland and generic.  Both can be fun...question to me comes to money. Need money, go to korea. Otherwise china. But really youll have fun wherever you go."
TEFL,3cu9sf,AGoodMan-AndThorough,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:37:01 2015 UTC,"Which city did you live in? I should have mentioned that I lived in Hangzhou and not somewhere like Shanghai. I'd imagine that people living in Shanghai would have a more positive experience.   You think mentioning the pollution is odd? That hugely affected my quality of life because I couldn't easily work out outside. I'm pretty outdoorsy and having that taken away was a pretty big deal but you're right, different strokes for different folks.   I got seriously ill from the food twice (don't even want to think about that Chinese hospital) and was even warned by the company to not eat at restaurants during the summer because it was so common for the foreigners to get ill because the restaurants don't refrigerate the meat. I heard of lots of other people getting sick from the food. China is a big place so maybe where you are from the food quality is better and not just oily and bad quality.   I could have traveled and gone out every weekend in China if it was a financial consideration but I didn't do those things because I found the public transport incredibly frustrating and the social life very lacking. Again, living somewhere like Shanghai would definitely make these things different.   I know of plenty of people who had problems with their employers and were not able to seek help. I myself experienced threats from my employer and when I went to the agencies that are supposed to be there to protect you in theory, they did nothing. I find it hard to believe that you have never heard of a foreigner being screwed by their school in China. In Korea, any problems that I had were resolved in a normal, above-board way.   I'll be blunt here, quality of life for me is having a good social circle and being able to enjoy my hobbies (cycling, hiking). Good quality of life for me does not include having to see people take a shit on the side of the street twice a week, having to hand my passport over for every tiny little thing, being lied to by my boss and being told 'it's not a lie in China' and having to listen to expats who had been there for 7+ years tell me that grey stuff floating in the sky and covering everything in dirt is not pollution.  I actually saved more money in China than Korea but it wasn't worth it."

Sure you hear about it, but so rare I never gave it a second thought. Preferred chinese food to korean. Preferred the architecture and even the people in china. Preferred the quality of life and ability to travel.   Different tastes, no worries. Id go back to parts of china, but dont think id ever go back to korea, even for the money."

Find some universities in Nanjing they pay about the same (6-7000 rmb) except you do only 16 teaching hours and no office hours. Then find some part time jobs, and you'll be able to save much more money. Or find a training centre. You should get at least 10K RMB a month and housing  WIth your current job you'll probably spend 4500-6000rmb a month (including apartment). So you won't save much.

You could probably get 10k for that many hours or 16 hours for the same wage.  Regardless it depends how you live, If you care about money I'd advise Korea.  I don't know why people say China is cheap, electronics are the same price, petrol is not that much cheaper.  Travel within china is cheapish but not ""dirt cheap"", if you want to travel outside of china your plane tickets are still going to be the same price.  Food is cheaper so long as you don't eat out anywhere remotely nice and foreign food is twice the price than it is back home.    I'd advise people who are intention saving money not to do TEFL at all but if they do and they are set on eastern asia, then South Korea it is.  Personally I preferred the China to Korea, it's all about the balance really - what is more important.  As for defaulting on your contract I wouldn't worry about it, they can technically get you a five year ban on coming into China but as you are still outside the country?  The immigration office are very unlikely to do anything even if the school did complain which they probably won't.  Just make up an excuse."

If you were in barca you only had one of the Spanish experiences... there's more than just madrid and barca to consider.  why not try Galicia or one of the other northern regions. Santander is beauuuutiful and has a completely different feel and people to catalonia. Have friends doing really well in up that way. As far as I can tell the crisis has been less severe in the north so more ops.  Alternatively look and see if you could do something in Extremadura - ridiculously overlooked by most foreigner and crazy gorgeous, especially in spring. Think stunted Holm oaks, black piggies and purple flowers under a blueeeee sky filled with big scary bird types names of which which escape me right now. Also Portugal is on your door step... cheap and wonderful and fills the different experience criteria. If you wanted to do city I'd look at Cáceres and merida. Gonna guess your qualifications might go further as they're less popular and that you could supplement with private under the table stuff for the same reason.  Great thing with spain is with the nie gotten you're good to go from day one and that the private classes market is massive; though not possibly as visible initially. Look at lingo bongo .com. decid your minimum salary, get it and go. It'll grow over the year as you augment with privates in the waves in sept/Oct,  Jan, Feb and easter. (Resolution periods: I must improve my english) catch a good wave and you'll easily double it.

TEFL,3cvpn3,iansarrad,2,Sat Jul 11 05:51:53 2015 UTC,Often with German students you will get an asshole who insists you are wrong or that their school teacher taught them the opposite 30 years ago. With Germans at least the best approach is to be extremely firm and point out that you are the native speaker and the teacher and that you know what you are doing and they do not. You need to really assert your expertise. With the germans at least this created a lot of really positive feedback for me. As for your speaking- slow is fine if it is natural and as long as you don't simplify the natural features of the language out all of the time.

I don't think you meant this to be so blunt, but for example, If a teacher just stands up at the front of the room and says: ""I am the native speaker, so everything I say is correct"" (or some version of that), they are doing a great disservice to their students and other teachers.   Language learning should be a dialogic and discursive process whereby students not only learn a practical skill but also gain some greater insight about the nature of culture and language, following a humanistic education.   Stephanie Ann Houghton, Damian Rivers, Suresh Canagarajah, Alastair Pennycook and a few others have put out some seminal works regarding the native speaker fallacy that are really worth while."

TEFL,3csjw8,NO_thisispatrick_,4,Fri Jul 10 12:47:29 2015 UTC,I would suggest doing an MA in France.  Even as a US citizen most MAs there are practically free.  Once you finish the MA you can apply for citizenship (the residency requirement is shortened from five to two years for people that have completed an advanced degree in France) and should have a French passport within a year.  At that point you can go anywhere you want in the EU as a French citizen.   As to what particular MA to do I would say applied linguistics. It works for you whether you end up teaching English or French or both as well as some linguistics courses.

Really consider it as a major.  If it wasn't just one professor that put you off the subject and you really hate the field then I would suggest something like French or English literature.  The problem is those types of majors do little to teach you about how language actually works and focus more on critiquing literature which can't take you very far without a PhD.  I would say that linguistics is the best major for anyone planning on teaching a language course and it doesn't matter which language.  If a person that is fluent in English and French is teaching French classes but then decides to teach English classes that is no problem with a linguistics MA but with a Lit MA it could be a lot more difficult."

While UK starting salary (London) is 28K outside London it is quite a bit less. Most teachers also end up in the wild for a few years teaching cover and supply work meaning once you get a decent reputation they might consider you for a 0.8 position or just an hourly contract.  Secondly a whole load of UK teachers have MEd or MA ontop of their PGCE. The PGCE often has additional modules and or assignments you can do. This can reduce the work requirements for an MA/MEd by 50%. Therefore visa AND qualifications you're going to have a hard time.

Similarly, some countries have agreements with countries like Canada/Australia/New Zealand where their citizens can work there without a work visa, which makes them much easier to employ than Americans."
TEFL,3cr8qz,NeedsMoreBatman,4,Fri Jul 10 03:17:19 2015 UTC,"This is somewhat true, but it depends what rung of the TEFL ladder you're looking at: If you want to teach in training centers you will be discriminated against, but universities are different.  My friend is Chinese-American and he had no difficulty getting hired by a Chinese university. It helps that he's also well-qualified (CELTA, MA, experienced), but you should know that ethnicity is not a dealbreaker for Chinese universities.  Another friend is Chinese-English and works both in universities and international high schools.   Moreover, being Asian-American can be an advantage: Knowing L1 has helped them land beginner tutoring clients."
TEFL,3cr8qz,iansarrad,2,Fri Jul 10 06:48:53 2015 UTC,"I can confirm this. I worked at a good (Projects 211/985) university. The English language teaching staff included (Chinese) South Africans, Singaporeans, Chinese Americans and both white and black Africans (I know Africa is not a country but the actual country would be a giveaway).  I think it's partly a class & education thing. People making hiring decisions in university are more likely to have encountered value systems that have respect for minorities.  EDIT: However, both overseas Chinese and black African friends could not break into private language schools or high schools. One overseas Chinese wondered why: he showed me his CV and it had his photo and his Chinese name at the top! I told him to put his (non-Chinese) nationality at the top of the CV etc., but he still got nowhere."

Although I'd imagine Blacks were above asians because most tefl positions are basically ""look at us we have a foreign teacher"" and the more foreign looking the better.  The more professional institutions won't have as much stigma against non whites but being white will definitely influence your chances by a decent margin, if there were two candidates of the same quality they'd go for the white.  I don't agree with it but that's the way China unfortunately anyone who hasn't had to deal with this is extremely lucky.  China is a country where you can go into teaching and earn twice as much as a Chinese English teacher with a good grasp of English and good accent with zero experience yourself.  It's not a fair country unless you are white and this is coming from a white dude."

The Chinese government's policy has changed this year or else they're just more strictly enforcing it. The government itself is requiring a foreign experts certificate which shows you have at least two years experience in the educational field. I had a friend who applied for and obtained a work visa last year with absolutely no educational teaching experience. Just this past June, when I applied with one year's experience I was denied a foreign expert cert and thus a z visa. I was told that if I keep working at a school for another year, I could most likely get the foreign expert cert and a z visa. And this was at a school that's got really good guanxi (relationship) with the local visa office.   This new policy is making is much harder for schools to find English teachers and I believe there will most likely be a rise in desperate schools asking their teachers to come over and work on a tourist visa, which is shady and not very cost friendly in the long run."

Start-up costs were killer, though. I came out of the year with less money than I went in with, simply because of all the little necessary purchases at the start. Towels? Check. Silverware? Check. Vacuum cleaner? Check. Toaster oven (there was no real oven)? Check.  After we got the ball rolling, though, it was do-able.

I imagine you will be in a school or two, right? It's fairly likely that at least one teacher will be keen for you to tutor their kids. 10-15 euros per hour seems to be the going rate. Throw a few flyers up at the nearest uni and you will likely have some success (and probably instant social circles).  Food tends to be cheap, as does drink. If you get yourself registered as a resident, your resident's card will probably reduce the price of public transport.  I don't recall there being anything in the way of taxes, really, but that might have been a part of my contract (this is 2007-2008 so memory is fuzzy.)  It really depends on how old you are and what you want to do. I was 19-20 and walking, reading, skating and the occasional booze-up were about the extent of my worries. The money was fine for that. If you want to travel, you will find it more expensive.  There was always a room somewhere available for under 300 euros per month, I think I was paying in the region of 230-250 all in (again, this is somewhat outdated.)  Have a look online.

Basically, all you have to do in order to do the in-class portion of the program is work with a teacher in your selected subject with a teaching license. Their teaching license could be from another country.  It seems really easy to get this teaching certificate and it's only 9 months and 5000 dollars.  I don't work for them or anything, but it seems like if you want to get a teaching license abroad, it's the most accommodating program out there."

From the people I've talked to and the experiences I've had, I'd say Thailand, Vietnam, China, Japan, and Korea are all great places to teach. I don't have knowledge of many places outside Asia. And the great thing about TEFL is if you don't like where you live, you can just put in your notice and go to the next country.  I would say more important than which country you go to is where in the country you go. Just starting off, getting a job in a city that is well populated with other foreigners is ideal.

TEFL,3ck08d,Barnsalot,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:47:00 2015 UTC,"TEFL international is an accredited insitution. Don't take the full online class though. The half online class is okay because it gives you observed teaching hours in the classroom. That's the important part.  It's fairly common to move to the country you want to work in and find a job there in SE Asia. So if you wanted to go to Vietnam, you should sign up for a TEFL course in Ho Chi Minh city. Then while you are taking the course, you can start going around to schools and applying for jobs. For Japan and Korea you need to have a job lined up before hand."

After a year in Thailand I made enough to recuperate my expenses and pretty much broke even. I had a decent job in Shanghai teaching business English and saved about $15,000 in the first 18 months.  As a side note, I've heard that people can save a lot more working in Korea, but I wanted to pick up some Mandarin. So I chose China instead."

It sucks that I've lost about 33% of my salary within the last few months for no reason. That's why I'm leaving.  It's fine for my coworkers that spend all of their money in Malaysia, but for anyone sending money home, it is getting pretty bad.

TEFL,3cl8d0,betterworldbiker,2,Wed Jul 8 21:21:32 2015 UTC,"Its a bad time to invest in China. The biggest push will be on private investors having to scale back on investment. But it won't affect most day to day running and any impact won't be felt for the next few years at least.   The reason for this is a myriad of factors, notably the lack of foreign investors in China and the economic status of the people who have invested into the market. Because of this, the RMB can't really lose much value against other foreign currencies because foreign investors don't have as much capital invested into the market, so people aren't suddenly rushing to convert their Mao Money to US dollars or whatever. Another thing to note is that the Chinese economy is not hugely dependent on financial services as it is in places such as Hong Kong or the UK.   The market crashed because it was hugely inflated due to people over-speculating on investments and pushing the share prices up. Its very similar to the dotcom bubble. However this hardly killed the entirety of the internet business off and companies like Amazon and Google thrived out of that mess.  Its gonna be the same for China. What impact it has on the TEFL industry I really don't know. But if it helps run out smaller private investors with cash to burn then it might have the effect of cleaning up the industry by removing those mid-level investors from running money-mills such as illegal training centres."

Taking reasonable precautions (reading the news every couple days, keeping a US credit card activated in case I need to fly to thailand for an unplanned vacation.)

However the salary offers aren't going to be great anymore and it's a downhill game from here on in my opinion.  China, nor Eastern asia are countries where you are going to save a whole heap of money.  Unless you have never been employed before and saving $1000-2k USD is a big amount to you.  That's after years of experience also.    As for anti-foreign mobs, not something you need to put a lot of focus on.  My recommendation, if you really want to do it and you are young (22-24), you can afford to spend 2-3 years on doing it without it posing a huge risk to professional employment within your home country.

TEFL,3cjcip,KatDev,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:44:15 2015 UTC,"How many classes have you had? Usually the best thing to do is go in strong and then ease up but since you've already begun, you're fighting an uphill battle.   Do you have an assistant? You could make some rules and get the assistant to explain them and the consequences. With that age group, I find time outs out to pretty okay. So get a chair at the back of the room and put rule breakers in it.   If some kids don't want to take part in the activities, don't go ahead with the activity. Have something very basic and easy and boring to do instead. Then ask them if they want to do that or the fun thing. If they still refuse then make all the kids do the boring thing. After a minute, ask again. Keep going and eventually the social pressure will be too much for them.   Do you have appropriate activities for their level? Are you changing activities at least every 10 minutes? A lot of bad behaviour at this age comes from being bored.   I'm not a fan of giving sweets but if it's just a short term thing and it makes your life easier, go for it. Award and take away points (smiley faces next to the kids names) on the board and the winner at the end gets a sweet. Also, a good way to get them to stop talking with this system is to deduct points from the kid talking and the kid they are talking to. Another thing for the kids who don't want to take part is to threaten to take every student's points away if you count to 20 and they still aren't doing what you've asked.   The best advice I can give any teacher of kids: you are the adult in the room."

While my business and study-minded students will likely jump on any upcoming advancements in machine translation, Pablo will be unlikely to want to take advantage of that technology while trying to pick up a cute blonde girl in a crowded bar."

I always joke that he's the reason his mum is jobless, I know I'm a little bit distasteful :D.  The truth is I believe that English teaching is a downwards slope now but I don't think it's because of technology, technology actually benefits TEFL a lot more than it detracts from it.  I think the most important factor will be supply and demand, we are going to get to a stage where most foreigners who can afford English tuition already know the language or can teach it to their children.  So many young people in asia know much more than they did years ago and many who won't go outside the continent are either too poor and/or have no need for the language.  The amount of teachers keeps growing and the demand whilst great isn't keeping up with the supply, see excerpts of old job advertisements in 2005-2010 and check the salary/number of positions compared to now.    However... Technology won't completely replace a field like this for a loooooong time, I do believe translators are going to be getting it rough in the next decade or two because we really are not far away at all from that tech.  I'd be extremely surprised if it wasn't already in development."

Of course there will be a company out there that will try to pursue it. Computers are getting cheaper and cheaper, and in the future will be literally everywhere. We're quickly approaching a point where almost every human being on the planet will own a smartphone. Now imagine if that smartphone can translate in real time.  Computers are already learning to ""understand"" speech and language- think of IBM's Watson. I also remember watching a video about how in future search engines, computers will understand what you are looking for rather than just searching the internet for matching keywords that they don't understand. Can't find the link for the video.   Do I think all of this makes it worthless for people to go into tefl nowadays though? Certainly not- at least not anytime soon. Who knows what things will be like in 1-2 decades though. And for those of you bashing Kurzweil, a good amount of his predictions have either come out correct or close to correct: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictions_made_by_Ray_Kurzweil#Accuracy_of_predictions  I also disagree with people that think Moore's law is untrue or will stop. It's been performing as advertised since the term was coined. Yes, it is slowing down due to the limitations of silicon technology. But if you think Moore's law is going to be ""stopped"" by the limitations of silicon...well that's just foolish. Technology will adapt. They'll start creating new types of computers.  And if you think it's hard to take ""The Singularity"" seriously- well, then you're also not taking people like Bill Gates and Elon Musk seriously.

But I think that professions like ours will be one of the last to get engulfed by increasing levels of technology. Hell, maybe that's not a good thing. Everyone else will be sunbathing and painting because their jobs aren't necessary anymore and a utopia has been created... but teachers will still have to keep on keepin' on.  I'm a Kurzweilite myself, I love reading his work and tracking his predictions. As I said in another post, he can be a bit overly-convinced. But, ultimately, I'm optimistic, and hope that the things turn out as well as it seems they possibly could.  I'll agree with you regarding Moore's Law as well. Although we're reaching some technical parameters that are impassable with current technology, that's happened before, and what did we do? We came up with some new technology.

The man is practically a genius- and like I mentioned, there are many other smart people out there (Musk, Gates, etc) that take the singularity seriously. I'm not worrying about anything, I'm just pointing out that the concerns regarding a potential singularity (and general advances in technology) are legitimate, and not ""science fiction"". Just because I use the word ""seriously"" does not mean it's ""doom speak"". It doesn't mean I'm trying to ""warn"" you about something. Why are you assuming that?  And like I said in my comment, no, I don't think people in tefl need to reconfigure their lives for something that might happen in 20 years. The people that currently need to worry are the manual laborers and automobile drivers (as well as a variety of other professions that can be automated- which I won't bother citing).   And people still use horse carriages to get around. You know what I meant by the fax machine comment...  EDIT: and the logic of ""unless you work in these sectors..."" is ridiculous- are you saying that if I don't work in some sector, I'm automatically unknowledgeable about that sector? C'mon.

Languages are influenced by so many different (cultural) factors and they're constantly changing/evolving. Meanings shift, new words are created, old words fall out of use until they are eventually forgotten.  While I think it's possible that technology can impact TEFL/TESOL in certain areas such as Academic English and Business English, I think that the ability of a machine to grasp the nuance of a sarcastic joke, know when it is possible to flout one of Grice's maxiums, realize the pragmatic difference between the same utterance in two different contexts, are all reasons we'll have a job well into the future.   When we (humans) process an utterance, we're taking in so much information at the same time (who we're talking to, what we're talking about, the relationship between the speaker and the listener, whether or not it's appropriate to talk about certain topics at that time, the list goes on...) I feel it's hard to make sense of human to human conversation without thousands of years of evolution.  Anyway, that's my two cents."

TEFL,3cf19b,rogercoger,3,Wed Jul 8 01:14:35 2015 UTC,"Making money doing this requires you to know the right people and be in the right location. You also need to be, crucially, a good teacher and a good businessperson. You are essentially going to be operating a micro-business.    I will be completely honest with you here. At the moment I have four 1 to 1 private students. One girl pays me 700 yuan per week for two 2 hour classes. One man pays me 400 yuan per week for a single 2 hour class. One lady pays me 400 yuan for per week for two one hour classes and an extra 400 yuan to act as her English assistant, making phone calls to Pakistan and answering email on her behalf.   I teach two hours of kids classes on a Saturday for 200 yuan per hour. I was teaching a student at my university for the IELTS for 500 yuan per week for 3 hours of classes plus marked work.   On average I'm pulling in around 4000 yuan per week for 35 to 40 hours work, and saving approximately 80% of it, meaning each week I'm tucking away around 3400 yuan tax free. Right now I have 78,000 Yuan in my current account after being here for ten months, and having bought a new computer and an Ebike in this period. Initially It was difficult to find private students and I ended up teaching kids for 150 per hour on behalf of other University teachers. But once you get networked up and find a someone who can promote you online then the work really starts to come in.  This August I will be getting paid 2000 yuan per day to teach at an international school for a month, netting me 40,000 yuan for twenty days teaching. The parent company of the school is a big player in the educational consultancy market and if I do well I could end of teaching for then in Shanghai and they apparently pay 350 yuan per hour. Also, they are interested in hiring me as a intern over the winter break.   If you have good communication skills and are a people person then the work itself is quite interesting. However, you have to deal with a lot of attendant day to day bullshit: Risking life and limb getting to your teaching locations on your Ebike, chasing payments, keeping accounts, constantly exchanging wechat messages in order to organize times, students cancelling at the last minute, dealing with IT related problems and buying printer ink. It sometimes feels like you are always working.   So at the start of September, 12 months after arriving I anticipate having saved around 120,000 Yuan. Depending on how much further the Renminbi depreciates this will be worth about 12.5K in Pounds Sterling. I will also be able to hold a conversation on most topics in Chinese, read and write using a keyboard and am positioning myself to do real business here in the long term.   I had good prospects prior to coming to China and graduated from one of the top UK universities. I was offered a contract to train as an accountant that would pay around 30,000 pounds plus benefits. I am torn over whether or not taking up this offer would have been a better choice. In the long term, financially speaking, training as an accountant would have certainly been the better bet. In terms of lifestyle it's difficult to assess.   Living in China is fascinating but it is by no means easy. In a small city you will find your peers are invariably not great ""quality"": They seem to be either very young, unqualified young men working in training centers, spending a lot of time drinking and hanging out with each other even though they don't actually get on very well; Alternatively, you will find a lot of older men working in Universities who have categorically failed in life and are bitter and resentful. My two colleagues at my university are both seriously overweight middle aged men who spend all of their free time alone in their apartments. Both are very bitter and sincerely hate China, but are trapped here financially.  Spending time with them for me is painful and they are utterly incompetent as teachers of EFL.   As a result, I almost exclusively spend time with Chinese people, many of whom are much older than me. These relationships are very transactional. You are a little bit like a fashion accessory and in return for accompanying them to diner or playing tennis with them they help you find private students and turn you on to other commercial opportunities in the city.   Chinese women are another problem. You will find it incredibly easy to get laid but this is something of a double edged sword. For me anyway, I find Chinese girls sexually very attractive but unsuitable for a long term relationship. This state of affairs often leaves me feeling lonely, even though company is so easy to come by.    If I had stayed in the UK and started working my personal life would be much more satisfying but by no means as varied. Financially I would be better off and my future would look much more certain.   Overall, there is good money to be made doing this, but it is not a career and it is difficult to see how you can make a career doing TEFL in China. I plan on doing this for another two years and saving enough to fully fund my studies for a masters. Then I need to get a proper job, with a pension and security, in a developed country or with an international company in Shanghai.   Furthermore, there are two major threats to this whole enterprise looming on the horizon: A serious economic downturn that could hit consumer spending and thus your income hard and also see the value of your RMB denominated savings plummet. Secondly, increased restrictions on those foreign teachers already working at universities, as part of the anti-westernization campaign, that may manifest in crackdowns on out of contract work, dramatically increasing the implicit cost of the enterprise by adding risks such as your assets being seized or your contract being terminated, all requiring you to operate much more discretely.   I hope this helps you make an informed decision."

In the long term, financially speaking, training as an accountant would have certainly been the better bet. In terms of lifestyle it's difficult to assess.    This is sort of off topic but...  I'm an accountant (I still hold my practice cert). Personally I moved out of it because I saw the technical singularity (in another thread) problems crop up.  Over time fewer and fewer people could add value and anything low level was outsourced. While this was good for those that were established and at the top. It was not so good for those at the bottom and the middle. As with your ESOL teacher example there are very few at the top and a whole glut of people in the middle.  Every year I remember boxes of audit files being unloaded. One day we were told to leave them alone. The Polish girl took them instead and scanned them to be uploaded to a server in Pakistan.  As an accountant in the UK because of the experience requirements you get treated like shit for the first 3 years as your bosses KNOW you have to complete your training. The difficulty is the exams AND work at the same time.  A typical day as a PQ get up at 7am. Leave home at 7.30 ride into work (I rode a motorbike so traffic was not a concern) get in at 7.45. Then have a look at your messages and the priority list as things get bumped. Then grab the files and sit down and start your jobs. Get constantly phoned for information from other accountants in the building. 15 min lunch at desk. Then more boxes of audit work to go through. Maybe visit the audit site to verify existence. Do a few calculations on materiality and slowly go through a phone book sized number of tick boxes. 4.30pm you are not finished. You get the overflow jobs if somebody is sick or somebody is on holiday. You do the odd jobs like finish off a set of accounts and prep a D file, do some corporate tax returns. Get a tax plan box (which is like Mr X has A assets, B shares C etc etc and you organise it into a tax efficient structure). Leave at 7-8pm depending on how many overflow files there are.   Get home shower, eat then finish the jobs that were uploaded to your personal space, this might be checking over the D file of a junior and or cross checking somebody's work rarely there was none like Feb 2nd after tax season. THEN at 9pm you get your ACCA study books and or material out and study. A decent firm will send you to somewhere like Kaplan to learn in a class environment you can tell by the hours they start as to how hetic accountant lives are as the classes start at 7.30 sometimes.  Funny enough I am sometimes the guy at the front of the classroom at Kaplan. I think the ceiling of pay is lower but how many get to the top anyway?"

Basically having no life outside of work and finding the work itself mundane.   But if course accountants are typically pretty well remunerated, especially those in management positions. But I agree that due to the quantitative and somewhat algorithmic nature of the work it is perhaps not the best time to become an accountant.   Can I ask what are your long term career plans and how you ended up out here? You strike me as atypical, although my exposure to ESL teachers in China has been pretty limited.   I think I will do another two academic years at my current university and then go on to study at one of the joint venture campuses in China, probably doing something very general like management. Hopefully, after four years of continuously living in China, trying my best to immerse myself in the language and culture, trying to be entrepreneurial and taking a very professional attitude towards teaching and other private work I will be highly proficient at actually operating on the ground here. Perhaps I will be able to get a stable job with a Chamber of Commerce or a big company looking for foreign hires. I can genuinely see myself living in China for the rest of my working life."

To muddle through and stay with my current organisation for another 1-2 years and grab as many teaching hours as possible and and to try move up into an in-sessional EAP teacher (term time now just summer). This pays a lot and is generally considered to be the fairly high tier ESOL type teaching in the UK. I'm in a good position right now.  Although there is some sort of end goal it's hazy and it is not clear cut. Last year we thought ESOL would go through an apocalypse but I got a job with my current company. I have a completely unrelated retirement plan which is a hobby right now.   and how you ended up out here?    I'm still in the UK. I do the odd trek out to Europe to do short term teaching gigs. I very very nearly took a job in Japan at a top 20 University but my mum had cancer so I turned it down. Later after she got better I also very nearly took a job in Hong Kong for a university. I was >< close and had signed the contract ready to send it back to them. Mum became seriously ill and passed away last year.  I don't want to work in China because I know all too well about the discrimination if you don't look right. I happen to look Chinese due to my parents being Taiwanese/Hong Kong Chinese. I've had far far too many your CV is impressive please can you send a photo? I send a photo and they suddenly go silent. I can speak read/write various flavours of Chinese makes v little difference even non ESOL subjects which I can teach.  I know it is an image driven industry. But I'm not sure if I can explain it succinctly. It hurts at a deep internal level you know? In that there is a personal feeling of a lack of belonging here in the UK. Yet amongst what are considered to be my people there is even a bigger disconnect and sense of rejection.    You strike me as atypical,    I am atypical. I simply realised one day life is too short for this shit and walked out of the office one rainy day. I think it might have been seeing one too many of my biker friends die... I decided to go for a ride. I found myself on the coast of the sea of Japan a few months later. I still do accountancy but only on my terms and for clients I choose.

I think what got to me was simply the toxic environment and the lack of interaction with people. Spending 8-12 hours a day in front of a screen then meeting with clients who don't want to pay you anything or be there is horrible. Students who appreciate what you do (a student bought me a Starwars poster and a box of chocolates for my teaching on Tuesday at the end of the course, nobody EVERY bought me anything as an accountant ever) and you can see grow is part of why I do it. The paperwork which I've just spent 4 hours doing does my head in though. Which is why I don't like working for 6th form colleges."
TEFL,3cf19b,OttawaLitecoins,2,Wed Jul 8 20:12:17 2015 UTC,"First, you should be getting paid more for a university job. Aim for 6000 rmb a month + off campus housing (or an allowance) + paid holidays + 8000 rmb flight bonus outside of tier 1 cities. Also tell them you want to work 2.5 days a week, or have a good schedule like mornings only. Last semester I worked 4 mornings 8-11:40 and it was great.  In terms of finding tutoring work, you won't find it from your university students. I only know of one teacher doing that and he was just tutoring IELTS to one of his students. If you are lazy tou can contact agents in your city and they'll fidn you work. But you'll have to take a lower pay. In my city if I find work on my own I charge 175-250 rmb/h depending on the age, size...etc. With agents I get 150 rmb/h. Also agents will give you a lot of kindergarten work, which many people don't like doing. And sometimes agents will give you weird ""white face"" jobs such as sitting at a promotion booth for a training centre or once i gave a 30 minute presentation to some small kids about Canada (got paid for 2 hours). Negotiate a taxi fee too if the job is far away.  Another way to do it is find a Chinese friend to posts ads on Chinese sites. I have a friend who got a really good gig with good students on Saturdays. Six hours of teaching @250 rmb/h + paid dinner. The only problem is its from 11-1, 2-4, 6-8 so it takes a full day, but this doubles his monthly salary  The most important thing is to not get lazy. It's very easy to be lazy working these small hours cause for me anyway my pay is more than enough. This semester I did only 1 extra hour, but last semester I was doing 5-10 extra per week  Oh ya antoher idea. Make a new skype account and list what city you are in. Add a bunch of agents and they'll start spamming you gigs in your city. I haven't tried this myself, but I know someone else who does this. He sifts through the messages every night."

TEFL,3cf19b,dcrm,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:15:40 2015 UTC,"It is possible but not likely as this point they are much smarter with their money as they are already paying for a university tuition.  My opinion is that in general you are not going to make as much money from private tutoring as you think, even with primary/secondary school children.  Unless you are an exception your main income is going to be from you job, it's pretty hard to find consistent private tuition in China especially with the ridiculous amount of competitiveness there is in China for the market.  There are a lot of Americans charging 70 kuai an hour for private lessons who have a degree or cheap skype lessons and a lot of non native's with good English that are cheap and people will gravitate towards.  My advice is unless they are paying you a 30 hour+ wage for those 12 hours to look elsewhere.  Don't bank on private tuition, how many people come back from China rich on this?  None."
TEFL,3cf19b,Leetenghui,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:33:23 2015 UTC,"Well frankly I'm only getting paid 4800 without housing which I know is a very low pay, but I assumed the 12 hours work would not require as much prep for a uni job. I then considered if I got 5 tutees a week at 200rmb an hour then I'd be OK. Obviously I may be way off here and if I am then I'd appreciate you shooting me down :P"
TEFL,3cf19b,Leetenghui,2,Tue Jul 7 19:26:55 2015 UTC,"Well frankly I'm only getting paid 4800 without housing which I know is a very low pay, but I assumed the 12 hours work would not require as much prep for a uni job.   Why do you assume this? It depends on the standards and how rigorously they are applied.  In the UK where I work when I get a university gig the standards are high and they are all rigorously applied. Therefore one hour in class takes 1-2 outside the classroom. The most ridiculous was when I worked for a private university with some very strong students. They generated tons of marking and did tons of homework... marking essays takes a lot longer than multiple choice. They recognised this with a very high pay rate.  Also there is prep needed with private students. A 1-1 session burns material faster than a class of 15-20 students. Students can also sense if you've not prepared a lesson properly as well therefore you may well lose your private students if you don't prep properly and give them something interesting or something they want. it is also just you to bounce things off meaning 1-1 classes can be more draining than classes where you can get students to bounce things off each other."

TEFL,3cf19b,dcrm,2,Wed Jul 8 13:36:24 2015 UTC,"No problem, I'm not here to shoot anyone down just give realistic estimates cause I feel most people skew the situation.  You can make your own judgement from what you have researched too.  It's not as lucrative as most people point out and it's pretty competitive.  Chinese people are not stupid with their money.  Most people exaggerate their lifestyle.  I know at least 50+ tefl teachers from beijing, shijiazhuang and shanghai.  The ones with the most experience (5 years+) are looking at a monthly take home of 15,000 kuai with shared accommodation (30 hours teaching time/10 hours office).  It's tough for them to get private students and they're CELTA qualified with large amounts of classroom time.  What they do find in private tuition is inconsistent and they'll average maybe 130 rmb/h in Beijing (rich clients).  Don't even bother with the average folk they cannot afford this rate.   Inside shijuazhuang I got about 120/h and in a smaller town it's worse I had ridiculously rich people scrimp over 100 kuai/hour.  I know this was the case for most people because these rich people had hired American tutors before me on the same wage.  100/h.  Anyway as for your pay, yeah it's low but it's better to be honest about it than to convince yourself it is great and take the offer.  I went from being an expat working for a foreign software house on a good pay packet (45,000 kuai/month) to a TEFL teacher because I didn't want to go back home when my company wanted me back in London.  So I resigned.  I wouldn't call it a mistake because I love China but as one of the higher earning teachers told me I'm never going to make that in China as a teacher - ever.  Ok back to my suggestion for you and some questions; which city will you be living?  Do you hold a degree?  TEFL Certificate?  To put it short, even if you have no teaching experience... if you hold a degree and a tefl certificate you can find 7,000 kuai a month + free accommodation (1,500~) and a 12 hour contract in a small city.  It's not that difficult.  5,000 kuai contracts with free accommodation are a dime a dozen in small cities for non degree holders but you are gonna have to jump through a lot of hoops to renew your 90 day visa and it will be out of your own pocket.  I'd say find something else."
TEFL,3cf19b,Hautamaki,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:48:53 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for the advice, I really appreciate it and will take it on board.  The job on offer is in Hangzhou, and I do hold a degree and TEFL certificate.  I guess what got me especially excited is that it is a university position which I assumed were few and far between. Do you think its realistic that I could perhaps find a similar job with better pay?  Also, glad I know not rely on tutoring to make up for low pay packets."
TEFL,3cf19b,dcrm,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:16:51 2015 UTC,"I ain't rich, but I've bought a house, a parking spot, and a car in the last 3 years.  It's definitely more than possible to make some very decent money focusing on private classes.  However, you do have to be able to speak Chinese.  All other qualifications, experience, etc, pale in importance compared to being able to speak Chinese."
TEFL,3cf19b,rogercoger,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:15:18 2015 UTC,"Have to disagree, it's possible but not easy and I can speak mandarin.  There are so many people doing it you can find good teachers on the cheap these days.  If you were to take lets say the average salary for a tefl teacher + private tuition you are probably looking at 15,000 rmb monthly with years of experience.  Compare that to like the average manager/business expat who is probably closer to 60,000 rmb monthly after tax + free car etc...  I find it hard to buy your story that you earn 90% of your salary from tuition but lets say you do you still probably aren't gonna hit that mark and you are an extreme exception.  Every TEFL teacher I knew in China was poor,  I don't know anyone like you at all and I know a ridiculous amount of wai guo ren.  It gets even worse if you compare it to a salary back home, in my field (which is kindof an average tech degree) you are looking at 130k USD anually.  Electronics, rent and petrol to an extent isn't that much cheaper if at all in China.  So it actually kindof sucks for saving money.  The truly best bet to make money in china is to do something like consultancy and you are looking at similar rates to the US of 1k USD on a daily rate.  TEFL isn't profitable, to make decent margins you are going to have to put a lot more hours into it than you would a normal expat job and even then you'll have to pray.  I know this having lived on both sides, the professional expats all live like kings in China and the TEFL peeps are all relatively poor.  I think people should get into it for the lifestyle, if it worked for you great but you've lived in China you have to be aware of the amount of poor foreigners living there who just ""drift"".  I definitely wouldn't give someone the impression that they will be making 90% of their income from tuition unless they are on like 1k a month...  If he manages to add 3k kuai a month via private lessons 6 months after being in China he'll be doing really well and the industry is just going downhill from the vast amount of degree holding white americans working for 3,000-5,000 kuai a month.  This guy was almost one of them.  So on topic OP, you should be aiming for 10,000 kuai in your position for a 12 hour work week in Guangzhou"
TEFL,3cf19b,dcrm,3,Wed Jul 8 04:22:49 2015 UTC,"It's true that most foreigners don't make my kind of money.  In fact in my city I doubt there's anyone who makes more than me.  But it has more to do with complacency and ignorance than lack of ability or potential.  The truth is that there are probably plenty of teachers who make their students in the classroom just as happy as I do and are just as reliable, professional, well-qualified, etc as I am.  The reason I make more money than they do is because I know how to ask for it, in Chinese, to the people who matter.  Schools make boatloads of money in China, but it doesn't go to the foreigners; it goes to the owners.  If you want to be the one making money, you have to be working for yourself, first off.  Secondly, you have to actually know your value.  A foreign teacher class should be bringing in anywhere from 500 to 1000 rmb per hour.  That's not a questionable amount; if anything that's a conservative amount.  In Harbin I bring in at least 700 rmb per class and Harbin is tier 3.  The only real question is who's going to be getting that money.  If you can speak Chinese and find students yourself and organize things yourself, you are the one getting that money.  And at ~1000 per class (90-120 mins), 12 classes a week, you are making ~50,000 rmb, tax free.  Your paltry salary from whatever university you work at pays your living expenses so you keep what you make from privates.  Now yes, as I admit, most teachers don't do this.  The main reason is not lack of ability, it's lack of even realizing that this is possible for anyone who can speak decent Chinese.  But you can't do it at a training center--training centers are your competition.  If you work at one, they'll keep you busy during your prime earning time, which is weekends and after school.  Also, you will find it hard to find students that way since your main contacts will just be poaching off the training center.  So don't work at a training center, for starters.  Secondly, if you work at a university, you will also find it difficult to get students, because as I said your prime market is primary school.  IME the best age by far to start is Grade 3 of primary school.  The best way to get these students is to actually work at a primary school.  I have students I've taught for 8 or 9 years that started with me in primary school and just stayed with me until uni.  It's hard work at first, yes.  You will have your 'full time' job at the primary school where you'll do 20-30 forty minute lessons per week, and then you'll also be working nights and weekends making your real money.  This will be a 60+ hour work week for the first few years.  Later, once you have a good client base built up, you can switch to a university and do your 12-18 lessons which is like 2.5 days work.  The downside is that yes this is probably a 7 day per week job, unless you arrange yourself a full weekday off.  But of course at 1000+ rmb per class, you may not WANT a day off.  That's if you want to make money.  Which is the other reason that most foreign teachers don't make much money.  They just don't care that much.  Even my best friends who know me very well and know exactly what I do don't do what I do to make as much as I do, even though they could, because that's not why they came to China.  They came here to have an easier life, not to work harder.  Most people who want to work hard and make as much money as possible aren't the kind of people that would get into teaching in the first place.  They'd be doing consultancy or IT in North America or whatever they are good at to make a lot of money.  Being a foreign teacher just doesn't tend to get lots of very ambitious and money hungry people gravitating to it.  But don't confuse that for a lack of potential.  There is plenty of potential to make very decent money in TEFL for the kinds of people who care about that."
TEFL,3cf19b,rogercoger,2,Wed Jul 8 13:07:57 2015 UTC,"You are probably in the top 1 percentile, maybe even 0.5.  However even given what you claim you can earn (in a seven day work week).  25% of expats in china are professionals and they are probably on a median income of around 800,000- 1 million kuai.  With western anual leave and chinese national holidays.  It's really easy to earn 600,000 kuai anually as a professional after tax with a ton of benefits, it's near impossible to do it with private English tuition.  It's a saturated and unskilled market, I know a guy who had a 1st class in English from Cambridge and couldn't get over 200 kuai an hour and even that was a once weekly lesson.  If you want to make more money from English go to South Korea but even then it's not a good market.  Also there is the added problem that when you come home you aren't going to be able to find a good job, even if you worked in an international school it won't be easy.    TEFL could be advantageous to those with a useless degree or no career prospects but an engineer, tech or bank accountant with a wealth of knowledge (7 years experience~) with fluent English get ridiculous deals on China on a daily basis.  It's a much less risky way to make money and a career and as mentioned before you can get a 6 month consultant contract worth 7000 kuai a day (8 hour days), 5 days a week.  Six months straight income.  Little risk involved and completely 100% legal.  Even chinese citizen in these fields are banking 25-30k kuai monthly.  The days of foreigners with no skills being thought of as amazing are long since gone, twenty years ago and you could have made some really decent money."
TEFL,3cf19b,Hautamaki,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:35:29 2015 UTC,Good post. Do you know anyone who started out as a University teacher and then transitioned in to any of these more lucrative and stable forms of employment?
TEFL,3cf19b,rogercoger,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:40:15 2015 UTC,"Yes I do, they are not so common but they exist!  My general advice would be, the earlier you start tefl and subsequently get out of it the better.  If it's your first job and you spend a few years in your early twenties and go home,  nobody is going to care that much.  I have recruited for two companies (in the UK), it's completely understandable early in your career to have large gap years for these type of things.  However if did lets say banking for a year, taught for 6 years and went back at 30.  It's probably going to be harder to get employed.  I'm sure you can understand the reasons why, would you hire a fresh graduate with recent university experience for the same wage as someone who has done something unrelated for years.  Probably not.  You can teach back home and it's not by any means a terrible job it just isn't that great.   So to sum up assuming you are 22-24, try out tefl for a year or two, go back and try a career in something else (that is big in china).  If you absolutely loathe it but love teaching, then there is no point in doing it just for the money.  You are going to be depressed.  In such a case I would just stick it out in the TEFL industry, nobody can tell you what will make you the happiest.  I would just suggest to give other career options within china a consideration as they are generally safer options than TEFL and people often overlook these for the immediate ""glamorous"" option of going to a foreign country to live."

They want me to work for them, teaching kids and adults tennis for a flat fee. But it ain't going to work like that. At least 50 percent of class revenue or nothing (although these devious Chinese will lie to me about the total revenue - this is where your combative Chinese GF pays her way)   The aim is to get a native English speaking child for every five Chinese kids (the foreign kids can come for free) and use the kids as little teaching assistants, creating a sort of immersion environment.

For one thing, you are more likely to interact with locals in really remote places with Peace Corps, while TEFL is more likely to have you living in a special expatriate bubble. Also, PC has special hiring perks with Federal Government jobs, and, like you mention, is a recognizable brand for a lot of things, including employment and graduate school.

I will say, however, that they might be a much better line on your resume in the future.   EF is reputable, you'll get paid, but people have very different experiences with them, and a lot of people see those experiences as negative. You can google for the feedback of the really bitter ones. EF's not atrocious by any means, but the stories I've been told by friends paint a picture of a very corporate culture rather than educational. You might have a ton of work with mediocre facilities with bosses that care more about the bottom line than educational quality. It can make some people feel devalued and unmotivated. I worked for them briefly in the States and didn't like the culture.  But hey, that's a risk with most China jobs!

Teaching is very rewarding but that really comes once you've got the hang of it.  In terms of the future, you can apply for TEFL jobs in China next year. I don't know how easily you can reapply for the peace corps."

TEFL,3cdphz,Whiskey_McSwiggens,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:04:14 2015 UTC,You need to add to your qualifications if you're going to continue to teach.  I doubt any government positions even teaching in the DoC would let someone with just a TEFL cert and 5 years of overseas experience in.  You're also in trouble going for a government job because of your experience in the KSA. That kind of experience isn't looked on too favorably in America.

This is due to certain governmental entities requiring those documents, not due to pure stupidity or anything.   I would recommend just getting the cheapest ""120 hour"" TEFL you can.

TEFL,3cde9g,bears2013,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:41:56 2015 UTC,"Being a certified teacher is the best thing you could do in the field. Even people with masters degrees may get turned away if they don't have edu-related degrees or an actual teaching certification (if the school actually cares about quality of instructors, they'll pay way more attention to a certified teacher with experience than someone with a recent MA in English lit and no pedagogical background--my school had an issue where they realized a guy with a non-teaching MA and no certs didn't know how to teach and didn't even know proper English grammar).   Imo international schools are where the best jobs are; being someone like me with a BA and a CELTA with a year of experience, ~$25k is around the upper limit.. But for the highly ranked international schools, which all require certified teachers, you could easily make $35-50k. Obviously you couldn't land a job like that your first year, but with some experience you could.   So no, not only is your lack of TEFL cert not a problem, you've got a competitive edge."

TEFL,3cb8gt,jostler57,7,Mon Jul 6 15:39:04 2015 UTC,"As to the question of free time and supplemental income, I would ask about the curriculum you will be teaching and the expected prep time. To teach well (which can help to get lucrative tutoring gigs) requires solid preparation--if you're preparing customized lectures and assignments and providing detailed student feedback, 11 hours of face time can quickly bloom into a full time job. And if you just use cookie-cutter materials and do nothing beyond the bare minimum of presenting what you're given, prep time can be down to travel time to class plus a few seconds to open the book to the right page or open the relevant slides. What do they expect of you? What do you expect of yourself?"
TEFL,3cb8gt,cuginhamer,6,Mon Jul 6 18:11:37 2015 UTC,"They said that it's 4 classes a day, from 8:30-12:10, 40 mins per class (so, appears to have small breaks, between).   There's no office time, classes are arranged in the morning, and school gives teaching materials & textbooks. Unsure what, exactly, they expect from me, other than teaching during these hours.   You bring up a really great point about expectations and prep time:  I expect myself to be the best teacher I can be, and for students to truly grasp the language. You're probably right that I'll need to do a lot of prep for classes - that didn't occur to me, previously (this will be my first teaching job)."
TEFL,3cb8gt,cuginhamer,13,Mon Jul 6 18:20:33 2015 UTC,"I expect myself to be the best teacher I can be, and for students to truly grasp the language.       Such a sweet sentiment, honestly, and a warm personality will take you a long way. Reminds me of being a new teacher and having no fucking idea of what's about to go down. Soon you will be formally welcomed into the world of the realities of teaching.       If you really care about being your best and students really making great strides in English, the nitty gritty of the classroom materials and presentation content and activities is the most important thing. Relevant follow-up questions:      What will you do if you find that the materials they give you don't make you a very good teacher (i.e. they are so shitty it's embarrassing to use them)?      Do you think students will have the best ""true grasp"" of the language by listening to English lectures and doing written homework?  What style of teaching do you believe in? Obviously you're willing to go with the school's judgment, at least at first, but it's worth thinking about what makes sense to you.  Will students speak in class?     What is your expected class size?   What kind of activities will you be hosting?     If they have homework, is it written and turned in for you? is it graded electronically? do they expect you to give feedback? is there an oral component to homework assignments?     Will you be teaching practice TOEFL questions? conversation? academic English? special topics in English?    For me, academic freedom and being a content creator/innovator rather than a happy-faced presenter-bot doing what amounts to customer service all day long is essential to be happy as a teacher. For others, this stuff doesn't matter much. But no matter where you are on that spectrum, you should ask for some insight into how you are going to be expected to teach English, what aspects of English, and what materials you will be given to teach it. For example, you might ask for an overview of the course objectives and list of textbooks for each grade level you will teach, you can ask about class size and homework/grading expectations, and typical prep time.       Final word to the wise: Do you know what's the best thing to ask for? Contact information for a few other current or past Americans who have served as teachers from the school. Some schools are complete shit, horrible management, mean people, toxic communication, and lose teachers like crazy and rehire like crazy to fill the void. Others are boatloads of awesome and people stay longer than they originally planned. And you won't know until you talk to people who've worked there or work there yourself. So, just like they might ask you for references, why not ask them for references?"

TEFL,3cb8gt,bears2013,2,Mon Jul 6 17:43:48 2015 UTC,"I did a a 16 hour week teaching placement in China.  Few things I'll mention.  Yeah the life is really relaxing and it wont be stressful at all but it will work out to a lot more than 11 hours a week.  Especially since you are teaching a lot of varying grades and you'll likely be doing a lot of extra stuff - including make your exams, marking etc...  I'd see a realistic estimate is probably a 20 hour work week.  If you can ask them to make sure all your work hours are within this period if not you are going to be spending most of the day waiting around to go back to class and then it's essentially an extra 10 hours of wasted time, if they are allowed to move your hours to suit them - they will.    I would not advise working at an\zother school, if they find out it's all over and private schools are pretty competitive in china especially Guangzhou.  Working for yourself is fine but it's not so easy and if competitors find out they will report you.  As for the salary it's pretty standard in Guangzhou, if they are supplying you with non shared accommodation I'd say this is a really good offer because of the work hours and not advise you to negotiate - they likely won't!.  Also it wont work out to anywhere near 110 dollars an hour, you're probably looking at 20 USD/h which is still pretty decent."

I think they'll try to keep my hours worked consolidated, so I won't have any back-and-forth, which is nice. At least I'll have a great deal of my day to myself.

The connection was very, very fast - a week or two, as my friend's mother is friends with this agent.

I did my CELTA like a month or two before leaving to the country lol.  Considering that you're only working 16 40-min lessons a week, I think the salary is quite reasonable. The average workload at a school is about 20-26 teaching hours, in addition to after school participation and lesson planning.   While you're still in the states, I'd recommend buying some fun word games or puzzles--just fun activities to get the younger kids motivated; that's one thing I missed my first year, was not being able to just order what I needed on Amazon lol. Planning a good lesson is something you'll learn as you go along.   In regard to your contract--does it say anything about housing? Health care? Sick days?

TEFL,3caers,Savolainen5,4,Mon Jul 6 10:43:55 2015 UTC,"I have been waiting for this.   Ok, so I came to Bangkok to get my CELTA from IH Bangkok directly after finishing an English degree in Professional Writing in America. I knew I wanted to teach adults, and I didn't really like kids nor did I want to deal with classroom management. Post-CELTA, I easily found work at a language school making 40,000 baht per month, with lots of opportunity for overtime. Pretty good for a teacher with absolutely no experience, and certainly better than the 30-35k a lot of teachers make at government schools. Anyway...language schools overwork you in Thailand and there is little chance for any mobility in the short term. The real money is in private schools and international schools. After completing my contract at the language school, I randomly applied for a job that would pay a lot more, teaching kids at a private school. Well, now I teach kids. I make more money, teach only around 17 hours a week, and have little/no responsibilities in terms of grading or extracurricular stuff. Easy money, but mentally boring, so I still teach IELTS and academic English on the weekends, more so for fun than the extra money, but that's nice too.   Overall experience is good, but I have only lived in Bangkok, which is not a good representation of Thailand as a whole. Bangkok is a huge city; there is nothing else like it in Thailand. Anyone teaching in rural Thailand will have a much different experience. I liked my adult (mostly uni) students. I was 23 when I started, so we were the same age and I became friends with some of them. I don't like my kids. They are, quite frankly, disrespectful and spoiled brats (I work at a ""name brand"" private school, and rich people in Bangkok are...entitled to say the least). Their kids do whatever they want, and the parents may lose face if their kids fuck up, so the school is very reluctant to raise any issues. My young students are disrespectful for the most part, and Thai teachers do not care. I suspect this is specific to my school as I have spoken to other teachers who taught here before and said at their new jobs the students are better. This school is in a slightly unique position as it is a Thai run private school, but not international. The mentality and discipline is Thai. Thai teachers can hit the kids (usually with sticks and rulers), but foreigners cannot, and the kids take advantage of this. We also have no ability to contact parents, as only their homeroom teachers can, and they usually don't care what happens in the English classes. Thai culture is not big on responsibility; usually things are always someone else's problem. Also many Thai teachers can't speak English so it's difficult to know if they really understand the issues. Co-workers are awesome, everyone in Bangkok is great and very social, although drinking is a big part of social interaction, so I hope you like to party. There are plenty of weird/crazy people here for questionable reasons, but if you are young and normal, don't worry.  Teaching is laid back in most places. There has been very little oversight at both my schools, which is a double edged sword. Teach what you want, but don't expect much support from staff/admin. This seems to be the case in most of Thailand. Walked into my language school after my CELTA program finished. Hired two days later. Found my new job online and got an interview/demo lesson. You really need to be here in person to get a good job. Started off at 40k/month, make nearly double that now in my second year when I account for my private lessons and weekend work, which allows me to live comfortably in Bangkok. Facebook groups are the most useful thing. ""Teachers in Thailand"" This is Thailand. TiT. Be ready for anything and never be surprised. If you question things or try to fix things too much, you will go crazy. I think you have to be a relatively laid back person to really enjoy living/working in Thailand.   Ask me any other questions here, or PM me if you want. Happy to help."

Would you recommend it to someone else?   This is such a loaded question. Working in Thailand poses a ton headaches. After 2 years it's starting to wear on me and I'm probably going to move on soon. That said I've enjoyed my 2 years here. Lifestyle here is great, it's just the actual teaching part that really kind of sucks.   What did you like? What did you not like?   I like living here. It's laid back, semi-cheap, amazing scenery, easy to travel to surrounding countries, nice weather, nice people, etc. I don't like the government, the convoluted visas, the joke of an education system, the mai pen rai attitude towards everything, etc etc.   Where did you work? City or region, what kind of school?   Bangkok atm. Also lived in a small town for a year. I've worked at a private school, university, and public school.   What were your students like? Age, attitude?   I've taught from grades 7-university. As with anywhere you have good kids and bad kids. Generally the kids are great here though, much better than my classmates anyway.   What were your co-workers and bosses like?   Bosses are inept idiots. Co-wokers range from sexpats and people who failed at life in their home country, to young backpackers, to genuinely great people who love their work.   What is the teaching culture like?   A joke. The entire education system is laughable.   How did you get hired? Was that typical of this country?   I've been offered the job on the spot at every interview I've ever had here (over 10). If you have white skin, a pulse, & look even semi-presentable then you'll get a job.   What was your pay? How did it compare to living expenses?   Again. It's ranged from 25k baht - 50k baht. 25k was in a small town and was livable though I wasn't saving much. 50k in BKK is livable though I'm still not able to save much. I enjoy a good lifestyle though. Western food a few times a week. A couple nights out a month. Able to travel on holidays.   What are some good websites where one can find useful information about TEFL in this country?   ajarn.com (or my blog - www.abroadwithalec.com)   Anything else a prospective TEFL would need to know about this country? Life pro tips for this country?   Come to enjoy life but don't expect to make a career here unless you land a gig at one of the big international schools hauling in 110k + per month.

I'd recommended teaching here for entry level TEFL teachers looking to have fun, to travel, and to have experiences. Teaching here offers a lot of opportunities for traveling and doing cool stuff. I wouldn't recommend it to qualified, experienced teachers looking to further their careers. I also wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is serious about education and academia. You won't enjoy teaching here and most likely you will end up causing problems with the school and/or other Thai teachers.    What did you like? What did you not like?   I like the food, traveling around, and the relaxed lifestyle (this is a double edged sword).  I don't like the corruption, the ""saving face"" culture, no accountability, and the abysmal education system.    Where did you work? City or region, what kind of school?   University level in the Isaan region.    What were your students like? Age, attitude?   My students are generally around the early 20's. They are very immature in comparison to 20 somethings in the West. Most of the time they couldn't care less about school (not just learning English). They are very sweet kids, but they are awful students. The school fosters bad students, and I was told many, many times to just lower my standards and let the kids pass my class. There's no accountability for their work, they cheat like crazy, skip class and show up late daily, and just don't really care about their education. I wouldn't say this is true across the board, but I teach at a pretty low end universities so my students are about as bad as they come at the university level.    What were your co-workers and bosses like?   I'm very lucky to have a very sweet, kind Thai boss. She spent years in the States and really understands Westerners. That being said, I have worked for other people who's only concern was to take advantage of their foreign teachers. I don't have much interaction with other Thai teachers, but the office workers are horrendous. One was fired for stealing computers and selling them to cover his betting habit. The other one leaves for lunch at 11:00 am and starts drinking only to return at 2:00-3:00 drunk. He has caused so many problems at the office, but because he has connections with other people at the university, they can't get rid of him. He truly makes work a lot less enjoyable. Employees are seldom held to any real standard, and I have heard horror stories about some of their classroom practices.    What is the teaching culture like?   Absolutely awful.    How did you get hired? Was that typical of this country?   Got my job through my alma mater back in the States. My university back home had signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the university here in Thailand, so there was already an established connection between the schools.    What was your pay? How did it compare to living expenses?   25K in Isaan. That's pretty low, but I also have very low teaching hours (12 teaching hours a week). Also, my visa and work permit is paid through the school. Despite the low salary, you can still live comfortably on that wage in Isaan.    What are some good websites where one can find useful information about TEFL in this country?   http://www.ajarn.com/   Anything else a prospective TEFL would need to know about this country? Life pro tips for this country?   Feel free to message me if you have any specific questions. There is so much I could say about living and teaching in Thailand. LPT for Thailand? Everything is done at the last minute, so if you are someone who has to have things planned out, then forget about coming here. Also, you have to be very flexible to teach here because things change hour to hour here. Also, it's very hard to get a straight answer about things for several reasons, so things often take 10 times longer than you think they should. One more thing, there is a huge difference between the lifestyle and environment in Bangkok compared to Isaan, or Chaing Mai compared to down south, so just make sure you understand what you are getting yourself into before you take a job. Don't take  a job in rural Thailand if you are someone who wants a lot of comforts. Conversely, understand what living in Bangkok is like before you take a job there. Some people love BKK and some people cannot stand it. Just understand what you are getting yourself into and make sure you're okay with it.   EDIT: One thing I wish I knew before coming here was the sign in policy at school. This is where you have to sign in to work everyday when you arrive and when you leave. You have to do this even on days you don't have class and even between semester breaks. That means you won't be taking trips between semesters unless you arrange for time off which oftentimes means your pay will be docked. This was a pretty big deal for me, since my school is pretty strict about signing in everyday. It's probably the single main reason I won't stay teaching in Thailand for very long. It varies from school to school and even department to department. Some schools are strict about signing in and other schools aren't."

TEFL,3caers,MadeForTeaVea,3,Wed Jul 8 00:35:13 2015 UTC,"Of course, all this varies from school to school.  Generally speaking, wages for teachers are low which keeps qualified, experienced teachers away. The education system is Thailand is horrendous, and the controlling governmental factions want to keep people uneducated. It quite sad. Also, the corruption is ingrained in the education system as well.   The students are very bad as well. I found my students are often very sweet kids, but they are terrible students. They aren't keen on their educations, so you won't find teaching very rewarding. Also, there are no standards for the students or the teachers. We were told just to pass students through our classes. Some of the practices by other Thai teachers were so unethical, which for the sake of brevity I won't go into.  Taking this all into account, as a teacher here, people will just assume you are here for partying and traveling, which is often the truth anyways. It's not like teaching here is a very admirable profession here. That being said, it's not all a bad thing. It's very easy to get a teaching job here, and living here can be a lot of fun and very enjoyable. For a fresh graduate looking for adventure, Thailand is a great place to start, so I'm not saying that people shouldn't come to Thailand. Not at all. I've had a blast here, but it's not because of the teaching. You just need to know what teaching here is all about and make sure it fits your personality."

TEFL,3caers,DavidOfBrooklyn,2,Sun Jul 12 04:47:53 2015 UTC,"I have a question regarding the kind of jobs you can qualify for depending on your level of education. I understand that in order to work in an international school in Thailand you need a teaching license from your home country, but is there any better paying jobs that you can get with a masters in either English or Tesol. Right now I'm about to finish my B.A in English and I am considering getting my M.A in TESOL but am unsure if it is worth it or not. Can I teach university  in Thailand with a M.A in Tesol or will I qualify for any other teaching job that pays more than the standard 35,000 baht. Thanks"
TEFL,3caers,Thailand_Throwaway,2,Mon Jul 6 14:31:40 2015 UTC,A master's will allow you to work at universities but be aware that uni jobs do not pay well...usually around 35k. Less than you can get with an undergraduate at a entry level private school teaching kids.   The real (the only) money in Thailand is in primary and secondary education at international schools. You need to be a licensed teacher from your home country in order to do this and make serious money. Around 100k/month give or take at a legit international school. These jobs are not easy to obtain.

I know a few guys who are making 1000THB per hour and up doing this. Neither of them have master degrees."

I plan to begin my teaching journey in South Korea within a few months but if I end up really enjoying the work/lifestyle, Thailand is definitely a country I'd love to spend a year or two teaching in later on down the road. Fitness is a major hobby of mine and ever since I was like 15 I've dreamed of training Muay Thai in Thailand. I have no experience with any sort of fighting disciplines, though. But if I could teach in Thailand and set aside time to train on a regular basis that might be pretty worthwhile. Or, better yet, if I could go on vacation to like Chiang Mai and train full-time for a week or so, that would be amazing."

TEFL,3ca583,dcrm,2,Tue Jul 7 01:22:08 2015 UTC,"I'm in my 7th year doing ESL abroad.  I have set the condition for myself that I will come back when I can make a certain amount of money per year from passive income due to investments. Then I could come back, not worry about getting a job immediately, and be able to live and support my wife (she is Irish, so it may take some time for her to get a green card). I don't live in a very expensive area of the USA and I already own my own house, car, and have no student loan debt; so this amount isn't like in the six figures or anything.  I think that the trap people get into is that they teach, it's easy, they make money, and spend money. When they want to go back, they have nothing to go back to (most of the people I know don't have houses or apartments, sold their cars, don't have a lot of savings). A lot of them ended up living at home for a year or two when they were over 30 and then ended up back in ESL.  If you want to seriously make this into a career, you're going to have to get some more qualifications like a master's degree and get a good job somewhere.  You CAN teach ESL and go home comfortably / retire early back home if you do things right. A good way to live is to have a goal. Once you reach that goal, you can start preparing to go home."

Did you earn your master's overseas?   Sorry for all the questions, but I'm considering a career path like EFL--->Master's Degree--->Teaching/Professor and am just wondering how exactly to accomplish this.

Even better was Skyping with friends, we fell directly into our natural language complete with slang, curse words, and colloquialisms, and at a natural speed.

My recommendation is to decide which city you'd like to live in, go to Wikipedia and make a list of the universities in that city, then email the chairs of each English department.  TEFL certificates are a dime a dozen. Don't bother with anything that isn't internationally known and backed by a real university. The only two I can vouch for are the Cambridge CELTA and the Trinity TESOL. Anything else is probably a waste of time and money."
TEFL,3c3mbh,iansarrad,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:04:39 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty heavily leaning towards Persian gulf area due to no taxes, high wage and housing included. But i know requirements are tougher, that's why i looked at China.  So you think I should directly apply to work at universities there? What about lower grade? (I'm assuming this needs certs)  Where was your first job when your qualifications were similar?"
TEFL,3c3mbh,wecandriveithome,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:47:44 2015 UTC,"I was able to get the visa and foreign expert certificate before I had the CELTA. My first (and current) job is with a university in Beijing. It's a good university (985 & 211) and the salary, housing, and airfare are all pretty good.   I recommend that you not get any TEFL very if you don't need one to get the job/visa. I heard lady year that a TEFL certificate was going to be required for new teachers, but since the new requirement didn't apply to me I didn't check it out.   Your best bet is to only get info directly from a university that you want to work for or from the Chinese government (en.safea.gov.cn); everyone else may try to sell you a certificate or give you outdated information. If you later find that you love teaching and living abroad, I maintain that the CELTA and TESOL are the only certs worth having. In my experience I absolutely believe the CELTA program made me a better teacher."
TEFL,3c3mbh,Whiskey_McSwiggens,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:58:31 2015 UTC,I can't say anything about teaching children or working in training centers. I have zero interest in doing that.
TEFL,3c3mbh,Whiskey_McSwiggens,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:59:41 2015 UTC,It seems most people are in agreement with this. You got the job at Beijing by just applying directly to universities?
