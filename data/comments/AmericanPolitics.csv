AmericanPolitics,3dw5g4,conantheking,2,Mon Jul 20 01:02:08 2015 UTC,Senator Sanders missed an opportunity there. He needs to build support among people of color. At least he didn't repeat the gaff of O'Malley by saying that white lives matter and all lives matter. Obviously that's true but it misses the point. Hopefully Sanders is working out how to better incorporate this important issue in his campaign.
AmericanPolitics,3dw5g4,yo2sense,2,Mon Jul 20 15:15:03 2015 UTC,"I think the real takeaway is that Sanders dodged the opportunity to engage on this issue.  While O'Malley may have gaffed, what he said is clearly a political reflex and Hillary has said the same thing, at least he stayed and engaged on the issue with the protestors.  I look forward to his policy proposal on criminal justice reform to be released."

AmericanPolitics,3dsj5k,conantheking,2,Sun Jul 19 01:10:51 2015 UTC,There isn't a lot in the article about Senator Sanders. If we ignore the 5 paragraphs in the middle of the article talking about differences between Democrats and Republicans which don't mention either candidate then there are 14 paragraphs. 5 paragraphs mention both men. None discuss Bernie Sanders alone whereas 9 focus only on Donald Trump.   So this isn't really about Senator Sanders. The author has something to say about Donald Trump and about some differences between Republicans and Democrats. So maybe they should change the headline.

Gay Marriage...they're still pushing for an already failed agenda.  I like this one, abolish the IRS, yet have a flat tax and/or change the tax code. So, no department to ensure taxes are paid or paid correctly. Yeah, look at Greece for that failed idea.  Common Core is a funny one. They want education to be left up to the States, yet Common Core allows for States to do exactly that.  How about Iran, the deal is bad in every way, we should be in another war we can't afford. Basically pure stupidity that we can see is killing us.  Social Security, raise the age on young people, vouchers, self investments into an unstable, crap regulated markets. Perfect for those who can afford that, never talk about the govt taking money from it, never talk about raising the caps for higher incomes.  The wage gap, yeah, more work hasn't solved a damn thing, at all, yet that's what they push.  How are those right to work States working out?

There may be some overlap but I probably have the same amount disdain for neocons as you.   Border security is something the all recent president have failed at and this is on purpose. I have no love for Bush Sr/Jr anyway but I dislike them even more so because they flew the conservative flag yet did nothing to secure the homeland from illegals.  Religious neocons got trolled into using their religion to oppose gay marriage. One doesn't need religion to be against gay marriage. I am a dyed in the wool atheist and I oppose any marriage that isn't between one man and one woman.  As for Iran, I think America has no constitutional right to levy sanations against Iran. My disdane for Israel certainly guides my opinion on the matter and I hope Iran gets the bomb and nukes Israel.  The common core thing is a red herring for neocons. Red meat, low hanging fruit. It's basically a final push to corporatize education. Which liberals seem to support as a proxy fight with neocons.  Neocons are also trolled into supporting blatantly stupid economic policy decisions because the left attacks capitalism so much that all nuance has all but evaporated. I support capitalism but I oppose much of what Wall St does. Wall St is as much capitalist as Stalin is Communist. It bears some resemblance to the original ideology but much is changed.  The bigger problem with mobility in our economic is that we are moving from a manufacturing economy to a service enonomy. Neocons have utterly failed us by letting Eall St export manufacturing jobs. More about this subject can be found in Avllvin Tollfer's book Power Shift. Basing an entire economy on energy production and export is always gonna end in disaster.

It leaves out important context in order to ensure the reader doesn't get to understand the situation or make up their own mind about it.  Figures, the source does seem to be a partisan propaganda shop.  CNN's not great, but they did a much better job covering this:  http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/08/politics/hillary-clinton-benghazi-subpoena-gowdy/  Here's something this freebeacon article left out:   Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill told CNN that Clinton understood the question to be if she was under subpoena when the emails were deleted, this past December.  ""The suggestion was made that a subpoena was pending at the time. That was not accurate,"" he said on Wednesday.  ""In fact, Trey Gowdy did not issue a subpoena until March, months after she she'd done that review. Further, the subpoena was specifically asking for documents pertaining to Libya and the attacks on our facility in Benghazi, documents which, along with tens of thousands of others, she had already given to the Department of State,"" Merrill said.   If you look at the actual question and answer in context, on the one hand it's true that she said ""I never had a subpoena"", but on he other hand it seems very likely that she was actually saying ""I had never had a subpoena at the time you're asking about it"", and it's perfectly plausible to interpret what she said that way.

AmericanPolitics,3cdzxd,pateras,0,Tue Jul 7 04:20:41 2015 UTC,"I really really really want reason #1 to be true. I'm struggling to remain skeptical what with the crowds Bernie is drawing. I've got no problem being doubtful about the other reasons though.   #2 reminds me of people saying in 2008 that Hillary Clinton was too divisive for the general election because she would bring out the knives of her Republican detractors. Yet somehow the GOP attack dogs weren't kept leashed when Barrack Obama was the nominee. The endless history of pseudo(and real)-scandals aren't a negative for Ms Clinton. If Senator Sanders becomes the nominee the unrelenting hostile scrutiny will turn on him and there will be new and different scandals for the media to report and people to consider.   I also don't think the charge of nepotism is such a slam dunk. Mrs Clinton isn't the daughter of a president she formed a partnership with a man and together they made it to the White House. The advantages that come from that are from her own blood, sweat, and tears. I think the Clinton campaign is laying in the weeds on this one waiting for it to be brought up in debate so she can hammer home the point that wives deserve credit for their families' success. This could solidify support with women. (And women's issues aren't identity politics.)   I do think that Bernie can make a better populist argument against the GOP nominee but I really don't think electability should be a factor in the Democratic primary. The GOP primary is just brutal for the electability of their nominees. The ""Blue Wall"" is really just voter reaction to the reactionary rhetoric Republicans have to repeat to become the nominee."
AmericanPolitics,3cdzxd,yo2sense,-1,Tue Jul 7 07:07:44 2015 UTC,"The economy is doing well right now, and seems to be headed in the right direction. Voters will be looking for continuity. Clinton is the candidate of the status quo, and she will crush any Republican on the economic front. Sanders is the candidate who's vulnerable on this front, since he's a change candidate.  The political winds are also favorable for Clinton on social issues. Sanders holds similar positions on most of these issues, but hasn't built the same level of trust with women and ethnic minorities.  Sanders' view on trade has some populist appeal, but virtually every mainstream economist, including left-leaning economists like Paul Krugman, says that Sanders is wrong on trade. That will cost Sanders a lot of swing voters. The main reason we keep entering into free trade deals is that voters keep electing the candidates that support them.  The Republicans' only shot against Clinton is to make the election into a referendum on immigration and on Obama's conciliatory posture on foreign policy. Sanders is vulnerable on other fronts, his immigration position is similar to Clinton's, and his foreign policy is more dovish than Clinton's.  So Clinton is clearly the more electable candidate on the issues. There are also factors like fundraising to consider, and the fact that Sanders is an easier target for those who will try to paint any Democratic nominee as the reincarnation of Vladimir Lenin.   I really don't think electability should be a factor in the Democratic primary.   If Clinton gets elected, we'll get a boost in minimum wage, immigration reform, salary reform, fully funded Obamacare, etc. Most of that goes in the wrong direction if a Republican gets elected, and a Republican could lock in a conservative Supreme Court for another generation. I'd say electability should be the #1 factor in the Democratic primary."

And Peter Schiff? Really? I can't remember a single article of his that didn't predict economic disaster. He successfully predicted the crash of '08, but unsuccessfully predicted the crashes of '05, '06, '07, '09, '10, '11, '12, '13, and '14. He's the broken watch who is correct twice a day.   Where would this country's GDP be if it weren't for QE infintum?   Good point. I'm certainly glad Bernanke and Yellen were smart enough to continue Quantitative Easing even as the doomsayers were telling them that it would lead to hyperinflation.   Inflation is artificially low due to the Fed keeping interest rates near or below zero.   You clearly don't know how that works. Low interest rates lead to higher inflation, which is why interest rates are starting to rise right now. They're not ""artificially"" low. They're low because the Fed wanted to avoid a deflationary cycle. The fact that inflation did not rise during the period of low interest rates shows that interest rates were set correctly.   people still have a hard time getting loans.   Banks are more reluctant to lend after the Bush bubble burst and nearly bankrupted them. Loans are easier to get now that the economy has improved."

Clinton is the candidate of the status quo, and she will crush any Republican on the economic front. Sanders is the candidate who's vulnerable on this front, since he's a change candidate.   Americans aren't exactly enamored with the status quo. The last polling I saw was 43% who thought the economy was improving versus 50% who thought things were getting worse. Most people don't care about GDP. They care about jobs. I'd say being the continuity candidate is a disadvantage.    The political winds are also favorable for Clinton on social issues. Sanders holds similar positions on most of these issues, but hasn't built the same level of trust with women and ethnic minorities.   I think you make a good point about the relationship Ms Clinton has established with women and blacks but there are other social issues that favor Senator Sanders. He hasn't flipped on gay marriage, for instance, and while he isn't making a point of it yet he opposes the drug war which gives him appeal with young people and blacks.    Sanders' view on trade has some populist appeal, but virtually every mainstream economist, including left-leaning economists like Paul Krugman, says that Sanders is wrong on trade. That will cost Sanders a lot of swing voters. The main reason we keep entering into free trade deals is that voters keep electing the candidates that support them.   The election isn't likely to turn on the mainstream economist demographic and among the rest of America free trade is deeply unpopular. Post an article here in favor and see what reaction you get from both sides of the aisle. The main reason we keep entering into free trade deals is because there is a lot of money to be made for elites and American politics are amazingly corrupt.    The Republicans' only shot against Clinton is to make the election into a referendum on immigration and on Obama's conciliatory posture on foreign policy. Sanders is vulnerable on other fronts, his immigration position is similar to Clinton's, and his foreign policy is more dovish than Clinton's.   I don't think the GOP is going to want to talk about immigration. In fact, I figure their candidates being forced to come out strongly against immigration in the primary is going to hurt them in the general election. And after the Bush wars where we still have troops most Americans aren't looking for an activist foreign policy. The warmongers can be ignored because they were never going to vote Democratic anyways.    So Clinton is clearly the more electable candidate on the issues.    Clearly that is incorrect. Whether or not she is is very much in dispute . I've pointed out the flaws I find with your reasoning moreover you have completely ignored the article we are discussing most of which is devoted to arguments for opposite conclusion.    There are also factors like fundraising to consider, and the fact that Sanders is an easier target for those who will try to paint any Democratic nominee as the reincarnation of Vladimir Lenin.   I think fundraising is a good point. If Bernie Sanders were to become the Democratic nominee he could expect things to open up for him on that front but the GOP candidate would still have far greater resources.   I think trying to paint Senator Sanders as a commie is not going to work on those who don't watch Fox News. The tactic relies on the target not having the opportunity to defend himself. That's not the case here. If Republican surrogates start pushing this talking point then the media will start asking Bernie and his staff about it and they get to talk about income inequality and the decline of the middle class. You know, the heart of his campaign. The more people hear Senator Sanders speak the more they like him. Even some Republicans.    I'd say electability should be the #1 factor in the Democratic primary.   My point was that the Republican primary is so full of crazy voters that their nominee will be severely damaged by the wacky right-wing stuff he'll have to say. Saying that this or that Democratic candidate will have the advantage in the general election isn't much of an argument since all Democrats will have an electoral advantage. It seems to me that people should support the Democrat they really like. If you think Hillary Clinton would make a better president then vote for her. If not, not."

I think you're right there. My point is that Sanders gains no advantage over Clinton on this issue.  My prediction is that the Republican nominee will try to stay away from this issue until late in the election season, then try to make it an issue toward the end in an act of desperation.   you have completely ignored the article   I haven't. I've pointed out that the economy is doing well, which is the opposite of what's being said in the article. In fact, the assertion that the current state of the economy is intolerable to most is plainly wrong. If it were intolerable, then Clinton, the candidate of continuity, would not be leading Sanders and every Republican in the polls.  People like it when unemployment is low. They like it when inflation is low, and when wages are rising faster than inflation. They're OK with other people doing well, as long as their own prospects remain good.  The author dismisses ""social issues"" as being either irrelevant or counterproductive, and I pointed out that these issues give Clinton a big advantage. And by the way, I think it's hugely counterproductive for Sanders when his supporters blithely dismiss the concerns of women, gays and ethnic minorities.    Saying that this or that Democratic candidate will have the advantage in the general election isn't much of an argument since all Democrats will have an electoral advantage.   I don't think that the Democrats are as locked in as you seem to. Obama won by only a few percentage points against McCain, a weak candidate, and Romney, a fairly mediocre campaigner. I think Sanders is significantly more vulnerable than Clinton, and I don't think that the relatively small policy differences between them are worth the risk."

AmericanPolitics,3cbdpq,monkeydeluxe,4,Mon Jul 6 16:19:25 2015 UTC,"This article is poorly laid out. If the point is to differentiate between libertarian and liberal preferences then they should stick to issues where these approaches differ. Why is the authors even bringing up gay rights, marijuana, immigration, and interracial marriage? It only clouds the issue.   So what issues do the authors bring up where there is actual disagreement between libertarians and liberals?  That would be guns, economic policy, and federal power. Now we see why the article shoehorned in those useless issues. Otherwise the article would be very thin. Yes, without a doubt Americans are growing more attached to our guns. And people are becoming more distrustful of government in general, not surprising given how the federal government has been lurching from one GOP-manufactured crisis to the next. But that doesn't necessarily mean that people are more likely to believe government action is illegitimate. Look at Obamacare polling. The program itself was under water but it's specific provisions had majority support. Consumers of Fox News may bemoan Social Security but they still cash their checks every month.   What about the facets of the issues that this pro-libertarian piece doesn't bring up? Free trade is part of economic policy and the authors don't provide any polling on that. Maybe because more and more Americans are realizing it's a bad deal for America? What about the growing support for increasing taxes on the wealthy? Does that indicate the nation is becoming more libertarian rather than more liberal?  The truth is that America is constantly changing in complex ways. There are always stats you can cherry pick to show it is changing in the way you want it to. That's all these authors have done. This article is merely a slightly clever bit of wishful thinking."
