If anything, most animators sex them up too much. I know the term is fan service, but there are other ways to do that besides something that leaves older viewers feeling somewhat creepy.  I should add that K-On! never did that. One of the reasons I love this show is it's innocence. Non Non Biyori and Repeat, too."
k_on,3e0thv,10TailBeast,7,Tue Jul 21 07:05:31 2015 UTC,"This is why K-On! quickly became my favorite anime. Its very cute and happy, but never made their characters into fap material."

k_on,3du6ow,NiSs4n,4,Sun Jul 19 16:43:39 2015 UTC,One of my favorite scenes. Ritsu got knocked the fuck out.
k_on,3du6ow,treeman798,4,Sun Jul 19 15:03:21 2015 UTC,She fought hard tho. RIP Yui
k_on,3du6ow,NiSs4n,3,Sun Jul 19 15:46:26 2015 UTC,Yui had that 5 star cop rating... Fuck they have aim bot I swear.
k_on,3du6ow,treeman798,3,Sun Jul 19 15:48:00 2015 UTC,Probably because she was pointing this at them.
k_on,3du6ow,10TailBeast,2,Sun Jul 19 15:50:56 2015 UTC,"Haha I could tell what it was before I even opened it. Yui's a straight up gangsta, rivaling the likes of Mugi even."
k_on,3du6ow,NiSs4n,2,Sun Jul 19 15:54:05 2015 UTC,"Nah, Yui could have just bumped into one and gotten that rating, followed by an entire military division being called out."
k_on,3du6ow,10TailBeast,3,Sun Jul 19 16:50:57 2015 UTC,She can deal with them.
k_on,3du6ow,NiSs4n,2,Sun Jul 19 17:04:36 2015 UTC,"The mass faceplant scene right after that makes me laugh. Also, did anyone ever notice the HTT on the concert poster that gets torn down and replaced with a wanted poster? Don't blink or you'll miss it.  In case someone doesn't know what the deal is, Sawako didn't give them the name Houkago Tea Time until several episodes later."
k_on,3du6ow,10TailBeast,2,Sun Jul 19 17:06:59 2015 UTC,Still had sony vegas open with the scene.  (I don't get why imgur cuts frames)
k_on,3du6ow,NiSs4n,2,Sun Jul 19 17:18:09 2015 UTC,"Is that the date on it? 3009?! Damn, the girls look great for being 1000 years old."

k_on,3du17s,The_Kuroi_Kenshi,2,Sun Jul 19 14:43:37 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'd be sure to remember next time!

k_on,3dsw3x,gulagmann,2,Sun Jul 19 19:13:41 2015 UTC,You are incredible. Thank you so much for actually fulfilling my ridiculous request.
k_on,3dsls9,1tobedoneX,9,Sun Jul 19 01:38:08 2015 UTC,"r/k_on right now  Clearly the better girl won, they should know better than to go up against Mugi. She's our heavyweight and has destroyed souls in the past."

k_on,3dsls9,treeman798,7,Sun Jul 19 03:27:18 2015 UTC,"Did this thread get down vote brigaded or some shit? Jeez people take waifus seriously. Well, then again I would take Ritsu and Jun to the grave."
k_on,3dsls9,gulagmann,5,Sun Jul 19 03:54:46 2015 UTC,"I think someone got a bit upset by my post, perhaps I overdid it a little bit."

k_on,3dsls9,gulagmann,6,Sun Jul 19 03:00:05 2015 UTC,I can taste the salt.
k_on,3dsls9,TheUltimateTeigu,0,Sun Jul 19 03:16:13 2015 UTC,Before that comment the salt wasn't even there...
k_on,3dsls9,inDude,2,Sun Jul 19 13:58:29 2015 UTC,"I don't like salt in my tea...   (All jokes aside , best girl won ! )"

It's /r/anime, which I've found to be the worst possible place on the internet for fans with more than half a brain.  *What I meant is that /r/anime is basically just waifu wars. And I'm kinda sick of seeing this contest plastered over all anime-related subs. Then people want to go into other people's subs and brag about their respective girl winning. /r/k_on is indeed a place of love and tea, but not when we are trying to rub 'salt' into others' imaginary wounds."
k_on,3dsls9,gulagmann,5,Sun Jul 19 03:01:02 2015 UTC,"Lets not start throwing insults here, /r/k_on is a place of love and tea.     Yes it is silly but a little funny too, at least I thought so.     Ultimately these brackets are entirely pointless and driven by popularity or sheer luck, nothing to get upset about."

Oh, I agree, and I'm not upset. I'm just trying to convey using a Peter Griffin gif that these threads and everything surrounding that contest is, like you said, pointless.  Going to other subs and rubbing in some 'victory' is not the way to internet."
k_on,3dsls9,28486440,2,Sun Jul 19 03:28:04 2015 UTC,"It's an annual ritual already. When k-ons lose there will be a crowd of hipsters with the same ""moeshit running the industry"" speech. And the similar for every other shows."

k_on,3dsls9,28486440,2,Sun Jul 19 11:06:10 2015 UTC,It's decent enough if you like action as much as you like moe.  Also plot. There's tons of it.
k_on,3dsls9,RobloxGirlClone,2,Sun Jul 19 02:34:45 2015 UTC,"I understand they're bitter about it.  But it's the same every year in every kind of popularity contest. Favorite girls/show lose, fandom displeased, hatedoms or ""too hipster to like it"" kind of people double down on that, rinse and repeat every round.  It happened when k-on characters lost in saimoe too. It also happened with other shows I like.  I vote for fun, but stopped paying attention to all that drama, especially the ""why did she lose instead of another"" part. It's contagious and doesn't help dispel the creepy image of anime fans."

Should I?  Sorry about the whole contest making everyone upset, but trust me, it's for fun, not drama."

k_on,3dsls9,RobloxGirlClone,3,Sun Jul 19 02:45:14 2015 UTC,"I mean ""fun"" as reading horoscopes and bad daily omen, not having dreams crushed. Again, sorry about it. I'll make sure to check out Fairy Tale by the way. It must be good, right?"
k_on,3dsls9,28486440,2,Sun Jul 19 02:53:33 2015 UTC,Y-yeah...  It fantastic.  eyebrow twitches
k_on,3dsls9,RobloxGirlClone,3,Sun Jul 19 02:54:29 2015 UTC,"That's the attitude. Now, sub or dub for Fairy Tale?"
k_on,3dsls9,28486440,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:57:21 2015 UTC,"The entire first season is dubbed, while the second season is started to be dubbed. By the way, it's spelled Fairy Tail"

k_on,3dsls9,RobloxGirlClone,2,Sun Jul 19 14:58:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I give credit to you.  Also, sorry about that."

k_on,3dt8nb,treeman798,5,Sun Jul 19 05:56:26 2015 UTC,"Tagged as discussion because we can discuss this.  Me using the /u/User_Simulator bot, and farming it's ridiculous statement for karma.  About 90% of my comments consist of K-On posts and I'm damn proud of it.  Edit: and if I spawn a bunch of these posts which I probably won't we can use this post to contain them if needed."
k_on,3dt8nb,gulagmann,4,Sun Jul 19 05:57:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'll latch onto the top comment to say the following:  Keep all discussion and such about this in this thread. It's only vaguely K-ON!-related, so it'd be better if the front page isn't spammed with these sorts of posts.    I'll look into getting a Ton-chan bot set up, but I'm not too sure on how often and where it'll comment. It'll be a Markov chain of all the comments in this subreddit. I'd rather not make it summonable, since that'd just make half the comments in this sub summoning Ton-chan. How about once every 3 hours, on a random front-page submission as a top-level comment?"
k_on,3dt8nb,UltimateEpicFailz,2,Sun Jul 19 08:57:19 2015 UTC,"I thought it would only post in /r/SubredditSimulator, since it seemed like you could request bots for certain subs in there.     But if you want to play god and make a robot, you can do that too. What you said sounds perfectly fine if that's the case, though having it post just once a day would be fine as well."
k_on,3dt8nb,gulagmann,2,Sun Jul 19 10:06:04 2015 UTC,"I can definitely suggest that a /u/k_on_SS bot be made for /r/SubredditSimulator, but I honestly doubt it'll be implemented because of us being a small sub.  I think it'd be fun to implement one here, but I need to try my best to make sure it doesn't spam, or take focus from the actual content and discussion posted to /r/k_on daily.  What'd be a good name for it? /u/Ton-chan? /u/Ton-chan_bot?  EDIT: It'd be /u/k_on_SS, not /u/k_on-SS. Double underscore, ew."
k_on,3dt8nb,gulagmann,3,Sun Jul 19 10:12:23 2015 UTC,"I'd love /u/Ton-chan straight up! And your robot idea sounds more fun so whatever, screw the simulator! #TonChan2015 #RobotTomodachi #YesWeChan  Woo, I'm excited for it."
k_on,3dt8nb,gulagmann,2,Sun Jul 19 10:51:27 2015 UTC,"I take it /r/SubredditSimulator is similar to this, if only we had a bot there - it would be majestic.     It'd be like having a pet, IT'D BE LIKE TON-CHAN."

k_on,3dr3dj,Bill_the_Pony,4,Sat Jul 18 17:19:50 2015 UTC,In the thumbnail the jacket looks like an incredibly buff arm.
k_on,3dr3dj,Furirukangaru,3,Sat Jul 18 22:08:23 2015 UTC,Wouldn't be surprised. It is Mugi after all.
k_on,3dr3dj,NiSs4n,2,Sat Jul 18 23:01:07 2015 UTC,I'm really enjoying these. That style is awesome.
k_on,3dr90v,VeloxRdt,3,Sat Jul 18 18:09:39 2015 UTC,SOURCE
k_on,3dr90v,treeman798,3,Sat Jul 18 18:10:02 2015 UTC,Well Sawako was right... she really can pull off the bunny ears quite well.
k_on,3drvaf,10TailBeast,4,Sat Jul 18 21:22:48 2015 UTC,Um was it ganmodoki?
k_on,3drvaf,vMirrorrorriMv,4,Sat Jul 18 21:31:45 2015 UTC,"Yes it was. You guys are good. Ganmo would also have been accepted.  K-On! got me to do research on a lot of food, Japanese or otherwise."
k_on,3drvaf,NiSs4n,3,Sat Jul 18 21:32:38 2015 UTC,It looks tasty. It's the second time you're making me hungry.. I'm gonna grab my boring corn flakes.
k_on,3drvaf,treeman798,3,Sat Jul 18 21:59:04 2015 UTC,"haha Don't knock the corn flakes, man. My dinner consisted of boxed mac & cheese."
k_on,3drvaf,treeman798,2,Sat Jul 18 22:22:53 2015 UTC,Don't you just hate it when you cook the macaroni and then remember you're out of milk? The worst moment to remember that.
k_on,3drvaf,treeman798,3,Sat Jul 18 23:09:45 2015 UTC,"..............I had that happen one time and replaced the milk with more margarine. Yup, worst mac I ever had. Thankfully we have some 2% in the fridge."
k_on,3drvaf,vMirrorrorriMv,2,Sat Jul 18 23:11:33 2015 UTC,"Due to my brother being a vegan we had some other stuff. Needless to say I trashed it. I almost couldn't bring myself to do it I was so hungry, ended up ordering a pizza instead."
k_on,3dqkx2,The_Kuroi_Kenshi,3,Sat Jul 18 14:21:50 2015 UTC,"I wonder if she ever did act anything like this in middle school, or if she was always disciplined to be so in-line. Before she met the light music club she seemed boring, but as she got used to them she turned out to be a great character."
k_on,3dqkx2,treeman798,5,Sat Jul 18 14:34:04 2015 UTC,"Act like a 20cm tall cat girl? I wouldn't say she seemed boring just normal, especially with how crazy her first time in the keionbu was"
k_on,3dqkx2,VeloxRdt,3,Sat Jul 18 15:14:14 2015 UTC,"Well she was certainly more... not light music club-ish. I think you get what I mean, but it's basically established that she's not how she used to be before she met them I guess, NOTHING TO SEE HERE"
k_on,3dqkx2,treeman798,2,Sat Jul 18 15:21:03 2015 UTC,I imagine she was like that in kindergarten or elementary school towards her parents but changed after that? Lots of kids change around that age. Imagine mini azunyan clinging to her mommy and daddy.
k_on,3dqkw4,The_Kuroi_Kenshi,5,Sat Jul 18 14:21:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, I know. It's a car thing, but I can dream that it's a train."

k_on,3dqkw4,NiSs4n,6,Sat Jul 18 14:34:35 2015 UTC,The last time Ritsu led the way this happened.
k_on,3dqkw4,gulagmann,5,Sat Jul 18 14:40:11 2015 UTC,"Just a fluke, she would've found her way out if it wasn't for all the buildings in the way."
k_on,3dqkw4,NiSs4n,4,Sat Jul 18 14:46:38 2015 UTC,Damn buildings! What are they good for anyway?!
k_on,3dqkw4,treeman798,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:04:47 2015 UTC,"Only reinforces her as best girl  In relation to that scene, I loved the part where they find Nodoka and Ritsu thinks they've found their way out, only to be told she was lost too and Ritsu proceeds to face plant."
k_on,3dqkw4,NiSs4n,5,Sat Jul 18 14:42:03 2015 UTC,Same.
k_on,3dqkw4,treeman798,2,Sat Jul 18 14:45:48 2015 UTC,That's amazing. Do you just have every scene of the show in a folder of gifs? Show me the one scene where Mugi is 'nya-ing' as a cat next to Mio who's talking to the other members!
k_on,3dqkw4,NiSs4n,3,Sat Jul 18 14:47:51 2015 UTC,"I don't really have them in a folder, I just go by memory and make them but I took the Ritsu faceplant gif from the rewatch thread over at /r/HTT. My brain is failing right now, I don't remember the scene with Mugi nyaing T_T"
k_on,3dqkw4,treeman798,2,Sat Jul 18 15:02:57 2015 UTC,"Ah that's a shame. I think it's the episode with the Light Music Club sandwich, where Azusa asks why she's the pig in the group. In one scene Azusa, Ritsu and Yui are chilling in the club room and then enters Mugi and Mio in their horse/cat costumes, and Mugi says something along the lines ""we were passing out some more flyers!"" And then she proceeds to do a little jazz - hand thing and she nya's while Mio talks over it. I thought it was an obscure scene which is exactly what I was trying to stump you with"
k_on,3dqkw4,NiSs4n,3,Sat Jul 18 15:06:39 2015 UTC,OH! You mean this one! I thought there was a scene where Mugi is wearing cat ears while she's nyaing.
k_on,3dqkw4,treeman798,2,Sat Jul 18 15:11:07 2015 UTC,"Yes! I guess I was a little vague in my post, but that's great. Thanks."

She must be quite the handful for Mio I swear, but I guess that's why we love her and Yui so. They're a handful but they're not our handful."
k_on,3dqkxm,treeman798,3,Sat Jul 18 14:26:22 2015 UTC,"Very cute, the Ritsu daily is already a huge success.     It's like the planets are aligned, angels are singing, the world is a bit better now that there's a Ritsu daily."

k_on,3dr520,Aeromancer,3,Sun Jul 19 00:40:38 2015 UTC,Just draft on who you think would throw the best tea party. You may in fact find success.

k_on,3dp1po,treeman798,6,Sat Jul 18 02:16:47 2015 UTC,"As a Ritsu advocate, you've done very well. I love the everything about it, and encapsulates her personality really well. The laid back buy ready to take on any situation look."
k_on,3dp1po,gulagmann,3,Sat Jul 18 02:31:25 2015 UTC,You said exactly what I wanted to say. Especially how she looks cute now but the next moment who knows what she'll do.     I quite like the style of it too.

k_on,3dofwp,VeloxRdt,7,Fri Jul 17 22:56:38 2015 UTC,"Aw man I love all the rainy scenes in K-On, especially the one where Ui is hanging with Jun and Azusa. Rain always has the best atmosphere. I just love the rain in general but it seems to be a pretty unpopular opinion."
k_on,3dofwp,treeman798,2,Fri Jul 17 23:31:03 2015 UTC,"especially the one where Ui is hanging with Jun and Azusa   I love this episode ❤️, it's just so relaxing to watch. I think my favorite scene is all of them in the bathroom sharing the toothpaste, and Jun having to squeeze really hard to get it out."
k_on,3dofwp,AlexMeanberg,2,Sun Jul 19 05:31:07 2015 UTC,"Oh man I know what you mean. I love Jun's determination to get that last bit out only to just say 'ah fuck it' and go for the new tube. That's why Jun is my second favorite, her determination as well as her playful personality and great hair."
k_on,3dofwp,treeman798,2,Sun Jul 19 05:33:07 2015 UTC,"Jun and her frizzy hair are the best. I wish all the side-characters had more screen time. Nodoka is so fantastic, but she hardly got any screen time at all.  An episode that has all the side-characters perspectives would have been awesome."
k_on,3dofwp,AlexMeanberg,2,Sun Jul 19 05:41:59 2015 UTC,"Jun definitely deserves more screentime, especially since she didn't even have a personality in all of season 1 she was in. Nodoka is my 2nd favorite side character as well, and having seen the school years through her perspective would've been awesome. Taking on the student council, hanging out with Yui, more of her past, that'd be great. Also I only just realized, besides Mugi, Jun is the only character we don't learn the past of. Although even with Mugi, I hear in the manga it shows that someone gave her yuri manga as a kid."
k_on,3dofwp,treeman798,2,Sun Jul 19 05:45:02 2015 UTC,"Although even with Mugi, I hear in the manga it shows that someone gave her yuri manga as a kid.   I haven't read all the manga yet, but I remember Mugi's yuri-ism being way more intense, I guess they toned it down for the anime.  One of my favorite episodes is episode 8 the second season, with Yui and Nodoka as kindergarteners. They totally missed the opportunity to talk more about Nodoka's past. :/  (Octopus-free takoyaki)"
k_on,3dofwp,AlexMeanberg,2,Sun Jul 19 05:54:24 2015 UTC,"Aw man yeah, pre-glasses Nodoka. The glasses fit her really well, but it's always interesting to see that some people never needed glasses from the get go (like myself)"

k_on,3dmgkc,treeman798,5,Fri Jul 17 14:22:20 2015 UTC,God damn Ritsu as a child is the cutest fucking thing. Especially pineapple Ritsu.

k_on,3dmhi1,gulagmann,3,Fri Jul 17 15:08:02 2015 UTC,"I also expected to see him here , it seems like he's still sleeping ..."
k_on,3dmhi1,gulagmann,3,Fri Jul 17 15:17:06 2015 UTC,"Him right now.     Seeing Jun in a Yukata, he'll be thinking he's still dreaming."
k_on,3dmhi1,treeman798,3,Fri Jul 17 16:23:58 2015 UTC,Shit you guys are great. To be honest... I was still asleep. This post is fantastic though as are you guys.  Edit:just noticed the Super All Star Donuts on her yukata... that's awesome.
k_on,3dmhi1,gulagmann,3,Fri Jul 17 17:57:09 2015 UTC,"Her yukata is really sweet in more ways than one.    You're great too, we're all great here!"

Ritsu is going strong but I know some powerhouse is gonna get more votes just because their anime is more popular.  Doesn't matter. To me Ritsu always wins, even when she loses."
k_on,3dma6s,gulagmann,2,Fri Jul 17 13:20:29 2015 UTC,"It's /r/anime. You can expect someone from Nisekoi or Monogatari to win.  I never really pay attention to these contests, but it's interesting to see how far dark horse characters go."

k_on,3dma6s,gulagmann,2,Fri Jul 17 16:59:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, people tend to vote for shows they've seen so the most popular show is bound to have the winning character."

k_on,3djz8a,treeman798,4,Thu Jul 16 22:05:02 2015 UTC,Ah man you can't help but love Jun with her donuts. I thought it was the cutest thing when she took a bite out of each one of them. That's right I'm derailing this into a Jun thread. All aboard!
k_on,3djz8a,gulagmann,6,Thu Jul 16 23:13:21 2015 UTC,"You don't just derail, you build a new track and a station and I'm right there with you delivering the materials."
k_on,3djz8a,treeman798,2,Fri Jul 17 01:08:09 2015 UTC,Oh shit. Maybe we could set up a whole Jun subreddit... only thing is I know it wouldn't be too popular and I'm in no position to run a reddit... but thanks for the Jun man.
k_on,3djz8a,gulagmann,3,Fri Jul 17 01:11:19 2015 UTC,"Jun know what, that'd be great. We should do that when Season 3 is announced, Wakaba Girls gets popular, we strike and our Jun sub becomes Juntaculary filled with Junraiders.  No problem, once I do a rewatch I'll try to make more gifs of everyone including Jun."
k_on,3djz8a,treeman798,2,Fri Jul 17 01:41:58 2015 UTC,"I salute you, for your great ideas and you dedication to Jun. We shall take over in time. Maybe not next week... maybe not next month. Shit, maybe not next year. But mark my words. We will have Jun in the spotlight."

k_on,3dk6gg,gulagmann,3,Thu Jul 16 23:51:41 2015 UTC,Do you have a cat called Azunyan #2 as well? How much did all of that cost?
k_on,3dk6gg,NiSs4n,3,Fri Jul 17 01:07:17 2015 UTC,Oh man! I would totaly have a cat named Azunyan if I wasn't allergic. :s
k_on,3dk6gg,UWaffle,3,Fri Jul 17 01:22:31 2015 UTC,"If I ever get my own cat I will most certainly call it that! In total including shipping everything in the picture cost me roughly £120, but I also have some non-figure merch which cost about about £60, and I pre-ordered this last year which cost £70 and should arrive in the coming months."
k_on,3dk6gg,gulagmann,3,Fri Jul 17 01:24:40 2015 UTC,"That's a lot of money.  That pre-order looks cool, you should make another post when you get it."

k_on,3dippg,IZFSLE_,3,Thu Jul 16 16:21:20 2015 UTC,"I will pay someone a hundred imaginary dollars if they swap Mio and Ritsu.     This looks cool though, I wonder what Mugi and Yui are doing."
k_on,3dippg,gulagmann,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:59:24 2015 UTC,Ritsu deserves to be the star for every episode. Season 3 needs to be just Ritsu. Satoshi can make 1 cameo.
k_on,3dippg,treeman798,2,Thu Jul 16 17:30:06 2015 UTC,"Hahaha, maybe a 12 episode long OVA series with Ritsu doing different things, 4 of those should have Mugi as well."
k_on,3dippg,gulagmann,2,Thu Jul 16 18:06:40 2015 UTC,And Jun!
k_on,3dippg,treeman798,2,Thu Jul 16 18:07:02 2015 UTC,"You know I always thought Jun should look up to Ritsu, they would probably have some cool chemistry together. I can't remember if they ever really interacted with each others though, guess it's time to do a rewatch soon."
k_on,3dippg,gulagmann,2,Thu Jul 16 18:10:38 2015 UTC,I think the only interaction she had directly with a Light music club member was with Mio during the marathon. Even then Azusa and Ui were there. Jun and Ritsu would totally be awesome together.
k_on,3dippg,treeman798,2,Thu Jul 16 18:11:52 2015 UTC,"Speaking of Ritsu, she's said to be the most athletic one but we never get to really see it. She didn't really seem any better at running than the other girls from what I can remember. If we get College, I hope they expand on that - I'd love to see her kick some ass."
k_on,3dippg,gulagmann,2,Thu Jul 16 18:24:39 2015 UTC,Oh totally! Maybe beat up some muggers or something. K-On doesn't seem like it would be fit for it or it would be out of place but I'd love it a ton.
k_on,3dippg,treeman798,2,Thu Jul 16 18:27:13 2015 UTC,"""Give us your hat Mugi! Or else we hurt Yui!"" Ritsu steps forward ""Yare yare daze."" ""You don't look so tough hairband girl!"" ""Teme yaro, STAR RITSINIUM! ORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORA"" and Ritsu saves the day.      Ritsu's Bizarre Adventure: Hairband Crusaders starts airing on August 3rd, 2015."

k_on,3dj81k,Nightshot,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:46:30 2015 UTC,"I agree but I just don't think it fits Ritsu to put that little effort into someone she cares about, she puts the people close to her above anything else."
k_on,3dj81k,gulagmann,3,Fri Jul 17 01:53:57 2015 UTC,Can I just have Mugi be my present?
k_on,3dj81k,Nightshot,2,Fri Jul 17 01:41:49 2015 UTC,Mugi's is probably the best... but Ritsu went to the trouble to even... get... something? Mio probably smacked Ritsu for not even wrapping hers.
k_on,3dj81k,treeman798,2,Thu Jul 16 23:19:50 2015 UTC,"Mugi's gift is either, like, jewelry that has a matching set worn by the royal family of Belgium... or a pack of wipes that restore the shine to your faucets."
k_on,3dj81k,kjs309,2,Thu Jul 16 23:56:40 2015 UTC,I wouldn't want to disappoint any of them!

k_on,3dhjrg,10TailBeast,2,Thu Jul 16 09:22:13 2015 UTC,"Well, how does everyone like the way I did today's question? Is it better? Also, /u/kjs309 brings up a good point. Should I mark spoilers in the title?"
k_on,3dhjrg,kjs309,2,Thu Jul 16 19:53:55 2015 UTC,"Oh that wasn't my intent, I'm totally fine with however you choose to handle this! Thanks for taking care of this contest :D"
k_on,3dhjrg,UltimateEpicFailz,2,Thu Jul 16 23:06:36 2015 UTC,"I like it! Separate threads means people will check them more often, and posting it in the comments for people to reply to is a much better way of organising the comments.  Both of those seem like two different solutions to the same problem, though - why not keep the singular thread and post the new question in the comments, or why not simply have the question in the body of the new thread? Doing both a comment and a new thread seems unnecessary IMO."
k_on,3dhjrg,kjs309,2,Thu Jul 16 20:15:31 2015 UTC,"why not simply have the question in the body of the new thread?   I'll do that tomorrow. I'll go back to striking through the older, answered questions."

k_on,3dfw38,gulagmann,6,Thu Jul 16 01:00:41 2015 UTC,"Everyone here is interested in discussing K-On! The movie is indeed pretty great, it's different from the anime while still being all the same in a very good way.     I think it's great that you've decided to make a band, being creative is something you can do at any moment in your life but you still don't want to miss a second of doing it.     If you're planning on writing lyrics remember to keep a notebook with you at all times, you never know when inspiration might strike.  Now feel free to join us in the suffering wait that is Season 3."
k_on,3dfw38,NiSs4n,2,Thu Jul 16 00:11:57 2015 UTC,"I mostly said it because I had a lot of personal thinking in the post. I'm pretty new here so I wasn't sure if people cared.  I've always made music solo and always bragged about it when I talked to people in bands since whatever I wanted to make music wise was what I would do.  But K-on! also made me realise that I like a lot of music, not just electronic music.  So I'm looking forward to move out of my comfort zone and try something new!"
k_on,3dfw38,gulagmann,3,Thu Jul 16 00:31:18 2015 UTC,"Good, try everything. Go out there and make your music, don't let your dreams be dreams - just, do it."
k_on,3dfw38,treeman798,4,Thu Jul 16 00:49:31 2015 UTC,"just, do it.   I expected something else"

k_on,3dfw38,dcresistance,3,Wed Jul 15 23:41:51 2015 UTC,It captured the spirit of K-on really well! Glad to hear people thought the same as me.
k_on,3dfw38,guislavi,5,Thu Jul 16 00:28:25 2015 UTC,"I love the movie a lot, even if the English dub ruins some of the jokes... But I actually think it would be cool to see them go to more places."

k_on,3ddulo,Yeti_otaku,10,Wed Jul 15 14:27:39 2015 UTC,"Shortly after this, she fell over and got very embarrassed - again.     Good choice for starting off the Mio daily."
k_on,3ddulo,gulagmann,9,Wed Jul 15 15:14:48 2015 UTC,Daily Mio Hype !
k_on,3ddulo,inDude,9,Wed Jul 15 15:31:28 2015 UTC,"Well we got everyone now, great that you're starting this!"
k_on,3ddulo,259tim,6,Wed Jul 15 15:49:36 2015 UTC,"Everyone? Hardly, we're missing a daily for squad leader Ritsu, and it's sad. So sad. It's a sad sad situation."
k_on,3ddulo,gulagmann,5,Wed Jul 15 16:51:51 2015 UTC,"Hey,  come on over to /r/tainakaritsu ! You're always welcome. Also we are forgetting Ui, Jun, Nodoka and Sawako to have everyone..."
k_on,3ddulo,treeman798,5,Wed Jul 15 18:16:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I know about the sub, I just disagree with some of the content so I stay in here but I'm glad it's active and seems to be growing at a good pace.      Well Ui, Jun, Nodoka and Sawa-chan are all side characters, but a daily of them as well would be very nice. Maybe if we build robots to draw OC for us.."
k_on,3ddulo,gulagmann,3,Wed Jul 15 18:30:05 2015 UTC,"Dude Jun deserves to be a primary character. She didn't get much screentime compared to Nodoka and Ui in season 2 (in season 1 she didn't even have a personality) and with Wakaba girls she would be promoted to such heights. Sorry if it's off topic but KyoAni pls, we beg you."
k_on,3ddulo,treeman798,6,Wed Jul 15 18:31:51 2015 UTC,"It's very on topic because this is /r/k_on and everything is already off topic, every time someone tries to have a mea- Oh tea! Oh a Mugi daily! This cake is great ... Ops I forgot where I was.     Anyway Wakaba Girls, I would really love to see that! It sounds like so much fun and a whole new gang means whole new shenanigans, whole new cakes, whole new gifs, whole new sounds funny now."
k_on,3ddulo,gulagmann,5,Wed Jul 15 18:50:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I haven't read the manga or whatever myself so I don't know anything about the new characters, but 2 new characters and Jun+Ui as main characters would be rad as hell!"
k_on,3ddulo,treeman798,5,Wed Jul 15 18:52:32 2015 UTC,"I haven't read the manga either but how cool doesn't that sound, I really hope they make it eventually, there's still plenty of hope.     I wonder what their style is like, seeing as HTT has a very unique one it would be fun to compare them to Wakaba Girls, especially with Azusa having been a key member of both."
k_on,3ddulo,gulagmann,2,Wed Jul 15 19:01:58 2015 UTC,I second this ( ；∀；)
k_on,3ddulo,Digatz,2,Wed Jul 15 17:29:24 2015 UTC,"If I were Mio's classmate, I would be so distracted that my grades would fall..."

k_on,3de9f8,gulagmann,6,Wed Jul 15 16:48:07 2015 UTC,Further evidence supporting Ritsu a best
k_on,3de9f8,treeman798,4,Wed Jul 15 18:54:44 2015 UTC,Albert Einstein could tell me in person that two plus two equals four and you would still be more correct than he would've been.

k_on,3dds02,ScottFromCanada,5,Wed Jul 15 15:17:01 2015 UTC,"I love Mio's outfit so much. She had the best ones in the EDs in my opinion, except for Mugi in Listen!!"

k_on,3dds02,Emsalek,3,Wed Jul 15 18:07:57 2015 UTC,Whew. For a moment there I thought you didn't obey the title of the post but then I saw that you didn't capitalize the first letter like in the post. That was a close call! Carry on :)
k_on,3dds02,TheLazyBassist,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:12:40 2015 UTC,First thing I think whenever I see a picture like this? Needs more Azusa.
k_on,3ddn4q,The_Kuroi_Kenshi,5,Wed Jul 15 13:22:46 2015 UTC,"Mugi doesn't fit that outfit so much in my opinion, Azusa looks really cool though. All aboard the A.Z.U. Nyan, destination Wonderland."
k_on,3ddn4q,gulagmann,4,Wed Jul 15 15:01:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah she does seem out of place in it, although it looks ok. She would fit Yui's more in my opinion. Azusa looks great though."
k_on,3ddn4q,treeman798,3,Wed Jul 15 18:26:42 2015 UTC,"Which is odd right? Because Mugi usually pulls off anything, she tends to look gud in whatever, I'd love to see everyone in all the different outfits. Maybe one day I'll draw that myself, in about 6 million years."
k_on,3ddn4q,gulagmann,5,Wed Jul 15 18:40:34 2015 UTC,Totally! Even the sundress and pigtails and socks and sandals during summer classes looked good on her. I'd support you over all 6 million of those years.
k_on,3ddn4q,treeman798,3,Wed Jul 15 18:42:09 2015 UTC,"Even Azusa wants to be inside Mugi's dress. What? What do you mean that statement was biased?  Hmm... Azusa's outfit works pretty nicely with Mugi, but not nearly as well as her original dress. Mugi is all about being lovey-dovey soft and the hard black jacket and sailor hat added a really dynamic and well working contrast to that. Azusa's outfit on the other hand is very in line with her character with maybe a little bit more added youth. It's not that exciting, but still works. The outfit, I mean. Mugi always works. Great post, TKK!"
k_on,3df4hs,UltimateEpicFailz,6,Wed Jul 15 19:54:16 2015 UTC,"This has to be my favourite HTT song of all time. That bassline, that beat, that glorious Azusolo, it's all perfect. Excellent taste in shipfu by the way."
k_on,3df4hs,VeloxRdt,4,Wed Jul 15 20:57:26 2015 UTC,Oh wow Azusa thumbnail! Just good?! I think it would be perfect as an outro!for season 3 maybe?
k_on,3df4hs,NiSs4n,3,Wed Jul 15 20:03:01 2015 UTC,"(wow don't remember the scene)  A perfect song, 11 stars in its very own way. Bass.. rhythm... Personally, the chorus groove, easy-going sound caught me gloriously. Oh, and that kick-ass solo  Yeah, I mean it when I say I love the its sound"
k_on,3ddt45,Yeti_otaku,9,Wed Jul 15 14:15:45 2015 UTC,Bro. I got your back.

k_on,3ddt45,gulagmann,3,Wed Jul 15 14:47:13 2015 UTC,"I appreciate their effort over there but it's just not for me.     No one has made a Mio sub yet? I just checked /r/MoeMoeKyun and it doesn't exist, this is sad."
k_on,3ddt45,1whatevr,4,Wed Jul 15 15:05:49 2015 UTC,"Finally, it's about time the greatest girl gets the love she deserves."

k_on,3ddt45,TheLazyBassist,2,Wed Jul 15 16:24:55 2015 UTC,"Nice to see a new daily! Ritsu is still in need of a daily series. What if, in compensation for that, all the daily character image posters will choose one day to post a Ritsu image :)."
k_on,3ddt45,TheLazyBassist,2,Wed Jul 15 20:06:25 2015 UTC,About to go pm the rest of the daily posters about this idea and ill see what they have to say about this. I only have about 150 pics of ritsu so what ever.

k_on,3dcmyh,treeman798,3,Thu Jul 16 13:08:28 2015 UTC,This is awesome! I might want to request something else in a PM if you wouldn't mind too much later on. I'm just a little scared I sound a little selfish!
k_on,3dcmyh,satansnewbaby,3,Thu Jul 16 14:19:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks and don't feel that way! If you request it, everyone else will get to see it and it'll be shared around!    Though I might not be able to do as fast since work is just starting to get busy, but I'll do my best!"
k_on,3dcmyh,treeman798,3,Fri Jul 17 06:00:18 2015 UTC,Well I guess I'll take you up on your offer some time soon!

k_on,3dcmyh,treeman798,3,Wed Jul 15 23:25:57 2015 UTC,"I would love the first one please! As for the background, a lime green with crimson polka dots would be pretty sweet I think. Thanks for your time and effort!"
k_on,3dcmyh,VeloxRdt,6,Wed Jul 15 23:27:20 2015 UTC,I would use this as my wallpaper but I feel like I'd cry every time I saw it... Great work though!

k_on,3daqke,gulagmann,2,Wed Jul 15 05:27:59 2015 UTC,"I think you mean President of Za Warudo, we would be in good hands under the rule of Madam ""Iron Glasses"" Nodoka."

k_on,3d9rv9,1tobedoneX,2,Tue Jul 14 19:41:50 2015 UTC,B-but Ritsu and Mugi! Maybe they're... hanging out? I shipit
k_on,3d9rv9,treeman798,3,Tue Jul 14 17:08:19 2015 UTC,"I love that episode, so I'm all for it.     They have some great chemistry together."
k_on,3d9rv9,gulagmann,3,Tue Jul 14 17:32:35 2015 UTC,Dude its my favorite episode. They're both my favorite characters besides Jun ( if we could get an episode similar and slap Jun in the middle of it I would cry tears of joy )
k_on,3d9rv9,treeman798,2,Tue Jul 14 17:50:52 2015 UTC,Jun with whom maybe? Ui is too obvious.
k_on,3d9rv9,28486440,2,Wed Jul 15 01:11:56 2015 UTC,"Well I was thinking it'd be Ritsu and Mugi again, but with Jun there as well. We never got to see Jun interact with any of the light music club members all that much."
k_on,3d9rv9,treeman798,2,Wed Jul 15 01:14:36 2015 UTC,"That's true. I want to see her with Mio alone, knowing how much she admires her and all."
k_on,3d9rv9,28486440,2,Wed Jul 15 01:18:17 2015 UTC,"If there were to be a season 3 following the wakaba girls cough kyoani cough she'd be bumped up to a main character, which would be awesome, as she's one of my favorite as stated before."
k_on,3d9rv9,treeman798,2,Wed Jul 15 01:20:41 2015 UTC,"I was thinking a mini season from the Azusa's groups perspective would be nice. Starting from mid-season 2, Jun fantasizing about Mio and Mugi's fine activities, clashing with Yui and Ritsu munching cookies and being lazy. Seniors graduation and Ui's struggle to find her path without Yui. Azusa's desire to make a successful club, and if following the manga, her disappointment with her own performance at the freshmen welcoming party and how Sumire and Nao came to join them, etc."
k_on,3d9oif,Bill_the_Pony,3,Tue Jul 14 16:19:27 2015 UTC,"It's Mugi, adorable is a foregone conclusion."

k_on,3da448,UWaffle,3,Tue Jul 14 19:23:24 2015 UTC,"""16 Bit"" isn't a very good choice for artwork in my opinion, it just ends up looking like you added a mosaic filter, you should stick to ""8 Bit""."
k_on,3da448,gulagmann,2,Tue Jul 14 18:46:47 2015 UTC,"Will do, it seems more stylised!"
k_on,3da448,Nightshot,3,Tue Jul 14 19:11:32 2015 UTC,"More Bit Mugi, woo!"
k_on,3da448,NiSs4n,2,Tue Jul 14 21:42:08 2015 UTC,I like 8-bit more... are those spoons she's holding?
k_on,3da448,UltimateEpicFailz,2,Tue Jul 14 18:38:11 2015 UTC,"Fair enough! I tried leaving the detail in; I was mostly testing the waters. On the right is a spoon, a cloth is on the left! Anyways, thanks for the feedback!"
k_on,3da448,TheLazyBassist,2,Tue Jul 14 19:07:25 2015 UTC,"Please remember to flair your posts!  Don't worry, I've got your back this time!  Is one of those spoons for me?"
k_on,3d8tz9,The_Kuroi_Kenshi,7,Tue Jul 14 12:09:01 2015 UTC,"What proof do we have that it indeed was a cake that Ritsu ate? Maybe she was eating potato mush and she busted Azusa eating the cake, hence her holding the cat ears in her hand. Ritsu is in fact a hero."
k_on,3d8tz9,TheLazyBassist,3,Tue Jul 14 14:45:18 2015 UTC,Ritsu is gonna get smacked by Mio for the billionth time if she ain't careful
k_on,3d8tz9,treeman798,3,Tue Jul 14 16:38:02 2015 UTC,Ritsu Why?
k_on,3d8hib,stairsel69,3,Tue Jul 14 09:30:40 2015 UTC,Okay... so how do I use it?
k_on,3d8hib,NearNihil,2,Tue Jul 14 09:51:28 2015 UTC,"Same, hope I'm not just being stupid.  NVM I just looked at the bottom at the install."

k_on,3d8hib,SloppierKitty7,2,Tue Jul 14 12:10:41 2015 UTC,"Just want to say that this is pretty awesome, learned something about html while messing around with it and ended up with a great new tab page!"

k_on,3d71iy,NanakoDojima,2,Tue Jul 14 05:12:24 2015 UTC,"Yui vs. Honoka wasn't even close, go Yui! Next up for Ui is a tough one, Suguha Kirigaya from SAO. If Mugi has any secret powers besides turning into gel, she better use them, Erza Scarlet from Fairy Tail is her next one. In the current round, Sawako gets a bad draw; Asuna from SAO. Yeesh. Also, shout out for Ritsu in bracket A, she crushed her last opponent.  All of HTT is still in it, Mio is in bracket B & Azusa is in C. Keion, fight-o!"
k_on,3d71iy,10TailBeast,3,Wed Jul 15 09:10:47 2015 UTC,"What a great writeup! Poor Sawa-chan, Asuna is usually a powerhouse in these types of contests. Suguha will be rough for Ui, even though (in my opinion) Ui deserves to win in a landslide. I haven't watched Fairy Tail, but I know how popular it is so I fear for Mugi-sama's chances in the next round. Go go HTT!"
k_on,3d5b05,Bill_the_Pony,5,Mon Jul 13 17:16:56 2015 UTC,"I've seen this one before. Really bright colours and an adorable expression. Can't go wrong with this one, right? :D"
k_on,3d5b05,TheLazyBassist,4,Mon Jul 13 17:19:58 2015 UTC,"I agree.  The colors of that outfit are are a little crazy, but somehow is just just adds to the cuteness."

k_on,3d5gsl,treeman798,3,Mon Jul 13 18:15:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks! The biggest reason I kept the colours flat was because I'm a rather big fan of minimalism, although I'll most likely add shadows in the future!"

k_on,3d4nss,ScottFromCanada,2,Mon Jul 13 17:22:22 2015 UTC,"Most K-on songs are like that. Seems almost like progressive rock to me, with a pop feel. Even the simpler ones have much more interesting drum parts than most pop songs."

Seems like a bit of a waste of a sticky. haha Then again, my trivia topic seems like a bit of a waste of one now that I think about it. I should probably free up a sticky for something important, like a season 3 announcement.  Would it be less confusing if the questions were asked in the comments themselves and answered by replying? Then the OP would simply be a record of the question and who got it first.  When season 3 is announced (yea, I went there), I would be honored to have my topic booted to make room."

k_on,3d03lr,gulagmann,9,Sun Jul 12 13:02:48 2015 UTC,But can Mugi do this? About the trivia thing maybe it could be a weekly series..

k_on,3d03lr,NiSs4n,6,Sun Jul 12 16:10:45 2015 UTC,"lol What did you guys do to my topic? Clean that mess up this instant! xD Anyway, I was thinking of calling it Houkago Trivia Time. I would rely on my knowledge of the show to come up with my own trivia questions. I have re-watched K-On! more times than I care to admit and can come up with plenty of questions. At just one question per day, it should be doable. I'm up for making it a weekly thing, but would one question per week be enough? I also have no idea what the reward should be for the first correct answer. All I have is my congrats to give."
k_on,3d03lr,gulagmann,2,Sun Jul 12 18:01:53 2015 UTC,"Sorry it won't happen again! I promise.     Oh questions, I thought you meant just telling us fun facts about K-On. This could be fun. So like a quiz? Will there be prizes? Because I want there to be prizes, like a ticket to london or maybe all the mods could be force labored to make my Ritsu flai-  It sounds like a good time, one question per week is not enough - so maybe one question per day or a few once a week?"
k_on,3d03lr,gulagmann,2,Sun Jul 12 18:45:05 2015 UTC,"So like a quiz?   Yup, I guess I should have clarified that. Prizes are the one thing I really can't offer. lol Maybe keep a running score and after a set amount of time the top quizzer gets a special /r/k_on flair courtesy of the mods. I'd have to discuss that with them.  Edit: It will just be for fun, at least at the beginning. Easier that way."

Because I tried not to spend too much time, this one is a bit simple and rough, but I hope someone still likes it!"
k_on,3cz5x7,The_Kuroi_Kenshi,4,Sun Jul 12 02:46:48 2015 UTC,I love it!  Her cat mouth reminds me of the intro
k_on,3cz5x7,The_Kuroi_Kenshi,2,Sun Jul 12 03:04:37 2015 UTC,"I'm glad!  I've only seen K-ON once so far, so I don't know the intros by heart, which scene are you referring to?"
k_on,3cz5x7,NiSs4n,3,Mon Jul 13 21:15:24 2015 UTC,I believe its the cagayake girls intro.  Ritsu's wearing a green polo   while holding what appears to be a donut bag or something while smiling with a catlike expression
k_on,3cz5x7,The_Kuroi_Kenshi,2,Mon Jul 13 21:46:53 2015 UTC,Ritsu's wearing a green polo while holding what appears to be a donut bag or something while smiling with a catlike expression.gif

k_on,3cwr77,Nightshot,5,Sat Jul 11 14:15:52 2015 UTC,Yass more chibi gifs!!! Is there a source to these?
k_on,3cwr77,UWaffle,4,Sat Jul 11 13:48:07 2015 UTC,"Couldn't find the source but I found them by searching for tabletop simulator, I got curious when /u/Not_A_Buck mentioned it. Still I have no idea what the game is about.."
k_on,3cwr77,Justknight,5,Sat Jul 11 14:32:13 2015 UTC,"I've played this a few times, and it is essentially a game where you can play ""tabletop"" games such as chess, go, and poker.  It has workshop compatibility allowing people to skin things such as their playing cards."

k_on,3cwr77,UWaffle,2,Sat Jul 11 18:26:32 2015 UTC,That would be pretty cool! We should do that! After I learn how to play poker
k_on,3cwr77,Rithral,3,Sat Jul 11 19:17:07 2015 UTC,"The source is Kyoto Animation themselves, here's the amazon link to these cards.  Way too expensive."

k_on,3cx4rx,IZFSLE_,8,Sat Jul 11 15:35:51 2015 UTC,"Another classical K-On shot, I love these as they sum up the essence of the group, just girls with instruments tea having fun.     Mugi holding onto Yui's shirt is a nice detail, the group really needed her back then; just like how they and especially Yui will come to need Azusa later on.  As much as Yui is grateful for Azusa being in the group I think the rest of the group is just as grateful that Yui is with them, even with her shenanigans.  It's not K-On without Yui, Azusa, Mio, Mugi and Ritsu."
k_on,3cx4rx,gulagmann,4,Sat Jul 11 16:25:55 2015 UTC,I'm the plectrum... I'm the plectrum... I'm the plectrum...
k_on,3cx4rx,NiSs4n,2,Sat Jul 11 16:24:26 2015 UTC,"It kinda bothers me a bit to call the ""the original"" as if Azusa was just a sort of ""add on"". I don't know why but it's almost like saying she isn't really needed or wanted.  ALMOST! It's just the way I'm subconsciously perceiving it."
k_on,3cx4rx,ScottFromCanada,3,Sat Jul 11 18:30:13 2015 UTC,"Damn :(  Didn't mean for it to come off that way. I was just going by the order they joined and implying that they were there before Azusa. Azusa is still one of the five, but she did join a year later. They weren't officially HTT until she joined though."
k_on,3cwzwl,The_Kuroi_Kenshi,10,Sat Jul 11 14:49:16 2015 UTC,"Azusa should just wear a raincoat to the beach, she looks like she went in low orbit around the sun, poor thing."
k_on,3cwzwl,gulagmann,3,Sat Jul 11 15:40:27 2015 UTC,I wonder why Azusa tans so easily compared to the others.
k_on,3cwzwl,gulagmann,6,Sat Jul 11 15:45:14 2015 UTC,Probably so that we can make fun of her.
k_on,3cwzwl,EPLWA_Is_Relevant,5,Sat Jul 11 16:13:36 2015 UTC,I tan just as easily (but slightly slower) than Azunyan and it's not fun. At least I don't get sunburns...

k_on,3cw758,nickemeh,4,Sat Jul 11 07:55:16 2015 UTC,"As much as we hope so, I feel if it hasn't happened yet, it won't happen now. Although who knows, KyoAni might pick it up again to adapt the rest of the manga."
k_on,3cw758,UWaffle,2,Sat Jul 11 12:12:44 2015 UTC,"I sure hope so. It might be pretty unlikely though, as I'm sure most of the people who worked on the original 2 seasons might be pretty busy with other projects right now. Of course there's more material to adapt, and it would be awesome for more. I've already rewatched all of the episodes + movie 4 times now, and I'm not tired of it yet, but I hope they don't take too long if they decide to!"
k_on,3cw758,treeman798,2,Sat Jul 11 08:27:28 2015 UTC,"The original author Kakifly has stopped with the manga, but there's still more to Animate like Wakaba Girls and K-ON College, but the chances of them doing it are very slim.  But i do hope to see the Day it's announced."
k_on,3cw758,inDude,2,Sat Jul 11 09:09:02 2015 UTC,"It's possible, but the possibility is very slim. K-ON season 3 was originally planned to be made for the slot that Tamako Market eventually took instead, so it could be that it's just been pushed back to a later time. Then again, KyoAni has a habit of making incredibly popular series such as Lucky Star and Haruhi and then not continuing them despite there being a large demand or still parts of the story to tell."
k_on,3cw758,VeloxRdt,3,Sat Jul 11 10:31:26 2015 UTC,Why do you have such a hate of season 3's KyoAni also don't forget Hyouka not getting a season 2
k_on,3cw758,scottigecko,3,Sat Jul 11 15:34:17 2015 UTC,They hate 3 more than Valve :/
k_on,3cw758,GizmoRobin,2,Sat Jul 11 22:04:29 2015 UTC,"As of right now, there is nothing to indicate that another season/OVA is on the way.     All we can do is post cute gifs and artwork and hope they eventually decide to continue with College, Wakaba Girls or make a prequel with Death Devil."
k_on,3cw758,gulagmann,2,Sat Jul 11 15:31:39 2015 UTC,"They're planning 6 seasons, 2 more movies, a series of an unspecified number of OVAs, and a manga spinoff of the club when Sawako was a student.  Oh wait, that was just a dream I had...."

k_on,3ct4ul,UWaffle,2,Fri Jul 10 16:55:50 2015 UTC,"It might just be my upbringing, as when I was a kid nearly every meal  I ate was with rice. So I was conditioned into an eternal relationship with rice."
k_on,3ct4ul,Justknight,3,Fri Jul 10 22:37:00 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love rice. I like mine in a different way than normal though.  Like if I were to make 2 cups of rice, I would fill it up to the 2 1/2 mark of the ""white rice side"" to get it sticky."
k_on,3ct4ul,NiSs4n,3,Fri Jul 10 22:44:55 2015 UTC,"Rice is pretty amazing, although I don't know if I could eat just rice. After all, rice is a side dish."

As a nice background/atmosphere/mood song it is excellent. I wouldn't mind listening to this. All in all, it's a very good song, but not going to be regularly played in my playlist.  Also, this news about a new possible subreddit makeover sounds really wonderful!"
k_on,3cpp98,TheLazyBassist,4,Thu Jul 9 20:50:09 2015 UTC,"It's really good, but I agree with you that I wouldn't casually listen to it. It sounds more like the opening to a romcom anime or a SoL Montage background song. It's pleasant to listen to, especially since Mugi's VA has the best singing voice IMO, but it's not something I'd listen to casually. Despite that, I really like it!"
k_on,3coot5,IZFSLE_,6,Thu Jul 9 15:25:37 2015 UTC,"For those who don't know this is official artwork from the movie Moe Keion Down: Leave No Yui Behind, the dramatic retelling of Operation Teacup, where in 2014 a K-On member was separated from the rest when she got distracted by a cat holding a piece of cake.     The movie shows the exciting rescue mission from various perspectives and a great twist where the cat turns out to quite helpful in azu-sisting them."

k_on,3ck1tz,kevvvn,6,Wed Jul 8 15:01:28 2015 UTC,I'm guessing that's where season 3 would be going
k_on,3ck1tz,brickmack,6,Wed Jul 8 15:48:19 2015 UTC,She would if the original K-ON members were still freshmen in college.  I'm talking about if they were sophomores and Azusa decided to go to the same college as them.
k_on,3ck1tz,akanyan,9,Wed Jul 8 15:49:31 2015 UTC,Azusa decided to go to the same college as them.   Implying she'd have a choice. Yui would probably hug her until she signed the admission paperwork
k_on,3ck1tz,brickmack,4,Wed Jul 8 16:49:14 2015 UTC,I'm almost positive that they covered that in the Manga and she's going to a different college.

k_on,3ck1tz,Bizcotti,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:07:40 2015 UTC,But to be fair she's going to college to be in the band she started with Ui and Jun.

k_on,3ck1tz,10TailBeast,2,Wed Jul 8 18:15:15 2015 UTC,I feel the same. I don't know if I like how they split the story between the college and the high school but it's really all they could do and it was still pretty well done.
k_on,3ck1tz,VeloxRdt,2,Wed Jul 8 18:18:10 2015 UTC,"I don't remember that. Would Ui really not follow her sister into that women's college? I find that very hard to believe.  Edit: I'm calling nobody a liar. If it's in the manga, it's canon, but Ui not wanting to be with her sis? ;_;"
k_on,3ck1tz,Nightshot,2,Thu Jul 9 11:00:13 2015 UTC,"Nope, it's heavily implied that she joins them"
k_on,3ck2e3,IZFSLE_,5,Wed Jul 8 14:59:57 2015 UTC,"You know, they are not going to keep looking like that if they eat that much cake. By the way, I love the tiny bow on Mugi's fingers. It's a very nice detail and a fingberbow is a completely new idea to me :D"

Don't worry Yui you still skipped years of drudgery learning to play the guitar well due to the magic of screenwriting so losing one strawberry is a tiny price to pay for that :D.

Examples being her and the cake when Yui was testing her temptation, or when she was caught fantasizing about being the club president after the seniors left."

k_on,3cacyi,IZFSLE_,6,Mon Jul 6 10:15:59 2015 UTC,"This is the picture I think of when I think of K-ON! actually, I think it just shows the overall feeling wich the anime has. :D (That like this laying in the grass with no worries kind of thing)"
k_on,3cacyi,Fragdiemilch,5,Mon Jul 6 15:12:16 2015 UTC,"It's like a comfy blanket, or like you said just laying in the grass. It's a really relaxing feeling that I think makes it so good. There's no harrowing conflict, no urgency (except when Yui forgot her guitar :P) and you can just wind down and forget about your day."
k_on,3cacyi,treeman798,3,Mon Jul 6 20:37:46 2015 UTC,Exactly!
k_on,3cacyi,Fragdiemilch,6,Mon Jul 6 22:35:56 2015 UTC,well except for the ultra hyper violence
k_on,3cacyi,scottigecko,5,Mon Jul 6 23:37:04 2015 UTC,We also see Mugi fast asleep in a warm spot in the sun.
k_on,3cacyi,10TailBeast,3,Mon Jul 6 16:33:49 2015 UTC,I know. I was also surprised to see the other members were there! Took me a while to notice...
k_on,3cacyi,TheLazyBassist,3,Mon Jul 6 19:59:01 2015 UTC,And here we see the Yuiius Hirasawarus-rex in her natural state; having her cavum oris ajar in the event that a cake may loom upon her.

k_on,3c82oj,Muur1234,6,Sun Jul 5 21:26:37 2015 UTC,Someone out there needs to edit the EDs and replace all the bandmembers with Azusa.

k_on,3c82oj,Striker6g,3,Mon Jul 6 05:09:50 2015 UTC,Yes. Everything is better with more Azusa.
k_on,3c82oj,tacotacoa,4,Fri Jul 10 07:50:54 2015 UTC,"Nice one of my favorite songs and favorite K-On ! , a mio version would be awesome"

k_on,3c9nsc,kism3,3,Mon Jul 6 14:16:30 2015 UTC,"Fantastic actually, thanks for asking!  As opposed to last year (spent ~1k there), this year was only about 600 which is a huge improvement. Regardless, it was a great weekend. Got to meet up with friends I really only see at conventions (and drink with them hehe), got to buy a lot of cool stuff, meet new people, meet some people in the industry cough cough make connections cough, you know...fun stuff!   But like I mentioned, got absolutely no sleep that weekend so I'm still recovering haha."
k_on,3c9nsc,MayoSimba,2,Wed Jul 8 07:05:29 2015 UTC,"That does sound like fun. Good job on not emptying your entire bank account, I've heard conventions can be quite tempting.     Connections huh, I see, I see, you and the Kotobukis scheming again.  It's too bad more of the sub couldn't meet up."

k_on,3c64j1,Leo0003,6,Sun Jul 5 07:37:30 2015 UTC,Wow! Now that looks like a collection. But I think it is a lot more enjoyable when someone posts these images online because you have the possibility of talking about them :D
k_on,3c64j1,TheLazyBassist,3,Sun Jul 5 06:36:15 2015 UTC,Someone could start a daily Mugi out of these.
k_on,3c64j1,NiSs4n,2,Sun Jul 5 18:51:05 2015 UTC,I might actually do that. Do you need to ask the mods before starting a series?
k_on,3c64j1,PM_ME_YOUR_CAT_,2,Sun Jul 5 23:03:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you better ask first"
k_on,3c64j1,NiSs4n,3,Sun Jul 5 23:20:45 2015 UTC,Not needed - it just so happens that the people that are running a daily series on this sub are moderators. You're free to post whatever you want as long as it doesn't break the rules!  Paging /u/PM_ME_YOUR_CAT_

k_on,3c4mf6,UWaffle,8,Sat Jul 4 19:26:20 2015 UTC,I think it's because it makes it look like she's reaching out the panel when her arm crosses over the white line.

k_on,3c4mf6,TheLazyBassist,3,Sun Jul 5 00:36:50 2015 UTC,Very nice! Was it difficult to make? It looks very believable. It's amazing how much you can do with these gifs. The official gif king is here. Or gif queen?
k_on,3c4mf6,treeman798,2,Sat Jul 4 19:50:53 2015 UTC,"Gif queen? Gif king? Difficult? Nonono. Time consuming? Yeah, at least with photoshop because I started with that since I was following a tutorial. When I mentioned it to a friend he was like ""Photoshop? Really? It's way easier with after effects by masking it"" that's when I realized I was stupid."

k_on,3c0r9u,treeman798,5,Fri Jul 3 19:36:35 2015 UTC,Especially since she admired Mio so it would've been cool to see them actually interact.
k_on,3c0r9u,UWaffle,3,Fri Jul 3 23:48:49 2015 UTC,"Totally. With a season 3 following them in their last year of high school would be awesome as we would get more Ui, Azusa, Jun and new characters."
k_on,3c0r9u,treeman798,5,Fri Jul 3 23:49:56 2015 UTC,Don't forget about Sawa-chan!
k_on,3c0r9u,UWaffle,2,Fri Jul 3 23:53:14 2015 UTC,Of course! I guess Nodoka wouldn't get much screen time in a 3rd season unless it also followed the girls in college and she came to visit Yui.

Perfect day would be any day where I'm having a lot of fun, I try to have as many of them as possible.     I like this Mugi style and I hope you guys do it again for everyone else, great work on it.     There's been a lot of drama going on outside the sub but we're just sitting here drinking tea and eating cake, life is good.  Have a good summer everyone!"
k_on,3c0385,gulagmann,3,Fri Jul 3 18:53:54 2015 UTC,"Perfect day is a bright sunny day for me. Just being able to go outside and feel it on my skin is awesome, not to mention the fresh air. A perfect night for me though would be a dark stormy night. I've got skylights in my room so the rain basically puts me to sleep when it hits them. It's really calming."
k_on,3c0385,treeman798,3,Fri Jul 3 15:42:23 2015 UTC,Watching 10+ episodes of great anime during the day. Ordering a pizza and watching the Bears at night on Sunday or Monday Night Football.   So basically couch surfing. Yep.

k_on,3bvo32,The_Kuroi_Kenshi,9,Thu Jul 2 15:06:14 2015 UTC,After yesterday I think I have Mugi burnt into my retinas.

k_on,3btjxr,UWaffle,2,Fri Jul 3 23:44:03 2015 UTC,"I was pretty motivated to make this at the start (mostly due to love for K-ON and wanting to get a better feel for Unreal Engine 4 since I'm not yet comfortable with that version)!  Sadly not being able to properly export the game really made it feel pointless! There's a ""playable"" version of how far I was, but that has invisible walls and other weirdness in it."

k_on,3brj7b,TheLazyBassist,3,Wed Jul 1 16:38:55 2015 UTC,"Wait, how does the gilding work? What is gilding? I've never heard of that, but it sounds like fun."
k_on,3brj7b,The_Kuroi_Kenshi,2,Thu Jul 2 19:06:46 2015 UTC,"Gilding is typically when a redditor gives another redditor reddit gold due to a post/comment made.

k_on,3brown,SloppierKitty7,3,Wed Jul 1 16:36:00 2015 UTC,"I just finished installing and customizing this. For people who want to customize it, there could be some clearer instructions, so I'll try to help a bit.  If you want to customize any of this, you'll first need to download a program that will allow you to edit HTML. I use Adobe Dreamweaver, but there are several others you can use.  Open the ""tab.html"" file in your editor of choice. In this document, you can change the picture that you want to display (Azusa, Mugi, Mio, Ritsu, and Yui; all have a light and a dark version), change the links you want to be displayed on the gray boxes/dropdown box/lists at the bottom, and change any text on the page, such as the name the page welcomes.  To change the K-On displayed, hit Ctrl+F, type in ""azusa-light"" in the first box, and the K-On of your choice followed by a hyphen and either ""light"" or ""dark"" depending on the theme you want, then hit replace all. For example, if you want to change it to the light Mugi theme, like I did, you hit Ctrl+F, type in ""azusa-light"", type in ""mugi-light"", and hit Replace All.  Now you'll notice there is a block of text that contains several orangish-yellowish words. Don't do anything to that block, but look just below it. There's a tag labeled <Nav>. Everything inside that tag is where you edit any links. A link looks like this: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com"">YouTube</a>  All the links in this file are contained within lists. So in the file, the above link would appear as: <li class=""button button_grey""><a href=""https://www.youtube.com"">YouTube</a></li>  We just need to pay attention to the link part, though. The bit inside the quotation marks after 'href=' is the URL of the website you're linking to. Visit whatever website you want to link, copy the URL, and paste it into those quotation marks. Then, the part in the above link that just says 'YouTube' and is sandwiched between a greater than and lesser than sign (>YouTube</a>) is what text will display. You can change that to whatever you want.  So for instance, let's say I wanted to change the above YouTube link to link to, say, /r/magicTCG. Well, first, we'd change the link, so it'd look like this: <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG"">YouTube</a>  This still looks like it links to YouTube, though, even though it links to the Magic subreddit. Well, let's look at the next step to fix that. <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG"">Magic: the Subredditing</a>  Now our link will display as ""Magic: the Subredditing"". Neat, huh?  For this next part, you can again use the Ctrl+F function. In the first text box, type in ""SloppierKitty7"", and in the second, type in whatever you want the page to call you. I chose my name, but for the sake of anonymity, I'll make another one up. Say I typed ""Greg"" in the second text box. When we hit Replace All, it should replace ""SloppierKitty7"" with ""Greg"", and now when we open a new tab, we'll see the phrase, ""Welcome to the Internet, Greg""  In the same line as the one you just altered to say Greg, you can also find the text that says ""Welcome to the Internet, "". You can change this to whatever you want, as well. In fact, you could take it out entirely. Same with the line below it, which reads, ""Get out while you still can!"" Do whatever you want with it. Have fun!"
k_on,3brown,mrmoncriefman,3,Thu Jul 2 17:58:08 2015 UTC,well i don't know what to say but thanks for typing all of that i am sure this will help a load of people who want to customize it i am going to update the instructions in a bit as i am working on an update for the tab page

k_on,3brh0n,The_Kuroi_Kenshi,3,Wed Jul 1 15:39:32 2015 UTC,A lot of stuff happens in the song. It has that J-Pop feel to it very strongly. I'm not sure what contributes to that feeling. It's funny how many tricks they use to make the last chorus stand out. There's the mandatory transposing but also a quick pause and then the instruments stay quiet for a while before joining to the final chorus. This is like a handy collection of the most common ways to give weight to the final chorus :D
k_on,3brh0n,TheLazyBassist,2,Thu Jul 2 20:54:59 2015 UTC,"I really love chorus in the beginning. It's starts the song off with a lot of power.  And I don't really think they would've been able to pull the ""solo chorus"" off with any of the other voices.  Also, that piano solo in the middle sounds so tiring. <.<"
k_on,3bqnk2,JusTooLazY,13,Wed Jul 1 10:52:29 2015 UTC,Mine is when Mugi and Ritsu go out for a Commoner Appreciation Roadtrip. To see the two best girls properly interact for the first time in the series... also the strawberry scene. Love it.
k_on,3bqnk2,timemachine34,3,Wed Jul 1 14:16:52 2015 UTC,Yes! Ritsu and Mugi are awesome interacting together!
k_on,3bqnk2,treeman798,7,Wed Jul 1 17:22:57 2015 UTC,It's really hard to decide... I loved the first training camp (S1E4) because of the firework scene while this was playing. Also because of Moe Moe Kyun! and of course this too. Then there is that Miogasmic episode when they organized the tea party for the fan club and Mio didn't mind at all. I think I've listented to Pure pure heart the whole day after I watched that episode... And then of course episode 20...
k_on,3bqnk2,NiSs4n,7,Wed Jul 1 11:45:52 2015 UTC,"Training Camp (S1E4), I like the part where character development happens.  Teacher! / Senpai!

k_on,3bqnk2,NiSs4n,3,Wed Jul 1 12:59:28 2015 UTC,If the movie counted as an episode then definitely the movie.  I'd probably go with S1E6 because Christmas and just the atmosphere of the episode.
k_on,3bqnk2,The_Kuroi_Kenshi,4,Wed Jul 1 14:20:04 2015 UTC,"S2 E24. Pack your bags, its time for a Feel Trip!  I also loved the 2 part Natsu Fest and how the second episode was happening concurrently with the first. When Azu got hung up on by Yui at the end I laughed so damn hard"
k_on,3bqnk2,Bizcotti,3,Wed Jul 1 15:40:47 2015 UTC,I assume we're not counting Ura-On so I would say probably S2E2 because I just love the fact that Sawako has such a valuable guitar and just leaves it in a closet. Also there are too many hilarious scenes to count.
k_on,3bqnk2,UWaffle,2,Wed Jul 1 15:04:22 2015 UTC,Woah I didn't know what was Ura-On and that it existed. Going to watch them now

k_on,3bqnk2,10TailBeast,3,Wed Jul 1 16:11:12 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I love the finale episodes, of course. Also episode 20 of season 2. I think S1E7 with Sawako losing her mind at the Christmas party. Such a hilarious episode, complete with lots of Ui."
k_on,3bqnk2,treeman798,3,Wed Jul 1 16:33:07 2015 UTC,"It would either be S1E12, S2E1, or S2E20. Does the movie count as an episode? The movie is great!"
k_on,3bqnk2,inDude,3,Wed Jul 1 17:22:15 2015 UTC,I absolutely love S2 Ep 14 simply due to the episode being focused more on Mugi. Also S2 Ep 20 due to the fact that it's probably the only episode in an anime that has got me to cry.

Can't go wrong with that. :)  By the way, on the topic of actual maids in Akihabara, Tokyo, they actually do put on a cheerful smile and wave you in towards the maid cafes. It was very difficult to decide how to react because from the perspective of the culture where me and my friend come from that kind of super-submissive service attitude is really alien. Seeing those, what, high schoolers (?), having to wear the maid outfits and act cheerful just seemed rather unnerving. Of course if that's what they want to do then fine, but it was really something else to experience it first hand."

k_on,3bm52m,VeloxRdt,2,Tue Jun 30 19:17:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah , but Jun's bathing suit is a tiny little bit visible, so unless you look close it's not that lewd."

k_on,3biul1,gulagmann,4,Mon Jun 29 19:05:36 2015 UTC,Hotaru and Mio would be best friends. Same with Natsumi and Ritsu.
k_on,3biul1,gulagmann,3,Mon Jun 29 19:13:05 2015 UTC,"Renge and Azunyan, Sawa-chan and Komari. Mugi would be best friend with everyone because she's Mugi.  I wonder if tea tastes better in the countryside."
k_on,3biul1,10TailBeast,2,Mon Jun 29 19:22:08 2015 UTC,"Okay, I keep hearing about that anime, so I watched the first episode. It is...laid back to say the least. I like it. The little one is so funny.  ""Am I...""  Sees farmer walking cow, focuses on cow's head  ""...Living in the sticks?""  Edit: Gotta get to watchin'. The second season arrives in mid-July."
k_on,3biul1,gulagmann,2,Mon Jun 29 21:42:56 2015 UTC,"Enjoy it, Renge (Flute-chan) is great and has some of the best scenes.  I'm so glad we're getting more Non Non Biyori and Working!! in the same month."
k_on,3biul1,10TailBeast,2,Tue Jun 30 12:06:26 2015 UTC,"I binged all 11 other episodes last night. Wow. I can't wait until July 6th for the second season. I love NNB. The whole anime is so charming and the art & animation is beautiful. The actual Japanese countryside is well represented.  Now that I think about it, it's kind of anime's version of Green Acres. Big city folk end up in the country and kind of hate it/are shocked by it at first, but grow to really love it."
k_on,3biul1,gulagmann,2,Tue Jun 30 20:29:23 2015 UTC,"Glad to hear you enjoyed it! It was really charming, and some of the shots were breathtaking.    The part with Renge and Kaede in the past was really well done too, easily my favorite part."

Mugi has seen it and Mio & Yui just turned around to see what they're looking at. It could be that Mugi just tripped over a tie sticking up and is about to crash headlong in Ritsu, hence her facial expression.    Edit: Although, the tracks appear rusted and overgrown with grass, so Idk. Ritsu is terrified of something. She's clearly not smiling."

If we're able to count the movie, then yes, Ichiban Ippai is one of my all-time favorite HTT songs. I'd probably go with that as my favorite."

Utauyo Miracle's opening is so cool. It's like its own episode, and I love so much little things about it (like how they turn-on the camera, and how it builds into this awesome thing)."
k_on,3bkre9,asheppard308,4,Tue Jun 30 01:37:07 2015 UTC,Utauyo!! Miracle is almost the perfect song and intro. That opening bass riff :3

I like the mood (heck, the movie was beautiful xD).  Go Go Maniac, I think my fave song from the OPs set. Umm.. don't quite sure if I find something particulary special.. hmm probably the visuals? kinda crazy haha Yeah, I like these close ups to the instruments and stuff.  Cagayake Girls.

k_on,3bh29r,NiSs4n,3,Mon Jun 29 12:09:11 2015 UTC,It says it uses more but i honestly haven't noticed.
k_on,3bh29r,ofirissmart,5,Mon Jun 29 17:11:41 2015 UTC,"It probably depends on the gif, a large uncompressed gif would use a lot of battery while a smaller compressed gif (such as the one you are using) would have almost no impact on battery.  Using a video, for example, if you downloaded the gif as a webm or mp4, would use even less battery because most Android phones have dedicated hardware for decoding certain video file formats.  Unfortunately, there isn't really anything like AnimGIF Live Wallpaper for videos."

k_on,3bfsia,Muur1234,2,Sun Jun 28 21:36:08 2015 UTC,<3 Shiro is awesome :D
k_on,3bgi6g,Bizcotti,6,Mon Jun 29 00:48:17 2015 UTC,"Well I think that Azusa thought that's what Yui was trying to do because it didn't seem all that impossible. As for the letter, who knows what it could be. I know another person a while ago posted how they thought is was a love letter. :/"
k_on,3bgi6g,UWaffle,5,Mon Jun 29 01:26:25 2015 UTC,"Azusa probably did think Yui was lesbian for her because of the constant attachment to her, and perhaps that whole confusion was made clear when they started to sing for her.  As for the letter, it was probably a thank you letter since she had 3 other envelopes next to her."
k_on,3bgi6g,The_Kuroi_Kenshi,4,Mon Jun 29 02:18:51 2015 UTC,"Yea, but after she decked Yui, she realized she dun goofed. Yui is just very affectionate with people she likes. Azusa took that the wrong way. There were times when Yui acted like she was going to kiss her, but she was just trolling Azusa a bit. One attempt was so convincing, it got her slapped. xD"
k_on,3bgi6g,10TailBeast,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:35:37 2015 UTC,"Yui loves everyone :). She can't stop expressing her love, like what /u/10TailBeast said, and sometimes she just goes overboard (not like any of us minds). Perhaps Azusa just doesn't like the way Yui goes about expressing her love :)"
k_on,3bgi6g,MediocreFPS,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:39:00 2015 UTC,Oh ya I never felt Yui was anything but her normal friendly self. I was just questioning Azusa's thought process. Now Ritsu and Mio who knows lol
k_on,3bgi6g,Muur1234,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:26:09 2015 UTC,Azusa thinking lesbian seemed pretty obvious.  I assumed 4 messages about how much she cares about each of the girls for letters.

Ui is just all around wonderful. No, I'm not going full waifu, but I won't say it isn't tempting."

For a long time, I thought it was an error on KyoAni's part that they just magically got blankets over them. That's when I noticed Ui wasn't there. I guess she had some fun with them for awhile, then went to bed early."

I'm glad you enjoyed K-On! It certainly is one hell of a story that we all wished never ended... but you've already summed up that's it's fucking amazing with awesome writing and characters without having a real plot to it all. It really is fantastic."
k_on,3bdjaq,treeman798,6,Sun Jun 28 05:14:10 2015 UTC,Ah I really like Ritsu too. And Nodoka. And a little but of everyone else...   From what I gather there's a continuation manga when they're at college? Would you recommend that?
k_on,3bdjaq,MediocreFPS,5,Sun Jun 28 06:28:25 2015 UTC,"There's two separate continuations. There's K-On College which is the main characters in college together. There's also K-On High School which is about the younger characters (Ui, Jun, Azunyan) in high school."
k_on,3bdjaq,Bizcotti,2,Sun Jun 28 16:06:29 2015 UTC,"Ah, they sound great. I'll definitely have to check them out, thanks for the info!"

I'm enjoying all of them, Haganai S1 was really fun, I didn't think S2 was as good as S1 though but I'm not done with the second season yet so that opinion could change.     Ore Monogatari is really good so far, lots of fun.     Kiniro Mosaic is in it's class of it's own, it's the moeiest anime I've ever seen.

It's about a concert band and a group of girls in that band playing different instruments, but that's not the interesting part. The interesting question is what is the show really about and I would answer with: Being in a concert band in school and love, although love is not really a major part. The tone is very realistic and sensitive. This show is all about the characters. If character interaction is more important than action, then this might be the show for you. What this show has going for characters is an incredibly diverse and large cast and a great attention to detail in making everyone realistic."

By the way I'm calling it the New Age just to sound cool. Or maybe a shoutout to One Piece. Go to New World."
k_on,37bykk,FomorianKing,1 point,Tue May 26 16:06:47 2015 UTC,"He sounds like he's a bit bootybothered.  Also, I don't watch One Piece, because I like my anime plots like I like my orders: coherent and without filler."
k_on,37bykk,FomorianKing,1 point,Tue May 26 16:20:30 2015 UTC,"Don't want to sound defensive here, but One Piece is much more than the anime. The manga is written by a genius and is by miles the best-selling and most popular manga in Japan. The anime was eventually ruined by Toei, the studio behind it, starting around the 7th major story saga in the series, right after the timeskip. They can't even animate faces or body proportions properly anymore. As for filler, One Piece is notorious for actually needing more of it, since the anime pacing for the last few years has been atrocious.  As for being coherent, I don't see where your coming from. The story flows flawlessly and Oda is known for picking up any and all minor plot threads and connecting them somewhere in the story. Everyone who's ever read the series has said he's the best storyteller they've ever seen."
k_on,37bykk,Etonet,1 point,Tue May 26 16:35:32 2015 UTC,"Heh. Pointing out something being ""the most popular"" means very little to someone who thinks Game of Thrones suffers from a severe lack of originality.  Maybe it's the picking up of all those threads that made it incoherent for me, hmmm? Maybe questions were being answered that I didn't care to ask, and it drew away from the main plot thread by answering them. That's a kind of filler, in a way.  And if people are saying a currently living person is the best storyteller they've ever seen, I tend to not listen to those people, because they generally have not had a whole lot of experience with their culture's historical writings.  For clarification, I used the word ""anime"" loosely. I've only actually ever read One Piece, not watched it."

I cropped to a 16:9 resolution if you used the version you posted without cropping, it will look pretty poor.   http://oi61.tinypic.com/2mwxiy8.jpg  I also got rid of the text in the upper left corner which is also distracting if used as a wallpaper unaltered."

k_on,35tgb3,LibraryNerdOne,9,Wed May 13 16:18:23 2015 UTC,"This isn't about the /u/The_Kuroi_Kenshi. This is about the community and how we treat each other on this sub. I've grown tired of your power trip. Every time I want to make this sub nicer or add something new for the sub. You are the first to oppose it. It happened multiple times.  When I try to help you with your CSS errors. You are still rude. Why?  I wanted to bring /u/The_Kuroi_Kenshi onto the team, because of the large contribution that he makes to this community daily. Everyone respects and likes him. /u/TheLazyBassist even created artwork about him. That speaks to the deep impact that /u/The_Kuroi_Kenshi has made in this community. I didn't want to lose him after his 300th post. So I came to you first and again you opposed it. Calling us just ""Janitors/CSS/Art."" I don't see the community as just that.  That's why I left. Why should I make cool stuff for this sub. When all I will get are backhanded complements and opposition? That's why I left for /r/HTT/."

Last time I checked the only conflict we ever had was over /u/The_Kuroi_Kenshi, it's a tad weird when you say its not about them, look at all this hostility from the mod team that happened when you wanted to make changes.   When I try to help you with your CSS errors. You are still rude. Why?   Look at me being rude    Calling us just ""Janitors/CSS/Art.""   The moderators are not the community, we remove all the Hentai, we deal with the CSS, we sticky any nice discussion threads the community comes up with."
k_on,35tgb3,UltimateEpicFailz,2,Wed May 13 17:17:10 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the late response, but I'd like to discuss your last point in particular.   The moderators are not the community, we remove all the Hentai, we deal with the CSS, we sticky any nice discussion threads the community comes up with.   I strongly disagree with this statement. I think our different interpretations of what a moderator is, is part of why what happened did. I see a moderator as a member of the community with responsibility - someone with a shared passion with the community that shows that through their various responsibilities.   If I wasn't a fan of any of the anime the subs I mod are based on, I simply wouldn't mod them. Rather than seeing myself as essentially an unpaid worker that just does my job, I see myself as part of the community. I get that not everyone likes to be open and actively engage with people, whether that's due to their personality or simply being busy. That's just how people are.  However, at the very least, I feel any mod team requires at least one moderator to serve as the connection between the mod team and the subscribers. Whether this serves as a way to notify subscribers of a rule change or another announcement, or to get feedback on different parts of the subreddit, it's one of - if not the most important job a moderator has.  Without that, can you really say you're part of the community?"
k_on,35tgb3,LibraryNerdOne,1 point,Fri May 15 07:19:51 2015 UTC,"LOL. You're kidding right? Selective screenshots don't mean much, dude.  So when I fixed the CSS. I PM'd you to tell you that I fixed everything and you said ""It's okay now. I grow tired of this conversation."" I didn't wait close to an hour to be brushed off so rudely. Where is that in the screen shot?  Or the screen shot of you getting upset that I might replace your sprite flairs? Where is the screen shot of you saying ""everyone is going to want the sprite flair icons back."" All I did was ask to ""add"" more flair. You didn't seem happy about that. Until, I mentioned that we would still have your flairs. Where is that screenshot?  ""Janitors/CSS/Art"" are your words not mine. I don't think the mods are the community. But we shouldn't stand by and let it die out either. Especially when people were already in agreement that /u/The_Kuroi_Kenshi is the main reason they come back. That's why I brought up making him a mod. To help keep the community going. You made it clear that losing /u/The_Kuroi_Kenshi didn't matter to you and my opinion didn't matter either. So what else is there to say."
k_on,35tgb3,kism3,2,Thu May 14 00:29:33 2015 UTC,Selective screenshots   Literally went through my message history and got every post from you that wasn't /u/The_Kuroi_Kenshi related   Where is that in the screen shot?

""Also if the flair is good enough you can just straight up replace mine if you don't think it will annoy the annoy the community.""  How will it annoy the community if we are just adding stuff? You sounded somewhat offended by the idea. I had to make sure you didn't feel offended with the flair updates. So I decided to keep the sprite flairs, but add stuff to them. I waited for others to respond. /u/MayoSimba thanked me for considering his point of view on the matter and said ""We should stick together.""  Here is my side of the letter to the entire mod team asking for /u/The_Kuroi_Kenshi to be considered as a new mod.  In your response you asked ""What would u/The_Kuroi_Kenshi would bring to the team?"" You also mentioned what you thought about the community. So I responded and I never got an answer. So I decided to leave. Why should I work with someone who hands out backhanded compliments and is opposed to changes? I'm done. You go your way and I'll go my way."

They only play the first few verses of a song on the show and this is the first time I looked at the full translation. That's when it hit. In the case of U & I, cutting off a lot of the song to save time hurt it's impact, but I understand why they did it. They had to.

I don't think the manga is required reading (but I'm willing to stand corrected).  Definitely watch the anime with someone else if possible.  Watch it at a relaxed time. Don't try to squeeze it into your schedule. Relax and enjoy the show."
k_on,357ggr,B-Con,2,Thu May 7 22:41:44 2015 UTC,"Having just finished the manga an hour or so ago, I would say definitely give it a read. Some of the events in the manga are quite different from the anime. Some things I think the manga does better, but as /u/deeefoo pointed out, dat music. There are some laugh out loud and ""Awwww..."" moments that also only happen in the manga, too. Read it after you finish the anime, though, IMO."
k_on,357ggr,10TailBeast,3,Fri May 8 21:53:04 2015 UTC,"haha Binge watching is certainly one way to do it, but only if you really like shows like K-On!. I know that, sadly, it's not for everyone. In that case, smaller chunks are the way to go. I do, however, second the snacks. I began with the anime and am now reading the manga. With the anime, watch the two seasons then the movie. I don't know what your favorite streaming site is, but try to find one that has all the OVAs. The only ""legit"" one that carries K-On! is Hulu, but last I checked they didn't have any of the OVAs."

k_on,34vgs4,MajesticRadish,5,Tue May 5 15:04:00 2015 UTC,"Wow, that CD collection looks amazing. I'm betting it was pretty pricey..."
k_on,34vgs4,IncendiaryLemon88,2,Tue May 5 18:11:24 2015 UTC,"yeah, it was kinda expensive.. but quality and content totally make up for that."
k_on,34vgs4,MajesticRadish,2,Tue May 5 18:22:40 2015 UTC,I can agree with that. It looks like a superb set.
k_on,34vgs4,IncendiaryLemon88,4,Tue May 5 18:23:50 2015 UTC,"Nowhere near enough k-on! merch, you should get more.  Istillhateyou"
k_on,34vgs4,Rithral,3,Wed May 6 15:59:06 2015 UTC,That artwork book looks cool.
k_on,34vgs4,Muur1234,6,Tue May 5 18:01:02 2015 UTC,Well it was $200 well spent
k_on,34vgs4,noob343,11,Tue May 5 10:56:38 2015 UTC,Here's pretty much everything I have.
k_on,34vgs4,Tsufuro,9,Mon May 4 22:17:21 2015 UTC,I bought a Ritsu figma and broke it immediately after taking out the box......   http://i.imgur.com/lugQR4Q  Snapped off her arm and drumstick.  Still clutching hold of the bleach I'm trying not to drink.
k_on,34vgs4,NiSs4n,7,Tue May 5 18:56:40 2015 UTC,"well, at least the face fits to the situation"
k_on,34vgs4,Tsufuro,3,Tue May 5 20:34:51 2015 UTC,"She's on my shelf now with my other figmas, giving a painful thumbs up with her one good arm, with that same face."
k_on,34vgs4,MajesticRadish,3,Tue May 5 21:07:55 2015 UTC,ouch.. I can feel your pain.
k_on,34vgs4,Darkcruise,2,Tue May 5 19:09:31 2015 UTC,"Man, I did the same with one of my figmas a while back.. I feel your pain.."
k_on,34vgs4,REsoleSurvivor1000,1 point,Thu May 7 05:30:39 2015 UTC,No ways to fix it reliably? I haven't had this situation yet so I'm curious.
k_on,34vgs4,Tsufuro,2,Thu May 7 01:15:01 2015 UTC,"Not really, I could probably put it back in a fixed position but as it's the smaller 'internal joint' part that has snapped off inside the arm, it's hard to keep it attached with glue when you attempt to put any pressure on it."
k_on,34vgs4,Rectal_Splash,5,Thu May 7 17:25:49 2015 UTC,I can't post picture because I'm on mobile but I am the proud owner of the complete 5 year anniversary figure collection.
k_on,34vgs4,Emper24,6,Tue May 5 01:53:25 2015 UTC,"Some figures, some more figures and a painting, and a custom made button."
k_on,34vgs4,sovereign_circle,2,Tue May 5 09:44:36 2015 UTC,"That painting is awesome! Did you do it yourself, or did you get it somewhere?"
k_on,34vgs4,Emper24,2,Fri May 8 19:25:34 2015 UTC,"This is the picture I used, I only spray-painted it in the canvas myself."
k_on,34vgs4,sovereign_circle,2,Fri May 8 20:48:12 2015 UTC,"It looks badass, I might have to try something similar in the near future."
k_on,34vgs4,IncendiaryLemon88,5,Sat May 9 05:20:43 2015 UTC,"Not a lot. Just Season 1 and 2 on DVD, the movie on Blu Ray (also comes with the DVD) and a single wall scroll. I really want to get either the SQ Azusa or the SQ Yui but I have no idea where I'd put them."
k_on,34vgs4,Muur1234,1 point,Tue May 5 07:42:22 2015 UTC,"I need that wall scroll, tbh."

k_on,34vgs4,Muur1234,2,Tue May 5 18:01:19 2015 UTC,I'll trade you for my soul.
k_on,34vgs4,IncendiaryLemon88,3,Tue May 5 18:03:00 2015 UTC,The scroll looks nicer on my wall than your soul would :P

I also have a bunch of little keychains and a wall scroll of Mugi and Yui (unofficial).  Edit: I also have a K-On artbook that came with a CD of wallpapers.  I like Mugi..."
k_on,34vgs4,kism3,4,Tue May 5 11:27:57 2015 UTC,My entire K-ON merch collection is two posters I got for free at a pop culture convention.   I was going to make one of these threads myself and pin it for a week instead of the weekly song threads.  Ill pin this instead and leave it up for a couple of weeks (sorry /u/ultimateepicfailz)

k_on,34vgs4,MajesticRadish,2,Tue May 5 22:07:29 2015 UTC,"The one on the left I got at MCM expo in London, the middle one from the official Kyoani store in Kohata and the one on the right I got from a Mandrake in Tokyo."
k_on,34vgs4,Hoogyme,2,Wed May 6 07:30:33 2015 UTC,The Artbook comes with the History's Music Box. I think you can pick that up at YesAsia for around 174$
k_on,34vgs4,Muur1234,7,Wed May 6 17:11:43 2015 UTC,This is all I've got  An Azunyan Nendoroid. I think it might actually be a fake one too.
k_on,34vgs4,Rectal_Splash,5,Tue May 5 05:15:39 2015 UTC,I have one of those too.  http://i.imgur.com/nZYPtkT.jpg  It is also the only merch I have.

Whenever I hear one, I remember the other and I have to play it next. I wonder when the discussion for that other song will be...  Anyway, this is a great song from start to finish. Hearing Mio sing is really soothing."
k_on,34ukc0,fanbesideme,2,Tue May 5 10:37:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I love the part in that episode where she reads the lyrics to Tokimeki Sugar and it sounds ridiculous but it actually ended up being one of my favorite songs."

k_on,34r4is,biggsk,11,Sun May 3 20:59:34 2015 UTC,"People on /a/ and other places that think anime and anime culture are SRS BSNS get seriously bootybothered about K-On!! because they blame it for almost or completely creating ""moe"" culture, which they view as a detriment to their hobby's public image.  What they fail to realize is two things:   Their image wasn't great to start with. Clannad created moe, not K-On!! K-On!! just did it better."
k_on,34r4is,FomorianKing,4,Sun May 3 21:29:29 2015 UTC,I can't believe people good clannad responsible for moe. It was so much more than a show made for the sake of being cute. There's really very little of that in clannad. I'd say if anything Lucky Star probably started it at the forefront.
k_on,34r4is,akanyan,5,Mon May 4 03:19:17 2015 UTC,"""Uguu"" was enough. Lucky Star was mocking it as much as being it."
k_on,34r4is,FomorianKing,1 point,Mon May 4 03:24:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I realize that Lucky Star was doing a tongue in cheek impression of a genre that really didn't exist yet, but it did such a good job I feel like it almost set an example for future shows."
k_on,34r4is,akanyan,1 point,Mon May 4 04:53:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if anything Kanon started it.  Although really it's KyoAni on the whole that helped usher in the genre."
k_on,34r4is,B-Con,1 point,Mon May 4 07:23:44 2015 UTC,What do you mean by SRS BSNS? Serious business?  Haha I like moe stuff.  I like a wide variety of genres and styles. Thanks :P

k_on,34r4is,JJFirehawk,7,Sun May 3 22:33:40 2015 UTC,Really confused on why your friends would say that. If you like cute girls doing cute things while occasionally singing then this show is for you.  Did I mention that k-on is freaking awesome???
k_on,34r4is,10TailBeast,1 point,Sun May 3 21:25:25 2015 UTC,XD alrighty! I do haha.
k_on,34r4is,10TailBeast,7,Sun May 3 22:22:49 2015 UTC,Who cares what others think.  Just watch it and decide whether you like it or not. (Hint: you will!)
k_on,34r4is,10TailBeast,6,Sun May 3 21:34:47 2015 UTC,"Haha thanks! Yeah I think I will watch it. Even if I risk them disowning me for some reason.  If that happens, then they aren't true friends for judging like that."
k_on,34r4is,10TailBeast,5,Sun May 3 22:24:54 2015 UTC,"If that happens, then they aren't true friends for judging like that.   This, right here. Take no offense, but those particular friends kinda sound like douchenozzles. Just sayin'. Lemme tell you, I am a grown adult male and enjoy my fair share of explosions in my anime. Ghost in the Shell is among my favorite movies/series, but I'll be damned if K-On! didn't capture my heart. Far & away my #1. It's the story of a group of strangers who meet and become close. Did anyone mention they also happen to play awesome music together?  I didn't know shit about the different genres before I began watching K-On!. I didn't give a damn. I didn't care if it was ""moe"" or ""slice of life."" All I knew was I loved it. I'll never understand tagging something and then not watching it just because of that."
k_on,34r4is,IZFSLE_,1 point,Mon May 4 00:54:18 2015 UTC,"Haha, thanks. Yeah they are good friends of mine. I'm not sure what caused them to act like that because it's not normal for them.   douchenozzles   Lol that's a new one  Yeah I'm 20, almost 21, and I enjoy most genres out there. I like a wide variety of anime."
k_on,34r4is,jgamer99,4,Mon May 4 02:01:34 2015 UTC,"I guess letting them off the hook when they do or say something dumb is all part of the deal. :D   Love Live! is actually what made me seek out other music animes. My taste in music is as wide as my taste in animes. Everything from CCR to Metallica, to stuff that many would say is well below my age level. Idgaf xD   Here is one of the songs from the anime if you want to sample it. It's one of my favorites, great guitar riff at the beginning."
k_on,34r4is,slibsirk,1 point,Mon May 4 02:09:42 2015 UTC,"XD  I've heard of Love Live, I'll have to add it to MAL.  I don't listen to music too too often. But yeah, I do like somewhat if a variety.  Been listening to Vocaloid a lot recently. Also, some AMVs on YouTube have introduced me to some really interesting songs I wouldn't have know otherwise haha.  Edit: Yeah, that song sounds good."
k_on,34r4is,ScottFromCanada,2,Mon May 4 02:20:07 2015 UTC,What I know of Vocaloids is limited to Hatsune Miku & her friends. Luka is my favorite.
k_on,34r4is,slibsirk,2,Mon May 4 02:31:38 2015 UTC,Yes! Luka is my favorite too haha.  Edit: Lol someone is going through and downvoting me for some reason.  How mature.

k_on,34r4is,slibsirk,2,Mon May 4 02:45:59 2015 UTC,Yuuup.
k_on,34r4is,jasonic5,10,Mon May 4 02:47:44 2015 UTC,"1) K-On! isn't shoujo. It comes from a seinen manga publiciation. It's geared towards an older audience because it takes maturity to enjoy. Young minds are going to disregard it since there is no killing, masterminds, or plot twists.   2) If your friends told you it was shoujo, and then said to avoid it, then they're not very knowledgeable about anime. They seem like the type of fan who hangs out on 4chan and will only watch the latest Madhouse production.  3) Sorry to be stern, but just watch it without any pre-determined biases. If the slice of life genre isn't for you, then I wouldn't recommend it. But, if you can enjoy amazing characters, and you easily get attached to those characters, then I would say go for it."
k_on,34r4is,Sonickku,1 point,Sun May 3 21:36:05 2015 UTC,"Oh my bad.  I thought it was a shoujo, though that was just me guessing based off of how it looks.  I thought Kiniro Mosaic was one too, but someone told me it wasn't, and I liked KiniMoza a lot.  Yeah MAL only has K-On! Listed as  Comedy, Music, School, and Slice of Life.  I've been told that sometimes anime on MAL isn't listed under correct genres, so I just assumed that was the case on this too.  Haha, np. I appreciate the input!  Yeah, I do plan on watching it."
k_on,34r4is,10TailBeast,3,Sun May 3 22:31:25 2015 UTC,"If you like kiniro mosaic, you will love this show I'm pretty sure. They have a similar feel and are both good for similar reasons."

If Hulu Plus began streaming the episodes off of that Blu-ray collection, that would get me to subscribe again, commercials and all. I have the movie and K-On! in 1080p is glorious.

The solo might be a little to get used to and the arpeggiated part as well in terms of picking pattern, however other than that its not all too hard. If you know how to do pinch harmonics, you might enjoy the harder challenge of Bitter Sweet Beauty Song however the sheet music for that seems almost non existent in anything even close to accurate in both tab and standard so you'll have to learn that one by either eye or ear."

I think I'm gonna start with Fuwa Fuwa, then I'll try No, Thank You! and Don't Say Lazy when I get more comfortable with the instrument.  Anyone got any good tabs of Fuwa Fuwa? I'm using Tron544's, but it's always good to be open to suggestions. Also, anyone wanna tell me how I can do a strum pattern while only hitting a few strings? Do I just mute the other ones with my fingers?"
k_on,33k45q,guislavi,1 point,Fri Apr 24 02:34:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, Tron's tab is good to learn at a first moment, after that you can polish a bit by yourself. An advice I can give to you is: have persistence. You need to repeat several times to get a better result. Answering your other question, you need to practice your palm mutting technique. Is simple: just place the left side of your strumming hand near the bridge of the guitar, like this: http://pad1.whstatic.com/images/thumb/6/66/Palm-Mute-Step-2.jpg/760px-Palm-Mute-Step-2.jpg   * EDIT: corrected a few grammar mistakes"

k_on,33dn7b,23290867,2,Tue Apr 21 23:39:00 2015 UTC,I just finished it a few days ago as well. Did not disappoint.   Pretty sold on Mugi as best girl. Azu-nyan is pretty close though. They are all great though.
k_on,33dn7b,nemunomune,4,Thu Apr 23 19:36:09 2015 UTC,Get that best gurl flare on!!
k_on,33dn7b,Nyhuset,5,Tue Apr 21 18:01:11 2015 UTC,There all best girl to me...

k_on,33agew,FomorianKing,9,Tue Apr 21 07:04:29 2015 UTC,Give it a few seconds. Her cloaking field is up.

k_on,33805e,koujm,6,Mon Apr 20 13:36:10 2015 UTC,"Love her character songs. Would have been great to have a 3rd season and see her as part of Wakaba Girls. She has such a cute singing voice, maybe even cuter than Yui's."

k_on,33805e,BoltVital,2,Mon Apr 20 21:17:49 2015 UTC,this made the front page of reddit :) great job
k_on,33805e,Flamespiter,9,Mon Apr 20 12:45:56 2015 UTC,Are you sure it wasn't your front page (your subscribed subreddits)? I'd be very surprised if this made it to /r/all lmao  Although I'd like to see that...
k_on,339kw5,UltimateEpicFailz,2,Mon Apr 20 19:08:18 2015 UTC,"Ritsu may be my favorite girl out of the bunch. But I have to say, out of the songs, Mugi definitely has all my favorites."
k_on,339kw5,Salfron,2,Mon Apr 20 23:03:39 2015 UTC,Easily my favorite song from the whole series. It made me physically buy this CD just because I love it so much. Never knew how beautiful a song could be.
k_on,339kw5,Chemlicker,2,Wed Apr 22 18:49:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, they are. Haha!"
k_on,339kw5,guislavi,2,Thu Apr 23 01:31:59 2015 UTC,"You bet I am in agreement with this!  This song is actually really nice. A lot of interesting rhythmical elements in the percussion. For example the really fast kongos (?) in 2:19, the double-bass run at 2:36 and the cymbal that is chopped to pieces in 3:13. The sounds of the song are very cohesive and the there's a very natural progression to the song. There's also a fair bit of variation. I would have to listen to it a couple of more times to really give an opinion on it. The melodies are also quite nice and they really fit her vocal range. Unfortunately there also is no show-stopper moment, but it's not like every song in the world needs that. It will be interesting to see if these sounds will one day sound dated or not, because there's such an interesting concoction of different sounds here."
k_on,336xmn,Pikawil,5,Mon Apr 20 02:46:02 2015 UTC,Maybe this long torture of Yui is why I still deserve the terrible user flairs...
k_on,336xmn,ReverseMankey,3,Mon Apr 20 02:46:28 2015 UTC,This makes for a really cool series of con photos - everyone clearly loves Yui.

k_on,334tk8,The_Kuroi_Kenshi,3,Sun Apr 19 15:39:37 2015 UTC,I wish I could visit that place and get me a Max Burger...  This is a funny coincidence because I ate McDonald's today for the first time in like a year and it was because my lunch wasn't enough. Studying all day really used my energy and McDonald's was the only thing close and in my budget. But there was no Mugi. There never is a Mugi. mumble mumble...
k_on,334tk8,TheLazyBassist,5,Sun Apr 19 20:17:22 2015 UTC,i mean i could find a wig and your address if you want
k_on,334tk8,UltimateEpicFailz,4,Sun Apr 19 20:52:30 2015 UTC,This is seriously the greatest sacrifice anyone has offered to do for me. You have my unconditional gratitude :D.  Although I don't know how I would react if a stranger came to my door with a blond wig and a keytar.
k_on,334tk8,TheLazyBassist,3,Sun Apr 19 21:07:19 2015 UTC,"hmm, you'd probably have to notify the authorities beforehand in case anyone reports suspicious activity"
k_on,334tk8,UltimateEpicFailz,2,Sun Apr 19 21:14:41 2015 UTC,Why does Mugi work at a Max Burger? For fun?
k_on,334tk8,wildcatoffense,8,Sun Apr 19 19:42:49 2015 UTC,"In the anime she's a girl who finds joy in the simple, commoner things.  If I recall correctly, she got a job just because she wanted to experience how working at a fast food restaurant would be.  She also wanted to get hit by Mio because she thought it looked fun when Mio did it to Ritsu or something like that.  She even bought a spoon cleaning kit from the hardware store and found joy in that.     Yep. Mugi's that kind of rich."
k_on,334tk8,devil_92,2,Sun Apr 19 19:53:06 2015 UTC,There is actually a Max burger chain where i live :) no Mugi though :(

I was never happy with the Mio/Azunyan/Mugi flair I made, partially because I decided to use a stupidly low resolution and also since I had literally no pixel art experience at the time (this hasn't changed lol).  When the original flair was done by me (2012) it was just me and /u/cipherix running this place. I doubt that /u/cipherix could have done better though  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"

Anime works a lot better for music-related stuff than manga (Shigatsu, Beck, and Detroit Metal City, for example). I'd personally recommend the anime (sub) over the manga, since the voice acting is perfect, and the HTT songs are amazing. There's also a movie that takes place before the final few episodes of the 2nd season, but I'd watch that afterward."

k_on,3288bs,10TailBeast,3,Sat Apr 11 14:25:04 2015 UTC,"I just realized how bad a teacher Azusa is. If somebody is holding a guitar for the first time ever you don't even mention the F chord, just forget it exists. Make them pluck single notes, maybe some easy chords (E-A-D-G7), some power chords. But an F chord will just make them drop guitar forever."
k_on,3288bs,nikidash,1 point,Sat Apr 11 19:49:22 2015 UTC,"To be fair, It looks like Azunyan is showing her a Barred F. Not that hard... Especially on a 24"" scale length that the Mustang has. Maybe I just never had a problem with it.   Edit: I've just thought about something. I've Azusa likes to play jazz, and was planning on joining the jazz club, she probably has some pretty hefty strings on her guitar. probably something like .13-.60-.62. That would make playing anything for a beginner pretty difficult."

A barre isn't that hard when you have some experience, especially on higher frets, but for the weak finger of a beginner it's really hard.

k_on,324aij,FomorianKing,-2,Sat Apr 11 10:07:50 2015 UTC,This is pushing the NSFW rule
k_on,324aij,kism3,3,Fri Apr 10 17:40:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think this is any more lewd than visible panties or anything.   Others pointed out that the title implies lewdness, and I'm sorry if that is the case. English isn't my primary language and this was meant to be a translation of the german proverb ""Ein schöner Rücken kann auch entzücken"", a completely non-sexual saying. To clarify, ""rear"" isn't meant as ""butt"", but rather as ""back"". My dictionary said rear was a synonym of back and is only translated as butt when used very colloquially.    By googling I found different ways to translate the proverb, the other being ""A beautiful back can also delight"" but it didn't rhyme, so I assumed ""A beautiful rear can also endear"" was a similar english proverb, bearing the same non-sexualized meaning."
k_on,324aij,Hoogyme,1 point,Fri Apr 10 20:17:43 2015 UTC,What about the beach episode in the show? Was that NSFW?
k_on,324aij,Rithral,8,Fri Apr 10 19:08:14 2015 UTC,"Arguably with Ritsu's bra falling off the intent of the image is different than the show, and the title of the submission does give it a more lewd tone.  That said, I don't think this is too lewd, though there's images on this set that might cross the line."
k_on,324aij,Hoogyme,2,Fri Apr 10 20:00:10 2015 UTC,Honestly not sure how I didn't notice that.
k_on,324aij,Rithral,1 point,Fri Apr 10 21:48:58 2015 UTC,"How does a bra falling of at the beach give it any sexual meaning? You only see her back. Women on public beaches often don't wear bras at all, with even the front of their breasts showing. At least in Europe. Though I understand that in some parts of the world people are more prudent and I try to respect that, hence I don't post pictures where naked breasts are visible.    EDIT: To clarify. The ""falling of"" is the reason it isn't sexual, but rather a funny accident. It'd be different if someone took it off her or she would show them around or something."
k_on,324aij,IZFSLE_,3,Fri Apr 10 20:24:57 2015 UTC,"The thing is Japan usually does lewd that way, there's a lot of shitty animes where a girl just trips, falls over and ends up with her ass on top of the face of a guy.  It might be ""accidental"" and supposed to be ""funny"" but the intent is to create a lewd scene without having to go through a lot of explanation, whenever this is completely retarded is another discussion.  Again, I don't think this is too lewd, nor I'm suggesting it should be removed, but with Japan's perverted viewpoint this is a sexual tease in some way."

A warmth is moving towards me  I feel something touch me  It's Ritsu  I am so happy  She whispers in to my ear, ""This is my club""  I grab her with her powerful drummer hands and put her on her hands and knees  I'm ready  She spreads her ass cheeks for me  I penetrate her butthole  It hurts so much but I do it for Ritsu  I can feel her butt tearing as my eyes start to water  I push against her force  i want to please Ritsu  I roar a metal roar as I fill her butt with my love  Mio walks in  I look her straight in the eye and said ""Lewd. Way too lewd.""  I leave through Ritsu's window  Ritsu is love, Ritsu is life   I really could use a Yui takeover though please don't shoot me"

So far, Kumiko isn't anywhere near as interesting as a lead as Yui IMO. There is definitely potential though."

I don't think that's a good idea. KyoAni's all-stars are making it (Mio & Mugi's Japanese VAs, too :D), so of course I'm hyped beyond belief, but calling it the second coming of K-On! could actually cause a person to get less enjoyment out of it because it wasn't what they wanted or expected."

I wonder why?). It's great to have someone with that ability put into words everything that K-On! is about.  I felt immense attachment to the characters with my first watch of K-On!. It doesn't surprise me at all that lots of people have been impacted similarly. I've seen it 3 times in the last 6 months. Honestly, it would be more, but I try to space out re-watches just to keep the entertainment value fresh. That wouldn't be an issue with K-On! all that much, but nonetheless, I don't want to watch it to death. Before I was into anime, I watched Avatar: The Last Airbender 8 or 9 times in a row. Just over and over again. I still love it, but it's been almost a year and half since I've seen it because I just haven't felt the need to watch it.  Anyways, you should visit this sub more often. It's a pretty damn good community. I know most online anime communities tend to be high in acidic comments and memes, but not /r/k_on.   K-On! truly does bring out the best in people and it shows with this sub.  Once again, great read. I love people who show their passion for things. Bravo.  *I did see that you said this in your write-up:   There’s not really anything meaningful in this SOL like there is in ones such as Barakamon or Usagi Drop, but that doesn’t mean it’s not good.   That's the lone point where I will have to disagree with you. This show is the same as the Aria series (which I feel is somewhat of a sister to K-On!), in that it stresses the theme of cherishing the present, but looking to the future. This is prevalent throughout the series and especially towards the end. It also stresses the fact that you should cherish the people who are closest to you and never let them go.  Same concepts in the Aria series.  I love Usagi Drop, as well, but I still feel that K-On! holds even more thematic and emotional meaning, not because of the subject matter (which was obviously more serious in Usagi Drop), but because of the way it was executed. K-On! impacted me infinitely more than Usagi Drop, which once again, is another one of my favorite anime, but it just doesn't have the grandiose I feel K-On! has. As for Barakamon, it fell a tad short for me, so I won't go into that."

I, myself, am not all that great at verbalizing things (Even though it goes great in my head. I wonder why?). It's great to have someone with that ability put into words everything that K-On! is about.   It did take me several hours of writing and editing to write this essay. Almost every sentence from my rough draft ended up being tweaked for the final draft. I'm not particularly gifted at writing but put a lot of effort and passion into this essay.    in that it stresses the theme of cherishing the present, but looking to the future.   This is a good point and something I will be bringing up whenever I talk about K-On in the future. Cherishing the present is definitely a theme that's consistent through the entirety of K-On and is highlighted in certain episodes(Azunyan being drug along by Yui during that festival where the fireworks are going off comes to mind). Here's a gif from right before the scene I'm talking about. It's at the end of episode 13 if you wanna check it out. Great scene. Looking to the future is present much more in the second half of the second season but is definitely a major theme during this part. Everyone sees the upcoming graduation for the 4 seniors and that shadow looms over the group at times. In that scene I mentioned Azunyan also worries about what will happen when the seniors are gone. This looking towards the future makes the cherishing the present more important. These two themes reinforce each other and are amplified."

The TV series Friends managed to stay on the air for several years that way. Just telling the story of a group of people that met and became close.

I guess it didn't got me that much. Kinda worried/bored, I was looking in my anime folder... I saw it: K-ON! ""hey, isn't that funny one about music?""... I've decided to give it just a little preview... oh man, I watched the whole thing plus 1 more episode It was the... fourth anime I watched: 0. Lucky Star (dropped it) 1. Elfen Lied (the real first one I've truly liked) 2. Spice and Wolf (dropped, and man, I miss it, totally) 3. Suzumiya Haruhi  Things like this,  this .. THIS! the grin it caused me! ..rest is History  hehe I've never thought I would care that much about them. After you survived all these stupid, silly, dumby things; you come to realize its meaning. How they've all grown up... All that wonderful chain and friendship.  It's a jewel, a huge one.  ...after all said, I don't like how people really hate, like really hate it. I mean, you may have your own taste and all, but... objectively speaking, can you really criticize it that much? seriously. By no means: garbage haha I think it gives too many things to just label it like... welll, garbage  Half and a year has passed. Times goes on and I still love it even more and more"

In fact this might be the most probable place to find another SIF reader. It would be more surprising to find one from, for example, a science subreddit. Unfortunately no one has requested Maki.

Maybe on one of the smaller stages. I really think they'd have a shot at that. I would love it as a movie. Combine a reunion of the girls with them playing a bunch of songs live with some new ones mixed in. Just one, big K-On! farewell to the fans.  A guy can dream, right?"

k_on,2zge52,Tom555,5,Wed Mar 18 13:27:29 2015 UTC,He he he :D. This hits home to me really well. It's always weird to find out I am more attached and concerned about the school life of fictional characters than my own school life.
k_on,2zge52,TheLazyBassist,3,Wed Mar 18 14:17:50 2015 UTC,"Exact same reaction from me!  Same thing happened to me when I was playing Project Diva F 2nd and I got to the ""Sakura Rain"" song:  Me: ""sniff this is really sad""  ....  Me: ""Wait, I hated High School..."""
k_on,2zge52,coming_out,4,Wed Mar 18 20:40:10 2015 UTC,"IMO, the girls of K-On! didn't have an unrealistic high school life. Not everyone was miserable or had some tragedy befall them. Some people had a high school experience that they really enjoyed, to the point that they were sad to leave, too. That said, I was not one of them."
k_on,2zge52,10TailBeast,5,Wed Mar 18 17:15:22 2015 UTC,"Being sad because high school is ending is not particularly unrealistic, but K-on! gives a very happy extreme of it, during the entirely of k-on! they have very little to no conflicts between them, Ritsu being jelly of Mio getting Nodoka's attention might be the only one, and when Ritsu and Mio actually clash the mood of the anime changes quite abruptly.  In a normal high school life, conflicts like these are far more common, and they can easily taint the high school life, because teenagers tend to be dramatic and over dramatize dumb stuff, Ritsu was being dramatic during her jealous episode, but it gets explained as ""she just had a fever"", because K-on! wants to show extremely idealized characters, the keions do have flaws, but they are, in some way, likable flaws, Yui's dumbness and Mio's cowardice are flaws, but they come of as cute.  K-on! also completely skips the sexual part of the keions, aside from some yuri jokes regarding Mugi. Bringing actual relationships or sex into K-on! would cause a lot more drama and potential fights between the girls, it would also switch the genre of K-on! massively, so it's pretty obvious why this isn't touched upon, but it's hard to mantain that K-on! is ""realistic"" when you skip stuff like this.  I'm not bashing K-on!, it is my favorite show, and people tend to think that realistic == good, I don't, and I also don't think K-on! is realistic, it might be more realistic than Haruhi, but that isn't saying much.  TL;DR: being sad that high school ends is not unrealistic, but the high school life K-on! shows us is extremely idealized and very far from reality."
k_on,2zge52,Rithral,3,Wed Mar 18 19:41:16 2015 UTC,"people tend to think that realistic == good, I don't   I couldn't have said it better. Nice writeup."

k_on,2zge52,Rithral,3,Thu Mar 19 02:18:48 2015 UTC,"Well, that's just how the internet works, it's way easier to hate on something that is it to like it.  I won't say that K-on! is universally hated (it's quite the opposite in places like 4chan) , but there's a strong hivemind in some places about it being only a moeblob fest, so if someone wants to farm upvotes/thumbs ups/positive comments, you can always state this (it being only a moeblob fest) to get accepted by the community.  Of course, you can always try and defend K-on! against such people, but in the end, I don't think most of the persons who said this actually care about what they said nor they have any kind of strong argument to back them up, they are just trolling/shitposting, but you put yourself in a much more vulnerable position since you are defending something you have some kind of emotional attachment to.  I would have no problem answering to well constructed criticism, but haha that doesn't exist on the internet.  But I agree that seeing it bashed like that with those kinds of arguments tends to annoy me too."
k_on,2zge52,23290867,3,Thu Mar 19 02:57:34 2015 UTC,"Same here. I just stopped caring as I became busier with jobs and had less time lurking in chans. Those bills won't pay themselves. I guess there's a cycle of newcomers getting all excited and pushy who eventually mellow out and become less active as they grow older.  I'm watching less anime than before, but I try appreciating the thought behind the scenes more these days. K-on strikes me as something the creators really enjoyed making, the happiness is there and you can feel it. That's what probably made me attached."

k_on,2yk612,insomiaengineer,1 point,Tue Mar 10 22:34:17 2015 UTC,like teamspeak/skype/w.e. kind of deal?
k_on,2yk612,insomiaengineer,1 point,Wed Mar 11 00:35:34 2015 UTC,something like that. But all synched up n stuff
k_on,2yi7h5,increditoaster,9,Tue Mar 10 00:38:30 2015 UTC,"On a rewatch I'll usually tear up at the concert in ep 12 season one, ep 20 and 24 of season two, and towards the end of the movie.  During my first watch of K-on! ep 12 of S1 didn't really do much for me, probably because the characters hadn't really grown on me yet and I still didn't know what K-on! was even supposed to be about.  They tearing up and crying on EP 20 caught me completely off guard, I did not expect this show to attempt to make me cry, nor to succeed the way they did, I didn't realize how much I cared about the girls until this scene that at the time came completely out of nowhere, when Yui is talking about the things they'll do in the future, then the completely silent ambiance changes to a somewhat sad music, and by the time I realized why this conversation might be sad for them, the camera shows Ritsu and Yui with tears in their eyes, at this moment my brain went ""oh fuck I'm going to cry like a baby"" and I teared up hard.  I could keep talking about this scene, since it's so good and it portrays each keion and their personalities so well, but the point I was trying to make is that this is the time I realized I flat out loved K-on!, I was crying at this scene just because it made the girls sad, and in order for this to happen I had to really care about them, and I do.  With this said why EP24 makes me cry is pretty obvious, add  to that the fact that Azusa is my favorite girl, and she also tears up during this, which she didn't do on EP20, so it was nice to see her show her emotional side."
k_on,2yi7h5,Rithral,1 point,Tue Mar 10 02:25:01 2015 UTC,"Same here. Loved this scene so very much. My question is this, as they are crying what was the music in the background??"
k_on,2yi7h5,Rithral,1 point,Tue Mar 10 02:56:23 2015 UTC,It's this one.
k_on,2yi7h5,MediocreFPS,1 point,Tue Mar 10 03:09:32 2015 UTC,Thank you!
k_on,2yi7h5,The_Kuroi_Kenshi,1 point,Tue Mar 10 03:59:13 2015 UTC,"God, that episode. It was too much for me man, this soundtrack bringing back the feels so hard."
k_on,2yi7h5,lt13jimmy,3,Thu Mar 12 14:27:54 2015 UTC,"Never broke into tears just close to them, but after their final performance.  That just sent shivers throughout my skin.  Jesus, that was emotional."
k_on,2yi7h5,ReverseMankey,4,Tue Mar 10 01:42:52 2015 UTC,I don't know about you guys but I burst out laughing when Ritsu puts the receipt of the pawned vintage guitar in her mouth and almost eats it.
k_on,2yi7h5,Sonickku,1 point,Tue Mar 10 04:40:02 2015 UTC,same here haha ritsu is the best
k_on,2yi7h5,Sonickku,2,Tue Mar 10 06:24:43 2015 UTC,Episode 24 hit me the hardest and brought me to actual tears. It hit me hardest because I had been in Azunyan's position before when I was a Junior in high school and pretty much all my friends were Seniors. And seeing her try to be strong about it only to break down in the end made me finally break down.
k_on,2yfjm7,The_Kuroi_Kenshi,17,Mon Mar 9 11:21:43 2015 UTC,Yui is best girl.
k_on,2yfjm7,ScottFromCanada,6,Mon Mar 9 13:13:03 2015 UTC,What an awfully weird way to spell Mugi
k_on,2yfjm7,sapphiretech368,8,Mon Mar 9 20:04:15 2015 UTC,"Mugi? More like Move, g, I gotta see some more Yui."

k_on,2yfjm7,sapphiretech368,6,Mon Mar 9 23:08:13 2015 UTC,"So, you just threw away like 138 ""daily k-on!'s"" to make these albums?"
k_on,2yfjm7,guislavi,6,Mon Mar 9 15:38:39 2015 UTC,"You can put that way, sure!  For me, it wasn't about the karma at any point of the series. It was more of the thought, ""I wonder what /r/k_on is gonna like.""  I usually sit here everyday, and at some point in the day stare at my computer screen think which image to post.  The karma to me is the feedback. If it's high, then people like images similar to the one posted for that day. If it's not, then I should probably avoid something similar to the post of that day.  I just love the feel of a community."
k_on,2yfjm7,guislavi,1 point,Mon Mar 9 20:40:08 2015 UTC,"So, you're doing it right! Look all those comments and participation in your posts! I mean, you're helping to keep the /r/k_on stronger than ever"

As mentiomed before, I saved these from the artist Ikari Manatsu.  A Ritsu album would probably be compiled of different pictures from different artists which won't be a problem for me.  I just thought people prefered something like this where there are photos from the same artist.  Well, I'll leave it up to you and the other members of /r/k_on.  Do you guys want a Ritsu album for tomorrow's daily post or just something at random?"

k_on,2xow12,UltimateEpicFailz,4,Mon Mar 2 18:07:05 2015 UTC,Lovely song. dat instrumentation My fav version is the cassete version. I love how Mio sounds there. But it lacks the gorgeous decorations.  I enjoy the powerful guitar right before the solo. The backup voices. The synth haha gotta love Tsumugi! she rocks :)  ...too bad the S2ep1 version it's hard to get meh
k_on,2xow12,Sonickku,3,Mon Mar 2 19:56:14 2015 UTC,"I love the guitar intro in the cassette version. It has something different from the studio one that's just so much better. Dunno, maybe the cassette version has that roughness that makes it sound more ""real""?"
k_on,2xow12,nikidash,3,Mon Mar 2 21:30:23 2015 UTC,":o you're right.. I didn't notice it that much before. Tough, that's exactly the main reason why I love so much the cassette CD"
k_on,2xow12,Sonickku,3,Mon Mar 2 22:52:51 2015 UTC,"Death Devil sounds good next week!  As for this song, I like Yui's solo version best. The original song is good, but there's just something about Yui's solo that makes it distinct."

But which order should I follow? Problem is, I've got Mio, Azusa and Ritsu versions coming soon, this sounds kind of not fun, 5 videos of the same song in a row is too much, don't you think?  Maybe I should upload all 5 for each song and then post the playlist here.  Another idea: shuffle everything and post it in random order until the full list (all songs x all characters) is completed."
k_on,2xmfpt,UltimateEpicFailz,2,Mon Mar 2 02:51:34 2015 UTC,"I'd say posting the playlist is a better choice than posting 5 seperate videos for each song, yeah. You could just simply post one then link the other versions in the comments as another way.  I look forward to seeing the rest of the songs, keep up the good work!"

Youtube is full of rather shitty PSP recordings with terrible sound quality, I haven't seen any PS3 recordings yet.  There's a slight problem though, I suck. As you can see, I've got 2 bad notes in this run, I rarely miss but keeping up a huge combo is sometimes impossible for me.  Any suggestions for future uploads are welcomed!"

This day has been a roller coaster of everything nice and everything really not so nice and I'm not feeling too happy about this drifting helplessness. People have been kind and people have been rude. But then there is Mugi.  Every tangled thought is washed away and only a very happy person is left behind. This is truly the power of... THE eyebrows. How shall I return the favour The_Kuroi_Kenshi? Name your terms :D

k_on,2wv54i,PM_ME_YOUR_CAT_,3,Mon Feb 23 12:46:18 2015 UTC,I wonder if Yui has a Nodoka toy.
k_on,2wv54i,Marv134,2,Mon Feb 23 21:21:00 2015 UTC,Probably a dakimakura.
k_on,2wv54i,FomorianKing,2,Tue Feb 24 01:33:40 2015 UTC,It kinda reminds me of Non Non Biyori.

k_on,2wvu1o,UltimateEpicFailz,8,Mon Feb 23 16:37:47 2015 UTC,This is another of the songs that make me grin like an idiot... mostly because of Yui's voice.

Love the live version (I forgot how the Yui version sounds haha)  Hehe at first, I remember I didn't hype that much about it... until I learned it and realize how fun and catchy it is  :B It's powerful Too bad I can't sing (dang that sucks)"
k_on,2wvu1o,patsuan,5,Mon Feb 23 17:18:36 2015 UTC,My favorite song from HTT. I catch myself playing the intro riff everytime I touch a guitar. Cassette mix version is the best.

After that, continue watching the rest of season 2 up to AND INCLUDING episode 21 then watch episode 25 because that episode is set after episode 21.     After that, watch episode 22 then episode 26 and finally, just finish off the season 2 then watch the movie.     TL;DR: S1, S1 OVA, S2 (up to EP13), S2 OVA, S2 (up to EP21), EP25, EP22, EP26, S2 (up to EP24), movie."

k_on,2wf736,TheLazyBassist,4,Thu Feb 19 12:01:11 2015 UTC,"The story I understood from the picture: Ritsu wanted to show two magic tricks, one being an optical illusion and the other a sleight of hand. First it (poorly :D) seems like Ritsu is holding that girl in her hand and she then attempts to change the girl into a strawberry, but the girl walks up to the strawberry ruining the already not-too-impressive optical illusion. Ritsu's spirit is however not crushed as she announces the magical words ""Ta dah-!"" with just the strawberry in her hands! Truly, genuinely magical."

First off, the second and third pictures are in the wrong order so switch them around and it makes much more sense. Anywho, Ritsu is performing a transformation-esque magic trick. The girl in the background is a minor character named Ichigo, and Ritsu transforms her into a strawberry in which the Japanese term for strawberry is well - Ichigo. After you switch the second and third picture around, you'll see that she didn't actually perform any magic trick and makes that ""shit, you got me"" look haha. Hope this clarifies things for ya."
k_on,2wf736,23290867,2,Thu Feb 19 23:05:29 2015 UTC,OHHHHHHHHHH  I knew who she is but I never knew Ichigo was strawberry in Japanese!  Dang this is some next level humor.

After that, continue watching the rest of season 2 up to AND INCLUDING episode 21 then watch episode 25 because that episode is set after episode 21.     After that, watch episode 22 then episode 26 and finally, just finish off the season 2 then watch the movie.

So when I heard that my friend really liked an anime about some high school girls in a band, I thought: ""well that must be boring"". But my curiosity got the best of me, so I decided to watch the first episode. Fast forward a few weeks later and I've already watched every episode including the movie, and am now driving my car, making pizza deliveries with Fuwa Fuwa Time, and Hiraki full blast. Honestly, I didn't expect much from this show at the start, which made all the little moments so much more. I knew the ending would be emotional but I honestly didn't expect to cry as much as I did (notably with the ending of S2E20, when the girls are in the club room after the last school festival performance). This anime actually made me pick up my guitar for the first time in years. My only problem with this anime is that there aren't anymore episodes."

k_on,2tm0ot,Ninoaguila,2,Mon Jan 26 16:03:31 2015 UTC,"I understand what you mean. When I first heard about this show, I avoided it because some people were calling it ""moeblobshit"" and so I assumed it would not be fitting to my tastes.

k_on,2szlm1,trambe25,2,Tue Jan 20 03:32:24 2015 UTC,Hmm. I think it might have been a one-off joke they made that they then called backed to in the second beach episode. I'm not certain though.

Maybe the joke is that it's just random and there is no meaning to it."

When I first listened to it, it remind me of... these old songs from old cartoons like, I don't know, Tom & Jerry? Disney?? Somehow haha. Childhood was lovely nyaa The acoustic guitar, I love that.  My favourite part is the ending, dat piano :3  oh no, now I rembember. I came for this song randomly on Youtube.... It was in japanese, so I didn't understand anything. I first thought it was somekind of fanvid, fansong, AMV, whatever, fan stuff  Chorus got my attention. ""i-is that Yui?? really??"" First times were weird. ""how lovely!"" ""is this an actual K-ON song??"" hehe I couldn't believe the sound  yeah, I love it. It always cheer me up. Kinda like Ichiban Ippai... difference? this fits my personal taste quite good :]  (..bad thing is I can't figure how to play the actual whole song on guitar, from start to finish... there are many piano, violin umm.. mostly at the middle, where I stop haha)"
k_on,2s6qif,Sonickku,3,Mon Jan 12 19:40:10 2015 UTC,"Totally crossing fandoms here, but this song really reminds me of ""Dear My Friend,"" which is the ending theme of Sonic Unleashed. Though this song is noticeably more joyful than Dear My Friend, I really enjoy the style of these songs.  This one is really different from the rest of HTT's repertoire, but it's really nice, and I like the songs where everyone gets a chance to sing."

k_on,2s6u08,TWILIGHT_IS_AWESOME,8,Mon Jan 12 18:34:34 2015 UTC,K-on is honestly the one show where i just can't find any character i dislike. I just love'em all
k_on,2s6u08,nikidash,7,Mon Jan 12 19:22:31 2015 UTC,"Jun.  Her character doesn't seem more than just being bitchy and jealous about everything the keion bu does even though she didn't join when she had the chance.  She also holds back Azusa and Ui cute interactions as she being in the vicinity forces Azusa to act mature and cold instead of actually talking about her feelings about the keion bu, which she would absolutely share with Ui alone. (I.E Their conversation on the fast food restaurant on S1 when Azusa goes to the ""training"" camp, their talk while try to sleep on S02EP05, etc)  While Azusa closed nature is arguably her fault, she still brings much more to the table and having this fault prevents her from being a mary sue character.  Jun, on the other hand, is mostly useless to K-on! and drags Azusa and Ui down."
k_on,2s6u08,Rithral,2,Tue Jan 13 00:14:58 2015 UTC,I think she's really cute and dorky. Maybe the bitchiness doesn't come off as much in the dubbed version of the show.
k_on,2s6u08,AlexMeanberg,4,Tue Jan 13 02:44:57 2015 UTC,There is no least favorite character. Every k-on character has their own little level of moe greatness. Every character is best character.

k_on,2s6u08,meandthestereo,2,Mon Jan 12 22:24:40 2015 UTC,"Isn't Mugi the one who provides treats and tea instead of Mio?  Also, it's a very hard decision, but I'd have to say Mugi. It seems that she gets less air time than the others, and that's probably the reason she's my least favorite.  She is still completely awesome, though. Even my least favorite character is great. That's just how good K-On! is."

Mugi fits that, but hey! I like her in K-ON ! case. As Ritsu quoted her in... I think S1E06. Geez you can't  hate sweet Mugs  Another stereotype that can annoy me are the ones like Sawako. While sometimes annoying to be serious, I tolerate her very much... Ummm going a bit deeper?? It has to be that Sawako alike character from the manga... don't remember her name."

I don't hate Mio, but I also don't like her. She's quite cute, but Yui > Mio imo."

Also, the guitar wasnt plugged in. However, at the songs before the encore, they were really playing for real. They were really concentrating, and their fingers and hand movements actually matched the music. The tempo was slower too, as they were concentrating so much. Hope this helps!"

k_on,2rj4pf,nikidash,2,Tue Jan 6 17:58:33 2015 UTC,"Well, I recommend watching it just because it's good but you wont see any band stuff. They don't practice. They only play a few live shows and we don't get to see much of that either. I don't really think it's just for moe though. It's slice of life stuff. You just follow the girls through their lives. The first season is kinda childish with the weird anime stuff but it gets more serious after that. Although, even so, there's some good stories in the first season."

k_on,2rf36x,UltimateEpicFailz,2,Mon Jan 5 17:39:55 2015 UTC,"Love all the OSTs from K-ON! Theres some great mellow stuff, as well as more upbeat electronic tracks like train D"
k_on,2rf36x,RamJackal,2,Mon Jan 5 19:50:42 2015 UTC,Much fun was had to this tune.
k_on,2rf36x,AlexMeanberg,2,Mon Jan 5 23:26:19 2015 UTC,"So moody.  Even if I say ""meh"" (I put 3 starts on my playlist), I find myself ocassionaly humming it! Relax, so K-ONish, I praise that :)"
k_on,2rdr8b,MediocreFPS,5,Mon Jan 5 07:21:06 2015 UTC,This episode was a bit confusing. Sawachan didn't know that a guitar would be worth a lot of money?? Even a standard used SG would still sell for at least $1000 or more. Is she so rich that she doesn't want/need that money?  Also odd that they didn't find that guitar in the FIRST ep when Yui needed one! Didn't anyone look? The first thing I'd do is rummage through the closets and see what we had!
k_on,2rdr8b,ScottFromCanada,5,Mon Jan 5 15:03:55 2015 UTC,"More moe less logic.  But yeah, I was thinking the same thing."
k_on,2rdr8b,The_Sign_Painter,4,Mon Jan 5 17:07:27 2015 UTC,"I'll try to defend K-ON's lacking logic as much as possible but it mostly is just more moe haha.  Sawa-chan forgot about that guitar which was why she was surprised that it was found in the closet. Funny that she was using her Epiphone Flying V in another episode while she had forgotten about a better Gibson.  I'm thinking that she didn't think it would be worth a lot of money because she's dumb and underestimated it haha. You are totally right that a standard Gibson SG used would sell for a lot. She probably just assumed it was moldy or something.  Either way, like what was said before, ""More moe less logic"" heh."
k_on,2rdr8b,AndrewBlackSwordsman,2,Mon Jan 5 19:35:52 2015 UTC,"Which reminds me... moldy guitars!?? Never heard of such a thing! You'd just wipe it off!!   Anyway, you don't just forget about expensive guitars! And I doubt a teacher would be making so much she would just donate the money to the club!   BUT... doesn't matter. It just bugged me a bit. Moe... Moe... Moe... Moe... Moe... Moe... Moe... Moe... Moe... Moe... Moe..."
k_on,2rdr8b,ScottFromCanada,1 point,Mon Jan 5 20:34:36 2015 UTC,Another thing: she learnt the chords for pure pure heart in the timestamp where yui went to get her guitar...

The song playing there is One More Tea (Have Some Tea on the wiki)! This is the first song on the OST, so I guess they wanted to finish it how they started! Man, I love this soundtrack...
