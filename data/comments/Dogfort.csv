Dogfort,31kcye,Edmonty,7,Mon Apr 6 08:54:37 2015 UTC,Or was it a vision of things to come. Red Lobster's combat prowess has now been transformed into becoming an oracle. The real question is whether or not he can change the future or if he is cursed to simply witness it like Casandra. Only time will tell...
