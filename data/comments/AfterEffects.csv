You need a solid foundation in the basics first (see the sidebar), but once you do, my hints should push you the right direction.  I mean, look at it more discerningly - it's a very simple animation. There is a background layer, a layer with particles, a layer with the logo, and a layer with the flare. The logo layer is set to be 3d. The camera moves a bit and the flares kinda wander through. That's it."

Technically speaking, you're infringing on the copyright of the photographer, the image rights of the player, and the trademarks of the team / league he plays for, but since it'll be recontextualized under a silhouette, its unlikely anyone notices. But, to be clear, the recontextualization does not forgive you of any wrongdoing. Fair use is an iffy defense that is subject to the whims and understanding of the judge it's brought before, and there really are no cut and dry guidelines on what is or isn't fair use.   That's why a client would care: they own whatever you're making, and are liable if the photographer brings a lawsuit against you, and copyright cases are long and expensive affairs."

Or certain third-party effects. Red Giant's Universe, Element 3d, Mettle's ShapeShifter, etc.  Processor speed is most important for rendering time. It's good to have 4 GB of RAM per core of processor. Having an SSD for the cache speeds up working with AE quite a bit."
AfterEffects,3e080d,TheGreatSzalam,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:52:37 2015 UTC,If you're using HD footage or smaller and have lots of RAM (16gb+) and CPU cores (above 4) then you will likely get a boost from enabling multi-frame rendering.   Aside from that there's not much.  You can hit CAPSLOCK before render so it doesn't update the viewport while it goes.  That usually gives a small bump.

AfterEffects,3dvnba,TheGreatSzalam,3,Sun Jul 19 22:27:28 2015 UTC,You could also parent everything to a null and move the null around.

You can slice up the image into a grid of more reasonable sized images. Then bring them in as a comp. Make sure you check the ""retain layer size"" box. Having the blend mode on Alpha Add with prevent some seams from showing up. Parenting them all to one null would probably be useful as well.  Not sure how much render time it'll save you.

Im pretty sure i tried to recreate these more than once when i started out and at some point it began to make sense."
AfterEffects,3dterq,DjentDjentThall,2,Sun Jul 19 08:22:07 2015 UTC,"I used this channel a lot when learning AE, just keep following the summits and that will teach you a lot of different techniques which you can use to your advantage. For your first AE project i'd recommend starting with some simple shapes, perhaps brought in from Illustrator/Photoshop, and i'd learn the basic functions, e.g, scaling, positioning, rotation. Once you feel comfortable enough with those, learn about the speed graph, and how you can alter the way the basic functions are happening.    After that i'd then begin to look for some basic plugins, that speed up your workflow, stuff like the ""Move Anchor Point"" and ""Eaze and Wizz"".  Then after that, it's all up to you. You need to think which direction you're going to go in, will it be VFX or Motion Graphics, 2D/3D/Both?  So yeah, that's pretty much all of my input."
AfterEffects,3dterq,ScottW51,3,Sun Jul 19 09:03:13 2015 UTC,"When I taught AE at university I would have them do 4 projects.  1: lower 3rd animate in and out 2: animated logo 3: a special effects shot (light sabers, explosions, green screen comping, etc) and 4: kinetic typography."
AfterEffects,3dterq,videomissile,2,Sun Jul 19 17:17:27 2015 UTC,"Just playing around in AE is an excellent way to start. Have a good old go at the effects and mess with things to see how they work and mish and mash all of 'em together - but understand that if you're concept/idea is weak, then no matter what the effects are that you thrown at it, the concept will still be weak.  That being said it's a lot of fun to just mess around because you need to learn and you don't need to make gold every time as long as you're figuring out concepts that you can apply later. I recommend you have an idea of what you want to create before you start because that way, you'll know when you're done and can start on the next thing.  Top-tip #1: try to get to about 90%; the last 10% will take just as long as the first 90% and it won't give you that much more.  Following tutorials is like an expedited excursion into mish-mash land but usually a very specialized trip.  If you look out to the left, you'll see light sweeps, if you look out to the right, you can just spot chromatic abberation. Ah, here we are at our destination - 3D titles in space. This trip was sponsored by Andrew Kramer.  The possibilities are endless and you really need to branch out as you're doing tutorials to see what else you can do - this takes a lot of time and a lot of playing around. Which is fine - nobody starts out a pro.  Top-tip 2: It's ok to follow tutorials but it's not ok to show people the stuff you made following a tutorial and go ""look at this, I made this"" (especially to people who are going to know the tutorial because they've probably followed or at least skipped through it at one point in their work).  It'll help you a lot if you have a sense of design and know what is aesthetically pleasing - composition, lighting, contrast. All the things you can apply in photography and drawing will be applicable to a degree in motion design / AE stuff. There are a ton of things google will provide in any of these aspects and again, it's nice to have hobbies.   Top-tip 3: Google is your friend. If you're having issues, google that stuff. It's highly likely other people have had the same issue and will have found a solution before you. Learn how to google effectively. (First lesson, google ""how to google effectively"" (without the quotes))  Typography knowledge helps a ton (i.e. don't stretch your words/letters to make them fit - change the font or change the kerning but don't stretch your fonts). Know how to match fonts and don't be afraid to use colours in work. Again, lettering has been around for ages and the multitude of tutorials out there will get you on your path.  For animation, look at old disney cartoons, grab a few cool documentaries and have a go at understanding how they did what they did. Alternatively the key words you want to follow up are: ""12 animation principles"" and ""curve editor"". I keep linking to these videos whenever anyone asks stuff about stuff concerning motion, because they sum it up the best. Motion Curves & Animating Follow-through.  Top-tip 4: School of Motion (.com) has some pretty cool tutorials up as well.  But yeah, there's always /r/AfterEffects if things are not working and you're not sure why and need people to ask. Mostly friendly, sometimes dickish but only sometimes. Assume that everyone was where you are at one point and keep posting what you make so people can put you down but understand that it's all part of the process and roll onward.  Pro-tip 5: This, just all of this (The Gap quote by Ira Glass)"

I kind of wish the models would have interacted with the world a bit more. You have one swimming for a little bit, but the rest of it is just them kinda moving.

They are close friends of mine so it's likely we will work again and develop the aesthetic further so thanks for the input.

AfterEffects,3drbjk,Paubro,3,Sat Jul 18 18:30:42 2015 UTC,"Loved it. Great idea for a short film and really well done.  Couple of things. The camera movement in the first interview scene is too jerky. The movements are too small and rapid. It nearly made me turn it off before anything interesting happened. The rest of the film had a camera that was jerky, but the movements were smoother and larger, and fit the mood of the piece.  The motion tracking is a tiny bit screwy on several shots. One of the shots of a character's head slipped as the camera panned and the screen contents don't stay on the monitor when the guard is shaking the screen. There are a few other tiny little slips here and there, but I only noticed because I was looking for them.  If this was a college project you did with some friends, it's a great piece. I got a little spooked out. I kind of wish it were a few minutes longer to let you build the suspense and maybe give him a better reason to leave the office."

I liked the acting and the concept -- I mean, who hasn't been freaked out by Chuck e cheez animatronics?!?!!  I was legit scared at some points!  I have some CC:  in the first 0-3 minutes, you can trim a lot of fat here.  Pauses, saying things twice, etc.  It was a little drawn out and I felt a little impatient.  -When he's on the phone with the manager, you can cut some of the end of their convo out to make it more subtle.  You can cut 'Are they trying to kill me?"" (or whatever was similar)...   -Again I really liked the acting.  The only thing I didn't like was when he said ""what kind of place is this?"" several times.  You don't need it -- especially cut it when he says it at 6:10.  It felt really scripted... but all the cursing felt right on!  -The animatronic audio still sounds really human.  Warp those sounds up, man, make them spooky and robotey! Or... robotier.  -6:25 the teeth wouldn't have that light hitting them.  Nor would that mouth have any light inside -- in general the animatronics are too well-described visually -- make them a lot more shadowy.  It would look more realistic in terms of the fact that he's watching it on a shitty camera, and it'll be scarier.  -7:04 - his 'Oh, no' sounds like a 'I just locked my keys in the car' oh no, not like 'Going to get murdered by robot' oh,no  -I don't totally understand why he left the room.  Does the low power mean the lock unlocks, a la Jurassic park?  if so, you may have to SHOW it... because even if the lights went out, I wouldn't leave that friggin room!  -8:24/25 -- You need to generate shadows from the flashlight! I assumed they were CGI because he was going to try to put them on and pretend to be animatronic himself.  But since he doesn't you should just get a real mask and re-shoot.  -When it's attacking him, there's a sortof slow zoom in his face, that you should either cut or DRASTICALLY speed up / shorten to a flash.

Out of curiosity, is there something in the static? it looks like there could be, but if not, a static distorted image of the Crying Clown or Golden Freddy for a couple frames could be a great addition.  There could be a little less of a pause between some of the Phone Guy's responses to the security guard, like he's anticipating the guards responses, making viewers question if he's really on the phone, or if it's a recording, like in the game.   For some who don't know the game, maybe put in a reason for why he rand, like a V.O. of the guard saying ""I wont be able to keep the door locked without power"" or ""I can't track them!"" or even just the sound effect of the door unlocking once the screen blacks out, something like that."

AfterEffects,3dprbg,mohaukachi,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:41:21 2015 UTC,"I took this photo and brought it into PS to remove the road, isolate the tree trunks and rocks, add more foreground foliage, and do a day for night color grade. The trick that really helped this one out is that I used the dodge and burn tools to really accent the highlights and shadows to give me much more contrast on the objects. Then I brought all the elements into AE and added layers of particular in between so that the particles would be behind by the various trunks and rocks and give a sense of more depth. Then I brought my final render back into PS and played around in the save for web dialogue to create the pixelated effect. For this one I used the adaptive color reduction algorithm with only 64 colors with the dither set to noise. Then I reduced the image size to 250x250px with the quality set to nearest neighbor. When I brought it back into AE to scale it up make sure you have the gif layer set to draft quality otherwise AE with try to interrupt in between pixels and you will get a blurry mess.  EDIT: This is what it looked like before bringing it into PS to add the pixelated effect."

AfterEffects,3dkc7g,billions_of_stars,7,Thu Jul 16 23:41:07 2015 UTC,Thank you so much! Really appreciate your time and kind words. In terms of the 3D stuff - All the 3D sections are made from flat 2D layers rotated/placed in 3D space. So no element/c4d used.  Even the desk/chair at the beginning is done this way.. I had no idea how that was going to turn out but am relieved it did as it ties in with the branding of the Single artwork. Thanks again! :)

AfterEffects,3dkc7g,billions_of_stars,2,Fri Jul 17 00:10:31 2015 UTC,"In regards to the 3D, you're right! I create one layer/precomp that had the texture of the side of the log, and another precomp that had the end/stumps of the log. Making sure the dimension matched, I would place (and duplicate) the layers into a shape of an unfolded 3D cuboid (google image those exact words for visuals). Then after parenting some of the layers together, I could rotate the layers (in 3D space) which would end up turning into a cuboid. Kind of a digital origami would be a good visual way to describe it. Does that make sense? It's difficult to explain sometimes!"

I recommend downloading a script that allows you to snap the anchor point to a specific edge of the shape (so you don't have to line it up yourself.. something like mt.mographs motion is a great script) and then you just parent the layers together and start rotating! They should stay attached and lined up. If you have any more questions I'll happily answer!

I have a real thing for low poly art which helps out, but I definitely have to find the time to get into the more heavy CG stuff.  You actually completely caught me out, and I only just figured - the halftone is actually an external image used and keyed.. So i guess that isn't native AE. My bad! However if you wanted to do it straight in the program, you could either do it the long way by repeating lots of circle shapes, or use a 3rd party plug in like Trapcode Form to create a base of particles!"

AfterEffects,3dkc7g,SilentWOLF9,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:32:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks!! So I started learning After effects almost four years ago, as I wanted to enter a music video competition for a band I liked. I learnt it from scratch by initially watching some tutorials, just to see how people navigated around the work space and then from there I just did what felt right! It's SUCH a cliche to say, but practice helps a lot. The more familiar you become with the program, the more you know how to use it and what it can do. You've definitely got the right attitude, it's all about doing it because you want to! :) Also, Youtube 'A Lot Like Birds - Think Dirty Out Loud'. It's the first video I made, and I ended up winning!"

AfterEffects,3dnakl,rahmad,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:43:05 2015 UTC,"again, you're asking for a general answer when the right answer is: use the right tool for the job:   expressions are very powerful but systemic. the timeline allows for simple precision.  the right answer is: use both and over time you'll learn when to use each."

Since I don't consider myself a 3D animator, I typically buy/find existing models online if I need something for my projects and use E3D to bring them into my AE project.  My E3D preference is solely based on the fact that I started using it before C4DL was bundled and because I feel like it's a little faster on the render.

If you need to change something, you have 2 options -   1) Do what you are doing.   2) (To continue using the arm/hand example) Draw the arm and hand combo in a new illustrator file. Import that.

AfterEffects,3dc6yf,marsjmc,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:18:33 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the white on yellow, I think it's fine.   For a first animation, good work! It shows understanding of principle but execution leaves a little to be desired.   So, let me break down my crit:  Overall, some things feel a little sticky. For instance, the very first word that slides in feels a little rigid. Personally, I'd add a very slight bounce to it. I get the feeling this is meant to be a little fun and playful so try and extend that to you animation. Inertial Bounce expressions are very handy (I use this page in almost every project).   Having said that it seems as though you've used it on the 'Party game for creative thinking' part of the text. This feels like it just appears. My advice, move your anchor point a little higher, maybe to the bottom of the K in think, and rotate on this axis a little further so you get some real swing into it. Also, stretch out the length of the layer so that you can see it swinging in.   Something that's really bugging me is the text that appears on screen. I'm not sure if certain words are meant to be bigger or if this is just an aesthetic. It's not working for me when I watch it. I would knock the timing back a bit and provide your text in 'blocks'. With similar videos I have made for work clients, I've found often it's easiest read when everything is in a block. This means you can increase the size of certain lines to make it match up.   Definitely take care with the length of some of your layers too. Noticeably right at the end:   Players have one minute to  .... ... .. . Write their etc etc  That break is odd for me. I get what you might have been going for, but really, if you're gonna put all that on screen, do it in a way that allows the viewer to keep reading, don't let them stop at an awkward point.   There might be more, but for now that's just some basic (if lengthy) advice or critique. I'm sure some might disagree, but I know when I look for feedback, I rarely find anything of note, so hopefully in providing you some, you'll take it away and act on it.   Mind, what I've said isn't gospel; If YOU like a part that I don't, don't feel pressured to change it. Just make sure it works, especially if you're trying to sell/advertise a product"

AfterEffects,3dc6yf,DrFeck,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:22:38 2015 UTC,"Looks good! One thing that might help: The text that slides in at about 0:13 (players think...) slowly moves as the tabs pop up, which works well. I would consider adding similar slow movement to any text which stays on screen for more than a second. Not just slow slides (which may look strange when texts pops from the top or bottom) but things like gradually increasing the tracking or the size of certain words can make an animation feel a little more fluid."

I mean its not perfect and has quite a few imperfections in the transitions but good enough that he must be able to see relatively well.  At any rate, what he's doing is using the liquify tool to move portions of the piece, then transitions back to the original.  The real talent here is in the original images, some beautiful work there, shame a blind guy making gifs out of the original works is getting all the attention."

Pros: Pretty decent flares. Cheaper cost upfront.  Cons: Universe/Knoll Light Factory is strictly 2D to be host app agnostic, so it will not respond to 3D lights without expressions.

It's a pretty simple tool if you don't know how to use it, just use it once and you'll understand how it works. In this image, the only thing behind the foreground tree was the leaves of the trees in the background, so I just used the clone stamp tool to clone the part of the leaves on the bg trees I could see over the foreground tree. The trick is to sample from all the visible parts of the trees so it doesn't look like it's repeating, don't just go from the bottom up or left to right.

The team at Adobe has said that they are looking into various technologies. They even demonstrated some acceleration of a few effects using Metal on the upcoming version of Mac OS at Apple's most recent World Wide Developer's Conference.

AfterEffects,3d1c9z,TheRealYellowClaw,3,Sun Jul 12 20:14:52 2015 UTC,"thank you! No real tutorial, but here's basically what I did.  I duplicated the text layer 4 times. I kept one of them just as text, and applied a displacement map (I used a random shaky video I found on my SD card for the map) and a mosaic effect to the other 3. One of the three displaced layers I kept just as white text, the other two I turned off some of the color channels to make them appear cyan and red. Then I just keyframed out the horizontal/vertical displacements and the number of tiles in the mosaic differently on each of the 3 layers to give it a chaotic look. I used some masks for more variety (specifically the same mask on the plain text and the white glitching text to only have part of it moving while the rest stays static)."

AfterEffects,3d1xl6,algrensan,3,Sun Jul 12 21:28:56 2015 UTC,"So, I'm not an expert but I have a theory based on my own experience and observing life. And using a bit of my engineering background.  My theory is that everything that is related to human interaction is under the Uncanny Valley principle. Article TL;DR: The empathy that someone have to other someone (or something, in case of a robot or a cartoon) is proportional to its similarity to a healthy human. But there is a small gap near the 80-90% that the empathy goes negative. This is true for human look-a-likeness (does this word exists?). BUT, after some years observing, I noticed that this is true for A LOT of things. And animation is one of these things.  If you haven't see the The Illusion of Life video, stop reading this right now, go watch it and then come back. As you could see, those are realistic movement. Ok, they are exaggerated, but this made us feel the cube so alive that you could build a whole history with him and if it has a sad ending, I'm sure you would feel bad. Because of the empathy. The more you make it look natural and realistic, the more empathy people will feel. But be careful with the Uncanny Valley!  If you want to make something pleasant to the eyes, just keep in mind these things and what you want to do. Sometimes, a fast start and then slowing the movement (like if it started at the middle of your screenshot) is better for transmitting the feeling of that it was coming from a distance. Our maybe a sudden stop is better than constant slowing down for a wall hit. But remember the valley! Almost nothing fully stops from a frame to another! It will feel weird. The famous feeling of ""There is something wrong but I don't know what it is"".  The Google's design guideline for material design nailed it! A read through it may improve your understanding and, maybe, your animations too!  Sorry for the potentially bad english. This is not my native language and I'm not fluent at it yet."
AfterEffects,3d1xl6,bestknighter,2,Mon Jul 13 04:45:45 2015 UTC,"Uncanny valley:       The uncanny valley is a hypothesis in the field of aesthetics which holds that when features look and move almost, but not exactly, like natural beings, it causes a response of revulsion among some observers. The ""valley"" refers to the dip in a graph of the comfort level of beings as subjects move toward a healthy, natural likeness described in a function of a subject's aesthetic acceptability. Examples can be found in the fields of robotics  and 3D computer animation,   among others.

AfterEffects,3d1xl6,bestknighter,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:10:19 2015 UTC,"Really? That is quite unexpected for me. My bet is that the ease and wizz curve are closer to the real life's way of being and the huge difference between both curves are caused by the Uncanny Valley. Could you post a gif or a video with a simple animation comparison between these curves? If yes, I suggest a side by side type of comparison. Any animation serves."
