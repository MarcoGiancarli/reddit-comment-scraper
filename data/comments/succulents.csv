Vicious cycle that won't be stopped.  Even on this sub there was someone promoting their shop that sells terrariums.  There will always be someone making it and always someone willing to buy it unfortunately.    Just like the weekly ""Hey these plants are painted at X store"" posts.  Nothing makes me cringe more and more likely than not there is at least 1 person in the thread asking how to save them.  Here's how to save them: stop buying these disasters and get real plants and see them thrive.  Maybe when they stop being bought, they'll stop stocking them.  A novel idea, indeed.  When you see a healthy plant that was grown by you, you won't go back to this trash.  Sorry if this came off harsh :D"

succulents,3e2a75,swassie,3,Tue Jul 21 12:24:10 2015 UTC,"They are actually the worst. At the beginning of summer this year I tried to make one (before I started really researching succulents) and of course they all ended up withering away. BUT it wasn't a total loss! I started learning about succulents and so I propagated almost all of the leaves. Gonna end up with 10+ extra succulents from my fail, woot!   (P.S. Propagating must be the best feeling ever haha)"
succulents,3e2a75,ChurchOfGWB,2,Tue Jul 21 19:16:05 2015 UTC,"I'm in a very similar boat as you.  I had to learn about succulents because my girlfriend wanted some and was professing how little attention/anything they needed.  Well, when they started wilting, I had to start learning.  A month or so later, we were getting pretty interested in succulents/plants generally.  We had these glass containers, like vases, that we thought would look really good with succulents in them.  Fast forward a couple months, and things weren't going so well.  Additionally, we had put together two arrangements with drainage holes but they weren't doing very well either.  Ended up switching apartments, ditched the north facing apartment for an east facing one, and repotted every single succulent I had into its own individual pot that was just the right size for each one respectively.  Also got a crash course on propagating, which definitely is a pretty awesome feeling when that one dying succulent is now five growing ones.  Once that change happened, everything took such a notable turn for the better.  Lesson learned, arrangements are more complicated than they look."

succulents,3e2a75,Pushrestart,2,Tue Jul 21 18:58:21 2015 UTC,"The way I see the terrarium trend, is just that, a trend. One can argue that plants look more aesthetically pleasing and balanced in a terrarium, BUT its not a sustainable growing environment. Most terrariums/ enclosed growing glass containers may work for the very lucky or the very experienced grower who might know how to balance variables. For the new grower though these glass dodecahedrons of death provide minimal air flow, excessive water retention, and often not enough light. And its a cycle, you get one, put your plants in and they die, then try again and again.  If someone is looking at it as an art installation then maybe it doesnt matter, but for someone looking to grow and maintain their plants in the long run, these things are not it ."

I use either (Al's) gritty mix or a mix of pumice and cherrystone grit for most plants though, both of which drain very well and dry out quickly. A lot of people have problems in plastic because their mix is too water retentive.

From my experience, the leaf/cutting/etc you use to propagate typically ends up looking like its in pretty bad shape once the new growth is gaining momentum.  I don't think it's rot, but I'm not the most knowledgable yet.  Also, I don't think one weekend would cause rot, rather frequent watering over a period of time would."

I don't know how good they are about shipping specimens (I think their most of their business is wholesale, and some in-store retail), but it's worth a call.  And if you ever are in the Monterey Bay area, it's worth a stop!"
succulents,3dyq2o,BeardCulture,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:52:14 2015 UTC,"I use this not the exact same one but something very similar.  It's not 100% enclosed so the moisture level isn't really something you need to be worried about, I don't think at least.  There are smaller versions too, since I doubt you'd need all that space just for propagation.  Overall it works pretty well, lets me keep my succulents out of the rain since not all of them are in a perfectly draining mix yet.  The only downside is spacing between shelves isn't a lot.  If you have taller plants they just won't fit, but if you're just doing propagation it's fine, and probably overkill unless you're adding plants in there along with doing cuttings.    If you continue the DIY route, and it is fully enclosed, you'll definitely need to monitor the humidity/moisture"
succulents,3dyq2o,whats_yours,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:34:27 2015 UTC,"cool, well thank you i am not done building it yet so I can very easily add a little ventilation for moisture, it also has a opening lid and i can leave it open and let it dry if need be. thanks for the response."
succulents,3dyq2o,Souperhans,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:50:50 2015 UTC,"Depends how seriously you want to propagate, any sort of greenhouse will help greatly if you maintain it right.  The added/stored heat will help roots strike and plants grow quicker plus it keeps everything together and organised.  You will need to be mindful of pests as they can spread easily since the greenhouse emulates the perfect conditions for some of them (aphid, scale,  mealy bug).  I check my greenhouses every second day or two,  it's not that much effort once you get the hang of it :)"

succulents,3dx13t,potatoninja,3,Mon Jul 20 06:13:39 2015 UTC,It really sucks that these places keep painting and gluing flowers to these cacti. What is the point?
succulents,3dx13t,madalork,2,Mon Jul 20 16:01:49 2015 UTC,"I think the colours are attention grabbing and would fit into a lot of (hipster-y) homes. It might get someone who isn't particularly interested in cacti and succulents to learn more about them and get into them. Costa farms says their paint isn't harmful to the plant. It does look like only the spikes were coloured. Fake flowers seem a lot worse because they'd lead to scarring. But I guess they're there for the same reason. At the end of the day, its for the $$$. I'm honestly more upset with the fact that the plants are shoved into dark corners for weeks at stores than the paint. Paint (and even fake flowers) they can survive, bad treatment is another story."
succulents,3dx13t,disneyfacts,2,Mon Jul 20 18:09:46 2015 UTC,"The middle 2 are echeverias. The orange/pinks ones might be thumb cacti, but they are painted. You may want to try rinsing them off.  All you have to do is lay them on top of some cacti/succulent soil and they should sprout."

You can place them on top of some soil in a shaded spot and forget about them for a few weeks. That has been my best method for propagation. The ones that I keep an eye on and baby over seem to either never sprout, die quickly, or grow way slower than the ones I keep out in my covered patio and neglect.

succulents,3dv5xp,BackToTheBasic,2,Sun Jul 19 19:58:14 2015 UTC,"You'll want to eventually have it in a spot that gets some nice light, like dabbled sun for most of the day, or a 3-5 hours of direct sun a day.  However, you'll need to acclimate it gradually to that much light over a month or so, as the plant will be very sensitive if it's been sitting in a dark spot and you can sunburn it.  If you live in a place that is hot 90-100 degrees F regularly this time of year you might pick a spot that gets shade during the hottest part of the day.  It should be in well-draining cactus soil and watered whenever the soil starts to dry out, probably 1-2x a week.  It'll take a few months but you should see new growth and it perking up quite a bit."

You just have to make sure the plant is acclimated to the sunlight that it receives.    Check the soil, if it's wet I'd pull the plant out and inspect the roots.  If it smells rotten leave it out of the pot for a few days to dry out.  If roots seem healthy I'd slowly acclimate it to more sunlight and water when dry."

However if it doesn't get enough light it'll stretch and not look appealing.  I'd vote sun 100% of the time.  Just don't take a plant out of your house and put it in the sun full time that's where your brown/dead leaves came from"
succulents,3dqnuc,whats_yours,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:25:15 2015 UTC,"Right. So, how about this:  I move it into DS for 15 minutes more each day, building my way up slowly to the top. Or, what would you advise?  All I can recall is that when I got this Echeveria, I put it into Direct Sunlight straight away but it grew in a store originally so it had no DS and leaves started to die. Once I gave it no DS it got all better and no dead leaves for a long time now.   It's on a South Facing window btw."
succulents,3dqnuc,PM_ME_UR_PLANTS,2,Sat Jul 18 20:41:21 2015 UTC,"You can probably do more like 30-60 min. each day. Otherwise, it'll take you a couple months to make the transition. It'll also depend on your location, though. I can make the change fairly rapidly in the NE US, because the sun isn't super strong and it is often cloudy. You might have to be more careful if you are elsewhere.  The hours near noon are the most dangerous ones, so be more careful with those."
succulents,3dqnuc,whats_yours,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:55:01 2015 UTC,"Summer weather is unusually intense this time so I will keep that in mind, thanks."

succulents,3dqnuc,lmardcarvalho,2,Sat Jul 18 21:22:42 2015 UTC,Could be an interesting experiment if you've got the time
succulents,3dqnuc,silentglaive,2,Sat Jul 18 22:57:30 2015 UTC,I don't know and second the experiment on this one. Two fresh plants (minimum) to have a control and some time. You may be able to try searching around to see if anyone with grant money looked at it more fully.
succulents,3dqnuc,themoleofdoom,2,Sat Jul 18 23:36:44 2015 UTC,"Ok, your 15 mins more each day is a good idea but you can probably get away with more.  I typically go 30 mins to a full hour more each day depending how hot it is outside.  If it's under 80F I'll push more towards the full hour extra time, over 80 and I may even only do the 15 minutes extra.    Your south facing window could also work all year round but it won't flourish as much as it would outside.   *edit: When you're trying to acclimate them to the sun, do your best to either do late afternoon or early morning, midday sun can be extremely intense if you're bringing them outside for an hour or 2 at a time"
succulents,3dsawk,ooorlly,8,Sat Jul 18 23:49:29 2015 UTC,That's a sempervivum. Stick it on top of soil in bright indirect light. It should throw it roots over time.
succulents,3dsawk,breedlovehoops,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:13:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Its potted and in a morning-sun spot. Does it need to be fertilized?   Also, some of the leaves came off when handling it, can I lay these on top of the soil in the same pot? (To propagate)"
succulents,3dsawk,breedlovehoops,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:25:16 2015 UTC,Hold off on the fertilizer and water until you see roots. Sempervivum leaves don't seem to produce pups from what I've seen.

succulents,3drkoq,chuchin_fr,8,Sat Jul 18 19:48:37 2015 UTC,"I would remove the green pups.  Simply cut them off at their little green stems and set them aside somewhere to let the cut ends callous over.  The longer you wait for the ends to dry, the better.  Once you start seeing roots, pot them up in some cactus mix!  Wait a few days before you water. As for the yellowed stem you're holding, cut off any brown rot.  If there's green inside it, set that aside too and see if any babies grow from it."

succulents,3dsl40,m0oncat,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:30:55 2015 UTC,"Gritty mix is the way to go, try to find pumice, turface, perlite, silica sand etc..    You'll want to screen it and aim for 1/8"" to 1/4"" particle size.  Smaller than that and it won't drain as well.  I plan on switching all my succulents to this once my local store has it in stock at about 1/3 of that price.  Less hassle than mixing my own, if it works out that is"
succulents,3dsl40,whats_yours,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:28:55 2015 UTC,"I've seen someone do a mixture of mostly gravel, some perlite and a little bit of soil. Would this work? Or do you suggest just going straight for the purely rocky mixture"
succulents,3dsl40,whats_yours,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:57:50 2015 UTC,"Can work, you have to find out what you like personally.  I bought a small bag of perlite to mix into my potting soil last year and I greatly dislike it.  It helps the soil sure but at the same time it floats to the top of the pot and sticks to your hand when its wet.  I'm switching over to more 'gravel' just for my own tastes"

succulents,3drlf7,nicoleypants,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:53:38 2015 UTC,It is getting etoliated. It is stretching to get more light because it isn't getting enough right now.  Try giving it more light but make sure to change location slowly or it will get sunburn.
succulents,3drz3v,EatsButt,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:57:17 2015 UTC,Why is it growing these stalks (one of which is growing tiny pink roots) into the air?  Is there anything I should do about it? They just keep getting longer and longer.
succulents,3drz3v,panniculus,2,Sat Jul 18 21:58:49 2015 UTC,"Aerial roots. Some people like the look of them once they hit dirt. If you don't, just cut them off."
succulents,3drz3v,persiphone,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:14:02 2015 UTC,Thanks.  Is this a genetic trait of whatever species I have here?  Will all specimens of this species do this?  Or do they only do so under certain conditions?
succulents,3drz3v,persiphone,2,Sat Jul 18 23:53:24 2015 UTC,I know some species make aerial roots more often but I've also heard it means they're looking for more water. How often do you water it? :) edit: oh! and your plant is likely a type of kalanchoe.
succulents,3drz3v,panniculus,2,Sun Jul 19 01:32:16 2015 UTC,I water it (fully saturated) when the soil completely dries out. That usually means every 3-4 days.
succulents,3drz3v,ahbee,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:33:09 2015 UTC,"right :) well your plant looks very happy so it must just be a little.. ""special"" ;)"
succulents,3dsm38,ainswokp,2,Sun Jul 19 01:41:47 2015 UTC,"Yes you should repot them. When you do, try to get unglazed terracotta pots, as they will help suck up excess water. You can get very small pots at Home Depot for 78 cents a pot, which should be the perfect size for your plants I think.  When you water, you want to thoroughly drench them, then let them dry completely out before you water them again.  Don't try to stick to a specific schedule when watering them, just check them every day, as the rate at which the soil drys will change with weather and other circumstances. (For example, in sunny California, I usually stick with once every two or three days, but there is one plant that really likes water every day to every other day.)  They should be fine on light, but you will be able to tell if they want more, look for big spaces between leaves and completely wide open rosettes as a clue for more light, but judging by your pictures, they seem to be quite happy."

succulents,3dp1iv,kallan133,6,Sat Jul 18 09:27:04 2015 UTC,"I recommend searching this subreddit about terrariums specifically and read what users have said about them.  Rocks don't provide drainage, water is still there and has to evaporate to escape the jar leading to a lot of moisture in the environment.  On top of that, are you mixing cacti, succulents, and non succulents together?  That would be very bad because these plants all have different watering, light, and dormancy  requirements.  Remember, succulents live years under good conditions whereas plants in terrariums die within months at the most.  Just some warnings before you proceed."

succulents,3dkucz,nicoleypants,2,Sat Jul 18 03:31:27 2015 UTC,"Looks similar to sedum adolphii, aka Golden Sedum or Firestorm. Looks relatively healthy. The wrinkled leaves indicate its soil is holding too much moisture for too long, or that it has not been watered in a very long time (at least a couple months, perhaps?) If you bought it from a big box store, it's most likely been overwatered."

succulents,3dj5u5,swassie,4,Thu Jul 16 18:18:22 2015 UTC,Innnnteresting. I have a similar effect on a very small Rainbow Elephant Bush. I wonder if it hasn't been potted in cactus soil after all! Perhaps I'll repot it this weekend.
succulents,3dj5u5,derpinaherpette,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:12:03 2015 UTC,is it not good to use rocks on top? I thought putting them around the base of some succulents could help prevent rot from damp soil
succulents,3dj5u5,turtree,3,Thu Jul 16 18:53:50 2015 UTC,I read that they trap moisture in. I think larger rocks are fine though?
succulents,3dj5u5,magnetic_couch,4,Thu Jul 16 18:54:46 2015 UTC,"If you have an unglazed terra cotta pot, it doesn't really matter because the entire pot's surface is water permeable and will wick out moisture. But if you're using a non-permeable pot with just drainage holes, the soil surface needs to be open to air to allow for evaporation. Just need to make sure one way or another that the soil can dry out :)  I have several succulents and cactii (including jade plants) that have similar top dressing that have no problem thanks to terra cotta pots."
succulents,3dj5u5,isfjheartcaffeine,3,Thu Jul 16 21:55:28 2015 UTC,You gotta be careful with topdressings. It all depends on the plant and experience of the gardener. They usually cause more problems but sure do look pretty.
succulents,3dj5u5,madalork,2,Thu Jul 16 20:48:26 2015 UTC,"Sometimes yes, but if you use too many and don't let the soil breathe they will actually block the sunlight from hitting the damp soil, and then it will never dry. In the first picture, there is absolutely no way for that soil to dry with that many rocks on top."
succulents,3dkyyz,Crayshleigh,4,Fri Jul 17 02:55:33 2015 UTC,"While the arrangement looks great, you've mixed a bunch of plants that have very different watering needs. Lithops and the stone plant next to it require very little water and are easy to kill. Trust me, I'm on my second one. Cacti also have different watering needs than succulents, but might be ok in your arrangement. I recommend planting the lithops and stone plant in separate pots."

succulents,3dkyyz,hazelnutty8,2,Fri Jul 17 03:58:29 2015 UTC,"Excellent arrangement! I would keep an eye on the lithops. Every time I've tried to incorporate them into a mix with other succulents they end absorbing too much water and turning into mush. Summer is their dormancy period where they need little to no water, as opposed to most other succulents. You might be able to get around this if you water the succulents and not the lithops - good luck!"

Why is this one drooping? Is it root rot/overwatering? If so, what can I do to fix? Thanks!  Sorry about the sideways photo in the second image, just noticed that!"
succulents,3diyvh,isfjheartcaffeine,2,Thu Jul 16 17:30:40 2015 UTC,Possibly. They might also need more light too. I would cut them and let them grow new roots.
succulents,3diyvh,PM_ME_UR_PLANTS,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:00:39 2015 UTC,"Probably. As the other poster said, you're best off restarting them with more light anyway.  Try to avoid watering X times over X time period. Water them fully and let them dry fully in between. If you have problems with them not being able to dry fast enough to avoid problems, them change to a better draining potting mix."

succulents,3dhgj8,whats_yours,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:58:13 2015 UTC,"It looks pretty healthy overall to me.  The only spot I'd worry about is the tip of that leaf on the left side, looks like sunburn but that's easily fixed.  Just keep it out of direct sunlight and acclimate it to the sunlight over a week or 2.  I've never seen anything like it so I'm not sure the exact light requirements for it.    Goes to show what different angles of pictures will show ya, thought one plant was stretching for light and you've got another with sunburn    Can I ask which direction the window faces that you keep it in?"

succulents,3dhgj8,isfjheartcaffeine,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:53:28 2015 UTC,"I think your #5 is  Gasteria liliputana  or commonly, ox tongue (or a Gasteria at least).  #8 is Crassula, maybe ovata. I have a wiry Crassula like that and I haven't been able to determine if it is ovata. #3 might be Crassula perforata. At some point it will start creeping along the table instead of growing taller. Be careful about having too many rocks on the top layer. The water can't evaporate off the soil and it leaves the soil wet for too long. It ould be why number 8 is wrinkly like that. I agree #4 is a Haworthia. Nice collection :)"
succulents,3dhgj8,emperor000,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:53:15 2015 UTC,Thanks! I got the succulents in those pots with those rocks. How do I know whether they're too many? Should I just remove all of the rocks?
succulents,3dhgj8,drugsarebadmmky,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:51:36 2015 UTC,You don't necessarily need to remove them all. Have enough sparsity so you can see the soil underneath. Like a sprinkling of rocks only or a patch.

Next, research what you want to use on these guys (common remedy on reddit is using neem oil, but you can also use plant soap). If you go to a plant store (or a home depot) you should be able to find either of these.  I recommend researching options prior to buying, just so you become more informed and learn how to best use whatever you buy for the mealy problem.  Best of luck!"
succulents,3dgl4i,thirdtimezsacharm,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:56:32 2015 UTC,Thanks for your help. Is there a specific brand of neem oil I should get or are they all equal. I'm trying not to have a panic attack. I'm hoping I caught this early.
succulents,3dgl4i,thirdtimezsacharm,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:19:13 2015 UTC,"I personally use plant soap, so i'm not sure what brand of neem oil is best (but you can search this subreddit as well as google for different brands and reviews). I'd just go to your local plant store or a big box one (if no local exists, since local stores tend to be more knowledgeable in my experience) and see what they have.   And don't worry, it'll be fine as long as you're diligent."
succulents,3dgl4i,botaglove,2,Thu Jul 16 15:14:15 2015 UTC,"NOT THE MEALIES!!! okay so here's what I did:  took the plants out of their containers   dispose of all soil  clean the containers with hot hot hot water, soap, and rinsed with hydrogen peroxide.   rinse off the succulents with room temp water - make sure you shake the soil off the roots!   dip the succulents in witch hazel for a couple seconds - maybe up to 5 seconds.   allow the succulents to dry completely.   use new soil and replant. wait to water.   PSA: the witch hazel can potentially damage or burn the succulent. HOWEVER: this is the only method i've found that gets the bugs out AND keeps them from returning (so far, its probs been 2 months). i tried using only a q tip with my first bought of these pests to apply the witch hazel, but the damn guys hide, so i dunked them last time.   These bugs love damp environments. from my experience, my plants/soil were too wet for too long when these guys came to visit. make sure your pots have good drainage, water when plants are receiving optimum light, allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings!"

As for care, just spray them with water or soak them every now and don't put them in too intense or direct sunlight and they should be fine. And don't let them stay wet for too long, make sure they get a chance to dry completely before watering them.  Also, try not to water them at night. Unlike most plants that open their stomata during photosynthesis to collect CO2, these open them at night. So covering them in water can apparently inhibit their respiration and ""drown"" them.  Copper is also toxic to them, so be careful with fertilizers with copper."

Misting 2-3 times a week or soaking every 7-10 days for 10 mins at a time should be sufficient indoors during the growing season, less in the winter.  I like to turn mine upside down to dry after I water them, to make sure no moisture gets trapped between the leaves (this can lead to rot very quickly).

succulents,3ddyc3,ChurchOfGWB,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:36:20 2015 UTC,"Yep. Decapitate, give it a day or two to form a callous before you plant it and then put it back in the soil. If you plant it right away there's the risk of it absorbing too much moisture and rotting before it forms roots.   You can keep the stump, too! It may form new leaves after a while."

My snake plant appears to love it there; had him equally as long as the aloe and he's sprouted a pup already! Now if only I could find more plants that would!  I did buy an unglazed terra cotta pot to transfer him to, so hopefully that alone will perk him back up."
succulents,3d9u8p,AllAccessAndy,2,Wed Jul 15 18:56:51 2015 UTC,Sounds like sunlight is not ideal and will be on ongoing issue.  Good luck.
succulents,3d9u8p,geckosean,4,Wed Jul 15 19:45:42 2015 UTC,"As others have said, a container with real drainage is necessary. Ideally unglazed terra cotta will give the fastest drying, but I have an aloe in a more decorative glazed pot with good soil and it does fine as well.  On top of that, I'm not a big fan of miracle gro's cactus soil. It's probably better than standard potting soil, but not by much. Since you already have it you can use it, but I would mix in something to add more drainage like perlite, pumice, coarse sand, etc. so that it doesn't absorb as much water.  Lastly, you're correct about the lack of light. Indoors they really need the brightest window you can possibly find. It would do even better outdoors during the warmer months if that's possible for you. Full sun would be just a little much, but just a little shade during the middle of the day would be perfect."

I wasn't a big fan when I bought the Miracle Gro as I knew I needed something reliably quick draining but I wasn't 100% sure on what alternatives I could use, so I threw my debit card down. I'm disappointed by it's texture - it's so thick, not nearly as airy as I thought it should be.

I've got a new substrate that I picked up from researching bonsai which also need fast draining soil.  I use 100% diatomaceous earth pellets, it needs to be screened as there is usually too many fine particles to be free draining.  It's heavy, won't float, and has a good mix of retaining water and let it drain off.  Can stick to your hands when wet too but easy enough to wipe it off, compared to perlite.    I haven't repotted anything in awhile but I've been meaning to make a mix of the DE and potting soil.  I think it would be best of the options I have.  100% DE has absolutely no nutes in it and plants may be better off with at least some soil.    And to make the post even longer than it already is, I'd be careful with peat moss, if you ever let it dry out its a pain in the ass to rewet, water will just sit on it and not penetrate  Edit: Diatomaceous Earth can probably find something similar if there isn't a napa near you"

succulents,3dasry,whats_yours,2,Tue Jul 14 22:00:58 2015 UTC,"Yea the top leaves in in the last pictures, they appear to be drooping to me."

succulents,3d8yz2,eda1013,2,Tue Jul 14 12:57:09 2015 UTC,I have a few thanksgiving cacti (which are often mistakenly called Christmas cacti) which are a close relative. A change in lighting and temperature usually help to trigger flowering. I keep mine outside all summer on a shaded patio and let them stay out there until the temperatures dip down to about 50F at night for a couple weeks and then bring them indoors. They usually start budding within a couple weeks.
succulents,3d8yz2,AllAccessAndy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:57:48 2015 UTC,How much heat can it stand?
succulents,3d8yz2,AllAccessAndy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:30:32 2015 UTC,"As long as they're kept from drying out and kept out of the sun, they shouldn't be bothered by the heat much. Our summers occasionally break 100, but our highs are generally in the low 90s for the hottest few weeks of the year."
succulents,3d8yz2,AllAccessAndy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:34:38 2015 UTC,I want to repot it is cactus soil the best. That's what I have for my others
succulents,3d8yz2,emperor000,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:40:29 2015 UTC,"They don't like to dry out as much between waterings as most cacti. Mine are in a mix of about half normal potting soil and half Miracle gro orchid potting mix. The Miracle gro stuff really isn't great for actual orchids, but I think it works pretty well for epiphytic cacti."

succulents,3d98fd,_martin_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:19:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, but it won't be the proper ratio if the succulent fertilizers I have seen have the proper ratio. You'll have too much nitrogen, which can be bad. So you'll want to be sure to flush any excess from the soil and not let it build up.  Or just get a succulent fertilizer.  You can feed any plant with any ratio. The issues comes with flushing out the excess salts left over from an improper ratio or the dosage just being too high."
succulents,3d98fd,emperor000,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:52:17 2015 UTC,"Oh thanks. I heard that a suitable fertiliser for succulents is one a nitrogen reading under 6, and generally no figure over 12(?) so I thought this might work. It's bonsai fertiliser."
succulents,3d98fd,emperor000,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:08:51 2015 UTC,"Most succulent fertilizers I have seen have a ratio of 2:7:7, but I haven't really been able to find how they arrived at that other than knowing that most succulents like low nitrogen."

And not just anybody, people who grew from seed were obsessed with this plant.  I know people who special order seeds from private collections in Thailand just to get special colors.

succulents,3d44e4,madalork,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:14:37 2015 UTC,"Possibly, I try not to in general but it might be that I overwatered it when repotting.  When repotting/propagating should you still keep it pretty dry? I always have it in my head that they need more regular watering at that stage but that's probably totally wrong"
succulents,3d44e4,whats_yours,2,Mon Jul 13 15:35:11 2015 UTC,"You can water propagating leaves about once or twice a month. They don't need more than that. Once they have a decent root system, you should plant them in soil, and once they establish themselves (tug on them slightly and see if the plant is 'holding' itself in the dirt), you can begin to water them as you would your other succulents, which would be heavily, then not again until the soil is completely dry."

succulents,3d09h6,Rexingtonboss,4,Sun Jul 12 12:30:48 2015 UTC,Greenhouses are excellent for succulents; you just have to maintain the environment for what's necessary like any other greenhouse.  I'm actually saving up to build a small one for my property.
succulents,3d09h6,kallan133,2,Sun Jul 12 15:09:41 2015 UTC,I've seen succulent collections in greenhouses. They just can't stay moist for long durations. Make sure it's not super humid like the top person said.

Mike looked like this before they started rotting from the bottom up. If I were you, I would take them out of the pot, let the dirt dry for a few days, and then replant in a gritty well draining soil in a larger pot."
succulents,3d3vz3,christ9000,3,Mon Jul 13 08:56:26 2015 UTC,"It is not getting enough light, it needs to be outside for the summer time and taken inside during temperatures below 50F.  The direction of the window is important as useable light for a plant is reduced dramatically by a window, even when they are next to it. A southern or next best western window is best, succulents love sunlight light so try to give them as much as possible when you can.  For watering just stick your finger in the soil and see if it's dried out a few inches down. So rain isn't bad unless it rains for two days straight and then just put a piece of fabric or similar over your plant to allow the soil to dry out. If you want to not worry about watering then you can slip pot them into fast draining soil, there are plenty of pre made mixes out there.  In the sidebar there is a list of grow tips, use that as a checklist to see if you are providing everything they need :)"

Do not water them until their soil is completely dry for two whole days. They will not die. They like it. Then you water them thouroughky , until water comes out of the drainage hole. If you have no drainage holes, then I'd say it's root rot. As for propagations take off a nice leaf, keep it outside with the leaf facing up with the soil watered just as much as your other plants. They all need sun. They all need to be outdoors. Your propagations will take time to grow. Some leaves will shrivel. It takes about two weeks.

succulents,3cuq5d,SolarBears,2,Sat Jul 11 01:13:48 2015 UTC,Cut back the long whip when you get buds on the damaged ones. That's the quickest way to give you a new canopy.
succulents,3cuq5d,kallan133,2,Sat Jul 11 07:58:13 2015 UTC,Thank goodness the squirrels leave my collection alone. I have a bird feeder nearby that they pick up fallen seed from. It is the Yankee feeder so they can't actually sit on it and eat the feed. Good thing about succulents is that they're hardy!
succulents,3cuq5d,SolarBears,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:48:13 2015 UTC,"I think someone feeds the squirrels walnuts in my area.  Walnut trees are rare here (can grow just fine just aren't), but I keep finding walnut shells all over the yard.  The squirrels don't mess with my collection or herbs, though.  Thank goodness for us?"
succulents,3cuq5d,JaseKian,2,Sat Jul 11 14:57:03 2015 UTC,I think there is a theme here. OP maybe try feeding the little heathens?

succulents,3cuq5d,graffiti81,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:49:21 2015 UTC,"I always think of squirrels as adorable curious furry friends, but when I see this not so much :/.... Make a spray of chili flakes/oil/black peppercorns they hate that stuff- and grow some peppermint plants too."
succulents,3cuq5d,graffiti81,2,Sat Jul 11 01:30:21 2015 UTC,"If peppermint actually works, and the grower has an aversion to mint (as I do, cause it's so invasive) Pelargonium graveolens variegata is a good substitute. Just needs to have some epsom salt once in a while, and it'll produce tons of peppermint scented leaves, and it's actually the exact same chemical.  EDIT: Upon further research, you'd have to make sure to get a peppermint one. Apparently there's several cultivars that have different scents. TIL."

succulents,3cstfz,silchi,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:00:15 2015 UTC,"Incredibly easy in my experience with several caudiciforms. The biggest pitfall with them typically is how absolutely easy you can rot them. This one is very difficult to rot, however, what will instead happen is it will defoliate completely when under/over watered and when repotted. A quick, thorough warm drink after letting it dry out will wake it back up right away. They need to be let go dormant in winter to preserve good growth habits.  If you grow it in gritty mix, as I have switched to this year, it seems impossible to overwater it in the warmer months. I drench mine almost every other day."

succulents,3cstfz,macroblue,2,Sat Jul 11 03:41:40 2015 UTC,"Gritty mix, drinks every other day when its warm and sunny (its been in the upper 90s most of the month here, so drinks frequently) and I have been adding fertilizer at least weekly, sometimes twice weekly. It is diluted (keep it about half strength for regular fertilzings) miracle gro which isn't all that great but its better than nothing. With the other waterings I use a enzymatically digested kelp fertilizer I got from home depot, and sometimes fish/guano liquid fertilizer. A regular half or so strength fertilizer of your choice would probably be fine if it is balanced, allowing you do apply it more frequently, and the gritty mix is also crucial to allow for more frequent fertilzings. Full sun.  Thats about it. Big deep pots (mine is not in a deep one yet, sadly) and terracotta definitely."
succulents,3cv21z,exit_music04,5,Sat Jul 11 00:34:16 2015 UTC,"It's a foam. You are supposed to squirt it onto the soil, and water as normal. If you get it on the plant, you are supposed to rinse it off the plant, but still just water as normal. The nutrient ratio is .5-1-1.  I'm also interested in what others here think of this product, as I bought some, but have yet to use it."
succulents,3cv21z,Nakagator,6,Sat Jul 11 02:54:40 2015 UTC,"I use something similar called osmocote that you put in the soil and it gets released by waterings, my grandmother swore by it and my plants do seem to love it. Never used this one though."
succulents,3cv21z,madalork,4,Sat Jul 11 03:39:41 2015 UTC,I've used it but it's kind of a pain cause the foam floats. You can let it dissolve and then water though.
succulents,3cv21z,epicrobotbattle,2,Sat Jul 11 03:23:10 2015 UTC,"Depends on the Nitrogen level. For slow growing succulents, it's best to use a balanced fertiliser, low in Ni, as it promotes rapid growth which obviously isn't desirable with most succulents. I normally just use half strength tomato fertiliser; and it's worked fine so far."
succulents,3cv21z,theninjanipples,2,Sat Jul 11 08:48:50 2015 UTC,"I just used that on my succulents and cacti yesterday. For what it's worth, the reviews on Amazon rave about it. We'll see what happens!"

I just look up plants specifically, no need for a cliff's notes on particular plant varieties.    If your plants are burning up in the sun, it sounds like you're attempting to put them into full blazing sun all day long and leave them there.  You have to acclimate them to the sun, about an hour at a time each day, slowly increasing day by day.    Since they're already burned, you'll need to keep them out of direct sunlight entirely for a good week or so and they should recover.    If you're unsure on ID's for the 2nd plant, try posting a picture, I'm sure someone can lead you down the right path."

I wouldn't do it unless you absolutely had to, but healthy plants that were kept very dry might survive it."
succulents,3cwnmg,AllAccessAndy,3,Sat Jul 11 14:14:34 2015 UTC,They would suffer a bit but most should survive. Depending on the size of your collection It might be worth investing in some stackable milk crates. I packed all my plants in them in their pots. That way I could still water all the plants and put them outside when possible to get some sun. If you do stack them during transport just make sure they're properly secured and you should get everything to your new home in one happy piece.

People assume that when it rains, (it rains often here) that it's going to over water them, but they all have drainage systems, and all have fast draining soil.

succulents,3ctkjh,mellymarie1123,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:38:48 2015 UTC,If it still has roots then you don't need to cut it yet. If you have repotted it and the roots were firm not mushy then it should be okay. Make sure it is in a well draining soil and water carefully for the next few weeks. As long as it doesn't continue to sit in wet soil it should recover quickly. :)

succulents,3csvbg,GhettoGopher,2,Sat Jul 11 01:14:52 2015 UTC,I've found a few pretty uncommon cacti there in the really small $2.49 trays. It's the only place locally I've seen Tephrocactus or Astrophytum.  They really are kept terribly in the store though. They're almost always crammed together on a dark little shelf and either soaking wet or never watered at all.

succulents,3csdaz,Chtulhu_Cult,3,Fri Jul 10 11:30:25 2015 UTC,"What plants are we talking about here?    If they require full sunlight, there's no reason why they shouldn't be on your front porch for 5-6 hours of sunlight.  If a plant requires bright indirect light/light shade, keep them out of direct sunlight, filtered sunlight through a tree canopy or shade cloth are examples of indirect/filtered light."
succulents,3csdaz,whats_yours,2,Fri Jul 10 12:47:43 2015 UTC,"Not much difference. Full sun could mean that it gets direct sun for the full day.  What are the plants? Most succulents are going to do fine in direct sunlight once they are acclimated.   I'm thinking placing them on the front porch to get a good 5-6 hours under the sun wouldn't be a wise idea   Why not? These are succulents, right? Most plants need about that much sunlight. Succulents generally like as much sun as they can get, with some exceptions."
succulents,3csdaz,emperor000,2,Fri Jul 10 13:18:50 2015 UTC,"Porch sounds fine for full sun plants, just acclimate them to it if they've been growing in a shadier area.  A lot of succulents can handle a range of light, and will just adjust their shape/color accordingly.  With more sun, plants appreciate more water as the soil dries out faster, especially at first as the roots are getting established to a new container.  You can always just try something and watch over a month how they respond."

How often are you watering it?  I would personally take it out of that soil and check out the roots, make sure its not rotting, then place it into something more gritty. Most of those standard cactus soils are so so difficult to understand, and from the more experienced growers I've spoken to they wont touch that stuff because it will likely lead to rot."
succulents,3cqeuo,Pushrestart,2,Fri Jul 10 01:10:37 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to grow it indoors. I placed it outside for about a week (dumb move on my part), because I thought ""Hey, maybe its leaves are falling off cause it's not getting enough light."" I'm not sure if light was the issue, but a bug nibbled its leaves so I took it back inside. It is in my bathroom (large bathroom, so I don't think humidity is an issue) in a NE facing window. This window seemed to be the brightest in my house. The window has ""block style"" glass (not sure what it's called, but it prevents people from seeing inside).  I watered it only once when I potted it, which was a month ago. I heard succulents don't need much water at all, so I haven't watered it since. I've had the plant for a month.   I am afraid it's the soil. What would you recommend for something more gritty? Should I mix the cactus soil with gravel or sand?

I think the NE window is a big problem, definitely not enough light. South or West would be a better option. I dont know how invested you are in succulents or if you plan to pick up more plants, but a gritty mix isnt really sold in stores so you have to source a number of items like turface, pumice, decomposed granite etc etc....  An easier option for now would be to get pumice and mix it 3:1 cactus mix.

succulents,3cqeuo,GodSpeedToYou,3,Fri Jul 10 23:59:57 2015 UTC,"You may have sunburned it by throwing it outside after having it indoors all the time.  It should be getting some direct sun, but you need to acclimate it to light gradually.  You should probably be watering more.  I water my plants as soon as the soil dries out.  That might be once a week or more.  The plants probably need some UV, they might not get much through thick glass blocks.  The UV may also help prevent fungal damage on the leaves."

I tried putting it outside for a while because I was concerned it wasn't getting enough light, but the problem didn't stop and something nibbled its leaves, so I brought it back in.   This is my first succulent, and I love the way they look, but I'm scared I am doing something wrong!"
succulents,3cqeuo,BackToTheBasic,2,Thu Jul 9 23:08:29 2015 UTC,I water my succulents whenever the soil is dry (about every 3-4 days depending on sun and drainage). NE is pretty low light. South or west would be better. Placing your plant in direct sun outside could have been a shock for it and caused some leaf drop. If you can't find a better window at least water the poor guy.

I would recommend replanting it into some soil with more perlite or some other medium to increase drainage.

succulents,3consn,harry_manbacks,2,Thu Jul 9 15:18:14 2015 UTC,"In what way were you watering them on a daily basis? We're you also leaving them out in these rainstorms? I don't think plants like these should need that much watering if you're doing it properly. A heavy watering at the root level of the plant should be good, and not needed again until the soil dries out again. If it's hot enough to need that much water, you might want to move them to a spot with less intense sunlight, this could be sunburn as the marks only appear to be on the top-level leaves of your plant. If it's not a burn, I would be checking for rot due to overwatering. Some more care-details could assist in a diagnosis."
succulents,3consn,madalork,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:27:16 2015 UTC,"My SO was caring for them before I arrived (he got here a few weeks before me). I think he may have been over watering them in an attempt to make sure they were watered. I don't really water them that much normally. I have since brought them indoors and stopped watering for the past few days. The pot still appears damp because of all the water in spite of not watering in a few days. They were left out in the rain (we're talking multiple days of heavy rain). The sickly leaves are falling off.  They were also in full sun.  If it is root rot, how would I be able to tell and what are the steps to get rid of it? Thanks for your response."
succulents,3consn,madalork,2,Thu Jul 9 15:33:09 2015 UTC,"I want to go with root rot by what you're saying, as these plants do not need much water as you said. First things first, you should remove any of these damaged leaves from the plant, as they are only putting a higher strain on the plant overall by trying to heal themselves, and they won't come back from it. If you remove the plants from the soil as if to transplant them and look at the roots, you should see mushy roots, mold, or be able to smell a not-so-pleasant smell if there is root rot present. I've been able to save plants from this by removing bad roots and any wet soil as well as any damaged leaves or portions of the plant, and replanting the plant in some dry soil for a few days to recover. Once you start to see the plant coming back healthy again, go ahead and give it a good dose of water and continue with regular watering.   If you think the roots are beyond repair, you have enough plant here to get some trimmings and start propagating for sure, so I think you're okay either way!"

succulents,3clx59,dessa17,12,Wed Jul 8 22:52:59 2015 UTC,"Cut above the rot. Leave the cut top to callous and then place on a decent soil. It has a decent chance to survive.  Give the root and stump no water for several weeks, it might even survive that rot."
succulents,3clx59,DarklyNoon,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:37:13 2015 UTC,Thank you for your help!!
succulents,3clx59,DarklyNoon,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:15:35 2015 UTC,So after it callous's just place it on top of the soil? Or should I stick it in at all?
succulents,3clx59,shillyshally,3,Thu Jul 9 01:21:56 2015 UTC,I would probably just place it and let it works its roots in.
succulents,3clx59,AllAccessAndy,2,Thu Jul 9 01:28:18 2015 UTC,"Use a very light mix - I use approximately half potting soil and half -or more - fine vermiculite.  You can shove it in a teeny bit. Being outside would help as well, good light but not direct sun for now and do not water for maybe a month and then sparingly.  As with any potted plant, it is best to give it a good soak, not sprinkle water on the top of the soil. This does not foster deep root growth. The roots will stay close to the surface and easily burn out.  Edit - make sure there are no mealy bugs infesting it. White, cottony masses in the roots.  If the soil is pulling away from the inner edge of the pot, the plant is not being watered properly."
succulents,3clx59,graffiti81,4,Thu Jul 9 13:30:06 2015 UTC,"Some, but not much. Get a sharp knife and cut above the rot. Let the cut edge of the top dry for several days until it has fully calloused and then plant it in some cactus soil. Keep it pretty dry until it starts to grow. Hopefully the top portion is large enough that it doesn't just dry up completely.   On a related note, I have this exact species that my dog knocked over and partially broke and it's currently rotting in a similar fashion."

succulents,3clx59,graffiti81,3,Thu Jul 9 01:15:59 2015 UTC,"I've never seen an Altman Oreocereus celsianus in the wild. I knew they grew them, but the Lowes near me never has them.  I have several Altman cacti (if you don't know what I'm talking about Altman Nurseries, or at least a subsidiary, supplies Lowes and Walmart at least with cacti) and they're all doing well.  As others have said, cutting and callousing and hoping for reroot is your best course here.   However, for future reference, here's how I handle these plants. First of all, I let them dry completely. The peat moss will shrink up and the whole root ball should essentially fall out of the pot. Then I take a little stick, like a kebab stick, and start teasing out chunks of peat moss, vermiculite and sticks that they use as growing medium. It takes some time, but you will eventually end up with bare root. Then plant it in some mostly-mineral (coarse sand, pebbles, Turface/fired DE speedy-dry, and a small amount of compost) and let it sit for a week with NO water. Then water and enjoy.  Honestly, I've been nothing but happy with Altman cacti. Sure, they're pushed to get them to market, but they all do well for me."
succulents,3clx59,acrystalmoon,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:41:29 2015 UTC,Cacti should never be in peat moss.  Are those being sold with peat?
succulents,3clx59,graffiti81,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:45:44 2015 UTC,"That's how pretty much all commercially grown cacti are started and grown for their first few years. Pure potting soil. When my parents ran greenhouses we called it Pro Mix.   There's basically two ways to grow cacti from seed: Either by matching native conditions as closely as possible (like Mesa Gardens) or growing as fast as possible with lots of water, heat, and fertilizer. Altman goes for the latter. They're a commercial grower and they need to have product ready when the stores are ready. Can't really blame them."
succulents,3clx59,emperor000,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:56:24 2015 UTC,"Potting soil is one thing, and risky enough for cacti and other succulents in and of itself. Peat moss is another."

succulents,3clx59,emperor000,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:18:45 2015 UTC,Potting soil is not pure peat moss...
succulents,3clx59,graffiti81,2,Thu Jul 9 13:16:03 2015 UTC,It's better than 90% peat moss by volume. Close enough for me.
succulents,3clx59,emperor000,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:18:10 2015 UTC,"Peat moss that you buy by itself is only partially composted. As far as I know/can tell, potting soil is more composted than ""pure peat moss"". That's why it tends to have the smaller particles and be darker.  Peat moss might be the organic material in potting soil, but my point is that if you buy a peat moss bale it is usually going to be a rich brown color, unlike potting soil which is almost always much darker/grayer in color."
succulents,3clx59,emperor000,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:38:40 2015 UTC,"Regardless of any of that, potting soil sucks just as bad as peat moss at rewetting when dry. Which is the biggest reason you don't use it."

succulents,3cmnsz,kryptonitewhale,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:43:32 2015 UTC,How much is over watering? How much should she water monthly?
succulents,3cmnsz,LadyTarTar,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:57:30 2015 UTC,I would completely saturate the soil every 10 days or so. More often if the air is hot and dry and less often if it's cool and humid. Most plants go dormant for a few months and the season depends on the species- during that time (usually winter) I would only water once a month.
succulents,3cmnsz,kryptonitewhale,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:26:33 2015 UTC,"There's no such thing as a certain amount of water to give a plant in a certain period of time. You need to know how to tell when your plant needs more water and then water it. Sticking to a schedule is how plants get over or under watered.  In this case, this is a species of Euphorbia that will need to dry out between waterings. When it's actively growing, little leaves will form at the growth points. During this period it will use a lot more water and could be watered up to several times per week if it's drying out. In the winter with less light and cooler temperatures, it will likely go dormant and lose its leaves. At this stage, it probably won't need water more than once a month."
succulents,3cn1za,indigomontolla,2,Thu Jul 9 04:30:57 2015 UTC,Your sedum looks very etiolated - it is struggling upwards to find light. Place it in a position where it receives full sunlight.

succulents,3ciie2,bmb222,5,Wed Jul 8 04:21:15 2015 UTC,"Just stopping by to present an image that will make most of you question everything you know about succulents. That reservoir at the bottom is continuously filled and most of the medium is always damp, 24/7.  Everything I've read seems to confirm that with this method there is far less risk of root rot vs. careful watering with standard potting methods, surprisingly. I'll let you guys know how it progresses, but one thing I can report is a Pachypodium saundersii that has been dormant for about 2 weeks after unpacking it from shipping woke up within 2 days of transplant to S/H. Everything else is growing at a reasonably fast rate whereas they normally go dormant for ~2 weeks after a transplanting, especially since I had to remove all the soil from the roots which succulents HATE"

They say you should use a clean, sterilized knife or scissors to make the cut, but I use my Swiss Army Knife and haven't encountered any problems. Then I place them in soil and treat them like a fully-grown plant, watering when leaves get wrinkly. I find that, probably since they don't have root systems, cuttings need water more often than plants."

I am also going to try keeping them out of direct sun until they're established because I think I ended up scorching my last set... They had gotten very dark brown and shriveled, but I had them in full sun and outside where it rains often (Florida) so that probably didn't help either.   At least now my plants are out of direct sun and are under cover where they won't get drowned in rain.   Thanks for the tips!"

succulents,3ci92s,_Calochortus_,3,Wed Jul 8 03:35:10 2015 UTC,"I would ignore what /u/reParaoh says.  It's got roots. It can be watered. But don't stick it in soil/dirt. Put it on top and let those roots grow into the soil. They will need water to do that. Let it dry out like they said, but it has roots that will need water."
succulents,3ci92s,emperor000,2,Wed Jul 8 14:01:29 2015 UTC,"Yep, this is the correct answer. I'd give it just a dribble of water, because those roots aren't mature enough to soak up much right now.

succulents,3ci92s,mieeel,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:22:13 2015 UTC,"Okay so its already in dirt, I'd just unearth it and leave it on top and give it some water? Also should the dirt stay damp since I'm trying to grow out the roots?"
succulents,3ci92s,emperor000,2,Wed Jul 8 18:44:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'd take it out and just lay it on top. It's probably safer to let the dirt dry out between watering it, but it doesn't matter so much. The roots aren't likely to drown/rot if they are above the soil in the air."

Are you are sure you aren't overwatering (making sure it is completely dry before watering)?  Otherwise you may have a fungus, bacterial infection, virus, or maybe mites.  Personally I wouldn't use a medium as wood heavy as that. Wood would form a great food source for a fungal colony.  Maybe try treating with a miticide or fungicide.  Best bet IMHO would be to take cuttings from the healthiest portions and after callousing, pot in a soil comprised mostly of perlite and topsoil.  Edit: looked up stonecrop, is a sedum. Bet it is an infection of some sort as they are tough plants that love full sun. Wouldn't use bark/wood to plant it in myself. 50/50 topsoil and perlite with a dash of coarse sand and vermiculate work well for me.  Propagate the healthy portions. Maybe treat with a pesticide to rule out some sort of mite or nematode."

Store-bought succulent mix combined 50/50 with perlite, pumice, fine gravel, coarse sand, or a mixture thereof works well for most succulents. Place in bright, but not direct, sunlight. When moving to a brighter area, acclimate them gradually. Place them in the new spot for a hour more each day to avoid sunburn. Water when the plants' leaves are soft when pinched.

succulents,3cf7yl,turtree,3,Tue Jul 7 13:16:57 2015 UTC,"My elephant bush isn't looking very bushy these days. It's very flat and dropping tons of leaves, both old and new growth. It was doing pretty well and growing very quickly, so I transferred it to a larger pot. This is where I messed up. The container was plastic and too large and it seemed like the soil never dried out. While it was in this container the leaves started dropping like crazy. A few weeks ago I moved it to this smaller, clay pot and have watered it once since the move besides daily misting. It's continued to grow new leaves but it's still dropping tons of leaves, as well as some of the leaves looking mangled like you can see in the photos. Besides keeping the soil dry, is there anything else I can do to make it less flat and more bushy? I know lots of people have portulacaria bonsai but mine looks like the opposite of that. :/  As far as propagating, can I take some of the healthy leaves it's dropping and set them aside to grow roots or is there a different way? How would I go about doing that?  Thanks so much!"
succulents,3cf7yl,madalork,2,Tue Jul 7 13:24:32 2015 UTC,"I would say that if you repotted it, it may just be losing leaves naturally to get some energy to build up new roots in the new container, in which case keep calm and carry on! How much sun/water are you giving it on a daily basis? It should definitely prefer the new pot to the plastic one.  I've never propagated one from the leaves, but you can certainly propagate from the stem. Just cut a portion off at a joint, and then remove the bottom leaves from the stem and insert it into the soil after allowing ample time to heal. Leave some leaves out too as an experiment!"

succulents,3cf7yl,madalork,4,Tue Jul 7 13:45:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think misting the leaves every morning is good for your plant. Instead of misting the leaves, water the soil heavily once a week, and let the soil dry out before watering again.   One way to make it bushy is to ""pinch and prune"" the new growth. But wait on that for a little bit till your plant's roots become more established in the new pot."
succulents,3cf7yl,madalork,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:04:02 2015 UTC,"Yes I should have added this to my response. I'm not sure the plant likes being misted on the leaves every morning. Definitely focus the watering on the soil, and do it heavily allowing for ample time to dry out between waterings. I've been told not to water on cloudy days either, which I have done for some time with success."
succulents,3cf7yl,madalork,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:06:20 2015 UTC,"Some of the leaves in the first picture even look slightly shriveled, I would maybe consider doing a heavier watering on the lower-portion of the plant so the roots get some moisture, then wait until the soil is completely dry before doing it again, this plant shouldn't need too much water to maintain it's health, and it certainly is getting enough light. If the leaves appear to be burning at any point, I would consider cutting down on the amount of full sunlight it gets throughout the day. Keep a close eye on it for sure, but only time will tell. I'm growing one of these at the moment as well, and when I had problems with it it ended up being a lack of water, and lack of sunlight issue. After that was resolved, the leaves started coming back and the stems started growing rapidly again. It's a great plant that can get very big in the right environment!"
succulents,3cf7yl,pinkfairyprincess,2,Tue Jul 7 13:54:22 2015 UTC,Will it start growing upwards with more growth or should I tie it to supports to make to more upright? It seems to be growing horizontally as opposed to vertically
succulents,3cgjgp,notabean,2,Tue Jul 7 19:06:10 2015 UTC,"Sunburn definitely on the jade, you have to slowly adjust them to sunlight if you're changing where they were.  Start off just for an hour or 2 for a couple days, slowly increasing until they can be left in full sun most of the day.  Takes about a week or 2 depending on weather. For now leave it in the shade for at least a week, no direct sunlight.  They'll bounce back although you may need to trim the burned leaves off eventually."

succulents,3cff50,_martin_,3,Tue Jul 7 14:19:43 2015 UTC,Sand is okay for succulents sometimes. I usually mix some of it in with the rest of my soil since it provides some extra drainage.
succulents,3cff50,madalork,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:27:51 2015 UTC,"True, but this is salty beach sand. There must be maybe half a teaspoon or so in each pot, I'm guessing but definitely no more than a teaspoon. The issue is that it's salty and I don't know how good that is. I know using washed sand is good and even better ground rock powder but I'm worried about the salt.  EDIT: Do you use beach sand?"
succulents,3cff50,madalork,2,Tue Jul 7 14:39:56 2015 UTC,"Oh I see what you mean now, I didn't make that connection initially. I would agree that the ground rock power and gravel are better for the plants, so it might be best to just remove the beach sand entirely to avoid the problem. The ground rocks should give the same appearance as the sand anyway. I think some plants can thrive in sand, but many also won't sadly."

succulents,3cff50,c0ncept,2,Wed Jul 8 14:03:39 2015 UTC,"I often mix a good amount of regular ""play sand"" used in sandboxes into my soil. Cheap and definitely allows water to drain quickly.

succulents,3cff50,emperor000,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:22:48 2015 UTC,What kind of soil? Sand mixed with potting soil is a pretty bad idea.
succulents,3cff50,c0ncept,2,Wed Jul 8 14:03:10 2015 UTC,"Usually sand + succulent/cactus soil. I've mixed sand and regular potting soil before, didn't really notice any problems with my plants from doing that though."
succulents,3cff50,thecakeisnotalie,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:28:55 2015 UTC,"It would depend on the plant. But it is going to create a dense soil mixture. Sand is denser than the soil and air and water. It breaks up the soil into smaller particles that removes the spaces that should be taken up by water when the soil is moist and air when the soil is dry.  Leave a plant in it long enough and you should see what I mean. It's not necessarily going to kill it, but it's not really improving aeration or drainage either."

I got some coral sand from a tropical beach and it was mostly used as a topping. One teaspoon of sand, even with the salt is not going to harm your plants much and if you are worried, you can flush the pot with water.    When I do use beach sand, I would normally rinse it a few times to get the dirt and other bits of algae etc out. Then I will leave it to soak for a week, changing the water every few days. After that it is ready to use in potting mixes."
succulents,3cefse,kaduong,39,Tue Jul 7 07:16:28 2015 UTC,Succulents don't do well in terrariums. They get poor airflow and no drainage then they rot.  Succulents like dry conditions and then heavy watering and then completely drying again.   Most have very poor tolerance for salts in the soil. When they are watered then salts are left behind. Heavy watering with drainage in the pot allows the salts to be flushed away.  Terrariums are about the worst environment for succulents possible. Makes for a pretty picture on Pintrest and dead plants in a few months.  Succulents need drainage.
succulents,3cefse,DarklyNoon,3,Tue Jul 7 08:53:10 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info. I went on YouTube to see how to make succulent terrariums. The video makers should  have also noted your plants will die in a few months.

succulents,3cda23,acrystalmoon,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:49:01 2015 UTC,They're extremely slow growing and mostly have a long taproot. I already have a tall terra cotta container that would hold one of these for probably over a decade. A large clay drain pipe will also probably work if one of these does really well.

succulents,3ccwts,Goliath_Gamer,8,Mon Jul 6 22:53:22 2015 UTC,"If you want the plants to survive, you need to remove them from those terrariums. The lack of drainage, airflow, and salt build up will kill them. They will rot.  Need to be in a pot with drainage, preferably terracotta. Also properly draining soil like 50/50 topsoil and perlite. Moss will just hold in the humidity, and that is not good.  They make for a pretty Pintrest picture like this but will only last a few months."

succulents,3ccwts,emperor000,5,Tue Jul 7 12:34:49 2015 UTC,"Now that you have pictures, you should just take the plants out so they can grow properly and survive.  Those terrariums are overcrowded, which probably won't be a problem since most of the plants probably won't survive anyway."
succulents,3ccwts,kallan133,3,Tue Jul 7 12:44:42 2015 UTC,"As everyone has pointed out, terrariums are extremely difficult for maintaining succulents in.  They don't provide enough space for root growth and retain for too much humidity.  They're very pretty but die within months.  Succulents, under normal conditions, live for years.

succulents,3ccwts,turtree,6,Tue Jul 7 06:50:42 2015 UTC,"They can easily die in a terrarium because succulents aren't terrarium plants, they prefer open air to dry out their roots completely before heavy watering again. They would do much better in a clay or terricota pot with some high drainage soil.

I can't tell you what they all are but this one looks like Portulacaria afra    And I assume this is the one on the verge of dying? I had a Black Prince echeveria look the same way and within a month it was gone.  Make sure its drying out between waterings  As far as propagating, I've never had any luck with echeveria's at all, I just can't get the leaves to root ever.  Your Portulacaria is easily rooted with stem cuttings, I've tried with leaves off of them but they shrivel up long before any growth.  I did see a jade in there somewhere too, I've had success just pulling a leaf off the mother and leaving it on top of soil for a few weeks.  Just make sure your cuttings/leaflets don't get too much light or they will dry up before rooting.  Mist everyday/every other depending how fast they dry up.  Don't leave them in soaking soil and don't leave it dry as a bone.  All too often I'm too quick to water a leaflet that just starting rooting and it rots away.  Good luck you've got plenty of stock to try your hands at just don't do it all at once lol"
succulents,3c8co4,Journal-Junkie,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:21:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the one you linked is the one that died. Those pictures are all a month old, and that's the day after I bought it. The string bean one is INSANE with how much its grown, it's practically eating the pot. I'm splitting the last of those succulents up into different pots, because I'm afraid they might be fighting over root space or something. :/"
succulents,3c8co4,kallan133,2,Mon Jul 6 12:53:08 2015 UTC,"Never give up.  So many factors come into play with propagation.  And, as I've said before, a lot of the time you have to experiment for what works for you.  Most people will say to lightly mist or never mist.  But, for me, I freaking soak my pot and then just wait a couple days before repeating.  This goes against every tutorial I've ever read, but it works well for me.  Also, never give up on a leaf until it is black, and withered.  I had a leaf cutting I found on the floor of Home Depot that hadn't done anything for a year.  No joke, it has just sat there for a year.  As of about a week ago, it started sprouting roots and shoots.    Good luck and don't stop trying"
succulents,3c8co4,Journal-Junkie,2,Mon Jul 6 10:30:07 2015 UTC,"When you soak the pot, so you actually dunk a terra cotta pot in water and let it absorb, or do you mean you just water heavily until it runs out the bottom?  I'm trying to propagate now and I'm misting, but I'm scared to get the leaves wet... should it be only the soil that's wet or is it ok if the leaves are, too?  I had no idea a leaf could be dormant for that long and still grow! Gives me hope, thanks :)"
succulents,3c8co4,Chtulhu_Cult,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:02:28 2015 UTC,The pot is shallow and plastic with no bottom drainage so water sits for awhile.  I try to add water around the leaves but haven't cared too much if some water gets on the leaves.  I water until I see a little bit of water run when I tilt it.  Be very careful with this method as it can lead to rotting in many climates.

succulents,3c77u8,Sandwichamacallit,4,Sun Jul 5 15:01:51 2015 UTC,"Most cactus/succulents have a dormancy period where they don't need watering for a few months. (There's summer or winter dormancy periods) My guess is that you watered during the dormancy period which caused it to rot away like that.   Question: If you kept your plant inside, why did you hold off watering due to the rain? Just curious."
succulents,3c77u8,isfjheartcaffeine,2,Sun Jul 5 15:34:09 2015 UTC,"Are there any clues to when a plant is dormant, it's growing?  I don't remember if I read it somewhere or if I made it up. But if it's raining, it's cloudy, so the plants aren't getting a lot of sun to dry out the top of the soil. In theory that reduces the risk of mold and rot. Also the humidity plays a larger roll in my other house plants."
succulents,3c77u8,isfjheartcaffeine,2,Sun Jul 5 16:33:40 2015 UTC,"Ok, I can see that making sense.   As for the dormancy periods, type in the ""name of plant dormancy period"" into google, and you should be able to find when that it is."
succulents,3c77u8,kittiemama,2,Mon Jul 6 02:58:07 2015 UTC,"Hey guys, so I've had this guy for almost exactly a year. I water it once a month and finally over winter I started to get new growth. I had it propped up with sticks just for added suport, but it was strong on it's own. I checked it on July 1st and decided to hold off watering until the rain stopped, I went to water it today and found it like this.  I only brought it outside to take the picture. I haven't changed anything. The other growth in the pot seem healthy."
succulents,3c77u8,kittiemama,2,Sun Jul 5 15:09:12 2015 UTC,"also, rocks hold moisture, it's harder for the water in the soil to evaporate and that's why gardeners use them to edge flower beds because it helps if you want to use less water. So I'd take off the big rocks in the succulent pots and if you want, you can add some decorative sand to keep it nice and dry for your cactus babies."

As to protesting: we ""sulk and pout"" amongst ourselves and go back to status quo ante... Not an approach conducive to change,  I suggest that provided there was a sincere and sustained interest in protesting administrative policies from Reddit admins, a more effective approach would be remaining open to all while undertaking discussions with other platforms/sites in view of an eventual migration of the community.  Such a move would have an insignificant impact on Reddit from the perspective of our sole niche sub, but could be potentially crippling if it was part of a coordinated and systematic movement from enough subs. Perhaps talks between sub mods could begin to explore such a possibility, and then approaches by a few designated ""emissaries"" to other platforms could be undertaken ""in bulk""?

succulents,3c5hre,Nizica,4,Sun Jul 5 00:08:17 2015 UTC,There are loads of succulents which tolerate alpine conditions.

succulents,3c5n8x,aseycay4815162342,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:11:36 2015 UTC,"I did some repotting tonight. Everything was in pots with no drainage! I put them in cactus/succulent soil in unglazed terra cotta with drainage holes.  First 2 pots were marked Haworthia enon at IKEA, which I think may be a subspecies/cultivar of Haworthia attenuata? They were all in 1 pot. There's 8+ rosettes (if that's what you call them), but could only really separate the 2 big clusters.  Next pot is some kind of Euphorbia, I think. I don't know which, though, a friend gave it to me. When I repotted it, I discovered there were about 3 separate clumps, and the base of one was really  yellow and unhealthy looking, so i separated the green portions and have it in a paper towel to dry before planting.  The next is not a succulent, and i'm not sure what it is. It's a cutting that the same friend gave to me. I've had it for about 2 weeks and haven't noticed any root growth. It only has the tiniest of root hairs. I don't really know what to do with it. I try to mist the soil around it every couple days.  The last is the sole remaining unrotted leaf of a Haworthia limifolia that i killed due to overwatering/no drainage (I didn't  what I was doing!) I don't think they propagate this way... so I'll probably throw it out soon. It's just shrivelling and not putting any hairs out or anything.  My Questions:  So! I've been trying to read up as much as I can, but I find a LOT of contradictory information out there about succulent care. It seems like I should get them as much light as possible, and wait 2-3 weeks between waterings, or until the soil is totally dry. At that point, I'm supposed to really soak them (as long as they have appropriate drainage), right? What does that mean? Water them until water runs out the drainage hole? I even tried to look for youtube videos but am still a little confused."
succulents,3c5n8x,wandering_meatloaf,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:28:57 2015 UTC,"I think your third plant is actually a Huernia (possibly some kind of zebrina but hard to tell without flowers).  On light:  It depends on the plant. Some plants prefer less light, some plants more. For example, I find that a lot of Huernias do better in slight shade. Blasting hot all-day sun doesn't seem to be their thing.  On watering:   Yep, let it dry before watering again. You can kind of approximate this with a pot with some of the same mix and no plant. Water it and check it later to see if it's dry. You want to really soak the media through, especially with a peaty mix. If you're using a generic C&S potting mix from the store, then chances are it has lots of peat. Water until a bunch of it drains from the bottom. You should be able to feel the pot getting heavier as the mix absorbs water.  For future reference, straight C&S potting mix (at least most brands) isn't suitable for a lot of succulents. It's usually too hygroscopic when wet, and too hydrophobic once dry. Most people who do use potting mixes add a very large portion of grit or something that helps with drainage (e.g. perlite or chicken grit). I think it's also good to add something that holds a bit of wtaer to assist in wetting the peat (e.g. pumice), since again it becomes hydrophobic once dry."

succulents,3c2s20,MAHHH,3,Sat Jul 4 05:39:15 2015 UTC,You're doing everything right. I did this with my aloe too. The pups looked like they were dying a week later after I separated them. It's now about 6 weeks later and they are growing roots and getting some of their color back. Just give it time.

succulents,3c2s20,reParaoh,2,Sun Jul 5 04:09:12 2015 UTC,"I got this aloe from my dad who has had it for over 30 years ( he tells me it is around 40 years old) and I decided that since it had set out bunches of babies and it was tipping over its pot that I should figure out how to replant the sucker.   I let the soil dry out and I separated the babies without incident, just some knocked off leaves but no root cutting needed. I made sure to remove the dirt from Mama aloe and her pups little roots systems without damaging the roots. I then set the pups aside in a warm shaded area for a few days to dry out while I replanted Mama right away as I was afraid that she would fall over and get hurt if she wasn't anchored down by dirt.   After re-potting everyone a few days later in a fast draining succulent mix with perlite, I waited a week to water. Everyone is currently in my south-facing sun room and the temperature is at about 75 degrees Fahrenheit. I water when the soil is dry.  What I'm dealing with now is thinning leaves which, from what I gathered, is from a lack of water? I haven't done anything drastic like douse the guys in water as much as I want to. I don't know much about succulents and I need help keeping these guys alive."

succulents,3c1oct,realizmbass,2,Sat Jul 4 02:52:09 2015 UTC,I have leaves on my balcony in indirect light facing east. At first I wasn't watering them until I saw roots. I sprayed the topsoil with water once a week until I saw some leaves shrivel up. Now I spray the them everyday or every other depending if the soil is dry.

Sharp sand and general purpose compost, a few small stones chucked in the bottom of the pot to aid drainage.   The biggest issue with succulents isn't what soil you use but how often you water them, so long as you let the soil dry out between watering you wont have any issues. If you water too often even with a free draining mix you're going to have issues with rot."

succulents,3c0oho,Popsfortuitous,2,Fri Jul 3 18:24:22 2015 UTC,"best way to check the water is to stick your finger in the soil. you don't want it to be moist all the time, just to let it dry out completely between them. meanehile I'm not sure. I once had an echevaria that was dying from the bottom up, but I suspect now it was due to root rot. keep it dry for a while, if the leaves srivel that means it wants more water, and if they don't unshrivel in a few days that could mean you already have rot.  if it comes to rot, you can cut off the head of the plant above the dying leaves, and you should be able to repot it when the wound is dry."

succulents,3c0qz0,Stormshaper,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:04:58 2015 UTC,Aloe vera does have those 'teeth'. I believe the discoloration is what happens when succulents receive a lot of sunlight. So it could very well be an aloe vera. (definitely from the aloe genus though)

succulents,3bxlh6,EatsButt,4,Fri Jul 3 00:05:58 2015 UTC,"I would wait at least 3 days so the break can heal over, then lightly every few days until it sprouts roots and then you can mist more regularly right at the roots. At least that's what has worked for me!"
succulents,3bxlh6,kryptonitewhale,2,Fri Jul 3 03:08:44 2015 UTC,"You will hear different answers from everybody you ask on these topics...  Personally I don't believe you need to mist at all.  But I still do mist lightly every few days if I see the leaves getting wrinkly but no obvious roots having formed yet.  But DO NOT EVER mist the leaves in the early part of the day such that the sun will hit the water -- little water droplets act as lenses and will cause irreparable burns to the leaves.  Some also say keep the soil dry to encourage root growth.  I disagree and like to lightly water periodically to let the roots know there's a reason to grow.  Until there is a body of reproducible scientific studies on this stuff, a lot of it is just going on intuition and relying on the fact that as long as you've figured out how not to kill your plants, they're pretty hardy little guys and will grow in almost any conditions you throw at them."
succulents,3bxlh6,stardigrada,2,Fri Jul 3 16:47:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Follow-up: while I'm waiting for the scab and initial bud, do they need a lot of (or any ) direct sunlight? Right now they are indoors in a bright room but not directly next to a window. Also do they need to be on soil right now? They are currently just sitting on a piece of paper."
succulents,3bxlh6,stardigrada,2,Fri Jul 3 20:14:47 2015 UTC,Direct sunlight can be damaging at this stage.  A healthy leaf has everything it needs to root in.  Indirect light is good.  They should ideally be placed on dirt as soon as roots start growing so that the roots can sink into and wrap around particles within the soil without being disturbed.  This usually will be between a week to a few months depending on plant and conditions.

succulents,3bwat0,manicbunny,3,Thu Jul 2 19:24:13 2015 UTC,"Hard to see exactly where it's positioned but probably overwatering, I assume that pot doesn't have drainage. With standard soil and no drainage you have to be extra careful with watering and should only water when the soil have completely dried out. You check this by either a chopstick or more a finger which is more accurate.   Depending if the roots are rotten or not, it might survive but you have to let the soil dry out. This would speed up if it's put into the sunniest spot possible and slip potted into a pot with drainage :)"

succulents,3bwat0,PM_ME_UR_PLANTS,2,Thu Jul 2 20:43:04 2015 UTC,I try to use rainwater that runs through a short gutter on my house. If it doesn't rain for a while I use tap water. We do have hard water.
succulents,3bwat0,acrystalmoon,2,Fri Jul 3 00:35:37 2015 UTC,"A thing you can do that might help is too water pretty thorough, and then poor out the extra out of the side of the pot to mimic draining. If drinking and evaporation are the only ways for water to leave the container, then you may have a build-up of salt concentration that makes drinking through osmosis difficult. It may not be the main reason for your issue, but it's a thing that's not good for the plant."
succulents,3bwat0,manicbunny,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:23:15 2015 UTC,Thank you. I hadn't thought of mineral build up. That could be it.
succulents,3bwat0,manicbunny,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:36:02 2015 UTC,Took a good look at the soil and it does appear to have some white and brown powdery substance on top. Could this be mineral residue or buildup?   http://i.imgur.com/HZDtrt9h.jpg

succulents,3by65e,AllAccessAndy,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:37:14 2015 UTC,"That's for root stock for grafted Euphorbia varieties. Grafting is usually more successful the more closely related the plants are. In many cases, grafting is done on different varieties within the same species or at least genus. In this case, Hylocereus and Gymnocalycium are both genera within the family Cactaceae, so grafting still works. In the case of grafting a true cactus to Euphorbia, the graft almost certainly wouldn't take as the plants are too distantly related."
succulents,3by65e,breedlovehoops,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:11:19 2015 UTC,"Okay, so once I cut it, i'd just let it sit for a while until it's like that? Also would it be possible to save the pink guy the same way?"

For commonly cultivated succulents you might start here: Illustrated encyclopedia to cacti and succulents (I think there's a newer edition but I don't have it so I can't comment on it).   For the more in depth stuff I would look at these titles (they can get pricey):  For Mesembs  For the Richtersveld (amazing place it holds like 30% of the total world succulent diversity)   Also for Mesembs but more expensive  For Conophtum  For Lithops (its in the pdf already)  For Madagascar (this book is amazing if you like caudiciforms, it has everything from plants to geology to meteorology).  For Aloes  ABE books is the place to go if you can't find them on Amazon.  Cactaceae has a lot of good books but I'm not very familiar with them but here's a few good ones.

succulents,3bwrfi,PM_ME_UR_PLANTS,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:40:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I had no idea that was the type of plant.   I got it at Trader Joe's; I'm not sure if you're familiar with California grocery stores but that is what it is. I use fountain water, water that I drink to water it. I water about enough so that it drips a little out the bottom and then I empty the bottom so it doesn't absorb the extra water. I probably first got it about two months ago and I let it sit in my lab for the first month without putting it outside at all (although it is under fairly bright light in here). Then it started to look a bit sickly so I started taking it outside, very sporadically and randomly. Sometimes for 3 hours at a time, sometimes for a whole weekend. It probably doesn't get a whole lot of direct sunlight because of the roofing of the porch, but probably a couple to several hours a day WHEN it is outside. Which is not usually too often. It gets a lot of light when it's in my lab."
succulents,3bwrfi,BackToTheBasic,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:40:17 2015 UTC,"Plants grow a lot better if they are given a consistent amount of light, not in random spurts.

succulents,3bsqxp,rebelkitty,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:08:05 2015 UTC,If you notice that the leaves or the plant in general starts spacing itself out or elongation happens then it needs more sun. Leaves falling off arn't necessarily bad. some succulents grow new leaves and grow out dropping the oldest leaves. Over watering is a thing so waiting until bone dry is the better idea.

succulents,3bsqxp,nicoleypants,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:55:49 2015 UTC,Putting them outside is always risky because it's hard to control the intensity of the sunlight. I had one I put outside that was doing wonderfully until there was a day without a cloud in the sky. It got pretty sunburned and is no long a perfect unharmed plant. Yours should be fine in the window if they're otherwise healthy :) Some people prefer the stretched out look of the stalks.

succulents,3bqls1,potatoninja,6,Wed Jul 1 10:27:29 2015 UTC,"DarklyNoon gave really good advice. They really do awesome with ""benign neglect"".  5 years ago my husband bought me a small little aloe. I put it in a bigger pot in regular potting soil(newbie mistake), set it outside in my yard and pretty much forgot all about it. The rain watered it for me. Then a few months ago, I noticed that the aloe not only looked much bigger, but it had multiplied and filled up that pot with over two dozen pups of all sizes. So I started reading about how to split it up and the proper care of aloes and now I have aloes planted all over my yard in the ground.   Now I use cactus soil mixed with perlite and only use unglazed terracotta pots."
succulents,3bqls1,isfjheartcaffeine,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:46:13 2015 UTC,"Haha, that sounds hilarious! Okay, I'm starting to feel a little bit better. I feel like your first approach is pretty much what my dad wanted to do - he has a green thumb and thought I was being ridiculous with cactus soil and not watering them for a week+. Congrats on the pups! I'll try and see if i can pick up some perlite while I'm at walmart or something today! Thank you so much for the info!! c:"
succulents,3bqls1,DarklyNoon,9,Wed Jul 1 13:53:50 2015 UTC,"Aloe has always done best for me with benign neglect. (And succulents/cacti in general) Let me take you through how I pot up my aloes.  Soil. I like to make my own soil. For aloe I like 50% topsoil (no peat), 30% perlite, 10% vermiculite, 10% coarse sand. Layer of river pebbles in the bottom of the pot for drainage. Again, peat in the mix is not great. If that is too much trouble, half perlite and half topsoil will be great too. I also like to cover my soil with pebbles or pea gravel.  Pots. Plain unglazed terra cota pots are HIGHLY preferred. Of course with drainage at the bottom. People grow them in plastic and glass and such all the time. However, they are much happier in a good plain breathable clay pot. They just do so much better for me. I'm zone 7a and get LOTS of humidity. Look up your USDA zone and it will help you know how to talk to your plants. If you want you can always decorate in the pot or get pots with a glazed rim. Pots in the sizes you would need are only $2 or so at the most.  Watering. Less is More! Succulents usually die from overwatering. You love them by loving them less. Wait until the soil is completely dry before watering. Pick your pots up and you can get an idea of how wet they are. If you use plain clay pots you can see how wet it still is as there is a color change when damp. Wait 3-4 days after the color goes back light for the center of the soil to dry.  Light. Aloe can deal with some pretty strong sun. They are happy with full sun in my 7a zone. However they have to be introduced to it slowly. From inside to full sun all day might take 2 months as you move them out of the shade a little more each few days.  Benign neglect. I have three small daughter plants that were inside and moved outside and got sunburned. I thought I had them in decent shade but it wasn't enough. They've been shoved into the back of my front porch and will get water and sun again when they start showing some green growth. I haven't watered in two weeks with 90 deg temps. Sometimes in the winter I forget and don't water for months. They're fine as long as they're inside away from frost.  The curling and yellowing of your plants seems to be from overwatering and low light. They'll be ok. Just neglect them a little and they'll love you for it. And use pots with drainage.  Tips brown naturally as the outermost leaves die and dry up, new leaves form in the center. Old aloe can actually form a stalk through this process.  For a fun plant that you can really water a lot and pay attention to; avocado pits are great. Toothpicks into pit in cup of water so it roots and then plant it when it makes a pair of leaves. Pinch the bud centers to keep from growing too tall too fast. Google it, lots of fun. Have one on my front porch right now.  Purslane is a great succulent that loves lots of water, full sun and is easy. You can also eat it in a salad and the flavor changes depending on the time of day from sweet to sour. It flowers constantly and the flowers open and close. Loves attention.  Plants all have their own needs and you just have to listen to what they want. Feel free to ask any questions.  Edit: typos and clarification."
succulents,3bqls1,DarklyNoon,3,Wed Jul 1 11:36:38 2015 UTC,"Wow, thank you so much for the in depth comment! I've been trying to stay hands off (apart from the constant picture taking and moving in and out for sun) so I think backing off a little is something I can do. Avacodo pits sound like a fun experiment that I'll have to try the next time we buy some avacados, thank you for the suggestion! I'll look into it more. c:  I checked out Canada's zones, and it looks like I'm in zone 6b. Not really too sure what that means. A friend who's had an aloe plant for a year or two now says she likes to plant her aloes into the ground during the Summer and repotting them to bring them in before Winter comes. She said it really helped her aloe grow bigger, better roots. I've been on the fence about that idea since we don't have as much outside space as she does, and I don't think my dad would appreciate me digging holes into his lawn or planting the Mama aloe in with his herbs. I guess a few more days without water couldn't hurt. I read that pups are especially water-sensitive so I've been worried about them. :c  Right now, they're all sitting in Miracle Grows Cactus soil (and Mama aloe has a thin layer of top soil to keep her from toppling). I read on a few threads last night that pots can be too big as well as too small. I'm not sure what a good size pot would be. I really like the glass container that one of the plants is in, but if it's not good for it, it's not worth it. I'll try and see if I can find some pots at a Garden Centre today. Repotting asap wouldn't be harmful would it? Each plant has been in its pot for about 3w (other than the plants in the nursery pot, those have been there for a while).  About the light - I've been waiting a few days for it to stop pouring here! I try to keep them out in my backyard on the nice days, but one night my dad thought I was depriving them of their water needs and he put them all out during a storm. I got them in (and turned the pots without drainage holes upside down to get as much excess water out as I could) and haven't watered them since. Its been about 8 days. They were out for a total of a day and a half before it started raining again. They're facing South windows right now (my garden is also on the South side, if that makes a difference) and soak up all the light that does come through. Mama aloe burned from being out in the front yard for a few days, so I brought her back in and she seemed to heal pretty quickly from that.  Ahh, I'm sorry I need so much help. It's like the first time I've taken care of something other than a robot baby for a parenting class a few years ago, but the experience feels pretty much the same! But everyone's pretty plants makes me want to keep trying. I'm glad I have so many pups, it makes it a little less daunting to keep tweaking whatever I can. Thank you so much for the time and effort you put into your replies. If it's not too much, I'd love to see pictures of your aloes!"
succulents,3bqls1,DarklyNoon,2,Wed Jul 1 11:59:58 2015 UTC,"I checked out Canada's zones, and it looks like I'm in zone 6b. Not really too sure what that means.   I'm not sure either. I think the Canadian zones are different from US zones but don't know. FWIW, North Alabama is 7a. It helps when reading about a plant to understand what it likes for light and humidity and such.   A friend who's had an aloe plant for a year or two now says she likes to plant her aloes into the ground during the Summer and repotting them to bring them in before Winter comes.   I've always grown it in pots and never had any trouble.   I guess a few more days without water couldn't hurt. I read that pups are especially water-sensitive so I've been worried about them. :c   They are still pretty tough. Bone dry for a few weeks wouldn't kill them, whereas damp for a few weeks could rot the roots out.   Right now, they're all sitting in Miracle Grows Cactus soil (and Mama aloe has a thin layer of top soil to keep her from toppling).   That is ok. Not great, but ok. (I can see peat in the mix). I hate peat. Hard to get it to take water and then hard to get it to dry. End up with root rot. I don't even like it for regular plants. However, my humidity levels are extreme. 90% + humidity at 90 to 100 deg Fahrenheit for weeks at a time.  You've mentioned the daughters and mother being loosely rooted. That is probably evidence of root rot.   I read on a few threads last night that pots can be too big as well as too small. I'm not sure what a good size pot would be.   Mama would probably like a 6-8"" pot and 4"" to 3"" for the rest.   I really like the glass container that one of the plants is in, but if it's not good for it, it's not worth it.    I wouldn't use it... plants breathe from their roots also.   I'll try and see if I can find some pots at a Garden Centre today. Repotting asap wouldn't be harmful would it? Each plant has been in its pot for about 3w (other than the plants in the nursery pot, those have been there for a while).   You might leave the ones in thin plastic for a while. Anything in glass or no drainage I would repot ASAP.   About the light - I've been waiting a few days for it to stop pouring here! I try to keep them out in my backyard on the nice days, but one night my dad thought I was depriving them of their water needs and he put them all out during a storm. I got them in (and turned the pots without drainage holes upside down to get as much excess water out as I could) and haven't watered them since. Its been about 8 days.    That's a good strategy for now. Don't leave them out during storms. The fresh moving air will make them happy.  Seriously, overwatering kills them. It may take a year or two to kill them from lack of water.   They're facing South windows right now (my garden is also on the South side, if that makes a difference) and soak up all the light that does come through.    South or West are best. Mine face south.   Ahh, I'm sorry I need so much help.

Thank you so much for the time and effort you put into your replies. If it's not too much, I'd love to see pictures of your aloes!   No problem! We don't learn if we don't ask. I'm about to go to bed (night shift) but will post a few pics tomorrow morning. Currently I only have the three sunburned daughters and one other that I'm getting healthy for a lady friend. (She overwatered and light starved the mother of the three until it died.) My son has a daughter plant from my first aloe, the mother plant died during a move(long story). It was over 12 years old. :-(   I'll show you avocado and Purslane as well."

And you're awesome for nursing plants back to health - I'm trying to convert my friends into plant lovers too so I can gift them all little baby aloes one day.   My part of town gets really smoggy before storms - but not too humid otherwise. For the sake of baby garden space and wanting them to be healthy before I experiment with such a move, I'll leave them in pots for now. I'll check up on the ones that feel loosely rooted (and repot the glass ones) as soon as I can. Black roots = no good, right? The miracle baby's roots were blackish but I couldn't tell if it was actually the root that was black or just the top soil. I'll investigate more later on. I'll have to read more into peat, I didn't even know what that was!  Thank you so, so, so much! If you ever have time and want to share your aloe story, I would love to hear it!

Healthy roots can be black, brown, yellow, white, sometimes even a little green. It just depends on soil and time of year and moisture level. Rotten roots will be shriveled, busted open, slimy or look like string. They may have a swampy smell instead of healthy dirt smell."

The three sunburnt daughters, starting to see a little green. Their soil and roots are good. Believe it or not, they'll be fine. Avocado. Growth buds have been pinched out several times to force branching and try to reduce height. They have fragile roots and repotting is often unsuccessful so you're better of starting with a decent size pot and trying to keep size down. Purslane. Bright red flowers open up about 10:00 AM. This plant was started from a small container 2 months ago. 2 weeks ago it was split into 3 parts. My Greek neighbor got some (he had another name for it and was happy to have it for cooking.) Lady friend got some as well. It is recovering nicely and covering the pot again. Center of pic is the aloe I'm getting happy for my lady friend. To the top right is Purslane that was split off a week ago from a larger pot that went with her. It had no roots but has started flowering 3 days ago. Bottom right is a Gymnocalycium cactus that is flowering. :-D My cactus frame. Total cost was $15 using scrap lumber from a fence I built, $10 for the window from Habitat for Humanity Re-Store, $5 for hinges and stuff. Keeps the rain off and the window screen shades the plants on the right side that need a little cover. My Greek neighbor gave me a gallon of paint that matches my siding. Maybe I'll get it painted this weekend. All kinds of babies in the frame."

How long did it take to collect so many cacti?  The little baby aloes are so tiny, oh man. This might be weird, but do you name your plants? The avocado plant also looks a lot prettier than I was imagining. In my head, I saw something similar to those sweet potato vine experiments you can do; this, is much cooler.   Wow, you really seem to have a green thumb. Your neighbour and lady friend are lucky to have you around, ahaha."

The entire leaf came off, none of the gel was exposed. I let it callus for 10 days or so and I've had it just like this in soil for months. The pot is shallow and does not drain, however I let it get dust try between watering, about every two weeks, and never soak it. At this time the leaf gets about 12+ hours of indirect sun everyday. I see no growth but it isn't exactly dying either. All good suggestions welcome!"

succulents,3bos7c,graffiti81,2,Wed Jul 1 04:17:48 2015 UTC,The leaf itself won't root and grow. Ideally you can propagate aloe by removing the pups but you can also propagate by removing roots just below the soil. This website has specific info on that process

succulents,3bo6gs,bmb222,2,Tue Jun 30 20:10:46 2015 UTC,Heads up- you're gonna want it bone dry until they begin a root system. Less likely to have ones that turn to mush. Around a month is a average-low end length

I've had by far the most success just keeping them indoors year round and setting them outside on particularly hot and dry days, because Its impossible to keep moving them in and out every time it rains.   I recommend finding a nice sunny indoor windowsill for the little guy! Open the windows on nice days, but that way it will be subjected to a relatively constant temperature indoors year round, instead of having to switch its climate to an indoor setting when winter sets in, and risking shock and deterioration."

I haven't had any issues leaving them out in the rain so far (and we've been getting plenty of it), as long as they get plenty of sun and have a well draining soil to dry them out pretty quick. I haven't had to water mine all summer and they're still doing perfectly fine. The only thing you have to worry about is later in September when the temperatures start dropping close to 40, that's pretty much the cut off point to when you'll need to bring them in."

succulents,3bl01h,emperor000,2,Tue Jun 30 12:57:37 2015 UTC,"You don't need rooting hormone for jades, or most succulents. It would actually probably deter/hinder root development.  It might sound like an exaggeration, but a cutting of a branch is virtually guaranteed to develop roots if you just leave it on the soil and don't let it get too hot or too cold. They just might not grow from the base.  Leaves probably have a 50% chance, and that is being ""generously"" low."

succulents,3bl01h,emperor000,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:24:49 2015 UTC,"Well, does it look like they are...?  You're right though, they often will eventually, but I think that is long past when they should have been pruned by hand. And I'm not sure I would ""trust"" their styling decisions :) I also don't think it is as good for the plant. I don't think you'll get compact growth from self pruning. It's going to stay pretty spindly like this and the weaker branches will just fall off. From my experience those are often the smaller, newer branches that you'd want to encourage to get larger."

Is there a certain amount of time that I have to propogate them by (I know I have to let them seal over but I don't want them dying in that process from being out of the soil too long)
succulents,3bkn0x,GhettoGopher,2,Tue Jun 30 00:54:32 2015 UTC,You have to let the ends of the leaves dry out and callus over. This can take a couple days to a week. Just eye ball it as best you can. Then place it on the soil so it can begin drawing moisture.

succulents,3bibxy,_martin_,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:05:06 2015 UTC,"It's been this way for a week, maybe two. It had rained off and on for a couple of days before I first noticed the wrinkling, but I watered it anyway, thinking since it's in a small pot on a concrete patio that gets morning sun, it might be drying out faster than the others. It seemed to plump up a little right after that, but the wrinkles are still there despite multiple waterings. The leaves still feel pretty firm overall - definitely not soft like when they are about to rot or fall off. It's in a terra cotta pot with 50/50 perlite/potting soil. Can anyone tell what's causing this?  (Bonus Question - I have two of these. One was bought at Lowe's, and just said ""Asstd. Echeveria"" on the label. The other was bought at Walmart, and the label says it is Echeveria 'Princess Blue'. When I Google Princess Blue, the leaves are much wider and flatter. Were these mislabeled, or were they both just mistreated at the store and that's why they look different?)"
succulents,3bibxy,isfjheartcaffeine,2,Mon Jun 29 13:45:17 2015 UTC,"How long have you had the plant? Did you acclimate it to the sun when you brought it home? What's the weather like in your area?

I am a little confused by this. If the tips are splitting you are probably overwatering. A small amount of leaves dying isn't super unusual, as long as it's growing more overall. But I'm not sure if it should be growing at all, depending on what kind of weather you've been having lately. I only say this because my Fenestraria is currently quite asleep due to the summer heat. I haven't watered it for a month and it hasn't wrinkled or done much of anything. Do you have pictures?   Is there an easy way to propgate these?   Once it's big enough you can separate clumps of them with part of the root structure and propagate it that way. I would personally wait until right before the active season to do this."
succulents,3birbc,roflcopter-pilot,2,Mon Jun 29 15:47:55 2015 UTC,"Hey guys and gals, please help me ID those two succulents that I rescued!  Story behind them:   The first one I rescued from a local supermarket - they sold several palettes full of various plants in small pots, including such succulents. While one of the employees of the market rearranged stuff on the shelfs, an empty pot fell from the top shelf and plunged all the way down to the bottom shelf, crushing one particular succulent in the process. I happened to walk by just then, picked up the pot for her and the succulent that stopped its fall. She thanked me and proceeded to pull the succulent out of its pot (they were in a plastic container inside the pots), only to toss it onto the garbage pile next to her! Out of pity I asked why, and if I could have it - she agreed and put a discount sticker on it, so I ended up only paying one buck for the little pot, and getting the plant for free. After getting it home I removed the stupidly small plastic container and put it properly in that pot, where it nicely recovered from the hard hit and has since more than doubled in size! :)  The other I rescued from the spot in our company parking lot where I park my car. We have the whole roof of our five story building covered with those succulents. They help us clean the rain water, which is collected in a cistern and used for the toilets in the building. How this particular little group of cuttings happened to get down from the roof and how it managed to successully root and grow within a crack on my car's space of the dry, hot parking lot is beyond me, but when I saw it today I had the urge to rescue it before it gets run over. Luckily it was small enough to hide away until recently, but now it started sticking up from its hideout. Since it seems to be a ground-covering plant (at least that's the way it grows on our company building's roof, it's like a huge, colorful, living carpet) that unused little bonsai pot I had in a corner seemed a good new home for the little succulent cuttings. Let's see if they like it..."

The unfortunate thing about plants that grow like this is they won't get thicker where they're already thin, so any healthier growth weighs down itself till it'll probably snap.  Frankly if the cat gets a snout full of glochids/spines that's his fault, and it'll certainly teach him a lesson.  It's usually better not to house cacti in glass without sufficient drainage holes at the bottom, you have to be more careful with watering than what would be usual , but don't be stingy with the watering either.  Anyways depending on how thick the growth is I would say you should either let it through the screen or take off the thin growth and get it some better light (although gradually, cause cacti can be sunburnt too )."
succulents,3bfdo3,Popsfortuitous,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:04:11 2015 UTC,"Sorry, you're right, I should've taken a pic. Will rectify tonight.  In the meantime, it's not thin or gangly, it's a uniformly thick single shaft of a cactus.   It's really doing well in its environment -- too well. I keep telling my  husband to just take it out and put it in something with more room and hopefully where the cat can't get to it, but he wanted to know if the experts here had any novel suggestions."
succulents,3bfdo3,Souperhans,2,Mon Jun 29 14:45:47 2015 UTC,"How is the lighting? It may need stronger artificial lights to satisfy the plants needs, especially if it's stretching as much as you say"
succulents,3bfdo3,kallan133,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:59:53 2015 UTC,"It's by a window that gets enormous amounts of sun - almost all day.  I think it's enough, because it's really growing faster than anything I've ever seen. It's not stretching, as towards the light, it's bending, because it hit the roof of the tank and has nowhere to go."
succulents,3bbm2p,reParaoh,3,Sat Jun 27 17:44:35 2015 UTC,First Haworthia looks like it might be a cuspidata. The fasciata is actually an attenuata - fasciata are fairly rare and easily confused with attenuata.

succulents,3bbm2p,BananaBlue,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:10:53 2015 UTC,"Your Haworthias seem to be in great shape. What's your trick for a watering schedule for keeping them at their best. I have in the past gone between drying out my roots to (more often) rotting them… I can't seem to get the balance. Is this a succulent who likes the dryer side or the water side (and yes, I know that all succulents dont like too much water)."
succulents,3bbm2p,besthuman,2,Sat Jun 27 20:15:55 2015 UTC,"I uhh.. They are all in little pots that dry out fairly quickly, and even then I usually water them less than once a week i guess... I only water them when they start to look a little wrinkly. Like a lithops or something. It's harder to tell with the h attenuata because he doesn't get wrinkly. But the window ones look a little less full when they are thirsty, and they pop right back up within an hour or two of watering!! I drench the pot so it flows all over out the bottom. Honestly in my experience they are tough little buggers. /shrug.  My indoor temps under their grow light there range between 77 at night and 91 during the day when the sun starts peaking in, 30-40% humidity. But i try to keep them out of the direct west sun, only the grow light, so high temps might be a little lower.. You can see that one (third picture on the right) is looking a little burned from too much light. But it wants the most water and has the shallowest pot. If that helps."

succulents,3bcin7,Astilaroth,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:08:40 2015 UTC,They flower in late fall/winter. You start seeing the flower buds in the fall. So when the sun starts getting lower in the sky and the days get shorter and it gets cooler they will start making flowers.  What environment do you keep yours in? How large and old is yours?
succulents,3bcin7,emperor000,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:55:19 2015 UTC,"Not sure about the age, at least ten years i think. Size... about 50 cm tall and 70 cm wide approximately.

We have windows on either the north or south."
succulents,3bcin7,Astilaroth,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:05:12 2015 UTC,"South facing windows are better. But for it to bloom, it probably has to go outside when it is warm and inside when it is too cold."

Actually (and this is where I am ashamed of my pre-succulent-loving-self), I kinda forgot it on a balcony at my previous place a few years ago. Found it again in spring. It had survived the whole winter but had very shriveled leafs and it had fallen over making it grow all crooked.

succulents,3bcvsa,pnwbg,8,Sun Jun 28 00:45:55 2015 UTC,"It probably got too much water, so the roots have rotted off and now the plant isn't getting any water. Remove any firm parts and trim off any rot. Let the healthy pieces callous over for several days and then replant into dry soil that drains better. Be more careful with watering in the future."
succulents,3bcvsa,AllAccessAndy,3,Sun Jun 28 01:51:37 2015 UTC,"This covers it pretty well. Soil like that with high amounts of organics in small particulate form is great for seedlings- and a death sentence for older plants especially if it is not getting good warmth and high sunlight. It is rotted and the stems will go next, you can always try cutting off the dead parts and hoping it roots. Best thing for succulents is terra-cotta and gritty mixture ran through a screen. It will live way longer. Also they need way way less water unless they are getting good direct sunlight outside"

succulents,3bbrrz,PabloDiablo43,4,Sat Jun 27 22:55:08 2015 UTC,"Aerial root growth can be a sign that your plant wants new roots in general because the roots beneath the soil are not in optimal conditions, or that the humidity is too high for the plant's comfort.  Take a look at the soil. Are the roots waterlogged or root-bound? It could also mean your plant isn't getting enough water for some reason. Take note if the leaves that drop off are firm or shriveled when they fall."

There as four of them, but the forth died on me because there wasn't enough room for him.  1) I've been trying to figure out a watering schedule. My cousin, who has a bunch of them says once a week with just a little bit of water, while my father say water them once a month fully and then spay them weekly. Which is better?  2) The planter has holes in the bottom of it, but I think that I'm going to switch them to a large round pot. Should I wait to winter to do so?  3) I currently have them sitting in my window and they get a good amount of indirect sun. Since it's now summer should I move them outside to a somewhat sunny area. My back deck get direct sunlight in the morning and then is pretty much shady all day long. Is this correct?   Thanks in advance."

succulents,3bbg2k,Chtulhu_Cult,2,Sat Jun 27 16:51:10 2015 UTC,I usually just set the leaves on top of the soil with my Regular pots and water them with the plant. If they've already got roots you should cover them slightly but have them do their own rooting.
succulents,3bbg2k,smokesinquantity,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:38:16 2015 UTC,"What I normally do is take a large pot, 8-12 inches across, fill it with free draining succulent soil and not too much perlite or no perlite at all, take your cuttings, (make sure it's a clean break) and take the tips, the ones that came off the stem and lay them down so the tips go into the soil but the rest of the leaf lays on top of the soil/perlite. Then mist the top of the soil completely and re-mist the soil when it dries out completely. Don't take the leaves out at all! (It's hard not to keep looking at them) some leaves will shoot roots as quickly as 2 weeks while others after 2 months but on average most will be 4 weeks with roots and/or leaves.

I am very much a beginner with gardening/succulents in general, so any advice is appreciated. I need help identifying these two guys I just bought.   They're just in plastic pots now so I am going to want to re-pot them. Not sure how good all the rocks are for them, or what kind of soil to look for.   The first one doesn't seem to have roots that go very deep into the soil at all. not sure if this is normal, or there are too many rocks et or what.  the cactus one seems to be pretty healthy, but I really can't tell.   Do these guys look like they are healthy?   Should I expect them to grow much bigger, or produce any flowers?   How often and by what method should I be watering them, and how can I tell if they need more or less water, etc?   I live in Australia, so generally it doesn't get very cold. Maybe 50s (farenheit) in the winter. I will be keeping them inside but I have a couple rooms in the house that have plenty of sunlight.  Any other general advice or help is much appreciated!! Thanks in advance :]"
succulents,3b9bju,Thorsstar,2,Sat Jun 27 01:03:09 2015 UTC,"Not an expert at gowing succulents but here's my two cents :   Clay pots or even a wooden planter (made some my self ) is fine. For soil I use a mix of  regular vegi garden soil,  and pearlite with some rocks at the bottom of the pot/planter for better drainage(make sure what ever pot/planter has drainage holes to help prevent root rot).  Succulents and cacti like to have their roots shallow and wide, and not be deep.  ---and the rocks( on top of the soil) help keep the moisture so you don't have to water much."
succulents,3b9bju,cheesezombie,2,Sat Jun 27 01:49:50 2015 UTC,"They look fairly healthy! Here are my base rules for succulents:   Water when all of the soil is dry. When you do water, be sure you water until all the soil is soaked and it begins to run out if the pot. Then wait for all the soil to dry again before repeating. If the leaves begin to look withered but still healthy overall, they likely need a bit more water. If they start to change color and look sickly from the bottom upwards, you're likely watering too much. Use soil that lends itself to draining well. If you're nervous it's prone to compacting (which traps moisture and can lead to dying succulents and plant rot), add in some perlite or vermiculite. This helps aerate the soil and improve drainage. I sometimes also add a layer of gravel to the bottom, although not essential. Make sure it gets lots of sun!  Repot when they start to fill the pot. These can grow quite a bit, so I usually start no smaller than pots with 3"" diameter  for babies and jump up as they grow."
succulents,3b9bju,cheesezombie,2,Sat Jun 27 03:19:33 2015 UTC,"cool :] i'll head to the store probably tomorrow and look for some new pots, gravel, soil, etc and re-pot them. any strategies for re-potting to make sure I don't damage them?   Do you have any idea what kind these are? I've seen some sorta similar ones to the non-cactus one, but with different leave shapes. this one for example but i have no clue what kind it is. Or maybe Echeveria derenbergii? I googled those and they look sorta similar too but not exactly.  how often do you typically water? Once a day/week/etc?"
succulents,3b9bju,cheesezombie,2,Sat Jun 27 03:32:25 2015 UTC,"Just avoid damaging roots. I try to massage the soil to nudge it out of the compacted container shape without tearing them.

They were selling these beautiful Coral Cacti in attractive pots (with no drain holes) and there was a plastic, glued down top on the pot.  The plastic was molded to look like stones. Pretty tacky actually.    I liked the plant a lot but the way it was potted really turned me off and I decided not to buy one as a result.    Really cool looking plant though."

succulents,3b933x,Popsfortuitous,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:41:32 2015 UTC,Hi. Quick answer because I need to go but will come back and write a longer reply. It will be fine for now. Wait until pups are bigger to separate. They grow faster when still attached.
succulents,3b933x,thecakeisnotalie,1 point,Sat Jun 27 08:34:14 2015 UTC,"Alright, I suppose that gives me a bit of time before I need to get potting. Also no worries, I look forward to the response later.  What's kinda unfortunate is it looks like it lost one of its larger leaves some time ago, and was probably cleaned away. Would have been nice to try to propagate from a large cutting like that and have the main plant/plantlets."
succulents,3b933x,thecakeisnotalie,2,Sat Jun 27 12:06:27 2015 UTC,"It looks like a gasteria verrucosa but it is hard to tell from the photo. You could move it from the plastic pot to the terracotta pot. This will give you the chance to have a look at the roots. If the larger pups have enough roots to them (2 or 3), then you separate them with a clean blade but I honestly would not bother until they get bigger or if the roots of the main plant completely fill the pot (it will eventually happen when it gets bigger). Good luck."

succulents,3b6ab4,ThePortalTriton,1 point,Fri Jun 26 09:04:11 2015 UTC,"They need way more light, if you can put them outside in the sunlight (slowly introduce them into direct sunlight) then they should gain some health. If you can't then getting an appropriate bulb would do them a world good, make sure to do proper research.  You shouldn't prune them until they are completely healthy, at the moment they are not getting enough energy and pruning could kill them.  With regards to watering, you should give the soil a good soaking and water when the soil dries out again (poke a finger in to feel the soil). How much water they need changes with the environment, so a dark day will lead to the soil drying out slower compared to a sunny day :)"
succulents,3b6ab4,manicbunny,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:26:10 2015 UTC,Thank you. I'll try putting them outside. I'm bummed that a southern window isn't enough. I'll have to get a bulb for sure for winter.

succulents,3b6ab4,AllAccessAndy,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:53:53 2015 UTC,"Part of the problem is that they probably need more water. 30ml isn't enough for that sized pot, even indoors, even being non porous."

succulents,3b5lcr,Great_Plattsby,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:56:18 2015 UTC,pups might grow from where the leaves were!  my ghost did.    also warn your neighbor cause certain succulents are poisonous to pets.   you also have two choices.  to cut the head (too but where most of the leaves are gathered) off and pluck any stray leaves from the main stem while leaving the main stem where it is (since its rooted it's best to leave it planted)  or just simply leaving it as it is and see how it turned out.  but ugly in the meantime but you'd be surprised.
succulents,3b5lcr,doablysad,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:15:04 2015 UTC,So where would you recommend cutting it off? Closer to the base or up top?
succulents,3b5lcr,doablysad,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:06:23 2015 UTC,top maybe 3-4 inches.  nothing too short. but nothing too long.  if you go this route. let it callous and dry before placing in soil. then water once (full watering) and not again till it grows roots.  takes about 1-2 weeks. and keep it in a shaded area with no direct sun.
succulents,3b5lcr,doablysad,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:36:37 2015 UTC,"So I should cut the top 3-4"", and place it in a new pot?"

Honestly, I might consider cutting it at the joints, getting a bigger pot and potting up all the cuttings together and letting it regrow.   Either that or get some wood, like 2x4s or something and wrap it in shrink wrap with those as support."
succulents,3b3q82,graffiti81,7,Thu Jun 25 19:15:57 2015 UTC,"Either of those would work. If you take cuttings make sure they callous over first. If I were in your boat, I would chop it into pieces and take all of it."

succulents,3b58py,simonladesma,3,Fri Jun 26 02:01:32 2015 UTC,"They don't look too bad. The Lithops look like they were grown a tad too fast, as is common in big nurseries, but that's about it. This means a weaker plant, at least for now.   Not sure on this one, I've got no experience with it. I've seen it done, but I don't know that it's the best for either plant to do so. I have always planted different species separately, not to mention genera. If the nights are still quite hot (I'd say around 70F or 80F is a ""hot"" night) both will probably be dormant and don't require water. Some Lithops respond to hot nights by wrinkling a tad. You can check them for wrinkles in the morning - if they still have wrinkles the morning after, you can give them a little spraying. Some might just stay a little wrinkled throughout their summer dormancy. Pleiospilos is a lot less picky about its annual cycle, and about receiving more light and heat. Whereas Lithops tend to scorch and die in the blasting heat and sun, Pleiospilos usually does OK assuming they were grown well and are given adequate ventilation. I water Pleiospilos sporadically throughout the summer, give it more water through fall, and then once the new center leaves look nice and fat and it has finished flowering, I let it sit relatively dry until the outer leaves are gone before resuming water gradually. This is a good thread to look through. There are many very, very experienced growers that chimed in on that thread. Think about how advice you read would apply given your unique growing situation. Steve Hammer's ""The New Mastering the Art of Growing Mesembs"" should be floating around somewhere on the web, and is also a good resource to look at."

succulents,3b56c7,cheesezombie,2,Fri Jun 26 01:40:18 2015 UTC,Let it rest for a couple days in shade to callous over where the root used to be. Then you can set on top of the soil in a pot and it should start growing a new root soon.   This is why succulents are cool. You think you killed them but they have their way of coming back.

succulents,3b2c8c,autowikibot,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:19:27 2015 UTC,"Dudleya gnoma:       Dudleya gnoma is a rare species of succulent plant in the stonecrop family known by the common names munchkin liveforever and munchkin dudleya. It is endemic to Santa Rosa Island, one of the Channel Islands of California, where it is known from one single population containing about 3200 plants.  The population was discovered in the 1950s and assumed to be a relative of Dudleya greenei, a plant also occurring on the island which is similar but larger and contains the same number of chromosomes.   The plant was not described to science until 1997.  The population is protected from nearby grazing cattle by a fence.  It still faces threats from deer, which can get past the fence, a limited gene pool, and the fact that a single severe event such as a drought, could eliminate the single population.  Though rare in the wild, this dudleya is kept in cultivation by gardeners and enthusiasts of succulents, and a cultivar called 'White Sprite' is popular.

They're the reason I got into succulents, when a friend gifted me a medium-size cluster of them several years ago. I had no idea how to care for them, so I just left them outdoors and did nothing, eventually forgetting about them. That's how I learned that they're utterly indestructible! Those plants survived being crushed by a giant rock and left under it for an entire very cold, snowy winter. I still have them in the crushed plastic pot and they've grown back even bigger than before since then. I started to collect other succulents because they're so easy to keep alive and happy, and even when you mess up and break one you've just got two plants now."

succulents,3b3j9s,greenish_thumb,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:55:53 2015 UTC,"while you're trying to get them to propagate it might be a good idea to mist them once in a while. I'm not sure about aloes but generally it's better the soil they're on isn't too moist, if the leaves are big enough they'll only need misting every few days, oh, and some luck I guess. If you notice roots starting, take note, it's okay to keep misting until there are enough roots, but when you plant them make sure they and the soil are dry, and then you can soak your pot. That should do them well until they start growing again, aside from the 1 inch rule."

succulents,3b0evq,alohacat,2,Wed Jun 24 23:32:45 2015 UTC,"Hee, that's an echevaria, very nice to have found it already flowering, if taken care of you can expect it do do that every year around the same time~  First thing, before you put it on a bright balcony, how much light was it getting before? If you don't let it get used to higher light levels over the course of a week or so you could sunburn it. I recommend either moving it into a bright, shady space, and then slowly increasing the times it receives direct sun, or having some shade cloth over it to help.  Watering isn't going to be that fussy, if the soil drains well and that pot has good drainage holes you should be fine watering it when the first inch of soil is dry. make sure though that that soil drains, if it has too much peat in it, be careful watering until the flowers are done, and then  repot in a freer mix of sand and soil. If you repot, don't use wet soil, and don't water for around a week to let the roots heal any damage.  If it gets too cold outside in the winter (sounds like from zone 6) lower the watering you do over the course of the fall, this helps the plant stay healthy over the season even with less light, and it shouldn't grow too much during the cold season, otherwise the growth it puts out will get leggy and thin from too little light.  Overall I hope you'll enjoy your new plant, and don't hesitate to let us redditors know if something's up!"

It's next to the windowsill now, I will leave it out for a few hours of evening sun tomorrow and slowly integrate it through the week.   I will probably wait a while to re-pot, maybe once the flowers are gone. Is there a certain brand/mix I should be looking for?   For the winter, I plan on bringing it inside and putting it next to the window. It definitely won't survive out there! Thank you for your help."

I personally used a miracle grow potting soil, took out most of the peat, and mixed half and half with sand. Then again that's the mix my opuntiads are in, and they're a pretty hardy species. as long as you're able to get a mix without, or take out peices of peat and excess bark, that also has perlite in it, an mix with sand or some other grit ( and if you want to be fancy, somehow find a brick of coconut coir to mix a portion into ) you should be fine. general rule is, the soil must drain well enough that if you soak the pot fully the water streams out for a bit, rather than just dripping"

succulents,3b1amx,TehRayRay,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:06:00 2015 UTC,"looks like you have spider mites. I've heard spraying the leaves with soapy water OR dusting them with cinnamon or sulphur helps, but if they're in the roots you may have to kill them all, I would recommend an alcohol and water solution, as long as the solution is 30% water it won't harm the plants but will kill the mites on contact. If you leave it outside there's a good chance the infestation will fester, spread, and possibly kill your plant, so find some rubbing alcohol and a spray bottle, mix with some water, and spray it down if you haven't watered too recently"

You can remove the dead leaves for cosmetic purposes, but the longer you leave them on, the more of the nutrients in them the plants can absorb back (and put toward new growth).  Even the dead leaves falling into the soil restores some nutrients back to the soil as well as preventing weed growth and serving as mulch to prevent excess evaporation."

succulents,3avvf8,holy-ghost,2,Tue Jun 23 22:36:04 2015 UTC,"Patience is so important when growing succulents. If you want the baby aloes to grow faster, its better to leave them with the mother plant as long as possible.  If they are already separated, then you can supplement with fertilizers/plant food. I'm not sure if a smaller pot will encourage faster growth. I know that you want a pot that just fits right, not too big or too small, with proper succulent soil that is fast draining."
succulents,3avvf8,isfjheartcaffeine,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:58:15 2015 UTC,"If you put them in a restrictive container, the roots will just circle around and around in the pot anyway. Plants with a healthy root system grow fastest and healthiest!"

Of course it was for sale in Europe on around 2 different sites, but phytosanitary certificates are way too expensive. Hopefully I can keep it alive, sounds like it has proven to be tricky for some.  I ordered up some semihyodroponic medium to try with this, does anyone know much about it? It has been making me scratch my head- super arid landscape plants that normally rot under even slightly too much water can be put in clay-type pellets and kept constantly moist with water always in the bottom 20% of the pot... and they thrive this way.  If all goes well I'll have seeds for sale/trade in about 5 years, takes a long time to mature but it has both male/female flowers on one plant which is awesome. Cucumbers that it produces are edible, so I'll be trying that out.  Edit: There's one left currently listed, I'll PM the link to people who send a message. They have been periodically listing specimens recently but they go fast."

succulents,3atvsl,candied_ginger,2,Tue Jun 23 23:27:34 2015 UTC,"Overwatering is related to how well your soil drains.   If your soil drains perfectly, you can literally water every single day and you won't get root rot.   If looks like your soil is peat-heavy, which means you'll have to be careful about overwatering.   Do all of your containers have drainage holes?"
succulents,3avdds,Sosayslori,2,Tue Jun 23 20:24:23 2015 UTC,Mine that I keep outside all year round in Oregon (several sedums) usually go semi-dormant like this in the hot parts of Summer. Wouldn't worry about it much unless the stems are dying- which also happens to some degree with mine but not extensively. They can reroot themselves if the bases die.
succulents,3avdds,bmb222,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:32:50 2015 UTC,Thanks! Yeah the rest of it still looks pretty healthy. It has been moved into a shady part of the patio because I live in California and it's been between 90 and 103 degrees outside so I had a feeling that's what did it.
succulents,3avb2c,bubbaa11,3,Tue Jun 23 20:07:34 2015 UTC,"The frequent watering is not good for succulents. You want the soil to become dry in between waterings. For most succulents, in the summer you can water once a week and then cut down to once a month or less in the winter. (this depends also on where you live too)  You may want to consider cutting the stem off and letting the top part of the plant grow new roots."
succulents,3avb2c,isfjheartcaffeine,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:39:17 2015 UTC,"Okay. As for the watering, I will cut back. When I looked up how they should be watered, what i found repeatedly was warnings that people incorrectly think that because they are desert plants that they should be watering infrequently. One site inparticular made an analogy that just because you can survive like three days without water doesn't mean that you should only drink every three days. so  I was trying to just water it like a normal plant. So i guess my question is should I wait until the soil is completely dry, or just dry on the top? also do i need to have a pot that lets the water drain really well? i saw a lot of people using stones in their pots too. should i be doing that?  As far as the cutting the stem thing, I would appreciated a sort of guide for how to do that.... or direction to one. I really don't know what i would do for that. Just snip it and place it back on the soil? should i like cut the middle part of the stem out and put the top part onto the roots in the soil, or should i just remove all of the roots and then let them regrow the roots completely? sorry for all the questions. I live alone and this succulent has become like my child. I really want it to do well, and flower if i can get it to."
succulents,3avb2c,isfjheartcaffeine,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:01:42 2015 UTC,"I completely understand! I love succulents an abnormal amount too. My kids don't like it when I call my new plants my babies. Ok back to the point.   You want the soil to be completely dry before you water again, and when you water, soak them! They like their roots to ""air out"". Yes, you want a pot that that has a drainage hole, unglazed terracotta pots are the best, IMO. You'll also need soil that is fast draining and ""airy"". I haven't found any good succulent soil mixes in the box stores in my area, so I made my own. Info on soil recipes . I personally use a mix of perlite, chicken grit and the miracle gro cactus mix. But there are lots of different soil recipes that work well too.   You don't have to put stones in your pots. Some people like it for decoration. Too many stones can keep your soil moist which is what you are trying to avoid and make it difficult to determine if you need to water again.   There are many websites that provide info on propagation. This is one websitethat has information on propagating cuttings. Basically, cut the stem somewhere in the middle, let the plant rest in the shade in a shoebox or tray (for example) for a few days to let it callous over."
succulents,3auz8b,-atash-,6,Tue Jun 23 18:46:18 2015 UTC,Looks like an under watered jade. The leaves wrinkle when they need water.
succulents,3auz8b,aviguyael,5,Tue Jun 23 23:33:43 2015 UTC,"I second this. My jade leaves become thin and wrinkled when underwatered. After I thoroughly soak the soil and allow it to drain out, my jade leaves usually plump up again in about 24-48 hours. Good luck!"
succulents,3auz8b,JustAnINFJ,4,Tue Jun 23 23:57:57 2015 UTC,"Depending on the plant, they have either Summer or Winter dormancy. If the roots are NOT rotting form too much moisture and not enough porosity of the soil, it is likely just slowing itself down.  Now that I mention possible root-rot, you may want to check it if it keeps getting worse. Before I switched to gritty-mix type potting medium, or medium ran through a screen, I would occasionally have some serious root death even when being careful."
succulents,3auz8b,bmb222,2,Tue Jun 23 20:34:59 2015 UTC,How often are you watering?  Succulents have plump leaves because of how they store water. Seems like the plant might not be getting enough depending watering schedule since they're wrinkling and losing the succulent plumpness.

succulents,3aphze,keekzula,15,Mon Jun 22 13:16:42 2015 UTC,The fungi are called Leucocoprinus birnbaumii known as the flower pot mushroom. They are saprobes not parasites and won't do harm to your cacti. Applying poisons to non parasitic fungi is not the way to go. Just pick them they may pop up again if they get lots of rain.
succulents,3aphze,najjex,9,Mon Jun 22 16:51:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah the stuff that I looked up about them said that the mushrooms themselves weren't harmful, I'm just worried about the soil being moist enough for mushrooms and too moist for cacti."

succulents,3aphze,THE_PULLOUT_KING,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:58:29 2015 UTC,What exactly are you using? I thought my mix was porous enough but I still have the store-bought cactus soil mixed in.
succulents,3aphze,JaseKian,3,Mon Jun 22 21:42:40 2015 UTC,"The recipe I use (which AFAIK is derived from bonsai methods) is:    1 part chicken grit (crushed granite) 1 part Turface (calcined clay)  1 part screened pine bark    It was kind of a pain to get set up initially, but has been amazing ever since -- drains basically instantly, very very little perched water, not prone to salt build-up, lasts for years (can just up-pot instead of bare-rooting to remove broken down peat-based medium). It's also very weighty which can be nice for top-heavy cacti. The major drawback is that it's almost a cousin of hydroponics, so requires fertigating with a complete, water-soluble fertilizer. I just put a few squirts of Dyna-Gro 9-3-6 in my watering can each time, but in terracotta during the dog days that can mean every day or two, so it's probably too high maintenance for a lot of folks."

Probably want to treat with a fungicide as well. Allow them to rest bare root for at least two weeks; excise and treat any rotted portions.  I was not able to save my cactus.
succulents,3aphze,code-brown,8,Mon Jun 22 14:13:59 2015 UTC,Leucocoprinus birnbaumii. This type of fungus won't hurt cacti or succulents -- this particular species is after nutrients and waste in the soil and isn't parasitic. It may have been the extra moisture in your soil that harmed your cacti. Sorry to hear you lost one though!

succulents,3as4kb,isfjheartcaffeine,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:08:35 2015 UTC,"You can definitely propagate by cutting the branches, just let the stem scab over and pull off the bottom leaves from the branches before you plant them.  I am fairly certain it's an echeveria instead of a sempervivum (hen and chicks), but the one sure way to tell would be when it flowers. Echeveria have stalks of blooms from the sides of the stem and sempervivum have flowers blooming from the crown."

succulents,3apsgk,DarklyNoon,2,Mon Jun 22 14:57:23 2015 UTC,"Where are you located that you can't find perlite? Home Depot and Lowe's both carry it in my area. Those white pebbles on top will only hold the moisture in and prevent erosion from watering, they won't promote aeration and fast draining.  Perlite feels and weighs like rough Styrofoam beads, it is porous unlike most rock. Maybe you could get ahold of pumice.  I use pea gravel in some succulent mixtures, but there is also perlite, coarse sand and topsoil in there.  I consider perlite the prerequisite for growing succulents and put it in any soil mixture. Most non succulent plants benefit as well."
succulents,3apsgk,DarklyNoon,3,Mon Jun 22 15:12:29 2015 UTC,"I'm in Singapore, but I went to a really small store. I'll try again this weekend, should be able to get it at a larger nursery. The pebbles aren't on the top only, they're mixed throughout the soil. Is that better..?"
succulents,3apsgk,DarklyNoon,2,Mon Jun 22 15:38:10 2015 UTC,"A little better. Still not great as after a few waterings the soil will compact and not drain well. Pumice, crushed lava rock, perlite. Maybe you could find a larger gardening center on the outskirts of the city. I believe orchid growers sometimes also use perlite."
succulents,3apsgk,cheesezombie,2,Mon Jun 22 19:45:27 2015 UTC,"Ok, I'll get my hands on something! Would it be too soon to repot them again?"

succulents,3aqijv,breedlovehoops,2,Mon Jun 22 18:21:11 2015 UTC,If you are careful about watering it should be fine. Just know any over watering and your plants are toast.
succulents,3aqijv,AllAccessAndy,2,Mon Jun 22 19:04:31 2015 UTC,"It's not a bad base for a mix, but if you were to use it, I would cut it about 50/50 with extra perlite to make it a bit lighter. I like to have my cacti and succulents in a mix that drains well enough that I can put them outside for the summer and just let them go. We've been having a TON of rain the past couple weeks, but nothing seems too wet. With the straight Miracle gro stuff, you'd have to be more careful."
succulents,3aqijv,bmb222,2,Mon Jun 22 19:07:50 2015 UTC,"If you are growing in containers anything with peat is pretty useless for most plants in my experience. I have swtiched to gritty mixes that I make myself, pretty simple to do. Aged shredded wood bark for the organics (some plants like no organics), mostly pumice, and the rest as crushed granite- all of these are ran over a screen to sift out all the fines. This stuff drains amazingly fast, dries fast, and you then are able to water more frequently. My plants have been doing far better since I made the switch. I'm actually in the long process of switching my horde of plants over... wishing I had started with a gritty mix. I have heard they are able to be found in stores, not sure which ones, but there are pre-mixed gritty mixes.  I am trying out some semi-hydroponics for some of my caudiciforms, have some of the clay (ceramic?) pellets ordered. Anyone have any experience with this?"

succulents,3aqijv,Popsfortuitous,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:08:08 2015 UTC,"I would have tried to take out as much peat as I could, it has a very oxymoronic behaviour in that it's hydrophilic when wet and hydrophobic when dry. This often spells out massive water level swings inside the pot, from your mix's description I can hope it's less than 15% peat, but otherwise it's better not to use anything with peat in it, else your plants have more chance of drying out or rotting than being happy"
succulents,3aqijv,isfjheartcaffeine,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:35:59 2015 UTC,"I use it for lack of anything better that I could find at the time.

succulents,3amgrc,princeyuuri,8,Sun Jun 21 19:33:18 2015 UTC,Nope... the variegata part does though. Variegated plants lack chlorophyll in spots.

I knew the yellow meant little-no chlorophyll since the guy I bought it from was telling me about how the fully yellow pups don't make it very long without a lot of help (though I have no idea how one would help having no chlorophyll). My little dude has a tag that says Haworthia reinwardtii, so since he's got hello highlights in his leaves, he could be tagged ""Haworthia reinwardtii variegata""?

succulents,3ao5vk,Eleanor_Abernathy,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:28:10 2015 UTC,Could be too hot or too much sun. Ice plants are more frost resistant than heat resistant; frozen tundra versus sandy desert.

I've seen lots of posts for propagation and I followed a tutorial. I broke the leaves off gently and then let them callus over for a few days, I then laid them on a 1:2 mixture of potting soil and vermiculite, thinking that would be good drainage for succulents and stuck them outside on my back porch which has nice indirect sunlight. I will say that it's been super humid where I am and they got stuck out in a storm one day. Which of thee factors was wrong and how can I avoid it in the future?"
succulents,3anluw,panniculus,2,Mon Jun 22 00:01:04 2015 UTC,"Sometimes cuttings don't make it but a 100% failure rate is rare, I think. Getting stuck in one storm wouldn't have done them in. The thing that caught my eye is that you amended the soil with vermiculite, which HOLDS water. That in combination with the constant humidity and the storm probably did it."
succulents,3anluw,_britty_,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:11:47 2015 UTC,"Oh, I'm surprised about the vermiculite, I was under the impression that it was supposed to lighten the soil and help with drainage?"

succulents,3ajmkt,JustAnINFJ,2,Sat Jun 20 21:03:27 2015 UTC,I removed 6 pups from the mother plant today (2nd photo in the album shows all the pups). I hope they all survive!
succulents,3ajmkt,pixel_pepper,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:33:13 2015 UTC,"Looking good! These look like Haworthia ""Black Gem"" which are pretty tough. If those pups were shaded by the mother before, be sure to introduce them to full sun gradually, if possible. (although they look like they already get a little shade if they are Haworthia ""Black Gem"" -- those would be purplish if they had full sun)"
succulents,3ajmkt,pixel_pepper,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:33:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for all the advice! I thought it looked a lot like a Haworthia ""black gem"", but someone on this sub ID'd it as a Haworthia Hayashi. It looks similar enough to both, so I'm not really sure what this is! When I first got it, it was winter (not much sun) and I was underwatering -- and it was a darker brown color.  Once spring hit and it got more sun, it remained this vivid green color. The pups weren't shaded much by the mother before, but I'm still going to take your advice and introduce them to full sun gradually just in case."
succulents,3ajmkt,toonzayay,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:15:45 2015 UTC,"Ah, if it looks brown instead of purple in full sun, then it probably isn't Black Gem. Good luck! They look healthy to me, whatever they are :P"

succulents,3aju20,Qbuilderz,4,Sat Jun 20 22:14:41 2015 UTC,"It's pretty generic, but I love it all the same.   I am, however, curious about how I should go about watering when there is a mixture of plants. They are all pretty segregated within the pot, but I read that some plants need more water than others, and I wanna make sure I can provide for it well enough."
succulents,3aju20,mickalickahigh_licka,3,Sat Jun 20 22:15:40 2015 UTC,It is very cute! I usually water mine by filling up the top of the container  and letting that soak in and I don't water it again for about 11/2 to 2 weeks.
succulents,3aju20,cheesezombie,3,Sat Jun 20 22:45:29 2015 UTC,Love this! Awesome assortment and great planting.
succulents,3aju20,sliver1331,2,Sun Jun 21 00:37:35 2015 UTC,Looks cool! I just got a string of pearls and i'm hoping to save them bc they're not looking so hot right now. Yours are really looking awesome! Especially that one that looks like it's about to bloom! Exciting!

succulents,3ak1xi,harlotmusings,2,Sat Jun 20 23:33:17 2015 UTC,I find just keeping them moist they will generally take care of themselves
succulents,3ak1xi,mrmmmmm,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:40:05 2015 UTC,Would they do alright smooshed in the same pot like this? I think I might break them up into two different pots when they get a little older.
succulents,3ak1xi,mrmmmmm,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:44:08 2015 UTC,I've had success having them crowded. Every few years I'll break apart the root base and spread them out. You'll be fine in one pot and can easily repot when needed
succulents,3ak1xi,cuptits,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:07:03 2015 UTC,Perfect! Thanks so much for the help :)
succulents,3ak1xi,another-thing,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:32:17 2015 UTC,"when you say ""keeping them moist,"" how often should I be spritzing them?"
succulents,3ak1xi,mrmmmmm,3,Sun Jun 21 03:09:33 2015 UTC,"I mist every other day, which has yielded great results."
succulents,3ak1xi,mrmmmmm,2,Sun Jun 21 08:28:49 2015 UTC,"Just keep them from drying out. My experience is they are very resilient, if they start to shrivel, you need to water more."
succulents,3ak6sg,boonanaberrypie,3,Sun Jun 21 00:22:08 2015 UTC,We just bought one of these for a friend last week. The flowers are cool! I'm good with orchids and whatnot that's around my house but don't know a lot about succulents.  From looking at what's going on there I would say over watering. Let it completely dry out and water sparingly.  (Just a guess good luck!)
succulents,3ak6sg,SpartanJer,2,Sun Jun 21 00:35:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I will try this!"
succulents,3ak6sg,AllAccessAndy,3,Sun Jun 21 00:39:35 2015 UTC,"The soil mix that it's in looks far too dense. Echeveria can take a lot of water as long as they have good drainage. The soil mix should have a lot more ingredients like perlite, coarse sand, grit, gravel, etc in it so it's more porous. We've had close to 2 straight weeks of rain and my Echeveria are loving it, but they're in a well draining mix so the roots aren't smothered by the excess water."
succulents,3ak6sg,luciferprinciple,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:45:28 2015 UTC,Would I just make my own mix? Or is there something I could buy? Thanks for the reply! I will repot them asap!
succulents,3ajxgc,epicrobotbattle,7,Sat Jun 20 22:46:36 2015 UTC,Summer is the worst time to transplant them as they are winter growers. October would be best. -->I work at one of the largest (species wise) lithops nurseries in the US.
succulents,3ajxgc,bikesexually,3,Sun Jun 21 00:41:47 2015 UTC,Oh no!!! I'll keep that in mind for the future seeing as it's already out of its pot.
succulents,3ajxgc,cari19,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:53:25 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info. Mine keep dying 😟
succulents,3ajxgc,bikesexually,2,Tue Jun 23 23:05:36 2015 UTC,"They do that. Cut watering to half when they get squishy until October, then water normally (about an inch deep)"
succulents,3ajxgc,cari19,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:08:00 2015 UTC,Thanks. I'll do that.
succulents,3ajxgc,tuckedfexas,0,Thu Jun 25 05:52:35 2015 UTC,"Do these guys look healthy, they keep growing taller so I thought they were getting etiolated but they kept growing no matter how much sun they got."
succulents,3ajxgc,bikesexually,2,Mon Jun 22 04:34:47 2015 UTC,Yeah those look great. Sometimes they just push themselves up due to low light but sometimes for no real reason.
succulents,3ajxgc,bmb222,3,Thu Jun 25 02:06:58 2015 UTC,"That is a very tiny rootstock, at least compared to the ones I've been growing. Other than that, nothing that immediately stands out as unhealthy"
succulents,3ajxgc,Pezasauris,2,Sun Jun 21 00:23:33 2015 UTC,Yeah they came in a 2 inch pot and went a lot deeper than I expected so I assume that's why the roots weren't flourishing.

succulents,3akbri,tahonte,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:30:46 2015 UTC,"That's it, thanks! Looks like it has great flowers too!"
succulents,3akbri,tahonte,2,Sun Jun 21 01:34:14 2015 UTC,It makes red broccoli. The plant that blooms looks like hell afterwards. Shoots that come off the bottom (or new plants from leaves) should be cultivated to replace the mother plant.
succulents,3akbri,luciferprinciple,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:08:29 2015 UTC,"Oh seriously? That's a bummer.. I just trimmed the flowers off mine, the flower looked dead but the plant looks the same. Am I to expect a flurry of offsets soon followed by a decline in the mother plant?"
succulents,3akbri,tahonte,1 point,Sun Jun 21 07:06:39 2015 UTC,"No, it isn't like a Bromeliad. It's more like a Kalanchoe."
succulents,3aka7h,LuminousLynx,3,Sun Jun 21 00:58:07 2015 UTC,I returned a plant I bought at Home Depot when I discovered that tag.  I don't want neonics in my soil/plants.  But there are lots of people who have read the same research I have and don't have a problem with them.
succulents,3aka7h,WeavesByNightAndDay,2,Sun Jun 21 01:32:24 2015 UTC,"You can't actually buy any plants there safely.  Lowe's just agreed to phase them out, but over the next year or so?"
succulents,3aka7h,FunkyTreasureHunter,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:48:59 2015 UTC,I've stopped shopping for plants at box stores for now.  I'm glad that Home Depot is labeling so people will have that knowledge and glad Lowe's is phasing them out although I wish it was happening quicker.  I'm really fortunate to have several local nurseries in my town that are neonicotinoid free.
succulents,3aj2ja,smokesinquantity,3,Sat Jun 20 18:00:08 2015 UTC,"They definitely don't look too bad, they have pretty good coloration on top and the sides are not very green. They are also in the right stage of growth. Next should be the flower buds (if treated right and old enough) and the new leaf pair(s). If the plants start tilting even more (look at the one on the right) and elongating and turning more green, give them more light."
succulents,3aj2ja,wandering_meatloaf,2,Sat Jun 20 23:02:41 2015 UTC,"The sides are decently green, the angle isn't captured in the picture. And I'm giving them the most light I can with the situation provided."
succulents,3aj2ja,Popsfortuitous,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:32:54 2015 UTC,"about how long have you had them? I suppose sometime in july they'll be exiting their dormancy ( they enter in june usually ). As long as you keep the watering regular and at low amounts you should be fine. Although I would test that soil for drainage, and maybe put it in a terra-cotta or clay pot. Water runs down the insides of plastic pots once it gets there, rather than sticking/being absorbed. If you have good drainage/ good drain holes though I would say these Lithops look happy."
succulents,3aj2ja,bmb222,2,Sat Jun 20 21:28:31 2015 UTC,"Seconded for terra-cotta. Preferrably a small pot. I have mine planted in like 60% pumice 30% crushed granite and 10% aged shredded bark. It will live a lot longer if you ditch the small-particulate peat its in. Even 100% pumice should be good so long as it gets some fertilizer for nutrients. Peat moss as the organic medium will probably kill it, unless you are extremely careful and sparing with watering. What I do know is during the period where they are growing new leaves, they need absolutely no water, and this goes on for several months."
succulents,3aj2ja,Popsfortuitous,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:26:38 2015 UTC,Pencil sized drainage homes in the bottoms. Soil drains quite week.
succulents,3aj2ja,fingerninja,2,Sun Jun 21 00:33:53 2015 UTC,"seconding bmb: get it in some more well draining soil ( his mix sounds good ). Drain holes seem a good size but without the soil draining well they aren't doing much. Make sure to screen out most organic matter from the new soil, and make sure the roots and soil are dry when repotting. Helps them heal any damage and also not to rot. Lithops grow a tap root, so they like deeper rather than wider pots. This is especially important when you consider what standing water could do. Overall though they seem healthy, but follow these steps and they'll be even happier."

succulents,3ai5rj,effgee,2,Sat Jun 20 17:32:21 2015 UTC,"That is beautiful!  I love succulents but I tend to shy away from them because I don't like the way they tend to be arranged in an array of individual pots. It just looks so barren. I grew up in a very rain deprived climate and now that I moved, I love the look of a lush full garden. This is the best of both worlds! Lush, full display but with succulents! Love it!"

succulents,3ajlbj,tuckedfexas,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:09:10 2015 UTC,Just wait until the soil is dry about an inch below the surface before watering again.

succulents,3aiqcn,kitkatkal87,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:07:24 2015 UTC,"Very nice. Although you need to leave more room for them to grow. I did, and sometimes still do, do the same thing. You'll have to trim them (use the trimmings for new plants) in less than a year. And dont overwater. I killed tons, when I first started out, that way."
succulents,3aiqcn,JaseKian,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:44:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was thinking I might have done that. Should I remove one or two to make room, or just trim them when they get too large? And definitely, I'll water them only once the soil dries out. Thank you for the help!"
succulents,3aiqcn,JaseKian,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:31:13 2015 UTC,"If you just planted them and they haven't had time to root  I would take a few out. Plus, you can make more planted containers. 😁"
succulents,3aiqcn,JaseKian,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:45:32 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'll do that. I have a few spare containers too, thank goodness. :)"
succulents,3aiqcn,JaseKian,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:55:53 2015 UTC,In the third picture with the three plants...the one all the way on the left...that one gets big and reproduces lots of babies around the base. You can leave it and just take off babies as it gets bigger but eventually..within a year...it will he too big for that container.
succulents,3aio6r,Lameguy-eric,3,Sat Jun 20 15:46:15 2015 UTC,"The water will cause rot and eventually kill your plant. If the tips of the leaves are brown and dry, it can be a sign that it needs more water. Water the dirt and avoid the leaves.   Some succulents grow very slowly whiles others are fast growers. Look into species that tend to stay small. Lithops stay pretty small."
succulents,3aio6r,isfjheartcaffeine,3,Sat Jun 20 16:40:06 2015 UTC,"The ones you have will all eventually grow to the point of needing larger pots. However, they're all easy to propagate and you could start over with a cutting or pup to keep them in the same size containers in your apartment and have some to give away to friends.  Getting water on the leaves isn't harmful as long as they don't stay wet. All three of these plants like to get almost completely dried out between waterings or else they can be prone to rot. People are often confused on what ""overwatering"" of succulents means and will sprinkle tiny volumes of water around the plants every few days. Correct watering is giving the soil a thorough soaking until a little starts to drain from the bottom of the pot and then let the soil dry for several days or possibly weeks in between."
succulents,3aio6r,AllAccessAndy,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:52:05 2015 UTC,"So for my sempervivum, when is it safe to cut off the offsets? And how do I remove them without killing them? My sempervivum is in a tiny pot so the offsets are hanging over the edge of the pot, so I'm afraid they won't be able to form roots before I can remove them. Should I just put the hen and chicks in a bigger pot first?"
succulents,3aio6r,AllAccessAndy,2,Sun Jun 21 00:05:16 2015 UTC,"""Sempervivum"" basically means ""always living"" in Latin. They're pretty much unkillable unless you're really trying. The last couple weekends I've worked on some improvements to my rock garden that has a few Sempervivum varieties in it. I've ripped them out, tossed them around, stepped on them, and crammed them back into new spots where I want them to grow and have yet to have one die. They're a little damaged, but they'll grow out of it pretty quickly.  You can basically pull the pups off whenever. The larger they are, the better head start they'll have, but unless they're tiny you won't kill them. They also don't need roots before you remove them. Once removed, they'll grow some. Just set the pup on the surface of a new pot and it will root in within a few weeks."

succulents,3af0hl,BeneathTheCrypts,3,Fri Jun 19 16:26:38 2015 UTC,"If you got it at Lowe's then it's definitely an over watering problem. I work at a big box store, and watering is indiscriminate which is unfortunate for a lot of our succulents. Not sure if it's already on the verge of rot, but I'd definitely set it out in the sun for a bit and let the soil dry out. If you can manage it (because of the size of the pot), try only watering the soil and not the rosette once the soil completely dries out. What kind of soil is it in? Not sure how Lowe's pots these things, but get a well draining cacti soil if you can. My succulents love it."
succulents,3af0hl,isfjheartcaffeine,3,Fri Jun 19 18:02:30 2015 UTC,"Those look like offsets to me instead of flowers. You got seven plants for the price of one! I agree with BeneathTheCrypts. Let your plant dry out for a few days. If I was in your shoes, I'd replant it in a bigger pot with proper succulent soil mix and cut off a few offsets and give them their own pots."

succulents,3af0hl,cheesezombie,2,Mon Jun 22 02:58:45 2015 UTC,"Yep, I've gotten a bunch from Lowe's and clearly they do some kind of mass watering. I see a lot of their selection suffer and die that way.  Looks like over watering; was the soil damp to the touch when you adopted it?  It's not a goner - repot it in totally dry soil and be sure it's soil that drains really well. If it's a potting mix, toss in perlite (available for a few bucks at Lowe's and and elsewhere), gravel or coarse sand. Just something that keeps soil from retaining moisture. Make sure your pot drains.  Then let it sit tight for a while and after a couple weeks, touch base and see how it's doing. A few I've gotten from there were much the same, but I let them dry out, rented and they're on the mend."

It is most likely salts. Not really a problem, unless there is also a build up in the soil, which is part of what well draining soil and terracotta pots help prevent.  Just scrub it off with a brush."
succulents,3afma7,emperor000,2,Fri Jun 19 19:17:50 2015 UTC,"I added the (?) because I wasn't sure. I've literally only ever had a succulent one other time before and it was much smaller and in a homemade clay pot. I had no idea that these supposed salts built up on the outside of the pots.  edit: yes, I have touched it (the stuff and the pot). The pot itself is very cold.

succulents,3afma7,gawdawful,6,Fri Jun 19 20:21:04 2015 UTC,"If you scrape off the fuzz, it will turn to a powder very much like cement. Dry as dry can be. What happens is that the pot gets wet, and the water travels through the clay, taking minerals and salts (especially from fertilizers) with it. The water evaporates, leaving behind the minerals. These compounds have charges, positive and negative. Each molecule lines up, +-+-+-+- etc. This allows them to have more than 2 dimensions. OP can see this if OP scrapes them off and rubs the crystals between the thumb and forefinger."

I also have at least 4 very mature Ponytail palms. How long do these ""last""?.   One has two ""heads"" starting about 5 feet above the ground. i have another Ponytail palm that is pot ""bound"" and an identical plant from the same seed germination in 1987 is at least 2-3 feet higher since being planted in the ground in 2010. I am definitely planning to plant the potted ponytail in the ground in the next week or so. I have a third that was very mature in 1989 and needed a huge pot by the time I moved to Florida and planted it in the ground. It is more than 10 ft high after being planted in 2010. There were two that were identical in height, caudex, etc. in 2010 when I moved here. The one I planted in the ground has grown exponentially compared to the one that remains in the pot which has grown remarkably compared to when it was in the cold north.   If anyone is interested, would quite willingly post photos!      How long to Pony Tail palms last ... years/size/etc.  None of them has ever bloomed that I am aware of.

succulents,3ac8bt,ErosAscending,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:58:55 2015 UTC,"I am guessing that most of them are opuntia species likely bunny ears and the spines are wicked awful.

This dyeing and painting of plants should be discouraged but I guess it is whatever sells to the ignorant masses so this will probably increase and saturate the plant market in many locales where intelligent life is rare! Plant painting is likely to greatly shorten the life of the plant. Dyeing the spines ... probably not overtly harmful to the plant but why do it to Opuntia which are the most ""offensive cacti"" possible expecially for the novice or first time cactus buyer. Stupid question ... they grow like weeds and are easy and cheap to produce in large quantities.  I live in Florida where cacti can exist in the yard. If I found an opuntia growing on my property, it would immediately become a scientific experiment to see how fast roundup will kill it."

You have to keep them pretty close, but be careful of scorching your plants.  If you're looking for even more power (above 100W total), look into T5HO and PL-55 based systems.

succulents,3a8cnu,EatsButt,10,Thu Jun 18 00:57:35 2015 UTC,"What did you plant? Some succulents, like sempervivum, are 'alpine' succulents. Love bright light, can take freezing and snow, but can't really take high heat as well. Sedum can be the same way, as well as some echeveria. (Also, there are a shit ton of variations in heat tolerance in various species.) Among common types, aloe, agave, cactus, crassula, & way more would do better in high heat.  But, you also need to harden plants off to outside weather, even succulents, same way you get a sunburn if you go out all of a sudden. Gotta let them 'tan' first, adjust to the new conditions. They don't have legs, so they generally don't have to deal with giant jumps in conditions... Same with all plants really!"
succulents,3a8cnu,0rganelle,5,Thu Jun 18 02:36:56 2015 UTC,"Putting them directly out in the sun doesn't work for any succulent. If you get them used to the heat and sun, nearly any succulent that would survive here and does ok in direct light (label should say) would tolerate the sun."
succulents,3a8cnu,disneyfacts,4,Thu Jun 18 09:14:15 2015 UTC,Have you considered setting something up to cut direct sunlight for a few hours?

succulents,3a8cnu,offramppinup,9,Thu Jun 18 01:30:40 2015 UTC,It's a temporary thing to let them get acclimated to the sun
succulents,3a8cnu,PM_ME_UR_PLANTS,5,Thu Jun 18 05:21:58 2015 UTC,"Are they still alive? What did you plant? You should be able to do the put up/take down thing and water them a little for a couple weeks , and then have them recover. After that they'll be hardened off and any new growth should be adapted to the intense sun."
succulents,3a8cnu,potatoelauncher,3,Thu Jun 18 03:27:52 2015 UTC,"If they are getting a ton of so cal sun with temps hovering above 80 degrees + you can grow agaves, aloes, some sedum, most cacti and euphorbia.  Which part of so cal are you at?  How far inland from the coast?"
succulents,3a8cnu,emperor000,3,Thu Jun 18 05:37:31 2015 UTC,"If they don't die, they should adapt to the sun and the burn will go away. There's no reason to remove them unless they are dead.  They just didn't have time to adapt. I've done this too. This spring a lot of weaker/unestablished plants died because I put them outside while it was in the 70s and then basically the next day it hit 90 for a couple of days."
succulents,3a8cnu,ILoveMySenpai,2,Thu Jun 18 16:37:05 2015 UTC,"I live in NC, and I've recently had the same problem. Moved my plants outdoors and Sempervivum, Bear Paws, Blue Chalk Sticks and a Golden sedum all withered and died. In the same day.   Now, none of them were acclimated to the light, so there's that. We have semps outside that do well.   Also, Yucca seem to do pretty well. Ground covering Sedum like Sedum Angelina have faired alright too. I'd look up what does best in your zone and try to work with it! In my experience, cacti are much less trouble when it comes to too much sun."
succulents,3a8cnu,Popsfortuitous,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:42:28 2015 UTC,"let this be a firm yet gentle lesson, Always acclimate your plants to new conditions. I know it will be hard to do so with an entire collection, but it will be worth it and yoru plants will be happy with you  don't take plants out unless you're sure they're dead, it may be mushy to wait, but you can avoid killing a plant or two that have started to make effort to come back, as emperor000 said"
succulents,3a8cnu,BackToTheBasic,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:10:06 2015 UTC,It has more to do with getting them acclimated.  They were used to a certain environment and you've shocked them by thrusting them into another light environment.  It's going to be the same for any other plant unless they were grown in a light environment similar to what you're planting them in.
succulents,3a6qra,peachy_clean,2,Wed Jun 17 17:44:22 2015 UTC,What are your watering habits?  What kind of pot are they in?  What kind of light are they being exposed to?
succulents,3a6qra,GhettoGopher,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:16:47 2015 UTC,I'll usually wait until the topsoil feels dry before I water again because I can't really reach any further since the pot is small.  Wood.  Partial sunlight. I also live in Florida where the weather has been rather humid and hot.
succulents,3a6qra,cheesezombie,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:56:21 2015 UTC,"Does the pot have any way to drain water out or is it a solid bottom?  Especially if there are no drain holes, water will hang out at the bottom and could be rotting the roots.  Try placing them in a location with lots of sun throughout the day and only water when the soil seems totally dry. These plants love soil that drains well (cactii + succulent pitting mix is a good start - easy to find at most Home Depot, Lowe's, etc.) and mix well perlite or sand to ensure the soil doesn't retain too much water. They thrive well in non-moist, dry conditions so don't worry if you find yourself watering once every 2 weeks or so.  Agree with other poster - the plants are in need of more sun, hence why they grow tall and leaves spread apart."
succulents,3a6qra,another-thing,2,Thu Jun 18 03:41:48 2015 UTC,"Make sure you buy coarse sand- if it's too fine, it can clump up and retain water even more."
succulents,3a6qra,isfjheartcaffeine,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:17:45 2015 UTC,"I personally would re-pot each of these plants in its own terracotta pot with succulent soil mix (you can find DIY recipes online). The tall one in the back looks like it needs more light since he's stretching up like that(someone correct me if I'm wrong).   Also, you want the soil to be completely dry before watering again. One technique to seeing if you need to water or not is to have a duplicate pot with the same type of soil but no plants. Water it the same amount you water the pot with plants in it. After a week or so, you can stick your finger in all the way or dump the pot out to see if its completely dry. Then you'd know what the soil is like for your plants."
succulents,3a6qra,stardigrada,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:14:44 2015 UTC,FYI a pot with no plants in it will stay wet for longer than one with roots that are absorbing water.
succulents,3a8fwp,dollfaise,8,Thu Jun 18 01:27:24 2015 UTC,"Glass is definitely a poor choice. It's extremely hard to drill a drainage hole into glass, so I doubt these linked have holes in the bottom. The best type of pot to use would be an unglazed, terra cotta pot. If a soil is rich with perlite, pebbles on top can prevent it from flying away. However, it's mostly decorative and can trap water as well."
succulents,3a8fwp,ILoveMySenpai,2,Thu Jun 18 01:46:17 2015 UTC,"The important thing are drainage holes. Terracota pots are better (probably not the prettiest choice for a weeding favor), but if it has drainage holes, glass or plastic will work too.    For the soil mix... regular potting soil mixed with perlite/chicken grit/coarse sand will do."
succulents,3a8fwp,OrAnGu,2,Thu Jun 18 08:14:22 2015 UTC,"Those are very cute. You could just do the kit and send home instructions with the plants on how replant them in a bigger pot with the proper soil. Not everyone knows how to care for plants and even if you do gift them in the proper pot and soil, they would still die by over-watering, improper amount of sunlight, etc. And if you gift them to people who know how to care for plants, they will re-pot it in a jiffy.   If you are feeling super crafty, look into making your own pots using hypertufa. The material is perfect for succulents and you can create your own style/size of container. And from what I remember, very affordable to make yourself."
succulents,3a8fwp,isfjheartcaffeine,2,Thu Jun 18 14:03:45 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the input! I was already pretty sure that I would need to send home care info with them based on my fiance's mothers ideas alone; she insisted they are easy to care for and we could simply re-pot them in prettier plastic containers. I don't think many are going to know much more about them than she did and I'd feel awful if I sent everyone home with a gift that was going to die.   I will look into the hypertufa, thank you so much!"

I checked over the FAQ but I am just confused about this company selling them in glass...and now that I've scanned the FAQ, I am wondering what soil they are using, oh boy...

I'd keep an eye on it, make sure it doesn't get sunburnt--and make sure the water levels are appropriate, depending on how much rain you/your plant gets.  If you're in, say, Southern California where it's always 85 and sunny in the summer, it might require much more water than you're used to.  If you're in Houston and you're paddling a canoe to work, you might want to bring it in.   I have a few Aloe that I keep outside because they mope when they don't get all-day sun, and I bring them in when it's cloudy because it rains too much here for them to be happy."

Just keep it right by a window where it has constant bright light and maybe a bit of pure sun. That's generic though, sometimes it depends on the plant. Some like full sun, some like filtered. Try to ID the plant and research it specifically."

succulents,3a6vxh,kellydactyl,3,Wed Jun 17 18:19:58 2015 UTC,"It's a moon cactus. Too much water maybe, but I don't know a lot about cactus. I think you can cut above the brown part, let it scab and replant. The red part is grafted on and will fall off and die eventually. The green part can live without the red part, but not vise versa."
succulents,3a6vxh,badideakitty,2,Wed Jun 17 19:28:32 2015 UTC,Overwatered. Only water it when the soil is completely dry. You may be able to cut off the bad part and reroot it.
succulents,3a6vxh,disneyfacts,2,Wed Jun 17 19:57:24 2015 UTC,"Don't blame yourself, it was probably over-watered at the store for weeks before your brought it home.   You could cut off the base, let it callous for a few days to a week or so, then plant in dirt and cross your fingers it will root again. Or you could buy a new one. I have a couple of these and after researching learned that the lifespan is pretty short for a cactus. I'm not sure its worth the effort and time to try to bring it back to life. I was just at a nursery yesterday and they were only $2.75."
succulents,3a1xw6,Tsvetkovia,8,Tue Jun 16 16:24:42 2015 UTC,"So, I've had this guy for over three years now and I just love em.  It faithfully blooms multiple times a year (he's even bloomed while inside during winter!) and is so beautiful.  It was also my very first cactus/succulent and is responsible for my obsession with succulents.  It has ten buds (most yet for this guy) on it right now but only four have bloomed.  I still have faith in the other six, they look healthy. : )"

I bet Texas has an awesome Cactus and Succulent Society, check them out, and see if they're having any sales/shows when you're feeling interested.  You can find some cool stuff, and they're usually very reasonably priced and healthy.  Don't get me wrong, garden centers are awesome too, just wanted to give you a fun idea. : )"

Back when it bloomed for me the first time, three years ago, the cactus' body was a good bit smaller and the flower was just a big as you see here!  It was even crazier looking.

succulents,3a2v0k,cuptits,2,Tue Jun 16 20:12:19 2015 UTC,"The little green bulbous guys look like Sedum Treleasei.  The big guy is, I think, some sort of Echeveria (maybe Paloma? I haven't a clue as to the species).  The other green guys could be Sedums, but I tend to think everything is a Sedum.  I know this isn't too terribly helpful, but I hope it helps even a little bit! They're beautiful, and so are your pots!! :)"

The biggest one looks like an Echeveria ""Blue Rose"" and not entirely sure what the third is but it looks like an echeveria/sedum hybrid of some kind."
succulents,3a2v0k,zehmatt,2,Wed Jun 17 02:08:17 2015 UTC,The smallest one looks like it could be a blue giant. I agree with the previous commenter thinking it could be a hybrid.

succulents,3a43wv,cdanl2,8,Wed Jun 17 02:01:00 2015 UTC,"Looks like it might need more water, and possibly got sunburnt."
succulents,3a43wv,disneyfacts,3,Wed Jun 17 02:49:00 2015 UTC,"I'm scared to water more, because I've heard overwatering can do bad things as well.  What's interesting is that I went to an aloe farm in Curaçao, and there were thousands of aloe plants in a field, exposed to the full southern Caribbean sun all day long, and they were as green as can be.  If only I'd asked their secret."
succulents,3a43wv,disneyfacts,7,Wed Jun 17 03:22:19 2015 UTC,"They were probably used to the sun - if you had it inside for a while and suddenly put it outside, it may have gotten sunburnt. Also, you can water whenever the soil is dry."
succulents,3a43wv,emperor000,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:21:14 2015 UTC,"It might be watering... Succulents will grow better with a lot of water. They just don't want to stay wet. You have it in terracotta, and assuming your soil drains well (it looks like it would, at least better than normal potting soil) then you shouldn't really have to worry about overwatering as long as you only water when the soil is dry."
succulents,3a43wv,isfjheartcaffeine,2,Wed Jun 17 12:50:19 2015 UTC,"I've had this aloe for about three years; it used to live in a room with little light, but since moving to a new house, I've moved it into a room with high light during the winter; this summer, I've put it on the back patio where it gets 6+ hours of direct sunlight a day.  For reference, I'm in zone 7.  I've heard browning is somewhat normal in full sun due to pigmentation changes, but this being the first aloe I've ever really cared for, I'm not sure if it should be getting less light, more water, or what.  I'm a cactus fan, and don't have many true succulents; one other that I have is this Christmas Carol hybrid, which is doing fairly well in part-shade: http://imgur.com/xTJdh8G  Thanks in advance for your advice!"
succulents,3a43wv,another-thing,6,Wed Jun 17 02:04:50 2015 UTC,"I think he is getting too much direct sun. Find another place where you can reduce the amount of direct sun. For example, I have my aloe on an east facing covered porch. It gets direct morning sun till about 11 am.  Ok, I know this sounds silly, but if the plants aren't gradually introduced to direct sun after being indoors, they can get sunburned and the discoloration can last for months to years. The aloes you saw in the Caribbean were probably already acclimated to all of sunshine.  Don't be afraid to water, the aloes love to drink water. Just make sure the soil is totally dry before you water again. In the summertime, you can water once a week."
succulents,3a43wv,Popsfortuitous,3,Wed Jun 17 04:25:04 2015 UTC,"Aloes tend to like more sun than most succulents, but direct sunlight without acclimation can still cause sunburn. In my experience my aloes are exceptionally thirsty (especially A. plicatilis- mine want water pretty much every day!)."

succulents,39ztfh,EatsButt,8,Tue Jun 16 02:59:33 2015 UTC,That moss is going to retain moisture and may very well cause your succulents to rot.  It looks nice but its going to work against you.
succulents,39ztfh,acrystalmoon,2,Tue Jun 16 11:00:52 2015 UTC,"Also the ""bunny ear"" (kalanchoe) needs and tolerates a lot less water than the sedums and hens and chicks - I'd remove that."

There is a big drainage hole at the bottom of the pot. I intend to water very sparingly.""  Should I still remove it or will it be ok?"
succulents,39ztfh,acrystalmoon,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:23:36 2015 UTC,"Water very thoroughly, but only when the plants need it. Check by testing the soil with a toothpick/skewer, or by pinching the leaves to test for squishiness. The soil mix should work- it's pretty similar to what I use, which works well."
succulents,39ztfh,acrystalmoon,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:46:50 2015 UTC,"The moss will still trap moisture trying to rise out of the rocks. I'd take it out.  It would be fine with bog-dwelling plants but not succulents.  For example, I've had moss in combination with pitcher plants."
succulents,39ztfh,Seapod,3,Tue Jun 16 18:50:06 2015 UTC,"Okay.  Please understand that I am trying to learn -- I'm not trying to be stubborn or argumentative, but here is my question:  The moss you see (in the front and on the right) is the only moss in the whole planter.  I'd estimate it covers about 5-7% of the total planter. It's laid on top of the soil/pumice.  Is this still an amount of moss to be concerned about?  Thanks."
succulents,39ztfh,Seapod,2,Tue Jun 16 20:36:55 2015 UTC,"It may not cause a huge problem since its not everywhere but it will definitely retain moisture that the other plants won't like.  I'd keep an eye on the succulents for shriveled leaves or darkening stems.  If root rot sets in, you may lose some things."

succulents,3a2iid,Sedimentally,2,Tue Jun 16 18:45:15 2015 UTC,"Utah can be rough to adjust to lighting because the easiest time to adjust without dealing with intense light is also when the weather is the most unpredictably rainy/snowy (spring).  And then when it finally stops raining and snowing all the damn time, it's near or over 100 F every day until September.  Of course, this is if you live in northern Utah.  Southern Utah is easier, but I'm assuming north.  If you can, try to gradually introduce the plants whenever you have time on the weekend or maybe stick them in shade.  When I lived in Utah, I didn't even bother with outside because I had a huge window that let in enough light and allowed me to have more control over the conditions my plants were in.  /u/popsfortuitous covered signs well:  spots, discoloration, severe wilting  My personal advice, invest in sedums, stonecrops, and sempervivums and make a pretty garden.  Then you can stick those things outside and they'll be able to take the harsh winters and hot summers."
succulents,3a2iid,kallan133,2,Wed Jun 17 04:58:51 2015 UTC,Oh an outdoor garden is a great idea. I could really get into that. Plus no mowing and less water.  I like it
succulents,3a2iid,Popsfortuitous,1 point,Wed Jun 17 08:06:10 2015 UTC,"One possible thing is using shadecloth, another is bringing them out gradually, starting with periods of less intense sun, and working them up to full/partial sun over a few weeks, maybe more, whichever seems healthier for each. Signs of sunburn include colour change to lessen impact, a change in growth that amplifies the number of spines/lessens the surface area exposed to the sun, and at its worst, scarring where damage has affected the plant. The colour changes will depend on the plant, but I don't believe they would turn darker, since that would increase light and heat absorption."

Lots of petals falling off, seems like that one flower stem is brown, should I cut that part off? Anything in particular going wrong, books I've read indicate underwatering but I'm not sure how that is possible because it is in a pot without drainage and medium rocks at the bottom."
succulents,3a1ewk,AllAccessAndy,4,Tue Jun 16 14:02:12 2015 UTC,"The brown flower stalk is totally normal. Flowers are very temporary.   One thing it likely needs is more light. That's why the leaves are thinner and farther apart.  Also, as far as watering goes, symptoms of overwatering and under watering are very similar. Overwatering destroys the roots and can make plants equally ""thirsty"" looking as they no longer have a means of absorbing water. Even with rocks in the bottom of the pot, a drainage hole is necessary for almost all plants to do well longterm."
succulents,3a1ewk,Succulenta,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:07:27 2015 UTC,"you can do it sans drainage holes. But you need to be very careful not to overwater. Unglazed terracotta helps a lot too.

But this guy somehow escaped and remained in her car untouched--but roughed up-- until I found him this afternoon, under her seat.  The tiny ceramic cup that it came in was cracked, so I gutted this controller and gently repotted it.  I worked outside for 8 years working for a Parks dept, until I took a desk-job last week as an IT guy. That being the case, I'd really like to keep it by my desk at work so I don't get too stir-crazy without all that green around me, but I have a feeling that he won't make it very long in there.

succulents,3a1gvc,graffiti81,2,Tue Jun 16 16:21:29 2015 UTC,If it's on the ground or obviously in a place where it will be swept up or discarded then it is fair game in my book but if you are picking leaves or pups off plants or out of pots where they have started to grow then that is outright stealing.
succulents,3a1gvc,Kigurumix,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:06:59 2015 UTC,If you are worried about taking some leaves that are going to die or be thrown away making you a bad person then you are probably doing alright compared to the rest of us...

succulents,39z6zy,bmb222,4,Tue Jun 16 00:02:50 2015 UTC,"Cut it cleanly (pruners or razor blade) above the dead part. Let the cut callus over (2 days). Reroot in clean, fresh soil. I use half potting soil, half fine vermiculite which makes for excellent drainage. Make sure there is a drainage hole. The fluffy foliage will die back but the plant should survive."
succulents,39z6zy,shillyshally,3,Tue Jun 16 00:34:46 2015 UTC,"I was going to say the exact same thing, however, sterilize the blade first. Cut above the rotting/dead section as to not include any potentially diseased matter from which the roots will regrow.   I would go a step further and say if you really want to ensure the life of this plant, use only pearlite/pumice/crushed granite/any other sort of impermeable rock. Don't use solely impermeable rock, my preferred mixture is like 75% pumice 25% crushed granite, which I bought as chicken grit from a farm store. Take this material and run it over a screen to sift out fine particulates, I mean, no matter what potting medium you choose to use this step is critical to ensure proper drainage. I could go into the details of why if anyone is interested. I have started screening all of my potting medium for all my plants, tropical and desert, and I would highly recommend it.   Sarcocaulon do best without organic material, and in a tall, deep pot, but not wide until it is larger and older. To make up for the nutrients lacking in just pumice and granite, I use a liquid fertilizer of Fish & guano or another one I have is kelp and fish, both I got from Home Depot. I have had no problems using this method. Also I only water once a week in growth, and I add some of the above fertilizer with every round (don't know if this is best, but it has been fine so far)  With some of the more hardcore desert plants such as this, I have read several anecdotes of plants going dormant for a year or two or three only to come back after experiencing something traumatic like this. This plant grows roots very slowly, and they don't take well to being wet for any lengthy period, hence why it needs to be in screened, inorganic medium."

Also a bunch of them I just got and had to hurry to get them in soil before my carpal tunnel surgery last week. I have grand plans to drill drainage holes and lots of nice pots waiting to be used!

I think the 'feelers' on the key lime pie are actually the flowers - not the flower stalk but the actual flower. I think the tiny cactus on the right may be a fish hook cactus. The purple one in the home depot set is an echeveria 'Perle von Nurnburg', other big ones there are echeverias too. Small green one in the pot with the Chocolate soldier is a mini pine tree. The one under the stinky plant, with the rounded leaves of sedum 'Pork and beans' - looks a little like burros tail. Variegated one in the same pot is a calico kitten jade."

""Chiselled out of marble"" is the best description I have heard for them.   I don't think they need any special care though I have never grown a titanopsis.   Edit: You should look out for succulent societies close to you doing plant sales / shows. They generally have very good prices on rarer plants."
succulents,39txh0,thecakeisnotalie,2,Sun Jun 14 20:14:43 2015 UTC,The titanopsis will not tolerate over watering so its best to do a little research. I believe it has pretty strict growing/dormant periods as well.
succulents,39txh0,mellymarie1123,2,Sun Jun 14 22:30:30 2015 UTC,"Yep.. Titanopsis I'd say are slightly harder to deal with than Lithops. When they get water at the wrong time or when in too low of light conditions, they stretch quite readily, but I've never actually had one die from overwatering. Calcarea is one of the more tolerant Titanopsis. I think in general calcarea like maximal light (except maybe during the hottest days of summer), and water spring through fall, with a relatively dry period through winter. Some people withhold water during the hottest months of summer. Like most mesembs, it does better if it can cool down at night.. 80F+ nights over a period of weeks to months will not make it very happy"

succulents,39veio,emperor000,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:48:58 2015 UTC,I've read that you can use a cotton bud dipped in rubbing alcohol to wipe it away. I'm worried that it's not mealy bugs and would harm the plant.
succulents,39veio,emperor000,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:13:18 2015 UTC,It shouldn't harm the plant. Just use a dry qtip if you are worried. Manually killing them will work too. You don't really need the alcohol. If you are going to kill them with chemicals then you might as well get an insecticidal soap or something like that.

succulents,39rdri,JWGoethe,2,Sun Jun 14 00:36:16 2015 UTC,"Direct sun can cause sunburn in most kinds of succulents. I'd recommend moving them to an area where they get a healthy amount of sun, but nothing too bright. It looks like the two leaves you're propagating have already gotten a bit burnt.  Unless frost is a problem, you shouldn't need to bring them in at night.  Although the top of the soil may feel dry when you water it, there still might be moisture beneath the surface. Instead, use a toothpick or skewer to test deeper beneath the soil or lightly pinch the leaves to check if they turn soft."
succulents,39rdri,another-thing,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:02:58 2015 UTC,"I have recently become obsessed with succulents, and would appreciate your guys help and taking good care of them.

One pot was a gift of plants that are already established, and the other are basically little tiny guys that I'm trying to get going, some are cuttings from other plants. Unfortunately I've only had one cutting really get going so far.  How do they look? They need more or less Sun? Well hydrated? Thanks!!!"
succulents,39rdri,isfjheartcaffeine,2,Sun Jun 14 00:39:54 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the club. Your plants look nice! You don't have to move them in and out everyday. You could find a nice spot around your yard/house where they can get a few hours of direct sun, like an east facing spot on your porch or a windowsill. The all day direct sunlight can actually harm your plants if left out long term. For watering, give them a good soak and wait until they are completely dry before you water again. For your cuttings, you can lightly mist them every other day or so and keep them in bright but indirect light."

Too many to list, here's a photo album with most of them: http://imgur.com/a/SeOji Most succulents will sprout from leaves, some sprout better from stems (some sedums, I find). Most common method is to take a cutting and lay it on the soil and lightly mist it every couple days. I've had success with cuttings put into a plastic ziploc bag - I've had many plants sprout that way, however some did rot so you really have to watch it."

Honestly, there's probably around a hundred in my sunroom and that's not including herbs or the carnivorous plants.  Propagation tips:  That depends on the plant.  Typically it can be done by leaves but a lot of plants like Aloes can only be propagated by seed and dividing buds.  There are other methods like coring or tissue culture, but that's usually for the most hardcore of enthusiasts."

succulents,39pzld,disneyfacts,1 point,Sat Jun 13 18:31:10 2015 UTC,That particular bit got the least bit of sun.
succulents,39pzld,wandering_meatloaf,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:06:41 2015 UTC,"It doesn't sound like a watering issue, if you say there are no signs of rot/softness and mushiness. Out of everything it could be, it looks most like sunburn to me as well, since sunburned Lithops tend to bleach and lose their color.. But that is again very odd in an east-facing window.  What might have happened is   1) the plant started etiolating (you can tell due to the weird crooked growth of the plant and the green sides), and then   2) the plant started receiving a lot more light more quickly than it could get adjusted to (moving the pot around could have done this, or maybe if you recently purchased that one and it came from a badly lit situation), and then   3) sunburned.  That's my best guess though. I suppose you could also check if the pot is getting too warm, but again, in an east-facing window, it's unlikely."
succulents,39pkf3,McPandapants,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:40:33 2015 UTC,The one on the left looks like Sedum spathulifolium. It looks a bit etiolated and could do with more light.

I mist them about every other day. Now, a few days ago, it began raining. (I live in California and we have a severe drought). I put all of my cuttings outside to get rained on all day. They were soaked. After the rain shower, I noticed the roots began emerging! I don't know if the timing lined up or the rainwater helped. Either way, patience was a must."

succulents,39kazw,emperor000,2,Sat Jun 13 16:38:48 2015 UTC,"It shouldn't matter, should it? I mean, it would maybe be smarter to put them on soil because they need to be misted so soil would be less messy but there's really no reason that soil is better for propagating that anything else. I mean, the soil doesn't do anything for the sprouting leaves."
succulents,39kazw,emperor000,2,Mon Jun 15 14:36:08 2015 UTC,"Well, watering is a big part of it. They don't necessarily need to be misted.  I don't know of the exact mechanism, but soil is going to provide chemical signals to the plant, especially after it has roots, or at the very least the roots can immediately start growing into the soil.  There's just no reason to not grow them on top of soil."

succulents,39hfxc,SupraLamb,5,Thu Jun 11 19:06:36 2015 UTC,"I would definitely get a terracotta pot or two, and re-pot with a soil mixture made for succulents and cactus. There are many soil recipes available online that are cheaper and much better quality than packaged soils.  I would decapitate the taller plants. I don't know if that is the growing  pattern for that particular plant, but sometimes the succulents that do not get enough sunlight will stretch out like that."
succulents,39hfxc,isfjheartcaffeine,3,Thu Jun 11 21:37:07 2015 UTC,Custom soils are the way to go. I'd say first and foremost the most crucial thing to do is use a screen to sift out fine particles no matter what the medium is.
succulents,39hfxc,bmb222,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:57:51 2015 UTC,"This was a gift one of my coworkers received during the holidays this past year.  Does anyone have any recommendations on re-potting?

We mist with a spray bottle about once a week, but should we re-pot anyway?] Should we decapitate the taller plants? Thank you in advance for all of your advice!"
succulents,39hfxc,stuffguy1,5,Thu Jun 11 19:09:06 2015 UTC,"needs sunlight. don't use spray bottle on it, instead water the soil deeply once every two week or so during summer and one a month during winter."
succulents,39hfxc,Unspoken_Myth,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:55:08 2015 UTC,"I disagree with this. Maybe it's different based off of what plant is being watered, but I drench my plants every other day about (once the soil is bone dry) and they are absolutely thriving. I find watering weekly, especially biweekly, is most definitely not enough."
succulents,39hfxc,stuffguy1,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:33:12 2015 UTC,"All depends on many factors-indoors, outdoors, live in a humid or dry place etc. I err on the side of under watering as it is easier to save an under watered succulent than one who has root rot from over watering. All told more frequent deep waterings in a pot with good drainage in summer and less frequently in winter is a good rule of thumb"
succulents,39hfxc,sliver1331,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:59:50 2015 UTC,I do the same with my elephant bush! I was first super cautious about watering but found out he's a thirsty little guy so I water every couple of days.
succulents,39hfxc,another-thing,2,Sat Jun 13 20:56:42 2015 UTC,"Terracotta is optimal, but anything with good drainage will do. When you repot, use a blend (about 1/3 each) of perlite, pumice/fine gravel, and succulent mix. Misting doesn't really get water to the plant, which is why you need to completely soak the soil. If you did that in your current container, it would rot very quickly, so repotting is a high priority. Another concern is light- they won't get enough if they're not right next to a window."
succulents,39hfxc,emperor000,2,Fri Jun 12 09:31:04 2015 UTC,"We mist with a spray bottle about once a week, but should we re-pot anyway?   Yes, misting isn't going to give them enough water."

Edit: and thanks for the compliments btw!"
succulents,39eer8,Stormshaper,2,Thu Jun 11 05:34:15 2015 UTC,"Interesting! Does it take long for these to grow? I can imagine that it takes a while for a plant to develop such a thick trunk.

succulents,39gvth,secretagentkitty,5,Thu Jun 11 23:21:30 2015 UTC,I purchased ones with blue and red LEDs to give them the specific wavelengths that chlorophyll needs to promote photosynthesis.

I wanted something more targeted since I am using this as a supplemental light to the normal sunlight they get from along the windowsill.

succulents,39dv5u,Volkodavy,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:24:24 2015 UTC,"I bought an aloe recently that was so over-watered at the garden center that it was growing moss on the soil... seriously!!! I took it out, knocked most of the soil off the root ball and put it in some new soil I made. Placed small gravel at the bottom courtesy of my lovely driveway and then filled it up with a 50/50 mixture of cactus soil and perlite. Pulled the smallest pups and planted them to test my mixture. If this mixture is nice enough, I'll pull the biggest pup and plant that one too.  I don't have any sand ATM but once I get some, I'll pull the plants and mix in some sand.  Anybody have luck with this mixture? Surely this is better than the sopping wet general potting mix they were in before."
succulents,39dv5u,another-thing,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:26:19 2015 UTC,"Coarse sand helps with drainage, but finer sand (like play sand) tends to clump together and hold in moisture. Try mixing in fine-ish gravel or pumice."

The bottom of the leaves were seriously covered in scale. I ended up having to unpot to more effectively remove the scale with a q-tip dipped in rubbing alcohol.  A bunch of the pups fell off in the process; I'm hoping they will propagate.  I've gotten as much scale off as I can and will repeat in a few days. Any other suggestions? I don't want to give up on this guy!
succulents,3984yy,Souperhans,2,Tue Jun 9 23:14:12 2015 UTC,"There's quite a bit of scale on some of the plants where I work, we're currently doing white oil sprays to kill them and it seems to be working. You can just scrape them off too (fingernail works), make sure you get them all otherwise they will spread again.   Your plants and offsets should be fine, with perhaps the exception of that smallest one, but good luck regardless!"

It has stalks that come up and put out a cone of red flowers.  Its really pretty.  Mine did best being somewhat crowded.  It put out so many babies that it ended up being a dense half circle it kind of looked like an ice cream cone because it was just so full.  As far as I know it's not medicinal.  I wish I knew the actual name.  I only water it when the leaves are somewhat thin and I keep it in full sun.  Its such an easy plant.

succulents,397b99,makepr3tend,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:47:44 2015 UTC,"It sounds like the soil may be too dry to really soak the watering you're giving it. If you're worried you're underwatering, I would water next time by soaking the entire pot in a container so that the water you pour in the container is comes up almost all the way to the soil line of the plant. Weigh the pot in your hand to get a good idea of its dry weight then place it in the water. Leave the pot in there for 10-20 minutes and pull the pot out of the water. It should feel heavier and you should notice the soil is damp on the surface. Let it drain really well and monitor it for a few days. The soil, even well-draining, should stay damp for a few days. Are your plants all in unglazed terra cotta pots? If they are and it's warm where you are, it may be drying your plants out too much and you may want to consider gasp glazed or plastic containers."
succulents,397b99,BabuGillis,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:35:47 2015 UTC,"One is in a plastic container while another is in an unglazed terra cotta pot. I think part of the problem may be that I only water them for a few seconds at a time until the soil looks slightly damp b/c I'm too afraid of overwatering them, haha. The one in the terra cotta pot is a sempervivum and I know they're very susceptible to root rot."
succulents,397b99,BackToTheBasic,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:52:31 2015 UTC,"If the pot has a hole in the bottom and you've planted in well-draining cactus soil or mixed your own, it's ok to soak the full column of soil in the pot.  this will also encourage deep root growth, which helps the plant be more vigorous.  Good cactus soil will actually dry out a lot more quickly than regular potting soil, so a thorough watering is not a problem.  The main point with not overwatering is to have soil that drains appropriately and let the pot approach dryness before you water again, so the roots can breathe and not be sitting in muck all the time.  Also keep in mind that in large pots if the top inch is pretty dry it doesn't mean the bottom half of the pot is.  So adjust your H20 appropriately.  You just don't want it to be dripping wet and constantly re-wetted before it has a chance to air out.  Some plants with really fat leaves can also swell with too many water feedings and damage the plant.  Overall it's hard to mess up, just listen to your plants and learn."
succulents,395iin,anysize,3,Tue Jun 9 12:02:58 2015 UTC,"Interesting question. I'm not sure. Like you, my plants are also in TC pots with the base of the plant at the level of the rim of the pot. If I plant the lower, the bottom of the plant wouldn't get enough sunlight (mine all live indoors along windowsills and need all the help they can get!)."
succulents,395iin,secretagentkitty,2,Tue Jun 9 14:29:21 2015 UTC,A lot of small greenhouses have them in terracotta pots with sand or small stones as the top inch or so. I'm not sure if they receive them that way or what but if they do your place could have just removed them. Its also easier to water the plant when the soil isn't flush with the rim so mine are usually inset about a half inch.

succulents,394cbq,doablysad,4,Tue Jun 9 04:11:26 2015 UTC,"It looks like over watering caused the trunk to rot. Are those crystal polymer granules in the soil? They're included in a lot of houseplant ""moisture control” soil mixes.   I had a sempervivum that went from perfect to dead in a day from rot when I didn't let it callous for long enough before planting. The green leaves and the middle green stem are salvageable though, so that's a plus."
succulents,394cbq,picklejinx,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:11:58 2015 UTC,those are not crystal polymer granules.    I'm unsure about it being overwatered.  the pot is always dry and light before I water it again.  why wouldn't it affect the others in the same pot?   sorry about your semp. :(
succulents,394cbq,Onixshard,2,Tue Jun 9 07:00:19 2015 UTC,Yeah I can see they are plastic beads.   There could of been a pocket of water that affected the root system for the one that rotted.
succulents,394cbq,emperor000,0,Tue Jun 9 10:19:45 2015 UTC,those are glass beads and they're definitely not mixed throughout the soil.  I would not put plastic near something I watered.
succulents,394cbq,samisaw2,3,Tue Jun 9 18:21:59 2015 UTC,It probably has to do with the beads and rocks over your soil preventing the soil from drying as quickly as it would otherwise.
succulents,394cbq,emperor000,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:22:35 2015 UTC,"Yes, these materials are acting as a mulch and also keeping the soil cool. You want a well drained, sandy soil with no mulch cover. You probably have water log. Hopefully removing some of the cover will help the soil warm up and dry out a bit. If that doesn't help then let us know again. The only other thing I can think of is some sort of insect eating the roots"
succulents,394cbq,emperor000,4,Tue Jun 9 14:40:07 2015 UTC,The soil doesn't really need to be sandy... That might encourage people to add sand to potting soil which doesn't turn out well.
succulents,394cbq,emperor000,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:50:47 2015 UTC,maybe. it's completely dry under it tho.
succulents,394cbq,emperor000,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:17:58 2015 UTC,"Now, but the rocks will still trap moisture longer than if they weren't there."
succulents,394cbq,emperor000,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:57:20 2015 UTC,hmm true.  I don't think I can remove them tho.  it's quite windy here and I have dust allergies.  it really is just a sprinkle and not heavy/mixed.
succulents,394cbq,havinabadtime,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:57:37 2015 UTC,What do you mean windy and dust allergies?
succulents,394cbq,havinabadtime,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:28:03 2015 UTC,it's really windy where I live and any sort of kick up from dust or dirt has me in an allergy fit.  it's pretty bad.    the other option would to just keep them outside at all times but scared of small children or bugs disturbing them
succulents,394cbq,BabuGillis,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:10:52 2015 UTC,"They don't live outside? That is the other part of your problem, then. Bugs shouldn't be a problem. That's more likely inside. I don't know about small children."

succulents,393kk8,real_lame,2,Tue Jun 9 00:40:51 2015 UTC,Looks like sedum tetractinum.
succulents,393kk8,Marisyn,2,Tue Jun 9 02:28:17 2015 UTC,Sedum!
succulents,393kk8,secretagentkitty,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:35:53 2015 UTC,"I have one of these too, but I can't find an ID anywhere in the googles. My guess is that it's a type of Sedum based on how quickly it puts down roots along its stems. I have a whole bowl of cuttings rooting in water right now."
succulents,393kk8,picklejinx,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:28:46 2015 UTC,Most likely sedum. If I'm not mistaken these ones are hardy.

succulents,39334b,quizzicalquow,3,Tue Jun 9 02:18:12 2015 UTC,"Ouch, usually they pull of pretty easy, if it's just on the needles it shouldn't hurt to trim the needles. If you damage the top a little it should be able to scar over, just don't water the wound while its open : ) good luck!"

succulents,391e0p,makepr3tend,2,Mon Jun 8 15:23:53 2015 UTC,Definitely a sempervivum - too early to tell officially whether it's jovibarba or not. Super cute though!
succulents,391e0p,cheesezombie,2,Mon Jun 8 18:37:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks! It was a gift (: I think it's most likely a sempervivum but we'll see by this time next year at the latest, haha. I love both semps and jovis but I still prefer echeverias b/c they're not monocarpic"

succulents,391xpa,bario10444,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:38:23 2015 UTC,That's beautiful.  I've been looking for one for so long.  Nowhere in my area carries it.  I am so tempted to order one online but then the search would be over and I wouldn't have an excuse to stalk the garden section and nurseries.
succulents,391xpa,havinabadtime,2,Mon Jun 8 21:45:33 2015 UTC,"When I can't find a plant I want, I just ask the nursery if they can get it for me - they usually can, though sometimes it's a bit of a wait."
succulents,391xpa,anysize,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:59:06 2015 UTC,That is a great idea!!  I will ask next time I'm browsing.  The search is half the fun.  It makes a nice memory!

succulents,391xpa,glemstone,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:33:36 2015 UTC,"It does help, I'll keep checking back!  Thank you! The two lowes and home depots keep running out of succulents or have the same ones over and over when I drop in.  I can't find a pencil cactus or zigzag anywhere either.  I'm sure eventually I will.  I had them about 4 years ago but we had to move and they didn't make it.  Now that we live in a warmer climate again and I have windows for them to have during the winter I'm slowly rebuilding the ones I had and really enjoyed.  One that's new to me and has been a whole lot of fun is donkeys tail.  It is growing so fast and every time it drops a leaf it makes a new one with no effort.  It's a cool plant."
succulents,391xpa,havinabadtime,2,Tue Jun 9 02:05:23 2015 UTC,"No problem! They didn't have them on the shelves with the rest of them, but hanging near it if that helps!! I'd do what the other person said and ask about it. They can probably order it for you if they're still receiving them. That sucks your other ones didn't make it. I've pretty much abused one of mine for the past forever (not water, low light, etc) and it's been pretty resilient. Also check your local nurseries. I also saw some there; they were a little pricier but usually looked healthier. Oh, and none of the other ones had that dumb hot glued flower lol"
succulents,391xpa,glemstone,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:50:31 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for the information.  I'm going to check it out again this weekend!  I agree nursery plants are so much healthier.

succulents,38zmzi,AllAccessAndy,3,Mon Jun 8 05:53:21 2015 UTC,"yup, they usually market it as coral cactus but it's actually a grafting of two kinds, I think there's another post on this board that states what species they both are."
succulents,38zmzi,bw1870,3,Mon Jun 8 08:32:10 2015 UTC,"The tags at Lowes say ""coral cactus, Rhipsalis whatever species"", but it's actually a crested Euphorbia lactea grafted onto another Euphorbia, not a true cactus at all."
succulents,38zmzi,gelmo,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:45:15 2015 UTC,What is the reason for grafting like this?
succulents,38zmzi,persiphone,2,Mon Jun 8 13:47:07 2015 UTC,"They take something with super robust root structure for the bottom, and graft on a slower-growing species or something like a moon cactus that literally could not grow on its own. That lets the top cactus take advantage of the kickass roots."
succulents,391g4a,shmee256,3,Mon Jun 8 15:38:46 2015 UTC,"Lots of chopping, pulling up, and repoting to make it fresh will do the trick. If you get extra pots and soil, you'll end up with several extra plants out of this. Ask away if you have questions about how to propagate, but basically you'll be propagating back into this pot, and into others if you wish.  If you get nice, healthy plants out of the propagation, you can probably sell them or make nice gifts out of them. People will pay/appreciate more for a plant they don't have to ""save"" immediately after getting it."
succulents,391g4a,PM_ME_UR_PLANTS,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:00:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks, you guys are so helpful in this sub!   I do have a few questions about propagation actually.   the light green droopy one: should I propagate just with the leaves, or break off the little mini rosettes that are forming? ooor, should I bury the roots that have sprouted from the stems? the silver/green/pink one: another person mentioned I can decapitate it. Should I try that or propagate from leaf?"
succulents,391g4a,PM_ME_UR_PLANTS,3,Mon Jun 8 17:09:39 2015 UTC,"I suggest the decapitation/stem method for a first go at it. It's easier, and gives you a larger, more hardy plant right away (though less of them). It also will preserve variegation on variegated varieties, though that doesn't matter in this case.   When pulling off leaves to get the stem cuttings going, you'll end up with some leaves to experiment with leaf propagation, and can still give it a try.  Here's my favorite guide for that: http://needlesandleaves.net/blog/2013/5/31/propagating-leggy-succulents  For stems as long as yours, you can also try leaving a couple leaves on middle chunks of stem, and rooting them with from cuts both above and below. I haven't tried that myself, but I think /u/goddonut has.  That guide applies to the overgrown ones except for the haworthia, for which you just pull apart the pups."
succulents,391g4a,GodDonut,2,Mon Jun 8 17:20:02 2015 UTC,Great link! Thanks so much!
succulents,391g4a,GodDonut,2,Mon Jun 8 17:33:31 2015 UTC,"Yep, decapitation works really well. I didn't leave any leaves on middle stem cuttings like he suggested, I tried to replant them as bare stems and that didn't work. However, the top 6"" of the plant I repotted and is growing nicely, there's a teeny tiny plant growing out the old stem (the original, rooted stem), and I have 50+ new plants growing just from old leaves :D"
succulents,391g4a,EllietheWalrus,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:32:15 2015 UTC,Wow that's awesome!  So you kept 6 inches off the top of the plant? How many 'layers' of leaves did you leave?
succulents,391g4a,EllietheWalrus,2,Mon Jun 8 18:36:57 2015 UTC,"Well the top few inches is a very tight rosette of many leaves, but the I left probably 3-4"" of widely spaced leaves from the etiolated section of the stem. If I could do it again, I would get less stem, but I was very worried about killing it, because Charlie is my favorite plant. I would leave probably 2"" of the stem instead so that he is planted firmly while waiting for new roots to grow, but also not too tall."

succulents,390gdt,doablysad,1 point,Mon Jun 8 10:07:00 2015 UTC,"In my experience, spider mites typically have webs closer to the nook between stems, branches, and around leaves.  I think this is just a regular spider.  You could try removing the web and see how often it comes back.  Spider mite webs will come back no matter how many times you remove webbing, whereas regular spiders give up after a few days.  You can also see spiders with the naked eye.  Spider mites are harder to see and usually require a magnifying glass or a loupe for most people to visualize.  Also, look at the leaves.  Any discoloration or deformities?"
succulents,390gdt,kallan133,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:20:42 2015 UTC,I think I'd be ok with a spider cause I've been having problems with those white fuzzy bugs. might keep it there and see what shows up.   there are tons of brown spots on my bear paws but I can't see any pests.

Yeah the bag-method seems to be common, personally I used those mini greenhouses with peat pots (not my picture, random internet). Same difference though, high humidity!

succulents,38yxzt,PM_ME_UR_PLANTS,2,Mon Jun 8 01:40:15 2015 UTC,"Would you say this is a Sempervivum? I read that that type grows a long stalk that blooms right before it dies, which would be disappointing since I just got it lol"
succulents,38yxzt,RegularOwl,3,Mon Jun 8 02:09:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is sempervivum. It's hard to know the species for certain without more light to bring out accent colors.  The rosette with the bloom will die (the hen). The surrounding rosettes (pups when referring to them for succulents in general, or chicks in the case of this plant) will live, and may eventually put out more pups and bloom themselves.  This plant does however tend to do the best outdoors with lots of direct sun and very good drainage. It's adapted to grow in rocky cracks in the Alps where it gets intense sun, huge temperature swings, and water it encounters flows by rapidly.  Echeveria breeds can look similar and do better indoors on bright window sills."

succulents,38xfir,doablysad,2,Sun Jun 7 18:18:51 2015 UTC,I think it is an ariocarpus retusus (the label was not clear).  I like them too. That one was just impressive because it was so large.

succulents,38xmrb,Popsfortuitous,3,Sun Jun 7 20:45:58 2015 UTC,"definitely won't be an instant rejuvenation but if it looks like the wrinkles have evened out over the next few days, that amount of water will have done it. I've heard lithops are quite fussy with their watering, so make sure next time you water the soil is dry an inch or two down. I've heard that's somewhat of a general rule with most succulents.  ( reading up however its really important that if you just got the plant you make sure the soil isn't full of peat and bark, lithops do like a VERY well draining mix, and its easy to over water with anything over a tablespoon. It would really help to have someone more experienced answer here, I don't have much experience with living stone. ) ( if your soil mixture is way too absorbent, it would be best for you to let it out of that soil, pot it in a looser mix, and let it acclimate for a while to strengthen the roots. They like to absorb what water is around them )"
succulents,38xmrb,Popsfortuitous,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:00:07 2015 UTC,I hope they'll stick around for you without too much of a problem. Lithops have been known to die off spectacularly for a lot of people.

That way you can put it anywhere and not have to constantly worry about overcrowding or over watering.  Its not impossible to house succulents in a bowl like that, it just will be tricky because the lack of drainage and you wanting the succulents to grow very slowly.  Some of the artificial ones look really life-like and you could mix and match any kind in it without worrying about anything."
succulents,38xx9w,havinabadtime,2,Sun Jun 7 20:18:45 2015 UTC,"I would not put any succulents in that. It would make a nice bowl for a betta, and you could put a lot of live plants in in that grow in and out of the water. Something like this"

succulents,38xx9w,tuckedfexas,11,Sun Jun 7 20:04:07 2015 UTC,"I would worry about watering needs more so than growth. I would advise against this for succulents. There's tons of pictures of people putting succulents in them but they don't usually last long unless you are very careful with their watering. The problem is there is no drainage at the bottom, and the bowl will trap additional humidity. These are both bad environment for succulents as rot comes without proper drainage.   I've tried drilling holes in similar glass bowls, but even with the proper tools, it's very difficult. Just something to think about."

succulents,38wi7s,doablysad,2,Sun Jun 7 12:43:11 2015 UTC,perhaps he meant slowly introducing them to direct sun to avoid things like sunburn? they can take full sun but I've noticed if they were in a shady spot previously.  they'd get sunburnt if put in direct sun right away.    also if your glass terrarium doesn't have drainage holes and plants start to show some signs of wear or rot.

succulents,38v8vb,Popsfortuitous,1 point,Sun Jun 7 11:49:49 2015 UTC,Awesome! I'd been on the hunt for a small crown of thorns for so long and lucked into finding a place with great selection! Most places I'd seen them only had big ones. I hope I'm not the only person who enjoys buying small plants and watching them grow!

succulents,38wvh5,Unspoken_Myth,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:57:56 2015 UTC,when they said plant it deeper.  I'm sure they didn't mean to break the plant from its roots.  what I would do is take the whole plant out.  remove the dead leaves.  let the plant dry out for 1-2 weeks.    repot in a bigger pot with better draining soil cause it might have been overwatered or the soil is not well draining.  or it might even be the pot doesn't have holes? I can't really tell.  if you can change some things so that it won't happen again.
succulents,38wvh5,doablysad,2,Sun Jun 7 18:28:28 2015 UTC,Before I was way under watering it which is why so many leaves died. I'm watering it correctly now.
succulents,38wu7x,snakeskinny,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:45:54 2015 UTC,"For some reason it didn't add my text post when I posted this and I'm on my phone so I can't fix it, sorry. I took these Jade cuttings (and others not shown) last year from a beautiful older plant of my mothers. I let them dry and rooted them with hormone and planted them in a homemade mixture of rich soil and beach sand that I cleaned.  They're healthy and sturdy and seem stable. I've noticed some nice reddening as the spring and summer sun touches them and a little bit of new leaf growth at the joints but other than that no change really. I am wondering, should I repot these with fresh soil and sand for nutrients or just use a liquid fertilizer? Thank you!"
succulents,38wu7x,doablysad,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:51:23 2015 UTC,"sand is usually bad and makes the soil dense and traps water in the soil and can create rot in the roots.  how do the roots look for your cuttings?  if you wanted to repot them in new fertilized soil that's good.  the other option are those fertilizing foams or sprays specially for succulents.  or you could take normal fertilizer beads for succulents and mix them in water (to make a light fertilizer) and spray your plants with that once a month.     otherwise, they look good! I've learned succulents grow really slowly.  like really... some are faster than others but they're teaching me a lot about patience."

succulents,38veg7,ToxicPink,3,Sun Jun 7 12:25:06 2015 UTC,"Squirrels are also greedy. More food. More squirrels. So that idea won't work, unless we are trying to distract the cat."
succulents,38veg7,Sandwichamacallit,3,Sun Jun 7 12:57:35 2015 UTC,"I have a cat who must've gotten a terrifying reputation amongst the neighbourhood rodents because they don't dare come close to the house anymore. They gnaw on stuff in the yard, but nothing on the deck gets touched.  And the cat herself has remarkably no interest in the succulents. I think because they don't really smell like much, and because she gets plenty of grass outside.  So I would second that recommendation."

succulents,38vc1v,nabubo,3,Sun Jun 7 03:31:22 2015 UTC,"The first plant looks like a species of Corpuscularia. I would guess Corpuscularia Lehmannii. It is in the same family as Pleiospilos, and it confused me too when I first saw that genus.   My guess for your second plant would be Graptosedum 'Alpen Glow'.  The third plant looks Anacampseros, but, as with all of the above, I am merely guessing."
succulents,38vc1v,superfalsenipple,2,Sun Jun 7 11:14:10 2015 UTC,"Oooh, Corpuscularia Lehmannii looks exactly like it! Thanks! I think you're correct about the Alpenglow, too. Someone else suggested the third one is a Sempervivum, and I found some images that seem really close to what I have. I'll look up Anacampseros too, though.   Really, thanks for IDing that first one. I was getting pretty confused!"
succulents,38vc1v,GodDonut,2,Sun Jun 7 11:30:40 2015 UTC,"This is my noob knowledge, and barely specific.   Top-some kind of crassula? Middle- some kind of stonecrop. Bottom- some kind of sempervivum (hen+chicks)"

Googling ""shrek's ears succulent"" got me somewhere, but no combination of ""looks like a pinecone succulent"" was helping!"
succulents,38vc1v,BackToTheBasic,2,Sun Jun 7 05:52:04 2015 UTC,Maybe someone will have more definitive ID's.  Pleisopilos?  Graptoveria Gilva?  Sempervivum.  Looks more like Dudleya than Echevieria to me (possibly D. Brittonni)
succulents,38vc1v,Popsfortuitous,1 point,Sun Jun 7 04:07:10 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I think you're right about the Graptoveria, Sempervivum, and D.Brittonni, at least from comparing to google images.   In some ways the top one really does look like Pleisopilos, but the leaves seem more numerous and stalk-y than the pictures I'm pulling up. Hmmm. I saw a pic of Lapidaria Margaretae, which also has some similarities but is not the same. Really my main concern is figuring out if its water needs are significantly different than the Dudleya and gollum jade that it's next to."
succulents,38vc1v,cheesezombie,2,Sun Jun 7 05:50:25 2015 UTC,"I think your hunch about different watering needs is likely right.  If in doubt, I would care for it like Pleisopilos and other related plants."
succulents,38vc1v,BackToTheBasic,1 point,Sun Jun 7 06:04:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the more I'm looking at different Pleisopilos, the more I'm thinking you're correct. I'm going to do some more research, but as far as you know, is Pleisopilos kind of like lithops? As in, you water only when it's beginning to wrinkle? (Not that I've ever cared for a lithops, I've just read more about them.)  Edit: Actually, as I research Dudleya, it seems like its water needs are quite low, too. Like, maybe it's looking droopy because I watered it at all in the summer. Maybe it's the gollum jade I need to move out!"

succulents,38uylt,2354,2,Sun Jun 7 01:25:07 2015 UTC,"I strongly suggest separating those plants. 3/4 have very specific watering requirements and are known to be finicky. Your baby toes, split rock, and lithops will quickly rot if you aren't extremely careful. The last one, an echeveria maybe, will require much more water than the others to grow properly.   I would also research light requirements since some plants require light that would be much to much for others."

I think it's just the plant protecting more vulnerable portions of itself because it is getting all the light it needs without utilizing it's full square footage.   The new pot looks good, and if you still have contact with the student, you should try to see if it was an indoor plant before it came to live with you. If it was, then I would assume the plant is perfectly healthy, and just getting used to a life outdoors.

I understand the need to rescue these babies, but, in doing so you are supporting big box companies to spray paint and or glue on fake flowers to (probably healthy... before the BS) plants.  IMHO I would prefer to leave them as they are, dont get me wrong, I'm a big fan of a good rescue.... but actually spending cash money paper on these plants is just encouraging big box guys to keep this practice up."

Offsets can get long stalks like this, they stretch out from the mother leaves shading them until they can get the proper sunlight to grow condensed. A flower stalk would just go up and up, obnoxiously tall, and the growth even at this early stage would look different than the normal plant, although I'm not finding any good pictures of early flowers.

succulents,38o09k,Chtulhu_Cult,3,Fri Jun 5 13:27:13 2015 UTC,"Propagation : Right now I have a few bits and pieces sitting on a piece of paper in a spare room, they haven't done much since I laid them out. Should these be outside and in soil? (not buried, just laying out and getting some sun?)   It depends on what they are. Some will do better with more light, some will do just fine with less. Some will do better over soil, others will try to root on paper.   I've been using the Citrus and Cactus premix that you can get in any gardening dept, but I can see where that would get pricey...    Which mix? While you are starting out you might want to stick with something like this.   Looking into ""Al's Gritty Mix"" it seems there's NO soil involved....i'm really confused as to how anything can possibly grow with no soil.   Why does that confuse you? Plants grow into rocks in nature. They grow on trees and never touch soil. Most of the mass of a plant that isn't water comes from the air in the form of CO2, and mostly the carbon. Most of the rest of the mass is the water... Almost nothing, relatively speaking, actually comes from the soil itself.  There are obviously some other minerals/nutrients required, but succulents are usually not heavy feeders. Many of them like acidic water (or soil that makes the water acidic) to break up alkali components in the soil.  Most of them are not adapted to areas that have a lot of the kind of soil you are thinking of. It's going to be clay soils, rocky and sandy soils, and poorly composted soils. Since they tend to live in dry climates organic matter doesn't compost as quickly and they have to make due with that.  Even the cactus mix you are buying (hopefully) doesn't have a lot of composted matter. It might look like soil, but it is probably mostly uncomposted organic material.   Fertilization : Is this necessary? How often and with what?   It's not necessary, but it will help. Most succulent fertilizers are weak enough that you can feed every time you water, especially if they aren't in rich soil, which they shouldn't be. But you can also space it out if you want.   RePotting : My experience with gardening has taught me to remove a plant from the original, disposable little tray and slightly water the roots before putting them in the ground. Surely with succulents I want to simply take them out of the tray and place them into soil, correct? NO watering of the roots before placing them in dirt?   It doesn't really matter if the soil is dry when you take them out. If it isn't then they don't need to be watered. If it is, then they need water. If you damage the roots when repotting then you might want to wait but that isn't really how root rot happens. It happens from the roots staying too moist for too long. If your soil is holding too much water then root rot is a risk either way. Succulents like water just like any other plant. They can just go longer without it. Most plants don't like their roots to stay constantly wet."

succulents,38ktfc,squishysalmon,2,Thu Jun 4 21:27:34 2015 UTC,"I realize that perhaps the source I used for soil mixture, (1/4 gravel to 3/4 potting soil) was incorrect. There is a generous layer of aquarium gravel on the top, and maybe that's bad, too? If the soil mix is wrong, should I dig everything up and remix it?   I wouldn't do what you did, but you could always just see how it works.  The aquarium gravel on top and pots being glazed are going to slow down the drying, but it might not be enough to matter. The styrofoam and landscaping fabric underneath aren't really helping you except to make it so you use less soil. They could hinder the drying as well, but again, it might not be enough to matter."
succulents,38ktfc,emperor000,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:35:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the insight. I'm going to look into other ways to ""shorten"" the planters so I can easily move them around."
succulents,38ktfc,BackToTheBasic,2,Sat Jun 6 02:28:52 2015 UTC,"It looks to me like the spots and discoloration on the lower leaves may indicate the soil is too wet too long.  The Kalanchoe spots look like mold or fungal, which may indicate too much moisture.  These plants really don't like to have their roots sit in soggy soil for a period of time, that is not the conditions they've evolved for.  I'd put the Opuntia and Agave in their own pots, they both are going to want to get big.  The aloe looks healthy to me, the shriveled end is pretty typical.  There are a lot of recipes for succulent soil online, and the variations often have to do with what ingredients people have available in their area.  Perlite mixed in with potting soil are ingredients easy to find and will work.  I agree with the other poster that you can simply try what you have, but you need to be able to watch how it retains moisture over time.  You want soil that drains and breathes well.  The problem with gravel mulch on top is it's hard to monitor the soil moisture and evaluate how your soil is performing.  I've been learning that lesson myself."
succulents,38ktfc,BackToTheBasic,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:28:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info. If things are looking like the soil is too moist, I think it's probably best to dig them up and remix it before I have any casualties."

succulents,38ktfc,0rganelle,2,Sat Jun 6 19:53:21 2015 UTC,"You should check out the FAQ on the sidebar about growing succulents, it's been super helpful for me. Your soil mix sounds a bit too high in potting soil, a 50-50 perlite/gravel to soil is better. To fix this, you will have to take the plants out, remove as much soil as possible from the roots, remix it all. Gravel on top is sure cute but does trap moisture, so I wouldn't recommend it if you want to still have glazed pots. The styrofoam & fabric on the bottom is not helpful for your plants, a full pot of well draining soil is best, as the extra materials you added may actually inhibit drainage & drying.  I want to know what kind of agave that is, because I have the same one but I don't know what kind it is either!"

Anyway, one of the plants is now thriving, the other seems stable but I am still worried about.  I'm considering about removing it from the growing medium, drying it out and repotting.  It's also has a thick layer of pea-gravel mulch to keep the crown out of damp soil, and I'm considering whether that is doing more harm than good, or if the mulch needs to be thinned out."

All these plants have different dormancy cycles, so your watering schedule should be adjusted throughout the year. The reason its called a Christmas cactus is because it flowers around November-December.   Plastic pots are okay but IMO, terracotta is best. Just make sure there is adequate drainage.   I don't have experience with kalanchoe. Did you ever repot it to a bigger pot after bringing it home?   Research soil recipes that you can make yourself. Its cheaper and better than store bought mixes. Your plants may just need a better soil so they can root w/o difficulty.   Goodluck!"

Granted, the betiformis I have has yet to really come out of dormancy. It has had the absolute slowest growing leaf bud lump for over a month now. It is like 2mm long from the caudex at this point. I don't know if I should wait, water more, or give it less direct sun."
succulents,38gs8j,Needle88,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:52:22 2015 UTC,I know how you feel every time I bring a plant out of dormancy I still get excited. Plants have a acute sense of their environment when his time is right he we go off. I'm in southern California but my guess is night time temps are are still pretty low up in Oregon. I've seen fockea get bit hard by frost and sit dormmate for 4 years then out pops a vine.

succulents,38flh4,barinthus0,4,Thu Jun 4 15:52:49 2015 UTC,too little water! and maybe coupled with not being slowly introduced to light (if it was completely indoors at first).  I'd suggest deeply watering the pot 2-3 times a week only watering again when the soil is fully dry.
succulents,38flh4,doablysad,5,Wed Jun 3 23:05:18 2015 UTC,"Sunburn from being moved outside too quickly. Then going from being dehydrated to over saturated with water all in one go!  They can probably handle either condition alone, but don't keep them in the extremes.  A nice re-pot into a succulent friendly soil would help you greatly. Slowly introduce them into the sun next time! Given a few years though all that damage should heal.   One last thing. It might be from watering the plants with tap water. Let your water sit in an open cup overnight or for 24 hours so the chlorine can dissipate before watering your plants!"
succulents,38flh4,Succulenta,2,Wed Jun 3 23:17:34 2015 UTC,"I'll definitely leave the water out overnight from now on! Which soil would you recommend for re-potting? I used a cactus, palm, and citrus soil from Home Depot, but I'm totally open to other kinds. Also, what would you suggest I do to get them on the road to doing better? I put them into some shade after seeing that it was probably sun burn. And the soil is still wet from the last time I watered them, which was yesterday."
succulents,38flh4,Succulenta,2,Thu Jun 4 01:06:03 2015 UTC,"That soil is probably great. If you really want them to recover quickly I suggest planting them in an unglazed terracotta pot (regular flower pot) with some rocks in the bottom for drainage  and covering the soil with some more rocks/pebbles. Start in partial shade and eventually move them to full sun after a few days or when the leaves harden up. I'm not sure about fertilization as I'm not familiar with those plants.  Yes, even in r/succulents One might find themselves down voted for no particular reason. Reddit is a silly place."

succulents,38flh4,isfjheartcaffeine,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:23:03 2015 UTC,"I used the cactus, palms and citrus soil from Home Depot to plant them in. Is there a better kind I could get for them? Or is there a mix of soils that would work best?   I do live in Utah and during summer (June-July) temperatures around usually in the 90's and occasionally in the 100's. Would that effect what kind of soil I get?"
succulents,38flh4,barinthus0,2,Thu Jun 4 00:55:46 2015 UTC,"I have that same mix and I found it stays moist for days after watering, which is very bad for these plants. There are cactus/succulent soil recipes that you can make. I ended up using the same soil mix you have, and added perlite and chicken grit to it. It now drains a lot faster."
succulents,38flh4,secretagentkitty,2,Thu Jun 4 01:35:33 2015 UTC,"I've used the same soil from home depot to varying success. It's worked out great in unglazed terracotta and less so in plastic pots of any variety. I have added diatomaceous earth and that helped repel the local ant colonies and reduced the overall soil moisture content... but adding perlite to the soil mix would likely be overal easier and less expensive.   Now.. just checking but, are there are few holes on the bottom of that pot?"

succulents,38e8ts,xSuno,5,Wed Jun 3 17:15:07 2015 UTC,"They look great, I've tried them before, but the inability to drain makes it extremely easy to kill them from overwatering and possibly eventually through buildup of minerals from the water. If somehow at least can create a drainage hole or find a container with one already at the base it will help a lot. If you can manage that somehow, you can use like 60% screened pumice, 20% shredded aged bark, and 20% impermeable crushed rock, like granite, as the potting medium. If you can do those two things you will probably quadruple survivability of the plants.  Although, it can be done without the above, but you'll want to use distilled water and very light applications of water with a spray bottle in the growing season only. In the dormancy periods only water them lightly like monthly, and only if they look like they are going to shrivel into oblivion (they won't die this way, but obviously this cant be inclusive of EVERY species). Overwatering in this sort of container during the dormancy period will almost certainly destroy the root health, and probably the plant as well.

Its not as aesthetic or pretty, but the health it confers to the plants makes up for it in my opinion. I dont know if glass terrarium-esque containers exist, but someone could make a lot of money producing them specifically for cacti and succulents.  Personally I usually just scope out thrift stores for nice looking stuff, there are some really nice plant-pottery occasionally, and things that can have a hole put in the base  Edit: you know what, I spaced this: flat and wide bonsai pots. I hit the jackpot every so often at thrift stores having 2-4$ beautiful bonsai pottery that usually sells for way more.

succulents,38cj5x,bw1870,4,Wed Jun 3 13:56:06 2015 UTC,It definitely is not. It is probably a reused pot.

succulents,38cj5x,red_white_blue,4,Wed Jun 3 19:44:27 2015 UTC,Yup it's a jade.
succulents,38ezdo,WhitePineapple,5,Wed Jun 3 19:47:18 2015 UTC,looks like rot from being overwatered or soil that kept moist.  I agree with third.  let it sit and do not water or spray until roots grow back.  I would go as far to replace the soil if it's but a quick draining mixture.  or it might even be your pot. does it have holes? otherwise water is not draining and is stuck in the dirt causing rot even with quick draining soil.
succulents,38ezdo,doablysad,0,Wed Jun 3 21:45:36 2015 UTC,"Im using the special cactus soil. The old pot had a couple holes, I think enough to drain. I dont water more than 2 or 3 times a week, usually only once actually. Is that the right amount?"
succulents,38ezdo,persiphone,4,Thu Jun 4 11:55:20 2015 UTC,The best way is to only water once all of the soil is completely dry :) that could be anywhere from three times a week to once every two weeks.
succulents,38ezdo,thirdtimezsacharm,4,Thu Jun 4 14:38:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what the best thing to do in this situation would be, however, you can leave succulents out for a week or two (they sometimes need longer) in indirect sunlight, and they should grow roots again. Once they re-grow roots, you can plant them. It looks like they are fine from the top, so i'd like them re-grow roots.  It does look like your soil is a bit wet (I could be wrong), how often do you water these guys?"
succulents,38ezdo,thirdtimezsacharm,-1,Wed Jun 3 21:06:07 2015 UTC,I dont really keep track of watering very well but I definitely dont overwater. At least once a week no more than 2 or 3 times probably. Its cactus soil and has plenty of drainage too. So I should just leave it sitting in my garage like this and hope it grows back?
succulents,38ezdo,thirdtimezsacharm,3,Thu Jun 4 11:53:29 2015 UTC,"depending on your light conditions and temperature (is this an indoor or outdoor plant? etc) watering 2x or 3x per week is far too much. As /u/persiphone mentioned, waiting until soil is completely dry (you can stick your finger in it, or a chopsick to see if there's any moisture still in the soil) is the best way to keep things like this from happening again. Overwatering can cause root rot, pest infestations, and can kill your plant (depending on what it is and for how long the overwatering continues).  With that being said, everyone is prone to overwatering at some point, so don't feel too bad about it. Succulents are resilient plants, so they can usually come back from issues like what you've experienced if you give them some time :)"
succulents,38au3y,sashafurgang,24,Wed Jun 3 00:37:36 2015 UTC,"I kinda hate the whole stick a succulent in any container internet trend.  Sure it makes for a great pic right after, but most of the things I see people putting them in on trendy sites aren't good containers."
succulents,38au3y,WeavesByNightAndDay,5,Wed Jun 3 00:52:51 2015 UTC,I agree.  Sometimes you'll see them in glass containers or like a shoe or something and it's clearly for looks.  But this doesn't even look that good so I figured maybe it's so crazy it's actually for a good reason - maybe cork really lets the soil drain or something... But I couldn't find a suitable explanation anywhere.   Guess it's just the quirky DIY playdate project of the year.

succulents,38au3y,DarklyNoon,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:43:43 2015 UTC,"When there is no drain hole, salts build up in the soil. Most succulents struggle if there is much salt in the soil. Distilled or rain water help prevent this."

Well, I'm more into cacti and she loves succulents. Anywho, I'm slowly convincing her that terracotta is good. Glazed pottery, toolboxes, tin cans, corks, old boots, cast iron cookware, jars, pots with no drain hole are bad. BAD, BAD, BAD!  FUCK PINTEREST!!!!!!!!!!!!1!!!! IT KILLS SO MANY LOVELY PLANTS!

succulents,38au3y,panniculus,4,Wed Jun 3 13:04:07 2015 UTC,"Okay, I know I'm getting into some ~controversial territory~ here in the succulent lover community but to be honest... Some of my plants do better in glazed pots. Hear me out. I mean, they still need drainage holes, but terra cotta pots (especially small ones commonly used with succulents) suck TOO much moisture from the soil, especially combined with peat-based mixes (that become hydrophobic when dry) that, let's face it, the majority of succulent growers use. I've repotted plants from 4-5"" terra cotta pots that have a huge solid mat of dead root hairs encircling the terra cotta. My new philosophy is that at least for small pots, glazed or impermeable may actually be better than terra cotta. For larger sizes I still go for terra cotta, though.  Also... I'm personally of the school of thought that a touch bit of heat/water stress that brings out the colors in my plants is totally fine. It's not like it hurts the plants. As long as there's no scarring, it's all good in my book."
succulents,38au3y,BabuGillis,5,Wed Jun 3 16:04:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, thank you. Plastic and glazed pots are fine. You should certainly modify your watering habits and soil content accordingly, but too dry is absolutely an issue with succulents. It's funny seeing panicked ""REPLANT ASAP"" comments on pictures of healthy plants in plastic pots. Some of the plants, especially slow growing cacti for example, are in peat-heavy soil and plastic pots for years before you see them in the nursery and take them home."
succulents,38au3y,kallan133,2,Wed Jun 3 17:50:44 2015 UTC,"To be honest, this is the first time I've seen people say that glazed pots and plastic is bad.  Plastic can retain moisture, sure, but I use it and adjust accordingly."
succulents,38au3y,DarklyNoon,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:54:10 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, like anything else, it depends. I live in North Alabama so our humidity is usually around 90%. Depends on the kind of succulent as well.  I've got some Purslane in a plastic hanging basket that grows like wildfire and it stays wet. Several others are in glazed pots.  The peat based stuff is useless around here, holds water for too long due to the high humidity. Even normal plants can rot with that. I make my own mixes using topsoil, perlite, vermiculate, coarse sand, and pea gravel depending on the plant.  However, terracotta is the usual container.  Don't fuck up my Pinterest hate party with your logic and shit."
succulents,38au3y,wing_dings,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:53:58 2015 UTC,"I was recently thinking about terracotta vs. glazed pots and plastic. Terracotta is the most ideal option for cacti/succulents in less-than-ideal soil. Peat-based soil is total shit, and supposed cacti and succulent soil is loaded with it. Never. Again.  I'm finding that switching mediums to near 100% mineral/grit like pumice paired with plastic or glazed pots is better. That way the water drains right through and stays wet just long enough for the roots to get what they need without drowning in it or drying out too much."

succulents,38au3y,havinabadtime,2,Wed Jun 3 18:24:16 2015 UTC,"Hey there, I hope it's ok to ask a question.  Why are glazed pots bad?  I have a big jade in a glazed ceramic pot and it is doing really good now but don't want it to cause problems in the future because its my favorite.  Its about a 2' tall and 1.5' wide plant and I would hate to murder one that old and nice."
succulents,38au3y,DarklyNoon,2,Wed Jun 3 17:04:06 2015 UTC,"I was being hyperbolic. It will probably be just fine. It depends on your relative humidity and soil mix. With my RH usually around 90% I have to fight rot a lot.  The one thing that I think is a must is a drain hole.  Even so, my grandmother had a jade that was 2 or 3 feet tall and lived in a plastic pot. The pot was undersized for the plant and she never repotted, however.  My jades are in terra cotta, but my soil mix for them includes some vermiculate.  Just make sure it is drying out pretty well between waterings. Some people wait until they see some shriveling."
succulents,38au3y,havinabadtime,2,Wed Jun 3 20:02:02 2015 UTC,Thank you for the information I was ready to go buy a new pot immediately if I was hurting it.  I will start looking for leaves to shrivel a bit before watering.  Should i do the same with the two small jades i have?  When I bought the big one it was really limp and had to be held up by two bamboo stakes.  Now it holds itself up after repotted with a good mix and gravel at the bottom to help drain more.  I also dump any extra water out of the saucer but try to only water it until the water barely starts to collect there.  http://imgur.com/bS7M3sR I let it hang out on the deck on sunny days too.  I try to do that for all my plants but that one especially.
succulents,38au3y,DarklyNoon,2,Wed Jun 3 21:56:34 2015 UTC,"Looks pretty good. Leaves seem a little skinny but Idk if that is the variety of jade or etoliation. I water my small jades more frequently as they dry out faster. You don't have to let shriveling happen, but is better than over watering.  Edit: also, when I water, I water heavy. I water until it pours out the bottom. Washes salts out of the soil."
succulents,38au3y,havinabadtime,2,Wed Jun 3 22:32:27 2015 UTC,I'll start doing that.  Its goblin jade and since I got it its kicked out a whole lot of new growth and they are all small.  Do they fatten up or am I doing it wrong?

succulents,38au3y,havinabadtime,2,Wed Jun 3 23:04:36 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I hope its on to ask one more question.  On the branches the brown bark like stuff is shedding.  It has green under it so I'm assuming maybe it outgrew its dry skin and it growing?  Is that a thing with big jades?  My others are so small they are just really green not brown."

While they looked good the plants weren't happy, they were suffering and I ended up moving everything to pots.

succulents,38aqnf,AllAccessAndy,2,Wed Jun 3 00:15:35 2015 UTC,"It's actually an Echeveria. I would remove the Spanish moss (the stringy stuff on top).

succulents,38aqnf,AllAccessAndy,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:04:32 2015 UTC,"I figured it would have the plastic pot.

succulents,387b2h,slayher_,2,Wed Jun 3 21:05:51 2015 UTC,"I would say that since you are outdoors and summer is coming, you might want to give them a good drenching once a week or so or even more often depending on how hot it gets."
succulents,387b2h,puffinque,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:41:12 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more. they'll do far better with a heavy shower, less frequently, than with a regular misting. Just make sure your pots have drainage holes."
succulents,387b2h,thecakeisnotalie,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:48:35 2015 UTC,Do you know what the pink spiky one is from photo 1?
succulents,387b2h,puffinque,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:02:23 2015 UTC,It is an Aloe sp. I am not good with Aloes but Aloe brevifolia looks like that if you are looking for something similar. That one is pink because it is severely being stressed by sunlight.
succulents,387b2h,sashafurgang,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:22:03 2015 UTC,Aloe brevifolia   thank you!

succulents,38alq4,ktknee,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:29:34 2015 UTC,Left is some kind of aloe - looks similar to haworthia. The right looks like grapetopetulum.
succulents,388w3h,sashafurgang,2,Tue Jun 2 17:46:07 2015 UTC,It definitely looks ready to separate. Even if the smaller one comes away with no roots you can just set it on dry soil and it'll pop out some new ones. Just don't water until there are.
succulents,388w3h,epicrobotbattle,2,Tue Jun 2 19:56:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I'm reading a lot of contradictory information about watering when propagating...  So a pup that I cut off should not be watered until it gets roots of its own.  But individual leaves need spraying until they sprout?  What about the head of a plant from a decapitation? Same as pup I guess?  I have a ""head"" that I let dry for several days until it crusted over, but then I was told to stick it in moist soil and leave in not too much light so it'd concentrate on rooting... Was that inaccurate?"
succulents,388w3h,kallan133,2,Tue Jun 2 20:02:30 2015 UTC,"I can understand the confusion, and I think it comes from the fact that it really depends on your environment.  Keeping them in dry soil is typically what should be done.  However, for me, in my very dry environment, have found that I actually get roots and shoots (after they're calloused) if I keep the soil moist but not soggy.  The cuttings actually dry up too quickly otherwise.  But this is what worked for me, whereas most people get better results in dry soil.  Sometimes, you just have to experiment to see what's best for you.  Does that help?"
succulents,388w3h,kallan133,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:01:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah that helps! thank you.  I can't say I live in a dry climate, but Canada is also not Southern California. I'll leave my newly potted head in moist soil for now and see how that goes. If it rots I'll have learned something..."
succulents,388w3h,epicrobotbattle,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:07:41 2015 UTC,"I've been to Southern California, it has more moisture than where I live."
succulents,388w3h,doablysad,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:11:08 2015 UTC,As long as the soil isn't wet I don't think it would be a big deal if the plant was left to callous long enough.
succulents,388w3h,Offred26,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:18:33 2015 UTC,"I received this guy from an online purchase a few weeks ago. I hadn't read up a lot about propagation at that point, and was just way too eager to get the plants into decent roomy pots. But now that I look at it, it really looks like it could be split into two plants...  Does it look urgent given the size of the pot, or could they coexist for a while?  Is it better to wait a little bit and get them acclimatized to my house before attempting anything?  Thanks!!"
succulents,388w3h,Offred26,2,Tue Jun 2 17:51:18 2015 UTC,you could do it now. just rinse the roots and gently pull them apart. assuming there's two stems.
succulents,388w3h,secretagentkitty,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:02:35 2015 UTC,"I would say it depends...do the two rosettes still share a main stem/roots? That would make it harder but I'm not familiar with propagating this particular type of succulent.   I have a few that, like this one, would probably be happier divided. For mine I'm waiting until their roots recover from some divisions I did last week. I'll put up some pictures :)"
succulents,388r03,StrealTreal,3,Tue Jun 2 17:18:37 2015 UTC,"1) Portulacaria afra. 2) Sedum, or a hybrid of a Sedum? 3) Sansevieria trifasciata, probably marginata because of the yellow border. 4) Crassula mucosa. Blooms tiny, tiny flowers in the winter. Smells like old gym socks."
succulents,388r03,tahonte,2,Tue Jun 2 19:04:25 2015 UTC,fourth is princess pine. fifth is a snake plant.  second is a very etiolated succulent.  hard to tell for me but give all of these lots of sun and make sure the soil is all dry before watering them (and not just the top of the soil).    if you wanted to replace the soil.  try potting soil/perelite 1:1 mix.    I would also suggest the snake plant be separate from the other small succulents.  snake plants have slightly different requirements from normal succulents. can survive in low light and can survive with a lot less water. you could legitimately put them in a corner.  the other four I would suggest finding a southeast windowsill.
succulents,388r03,doablysad,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:18:14 2015 UTC,"Water less, more sun, and put a layer of rocks or sand as top layer so the plants are sitting in a faster draining medium and are sitting higher up at the lip of the container.  Not sure what kind of soil mix you have but it looks fine. Maybe mix it with some of the rocks or sand you could top it with.   Succulents will tolerate whatever, but that should help these guys getting into form."
succulents,388gle,Zowwmeoww,2,Tue Jun 2 16:22:50 2015 UTC,Are they on the plant or do they crawl around on the surface of the soil? Can they fly?
succulents,388gle,thecakeisnotalie,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:37:39 2015 UTC,They just crawl on the surface of the soil.
succulents,388gle,thecakeisnotalie,2,Tue Jun 2 21:41:00 2015 UTC,Do they look like they might be fungus gnats?
succulents,388gle,emperor000,2,Tue Jun 2 22:09:21 2015 UTC,It's going to be hard to help without a picture.
succulents,388gle,doablysad,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:19:51 2015 UTC,rubbing alcohol and a q tip. or a part rubbing alcohol and part water spray of its a lot.  do this first and stream the plants under water.  replace the soil too if you feel it's needed

succulents,386by8,jimmayyy,1 point,Tue Jun 2 08:17:22 2015 UTC,cissus tuberosa   Having looked this plant up I am now 99% sure this is indeed what I have here.  A good third of the google images labelled as such looked spot on like it.  Thanks!
succulents,386by8,bmb222,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:50:39 2015 UTC,"Seems like it will grow swollen nodes which can then be planted under soil and will grow into a new plant. You can probably get a second pot of soil, submerge some of the vine in the soil while leaving the growth tip out, and it should root that way and then be cut into a separate plant if you want to propagate more."
succulents,386by8,Needle88,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:36:55 2015 UTC,This is not cissus tuberosa the leaves are wrong to start with. here's mine
succulents,386by8,bmb222,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:35:52 2015 UTC,They are nearly identical to about half of the one's google is picking up under C.tuberosa. Young leaves vs. old leaves? Subspecies variation? I'm seeing various images of leaves ranging from yours to the original posted
succulents,386by8,bmb222,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:58:03 2015 UTC,"cissus tuberosa   This is it, good looking plant"
succulents,386by8,desertstini,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:26:00 2015 UTC,"OP here.  So I'll admit I'm not at all certain this plant is a succulent, but I tentatively think it is.  Despite having a rather bark-like exterior it has the semi-soft sort of rigidity of a firm succulent, and its branches are perilously fragile.  Not very shrub or tree-like at all, in terms of physical properties rather than appearance.  Anyway, besides the lighter for scale, the only other major point I can think of is that it only grows leaves, no flowers - and it does that once a year.  So I suppose it goes... dormant, for a while?  I really have no idea what this plant is, and haven't had much luck trying to get an identification before, so I'm hoping reddit can help."
succulents,386by8,desertstini,1 point,Tue Jun 2 04:06:49 2015 UTC,"My fingers are crossed. Hoping for even a cursory identification. I landscape in the Phonenix, AZ area and have these weird succulent/bulb things growing and climbing trees. Would love to know what they are."
succulents,385r83,sashafurgang,3,Tue Jun 2 01:22:49 2015 UTC,"I use a watering can and water my large collection when the soil is dry. In the spring that's about 3 times a week. I live in CA and the summers get into the triple digits. I keep my succulents a mostly shaded area so the sun doesn't overwhelm.   The only time I use a spray is when propagating. Those little plants get damaged when watering with a  watering can. When propagating, I water once a day.   I would not recommend submerging in water. over watering will cause rot.   The basic key to watering syucculents is to water when the soil is dry."
succulents,385r83,candola,5,Tue Jun 2 02:24:11 2015 UTC,"Most of my fat plants live on a window sill. Usually a few days after the soil appears dry, the  plants will start to get a little soft. I run the tap over their soil until water begins to drain from the pot. Then I gently shake and tilt the pot until it seems to stop draining, and put them back in the window. For pots without drainage I make sure it's never totally soaked, and will eventually replace them with better pots. And for Itty bitty plants I use a spray bottle to soak the soil around them.   After watering, they plump up and the leaves will be pretty hard."
succulents,385r83,GodDonut,2,Tue Jun 2 12:55:57 2015 UTC,"For most I use soft water and drench. I used a spray bottle on fresh leaf cuttings. I find soil type is more important than watering specifics. The right soil will help you to water properly.  How can watering techniques affect plants? Drenching potted plants such that the water runs through will keep salt from building up in the soil that is present in all but the purest water sources. If not by flooding the salt out, then some other method that dilutes it should be used at least occasionally."
succulents,385r83,PM_ME_UR_PLANTS,2,Tue Jun 2 03:02:12 2015 UTC,"For me, it depends on the stage of the succulent. The older more well established plants get soaked (I use a measuring cup and water the soil until it floods slightly) about every 5 days. They're on a windowsill inside so sometimes they go a little longer before they need it. I try my best to keep the water off the leaves.   I have plants that I'm currently propagating, the leaves with itty bitty plants get spritzed with a water bottle daily until the soil below them is wet but not soaked. The offshoots that have a fairly well established plant but are working on roots get watered only when their soil has completely dried out.   I'm sure it depends on how well draining your container is but this system seems to work for me."
succulents,385r83,Offred26,2,Tue Jun 2 04:35:04 2015 UTC,"You should only have to spray if your pot and/or soil is less than ideal. Otherwise you should be able to drench. Submerge would work, too, but it's not really necessary and it seems like you'd just lose soil doing that.  If you have proper soil and a pot, especially if the plant is outside, you should just water it thoroughly and wait for the soil to dry to water again.  Spraying is just going to water the top of the soil and the plant is not going to get much if any water."
succulents,385r83,emperor000,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:58:51 2015 UTC,"I have two very large pots with citrus trees and then several succulents around the trunk, I water that with the water hose 2-3x a week. I'm in central Texas and it gets really hot here. All my other ones in small pots I water with a watering can whenever the soil dries out. Each plant is different on how quick the soil dries out! I've learned that the sedums can tolerate a lot wider range than some of the echeveria as well."
succulents,385r83,pnkpanthr25,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:30:13 2015 UTC,"I agree! Echeveria have not taken well to me at all, even though many of my other plants do wonderfully. They seem really sensitive to sunlight in my experience as well. Sedum however.. They really mean it when they call it ground cover."
succulents,385r83,ILoveMySenpai,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:59:59 2015 UTC,I do two passes on my plants.  The first pass is with plain tap water and is meant to fully wet the medium and dissolve any salts in the potting mix.  After that I let the plants sit for about 10 minutes and then fertigate.  Ideally I would do this once or twice a week.
succulents,385r83,dbforr,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:32:35 2015 UTC,"I use a water bottle and divide up the water in it among my plants that are starting to feel a bit soft. The water should go in the soil, not on the plant."

succulents,385r83,black_rose_,1 point,Tue Jun 2 05:23:13 2015 UTC,"I'm in south-east Canada. The summer months get fairly hot (35C/95F in the sun) and usually very humid. So I think I'll be able to take the pots outside for June through most of September. But beyond that they'll probably have to live by a south-facing window as the nights will start getting cold, and then there'll be 5ft of snow..."
succulents,385r83,black_rose_,2,Tue Jun 2 16:23:23 2015 UTC,"I would only water it when the soil feels quite dry. Since it's humid, don't water it very much when you do, and avoid getting water on the leaves. Pour water directly onto the soil."
succulents,385r83,Sparkle_Chimp,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:26:39 2015 UTC,"If your plants live indoors, giving them a bath outside when it rains will do them some good. I don't know how they know, but they love natural rainwater. Just be careful about leaving them out there if it's raining for a long time (24 hr+) or if it rains and then turns really hot and sunny but they're not acclimated.   Also, while I wouldn't normally soak the pots, if you have one that you forgot to water for a while and it's all dried out, a 30 minute soak may help.  Finally, be warned that the signs and symptoms of overwatering are often very similar to underwatering. As others have said, wait until the soil is dry."

There was a big hill I used to have to walk up on the way home from school. I figured that it would probably look like a slope, that my mind had exaggerated how steep it was but nope, it was steep!

I keep my succulents on my front porch where they get a little morning sun, but absolutely no heat-of-the-day sun.  It's a very bright spot, but much more direct sun and I think mine would toast.    I'd recommend using succulent potting soil for good drainage.  Water regularly, checking that the soil is dry first, and try not to get the water on the leaves.

You'll want a pot with a hole at the bottom so that excess water has somewhere to go and isn't sitting at the bottom of the pot, rotting the roots. I use cheap plastic orchid pots, since I have a ton of plants and am constantly repotting. As for soil, I do a 50/50 mix of cactus soil and volcanic pumice.

succulents,3842fd,anysize,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:12:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'm in Toronto. Grow Something's website isn't very comprehensive, but I know they have small hanging pots of string-of-pearls under $10.

succulents,382vz4,UncleEck,3,Mon Jun 1 16:05:48 2015 UTC,Thank you! I took to google looking at images because the D. Cooperi is similar but not exactly it. Turns out it's a species of Trichodiadema which is from the same family.  I'm supposing care-wise it shouldn't be too different to advice given for ice plants?
succulents,382vz4,UncleEck,2,Mon Jun 1 16:38:28 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I was sort of shooting in the dark in terms of IDing it. I just picked up an ice plant for my rock garden the other day and your pic was reminding me of it.

succulents,384ase,daktoberfest,3,Mon Jun 1 19:24:32 2015 UTC,"They need an appropriately sized pot, no more than an inch bigger than the root ball. Good light all day.   NO SPRITZING! Water when dry, soak, the pot (preferably clay), let it dry out, soak again. Mine are in a south window and I water them every couple of weeks, maybe every three, in the summer, less in the winter when they get less light. I have large ones I water when I remember. With cacti, better to under than overwater but by that I mean frequency.   If you spritz, the water is not getting to the deeper roots. If you just water lightly on the top, that's where the roots will grow and they will burn out.  Any spiny cactus is easy."
succulents,3839ru,PabloDiablo43,3,Mon Jun 1 15:22:28 2015 UTC,"I have a log written in a notebook for plant name, common name, when it was acquired, light requirements, general water requirements, and any grow/dormancy periods. This is mainly for identification and seasonal changes in care but when it comes to watering I always just evaluate each plant every few days and decide then. I also have way too many plants so this works for me. :)"
succulents,3839ru,mellymarie1123,2,Mon Jun 1 17:45:52 2015 UTC,"I tried doing this but my collection grew way too quickly.  I use a calendar to mark up group of plants.  Like, kalanchoes typically like watering once to twice a week (I have to test the soil and leaves), the haworthia get a watering every two-three weeks in the summer, cacti are around once a month (season dependent), and the rest seem to do fine on a two week watering schedule.  There are exceptions and those get marked on the calendar.  I keep thinking about giving plants away to make this all so much easier, but every time I try I find that I can't pick any one plant that I could do without."
succulents,3839ru,kallan133,2,Mon Jun 1 17:32:35 2015 UTC,I have a Chinese take-out calendar hanging close to my plants. I circle the days that I water with a marker. I have three different colors for my groups that have different water needs. I circle accordingly. Keep it simple! :]
succulents,382f3z,stellersjay,2,Mon Jun 1 10:56:32 2015 UTC,"You need to consistently give them direct sunlight daily to prevent that gangly effect, called etiolation. They are full sun plants, and a weekend feeding of sun will never be enough. Get a grow light, or better yet, find some plants better suited to a shade location. Office lights will never be enough light for the babies you have right now, and unless you have a south facing window you can place them directly against, they won't be happy.   If you're dead set on succulents for the office, try something from the haworthia or gasteria family. They like shade. I would try some kind of full shade plant instead though!   Both leafy fellows look like prime candidates for propagation. Cuttings or leaves can make a new plant."
succulents,382f3z,0rganelle,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:59:46 2015 UTC,"Glorious! Thanks so much. I might move these babies (love that you call them babies) home and get some shade plants for the office. I have been looking into a large, trailing shade plant. Still too much sun for something like a nice ivy. Thanks so much for the tips! I mean, they seem to be doing ""okay"". I know the light situation is less than ideal for full-sun plants."
succulents,382f3z,kallan133,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:41:46 2015 UTC,"I have seen people say Haworthia for offices a bunch recently.  Unless he/she can still get some sun, and by sun I mean that there is a window that gives off bright indirect light, then haworthia still etiolate.  Office fluorescent lights don't provide nearly enough light and is basically too dark even for these shade loving succulents.  I know sanseveria do really well in dark conditions, though."
succulents,382f3z,kallan133,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:49:17 2015 UTC,"Sanseveria do well in the shade.  There are other non-succulent plants that do well in office settings like certain bromeliads and ferns.  I might also mention that you should probably remove the crested mammillaria elongata out of that pot.  It's more tolerant of water than other cacti, but it will eventually rot because it requires less water than the other succulents in that pot.  Also, if you are going to change pots, get a pot with drainage holes.  I usually recommend terra cotta because they're the easiest, but it's fine to go with other types.  You can drill holes into other pots that don't already have a hole.  Some people are really good at not overwatering a pot with no drainage, but it's hard to judge without having more experience."

succulents,380ftp,doablysad,3,Mon Jun 1 00:49:59 2015 UTC,it probably needs a bit more sun if you want it from growing taller.  I assume it's an indoor plant? but it's natural. the only thing I would worry about is it the leaves were largely spaced out.
succulents,380ftp,slayher_,3,Mon Jun 1 01:40:35 2015 UTC,Classic topsy turvy behaviour. Mine looks exactly like yours and continues to drop the bottom leaves no matter what I do.

succulents,380h5k,cassieness,3,Sun May 31 23:04:31 2015 UTC,"Hrmmm   Okay, for the wilty branch you could cut it off at the bend and either let it scab over and then propagate the cutting, or you could eat it or use it for whatever. The scabbed over areas are perfectly fine, this is what most succulents do when they're cut. As for the soil and pot, I personally would replant it in a bigger pot because the small pot might be causing it to become unbalanced. If the aloe has been grown in this soil and seems to be doing fine (not wilting, not rotting, no mealy bugs or anything) then personally I'd go the safe route and keep that soil, but if you need more soil for a bigger pot then mix your own ""cactus mix"". As for when to water it, I water all of my plants based on when they decide they need water. This probably isn't the best method but I feel that it's the best way for me to avoid over-watering something. Most plants will become limp and floppy when they need water, and I imagine this is the same for aloe vera (although I'm quite new to owning aloe plants, so don't quote me on that, I'm going by trial and error). Personally I'd give it some water to see if this will help out with the bent leaves because the soil looks a bit dry. Most succulents like bright light and don't tolerate very cold temperatures well (so don't put it outside in the winter or fall). If this aloe has been kept indoors, try to harden it off to the sun by moving it into indirect sunlight more and more each day until it's in bright sunlight. Suddenly shoving it in direct sunlight outdoors can kill or sunburn a plant.   Here are some more aloe tips: http://www.aloeplant.info/treat-your-aloe-as-you-would-like-your-aloe-to-treat-you/  Thank you for posting these images, by the way. I've been on the hunt for an aloe vera but I've been confused by the colouring or markings of ones that look similar to yours. Fortunately, I saw one at a garden center with these light green dots and I know to get it next time I'm out!!

succulents,380h5k,Volkodavy,2,Mon Jun 1 01:28:05 2015 UTC,No problem!!! Good luck with your aloe! :)
succulents,380h5k,eh_me_ree,2,Mon Jun 1 02:40:54 2015 UTC,"I've had my aloe vera plant for a few years now and a lot I've learned is from trial and error. Generally, I water once every 2 weeks, once a week in the summer. I live in an apartment and I used to have it by the window, but that was too much sun and it got sunburned so I moved it away from the window. Other than that, it's incredibly chill and I don't have to worry about it at all. Now it's HUGE!  If I were you, I would replant it in a bigger pot with cactus soil. When you replant it though, try to replant it at an angle so it will stand up straight.  The leaves should be firm with some give, it shouldn't be very squishy. With enough sunlight, the leaves that will grow wouldn't be as stretched out as that (they're stretching to reach the sun, or so I've read).  As a baker, I burn myself a lot and this is perfect! With a sharp knife, cut a low leaf/part of leaf and just rub it on a burn. Some people eat them too.  Enjoy =)"
succulents,380h5k,eh_me_ree,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:15:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I am planning to repot it tonight in a pot that's a bit deeper with some cactus mix. The angle idea is smart, thanks!  I currently have it by my window in my bedroom but my house is generally kinda dark so I don't think too much sun will be an issue. I think too little sun will be a bigger issue but I will keep an eye on it.   I've already cut off the bendy part and put some of the gel on my face, it really helps soothe my super acne-prone skin! I'm so glad I picked this up, it seems like such a good plant.  Thank you!"
succulents,380ddx,TriggerHippie0202,3,Sun May 31 22:34:16 2015 UTC,That tall one is cool. Let it grow taller lol.

succulents,380ddx,Hardrainfalling,2,Tue Jun 2 07:33:43 2015 UTC,"Haha, I think I meant to kick them both off when I came inside for the picture of the 2nd plant...it's around somewhere :P"
succulents,380ddx,Hardrainfalling,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:13:07 2015 UTC,Cute!
succulents,380ddx,doablysad,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:31:40 2015 UTC,that is a very tall succulent.  it's honestly up to you. if you find it's hard for it to stand on its own I would cut it where it stops being green (to the brown/woody part). and let it callous and root.  do not water it until it roots.    the stem part may grow another succulent but mines usually does not.    the bottom two pots are also your choice. they looks happy and healthy as they are (except maybe get a bigger pot?).  but I think they would make great trades.
succulents,380bmk,ILoveMySenpai,11,Sun May 31 22:20:55 2015 UTC,Looks like grass.

succulents,380bmk,theguywiththebeard,11,Sun May 31 22:31:43 2015 UTC,"If you bought seeds, give them a little more time. Pull the grass and wait. Every pot that I put outside gets grass trying to grow in it."
succulents,380bmk,Nicker,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:34:06 2015 UTC,"I hadn't thought of that! I had kept them covered for the majority of the time, but it could have been in the soil to begin with!"
succulents,380bmk,fishlips_,3,Mon Jun 1 12:57:39 2015 UTC,"Could be that there were just not the right conditions for the seeds to grow, some grass seeds floated into your pot over time and just sprouted up since nothing else was growing."
succulents,380bmk,luala,2,Mon Jun 1 03:41:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, definitely not a succulent!"

succulents,37y637,badsustainabilitist,2,Sun May 31 11:37:22 2015 UTC,"Jade plants (crassula ovata) are practically invincible, nice to look at, and not spikey or anything like that. Properly pruned, they will grow into a nice tree (just google image ""jade plant"") but they are slow growers so don't worry about it becoming massive any time soon. You can also propagate it by just pulling off a leaf and throwing it on some dirt, which is nice.  Sansiveria is also very easy to care for, grows to a nice size depending on the variety you get, and is also void of spikes or anything like that. You can get normal sansiveria or you can get sansiveria cylindrica which looks like green cones sticking out of the dirt. Both are easy, both are cool."
succulents,37y637,corvustock,2,Sun May 31 13:41:06 2015 UTC,Does jade need to be in a window or would flourescent office lights be enough?
succulents,37y637,NOTORIOUS187,3,Sun May 31 15:23:00 2015 UTC,All succulents except maybe sansevieria need more than office fluorescents.
succulents,37y637,panniculus,2,Sun May 31 18:27:18 2015 UTC,"sansiveria cylindrica    I have one of these and have never seen any in stores or online anywhere. I was starting to think it was a mutant snake plant, which I guess it sorta is. When my mom gave it to me it looked like the first one in this picture. Now it has new sections growing that aren't as sturdy looking. Do you think i'd be able to braid them like the second one in that picture?"

succulents,37y637,Bocconcini,1 point,Sun May 31 17:16:45 2015 UTC,"Haworthia are pretty low maintenance, don't require as much light as most succulents."
succulents,37xxnr,my7sins,5,Sun May 31 09:22:35 2015 UTC,Many succulents are adapted to live in that type of environment. I'd bet there's some native plants where you live that are succulents. I have about 20-30 succulents and it was around 40c here today too.  Your indoor temperatures are perfect though.  Seeds may be difficult and take a long time - it's up to you if you want to try that. I haven't been successful in sprouting from a seed yet (though I most likely haven't given them ideal conditions to sprout.)
succulents,37xxnr,disneyfacts,4,Sun May 31 09:29:37 2015 UTC,That is one of the problems i dropped by a nursery yesterday and they seem to only have one or two types of succulents :( I have fallen in love with living stones and have not been able to find any here which drove my obsession for wanting to grow my own.
succulents,37xxnr,disneyfacts,3,Sun May 31 09:47:23 2015 UTC,"They are certainly a lot cheaper if you do it by seed. Not saying that they won't sprout in that environment, you just have to give them good conditions for sprouting - although I haven't been successful with seeds, I have gotten cuttings to sprout very easily.  Most nurseries don't seem to have the lithops, but sometimes if you search log enough you can find them. You may want to consider getting some shipped to you if that isn't too expensive."
succulents,37xxnr,disneyfacts,3,Sun May 31 10:01:01 2015 UTC,I was considering that as well which is why i was looking through ebay. Is it safe to order cuttings? or will they rot before they get here ?
succulents,37xxnr,salaciousopossum,1 point,Sun May 31 10:17:43 2015 UTC,"Depends on the shipping time. I sent out some cuttings and made sure they got there within 3 days. I had gotten cuttings for them earlier, but they started sprouting pretty quickly. I had to get new cuttings for them. Some leaves of the plants may rot, but that doesn't mean the whole plant is bad, you just need a leaf in most cases.  Basically, choose the fastest shipping you're willing to afford."
succulents,37xxnr,disneyfacts,1 point,Sun May 31 10:37:25 2015 UTC,I've had good experiences with ordering living stones online. They come in lots of bubble wrap and survive a week or so I'm transit.
succulents,37xxnr,Astilaroth,2,Sun May 31 13:52:08 2015 UTC,Thank you friend :) sorry for taking long to reply! I will do a few more nursery runs and hope i get lucky.

succulents,37xxnr,OrAnGu,2,Tue Jun 2 08:52:27 2015 UTC,"Lithops seeds are dead cheap here, i recently bought some from a local hobby club. Haven't tried germinating them yet but my dad has an most popped up. So yeah try to get some seeds online! Do check import regulations for seeds though, some countries are super harsh with non-native species.  If you can't find any I'm willing to get some more here and send them to you if you want. Let me know I'm sure we can work something out :)"
succulents,37xxnr,emperor000,1 point,Sun May 31 12:21:28 2015 UTC,Thank you so much :) Im still doing my research here but i assume it should be fine to import the seeds.
succulents,37xxnr,emperor000,4,Tue Jun 2 08:29:49 2015 UTC,One consideration when ordering plants online from another country or region is importing non-native pests to the local environment.  For this reason I avoid it.

I haven't watered it in a week (last Sunday) and just noticed this yesterday.    could it be some sort of water damage? (like still water on the leaves) or is this natural?
succulents,37wn2s,UncreativeArtist,3,Sun May 31 00:39:04 2015 UTC,The one on the left is Kalanchoe fedtschenkoi 'Variegata'. It needs a pot 4 inches/10cm deep and a foot wide. Plant grows sideways on stilt roots.

succulents,37v88b,LindsayChristine,2,Sat May 30 18:01:03 2015 UTC,you actually don't have to stick leaves into dirt.  you can lay them on top and watch them grow.  I know some like gollums need to be stuck in dirt but I just lay mine flat.

succulents,37xgre,ceris13,2,Sun May 31 05:22:50 2015 UTC,"You'd have to drill a hole in the glass, which can be very tricky and dangerous to do without breaking the glass. Rocks only help facilitate drainage when there's a drainage hole- otherwise the water just accumulates in the bottom and causes rot. /u/SiloHawk has made it work, though, and posts here from time to time. You can ask them for tips."
succulents,37xgre,another-thing,3,Sun May 31 07:03:45 2015 UTC,"Mine is a 46 gallon tank, and its still super difficult to keep watered correctly.  I don't know if this would really be feasible with something  smaller unless it were left outside in a dry climate."
succulents,37v8j9,thebananabear,4,Sat May 30 18:03:18 2015 UTC,"Watering is not so much about how often as it is about how it's done. Basic rule of thumb: water until the entire root column is soaked (you'll know when water runs out of the drainage hole at the bottom), then let soil completely dry out before watering again. In my environment, this is usually about once weekly.  Also, you may want to consider adding a top dressing like gravel or small pebbles. I think it helps dirt not splash out everywhere when you water, keeps the top dirt from looking crusty, plus it looks nice! :)"
succulents,37v8j9,secretagentkitty,2,Sat May 30 18:44:25 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for the advice! :)

succulents,37v8j9,LegendaryCactus,2,Sat May 30 20:36:08 2015 UTC,I've caught talk of pebbles holding in moisture and making overwatering a little more of a problem.
succulents,37v8j9,secretagentkitty,2,Sat May 30 22:33:06 2015 UTC,I don't see the harm if they're on the top as a dressing and the pot has good drainage and proper soil.
succulents,37v8j9,LegendaryCactus,1 point,Sun May 31 00:11:01 2015 UTC,They can still trap a little moisture if they're tightly packed rocks. I may just worry too much.

They look like they have paint on them, I would wash that off if you can. They look much better without it. The Haworthia actually has a clear section on the leaves!"
succulents,37v189,disneyfacts,2,Sat May 30 17:51:20 2015 UTC,Thank you! Any tips on caring for them?
succulents,37v189,disneyfacts,3,Sat May 30 17:54:24 2015 UTC,Wash off the paint. Keep them in bright indirect light and water only when the soil is dry below the surface. That's pretty much it!

succulents,37py0q,lethargiccoconut,1 point,Fri May 29 19:19:59 2015 UTC,Is that a couple of Senecio Rowleyanus? I really like that plant and have one myself but the leafs are nowhere near as chunky as yours. Bit jealous here. Very pretty collection.
succulents,37py0q,kernowgringo,1 point,Fri May 29 17:32:01 2015 UTC,Yes those are! Are you watering them enough? I wasn't watering my plants enough previously and they started to shrink. I began soaking them once the soil is dry and they totally plumped up.
succulents,37py0q,kernowgringo,1 point,Fri May 29 17:48:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it gets plenty enough water, it is quite a young plant started from a cutting a few months ago, it's probably already swelled to twice the size it was when I got it, so you never know now we're moving into the summer it'll get some more sun and it might swell to the sizes near yours. Either way still one of my favourite succulents and relatively hard to get hold of here in the UK."
succulents,37py0q,secretagentkitty,1 point,Fri May 29 17:52:22 2015 UTC,Nice haul! Tips: keep that gorgeous Echeveria Perle von Nurnberg (the pale purple one) in a place where it gets plenty of sun to help it keep the nice compact rosette shape and color!

Contrary to the way it looks, it's not technically a cactus.   Apparently it can release some sap or something similar that irritates your skin so keep an eye on that.

succulents,37qk1w,silchi,5,Fri May 29 17:43:53 2015 UTC,"Seconded on the ID! And yes, it will indeed put out a milky sap if you break spines off or puncture it, be careful because it can definitely cause some discomfort.  It can also get massive. My best friend's parents have one that is 20+ years old, and the thing must be 10-12 feet tall. They used to have to trim it yearly, because it would start to grow along the ceiling. They're also insanely easy to propagate, from what they've told me. Lop off a piece, stick it in some dirt, and voila."

succulents,37sysb,Onixshard,2,Sat May 30 03:33:01 2015 UTC,Jade - natural loss of leaves after awhile or stress loss Perforata - looks really bad... normally they look pagodas... too much sun/heat... move to shaded/indirect sunlight Gibbiflora - brown spots usually occur when water level is low in that section. Looks like it is the lowest leaf like the Jade and could just be losing the old leaf.

I also use that soil that you do, but I haven't mixed it with the perlite. I haven't had an overwatering/wet root problem. My succulents are all housed in terra cotta pots, which is helpful because I can see how wet the pot is and when rewatering needs to occur. I use black aquarium gravel as the top dressing.  What next? Whatever you want! Learn more about each plant type you have, label your plants (I did, haha, I'm a dork).  For me, I am housing a little nursery where I am attempting to propagate. Mostly to grow as gifts for people, since I'm all out of room for plants, haha.

succulents,37n78p,breedlovehoops,2,Thu May 28 21:37:58 2015 UTC,The one in your hand just needs to be stuck in dry soil in shade. After a while it will grow roots. I have no idea what's going on with your plant that turned black unless they are outside. It might be frostbite.
succulents,37n78p,breedlovehoops,2,Thu May 28 22:10:47 2015 UTC,"They are outside, but I live in florida, so it is very hot out. Do you think its getting too much water? It storms a lot and water tends to spray onto the plant"
succulents,37n78p,isfjheartcaffeine,3,Thu May 28 22:23:55 2015 UTC,That's a tough one without seeing it in person. Dig it up and see if it has any roots. If not that would be your source of rot.

How often do I water it, and is it dormant in the winter? What is that star thing on it? What kind of soil should I use? Can I just use gravel? Will they be OK without direct sunlight, or must it be direct? Can I use a lamp instead of sunlight on cloudy days?"
succulents,37jz3r,graffiti81,3,Thu May 28 04:27:03 2015 UTC,"The 'hair' on it is a protection against too much sun. So yes, partial sun will be fine. Are the big spines attached? They look like spines off a young Ferrocactus latispinus (not my photo, but I have a pretty similar one).   The soil should be a standard cactus soil, lots of grit, some organics, should drain quickly and easily.   As for lights, you're going to spend a lot of money to replace the sun even on cloudy days. Take the light you're thinking of using outside on a cloudy day and see how much actual light it adds to whatever you're shining it on. Even on cloudy days, sunlight will be better than artificial light for your cacti.  Good luck."

succulents,37hpkv,BackToTheBasic,3,Wed May 27 20:23:42 2015 UTC,"They definitely do not look happy.  The first thing I would do is plant them in a container with a drain hole (if this does not have one).  Succulents hate having their roots sit in watery soil.  What you are seeing may be a result of them sitting in water after the first watering if the soil was allowed to get watery, even though you hadn't watered them for 2 weeks.  Another possibility that came to mind is sunburn (especially the tan one top right).  Were they sitting in shade for a long time and then exposed to a lot of sun right away?  They'll appreciate direct sun but only after being acclimated."
succulents,37hpkv,BackToTheBasic,1 point,Wed May 27 22:38:33 2015 UTC,"The dark mark was there when I got them! I did make sure to acclimate them to the sun!  I'll be transferring containers tomorrow. Should I soak the soil through after I transfer, or let them sit for a bit to make sure the soil is dry enough?  The soil is totally dry for the first 1-1.5 inches."
succulents,37hpkv,disneyfacts,1 point,Wed May 27 21:45:16 2015 UTC,"They just look like they went through some sort of recent stress.  Succulents are a little slow to respond sometimes, so don't over think it and you should notice a difference in 6 weeks.  It's hard for me to diagnose but if it is mushy rot I'd probably let them be in dry soil for a few days, then a very light watering 3 or 4 days after planting, moving to very light waterings for a few weeks, then regular succulent care thereafter.  Place the plants somewhere there is plenty of indirect bright light but not a ton of direct sun so they can have a gentle recovery.  Sometimes if rot is starting people will remove the plant from soil completely so it can dry out (few days, week?, not sure).  I've been dealing with an overwatered Aloe recently and am going through a similar thing, although I've left it in the pot.  I dunno, this is just a guess.  You're in the best position to learn what the plant is trying to tell you and learn how to respond."

succulents,37dm4f,tahonte,11,Tue May 26 21:26:10 2015 UTC,"The thing about many variegated Crassulaceae is that a leaf is the usual way to make more of them fast.

succulents,37f9qm,secretagentkitty,2,Wed May 27 05:27:13 2015 UTC,"Also keep in mind if you get a cute container, you can always ""nest"" your more functional pot with the drainage holes inside it, and lift it out to dump the excess water from the decorative pot."

They sell cactus soil at the big chain stores, but I've found that it does not drain well at all. ""When you replant your cactus plants, a mix of 50% washed sand (sandblasting sand works well), 30% natural sandy loam from the desert, and 20% coarse pumice is recommended. The natural soil has beneficial bacteria present that help plants grow better. Some weed seeds will sprout, but they will help you ""read"" the soil moisture and will quickly wilt when the soil dries out.

Source: http://www.cactusspecialties.com/#tips   I've had no luck finding pumice at the big chain stores. I bought perlite as a substitution. And when you buy sand, make sure there's no salt added to it."
succulents,37fc3w,isfjheartcaffeine,1 point,Wed May 27 14:44:25 2015 UTC,"A basic mix is garden soil with perlite mixed in (I mix to about 60/40 soil to perlite).  Then a 1/2 inch layer of pea-sized gravel mulch on top to keep the perlite from collecting on the surface when watering.  It's not the end all be all, but my plants are happy and growing.  However, I agree to stay away from bagged 'cactus soil', some of that stuff doesn't perform well at all."

I have tried to google the succulents in my box, but some are really hard for me to ID as a newbie. It would also be nice to know some care tips for these guys. I feel like most of them look a little etiolated? Should I maybe place the planter directly next to the window?"
succulents,37ccur,codez_,2,Tue May 26 16:17:44 2015 UTC,There could be cultivars of smooth variations. I even know an aloe cluster after about 2 decades have produced some interesting off shoots over the years.

I can post a different shot if you like. I prefer giving only a vague impression of what the plant looks like and making the fine detail of the flower the focus.

succulents,378gdn,mellymarie1123,1 point,Mon May 25 19:01:35 2015 UTC,I would let them be. It might be asking to be repotted in something bigger (about a inch increase in pot size).

There's no correct schedule or amount. It varies plant to plant and season to season. In the winter when they're kept cooler, I hardly water my succulents at all, maybe every 6 weeks.

It will adjust fine, it's just not anything to worry about, really. Just plants being individuals - when I've been growing leafies, some came in just right side up, some came up better from the opposite side, and some came up like crazy from top and bottom.

succulents,374620,potatoelauncher,2,Mon May 25 05:14:23 2015 UTC,"Hey guys, bought my first succulent yesterday and have some questions. From what I've researched this appears to be a Haworthia attenuata. (Correct me if I'm wrong)  I planted it in about 50/50 potting soil and perlite, and was wondering when I should water it after replanting. From what I've read it's after the leaves begin to shrink a little, but any advice is welcome.   Also, how big will this little guy get and is this pot enough?"

Don't worry about it.  You have another arm growing on the Hylocereus base, which means things could get really amusing for you if you let this baby do its business. Hylocereus is the genus that Dragon fruit belongs to, and in case you've never seen one of those grown ro maturity, I would highly suggest you do some research.

succulents,36ze51,Ivyleaf3,4,Sat May 23 12:33:09 2015 UTC,"If you just repotted it, give it some time to grow some new strong roots! Right now it's roots aren't gripping to anything cuz you just moved everything around. It looks great, just give it time. Less water equals shallow roots! Water it deep so it can go searching at the bottom. Give it as much sun as you can, you don't want it stretching more, it'll just be more likely to fall.

succulents,36yqaf,kallan133,2,Sun May 24 14:41:15 2015 UTC,"Whoops, I totally forgot I already introduced Peaches! On a different note, how do I take better care of her?"
succulents,36yqaf,kallan133,8,Sat May 23 06:30:12 2015 UTC,"As soon as that soil dries out a little bit (my experience is that nurseries have soggy soil), repot it up with a gritty mix in a pot with a drainage hole.  I'm partial to terra cotta for beginners.  And that plant looks to be around three inches (7.5 cm)?  Don't put it in a pot with too much space but don't root bound it too soon either.  Some people say to mix in 50% perlite with potting soil, but I'm more comfortable with adding 50% pumice to a premade succulent soil that isn't Miracle Gro and also adding roughly 5% course sand that doesn't contain any chemicals.  In fact, just to not complicate this, you can ignore the sand.  Sand isn't there as the sole means of drainage, it's the pumice that does that.  You can substitute the pumice for perlite.    Your little Doris Taylor  -- a.k.a. Peaches -- will need a lot of direct light (6+ with a heavy emphasis on the '+') but will need to acclimate to the sun slowly since it was greenhouse grown or it can accumulate some ugly burns.  Give it some morning sun and then introduce a little more sun everyday until it has reached the amount of sun it needs.  That should take about a week or longer if you choose so.  Efficient lighting will prevent Peaches from etiolating, growing tall and leggy, which can lead to weak growth and eventually death.  If indoors, either add a grow light (whole different discussion) or place Peaches near a western window -- or southern, but southern doesn't seem to get too much light after noon or so in certain seasons.  During Spring, depending on where you live, this still might not be enough but most of my Echeveria were content with just the western window (Southwest US, 5000 ft. elevation).  I'm too lazy to find the conversion of feet to meters, but it's roughly 1/3, so probably ~1500 meters high.  As for watering, don't water it for a week after repotting to give the plant some time to heal any damage or stress that occurred during repotting and to help prevent rot.  When you do water, water deeply until the water runs out the bottom of the pot.  My favorite method is to stick the pot in a bucket filled with water, but that isn't necessary and a lot nurseries water from overhead; just don't water the leaves or the crown as much as possible.  Water sparingly, as in probably once a week up to two weeks.  If it's indoors, you could even try for two weeks, but you really have to listen to the plant for instructions.  Listening to the plant:  watch the plant and it's growth.  Are the leaves turning yellow?  Wilting?  If so, ask yourself how much and how long has it been since you repotted or watered?  Inspect for damage (bite marks, weirdly shaped new growth, excessive wilting, white powdery substances, etc.) or weird marks that could indicate pests.  What time of year is it and where do you live that might alter the cycles the plant is in?  I don't know Peaches's exact dormancy periods, but I do know Echeveria go dormant in winter.  Water once a month or when your plant seems to need it (never more than once a week in the winter).  Some say water less, but I haven't had too much trouble watering the same.  In the summer, it might need more water.  And if you live in a climate that gets colder than or anywhere near 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 degrees Celsius), then bring it in.    I apologize if you already knew some or most of this, but, hey, I like the sound of my own voice.  Lol, and there's one very important step to all succulents:  you have to post pictures on r/succulents.  :D"

succulents,36zw4n,nimor33,1 point,Sat May 23 15:42:15 2015 UTC,I agree the first is your standard aloe vera. I beliveve the second might be Gasteraloe beguinii which is a cross between aloe aristata and gasteria batesiana.   Care and potting arangement should be similar to the cacti you own. I always repot new plants as soon as I can to check their root health and get them out of that peaty mess but they won't die if it takes you a few weeks to get around to it. :)
succulents,36zw4n,mellymarie1123,1 point,Sat May 23 16:32:13 2015 UTC,What type of soil you reccomend? Went for a quick look and the best stuff they had for succulents was peat and some perilite. Would that do the trick or should I search for more types of soil.
succulents,36zw4n,mellymarie1123,2,Sat May 23 16:43:58 2015 UTC,I use a generic succulent soil which does have some peat but I also mix in about 30% ground granite and 20% perilite. In my zone with my plants this works for me.   I've heard of people incorporating turface or using Al's gritty mix (a homemade combination) but I don't have personal experience with this method. If you can get something that drains well and are attentive you have a lot of freedom to experiment with your own system.

succulents,36z1wk,Methodicalist,2,Sat May 23 20:40:47 2015 UTC,"Agaves, Aloes, Kalanchoes grow very well - just plant them in the ground anyplace, protect from weeds and they are amazing.  Mesembs ... think the humidity is too much for them. Willing to start over and try growing some from seed. The clump of Lapidaria Margaretae that I had when I moved here was about a foot in diameter and very healthy and bloomed profusely up north. Really quite gorgeous and very old. Actually, I had several Lapidaria Margaretae. They were all in very ornate bonsai pots that were .   Up north, I grew nearly all the succulents in very shallow pots. I have a vast selection (40-60) of very beautiful real imported Japanese bonsai pots that are stoneware. Some are absolutely exquisite. I have two that I had a macrame rope hanger made for in 1978 that are just exquisitely beautiful. Most of them are pretty much empty because everything has rotted. Up north I in a window that received full sun all year long and watered sparingly.  Here, the full sun seems to rapidly bake the soil and the plant.  The only succulents that have survived have been in rather deep porcelain/stoneware  bonsai pots with excellent drainage.    My cacti do not seem to grow here although I do see new growth at the crown during the summer. The spines have become much heavier, thicker, more profuse. The Golden Barrel seems to shrink in the winter (dry season) and then re-inflate during the summer monsoon season. The glaucus green body is no longer a perfect smooth green but now has some brownish woody spots from the weather, I guess.  Mealy bugs do not seem to be a problem here at all! In fact, I haven't seen a mealy bug on any plant since I moved here.  My bay tree seems to have a constant problem with scale and then there is the spanish moss.   My Lophocereus Schottii Monstrose is also very slow growing and I wonder if it is struggling. It is in full sun in a deep pot. It should grow faster but I cannot figure out what is ""wrong"". Perhaps the soil for Florida should be rich in peat moss and less sand and pebbles.  I have a very large clump of ??? Mammilaria (grown from seed circa 1987) that has bloomed (never bloomed before I moved here) every spring with very tiny white flowers around the crown. Would love some help identifying the genus and species. It is in a large DEEP pot that sits in my yard and I do nothing except let it be (oh, if the dry season is really dry, I have given it a drink every month or so but other than fertilizing it each fall, nothing. It seems to be very, very happy.   Have wondered if the Lophocereus Schottii Monstrose, Golden Barrel and large clump of Mammillaria??? would do better in the ground but am afraid of losing them.  My adromischus is in a plastic pot with a soil that is mostly peat or spagnum that it came with.  My thinking is that here in Florida, because of the humidity and the daily tropical downpours in the summer, the soil with a lot of rocks in it for good drainage that I used up north is just wrong.  All of my cacti have grown slower since I moved here. Perhaps the growth up north was really due to etiolation and the slow growth here is more like what it should be."

succulents,36x9co,GDTBATH,5,Fri May 22 21:44:37 2015 UTC,That black color is definitely rot. I just propagated a bunch of little leafies and i actually didn't mist at all - just waited for them to grow roots and then watered. Multiple mistings a day is way too much.

I've even read that it's normal for the leaves to get a little wrinkly because they're using the water they've stored. Good luck : )"
succulents,36x9co,Fhwagod,1 point,Fri May 22 22:41:59 2015 UTC,Thanks!
succulents,36x9co,kallan133,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:54:37 2015 UTC,"This is not entirely correct. While succulents go through less water they still have needs. Typically they enjoy having their entire root system soaked through and then letting the soil dry out completely between waterings.  I find they can withstand a rainy day or two in a row as long as the roots have time to dry out soon after. Misting them will generally underwater your plants in the long term.  Over watering will cause rot, which looks like what OP has going on here."
succulents,36x9co,kallan133,3,Sat May 23 03:08:40 2015 UTC,"These are cuttings not plants with established root systems.  I agree with you if he/she had plants that were established.  However, misting cuttings is usually the protocol to get them to root. He/she is having some rot out, which may be due to too much moisture or not letting the cuttings callous before misting.  Sometimes cuttings just die anyway.  Edit:  I try to mist around the cutting and not on the the plant itself."
succulents,36x9co,disneyfacts,1 point,Sat May 23 04:58:14 2015 UTC,Could you explain a bit more about why misting can cause cuttings to rot?
succulents,36x9co,firealot,2,Fri Jun 5 14:54:21 2015 UTC,"It doesn't unless the cuttings weren't calloused or too much water was accumulated and didn't dissipate quickly enough.  I didn't say rooting caused rot in this post, though.  I said it can help induce rooting."

I would put it somewhere protected from more water; if it needs to be stabilized you can add a thin top dressing of pea gravel.  You can also repot but if you do into a bigger pot/with more soil, it'll just retain water even longer.  I might repot into the same pot but just make the potting medium even more drainage-friendly."
succulents,36vdj3,wordsNtricks,2,Fri May 22 12:42:13 2015 UTC,"First is Echeveria, #2 is Sempervivum.  Neither have been receiving enough light, especially #2.  You'll want to acclimate them to more light gradually.  They really prefer some direct sun.  This is what a sempervivum looks like with proper light: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sempervivum_calcareum#/media/File:Sempervivum-calcareum.jpg"
succulents,36vdj3,BackToTheBasic,2,Fri May 22 13:27:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I've had them for a week now. They've got the sunniest spot in my house which gets full sunlight all afternoon.  I'm in a colder climate so I'm not sure if putting them outside during the day would be wise?"
succulents,36vdj3,BackToTheBasic,2,Fri May 22 16:48:27 2015 UTC,Where you have them may be fine.  If they are by a window they will get a fair amount of indirect light as well.  The Sempervivum tend to be one of the most cold-resistant succulents.  You can read up on them and see if outside is an option for you.  The Echeveria will not want to want to be in freezing temps.
succulents,36vdj3,candied_ginger,1 point,Fri May 22 17:44:54 2015 UTC,"What seems bright to your eyes is woefully inadequate to the plants. Most of the usable light is filtered through the window, so indoor succulents suffer if not given a summer break outside. Keep in mind that photosynthesis is how they make their food, so the lack of light is literally starving them.   Importantly, sempervivum is extremely cold tolerant, down to around -40F to even -50F. They don't make good houseplants and would prefer to be outside all year long."
succulents,36vdj3,silchi,1 point,Sat May 23 10:35:41 2015 UTC,"To add to /u/BackToTheBasic - the sepervivum is often known as ""Hens and Chicks"", and it has been the easiest to care for in my collection. They're very drought tolerant, and can take the abuse if you can't get them direct sunlight every day. (I just recently consolidated most of mine from a too-shady spot behind my house to a planter on the patio, and they're finally changing colors with the sun exposure).  They propagate like crazy - you'll have pups everywhere before you know it. They also root easily, so if you want to thin them out, and plant some pups/rosettes elsewhere, they take to a new pot very well."
succulents,36vdj3,silchi,1 point,Fri May 22 14:41:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for the info! I got these a week ago now, and have been introducing them to more sunlight.  Hopefully the spot they're in now will be enough"

succulents,36vwyz,Onixshard,2,Sat May 23 03:14:17 2015 UTC,"My boss brought this in to work living in a sand-filled glass bowl with no drainage or gravel at the bottom. His method of watering it was to sprinkle it very lightly with water every few days. Yes, I know that's all wrong, but I live in a country where it wouldn't have been appropriate to correct him. After it completely died I asked to take it home on the off chance something can be salvaged. I know it's a long shot, but while the outer leaves are rotten and mushy at the base, the roots are actually bone dry. I was thinking his watering method was just getting the top of the plant wet, leading to rot. Is there any chance the roots are still viable? Is it even kind of worth trying to plant them and see what happens?"
succulents,36vwyz,artvegpro,3,Fri May 22 15:25:45 2015 UTC,No harm in trying. I've had whole aloe get wiped out by hard frost and after a good month pups were able to grow out of the previous roots.

I was planning on burying the roots with the dried/dead leaves, still attached, sticking out of the soil. Should I water it thoroughly then leave it alone for a while? Or should I let it stay dry for some time before I water it?"
succulents,36vwyz,disneyfacts,1 point,Fri May 22 15:40:46 2015 UTC,"I think it's a goner.  (Also, it's a Haworthia fasciata in case you want to get a new, living one.)"

succulents,36vwyz,kallan133,7,Fri May 22 15:40:51 2015 UTC,"I think it's actually Haworthia attenuata. It's a very similar species and can easily be confused with fasciata. Another user on here recently told me this, you can tell the difference by the leaf texture. Fasciata will be completely smooth on the top side of the leaf, while attenuata will have some of the white markings or a groove down the middle of the top."

They just seem so tall to me.   Edit: They were sown May 2nd."
succulents,36vuls,tuckedfexas,1 point,Fri May 22 15:07:59 2015 UTC,"I don't have any experience with this species specifically, but they do look like they're too tall. I would try going without the cheese cloth for a couple days and see how they do with the direct sun. Planting them deeper might make them look better, but it won't change their structure and would just be covering up the problem. That might also make them susceptible to rot."

Isn't the change of color mean the plant is sunburned? Is it still healthy when its that color? I'm just curious. I have a couple of aloe pups that I re-potted to their own pots and some are turning pink while others are staying green. I'm not sure if the color change is a good or bad thing.  edit:spelling
succulents,36qjvx,moshinmymellow,2,Thu May 21 14:01:04 2015 UTC,"It is a sign of stress. So it's never better, but I don't think it'll be harmfull. Its not burnt. More like a tan :)  Hope your pups will do great. Colour change is (according to some blogs) no big deal.  Edit: beterbetter"
succulents,36qjvx,abertozz,1 point,Fri May 22 07:06:05 2015 UTC,Color change can just mean that its adjusting to the sunlight. It might be a good warning if your plant isnt ready to able to handle as much sun as Its getting.
succulents,36qjvx,Onadairybasis,2,Sun May 24 16:59:50 2015 UTC,"Stress response! It looks beautiful.  I just read a great blog post about how succulents respond to temperature/water extremes and the difference between a happily stressed plant and a dying plant.    So far as under/overwatering goes, my personal strategy is to keep a popsicle stick in the soil. If you pull the stick out and it still feels at all damp, wait longer to water."

succulents,36pejk,Needle88,1 point,Thu May 21 07:49:00 2015 UTC,It is pretty much deciduous and its more natural for them to go dormate they dont grow at all when dormate. That being said I've seen some keep some leaves threw winter but water was still withheld because risk of rot is high in winter. It's ok to give a little water while dormate to prevent desiccation for me every 4-6 weeks. Sorry about the mix up just saw thorny in the title

succulents,36nicc,msgreyson,3,Wed May 20 17:57:27 2015 UTC,It honestly doesn't look that bad. What is your drainage situation? It might just be having a hard time getting all the water out if it's sitting inside and there is no heat to help the water evaporate. The only thing I can think to tell you is water when the dirt is really dry (you can stick your finger in about two inches to see if it's dry)
succulents,36nicc,jbird18005,1 point,Wed May 20 20:22:00 2015 UTC,It came potted with chunky chunky porous gravel rocks bits. Holes in the bottom of the plastic bowl.

succulents,36nicc,asilli,2,Thu May 21 03:13:57 2015 UTC,I was killing my mixed arrangement by over watering so I just plain old quit watering for 1.5-2 months.

succulents,36m5er,candleAssassin,1 point,Thu May 21 00:18:32 2015 UTC,"I agree. I've seen many succulents grow roots mid-stem and even mid-air when they get leggy. I'm pretty sure it's an extra precaution in case they get top heavy and fall, since that would pull existing roots out. I have one in my collection that was on a dark shelf in the store, so it leans pretty heavily in one direction. It also has roots growing out mid-stem."
