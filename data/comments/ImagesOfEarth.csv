It may be an over shot view of Nevada Falls in Yosemite National Park, but this viewpoint in particular truly means a lot to me. My mom (who raised my two brothers and I all by her self) used to take us to Yosemite just about every year. Every visit, we would make the hike to Nevada Falls and take the John Muir Trail back down to Happy Isles. It seemed that this section of the trail that over looked the falls was always blooming with wildflowers. It was guaranteed that she would stop here and take at least 30 minutes to study and appreciate every single stamen and petal. I couldn't realize it at those moments in time but observing her act that way and be so thrilled about pretty things, shaped me into who I am today. It has influenced every life changing decision I have made since the age of 18.  She still likes to get to Yosemite Valley as often as she can,  but Rheumatoid Arthritis has effectively ended a very long and passionate hiking career. On a recent trip to the Sierras, I made it a personal challenge to capture the grandeur of this special viewpoint for her. I'm just glad the wild flowers were still blooming when we went through.

I really struggled physically during this hike; I'm not really in shape, and we were climbing up to an altitude of ~12,000 miles. I was winded after only a few minutes of walking, much less 8 miles later near the peak!  When my brother and I caught up with my wife and mother-in-law, they were sitting on a rock (in the middle-left of the photo; they are actually in this picture as tiny specks on that rock), admiring the view, waiting for the rest, who had gone ahead to climb all the way up to the peak. Of course.  So, naturally, the skies were darkening as a storm came around the mountain. We were getting antsy. So my brother and I decided that we would go up after the peak-climbers. Because we're smart.  We scrambled up the steepening slope--much steeper than it looks in the photo. It got harder and harder to breathe, and our fear of heights started kicking in. My brother encouraged me to keep going, and so we did, eventually climbing on hands and knees.  We both got too tired and had too much vertigo to keep going, so we plopped down right where we were... and took in the view.    We never made it to the peak, but we were so proud of what we'd done, and so amazed how how beautiful it all was. The storm held off until the way back, which was a pretty miserable affair in and of itself.  But still worth it.  I am a robit"

We ended up going to Mammoth's photo gallery and talking with the manager for quite a while. He recommended to us that we take this ""alternate route"" from our original plan. Right there in the gallery, he printed us some maps and gave us the down low on the area. The detour that added two extra days to the journey ended up being one of the most grand areas of the entire trip.   Nikon D810, 14mm lens, f/13, 1/10' shutter speed.  I am a robit"

Single 1/2"" exposure, Nikon D810, 14mm lens, f/8, 1, 64 ISO.  This evening in particular was one of those moments you couldn't believe what you were witnessing. After hunkering down in a snow storm for the last 5 hours we expected very little for the pending sunset. Just as the golden hour arrived we found ourselves sitting in the eye of the storm. An eerie stillness in the air was accompanied by vibrant blues, pinks, purples, and oranges that ignited the soft fast moving clouds on the horizon.   ""It was the sudden presence of silence that made the evening so surreal. All we had been hearing the last 5 hours was wind howling and blowing snow through our tarp. At one point during the sunset I had to stop shooting, stand up, and just absorb the scene that was unfolding. The intense colors, perfect tranquility, and post storm aroma of snow and dirt truly made me appreciate the special link between nature and the observer."" -Mark www.ourearthinfocus.com  Edit: Thanks for the gold!

ImagesOfEarth,3cw9zi,MultiFunctionBot,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:40:23 2015 UTC,"Here is a link to the original submission  Here is a comment by the original submitter  This is one of my favorite pits in any cave. It is, well, incredible. At 440' from the lip at the top to the floor at the bottom, it is the second longest free hanging rappel in a cave in the contiguous United States. The longest being Fantastic Pit on the other side of the same cave (which can be rigged for up to a 586' drop; the Washington Monument can fit inside Fantastic).   Why I like Incredible Pit so much is the shape. It is like a giant cone seemingly randomly bored out in the limestone.  Access to the pit is difficult.  The only way to get the the bottom is to rappel it or rappel Fantastic Pit and find your way over through the cave. There is no lower entrance. Additionally, the top of Incredible Pit is deep in the cave too, with two large vertical pitches in between it and the entrance. This means that only those experienced with rope work in caves get to see Incredible Pit from either top or bottom.   When rappelling the pit, the rope is rigged right in or near the water as it goes over the lip and so you are in the waterfall most of the way down. Starting off, you are in the middle of what appears to be a vertical tube in the rock. As you rappel down, you pass by layer after layer of limestone and the tube you are in the center of slowly begins to widen out. Eventually it becomes very wide and you finally see the shallow splash pool for the waterfall you will land in. After you get off rope, you can watch the other cavers after you in your group rappel down. Their lights look tiny in the distance when the first get on rope. When everyone is down you can all explore some of the cave at the bottom and then you have to climb out. The 440' climb is exhausting and putting the long and heavy rope out of the pit is just as much so. Because of this, only experienced and fit cavers experience Incredible Pit.   I should emphasize that being experienced with vertical caving (caving with ropework) is a requirement to see Incredible Pit yourself. Because of the waterfall as well as the sheer length of the drop, there is a very real danger of hypothermia also. People have died in Incredible Pit after becoming stuck on rope.  IMO, there is no in-cave pit more awe inspiring than Incredible Pit. Ruby Falls is laughable by comparison.  I am a robit"
