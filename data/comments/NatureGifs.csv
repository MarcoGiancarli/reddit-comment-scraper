NatureGifs,3e3jd6,setthehook,13,Tue Jul 21 18:02:56 2015 UTC,"For people not quite appreciating how hard this is.  Ok, so the fish spits water.  Alright, if its fast enough, there's not much of an arc to it, but either way the fish has to compensate for that.  Ok, that doesn't seem too hard to evolve that, or perhaps the fish learns this over time.  But ... the fishes eyes are under water.  If you've ever looked up at the surface from under water, you know that there is a huge distortion from the refraction that occurs when light switches between air to water.  And this is solved by one and only one way, you have to compensate for Snell's law.  Which needs trigonometry.  So there's a fish that can sub-consciously do 16-17th century human physics.  And they've probably been doing this for longer than we humans have been a separate species from chimpanzees."

Because of this striking pattern, wobbegongs and their close relatives are often referred to as carpet sharks. The camouflage is improved by the presence of small weedlike whisker lobes[1] surrounding the wobbegong's jaw, which help to camouflage it and act as sensory barbs. Wobbegongs make use of their relative invisibility to hide among rocks and catch smaller fish which swim too close, typical of ambush predators."

NatureGifs,3cpxmu,bigrich1776,8,Thu Jul 9 21:53:11 2015 UTC,It looks to me like it's terrified. I'm terrified for it. That worm scares the piss outta me. Apparently it's sneaky as hell too.   It lived for three years in an aquarium unnoticed eating the fish.   http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/10389023/Secret-giant-worm-behind-mystery-of-vanishing-aquarium-fish.html  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eunice_aphroditois

NatureGifs,3brazx,remotectrl,28,Wed Jul 1 14:53:54 2015 UTC,From the title I was expecting the bat to get caught up in the web and the spider to eat it.
NatureGifs,3brazx,kernowgringo,9,Wed Jul 1 15:02:54 2015 UTC,"Me too, and I kept waiting for the shot of the bat on the ground with the spider claiming its prize.  I guess if we were expecting that, the title would say ""bat-hunting spiders"""
NatureGifs,3brazx,george_lass,10,Wed Jul 1 16:01:04 2015 UTC,Could not be a more confusing title. See you on the front page.
NatureGifs,3brazx,schuppaloop,5,Wed Jul 1 16:36:20 2015 UTC,It makes sense to me. [A gif of a] Natterer's bat [that is] hunting spiders.  Edit: did accidentally a woosh?
NatureGifs,3brazx,Veloxio,5,Wed Jul 1 18:23:44 2015 UTC,"Some of us read it as ""Natterer's bat-hunting spiders"" (IE, spiders that hunt bats)."
