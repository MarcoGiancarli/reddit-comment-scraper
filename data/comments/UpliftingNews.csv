I can also pretty much guarantee you that an ethiopian Jew is only similar to an american Jew in religion - their cultural and social experiences are about the same as any americans would be to any ethiopians. While we're at it - the religion itself varies by region too. Culture and social experiences are also far more defined by the region you live than what church/temple you go to once a week (if that).  Unless you count every religion as an ethnicity, Judaism is no different than Christianity. Just because the 1/8 ""Jewish blood"" was good enough for the Nazis to categorize and distinguish Jews as a different race/ethnicity than pure germans doesnt mean they are the ones who get to define what Judaism is."

When you think about the insult used in the past and sadly today that jews have large hooked noses they aren't saying that people who follow that religion have a nose shaped like that but people of a particular ethnic group share that as a physical trait.

UpliftingNews,3e2ahr,Rather_Unfortunate,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:56:19 2015 UTC,"That's increasingly the case now, yes. But for a very long time, Jewish communities tended to keep to themselves to the extent that Ashkenazi Jews of Central Europe (themselves a distinct ethnic group from Sephardi Jews) even developed their own language (Yiddish). They didn't proselytise very much, and Judaism had very little widespread appeal. It would be passed down generation to generation, only rarely moving beyond that. Thus, many Jewish people during the 20th Century and now, even in America can be considered to be a distinct ethnic group.  Nowadays, it's fair to say that that's changed somewhat for some kinds of Judaism. In many instances, Judaism is now more welcoming towards converts of different heritage. But in the specific case of Julius Rosenwald, Wikipedia says he was the son of a Jewish immigrant couple from Germany. It's thus entirely plausible that he was Jewish in both the religious and ethnic sense."
UpliftingNews,3e2ahr,DemosthenesLocke2012,2,Tue Jul 21 17:13:58 2015 UTC,"As a Jew myself, I have head arguments to Judaism naming a religion, an ethnicity/race, and even a nationality (though I'm hesitant with the last one).  Religion: From the wiki, ""A religion is an organized collection of beliefs, cultural systems, and world views that relate humanity to an order of existence."" Of course Judaism fits this one. It is a monotheistic belief system with texts and literal tons of commentary detailing philosophies of life and attempts to answer the ""why's"" of existence.  Anybody can subscribe to this belief system and philosophy and convert to Judaism the religion.  Ethnicity/Race: Jews really were kinda isolated throughout a good chunk of history, considering events as old as the Babylonian Exile, the French Expulsion, the Spanish Inquisition, and as (relatively) recent as the Holocaust. Internally, especially among more observant groups, there is also a sentiment against inter-religious marriage that continues to this day.  The result is a relatively genetically isolated group, as some anecdotal evidence, my grandparents are first generation Polish immigrants, but have more Semetic (i.e. Middle Eastern) features than their former countrymen.  Combined with the fact that ethnicity is determined by personal identification in addition to any physical features (from the wiki: ""An ethnic group or ethnicity is a socially defined category of people who identify with each other based on common ancestral, social, cultural or national experience.""), I can see how it is reasonable to classify Judaism as an ethnicity, and possibly a race.  Note of course that Judaism could encompass multiple ethnicities, such as the difference between Ashkenazi Judaism with Eastern European influences, Sephardic Judaism with Spanish and North African influences, and Ethiopian Judaism.  Nationality: I can see how Judaism started as a nationality, living independently in a kingdom (think Saul, David, Solomon, etc.), or even later as a province of Judea under the Romans. Those kingdoms definitely had their own legal system, outlined in biblical texts.  For the present, as mentioned below, Jews do have a right of return to Israel, a sovereign nation, though obviously there are plenty of Israelis who are not Jewish, and I personally think that equating being a Jew to being an Israeli citizen is a poor precedent to set for tolerance in the region, but I digress.  Overall, I can see how all three of these classifications can apply to Judaism, and individuals can pick and choose which definitions best suit who they are (Are they religious? Do they practice non-religious cultural customs and traditions? Do they feel a nationalistic connection to Israel? Do they ""look"" Jewish?)."
UpliftingNews,3e2ahr,Christabel1991,2,Tue Jul 21 17:21:58 2015 UTC,"Judaism is three things: a religion, an ethnicity and a people.

UpliftingNews,3dylar,myceli-yum,8,Tue Jul 21 00:15:27 2015 UTC,"I'm both a cycling and car enthusiast... I think the perception that cyclists have an attitude problem comes from the fact that they tend to be more vocal compared to other groups. And I think that, in turn, comes from the fact they're in an increased position of vulnerability on the road compared to car users or even motorcycle users. Ergo, if someone does something a bit dangerous they're more likely to take serious, angry exception to it.  Of course, whether or not any of this hypothesis of mine is true, an adversarial approach to other road users, no matter what vehicle they're on/in, is never going to be the safest or most constructive approach. There's a lot of road out there, it's not as if it's fundamentally hard to share it."

All you can do is nod and smile.
UpliftingNews,3dylar,Agent_staple,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:12:37 2015 UTC,"I see this view a lot, but I don't really know how to articulate it without sounding aggressive and putting someone on a defensive.  If you see 500 people performing a certain activity or behaving a certain way and they all wore a green hat, would you ask, ""Why does the green hat change people and make them behave this way?""  Is it the green hat or are you just focusing on a largely meaningless detail?  What I am hoping to convey is, a lot of people do this in a tremendous number of ways.  ""So what?  Whats the big deal?""  Well, this is how ideas like stereotypes are literally formed.  You see a number of people who behave a certain way and many somehow attribute that behaviour, whatever it may be, to something that is visually apparent.  Like saying, ""All black people I've seen did this.  Surely every black people does this and does so because they are black.""  You could change the word black to anything, 13 year olds, cheereleaders, people with blonde hair, women and so on, and hold the same result.    This is the basis on which a lot of bigotry is born.  But if bigotry was born upon this stereotyping notion, pride is it's mortar.    What does it mean, pride?  To be proud of something means that you are, made, have, contain or in some way superior to something else.  It's a sense and form of elevated opinion.  So try to imagine two 'groups' (clicks might be a better word) of people who are basically identical but one or both of these groups are proud of their.  Not only are they aware of one another as clicks or groups, but they think they are better than each other, they are proud of themselves."

UpliftingNews,3dyccr,SillyDodo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:23:49 2015 UTC,"I think there is a general feeling of shame felt collectively by the German people, even those without direct Nazi connections. I studied abroad in Ireland and took a class about the culture, and during one of the lectures we talked about what our own cultures meant to us. There were a few German students, and all of them agreed that they didn't feel they could express their patriotism, not just in another place, but in their own homes; being proud of their German heritage equated to anti-Semitism, Naziism, and racism. We all suffer from the sins of our fathers; they just happen to have had some especially depraved fathers.   Not saying this is true for all German people, just offering some possible insight."

Is it consensus that only those directly responsible for atrocities can atone for the misdeeds?   And finally, if you found out your deceased relative was responsible for, say, the Orangeburg Massacre or the Kent State shootings, would you feel compelled to reach out to victims' families, visit the site, or apologize on behalf of your ancestors' misdeeds?"

Ideally the Dachau guard would have been hanged--and you would not be around to rub in the unfortunate fact that they were not.  Ultimately only the perpetrators of a crime can atone or apologize for their actions.  You can't apologize on behalf of dead people....especially since they were likely not very guilty about their actions....if they truly were, they would have offed themselves."

Not that it matters, but I originally posted this to /r/TrueReddit because my grandparents and father were born pretty much in an identical village on another mountain miles from Sant'Anna, and my Nonna knew some of the children killed. I remember visiting the church and memorial park when I was a teen, and was deeply moved by this horrific story because this could have been my grandmother and my grand-relatives, thereby I wouldn't exist. Although I wasn't personally affected by the massacre, I thought Andreas' outreach was a decent action by someone who seems to be carrying his ancestor's burden.

Lets consider 1000TWh (=1x1015) per year of electricity generation in Japan. The ""even larger project"" of ""92-megawatt"" with ""more than 340,000 modules"", ""expected to generate nearly 100,000 megawatt hours per year"", represents: 100000x106 / 1x1015 = 1x10-4 = 0.01 %. So it would take 100 such ""even larger project"" to replace 1% of what Japan produces. Now, I've counted 2351 golf courses in Japan, so congratulation, we are discussing the potential to replace - one day, at best, with more than 799,340,000 modules (aka future toxic waste) - about 23% of Japan electricity production.

UpliftingNews,3dtptm,hohohoho12,6,Mon Jul 20 00:14:41 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with your math, in fact I applaud it as actual power generated per square foot in solar is very low.   The main factor is the low efficiency of the panels.  Generally running around 16%-20% on a 25 year life span.  Keeping this in mind there are constant improvements in solar (With Tesla r&D involved we may see them faster now).  The efficiency rating keeps going up, as well as add on devices such as micro inverters and dc voltage optimizers.  Over those 25 years price per watt will decline as well as efficiency rising.   Knowing this you'd hope the project engineers spec'd equipment capable of handling the improvements the tech. Otherwise as it stands, solar is mainly good for a source of energy where typical infrastructure does not currently exist.  Namely remote areas and countries that have trouble sourcing material on open market."

UpliftingNews,3dtptm,sanfranidiot,9,Sun Jul 19 17:26:08 2015 UTC,It's all about base load the renewables are a great in theory but fall short of covering our base load in the United States. I work on Extra High Voltage Systems (which is the main way your power gets transferred) the biggest worry about shutting down nuclear plants is the reality that brown outs could potentially happen because our potential base load for power would be greatly reduced. Nuclear is the future we need to find ways to make it the safest and most cost effective technology. I think incidents like Chernobyl and Three Mile Island leave a bad taste in everyone's mouth but we need to move o. and use some real R & D money on this technology.
UpliftingNews,3dtptm,Maxsablosky,2,Sun Jul 19 17:52:54 2015 UTC,"I also hate when people talk as if electric or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are a solution to our fossil fuel dependancy. Electric/Hydrogen vehicles are alternitives to our reliance on fossil fuels as a portable and reliable fuel but are no way alternitives to our use of fossil fuels as energy sources.   The direct comparison of electricity/hydrogen vs gasoline ignores the source of that electricity/hydrogen. As pointed out in this thread our current demand for electricity can only met through traditional sources (oil, coal, nuclear). Hydrogen is obtained (on Earth) via extraction from water and requires a lot of energy/electricity to break the Hydrogen-Oxygen bond.  Of course finding an alternative renewable energy source is the goal but is much further away than a lot of people seem to realize. The reality is at this point in time alternitve energy sources can't met our current demands. What bridge do we want to use to get there, fossil fuel or nuclear? Effectively, making a stance against nuclear equivalent to a stance promoting fossil fuel."

UpliftingNews,3dtptm,dzikraa,2,Sun Jul 19 21:25:30 2015 UTC,"there are true but Im afraid that it become misleading if we didnt give a context for comparison.   pv power plant is not meant to be used as total replacement of conventional power plant, at least for now. It only serve as a peakers for noon peak load where for base load, we still need flat power plant like coal, nuclear or gas. To make it into context, compare pv power plant with other power plant that designed for peaker purpose. For example : hydroelectric peakers  FYI, open cycle hydroelectric peakers is even worse than pv plant. It goes around 13-16% of capacity factor just like pv plant, but requires 3-4 more land space to produce the same installed capacity compared with pv plant.   if we assume that pv power plant is unsuitable for now by giving those calculation above, hydroelectric peakers will be even worse. but in reality, it is feasible"

People are just fooled because overweight people can play well sometimes, but that doesn't mean they aren't athletic, it means that multiple body types can succeed.  No, it is not cardio intensive most of the time, but it uses every muscle group and requires immense skill and stamina. Even if you disagree with this analysis, golf is about the most healthy activity for an average person. I play tennis every day, hard, but one round golf (walking) burns twice as many calories, and has a very low risk of injury.  The only problem with golf is time. It takes a lot of time to become proficient enough to enjoy (years usually even starting as a five year old), and it takes a very long time to play relative to other activities."

UpliftingNews,3dq4q1,petite-vest,65,Sun Jul 19 04:06:05 2015 UTC,"Doesn't surprise me a bit. A large proportion of teachers do it because they believe in what they're doing. It's not about the money and a lot of the time, including in the US where many schools are under-funded, they pay out of their own pocket for supplies and whatnot.  Personally, I don't get it. In this day and age, aside from the nordic countries and a handful of countries in Asia, education takes a back seat to many things. We're doing it all wrong.  To paraphrase Sam Seaborn (played by Rob Lowe) in the first season of The West Wing: ""Education is the silver bullet. Education is everything. We don't need little changes. We need gigantic revolutionary changes. . . . Competition for the best teachers should be fierce. They should be getting six-figure salaries. Schools should be incredibly expensive for government and absolutely free of charge for its citizens, just like national defense.""

UpliftingNews,3dq4q1,gelinrefira,14,Sat Jul 18 17:13:43 2015 UTC,"Somebody a while back explained that the reason you can pay teachers so little is because so many people are willing to teach.  Some decide to teach so they can have summer breaks, some teach because they can't do anything else with their degree, and some teach because they actually want to make a difference.  But a lot of times those new teachers each year get burnt out because of low pay, poor funding, and issues with their students or the administration.  So they leave after a year or two, and you get a new set of hopefuls that take the job because they think the benefits will outweigh any stress that comes with the job (including a small paycheck).    It's sad that teachers get treated about as well as fast food workers by a lot of administrators.  They don't need to invest in teachers because they can always replace them when the going gets tough (in districts without good tenure practice, of course).  As long as you can guarantee that at least a handful of new college grads in your school district will try and sign up for a teaching job in your school every couple of years, why would you offer them a decent salary when they can be easily and quickly replaced?"

UpliftingNews,3dq4q1,hitlerosexual,13,Sat Jul 18 22:43:40 2015 UTC,"Sorry but no.  Teachers are great and they should get paid more, but let's not get out of hand.    Doctors have several years of the hardest schooling, which is the most competitive to get into.  After that they get the pleasure of their residency which is another several years of total stress, all to be qualified.  And they need this qualification because they are tasked with making life and death decisions every day.  The stress of that alone is hard to put a price on.

UpliftingNews,3dq4q1,biggyofmt,12,Sun Jul 19 01:10:37 2015 UTC,"I guess you have a point there, but still teachers are responsible for helping to create the doctors of tomorrow, and if they're underpaid then they have less motivation to give a shit. I'd say $80,000 a year would be good."

I've seen teachers put in work that, by the end of their careers, equal well more than 12 years of schooling by the end of it all.   They accept responsibility for the most precious thing in your life and spend their own money loving them and preparing them for an ugly world. I've had teachers literally drive to my house and speak with my parents when I was messing up in school. Teachers are a treasure and they deserve to be compensated as such.

People seem to think that CPS (Child Protective Services) will swoop in and take away kids if there is the slightest sign of neglect and abuse. That's not what I have observed as a teacher. You make the call, but usually very little is done about it, no matter how horrible the home life of the child is.  Edit: I'm sorry, this isn't very uplifting."
UpliftingNews,3dq4q1,Skeenip,2,Sun Jul 19 00:17:11 2015 UTC,"I don't mean to sound accusatory so sorry if I come off that way.   Part of the problem here is that in most states CPS has a host of things set up against them in removal of kids.   Not enough beds. There are a metric fuckton of kids in the system and nowhere close to enough foster homes, temp housing, or residential living facilities. You really don't want to send kids to residential unless they already have issues. Residential centers tend to take care of kids with bigger issues. Most places CPS doesn't have near as much say in what happens as people suspect. They might emergency take some kids on Friday and have to send them home come Monday night because a judge has ruled they should go home. Like when the case didn't meet that judges standard for neglect or they find that there is no neglect.   -A lot of case workers are have too many cases. I have a lot of friends who are social workers (who live in multiple states) who are working with anywhere from 1 to 6 extra cases. Most states have standards and laws about how many cases a social worker can watch over. In my state that number is 20 and of the 3 workers I know here  2 have 3 extra, and 1 has 2.  I am not saying there aren't shitty workers as we all see it in the news. I am just saying that they are working within a system, in a job that is increasingly being privatized (along with a lowering in pay), having to see horrible things like kids who have had boiling water poured on them as punishment, having people want to murder you (and there are cases of parents murdering case workers), and being the end of the line when it comes to blame... it is just a shitty, hard job, with long hours, and low respect."

Even if you have kids of your own,you don't spend that much time with them after school and before bed. This is an extremely nice gesture and gift. She obviously loves her work. Yes here in Australia it's very unusually cold this winter and we aren't used to it. It's also raining quite frequently and the chill in the air is worse. It's normally around 5-6 deg Celsius (41 F) in the mornings now at school time. I agree with Karma comments."

A Primary school teacher who wanted to buy all the kids in her school a pair of shoes to help them through winter, she seems like a nice woman. She was on the Today show today and Blundstone (major shoe manufacture in aust) saw what she was trying to do and donated a shit load of shoes/boots on her behalf. So I'm not even sure if her prize money is going to the kids now that Blundstone are stepping in with the corporate karma points. Also, she actually answered the question wrong and Eddie, the host, basically told her to have another try with 2 seconds on the clock because she had stated her intent beforehand if she did win the money."

UpliftingNews,3dq4q1,Noticemenot,7,Sun Jul 19 08:17:26 2015 UTC,"She might be in a low income area.  My sister recently told me her most cherished childhood memory and how it changed looking back on it as an adult.    My parents had seven kids,  and could easily afford it.  My dad was in a good industry with plenty of job security.  However shortly after 9/11 his company laid him off with little warning .    That winter my sister was called into the office at school and my mom was there with a new pair of boots.  She said as a child it was an amazing surprise to have me boots that fit and didn't leak.   As an adult she realised the school called my mom and told her my sister needed new boots and my mom had to scrape money together to get them.  My sister had been wearing my boots from two years prior.  They were tight and leaky.   Some kids families simply may not have the funds,  or it could take the burden off families.  Either way it's a kind gesture to provide sturdy foot wear to them during the cold winter months."
UpliftingNews,3dq4q1,VagCookie,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:29:37 2015 UTC,I have 3 kids of my own and even in a public school there are ongoing costs to excursions and some books etc. Shoes are what you need (and uniform) to buy kids frequently because they grow so quickly and it's costly to but good shoes every 4 or 5 months. Many are single parents would find it more difficult. Most kids wear them out quicker than adults because they are so active so I think that was money well spent.

There's also the fact your putting a fake burden on the nurse there.  It's cruel to dangle a biscuit in front of a dog for example, when they want and can't reach it correct?"

UpliftingNews,3doofq,VagCookie,5,Sat Jul 18 04:26:53 2015 UTC,"People here are failing to realise what marriage means to a four year old.  When I was four I wanted to marry my big brother.  Why? Because my parents said you marry who you love the most in the whole world.  Someone who will protect you and take care of you.  My brother fit that idea when I was four.   At the time I had no concept of what adult marriage was.  No concept of sex.  No concept of attraction.  I was four. My little brother wanted to marry my mother when he was five. My sister wanted to marry her teacher when she was 8. All of this based on a child's understanding of love and marriage.  That being it is something you do with someone you love the most, who you want to protect and be protected by.    I think it's sweet.  Btw at four I wanted to be a dog or a princess."

UpliftingNews,3dlxkv,JohnnyOnslaught,20,Fri Jul 17 14:36:14 2015 UTC,"Having been to both of these places several times I thought I'd chip in my two cents.  I think you're both right.  They're just different kinds of bad.  East Hastings in Vancouver is like stepping into another world.  There are tightly packed crowds of grungy, hungry, homeless people, but not desperate.  It's its own dedicated community, a small town almost, except its nestled on street level beneath enormous skyrises.  Hamilton felt to me, more dangerous.  It might have been because of the areas I was visiting, but people didn't just seem down on their luck, they seemed hopeless. Tired. And vocal about it.  For me, Hamilton was a midway stop between Toronto and Niagra Falls, a transitional place when going from A to B.  East Hastings in Vancouver felt to me more like the destination. If you're homeless in BC, there isn't a much better place to be."

UpliftingNews,3dlxkv,moomooshooz,2,Sat Jul 18 02:00:54 2015 UTC,"Simple fact is prohibition doesn't work. Look at the number of people that get arrested for drug offenses and continue doing drugs in jail. We can't even keep the drugs out of the fucking locked cages!  Even ""Krokodil"", which is pretty much the poster child for ""this should be illegal"" would benefit from being legal and regulated. Desomorphine itself does not cause the horrible decomposition that you see from krokodil users - it's the chemicals they use to process it and make no attempt to remove when they're making it in back alleyways. A lot of the damage comes from poor injections which basically results in iodine and phosphorus filled abscesses under the skin which are left to eat their way out of you.  If it were legal and regulated, you could, y'know, stop people from selling it when it's still full of iodine and phosphorus. You could also have safe injection sites where people who knew what the fuck they were doing could help administer the drugs to prevent a lot of the harmful side effects of poor injections. People who had medical issues related to the drug could seek medical treatment without risking jail and maybe get the problems dealt with before their leg was rotting off.  This is not to mention that the only reason people are doing krokodil in the first place is because it's a poor man's opiate. Do you know what it costs to legally purchase cocaine and opiates? Fuck all. Your local hospital is buying the stuff by the truck full for pennies because it doesn't have to be shipped halfway across the world in some guy's rectum. If the every man could purchase from the same supplier, the demand for shitty street brewed desomorphine would dry up overnight.  Point to a horrendous drug, and I'll point out that people are doing it anyway. We're not going to be able to stop them, so we may as well make it as safe as possible."
UpliftingNews,3dlxkv,0x1107D5EB5B5BA4D7C6,0,Sat Jul 18 04:29:35 2015 UTC,"Bromo-DragonFLY?   Largely harmless.   PCP?   Functionally identical to OTC cough syrup.   MPTP or other shit drugs?    ""Truth in labeling"" is a lot easier to enforce with decrim.   Krokodil?   Harmless aside from being an opiate.  Like ""MPTP in the designer opiates,"" the only medical issues with desomorphine (""crokodil"") are with adulterants left in the product.  Regulate!"
UpliftingNews,3dlxkv,esoterictree,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:15:51 2015 UTC,I actually am on the fence about hard drugs being legal just because they are so bad. But I'd like somewhere to actually legalize all drugs so we can see whether the effects are as bad to society as they are now.
UpliftingNews,3dlxkv,tikki_rox,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:41:11 2015 UTC,What about decriminalizing possession up to a certain amount but make it illegal to sell?
UpliftingNews,3dlxkv,codemonkey010,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:42:21 2015 UTC,Fine by me. It's a start.
UpliftingNews,3dlxkv,tikki_rox,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:18:33 2015 UTC,"Simple fact is that, legal or not, people are going to do them.  If they're legal and regulated, you can at least make sure that the people doing cocaine are actually doing cocaine, not a bit of cocaine cut with drain cleaner or something. You can give the heroin addicts clean needles to reduce the risk of spreading hepatitis or HIV. Addicts can seek medical treatment or rehabilitation without risking jail time.  If it's legal and regulated, instead of people doing shitty street brewed desomorphine that eats your skin off of your bones, they could buy pharmaceutical grade opiates for a fraction of the price and get the same effect safely.  However bad you think the drugs are, pushing them into back alleys and the hands of criminals is only ever going to make the situation worse... And that's all you're doing. Making them illegal does not make them go away. If you need any evidence of this, just look at alcohol prohibition."

UpliftingNews,3dia3e,Freak913,8,Thu Jul 16 18:01:08 2015 UTC,I imagine there could still be a danger of getting glass on the baby if they break the driver's window and the baby's in the passenger seat. The force needed to smash the glass would likely send it flying across the front seats. Breaking the back window is likely to be the safest option.
UpliftingNews,3dia3e,TurdFerguson812,14,Thu Jul 16 18:52:09 2015 UTC,"Firefighter here.  Best tool for the job of breaking a car window (other than the front windshield): spring loaded center punch.  Don't know about the cops, but we all carry those.  Funny story that happened to me.  Car on fire, windows still up and haven't broken from the heat yet.  Captain tells a very young and eager me to break the side windows of the car.  Lots of bystanders watching.  I decide to use the tool I happen to be holding, a 6' pike pole (like this).  First swing...thud...nothing.  Second swing...thud, nothing.  People are starting to laugh, you get the idea.  By the time I finally broke the window, I was swinging that pike pole like Mark McGuire.     TL;DR: Car windows are hard to break"
UpliftingNews,3dia3e,Freak913,6,Thu Jul 16 19:33:12 2015 UTC,Nifty! Does it stop the glass from shattering all over the place?
UpliftingNews,3dia3e,TurdFerguson812,12,Thu Jul 16 19:35:20 2015 UTC,"The center punch does keep the glass flying factor to a minimum...you aren't swinging something against the window, you just have to kind of press the punch against the glass.  Glass usually shatters and falls straight down, as opposed to going flying into the car."

UpliftingNews,3dia3e,Amphibialrabies69,2,Fri Jul 17 00:26:40 2015 UTC,"We had that problem as part of our practical testing. Had to get into a car, had no punch so I decided a nice hit from the halogen would do the trick. Didn't work the first few times, tried a big baseball hit, still nothing. We did find that the sweet spot was the bottom corners of the windows though as it only took a couple swings there."
UpliftingNews,3dia3e,poormagic,2,Thu Jul 16 22:30:10 2015 UTC,For real? The pick end on a well maintained halogen or pick head does the trick for me.
UpliftingNews,3dia3e,MKEman,2,Fri Jul 17 06:37:43 2015 UTC,Not much force is needed if you use the right glass breaking tools. I could see them safely breaking the glass without harming the kid.
UpliftingNews,3dia3e,poormagic,2,Thu Jul 16 19:35:36 2015 UTC,They are safety glass. They mostly crumble when broken. They also are less expensive than that tiny window. If given the option anyone breaking the window out should break a window that rolls up or down (usually). If you have something hard like a ceramic coffee mug that will do the trick. Also striking in a corner helps. The windows flex less at those points and therefore absorb less of the impact.
UpliftingNews,3dia3e,AngeloM4141,20,Fri Jul 17 06:44:23 2015 UTC,Police do all the work. Batman gets the praise. Same old story.

Nobody had to be a dick to even set up the situation where this kid ended up being a hero. The grandparents weren't at fault, the car locked itself, they didn't leave the kid locked in the car; the police weren't slow to respond and didn't do anything reckless. It was just once of those funny scenarios - and I can't get the grin off my face. Props to you kid :D"

With my keys still in the bag.  Should be fine, right?  I'll just walk around to the driver's door and pop the trunk release switch.  And then a loud BEEP and muted clunk as the car locked.  Itself.

I've seen this happen and witnessed myself almost make the same mistake before realizing this.  Strangers have even less consideration, and consider the person an object of change rather than a real person with experiences and psychology and limits. They don't see their troubles and therefore can't understand their motives.   Strangers can take a selfless martyr-esque act and make it seem deplorable for no reason other than that ""it wasn't selfless enough"".

UpliftingNews,3derzw,mazu747,10,Thu Jul 16 03:14:16 2015 UTC,"Reddit (in general) has a problem with anyone who isn't a relativist or anti-theist. Many of these intolerant people go looking for subs of various beliefs they disagree with and blanket downvote posts. It's so bad some subs have had to go restricted and private just to stop the karma bombing.   For lacking religion, many of these people are more zealous and religious about their beliefs than the religious people they self-righteously mock."
UpliftingNews,3derzw,childofnewlight,6,Thu Jul 16 03:57:11 2015 UTC,"I'm Jewish and I see comments and posts on reddit that I think are antisemitic, but I don't think it's a problem that reddit has. We're an easily misunderstood people. We've maintained a strong national identity through two millennia of exile which has often placed is in a position where our values don't sync with some social standards. We do things differently, which someone rubs people the wrong way. I don't apologize for it because we're maintaining values that are meant to being peace to the world.   Anyway, it's not just on reddit. People on reddit are expressing concerns that are shared by a lot of people. The only difference is that on reddit people don't have to be careful of social graces. If you don't like something and aren't open to discussing it further, you can post an angry comment or rant. Maybe people will read it, maybe not, but it's out there. Without an in depth discussion, the person may not know that they're misunderstanding or hearing only one side of the story."

UpliftingNews,3derzw,Megneous,17,Wed Jul 15 22:21:42 2015 UTC,"Also a default moderator here. You're misunderstanding something very important about Redditors complaining about censorship.  They're complaining about the Reddit admins interfering with subreddits and banning entire subreddits/opinions. They are not complaining about mods upholding the preestablished rules of their own subreddits. That has always been that way, and keeping a community on topic and respectful has always been a welcomed ""censorship"" by the majority of the userbase because they acknowledge that some maintaining is in order to keep every subreddit from devolving into easily digested, low effort content... or worse, become /r/spacedicks.  A moderator keeping comments within the rules of the subreddit and admins, or worse, business people deciding what subreddits are and aren't ok based on their own opinions rather than law- these are very different situations. Users are complaining about the latter."

UpliftingNews,3derzw,RagingMayo,11,Wed Jul 15 21:59:08 2015 UTC,"Well, the owners of Reddit aren't obliged to hold onto free speech. Reddit is a company like any other and they can decide which content they want to see on their platform. Surely this doesn't appeal to anyone, but the guys at Reddit aren't breaking any US-law (tell me, if I am mistaken). People can now decide whether they want to follow this trend or walk over to other services, the currenlty most popular one being voat.co (while it is not down due DDOS or simple overload of users). Personally, I am very much for the ban of subreddits like /r/fatpeoplehate because they were overstepping their limits by brigading against individuals. We have seen this community's (and actually a part of reddit's) maturity, when they were creating troll subreddits all over the website making fun of Ellen Pao as the next Adolf Hitler. I am totally ok, if those people with their toxic, immature behaviour wander off to other websites."

He is helping christians because it was Quakers and other christian denominations like them who funded the kinder-transports( imagine underground railroad for jews that helped thousands of Jewish children escape Nazi Germany and who later adopted the children helping raise many of them who were to become orphans as hitler's final solution became implemented) which he was extremely fortunate to have been on.  “I can’t save the world, but there is a very specific possibility on the Christian side. Let others do what they like for the Muslims.”  He's referring to the fact that there are millions of Muslims and not that many Christians. There are millions of people who are more then able who can help the Muslims including you know 1.2 billion Muslims, along with 22 arab states in the immediate vicinity, but it's out of his capability to help them along with christian's. the Christians do not have any allies, the western world is not coming to save them.

UpliftingNews,3derzw,Rekuja,46,Thu Jul 16 03:47:39 2015 UTC,"Syrians are from Syria, mostly Muslim.  Assyrians are from Ancient North Iraq, mostly, if not all... Christians.  Syrians have a country.  Assyrians don't."
UpliftingNews,3derzw,Thatzionoverthere,3,Wed Jul 15 21:14:54 2015 UTC,"Not exactly. Assyrians are an ethnic group deriving from the ancient assyrian empire which controlled all of iraq, syria,lebanon and other parts of the region. Syria is basically the homeland of assyrians, i believe syria derives from Assyrian. Most syrians are muslim arabs who arrived during the islamic crusades. Assyrians have been there since the beginning but they're now a minority."
UpliftingNews,3derzw,Yasu3,13,Wed Jul 15 20:26:58 2015 UTC,"Syria is basically the homeland of assyrians   Nope. Only North Western Syria (Hasaka Province), Northern Iraq(Nineweh and the KRG, and NW Iran and South Eastern Turkey are Assyria. Anything else is a result of Ancient Imperial expansion.   Most syrians are muslim arabs who arrived during the islamic crusades   Most Syrians are of mixed stock. Syrian Arabs as we know today were not from one particularly area. They are not fully Arab.  That said Syria was dare i say half-Arab before Islam. Arabs since their inception (or at the very least their earliest attestation; Qedarites, Gindibu, etc.) were already in and self-ruing in Syria. From Gindibu in 870BCE to 631AD before Mohammad's invasion various Arab dynasties rules parts of Syria.   Assyrians have been there since the beginning but they're now a minority.   I love how you blame this on Arabs. No area were Arabs live in Iraq for example pre-Iraqi and pre-Syrian (neo)-Ba'ath did not already have Arabs before Islam. Only Northern Iraq and NW Syria was Assyrian. Today it is not Arabs living there but Kurds. Today it is not Arabs ruling Edessa(now Sanliurfa) or Urmia or ""Hawler""(aka Irbil by Assurians) but Turks and Persians and Kurds. Look at Seyfo, done by Turks and Kurds.  Assyrians never actually lived in considerable amounts outsdie of the above. The lived in an Empire. The bulk of their empire was not Assyrian."
UpliftingNews,3derzw,Thatzionoverthere,3,Wed Jul 15 22:21:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the clarifications. I always assumed due to the ruins and the simple fact that most assyrians still lived in syria that it was just the remnant of their former empire in their heartland much like turkey would be the remnant of the ottoman empire.   Edit: was not blaming this on arabs, i assumed that arabs who are the majority, since most islamized people in the middle-east are arab or self identify as arab even if they're actually berber like libyans still consider themselves arab. Also are we referring to just homeland? because i referring to all their territory historically."
UpliftingNews,3derzw,Yasu3,4,Wed Jul 15 22:29:08 2015 UTC,I understand why you'd think that. It is easy to assume Assyrians in places today derive for the Assyrian Empires expansion. For example there is an Assyrian 'quarter' in Jerusalem. But these Assyrians came to Jerusalem in the late 100's after converting to Christianity and not from the Assyrian settlers who invaded and occupied Israel/Judah in the 900-700 BCE (the later were al absorbed by the Aramaeans and Jews/Samaritans)

We're both the remnants of the original Near Eastern, Semitic culture that has many times fallen under the threat of extinction, ever since that centuries-old process of Islamization and Arabization began through conquest. Did you know that in Judaism, the Aramaic language is a sacred language (lashon qodesh) like Hebrew?  Neither do I see any reason to hate the State of Israel. Wouldn't you too want to have a state of your own, somewhere in modern-day Iraq/Mesopotamia?"
UpliftingNews,3derzw,Yasu3,3,Wed Jul 15 23:01:48 2015 UTC,"Arabization    Last I checked Arabs did not control Assyrian land. It was Turks, Persians and mostly Kurds. Stop whining about Arabization and look at the Kurdification happening as we speak. Last i checked it was Turks and kurds who waged Seyfo.

He was hit by the Germans, with shrapnel ripping through his upper arm and his knee cap was blown off.  He survived by seeking shelter in the frigid snow, underneath a burning tank.   During his recovery in the hospital, my grandfather was so eager to see his wife, he sneaked away from his hospital bed, to spend the night in her hotel room.

UpliftingNews,3dbcex,jaayyne,48,Wed Jul 15 06:05:35 2015 UTC,"It's 2:30 AM and I'm getting all misty-eyed over people writing letters to trees.   Goodnight, Reddit."
UpliftingNews,3dbcex,Syncopian,12,Wed Jul 15 06:07:43 2015 UTC,Right? We sure can be incredible sometimes.
UpliftingNews,3dbcex,dactyif,2,Wed Jul 15 06:14:21 2015 UTC,At linking content that is.
UpliftingNews,3dbcex,Tuberomix,19,Wed Jul 15 06:22:10 2015 UTC,My absolute favorite part is that this project required them to number every single tree. Those letters in the article are to trees numbered in the millions. Some people had the job of walking around and counting over a million trees. That's an incredible job.
UpliftingNews,3dbcex,deputybadass,17,Wed Jul 15 13:43:05 2015 UTC,"Those jobs already exist (at least here in Holland). Tree's are counted, monitored and tracked for a lot of reasons. It's handy for the city to know what trees and how their condition is. The guy counting the trees would also make notes if the trees need to be trimmed, if roads near the trees need repairs or spot if trees are sick. This data is also need to asses green maintenance costs.  Some jobs also entail counting birds, animals and assessing the state of waterways."
UpliftingNews,3dbcex,Spoooooooooooooky,5,Wed Jul 15 06:34:32 2015 UTC,"There are most definitely not over a million trees in the city of Melbourne council district. Go to the website and you can see a map of where they all are  Edit: thought I should add that yeah that's still a pretty awesome job to have! I checked and it says there's over 70,000. Must have taken some time..."

UpliftingNews,3dbcex,periander,22,Wed Jul 15 04:35:32 2015 UTC,"Why vote Libs at all? It's not like Tony is the driving force of the party, he still represents their interests overall and everything Tony does is something the Libs are doing.   You can change the leader but it'll just be a new face on the same piece of shit. Just vote for an independent or third party instead of throwing it away."
UpliftingNews,3dbcex,Deceptichum,8,Wed Jul 15 08:39:33 2015 UTC,People should leave this branch of the council alone.
UpliftingNews,3dbcex,nutcrackr,5,Wed Jul 15 08:45:28 2015 UTC,"Trees are awesome. We literally wouldn't have anything today in modern society without trees. When we started out as humans we had this material lying all over the place which you can use to start a fire, which you can burn, which you can heat up and make into charcoal to forge metal, which we can use for heat and light, and we can use for tools and building material.    If trees didn't exist, and you made them up in a book, people would say it's unrealistically overpowered."
UpliftingNews,3dbcex,3226,6,Wed Jul 15 09:17:59 2015 UTC,But now what are they going to do when something is actually wrong with the tree? The inbox will be so full of love letters no one will notice and fix the problem

Notice they don't mention how many hours he was working (I think ""9-5"" is probably a bit of a misnomer employed to just describe a corporate job, not necessarily how many hours he worked every week). I don't know many people that make a shit ton that work ""only"" 40 hours a week. Additionally, it says ""up to $20K a month"".

UpliftingNews,3de8du,gladudontknowme,8,Wed Jul 15 19:53:42 2015 UTC,"Eh, he made 1,000,000 over 3 years split between 5 people.  While I would like to think he actually accomplished something, all he did was make a website and get add revenue...  Getting add revenue for something is basically the same thing as getting paid by someone, just with more harmful economic effects.."
UpliftingNews,3de8du,oNodrak,3,Wed Jul 15 19:14:22 2015 UTC,"You make some good points. But I would add he is making that money mostly on his own terms. It also sounds like, due to his increased freedom, he's been able to parlay those earnings to investment capital, which is key. He also made a smart move by buying property, namely in Asia where it's a lot cheaper to live. When you work paycheck to paycheck it's a little harder to set aside money for investments.   Why would you say ad revenue has more harmful economic effects though?"
UpliftingNews,3de8du,Osceana,3,Wed Jul 15 19:34:21 2015 UTC,"1 mil over 3 years, no mentions of profits. Having revenue doesn't mean you are profiting."
UpliftingNews,3de8du,gladudontknowme,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:54:56 2015 UTC,"Companies are run based on revenues not profits.   What???? Um no. Having revenue is nice, but if you have no profits then you are fiscally running the company into the ground. Some industries you can expect to operate at a loss for a certain time frame but over a long enough time if you are not bringing in more revenue than you have in cost then you are not operating a successful business.   In the eyes of an outside investor a small company's worth that has minimal amount of assets and liability is based on a fairly straight forward equation of Value=(annual revenue- annual cost) multiplied by 3 to 4 depending on how much you can milk that investor.  So if you profit 100k a year, then your company is worth about 350k from an outside perspective.  if you have revenue of $1,000,000 and cost of $1,200,000 annually, then your company has a value of 0$."

UpliftingNews,3de8du,ace425,2,Wed Jul 15 17:15:29 2015 UTC,"Wordpress or blogspot I assume. And monetizing is usually done through google adsense, though any pay-per-click network would work. It all depends on traffic to your blog. Don't expect to make any money for a long time."
UpliftingNews,3de8du,Goldmedal_,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:37:31 2015 UTC,/u/Goldmedal_ has the right idea. You can also just buy your own domain and publish the blog there. There are definitely a lot of free tools you could use to make a simple blog template. It would probably be easier to gain revenue that way. You can run Google Analytics and use the stats to leverage greater ad revenue.
UpliftingNews,3de8du,Osceana,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:26:10 2015 UTC,"As to where to go, I'm not sure. However monetization comes from popularity. Increased web traffic you can add subtle ads or get donations from your fans have sponsorships that sort of deal."

Easy access to pretty much the entirety of human knowledge is only becoming more and more crucial.  For children growing up in poor areas, not having access to the Internet and continuous experience with technology is yet another huge obstacle to overcome in an effort to end the cycle of poverty. It's 2015... If there are large chunks of the population who do not have access, let's all help them out.   I believe the Internet to be a powerful tool for advancing humanity towards more peace. if we parachuted into North Korea a million smartphones and blanketed the area in free wifi, I bet North Korea would see revolution that would result in positive change.   Knowledge is power. An open Internet breaks down the old systems of control. But the key is getting everyone access."

She slept on the ground in the middle of the jungle with all the noises of animals around her.    Because of her poor eyesight she often thought there already were some huts at a river bend but it was only a rock or some trees. This had to be an unbelieveable disappointment each time.

UpliftingNews,3d8ir1,anargumentclinic,25,Tue Jul 14 14:45:11 2015 UTC,"I thought you were supposed to do the exact opposite of this when walking in bear territory? Making noises (eg. jangly things like keys, talking loudly, etc) will more often scare any bears away well before you get anywhere near them - rather than being quite and potentially startling one nearby which may then attack."
UpliftingNews,3d8ir1,alphagammabeta1548,36,Tue Jul 14 14:19:41 2015 UTC,"Depends on the bears.  Black bears and brown bears tend to be more timid.  The ones that run wild tend to already fear humans, so the trick is to make noise and alert them because the only way they will attack is if they feel threatened, say if you walk up on a mom with cubs.  (Or rarely if they are very hungry)  If they hear you coming, you'll be safe.  But if you run into a grizzly bear (brown but with golden and grey tips)... Regular bears tend to feed on smaller mammals, but grizzlys feed on moose, elk, caribou and even black bears.  So humans are about the right size for their prey.  They don't actually hunt humans, but they won't run from a fight necessarily.  Given that they weigh up to 360kg (800 lbs) and their bite is strong enough to crush a bowling ball, they don't usually need to run.    Anyway, if you run across a grizzly, your best bet is to to leave the area immediately and hope they aren't hungry.  Grizzly bears are also one of the few bears that can't climb trees, so that's always an option."
UpliftingNews,3d8ir1,anargumentclinic,42,Tue Jul 14 14:26:32 2015 UTC,"Grizzly bears, God's way of saying ""No, I really don't want you to escape the wilderness alive"""
UpliftingNews,3d8ir1,anytimeyoulike,16,Tue Jul 14 14:50:14 2015 UTC,"Actually, all bears are pretty safe.  Most bears will flee you, and even grizzlies will only attack if you have horrible luck/timing... Just leaving the area immediately will keep you safe.  But leaving the area immediately is key.  If an animal or it's young are threatened, it can quickly become ferocious.  That's why most of the 'bear attacks' you hear about are because of dumb shits like these who decide an adult bear is a photo opportunity.  (The reason I'm putting this in uplifting news is to emphasize that one does not need to fear bear attacks if one behaves intelligently.)"
UpliftingNews,3d8ir1,earlierson,19,Tue Jul 14 15:06:26 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify for everyone: There's no taxonomic difference between a grizzly bear and a brown bear. They are two different names for the same species.     ""Brown bears"" are typically said to eat a lot of salmon and be larger than ""grizzlies"", while grizzlies look more grizzled and stay inland, eating deer and such. But there is no difference other than behaviour and eating habits. It's like comparing an overweight person who eats a lot of fish to an slim person who eats red meat."

For a loaded 777 over open water like MH-370, absolutely, let's track them at all times, but 3 people in a Beechcraft Bonanza?

UpliftingNews,3d8ir1,ShitShyShoes,4,Tue Jul 14 23:42:00 2015 UTC,"Anyone out there have any advice on how to survive in a situation like this? Is it better that you just stay put, build a shelter and make a fire - or should you try to make your way out?  And I remember some tips, like marking your positions as you go with an arrow pointing in the direction you're going. And if you encounter a large river it's always best to go.... upstream?"
UpliftingNews,3d8ir1,avidiax,11,Wed Jul 15 02:49:25 2015 UTC,"Where she was? Tough. In general, staying put is the best idea. This time of year, it is a toss-up though. It can get fairly hot, even in the mountains, so dehydration is a real fear. It can also get downright cold at night, especially in the mountains, so exposure is also an issue.  However, if you absolutely feel you HAVE to move out for whatever reason, several things you should be doing:  One, go SLOW. The last thing you need to happen is break a bone because you tripped on a root or stepped into a blind fall.  Two, head down. Seems simply enough, but generally speaking, human settlements are at the bottom of the mountain, not the top.  Three, follow running water if possible - go the direction it is going. Human settlements tend to be along water. The water also provides hydration and sources of food (I'm not talking fishing here, I'm talking grubs, maybe some crayfish, berries, etc.)  Four, LEAVE A TRAIL. Chances are, those searching for you will find your starting point. If you leave clear markers as to where you are going, they will be better equipped to find you. Torn scraps of brightly colored clothing, for example. Use a rock to mark the trees. Break branches, leave footprints, anything that clearly screams, ""Big dumb human went this way.""  Some other, general things: don't travel at night. Unless it is the desert, in which case you may have to travel at night so you don't bloody die. Most people don't understand how unbelievably BLACK it is in a forest at night. You travel at night, you will get hurt and even more lost.  Obvious survival things: don't approach the wildlife. If you find yourself in a confrontation with the wildlife, generally speaking your best option is to back away slowly while facing the animal. Turning your back and running can trigger a predatory response in things like cougars and even some bears. Most wildlife, in general, will give humans a wide berth. But don't for a minute think you are top of the food chain out there.  Bed down before it gets dark. Pick a good spot that offers some shelter from the elements and access to water, if at all possible. While fire may be a great thing, unless you are in danger of the elements, wasting precious energy trying to make one by rubbing two sticks together probably isn't the best use of your resources.  The biggest rule: don't panic. You are a one of the most environmentally adaptable mammals to ever exist. If you keep your head clear, think your way through it, you can survive."

Depending on the culture and the Royal family, those kids will be very close but they know who is who and this is important for later stage in their lives. Typically the Royal kid would join the military service and so will his friends. After graduation, the Royal man will be fast tracked through different ranks and positions, his close friends follow a rather slower pace but they remain very close from him/her and they are at an advantage. Most often, they'd come to realise how great their lives are because how kind the Royal family has been to them.

UpliftingNews,3dalgj,BuickMcKane,5,Tue Jul 14 20:44:17 2015 UTC,"""Chemical-free"" is a cheap meaningless term used in marketing to manipulate or rather trick people into buying some thing for a (probably) higher price that otherwise does not neccessarily equal ""healthier"" or better in any way shape or form.   The word ""chemical"" is drenched in negative connotation when it should be free of it; as chemicals are all around us (water, oxygen, medicine, fabric, pigment, metals, basically every thing around you et.). As some one who is a chemist, yes, I care how the term is used because it affects my livelihood, my job, the populations views, the environment, how products are made in society and where research is funded. As a consumer and a fellow inhabitant of the planet, others should too. So imagine if we had a vote about choosing whether to force limitations on chemistry research and every one due to ignorance votes ""yes"". Where will we be now? Behind. That's where we will be.  I did not mean to write so much, but I felt I had to justify my position."

Within minutes, the house was engulfed in flames as the fire department did their best to put it out.  I likely saved a family's life that night.  Indeed, I may have saved two families' lives, as it was a semidetached home.  I watched for a bit and then hit the pub.  I'm not sure whatever staff or patrons within earshot of my story believed me but at least I know what I did.  Still, a gift basket from the family could have been nice.

UpliftingNews,3d65o8,goodiereddits,2,Tue Jul 14 19:50:34 2015 UTC,"I should probably have said ""slowing"" rather than ""slow.""  IP started slowing down dramatically last year.  Patent Litigation is down because of IPRs at the PTAB (aka the ""Patent Death Squad"") and recent caselaw, including Alice.  IPRs let defendants invalidate patents that have been asserted against them very quickly with leanly-staffed legal teams, and companies are asserting fewer patents as a result.  Lots of IP litigators unable to make hours are switching to transactional and prosecution work, so that work is split up across more attorneys.  And Alice has decreased work in those areas as well, as companies appear to be more hesitant to spend money on software-related patents.  And copyright and trademark work hasn't really been that hot in my geographic area either.  Most of this is speculation and word-of-mouth.  The only concrete datapoint I have is the number of cases filed has dropped significantly between 2014 and 2015.  Some IP boutiques and IP departments at bigger firms have had layoffs as well.  See, e.g. http://abovethelaw.com/2015/07/whats-going-on-at-kenyon-kenyon/  Corporate compliance is another story, but I probably need at least another 3 years of experience before making that jump."

UpliftingNews,3d65o8,steezmasterJones,2,Tue Jul 14 12:45:23 2015 UTC,"In my experience it isn't that bad but the big issue nobody wants to discuss after graduation is location. I went to a bottom rung school and my grades were pretty middling to boot. Passed the bar. Yea, my prospects were not great staying in the cities where there are a lot of attorneys already and my more studious classmates are on the hunt as well.   I got out of town and went to the the closest approximation of nowhere that I could find in my state. There are actually a number of jobs out in the country. I don't know the exact factors that cause it but for whatever reason there are not a lot of recent law grads looking to practice in Bumfuck. But there is work and a lot of older general practitioners who are happy to push it onto your plate so they can get back to their regular schedule of only being in the office 3 days a week from nine to noon.   You won't be making a big firm job's salary but considering the cost of living out here you can make a good living of it. For example, I rent a 3 bedroom house, built in 2011. All stainless steel appliances, crown molding, some hardwood, some carpet for $750/month. Internet only gets up to 30/5 on residential plans. The county I used to live in had municipal fiber which was an interesting revelation for being out in the sticks.   My girlfriend is also an attorney and she got a job as a public defender. They essentially give her hazard pay to be out here because so few people want to do the country gig. Just to give another example. So yea, there is work, just gotta travel to it dust bowl style.   Edit: Yes, I know this anecdotal. Yes, I know that 2 cases doesn't make up for the crops of thousands of new attorneys trying to hit the market but I do question what restrictions people may be placing on themselves for work when two idiots like us can move an hour and a half out of civilization and easily land jobs."
UpliftingNews,3d65o8,ThighMaster250,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:41:52 2015 UTC,"The legal market is not THAT bad. Most schools in the top 50 in the U.S. Have employment rates of around 60%-70% with average salaries at 6 figures. Sure going to law school isn't the guaranteed job security it once was but its still relatively easy to land a job if you are in the top 50% of your class. The problem is there's about 200 credited law schools in the U.S. So while a school like The University of Florida might see a 79% employment rate despite only being ranked 47th national, it's still the highest ranked law school in the state and as such will receive heavy recruitment from Florida firms. Other Florida schools like Barry Law ranked 180+ however are hard pressed to get 50% employment after graduation. I would say going to a T14 is only a MUST if you are planning on practicing outside of the state where you studied law or if you want to compete in a heavily saturated North East market, I.e. NY, Boston, Chicago, D.C."

UpliftingNews,3d65o8,nor567,7,Tue Jul 14 10:46:17 2015 UTC,"Law schools are money cows for mediocre schools. They generate a lot of money, in exchange for relatively low startup cost (all you need is a library, some books and some professors, as opposed to a hospital for a med school which requires an enormous amount of money upfront). The problem is compounded by the fact that there a virtually no downside to the school itself for starting a law school; they're cheap to maintain, they make the school look more prestigious and they're a low risk investment. Ideally, the number of law schools allowed to operate would be tied to the demand for lawyers (there are very few med and vet schools in the country, and it's extremely hard to start a new one). However, because every no name county state school in the country have been opening law schools, the law market is completely flooded. Every time a new law school opens, they're making the already terrible job prospects for recent grads even worse, knowing full well their students will have no leverage in the job market. This means a lot of law schools operate as money and esteem generators for the school, at the expense of their own school. If the accreditation board were doing its job, they severely restrict who can open a new law school, and probably close all but the top 40 or so law schools to restore sanity to the law jobs market. As it is right now, if you don't graduate top of your class in a top 10 law school, you're going to be searching very hard for a job that probably will never break 6 figures (while those who do graduate top from said law schools are enjoying the perks of starting salaries nearing $200,000 at massive firms). It's very much a buyers market for law students."

UpliftingNews,3d65o8,ChamferedWobble,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:47:52 2015 UTC,"First of all, the article says that you have to be working with their career services.  Second, they probably have terms requiring you to apply to a minimum number of jobs.  Third, the longer you go without a legal job, the harder it is to get one.  It takes time to get a job once you start the search, so if you wait 9 months you won't have a job until at least 12 months out unless you're incredibly lucky and even 12 months might be wishful thinking.  If you don't have one after 24 months, your chances of finding a decent job as an attorney plummet.  Lawyers in the U.S. tend to be pretentious.  If you go without legal work for two years, many firms will just throw your resume away."

UpliftingNews,3d46b2,warhead71,2,Mon Jul 13 21:09:55 2015 UTC,"Gigawatts are a measurement of power, not energy. A gigawatt-hour battery would be a measurement of capacity, and is probably what you were trying to say.  If that is the case, you are wrong. The Tesla model S can realistically get 250 miles to a charge, driving it fast. The Tesla model S has an 85KWh battery. A gigawatt-hour battery would allow an electric car to travel 3 million miles to a charge. While yes, this would significantly increase the sales of electric cars, (never have to charge it up), most people would be happy if their car could be charged in the time it takes for you to put gas in it.  If that is not the case, and you did indeed mean batteries capable of outputting a gigawatt, you are wrong. How many people do you see looking at a car and saying ""oh no i couldn't possible buy a car with less than 1.3 million horsepower"" (the horsepower equivalent of a gigawatt)"
UpliftingNews,3d46b2,KaktitsM,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:08:16 2015 UTC,The electric grid - needs Gigawatts+ for storing Solar/Wind power ect. I didnt mean a car would mean Gigawatts. Without storage - hydrogen could be the better future option.

On the one hand you are 100 percent correct, a young mother about to bring a child into a potentially disastrous situation/life should absolutely have the option to have an abortion and that is certainly one better option her mother could have taken rather than abandon the child at birth.  On the other hand she would literally not be alive today if her mother would have done that.  So many ""should have's"" in her life.."

UpliftingNews,3d0d75,His_submissive_slut,4,Sun Jul 12 20:05:56 2015 UTC,"Personally, I don't believe the fetus at the time of abortion was ""her"". I don't believe that the potential for complex life equals an actual person yet. ""She"" was only created by her life, not when a sperm and egg met.  No child should have to deal with that situation and I believe abortions can be one factor in solving the issue. What I hate about comments like you made is you create the idea that abortion is the main solution, when education and access to birth control and a better support structure for people who need help is the main answer. Abortion is just one small part of a large solution, so why do you try and make it such a huge deal? Why do you think that fighting against abortion helps more than promoting safe sex practices and birth control access?"
UpliftingNews,3d0d75,Nuttin_Up,0,Sun Jul 12 22:39:40 2015 UTC,"I'm all for birth control! Never in my life have I been against it!   My problem is with people who are irresponsible and will abort as a way of ""solving the issue"". It doesn't solve the issue. Yes, it kills someone and keeps them from being born thus absolving any responsibility for raising the child that was created but the woman (or couple) will have to forever live with the knowledge that they killed their kid in exchange for convenience.  Also, question for ya, if life doesn't begin at conception when does it begin?"
UpliftingNews,3d0d75,His_submissive_slut,2,Sun Jul 12 19:45:21 2015 UTC,"Sure, it solves it. How does it not?"
UpliftingNews,3d0d75,His_submissive_slut,0,Sun Jul 12 20:08:27 2015 UTC,I told you how it doesn't solve the issue. Abortion absolves responsibility.  And you didn't answer my question.
UpliftingNews,3d0d75,DeltaIndiaCharlieKil,2,Sun Jul 12 21:33:29 2015 UTC,"I think you and I are talking at cross purposes.   What issue do you believe is unsolved by abortion? In my view, unable/unwilling to care for baby --> no baby = a solution, but we might be talking about different problems.   As to your question, I don't know when life begins, nor especially care. If they haven't been born, and they aren't viable, I don't think it's a big deal."
UpliftingNews,3d0d75,Nuttin_Up,2,Sun Jul 12 21:45:03 2015 UTC,"I also tend to disagree that abortion absolves responsibility. In my worldview, it is a responsibility."
UpliftingNews,3d0d75,DeltaIndiaCharlieKil,2,Sun Jul 12 22:43:48 2015 UTC,"if life doesn't begin at conception when does it begin?   I don't know enough to give you an exact moment. Really, it's an unanswerable question. I personally don't believe that a fertilized egg is ""a person"". It's the potential for a person, but not a legal person. I don't think that when people do in vitro and have fertilized eggs that they do not use that those are all children with souls and identities.   I'm assuming we will never agree because of this fundamental difference of what constitutes a life, and that's understandable. I'm not expecting to change your mind, and I'm assuming you aren't either.   I still don't understand why you think fighting abortions is the answer? If you were to make abortions illegal, would the situation be solved? Would getting rid of abortions inherently create a system in which parents who are unable to care for their children would be able to responsibly raise a child simply because they have to?    Where as fighting for birth control access and sex education would help solve those problems.  It would teach people who are unable to raise a child how to avoid pregnancy until they are stable and able to take on such a responsibility. It would also help solve the issue of abortion because with proper birth control and education people will not need an abortion. If people could have easy and very affordable access to birth control, why would they opt for the expensive and more difficult abortion?  And yet the people who are not given the option (especially victims of rape and incest) would still have protection.  It just seems like turning everything into an abortion debate is so myopic in the scheme of the actual issues and solutions."
UpliftingNews,3d0d75,You_Dont_Exist_,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:47:02 2015 UTC,"If we don't know when life begins then wouldn't it be prudent to protect an embryo from its conception? Why kill when we could let live?  I am all for birth control... even free birth control, and sex ed. But within that, I believe the people need to be taught what abortion really does... it ends a life... and they should also know the psychological damage having an abortion will do to a woman.  I was once married to a woman who had an abortion. She was all kinds of fucked up because of it.  I understand that I might be myopic but at the same time I believe that abortion is wrong in most every circumstance so I will always  fight against it."
UpliftingNews,3d0d75,LinoaB,2,Sun Jul 12 23:35:41 2015 UTC,"what abortion really does... it ends a life   And there we will always disagree. It ends the potential for life. The potential for an amazing, beautiful life. And the potential for a horrible, abused, victimized life.  You cannot guarantee which one that will be, but you can up the odds when the child is born to parents who cannot handle the responsibility nor want to.  I don't believe than any life is better than no life, no matter how dismal.   I'm sorry about your ex wife, and I do not know her story. I do know people who have also had abortions and were fine afterward. Who went on to have children in a time where they were married, had jobs, had maturity and the ability to give that child the best tools they can to live a good life. The people they were and the situation their life was for the earlier pregnancy was completely different. They do not regret their choice. They may wish they could have been different people earlier, but they know they did not have the skills to be the parents they are now.    know the psychological damage having an abortion will do to a woman.   I think you have to factor in the psychological damage raising a child, especially when you are unable to. I agree that for some women an abortion can be very difficult and proper counseling and support should be given. I would contend that being a parent is much more psychologically damaging than an abortion.    wouldn't it be prudent to protect an embryo from its conception?   Why? I don't believe in life for the sake of life. I believe in creating life in situations where the children who are born are given the best opportunities they can.   Anyway, I don't think that you are going to change your mind, nor should you. I just think fighting in the manner you seem to doesn't make sense? Do you pop up in stories of children who were neglected and mention that if they were aborted they would never have experienced violence and abuse? Or do you conveniently cherry pick the cases where the child is able to thrive against the odds and swoop in and mention abortion?"

A hijab does not cover the face (its a bit like what Indians do with a sari, really), both the burqa and niqab do cover the face (niqab is a face veil that is usually paired with an abaya that is basically just a black cloak).   There has been a recent drama about a woman in court having to remove her veil in order to provide evidence, but that seems like a reasonable requirement in order for her testimony to be evaluated. Other than that, copying the 'burqa ban' from France doesn't seem like it was ever likely, and even more unlikely now that the results of the French law have become apparent.  edit: blimey I mangled my sentence structure"

I remember one girl getting up there, poor thing. This was in 2005 so it was still pretty fresh, but while the rest of us were going on about how people who smoke aren't dumb and don't lose braincells, she came out and gave one of the most impassioned presentations I have ever seen. She held back tears as she asked us to realize that not all her people were filthy terrorists and that she wished people would look beyond that and see her for her and not her for a muslim. I never saw that, she was a funny, very smart girl even if she was sort of a square.   It took ballballs to get up and do that though. It was easy for me to get up and start making stoner jokes and disputing arguments because it was all sort of a joke. Her? I can imagine she struggled with what she would say for a long time; she was very shy, kept to herself and soft spoken. Dina you have my everlasting respect for that one.

UpliftingNews,3cytso,RustyTrukk,2,Sun Jul 12 14:07:49 2015 UTC,"Most people care about religion to the extent of formalities.   Like not eating meat on Fridays, but having salmon or lobster. That's not exactly a hardship."
UpliftingNews,3cytso,ChiliFlake,13,Sun Jul 12 14:01:18 2015 UTC,"Not really. There's a distinction between pretty and sexy that's relevant here, I think. To certain people, they're both desirable, but then again to certain people modesty is a desirable trait in women as well."
UpliftingNews,3cytso,HenkieVV,3,Sun Jul 12 14:48:10 2015 UTC,"I've seen some of the arguments for modesty in Christianity (not much for Islam) and the idea of ""stumbling blocks"" comes up a lot.  Basically, they believe that women shouldn't be ""stumbling blocks"" for male Christians by making the men think sexual thoughts about them by wearing revealing clothes.  Women are expected to dress modestly because otherwise, the men they're around might think sexual thoughts, which is a sin to them.  I recently read that the Duggars actually have a code word the girls tell their brothers (and sometimes father) so they know a woman who is dressed immodestly is coming and they can avert their eyes until she passes.  In one survey of teenagers who believed in this form of modesty, some boys responding actually complained about their sisters dressing immodestly and being stumbling blocks for them.  Because who hasn't seen their sister's knees and thought ""That's hot,"" am I right?  The whole situation mindset is utterly terrifying to me."
UpliftingNews,3cytso,tsukinon,15,Sun Jul 12 10:38:12 2015 UTC,"She looks beautiful and modest. It's not sexual so I don't think it exactly applies. Some muslims may argue about it but from what I've seen, it's mostly about the sexual aspect of it like smokey eyes or dark lipstick.   I don't think she looks either."
UpliftingNews,3cytso,tabascocult,8,Sun Jul 12 15:41:31 2015 UTC,"Some people do say that, some people say looking nice while modest is fine. Depends on how you feel about it I guess"
UpliftingNews,3cytso,facedawg,4,Sun Jul 12 10:36:06 2015 UTC,"I don't know much about modesty in Islam, but a certain group of fundamental Christians who believe in modesty dress here's would say yes.  (Note at the bottom where it talks about how some shoes aren't modest.). Their view is basically that women should do everything possible to keep men from thinking ""impure thoughts"" otherwise they'll be a stumbling block.  Because if there's one thing teenage girls can do, it's keeping teenage boys from thinking about sex.  /s  This isn't a view held by all Christians or even all Christiand who believe on modesty, but it's definitely held by a pretty vocal minority.  But I think that women who choose to dress that way all have different motivations, which means different answers to your question."

UpliftingNews,3cytso,DasND,2,Sun Jul 12 15:52:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's has a lot of interpretations.  Apparently the phrase ""modest is hottest"" has been gaining traction and I recently read a blog post where a woman took issue with it because it was another way of objectifying women.  It's one of those issues that I don't follow closely but do tend to click if I come across a link, partly because I have fundamentalist relatives (a while back, some of the older women were indignant because the preacher said in a sermon that it was inappropriate for women to wear pants to church) and partly because it's interesting.  I'm lucky that my own mom was sane about it.  I followed my school dress code (except the time in kindergarten I was sent home from the private Christian school I attended because my shirt was too revealing), but my mom was pretty quick to point out that I was tall and that it wasn't always possible to find skirts and shorts that were long enough."
UpliftingNews,3cytso,tsukinon,5,Sun Jul 12 16:17:58 2015 UTC,"Yes it does, you hair and neck are not supposed to show, you're also not supposed to wear makeup. But many girls these days wear the hijab as a formality and to indicate an Islamic identity, not for the sake of modesty."

UpliftingNews,3cytso,ljuvlig,3,Sun Jul 12 16:46:15 2015 UTC,"I suppose there the idea of modesty varies a lot by culture and individual. In this context, I don't think the idea of modesty would mean humble or quiet or low-key. Here's what I go for when I dress myself: I want to be seen as a person before I am seen as a woman. I try to dress in a way that desexualizes my body, by covering up what would receive the most sexual attention. My goal is to be recognized for my mind and the person that I am before I am recognized for the body that I'm in. I don't think that necessarily means trying to dress in a way that makes one invisible. I personally wouldn't spend that much time, money and effort trying to look good, but I don't really think this girl does a bad job of covering up."

UpliftingNews,3cytso,ZDTreefur,45,Sun Jul 12 04:15:14 2015 UTC,"I like how so many here think she won due to pity. Like a giant group of students got together one day and said, ""hey! Let's vote for her, because we feel bad!""  It was a popular vote, and for all we know, she could have been one of the popular kids. Or maybe she did legitimately win the award. Personally, I don't recall that many kids dressing that well at my highschool graduating class of 1300.   Maybe we should let mfa or ffa chime in lol."

UpliftingNews,3cytso,Alundra828,23,Sun Jul 12 04:18:18 2015 UTC,"There's reason to believe people voted for her just to appear tolerant and progressive. Because it's a news story. If it's as meaningless and mundane as people want others to believe, it would most likely not even be mentioned anywhere because it's ultimately just some nowhere high school nobody would care about otherwise.  Obviously it's not mundane, otherwise it wouldn't have made the news.  Whether or not I do or don't believe or have suspicions or w/e, people's responses are understandable."
UpliftingNews,3cytso,leylose2308,3,Sun Jul 12 05:06:41 2015 UTC,I think it is as mundane as people want to believe but the people are selling the story otherwise.  The fact that it was posted in uplifting news is where the pity vote narrative comes from.

UpliftingNews,3cytso,DifferingVantage,6,Sun Jul 12 03:55:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks my friend across the Internet! I do appreciate your words, it shows that there are people out who can think for think for themselves.  And yes, you are right, people from western countries can not know the reality of living in a muslim country unless they keep themselves updated with news from there. I accept that not everyone has the time to do that, which is fine, for example I am not as deeply concerned about the problems in Africa as I am in for Pakistan. But then again, I wouldn't claim to be an expert on African matters and would not jump to conclusions, but instead educate myself before passing judgement.  It is just bad for humanity that for reasons that have everything to do with political correctness and nothing to do with common sense so many otherwise intelligent liberals try to be ""friends to the poor Muslims"".  I guess I am an Islamophobe: I do fear Islam. This is a fear of the ideology and the kind of present it has given EVERY muslim country, and the future it promises. Having lived it, having seen everything it is capable of, and seeing the unchecked population explosion in muslim countries, I am very afraid of what kind of future this religion is promising mankind. Hint: It is a future that Islamic State are trying very hard to achieve.  Note that I am afraid of the ideology, not those who profess belief in it. In that sense I am afraid of the literal followers of the religion. But I can't respect people who still believe in iron-age nonsense."

It was around 1998, I think they were about 11, when they met at the camp at the end of a fencing match, when they took off their masks and found out that they looked identical.  Long story short they got their single mother and single father, who had previously divorced each other, back together and they had a good ending."

UpliftingNews,3cvwib,boredgenius,3,Sat Jul 11 11:05:25 2015 UTC,It can't be. I had seen this news a few months back.
UpliftingNews,3cvwib,sensualaustralians,62,Sat Jul 11 15:46:42 2015 UTC,"There was a documentary about Chinese twins, one American, one Norwegian that also found out about each other.   The Chinese authorities had intentionally split them up and provided false records saying they were only children.  This is a good one to watch if you can find it online.  http://www.cbc.ca/passionateeye/episodes/twin-sisters"
UpliftingNews,3cvwib,Guenther110,27,Sat Jul 11 12:57:00 2015 UTC,"I remember that. It really sucked because there was a language barrier and they could barely talk to each other, speaking different languages and all. It would have been nice if they could both speak English and Norwegian fluently, they're sisters ffs. It really sucks that they were separated like that.  I kinda thought they should have both been adopted by the Norwegian couple, but I'm terrible like that."
UpliftingNews,3cvwib,sensualaustralians,21,Sat Jul 11 15:02:46 2015 UTC,How can there be a language barrier between a Norwegian and an American? All of the Norwegians I met spoke almost perfect English
UpliftingNews,3cvwib,lindymad,19,Sat Jul 11 15:48:36 2015 UTC,"Adults, maybe, but not a little girl. I mean sure, she was learning in school but her English was extremely limited, making it difficult to communicate with her sister. It bothers me that her sister's American parents just assumed that the twin would have to learn English to accommodate her sister, and the little girl seemed to have gotten the attitude that her sister should have to learn English as well. Not a word about her possibly learning Norwegian, not at all. It was sad to me.  Furthermore, we need to get away from the idea that Norwegians (or anyone whose native language isn't English) are obligated to learn, speak, and understand English. That's just not fair, and is quite frankly very weird.  In an ideal world, both girls would speak English, Norwegian, and Chinese (Mandarin) together."
UpliftingNews,3cvwib,redditguy2009,24,Sat Jul 11 15:57:36 2015 UTC,"Furthermore, we need to get away from the idea that Norwegians (or anyone whose native language isn't English) are obligated to learn, speak, and understand English. That's just not fair, and is quite frankly very weird.   While I agree that it's unfair and weird that all non-native speaking people should have to learn your* language while you don't have learn theirs,   it is a good idea to have one language that everyone learns, so that we don't all have to learn lots of languages and deal with translation and understanding issues all the time.  English has fallen into place as that language mostly because of how history has unfolded to this point and this clearly gives preference to native English speakers. Do you think it would be better to use a different language,  construct a new one, such as Esperanto or just stick with the idea of everyone learning a new language each time they want to communicate with another group of people that have their own language?  * I mean your in the general sense, not you personally or even English specifically"

UpliftingNews,3cvwib,Guenther110,7,Sat Jul 11 16:06:51 2015 UTC,"Seriously. I am very upset that I cannot speak Spanish fluently. I didn't get the opportunity to learn until I was 12 (way too late). Although my level of Spanish far exceeds the people I took classes with, this was due purely to my lucky brain, and I still can't speak it properly or understand it as well as I need to. But I acknowledge that I am so, so lucky to even have what I do and I need to work on it more. I just worry that my brain is too old now, but I'm going to try anyway."
UpliftingNews,3cvwib,boredgenius,4,Sat Jul 11 16:08:30 2015 UTC,"but not a little girl   Ah, I see. I just assumed they were grown-ups. I agree that it would be nice for the American twin to learn Norwegian. (Might be kind of difficult though to find a teacher for that in a random place in the US?)   Furthermore, we need to get away from the idea that Norwegians [...] are obligated to learn, speak, and understand English.   I sort of agree, it is certainly unfair and unlikeable to just assume/expect that everyone speaks your native language. Then again, as a non-native speaker of English myself, I also kind of think that everyone should in fact learn English, if only for their own good. You could probably say that everyone should know at least one foreign language..."

Apparently, whenever he was paired to work with them in the boiler rooms, it meant he had to work harder to make up for them. And for what it's worth, I've never heard him say a bad word about any races otherwise, he's not just ""that kinda guy"".   I guess it goes to show that each person should be taken on their own merits, and not lumped in with general stereotypes, good or bad.

UpliftingNews,3csv79,SugoiBeans,2,Fri Jul 10 23:34:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, but at the same time, you can't exist in this naive state where you say that every single human being is equally individual and should never be included in any sort of broader category based on any number of characteristics.   This is not something that can exist in some kind of absolute. It has to be a balance.  Stereotypes exist because they do. And there is nothing wrong with being aware of them, and acting in a manner that in the absence of any other information at least we have some rough game plan. But once you start dealing with the other person, you should have an open mind, and let their words and action speak for themselves.   Racism is our innate reaction when me meet someone who is different than us that we don't feel is like one of ""us"". That's just our biology based on our cave man DNA. But we have brains, which separate us from our emotions.   The point is not to pretend that we're not going to make a bunch of mental connections based on our past experiences when encountering an unknown, the point is that we are not going to let those control us, that we will have an open mind towards the people we meet, and let their actions define them. And yes, probably to some degree a lot of them will reinforce those stereotypes we knew before, but quite a few won't. And it is for the sake of those who don't, that we need to give them the opportunity to either prove or hang themselves.  This applies to race, gender, religion, or any other criteria. Just keep an open mind and let people define themselves. They all will, for better or worse."

Always tried to avoid work, smoked in the restrooms etc. I hated it, because i rather work, than standing around doing nothing. But there was one group of russian speaking guys, who just never stopped working for a second. They didn't talk much with other guys, but i always saw them shanking their heads if Germans or other countries just stood there talking shit. If the Russians didn't have anything to do, they started their own projects, like building stuff for their home, or helping other russian guys with their work. Great guys. Once they saw, that i kept my mouth shut and didn't avoid work, they helped me with my work too. Those guys really just need some scrap metal and can fix pretty much anything."

Pigs, on the other hand, are bad for our our ecosystem and their meat is not necessary for human health. It shouldn't matter what purpose the animals serve to us. When we consider if it's right or wrong to harm them shouldn't it be a calculation of the harm caused to the animals versus the benefit to humans?"
UpliftingNews,3coocj,macaroni_monster,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:52:53 2015 UTC,"Pigs can be sustainably produced and bear encounters can be avoided. The black bear population is nowhere near what it was a few hundred years ago and we only still have black bears because there are regulations against killing them, same goes for all large animals in the US. All have been on the brink of extinction and have laws against killing them for a reason. We just decide that a greatly reduced population is the one that best suits us with our current population. Their acceptable population size is inverse to our own."

In some ways we are taken advantage of in Canada due to less people and less competition.  But, overall, the cost of actually living isn't much different, food prices somethings here are cheap that aren't there (I lived in California), housing in most places is around the same. Goods have mostly normalised aside from our low dollar at the moment. When you live in a place you get used to how to work the system so to speak.

It's sad but inevitable that the more we reproduce, the more we take up the land inhabited by wild animals. It's a practical choice, choosing people over animals, but once the choice is made a lot of harsh truths must be put into action. Bears can be very dangerous to humans when they get used to them just like any apex predator (aligators come to mind since I live in FL). You live on Vancouver Island so this is obvious to you but the ""hippies"" may be some suburban teenager who has never even seen a bear outside of a zoo and wonders why you would kill a helpless little cub. It's sad, you've just become desensitized to it because it's an every day real problem in your area and you're pragmatic. I don't know about you but if it was me put in that situation, while I would likely end up doing the deed because it's my job and I think it's probably what needs to be done, it would be hard for me to kill those cubs.

UpliftingNews,3clplo,Rrraou,88,Thu Jul 9 07:15:38 2015 UTC,Or someone with an air conditioner on.  We have a car that is super quiet and has a remote start.  We often remote start the car and run in to the bathroom.  The air conditioner runs the whole time.  The dog sometimes pants anyway because it is a dog.  I guess just because they aren't criminally liable doesn't mean they aren't civilly liable.
UpliftingNews,3clplo,EllenPaosDirtyMoney,10,Thu Jul 9 02:27:36 2015 UTC,"More and more cars these days are electric, which ""idle"" silently. It's damn near impossible to tell if it is running or not."

While my hybrid doesn't run the gas engine most of the time during idle, the climate control fan is plenty loud on a hot day.  Hopefully this is enough of a hint that the pet isn't in danger.  But, yeah, my wife worries about this every time we step away with the car running, doors locked."
UpliftingNews,3clplo,flunky_the_majestic,24,Thu Jul 9 06:18:36 2015 UTC,"If they break into your car with good intentions, but your dog wasn't actually in trouble, they'll still be criminally liable, I imagine. And at the very least, they'll have to pay for your window in small claims court."
UpliftingNews,3clplo,WeHaveFreshCookies,47,Thu Jul 9 20:59:51 2015 UTC,"I love you. Thank you.  Had an incident where the cops once kicked my door down because someone twice my age happened to share the same name as me, and was wanted for skipping out on parole.  They made me come outside, lay on the ground in my boxers with no shirt on, and had multiple guns trained on me while they ran my ID. They asked me at least 4 times if I was on parole and told me they didn't believe me, until dispatch got back to them that they had the wrong guy. Then they claimed they kicked my door down because they ""heard a woman screaming."" I told them how it was impossible and they were like well maybe a neighbors apartment and it just sounded like yours.  They happily explained that the city would pay for my door to be repaired, all I had to do was go to the station and fill out some paperwork and file some forms and I would be reimbursed within 5-6 months. The hours of time it would've taken made it the furthest thing from ""worth it"" as possible.. Long story short, I had to sleep in a house with an un-lockable door overnight until the next day when the hardware store was open.  I'm sure you might get restitution on someone breaking your car window.... within 1-4 years..."
UpliftingNews,3clplo,skrilled,10,Thu Jul 9 04:13:56 2015 UTC,They kick your door down for skipping parole? That's crazy! That doesn't happen here is Australia as far as I know. Do they even knock?
UpliftingNews,3clplo,GintaSempai,8,Thu Jul 9 04:48:10 2015 UTC,"They really aren't supposed to. Whether it means anything will depend on where you are, but even with a warrant most states have some degree of a ""knock and announce"" rule. The ""heard a woman screaming"" is bullshit if they didn't investigate the neighbor's place as well, wouldn't hold up in court (if it ever got there)."
UpliftingNews,3clplo,AmnesiaCane,7,Thu Jul 9 05:41:47 2015 UTC,They kick your door down because they like kicking down doors - the parole is just an excuse.

UpliftingNews,3clplo,evenmorebetter,5,Thu Jul 9 09:00:57 2015 UTC,Thats another point. I have severe phobia of being broken into so bad that in the past 6 months I have not gotten much sleep at night at least. I am getting a companion dog for emotional distress but also going to train it as a certified guard dog... that means if someone breaks into my car it will probably attack in the defense of proporty and life. I would not be liable because they do not need to be breaking into my car.

Not everyone will be looking inside cars unless they're trying to steal something then they'll just use the pet as an excuse to steal anything thats not nailed down.

Would this a better option that figuring out a way to ""teach"" or assist them on how to properly do such tasks on their own?  I honestly don't know a lot about the subject and am interested. Thanks."
UpliftingNews,3cjksj,KikiTheArtTeacher,76,Wed Jul 8 18:59:10 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why it is the case, but I teach at a school for children with ASD and a lot of my kids have very poor fine motor skill/weak muscle tone in their hands and arms.. Imagine not being able to hold a pencil properly because it hurts your hand so much? Now imagine trying to do up a zipper, or figure out small button holes feeling like that. Another common problem amongst the boys I teach is putting clothes on back to front. I take my class swimming each week, and although they can all independently change, one of my boys has absolutely no patience and is often 'in his own world.' So, he will put his trousers on backward and inside out (because he's daydreaming about something else), realise they are on backwards, have a complete meltdown, and then refuse to turn them around the right way because he 'likes them that way.' This is not counting the times I have had students emerge totally naked from changing rooms because they can't find their underwear, etc.and they don't have enough understanding of social conventions to realise that they should have just asked for help before coming out. I didn't really know much about this before I started teaching either--I think when a lot of people think about autism (or at least in my case) they don't tend to think about some of the practical issues, especially relating to sensory stuff (another example--one of my students will only eat beige food and at the moment that means the only thing he likes is plain Pringles)"
UpliftingNews,3cjksj,FluffySharkBird,9,Wed Jul 8 19:52:49 2015 UTC,I wonder how this affects girls.  Breasts and all.  I can't imagine having a comfortable shirt I that is never backwards that wouldn't have weird fabric sag on my back or be too tight on my boobs.
UpliftingNews,3cjksj,chocolatetomatoes,9,Wed Jul 8 23:30:15 2015 UTC,"I'm an aspie and a trans guy with big boobs.  Crew necks were always very uncomfortable and too hot/had too much space between the biggest part of the breast and the neck, so I stopped wearing them.  Bras are also difficult.  I was never able to put on a bra like most people do, by sticking the arms through the holes and hooking the clasp from the back; it just never worked for me, so I clasp the bra first and put it on like I'm putting on a shirt.  This was a cause of insecurity when in locker rooms.  Boobs are overall pretty uncomfortable, especially the boob sweat and tightness sometimes, but it might be worse for me because I'm trans."
UpliftingNews,3cjksj,Luissen,9,Thu Jul 9 00:13:51 2015 UTC,"the few people with big breasts who actually will talk to me about such things clasps them upside down, with the back in front of them, then spin it around so the cups are in front of them, before rolling the whole assembly up and over."
UpliftingNews,3cjksj,Kiwi_bananas,2,Thu Jul 9 00:27:48 2015 UTC,"This is bad for the bra, if possible they should clasp it behind them, it's difficult for everyone at first but possible with practice."
UpliftingNews,3cjksj,CafeAuGay,5,Thu Jul 9 04:39:48 2015 UTC,I think the band might be the wrong size if you can slip it over your shoulders when it's clasped. I've never thought to put a bra on then hook it behind my back without looking though; I've always hooked the band on first in front of my body with the bra upside down and inside facing out. Then I just scoot the whole thing around so the clasp is in the back and I pull the straps on.
UpliftingNews,3cjksj,chocolatetomatoes,2,Thu Jul 9 01:01:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my bras are definitely the wrong size, but I don't have a cloth tape measure and don't shop often.  Your way of putting on a bra seems more reasonable, actually."
UpliftingNews,3cjksj,CafeAuGay,2,Thu Jul 9 02:21:47 2015 UTC,"Have you tried sports bras? I find them easier to fit, and they flatten my chest out when I want to wear men's shirts. My ex has bigger boobs, so she wears two at a time to keep things from jiggling when we run."
UpliftingNews,3cjksj,Kiwi_bananas,2,Thu Jul 9 04:48:12 2015 UTC,"This is bad for the bra, causes it to stretch and not fit right. Try clasping it behind your back, feels awkward at first but you get used to it."
UpliftingNews,3cjksj,CafeAuGay,3,Thu Jul 9 04:41:13 2015 UTC,"I've heard that, but I really can't see how sliding the bra around to the front stretches the band anymore than closing it behind your back, and it's certainly better for the band than closing it and putting the whole thing over your head.  Actually, on second thought, the band is around your waist, the smallest part of your torso, when it's hooked on and scooted around. Adjusting it up from loose around your waist to your ribcage seems like it would stretch the band equal if not less than putting it directly on at your ribcage (where you definitely have to stretch it past it's final circumference to put it on)."
UpliftingNews,3cjksj,FluffySharkBird,3,Thu Jul 9 05:10:25 2015 UTC,I have lots of trouble putting on bras because I'm uncoordinated.  I'm not even trans or anything.  I don't like shirts with high necklines because of this stuff as well.  And shirts with buttons can be a problem.  So I'm not sure how a backwards shirt would work
UpliftingNews,3cjksj,karen_h,2,Thu Jul 9 00:41:54 2015 UTC,"Yup - bra gets the clasp put on first in front(upside down), then you swing it around at the waist, and pull it rightside up. Arms go in then.  Not meaning to sound condescending in the least - but are you friends with any women that could walk you through the basics? I don't know where you live, but if I had a friend that was transitioning, I'd be glad to schlep you to a local lingerie store and get you fitted for a proper bra.

UpliftingNews,3cjksj,Kiwi_bananas,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:50:22 2015 UTC,You should always put your arms through first then clasp behind you. Clasping at front then swinging round is really bad for the bra. And would take longer too.

UpliftingNews,3cjksj,Shupendo,8,Thu Jul 9 07:10:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for taking the time to write this.  I can completely understand the lack of motor control and being unable to complete button/zipper tasks. How does this work with things like long sleeves? Do they also have issues with those as well?   Another common problem amongst the boys I teach is putting clothes on back to front.   Is this a bigger issue for males than females or just your sample size proves to have more issues with the males?  Does the inside out also apply with things like underwear? What about things like bra's for women?  I can believe that there are millions of different levels, but where does the ""understanding of social conventions"" come into play? Is there something in development that causes them to not learn them? Would there be a better way to improve their quality of life without the need for a completely new set of clothing being created?  I'm just interested in what other alternatives could be done instead of having parents buy new clothing."
UpliftingNews,3cjksj,KikiTheArtTeacher,33,Wed Jul 8 20:06:15 2015 UTC,"Good question about the motor control! It seems to be a common problem amongst a lot of my students. I teach secondary school and many of my students struggle with things like buttons, zips, fasteners and shoelaces. All of the kids in my class have weekly input from occupational therapy and a lot of the time it is things like hand strengthening exercises, threading practice, etc. to try and teach these skills/encourage independence. I've always been interested to know why children with ASD seem to have these struggles so commonly. Is it something inherent to their diagnosis? Or, because many of them aren't interested in being able to do these tasks/have always had parents or carers do these things for them, they've not built up the same muscle groups other children their age have.  Long sleeves, trousers, even socks and shoes are definitely an issue for some. For some students, this seems to be a sensory issue--they hate the feel of the material, or feel weighted down. Some students complain of always being too warm--one of my boys will go out in a t-shirt and sandals even in the winter (luckily winter in England is never too cold but it's still a big worry). I also have students who refuse to alter their clothing in any way--so they will wear the same jumper all day every day even if it's boiling out.  Most of my students are boys, and as a general 'rule' more boys tend to be diagnosed as being on the spectrum (although people disagree about why this is) so I can't say if it is the same for females. I know that with my boys, the underwear on backwards thing definitely happens.   I can't speak for everyone, but with my current group of students I find a lot of them know appropriate social conventions--for instance, that they shouldn't walk around naked in public--but they don't really care. It doesn't bother them, and because they have issues with theory of mind, they don't see why anyone else should be bothered either. Which, to be honest, I think is sort of okay (not so much with the naked thing, but sometimes I think it must be really liberating to genuinely not give a toss what others think of you, and to just 'do as you feel' so to speak).  With the clothing thing--I think it's nice because it will give a lot of young people (and adults) more independence when getting dressed, as well as more 'options' when it comes to fashion.  Imagine being a 13 year old boy and having to ask your female teacher to help you with the button on your trousers because you can't manage it after you've been to the toilet. The other option is to always wear elasticised clothing, which is often seen as 'uncool' (and, as I've seen in schools, people on the spectrum are already bullied enough). It's awful that we are judged by appearances in this way, but even students who don't really mind what others think of them deserve to have some choices in what they wear, I think (and the fact that the clothing is made out of soft, sensory-friendly materials is a huge bonus!)  I am less concerned about the inside out issue if the child is actively deciding to wear it that way and refuses to change it--my thoughts on that are 'if he/she wants to wear it that way, that's cool.' But I definitely think that nice looking clothes without complicated fasteners is a great idea, even for adults.  Haha, sorry for the wall of text. I am by no means an expert, and I think it's very true that no two people on the spectrum are alike, but these are just some of my experiences. Hopefully does a little bit to answer some of your questions :)"

UpliftingNews,3cjksj,Shupendo,3,Fri Jul 10 17:38:40 2015 UTC,"It's really good value what you put into this, thanks =).  I know that everyone is different, but do you think a guided ""think/do for yourself"" system would be better in helping them adapt? Allowing them to build some of the motor skills required, and only guiding them when they get too flustered. Do you feel like they KNOW what to do, but can't build the habits that most of us are used to?  Do you feel like this new clothing service is a good direction to move for others as well (Elderly, ETC)?   For the buttons, zippers and such. Would something like a magnetic lock be better for them? Maybe a line up kind of catch system that locks/unlocks easier? Should we faze out standard fasteners and move to a similar solution for everyone? Do you think the cost of these fits what they are ""worth""?   I know how hard it is to deal with social pressure and having to ask someone for help is hard, especially with ""Normal"" tasks. Should we look at supporting families getting into private schools designed for these type of ""difficult"" students (Autism, ETC)? Creating a better environment for them overall, by removing some of the discomfort of some of the public schooling issues. Giving them other children around their age who struggle with the same issues."
UpliftingNews,3cjksj,KikiTheArtTeacher,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:20:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, I do! To an extent, the 'think/do for yourself' system you mention does already exist. I use visuals a lot in my class, including things like social stories, 'first/next' cards, etc. If you want to see how these are used, or some examples, the National Autistic Society has a great 'visual supports' guide, found here: http://www.autism.org.uk/visualsupports   Some students do know what they are meant to do, but may get the sequencing wrong (for instance, they know they need to put on their underpants, and their trousers, but might get confused about which of these comes first). Visuals are a big help for this. In other cases, they might simply  be distracted or unable to figure out why their clothes 'don't look quite right' (for instance, when they are on backwards or inside out).   I think the new clothing could be great for other groups of people! I wouldn't say we should get rid of standard fasteners (after all, a lot of people on the spectrum are completely independence in self-help skills too) but I think the key thing here is that it would be options for people who previously had very few.   As for the question about private schooling--I swing both ways on this. I teach at a private school for children with ASD. It was founded primarily because of the issues you mention--to create a better environment overall and help groups of children with similar issues.  In some ways, I think it is wonderful. Our staff are very experienced and we have constant training to make sure our skills are up to date. Students are in small classes with students of a similar academic ability and they often have 1:1 attention. For instance, I have 6 boys in my class and besides myself I also have 3 support staff. Students have access to a sensory room, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists and educational psychologists on a daily basis.   There are downsides though as well. Sometimes I worry that my students are living in a bit of a 'bubble.' They are often intolerant of one another. Whereas in a mainstream some students (emphasis on some) might try and overlook the characteristics that might make a student with ASD 'stand out,' in my setting the students often can't stand seeing the same/similar characteristics in another person that they display themselves. It can make it very hard to teach my students how to build lasting friendships, etc. Some days I think that in a good public school with a knowledgeable staff and the correct resources, it might be good for all the students to learn how to work and play with others who may be 'different.'    Then again, I have also seen many public schools fail children with special needs. Because I teach secondary school (year 7 and 8) most of my students have previously come from a mainstream primary. Many of my boys came to my class last September having never been in a class with other students. Some of them couldn't read, despite being very capable. They had spent 7-8 years of primary school in a room (or a corridor) with a 1:1, essentially being allowed to do whatever they wanted as long as it 'kept them quiet.' Heartbreaking.   I think I stand somewhere in the middle. I really appreciate what my school has done. Although it is technically 'private,' tuition fees are often paid for by the local borough council (meaning that there is no financial burden to parents). Although all students have ASD, we have a huge range of students across the spectrum and we try and facilitate as many opportunities as possible for all the kids to mix (for instance, yesterday I took a huge group of kids to a farm--from students who will go to a mainstream college in the autumn to students who are non-verbal. We all had a great time!). We also do weekly 'life skills' sessions which usually consist of visits into the community so that students can practice social and independence skills in 'the real world.' I feel like they are gaining much  more than they would sat in a classroom all day, being forced to sit in a desk (something that some of them cannot do for  more than a few minutes at a time) learning about a topic they probably don't care about at all (and that may not help them, to be honest. What good is knowing about social conditions in Victorian Britain, for instance, if you can't even get yourself dressed in the morning?)   I hope I answered some of your questions! I feel like I've not really given any  definite answers, just some of my jumbled thoughts on the subject. Also, thank you for asking, and being interested :)"
UpliftingNews,3cjksj,BWandstuffs,93,Fri Jul 10 18:00:01 2015 UTC,"A lot of it has to do with sensory issues.  Ever had a time where you really did not like the way something felt/heard/etc? (common examples being nails on a chalkboard and having seaweed brush up  against you in a lake)  People on the autisic spectrum tend to have significantly more issues with these things and can have these horrible reactions to common things, like zippers or tags.  While the ""no-way-to-wear-it-wrong"" will certaintly help a lot due to people on the spectrum having issues figuring out what's socially acceptable or not, another big thing is how there's no buttons, tippers, tags, etc on the clothes for sensory overload.  Autism also isn't exactly a single thing, like what you'd expect from most diseases/disorders, it's a spectrum that has many different classifications from the severely impaired that most people think of, to high-functioning Autism, usually reffered to as Asperger's.  Source: I was diagnosed with Asperger's and have had to take several years worth of classes on how to deal with it."
UpliftingNews,3cjksj,Shupendo,12,Wed Jul 8 19:21:46 2015 UTC,"It's interesting, but this would only solve some of the issues in that case then.  I can understand Buttons, Zippers, etc. being hard for them to use.  For the tags is this a common issue?"
UpliftingNews,3cjksj,BWandstuffs,46,Wed Jul 8 19:33:23 2015 UTC,"Those tags can get scratchy at times, and can probably cause sensory issues with some people.  I already cut the tags off of any shirts I own because I hate them scratching/bothering the back of my neck."
UpliftingNews,3cjksj,Eternity49,25,Wed Jul 8 19:36:48 2015 UTC,"I'm on the spectrum, tags were a HUGE issue for me growing up.  I still cut them out of my clothes sometimes."
UpliftingNews,3cjksj,Shupendo,20,Wed Jul 8 21:56:27 2015 UTC,"I'm what would be ""normal"" and I still have issues with them, so not too surprised. =)  I've noticed there are tags are less common in clothes now, but have instead changed to an ink based tag on the back of the shirt. Do you find those to be bothersome as well?"
UpliftingNews,3cjksj,Eternity49,18,Wed Jul 8 22:23:10 2015 UTC,"Nope, I was actually excited when I first started seeing shirts advertised as ""tagless""  They are great.   I hate clothes that have tags hidden in odd spots, like around the waist or something. If I don't notice it before I leave the house it sucks. Can't be stripping in public to cut a tag out of a weird spot ha."
UpliftingNews,3cjksj,Rrroxy,2,Wed Jul 8 22:34:07 2015 UTC,"Just so you know for the future, rather than ""normal"", the term for people who are not autistic is allistic. You can also just say neurotypical, which applies for more than just autism"

UpliftingNews,3cjksj,mdielmann,6,Wed Jul 8 22:03:43 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Tags, coarse fabric, wool(!), odd seams and even asymmetrical features can be very irritating. Having a logo/badge/icon on one side that changes the way the fabric pulls from one side to the other can be distracting, too.  Also, if the seams are done right, the clothes can look okay if they're inside-out, too."
UpliftingNews,3cjksj,emdeedem,5,Thu Jul 9 02:56:11 2015 UTC,"I have some severe sensory issues, and while lots of the time I can force myself to work around it I have days where a tag will literally give me a melt down. I am so excited about this clothing line."
UpliftingNews,3cjksj,Shupendo,2,Wed Jul 8 23:07:16 2015 UTC,I'm glad to hear it =)  How does the sticker shock (50$ per piece) play into it for you?
UpliftingNews,3cjksj,emdeedem,6,Wed Jul 8 23:18:52 2015 UTC,"Good quality costs more. And honestly having some anti-meltdown clothes would be well worth it. I'm not saying I'm gonna replace my entire wardrobe with the stuff, but one or two pieces for the bad days is plenty."
UpliftingNews,3cjksj,sincerely-sacha,2,Thu Jul 9 00:37:43 2015 UTC,"I have family who are on the spectrum, and are high functioning. They cut all the tags out of their clothes, and some fabrics they just refuse to wear. Any slub-knit cotton or linen items are often just way too 'rough' and they will refuse to wear the clothes."
UpliftingNews,3cjksj,EddieBurrito,18,Thu Jul 9 15:42:50 2015 UTC,"I have a friend on the spectrum who would be called ""high-functioning"" or something like that. It seems that he just CAN'T hold more than one thing in his head at a time, especially if he's emotional, tired, etc. He has a very repetitive job, so his fondness for routine works out well. He dresses pretty well but if something throws him, all bets are off on behavior. Loud noises, emotional upsets, even weird weather can cause a setback in things that he can do other times. He can dress himself, cook a few simple things and drive to work or to see a friend (we live in a small area) but it took, no joke, 20 full years of training for him to be able to accomplish those things. Plus, he works hella hard. If he knows there's a reason to learn something, he tries. Getting that logic into a 4 year old would be dicey."
UpliftingNews,3cjksj,Shupendo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:46:13 2015 UTC,"I would hope that maybe there could be a way to teach them how to control their melting down at the least. I know how hard some have it, but I feel like if there was a constructive way to ""vent"" at a young age, teaching them would be amazing. Of course I only know of what I've seen so far, but I would assume it's similar to extreme depression in a sense, where your body ""shuts down"". How does he deal with those moments?  How does driving work for him? As in other comments there is a loss of motor control in many, does he have/need any additional aides to help? Would/Does he shut down in areas with heavy traffic or car horns?  I feel like clothing to help some is a good step, but it seems like a potentially expensive step to buy clothing explicitly for these cases. (50$ per piece of clothing) As I know for some families these expenses are going to be even harder.  I'm always impressed in the way humans adapt to their issues and become better people for it. I'm just surprised there isn't a better set of resources out there already.  Thanks =)"
UpliftingNews,3cjksj,EddieBurrito,6,Wed Jul 8 22:05:04 2015 UTC,"He drives a normal car. He is not a person that has loss of motor control (no pun intended) but yes, if there were to be a very loud horn I suspect that could cause him to freeze up. I'm not sure. He's 46, so he does not have support/therapists/help now but did until he was 30."
UpliftingNews,3cjksj,abatnamedtwitch,5,Wed Jul 8 22:34:43 2015 UTC,"A lot of people on the more intense side of the spectrum lack the social awareness that walking out of a public restroom, half naked, isn't a good thing. Or that the zipper goes in the front. Things that seem so obvious to neural typical people are not on their priority list. That cat hair on your sweater though, that's gotta go. They are all so different in their abilities and disabilities. I love working with folks with asd, they are unabashedly honest about who they are and how they are feeling. It's refreshing."
UpliftingNews,3cjksj,klaghatagh,7,Wed Jul 8 22:26:28 2015 UTC,"One of the things that autism does is fucks with your executive capabilities, meaning the ability to take something big and break it down into smaller steps. You and I do this everyday without thinking about it. I say to you, ""Get dressed."" and you start putting on clothes without thinking about the steps of, finding clean and fitting underwear, making sure they're facing the right way, sliding them on one leg at a time, then finding a clean pair of pants, putting them on, zipping up the zipper and fastening the buttons, finding a matching shirt, putting that on properly, etc etc.   Some autistic people don't have the ability to take a broad command and break it down into how ever many little steps that you and I can do without thinking about it."
UpliftingNews,3cjksj,hemenwaykid,3,Thu Jul 9 00:50:10 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this, I was working with an autistic boy today (I work in a library and he was a customer, I don't have any special skills with autistic folk or anything) and I could see that everything I was saying wasn't getting across. I broke everything down and simplified it, and he was patient with me so we got it figured out, but you just defined what I could see was happening but couldn't quite put into words myself. I could tell he was smart (not smart for autism, smart for anybody), so that wasn't the problem, but information was clearly getting lost on its way from my mouth to his brain. Now that I know this (and him) hopefully I can help him better next time he comes in."
UpliftingNews,3cjksj,AppleJuiceMan,19,Thu Jul 9 03:43:32 2015 UTC,The fact they they are designed with minimal sensory interference is brilliant. People who don't have a spectrum disorder but do have a sensory processing one would still greatly benefit from these clothes.  Source: Have an SPD

UpliftingNews,3cjksj,abatnamedtwitch,12,Wed Jul 8 22:03:22 2015 UTC,"This is really great. I work with young adults with autism and they can certainly use the extra help. People with other disabilities can definitely use these kinds of clothes too. I see so many stuck in the track/athletic pants with the vertical stripe and the horizontally striped polo or t shirt. Unfortunately when your income, skills, and mobility is limited, so are your clothing options. We want them to be out in the community and the stigmas to be retired, but we also want them to live as independently as possible and dressing oneself can make or break both goals."
UpliftingNews,3cjksj,TropicanaPeaches,9,Wed Jul 8 22:20:11 2015 UTC,I love this. A very good friend of mine is a struggling adult with autism. I first met him online while playing a video game and we talk and play games all the time now. He's opened up to me about his struggles and what he can and can't do. I didn't realize at first how things I think are simple are actually hard for him. This is truly a great idea.
UpliftingNews,3cjksj,Eternity49,9,Wed Jul 8 22:29:31 2015 UTC,"This is an awesome idea, though as someone on the spectrum I don't think I could wear clothes with collars so high on the neck, that's one of the biggest issues I run into picking out clothes, besides tags. Feel like I'm being choked. and i end up tugging at it all day.   The extra soft fabric sounds epic."

I couldn't take a shirt off myself until I was 12, and don't even get me started on shoelaces...  Even something as simple as being able to dress yourself without needing help can be very liberating. I was ecstatic when I finally figured out how to take off a shirt, as ridiculous as that may sound."

UpliftingNews,3cjksj,flyawaylittlebirdie,5,Wed Jul 8 19:53:28 2015 UTC,"This article really rubbed me the wrong way. I went into this article thinking it would be awesome if the clothes helped with sensory issues and kept people from getting overstimulated, so no seams, tags, zippers and so forth to keep it from irritating the skin and wishing that there was something like that when I was a kid. But then I was wondering what kind of cloth they used, if it was soft or anything like that, because as a kid that was what I had issues with the most, not so much other stuff. But I kept reading and the author of the article just kept talking about how it helped autistic people conform to everyone else's standards. It felt like it was saying ""Isn't this great! Autistic kids won't be wearing their clothes inside out anymore and embarrassing you!""   The article makes it seems like the most important aspect of this is the fact there is no way to wear them wrong. It was only after they quote the designer that I find anything that mentions sensory issues and the material that the clothes are made of. She keeps mentioning it, which makes me really happy. Knowing a mother is willing to put so much into helping her kid be comfortable is amazing, but I was really starting to think she only cared about what others thought. This clothing line is really cool and the creator seems like a really cool lady but this article sounds like something right off the Autism Speaks website."
UpliftingNews,3cjksj,hemenwaykid,4,Thu Jul 9 01:02:12 2015 UTC,"The article would definitely be better if they'd talked to some autistic customers about what they liked (or didnt) about the clothes.   I guess I look at it it this way: my sister is disabled (though not autistic), but she loves clothes. Freaking loves them. She's more of a clothes horse than me by far. Why should she be expected to wear (or trapped in) clothes like sweat pants and t-shirts just because that's all she can put on herself, or all that my mom has time to put on her? Sometimes I like to put on a skirt and look snazzy; my sister deserves the same opportunity. If she was truly happy in sweats and t-shirts, nobody, in my family at least, would have any problem with that. But she wants to look fancy, so we do what we can to make that possible for her. It doesn't have anything to do with making her ""normal"" or ""socially acceptable,"" it has to do with making her happy. Obviously I don't know if this is where designer mom's head is, but that's me and my family."
UpliftingNews,3cjksj,flyawaylittlebirdie,2,Thu Jul 9 03:59:46 2015 UTC,"I think you misunderstand where I'm coming from a little. The mom in this article is the bomb. What I have an issue with is the author of the article and how they come across when writing this. The mom's reason for her choices are almost all for comfort, very little for seeming normal, but also making them pleasing instead of drab, like all the other sensory clothes there are. The author of the article makes it sound like it's about the parents of the kids when it's really not."

UpliftingNews,3cjksj,Dakroon1,3,Thu Jul 9 05:11:45 2015 UTC,"Sorry, economies of scale mean specialist items will always cost a lot more.  We have a false idea of how much it costs to produce (and transport) something because so many of the things we buy are mass-produced by gigantic companies at scale.  Most people have no idea how much more expensive things are at even slightly less volume.  Remember when the iPhone was first announced, and everybody made fun of it for being so expensive?  That was when they sold only (ha) about a million per quarter.  Now they're selling over 50 million a quarter, and the price is more in line with other phones.  That's scale for ya.  When you're rich, building things gets a lot cheaper.  So does shipping, and advertising.  Technology only exacerbates this effect.  Hypothetically, even if you were 1/1000th as rich as Levi's, you couldn't buy 1/1000th of a Superbowl ad, and even if you could, you wouldn't get 1/1000th the publicity of their full Superbowl ad.  Scale helps the big guys.  So if you're expecting someone making a few thousands pairs of pants to be able to compete with Levi's on price, you're going to be sorely disappointed.  :-("

I think what would be a very interesting and possibly effective solution would be a hemp based plastic,  potentially able to retain the strength needed to be put together and taken apart many times while being nearly a net negative on the carbon footprint due to hemp's ability to soak up carbon dioxide at an extreme rate while also having high reproducibility in crop yields."

UpliftingNews,3chx5f,itlow,5,Wed Jul 8 15:21:34 2015 UTC,"I've got some history with plastic injection molding. Lego plastic is a much higher quality material. As you recycle plastic, it degrades. The more you melt it, the worse it gets. Plus there is the fact that there are a huge variety of different polymer plastics, and not all of them are suitable for lego use. Bags are made of HDPE, which is just about the lowest quality plastic there is. I'm not entirely sure what Lego uses, but I'd assume it's virgin ABS. Mixing polymers like that is bad, structurally speaking. I never got into the hard chemistry of plastic, but I'd assume that HDPE and ABS would make a very brittle ABS.  Lego seems to have refined their process to the point that I have never seen evidence of a runner  on their pieces, and very rarely am I even able to catch flow lines. Mixing recycled material into that would cause their quality to plummet so hard and fast that it would leave a crater."

UpliftingNews,3chx5f,flatcurve,3,Wed Jul 8 15:38:12 2015 UTC,What's with all the hate on grocery bags recently? They're recyclable in my area.
UpliftingNews,3chx5f,seaturtleonahighway,35,Wed Jul 8 13:23:42 2015 UTC,"Polyethylene bags aren't desirable as a post-consumer raw material. Every time you melt a thermoplastic resin, some of the long-chain molecules break down. This means the plastic itself degrades and looses strength and durability. So we try to avoid actually melting the plastic until we need to. To recycle things like detergent bottles and milk jugs, after thoroughly cleaning them and removing any metal particles, we grind them up into pellets that will simply get put back into the screw extruder on an injection molding machine. The problem with bags is that you can't really process them into anything that can be used like that. You'd have to melt them down to get the resin thick enough to be ground up. By the time you've done that you've basically ruined the plastic. So in most cases, the bags get chopped up and mixed with some fresh resin and sawdust. This gets heated up and extruded to make composite lumber for things like railroad ties, decks and playgrounds. However the demand for composite lumber is too low to take a noticeable dent out of the plastic bag waste stream."

UpliftingNews,3chx5f,Derwos,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:45:59 2015 UTC,"I think their point is that the process of producing their plastic from oil results in carbon polution from waste products and energy consumption ... not from the decay of legos in the environment.  If they can find a way of producing plastic from an agricultural source or from some microbial process, then instead of digging carbon up out of the ground and releasing it into the environment, they would instead be subtracting carbon from the air and sequestering it into their toys, thereby achieving a dramatic improvement in their net carbon footprint.  Sunlight would be the major power source in such a process.  Moreover, if they do develop a sufficiently efficient process, then many other plastics producers could benefit the environment by taking advantage of this process as well.  The net benefit to society could be much greater than what a single toy company might achieve alone.  If we were properly charging carbon poluters for the eventual cost of carbon polution that we will all have to pay anyway, then that could go a long way toward balancing the real economic cost of plastics production and could make whatever process they come up with quite economically feasible."

Things that are not acceptable to be made of oil based plastic: product packaging, grocery bags, ""disposable"" cutlery (or anything ""disposable"" for that matter), beverage bottles, etc...   I find nothing wrong with using oiled based plastic for things you throw out. So long as it's disposed of properly it is fine. It's oil. You dug it out the earth, and put it back in. Is that a big deal?  The problems from plastic arise when they're not disposed of right. Like when Asian countries throw plastic into the ocean, and then that harms wild life. That stuff is bad."

They might be able to fudge the numbers to look like they've made an enormous reduction but I'm betting their final report to the public won't consider things like deforestation for ag development, pesticide pollution, etc. Considering a lego block's usable lifetime as a carpet landmine is something like 100 years, the carbon per unit per year of usable life number is already pretty darn good."

UpliftingNews,3chx5f,QuinteX1994,9,Wed Jul 8 09:54:46 2015 UTC,"According to this site     More than 400 billion Lego bricks have been produced since 1958. There are about 62 Lego bricks per person of the Earth's population     And according to this site, a brick weighs under 2 grams.     which would mean 800,000 metric tons of bricks total. A barrel of oil weighs about 125 kg, so all the bricks produced would weight about the same as 6.4 million barrels of oil. This site states that 94 million barrels of oil are produced each day.

Lego is massively speeding up production and in 2015 Q1 when i was there, the official number used at lego HQ in billund was 91 per person.   The brick are ofcourse of various sizes and weights, but i guess its all about how much we individually think is negligible.   Also, the production of legos require massively more oil than what is inside the brick itself even though alot of it is reused. Not gonna list all the different things that use oil from raw material to finished brick but i assume you can atleast get what i mean.  Point is though, i personally dont think its negligible, niether does lego appearantly. And if lego comes up with a good solution, it should and probably will, quickly spread since other companies are working with the same issues.

Should they find a suitable alternative, there are more than likely a number of other organisations that also produce high quality injection molded plastic products that would be interested in a non-oil based alternative that would meet the same quality standards of a company like Lego.

If you make them out of a different material, you run the risk of the plastic behaving slightly differently over time and them not working with each other anymore.   Not to mention that they also run the risk of having to retool their entire factory. When you're working with tolerances that small, any slight variation in the process could throw everything off. Maybe one piece prints perfect using still the old formula. Another piece might print slightly wrong. Then before you know it, you have so many defective Lego pieces in the wild that don't quite work how they are supposed to"

Companies know how to make plastic, its not a trade secret. So i would like to think lego would be willing to share their discovery with other companies when they finally do find an alternative."

Sometimes people think ""I'm going to beat his ass twice as bad"" if there's any repercussion that comes down on them for their behavior, regardless of how merciful or forward thinking it is.  I sure as hell know that I got sucker punched in the gut in a hallway for taking the high road talking to a school counselor in response to bullying. And the kid might have been thinking ""I'm gonna beat his as twice as bad"" after the fight that followed, but high school ended before that ever happened.  There's no simple way to deal with bullying like this. You can take the moral high road and pray that it makes a difference - and to some kids that are in a bad place in life and need some humanization to save them, it will work. I've seen that side of the situation, too. And if you're optimistic, maybe you try that every time and ignore the times it fails.  On the other hand, some people are total pieces of shit and your best bet is to make them think twice about taking advantage of you long enough to get out of the situation and not have to deal with them anymore.

You can teach all the compassion in the world, all the ideals of loving each other and there will be a ton of people that reject it.  Why? Because humans naturally want to be competitive and superior than one another.    Am I saying we shouldn't deal with it? No. It's a damn issue when people start getting injuries and lead to suicide from it.  But I do agree with you on this, I support harsh punishments for people caught bullying, provided that no tolerance bullshit is taken off.  And my version of harsh is just a tend different:  6 months... of sensitivity training or something.  Break the bully's habit forcibly. Send him/her to tour prison (not a jail), see what that kind of potential behavior could lead them.  Educate them... on their free time after school for an hour or two and force participation.  I'm a firm believer that if you want people to be taught, you need to make an example of them if they're unwilling."
UpliftingNews,3ch3mw,macCSreddit,9,Wed Jul 8 05:17:33 2015 UTC,"Because humans naturally want to be competitive and superior than one another.   This is not true for everyone and is certainly not true for all times in all people. Once you get past a certain point in brain development and in addition have some life experience you tend to think more like what is called a ""mature adult"". Not only that, but some kids can understand that always trying to one-up other people is either fruitless or immoral from churches, and/or from personal experience.   I personally also am autistic, just like the kid in the article, and was bullied the whole school year, every year until I got to college, I also was the lightest weight girl in my 5th grade class, and not all that tall either; there is no way that punching a bully back was either feasible or practical at any point in my schooling, ever. The only way I ""escaped"" bullies was by reading and hiding as much as I could; the hiding also consisted of being inconspicuous and non-responsive/boring , in addition to physical hiding. I felt that bullies were disgusting people with childish solutions to the problems [popularity, generalized anger, a lack of empathy].  If I was not one to always try to be better than others in their eyes, then so can other kids and other people. Long-term work on preventing and treating bullies is changing culture in general so bullying would never be considered cool no matter your age in school [or as parents/leaders/role-models].   We as a society have relegated so many very common things to the very margins of society, like dog-fighting, for example. Bear-bull baiting, public torture and executions, superstitious witch trials, other societal trends quashed by science. Bullying can be part of this societal banishment of inhumanity. In the mean time, it makes no sense to right a wrong with further wrongs; children see the hypocrisy of this and hopefully most of their parents will get a clue as well  [like outlawing all spanking/physical punishment; it contradicts modern child development science and has been show to be damaging to children in controlled double blind studies.It leads to a kid thinking that physical violence is a proper solution to ""what ails ya""-- I have the link to the study in a comment I made in /r/AITA today-- the question about a stranger hitting their child in public, of course.]."
UpliftingNews,3ch3mw,helpprogram2,2,Wed Jul 8 06:09:52 2015 UTC,"There are a LOT of generalizations flying around this thread. But I will offer a counterpoint to yours.  When I was in middle school some kid used to bully me all the time and I just didn't resist. Not severe beatings just harassment, shoving, maybe the occasional punch thrown. One day I saw him walking over and I decided to fight back, took him totally off guard, I grabbed him and tripped him to the ground and took a couple cheap shots while he was lying there.  From then on he was nothing but chummy towards me and somewhere in high school we became sorta friends.  Bullying is sort of an umbrella that is used to catch a lot of ""normal"" teen aggression - by ""normal"" I mean that if you don't do something to prevent or correct it, it's inevitable.  Sometimes aggressive behavior is as simple as kids sorting out a hierarchy / pecking order. Kids bully each other and the ones who never get their asses kicked end up being the more popular kids. Kick the popular kid's ass and you move up the hierarchy."

A good starter would be ""the psychopath test"" book by jon ronson that outlines the diagnosis, and what the extreme range is for people who are in normal roles, not just in prisons"", and how they started out in schools and families, learning what was normal, what was hand-waived off by their culture, or not, etc.  Society, rewards those people who can find a useful outlet for those traits we'd find personally offensive, like sadism, violence, cruelty, selfishness, authority, manipulation, etc. Wether that's the CFO or CEO, guards, lawyers, criminologists, journalist, the arbiters of other's lives are often people who think differently about others and are complimented by society for their successes, or shunned and imprisoned for their failures.   Some of this is covered under the MAOA ""warrior / serial killer"" hype, but yes, the dark triad is something everyone in their life has to learn about and acknowledge, far more than the archetype of good or evil, are narcissists, sociopaths, sadists, and the signs of charm or manipulativeness, anti-social or anti-empathy leading to psychopathy in children, teens and adults."

I think what has come to be known as the stigma of mental health disorders is only partly to do with it being stigmatized and partly to do with psychology being a young field. A lot of people doubt certain diagnoses being correct or the existence of the condition being diagnosed for several reasons, and we shouldn't dismiss those reasons simply because we consider mental health too important, a common example being aspergers. Not only was it excluded from the DSM, but there are many people who would have argued that it is pretty much make believe before that. I personally think there's some good reason to believe it, but I also have my doubts and think that at least the science is young on the topic, in the sense that there's no one-to-one correspondence in brain structures of aspies to differentiate them from ""neurotypical"" ones."

I was bullied all through middle school and high school, even beat up (pretty unusual for a girl to get beat up at my school). I found it difficult to maintain relationships, especially with people who would pick on anything that made you different. Instead I learned to be hostile in response, and had trouble making friends for a long time, even with good people.  I think this guy deserves a lot of respect. I would not have been able to make that kind of choice in high school. I would have likely lashed out and pressed charges and tried to fuck them over out of spite. Looking at that damage, they would have deserved anything coming to them. But he's a much better person than me, and it's good to know that there are actually people like that. Hopefully this incident can help raise more awareness of high functioning social disorders. Poor kid."
UpliftingNews,3ch3mw,BoundingBorder,47,Wed Jul 8 01:06:43 2015 UTC,"I had the same experience, my bullying started in 5th grade. Eventually I just shut everyone out and stopped talking at school. I started dressing mean so people wouldn't even bother trying to talk to me. I was told a lot in the beginning that I was annoying and that no one wanted to be around me. I had a single friend who I later found out was the start of a lot of things. At her birthday, I over heard her telling people that I was weird and that she only hung out with me because she felt sorry for me but she was my only ""friend"" so I acted like I didn't know. She once sent a guy an email from my address, which had my name in it, confessing my supposed love for someone I didn't even know, I didn't figure it out until 10 years later. That guy made an act of asking me out in front of everyone before yelling ""not!"" and telling the entire grade about the email. I never believed anyone would want to be around me and suspected any interest as a trick after that. I didn't date, ended up in a relationship with someone who cheated on me constantly but I stayed with him because I thought he was the only one who would want me. I've never told my husband that I knew my ex was cheating on me all along, I'm still ashamed of that one. He doesn't understand the extent of the bullying, how it affected my self esteem and kept me from having any interactions with people. The self esteem problem still gets between us sometimes and my mind starts telling me that he thinks bad things about me even though he's never shown any hint of thinking those things. I still have problems talking to people, I get social anxiety to the point that I sometimes begin shaking if I have to talk to someone. My biggest problem is that I have a son and I know that any friends that he makes will have parents that wont want their kid around a weirdo but as hard as I try, I just can't come off as normal. I worry I'm going to screw him up.  Just to be clear, I also have aspergers.   WTF? who even says that shit?"

I never believed anyone would want to be around me and suspected any interest as a trick after that.   I used to say that ""having complete strangers harass you"" was the worst piece of bullying I can think of (I have had a number of people who I never interacted with, some of which weren't even in my grade, harass me while calling me by my name), but now I think the idea of ""pretending to like you"" may actually be worse."
UpliftingNews,3ch3mw,taboo_,8,Wed Jul 8 04:36:55 2015 UTC,"""I can't believe she actually thought I would date her"". It kinda screwed me up actually. I had 3 guy friends ask me out on different occasions and I said no to all of them because of it, we often stopped talking afterwards. It was easier being friends with guys because they weren't so quick to see you as weird. One friend, I talked to him often on the phone, he called me to ask me out one day but was nervous and called with a friend. That friend was also part of the original trick so I thought at the least, he saw it as a good laugh."
UpliftingNews,3ch3mw,BoundingBorder,29,Wed Jul 8 04:57:17 2015 UTC,I didn't get beaten up but I was verbally harassed a lot through school. Never fit in and found a place I could be comfortable with. Spent more time in high school trying to figure everything out than studying. Stupid teen agers kept changing the rules.
UpliftingNews,3ch3mw,taboo_,18,Wed Jul 8 01:51:10 2015 UTC,Right? Seems like more time was spent trying to figure out what would make me seem the most normal rather than actually accomplishing things.
UpliftingNews,3ch3mw,BoundingBorder,5,Wed Jul 8 01:57:13 2015 UTC,"I'm really not trying to downplay the problems people with Asperger's have, but there are so many kids without it having plenty of problems in High School - High School can be a really terrible place! :("
UpliftingNews,3ch3mw,LikeASchnook,7,Wed Jul 8 07:09:09 2015 UTC,"Can I ask how aspergers affects someone like this kid on a daily basis? I have a rudimentary understanding of the condition, but from the article it made him sound like he's unable to pick up on social cues etc. But clearly he, and you through reading your response are very capable of empathising. So, what kind of situations does this lead to? Is it just a lot of misunderstandings or what? I'm just trying to draw a connection between what was described about his condition by the article and the emotional states of someone going through that.  Edit: please excuse any misconceptions I may have. I mean no offense. Just find it interesting."
UpliftingNews,3ch3mw,TearOfACompoundEye,26,Wed Jul 8 04:48:12 2015 UTC,"Empathy can be developed in situations you have experience in, but the disorder is different for everyone. There is also a huge difference between men and women with the disorder. Women have an easier time acting as a chameleon and blending in socially, and tend to pick up social cues a litter faster. A lot of girls aren't diagnosed until later on, and boys tend to be diagnosed earlier.  For me, I can't read expressions. I can't pick up on passive aggressive cues, I can't tell when someone is beginning to get irritated with me. I tend to over-explain things because I have a compulsion to be thorough and I want to know absolutely everything. The way this seems to come off to neurotypical people is that I'm being condescending, that I'm just annoying or I'm being rude on purpose.  On a daily basis I piss people off for behaviors I can't control, and an inability to read others. You have absolutely no idea how much you pick up on in body language and expression. Those cues are completely unavailable to me and I have to rely on mimicry to get by. Movies and literature are huge resources for what to say in the right moment.  When I was first going through diagnosis I had to take a test over a few hours on identifying social cues. Essentially, I was asked to look at a photograph and derive a story from it. What do you think is happening in this photo? There is a set of answers that people could come up with like: This woman is mad at this man, possibly over the broken dish in the background. Being unable to read emotions on faces makes it nearly impossible to tell what is actually going on in a photograph. They take it away after about 20 seconds, as this is all a normal person needs to take stock of a social situation and react. I failed every single photograph. I was at a complete loss, with no idea what was going on.  It is difficult to explain to someone as a lot of the traits of aspergers can be so minute that many people can go undiagnosed. A lot of it involves just feeling alienated and abnormal, completely unable to understand other people and they tend to hate you for it.  But that's just the social aspect. There are things that people with aspergers get very anxious over, to the point of a stress meltdown. Mine is loud sounds. You would think I have ptsd or something. Yelling, banging, shrill sounds, children screaming. These things make me incredibly freaked out, and when I reach a high point of stress I go under my desk and hide for an hour or two until I calm down. Fourth of July was incredibly stressful as all of my neighbors were setting off fireworks right outside. My service dog helps to calm me in a lot of situations, and is trained to guide me away from stressors. But the 4th was too much, and I had to take a sedative to get by.  Aspergers has such a wide range of traits, and it's not all just social. They coincide with a lot of other traits of autism, which is why it is now included in Autism Spectrum Disorder. For a kid in school, if you start getting nervous every time a door slams, you become a target very quickly. If you aren't sympathetic enough to Brad and Jesse's breakup, you're an asshole. If you say something bluntly that you don't know you're not supposed to say, you're rude and a sociopath.   I feel like this answer is just barely a glimpse into aspergers. To put it simply, our minds work way differently than yours. And people tend to assume that you're just not a nice person, or you're weird and unsociable, or that you're crazy."
UpliftingNews,3ch3mw,BoundingBorder,4,Wed Jul 8 06:19:59 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your insight. That was all very well written. And I'm sorry you have to experience that. Despite not being able to read other's emotions, do you yourself experience a full range of normal emotions in similar ways, for similar reasons to other people? I can see how not being able to read when someone else is going through something emotional could be misconstrued as you being cold and not being able to experience those emotions yourself. If that a fair assessment?  Also, do you find things like written communication and, say texting/chatting easier as it relies less on body language and more on being explicit to convey feelings?"
UpliftingNews,3ch3mw,t0liman,7,Wed Jul 8 06:32:10 2015 UTC,"I don't display emotions very readily. I do feel a full range of emotions, but my reactions may not be necessarily typical, or it may take longer for me to process emotions. I find myself very easily stressed if things happen within my safe bubble (my home, myself) but things that happen outside of it I couldn't care less about. Things like tests or homework never bothered me much, and I am pretty neutral to death. My phone got ran over a car and I immediately went on the logical path to fixing it rather than stressing. But when things get out of my control, I become extremely stressed and anxious.  So yes, people often think I'm a cold person. My family thought so for a while too, especially when they found my lack of reactions to family deaths a little disconcerting.   I have always found letters and text much easier to communicate with. I do a lot of communication of the feelings I have difficulty explaining, such as alienation, through literature. I obtained an English degree pretty easily. When dating people they often think I have a lot of ""game"" because online dating, tinder, and texting is a modern staple of dating. But once they get to know me better in person there's a pretty obvious disparity. Often my most meaningful conversations are through text now. If I have something to get off my chest, I text my friend a couple pages instead of sitting on the phone with her. It's much easier."
UpliftingNews,3ch3mw,Lokabf3,5,Wed Jul 8 06:59:41 2015 UTC,"One of the biggest misconceptions about Aspergers is that we don't feel emotions (I also have it) or lack empathy. We do feel a wide range of emotions for the most part, the problem is mainly with expressing them properly, controlling them, and identifying them in other people, and that a lot of that has to be learned rather than developed naturally. If a loved one is very sad about something, for instance, we often feel that sadness with them but it's mostly kept inside, and the lack of outward expression makes you seem cold or uncaring. And if you don't learn facial expressions, body language, social cues etc. you will have a hard time picking up on how others are feeling, and that can make it difficult for you to express yourself. As far as controlling emotions, we can get overly happy/sad/angry about things (or not enough) and can come off certain ways to people that we didn't intend. But the important thing is the emotions are there and we are not all paychopaths or sociopaths.   This all sounded convoluted to me but I hope it makes sense! This should not be taken as a blanket statement on all people with Aspergers but this is at least my own experience."
UpliftingNews,3ch3mw,spellfencer,4,Wed Jul 8 11:39:31 2015 UTC,"okay, how about we turn this round... what if the problem isn't with you, but with everyone who isn't Asperger's...   tell us what you think our problem is...  ALSO:  do you ever guess what's going on in other people's heads?"
UpliftingNews,3ch3mw,countess_meow,8,Wed Jul 8 09:44:51 2015 UTC,"Oh cool, let's lash out a bit.  Your expectations for polite conversation are completely unreasonable. I ask what I deem to be logical questions, I try to state things that I think or feel as clearly as possible. I expect you to do the same. Questions don't ever offend me, and I wish people to be clear and honest with me. I don't get offended by any of these things, why are you getting angry with me rather than explaining clearly why what I said was wrong?  Stop judging me on my hobbies. I prefer spending time with my dogs and playing video games or reading books alone in my quiet home. I spend hours researching domestic animals or computers or things I collect. It doesn't affect you, stop trying to call me OCD or tell me I have a problem and need to get out more. I like me the way I am. I don't need to go to concerts or bars, I don't need to meet people. I'm fine.  Don't assume that I'm stupid or mentally challenged. I just can't read people and get anxious about some things.   Don't assume I'm a genius or savant because I'm autistic. I'm extremely knowledgeable in areas that interest me and people mistake me for being very intelligent. I'm normal, and I failed geometry in high school. Stop asking how well I play the saxophone or if I can paint.  Get your kids away from me. I don't hate kids, they freak me the hell out. Don't get pissed that I want nothing to do with your precious angel or that I'm blunt and talk to them like an adult. I don't have children for a reason. Stop telling me I'm going to change my mind, or how great your kid is. They stress me out and I don't want them anywhere near me.  Please acknowledge that I have a legitimate neurological difference, not a deficit. I have every reason to excuse myself from a situation that does not mesh well with me, and you have every right not to have to accommodate for my issues. Your birthday bash includes going to the club? I'm sorry, I'll do whatever comes first then excuse myself before you go there. Don't take offense to me doing what's best for me.  Those are just the top of my list. I never know what's in people's heads, other than their brain."
UpliftingNews,3ch3mw,Retr0man,3,Wed Jul 8 10:15:28 2015 UTC,"Most often, you miss social cues that people think are transparent or obvious. like interest. or boredom. sometimes, if you're adapted (through coaching) you can learn responses, greetings, what ""open"" or ""closed"" looks like and how to respond to people and indirect / obtuse questions.   social coaching is sort of interesting, i did a course called ""toastmasters"" as a teenager on public speaking, which taught a lot about how to observe social cues and body language, and that was mind-blowing at the time, noting gaze, tone, brevity, and sarcasm, and how to push or pull attention away from you using gestures,etc.   lots of stuff that was apparently ""normal"", seemed to make more sense.   when to start or stop talking.  what to say when embarassed or being berated by people,  when to talk, when to let a look say what you want instead, etc. when a smile is helpful or condescending, how and what ""paying attention"" looks like in body language, etc.  As a kid, Double negatives are a minefield when in an argument, because you're being forced to answer loud questions directly. etc.  so you get this kind of response / answer to germane / deliberately obtuse questions.  ""Do you know what you did ?"" ""i'm not sure"" ""do you think this is funny"" ""not yet ?"" ""do you know what time it is ?"" ""about 10:23, i'd have to look at the clock that's behind me though""    ""why are you late?"" ""i don't know, i just got here""    ""can you get here any later ?"" ""i can try... ""  the other thing is reading cues and sarcasm the utterly wrong way because humour works a little bit differently. sniggering or finding it funny, or just being uncomfortable with people lying, delivering a precise answer when a casual or wrong answer would be fine.   My school friends think it was hilarious that i backtalked my maths teacher for being a few minutes late, i had to spend 10 minutes outside in the hallway with no idea of what i had done until days later."

Thanks :)"
UpliftingNews,3ch3mw,BoundingBorder,40,Wed Jul 8 03:56:00 2015 UTC,"My daughter has aspergers.   She is a delightful, happy, smart girl.  She loves to read, and had finished the entire Harry Potter series when she was 7.  She's creative, and loves to draw, and in the last couple years has gotten into writing fan-fiction.    She does well in school, and can carry on great conversations.  But... she almost worships rules.  If something is supposed to be done a certain way, and other people do things differently, it's difficult for her.   If she's playing a game, and someone cheats, it upsets her greatly.    She is clumsy and will never be an overly athletic girl... the running joke is that if you throw a ball in her general direction, it'll hit her in the head (and it usually does).  When meeting new people, she has trouble looking at them in the eye.  She doesn't know what to say sometimes, or will launch into a conversation that the other person is clueless about, and won't recognize the body language that says she's boring the other person.   Things that other kids find funny, she'll find dumb.    Jokes that she makes, other kids won't understand.  She didn't understand the importance of her physical appearance or hygiene.  It took us a long time to drill it into her how important it was.   But now, she can't go to sleep without a shower, because she knows that's ""the rule"".    If you explain something to her, she understands it, but she will take it literally.   If you explain something slightly incorrectly, but in a way that most people would just get... nope, she'll take you literally.    Sometimes when she's doing something wrong, we have to correct her teachers, not her, since she listened too well.  But probably the toughest part about this is that she's an incredibly sweet girl who just wants to be happy, and make other people happy.  But, because she doesn't pick up on those social queues, likes to be alone, loves geeky things that the cool people thing are... geeky... well, people don't give her a chance and get to know her.   They just think she's the weird girl, and... well, you know what kids to to the weird kid.  We do what we can to help her with it, but the toll on her is hard.   It's affecting her sense of self worth, and how she feels about herself.   It makes her think negative thoughts, makes her feel empty and unwanted, and it's difficult to help her through that, because, we can't change how other people treat her.  Having Aspergers is being a person who other people just don't get, and then taking the fallout that results, even though they never did anything wrong that they knew of.  Hopefully she'll make it through all of this and be able to use the gifts that aspergers gives her.. her sense of right, her intelligence, her focus... and her life will end up good.   Only time will tell."
UpliftingNews,3ch3mw,NEREVAR117,10,Wed Jul 8 04:28:13 2015 UTC,"Every thing you said is something I have done all of my life, but I was never diagnosed with anything... I feel weird now."
UpliftingNews,3ch3mw,Deliziosax,2,Wed Jul 8 04:54:07 2015 UTC,"Same. I was reading through it and thinking how it sounded just like me growing up. I don't think I have Asperger's or anything like that, but it is interesting to read. I've always had a fixation with order and cleanliness. My doctor thinks I need to see a therapist because he says I almost certainly have OCD and it causes me a lot of anxiety. I get anxious for silly reasons ... the TV or radio volume not being an even number or a multiple of five, things not being symmetrical (or asymmetrical, depending on what it is), something being ""off"" in my closet ... and that is also the reason I only wear solid colors and absolutely nothing with print (unless the print is hidden when hanging up). My closet is organized with everything on certain color plastic hangers (white for tops, silver for coats, black for dresses, etc) and then the clothing is organized by the visible light spectrum. Because of that, I'm always having this internal battle of where to place the black and white pieces, which are most of my wardrobe. I had them with white first, then colors, then black. Recently changed it to colors, then white, grey, black. Things like that can cause me anxiety, but I'm okay with it. It gets to be a problem when I'm with someone else and they change the TV volume to something like 17. I don't want to say anything, but it takes over my brain to the point I can't focus and start feeling ill. Luckily, the good obsessive issues I have outweigh the bad... I don't think any of the anxiety I get from it is bad enough that I need medication or a doctor. If it is OCD that I have, I just consider myself lucky that I don't really have the rituals. I do deal with the ""intrusive thoughts"" ... but they are so minor and weird that they don't bother me either. I can completely understand why some people would feel the need for medications if they had the scarier thoughts, though."
UpliftingNews,3ch3mw,LoveMyPuggle,2,Wed Jul 8 06:12:31 2015 UTC,"My anxiety prevented me from leaving my house for nearly 8 years from 18-26 I barely went anywhere or did anything and developed pretty bad agoraphobia but one of the things that still bug me to this day is the volume on the TV, odd numbers are a big no no for me unless they are duplicates such as 11 or 33. My sister and her husband turned the volume up and it landed on an odd number and they refused to change it and I had to leave the room. Still haunts me. Thanks to medication and meditation and seeing a life coach the last 2 years I've gotten out the house, been working the whole time and made a few friends. Still can't go out without feeling like I'm gonna throw up but I'm pushing myself."

UpliftingNews,3ch3mw,redditguy1515,8,Wed Jul 8 08:06:58 2015 UTC,"If it's not too much trouble, what is it actually like to have aspergers? Sorry of this is insensitive, that's not my intention,   For starters, I'm pretty incapable of finding questions insensitive. A question is a search for an answer, and I like having all the answers. People were constantly annoyed with me asking too many inappropriate or insensitive questions as a kid.  As a female with aspergers, my traits are a bit different than the typical aspie male. I feel that I'm a pretty well adjusted adult, but every day I struggle to appear normal.  I am constantly stepping on people's toes by being unable to read facial expressions and pick up cues that someone is annoyed, stressed, angry, that I'm saying something wrong, etc. I am very monotone and blunt, and that always sets people off even though I never intend to be rude. I can't smile when I'm stressed, I had to force myself to smile as a child to appear normal. I practiced laughing to try and get it right, I practiced facial expressions to try and seem like I was normal. Every minute social cue that you can pick up to read a situation is completely beyond me. I rely on practice with expressions on flashcards.  I take things at face value. I'm easily messed with and manipulated. Many traits of mine appear similar to OCD. I have extreme interest in my hobbies and find it very difficult to make small talk, but go overboard when talking about something I like. If you say ""Oh, you like salamanders?"" I'll probably still be ranting about my favorite genus ten minutes later.  Loud noises bother me. Screaming children make my heart race and I want to hide under something and plug my ears. I take sedatives for fourth of July. I can't understand children and having to talk to them is a huge source of anxiety for me. When I get extremely stressed, which happens pretty easily after 8 hours of working with people, I tend to huddle under my desk once I get home. I don't like to leave my house, but will do so with a friend or my service dog.  Making friends is very difficult. I only have two people that I consider friends. It's difficult to maintain meaningful relationships when people don't know how to interact with you and there are constant misunderstandings. Passive aggression goes over my head, so I require high levels of communication. You need to tell my exactly what you are feeling and why you are feeling it and what you require of me. I'll do the same for you.  Maintaining romantic relationships can be difficult. I don't ask many meaningful questions and I don't say anything if I don't know what to say, so people often take that as a sign of disinterest. Or on some things I'm overly communicative and people find that stifling. It depends on the person. I have a lot of ""quirks"" and I seem to have found a good place in a relationship with someone who has pretty severe OCD.   That's a pretty reductive summary of what I experience daily. Everyone on the spectrum experiences the disorder in their own way. I have always felt like an alien. I'd love to be able to have one good day without having a stressful social interaction or something setting me off. I feel like I'm constantly walking on glass trying to go through life appearing normal. In an ideal world I wouldn't have to, but very few people understand aspergers and many think of it as ""Well, you appear normalish. Can't you just get over it? Can't you just put yourself in someone else's shoes? Cant you work on your anxiety?""   And the answer is no. I can't put myself in anyone else's shoes. I hate that phrase. I've heard it my entire life. I have no idea what it is like to be anyone else, nor do I have any ability to try and understand through cues that you give. I can't get over my anxiety. I've already worked on it a ton. I'm not going to get over my inability to read others. Even with working on social training for over a year I see no improvement. At this point I just want others to accept me for what I am or leave me be. I prefer my dogs over people anyway, and I like spending time with myself. I have two really good friends and a girlfriend, and that's more than enough for me."
UpliftingNews,3ch3mw,zackmanze,11,Wed Jul 8 06:47:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not the person you responded to but I also have Asperger syndrome. This is a higher-functioning part of the autistic spectrum. We're relatively normal, but generally disfavor social relationships outside of family (sometimes just close family). It varies a lot though from person to person. Keep in mind it's difficult summarizing your overall life experience, however I will try my best.  Personally, I don't find the average person to be worth bonding with. Social customs and behavior are very strange things; often being illogical and poorly developed. I'm very selective of who I would call my friends, but I'm very loyal to and respect them because they're good and intelligent people. But outside of that select group I don't usually care to hang out with people. I don't dislike being around people, I just find it incredibly boring most of the time. I would rather be home reading a good book than go to a bar or club or some get-together to get drunk. That sounds awful.  I'm the kind of person that when you meet and try to talk to, I'll bring up the subject of world history or black holes. It makes interacting with people either boring or very awkward as I either have to tone down the subject of discussion or attempt to break things down so they understand and/or become interested. It very rarely works. I've always been interested in the academics, especially science, and as a child I would ramble all day about the latest things I've read.  There are numerous smaller factors involved with having Aspergers. For example I can recite various key, detailed facts on the spot yet I have trouble remembering simple directions. A common issue was my mother telling me to wash towels or clothes, but I would forget what specific settings each different type of cloth had to be set to. I still don't (with certainty) remember what settings to use for towels. I had to write everything down on a piece of paper and tape it above the laundry machine and drier.  I can rapidly count objects in most systems. You know those competitions where they had a large number of items in a jar and whoever got the closest guess won? I was a pro at those. A jar would have 764 marbles in it and I would guess 760. I can look at a brick wall and almost instantly know how many bricks are there. Sometimes with math I'll somehow know the answer, even to advanced algebraic problems. I actually failed a math course in college because my professor thought I was cheating. I told her I was autistic, but she didn't care. Bitch.  We like repetitive things. I can listen to the same song a hundred times in a row or play Minecraft for 12 hour straight just mining or building. I'll often count by touching my thumbs to my other fingers in a sequence to create patterns. Autistic people have a constant need to use their hands, so I'll almost always be messing with whatever small objects are nearby.  Mostly the biggest issue is that no one seems to understand me. I find people to (usually) be too immature and emotional. I prefer logic and reason, and this often creates big misunderstandings in even basic conversations. It's very frustrating dealing with people, and in that regard I do wish I could more easily connect with people. Especially trying to get with women. Seriously, being autistic and trying to get a girlfriend is like climbing up Mount Everest without legs."

It's the state that prosecutes you, not the victim and sometimes the state prosecutes despite the victim's wishes to the contrary.  In this instance, I imagine (complete conjecture, take with grain of salt) that the state may have figured ""hey, that seems like a good punishment that could actually reform these guys"" and offered it as a deal to the attackers in lieu of prosecuting them with the possibility of jail time. Once again, no idea what REALLY went down, but the bullies were likely given a choice between the victims proscribed punishment, or facing punishment from the state."

Nobody in authority is willing to step in until the victim is either seriously injured or the victim plans a retribution.  Then all of a sudden the victim is the evil one and the bullies get away with it (if the victim fails to kill them).  Kid in my high school was a bully and then he died in a drunken car wreck.  Everyone was soooooo sad even though they knew he was an asshole.  And if you were mercilessly bullied by him and stated he was a dick, you were looked at as if you were the devil incarnate.

UpliftingNews,3ch3mw,Shrewd_GC,7,Wed Jul 8 08:23:30 2015 UTC,"To all those skeptical that this light sentencing will have an effect on the bullies I want to point out two things.   They are teenagers and the one thing ego-centeric teens do care about is their ""rep"" with other teens. Teens live in the center of their own little worlds. This has gone viral. Everyone in their word sees them as bullies now and can see what they did to that poor boy. (Most bullies do not see themselves as bullies and express shock at getting the label that clearly deserve)  Our whole juvenile justice system is based on the idea that kids can change and are not helped by the stupid mistakes of youth going on a permanent record. But the internet is forever and though the bullies names are not in the news everyone in the school/town knows who they are and what they did.    I don't think they got off easy. This will follow them even after the news cycle has moved on.   I do not think they will feel this is a light sentence and I do not think they will dare lay a finger on him again.  Publicly has its own kind of peer pressure."
UpliftingNews,3ch3mw,Fonzel,6,Wed Jul 8 11:07:57 2015 UTC,"My college roommate had Aspergers. Let me tell you about people with this condition... They are some of the most disarming, loyal, good people that you will ever encounter. A lot of what they don't understand, the nuanced things about modern day social interaction, are things that we shouldn't be doing in the first place. Being sarcastic, cruel, and mean spirited. All of those things go over their heads completely. It is as if they wonder why you aren't just behaving the way you are supposed to. It is refreshing and if you give them the opportunity, they will change your perspective on a lot of things that you have done in the past. They will make you a better person, my friend did that for me.   My old roommate will be one of my close friends for life. We came from two different paths in life, I played football in college and sports my whole life and he was an avid gamer and Japanophile. We were completely different. I met him at a party. I was playing beer pong with a mutual friend and we watched my buddy look at a girl, we saw the wheels turning in his head as to how to approach her, he takes a pull of Jack, and starts to walk up to her... And then he does an immediate about face, walks back to his Jack, rips it again, and shrugs. I asked our mutual friend wtf that was, he explained that he had Aspergers, what that meant, and we made a deal right then to take him under our wing and teach him the social acuity you gain by being a 'jock', I guess you could say. I don't want that to sound like we were saving him, or he needed our help to be normal because that is far from the truth. There was just something about him that draws you in, that seems disarming. He might not have walked up to you and start the conversation at that point, but he just seemed like one of those people that you want in your life, a genuinely good person. It was hands down the best decision I've ever made. I thought we were going to teach him... Boy was I backwards on that one... I mean, don't get me wrong, in 6 months the kid already had enough cajones to ask the head cheerleader to his fraternity formal... Yep, that's right he even joined a frat and ended up being the president his senior year... We didn't make it easy on him, one of us would stir up trouble and then we'd throw him into the middle of it, walk around the corner to watch, and he'd have to work his way out. Turns out, the kid has a knack for saying the exact right thing at the exact right time, and can take a powder keg and turn it into a powder donut. There were struggles, especially in his interactions with girls... But he had such a pure, unadulterated approach to people that no matter how mad the boyfriend was at him for hitting on his GF out of turn, he would always back down to the army behind my buddy. I was far from the only one who cared deeply for his well being. Everyone on campus knew and loved the kid because he was genuine. He didn't lie. He'd give you the shirt off of his back if you needed it and wouldn't give it a second thought... He'd always say 'That is just what you do when people need something.' I would take a bullet for that kid. I have gone to war for him and would do it again without a second thought.   That party was almost 8 years ago and I still talk to him a couple times a week. He graduated, he's extremely bright, he got a job, and he is excelling. I could not be more proud of the person that he has become. I could not be more proud to call him my friend.   This story makes me want to drive to Illinois and teach those little bastards a lesson. They don't need community service as much as they need a good ole fashioned ass whooping, but I sincerely hope that they are able to open their minds and see that different isn't bad, it is just... Different. You can learn a lot more from different than the same. Kudos to the kid for balling up and being a man about it. He may have Aspergers, but just as my friend did, this kid has got the opportunity to forge his own path and do what he truly wants to do. I hope that this experience, as cruel and unfair as it was, gives him the inner fortitude to stand up for himself from now on and get everything he truly wants out of life.   They say people with Aspergers are lucky to have but a few true friends in their lifetime... I'd say people without Aspergers are lucky to have one person with it as a friend in a lifetime. Remember this, kid, you are special and everyone who knows you is lucky to have you in their lives. Never forget that. Ever."

UpliftingNews,3ch3mw,Pongpianskul,13,Fri Jul 10 00:22:27 2015 UTC,"This is a great post and I agree with most of it. The thing is though, you say there isn't context but I think there is still enough to shift blame on the bullies squarely. The situation with the kid is very unlike yours, primarily due to the fact that these were a group of bullies who formed some type of intent,  conspiracy or agreement to attack him, and carried out that attack.   In the law we allow a charge of murder to go down to manslaughter if there is ""adequate provocation"" on the idea that you're not thinking straight and lacked the premeditated to kill. So in this kids situation, he wasn't murdered, but he was basically ambushed by a group of kids who certainly had the requisite maturity to form such intent and carry out an organized attack. This is nothing like your situation. Your actions may have almost been an irresistible impulse to do those things. Such irresistible impulse though, when coupled with intent, planning, and conspiracy, amount to criminal behavior and I don't think more context is needed to see that.   If the aspergers kid said whatever he said to provoke the attack, whatever it was, no words justify the level of violence he suffered, and to top it off, by many more then just one guy.   The context we DO have, imho, is more than sufficient to at least draw out the conclusions above.   I sympathize with your situation, I really do. But it doesn't parallel to this scenario."
UpliftingNews,3ch3mw,DarkGamer,7,Wed Jul 8 08:31:08 2015 UTC,Few others pointed out that I wasn't reading the entire thread chain and wasn't understanding your context.   I apologize for any confusion. I myself am against the death penalty but besides that I agree with everything you just said. Prison system is a joke in our country and there is no rehab effort. Most violent criminals may have some history that triggers them and I sincerely agree that the reasoning behind their actions and perhaps their history must be considered in the sentencing/punishment phase at the least.

UpliftingNews,3ch3mw,hoiyoiyoi,22,Wed Jul 8 14:09:29 2015 UTC,"But there is a victim here.  The victim was beaten pretty severely.  Sure, your story makes sense, there were no victims of physical violence, but in this case there is a clear-cut victim.  There is leeway for some sympathy for the aggressor sometimes, but in this case, they crossed a line.  The victim could have been permanently injured.  I think the fact that the aggressor took it so far as to damage and disfigure the kid does show something about the shitty nature of who they are.  This wasn't taping up the kid to a flagpole, or locking them in a gym locker.  It was beating him while he was on the ground.  That speaks a lot."

UpliftingNews,3ch3mw,UndeadKitten,2,Wed Jul 8 11:38:04 2015 UTC,"Grrrrr.  What a shitty lesson has been learned all around.  The boy who was terribly beaten has learned no one will stand up for him; not his parents and not the law.  It shouldn't even be an option for his parents or him not to press charges.  The evidence is there all over his face and body.    The bullies have learned they can get away with pulverizing this kid's face and no parent, not theirs nor the Aspie boy's parents nor the cops will stand up to them. It isn't taking the high road to do this.  It's about the helplessness and fear and trying to victimize their way out of the situation.  They just want it to go away.  This boy doesn't now and won't ever feel better about doing this.  Yep, he could have expressed his feelings about it in court and perhaps gotten a sense of justice, but this way he gets nothing but further victimization."

The most courageous among us are those who are caring and understanding enough to break the cycle of violence, not perpetuate it."
UpliftingNews,3ch3mw,manazoni1989,8,Wed Jul 8 02:27:13 2015 UTC,Violence can be solved by more violence.  May not be the answer you want but it is always a viable option.
UpliftingNews,3ch3mw,syn3rgyz,17,Wed Jul 8 02:45:20 2015 UTC,"Violence isn't solved by more violence,   Actually, it is in cases of bullying.  I got picked on in middle school, later found a big stick in the woods near the playground, walked up to the kid who was always pushing me around, and cracked him right over the front of his face with it.  No one ever fucked with me after that.   This was after months of trying to avoid them, going to counselors, and dealing with this shit every day in front of everyone. One day the rage built up so much I snapped, and I'd gladly recommend that route to any kid who faces the same situation.  If you don't fight back or make a bigger scene to humiliate the bully, you will forever be the target. Period."
UpliftingNews,3ch3mw,green715,8,Wed Jul 8 03:18:23 2015 UTC,Nobody gave a shit about you until you defended yourself.  Basically how life is.  Nobody is willing to step in unless you are seriously hurt.  They wait until you snap and explode and then treat you like the aggressor.   Sorry that happened to you.  What was the expression on the guys face when you busted a branch over it?
UpliftingNews,3ch3mw,BoundingBorder,7,Wed Jul 8 03:39:14 2015 UTC,"He initially looked shocked. He didn't really know what hit him.  I thought he was going to fight back so I hit him again as hard as I could over his hands as he went to cover his face. I stopped after that because he was on the ground at that point. I threw the stick and walked away.  His lip was cut, he had a huge welt across his face. I got suspended, but they all knew he was asking for it. This was also 1994, so I'd probably get arrested for doing this in today's world."
UpliftingNews,3ch3mw,Basdad,2,Wed Jul 8 00:27:24 2015 UTC,That second hit. You went full 'Ender Wiggin' on him :D  Nice job. Bullies thrive on that feeling that nobody can stand up to them. You broke him.

UpliftingNews,3ch3mw,tribblepuncher,3,Wed Jul 8 02:42:23 2015 UTC,"not always the case, I moved around a lot as a kid and people always tried to bully me for being the new kid. Letting people know you won't just take it and fighting back always worked for me.  Sometimes assholes will forever remain assholes they only know not to fuck with you if they know they are risking their own well being."
UpliftingNews,3ch3mw,DraculaBranson,3,Wed Jul 8 02:58:05 2015 UTC,I'm not too sure. I also have Aspergers and was picked on by some kid as well for a while. Then I punched him in the gut and he left me alone.  Results are results.
UpliftingNews,3ch3mw,jurrieb,6,Wed Jul 8 03:16:24 2015 UTC,"Especially given that the way we learn how to cope and act socially is derived from how we experience being treated. Mirroring is common, and I wish I had a chance to receive proper social training. It is all too easy to think being aggressive in response is appropriate. I think he's a good example of an aspie who will get by just fine. Now that I'm in my twenties I'm a lot more socially adjusted, but seeing a kid younger than me being able to make a decision like that out of goodwill is pretty amazing."

UpliftingNews,3chnwz,gringledoom,26,Wed Jul 8 02:25:00 2015 UTC,To be fair it's the older generation in Greece that caused the situation.  They should have paid their taxes and not made retiring age so low.  Still it's good that this guy will have some help.

UpliftingNews,3chnwz,Hot_Zee,7,Wed Jul 8 13:03:50 2015 UTC,that and governments that outright lied about the debt   They would not have needed to lie if they had not accrued so much.  It really is not much more complicated than /u/margate_mod said.  They spent too much money and did not collect enough taxes.  Fixing just one of those would have helped Greece a great deal.  Hell repealing the income tax and using a VAT only system would have made collection automatic and easier to enforce.

UpliftingNews,3chnwz,jombeesuncle,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:30:00 2015 UTC,"I'm possibly wrong about this..but it's a tax that increments everytime ""value"" is added to a goods or service.  e.g Selling sand would have very little VAT, refining sands into silicon then selling it to chip manufacturer would have more VAT, selling the resulting chip to a retail chain would have even more VAT, and then the retail chain selling it to a computer enthusiast would add an additional layer of VAT. At each step of the process value is added and more and more VAT gets put on. So items that aren't processed much (raw foods, grains etc..) aren't taxed very much but very processed items (meals at a restaurant) get taxed much more."

UpliftingNews,3chnwz,gatorling,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:30:31 2015 UTC,How does the government justify what to me seems like an extreme tax on just about everything.   In Greece's case it is because no one pays income tax and VAT is more difficult to get around so it would improve their tax base and be easier to enforce.   Can you explain VAT as you would to a reasonably intelligent American?    It is basically a tax on the difference between the the value when a business purchased something and the value when they sell it.    Some nations make it simple and just charge a flat rate on all retail sales. In the UK that works out to be about 20% on top of the income tax which to be honest makes me surprised they have not hung every politician by now.

UpliftingNews,3chnwz,riderer,-3,Wed Jul 8 15:14:59 2015 UTC,It's a good day to be a Greek youth. The generation responsible for the bankrupt and destroyed their pensions are actually suffering. Instead of the children being forced to pay for pensions they would never receive themselves.
UpliftingNews,3chnwz,Walktillyoucrawl,48,Wed Jul 8 03:27:53 2015 UTC,You talk as if the Greek elders are different somehow from the youth.   They probably live in the same house.

It isn't a good day for any Greek save maybe a few with marketable commodities readily available for barter.  If anything, the Greek youth will suffer both short and long term from stagnant growth, job prospects, and support structures to enable innovation, investment, and job creation."

UpliftingNews,3chnwz,trtryt,18,Wed Jul 8 02:25:47 2015 UTC,"Not really, it's beneficial for weaker countries to stay in the Euro as it keeps the value of the Euro down. Which is very beneficial for Germany because they export a lot. If all the weaker countries got out of the Euro, the Euro would rise considerably."
UpliftingNews,3chnwz,cromagnum_android,20,Wed Jul 8 03:26:51 2015 UTC,"You have it right. If Germany had Deutschmarks the value of the Deutschmark would skyrocket, killing German exports. The drachma would plummet, subsidizing Greek exports, helping the Greek economy and everything would balance out. Instead Germany captures all of the value of that imbalance - but the German public does not see itself as owing anything in return! German politicians have to carry out naked populist desire to ""punish"" Greece even if it's not in anyone's best interest.  So Europe tried to become more like a single country by doing things in the wrong order. The people don't really consider themselves a country if they want to let another part of the country burn. Michigan wouldn't let everyone in Arizona starve even if they ""deserved"" it somehow. The Euro was a colossal mistake."

It by itself doesn't matter, but it sends a message that maybe it is time to address problems, which politically has a lot of meaning to many groups that feel like they haven't been represented by the government.  The symbol could have been anything, but this specific instance drew attention to the flag so it became that. But whether it is or isn't going to make a difference, it definitely addresses how groups are feeling and are passionate about."

UpliftingNews,3ck1h5,donkershnut,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:21:33 2015 UTC,It's a turnaround ... For just one guy. And most of the uplifting response was from out-of-town.
UpliftingNews,3ck1h5,kittycuddler,2,Wed Jul 8 18:51:43 2015 UTC,"Had this discussion a bit in the original thread about him, but I think it has a lot to do with just people not having to deal with homeless beggars on a normal basis.  There's no way to know if the person is actually homeless, if they're just a druggy, or what's going to happen with the money. They could go buy a gun and kill someone for all you know if you gave them a lot. It's the uncertainty of what's happening with the person, combined with the constant bombardment of so many people that just numbs people to the fact that some of the people really are struggling and desperate through no real fault of their own (economy sucks and you're unlucky? That blows, but possibly nothing they could have done to stop it).  I only deal with beggars when I'm doing events in other cities (focused around convention centers, so lots of begging) and there's no possible way to deal with them. They're rude, shitty people who harass the fuck out of you, so it's really easy to not give a fuck about them. The one guy I've ever seen that was clearly homeless and in need of help but wasn't berating people, and instead just sitting quietly I at least gave food to because I appreciated him not being an asshole about it. (I actually don't carry cash ever, so I didn't really have anything else I could have given him, but if I had any cash I would have given him some of that too, because he was the rare person who wasn't being a total asshole about it.)  Point being, at least in my experience, which may be tainted by the fact that the assholes just tend to focus around convention centers to try to harass people unfamiliar with begging into giving them money to leave, is that it's really easy to not give a shit about a section of the population that in most all interactions have been pieces of shit to you.  I don't judge people for being homeless, because like I said, I could fucking be next month for all I know, but if you're being an asshole to me, you aren't getting shit from me.  The people who don't deal with begging (people not from where this guy is who gave all the assistance apparently) will be more likely to want to help because they don't have the experience of being constantly harassed."

It can be corrected by making the minus sign a plus sign, or flipping the ratio.   As to how the museum is also right, Wikipedia says   Usually, the lowercase form (φ) is used. Sometimes, the uppercase form (\Phi) is used for the reciprocal of the golden ratio, 1/φ.[10]   The image of the exhibit ( http://p.o0bc.com/rf/image_700w/Boston/2011-2020/2015/07/08/Boston.com/BCOM/Images/image1(10)A.jpg ) definitely shows the uppercase."

UpliftingNews,3cdwtu,TheRealMrWillis,123,Tue Jul 7 06:27:13 2015 UTC,"Real life redditor status was a euphoric time for me. I noticed reddit verbally attacking a poor damsel in distress and felt M'lady desperately needed me, her white knight, to rescue her from the trolls of Le reddit. However, M'lady felt as if I was a nice guy, but we were best off as friends. Obviously she's just a disoriented bitch who likes assholes and will never know what it's like to date a nice guy like M'self. My relationships have been meh, however, the fine gentle sirs over at /r/pcmasterrace are a classy bunch of lads and the finest group of individuals on reddit."

UpliftingNews,3cdwtu,bytester,104,Tue Jul 7 05:43:47 2015 UTC,Thank you for posting this. Camden's father talked generally about not knowing the people on Reddit or knowing who was posting and talking about it. Sounds like he was a little confused about the process. To his credit he did say his wife Traci was handling if all
UpliftingNews,3cdwtu,uokaybruh,46,Tue Jul 7 05:52:36 2015 UTC,What motivated people to attend?
UpliftingNews,3cdwtu,Shivadxb,278,Tue Jul 7 06:08:37 2015 UTC,I talked to one redditor who attended and he drove about four hours one way to be there. He said he attended because he wanted Camden to know that just because he has a speech delay doesn't mean he shouldn't have friends.
UpliftingNews,3cdwtu,DJHazzle91,122,Tue Jul 7 06:24:07 2015 UTC,That for some reason got me all emotional.
UpliftingNews,3cdwtu,opus3535,70,Tue Jul 7 07:24:33 2015 UTC,Me too. Four hours is a long drive.
UpliftingNews,3cdwtu,Numel1,43,Tue Jul 7 07:51:03 2015 UTC,Some people are really into speech problems.....

UpliftingNews,3cdwtu,mtheory007,51,Tue Jul 7 07:08:27 2015 UTC,Were there a lot of attendees around Camden's age that showed up?
UpliftingNews,3cdwtu,mtheory007,209,Tue Jul 7 06:05:08 2015 UTC,"Yes a whole ton of kids and their parents. One family came all the way from northern Virginia because their son has the same speech disorder Camden does. It was incredible.  but there were also randoms, including a big bike group, 20 somethings without kids like the one I interviewed, and regular adults without kids who just wanted to be there for him."
UpliftingNews,3cdwtu,halfscientisthalfdog,28,Tue Jul 7 06:10:23 2015 UTC,That's great to hear! I'm sure it meant a lot to him to see that many people. I know his parents must be overwhelmed
UpliftingNews,3cdwtu,Boredguy32,24,Tue Jul 7 06:20:05 2015 UTC,Did camden play with the kids? Any more on him meeting another boy with apraxia?
UpliftingNews,3cdwtu,Salacondor,20,Tue Jul 7 09:50:33 2015 UTC,Yes he was playing with all sorts of kids and I believe bad a great time. Not sure if he got to play specifically with the other little boy with apraxia I knew of

UpliftingNews,3cdwtu,Technicolor-Cakes,17,Tue Jul 7 06:51:09 2015 UTC,You know I liked that Camden wasn't forced to give a TV interview. It probably would have been exactly what makes him feel like crap so that was a +1 for journalism.
UpliftingNews,3cdwtu,dogsandpeaceohmy,16,Tue Jul 7 11:54:36 2015 UTC,The video showed a startling lack of water balloons. Was this an issue because of how many people showed up?
UpliftingNews,3cdwtu,Technicolor-Cakes,18,Tue Jul 7 05:18:40 2015 UTC,"Shayne said there were thousands, probably just weren't shown in the video."

UpliftingNews,3cdwtu,crazyfox_89,17,Tue Jul 7 08:30:24 2015 UTC,My mom did it so that I'd be unique. Why did yours do it??
UpliftingNews,3cdwtu,Technicolor-Cakes,12,Tue Jul 7 08:32:42 2015 UTC,Pretty much the exact same reason I think. I'm not sure where she got the spelling from though. Do you know where she got the spelling for you? It's been a bit of a mystery for me most of my life.
UpliftingNews,3cdwtu,nigel_uno,2,Tue Jul 7 09:47:27 2015 UTC,Shane came from the pronunciation of the Irish name Séan by those living in Northern Ireland because they've got a strange accent up there! Shayne the spelling is further 'Englishing up' of the name. Well done to Shayne #1 and of course all the good redditors who made this happen. I´m glad this boy enjoyed his birthday.

Scary!!!  Thank you for putting so much time and love into his birthday. For some reason your gift made me tear up the most.
UpliftingNews,3cdwtu,Nerdican,78,Tue Jul 7 12:59:44 2015 UTC,"It survived the trip structurally, but the minions all fell off by the time we got there! I was able to pull some magic from my sleeves and basically redecorated the back of the cake, and then covered the back with extra chocolate balloons I'd brought. It wasn't quite as good as when we left, but he looked super happy with it when the guys carried it in (didn't want to risk weighing it, but it was at least 70 lbs I'm sure.)  My son also has a speech disorder, he is delayed rather than having a full apraxia like Camden. But I just felt for him, the mom's Facebook page said that his one and only friend had recently decided he didn't want to play with him anymore and it just broke my heart. A labor of love for sure, and I'd do it all again in a heartbeat :)"

UpliftingNews,3cdwtu,notlikethat1,476,Tue Jul 7 12:38:59 2015 UTC,"Ya know what's actually really uplifting about this? Someone posts a ""hate on this person"" or ""kill this person"" and they get next to no support. Someone posts a ""help this little guy for xyz reason"" and tons of people respond. Maybe the world really is a good place and good people really are in the majority."
UpliftingNews,3cdwtu,leetdood_shadowban,159,Tue Jul 7 04:35:08 2015 UTC,"You know, I'm leaning more in this direction myself and I have a terrible outlook on society as a whole. I think you're right, no I know you're right there are more good people in the world, the dicks just get more attention."
UpliftingNews,3cdwtu,leetdood_shadowban,26,Tue Jul 7 05:45:54 2015 UTC,"I am speaking from the other end. Honestly I child care less about this person because he is a stranger, but even after saying that I would absolutely go to his party and shower them with presents if he was within a 45 min drive from where I was."
UpliftingNews,3cdwtu,my__name__is,3,Tue Jul 7 06:02:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah this is an extremely interesting topic. I don't know too much about philosophy, but from what I recall there are two guys from the Enlightenment.   Hobbes - people are naturally selfish and manipulative Rousseau - people are born with entirely good intentions, the world forms them and necessitates these 'evil' actions, written in response to Hobbes.   But since these are from the 1600 or 1700s, science has evolved just a little bit since these ideas spread. And nature v. nurture. I would think genes that will result in disease do exist, but both genes and environment seem like they would be influenced actual behavior.  So today we have a better understanding of how each person is born with a particular genome, and certain genes affect health, intelligence, addiction, personality. But there's so much more to learn.  And so finally to come to the point of this comment on this article, it definitely is awesome to read something where a child without friends (because of a speech disorder) can have the most awesome water balloon party through the kindness of strangers. Whether it's the community of the town(who appear to be most of the attendees, or that guy who drove 4 hours because he also had a speech problem, just to tell the b-day kid that everything will be okay. This is monumental, this one day will be remembered forever by the kid.  So I think people will tend to help, even if it's slightly inconvenient. But there are different criteria for every person. In this we have: a kid, check, speech disorder, check, no friends because children are horrible, check, awesome water balloon fight to show support for this kid, absofuckinlutely check.  But then the example of Ellen Pao where everyone jumps to take a jab at her. The kid was an unknown victim of society's problem with educating people on disabilities, and the physical disability itself. Ellen Pao is.. well that's a little too complicated. Let's just say, responsible for Reddit, multiple sketchy gender discrimination suits, plus she's married to a hedge fund Ponzi guy. And she eliminated all raise negotiations for Reddit employees because men have an unfair advantage. It's 's not hard to see why Reddit's rage was directed at her.  We seem more inclined to giving when there is someone who is a victim of circumstance we can help. Even if not a part of the community in VA, everyone feels a communal connection to humanity. And we seem to hate when there is a clear figurehead and the system crumbles.   It gets progressively more complicated, but I have decided for now that people are good for the most part. We need other people because we don't want to be alone, and we will usually give whatever it takes to feel like we belong. Other people can then take advantage of goodwill and that's where evil and cynicism comes in. Jesus this is long, sorry about that, get carried away sometimes by things that strike a chord. I definitely was a cynic but it felt too defeatist, now I try to stay informed for my own sake. Even if it won't help others, it feels better to try to understand, and to reevaluate and question rather than just give up on fellow mankind.  TLDR: People can be bad or good, but are usually both. People are naturally inclined to be good because it's human nature to be accepted by others, and the bad stuff happens when others take advantage of that. This story should make everyone proud."

From what you saw do you think he was able to make friends or potential playmates for future water balloon sessions? At least did the parents connect with other parents for potential friends? Just wondering if this will be a one time event for him.
UpliftingNews,3cdwtu,probably-maybe,36,Tue Jul 7 05:21:07 2015 UTC,"You know I'm not quite sure and I didn't ask that question. Camden's dad and some other family members talked to lots of people. I heard some kids say really nice things about Camden too. I can't say for sure if he made any new permanent friends, but one can hope and infer based on who showed up. Most of the kids were local in the area.  Some of the other news outlets quoted kids about being friends but I wasn't able to talk to those kids as well. I just know that the young boy had a great party."

UpliftingNews,3cdwtu,Davidkpa,62,Tue Jul 7 05:45:49 2015 UTC,"As the brother of a special needs sister, I'm with you. I'm thankful that my sister is very well accepted by people she goes to school with, but there are those tough days that happen.  Side note: I always like to be as accurate with my stories as possible. So I asked the Eubank's if special needs is a term I could use, since that's the one we use around my house for my sister. They said no because they don't see him as special needs, they see him as Camden. They preferred ""speech delay"" which is what I went with."
UpliftingNews,3cdwtu,PraiseTheGun,9,Tue Jul 7 06:18:20 2015 UTC,"I'm curious, do you know why exactly his speech delay led them to home-school him?"
UpliftingNews,3cdwtu,Chaquita_Banana,36,Tue Jul 7 07:16:10 2015 UTC,Camden's dad said they chose to home school him so that he wouldn't be labeled by the school system and so that other kids wouldn't make fun of him.  I didn't pry too much into that part of his life as it was not essential to the story at hand. I only really got to briefly talk to Camden. There were other reporters there and lots of cameras so he kinda stayed away from us. Camden's mom also didn't want him talking on camera.

UpliftingNews,3cdwtu,LynnTheCat,10,Tue Jul 7 06:03:25 2015 UTC,"Before I moved here I had driven up and down 95, through Roanoke Rapids NC many times. Never been to Southwest Virginia.  Think Roanoke and say oh great I can be right near the coast. Look on a map and see Roanoke is basically west Virginia.   fwiw Roanoke is a beautiful city with very nice people. Virginia Tech is just about 30 mins away.  Bonus points: Roanoke Rapids NC is named after the Roanoke river which originates near Roanoke in the app mountains. The Roanoke river runs down through va and NC to the Atlantic ocean, including the town named after it Roanoke Rapids.  Even more bonus points: Roanoke's original name was big lick. Then the railroad came to town and it became big luck junction. Someone decided that name wasn't appealing so it got changed to Roanoke, a word I believe means wealth.  Roanoke has major railroad history as a headquarters and major train building shop of the Norfolk and western, now Norfolk and southern railroad."

UpliftingNews,3cdwtu,CruDiablo,16,Tue Jul 7 06:51:37 2015 UTC,We're currently discussing this in another comment on this thread. I feel there is a distinction between Reddit hug and Reddit hug of death. Hug of death support and kills. Hug just shows a mass outpouring of support.   In this case to people who don't really know what Reddit is and are just starting to understand why people in china are sending their kid gifts.

So now he's living with me till he shoves off.   I give him Tumric pills every few days. He goes for walks. Eats lots of meat and chicken and is spoiled. Plus my roommate has a dog so he plays a lot and sleeps on a futon I laid flat out for him in the living room. It's not the best life any dog has ever had but compared to where he was (left alone all day, barely got walked or paid attention to, and ready to be thrown away for messing in the house because no one walked him). It's a pretty sweet gig to run around in a big back yard, go swimming in a lake, get treats nearly everyday and layout on a big comfy futon till it's his time to go.   I like what this gal is doing, I only wish we could create a foundation that got these dogs into homes."

Now he gets 1 pill a day and plays like a kitten when we get home once his kidneys dump the excess fluid by afternoon from his 20 mg morning pill (Furosemide from Target Pharmacy(easily the best price on pet meds)).  Before he was stuck being woken up all day from a full bladder and could never sleep through the night.  Drowning in his own fluids in 2008 at barely 4 years old due to the known inbreeding defects of orange cats.  Now he is a battle cat that rules the perimeter of our home and waits like a dog for us to play and come outside with him.    Family said put him down, he is defective.  We found a way to give him a long life and more time in the sun with green grass under his feet.  Achilles, our battle cat.  Long live the Fallout Kitty!  If he hears the word fallout, he expects to nap under my right arm while I play on the home theater with the PS3.  The new Fallout is going to be a problem for him, since I am finally going PC.

I just think it's the same case as when people started worshipping soldiers after they were treated so poorly during the Vietnam War. Disabled people have been shit on since time began, so now we're making up for that by treating them as normal people (making them models), when everyone knows they're not.  If anything it should be seen as an insult towards disabled people to be treated like they're not different. They have horrible looks and genetics, but they're lied to about it. If I was disabled but had a mind that functioned relatively well, I wouldn't exactly be thrilled about people calling me beautiful and perfect."

I felt like I was just getting the hang of dealing with it (bag blowouts, compromised skin around the stoma, etc.), when he said he could do the reversal.

The double strength has 900 billion bacteria per packet. Like I said, it's made specifically for people with colitis and j pouches.

Then after a year I wasn't responding to medication anymore, to the point where I was taking 30 pills of balsalazide a day, and still having to run to the bathroom dozens of times a day, often not being able to hold it.  I became super dehydrated, my hair turned to straw, I was malnourished, extremely fatigued, and I also hated eating because I knew I would be up all night sitting on the toilet.   The j pouch, while not perfect, gave me my life back. Life is pretty much back to normal.  Best decision I ever made in fact. But I'm not going to lie, the first surgery was rough on me. I still don't regret it though. My surgeon said it was my only real option. He took a picture of my colon with my phone and said no amount of medication would've helped.

I've noticed the people that really like this idea tend to be well on the road to recovery or recovered completely. I'm recovered from my self harm and I like this now more than I ever did when I still was self harming. I can see how having this symbol on your body to constantly remind you of your ""problem"" would cause strife and only make you more stressed about it.  For me, currently, I'd love to get a tattoo of this to remind me how far I've come in regards to recovery, and to remind me to never go back to that because I'm happier now than I was when I was still self harming.   I also think people on this thread fail to remember tattoos can be for yourself and act as symbols to just yourself, instead of being ""cool"" to others.

Just look at the tattoo and appreciate it for what it is, some ink in a person's skin. Don't concern yourself with what it could mean, don't ask people about it's meaning right away, because tattoos often have personal symbolism. If you find out it's because they're suicidal you'll most likely treat them different. If you're in the place to ask them and they don't get upset, or uncomfortable, they most likely don't want you to treat them different, which you probably will if you find out they have depression, suicidal tendencies etc.   Yes, you can see the tattoos, but so can they. They got the tattoo so they can look at it themselves. You just so happen to be able to see it too."

Mental illness is still stigmatized and there's this constant thought of ""is this legitimate illness or am I just whining?"" that makes it difficult for people to talk about it or sometimes even seriously think about it. I think mental health services are improving, but we need a cultural shift to make it less scary to seek them out and discuss issues with friends and family."
UpliftingNews,3cba7h,Fjdijtsk,53,Mon Jul 6 18:42:27 2015 UTC,"Having worked with a lot of non-profits, specifically mental health and some rare diseases, awareness is deeply important to their cause. Social stigmas around diseases can be huge damaging to the state of mind for patients. Mental Health is especially susceptible to this, as anyone seen depressed, having a panic attack, struggling with their identity, fighting their own emotions, or slowly watching their own mind rot away is shunned by society, often labeled as crazy, which leads to fear of them altogether. That means when someone most needs a hug instead they get left behind. Raising awareness is a way to make sure less people fall through the cracks, and to help remove the stigma that costs people jobs and loved ones."

Faith certainly may make the person who's lost a loved one feel better, as it seems to have done for the founder of this organization, but someone suffering from depression and suicidal thoughts needs to get help from a psychologist, and I'd rather support organizations expanding access in that regard.  There are going to be root issues that need to be dealt with, including potential chemical imbalances in the brain, that in all likelihood will benefit most from medical treatment.
