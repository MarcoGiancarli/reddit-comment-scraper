Acostumbrate a que tendras meses donde vestiras como en PR y tendras otros meses en que no. En invierno tengo muy pocas acitividades al aire libre, so aunque es brutal estoy expuesto por poco tiempo.   Tendras nuevos pantalones favoritos, nuevas tennis favoritas, bufanda y guantes handy. Llegara un momento que 40* no se sentiran tan mal y dias en que 65* se sienten como verano (despues de mas de un mes en los 15*). De corazon todo eso es manejable, unos dias mas layers otros dias menos (a la larga termine en tennis, jeans, commando, buena camisa, buen jacket y buena bufanda. You get use to it and it becomes normal eventually).  Ahora si, para lo que no estaba listo era para tener poca luz ultra violeta. Si un dia me acostaba a las 5am, el sol sale a las 6am... Me levanto a las 3pm y el sol se esconde a las 5pm... Dos o tres dias de esto me destrozaban el mood. No imaginas cuanto esto me jodio. Y aunque no me guste aprendi que tengo que cojer sol para mi mood, solo un par de minutos.  Ps; no tengo el frio totalmente superado pero no me es un issue, mas me importa asegurarme que tome algo de sol en el dia. Mi temperatura mas baja aqui es -29* pero debajo de 15* todo es lo mismo. Pregunta si tienes mas dudas."

We are not special, the caribbean is one of the poorest regions in the world and the same economic reality that hit most nations around us is going to be our fate. Independence doesn't come with better citizens, better politicians or big foreign corporations willing to invest or create good jobs in Puerto Rico. If we become independent one of the fist things we will have to do is lower the salaries of the average Boricuas so we can be able to compete with other countries in this region who pay slavery salaries in order to export more goods (this is actually one of the recommendations in the Kruger report). It's basic economics and geo politics, Independence will ruin Puerto Rico, Statehood is our best choice to developed a prosper economy."

So since I'm here now (came back in 2012) I will tell you, the cost of living is way lower on SOME aspects not on everything, the same luxurious apartment I was getting in downtown San Diego and paying $1275 I can get it here for $800 and in front of the beach. Utilities are at least double what they were in San Diego for me, and food is on par I guess. Cars are usually cheap too, and you can get a good one with a monthly payment of less than $400.   The trick is the pay, it's a bit difficult to get a job that pays more than $15 an hour (at least for me with a bachelors, bilingual, veteran). Public transportation is basically non-existent in Luquillo, and kinda okay in the metro area, but it will get even worse in August 1st due to schedule and route changes.  All in all, it's not a bad place, I saved some money here due to things being cheap, but I'm going back to California at the end of the year, there are more opportunities in the states."

PuertoRico,3dynzb,theavatare,8,Mon Jul 20 17:33:06 2015 UTC,Honestly the cleanliness and order thing is the one that most concerns me.  I grew up in Puerto Rico and lived in seattle for a long time and in Portland for a bit. Culturally is very different.  The other thing is that unless you got a significantly sizable bank you should expect to be affected negatively by the changes coming up in the next few years related to the economical problems.  A few things that you should expect to be different food variety in portland is amazing Puerto Rico has a growing foodie scene but is mostly in San Juan and aguadilla.  Vegetables are not really fresh in the island with the exceptions of roots that you can find a wider variety.  Musical shows in portand there is a bigger variety of styles and genders.  With that said pluses of the island include good weather all year round. And a really nice boat life if you can afford it good surf and some pretty good outdoor life in general. Also there is a lot of good alcohol.  You will pretty much need to place your daughter in private school when she reaches age.  In terms of fitness coaching crossfit is has big in the island has in the states and zumba is also pretty trending.
PuertoRico,3dynzb,theavatare,4,Mon Jul 20 17:46:34 2015 UTC,"I'm with  you there...When we travel to Brazil to see my husband's family I get so irritated with how loud and rude and crazy everyone is. Pretty much the opposite of the 'no, you go first' mentality in Portland."
PuertoRico,3dynzb,romeoprico,4,Mon Jul 20 17:57:53 2015 UTC,Also something that i'm not sure you care. But the whole drug stuff is kinda violent in the island in comparison. Like getting weed in portland is just crossing to wash or get a medical card here is a lot shadier.

PuertoRico,3dynzb,are_you_trolling,4,Tue Jul 21 21:14:38 2015 UTC,"For me the biggest concern would be for where you want your daughter (and any future children) to grow up. Which culture would you rather have influencing your child? There's a lot of good things about PR culture, like the friendliness and relaxedness of most people. But there are issues with sexism, drugs and violence that are I think worse in PR than in Portland.  Besides that, at the moment the future of PR itself is a bit worrying in terms of the economy. I'm not sure if now is the best time to be thinking of going over there.  However if you just want to try it out for a few years, I'd say now is a perfectly fine time to do it - you could move with your daughter back before she even starts school if it turns out you don't like it. On the other hand, it can't be easy moving around with a baby either!"
PuertoRico,3dynzb,SFbud,2,Mon Jul 20 22:05:27 2015 UTC,"This is one of my biggest concerns. It's those same reasons I don't want her going to school in Brazil either. I thought American culture over sexualized women, but damn, it seems so so bad in Latin culture."
PuertoRico,3dynzb,marshmallowclouds,2,Tue Jul 21 01:00:14 2015 UTC,"My experience with people in Puerto Rico is that generally the women are pretty self-driven and most of them are quite feminist. The men, on the other hand... I regularly heard comments from men that I would consider sexist. My PR boyfriend tells me stories that men have told him that are much worse. Not that that never happens in the US of course, but I think it might be more pervasive over there.  I didn't grow up in PR though, I only lived there for a year and a bit so take my opinion with a grain of salt."

I think the weather is another big thing, there's not really seasons in Puerto Rico it's either rainy and hot or dry and hot. So if you have no problems being out in the sun you should be fine    While living there I was never directly affected by crime, and I live in Santurce (not very safe). Crime is out there but you must also remember that news outlets don't get viewers with uplifting news. I live in SF and the local news here are not all that different to PR crime wise    As far as not speaking the language, I would not worry. It seems to me the island is very accommodating to non Spanish speakers.   Hope this helps."

I usually proceed with an explanation of the economical disadvantages of our current status, a general overview of our debt and the pros/cons of statehood vs. independence.

PuertoRico,3e1ogz,marshmallowclouds,1 point,Wed Jul 22 08:26:47 2015 UTC,"From the US point of view: It would never pass congress. States were brought it in two by two, balancing a Republican and a Democrat state at all times to maintain status quo in the Senate. All those, including PR, lean towards being Democrat, not Republican. Congress would never allow it.  From the PR point of view: Every referendum someone says that, but there has never been a strong enough majority to raise any eye brows in the US. It is hard to justify to the US then that Puerto Rican's really want this when ""status quo"" or ""no changes"" options beat it by a couple of percents. In other words, Puerto Ricans are too divided about this issue to speak with a strong voice towards any status formula."

You start off and work your way up, or you go out and make your own business, or work multiple jobs.

I love my people but it saddens me to see the new generation rely on a payout from the government then spend it on shit they don't need. Last time I checked business were thriving down there, not sure where people are pulling out this money from but government assistance must be really good.

The Caribbean is one of the poorest regions in the world. It's not just about good government, it's economics you need to have comparative advantage and we can't go back to cheap labor like, Cuba, RD, Jamaica and most of the other Islands."
PuertoRico,3d0cyt,aykau777,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:47:09 2015 UTC,"Alright look... I don't think PR is gonna be some miracle case of hope, and economic growth in comparison to the rest of the Caribbean, but I also don't think your shitting on the DR is fair. They've come a long way. Also Cuba is a special case of dictatorship, and economic suppression. I think it's safe to safe PR isn't doing much better currently. Certainly not against the DR.   DR GDP growth as been on par with PR since 2004, and since then 7 of those years have been better than PR. link  DR GDP growth link  Unemployment rate in the DR has also been better overall since 2010. And at the rate PR is currently going it's about to get much worse especially without out any sign of an American bailout in the pipeline.   DR 2010-2015 link  PR 2010-2015 link  My mother's family is from the PR, and her uncles migrated to the DR in the 1920's because even then they found better economic opportunity. So it all goes in cycles, and PR definitely has not been an economic paradise since the USA took it over as a territory in 1898.  The US does indeed take a lot from the PR, and most of all in my opinion is the sense of independence the country needs in order to govern itself. Now, personally yes it would be difficult for the PR to adjust, but in all my life working abroad, and countries smaller than the PR I find it kind of curious that Puerto Ricans don't really seem interested in governing themselves, but hey that's fine, I don't live there and I can't really judge them for that.   I also think it's an extra shame, because I really don't think the US congress would ever vote for PR to be the 51st state... I'd have to see it with my own eyes to believe it.   So to me PR is the first instance I've ever seen where a group of people don't want to govern themselves. But again I'm not gonna pass any serious judgement about it, because it's not me living there, so whatever the people vote -fine. I also understand that PR has never had a history of independence. Maybe when the USA is in another depression the Puerto Ricans' won't see any benefits to be attached to the Americans, and go it alone.   Now that not withstanding I think PR is capable of managing its own economy without destroying its forest. Trade, education, innovation, and ingenuity go a long way. I lived for a few years in South Korea which has very little in natural resources other than its people, but maybe Puerto Ricans don't have the same drive.   Again I'm not passing harsh judgment of PR for wanting to stay a territory, but to me it does seem they are putting off the inevitable, and it's a shame they don't want to take control of their own destiny."

PuertoRico,3d0cyt,Stillstring,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:43:03 2015 UTC,"Again this is basic economics, both the DR and Cuba have as a comparative advantage cheap labor. Of course their economy is going to grow, many investors are going to be interested in the DR or Cuba, but this only means that big corporations like Melia or Hilton will make a ton of money while the average cuban or dominican only gets a shitty job . This is a terrible way to grow an economy is not a solution, you can't build a prosper country if your economy depends on $10 a day jobs. Cuba and the DR are always going to be poor countries. If we become independent in order for us to be able to compete we will have to go back againt to cheap labor. This means having a big chunck of our population on poverty. This is basic economics a sense o patriotism or independence is not magic. I think you lack a basic understanding of economics and thats why I think you are naive or maybe just ignorant. I get your points about how the DR is growing, but you are going no where if that growth depends on cheap labor. Puerto Rico is way past that, in a sense we are a develope country our situation is different.  It's irrelevant if they don't want to gives us statehood. Why? cause our cause is a civil rights movement. Statehood means equality for Puerto Ricans we are US citizens and Puerto Rico is part of the US . We also are already a political force in florida. We are not like other Hispanic groups that you can ignore because the majority can't vote. All of us vote as soon as we set foot in the continental US. This means we are key voters to Florida. Which means not solving our status has political consequences. We are not latinos, we are american citizens, hispanics, but still americans."

Puerto Rico is way past that, in a sense we are a develope country our situation is different.   Yeah so it should be much easier for PR to have a higher standard of living than DR or Cuba. The infrastructure and education is there. It should do much better, and once you have a higher education of citizens you develop a more dynamic economy. There are a lot of variables to an economy other than cheap labour... I'm flabbergasted you see it that way, but economics aside lets get to your second point.   It's irrelevant if they don't want to gives us statehood. Why? cause our cause is a civil rights movement. Statehood means equality for Puerto Ricans we are US citizens and Puerto Rico is part of the US.    That's kinda thin. I can see why you want it that way, but try winning that over with the average American. Hell I had one the other day ask me who was the ambassador from Puerto Rico, and I just laughed.   We are not like other Hispanic groups that you can ignore because the majority can't vote. All of us vote as soon as we set foot in the continental US.    You know you have to live here first before voting right? You can't just fly over for election day vote, and head back to PR. You have to have an establish residency. Puerto Ricans aren't that big of a voting bloc, certainly not across the country. The biggest is in Florida with 4.5% of the vote. Maybe you'll have a few representatives here or there, but that is a loooooong way off.   Look I see it as a two way thing. PR wants statehood, and fine, but you have to take the case to the American people so their representatives in congress will vote for it. That's a hard processes, so good luck.

In no part of my comment did I condone this, I was simply offering a very real fact that to grow more local food means to replace natural ecosystems.  If I were to incorporate global thinking into my perspective, as you suggest, I would condone industrial agriculture backed by banks too big to fail, politicians in their pockets, and a depletion of natural resources fed by consumerism and globalization (See NAFTA). Besides, Puerto Rico cannot simply do as every other nation in the world, for the simple reason that it is an island, which introduces a number of difficulties regarding trade, helped none at all by the Jones act, as you mentioned yourself.  Instead, how about the incorporation of silviculture, organic farms, and the implementation of a balanced agricultural/ecological system?

It was the fourth referendum on status to be held in Puerto Rico and the first in which a majority voted for statehood. Puerto Rico has been an unincorporated territory of the United States since the Spanish뉴merican War in 1898.  Puerto Rican voters were asked two questions: (1) whether they agreed to continue with Puerto Rico's territorial status and (2) to indicate the political status they preferred from three possibilities: statehood, independence, or a sovereign nation in free association with the United States.  970,910 (54.00%) voted ""No"" on the first question, expressing themselves against maintaining the current political status, and 828,077 (46.00%) voted ""Yes"", to maintain the current political status. Of those who answered on the second question 834,191 (61.11%) chose statehood, 454,768 (33.34%) chose free association, and 74,895 (5.55%) chose independence.    The governor-elect Alejandro Garc칤a Padilla of the Popular Democratic Party (PPD) and several other leaders who favor the present status had recommended voting ""Yes"" to the first question, and leaving the second question blank as a protest to what they said was ""an anti-democratic process"" and ""a trap"".

Between Trujillo and Balaguer, Dominicans (especially older Dominicans) have developed a truly unique set of mental gymnastics to justify hating Haitians for the simple crime of being poor.  That being said, Dominican civil society along with the government have pushed hard in the last few years to improve their condition, and this amnesty plan will allow these people to finally have legal status in the country.  The hope is that this will begin to put an end to a lot of the abuses the Haitians have had to endure due to their illegal status.  The process has not been perfect, but it's about as good and fair as you could expect from a small independent country like the Dominican Republic, which has had to work hard to find its way in the world and has not had everything handed to them for the last 100 years."

Yo conozco muy bien su historia, su gente y el pais. Yo no creo que realmente se quiera ayudar a los Haitianos. Fundamentalmente por la xenofobia que existe contra ellos. Ustedes niegan a ellos lo que le suplican a los Espa침oles y a los Americanos."

El efecto sicol칩gico al brincar el charco es pr치cticamente todo lo contrario a la idea gen칠rica de la ""actitud del colonizado"".    Attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors that reflect ethnic self-hatred and futile desires to emulate the dominant group at the expense of their heritage culture and ethnicity have been documented among Puerto Ricans (Varas-Diaz & Serrano-Garcia, 2003), Mexicans (Codina & Montalvo, 1994; Hall, 1994), Native Americans (Brave Heart, 1998; Duran, 2006; Duran & Duran, 1995; McBride, 2002), southern Africans (Richards, Pillay, Mazodze, & Govere, 2005), and other historically colonized groups   Source"
PuertoRico,3caycx,adolfojp,9,Mon Jul 6 15:57:03 2015 UTC,"En mi opini칩n la actitud del colonizado no consiste en copiar la cultura del ""opresor"" sino en definir su identidad en base a la relaci칩n que tiene con el ""opresor"".  Tomemos a USA como ejemplo. Es un pa칤s que tiene 0 complejos de colonizado y por ende los estadounidenses no tienen problemas en asimilar diferentes elementos culturales de diferentes lugares. La pizza y los tacos y los hot dogs y el rock and roll son tan Americanos como el apple pie y el meat loaf. Los estadounidenses al no sentirse colonizados se sienten libres a crecer como quieren.  Sin embargo, si yo hago lo mismo y digo que me gustan los hamburgers y que mi agrupaci칩n favorita es una banda de rock Puertorrique침a de los 90 corro el riesgo de que me digan que me estoy asimilando y por ende traicionando mi cultura. Esa actitud me imposibilita crecer como persona ya que aprender de otras culturas es aparentemente traicionar la m칤a. Los que critican a los Puertorrique침os por americanizarse les quitan la libertad de expresarse como quieran.   Por ende, para m칤 el sentirse colonizado consiste en querer preservar un estereotipo para siempre, independientemente de cuan certero sea, por temor de desaparecer ante el ""opresor"". Hay mucha gente a la que le encantar칤a ver a los Puertorrique침os comiendo arroz y habichuelas en el 3015 mientras el resto del mundo come pescado de las lunas de J칰piter marinado en acerolas de Marte y cuando eso ocurra la gente nos va a mirar a nosotros como nosotros ahora miramos a los Nativo Americanos de las reservaciones de los Estados Unidos. Son gente que se enfoc칩 tanto en defenderse de la influencia del ""opresor"" que olvid칩 que una cultura es algo vivo y no una pieza de museo.  Pero esa actitud de sentirse colonizado no viene solo desde adentro como una reacci칩n a los de afuera. Cada vez que un turista te acusa de falta de autenticidad cuando le dices que te gusta la comida Tailandesa te est치 definiendo desde afuera y forz치ndote a aceptar el estereotipo. Te est치 mirando no desde la perspectiva de un igual pero desde la perspectiva de un colonizador. Y esa gente, en mi opini칩n, se puede ir para el carajo."

PuertoRico,3caycx,goro413,-1,Mon Jul 6 20:33:19 2015 UTC,"Se me hace dif칤cil seguir tu ejemplo al considerar que los Estados Unidos pr치cticamente nacieron en base a su diversidad cultural. Realmente no adoptaron elementos ""de afuera"" porque la mayor칤a de ellos fueron creados en el mismo pa칤s. Por ejemplo, la pizza m치s asquerosa que me he comido en mi vida fue en Italia.  Independientemente del ejemplo, lo que hay que mirar es la combinaci칩n entre la preferencia por algo extranjero y un desprecio hac칤a lo local. Si la tendencia es de mezclar esas dos ideas pues entonces s칤 estamos hablando de esa actitud. Un ejemplo tonto es un cuento que me hicieron una vez de alguien que vend칤a camisetas en los festivales en Puerto Rico y no le fue bien hasta que cambi칩 el ""Hecho en Puerto Rico"" por el ""Made in U.S.A"".  En mi diccionario yo le llamo e침angotamiento cultural."
