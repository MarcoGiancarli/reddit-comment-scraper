intrusivethoughts,3e0jv9,Olfbir,2,Tue Jul 21 13:08:55 2015 UTC,If there's one thing I learned from psych it's that everyone has certain amounts of almost every disorder.  The labels are just a lense to help us understand.

Once you realise that you've fucked up and your super-effective new dick won't deflate, jam the screwdriver into the little plastic mechanism between the teeth and the strip.

intrusivethoughts,3dv0b6,TinglingTeeth,34,Sun Jul 19 19:09:22 2015 UTC,"STORY TIME.  I was a graduate teaching assistant at a 4-year university a couple of years ago. One day, everyone I knew named Elizabeth told me about an email they got from a man who said something like ""I saw you on the campus bus and you're very beautiful (creepy details about this Elizabeth's beauty) etc etc...""   Turns out, he emailed EVERY PERSON NAMED ELIZABETH IN THE CAMPUS EMAIL DIRECTORY to find this one beautiful Elizabeth he saw on the bus the previous day."
