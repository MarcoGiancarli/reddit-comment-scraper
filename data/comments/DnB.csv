DnB,3dny2f,_likethewaves_,11,Sat Jul 18 13:53:21 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna have to echo the other two commenters and say liquid is my favorite. Drum & bass is typically seen as being so hype because of the high BPMs and whatnot, but liquid is just so chill and beautiful. Also, points for liking Etherwood. Fuckin' love that guy."
DnB,3dny2f,DJWikipedia,10,Sat Jul 18 00:09:18 2015 UTC,"I'm into darker stuff from neurofunk to some of the eerier sounding techstep. I'm not sure what it is exactly that I love about it but it's all so dark and intense. I've always thought the appeal for dnb in general was the contrast between the heavy rolling/smooth bass over the sporadic, syncopated drums.  I don't really know how I got into DNB, it was actually the first type of electronic music I ever got into. I used to listen to everything from jazz to rock and metal but then found dnb and instantly fell in love. Back then I didn't even know about neuro, most of the dnb I knew was popular stuff and jump up. Once I discovered Noisia and Receptor everything changed haha.  I was a huge dnb head for a few years and I'll always love dnb but recently I've been getting super heavy into techno."
DnB,3dny2f,BADGERUK90,9,Sat Jul 18 00:08:32 2015 UTC,I love a bit of liquid...but its all about JUNGLE!!!   Can't believe there are no jungalist comments here.

DnB,3dny2f,Lizard771,6,Fri Jul 17 23:00:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what the subgenre is to be called, but I like specifically the old school type of Neurofunk(?). Typically the kind of sound from the entire Wormhole album from Ed Rush & Optical. (Best album ever!)  Ed Rush & Optical - Glass Eye  I like the repetitiveness and the industrial/grimy sounds.  Bad Company - The Nine is another prime example of this sound that I enjoy.  Ninja Edit: However, I should mention that I also very much enjoy Liquid Funk - almost exclusively songs that has female vocals in them."

DnB,3dny2f,FauxJour,7,Sat Jul 18 08:23:16 2015 UTC,"Neurofunk. I am a huge jungle and liquid fan but neurofunk is where its at.  First off the ambience. With neurofunk everything feels like a cold ship cellar, and you don't know what's going to happen but when the beat drops I feel like I am part of the cast of aliens and the acid hit.   Second off the intros. So cold and dark and filled with much ambience. Wow. Really easy to double drop when mixing and I find most mixes boring so I find it amazing to drop sweet bassy beats.  Third off it's my fiancée's favourite genre. I have shown her liquid, jungle, jump up, techstep and everything else but neurofunk gets her wet. I tried this out. I played a set of a bunch of different genres. I shit you not but when phace comes on her vagina goes into overdrive. Only phace. I am trying to figure this shit out"

DnB,3dny2f,zuk1,3,Sat Jul 18 03:36:10 2015 UTC,at first when i listened to my first drum&bass song it was a jungle type one that was in the video game of fifa. (soul beat rhuna) thats what i remember. after that i began researching and listening to the jungle types of that genre and then listened to the rest. after a couple of months in 2010 i began to like the music of drum&bass. then started to listen to the new releases of 2011 until i have favorited many artists. and finally i started to mix this type of music. favorite is LIQUID  it makes me feel comfortable listening to it on the way going to places in the streets by transportation looking at the sky clouds nature stuff

Liquid like Stunna/Bachelors of Science - Rhodes Ahead and Logistics - Kaleioscope. Got introduced to liquid while I was tuned to Bassdrive and heard these tracks get some proper airtime.

DnB,3dp666,telekinetic_turtle,3,Sat Jul 18 02:56:22 2015 UTC,techstep and neuro are pretty much the same thing.    Liquid is the softer side of dnb.    Drumfunk is all about the drums taking over.  Heavy breaks.  Think old photek or Paradox maybe.  Hope this helps you.
DnB,3dp666,natedog82,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:00:49 2015 UTC,"Tech step about drums, neuro about bass"
DnB,3dp666,voidtype,5,Sat Jul 18 06:05:31 2015 UTC,"Haha wtf, nooo. Techstep is generally really aggressive and loud, features sampled breaks and a rather monotone, but very distorted bass (prime example: Proton by Ed Rush & Nico and Trace's stuff, BC's Nitrous is cool too). Neurofunk* generally features non-sampled breaks and a rhythm that's more two-steppy. Also it relies more on a cold & dark ambience. Techstep is the precursor of Neurofunk and Neurofunk mixed Techstep's Techstepiness with the aesthetics of intelligent drum 'n' bass (Ambient DnB) (check out Ed Rush & Optical's Wormhole, Nasty Habits' Shadow Boxing and Source Direct). Liquid Funk is atmospheric, chill, not aggressive and is influenced by Jazz, R&B etc (there are TONS of mixes on YouTube for Liquid Funk). Drumfunk is pretty much like Liquid, but it features chopped up breaks (that are rearranged in a different way) and often sounds a little bit like Breakcore. Drumfunk is against the simple repetition of drum beats, which happens pretty much everywhere (check out B Key's Man Of Science). Jungle is the precursor of all DnB. It happened after Breakbeat Hardcore. It is often slower than today's DnB and pretty much only uses sampled breaks and generally a lot of sampled sounds (check out Renegade's Terrorist). Jump Up features heavy basslines (just listen to a mix, you'll get the idea).  *Talking about reaaaaal Neurofunk"

DnB,3dn6dl,GeekMusic,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:38:13 2015 UTC,"Ahh thanks, this is pretty close. Is there a name for this empty style of DnB?"
DnB,3dn6dl,GeekMusic,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:19:20 2015 UTC,"I'm not too sure if there is a specific name for the style. There are very few songs that follow that 'minimal/ white noise'. The closest kind of DnB it reminds me of its Autonomic but I wouldn't even call it that as that has more of a techy/glitchy feel to it. Artist like Bop or MicrofunkCrew (Bop is 1/3 of that group) make that.   I've heard Camo & Krooked refer to it as an 'Anti-drop', the idea being building up a lot of hype into the drop to that 'minimal/white noise' sound.   If any label is going to push that style it's going to be Hospital/Med School. Metrik and C&K are both signed to Hospital so I'd keep an eye out on them.   When songs like 'Want my Love' and 'All Night' get released it creates a bit of  a snowball effect so it wouldn't surprise me that more of this style starts getting made by other producers. I'd say by late 2015/early 2016 you'll see a bit more of this come out of the woodworks."

I mean, they were soooo moved by the response they were getting from the crowd, almost constantly the one who was not ""on duty"" was taking pictures, clapping us and all, it was really one of the greatest dnb experiences for me.

DnB,3d5kbg,submergej2,3,Mon Jul 13 18:41:03 2015 UTC,Song's like 4:02? Anything by Culture Shock. That's his signature bassline there. Just peep through his SoundCloud and I'm sure you'll find a few tracks that have that sound. Culture Shock - I Remember is one of his best tracks IMO.

As for the Flux Pavilion song I'm pretty sure it's just a bootleg that they may be using as it does sound similar to the beginning of the Prototypes remix.

DnB,3cx9lx,J_B_T,2,Sat Jul 11 16:20:49 2015 UTC,"Are you asking for the break used? As far as I can hear, there isn't a break sample and I can't really pinpoint the origin in individual hits used. That said, if you like the heavy driving synth sound, Camo & Krooked are good for that."
DnB,3cx9lx,cekryb,2,Mon Jul 13 04:00:30 2015 UTC,"Thank you for replying.     Camo & Krooked mostly produce d&b that doesnt deviate much. their other stuff is strictly big room, house or drumstep.     Some people in the youtube comments call this drumstep. I have compared drumstep beats to this one, they have similar rates. But for the life of me, i would never in my lifetime call this drumstep. It sounds too clean to be drumstep, without those annoying wubs and quick buzzes."
DnB,3cx9lx,cekryb,2,Mon Jul 13 04:20:40 2015 UTC,"No worries. I think Camo and Krooked, looking back on the tracks I dug,  I can agree that they cater to the big room sound. However, there are some tracks like All Night that feel like a departure.   Half-time is generally considered drumstep-ish these days, but still seems to fall in dnb territory. Everything around rhythm in dance music is just an easy marker for broad variations, but even some people disagree there too. I always laugh at the ever evolving subgenre names because it was stuff like wobble or clownstep(Bodyrock by Andy C and Shimon causing the nom de plume here) back in the day, but that had swing on the tempo. Yet I digress, it's just a matter of searching out tracks because even some artists themselves may classify them in a different way you'd think. Happy hunting though."

DnB,3cp7b3,SykoTavo,3,Thu Jul 9 17:39:21 2015 UTC,"It's a vicious circle. The more mainstream the genre becomes, the more mainstream people will like it and the more people will make more mainstream tracks within the genre.  Most big room tracks sound pretty much the same to me  Edit: I don't think it's the vocals that will make this happen, it's a part of experimenting and that is a great thing. The only real problem I see is DnB being popularized (and made mainstream) by artists with huge fanbases that come from a real mainstream genre turning DnB into generic poppy music (because the crowd seems to like generic)"
DnB,3cp7b3,PlayerThirty,2,Thu Jul 9 20:51:40 2015 UTC,The vocals themselves are not the problem. Many great tracks use vocals. The problem comes when the vocals drown out or overshadow other elements of the song. Elements that define it as DnB.
DnB,3cp7b3,FruitdealerF,3,Fri Jul 10 12:37:34 2015 UTC,"The genre was originally named DnB but that was during/after jungle. In the 15 years after that it has changed a lot and I think using the name of the genre as an argument for discrediting certain concepts or ideas is just lazy.  You are more then welcome to dislike Ghost, I'm listening to it now and I kind of agree that the vocals are not fitting well with the track but your whole argument about VOCALS & BASS is stupid.  In return I'll give you another vocal heavy track that I really love https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Gbop-ZLUfA  So I'd say please keep using tons of vocals producers. To each his own."

DnB,3cj2v2,Musclepirate,3,Wed Jul 8 08:29:04 2015 UTC,"You can just start by using a DAW and blending your tracks together using EQ plugins, but a lot of the fun in mixing/DJing drum & bass is actually doing it live. So a DJ controller (a piece of hardware used by DJs to control the DJing software) , CD decks or turntables are what you should be looking at.  Very basic mixing you can do with a 2 deck controller (or cdjs etc), but in drum & bass 4 deck mixing is quite common and a lot of DJs get to a point where they'll wish they got a 4 deck controller. Numark does some very cheap 4 deck controllers (though if you want quality I'd heavily consider another brand) - such as the Mixtrack Quad and the Numark N4.  The software you use depends on the controller you get, as some might come bundled with its own free software or be optimized for other DJ software.  There are enough tutorials out there on EQing and effects on DJing so it'd be pointless to explain it here - search."
DnB,3cj2v2,squelchy04,2,Wed Jul 8 13:19:43 2015 UTC,"I can't really say how long it took to learn as it was years ago when I started.   In terms of equipment you have a pretty wide choice. I'll list out some options: 1. You can go down the route of getting a controller (I've personally only used a couple briefly but they just aren't the same). It's all in one, so all you'd need is the controller, your monitors and the software (traktor/serato etc.) 2. CDJs. This is what I've got. If you have enough money to do so, get second hand Pioneers - they hold their value and they will last. If you buy cheap, you will only end up upgrading to Pioneers later on, thus costing you more money overall. 3. Vinyl turntables. This is what I strongly recommend to learn on. I learnt on turntables, it really gets you to master the basics in a very visual and tactile way. Learning on anything other than turntables, you will almost certainly pick up some bad habits. Of course, you will have to put a bit more effort into buying records, but it's fun so not really an effort. Alternatively you can get turntables with a DVS system (Traktor/Serato). Regarding your ease of manipulation question, I'm not really sure what you're getting at here. With a mixer you can EQ (most are 3-band EQs) and apply effects and filters (if the mixer has them). With CDJs/a controller you can also loop parts of a track."
DnB,3cj2v2,Vandenn,2,Wed Jul 8 17:08:59 2015 UTC,"How long did it take you to learn very basic mixing   like a week or two iirc, depends for everybody though. some people probably pick it up in a day, some probably take a few weeks.    What hardware/software will I need? (Only have a laptop and soundsystem haha)   you can get a midi controller, which will allow you to just plug it into your laptop and control playback through special software (speed and pitch adjust for beat matching, eq for mixing etc)   or you can go the cd route (more fun imo), and get 2 decks and a mixer. connect the decks to line in (not phono, it will be insanely loud - this is for vinyl) on your mixer with RCAs and connect your mixers master out to your speakers. burn your CDs and you're away.    How easy is it to manipulate tracks during a mix? (EQs, effects?)    Well that's what mixing is, really. You can't just let two tracks play alongside each other even if they're perfectly beat matched cause the bass notes will clash and sound terrible, or the drums will layer unpleasantly.   midi controllers usually come with effects units, and some cd decks do (I know the numark ndx series do). effects units are far from essential. high/low pass filters are sometimes fun, but most are really cheesy.   good luck, it's lotsa fun. half the fun is figuring out your own techniques too, so try not to just completely mimic some youtube dj.  Oh almost forgot. you can download something like virtual dj, which gave me a pretty good visual idea of what was actually going on during a mix before I'd even bought anything."
DnB,3cj2v2,g0_west,2,Wed Jul 8 21:25:08 2015 UTC,"Buy turntables, suck horribly in front of the local dj's you idolize as they throw trash at you when you train wreck for a couple months. Take the train into the city and find sketchy little vinyl stores to buy your dnb. Suck some more. Keep spinning go to shows. Keep spinning... oh yeah... everything is different now. Damn... y'all are gonna miss out on some grade A suffering."
