It is both a scholarly pursuit (it is not terribly uncommon to find people learning ancient latin or old german or old english to help read the manuscripts), and a physical one. Current living lineages in unarmed include, ringen, wrestling, and glima, which all mean ""wrestling"" but do their techniques differently, as well as BKB(puglism) and Savate (which was ported from the east).  The Living armed arts largely have converted to sport fencing but there are still classical fencers, Rapierists, Singlestick fighters, Bata Fighters, some sabreurs and broadswords...people.  The resurrected styles include several types of sword, polearm, spear, shield, and other miscellaneous weapons.   The community is open source and fairly well committed to being inclusive. There are many (very valuable) resources online to help people learn in their own time and even from a distance (although not as well, personal experience).   We do try to keep our techniques realistic and accurate (even if they are often out of context) to the historical methods which had been refined for so long, and so there is sometimes so gruff in the community toward the ahistorical SCA and LARP communities but this often is just masking a desire to spread the real art as far as we can.   We use all sorts of weapons and techniques and have to learn about many sorts of cultures and contexts in our arts, and despite this searching pursuit, it is still a present path to self-perfection, as all good arts are. It is meditation in motion, as well as homage to the past, and one of many foundations for a healthy future. The arts are usually open to all genders and sizes, and the community is generally friendly  If you'd like to learn more head over to /r/wma"

But unlike modern or classical fencing, the fight does not stop when two combatants close to grappling distance. Althought 80% of the fight is usually ends with weapon strikes, you do need to know how to handle yourself if someone decides to try the old crash and tackle. A lot of the wrestling at the sword is very similar to the stuff you see in traditional Japanese juijitsu stuff but the Europeans have a special lineage for armoured fighting at half-sword which is really cool.

BUT you should look into particular schools philosophies. Some schools focus more on spiritual development and some are very martial. I practice Iaido at an aikido school and from what I understand our aikido is a balance of the two with a bias towards the martial side. Different schools will yield a slightly different art. In the end you need to talk with several instructors at several schools and decide what it is you resonate with.

martialarts,3e4krw,kotu,2,Wed Jul 22 00:01:37 2015 UTC,"TKD generally is 85-15 punches-kicks, a clear kick emphasis. Though it is flashy and those kicks pack some real power, it's becoming more and more visible in kickboxing and MMA that these are the things that bring your game to the top level.  You could train TKD and crosstrain in something else at the same time, boxing for example - to improve your punch techniques. In TKD sparring you won't be allowed to punch the head, but the body is okay. Kicking to the head is fine though cus fuck logic!  Another martial art that has some flashy techniques is Kyokushin Karate, though I'd subtract some points from their kicking (in comparison) and add it to the punches. While they also do not punch the head, they are more well rounded in that they punch a lot to the body (instead of mostly just as a counter or when someone gets too close like in TKD).   If you want the best leg dexterity and most opportunity to pull of the flashy moves go TKD and maybe boxing to improve your punching.  If you want more well-rounded training and some really intense conditioning, you should go for Kyokushin.  I'd also like to add that the quality control in TKD, especially in the US, is generally quite a bit worse than Kyokushin. Meaning that you will be more likely to come across a bad place that may hand out black belts to kids just like that, charge ridiculously high amounts of money and put you on contracts, or have bad instruction.   The main reason for that is the ATA or ""American Taekwondo Association"", it's a TKD governing body which is known for low quality, belt farms, ridiculous prices and sparring little or not at all. It's seperate from the two main ones WTF (World Taekwondo Federation) and ITF (International Taekwondo Federation), avoid it at all costs.   WTF and ITF are both okay at quality control but it will vary from fantastic to terrible as well, with most being fine.  That said, there are good places out there. You should try what's available and judge for yourself, because people on the Internet won't be able to judge correctly for you."

martialarts,3e4d9t,doboksquawk,2,Tue Jul 21 21:28:55 2015 UTC,"One thing that's always fascinated me about things like TKD or karate which have either a very long history or direct ties to very old arts is how they look from a historical perspective in regards to their technical focus. Like how jujutsu and European ringen grew out of the need to bypass armor of various kinds. The one thing that I've always wondered with TKD is, what's the historical reasoning for the high prevalence of kicks?"
martialarts,3e4d9t,Apollo78,2,Wed Jul 22 00:33:10 2015 UTC,"That's actually a really great question. I'll have to add that one to the list for sure.  The short answer is that TKD grew out of karate (primarily Shotokan) which has its own kicks, but was also influenced by an old Korean martial art/game called taekkyon, which is entirely kick-focused. When the people who created TKD were first forming the art (having just gotten out of the Japanese occupation), they wanted to create something not only distinct from the Japanese karate but something they thought was better. They thought that creating an art with spectacular jumps and powerful kicks would show that it was athletically superior.  Then there's the fact that rules make styles. When the two styles of TKD split, they developed their own separate rule sets for sparring. The World TKD Federation (which became the more popular style and is the one you see in the Olympics) further emphasized kicking by making it illegal to punch to the head and making it difficult to score with a punch since you have to punch someone pretty damn hard to get a point."

martialarts,3e14tr,Fishbelly32,25,Tue Jul 21 03:50:00 2015 UTC,"Feel comfortable telling your training partner to ease off. Whether it is in the clinch training (where you can hurt your neck) or in sparring. Don't assume the other guy can read your mind. If you are uncomfortable, speak up.  Also, wrap your hands properly and save your money for good gear and not the cheapest crap. Avoid the stinky ones in class, they have staph infections. Find good light/medium contact technical sparring partners and do that after every class."
martialarts,3e14tr,gorchitza,5,Tue Jul 21 04:08:22 2015 UTC,"Good stuff, thanks. Haven't bought wraps or anything yet, here's to hoping they wash them from time to time. Also, the second level class meets right after ours gets out, so I may not be able to do a whole lot of sparring afterward until I move up."
martialarts,3e14tr,_rattvs_,2,Tue Jul 21 04:19:47 2015 UTC,"Also, when you do get wraps try to get 180"" Mexican wraps."
martialarts,3e14tr,vandaalen,2,Tue Jul 21 10:44:31 2015 UTC,"I personally prefere 180"" non-elastic wraps. Especially when doing intervalls on the punching bag and such. If I use shorter or eleastic ones, I will definetly feel the difference in my hand and my wrist the next day.  I'd also recommend that you get a couple of pairs right from the start. I mostly use mine just one time, sometime two times, if I didn't wear them longer than 1/2 hour or so, and wash them.  Besides from the fact that your gloves will be kept much fresher, you also risk getting infections from small wounds with dirty bandages. Think of them like you think of socks. If you've never smelled an old boxing glove, you'll instantly know what I mean, when you put on a pair of used ones at your gym.  Oh btw. Besides from always emptying your bag directly after getting home, also make sure to take your gloves out, open them and put them up with the opening to the top, so they can dry and get some ventilation. You can also stuff newspapers in them, but I am actually not really a fan of it. Just making sure they can dry properly always did the trick for me.  One final generic tip:  Take it easy. Although you are a fit guy your new sport involves many movements you are not used to and requires muscles you most likely did not train up to now.  I can tell you that literally every guy at ma MMA gym wouldn't listen to this advice b the coaches in the beginning and literally everybody paid it with a serious injury. Shredded ligaments in the knee, chronically infected tendons, broken ribs, torn muscle fiber, just name it - I have seen it all it mostly happened because of overtraining and not being able to focus and pay attention on the important things.  You are not training for the next K1 World Championships or the UFC, at least not now. So take it easy until you are. ;)  But the most important tip: Have fun! Training martial arts did so many good things to me and my life and it's one of the most awesome ways to spend your time, plus you'll find many new really good people who will become your friends."
martialarts,3e14tr,MMABouncer,-2,Tue Jul 21 21:49:12 2015 UTC,Make sure that you train full contact. Can't stress this enough.
martialarts,3e14tr,A_Flying_Muffin,18,Tue Jul 21 14:40:31 2015 UTC,"One big thing you're going to have to do is let go of your ego. You're an athlete. You are used to being good at things, things you have been doing for a long time.   Martial arts are different. They are completely new. You have to accept being humbled and finding yourself completely out of your element. Don't get frustrated. Don't think you're going to be amazing off the bat. My advice can be summarized as this, ""Be okay with being new"". It's a big hurdle I had to overcome when I started martial arts, as I came from an athletic background.   Even after 3+ years of two martial arts, I started BJJ recently and the learning process begins anew. I'm an amateur again. Martial arts are amazing, and if you stick with them, I'm sure you will love them as much as I have."
martialarts,3e14tr,ItsRobography,5,Tue Jul 21 05:55:18 2015 UTC,"I got that slice of humble pie when I did yoga for the first time. ""How hard can stretching be?"" I thought. Hard.

I've only ever been in one fight, years ago, and thinking back to how awkward and weak that punch was still makes me lol."

martialarts,3e14tr,aznednacni,3,Tue Jul 21 20:59:17 2015 UTC,I agree 100%. My goal on any given day is to suck less than I did yesterday.
martialarts,3e14tr,jewelsteel,30,Tue Jul 21 12:19:30 2015 UTC,"Okay I'm writing this from my phone so it might not be the most elegant piece of writing, but I just gotta say it.  I've been practicing martial arts for 15 years and I watch countless people getting started and making this same mistake, and yes, I was guilty at the beginning. This is SO, so important.  Go. Slow. Go slow. I'm a pretty big guy, I've always played sports, I have a lot of power, and as soon as I got a taste of what it feels like to put that power into a THWACK on a bag or pair of pads, man, I wanted more. You see it happen all the time. But then you get power thirsty, to an extent that your technique just hasn't reached yet, and this is when you start developing bad habits and, most ironically, completely preventing yourself from really developing the power of which you're capable (not to mention speed and accuracy and all that, but I'll just keep saying power because it's easier that way). The real power comes from striking mechanics and economy of motion and most effectively transferring every pound of body weight into a strike.  So, go slow. I used to stay behind after every class and have a fight with the heavy bag in slow motion. You know not really, but I would practice the techniques we learned as slow as possible. Paying attention to how my feet were pivoting and how my weight was transferred and how you extend your arms in relation to how the rest of your body is ""unloading"" and how to keep your hands up and breathe with your strikes, how to RELAX, you get the idea. But I went slow. I did this over and over and over, and let it all come together fluidly, and while there is always more to learn, I feel very proud and confident with how that patience has developed my striking.  And man, NOW I can feel that power. Once you get that technique burned into your muscle memory, and you put some speed and power behind it. What a feeling.  Hey, HAVE FUN! Don't get discouraged. Kicks especially are gonna feel awkward as fuck at first. Just laugh at yourself. And as others around you might be slamming the pads, have the courage to...you guessed it...GO SLOW, and work on your form. They're not gonna think you're wimpy. We've all been there.  Did I mention, HAVE FUN?!"
martialarts,3e14tr,aznednacni,8,Tue Jul 21 04:59:52 2015 UTC,"I can't agree with you more, about practicing drills slowly. It takes a ton of time, but even 30 minutes a day of slow - observant - repetitions will see you having weekly gains.   But another thing to mention, and I don't know if this is obvious, but you also have to perform at full speed routinely as well. Often times there are techniques you won't understand unless you are maxing out, such as foot placement - into - strike."
martialarts,3e14tr,Jetman123,3,Tue Jul 21 07:11:24 2015 UTC,"Absolutely! Great addition. And besides, full speed is the fun part anyway : )"

martialarts,3e14tr,diiegooo,3,Tue Jul 21 18:11:50 2015 UTC,"I dig this comment! one of the best ones; top add my two cents: when doing drills and combinations aim! aim, aim, aim at their face. when I am training and its say, a counter so the technique requires you to slip first, nothing, to me, is worse than somome swinging above my head. when doing so, I try to make it as realistic as possible. not throwing to actually hit them with 100% speed and technique but to make sure they move and do so correctly. and I personally love being corrected! if I'm practicing a slip drill and someone tells me I'm using my hips to move then I am thankful and focus on using my knees and legs to get out tha' way! correcting any of my form really. also, let someone know when to speed up as well as slow down. imo, sparring is different and like someone else said most experienced people will at least match your intensity level. unless they're dicks or twats respectively. but yeah, you should move slow and focus on moving correctly with every muscle being relaxed until that last moment. Bruce Lee has awesome quotes ""do not clench fist until impact"", ""boards don't hit back"" (which is why a good partner who corrects your form is invaluable). Good luck and have fun!"
martialarts,3e14tr,doboksquawk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:16:43 2015 UTC,"although it's already been said: wrap your hands, wear a cup and headgear, and don't cut corners on mouthpieces etc. that kindof stuff can't be stressed enough. esp mouthpieces, headgear, handwraps, and cup. breathing properly is essential especially when you see a blow coming that'd be too late to block or slip. your hips should help with every strike as should the rest of your body! oh yeah! and when sparring many people enjoy the tit for tat what I mean is when you jab or leg kick the opponent will usually wanna...get even. so do with that what you will but when people expect you to get even and troy feint, that is a lovely trick. it goes both way. and watch your facial expression when sparring it may at times betray your feint. or movements period rather. Oh! and have fun!"
martialarts,3e14tr,flamesflight,2,Tue Jul 21 18:25:03 2015 UTC,"I love this comment. I've seen so many people try to focus on power or speed or whatever instead of focusing on their technique. And it always limits them in the end. Everything else comes from good technique.  I also have to reiterate what others have said about feeling awkward at first. No matter what athletic training you've done in the past, the kind of movement you will do in martial arts is different. Everybody feels like a bumbling fool at first. That'll fade soon enough."
martialarts,3e14tr,TheCowgirlCrusher,13,Tue Jul 21 21:46:55 2015 UTC,"Wear a cup, each time every time."

martialarts,3e14tr,KennethGloeckler,3,Tue Jul 21 12:13:12 2015 UTC,"I have gotten to the gym and realized I forgot my cup.  The first time, I finished class.  Every time after that, I packed my shit up and went home."
martialarts,3e14tr,robertbieber,7,Tue Jul 21 17:20:33 2015 UTC,"Nothing. Martial arts classes get new students all the time. There is no need to overcomplicate things at all. Just relax and go. This will be true for weeks.  Then when you have gotten used to the training, you can start making up your mind on how to optimize it. Don't overstimulate yourself."
martialarts,3e14tr,Fenor,6,Tue Jul 21 09:37:39 2015 UTC,"When you're sparring with someone who's a lot better than you (read: everyone else in the gym when you're getting started ;)), setting the intensity level will be kind of a collaborative process.  They will (hopefully) start pretty light on you, and as you demonstrate that you can take it and you're throwing back at them they'll start to ramp it up.  If it gets to be too much you can back off a little, and they should back off a little too.  Unless you're seriously preparing for a fight, no one wants to push you to a point where you're gonna get hurt bad.  Whatever you do, don't get cocky at the beginning and start going after someone as hard as you can: that's a really good way to get yourself knocked out."
martialarts,3e14tr,Arctictwist,2,Tue Jul 21 05:58:00 2015 UTC,"Whatever you do, don't get cocky at the beginning and start going after someone as hard as you can: that's a really good way to get yourself knocked out.   listen to this guy, if some new guy try to get cocky on his first lession, i try to tell them to don't try to be cocky, if he do it again he's going to have a bad time. others might skip the warning the first time"

martialarts,3e14tr,hkdharmon,4,Tue Jul 21 07:37:49 2015 UTC,"It's been brought up a few times and I'll go ahead and reinforce it: Go slow. Getting crappy technique is going to hinder you in the long run. While having a lot of natural athleticism is going to carry you faster than many people who aren't as active as it sounds like you have been. That said, utilizing your body in Muay Thai might be a touch different than what you're used to doing.  Remember to relax. No one gets a gold star at the end of class for knocking out the air. You don't ""win"" a sparring round with a training partner. Remember why you are sparring when you start doing it, because there's very few things that will be frustrating like getting hurt and unable to train because someone thought light-spar means to go full throttle when they get hit.   You're going to get hit in the face when you start sparring. It's going to suck. Enjoy it, because one day you'll be doing the same to your training partners.   Oh, and turn your hips over during a round-house kick. It fixes a huge number of issues."

A regular beginner class is usually 10-15 minutes of skipping rope, and then there will be a bit of shadowboxing followed by partenring up and hitting pads. Hitting pads is the biggest part of the class usually. Then you might finish with hitting the bag or other exercices made to burn you out as much as possible. After that, my beginner class usually finishes with some relatively intense ab work."

You are there to learn and improve, you're not there to show off how good you are or convince anyone of your manliness.  My experience has been that the people who go in knowing it will be hard are the ones who do best.  There's a guy I train with sometimes, and when we had an opportunity to train with some very experienced and skilled instructors he would not shut up.  For a solid three days at least he was talking nonstop.  He was not there to learn, he was there to impress the instructor with how much he knows.  The end result is that he didn't hear anything they were saying, and on the third day he was asking questions that had been explained and answered on the first day."

You don't need to do it in front of him, but if the people who witnessed this -- heck even two of the people who witnessed this -- talk to the instructors that should be enough.

I haven't seen too many, but luckily our top sparring student delighted in reality checks... So there's one option? Are you WTF or ITF?  Joking aside, find a way to get evidence of stuff you've described. Film a few trainings saying you just want to watch your own technique (like how golfers watch their swing). Then get rid of him once you have what you need. I personally wouldn't take any of his nonsense any longer than I needed to."

A more reasonable way, if you prefer, would be to talk to the senior instructors and say that Mr. M is making the club a very uncomfortable place for you to practice and how his poor behavior and inappropriate language in front of children is going to drive away members, if it hasn't already started to do so."

I know for sure that, if an untrained new guy became physically agressive at my judo club, he would be made to instantly regret that decision.  The guy is a crazy asshole, and the fact that he is still allowed to attend classes doesn't speak well of the club management.

martialarts,3e0r1h,howdoiflynow,2,Tue Jul 21 04:56:51 2015 UTC,"What's the difference beteween the basic Taekwondo Roundhouse Kick and a ""Kickboxing"" Roundhouse Kick?   Very little if any. The misconception here is that Taekwondo, Karate, Muay Thai, Kickboxing, etc. etc. all are completely different which is not necessarily true. Yes, their are slight differences in mechanics due to each sport having their own ruleset.   WTF Sport Taekwondo, for example, scores kicks via contact with the Instep of the Foot. Taekwondo kicks also, mostly, all start from the chamber position and end chambering back whereas Muay Thai Roundhouse kicks, for example, swing and hit with the instep shin being a ""full-contact"" sport that doesn't have a focus on points.  However, the proper, basic mechanic of the kick - turning your hips, hand positioning, etc. for all styles should all be very similar. We have several guys that crosstrain in Muay Thai and Kickboxing at my Taekwondo Dojang and one of my Masters used to compete in Thai Boxing competitions back in Asia so I'm speaking from my own personal experience - not just theories pulled out of my butt.  Semantics aside, the basics are the same. If this guy can't perform a proper ""TKD form kick,"" I would definitely question his credibility as a decent ""kickboxer.""   EDIT: Just my two cents.  EDIT: For the sake of my example above, I was referring to the basic Roundhouse Kick.  EDIT: Meant shin not instep. corrected it"
martialarts,3e0r1h,gorchitza,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:31:54 2015 UTC,"To be fair the roundhouse kick specifically can vary a bit from style to style, especially the chamber. For example TKD has a forward chamber and Kyokushin has a side chamber, Muay Thai has their baseball bat. With that said, I find the TKD roundhouse preferable over the others in most cases. It has slightly less power but is faster and less telegraphed, it still has power way beyond knockout power so why the hell not.  Though what this guy is doing looks like some odd mix of whatever he likes. It's like a Pit Chagi but towards the head, with the rear foot only rotated 90 degrees, terrible."

One of the black belt instructors used to train kickboxing with this same guy and kicked M's ass badly multiple times, and he's fantastic at TKD. Unfortunatly M doesn't act like a badass towards him.  In fact I'd say there are a few people, even I have had success sparring with Mr. M (though not under kickboxing rules).

martialarts,3e0r1h,safeatworkacct,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:38:28 2015 UTC,"Depends on the culture of the school, not the quality of instruction. I've also seen schools where delusional assholes get thrashed for causing problems be chastised for behaving in an immature and undisciplined manner.  And, frankly, I agree more with that perspective. Self-defense is less about kicking someone's ass, more about avoiding conflict in the first place. If you can get out of the situation without having to beating this guy into the pavement (and it's clear that not every option to that end has been exhausted, yet), then doing so is unnecessary. It's also not at all indicative of the quality of training at the school.  Though maybe that's more prominent in grappling arts? Striking arts seem to have a stronger stigma that way, because you can't ""win"" without either hurting the other guy into submission or causing a concussion."

Where I am from, open training is where you get to work on whatever you want, hit the bags or ask someone to spar. Mr. M has a point here."

Find a new school anyway, because he's probably just in it for the money. I caught one of my kids pulling this shit, I'd probably dress him down like a drill sergeant before booting his ass.

Given the extremely low wages for most MMA athletes they aren't able to buy the high-end stuff like most professional athletes, and so they more often have detectable traces left coming up to fights."

Had one of my team mates cut is OWN forehead open with his knee while doing shrimp drills of all things.  Another dude hurt his ribs doing takedown drills, guy lost his footing on the slippery mats and came down extra hard on the double leg and just shoulder right in the ribs.  Most of the injuries are from tired people on their 100th rep of something just being inattentive of slipping and things going slightly wrong for a second."
martialarts,3e0yhf,Kintanon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:22:06 2015 UTC,"Guy I was supposed to fight twisted his ankle a week before the fight. Not sure how he did it. I saw a lot of hyper extensions of knees and elbows. Mostly from a guy not tapping or someone ""snapping"" a hold instead if ""slipping"" it. Lots of jammed fingers, poked eyes, some guys pissed blood, few concussions, few cut eyes, black eyes, lots of bruises, few cracked ribs, never saw a broken bone though other then an nose or rib, maybe an eye socket. I take that back, I broke my 5th metatarsle (sp?), foot bone, on a pad. Guess my foot tiwisted funny or something. Brawler or boxer breaks are also common. I've seen two personally, after the fact. Tennis elbow of all things... Hmm sure I'll add more.. Just things I remember from the years.   Edit: realized you are talking about pre fight injuries. Alot of what I listed can happen while sparing or training with a partner. Most guys I knew did only solo work or light sparing before to avoid this. Some people push hard before a fight. This is where I think the innjury happens. Ohh I can push that extra 10min on the treadmill then do a sprint. Tired and miss steap spraining ankle. It also could be a mental thing, just not ready so they make up the injury or intentionally get hurt, of make it seam worse then it is. Hope this answers."

A stray knee that cuts the head, a funny fall that twists the ankle, not noticing the two guys wrestling behind you and tripping over them.   Its a constant balancing act between training as intensely as you can and keeping yourself health.  Most people who train MMA dont really have to worry about it. They might get injured in training but they wont be putting anywhere near the mat time and training intensity of the professionals."

And, you still haven't given me a citation where any professional says it's necessary to drop your guard.   So we agree it's a bad idea to drop your guard when kicking? Cool. So, my point stands: it's a bad idea to practice dropping your guard when you kick. You don't need to do it to gain power. Ever. It adds nothing to the power of your kick. You could have your arms cut off at the shoulder and still kick as powerfully.  Don't hold your breath waiting for any videos. I mean, you haven't even told me what you want a video of. ""Outclassing"", or something. Whatever that means. What's that supposed to prove, anyway?"
martialarts,3dyo7i,KarateCowboy,3,Tue Jul 21 00:17:37 2015 UTC,"The reason why I posted that quote from a professional fighter, a champion, giving tips for how to do it not just in theory but, as you would say in reality,   Dude, every single professional or even amateur fighter will tell you that. I assure you Davis did the same thing because it's the only way to get power.  There is a reason everyone does it a certain way, it's because it works.   It adds nothing to the power of your kick. You could have your arms cut off at the shoulder and still kick as powerfully.   OH MY GOD YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT JUST SHUT UP.  So, I'm still waiting for the video of you generating just as much power whilst maintaining a picture-perfect guard.  Still waiting for your proof.   At this point it's clear that you've committed to a point and are terribly afraid of admitting any wrong.  Grow up."
martialarts,3dyo7i,Enthused_Llama,-3,Tue Jul 21 00:20:10 2015 UTC,"Well no, you have no idea what you're talking about, and your childish ranting and tantrums show you compensating for the lack of substance.  The power in the kick comes from the hips and the torso. Dropping your guard adds nothing to that momentum. That's why an armless man could kick just as hard. The momentum as you drop your arms adds nothing as it is travelling away from your opponent. You claim Davis would assert that, but he says to keep your guard up, which is the opposite."

Again, distracting from the actual point. Nice ad hominem, by the way. (Yes, I've definitely done it too, but you're such a fan of fallacies). But yes, be sure to distract from the point because you've got no substance.   The power in the kick comes from the hips and the torso.    The torso...you mean...that thing my arms are attached to?   Dropping your guard adds nothing to that momentum.   No, but twisting your arms like almost every fighter does matters.   You claim Davis would assert that, but he says to keep your guard up, which is the opposite.   Every single fighter worth their salt will tell you to do that, and they're not wrong, but there's a slight difference in actual practice which you would acknowledge and know about if you did anything other than troll around and act like you're King Shit on Turd Island.  Now you're obviously terrible afraid of admitting fault so I'm going to take the choice out of your hands, I'm disabling replies so don't bother responding with some more desperate asinine wailing.

It's not that they're celebrities so they must be right, it's that this ***** is literally their job. That's like saying bringing up Ronnie Coleman in an argument about competitive lifting is an appeal to celebrity. Citing experts is not a fallacy.   ""Bas Ruten is awesome. Bas Ruten sometimes gets a little sloppy and lets his guard down when he kicks. Therefore, it's a good idea to let your guard down when you kick!"".  I knew an electrician whose job was fixing wiring in houses. That electrician was sloppy and didn't cut the power one time before working on a box. Now that electrician is dead. Must be a good idea to not cut the power when working on a box, right?  Besides, you don't have any citations where experts say ""It's a good idea to drop your guard when you kick"". So you don't have any 'citations'. You just have ""sometimes Bas Ruten gets a little sloppy. Therefore, it's fine for me to do it left and right"".  I don't need to post videos of me kicking anything or outclassing anything. It's irrelevant to the fact that dropping your guard is a bad and goes against fundamentals.

You see the same thing in a thousand videos of a thousand people much more qualified than you, and yet you stand here and tell me it's wrong? Yes, dropping your guard is a bad idea, but in some instances it is necessary. You can't move your whole body if you try to keep one part of it rock solid, and recruiting mass is how you hit hard.  So either step up to the plate and provide solid proof of all the mad shit you're talking, or shut the hell up and stop talking down to people.  Nut up or shut up.  Prove it or get out.

martialarts,3dvskh,dandeezy,5,Mon Jul 20 03:44:38 2015 UTC,"The really funny thing is that if you were to read his description, without watching the video, you would think that the guy has some sound advice:   ""What to do if you're only armed with a sword and someone has invaded your home. None of these techniques are foolproof, and the best thing to do would be to simply not be seen. Try to get a look at him, call the police. If you have the means to do so legally, purchase a cheap firearm for home defense. I choose not to, that is my choice, but I will gladly admit that it is much more useful for defending your home than any kind of blade, no matter how skilled you are with one.  Another thing, insure stuff you buy. If you lose something in a burglary, and have no insurance for it, you're screwed. Hopefully the police will find the guy, but if they don't, you lose your stuff. No material possession is worth your life, only engage a burglar if you or your family's lives depend on it. Shut yourself in your room, make sure you have a window for emergency escape, barricade the door, and CALL THE POLICE.  Everyone's situation is different, if you have a child in their own room, go there first, secure the child, and barricade that room. As I said before, if you can, buy a gun. You don't have to take it to the range every day, you don't have to become a master at handling it, just get in some practice and keep it in a drawer. Improvise, improvise, improvise. Anything can be a weapon, umbrellas, lamps, shelves, FRICKIN ANYTHING. It doesn't need to have bullets or an edge to be a weapon. I once heard a story where someone threw their damn mattress at a burglar and knocked him down the stairs.  Use your surroundings, think about who you live with, what your enemy is, what they're equipped with. Most of the time, a burglar won't have their gun at the ready, it'll be in their pocket or stuck in their pants, perhaps in a holster. BE SMART, BE FAST, BE READY, BE SAFE."""

Feel free to report back to /r/martialarts with your experiences observing classes and any thoughts or worries you have and we might be able to help you further.   But any of us saying you will be fine in x art or too totally avoid Y art is just making a guess, maybe even an educated guess but still a guess.   I also recommend not writing anything off until you have at least watched a class. Maybe grappling wont be as bad for you as you think, maybe it will be far worse but go watch a class anyway and see what you think.   When you do pick a place to train make sure people you train with are aware of your condition."

martialarts,3dvhtq,farkoman,2,Mon Jul 20 00:10:38 2015 UTC,Taekwondo. It's mostly legs.
martialarts,3dvhtq,anonlymouse,2,Mon Jul 20 09:47:37 2015 UTC,"I have hyper-mobility and I tried a few things. I did a little BJJ, MMA, boxing and kung fu.   BJJ never gave me any issues, except my ankle got hurt in a heelhook, but my knee was okay so I got off easy and I could have tapped. On the other hand I can get out of situations where others might get caught, but this is a dangerous game as your muscles don't work right, when you overextend, so you're essentially gambling whenever you overextend. At first it should be a priority not to do it at all, but as you learn, you can play around with it when going easy.  MMA fucked me up. Day one I got picked up and dropped on my bad shoulder, dislocating it. I walked around with this injury for 5 months (while training again after a one week break) until a fall down the stairs knocked it back in place. I thought it was permanent so that was nice. I had a lot of other injuries doing MMA as well, but not related to hyper-mobility.  Boxing has thrown out both my shoulders and set me back a few weeks every time. One of them might have been while doing MMA when I think back, but it was doing a boxing move/punch so I'll place it here under boxing. Anything looping is potentially risky for me, but I usually always get away with it. When I don't, it fucks me up though. I could go on after an injury, but when I cool down I'm fucked. I tend to throw mostly jabs, straight punches and tight hooks and uppercuts on the inside. I mix it up of course, but that style works for me.  Kung fu messed up my shoulder as well, but we had ground fighting in our style, so that was a takedown that was both poorly executed and poorly defended. An accident essentially.  Besides that I threw out my 'good' shoulder with a weak ass load on the 'dip machine' in the gym. That one fucked me up as hard as the first MMA shoulder injury, so if you ask me, I think you could get hurt rearranging your furniture so you should pick whatever martial art you like the most. The one that feeds your inner fire.  I think the reason I haven't had any really bad injuries (things I didn't come back from) is that when you do a martial art, you're entirely consumed by it. In the moments you practice it, I mean. You're aware of your body and your protect yourself and learn about your limits as you go. Yes injuries will happen and yes they will hurt, but you'll get stronger and better at knowing your limits and working around them. It's really true when they say no one is 100% in the fight game, not just with regards to injuries, but with regards to style. Some people are stiff, some have hyper-mobility and some are short while others are tall. We fight differently and there's room for that in most disciplines. In fact it's kind of what makes it all so great.  Look up Jean Jacques Machado and watch a few videos. His left hand has a birth defect and he only has a pinky and a thumb on it and he is a legit powerhouse in BJJ."

martialarts,3dv6am,Tawdry,8,Sun Jul 19 20:34:35 2015 UTC,"We trained with knives and learned how to push someone who have a knive on your throat and run. [...] We trained to take the gun of someone who point it to our stomach.   If you had a good time, great.  However, if this is something you plan to regularly attend, consider asking the instructor to practice how not to allow someone to get a knife to your throat or a gun to your belly.  One of the best critiques of martial arts based approaches to self defense is that they always start from the ""oh shit"" position because it's cool. In other words, let me teach you a complex escape to a life or death situation.  While its sexy, it's also stupid IMHO -- as if someone has managed to get a knife to your throat or a gun to your belly, it means you've probably already made a ton of mistakes to get into that position.  I'd much rather focus a significant amount of my self defense training on not making those initial mistakes. And folks like Tony Blauer and Rory Miller have put together programs to do exactly that.  Disarms and weapons clears are great skill developers. But they shouldn't form the foundation of a good self defense program. Basic physical skills,  verbal deescalation, and situational management skills are the best foundation."

martialarts,3dwf5p,ipoopbycandlelight,4,Mon Jul 20 02:29:03 2015 UTC,"""Women's Self Defense"" is a brutal classification that targets women in most cases through fear. Any good martial arts class teaches you ""Self Defense"" and it doesnt look like this. Real fighting isn't choreographed, real fighting is brutal and carnal. If you want to be someone who teaches ""Women's self defense""  I think you should be prepared (with the students consent) to initiate full force over the defendant and also be prepared to get some keys in your face."
martialarts,3dwf5p,RainmakerG-0,10,Mon Jul 20 11:04:11 2015 UTC,"There's are three practical reasons for a ""Women's Self Defense"" class:   That many women are initially uncomfortable working with men and doing a ""women's only"" class creates a psychologically/emotionally safe training environment for them. Additionally, based on previous experiences, there's a high chance that you will have someone in the class who has been a victim of past violence -- it's critical to help them get through that without creating a triggering environment (at least at first). That there are a number of psychological, emotional, and physical barriers to self defense that are culturally gendered. The cultural expectations and pressures on women are profoundly different than on men, and a good Women's self defense program should take these into account and structure itself in such a way to help participants over come them. That there are certain defense scenarios that women are far more likely to be in than men. As with the point above, having a women's only class allows more concentration on those points.   To be clear, mixed gender self defense classes can work as well. And ultimately, I see women's only classes as a ""gateway"" to mixed gender classes.  Also, regardless of what the makeup of a self defense class is, everything should be taught with progressive resistance."
martialarts,3dwf5p,mattBernius,4,Mon Jul 20 14:01:37 2015 UTC,"Good overview, I overlooked 1 in my previous statement but only because I have seen so many horrid female self defense courses. Self defense instructors take note."
martialarts,3dwf5p,RainmakerG-0,3,Mon Jul 20 14:09:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks. As you can tell, it's something I'm passionate about.   I overlooked 1 in my previous statement but only because I have seen so many horrid female self defense courses.   Oh, don't get me wrong, I think most (at least 50% of) Women's Self Defense classes suck. But that's (a) because I'm a snob, and (b) I've seen too many that only pay lip service to the three things I outlined.  Though to be completely transparent, I think most (at least 50% of) Mixed Gender and Male only Self Defense classes suck as well."
martialarts,3dwf5p,mattBernius,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:14:29 2015 UTC,"Self defense classes are meant to prepare a person to avoid and/or handle an equal or bigger opponent in a not so calm situation.  Teaching people proper technique in such environment makes them less stressed when they're learning the basics, but keeping them in the same, calm and familiar environment creates a false sense of safety.  For that reason, mixed classes give the best results, especially for women who get to train with men, since most women are attacked by men."
martialarts,3dwf5p,edoxil,3,Mon Jul 20 14:15:53 2015 UTC,"Clearly you missed where I wrote:   To be clear, mixed gender self defense classes can work as well.

Also, regardless of what the makeup of a self defense class is, everything should be taught with progressive resistance.   To that point:   For that reason, mixed classes give the best results, especially for women who get to train with men, since most women are attacked by men.   I completely agree. But there are a lot of women who are not prepared to start at that point. And often they are the ones who need to develop the skills the most. And this only gets worse when you take into consideration the fact that in most western countries, Women are culturally conditioned against defending themselves.  I have no problem with the idea of meeting them where they currently are and getting them up to the point where they can work with men rather than dropping them in at the deep end of the pool and not having them come back. Some women are prepared off the bat to work with men, and there's no reason to prevent them from doing that. Others are going to need more work -- and if you're the instructor and accepting the responsibility of teaching them self defense, its your responsibility to do everything you can to build them up so they can eventually work in a mixed gender environment."
martialarts,3dwf5p,mattBernius,2,Mon Jul 20 14:21:26 2015 UTC,"You're right, sorry for missing the first part.   I haven't said that (all) women should start training with men from the very beginning. I do agree, though, that after some time most of them should ""advance"" and start training with men."
martialarts,3dwf5p,edoxil,3,Mon Jul 20 14:38:12 2015 UTC,"Cool. Glad to see we're in agreement.  I've met a number of more militant Self Defense folks who feel that unless a woman is prepared to go into a mixed class from day 1 it's not worth it to teach her.  As you can tell, I have a real problem with that line of thought."
martialarts,3dwf5p,mattBernius,2,Mon Jul 20 16:03:34 2015 UTC,This pretty much sums up my feelings on the matter too. Its a shame that as you point out later way too many women's self defense classes don't actually cover these things.  For example in the third one the person creating the course or class should be looking at statistics to see what attacks do happen more commonly to women if the statistics are available.

martialarts,3dwf5p,SWEPOW,0,Mon Jul 20 06:57:46 2015 UTC,"People in martial arts forums have a tendency to undervalue arts and techniques that focus on getting out of or quickly away from trouble, versus arts and techniques that ""defeat"" an opponent.  On top of that, there's also a pretty low representation of ostensibly ""dirty"" techniques like gouges, groin kicks, hair pulls et al.  To wit, I recall a video posted here recently of a finger grab (systema?) that was only posted to make fun of it.  I'm going to say there's value in things like this for people who are either aware of their physical limitations, know they lack the will to commit to an all out fight, want to focus solely on disabling the opponent in the most efficient way possible (""rules"" or social norms be damned), or some combination of the above."
martialarts,3dwf5p,stultus_respectant,6,Mon Jul 20 07:03:54 2015 UTC,The problem with this video isn't the end goal. I think everyone on /r/martialarts agree that running away is the best self defense. The problem with this one is that it would never work against an uncooperative opponent. For example; at 0:15 of the video she demostrates how she gets away from a headlock. She just punches him in the belly and after 3-4 punches he lets her go. A person of her size in that position would never be able to escape by doing that. Teaching people to react in that way will simply give them a false confidence and will possibly increase the risk of getting hurt in an altercation since they will just escalate the situation.
martialarts,3dwf5p,SWEPOW,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:10:27 2015 UTC,"What didn't translate in the video is she bit him in the abdomen while in the headlock, then repeatedly punched him in the groin. I think they are working on improving the presentation of some of the more subtle parts."
martialarts,3dwf5p,Carlos13th,3,Mon Jul 20 10:59:18 2015 UTC,Even so mechanically breaking the headlock is a better idea than hitting them and hoping it will make them leave you go. I am not saying don't use punches to the groin but do so alongside actually breaking the head lock not instead of it.
martialarts,3dwf5p,sreiches,3,Mon Jul 20 11:05:32 2015 UTC,"This is one of the things Ju-Jutsu advocates that I've also (very occasionally) seen in Aikido. Use atemi to soften the opponent for a mechanically sound technique. They're usually thinking about applying a throw or lock, but it potentially applies when trying to get out of one as well."
martialarts,3dwf5p,Carlos13th,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:39:37 2015 UTC,Yeah it makes sense. You see it in MMA too where someone will hit someone while trying to sink in a rear naked choke for example.  Some people take it to far in my opinion with some claiming the strike will stun the opponent allowing you to do techniques that seem to require the opponent to stand still and not fight back but I think the underlying idea is a good one.
martialarts,3dwf5p,sreiches,2,Mon Jul 20 14:52:51 2015 UTC,"I would agree. It think it fills much the same place as small joint manipulation. Helping one finish or escape a technique with a technically sound ""gross"" movement to match."

I won't comment on the bite. However, it's pretty clear that she's also doing a quick compression on the floating ribs. If she's done that correctly that's going to significantly lighten the initial lock."

martialarts,3dwf5p,stultus_respectant,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:02:08 2015 UTC,"it's just that it meant to slap someone into a pain compliance hold for pointing at you   No, it's just a demonstration.  I've had this done from many different positions, but this is the best way to illustrate it.  The idea that this technique exists to punish people who are just pointing at you aggressively is silly.  Most opponents don't punch, kick, or shoot like they do in demonstrations, but you still have to effectively teach the techniques.   This is the sort of thing that's really just marketed to people looking to stroke their ego.   These techniques are real, are surprisingly easy to execute, and are incredibly painful.  I pointed out in that same post that while not even training this art, we were taught about locks like this and would have instructors grab loose fingers in sparring to make the point crystal clear.  You're also sort of proving my point, and perhaps why this sort of thing is underrepresented around here.  It's not even like that finger video was some obscure, bullshido nonsense: it's Krav Maga."
martialarts,3dwf5p,Apollo78,2,Tue Jul 21 19:11:30 2015 UTC,"Oh no, I'm not saying small joint manipulation is BS. I guarantee you if I was threading underneath someone's neck for a choke or something and they grabbed my finger it'd get my attention. I'm saying putting it into the context of ""countering"" someone pointing at you, even in a demo, is seemingly far too geared towards making this guy's system seem generically badass then actually applicable. I get that people don't always attack realistically in demos, but there's simply not an attack here. Which kind begs the question of, why wouldn't you have them doing a realistic attack if the counter is mechanically sound? Like what I said about countering a choke. That's probably a decent application, so why not do a mechanically similarities from there? Or maybe as part of a disarm, parry or anything that's going to have you at that range."
martialarts,3dwf5p,stultus_respectant,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:53:31 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely not trying to argue with you about joint locks or suggest you're saying they're BS.  My point was ""dirty"" techniques are underrepresented around here, and this is an example of a rare bit of demonstration that was quickly derided (if not outright mocked).  The fact that we're still talking about it all seems to prove my point.  For example:   why wouldn't you have them doing a realistic attack if the counter is mechanically sound?   If joint locks are a real thing, that you're not saying is BS, why should it matter how he's demonstrating it?  I agree there could be other ways to demonstrate it, but if nothing else, is this not a clear demonstration of the principles for which this works?  It's just a brief demo of a technique; I don't think we can really draw any conclusions about ""ego"" or ""this guy's system"", or any of that.  He doesn't make any wild claims, or suggest you check out his DVD, or any of that.  These things are a dime a dozen on YouTube.  I'd rather talk about the video this is a comment thread for, and the points I made in my original post.  Why are we nitpicking over whether one example of a ""dirty"" technique is valid or not, and if it could be demonstrated better?  Can we talk about the value of learning non-traditional techniques that focus on escaping a fight, especially for people who might lack the physical presence to (ostensibly) ""win"" a physical confrontation?"
martialarts,3dwf5p,Apollo78,2,Tue Jul 21 22:28:02 2015 UTC,"Meh, I suppose that's fair. About the focus on non traditional techniques with the focus on escaping though, I really have no beefs with that. I do sport jujitsu, but whenever I'm thinking about defensive applications that's where my mind goes. I'm not a particularly small dude, I'm not massive either, but I'm 6ftish about 180. Running is still the best damn option there is, which is why I focus on escaping mount, fighting back to standing from my back, takedowns ect. Obviously there are other things available to me because I'm not particularly small, but those are my focuses for about the same reasons."
martialarts,3dwf5p,stultus_respectant,2,Tue Jul 21 23:49:28 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  Do you think that in a ""real"" situation that you'd have any qualms about nut punching, gouging, et al?  Do you think there'd be value in training that more specifically if you were smaller than you are?  I think your weight and build would probably let you train about anything you want, but what if you were 5'5"" 120?  I know that some of my buddies who trained similarly to you were surprised by said ""dirty"" techniques in actual fights, whereas some of my buddies who trained things like Muay Thai were willing to do the most brutal things to people (one of them fishooked the crap out of a guy, for example).  I don't really get a good sense around here about how people feel about dirty stuff, and people that train it.  edit: thanks for the discussion.  Upvotes."
martialarts,3dwf5p,Apollo78,2,Tue Jul 21 23:55:43 2015 UTC,"My stance on dirty stuff of all kinds has always been that it's really just another tool in the arsenal. I'm perfectly willing to do anything short of biting if the situation calls for it and biting is really just off the table because of bloodborn illness, so even that if I think I'm gonna die and have no other options. I'd never go out of my way to do more harm then I felt necessary, but I'm willing to kill someone who's trying to kill me so doing something like a groin kick isn't off the table at all. My only real gripes with dirty stuff is that it's often held up as a substitute to conventional training which I feel is needed to adequately defend (as in covering up, slipping punches, takedown defense ect. not the general ""self defense"") and to get into positions wher it would make the most of it (like clinching up to get in range for a knee to the groin.). There's also the issue that a lot of what is commonly considered dirty, not all of course, is functioning off of pain for stopping power rather than mechanically disabling something. The later doesn't mean that they're useless, but it is a limiting factor in where they're applicable. Then again this begs the question of what would be ""dirty"", personally I'd consider some conventional strikes dirty when applied to the right places due to the fact that they could either kill abnormally easily or just don't have a capacity to be toned down in terms of what injury they inflict when being thrown live. Like elbows to the base of the skull or temple which I'd say do mechanically shut down a person's ability to attack (obviously not in a joint lock-y way, more conclusively.), but to my understanding really can't be thrown at something close to 100% without fucking up your training partner. Those are the sorts of things I'd hesitate to do just because there's really not much of a way to do them effectively without committing to seriously injuring the person, but again that's only to a point. I feel like variations of that sort of ground and pound would be my go to if I ever seriously felt in danger not only because it's something I feel has effectiveness, but to be honest it's kind of a caveman response to a threat that might happen naturally if I get to mount or someone's back in a fight or flight situation and I'm just kinda beyond finer motor control. Of course there's the issue of how applicable that'd be for a smaller person, but that kind of loops back too my point about using conventional training as a delivery system. It'd definitely be more difficult for a smaller person to use conventional fighting techniques, but I feel like it's more worth their time to figure out what works for them in a conventional sense and then figure out what works from there in terms of dirty stuff given their then developed skill set. Though I'll be honest I might be a little biased given that my 140lb instructor regularly tosses me around like a ragdoll, I do think a lot of that is probably going to come from grappling range where size already matters less unless it's a sizable difference.  TLDR: basically I feel like it needs to be a tack on to an existing skillset which covers what it doesn't, but is otherwise fine. Similarly to how you'd want an MMA-esque unarmed skillset before moving onto designated self defense which would deal with weapons, de-escalating ect. It should be trained by smaller people, not because it's more effective for them , but because they might need it more. Though that should really still be a tack on to their conventional skillset, one which I feel should be more centered around grappling because it can help level things in its own way and can keep them upright against takedowns or get back up after getting hit with one, both of which would likely be more important for smaller people given that they want to run."

I view people's affinity for samurai as a form of orientelism which believe it or not is akin to a form of racism. You have to look at samurai objectively and analyze their strong and weak points. I think survivalife above makes a good point. If in fact all you need with a light saber is to touch the opponent to do extensive damage a European fencer would be well suited to wield a saber. Ive read that a thrust is quicker, more damaging, and harder to defend than a slash. In my experience in filipino weapons arts for nearly 10 years it's true. Any weapons/blade art would probably translate well to light saber combat but some may be better than others if you take an objective look."

martialarts,3drnea,Grarvindur,-6,Sat Jul 18 20:12:48 2015 UTC,The octagon is an awful invention.
martialarts,3drnea,Grarvindur,4,Sat Jul 18 22:35:44 2015 UTC,Do you dislike the structure or the culture around it?
martialarts,3drnea,Grarvindur,-4,Sat Jul 18 23:09:32 2015 UTC,"A lot of MMA fans seem more interested in blood and injuries than the technical aspect of the sport. I believe that this bloodlust comes, atleast partially, from the arenas design. It largely resembles animals fighting in a cage, which just fuels this bloodlust.  The athletes are hard working and very skilled for the most part, I think it's a shame it gets degraded to cockfighting level more or less.  So my answer to the question is that I think it deserves a big part of the blame for the bad rep MMA gets and the unsportsmanlike behavior that occurs so much more frequently than most other sports."
martialarts,3drnea,Grarvindur,5,Sat Jul 18 23:25:38 2015 UTC,"Well, you can say pretty much the same about boxing, football, kickboxing and pretty much every contact sport so I don't think the arena explanation fits very well (I can perfectly recall people loving Tyson destroying guys in his day without having the slightest bit of knowledge about his technical proficiency).  So there it goes the cage theory. It's much more likely that the limited ruleset attracts a certain mindset that would enjoy that type of entertainment without the cage having much infuence on their tastes.  When you refer to unsportsmanlike, what are you talking about specifically because I can recall massive soccer, hockey and football riots where the fans where the lead initiators but not so many MMA riots (partly because it's relatively small sport compared with those I won't deny that).  So if you don't like the fans cheering for blood, it's quite respectable actually but it doesn't change the fact that compared with almost every other big sport, the desire for blood and injuries doesn't translate into anything as nearly as destructive as supposedly ""healthy"" sports.  Also, the cage is actually quite practical both for striking and grappling, gives very comfortable visibility to the spectators in the arena and at home and it provides much more safety than any ring (I can show you hundreds of incidents of all type of contact sports in rings wher things ended up badly due to the structure)."
martialarts,3drnea,Grarvindur,-4,Sat Jul 18 23:44:12 2015 UTC,"My opinion on the NFL is kind of the same, just like Ice Hockey etc. Most of these big teamsports have a kind of culture that is really quite despicable.  But I guess the difference is that many of the fans are cheering for the blood and not the technical skill etc. I think a lot of the fighters' attitudes are a disgrace and don't behave like sporting athletes. Now this isn't unique to MMA but it really stands out compared to a lot of other things.  Don't misunderstand me though, Boxing and kickboxing also resemble animals fighting in cages , I think that the fact they have more restrictions and don't grapple on the ground detracts from that slightly though. (Not that there's anything wrong with grappling of course, I've been a big grappler - it's just that along with the Octagon it looks bad.) It's still bad and I don't like the rings either.  About it being practical, to be honest I think you can definitely make something that's good to grapple and strike in without it looking like a cockfighting cage. I am aware of the pros, but you CAN have the cake and eat it too in this case.   Running on walls and kicking/punching is unrealistic anyway."
martialarts,3drnea,Carlos13th,5,Sat Jul 18 23:53:03 2015 UTC,"Good to see you have a clear view, even if I don't agree with it.  From my POV it seems you disagree with the athletic culture surrounding many sports and not with the cage itself (it has likely little to no influence).  A purely aesthetical/emotional dislike is respectable up to a point (I don't like certain things on the same basis) but it's just that, emotional.  The cage certainly looks unusual to a lot of people, but it can't be compared with cockfighting for the simple reason that both fighters are always there willingly and understand what they're doing.  That cockfighting comparison has been done time after time but again, it just doesn't stand. It looks brutal, but then you have boxing and kickboxing fights that can last much, much longer and nobody finds them as unusual.  The deciding factor is the relative youth of the sport and the increased presence of blood which makes the fights look wilder than they actually are.  The wall running and punching is not common or high-percentage, but it's doable (I won't post the showtime kick AGAIN because it has been posted enough times) and that's were the cage offers a space for self-expression that a lot of martial arts can't even consider due to their ruleset, the place where they take place or both.  For a lot of people, MMA is simply the new frontier for martial arts and the result has actually reinvigorated the respect and interest in a lot of styles deemed ""useless""."
martialarts,3drnea,madmanslitany,-1,Sun Jul 19 00:06:47 2015 UTC,"We'll agree to disagree. I respect your view, but for me I think the Octagon has a negative effect on the atmosphere because of the way it makes the sport resemble animals fighting in a cage. Even though in REALITY, at it's core, it's obviously not compareable to that.   I think the boxing/kickboxing rings' aesthetic features do the same, but a bit less.   Not talking about the sports themselves now, but I think that the areas/mats for Karate, Taekwondo, Judo etc are a better choice. The problem is having to stop when someone goes outside the boundaries, but is it better or more realistic having walls all around you? I think that's entirely subjective.   Or there could be an elevated platform like in Sanda, or a lowered one, I think there are a lot of possibilities but I'm not that creative."
martialarts,3drnea,Grarvindur,5,Sun Jul 19 00:24:39 2015 UTC,"The cage does have a considerable amount of padding (at least 3 inches by regulation) so in that manner it's no so different to a mat.  Regarding the ""realism"" you could argue that the walls of the cage do actually represent a standard enviroment for most of the world population that live in cities and that are more likely than not to find wall/s in relative proximity during most types of altercations."
martialarts,3drnea,sreiches,-1,Sun Jul 19 00:42:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah that is why I think it would work fine if MMA was on mats, there wouldn't be any ""meta changes"" so to speak because there's not really anything in MMA that's dependent on the walls, just the ground padding.  Well on the ""street"" (god I totally hate using that expression) you are most likely not surrounded in a limited area, but then again you could be attacked inside a building or in an alley.. oh well, these are sports not pure self-defense systems so I guess it's not the most important thing."
martialarts,3drnea,Grarvindur,5,Sun Jul 19 00:53:13 2015 UTC,The main useful thing about the cage is that it clearly shows the outside of the fighting area and you cant just fall out stopping the fight and risking non fighting related injuries.
martialarts,3drnea,sreiches,2,Sun Jul 19 10:06:49 2015 UTC,"I hate that expression too and there's actually no rule in MMA about using or not using the walls, I just mentioned it as a comparison between enviroments.  I prefer the term urban enviroment and it simply referrs to the existence of man-made limits that need to be observed (something that the Russian army noticed when invading the German cities and that would change the nature of armed combat for decades to come).  The cage offers a simbol of that in the walls and the limits they represent and need to be worked around.  The cage does actually have a lot to do with the style of each fighter since by using the limit (as you would in any urban enviroment) either for defense, attack or simply adjusting your strategy you're respecting limits that are always present.  The lack of the walls would probably transform it into some sort of kickboxing with grappling but would not make it less bloody, just less versatile since the fighters would have to be minding the limits to avoid exiting the fighting zone."
martialarts,3drnea,Grarvindur,3,Sun Jul 19 01:02:14 2015 UTC,"I personally like the Sanda and shootboxing rules the most since I'm primarily interested in striking and throws (I totally respect the skill required for ground work and I've tried it on occasion, but it's just not my thing), but from a spectator perspective, I agree, the breaks in the action caused by ring outs is a problem. I also don't like boxing gloves."
martialarts,3drnea,Mikey1ee7,-1,Sun Jul 19 01:11:14 2015 UTC,"I also like those rules the most haha. And yeah if they used MMA gloves I would like it better, even TKD gloves are a lot better IMO."
martialarts,3drnea,Grarvindur,5,Sun Jul 19 11:35:06 2015 UTC,"Pride, which used a standard kickboxing ring, may have lacked elbows, but it allowed soccer kicks and headstomps. I'm not sure the octagonal ring is so much to blame for the attitude of many a UFC fan as the sport's origin, as a vehicle for the Gracie family to promote BJJ as the ultimate martial art in a vale tudo-esque framework.  That said, the octagonal ring is actually thought to contribute to the return of techniques from evasive styles, such as TKD and Karate, to MMA. While a square ring provides four sharp corners, the cage doesn't, allowing for fighters like Machida to better bide their time and pick their opportunities."
martialarts,3drnea,Mikey1ee7,0,Sun Jul 19 20:48:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah as I said to the other guy I don't really appreciate the kickboxing/boxing rings either, I think whatever negative attributes come with the Octagon comes to some degree in the kickboxing rings too, and you are right that more space makes for some interesting change.  I would be interested in seeing how it would work in some type of open mat like Karate, TKD, Judo, BJJ etc, I'm sure there may be some reset but if there are clear warnings by the judge it may not be a big problem. Is it more or less realistic than 8 walls? Don't know, but it could be interesting."
martialarts,3drnea,Grarvindur,3,Sun Jul 19 20:58:04 2015 UTC,"The walls currently add some interesting strategy when it comes to ground fighting and grappling. The ""bounce"" is used to setup some takedowns and fighters often use it as a way to remain standing or prevent an opponent from gaining the necessary position to establish control on the ground. They're not allowed to grab it, but pushing against it still provides leverage.  For strikers, Anthony Pettis is a great one to watch (and not just for the showtime kick). He often uses the cage to build to jumping techniques, like flying knees, that would simply be too risky if his opponent had somewhere to go.   And, as you've already noted, having a barrier helps the match stay continuous.  If you want to see what it might look like without ropes or walls, though, look up Kudo/Daido Juku competitions."
martialarts,3drnea,madmanslitany,-1,Sun Jul 19 21:25:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know it adds some strategy, I mean it's definitely impressive but I'm just not a fan of it.

martialarts,3drnea,Carlos13th,0,Mon Jul 20 17:24:13 2015 UTC,That's because it's all you've ever known. Fighters have adapted their style to the cage. They would have adapted to any fighting environment just as equally. There's no denying that having a cage is a novelty and nothing else. The fact that it's an octogon is purely marketing as well.
martialarts,3dsrd9,twitchPGMA,11,Sun Jul 19 02:35:55 2015 UTC,You pivot your foot As to get more power behind your punches. When you pivot the foot it also pivots the knee and the hips putting your whole body weight behind the punch versus just your arm.
martialarts,3dsrd9,kev_kev78,4,Sun Jul 19 02:51:38 2015 UTC,mmm i see. is that the best way to do it?
martialarts,3dsrd9,rd95,9,Sun Jul 19 03:29:08 2015 UTC,Yes. Look at quarterbacks when they throw their football. What are they doing? Putting their hip into it to get more power and distance. Look at a baseball player when they're swinging a bat. What are they doing? They're putting their hip into it for more power. The same rules apply to punching and kicking.  Hip action = Power
martialarts,3dsrd9,wisdom_possibly,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:39:27 2015 UTC,ahhh i'll probably try that out... but then why do some people choose to not pivot?
martialarts,3dsrd9,Vetty81,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:10:44 2015 UTC,"It's easier to stay stable.  Stability is good for defense in addition to the power it can give.  The Karate I was shown includes pivoting, but is considered a higher level technique so it is taught later on.  In the same way slipping is considered higher level, so blocking is the first thing taught to beginners. I've never really done Karate though so this is a bit of an outside perspective."
martialarts,3dsrd9,Arkansan13,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:36:10 2015 UTC,ahhh so Karate pivots as well? i didn't know that..
martialarts,3dsrd9,Arkansan13,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:01:23 2015 UTC,"That's funny you say that pivoting is a higher level technique.  I've always been taught it from the start.  Yes its a hard concept to grasp, but it shouldn't be taught later.  Its something that should be mastered early on."
martialarts,3dsrd9,CatMtKing,8,Sun Jul 19 22:38:36 2015 UTC,"Pivoting of the rear foot is to facilitate a transfer of weight toward the target. You see two common methods of doing this with straights, pivoting the rear foot or pushing off and up from the rear foot.   Either way it's all about throwing your weight forward with the blow. Modern boxing does this by pivoting the body around the center line thus the whirl of the shoulder, rotation of the hip, and pivoting of the foot.   In classical bare knuckle boxing for example there was much less pivot involved, the blow was power more by a snap of the arm, a rotation of the shoulder and most importantly springing off the rear foot. Compared to modern boxing the effect was more one of shifting the entire center line forward thus driving mass forward.   Neither one is inherently better I think, just different tools for different jobs. Personally I find that systems like modern Boxing in which the blow is powered by a snap rotation around the center line produces more power. However there is sort of a point where as long as you are hitting hard enough more power isn't always objectively better."
martialarts,3dsrd9,IGoodKitty,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:46:12 2015 UTC,well.. i guess that makes sense since boxers use gloves these days. padded punches require more force if you don't punch correctly (as in speed and timing applied) right?
martialarts,3dsrd9,CatMtKing,5,Sun Jul 19 05:04:24 2015 UTC,It's not so much that gloves require more force but that they protect the hands enough to allow you to throw harder.
martialarts,3dsrd9,CatMtKing,2,Sun Jul 19 05:10:21 2015 UTC,how are you telling me so much gold right now...
martialarts,3dsrd9,IGoodKitty,5,Sun Jul 19 05:11:01 2015 UTC,"Not sure where you got that idea; in taiji you do pivot the foot with the punch.  Or at least, you can if you want more force.  The further away from the contact point you align/connect, the more mechanical advantage you get.  (e.g. here is the move in the first road, fist covering hand)"
martialarts,3dsrd9,wisdom_possibly,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:33:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've learnt to pivot in both kung fu and tai chi. Especially when we do combat drills or sparring. It gets your body out of the way, and allows you to strike with more power."
martialarts,3dsrd9,mattBernius,0,Mon Jul 20 15:53:13 2015 UTC,"i was told in class that internal didnt involve the pivot. apparently, internal can still be more powerful than external. i'm guessing it's a chi thing?"
martialarts,3dsrd9,MyOwnHurricane,5,Sun Jul 19 05:00:51 2015 UTC,"That's not an adequate explanation in my opinion.  The exact details of how you want to pivot may differ from boxing (I don't know, as I never studied boxing), but I'm fairly sure that none of the principles of taiji -- as I have been taught -- prevent the foot from pivoting.  That said, it may be beneficial for beginners to avoid thinking of pivoting the foot because they will try to do it with the ankle or knee joint, neither of which should twist.  The hip joint is doing the rotating, while the knee sinks; but most people have a stiff hip joint that will not rotate enough to pivot the foot (and thus they try to compensate the movement with the knee or ankle).  Just remember that the knee should always point in the same direction as the foot.  That actually makes me think -- perhaps it's a misunderstanding of the motion of the foot pivoting?  If you are talking about the foot pivoting in relation to the shin bone, then no taiji does not do that.  But I don't think boxing does that either (or else you will roll your ankle quite easily).  If you are talking about what is essentially the leg pivoting, so the foot is turning in relation to the body, then yes taiji does do this."
martialarts,3dsrd9,imawitchbitch,0,Sun Jul 19 05:26:44 2015 UTC,"i guess i was talking about the foot pivoting in relation to the shin bone. i always felt like boxing pivots relied on toe balance, while kung fu/TC was all K1 (is that what it's called? the pressure point under your foot) balance.   it makes sense if people would mistake the ""pivoting of the leg"" with the ""pivoting of the foot"" in that sense."
martialarts,3dsrd9,lurch65,3,Sun Jul 19 06:00:39 2015 UTC,"I would double check that for boxing.  If the foot is turning in relation to the shin, then the foot and knee will misalign, causing knee or ankle pain especially if it is being used to exert force.  Not sure what the pressure point is but a key point is to avoid double heavy feet -- at least one foot should be free to rotate / not be immobilized to the ground."
martialarts,3dsrd9,Docholiday888,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:09:03 2015 UTC,"hmm thanks for pointing out the ""double heavy feet""... you just helped me realize something cool"
martialarts,3dsrd9,lerkerd00d,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:41:07 2015 UTC,"I was taught that you have three nail points on your foot: big toe, ball of your foot, heel. You will be on anywhere between 1-3 of those nail points depending on your stance, and your point in the movement.   Here is a diagram: http://4.bp.blogspot.com/__TXrAvVn3Yo/THK7FxPUlBI/AAAAAAAAAFI/H9PplYW7y2s/s1600/3nails.jpg   So, toe balance is definitely a part of tai chi too."
martialarts,3dsrd9,mattBernius,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:58:00 2015 UTC,"I study Bagua and we pivot as well.  If we want to.  It extends the technique and gives more power, but follow-up shots are slightly slower and is weaker to parry counters (ime)."

martialarts,3dsmm0,kev_kev78,5,Sun Jul 19 01:46:55 2015 UTC,"I would say that strength is a relative measure of ability gained through perseverance or hard work.   For example, someone is physically strong if they can lift ""a lot"" of weight. Someone can also be called strong if they can endure a lot of pain or discomfort. I believe that it is also correct to call someone ""a strong chess player"" or ""a strong student"".   While only my opinion, I say that ""strength is the measure of ability gained through perseverance or hard work"" so as to differentiate ability due to talent."
martialarts,3dsmm0,JohnnyKonig,5,Sun Jul 19 02:34:16 2015 UTC,I think someone is strong if they can lift heavy things for a long time without getting tired... I guess I may be one of the more down to earth martial artists...
martialarts,3dsmm0,owlbeeokay,3,Sun Jul 19 08:38:57 2015 UTC,"English doesn't work like that. Strength does not have one personal definition but a myriad of definitions.

martialarts,3ds8px,PhlipPhlops,8,Sat Jul 18 23:28:04 2015 UTC,"You've got 5 years of training and you're damn near running a school? You're also a teen. Those things both work against you as an instructor and though you may know the curriculum I don't know if you should be teaching. 5 years isn't much in any athletic endeavor but it's long enough to reach a decent level of skill. I think you should let things run their course and focus on your training. The whole arrangement sounds questionable. Sons inheriting arts has been happening for a long time, the problem is it doesn't guarantee skill or ability and has been the cause of conflict in many a system. As an early 20 something even the son's leadership ability is questionable. Also one instructor trained American street fighting karate? Sounds sketchy. Everything about this place sounds sketchy. More material is not the problem, boxing only consists of 4 or 5 punches and there's no shortage of material there. Your school sounds like a potential mcdojo, but I could be wrong. The best advice I can give is to seek out other schools and practitioners within your system and train with them, tell them your dilemma, and get their critique and feedback."
martialarts,3ds8px,Docholiday888,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:51:32 2015 UTC,"Trust me we are certainly not a mcdojo. I am the most recent black belt, and the last one before me happened about 4 years ago. We have no shortage of new students, and our testing curriculum (at least I feel) is plenty rigorous. I got my black belt faster than anyone else, mainly because I started in the kids class much older than anyone else and was able to quickly gather material and start assisting, which allowed me to train in my leadership skills much faster than anyone else was able to at the time. More often it takes between 7-9 years to achieve.   I think you should let things run their course and focus on your training.   I understand what you're saying, but I can't leave my position as an instructor because there is no one to replace me. I go in and solo train before classes ever day to keep myself physically active, but that can't really sharpen technique.  Not quite sure what you mean by other schools within my system. My school isn't a chain, if I'm gathering that correctly. We used to have a second school a few miles away long before I started, but had a dispute with the landlord and solidified into one. What I have is all there is. In fact, I believe we are the only Kenpo school within a reasonable range.   Also one instructor trained American street fighting karate   Self-proclaimed. He did Navy Boxing and had been training under Master Quinn for over 14 years before he died. What he calls Street Fighting is his interpretation of practical self-defense. Sorry I could've worded that much better."
martialarts,3ds8px,Docholiday888,4,Sun Jul 19 00:10:08 2015 UTC,"You're welcome to link your schools webpage. Your place may not be a mcdojo but you are probably the last person who can make that call. If you were raised training in that school you probably wouldn't realize it. I rigorous black belt test isn't indicative of good training.ive known schools that have pretty grueling bb tests that are otherwise pretty mediocre. Regular sparring is important, bit even moreso is sparring with an instructor that has experience fighting or competing. As far as other schools within your system I mean this; your style descends from Ed Parker, find another Ed Parker school and see what they have and what advice they offer. You may not be part of a franchise or may not have more schools within your system but you need to be exposed to other ways of thinking and ways of interpreting the art. If you like what you do seek out others within kenpo and train with them to gain more knoweldge and understanding. If there's no one local then travel, try out different schools. I don't think you can ever gain a truly deep understanding of an art training in the same school, branch out. I'm personally not a fan of kenpo but I do have friends who I respect that have told me there are solid kenpo guys out there. I just see a prevalence of kenpo guys that train over complicated combinations of moves with little emphasis on resistance training and an over abundance of moves and techniques. Kenpo has kicking, punching, knees and elbows, it also has throws and joint locks, why not go to an art that specializes in striking or joint locks and throws and refine your technique. If you feel like you've seen all your system has to offer and lack material you're not training with the right mentality. Supplement your skill with specialized training or seek out other kenpo schools and see how they apply the art. But also be upfront and explain your dilemma, keep an open mind. Taking stuff from the Internet and teaching it in class is a bad idea. You should have plenty to work on as it is. The same goes for training with other schools, you should be looking to improve yourself. Don't worry about taking things back to your school, you need to reach an advanced level in the school you're training and the instructirs approval before you can share and teach what you learn, keep it honest."

Looks like you might have some filipino martial arts training, you could always explore that aspect of your training some more. I know some FMA guys out there."
martialarts,3ds8px,Carlos13th,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:08:34 2015 UTC,"Master Quinn spent a lot of time in the Philippines training. I'm not quite sure how much was passed down to me besides the Arnis fighting we do.  I think those were just advertisement buzzwords to get in more students. The website was handled by a parent rather than Master Quinn himself. But the ex-Navy who has been here for almost two decades at this point said that we used to be a fighting school. Attended every single Atlanta-based tournament. I've seen the trophies on his wall, they are impressive. But we lost that identity a while ago. We go to the Battle of Atlanta every year, but we attend as volunteers mostly just to show our younger students what some fantastic martial artists are capable of. It does wonders to gather focus in class, at least.  At the moment I guess you interpretation is a bit more accurate. I don't have the strict disciplinary attitude when teaching class that tends to insight focus or drive to fight. I guess I've drifted to the side of ""self-defense,"" using sparring as more of practice than training, if that makes sense.  Honestly that is what the original post is about. I can teach what I know, but there are things that I am missing that I want to learn how to teach. Things that are important.

You cant spend all your time where you currently are without going elsewhere for training then complain that you don't know how to teach them.   The time in the dojo on your own before class wont cut it either. You need to seek out qualified instruction.   If you do this though don't be expecting to bring back material right away.

Basically we don't harass students for payment, we just hope the parents are skimming us, which I'm certain some might be. I want to say we have somewhere around 40 total students between the kids and adult classes. I do not know the details on the building's ownership.  My father and I are already well trusted. I have the keys to the building and he handles the money when students pay their monthly or want to buy gear for sparring or whatever.

The environment was always changing. Once there was a large dumpster blocking most the alley and we were told to ""adapt"" or drills to account for it. I discovered that disarming a knife attack can be greatly facilitated by redirecting the stab into a solid flat surface (e.g. the side of the dumpster) and that restriction lends itself to defense more than attack. However it does mean you must make escape a high priority as it is not necessarily a simple matter of running away.  Training for every environmental variable is impossible, but diversifying your training environment can make you more flexible in dealing with the unforeseen. This is an excellent subject and one I wish was brought more often to bear in self-defense training."

martialarts,3dqkde,MacintoshEddie,2,Sun Jul 19 00:57:29 2015 UTC,"We frequently make use of the environment.  Either the instructor will throw  some small pads in as ""bricks"", or we use the existing things in the area such as the support pillars in the middle of the room.  It's always fun to see people's faces when they realize that while fighting near the pillar, if you get ahold of the opponents arms thrusting them around the pillar is a very effective technique.  Not many people are strong enough to resist that, and it's quite painful to get the corner of the pillar right in the elbow.  Other times we fight outside the gym, Rory Miller loves his stair fighting and bathroom fighting.  You haven't lived until you've brawled in a bathroom stall, looked the other guy in the eye and said, ""If you shove me into the urinal I will burn down your house."".  Paper towel and soap dispensers, hand dryers, countertops, etc.  They can all do trendous influences on your options.  Getting trapped in a doorway also sucks.  Stair fighting in particular changes so much stuff.  So many edges, so many opportunities to lose your balance.  We normally have at least 3 safety people when we play on the stairs.  Pro tip, things get crazy on tile stairs, breakfalls don't work, all the dynamics change.  If you ever get attacked by a grappler on stairs just run.  Run forever."
martialarts,3dovu9,darthturtle3,3,Sat Jul 18 01:19:45 2015 UTC,It seems like the alehouse dagger advantage is mostly about range. So are we basically just seeing the reason why rapier-type swords became popular for duals in Europe?

martialarts,3dovu9,KlutchAtStraws,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:47:35 2015 UTC,Isn't that why samurai carried the wakizashi?  The katana was generally too long for indoor use but in case they had to have something to hand to fight with indoors they could use the short sword.
martialarts,3dovu9,ithika,3,Mon Jul 20 18:14:31 2015 UTC,The fast evolution of fighting styles in the second match was fascinating to watch. Short-dagger quickly evolved to lunge with his free hand to bind up the other guy's weapon hand. That worked about three times before Long-dagger got wise to it and started brutally smacking the incoming hand.

martialarts,3do7ol,HandsomeOwl,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:58:57 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of very good and very bad books on this and very few good documentaries. Regardless, if you're really serious about the subject you should start by reading the famous historical texts. The Go Rin No Sho (Book of Five Rings) by the samurai Musashi Miyamoto is basically the budo bible. Though principally focused on swordsmanship, it has lessons and principles applicable well beyond that. It's not long, but it's a work you will come back to over and over again. It's an absolute must read. Also, a short work of his called the Dokkodo (The Path of Aloneness) is worth seeking out. There is also the Hagakure by the samurai Yamamoto Tsunetomo, which is THE historical text on bushido, the way of the warrior. It's essentially a collection of his opinions on how a samurai must live and end their life. Then there is the Unfettered Mind by the Rinzai monk Takuan Soho. It's a collection of three essays written for the samurai Yagyu Munenori concerning the application of zen buddhism to martial arts. It's probably the hardest to read due to its subject matter, but not long. Definitely a work to revisit frequently.  There are a lot of differences between translations, so it's worth finding different versions to compare. I recommend starting with  William Scott Wilson's translations as they have a good reputation and are easy to find online."
martialarts,3do7ol,lestroarmonico,4,Sat Jul 18 08:18:12 2015 UTC,"Worth noting that the Hagakure and the idea of Bushido that it represents only gained massive popularity during the Edo period, one of the longest periods of peace in Japanese history, in a time where the samurai had no more wars to fight, and many subsequently became bureaucrats, or took up other trades.    Of course, many of the surviving koryu styles of Japanese martial arts was developed during the Edo period, and many budo arts were developed after the Meiji Restoration, after the end of the Tokugawa Shogunate.    What I'm trying to say is that the Hagakure may have influenced many of the Japanese martial arts as we know it, but its ideas were developed after the height of samurai warfare, and were probably not as central to the samurai as we might think."
martialarts,3do7ol,darthturtle3,3,Sat Jul 18 10:15:08 2015 UTC,Pretty much what I was going to say. People treat Hagakure as if it was a book written by a Samurai during the Sengoku Jidai instead of by an bureaucrat who I believe had never seen battle trying to work out a place for a warrior class without wars while seemingly romanticizing the Samurai that came before.
martialarts,3do7ol,Carlos13th,3,Sat Jul 18 10:48:36 2015 UTC,"That was kinda what led to the idea of Bushido, I think.    How does a warrior caste stay true to its identity when their raison d'Ãªtre is no longer relevant?    By creating a sub-culture that idealises their warrior past, with the belief that by keeping to a warrior code (which never existed among the ""warriors"" this code was supposed to represent), they keep their ""warrior spirit"", even if they can't fight in wars anymore.    This allows the samurai to keep thinking of themselves as warriors, in a society that no longer need a warrior caste."
martialarts,3do7ol,darthturtle3,2,Sat Jul 18 11:12:28 2015 UTC,Sounds about right to me.   You seem similar things happening in martial arts classes too. Romanticizing the people that came before often to the point of near ancestor worship and the idea to be a martial artist you have to follow a code of some kind that is often completely removed and unrelated to the activity in question which I suppose is meant to replace the fact you are rarely actually applying the stuff you are training to do.

I would question how well those kind of head guards actually prevent brain damage.   Now maybe they cant hit hard enough to risk that concussion and minor TBI's, maybe they are a high enough risk due to their developing brains that the lower level of power can still have a potential for brain damage."
martialarts,3dkd79,Grarvindur,4,Fri Jul 17 04:01:18 2015 UTC,This is pretty close to correct. Most concussions actually occur through falling and are unrelated to helmets. Essentially your brain moves inside of your cerebrum and slams into the inner walls. Its like slamming on the breaks in your car. Any fast motion with a sudden stop yield potential for a concussion.

martialarts,3di7pl,Apollo78,0,Thu Jul 16 18:24:09 2015 UTC,"I think it is the marketing difference between UFC/Bellator and things like K1, boxing, and even pride back in the day.  The marketing of UFC is geared toward people who want to get drunk and watch people beat each other up.   And in America, that shallowness is acceptable, but as anyone can see, it is not sustainable."
martialarts,3di7pl,KingThallion,6,Thu Jul 16 17:31:28 2015 UTC,"I understand where you're going, but I think that kind of focus belies universal realities of prize fighting. People got very disappointed by a recent technically excellent boxing PPV fight due to a lack of action. Consumers of these sports want knockouts and action regardless of how the promoter dresses it up. Pride built it's marketing on nationalism and squash matches and featured some of the most brutal fights we've seen. Boxings history is littered with broken bodies and shattered minds. You can dress up prize fighting violence in faux respectability, but Muhammad Ali can't speak clearly and no platitudes will change that. You may think it's not sustainable, but there is a lot of history against you. I appreciate UFC for not mincing words or reality on this front. It may be shallow or barbaric but at least it's honest.   Even if you disagree with the above points the distinction doesn't really fly with Rickson whose brothers built the UFC into what it is and when he himself participated in countless vale tudo fights. He was around for that early barbarism and he is either looking back with rose colored glasses or willingly denying how rough the sport has always been. It was sold as no holds barred tough man fighting and he profited. I also find his observations about the technical focus of MMA to be plain wrong."

""gjj will make you a better person""  now, isn't that what all the TKD schools were saying in the 90s when rickson and his family exploded on the scene?"

I think that through challenging different martial arts gyms who may have very little to zero ground game or takedown defense, they could win very easily.  Even though it would've turned out all differently if their opponents had any experience with not getting taken down and destroyed once they're there, it made BJJ out to be the superior and best thing.   Today we know you can't go into MMA and win with just BJJ (or just anything really), but before the concept of cross-training came into existance they could keep using this strategy to market themselves.  And now when MMA has shifted away from BJJ, they'll say that MMA is terrible and aweful people - and everyone should only do BJJ because it's spiritual and a religion and yadayada.  Profits, profits. That said, I don't particularly like MMA and definitely dislike the culture and mindset I see in a lot of these competitors, aswell as fans."
martialarts,3di7pl,Grarvindur,3,Thu Jul 16 17:39:01 2015 UTC,truthfully i think that's BJJ's biggest contribution - they've shown everyone that there IS NO magic bullet and being able to use both striking and grappling skills is good  MMA fans?  personally i think a sports' fans are to be disregarded.    look at the NFL - on monday morning everyone is an expert quarterback and coach  if anyone is responsible now for the mma culture/mindset its the UFC (which can be argued to be a part Gracie creation).

My opinion on the NFL is kind of the same, just like Ice Hockey etc. But I guess the difference is that many of the fans are cheering for the blood and not the technical skill etc. I think a lot of the fighters' attitudes are a disgrace and don't behave like sporting athletes. Now this isn't unique to MMA but it really stands out compared to a lot of other things.  I also don't like the Octagon, I think it strengthens this bloodlust because from a viewers perspective it's like caged animals fighting. Just my own theory though.  And yeah when I hear ""MMA"" I immediatly think about UFC, not much else. I've probably seen a fight or so from Bellator and Strikeforce but that's it for non-UFC organizations."

People cross train and understand the basics required to be well rounded.  When Royce was dominating opponents it made BJJ looks like the dominant martial art.  What's happened now is that people have learned it and understand the even if you're not a BJJ black belt or expert you can learn basic escapes or good takedown defense and still be very effective in MMA.

MMA is not underground anymore; we have UFC fighters appearing on Wheaties boxes. It's a different world than the one he fought in.

martialarts,3di7pl,slightlyoffki,-6,Thu Jul 16 16:14:25 2015 UTC,"The UFC sets a bad example. MMA is conceptual, it's just the idea of an open rule set for multiple martial arts."
martialarts,3di7pl,Apollo78,6,Thu Jul 16 18:21:44 2015 UTC,"I think he's referring to the concept of mixed martial arts, however, and not just the UFC.   I feel that MMA has moved away from what I believe is the purpose of going to a gym to train. I think thereâs a philosophy behind martial arts, which should go along with training and go hand in hand with a fighterâs routine. Nowadays, the first principle is that there is no philosophy. Itâs about cross training. Youâve got to cross train to be able to fight, kick, and hit. Every rule draws you to an extreme sport without a code. Itâs about the individual. Nobodyâs measuring anyoneâs technical potential anymore. Theyâre measuring explosion, force, speed, the ability to withstand impact, toughness.  In my opinion, thatâs something that downgrades the image of martial arts [..]  I have no interest at all in martial arts being mixed, this thing without any doctrine or concept   He even stated that for him it's essentially religious; the purity of the single art, and having a doctrine, and having respect for your opponent, and peace, and all of it.  I'm not trying to say you're wrong, because there are things he said that sound like he's criticizing specific competitions, but I do think that he's criticizing MMA as a concept, and not just UFC.  Also, I don't think you deserve downvotes for your opinion on it."
martialarts,3di7pl,stultus_respectant,7,Thu Jul 16 18:58:49 2015 UTC,This especially hilarious since those same things are characteristics that the gracies criticized in trad arts when they started pioneering BJJ.
martialarts,3di7pl,Kintanon,3,Thu Jul 16 20:15:51 2015 UTC,"Also, I don't think you deserve downvotes for your opinion on it.   First, I really appreciate that. I've always thought one of the best qualities someone can cultivate is the ability to disagree respectfully.  As for what I said, I'm basically getting at the fact that for so many people the UFC and MMA are the same thing and that it's perfectly understandable for that to leave a bad taste in your mouth over MMA as a whole. IMO the UFC, despite having undeniably some of the best talent in combat sports, is pretty well just as much about the gladiatorial shit that Rickson is saying it is, but ultimately his negative ideas about cross training and the concept of MMA are the unfair parts. I think it's fair to say that MMA has little in the way of moral code, but I don't think that leaves people without codes of their own. I get that he seems to want the older sort of idea where a singular art brings with it an honor code and to be honest I personally try (not always suceeding) to live by some of the more universal morals that BJJ is/was supposedly packaged with, but amongst those are humility and adaptability. Both of which I feel like I'm seeing less from the Gracie's nowadays, so I now feel like that falls onto me as an individual and really I feel like it's going to go that way for others as well in the future. I actually used to be really into Zen and such, which I'd call a similar worldview, and to be honest this highlights one of the reasons why that's no longer the case. It's incredibly hard to say ""such and such is wrong"" or ""what I'm doing is right"" without directing it back to yourself as positive example and letting ego seep into the discussion from there and I fear this the trap they've fallen into.  TLDR/Edit if I missed anything; UFC, pretty bad example in terms of morality because of how much ego the pump into the fights, but I don't think that's inherent to the concept of MMA. In theory we could have a system or rule set we'd consider MMA, but under any worldview or honor code imaginable. While I respect what the Gracie's stand for, I don't feel it's as sincere as it should be and I don't think practicing a singular art is the only way to practice martial arts with those or similar values. You could be a boxer who's very rooted in Zen, but to be fair that'd be squarely on you to uphold those values since your training partners wouldn't be holding you to it."

You chased him outside. The threat to your girlfriend was neutralized. Beating your chest and trying to take on a guy with a knife while he's trying to run away fromyou was just going to get you injured to some degree of severity. That's not defending your family. The best way you can defend your family is by keeping yourself alive and in one piece. I know it sucks. If I were in your position I'd be kicking myself, and having wet dreams about teaching him a lesson. But that's servicing your ego, not your family. Self defense is about keeping yourself and your family safe. Period.   That said, I encourage any man or woman to learn a martial art. Muay Thai is a great choice for striking, and learn some BJJ / Judo / Sambo in case it goes to the ground. Krav Maga training is great, but as people always point out in the sub, it lacks quality control, and you're better off cross training in it after you have some solid MA experience under yr belt.

martialarts,3dly41,PsychoticTwiddle,4,Sun Jul 19 13:11:04 2015 UTC,"First off buddy, read a book by Rory Miller - meditations on violence.    It is understandable that it is killing you because in your eyes you have not been able to do the whole protection thing... but he had a knife and thank god you did not engage. Even with a very skilled a talented martial artist knives are tricky because if you get knicked your fucked. There is a scene in Fight Quest (I believe) where they are knife sparring with lipstick on the fake knives to show cuts... they go at it for a couple minutes and pretty much everywhere is cut. I.E. you are dead. So you did the right thing in not engaging.   In saying that, I think a good place to start would be boxing and muay thai. Boxing is not given enough credit, but is phenomenal. Muay thai is good for some basic kicks. Once you are well versed in those I would suggest that you look for classes that are taught by a genuine teacher in street fighting as street fighting will always be different then in the ring. Oh and also look into grappling, that is essential.  I have a back ground in Kung FU and I am now doing another art that was created by my instructor, aimed at the street. He gets heavy influences from Bruce Lee/Dan Inosanto/ Silat and Kali. When or if you decide to go to this stage make sure you are pressure tested at every level other wise you will have a false sense in what you can do.

If there is a Krav Maga school in your area though, it wouldn't hurt to go and ask some questions. They seem to focus a lot on disarming weapons, which is something not practiced in boxing, Muay Thai etc.   I have some experience in Muay Thai and i have managed to retain knowledge and capabilities in performing the moves, despite not training in some time. As Grarvindur suggested, the muscle memory will be there, you would just have to watch your flexibility. Muay Thai has an advantage in that it uses more than just punches and kicks too. You will also be learning clinches, elbows and knees, which give you more options in problematic situations.  Boxing and Muay Thai will give you a great stand-up game, but they won't help you when you come up against someone wielding a weapon or fighting on the ground. Brazilian Jujitsu will give you one of the best ground games. Krav Maga will give you a bit of everything, as far as i can tell.  Overall, i think it just comes down to having to visit individual gyms and see how they teach and how good they are."
martialarts,3dly41,SSAUS,2,Fri Jul 17 10:55:07 2015 UTC,"This is a good starting point if you want to know more about Krav Maga https://www.reddit.com/r/kravmaga/wiki/faq  Now, about what happened to you, you did the right thing in letting him go and getting scared is completely normal in that situation. Now if he had been cornered with a knife in your house, Krav Maga  would have taught you to either 1) Figure out a way to leave him an opening to escape that did not put your loved ones in his path. 2) Flee or hide with your loved ones while calling 911 Or 3) If those were not an option, use a common object from your house to protect yourself as aggressively, mercilessly and quickly as possible.  There is no martial art that will prepare you 100% to overcome an agressor wielding a knife, in addition to your training its all about degrees of success depending on factors outside of your control (location, mental disposition of the assailant, number of assailants and so on), but a likely outcome if you get in that fight is that you will get more or less cut/stabbed. The idea in Krav maga is to get as far as possible on the less side.  Another thing that a good Krav Maga school will attempt to teach you is to function in high degrees of stress and surprise by doing technique and awareness exercises while deathly tired. This also trains you to never give up, and keep going instead of just accepting your fate.  Now, it does not fully prepare you for an adrenaline dump, but it does get some of the way. For the full adrenaline challenge you would need to be stuck in a cage with chained dogs intent on killing but restrained just out of reach while trying to solve problems or target practice, as they train in Gavin de Becker & Associates."

It all depends on the person and how much time you put down on training every week, but if you're talented, hardworking or both I'd say that it's possible to learn all the basic techniques correctly more or less - aswell as get some understanding of tactics and strategy in a fight(what works, what doesn't work).   All martial arts people who have been in fights will probably agree with me when I say that untrained people are seriously awful at fighting and almost any amount of training in any martial art(almost any) is  enough.  Most MT places won't put you in sparring until after a few months of basic training, and sparring is really the key to learning it.   From my experience Boxing places tend to put you in light sparring a lot earlier, but then again Boxing is not as well-rounded training.   MT teaches you what to do if you clinch, to use your legs, elbows, knees and hands. Boxing is using your hands (and kind of legs for foot work ofcourse)."
martialarts,3dly41,plump_assassin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:01:17 2015 UTC,MT looks incredibly convenient. I really loved it. This may sound really childish but is there a difference in punches with MT and Boxing?  I've seen some brawls where boxers just kos people in a second. Fast and effective. It seems MT depends on kicks for KOs. Yet again I don't know much about it.  The problem is I can't see myself doing a spear knee move. I'm really not that flexible. But I've never did any flexing training either.
martialarts,3dly41,Carlos13th,2,Fri Jul 17 11:15:08 2015 UTC,"As the other guy said, since there is a smaller emphasis on punching in MT than Boxing, a boxer will on average be much more proficient. You can crosstrain if you want to improve your punches more, like I train TKD to be better than the others with my legs.  The techniques in themselves are the same though. MT used to have a lackluster punching game but decided to completely adopt Boxing for their hand techniques, so regardless of where you go your hand techniques are the same.   Start stretching some and I bet that you'll do all those things you think you can't do in no time."
martialarts,3dly41,MartialArtEnthusiast,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:35:45 2015 UTC,"If you do Muay Thai, you will learn to flex naturally anyway.   Punches in both serve different functions, and they will most likely be better in boxing than what they are in Muay Thai. I was taught that punches are mostly used to set up other moves in Muay Thai, whereas in boxing they are the main weapons and are used for many things.  It depends on what you want, but it wouldn't hurt to take both arts. You will learn better punching in boxing, but better overall striking offence in Muay Thai (with the utilisation of the 8 limbs)."
martialarts,3dly41,Carlos13th,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:23:53 2015 UTC,I love that 1 punch KOs but I think I love MT. At the moment my financial status wouldn't allow me to take both classes.  I would love to learn those devastating punches but MT looks more fun. I'm just stuck in this. :)   My heart wants MT i guess.
martialarts,3dly41,owlbeeokay,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:43:25 2015 UTC,I've read some comments about MT and Boxing can not be practiced together. Because they have different foot plays etc. Is that true ?
martialarts,3dly41,M3atboy,3,Fri Jul 17 11:47:55 2015 UTC,"It's not that simple.  In MT, you are allowed to strike nearly anywhere ( I think only the groin and the back of the head off-limits) with hands, legs, knees, or elbows. You are allowed to clinch and do some very limited grappling.  In boxing, you are only allowed to hit your opponent's front torso and head, and only with your knuckles. If you clinch, you are quickly ordered to break by the ref.  I trained both arts at various times, but I ultimately picked boxing over MT, mostly because I enjoyed it more.  The different rule sets have the effect of creating different fighters. MT fighters tend to stand in a stiff upright posture and square up to the opponent, because that allows better defense from leg kicks. In MT, you are pretty much guaranteed to take hits somewhere. If you move too much to avoid punches, you will leave yourself open to kicks or knees.  In boxing, punches are your only threat. Therefore, boxers can use a more intrincate footwork, and they can bend at the waist. A boxer learns to use head movement to become a harder target, to bob, slip and weave, and to throw more elaborate combinations. Boxers are of course much better punchers than Muay Thai fighters, because they devote a lot more time to punching.  In a one vs. one fight, the MT guy destroys a boxer. But I would argue that boxing is more directly applicable to self defense. After all, most streetfights involve lots of clumsy head punches, and nothing teaches you how to deal with those better than boxing.   In any case, both boxer and nak muay are probably fucked if they run into a grappler. If you care about self defense, don't neglect grappling."
martialarts,3dly41,darthturtle3,2,Fri Jul 17 17:17:15 2015 UTC,"Any punch, if done right, could cause serious injury or knock out an opponent. You wouldn't have to learn boxing to throw an adequate punch with enough power. You should learn pretty good punching techniques in Muay Thai. As Grarvindur said, most Muay Thai gyms borrowed boxing's punches anyway.   Boxing and Muay Thai have different footwork and techniques, which could make cross-training difficult. It isn't impossible however. John Wayne Parr is a good example of this...he has trained in both and utilises excellent boxing in his Muay Thai.  Out of the two, i would suggest Muay Thai, as you will be learning punches as well as elbows, knees, kicks and the clinch."
martialarts,3dly41,M3atboy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:11:16 2015 UTC,"Most definitely. 6 months training in either will give you a very solid framework from which to work. Obviously, it depends on you and your ability to learn, but the basics should be easy to pick up. In the very least, you will learn more practical applications in these arts in the same time period when compared to others."

Hadaka Jime would be more plausible in that case. The purpose of these videos is to show and explain what technique is being done within each scene from a judo/jujutsu perspective (I use reference materials such as Jigoro Kano's book). Its a tip-of-the-hat for the media art's use of these techniques, and an FYI for those that are curious as to what technique is being done in the scenes. In the end, its still a video game, and what is shown on t.v. or video games seldom go hand-in-hand with reality. For example, in the Batman Arkham games, Batman launches a bad guy in the air with Kata guruma and then kicks him in the spine as hes about to hit the ground. Realistic? kind of a no-brainer on the answer, but its still freakin cool and bad ass! Also, some of the techniques are practical in a real-life scenario, just not in the grandiose execution as shown in media and in certain context."

Especially if we start off with a boxing base, learning the angles to engage on (and making them intuitive), the experience of getting hit (and if you think you know, go to a boxing gym and ask to spar). Most people in MMA would get fucking handled in a boxing gym. Take the time to learn the skill.  Sequeing into contact, the use of the clinch not solely as a striking platform, but also as the transition into body control. Real wrestling, especially Greco, makes a lot of sense from stand-up. Move into folk takedowns and catch, and it becomes a little less useful in the setting of a street fight.  The concerns in an assault are different than those of sportsâbut the fundamental building blocks are no different. Pretending to shortcut those makes for a whole bunch of bullshit SD classes where you can ""fight"" because you punched at someone wearing gloves. You're deluding yourself.  ""Fighting for your life"" doesn't require the assailant to acknowledge your pantomime.

Personally, I do think some of the lack comes from the fact that you do have to dedicate time to and account for takedowns and grappling and that a lot of boxers would own in the boxing gym, but wouldn't necessarily beat them in the cage. That said, there is room for improvement in striking I'm sure, so I've always wondered why more solid boxers don't seem to go into MMA."

You'll also get realistic senses of timing and of our own vulnerabilities. The whole experience fosters development much faster than experiences in less scientific methods of fighting.   I've been attacked by 2, 3, and 4 people. Basic boxing and wrestling got me through all of those attacks. Boxing for the quick hits and mobility, wrestling to keep from getting controlled, and both for defense and reading body movement. What applies to one human applies to another, so all I did was apply that knowledge on the spot in those situations. I'm only human, so if I can do it then anyone else can."

I see your point about wrestling, especially as takedown defense goes which would be very valuable.  Also, the footwork and ""stick and move"" of boxing would be great tactically.  I currently do Muay Thai boxing and I wish I had done it back then.  While I understand that the McKwoon/McDojo world of TMAs don't spar/wont spar, underneath that there is a culture that is very ""fight club-ey"" in TMAs.

Violence that involves weapons and/or multiple attackers is the scariest kind. Also, I'm just not afraid of a single unarmed attacker. Maybe I should be, but I'm really not.

Same thing with knife defense. Even if the plan is to stay at a safe distance and find a way to not engage, it's still a plan. If someone suggests a strategy that doesn't make sense to you, don't use it and keep searching until you find one that does.  Edit: I don't think an art that only focuses on fighting multiple people is a disadvantage if in a 1v1 situation. If you adapt it to fighting in 1v1 scenarios you'll be just as effective as a person that only trained in a 1v1 art that adapts it to fighting vs multiple attackers."

To argue that this is representative for anything isn't fair."
martialarts,3djry4,KennethGloeckler,6,Fri Jul 17 05:10:09 2015 UTC,"FYI, if it is a black belt test those are usually 8+ hours long, depending on the school it may be multiple days.  I'm not saying that one was, or that that was a good school, or any of that. Just saying that someone looking like crap during the test doesn't mean much. You don't get to even take the test if your skills aren't presumably good enough.  I did a yellow belt (P1 equivalent) test after one year of krav, it was 5 hours. My sparring technique during the 5th hour was horrible. My hands wouldn't stay up. My attacks were weak. I could barely check anything. And that was just against one person! If there had been video it would be so much worse than the one you linked. Absolutely laughable. The point at that point is not about technique anymore. It is to just keep moving, keep fighting, never give up.  Again, no idea about the video linked above, just some perspective."
martialarts,3djry4,demosthenes83,2,Fri Jul 17 05:36:08 2015 UTC,Yup! I can totally see that context like this will get lost in a short youtube clip. Why they would then choose to upload this is a completely different question.   The sort of stress test has its place of course. Not for grading purposes but I am sure you have some new insights because of it? It just makes a lot of sense that you know how bad you are at your worst.
martialarts,3djry4,KennethGloeckler,3,Fri Jul 17 05:47:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no idea why it would get uploaded.  In terms of why they have us spar at that point... I can't say for all schools (I only attended one krav school), but the main purpose was to push people past their mental blocks.  If you got into a fight (and of course, hopefully you avoided it), but if you got into it there was to be no giving up. No quitting. No surrender. You go all out until you can't move anymore, and then you keep going. If you're defending your life when you quit you die.  That focus on never giving up and the ability to 'flip the switch' (turn on full out aggression) are two of the things that good krav does well and that I don't see much of in other systems.  That said, transitioning from Krav to BJJ has been really tricky as it was hard to switch to a gentler, more playful sort of style with no aggression."

Against an untrained opponent that burst may be OK, but arts like BJJ value conservation of energy.   When I've rolled wth new BJJ students who have done Krav all I have to do is take top position and wait.  After about a minute or two their gas tank is empty from thrashing around and I can have my way with them."

The idea being that if your life depends on it, you better find some wherewithal somewhere even if it means mortgaging some of your soul to find the energy."
martialarts,3djry4,gabrielsburg,2,Fri Jul 17 15:24:41 2015 UTC,"Well considering this is one school and I've never heard of krav giving out 'black belts' I would dare say this isn't the best representation.  KM has mcdojos just like any art. People looking to make a quick buck because they can say some flashy stuff about self defense.  As I understand it, defense against multiple attackers is less trying to actually engage them and more trying to keep them away long enough to break contact and run/draw your weapon if necessary.   I never said you shouldn't train to deal with people 1v1, you definitely need those skills to scale it up to multiples. But to pretend that fighting 1v1 means you're perfectly prepared for 1 v many is no different from saying fighting 1 v many prepares you for 1v1.  But I mean sure if you want to misrepresent everything then I guess this video is be-all end-all proof."

martialarts,3djry4,ithika,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:44:39 2015 UTC,"For me at least, dealing with multiple attackers and with knives is humbling.  There are certainly technical things you can employ and strategies that can help you deal with these things, but the reality is if you go up against a trained knife fighter unarmed you're going to get cut.  If you go fighting three guys that have had any kind of martial arts training you're going to have a really rough time as well.  So while I think you should still train for those worst case scenarios I think the bigger lesson is to instill upon students that even an excellent martial artist should run away from the crazy dude coming at you with a knife unless there's no other choice.    When I did FMA my instructor brought in some washable markers one day and said we're going to be doing some light sparing with these and we took turns using our best knife defense to protect ourselves.  Everyone had rainbow markings on them by the end of that lesson.  Knife defense and multiple attacker scenarios really emphasize the idea that even with the best training there are still things out there that will steamroll you.  Not everyone gets that, but hopefully some of those students will learn from that and take it to heart."

That said, Kyokushin is pressure-tested, so it's relatively easy to find a good school as compared to a less competitive form of martial arts. I can vouch for what I've seen of the organization in videos my instructor took at the Honbu (the Kaicho's son was absolutely incredible to watch spar), but the best thing you can do is check the individual school yourself.  And, actually, I'm a white belt. My black belt is in Taekwondo; the training at the Honbu is an opportunity for any and all IKU members who are interested."

martialarts,3dl8h0,McGracieJiujitsu,7,Fri Jul 17 04:24:56 2015 UTC,"Many places make most of their money from kids. It's essentially a glorified daycare.  Even really good places, with good adult competitors may depend on kids classes to keep the lights on and the doors open.  So yes, if you look at all the schools in the US across all arts-most of them are going to be kid focused. Adult focused ones definitely exist, but they are rarer, and are easier to find in systems with a more active competition scene.  As long as a school treats its adults seriously, and there are separate adult classes there's no reason a school with a lot of kid classes can't be a good fit for an adult. If your best sparring partners are mostly under 15, that's a huge problem."
martialarts,3dl8h0,demosthenes83,2,Fri Jul 17 05:26:26 2015 UTC,"I agree.  The instructors I've studied under and the school I teach for make most of their money from kids.   My experience is that teaching kids allows you to pay the bills.  Without teaching kids, it's very hard to make anything beyond a hobby income from martial arts.  With kids you can more easily afford your own space.  I've seen a few programs that cater exclusively to adults.  For the most part, those are taught by people with full-time jobs in other industries.  If someone is doing a martial art full time without teaching kids they tend to cater to the hard-hitting crowd: MMA, boxing, or similar."
martialarts,3dl8h0,embusen,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:45:23 2015 UTC,I used to do Kyokushin and the brown and black belts that were there all the time were like 14 years old every once in a while we got older black belts. Do you think that was a huge problem?
martialarts,3dl8h0,embusen,3,Fri Jul 17 21:16:35 2015 UTC,"Eh, I get worried when I see black belts under 16 years old.  I think there's a certain maturity & choice that should accompany a black belt.  I have seen one 14 year old black belt, who later went on to earn their living during early adulthood competing.    That person was the exception, not the rule.  All the other folks I know earned their belts as adults with 5-10 years of experience or teens with around a decade of practice."
martialarts,3dl8h0,NfinityPlusOne,3,Sat Jul 18 03:39:25 2015 UTC,"I think it's more evident in certain martial arts than others.  For instance, I doubt there are too many Krav schools that cater to kids. * ""OK boys and girls, today we're going to practice gun disarms!""*  Taekwondo and Karate though really depend on it.  They basically started the business model for martial arts schools catering to kids.  TKD especially so.  From a business perspective, it's incredibly smart.  After-school childcare is expensive.  Often these schools have a bus or large van and pick kids up from school, drive them to the dojang, feed them a snack, and then teach a class.  All for cheaper than the price of traditional after-school childcare.  It's quite tempting for many parents, I'm sure, even if their kid doesn't like the martial art in the least.  These days you do see more MMA schools offering kids classes.  It's just better for business to include a wider variety of customers, not just limiting yourself to 18-35 year old males.  I know some very high calibre karateka who are full time instructors who do karate birthday parties for children.  As an instructor myself, I'd never want to do that as I'd feel like I'm selling out, but I totally get it.  They have permanent training studios and bills to pay and families to feed.  I can respect that.  Another thing I've noticed is that martial arts schools who only teach adults often have to charge MUCH higher tuition.  There's a few MMA and BJJ schools in my city that charge the same price for one adult as some other family-friendly schools do for a family of 3.  When schools teach kids, typically the costs are lower for everyone, and that's a win-win in my book.  In the end, it's a necessary ""evil"".  And it's really only a problem if it affects the quality of instruction or the quality of the students.  If you've got a fantastic instructor with very technical and capable students, it really shouldn't matter if he caters to children too."

My tai chi and bagua teacher didn't teach kids but it was more expensive, also the guy taught all day, like 8 hours a day and then some more at night as well as weekend stuff.  My Wing Chun school also didn't have any kids, except for three or four quite developed teens."
martialarts,3dl8h0,the_red_scimitar,2,Mon Jul 20 01:16:39 2015 UTC,I also feel it's sometimes evident in their schedules. If adult classes don't start until 8:30pm you can probably bet that the owner is banking on kids for his school.
martialarts,3dl8h0,the_red_scimitar,2,Fri Jul 17 13:57:54 2015 UTC,"""Martial Arts"" doesn't actually cater... at all... to anything. There is no codified thing called ""martial arts"".  Some organizations and dojos, as individual businesses, DO promote heavily to parents, particularly for after school programs.  Each place is different. I've not found a child-centric training organization to be very good for serious adult training. Look for a gym producing excellent practitioners. Don't bother looking at the teachers until you've determined the students who've learned from them are any good."

For example, if you are interested in a relaxed atmosphere that encourages socializing, then something like bjj is definitely gonna be more promising. I drank tea with my kung fu master before but I can't ever imagine going to bar with him and having a drink. Totally different when you don't call the person teaching you ""Master"" or ""Sensei"".

There is, to a certain fundamentalist mindset, the notion that any sort of ""paranormal"" power is literally ""the work of the Devil"".    This from biblical injunctions against divination, magic, and so forth.  Now, since these sorts of things are mentioned...It's also put the fundamentalist into the trap of HAVING to believe such nonsense exists.....It's in the Bible, after all. So at the very same time that they think that paranormal powers are real, they are forced to see them as belonging to Old Nick. Rather than taking the skeptical view and dismissing them as nonsense.  No doubt the author of this video sees the various claimed martial arts ""powers"" as falling into the same category....And thus being ""satanic"".  Which also very odd because as we know there is a fairly thriving ""Christian Martial Arts"" movement......So go figure."

For example, push out on a chest press and slowly lower the bar and then explosively push out again.

martialarts,3dhqzr,Bikewer,2,Thu Jul 16 16:45:20 2015 UTC,"A few years ago when I had the time to lift more seriously I did cycles that looked like this:  5x5 twice a week on Bench, Squats, Deadlifts, OHP, increasing weight by 5lbs each week for 4 weeks. Then switching to 3x3 at whatever my ending set was and increasing by 10lbs each week for 4 weeks, then switching to 3x1 at whatever my ending set was and increasing by 10lbs each week. I would then recalculate my max and start over with 5x5 at 70% of my new max.  At the time I had a 235lb squat, a 315lb deadlift, and a 195lb bench press at a body weight of 153lbs. Which is pretty decent. I stopped lifting seriously and lost 10lbs, and about 20 lbs off of my squat and dead, and about 50lbs off of my bench, so I am currently rebuilding now that I have time to lift again."

Folks have to understand that the way their bodies respond to progressive resistance training will have to do with their individual physical makeup...The percentage of slow-twitch muscle fiber to fast-twitch and that sort of thing.  I generally make three divisions...    Strength training....Heavy weights, low reps, working to failure point.  General conditioning.... reps in the 10-15 range, gradual increases in reps followed by weight increases and dropping back to the original rep range.  Bodybuilding...Almost an entirely different discipline since it involves specific diet strategies and ""cycling"" through different phases of lifting. Successful bodybuilding relies on having a very high percentage of fast-twitch muscle fiber.....If you don't....You will not be successful."

martialarts,3dhq5b,zfancy5,6,Thu Jul 16 10:57:16 2015 UTC,"Sorry this got pretty long. I hope it helps though. Any questions please ask.  Ok first question is what are your goals? Get fit? Self defense? Look cool? become a professional or amateur fighter?   Second question is what is available to you in your area, there is no point a bunch of us recommending an art where the nearest club to you is 4 hours drive away.   In regards to your fears about Krav Maga they are fair ones. For a good Krav Maga school they need to be a school that spars and pressure tests a lot. Sparring if you don't know is basically a simulated fight where both participants are trying to beat the other guy or achieve a certain goal sparring isn't where you learn learn techniques but it is where you try out and test them, its also where you learn distance, timing, reactions that kinda thing. It doesn't need to be the majority of training and it doesn't need to be full force but it needs to be there and at least some of it needs to be hard enough contact you can be realistic about what works and doesn't instead of convincing yourself you can walk through anything because the sparring is light. A good Krav Maga school will teach you decent defensive concepts like awareness, deescalation and quickly going from nothing to aggressive before looking to escape.  Quality control in arts like BJJ, Muay Thai in MMA tend to be better and the fact you can look up competition records helps  you vet potential schools. BJJ will make you a better grappler than Krav Maga will, Muay Thai will make you a better Striker and MMA will make you a better fighter but they wont teach you self defense concepts like awareness, scanning for alternative targets, deescalation and so on. So if you care about self defense and train one of these arts pick up some books on self defense in order to help round out the non fighting side of things.  I started my martial arts journey in Krav Maga but my personal opinion which others may disagree with is that its better to get a sport delivery system (By that I mean learn how to fight using things contact sports training like MMA, BJJ, Judo, Muay Thai, Boxing, Sanda etc)  so you learn how to fight effectively when its needed and supplement that with books on self defense first and then later take up Krav Maga later in order help build up your self defense skill set at a later date. This also helps because you will then have experience in full contact training and sparring and you will be able to tell more easily a Krav Maga with good training methods from one with poor training methods.   Good Points about BJJ: Great on the ground, great at controlling people without hurting but allows you to ramp up the level of force if you wish, Lots of competitions and sparring to test your techniques, generally if you get hold of someone who cant grapple its going to be hard for them to get you off them.  I am going to go over briefly what I consider pros and cons of the arts you have mentioned. These are generality and will not cover every club so please keep that in mind.  Bad Points: Very ground focused, Can be very dangerous to use against multiple attackers, no striking defense taught in pure BJJ, Many BJJ clubs often do too little stand up grappling.   Good Points about Krav Maga: Focuses on the self concepts outside of fighting, Covers both striking and grappling, uses scenario training such as talking instead of fighting, keeping your distance to stop yourself getting surrounded etc.  Bad points about Krav Maga: Poor quality control, Many places don't spar, grappling that is there is sparse, lack of avenues to test your techniques outside of your club, many (not all) clubs focus too much on going from 0-100 in terms of aggression and forget to teach a use of force spectrum where you use a different level of force depending on the situation.   My recommendation would be if you train Krav Maga consider training BJJ alongside it. Krav Maga stresses not to go to the ground but often you don't have that choice, BJJ will help you get to your feet.   If you train BJJ consider supplementing it with a more stand up focused art like Judo if you want to grapple, throw and control or Muay Thai and boxing if you want to know how to strike and defend against strikes.   Personally I would suggest looking at Judo or wrestling if you are going to be a police officer, as grappling and controlling a suspect is going to be the majority of the physical altercations you have on the job."
martialarts,3dhq5b,Carlos13th,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:18:35 2015 UTC,I really appreciate the long response! Just so you know I'm in an area that provides mostly all martial arts. To answer your first question I'm looking to do martial arts for mainly self-defense. I want to be in control of the situation if I have to be. Not looking to hurt someone unless it becomes necessary and it's for my own survival. As far as far as it goes with sparring I'm up for really any kind of sparring as long as I'm doing it. As far as being in law enforcement I feel like both these martial arts are extremely valuable and useful. I guess one major aspect I'm looking for at this time is to be able to use authoritative action. One of my negative things that was pointed out during the hiring process was that I have never been in a fight or had to use physical force. So maybe something that can give me an experience in that would be best.
martialarts,3dhq5b,Carlos13th,3,Thu Jul 16 11:34:41 2015 UTC,"My recommendation would personally be MMA, Wrestling, Judo, BJj or Sambo as I am going to assume you are not allowed to use striking as your first option meaning you really want to know how to grapple and control your opponent.  But yeah number one thing make sure you are sparring a lot."
martialarts,3dhq5b,Carlos13th,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:21:43 2015 UTC,"Ok. Yeah im thinking about doing BJJ. Yeah we will box spar in the academy some but not too much. More focus on takedowns and controlling and apprehension of a suspect. Mostly to be able to handcuff and stop any further physical threat. Also how can I tell if the place is legit. I mean on the site it explains ""the owner is a student of so and so..."" doesn't mean anything to me haha. Also the price. What normal going rate? Here it is $119/month for the first 3 months which is the begginers course. 4th month is free. So I guess it's $90/month for the 4 month begginers course."
martialarts,3dhq5b,SVPPB,2,Thu Jul 16 12:38:27 2015 UTC,"In BJJ look for places that do well in competition and that spar often. Look for people who clearly state their rank and if they state their comp record and who awarded them their rank even better.   Normal going rate is utterly meaningless because the costs in the middle of no where operating out of a matted barn are going to be a lot different to the costs in the center of New York or London.   Look at other BJJ gyms in your area, compare the cost, look at how much you make a month and decide if the money is worth the training. Look at how often you can go, how often you want to go and if the price per class feels worthwhile to you.  To give you a very rough idea $90 a month is a little more than my club charges for training three times a week.  Consider mixing judo with BJJ btw if you have both the time and funds. That way you will have more options to take a suspect to the ground than BJJ alone will give you."
martialarts,3dhq5b,SVPPB,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:51:02 2015 UTC,Ok I'll look at these things. Thanks for all the info. Seems like I can't really go wrong with BJJ if that's what I choose.

If only there was a very popular, sparring-heavy martial art that revolved entirely about taking down and controlling an opponent. Something like BJJ, but with a simpler ground game, and rules that reward throws and pins.  Maybe a sport with a rich tradition in law enforcement, and actively encouraged by police academies worldwide."

Or, in the case the suspect surprises the cop and gets the upper hand, how to survive, reverse and take control.  Learning to punch, kick and some knife defenses from Krav isn't bad but since police spend a lot of time grappling and restraining I think BJJ might be the better time spent."
martialarts,3dhq5b,Carlos13th,2,Thu Jul 16 12:44:08 2015 UTC,"In general, search your area for the best school with the best instructor you can find and go with it. Any martial art is good and its better to get good instruction in a good environment than it is to pay alot and waste your time with a shitty school and instructor.  Specifically for law enforcement, you want something with pressure in the training. MMA, Krav, Kali, Wrestling, anything along those lines. You cant be the perfect warrior out on the streets but if you can do a few moves well under pressure thats pretty great."

My class teaches basic striking and locking with police batons (we have lots of police and private security in our class), although if you are into MA at all you can probably learn the technique and extrapolate the baton application and how useful it will be.  I would take a few classes of FMA at bare minimum and train with a baton at home, it will make your forearm muscles strong for other arts.  As previously stated, I would recommend BJJ marginally over Krav Maga but neither is a complete solution.  Judo and wrestling are both fantastic choices."
martialarts,3dhq5b,BukkakeAtAFuneral,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:18:19 2015 UTC,"Depending on what's available and relevant for a cop I've to say neither bjj or km. Here's my 2cents from training both.   Krav Maga: It was my first MA and one that I really enjoyed. While it gets a ton of flack, the place I went to was pretty legit. There were actually a lot of cops (4 if that's a lot) who trained there. We did regular sparring and a ton of situational drills over and over. The repetition was great so much so that it really drills down the muscle memory to a great degree. However I don't think this is good for a cop. Mostly because the techniques will likely cause you to lose your job. Correct me if I'm wrong but cops are not typically expected to eye gouge, kick the groin, deliver constant blows to the head only to train to evade and run away. If anything you guys are expected to control a perp and stay on the scene. KM is all about attacking violently, fast, using muscle memory, and then getting the hell out of there. In a hostile situation you'll always revert back to your training. Thinking that you can modify the techniques during a fight or flight response just won't work.   BJJ: While there's no question it is an effective MA almost every school I've been to rarely starts standing and pretty much is teaching it as a sport. I think the Gracie Combatives program would definitely be useful. But again you probably wouldn't want to be pulling guard on the streets or rolling around with your gun exposed.   Of all the popular martial arts Judo would have to be the most practical for a cop. Otherwise if you can find one i'd recommend some sort of combat training designed for police/military."

martialarts,3dhq5b,Carlos13th,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:12:40 2015 UTC,Careful with the Gracie combatives stuff. While the techniques they teach are sound they often do no sparring until blue belt in order to promote student retention. You don't want to be training for six months or more than a year before you get to test anything you do so end up with false confidence.

martialarts,3dhq5b,Carlos13th,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:22:00 2015 UTC,I was talking about Gracie combatives in previous post.   Most grappling styles so get you sparring pretty soon. Bjj within tbd first few classes. Just once you have Learnt how to break fall.   Striking will usual take a little longer.   I am Personally not a fan of the Gracie combatives business model and the fact they Give Bjj blue belts to people who have never sparred.

Gracie jiu jitsu alone is too generic a name for me to say anything about the place based on it alone as Gracie jiu jitsu and Brazilian jiu jitsu are the same thing.

Might be helpful if you're joining the military or for personal self-defence if you live in a rough neighbourhood.  Keep in mind this is just a very broad generalisation.  BJJ might be better if you're going into law enforcement as it teaches you restraint and control, and calculated dominance over another individual, you decide how much pressure you want to apply, and how little or how much you want to hurt him/her.  *edit - another very good option is judo."

Not the training methods, those seem solid as fuck, actually I'm a little jealous, but what's the legal ramifications of things like preemptive strikes and brandishing? I imagine it's not a clear cut issue, like everything else, but could you realistically face charges in a situation like this?"
martialarts,3dfjbi,Apollo78,3,Thu Jul 16 01:19:52 2015 UTC,Check your local laws would be the best answer to that question.   Edit: Don't forget to look at case law when possible. Law as written is also informed by precedent set by individual cases. So far example if your law says that you can sucker punch someone if you feel threatened (or something close to that) but in several cases where this has happened people have been convicted for that action you may find that its a less legally sound thing to do than the word of the law might suggest.

martialarts,3dfjbi,HouseOfWard,2,Thu Jul 16 05:39:14 2015 UTC,"Great video, only critique is that the defender shows no threat or intent of using the weapon, and the assailant seems to pick up on it and close to grappling distances.  Good having the back up hand to continue defending, but a big risk pulling a weapon in disarming range that you don't intend to use.  Tough situation, but once that gun is pulled, you have to have absolute control of the situation. Especially if your assailant also has a concealed weapon."

The guy had thrown the knife and my grampa turned his head at the exact worst time. He was 13 at the time.  I always wondered ""What if he hadn't turned around?""... Blade would have probably hit the back of his head and done minimal damage. Instead it hit his soft eye ball and penetrated.   Always a risk."

And sometimes, your attacker is faster than you and will run up to you and stab you from behind.   Or you run and twist your ankle or slip and wind up on the ground with a guy standing over you, cutting off pieces .  I'd say you go case by case, but the odds favor using two hands over one.  That's the well researched opinion of a lot of high contact knife and stick fighters including Burton Richardson.  Watch some videos, and spend a few hours training with different people, and you'll figure out what works and what doesn't for yourself."
martialarts,3decbj,delicate_flower,13,Thu Jul 16 03:56:43 2015 UTC,"When I was taught basic knife defense - for when you have no option to run - it was about mitigating how badly and where you got cut.

martialarts,3decbj,Apollo78,6,Wed Jul 15 18:31:13 2015 UTC,"I should have been more clear.. Rather than grabbing at the knife with two hands, you try to control the knife hand with one hand and slash at that arm.  The intent is to render them unable to use it to continue to attack you with it.  Rather than trying to stab them in the chest or whatever, slash at the fleshy parts of their arm holding the knife.  If you can slice the muscle or tendons, you can make it so that they can't attack you with that hand even if they wanted to.  Keep all of your movements flowing.  You don't want to stab.  Unlike a bullet that has a single trajectory, you can swing a blade to cover a wide path.  Keep it controlled, but don't try to ""poke into"" the person.. try to move across them and slice them up as much as possible.  Of course, if they have half a clue, that's what they're going to be doing to you, too.  That's why you fucking run."
martialarts,3decbj,MindReboot,8,Wed Jul 15 18:42:52 2015 UTC,"Grab their knife, no, the handle is small so you'd only be able to grab the blade. Grab their arm, yes, although you can't be overly fixated on it as they can just switch hands."
martialarts,3decbj,anonlymouse,9,Wed Jul 15 17:28:06 2015 UTC,"And, while any control over the knife arm is better than none, its optimal to have control over the arm in such a way that the knife is ""to the side and behind"" your body rather than trying to keep the knife directly in front of your center of mass.  Beyond all that, once you have control of the knife arm, your entire focus should be on inflicting as much damage as possible to the attacker's core (head, trunk, legs) etc as quickly as possible.  DO NOT ATTEMPT TO DISARM. In many cases the worst cuts will result from disarm attempts as all you have to work against is the blade.  Disarms occur via creating incapacitating damage, not fancy movements against the knife."

Best policy in my opinion is to avoid the blade all together and not get into a pissing match with an armed assailant.

martialarts,3decbj,sifu_scott,3,Wed Jul 15 18:36:21 2015 UTC,"No matter how you engage in a knife fight expect to get cut. In basic they told us if someone uses a knife, use our gun or callout for a buddy who use his gun. Worst case was actually engaging in a knife fight."
martialarts,3decbj,Yanrogue,3,Wed Jul 15 17:36:13 2015 UTC,"Well, I may be one of the few who disagrees with the very common idea that ""you will get cut"", I would amend it to ""you may get cut"".  Maybe I'm just an idealist but I dislike the idea of going into it thinking ""It's impossible for me to do this perfectly, I'm going to screw something up and get cut.""  I have been taught multiple methods, the first of which uses one arm to intercept the knife arm while you throat strike with the other arm.  Then from there hook the back of the elbow and row the knife arm down to your hip to trap it while you continue to smash the attacker's face.   Then you have the option of just staying there and keep striking him until he cannot hold the knife anymore, or possibly transitioning into a hammerlock.  The second I have been taught was to use both hands to strike the knife arm to intercept the initial stab and then quickly transition into an armbar.  They both have pros and cons, with the first method a pro is that it does damage which may make your attacker hesitate for long enough to make the difference, but only has one arm keeping the knife away from your body which makes it easier for the attacker to power through.  With the second, a pro is that when you intercept the arm it is extremely powerful, a con is that it requires both hands, and if for whatever reason you miss the knife arm you are leaving yourself largely defenseless since both your arms end up out past the attacker's hip leaving them free to punch you with their other hand, or stab you multiple times.  When it works it works fantastically."
martialarts,3decbj,MacintoshEddie,3,Wed Jul 15 20:00:09 2015 UTC,"Human reaction time being limited as it is, drawing your knife is probably a better bet because your assailant will now have to worry about getting cut.  What do they have to worry about when they hold the only weapon? A lot less than you'd think. Weapons exist for a reason. I know the movies make it look like with proper training you can basically nullify the advantage that a weapon gives someone, but you can't. The person with the weapon ALWAYS has the advantage.  So, draw your knife. Try to fuck up their arms, keep your torso out of there, make it not worth it for them to pursue.  Alternatively, if you really don't like the idea of using your knife, try to find something in the environment. A chair, for instance. Use it to keep them at a distance, maybe try to trip them up with it, I don't know."
martialarts,3decbj,Enthused_Llama,3,Wed Jul 15 20:48:33 2015 UTC,"Practice it.

You without ego (Often harder to find, but with the right mindset, easily obtained.)  Set up:  Attacker has drawn Training knife  Defender has a Training knife in a pocket  Option 1:  Defender grabs Attacker's wrist and at about 40-50% or less the attacker tries to attack defender.  Defender tries to get to better position of control, disarm opponent, or otherwise make attacker unable to continue doing harm to defender.  Switch roles.  repeat as able.  Increase speed as warranted.  Option B:  Set up:  Attacker has drawn training knife  Defender has no knife drawn, but one in a pocket (preferably the same way that they carry one).  Stand 6 to 8 feet apart.   At about 30-50% attacker tries to score hits on defender.  Any hits count.  If you want, you can use lipstick, Vasoline and snap line chalk, or whatever you can find to mark where you got hit.  I don't think it's necessary, but some people just need to ""See"" what's happening.  I just use the bruises, or the red marks.  Now what?  See what works and what doesn't.  Try running and have attacker give chase.  Do this in a room with tables and chairs.  Have a third party stand in for your SO or child or elderly dear grandma or something else you'd rather not give to a bad guy.  Now you can't run.  How does this change what you do and how you go about it?  When do you draw your knife?  When do you go for control?    It's more complicated than most folks think about.  I'm seeing TONS of ""Just run"", and that's good advice, but it's not always an option.  Ok, so that said, what do you do?  It's an important thing to think about.    I would imagine with a little exposure like this, and a touch of guidance, many of the ""Runners"" around here would be quite surprised at their ability to defend themselves when they had to as opposed to run.

Just things to think about....If someone is intent on doing you harm with the knife, then he will likely keep it concealed until you are grabbed-and-stabbed.   The standard prison ""shanking""technique. Many people who have been the victims of such attacks have reported that they never saw the knife and thought they were being punched.....Till they found themselves leaking body fluids.  However....If the individual is hoping to intimidate you, as in a mugging, then he may or may not have any real knowledge of how to employ the knife as a weapon.... As an old friend said...""Some folks carry knives because they are scared to death of them.....They think you will be too.""  In such case, deploying your own weapon may very well cause the individual to depart the scene....He doesn't want to get cut either.  Running is nice...If you're capable.  I'm not... The attacker would likely be disabled by laughter should I try such a thing.   Better....Improvised defensive weapons.   Anything.... Chairs, trash-can lids, your coat, any object to employ as an impact weapon.....  Best....Glock-fu.    Note that the use of Glock-fu implies a certain expertise with the weapon.

martialarts,3decbj,Bikewer,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:51:16 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with ""glock-fu."" If the knife wielder is 20 feet away and sprints for an attack, the gun-fighter will get stabbed although maybe he can get off a single round if he's quite skilled and expecting the attack. At less than 20 feet, the gunfighter is fucked. And this is assuming the gunfighter knows the knife attack is coming and is ready to accurately quick-draw. If the weapon is concealed, then good fucking luck.   Exhibit 1: SWAT Magazine, ""How close is too close?"" Exhibit 2: Dan Inosanto demonstrates the speed and effective range of a knife attack against trained, but not expecting, LEOs. Exhibit 3: Mythbusters testing of the Tueller drill.

Comes down again to the situation, the skill level of the individual with the knife, and the skill level of the individual with the gun.  I've seen all those demonstrations and have participated in such scenarios a number of times over the years.    A couple of things to remember...  Very few knife-attackers are highly-skilled, fast, agile...Trained individuals.  A more likely situation for an actual attack (as opposed to the ""give me your wallet"" mugging...) is a lunatic fueled by drugs or alcohol.  Likewise, the skill level of the person with the gun has to be taken into account. Take the ""Mythbusters"" segment.   They had Adam actually racking the pistol as Jamie charged him.....Lunacy....And he still reliably ""shot"" Jamie at about the same time Jamie was getting his ""point"" home With a proper draw, Jamie would have absorbed several bullets enroute.  If Adam was retreating while Jamie was charging....Several more.  I can put an awful lot of rounds downrange in a very short time...  I read Bill Jordan's ""No Second Place Winner"" in 1965, when it came out.  That's a treatise on police gunfighting techniques and tactics.  Jordan was an advocate of fast-draw training for police and was remarkable himself. Draw-to-hit (standard silhouette at 7 yards) times of .2 seconds.   Including reaction time.  Standard police revolver and belt rig.  On the other hand, I've known coppers who couldn't achieve three times that speed, and seen civilian (or off-duty) rigs that would render any sort of fast draw impossible.   I mentioned the wife's purse.  There are so many variables.... At very short range,  going for a weapon in the face of a sudden attack is foolish....One must use ""force on force"" to establish time/distance before going for the weapon. At any decent tactical distance, the rapid deployment of the weapon is preferable.  Overall.....In ANY situation involving a knife attack or threat, I'd take my G27 over any other scenario.   (Unless I can have a shotgun...)"
martialarts,3decbj,Bikewer,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:32:12 2015 UTC,"Excellent response, thanks for taking the time. I don't disagree with the points that you made, but they're anecdotal, N=1.  From a certain perspective, the mythbusters test might actually reflect the reality that this thread is the subject of a bit better than the Tueller tests do. Neither Jamie or Adam have military or civilian-tactical background. Neither does your average gun owner and/or knife attacker. So Adam racking the pistol after the draw during Jamie's attack, while ridiculous, might be representative of the type of costly mistake someone might make if they're not accustomed to the stress and adrenaline of a real SHTF scenario. Forgetting to unsafety the firearm in the moment is a thing. Forgetting to chamber a round if the pistol is carried kept in C3 is an easy oversight to make. (I like the cocked and locked M1911 for this reason.)  And honestly, it doesn't take that much skill to inflict grievous physical damage with a knife. Anybody can run with scissors and fuck someone up.   So the point I was trying to make is that even trained law enforcement can get into trouble being overly reliant on a firearm if the distance is not great enough. Hell, bayonets are still a (albeit rare) thing in modern warfare!  Anyway, you're spot on in saying that it's situationally dependent, as all combat tactics are. Guns aren't always the best answer nor deterrent (though they often are) and should be considered a useful tool, but not one-size-fits-all. And even those who do carry regularly, don't carry all the time.   Cheers. Before I ramble on anymore than I already have. :)"

People are always after simple answers, and they want them summed up in simple sentences too. Sadly, this quickly leads to oversimplification, and the total loss of nuance is so reductionist as to make intelligent discussion largely impossible.   So you have a knife if your pocket and an aggressor is approaching you with a knife of his own. Wouldn't it be best to, instead of pulling out your own knife, using both hands to grab the attackers knife (or otherwise defend yourself)?   Pulling out your knife is defending yourself.

With that being said in terms of martial defense it is definitely better to use a weapon if you can. Either an improvised one from nearby items or a knife if you openly carry one. Firstly it will psychologically prevent your oppo ent from acting as aggressively. A person with a knife is going to act differently against an unarmed opponent than against an armed opponent. Secondly with your own knife you have a lot more opportunities for techniques to counter. E.g.: you can stab them in a vital spot before they het a chance to stab you, or you can disarm them more effectively than empty-handed techniques by cutting at the fingers or for the inside of their forearms (slicing through their nerves and artery groups)."

martialarts,3decbj,ltran96,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:03:16 2015 UTC,"After doing FMA for about three years now I feel like I am somewhat qualified to begin to answer this question.   Run.   If you dont engage the person and just run, as in the knife comes out and there is no physical contact, you win. You avoid getting cut and you get to go home and have dinner with your family. If you decide that you NEED to grab a hold of the person then you need to figure a way out. What happens when you let go of that blade? How do you disengage? If you get him in the perfect wrist lock with your one hand and draw your knife with the other what is your next move? That person is going to HAVE to fight harder and you cant rely on having something that scares him off. If you go to cut him are you 100% sure under pressure that you are only going to cut him? Lets say you cut his jugular and he bleeds out textbook style. Now you have all of his blood born pathogens all over the place. Doctors, nurses, and surgeons as well as care workers go through months of testing to ensure that exposure to DROPS of patients blood dont transmit HIV or Hepatitis. How are you going to ensure that the 2.5L of his blood that you have on your shirt and pants didnt contact your eye accidentally?   There is nothing really glorious about a knife fight. Its a really horrible thing and there is alot of myth behind what happens. I think there are alot of martial arts that do well by considering it as a thing, and I think most FMA does a good job of exercising ways to not get cut, or to minimize cutting vital spots, but there is no guarantee. I think there are alot of martial arts schools teaching techniques that are not practical in fighting, are maybe OK for general self defense, but dont teach the responsibility that comes after engaging someone with a knife.  The three most qualified people that taught me knife anything, two said: ""Run. Dont bother. Run. Unless you ARE the police officer AND you have a gun. Run."" (This includes if you are NOT the police and have a gun. One of the two is a police officer.) The other one said ""If you see a guy with a knife and he is dancing a blade around to scare you, and you are looking to show off (your fancy stick technique) then thats ok. If he shows one small indication that he knows what hes doing, run. (Even if you have a knife.)"" Im not sure with that advice that I would opt in to doing any hand to knife technique, ever, unless I had someone I absolutely had to defend that was immobile.

martialarts,3decbj,zanshinv,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:15:03 2015 UTC,"If there's a knife, you'll almost absolutely go into close quarters with the guy. No matter what style you use, there's a chance that you'll get hurt. Unless you really know how to wield a knife without injuring or opening yourself up to strikes, just run."
martialarts,3decbj,survivalife,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:01:01 2015 UTC,"Depends on the situation. If the guy is more than 10 paces away, run. If he's really intent on hurting you, and he's less than 10 paces away, by the time you've turned around he's going to be on top of you and kill stab you in your (now defensless) back.   The problem with grabbing his knife is that you have to reach for the knife. And a skilled knife fighter will probably just bum rush you and jam you with his body while he stabs the shit out of you. Having your knife out might prevent him from being so eager to get close to you.   That being said, you don't want to be in the situation where you're trying to stop him stabbing you while you hold him off with one arm and fiddle-fuck with your knife in your pocket with the other.  So here's what you do. IF you get your knife out, you're either going to use it to slash the everliving shit out of anything that even looks like its going near you. Hopefully he'll decide its not worth the risk and back off.   If you don't have your knife out, or don't have a knife, you're going to do 4 things. 1) Get really, REALLY angry (fear will help here). 2)Scream bloody murder (the more insane the better). These two things will drive your adrenaline through the roof and put you in ""attack mode"". 3) You're going to smash your arm into his arm holding the knife as hard as you can. Don't worry about the knife, try and break his arm with how hard you hit it. 4) with your other arm, AT THE SAME TIME, you're going to go right for his eyes/tracheya and do your best to maim him. And then get the fuck out as soon as you can.  Lastly, learn some first aid. A tourniquet could save your life."

martialarts,3decbj,dartleader,4,Wed Jul 15 18:18:28 2015 UTC,"If you try to grab the knife with both hands, you have nothing protecting your face.    You hear this a lot in some FMA's. The more I've pressure tested stuff, the less I agree with it. A lot of FMA knife defense, like knife tapping, is ultimately about creating room to draw your own blade and attack.  The moment you are dealing with a concerted stabbing effort, one on one is just not going to be enough to mitigate the attack. The only exception to this is if you can effectively trap the arm (in an arm hook) and prevent it from stabbing.  If you can't achieve that, and you don't have your own weapon, then I'd much rather go 2 on 1 than have to deal with continual stabbings."
martialarts,3decbj,mattBernius,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:37:20 2015 UTC,"Using both hands on their knife arm is by far the most common defence I've seen in WMA manuscripts and some other TMAs that deal with knives. Leverage that arm, take it away from their body. You can still kick, knee and headbutt as you leverage that arm and use it."
martialarts,3decbj,flyliceplick,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:56:51 2015 UTC,"Again, 2 on 1 is better than nothing. The issue I personally have with 2 on 1 is that it keeps the blade pointed at your core in a wrestling position. If you have solid control and move fast, you are ok. But if keep the knife in front of you and they get their other hand involved you end up in a position where you risk slashing/stabbing yourself in the struggle of the knife."
martialarts,3decbj,mattBernius,2,Wed Jul 15 19:14:00 2015 UTC,"One of the things we practice doing with Two on one type grabs is making a transition to a better control, preferably away from the free hand.  Usually some sort of arm bar.    Place a practice knife in your hand and then have someone grab your wrist in a two on one.  Go at about 50%.   Without much training, the unarmed guy won't get hit all that often, and unless there's a significant size AND skill discrepancy, they most likely won't get stabbed either.  Knives are so fast that I'd rather get control of it with both arms and use position and off balancing to mitigate taking damage from a hand or foot.  There are ways to disarm them, but we tend to try and disable the opponent through strikes like kicks or knees while fighting for control.  If you get to a wrap over situation, say with your left arm, I think that's where you could transition to your weapon with your right.  For me, though, I'd be going for an arm break or something first.  Maybe even a take down where I can remain standing, or taking them down ONTO something like a curb or light pole or a table; basically what ever's around."

martialarts,3dge66,sreiches,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:07:48 2015 UTC,"I assume you're talking about something like Nike Free Runs?  I'd stay away from running shoes for martial arts practice. They're really only designed to carry you forward and facilitate the S-curve of a running step. The biggest issue is that they lack lateral stability.  You're almost better off with basketball shoes (very neutral sole, often with some pivot points, but lighter than tennis shoes). There are also training shoes, which have more lateral stability than running shoes. And you can get Nike Free soles on them. They can actually have too much traction for quick pivots and such, though.  Wrestling shoes are just going to be the best option for the average boxer. Fairly flat, pivot-focused soles for the most part."

I use them to prevent toe injuries. There is a really nice flat  ball and they pivot exceptionally well (doing panantuken/ filipino kickboxing)."

martialarts,3dhodj,turbonerd3000,15,Thu Jul 16 10:31:00 2015 UTC,"I would wager that for most people who post here asking how to increase power generation, technique is their limiting factor, not raw strength."
martialarts,3dhodj,jujiroll,3,Thu Jul 16 10:45:00 2015 UTC,Why? most people are weak.
martialarts,3dhodj,twat69,2,Thu Jul 16 18:13:09 2015 UTC,"Not really. Assuming they are an able bodied adult they are not going to be so weak it makes a real difference.  If they are on here asking vague questions about how to get more power, and the idea of lifting weights is a big revelation to them, then chances are they are complete beginners and their technique deficiencies are much greater than their strength differences.  If they start lifting, most of their gains are going to be from learning lifting technique. That's nice and all, but it isn't going to do much for their fighting ability. So if that was their priority, they didn't make good use of their time."
martialarts,3dhodj,jujiroll,6,Thu Jul 16 22:24:55 2015 UTC,"It's not as simple as that. For most folks having power issues the problem is likely technique. I've known guys that were incredibly strong but weren't particularly big hitters because their form was lacking.   For punches to be powerful you need to make sure a few things are happening.   You are rotating your shoulders to the point that the non punching shoulder is all the way back. You need to be turning your hips over into the shot. You need to make sure you are transferring your weight with the shot. For instance with the straight right my body weight should be resting over or closer to over my lead leg at the end of the shot. You are relaxed. The more you tense up and think ""power"" the less you have. A powerful shot just sort of flows, you aren't ""throwing"" your hands you're letting them go.  The appropriate foot needs to be pivoting or pushing in the correct direction. Again with the straight right for example your right foot needs to be driving the shot forward.   You can be ridiculously strong but still not get anywhere near the power you should if your technique sucks."
martialarts,3dhodj,Arkansan13,2,Thu Jul 16 14:41:23 2015 UTC,Being strong and having good technique is better than just having good technique but strength isnt a fix all for everything.
martialarts,3dhodj,Carlos13th,2,Thu Jul 16 20:42:47 2015 UTC,"Exactly, someone who is strong but has no technique isn't living up to their potential. Of course someone who has great form but is weak isn't hitting potential either.  Then there is that x factor, something special some punches have that makes them dangerous."
martialarts,3dhodj,Arkansan13,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:33:12 2015 UTC,I think sadly people on both side of the argument get a but stuck with some claiming that strength is the answer to all and others claiming that strength not only doesn't help but somehow makes it worse.
martialarts,3dhodj,Carlos13th,2,Thu Jul 16 22:04:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I still hear a lot of boxers say that any sort of weight lifting actively hurts your boxing."
martialarts,3dhodj,Arkansan13,3,Thu Jul 16 22:15:35 2015 UTC,"Lifting weights can help, but often to a much lower degree than learning structure and form and what is suitable in a given situation.  By that I mean the difference between a jab and a proper punch.  You can lift weights for years, do steroids and everything, but if all you can do is jab you would benefit significantly from learning how to use your core to add power.  Another important thing is range.  Some people have a habit of only knowing how to strike at one particular distance, and do not know how to alter the strike for optimum power at other distances.  A few inches farther away or closer can make significant differences in power delivery."
martialarts,3dhodj,MacintoshEddie,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:13:47 2015 UTC,This isn't really true. Lifting weights can go both ways. You can actually reduce your power output depending on your training. Also generating high power from say a snatch is totally different that a kick or punch. Basically training a lineman for power and martial artist two completely different things. This coming from someone who trains athletes and has a PhD in Exercise Science. But I would definitely agree that resistance training would be beneficial for martial artists. Just depends on how it's administered.
martialarts,3dhodj,ProfHotTub,-3,Thu Jul 16 19:16:54 2015 UTC,"Please, I'd like to have more gorillas at the dojo! Though yes, strength training probably helps.

martialarts,3dhodj,owlbeeokay,8,Thu Jul 16 11:41:44 2015 UTC,"This statement is simplistic, unsophisticated, and staggeringly incorrect.  There is no scenario, in all of human combat, where more strength/muscle is not an asset."
martialarts,3dhodj,The_Scrapper,-1,Thu Jul 16 13:48:19 2015 UTC,"There are, however, ways in which strength training can cause one to learn wrong technique and gain an unrealistic perception of their technique: Only using hands to punch (because you can punch harder than anyone else there, anyway), Not bending from the knees in throws (because you can throw anyone anyway, you might not even notice), would be my points in the comment above.  I'm not sure if it's the context that causes misunderstanding, but I was commenting on weight lifting as a way of adding power to techniques."
martialarts,3dhodj,owlbeeokay,2,Thu Jul 16 15:59:30 2015 UTC,"Only bad training or a bad student can generate a bad technique. If a strong person and a weak person are given the correct instruction, and apply it, then there is no difference in the equality of the technique they have learned.  Strength allows for mistakes to be less catastrophic, but it is not the cause of the poor technique. Strength training will not create this issue; and it can only improve your performance (provided your instruction is good and you are not a crappy student)."
martialarts,3dhodj,The_Scrapper,-1,Thu Jul 16 18:11:29 2015 UTC,"That's idiotic. You should have muscle but weights are not the key to strong techniques, the only weights I use are dumbbells and bodyweight and I punch and kick 5 times harder than the big body builder down at our gym. Proper technique, balance and understanding of your body and the physics behind it is key.  In fact, too much muscle slows you down, makes you unflexible and thereby decreases your power."

Of course I advice you to ask your doctor, but if that's too hard I'll say at least read the manual of the medications, there should read if they're dangerous to take with some natural (or otherwise) remedies... probabbly with the advice of asking your doctor. Usually I'd say with depression it's only helping, maybe so with ADHD and such as well; to be frank with you, most depression medications are nootropics as well. Most decrease the rate of serotonin leaving your brain, making it easier to focus for a longer time and keeping mood elevated; some also do the same for noradrenaline.  Nootropics are a wide, wide category of stuff, and I would argue even eating fruits and vegetables serve as nootropics. I'd just advice you to take vitamin C and B supplements (at least B in moderate amounts, it's fat soluble instead of water soluble so it doesn't leave the body the same way C does when overdosed) because those most probably won't affect you in any adverse way despite of any medication."

martialarts,3daoqq,vkashen,22,Wed Jul 15 13:10:21 2015 UTC,"Wow, you can see the moment when the attacker realizes what a fucking idiot he was. motorcyclist: ""...and you think that's the right thing to do?"" idiot:  ""...<oh shit, I'm a retard>"""
martialarts,3daoqq,_eternalreturn_,8,Tue Jul 14 21:40:40 2015 UTC,"Rage can disable the mind, but as you point, the right set of words triggered back his human side. I kind of feel sorry for the dude."
martialarts,3daoqq,mattBernius,19,Tue Jul 14 22:00:00 2015 UTC,"This is a perfect example of ""good (I'm assuming) person having bad day"" and doing something really, really stupid.   And why it is so critical to have a scaling self-defense response so you have options that doing involve gouging out some dudes eyes, breaking their knees, stabbing them in multiple places, and tearing off their groin.   Also, proof that being able to grapple can be extremely useful in ""street"" self defense and that there are reasons to intentionally go to the ground.  Definitely saving this one for future use."
martialarts,3daoqq,karatecoder,4,Tue Jul 14 22:57:53 2015 UTC,"While of course grappling is great in a situation like this, having the full face motorcycle helmet helps your defense. No worries about taking a shot to the head or face, which is where most rage/aggressive and untrained attackers are going."
martialarts,3daoqq,mattBernius,5,Wed Jul 15 14:37:27 2015 UTC,"Beyond the fact that the face section of the helmet was clearly open, it's worth noting that by the time the attacker was taken to the ground and once he reached the ground he was unable to get in any face shots.   In fact, by my count the attacker only threw one wild caveman attack to the head before crashing into the defender.  So, while its true that the helmet would have protected against face shots, it's also pretty clear that the attacker was quickly put into a position where head shots were not particularly possible."
martialarts,3daoqq,karatecoder,2,Wed Jul 15 15:44:06 2015 UTC,"I agree, and perhaps just having the helmet on is a deterrent to head and face shots, even against an enraged and wild attacker. I agree that grappling was the best possible approach to this situation."
martialarts,3daoqq,b-grate,5,Wed Jul 15 17:40:19 2015 UTC,"exactly, in my opinion this demonstrated a great use of controlling the situation and talking the raged out guy out of his rage. being one step ahead of your aggressor instead of being a gun crazed fool that thinks owning a gun IS all the self-defense they need."

martialarts,3daoqq,ithika,6,Wed Jul 15 00:51:01 2015 UTC,people act stupid over driving   Like you wouldn't believe.  I have a theory that riding a bike/motorbike in traffic triggers extra levels of rage because drivers of larger vehicles are kind of hampered by the size of their vehicle which is so much larger than themselves. Their machine which is normally so powerful becomes a liability in creeping traffic. They take out their frustration on smaller vehicles that can navigate properly.
martialarts,3daoqq,Kintanon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:19:08 2015 UTC,I will say that watching some guy on a motorcycle drive down the street between the stalled traffic makes me want to open my door in front of him and damn the consequences. It's CHEATING!
martialarts,3daoqq,ithika,3,Wed Jul 15 17:02:44 2015 UTC,Yeah this is exactly it. Drivers look at their own situation and realise they cannot move so people who can move must be cheating somehow.
martialarts,3daoqq,Kintanon,2,Wed Jul 15 20:02:23 2015 UTC,I think the ability to filter down stalled traffic is more than paid for by heightened risk of death as a motorcyclist.   I think of it less as cheating but more as shit I would be at the front with a bike.

martialarts,3dejm2,KaylaKiss,2,Wed Jul 15 17:31:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not so big on breaking stuff anymore, but I do have this video from my second degree test for TKD, which illustrates both how not to, and how to, properly perform this sort of break:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnxSYQwJBbw  Notice, on the first break, that I look away from the strike, overturning my torso and taking my body out of the blow. Even though I hit with intent to follow-through, my arm and trunk end up disconnected. I also don't ""sink"" particularly far; my weight isn't coming down into the strike as much as it should.  This is corrected in the second attempt.  So here are the big things:  1) Hit the center. You want to be equidistant from the to ends of what you're breaking for maximum efficiency.  2) Hit straight down. If you don't, you're losing force on a vector perpendicular to the break. It's the same reason Kyokushin-ka bring their leg around and up for low roundhouse kicks, so they can snap it down at an angle and t-bone the opponent's leg. This results in maximum power transfer, rather than losing some to an angle.  3) Follow through. Sink through the strike  and aim for the ground.  4) Look directly at your target the whole time. This will keep you from over-torquing and taking your body out of the equation.  Hope this helps!"

martialarts,3dejm2,sreiches,2,Thu Jul 16 10:24:26 2015 UTC,"It's very unlikely that strength is the issue. Breaking is about positioning and leverage to the point where strength is almost an afterthought. Not completely, but almost."

martialarts,3dcmcl,Vennificus,4,Wed Jul 15 06:38:33 2015 UTC,"I think the term ""McDojo"" is being misunderstood in this subreddit sometimes.  McDojo is a subjective sociology label, like dad jeans, paleo diet, or staycations. There's no actual objective definition of a McDojo and polling a group of strangers online isn't going make it one thing or another.   What you need to do, as a student of martial arts, is engage in your journey is such as way that you don't get trapped in a consumer/vendor relationship with your learning. In other words, be careful that you do not start to perceive techniques as commodities that are ""received"" for fees paid to your martial arts ""vendor"". Instead, look to create a partnership with your instructors and fellow students where everyone is learning and benefiting together. Techniques don't exist in isolation. They fit into of a rubric that also includes athletic ability, intellectual understanding, and practice executing the technique under stress.  The business model will vary by style but avoid styles where only one guy has the ""answers"" and you can't easily port your learning to another environment. If your knowledge consists of specialized forms/kata or one-step stuff that are mainly used for the purposes of acquiring rank then it's likely you are not going to get much use out of your efforts outside that particular dojo/dojang/kwoon etc."

martialarts,3da1ul,mma_boxing_wrestling,7,Tue Jul 14 17:51:06 2015 UTC,"Excellent analysis, just two things, could you space the text more? It would make it much more readable.  Second, what do you think about McGregor's tendency to leave his rear foot behind sometimes and be completely out of balance when advancing?.  You noticed his stance issues right away, but what could he do to fix them since that stance is inherently unstable (specially in MMA)?"
martialarts,3da1ul,Little_Johnny20,3,Tue Jul 14 18:21:46 2015 UTC,"Shit sorry about that, just fixed the formatting.   I've been saying for a while that leaving his back foot in the bucket and overextending on his left hand are gonna be big problems for him. It works great when his opponents are essentially running, but against guys who stay in position while McGregor attacks it's gonna get him in trouble.   Fixing them isn't likely. I've almost never seen a fighter completely change the mechanics of how they do something, especially not their favorite punch, this far into their career. McGregor believes more in his offense every fight. As long as he keeps knocking people out, he's gonna keep throwing it with little regard for the consequences.   That said, fixing it would take a lot of drilling. He would have to practice stepping his rear foot forward every time he stepped his lead foot forward, and getting his lower body into position instead of leaning. Essentially, he'd have to relearn the mechanics. While that's not impossible, it isn't realistic. At this point what he's likely to do is work to cover the openings as best he can without compromising his offense, because that's what he values above all else."
martialarts,3da1ul,Little_Johnny20,3,Tue Jul 14 18:36:59 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about the formatting, I only mentioned it because it's a great read and it should be enjoyed at is best.  Something tells me that Aldo won't exploit his ground game as much since he wants to destroy him standing up and show why he's been the king for 10 years.  Ruebusch mentioned that he sees McGregor living on his chin and his power and he'll probably do that a bit but we can't overestimate how much of that was done to show he's got the right stuff to be where he is.  He'll probably smart up a lot with Aldo and may show and improved takedown defense. He's got the time to do it and it would be foolhardy not to, but on the other hand I see him being overconfident enough to let that issue and the stance one go by til they bring him down badly."
martialarts,3da1ul,Little_Johnny20,3,Tue Jul 14 18:46:32 2015 UTC,"I think it would be a bad decision for Aldo not to try to take McGregor down. It's such an advantage for him. After how easily Mendes passed McGregor's guard, Aldo is gonna tear right through it.   I wouldn't count on McGregor fighting smarter. He's not gonna do that until someone hurts him. Even then, he might not stop coming forward. With his offensive skillset, he still might be able to beat everyone in the division, but he's gonna make the fights a lot harder than they have to be for sure."
martialarts,3da1ul,Little_Johnny20,3,Tue Jul 14 19:37:47 2015 UTC,"It would be a bad decision, no doubt about that, but there are also other considerations, including the simple fact he may want to prove he can beat McGregor on his feet.  I know it sounds deeply unstrategic but there are also other factors involved here, including big egos.  It's true he may not smart up but then, he's not a dumb guy by any means, still I have to give it to you that he may not want to change something that has worked for him til now just because somebody else tells him to.  In boxing terms you could see him a bit like a flurrier, who has a relatively high output and a good chin, but no boxer can sustain that style for too long due to the grind it puts the body through.  He may eventually evolve into a smarter boxer-puncher, kinda like Weidman, but like you an Arkansan13 pointed, he loves being on the offensive way too much."
martialarts,3da1ul,Arkansan13,3,Tue Jul 14 19:49:15 2015 UTC,"I'd describe McGregor as a seek and destroy fighter at this point. Not even a pressure fighter anymore. As long as he's on the feet he's trying to walk you down and kill you. That's not the kind of thing that changes until it has to. And by the time it has to, it may be too late.  You also have to consider what it will do to him if doubt is introduced. Right now he believes he can take anything his opponent throws, so what happens the first time he gets hurt more than he expects? When you introduce doubt, does he fall apart? We don't know, and won't know until it happens, but we do know that Aldo has as good a chance of hurting him as anyone. I'd even argue a better chance than Mendes."
martialarts,3da1ul,Arkansan13,2,Tue Jul 14 19:53:38 2015 UTC,"It's a very good question, and we may see it by october if Aldo is ready. With his footwork, his timing and his experience, Aldo could humble McGregor. That's why this previous fight has set up the stage for an even more interesting duel between them."
martialarts,3da1ul,Arkansan13,2,Tue Jul 14 20:32:38 2015 UTC,"As good as McGregor looked in that fight it doesn't leave me much hope for him against Aldo, Edgar could be a tough fight too.  Quite frankly McGregor's defense is slop just by virtue of the passive things he's doing wrong. His head is too straight up, he poses after a shot from time to time. I can't prove it for sure but I have a suspicion that McGregor would crack under a high pressure ""combined arms"" approach.   If you can get someone to take the angles he leaves, establish a high priority jab, mix in the take down, then I think he's going to struggle badly. I think Aldo can do just that if he chooses too.   The fact that Mendes landed counter shots on him the way he did with his significant reach disadvantage is troubling for me.   Overall I think long term McGregor's problem is going to be that it looks like he needs to fight a very specific type of fight/s to be successful. I don't think he's going to prove to be versatile enough for that division.   Now he did impress me with a couple of things, he showed good composure from the bottom for the most part. I also really like the way he throws that snapping front kick, the chambering is very minimal and it's hard to read.  On a side note did anyone else catch him asking the ref something from the bottom? I swear I thought he was asking if it was going to be stood up."
martialarts,3da1ul,Arkansan13,3,Tue Jul 14 18:51:13 2015 UTC,"Yea I've been saying for awhile that McGregor is very open when attacking, more so than most fighters. He overextends, leaves his back foot in the bucket and admires his work. Guys who maintain their position as they fight off the back foot are going to give him huge problems, because right now he's relying on his power to drive guys back and his chin to allow him to move forward.   He's gonna beat most guys, and is definitely a top 5 fighter, but people like Aldo and Edgar should be favored over him at this point. Mendes has a very good chance at winning a rematch, Duffy and Hollaway don't have as good chances but would still be interesting rematches."
martialarts,3da1ul,Arkansan13,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:22:52 2015 UTC,I felt like what really did Mendes in was the body work Connor put in. He was just too battered down to keep up an effective work rate or defense.  If he comes back with that in mind and makes some minor adjustments I could well see him winning the rematch.

Your background is tkd? If you both train the same art an spar together outside of class just to get in more time it's not a terrible thing, the big IF being if you train the same art. It's like to bjj guys rolling at home after class. The problem arises when you start giving advice, at your level the difference in skill is minimal and an athletic guy off the street with no training could smoke both of you. The problem I see with this sparring is the emphasis on kicks, few people in reality will kick. Hands need work in both parties and you're kicking when you should be punching. If you prefer tkd that's fine but boxibg is a solid art worth checking out."

I got a few kicks in the knees, but I can't see where I did that to him? Also, if you mean him, I don't think he was trying to hurt me, just not enough control.  Ps. I'm in the dark blue hoodie, my friend is in the shorts and with the sweat band."

martialarts,3db4t4,user079,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:54:46 2015 UTC,"It's probably a marketing thing. BJJ is more popular than judo in a lot of places and it's akin to using buzzwords on a product to attract a larger market. It's not factually incorrect, judo groundwork has commonalities with Bjj even if there are strategy differences. I wouldn't discount their judo just because of this, if they actually teach some Bjj it will give you a better ground game than most judoka."

I'd say if it gets much hotter than that in there you'll need to change up some things.  For example if you're the kind of place that insists on gi and other uniforms, consider having a few shorts and tshirt days until the weather cools down a bit.  Maybe slow things down a bit with some Chi Sao or One Step, or switch the schedule around a bit so that each kid has a bit longer to drink some water and cool down a bit.  Even just some of the cheapest fans can make an immense difference.  Keep in mind that if it's 85 or 90 degree in the place while it's empty, if you put that many kids in there the real temperature might be between 95 or 100.  Lots of people being active outputs a lot of heat.  You could even try something like buckets of ice with water bottles in it placed in front of a fan so that the cool air gets circulated."

If your goal is to escape (and with multiple attackers, it probably should be), then practicing footwork and angles that minimize the advantage that multiple opponents have against you and that tries to avoid incoming force isn't a bad thing.  The first title in the video refers to it as ""basic strategy"", and he refers to it as a ""simple exercise we use to practice moving"".  He employs very few actual ""techniques"", just a lot of intelligent footwork.  I wouldn't read too much into it, or expect too much from it."

martialarts,3d98r3,PunPuncher,17,Tue Jul 14 14:22:18 2015 UTC,"Krav Maga lacks quality control, meaning that there is a big tent of krav maga practices out there ranging from intense, effective training for law enforcement to very poor ""McDojo"" training.  The problem is that krav maga is often marketed aggressively and it's hard to tell-even if you're an experienced martial artist--what form of training you are going to be receiving until you've already forked over 6 months in advance.  That's why many of us in this sub recommend adding krav maga to a ""base"" style like boxing, judo, BJJ, wrestling, or muay thai. Once you have learned how to fight full-contact and are used to sparring against people actively fighting back, you will be in an excellent position to examine a krav maga studio and determine what you could gain from it. Dudes dripping sweat and screaming while kneeing pads in the ""balls"" will seem less impressive than quality light technical sparring with basic takedowns or roleplaying drills involving various self-defense scenarios.  Most often the value of krav maga training isn't learning combat moves as much as learning a mentality of how to deal with life-and-death situations and how to frame different self-defense scenarios. It's like common sense on steroids. Depending on your innate level of common sense and cool under pressure this can have differing levels of value. After all, you could be the best boxer in the world but if you lack common sense you could get yourself stabbed to death walking to your car in a dark garage. Will krav maga save you from such a fate? Maybe, maybe not. But doubtlessly increases the odds of survival."
martialarts,3d98r3,farkoman,12,Tue Jul 14 14:41:45 2015 UTC,"A friend of mine is a KM (only) practitioner.  Although his kickboxing, wrestling and jiu-jitsu is all pretty shit, he can go 0-100 ridiculously fast.  Only the LEOs I've rolled with in BJJ can ramp up their intensity faster, which is undoubtedly a byproduct of their profession.  I'm thinking that instant intensity is the attribute that is well-honed in krav.  The skills, not so much."
martialarts,3d98r3,mymartialartsalt,9,Tue Jul 14 15:06:25 2015 UTC,"A cop buddy of mine is actually a big krav maga fan and he says it's great for civilians for exactly that reason. He calls it ""flipping the switch"".   I'm actually ambivalent as to whether it's a good thing or not. Domestic violence is the #1 source a significant source of all violence in the US and I'm concerned about teaching people how to instantly switch into a hyperaggressive mindframe.   But obviously if you're going to be prepared for life and death confrontation you're going to need to be able to do that."
martialarts,3d98r3,farkoman,3,Tue Jul 14 15:53:33 2015 UTC,"I guess it really depends on the context you want self defence for. I live in a very peaceful area so the worst I usually have to worry about is a cranky drunk, and I don't necessarily want to cripple him if we do fight.

However, if we broaden violence from ""domestic"" vs ""non-domestic"" to ""people know each other in advance"" vs ""strangers"" we come up with more interesting statistics.  According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics study conducted in 2010, looking at years 2003 to 2007, ""Offenders were known to their victims in 65% of violent burglaries; offenders were strangers in 28%."" In homicides, a stranger committed the crime just 18% of the time, the Bureau found in a 1987 study. I don't have those links handy but I can dig them out if you like."
martialarts,3d98r3,farkoman,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:20:58 2015 UTC,"Now that is entirely believable. Most violence of all forms is done by someone the victim knows, at least knows a little (as opposed to a total stranger).   Best way to always stay safe is to be a total recluse!"

I was like, uh, this is my 50%...  Definitely agree that acceleration is more important than top speed in self-defense.  I've heard instructors talk about that as a philosophical thing, that krav defenses focus on macro actions (going for the MT plum or shoulder clinch and throwing knees/elbows) rather than precise ones (e.g. aikido-style wristlocks and throws) because you lose fine muscle control when under stress."
martialarts,3d98r3,user079,4,Tue Jul 14 16:35:49 2015 UTC,"He probably wasn't thinking that you were going 100%, but letting you go even 50% is risky if he's not sure of your abilities yet. A lot of novices come into Bjj and judo schools and try to do the moves they've been shown as fast as they can and with as much force as they can because they don't know any better. This leads to lack of control and risk of injury to their partner. It takes a bit of time for a coach/sensei/instructor to assess you even if you have prior experience and is why you may have been asked to tone it down a little."
martialarts,3d98r3,castle9mm,3,Wed Jul 15 06:41:14 2015 UTC,"I would concur.  It's like an 80-20 rule (at least for beginners) 20% technique, 80% aggression & mentality.  And for most of the population, for self-defense context, that's all they need.    Once you start progressing though, it becomes more fine-tuning, how to handle trained fighters rather than just street bandits.  (My school, for example, requires at least a blue belt in BJJ, before passing beyond KM3).  It's kinda backwards from a lot of martial arts.  Doesn't make it good or bad...just different (excluding the mcDojos and shitty instructors popping up)"
martialarts,3d98r3,castle9mm,3,Tue Jul 14 16:42:22 2015 UTC,Most often the value of krav maga training isn't learning combat moves as much as learning a mentality of how to deal with life-and-death situations and how to frame different self-defense scenarios.   Very well said.  Krav Maga doesn't have any secret sauce.  The techniques all derive from other martial arts.  But the mentality is what I believe sets it apart.   I've used an analogy before as KM being those alcohol-burning dragsters...A to B as quickly and violently as possible.
martialarts,3d98r3,RevBendo,10,Tue Jul 14 16:33:07 2015 UTC,"My only real qualm with Krav Maga is that there doesn't seem to be any such thing as a proportional response. It reminds me of that video that was posted a couple weeks ago of the guy defending against someobe pointing his finger at him.   This is great if you're in law enforcement, or live in a place where every guy who approaches you on the street could be a suicide bomber. But I'm not sure for the average person ingraining that kind of explosive violence into themselves is the best training. Like it or not, we live in a litigious society, and responding to a guy who has had too much to drink and gives you a light shove my breaking his face, arm and leg could very easily end up with you in jail or court.   The big thing I DO like about Krav Maga is the full speed training. This is the biggest thing a lot of traditional martial arts get wrong. If you were in a real life and death situation, having the reaction as muscle memory could save your ass. But how often does that happen? I agree with everyone else who says that if you can find a good program, take it to supplement another martial art like BJJ, judo, Muay Thai, etc."
martialarts,3d98r3,MacintoshEddie,8,Tue Jul 14 17:26:13 2015 UTC,"Not all KM places train to immediately go to throat punches.  The issue here is that a lot of people have hardons for the whole commando kill tactical krav maga and thus train as though every encounter needs to result in one of you being crippled or killed.  My instructor comes from the other side of the situation where 90% of encounters need at most a restraining technique, and many of them can be solved without any physical contact at all.  Some people seem to feel the need to be different, so they emphasize and play up Krav Maga and the aggressive style of it until it becomes a hyperbole.  You can teach a soccer mom to fight like a Navy SEAL but you are training her to go to jail.  You can train a LEO like a SEAL but you are training him to use excessive force.  You can train a SEAL like a soccer mom and he will die.  You can train a SEAL like a LEO and he will be ineffective.  Different problems call for different solutions.  There is no one perfect path to the top of the mountain, there are many paths to many mountains.  The best we can do is find the crossroads where those paths meet and diverge, so we can teach the highest percentage techniques and people can decide what path to follow from there."
martialarts,3d98r3,mattBernius,7,Tue Jul 14 18:59:34 2015 UTC,"Here's the overall rule of thumb -- generally the specific gym/program/instructor is more important than the art itself.  And everything really depends on what you have available near by. If you don't have any Krav in your area, then this discussion is moot to begin with.   I've seen Krav taught well, with a high cardio component and a lot of progressive resistant drilling and sparring. Generally speaking, thats what you should look for. There are also a lot of places that teach it poorly.  If there is a specific school you are looking at, and they have a website, I suggest posting it here. There are enough KM people on /r/MartialArts to give you an evaluation of that program.  It's also good to look at the general fitness level of most people in the class. If most folks are out of shape, then that's going to tell you a lot about the ""exercise"" value of the class.  As far as Krav versus Brazilian Jui Jitsu (BJJ) and other grappling programs -- there are places for each in self defense. The advantage of grappling training is that (a) you do a lot of constant progressive resistance training, which makes it a good workout and means your constantly learning to deal with a resisting opponent, and (b) it gives you self defense options that don't require you to beat the other person into a pulp to control the situation (handy when dealing with good-people-having-bad-days and friends/family members).  The key thing is to find a school that you enjoy training at."

Obsession with self defense is something that I've come to consider creepy and weird.  Many schools seem to foster a worldview of paranoia about getting jumped by like 5 masked dudes.  Reminds me a lot of those home-defense focused gun mags that promote the idea that some random bad guys are going to break into your house, steal your kids to sell into slavery, set fire to your dog and totally don't mind getting in a gun fight with you over it.  My bias on the issue is that I do BJJ.  Although the BJJ community has it's own issues, people are way more focused on athletic and skill development than on application role-playing.  It's by far the best workout of any martial art that I've done, it's practical for self dense and, best of all, doesn't force me to consider my mortality every time I go train.  The strength of BJJ as a training method is that most of it takes the form of just having fun wrestling with your friends."

martialarts,3d98r3,SirPunchy,5,Tue Jul 14 22:33:16 2015 UTC,"Krav Maga can be worth it.  It all comes down to how the instructor teaches it and what they emphasize.  The way I see it now, if the KM instructor is willing to bring in specialists for a class that is a very good sign.  KM is a generalist system, it focuses on everything, striking and grappling while standing or prone, unarmed or weapons, escapes, controls, neutralization, against single or multiple threats.  A KM person will almost never be better at any one thing than a specialist, which is where crosstraining and bringing in outside talent shines.  A Jiu-jitsu master who spent ten years mastering his art may be able to teach you the fundamentals of what he learned in a single day, it would be foolish to pass up that opportunity.  A boxer could spend a day teaching you about things that it took him twenty years in the ring to understand.  Where KM really stands out is teaching people how to change the rules of engagement.  You'll learn just enough of everything so that you're never out of your depth, never in unexplored territory.    Just keep in mind not to mistake intensity or speed for reality.  Look at the intent and the result.  My rule of thumb is that good techniques are effective at any speed.  I can very slowly and gracefully pop my knee into the back of yours and knock you over just as well as I could if I give it my all and try to take your leg off.  If I'm screaming and frothing at the mouth and hammering your knee three times a second and you're just standing there awed by my intensity, my technique sucks even if it looked ""real"" due to intensity.  The difference is that high speed you may very well suffer a torn ligament, or a dislocated joint, and at slow speed you can train it with less injury.  The longer I do this the more I see that good martial arts is easy and not very impressive looking.  Like ridiculously easy using two fingers to shift someone's center of gravity just enough that they lose balance.  It's not two cage fighters screaming and throwing themselves at eachother for ten minutes, it's one of them being behind the other guy with a headlock and a knee in the spine two seconds in."
martialarts,3d9hss,MsInternet,5,Tue Jul 14 15:32:05 2015 UTC,"If you are in a sparsely populated area of the US, you may have few options, as most karate and TKD will be geared for kids and folks looking to learn some flashy moves.   Try broadening your search to other styles as well. For example, judo tends to have excellent quality control and is often pretty inexpensive. Same with boxing.  If you insist on karate look for a school that has a good sparring program, as sparring tends to be a decent form of quality control in and of itself. Certainly schools that never spar should be avoided. Kyokushin is a style that usually has excellent sparring, so if that's available, it's likely good."
martialarts,3d9hss,farkoman,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:14:42 2015 UTC,"I actually just looked at all the dojos, ignoring the styles and mostly looking for my best option for good teaching. It was between this karate dojo, and a judo dojo, but the judo dojo seemed much more..philisophocal and less focused on self defense. It was even more robotic than where I am now. I'm not sure if there's absolutely no sparring at the dojo I'm at, but I haven't seen it happen and I'm a little embarrassed to ask in case they really dont. The closest I've seen to sparring is the higher ranked belts going through the motions of sparring, but not actually using any kind of force behind it."

Judo is almost always legit. It's one of those arts where McDojos are pretty rare.  What were your impressions? Please describe what you saw at the judo place.
martialarts,3d9hss,SVPPB,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:26:02 2015 UTC,"I went to their class to watch 2 or 3 times, but they just kind of stood in place and did the same moves over and over. There wasn't any warming up, either. The entire hour of class was just them standing in the same spot while the instructor barked commands. But, maybe this is a normal thing. I didn't really know what to look for when I was watching classes. But that's what turned me away, I needed a place with a good cardio warm up and such to help get me in shape."
martialarts,3d9hss,farkoman,4,Tue Jul 14 16:29:52 2015 UTC,"I went to their class to watch 2 or 3 times, but they just kind of stood in place and did the same moves over and over.   That sounds a bit unusual. Static drills (uchikomi) are a big part of judo, but they should be combined with more dynamic stuff.   An average judo class looks something like this:  Warmup (possibly breakfall practice, especially if there are new people. At my club we often warm up by doing ground fighting sparring).   Drills - sometimes uchikomi, sometimes a specific throw, or combinations, or counters, or a ground fighting technique.  Semi-live training - relatively free drills with resistance, like turtle turnovers, guard passing, or a specific entry for a throw.  Sparring - a few minutes of standing randori with full resistance.  In my experience, most clubs don't devote all that much time to conditioning, because judo itself is an excellent workout. Serious competitors get their conditioning outside of class time."
martialarts,3d9hss,SVPPB,3,Tue Jul 14 17:59:31 2015 UTC,Judo should follow a standard curriculum and there should be sparring practically every class. If not it may not actually be judo.  Do you have  link?

I'd email the Oklahoma Judo Association and ask them for a recommendation. Looking at recent tournament results should also help you locate a competitive club. Or just email the OJA and ask them what's available near you. You could also ping them on Facebook.  http://www.okjudo.org

martialarts,3d9hss,mattBernius,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:38:28 2015 UTC,to be fair my judo instructors were teaching because they wanted to and had other careers. The people at that other judo place might be doing it professionally. I pay 150 for unlimited bjj and my instructor is teaching bjj as his career (coupled with the fact that rent in a major california city is likely higher than it may be in oklahoma).   in general the places I have paid >100 were at schools that either had high rent issues and/or an instructor/owner doing it as a career
martialarts,3d9hss,the_seventh_note,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:55:11 2015 UTC,"Well when I talked to them, they claimed they all had other jobs and taught voluntarily on the side for no money. And they weren't lacking in students, either. I'd imagine they make more than what you can call non profit. :/ I just don't really trust that place now, especially since 2 other people said they don't look very authentic. I'll try for another judo place that seems more legit."

But I haven't really noticed any progress in that category. I'd start lifting, but they don't have weights at this dojo."

Hard truth: Very few martial arts programs will provide noticable strength gains or weight loss on their own.   Programs with a high degree of cardio work or constant resistant training against heavy weight will be your best best. But you still need to participate in multiple classes a week to see those gains.  If you are looking to ""get in shape,"" honestly, martial arts are not your best bet. And even if they are your preferred method and you're doing something like boxing or BJJ, you still really need to do supplemental exercises."
martialarts,3d9hss,MacintoshEddie,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:57:56 2015 UTC,"Thank you. They do have a nice cardio routine, just not much strength training what with no weights and stuff like that. I usually go to class 3 times a week, on the days I don't go I'll look into buying a couple of my own weights and such to take up for the lack. Luckily, I'm not looking for much weight loss. It's more about getting toned, but not bulging with muscle. So hopefully I won't have to spend much on home equipment for that."

Salesmen who are confident in their product will know that they can make a sale after a customer has sampled the product.  After all, would you buy a car from a dealership that refused to let you test drive it or even sit inside it?  Another sign is if there is no resistant training, no ""aliveness"".  If you could replace your training partner with a mannequin and nothing would change that is a bad sign.  A very bad sign is if they charge more money the longer you've been there.  The exception is if more equipment such as shin guards and whatnot become necessary as you progress and the costs of those are built into the fee.  Secret squirrel mystical kung fu is an indicator of a McDojo.

martialarts,3dakxr,nihilist-ego,4,Tue Jul 14 19:59:34 2015 UTC,"Play with them.  A lot.  Double spinning weapons like tonfa or nunchaku or sai are very different than long poking weapons like spear, staff, or sword.  They are short range, infighting tools, and you must adjust your tactics to match.  Make sure you get a good set that has a large knob for spinning.  Too many cheap sets have a skinny knob at the handle, and you won't feel comfortable loosening your grip the way you need to.  Have fun, and expect a long learning curve."
martialarts,3dakxr,hrafnar,2,Wed Jul 15 15:53:45 2015 UTC,"I agree, play with them and spin them around. I picked up tonfa as the second weapon in kobudo training after a lot of time with bo staff. As others have said this not a practical weapon at all. Your not going to carry tonfa around or find a reasonable approximation of it laying around. But it is fun, just to learn something new, have a new mental and physical challenge. Swing them around, a lot. Take big swings, since it is a flailing weapon. I also agree about the larger knob, these are usually found on the traditional Okinawan style."

It's most likely a new context for you to apply and use your empty hand training and that's fine but people start with weapobs from day 1 in some arts and learn the true meaning if weapon mastery."
martialarts,3dakxr,Vennificus,4,Tue Jul 14 23:16:53 2015 UTC,"As a longswordsman, I'd counter that argument. Tonfa are unique in the weapons world (well, almost unique) in that they don't necessarily improve your reach and they have terrible leverage when they do BUT Being able to use your unarmed style to block weapons is hella useful and being made of wood it might be an ideal closing weapon, which, surprise surprise, is where it excels.   There's a lot of weapons like that that I'd hate to go against. Sais, any type of wooden shield, Jitte, or long chain weapons. Have you ever tried to pull a sword out of a piece of wood? It's not hard but it takes time, and time is super precious in combat. Especially when you can still be hit by your foe  Weapons are built for contexts. The tonfa IS an improvised weapon but I can see it being a successful one. It is essentially a skinny shield.  edit: Almost unique in that some shields serve similar roles and that the thai have a similar one, the Mai Sok San IIRC"
martialarts,3dakxr,42life,3,Wed Jul 15 05:13:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think he's arguing about the plausibility of tonfa as a weapon. I think he's arguing that OP learning a weapon in general is redundant because cough most likely no one in their establishment is a ""master"" of the weapon but has only dabbled in it as a part of a kata. As a result, regardless of whether or not OP learns the weapon he can not wield it."
martialarts,3dakxr,Vennificus,2,Wed Jul 15 05:18:46 2015 UTC,This just means there's a better reason for cross training
martialarts,3dakxr,Docholiday888,2,Wed Jul 15 05:23:33 2015 UTC,"That's what I was getting at, I suspect there are very few that put in the time necessary to master the tonfa. Doing a kata with a tonfa isn't the same as in depth study from day one of your martial arts training. Sure they're cool to learn, but I doubt most instructirs have the knowledge to really teach the weapon well. As for my useless comment I meant for self defense. Martial arts weapons are cool but if you ever actually use one in defense you're going to be under a lot of legal scrutiny."
martialarts,3dakxr,Vennificus,2,Wed Jul 15 14:21:02 2015 UTC,"My favorite part about the tonfas is the ability to swing the longer part around, giving you more range. The cool part is that you can do this very fast so they don't know how you are going to attack with until it's in motion. Also insanely fun doing my regular unarmed katas with them in my hands, since unarmed skills translate very well."
martialarts,3dakxr,ichneumon,2,Wed Jul 15 05:36:22 2015 UTC,"Almost as fun as having two edges. I like the Tonfa for its compact mobility, It has one of the smallest profiles for weapons in its reach range because of that forearm grip."
martialarts,3dakxr,Docholiday888,2,Wed Jul 15 05:43:23 2015 UTC,Mae sawk is quite similar to tonfa just heavier build and no rotation. I really enjoy training with it and I would not want to fight against it. You can protect yourself quite well with them and they do a ton of damage vs an unarmored opponent. In the krabi krabong context they are usually an addition to a muay thai skill set which adds to the nastiness.
martialarts,3dakxr,Docholiday888,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:57:39 2015 UTC,"I am confused by what you mean with ""true weapon."" Last time I checked the Tonfas were a martial arts weapon just like the Bo Staff, Sais, etc."
martialarts,3dakxr,Docholiday888,5,Wed Jul 15 00:32:45 2015 UTC,"Sorry, please let me clarify. I do not mean that tonfa are not a true weapon. I was referring to true weapon arts, as in arts that focus on the weapon. Or arts where the primary focus is the weapon, like arma and European sword arts, or the filipino arts. In these arts the weapon is the main focus not empty hand. The training of an art that only includes the weapon at advanced levels can rarely match the training of an art that introduces the weapon at day one."
martialarts,3dakxr,Cheeselolmo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:22:16 2015 UTC,"Well. They certainly aren't useless, I've tried them now and they are great for the ability to switch between short to medium range attacks and defensive to offensive quickly. I'm probably not going to be sparring against anyone using a sword and shield, lmao, mostly bo staffs because they seem to be the most popular, so I think I'm good."
martialarts,3dakxr,giantstonegoat,3,Wed Jul 15 05:07:47 2015 UTC,"I meant useless for self defense. As I mentioned in my above comment, using a specialized martial arts weapon to defend yourself is going to bring a lot of legal scrutiny. There are better weapons for self defense like a blade or gun. I'm not sure you can legally use a weapon to defend yourself in a less than lethal encounter, the general rule with weapons use is that you must justify that you were in fear of losing your life. If you like them fine, enjoy it. Just know that your training is most likely lacking compared to an art that teaches the weapon from day one."

So much pressure."
martialarts,3dbf6y,SirPunchy,5,Wed Jul 15 03:28:59 2015 UTC,"""Real world self defense"" is something everybody wants and everyone claims to offer. The best self defense system is to take up running.   You would be well served by either judo or BJJ, although I'm more partial to judo since it has a better standing game.

That's great and but doesn't need to influence your selection of martial art unless you want it to. You can be into yoga and meditation and enjoy shooting guns from pickup trucks and there's really no issue there.   I will only use this for self defense.   Laudable, but you may need to practice in other contexts in order to realize this goal.   I have tried aikido as it appears like a good match for my interests.   Don't conflate interests and goals.   It was fun and it looked useful, but not sure how useful it will be in me protecting myself.    You are wise to be skeptical.   Actually all MA in general seem so rehearsed i wonder how i will actually protect myself even after practicing them.    You are looking for ""aliveness"". Google it. It's the antidote to this problem.   Do you have to practice for years, and practice 'real' sparring for your training to be useful?    No. You should be getting better every day. In a few months, you should be significantly more prepared than you were with no training at all.   Would Judo or BJJ be a good match? Im definately not looking to compete, but for this to be real world self defense.   Judo and BJJ are both superb choices. If you do choose to compete, however, you will dramatically increase your chances of being prepared to use your skills in a ""real"" fight since you will have tested your techniques under pressure."

Good Aikido (assuming a good teacher) involves a great deal of situational awareness training, which is the first line of defense in any potential conflict. If you are interested in practical self defense, a general class will not often lend itself to 'nuts and bolts' combat training. Talk to the teacher in the class about your interest, as He (or She) may be able to show you some more practical strike counters, take down defenses, and evasion techniques. If not, find a self-defense type class with a reputable instructor, your teacher may have a referral."

martialarts,3d8hh5,johnnytai,2,Tue Jul 14 14:43:29 2015 UTC,I change my stances alot so I am comfy with either side. I'm also very comfortable with lateral movements/attacks. Though if I throw spining back fist/kick it's always the right- have to work on that one...it's becoming too predictable.
martialarts,3d8hh5,Carlos13th,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:42:18 2015 UTC,I fight orthodox and I am right handed I do switch on occasion but that's usually just a quick switch to throw a strike (usually a left kick) or two then return to standard stance. Even though in grappling it is normally recommended with your strong side forward I grapple in a similar stance as I want to to be able to grapple from my fighting stance.
martialarts,3d8hh5,storm80error,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:40:12 2015 UTC,"Similar to you, im right handed but always start off southpaw. In doing so I improve my left punches and kicks.

martialarts,3d6m2m,chazzbass,6,Tue Jul 14 01:17:04 2015 UTC,"From experience this is more or less true...to a point.  Hard to say how far other people can be willing to go.    The first event I called someone out for being unnecessarily rude to an elderly man.  Said jerk turns their attention towards me and calls me a bitch which then prompted another woman to come to my defense.  Eventually someone flagged the driver who basically told everyone to shut it which was just fine by me.  Second event this drunk man was being really rude and belligerent to this couple.  Had earbuds in so didn't hear what was going on but could see them getting distressed.  I ended up taking the earbuds out and asking the man to leave them alone.  This again led to the drunk turning on me.  Elderly man tried to step in, threatened to push the call button at which point the drunk started daring him to and saying more shit.  This leads to the man actually getting up and leaving to another area.  That was as far as he was willing to involve himself which is perfectly acceptable as it wasn't a fun situation and you can never tell with a drunk but I was in too deep to walk away and didn't really want to at that point.  It didn't go further then the guy making threats as I was able to use my dry sarcasm to try and be humorous and defuse things.  It thankfully worked and the couple were more or less left in peace for the remainder of the ride as the drunk seemed to gain respect for me standing up to him and spent the rest of the ride regretfully trying to either get to know me or impress me with his $3,000 bracelet he couldn't stop talking about.  All I wanted to do was watch a documentary on my phone in peace -_-  As for the post itself, I can't imagine.  My experiences are all mundane with just rude belligerent people.  It's still a frightening/intimidating situation.  I've interceded in situations where I didn't think I was in real danger.  Hard to know what I'd do in an event that can lead to real harm.  I'm trying to not think about it and just hope that I can just enjoy life as I am, not fuck it up too much, and live right without getting myself killed.  Got enough shit I'm terrified and worried about as is.  Mortality is some pretty scary shit in and of itself."

martialarts,3d6m2m,Braggadouchio,5,Tue Jul 14 04:58:55 2015 UTC,It seems to be that the best response in this situation would be to hit the emergency button.  It doesn't really put you at risk and can deescalate a potentially violent incident.   This was an interesting article though.  I like that the writer had the balls to be honest about what she would or wouldn't have done if she was a bystander.  Also it gets us thinking about what we would do in such a situation.  I don't think we can ever really know until we're actually in that situation but thinking about it ahead of time can help us prepare to take the correct action (whatever you decide that is for you).  I think a major reason no one did anything was because they were probably so shocked/scared/surprised at seeing something like this that they didn't know how to respond and just froze.

Each carrying its own modifier into the situation. Still, I could try. It's sad to think about, but while I would (like everyone else) like to think I'd help, how the hell would I know since I've never been in that situation?"
martialarts,3d6m2m,Mournclaw,3,Tue Jul 14 03:51:56 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much how I've always looked at these potential situations. If they're starting the fight, why? The only answer is they have some reason to believe they'll win, a weapon, physical size/strength, maybe martial arts training of their own or they simply aren't thinking that far ahead do to drugs/emotional problems/mental illness. I don't think a stone cold sober guy who's unarmed, not insane or angry and happens to be 120lbs is gonna start shit. Same guy, but emotionally unstable and possibly with a weapon, that's a problem."

martialarts,3d6m2m,ConvertsToMetric,3,Tue Jul 14 05:55:56 2015 UTC,"Having a group of people around can often reduce your chances of getting help when you ask for it.      Don't call for help. Demand help from a specific person. ""You, the guy in the red jacket, I'm in danger, help me!"" The bystander effect is caused by everyone thinking ""I don't know if this person really needs or wants help, and there is probably someone here more qualified to help than I am."" No guarantees, but it should make it better. And it helps to ask a guy for help, if you can, as men tend to be more willing to get physical (yay, testosterone).   This pattern of findings is consistent with the arousal-cost-reward model, which proposes that dangerous emergencies are recognized faster and more clearly as real emergencies, thereby inducing higher levels of arousal and hence more helping.   Hitting the emergency alarm basically does that for you. It says to the conductor or security guard or whatever authority figure there is around, ""Hey, you! I actually need help and it is your job."""

He won but he showed some glaring errors, spotty take down defense and a bad tendency to sit up right after his punches, poor striking defense in general.  In fact after seeing that fight I'm less convinced of his ability to deal with Aldo. The reach/height gap is smaller, and Aldo is a much more versatile striker. I also suspect that we will see what Aldo has to offer wrestling wise, the smart move would to using the takedown to upset McGregors rhythm and deny the kick."

martialarts,3d7o3g,baserace,8,Tue Jul 14 03:53:47 2015 UTC,"Judo and Jujitsu are supposedly very child friendly. It'll burn a lot of energy if they take it seriously and with competent instruction they're pretty solid against striking arts because they're largely geared towards putting someone in a position where they can't fight back due to being either pinned on the ground or restrained via joint lock. The big thing to worry about with any grappling art though would be making sure that they understand that they can seriously hurt someone. An arm lock isn't like a punch to the face, for some damn reason I've had full grown adults look at grappling and doubt its potential to harm someone. As a guy currently nursing an injured shoulder from rolling with friends who wouldn't just snap my arm, I'd say grappling and submission techniques need to be taught to someone who understands the weight of potentially using them in self defense. I'm not a guy with kids and I certainly don't know yours, so ultimately it's your call, but I'd say maybe a mature 10 year old could take up grappling and be competent for their age by their teens."

Not training wrestling is the #1 regret if you ask martial artists."

The sort of protracted grappling and clinching seen in wrestling, shuai jiao, and Judo is absent.  It's also a kickboxing style with takedowns, not a full mixed ruleset. It completely lacks the ground game, and wrestlers learn how to establish position like no others."

I didn't know that! /s  I'm talking about Wrestling takedowns obviously, they're all in Sanda. I use Judo throws in Sanda successfully too. Ofcourse there are things in Wrestling that are not in Sanda, but I'm saying that they are not lost forever just because you don't do wrestling in high school / college. Judo, BJJ, Sanda and MMA places cover these things well.  Really sorry if I'm coming off as rude or mean-spirited, I'm in a bad mood and it's nothing personal."
martialarts,3d7o3g,Grarvindur,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:04:03 2015 UTC,"I'm talking about Wrestling takedowns obviously   This is where you're wrong. There is nothing obvious about you only talking about the takedowns. Where, in the thread to which you were responding, was wrestling mentioned expressly for its takedowns? It was mentioned as something kids should train because they have access to it, and that includes all of it and all of its benefits. Anything else, limiting it to a takedown comparison or what have you, is moving the goal posts.  They're part of the game, but fighting for top position, and the pin, is a huge part of wrestling, and both the methods they use and the intensity with which they train (in the US, where wrestling is tied into the school system at high school and collegiate levels) makes its practitioners absolute beasts. Even including those takedowns in Sanda, or the takedowns and top position in MMA, doesn't really compare to intensely training them at a competition level. There simply isn't time for it, unless you're literally training full-time.  As to why I explain things you already know about arts you already practice:  1) You often ignore things about those arts that are readily apparent, viewing them through a filtered lens that supports exclusively your viewpoint and ignores anything about them that supports others. This is normal; confirmation bias is a thing and we're all guilty of it at times.  2) Not everyone reading this thread is going to know everything you know and it's good for the conversation to remain accessible.  3) I don't necessarily know the scope of what you know, and I value ensuring that I'm not misunderstood.

I haven't read the whole thread, I'm simply arguing with his reasoning that once you have graduated college, there are some things you can never learn and you've missed it forever.  Again, as I said to this idiot, I know that you train wrestling more intensively when it's ONLY about wrestling. Just like you will train punches more intensively at a boxing gym, bjj more intensively at one of those gyms, compared to doing everything at MMA etc.  However, you can still learn these useful aspects in other places. Judo, Sanda and MMA all have either variations of these aspects or the complete thing (MMA). In MMA you are most likely splitting your time doing different kinds of things and as such don't get as big of an emphasis on it as an all-wrestling place where you only do wrestling.   I follow you here, but it's completely up to you how much focus you put on it, and I don't buy his nonsense that ""WRESTLING IS JUST SUPERIOR"" and other competitive grappling, like Judo, is dog shit in comparision.   You often ignore things about those arts that are readily apparent, viewing them through a filtered lens that supports exclusively your viewpoint and ignores anything about them that supports others.   Not true though, I just expect him to know what I'm talking about. I really overestimated his knowledge, sorry for that.

martialarts,3d7o3g,Grarvindur,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:24:18 2015 UTC,"Wrestling was suggested at the top level. You then suggested Sanda as an alternative if one misses out on wrestling. The one point is that Sanda is not an alternative for wrestling because it lacks over half of what makes wrestling compelling and worthwhile. You are trying to defend your comment by shifting the goal posts so that having the takedowns available, even if they're not necessarily trained, is justification enough.  The bigger point is that, if you go through school in the US without practicing wrestling, you've missed out on a tremendous opportunity not just with regard to the art itself, but the environment in which it's trained. No one's saying you can't find other places that train wrestling or incorporate wrestling techniques, but few of them will have the kind of focus on them that wrestling in school does.  More to the point, the intensity of practice, and the freedom of one's schedule to pursue that with such a focus, to spend so much of one's time on other things that complement and support the development of one's wrestling skills, is generally just not there. Such are the travails of adult life.  EDIT: It's worth noting that Cung Le, one of the most dominant Sanda fighters of all time, was at the time combining TKD and wrestling. His wrestling training allowed him to outstrip long-term Sanda-trained fighters."

You train them though? Not sure what you mean. I've been using Sanda to say that it's an example of where you can learn some of these skills after college. Never said they do everything, I was specifically talking about takedowns in my first comment and I thought that was obvious since, you know, I was talking about Sanda.   I used MMA as an example of where they train everything, and the focus is as big as you make it. It's definitely very competitive.   Then I added that Judo is a great alternative and he said it's just worse generally, which I argued with.   The bigger point is that, if you go through school in the US without practicing wrestling, you've missed out on a tremendous opportunity not just with regard to the art itself, but the environment in which it's trained   I've addressed this in the last comment.   It's worth noting that Cung Le, one of the most dominant Sanda fighters of all time, was at the time combining TKD and wrestling. His wrestling training allowed him to outstrip long-term Sanda-trained fighters.   Cung Le started with these because there weren't any Sanda available to him at first. I'm sure it helped him just like Judo and TKD is helping me though.  Tbh Sanda kicks very much resemble Taekwondo kicks (for the most part), and the wrestling takedowns are identical. The transition is very smooth. It's basically a hybrid martial art."
martialarts,3d7o3g,Grarvindur,2,Wed Jul 15 01:37:58 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter which martial art, you should just pick a good school with a good teacher who knows what he's doing with your child.  As far as age goes, 6 years old is the minimum, in my opinion. At this age children start developing enough coordination, balance and ""perceptive"" abilities to be able to learn complex movements.  From 6 to 14 years old there should be no big difference between ""striking"" and ""non-striking"". The thing is that ""martial arts"" for kids is not really ""martial"". I'd feel irresponsible it I taught a kid how to do an arm-bar or how to break someone's liver. It's all propaedeutic exercise to develop general coordination and balance skills, give a better sense of discipline and improve their ""psychological"" abilities. This is achieved in different ways, depending on the instructor, usually exploiting movements from an actual martial arts but without teaching applied techniques.  It really just depends from the actual activities rather than the martial art that the adult teacher is studying. In the end it's the kid that should choose what he finds more entertaining."
martialarts,3d7o3g,martialarthritis,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:30:08 2015 UTC,if its available in your area...capoeira. Its a great art for youngers. There are songs they have to learn instruments they can play the art itself is practiced as a dance but its quite potent when seriously applied.

The usefulness in a street fight is not necessarily the meter of usefulness one should apply in a selecting a martial art for a child. Karate, TKD, Aikido....the biggest advantages these arts give their younger students is confidence....not combat readiness.   One of the reasons I recommend capoeira for youngsters is that the dynamic movement, flexibility, agility, balance, and sense of body that it fosters is a set of skills that children are uniquely equipped to excel at.     Now that aside, I must say that capoeira uses a training technique that is hard for many to understand...the dance. People often fail to understand the skill and control required to execute an acrobatic kick WITHOUT taking your opponents head off is exactly the skill need to ensure that when you have to....you can. But that people are most accustomed to seeing these shadow matches....gives a false impression that there isnt a real use. Many schools fail to provide their students with a good training in applying these sorts of techniques when they arent squared off against another capoeira student. but again...a failing of many arts."

Also let me just clarify, the skill involved in capoeira is huge. I understand that, I have dabbled in it and just the other week me and one of the other senior students where doing the dance (spar, whatever haha) and you are right... takes a lot of control to be that fluid in movement without busting heads.   What I was more getting at is how is this related into a street fight? Obviously you are not going to start doing the dance (Atleast I would not think you would) and some of the acrobatic kicks look almost dangerous... do you understand my question more now?"

Stuff like understanding bases, finding the center of gravity, probably breakfalls and getups.  Maybe fun stuff like rolls and tumbling.

I'm always interested to hear about other's ways of training such things.  One of my old teachers used to have you close your eyes and he would choose a random side of you to be on from like 7 feet away or so.  He would yell HERE and they were supposed to open their eyes and try to react as well as possible instantly when they open their eyes.  It might not work if it's too quiet though and they hear you walk around.  But basically, after you get punched things get heightened.  Adrenaline rushes, heartrate rises, tunnel vision kicks in, etc.  You might black out for a second when you get punched, or get slightly dizzy.  You might be under the influence of something, or feel that way at least.  You might turn around and only have a split moment to react without being able to back up or move sideways.

martialarts,3d0vkx,darthturtle3,6,Sun Jul 12 18:30:53 2015 UTC,They know full well that without grappling they couldn't compete in MMA.

In reply to it just looks like kickboxing Alan posted this   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NUigEoyP0E&ab_channel=AlanOrrWingChunAcademy  I will let you decide if you feel his argument is correct or not.  Ive never trained with these guys myself but they are one of the few Wing Chun groups I have seen that I would genuinely like to try and train under. Not sure if it would be as effective than just training MMA elsewhere but it would still be interesting to try.   Personally for me its just nice to see guys from an art that generally doesn't spar or compete doing things differently and testing what they do. I always like to see people approaching things differently to the norm. That's why I have a level of respect for anyone who steps up and tests what they are training even if they lose.
martialarts,3d0vkx,mattBernius,6,Sun Jul 12 18:44:34 2015 UTC,"Alan Orr is a WC concepts guy. At least that's how I see it. He's far more about taking the idea behind things in forms rather than taking the movements literally. Honestly I feel like his approach is a solid one.   This is how we were taught in my JKD club, tan sao wasn't literally ""hold your hand like this"" for us it was ""it's this kind of movement"". Even when my instructor was teaching WC classes things were taken very liberally and we always had a ""if it serves the same function it's the same technique"" approach. His WC classes were structured around drilling and sparring, chi sao was done as a warm up and forms were taught strictly after class as an extra curricular thing.  I think one of the problem in CMA these days (likely this has been something of an issue since day one) is that people have gotten so divorced from fighting that they have started taking every movement in a form literally. I don't think it works that way, I think you get some things that are fairly literal and a lot of things that are concepts shown in an esoteric fashion. It's not the most direct pedagogical method but I also don't think that endless form practice was ever meant to be a primary teaching method. Over the years I have come across a few references to CMA guys of the 10's and 20's saying that the ""old timers"" of their day claimed that they didn't practice much forms."
martialarts,3d0vkx,darthturtle3,5,Sun Jul 12 21:02:36 2015 UTC,"I think of it this way: a fight is a messy thing.  It's dynamic and the opponent is adapting to you just as much as you are adapting to your opponent.  It makes learning difficult and it's hard to base your training on it.  A static form lets you work out and integrate theory into actual movement, but it loses meaning if the theory is divorced from reality.  So yeah I agree with you, testing it is very important."
martialarts,3d0vkx,mattBernius,2,Mon Jul 13 08:32:43 2015 UTC,"I mean, CMAs were create in a completely different time and place, designed to work under a different context. It makes sense that some of the movements will work for them but not for us.    If anything, the most likely thing to remain applicable in the modern day is, as you said, the underlying concept."
martialarts,3d0vkx,darthturtle3,4,Mon Jul 13 03:23:50 2015 UTC,"I mean, CMAs were create in a completely different time and place, designed to work under a different context.   While I'm a huge supporter of the need to understand context, I sometimes worry that we can also overplay that issue. Granted, context can explain why a certain approach is taken (see Ju Jistu weapon defenses which were clearly designed against committed, cleave you in two attacks executed while wearing some degree of armor).  While the arts were created for a culturally specific context, they were still dealing with interpersonal combat between people with two arms, two legs, and a head connected by a central trunk. Joints still moved in the same way, and people more or less attacked in the same way.  And if that approach doesn't work against a modern attacker with those same two arms, two legs, and a head connected by a central trunk, I think its fair to ask why? And whether the technique ever actually would have worked in the first place regardless of context."
martialarts,3d0vkx,Arkansan13,4,Mon Jul 13 15:47:58 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of what you said. Saying ""oh, X doesn't work because of context"" and leaving it at that isn't beneficial either. What should be done is thinking about the context in which X might have been used, and testing it out in as similar an environment as possible. In the end, the need for sparring is apparent, whether it's ""normal"" sparring that simulates a one-on-one conflict with striking and grappling, or ""situational"" sparring where the rules or location is somewhat modified, but freedom of action is still preserved as much as possible under that context.    There's actually an interesting tidbit when it comes to how people attacked each other in the past, and whether it's similar to what we see today. Bare-knuckle pugilism didn't see the head as an important target, for example, and most of the attacks done to the face in my style are palm strikes and backfists, instead of straight punches. But nowadays, punching people in the face directly seems to be very common."

I tend to think that untrained people have always punched people in the face. There's a pretty strong human desire to (a) punch to the face, and (b) hit the thing that is annoying you the most (i.e. the mouth).  That said, you are completely correct that most martial arts focused on big bone attacks to the head versus using one's puny and easily broken fist.  Gloves have definitely changed that focus."

Over the years with CMA when I come across something that just seems off I insert a weapon into the situation and very often it clicks. I wonder how much of TMA in general would make more sense with weapons assumed.  For instance with WC I firmly believe that the focus on trapping is due to an original assumption that the opponent would be armed and controlling the weapon hand was of paramount importance."

martialarts,3d0vkx,stultus_respectant,2,Mon Jul 13 12:02:31 2015 UTC,"Interestingly, Kyokushin takes this philosophy (in my experience). In training each of the techniques, you do them in an exaggerated, idealized way. Hooks come from behind the waist, roundhouse kicks swing all the way in from the outside.  But in practice, you're expected to learn how to use these concepts to generate power in a versatile manner. If you're farther out, a roundhouse kick might come up more linear and turn over at the last second, snapping through (clears more linear space, but would get ""jammed"" at close range). Your hands are also going to be up in a guard at all times, so punches will come from in front of the body, using the power generation methods you trained through exaggeration."
martialarts,3d0vkx,ithika,5,Mon Jul 13 22:19:45 2015 UTC,"I think what we see in many if not most Asian Martial Arts is a tendency to exaggerate to demonstrate concept.   For instance in a lot of longfist forms you'll see postures similar to this  It looks kind of odd when you see that lead arm flung back like that. But when you step back and take a look at the posture, weight thrown forward onto lead leg, driving with rear foot/leg, hips turned, lead shoulder rotated back powering a forward extension of the rear hand and all of the sudden it looks like the body mechanics for a solid cross.   So for instance in that posture linked I think you are being shown an exaggerated manner of the body mechanics for a straight right. If you follow the accompanying texts instructions and fling the lead hand backward as you step into posture it really forces everything to turn together.   Of course in application you wouldn't throw the lead arm back like that, but I think originally a decent instructor would have known that. Now a days we have guys who think that's just really how it's supposed to look so they will give some contrived explanation as to how it's all very literal.  It may not be the most direct method of transmission but I've taught guys exaggerated movements before when they were struggling with a technique, many times it will click when you say ""ok it's this, now just drop that portion of the movement""."
martialarts,3d0vkx,ithika,2,Mon Jul 13 22:38:42 2015 UTC,That kinda thing is always a problem when people only theorize but never test. Or never have people test. That's why a club that competes is great because even if you don't yourself you have people coming in who are going out and testing stuff in the wider world. Without at least testing and sparring in club you only ever have an idea of what might work bot a concrete way to find out if your assumptions and your teachers instruction is great and ever teachers who are testing stuff will make mistakes or teach something that doesn't work for you personally when the teacher and you are both not testing these things you just have no idea if it's helping.  But yeah I like Alans approach to wing chun from what I have seen.

martialarts,3d0vkx,theoldun,3,Mon Jul 13 11:47:43 2015 UTC,"The idea of sparring is to limit your tools on the same level, and see if your basics work.   Can we just copy pasta this every time we get into an argument about styles that spar v. those that don't?"
martialarts,3d0vkx,stultus_respectant,2,Mon Jul 13 16:11:51 2015 UTC,"Regarding his video explanation:  First, I've had a number of people around here outright disbelieve that chi sao can be done in an ""alive"" manner, or with resistance.  Like he says in the video, when you get to that higher level of skill and experience, you can have both of those, and can use it as a bridge into sparring.  Second, I love his explanation of the particular positions as not only not being static (the way some traditions seem to use them), but also as being ""beginner"" positions as part of learning about how to react to force, keep line of attack, stick, etc.  If you're throwing a bong sao explicitly to block punches, you're going to have a bad time.  Third, it's just great to see any WC practitioner talking about free sparring and properly testing yourself and your reactions.  It felt like only a handful of schools really dealt with this as of 10 years ago, but I think the number has grown quite a bit (seems a necessary bit of modern self-defense).  Our sparring was full pads, headgear, shin/foot protection, the works, and people would still get knocked right out with the flurries, elbows, and knees.  If there's one thing WT is good at, it's putting weight behind strikes."
martialarts,3d0vkx,darthturtle3,0,Tue Jul 14 05:58:31 2015 UTC,They know full well that without grappling they couldn't compete in MMA. I have never seen them claim anti grappling or anything of the sort.   It's the standard response.
martialarts,3d0vkx,twat69,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:47:53 2015 UTC,Do you mean anti grappling is the standard response or knowing that you cant compete without grappling is?   For people who know what they are talking about they generally admit that you cant completely avoid grappling without grappling skills. Some people however especially those who don't compete or spar think they can avoid all grappling using their non grappling art and they can learn how to avoid take downs despite no one in their class knowing how to do one.
martialarts,3d0vkx,stultus_respectant,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:10:57 2015 UTC,"No it's the standard response when anyone tries to enter a mixed martial arts competition with an unusual striking base â they get criticised for not being ""pure"". Or that they're somehow cheating by cross-training. But it's okay if someone tries MMA with a MT or Western boxing base â they don't get ill remarks for cross-training with wrestling/grappling arts."
martialarts,3d0vkx,mattBernius,2,Mon Jul 13 10:05:44 2015 UTC,"You do realize I wasn't criticizing them for not having a grappling base right? I think you may have misinterpreted me if you think that was the case. If anything I was complementing them for having a realistic idea of what their art does and doesn't cover.   I was just stating that they know Wing Chun isnt a grappling style, some Wing Chun practitioners however actually believe they can use Wing Chun to anti grapple where as these guys realize that Wing Chun doesnt cover everything.   Muay Thai couldn't compete in MMA without grappling either nor could any other pure striking style."

martialarts,3d0vkx,mattBernius,0,Mon Jul 13 10:45:41 2015 UTC,I think it was maybe a little unclear what you meant is all.   I personally love to see people try out their unique arts MMA. However it is important to know exactly what they are bringing in from that unique style and what they are getting from other arts so we can isolate what is useful from the style they are bringing in. Like for example if a Wing Chun guy who cross trains BJJ does well in MMA and people start claiming that means that Wing Chun covers ground work that claim should rightly be looked upon with suspicion.
martialarts,3d0vkx,stultus_respectant,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:50:15 2015 UTC,Interesting. I hadn't seen this one before.  I'm surprised that it hasn't been posted on the Wing Chun reddit.  I'm wondering what the reaction would be from WC guys to seeing this.

Someone approaches you with a weapon and asks for your wallet?  You give it to them.  Obviously,  if their intent is to harm you then knowing self-defense is important,  but don't expect to come out of those fights without injuries.    Basically,  if you want self-defense and fitness,  your best bets are Muay Thai (striking), Judo (grappling), BJJ (grappling), and Krav Maga (self-defense scenario training). Be warned that most Krav Maga schools are just scams where they leech you for money and don't actually give you any useful training.  No matter what style you choose to do,  make sure the school you join trains you in realistic scenarios with resistance. Muay Thai and Judo are great for that.

martialarts,3d4fwc,Fenor,3,Mon Jul 13 15:31:51 2015 UTC,"Yes being trained in martial arts will increase your likely hood of coming out of a situation like that not dead, however it's like saying knowing how to roll and fall is going to help you jump out of a car on the freeway.  You might have a better chance, but the outcome is still likely going to be bad.  Ive trained martial arts off and on for 15 years now, and the one thing I've noticed is any place that attempts to say they can help you in a knife fight is a joke of a place that is either in it for the money or is drinking their own kool aid.  As for physical fitness that is a good reason, but expect to need to actually work out outside of training.  Training is for learning techniques and practice, not cross fit.  You'll learn very quickly that while that big kind of fat guy may get winded on a track or treadmill he doesn't get winded in a fight as quickly as you would assume.  This is because breathing and exertion in a fight is different than cardio and you don't burn as many calories as you would think unless your training every day for an hour+.  If you want the most out of your time with an instructor take your physical fitness into your own hands.  Ask your instructor what are some good work outs while at home and do them.  When I was instructing I gave my students homework every class, it was usually something along the lines of run a couple miles(depending on who they were) and a number of push ups and pull ups as well as flexibility training.  Things that dont take much time and anyone can do, but pay off if you keep up with them.  100 push ups a day will really do a lot to help people get in shape."

martialarts,3d4fwc,Naa2078,2,Mon Jul 13 16:32:00 2015 UTC,"Even if you're an extremely good fighter,  things go very wrong when you're up against a weapon.  Very good fighters have lost their lives because they decided that they were good enough to disarm a gunman or take a knife away from a mugger.   Same thing goes for multiple attackers,  although if they're all unarmed it's definitely more doable.  However, you never know if your opponent is trained or not,  or if they've got a knife in their pocket.  Best thing to do in any fight situation is de-escalate and leave without throwing punches."

That doesn't mean it's not worth learning, but make damn sure that it's realistic if you're going to be doing any of it.  This sort of thing seems pretty good. Take note of how its mechanically simple and the objective is to stop a ""prison shiving"" type of attack from fucking you up too badly rather than a token disarm.  This is pretty bad. It makes the assumption that your opponent is going to come at you in a sort of sport fencing lunge from the front that magically freezes once the disarmer touches him."
martialarts,3d4fwc,PsychoticTwiddle,3,Tue Jul 14 00:20:13 2015 UTC,"Try out the schools near you first and see what you actually like. Searching specifically by style will sometimes lead you away from a school that would be perfect for you.   As for knife and gun, what others have said is spot on. If someone were to pull a knife expect to get cut. For a gun, remember that unless they are within arms reach, there is no technique. In either scenario giving them exactly what they ask for and hoping they take it and leave is your best option always. On top of that, situational awareness. You can sometimes avoid it altogether if you are aware of your surroundings and don't put yourself in places where you are vulnerable to such attacks, although this isn't always possible.   For self defense my first stops would be kenpo and Krav Maga. But as I said it's usually better to search for a good school rather than a good style.   Edit: if you're specifically looking for work with weaponry and such you may also want to look into Kali."

martialarts,3d4fwc,giantstonegoat,2,Mon Jul 13 13:54:42 2015 UTC,"You're going to get mixed answers, unfortunately. That's because people tend to espouse what they practice even if they're practicing less effective methods of fighting.  Since you're a new learner, you don't have biases that will work against you, so the first thing you need to see is the reality of a fight. This is very important to do because because martial arts are a combination of art and science, and you don't want to waste time and money learning more art than science when you're serious about self-defense. Watch this video. Notice how much more strenuous the active training is. That's the difference between fact and fiction in a fight. Now ask yourself how you're going to survive that.  To really learn how intense a fight can be without hurting yourself, start either boxing and wrestling. Realistically, it's safe to learn as much as you can reasonably stand to learn, but with boxing and wrestling you'll get a real sense of urgency that you'll need to respond to these situations much faster than you will from starting anywhere else; this is because your hands are the tools you're most likely to use, so it's easier to make sense of your training. Arts like muay thai and jiu-jitsu are both very useful too, but they have some counterintuitive features, so starting with those two would hold you back a little even though the knowledge is useful.  As far as disarming someone, you need to know that most drills practiced for knife and gun defense are insufficient if not totally useless. It's especially hard to take a knife away because there's almost no room for leverage. You can get leverage on a gun to take it away, but it is still a gun, so it's a big risk. When learning any kind of disarm, you must ask yourself ""can I do this quick?""  If you're looking for fitness while learning, any mixed martial arts gym is gonna be the best place to go.  Questions?"
martialarts,3d4fwc,Grarvindur,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:57:48 2015 UTC,"https://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/wiki/index   Hmmm, I would mix some street defense with something a bit more traditional like boxing or Muay Thai, and then some form of grappling.  Although a note on the knife/gun defense... it will be a long time before you could successfully pull that off, and even then there is a high risk chance of dying. A BJJ guy died recently trying to disarm a guy with a knife. SO yeah be careful."

An important thing is that we can't teach you how to feel safe, we can't fill a box with safety and give it to you, we can't sign a certificate saying you've achieved safety.  All we can do is teach you the highest percentage skills we know, and put you in situations to cultivate the confidence to do your best.  I recommend Krav Maga, because that's what I do, and a few weeks of getting stabbed with rubber knives will teach you the value of mastering the ancient technique of Noping Da Fuq out of there.  I have been doing KM for about a year and a half, and my experience has been that focusing on disarming the person will get you cut up real good.  Best results come from not being where they are trying to stab, or failing that trying to avoid getting cut while beating the piss out of the person.  If you have to take the knife out of their hands, the ideal time to do it is when they're laying on the ground.  All of the ""disarms"" and ""weapon defenses"" I know only work on someone who doesn't want to use the weapon on you.  Otherwise they would just shoot you from twenty feet away.  Sometimes they work, sometimes you get stabbed thirty times in ten seconds and the best you can do is take the attacker down with you."

martialarts,3d0u10,Carlos13th,6,Sun Jul 12 17:25:06 2015 UTC,Why are you training? What do you want to achieve from it? And what do you enjoy about TKD?  My usual comment would be do whichever class has the most sparring or pressure testing if you want to learn how to fight or defend yourself (which would usually be kickboxing). If you are training for different reasons however the answer would change.
martialarts,3d0u10,Carlos13th,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:47:10 2015 UTC,I'm training for agility and the ability to defend myself. I enjoy the discipline and knowledge and self-defence techniques gained from it.
martialarts,3d0u10,--u-s-e-r-n-a-m-e--,3,Sun Jul 12 21:29:29 2015 UTC,Then go for whichever school has the most sparring. But make sure its continuous sparring under a full contact ruleset (doesnt mean you have to spar as hard as you can) avoid low contact point sparring as while that will probably help with the agility side of things it will be far less useful for teaching you how to defend yourself.
martialarts,3d0u10,anonlymouse,3,Mon Jul 13 11:33:33 2015 UTC,"Kickboxing, definitely. A lot of TKD guys, myself included, have alright kicks but terrible punches. Kickboxing will help you develop much better punching and punch defense without losing out on using your (presumably excellent) kicks.  Shotokan will basically be more of the same, except you get the thrilling experience of working your way through a fairly rigid ranking system for the second time.   Kung-fu means nothing.  Wushu would be fantastic if you can find one with a heavy focus on sanda-style sparring, but dollars to donuts you can't.  Wing Chun is an entirely new way of thinking about striking compared to TKD, and it's not a particularly effective one."
martialarts,3d0u10,Grarvindur,2,Sun Jul 12 21:41:01 2015 UTC,"Shotokan Karate would be close to identical.  Kung-Fu doesn't mean anything, need to get more specific.  Wushu is pretty cool as dance and gymnastics, not as a fighting style unless they also do San Shou/Sanda.  Kickboxing would probably be the best move from ITF, as it's similar, but heavier contact.  Wing Chun is usually useless unless it's an IWCO school (and your English is too good for you to be near anywhere that has one)."

That said, boxing is a terrific martial art, and probably one of the least demanding ones in terms of flexibility. There's no kicking, no leg sweeps, no opening of the hips. As long as you can bend at the waist and rotate your torso you should be fine.  However, the no running thing is going to be a bit of an obstacle. Boxing requires excellent cardio, so if running is out of the question you might want to find a an appropiate substitute like cycling or swimming."

I began doing BJJ a while back and noticed that I could not only do it mostly pain free, but it help me in my daily life as well. Ex: Moving my body a different way to get out of bed instead of using a lot of leg movement. (Among a few other things)  However, there are a few things that cause me trouble. Some techniques from full guard (Scissor Sweep for example) as well as leg movements for an armbar from mount. Although these give me trouble sometimes, I have noticed it is less so the better I get at the techniques.  You can adjust your ""game"" to suit your needs. Guard can sometimes give me trouble so I work on my ""top game."" One of the instructors is a very talented brown belt with spine problems. What I've noticed is that having injuries can help force you to become more technical and use leverage over strength and flexibility.  Note that you need to be proactive in taking care of your joints. (Tap early and often) Also, Listen to your body and become friends with ibuprofen.)  Not sure what you're looking for in a martial art and also not getting into what is better than the other, but it does serve needs for self defense, fitness, and fun. As always, find a good gym and instructor.   Hope this helps and best of luck in your search."

martialarts,3cynao,anonlymouse,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:43:20 2015 UTC,"Just PT in order to have the muscles better support the hip. Surgery will eventually be needed, but I am trying to put it off for a long time since my job requires me to go hands on with people and sometimes I have a fight on my hands.   Landing on the hip doesn't hurt. I attribute this to proper break falling as I tend to be able to avoid landing on it. As I mentioned before, everyone is different, so listen to your body. Also, you could skip takedowns altogether. A lot of people prefer to start a roll on their knees, although I would recommend starting from the feet and doing takedowns if you can because that is incredibly important for defense as well as competitions. (If you choose to compete.)  A good gym with a good instructor will listen and accommodate your needs."

martialarts,3cx2vr,hatebeesatecheese,21,Sat Jul 11 15:18:21 2015 UTC,"On the lower end, it's because lots of people only know how to punch when they're wearing gloves to protect their hand.  Then when they try bareknuckle they're either pronating their hand and clipping their smaller metacarpals on the bag, or they're pawing at the bag and dragging their knuckles.  Both of which are often considered acceptable while wearing gloves.  I think there's a line between conditioning your hands and abusing them until they don't work anymore.

Work the bag with no gloves but stop before you really tear your knuckles up. It will take a while before your hands get used to full force hitting a hard bag.

In general, as long as you hit for speed and not for power, you should be fine.  Start with light jabs and work your way up to harder punches.  Throwing haymakers at the bag on day 1 will probably injure your wrists or hand.  Personally, I prefer to use MMA gloves or just use hand-wraps.  Another thing I tend to do when training for bare-knuckle is to use other parts of my hand and arm.  Hooks to the head, for example, can be landed on your forearms, either on the inside or by rotating your shoulder a little bit and striking with the top of your forearm.  Overhands and long hooks can be struck with the palm of your fist or like an open slap."

Excessively, it can damage your knuckles...same with anything that exposes your knuckles to heavy resistance (e.g knuckle push-ups on a solid surface).  I was warned against this by multiple people (5 minutes MAX on the bag was the general consensus) but in particular one who used to do large amounts of push ups on concrete and ended up losing a large amount of functionality in his hand, particularly the dexterity in his fingers."
martialarts,3cx2vr,0xdeadc0deh,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:09:56 2015 UTC,"Like any form of conditioning, if you're going to use bag work to condition your hands, the key is to work at an appropriate discomfort level, build the conditioning to comfort, increase intensity, repeat. If you never work harder than your body can handle you won't have an issue.  I've trained for about 15 years on bags in my martial art has always been bare knuckled. I've worked both canvas and vinyl bags and my hands have some very good conditioning. I knuckles never bleed anymore, I can punch really hard stuff without injury, and I don't have any issues with arthritis or joint pain.  That said there are certain levels of conditioning that you can do that will literally transform your body. I saw some video of an Okinawan karate master that had some really gnarly jacked-up hands. I've never been interested in going there, just in maintaining a decent level of condition so my hands are useful. If you want to build your power through bagwork (rather than focus on conditioning your hands/wrists) and your hands are not already conditioned enough to to do power work, then you should probably wrap your hands until your conditioning catches up to your strength.

A lot of boxers warm up with just wraps. And a fight with a proboxer against idiots on the street usually ends in a couple of 1-2s"
martialarts,3cx2vr,Treesarefriendsofall,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:09:52 2015 UTC,If you've only punched  with gloves on before you won't be able to make a proper fist. The way you hold your hands is very different.   There are a few case studies about boxers fractures after  fights due to bad fists. There's some notable cases too (eg Mike Tyson). The whole gloves make you hit harder thing is bs.
martialarts,3cx2vr,anon0108,2,Sun Jul 12 01:16:17 2015 UTC,"The usual line of reasoning about boxing for self-defense is if you are in a situation which calls for punching people in the face so hard they lose consciousness, the safety of your hands probably ranks low on your priority list.  Now if you just enjoy getting into fistfights, you are obviously going to need to change up your training protocols. It's hard to report to work with your hands looking like you put them through a meat grinder."
martialarts,3cx2vr,anon0108,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:43:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not necessarily disagreeing with your first point (though I'd certainly rather not get a hand injury), if your goal is to avoid injury and you aren't specifically training for a boxing tournament, training without gloves and learning to hit without them makes a lot of sense. My comment was more aimed at the  a couple of boxers I know would disagree"", given that nobody I never said boxing was bad for self defence, just that it could cause hand injury.  Also, as far as you hands looking like a meat grinder, what exactly are you thinking of? I've never had a serious problem, most kyokushin guys don't either. Even the more extreme hand conditioning guys (like Morio Higaonna and his rock) don't really have too much of an issue either. Besides, it's probably harder to turn up to work with broken hands."
martialarts,3cx2vr,BVKrustev,2,Mon Jul 13 11:19:06 2015 UTC,"training without gloves and learning to hit without them makes a lot of sense.   I grew up on the ""TMA"" side punching canvas sacks filled with sand so I understand this mentality. I just don't objectively know how much better off I am from proceeding in this manner rather than just learning how to box.   just that it could cause hand injury.   I think the reality is most strikers--especially the bigger guys--stand a good chance of injuring their hands if they use them in a fight unless they have competition experience working barhanded. Which is what makes kyokushin so special in my opinion.   Also, as far as you hands looking like a meat grinder, what exactly are you thinking of?   Hands swell up and get infected when you punch someone in the teeth. Nasty business.   I've never had a serious problem   Nor have I, but as I've aged, I've stopped punching stuff barehanded with the reckless abandon of my youth and am extremely cautious about it. I feel lucky my hands work as well as they do based on all the stupid stuff I did with them. But maybe I should infer from my own history that my training actually works and hand conditioning is legit. I guess I just have trouble recommending to strangers online that they should punch trees in their backyard like I did. Maybe it's just I think there are better uses of people's time than weaponizing their hands."

martialarts,3cy10r,aikidont,3,Sun Jul 12 01:07:08 2015 UTC,"Thank you for that,  it's nice to hear someone else understand that the techniques aren't reactionary.  If you haven't started moving by the time there is an attack, you're doing it wrong."
martialarts,3cy10r,DarthTheon,3,Sun Jul 12 01:47:39 2015 UTC,"I agree.  And Morihei Ueshiba certainly agreed as evidenced by the training manuals and what not that survive.  He clearly was of the opinion that there are situations where nage initiates contact.  You see the same methods in Daito Ryu, as well, which of course makes sense given that's what Ueshiba studied for the majority of his martial arts career.  It seems insane to me that any martial approach could be viewed as viable if you always have to wait for someone to begin attacking you before doing anything."
martialarts,3cy10r,aikidont,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:28:09 2015 UTC,"Not insane at all, arts like Balintawak prepare practitioners exceptionally well for reaction and are well suited for self defense. The art doesn't necessarily require that you have to wait for someone to attack but at beginning levels there is an assigned feeder (attacker) and reciever (defender) the goal of the training is to develop a strong abity to react and defend."

That's how I'd describe aikido for the most part, as well.  What I find insane is that someone would go through the system only doing this approach and expect it to replicate ""higher"" levels or more realistic forms of human combat.  If an art consists of entirely what you mentioned then I tend to see it as either not being in tune with reality or a system designed exclusively more for preservation of forms or a heritage/cultural/health system of martial art.  Please don't misunderstand, I'm not disparaging these approaches.  They have a very important place.  I'm disparaging a system that would utilize solely this approach and call itself a cohesive and complete self defense methodology.  I'm definitely not a ""kata hater"" like I see a lot in some places."
martialarts,3cy10r,aikidont,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:37:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah Ive seen that mentioned about aikido before. In a video with two guys fighting one of them an aikidoka, the commenters presumably aikidoka also make the excuse that an aikidoka must wait for an attack. This is ridiculous. I'm personally not a fan of aikido as a stand alone art, it's a nice add on, or if you train for reasons other than self defense or fighting I can see value there."
martialarts,3cy10r,Docholiday888,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:17:20 2015 UTC,"I'd really like for aikido to be a stand-alone art, but for martial efficacy in the modern world I tend to agree with you.  That said, I think at one time it was a cohesive system.  I draw a pretty big distinction between the aikido Morihei Ueshiba did/taught during his active teaching career and the guys did back in the day at the Ueshiba Juku (known as the ""Hell Dojo"") and most modern dojo.  I don't think most folks know that he'd pretty much retired by 1945 or so when he relocated to Iwama.  The aikido we see today isn't the result of his teachings but rather that of his son and a few select others.  On the plus side, like I'd mentioned in another comment, I'm starting to hear more and more about people looking forward in the sense that they want to bring aikido into a more applicable and modern reality and also looking back to study in depth just what Ueshiba was all about (not the vids from late in his life where he's ""throwing"" people without touching) and the skills he, his teacher and his peers went through.  I'm pretty excited about that and what the future may hold.  Granted I'm a self-professed cynic and critic of most aikido despite it being an art I really love and trained.  I think the current disconnect from reality is very much ""fixable"" if folks are willing to adapt to the changing times, genuinely study just what it was that made the techniques and concepts work and return it to being a more cohesive system.  That said, I can never say it's a bad idea for a martial artist to branch out and experience new styles and methods.  It's almost never a bad thing, imo.  Whether one keeps these new ideas or discards them, it's always important to keep an open mind and seek out what arts offer the goods one is looking for, be it martial competency or just simple ""moving meditation,"" so long as they're honest with their approach.  I came into aikido with a bjj background and while I love both of them, I find myself recommending stuff like judo or bjj to newcomers with the added advice that they can find great aikido once they understand some basic martial concepts that are simply missing from most dojo (though there are many that seek to have a more cohesive system, it's just the exception to the rule rather than the standard, unfortunately)."
martialarts,3cy10r,aikidont,0,Tue Jul 14 16:49:28 2015 UTC,"Aikido is functionally designed to count battlefield weapon attacks. Aikido doesn't have to be as passive as it but necessarily has one person who is ""the attacker""  and a ""defender"".  At least this is the case in classical aikido styles. Shoot Aikido is a new style that doesn't work that way and some people have individual aikido styles that aren't like that either. I certainly don't use it that way."
martialarts,3cy10r,tman37,6,Sun Jul 12 01:15:07 2015 UTC,"Of course this is all just my opinion .. I think the more passive approach (reactionary, or ""go-no-sen"") and the clear uke/nage (attacker/defender) division to practice is only useful in beginner/intermediate phases or maybe when encountering something new and wanting to break it down for study.  The blurring of uke/nage relationship, refinement of power generation (including all of the ""internal"" or solo training) and the like have always been part of the martial art, at least if you define it by what Ueshiba practiced and by what aikido's parent art consists of.  I think there's a lot of history and content that's not really well studied or seen by most people both inside and outside the aikido world.  The general view of aikido's potential is usually judged by the overly compliant and flashy (as in, taking big break falls and doing fancy looking demos) stuff we see on youtube, in most dojo and events like the All Japan Demo held each year at the Budokan.    Given all this, I certainly understand where opponents of aikido's effectiveness are coming from and tend to lean towards being pretty critical of most stuff I see.  I feel that way since the art nowadays consists largely of that stuff and most practitioners lack or avoid certain basic skills needed for any martial approach, whether it's a skill learnable in a few months or a few years.  That said, I have no idea what Shoot Aikido is!  What is that?  I hadn't heard of it until you mentioned it.  Always happy and eager to learn about new stuff going on in aikido because in the last decade or so it seems groups are emerging that break from the stagnant styles that've been dominant for the last ~50 years.  I'm excited to learn what innovative approaches people are pursuing, whether it's entirely new or attempts at reconstructing skills/methods many see as being removed from modern aikido."
martialarts,3cy10r,aikidont,4,Sun Jul 12 02:20:25 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you said with one major exception. The exception is the 99 percent of aikidoka don't practice that way. Everyone wants to emulate O-Sensei in the later years of his life.  They want to stand casually until attacked then make a couple of casual movements to throw uke.  It doesn't have to be like that but when you don't do it like that you are seen as not doing aikido.  I have used aikido in real fights, judo randori and bjj/mma sparring. I do not use my aikido passively,  which is also why I have absolutely no ranking in aikido, I don't fit in at an aikido dojo because I am to aggressive (in my technique,  I am actually a very nice guy lol).  BTW shoot aikido is a new thing which as far I know hasn't moved out of Japan yet. There are a few youtube videos. All the descriptions are in Japanese and my D in Japanese 101 doesn't allow me to read them.  Here is the link.   https://youtu.be/gFyi--AAFXw"
martialarts,3cy10r,tman37,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:31:30 2015 UTC,"Oh not ""aikido is designed for battlefield weapon attacks"".... Aikido is mainly a grappling style, in very loose terms, and grappling with no weapon against a weapon is a 99% suicide, not technique.   Of course, the weapon techniques of Aikido were battlefield and self-defence techniques... A long time ago. Today they are mostly forms devoid of function and resistant practice."
martialarts,3cy10r,BVKrustev,0,Mon Jul 13 04:58:12 2015 UTC,"Disagree completely.  Every successful weapons defense, involves controlling the arm of the attacker in some way.  Second, the proof is in the techniques. The three principles attacks fed to nage simulate an over hand sword strike, oblique sword strike and a Tanto lunge.  I'll have to dig out my books but in one of the books by Shirata sensei and John stevens, he makes a point of showing how each technique is related to katana work.  The distancing is wrong for unarmed work too. The distancing is perfect for kenjutsu. I feel like that is discussed in dynamic aikido but it has been years since I read it so don't quote me."
martialarts,3cy10r,tman37,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:25:32 2015 UTC,"There is no such thing as a successful unarmed weapon defence. There is such thing as a combination of luck and skill to survive. No technique will give you anything more than a small chance of survival against a sword.  But don't take it from me. Hear it from a student of Ueshiba, Kuroiwa Yoshio - http://www.aikiweb.com/forums/showthread.php?t=17729   I did go to one of the all-shihan meetings recently. Nidai Doshu asked if anyone had any more questions, and I said, ""We should stop doing tachi-dori and jo-dori in public demos. There are lots of real swordsmen in the audience, people who've really trained with swords, and they know that we can't really do such techniques. We are making fools of ourselves."" There was dead silence in the room. Finally Doshu changed the subject. Later, Saito-sensei came up to me. I thought he'd be angry, but he slapped me on the back and said, âYoku itte kureta.'(""Thanks for saying what needed to be said""). Well, maybe it needed to be said but nothing's changed, has it?   PS: Tachidori and jodori - unarmed techniques against sword and stick. To be clear, that's a 6th dan aikidoka, one of the early students, who refused higher ranks (they are not based on skill after 5th dan anyway), who says these techniques don't work. And he is saying it in front of Ueshiba's son (Doshu), and Morihiro Saito agrees with him."
martialarts,3cy10r,BVKrustev,0,Mon Jul 13 07:34:18 2015 UTC,"Don't put your limitations on me. No, weapons defenses aren't pretty like an aikido demonstration but when you can successfully and consistently defend yourself, in realistic and alive conditions,  I call that a successful weapons defense. I would suggest looking at Karl Tanswell's S.T.A.B. program for a successful, grappling based knife defense.  Other that, I agree with your quote. There are two keys points to take into account.  O-Sensei would have disagreed. He routinely taught and used aikido techniques as weapons defenses. Second,  Saito was a student of Ueshiba's later period where aikido was much softer and less martial. Shirata was a pre war uchi deshi of Ueshiba's and he claimed aikido was inescapably joined to the sword."
martialarts,3cy10r,tman37,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:25:56 2015 UTC,"I am not saying Aikido is not connected to the sword. I am just arguing against unarmed weapon defences. They are unrealistic and don't work. Funny thing is, there is an easy way to test a weapon defence. Show me a video of one working against a realistic attack and I won't put my limitations on you.   And yeah, Ueshiba did make such demos. But because I respect the guy I assume he had a pedagogical idea of some sort that is not connected with actual usage of those techniques against people. My other option is to deem him an idiot."

It shows only after the grab, and it shows a defence only against an idiotic and slow straight stab to the stomach (although that is a common attack). Also, even if they grab the had, the attacker does nothing sensible after that but resist like a mule with no thought or aggressiveness whatsoever. Nothing from what you see in real knife attacks."
martialarts,3cy10r,BVKrustev,0,Tue Jul 14 00:35:36 2015 UTC,"I forgot to mention that while you may think weapons defenses are stupid and don't work, Ueshiba simply disagreed.

Luckily, aikido federations are big, and the Bulgarian one managed to bring a lot of Japanese teachers here, two or three guys every year. They told us a lot, and taught us a lot, and we're in general great people. I remember especially the late Shihan Fumio Toyoda, a man with great sense of humor and impressive culture of movement and knowledge of biomechanics.  Katori Shinto Ryu is small here, but we did manage to bring three instructors as well - Tetsutaka Sugawara and his students, Petteri Silenius and Saito Shinichi.   Saito-san even learned a bit of Bulgarian and stayed here for three months, and his English was good for a Japanese guy, I had some great talks with him. It also helped he was actually quite young (I think 29 at the time) and very open to discussion. He also visited the HEMA school I am now an assistant at and was very impressed with what we do and how similar it is to kenjutsu. After our training, he was happy to sit down in a crappie Chinese restaurant over a beer and tell us details about Japanese warfare, especially in earlier periods, that are extremely hard to find in translated works.   I really respect people like them, willing to travel thousands of miles, often for just a small fee and the travel costs covered, and show others the knowledge they have with openness that many European teacher of Asian martial arts lack.  That was one of the reasons I quit Katori here - the local instructor refused to answer some questions because of ""secrecy"" (simple ones, really, some I figured out on my own later) that Sugawara and Saito answered like it they were just small details (which they were). It is funny and pathetic when western teachers try to be more Japanese than the Japanese."

The loy pak da (the split entry with strike) is a wing chun technique, but pure wing chun would use a closer range vertical fist.

martialarts,3cwmcu,kromberg,3,Sat Jul 11 12:08:52 2015 UTC,"family dynamics: it is essential in a self-defense situation that your family (children, SO, etc) do not actively interfere with your ability to defend yourself or them.  It is a common response to want to âhold backâ a loved one to prevent a violent encounter (especially a SO). This will tie up your hands and make it impossible to defend yourself (and them) if attacked. Therefore, you need to make sure your family trusts you to respond appropriately in a confrontation, and knows in no uncertain terms that they need to GET OUT OF THE FRIGGIN LINE OF FIRE AND OUT OF YOUR WAY. This is especially important if an actual weapon might come into play.  Another common response (especially for children) is to latch on to you if they become frightened. While understandable, this is just as dangerous as the previous situation. If you are most frequently out in a two-parent scenario, train your kids to go to one parent (who evacuates to a safe location / takes up a defensive position) while the other controls the confrontation. If in a one parent scenario, teaching kids to run a safe distance away if a confrontation arises is probably the safest bet. It will help to have a family plan in place beforehand, and possibly a code word for âsomethings gonna go down/ its time to evacuateâ to make sure everyone is on the same page."

I can't remember tbh if I did trip his leg but the guy was much bigger than me and fell backwards to the ground doing almost a full roll before landing on his back so I figure either I must have tripped him, or he was drunker than he looked."
martialarts,3cwmcu,Gback,2,Sat Jul 11 14:31:16 2015 UTC,"I have learned to grab principals by the back of the waist, and keep at arm's length.  Hard to do with women sometimes, but it will generally work.  Keeping the principal at arm's length means they are less likely to interfere, such as them clinging on to your arm and unintentionally immobilizing said arm.  Holding on to them also means you can take your eyes off of them but you will still know where they are.  Finally, doing this will allow you to guide them towards whatever direction you need them to go, without tying up their arms as well."

martialarts,3cwmcu,Gback,2,Sat Jul 11 23:18:30 2015 UTC,"This is a great topic.  I think we should all focus more on group self-defense.  Not that there's anything wrong with training to fight against single opponents, but in real life, there usually lots of people around us, and you never know when someone else might jump in to fight you (or maybe even help you).   To me, there are three basic sub-categories under the group umbrella.  First is fighting against multiple assailants.  Second is fighting while protecting someone.  Third is fighting WITH someone.  When detailed, each can expand into large topics unto itself.  However, as far as quick and dirty training goes, it need not be overly complicated to start out.  Take your basic one-on-one sparring, and simply add a third person.  Have them be an additional opponent, have them be someone you need to protect, or have them be a person you need to learn to coordinate with.  As we pursue these sub-categories further, you start to get into fascinating fields ranging from executive protection to active shooter styled training.  There's a lot out there.  A lot of important skills those who are serious about self-defense should pursue... and not enough instructors and schools pushing the training for them."

martialarts,3cxaxo,ichneumon,4,Sat Jul 11 18:34:38 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that you can technically increase bone density through certain forms of conditioning work. For example, Thai style shin conditioning should increase bone density. However I have never seen a good answer as to the functionality/practical effects of those gains."
martialarts,3cxaxo,mattBernius,2,Sun Jul 12 00:03:21 2015 UTC,"In my experience it largely depends on how the person trained, which determines if they have scars or not.  That's the only difference I have noticed.  Generally it is things like stance, fluidity of movement, and confidence that make me think ""This person can take a hit."" rather than any sort of difference in skin."
martialarts,3cxaxo,MacintoshEddie,2,Mon Jul 13 02:32:15 2015 UTC,"Where I used to train, people I would train with (including my instructor) participated in bone-strengthening training. It had a specific name but I forget what it was called. Anyways, it involved walking across the room with a partner and hitting your forearms together fairly hard. Then the calcium buildup would be massaged back into the bone. Very effective training and I specifically remember my Guru dragging his arm down the edge of a table and hearing individual bumps and grooves in his forearm, crazy stuff. Before this though, we would do tissue-conditioning throughout all of our training. This makes your skin tougher and yes you build up more of a resistance to pain. However I don't think you would see a drastic difference in your skin for many years. Hope this was somewhat helpful."

I'd go so far as to say that, at least the rough idea of an open rule set which allows for any/a wide number of styles is the best thing to happen to martial arts in the modern day. Honestly I feel like how we treat pro-athletes is the problem. There's simply too much celebrity worship. Now that's not to justify anyone's behavior in a ""oh, it's just gone to their head."" kind of way, it's their responsibility to make sure they're not acting like peices of shit, but I think it's the veiwer's responability to impartially recognize who's acting like a peice of shit and isn't the greatest role model.

And yes, as you allude to, this is the result of how we treat and worship pro athletes, and I would say how that ultimately affects the evolution of sports.  There are a lot of people who train MMA because they want to do what those celebrity athletes can do.  It's similar to the explosion of Karate dojos after Daniel LaRusso won the All-Valley Karate Championships over Johnny from Cobra-Kai.   I think it's the veiwer's responability to impartially recognize who's acting like a peice of shit and isn't the greatest role model. You can still learn from them, just don't try to be them   Children aren't able to properly contextualize things like that, and it's an incredibly difficult thing for parents to navigate and manage.  Unless you experience everything they see, or hear what they talk about with their friends, you can't really put that stuff in context for them.

Even with very morally upright competitors across the board, we'd still talking about an inherently very violent sport. To a certain degree I almost feel like martial arts should be one of those things you don't expose your kids to until they're mature enough to contextualize it, but like you said, that's much easier said than done. As for holding the competitors to moral standard, ideally that'd be alright, but I think the first step would be for the UFC to stop having the corporate sanctioned segments for shit talking before their fights. This sort of thing is seriously probably one of the biggest things that would draw shitty people into the sport and probably sets the worst example."

At least they did come out with a code of conduct in the UFC:   Fighters shall conduct themselves in accordance with commonly accepted standards of decency, social convention, and morals, and fighters will not commit any act or become involved in any situation or occurrence or make any statement which will reflect negatively upon or bring disrepute, contempt, scandal, ridicule or disdain to the fighter or the UFC.

Every father would like to see his son learning to defend himself but with respect, with peace in your heart. That being said, I have no interest at all in martial arts being mixed, this thing without any doctrine or concept. Today, MMA has simply turned into a circus, extreme, violent, and sensationalist, which only attracts people who like barbarianism and all that blood.

You've only done martial arts for two years. That's a pretty short span of time in martial art years. And Taekwondo is such a small part of the martial arts world. Taekwondo competition is even smaller than that. It's a small bubble you're in now and you can stay in it if you want to, but there's a lot more out there to experience as a martial artist. And with the prospect of moving to college soon, those doors are going to be wide open.  I'm not telling you to switch out of Taekwondo completely if you hit your ceiling, but you may be more excited about your future as a martial artist if you keep your perspective broad. Have you considering stepping into boxing and learning their hand techniques? What about something with weapons? Swords, staff, or sticks? Do you know anything about throwing?

We met through TKD, and I was there when he earned his black belt. Just in the last year or so, he decided he wanted to compete.  With almost no support from the old TKD school, he began training for it. He started up a TKD club at his university. Ended up winning states and flew to Austin to compete in nationals.  He lost, but he's going to try again next year.  You're definitely not too old, or in too awkward a place, to aspire to that, and unlike him you've been training somewhere that DOES develop champions. I used to spar with this dude regularly and it was generally fairly one-sided in my favor; I'm not champion material, and one look at me sparring or a glance at my tournament record will show you that.  If he could take himself to that level practically on his own, you can manage it, too.  And don't forget, we had a guy in his late 20s-mid 30s medalling in the Olympics for a few years.

martialarts,3cvqmx,sreiches,7,Sat Jul 11 12:05:56 2015 UTC,"I think TKD is one of those activities that requires such a flexible body that only the young can be good at it.  It's not a MA that you are going to be able to do anywhere near the same when you're 40 and certainly you won't be doing it better.  There are other activities like this, gymnastics is a good example, it's mainly for the young, older athletes don't do well, that doesn't mean they can't do gymnastics, just that they won't be able to compete for long.  So I would say pursue TKD while you still can, and then when your body starts to get less flexible or slower you can just transition to a different MA like Judo or something.  There are lots of old dudes in Judo."
martialarts,3cvqmx,phauna,2,Sat Jul 11 12:24:22 2015 UTC,I don't know why you were down voted. Not to mention Judo or any sort of grappling would be be extremely beneficial to your self defense if you can already kick effectively.

I don't really work with wood (other than occasionally chopping firewood), but from what I understand it depends a lot on the humidity and temperature of where you are at, and a lot of professionals either dry their wood in a humidity controlled room or buy wood that's been kiln dried.  I found this guide, which seems to suggest that 1-2 weeks is a good average after cutting the piece into the rough shape of what you want."

Pros use specific tools to accurately measure moisture content. You can ""force"" the drying in a few weeks by putting the stave in a PVC tube with a small light bulb in one end and stored vertically..... I have not tried this but they say it works well......

martialarts,3cty32,Enthused_Llama,3,Fri Jul 10 21:48:02 2015 UTC,"I mean, ignoring the knife defenses, a good number of those techniques could probably be put into practice. A lot of those first set of techniques would really be in a situation where you got the drop on them, though.   Say, for instance, that you were some sort of Police Officer and the situation turned hostile/was about to turn hostile and you wanted to neutralize the suspect as quickly as possible. I've seen that one where he pulls the dude's legs out as a sentry takedown for military application.  None of that 'off of a punch' stuff. More like thinks are getting shove-y and you want to take the dude down. Once you're in a full-blown fight it's time for judo/sanda if you're this guy."

martialarts,3cvti2,darthturtle3,6,Sun Jul 12 10:52:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly the best advice is just find money for proper training. We can discuss proper footwork and striking technique, but without a knowledgable instructor there to correct your mistakes you'll just develop bad habits. It's always easy to spot the people who just research techniques online and practice with friends when they come to the gym. I love the initiative and enthusiasm they show by looking into boxing or any other martial art, but they always have bad habits - like dropping their off hand when punching, not turning their leg when kicking, fighting from unbalanced stances, or not breathing properly. The last one is my favorite. Everyone looks so closely at techniques, but then forgets to breathe.   Unless you're with someone with experience, I would advise extremely basic things. Getting comfortable moving on your feet in a good stance, getting accustomed to throwing hooks and straights, and breathing well while you do it. Even then, it's easy to develop bad habits, but it's something."
martialarts,3cqh8u,Carlos13th,16,Thu Jul 9 23:24:18 2015 UTC,Probably the most practical looking Aikido I've seen. Good find. Thanks for posting quality stuff. I'd probably pass on another user.
martialarts,3cqh8u,M3atboy,12,Thu Jul 9 23:47:50 2015 UTC,"I always thought Shodokan aikido's sparring would be cooler if they allowed the use of atemi.  All the Tomiki sparring I've seen, though, stays within that very strict ruleset favoring very ""clean"" throws.  A lot like modern kendo, I suppose.  There seems to be a strong urge to keep the sport ""clean"" instead of favoring the type of sparring we see in judo, bjj or boxing.  Maybe I'd just really like to see some aikido people knock the stew out of each other..."
martialarts,3cqh8u,aikidont,7,Thu Jul 9 23:50:52 2015 UTC,Id watch that.
martialarts,3cqh8u,JadedMagic,4,Fri Jul 10 00:26:26 2015 UTC,I think adding atemi could make this a very interesting sport. Seems like most of aikidos throws rely on the opponent striking first.
martialarts,3cqh8u,LastWWolf,5,Thu Jul 9 23:54:19 2015 UTC,"Id probably take up aikido again, if they allowed atemi and started sparring universally. Until then, I cant take it seriously."
martialarts,3cqh8u,deadwisdom,0,Fri Jul 10 00:30:43 2015 UTC,"How do competitions handle joint locks and the like?  In the small amount of Aikido I learned, that was the focus.  If you were doing it all the way, you would break your opponent's arm."
martialarts,3cqh8u,aikidont,3,Fri Jul 10 06:12:33 2015 UTC,"I'm really not sure.  I don't know the rules they go by.  I've seen a lot of Tomiki/Shodokan competitions, though, and joint locks really don't come up much.  I'm not sure if certain ones are banned or if it's for the same reasons we don't really see them come up in sports where they're allowed.  Most of the throwing seems to favor those clean unbalances like in the video, with techniques like irimi nage and the various kokyu-type throws (dunno their names)."
martialarts,3cqh8u,sreiches,8,Fri Jul 10 15:45:10 2015 UTC,"Interestingly, it ends up looking like short, clashing versions of Judo grip fighting.  Also, I feel like Tomiki Aikido with Atemi might end up looking a bit like Sanda/Sanshou in practice, since both seem to focus on achieving the takedown on contact rather than through persistence."
martialarts,3cqh8u,farkoman,2,Fri Jul 10 02:53:12 2015 UTC,"Interestingly, it ends up looking like short, clashing versions of Judo grip fighting.   Except they are focused on sleeve/wrist and don't bother with finishing the clinch with a collar/overhook, which in judo usually defines who is going to throw whom."
martialarts,3cqh8u,sreiches,3,Fri Jul 10 17:26:29 2015 UTC,"Which is a little strange. I'd have figured Kokyu-nage and Irimi-nage would have been their go-to moves, both of which use some degree of head/neck control."
martialarts,3cqh8u,JadedMagic,8,Fri Jul 10 17:49:08 2015 UTC,"Would like to see more of this, while most of it wasn't impressive I think seeing some sort of competitive aikido would be interesting. (Yes I understand O'sensei wouldn't approve of it, and yes I understand aikido is a spiritual journey, but I think aikido needs some more aliveness in its art. Just my own opinion.)"
martialarts,3cqh8u,mattBernius,12,Thu Jul 9 23:51:28 2015 UTC,"Yes I understand O'sensei wouldn't approve of it   To be fair, the question isn't so much would O'Sensei approve of it, as it is, would O'Sensei have approved of it at X time in his life.  It's pretty clear that he changed his views on what constituted ""Aikido"" a number of times on his journey. I suspect that at an earlier phase he might have really appreciated this. And at a later point in his life he might have rejected it."
martialarts,3cqh8u,JadedMagic,5,Fri Jul 10 01:13:43 2015 UTC,"You are correct sir. I guess if we were following a linear progression of what he desired in aikido this would be frowned upon. To be honest though who can really say what he would want out of aikido in todays world? With the prevalence of BJJ perhaps he would want the art to be more alive to appeal to a larger part of the world and spread its teachings in that way. I apply a lot of aikidos philosophy in my own BJJ practice, the competition aspect honestly allows you to confront your own ego in ways being compliant does not."
martialarts,3cqh8u,mattBernius,5,Fri Jul 10 01:22:48 2015 UTC,"FWIW, a younger O'Sensei is said to have remarked that Aikido is 70 percent atemi (striking) and 30 percent nage (throwing).  Depending on which of his original students you read, that percentage sometimes goes up as high as 90.  Personally there's a lot about Aikido and the other Aiki arts that I love. Can't do them worth shit, but I still appreciate the concept and the overall goal."
martialarts,3cqh8u,aikidont,2,Fri Jul 10 01:32:42 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure Ueshiba's take on atemi never changed much.  You see him using it even in videos very late in his life.
martialarts,3cqh8u,mattBernius,5,Fri Jul 10 15:49:00 2015 UTC,"Man, then someone really screwed up the transmission of that ""atemi"" focus after his death. Because it seems like a number of the schools that descend from the later students didn't get that particular memo."
martialarts,3cqh8u,aikidont,4,Fri Jul 10 18:32:35 2015 UTC,"Tell me about it, man.  Somewhere along the way that focus on actually knowing how to strike got jacked, and that could be a rant of its own if we look at the history and what Ueshiba did after WWII (basically becoming more of a figurehead than anything for the aikido HQ dojo) ..    Modern aikido's got a ton of messed up stuff going on in my opinion, and de-emphasizing learning proper ways to punch and kick is a big one.  I'm sure we could go on forever about what's messed up with aikido, though..  and I say that as someone who actually still likes it (in some forms), is well read on its history and did it for a decent amount of time."
martialarts,3cqh8u,sreiches,5,Fri Jul 10 19:27:24 2015 UTC,"I think one of my favorite Aikido moments came in college. I was a black belt in Taekwondo and also had experience in Shotokan karate. I'd say that a basic ""tsuki"" was well within my means.  In one of my first classes, we'd partnered up for a drill involving a throw off a punch. I punched and, when my partner tried the technique, it didn't work.  ""You're punching wrong.""  I don't know how I didn't laugh my way out of the room."

BJJ is very much water, you have to flow with your opponent and fit your whole body to the shape of an ever changing situation.  I see Sumo or wrestling as earth because of how much strength and directness you need with it, and a striking art like Muay Thai or boxing as fire due to the explosive nature.  Aikido, however, is absolutely air to me.  These guys are masters at breezing past their opponents and using their energies quickly against them.  Maybe I watched too much Avatar."

martialarts,3cqh8u,MarshallUberSwagga,2,Fri Jul 10 10:18:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  I feel like becoming proficient in one style from each ""element""would create an incredibly well rounded fighter."
martialarts,3cqh8u,forgotclac,3,Fri Jul 10 13:55:22 2015 UTC,"Some strikers, I would say, turn their arts into water or earth. There are boxers who just flow between blows before their counters come crashing in. Meanwhile, Kyokushin and Muay Thai practitioners often stand and trade, defending by taking hard shots with tension rather than evasion (last night's session may have involved dropping medicine balls on each other's stomachs). You're expected to be a human wall.  It's kind of like the new Street Fighter, in which characters will have elements. Ryu's is lightning and, despite coming from the same style, Ken's is fire.

If you have to use it for real how effective is it? I'm sure it's effective, but how do you go from the choreographed part to the real part?"
martialarts,3cqh8u,Apollo78,7,Fri Jul 10 01:48:53 2015 UTC,"It's unfortunately a bit of a problem for a lot of places that, no offense to aikido as a whole because...well, look at the high quality above, they don't necessarily do much that isn't choreographed. I get the sense that you might be new to martial arts or at least the traditional martial arts (common abbreviation, TMA.). Basically TMAs have a bit of a chronic quality control issue, outside of their home countries at least, I never heard of shit Karate coming from Japan, not to say it doesn't exist, but it seems less common than in the US. Its NOT fair to call all of them shit or an entire art shit, but to be brutality honest some are known for having lower quality control than others and Aikido is one of those. A symptom of this dip in quality in any given Dojo/Dojang/Gym of any given style is a lack of sparring or non-compliant work and given Aikido's ideals of pacifism and minimal use of force, some people take it to mean sparring fundamentally goes against everything Aikido stands for because it means someone is being aggressive at any given moment during. My advice is not to not go into Aikido as it's clearly got a lot in its arsenal that other grappling styles will not give you, so long as it's good that is, it's just to be careful and to make abundantly sure that whatever place you go to spars. They may call it ""randori"", as that's the Japanese word for it. Good luck dude, even if you can't find good Aikido, I'd recommend Judo.

martialarts,3cqh8u,sevenstaves,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:02:56 2015 UTC,"Same here, I'm in a small town and I'd say Aikido is more common. I'm just suggesting Judo because it's the most common art that I'd consider very close to Aikido.  Edit: to be clear, Judo if he doesn't find good Aikido."
martialarts,3cqh8u,flowgod,3,Fri Jul 10 18:00:43 2015 UTC,"Part of the reason it always looks (and is) so choreographed is that it could be quite brutal if used recklessly. Small joint manipulation is pretty dangerous, and a lot of those wrist locks you see are incredibly painful and could cause some serious damage if you're not extremely careful. I was practicing with a white belt one time who Nikkyo'd me a little too hard, and my wrist was messed up for weeks.   Aikido has turned into an ""art for art's sake"" martial art, focusing more on the spiritual journey and traditions. I had an awesome instructor who taught us atemi and focused on drilling us in very realistic situations. When I moved, I quit all together because the way other schools taught just didn't appeal to me.   Modern aikido is a great example of what happens when arts refuse to adapt, and would rather cling to tradition just for the sake of practicing tradition. I really wish someone would come along to do what the Gracie's did for JJJ / Judo and say ""here's what it does great, here's what could be done better, and here's how we can teach it better."""
martialarts,3cqh8u,sorry_tried_my_best,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:19:10 2015 UTC,"Serious question: In Aikido you're usually trained to be poised but static; then to use timing, speed and the attackers momentum against themselves. In this example, I see both ukemi as well as nagi hopping around like bunny rabbits; wouldn't this somewhat nullify one's shisei?"

martialarts,3cryk3,blindside1,2,Fri Jul 10 08:00:54 2015 UTC,"What's worth noting is how important it is to get close body control of the knife.   From about :13 to :20 Irish appeared to have the arm relatively secured and the knife trapped against his body in a position where there was little functional leverage.  Then at about :20  to :25 distance gets created and suddenly he's trying to control via the hand. And from then the knife is continuing to trace back and forth in front of his soft bits as he struggles for control. That's the point where the knife becomes arguably the most dangerous, because in order to maintain control, Irish needs to bring it to his center mass where he's the strongest.  And yeah, Irish ends up getting side mount, but I'm curious as to whether or not Irish hit that trapped blade when he was pulled to the floor. Sure looks like he might have initially fallen on the attackers knife before trapping that arm on the ground."
martialarts,3cryk3,mattBernius,2,Fri Jul 10 18:10:07 2015 UTC,"If you go back and look at a lot of the dagger material in historical european martial arts, for instance like Fiore, you see a good amount of focus on establishing control of the weapon hand and working from there."

martialarts,3cryk3,ichneumon,2,Fri Jul 10 16:14:11 2015 UTC,"To me what makes that kick interesting is that because of the mismatched leads the leg seems less likely to get a serious cut compared to a matched lead situation where thrusts to the inside of the leg are a high probability.  Particularly if he used it as a leg kick instead of a body kick. edit (actually he did use it as a leg kick, just a high one.)"

The cut he got for his trouble wouldn't be nearly as bad as the one he'd get for throwing the right.  I think the risk/return on leading with a kick in this case doesn't make sense.

martialarts,3crnt2,Nicrl,5,Fri Jul 10 05:45:35 2015 UTC,"Way too much focus on ""lead foot dominance"". The video ignores that you can take angles to either the inside or outside of the foot. And it doesn't depend on speed or reach like the video suggests, it depends on positioning. If you step to the inside but let your back turn to the opponent, like Nelson did against Story, you're walking into his back hand. If you face your opponent as you circle that way though, and do it at the right distance, you square him up and get a clear path for your rear hand while making his more dangerous to throw. Plus if you go around trying to step outside carelessly, you only telegraph your intentions and square yourself up. Look what happened to Buchinger when he tried to establish lead foot dominance on McGregor, for example:  https://gfycat.com/IdenticalEminentJapanesebeetle  He had his foot outside, but he was squared up. McGregor didn't have his back turned, he keep his feet lined up, slipped and even pivoted to take a bigger inside angle as he threw the punch--something he does all the time whether his opponent are attacking or retreating. If any of you noticed, the beginning of the video says that when one guy ""wins the lead foot battle"", the other guys' rear hand is too far away. But then he went and showed Rory using his rear hand to counter Lawler stepping outside without explaining the contradiction.   In addition, Lawler vs MacDonald doesn't come down to who's foot is inside or out. It comes down to distance and pace. Lawler's angles don't mean much if he can't get into the pocket, but at the same time Lawler did a lot of circling inside Rory's lead foot to take away Rory's jab.   In Nelson vs Story, Nelson's complete inability to use his hips on the feet and backing straight up was a way bigger problem than letting Story step outside.   It's not a bad video, and there were some good parts. He explained cage cutting well, and his brief mention of the weak plane being exposed was good--especially when you consider that Mendes has exceptional timing and loves his blast double, and when you consider that Rory has only gotten better at catching kicks--but overall I found a lot of points oversimplified."

Fun to see the chess match with all the pieces broken down.

martialarts,3crnt2,Gumbi1012,5,Fri Jul 10 15:53:58 2015 UTC,"It only does that if you don't pivot properly, and the opponent does. Just haphazardly stepping your foot outside will square you up, leaving you open to both takedowns and punches. Notice that most of the examples of Rory trying to take Lawler down were off caught kicks, meaning the back leg hadn't moved around. If you take an outside angle correctly, the opponent is gonna have a lot of turning to do before they can actually threaten you, and you just have to turn a little."

martialarts,3crnt2,farkoman,2,Fri Jul 10 13:47:40 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't obsess too much about it.

Erislandy Lara, Mayweather, RJJ, Rigondeaux as well. In MMA, Machida, Michael Johnson, Vitor Belfort, the Diaz bros, dos Anjos, Lawler, all will circle inside for various reasons."
martialarts,3crnt2,mma_boxing_wrestling,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:36:52 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with taking ""T position"". I was always taught to take outside foot position against a southpaw (or whenever possible) but not to get too far out there with it. Just a subtle shift of positioning can make a big difference in angles and in the case of MMA is less exposed to a take down than being almost squared up at a T.  Besides that it's not just as simple as walking into position, the position has to be taken in a subtle fashion or a smart guy will figure out what you're about. Besides that it's not some panacea that makes it like cheat mode, someone who knows what they are doing can play the inside angles as well, it's just a different game with different possibilities."

The distinction that made me leave karate was that knowledge of is basically useless compared to knowledge how. It's the difference between an ESPN analyst or announcer and the player they're covering. Theoretical knowledge versus knowledge in the bones. As DT Suzuki put it in Zen and the Art of Archery by Eugen Herrigel:   If one really wishes to be master of an art, technical knowledge of it is not enough.

I can react and grab a stick much better. Many of the disarms I know work better with a rounded profile than a flat one--the list goes on.

The more you spar and try and what you have learned the more it will work for you.   Your game plan is sound, wearing the gear will get you accustomed to it. Although you need to be careful that you feel comfortable with a stick in and out of gear.    Everyone gets that fear when the first spar, if you do it properly it is suppose to give you a poke in the eye to get you thinking. So dont worry about it bud :). Just relax, spar and you will see the knowledge you have gained will quickly come to you once you have pressure tested yourself."

I'll block and just stop and instead of flowing strikes, counters, and checks together.  There's some other stuff at play. Kind of dumb considering how poorly I'm doing--I'm not actually a threat to my opponents, but I'm afraid of hurting my partners. I know how to do a lot of stuff they're either not used to or just don't do themselves and there's a wall in my mind of what I can do and what I should do.

You answered your own question.   I think the protective gloves and helmet are subtle distractions that remove the familiar sensation of holding a stick--so it feels as though my hand is in use, but it's in use by something alien. It's a burden rather than a boon.   FWIW, when I was doing full contact, I typically cut out a good chunk of the palm of my glove so I would still be able to ""feel"" the majority of the stick. It still wasn't the same, but it helped. I also looked for the lightest pair of gloves that I could find that still offered some protection.  It's been years but I think I ended up settling on street hockey gloves versus lacrosse. I need to dig out that box and take a look."

martialarts,3cqs20,Little_Johnny20,6,Fri Jul 10 00:53:43 2015 UTC,"Above all else this is a case where an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Most guys who get cornered back straight up then try to circle out. It's too late at that point. The secret to staying off the cage/ropes is pivoting. Not standing up tall and circling out, holding your ground and using tight pivots--a skill many fighters are lacking.   Even fighters with good footwork can be cornered by a good pressure fighter though, so escaping is still valuable to practice. First you have to understand why being cornered is bad. In short, it compromises your ability to control distance, and thus your ability to control timing. It limits your movement. Finally, if you let it, it compromises your positioning. That's why the most important thing to keep in mind is maintaining your stance. Don't straighten your legs, don't square your feet and don't lean back on the cage. Keep yourself grounded, keep your lead leg in front and rear leg in back. As soon as you feel yourself nearing the cage/ropes, don't take a single step farther back. You always want to have a little bit of room behind you, and if your rear heel ever touches the boundary then you absolutely need to plant your feet and hold your ground.  With your stance in tact, you keep as much control as possible. From there, misdirection is key. If you just step forward, you get countered. If you just step to a side, you walk into a hook or kick. If you just shoot, you get stuffed, or duck into a knee/uppercut. You have to do something that forces the opponent to give you space to move. You have to feint. You can feint a step, a punch, a kick, anything. You can even jab or teep to try to force the opponent to step in and throw. The important part is to make him commit before you do, then escape wherever you can. The way out is the same way you avoid getting cornered in the first place--pivots. It doesn't really matter if you shoot, clinch, punch, bait or only move your feet, pivots are essential. Drill pivots over and over and over. Pivots are probably the most neglected and most poorly performed footwork skill, especially in MMA."
martialarts,3cqs20,mma_boxing_wrestling,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:58:57 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot for this contribution. Any idea why pivots are so poor in MMA?
martialarts,3cqs20,mma_boxing_wrestling,3,Fri Jul 10 04:07:04 2015 UTC,"Of course, because they aren't being taught well. Pivots, like most techniques, are really simple to perform--but they're also really easy to screw up. Common mistakes when pivoting are standing straight up, moving the wrong foot first, moving back then trying to shuffle around, moving both feet at the same time, turning on the spot in situations that you need to step around, etc.   In addition to doing them wrong, or simply never being taught how to do them at all, guys get used to sparring on open mats. When you have a ton of room to move behind you, you have more freedom to fight in a linear fashion without being punished for it. That means guys don't necessarily even feel the need to develop their angles on defense, or on offense for that matter, because they can just use distance. Of course, that becomes a problem as soon as there's a boundary, and becomes a problem against someone who does know how to pivot. But it's harder to learn to cut tight angles than it is to move in big arcs, and it's especially hard when you aren't comfortable with another guy being somewhat close to you, so the pivots get neglected. Then someone like Aldo who pivots well schools guys who try to come straight at him."
martialarts,3cqs20,Toptomcat,3,Fri Jul 10 16:48:55 2015 UTC,"Also, pivots are punishable with leg kicks, so they don't tend to be used much in classic Muay Thai. If your primary striking base is MT- which is the case for a lot of MMA fighters- you'll tend to favor clinching over hit-and-away footwork for distance management."
martialarts,3cqs20,mma_boxing_wrestling,3,Fri Jul 10 20:37:22 2015 UTC,"That's a fair point, two good recent examples are Cerrone vs Alvarez and Makdessi. He chopped both of their legs down when they tried to pivot. That said, it's very easy to lower your level as you pivot, catch a leg kick and bomb the other guy with a right straight or left hook or knee tap him."
martialarts,3cqs20,SteelDiscipline,0,Fri Jul 10 21:02:23 2015 UTC,Because MMA has poor striking in general. MMA is still pretty archaic  in its thought process for training and care more about being tough and hitting hard instead of focusing on technique. Notice that most MMA fighters have horrible defense.
martialarts,3cqs20,sylkworm,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:51:32 2015 UTC,"This video shows a boxing pivot step, they call it side-step, which is a really great way to get out from a corner.  Despite the video title, it's not a beginner move and takes a lot of practice.  Of course, the best way to get out of a corner is to not get backed into one in the first place.  Circling is a good strategy as well as a good teep or cross-counter against an over-pressuring opponent."
martialarts,3cqs20,Arkansan13,2,Fri Jul 10 03:13:46 2015 UTC,"That footwork works great but by itself won't do much if the other guy knows how to keep you in the corner.  If the guy is not overcommiting then you are only walking into another punch. He has you controled in a limited motion zone while he has a much bigger space to work with.  If he's chasing you or overcommits, it's perfect (just what happens in the video, chases instead of keeping the distance and working things from there).   Aldo uses pivots all the time (a bit different though) to escape his pursuers and they work beautifully for him.  If by circling you mean looking for angles, it happens in almost every professional fight.   If you don't know how to do that, you shouldn't be in a ring and despite that they end up in the corners a LOT.  The structure of the ring/cage makes the process different for every sport, and yet eventually somebody almost always ends up there, no matter how good they are, specially if you and your opponent both know that's the best place to neutralize your capabilities.  Edit: Typos"
martialarts,3cqs20,Arkansan13,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:48:49 2015 UTC,"If I end up walked into the ropes typically I'm looking for my opening to Pivot out. I use a lot of Pivots in general though so I'm pretty comfortable with it.  Typically I pivot out off of a slipped shot or a hard jab. It does seem to work best for me when I have them committed to a shot.  I use pivoting out in the center as well, if I get a guy that wants to plant up to throw and you can time them pivoting off a straight shot puts you in a really good position to hit and forces them to break ground."
martialarts,3cqs20,Arkansan13,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:22:28 2015 UTC,Can you compare the differences between ropes and the cage in your personal experiences? (in an MMA ruleset)  How much does it affect your style? Does it feel particularly weird to transition from one to the other?
martialarts,3cpjao,WeAreMachines,3,Thu Jul 9 19:11:21 2015 UTC,"That's a lot of good footage.   Questions:   Is competition a focus of your training, or just something you feel comfortable doing with your training? I'm not familiar with BJJ competition rules.  Are they not allowed to pick you up and slam you?  It seems like your choices put you in position to be slammed quite a bit. How long was the transition from white to blue? Did you have any prior training in other arts that you think made the transition easier?"
martialarts,3cpjao,stultus_respectant,6,Thu Jul 9 21:36:37 2015 UTC,Thanks alot. As far as your questions. 1. At first it wasnt but my coach being a high level black belt competitor steered the training in that direction as i started attending the advanced classes. And after my first tournament i fell in love with competition.  2. You cannot slam though if it were legal i would have done different things to prevent a slam. In the clips where im lifted off the ground one defensive counter to some one lifting you in the air is hooking there leg with your arm preventing them from picking you up. But since its competition i knew i didnt have to worry about that. 3. I was a white belt for 1.5 years now ive been a blue belt for 1.5 years altogether 3 years experience. 4. I had zero experience in grappling when i started besides watching mma. But i have always been somewhat athletic.  id be happy to answer any more questions. thanks for watching!
martialarts,3cpjao,stultus_respectant,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:44:22 2015 UTC,"Forgive my ignorance about the competition, but what is it that happens after they pick you up?  Do you get separated?  Do they have to put you down gently?  Are there penalties if they drop you?  Why did they pick you up at all?  Is it a psychological thing?   I was a white belt for 1.5 years now ive been a blue belt for 1.5 years altogether 3 years experience   Do you feel like this is an above average pace for someone to acquire the skill you have?  It seems very impressive to me as an outsider."
martialarts,3cpjao,Carlos13th,4,Thu Jul 9 22:03:31 2015 UTC,"If they slam you they get Disqualified and you win. This is to prevent injury as slamming could lead to concussion, Neck or back injuries and nothing fun haha. usually they will pick you up in hopes of the choke loosening up. When in this specific choke; the triangle choke, the way to defend is posturing up with your head high looking toward the ceiling. As long as in this posture you wont be choked but the triangle will still be locked and if your holding the guy up in the air youll probably start getting tired. When you get tired you put them back on the ground which is usually when the choke is finished because the posture is broken. for the full match : https://www.facebook.com/christian.feliciano.967/videos/vob.100000467515912/1087138187978421/?type=2&theater  It might seem that way as outsider but honestly ive been training atleast 5 days a week usually 6 for the last 3 years. Its taken a TON of hardwork and beatings to get to the level im at now But even now my coach smashes me like a white belt hahaha but thats what keeps me coming back for more. Youll never stop learning and theree will always be someone better then you. I highly recommend checking it out if you never have. Its changed my life more than any other experience."
martialarts,3cpjao,Carlos13th,2,Thu Jul 9 22:12:36 2015 UTC,"I think your progress is prett fast, but for good reason most people dont train 5-6 days a week so it makes sense that you progressed faster than someone who trains 2 or 3 times a week."
martialarts,3cpjao,Kintanon,2,Thu Jul 9 23:10:25 2015 UTC,Thank you. My goal is to be able to compete at black belt before im 30  so as of right now im on track.
martialarts,3cpjao,bobaf,2,Thu Jul 9 23:19:39 2015 UTC,Good luck mate.  A year of training 6 times a week is worth more than two years of training 3 a week. Because not only are you doing double the mat time you are building on stuff while its fresh. Not learning something then not getting to revisit it until next week.
martialarts,3cpjao,0xdeadc0deh,3,Thu Jul 9 23:22:03 2015 UTC,This is definitely true. Ive noticed that if im unable to keep a steady pace of training everyday ill either only plateu or decline in my technique. When i feel the most progression is when im able to train twice a day everyday. But then it starts wearing away my body haha. so once a day is like the safe zone for me as far as not over working my body
martialarts,3cpjao,bobaf,2,Thu Jul 9 23:23:52 2015 UTC,"I'm not familiar with BJJ competition rules. Are they not allowed to pick you up and slam you? It seems like your choices put you in position to be slammed quite a bit.   Slamming is illegal in most competitions. There are some competitions that award points and a restart standing if you lift your opponent above your waist from guard or while in a submission attempt.  Almost all competitors at blue and above will defend against the slam possibility by reflex just because, but technically it's illegal."

martialarts,3cohcu,Carlos13th,4,Thu Jul 9 14:29:03 2015 UTC,"Excellent highlight reel.  Not as stellar a record as the video might imply, but boy was he fun to watch, and it's always great to see technique being used to overcome physical disadvantages.  For example, here's my favorite Sumo wrestler of all time (and one of the biggest and tallest to ever compete) losing to Royce Gracie in a crossover MMA match.  In any case, Takanoyama's a decent fish-out-of-water story, but though he made it to the top flight 5 times, he never had a winning record there.  Fan favorite, to the credit of the sports' enthusiasts, in a country that can very biased against outsiders."
martialarts,3cohcu,stultus_respectant,2,Thu Jul 9 18:23:41 2015 UTC,Wasn't there some kind of drug scandal with him? I can't Remember the details so could be taking our of my Ass.  Yeah as ever highlight reels make people look like they never lose. Still a great video though.
martialarts,3cohcu,stultus_respectant,2,Thu Jul 9 19:01:43 2015 UTC,"Wasn't there some kind of drug scandal with him?    Do you mean while at the top flight, or later?  The only Sumo drug scandals I remember specifically were the pot busts and match fixing allegations in ~2008, which is well after Akebono's time.  That said, I can't say I was all that attuned into the sport; it's just something that's on TV a lot where I'm from.  Regarding generic issues, there were quite a few problems for Akebono, if I remember correctly.  He lost a lot of money on a restaurant, and on some ""personal"" issues.  He had to enter K1 just to clear some debt, but couldn't hang, and became a ""pro wrestler"".   Still a great video though.   Absolutely.  Very high ratio of technique for a Sumo highlight video."
martialarts,3cohcu,stultus_respectant,2,Thu Jul 9 19:11:41 2015 UTC,It was later. I believe he was taking something to gain weight if I remember. I could very well be wrong though.
martialarts,3cohcu,stultus_respectant,2,Thu Jul 9 19:19:48 2015 UTC,"Well, if you find anything, please pass it along.  I certainly hope it's not true, but I suppose even if it is, at least it wasn't during his distinguished Sumo career."
martialarts,3cohcu,stultus_respectant,2,Thu Jul 9 19:27:25 2015 UTC,So I mixed up my facts a but but after searching this is what I found. Apparently he was injecting himself with Insulin in an attempt to gain weight and got in trouble for it in 2011.  http://www.webcitation.org/636LJnUfc
martialarts,3cohcu,nastylittleman,2,Thu Jul 9 19:32:52 2015 UTC,"Oh!  Takanoyama!  I thought you were talking about Akebono.  Hehe, you had me legitimately concerned for one of my hometown heroes."

martialarts,3cmqf2,k_a_y,20,Thu Jul 9 06:07:23 2015 UTC,Yeah that's pretty dumb. They got beat by someone with a lot more experience than them. She just happens to be a girl.
martialarts,3cmqf2,dermanus,18,Thu Jul 9 15:13:23 2015 UTC,The more I see videos like this the more I realize I need to add some kind of grappling into my arsenal. I would've just flailed around trying to go for like a head lock. Using your legs to choke wouldn't even have occurred to me.
martialarts,3cmqf2,ash8795,2,Thu Jul 9 06:03:02 2015 UTC,"Well, no. You would probably have punched her in the face, because that's what strikers do. Don't get me wrong, if it was someone near your size or someone used to taking hits (which that girl might have been, but I honestly doubt it), you'd be in a lot of trouble, especially on grass... but I don't think learning leg chokes is necessarily the solution."

martialarts,3cmqf2,farkoman,3,Thu Jul 9 13:24:54 2015 UTC,"We do a fair few groundwork drills in class, and they're all aimed at getting up safely. I think it's much more important for a striker to learn a halfway-decent guard and escapes than mounts, side control, and guard passes."
martialarts,3cmqf2,--u-s-e-r-n-a-m-e--,3,Thu Jul 9 14:53:52 2015 UTC,Mount and side control are both very likely scenarios for self defense and sport. Guard is also very likely if you are against a grappler. Being able to escape/survive these is essential.
martialarts,3cmqf2,JasonYoakam,0,Thu Jul 9 17:42:14 2015 UTC,"Escape them, yes - but not perform them."
martialarts,3cmqf2,--u-s-e-r-n-a-m-e--,3,Thu Jul 9 20:35:35 2015 UTC,You need people who know how to perform them in order to learn how to escape them. In the same way if you are doing punch defense against fake unrealistic punches your are not training to defend a real punch.
martialarts,3cmqf2,Carlos13th,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:44:51 2015 UTC,I agree entirely. That's why I spend time with people who do like to grapple. A friend of mine visited his university's bjj club a few times just to make sure his escapes were good.
martialarts,3cmqf2,--u-s-e-r-n-a-m-e--,3,Thu Jul 9 20:49:56 2015 UTC,As a striker you need take down defense first and foremost. If you can stuff the take down and resume striking you will win.   Second to TDD you need to understand how to escape guard. BJJ fighters are going to pull guard. They will not end up in your guard.
martialarts,3cmqf2,ncguthwulf,3,Thu Jul 9 18:15:03 2015 UTC,BJJ fighters are going to pull guard.   If striking is involved this would not be most BJJer's first preference.
martialarts,3cmqf2,ConcreteShoeMan,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:55:34 2015 UTC,Doesn't matter actually. Any position on the ground is better than any position standing up.
martialarts,3cmqf2,anonlymouse,0,Fri Jul 10 10:07:50 2015 UTC,You sure? Guard + over wrap and begin attacking. Or just watch werdum in the ufc.
martialarts,3cmqf2,ncguthwulf,3,Thu Jul 9 19:36:43 2015 UTC,"I'ma throw you on your stupid head (you being the person attacking me, not /u/ncguthwulf) way more often than I'm going to pull guard.   Arm drags and single legs are super effective as a general rule when you aren't up against someone who is just flat out a better wrestler than you are."
martialarts,3cmqf2,Kintanon,2,Thu Jul 9 21:47:27 2015 UTC,"But you will pull guard against the person you can't throw, which would be someone who works their takedown defence. Most of the time that'll be someone good at takedowns themselves, so guard will be your choice."
martialarts,3cmqf2,anonlymouse,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:09:35 2015 UTC,In context of course. I love the kit Dale street fight videos where he jokingly goes to open guard as his first move...
martialarts,3cmqf2,ncguthwulf,2,Thu Jul 9 23:48:51 2015 UTC,"Usually we try to get in as dominant a position as possible before attacking. Sure, we train to fight off our backs but I'd much rather be on top in mount raining down elbows."
martialarts,3cmqf2,ConcreteShoeMan,2,Thu Jul 9 21:21:39 2015 UTC,This whole thing is out of context now. I was saying that as a striker to train to be ready for a BJJ guy make sure to know your take down d and your guard escapes.
martialarts,3cmqf2,ncguthwulf,2,Fri Jul 10 00:14:39 2015 UTC,Guarantee you Werdum would rather be in the mount if he could.
martialarts,3cmqf2,TNBK,2,Fri Jul 10 10:09:30 2015 UTC,"We do a fair few groundwork drills in class, and they're all aimed at getting up safely.   You also need to do drills focused on keeping people on the ground, otherwise you're not practising getting up safely against the right resistance."
martialarts,3cmqf2,anonlymouse,0,Fri Jul 10 10:05:17 2015 UTC,"They're sort of combined, I suppose."
martialarts,3cmqf2,--u-s-e-r-n-a-m-e--,2,Fri Jul 10 11:03:40 2015 UTC,"Not sort of, absolutely. You can't have one without the other. That's the case for everything. If you're at war, you might have soldiers do without, simply because it's a choice between training something or nothing. You might also do that for gun defence if restrictions on actual guns are so severe you can't train with them. But when it comes to doing a hobby and training unarmed, there's really no excuse to not do it properly."
martialarts,3cmqf2,anonlymouse,2,Fri Jul 10 11:10:48 2015 UTC,"Let me rephrase: our practice on keeping people on the ground is combined with our practice on escaping. We focus much more on escaping than we do on keeping people down. One of the senior students actually enjoys grappling and has studied it in a lot more depth, so he's the stress test for what we've practiced."
martialarts,3cmqf2,--u-s-e-r-n-a-m-e--,7,Fri Jul 10 11:25:40 2015 UTC,I honestly don't understand what you are trying to say.  Are you suggesting that he shouldn't add grappling to his knowledge because he can just punch a 16 year old girl?
martialarts,3cmqf2,ConcreteShoeMan,4,Thu Jul 9 13:52:35 2015 UTC,"I think he's a specifically addressing the ""flailing around like a monkey"" part. She is very good at jujitsu clearly (at least against completely untrained guys) but this is a friendly match with certain rules. A striker wouldn't be in as much of a disadvantage in a no rules match.   Grappling definitely helps because any fight can go to the ground. But its not fair to watch people specifically in a grappling match and think that you suck as a fighter because you can't compete with a grappler in that situation."
martialarts,3cmqf2,ronin1066,7,Thu Jul 9 14:14:45 2015 UTC,"I agree that you can't read too much into a video.   I will however point out that even if striking were allowed I wouldn't bet money against this girl.  Strikers with no grappling training, like the general population, are stupidly easy to put on the ground.  (Insert reference to early UFCs)"

Take your average wrestler with no striking experience and your average boxer with no grappling experience and put them on concrete. Bet you money the boxer at least breaks even.

Yeah, if you're on concrete a break fall will help a lot less, but even with the advantage of a hard surface to throw to, I'd rather be the boxer.   You'll also notice that being on a hard surface cuts down on the grappler's options a fair bit. Being in guard isn't fun on a hard surface and is downright painful on a rough one."

Being in guard isn't fun on a hard surface and is downright painful on a rough one.   Any grappler who pulls guard in a self defence scenario deserves whatever beating they will likely receive. The guard doesnt even exist in wrestling, wrestlers will close distance -> clinch -> takedown, which is what all those trained in BJJ will/should do anyway.  Regardless of surface, there aren't really other ""options"" for a grappler in a self defence scenario, against someone who doesnt know how to defend against grappling the traditional ""close distance -> clinch -> takedown"" is the only real plan of action"
martialarts,3cmqf2,JurgenTheNotSoGerman,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:00:23 2015 UTC,"I was assuming we were talking about more of a UFC-style match (although I did stipulate concrete because I may be a bit overconfident), rather than self-defense. There are a whole host of other reasons I'd rather be a striker than a grappler for self-defense."
martialarts,3cmqf2,--u-s-e-r-n-a-m-e--,2,Thu Jul 9 17:02:36 2015 UTC,Have you grappled on concrete? It hurts if you get picked up and slammed but other wise you can pretty much do anything you can do on mats you just realsie that you have lots of little cuts later but it doesn't prevent you doing grappling..
martialarts,3cmqf2,Carlos13th,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:48:35 2015 UTC,"Not since I started actually practicing a martial art, no. I suppose you're right, but I can't imagine anyone voluntarily doing it except in a self-defense situation, and there are much better options in a self-defense situation."
martialarts,3cmqf2,--u-s-e-r-n-a-m-e--,3,Thu Jul 9 20:55:56 2015 UTC,"It's not very hard to learn how to cover up while you go in for the clinch, especially on an average striker. She might already have trained this.    Many BJJ academies teach it."

If you were flaying football you could pick up the ball, run up the field, punch the goalie and throw it into the net, doesn't mean you won. You can play about and have fun with martial arts too."
martialarts,3cmqf2,shaolinoli,-4,Thu Jul 9 13:29:13 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah. That's kind of my point. You shouldn't watch a soccer match and say ""man, I really need to work on my kicks to improve as a football player."" Grappling is great. It's even fun, sometimes. But I don't think this video really makes a strong case for needing to learn to grapple to be a decent fighter."
martialarts,3cmqf2,--u-s-e-r-n-a-m-e--,7,Thu Jul 9 14:50:02 2015 UTC,"Nobody mentioned a no holds barred fight though so it's a bit of a redundant point. The video demonstrates really well what can be accomplished with decent technique, I definitely think it's a compelling display for someone wanting to round out their overall game. Also it's worth pointing out that, although the guys weren't striking, neither was the girl, she maintained a good dominant position throughout a lot of the video that I saw that would place her in a much stronger striking position than her opponent."
martialarts,3cmqf2,shaolinoli,-1,Thu Jul 9 15:31:16 2015 UTC,"Thats the point.  Shes beating them because she is better at grappling and they are only grappling.  If they were actually fighting, and a dude knew what he was doing, he would not be as outclassed from the start like they all were in the video, thats his point.  If me and my judo friend are slap boxing im probably gonna beat him because i have a lot of striking experience.  That doesnt mean hes not a good fighter, it doesnt necessarily mean he has to work on his striking more.  It just means when confined to one area he has less experience in, he isnt as good as I am."
martialarts,3cmqf2,2legittoquit,5,Thu Jul 9 17:26:37 2015 UTC,"You're just speculating by adding in elements that aren't seen and presuming an outcome. She's clearly comfortable in the combative situation, it's entirely possible that she's a competent striker as well. It doesn't matter either way though, I don't know why people feel the need to escalate these discussions to bring up mma/teh streetz, we saw an impressive by display of grappling in a friendly(ish) situation, strikes are not an issue in that context."
martialarts,3cmqf2,shaolinoli,5,Thu Jul 9 17:46:46 2015 UTC,"They bring up things that aren't there because it soothes their ego. Like the classic answer to being tapped six ways to Sunday in your first bjj class: ""yeah but I would have been alright if I could strike, you know?"". In this case they're seeing a young woman and thinking ""what if she could get me too?""."

martialarts,3cmqf2,Kintanon,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:44:37 2015 UTC,Maybe my point was too far removed from the original comment.  My point was that just because someone is better than you in one area doesnt make you bad.
martialarts,3cmqf2,2legittoquit,-2,Thu Jul 9 22:33:46 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah, but part of the reason she was in that dominant position is that they weren't hitting her.   As far as no-holds-barred fighting, why would he feel the need to improve his deficient grappling for any other reason? If he was planning to compete in pure grappling events, he would have already known he needed to learn to grapple."
martialarts,3cmqf2,--u-s-e-r-n-a-m-e--,5,Thu Jul 9 16:04:02 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty big assumption, she might be a better striker than them too.   Maybe he saw the video and was inspired to start grappling. Nobody thinks that focussing solely on one or the other is enough to be a competitive, well rounded fighter anymore."
martialarts,3cmqf2,shaolinoli,-1,Thu Jul 9 17:49:28 2015 UTC,"Women have, on average, about half the upper body strength of men. They also don't have any cultural factors pushing them to take up violent sports, and especially not aggressive ones. I'd be shocked, and I imagine you would too."

That said, the unstated premise here is at least partially something like; watch this girl whup on some guys using her BJJ skills, isn't BJJ fucking awesome!    Which is OK on its face, but it quite deliberately under-emphasizes the fact that these are obviously untrained rubes who have foolishly agreed to play by a rule-set for which they are completely unprepared.    In that sense, I'm not sure that it really shows us anything of value.  True, it shows us that BJJ can be used to neutralize and overcome an untrained opponent who has agreed to a grappling-only rule-set, but we already knew that, right?    What if one of those guys decided not to play by the rules?  When she's standing, several times the girl practically begs to be put in a Thai plum from where she would undoubtedly eat several game-ending knees.

When she's standing, several times the girl practically begs to be put in a Thai plum from where she would undoubtedly eat several game-ending knees.   In the same way that many traditional martial artists 20 years ago sneered at the idea that there was a grappling sized hole in their self-defense, it seems a lot of modern grapplers seem to be sneering at the idea that they're not automatically at an advantage in a fight.  I continue to have concerns that the competition side of grappling seems to negatively affect their understanding that the real world doesn't care much for rules.  I had a friend take some jerk to the ground and submit him, the guy wheezing and outright begging to be let free (he's sorry, etc), and who then promptly threw the world's largest haymaker at my buddy the second he stood up.  My friend ducked it, and others jumped in to break everything up, but it changed his perspective, and it took that moment to do so.  It had never occurred to him what's supposed to happen after you ""win"", or what that even means, and what if people just don't care about what you expect?  I know from experience they'll hit you with bottles, call out to their friends, and do things you never considered.  To your point:   I guess I worry that clips like this have the potential to send the wrong message.   As do I.  Thought it's the same as if I watched a clip of someone with equivalent striking experience doing some ""light sparring"" with a bunch of untrained friends, and similarly outclassing them.  A 17 year old with 10 years of Taekwondo would look amazing against his dumb friends.  That said ..   In that sense, I'm not sure that it really shows us anything of value   Well, I loved watching it.  It's always nice to see what training can do for you, and I think that the overwhelming majority of fights have at last one side untrained.  Also, it's good to see that the principles are universal enough that anyone can apply them (a counter to the machismo of some BJJ).  And who doesn't love seeing overconfident teens get rolled?"

martialarts,3cmqf2,VaranusNiloticus,3,Thu Jul 9 15:44:08 2015 UTC,Why does it need to be proving anything? It's entertaining watching trained vs untrained and it's a testament to the effectiveness of BJJ. On every video of this kind there's cunts who say this. It's valueless.
martialarts,3cmqf2,UberHard,2,Thu Jul 9 22:26:41 2015 UTC,"whoa, relax! first of all, I resent the cunt adjective, totally uncalled for. Second, I think my question is quite valid, and is derived from the title ""Girl completely destroys guy with JJ"" ... anybody can tell you it implies that there is a guy in the video trying to destroy her as well.   You would not post a video of a boxer punching a sandbag and promote it with ""Dude destroys punching bag in the gym"", right? I get that there is some entertainment value in watching this, but it is IMHO not a good nor fair example in what it tries to showcase.   While I must admit that I'm not 100% comfortable with how some BJJ (specially Gracie Jiu Jitsu stylists) I know from personal experience behave, and some of the civilian defense theories I practice clash with a few of the core concepts of this martial art, we need to listen and respect what these guys say, and that I will be the first in line to agree that BJJ has hands down, the best technique for ground fighting. I am not contesting in any way or form the effectiveness, merely making a comment that the video title suggests something different, and that it's unclear what it tries to show other than a trained individual will always have an edge over an untrained one."

Only some seems a bit flashy or weird.  He does two on one knife defences which is refreshing.  He seems to know a bit of everything, strikes, takedowns, defence, weapons, that is all good.  However you will never know how they train unless you go to the school and suss out what happens in a class.  As mentioned students need to spar.  They need to hit things, you can see they're hitting focus pads, that's a positive.  They have mats which means you're going to train grappling so that's another positive.  The grappling stuff was a little funky but quite self defence oriented, he didn't shy away from takedowns or the ground for example, but he included strikes and he mostly ended standing up at the end.  The price is normal for Australia.  I didn't like his tappy-tappy hubud knife stuff, and I didn't see any sparring or resistance work, of course that doesn't mean they don't do it but you should check it out yourself."

martialarts,3cpanp,Arkansan13,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:49:16 2015 UTC,Go there. Ask how often they spar at 75% or more speed and power.
martialarts,3cpanp,anonlymouse,0,Thu Jul 9 18:19:02 2015 UTC,"And if they do, turn around and leave. 75% power is more than enough to get you a concussion, and regardless what any tough guy will tell you that is not what sparring is for. Sparring should be a safe way to learn how to fight."
martialarts,3cpanp,Arkansan13,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:13:52 2015 UTC,I regularly spar at around 75% power with other non-beginner Krav guys.  With headgear and 16 oz gloves it isn't that bad.  I've had my bell rung hard a few times but I've never seen an actual concussion or anyone knocked out.   With a beginner?  No.
martialarts,3cpanp,anonlymouse,6,Thu Jul 9 22:42:43 2015 UTC,"If you've had your bell rung you've had a concussion, just not too bad of one. I learned this from my neurologist a few years back, I used to think a concussion required LoC or fairly obvious symptoms but it doesn't. In fact there is speculation that you could be concussed and be asymptomatic.  My rule on sparring with head shots these days is 30 percent power and as fast as you can throw and maintain that. Of course anything below the collar bone is thrown full tilt or next to it. Honestly the times I've stepped into hard sparring since then I haven't notice that it's made me any worse, in fact I think that in some respects I've gotten cleaner in my applications."
martialarts,3cpanp,Arkansan13,3,Fri Jul 10 01:58:07 2015 UTC,"You don't spar at 90%/100% every single time, but if you're not competing, you should at least spar at that intensity with similar frequency to someone who is, at least until you've gained some experience with it."
martialarts,3cpanp,anonlymouse,5,Fri Jul 10 09:47:34 2015 UTC,"I'm just not convinced anymore that hard sparring has to be all that frequent. It needs to be done from time to time as a reality check, but  I really think that for someone interested in self defense sparring with light contact to the head and full to the body is going to largely be good enough for their purposes.  The older I get the more skeptical I get of the conventional wisdom that even a fighter needs to hard sparring all the time. We just know to much about head injury to justify that anymore, and I'm not convinced that if everything else in your training is handled properly that a lack of near full contact head shots is going to entirely cripple your progress.  You need to be sparring, the sense of timing, distance, etc that it builds is just critical. However I'm just not sold anymore on the idea that head shots need to be all that hard all that often."
martialarts,3cpanp,Arkansan13,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:42:09 2015 UTC,"For sure. It doesn't have to be all the time, but it has to exist to some degree. You need to turn up the intensity to figure out if you're making mistakes. As long as you're recognising them and correcting them with lower intensity, there's no reason to ramp it up, but once you think you've got everything in place, that's when you really test it."
martialarts,3cpanp,ncguthwulf,2,Fri Jul 10 14:56:04 2015 UTC,"Oh I agree that hard sparring needs to come into play from time to time, my only issue is the frequency I see it at some gyms. I mean the boxing club my family no longer associates with didn't seem to understand that sparring night shouldn't mean ""gym wars"" three nights a week.  I think safety in sparring is one of the inherent advantages grappling has over striking. Sure injuries happen but it seems like head injuries are much less frequent. Particularly with BJJ."
martialarts,3cpanp,anonlymouse,2,Fri Jul 10 15:26:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that inherent advantage makes it very easy to recommend Judo and BJJ. It's pretty hard to fuck up, unless you end up training under a psycho. With striking, you need to look a little further to find a good place."
martialarts,3cpanp,user079,2,Fri Jul 10 15:36:47 2015 UTC,"Yep, I've been neglecting my grappling for years now. I've started trying to hunt down a Judo or BJJ club in my area that doesn't charge a small fortune."
martialarts,3cpanp,MyRoomAteMyRoomMate,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:37:59 2015 UTC,Exactly. I would run if they spar 75% day 1. I would also run if they never spar 75%.

martialarts,3coeuw,EnterOpen,3,Thu Jul 9 14:52:40 2015 UTC,"Very true, thank you.  I don't worry too much about it myself because at my level I have more than enough to work on. I'm concerned that the students that have been stuck at a lower belt grade for over a year are getting bored and frustrated with no new material to work on. Especially when they are making an effort to be present for class and put in the extra effort. I worry that we will start loosing students this way and I'm worried we already have."
martialarts,3coeuw,NeuroCore,3,Thu Jul 9 15:09:24 2015 UTC,"What happens when you all test together and some don't do as well as they need to? Do they fail while the rest of you move on? Or do you all fail? Or are they pushed through the test just to keep everyone together?  This is weird. While I understand wanting to develop a sense of comradre, you'll develop that within your classes and with your training partners. Keeping students together for the sake of keeping students together is what they do in the school system. If a person is ready to advance and they have the skill and time they need, they should absolutely be offered the opportunity to advance."
martialarts,3coeuw,BVKrustev,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:50:42 2015 UTC,"I have yet to see anyone fail a test. I am not qualified to judge weather or not they should have passed.  But I do know that if one person were to fail it would not have any impact on the other testers belt.  I feel like testing for belts really pumps some energy into the class, even for the higher belts who have a long way to go till their next belt. And if a student isn't ready to test and others are (and they pass) then it only motivates the student more to do better.  Having a goal to work toward is very inspiring. Not being giving an opportunity to accomplish your goal is aggravating and wears on your spirits.  I understand the importance of patience. I have never felt rushed to a belt and we take our time. But maybe it's just a little too much time? There's a fine line I'm sure."
martialarts,3coeuw,BVKrustev,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:16:50 2015 UTC,"I have not tested for that many belts in my life, I have either actively avoided it or I WA training a martial art with no Standart grading. However, if no one was failed in 5 years, thats a bit of a red light to me. Wherever I have trained with belts, the exams were even 6 months. If you want to test, you test. Your instructor tells you objectively if you are ready, but you can ignore him and tell him you are ready or that you will get there. I succeeded once and failed once in this manner. This force people to both evaluate themselves and not be forced to only let the great big teacher assess them. It can be a very good motivator if 3 months before the exam your senses tells you: ""You know, I am not sure if you can manage to get to that level in the remaining time""."

martialarts,3coeuw,MacintoshEddie,3,Thu Jul 9 21:45:12 2015 UTC,"Having been on both sides of this, allow me to add the following.  Most tend to want to rank test people in groups for efficiency and so that you have someone to work with.  1) Rank testing, especially Black Belt testing takes a while. I would not prefer to test someone for 3 - 5 hours, then turn around and do it again in two months if I can just wait the two mouths and get them both at the same time.  2) You need a partner to test with so you have someone to demonstrate your skills on/against. I mean sure, in a pinch, someone from the panel could dummy up for you, but then that person isn't evaluating you, they're being a dummy partner.  3) In my experience, comeraderie is a great part of training. It helps keep you motivated and honest AND most of my training partners became like family to me. However, I do not believe it can or should be forced.  Anyway, if there's an obvious skill gap between you and the people you're training with, to the point where you're head and shoulders above everyone and everyone knows it, then it's pointless to ask you to wait.   Talk to your instructor and bring this up in a respectful manner."
martialarts,3coeuw,NoOnesPrey,4,Thu Jul 9 16:07:04 2015 UTC,"My gym does testing once every three months, and whoever shows up and is ready to test gets to test and everyone else gets to wait for the next rotation.  Or in some cases, three years later they are still in that level because they never manage to show up to test."
martialarts,3coeuw,anonlymouse,2,Thu Jul 9 14:14:23 2015 UTC,"Same here. As a fairly dedicated student (no kids, flexible job, understanding wife) I think I would be pissed waiting for others to test with me.

In the past I have had to wait and have my test date continuously and unmercifully pushed back to wait for busier people to catch up. Meanwhile they're missing classes and I hadn't skipped once in many months.  Extremely frustrating, especially when one of the classmate dropped out!  Unfortunately I don't take my martial art as seriously anymore as I did when I was continuously testing for belts. I am really working on changing this. However in the back of my head wiggles this thought, ""When I'm ready to test am I going to be held back because my belt level partners are not putting in the same effort?"""
martialarts,3coeuw,blindside1,3,Thu Jul 9 15:16:20 2015 UTC,You can solve this problem by not training a style that has belts.

Challenge yourself to do your kata (if you have them) better than the rank ahead of you.  Make it obvious to your instructor and the rest of the school that you are different. Use this as fuel."

martialarts,3coeuw,LE_WHATS_A_SOUL_XD,2,Thu Jul 9 18:50:25 2015 UTC,Have you talked to your instructor about why this happens?  Is it some sort of passive aggressive way of trying to make students into instructors  and nudging the more dedicated students into tutoring those who fall behind?
martialarts,3coeuw,chengjih,2,Thu Jul 9 17:47:07 2015 UTC,That is interesting. This never occurred to me. Thanks for the insight!
martialarts,3coeuw,Ohshhhhmamas,2,Thu Jul 9 18:52:17 2015 UTC,"I don't know about common, when I was in Isshin-ryu and Goju-ryu the gradings were in a group.  When I was in Kajukenbo and Kenpo the gradings were individual.  I don't think it is a style thing, I think it is more of a ""convenient for the instructors"" thing.  If you need 2 hours to grade one student or three hours to grade 3 students for the same rank it is simply a matter of what is more efficient, particularly if you have a large school with lots of belts.    That said I much preferred the individual testing route, it let me proceed at my own pace and not wait for others who don't learn as fast or aren't practicing as much."

If he wants to get into self-defense when he gets older, he's got a good physical and mental basis for doing so.

martialarts,3cncwv,Sayrh,7,Thu Jul 9 06:26:47 2015 UTC,You want more exercises to get better at karate? The only solution is more karate.   Strength and conditioning is good too though.
martialarts,3cncwv,Hussard,3,Thu Jul 9 10:27:01 2015 UTC,If you can't go to a gym to do weight training start with bodyweight training. Strength is good for karate but conditioning is also very important (and sparring is generally an on / off thing where you need explosive power and stamina).  Try body weight training (/r/bodyweightfitness or take a look at this page). You can get quite far with that. Or alternatively buy yourself some short barbells to train at home.   Also as with all other sports nutrition is really important. See that your body has enough nutrition and especially that it has what it needs.  Also try to train a bit for yourself at home over August so that you don't get completely out of routine. ;)

Not trying to be dickish just that those things would help to legitimize your grappling classes.  When you say Ju-Jutsu do you mean traditional or BJJ ?
martialarts,3cng1n,Velisusi,0,Thu Jul 9 08:06:43 2015 UTC,"I'm not a high rank in either. I'm just helping get people in. Due to my experience as a high school wrestler, I'm really interested in helping him jumpstart the program to get more experience. Competition wise, we are traditionally more of a karate school, but I'm hoping to change that. We do traditional ju-jutsu."
martialarts,3cng1n,farkoman,3,Thu Jul 9 08:44:20 2015 UTC,"I'm confused. If you all hope to compete in grapple arts, such as judo, BJJ, or various ""open"" grappling formats (e.g. NAGA), you are going to need someone instructing the class who has competitive credentials.  Once you get that person, you can advertise on your website that you have a submissions grappling program taught by PERSON X and you can host seminars or workshops to bring new people in. You can also advertise clean, well-kept mats, which I hope you have.   You can also make some videos of folks in class having fun and doing silly stuff, which usually goes pretty far online. For example you could have 80s Day where instead of normal no-gi class, everyone wears old clothes from the 80s and you punch it up with some Miami Vice visuals (or whatever)."
martialarts,3cng1n,Carlos13th,0,Thu Jul 9 13:50:00 2015 UTC,"My sensei has competed in submission wrestling and sambo tournaments. He still be teaching the class, not me. Sorry for the confusion. I'm just a very interested student."
martialarts,3cng1n,farkoman,4,Thu Jul 9 14:58:08 2015 UTC,How did he do in those tournaments? Does he hold any grade in BJJ or Judo? How many years has he trained Sambo for?  These things are all important if he is going to be teaching. Someone not mentioning these kind of things on their website gives potential customers no idea of if the instructor is qualified to teach or not.  If he doesn't have those qualifications then just keep it as a Tradtional Jiu Jitsu class but start competing or have a competition class. See how your guys do at comp then go from there.
martialarts,3cng1n,yingyangchingchang,0,Thu Jul 9 15:53:37 2015 UTC,Thanks. I'll definitely pass it along to him. I'll keep it to strictly traditional ju-jutsu. I'll check for his records and look for competitions around us.
martialarts,3cng1n,MacintoshEddie,2,Thu Jul 9 16:46:08 2015 UTC,"He should be able to advertise around his credentials then, assuming the tournaments he won were significant and he's capable of replicating his success through his coaching.  Then again, maybe karate just pays the bills well and is his niche in the market. Making inroads into the grappling market could be challenging, especially if his competitors already have well-established programs in BJJ, judo, or sambo that produce competitors. In that case, it's going to be an uphill battle."
martialarts,3cng1n,JasonYoakam,0,Thu Jul 9 15:11:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we have Ground Control about 20 minutes away, so there is definitely some really good competition around. I was also thinking about having it blend into a self defense class. Which ever one people respond to more."

Any reason you've opted for dan ranks instead of the traditional mokuroku system?  I personally don't see the point in awarding certificates in Japanese if its not coming from a Japanese organization but if that's what you've chosen as your aesthetics and you have somebody who understands Japanese you can try websites like this one.  You can also ask over at /r/koryu.  There are some SMR people and maybe others who are part of independent dojo who have done the same."

In Brazil, you can carry a white weapon because they are not treated as weapon in the first place, but if you hurt someone with it your crime is taken as not only physical harm but also as attempted murder, if the victim survives.  edit: btw, if the police caught you with a knife they are most likely taking it away from you and giving what we call here a ""baculejo"", which is basically a beat because they think you're a thug or a robber lol"

The defender surprised the attacker in a doorway after running inside to escape, and hit him with the back of the axe to the side of the head. Sentence was originally 4 years, then reversed to release in higher court, and finally to 3 years in prison. The good thing is to know that the courts actually considered all aspects in the sentencing. The thing is readable, perhapas with google translate."
martialarts,3cj5in,SolarBear,-8,Wed Jul 8 16:34:45 2015 UTC,"IIRC it's similar in Canada. You have to somehow warn your attacker because you're considered armed if you know martial arts. If your opponent is unarmed, counter-attacking would be the same as picking up a knife of pistol. However if he's aware you're so ""armed"" then it's his/her own choice.  ""Stop, dude, I know kung fu!"" It's dorky as hell but hey, it's the law.  Still, IANAL, listen to one instead for some general, non-martial arts related self defense advice for Canadians."
martialarts,3cj5in,farkoman,7,Wed Jul 8 13:07:30 2015 UTC,"The link doesn't say anything about martial arts. It does say that Canadian law makes it difficult to make self-defense claims outside of your home or business, even if a crime is committed. The article states this is the ""grayest"" area of the law and that ""it comes down to whether the amount of force used could be considered reasonable, given the situation"" and that obviously is going to be really, really murky.  While you are right that the judge and jury may consider your background as a martial artist in determining whether the level of force was justified, telling the person you are about to beat up about your skillz as a martial artist is probably not going to affect the outcome of your case in any meaningful way whatsoever, and if the incident is recorded on video/audio, could conceivably make things worse (i.e. it's going to be much harder for you to downplay your martial arts expertise after avowing in public that you are Billy Badass)."

I guess if you have a legal background this is easier to research. In the meantime I'm stuck between believing a martial arts instruct I know and trust but who's not a lawyer, obviously, and some random internet guys who might or might not know what they are talking about. Color me confused."
martialarts,3cj5in,mattBernius,4,Wed Jul 8 14:08:31 2015 UTC,"In the meantime I'm stuck between believing a martial arts instruct I know and trust but who's not a lawyer, obviously, and some random internet guys who might or might not know what they are talking about.   Then it's incumbent upon you to ask your instructor where he is getting his knowledge from. Way too much in the martial arts is oral history and folk knowledge passed down from instructor to instructor.   So you end up people believing that their art has been practiced since the Shaolin temple or that you need to register your hands as deadly weapons.  Going back to the article (which I'd honestly use as my basis), it's important to note that there is a fundamental difference between a citizens arrest (where part of the issue comes up) and basic self-defense with duty to retreat. Here's really all you need:   CBC News: If we ever fear our family is in danger in public, do we have the right to defend them, even if the threat is a perceived one?  *** Nichols says this is the greyest area of the law, but, ""unless the person was actually taking some sort of action, or was using some kind of assaultive force, you wouldnât be justified in doing too much.""  Cohen says if a person reasonably believes a potential threat is imminent, and a judge agrees with the reasoning, then they would likely not be penalized for their actions. ***  ""It's more difficult for Canadians to understand because it seems more people are involved in this type of situation in the United States,"" he said.  The so-called perceived threat and the level of response is part of the practical reality that surrounds the law in these situations, Cohen says.  *** ""Thereâs no necessity to retreat, as depending on the circumstances, it [defending yourself] could have been the right thing to do."" ***  *** It comes down to whether the amount of force used could be considered reasonable, given the situation. Cohen says, for example, ""if you were getting out of your car and some young kid came up to you and started bugging you for money, and you didnât give it to him and he became aggressive, the law wouldnât support you if you beat them senseless."" ***  CBC News: Under what circumstances in Canada is the use of lethal force allowed?  Again, Nichols says the decision is in the judge's hands, and is made on a case-by-case basis.  ""It all comes back to what is reasonable in the circumstance,"" she says. ""A judge would have to find you had no other choice.""   [Emphasis added to highlight the key parts]  Basically, (a) there needs to be a clear and immanent threat (you need to perceive a serious threat and be in a situation where you cannot easily retreat) and (b) you need to respond with a general force continuum (i.e. just because some dude is throwing you shade you cannot break their neck).  Without a doubt, as a martial artist, you will be more highly scrutinized than the average Joe. But that's not the same as having to give a person a warning."
martialarts,3cj5in,farkoman,7,Wed Jul 8 15:12:02 2015 UTC,"Your instructor is providing you bad information.    You have to somehow warn your attacker because you're considered armed if you know martial arts.    No you are not considered armed according to the law, though depending on what you do, it could be considered armed assault (even indirectly, such as tripping them so they fall on concrete or punching them into a barstool so they accidentally break their arm).   Moreover, warning someone doesn't magically make the use of force justified. Otherwise we could run over pedestrians after providing them fair warning.   However if he's aware you're so ""armed"" then it's his/her own choice.   That's preposterous. It's your choice how you respond in a use-of-force situation. According to the article you supplied, if you respond with more force than the judge and jury think was reasonable, you are going to rot in a Canadian slammer."

martialarts,3cj5in,M3atboy,3,Wed Jul 8 15:06:36 2015 UTC,"In Canada its illegal to attack someone, even if they are on your property or committing a crime. Sure if they attack, threaten or assault you can prevent it, but you can't just bushwhack someone because they broke into your shed.   -Source, co-workers wife is RCMP and this has come up more than a few times."
martialarts,3cj5in,farkoman,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:40:19 2015 UTC,"Just a heads-up for American readers. Laws vary state by state. In some states you can probably shoot just about anyone in your house so long as the jury believes you perceived that person as a real and immediate danger. Texas would be one of those states.  In other states you have an obligation to retreat and if you don't you can be tried for assault, or much worse. Massachusetts would be one of those states.  So don't assume the ""castle doctrine"" until you've checked your state and local laws. Also, most laws see your house as something different than your property. Someone who broke into your shed is probably going to be more difficult to confront (from a legal vantage) than someone who broke into your house. If the someone is on your porch I have no fricking idea what the law thinks!"
martialarts,3cj5in,mattBernius,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:14:11 2015 UTC,From a pure self defense perspective there is a major difference between self defense and stopping a  nonviolent  crime in progress (even in the US).

martialarts,3cj5in,eddie964,3,Wed Jul 8 21:01:07 2015 UTC,"Regardless of what the law says (whether you're in the U.S. or Canada), there's a good chance a martial artist will wind up facing a civil lawsuit if he or she injures someone in a confrontation. A warning is one way to protect against that.  Think about it this way: You're in a bar where someone is being belligerent and picks an argument with you. You try to talk him down. You sidestep when he reaches out and tries to push you. But then he takes a swing, so you do your kung fu or jiujitsu or boxing or whatever, and next thing you know the guy is lying on the ground with a missing tooth and a torn rotator cuff.  Open-and-shut case of self defense, right? Maybe, but it may not look like that in court. The guy you injured claims you started the fight, and all the witnesses can say for sure is that the two of you were arguing and suddenly the other dude was on the floor crying for mama.  Whose side is a judge or jury going to take? Flip a coin.  Suppose, however, that you had loudly warned the dude not once, but three times to back off because you're a trained martial artist. Yes, everyone in the bar thinks you're a total tool. But ... you've made it almost impossible for the plaintiff to claim you were at fault."
martialarts,3cj5in,farkoman,3,Wed Jul 8 21:04:27 2015 UTC,"Regardless of what the law says (whether you're in the U.S. or Canada), there's a good chance a martial artist will wind up facing a civil lawsuit if he or she injures someone in a confrontation.   100% agreed and upvoted. The court can be more dangerous than the street. Note that most folks on this sub may not understand the difference between a criminal case and a civil case. You can win your criminal defense case and lose the civil case, which is what happened to O.J. Simpson after he murdered his wife.    A warning is one way to protect against that.   Not sure I agree with you there. Warning the guy that you are a trained martial artist is only putting on the public record that you have tools and skills your opponent does not. Since juries don't understand how hard it is to control someone without seriously hurting them, they may think any injury you caused them was gratuitous. Furthermore, the jury may be biased against martial artists and feel most of them are training specifically to beat people up and are thugs.   you've made it almost impossible for the plaintiff to claim you were at fault.   Quite the contrary. By proclaiming your martial arts skills, you could be seen to be threatening a beat-down. When someone is threatened, then they can claim self-defense against you, which is exactly what you want to avoid. By advertising your ability to hurt them, you are creating a credible, believable threat which can be used against you in court.  NOT recommended.  Instead, you should get loud about how threatened you are and how your life is at risk. Something like CALL THE POLICE! EMERGENCY! THIS MAN IS GOING TO KILL ME!   Of course if you don't have time for that do what you have to do to escape, including, if the situation calls for it, striking first and striking hard."

If a regular joe throws a punch in self defense and breaks some guys nose.  He is going to be able to honestly tell the jury, I was just throwing something out there hoping for the best, I didn't mean to necessairly break his nose.  A 20 year veteran martial artist however, will have a significantly more uphill battle and an implicit preception (right or wrong) that they had more control of a fight than the lay person.  TL;DR:  It will not make charges worse but it will color the perception of everyone in the process; from the police, to the DA charging you, to the judge, and jury.  So act responsibly."

martialarts,3cj5in,MacintoshEddie,2,Wed Jul 8 16:08:15 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I haven't heard of that particular one before.  I think this one may have been the result of an instructor not wanting his students to get in unnecessary fights and not quite being able to articulate that expressing a desire to avoid conflict tends to make you look a bit better if you ever get in a self defense scenario.  People get some huge blind spots regarding stuff their instructor says and does, taking it as gospel.  Sometimes the instructor is not a lawyer or skilled public speaker, so their understanding and intent are not always apparent.  Just because someone can teach you how to punch doesn't mean they know anything about anything else, but for some reason a lot of people are hardwired to think they do.  Which is where we get actors and musicians being seen as experts in stuff like particle accelerators and nuclear reactors.  I was told that if I have the opportunity to talk someone down and avoid going physical it is best, but that in no way means I have to croak out ""I don't want to hurt you."" as someone strangles me.  There's a bit of a hazy line between not wanting your students to let themselves be victimized, and not wanting them to turn into attack dogs at the slightest provocation."

martialarts,3cj5in,T3chnopsycho,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:52:44 2015 UTC,I'd say it comes from the fact that in some places if you get into a fight and knock the other guy out or injure him in some way (even if it was self defense) you will be on the negative side because you are trained in martial arts. So basically if you state you are that and the other person still engages you he couldn't make that claim anymore.   But AFAIK there is no law demanding that.  Also that guy is a real idiot. Just embarrassingly stupid. And the woman is a stupid bitch for even complaining.   And the busdriver should have just called the police to resolve the issue.

I've been advised multiple times that the best thing you can do is play it down and when asked after it happens, respond in kind: ""I don't know what happened, I was attacked and then i just reacted and I don't really remember what happened"" will cover your arse when their legal team decides to try and tear it apart in court by making you out as a lethal weapon.  It also helps to NOT mention your continued participation at classes, ever!  ""I've taken a few classes before"" is enough.  This may be different in other countries but in Australia this is very much the way it is, and that is because most people who are not inclined to understand the martial arts believe the mysticism surrounding it, which means we can subdue people with simple nerve strikes and so forth."

I was explained a case in which 1 man knocked out 4 attackers in a grocery store and was the one charged with assault, because these 4 men were the ones out cold on the ground, and while he was let off it validates my point that circumstance does not always matter to the police, it is the outcome that matters."

The reason to be concerned with this is not that you are at risk of perjury, but out of a fear that it will establish you to be an unreliable/lying/hostile witness. And, if you are in a situation where its your word versus theirs, then you've potentially just screwed yourself. Trust me, this is a standard tactic for prosecutors and tort lawyers.

You didn't inflict as little damage to save yourself as possible, in their eyes you've brutally assaulted someone and you knew exactly what you were doing, and could have handled it better.          What you have to realize, is that the law has a specific condition called excessive force.  If you knock someone out cold and cause any damage because they attempted to attack you, it is at the officer's discretion as to whether or not you have broken that aspect of the law and should be taken in to custody.  Handing him, on a platter, the information that could easily nail you in a court of law is basically saying ""Yes, arrest me, I want to be convicted"".  Sorry mate, but I'd rather avoid court altogether by playing it down than brag and expect people to believe my word when there is somebody in a bloody heap on the ground because ""He started it"", it just doesn't work that way.   a) you volunteer as little information as possible   Because if your opposition's legal team cannot find that information then you are better off, you forget that things like shock and intoxication come into play at the scene...""Why did you not disclose this information, sir?""

So basically you are advocating to lie and then hope that  a ""shock defense"" will be enough to convince a jury or a judge (depending on the type of trial) to explain the lie (i.e. saying that you've only had a few martial arts lessons when you have been studying for year). An aggressive prosecutor will eat that up. It's not worth the risk.  Again, you don't volunteer any martial arts training.

I know a number of lawyers. I have regular conversations about these type of topics. And because I'm interested in (and occasionally teach) self defense, I've actually had discussions about what to do in the aftermath. I can (and do, see below) quote (a) statute, (b) precedent, and (c) strategic advice (for both criminal and torte cases).  That's why I object to falling back to saying ""this is what I was advised to do"" when the people who are doing the advising don't understand the law.  Granted, I'm not a UK citizen (or possibly Australian, I don't have enough info to guess where you are posting from), but I know enough about legal systems from research to guess at how the prosecutorial process works where you are.  If it seems that I'm coming across hard on these things, its mainly because I think the moment we cross over into giving legal advice (or anything to do with self defense) we cross a pretty important moral threshold.

A lot of times many of these cases would go a lot more smoothly if the defendent would just let their lawyer do the talking. Most people suck at articulating why they do stuff.  A good example is a man punching a baby.  There is a significant disparity of force, the punch respresents an immediate and lethal threat to the baby.  In most jurisdictions you would be well within the law to shoot the man to prevent him from hurting the baby.  Is a man who would punch a baby an asshole?  Probably, but when that case goes to court if you get on the stand and get asked ""Why did you shoot that man?"" and your response is ""Because he was an asshole."" you may have very well scuttled your own case.  Without knowing the details of that case, maybe the guy was trying to be a smooth criminal and rob the grocery store and his four attackers were trying tiostop him.  Or maybe he was shit talking people and instigating the fight and both sides claimed self defense.  Or maybe it was legitimate self defense and when asked why he knocked out those men he replied ""Because they were assholes."""
martialarts,3cj5in,Shortaus,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:22:48 2015 UTC,"Can you give a link to a report on that case, or the dates/names?   No I can't because I wouldn't know where to look for the details, it happened a long time ago and it was presented to me by an instructor who was the expert witness for the case (he mentioned Top Gun as a reference to the year if that helps, so a long time ago).  In any case, I wasn't using that as a method to convince anyone, I don't particularly care what people choose to believe (being of a JKD background my back is to the wall most time), I'm simply discussing the OP's question.         A good example is a man punching a baby.   That's a poor example mate...punching a baby?  That actually happened in Australia recently and the man was charged without question...there is no excuse for that.  Why it is a poor example, is because as I just said there is no excuse or reason behind it, the man being attacked by 4 people was inside a petrol station.  Self defense is a reason, and regardless of circumstance you still have to prove that you were indeed defending yourself at the time, which is made easier by cameras and such...this goes for the guy who punched a baby.         maybe the guy was trying to be a smooth criminal and rob the grocery store and his four attackers were trying tiostop him.   For the record, his wife and children were in the car waiting for him to bring them out some snacks, don't you think the shop clerk would have verified these details when the police attended the scene?  Sorry, but it seems like you haven't given this much thought, that's all."

Sorry, but it seems like you haven't given this much thought, that's all.   It would have been helpful if you had mentioned these details in the initial post.  Maybe it's different in your jurisdiction, in Canada defense of a third party such as a baby is a legitimate extension of self defense.  Some places may have a different name for it, maybe ""defense of person"".  Over here ""self defense"" is not a reason, it is your argument as to why what you did was justified.  It is saying ""Yes I did assault that man, but I did it to prevent him from punching the baby."".  You are making the prosecutor's case for them and then relying on your justification for your actions to prove that your actions were necessary and justified.  For the baby thing, just to clarify the guy punching the baby is not claiming self defense, the guy who shot the guy who was punching the baby is claiming self defense because he was acting in the baby's defense.  So if I'm walking down the street and come across an alley where some lady is getting mugged and unable to defend herself, I can run over and help her and even though I am assaulting the person assaulting her what I am doing is self defense on her behalf."

I don't see how...I mentioned that it was in a store, which guarantees witnesses to the fact that he was not robbing the store (including the clerks).   Maybe it's different in your jurisdiction   It definitely is...guns are outlawed here, and I wouldn't have it any other way.   Over here ""self defense"" is not a reason, it is your argument as to why what you did was justified.   This is the same for us, and I think you have missed the point.  It is all about ""your word vs theirs"" and circumstance.  If you are assaulted by 4 men and you put all 4 of them into a coma, yes you have defended yourself, and yes you have used excessive force, you have to prove that the damage you cause in defending yourself was warranted, itt has nothing to do with proving you were defending yourself, that part is not hard nowadays given that most places have cameras, and also witnesses that can help.  Having training shows that you have a level of control and proficiency in hurting people, and the more damage you cause the harder it is to justify it when you have had training.  I'm not in any way saying self defense isn't warranted or illegal, I am saying that taking the steps to ensure that the law does not turn against you f or doing it should be your number one priority, which includes speaking to your own lawyer, avoiding a full blown confession of your training until questioned under oath, etc."
martialarts,3cj5in,eddie964,-3,Thu Jul 9 14:51:55 2015 UTC,"In the United States alone, any laws requiring disclosure of training would potentially be different in all 50 states.  That said, it might be reasonable legal advice to suggest that someone not only warn an opponent about their training, but also to do it multiple times. It would be hard for a plaintiff to argue in court that he/she didn't hear or understand the defendant's warning if it was repeated three times.  So, if there is some legal reason to disclose that you're a martial artist to a potential opponent, I suppose it's probably a good idea to tell people to say it three times."

It would be hard for a plaintiff to argue in court that he/she didn't hear or understand the defendant's warning if it was repeated three times.   I'm not sure if its necessary to disclose your training information. It's far more important to loudly state things like ""you don't want any trouble"" and ""let's calm down and talk this out"" while doing things with your hands that back up those actions.  Its far more important to demonstrate that you are (a) not the aggressor in the situation and (b) you are trying to deescalate things than worry about disclosing your training.  To that point, I wouldn't even say phrases like ""I don't want to fight"" and especially not ""I don't want to hurt you."" Either of those could be construed as threats (as backwards as that sounds)."
martialarts,3cj5in,eddie964,2,Wed Jul 8 16:59:23 2015 UTC,I hear you. My larger point was that you can't assume that a clear-cut self-defense case will look like one in court. That's why it's important to make it clear before witnesses that you're not the aggressor.

Because you have more knowledge of combat than the defendant.    No, unless I missed something obvious, this is is patently untrue. No where is this mentioned under Assault with a Deadly Weapon in California's penal code (CAL. PEN. CODE Â§ 245).  At best, excessive force causing great bodily injury with a fist could qualify under 245 -- however one's martial skill does not influence this in California, it's solely based on the level of damange.   It's real. Look it up.   I did.   It's not.   And again, this is exactly what I mean about Martial Arts people claiming that they know the law, when they have absolutely no idea of what they are talking about. What's sad is that the statutes are a matter of public record and still people cannot be bothered to check.  BTW, here's a primer on the topic that surveys a number of penal codes across the states: http://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/the-human-body-a-deadly-weapon.htm"
martialarts,3cj5in,Blackbelt_joe,0,Wed Jul 8 19:39:44 2015 UTC,"And this is where all you normal people get in trouble. In California, there is also something called 'excessive force'. You might not get charge criminally by the State. But that guy you beat up sure can sue the crap out of you in civil court for 'excessive force' in tort. Lawyers find all kind of ways to make money. In criminal court, they need 100% certainty to get the charge through. In Civil... they only need 75%. So go and be a hothead, break some arms and snap some necks. Don't worry, they hit you first! Totally okay to defend yourself and bulldoze the 'bully' who doesn't know any MA or SD because you know, being a dick to you is a warrant to get beat up into a cripple because they mess with someone who knows how to do MA right? This law is important."

Because you have more knowledge of combat than the defendant. It's real. Look it up.   That is simply not the case. Civil law is something entirely different, but even in civil law I have yet to find any mention of the ""trained fighter"" statute you claimed exists.  Ultimately, all this demonstrates is that, as I've said numerous times, if you are involved in a self defense altercation where you seriously injure someone, you should immediately consult a lawyer."
martialarts,3cj5in,Blackbelt_joe,0,Thu Jul 9 16:53:51 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, btw. Also please please please know that the court is run by people. Laws are interpreted by both sides of the parties. So just cause you think you know the law by reading it on the internet and googling, does not mean you can out corner an experienced lawyers who is specialize in tort. There is going to be a hearing and you will have to be question in front of the judge, there are a lot of elements that goes into a lawsuit. In general, in common eye, when someone got injured greatly by another. The injured always are favored despite being the aggressor because we are a sympathetic society. And because of this cultural norm, tort lawyers make good money on this kind of case. I'm not saying that you can't win this case. I'm just saying that its better to just walk away when there is confrontation. Pride and ego means nothing when you have to go through lawsuit."

And that's why you need to consult/retain a lawyer in that situation -- especially for civil court. Anyone who attempts to defend themselves in court for anything as serious as civil damages suit is a fool.   The injured always are favored despite being the aggressor because we are a sympathetic society.   Bull. It entirely depends on context -- which a good lawyer is able to help tease out. If you have a clear record and you end up hurting, in self defense, someone with multiple run-ins with the law, the fact is things will typically work out.  That said, if you have a rap sheet and they have a rap sheet, then there are issues. Or if you use a disproportionate amount of force then there are issues. But the fact is that in the US, things typically are in the favor of the defender.   (And I speak this as someone with a number of connections to both the criminal and civil law systems).  Beyond all that, the fact still stands that there is no law on the books in California that suggests that because you have martial arts training you are ""classified as a trained fighter"" and ""listed as a deadly weapon.""  My issue is with that claim, which was utterly false from the perspective of the penal code. And my issue is people giving self defense legal advice who don't actually know the letter of the law."

I still find it unlikely that a parents who'd take their kid to get the snot knocked out of him by trained professionals has taken all the steps to teach them the lesson in question without violence.

I have yet to see the video of someone using pure Tai Chi in a real fight and do anything substantial. The old classic stories always seem to be using Tai Chi against other Tai Chi practitioners.

martialarts,3chbma,Little_Johnny20,2,Tue Jul 7 22:25:04 2015 UTC,"This is an old comic cover and I was surprised both by how well depicted Superman's hand are while tying the choke and also by Wonder Woman's reaction that seems to be a takedown leading into side control while trying to control his face.  If you have alternate names for the choke and the defense, they're most welcome. I know it could also be a guillotine but the position of the arms seems way off.  https://youtu.be/er6ogjBVveI?t=24  Here's a similar front choke but the arms are not completely there either."
martialarts,3chbma,Carlos13th,3,Tue Jul 7 22:26:22 2015 UTC,It looks like a side headlock or bulldog choke. Though they are rarely that front on.
martialarts,3chbma,Joseph_Santos1,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:32:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I thought about that one too. It could be a front one that got displaced due to the defense."
martialarts,3chbma,ModeratorsAreDouches,2,Tue Jul 7 22:35:25 2015 UTC,"It looks like he was entering with a bulldog choke, but Wonder Woman threw him off balance."
martialarts,3chbma,Duffelson,2,Tue Jul 7 22:59:53 2015 UTC,"This is kinda neat, but also sorta dumb, because if you were Superman you'd never learn to fight like a humanbeing. You wouldn't need to. Why choke someone when you could literally rip their head off?"
martialarts,3chbma,ModeratorsAreDouches,5,Wed Jul 8 06:24:37 2015 UTC,"Because Wonder Woman is one of the few people in DC universe that can take a punch from superman.  Also Superman is notorious for never using his full strenght, so getting a good choke and slowly increasing the pressure is pretty good idea."
martialarts,3chbma,hkdharmon,0,Wed Jul 8 10:18:19 2015 UTC,"It's true that Superman doesn't use his full strength, but even so he wouldn't ever need to do a choke. He could just hold someone by their wrist. There would be no situation where he'd be required to choke someone. And he can fly. Wonder Woman can't. He could grab her by the ankle, and dangle her in the air. After that what could she do?   Or he can just fly around the Earth, in reverse, and turn back time. He could avoid situations altogether. He's basically a living God. He has no need for rear naked chokes, or armbars, or any Jiu Jitsu whatsoever."
martialarts,3chbma,anonlymouse,7,Wed Jul 8 12:19:04 2015 UTC,"And he can fly. Wonder Woman can't.   Wonder Woman flies and is one of the strongest characters in the DC universe. Superman would likely have to out-fight her. However, this was likely not true when that cover was drawn."
martialarts,3chbma,LeifEriksonisawesome,3,Wed Jul 8 15:39:13 2015 UTC,He's basically a living God.   So is Wonder Woman.

martialarts,3ciy1m,Wyes,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:41:24 2015 UTC,"Well I tried Kendo for about 6 months a few years back and I just couldn't afford to keep going. It was one of the most rewarding things I have ever gotten to do. Now, I have gained quite a bit of weight and I would like some way of reducing that while also getting that same rewarding feeling.  Any ideas?"
martialarts,3ciy1m,Wyes,3,Wed Jul 8 09:17:08 2015 UTC,"If you're looking for a competitive sport, you should try finding another kendo or sport fencing school.  Kenjutsu schools themselves have bit of a bad reputation for not doing any sparring, making it perhaps not ideal for exercise. I'm sure there are exceptions to this, however. You'll have to wait for someone else to comment on that.  Other options include hand-to-hand martial arts in general (even a boxing gym will do the trick). Otherwise it's probably worth checking out the various HEMA (Historical European Martial Arts) groups in Melbourne if you're interested in swords specifically. There are probably also arnis/eskrima/kali schools that may capture your interest. Any of the former are very likely to engage in rigorous sparring and some will include an exercise regime."

Kendo clubs by and large make it as cheap as possible, they are almost always non-profit.  If you are really interested in Kenjutsu, check out Melbourne Koryu Kenyukai.  They are a legit branch for Tatsumi-ryu, as far as I can tell."

martialarts,3ci48c,JIVEprinting,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:15:27 2015 UTC,"It seems to me, though, that when I'm tired towards the end of a match, my exhaustion is primarily related to cardio endurance rather than the endurance of my skeletal muscles. And I think that this makes sense when you consider that you'll rarely, if ever, punch something in a way that matches the resistance of a heavy bench press or kick something with the same resistance a squat would give you."
martialarts,3ci48c,--u-s-e-r-n-a-m-e--,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:00:34 2015 UTC,"True, but if you're punching and kicking, you're using explosive power. And muscular endurance is needed to maintain that power. Granted, power isn't quite the same as strength. The program described in that article seems ideally designed for wrestling or grappling, but I think it's still applicable to striking arts as well (you need to be strong to be powerful, after all). And with some modifications, you could turn a strength endurance workout into a power endurance workout."

I like the retro Street Fighter 2 themes to get the blood flowing as well for a quick couple minutes on the bag before class. Balrog and Ryu are my personal favorites.   Any of the boss fight themes from Metal Gear Rising are awesome over the top battle theme music as well with lone warrior type themes. This guy's remix of the first boss theme has a great slow burn vocal/acoustic start before hitting the gas for 5 minutes. I use it pretty often for HIIT sessions.  For a longer session, something I've had on rotation for a long time is Paul Oakenfold's Essential Mix Shanghai. Has a really good mix between quieter interlude beats, some in-the-zone trance type tempos, and some really intense hard paced segments for cranking it up."
