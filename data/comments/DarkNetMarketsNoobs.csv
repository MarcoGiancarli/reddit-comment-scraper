DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3e4g09,alhooda,4,Tue Jul 21 23:58:53 2015 UTC,"Where you are, is sending coins to a money laundering service legal though? By this thinking, some here do not tumble as a matter of course.   It is possible law enforcement in your country will one day gather enormous power and punish everyone who purchased contraband on the DNMs. The likelihood is very small. You should be more concerned with the mailman delivering your packages to the wrong house, where neighbors with a vendetta reside. Easy work for an officer of the law.   Here is how you ruin your life: i). purchase illegal drugs at a DNM, ii). hand them out at a party, telling everyone where you got them, iii). wait for one of your peers to get arrested, iv). go home and wait for the police.   Keep reading friend. Keep learning. Good luck."
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3e4g09,Tiaranu,5,Tue Jul 21 23:14:03 2015 UTC,"Wow, you are WAY overthinking this. How exactly is your ""real identity ... plainly linked to multiple purchases""?  The only way that anybody could track it back to you IRL is if they had the complete records from coinbase (which is the only step in the chain where your real name and address are stored [assuming that you pgp'ed your info on the DNM and that vendor/market deletes the records]). And if the coinbase information ever becomes public, 1 BTC worth of transactions being sent to a DNM with hundreds or thousands of different products including some that are innocuous is going to be totally overlooked.    Learn your lesson, do better next time, and keep on truckin."

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3e4kkp,_opsec_,2,Tue Jul 21 23:00:57 2015 UTC,Did you download directly to a USB?  Did you verify the ISO before download? If you answered yes to both then you are going to have to use a second USB to install a persistence.  If you downloaded the ISO to a DVD then go to Applications -> Tails -> Configure Persistent Volume.  Follow the steps and choose all the folders you want saved.  You'll do the same with the second usb. Good Luck!  If you want one on one time you can check out /r/opsectutorials.

If you do go check the box, and the package is there, it all depends on how scared you are. If you do bring it home, do not open it. Just throw it on the table and act like you forgot about it. Then a few days later when they knock on your door looking for drugs, they won't find them. You would say you didn't open the package and weren't expecting a package and had no idea what was in it. That's not guaranteed to save you though, especially if they have already intercepted a different package. I would think they would be continuing to watch your PO box from now on."

The idea of stealth is to make it blend in with normal mail so the vast majority of vendors would not go out of the way to do packing specifically for you.

That way instead of getting your real IP address they just get the VPN's.  And that's crazy. Damned if we do and damned if we don't.

If you sign in with username A (clearnet) and then sign in with B (darknet)  it'll show them both signed in from the same ip and can mean that you are both the same.  2- WIFI passwords will save once you get the persistent working and select the option to save network settings.  It should connect automatically after that if you save the password.  If you haven't set up persistence already.  Anything you do now till you do set it up may be lost  3- You said you installed onto a USB - you'll want to configure the persistent on that USB.  From there, setting up a persistent on a second USB WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF MEMORY, will serve mostly as a backup in case the first USB gets corrupted.    edit:  I should also add for #2 - you shouldn't have to setup an admin password each time to get wifi to work and I would leave the settings on default and let it spoof the addresses.  Again, as said above, once you get persistent to work it should connect automatically."

Electrum will also automatically generate fresh addresses in a wallet as you use them.  All your addresses under a wallet are linked on the electrum servers, so you should not use dirty coins and clean coins in the same wallet."

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3do8jb,deezyyyy,2,Fri Jul 17 22:48:32 2015 UTC,"All transactions within a wallet are linked, even on different addresses, simply because the way electrum works by not downloading the whole blockchain, your wallet info is stored on servers.  So yes, there is a security benefit of using a new wallet everytime as none of your transactions would be linked (at least by electrum servers)."
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3do8jb,Singasongsam,2,Fri Jul 17 22:58:07 2015 UTC,Hrmm I went from liberty to electrum wallet then made two transactions to different addresses within the wallet then sent both to market.  I guess it was a useless exercise.  Should I tumble it back to my wallet then back in again?

However, Tor use is perfectly legal and also encrypted, so your ISP can't see what you do on it, so some say VPN isn't necessary.  Best do your research and decide for yourself.  If you're just buying a couple grams here and there, most would say you wouldn't need to worry about a VPN."

Hit ""forbid scripts globally.""  Then click on the NoScript icon and go to its options.  Go to the Embeddings tab, and make sure all the checkboxes in the top half of the window are checked.  Any DNM you use will work just fine without scripts.  If they don't, you should use them.  Some other sites, like reddit, just aren't usable without scripts.  If you have to use them, I'd suggest learning how to use Tails, which is an entirely different operating system that you can install and boot from a thumb drive.  That way, sites still can't fuck with you too badly even with javascript on."

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3dobo9,MightBeMorganFreeman,2,Fri Jul 17 22:21:05 2015 UTC,"Swallowing an SD card sounds simpler & easier than it may be. Square-ish, flat, it'll stick to the side of your throat and make you gag. Unless you have some KY, petroleum jelly, olive oil, w/e near by, and you remember to dip it in blah blah blah. Maybe a mini-sd but most machines require it to be inserted via a larger adaptor casing to fit the slot.   With a USB you could jam it right up your pooper like R2D2 inserting C3PO's hemodroid suppository medication. But I suppose you could w/ an SD card too... Either way, you better be quick and prepared."

I think it's all preference but I think a lot more BIOS may be more friendly to usbs.  But, memory is memory and as long as it boots and you can configure it correctly you should be good.  I don't have much experiences with using SDs, so FAIK...    As far as RAM, you can read this.  Tails tries to give some protection against it.  It just says that on shutdown it will write some info to RAM so that it deletes anything that might be on it.    Also, remember to use good encryption and a lengthy password.  This way if they do by chance see you swallow what may be an SD card and force you to drink Epicac they'll still have to figure out the password.  Unless, they use a $5 wrench, insert comic here....

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3dmafv,DNMTN,2,Fri Jul 17 12:41:05 2015 UTC,"How important is it to disable JavaScript   Very. When the FBI takes over a Tor hidden onion site, they will often install malware that can de-anonymize the users of the site.  One vector for injecting malware into a users system is via an unpatched JavaScript exploit.     avoid Java in general?   Java and JavaScript are completely different things. The Tor browser does not include a Java plugin (and you should never install one), so you do not have to worry about getting hit by a Java exploit."

JavaScript is one of the main ways of client identification, and can be used in honeypots to identify the users of specific sites. Just make sure you use NoScript (which should have an icon in the top left), and only use HTTPS for clearnet sites with logins that may identify you (to avoid possibility of bad tor exit nodes)"

Also, usernames don't really matter as a buyer, but you are leaving a paper trail that is easy enough to follow by using the same username, you should use different usernames across each market/website so there is nothing identifying to link them together."

There are tonnes of perfectly legitimate reasons for using Tor away from the markets, such as journalists who use it for their safety within countries that don't allow for free speech etc. Your ISP can't see what you're doing within Tor so you'll be fine without it.

The 1.4.1 version of Tails is running Tor Browser version 4.5.3:  https://tails.boum.org/news/version_1.4.1/index.en.html  You will need to contact the admin of the forum and tell them that their version detection system has a bug.

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3dkwps,ziz1,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:48:38 2015 UTC,Yeah it's showing UTC but 30 minutes ago it wasn't. It was about an hour fast. I'm trying to post a pic of the screen also as there used to be a yellow onion in the top right corner next to the virtual pad but it's gone now. I don't get it.   How do I attach a picture to show you?
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3dkwps,ziz1,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:01:00 2015 UTC,"Tails tries to automatically adjust the clock to UTC after bootup. It seems to fail sometimes. If you are having consistent problems with it, you might try going into the BIOS setup screen during bootup and setting the system clock to UTC. Of course, this will make your Windows OS have the incorrect time.  Are you able to connect to the Tor network?   How do I attach a picture to show you?    You can post it to https://imgur.com and reply back with the link."
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3dkwps,ziz1,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:10:25 2015 UTC,I don't want to change my whole computers clock. I can get online through Tor and it shows my IP address as a random one too.

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3djqjr,YounginLam,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:32:26 2015 UTC,I only checked one vendor because most of them had a range of £100 - £1000 and I only want to buy £20 worth. Guess it was just that vendor then. Do you mean you were able to just create an account and buy coins immediately? thanks for reply
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3djqjr,YounginLam,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:57:43 2015 UTC,yes i have seen some vendors require this. i just chose others that dont that have good feed back. and yes i have been able to buy coins immediately. look for the vendors that do cash deposite. they will have the instructions on how to do this when you are ready to do the trade. when this is done the coins are instantly released into your wallet on LBC. then just send from LBC to your electrum wallet. then to your DNM wallet.

When i select the option of cash deposit purchase I get given a 'Reference Message' which is a code to identify the payment to myself, so the Seller knows who di it. How do i use this code? Do i send it in a message to the seller after I've deposited the cash? I dont see how that changes anything as far as identification goes because the Seller can already see my 'reference message'.

And once you install you have to keep it in the persistent folders or it will be deleted.  Pretty much I keep all my files I need in Persistent or it will be deleted.  Depending on your selection during Configure Persistent Volume.  Once you shutdown or remove the USB everything will revert back unless protected in the Persistent volume configuration or in the Persistent/Tor Browser(persistent)  Again I am new as well but this is just what I have learned so far.

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3dcjgr,_opsec_,2,Wed Jul 15 06:25:41 2015 UTC,Do you have a specific question?  Technical writing is an art.  You have to cover the relevant information without going into too much or too little detail.  It's hard to get that perfectly with these types of guides as many who can't figure out Tor will have a hard time anonymously delivering feedback.    What's enough information about encryption? What's enough information about Bitcoin?  Leave out too many details and you may do something unsafe because you don't know the risks.  Put in too many details and you may do something unsafe because you couldn't understand it all.

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3dcjgr,OneRedSent,2,Wed Jul 15 23:59:07 2015 UTC,I want to clarify myself a bit here. I think it is very hard for an expert at something to put themselves in the place of someone who has very little knowledge of their field. The ability to do this is what separates good teachers from bad teachers. I think that many of the guides I've encountered on this subreddit are not tailored towards individuals with little to no experience. One of the top posts ever asks to ELI5 using dark net markets and I believe it is still incredibly confusing to someone who is new to this. It's unrealistic to ask all guides to perfectly explain each step. But some of them (not all) could do a better job of explaining things to people who have no idea how to use this stuff. Just trying to help this place work more efficiently! Thanks for listening!
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3dcjgr,cluelesscitrus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:39:33 2015 UTC,"I feel you.  However, it's a bit unrealistic to expect these guides to have all the info. I've recently seen someone on here saying that they're having hard time, because they are don't really know what concepts like persistence mean.  It's completely ok to be at that place. The whole exciting and deep world of computers is out there for you to discover and learn. But you'll have to learn. And many of these concepts have wayyy better dedicated introductions and explanations than we can feasibly expect to be produced here.  Besides, would you even want to have it all in small steps with pictures? If you've gone as far as installing TAILS, you'll notice it asks you to check if the image is authentic and then you even have to install it to a temporary device and install it again from there to something else. All just to make sure nothing has been tampered with.  This is what we're dealing with here. DNMs are illegal. And your safety is paramount. If you really want to be sure that you're safe, you'll have to acquire the necessary knowledge. You shouldn't risk following some outdated guide that some anonymous person wrote, just because the task of figuring it all out seems too difficult.  Sorry, if I'm being a party pooper. I'm sure people on here will help as much as they can. People on the respective subreddits of tor and bitcoins will do as well. But I see no other way of being proactive, and putting in some work."

You can use your card to purchase of course, this does create a link to your identity however - but tumbling through a service such as Grams or BitBlender should be enough to clear that link and you will be fine from there. Don't rush into this if you aren't 100% sure of what you are doing, it can be disastrous if you make large rookie mistakes.  Let me know if you need any guidance whatsoever, always happy to help."

You will gain lots of confidence wth just a little thinking:  Read this sentence twice:  The blockcchain says nothing about what you purchased nor about who you purchased it from.  All it shows are amounts, random account numbers and times of transfers.  You send your money to a seller of human heads, all the blockcchain shows is a transfer to some account number that was spontaneously created.  The most that can be determined with tons of investigation is that the guy you sent money to happens to sell human heads on the side, but you may have simply bought a few dozen hamburgers from him."

Do i need to do it.   No.     And ive gotten tails downloaded but im stuck with the verifying the iso.   An easy way to verify the integrity of the Tails ISO on Windows is to install the HashTab utility.  It will calculate various file hashes by selecting a file in windows explorer, right clicking on it and selecting Properties -> ""File Hashes"".  You can download HashTab from here:  http://www.majorgeeks.com/mg/getmirror/hashtab,1.html  Once the file is downloaded, right click on it and select ""Extract All"".  Hit Extract.  Double click on ""HashTab v5.x.x.x Setup"" to install it.  Run through the default installer steps.  Once it is installed, right click on the Tails ISO in the file manager and select Properties.  Click on the File Hashes tab.  Click on the blue ""Settings"" below the hash values.  Check mark ""SHA-256"".  Check mark ""Use lowercase hash values"".  Hit OK.  The SHA256 hash value should now appear at the bottom of the Hash Value screen (after a small calculation delay).  (You will need to hover your mouse over the SHA-256 line to see the complete value.)  You can right click on the SHA256 value and select Copy to copy it into the clipboard.  The latest SHA256 hash for the ISO can be found here:  https://tails.boum.org/inc/stable_i386_hash/  Also here:  https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html (Do a Ctrl-F to search for ""sha256"")  An easy way to compare the hash value from the website to the one from HashTab is to copy them into a notepad window one below the other.  If the SHA256 hashes match, the ISO file verifies as good and you are ready to install it."

I just made a mistake and did not notice it.   There is nothing to be embarrassed about in my opinion, as the Tails OS's PGP system is very very very different from the other programs I have used, namely gpg4usb. I feel tails is much more difficult to understand, however, I have had a good teacher in Ziz1 and I'm slowly but surely figuring it out. I just learned how to export my private keys to my clipboard after about a day of frustration. So I would not be too embarrassed.   I have not decrypted a message yet with Tails, that is what I will try next. I'm pretty rapidly learning KeePassX as well, which is making life much much easier, despite the obvious risks. I noticed that keepass rates my master password at 200bit and my reddit username password at 260bit. Perhaps once I figure everything out, I should consider this my ""burner"" persistent volume. That way I can better lock things down in the future when I know what I'm doing."
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3dbt3j,ThisCouldVeryWellSuc,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:49:19 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to drop an update. My Tails knowledge, in heavy part thanks to your knowledge and resource links, have gotten me on the right track. I'm doing well with KeePassX, which is very important because of all the passwords that I need stored that would be impossible to remember otherwise, and is much safer than writing them in plain text. My PGP stills are coming along well thanks to the link you provided, which gave more detail than their actual website.   I still might consider making a new persisent volume before putting too much work into this one. The reason being I am not sure my password is strong enough. It's 23 characters of upper and lower case, numbers, and special characters (symbols and such.) According to KeePassX it offers between 180-200bit. While my reddit password for this account is 260bit. Seems like maybe I should make it stronger, what do you think? I will say this, it is totally random, it makes no sense at all, so maybe its enough, but I would value your input as always.   PGP is almost there. I can import keys and decrypt messages. However, I have not sent an encrypted message yet, nor have I created a new public key. Mainly because I have no need for it yet. Also, I have exported my public key, so I have a good grip, its coming along, and I owe you sir.   I'm sure I will have a few more questions. One thing now is about cloning the persistent volume with the program you listed. What was the link to that again? And when cloned, can I work onla that cloned volume in persistence, just as I do on my normal volume now, or does it clone to a read only?  Final note, I created two more USB backups of the latest version, like you suggested. And I was wondering, I'm not able to get into my windows hard drive at all, because I do not have the admin password it asks for, I forgot to create one when I did the persistence volume. I was able to get into it before on my non persistent volume, to locate the files you talked about that I needed to mount onto my Tails PGP to import them. Did I mess that up? Because it does not appear I would ever be able to access my windows HDD if I needed to mount something. But I guess it really does not matter as I can always do it from an second USB. It's actually easier, but was just wondering.  Thanks for everything, sorry for the long message, just get back to me whenever you can.   Oh and OP, I hope you find some of this info helpful as well, this man @ziz1 has a lot of knowledge, and now that I figured out some stuff, I would be happy to practice PGPing on Tails with you.   Cheers."

I just wonder how much of a market you will have.   You could be LE distributing a tainted version.  I could verify it myself, but if I know enough to do that then I could figure out how to download it myself.  And if I don't know how to verify it I probably shouldn't be running it.

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3d7l4h,bunnydoctor,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:48:44 2015 UTC,"Yep, and that's one of my concerns as well.  Trust would be a big issue.

If you trust that sort of thing....   My second option that I was thinking would be to setup a chat and dedicate an hour or so with people to walk them through it step by step.

You may be ok with that, but I suspect you probably aren't.   FWIW, I am 99.99% sure you aren't LE.  I can't imagine they would bother with sending out a tainted version of TAILS.  I am in the minority here, but I don't think TAILS adds a whole lot of incremental value to the majority of users.  I can't recall any stories where it actually helped someone.  It would have helped Ross, but it seems like it is kind of overkill for personal buyers.  Maybe it provides an additional .1% security of something.    I think it comes down to the fact that computer-geeky people will figure it out for themselves just for the fun of it.  And the other people aren't going to want to mess with it even if you hand the USB key to them and tutor them over Skype.  But from an entrepreneur perspective you shouldn't listen to me because I am not a potential client.  You should ask novices here and see if they are interested.  Good luck!"

But if you are just a regular guy it shouldn't matter.  Your opsec account can be tied to your real name for the purpose of helping people with TAILS and nothing else.    By the way, one of the problems I had with TAILS is that my laptop is super high resolution - 3200x1800.  When I booted everything was so small that I couldn't read anything or even see where to click.  Do you know if there is an easy way to change that setting and have it persist?"

Theoretically it can be done in simple cases, and LE will occasionally do it for something really important.  But all the people here going through elaborate tumbling schemes so they can ""safely"" order 7g of weed is kind of ridiculous.  LE is not going to invest the money required to build a custom tainted version of TAILS which can be instantly detected as tainted via verification of a PGP signature.  Plus the negative publicity if it is traced back to a certain agency because they would end up ""catching"" people who aren't doing anything illegal.    Even if they did, they would only catch small fish because anyone serious about security is going to only get it from a trusted source.  Personally, I would way more worried about some undiscovered exploit embedded in an open-source project part of TAILS than I would LE distributing a tainted version for sale on a USB drive.

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3d767q,DuhGretGezbee,2,Tue Jul 14 01:28:19 2015 UTC,"I guess it depends on how long you plan on keeping your coins in it. Most people I know that use Tails, and store their coins there for awhile use Electrum like you mentioned. For me, I never store my coins for more than an hour or two, before they are moved into the market wallet and then promptly spent. For this reason, I just use what I call a ""burner wallet,"" and I created it through Tor using blockchain.info's .onion site (you are automatically directed there if they detect you are using Tor. I have my coins sent there from the place I buy them from, and from there transfer them to their final resting place. They never stay in this wallet for more than an hour and there is no additional info I give the site. I have never considered using a wallet with the clearnet so I have no idea there.  Therefore, I think the wallet choice depends on length of storage and future plans. Electrum if they are going to be stored for a bit and blockchain through Tor if they are just going to be briefly held."
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3d767q,ThisCouldVeryWellSuc,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:46:59 2015 UTC,Could it raise suspicion from the service you buy your bitcoins from if you move it to a wallet created through TOR?
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3d767q,ThisCouldVeryWellSuc,2,Tue Jul 14 03:59:57 2015 UTC,"Also, one other thing to consider is that blockchain has both clearnet and Tor sites, and is probably used more by clearnet users, therefore I can not see it raising any suspicion unless you are getting your coins from a monitored site like CoinBase, Circle, etc."
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3d767q,_opsec_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:55:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think it would.  How would they know that wallet is yours?  What if you are just donating to a cause?  There are tons of wallets made with TOR.    What I do:  Localbitcoins.com in cash (face to face), you have a wallet on LBC.  Then to Electrum on Tails then to anywhere else.  No credit cards, no bank accounts.  No connections to you."
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3d767q,ThisCouldVeryWellSuc,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:39:20 2015 UTC,"That is an excellent system. I have been using bitquick.co a lot recently. They function a lot like localbitcoins. They just give you a name and account #, you go to whatever bank, cash deposit, and then your coins are sent to whatever address you gave. The thing I like a little bit more about bitquick, is that there is less of a mark up than with local, however, they take a heavy 1.5% or 2 % cut, so that is a little messy. But all the p2p options I have ever seen on local are really heavily marked up, but for anonymity and safety you pay a price."

Plus, I do not think they would even realize you created the online wallet with Tor, unless they studied into it. They are just releasing the funds to an address of a bunch of numbers, they have no idea how the address was creating unless they are acting with the US gov't and compliance with the Treasury Act. But I assume you are buying your coins in case and not through a site that rapes you for personal info.  I never create a clearnet wallet. I did not even know you could use Electrum clearnet, that would be insane, being that its part of the Tails OS."

I never have my bitcoin vendor send them directly to my Dark Wallet, for reasons that you can research on your own if you do not want to take my word for it.   So my formual is buy anonymously, send to anonymous online wallet, send to dark wallet (obviously). You can do the same but just replace the online wallet with your Electrum wallet. The reason I do not use the Electrum wallet is that I do not want to send them to a program wallet when I am just using said wallet as a burner. The coins will be only in it for literally one half hour.   Also, you did not ask this, but the site I buy my coins from, bitquick, allows me to access it using Tor. They have never given me shit about it, and the email contact I give them is also created through Tor. This give me a high degree of anonymity and never has raised any issues with the vendors.   I am not familiar with the program you are running, but I would search around reddit a little about it and see what others think as well."
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3d767q,RedditNewb4,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:44:30 2015 UTC,Wow there are so many different ways to do this its mind boggling at first.  I am new so new i just bought some small coin to practice moving around so i guess bitquick is a good idea. I imagine they charge a hefty price for coins given they offer so much?
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3d767q,ThisCouldVeryWellSuc,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:32:06 2015 UTC,"They take 2% so yeah, its a bit harsh. And the market up can be much harder than the fixed rate, however, you can beat that usually by just watching closely for 1-48 hours and the striking at the right moment and sometimes actually buy at a dollar or two under value, which is rare, but I have done it. Usually I'm paying about 5 points higher, but I can live with that, its no big deal compared to other anonymous sites like localbitcoins, which is a great site, but a real sellers market.   But seriously, its easy man. You just get everything set up in advance. Set your .onion blockchain wallet and know the address when you place your bitquick order. Do your business in cash at the bank and follow their instructions, and then as soon as you get the confirm, you can move your coins from the chain to your market wallet. It's not bad at all. If you are moving a lot of coin I would consider tumbling, but not for a couple hundred dollars.   Good luck, if you need anymore advice I would be happy to offer it. I was in your shoes not that long ago and they helped me out here. Also, for emails, check out Sigaint. It's a new Tor based mail, free sign up, and they even rolled out there own bitcoin tumbler. If you want to get really tech, you can use tails to remove the metadata from the picture of your receipt you upload and send it from your anonymous email address. I definitely would not worry about tumbling then. Cheers."

Using it may     compromise your privacy. We strongly recommend replacing Windows with      either Linux or BSD.  The great thing about Tails is that it can go on a USB or DVD and be booted up as the OS for your computer.  I would not use Windows.  Just put Tails on a DVD/USB and go from there.
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3d7psq,_opsec_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:28:54 2015 UTC,Ok that's cool. It's just that I've already done stuff on Tor while using Windows. Is Tor not safe on Windows?
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3d7psq,keyboardcatdead,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:05:35 2015 UTC,"Tor isn't the weak point there, the OS is. All that we know is that Windows is cracked by PRISM, there is most likely a keylogger being sent directly to the NSA/FBI, and other security backdoors like that.   Tails is a good way to go, it's simple, it's on the sidebar. That's a good way to start out. Is it ideal? No, but for the average person who buys drugs on the darknet, given good OPSEC it should be fine. It depends on the level of intelligence interest you have/deserve.   Also, keep in mind that the exit node (often government)  from Tor can sniff what you do so make sure to use end to end encryption, .onion links, or I2P as often as possible"

How the coins are obtained doesn't matter generally because BTC are legal.    But MUH OPSEC   Every step of the process from buying BTC to end product is a process. Categorizing possible threats and mitigating them is known as Operational Risk Management. You have trade offs between security and convenience. The act of buying BTC should be as painless as possible.   In theory, if Law Enforcement has unlimited funding for a fiscal year, they could outsource all of the technical work to third parties to analyse every transaction on BlockChain. In reality, this will never happen, with the added fact that many in the community (Law Enforcement) are technically illiterate and specialize in community skills and upholding the spirit of the law rather than worry about cyber crime.   Because of this, we can trade off security for convenience due to the legal nature of BTC and lack of options for LE.   Anyone that says differently, is still a noob themselves and does not understand the meaning of OPSEC.    Please described to me a threat model in which I will lose more advantages from buying using my Bank Account than I gain from using cash to buy BTC.

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3d6rmh,ThisCouldVeryWellSuc,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:55:29 2015 UTC,"Hi, if I caught you before you did this I am glad. My answer is yes if the atm does not require you to put any personal info in. NEVER use a site that requires you to link a personal bank account unless you either have no other option, or just do not care about OPSEC or personal privacy/safety. And if you do buy everything in your name in one of the sites mentioned. Use a tumbling service before sending to your DW. Do not rely on the simple internal mixers DMs use, be safe. (Do not take my word for it, google US bank secrecy Act, and US department of treasury and the two sites you mentioned. You will see they both fully comply.)  I do not believe the noobs section allows me to give you examples of clean sites to use that take cash and ask no question, but I will list a couple and edit if it erases them.  -Bitquick.co (buy under $200 at a time, to avoid the possibility of a license scan)  -Localbitcoins (search for a vendor that offers a good price and does not give a shit about you using your real name, and of course takes straight cash)"
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3d6rmh,HornyHobbitt,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:56:32 2015 UTC,I just skimmed over bitquick and it seems quick and easy. How anonymous would you say it is?  **Do you still have to include your bank information?
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3d6rmh,ThisCouldVeryWellSuc,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:05:25 2015 UTC,"Very. Although I have been told that if you buy $200 or more they may ask for a scan of your Drivers License. However, you could technically use any license, and it is not proof that you actually bought the coin.  I have used them 4 times, got my bitcoin in 1 hour each time. I buy between $160-180. I just walk in the bank, cash deposit, no ID, no questions, photo or scan the receipt, upload, done. They have a minute and a half tutorial on there of how to do it.   Keep in mind, they do tax a fee, but it's worth it for anonymity. Saves on tumbling fees. Bitcoin is now becoming enemy number one by the US Dept of Treasury.   Edit: And one final thing, if you really take OPSEC seriously. They allow for scans of the receipt uploaded, so you do not need to use a phone to take the picture and can upload it as an attachment from your anonymous Tor email (if you use Tails you can even wipe the metadata from the picture or scan), so your physical IP never comes anywhere near the coins. So little to no need to tumble."
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3d6rmh,ThisCouldVeryWellSuc,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:10:26 2015 UTC,Is making the TOR e-mail necessary? I feel as though it would make the process seem suspicious.
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3d6rmh,ThisCouldVeryWellSuc,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:37:25 2015 UTC,"It is not necessary. However, I do not think it makes the process look shady. I do not think bitquick.co cares what your emails IP address is, it might look suspicious if you access the bitquick site using Tor, but I do not think email matters. However, the wallet you have your coins sent to should be an anonymous wallet created through Tor. You can do this with blockchain.info's onion address if you want to make a simple ""burner wallet."" Use that to have your coins sent too from bitquick and then from that wallet send them to your market wallet.  But to answer, no, the email does not have to be with Tor. Wallet should be with Tor.   I use Tails for the whole process, so by default I'm taken care of."

You are going to a bank to put cash into an account of someone you do not know or have any connection to what-so-ever. After that you just send them an upload of the receipt to prove to them that you paid the anonymous seller. After that you get your coins released into your hopefully anonymously created wallet.   You now have coins that were sent to you by some random person, in some random state, that have no ties to you at all.   I access the site using Tails. I have create a burner wallet through Tor on the blockchain, I upload the picture to them from the anonymous email I provided and even wipe the picture clean of metadata. This is almost certainly overkill, but fuck it, it only takes an extra minute, so why not.

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3d3n10,sapiophile,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:59:41 2015 UTC,"Tails bypasses Mac OS(X), or any other operating system, so that isn't a concern.  We will probably never really know about the hardware - those kinds of backdoors are above top secret, even beyond Snowden's clearance. But there's little reason to suspect that Apple products would have them while other major computer brands do not. However, because of how high-level the secrecy of any such backdoor would be, it is almost impossible for any LE to actually reveal those capabilities by prosecuting you with them. They would have to develop an expensive and extremely risky parallel construction, which takes a lot of effort and has a high likelihood of backfiring - so it's almost certainly not going to happen unless you're an extremely high-value target, like Al Qaeda. So, if all you're trying to do is buy some drugs, for all intents and purposes, they can be ignored."

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3d2tyx,sapiophile,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:45:04 2015 UTC,"I strongly disagree. The entire foundation of OPSEC is thorough separation of activities and identities. Keeping your DNM activities isolated on a dedicated computer, and not using it for other things, is greatly preferable to what you're suggesting.  A computer whose files haven't been touched in a long time is very easy to explain if it's a backup computer, or it's had some issues that you never got around to fixing, or it was sitting in a friend's closet forever and they just gave it to you, etc. etc. etc. Deniability is easy, and on top of that, it's a distantly secondary concern to proper separation of identities and activities.  Mixing your DNM activities or hardware with your normal, identifiable activities or hardware simply makes it easier for an adversary to draw links between them - for example, should the user's Tails instance get compromised, it could then look through the contents of the installed hard drive to find out their real identity or habits. Or the inverse - should the non-anonymous system get compromised, it could then infect a writeable Tails device that gets inserted into it with some kind of malware. Other potential problems with that kind of mixing are legion.  While it isn't necessary by any stretch, if a user is already able/prepared to use an isolated computer for their DNM activities, discouraging them is not a good idea."

I believe if you read through his comments, he suggests using as few devices as possible in order to be able to erase your tracks as quick as possible. Plus your aim is to be anonymous. If you are doing innocent activity on it in your name, you erase your anonymity.   Wipe the OS right away. Do not register the machine at all. Just learn Tails, boot it always. You never even have to visit the original OS if you don't want too. And if you ever feel threatened, throw it in a fire. But with Tails, you should never have to worry about that, even if LE get's their hands on it. That's the purpose of that kind of OS."
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3d2tyx,ThisCouldVeryWellSuc,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:55:38 2015 UTC,Can I just have TAILS be the primary OS instead of booting it from a USB?
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3d2tyx,smokingdickhead,2,Mon Jul 13 05:40:06 2015 UTC,"To my knowledge you cannot completely replace an OS and have Tails boot from the computers HDD. Tails can either by used by DVD boot or by USB boot. I recommend USB, because it makes updating Tails very easy, and you can also store all your PGP keys on there with is a must for your activities. You want all communication to be encrypted.  So from what you are asking for, I would just by a new and cheap machine, but by a name brand, Toshiba, HP, Sony, they all have laptops for under $200, but the specs are very dated, but for your uses that is not relevant. When you by the new machine, the first time you boot it, you can access your bios menu, and boot with Tails. You do not ever have to register or access the system OS, and in a way the machine will stay ""air gaped.""   That said, for me personally I would probably boot a couple times with the default OS. Because you might need to make some changes, especially if you are going to create a Tails persistent volume, you might need to mount some files (import all your PGP keys), read @sapiophile's comments on this for more info.   Looking back, I really wish I had done what you are doing and exactly plan on cleaning out my old computers and buying a new cheap one to do almost exactly what you are talking about. I will probably by one with, or install, the linux OS.   Hope this helps, give amazon a look. I saw a couple PCs on there last night, one a Toshiba satellite for around $115. It had bad specs and very little HDD space, but like I said, that is not relevant for your needs. You are thinking good OPSEC in my opinion.   Good luck and let us know what machine you decide on and how it works for you."

Any input would be appreciated.   It would be best to verify the Tails ISO file on Windows before you boot your computer from it.  You can still verify the original ISO file on your Windows system and then know that your current Tails boot device is safe.  An easy way to verify the integrity of the Tails ISO on Windows is to install the HashTab utility.  It will calculate various file hashes by selecting a file in windows explorer, right clicking on it and selecting Properties -> ""File Hashes"".  You can download HashTab from here:  http://www.majorgeeks.com/mg/getmirror/hashtab,1.html  Once the file is downloaded, right click on it and select ""Extract All"".  Hit Extract.  Double click on ""HashTab v5.x.x.x Setup"" to install it.  Run through the default installer steps.  Once it is installed, right click on the Tails ISO in the file manager and select Properties.  Click on the File Hashes tab.  Click on the blue ""Settings"" below the hash values.  Check mark ""SHA-256"".  Check mark ""Use lowercase hash values"".  Hit OK.  The SHA256 hash value should now appear at the bottom of the Hash Value screen (after a small calculation delay).  (You will need to hover your mouse over the SHA-256 line to see the complete value.)  You can right click on the SHA256 value and select Copy to copy it into the clipboard.  The latest SHA256 hash for the ISO can be found here:  https://tails.boum.org/inc/stable_i386_hash/  Also here:  https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html (Do a Ctrl-F to search for ""sha256"")  An easy way to compare the hash value from the website to the one from HashTab is to copy them into a notepad window one below the other.  If the SHA256 hashes match, the ISO file verifies as good and you are ready to install it."

It would seem to be fairly important for vendors. Less so for small buyers. You probably should at least send them to an intermediate wallet to give yourself plausible deniability.  Coin buying service wallet > Electrum wallet on Tails > Darknet market.  With that path, you could have sold the coins to somebody on the street for cash, and they were the ones that sent it to the darknet market.  Don't forget about increasing the fee you pay to transfer your coins on the blockchain. There was / might still be a spam attack going on against the bitcoin network using the standard fee. If you don't use a higher fee, your bitcoin transaction won't get verified for a long time.  Check /r/bitcoin for up to date info on the problem."

It might just be using your network card's MAC address for ""authentication,"" in which case as long as you DISABLE ""MAC Spoofing"" in the Tails start-up screen, you should be able to connect normally. If, however, the network administrator went the more secure route, and actually is using some kind of windows domain- or active directory-based authentication, then it may not really be feasible (it's likely possible, but it's complicated, and you'll also need to set up persistence in Tails to store your credentials).  I don't know who your network's admin is, but unless they're pretty cool, they might be a little suspicious as to why you need their help setting up access for Tails.   Is it safe to connect on tails to the wireless network form my phone hotspot?    Yes, although it's not ideal, since your phone is probably closely tied to your real identity. But it's not going to immediately de-anonymize you through Tor or anything."

Click on the File Hashes tab.  Click on the blue ""Settings"" below the hash values.  Check mark ""SHA-256"".  Check mark ""Use lowercase hash values"".  Hit OK.  The SHA256 hash value should now appear at the bottom of the Hash Value screen (after a small calculation delay).  (You will need to hover your mouse over the SHA-256 line to see the complete value.)  You can right click on the SHA256 value and select Copy to copy it into the clipboard.

It's different for different makes and models of computer, but usually there's a certain key that you press right after you power the computer on that will activate the BIOS menu and/or a Boot Selection menu (which is different from your bootloader menu that you're seeing). You might have to press the key repeatedly, once or twice per second, for the first 10 or 20 seconds after powering on the computer. On many Dell computers, for instance, these keys are usually F2 and F12, respectively, but on some there might be only one and it might be Esc, Del, F6, or almost any other. You can do a web search for [your computer's model] AND BIOS AND key and see if that turns it up, or [your computer's model AND ""boot selection"" OR ""boot device"" AND key to find out about a potential boot selection menu.  If you end up in the BIOS menu, what you're looking for is usually called ""Boot Order"" or ""Boot Priority"" - you'll want to put ""CD/DVD/Optical Drive"" (or similar) and ""Removable USB Device"" (or similar) above ""Internal Hard Disk/HDD"" (or similar), then reboot with your Tails medium inserted."

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3clola,3lixr,3,Wed Jul 8 22:08:10 2015 UTC,"I'd store elsewhere than LBC, electrum, multibit, etc. You really don't need to take any precautions, tumbling just makes it safer, because ur ID is connected to the transaction that bought the coins. Simple block chain check can trace it back. Choose a market, send coins (Preferably on Tails.) Encrypt ur shipping info via PGP. Thats the basics"

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3clfda,Athiesm,15,Wed Jul 8 20:41:07 2015 UTC,"No, you could comfortably buy BTC, send to DarkNetMarket wallet and buy a product. You need to threat model your convenience versus security. How much convenience do you want versus how much security do you want as a trade off?  Each factor, from buying BTC to Sending it, to buying items is a step in a threat model that exponentially increases your risk of being caught. You need to mitigate these buy using tools of the trade or OPSEC. Your end product that you receive will also be part of this.   LSD. Low end of the spectrum.  Heroin. Higher end of the spectrum.  However, the problem with Windows or MAC is that it is a common OS which makes it an easier target of various parties, be them LE or other. Also the settings for traffic/application information security aren't set in mind for not leaking information.  Each step of the process can be labelled and mitigated. It's up to you how much are you willing to invest to prevent any mishaps.   ASSUME EVERY ITEM WILL BE CAUGHT AND YOU NEED TO LEARN HOW TO PREVENT IT LINKING TO YOU"

If you're vending and sending out multiple packages a day all the time with hand written shipping address/return address LE can definitely start to profile packages with that certain hand writing. Way back in the day vendors would usually always write out shipping address, and now it's a stupid thing to do cause it's almost like a finger print which could be quite easy to start profiling cause vendors may be shipping from different PO boxes but they are still in the same general vicinity.

And how exactly do I start my computer in BIOS and then force it to start from the USB drive with tails on it?   That depends on what BIOS the manufacturer installed on the computer.  For some systems you hit the Del key to get into the BIOS setup.  For Dells, you hit F2 for setup and F12  for a boot menu.  For HPs, you hit Esc for setup and F9 for a boot menu.  You want to change the device boot order so that the machine will attempt to boot from a USB device before it boots from the internal hard drive.  If you have an option called ""Secure Boot"", that needs to be disabled.

Someone with a good trojan/botnet could just keep throwing these accounts at you as long as they're interested.  I would realistically expect them to work for 6 months-2 years if the vendor has a good reputation.  Amazon refunds just involve telling Amazon your package didn't show up.  They expect that to happen with some frequency and it is usually cheaper to refund you than to investigate or challenge it if it's your first time claiming that.

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3c7n9m,ziz1,3,Sun Jul 5 18:25:35 2015 UTC,"But is it safe to transfer from Windows wallet to Tails wallet or can this transfer be traced?   Well, the transfer will be seen in the blockchain. Because you are probably connecting to the Electrum network directly on Windows, your home IP address might be linked to those bitcoin addresses. Your Tails Electrum wallet has its packets routed over the Tor network, so those bitcoin addresses are not linked to your home IP address. After the transfer, you have plausible deniability that you no longer control the coins. You could have sold them to somebody for cash and they are the ones in control of the bitcoin address that you sent your coins to from Windows."

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3c40zf,reking,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:34:16 2015 UTC,"To do that, you'll have to encrypt your GPG data in some kind of container. I would recommend using TrueCrypt 7.1a for that. Your GPG data is usually in ~/.gnupg on GNU/Linux, possibly the same on Mac, and I have no idea on Windows but I would guess somewhere in your ""Application Data"" or ""Local Settings"" directories. It will be hidden, in any case, so make sure your file manager is set to show hidden files.  Then you can just make a small truecrypt container and move that whole gnupg directory into it, and then mount it when you need to use GPA. You'll have to go into GPA's preferences to tell it where it can find its keyring data.  Or, you could just use Tails with persistence like you should be doing anyway, and you'll be much more secure and private with much less work."

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3c2ujt,neovngr,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:20:14 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind the principle that there is literally never any such thing as ""perfect"" security. Even if you're using a Yeeloong MIPS netbook with fully open-source BIOS, firmware and operating system, it's possible that one of the simple timer ICs on the motherboard has a backdoor to bootstrap some kind of advanced persistent malware tool into the OS.  So, there will always be ""some"" risk. However, removing the hard drive and booting a verified Tails medium is a great way to close a lot of potential routes for problems. I would say you'd be good, at that point - although I'm not sure how well a Chromebook can handle actually booting alternative operating systems. In my own paranoid mind, Google kinda creeps me the hell out and I would opt to stay far away from their hardware - there are plenty of other cheap netbooks around that are made by companies in jurisdictions a little less friendly with the U.S. government. And I would also recommend getting something second-hand, anyway, which brings down the price a lot - Linux (which is the kernel used by Tails) support for the newest hardware isn't great, and you don't need a powerhouse to use the DNMs.  The other thing to keep in mind, though, is that exploits on the kind of level that you're talking about are going to be very high-level, and very valuable to whoever is doing that spying. That means that they will not want to reveal them, so to use them would require some damn good parallel construction to explain the bust. Doing that would be incredibly expensive for them, and I would say that unless you're distributing CP, lots of guns or munitions, or jihadist propaganda, they're not something you should really worry about."

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3buzo3,EnduranceShip,8,Thu Jul 2 11:02:52 2015 UTC,Tails is recommended to protect you in the worst case scenario where you've already been arrested.  If they suspect DNMs then LE may use your machine to prove that you intentionally broke the law. The USB Tails thing is a physical barrier - and it's a measure taken to encourage everybody to remove that evidence from your every day machine.  The reason you can't be bothered with this security layer is that you think it will be difficult to do. Why not just try it instead of asking if it's alright to ignore the recommendation?  The risk of being arrested in the first place is low for buyers. You will still need to use PGP and encrypt your delivery address manually - i.e. on your desktop and not through an automated market-side server script.
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3buzo3,bunnydoctor,5,Thu Jul 2 12:51:52 2015 UTC,"You would definitely need it for 6g of weed, but for 5g you are fine.  :-)  Seriously, if you ever get in a situation where TAILS saves your ass, so many things have gone south that you are in a world of hurt.  You have to understand that most Reddit users like to fuck with computer stuff because it is fun (I am in that camp too).  TAILS is interesting because you know absolutely that there is no evidence left on your computer.  There are occasional stories on /r/DarkNetMarkets about people getting arrested, and it is almost always people who are selling and someone rats them out.  However, I have never seen a story where local LE did any kind of actual forensic work on a computer such that TAILS would have helped them.  If you are running a market or your are a dealer, 100% you should run TAILS.  If LE gets involved because they find your 5g of weed, they aren't going to be trying to prove your bought it from the darknet."
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3buzo3,sapiophile,2,Fri Jul 3 00:26:23 2015 UTC,"In my mind, forensics are at the bottom of the list of really good reasons to use Tails. Much more important is that it is a more secure platform in general that will help defend against drive-by malware attacks, which are the only confirmed method that LE have used to de-anonymize Tor users.  Also, most Windows users in what I might generalize to say ""the DNM demographic"" probably have spyware, TeamViewer, or other serious security issues present on their main OS, which can make it trivial for LE to de-anonymize them by a different route.  Using Tails addresses all of these concerns, and that's the reason that I recommend it so heavily."
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3buzo3,bunnydoctor,2,Fri Jul 3 18:38:54 2015 UTC,How would spyware or something like TeamViewer de-anonymize you on their own?  Wouldn't the police have to be actively watching you in order to use some of those tools?  And wouldn't that be hacking by the police?
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3buzo3,sapiophile,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:53:19 2015 UTC,"Security holes are unpredictable. There's no way to know what a particular piece of malware is doing to the rest of your system, and it may even modify other programs like Tor Browser in a way that breaks its anonymity. For instance, it might detect that Tor Browser is a web browser, which spyware wants to spy on in order to see what sites it is visiting (so that this data can be sold to advertisers), so it may install a proprietary Add-On to Tor Browser that sends a copy of every URL you visit to a marketing company's servers - probably over an un-encrypted connection.  For other issues like hacking, yes, the threat model is different, but it is still not really a good idea. Going from ""let's try to identify who this user on this DNM site is"" to ""let's see if any of these millions of wide-open, insecure computers are the DNM user we're trying to track"" is not a very big leap. But yes, the risk is probably not as great as, say, using an out-of-date Tor Browser or something like that."

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3bu5vu,ybwennayr1,3,Thu Jul 2 04:27:42 2015 UTC,"PGP is a lockbox  Your public key allows you to lock the lockbox.  Your private key needs the public key to unlock the lockbox.  To decrypt messages, you need (Private Key + Public Key + Passphrase)  Your giant PGP text you see, is your passphrase + private key + public key + expiration date + and other small data. They all combine to make a unique text that is unique to you only. If you lose your PRIVATE key. You can not decrypt messages. However,  as long as you are not a vendor. You probably wont have to decrypt messages.  Take your GIANT TEXT of PGP (Public key) and post it to your profile. This is so others can see it and use it, if need be.    When you are ready to order, copy the VENDOR PGP key and combine that with your message. This will create a UNIQUE PGP text that only he can read.

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3bu5vu,sapiophile,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:39:22 2015 UTC,"While this explanation works, it has a lot of things wrong with it that I'd like to correct, in the interest of everybody gaining a better understanding of these technologies.   PGP is a lockbox    Your public key allows you to lock the lockbox.   So far, so good. Using someone else's Public Key, you can then encrypt a message or data to that Public Key and they will only be able to decrypt it with the Private Key, which nobody else should have.   To decrypt messages, you need (Private Key + Public Key + Passphrase)   Almost, but not quite. All that's needed is the Public Key and the un-encrypted Private Key. The confusion is because the Private key is kept (symmetrically) encrypted on disk, and the passphrase produces the key that is used to decrypt it. Once the Private Key has been decrypted by the passphrase, it is kept in memory (RAM) and used to decrypt the message itself. The file that stores your Private Keys (secring.gpg, usually) is not actually the keys themselves, but rather encrypted data that contains those keys and some other metadata about them.   Take your GIANT TEXT of PGP (Public key) and post it to your profile. This is so others can see it and use it, if need be.   I feel like this is really unclear, so I just want to explain what is meant. The goal here is to put your OpenPGP (GPG) Public Key in your user profile so that others can send you encrypted messages and data. To do this, you need to Export your own Public Key in ""ASCII armored"" format (that's the format you will find most keys displayed as, with letters, numbers and symbols instead of machine-code data that cannot be read or copy+pasted). Depending on what GPG software you're using, Exporting your Public Key could present it in a lot of ways, but you basically want it to end up copied to your system's clipboard. You might have to Export it to a text file or something, first. Once you've copied your Exported, ASCII Armored Public Key to your clipboard, you can then Paste it into your user profile and save it there for others to use.   When you are ready to order, copy the VENDOR PGP key and combine that with your message. This will create a UNIQUE PGP text that only he can read.   This piece of ""advice"" is actually downright dangerous, in my opinion. You don't want to ""combine"" the vendor's Public Key ""with your message"" - you want to Import the vendor's Public Key into your OpenPGP (GPG) software first, and then use that software to Encrypt your message to them, again in ASCII Armored format (which will probably be the default format, so don't worry too much). You then copy the Encrypted, ASCII Armored message that begins with ----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE---- and ends with ----END PGP MESSAGE----, including those lines, and paste that into the box for the message you're sending to the vendor.  Finally, using DNMs on an Android or iOS device is a pretty stupid idea for a lot of different reasons. Also your guide's link has been removed by automod."

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3bu5vu,Mrtruthful,2,Thu Jul 2 06:29:03 2015 UTC,PGP encrypts your information so only the person you want to see it can. When a vendor generates a PGP key they have a public one that encrypts the message and then they use their private one to decrypt. This is recommended to use as if LE get ahold of a markets source code/database they will just have jumbled text and not your actual address.  If you don't encrypt your address then LE can see the plain text you sent and track you down.
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3bu5vu,sapiophile,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:52:58 2015 UTC,do you just paste the pgp key next to the information you're providing in the textbox?
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3bu5vu,Mrtruthful,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:17:47 2015 UTC,"No, you have to import the recipient's public key into your GPG software, and then use GPG to encrypt the message to that recipient. Then you can copy+paste the encrypted message in the textbox on the market site."

However, most if not all blunder are going to be from the USER element.   If you ever get busted what are the laws in the US on being forced to give up the password to this type of shit?   There is a docket case pertaining to this. The most popular is ""CODE vs KEY"", ruling that as long as the password is a product of the mind: It is covered under 5th amendment rights.  As long as you do not WRITE down the password on a piece of paper and you hold RESPONSIBILITY over it, you'll be fine. Because when it is physical, it is NOT covered under the 5th amendment.   Lastly, there is a thing called ""FORGONE CONCLUSION"". This pertains to information that is already known to be there.

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3bryqg,sapiophile,2,Fri Jul 3 19:30:33 2015 UTC,What's the point of randomly generating one password only to secure it with another password that I know? Seems like I could just be asked for my KeePass password and that would compromise the entire system
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3bryqg,sapiophile,2,Sat Jul 4 16:01:21 2015 UTC,"There are lots of very good reasons for doing this.  The #1 reason is that if you re-use passwords, then if one gets compromised, they all get compromised. And because your password manager passphrase never goes out over a network, and is secured by a more robust key derivation function than practically any website, it is significantly less likely to be compromised.  Websites (even DNMs) get hacked and get their password files dumped pretty often. It is nothing but foolish, in my opinion, to ever re-use passwords for different services/uses in this modern age.  Keeping more than a couple worthwhile passphrases that can actually be remembered is, for nearly everyone, impossible. This leads either to password re-use, poor-quality passwords, or both. Using a password manager addresses this very well.  With regard to securing your GPG keys with a passphrase from a password manager, GPG keys are a very high-value target, and are also normally backed up in multiple places. There are elevated odds that your GPG keyring may end up in an adversary's hands while other data or credentials of yours do not. And even if they get it all, they may still be likely to try attacking your GPG passphrase as a priority, or with more expense than other potential authentication credentials. Therefore, it is extremely important to secure your GPG private keys with exceptionally strong passphrases, something that is only practical to do with a password manager.  Of course, you should consider your threat model and develop your credential security plan accordingly. If you think that it is significantly likely that your adversary may end up with a copy of your computer's (or your Tails drive's) un-encrypted data, then yes, a password manager may not be appropriate. Additionally, if you live in a jurisdiction that can force you to reveal passwords, like the U.K., then that might also be a reason not to use one. If, on the other hand, the primary risk to your authentication credentials is a remote dictionary attack, and/or the compromise of an online service (like a DNM - or even just your personal email), which it is for most people, then a password manager makes a lot of sense."

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3bm98h,Morfeo25,2,Tue Jun 30 11:49:38 2015 UTC,"Well, I'd spend a little more time identifying your biggest threat surface.  Tails and Whonix are both great, but one excels against a certain threat but only does 'ok' or very little on the other one.    Tails has an edge when it comes to 'physical' risk factors, such as your equipment being seized or stolen, since it has that amnesic setup.  But, it's not so great, or rather--no where near as great, at ensuring an enemy on the other ends of your wire do not discover you, your IP, whatever.  Whonix, with either stream or physical isolation excels in this arena, but we're talking two persistent VMs which could potentially leave evidence behind...thus not being the 'ideal' choice if you need to worry about the physical security-side of things.  VPNs -- Personally, I'll never touch one.  There're just far too many unknowns about who actually owns them, whether they 'don't' log or 'don't keep logs long' (like we have any way of 'truly' knowing...though any service-provider who claims they absolutely don't log at all has to be lying.  How the heck do you troubleshoot issues otherwise?).  Who owns them?  No way to know.  Tor-this/tor-that...but you're sticking a huge unknown risk factor right into the equation with VPNs and that doesn't work for me.  Maybe you're fine, maybe you're not, but in this game, unknown = same as bad.  Now, if you just like looking at drug-porn and the like...you can go ahead and stop where you are. In fact, you may have even put in too much time already.  This is a time/money/effort vs. security tradeoff and there's the law of diminishing returns to consider.  Nothing will ever be perfect, but you could easily spend every waking moment for rest of your life trying to achieve it.  Identify your threats and use the best tool for the job (then spend some time learning what it can/can't do...you should be doing that personally, and not relying on advice from social-media sites).

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3bnf0y,Realseppy,2,Tue Jun 30 16:52:28 2015 UTC,"An Electrum bitcoin wallet running on Windows isn't anonymous unless you run it through Tor.   Or do you just need a wallet on your normal OS ?   Best to just have an Electrum wallet on Tails.     Bitcoin wallet (like Electrum) located on permanent storage on Tails?   If you setup persistence and enable ""Bitcoin Client"" on Tails then your wallet will be saved in the encrypted persistence volume on your USB:  https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/persistence/configure/index.en.html  Unfortunately, it is far from ""permanent storage"". USB flash drives can be very unreliable. You need to write down your seed words and regenerate the wallet from those seed words to make sure that you wrote them down correctly. Too many people have lost all of the money in their wallets because they somehow wrote down their seed words incorrectly and didn't test them.    You should also make a backup image of your USB drive with persistent storage. A single bit error in the ""right"" place on the LUKS encrypted header will completely wipe out your encrypted storage.  If you are a Windows user, you can use this program to make a backup image of your entire Tails USB including persistence:  http://www.alexpage.de/usb-image-tool/download/  If your Tails USB fails or is lost at some point, you can use this tool to write the image back out to a 2nd USB of the exact same size or larger and be ready to go with a bootable Tails USB with all of your persistence data intact. Best to buy a few USB flash drives of the same model number so that you are more likely to get drives of the same size. You can test your backup system by backing up an image of your Tails USB and then writing it back out to a 2nd USB. Boot from the 2nd USB and make sure that all of your data has been saved."

If your wallet is located on tails, you still need a way to get bitcoins on it. I thought you do that through the clearnet via some site - and I can do that on my normal os, is that right?  Or should I try to purchase Bitcoins with using Tails somewhere on the darknet?"

Say you are logged into Localbitcoins on Windows, you would just send your bitcoins to one of the addresses in your Tails wallet.

Am I right in thinking that the only point in which I've committed a crime is placing the order and sending the money which I will do through Tor on TAILS?   The chances of your internet history being a problem is nill. Just wipe your history if you don't want a local copy of it. However, if they request (they wont) a copy of your history from the ISP, (no chance), then circumstance permitting consider it evidence. However, history showing how to make bombs isn't illegal the possession is.   FE   Entirely up to you. If the Vendor requires it, make a conscious decision weather you can afford to lose the money. If you do, consider that money gone and if you get drugs, than it's a good day.    Stealth   How a package is stealth is usually dependent on the vendor. Each have there own ways. Reputable are better (generally). You can contact them to ask for a specific way to stealth/pack it. However you will pay more for more time invested into your package.   Just leave them be. They've been doing this for longer than you have.   Different laptop   Your laptop you use doesn't matter. Because once the booted device is pulled out, all the information it produced is gone.

Lots of buyers use the persistence to save their PGP keys as well. You will need to save your own PGP key if you decide to enable two factor authentication on a marketplace.  You don't have to save your own key to persistence since most of the time, the flow of encrypted data is from the buyer to the vendor and not in the other direction. If you think you'll only need to encrypt your address to the vendors, then you can just import their key from the marketplace profile whenever you need to encrypt a message to them, instead of saving it to persistence.  If you do decide to create and use an encrypted persistence partition it is essential that you backup your data. USB flash drives can be very unreliable.

Windows is the most insecure operating system....If you ever actually need the actual security the encryption provides you're a fool to be using windows.  The best method is to keep your Key offline permentely.  If you have multiple computers its not so bad.... If you install Tails to a USB you can create a ""Persistent"" drive that you can set to save your personal files and GPG Keys. It has an email client ""Claws"" or you could use the OpenPGP Encryption Applet.

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3bi5ec,bonehoes,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:56:01 2015 UTC,"Your setup is fine.  The transfering from one electrum to another just adds more more address inbetween ""you"" and ""darknet market you"".  It allows you to claim you gave the money to somebody else with that address and they sent it to a market.  But there's still a path on the blockchain from Coinbase to the market for anybody who wants to follow it.  That's very very likely to be just fine though - nobody cares and again, you have that extra step where you can claim the coins left your control.  If you want to completely remove all links, you'd use a tumbler.  A tumbler basically has a big giant pool of coins - think of an exchange for example - and you send in your coins from say the clearnet Electrum, and they send you back completely different coins into your darknet Electrum.  That breaks the blockchain analysis link completely.  (Although the tumbling service still has that information.)  It's all about just how much security you need.  Your setup is probably fine.  OTOH if you were a modern day Escobar doing millions upon millions of dollars worth of business, then ya maybe use a tumbler."

It isn't like they can just ask Facebook for a list of people talking about the Darknet.  And unless you are some MAJOR dealer (I am assuming you aren't) they are never going to bother going to Facebook to find out about you.  Even if you got caught in a controlled delivery (very unlikely for personal amounts), I doubt they would bother trying to track you down on Facebook.  Go ahead and delete the messages, though.

I work in a field that partners with LE frequently, and they are always asking us to sit in on presentations from vendor after vendor for new software/apps/services aggregating social media sites/posts from around the area. In one of the demos, my boss's jaw actually dropped at the number of kids posting shots of their drug stashes or of themselves using. He mentioned something like ""holy shit. don't they realize we can see this?"" to which the vendor responded ""no, that's exactly what makes it so effective.""  Fast forwarded to a few months later, a few surrounding counties had gone with one of these vendors and one of them ended up using the product extensively in order to locate and intervene on a young lady who had apparently been planning to commit suicide. That county's LE thought this was a great success story about their wise investment in the costly service and as such, had all their people blast it to the local media.   Less than a week later, the state sent out this huge memo to all the local agencies that pretty much said, ""Shut the fuck up, it wont work if they fucking realize we're doing it."""

Check mark the Tails key.  Check mark ""I have verified the fingerprint"".  Hit Next.  Select which of your keys you want to sign it with.  Select ""Certify for myself"".  Hit ""Certify"".  Enter the passphrase for your key.  Hit Finish.  Right click on the Tails key again and select ""Change Owner Trust"".  Select ""I believe checks are very accurate"".    Hit File on the top menu bar and select ""Decrypt/Verify Files"".  Drill down to the directory where both the Tails ISO and the Tails ISO signature (.sig) files are located.  Select either one.

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3b8yvp,Delta9MethylTryptami,2,Sat Jun 27 02:23:40 2015 UTC,"When checking for bogus reviews, look for a similar style amongst the good reviews. For instance, one guy I saw used "". . ."" a lot in his fake reviews. Using ellipses a lot is uncommon, and using them incorrectly in that way is even less common. Huge red flag.  When you look at the reviews, keep in mind that most people are pretty gentle in their reviews because nobody wants to talk shit on an anonymous drug dealer who knows their name and address. 5/5 can mean anything from 2/5 to 5/5, honestly. Even if the product is a solid 1/5, people will still rate 5/5 out of fear. For this reason, the bad reviews are often more telling than the good ones - if you leave a bad review, it's normally because you received a pretty unacceptable product.  Long breaks are often signs of an unreliable vendor, but not necessarily one who has flipped.  When you check reviews, always search /r/darknetmarkets and the market forums and, just to be on the safe side, don't buy if you don't see consistently good reviews there. I know every vendor has to have a few first customers testing the waters before they can get big, but it's really not smart or safe to be one of those first customers in my opinion.  Disregard any ""5/5 fe will update"" reviews.  Also, avoid vendors who look like they have put very little effort into making their vendor page and product listings look professional. Avoid any vendor who displays any sign of laziness. The biggest risk in the buying process is always the shipping and you don't want your vendor getting lazy and doing a shitty job in their packaging.

That's crazy even for a first and last time buyer.   DNM noob section for some reason forbids me from giving you a list of good sites to use, but basically you want to use a site/method that allows you to buy them in cash, giving zero personal info. After that have them transferred to a wallet your created with Tor or something that masks your physical location. At that point, you can be pretty safe without even tumbling. Although, you are transferring such a small sum, that it's not going to bring attention to it.  Just search reddit for cash methods and you will find the right place to buy them. If you absolutely must use a site that rapes you for info however, then your plan is a pretty decent one in terms of OPSEC. But please reconsider using a site that links your personal bank."

It's so that if you send the same message in different circumstances someone can't just match it with one they happen to have figured out. So like say that you have a dealer that asks you every week if you want him to drop of some product. You say 'yes', encrypt it using PGP and I happen to see that message, and notice he came by. When you say 'yes' next week, I won't be able to tell that he's coming again because the encryption payload is completely different from the one I saw.  I'll see if I can't remember/figure out the procedure that lets this happen and edit it in.   Edit: It looks like PGP just generates a random key, encrypts the data with that key and then encrypts that key with your public key. That way the data is always different and your private key can decrypt the randomly generated key to decrypt the data."

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3b14dw,Freaky_Deeky,3,Thu Jun 25 03:09:09 2015 UTC,The program you're looking for is called Ubootin. It creates Bootable flash drives from .iso files. It's pretty strait forward and once you've booted into tails there should be an install option on the desktop if you want to install it onto your hard drive.     Edit: So apparently Tails doesn't like Ubootin. So load up the .iso into a Virtual machine and plug in your USB. Then go to the top left and click devices to bring your USB into the virtual machine. You should then be able to run Tails installer with no problem.

Using your real name does not automatically make you more guilty. The point of using your real name is to blend it in with the other packages you receive. USPS keeps track of names delivered to addresses. A fake name sticks out like a sore thumb to your local postman, and the USPS computers  If a package is discovered, it doesn't matter whose name is on it. It matters that they can prove that you ordered it. Using your real name does increase the chance of a smooth delivery, in the event everything goes right"

I have heard that it is possible to (if you're running Tails through a USB) to put gpg4usb on the flash drive you run Tails on and run it in Tails. However, I have not tried this as I'm also new to Tails. I have heard that the Tails PGP program is superior to others, as long as kept up to date, but that's true with everything.  I ran into this problem, as I had 2-FA enabled and could not get into my DM account through Tails because I did not have the key my PGP program for Tails.   I could disable 2 factor and then get on with Tails, change my public key with the Tails PGP program and then re-enable 2-FA, but I would rather keep my old key.

Make sure that Windows is shut down and not hibernated before you mount your Windows hard drive from Tails.  The files you need to to copy are ""secring.gpg"" and ""pubring.gpg"" and they are located where ever your gpg4usb is installed under this path ""gpg4usb\keydb"".

Obviously it's very possible and seems pretty straight forward with the directions you have provided.  Problem I have is (especially being new to Tails) I have no idea how to do this mounting stuff. Is the ""Disk Utility"" tool found while running Tails, like is this a utility tool that's part of Tails made for mounting files from foreign drives? Mounting from Windows to Tails or mounting from Tails to Windows, it has me very confused. Am I running Tails when I attempt to do this, or am I running Windows? I assume I'm running Tails (from my usb) and I attempt to access my windows hdd (where I have my gpg4usb files stored) and copy them into Tails. Am I even close to understanding this method?  I was hoping to just copy the files onto the same usb I plan to run Tails from and access them from that, but I'm guess that's not possible because the Tails OS would lock down that usb so that foreign programs could not be ran from it. Therefore, that is way you say 2nd usb, correct?  Basically I'm just confused as to how to access (mount) this data while running Tails. Once I understand this, the rest seems very simple with the direction you provided.  Perhaps I just need to explore Tails a bit and this will make more sense."

Try starting gedit (Applications > Accessories > gedit Text Editor), typing some words and then doing a Ctrl+A then Ctrl+C to copy them into the clipboard to see if you can encrypt a message.    Did you try it without enabling persistence during bootup, just to make sure that it is a persistence problem?"

I would not need to use persistence that often after I have everything imported, and I think it would be smooth sailing.   I'm going to continue reading and following the instructions to the link you provided me.

I think that's what you're looking for.   But basically you need to access your computer's bios menu, you can usually do this by hitting F2 I believe during the boot process. From there you select where (either disk or usb depending on where you downloaded Tails too) you want your computer to boot up from. So if you DL Tails to a disk, you would select that disk drive, if you DL Tails to a usb, you would select that usb drive. Then when you want your computer to boot up normal again, you go back and select the default OS, whether it be windows, mac, or linux.   At least I think that's right and I think it's what your asking.  sincerely, another noob"

Tails is a whole new OS so can't have any random installed stuff, and it'll delete everything on shutdown. And it's really not that hard. It sounded like it'd take forever but once I actually started, it was way easier than it looks. Not even an evening's work.

If you can boot Tails directly from a Tails installed Tails USB, then you can create a persistence partition on it.  You can then attach this USB to the virtual machine and boot Tails from the Tails ISO using a virtual DVD.  When the Tails ""DVD"" boots, it will see the persistent partition on the USB that is attached to the VM and ask if you want to use it.

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3aso9n,theseeker12194,18,Tue Jun 23 04:51:41 2015 UTC,"I'm going to focus on addressing the tech and speak briefly about the decision to use tails or not. Mainly because choosing to use more advanced security measures is simply a factor of your personal risk variables. While I can provide recommendations, my needs are likely very different than yours and how much you value your freedom is up to you.  Generally, when deciding whether or not to use some security solution ""x"", I like to take a look at how realistic an attack vector is (an attack vector is roughly a potential security ""weakness"". Attack vectors, generally, can be protected against by using more advanced security measures), how much it would cost an adversary to exploit it, and how valuable of a target would I be to an adversary. Several lesser variables are considered, but those three are the main ones to consider, IMO.   Tails, for the sake of discussion, is a fantastic solution that will cover most of your security needs. For that reason alone, I recommend it to new Darknet surfers. Especially for newbies that are not super tech-savvy. Because, basically, it's harder to fuck up when using Tails. Not saying it's not possible, because it totally is; anonymity requires user attention. But it's a privacy/anonymity-focused OS designed to be effective for a wide range of users. The tech you will need to surf the Darknet is baked right in. For example, Tor is essential to the modern day Darknet. Tails not only sends your web browsing traffic through Tor, it attempts to force all internet communication through Tor.   In addition, the Tails team is very active and development is constant. New threats are discussed as they become known and solutions are integrated into releases when possible/needed/etc.   But, more important than fancy tech is adopting good practices, in regards to privacy/anon.  The most important fundamental concept to understand here is a completely separate identity. Sounds simple, and it kinda is, but most people overlook less-than-obvious metadata when creating their separate identity. I used to undervalue metadata when analyzing the usage of my friends and myself. It helped me to keep in mind that metadata analysis is theoretically done at a high level across several networks by algos/computers and not humans. Basically that means: a metadata connection that seems too confusing to put together or so confusing, it would get lost in the sea of info, is likely very easily done by the adversaries that do that.  Here is a list of warnings provided by the Tor project. You can also find this list by visiting the tor project and getting to the download page where you'll find the link in a banner at the top of the page. https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en#warning  Finally, some quick notes on the tech needed to surf and shop or being discussed here.  OVERVIEW   Bitcoin (BTC) - This is the currency you'll need. Check out the subreddit for more info as there are plenty of resources nowadays. Generally, you'll want to acquire your btc in some way that doesn't simultaneously reveal your identity. Tor – I believe Tor was originally an acronym that stood for“The Onion Router”. I think it's officially dropped now and simply referred to as Tor. Anyways, Tor is the traffic routing software that keeps your actual IP private and allows you to access “.onion “ sites. Aka “hidden services” though I think that title is going to be dropped soon since it's kinda confusing.  The Tor Browser, or The Tor Browser Bundle – Is technically separate from Tor itself. You see, Tor is the underlying protocol and the Tor browser is what most people use to actually use the protocol. You can install the Tor browser on most OS's and you should always download it from the official torproject.org site.  *PGP, or Pretty Good Privacy – Fun fact most people don't know, one of the first bitcoin developers (the recipient of the first btc transaction from Satoshi) is also one of the core developers of PGP. I'm too lazy to look it up right now, but there was an article written on the guy during the “find Satoshi hype” last year or the year prior. Obviously a gifted individual! More info on PGP  below. Tails – Debian Linux based system that incorporates the tech described here on a USB bootable OS. Or DVD, or maybe SD card. Several install scenarios are described on the Tails site. Software is all Open source and free. The only thing that comes close to this project is Whonix and I would stay far far away from any other similar software.    PGP is the encryption software you will use to encrypt messages you send to people. It involves software that manages your PGP keys and the public keys of recipients. There are several good tutorials online with a number residing in Reddit.   PGP is probably the most confusing software for a newbie to use. Unfortunately, for said newbie, it's also one of the most important. You will need to send an address if you plan to purchase anything while on the darknet and failing to encrypt your address is a pretty major security risk. PGP ensures no “eavesdropping” will occur; your message will be read (hopefully!) only by you and your recipient."

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3asu75,smokumdude,2,Tue Jun 23 05:58:35 2015 UTC,"So, assuming you don't feel the need to mix your bitcoin prior to sending to the marketplace, here is what you could do.  Once you've purchased your btc from Coinbase, it will be in your Coinbase wallet. Since Coinbase is now sorta like a bank, they have regulators and, basically, a bunch of twats monitoring their every move. These twats are totally opposed to btc being used for anything, so you want to make it slightly more difficult for said twats to see what the btc is used for. Slightly more difficult is enough to shake em.  You need a btc wallet. You can use a web-based btc wallet for maximum ease, or read a little and learn how to use a local wallet. If you're gonna go web wallet, use blockchain.info... because.. tech. Read up on their approach to security if you're curious, but basically, it's the only web wallet worth a damn.  With blockchain, you can create a fuckton of btc addresses. Which is good, because you should never reuse addresses. Think of btc addresses as bubble wrap and using an address gives you the same satisfaction as popping some of those little bubbles.  Once you send from Coinbase to blockchain, you'll need to send from blockchain to the market. Log into your market account and you'll see a wallet page. Visit that page and you should see a btc address which you can use for deposits.  For kicks, you can watch blocks get mined and even see your transaction transmit through the web in real-time on blockchain.info. Every btc transaction takes a few minutes because you'll need to wait for a few confirmations. Confirmations are done when new blocks are mined. Every new block mined pops up on blockchain's home page along with it's size, time, transactions included and other cool shit. So you can see your confirmations as they happen. Especially useful for those of us with OCD or generally impatient.  Good luck!"

Is there any specific reason to use Windows 7 as the host OS? It's a topic of hot debate but I think Microsoft spies on its users for a variety of reasons. I recommend a Linux distribution. What VPN will you be using? How will you pay for it? (Is it paid at all? If it's free, don't even bother, you're opening more security holes than you're closing.) What VPN software will you be using? Personally, I wouldn't recommend using a VPN at all. The tl;dr is that you're creating a centralized point of failure by using a VPN but I can get more into the technical details of this if you'd like, too. How will you buy your bitcoins? What kind of options does your PayPal account vendor offer for the accounts they sell? Can you pick whether the account has a fixed balance or is connected to a bank account/CC? Can you choose accounts based on where the account holder lives? How much will you be paying per account? Are refunds available for accounts that don't work? VirtualBox is a great option, but what OS will you be virtualizing? Personally I recommend Android. PayPal's site is loaded with triggers that can lock the account down (like how visiting the account with an unknown browser will lock the account down, for example) that the mobile app doesn't have. Where are you getting your SOCKS proxies? If you're getting them from a public list, don't even bother. PayPal will lock that account down instantly, they monitor all those public lists. Also, how do you plan to tunnel from Tor to the proxy? (I recommend privoxy, which as far as I know is only available on Linux.) How do you plan to use the money in the PayPal account?

The solution is to use a wireless card with better Linux support. You could swap the card from your old laptop into the new machine, or just buy an Atheros wireless card for $5 on ebay that's compatible with the new system and install it.  The long-term solution is to write a polite but upset email to the computer's manufacturer asking them to use hardware that has better support in Linux.  Also, reverse-engineering drivers takes time, so if your new card really is quite new, there's a decent chance that it will become supported in the next year or two."

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3ahy88,urdank6,6,Sun Jun 21 16:11:58 2015 UTC,"First, do two spaces after every line on a list so it is formatted properly.     If you post your full address on a market, other people can see it.  No telling what they might do.  Could be LE sees it and pays you a visit. Could be some jerk tries to blackmail you.  When you use PGP, your address in ONLY visible to the vendor.  Even the market admins can't see it, and if LE gets the server, they can't see it anyway.   Surfing darknet sites is not illegal.  Buying drugs or other illegal stuff is.   Most markets have an escrow system.  You put in money, the market holds it for you.  If you get the drugs, then the market releases it to the vendor. If not, you open a dispute and you might get your money back.  It is a gamble that works MOST of the time, but not always.  Don't spend any money you can't afford to lose.   Most stuff is sealed really well.  There is no such thing as a magic ""drug detector"" that can find drugs in a well-sealed package.  Usually they are looking for characteristics of the package itself.  There is a TON of mail volume across country borders, which is why it usually works.  Ordering outside your country is usually more risky than inside, where the mail isn't scrutinized as much.     If you are posting here without actually admitting to doing something illegal, you are totally safe in in the US and most other countries.  AFAIK, no one has been arrested based upon a Reddit post.  A couple of guys were subpoena'd when they claimed to know who ran a darknet site, but that was it.  People admit to ordering from the darknet all the time, and many dealers post about their activities and nothing seems to happen to them.  Good luck and stay safe."

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3ajrug,sapiophile,2,Sun Jun 21 12:50:16 2015 UTC,"Coinbase wallet > Windows electrum wallet> tails electrum wallet...Still havent decided to tumble or send to market from here. Thoughts?   That was a big mistake. Using Electrum in a non-anonymous environment is a really bad idea. You have just created an indelible record connecting your non-anonymous wallet to your ""anonymous"" wallet (which is no longer anonymous). This is actually one of the few times that using a tumbler is very valuable, in my opinion.  This can be fixed, but you will need to follow these instructions very closely. Here's what you need to do:   Make sure you have your 12-word seeds for your wallets written down well (always!) Start up Tails without restoring your persistence Electrum wallet, which is tainted. Create a brand new, fresh wallet with Electrum on Tails, write down the 12-word seed (always!), and copy a couple of its receiving addresses into a simple text document. Now close Electrum. Make sure that it closes completely. Open the file manager in Tails, go to your Home directory, press Ctrl+H to ""Show Hidden Files"" (also selectable from the ""View"" menu), and find the directory called .electrum. Open that up, then open the directory inside it called wallets, and then delete everything in there. Click the Tor button in the top panel of Tails and select ""Use a New Identity,"" and wait for it to confirm. Re-open Electrum. It should now prompt you to create a new wallet all over again. If it does not, something is wrong - DO NOT PROCEED, ask here for help. Tell it that you want to restore an existing wallet from its Seed, and enter your old, tainted wallet's seed (the one that has the money in it). Fire up the Tor Browser and go to your tumbler of choice. Use the addresses from the fresh, new wallet (the one that's actually untainted and anonymous) you made earlier (that you copied to a text file) to Receive from the tumbler, and then send from your tainted Electrum wallet (which should still be open) to the tumbler. After the transaction emptying the funds from the tainted wallet has a couple of confirmations, it's just a waiting game. Shut down Tails completely and wait some time (hopefully several hours at least) for the tumbler to do its magic. When you re-start Tails the next day or whatever, this time you can restore your persistent data (if you use it). Again, open the file manager in Tails, go to your Home directory, press Ctrl+H to ""Show Hidden Files"" (also selectable from the ""View"" menu), and find the directory called .electrum. Open that up, then open the directory inside it called wallets, and then delete everything in there. Start up Electrum, and tell it to restore from an existing seed. If it opens your old wallet, DO NOT PROCEED, ask here for help. Enter the 12-word Seed of the NEWER, non-tainted wallet, and then let it sync. You should see your coins now in the new, actually anonymous wallet. You're basically done, at this point. Get rid of any trace of the old, tainted wallets and go on with your life using the new, actually anonymous one. And learn from this mistake (using Electrum in any way except the one that's bundled with Tails) to not do this again."

Shifting through wallets like what you did is just so the pricks at coinbase don't ban your account.   I'll let others chime in too though but those are just my thoughts.

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3agdo9,throwitin_thetrash,2,Fri Jun 19 22:49:14 2015 UTC,"No, that's a silly way to do it. The only reason why people use ""web wallets"" like Blockchain.info's is because that's where they're buying coin (although obviously BC.i doesn't sell coin). If you don't have a reason to, then bringing a 3rd-party web wallet into the equation is a totally stupid thing to do.  If the ATM doesn't identify you in any way (many do not), then you could just send direct to the market's deposit address, as the coins are ""clean"" already if they're not tied to your identity. But don't do something stupid like plug the deposit address into some online QR code generator - keep all traffic tying you to that address local, on your own machine, using free, open-source software running on your own computer.  Otherwise, why not just use Tails and its integrated Electrum wallet? You mention it so you obviously know about it - what's stopping you from using it? Ideally, you can even create the wallet and the its receiving addresses completely offline. It can be a little involved to do - you'll have to create a wallet, write down the 12-word seed, then right-click some receiving addresses and display their QR code, then copy the image to the clipboard, then open up the included GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) and create an image of it that you can print out. Or, as a last resort, transfer the image onto an anonymous, ""burner"" phone (don't use a phone tied to your actual identity) directly over the local wifi network or via physical microSD card copy (don't send that identifying QR code over the internet). Tails will work with many printers out of the box.  So what's stopping you from using Tails, anyway?"

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3agn8n,ziz1,2,Sat Jun 20 00:18:06 2015 UTC,"You might try this method to verify the ISO instead:  An easy way to verify the integrity of the Tails ISO on Windows is to install the HashTab utility.  It will calculate various file hashes by selecting a file in windows explorer, right clicking on it and selecting Properties -> ""File Hashes"".  You can download HashTab from here:  http://www.majorgeeks.com/mg/getmirror/hashtab,1.html  Once the file is downloaded, right click on it and select ""Extract All"".  Hit Extract.  Double click on ""HashTab v5.x.x.x Setup"" to install it.  Run through the default installer steps.  Once it is installed, right click on the Tails ISO in the file manager and select Properties.  Click on the File Hashes tab.  Click on the blue ""Settings"" below the hash values.  Check mark ""SHA-256"".  Check mark ""Use lowercase hash values"".  Hit OK.  The SHA256 hash value should now appear at the bottom of the Hash Value screen (after a small calculation delay).  (You will need to hover your mouse over the SHA-256 line to see the complete value.)  You can right click on the SHA256 value and select Copy to copy it into the clipboard.  The latest SHA256 hash for the ISO can be found here:  https://tails.boum.org/inc/stable_i386_hash/  Also here:  https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html (Do a Ctrl-F to search for ""sha256"")  An easy way to compare the hash value from the website to the one from HashTab is to copy them into a notepad window one below the other.  If the SHA256 hashes match, the ISO file verifies as good and you are ready to install it."

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3adlto,ChampignGlass,2,Fri Jun 19 06:45:41 2015 UTC,"This sounds like an XY Problem.  What is it that you're actually attempting to do? Like as your final goal. Why do you want to send coins from your Multibit wallet to a Blockchain wallet? And I assume you're talking about a blockchain.info wallet, and not anything else, right? If not, what are you talking about?   Also, do you deduct that from how much you have in the wallet when you need to transfer between multibit to blockhain?   I'm not sure I understand, but I'll try. Yes, when you transfer bitcoin from one wallet to another, the amount that you sent (plus the miner fee) is deducted from the sending wallet. It should do this for you automatically.  1 satoshi is 1/100,000,000th of a bitcoin. It is the smallest possible denomination of Bitcoin (for the forseeable future). 5,460 satoshis is the absolute minimum size transfer that's acceptable on the Bitcoin network (at the moment), in order to prevent cheap, tiny transactions from ""spamming"" Bitcoin. It is a very small amount (worth about $0.01 USD), and is equivalent to 54.6 bits or 0.00005460 bitcoins.  But to get back to your actual problem - what is it that you're actually trying to do? I can't seem to think of any possible problem that would be solved by moving coins from a Multibit wallet to a Blockchain.info wallet. What is the problem you're trying to solve?"
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3adlto,sapiophile,1 point,Sat Jun 20 07:06:34 2015 UTC,I figured out that I didn't have enough yo send to the other wallet. I wanted to do a test send as my first try so I don't mess up in the future when it comes to sending bitcoins.

Along with stealth, communication etc of course. If vendors doesn't have reviews they're probably new or something and you can take a chance ordering from them and take a bullet for the rest of us if he's bad.

At the end of the day LE don't care about personal use anywhere near as much as vendors/dealers. If you don't fit into any of those you'll be fine. Pretty sure i've seen domestic vendors for both products so go with them, even if price is more (will help with both the anxiety of ordering and chance of receiving.)"

You can download HashTab from here:  http://www.majorgeeks.com/mg/getmirror/hashtab,1.html  Once the file is downloaded, right click on it and select ""Extract All"".  Hit Extract.  Double click on ""HashTab v5.x.x.x Setup"" to install it.  Run through the default installer steps.  Once it is installed, right click on the Tails ISO in the file manager and select Properties.  Click on the File Hashes tab.  Click on the blue ""Settings"" below the hash values.  Check mark ""SHA-256"".  Check mark ""Use lowercase hash values"".  Hit OK.  The SHA256 hash value should now appear at the bottom of the Hash Value screen (after a small calculation delay).  (You will need to hover your mouse over the SHA-256 line to see the complete value.)  You can right click on the SHA256 value and select Copy to copy it into the clipboard.  The latest SHA256 hash for the ISO can be found here:  https://tails.boum.org/inc/stable_i386_hash/  Also here:  https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html (Do a Ctrl-F to search for ""sha256"")  An easy way to compare the hash value from the website to the one from HashTab is to copy them into a notepad window one below the other.  If the SHA256 hashes match, the ISO file verifies as good and you are ready to install it."

Your chances of an order being seized are near 0 unless you have been telling people that you will drugs in the mail.  Most vendors these days use heat sealed MBB, which prevents any scent from escaping the package. Further, many vendors do not pack their orders in the same room that they keep weed in. Some vendors will prefer to bag up their product in a series of unimportant bags before ultimately putting the weed in an MBB, as to prevent the outside of the MBB being contaminated.

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,39xp5o,zeeblebroxx,0,Mon Jun 15 17:25:18 2015 UTC,"Keep them reserved. This is the general consensus. If there be a hiccup, the *vendor** can check it first — following proper protocol. If it gets hot enough to ring in the Support team, they too may get a peek. THEN AGAIN — experience with a coupla deals often got the tracking number, at nothing was harmed. do NOT check from TOR bescause USPS knows that someone is using this service. For most packages, track occassionally from tje home n' shit - after all, it's still a package. Topping it off, they have your name and address -(on the package)...  SOME USE EXTERNAL CHECKING SERVICES  And that's just fine — sometimes even a little better   (( www.17track.net )) — the only example I could concieved - there are many other similar services. Listed Service is often used for Chinese packages akongt others.   ——&& So, I generally would hold off on the tracking number — unless the vendor gives them out prompt. As a side note, a general window of ~6-7 days allowance before bitching at your vendor. MUCH APPRECIATED — Once it's been dropped it is out of control of the Vendor. So be kind — not all vendors are (practicallly) corporations // quite a few are individuals. So be patient...   ^(Shit, I save dinero by purchasing the First Class option because fuck that *damn fast* — flamin' hot delivery? But that is totally NOT recommended — spring for the quicker shippings, when possible.

If not, is the persistence partition at least encrypted?   Yes. The persistence volume is an encrypted partition that takes up all of the unused space on the USB drive and comes right after the Tails OS partition.   or even lost then    If you are a Windows user, you can use this program to make a backup image of your entire Tails USB including persistence:  http://www.alexpage.de/usb-image-tool/download/  If your Tails USB fails or is lost at some point, you can use this tool to write the image back out to a 2nd USB of the exact same size or larger and be ready to go with a bootable Tails USB with all of your persistence data intact. Best to buy a few USB flash drives of the same model number so that you are more likely to get drives of the same size. You can test your backup system by backing up an image of your Tails USB and then writing it back out to a 2nd USB. Boot from the 2nd USB and make sure that all of your data has been saved."

It's not the computer - I've tried several all with independent installations of the software - it's not the tails stick - I have two functioning sticks that are completely different sizes/brands of usb, created at different times (but both from the same Daddy lol).  At this point it's not even that I want to make the damn  copy - it's a grudge match. I cannot handle being defeated by a piece of software or hardware. I know will return to this periodically bc it will nag at me. I'll keep at it until it works or they pry the thumb drives out of my cold dead hands.  It doesn't even fail at the same point consistently, but the last time I tried, after I'd intensively studied every word of available documentation (I was like, ""OK motherfucker, tonight you're goin DOWN!"") I got the furthest. It was at 99% complete writing the copy to the new drive. And there it remained.i let it sit all night like that and finally got the failure message."
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,39vrjd,radium_fire,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:00:01 2015 UTC,"Wow, what a bummer.  I looked around for awhile to try and find a Windows program that could be used to create an image of a Tails USB. This tool was the only one I could find that would actually recognize that the Tails USB existed. Because windows won't assign a drive letter to a Tails USB (probably because it uses an EFI partition code of ""EF00""), most programs won't even show that the Tails USB is inserted.  Since it sounds like you were able to get it to read the image from the original USB and save it to the hard drive, you might try a different program to write the image back out to the 2nd USB.  http://www.osforensics.com/tools/write-usb-images.html  http://rufus.akeo.ie/  (use ""DD"" mode instead of ""ISO"")  I tried both of the above programs and was able to successfully write out a Tails image to a USB drive with them."

Your arrangements will depend on your negotiation skills and your friends.  I regularly ship drugs to friends' place in exchange for giving them wholesale prices on drugs to diversify risk in our group.  The vendor you choose will depend on your location, your need for stealth and your desired quantity.  Setup Tails (it has every tool you need for this), browse a market, see a vendor that offers the quantities you want, then look for reviews on Reddit, Grams Infodesk, and the marketplace.  See if the vague descriptions of stealth sound like what you want to receive.  Keep in mind that LSD is primarily distributed on small pieces of paper and can be disguised as a letter, not a package.

That being said there's a whole other spectrum to think about,  If you look at the charges of various busted vendors/buyers etc the charge of aiding and embedding a criminal enterprise is almost always there if the tie to the market is made.  Since a portion (no matter how small) of your purchase is still going towards the entire operation you're seen as a criminal still in the eyes of the law.  To put it simply, OPSEC is always important if you plan on purchasing anything on the markets.  But it is good to keep it in your mind that while it is possible for this to happen, if you're just buying digital data the chances are significantly lower risk as compared to purchasing physical goods.

Moreover, given the US-German relation (or, I should say very large amount of intel gathering by the US) I wouldn't trust any digital service related to security which servers are based in Germany. Sigaint's server locations are not even known. I see no problem using PGP+Sigaint. In addition, don't trust any online encryption service, ie.: tutanota.

I also don't like how they designed it to work best between tutanota accounts instead of all e-mail providers. I'd rather use PGP encryption and have the option to contact anyone on any service with just as much simplicity.  I have noticed more vendors using Sigaint so I may check that out. I think vendors should use multiple e-mail servers in case one is compromised. In my opinion, if they are all using one service, that service is most likely to be attacked/breached. If the security is good enough, it still draws too much attention when every vendor is using one service."

As for tumbling, many (maybe most personal buyer) don't, what you do need to do is send them to an intermediate wallet - so maybe a blockchain wallet, or one on electrum on tails.   To transfer to a DNM wallet, when you log on to the DNM you'll be able to find your wallet recieving address on there so you'll just send your coins to that."
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,398pze,darknetpotter,2,Wed Jun 10 13:29:06 2015 UTC,"This is what I do. Blockchain has a great wallet service and has an option to make ""mixed"" transactions which mix your coins up with other people's before sending them to your intended address.

There is an option to donate a random .5 - 1% to blockchain but other than that it does not cost anything."

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,395sqi,Renikenna,6,Tue Jun 9 13:37:12 2015 UTC,"Yep, that should get you to where you need to go. A few things to keep in mind:   IMPORTANT! The markets are heaving with more turmoil and weirdness than I've seen since Ross Ulbrichts empire collapsed. This is due to the suspected exit scam that a certain major site pulled about 2 weeks ago, and a massive DDoS attack. You will see a lot of different opinions about which is the best site. I'm trying to stay within the rules for posting comments (no mention of specific deepweb sites), my favorite site is named after the central gathering place for ancient Greeks. They have a great selection of vendors for every kind of product. Always use the Reddit Superlist to get the correct address for a given darknet site. You will find practically all active markets consolidated on that page. Some addresses found by other means (deepdotweb, Google searches, etc,) are scams, giving you a false address to a phishing link, but reddit is always up to date. Many vendors who are perfectly legitimate and have great products are exclusively FE (Finalize Early). DO NOT make your first transaction FE! Do your homework, look at feedback scores, how long they have been active, total number of transactions completed, etc, and choose a vendor who accepts escrow. It will cost a bit more, but escrow covers your ass and provides protection. The vendor doesn't get paid until you finalize, and that should only occur AFTER you have the product in hand. If you just want to browse products and vendors, then you are good to go. If you want to buy that great-looking ounce of whatever, you will need Bitcoins. For me, browsing localbitcoins.com and seeking out a seller who takes cash deposits into their checking accounts is a fast and reliable way to convert dollars into Bitcoins. Also, for extra safety look up ""bitcoin tumblers"" and how to use them (this is a prudent but not a mandatory step.) ALWAYS USE PGP ENCRYPTION!!! I cannot emphasize this enough. The technical details of how this works are well beyond the scope of this post, but a search through reddit will give you step-by-step instructions for how and why you must use PGP software (gpg4win in your case).   This is only an outline of what you need to do, and it's not nearly as intimidating as it looks. This last part is probably the most important:   TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS!!! If a deal looks too good to be true, then assume it is. If you want to buy something from a specific vendor, but the vendor seems unreliable and sloppy, use a different vendor. There is no excuse for poor Operational Security (OpSec).   Hope this helps…"

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,392sl0,gpgpractice6,3,Mon Jun 8 21:03:41 2015 UTC,"Basically, unless they're tracking the mail of someone specific, they use a system based on suspicion. If a package stands out for the wrong reasons (there are lists floating around, cant give you all the signs but a lot of them are pretty innocuous) then it may be investigated further using x-rays, dogs or actually searching it.   At the end of the day though, so much mail is handled daily that it would be impossible for them to check even half of it. As unhelpful as it sounds, beyond a vendor doing their very best, the rest is down to simple luck."

In the unlikely event it gets seized, sometimes they just simply send you a love letter and that's the end of it and in an even more unlikely event LE looks into it, you can easily cover your tracks using TAILS.   So basically do this.  Use TAILS Transfer your bitcoin to a middle wallet before sending it to a DNM.

If that is correct, you should read and look into vending guides because it seems to me that you don't have much clue of how this process goes on.  There's a lot of stuff you need to consider, and these questions cover just a few of them. To provide ""ultimate"" stealth, as you say, vendors usually use decoys. It could be any kind of product that would mislead customs thinking that it's just an ordinary package. Could be anything from box of sweets to sometimes things more complex as phones or other devices. The key point is to make it look innocent.   Do custom people open it up in any case?   Yes, such packages can still get opened and investigated. But that doesn't mean that your package will get seized. If a decoy is good enough, the package will go through. If not, drugs inside might be left and sent with a love letter to your customer, or seized. There are a lot of specifics related to this, so if you are going to vend, you should definetely look into it.   Also, are the any custom duties that are needed to be paid at delivery time?

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,38zqg5,oracle_gl,3,Mon Jun 8 04:59:01 2015 UTC,"1 - It's not techincally necessary but more up to your discretion.  In my honest opinion if you're ordering for personal use there's no real need to use a tumbler and to just send it around to a few wallets before sending it to your DNM wallet.  That being said if you're nervous and it'll put your mind at ease by all means do it.  The thing about tumblers is it's simply just another step in the process of proper opsec but if LE is at the point in the investigation about you that they're grasping at btc transfers you're likely fucked already.  2 - I'd highly highly highly advise against ordering to your work even if it is okay with your superiors, if something were to ever happen that ramifications would be even worse than if it happened at your residence.  If receiving packages at home (for some reason) isn't an option your next best bet is a PO box or waiting till you can receive them at your own address.   3 - This is a good PGP guide and the one I personally used to learn way back when.

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,38vvvx,Sinji_,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:47:42 2015 UTC,"The blockchain isn't really something you ""send"" coins to, it's how bitcoin is tracked while being traded.  So lets break down your process here.  First you buy bitcoin from someone on LBC, the send it from their personal wallet to your personal (electrum) wallet.  Although this will be a simple transfer from personal accounts this will still be able to be viewed on blockchain.info because that's how bitcoin is tracked.    Second you'll send it to a tumbler, much like the first transfer you'll just send it to an address and the transaction will show up on the blockchain as per normal, then through a process of splitting that up in a many many transactions going through many wallets the tumbler works to make the purchase anonymous.  All the money minus the fee of the tumbler will then be deposited into the final wallet address (the marketplace)  What I think you're confusing yourself with is the idea of an onsite wallet.  On blockchain.info you have the option to obtain a wallet onsite to store bitcoins in, there are more services like this than you can count and provides some degree of risk because people can just run off with your bitcoins (same idea as an exit scam on the markets, however this is incredibly unlikely).

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,38vvvx,hksupport,1 point,Sun Jun 7 13:18:24 2015 UTC,"You are right that you could claim you just paid somebody.  But there is still a clear connection of some kind between the LBC account and the Electrum account.  Whoever owns the LBC account knows at least something about who owns the Electrum account if the LBC account sent money to the Electrum account.  You may find yourself under scrutiny if somehow LE finds the Electrum wallet doing something bad and they see your LBC address sent money to it.  By tumbling from LBC to Electrum, you place a hard break, a digital brick wall, between the LBC wallet and the Electrum wallet.  No connection between the two exists (assuming you can trust the tumbler).  You can then also just claim you paid somebody (the address of the tumbler), but that still doesn't provide any link from the LBC wallet to the Electrum wallet.  In the first instance, there is a connection, but in the second scenario, there is no connection.  In both instances, you can say you sent coins away from LBC and you don't know what happened after that... but I'd still sleep better at night without a clear link between the two wallets."

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,38vvvx,hksupport,1 point,Mon Jun 8 08:41:03 2015 UTC,"It depends on how you use your Electrum wallet.  If you only use it for DNM purchases, then you want to tumble coins that go into it, and then you have a easy to use configuration for getting coins in and out of the markets.  If on the other hand you want to use the Electrum wallet for other personal and identifiable things, you'd want to NOT link it with dnm's, so you'd tumble coins between it and the market.  I was making the (perhaps incorrect) assumption above that he would have the Eelectrum wallet solely for dnm use.  The setup you have can vary depending on what you're trying to accomplish.  Tumblers simply obscure the link between one wallet and another, so depending on what your intentions with one or another wallet/address is, you should use the tumbler accordingly."

Just like some people use tumblers and some don't, there's no right and wrong. People can tell your their preferred methods, you have to pick for yourself.  The way I see it, if tumbling is your last step then your DNM activity can never be linked to you because you don't have any time to mess things up - the last step is unlinking from your identity. If you do it any earlier and mess things up on any later steps then it doesn't matter that you tumbled, the coins have been linked to you again."

But sooner or later it'd probably go back to market for a second purchase.)  In any case, I might just simplify matters and go for LBC->Electrum->DNM, skipping tumbling altogether. Not sure though...

Blockchain is a website where you can see every transaction made in the btcnetwork and also you can make an online wallet there which you transfer your coins from your normal wallet(the hot wallet) to. Go to blockchain.info and then on wallet there you can create it.

Tell the clerk to put it in an envelope. This way you dont get prints on them. Clerks don't even blink an eye when you ask to do this.  Ask for USPS 400 labels. This is for tracking. Occasionally you might get an odd look for this but just be cool. You aren't doing anything illegal yet.  Try to find the smaller letter sized priority envelopes because those are the shit for mailing drugs. They are like 1/3 the size of a regular priority envelope and printed labels look better on them IMO.  WEAR 2 PAIRS OF GLOVES WHILE PACKAGING.  WEAR A PAIR OF FORM FITTING TO YOUR FINGER LEATHER GLOVES WHEN DOING THE DROP IN A RANDOM BLUE BOX AN HOUR AWAY FROM YOUR HOUSE.  I have shipped hundreds of drug packages this way while I vended on EVO for a year. Fuck what all these people are saying about using somebody else's identity to get a prepaid card.

I then place an order using PGP.  Then I simply wait.  Once it arrives in the mail and i'm able to check the quality of the product, I go back and release the funds from escrow to the vendor and leave a review.

One of the first things I got stuck with and (stupidly) didn't realise for a while was where the replys from vendors actually went once they wanted to reply to you.

Yes, or if you are able to create a persistent volume on your Tails USB, then you can save it using a single USB.  You should backup your secret keys somewhere. USB flashdrives can be very unreliable.  Windows users can use this tool to make a backup image of their Tails USB with persistence:  http://www.alexpage.de/usb-image-tool/download/     Do the vendors reply to your encrypted message with another encrypted message ON your inbox on the particular market that you are using?   Normally they would probably reply with an unencrypted message, unless they are sending you sensitive information. They will reply back to you using the same market messaging system that you used to send them the encrypted message, though. Normally all communications with a vendor take place through the market messaging system. The only time you would normally email a vendor is if the market was down for an extended period of time or you were doing direct off market deals with the vendor."

I was wondering where the hell the messages went/came from when talking to a vendor but now I know its just dealt with through the inbox/messaging system of the market that you are dealing with. The only reason I ask about the encrypted volume is that I don't have another USB stick. Would you recommend I buy another whilst I am out tomorrow to just create a persistence volume? Also, are vendors able to see the information on my profile?

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,38pn84,ziz1,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:19:58 2015 UTC,"Would you recommend I buy another whilst I am out tomorrow to just create a persistence volume?   Yes, but get a couple. If you get ones from the same manufacturer and same advertised size, there's a good chance that they will be the exact same size. If they are the exact same size, then you can use that USB imaging tool to create an image of your Tails USB with persistence then write that image back out to another USB of the exact same size or larger and have a bootable backup drive with all of your persistent data safe and sound.  So, to summarize:  Get two USB drives of the exact same size.  Put Tails on USB1 using Rufus.  Boot USB1.  Install Tails on USB2 using the Tails installer from USB1.  Remove USB1 and set it aside for later.  Boot Tails from USB2.  Configure the persistent volume.  Reboot to have the persistent volume settings take effect.  Generate your PGP key(s) on Tails.  Reboot Tails to make sure that your keys were properly saved on the persistence volume.  Shutdown Tails.  Start Windows.  Make a backup image of the 2nd USB with Tails and persistence using the USB Image Tool.  Write that image back out to the 1st Tails drive that you set aside earlier.  Boot from that 1st USB drive to make sure that it now has a persistent volume and all of your saved data.     So I just put the PGP key that I am going to use forever on my profile and then when I message a vendor from then they will see it and reply by using it?   Yes."

Boot Tails and do not enable persistence, but do select ""More options > Yes"".  Enter an administration password (twice) and hit Login.  Identify the drive letter of the Tails USB by starting the Disk Utility program (Applications > Accessories > Disk Utility).  Maximize the Disk Utility Window.  Locate your USB on the left pane and click on it to select it.  The device name for your current Tails drive should be on the upper right side next to ""Device"". Make note of it.  Insert your blank backup USB drive. (The backup drive must be larger or the exact same size - to the byte.)  Locate it on the left pane and select it.  Make note of its device name.  Start a command line terminal window (small black box on the upper left menu bar).  Type the following command and the administrative password to become root:  sudo su   (Enter the password. It will not show on the screen.)  The dd command will take the form of:  dd  if=/dev/your-tails-usb  of=/dev/your-blank-backup-usb   ""if"" is input file and ""of"" is output file.

A dd command with one system hard drive and two USB drives would look like this:  dd  if=/dev/sdb  of=/dev/sdc  bs=1M  &&  sync   A dd command with no system hard drive and two USB drives would look like this:  dd  if=/dev/sda  of=/dev/sdb  bs=1M  &&  sync   If you use the wrong drive letters in the dd command, you will wipe out your system disk or your Tails USB.

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,38ng1c,ziz1,2,Fri Jun 5 21:28:36 2015 UTC,"If you are a vendor, then absolutely. Vendors are especially vulnerable to the current HSDir deanonimization attack if they use special vendor only non-public URLs to reach a marketplace.  http://www.pcworld.com/article/2928752/tor-connections-to-hidden-services-could-be-easy-to-deanonymize.html  If you are a personal use buyer, a low cost dedicated external VPN router could give you some extra piece of mind.    At a minimum, Tails users should pick a Tor relay to use as a bridge and then stick with that bridge whenever they use Tails. Since by default, Tails is amnesiac, it can't remember what guard it used the last time it booted and will therefore cycle through all of the guard relays, using a different one each time you boot. This cycling will eventually end up with you randomly picking a guard node and HSDir node (or exit node) run by the same bad guys (FBI / CERT). If that happens, they can link your access to the hidden service with your home IP address. If you pick a relay that you think you can trust from the public relay list and always enter that when booting Tails, it should prevent this problem.

Yes. If you save something in /home/amnesia/Persistent you can delete it from there if you need to.

Finally, you may have issues with the computer booting from linux so after the install you may need to get Linux boot repair (just google it) and it will repair the boot sector and let you boot into your new OS. Windows 8.1 will be completely gone and any data not backed up on some other medium will be gone though.  Since you're posting in DarkNetMarketsNoobs I would assume you want to use Linux for security reasons and go on the dark net.

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,38bdde,ziz1,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:27:10 2015 UTC,There are usually multiple partitions on a Windows drive. The C: drive is most likely the largest partition.

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,38b2kg,John-Thackery,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:39:36 2015 UTC,"So if I'm connecting to https reddit, can I look at r/DNM without my ISP seeing that?   Correct. They only see the domain that you are connecting to (reddit.com), not the rest of the URL (/r/DarkNetMarkets) or any of the things that you read or post..  From here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS:   Because HTTPS piggybacks HTTP entirely on top of TLS, the entirety of the underlying HTTP protocol can be encrypted. This includes the request URL (which particular web page was requested), query parameters, headers, and cookies (which often contain identity information about the user). However, because host (website) addresses and port numbers are necessarily part of the underlying TCP/IP protocols, HTTPS cannot protect their disclosure. In practice this means that even on a correctly configured web server, eavesdroppers can infer the IP address and port number of the web server (sometimes even the domain name e.g. www.example.org, but not the rest of the URL) that one is communicating with as well as the amount (data transferred) and duration (length of session) of the communication, though not the content of the communication."

One way is to boot from your Tails USB and use it to install Tails to a 2nd USB.   Applications > Tails > Tails Installer  You then remove the 1st USB and set it aside (it is no longer needed). Boot Tails from the 2nd USB and configure ""persistence"".  Applications > Tails > Configure persistent volume  The persistent volume is an encrypted partition on the Tails USB that is automatically mounted at boot time and can be used to save your important info (PGP keys, wallets, passwords, etc.)  Choose a strong multi-word passphrase to protect it.  Enable ALL of the persistence options.  Once you are done, reboot to have changes take effect.  Test each part of the persistence before relying on it to save your info to make sure that it is working. (Generate a test PGP key, a test Electrum wallet, save a test file in /home/amnesia/Persistent, then reboot and make sure they are all still saved.)  https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/persistence/configure/index.en.html    If, for some reason you cannot get persistence to work or you do not want to use a persistent volume, you can use a 2nd USB as a kind of manual persistence by using this method to create an encrypted volume on it:  https://tails.boum.org/doc/encryption_and_privacy/encrypted_volumes/index.en.html"

Basically if I had someone use their credit card to send bitcoins to me (still a new process to me....do I need a program to access them?) I could then tumble ( I'm assuming similar to laundering ) then trade that for cash using localbitcoins?

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,38ah8t,hksupport,2,Wed Jun 3 04:04:50 2015 UTC,"Tails comes with electrum pre-installed on it, since you're already running tails open it up and have a look. You don't really need a smartphone, you can do it on your PC through tails and I'd recommend that as tails is more secure than a smartphone OS will be. Tumbling - you just send your coins to the tumbler (so the tumbler will give you an address to send them to, you can send your coins from electrum) and the tumbler will give you some new coins (minus their fee) that you can withdraw to a different wallet.  This could be electrum on your PC on windows/OS, or again, an online wallet. These coins are now 'clean' and you can sell them.  Btw many people don't tumble and think it isn't necessary, so an alternative would be to just send your coins through a few random wallets."

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,383ya3,Eyeamthe1,9,Mon Jun 1 18:03:51 2015 UTC,Tails is an operating system that does not store any information (unless Persistence Volume is used an enabled.)

Tails is a Linux based security and anonymity focused operating system that you boot on your computer from a DVD or a USB flash drive.  https://tails.boum.org/   Why is it important that I use it?   Tails normally doesn't write to your internal hard drive so that once it is shut down, there is no evidence of its use left on your computer. Tails can be setup with an encrypted ""persistence partition"" to save your PGP keys and other important info.   If you don't use Tails and your computer is seized, evidence of your using the darknet markets could be left on it for the authorities to locate and use against you."

Basically yes. You will probably need to change the device boot order in your BIOS setup so that the machine will try and boot from the USB drive before the internal hard drive. The BIOS on some PC's will have a dedicated key to get into a device boot menu. (Dells use F12, and HPs use F9). Depending on how new your machine is, you may also need to disable ""Secure Boot"" and enable ""Legacy Boot"".  You might want to use Rufus over other USB installers to write the ISO file to the USB drive.  http://rufus.akeo.ie/  Use the default values, except:  Change the drop down for ""bootable disk using"" from FreeDOS to ISO Image.

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,383ya3,ziz1,3,Mon Jun 1 22:51:42 2015 UTC,"I believe that it is a good idea to use a VPN when using Tor, but unfortunately, Tails does not directly support VPNs:  https://tails.boum.org/blueprint/vpn_support/  You could either get a dedicated VPN router and put the Tails machine behind it:  http://www.flashrouters.com/  or you could run Tails as a guest OS in a virtual machine with your host OS running the VPN client.  If your VPN provider has a SOCKS proxy service, you can use that with Tails. I've tested PIA's SOCKS proxy with Tails and it works fine:  https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/client-support/  (Do a Ctrl+F search for ""socks"".)

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,385bsy,ziz1,0,Tue Jun 2 00:08:20 2015 UTC,One more question :) Will a sandisk cruzer flash drive be okay to use tails on?
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,385bsy,ziz1,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:05:01 2015 UTC,"Probably not:  https://tails.boum.org/support/known_issues/index.en.html#index1h2  You can get it to work, but it requires that you change a start up option at boot time. It's kind of a hassle, but not super painful.  If a normal boot hangs forever when using a Sandisk, you can try this method as a workaround:  At the Tails boot menu, hit Tab.  Type Ctrl+A to move the cursor to the beginning of the line.  Use the right arrow key to move the cursor over to the first ""i"" in ""live-media=removable"".  Hit backspace.  It should now read as ""ive-media=removable"".  Hit Enter to boot."

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3842zh,TAILSThrowing,2,Mon Jun 1 18:50:05 2015 UTC,"If you don't say anything, what can they do?  If they can't arrest you, you have nothing to gain by telling them anything about your free time.  They MAY give your money that you have in the bank back to you and tell you to go to a different bank provider. If they do, go to a different bank. No sweat.  The WORST I can see happening is that the bank tips off LE that you are buying a large number of bitcoins, and may be using them to receive drugs. Now, if your OPSEC is top notch, you'll be fine in the tech aspect but I have no idea if buying bitcoins can even get a warrant for your packages. They may just watch closely to see you slip up, like trying to sell anything. Which then that has nothing to do with Bitcoins and more to do with analog drug dealing.  My advice is to keep your OPSEC up and don't make stupid moves. Also some good advice, don't get too paranoid, you'll end up driving yourself crazy."

NDD on the clearnet is different as they have a whole manufacturing and packaging team.  Darknet may be 3 people max. Be patient."

So far this is my setup: (I'd appreciate any other helpful advise and suggests on what I can do to improve my current setup and buying strategy.)  Old Way – I used my Macbook connected to VPN (PrivateInternetAccess) with TOR.  New Way – I've installed TAILS on an USB and boot it from my Mac to run TOR. Also I setup Electrum as my wallet. I have an encrypted SD card that holds all passwords. The USB is useless without the SD card.  Future Way -- Still run TAILS from USB but use a burner laptop & cell phone.  My buying strategy – 1) Buy BTC from Coinbase. 2) Send to Electrum. 3) Send to trusted Marketplace. 4) Always use PGP. 5) Use real name/address. I have a PO Box with the UPS Store. 6) Order /r/Freebies at a 1:3 to 1:7 ratio of DN orders (to mix up the mail and not raise suspicion). 7) Make sure to use Escrow and never FE.

What I use now - TAILS on a USB, booted from my Macbook. Tor. Using a Electrum wallet that gets recycled after every 2nd transaction.   Future - Hopefully finding a throwaway laptop with NO saved data from TAILS.  Also, I exactly do what you do. Coinbase to Electrum to Marketplace. PGP Always. Real Name and Real Address. I order off Amazon A LOT, I'm talking 200 bucks a month easy, just to mix it up. Escrow only. FE is just not going to cut it because the marketplace is just full of scams now.

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,380r33,plumbbunny,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:20:02 2015 UTC,"IPv6:       Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is the most recent version of the Internet Protocol (IP), the communications protocol that provides an identification and location system for computers on networks and routes traffic across the Internet. IPv6 was developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to deal with the long-anticipated problem of IPv4 address exhaustion. IPv6 is intended to replace IPv4.  Every device on the Internet is assigned an IP address for identification and location definition. With the rapid growth of the Internet after commercialization in the 1990s, it became evident that far more addresses than the IPv4 address space has available were necessary to connect new devices in the future. By 1998, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) had formalized the successor protocol. IPv6 uses a 128-bit address, allowing 2128, or approximately 3.4×1038 addresses, or more than 7.9×1028 times as many as IPv4, which uses 32-bit addresses and provides approximately 4.3 billion addresses. The two protocols are not designed to be interoperable, complicating the transition to IPv6. However, several IPv6 transition mechanisms have been devised to permit communication between IPv4 and IPv6 hosts.  IPv6 provides other technical benefits in addition to a larger addressing space. In particular, it permits hierarchical address allocation methods that facilitate route aggregation across the Internet, and thus limit the expansion of routing tables. The use of multicast addressing is expanded and simplified, and provides additional optimization for the delivery of services. Device mobility, security, and configuration aspects have been considered in the design of the protocol.  IPv6 addresses are represented as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons, for example 2001:0db8:85a3:0042:1000:8a2e:0370:7334, but methods to abbreviate this full notation exist.

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,37whz8,ziz1,2,Sat May 30 23:59:23 2015 UTC,"No. It just means you should create a new PGP key for darknet market use and not use any key that you previously used for your regular email.  Once you generate a new key, you should upload the public key to your profile on the darknet market. If a vendor needs to send you an encrypted message for some reason, they will retrieve the public key from your profile, encrypt the message with it and send it to you via the marketplace messaging system."
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,37whz8,ziz1,1 point,Sun May 31 00:03:13 2015 UTC,"Wait, this confuses me.  To encrypt a message and send me the PGP block, they have to attach my key to it? Like, as a recipient? When they encrypt it, check marking me as a recipient would insert my public key?"
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,37whz8,radium_fire,1 point,Sun May 31 00:05:05 2015 UTC,"Wait, this confuses me.   Sorry.   To encrypt a message and send me the PGP block, they have to attach my key to it?

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,37whz8,radium_fire,1 point,Sun May 31 00:12:01 2015 UTC,"That's pretty neat. Then they just send me the PGP block?  Now, when I send them a PGP message like I do in the OP, even though I don't have a linked email account, would it still go to there email?"
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,37whz8,ziz1,1 point,Sun May 31 00:15:27 2015 UTC,"wait you're replying to an email? yeah, it would go to their email. the email associated with someone's PGP is meaningless, they're usually fake."
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,37whz8,ziz1,1 point,Sun May 31 00:35:51 2015 UTC,"No, I figured it out.   When encrypting the PGP message, I need to encrypt it with there key so they have permission to decrypt it. Then I send the PGP block over the marketplace."

Is that correct?"

If the market is under LE control they can set you up for a controlled delivery and bust you when the package arrives. You should also use Tails or encrypt your computer's hard drive so the ""someone sent you drugs to get you in trouble"" argument is plausible. If they CD you, search your computer and find evidence that you placed the order, that argument will fail in court.  You also don't want what might have happened to one of the darknet markets to involve you as well.

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,37ooec,Vadhakara,1 point,Fri May 29 06:08:49 2015 UTC,Few questions.  1.What do you mean by the ram has time to cool off?   How do you ensure your virtual operating system isn't actually saving any data? When running tails is it substantially slower?
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,37ooec,OwnTheNight209,1 point,Sun May 31 02:11:53 2015 UTC,"RAM, or Random Access Memory, is volatile memory.  What this means is that when power is no longer being applied, anything being stored in RAM should go away forever.  However, RAM has a ""cooling off"" period.  The memory is not completely wiped instantly.  It takes time to disappear.  What this means is that a team of LE with the right set up can come in, and even if you shut the machine down they can freeze your ram and save it to dump the information from later.    TAILS is not a virtual operating system.  It is a Live operating system.  A live operating system is an OS that can run from a CD, DVD, or a flash drive without accessing the host machine's hard drive.  TAILS is pre-configured to not save any data on the machine at all unless you tell it to.    TAILS runs just as quickly as any other Linux build, or windows, etc.  The Tor network, which TAILS uses to connect to the internet and the DarkNet, however, can be very slow, due to the way it works."

Correct.   for my tor browser, should i make the same settings? network settings: socks5, localhost:9150? it seems that i should, right?   If you are using the Tor Browser Bundle, those settings should already be made.   but i cannot leave those settings on my tor browser with socks5, localhost:9150 because when i reboot it, it won't connect to the network. but if i make the changes once it boots, it seems to be ok. i'm assuming that when i select ""new tor circuit for this site"" it uses the socks5 proxy?   I don't know what's happening here. You should be able to leave those settings alone and be able to start the Tor Browser without problem. Are you using the Tor Browser Bundle?   i do get quite a few terminal outputs of:   SOCKS5 error. (It is possible that the server wants authentication).) (5, 'Connection refused') Bitmessage MIGHT be having trouble connecting to the SOCKS server. timed out    am i making something of nothing?  ?should i be using socks5?  am i missing something with socks?   I get the same errors. I think that the Bitmessage app is requesting so many new connections that the Tor process starts throttling it back, resulting in those errors. It seems to work fine, though.   do i really need bitmsg to run over tor? or is it safe/secure on it's on? (of course i use pgp for message that has anything sensitive in it)   I like running it over Tor so that your ISP or other network monitors can't see that you are connecting to the bitmessage network.   also, i'm not sure why i'd need port forwarding on 8444. no firewall is configured on my linux box, and a cursory look at my router doesn't show any port restrictions.   Port forwarding won't work when Bitmessage is routed through Tor. Nobody can make a connection to your Bitmessage client when you are using it via Tor. That's why you are getting the yellow indicator.   If you decide that you want to run Bitmessage directly, you can forward port 8444 to the IP address of you Linux machine on your router so that other clients will be able to connect to you."

It is not illegal to use Tor in the United States so there is no reason for them to install and configure equipment to detect its use.  Still, if you are worried, you can connect to a VPN first and then to the Tor network. That's what I do, but more as a protection from somehow being de-anonymized through the Tor network then for protection from my ISP. Either way, you should use a VPN.

Also, do i download TAILS using TOR or on the clearnet?   Either way is fine just as long as you verify it.    Here's a method to verify the ISO. It looks a little long, but it's a very simple process:  An easy way to verify the integrity of the Tails ISO on Windows is to install the HashTab utility.  It will calculate various file hashes by selecting a file in windows explorer, right clicking on it and selecting Properties -> ""File Hashes"".  You can download HashTab from here:  http://www.majorgeeks.com/mg/getmirror/hashtab,1.html  Once the file is downloaded, right click on it and select ""Extract All"".  Hit Extract.  Double click on ""HashTab v5.x.x.x Setup"" to install it.  Run through the default installer steps.  Once it is installed, right click on the Tails ISO in the file manager and select Properties.  Click on the File Hashes tab.  Click on the blue ""Settings"" below the hash values.  Check mark ""SHA-256"".  Check mark ""Use lowercase hash values"".  Hit OK.  The SHA256 hash value should now appear at the bottom of the Hash Value screen (after a small calculation delay).  (You will need to hover your mouse over the SHA-256 line to see the complete value.)  You can right click on the SHA256 value and select Copy to copy it into the clipboard.  The latest SHA256 hash for the ISO can be found here:  https://tails.boum.org/inc/stable_i386_hash/  Also here:  https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html (Do a Ctrl-F to search for ""sha256"")  An easy way to compare the hash value from the website to the one from HashTab is to copy them into a notepad window one below the other.  If the SHA256 hashes match, the ISO file verifies as good and you are ready to install it."

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,378hh9,HUHULI909FN,2,Mon May 25 19:07:03 2015 UTC,"Just run it and you are good to go.  You don't even need to run it through Tor, although every extra bit of security helps.  It works by having every single message in the past few days be sent to every client, just like how Bitcoin sends the blockchain around to every full node.  So since every message gets sent to every user, and because all messages are encrypted, all anybody can tell is that you're running the Bitmessage client.  They don't know if you're sending any messages or if any messages are for you or anything like that.  Obviously, more security is better.  It doesn't hurt to use it through Tor, and it doesn't hurt to use PGP on top of it, but it's not necessary.  It's a good piece of software.  Fair warning:  it's hasn't been completely audited, and there are possible attacks -- like when I said nobody can tell you're sending a message, but if they ran a TON of nodes and were connected to you, they could theoretically see that you were the first to send it out and infer that you sent it, although they wouldn't who you were sending it to.  But aside from hypothetical long shots -- it's safe to use.  I would be very comfortable using it without any additional security measures.  (Although agian, the more security the better!  No reason not to use extra layers.)"

Furthermore it's difficult to say if a tumbler is safe since they don't have an open day were you can analyse their infrastructure.  Keep in mind that a tumbler doesn't provide 100% security, they just make it harder to trace your transactions. Here an interesting example.  However there are two tumblers which dominate the market (I won't name them since one can easily look it up and I don't want to advertise here). There were reports that one of the two scams selectively so some users wandered away but I'm not really sure if these claims are true since they were mostly posted with fresh throwaway accounts and without any detailed evidence. Personally I use the second main tumbler since I had no problems with it before, the fees are low and you don't have to create an account."

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,372dng,itsnotme65,1 point,Sun May 24 17:27:06 2015 UTC,"Shared send has they same goal as a tumbler: makeing your BTC transaction harder to trace. Using shared send is safer than not using any methods to cover your tracks and provides some features that tumblers don't have (let's take sharedcoin as an example):   no fees very fast transactions open source they can't run away with your coins   However tumblers also have their advantages (let's take the one that has a  measurement as its name):   operators unknown, so won't have to follow any orders from LE (e.g. subpoenas) the operators know what they're doing, i.e. they don't have to act like they're a serious company which wants to have a perfectly legal facade, they know that the majority of their users want to buy drugs with their BTC and since they're not inexperienced with anonymity and security they will do everything they can to keep third persons away from your transactions. You get brand new coins which aren't dirty Small fees: it's worse than no fees at all but 2.5% isn't that much and since I don't make huge bulk orders the loss is very small. Still rather fast: you'll get your coins in under 4 hours, since I don't really need my BTC tumbled in a few seconds it's perfectly ok for me   To sum it up: the main advantage that sharedcoin has over the mentioned tumbler is that they can't scam you. However if you've found a trustworthy tumbler, like the mentioned one (it's unlikely that they'll exit scam because they're run their business more than a year long and offer also other services which nobody would use if they would get scammed by using the tumbler service), I'd recommend to use this. But no matter how much you trust a tumbler you should always be prepared to loose your money, so it's better to tumble 3 smaller amounts of BTC after each other (once you received one you send the next smaller part to the tumbler) than one big sum at a time."

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,36wfvy,wildweeds,3,Fri May 22 18:21:47 2015 UTC,There is 100mg Kamagra dose which effects in 45 minutes and last during 4-6 hours. There is also Kamagra oral jelly which affects in 15 minutes and act during 4-6 hours. Recommended dose is 50 mg. But before taking these drugs you should consult your doctor and discuss all possible kamagra side effects.  For example:  • Headache  • Diarrhea  • Dizziness  • Stomach upset  • Flushing  • Running nose  Kamagra is 100% safe product as Viagra. The only reason that Kamagra is not yet licensed in the UK is because Pfizer the makers of Viagra hold the patent on this drug which means that neither Kamagra or any other generic version will be able to obtain a license until the patent expires.

If you use a market long enough you'll remember the address eventually.
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,36rkmu,KDDG,1 point,Thu May 21 18:49:20 2015 UTC,"Thank you for responding and for that superlist link!  I'm not sure if this answers my question, though. Like, say I have a .txt file filled with .onion links (markets and whatnot) on my desktop on my main OS (Win 7 or Ubuntu). I understand it'd make me suspicious, but that's not a crime in itself is it? As some of the subreddits don't even allow market links. Then again, many of the links can be found on the clearnet, can't they? IIRC even Wikipedia has links to some markets?  I know in the US you actually don't commit any crimes until you order whatever may be considered illegal, but apparently things are different in other countries.   if you use tails in a non-persistent mode with a strong password   Wouldn't using Tails in non-persistent mode just erase the text-file?

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,36rkmu,KDDG,1 point,Fri May 22 03:18:57 2015 UTC,"Storing links to markets is not illegal but it'll look obviously suspicious in a court case.   Then again, many of the links can be found on the clearnet, can't they?   Yes you could just search for ""market onion address"" but there's the risk that you might get a phishing link (e.g. from a fake hidden wiki). Even if it's not very likely I'd recommend to get your links from trustworthy resources like the superlist.   I know in the US you actually don't commit any crimes until you order whatever may be considered illegal, but apparently things are different in other countries.   There are indeed huge differences concerning the law between different countries but in most constitutional states you shouldn't have to face a punishment if you just receive something illegal through the mail (assuming you don't have other incriminating stuff in your house, a decent lawyer, kept your mouth shut without your lawyer and you weren't kept under surveillance so that LE can collect evidence).  However I've read stories on /r/dnm from people who live in countries where the laws are way more strict and the citizens have less rights that LE even physically harms suspects to get a confession.  Regardless where you live you should always be careful and have a decent OpSec. It can really save your ass in case shit hits the fan. It's better to take some precautions now than getting entries in your criminal record in the future (which can have a big impact on your job and whole life).   Wouldn't using Tails in non-persistent mode just erase the text-file? Unless you typo'd and meant persistent? I've already setup the standard Tails, but not the persistence volume.   Yeah you're right, I meant the persistent mode. As long as you use tails (and don't fuck up your OpSec by telling anyone that your order from dnms or similar things) you should be fine. The persistent mode may be a bit more convenient since you can save the changes you've done."

YES!!!  i've been a vendor and I've chatted with lots of vendors. decent vendors NEVER get annoyed by buyers encrypting every little thing. They totally lambast and mock buyers who don't enccrypt enough, however.   As a future yardstick, ask yourself 1) does this message contain my dox or part of my dox? 2) does the message go into ANY detail about my specific order's shipping, payment, packaging or tracking? 3) Am I messaging anything that I'd be mortified if the admins or mods read? (I know the admin of a small DN forum very well. he TOTALLY reads every PM that's unencrypted - stack of bihles. I can't believe he's the only one who does)."

I still have much more to look into Bitcoin and shit, but I read that it's advisable to have multiple wallets. What about multiple PGP key pairs, aside from the ones I've used to practice PGP? Or is that overkill?"
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,36jclr,shark127,1 point,Wed May 20 11:51:49 2015 UTC,"IMO there's no such thing when it comes to overkill in terms of security. I'd rather be paranoid than serving jail time. Although I am not involved in any illegal activities, so all of this is just for personal academic purposes. Multiple keys is highly advised. Use a primary key for provision of your subkeys and ID maintenance, never letting it access internet (machine with connection). Generate keys for signing and authentication. Use 4096 RSA with expiration. Moreover, a smartcard is also advised. I own a yubikey (planning to get the neo one too), Rpi2 works good for the air-gapped machine. With this setup you can have SSH authentication.  Now, keep in mind that the majority of DNM users do not practice any of this. It's too easy and convenient to boot tails and use the openPGP on it, which is pre-installed. For some this is all the security they need. On the other hand there are people who don't even take it this far in terms of opsec. So use your own judgement."

Nothing else that could get thru LE easier really interests me as much as it used to  It would just suck so much getting caught with something so easy to find irl especially if my work found out.

From what I can tell (about 2 years of lurking here and about a year and a half of using the markets) a controlled delivery goes down like this. Package gets delivered but you have to sign for it, you sign, you go inside, cops kick down your door within minutes. Or you sign, cops arrest you right there (there has been times that they posed as the postal worker.) Or if you used someone else's address, the cops will be sitting there waiting while your friend calls you and tells you to pick up your package, and you get arrested. Never have I seen or heard about an arrest that was strictly for receiving a package, where you actually got to possess and use your drugs.   tl;dr if your door isn't being knocked down, or cops aren't swarming you within an hour of receiving your package, history shows you're in the clear as far as police go."

If you don't sign they take it back to the post office with them. In the cases of that happening for legal clearnet orders, they'll leave you with a slip to go pick up and sign at the post office, I don't know what they do in the case of a rejected controlled delivery.

Or they can appear very professional and reliable. It's not always a con, either, there can be real affection and enjoyment, or a real effort to be a businessperson. but as legit as it feels, you have to keep reminding yourself that you're not FRIENDS in the IRL sense. The stakes are too high.  Of necessity, everyone puts their own interests first. I've seen it happen several times with ""friends"" of mine, who have tried to actually start DN businesses together with the best intentions... people will turn on you in a second if their security or money is threatened, even by a third party, or if they hear something sketchy about you. Basically on a whim, people go from reliable to invisible, bff to blackmailer. YOU CANNOT TRUST ANYONE no matter how nice and friendly they seem to be. Do not give anyone your dox ever ever ever ever ever ever. The only people on DN I can really consider friends of mine don't know anything about me and don't engage in business dealings with me.

Now that being said the chances of getting in any sort of trouble in any way for buying a legal item on a DNM is incredibly small.  The majority of times that people get busted for things is due to something being discovered in the mail and then actions are taken.

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,36bj59,darknet_noob,2,Mon May 18 01:16:09 2015 UTC,"The issues with OS X is you don't know if there's a backdoor somewhere in the system, which is why Tails (a GNU/Linux-based OS that's Free and Open Source Software) is so commonly used.  You should use it too, if at all possible. However, in your situation you might not be able to.   For full disk encryption, Apple's support page has a good guide on how to get that started. You should be using any and every available method to keep yourself safe. Encrypt your HDD/SSD, always use a VPN, use Tor Browser Bundle to access the DNMs, and always encrypt any sensitive information. Tumbling/mixing your coins is also a good idea, but some find it unnecessary.  I would even recommend being on a VPN for average non-DNM browsing activities."
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,36bj59,MLP_is_my_OPSEC,2,Mon May 18 01:25:26 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing with TAILS: this is the only way you can guarantee your info isn't being backdoor'ed to Apple HQ. Having said that though, my personal opinion is that you have nothing to worry about unless you were being actively tracked. Essentially, unless you're a big time dealer, I don't think you'll ever have to worry about that much level of secrecy. That's some Snowden type level of staying off radar. The FBI will not be summoning Apple for backdoor history for a few substances that /u/darknet_noob bought for personal use. Unless you're going to be selling or reselling on the street, I wouldn't worry about using TAILS, but that's just my opinion. If you do decide to not use TAILS, you have to take some other precautions.  One, I wouldn't use a VPN unless you have to do some clearnet stuff. For instance, if you need to use LBC with some anonymity, I would use a VPN. TOR is already anonymous (minus any spy-level backdoors from Apple), so using a VPN actually identifies you with an IP that's linked to your credit card (usually), so in that sense it's making you slightly less secure. Using TOR on a public wifi would be safer than using VPN, but even that is overkill IMO.   Definitely tumble while on TOR as a good measure. Of course PGP to send your mailing address is a must too.   If you decide to go into this on a deep level where you think LE might want to ""tail"" you on the interwebs, then I would consider doing some more hardcore protection measures."

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,36aw3j,ziz1,2,Mon May 18 07:31:37 2015 UTC,I think that GPGTools usually encrypts messages with both your public key and the recipients public key. It's normally done that way for email so that you can read items in your sent folder while still keeping them encrypted.

No. Also, don't sign your messages. Vendors don't usually import buyers PGP keys unless they need to send them some sensitive information. Signing is at best of little use and at worst will confuse a vendor when they get the scary PGP warning the your message might not be from you.   What is the best way of doing this?   Put your public key in your buyers profile. If they need to send you a message, they will look in your profile and get it from there."

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,36817c,ziz1,1 point,Sun May 17 02:20:39 2015 UTC,Just paste it. I think most markets will give you an error if you try and enter anything other than the actual ascii armored public PGP key.
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,36817c,fartboxtart,2,Sun May 17 02:23:42 2015 UTC,In my opinion doesn't hurt to include the PGP along with your message before you sign if you think they doesn't already have your Public PGP. When the vendor reads your message it'll have your PGP there for them to use just in case.

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,35rex4,swagstermcdonalds,7,Tue May 12 21:57:24 2015 UTC,"YES. On behalf of 9th grade Civics teachers everywhere, YES.   State law only governs the land that is confined within that state's borders. Federal law governs anything that crosses those state lines. That's why if you look at state laws legalizing marijuana, they legislate heavily to make sure that everything that has to do with that marijuana is kept to within their borders. If you're a licensed grower, you can get in trouble for buying fucking fertilizer outside of the state if you're going to use it to grow marijuana. Fertilizer.  So if you smoke in, say, Colorado, you're not committing a felony. But the minute you take that joint to Utah you've just committed a federal crime, because you just transported a federally controlled substance across state lines, and now the feds can charge you with a crime. It doesn't matter that you bought it in a state that has it legalized. The minute you took it across the state lines it became a federal issue. This is the whole reason that the federal government exists. It is there to govern what happens between the states, because without that power, you could have Colorado legalizing marijuana and five states around it getting pissy and legislating what are essentially trade wars between themselves. The federal government is there to literally take that worry away from the states. It's better this way, trust me. You don't want California boycotting Texas because Texas buys too many Mexican avocados.  This is disregarding the fact that is also a federal crime to transport any federally controlled substance through the United States Postal Service. You might be able to get away with it if you something private like FedEx or UPS, but the federal government owns USPS and they get to decide what is sent through it, as well as what is illegal to send through it, no matter if that product crosses state lines or not."
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,35rex4,MauldotheLastCrafter,2,Tue May 12 23:01:44 2015 UTC,"This answer is only marginally educated and not researched:  Technically anything to do with marijuana is against the law federally.  What constitutes a felony, I'm not sure.  What I do know is that crossing any sort of state lines is a no-no.  Also, you have to be within the law in your state.  So, if the person happens to be in your state, they have to follow all of laws as well as you.  Finally, I'm not sure about what the law has to say about using the postal service.  aka Colorado has legalized, the USPS is a federal entity.  Can I send it legally to another resident of Colorado through the USPS?  There are all sorts of issues here.  Short answer, while it may not be a felony, it's probably not cool."
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,35rex4,Theevildrpat,1 point,Tue May 12 22:06:39 2015 UTC,"Actually, whether it be interstate or not, using the US postal system for transporting drugs is a felony offense. So YES, it is a felony."

Even though the product being sold is legal, we are well aware that much of the volume of transactions and cash flow on the markets stems from trafficking narcotics, so conducting any business, even otherwise legal business via a DNM is equivalent to helping run the market or backing it financially. that's a felony. not sayin you'd ever be charged, that would be a bit ridiculous."

With certain kinds of remote management software, they can access their devices remotely, but it usually depends on hooks in the OS to monitor the system that Tails would not have.

I actually don't know for sure about what market is exactly the second biggest. You can use grams to search for products, most reputable vendors have vendor accounts there and you'll be able to see vendors who operate on multiple markets.  For alternatives see here. Watch the Market Warnings.  I personally like Blackbank because it's been running for a long time, it has multisig, and there are some long time vendors on there.   Also if you order internationally be aware that shipping can be erratic, even with great stealth, so if you're in need of lightning fast product make sure to buy domestic"

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,35l1of,silvermirror2,4,Mon May 11 11:05:13 2015 UTC,"The process might be a precautionary tool against scams for the coin vendors. How to get past it? Simple, choose a seller which doesn't require to do so.  You might also consider the fact that part of the sellers on LBC are LE agents with the purpose of tracking/monitoring the traffic of coins. Bank account info + photo ID is like a gold mine for any one trying to catch you slipping or just doxing in general."
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,35l1of,shark127,1 point,Mon May 11 11:23:39 2015 UTC,Awesome. When signing up to LBC do i use my real details and then just tumble my coins?
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,35l1of,shark127,4,Mon May 11 11:31:29 2015 UTC,"Well signing up fro LBC only requires your email, so there's no need to include your real details. You can create a clean email address just for that. Furthermore, you can use different methods of paying depending on the vendors requirements. Popular ones are paypal, okpay, perfect money, moneygram etc. So you should look into how much of your info is given on those different systems. There are even sellers who have ridiculous prerequisites like having at least a 1y/o facebook account, photo ID, etc. Consider creating fresh and clean accounts for all the requirements if you can. Wouldn't recommend using a fake ID due to the fact that although it creates an extra layer of protection, it also comes with more risks. Like if you get busted, you'll get a nice big pile of complimentary charges which which will absolutely result in you eating https://i.imgur.com/CvwjIkE.gif.  So yea, definitely tumble your coins afterwards. But my personal preference is always cash -> coins. Terminates all the unnecessary privacy issues and saves you the hassle."

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,35ja0r,sivart13g,7,Sun May 10 22:35:03 2015 UTC,"Well the biggest risk is probably having your life destroyed in one way or another (going to jail, getting killed, etc.). Do your research, don't just trust what a random stranger on the internet says. Also, you should be very careful with this part:   I just want to purchase a few recreational drugs for me and my friends   I suggest keeping the whole operation as much under the radar as possible. Numerous scenarios where you get in trouble over having a big mouth or generous intent. Imagine on of your buddies getting caught with some drugs, being threatened jail time, and snitching on you. Or some one getting jealous of your supply and again getting you into trouble. It's not worth it."

One you risk your package getting caught by customs and then possibly going to jail if they find proof that you ordered the drugs, if you hide everything on a flash drive encrypted and then have nothing on your computer you should be good. This also includes making sure that you mix your bitcoins so they can't be traced back to your name/account/computer. I recommend installing Tails and booting off a flash drive and storing everything else on a separate flash drive.   There are other ways to get caught like people snitching on you that you are ordering, LE vendor accounts, fake market url's that LE has control of, and not being smart. Play it out slow and make sure you do everything correct, like using a vpn, ENCRYPTION, shit like that. I recommend getting a fake id and getting a po box and sending your stuff there. Order blotters of any kind first to get over the fear of getting caught.  Good luck"

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,35ja0r,TripAddict,3,Mon May 11 01:06:54 2015 UTC,"That is true. Now that I think about it, it's not worth the extra risk shipping the package to your fake ID's P.O. box, unless you know a very efficient, next to fool-proof way to do it in your state. Yes if you get caught you get to sing a little longer in your cell, but if the method undoubtedly gives you extra security - go for it. Like you said TripAddict - maybe the process will give you extra time, or even create some legislative loops which will decrease/remove the charge if done correctly, I'm not a lawyer though, and state/country legal systems differ.  Anyways, taking into account OP's desire to obtain a small amount of substances without the intent to redistribute the best way would be a  home address with real name IMO."

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,35ig1n,radium_fire,1 point,Tue May 12 02:29:27 2015 UTC,"Wow, excellent point. if everyone was lighting themselves on fire? would that be ok with you? Just because behavior is common, doesn't mean it's a good idea.  There's a reason there's a drinking age, it's because the average underage kid just lacks the capacity to appreciate the long term consequences of their behavior. It's just a fact, no matter your IQ or how smart you are, you're not WISE. Your thinking process isn't mature yet. You don't have the psychological capacity to make a reasoned decision about alcohol, drugs, sex, etc. You have no life experience. I hate sounding like parents, but it's just fucking true. I hate to see kids with everything ahead of them pull all these dumb moves out here and risk ruining their chances at everything they could have in the future.   I know this because I have been a teenager with a fake ID. I remember how I felt and how I thought. I was intelligent and sensible, compared to other kids. I could totally handle everything. Yet OMG when I think of the shit I did, the risks I took, I'm lucky to be alive, much less have avoided arrest and prosecution. In retrospect, I was an utter moron with no sense of responsibility and no concept of consequences more serious than detention or getting grounded. I couldn't see the link between my behavior in the moment and my future years away.  I'm lucky there was no darknet when I was a childish fool, I'm sure I would've screwed up my life big time.  I couldn't live with myself if I were a bartender selling beer to a teenager who then goes and wraps his car and his girlfriend around a tree. I'm horrified at the thought of vending to that kid too - he could be dumb enough to OD, wreck the car, or get busted - and in the process, if I'm not scrupulous with opsec, get ME busted. No vendor worth his salt will knowingly transact with a 17yo. Even if the vendor gives no shit about the kid, it's way too risky for us. There's enough risk and uncertainty on DNM's without children darting around.   So get out of here."

If i were op i would pester the shit out of vendor to tell me what the tracking said, no seriously dude is my address fucked up now,  refund me and/or I'm reporting to the admin. you shouldn't be left sitting there wondering, that's shitty behavior on the vendor's part..    In the event the vendor continues to remain mute, and in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, I would assume that you got scammed. he's avoiding you, and  previous orders went ok, so you know you didn't screw up your address, and if your address is correct and stealth is decent (not profile-able), it's vanishingly rare to have a domestic package ""intercepted."" ""lost"" is also rare but less so. that's where the tracking is key."
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,35frq3,radium_fire,1 point,Sun May 10 03:26:52 2015 UTC,"Minus the vendor possibly scamming, this has been something that has been running through my mind; what happens if you get a love letter OR your package never comes... ever... Do you accept the fact that your address and possibly name have been flagged by usps and LE and move on, or are there alternatives.  Honestly OP I think you were scammed and don't have to worry about LE. If you're that scared, maybe use a burner address? Idk man this is probably the worst part about DNM. You can't just call the post office like any other package and see if anything is even coming to you. Oh well... OP I think you're safe UNLESS you were buying a crap ton in which case you might have cause for concern.  In my crappy honest opinion, if you got the real life sources, go back to them and don't risk it."

FWIW I chose regular airmail and LL are therefore saying they won't reship which sucks. Especially given that they claim that 2-5% of their airmail goes missing.

Just make sure to write down your seed words, because your bitcoin wallet will need to be re-created every time you boot Tails if you do not have persistence.

I believe that you could simplify it to the following and still be safe:  LocalBitcoin >  dnwallet > tumble > DNM  Transfer the minimum amount that you can tumble, at first, to test your procedure. Watch out for darknet markets that change your deposit address."

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,356cv5,rainrainthrowaway133,1 point,Thu May 7 14:03:52 2015 UTC,Sorry this is unrelated but does this mean that I can't use the Electrum wallet provided for marketplaces?  Just curious... I thought Standard Electrum would work fine for escrow.
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,356cv5,gna527,1 point,Thu May 7 14:57:22 2015 UTC,"Based on the comments from this guide, https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/2znvmi/guide_multisignature_transactions_with_electrum_20/.  Standard Electrum does work fine for escrow. I think the way Multi-sig works is that it incorporates a third party(marketplace) which makes the transactions less risky to both vendor/buyer."
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,356cv5,hksupport,1 point,Thu May 7 16:08:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, multisig stands for ""multiple signatures"".  A multisig address requires more than one person to sign the bitcoin transaction in order to spend the funds sent to it.  For example a 2-of-3 multisig address would require any two out of three people to sign off on spending its money.  So if you had a buyer, seller, and market as the three parties, then any two of those three could decide how to spend the money.  The buyer and seller like it because the market isn't holding the money and can't just run off with it, and in the case of a dispute, the market can choose to side with either the buyer or seller and resolve the situation, again, without every actually having control of the money.  Everybody is better protected."
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,356cv5,hksupport,1 point,Thu May 7 20:38:14 2015 UTC,"The reason you're having trouble is because what Electrum is asking for is what's known as a BIP32 HD master public key, NOT a bitcoin public key.  The vendor and marketplace would need to both have one, which practically speaking, means they would both have to be using Electrum.  The guide you are using assumes that everybody involved is using Electrum.  There is currently no good application to manually do multisig the way you want, however I and some friends are working on one right now and expect to be finished relatively soon.  You are right to want to use multisig, and it is truly a shame that there are so few ways for normal people to do multisig in an easy manner.  In the mean time, I'd be happy to help you as best I can.  Can you provide any details or specifics on what you'd like to do?  You can give fake keys or X out other information and I can still probably get you going."

Just stumbled over another local seller who sells 'em for as little as the ""spot price of BitFinex"" plus a single percent (!), supposedly just to cover Localbitcoins' own fee. Sounds great of course, but the dude only has five trades so far. Not sure what to do, here..."
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,355qgi,CosmoKev,2,Thu May 7 10:45:06 2015 UTC,I would go with reputable sellers if possible. But all sellers started from the bottom with little to no transactions. Use caution and trust your gut.
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,355x42,hotpocket12,3,Thu May 7 11:20:39 2015 UTC,"You aren't supposed to have to do anything before you eat it.   Either you got bad stuff, which could mean either the vendor scammed you or just had a bad batch, or you could be not doing a large enough dose at once.  Dosage is the big problem with edibles. Some people's edibles are much stronger than others. Did the product you bought indicate how much THC was in each piece or chocolate, or anything like that?  Did you buy from a long-time vendor with a lot of positive experience? Either way I would message the vendor and ask how much THC is in the product you bought, or what he suggests as the recommended dose.  On another note, you mentioned that you have never tried weed before, many people do not get high the first one or two they use it! If you are using the recommend dosage, I would suggest trying it two or three more times to see if it starts working. It's quite possible that the you won't get high until the third or fourth time.  Please DO NOT increase the dosage too much. Try the recommend amount two or three more times. Consuming too much THC via edibles can cause extremely bad paranoia even for the most experienced stoner.  Keep trying mate. If your batch turns out to be bad, try another vendor. Trust me, it will be worth it!"
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,355x42,DarknetWiki,2,Thu May 7 11:41:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah it did say the THC content in the description but I can't remember it off the top of my head, also said the recommended amount in the description as 1 for people with no tolerance.  It was a well known vendor too, so I'm hoping its a bad batch/I'm not used to it yet. I have 3 pieces left so I'll try it a few more times, then message the vendor."
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,355x42,DarknetWiki,1 point,Thu May 7 11:48:02 2015 UTC,"Okay, please let us know what happens. I suspect it is the situation where you're not getting high the first couple times.   Get ready for a great time when it finally hits you, and have fun!"

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,352hf7,gna527,1 point,Wed May 6 17:44:13 2015 UTC,"Well my USB wouldn't let me set up persistance (you can only do this on a USB where TAILS was installed by TAILS installer... I used Rufus) so I had to encrypt a partition of a second USB, which was simple to do (I would link to the guide I used but I'm on mobile, just Google how to set up an encrypted partition in TAILS) and it means that each time I boot TAILS I just type a password in to access the encrypted partition where I have my Electrum wallet and PGP key saved."
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,352hf7,gna527,1 point,Wed May 6 20:22:27 2015 UTC,"Ok.  So I have been saving PGP to a second USB, unpartitioned.  When I started Electrum it gave me a seed to save, which I memorized.  I also saved the ""wallet"" on the unencrypted USB but I am not entirely sure what this did.  I have not tested sending any BTC to it yet.  I boot TAILS from a DVD. Should I read up on how to encrypt a partition in a second USB?  Is what I've saved useable?  The PGP keys seem to work, I haven't tested Electrum.  Thanks for your help and patience!"
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,352hf7,gna527,1 point,Wed May 6 22:21:27 2015 UTC,"You memorised your seed? I'd suggest having a paper copy somewhere, mine is on a post-it note on the wall behind my monitor. What you've saved is useable, once you've created the encrypted partition you'll be able to drag and drop into it like any other folder. I tested Electrum and the DNM wallet by transferring 0.001 BTC or something like that, then when I saw that appear in my DNM wallet I transferred the full amount.   Thanks for your help and patience!   Lol, I had no idea about any of the technical stuff until last week so don't worry about that."
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,352hf7,gna527,1 point,Wed May 6 23:25:13 2015 UTC,"Haha well I appreciate it anyway. If you don't mind my asking, have you had any success so far?

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,352hf7,jreyes1104,1 point,Thu May 7 07:59:50 2015 UTC,"That was the step I spent a few days pondering over...  What I decided to do in the end was purchase BTC on localbitcoins using a bank transfer. You send the money using your online banking, if you have it, and they send the BTC to your localbitcoins account once they receive the funds. Through this process there is also a live chat available with the seller in case you have questions.  From there I sent it straight to my Electrum wallet and then to my DNM account (I did a test of 0.001 BTC first to see it was all working).  Good luck, you're so close!!"

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,352hf7,Trancefuzion,1 point,Thu May 7 10:20:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah that is true. On your bank statement it doesn't say anything to do with Bitcoins though, just the name of the reference you are given when you purchase. It's up to you. I mean, I mentioned in the original post if I had done anything wrong and so far nobody has criticised the fact I bought them with my real ID so maybe it's a valid option."

Reddit has already been subpoenaed for the user data for some users from the DNM sub. Even though if you are someone who is just a buyer or tiny vendor, you are not likely to get that kind of heat, there is still no reason to leave a big trail right back to your house.

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,353eld,MitalikaSucks,2,Wed May 6 19:48:27 2015 UTC,"The answer to your question really lies in the people you FB chat with...   Most people don't know how to encrypt or decrypt a message...nor do they want to take the time to learn. If a DNM or a Vendor becomes compromised (LE take down)...and your public key is located anywhere DNM related (profile, transaction, message) and you have the same public key on your FB profile (LE publicly admits they use social media to gather evidence)...it is easy to match your true identity to your ""anonymous"" identity. No bueno...   ** Note that if you ever plan on doing this...I would advise you keep two seperate keys. One for FB and one for DNM.  ** Talking about drugs on FB chat isn't that big of a deal. Always keep in mind all FB activity is logged and kept for life...talking about drug transactions you were just involved in on FB isn't smart."

Once you get the confirmation of your logon, close the unsafe browser. Wait a few min for Tor.   If it's not a captive portal wifi like that, and you're successfully connecting to your network, how long are you waiting for Tor to be ready? For me it has occasionally taken as much as 7-10 min.

I always have two sticks going, one for work and one for home, and keep the persistence frequently backed up from one to the other. when one becomes nonfunctional I sitll have pretty recent stuff on the other one. I usually lose a couple keys because I'm never fully backedc up, but that's nothing. I just make a new stick and use Nautilus and Tails' disc utility to make a clone of the persistence volume.

It's an entirely separate OS, so you know you won't get information mixed up or that other applications can read compromising data.  Encrypt your Android phone, and get the (root required) app CryptFS to change the disk encryption password to a longer one.  In fact, it's good practice to encrypt all your computers.

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,34xdt9,ziz1,1 point,Wed May 6 02:47:28 2015 UTC,"Okay, since you are using STARTTLS, it a false positive warning from Tails. Whenever you make a connection to port 110, which was mostly used for unencrypted POP3, Tails, out of an abundance of caution, warns you that you might be exposing your unencrypted email to the network and / or a bad exit node. With STARTTLS, you actually switch to an encrypted connection, so it is not a concern in your case. You might try using port 995 instead of 110 because it was specifically designed for POP3 over SSL (POP3S) to avoid the (now annoying) warning. I checked and their email server is listening on port 995 as well.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STARTTLS"

Aside from the existing real concerns that mainstream OSs are open to security services, and assuming you are a small time customer ...   You order something illegal and it is delivered to your neighbor by mistake. Little Johnny opens it and is rushed to hospital, state/national police suspect you for one reason or another and break down your door. Moral questions aside, it would be beneficial for you if there was no evidence of anything illegal in your apartment.   You have no illegal drugs, no paraphernalia, kudos. Maybe you chose your encryption with plausible deniability as a requirement, I don't know. But if you own encrypted partitions and you refuse to unlock them, that is a crime in some places. Maybe worse than personal use of illegal drugs.   TAILS stores nothing. Sites you visited, passwords, all in your head with no evidence they existed ... there is no information for an adversary to use against you, no evidence you have done anything illegal.   Better if you can open everything to LE, let them wring you out, and find nothing. Through your legal advisor, of course.

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,34tqu5,Tiaranu,2,Mon May 4 22:08:30 2015 UTC,"You are welcome. Instructions on TAILS website are better than me, you burn a DVD from TAILS website in OSX and press a special key on your Mac when you reboot to boot from it. If you prefer USB TAILS, there is an option when running DVD TAILS to format one. There are other ways. I could be full of it, I don't use Macs.  TAILS isn't perfect and is under attack. Be careful what you download, keep on top of alerts and use latest version. Keep reading around; there are ways to screw up even with TAILS.

Assume you will make mistakes, and minimize consequences.   The link you go to might be a phishing link. Your implementation of TOR may be booby-trapped to javascript your location to an adversary. Law Enforcement may be running the market and you might not use PGP. You may use LE's PGP keys. The post man might deliver a pound of heroin to your God-fearing Christian neighbor with your name on it. A post man might become suspicious that a package without your name on it is for your mail box and fits a suspicious profile. Your wife lets law enforcement in to your home because she was robbed and for whatever reason they want you to unlock this encrypted USB stick they found in your cat's anus.   Think things through. Pretend you ordered heroin and the postman sprayed it all over your front door and called the police. You are in hand-cuffs now. They are in your house. They have torn your workplace apart. They have an evidence bag full of your encrypted hard disks and USB sticks on the steel table in front of you. What are the passwords. What's in your house. What's on your hard drive. What do you say to the officer who is promising the Earth if you just sign this, or face 30 years in prison, three hundres miles from your home?   You know, there are ways of conducting yourself so that there is nothing to find, nothing to arouse suspicion. At least as far as state/national police are concerned. But you have to assume you will lose any money you send, and you will be incarcerated according to the law of the land for whatever crime you are committing.   Many people find DNMs a God Send. Suddenly they don't need to chance being poisoned by the streets, or being robbed on the way home. On the other hand, maybe you cannot see your kid for 2 years because you are dumb. IDK, be smart, may be read a bit more, think with hindsight, good luck.   You didn't mention TAILS. TAILS is easy compared to other required skills, stupid not to have it."

If LE wanted to hunt you down bad enough, say they somehow found a way to obtain your IP address and/or monitor your traffic (e.g. controlling enough exit nodes), couldn't they just determine your location via IP, along with the time you committed certain transactions online, and then request the security footage from that particular Starbucks at that exact hour and location to catch their suspect?

Getting to a specific city is easy, but from there you have to ask the network provider what customer had that IP at that time (or if you have access to federal government homeland security data, just look it up). If that customer is a VPN provider then you have to get more records, assuming they keep the logs.  Once you are down to a specific business address, say a Starbucks, you have to find out if they have cameras, and how long they keep video (having and managing storage costs money, many security systems only store a day or two, or maybe a week, if the place gets robbed, they save off the relevant few minutes before it gets over-written).  So you might know where a connection was made from, but it's hard to link that to a specific person, unless they were dumb and leaked enough information to identify them via browser fingerprinting or something like that.  Also the person who is using the WiFi connection may not be inside the store where they would appear on the video, which usually covers the places where the money is kept, not the tables and parking lot."

You need to write down your Electrum seed words, or somehow save them in a place separate from the USB. If you have your seed words, you can recreated your bitcoin wallet at any time.  If you are using persistence on Tails, and have enabled ""Bitcoin Client"" in the persistence configuration tool (Applications > Tails > Configure persistent volume), then your wallet will be saved to the USB and you do not need to enter your seed words to recreate your wallet every time you boot Tails up. You should still keep your seed words saved in a separate location in case your USB drive fails (an unfortunately common enough occurrence) or is lost.  https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/persistence/configure/index.en.html     I also downloaded gpg4usb ... I've noticed there is a OpenPGP encryption applet on tails, can I just use that instead of the one I downloaded?   Yes.

Does the vendor need my public key to decrypt my messages?   No. They use their private key to decrypt messages that have been encrypted with their public key.

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,34k38d,Jobless_Junkie,3,Fri May 1 20:57:08 2015 UTC,"I know you should use VPN>Tor if you don't want your ISP knowing your using Tor. But I also heard that using it that way is bad for your OPSEC (I don't remember exactly why/how.)    If you want an extra margin of safety, you should use a VPN to connect to the Tor network. If you are somehow de-anonymized through the Tor network (like the FBI / CERT did in Operation Onymous) instead of getting your IP address, they would have the exit IP of your VPN instead.   https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-security-advisory-relay-early-traffic-confirmation-attack  One of the arguments against using a VPN to connect to the Tor network is that it would form a sort of ""permanent entry guard"". After Operation Onymous, it was decide by the Tor Project that the safest way forward was to fix the bug exploited by CERT and to move to using only one guard node instead of three, so Tor currently uses a ""permanent entry guard"" type setup.  https://blog.torproject.org/category/tags/entry-guards  Roger Dingledine, Project Lead at the Tor Project has stated that using a VPN to access the Tor network is not a bad idea:  https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-January/022917.html     Why would you need Tor>VPN?   To obscure the fact that you are connecting via the Tor network from the target machine. Because of abuse from the Tor network, many sites block either Tor exit nodes or all Tor relays, so the only way to connect to them via the Tor network is to use a proxy or VPN after Tor.  For darknet market purposes, you cannot use a VPN after the Tor network, because when accessing a hidden onion service you do not exit the Tor network.     What do bridges do and in what case should you use them?   Bridges are permanent entry guards, but unlike a normal entry guard are not publicly listed. They are often suggested as a replacement for a VPN, but since they are part of the Tor network, they will not protect you against de-anonymization through the Tor network like a VPN would. Just like a normal Tor relay, anybody can run a bridge, and if you pick a bridge run by the bad guys (CERT, FBI, etc.), you could be in bad shape if they've found a new de-anonymization technique.  Since the IP address of bridges are not publicly listed, persons behind restrictive ISPs can use them to access the Tor network if the ISP is blocking the IP addresses of all of the publicly listed Tor relays."

You can fix the problem with needing to delete the 2s every time you boot, though.    Here's a procedure to modify the boot up configuration file to make the change semi-permanent:    Since I don't have a C720, I can't fully test this. You should do this on a scratch Tails USB with no persistence, or you should make a backup of your Tails USB with persistence using this program before proceeding:   http://www.alexpage.de/usb-image-tool/download/  Making a mistake in this procedure could render your Tails USB unbootable.    Insert the Tails USB drive into your machine and power it on.  At the Tails boot screen, hit Tab.  Hit Ctrl+A to go to the beginning of the line.  Use the right arrow key to get over to the two ""2""s and delete them.  Hit enter to boot.  Select Yes in the greeter for more options and hit Forward.  Assign an administration password and hit Login.  Start a command line terminal (hit the square black box on the top menu bar) and type this command:  sudo su   Type the password you entered earlier for administration (it won't show on the screen) and hit enter.  Type this command:  mount -o remount -w /lib/live/mount/medium  cd /lib/live/mount/medium   Depending on how your USB was created (with the Tails installer or other USB installer), you will either have a ""syslinux"" or an ""isolinux"" directory here. This next command should cd you into whichever one exists, but will give an error that the other doesn't exist. Ignore the error.  cd syslinux; cd isolinux   The prompt should now read either:  root@amnesia:/lib/live/mount/medium/syslinux#  or  root@amnesia:/lib/live/mount/medium/isolinux#  Once you are in either the syslinux or isolinux sub-directory, you will edit the file ""liveamd64.cfg"" to modify the boot settings:  gedit liveamd64.cfg   (You will get some errors from gedit. They are safe to ignore.)  Under the ""label live"", delete the 2s from ""vmlinuz2"" and ""initrd2.img"" to make them ""vmlinuz"" and ""initrd.img"".   Do File > Save then File > Quit  Reboot Tails.  You should be good to go.    Although I can' test this on a C720, I have tested this on a 64 bit machine that runs the live-amd64.cfg script and it works when the machine is booted in legacy mode. If the C720 is booting in UEFI mode, you will have to modify this file instead: /lib/live/mount/medium/EFI/BOOT/liveamd64.cfg"

Under ""Name"" there should be a key listed as ""Tails developers (offline long-term identity key)"".  Right click on that key and select ""Certificate Details"".  Make sure the key fingerprint is as follows  Key fingerprint = A490 D0F4 D311 A415 3E2B  B7CA DBB8 02B2 58AC D84F  Once you have verified the key fingerprint, right click on the key again and select ""Certify Certificate"".  Check mark the Tails key.  Check mark ""I have verified the fingerprint"".  Hit Next.  Select which of your keys you want to sign it with.  Select ""Certify for myself"".  Hit ""Certify"".  Enter the passphrase for your key.  Hit Finish.  Right click on the Tails key again and select ""Change Owner Trust"".  Select ""I believe checks are very accurate"".    Select File > Decrypt/Verify Files  Locate and select the signature file for the ISO (tails-i386-1.3.2.iso.sig).  Hit Open.  Make sure that the ISO file is listed in the Signed data box (tails-i386-1.3.2.iso).  Hit Decrypt/Verify.  You should get the green ""Signature is valid."" message.  If you do, the ISO is verified as good and you are ready to install it."

Yes.  Coinbase in particular tracks and cracks down on people getting deposits from, and withdrawing to, things they don't like.  That said, your Ag deposit address is likely unique, so you probably won't have a problem, but it's still only a maybe at best.  You should at the very least use an intermediate wallet between Coinbase and your market, and it is recommended to tumble or use more than one intermediary wallet, so you at least have some semblence of removing your IRL identity attached to Coinbase with your use of darknet markets.

If you used the official Tails Installer to install Tails to the USB (Applications > Tails > Tails Installer) you should be able to create a persistent partition on it. If you used the Universal USB Installer (UUI), Rufus or another USB installer, you will need to create a 2nd Tails USB by running the Tails installer from the 1st to install Tails to the 2nd. Once you boot from the 2nd Tails installed Tails USB, you will be able to create a persistent partition.    Creating a persistent partition. (Applications > Tails > Configure persistent partition)  When you create the persistent partition, I recommend that you enable all of the options. You may want to use more of them in the future and if they are enabled now, you won't have to reboot to enable them later. At a minimum, you should enable Personal Data (the Persistent folder in your home directory for general file storage), GnuPG (for PGP key storage), Network Connections (to save your WiFi passwords) and Bitcoin Client (for the Electrum Bitcoin wallet).

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,34caok,dnmhelp-,1 point,Thu Apr 30 03:18:00 2015 UTC,"It's good practice to use different usernames and different passwords at different sites.  At the very least, different passwords.  That way, if one site is compromised or your password is stolen some other way, it is only good at one site rather than at every site.  Imagine a market goes bad and starts just recording user login info.  You wouldn't know about it.  Then they just use that login info on other markets and withdraw your money or do something else damaging.  You wouldn't even think it had anything to do with the evil market, because all the problems seem to occur on the other market.  That can't happen if you use a different password.  If you have trouble remembering different (and difficult) passwords, look into what's called a password manager.  That's a secure program which stores all your passwords.  And then you only have to remember the one password to unlock it.  Obviously, that presents its own risks - if somebody gets access to it, they have all your passwords.  But if you can keep that one program secure, then all your other passwords will be nice and secure too.  You have have different random 30+ character passwords (very secure!) for every site now.  Tails comes with a program called KeePassX which is a password manager that is interoperable with the open source program KeePass version 1."

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,34cb9t,heliroll,2,Thu Apr 30 00:29:18 2015 UTC,"First off it's important to understand how Electrum works. This is a simplification of how it works.   When you generate a wallet you essentially create a master key. This master key is then used to generate wallet addresses. If you go to the receive tab in Electrum you can see that there are multiple receive addresses. Without the password to this master key, you cannot control the funds in any of the receive addresses. When you use one receive address, another one is generated and replaces it. Receive addresses should only be used once per transaction, but they are all controlled in the same wallet. These aren't linked in the blockchain."

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,34cb9t,HereWeGooo21,1 point,Thu Apr 30 01:25:19 2015 UTC,"It might be a good idea. If an exchange is linked to your real identity, sending straight to a darknet wallet would be bad OPSEC. If you're using an exchange that offers anonymous purchases like LocalBitcoins, you'll be golden. Exchanges like Coinbase and Circle require your account to be linked to a real identity.    Here's an example:  Exchange > Wallet1 *> Wallet2 *> Market  Wallet1 would be clearnet, Wallet2 would be darknet. It's important that the clearnet wallet never touches the darknet, and vice versa. Steps marked by an asterisk can have a tumbling step shoved in there if you wish, but the above should be good enough even when using Coinbase or Circle. It provides plausible deniability, and no buyer has been busted from blockchain analysis as far as I'm aware."

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,34aohm,ziz1,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:28:46 2015 UTC,"Bitmessage is fine to be used on its own.  Of course if the data it sends and receives is at all indentifying, may leak to your ISP that you're using Bitmessage, but supposedly all the data is encrypted and everybody relays messages and downloads the whole message chain, so your ISP wouldn't be able to tell anything more than you're using it.  But adding extra layers, like VPNs or proxying Bitmessage through Tor, is of course always good.  It never hurts to add more layers of security.  Better too paranoid than not paranoid enough.  Personally, I think it's probably fine to use it without any other percautions - it's just a messaging program after all.

If you ever feel unsure about how something works, post questions here! Don't order while not knowing how the stuff that is keeping you from jail works!!!  Understand what Tails does and what TOR is/does Understand at a minimum that  bitcoin is not anonymous and also learn what blockchain is. Learn about tumbling Learn about GPG   GPG will allow you to transmit your Name and Address to the seller  so that it is encrypted and only they can decrypt it and read it. You do this by using the sellers public key, available on his seller page, and use it to encrypt your messages to him. If you want the seller to be able to respond back to you then you will have to include your PGP Public key, so he can encrypt a message that only you can read.   Go here and pratice - http://www.reddit.com/r/GPGpractice  Start a thread, post your public key and someone will send you a message and include their public key. Never send your private key! This is used to read your messages!   Another tip: Don't post on here what you were going to buying!

You need to understand the difference between MBR and UEFI bios and you could make your Windows unbootable. There's also no reason to install Tails to the harddrive and save possibly incriminating evidence to your computer. By using the Live USB nothing is saved, it is all ran in your RAM, which deletes when you power off.   Download the .iso for tails, verify the image using the gpg key (don't skip this step), plug in the usb and reboot your pc. You should boot into the Tails Live USB. If your computer does not then you may need to go into your BIOS and change the boot priority so that the USB stick boots first.   It's good to learn how to verify the .iso for two reasons. First, to know that the .iso has not been modified by anyone malicious like hackers or a law enforcement angency. Two, so that you learn how to use GPG to enhance your privacy and reduce overall risk.   I don't understand tumbling coins that well either so I would just recommended reading the sidebar and then posting questions are you get stuck."

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,347i87,koo2,1 point,Wed Apr 29 00:38:07 2015 UTC,Basically the only thing this in between wallet provides is plausible deniability (for LE purposes) and not directly linking you to a tumbler/darknet (for Coinbase TOS purposes)?

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,347i87,koo2,2,Wed Apr 29 00:49:19 2015 UTC,"Yep. It provides plausible deniability and doesn't link you directly to a tumbler, since you can say you sold the BTC and the buyer gave you that address.  Exchanging for alt currencies is more work than it's worth, and you'll be paying a decent amount in fees while doing this. If LE really wants to get you, they will.

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,347i87,thisismyDNMthrowaway,2,Wed Apr 29 02:13:35 2015 UTC,"Yes every wallet is identified by an address so a wallet refers to the address.  Each wallet has a unique address, which is just a long string of characters. Looks something like Zdvndvjswejb24tougw. Each one of the wallets would have a different wallet address. You can use Electrum to make more than one wallet. As far as I know, you need to go to the TOR options and click Change Identity first so that you don't login two wallets from the same tor identity."

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,347i87,thisismyDNMthrowaway,1 point,Wed Apr 29 02:25:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not 100% on this stuff as I'm learning too. I think the proper way to do it is to setup a wallet from Electrum. Then when you are finished using this wallet, close the wallet out, then go into the TOR options and click on Change identity. This way when you make the second Electrum wallet they don't become leaked through your TOR identity. Someone should probably confirm this for us though."

And if I have any leftover coins in the market, do I transfer those back to Electrum tails wallet?   Not in the above situation, because that connects your DNM wallet, with your Electrum wallet which defeats the whole purpose of tumbling. If you wanted to send the leftover coins back to an electrum wallet then I would stick to the first/OP method, as the second electrum wallet(the one on tails) downstream the tumbling and theres nothing connecting it to you.     What I would do if I were you:  Coinbase -> Electrum #1 -> Tumble -> Market -> leftover coins -> Electrum #2     What I would do if I were me:  Coinbase -> Electrum #1 -> Electrum #2 -> Electrum #3 -> Market -> leftover coins -> Electrum #4  OR  LBTC -> Market -> Electrum"

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,343r31,KDDG,2,Tue Apr 28 01:47:33 2015 UTC,"Is there any sort of blockchain record that shows Bitcoin wallet x transferred $100 to Litecoin wallet x?   Let's say you bought 1 BTC over Localbitcoins and the 1 BTC is in the wallet BTC-A. Then you go to an exchange and trade with someone offering Litecoins. You send said person (let's call him Bob) your 1 BTC and he sends your 2 LTC (this isn't the real exchange rate but it's suitable for an example). Bob receives the 1 BTC in a wallet BTC-B, which is not tied to your identity.  So everyone who checks the blockchain, sees that 1 BTC was transferred from wallet BTC-A to BTC-B, but they don't know in which relation the two wallets are. That means you could have send your 1 BTC to a tumbler wallet or a friends wallet or ...  Meanwhile you receive 2 LTC from Bob (who owns the wallet LTC-B) to your LTC address LTC-A. This transaction also doesn't reveal why it was made and is completely unrelated with other transactions in other currencies (e.g. your BTC-A to BTC-B transaction for paying Bobs 2 LTC).  So only if someone would keep you or Bob under surveillance, he would be able to know that you exchanged BTC to LTC. The blockchains of BTC and LTC only show transactions between the same currencies (only BTC to BTC or LTC to LTC transactions).   From there are they clean enough? Am I then sending these litecoins to another exchange site and converting those to doge? Is there any chain history for this?   One BTC -> LTC exchange would be enough to remove your traces, especially if your just a normal buyer. It's maybe a bit too laborious to exit the BTC blockchain since a normal BTC tumbler would also provide a decent level of safety. However the Bitcoins from the evo exit scam were, at least partly, laundered with Darkcoins (since the DRK exchange rate increased a lot shortly after the exit scam). This shows that it isn't a bad idea to exit the BTC blockchain if you want more safety and if you don't want to just rely on a tumbler. But if you're just a normal buyer BTC -> tumbler -> DNM would be enough.   Now that I have my doge coin back into BTC, do I need to send this to a tumbler? Or does this need to go to an electrum wallet and to the DNM?   BTC -> LTC -> XDG (Dogecoin) -> BTC -> DNM would be overkill, I'd recommend if your identity is tied to your BTC (which you want to send to a DNM), e.g. through a bank account: tumble. If not, e.g. you bought them through a BTC ATM, you could send them without tumbling to a DNM."

Even though there are no issues running TAILS, there are often issues connecting to networks, particularly wireless. The reason being, often times, TAILS does not recognize the network cards Apple has installed, probably due to proprietary technology.  I know it's not the same exact problem, but it could be your network card not being recognized by TAILS. I'm far from an expert, but this sounds pretty specific to TAILS.

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,340k5r,ItsJarvis,5,Mon Apr 27 10:16:18 2015 UTC,"Did you also got nervous like hell or where you the cool guy with sunglasses?   I guess everyone here was more or less nervous when they first placed an order. This isn't unusual, it's common sense: you try out something risky (concerning the theoretical consequences) for the first time and because of your greenness you worry that you fucked up somehow. This ""effect"" doesn't only apply for ordering drugs, the nervous feeling also kicks in if you do other adrenalin-rich activities for the first time (e.g. taking part in a match or robbing a bank for the first time).  However you'll be more calm and rational if you do these activities over and over again and you develop a routine.   What would you do if the cops are infront of your door and ask you what you ordered?   Remaining silent and having your lawyer on a quick dialing. Tip: search for a decent lawyer before you need one.   Or how can they get rid of police with drug searching dogs?   Shoot them. No seriously, if LE is allowed to search your house you can't just refuse to let them in. However contact your lawyer when they're knocking on your door and ask him for advice, If they confiscate something illegally (e.g. kicking your door in and searching your house without a warrant) you can later dispute in court the obtained evidence. Keep in mind that this is very unlikely because they rather use all kinds of rhetorical tricks to get information and evidence (e.g. confronting you at 7 a.m. with a package containing drugs which was send to you and urge you to let them in your house (""You don't mind if we can just come in?"" while stepping forward)).   Me and my friend are jiggling with the order. I buy it and get it delivered, my friend comes to a random place and gets the order from me and we wait till the next weekend. Then we share it together. So if the cops are at my house, they can search like hell but wouldn't find anything.   Should work, as long as your house is clean, you'll have nothing to fear when LE is knocking on your door."

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,340qxe,DavidHeff,2,Mon Apr 27 11:49:20 2015 UTC,"I assume the recommendation would be to just use libertyx to get btc and then tumble your coins to a second wallet if you wanted to clean your name from them.  So it would go something like: cash - libertyx pin - btc into wallet associated with name - tumble - clean wallet not linked to name. Now you'd have your coins in a wallet and can send what you need to your market wallet for a specific purchase.  can anyone else chime in?

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3408fv,whereismymassage,7,Mon Apr 27 07:10:09 2015 UTC,"No, use your home address with your name. You want the package to blend in with the rest of the mail going through the system. Anything that stands out is a huge red flag.  For PGP, use your market username as the name, some Tor-based email service if you're planning on doing direct deals with a vendor, and put jibberish for the comment. As an example, I use ""lol"" as the comment and ""lol@lol.lol"" for email field.   $50 USD should be enough. I don't use a tumbler so I'm not sure what the fees are, but I'd bet it's not all that much. Maybe 4% at most. You send your BTC to a wallet address, click a button, wait a bit. Tumbled coins will be deposited into a new address, then you can transfer them to a market/wallet from there.  Don't be sorry about the questions, that's what this sub is for!"

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3408fv,doingillegalstuff,3,Mon Apr 27 14:26:22 2015 UTC,"Even if you have, let's say drugs, shipped to your house, you still have plausible deniability that you knew nothing about it, even if you opened the package. Just claim that someone else must have been using your home as a drop location (similar to what you'd be doing to your neighbors). Better yet, contact your lawyer, and you still might get off scot-free.  On the other hand, if LE comes to your house with a warrant, finds that you've opened your neighbors mail, and it has drugs inside the package you're:   Going to be in trouble for opening someone else's mail, guaranteed. It is a Federal crime and up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine to hide, keep, or open others peoples mail without permission. Way more likely to get convicted for buying or being in possession of drugs, since it's way more suspicious that you just happen to have one package from your neighbors that just happens to contain something illegal.

Prefer online wallets that use .onion sites as your activity cannot be logged by the exit nodes. Do not use blockchain.info mixer. It provides anonymity only against beginners and is expensive. Goto settings in your wallet, then network  Enter SOCKS5 and under proxy enter 127.0.0.1 and port 9150.  Note that the default port for Tor is usually 9050. For the browser bundle use 9150.  You must start Tor Browser Bundle before opening the wallet for it to work.  I would stay away from thin wallets as they have privacy problems (a big subject I don't have space for here). If you really want to use them, you MUST use Tor or you are publicly declaring the details of ALL your transactions. You are publicly declaring all your addresses (present and future) and tying them to your IP. Electurm, suspiciously, does not let you change the network settings until you have already connected to the internet (which kind of defeats the purpose).

To do that, get a USB stick with at least 4gb space, and stick it in once Tails is up and running.  Then go to Applications>Tails>Tails Installer, and select the USB stick you just put in and go through the install process.  Now turn off yoru computer and take out the DVD, and instead boot to the USB stick.  (You may have to hit F2 or another key to change the BOIS boot options to make sure the USB stick gets booted before the hard drive.)  Once you are booted into the USB stick, THEN you can configure persistence from Applications>Tails>Configure Persistent Volume.  Then reboot into the USB stick again, and you'll have an option to enable persistence when it boots up, in the same area it asks you for ""More Options?  Yes/No"".  Once you have said ""yes"" to persistence and are all booted up, then you can open the mail client, and all the data and messages will be stored in your persistent folder, and you can use it how you want.  Or, as you mentioned, you can use your DVD and just manually configure Claws each time you start up.  But you can't save your messages or anything else that way.

They put abrax on warning because of a few posts claiming they got the server ip without offering any evidence whatsoever. They didnt put evo on warning despite the huge writeup theavid and gwern posted on them showing their incompetence and scamming backgrounds, like a fucking detailed dossier on these guys, more evidence than we've seen anywhere and no warning on their sidebar, no link to said document.  All that aside, most of the mod posts arent moderators moderating, their using it as their personal account, voicing their opinions, beating down on unpopular opinons, shit you just dont do if you hold any sort of authority.  The real kick in the nuts is that theavid's writeup on evo ended with them warning to stay the fuck away from markets that support carding and weapons since those draw the most ire from the FBI, and they still post links to these markets like its ok to use them, fuck them they were and still are a liability to the darknet community."

This is a two part process, firstly we use a 'bridge', which is a server which is not part of the Tor consensus, therefore your ISP doesn't see you sending traffic to a Tor relay. Second, the actual traffic itself is changed in appearance so it doesn't look like Tor traffic.   Have a read of this post:  https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges.html.en  You'll probably want to use an obfs3 bridge, this is free, and whilst it will probably make Tor slower (IME it doesn't make that much of a difference) it is better than paying for a VPN."

If they're giving you a deal over the market price of the drugs you can look at it like pricing your risk of them just telling you to fuck off. You should expect that if they ever decide to stop being a vendor and don't have the initiative to sell their drug business to another dealer that eventually you're gonna lose an order.   I'm 100% against FE on the markets. There is one vendor, MissJessica, whom I would deal with directly without hesitation. That is a business run like you're actually ordering from Amazon.

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,33jxsb,1234567as1,2,Thu Apr 23 03:01:55 2015 UTC,The markets are on TOR. You can't reach .onion addresses through I2P. The customers go where the markets are and new markets open and expand their capacity where their customers are. It self reenforces.
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,33jxsb,alphabigmouth,1 point,Thu Apr 23 13:42:00 2015 UTC,"The reason people don't use I2P as much is simply that before DNMs, I2P was much less useful than Tor, since you pretty much can't access the clearnet from I2P (AFAIK there are no functional outproxies at the moment).   So, I2P was a neat idea that pretty much nobody gave a shit about. It's recieved a lot less attention, much less scrutiny, and unlike the Tor devs, the I2P devs are a shadowy lot who don't make regular blog posts or have a lot of funding.  So if someone want's to set up a DNM, they have to learn how to securely set up an eepsite, and all that jazz, without a lot of the great Tor documentation.  So far the only market owner with the balls to do this was TMPSchultz. However TMP has since closed down."

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,33f5vt,NoRadiation,1 point,Wed Apr 22 00:48:37 2015 UTC,"Probably not for darknet market purposes.  You sign a message to prove that the message was really from you and not from someone pretending to be you. This is handy for normal email because it is possible to spoof an email so that it looks like it's coming from somebody else.  On darknet markets the messaging system tells the vendor who the message was from and you have to be logged into the persons account to be able to send a message as that person, so signing your messages to a vendor doesn't add a whole lot.  The main reason to not sign your messages to vendors is that they will rarely have your public key imported and marked as trusted, so it just adds a scary warning when they decrypt your message that you might not be you. This may confuse them. I think that there may also be a PGP client out there that refuses to decrypt messages signed by untrusted signatures."
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,33f5vt,ziz1,1 point,Wed Apr 22 01:16:28 2015 UTC,"""Signing"" the message with your key proves that you wrote it, becuase only your key could create a valid signature.  Sort of like how when you encrypt a message, only the other person can decrypt -- well with signing, everybody can read it, but only you could have ""signed"" it.  So if you sign it and encrypt it, then only the other person can read it, and he knows that only you could have written it.  I would advise AGAINST doing that.  If your vendor gets compromised and they get his messages, you can always claim somebody else used your account to send a message.  But if you sign it, that's just extra proof you wrote the message.  No reason to give that extra proof.  The only time you want to sign a message is when you want to prove that it came from you.  Most of the time, that's not going to be necessary."

When you connect to TOR, you're basically connecting to a server in some random location, which connects to another, and etc., which is constantly switching (AFAIK).

I can provide my opinion though.  In a world where LE will do anything and everything they can to bust you, you should do everything and anything you can to stay free. Tumbling is one way to prevent spending a large chunk of your life in jail. I used to think tumbling wasn't needed for buying personal amounts, but now it's known that LE will go after buyers if it's convenient for them.  Here's what I would do:   Buy BTC from exchange Transfer to clearnet wallet Transfer to darknet wallet Tumble Market   It's important that the darknet wallet does not touch the clearnet at any part during this process. Again, this is just my opinion. You should draw your own conclusions and do what you feel is necessary. Just keep in mind that with convenience comes risks.

Port 110 is normally reserved for unencrypted email access using the POP3 protocol. Tails sees that you are accessing another machine using that port number and warns you that it could allow others to read your unencrypted email.  Since you are not using it to access an email service and have ""SSL"" set for the protocol  in the network settings for Electrum (Tools > Network), the warning does not apply to you.

A lot of users are moving away from this since it allows a market to run away with your BTC in an exit scam.  Multi-sig is a way of preventing that. It's usually 2of3, which means that two out of three people (you, vendor, market) need to confirm that the order went well in order to release funds. If you check the sidebar in /r/DarkNetMarkets there should be a link to a multi-sig guide.   Multi-sig should be used. It does have a bit of a learning curve, and it does take a bit of your time, but it'll be worth it. If you do end up going with multi-sig make sure to grab alternate contact details off the vendor in case the market goes down."

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,33cxkn,redditulousfun,3,Tue Apr 21 14:46:30 2015 UTC,"If you are trying to compare vendor keys to see if they are the same, you need to import them with your PGP client and see what the key ID / key fingerprint is. Two keys can be the same, but look different when exported in an ascii armor format. Usually this difference is caused by other users signing a vendors key with their own key.  If the keys do have the same key ID / fingerprint, this does not mean that the vendor on the other market is legit. They could have just copied the public key to their profile from the real vendor. Only if a market forces vendors to prove that they can decrypt a message encrypted with that public key, or if you send them a message encrypted with that public key and they are able to decrypt it can you be assured that they are the same vendor."

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,33coga,hksupport,2,Tue Apr 21 14:51:09 2015 UTC,"There is a fully functional pgp applet software built into TAILS that will do all the work for you. But in order to save your keys from one session to the next, you do have to enable and configure a persistent volume, which stores all your info, like passwords and keys, in encryption, which is what I think the previous poster meant. To enable persistence just go to applications, choose ""TAILS"" and then ""configure persistent volume."""

This is the key fingerprint that I have for the Tails signing key:  A490 D0F4 D311 A415 3E2B  B7CA DBB8 02B2 58AC D84F   Try certifying the key in Kleopatra like this:  Right click on the Tails key, select ""Certificate Details"" and check to make sure the key fingerprint listed matches what I show.  Once you have verified the key fingerprint, right click on the key and select ""Certify Certificate"".  Check mark the Tails key.  Check mark ""I have verified the fingerprint"".  Hit Next.  Select which of your keys you want to sign it with.  Select ""Certify for myself"".  Hit ""Certify"".  Enter the passphrase for your key.  Hit Finish.

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3376oz,stewbie_doobie,1 point,Tue Apr 21 02:47:01 2015 UTC,"Information is written to the disk.  And other applications might interact with it.  For example, if you're in Windows, traces are definitely going to be left in the registry and like if you have search indexing turned on, the names of files and even some contents may inadvertantly get backed up.  It's just a whole huge extra risk.  Now compare that with Tails, which runs entirely in RAM, and which is completely isolated and separated from your computer and guaranteed won't leave any trace.  Sure, you could use Tor securely without Tails, but man, why go through all that effort."
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,3376oz,hksupport,0,Wed Apr 22 06:35:44 2015 UTC,You can leave traces of your activity on the system. If you download a PGP key from a vendor and use a application such as PGP4USB to encrypt a message with it the PGP key remains imported into the application. Even if you delete the application unless you use a secure deletion tool it can probably be recovered. Even if you securely delete it your operating system probably retains some traces of it in the registry and event logs. When you use TAILS all of the data is either deleted when you shut it down or hidden within your encrypted partition.

Yes, practically anyone who knows what they're doing can access your computer / network and see what you're doing and most ISPs and websites keep records of everything you do online.

With a darknet purchase you have already got all of the product by the time you have the chance to test it. I would just rely on your mouth, if the tab is bitter or numbing it is NBOMe so spit it out. If it is a reputable vendor your chances of being sent NBOMe are pretty much zero, you would be more likely to be sent a empty ""underdosed"" blotter than be sent something as easily detected as NBOMe."

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,330b9h,thisisforreviews,2,Sat Apr 18 06:43:48 2015 UTC,"Should I sign my messages?   No.  The vendor's will rarely have your key imported and marked as trusted.   If they don't have your key imported, they will get a message like this:  gpg: Can't check signature: No public key   If they do have your key imported but not marked as trusted, they will get a scary warning like this:  gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature! gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.   which may confuse them.  There's not really any advantage to a vendor for you to sign your messages . They know who the message is from, because the market message interface tells them. Just as long as they get their money, they don't really care if you are really you.   Buyers make too many mistakes using PGP as it is without the vendors having to check to make sure that messages are properly signed and that the buyers public key hasn't changed without warning.  Since law enforcement can just create accounts and buy items in order to profile a vendor, they don't really need to take over a buyer's account. If they do bust a buyer and take over their account, they buyer will likely need to cooperate so that LE will have the account name and password and in that case, the buyer will give up the password to their PGP key as well."

I like the fact that you can run it from a CD or USB stick, they both have pros and cons, USB sticks can be written to so that leaves them vulnerable to attack/interception while you are running TAILS from them, since a CD cannot be written to once it's got an ISO burned onto it, a CD is a good choice. All you gotta do in TAILS if you are in a bind is just shut it down and bam everything incriminating has been obfuscated, that is what really makes TAILS appealing to me. Have you ever dabbled with Whonix at all? But remember, just like in networking, in staying anonymous and secure, ""layer 8"" issues are where most slip ups always occur.  Other ways to help remain anonymous in my opinion are listed here: Change the way you type, everyone has certain quirks that make them stand out even in the way they type and communicate via emails and forums. use a password generator for every single password you create when dealing with anon services consider using bitcoin tumbling services if you are going to be transferring large sums of bitcoin use PGP when communicating!!! Remember when using TOR, your traffic might be unintelligible, but your ISP, school network, etc. can still see you are using TOR over the network, and just using TOR can raise red flags in some cases. I would create some throw away emails if you are only going to use them for a short amount of time, and ditch them afterwards. Buying bitcoins can be done through legitimate sources, for instance, you can buy Bitcoin from Coinbase, but you'll need to use your real name and information in order to do so, but once you do, you can then transfer them to as many wallets as you like, even though every wallet address transfer is publicy logged via blockchain, it's still not divulging your personal information.  I wouldn't do any kind of illegal activities or (if you want to remain truly anonymous) from your windows computer at home). Not even if you are on a VPN.  I'd use public networks, or do some war driving and find another network to work from. Name your computer something random too, I have seen all too often during security audits ""Peter Smiths-PC"" pop up in a scan, not smart."

Rarely will a package ever break anything since they're tested before reaching the main repos, unless you opt-in to the unstable/testing repos. It's just really simple to use and issues are quickly sorted due to popularity.  My second favorite distro is Arch. I love it since you can build the OS to meet your needs, but since it's a rolling-release distro you're bound to run into issues eventually (despite what the Arch fanboys say). It's great for learning since if something breaks, you can fix it yourself. But that takes a lot of time that I don't feel like spending. It's a hobbyist distro IMO."

You can delete the HP_TOOLS partition (approved by HP support here, and it can be reinstalled on a USB drive if you ever need it.)  You'll then need to shrink the partition that Windows is installed on so you can have space to install Ubuntu. This usually goes fine, but there is a chance that data will be corrupted.  Last step is to create a new partition with that free space, and you can finally install Ubuntu.

If you're buying a large amount of BTC or buying for resale, I'd say tumbling is mandatory. If it's just personal amounts then tumbling isn't really necessary. I've never tumbled my coins, I just did Exchange > Wallet1 > Wallet2 > Market. This isn't anything like tumbling, but it provides plausible deniability since you can say you sold your BTC."

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,32ryoh,hksupport,2,Thu Apr 16 16:06:10 2015 UTC,"I believe that ""escrow"" on BB means multisig escrow, meaning that your payment is sent to a multisig address, so that it is locked up until you finalize.  ""Central"" means, as you guessed, that the market is doing the escrow service and they just hold the money themselves.  PGP is a method of encrypting messages.  Usually the good security practice is to encrypt your shipping info.  That way if the market servers are compromised or if the vendor's computer is seized by police, your info is encrypted and you cannot be linked to any of it.  Encrypting all your messages is generally just good standard practice.  PGP is a bit of a pain in the butt to learn to use, but you'll be glad you know it after you learn it.  As for using Coinbase, it is my understanding that currently all markets have you send your money to them, and then they do all the financing internally.  So you would need to move the money from Coinbase to the market.  Be careful!  Coinbase monitors transactions in and out of their site, for compliance reasons (or so they say), and even if your market gives you a fresh deposit address, it may be possible for Coinbase to determine that it is a market.  That's merely a possibility though, it's not guaranteed, so don't freak out too much.  It might be fine to go directly from Coinbase to your market, but as a general rule, tumbling your coins first is a good idea."

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,32rzjp,dnm1139,3,Thu Apr 16 06:08:18 2015 UTC,"No, do not use any online PGP method. There are PGP tools for each available desktop OS, and you can check my submission history for newb-friendly guides that have pictures. You would encrypt any and all sensitive information, which includes your address/name.  Setting up a PO box is a good idea if you're living with parents or people that will snoop your mail.   The most popular method for tumbling is using Heeeeeelix by Grams (with  only one e, AutoMod is a dictator). You send the BTC to an address, they mix your BTC with other BTC, and then you get the BTC (minus a fee) back."
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,32rzjp,MLP_is_my_OPSEC,3,Thu Apr 16 06:59:55 2015 UTC,"""PGP"" is basically a method for encrypting a message.  It's a standard.  And there's various different types of software that implement that standardized way of doing encryption.  So when you are asked to PGP encrypt something, what that means is to use one of those pieces of software to encrypt something in a specific way.  Part of that method involves ""keys"".  Basically other people give you a block of text that is their ""public key"" and you can instruct the encryption to use their public key, and then the resulting encrypted data can only be decrypted by them. Not even you can decrypt it!  Additionally, you can create your own public key, and you would also have your own private key, which would enable you to decrypt messages sent from other people that are encrypted for your public key.  PGP software handles this all for you, so the user experience is just copy/paste hit ""encrypt"" or ""decrypt"" and then copy/paste the new encrypted/decrypted text.  The automoderator bot in this sub is fairly strict, so I can't mention any names of software.  When a vendor asks you to PGP encrypt your shipping info, what they mean is to use PGP software to encrypt (to their public key) what your mailing address is.  That way, they have your mailing address, but the website does not have it because it's encrypted.  Additionally, if the police find the website or bust your vendor and get his computer, because it was encrypted, they don't know you were sent anything.  Basically, it's for your own protection.  It keeps your address information hidden from everybody except the vendor.  Using PGP for all messages, not just shipping info, is concerned good security practice.  As for the PO box -- I cannot comment on the best shipping and receiving methods.  As for tumbling coins -- that has to do with how Bitcoin works.  When you use Bitcoins, if you don't take certain precautions, it can sometimes be easy to know that you were the one making a transaction.  This is because Bitcoin transactions are public, and the privacy of Bitcoins comes from the fact that the accounts used in transactions don't necessarily identify you IRL.  The problem is that often they DO identify you.  So ""tumbling"" your coins is basically mixing your coins with a lot of other people's coins.  For example, if I and 100 other people each put 1 coin into a jar and shake that jar and then each pull a coin out, nobody knows whose coin belongs to who now. All you know is you got a new coin that has a 1/100 chance of being your original one. That's basically what mixing is. It a method of obscuring your Bitcoins so that your Bitcoin transactions cannot be linked back to you the person.  As for how to do it, there are popular services that do it, or you can do it yourself if you find a lot of other people who are looking to do that."

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,32pr14,kinfesldfjszd,2,Wed Apr 15 18:51:48 2015 UTC,Don't store your coins in an online wallet. If something happens to the site you're shit out of luck.  If you're moving BTC from one wallet to another that's not tumbling. Tumbling is mixing your BTC with other BTC so it makes it harder to trace them back to you. Moving BTC from wallet1 to wallet2 provides plausible deniability since you can say you sold the BTC.
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,32pr14,MLP_is_my_OPSEC,1 point,Wed Apr 15 19:10:49 2015 UTC,Well when buying the coins should you use a fke name on the profile you purchase them from. Also if you try and purchase BTC you dont have to actually buy one whole BTC right? You can put in a certain amount of money and you get 'x' number of BTC for use?
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,32pr14,sdgdsfgdsfg,1 point,Wed Apr 15 19:21:30 2015 UTC,"If the profile/purchase isn't linked to your real name, go for it. Else use your real name. You can buy as many BTC as you need, be that 0.1 or 1000."
DarkNetMarketsNoobs,32pr14,MLP_is_my_OPSEC,2,Wed Apr 15 19:36:13 2015 UTC,"Imgaine you have a penny, and you find 100 other people with a penny, and you all get together and put your pennies in a jar and shake that jar and pull out a penny.  That's tumbling your coins.  What you are suggesting is merely having two jars that are still only owned and operated by you.  That does not provide any increased security benefit, since everybody knows coins coming from those jars belong to you."

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,32mx59,heymkdlkmf,3,Wed Apr 15 01:53:33 2015 UTC,If you didn't purchase the BTC with anything that links to your real identify that'll work. Otherwise at least have another wallet between the first wallet and the market so you have some sort of plausible deniability.

Due to the fluctuating price of BTC you may not have enough by the time you go to make your order."

DarkNetMarketsNoobs,32mqtm,pinkpony124,5,Wed Apr 15 01:01:30 2015 UTC,"Format your HDD and install Gentoo    In all seriousness though, it's important to understand why using Windows is not a good idea when you want to remain secure and anonymous. Windows is a closed source operating system, which means that nobody -- other than those that have been granted permission -- are allowed to see the source code that make up the operating system. This means that you can't be 100% certain that it doesn't have NSA/GCHQ/CSIS/KKK backdoors hidden somewhere. You can't also know whether Microsoft is sending data somewhere in accordance to whatever bullshit anti-terrorism laws they're forced to follow.  You're also susceptible to an increased risk of malware. As of this month Windows has ~91% market share on personal computers. This makes it an obvious target.  While you'll probably be fine as long as you use Tor Browser Bundle and PGP at bare minimum on Windows, I wouldn't recommend it. Definitely give that Tails link a look."
