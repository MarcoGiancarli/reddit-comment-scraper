sips,3duucj,igsey,-1,Sun Jul 19 18:58:55 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed that, but I'm going to offer some criticism.    It doesn't really look like sips. It looks like what I imagined sips looking like before I ever saw his face. Your rendering has far too much hair, and it is far too thick. Also, sips has a much more oval face (I realize that's the style, I just noticed that and I think it detracts from the likeness). Is it really a speed drawing if it took an hour? I watched the process, but it's really a rather simple rendering, and I wouldn't expect it to take much more than an hour. When I saw ""speed drawing"" I thought that 5 minutes would be real time.   Those two things said, I did enjoy your work. I really like the art, i would just never peg it as sips if i had to guess. Just keep going and keep getting better!"
sips,3duucj,Rkupcake,3,Mon Jul 20 03:19:15 2015 UTC,"I think it's a drawing of Sips_ rather than Chris Lovasz, hence the grey skin and hair - his minecraft character is pretty hairy too.   I agree with you about the speed drawing though, although it was still done in one session which is fairly impressive in itself."

sips,3dsrxj,EskimoTree,15,Sun Jul 19 02:49:36 2015 UTC,I love that you mentioned that he doesnt get personal... every youtuber who shares personal life information always has such cringey fans... We know what boundaries are man
sips,3dsrxj,HomespunMurderStory,4,Sun Jul 19 03:45:28 2015 UTC,totally. i think this sub really benefits from not knowing too many personal details about the man.
sips,3dsrxj,shawnsullivan93,3,Sun Jul 19 11:25:00 2015 UTC,"He's created a mystery about himself, his personal life at least. It helps us like him, but also keeps us detached. I would personally do the same, if I were in his position.  I watch sips for how he reacts to those ridiculous moments like the dump truck with the glassinator, the santa thing with simon in jaffaquest, and probably countless others that im forgetting. Sips' humor is really uplifting for me and I relate to his character, at least what he gives us of his character.   He's one of the few youtubers that feels honest, you know?"
sips,3dsrxj,aadesousa,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:51:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, all we know about his personal life is that he has a wife and kid,  he is balding, and has an office space he rents out. I like that about the guy!"
sips,3dsrxj,ODBoBSTER,18,Mon Jul 20 02:27:52 2015 UTC,"Sips creates this atmosphere whenever he plays a game that makes even the smallest details such humorous things to more of an extent than I feel I ever could with some of the games. When he first started Skyrim, I had already played over 250 hours of it yet I knew that he would bring that level of personality to it that would make it something completely different than I experienced. I must admit that his reactions are pretty priceless, and I have to say, even those dick-ripping moments were special (although reconstructive surgery has cost me trillions of dollars, I must admit). Really, everything about him that is fantastic is summarized in his channel trailer . Honestly I could keep talking but I've relayed my point about why, for me, Sips is the real guy, the best guy."
sips,3dsrxj,seagramsextradrygin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:40:50 2015 UTC,"Yes! I completely agree. I was hooked when I saw his reactions to some weird little glitches in episode 2 of the Skyrim series:  The Dancing Cheese Platter: https://youtu.be/EaUzN0VULMU?t=7m47s  ""You people are animals!"": https://youtu.be/EaUzN0VULMU?t=16m38s  To anyone else these are just slightly amusing bugs which you pretty much expect to see now and then. To sips the haunted cheese is so disturbing that he leaves the house in disgust before talking to anyone, and the people jumping on their dinner table upsets him so much that he thoroughly scolds the family. This is sips at his best."

sips,3dsrxj,somethingindoing63,14,Sun Jul 19 05:23:28 2015 UTC,"To be fair sips isn't really bad at games.  If you had videos of the first couple hours of every game you've played you'd look like a dumb ass too.  He never does tutorials (or rarely does), and he generally gets the hang of every game he plays.  Also I'm 99.9% sure he does half the stuff he does as sort of a semi-troll.  He also thinks way outside of the box and makes things work in his own way, which is why I enjoy watching him.  I mean look at the Bridge Constructor content from the xmas live streams.  He was making jumps for simple bridge designs and eventually he got them to work.  I highly doubt many people even attempt that shit in games."

sips,3dsrxj,somethingindoing63,7,Sun Jul 19 06:12:40 2015 UTC,There are many reasons but I think I mostly enjoy the way he thinks outside the box.  A lot of people (including myself a lot of times) just move from point-to-point doing objectives and such to get through games.  Sips on the other hand will find so much joy in the little things while not giving a damn about objectives.  Case in point: sips playing bridge constructor during the live streams.  Dude was making the simplest bridges work in the craziest ways.
sips,3dsrxj,JamieAubrey,6,Sun Jul 19 06:12:58 2015 UTC,Sips has me tied up in his basement and forces me to watch his stuff 24/7   wait..... why am I writing this ? SEND HEEEELP !!!!!!

sips,3dsrxj,JacobCoy,5,Sun Jul 19 17:41:22 2015 UTC,my introduction to sips was when he flew into the jaffa factory compound to work on the sipsco property. I was blown away by his idgaf attitude; it was something i hadn't seen before.   i continue to watch him because he simply has fun with every little aspect of games; aspects that I overlook completely in my race to just beat games. it's immensely satisfying.   i've never seen somebody have so much fun kicking dogs in GTA.

sips,3dry04,Xadrunas,2,Sat Jul 18 23:15:13 2015 UTC,I love that game I have about over 100 hours of gameplay in it. The first week is easy but the difficulty spike is insane and you can become bankrupt by the second week without fail. Luckily you can repeat back to the start again with all your items so it gets easier. Just keep looping and going into the dungeon to get free loot to sell.  Once you've paid off the insane loan you get a free play mode and continue where you were with no loan threat. You can start unlocking more dungeons and heroes. Also the item crafting is almost impossible to get 100%.

It reminded me of the moment when Sips completely shuts down the entrance to the EuroTunnel. Starts around 2 minutes in. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9U5X6t6wg4"

sips,3dq341,levipoep,7,Sat Jul 18 10:01:42 2015 UTC,"to be fair, streaming is a very different format altogether. i can't watch any stream with my internet, and while i can watch the youtube vods, I can't really interact with the stream, whereas he quite often addresses the audience of that stream. it becomes a bit weird in that sense, and very different from a youtube series, and resulted in me not really checking on his channel as often.  however to me there is no point going to either youtube comments or creating reddit threads about it, because ultimately sips does what he wants and i'm just here for the ride. i'm merely explaining why some are displeased with the decision to stream more in general."
sips,3dq341,Borgusul,5,Sun Jul 19 01:37:00 2015 UTC,"This is the point I agree with. An episode by episode dynamic is far different than interacting with a live audience. Sips is focused more on the game and task at hand when playing regularly vs. live. His commentary and rambling are far different as well. When watching the live stream of GTA he just fucks around a lot and it's not entertaining. Comparing this to the most recent evening with Sips, Red Dead, the entire time he is roleplaying as well as kind of fucking around, talking to the NPC's, getting into the atmosphere of the game, etc. Once the livestream comes into the equation all that dynamic is gone."
sips,3dq341,amarx93,2,Sun Jul 19 02:48:35 2015 UTC,"This is about the way I feel, I would prefer if sips made red dead into a regular series with cool edits and everything like he did with skyrim, partially because I feel like that's part of what gave sips videos their charm in the past and partially because I have shitty internet and can't watch streams.  But I'm very thankful he uploads thirty minute chunks onto YouTube so that I can still watch.  And I think it is perfectly fine for people to voice their concerns as long as they are civil about it, criticism is help.  But people shouldn't be pissed at him for anything he does, they aren't the ones paying him."
sips,3dq341,George-Dubya-Bush,10,Sun Jul 19 02:53:46 2015 UTC,"I too really hate when people feel entitled to things - especially with sips.  sips' best content is when he is doing exactly what he wants and has fun with it.  plus, uploading the stream to the live channel has been so awesome and even if i cant keep up with it - id rather have that problem than the reverse!"
sips,3dq341,jakethesnakes,2,Sat Jul 18 15:13:42 2015 UTC,"I have to respectfully disagree with you on some points. While I'm sure Sips has a blast being a youtuber, you have to realize that it is a job, and that he has to entertain us or else he won't make money. Im not a youtube expert, but I think it is safe to say that Sips is making money with youtube with around 2 million subs.  Don't get me wrong, I could watch anything Sips does and be happy, but when a large portion of his fanbase complains, something is off. You say that Sips is at his best when he is doing exactly what he wants, but I would argue that Sip's Skyrim playthrough was much more enjoyable than his various gmod videos.   I'm not saying that Sips should cave in and stop streaming because some his fans are upset. I respect that Sips does what he wants, and it is part of the reason that he IS my favorite youtuber. But when Sips all of the sudden is only playing gmod, or he halts some of his playthroughs and does a lot of streaming, you can't really blame people for getting upset.   If you hired a band to come play some nice acoustic at your party, and halfway through they changed to jazz, would you be upset?   It depends on your preference."

sips,3dq341,MrSneak,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:00:02 2015 UTC,"I can understand people being upset. I can't watch the livestreams either - stupid 3mbps internet won't even stream in medium. But the truth is, Sips is HAPPY doing this. This sexy man-babby has entertained me daily for years, and never asked for a thing. I, and I believe everyone else, should respect his decision. A happy Sips is a fun Sips. He does tons for his community, and we'd all do well to let him livestream as much as he wants and be happy he hasn't thrown in the towel from all the negativity so far."
sips,3dq341,layziegtp,2,Mon Jul 20 23:19:56 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, but I can't help but feel that Sips isn't good enough at communicating with us. Maybe I missed something, but I don't remember Sips saying anything like ""Oh yeah guys im gunna halt these playthroughs and stream a bunch"". I think if Sips would just tell us what he's doing instead of just dropping the ball and picking up the spoon, his fans would not react as harshly."
sips,3dq341,MrSneak,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:34:20 2015 UTC,"while i'm sure sips has a blast being a youtuber, you have to realize that it is a job, and that he has to entertain us or else he won't make money.   https://twitter.com/Sips_/status/560811859016966145   if you hired a band to come play some nice acoustic at your party, and halfway through they changed to jazz, would you be upset?   if i paid the band as much as we pay sips (i.e. nothing) id be happy they showed up at all.    We aren't sips' customers.  if we were, he'd be chasing views and we'd be paying.  instead he is doing what he loves and what he enjoys, and hopefully it makes a bunch of us happy to be on the ride."
sips,3dq341,jakethesnakes,2,Sun Jul 19 17:22:52 2015 UTC,"It is true that it is not a ""job"" in normal aspects, but that doesn't mean that Sips shouldn't listen to his fans.   Not that Sips doesn't listen to his fans, but I feel like there is a sort of disconnect and lack of information. When you have around 2 million subs and the content you put out all of the sudden changes, there is going to be feedback.   I'm just trying to defend the crowd that is upset with the changes, because they have some legitimate reasons to be upset. What level they take it to is on them, but no matter how harsh they react, I feel like the mentality that they are ""entitled pricks"" is unfair."
sips,3dq341,MrSneak,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:50:28 2015 UTC,"Since this simple concept doesn't seem to be getting through the heads of you people complaining about ""entitlement"", let me put it in an even simpler way.  If a fan doesn't like the direction Sips's content is going recently, there's only two things he/she can do:   Stop watching. Give feedback/criticism on what they dislike/like about the channel.   There's no third option for ""suck it up and keep watching', because why would anybody watch content that they dislike? So the simple fact is, you're not changing anything by trying to silence people. You're simply telling them to leave without even offering their opinion. That doesn't benefit Sips or his viewerbase in any way, shape, or form. I want this channel to get better and better, and I hope Sips does too, which is why I think dismissing criticism by shouting ""LEL ITS NOT MY JOB"" is unconstructive. In the end, all that will lead to is an even greater disconnect between Sips and his viewers."
sips,3dq341,Frodolas,8,Sun Jul 19 21:22:39 2015 UTC,"If people miss the stream, they can always watch the videos on Sips Live. Then it's just a normal YouTube video but with a face cam."

sips,3dq341,Frodolas,2,Sat Jul 18 10:55:52 2015 UTC,Normal content is well-edited to remove filler and low-effort material. Watching stream videos on Youtube is the epitome of low-effort content.

sips,3dq341,TheBronzeBastard,3,Sun Jul 19 16:50:29 2015 UTC,"My advice would be to stay away from those godawful hell holes, but there is a possible dilemma in posting stream highlights as content on your main channel. Captainsparklez was doing the same for a while and started to realize that for the most ""loyal,"" fans (or just the ones who habitually watched his streams) a huge chunk of uploads on his channel were things they'd seen already.   As an example, he had a long-running stream series going on for a while, and each day after streaming he'd upload a trimmed down highlights version. With a ""two videos a day,"" upload schedule, half the content a lot of people were getting was just shorter versions of things they'd already seen, thus cutting their content input in half.  The solution he came to was to make a second channel purely for uncut stream footage. On his main channel, he would only upload Youtube-specific content with the very occasional stream highlight. Every channel and fanbase is different though, and comment sections certainly shouldn't be taken as actual useful criticism, unless they're offering input regarding the game."

Like /u/kavkav9876 has said, subscriber count isn't really the objective, it's just a place for people to view the streams and to not miss out because the VoD's are slow, missing bits or something like that. I think the way you're going about it is perfectly ok and I (and I'm sure sips too) am quite happy you're enjoying the uploads and streams in general!"

sips,3dsz51,Roboevan,2,Sun Jul 19 04:33:57 2015 UTC,I have no idea how to do it (maybe /u/dapperzan does) but I think it would be a good idea to only send a sub box alert for the first video of each day's uploads and to have an annotation to the next part at the end of each video. Day9TV does this with his multi part stream YouTube uploads so there must be a setting somewhere. Ultimately it just means things are a little less spammy.

sips,3diufh,Invisible-Gorilla,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:25:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah but when it does happen, it won't be as intrusive as it gets with some streamers who constantly thank new subs."
sips,3diufh,mtcbh,18,Sat Jul 18 04:29:45 2015 UTC,"Depends on the youtuber, really. Sips is a great streamer, his reactions were made for facecams and real time. I'd still like to see more 'regular' content on his channel, but the streams are just fine by me."
sips,3diufh,1047_Josh,7,Thu Jul 16 17:14:41 2015 UTC,"I personally can't fault youtubers for making the switch at least in part like sips has.  Youtube relies on ad-views for revenue, however subbing to a broadcaster on Twitch means a fan is directly sending $2.50 a month to the streamer they enjoy (and the other $2.50 a month to Twitch).  It's hard to blame any content creators for the switch in format to a potentially more consistent income stream (if they continues to build and maintain a streaming community) no matter the change in final video production quality when most of his youtube ""subs"" watch with adblock anyway and as youtube numbers have been slowly declining across the board for a while now.   That's only one of a number of reasons I can think of that cause this new way to be more advantageous (others are viewer interaction, amount of time with a game per play-session, etc).  Even with that understanding established, I can't say I don't mourn the likelihood that will never see a long series produced the way they skyrim series was again.  Of course, one can't just constantly attempt to mimic past glory without it seeming forced or growing stale anyway."
sips,3diufh,IWasMeButNowHesGone,16,Thu Jul 16 19:17:11 2015 UTC,"For the most part he does seem to only talk with the chat about what he's doing in the game, and I like the addition of the face cam.  There's also a lot more content than I can keep up with which is nice. It is a different kind of content though and I can see why that would make it less immersive for you.  Luckily for me I haven't finished watching the skyrim LP he made so I have half of that left to go so I get the best of both worlds."
sips,3diufh,tonybateman,5,Thu Jul 16 17:09:27 2015 UTC,"I love both. I can't say I prefer one over the other, because I gotta take into consideration how happy sips is doing the video. you can tell when sips isn't into it quite as much and the quality can suffer as a result. but that's separate from the format really.  i'm sure sips will eventually get a bit tired of live streaming and go back over to 'regular' videos for a change. whatever really, as long as he's enjoying it."
sips,3diufh,armosnacht,11,Thu Jul 16 20:30:50 2015 UTC,"I prefer the livestreams. more content, sips is happier, he does what he wants for however long he wants. great interaction with viewers."
sips,3diufh,zlopras,4,Thu Jul 16 17:45:35 2015 UTC,"Personally I'm kind of liking his new format. If i'm in I get to watch a livestream while I play a game, or do internet stuff. If I'm working then I get to come home and watch highlights (which from watching livestreams of I understand the context of) or if he's uploaded proper lets play I can watch that.  Also if I remember rightly in his highlights he doesn't do much subscriber stuff, more funny standalone lets play'y stuff. I don't know, it works for me. But if suddenly every lets player I watched did it,  I probably wouldn't like it as much. But if it keeps them in a job, it's the best case scenario really.  I don't know, it's different... But different isn't bad... right?"
sips,3diufh,Wolf_Base,11,Fri Jul 17 00:20:32 2015 UTC,"I love Sips' content and almost only watched him exclusively when I had the time, but I don't have the time to watch or participate in his twitch livestreams. I don't  mind the new channel, but it seems a little empty. Long and fun playthroughs were made so much better by his awesome editing, and I feel that these live recordings are just chopped and posted. The highlights are fun, but the editing would be so much better if it was incorporated into the content itself. On top of that, because of all his streaming, he stopped the rambles. I loved listening to a ramble while doing chores and such. I tried to play a livestream while doing chores, but it was 90% ""Oh my god did you see that!?"" And replying to chat which I am not a part of.  TLDR:  I think there is a place and certain games for livestreaming, but I miss a good playthrough of a modern(ish) game with funny edits."
sips,3diufh,Tecuani,3,Thu Jul 16 19:06:59 2015 UTC,"Sips works really hard and provides a lot for us. I don't watch the livestreams however. Mainly because I just don't find the time for them. I guess I could re-watch them on his 2nd channel but I just get overwhelmed with 6 videos a day. But I actually really like Sid Meier's Pirates, so I'm good when it comes to regular content. I fully trust Sips with what he is doing and what direction he wants to go to. And if he wants to stream, so be it. I just hope that he doesn't completely forget his youtube audience."
sips,3diufh,sodabox_,3,Thu Jul 16 17:22:57 2015 UTC,"As I have heard the income of youtubers usually drops after the Christmas-New Year period, and slowly recovers in a few months. Problem is, this year it dropped and stayed that way. So my guess is that some people stream more to make up for that loss of income (donations and subscription helps). This is also why there is so much more merch around in general (i.e. not just Yogscast). Now that it is summer, some youtubers are on holiday (e.g. Hat Films traveled quite a lot in the last few weeks, so that's why some of their stuff is ""recycled"" footage), so that is also a reason of some highlight videos. Last, but not least, in Sips' case work trips, family vacations and all this aside, his second kid is on the way. So there is that. I personally really don't mind, I enjoy the footage of the livestreams too, for me it doesn't take out any of the immersion or fun. It's just more stuff to watch, but obviously I don't expect everyone to agree with this. Edit: wording."
sips,3diufh,noob_senpai,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:54:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not doubting you, just curious, where do you get your information about the youtuber income?"
sips,3diufh,mtcbh,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:34:50 2015 UTC,"I have tried to look it up just now, all I found is a quick mention of lower youtube income by TB during a conversation in the Co-Optional podcast with Sips. He mentions it again in an another video in more details here. I'm pretty sure I have heard it from someone else too, but I cannot recall from whom and where... so I hope that this will do it for now, TB is pretty open and accurate with the financial side of youtube."
sips,3diufh,noob_senpai,2,Sat Jul 18 05:47:05 2015 UTC,"I had a thought earlier today, that might make people happy.   What if Sips played a different game each day of the week.  For example, Mondays he'd play Red Dead Redemption, Tuesdays Terraria, Wednesdays Witcher, etc.  That way the people that watch the live streams still get their live streams, and the people that watch on YouTube don't get flooded with 6 videos of the same game every day."
sips,3diufh,siv9939,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:03:24 2015 UTC,"It's a different format than what a lot of us are used to and the videos have a completely different tone and feel. Watching something recorded ""live"" from days before isn't the same as watching a video that was recorded and edited specifically to be seen later.  Basically if I watch the stuff on the live stream channel it's because, aside from the occasional Pirates episode on the old main channel, there's nothing else available."
sips,3diufh,Invisible-Gorilla,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:47:40 2015 UTC,"It is nice to have a lets play series that is in one complete package, with a story/narrative elements you can follow throughout. The livestream highlights and VODs don't really have this. However, if you just want to watch Sips playing a game, then livestreaming provides many more hours of this. I guess it's a trade off."

Red Dead is one of my favorite games and I don't think I can bear to watch Sips play it the way he does.   Sometimes, just sometimes, do you think he acts like an idiot, ignores tutorial tooltips and messages, and forgets stuff on purpose?"
sips,3dfqyq,theSeanO,2,Thu Jul 16 18:05:11 2015 UTC,"hate to say it but after years watching, I think that sometimes.  trying to recapture the glory of bungling past successes.  not that it's the worst thing in the world, after all what do we know about making a living as a gaming content creator, yet i must admit it does pull me out of the magic of watching when that feeling arises.   or perhaps it's natural for him to miss stuff on screen when it constantly endeavoring to continue talking.  of course one would think it only natural that after having played so many open world games, he would know he has to at least follow some of the early bits and instructions before the world opens up to avoid missing or retreading material."
sips,3dfqyq,IWasMeButNowHesGone,0,Thu Jul 16 19:27:02 2015 UTC,"I'd say he is cavalier; casually unconcerned.  He plays most video games like RPG puzzles... he is dropped into this other life in a different world, and is interested in the life and the world and the funny details and quirks the creators of the experience decided to incorporate.    From this perspective having the game mechanics explained to you is a weird cheat when you could alternatively have the rewarding experience of figuring out the mechanics yourself.  He almost has to force himself to play the game 'right', and progress from A to B to C and experience the normal experience that the designers put together... he'd clearly much rather put together his own adventures and see what he can get away with in this other world."

sips,3djhcl,Diddy_Dan1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:04:45 2015 UTC,"They can subscribe to the live channel, it doesn't come with any obligations and it's free, so I don't see the issue of subscribing there.

sips,3djhcl,Diddy_Dan1,0,Thu Jul 16 21:09:10 2015 UTC,"I think with clearly stating of how this playthrough will be in the beginning of the first red dead video, he tried to get people to use the new channel in case they feel they need more content from him. The issue is that some say that his streams are ""worse quality"" than his regular videos, so I assume he is keeping the whole stream footage from the main channel for that reason. Obviously, quality really depends on one's expectations, perception and taste and while e.g. I would be fine seeing those videos on the main channel, others would just go nuts and say over and over again how crap it is (which is really, really just an opinion and not the ultimate truth they think it is). It is certainly different, but that doesn't mean that it's crap - at the same time I agree with him that it might be a good idea to separate these things now just to avoid even more tension. (Note: I might be off with these assumptions, I don't see the stuff that is going on in the background.) Edit: added red dead"

He has stated that he will finish Fallout, and he will keep playing Cities. The reason he stopped is exactly because of having the episodic format. He got bored and lost because, in the midst of all the things I listed above, he couldn't record as often and ended up not remembering what he was doing last time. He dislikes having to record half an hour just once a week, taking months to have even 20 hours of gameplay. I agree with the Skyrim sentiment, but for Sips' current life and the state of his channel and the rest of the Yogs channels, it is difficult to focus on just one game like that. Streaming is a preferable option as he can just play for 4 hours and be done. No editing, and only an upload to the Live channel. I do agree he could find things for his main channel that wont be annoying or confusing like that, probably less story based games. More survival game or tycoon playthroughs would be awesome in my opinion. On to your other complaints; they are whiny, immature, and completely ridiculous. Twitch is a fantastic service, and if you are just looking to follow a single person, it is probably better than YouTube. Since it is streamed, there is no editing or uploading, he can directly interact with his fans as he's playing, and he can create hours of content easily. For you to complain about doing stupid strawpolls or dumb things for fans is idiotic. He has always said silly things and made silly faces. Every Evening With Sips is essentially the ""strawpoll"" you are talking about, and he's always had poor, minimalistic editing anyways so it isn't very different. I love watching him on Twitch. For you to say you refuse to watch the live channel, which he puts a lot of effort into just because he cares about fans who don't use Twitch like you is very sad to me. Finally, I feel embarrassed to be associated with fans like you. And this goes for everyone who has been complaining recently. The big bastard has provided 3 1/2 years of quality, entertaining, and FREE content for me and I could never even hope to pay him back for that. It is his channel and his life. He does this because he loves his fans, even ungrateful ones like yourself, and he loves gaming. Even if he wanted to delete his YouTube channel and become a live streamer completely, I wouldn't complain, even if I didn't use Twitch. Just because there is a month or so of minimum content, and most of it is Evening With Sips and Highlights, does not give you the right to disrespect him and complain like this. His life and channel doesn't revolve around a few stubborn fans. Especially ones who would say the kinds of things that have been said about him lately. He hopes that people like his videos and him, but in the end, I think the big guy would make videos for just 10 subscribers if that's all he had. We watch his videos because we love HIM, not just the boring, uninteresting, tired games like FNAF, the latest early-access survival game, or whatever else. If you just want gameplay videos, 90% of YouTube is that. If you want Sips, there is plenty of him all around. He will return with real let's plays and things to his main channel eventually. If you are so mad, you can unsubscribe and resub later. I know that it may be frustrating that he isn't doing every single thing you want, but be patient, be thankful, and most importantly, be open-minded to change and new things."
sips,3den9y,Gazeros,3,Thu Jul 16 07:01:49 2015 UTC,"I really wanted to keep my youtube and reddit accounts separate. Oh well. I'm the one that posted the youtube comment that /u/pmmeyourbootypics is complaining about.  I find it funny that when I posted the same critique (more politely worded, I'll admit) on /r/sips it got 47 points (78% upvoted). The Youtube comment is currently at 492 likes. I am clearly not alone here.  And yet people feel the need to mock and belittle other peoples' viewpoints just because they disagree.  Not everyone likes the livestream format. A lot of us don't, if the likes and upvotes are any indication. It's okay that we don't like it. We've been getting neglected for a while now. It's okay for us to make ourselves heard so that Sips knows we don't all like livestreams.  It's also okay if Sips doesn't want to cater to the Youtube crowd anymore. Eventually we'll leave if that's the decision he decides to make. That'll be a significant portion of his viewerbase gone, but that's entirely his choice, and he may make more money in the end off Twitch anyway. Can't really blame him.  That said, we're at around a month now of ""he's just busy and promised he'd do more,"" and I like Sips so I'll keep waiting to see if that's true. It's just very frustrating seeing so many games I'd like to see in Sips' traditional format go straight to livestreaming.  We all were wanting to see Sips play RDR. Now only those who watch Livestreams will. And I still argue that Livestreaming isn't watching Sips do anything. It's watching Sips plus a few thousand of his fans do something. It's not the same. At all."
sips,3den9y,Fledo,6,Thu Jul 16 08:06:24 2015 UTC,"I went ahead and screenshot the comments in question so that others have a little bit of context for your and /u/pmmeyourbootypics comment, and can judge them on their own accord and not based on others' interpretations of them.  If you re-read them again, hopefully you'll realize how whiny and immature those comments are, and if not - well, I'm not going to try to explain it to you. I'll just say that ""fuck livestreaming, I hate it"" is not a ""critique"", regardless of how much you want it to be - it's whinging. I'd like to comment on some of your more specific points:   Livestreams are bad because of Sips' personal interaction with viewers - chat, strawpolls, etc.   I don't get this at all. Direct interaction between a content creator and viewers is enjoyable for both of them. I really can't think of a reason why someone would hate it, unless they're antisocial or dislike sips paying attention to anyone but themselves.   Youtube content isn't free, youtubers get money for it   No, youtube and twitch* content is free by definition. Just because ad companies pay content producers to put advertisement on their videos doesn't mean that any viewer actively contributes to Sips' youtube income. You are not paying anything to consume sips' content, therefore it's free. He doesn't have any contractual or moral obligations to us.  Since this point of view is still quite popular among the younger youtube audience, I'll provide an analogy:  You're driving on a road. There's a billboard advertising something. Someone is paying the ad company for it. Does this mean the road is not free?  *except twitch-subscriber-only content, but that's up to individual streamers   Sips better not stream or his subscriber count and, subsequently, revenue will fall   Aside from being a thinly veiled passive aggressive threat, this is plain wrong. Sips has confirmed multiple times that videos aren't his only, nor his main source of income. I'm sure he'll do just fine without financial advice from youtube comments.   streams are bad because fans dictate how he should act   The irony is pretty obvious here, what with you trying to enforce your subjective views on video content on sips and everyone else, but regardless of that - this is no different from what happens on youtube as well. On every video there are countless comments about sips doing something ""wrong"" and that he should do something in another way. I really don't see the difference between youtube and twitch in this case - in the end, it's up to sips to choose whether he'll listen to advice from comments or from chat.   streams don't allow sips to create emergent stories and in-jokes   I suggest you watch his GTAV playthrough(I know, that's never going to happen), maybe that'll change your mind.  And no, likes on youtube or upvotes on reddit are not a proof of consensus among the viewers. I assume you know how both of these sites work(popular comments are pushed towards the top and get more exposure) and that imaginary internet points are meaningless."

sips,3den9y,tonybateman,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:33:20 2015 UTC,"I think many people are spoiled with Sips catering so much to his viewers. Everyone got their own view and opinion and many voice it like it's their birthright to have sips content [i]exactly[/i] as they want it. I've been watching Sips since Dig, and of course I also miss the old format. I miss when he made stories out of simple games and kept me company with his toaster mic. I don't really enjoy live streams myself because I feel like getting lost and forgotten among the more noisy people in chat - so I don't watch it.  But really, that's just how it is. Sips will and have to do whatever suits his interests and lifestyle these days, and this results in alot of streaming atm. Maybe it will swing the other way soon, maybe not. But there are thousands of channels to watch out there, so if the format doesn't fit - maybe time to look for an additional (not replacing) channel which suits you better.   My experience could be better, but that doesn't give me any rights. We say we want Sips? This is sips. Watch it and be happy that he's lauging his ass off and enjoying his time!

sips,3djtvs,WildTurkey81,2,Thu Jul 16 21:13:23 2015 UTC,I have no idea if he's trolling or not.  But I think with Youtubers you need to be a little oblivious. It makes for more interesting content because you as the viewer feel something about the gameplay. You then go to the comments and say something and you continue to watch the video to see them mess up and then finally succeed.  If they were an expert at it then it wouldn't nearly be as entertaining.

Honestly I don't really know what people expect him to do because he has a life outwith Youtube so he goes home after around 6pm, he records and edits content during the morning and early afternoon and then streams in the spare time that he has, plus he also doesn't stream during the weekend so he catches up with stuff during that time and if he doesn't then surely he should be allowed to spend some time with his family."

He then suddenly drops what he was doing after like 2 months and then just streams everything. When I saw him upload red dead I was so fucking happy, I was hoping that this meant a YouTube series would continue, but within 1 minute he says, lol no I'm just gonna stream the whole thing so I don't have to bother about editing or working hard to produce videos. When ever people speak about the streams they are always referred to as 'something in the background' meaning that the streams aren't entertaining enough to keep the audiences attention. I'm gonna get downvoted to shit for this, and I really don't care as long as I speak my opinion, The reason this 'toxicity' is returning to the community is because people don't like what's happened to the channel. Simple as that."
sips,3dfbtf,Frodolas,3,Thu Jul 16 11:45:41 2015 UTC,"Streams are lazy. You can stop for 10 minutes to talk to the chat and that's great - if you're on Twitch. Uploading half hour chunks to YouTube is all well and good but compared to actual YouTube content they are, simply, lazy.  The only reason Twitch exists is because of watching people live and the chat cooperation. Take both of those away and you just have low quality, low effort videos."
sips,3dfbtf,MrSamdei,3,Thu Jul 16 13:20:32 2015 UTC,"Like OP said, it's very similar to GMod days. Those were also just batch recorded and posted on a schedule. It doesn't take too long before they start to feel bland and samey because they don't have any of the personality that he used to include.  The thing is again, same as the GMod days, the numbers are really good. He's getting decent views on the live stream channel and more views for the highlight videos on the main channel too. Combining YouTube with Twitch, he's effectively triple-dipping on his streaming. I'm sure from his perspective, things couldn't be much better. And there's the community, actively dismissing anyone who prefers the old style of solo content videos as ""ZOMG TOXIC""."
sips,3dfbtf,MrSamdei,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:53:14 2015 UTC,"Yup, he's just reverted to completely lazy content now. People can talk all they want about ""having a sense of entitlement"" and ""free content"", but at the end of the day, it's Sips who will get hurt financially when his core viewers stop watching once again. I was happy when he began streaming sure, as some content does actually work very well with streaming(Cities, Poly Bridge, etc.), but the fact that he now plays story-based open-world AAA games on Twitch is really irksome.  Of course, I could be wrong, and it's quite possible that Sips makes a metric shitload of money from Twitch and Youtube combined. In that case, he's going to continue doing what he's doing, and sure he'll have some viewers less for it, and people like you and I won't get to enjoy his content anymore, but he'll probably be happy with the money he's making for far less effort."
sips,3dfbtf,Invisible-Gorilla,9,Thu Jul 16 20:18:15 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about other people, but I can't always catch the live streams. I enjoy them when I can though.  But I'm (for some reason I can't figure out) not a big fan of watching the play backs of them and can agree with the whole sentiment of wanting more actual things on the channel.  I do also, obviously, respect that this is what sips wants to do and it's still quality content. I just miss the moments with the silly sound effects and art work slammed into the video (ala the skyrim or simcity)"
sips,3dfbtf,MrSamdei,2,Thu Jul 16 00:11:51 2015 UTC,"And I get that but this is very much Sips' choice and we have to deal with whatever he decides.  However, some people are moaning and complaining that there isn't much content whereas it is just that there isn't much content that they want to watch. a lot of people want to blame sips for that and that they feel entitled, like before sips made the video telling the community that he didn't like the direction his channel was heading in and no longer cared about views and demographics and just wants to be able to enjoy his work and enjoy what he is doing."
sips,3dfbtf,PresidentBoobs,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:19:51 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah no, I definitely agree. The amount of content hasn't gone down nor has the quality. Just the amount of pre-recorded stuff, and even then that isn't bad.  It is just a lot of people who are entitled babbies."
sips,3dfbtf,Invisible-Gorilla,4,Thu Jul 16 00:37:01 2015 UTC,It is just a lot of people who are entitled babbies.   It goes both directions.

sips,3ddq3d,OllyPittabread,2,Wed Jul 15 14:46:25 2015 UTC,So how do you know if you won? Also do you get the amount that you bet if you win? What if you run out of dicks?
sips,3ddq3d,BBQCalculator,9,Wed Jul 15 15:51:45 2015 UTC,"A mod will pick the winning option and Sipsbot will announce the results. The bot will list all winners along with the amount of dicks each of them have won. If you picked the correct option, your name will show up in that list. If you bet wrong, you lose the amount of dicks you bet. If you bet right, you win a fraction of the dicks lost by the other team. That fraction is (your bet amount) / (total amount bet by winning team). In other words, the lost dicks are redistributed among the winning players. If you run out of dicks, you cannot bet. However, this shouldn't happen very often: you receive 1 dick for every 5 minutes that you're watching the stream. You also receive 1 dicks for every 30 minutes you're on the chat while the stream is offline. In practice, this means that you've already gathered a few dicks between the time the bet closes and the time the bet result is announced.   You can check your current amount of dicks by entering !dicks in the Sipsbot stream chat. When there's a bet going on, you can also enter !betting help to review what options you can bet on."
sips,3ddq3d,eqweni,3,Wed Jul 15 16:48:20 2015 UTC,"You gain dicks by being in Sips' channel while he is online or offline, when hes online you get more than offline. Usually the bet results can be seen in the chat or in the gameplay. Not sure how much you win  is determined."

They're playing a randomized version of Alpha Sapphire right now.)  I'm one of the maintainers for that script, helping to keep it working after Twitch updates their chat code (again). The stadium betting filter hides all messages starting with !. Indeed, this is general enough to catch commands for practically any Twitch chat bot.  To use it, use the filter as a JavaScript bookmarklet as explained on that page. Unfortunately, you can't have it load automatically on a stream other than TPP using Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey (unless you manually edit the script).  This is actually an interesting idea. It seems like there aren't really any good chat filter scripts for Twitch out there. This filter has quite a few features which can be useful for other streams:   One word messages / overly long messages: very often spam. Copy-pasted repetitions: can filter stuff like ""TRIANGLES! TRIANGLES! TRIANGLES!"" Slowmode helper: detects whether slowmode is active and shows a countdown to when you can send the next message. ""Mop up spilled drinks"": removes those weird Unicode characters which span multiple lines, also known as ""Zalgo"".   Right now, the script is very much geared towards the TPP stream (which options to filter command inputs, or remove the ""Misty meme""). If there's an audience for it, maybe we could make a ""light"" version of it aimed towards other Twitch streams..."

sips,3d37xx,Techblogogy,3,Mon Jul 13 16:38:48 2015 UTC,"Terraria is one of those games (much like minecraft) that gets exponentially better when you have others to play it with. Even Sips had trouble making a solo playthrough interesting, but the moment you add a player 2, you get a lot more interesting interactions with the game (and the banter during slower points in the game drastically improves).  I will say, however, that I think there's also an upper limit on how many players you can have while still keeping a flow to the gameplay and conversation.  try-hard analysis aside, Terraria's been great, would love to see more, and I'm not even ripping that much given I've got hundreds of hours in the game. Sure, they're not MLG, but they're having fun I think, and enjoying one of the best elements of the game, the exploration aspect."

sips,3d37xx,soldierofdarkness97,3,Mon Jul 13 05:33:47 2015 UTC,"I think the game doesn't even really matter that much, of course it can be a great catalyst for the rambles, but i think Team DD on a livestream would even be enjoyable when they watch grass (trees) grow, as long as they are not bored"
sips,3d37xx,Camb89,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:53:48 2015 UTC,"It was perfect for me last night.  I was busy bottling some homebrew and needed some good background and it was perfect.  I never felt like I was missing out by not being able to watch most of it, but listening to it provided so much entertainment.  I really appreciate the sips puts all the livestreams up on youtube for us plebs who can't watch it live."
sips,3d37xx,DuperSaiyan,5,Mon Jul 13 13:28:47 2015 UTC,I really hope they keep doing more as well! I'd love to see them even get as far as defeating the wall of flesh tbh. Definitely one of my favorite series yet.
