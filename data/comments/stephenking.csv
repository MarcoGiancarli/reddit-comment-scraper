stephenking,3e3slt,gamerexq,19,Tue Jul 21 19:05:35 2015 UTC,IMO it reads more like an airport crime novel than a Stephen king classic but I still liked it.
stephenking,3e3slt,themightyikari,2,Tue Jul 21 19:38:27 2015 UTC,"I agree. It's a decent novel, but it's not really standard Stephen King."
stephenking,3e3slt,Nowin,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:32:25 2015 UTC,"This is by design, as King was trying his hand at the gumshoe pulp fiction that he loved as a kid.  I thought it was OK, but not great."
stephenking,3e3slt,M5WannaBe,5,Wed Jul 22 04:20:22 2015 UTC,"I quite enjoyed it, but I agree it's not exactly emblematic of King, since it's not his typical genre.  If you want ""classic"" King, I'd recommend The Shining or Pet Sematery (which King cites as his scariest novel).  Neither of those is overlong."
stephenking,3e3slt,Grave_Girl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:05:28 2015 UTC,I also loved it

stephenking,3e3slt,malfean,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:17:30 2015 UTC,Jokey way of pointing out the lack of capitalization.
stephenking,3e3slt,malfean,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:13:06 2015 UTC,"I can't tell if they meant that they also loved the novel 'It', or if they were agreeing that they, too, loved the book 'Mr. Mercedes'."
stephenking,3e3slt,M5WannaBe,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:18:00 2015 UTC,"So far, only you have recommended Pet Sematery. Is it worth reading thst book first over Mr. Mercedes?"
stephenking,3e3slt,MarchOfThePigz,3,Wed Jul 22 05:47:27 2015 UTC,It's a fast read and there's a creepy and chilling relationship between a character and his or her parent that was well-executed and very King.   Many of the characters are relatable and that's a cornerstone of all the great King books.   This one wasn't a classic and I enjoyed Part 2 more but I'd still recommend it.
stephenking,3e3slt,amidoingthisright19,3,Tue Jul 21 19:54:22 2015 UTC,"Meh. I thought it was pretty flat overall. He's done far, far better."
stephenking,3e3slt,newredditsucks,2,Tue Jul 21 21:10:51 2015 UTC,"Yep.  And because of this, the only King that I haven't purchased at release in probably 20 years is Finders Keepers."
stephenking,3e3slt,no_capes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:45:49 2015 UTC,Not sure if you've picked it up yet or waiting for paperback or what but Finders Keepers is superior IMO

stephenking,3e3slt,NineteenthJester,2,Wed Jul 22 03:40:38 2015 UTC,"FK is superior to Mr. Mercedes, yes, but it still feels a little flat compared to his other books."

stephenking,3e3slt,amidoingthisright19,3,Wed Jul 22 00:59:29 2015 UTC,"I just felt like I was getting beat over the head with the characters and their personalities. They didn't always feel very organic, especially coming from the man that wrote It. I missed the characters like I would miss people after I finished that book."
stephenking,3e3slt,spikestoker,2,Wed Jul 22 02:19:44 2015 UTC,"It isn't necessarily a great introduction to King as a whole, as Mr. Mercedes is a crime novel, and most of his work is in the horror genre. However, someone with no King experience can readily enjoy the novel in and of itself."
stephenking,3e3slt,npotash,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:10:30 2015 UTC,"It could have used another edit. Usually I disagree when people say his books are overlong, but there were whole chapters of Mr. Mercedes I could have done without."

stephenking,3e3slt,dirtyJerz77,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:13:42 2015 UTC,I think it is a great book to delve into the world of Stephen King.   Years ago before  I started reading King I was a apprehensive because of the whole Sci-Fi / Horror genre. I read the Stand cover to cover and enjoyed it more than I have any other book. Since I've read everything I can get my hands on.

stephenking,3e3slt,DestinyTurtle,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:21:22 2015 UTC,"Mr. Mercedes was actually my first King book, and it really got me hooked on his work. Definitely not his best, but it's a really fun crime thriller, and it hooks you right off the bat. Totally worth the money."

stephenking,3e3rms,VaranusNiloticus,17,Tue Jul 21 19:18:20 2015 UTC,"Your spoiler is correct in a way, but the details are off a little bit, so you might still be surprised.    Anyway, yes, absolutely.  The journey of The Stand - like most King books - is far far better than the ending."
stephenking,3e3rms,ughalready,5,Tue Jul 21 19:14:09 2015 UTC,"Of course, yes, it's still worth reading.  If a story is so dependent on surprise that it loses all appeal once the ending is known, it's not much of a story. The Stand is about a lot more than its ending. EDIT TO ADD: Frankly, every King book is about more than its ending. Which is good, because King doesn't always stick the landing on his novels."
stephenking,3e3rms,evilgenius815,3,Tue Jul 21 19:32:20 2015 UTC,"Hahah, your edit was a great way to put it. And no, he definitely doesn't.  But yes, please read it and post your opinions. I never tire of reading reactions of new readers to his classics. :) always fun to discuss."
stephenking,3e3rms,MarchOfThePigz,3,Tue Jul 21 19:57:31 2015 UTC,"There is still quite a bit of story after that part, so I would give it a Roth Rating of 6 Tim Roths out of a possible 7.  So yes, definitely Roth it"

stephenking,3e3rms,Hugh_Jampton,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:17:04 2015 UTC,"It's well worth the read. I kind of accidentally spoiled the ending myself, but it still remains my favourite book of all time.  As for the spoiler you have, it's somewhat correct. But you are off a bit."
stephenking,3e3rms,Tia00017,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:21:14 2015 UTC,Read it. Forget the spoilers. Just fall in.
stephenking,3e3rms,sexychippy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:57:42 2015 UTC,My favorite part of the book happens after that spoiler I believe. I think they may cross over a bit. I love the re released  version the best.
stephenking,3e3rms,CaCaSp17,2,Tue Jul 21 23:13:35 2015 UTC,"I also knew the ending before I finished it, it's definitely worth finishing, it's a great book regardless of being spoiled."
stephenking,3e3rms,SangminSunbae,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:29:42 2015 UTC,"If anything, you'll appreciate it more. You can spot it coming and really appreciate the complexity a little more."
stephenking,3e3rms,666squidward,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:17:54 2015 UTC,"It's not a mystery novel.  Knowing the ending of The Stand will have absolutely no effect on how you experience the journey.  It's not like knowing the protagonist's best friend is the villain, or that some kid with great potential is going to die.  A single event got spoiled for you, and I know it's ""huge,"" but IMO, it's not really that important when it comes to actually reading the book."
stephenking,3e3o52,FlirtinMurgen,3,Tue Jul 21 18:35:23 2015 UTC,"A friend had an interesting theory about this book: that King may be planning a Part 3 which will make Abra the antagonist and Dan has to go up against her. This relates to the anger issues she demonstrates throughout Doctor Sleep and which are specifically alluded to at the end of the book.   And much like you, I felt the lack of tension in this book."
stephenking,3e3o52,b34t,4,Tue Jul 21 18:42:33 2015 UTC,I would read the shit out of that book.
stephenking,3e3o52,Tia00017,2,Tue Jul 21 20:19:38 2015 UTC,"I did catch that as it is constantly mentioned throughout the book. I think that would be interesting, but I don't see Dan winning in that scenario. He is middle aged and repeatedly says how Abra is much stronger then him and even says how she hasn't even peaked at."
stephenking,3e3o52,b34t,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:45:37 2015 UTC,"But that would be the appropriate amount of tension required for a King book - how can this old guy win against this super-powerful woman? Maybe another kid who shines?   Eh, I am just overthinking it to find excuses for the somewhat lackluster Doctor Sleep climax."
stephenking,3e3o52,agorby00,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:26:00 2015 UTC,"You're best off to pretend it's a standalone book and not a sequel to The Shining (one of my absolute favorites). Dr Sleep is...decent...in that regard. Just decent. It's obviously very well written and an entertaining book overall. But obviously we want to compare it to the vastly more complex Shining. I'll reread it just like I do all the others, but it's not one I'll turn to again and again. Cleanse your palette and go read Revival, it's one of his strongest in awhile, IMO."
stephenking,3e3o52,steeljaw,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:06:09 2015 UTC,"I second the ""Revival"" recommendation, especially if OP wants some scary shit!! When people talk about King falling off I guess I get what they're saying, but if you read Revival [I think] you will be happily surprised to see that King can still scare the shit out of you!"
stephenking,3e3o52,1015192122,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:16:51 2015 UTC,"I agree. An entertaining book, but nothing like its predecessor. The villains weren't scary, there was no real sense that the protagonists were in danger."
stephenking,3e3o52,meeyow,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:41:59 2015 UTC,"Like many of his recent novels I'm not a fan of it either. I feel so bad for saying this but a lot of his recent novels have been bleh. Someone posted here that what made The Shining and all his earlier novels so damned good was because he built up relationships, struggles, happiness, guilt, compromises, thoughts, so well with adults or children. He never explained the plot so simple and lackluster like some charlatan explaining their past, but he conveyed each characters WHOLE lives, viewpoints, justifications, feelings, etc., so fluidly with the storyt it made you feel so connected and intimate, and sympathetic to even animals like Cujo! I miss that about his writing...."
stephenking,3e0tnr,TrashCanMan407,7,Tue Jul 21 02:13:58 2015 UTC,"Ooh, I never thought of that but I'd actually love to see that too. I suppose it's not really a myth though.    If we were testing Stephen King stories, the one I'd really like to see is Dolan's Cadillac.  I've always been curious if that would really work."
stephenking,3e0tnr,Vixlari,3,Tue Jul 21 08:01:17 2015 UTC,"He certainly made it sound like it would work haha...to this day ""arc of descent"" is still one of my favorite phrases uttered"

stephenking,3dyoob,guiltyas-sin,-5,Mon Jul 20 23:00:37 2015 UTC,You call it?  No idea where that quote would have come from.  Though King reads/responds to some letters it seems really unlikely that he'd listen to phone calls.
stephenking,3dyoob,frostfromfire,18,Mon Jul 20 17:30:21 2015 UTC,"you do realize that's a joke, there's only 7 numbers where you need at least 10 to make a phone call."
stephenking,3dyoob,chillbill69,3,Mon Jul 20 17:32:30 2015 UTC,Some of us aren't familiar with American phone number conventions. Just saying. Though to be fair that's not alerted me to the possibility that this may not be real. ;)
stephenking,3dyoob,blekkja,-7,Tue Jul 21 05:40:04 2015 UTC,"I figured there would only be 7 numbers, just like there's only 7 in a regular number like 555-5555."
stephenking,3dyoob,frostfromfire,4,Mon Jul 20 20:12:14 2015 UTC,"no, there are ten numbers even in those cases, there is an unwritten area code. For example I live in Arkansas, we have two area codes (that I know of) 870 and 501. So if you just dial 555-5555, assuming that's a real number, from my house it's 870-555-5555. In little rock it's 501-555-5555. If you wanted to call someone from my house to little rock you have to dial all ten numbers (if using a land line, I think cell phones have different rules when it comes to area codes)"
stephenking,3dyoob,chillbill69,2,Mon Jul 20 20:43:42 2015 UTC,"FYI, there are 3 area codes in Arkansas.  You forgot 479, which is the Fort Smith/Fayetteville area.   Source: I live in the 479"

stephenking,3dyn8r,jp_pennypacker,6,Mon Jul 20 16:32:24 2015 UTC,"One of my favorite books of his and also the most vilified, even by SK himself. Done properly, if it was made into a movie it would win best picture. Put aside all of the reasons it was taken out of print. This book didn't cause anyone to do anything anymore than ""Doom"" caused Columbine. It is one of the best pieces of character development SK has ever written. Not to mention one of the greatest examples of the Anti-Hero since Travis Bickle. We're given Charlie, who at first we feel we have to shy away from. He's crazy as fuck we say to ourselves, this weirdo kid eating Ritz crackers to soothe his sour stomach, being called to the principal's office for hitting his teacher with a pipe wrench of all things. Crazy kid. Classic SK. Then our thoughts are confirmed when he calmly retrieves a .45 pistol from his locker, walks back to class, and shoots his teacher in the head. Once again, classic SK. Then he shuts the door and begins to speak. We hear the birthday party story. The story of sitting terrified in the tent as his father discussed the ""Cherokee Nosejob"". The sadly failed attempt at his first time with a girl. We hear stories that reflect our own fears and inadequacies and we're terrified to relate to this kid yet we do. At the same time it's juxtaposed with the stories of his classmates, each one of them abandoning who they pretend to be and realizing they are all the same. One of them refuses the change and we see what happens to him. By the end of the book Charlie has become the hero. Or Anti-Hero? That's up to you. One of my favorites of SK and sadly one of the most misunderstood. Long days and pleasant nights."

I love this because it's so raw & brutal, yet there's this soft, childishness to it that stands in such opposition to the brutality, it's absolutely captivating.   I love how Charlie's intelligence could take him anywhere, but, instead, it's lead him to Rage.

I think it would be better off as being a Netflix original where anyone can watch it without having to get cable or a satellite provider for only one channel.  Other than that I'm all for it being a television series first followed up by a movie later if they are doing the series as an introduction to the characters and back stories with the actual movie being when they get to meet Mother Abigail (for the good side) and Flagg (for the bad) and what happens afterward.

I think this is an interesting attempt, if they follow through with it. Whether or not TV views expressed of a show would directly translate to box office returns. I'm interested to see how it all works out."
stephenking,3dz0ef,bamfra,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:56:43 2015 UTC,I haven't heard of that but that's cool if they do. Still not sure if people would just buy one channel streaming when you can get a service like Netflix or Hulu for roughly the same price but you never know maybe people would.
stephenking,3dz0ef,chillbill69,2,Tue Jul 21 02:46:28 2015 UTC,"I would imagine that they'd probably release the TV portion of the project to DVD and Blu-ray as a typical box set prior to the theatrical release of the film, so even if you didn't have Showtime and didn't want to spend the money for that service, I'd imagine there would still be an opportunity to see it before the film is released.  Not sure how I feel about this particular approach, but it'll be interesting to see it unfold.  I would generally prefer an entire series like this to be entirely contained within one form of media, but this approach seems to be what the industry is shifting towards, so we'll see how it turns out."
stephenking,3dz0ef,4CES,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:10:17 2015 UTC,"A box set would work out great, yeah. I think I would probably pick up the whole set and watch them all in one sitting a few days before the movie would come out. I just hope the movie doesn't come out much longer after the episodes."
stephenking,3dz0ef,Tia00017,2,Tue Jul 21 05:06:50 2015 UTC,I think it would work better as a television show.   As long as they don't go and pull another Under The Dome.

Let some time pass. 6 months? A year?  Then read WTTK. It was a nice return to a different world that I was familiar with but I wasn't burned out on it.

Then you get a really large flashback book in Wizard and Glass. Reading  WttKH... yet another story right after WaG that is NOT about the main characters, can be daunting and may cause some to lose interest. So on a first time through I suggest WttKH last, on a re-read I sugest reading it as book 4.5"
stephenking,3dtmbl,Idirrtts,4,Sun Jul 19 15:19:02 2015 UTC,"I read Wind through the keyhole just after Wizard and Glass, but it's a lot better to read it after you've finished the series, trust me. You'll appreciate more the return in The Dark Tower"

stephenking,3dqt7z,phantomfyre,2,Sun Jul 19 02:52:30 2015 UTC,"I just recently finished The Green Mile as well, and I'm actually sort of on the fence with it. I think the overwhelming majority of it is some of King's finest writing, I think the story is emotionally gripping and intense, I think it has some truly beautifully crafted characters, and yes, I did feel something strange and indescribable after reading it.  Yet, it has some glaring problems that affect how I look at this book that's supposed to be a masterpiece.  There are some truly bizarre, and sometimes offensive, portions of the writing that simply do not match the serious tone of the novel -- if it happened once, I wouldn't mind, but I found myself rolling my eyes quite a few times and being taken out of the story. So, for example, there's a section where Paul is reflecting on the joys of writing, and compares that joy to the joy of being raped. Wait - what? Yep, makes no fucking sense. There's a couple of ""cars starting up and the muffler farted"" lines, and some seriously clunky writing here and there.   Also, I wouldn't go so far as to say the book is racist, but there are some serious problems with ethnic description, use of John Coffey's character, and the ""magical Negro"" trope to such an alarming degree that I honestly would not feel comfortable recommending this to other people. Comedian Paul Mooney once said ""I fucking hated every second of that shit,"" regarding The Green Mile; and after reading it, I think he has a point.  I have no official stance on the book quite yet, I'm kind of in the air, you know?"

I actually have The Green Mile on my top 10 favorite books from SK. As for the ""magical Negro"", I think King gave him those characteristics, qualities, powers, what have you, without any racism in his mind.   Actually there was a post here a few weeks back with an excellent essay about how Coffey represents Jesus, with all the healings, the bringing back to life to a mouse, the execution, etc."
stephenking,3dqt7z,PenguinOfBoom,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:11:45 2015 UTC,"I'm on the fence about it, too, but I think the ""magical Negro"" stuff may not actually be there. The first time I read the book I thought ""Aw, Jeez, this is very Legend of Bagger Vance."" But then I realized just how angry Coffey was, and how he basically wreaks havoc and vengeance on every other character, and I kind of feel like he winds up being a character more like one of the Greek Furies, who hounds sinners to their graves, than a magical negro."

I think the purpose of the scene wasn't really to turn them into adults though. I think it was to accentuate the concept that each of the kids had to use what made them weird, or different, or ""weak"", to beat the creature and get out of the tunnels. Bill used the speech devise, Eddie his inhaler, Stan his birds, etc. It's a bit of a stretch to use that reasoning to explain Bev having to use her femininity to bring he group back to rights, but...I don't know, that line of reasoning makes me feel better about it all for some reason."

stephenking,3djuyu,ryguy2,4,Thu Jul 16 21:21:10 2015 UTC,"I heard that Flagg is a major player in The Dark Tower series, if this is correct, how does it fit in timeline wise with The Stand?   I believe The Stand takes place in the middle of The Dark Tower series. It's hard to place, but it definitely occurs prior to book four.   So let me get this straight. Trashcan Man brought in a nuclear warhead that made Flagg turn into pure energy, go inside the bomb and detonate it?   It's been a while since I read the book, but that doesn't sound right. If I recall, it's more that Flagg creates a burst of energy which is inadvertently redirected toward the bomb, which detonates. (The energy blast, for a moment, appears to take the shape of a hand, suggesting it is the hand of God Himself that sets off the bomb.)   I plan on going through The Dark Tower series. I'm curious on the best reading order of them and have seen different opinions on this, what's your suggestion, Constant Reader?   Gotta go in order. They do tell a sequential story. I'd mix in Insomnia and The Eyes of the Dragon at some point before the end, but it doesn't really matter where.  EDIT: Actually, it is possible to start with The Drawing of the Three, but you should read The Gunslinger at some point. The Gunslinger is often a tough read, so if you find yourself drifting, feel free to skip to the second book.  EDITED AGAIN: Totally forgot about Salem's Lot. That one's pretty important to the Dark Tower, too."
stephenking,3djuyu,evilgenius815,2,Thu Jul 16 22:23:13 2015 UTC,"Ok, you're right. I just re-listened to the bomb part. The ball of energy the Flagg made, and killed a man with, grows then resembles a hand. At this point Flagg shouts ""Nooooo"" and briefly changed into something with big eyes with yellow cat pupils then he was gone. His clothes held the form of a man before collapsing onto themselves. Flagg did whisper that he was, in fact, a devil right before using the energy to kill a person.  So apparently he just vanishes. I hope this makes more sense in The Dark Tower series or Eyes of the Dragon. I like my bad guys to get their comeuppance and not just disappear!"
stephenking,3djuyu,ghost-wiener,3,Thu Jul 16 23:08:21 2015 UTC,"A few other books you may like are The Shining and IT.  Those are his ""classics"".  Also you may enjoy Eyes of the Dragon as Flagg plays a huge role in that book.   I love The Stand too it is one of my favorites."

stephenking,3djuyu,ghost-wiener,2,Thu Jul 16 23:09:37 2015 UTC,"I am just barely getting into the Dark Tower series myself , but I read Eyes of the Dragon a few times(I loved it so much!)  It is a great book on it's own, and I am sure others on here would know the connections and be more advising on the order.  It is more of a fantasy/mystical journey from King.  Happy reading and enjoy!"

I wrote 'happy reading' and I should have said enjoy the reading of King and enjoy your journey :).  I do love Eyes of the Dragon and it's just different in terms of his writing."

stephenking,3djuyu,clwestbr,2,Thu Jul 16 23:22:01 2015 UTC,"No wonder you prefer audio books ;)  I don't think it matters if you read eyes of the dragon before or after the tower. Personally I  read it after, and was psyched to have another reference to the tower.. But to me The Dark Tower is his best work, so I definitely have a bias. After finishing the series for the first time I went back through his catalog and read all of the tower related books just to get my fix.."
stephenking,3djuyu,Macievelli,3,Fri Jul 17 01:29:57 2015 UTC,"Did Mother Abagail and Leo/Joe have ""The Shine""?   Sort of. ""The Shine"" is a thing that occurs at different levels, but it appears that at least Mother Abigail did. I'm not sure on Leo/Joe, he might just be a little more feral.    I heard that Flagg is a major player in The Dark Tower series, if this is correct, how does it fit in timeline wise with The Stand?   Whooooo. Good question. It comes before Drawing of the Three, that's the best answer I can give you.   Speaking of Flagg, I heard he was really the Raggedy Man in Cell. Is this true?   Eh, its possible. Most of the time you see the initials 'RF' you've seen Randall Flagg, but the Raggedy Man seems to be more of an embodiment of the virus, a spokesperson. I don't know if he's Flagg and there isn't a solid answer.   I'm still not exactly sure why Mother Abagail went on her redemption quest for God, but she came back at the exact moment to save the others from the explosion? Why couldn't she come a minute sooner to save Nick also? I know this is the part in the book where King was stuck and used the explosion to move the book forward.   She didn't come back to save everyone from the explosion. Nick knew there was a bomb and went looking for it, but he could have stayed outside or everyone could have finished the meeting first. This is one of those examples where you can very easily see that a writer was stuck in an epic and wrote their way out of it. This case could have used some tightening.   So let me get this straight. Trashcan Man brought in a nuclear warhead that made Flagg turn into pure energy, go inside the bomb and detonate it?   No. Flagg was losing control of his ability to hide the monster he was. When he lost it completely he just went ahead and decided to display his power, but he couldn't control it. The bit of energy he released got out of his grip and it went for the nearest comparable power source (this moment is speculation) and detonated the bomb.   I plan on going through The Dark Tower series. I'm curious on the best reading order of them and have seen different opinions on this, what's your suggestion, Constant Reader?   Read IT, Salem's Lot, The Low Men in Yellow Coats, Insomnia, and then just power through the series.   What other King book should I make it a priority to read soon?   On this front I adore The Shining and consider it his best-written book. I'm also very fond of his short story collection Skeleton Crew as well as his newer novel Revival."
stephenking,3djuyu,clwestbr,2,Fri Jul 17 02:03:56 2015 UTC,"I think you'd be missing out to read Low Men in Yellow Coats without reading the rest of Hearts in Atlantis afterward.  I also think that both should be read after, not before, The Dark Tower."
stephenking,3djuyu,briny001,3,Fri Jul 17 02:16:53 2015 UTC,"I agree that Hearts in Atlantis should be read in its entirety, wonderful book. I just was aiming for stuff directly related to the DT series.   On when it should be read I'll say its been awhile, does reading it before spoil a lot? I can't remember."
stephenking,3djuyu,True_or_Folts,2,Fri Jul 17 02:18:20 2015 UTC,"No, it wouldn't really spoil anything. I just think the Low Men (and Ted himself, for that matter) will seem awkwardly odd and insignificant to someone who doesn't know about the Breakers."
stephenking,3dg9hn,ghost-wiener,14,Thu Jul 16 01:05:31 2015 UTC,"If you really want to continue your journey, I'd recommend reading a hearty synopsis of the Gunslinger and move on. There are a few plot points you'll want to have in your back pocket before continuing the series. Drawing of The Three moves at a much better pace. However, if you aren't digging it by halfway through the second book, I don't think this series is for you.  I hope this helps! Long days and pleasant nights."

By the time I finished I was really not impressed and wasn't going to continue the series. A coworker raved about the series though, so I decided one more try and picked up Drawing of the Three. So worth it!.  Keep going. It's like eating the not so tasty food first as a kid so you can get to dessert!"
stephenking,3dg9hn,SnowblindAlbino,6,Thu Jul 16 01:44:11 2015 UTC,"Let me testify brother/sister: I've been an SK fan since 1981, when I read Nightshift. I quickly grabbed everything he'd written before then and ever since have fairly religiously read each new novel as it was published.  Except The Gunslinger. I couldn't stand the first 100+ pages, tossed it aside, and despite trying again a few times never got past that point. As a result I never read any of the other DT books, thinking them more like comics or just dreadfully boring.  Fast forward to 2012: one of my kids found the entire DT series at a thrift store and bought them for me, knowing I loved SK and not recnogizing them from our shelves. I dutifully forced myself through the first book and found it got much better about 2/3 of the way in...and then got good, enough to drive me to the second book. Before you know it I had read the entire series over Christmas vacation, lost a lot of sleep along the way by staying up late reading, and realized while the DT series might not be SK's masterwork it is close.  It's worth it. Put in the effort up front and soon you'll be rewarded."
stephenking,3dg9hn,SnowblindAlbino,2,Thu Jul 16 03:31:54 2015 UTC,"That is the same for me!  I have been reading King since 1987 and The Shining scared me like crazy and since then I was hooked.  I, too, am only making it close to 100 pages in.  I am going to get through it this time because I want to see DT universe.  Thank you!"
stephenking,3dg9hn,heart_in_a_jar,2,Thu Jul 16 19:42:21 2015 UTC,I think you'll come to love it-- I was really quite sad when I finished the series. It's probably time to read it again in fact. You just have to force yourself to get through the first book.
stephenking,3dg9hn,im_not_a_writer,7,Thu Jul 16 20:02:52 2015 UTC,"Gunslinger is written in a much different style than anything else King has done and it can be difficult to get through. But once you get to The Drawing of Three, it's classic King again. So maybe... Read the wiki about The Gunslinger and move on to book 2."
stephenking,3dg9hn,Soularbowl,2,Thu Jul 16 01:14:49 2015 UTC,"Awesome! Thank you!  You are the second person to suggest this so I thin this is what I will do. Also, thank you for understanding with it being written in a different tone"

stephenking,3dg9hn,sexychippy,2,Thu Jul 16 03:27:41 2015 UTC,"This was the same problem that I had with starting the series as well.  I tried a few months ago to make my way through ""The Gunslinger"" but it's still sitting on the shelf unfinished."

stephenking,3dg9hn,city17_dweller,2,Thu Jul 16 11:08:31 2015 UTC,"I think I've tried twice and simply wasn't very fond of it. Typically his books capture me pretty early, even if I judge the premise to be stupid (like Christine) and I'll still end up loving it! Not The Gunslinger though, it felt like a chore. Thought I was a very small minority, but it doesn't seem to be that way.   Everyone keeps talking about The Drawing of Three (I believe), is that the second book? How many are there total now?"
stephenking,3dg9hn,Tychoxii,2,Thu Jul 16 14:54:19 2015 UTC,"This seems crazy to me to see all of these people down on The Gunslinger.  That is one of my favorite books of all time.  Although there are better books in the series, The Gunslinger is still my favorite because it introduces us to Roland, Ka, Gunslingers, Jake, Other Worlds, and everything that makes this series great.  ""The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed."" This is where it started for me, and I can't imagine not reading it as an introduction to the world."
stephenking,3dg9hn,psychoda,2,Thu Jul 16 15:55:25 2015 UTC,"I started with drawing of the three and it sucked me in. Then went back and read gunslinger to fill in the gaps. By book three, I was in for the long haul."
stephenking,3dg9hn,Damien__,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:57:14 2015 UTC,"It's a pity you didn't get on with it well enough to plow through.  I think it's excellent in it's own right, but not getting into it is no reason not to try book 2.  Book 1 is sort of a character introduction; as long as you come out of it with the taste of dry, relentless quest in your throat, you have everything you need to keep going.  Plotwise, two essential meetings and one fateful choice happen over the course of that book, but these are all referred to with plenty of exposition where needed in the next book(s)."
stephenking,3dg9hn,Canadamatt2230,2,Thu Jul 16 09:47:48 2015 UTC,Maybe it's just me but I plan on plugging through it. It just didn't capture me like other King books/short stories. I know when I make it through I will be into the DT world so that's what keeps me going!
stephenking,3dg9hn,Damien__,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:34:50 2015 UTC,"Book two is a lot more engaging; Roland may still be an uptight stick, but the others characters don't let him get away with it.  He has to interact with exasperation, concern, interest etc, where he was all about stoic dryness in book 1."
stephenking,3dg9hn,Mrslinger85,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:54:21 2015 UTC,"I had the same problem, I dropped the book like halfway through, something I have only done with like two books.

stephenking,3dg9hn,KHcactus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:18:11 2015 UTC,The Gunslinger is a short book and should be considered a sort of prologue to the series. If you can force yourself through it you will be glad you did but it is a bit dry at least compared to the rest of the books. Warning this is a fantasy series with horror elements. Almost nothing about it is even remotely a western. That was what was holding me back my first time trying to read it.
stephenking,3dg9hn,Idirrtts,2,Thu Jul 16 15:22:43 2015 UTC,"Almost the entirety of book 4 is a Western in the traditional sense.   I encourage people to read The Gunslinger, but if they are having trouble to just skip to The Drawing of the Three. Its a fine start for the series, but book one is important as it introduces a couple of key characters in later books, and its sometimes easier to get into it after finishing TDotT, as if that book doesnt suck you in, nothing will."

In The Dark Tower VII: The Dark Tower, Rando Thoughtful tells Roland that before killing himself, the Crimson King smashed the rest of the Bends in his possession - presumably so that no one else could have them, or out of thoughtless anger. However it is possible that this is a lie as in The Long Road Home we see the Pink Bend smashed by Roland's bullets but reforms after attacking Roland in its demon form."

I'd totally recommend getting back into it! Have you read both the original Gunslinger & the revised? if not, i'd definitely say get your hands on the other copy. Each version sets the tone for the story a bit differently & it's neat to have both perspectives.  Also, I had never listened to an audio book before I listened to TDT series, but it's friggan awesome to hear Steve, Frank Muller & George Guidall tell you the tale.  And don't forget to grab a copy of ""Wind through the Keyhole"" too! It really doesn't have shit to do with TDT, but it's wedged in there quite nicely & is a really great story. Plus, who could pass up another of Rolands stories from his younger years??? Not me, Sai, not me.  Ok, I'll stop rambling now, or I'll never stop.   Long days and pleasant nights on your trail"
stephenking,3dau1d,mmmmpork,4,Tue Jul 14 22:53:38 2015 UTC,"I think that Guidall's doesn't even compare to the work Muller did on the earlier stories. He's not bad, but Muller was a genius. He captured the voices."
stephenking,3dau1d,apikoros18,5,Tue Jul 14 23:30:58 2015 UTC,"I agree that Frank Muller is a complete genius when it comes to making the characters come alive, but I'd say that I enjoyed George Guidall's reading too. I think he gave a different dimension to the tale, almost a slight light heartedness, that Muller didn't quite capture.   I will say, it'd have been amazing to hear Muller read the entire series on his own. I think that if anybody could have picked it up though, it was Guidall.\  And how do you feel about Steve reading his own works? At first I found his voice hard to listen to and I felt like he was reading everything in monotone. I've listened to him narrate a few different stories now, and I think he's growing on me. I think his readings of TDT series are some of his worst. Which kind of sucks, because I think TDT is some of his best story telling."
stephenking,3dau1d,mmmmpork,3,Wed Jul 15 00:51:18 2015 UTC,"I think King should stick to writing... not reading. However, I do like hearing his vision of how to pronounce words. I had a cassette of him reading a few short stories. When he did the voice of the waiter in Lunch at the Gotham Cafe, it was, very very rough. Its not the Maine accent, or the monotone... its he isn't a voice artist, is all. I like when he cameos in films based on his work... but he isn't the best actor, either."

I read every single one within a month of release, and then, starting with Wolves of The Callas the DAY of release... I have re-read them at least once a year since then... My feeling is the quote from Nietzsche:""When you look into the abyss, the abyss looks into you""--- By which I mean, the books may not change but I change. I get different meanings, I feel different things, I feel the same thing, but sometimes more deeply (and sometimes less) and, well, each read is its own experience. For a long time, I felt wizard and glass was the weakest... now, its my favorite. I dunno, I changed.  I will stand by the scariest scene being when the city of Lud descends into chaos, and the people waiting on line to be stamped.  Anyway, I have read all of Mr. King's published work (and the occasional unpublished such as the shining prologue), and DT is still my fave.   YMMV"

stephenking,3d9lob,KicksButtson,3,Tue Jul 14 20:42:30 2015 UTC,I was brought up/still live fairly near to the real life Crouch End - it made the whole story so much more creepy to me because I can totally picture the streets and feel the vibe.  I always wondered how on earth Stephen King was even aware of a tiny part of North London and eventually found out he had been there whilst visiting Peter Straub. Still can't believe my favourite author had been so near to where I grew up.
stephenking,3d9lob,spl1ced,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:26:22 2015 UTC,"When I read that story I pictured the very narrow streets, brick paved roads, and old turn of the century London architecture.

Which is more true?"

I would suggest looking for Crouch Hill on Google Maps and the streets around the parkland walk, but you might find it a bit mundane compared to your imagination so I don't want to kill it for you.  (EDIT) Google the Parkland Walk Spriggan - as apparently this was part of King's inspiration"

My favorite part of the short story is the lead up to entering the room, where the hotel manager explains the room's notorious history.   The best part after he enters the room is when he turns to look at the door and sees it's canted slightly to the left, which he thinks is worth noting on his tape recorder so he turns to get it and when he turns around to look back at the doorway he sees its actually canted slightly to the right.

stephenking,3d5vj3,Zendub,6,Mon Jul 13 23:03:06 2015 UTC,"I'm starting to think a ""Game of Thrones"" style HBO or Netflix series would do the books the most justice. The whole ""movies and a companion series"" idea is a bit confusing, and to just make three or four movies would mean cutting out a whole lot (@~3 hours per movie were talking 9-12 hours of film). An HBO series could run 10 seasons and give us 100+ hours of The Dark Tower.   Though I suppose if the movies covered the main quest, while the series told Roland's backstory (wizard and glass, wing through the keyhole, etc.) it could be cool."

stephenking,3d5vj3,voxangelikus,3,Mon Jul 13 23:58:27 2015 UTC,The right combination of films and television series is the optimal way to tell the full story of The Dark Tower. And not an ABC or CBS miniseries either. It has to be a cable series where you can be raw and mature and use bad language as necessary. The main sticking points that I see are how do you present such an expanse of story and what actors will be used?. Which parts will go where? I always thought a Gunslinger movie followed by a series that alternates with three main movies. There are so many options.   And I know it's a minor thing and a personal preference but I hope they get Anthony Hopkins for Ted Brautigan.

There were lots of stories -- mine included -- that were about borrowing books from a parent, usually between the ages of 10 or 12. And this may be a broad generalization, but I think anybody who was pilfering grown-up horror books from their parents at that age knows what it's like to be dumped on and spit at for what they like. I can see a person like that growing up without the usual ""NO SHUT UP YOU'RE SO STUPID"" attitude we so often run into on the internet, and especially in a place like this sub, where the only thing that brings us together is that we were all, at one point, that same twelve-year-old pulling a book off a shelf.

stephenking,3d7dlh,hohmeisw,4,Tue Jul 14 05:43:20 2015 UTC,"The ""shape"" is the entity otherwise referred to as ""the management"" by the ghosts of the Overlook in the novel.

It failed to do this, which is why once the Overlook is destroyed it's only a wispy form in the air. The fact that it looks like an animal makes me think of Tak.

When I was 12, I asked if I could read Pet Sematary, having been intrigued by the cover (""IS IT POSSIBLE FOR A STORY TO SCARE EVEN STEPHEN KING HIMSELF? IT IS POSSIBLE...AND THIS IS THAT STORY!""). She thought about it for a moment, but ultimately said no. She thought the book was a little too dark for me. Plus, she said, if I read that book first, I might thing all King books were that scary. So she loaned me Different Seasons, saying I could read the others if I liked it. I've been a Constant Reader ever since."

The Shining caught my eye because I'd seen the movie before. Indecisive as I was though I put it back and walked around the store some more. I came upon a book called 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die and figured I'd look through it for some ideas. The first page I opened to was about The Shining by Stephen King. I stood there and said to myself well that settles it then.

Like what if you buried Jeffery Dahmer there?  Would they become even more evil or maybe there would be an opposite effect and they'd become good Jeffery Dahmer?

stephenking,3d02y0,stop_saying_content,2,Sun Jul 12 13:12:21 2015 UTC,"I was there through the waiting. I read The Wastelands when it first came out, and waited years for the next one. Then waited years for the one after that. In the times between releases, I reread the ones that had been released. The Gunslinger was the perfect afternoon read, and I read it probably 20 times altogether. When the final book came out, I took months to read it, because I didn't want it to be over. Once I finally finished the series, I was devastated. I now knew the story. There wasn't any more coming as there had been for over a decade. I felt a little lost for awhile. It kind of changed the way I saw the world, because now I didn't have this to look forward to anymore. I was so personality invested in the story that it left a hole when it ended. I think part of the reason is because of the waiting, but most of it is because I loved the characters.  So, yes. I think the series is the best one I've ever read and recommend them every chance I get. Some find the first book a little difficult, but it is pretty short. Some say the second is where the series finds its voice, and I don't completely disagree, but each book has its own feel and its own voice.   Do it. Just do it. If you don't like the first one, know the second is quite a bit different, and the third even more so. And the last couple in the series move so quickly, they almost feel rushed at times."

I would be fine with it at a $1.99 price point. I am not yet the ""Constant Reader"" but have gotten through 13 of King's books the past year and I feel Drunken Fireworks was a waste of time, but mostly money."
stephenking,3cxisg,ryguy2,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:31:40 2015 UTC,I was going to get it until I saw the price verse how long the book is.  $9 for 1.5 hrs isn't worth it to me.  There's another big author that puts out the occasional short story like that and either the book is free or it's less than $5 which is much more reasonable.

stephenking,3cv5v1,mooop22,3,Sat Jul 11 07:21:20 2015 UTC,"On one hand, I'd be excited just because I hype way too much for anything King-related, but on the other hand, I really don't think that a sequel needs to be written. The conflict was resolved, the story actually had a mostly satisfying ending, unlike some books that I could mention -coughCellcough-, and I honestly don't see what he could expand upon. In all honesty, I don't think that The Shining should have had a sequel, either. I wanted to know what happened to Danny as much as anyone, but Dr. Sleep is one of my least favorite King books of all time. It has a forced feeling about, which I'm absolutely positive that an unnecessary It sequel would also possess. But of course, I would read it anyway."

stephenking,3cv5v1,jefferyffe,4,Sat Jul 11 06:00:48 2015 UTC,"If it was just as big, and had a new set of characters, I'd love it.   Just have some kids in the 80`s experiencing their own personal encounters with a learning offspring of It (and if you go by the feeding time frame, they would be due a 'reunion' around now.)  That may be similar to the original in the approach, but that fits in with King's 'Ka is a wheel', what has happened before will happen again.   The difference could be the age of the new monster - if it's young, it's powers would not be as developed, so as it is still developing, it would have to resort to different methods. With the 'current era' chapters, have the monster distort reality via social media - draw / invite victim's to isolated areas via a fake Twitter invite. Catfishing with a fatal outcome."

Detective Natalie Deepneau and an elderly Joe Wyzer investigate the murder of Mike Hanlon (it was Pennywise/The Crimson Queen!). Easy."
stephenking,3cv5v1,selfabortion,2,Tue Jul 14 18:45:39 2015 UTC,"Bingo. Putting Natalie in there would be badass, mixing It with Insomnia like that would make it one of his potentially best novels IMO if he can pull it off right. We need to Twitter bomb him with this idea. :P"

stephenking,3cv5v1,Tia00017,2,Wed Jul 15 15:31:57 2015 UTC,This crossed my mind as I finished reading the book for the first time an hour or so ago. A cool premise could be one of ITs spider babies surviving and resuming the cycle except with a different methodolgy (due to lack of IT's own natural history) and the loser's returning to fight it as eldery people. We've had them fight IT while dealing with childhood then middle age but I feel tapping into a brand new IT-esque monster combined with the battles and insecurities of old age/life drawing to a close could be interesting.  Like a cross between 'Batteries Not Included and IT' maybe?

stephenking,3ct6kh,ZakMcKrakken,2,Fri Jul 10 17:54:11 2015 UTC,Definetly one of his more terrible endings (as in the feeling it leaves you)
stephenking,3ct6kh,bmwhd,2,Fri Jul 10 18:12:25 2015 UTC,"Gerald's Game. Mostly because it started with 2 people, just living regular lives and turned into something horrible with no help from the supernatural or anything like that. Just a series of events. The idea that everyone's life is open to that- it only takes one thing happening at a certain time to cause such and unthinkable situation. And most of us aren't even aware of how thin that line is between it being just another day and death, or something else so terrible that it's never entered our mind."

I'm excited to start this series. But, I worry that itl lose me eventually. I say this because while I love the Gunslinger, I've read that they get more and more ""out there"", and that the first one is almost normal compared to the rest. I've really enjoyed The Gunslinger. I hope I can stay focused and not get lost.   Shelf looks great man"

I love the gunslinger, who can forget the shootout at Tull and the first meeting between Roland and the man in black, but it's also the slowest book in many ways. The series peaks with the fourth book and it's the last three that start to get more 'out there'. If you get stuck or need a break, check out the comic series which takes place between four and five pretty much. It's worth seeing it through to the end but remember that's it about the journey as much as the destination. Enjoy"

I'm not much of a fantasy reader, so the introduction to these ""other worlds"" was difficult for me to digest. The second half, however, was a breeze. 4 days later, I'm 150 pages away from finishing The Drawing of the Three. Absolutely fucking hooked. The character development is some of King's best so far."

The two books mirror each other in odd ways, and The Regulators is so batshit loco that those connections to Desperation can ground the read a little bit."
stephenking,3cpe9e,evilgenius815,6,Thu Jul 9 20:05:43 2015 UTC,I'd try Desperation because The Regulators is actually the only King book I've ever put down.

I was underwhelmed by both of them tbh, I consider The Regulators to be one of his weakest books. Just my opinions of course, I don't know how others feel about them."
stephenking,3cpe9e,shlam16,2,Thu Jul 9 18:34:30 2015 UTC,"I agree, they were definitely not his best. I think one of the reasons is that the main evil presence in both books feels a bit ""disjointed"" when compared to those in his regular novels... is sort of unclear how much danger the main characters are in or what the limits and objectives of Tak are."

stephenking,3cpioc,sleepyhollow_101,2,Thu Jul 9 19:06:24 2015 UTC,I always mentally nitpick stories on nosleep and often finish with a not significant sour taste. I enjoyed yours. The nice blend of Annie and Eminem's Stan. I like to imagine AJ's mother was one of the first victims before she branched out.
stephenking,3cpioc,Hypnyp,3,Fri Jul 10 02:43:09 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm really glad you liked it!  To be honest, I've never actually heard Stan. :/ But I'll definitely have to listen to it now… haha.  I definitely poured in a lot of Misery references, as that was my first (and one of my favorite) King book!"
stephenking,3cpioc,Hypnyp,2,Fri Jul 10 03:18:10 2015 UTC,"I recommend the music video for a better experience. :P Misery is a great book made better with knowledge of the mindset King was in while writing it. Last Rung on the Ladder will always be my number 1 short story. I'm not sure I picked up on the references you dropped, aside from being his number one fan. The lady floating made me think of Pennywise."
stephenking,3cpioc,ThatGermanFella,2,Fri Jul 10 03:24:55 2015 UTC,"Hmm... Love your stories, very well written.  The only thing I can't get out of my mind is: If you'd have left a little bit more time, perhaps a year, between the murder and the second letter, we could have had the chance to know what car Annie has... I keep imagining something similar to Christine from the looks..."
stephenking,3cnht5,i_am_randy,10,Thu Jul 9 07:29:46 2015 UTC,"I know this isn't one that you listed, but I read On Writing for a college course before I had read any of his other works. I was so interested in his personal story and the way he describes his own writing style that I felt compelled to read a few of his novels, and he quickly became one of my favorite authors. Plus, it's short and easy to read."
stephenking,3cnht5,mikeSTWA,2,Thu Jul 9 07:32:21 2015 UTC,I hadn't considered that. I do rather like On Writing. I'll think it over. thank you!
stephenking,3cnht5,jotaesethegeek,7,Thu Jul 9 07:57:11 2015 UTC,So...of those three?  11/22/63.  Wizard and Glass is the fourth book in a series. It can stand alone...but is much better as part of the series. (It's also my least favorite DT books.)  Hearts in Atlantis is the same. It is good...but better if you are more well versed in DT.  I would go with 11/22/63.   There are other good ones to start with but it depends what else they like.   That is the thing with Sai King....he doesn't write one genre (nar-it could be said that the Dark Tower transcends all genres.) I think what is important is what types of books/movies does your friend enjoy?   Because I could see Eyes of the Dragon...IT...11/22/62....Duma Key...The Stand and many more as a good starting spot.   Not The Tommyknockers or Cycle of the Werewolf. No one should be required to suffer like that.
stephenking,3cnht5,Anichula,5,Thu Jul 9 12:44:56 2015 UTC,"Aw, The Tommyknockers wasn't that bad, I suppose it is an acquired taste though.   As for OP, I would maybe start your friend off with something a little shorter. All those books are heavy reads, maybe introduce them to some of his short story collections....? This way they will get a taste of the King spectrum. I would personally suggest Different Seasons or Four Past Midnight."
stephenking,3cnht5,jotaesethegeek,4,Thu Jul 9 14:46:15 2015 UTC,The Mist. The Mist is STELLAR!
stephenking,3cnht5,NoOrdinaryRabbit19,2,Thu Jul 9 16:03:21 2015 UTC,"Rereading The Mist right now, can confirm.  I forgot how good that novella is."
stephenking,3cnht5,curiousofothers,6,Fri Jul 10 16:01:50 2015 UTC,Oh man. Duma Key is so good! It replaced Bag of Bones as my favorite King ghost story.
stephenking,3cnht5,Jatsala,2,Thu Jul 9 14:46:37 2015 UTC,"I started reading Tommyknockers in 8th grade and I'm 35 now, still haven't finished that awful book.

stephenking,3cnht5,topher2012,8,Thu Jul 9 16:58:32 2015 UTC,"Actually I would recommend that you start with the Shining. That was my first King book, and after that I haven't been able to put his books down."
stephenking,3cnht5,frostfromfire,3,Thu Jul 9 14:59:46 2015 UTC,I agree. That was my first and it hooked me. That was about a year ago and I've read about 20 more of King's books since then.
stephenking,3cnht5,Jatsala,2,Thu Jul 9 15:08:13 2015 UTC,"I'd hesitate recommending this if OP's friend is a fan of Kubrick's film.  The Shining is one of my favorite movies so when I finally read the book it felt silly and lackluster compared to the madness in the film.  I'm sure I would have really enjoyed the book had I never seen the movie, but the film ruined it for me."
stephenking,3cnht5,HungryMoblin,2,Thu Jul 9 15:16:01 2015 UTC,"Really? That surprises me, because I did the same thing, and that only made the book better for me. But I suppose to each their own."
stephenking,3cnht5,madmidget,5,Thu Jul 9 15:17:51 2015 UTC,"The movie actually felt like the worse of the two for me, after reading The Shining. I didn't empathize with Jack at all in the film, but my heart really went out to him in the book."
stephenking,3cnht5,icanhearpudding,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:12:14 2015 UTC,"Wow, I thought the exact opposite, I thought the movie seemed silly and shallow in comparison to the book, the book felt a lot more serious to me."
stephenking,3cnht5,HungryMoblin,6,Sun Jul 19 10:07:57 2015 UTC,"Cujo never gets enough love in this type of question. Its the sum of early pure-horror King as well as the beginnings of the angry 80s Bill Hicks version of King. It also has some of his best marriage relationship-trouble moments, represented by both an upper middle and lower class couple.   You can feel the frantic, manic, auto-hypnotic writing that i mostly attribute to Drawing of Three. Except unlike DoT, Cujo is a nice standalone that also is early enough to still have that early King horror. Cujo is the quintessential King."
stephenking,3cnht5,meeyow,2,Thu Jul 9 14:03:02 2015 UTC,"Cujo is such an excellent book. Thinking back to it makes me feel sick, even a year or two later."
stephenking,3cnht5,sealless,2,Thu Jul 9 19:14:08 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with Cujo!!! I would recommend an early King like Cujp or The Shining, just because he nails relationships between adults and children, one takes you out of Maine, and both exemplify his frantic, inner thought, style. I honestly can't wrap my mind around his later novels. I read the sequel to The Shining, but it felt quick and easy. As if he's laying out the characters, they do stuff, aaaannd the end."

stephenking,3cnht5,sprahbar,3,Thu Jul 9 19:13:11 2015 UTC,"Hard to answer that one, mate. All I can tell you is, the first time I read it, the note at the end absolutely destroyed me, like very few books have ever done."
stephenking,3cnht5,evilgenius815,2,Thu Jul 9 19:39:16 2015 UTC,This right here is exactly why it made the short list.
stephenking,3cnht5,frostfromfire,2,Thu Jul 9 20:51:04 2015 UTC,"Think I'm going to have to dig this out for a re-read, now."
stephenking,3cnht5,AncientGonzo,3,Fri Jul 10 05:34:14 2015 UTC,My first King book was Rose Madder. Not a particularly great introduction to King's work but I loved it all the same.
stephenking,3cnht5,cliffyfrolk30,3,Thu Jul 9 13:12:32 2015 UTC,"Out of those three, I'd go with 11/22/63. It's the longest of the three, and it's actually the weakest of the three (I feel), but it's the only one that's self-contained. Wizard and Glass is, as you said, a book-long origin story that could be utterly baffling without the first three books. And Hearts in Atlantis leans on its Dark Tower connections, too, at least in ""Low Men in Yellow Coats.""  But really I'd go with 11/22/63 because it's the most ""Stephen King"" of the books. The other two are kind of outliers in his canon, books aren't quite like anything else he's written. If you're trying to introduce someone to the work, I'd go with the one that's most representative of what you'd expect from a King novel."
stephenking,3cnht5,HungryMoblin,2,Thu Jul 9 14:51:37 2015 UTC,"Definitely wouldn't start with Wizard & Glass because the story has more of an impact when the reader has already been on part of the Dark Tower journey with Roland.  With what's left, I'd recommend 11/22/63 because King's longer books are his best works, imo.    Do you have to choose out of these 3?  If you don't own his other books to lend out, you can have him pick up another book from the library.  I'd recommend The Stand for someone who has never read him before because it has everything that fans love in one of his books: character development, terror, fate, and unique scenarios."
stephenking,3cnht5,NoOrdinaryRabbit19,2,Thu Jul 9 15:13:08 2015 UTC,always the go with the tower...always.
stephenking,3cnht5,mrsillywhiskers,2,Thu Jul 9 16:44:49 2015 UTC,"I would start with a shorter classic King (The Shining, Pet Sematary, or Cujo are good ones) or some of his short story collections (Everything's Eventual is my personal favorite).  I feel like this would allow someone to see what King is all about without dedicating themselves to 600+ pages from the start. P.S. Wizard and Glass is my favorite book in the Dark Tower series and one of my favorite King works overall, but i would wait to read it after reading 1-3."
stephenking,3cnht5,NoOrdinaryRabbit19,2,Thu Jul 9 18:43:21 2015 UTC,"I would say none of them. I would start on Nightmares and Dreamscapes for a hard dose of King in manageable amounts. Or if you're looking for a novel, Misery is a fantastic way to start in my opinion. It's got such great pacing, and it's not terribly long. Really shows what King can do in confined spaces. No matter what you decide I wouldn't recommend Wizard/Hearts."
stephenking,3ckoah,evilgenius815,8,Wed Jul 8 17:36:34 2015 UTC,"Revival had a lot of superfluous story and character building, in my opinion. It took so long to get to the actual creepy parts...I think it would have been more tense and interesting as a short story."
stephenking,3ckoah,rock3raccoon,3,Wed Jul 8 20:54:45 2015 UTC,"While I can agree with that sentiment, the lengthiness of the story was kind of the point. If I remember correctly, King said it was written as a sort of homage to Lovecraft. Revival has a very Lovecraft-ian cadence.  EDIT - I found the quote.   ""I wanted to write a balls-to-the-wall supernatural horror story, something I haven't done in a long time. I also wanted to use Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos, but in a new fashion, if I could, stripping away Lovecraft's high-flown language."""
stephenking,3ckoah,thejonnyMAGNUM,2,Wed Jul 8 21:13:19 2015 UTC,"The only Lovecraft story that I've read is The Call of Cthulu, which is a short story. The story is written in a biographical first-person context, but it also reads a bit like Dracula, in that it's meant to be informational...like a journal, documenting events in a methodical way. It was disturbing and creepy to me because he made the events seem real, like he was simply stating the facts, and I got the sense that there was some underlying darkness behind every detail; I suppose with a short story, you have to make very good use of space and make every sentence count.   It seemed like Revival just dragged on, without enough tension. I enjoyed the writing, for sure, but it just didn't feel like a horror story until the very end...all the events leading up to the end seemed very benign and non-threatening, and it didn't seem like the ending really paid off."
stephenking,3ckoah,rock3raccoon,3,Wed Jul 8 21:23:21 2015 UTC,"What I think he was implying is how Lovecraft typically had a long draw until the end, hence why Revival seemed to drag on a bit with inklings of events that ultimately led up to a big reveal."
stephenking,3ckoah,thejonnyMAGNUM,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:19:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can see where you're coming from with that. I just was comparing (maybe unfairly) this novel with his other novels, and I came away a bit disappointed. I mean...ants?"
stephenking,3ckoah,rock3raccoon,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:12:57 2015 UTC,"That wasn't all. There was a lot more going on in there, and it was mentioned. The creatures, Mother, all of it."

stephenking,3ckoah,thejonnyMAGNUM,3,Thu Jul 9 00:54:33 2015 UTC,"I agree with you.  It was a fairly short novel to have that much filler in it.  With King's description of it as ""balls to the wall horror"" I was really hoping/expecting for something more."
stephenking,3ckoah,Grave_Girl,2,Wed Jul 8 22:37:39 2015 UTC,"Absolutely! The first 90% of the book is just character development and feels more like a Forrest Gump kind of story. The last 10% of the story was actually scary, but after so much unnecessary filler it really fell flat."
stephenking,3ckoah,KicksButtson,8,Thu Jul 9 11:10:18 2015 UTC,"Cujo.  There's just not enough to that novel to justify it being a novel.  I know it was just discussed here recently, but geez, all that random crap about the advertising business could have just gone.  I know King has said he doesn't remember writing that novel, and frankly I think it's obvious from the book."
stephenking,3ckoah,Grave_Girl,4,Wed Jul 8 22:37:04 2015 UTC,"The Dark Half.  Maybe a novella rather than a short story, but Stark bored me to tears in no time.  And I felt it never really... Went anywhere.  No twist.  No intriguing conclusion.  It ends exactly the way you'd expect, and maybe if he'd have cut most of the crap out it would have been interesting."
stephenking,3ckoah,LastArmistice,5,Thu Jul 9 06:40:39 2015 UTC,"On the flip side I wish The Ten o Clock people was a novel. I want to see how the war on the batmen was fought and how it all turned out.   EDIT: Just found out this story has been made into a movie. From Wikipedia,   In May 2011 Making Ten O'clock Productions acquired the rights to adapt ""The Ten O'Clock People"" into a feature film, which is scheduled to be released in 2015 and will star Jay Baruchel"

stephenking,3ckoah,cliffyfrolk30,5,Wed Jul 8 19:59:35 2015 UTC,Gerald's Game.  One page.
stephenking,3ckoah,newredditsucks,10,Wed Jul 8 19:52:22 2015 UTC,I feel like one of the only people that really enjoyed the length and suspense
stephenking,3ckoah,chdeks,3,Wed Jul 8 20:43:08 2015 UTC,I LOVED Gerald's Game. It was intensely disturbing. I'll never understand how someone could not like it.
stephenking,3ckoah,TotallyNot_MikeDirnt,2,Wed Jul 8 21:18:00 2015 UTC,I really loved it too. Hard to think of a more disturbing King novel IMO.
stephenking,3ckoah,BlackArtsTattooer,3,Wed Jul 8 22:48:26 2015 UTC,It easily disturbed me more than any other.
stephenking,3ckoah,SnapeWho,3,Thu Jul 9 03:41:06 2015 UTC,"I did enjoy it for the most part, the creepiness of the person and not knowing if it was in her head or not was great but I wouldn't count it as my favourite.  I can't quite put my finger on why though."
stephenking,3ckoah,tisteegz,2,Thu Jul 9 04:34:56 2015 UTC,"I want Gerald's Game to be one of my favorites, but you're right, there's something off about it"
stephenking,3ckoah,chdeks,4,Thu Jul 9 05:54:41 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I love ""IT"" but there is a ton of filler in that novel. Some of it is good and some of it is just an unnecessary addition to an already long novel. I'd like to see King do a series of ""IT"" related short stories of people's experiences in Derry where Pennywise played a role. Just a bunch of creepy experiences where the narrator mentions there was this weird clown there and they don't know why, just like in all the stories the town elders tell in the novel."
stephenking,3ckoah,KicksButtson,6,Wed Jul 8 20:17:53 2015 UTC,"That's what I wish The Tommyknockers was -- just a loose collection of stories about a weirdo town. There are lots of great, creepy pieces that would work wonderfully on their own. Stringing them all together in a bloated, endless novel didn't work at all."
stephenking,3ckoah,I-am-so_S-M-R-T,4,Wed Jul 8 20:25:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have to agree. Damn that book dragged on"
stephenking,3ckoah,tisteegz,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:14:33 2015 UTC,"I think that would be great, I agree I enjoyed the book but it did take me a lot of effort to read it all."
stephenking,3ckoah,ughalready,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:36:48 2015 UTC,Dreamcatcher probably.  It felt like such an IT retread with the flashbacks to the main characters when they were kids in Derry.
stephenking,3cikhn,BellaTrixter,19,Wed Jul 8 04:42:46 2015 UTC,"I love Dreamcatcher for how balls-out insane it is (and Duddits is just the best), but it completely falls apart at the end. It's like King himself couldn't decide exactly what the real nature of the aliens was -- and then we get a desperately expository epilogue that doesn't even explain anything."
stephenking,3cikhn,stop_saying_content,6,Wed Jul 8 05:13:18 2015 UTC,I still think the end was pulse poundingly intense. For all of its shortcoming I couldn't stop turning the pages. I cared about these characters and wanted to see them through.
stephenking,3cikhn,Neptulius,9,Wed Jul 8 06:24:00 2015 UTC,"According to Wikipedia, King has admitted he has problems with it:  ""In 2014, King told Rolling Stone that ""I don't like Dreamcatcher very much,"" and stated that the book was written under the influence of Oxycontin."""
stephenking,3cikhn,Low_Man_n_Yella_Coat,4,Wed Jul 8 12:10:10 2015 UTC,Makes me wonder what he was on when he wrote Bag of Bones.
stephenking,3cikhn,evilgenius815,6,Wed Jul 8 23:56:50 2015 UTC,"A few reasons, I think:   It feels pretty derivative in a lot of places. The band of childhood friends using the power of Childhood Magic to defeat an unstoppable evil, the megalomaniacal evil military man, the special needs child with mysterious magical powers -- these are elements that many, many other stories (several written by King himself) have used, and most to better affect. As /u/stop_saying_content said elsewhere, the story is balls-out insane. There's generally a limit to how much suspense an audience/reader is willing to suspend, and Dreamcatcher is over the line for a lot of people. It's one thing to write a novel about an alien invasion; it's one thing to write a novel about five old friends with various, mysterious psychic powers. It's another to write a novel about an alien invasion in a world where mysterious psychic powers also exist for some reason. (The movie's completely ridiculous ending is an attempt to make this disparity work, actually.) Plot-wise, it's a mess. As King himself noted, he was pretty doped up on painkillers when he wrote this book, and it shows in how sloppy the pacing is (and how muddled the novel gets as it nears the ending). And finally, it's just gross. I know that's a weird thing to complain about with horror in general and King in particular, but Dreamcatcher is a really, really gross book. Lots and lots of frank discussion of shit and intestines and weasels chewing their way out of assholes and on and on.   All of that said, I actually like Dreamcatcher (and I don't even think the movie earns its toxic reputation), but it's far from King's best work."
stephenking,3cikhn,docwilson,5,Wed Jul 8 17:17:51 2015 UTC,"Though its far from my favorite, i thoroughly enjoyed it apart from some mild disappointment with the ending. I've always been puzzled by its unpopularity among fans.   One thing I've discovered, whatever book you like least is someone else's favorite king novel."
stephenking,3cikhn,Working_and_Lurking,4,Wed Jul 8 13:40:38 2015 UTC,Dreamcatcher was my first King novel too! I love how the main character (I forget his name) has to hide from Mr. Gray within his own mind.
stephenking,3cikhn,Deweyrob2,6,Wed Jul 8 05:26:05 2015 UTC,"That's the part that has stick with me too. The way King describes what it is like to be a prisoner in one's own mind, literally, is classic King."
stephenking,3cikhn,clwestbr,5,Wed Jul 8 13:48:35 2015 UTC,"Jonesy! My husband and I formed a deep connection because of this book. Our first conversation was about ""Dreamcatcher"". He still says we have a son he wants to name him Jonesy!"
stephenking,3cikhn,Rev_Jim_lgnatowski,3,Wed Jul 8 06:22:21 2015 UTC,"He's admitted to tripping balls on painkillers from his accident whole writing this if I remember right.

I think part of the flack it gets is from the terrible movie that, with all the acting and directing talent on board, should have been much better.  Though getting the guy who was known best for directing romances and dramas to direct a sci-fi thriller/horror was maybe not the best of ideas."
stephenking,3cikhn,ClawZ90,3,Wed Jul 8 12:24:33 2015 UTC,"I'm in your same boat, it was my first King novel and I absolutely loved it.  The atmosphere at the beginning in the cabin was amazing.

stephenking,3cikhn,city17_dweller,2,Wed Jul 8 14:16:01 2015 UTC,How does it compare to the less than stellar movie? That said I still kinda like the film!
stephenking,3cikhn,Nowin,3,Wed Jul 8 13:34:45 2015 UTC,"I can understand loving it if it was the first book you read - but King has used the 'special person in a group of friends' trope a lot, so for most it didn't have the charm it needed to pull off a weak plot and weaker ending.  It had good points.  When King focusses on one character in a given situation he usually knocks it out of the park, but there was too much mass-exposition and patchwork goings-on.  But there's also a personal bias, for me - I've loved exactly none of King's sci-fi attempts, they just don't do anything for me."
stephenking,3cikhn,danceswithronin,4,Wed Jul 8 06:16:48 2015 UTC,"See it's so weird, I typically hate Sci-fi novels but I love Kings take on Sci-Fi! I guess I like it because so much is put into the characters as opposed to the the aliens or whatever."
stephenking,3cikhn,JohnLocke815,5,Wed Jul 8 06:20:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's hard to put anything Stephen King writes into any single genre. He's his own genre. There's usually a mix of horror, scifi, supernatural, fantasy, suspense, mystery, and a dash of comedy."
stephenking,3cikhn,tsemochang,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:32:57 2015 UTC,"I dunno, it's one of my favorites of his post-van novels. From an objective point as an English Lit major I can see why it isn't technically one of his best books, but it's one I had a lot of fun reading.

stephenking,3cg1jq,VaranusNiloticus,0,Tue Jul 7 21:22:04 2015 UTC,"Just like World War Z, and the Shining.  The only thing that the movie has in common with the book is the title."
stephenking,3cg1jq,Tia00017,3,Tue Jul 7 22:58:50 2015 UTC,Uh...The Shining had a lot more in common with the novel than WWZ had with its novel. I hate that just because King doesn't like it hardcore fans decide its a shit movie that has nothing to do with the story. It missed some points but its a wonderful film in its own right and had much more than just the title in common.
stephenking,3cg1jq,clwestbr,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:45:56 2015 UTC,"It was a great movie, but I would have liked it to stay more true to the source material.  I'm not saying it's a shit movie, just a shit move on Kubricks part.  Also I enjoyed Maximum Overdrive,  which King hated."
stephenking,3cg1jq,Tia00017,3,Tue Jul 7 23:48:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it's a shit movie, just a shit move on Kubricks part.   Except so much of the novel doesn't adapt to film. King's adaptation proved that faithfulness does not always equal quality, and can in fact be a detriment. Kubrick realized that and decided to tell a different story. Its not the superior one, but rather equally iconic in a different way and medium. There was little way to stay close to the source material when everything was in Jack's head, the way the hotel spoke to him and such was stuff no one else could see. So Kubrick made him a man bordering on insanity that the hotel pushed over, rather than a man struggling against alcoholism that the hotel consumed. It worked better for what he was doing, but King refused to see that because the novel is one of his babies and I respect that. I just don't agree."
stephenking,3cg1jq,clwestbr,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:51:24 2015 UTC,"The thing that bothered me the most was how they portrayed Jonathan Torrance.  In the book John is an extremely sympathetic character. His power as a protagonist lies in his deep desire, and great potential, to be a good person – a good father, a good husband, and a good writer. Yet, he's a tragic figure with very specific demons, namely his temper, his alcoholism, and the memory of his abusive, alcoholic father. The Overlook, and whatever it is that lurks there, magnifies the intensity of John's demons. The hotel transforms Jack from protagonist with occasional bouts of antagonism, to a full-blown antagonist. But even in Jack's horrific final moments, slivers of love remain.  While in the movie, he's a cold hearted psychopath that never loved his family."
stephenking,3cg1jq,Tia00017,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:16:44 2015 UTC,"Honestly though you see that he loves his family, but they're a stress on his life that Jack can't handle when coupled with his white-knuckle sobriety. He is already on edge from the sobriety in the beginning of the film, and his wife needing his help and his son needing his attention/guidance in the midst of his psychic maturation are breaking him already at that point.   I agree that it wasn't the novel's Jack Torrance, but it was rather a different yet equally interesting character. He wasn't as one-dimensional as 'a cold hearted psychopath that never loved his family', there's much more to him than that. Kubrick actually flattened a lot of the crazy out of his performance."
stephenking,3cg1jq,clwestbr,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:26:18 2015 UTC,How about the fact that Jack reads Playgirl?  http://images.mentalfloss.com/sites/default/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/the-shining.jpg  That's pretty messed up.
stephenking,3cg1jq,Tia00017,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:31:18 2015 UTC,"Again, I have no issue with that in context of the film. In the novel yeah, I'd have a problem because it doesn't match his character, but film-Jack is meant to seem burnt out and souring on his marriage. In the film it makes sense and works for the character in terms of someone with sexual issues and such. There was kind of a theory that he may have been abused sexually as a child in the film version of the story and this is in keeping with the ideas behind that in that era.  He may also just be bisexual and his wife is ok with it because he's faithful outside of checking out some dong in a magazine. Who knows."

stephenking,3cfvil,Prudence_Bindlestiff,9,Tue Jul 7 16:21:55 2015 UTC,One thing that always amazes me is when Hollywood obtains the rights to a book and then decides to stray from what made it special to begin with.
stephenking,3cfvil,DarthAlexander9,6,Tue Jul 7 16:29:54 2015 UTC,"I just read a Neil Gaiman story that was about that. The character in the story writes a novel called Sons of Man about the children of Charles Manson who become evil. He gets hired to write the screenplay but the studio execs ask for so many changes that at the end it no longer resembles the novel they paid for. It becomes a movie called When We Were Badd, about a fictional killer named Jack Badd whose ghost possesses some teenagers through a video game."

I love King, probably a shade more than Koontz now, but Koontz will always be a favorite of mine ever since my dad gave me a copy of Watchers to read, before I started with King.   His newer stuff is hit or miss, but if you like King, give these books by Koontz a try, which are his classics, imo. None of them hold a candle to stuff like It or The Stand, but not much does.   Watchers, From the Corner of His Eye, The Bad Place, Lightning, and Intensity. All really good reads with top notch villains."

They're all so good. My all time favorite has to be Jurassic Park, but The Terminal Man is very King-esqe. That one is about a man who suffers brain damage and sometimes has blackouts, and during those blackouts he might walk around and beat or murder people, only to wake up with no knowledge of it.

Now, with that being said, a lot of his work is tied together. The Dark Tower Series pretty much arks over a vast majority of his work. The Stand, 'Salems Lot, Eyes of the Dragon, and even Desperation all fall under that. Then you have the Castle Rock books, which include Cujo, The Dead Zone and The body (which was in Different Seasons and a movie, Stand by me) which I would say was in a different universe, although they do reference 'Salems Lot, if I'm not mistaken...

I haven't read Carrie in a while, but I think there is mention of a large dog a few towns over. Either that, or one of the other books mentions a fire in a school. I got lucky with the order I read them, and something like 4 or 5 of the books I read in a row all referenced the previous one.   It happened again recently, too.  I was on a business trip, and read Joyland, The Wind Through the Keyhole (I think that's the title), and Revival, and saw the reference to Joyland."

The ""Castle Rock"" you're pointing to is a tiny island in Casco Bay that looks to be about 100' x 500'. The fictional town in his stories is in Western Maine, near Lovell, where King has a house.

stephenking,3c5xms,Grave_Girl,3,Sun Jul 5 13:38:24 2015 UTC,"In the book it's viewed as two separate strings of murders - one in 1958 and one in 1985. At the same time it's not suspected the work of a serial killer, but unrelated killings. For example, one kid goes missing but is assumed to have run away, one girl's body turns up in the river but they suspect a boyfriend killed her, etc. I'm not sure but I think it's implied that It somehow fogs the minds of the adults in Derry, so they don't make all the connections. Even if the townspeople are frightened by murders that are obviously the work of a psycho, the killing sprees only last a year and a half to two years before It goes dormant again for 27 years.  Tragedies are common in real life, and people have an amazing capacity to ignore all the evidence of something being amiss. I don't think it's very odd that people keep living in Derry."
stephenking,3c5xms,deviger,2,Sun Jul 5 18:32:49 2015 UTC,"But murders happen everywhere. Hell, I live right outside of New Orleans. People are being killed here constantly. But dead bodies aren't evil in or of themselves. In IT, the people were dying because of the evil. If there was a story featuring my city, the evil would be the cause of all the murders. Even though different people are committing the crimes, it's the evil in the city (or sewers or water or wherever"" infecting them and ""making"" them do it. IT was a bit different because those killings were unexplained (at least, I think most of them were) but it's mentioned in other books as well. 11/22/63 mentions Bev and Ritchie and the killings in Derry. I believe the kids may say something was wrong or felt wrong in Derry but that it was gone now (because it took place after their actions in IT)."

stephenking,3c66jl,frostblooded,2,Sun Jul 5 12:32:19 2015 UTC,"I think alot of authors write a little of themselves, or sometimes a lot, into characters. Sometimes it's blatantly obvious and the main character, other times it's not so much and a tertiary character. I like to think that Stephen King writing his issues out in character format actually helped him overcome those issues.

He builds complex characters and then inserts them into the drama. I feel a lot of writers come up with scenarios or situations and then writes characters to fit the story.   King comes up with great characters, figures out they're most afraid of, most vulnerable to, what they desire and then writes a story about that.  Even if I'm not into the plot of a King book, I'm still into the character he came up with."
stephenking,3c5x07,TheFifthBox,6,Sun Jul 5 08:00:39 2015 UTC,"This. 100 pages of set up, then the pay off."
stephenking,3c5x07,Rasalom,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:22:34 2015 UTC,"I agree and it makes sense. I think about it like he creates realistic, believable characters. And he has an idea (if not fully fleshed out) of a story for them. But he sort of... follows them along. Guiding them but also on a journey of discovery himself (I think he may have even said he did something similar to that at one point)...    Also, it explains why he sometimes struggles with endings. Since he's sort of a participant but it ultimately has to end I think the ending can sometimes feel forced. Maybe I'm wrong."
stephenking,3c5x07,cates,9,Tue Jul 7 01:02:36 2015 UTC,"Personally, I feel like it's his ability to write stories about regular people in extraordinary circumstances. I find that often the characters start out like regular people, often even people you wouldn't normally like (I'm thinking of Larry Underwood for example or Eddie Dean) but as the story progresses their situations bring out the best qualities in them. I believe that makes it easy for readers to fall in love with his characters. They feel believable.  Also, from a technical stand point, his writing is easy to read. His sentences flow together easily, if that makes sense. I've read the entire Dark Tower series out loud to my boyfriend and it was easy compared to reading someone like Isaac Asimov out loud.  Lastly, he's not afraid to kill characters in his stories. Even main characters. This keeps even the constant reader on their toes. You never know what's coming."
stephenking,3c5x07,Empress_Shewolf,4,Sun Jul 5 03:41:00 2015 UTC,"Characters. The kids from It. The cast of The Stand and The Dark Tower. He is a master at building characters and making you care about them, or hate them. Ben Hanscom and Larry Underwood are two good examples of this."
stephenking,3c5x07,NakedYo,3,Sun Jul 5 15:30:41 2015 UTC,"As has been pointed out, King creates memorable characters whose complexity and realism are more reminiscent of literary fiction than genre.  He is equally gifted with creating real everyday protagonists as well as comedic and grotesque characters.  The other thing for me with King is his ability to describe places and events in great detail without bogging the story down.  I feel that I am really there in the story.  This connects with his gift for dramatic pacing of events that move the story along at just the right pace for heightened involvement and suspense.  In short, King has a Dickensian capacity to create memorable people, places and stories.  While he is best known for his horror work, he has ventured into many different forms, including the literary short story, and as far I as I am concerned he can write whatever he damn wants and I will be happy to read it.    I haven't read everything he has written, but a hell of a lot of it, and first started back in the 1970s with Carrie and 'Salem's Lot."
stephenking,3c5x07,stasw,2,Sun Jul 5 23:44:39 2015 UTC,"King is great at creating three dimensional, believable characters that feel like they could be real people. He is also really great at dialogue. He rarely writes one note characters that are completely good or evil, and this makes them compelling to read about. His plotting can be hit and miss, with more hits ovetall, but I always like his characters."
stephenking,3c5x07,ChronoTravis85,2,Sun Jul 5 17:53:48 2015 UTC,"Like everyone else has said, King has very strong characterization.  He's good at everyman characters most of his readers can see themselves in, or at least sympathize with.  I think he writes children particularly well; far too many writers have children who serve as nothing more than plot accessories who are weirdly mature and see the world as do adults.  King doesn't do that.  Even the kids with supernatural powers are still kids, with the immature worldview and mistakes in logic that real, actual children have.  Also, I think he's very good at pacing.  This isn't everyone's favorite thing, but I find it enjoyable.  Pet Sematery I think is the best example of this--long stretches of normal life punctuated by brief bursts of insanity.  It fits loosely within the typical plot structure, but instead of the smooth building toward climax, King's plots look kind of like rollercoasters--you'll go straight for a while, then there's a sharp rise-and-drop, straight a while longer, another sharp-rise-and-drop, etc, and all the while you're slowly being maneuvered toward the climax, but you don't realize just how steep and fast that last drop is going to be.  And I totally agree with /u/Empress_Shewolf that his writing is just technically fantastic.  He's got a very distinct voice as an author, his sentences flow smoothly unless purposely broken up, and he seems to always use the best word for a given situation."
stephenking,3c5x07,Grave_Girl,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:04:08 2015 UTC,"King writes wonderful characters- as people have said.   I also think that he's an incredibly visual writer. He's said before than when a student would come to him with a block, his first question to them was usually about what the scene looks like, to get them picturing and describing the events unfolding again. Which is really a pretty brilliant trick, one I've used myself when I'm stuck on a writing project. It's also one of the things that makes many of his books translatable to movies, there's a definite vision for what the scenes look like that seems to be like catnip for filmmakers."
stephenking,3c5x07,argleblather,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:40:11 2015 UTC,"Personally I find that he makes his characters feel real. I can't stand books where the characters are ""perfect"".

He's not some phony white knight character who never does anything wrong and is always noble."

stephenking,3byrsl,MarioSpeedwagon13,5,Fri Jul 3 08:54:43 2015 UTC,I actually liked it. I thought it was interesting how the car was given character and came to be and basically manipulated or consumed the main character.  It's not the most exciting work he's done but it's worth a read.
stephenking,3byrsl,Abraveliltoaster,5,Fri Jul 3 08:46:57 2015 UTC,"I'm currently reading it. I'm about 5 chapters in and im really enjoying it, so personally i would recommend it from what I've already read."

I get to the same point (roughly) in the book every time, put it down and don't pick it up again until years later. I start from the beginning again and repeat. For some reason it just doesn't keep my interest."

And it's scary in a visceral, ugly way, that sticks to your brain, to your soul, and never lets go.  So maybe you should read The Long Walk. That's a pretty great book."

I prefer Pet Sematary by a long shot, possibly the horror author's most frightening book and full of really disturbing subject matter.  But The Long Walk is a fan favorite that deals with a lot of weird youth issues. I love that one as well, just not as much, but its the more marketable."
stephenking,3bxuw7,Critter17,2,Fri Jul 3 03:02:34 2015 UTC,"I've never read a horror novel so it'll be a new thing for me, I licked up both actually cause they were cheap. Thank you!"

stephenking,3bxuw7,adamav,3,Fri Jul 3 03:59:53 2015 UTC,Do both. Read The Long Walk on a treadmill going 5mph and you'll definitely get into it. Read PS at night before bed. Both are essential books to being a SK fan and too different to eliminate one for the other.

It almost occurred to king himself and this is why he wrote it.   For king himself, this is his most scary book, a book that he wrote then read 3 weeks later then deciding that he has gone too far and this book will never be published. later, some circumstances caused it to be published.   The long walk is a sort of sci-fi story that you can not easily connect to without some philosophical abstraction."

stephenking,3btb0e,GreggoryBasore,2,Thu Jul 2 15:58:03 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. That story (all of them really) could have easily worked well as stand-alone pieces, and still kept Ted's ""abilities"" and his being hunted. At least it could have been done way more subtly--when the Low Men start talking it does take me out of it a bit.  Although when Ted makes an appearance in DT, tears come to my eyes--I missed him so much! One of my favorite King characters."

stephenking,3bt65w,_llama_queen,6,Wed Jul 1 23:02:59 2015 UTC,"I would do Running Man due to more similarities.   The focus is on one man (while in L.W, it focuses on 100 men) Running man has a death match where you get hunted down no matter what(L.W. you only get killed if you drop speed) Running man is televised (L.W isn't) The main character is against the organizers (L.W is also) Fight for your life (L.W also) Deemed the "" enemy of the state"" (In Hunger Games they were enemies of each other) Dystopian future (L.W isn't necessarily a dystopian society) Will update when I think if more."
stephenking,3bt65w,Tia00017,7,Thu Jul 2 00:06:22 2015 UTC,"Not trying to argue, just to discuss. Some thoughts on your points.   In Long Walk, Garraty is sort of the focal point among the group of competitors similar to Katniss. Also he develops friendships with the others in a similar manner, although they don't get to the overthrow the tyrant stage.  All but one person in the Long Walk will die, similar to how the Hunger Games are supposed to operate, until love changes the world.  Running Man isn't live broadcast in a continuous feed. They have updates from the videos that Ben sends, but that's probably not much more than the news teams that drop in on the LW, and the LW draws a large live audience.  I would say that the world of LW was pretty damned dystopian. It might even be the same world as The Running Man, just at an earlier point on the timeline."

I wouldn't say that there was any environmental disasters, or cataclysmic decline in society in LW.   It is somewhat dystopian, but not purely."
stephenking,3bt65w,Tia00017,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:31:22 2015 UTC,"Nothing is purely dystopian. They had a totalitarian government that staged events such as The Long Walk and would make dissidents disappear. This likely came as an after effect of a war of some sort.

If I recall correctly, The Running Man begins with the protagonist applying to a reality TV station and through a series of tests is selected for The Running Man show.

stephenking,3bqqpx,HoraceDerwent,20,Wed Jul 1 11:35:49 2015 UTC,"Short stories are damn good and don't suffer from the ""I wish I knew how to end this"" syndrome like many of his novels."
stephenking,3bqqpx,sealless,39,Wed Jul 1 13:52:35 2015 UTC,"Disagree. While his short stories are excellent and do often get straight to the point, his novels allow for character development, which I feel is where he really excels."
stephenking,3bqqpx,memphis171,14,Wed Jul 1 12:15:50 2015 UTC,"SK characters are the best, I really feel myself seeing through their eyes and caring about how things turn out for them."

stephenking,3bqqpx,jortan,6,Wed Jul 1 19:12:50 2015 UTC,"Yes. I think it is more that his storytelling, i.e. specifically developing the plot, moving the narrative forward, and (most especially) wrapping it up, is much better in his shorter works.  All that said, though, I generally enjoy it when his novels go off on a tangent to fill out a character/backstory. I think the main thing is the endings, which are of course much commented on."
stephenking,3bqqpx,bge951,14,Wed Jul 1 13:56:20 2015 UTC,I think his novellas are the best of both worlds. Can't think of one I dislike come to think of it
stephenking,3bqqpx,Hugh_Jampton,7,Wed Jul 1 13:54:16 2015 UTC,"I think critics would find his short stories to be much better, and they are exceptional. However who gives a fuck what critics think. Long form King builds worlds and characters that almost exist and hides lots of gems in the process. As long as you keep in mind that it's about the journey and not the destination, his novels are where it's at."
stephenking,3bqqpx,Rev_Jim_lgnatowski,9,Wed Jul 1 16:18:32 2015 UTC,"He would agree with you. He is on record as saying he suffers from literary elephantiasis. 'Apt Pupil' in DIFFERENT SEASONS was supposed to be a short story and it kept bloating on him. Several of his novels have done the same: you could trime 300-400 pages off NEEDFUL THINGS, DREAMCATCHER, CELL, and UNDER THE DOME and not miss them much. That said, he has written some phenomenal epic novels. IT springs to mind immediately, as does THE STAND."
stephenking,3bqqpx,Ken_Breadbox,2,Wed Jul 1 12:18:02 2015 UTC,"I don't recall Cell being all that long, maybe only 300-400 pages in total...but I didn't like it very much, so I would be okay with trimming all 300-400 pages ;)  I think Under the Dome could probably have been trimmed more than Needful Things. I can't think of much in Needful Things that didn't contribute to the story."
stephenking,3bqqpx,measureinlove,2,Wed Jul 1 20:59:40 2015 UTC,"Just my opinion, but NEEDFUL THINGS felt like a theme and variations....with too many variations."
stephenking,3bqqpx,Ken_Breadbox,2,Thu Jul 2 00:45:20 2015 UTC,"Okay, I can see that. He did beat that horse long after it was dead. But I think it did do a pretty good job of illustrating how saturated the town was by Gaunt's influence."
stephenking,3bqqpx,measureinlove,4,Thu Jul 2 01:58:24 2015 UTC,"While what you say is definitely true, his short stories get straight to the point and he showcases his storytelling wonderfully in these, and his longer books do tend to seem like he is being paid by the word sometimes. But as others have said, I think what King does better than anyone else I've read is develop characters that I give a fuck about. I've cried over more of Kings characters than I care to admit. And I think a lot of the filler, though it doesn't add too much to the plot,  is what attaches me to the characters and see them in a day to day setting."
stephenking,3bqqpx,silentpat530,3,Wed Jul 1 14:20:34 2015 UTC,"I haven't read a lot of his short stories, but I have read enough to enjoy them, but I find that they aren't as memorable as the larger novels like the stand or the dark tower."
stephenking,3bqqpx,awag,2,Wed Jul 1 12:11:03 2015 UTC,"I find myself rereading his short stories way more often than anything else I read. I don't know exactly why, but they feel a little more right to me than his novels.   Don't get me wrong, I love his novels. But I've got all the same tired complaints about them that everybody else feels at some point.  I think that his short stories give just enough to leave me craving more. Some of his shorts have really made me think deeply about life in general."
stephenking,3bqqpx,mmmmpork,2,Wed Jul 1 16:43:04 2015 UTC,"It is a bit like comparing a symphony with a orchestral pop song. Yeah, they have things in common, but they are separate art forms. The only thing they have in common is that they are both forms of prose narrative.    That being said, compare 1408 with The Shining, and I think you will find that the Shining is a more complete work of art in its art form. By that I mean that while 1408 is entertaining and good, it isn't great in the world of short stories like The Shining is great in the world of novels. King is at his best when he is writing longer-length works. Joe Hill, on the other hand, rocks at his short-story writing. 20th Century Ghosts contains better stories than I think his dad has ever done all in one volume. Either his editor is phenomenal, or Hill has talent in that area that his dad never had.  However, King's novellas are superb works. The Body is wonderful. So, it seems to me that King's talent really requires more ""meat on the bone"" in order to produce great art. King loves to layer on and extend out and go deeper with his stories than what the classic short-story seems to allow for. He gallops after the novel with everything he writes."
stephenking,3bqqpx,EnIdiot,2,Wed Jul 1 21:29:28 2015 UTC,"His best works have been in the fantasy genre imo, Dark Tower: Wastelands & Wizard and Glass plus Eyes of the Dragon were his best imo"
stephenking,3bqqpx,acompletesmeghead,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:30:21 2015 UTC,"I agree with you and have thought this for some time now.  He's written some fantastic novels but as we all know, many of them suffer from the same issues; overly long, poor endings, etc.  I think he really excels at short form writing because above all, King is a masterful storyteller and short form writing allows him to tell a compact story without the fat that comes with a 900 page epic.  There are several of his short stories that I would place above his novels when it comes to my favorite works of his."
stephenking,3bqqpx,scumbag_college,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:36:44 2015 UTC,"Usually I think this is the case too. Personally, I think Misery, The Stand and Cell are amazing, but all of his other novels are.....I don't know. Too much filler, or he starts developing and adding characters so much that it gets confusing. And his short stories usually have one point only-scare the reader. Most of his novels don't really have a scare factor. Maybe they're creepy or uncomfortable, but his short stories(I'd say most Night Shift and Everything's Eventual) genuinely come across as disturbing. But then again, up to the reader.  If you're more into physiological and character development, you'll love his novels. If you're going for more of a scare, reading a short story is the trick."
stephenking,3bqqpx,LovelyColors,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:41:39 2015 UTC,"He's a very good novelist but often tends to overwrite (Needful Things, Insomnia, etc.) and his endings are often weak (with notable exceptions, like Pet Sematary).   His short stories and novellas, by contrast, are consistently brilliant. He's a master at economy of language and sustaining mood when he works within the constraints of shorter forms (e.g., such disparate stories as ""The Last Rung of the Ladder,"" ""The Ledge""  and ""The Body."")"

stephenking,3bqqpx,apikoros18,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:56:44 2015 UTC,"I would agree.  He has some great novels, but also some just okay ones.  His short stories and novellas are more consistently magnificent.  That being said, I enjoy it all to varying degrees."
stephenking,3bqqpx,Sophie19,0,Wed Jul 1 21:46:31 2015 UTC,I think he is a master at building characters.  I prefer his novels for that reason. His characters far outweigh his often weak endings IMHO.

stephenking,3bo91v,420fuck,4,Wed Jul 1 01:23:13 2015 UTC,"It disturbed me a lot when I read it, because as far as I know from what I've read, that was the first time he's actually addressed what happens after death. I always thought that would be the one subject he would NEVER touch, I mean, things come back from the dead all the time but he's never described what they came back FROM, we've never followed a character past their last breath. Idk about other people but for me that really took the ending to the next level, being the first time he ever actually outright addresses that - and it was fucking horrifying. I was actually kind of worried about him until I read about how it was basically an homage to Lovecraft. Then it all made more sense."
stephenking,3bo91v,TotallyNot_MikeDirnt,2,Tue Jun 30 23:49:22 2015 UTC,"I think it was an amazing ending, really shocked me. Very lovecraftian. I know some people didn't like Revival, but i loved it!"

stephenking,3boo0a,anaxarchos,3,Tue Jun 30 22:13:03 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say that this would be an ""exclusive"" audio book since it will be included in his forthcoming short-story collection ""The Bazaar of Bad Dreams"" in the winter.   I'm impartial to audiobooks as I usually listen to them at work, though, I prefer physical books because I have something to display and loan. Some times, it's all too easy to hit play on an audiobook and miss crucial details. I find it's near impossible to do that when reading. That's just me, though."
stephenking,3boo0a,thejonnyMAGNUM,2,Wed Jul 1 16:31:26 2015 UTC,"AAAAGGGHHH can't finish the article because I prefer to read books knowing as little as possible. Can't wait to start this one. But it's so neat that King is a big audiobook fan. My lifestyle made it really hard to find time to read paper books but I joined Audible in 2008 and have been subscribing since. At first my credits would accumulate and I would be forced to spend some before they expire after six months. Now I'm on the plan that gets two credits a month and I go through them like water. Sometimes a narrator is annoying but I'm less turned off after listening to lots of books than I was when it was a new thing.   I can appreciate books differently in print, sometimes (to be really basic) 'gnawing' and 'knowing' might be interesting in the same phrase in print, but in audio 'nothing' and 'knowing' and 'snowing' might light up my brain a bit if used near each other.   It's just neat that King finds 'passive reading' as legit, I always feel like I need a disclaimer when I say I've 'read' an audiobook."
stephenking,3boo0a,twerkysandwich,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:07:43 2015 UTC,I feel the same as you. I subscribed two years ago and have fifteen books by King. I love listening to the books he's written. Most of time the narrators are great and I also find myself going back and re listening to some.

stephenking,3bo4ks,ragnok999,2,Tue Jun 30 19:56:39 2015 UTC,Can you give me a general idea of what Joyland is about?
stephenking,3bo4ks,thejonnyMAGNUM,7,Tue Jun 30 20:05:34 2015 UTC,"Joyland is a story about growing up and growing old. Devin Jones is a student at UNH and works at a carnival over the summer of his junior year (if I remember right) and he learns the in's and out's of carnie life. There's an underlying mystery of someone who was murdered on the haunted house ride and there's tales of her ghost being stuck on it. Don't concentrate on that, though, because the book is mostly about Devin realizing he's an adult.  It's a fantastic book and an even better book to read in the summer. I highly recommend you start with that."
stephenking,3bo4ks,jon_slush,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:12:56 2015 UTC,Also be sure to read Joyland before Revival.

stephenking,3bo4ks,csjohnson,3,Tue Jul 7 23:17:35 2015 UTC,"Ohh boy. That's a tough one because his later works are my favorites. Start with Revival, then Doctor Sleep, Then Finders Keepers, and finally Joyland. I loved Doctor Sleep, probably one of his better ones lately."
stephenking,3bo4ks,PenguinOfBoom,3,Tue Jun 30 19:55:09 2015 UTC,"I'd start with Joyland because it's a really nice story (as most of SK's) and a pretty quick read.  Then Mr. Mercedes before Finders Keepers so you have a little bit of background on FK.  As for Dr. Sleep, if you don't have The Shining fresh in your memory I'd recommend to go back to it since Dr. Sleep is its sequel."

stephenking,3bo9h3,Leslie_Chowder,12,Tue Jun 30 20:26:53 2015 UTC,"I interpreted the ending as a very dark one. The idea that ""sometimes dead is better"" is a central theme of the book. None of the people or animals that were resurrected ever came back the same. Some were more evil than others, but none were ""good."" As I read, I felt that Louis was becoming more and more detached from reality. The fact that he had the option of resurrecting his lost loved ones rendered him incapable of letting them go emotionally - driving him to madness and allowing evil spirits to reanimate the corpses of Church, Gage, and Rachel."
stephenking,3bo9h3,MonsterInTheGarage,3,Tue Jun 30 20:53:05 2015 UTC,"Yes, I think this comment nails it."
stephenking,3bo9h3,gunslinger__,4,Wed Jul 1 06:48:36 2015 UTC,"I always assumed that Rachel came back all wrong. I think that she winds up coming back worse than Gage because she's bigger and more mentally advanced than he is/was.   Stephen King wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation; at the very end of the movie, it's implied that Rachel stabs Lewis (she picks up a knife when he embraces her, then it fades to black and we hear Lewis screaming)."
stephenking,3bo9h3,Onefortheisland,2,Tue Jun 30 22:45:51 2015 UTC,"I feel it was meant to be somewhat open ended.   I personally thought it was Kings best ending.

stephenking,3bo9h3,smoothisfast22,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:43:57 2015 UTC,"I guess to some extent it's ambiguous. From the ""darling"" she might seem like a less evil zombie than Gage, but equally it could just be because she was more developed than Gage when she died and came back, and therefore had the capacity for more lucid thought, but still with a demonic urge to kill.  I've always assumed that mere seconds after the book ends, Louis suffers a most terrible death at her hands."
stephenking,3bo9h3,marcusthecrab,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:54:30 2015 UTC,"Well, when the people came back, they were always under the control of the spirit of the burial ground, and therefore were not thinking there own thoughts, which led me to think that Rachel killed Luis in the end."

If I recall, it was King's son who gave him a hand with the ending (endings are not one of King's strong suits).  On another note, I don't think King made as good use of the ""card"" men as he could have.

I liked King's take on a classic sci-fi premise, going back and stopping the JFK assassination, only to let the protagonist succeed and discover it was a terrible mistake.

stephenking,3bgijh,jeromerules,11,Mon Jun 29 00:51:44 2015 UTC,"I do love this book. I think that because it's a 'horror' novel from a popular author, it doesn't tend to get credit for as much gravitas as it encompasses. I re-read this one every few years, and I come away with something new from it every time. Lately, seeing co-workers with aging parents, and my own parents aging it's become a very chilling narrative about what getting older can really be like, as formidable people start to lose themselves."
stephenking,3bgijh,argleblather,2,Mon Jun 29 01:36:21 2015 UTC,"That's a good point. The story definitely drives itself on the main characters' confrontation with death and aging. That, in itself, is horrific just as it is meaningful."
stephenking,3bgijh,katoninetales,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:38:36 2015 UTC,"I think that because it's a 'horror' novel from a popular author   I'm terribly confused by this idea.  Are we not considering the works of his that do get a lot of praise ""horror"" now?"
stephenking,3bgijh,argleblather,2,Mon Jun 29 11:17:10 2015 UTC,It's more that books classified as horror don't tend to get as critically recognized as straight fiction. Same with popular authors.
stephenking,3bgijh,Low_Man_n_Yella_Coat,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:36:04 2015 UTC,"I would also take issue with the idea of classifying it as 'horror,' which may be why it doesn't appeal to King's fanbase as much as it otherwise might do."
stephenking,3bgijh,Tia00017,3,Tue Jun 30 16:48:28 2015 UTC,"It's a great book, I just think it's not one of his more well known books.  I never knew about it until I saw it at the library a few years back.  I also think that it plays on a different kind of horror than all his other books, and the fans don't like it.  They want ""I wasn't planning on sleeping tonight"" horror, while Dolores hands them ""this could really happen to you"" horror.  Personally, this book is in my top 10 list of King books."
stephenking,3bgijh,Tia00017,3,Mon Jun 29 02:12:04 2015 UTC,"I agree with that -- it is radically different from King's usual genre tales and may disorient the King enthusiasts. Which is a shame, I think this book by itself is a fantastic piece of work. I hope it becomes one of the more highly regarded pieces of late 20th century fiction when all is said and done.   However, in being lesser known -- it was the best selling novel of 1992, and the movie adaptation was quite successful and critically applauded. I somehow think it was forgotten, and I'm not sure how."
stephenking,3bgijh,katoninetales,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:37:02 2015 UTC,"I did not know that it was the best selling novel. TIL, and I have seen, and own the movie as well.  So I guess it's not that it's not well known, but was forgotten. I agree.   I also agree that it's a fantastic price of work. Well written, made me feel for both Dolores and her children. Not many books do that to me  Edit: I think it was forgotten due to how it was left in the dust by the other ming works (Shining, Carrie, Christine)"
stephenking,3bgijh,Psychopath-,2,Mon Jun 29 02:51:23 2015 UTC,"To be fair, most of King's works were among the bestsellers for their release years . His were the top novels of 1984 (The Talisman), '86 (It), '87 (The Tommyknockers), and '92 (Dolores Claiborne). King pretty consistently had books in the top five annual bestsellers through the 80s and 90s, with The Dead Zone just a little lower in '79, and he dipped a little in popularity through the 2000s but rebounded with 11/22/63 being the #2 bestseller of 2011."

stephenking,3bgijh,topher2012,3,Mon Jun 29 02:46:24 2015 UTC,"I'm glad the post served as a little motivation. :) If I were to recommend a new King reader any of his works, it would be Misery, 1922, ""Jerusalem's Lot,"" or Dolores Claiborne. I find these to be impressive starters."
stephenking,3bgijh,Damien__,3,Mon Jun 29 03:05:27 2015 UTC,I love it as well. Wasn't exactly horror though so King fans may not like it as much and non-King fans may not know they would like it.   It doesn't get a lot of discussion around here.   It is a great book to have read to you. Pick up the unabridged audio book read by Frances Sternhagen. Outstanding.
stephenking,3bgijh,Szwejkowski,3,Mon Jun 29 02:58:30 2015 UTC,I second the audiobook recommendation. It was outstanding. I thought Sternhagen nailed the accent.
stephenking,3bgijh,Szwejkowski,3,Mon Jun 29 15:58:47 2015 UTC,Yeah she did a fantastic job both in accent and attitude/characterization. In fact even though the movie was good I think I was disappointed in it because Sternhagen did such a great job on the reading.
stephenking,3bgijh,Twentymenthol,2,Tue Jun 30 00:07:40 2015 UTC,I was wondering how an audiobook version might sound. I may have to pick that up!
stephenking,3bgijh,Szwejkowski,4,Mon Jun 29 03:08:12 2015 UTC,"I agree that it's a good book, but for all its literary merit - it's just not that interesting (for my tastes, at least). It's accomplished, but dull - readably dull, because his ear for language is so very sharp - but still.  I think the best stories give you a tour of the complex and murky depths of the human condition and creeping shadows, shuffling monsters, spaceships and wizards. Entertainment and depth are not mutually exclusive and I like to have both in a delicious wordy sandwich."
stephenking,3bgijh,sockgorilla,3,Mon Jun 29 02:58:48 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with your idea for what makes a good book -- style AND entertainment. I was thoroughly engaged with the story though, I felt their was a strong driving force behind the narrative. A page-turner, so to say. I was entertained not only by its suspense, but also from the ideas it provoked with each page. Out of curiosity, what did you feel was lacking from Dolores Claiborne's entertainment value?"
stephenking,3bgijh,sockgorilla,2,Mon Jun 29 03:11:09 2015 UTC,"For me, it was just too mundane. The most interesting things in DC for me were the dust kitties and the mystic dread surrounding the well - but there's not enough strange in it for my tastes.  I guess I just get enough gritty reality IRL, you know? Not fond of it."
stephenking,3bgijh,mmmmpork,2,Mon Jun 29 03:26:43 2015 UTC,"For me, the mundane aspects made the book. Instead of Big Scary Evil, you have the loathsome horror of a woman discovering just how abusive her husband is, and then there is the creeping horror of the old woman losing her mind. Two things that you have no control over, are terrifying to think about and could absolutely happen to you. Whilst scary alien clowns and vampires are great to read about, they simply don't hold the same sort of horror that one of your children coming to you and admitting that daddy is getting too friendly does."
stephenking,3bgijh,Lucky_leprechaun,2,Mon Jun 29 12:08:56 2015 UTC,"Well, good horror monsters are a metaphor for real things. The creepy clown in IT eating kids is the creepy peado killing kids after molesting them (see John Wayne Gacy). Even then, you still have Beverly's dad for a purely mundane and domestic slice of predatory creepiness.  I've had a lot of 'real' horrors happen to me in my life and there's no extra horror to be had in reading about things that have happened to you. There is some magic in metaphor, though. Personally I like this art of abstraction more than the art of recreating common real life horrors realistically.  Much as I like paintings that demonstrate a distinct style more than I like photo-realistic paintings, I guess."

stephenking,3bgijh,stop_saying_content,2,Mon Jun 29 18:34:03 2015 UTC,"If you'd like to get another dimension on the book, get the audio book version. I just finished that 2 weeks ago & it was powerful. The narrator (I can't remember her name right now) did a fantastic job with the Maine accent (I'm from Maine, poorly done Maine accents kill me).   She read the book with feeling & made the experience of the story so much deeper.   This really is one of King's better works, and in team with a great narrator, one of the best audio books I've listened to."

stephenking,3bg70i,Damien__,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:11:31 2015 UTC,"So I finished it a few minutes ago. I haven't yet wrapped my head around why and how it happened like that, or what the significance of him having the Horn of Eld this time around was.   At this point, I don't really have any feelings on the ending to be honest, because I'm just sad that it's over. I've been listening to it on audiobook since the middle of February. I don't think I've ever been this attached to characters before. I begged and pleaded King for Susan Delgado not to die, especially not like that. I felt so proud of Jake when girls started to notice him in Calla Brin Sturgis. My heart fell down through my stomach when Eddie died, then again when Jake died. Not just because they were gone, but because their deaths didn't feel deserving of gunslingers. My heart broke completely when Roland got down on his knees and begged Susannah to stay with him. I was so proud that Oy got to go out fighting, and saving his Din from one of their greatest enemies. I literally shouted in joy when Susannah met Eddie and Jake again in Central Park. I felt Roland's confusion mount as he climbed the tower, then realized what was happening with the same horror that he felt. Now I just feel drained, because it's over. But on the other hand, and I know it sounds ridiculous talking about a book character like this, I'm glad that Roland will get the chance to meet and come to love his ka-tet for the first time, again."
stephenking,3bg70i,steeljaw,2,Mon Jun 29 04:03:57 2015 UTC,"Now that you've finished (or you could say began again) I'll share my feelings on the ending.   However, I wanted to tell you that I too felt very close to these characters. This is my favorite book of all time and I'm not ashamed to say that I cried when Eddie died. I was so heartbroken picturing Susannah cleaning his body for a proper burial and singing the songs she would sing on the road. When Roland went out and told the breakers that they lost a member of their KaTet and that they had better leave, to hopefully find forgiveness in the callas, I wanted him to just fucking unload on some of them. But that's not the way a gunslinger carries himself.  When Jake died I wept, it was like losing a living person. I fucking cried for a long time and had to take a couple days off from the book to mourn him. He died saving all of the worlds, and all of the universes! He was such a good kid, and became such a powerful young man! I could hear Oy's howls in my mind, and I was so glad that he rejoined Roland and decided to continue the quest instead of staying with Ake. Did he say ""Bye Jake"" or ""I Ache""? I believe it was a little of both.  I was fiercely proud of Oy for protecting Roland and stopping Mordred! He was a gunslinger as well, there's no doubt in my mind.  I also cried when Susannah met Eddie and Jake in NY, but this time they were joyous tears! I believe that they went on to live wonderfully satisfying lives, and in the end they all deserved to do so.  The first time I read the end I felt as you did, a little empty knowing that the journey was over. I was a little conflicted because I had really expected some type of happy ending where Roland was congratulated for completing his quest by Gan himself, or him finding Susan Delgado waiting for him to join her in another world were they could live out their lives peacefully.  But after absorbing that this was not meant to be a lovey dovey happy go lucky kind of deal, I found the ending perfect.   For one, Roland has the horn this time around, which to me hints that he has more compassion this time around. And even though I believe, in the original cycle, that Roland did come to love and appreciate his KaTet (after the palace of Oz the Powerful in Kansas he told them that he loves them and does not want to see them die on his quest for the Tower) I still think that he didn't fully appreciate what he had until he lost them. Who knows what this cycle will hold for him, I like to think that the horn symbolizes his growth as a compassionate man, I like to think he will not let Jake drop this time.  The other thing I like about the end is very simple, it starts at the beginning again. It says ""you can start the quest again, you can come back to mid-world and fall in love with these characters again. And again. And again, until your thirst has been quenched"". I've read this series so many times I've lost count, and each time I still become emotionally attached to this KaTet.  If you haven't yet read Wind Through The Keyhole, I highly recommend it! It's a great book and it's so nice to have another adventure with Roland, Eddie, Susannah, Jake, and Oy! Also, there are a number of books with very strong ties to this series, I mean all of his books are, but I the following are my favorites and I recommend you check them out if you already haven't:   Insomnia Hearts In Atlantis The Talisman (with Peter Straub) Black House (The Talisman pt. 2) Ur From a Buick 8 Bag of Bones The Stand Eyes of the Dragon   I hope you enjoyed the quest as much as I did, may it do ya fine! Long days and pleasant nights!"

stephenking,3bgy9g,jefferyffe,5,Mon Jun 29 03:18:27 2015 UTC,"What he gets a glimpse of is a place between space and time, which in the King universe is known as the ""Todash Space"" where extra-dimensional entities like IT and the Crimson King come from. But in Revival it's much more in line with Lovecraft's concept of cosmic extra-dimensional ancient aliens who are so vastly powerful they're basically gods.   Revival is basically King's attempt at something like The Reanimator, which was just Lovecraft's take on Frankenstein. It's the idea that if you try to bring someone back from the dead you still lack the ability to provide the body with a soul, so the body comes back evil and acts as a vessel for powers beyond your understanding."
stephenking,3bgy9g,KicksButtson,2,Mon Jun 29 05:33:42 2015 UTC,"Thank you for explaining. I enjoyed the book until the end, then my internal movie version of the book turned into chaos, and I had no idea what I was reading."
stephenking,3bgy9g,mitten-troll,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:00:42 2015 UTC,So then I would ask do people really go there when they die in King's universe?
stephenking,3bgy9g,KicksButtson,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:40:52 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily, that's just what the main character thinks. He thinks he saw a glimpse into the world of the dead, but it's not really."
stephenking,3bgy9g,KicksButtson,2,Mon Jun 29 05:44:46 2015 UTC,It just drives me crazy thinking that some of King's characters would go there. like Bev Marsh or Claire-bear.
stephenking,3bgy9g,KicksButtson,5,Mon Jun 29 05:50:20 2015 UTC,"They won't go there. I think the main character of Revival was looking at what he experienced from a very monotheistic point of view, which would make sense given his upbringing. Revival is based in Lovecraft mythology but the characters come at the issue with an understanding of Christian mythology. So if the main character gets a glimpse into an afterlife he's likely to assume it is the only afterlife.  In reality the Todash space is NOT an afterlife. It's where extra-dimensional ancient beings are reborn and recycled. That's why IT can never really be killed, he just goes back to the Todash space to be born again."
stephenking,3bgy9g,Tia00017,2,Mon Jun 29 06:55:39 2015 UTC,Oh I see. I didn't want any of the women from Revival going there. It made the ending particularly poignant t me. I wanted them to be happy and living on clouds not in the Todash Space. I think I need to read more King.

stephenking,3bclyb,I_LIKE_LIGHTS,3,Sun Jun 28 03:31:45 2015 UTC,I also read them out of order.  Duma Key was the first King book in a long time to creep me out and read with the light on.  I loved the slow build of the characters and the story.  I will probably revisit it again.
stephenking,3bclyb,shimmycat,2,Sun Jun 28 04:37:33 2015 UTC,Don't you kind of have to read with the lights on?

stephenking,3bclyb,FoxJitter,2,Tue Jun 30 20:38:53 2015 UTC,Duma Key probably has some of the best charecterisation put on paper. Or my favourite at least.   Glad you enjoyed it.

I've seen him drop a comment on sites or send email that a few people have gotten. I seem to recall that some guy has a conspiracy theory that Stephen King killed John Lennon. King wrote him denying that he killed Lennon ( http://lennonmurdertruth.com). So maybe there is a chance he might.

I think Danse Macabre, but it might have been on a forward to one of his other books. Anyhow, he wrote about how these things happen sometimes and his feelings about it was that the reader should just roll with it. The example he gave was in Robinson Crusoe where Crusoe wakes up naked on a beach, swims to a plane crashed in the water, and fill his pockets with things to bring back to land. Whoops. Crusoe must also be a kangaroo."

stephenking,3b00vn,wizzzrd,2,Wed Jun 24 23:22:36 2015 UTC,I read them every couple years too. I'm 31 and started The Gunslinger when I was 22. The series got me through an early aged divorce. The physical books I've read twice and I listen to them quite a bit. Twice all the through. The Stand is another I read all the time. I'm on Insomnia now. Black House was fantastic too. Better than The Talisman in my opinion. I just love all the connections. I think my favorite DT book would have to be Wizard and Glass or Wolves. I really enjoyed Kurosawa's Seven Samurai and The Magnificent Seven so Wolves was really easy to get into.

No idea what the 'big bad' monster or maguffin would be though, but that's why he's the bestselling author."

Yet, the novel for The Hobbit was just over 300 pages and The Stand clocks in four times that at around 1200 depending on the version.   Yeah, I don't think four movies for a 1200 page novel is a stretch, comparatively.   EDIT - Grammar."
stephenking,3aywex,thejonnyMAGNUM,2,Wed Jun 24 17:42:28 2015 UTC,I had issues with the logic of comparing The Hobbit to The Stand. 1200 pages can easily be four movies.

stephenking,3av3pg,acassese,2,Wed Jun 24 02:10:22 2015 UTC,average i'd say is $147 but some shows offer discount tix.
stephenking,3av3pg,Lilusa,2,Wed Jun 24 03:28:52 2015 UTC,You can get discount tickets (though usually not great seats) through a non profit called TKTS.  I saw a Broadway play (Race starring Eddie Izzard in 2010) for about $70 a ticket and an off Broadway musical (Avenue Q in 2010) for about $60 a ticket.  Mary Poppins (2010) on Broadway was about $100 regular price per ticket.
stephenking,3av3pg,Purdaddy,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:18:08 2015 UTC,I'd ballpark between 100-200 per ticket.

stephenking,3av3pg,Purdaddy,2,Wed Jun 24 02:20:10 2015 UTC,"? No one said you had to travel to see it. The price was asked and I gave a ballpark answer typical to what I've paid for tickets in the past. Like I said, it's Broadway, being a Broadway show automatically pumps up the ticket price. The only way you'll ever get them for ""cheap"" is the TKTS booth (generally) but seeing as this is a limited showing it probably won't make it there. Just some general info for anyone not familiar.   It also might pop up in different areas if it does well, but with different actors. I believe it started at the Paper Mill Playhouse in NJ."

stephenking,3auf4q,Eiyran,3,Tue Jun 23 16:24:29 2015 UTC,"I literally just finished Revival, and I have nothing but great things to say about it.  I would definetly reccomend it.  It's one thing when your mother who hates Stephen King says ""can I read that once you're done?""  Fair warning, it's not a feel good book, similar vibe to Dr. Sleep.  I could reccomend others, what types of horror do you like? Do you like supernatural, creature, apocalyptic, etc?"
stephenking,3auf4q,Tia00017,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:40:45 2015 UTC,"Glanced at a summary for Revival-- it sounds pretty interesting, I might give that a shot.  Generally I enjoy supernatural and lovecraftian-styled horror-- I really enjoyed the Overlook as kind of an eldritch-horror-building, in the Shining. And the 'Empty Devils' as humanoid abominations in Doctor Sleep were really what hooked me into the story, there.  I tend to like fiction that has a heavy theme of unnatural or supernatural phenomenon present, as opposed to works where things are 'mostly' mundane, with maybe a hint of the bizarre.  Thank you for your advice!"
stephenking,3auf4q,Tia00017,3,Tue Jun 23 22:46:32 2015 UTC,Then Revival would definetly be up your alley.  Definitely supernatural.  Pet semetry is another supernatural book.  If you want a longer read try Under The Dome   Like The Walking Dead? Try Cell  Want older King work with vampires? Salems Lot is a definite read  Want a story about Evil doppelgangers? The Dark half.  Will update list as I think of more.  Edit:Auto correct doesn't like some titles

Set aside 1 or 2 days (took me 2 days) to sit down and read all the way through.  It's a suspensful read, that will drag you in and won't release you until the last sentence."
stephenking,3auf4q,VaranusNiloticus,2,Tue Jun 23 23:14:31 2015 UTC,"I think The Eyes of the Dragon is not only a good read for an atypical fan, but also a good read if you have never read fantasy.  It is just a great fantasy book."

stephenking,3au16n,Melkor666,7,Tue Jun 23 14:36:51 2015 UTC,"Well, I loved It but I cant speak for why anyone else does.  I think the backstories provide context for everything that happens later in the book.  The reason I love it is because you get 2 parallel stories that build to climax together. And as far as the ""underage gangbang"" I've always thought that a reason for that (and other disturbing scenes) is to do just that, disturb you.  So if you felt uncomfortable or a bit off while reading it I think that scene actually did its job."
stephenking,3au16n,SGT_BUTTSTICK,2,Tue Jun 23 14:51:26 2015 UTC,"I think the gang bang actually represented something, like their transition to adulthood or their love for each other.  I don't think it was just to bother you"
stephenking,3au16n,Ryall132,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:21:43 2015 UTC,"Well of course theres the whole innocence of youth being corrupted etc etc but that can be represented in other ways, I think the reason it was chosen to be shown this way was to disturb or make the reader feel a little uncomfortable"
stephenking,3au16n,SGT_BUTTSTICK,2,Tue Jun 23 15:35:51 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but I feel he doesn't write in that manner.  In ""on writing"" he says the book writes itself.  He just follows the characters and reports the actions.  Dont get me wrong, you could be totally right, but I can't imagine him purposely putting in a child orgy just to discomfort a reader"
stephenking,3au16n,Ryall132,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:34:12 2015 UTC,"I agree. I find the Dark Tower to be illuminating on that scene as well. The ideas of Ka and Ka-tet tie in...so I didn't find the gangbang as disturbing as I probably would have if I didn't have such insights that King provides elsewhere.   It's weird, but I could understand why it happened when it did...and it didn't bother me much at all."
stephenking,3au16n,Cajinmagic,3,Fri Jun 26 19:39:36 2015 UTC,"The reason It is my favorite book is because it capitalizes on the childish fear we all had. When I read It, I felt the way I did when I was a kid and those sweaters in my closet looked a lot more sinister. It took me back to that time when I couldn't rationalize the fear away."
stephenking,3au16n,X0xbarcodex0X,3,Tue Jun 23 16:05:27 2015 UTC,"It and The Stand are Kings best books. Both have a large cast of characters with detailed backstories, each has its own unique and engrossing atmosphere. The setting of Derry, with the constant presence of the clown and the tone of dread is enthralling.   The Losers Club is an amazing story of childhood friendship as well."

stephenking,3au16n,happyclownbot,2,Wed Jun 24 23:50:53 2015 UTC,"Recommend 11/22/63, it's my favorite King book.  Plus since it being a bit newer shows King hasn't lost his stuff and in fact is improving his craft."
stephenking,3au16n,DeepRoast,2,Tue Jun 23 16:00:23 2015 UTC,"First of all, your age can be relevant to loving It or not - it's a coming-of-age story as much as anything else, and about the isolation of being young and unpopular, and the joy of finding friends who understand you.  I'm not saying adults can't enjoy it, but for most of deep the fans of the book, we found it when we were quite young readers ourselves.  Then there are the back stories.  King's major strength as a writer is creating characters, and he often uses 'superfluous' characters to tell a backstory, set a scene or create atmosphere; they might not seem directly related to the main story, but in the case of It, they all told the story of Derry, and I can't think of an instance where they don't add some angle of interest regarding the town, its history or its inhabitants.  I cannot explain, defend or decrypt the gang-bang scene.  It was just trippy.  If you prefer your stories one-track and without extraneous characters, try Misery.  It's brilliant and more closely focussed than his longer works."
stephenking,3au16n,city17_dweller,2,Tue Jun 23 16:07:28 2015 UTC,"I've always thought what you're calling irrelevant backstories were world building. They define the corruption that IT has brought to Derry, ME and the effect it's had on the people.  It has spoiled or contaminated the whole area.   This corruption of Derry carries over into other Stephen King books. As recently as 11/22/63 Derry is used as a comparison and contrast to the corruption and blight that Jake experiences in Dallas.    I do believe some of what you're experiencing is a matter of personal taste/opinion. I really enjoy King's ability to develop characters and make them come to life in words.  Others can find his pace at doing this slow. I would suggest finding one of his collections of short stories or novellas and seeing if you like them. I've enjoyed them all, but Skeleton Crew stands out as a favorite."
stephenking,3au16n,iiredsoxii,2,Tue Jun 23 20:01:44 2015 UTC,"IMO, IT evokes the emotional fullness of childhood in post-war America (at least the childhood I remember from the 70s) as accurately as any work of fiction outside of DANDELION WINE or SOMETHING WICKED....  The novel touched me on so many levels: As a coming-of-age story, as a lovely portrayal of the passion of young friendship and love (along with ""The Body, "" IT made me actually ache for lost childhood and innocence) , as a Lovecraftian tale of almost unimaginable (and eternal) evil -- but mostly, IT showcases what King does best: Limning characters with incredible detail and empathy, then throwing them into absolute horror.  In themes, style, voice, setting, King has always been a quintessentially ""American"" writer, and I believe IT to be quintessential King."

stephenking,3au16n,Chromebrew,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:16:49 2015 UTC,"The sheer depth of the characters.   For example ""It"" alone when comparing the movie vs book.  In the movie you think it's some kind of mind controlling dinosaur spider.  In the book it's more of a demi-god spanning space and time only showing a  projection on Earth.    Then the characters themselves both young/old are given such a rich history."
stephenking,3au16n,DeepRoast,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:59:07 2015 UTC,"Like most of King's work its the character development.  There's some decent horror, some interesting choices that I hadn't seen before (running a train in the context it was used it) but overall, like with most of his work, its the character development."
stephenking,3au16n,clwestbr,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:26:30 2015 UTC,"I've always felt IT was overrated as well. Not bad, by any means, but certainly overwrought, even by King's standards."

So go read dean koontz ya crazy dutch bastard!
stephenking,3apx7z,chillbill69,3,Mon Jun 22 15:31:29 2015 UTC,Looks good to me (I own 8 that I know to be authentic). Where is it from?  Like someone else says it is a little sloppy but I think when he did the Dr. Sleep event he just signed a bunch at one time and naturally when you sign your name a few hundred times in a row it's not going to be identical every time.
stephenking,3apx7z,Yamchu,3,Mon Jun 22 17:51:49 2015 UTC,"My dad picked it up in some small, back-alley book shop in Canada when he went to Toronto this past week. The shop had a whole section for signed books.  It definitely looks a little sloppy, but I'm hoping that's his signature evolving over the years."
stephenking,3apx7z,sudin,2,Mon Jun 22 18:18:20 2015 UTC,how much was it ?
stephenking,3apx7z,AgentDL,3,Tue Jun 23 10:50:51 2015 UTC,$42 Canadian dollars. That's about $33 USD.
stephenking,3apx7z,mmmmpork,4,Tue Jun 23 13:31:40 2015 UTC,Looks to be genuine.
stephenking,3apx7z,SystemCrashOverRide,-1,Mon Jun 22 16:31:56 2015 UTC,On what basis? That it looks like his real signature? How do you know that it's not just a really good forgery?
stephenking,3apx7z,chillbill69,2,Tue Jun 23 11:19:16 2015 UTC,"People who make their living identifying signatures basically just do comparisons against known signatures. They use a magnifying glass & search out the ""unique"" points of the signature in question, to see if they match against the known signatures.  Here's the thing though, if you signed your name 100 times in a row, or just once or twice per day until you hit 100 times.... Each of those signatures would be different. They would look similar and have many of the same identifying characteristics, but they would not be exact copies of each other.   Even people who sign their name a lot (I used to sign mine between 100-150 times a day for my old job) will see an often noticeable difference in their signature, even through out a single day. It's kind of a balance between muscle memory & fatigue.  There's no way to tell for sure if a signature is real or fake, a good fake can be passed off as real if the forgery is done well. Conversely, a real signature can be deemed as a fake if the signer was having an off day or just something slightly different than they normally do."
stephenking,3apx7z,SystemCrashOverRide,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:49:10 2015 UTC,"It's not an ideal example, but I believe it to be legit. His signature has degraded a fair bit over time (most notably the ""ing"" in King). This is a copy of revival Dr.Sleep, so it's a recent book and looks like his recent signature. Keep in mind that he sometimes has to sign hundreds of copies in a row and the signature can get relatively sloppy. Still, there's a large market of fakes for King, so if you can verify where it came from? That's the best way. And if someone says they were at a signing event, ask to see a ticket stub or photo (not a generic one, one that proves that THEY were there)."

stephenking,3apnkm,Hello_Cup,9,Mon Jun 22 14:10:31 2015 UTC,"I believe it comes down to 2 things: the doors are aware of their master's  (Roland's) intent, and are also ruled by Ka.  I'm listening through the series again for about the 10th time,  and this time I'm focusing on the theory that Ka is completely and utterly nothing but the intent of the writer.  When the writer wants or needs something to happen in the story, that is the complete definition of Ka. I'm not sure is true,  but that's my theory for this round of listening."

The entire book is sexually charged, and It is so alien because kids at their ages are constantly grappling with the huge concept of sexuality and where they fit.   THIS JUST OCCURRED TO ME: The reason the parents don't see anything It does may be a reflection on how sex Ed is handled in the U.S. Adults gloss over it and try to avoid the whole situation."

So he had to watch in terror for an eternity, and once he got out, he could finally end the terror.  Does that make sense, or am I grasping at straws?"
stephenking,3am0u4,smoothisfast22,4,Sun Jun 21 20:29:21 2015 UTC,"If you take into account Dark Tower cosmology he probably went through ""todash space"" and saw some horrific creatures."

stephenking,3am0u4,Lucky_leprechaun,6,Sun Jun 21 23:26:12 2015 UTC,It's the empty space between universes... which isn't always empty (has horrific monsters).
stephenking,3am0u4,stop_saying_content,2,Mon Jun 22 00:23:44 2015 UTC,Okay. Thanks.
stephenking,3am0u4,deviger,3,Mon Jun 22 02:21:50 2015 UTC,"It's possible he also saw ""nothing"" and coming back to reality any sight at all was an overload on his mind, so he destroyed his own eyes."

stephenking,3aiygq,frostfromfire,7,Sun Jun 21 06:46:03 2015 UTC,Such a lovely note.  Bittersweet to think of the sentiment and realize that someone probably donated this book because the relationship failed.

Smothering his baby brother was probably the worst part. As a father I know that infants often fart when they are yawning or straining, so that added detail of the little fart when Patrick is smothering him really made it hit home. Follow that with animal cruelty and the It-leeches flying out of the fridge-- probably the scariest manifestation of It in the book-- and you have a whole big bag of nope."

It's a good example of how you're loathe to start the next chapter because it's moving you from the storyline you're invested in only to feel the same way at the end of the next chapter.

A lot of people here already own guns. so people who don't own guns are constantly buying guns to protect themselves from the other people with them. It's a cycle, really. People like to act like there's a dichotomy when talking about gun control. They seem to either land on the side of ""ban everything but muskets."" or the side of ""I should be able to own a bazooka if I want."" Rational people (who are often the ones least heard) tend to be between the two. maybe requiring more strict background checks or making private party sales without background checks illegal.   and since people often wonder I'll go ahead and answer, banning all guns won't work because most likely the people that the government would be trying to take them away from would just wind up being the only ones with guns."

stephenking,3af251,MercurialForce,2,Fri Jun 19 20:19:41 2015 UTC,How exactly would you be handicapped by losing the right to own a semi-automatic weapon? In what instance would you need a semi-automatic? The odds of someone happening to be carrying a semi-auto at the exact moment to stop a crazy person with a semi-auto are practically nil.
stephenking,3af251,npotash,2,Fri Jun 19 20:34:14 2015 UTC,"In what instance would you need a semi-automatic   If you genuinely think there is no time you would need a semi-auto  instead of a bolt or pump action I don't think there is anything I can say to change your mind. You will never have the experiences that will help you understand, since you won't be familiar enough with them to know the difference All I can ask is that you try to find someone who is professionally involved with firearms and ask them why they might need a semi-auto. Anyone who shoots competitively, especially by international standards, the ""sporting purposes"" you mention, will also be fine.   The correct answer is ""any time you might need more than one shot"" which is also ""any time you might need one shot"" because humans do not shoot the same way they do in movies, nor do they go down as quickly as they do in movies.    Nobody needs freedom of speech, nobody needs freedom of religion, nobody needs the right to privacy. People need a little food and a little water and that is it. We have rights for what we deserve, not need, and the reason a semi-ban would be struck down in any court it entered is because without repealing 2A first, it will simply be illegal and unconstitutional since from any professional or technical standpoint it does do extreme detriment to any possible reason you could want or need a firearm.   The odds that you'll run into someone during a mass shooting and die are nil. Microscopic, statistically insignificant. If 24 hr news didn't like to play with the bodies for ratings you wouldn't even be aware of them. The fact that people are willing to trade away rights piece by piece for an illusion of safety against statistically insignificant threats is a sign of the times but its a rather disgusting one.  I just answered why we ""need"" semi auto functions, and its not limited to rifles. When the matter is looked at rationally it cripples everything a firearm is meant to do. Its like saying a one armed boxer can still fight. Sure, he can, but anyone remotely familiar with boxing can tell he is still crippled. All modern pistols and almost all revolvers are semi auto. Asking me the same question again won't get a new answer just because you didn't understand the technical element of it. I think most antis just really don't understand the nuts and bolts of the matter (much like legislators)."
stephenking,3af251,IDGAF1203,5,Fri Jun 19 21:17:38 2015 UTC,"But when would anyone need ""more than one shot"". When would anyone, besides farmers, need any sort of gun, be it pump action, bolt action, or semi-automatic?  As a non-American, it's bizarre to me that the consensus seems to be that the right to own guns is just as important as things like freedom of speech, religion etc. I have no intention of telling Americans how they should act or that they're wrong, but I just struggle to understand the mentality behind gun laws in the USA.  If there were incontrovertible proof that, were the USA to ban guns, the homicide rate would drop from 4.7 per 100,000 (the USA rate in 2012) to, say, 1 (the French rate in 2012) - in other words, a nearly 80% reduction - would you support that ban?  (I'm not suggesting at all that this would be the actual result of such a ban as I know the situation in the USA is very different from Europe)"
stephenking,3af251,theyterkourjerrbs,4,Fri Jun 19 21:48:29 2015 UTC,"Men with knives don't do as they please. The idea that Europe is full of knife-wielding thugs who go around stabbing people unopposed is a complete myth. In fact, taking the UK as an example (being British, it's the country I can say the most about), the number of knife deaths in 2014 was 237, or a rate of 0.37 per 100,000, compared to 1,694 knife deaths in the USA in 2011 (the most recent data I could find), or a rate of 0.53. In other words, even without guns, the UK still has a lower knife homicide rate.  Then we get to the gun homicide rate - a rate of 3.55 for the USA in 2013 compared to just 0.04 for the UK in 2010 - almost 90x more. Clearly, gun crime in the US is a lot more serious a problem than knife crime in the UK (and Europe in general), so let's get back to the gun issue.  Please correct me if I'm wrong on this, but to me it seems that the problem that the USA has with guns is a vicious circle, where there are lots of guns about, so people get more guns to protect themselves, meaning that criminals who want to overpower that protection get even more guns and so on. It would therefore seem to me that, by putting a ban in place and therefore taking a sizeable chunk of that total number of guns out of circulation, you can break the cycle. If there are less guns about, they become more expensive to get. Even for those people who don't give up their guns, like criminals, the ammo will become too expensive to use with any regularity, reducing the usefulness of firearms.  I checked out /r/dgu and looked at the front page. I don't know how you can claim that it's ""the ""boring"" stuff that doesn't have a body count"" - most stories posted there seem to result in the criminal being killed and I only read one where nobody was shot. How exactly is that good? If the typical stories on there ever happened in the UK, I guarantee you they would make national news. It seems to me that gun violence has become so commonplace in the USA that many Americans don't see how much of a problem it really is.   Where does it stop? In that world, if I tear up the constitution, can I reduce the murder rate to zero?   Why is ""tearing up the constitution"" seen as such a bad thing in America? It's nearly 230 years old - obviously there's going to be parts of it that fall out of relevance, or other issues that need to be addressed years later. You're using the same sort of argument that was used against the amendments which abolished slavery and gave women the right to vote by saying that constitutional change is inherently bad.   Will they take all my kitchen knives, or will they bundle us all into our own neat little cells?   Now you're just being overdramatic. I know Redditors in general have little faith in their Governments, but do you seriously think that the logical consequence of a gun ban is that they would go completely ban crazy like you are suggesting? The UK banned guns in 1997. I assure you we still have kitchen knives aplenty and, as far as I know, I am not living in a little cell. You seem to be suggesting that a gun ban is not worth it unless the murder rate would be reduced to zero, which seems silly to me. It seems a little selfish to me that so many Americans would rather keep their guns than contribute to a significant reduction in crime.   I find Europeans have a very hard time relating to the warrior culture in America   The what? I'm not quite sure what you mean by that. The phrase 'warrior culture' makes me think of Mad Max or something similar, and I'm pretty sure that's not what you mean (at least I hope not).    The balance between freedom and safety is one we each need to calculate   Very true - I'll refer to the Four Freedoms that FDR talked about and which are enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  The first three - Freedom of Speech, Freedom of Worship, Freedom from Want (ie the right to an adequate standard of living) - both the USA and the UK largely have no problem with. The UK has a bit less freedom of speech than the USA, and the USA has a little less freedom from want than the UK, but both do well when compared with most of the rest of the world. The fourth freedom is Freedom from Fear. I know that I certainly have that. I have no fear of being shot in the street or in my home. Obviously I cannot speak for you or your fellow Americans, but your response here seems to indicate that you do have a fear of you or those close to you being shot. If this is the case, then America is failing to provide this freedom from fear to the best of its ability. If this isn't the case; if you are not worried about shootings, then I'll my very first question again: why would you need a gun?     BTW, you didn't actually answer my question about a ban. I didn't ask where it would stop, or about the secondary consequences. I specifically stated that it was a hypothetical situation where the only factor to consider was the guaranteed 80% drop in homicide rate."

Really? Besides, almost no one calling for a ban on semi-automatic weapons wants a blanket ban that wipes out everything that can fire more than once without reloading. The focus is mainly on weapons that have military features or have magazines that can hold more than ten rounds. How often do you need more than ten shots?    a semi-ban would be struck down in any court   This bit just isn't true. The Federal Assault Weapons Ban prohibited many kinds of semi-autos from 1994 until it expired in 2004 and all constitutional challenges against it failed. It was never challenged under the Second Amendment, but it's debatable whether or not it would have been struck down.."

The second amendment was created when people used simple muskets and pistols. I don't think that the Founding Fathers would agree with having a machine gun just to keep in a safe for bragging rights. Sure, keep a shotgun and pistol for hunting or just protection but I don't believe anybody needs an AR-15 just to keep on their house."
stephenking,3af251,NinjaloForever,2,Sat Jun 20 00:31:12 2015 UTC,"people used simple muskets   Yes, those were the cutting edge scary black assault rifles of their time. Home defense was never considered a reason to own firearms under the second amendment. It is explicitly for military grade hardware, i.e. maintaining a militia, which by definition does very little actual fighting (i.e., their guns sit in safes). So I don't think you want to drag them into this.   nobody needs an AR-15   Nobody needs freedom of speech, nobody needs freedom of religion, nobody needs the right to privacy. People need a little food and a little water and that is it. We have rights for what we deserve, not need. If you live more than 5 minutes from a police station there very may well come a time where you need a semi-auto weapon, its a far, far more likely event than you being killed randomly by a crazy person in a mass shooting. There is nothing special about the AR-15, except that it is common and cheap. Its just a semi-auto rifle, one used in a disproportionately low number of crimes for just how common it is."

The CDC says there were 11,000 gun related homicides in 2013,   Most sources say there were around 30,000 traffic fatalities in 2013  The article he references is pretty alarmist/hyperbolic. It pulls a pretty damned dishonest (and frankly, insulting) statistical trick; lumps the most humane (and common) way a person can commit suicide under ""firearm violence"" so you come up with ""scary numbers"" about how evil guns are instead of recognizing that 2,500,000 people die in the US every year and many of them to problems far more preventable and addressable than murder (Auto-accidents and homicide aren't even in the top 10 causes of death).   Relinquishing your rights to maybe save a few is pretty bad math, because there is no reason someone who isn't a hypocrite wouldnt take that thinking to its logical conclusion: if safety is our primary concern I don't see why we bother having any rights at all. If the police could ransack wherever they wanted and hold people indefinitely without charge we would all be safer, and in reality that would likely do far more than banning guns would for the murder rate if a numbers reduction is our only concern.   If we would gag the media on mass-killings and limit the time they devote to the piece of dog shit committing them, the same media that gives them exactly what they wanted by spreading their hateful message to everyone and plastering their stupid face everywhere, we would do far more to curb mass killings than banning firearms or semi-automatics...but the media has chosen guns as a convenient scapegoat and people eat it up instead of recognizing the steadily decreasing trend in homicides yet increasing coverage of them...I wonder what they'll do if they actually succeed, and people start using explosives instead...probably blame gas stations and hardware stores, if people will be stupid enough to buy that, too...

stephenking,3af251,Canadamatt2230,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:56:55 2015 UTC,"King says fire arm fatalities, not fire arm homicides. If you include suicide, the amount of gun related deaths if 32,383, which puts it ahead of traffic fatalities, exactly as he stated.   The reason people choose guns as a means for suicide is because they are so readily available. Removing a gun from a home greatly reduces the risk of suicide for everybody in the house, and may lead to actual treatment of the depression, so the number of suicide deaths should 100% be counted when talking about firearm fatalities, and not as a scare tactic."

My personal theory is this: that Roland saves the tower every time, it's his destiny.  The tower, in return, is trying to save Roland.  One of these circuits (maybe the one with the horn, maybe the next one or the next one), Roland finds redemption at the top of the tower.  Perhaps his ka-tet are all there with him...

stephenking,3ab98f,beard_meat,10,Thu Jun 18 19:02:49 2015 UTC,"Will the horn alter anything at all in your opinion?   I'm copy/pasting my idea about what happens now that Roland has the horn that I wrote in another thread about a year ago:   When Jake is hanging over the edge of the pit, Roland feels the weight of the horn on his hip and is reminded of Cuthbert and Alain and of his duty as the last of the line of Eld and decides to save Jake and let the man in black go. Jake becomes Roland's apprentice and the two go off in search of the Tower. After a long journey, maybe even as long as the ten years between The Gunslinger and The Drawing of the Three, they find the path of the Beam which will lead them to the Tower. Since Walter never left him unconscious on the beach, Roland never loses the fingers on his right hand and can still fight with it. At some point they find the magic doors that lead Eddie and Susannah to Mid-World. Oy joins the crew as he did before. Since they don't need to draw Jake into the world, Susannah is never raped by the demon and Mordred is never created. With his good right hand still intact, Roland is quick enough to take out Randall Flagg in the Emerald City By the time they reach Calla Bryn Sturgis, Jake is a confident and capable gunslinger who has been training for years. He is able to keep the sneetches off of Benny Slightman and save his life after he panics and dashes out of the foxhole. Since there is no Mordred and no Mia, Jake and the Pere don't need to go into the Dixie Pig and the Pere isn't killed by the Grandfathers. In the aftermath of the battle of Agul Siento, in this cycle, Roland is capable of fighting with both hands, Jake has been traveling with Roland for a longer time and is more skilled at fighting, and the Pere is also there to help. So the ka-tet has a little bit more on its side this time around, and it's enough that somebody notices that Pimli Prentiss is reaching for his gun and takes him out before he can shoot Eddie. Roland and Eddie go off together to save Stephen King. Since Eddie knows how to drive, they save a few valuable seconds and manage to save King without the need for anyone to sacrifice himself. The last leg of the quest for the Tower is similar to the previous cycle; the six are able to easily figure out that Dandelo is up to no good and rescue Patrick Danville, who helps take out the Crimson King. When Roland reaches the Tower, his ka-tet is whole. Either this is enough to satisfy the Tower/Gan and let him into the room at the top, or the tet is able to convince Roland that his quest is complete after saving the beam, killing the Crimson King, and entering the tower. He leaves without trying the room at the top and the cycle is broken. They all lived happily ever after.   Like I said, I think this would be the best-case scenario. Maybe Jake, Eddie, Susannah, Oy and Callahan are out of the picture and Roland will have a different ka-tet, but I suspect not. Here are a few problems I see with this story though:   No ruger, no bullets. Without the second Jake, they wouldn't have had the ruger, and Roland and Jake would have had to travel without much ammo at least until they found Eddie and Susannah. I think if Roland were not suffering from the infected lobstrosity wounds, he could have gotten Eddie or Susannah to collect more supplies, including weapons and ammo before crossing over. And since gunslingers are said to be skilled with all kinds of weapons, maybe he and Jake use bows or bahs until they come across the doors. Without Flagg putting Roland on the beach, they might never go to where the doors are. But I think that since the doors are magical, ka will find a way to put Eddie and Susannah onto the team if that's what it wants. The time might not line up without Roland's ten-year nap, but especially since time in Mid-World is all screwy anyway, I think that that might not be an issue at all. What happens to Black Thirteen if Jake and the Pere never put it in the storage locker? Perhaps they could find another way to be rid of it."

stephenking,3ab98f,DRUMSKIDOO,5,Sat Jun 20 08:20:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd love to watch a miniseries of a different cycle. I want to root for Roland and the crew again, not knowing what's going to happen to them.  I'd want to change a few things about my cycle idea for the screen though. Like, I'd really like to see a more mature Jake who has trained with Roland for a long time and can fight with the same skill as the Gunslingers of old. But on the other hand, Flagg is probably my favorite Stephen King villain of all time, and I'd want him to stick around and make things hard for the gang longer than Emerald City. Same with Mordred and the Grandfathers to a lesser extent. The producers could come up with new enemies for the tet to fight, but the old ones are so memorable and I know fans would want to see them play a role.  I think one way to go about that is to invoke Black Thirteen. The Tower knows about Roldand's multiple attempts, and I imagine that Black Thirteen does too. If Roland becomes closer to salvation each cycle, Black Thirteen becomes more and more dangerous each go-round. In the hands of the enemy, it could be a major wild card. It could draw Mordred into the world from a different reality. Or it could turn Susannah into Mia and impregnate her with Mordred, and the rest of the crew would have to mount an assault on the Dixie Pig to get her back.   A lot of people complain about the ending, but I like being able to speculate about all the things that could still happen."

Roland in some way falls short of whatever/whoever he needs to be in order to achieve some kind of redemption (whatever that would look like -- I imagine it as him getting to go to alt-New York and live out the rest of his days with Eddie, Jake, Susannah, et al). Each time he goes through the cycle he gets a little better, though, so each time he starts anew he gets that little bit of extra character development credited to him.  The Roland in this latest incarnation starts out with the horn. He also says, earlier in the book, that leaving the horn behind the last time through was a result of laziness, or perhaps a result of his tendency to short-change the little things in service to the bigger picture. (""It would have taken the space of a few seconds to pick it up again."") This latest version of Roland will start out with a little bit less of a tendency to do that, and thus a little bit closer to whatever point he needs to reach to achieve redemption and break himself out of the cycle."

HiA is my particular favorite of the two, but well... I have my totally subjective reasons (and really, this was kind of a hard question... and a weird one. I can't help but ask back, why did you ask this question?)"
stephenking,3abs9u,guitarpwner,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:54:11 2015 UTC,Because I just bought the two books and wasn't sure on which one to start with.

I was curious if there was any other particular reason, because I just find strange the fact that anyone would ask a question of that nature (I imagined that maybe you thought there was a particular suggested order, or a fact that one book would spoil of the other) nothing offensive implied. Enjoy the books!"
stephenking,3abs9u,gunslinger__,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:53:42 2015 UTC,Eyes of the Dragon was my first King book and is still one of my favourites. Still haven't read Hearts in Atlantis so can't comment on that one

stephenking,3ab3n0,doctorgaines,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:40:44 2015 UTC,I quite liked this book. I see what this reviewer is saying about the major plot coincidence (it's hard to miss) but I felt it was King kind of intentionally leaning on some pulpy crime genre traditions to get to that nice tight conclusion.
stephenking,3ab3n0,Oliver_the_chimp,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:05:14 2015 UTC,I would argue his pacing on the short novels like MM and FK has always been relatively quick.
stephenking,3aa8ik,youwho42,2,Thu Jun 18 13:37:53 2015 UTC,"It's only in pre-production. Credits on IMDB are extremely unreliable, especially before a film is out. The film will have their names as will IMDB once production starts or at least by the time of release."
stephenking,3aa8ik,hiff-cluxtable,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:46:28 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I don't doubt they will get credit eventually, assuming the film gets made. At this, the imdb page for it is basically just a stub -- no cast or crew listed aside from the director/screenwriter. At this point in the life of the film, I'm sure everything can change, so there is little point fleshing out the details."

stephenking,3aa8ik,dannyisyoda,3,Thu Jun 18 13:38:38 2015 UTC,Because they are not writing the screenplay. They only wrote the story that it is based on.

stephenking,3a756w,Hugh_Jampton,23,Wed Jun 17 19:24:07 2015 UTC,The long walk is King's best work IMO
stephenking,3a756w,jl45,6,Wed Jun 17 20:04:00 2015 UTC,"Not the best, but up there. That book is unforgettable. You can't help but imagine what it would be like. I pulled a leg muscle the other day, and wondered if I could keep walking fast enough to avoid being shot."
stephenking,3a756w,eltoro,2,Wed Jun 17 22:39:19 2015 UTC,I stayed up all night to finish that story. I felt like Garrity himself at the end.
stephenking,3a756w,stop_saying_content,4,Thu Jun 18 03:25:41 2015 UTC,"IT's a great novella but ""best work"" is a hell of a leap IMO. Several of his other novels are far better than TLW. Misery, for one, is a masterpiece.  The Dark Tower is his best work as far as I'm concerned. I'd go so far as to say that it's the best epic written since The Hobbit or Lord of the Rings."

stephenking,3a756w,Rev_Jim_lgnatowski,8,Wed Jun 17 22:26:05 2015 UTC,"I like the books, sure. What I like best about them is that they actually feel different -- it's not just King writing under a fake name, they actually read like a (slightly) different writer."
stephenking,3a756w,evilgenius815,6,Wed Jun 17 21:07:16 2015 UTC,"Have only read Thinner and Roadwork but I loved them both. Echoing what others have said here, it's like King's alter-ego, unmarried, drunk, unhappy.."
stephenking,3a756w,butter_wizard,3,Thu Jun 18 00:22:44 2015 UTC,I would really recommend you read the long walk. One of King's (or Bachman's) best stories I think.
stephenking,3a756w,Assassino74,5,Thu Jun 18 10:11:11 2015 UTC,The best of his work imo.  As king he forces me to like the protagonist.  Bachman does not.  I appreciate that difference.
stephenking,3a756w,Leslie_Chowder,3,Wed Jun 17 20:23:07 2015 UTC,When I finished reading the last of the Bachman books I imagined Stephen king writing a few books and not having endings for them. One night he got drunk and went nuts and started writing the darkest endings he could think of. These became the Bachman Books.   Obviously thats not what happened but it makes me laugh and feel good about the Bachman books. Plus there great books anyway.
stephenking,3a756w,TheWildRover_,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:35:36 2015 UTC,That's a good way to imagine it!

Thinner was good, but much more in the vein of a ""normal"" King book. I think he'd gotten the dystopian sci-fi/crime thriller stuff largely out of his system by then, and if he'd continued any future Bachman books would've just been ""King w/ a twist."""

stephenking,3a7sw2,DeviState,3,Thu Jun 18 01:31:21 2015 UTC,Agreed.  The Shining is an amazing book that stayed with me a decade after finishing it and only reading it once.  I did not enjoy Salem's Lot when I read it and couldn't wait til I would put it down for good.
stephenking,3a7sw2,DeviState,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:52:30 2015 UTC,"The two best Stephen King books are the Shining and the Stand. I have read all his books some multiple times but for some reason these are the only two that stay with me. The characters, the stories the location everything about them is what a great novel should be."
stephenking,3a7sw2,DeviState,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:22:11 2015 UTC,"I'm curious where you rank Hearts in Atlantis.    SPOILERS ABOUT THE BOOK FOLLOW  It's my all time favorite book ever.  I think it far surpasses both The Shining and The Stand imo.  Bobby Garfield, Carol Gerber and ted Brautigan were amazing characters.  I'd love another book with any of those characters.  And I'm so glad we got to see Bobby and Carol become adults in the end."
stephenking,3a7sw2,DeviState,2,Thu Jun 18 03:53:28 2015 UTC,Oh yea completely forgot about Hearts in Atlantis. For me it would be in the top 5 I just cant relate to it as much as the Stand for some reason. That's one ill have to read again as its been too long.

I never really enjoyed 11/22/63 to be honest it was well written but the story is not one i can really relate to in anyway, I guess I never really understood the whole Kennedy thing not being American."
stephenking,3a7sw2,redraygun12,2,Thu Jun 18 04:00:49 2015 UTC,IMHO salem's lot is the scariest fucking book i have ever read. i don't know precisely why but it scared the ever-loving shit out of me. the second scariest was a short story in the collection with the monkey on the cover. something about cleaning out a factory during the summer break. i did my joey impression & put it in the freezer.
stephenking,3a7sw2,xilonian,2,Thu Jun 18 03:06:03 2015 UTC,"Can't go wrong. Just read whichever one entices you more. No need for random strangers to tell you based on their own impressions.  When people ask these questions my typical response is to read whichever one was published first - which in this case is Salem's Lot - but as I initially said, you can't go wrong either way."
stephenking,3a7sw2,meat03man,2,Thu Jun 18 11:01:12 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend Salems Lot. It's not like IT at all, but the theme of returning to an old childhood place in Maine is still there. Either one is okay though becuase they are both some of his best novels."
stephenking,3a7sw2,steeljaw,2,Wed Jun 17 23:04:25 2015 UTC,I second this choice. I loved Salem's Lot!

stephenking,3a7kqh,Remotepart,10,Wed Jun 17 21:14:44 2015 UTC,"It's genre snobbery, plain and simple. People think ""horror"" and they think B-movie schlock. King has written about this a lot, actually, and how it took him a long time to shake feeling guilty about writing it. Yeah, I've had people try to make me feel bad for liking King's work, but I never let it bother me. Or try to, anyway.  (And Use Your Illusion II is a killer record, btw. At least you still got a good birthday present.)"
stephenking,3a7kqh,evilgenius815,3,Wed Jun 17 23:00:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, exactly. In a way, since SK seems like a legit good dude, it's nice to read his interviews and non-fiction pieces and to watch the way he's come to terms, over the years, with this genre snobbery. I suppose the fact that two or three times a day at this point someone just drives a dumptruck full of money up to each of SK's homes and drops a huge pile of cash in his lawn probably helps him get over the fact that Michiko Kakutani doesn't invite him to her St Swithin's Day Party. :)"

stephenking,3a7kqh,sassyfoot,3,Thu Jun 18 03:48:35 2015 UTC,"Why would the enjoyment of any fiction make you feel guilty? My mother hasn't read a novel since high school and she's 70 years old.  Most people who frown on Stephen King either haven't read him or haven't read his best work, or simply assume that he's a ""horror writer"" and therefore automatically offensive.  If the opinions of others is of sufficient importance to make anyone question -- or even feel ashamed of -- a personal preference, perhaps the issue isn't Stephen King."
stephenking,3a7kqh,veganchaos,2,Wed Jun 17 22:15:17 2015 UTC,"There are numerous reasons for this, I think. Some disapprove of horror. Some disapprove of anything that contains sex or violence. Some hoity-toity literary types look down on anything popular or ""genre.""  I personally regard a guilty pleasure as something I enjoy, while at the same time acknowledging that it's not very good. The show Smallville was a guilty pleasure for years (as was the TV series version of The Dead Zone), while shows like Buffy and Angel I both liked AND felt were legitimately good. Kingdom Hospital is another King-based show I would name that was actually good, rather than just a guilty pleasure."

It comes out and Victor sees It as Frankenstein's monster and so that snaps into place.  It swats Vic's head off and then Belch charges at It and tries to fight It and Henry runs but not before seeing It basically peel Belch's face apart.  It's jumbled because Henry is crazy.

Plus, I just don't think a Movie would do the Stand justice. It needs a hard-R super gritty 1-hour long TV show. 3 seasons at 12 episodes each.   I wonder if it would be possible to do 2-3 movies that explore the book - maybe, Movie 1) Virus 2) Going West 3) Colorado v Vegas. Or 1) Virus and Heading West 2) Settling West & Col v Vegas. (2 -2.5 hours for trilogy or 3 -3.15 for 2 films). The movies would need to leave a ton out, follow fewer characters, and focus more on the conflict than the character development.   To supplement the movies, use a mini-series that focuses on all the great side stories & characters. 3 seasons of 6-8 1 hour episodes that air along the films to build hype and to show more of the story around them. Get some of the main/movie characters to make an appearance.   Kind of like SHEILD, DareDevil, Agent Carter, etc... do with Avengers."

It's not a typical horror story though. It's elaborate and well written and the amount of detail is astounding. I'd definitely start with IT, possibly my favorite King book and the only one of his books to truly scare me. The Shining was scary and great, but it just didn't hit me as hard as IT did.  The Misery movie adaptation stays relatively true to the story and is great (especially Kathy Bates!), while IT's adaptation is slightly pathetic. Tim Curry as Pennywise was the only reason I finished that movie."

It's the same story just more fleshed out and the pop culture references are updated from the '70s to the '90s. King himself states in the introduction that the only reason why the original was edited down was for budgetary reasons, what you get in the uncut version is essentially how it was intended to be originally released. In short, just go for it and enjoy! It's an absolute must read and the Uncut version is the best way to go if you want the full story!"
stephenking,39sfph,CeRuM114,3,Sun Jun 14 09:41:54 2015 UTC,"I loved the uncut version. Whether you should start here or with the original published version kind of depends on you and whether you like the book. The uncut version fleshes out the characters and gives a lot more ""side info"" that doesn't especially advance the plot. So I guess if you find yourself getting bored, try the other one as it moves along faster."

The released Complete and Uncut version is 1152 pages. These numbers may change depending on book format though. So 300 page difference.

Overall I have to say I find it a little underwhelming as I'm not liking the narrative, the changes in some of the story line, and this last one that I read with Roland and the Not-Men felt more like a comic book story than a Dark Tower story.  I don't hate them and they're entertaining enough, but I think I would have been ok if I had never read them. It's just not the same without King writing the dialogue."

stephenking,39pbve,f_h_muffman,6,Sat Jun 13 17:54:18 2015 UTC,"The only thing you get from reading them in chronological order is following King through some of his passing phases and obsessions. Like, reading through his early '90s work in a row you'll run into a string of novels about defiant, abused women (Dolores Claiborne, Rose Madder, Gerald's Game); or a lot of his work post-van incident that focuses a lot on painful recovery from catastrophic injury (Dreamcatcher and Duma Key; some of the short fiction, too). But that's more about thematic concerns than anything else; aside from that -- and of course the Dark Tower series -- it's all pretty much standalone."
stephenking,39pbve,evilgenius815,3,Sat Jun 13 18:03:58 2015 UTC,Only thing where a reading order makes sense is the Dark Tower series.

stephenking,39ok3a,nage82,2,Sat Jun 13 17:14:34 2015 UTC,I would strongly recommend The Talisman and its sequel Black House. some may argue otherwise but i think Black House is the most Tower-ish Book King has done outside the direct Tower series.
stephenking,39ok3a,Eiyran,2,Mon Jun 15 16:13:39 2015 UTC,"Yes! I read these immediately after finishing the Dark Tower and it was a great experience. The Talisman feels similar in a lot of ways, and I picked up on certain themes and feelings that were a common thread through the books. Black House is really excellent as well, and stronger on the horror themes, whereas Talisman is more of an adventure book. Both tie into the Tower though."

Audiobook-wise, I recommend The Long Walk, one of the Bauchman books, narrated by Kirby Hayborne (11hr), and  11/22/63, narrated by Craig Wasson (31hr)."
stephenking,39ok3a,TheSilverBeetle,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:29:35 2015 UTC,"I'd say the most important would be The Stand (which I am actually reading currently for the first time), Salem's Lot, Everything's Eventual (the short story in the book of the same name), and Low Men in Yellow Coats (From Hearts in Atlantis). The Stand is important because it features Flagg and takes place in a world in which the ka-tet briefly visit (plus it is considered by a lot of fans as King's best book). The other three because characters from them become key components in Roland's quest. Eyes of the Dragon is another good one as it is referenced in The DT and also features Flagg. I also know that Insomnia is Tower related but I have not read that one yet."

stephenking,39iv1c,worthlessfucksunited,4,Fri Jun 12 04:16:42 2015 UTC,"If I'm not mistaken, King has said that Eastwood is one of the major inspirations for Roland."

stephenking,39iv1c,handawanda,2,Fri Jun 12 16:02:46 2015 UTC,"My only complaint about this guy -- and this is my biggest fear about casting Roland -- is that he's too pretty. Roland is often described as having a harsh face, for lack of a better term. ""Old long, tall and ugly."" At one point someone, maybe Susannah, comments at how surprised she is when she realizes Roland is handsome in some strange way.   That's why I'm intrigued by the talks of Michael Shannon and Javier Bardem. They both have that non-traditionally handsome look, almost a little strange looking, which I think is kinda key to Roland's character."
stephenking,39iv1c,jefferyffe,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:51:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree. That, I think, stems from King's inspiration based on Clint Eastwood who also is an untraditional look and really embodies the ""long, tall, and ugly"" part. I think Anson Mount's looks aren't spot on for Roland but I felt like his acting in Hell on Wheels showed his potential to portray Roland's personality. His attitude in that show is how I picture Roland, little humor, has a good heart, but is also ruthless at the same time. I just see a lot of potential here."

stephenking,39fwq7,no_capes,2,Thu Jun 11 23:58:12 2015 UTC,The interesting thing is that calling it The Suicide Prince coupled with the ending of Finders Keepers tells you what the third book is going to be about. The new title doesn't. Does that mean he's changed his plan for the third book?
stephenking,39fwq7,nage82,3,Sat Jun 13 02:33:13 2015 UTC,"My guess is probably the more mundane explanation that a book with the word ""Suicide"" on the cover doesn't look super great on a shelf in Wal-Mart"

stephenking,39f8lb,Purdaddy,5,Thu Jun 11 12:42:13 2015 UTC,"Reading the Wikipedia page on the topic, I was surprised to find out that post-apocalyptic themes have been around longer than I thought. I mean, it probably has never been as popular as it is now, but Mary Shelly and HG Wells are listed as influences in the pre-1900s. I haven't read any Shelly yet, but I think the term post-apocalyptic as it is presented in some of Wells' stories is quite different from the idea I get in my head when I think post-apocalyptic now. I think it could very well be that King's wide public reach with The Stand could have jump-started things in the genre again."
stephenking,39f8lb,eggsaladbob,4,Thu Jun 11 14:39:48 2015 UTC,"Nah, that genre has been around for a while."
stephenking,39f8lb,tinkersrucksack,3,Fri Jun 12 00:15:40 2015 UTC,"Whenever I see the ""ancient Indian burial ground"" trope in horror, I always think of King. I wonder if he actually originated it, or just popularized it.  I think the same thing about the ""creature from another dimension"" trope too, but I know that Lovecraft and Poe probably made those popular before King did."
stephenking,39f8lb,Bamaborn,2,Thu Jun 11 14:34:22 2015 UTC,"The ancient Indian Burial ground existed before, since it's a part of the then-horror monster ""Swamp Thing""'s background (DC comics), and that came out three years before King wrote his first book."

stephenking,39f8lb,BangoSkankAwaits,3,Thu Jun 11 22:21:43 2015 UTC,"The hate is weird, considering it isn't like SK is shy about straight up saying shit like ""Yeah, I kinda lifted this straight outta Lovecraft.""   Lovecraft was a pinch-faced, bitter, classist old bigot whose prose was so purple it frequently turned into accidental self-satire and I think it's great that King, who seems like a good guy, has made tens of trillions of dollars and had a pretty damned good life largely by mining the ideas of that fustian baboon HPL. But the fact that he did mine HPL until he ran dry and then called in the really heavy mining equipment to finish the job is literally undeniable."
stephenking,39f8lb,Tia00017,0,Fri Jun 12 12:06:48 2015 UTC,"As I said, the ""hate"" stems from the fact King fan-boys view him as some kind of god. In their eyes every single thing he has written is fantastic and original.  They simply won't entertain the fact that horror was around long before Stephen King, and as you pointed out, King himself has acknowledged that a lot of his ideas came from reading Lovecraft, Poe, Stoker, Matheson, Shirley Jackson etc.  I'm pretty sure in the introduction to Salem's Lot, King wrote something like, ""I read Bram Stoker's Dracula and wanted to bring that story to a small town in America."" He also described The Shining as, "" a bigger, ‘splodier, more dudely version of Shirley Jackson’s The Haunting of Hill House.""  Unfortunately, it seems a lot of people in this sub either have their heads in the sand and don't want to hear that King isn't the be all and end all of the horror genre, or they simply don't read anything other than Stephen King. Either way, it is very sad."
stephenking,39f8lb,themightyikari,3,Fri Jun 12 13:21:50 2015 UTC,"We don't think EVERY book is worthy of an award. Like every author he has his great book and his bad books. For me the bad ones were Dark House and Joyland. Just because you like one author, doesn't mean that you don't read other authors. I've read lots of other horror authors, and I'm sure others in this sub have as well.  We accept the fact that Kong isn't the first horror author. There's Poetry,  Shelley , Lovecraft,  Wells, and Stoker.  Yes he did borrow some monsters from previous authors. But what author doesn't?  Stoker took the idea km vampires from real history (Vladimir the Impaler) but king has come up with other original ideas. Take Under the Dome.  Who would have thought of a giant dome trapping a town? We don't think he is the king of horror (Pun intended) he's just a really good author. It's because of him that others have gotten into the horror genre. Just like I stated above,  we read other authors."

But I haven't read the dark tower series yet, so my opinion is only half valid.    I would wait on Under the Dome, it was underwhelming.    The only reason you should wait on 11/22/63 is I almost feel like it would be a shame to read so much of his absolute best work in just a year.  I like to spread out the intensely good stuff.     I recently have been reading The Tommyknockers and I would say it's a definite adventure tale.  It's been a wild ride.  I would recommend that if you haven't read it."

stephenking,39c3g9,GrabbinCowlicks,3,Wed Jun 10 19:32:16 2015 UTC,Yeah this is something I was wondering about too. King sets so many of his books in Maine that when one of them isn't set there it seems like a very deliberate decision. No idea why he wouldn't bother to name the city. Maybe because it contributes to a sense that the city is this sprawling unknowable place. The way Hodges and the gang interact with the city and its landmarks make it seem unwieldy which sort of ads to the tension/suspense/danger? I feel like i'm grasping at straws here.
stephenking,39c3g9,no_capes,2,Wed Jun 10 21:34:57 2015 UTC,"I'm glad I'm not the only one who noticed this. I did some light googling and couldn't find anything. It didn't bother me too much. But it was really noticeable.  I think you might be reaching. That would make sense if the city played a central role, or if Hodges was as much a stranger to to the city as we are. But he wasn't. Maybe King wanted to tie it all back to some kind of commentary on the economy. The City Center victims died lining up for a job fair but the city isn't named because it could be anywhere. That's the only thing I can figure."
stephenking,39c3g9,no_capes,2,Wed Jun 10 21:53:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah good point. Kind of the way the Nolan Batman trilogy deliberately and obviously shot the movies in different different cities. Makes Gotham kind of an ""anywhere USA"" type of place"
stephenking,39c3g9,jon_slush,2,Thu Jun 11 02:04:23 2015 UTC,"I think he's just going for generic mid-west city. I picture Cleveland in my head based on the size and demographics. He did the same thing in Roadwork. Both are non-supernatural, don't seem to have any hard ties to the greater SK universe and likely won't be revisited once the Hodges series is over.       SK is also less intimately familar with the mid-west, than he is with say New England, NYC, or Boulder; so he might rather make up the city than do the leg-work on researching the layout/characteristics of an existing one."
stephenking,39c3g9,chadwalters23,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:54:39 2015 UTC,"That's a good point. And the Hodges series is only 3 books so maybe if he named a fictional city, he was afraid it would overshadow Hodges' story?"

stephenking,399liu,scumbag_college,3,Wed Jun 10 15:00:13 2015 UTC,"Cujo. I absolutely hated it. An absurd amount of that book is dedicated to telling the reader about one character's job in advertising and it's completely unnecessary and unbelievably boring. Classic King padding really. I also struggled with the idea of a dog being the antagonist, first because I've always loved dogs, second because it's just a fairly silly concept. It also seemed that every character described in the book either lived in poverty, was an alcoholic, or was a domestic abuser. There was no variation and that got boring and repetitive too. I really hated that book."
stephenking,399liu,GrabbinCowlicks,2,Wed Jun 10 10:00:54 2015 UTC,"It's been a while since I read that one, but in my mind, the antagonist wasn't the dog (because I love dogs, too). It was the rabies inside the dog.  He does tend to dedicate huge chunks of the first halves of his books to character descriptions, whether they are relevant or not. That can get annoying.   every character described in the book either lived in poverty, was an alcoholic, or was a domestic abuser   This is every character in every book he ever writes, I feel like. I should make a list of all the types of ... you know what, someone's probably teaching university courses on the themes in his books...  Oh, and there's always one pyromaniac with access to tons of explosives. Once he introduces the crazy meth-head or whatever, I know the book is ending with large explosions. It's one of my pet peeves with his writing."

stephenking,399liu,paulbamf,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:38:35 2015 UTC,"I just finished Cujo a couple weeks ago. I didn't hate it by any means, but it was not my favorite.   I agree, the long excerpts about Vic's troubled career in advertising severely dragged the book down. It wasn't so much the amount of pages dedicated to it for me, it was just the lack of clarity. I think King did a really piss poor job of establishing why the company was in trouble and why Vic and his partner's idea was going to work. It felt lazy and read like King didn't understand advertising and couldn't be bothered to consult anyone about it.  But all the stuff in the Pinto worked for me. And I loved reading the passages written from Cujo's perspective.   And I really liked the chaos of the book. Cujo is the antagonist but the first half of the book sets up a bunch of threads that could lead to Tad and Donna being saved but throughout the second half, each potential lifeline gets discarded by other characters who are completely oblivious to what's going on with Cujo and the Pinto. That's what really hooked me in the book.   It's not King's best by any means. But I enjoyed myself."

The reveal of why the dome was there, the way the sheriff met his end, the way characters that King spent the 1st half writing about just died with barely a mention towards the end.

stephenking,3995iy,no_capes,2,Wed Jun 10 03:52:01 2015 UTC,"I loved Finders Keepers, it seemed really tight.  SPOILERS  I thought anger was a really strong theme in this book, with some of the characters (Morris, John Rothstein) acting rashly in anger and others thinking smarter because of it.   Rothstein gets his head blown off when he loses it with Morris (arguably this might have happened anyway but he didn't help himself by losing his temper). I think losing his temper was his way of commiting suicide in a way because he felt he had nothing to live for anymore.   Morris is imprisoned for years when he gets angry after fighting with his mum and kills his hero among others in a blind rage. Pete gets angry in Hallidays book shop but this makes him think more clearly when dealing with Halliday, encouraging him to research into his finances and preventing the notebooks getting into his hands. He also loses it with Morris and whaps him with the decanters allowing him to escape with his life.

I appreciated that more of this book was in past tense, but you're right--it made for an especially-jarring switchover when it happened.

Spike Lee, while discussing films with students at Washington State University and at Yale University, said he was dismayed at Hollywood's decision to continue using the premise; he noted that the films The Green Mile and The Legend of Bagger Vance used the ""super-duper magical Negro"".     Critics use the word ""negro"" because it is considered archaic, and usually offensive, in modern English. This underlines their message that a ""magical black character"" who goes around selflessly helping white people is a throwback to stereotypes such as the ""Sambo"" or ""Noble savage"".

stephenking,395l2g,GrabbinCowlicks,3,Tue Jun 9 12:28:33 2015 UTC,ebooks are the shit!  having a two hour commute kills even King's longest books like IT or the Stand in like 3 weeks!
stephenking,395l2g,Ryall132,2,Tue Jun 9 14:30:36 2015 UTC,"I love ebooks. I'm a security guard and when I worked nights, most of my shift was spent walking around an empty building on a patrol schedule. Lugging around 1000 page books with me to read on breaks got annoying. Ebooks are a much better alternative."
stephenking,3965ao,Parsteinerson,6,Tue Jun 9 15:12:29 2015 UTC,"Misery - super creepy, more on the suspense side than the supernatural, but really, really good."
stephenking,3965ao,helefica,2,Tue Jun 9 15:31:48 2015 UTC,"I second this. Misery is one of his best. I also want to mention Joyland, short and a great read, it doesn't get the attention it deserves."
stephenking,3965ao,PenguinOfBoom,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:45:39 2015 UTC,Is Misery the one with the writer getting trapped by a woman? I will have to check it out on my next trip to the bookstore. Thanks for the suggestion!
stephenking,3965ao,avsfan1933,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:26:18 2015 UTC,Yes it is.

stephenking,3965ao,UCMCoyote,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:06:08 2015 UTC,Is the Salem's Lot the book related to the Jerusalem's Lost city that King references  in Pet Semetary? I will have to check it out!
stephenking,3965ao,avsfan1933,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:29:44 2015 UTC,It's referenced in Dr. Sleep! =)
stephenking,3965ao,robkellismith,5,Wed Jun 10 20:48:22 2015 UTC,IT or The Stand. Kings two best books.
stephenking,3965ao,avsfan1933,3,Tue Jun 9 18:19:50 2015 UTC,"I love them all of course, but if I were you I would start on the Dark Tower series then read all the books related to it that you haven't already read. So jealous of you about to experience these other masterpieces for the first time."
stephenking,3965ao,robkellismith,2,Tue Jun 9 16:40:54 2015 UTC,"I have heard a lot about The Dark Tower series. There are graphic novels that go along with the books, correct? I am not sure what order to read that series in."
stephenking,3965ao,docwilson,2,Tue Jun 9 18:24:54 2015 UTC,"There are 7 main books in the Dark Tower series. Start with the Gunslinger and go from there. If you plan on reading the graphic novels, read them afterwards."
stephenking,3965ao,docwilson,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:57:21 2015 UTC,"Yup, I agree 100%. All the tie-in stuff can be read afterwards. (You'll prolly enjoy them more that way too, I did)"

stephenking,396boz,Low_Man_n_Yella_Coat,2,Tue Jun 9 18:47:12 2015 UTC,Are you equating the Low Men w/ the hat-wearing guys from '63?
stephenking,396boz,unkreativ,3,Tue Jun 9 20:50:29 2015 UTC,"IF our world, the key world, is changing in such a way, and as we all know it is the key-world, all that what is plotted to bring down the hated gunslinger may fail. So the Crimson King can not accept the risk of a changed timeline in keyworld."
stephenking,392tnc,big_red737,5,Mon Jun 8 21:11:19 2015 UTC,I really hope that they can distill this story down into something that does the book justice and I also really hope that this ends up being available someplace other than Hulu after it streams there first.
stephenking,392tnc,avsfan1933,5,Mon Jun 8 21:12:47 2015 UTC,This better not end up dragging on from years and shifting away from the book like Under The Dome.

stephenking,394pmt,Poshspices,10,Tue Jun 9 06:19:10 2015 UTC,In my opninion this is the best and most important book of the whole series.
stephenking,394pmt,unkreativ,2,Tue Jun 9 07:07:27 2015 UTC,Oh wow really? That's good to know just so I don't skip it
stephenking,394pmt,Canadamatt2230,2,Tue Jun 9 20:15:11 2015 UTC,"Don't skip it. The book is of incredible importance, but more importantly, its a much better book on your second trip through the series.   The big problem with WAG is that it interrupts this fast paced, killer awesome storyline that you have with Roland's current Ka-Tet. They have just survived their most harrowing challenge in their battle with Blaine and... whammo, right into the brick wall of the past. For the first few hundred pages, you're barely paying attention because you want to know what is happening back in Kansas. The ending should suck you in as it is probably his best climax to date, but if it doesnt, don't be discouraged.   When you finish the series, pick this book back up and re-read it. The entire story of Mejis is the best thing he has ever written, and when you can remove the impatience of wanting to get back to Kansas, most people are able to see that. Its a beautifully crafted love story western that takes my breath away with every reading."
stephenking,394pmt,Norville_Rogers_,5,Tue Jul 21 23:51:59 2015 UTC,"One of my favorites, the background is pertinent to the series, but it's a very well written story that's worth sitting through."
stephenking,394pmt,Bling_Clinton,5,Tue Jun 9 08:26:02 2015 UTC,"I think the only reason people would dislike this book is the fact the story doesn't progress at all through most of it, but its an important book in the series. Once you get passed that fact and accept it for what it is, the story really opens up. I think overall this book is full of foreshadowing and metaphors that help DT move along. Ka is a wheel after all and WAG kinda solidifies that."
stephenking,394pmt,jorash,3,Tue Jun 9 20:08:13 2015 UTC,WAG is incredibly important to understanding Roland as a character. I loved it personally but can understand that some might not like the style. Once you're finished I think you'll understand why it's so important however.
stephenking,394pmt,Low_Man_n_Yella_Coat,1 point,Tue Jun 9 08:47:06 2015 UTC,Aaah so it is important! That's good and yeah the series as a whole is still amazing
stephenking,394pmt,brandscaping,3,Tue Jun 9 20:14:47 2015 UTC,I've never been a fan of W&G.
stephenking,394pmt,kristianwriting,3,Tue Jun 9 20:52:08 2015 UTC,"Couldn't disagree more. Aside from book 1 for kicking off the series, this is the best of the bunch, IMHO. I've read WAG a few times, and am currently listening to the audio version again (excellent narration)  There's no reason to have more of a backstory for Eddie, Jake, and Susannah, as their gunslinger lives didn't start until they were pulled into mid-world. Roland, on the other hand (less a few fingers...) is of the line of Arthur Eld, and was born to hold the sandalwood grips.  While we learned of his besting Cort earlier, this novel is the story of him becoming the gunslinger he truly is, and I think is essential to the rest of the series. Thankee-sai."
stephenking,394pmt,DataSicEvolved,4,Wed Jun 10 01:30:14 2015 UTC,"Hated it. Skimmed it. Wolves of the Calla makes it all better, but you do still have to read W&G. It's important, unfortunately."

stephenking,38zt2t,Burngis12,6,Mon Jun 8 05:23:58 2015 UTC,"There's something really creepy about the first half of 1408 where the hotel manager is explaining what's wrong with the hotel room and it's history. The lead up is very susensful.   Also, the opening of IT where the bullies are being interrogated by the cops about the gay man they tossed into the canal. The victim's boyfriend and the bullies eventually mention a clown and how strange it was that there was a clown under the canal bridge. Then one of them say the clown dragged the man out of the water and he was still alive, then the clown bit into his arm pit like it was trying to eat his heart."
stephenking,38zt2t,KicksButtson,3,Mon Jun 8 07:27:34 2015 UTC,"I don't know why, but the story Dolan's Cadillac from Nightmares and Dreamscapes gave me, er, nightmares.  Not even sure why.  I was about 12 when I read it, but I'd read far scarier books before."
stephenking,38zt2t,SpookyGeek,2,Mon Jun 8 14:43:27 2015 UTC,"The Jaunt terrified me. Also that story about the grandma, but it's an adaption of a popular tale."
stephenking,38zt2t,davis98,2,Wed Jun 10 01:25:12 2015 UTC,"I've read so much King, and for me the absolute scariest, tensest scene was in Gerald's Game. Not even the infamous degloving one, but the entire saga of her trying to get the damn glass of water. And when she finally does, she can't even drink it 'cause of the cuffs. For some reason that book is almost too tense for me to handle--I have to take breaks when I'm reading it."
stephenking,38zt2t,thewindupbirds,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:17:32 2015 UTC,"I read a lot of horror, and its hard for me to get truly scared by a book. But there were two King books that gave me nightmares. Geralds Game, and 1408."

stephenking,38zt2t,grouchyfrostgiant,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:41:56 2015 UTC,I agree with you on It being the scariest. Was the 1st SK book I read & I was 12 years old. Slept with the lights on for a week after.
stephenking,38zt2t,robkellismith,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:44:59 2015 UTC,"Chalk this up to perfect timing, but Blaze (of all things!) scared the life out of when I read it because my oldest child was a baby. When the parents of the child Blaze kidnaps plead for the safe return and Blaze just leaves the kid alone for such long periods of time and the kid gets sick... GAH!  Also, 1408 tops the charts with Pet Semetary and The Jaunt."
stephenking,38zt2t,Omakepants,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:26:00 2015 UTC,"I think IT is his overall scariest novel for me. Any scene involving Stan stands out. The water tower, and Stan as an adult. And every time I sit on a toilet, I am reminded of when the toilet explodes, and I clench.  And the lady in the bathtub scene in The Shining made me freak the fuck out when I read that as a teenager. I couldn't stay in a bathroom without making sure the shower curtain was pulled back first. The same scene in the movie was pretty scary too."
stephenking,38zt2t,eggsaladbob,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:55:43 2015 UTC,"The Shining, in part because of the circumstances - I read it during a particularly rough winter, while getting over some serious personal setbacks, and living alone as the caretaker of a large, otherwise empty house.

You could hear a distinct difference between the men's and the women's voices, for instance, but they weren't ludicrous. Just an all-around great performance."
stephenking,38wfue,tattooedjenny,2,Sun Jun 7 22:37:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, a great number of readers charicature voices for the opposite sex, trying on a falsetto for female characters, and a lot of women readers seem to have a terrible time reading male characters, so that they all sound the same. I've specifically sought out other books Gardener has read, just because I know he'll do them justice (The Cider House Rules is another good one he reads.)"
stephenking,38wfue,argleblather,9,Mon Jun 8 00:27:32 2015 UTC,"John Slattery's narration of Duma Key was fantastic.   Edited to add that 11-22-63 was terrific in audiobook.  I haven't actually read an entire book in over a year, made a full switch to audiobooks and rip through about one per week.  IT read by Steven Webber was great, the entire DT series was great but Frank Muller was just the best."

The book is meh, but the audio, read mainly by Bruce Davidson with others as various characters, and that story comes alive.   I also loved Christine, Revival, Bag of Bones and It.   I liked the woman who read Rose in Rose Madder, but SK does the Norman part and I wasnt a huge fan. Also Cujo was read by an older woman, which felt...off."
stephenking,38wfue,agorby00,3,Sun Jun 7 12:57:49 2015 UTC,Surprised Bag of Bones isn't mentioned more. Its one of the more personal and engaging audio books. SK reads it and I listen to it at least once a year.

stephenking,38wfue,CygnusX1,5,Mon Jun 8 01:58:02 2015 UTC,Duma Key from John Slattery was my favorite so far.
stephenking,38wfue,longsnapper,3,Sun Jun 7 19:13:29 2015 UTC,"The best IMO read by the author: LT's Theory of Pets, Blood and Smoke (collection containing Lunch at the Gotham Cafe, 1408, and In the Death Room) and Hearts in Atlantis (athough parts of it are read by William Hurt, who also does an amazing job).  IT, as already mentioned, was fantastic.  Definitely do give that one a listen.  And even though it's not SK, I highly recommend Joe Hill's Heart Shaped Box.  I can't remember who read it, but it was masterfully done."
stephenking,38wfue,rachelhduncan,3,Sun Jun 7 15:13:20 2015 UTC,"It's already been said, but Steve Weber's reading of IT makes me wish he did more readings of King's books.

stephenking,38wfue,Hellspark08,2,Sun Jun 7 15:11:23 2015 UTC,Yes!  I love his short story audiobooks.  Nightmares and Dreamscapes had a whole host of celebrities to read them.  Tim Curry actually reads Crouch End and does a fantastic job.  And the actor who plays Fat Tony on the Simpsons (can't remember his name) reads Popsy.  I always liked that one too.

stephenking,38wfue,crashdemon,2,Sun Jun 7 17:23:41 2015 UTC,I have listened to alot of them and Frank Mueller is great but Weber's reading of It is fantastic although he doesnt have the voice changes that Mueller does he totally nails it.
stephenking,38wfue,concretecactus,2,Sun Jun 7 17:34:24 2015 UTC,Duma Key - John Slattery. I've listened to it many times.
stephenking,38wfue,argleblather,2,Sun Jun 7 19:25:55 2015 UTC,"I love Grover Gardener's reading of The Stand, there are a lot of accents to cover, many with subtle differences (Arkansas, Texas, Oklahoma, Bronx, New York, LA) and he does beautifully at communicating all of them. He also reads The Dark Half.   Sissy Spacek narrates Carrie perfectly. She's always been the face and the voice of Carrie for me, so I loved that.   Eli Wallach's old man voice for narrating Insomnia is perfect. His acting chops come through in a big way, I felt.   King's own narration can be a little hard for me to listen to, his voice does definitely have a nasal cast to it. I liked it more for Bag of Bones than for Needful Things.  I also quite liked Ron McLarty's reading of 'Salem's Lot, his voice tied to Ben Mears really clicked well for me."
stephenking,38wfue,Songofsusannah,2,Sun Jun 7 21:45:24 2015 UTC,I loved It and the Shining... really well read. The guy who reads It does the creepiest voice for Pennywise!

stephenking,38wfue,bmbs_away,2,Mon Jun 8 02:37:14 2015 UTC,11/22/63 was great.  I'm currently enjoying Duma Key.  Gunslinger was good.  Did not like Drawing of Three or Talisman.
stephenking,38wfue,ping33,2,Mon Jun 8 04:56:50 2015 UTC,"I set myself a personal project to listen to every King book and novella in 2012... I have 4 left (including the new one)  Aside from what has been mentioned (particularly IT and Duma Key)  I found that the books written in first person tend to work amazingly when well read:  Dolores Claiborne read by Frances Sternhagen (Ma Claven from Cheers) is maybe the best audiobook I have ever listened to, her performance is amazing!  Insomnia read by Eli Wallach - another good first person book well read by a good actor who inhabits the roll  The End of the Whole Mess - read my Mathew Broderick - nightmares and dreamscapes is broken down into several audiobooks and this reading is the best of the bunch   The Long Walk read by Kirby Heybone - totally underrated book read by someone I had never heard of. A hidden gem!"
stephenking,38wfue,jotaesethegeek,2,Mon Jun 8 08:01:31 2015 UTC,"In 2008/2009 (I can't remember which) I was able to acquire them all in digital form and started with Carrie and decided to read all of the fiction ones in order by publishing date.   I haven't fully updated the list (Haven't added which I own or all of the Movies/TV) but...I am now on Joyland, am well past what was released when I started and am close to the present.   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qNknzFY3DQH5L3VKe00014_6tIxh375cHMWC_GohPzA/edit?usp=sharing  As for favorite readers of course Frank Muller. I enjoy things read by Stephen King himself as well. Craig Wasson is good but him doing so many books in a row gets confusing because the base voice is the same.  Several others are excellent as well. Mare Winningham's Lisey's Story. John Slattery's Duma Key. Both fantastic. Raul Esparza's Under The Dome."
stephenking,38wfue,jpflathead,2,Tue Jun 9 13:30:13 2015 UTC,"Bag of Bones and Desperation are my favorites.  If you are ever traveling 395 anywhere near Reno late at night start listening to Desperation. Bring a change of underwear, maybe a diaper.  And Bag of Bones is amazing as a book and even better as a book read by Stephen King. Anytime King reads King, you're in for a treat, plus it will give you insight into how his other books are to be heard."

stephenking,38x8xl,Isai76,6,Sun Jun 7 16:54:29 2015 UTC,"the book focuses on the horrors of alcoholism and what prolonged solitude does to people,  the movie focuses more on the overlook being haunted.  It's Stephen King's least favorite adaptation."
stephenking,38x8xl,zeapups,6,Sun Jun 7 18:03:11 2015 UTC,"More importantly...  The book focuses on the main character being a loving father who desperately wants to make up for past mistakes and the ghosts of the Overlook attempt to corrupt him using his vices, and in the end he sacrifices himself to save his family and destroy the Overlook. The book is an analogy for King's life as a young husband and father at the time of its writing, it's a love letter to his family.  The movie focuses on the main character being an angry unloving father who hates his family and blames them for holding him back. The ghosts of the Overlook attempt to corrupt him and find it's actually quite easy to do because he's already crazy and already hates his family. In fact, you could say the ghosts are completely redundant and irrelevant because the Jack of the film would have gone nuts and tried to kill his family anyways, all he needed was extreme isolation and an excuse."
stephenking,38x8xl,KicksButtson,2,Sun Jun 7 19:06:12 2015 UTC,"The film deals with alcoholism and isolation, too, as well as familial resposobilites and impotency. I haven't read the book in a while, so I'm not going to comment on their differences, but The Shining focuses on way more than the Overlook being haunted. In fact, one of King's complaints is that Kubrick was really too pragmatic to accurately do something concerning the afterlife and that he lets the Overlook be swept into the background, though I find this to be a bit ridiculous.   I really don't see how you can look at The Shining without seeing how alcoholism is one of the biggest things that the movie deals with. The Overlook itself is alcohol, and it calls him, and he drinks, and it destroys his family. It's more complicated in that but if you went for the most oblique form of what is probably the biggest underlying metaphor in the film, it's that."
stephenking,38x8xl,HereEverafter,3,Sun Jun 7 19:14:56 2015 UTC,The movie is a solid piece of isolation horror.  The book will scare the shit out of you if you're reading it in the house alone on a winter's night while listening to Godspeed You Black Emperor.

stephenking,38x8xl,rayburno,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:11:41 2015 UTC,"Both are good, but minus one or two setpieces and a basic premise, they really don't have much in common.  As others have noted, Jack is a generally more sympathetic character in the book. He and Wendy (and their relationship) are characterized much more deeply. He also becomes obsessed with the history and backstory of the hotel, which is covered in much more depth in the book.  In terms of more minor differences, Jack wields a croquet mallet during his climactic rampage rather than an axe, and the hedge maze doesn't exist in the book (though there is a rather creepy sequence involving a collection of topiary animals)."

Honestly, as much as I liked Tim Curry in that role, I'd love to see someone else give it a shot.  I think there are a lot of actors who could do a decent job.

stephenking,38wxwk,Captain-Zebra-Tits,2,Sun Jun 7 16:17:25 2015 UTC,"I never saw We're the Millers so I can't comment on the kid's performance there but I feel like the IT filmmakers were kinda trying to pull a Heath Ledger, i.e. casting an unknown in an iconic role in hopes of duplicating that success.  With that said, he may still do a great job, who knows?  If he was good enough for Cary Fukunaga, he was probably pretty good.  Someone suggested William Dafoe and I thought that would be a great choice."

stephenking,38qbmk,JRSly,-1,Mon Jun 8 16:12:00 2015 UTC,"This seems pretty dumb. How exactly would it be structured? The first..I dunno, doesn't really matter..half? of the book is the miniseries and then you have to go to the theater to see the second half? It's supposedly being done this way to give more hours towards the story, so we shouldn't expect the miniseries to be fluff and unnecessary, right? And if you want to see the movie you'd have to also pay for Showtime as well or you'd be missing half the story. It makes no sense.  They're very limited with details on how it's supposed to work, but the only thing that would make sense to me is if the miniseries...and not an 8-part one, yeesh...was like a prequel of some sort or a companion and told a parallel story while parts of the book were happening in other parts of the country. Fun, but not vital to enjoying the theatrical movie. But like I said, this whole experiment is about giving a giant book as much time as possible, so wasting any time on new material would go against that."

stephenking,38qxrp,L3p3rJ0s1ah,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:00:16 2015 UTC,Even Rage?  That would be impressive as they halted production of it.
stephenking,38qxrp,Tia00017,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:37:31 2015 UTC,Yes even Rage.  It's pretty easy to find the Bachman books on ebay.

I won't give it away, but I was profoundly disturbed up till halfway through the book, when he ended the first section with one sentence and I closed the book and never picked it up again.  It's been.... what.... 4 years now?"
stephenking,38qk09,drasticsarcastic,2,Sat Jun 6 02:49:03 2015 UTC,You have to finish it it's one of his best....It almost wasn't published SK thought it was way too dark and personal as a couple things in that book actually happened to him (won't spoil) he finished it and put it in a desk drawer...he only published because he had one book left on his contract with Doubleday and he wanted to leave them over financial issues (non negotiable 50/50 cut of the paperback sales being a major sticking point) so he pulled it out of his drawer and gave it to them...I'm glad he did it's one of my favorites...you should give it another shot
stephenking,38qk09,TrashCanMan407,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:47:29 2015 UTC,I think it's great so far. But I'm not too far into it yet.
stephenking,38qk09,TrashCanMan407,3,Sat Jun 6 06:20:18 2015 UTC,Her slowly realizing Brian Andrew Joubert is in the corner standing there is one of the most terrifying things SK has ever written
stephenking,38qk09,docwilson,2,Sat Jun 6 21:42:50 2015 UTC,"I think it should have ended with the escape/car wreck. Then it would have been perfect.Still, a great read."

You're just shadows and moonlight!!"", thus confirming it was in fact him...freaking awesome haha"
stephenking,38qk09,docwilson,2,Sat Jun 6 21:51:26 2015 UTC,"That was interesting stuff, I agree, but the emotional climax was the escape. Everything that came after struck me as anticlimactic. I can't help but think if it had ended there you'd have put the book down and said to yourself ""wow, what a ride."""
stephenking,38qk09,RtimesThree,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:56:15 2015 UTC,"I had the same thought, and I think everything after that was too long, but I also feel like it was necessary to establish that it was totally a real person. Not her delirium or nightmares or going crazy from the hunger/thirst/fear, but like an actual, physical person that was literally in her room. That thought is what scares me the most when I think back to this book."
stephenking,38no9s,ZakMcKrakken,2,Fri Jun 5 11:44:14 2015 UTC,Jay McInerney's first book wasn't till 1984; The Stand originally published in 1978. So I doubt Harold's fiction relates to Jay McInerney.

stephenking,38nyid,graham_a_bama,3,Fri Jun 5 13:13:29 2015 UTC,"I finished It recently as well. Quite possibly my favorite King book of all time, and certainly one of his scariest. I don't get nightmares often, but Stan Uris in the Standpipe (sploosh sploosh) certainly gave me some. But the taking of Patrick Hockstetter is a pretty close second."
stephenking,38nyid,1015192122,2,Fri Jun 5 20:27:27 2015 UTC,Yeah the patrick hockstetter scenes need to be on film. So good.
stephenking,38nyid,stinkywizzleteets6,1 point,Sat Jun 6 07:16:18 2015 UTC,"That's why I hope that if the It reboot isn't dead in the water, they make it into two films. Even with the 3 hour length of the miniseries, they missed so many critical scenes."
stephenking,38nyid,condomofthesea,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:27:52 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say, for me anyway that it was all that scary. I mean it was definitely creepy but no nightmares were had. The two ""scariest"" scenes for me didn't even involve It. When Eddie Corcoran's step father beat him to death with a claw hammer and Eddie could only say ""daddy, I'm sorry. I love you"" and when Patrick Hockstetter murdered his bother; those both made me feel physically ill in my stomach."
stephenking,38nyid,1015192122,1 point,Sat Jun 6 13:13:35 2015 UTC,"As a father, I almost skipped the scene where Patrick smothered his baby brother. It was horrible. Actually, that whole section on Hockstetter was really fucked up. The animal abuse, the leeches flying out of the fridge... ack. I put the book down for a while."

stephenking,38mvpj,TrashCanMan407,6,Fri Jun 5 06:20:04 2015 UTC,"One thing I'm appreciating is that finally we get a villain who is not also a racist. Its just too easy and King has been doing it way too regularly.    While I'm on the subject, he really needs to find a black dude to run Jerome's dialogue by before publishing this shit. I love Stephen but goddamn has he ever actually talked to a real live black person?   But that's a minor complaint, I'm loving this novel."
stephenking,38mvpj,docwilson,3,Sat Jun 6 02:35:44 2015 UTC,"how about the obligatory Hannah Montana reference by teenage girls? So much dialogue is off and illogical in this one, it's a pity I'm forced to cringe every time someone opens their mouths as I really enjoy the story. Especially the Morris-part I think is classic King goodness! Bill Hodges' geriatric oneliner machinegunfire though... and i haven't even gotten to the Jerome part yet. I really really wish King had a better editor for these parts."
stephenking,38mvpj,hinnybee,2,Mon Jun 8 14:37:45 2015 UTC,"Hahahaha I'm laughing so hard right now...I made almost this exact same comment on another post about Finders keepers...my words were ""sometimes I think SK has never met a black person in his life""...every encounter with the Robinson family and especially Jerome is so very cringetastic...good call he really needs a black consultant to run this shit by haha"
stephenking,38mvpj,RTFW,2,Sat Jun 6 06:37:07 2015 UTC,"I read it in two days, but did not feel it was amazing.   I like Mr Mercedes way more than this one.    To me, Hodges bumbled his way into everything and was almost just a deus ex machina for the kid to get out of his mess."
stephenking,38mvpj,RTFW,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:48:13 2015 UTC,"That's funny you say that because that is pretty much the exact reason why I was disappointed in Mr. M and liked Finders Keepers better...Mr. M just felt like deus ex after deus ex and Hodges just pretty much stumbled into everything...Finder's Keepers had a much better storyline...and all the stuff about collectors and fans, he's basically telling us ""Yeah I understand how you guys feel about me."" I feel like Hodges could have not even been in the book and it still would have been great...what did you think about the very end with Brady? Considering the title of the next book Suicide Prince?"
stephenking,38mvpj,TheMightyFloorp,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:16:49 2015 UTC,I think the hospital parts in particular kept me looking forward to the next book and felt more King-like.  I kept hoping it would at least play out some more in this book.  And I do think Finder's Keepers had a better story with just the kid.  I guess it being a Hodges book made me expect him to play more into the story.  Any other book King would have had the kid's dad save him or something.  EDIT:  One thing I have to mention is that my first reading of King books is often more critical than my second reading.  Not really sure why either.
stephenking,38mvpj,Hello_Cup,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:25:46 2015 UTC,I was surprised myself when I hit page 200 and Hodges still hadn't shown up...and haha totally or his sister would have found a weapon or something

stephenking,38mvpj,docwilson,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:53:39 2015 UTC,"You're not wrong. I've just finished and it seems like that group of people simply followed along. Barbara tells them what the problem is, they think about it for a while, Tina tells them who to go to, that guy then tells them who else to go to, and from there they're just playing catch-up with the other characters. At no point do they really take any kind of initiative or figure anything out. They're really just there to help at the end. Honestly it feels a little like they don't belong in the story. It could've played out identically if you removed them, requiring only a minor tweak right at the end of the climax."
stephenking,38mvpj,SpookyGeek,2,Wed Jun 10 03:34:03 2015 UTC,"Just finished the audiobook, that ending! Get fucking hyped!   I hope we get the third before next year."

stephenking,38myts,goodbyeversailles,2,Fri Jun 5 06:54:50 2015 UTC,"This was the first SK novel I read when I was 8 years old and I was completely hooked since then...24 years later I've read every word SK has written...let's start with the sheer awesomeness of the book and leave the symbolism aside for a minute...that book puts you right there in the bed with Paul...every terrifying thing that happens to him feels like it's happening to you...the scene when he's locked in the basement, imagining the dead trooper coming after him still haunts me on certain dark nights after almost 25 years....my heart pounded out of my chest as he read the scrapbook...screaming at him to hurry up!!! She could be back any minute!!!....I thought the movie was one of the best adaptations of an SK novel and certainly hands down the best casting of a character ever with Kathy Bates as Annie...she won an Oscar for it actually...which brings us to Annie...you felt sorry for her because SK is freaking awesome...he'll give you the feels about the worst of the worst... you felt sorry for her because she was a true sociopath..she was completely devoid of any real empathy whatsoever...she killed anyone that got in her way...look at the scrapbook again and say you feel sorry for her haha...as for the symbolism with the cocaine addiction I feel like it was there but not 100% what he was going for...I've heard that he's said Annie was an imalgum of all the crazy letters he's gotten over the years...so there's one brain picked for you haha...I'll leave you with my favorite part...when the cops go into Paul's room at the end and Annie isn't there...where do they find her? Out in the barn dead.....with her hand wrapped around the handle of the chainsaw...."
stephenking,38myts,TrashCanMan407,2,Fri Jun 5 07:37:55 2015 UTC,"I'm just starting to get into SK, I'm boarding the train super late, but I'm working through his works really quickly, I just can't get enough.  The way the story told is absolutely riveting. I could feel every emotion Paul was feeling, and just how desperate he was. During the chapter where he found the scrapbook, I just couldn't read it fast enough. I was really curious about Annie's past, and it was quite clever how King modeled her crimes after an actual crazy ass nurse.   The movie is really impressive, and I agree that it really is one of the best adaptions I've ever seen. Kathy Bates was so incredible as Annie, it was like she was born to play it. I really can't get over just how perfect she nailed it, with her looks, her expressions, her tone of voice, mannerisms... It was incredible. Kathy Bates is a great actress, and when I was reading the book (I saw the movie first), I imagined her perfectly.  I can't argue with you on how talented SK is. I'm so conflicted about the sympathy I feel for Annie at certain points. She was just nuts, terrifying, unpredictable, and had no regard for any kind of life. She was scary. When she would go through her depressive episodes, I don't know why, but it weirdly made me feel bad for her, even though I knew how crazy and heartless she was. It was strange reading it, and finding myself feeling bad for her, when I really shouldn't have. Maybe it was because it was so evident that she had severe mental issues, or that she was capable of feeling that kind of emotion. I'm not sure, but it's weird.  I did read that Annie was a manifestation of the absolute crazies that wrote him, which makes her feel all the more real. I could see the cocaine addiction metaphor, and I could see how Annie symbolized the drug. Some days, she would be very bubbly, sweet, and happy - the way cocaine makes us feel sometimes. Other days, she was in a deep depression and full of anger, hatred, and overall darkness - something like a bad trip. She was also very volatile, which would make sense, as some things can set off the drugs, and suddenly everything is awful, when just a moment ago, it was like heaven. I can definitely see the symbolism near the end, where they're fighting. Paul was injured, struggling, giving it all of his strength, and Annie was, too. The struggle was close, desperate, and violent. With this, I can see the godawful strength it took to get clean, to release himself from the grips of the drug, but the drug was clawing at him to come back with all its power, too. And then when he finally closes the door, he's terrified, thinking she was dead, but maybe she wasn't. He was so scared that somehow, she wouldn't be dead, and then she would come after him, and that'd be the end of it. When the cops came, and told him that no one was in the room, the uncertainty, the fear (what if I relapse, what if it's not over?) was real and true. Then, when he's opening his door to his apartment, he sees Annie there waiting for him with an Axe, killing him. This is that constant fear of a relapse, that it would never go away, it would find him, and it would win. But then, it's revealed that she had made it to the barn, her last efforts grasped around that chainsaw meant for Paul. She was never going to stop, she died trying - much like the struggle of drug addiction and the hold it has on someone.  Edit: Also, the way Paul hated Annie and was terrified of her was clear, but his dependency on her was just as strong. He hated her, he wanted to kill her, he was terrified of her, but he knew he needed her to survive. IT'S JUST SO GOOD."
stephenking,38myts,TrashCanMan407,2,Fri Jun 5 08:57:13 2015 UTC,I didn't think about him seeing Annie at the end with the axe when she's not there represents the constant fear of relapse good call on that. Even after almost 25 years I'm finding new things haha
stephenking,38myts,1015192122,2,Fri Jun 5 16:05:52 2015 UTC,"I think the way Paul hated and feared Annie, yet relied on her, was the most riveting part of the book. A very complex, confusing, and interesting relationship."

It was a weird jumping-on point because like the OP alluded to, it is the first of what I call the ""raging cokehead trilogy"" of Misery, The Tommyknockers and The Dark Half.  You can see signs of how fucked up he was in all three books, but only Misery holds up as a really well-written novel.  It's tense all throughout and well-written with great pacing, the characters are relatable and not one-dimensional, and it's not overlong and tedious.  The other two books written in that coke stupor are disasters."

I was expecting what I saw in the movie, but NOPE, IT WAS A LOT WORSE. My ankle hurt after that scene, and I had to put the book down for a little while because omfg...  Don't be afraid to watch the movie, though! They purposely cut the gore down a whole lot, so you'll be okay! Definitely try and check it out, it's really good. Kathy Bates IS Annie."

Now reading Sharpe's Tiger by Bernard Cornwall, completely different from Kings work as the Sharpe books are concentrated on the British conquest of India around the 1800's.

stephenking,38j9xk,dragonsky,3,Thu Jun 4 16:26:19 2015 UTC,I really get into most Stephen King books and these were no different. I guess I should have mentioned that I finished the first three in a little over a week. Once I moved life kind of got in the way and my hobbies and interests changed a bit and I just didn't commit myself to find time to read them. I really love the feeling I get when reading a great book though and this series just happens several of them so I am really excited to get started just to see how it all plays out. I noticed when reading through the first couple that many of his other books referenced characters and other things out of the dark tower series so I am also interested to see if there are other tie ins in the latter books.

stephenking,38fr7r,nboylie,4,Thu Jun 4 00:45:56 2015 UTC,It wasn't a queation. The post was a video.  The video compares and contrasts the difrences.  I can see how my wording in the title could make it seem like I was wondering the differences.
stephenking,38fr7r,HoraceDerwent,3,Thu Jun 4 01:21:31 2015 UTC,"Expected butthurt King fanboys to belittle the movie in this thread. Leaving satisfied.  The movie is one of the best horror films ever made, and is regarded as one of the best movies of all time. The camera work, soundtrack, directing and acting by Nicholson are all top drawer. It's very different from the book because the director intended it to be that way. Unfortunately King didn't like it, so all his fangirls need to discredit it at any given opportunity."
stephenking,38fr7r,KicksButtson,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:04:59 2015 UTC,"It was a great movie, but I would have liked it to be faithful to the source material a bit more.   The thing that get's me the most is how they made Jonathan/Jack into a villian.   Don't get me wrong, he was psycho, but in the movie he was the bad guy the whole way through, while in the book he snaps out of it in the last minute and tells his son that he loves him.  That was the biggest difference that bothers me.  But apart form how Stan strayed from the source material, the movie was excellent."
stephenking,38fr7r,djoplin971,4,Thu Jun 4 20:10:46 2015 UTC,The book is competently written and served to better the career of a writer who was otherwise under-appreciated at the time.  The film is incompetently made and serves only to boost the ego of a director whose name alone acts to prop up an otherwise over-appreciated film.

But then, fantasy type books have never really interested me (although for some reason I ate up Kim Harrison). I'm mid 30s now and while I have gained no patience I may be able to actually read them.

As many others have said, it's completely subjective: Cell isn't anywhere near my favourite, but I don't hate it as much as some people. You seem quite set on making a skip list, which is fair enough, but perhaps change it to a maybe read later list instead.

You can show a couple after sex and it's fine.But if you say ""fuck"" 2 times, your movie gets different rating.  In Europe you can swear all you want, but if you show a boob your movie becomes controversial for nudity."

stephenking,385e6f,jdinger29,2,Tue Jun 2 02:48:17 2015 UTC,I'm currently reading Mr. Mercedes for the first time and absolutely loving it; I'll likely grab a copy of Finders Keepers as soon as I finish.
stephenking,385e6f,jedispyder,2,Tue Jun 2 04:25:25 2015 UTC,It's at times like this I really appreciate having a Kindle :)
stephenking,385e6f,shanemitchell,2,Tue Jun 2 11:39:21 2015 UTC,"As much as I love King, I need a Scifi/horror/supernatural aspect. Even if we later find in the book that the Scifi/horror/supernatural aspect turns out to be just people doing something that was mistaken for Scifi/horror/supernatural that's fine. Fantasy is ok and Historical tie-ins are also good if possible. I like Clive Cussler very much but not James Patterson/Robert Ludlum... Straight mystery just doesn't excite me very much. Mr Mercedes was extremely well written as you would expect but I kept waiting for something weird and it never came."
stephenking,385e6f,Damien__,2,Tue Jun 2 13:28:21 2015 UTC,Honestly you can probably go to a bookstore and get it today.
stephenking,385e6f,chillbill69,5,Mon Jun 1 23:59:45 2015 UTC,"Noo. I work at a bookstore and we are--as I assume all bookstores are--under strict orders not to sell it until tomorrow. Especially with someone prolific like King, no store is going to risk that."
stephenking,385e6f,gunslinger__,3,Tue Jun 2 01:26:47 2015 UTC,There are huge fines associated with breaking street date.  Also the fact the publisher may never let you sell their product again.  Good luck being a book store who can't sell King.
stephenking,385e6f,DeepRoast,2,Tue Jun 2 03:43:26 2015 UTC,"Huh? Do you mean the bookstore I work at?  Sorry, I must have written that confusingly: I meant the opposite. There is no way we can sell it until tomorrow because of said fines, etc.  Unless you were just speaking generally. In which case--yes, exactly!"
stephenking,385e6f,gunslinger__,3,Tue Jun 2 04:38:30 2015 UTC,"I believe that /u/DeepRoast is saying that if a store was caught selling a book before it's release date, that store would not only be fined, but also would no longer be allowed to sell those books, and it would be hard to be a successful bookseller if you are unable to sell Stephen King books."

stephenking,384mcx,SexualCasino,2,Mon Jun 1 20:38:28 2015 UTC,I'm not sure he'd be a great choice but I don't think that Lars Von Trier would shy away from putting anything and everything to film and I also think he's got a pretty good sense of setting up his shots and knowing when do to what with his camera.

stephenking,382jcj,jambawilly,14,Mon Jun 1 11:44:19 2015 UTC,the people on base were directly exposed to the virus & the gates were locked down so they all died on the job. the virus had not mutated at this point so iirc they died rapidly.
stephenking,382jcj,sapphireluna,6,Mon Jun 1 12:45:36 2015 UTC,"I figured that the contained, concentrated dose of Captain Trips (rather than the airborne whiff that Campion got) was enough to kill them swiftly, before immune-system responses could even start and cause noticeable symptoms (other than death; death is pretty noticeable as symptoms go)."
stephenking,382jcj,city17_dweller,5,Mon Jun 1 13:41:12 2015 UTC,My guess would be drowned in their own phlegm. Seems like I remember it only took an hour or so to kill them all. Contained and undiluted/unmutated that virus was way too good at what it did
stephenking,382jcj,Damien__,1 point,Mon Jun 1 13:24:08 2015 UTC,Thank you!
stephenking,382jcj,extra_magic_tacos,2,Mon Jun 1 13:59:02 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I don't think there's any medically plausible explanation for how fast the guys on the base died compared to everyone else in the book. It was, like, a mutation.     The Stand is my favorite book.  I'm prepared to accept a certain amount of hand waving."
stephenking,382jcj,Tia00017,2,Mon Jun 1 21:43:07 2015 UTC,"That gets touched on in the book. Remember when King mentions the security tapes, and how people were dying in the cafeteria (remember the guy who had his head in the soup)  We can then make the educated guess that everyone was locked in the base and died.  The virus was not mutated yet, so they would have died fairly fast (yet again soup guy)"
stephenking,382jcj,TrashCanMan407,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:04:36 2015 UTC,Just imagine the entire course of the virus all the stages from contraction to death happening in anywhere from 30 seconds to 5 minutes
stephenking,380m66,eggflipper,6,Sun May 31 23:45:15 2015 UTC,"m-o-o-n spells Bill Fagerbakke - he did an amazing job as Tom Cullen, and Gary Sinise was an excellent Stu Redman.   Rob Lowe as Nick was good - perhaps the first big good thing he did after his sex tape debacle?  Corin Nemec didn't do it for me - aside from his crazy bit once they got to Boulder, when Harold had become Hawk.   Other than Miguel Ferrer and maybe Matt Frewer, the rest of the casting wasn't overly memorable for me."
stephenking,380m66,brandscaping,4,Mon Jun 1 02:29:45 2015 UTC,Yeah molly ringwald didn't really sell it for me either.  E: Jamey Sheridan and Matt Frewer killed it imo
stephenking,380m66,sapphireluna,3,Mon Jun 1 03:04:40 2015 UTC,"tom cullen is one of my favorite characters in all of SK's stories & bill fagerbakke nailed it. rob lowe was excellent playing nick & playing off bill. they worked well together.  the casting of stu, larry & glenn was spot on, too, imho  to this day jamey sheridan creeps me out no matter what role he's in & i never hear BOC without imagining crows."
stephenking,380m66,steviehendrix,9,Mon Jun 1 12:54:05 2015 UTC,"what about the woman who played nadine, she was pretty mammarable."
stephenking,380m66,antisocialoctopus,5,Mon Jun 1 05:03:59 2015 UTC,I just wasn't a fan of the miniseries. I did like some of the character casting. I'd agree pretty much exactly with /u/brandscaping but overall it just didn't work for me. I felt like a good bit of it felt forced and hokey.
stephenking,380m66,frostfromfire,2,Mon Jun 1 02:45:40 2015 UTC,Yes! And the missing scenes.
stephenking,380m66,city17_dweller,4,Mon Jun 1 03:07:19 2015 UTC,Gary Sinise was good in his role but I thought the casting for the rest of the miniseries was pretty lackluster.  I kind of hate the miniseries because none of the actors really match up with what I'd expect of the personalities of the characters.
stephenking,380m66,Hugh_Jampton,4,Mon Jun 1 03:26:23 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, neither Harold nor Frannie were particularly well cast, which made that really interesting and angsty pairing fall completely flat, and made a lot of Stu's scenes with Frannie a bit preposterous (Sinise was brilliant casting, though).  I thought most everyone else was terrific, however.  Rob Lowe was a good choice because of Nick's friendship with Tom Cullen; Lowe has a nice, gentle charisma."
stephenking,380m66,Sylar_Lives,3,Mon Jun 1 09:37:39 2015 UTC,Glen Bateman and Mother Abigail were excellently cast IMO  I'm listening to the audiobook at the moment and I can't see them any other way
stephenking,380m66,Justamum,3,Mon Jun 1 10:41:55 2015 UTC,I would say the only casting I liked in this miniseries was Matt Frewer.
stephenking,380m66,Plodkron,3,Mon Jun 1 03:05:38 2015 UTC,Bombed it
stephenking,380m66,Damien__,2,Mon Jun 1 03:14:53 2015 UTC,"I agree OP, I believe the cast was fantastic and I have trouble imaging other people in these roles. A lot of the characters were unable to reach their full potential, due to not fitting the entire story into the mini series."
stephenking,380m66,deviger,2,Mon Jun 1 05:57:08 2015 UTC,"I really wanted to like the miniseries, but I found it to be lacking in pretty much every department. It starts well, but drags horribly in the middle and falls flat on its face by the end. The pacing was terrible. And whoever wrote the script did a woeful job. 95% of the dialogue is stiff & cheesy, it takes some very good actors to eke something out of them, and sadly there aren't many of those on show here.  It's upsetting because I felt like they could and should have done a much better job. A better writer and a grittier tone throughout would have gone a long way. Most of the characters were turned into non-entities, Fran was turned into a whiny joke and Mother Abigail, wow, one of the blandest characters committed to film ever. I found every one of her scenes excruciating boring, particularly if she was on her own talking to God. I felt my soul weeping from boredom. I enjoyed her parts in the book, but it really didn't translate.  I agree with the general consensus though that Stu was well cast, as was Tom Cullen, Lloyd Henreid, Trashcan Man & Randall Flagg. I thought the woman cast as Dayna Jurgens did a great job and there should have been more of her. She was a lot better than Molly Ringwald anyway.  As I said, I really wanted to like this, but for me it's only a tier above The Langoliers. I bet SK loved it as well."
stephenking,380m66,kranix1,2,Mon Jun 1 12:36:36 2015 UTC,"I thought Ossie Davis was great as Judge Farris and if I remember he was a last minute replacement for a different actor who had to pull out (got sick maybe)  Molly Ringwald did better than I expected but still wasn't Frannie for me. The same with Laura San Giacomo as Nadine  Cory Nemic was terribly one dimensional until he embraced his bad side  Rob Lowe I was skeptical about and proud to say I was wrong as he did a fine job!  Gary Sinise (Stu), Jamey Sheridan (Flagg), Ruby Dee (Mother A), Miguel Ferrer (Lloyd), Matt Frewer (Trash), Adam Storke (Larry),  Peter Van Norden (Ralph), Bridgit Ryan (Lucy), Kellie Overbey (Dayna), Ed Harris (Starkey) all did an amazing job and I thought were great choices.  For me though the two standout, absolutely perfect casting choices were   Bill Fagerbakke as Tom Cullen. He totally WAS that character. I don't remember having to make any changes at all to accept him as Tom.  Ray Walston as Glen Bateman was GREAT! Always a pleasure to see him. His last role before dying was a Star Trek Voyager episode."
stephenking,380m66,kranix1,2,Mon Jun 1 14:04:45 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed it the first time I saw it, which was around when it came out. I was 13 at the time. SyFy ran it a few years back and I rewatched most of it. Some of it doesn't hold up. Molly Ringwald seemed to be phoning it in a bit and I thought Flagg could have been better. Otherwise, it is still decent. That literal Hand of God nearly ruins it still though."
stephenking,380m66,JuanEstevez90,2,Mon Jun 1 14:20:23 2015 UTC,"Gonna try and stick with the main people. I have thoughts about lots of the minor characters as well though.  Ones they nailed:  Flagg  Stu Redman  Judge Farris  Starkey  Dayna Jurgens  Nadine Cross - with reservations since they tried to meld two characters who weren't really alike. Got the look right, messed up the character(s) with the writing  Ralph Brentner - I swear to God he is exactly how I imagined the dude when I first read the book.  Julie Lawry  Ones they failed:  Nick Andros - this is definitely the worst casting in the whole thing. I love Rob Lowe but he was so wrong for this part it is sick. He was too frickin' old, even then. He looks like Stuart from that sketch on Madtv, his makeup is so bad. They even dress him in clothes that are too big to make him look younger but it doesn't work. Barf  Frannie Goldsmith - Too old for the part. Not the right vibe for Frannie. in the miniseries she's like Skyler White in Breaking Bad except Skyler White has a spine and is likeable. Part of the problem is probably the direction/writing.  Harold Lauder - Harold is a solid 250 when the book starts out. That wouldn't normally be important except his weight loss and transformation from insecure, fat, pimply 16 year old to sveldt terrorist mastermind with the nickname of Hawk is an important part of his arc.  Kojak - Wrong breed.  Ones who weren't perfectly cast but the actors made it work:  Lloyd Henreid  Mother Abigail - they're not gonna find a 108 y/o woman to play this part, I get it  Glen Bateman   Larry Underwood - Mixed feelings. It's like they wanted John Stamos and got the next closest thing. More or less works for the character. They sort of castrated the character though by cutting Rita Blakemoor from the story and not letting us see what happens in California with him before the Superflu hits.  Trashcan Man - guy performs wonderfully, is just older than what I pictured Trashy as. You could file this under nailed it, really."

My Aunt was a member of the Stephen King Book Club and had every one of his novels in her bookcase. She saw me looking at them and said I could borrow any one of them to read, and I chose The Tommyknockers, mainly due to the cover and the strange name.  I loved it. I'd never read anything like it before and I couldn't wait to see what other stories this author had to tell. Sadly, my aunt passed away very suddenly not long after letting me borrow this book and I haven't re-read it since.  While it may not be regarded as one of his better books by most fans, and even King himself, it always holds a place in my heart as being my gateway to all of Stephen King's other works, thanks to my dearly missed Aunt."

I really disliked this book.  I felt like the first 3/4 of the story consists of nothing but character development and filler. Now don't get me wrong, character development is important. It's one of the best ways to make the reader care about the main character. If we see them grow and change we become invested in them.   But typically the significant character development that makes the reader become attached to the main character occurs during the regular story arch. What I mean is, we get to experience the protagonist's character development while he deals with the main plot, the challenges he faces, and the enemies he squares off with.   By all accounts this story was marketed as King's most frightening story ever with a definite Lovecraftian cosmic horror vibe. Yet more than the first 3/4 of the story have nothing to do with anything horror, so what's the plot here? Is this a horror novel, or is this just a character study? It felt like the first 3/4 of the story was a Forest Gump type story where we just watch this guy go from one life altering event to another, then it ends with a Lovecraftian manner straight out of left field.  After a couple of hours of reading about the main character's slow growth into a middle aged man we finally get to the horror portion of this horror novel, and then it ends. We literally read through this guy's whole life story from age 7 to age 50, and then it ends with the horror.  So for a horror novel this book is lacking in horror content, and the Lovecraftian connection is very mild."

Heroux was promptly pursued by a mob of townsfolk and hanged. It returned to hibernation when the Kitchener Ironworks exploded, killing 108 people, 88 of whom were children engaged in an Easter egg hunt.  1929 – 1930: It awoke when a large group of Derry citizens gunned down a small group of gangsters known as the Bradley Gang. It returned to hibernation when the Maine Legion of White Decency, a Northern counterpart to the Ku Klux Klan, burned down an African-American army nightclub known as ""The Black Spot.""  1957 – 1958: It awoke when Dorsey Corcoran was beaten to death by his stepfather, Richard Macklin; Its first known victim at this time was Georgie during one of the floods that hits Derry every few years. It then met its match when the Losers' Club forced It to return to an early hibernation when wounded by the young Bill Denbrough (Georgie's older brother) in the first Ritual of Chüd.  1984 – 1985:  It awoke when three young homophobic bullies beat up a young gay couple, Adrian Mellon and Don Hagarty, throwing Mellon off a bridge (echoing real life events in Maine). It was finally defeated in the second Ritual of Chüd by the adult Bill, Richie, Beverly, Eddie, and Ben, though this triggered the collapse of the water tower and flooding of the town."

stephenking,37sw3v,no_capes,15,Sat May 30 03:05:09 2015 UTC,"I cringe a little every time I hear King criticize The Shining for being mysoginistic or being poorly executed. Yes, it's very different from the book, and yes it's very tonally cold, but different is not bad. I honestly don't think King would have any problem with the movie had it been an original piece and not something based off of his own work.  If he was familiar with Kubrick's work, he should have known that when Kubrick adapted a book, he did what he felt was right with his own story and he own agenda. The Shining was not a poorly made film. As with Kubrick's other films from Paths of Glory to Eyes Wide Shut, you can say what you want about the story, to each his own, but when it comes to the angles used and the technical aspects, it's bordering on ridiculous to call any of it downright horrible. Even Kubrick's detractors will admit to a certain level of technical brilliance in his films, even if they dislike the stories and characters themselves.   Jack was not insane from the get go, but he wasn't a great man either, but he was trying to shape up. Though sometimes people fail, and, with the help of the overlook, he failed. Is this different from the book? Yes. Is this inherently bad? No.   Wendy is deferent from the book, yes. Yes, she screams a lot. But is she incompetent? No. This idea that a female character has to be Ellen Ripley to not be a misogynistic portrayal is not only ridiculous but offensive. Had it not been for a possessed hotel, Wendy would have been fine. She hit Jack over the head, she locked him in a store room. That was smart, it was efficient, and she would have gotten away with it, too, had it not been for those pesky ghosts. In the end, she wins. Yes, she screams a lot, but the person who is supposed to have her back in all situations, to be supportive and loving, has suddenly decided to axe murder her and her son. She is allowed to be hysterical. I understand not liking how different it is, but attacking the film as misogynistic and poorly shot is kind of cheap.   As a pretty big Kubrick fan and a decently sized King fan, this has always been one of those things that has always bothered me so I've decided to spill out a couple of my opinions on it here. Sorry if it's a bit jumbled, I just sort of typed this off the cuff. Okay. I'm done now."
stephenking,37sw3v,HereEverafter,2,Sat May 30 03:37:22 2015 UTC,"I completely agree.

stephenking,37o04e,IDGAF1203,5,Fri May 29 11:56:43 2015 UTC,"King has said something about geography shifting as well as time, but I can't find the quote right now. It might have been in reference to some other part of the series, though.     (Pg 33) - Editing error: If Roland was walking north on the beach of the Western Sea, how can it be correct that he saw ""the sea to his right, the mountains to his left""? It would have to be the sea to his left and the mountains to his right.   http://www.darktowercompendium.com/nitpicker-dt2.html    Also read the ""From: Tom"" Q&A here"

stephenking,37n8o1,deepvoicematt,3,Thu May 28 22:04:41 2015 UTC,It's one of those series you'll be better just reading the thing and then read it again and then maybe start asking questions after reading it a third time.

stephenking,37n8o1,eggflipper,11,Sun May 31 23:53:55 2015 UTC,"To say that the Dark Tower series is the overarching work of King's career is accurate.  It is related to most of the books or short stories of King in one way or another, and if you are familiar enough with his entire body of work, you'll see the connections.    It is a world based on Arthurian legend, with guns instead of swords.  It has its own language and animals, but this world ""has moved on.""  Roland is the last of Arthur's line and he is trying to save his own world and many, many others.  The Dark Tower is a linchpin across many realities.  In the words of one character, ""there are other worlds than these.""  It weaves in and out of time and place, picking up characters to build a team, a family, called a 'ka-tet.'    I want you to read all of Kings work to understand all the lines between stories, but that's a crazy request.  Just understand how satisfying it is to see it when it happens.    If you have any specific questions, you are welcome to ask them.  Also, there are a couple books that have been written about the series that detail all the crossovers and you could seek one of those out."
stephenking,37n8o1,brentfield,9,Thu May 28 23:37:43 2015 UTC,"Keep reading. Just based on the questions you've asked, it's clear that really nothing has been spoiled.   I wish I could go back and read it again without knowing the story :)"

Also, it's not exactly ""fantasy"" as such, it's as much a spaghetti western as it is anything.  That said, it's what Sai King has said is the story he was born to write. I believe that says something."
stephenking,37n8o1,amanforallsaisons,3,Thu May 28 23:34:47 2015 UTC,"I read it without reading any of his work, and now I'm a huge fan of it all. It's well worth the investment, it's a series I still think about five years later. I remember the moment my friend said, ""Hey man, have you read this?"".   Randall Flagg is a somewhat mythic being. He has survived the events of the Stand (which is heavily, heavily referenced at one point), and is part of the reason Roland's world is post-apocalyptic.   This is conjecture: he is a breaker of worlds for an other-worldly purpose. The purpose IS revealed.  However, the reason there are references to Hey Jude and similar things is to show you early on that every world can 'bleed' into another. This has ramifications for our characters.   It is well, well worth the investment and if you're young I recommend reading it. If you liked Lord of the Rings, then you'll like this for it's themes and grandeur, much like Lord of the Rings. If LotR was set in the past, present, future in a cowboy western sci-fi urban thriller setting with time travel, it would look like the Dark Tower. LotR are the best books I've ever read, but the Dark Tower is my favourite."

That these things couldn't happen in cities like that?

stephenking,37jrdb,HereEverafter,3,Thu May 28 04:09:23 2015 UTC,"I know that Kubrick probably won't get lots of love on this subreddit for how he adapted the Shining, but he once said that if it could be thought of written, it could be filmed, and I think that if you edited it well enough (probably highly stylized to where you wouldn't get full shots of like, the werewolf chasing Richie and Bill or Ben's mummy, just glimpses) it could come close to the novel.   However, I do have quite a big problem with this whole change of scenery thing. Derry is as much a character as It or the Losers, and I'm not extremely confident that a New York setting with jibe with the story. Though they're also changing all of the characters and dates so really it seems to just be taking the basic concepts of the book and running with them.  So I think it could be done if enough thought and care was put into it, but I'm pretty unenthusiastic about this attempt."

All are brutal and unforgiving. Over two films with a combined runtime of maybe 6 hours tops, would these scenes further the plot? No.   Does King adding these nuggets make It the powerful book it is? Absolutely.   At the risk of sounding like a broken record, It needs to be on HBO as a single series run of 12 episodes (none of this dragging out over two or three seasons and wildly diverting from the source material)."

stephenking,37dmxc,Rev_Jim_lgnatowski,1 point,Wed May 27 20:40:28 2015 UTC,They probably stayed put and took care of their family. Denver and Vegas were for people looking for a place to belong; an immune family would already have that.
stephenking,37dmxc,ChronoTravis85,1 point,Wed May 27 02:44:25 2015 UTC,Good point actually ...
stephenking,37dmxc,shrewgoddess,1 point,Thu May 28 09:34:03 2015 UTC,"Lucy Swan was an immune, and didn't the book say her kids died from the flu? It is true that the way immunity is presented in the book doesn't make complete sense. I'd think that if the immunity was genetic and inherited, then there would be a lot more than 0.7% surviving, and there would be a lot of surviving siblings and stuff like that."
stephenking,37bdpp,CrimsonKing1029,33,Tue May 26 11:22:33 2015 UTC,I prefer it just die rather than be bastardized to make it marketable to teenagers.

stephenking,37bdpp,Rasalom,8,Tue May 26 20:01:14 2015 UTC,Stephen King himself on Facebook said the whole remake is dead now anyway.

stephenking,37bdpp,TheDudeWhoKnocks,6,Tue May 26 18:30:32 2015 UTC,You should be more annoyed by the rumors that the budget restrictions were put in place after the Poltergeist remake performed poorly. They got worried since it had a scary clown at the center of the marketing. It shows just how out of touch they are with the source material.
stephenking,37bdpp,JohnCarpenterLives,6,Tue May 26 17:27:44 2015 UTC,"I find it hard to be upset about something that hadn't actually happened. The movie was an idea, nothing more."
stephenking,37bdpp,HoraceDerwent,2,Tue May 26 16:25:58 2015 UTC,"I realise that ""making it for teenagers"" makes it sound like the source material would need to be drastically changed for the screen but saying the ensuing film would definitely suck because of it is a bit of a stretch.  As for Carey Fukunaga, I agree. He was a damn great choice and I'd love to see what he could've done with the material.  That said, it is possible that Mr. Fukunaga was simply asking for too much out of New Line. Unless we were able to know both sides of the story, we don't really know what went down.  Anyways, I'm sad like you. Unless they can find someone just as good to bring it to fruition, I'd just let it die."

stephenking,37bdpp,HughHoneyRealEstate,3,Wed May 27 02:06:58 2015 UTC,"Besides what HughHoneyRealEstate said, you can tell a lot about a director by looking at the style of his/her films. Just because Fukunaga hasn't directed horror per se, doesn't make him incapable of making a good horror movie. If you look at his work in both True Detective and his feature film Jane Eyre, they're very different but also very similar in style and tone.   That's what's very important about film directors: Making every movie you make different, but putting your own stamp on it. For example, every Martin Scorsese film is different, but you can tell it's a Scorsese film by the style, tone and the way Scorsese likes to tell his stories."
stephenking,37bdpp,clwestbr,3,Wed May 27 03:10:36 2015 UTC,"Did you see True Detective?  At its core it was a cop drama but it had heavy heavy horror influences and undertones.   Even despite that, being a very talented director can carry over across multiple genres"

Jesus H. Tapdancing Christ.  How about we stop with the fucking remakes of films that largely depend on the viewer not knowing the story in order to really appreciate the experience?  Poltergeist did not need to be remade, and nobody should be surprised that a limited number of people were willing to pay to see the same story with different special effects.   Frankly, I think IT falls into the same category.  ""A clown in the marketing material"" - yeah, that's your problem all right.  That and a shitload of overpaid clowns in suits."

stephenking,36zz6q,xilonian,6,Sat May 23 16:09:09 2015 UTC,I would recommend also getting...   The Stand It 11/22/63 Under the Dome Some of the Bachman Books 'Salem's Lot   and   the shining   If you're really looking to build a collection.
stephenking,36zz6q,Nichase,3,Sat May 23 16:34:50 2015 UTC,"Great list! For Bachman books I would specifically recommend ""The Long Walk"" and ""Thinner""."

stephenking,36zz6q,Nimbacinus,2,Sat May 23 19:19:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah definitely easier to get ""Rage"" as part of the Bachman Books collection versus the standalone (which are worth hundreds of dollars due to King letting the book fall put of print). I guess the newer editions of The Bachman Books don't have rage in them, so you would have to look for an older copy!"
stephenking,36zz6q,Gilarus,2,Sat May 23 20:24:03 2015 UTC,"I heard it went out of print after the Columbine shooting.. No idea if the newer editions have it or not. I got mine at a used bookstore. Old beat up paperback. It's fine for reading, but not really ""collection"" worthy."
stephenking,36zz6q,Nimbacinus,2,Sat May 23 20:51:22 2015 UTC,Old roommate was getting rid of all of these except wind through the keyhole. Picked them up for $15. Box set still had plastic.   Bought wind through the keyhole for a day 1 delivery from amazon back when it came out. Will definitely be looking at getting all the books you mentioned.

When they interview the victim's boyfriend he explains he too saw a clown under the bridge, and that the clown dragged his lover's body out of the water and then bit into his arm pit as though he was trying to eat his heart.  The police then argue about the mention of the clown because one of them says that such a reference from two independent witnesses is too big to ignore, but the other says that it's crazy and if they go after it then the actual criminals who threw the man off the bridge would go free due to reasonable doubt."

stephenking,36lx95,ilovecfb,3,Wed May 20 12:22:30 2015 UTC,"Like you, I really enjoyed Insomnia, and like you, I couldn't make it through Cujo. Honestly I love 90 percent of King's work but some stuff I'll readily admit I could barely make it through. I don't think taking a break would have helped, it's just some stuff wasn't up my alley. A lot of people loved Lisey's Story and King even said it was his favorite thing he ever wrote. I thought it was awful. It is what it is."
stephenking,36lx95,Deadman76,3,Wed May 20 14:48:53 2015 UTC,"I struggled for about 4yrs to read a Stephen King book. I have been a fan for nearly 30yrs but really found it difficult to read the newer books for some reason so left them on my shelf. Then Dr Sleep, Revival and Mr Mercedes arrived and its game on again!"
stephenking,36lx95,anitasanger,3,Wed May 20 15:28:46 2015 UTC,"I love reading everything, but nothing is like King. I agree with the coming home analogy. When I'm knee-deep in a King novel, I'm enraptured with comfort. In spite of the content, it's soft and cozy in-between those pages. I haven't read all of King's works and I dread the day that I've read them all. Just knowing there are undiscovered works out there makes me happy."

stephenking,36lx95,Kozemp,2,Sat May 23 06:18:24 2015 UTC,"All the time, at this point. I've read all the King I'm going to read (which is almost all of it anyway) so now I have nice interregnums between book releases.  My proverbial ""to read"" pile has more than a hundred books on it. Rereading books? Ain't nobody got time for that! (Except Cryptonomicon, which I read every year.)"
stephenking,36lx95,Onefortheisland,2,Wed May 20 14:02:13 2015 UTC,"I take breaks frequently. I find that I can get burned out pretty easily. I also just like reading a variety of different stuff -- in particular, different horror."
stephenking,36lx95,ezzendy,2,Wed May 20 15:11:47 2015 UTC,"I had a time when i was between 13 and 21 years of age that i almost only read books from Stephen King. I would guess about 80%. Now it dropped to maybe 10%, but i still enjoy his books. I don't think that it is a good idea to focus too much on one author."
stephenking,36lx95,Adam-O,2,Wed May 20 15:15:20 2015 UTC,"It's good to have other authors to cycle through when you get burnt out, especially when dealing with the long reads that SK writes. I tend to gravitate to Neil Gaiman and Neil Stephenson. I just took a break and read the His Dark Materials trilogy by Phillip Pullman (Golden Compass and such...). Great little break. I'll probably read Reamde by Neil Stephenson before I tackle some some more SK. I've done 2 tours through TDTower and a lot of the supplemental books that deal with that, so I'll probably fit in some other classics of his next (The Shining is next for me I think)."
stephenking,36lx95,Desparia,2,Wed May 20 19:39:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah I take breaks, but after the break I will pick up one of my many King books, get through it and want more. My last break  ended just after the new year (cause whats a new year with King? Hehehe) and I read Doloros Claiborne.. felt hooked so read another one, and another (The stand, then Drawing of the THree (TDT) ) and now i'm up to Wolves of the Calla.   I think maybe I have too much free time to read. Hehe."

Also, I take breaks to read me some Palahniuk, McCarthy, or Vonnegut, but after a couple of books I always go back to SK. So I actually stopped struggling and alternate reading 1 SK book and 1 non-SK book. Works out pretty nicely."
stephenking,36lx95,Desparia,2,Wed May 20 22:33:08 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Alternation is the key - the trouble is that TDT is a loooong story, so I won't be alternating for a while. Hehe"

Not sure if you've ever checked out his autobiography On Writing, which was a very good book, but there is a portion where he says something along the lines of ""There are too many books in the world that you will never get a chance to read to waste your time on a book you don't like."""

I guess the book kinda has two endings.. or just the one depending on how you look it at, or none at all.   For what it's worth, I say keep on reading. It's worth it. :)"

stephenking,36ldmc,TheMightyFloorp,2,Wed May 20 14:41:59 2015 UTC,"I started reading the series in 1995. I thought Wizard and Glass was great, if different.  So, I say this as someone who had to wait a bit for the series and had re-read the first four books several times: I was very disappointed with the way the series ended. There was a complete shift in the tone of the story for the last three books, making it feel almost like an entirely different world than the one we'd been used to.  I think that King used the final three books of the Dark Tower series as a coping mechanism for his accident, and I think that the series suffered for it. Especially looking at Song of Susannah, which I feel is one of King's weakest books - not just of the Dark Tower series, but that he has ever written.   I finished the seventh book within 48 hours of purchasing it in 2004, and was disappointed then. In 2013, I gave the entire series a re-read, thinking that my thoughts may have changed over time, since nearly 10 years had passed.   They hadn't.  There are others who rather enjoyed the way the series ended. You may be one of them. But if you're looking for honest opinions, mine is that King dropped the ball."

My dream was that Pennywise was lying outside my deck's glass door with his head propped on his hand, smiling at me and waving me to open the door for him.  He looked like the Tim Curry version so I was able to tell myself that this was not the ""real"" Pennywise.  He stood up and began to look angry.  Then he immediately changed form.  He remained a clown, but was essentially a zombie version, dressed in a gray clownsuit, and I knew he could now get into my house without my help.  That ended my sleep for the night."

stephenking,36hun3,OnusDefacto,2,Tue May 19 17:08:47 2015 UTC,"I think that the crew in IT say they werent sure if they got all of his eggs, which may be a way for him to ""respawn"".  Also the Alien from dreamcatcher refers to himself as Bob Gray, just like IT, so I could guess that if he did respawn and ""Pennywise lives"" is true, he may not be as powerful after a defeat like that and come back in the form of a mind controll peppering of Orange fungus."
stephenking,36hun3,TheundeadUnicorn,0,Tue May 19 22:35:34 2015 UTC,What do you mean confirmed?  I mean that comment was just a passing thought but I'm curious what you mean.
stephenking,36hun3,6isNotANumber,0,Sat Jun 20 03:03:03 2015 UTC,"Well for one thing Pennywise/It was not a Ripley Alien... and that's what Mister Gray's race is. It's all there in Dream catcher, and of course in It. They are no where near the same."
stephenking,36hun3,TheundeadUnicorn,0,Sat Jun 20 03:16:53 2015 UTC,"But It has had mass-mind control powers along with suggestion and the ability to effect an entire town to believing what ""It"" wants.  I was saying if one of the eggs hatched, and it wasn't as powerful as the full fledged adult being that ruled Derry in ""It"" it could still have grown to a point of trying to use a different tactic to infiltrate an area.  Sure ""It"" acts different than this other race of Alien beings, but all in all the powers It shows aren't necessarily all the powers It has, and the fact that they both identify as Something ""Gray"", and Pennywise lives shows up in the book, I'm saying they aren't necessarily totally unrelated.  It doesn't absolutely have legs under it, but the theory still holds a possibility.  When you say confirmed, that means there is legitimate proof in the book or through word of god (King) that they are different, when what I think you mean is you don't like that idea/that's not how you see it.  Pennywise wasn't a werewolf either, but It assumes that form at a time.  Also, It tends to take the form of it's prey's fears and what was Kertz (I think the Generals name) afraid of more than anything?"

When he was done stomping them he told the others that he thought he got em all. So its safe to assume he missed a few.

The Turtle is the most obvious connection, but then it's more explicit in the final Dark Tower book, where the group meets Dandelo which is the same type of being as Pennywise.  Also, the kids all forget about Pennywise at the end of the book, which is something that usually happens in books related to the Tower."

stephenking,36cepr,Damien__,5,Tue May 19 13:02:17 2015 UTC,If someone cares enough to ask about reading order maybe it's because they know that the details revealed by reading books in a certain order WILL make  a difference to them. We should care enough to realize that. We should not have the arrogance to tell someone else what does and does not make a difference to them. Maybe we should care enough to put a little thought into an answer rather than just telling them 'read the damn books already'  Do you need to read Salems Lot before the DT? No but if you care enough to come here and ask you will probably be glad you did read it first. Maybe you would even be glad someone was kind enough to tell you that.
stephenking,36cepr,littlered2,5,Mon May 18 13:53:09 2015 UTC,Well thank God someone said it!!! Just read the damn books! And it doesn't have to be in order! I read the wizard and the glass and then found out there was such thing as the DT

stephenking,36cepr,darth_handturkey,1 point,Mon May 18 19:52:19 2015 UTC,"Yea, I've complained about this before on this sub, but I guess it's likely never going to change. It's just a different world than I grew up in and people seem to place a lot of stock in what other's opinions are on what they should read, see or listen to next.  When I was growing up once I discovered an author like King I would just try to get my hands on whatever I could from the library or bookmobile and just read them. There was no instant outlet for asking other people's opinions. I went by what the synopsis on the back of the book said and if it sounded interesting to me or if it had a cool book cover.   It's the same as people jumping on reddit the moment they finish a book or come from a movie to give their ""review"" or opinion. I like to discuss the things I like certainly, but what some stranger thinks about something isn't going to sway me either way as to whether or not I'm going to try something. If it looks like something I might like I'm going to read or watch it regardless.  As far as the order of something it's so easy to hop on the internet and find out the order in which his books came out. I appreciate the enthusiasm of new readers, but I too would love to see less ""What should I read next?"" and ""What order should I read his books in?"" around here."
stephenking,36cepr,mcgruppp,1 point,Mon May 18 13:14:04 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Plus, I would assume that's the way King (and many other authors publishing books at that time) wants his books to be read. Yeah, there's a little bit of a correlation between the books, but does that detract or add anything to the main story? I think not (yes I understand that's debatable but that's  my opinion)."
stephenking,36cepr,Saijar,1 point,Tue May 19 04:40:46 2015 UTC,"I agree. If you read DT before the stories it references, you get the ""oh shit"" factor when you read the other story. I don't think I read any of the related novels until after the DT books, because I lived gunslinger so much and needed mote if that story, so I didn't have the drive to put it down"
stephenking,36cepr,docwilson,1 point,Mon May 18 15:34:48 2015 UTC,"The Dark Tower books were my first seven Stephen King books. After completing Tower, any reference from other books was much more thrilling than I think it would have been the other way around; the way so many suggest. I really liked insomnia when all was said and done, but knowing there were references to DT coming was the only thing that made me get to the end of that one in a manageable time frame."
stephenking,36cepr,sedtimmons,1 point,Mon May 18 22:21:30 2015 UTC,"I agree in principle but I can see at least one good reason to have a few of the novels under your belt before tackling DT. It is a seven book commitment after all, and none of the volumes really works as a stand alone.   But in principle i agree, no, you don't have to read all the connecting books first.   People need to realize that the connections in king books are more like easter eggs than anything else. They don't move the plot, they are there as a wink and a nod to fans."
stephenking,36biog,Dim_Innuendo,11,Mon May 18 01:12:00 2015 UTC,"Religious allegory is obviously a big part of the work. Like sai-King said, it's not exactly subtle. Allegory often isn't--look at Orwell. But the books explores more than that. It explores themes of guilt, of punishment, and of morality. What is the right thing? Paul clearly knew he could save the Warden's wife and he did, but he also still allowed Coffey to die after saving that life. Yes, it was  a mercy, but still, it was murder. What guilt does Paul feel for that? Is his long life a blessing, or a punishment? What does God want?  I love the book, but there is so much more to it than a Christ-allegory. Keep researching, though, because it's one of the best things King has ever written!"
stephenking,36biog,MercurialForce,3,Mon May 18 01:18:20 2015 UTC,"Honestly I never noticed. Other than Paul E.'s viewing Coffey from a 1930's religious viewpoint I never made the connection. Not being a religious person I probably never will. It's a good story. John C has a power, no one knows where it comes from as it's never explained. King put that in there on purpose I will assume but being a good writer like he is, the different readers will take away different things."

But I just recently started re-reading Salem's Lot and noticed some striking similarities to Under the Dome.  The most obvious similarity to me so far is between Sandy McDougall and Sammy Bushey. Both characters are young mothers each of whom has an infant boy, they each live in a small trailer on the edge of town, and they're unhappy with the way their lives are turning out. They both got married when they got knocked up, to men whom they don't love, and who they're both cheating on. I can't remember if Sammy actually physically abuses her son the way Sandy does, but I seem to recall that she did at least harbor some resentment toward her baby the same way Sandy does.  Also, both towns have a Deep Cut Road.  There may be more, but it's been a few years since I read Under the Dome, and these are the ones that are screaming out at me."

stephenking,368zvt,Rev_Jim_lgnatowski,7,Sun May 17 17:10:23 2015 UTC,Eyes of the Dragon sounds good for you seeing as you love fantasy novels. It's a nice little contained story which has a good few ties to Dark Tower but can be enjoyed just as much on its own.
stephenking,368zvt,lemonloafer,1 point,Sun May 17 15:29:16 2015 UTC,I second Eyes of the Dragon. You could finish this one in a day.
stephenking,368zvt,mikethetechie,11,Mon May 18 01:05:47 2015 UTC,11/22/63.  It is a good mix of fantasy and reality.  And a great story.
stephenking,368zvt,leesugarballs,3,Sun May 17 11:07:17 2015 UTC,"I'll second this. Super accessible, amazing story, and new enough that it shouldn't be hard to find in stores.  Also, if there's a specific one from his older stuff you like I'm pretty sure several users here would pick you up a paperback and ship it or something. Never be afraid to check into the kindness of strangers."
stephenking,368zvt,clwestbr,3,Sun May 17 19:17:55 2015 UTC,I really think you should try and start with his short stories. That's how I fell in love with king. Night shift is from the 70's/80's but king books are always being reprinted. So it shouldn't be to hard to find that. You will figure out really quick if you like his writing style. Ps the stand is good but one of my least favorites.
stephenking,368zvt,capt_make_it_happen,3,Sun May 17 15:00:50 2015 UTC,"I always recommend starting from the beginning: Carrie, Salem's Lot, or The Shining. You can't go wrong with any of those. Are you able to shop and order online?"
stephenking,368zvt,qqzqq,3,Sun May 17 16:16:35 2015 UTC,Personally I really love his short story collections. Everything's Eventual is a good newer one to start with.
stephenking,368zvt,deviger,3,Sun May 17 19:12:14 2015 UTC,"I don't know too much about his horror but I think The Stand is pretty indicative of King's non-horror stuff. Strong characters, interesting story with a bit of a cop-out ending but still great all-around.  It's about a superplague that destroys 99.4 percent of humanity, and in the resulting chaos survivors band together into two camps: One led by an elderly matriarch and the other by an evil sorceror. It also ties into The Dark Tower, so you can try The Gunslinger and Drawing of the Three afterwards (Gunslinger is pretty amateur but Drawing is really good so stick with the Dark Tower series)."
stephenking,368zvt,Nichase,2,Sun May 17 10:08:34 2015 UTC,"I started off with From A Buick 8. It's an alright book and it's relatively short.  I love his great books like The Stand and 11/22/63 but I wouldn't recommend starting off with those because they may set your standards just a bit too high.  So I would recommend From A Buick 8, Cujo, or Christine (those were the first three books I read from King). They're really great and entertaining reads and they won't launch your expectations of King into the stratosphere (yet)."
stephenking,368zvt,TheVoiceofKroeger,2,Sun May 17 16:49:21 2015 UTC,"'Salems Lot would be a good one in my opinion because it's pretty darn scary, not overly long, and is one of Kings best in terms of description and imagination. Out of the 15-20 King books I've read, 'Salems Lot is probably my favorite followed closely by The Stand, Misery, and Different Seasons  (4 novellas in one book), which all include deep well drawn out characters. Some of his collections of short stories (Night Shift, Skeleton Crew) are great as well. Hope you enjoy whatever you choose!"
stephenking,368zvt,frickinfrack09,1 point,Tue May 19 03:59:00 2015 UTC,"Hey! I just want to suggest, if it's possible for you, possibly looking into e-book versions of stuff you can't find paper copies of. Even if you don't have a kindle or a nook, iirc both have available applications on most computers, and you might be able to download digital copies to read on the computer or on a smartphone. Not everyone's style, but I like reading that way as well, and can often find kindle versions of books with much less difficulty than a lot of hardcopies. It isn't as novel, but it's cheaper and, in my case, lighter weight.  Just a thought. Happy reading!"
stephenking,368zvt,imthebar,1 point,Tue May 19 02:43:31 2015 UTC,The Talisman if you must have fantasy. It was reprinted recently.  Short story collections are the best place for new readers. You can get a variety of story types to Better grasp the King oeuvre.

They aren't exactly fantasy books, but almost all of my previous reading experiences were. The heroes in  both books were simple, but likeable, and their powers were cool. Everyone here seems to be leaning toward The Tower and The Stand. But I'd encourage you to start smaller and get a feel for the author first."

stephenking,368zvt,DiegoGooner,1 point,Sun May 17 18:31:07 2015 UTC,Others may disagree but I'd start with Under the Dome. It's nowhere near his best but it's a good book and a fun read and it will sort of ease you in to the way King writes. Enjoy.
stephenking,368zvt,yt_nom,3,Sun May 17 20:26:03 2015 UTC,"If it weren't a bajillion pages long I'd agree with you, as I really enjoyed that book. I think as far as ""easing"" someone into his style of writing I'd probably recommend a short stories collection or something like ""different seasons"" that has a nice blend of his dramatic writing and a sample of horror writing as well."
stephenking,368zvt,Sargentrock,1 point,Sun May 17 20:55:47 2015 UTC,I get where you're coming from but King is always long. Might as well just jump into the deep end in that sense.

stephenking,3662cr,JimmyWaters,6,Sat May 16 15:01:25 2015 UTC,"I just started reading King. Bought Under the Dome a couple years back, when the show was about to come out, started reading and couldn't get through it. I wasn't used to King, and meeting a million characters all at once, I couldn't keep up with who was who. I quit reading and picked it up again and forced myself to get through it. I enjoyed it, but not anywhere near how much I enjoyed 11/22/63.  I absolutely couldn't stop reading. I'd be thinking all day about what was going to happen next, couldn't wait to get back to the story. That was an excellent book to get me hooked on King, because that's the one that did it, certainly not Under the Dome."
stephenking,3662cr,Grimlocks_Ballsack,4,Sat May 16 15:06:27 2015 UTC,"Both. And these are probably the other two books that I felt were also special and different. There are a lot of good books, but they aren't like these."

stephenking,3662cr,jotaesethegeek,5,Sat May 16 19:25:03 2015 UTC,"Thought it was a great book, but for some reason I enjoyed the Derry section and Jake's life in Jodie/his relationship with Sadie much more than the actual stop-Oswalt plot. Most people seem to think of 11/22/63 as his greatest 'late-era' book, and I can definitely see why they say that, considering how well crafted it is, but I think I'm in the tiny minority of people who likes Revival more than any of his other recent works (except Joyland maybe)."
stephenking,3662cr,jpflathead,2,Sat May 16 19:42:44 2015 UTC,"I liked Revival a lot, but a lot of critics said it was poorly written.  I didn't really get that...thoughts?"
stephenking,3662cr,jpflathead,3,Sat May 16 19:49:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think it was poorly written, in that I found it all interesting and well told, but I do think the structure impeded the atmosphere a little bit. The narration wandering through Jamie's life took detours from the underlying Frankenstein-Lovecraft story which I felt could've been cut down a little bit, the creepy moments in the story really stood out (the whole ""something happened"" motif was great, I kept thinking about it), but I did think it would've benefited from less life story between these moments.   I've also heard some criticism of the ending, claiming it came out of left field, which to me signifies those people just aren't familiar with Lovecraft-esque stories (silly considering the book began with a Lovecraft quote, you'd think people might do some cursory googling). I thought the final climax scene maybe could've been a bit grander, but I liked it all the same. I was also very appreciative of the total downer ending, I love it when a horror story wraps up like that.  Overall I thought Jacobs and Jamie were some of the best King characters in a while, and I love Lovecraft homages, so for me it was a great book."
stephenking,3662cr,FreddieBJ,1 point,Sun May 17 03:23:59 2015 UTC,I read the Audible version and the 'something happened' set to the tune of Happy Birthday was excellently creepy.   I thought the ending could have been more elaborate but eh. It was nice to read a fairly concise thriller from King. The electricity/evangelism themes paired nicely.

It is plotted by Robin Furth and scripted by Peter David. Stephen King serves as Creative and Executive Director of the project.  The first chapter run of the series consists of 30 issues that make up five volumes illustrated by Jae Lee and Richard Isanove. The first volume, The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger Born, is based primarily on flashbacks from The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger and The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass; the later ones are new content.  As stated by Peter David's afterword to The Long Road Home, the series details Roland Deschain's ""progress from callow youth to gunslinger,"" starting with his adventures in Mejis from Wizard and Glass and ending with the Battle of Jericho Hill (as detailed in The Dark Tower V: Wolves of the Calla and The Dark Tower VII: The Dark Tower).

I'm a constant reader of king but virtually all of his works are disturbing in some way so they are not for everyone.  His greatest strength in my opinion is to find a way to make you really like his characters.  Then he tortures them.  Reading that type of story shouldn't be forced on someone.

stephenking,35zpj2,1015192122,44,Thu May 14 21:34:01 2015 UTC,The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon - I've seen it get a lot of stick on here but I really enjoyed and found it genuinely creepy towards the end.
stephenking,35zpj2,Jparm,5,Thu May 14 23:20:27 2015 UTC,"I was coming here to say this.  I loved that book, but no one else I know really did.  I also thought it was super creepy and just awesome.  I haven't read it for a while, but I have been thinking about picking it up again."
stephenking,35zpj2,dogtographer,4,Fri May 15 01:56:53 2015 UTC,It's a good book. Very different from most of King's work--and I like that. It's good to see the different things he can do.
stephenking,35zpj2,pleurocarp,1 point,Fri May 15 03:10:14 2015 UTC,"That was my first King book.  Read it for a book report in 5th-ish grade, freaked out the teaher that I was reading an adult-book, while the smartest kids in the class were reading Animorphs."

stephenking,35zpj2,brightshinies,22,Fri May 15 07:15:27 2015 UTC,I quite enjoyed From a Buick 8.
stephenking,35zpj2,theshallowdrowned,7,Thu May 14 22:02:16 2015 UTC,This one is really underrated in my mind.  It was a very contained story and it left a lot for the reader to infer.  I can appreciate a story like that.  I love world building but there is something to be said about leaving things mysterious and I think this book does a good job of that.
stephenking,35zpj2,Leslie_Chowder,1 point,Thu May 14 22:56:23 2015 UTC,"Exactly. And the way it shifts viewpoints from character to character is harder to accomplish than people think, and King does it perfectly in this book."
stephenking,35zpj2,theshallowdrowned,4,Fri May 15 14:55:39 2015 UTC,"The change in setting was refreshing. I love reading about Maine, hell, I live in Maine, but I think King did a great job of portraying western PA."
stephenking,35zpj2,Giggity_1981,3,Thu May 14 23:31:18 2015 UTC,"He did. I'm from western pa, so the western pa stories really stick with me. He was Able to ride around with state troopers In butler pa to get a feel for the area."

stephenking,35zpj2,SlendersSuit,2,Fri May 15 02:47:16 2015 UTC,I enjoyed that one a lot as well.
stephenking,35zpj2,zcgk,2,Fri May 15 02:01:33 2015 UTC,"From a Buick 8 seemed to come from the same place you might feel revulsion at dissecting a frog in biology class as a kid.  Only having come to grips with that as an adult he took it to another level.  It's a weird, fucked up story.  Not really frightening but definitely horrific."
stephenking,35zpj2,dogtographer,17,Fri May 15 06:40:09 2015 UTC,"Gerald's Game. And related to that, Deloris Claiborne (sp?)"
stephenking,35zpj2,poopiedoo7,6,Thu May 14 22:26:47 2015 UTC,Gerald's Game is the only King book that actually really legitimately scared the crap out of me.  Good shit!
stephenking,35zpj2,Leslie_Chowder,4,Fri May 15 02:00:44 2015 UTC,"I really loved Gerald's Game. How he managed to keep me that involved in a story set entirely with one woman handcuffed to a bed, I will never know. I couldn't put it down."
stephenking,35zpj2,IrishBoJackson,2,Fri May 15 01:15:42 2015 UTC,Could you explain?  This is one of the few I've not read.  I can't remember what the premise is but for whatever reason it didn't look interesting or maybe it just didn't seem like a sk book.
stephenking,35zpj2,IrishBoJackson,3,Thu May 14 23:00:30 2015 UTC,"Guy and girl get kinky. Handcuffs. One dies, the other is stuck."
stephenking,35zpj2,teejayniu,4,Thu May 14 23:07:47 2015 UTC,I will admit to avoiding Gerald's Game because I found the premise pretty horrifying. Not sure if I can stomach it.
stephenking,35zpj2,IrishBoJackson,3,Thu May 14 23:33:30 2015 UTC,"I was wondering if this may have played a role in it being less than popular. Even among horror fans there are those of us who find discussing these topics to be crude (though King isn't exactly known for being gentle-tongued), so the audience is automatically limited by default. I find most of his books to be more fantasy than horror personally, which would possibly generate a larger audience vs horror, and more people + wider sample means more people not comfortable reading ""Seduction, Pseudo-Bondage, Sadness and Sick: How To Escape When You Find Yourself Alone In The Woods In Handcuffs"".  *I loved it. Of course, I read it as a 17-or-so year old male, so read into that what you will."
stephenking,35zpj2,Leslie_Chowder,4,Thu May 14 23:56:41 2015 UTC,"I just read Gerald's Game earlier this year and hated it. Started strong and had such an awesome premise, but it dragged on for way too long. All the inner monologue stuff was so boring after a while. I was glad to be done with this one."
stephenking,35zpj2,IrishBoJackson,34,Fri May 15 02:26:33 2015 UTC,"Dark Tower V-VII... most people seem to dislike the popular culture references and King stuff, but I thought it was a great take on an alternate reality. Loved it.  *to add to this, I really adored how it turned the mind into a reality generating device, which in a way it is."
stephenking,35zpj2,Leslie_Chowder,14,Thu May 14 21:54:16 2015 UTC,"I agree.  Totally loved all the things people typically hate.  The ending seems like the only way it could have ended.  The inclusion of Stephen king as a character really worked for me.  The pop and literary references, just all of it was great.  All that said,  I'd rate I-III as better.  I barely made it through IV.  The man cannot write love stories, but it was certainly important to Roland's story."
stephenking,35zpj2,IrishBoJackson,9,Thu May 14 22:53:49 2015 UTC,"I agree completely, with one difference. I absolutely loved IV. If I wasn't hooked after II or III, IV would've done it. I loved the love story, Rhea, the glass, what felt like the beginning of the pop culture references with Oz. Probably my favorite book of the series.  *edited wrong post"
stephenking,35zpj2,frostfromfire,3,Thu May 14 23:01:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah,  I've found that you either love IV or hate it.  Your points ring true.  I'm on III on a rereading of the series so I will be more open minded this time.  Thankee sai"

stephenking,35zpj2,IrishBoJackson,3,Fri May 15 02:04:13 2015 UTC,"I breezed through I-III (especially II and III), but I struggled through IV. It wasn't until maybe 300 pages in that I actually enjoyed the story and was reading it for the sake of it instead of reading it to get to the next book. I'm taking a break before I start Wolves of the Calla."
stephenking,35zpj2,MercurialForce,1 point,Fri May 15 16:26:00 2015 UTC,Wolves is much more exciting and action-packed IMO.
stephenking,35zpj2,silentpat530,1 point,Sun May 17 03:28:40 2015 UTC,"Sorry for replying again, but to be honest, it may be the only love story I've read (I'm a non-fiction guy, Crichton or King is all the fiction I need). Perhaps the writing of the love tale isn't so good, but I didn't notice. I certainly felt it in my heart though. Thinking of her on that pole in the heat was brutal. I understood why he became such a hard man. Your mileage may vary I suppose."
stephenking,35zpj2,capaldithenewblack,2,Fri May 15 01:02:22 2015 UTC,"Have you read 11/22/63? The man can write love stories, I just don't think he did an excellent job of it in Wizard and Glass."
stephenking,35zpj2,GaijinSama,1 point,Fri May 15 08:05:03 2015 UTC,"I disagree with you there, i think he captures love very well. Wizard and Glass might be my favorite in the series. And the love story of 11/22/63 is phenomenal as well."
stephenking,35zpj2,ThomasSirveaux,2,Sat May 23 06:57:51 2015 UTC,"Yes-- I loved the way he dropped the fourth wall and put himself in the story! Was a little surprised that many didn't care for it. I was reading it out loud, going nuts (in a good way)."
stephenking,35zpj2,Todash_Chimes,2,Fri May 15 03:50:19 2015 UTC,"I prefer those books to the ones before it. It had a much better forward momentum, because King had finally decided on a way to end the series. Love it or hate it, that decision gave the stories more tension than the previous entries."
stephenking,35zpj2,CrackedP0t,2,Fri May 15 04:01:50 2015 UTC,"I hated it my first time through. My second time I got what he was doing and liked it a lot more. The Dark Tower is a hub of universes, but it's all universes that could exist, including literary ones. So when it starts to break down, the boundaries between them get fuzzy and we start to see shit from Harry Potter and Fantastic Four and Star Wars show up. And we even see the ""real world,"" which is our own universe in which the Dark Tower is just a story created by Stephen King. If the characters found themselves in our world, of course they'd look up the guy that wrote the stories. That's the logical next step."
stephenking,35zpj2,standingintheshadows,2,Fri May 15 12:51:25 2015 UTC,Book 7 is tied with book 2 for me. I love the stuff about the Breakers and the ending. Don't get the hate.

stephenking,35zpj2,ThomasSirveaux,9,Wed May 20 14:46:37 2015 UTC,"To a lesser extent, Revival. Not a universally hated book, but it seemed as if an alarming amount of King fans disliked it. I was really swept away with the story, and I think the language was more polished, personal, and intimate than most King novels.   Also, as far as short stories go, I really fucking loved ""Sneakers,"" and it seems a lot of fans generally hate it. To me, it's one of the best things he's written. Mystery? Check. Horror? Check. Freudian psychoanalytic layers? Check. Also, hearing David Cronenberg tell this story on audiobook is a highly pleasurable experience."
stephenking,35zpj2,amoryamory,-4,Thu May 14 21:52:05 2015 UTC,"an alarming amount of King fans disliked it.   Not at all surprising to me, giving the disdain that the main character has for religion."
stephenking,35zpj2,hurrikane94,6,Fri May 15 02:01:06 2015 UTC,I've never seen this come up as a reason to dislike Revival.  I didn't really enjoy it and I'm not religious so that had no impact on my reading of the book.  It had too many scenes that didn't further the book along and the ending seemed like another example of SK not knowing how to wrap up a book.  He just put a preposterous ending and let it be.  The main character was alright but I would have preferred to have more character development and insight into the life of the preacher.
stephenking,35zpj2,amoryamory,2,Fri May 15 02:11:10 2015 UTC,"I'm from the South; I know a lot of very religious people who would have refused to finish this book.   And the ending is an homage to Lovecraft. I liked it, but I can definitely understand how people who aren't familiar with Lovecraft wouldn't appreciate it."
stephenking,35zpj2,ProfessorLake,-4,Fri May 15 02:17:36 2015 UTC,"The ending felt like a crapshoot, he killed off lots of likeable minor characters for no reason, but the part that made me dislike it was that the book seems to have no theme, no underlying message, which can't be said for most King books.   I honestly thought the crazy Reverend who enjoyed rooking religious people and laughing at them for their naivity might be a metaphor for what Stephen King was doing with this book: selling us a load of crap and laughing as people bought it."
stephenking,35zpj2,memphis171,2,Fri May 15 03:15:27 2015 UTC,I'm not at all religious but I didn't like Revival all that much. It would have been fine as a short story but it meandered around for too long. I did like the ending but I feel like it took too long to get there.
stephenking,35zpj2,momzill,2,Fri May 15 13:04:50 2015 UTC,I can somewhat agree with that. I liked the ending but I wish it was fleshed out a little more.

stephenking,35zpj2,TheDanimal438,2,Fri May 15 03:33:51 2015 UTC,This is one of my favorite King books. The way the story builds was fantastic and the relationship between father and daughter sucked me in. It was such an amazing book all around and it is a shame it is forgotten by so many King readers.
stephenking,35zpj2,silentpat530,1 point,Fri May 15 04:39:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it is a shame. I love the father/daughter relationship, and the backstory with the Lot 6 experiments is super interesting to me too."

stephenking,35zpj2,sixfeetunder,6,Fri May 15 17:21:05 2015 UTC,The thing that makes Christine a tough read is the total shift in narration from first person to third. You can tell the moment that King wrote himself into a corner.
stephenking,35zpj2,ChronoTravis85,1 point,Thu May 14 23:16:21 2015 UTC,"Well, Christine was the third King book I've read, right after The Shining and Pet Semetary. So I was in my King honeymoon phase, I suppose. I haven't read it since, but it does have a special place in my heart."

stephenking,35zpj2,Nichase,2,Fri May 15 00:58:02 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm pretty sure you aren't alone there. Some really great story telling and homages to some great westerns.
stephenking,35zpj2,silentpat530,1 point,Sat May 23 07:01:53 2015 UTC,I thought so too until I got on reddit and found that a lot of people don't seem to like it so much because it's to much of a homage to The Magnificent Seven and the Seven Samurai.
stephenking,35zpj2,Leslie_Chowder,1 point,Sun May 24 00:47:50 2015 UTC,Stephen King himself said in one of his prologue/epilogues that he wanted to drop Gray Matter from Night Shift. It's undoubtedly my favourite short story of his.

stephenking,35zpj2,Phifty2,1 point,Thu May 14 22:26:23 2015 UTC,"It's kind of an in-betweener novel, as far as where it fits into the series' plot. Did you read it when it came out? I have a suspicion that people would like it better if they were coming right off Wolves of the Calla and heading to VII right after."
stephenking,35zpj2,Saijar,1 point,Fri May 15 03:12:10 2015 UTC,"I thought it was very good. I liked the dynamic between Susannah and Mia, and I thought Mia was a good antagonist. The fight at the gas station was cool and the meeting with Stephen King was cool (even if I hated the direction it took in Vol. 7). The final climax (the birth of mordred) was cool and there was good development for all the characters (although any development was completely ignored in Volume VII). Also, it wasn't five hundred pages.  I did not read it when it first came out. I started it the day after I finished Wolves of the Calla and started Vol VII the day after. I suppose you're right, but the novel was really well done."
stephenking,35zpj2,cosmovern71,1 point,Fri May 15 18:37:25 2015 UTC,"My problem with it is that it just felt like it didn't need to be a book at all. Nearly nothing happens, and it's all a build to the last book. If it got cut right in half, and you stick some on the end of five and some on the beginning of seven, that'd be just fine. There isn't much wrong with the plot in it, just that there isn't much in my opinion."
stephenking,35zpj2,stillbatting1000,-3,Sat May 23 07:04:39 2015 UTC,"Tommyknockers.  Just kidding, that book was awful.  Only sk book I couldn't finish.  I heard that this was his final book before he began his sobriety.  Not sure if that is true."

Stephen Weber's narration is amazing.   Runners up would be the Dark Tower series, The Talisman/Black House, and 11/22/63"

stephenking,361540,spacebrew,5,Fri May 15 15:09:00 2015 UTC,"It.  I went in thinking there'd be no way Steven Weber's Pennywise voice could measure up but he nailed It, It and every other character.

I know I'm probably missing a few but honestly, I don't think you can go wrong.  I've been listening to SK audio books for the last 6 months or so while at work and I started in sort of a general chronological order so I still have lots to go.  The only one I had to restart several times and I still can't seem to get my head into is The Gunslinger."
stephenking,3600p6,Leslie_Chowder,6,Thu May 14 23:04:47 2015 UTC,"If I was gonna do it, I would make a new character, one we've never met before. He would, somehow, stumble into different timelines. Maybe traveling through the thinnies? SPOILERS! In one movie/episode, he protects the rose somehow. In the next one, he makes sure the Trashcan Man finds what he needs to find in the desert. The next time, he makes sure a certain werewolf can't get to a little boy hiding in a shed. Stephen King is really good at getting us to believe in serendipity, and maybe this guy is an agent of that somehow."
stephenking,3600p6,Deweyrob2,6,Fri May 15 01:39:02 2015 UTC,"This isn't a bad idea at all, but I don't think it would work as well just because it would require a lot of prerequisite knowledge.   An ideal situation would be a movie introducing Roland and Flagg, then you just build from there. You show the different paths Roland and Flagg take, the effects they have on their own worlds and the worlds they cross over.   I feel like your idea would be a good tv series companion to a larger movie-verse, much like Agents of Shield is a nice companion to the larger MCU."

stephenking,35z2nm,jeromerules,8,Thu May 14 18:40:14 2015 UTC,"I quite liked it (I reread it every so often when I'm bored) but it's also my go-to example of how Stephen King is not very good at endings. I do think it's well worth a read. It has some fairly likable characters, some extremely hateable characters, and a fairly interesting plot. I didn't realize it was polarizing - I would have thought it would be middling at worse.  I would say the book I felt it most resembled was ""It"" (and these are only spoilers if you know absolutely nothing about either book) where they're both about a supernatural entity who kind of feed off a town, and you get to see a wide variety of consequences for various inhabitants, not to mention the endings pulled out of nowhere. Even so, they're quite different, especially in that It is fairly scary in my opinion, while Needful Things isn't really, but it's still interesting. It's a fun read. I'd recommend it."
stephenking,35z2nm,Vixlari,3,Thu May 14 19:37:49 2015 UTC,it's also my go-to example of how Stephen King is not very good at endings.   Mine is Insomnia. Except it's not so much the ending as much as the entire second half of the book that I dislike.
stephenking,35z2nm,Brendan42,6,Thu May 14 23:36:38 2015 UTC,"It is not the best Stephen King book, but it might be the most Stephen King book."
stephenking,35z2nm,JohnLocke815,3,Fri May 15 01:16:03 2015 UTC,One of my favs
stephenking,35z2nm,drumthumper,3,Thu May 14 23:44:46 2015 UTC,"Caveat Emptor.   Read into it what you will.   In all seriousness though, I really enjoyed the book. The only King book that I didn't care for was Insomnia. Took me nearly 2 years to finish it. Talk about SLOW."
stephenking,35z2nm,Nimbacinus,2,Fri May 15 00:23:00 2015 UTC,"I've been meaning to get to it shortly myself. From my understanding it was meant to be the last Castle Rock book, a farewell to the town... Might explain some of the polarization?"
stephenking,35z2nm,Wtayjay,2,Thu May 14 18:55:59 2015 UTC,"I loved it. Of course, it was my first King book, and everyone feels a special connection to their first one. But I thought it was great."
stephenking,35z2nm,SaulTBauls,2,Thu May 14 19:26:49 2015 UTC,"I just finished it. I really enjoyed it and thought it really reminded me of 'Salems Lot in the way the story was told. The only negative I could think of was the repetitiveness of what Gaunt does. Aside from that, it was a great book."
stephenking,35z2nm,Hydrochloric,2,Thu May 14 19:47:38 2015 UTC,Good book on the whole. I personally think the pacing and tone feels like a cross of Salem's lot with Under the Dome. Although it does have the worst ending of any King book I've read so far.
stephenking,35z2nm,MadDingersYo,2,Thu May 14 20:05:02 2015 UTC,Loved it. I've read over 50 SK books and it's somewhere in my top 10.
stephenking,35z2nm,Neit01,1 point,Fri May 15 00:08:44 2015 UTC,I have read quite a few King books and it is not his best but it's definitely not his worst in my opinion. I really enjoyed it. I would definitely recommend it to a Stephen King fan if they hadn't read it yet. It reminds me the most of Salem's Lot. You have the one main antagonist that has special powers (for lack of a better term) causing a ruckus in a small town.
stephenking,35z2nm,rflagg024,1 point,Thu May 14 19:29:24 2015 UTC,"One of those rare exceptions where the movie was better.  Actually, the trailer was better.  ""In the Hall of the Mountain King"" blaring with Max von Sydow's creepy fingernails, puns and laugh.  Great stuff."

I picked it up again years later and was able to finally finish it. I liked it on the second try, as I was older and wiser. It's probably one of my least favorite though."

Thinner and Needful Things were two 'scary movies' my parents let me see when I was a kid, though, so they hold a special place in my heart.

stephenking,35vvdr,docwilson,2,Thu May 14 02:51:12 2015 UTC,I absolutely loved Mr. Mercedes. I thought it was an excellent break from normal King and it made for an excellent beach book on my honeymoon. I'm just interested to see how Finders Keepers fits in with the the story.
stephenking,35vvdr,SaulTBauls,2,Thu May 14 12:52:59 2015 UTC,It's the second of three
stephenking,35vvdr,Hello_Cup,2,Thu May 14 16:43:30 2015 UTC,"Reading Mr. Mercedes now, about half-way through. I'm enjoying it, a lot, but I do find it to be one of the lesser King novels (with that being said, I loved Revival -- the other 2014 release -- to pieces, and I'm at odds with the general opinion that Mr. Mercedes is better). It's fast-paced, engaging, and I am dying to see how it unwinds, but I do have many gripes with it. The language is way less polished, the characters are wooden, the plot itself is hardly original, the dialogue is my vote for King's most poorly written (must we revisit the Trolls under the bridge scene? ""My mama sick. I goin to get her medicine,"" is quite possibly the worst and unrealistic attempt at writing street Ebonics. Nobody in the hood talks like that, King.), I feel zero connection with Detective Hodges, and the discussions of race in the novel are more awkward, forced, and offensive than they are progressive or substantive.   Maybe these quirks are more noticeable because I'm coming fresh off of reading ""1922,"" which is a goddamn gothic masterpiece. I feel like I went from reading Poe to reading Dean Koontz, and it's not sitting too well. In fact, now that I say it, Mr. Mercedes is basically a Dean Koontz book. Meh."
stephenking,35vvdr,jeromerules,-1,Thu May 14 21:55:50 2015 UTC,"I did NOT like Revival for one reason and it STILL irritates me.  I liked the story line, I liked the premise (the electrical experiments, even the 'ultimate' one) but without providing spoilers, I'll just saying really bugged me about that book.  That just seemed so out of place and didn't fit, for me.    I really enjoyed Mr. Mercedes though!"
stephenking,35vvdr,misstia,2,Thu May 14 17:31:26 2015 UTC,"I really liked Mr. Mercedes.  I was sort of disappointed to see that Finders Keepers is NOT about Mr. Mercedes waking up and say, escaping from the hospital; but maybe that'll be in the third book, as he said he envisioned a trilogy.  I am looking forward to this though."
stephenking,35uvpf,EnIdiot,8,Wed May 13 18:32:51 2015 UTC,"It might be.  All of King's books are tied by the Tower across all universes.  It has been a while since I read It, but I believe that the turtle at the end is one of the Beam's guardians. If not the same world, then a very close one."

stephenking,35uvpf,citizenpuppet,11,Wed May 13 20:25:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but in the revision, IIRC, the date was moved up to 1990. That would put It before The Stand."
stephenking,35uvpf,Sylar_Lives,8,Wed May 13 20:52:31 2015 UTC,^ This. The original cut isn't canon.
stephenking,35uvpf,chillbill69,-1,Thu May 14 00:34:36 2015 UTC,"No, more like the revised cut isn't canon. The original story was written in 1978. He only changed the dates later and added the parts he didn't include in the original.  From your figuring then Under the Dome was written in the same time period as well since ""The Cannibals"" was started in the 70's but wasn't finished until Under the Dome was published."
stephenking,35uvpf,Sylar_Lives,2,Thu May 14 02:22:55 2015 UTC,"That doesn't apply to Under the Dome at all, as The Cannibals was never a finished work. The revised edition of The Stand is the only version still in print, much like the special editions of the original Star Wars trilogy, and thus replaces the original print in the canon. This also applies to King's revised edition of The Gunslinger."

stephenking,35uvpf,KicksButtson,2,Wed May 13 21:18:36 2015 UTC,"It's basically a Stephen King multiverse, like King's own version of string theory.  This is honestly one of my biggest criticisms of King's work because to me the one thing most deserving of criticism is when someone is given credit they don't deserve.   King is constantly given credit for his connected universe, yet his universe is actually a multiverse. Multiple realms for different stories to take place with only vague references to one another that really have only a trivial correlation.  This is the same crap that comic books do where they have multiple different universes for each franchise so they can revamp the story again and again in different ways. At least the comics do it so they can recycle a franchise and tell new stories.  King does it because he wants to tell different stories, some which would technically contradict the others, so he makes a multiverse where basically anything can happen if he wants it to. When it comes to connected story lines that is basically cheating.  They're not really a connected universe if the only thing connecting them is a multidimensional pathway which almost never gets brought up as a main topic in the books that aren't specifically about it."

stephenking,35swqm,THE-1138,7,Wed May 13 06:08:28 2015 UTC,"I think I enjoyed the first half of the book more than the second half. I don't know...just the way the characters were introduced (and the development of most of them later on as well) I thought was done so well. I think that small journey before all of them met up in Boulder of just getting to know Frannie, Stu, Nick, Larry etc and getting so immersed in what each were going through at the time is what I'll look back on as the most fun I had reading it.  Concerning the second half, I really liked the whole time Stu and Tom Cullen met up too. Tom was a great guy laws yes!  Most of the moments with Flagg were pretty crazy and eye opening too. I totally get why he's such a popular character.   That's all I can think up right now. But there are definitely a lot more I might have just forgot about."
stephenking,35swqm,a-sober-irishman,1 point,Wed May 13 06:24:24 2015 UTC,"What about the tunnel?? haha  That part blew my mind. I saw King's talent in full force there.   I thought the second half of the book was a bit of a let down, too. I read something where King was stuck when they got to Colorado and it took him a while to figure out how to deal with it then it came to him in a flash."
stephenking,35swqm,Zachisasloth,1 point,Wed May 13 06:51:19 2015 UTC,"Laws yes I loved the parts with Tom and Stu! I knew it was going to be him as soon as Stu heard someone climbing up the bank.

Also how Tom saved Stu's life by listening to Nick, who could talk and hear!"

I like to imagine that they were able to rebuild society, but it'd be cool to get a sequel on the struggles of it and what it winds up being like. Also, a follow up on what Flagg does after washing up onto the land with the savages (if that's not covered in the Dark Tower series or others in King's alternate universe)."

stephenking,35pztb,Leslie_Chowder,8,Wed May 13 16:32:40 2015 UTC,"I think I've got to go with 'It'.   There's a sense of dread throughout the book, that is just 'driving past a car crash' attention grabbing - you know if you pay more attention, you might end up shocked, but that doesn't dissuade you.   Also, I've never been to Maine (nor grown up in the 50's), but boy was King able to really paint a picture. I feel like I'm there when I read the book.   Then you've got the antagonists (not just Pennywise,  there's monsters in human form throughout too) and  protagonists.   This probably comes across as gushing, but I can't help it."

People complain about it being too slow but I love the buildup to the heartbreaking ending."
stephenking,35pztb,thefireworkdays,2,Wed May 13 00:18:07 2015 UTC,Pet Semetary. That book haunted me.
stephenking,35pztb,Disclaimers,1 point,Wed May 13 01:04:25 2015 UTC,"Mine may be an unpopular one. To give some credibility to my opinion, I have been an avid Constant Reader. I have not read all of King's books, however I have a growing collection the includes many of his short story collections, and just about anything to do with the Dark Tower, and different levels of the Dark Tower (see Bev Vincent's The Road to the Dark Tower). I love them all. Before reading Mr. Mercedes, The Dark Tower series was by far my favorite books by King.   I went into reading Mr. Mercedes expecting a classic King science fiction thriller. I went in looking for the fantasy, and something to make me uneasy and scared. What I found was his writing style applied in a way that I did not expect. It was a cop story with a bad guy who made me angrier than Big Jim Rennie. It was no punches held crime chase, get the bad guy before he does something worse, where the bad guy did more bad stuff in a way that many other authors hold back, and only King could accomplish. It included the gore that our friend Clayton from ""Cell"" endured, making us mortified of the antagonist's next step. It was even more exciting than Ben's run thru Co-Op city. Coupled with the chemistry between Jerome and Hodges, it was memorable and their banter added levity. King gets you invested in the characters in a different way than we are used to in his novels.  With that said, I do have my critiques of the story. However it was nice to see King step out of his normal genre with Mr. Mercedes. I tend to enjoy when authors do this."
stephenking,35pztb,brandscaping,1 point,Tue May 12 23:16:06 2015 UTC,"The Stand was my introduction to the post-apocalyptic world, and I still measure everything against it. The Road, Swan Song, Lucifer's Hammer, and even World War Z - all great, but it's the Stand I keep thinking of.   I'm agnostic but love the religious overtones. The character development is excellent, the dialogue is good, and the premise is believable. 'ish. (shameless plug - but I wrote a crude homage to it a few years ago)  While I'm not thrilled with how the Dark Tower series ended, I loved the journey, especially Wizards and Glass. Currently re-listening to the audible version, and I'm looking forward to spending some quality time with these old friends."
stephenking,35qrgg,guitarpwner,6,Tue May 12 19:06:15 2015 UTC,Looks like you've read enough to know about the universe that connects King's works. I'd say you'd be set for at least the first three Dark Tower novels or so.

stephenking,35rvgp,Jalcala,10,Wed May 13 00:10:48 2015 UTC,"I hope I'm misunderstanding you, because you sound like an ass. It is a fictional story. In this story, his characters use the power of good (God), to attempt to defeat the power of evil (devil, or R. Flagg). You don't have to change or question your religious beliefs to enjoy a story."
stephenking,35rvgp,RobertPaulsen39,2,Wed May 13 00:32:47 2015 UTC,"I'm a lifelong atheist (with a couple of degrees in religion) and King fan. The Stand is one of my favorite books of any genre, and one of his best works IMO. I found the religious themes to be...OK I guess, not enough to bother me or detract from the book. After all, there are lots of religious people in the world and writing a book on this scale or topic in which none of the characters are religious wouldn't make sense.   That said, I get what OP is saying: I detest religious fiction and there's nothing I hate more than starting a book only to find part way through that it's a work of ""Christian fiction."" That happens sometimes with Kindle books, or things you might grab at the library or a thirft store-- mysteries in which the main characters suddely start praying or whatever. Not for me. King's work is never like that-- his use of religious themes is modest and I think entirely in keeping with the tone of his larger body of work."
stephenking,35rvgp,SnowblindAlbino,0,Wed May 13 02:46:40 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I agree with you. I was worried this might turn religious."
stephenking,35rvgp,Deweyrob2,2,Wed May 13 13:58:34 2015 UTC,"I can understand why you may feel that way, and I might feel the same way if it were written as simply as that. But it's not. There will be some things that may seem to be pro Christianity, but they are really deeper than that. It's not a story about how you should be a Christian, since that's what you're asking. If that's all you're seeing, maybe you aren't seeing the whole picture for some reason."
stephenking,35rvgp,_420CakeDay,1 point,Wed May 13 00:32:48 2015 UTC,Never read the book but watched it on TV. Reglious themes but not Christianity outright. If you wanted to find them you could even find some of the tenants in the cycle of the werewolf.

stephenking,35im7w,talkingwires,1 point,Sun May 10 21:41:33 2015 UTC,"You'll be fine. King wrote the Dark Tower series over a period of thirty years. Characters, settings, and themes pop up in his other works, but it's not like you have to read them like you're studying for a test. The related books stand on their own, and anything important to the series is covered within the series.  Hell, King even addresses this in the Dark Tower series itself. A character is given a copy of one of King's books because it might be important, and he throws it away because he doesn't trust it."
stephenking,35im7w,glibrar,1 point,Mon May 11 00:27:19 2015 UTC,"That's great. ""It"" is one of his masterworks, and you should come back and post here what you think of the ending.

I would argue that it's better to augment the core books with the others if you think you are going to stick with King for the long haul."

stephenking,35im7w,jotaesethegeek,1 point,Sun May 10 20:08:50 2015 UTC,I have posted my thoughts on the dark tower and gotten a lot of positive response on it so here goes  The book The Wind Through the Keyhole is a DT book came out dead last after TDT was supposedly finished but is supposed to be read as book 4.5 (between 4 and 5) however...  If you haven't read The Dark Tower before then I suggest you read Wind Through the Keyhole last. If you are on a re-read of TDT then read Wind at book 4.5 like it should be. The reason is that by the end of book three all the major players are there and healthy. Then Wizard and Glass takes you away from what you know to be the main story. Reading yet another book right after WaG that has nothing to do with the main story might make a person lose interest. Though good WaG was huge and add in Wind and you get a LOT of pages that aren't dealing with the main ka-tet. On a re-read this will not be a problem  Release order for the rest of Kings works is fine... make sure you get an unabridged/uncut version of The Stand  IMHO of course
stephenking,35hkci,TheJessicaProblem,12,Sun May 10 13:05:11 2015 UTC,"My interpretation was that it was written that way to show that Amelia Jenks is poor and uneducated.

stephenking,35ft6o,WeAreAllYellow,1 point,Sun May 10 02:31:08 2015 UTC,It's great to have that background on The Father but as far as Salem's lot goes he didn't have a huge role to play. It was an important role very important even but not a big role as far as that book is concerned. Also what he did in that book has very little to do with The Dark Tower other than telling you how he arrived at the place in his life that allowed him to be who he was in TDT. You don't NEED to read it but if you do you will probably be very happy that you did.   I would read it first  Also if you haven't read The Dark Tower before then read Wind Through the Keyhole last. If you are on a re-read of TDT then read Wind at book 4.5 like it should be. The reason is that by the end of book three all the major players are there and healthy.

King's book tours are always right after he comes out with a new book, and the next book doesn't come out for a month. Many of the events he does, he doesn't have a meet-and-greet type signing. Usually, he has copies of the new book that he has signed before the event and there is lottery to get one of those books with everyone who has a ticket to the event.   Even if you were to find a signing where he is personally signing each individual book in front of you, he usually only signs the book that he is touring for.   I've pm'd you a link to a signed copy for sale that appears to be legitimate and is a pretty good deal."

stephenking,35d9bm,chillbill69,1 point,Sat May 9 17:07:21 2015 UTC,"Your chances of getting an older book signed by Stephen King are somewhere in the same ballpark as being struck by lightning twice.  He only signs the latest release at his book signings (I expect the next one will be in June with the release of Finders Keepers) and even then you have to be extremely lucky to get a signed copy.  To go along with that he will not sign it to your friend, just doesn't have the time to personalize a copy.   Long story short, you are asking for the impossible. You should have got in touch with him before he announced that he was retiring (some 20 years ago) and before he got hit by a van and maybe you would have had better luck with getting an autograph."

The first book is notorious for being a bit of a hard entry to the series, but if you enjoy the second book you should enjoy the rest.

After we saw him and his son speak, we were waiting outside around the corner for our ride, we were all excited to have been able to be in the same room as him and hear him read an excerpt of his book. As we were standing there babbling about how awesome the whole experience was, a door opened right near us. In our excitement we weren't paying attention to who was coming out and my dad said ""that was the most incredible experience of my life, I can die a happy man now and its all because I have the best daughter.""  I was about to say something when the person walking out stopped and asked us where we had just come from. It was Him! My father explained how he came to be there and how meeting The Stephen King was our lifelong dream and just talking uncontrollably. I was speechless until he shook my father's hand and gave me a hug. He thanked us for being loyal fans and just made my father's wish come true in every way. He actually stood and made small talk with us for a few minutes even though his car was waiting, and so did his son. He was amazing. So friendly and down to earth. Like talking to an old friend. He signed our books, then when he was leaving, hugged us both and told my father that the best legacy a parent can leave behind is a child who can carry on their interests after they're gone.   It was wonderful. He was amazing and my father will cherish that night for the rest of his life, as will I."

My experience was the total opposite. I only read the first novella so far, but ""1922"" is the finest work I've ever read from Stephen King. The language is refined, devoid of any sloppy quirks, loaded with unique aphorisms and quotable passages, and well-paced. The story is layered with enough symbolic depth for critics like Zizek to have a field-day with, and touches on some interesting ethical questions, somehow without being pretentious too. I believe a work like this belongs in every creative writing class. The last time I loved a Gothic piece this much was Toni Morrison's Beloved.   I've read a lot of King, and I was really swept away with this one. Almost afraid to start Lisey's Story any time soon."

I adore 1922 and most of Full Dark No Stars. King's usual format is quite long though, often to his discredit as he gets carried away quite a bit. It was nice to read his more succinct stories and I definitely appreciated them.   His longer books are great in my opinion but can get bogged down here and there. Lisey's Story was the richest I've read emotionally considering the length and depth of the story."
stephenking,3577bg,iiRenity,10,Thu May 7 17:58:58 2015 UTC,"I read Wind after reading the whole series twice, so it was definitely a nostalgia trip for me. You could stop and finish the rest of the series, but like you said, you're halfway finished. Also without giving anything away, shit is gonna get real with the next book, and you can use this as a breathing point before charging head first into the rest of the series."
stephenking,3577bg,notyetretro,5,Thu May 7 18:30:05 2015 UTC,That's why i've always recommended people read it at the end.
stephenking,3577bg,docwilson,5,Thu May 7 19:18:45 2015 UTC,Since you're already halfway through I would say finish it. But if you just can't stand it skip to the next. There's no fun in reading something you don't want to. The book is a way to revisit old characters and I don't think I'd be able to read it after wizard. Have fun with the journey.
stephenking,3577bg,wizzzrd,5,Thu May 7 18:23:38 2015 UTC,"I would skip it for now if you're not enjoying it; save it and relish it when you've finished the series.  It's great to revisit Midworld and the Ka-Tet, but story-wise, they're just sitting around a fire listening to Roland tell a story-in-a-story, neither of which really answers or addresses anything you're going to be interested in while in the middle of their quest.  You might be worried that you'll find it too slow next time, too, but by then you'll want to go back and hang out with them around a camp-fire, trust me."
stephenking,3577bg,city17_dweller,3,Thu May 7 20:24:57 2015 UTC,Thanks everyone for the response. I think I am going to go ahead and put it back down for now. Everything I keep hearing suggests that it's meant to be some sort of nostalgic read for afterwards. D= Which makes me dearly suspect some serious shit is about to happen in the next book.
stephenking,3577bg,Reinmaker,2,Thu May 7 20:41:01 2015 UTC,"It's not a long book, so you could power through it. But I would think it would mean more to you once you've finished the rest of the series."
stephenking,3577bg,invol713,2,Thu May 7 19:37:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, The Skinman story kinda did lag for me, but the Tiger story was great. I read it as 4.5 whenever I read the series, but I've read all of it many times before, so that may help me along."
stephenking,3577bg,Brendan42,2,Thu May 7 22:31:25 2015 UTC,I feel like reading it in between Wizard and Wolves completely kills the flow of the story. Wizard is already a 700 page flashback and Keyhole is more of the same. (It also doesn't help that it's just not that good.)  I'd skip it and go back to it at the end.
stephenking,3577bg,wolfehr,1 point,Thu May 7 23:35:27 2015 UTC,"I adored Wizard and Glass, it's actually my favorite DT novel at the moment, but Keyhole just seems out of place at the moment. Like, I understand that was where it took place timeline wise, but it doesn't feel like I'm properly appreciating it because I think it's meant as a nostalgic go-back for the reader. The writing style and tone just kind of suggest that to me, not to mention all the comments I've been hearing seem to agree. It is technically 4.5 but it does not feel like 4.5."

The way he's  described and the scene where he kills his baby brother had a big impact on me. It's one of the most memorable scenes in the book for me. He's creepier than Pennywise for me.

He uses it to make you hate the villain, its very effective. But its not overly explicit, not like you'd see him do with a human victim.   I'm tenderhearted about animals, too, though, and it wasn't enough to keep me from reading everything he's written."

Their meeting is good, but things aren't great for the animals in the zoo. A good one from the POV of the dog, Kojack (Big Steve), defending himself from a pack of wolves. The wolves are presumably under the direction of the Walking Dude, so not really animal cruelty (and spoiler)  If you get the unabridged version, there's a scene with more wolves attacking a character, and I think in both versions they mention how it turns out.  They talk a bit about how it's the domesticated animals (horses and dogs) that are affected by the flu, while the rest of the animals are ok. There are some scenes about eating rabbits, and some hunting.    Also - just remember that it's fiction. If you don't like the scene, turn the page.  No animals were harmed in the making of this post."

It was the face of a hatefully happy man, a face that radiated a horrible handsome warmth. . .""  Maybe I haven't seen Cumberbatch in the right things, but the guy stands out too much. Flagg should look like someone familiar, but only in the sense that you have a lingering feeling you've seen him before--maybe at a store, or maybe in a bad dream. His face shouldn't be recognizable, it shouldn't be unique. Cumberbatch has a very unique handsomeness to him. Nothing against the guy, but I'd always be aware that it would be Benedict Cumberbatch as Randall Flagg, not Randall Flagg.   Flagg needs to be played by a talented unknown. It needs to be someone who will completely melt into the role, because he's so iconic that anything that might distract from the actual character would be a disservice to the character.  I actually like your suggestion of the guy from The Guest. I had to look him up, but he has the right look for the part. If he can act it, he would be a good choice. Not recognizable, handsome, but not so handsome that he would stand out. Good idea!"

Also Kitt Harrington is waaaay tooslender to be Cuthbert,  Who was considered plump,on top of being 10 years too old. I think Oy would be better served by an ""unknown"" voice actor and CG.  Serkis is the undisputed go to for mo-cap,  but Oy is canine in nature, do it totally CG or put a mo-cap suit on a well trained dog.  It would be a better result and we wouldn't have to worry about Mr. Serkis marring the memory of Oy( who is one of my favorite supporting characters of all time)"
stephenking,353ec6,shimmycat,1 point,Wed May 6 23:30:03 2015 UTC,"I guess the trouble is that age-wise, sure, they're all young - but mentally, they all struck me as pretty adult, making adult decisions.  I like to think Oy is a big raccoon sort of thing with longer legs."
stephenking,353ec6,boomboom68,1 point,Fri May 8 02:15:31 2015 UTC,"They are extremely mature and trained for their age.  However,  it changes the story completely if you age them into their 20's.  The only reason they weren't immediately seen as a threat was their age.  Also,  the only reason they were sent east was their age.  Their fathers thought they were too young and wanted to keep them out of harms way... Otherwise you have a clunky story,  where intelligent rulers send prime soldiers away to an area where no one has a lick of sense and the Big Coffin Hunters would have to become complete oafs to underestimate them.  The only reason any of it works is youth.  The only reason Under the Dome worked as a story was because they were stuck under the dome.  Although the show lost its way early on,  it lost all traction when the residents could freely go back and forth.  When will producers and directors realize that you can't tweak parts of a intricate story without completely changing it.  Tl;dr:  youth is the only thread that keeps the Mejis story line remotely believable and suspenseful.  If you pull it,  the story becomes hackneyed and unbelievable..."
stephenking,353ec6,Odious_Maximus,2,Tue May 12 19:02:10 2015 UTC,How 'bout Bill Nighy as The Crimson King? That's kinda who I always imagined when I read the series.

stephenking,35316s,1015192122,2,Thu May 7 01:07:04 2015 UTC,I had such high hopes going into it. My first Stephen King book was 11/22/63 and I was expecting that style of writing. I was very wrong.
stephenking,35316s,TheDanimal438,2,Thu May 7 03:59:26 2015 UTC,"Tommyknockers had a terrible ending for sure. The remaining townsfolk just get hunted down by the government and that's pretty much the end of it. And let's not forget one of the protagonists rushing off into the stars, never to be seen again.

Don't pay any attention to the show. Cell is an easy read, but I found it not very enthralling. Just After Sunset is very dark, but it's really good. Hearts in Atlantis is good also, but it doesn't have a lot of supernatural stuff aside from the first story, and the first story in that book touches on the Dark Tower story. Dr Sleep is the sequel to The Shining, so I would save that one till after the first book."
stephenking,34xo5a,Deweyrob2,4,Tue May 5 12:54:22 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  On that list, Under the Dome is the best place to start.  Though overall, none of those are an ideal first King novel."
stephenking,34xo5a,SpookyGeek,5,Tue May 5 14:21:19 2015 UTC,Cell is quite easily digestible for a first-time reader. I would go with that one!
stephenking,34xo5a,gallantgeekery,2,Tue May 5 15:40:06 2015 UTC,"That's not the best selection of King books to choose from, but I don't agree with others saying Under the Dome as that's one of his more disappointing books. Out of those I'd go with Just After Sunset as it's a short story collection and will give you a taste of the different kinds of tales he can tell. After that I'd head to your local used book store and pick up some of his older titles are that are considered classics."

Under the Dome is a huge undertaking that is part mystery, part thriller with some ""humans are the real evil"" horror elements.    Doctor Sleep is a sequel to The Shining, though it's not necessary to read The Shining first, the end won't make as much sense.    Cell is a straight up horror novel, basically like a zombie apocalypse book.  Of the five, this is probably the ""quickest"" read.    Just After Sunset is a short story collection."

So his judgement carries weight. All of these people clamoring for Tim Curry should realize that 1. He is much too old for the role these days 2. He was the ONLY depiction of Pennywise, so duh he's going to be ""the only one"" for you. I won't deny he did great, by 90s tv standards. This is 2015 and this Pennywise needs to be brutal as well as devious. Most of you have not read the book, where IT has multiple incarnations, not just the clown. I was hoping for an ""unknown"" and I got it. He's got all the freedom to make the role his. Plus, remember the big stink about another clown a few years back? Oh Jack Nicholson is the only Joker I want. Nope. Now everyone sees Heath Ledger as the Joker."

Even though a few stages of the story rely on this flicking back and forth I do think that they could pull it off and I think this'll give the film(s) their own identity set apart from the TV movie and book.
stephenking,34xb7s,lemonloafer,1 point,Tue May 5 10:16:13 2015 UTC,I would prefer it be like in the novel. Have both climaxes at the end like King did. I feel like most movies would have it cut like kids-part 1 and adults-part 2. I think it would be more creative and challenging to transfer the back and forth into film.
stephenking,34xb7s,Banana2022,1 point,Tue May 5 19:10:14 2015 UTC,I think it would be more creative and challenging   Those are not necessarily related.
stephenking,34xb7s,Kozemp,1 point,Tue May 5 19:22:55 2015 UTC,"Didn't say they were. but I think most directors would choose to separate it to have two climaxes and almost make it like two entirely separate films, the second almost acting as a sequel.   I think it would be more unique, film wise, to do it together. I think it would be the creative AND more challenging choice."

It's a common rule of thumb to not write in first person, unless you've found a unique voice for that character.  Mr. Edgecombe's voice was wholly his own, not immediately recognizable as King's.

I was wondering the same question due to all of the references within the Dark Tower series to his other works.  I have a good friend who is an insane King fan and I asked him for his advice.  His advice was to read all of the books in chronological order and save the Dark Tower series until the end.
stephenking,34vqdc,shtaffa,1 point,Tue May 5 11:15:10 2015 UTC,I had the same question as OP - did your friend have a justification for this?? I'd be worried that references being made to the series when it was ongoing would be lost on me if I waited till the end to read DT.
stephenking,34vqdc,BigTrophyBoss,1 point,Wed May 6 00:56:18 2015 UTC,"As I understood it, there are references in later non-Tower books that refer to earlier books and vice versa.  He thought it made more sense to save them for last so all of the references to all of his other works would make sense.    I understand though it may cause some of those references to be forgotten.  That will probably be my case as well.  Regardless of this, I want to read the Tower series in one swoop, with nothing else being read between the books."
stephenking,34vqdc,shtaffa,1 point,Wed May 6 03:03:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, makes sense! I may commit to doing it the other way, knowing I was missing references would bug me too much."

I am about halfway through (just finished THE MIST) and would recommend doing it this way because while you are reading all of these great books The Dark Tower is always at the back of your mind helping to shape the way your experience the story. I feel like I am getting more out of the books than I would have otherwise. No matter what I am reading I know that Roland is out there waiting for me to catch up and it makes me, as the reader, feel more grounded to my own quest for the Tower.  I hope you enjoy the books and have as much fun as I am not matter which path you take in reading them."

stephenking,34rj30,butter_wizard,14,Sun May 3 23:04:40 2015 UTC,"It's kinda like Eddies thought process while he's running and panicky. The lack of punctuation makes it tense to read, which draws the reader in.  Same with the parts where  (He does)  This, if you know what I mean.

stephenking,34rj30,TheFullMonty1394,9,Mon May 4 02:23:23 2015 UTC,"SK does this all the time and I love it...he does the narrative as if it's the point of view of the character he's talking about...another example of this in ""It"" is in the beginning when they are talking about the confrontation between Adrian Mellon and Webby Garton: ""At this point Webby Garton decided he was going to rearrange the faggot's face. In the geography of Mellon's face, mountains would rise and continents would drift. Nobody suggested he sucked the root. Nobody."" The narrative refers to him as a faggot because that is Webby's point of view also the ""nobody suggested he sucked the root."" The narrator doesn't use that phrase the character does...but there it is in the narrative...same with this sentence Eddie was scared and panicked and that was how his train of thought was running"
stephenking,34rj30,pakap,4,Mon May 4 03:09:44 2015 UTC,"It is supposed to capture the feeling of panic, it was intentional. Reference I don't know, but it was written that way to portray confusion, urgency, and the horror that grips the town. It is a very interesting technique reallly."

stephenking,34rj30,incisorcist,2,Mon May 4 14:39:05 2015 UTC,it's from the kids perspective. It's the non-stop speech with no pauses for breath that an excited kid might use when he's telling a friend or maybe a parent about what they've seen/done. It's just a neat little way of getting the kids perspective across as well as showing that people are getting paranoid as the murders continue.

It wasn't a bad book and was an easy read, but aside from a few connections I didn't really feel like it was a sequel to The Shining. I thought it started out good with the ghosts, but I didn't like how it then jumped way forward to Dan as an adult alcoholic and that he had lost touch with Dick and didn't even know if he was alive or dead when he ultimately tried to reach out to him again.  I also never felt like the main characters of the story were ever truly in much danger from the True Knot and the ending with Jack Torrance's ghost making the save and waving goodbye to Dan was a little silly. Certainly not one of his worse books, but nowhere near one of his better ones."

I never felt that the good guys were ever in any real danger from that travelling band of psychic RV folks with silly names. They were just so easily defeated. Add the fact that the book only had the briefest, vaguest connections to The Shining. Overall I was disappointed. I enjoyed reading it, it wasn't bad, but it fell flat nonetheless."
stephenking,34qe1a,1015192122,3,Wed May 6 17:03:05 2015 UTC,"I loved Doctor Sleep. I loved the beginning, where the ghosts would haunt Dan. It was written very well and it helped me grow with the characters. I did like the true knot, even if they were relatively harmless, and I loved how Danny killed the true knot with fucking cancer. My favorite part of the book.  I didn't like some of Danny's personality, and I mean later on in the novel. I wish there would have been more where he was a piece of wasted flesh at the beginning. I wanted to see the ghosts more. I understand some of that was in the beginning, but I wish Bathtub lady would have appeared more in the book.   It was very well written and completely unecessary, but it was a good read and I will most certainly re-read it when I reread The SHining. ps. I haven't read The Stand yet but I have read Mr. Mercedes. FInished it this morning and I must say his writing is aging well. My new list:   It The SHining Mr. Mercedes Duma Key Revival   I wass so surprised to see so many new books when I tallied up the scores I gave them, but it was welcome.

stephenking,34qe1a,TheFullMonty1394,4,Sun May 3 17:45:37 2015 UTC,Shining was an organic story that focused on the relatable and personal relationship between a boy and his father. Dr. Sleep was a plot heavy cash in. Its like it was written by two different people.
stephenking,34qe1a,steelicarus,7,Sun May 3 18:52:16 2015 UTC,"Well in a sense it was written by two people. One was written by drunk off his ass ~30 year old Stephen King and one was written by sober ~60 year old Stephen King.  Also, I'm surprised by the suggestion that Dr. Sleep was a ""cash in."" Maybe I'm naive but I feel like King has made it clear a number of times that he only writes for the love of writing. And it's not like he's in a tough spot financially. I highly doubt that a writer as celebrated and as popular as King still is really has to rely much on the bankability of a novel he wrote nearly 40 years ago."
stephenking,34qe1a,no_capes,1 point,Mon May 4 01:20:12 2015 UTC,"TBH a lot of his latest stuff has seemed like a cash in. Or 'calling it in' if you like that better.  Mr Mercedes was stereo-typically very hackneyed, Revival was a mess, Under the Dome was boring and Dr. Sleep was clunky.  You'll notice that I've read them all and will continue to read everything he writes but the edge and fire and 'heart' that his earlier books (Firestarter, It, The Shining, Rose Madder, Drawing of the Three) seems missing.  I continue to give him the benefit of the doubt and already have his next two books on pre-order but I don't understand the change."
stephenking,34qe1a,steelicarus,2,Mon May 4 04:43:42 2015 UTC,"Why did you think Revival was a mess, out of interest?"
stephenking,34qe1a,BritishHobo,2,Mon May 4 21:26:52 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed the book overall, but I thought the ending to Doctor Sleep was a little contrived. Some of the outcomes of the main characters were not what I expected either. That isn't a good thing in this case, since Doctor Sleep is generally a much more upbeat book than was The Shining.   On the other hand, The Shining was an exploration of the monster that drinking can turn a person into (among other things). Doctor Sleep is about recognizing what drinking can do to you and drawing on help to prevent the monstrous outcome that befell Jack. The two compliment each other well, even if I am less fond of the sequel."
stephenking,34qe1a,LepNdaHood,2,Sun May 3 17:45:30 2015 UTC,"I actually also read Doctor Sleep directly after The Shining, and I was frankly disappointed for several reasons. The Shining is my favorite fiction by Stephen King (as a writer very inspired by King, On Writing is always my favorite book by him), and I don't think widening the scope of the story worked very well. The Overlook Hotel was cramped, and that worked well. But even more than that, the character progressions in the sequel were far less interesting. Jack's continual battle against addiction and the hotel was brilliant, maddening in the best kind of way. Doctor Sleep is a book much less suspenseful and far more akin to The Stand. As that's a huge fan favorite, maybe that sounds like a good thing, but The Stand does it a lot better than Doctor Sleep. But then, perhaps I just expected too much out of it and wanted it to be too much like The Shining."
stephenking,34qe1a,Macievelli,3,Sun May 3 17:45:32 2015 UTC,"I, too, am a writer (well aspiring) influenced heavily by King. The Shining and On Writing are my bibles at this point, and I must say that no matter how good Doctor Sleep was, it would never live up to the standard that The Shinning set. The novel is incredible, it mad eme feel for the characters more than any movie or game or tv show or book. I cried when Jack finally snapped. He was so close, so damn close to beating the addiction and it just overtook him. King really captured the deepest, blackest sadness with that book and it will always outshine the sequel because of that fact."
stephenking,34qe1a,TheFullMonty1394,1 point,Sun May 3 17:53:02 2015 UTC,"I suppose I should also say I'm an aspiring writer. I'm currently working on my first full novel, though I've written several short stories and some poems. For me, weaving together a cohesive story with good pacing and exciting moments has always come naturally, but Stephen King has really helped teach me about character progression, being interesting outside of the events, and the tone of the narration.  If I ever make it big, you'll know it's me by the occasional subtle King reference (for example, minor characters named Alain and Flag, because I love The Dark Tower too)."
stephenking,34qe1a,Macievelli,1 point,Sun May 3 19:21:00 2015 UTC,"Congrats on the novel, it's the hardest part of writing. I have an 1/8th finished but I haven't picked it up in months. I showed my friends a preview and, what I feel is an extremely promising prospect, was ridiculed into submission. Still working on getting the confidence back up to attack that one.  As for skills, I'm best at writing characters  and scary sequences. Cohesive storyline...well, I'm working on that, and King is helping with it very much. It's like i have all of the characters and concepts and terrifying sequences in my mind but no story line to tie them together sometimes."
stephenking,34qe1a,TheFullMonty1394,1 point,Sun May 3 19:34:04 2015 UTC,"That's rough! But good for you! King says in On Writing that the most important things to do to become a good writer is to read a lot and write a lot, and I've definitely found that to be true. My goal is simply to write every day. I miss some days. My goal is one page each day, but I often get up to about 1,000 words or more. Once you get on a roll, it's much easier. My advice is to never fully finish a thought before stopping writing. Always give yourself a starting point for your next day."
stephenking,34qe1a,Macievelli,2,Sun May 3 20:07:28 2015 UTC,"All of the above, but also never pre-write (to an extent). I have tried it many times and it results in burnout. On the other hand, if stuck you can simply write out the bullet points of a scene on a sticky note and it helps eons. When school isn't in session I can do around 4,000 words before I start to get weary. On good days, when the wind blows just right and the stars align, I can do 10k. and on bad days I max at around 200. It all varies."
stephenking,34qe1a,TheFullMonty1394,3,Sun May 3 20:19:25 2015 UTC,My biggest issue was that it never felt like the protagonists were in any real danger.

The plot outside of ""Danny goes to AA"" was rather thin, and the characters were one-dimensional.    Compare to his other recent works: 11/22/63 had an awesome plot; the character development in Lisey's Story was spectacular; the villains from Duma Key were terrifying.  Dr. Sleep just didn't have any of the above. It wasn't terrible but was otherwise very forgettable."

stephenking,34qe1a,teneno,1 point,Thu May 7 22:18:21 2015 UTC,"I recently read  both The Shining and Dr. Sleep. The Shining was absolutely brilliant, impressively brilliant. No matter how I feel about SK's later writing, it's beyond easy to tell why he became who he is in the writing world when you read stuff like The Shining.  I liked Doctor Sleep, but my expectations for his new stuff is a little low. Part of why I liked it is part of why I liked The Shining, all the mind reading, telepathy, precognition stuff. That's always going to be really interesting to me. I also liked Dan's relationship with Abba, their psychic conversations were really funny and cute. But I could have completely done without the True Knot storyline, and it kind of bothers me that the actual ""Dr. Sleep"" part of the story (Dan working at the hospice and talking to dying patients) really had nothing to do with anything. It was pretty inconsequential and seems a little weird that the entire book was marketed on that idea, when it wasn't all that relevant to the plot.   I liked it more than Mr. Mercedes at any rate. I get that SK isn't teaching us any lessons or offering any insights with his writing, but MM felt particularly meaningless."

stephenking,34qunq,argleblather,4,Mon May 4 15:56:20 2015 UTC,"""Duma Key"" is, in my opinion, one of the best audiobooks ever recorded. As close to perfect as is possible. Stephen Webber's version of ""IT"" is great as well. Most Stephen King novels narrated by Stephen King himself I initially found mediocre. When I discovered it was the author narrating them it made more sense, and I appreciated the fact that he wanted to narrate them. If nothing else he puts the intended emphasis on the correct words.    ""Stationary Bike"" is a short story King himself has commented on as loving the narrator. I do as well. ""N."" is another one with some great narration (a few different narrators).    Frank Muller did narrate a lot of King's work and he's not bad but some novels need someone else. Like I said, John Slattery narrating ""Duma Key"" is as perfect as I can imagine a narration can be. ""Joyland"" is also narrated very well.  Off the top of my head some other novels of his narrated well would include ""The Tommyknockers"", ""The Stand"", ""The Green Mile"", ""Black House"", ""Cell"", ""11/22/63"", ""Revival"", and ""In the Tall Grass""."
stephenking,34qunq,im_not_a_writer,3,Mon May 4 18:06:08 2015 UTC,"I started off reading his works. They were some of the first audiobooks I picked up with my audible account when I got one because I knew I'd enjoy them. It does bring a new dimension to the stories. I think the only one I didn't like as much was the narration of Cujo, but it's a good enough book that it carries itself well regardless. If you have a chance, listen to NOS4A2 by Joe Hill, he talks about audiobooks at the end of it. At the end of Bag of Bones King talks about the virtues of audiobooks as well, how they bring another dimension to a story."
stephenking,34qunq,AManHasSpoken,3,Mon May 4 02:29:00 2015 UTC,"I like reading more, it gives me the ability to use my imagination on voice, which shapes up characters so differently than any other voice can portray.   With that said, I love SK audiobooks because I don't always have time to sit and read and whenever I'm driving or jogging or mowing the lawn, I've got an audio book on.   I love listening to his short stories in audiobooks. His short story collections are great, and audiobooks that are well done give them a new dimension that can really draw you into it."
stephenking,34qunq,Modest_Cake,3,Mon May 4 03:48:25 2015 UTC,"Audiobooks is actually how I got into SK to start with. PC Gamer came with an audio version of The Gunslinger (on a CD, of all things!) which I listened to over the course of a vacation. I can't recall anything specific about the audiobook itself, but it must've been alluring enough; I've been into SK ever since."

Peter Straub: By this time, my wife and I had moved back to America, and when we were ready to begin, Steve drove from Maine to my house in Westport, Connecticut, to start the actual writing. He stayed maybe four days, during which we wrote the first fifteen or tweny pages, taking turns at my word processor. Then he went back to Maine, and I spent ten days writing up a seventy-page, single-spaced outline based on everything we had discussed. After that, he continued from where we had left off, transmitted his pages to me, and I picked up from his last sentence. We went on like this for about a year and a half, each of us firing off hundred-page, hundred-and-fifty-page segements at intervals of a month or so. When we were nearing the end, my wife and I went back to Maine, and Steve and I wrote the last fifty or so pages at his house, taking turns sitting down before his machine.  Not long after submission, our editor joined us at Steve's place, and we went through the book, making whatever cuts and changes seemed necessary."

stephenking,34f501,Hello_Cup,1 point,Thu Apr 30 19:26:30 2015 UTC,"Fukanaga is a great choice for director. His work on True Detective is superb, if not for the beauty of the camera work alone. Sure the acting in the miniseries was hammy and the terror reduced to a toothless bite, but what was expected? It was a network television miniseries in 1990. There's no way that they could have captured the full scope of the book with all those censorships in place. Casting was an issue, but I think it held up alright.  The casting of Pennywise this time around is critical. If they cast some goof like Jim Carrey or Johnny Depp such and such I think Ill take a pass, but Fukanaga seems like hes got the right ideas for this. If King gave him his blessing Ill give him mine too.... for now."

There is no such thing as a first edition book club edition. They are merely Book club edition books. The reason they aren't worth more money is because the ""true"" first editions had a limited print run while book club editions have a larger print run that's why there are so many out there.

I usually check both Amazon and eBay and see where the cheapest is and then compare back and forth for awhile til I find one in my price range but in decent condition.

stephenking,34c0gx,Nichase,10,Wed Apr 29 23:01:26 2015 UTC,That's a much better ending than him being worshipped as a diety on a Captain Trips free island. Now if this thing would just into development already.

Yet even though many of the stories took place decades apart they all had one thing in common... Every single story included a strange passing mention of a clown. They mention it like it was strange that a clown was there, but say nothing more about it like it's not weird enough or relevant enough to care."

stephenking,34291j,citizenpuppet,8,Mon Apr 27 19:04:55 2015 UTC,"I think the idea was that it was capital-G God saving people from themselves.  Remember this was written in the mid-1970s, pretty much the height of the cold war.  EVERYBODY--even me, and I was like 7--was wondering if humanity was getting ready to blow ourselves up.  I suspect King made a conscious decision to stay away from nuclear doom, because at the time fucking everybody was doing nuclear doom.  Even so, to my mind the consequences of human douchebaggery as amplified by technology were the core of the story.  At the end Randall Flagg, asshole, is undone by his own nuclear ambitions.  And in the process capital-G god gives the rest of us some breathing room to chill the fuck out and think about what we're doing.  To me it made perfect sense, but I'm a cold war baby.  HTH"
stephenking,34291j,extra_magic_tacos,5,Mon Apr 27 22:21:51 2015 UTC,I feel like it was a classic Flagg ending. He spins these complex schemes and expects everyone to stay on the reservation and do like he wants. When they don't he has no backup plan.
stephenking,34291j,cweis,5,Mon Apr 27 20:32:07 2015 UTC,"I honestly feel that the ending is very misinterpreted. That, or my interpretation of it is very wrong.  The entire manifestation of 'the hand of God' that sprang from Flagg is not literal. It is a metaphoric symbol for fate. The entire novel is based on fate, and it is no coincidence that 'the hand of God' is a phrase used to show destiny. I believe that the ending was meant to be anticlimactic, as it was just another act of fate that caused the journey to begin in the first place.  This theory of mine is not completely unsupported. The final phrases in both the abridged and unabridged versions reflect this idea of fate. The abridged version has Fran and Stu discussing whether the human race can learn from its mistakes, and the final line uttered in the book is 'I don't know'. This ambiguous ending shows that what comes next is in the hands of fate.  The Abridged version also contains an ambiguous ending, but ends it with a quote that hints to the motive behind the anticlimactic nuclear explosion in Vegas. “Life was such a wheel that no man could stand upon it for long. And it always, at the end, came round to the same place again"". Again, what happens in history isn't up to man, but to fate- the same fate that makes man commit the same errors over and over again."
stephenking,34291j,hixpwarior3,2,Tue Apr 28 00:32:38 2015 UTC,"That, or my interpretation of it is very wrong.   No one's interpretation is ever wrong. What you take away from a novel is special to you and you only. If it differs from someone else's ideas that's only because no two people are ever the same. Rejoice in your differences. Also I like you ideas on the ending. Fate and 'I don't know' brought to mind a thought... no one left alive at the end ever saw the 'hand of god'. I think that adds a lot of depth to the last line 'I don't know'.    No one left alive in the book 'knows' anything about fate or god... and neither do we."
stephenking,34291j,Damien__,10,Tue Apr 28 00:54:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, seriously? He spent 900-something pages building up only to have a hand come out of a cloud and end it all? I felt like I'd been ripped off by that. Of course, I've never thought he was very good at ending his novels."
stephenking,34291j,spacebrew,2,Mon Apr 27 19:56:23 2015 UTC,I can say the same thing about Salem's Lot. All that build up and the end was like 40 pages. It happened so fast. I'm really frustrated with how he ends his books.
stephenking,34291j,VolcaProblem,2,Wed Apr 29 15:34:06 2015 UTC,"I've never thought he was very good at ending his novels.   Never. He just runs out of steam and punts much of the time. I've been reading King since c. 1980 and by about 1986 had decided I'd be happier if I just stopped about 25 pages before the end and made up my own ending. But I don't, and I keep being disappointed by about 85% of them. Painful to hit the end of the Dark Tower series that way..."
stephenking,34291j,SnowblindAlbino,5,Tue Apr 28 03:12:06 2015 UTC,"Let me start by saying that it's been over 20 years since I've read the Stand. That said, it remains one of my top three SK books, alongside The Shining and It.   I agree with you wholeheartedly, and I'd even go a step further by saying that the book goes from a polished sci fi classic in the first half (oh my god, that chapter that ends with a dark movie theater and one person coughing...fantastic) to a strange plot mess in the second half. I know King was going for a good vs evil showdown at the end, but I think the first half of the book is what shines the most."
stephenking,34291j,borkborkbork99,3,Mon Apr 27 19:36:18 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Some of the second half works really well (ex. Trashy/The Kid), but most of it just seems so forced."
stephenking,34291j,JitteryPenguin,3,Mon Apr 27 19:43:31 2015 UTC,a strange plot mess in the second half.   I think that happened because he introduced so many characters and was really trying too hard to have them meet / organize organically instead of just glossing over that and making it happen.
stephenking,34291j,JitteryPenguin,2,Tue Apr 28 02:29:47 2015 UTC,"Do you think we'll ever see a sequel?   I'm not sure. I didn't think we'd see a sequel to the shining, but we have one now.   The Stand is considered by many to be his greatest achievement, so I'm not sure that a lot of fans would want a sequel. I would, however, settle for 300 pages or so about what happened afterward."
stephenking,34291j,thariq,2,Tue Apr 28 02:33:34 2015 UTC,"If you've read The Dark Towere series you must know that Stephen Kings vision of literature (maybe even life) is that it's all about the path, not the destination. He wants to tell a story and we all go and have a great timing reading it, or not. I thought it was a great book and, personally, loved the ending.  On the other hand, Randall Flagg is much more than it looks like in the book, which you can know more after reading The Dark Tower, which includes a very tiny but interesting bit of The Stand's story. I'd strongly advise reading it."
stephenking,34291j,ChronoTravis85,2,Tue Apr 28 08:07:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think the idea was that creating a civilization was itself a bad thing, but that they let it take priority over their divine mission to defeat Flagg. Also, Flagg was defeated, just not destroyed. He did survive to try some evil machination in some other time and place, but for the plague survivors of Boulder, they had won the day and could live on for a while at least. I don't think the book lends itself to a full sequel, but King has stated recently that he has plans to write a short story about two of the characters, set after the end of the book."
stephenking,34291j,mustloveclogs,1 point,Thu Apr 30 21:00:05 2015 UTC,"To me, the real magic of The Stand was the character development and how much I want to revisit them again in the future. The plot matters less to me."

stephenking,341v4e,LaggyToast,3,Tue Apr 28 02:34:29 2015 UTC,"This book is AWESOME. More than worth the read. There are so many story lines that all slowly poke towards each other in these intricate and bizarre ways. You get all caught up in one story line, and just when things start getting really whacked, he switches to another thread long enough to get you interested & keep you from wanting to put it down.  There are sooooo many fucked up things that people do to each other, King has always had a great talent for letting his fictional characters go to some dark, but still ultimately human (human, not humane) places. He has always been able to show you just how good and bad things can be at once and this book is one of his best examples of that.  Once you've read it you'll have plenty to think/talk about for a while. This is a book that'll stick with you a bit anyway, whether you want it to or not"

I picked it up as part of a bundle of other King books and it has the combination of being a big book and generally regarded as one of his worst. Rose Madder gets a bad rap, but I have no interest in reading that anyway, so if anyone has anything good to say about Dreamcatcher, that would be great."

Dreamcatcher is honestly one of my favourite books though, and I think it's worth finishing.

I didn't find it bad, per se, but it's not my favorite."

The Sun Dog. I feel like this story caught my attention because of how King picked out a seemingly normal, everyday object, a Polaroid camera in this case, and turned it into a portal to something terrifying. It's stories like these, that take place in a reality so close to ours that you can imagine it happening to someone you know, or even worse, yourself, that make me love King.  It's stories like these that keep me thinking awake at night"

stephenking,341v4e,cheezy8,2,Tue Apr 28 04:27:33 2015 UTC,"Four Past Midnight is solid gold.  The first story, The Langoliers, is one of King's weirdest and scariest novellas.  I absolutely love it.  I didn't hate Secret Door, Secret Window despite wanting to because of the general shittiness of the movie version.  But it's the Library Policemen and The Sun Dog that make this one a must read."

stephenking,341v4e,homie_dude_guy_man,2,Wed Apr 29 04:32:42 2015 UTC,I got about 150 pages into The Gunslinger and just couldn't do it anymore. Is it worth fighting through the last of this book to read the others in the Dark Tower Series?
stephenking,341v4e,Nichase,7,Tue Apr 28 02:35:08 2015 UTC,"Please, please finish the first book & read the first 30-50 pages of the second!  I felt the exact same way you did when I first started The Gunslinger. I thought it was boring, dry, too artsy, too wordy. Basically a poor attempt at a first novel with high hopes and low ability. HOWEVER I powered through it, and the payoff as you start the second book & meet Edward Cantor Dean on a deserted beach on the edge of the sea, makes every doubt & question you have about the series go up in smoke.  This series starts off rough, but truly truly is an epic. I knew by the first major event in the second book that I would finish the entire series. Since then I've read it a dozen times & listened to it on audio book a couple times. Each time I listen/read through it I discover more depth. I have a few friends who are Dark Tower Junkies like myself and we sometimes get together for beers & DT talk.   This series made me think differently about life.  Finish The Gunslinger, and I'd but 2 bucks on you finishing the rest of the series. And then probably rereading The Gunslinger ;)"
stephenking,341v4e,ReginaldVelveeta,2,Tue Apr 28 02:51:44 2015 UTC,"I just read the Gunslinger, I believe it was the revised version, which King himself stated that he toned down the unnecessary ""wordy"" bits, and I assume made it a bit easier to get through for the reader. It took me about a week to read it, and it got a bit dry about halfway through up until the final chapters, but that was not too many pages. I don't think it will prove too difficult to read it again, sometimes as you come back to books you find more enjoyment out of them anyways.  I am picking up the next book from the library in a couple of weeks and cannot wait."
stephenking,341v4e,SpookyGeek,2,Tue Apr 28 03:58:07 2015 UTC,I really want to read the Talisman. I got to the point where he was working with those guys on Earth but then my Nook broke.

stephenking,341v4e,MercurialForce,2,Tue Apr 28 02:42:22 2015 UTC,"Ok, here's the thing about that.  King sucks at ending stories.  Period. The thing to remember, though, is that King tells amazing stories.   The Dark Tower is easily King's best story, as he puts it, it's the story that all other stories come from. This series is really a series that you must read one page at a time, without worrying about where it will go, or what may happen to the characters.   You will wonder about the characters, and where the story will go, but just ride it out, you'll be impressed, amazed, brought to tears, laugh like a loon, and in the end you'll have made friends. (Friends with the characters)   It may not be everything we want from a series, but it's Kings best work & it's honestly made me think differently about life in general.  I always recommend this series & I think I always will"

A few of his books have anti-climaxes, but the vast majority have strong endings that fit what came before.  The Dark Tower only gets better towards the end, and the final ending of the series is probably the best he's ever written."
stephenking,341v4e,Jatsala,2,Tue Apr 28 18:49:12 2015 UTC,"I guess you're right on that, thinking back to the endings I haven't liked, it's really been just that... I didn't like them. Not that they weren't good, or didn't fit, I just think I wanted something else to happen.  So it's probably more me being selfish than poor quality writing"
stephenking,341v4e,Wtayjay,1 point,Wed Apr 29 15:34:49 2015 UTC,"Which is fine. One of the reasons I am such a fan of King is that he writes the ending for the story, not for the audience.  The Dark Tower VII, The Colorado Kid, and From a Buick 8 all are good examples if you want to read more on his philosophy toward endings."
stephenking,341v4e,Jatsala,3,Wed Apr 29 15:46:57 2015 UTC,"I love The Colorado Kid. One of my favorite stories of his. It's so intriguing!   Plus, whoever read it for audio book really nailed the Maine accent pretty well. Being from Maine myself, I appreciated that."

I'd gotten used to a his writing falling into a kind of pattern where it's really slow at first, then there's a looooong build up, then BAM action. This one was fairly action packed all the way through & the characters seemed very real to me, very relate-able.   The villain in this story is one of my faves too. Great example of how evil grows & becomes too big for itself to contain.    If you can get it, the audiobook version of this was a fantastic listen, I don't recall who narrated it, but I remember really liking the way they did the story"

If you already like some of his work then you have nothing to lose by reading something of his that you haven't.  Ignore whatever critics or other fans think are good or bad and make up your own mind. I know sometimes I end up loving things that people hate and hating things that people love. No one's perfect. Some stories are better than others, but for me the fun is going on that journey and finding it our for myself."

It was like they didn't think the movie going public could handle Stephen King's version of the story, so they had to make a happy(ier?) ending.

I know they had issues making the miniseries for IT since it's basically about child murder. But since this is a new century, maybe things are different enough where this won't be an issue anymore.

King has written a lot of stories both short and long, so of course there are bound to be some bad endings in there. Overall though I think his bad endings are a minority not a majority of his works.  As a long time Constant Reader the only criticisms that I think are valid are that a lot of the time he warns you that something is going to happen before it happens and he also tends to use the same expressions over and over. ""Audible click"", ""arc-sodiums"" etc."

stephenking,33xlk4,iTouchedLemmy,11,Mon Apr 27 15:24:17 2015 UTC,"(Ahem, spoilers abound because this is a discussion of endings.)  Well, Pet Sematary had his best ending in my opinion, and the short stories probably don't count but I do think he has an issue with endings. It didn't bug me when I first started reading his works, or even while I was really in the moment of the story, but it was the kind of thing that would always bother me afterwards when I really started thinking about what happened.  I think part of the issue for me is that he tends to have his everyman main characters prevail against some infinite cosmic evil without so much as a training montage, and he does it all the time. Like ""It"" and Needful Things would be my case in point in your particular list, because they're both basically ""main characters beat supernatural villains with the power of imagination or just because they author said so,"" which just doesn't work for me after a while. I mean, Sheriff Pangborn pulls out some paper flowers and that's enough to run this guy off? It's just unsatisfying. The Stand, as well, (which I loved) also had the problem where it seemed like the main characters won because God suddenly decided they won, and not really because of the characters actions. While it sort of made sense in context, I also found it unsatisfying. I tend to give that sort of thing a pass on my first read through but not my second.  But that's why I liked Pet Sematary's ending. Regular guy goes against cosmic monstrosity and gets stomped. No author pulling conditions for victory out of his bum, everything that happened was earned."
stephenking,33xlk4,Vixlari,1 point,Sun Apr 26 19:48:17 2015 UTC,"(spoilers - still discussing the ending of a book)  I disagree with your view of The Stand. The ending of the Stand was that RF was back, just reincarnated somewhere else. Basically that he won even though the good guys ""won"". It is unsettling because the cycle continues and is terrifying because at the end you realize evil can never be destroyed, it just takes on a new form. A bad guy that can't be killed is really the scariest possible type of villain. Yeah god stopped that one specific instance of nuclear death, but even god could not kill RF forever."
stephenking,33xlk4,InsanePancake,2,Sun Apr 26 22:14:33 2015 UTC,"Well I suppose there haven't really been too many books where characters defeat the ultimate concept of evil forever, but I'd argue this particular battle of good vs. evil was won with an extremely liberal dose of deux ex machina and I loved it a bit less for that."

Maybe objectively it isn't so bad, I just felt like he tried to finish the book quickly and lost the pace and atmosphere (I think I liked how the main guy and little girls story finished).

stephenking,33xlk4,theshallowdrowned,3,Mon Apr 27 02:50:22 2015 UTC,"One of the reasons I'm a fan of King's work is because he isn't perfect. I like reading his stories and then analyzing them to find the good and the bad. Usually it's his endings that I point out as being sub-par, or even downright terrible.   SPOILERS AHEAD!!!  I think he sometimes suffers from a bit of writer's block. As though he had a sudden burst of genius and came up with the basic plot and characters, then when he was putting it all together he realized he never dreamed up an ending, so he just pulls one out of his ass.  His work also suffers from over-escalation of the plot. Like in IT where the story is about a supernatural entity which takes the form of a clown and kills children, but instead of making the clown a ghost of a child murderer and explaining the creepy backstory involved King decides the clown should be an inter-dimensional antagonist from before time. As though things weren't weird enough already.  Or in CELL which I think is one of my favorites of his, where King explains the basic plot is that everyone's gone insane due to some frequency sent through their cell phones and the sane survivors have to live in a world turned upside down. As if that weren't enough King also throws in the fact that the ""phone crazies"" are also psychic and capable of mind control and telekinesis. King often seems unable to keep psychics out of his work.  King can also have a problem with rambling on and on about things which have no direct relation to the plot. Things which should have been mentioned and then not explained simply because they were unnecessary, or because the side story could be better used as fodder for a new short story connected to the King universe.  I recently read REVIVAL in which King writes about the life of a young boy who grows up to become a troubled teenager and then eventually an adult man who reunites with his old mentor for a Frankenstein-esque experiment in which they bring someone back from the dead (complete with all the cliches typically found in Lazarus plots) and end up connecting with a Lovecraftian dimension. This sounds okay, except that King spends 4/5 of the book simply explaining the experiences of the main character as he grows up and deals with drugs, alcohol, and woman troubles. I realize that we need some character development moments in order to like the main character and feel tied to him once the danger begins, but it shouldn't take 4/5 of the story to create that connection. And if the only real excitement shows up at the very end of a long drawn out coming of age story then it's kind of a let down. Am I reading a horror novel or a coming of age story? Because the book was marketed as being horror yet the horror doesn't show up till the last few pages. Yet the book reads like a coming of age story yet the end is so out of place and totally irrelevant to the coming of age plot line.  One thing I like about King is that he has learned over the years that sometimes his work isn't that good and sometimes other creative minds do is work better than even he could have. King has admitted that Frank Darabount made a better ending to THE MIST than even he could have. I personally think the theatrical adaptation of 1408 is much better than the short story. Only with Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of THE SHINING would I state that the theatrical adaptation is not any good and gets way more credit than it's due."

Others have given me some bedtime creeps, but I recall actually being frightened while reading this book.  I don't remember a whole lot of it, but I recall the main character having some extremely unnerving visions. Those were what freaked me out."

stephenking,33zzd4,chillbill69,2,Mon Apr 27 05:15:13 2015 UTC,King has only been in 12 of his movies (including tv miniseries).  There are well over 100 movies and tv miniseries made based on his books. I'd say that is far from all of them.

I think Defoe would be okay but I feel like maybe it needs to be someone less well known or someone who is more able to melt into the part the way Tim Curry had. Defoe would be distracting because I would see him as himself playing Pennywise versus just seeing Pennywise.

stephenking,33na3m,justpicksomethin,7,Thu Apr 23 22:54:25 2015 UTC,"Wizard and glass is probably my least favorite book in the series but saying it's my least favorite book is like saying that it's the worst bite of a piece of cake. My problem is the same problem I had with something like LOST, the flashback stuff is interesting but The most interesting stuff is happening in the present time"
stephenking,33na3m,phantom827,3,Fri Apr 24 00:30:15 2015 UTC,"I heard that about Wizard and Glass, too! I think much of it has to do with the fact that many of the first Constant Reader's were left hanging for a few years, only to find that the book wasn't progressing the main Ka-tet's quest for the Tower. I absolutely adored the book. I'm reading the Dark Tower comic book, The Gunslinger Born now. I've been debating whether to move straight to Wind Through the Keyhole next, or to take a break for now."
stephenking,33na3m,justpicksomethin,3,Fri Apr 24 00:04:52 2015 UTC,"I read The Eyes of the Dragon between. It's short and ties into DT somewhere if i read correctly.

stephenking,33na3m,Jatsala,2,Fri Apr 24 00:32:44 2015 UTC,"I was worried when i started Wizard and Glass because many DT readers said it was their least favorite.   I loved it. I saved it to read last, because about 1/2 way through I knew I'd want something after it was all over. It was a great, nostalgic, semi-romantic look back at Roland that I treated like an after-dinner mint, savored for a long time. (Or not so long, as I actually read the entire series over Christmas break a few years ago, after setting aside book one the year it was first published...)"
stephenking,33na3m,masaoshigeta,5,Fri Apr 24 04:37:06 2015 UTC,"I love WaG, and every time I reread it I still tear up a little. It's so damn good, King really outdid himself with that book."
stephenking,33na3m,cavaliereternally,2,Fri Apr 24 06:07:39 2015 UTC,"I find it interesting how King said he struggles with romance stories. In the afterward, it was the main reason, he said, that he put the book on hold for so long. I thought it was beautifully written. Maybe a little quick to develop, but still beautifully written."
stephenking,33na3m,masaoshigeta,1 point,Fri Apr 24 13:47:37 2015 UTC,"Isn't that how 14-year old love IS though?

stephenking,33na3m,beandip24,0,Fri Apr 24 13:46:44 2015 UTC,"He didn't HINT at anything - you know from The Gunslinger that Susan didn't turn out well, and from Roland's reticence concerning telling the story."
stephenking,33na3m,Phifty2,3,Sat Apr 25 23:11:27 2015 UTC,"I knew that they wouldn't have a happy ending together, since Roland is obviously on his quest to the Tower alone until he meets the current ka-tet. However, I thought that King may have her removed from the story in other forms other than death. Maybe as a character that reappears later on or something."
stephenking,33na3m,peacemomma,2,Sun Apr 26 00:58:05 2015 UTC,That's a good point! I kind of took it as a given that she would die so it took on a deeply Shakespearean tone timbre for me.

You should see 625 Madison Avenue on both.  2 Look for the words ""First Published in 1982"" on the copyright page  3 Look for the issue price of $16.95 on the dustjacket  4    The book size should be 9.5h x 6.25w (this is the same size as many 1st ed SK books published in the 80's, just slightly taller then the all the 1st edition dark tower books)  5    Boards should be blue in color, quarter bound in dark blue/navy"

stephenking,33mr0m,scaryketchup,2,Sat Apr 25 04:00:19 2015 UTC,should either say first edition on copyright page or have a 1 as the first number on the number line (I honestly don't remember which verification they used for that book)
stephenking,33mr0m,avsfan1933,2,Thu Apr 23 20:46:15 2015 UTC,I found a similar edition of the shining at a thrift store. It was so faded the text is essentially unreadable and the only reason it caught my eye was because I thought the faded danny head had something to do with Orwell. Very glad I found it.

And of course, ""when you're fucking with me, you're fucking with the best"" is the old timey equivalent of ""come at the king, you best not miss"". Honestly I'm surprised The Dark Half hasn't been properly adapted yet. I'm sure there's atleast one adaptation out there but I'm talking about a real one. Hopefully the trends are shifting in a positive way now to the point where stuff like this can land as a mini-series on Netflix and bring a lesser known character like George Stark out from the shadows, turn him into something iconic.  As for the article itself, the woman's right. The procedure really needs to be incorporated on a larger scale if it's really that effective."

I loved ""Popsy"", and ""My Pretty Pony"" is one of the most beautiful stories I think he's written.  Actually, I could kind of do a mini book report on each story. They were each, in their own way, extremely captivating. Some are gross, some are freaky, some are just stories. But none of them are just stories. I don't know exactly how to put it, other than, with his short stories, you get all of the ambiance of a King novel, but in a much more compact package. It's a medium I wish he'd work with more.  Have you read any of his other short story collections? They all kick ass"

stephenking,33hfc1,veganchaos,5,Wed Apr 22 17:58:01 2015 UTC,"Most of the best stories have been mentioned, but I found ""It Grows on You"" to be haunting, with one of King's most poetic first paragraphs:   New England autumn and the thin soil now shows in patches through the ragweed and goldenrod, waiting for snow still four weeks distant. The culverts are clogged with leaves, the sky has gone a perpetual gray, and cornstalks stand in leaning rows like soldiers who have found some fantastic way to die on their feet. Pumpkins, sagging inward now with soft-rot, are piled against crepuscular sheds, smelling like the breath of old women. There is no heat and no cold at this time of year, only pallid air, which is never still, beating through the bare fields under white skies where birds fly south in chevron shapes. That wind blows dust up from the soft shoulders of back roads in dancing dervishes, parts the played-out fields as a comb parts hair, and sniffs its way into junked cars up on blocks in back yards."

Prior to this I'd say I'd read at least 20 of his books, mostly as a teen in the 90s.  From July of last year until now I've been reading nothing but King, thanks largely to my pledge to read The Dark Tower in its entirety including tangentially related works.  From their I just decided fuck it, do it all.  Even the ones I had already done.  As of today I am halfway through Everything's Eventual (second time reading it) and only have Just Before Sunset remaining.  It's been a long slog with ups and downs and copious similarities between books, but on balance I'd say his goods are so good that they overcome the mediocre to bad works.    Except for Faithful, fuck that.  Blockade Billy and the two baseball stories in Nightmares and Dreamscapes were enough of that"

It is so far from the book at this point it's mind blowing.  Last time a movie strayed from the original by this much (Lawnmower Man) King had his name removed from the whole movie.

King talked about the environmental and religious undertones, and the allegory of how the government dealt with 9/11. Fantastic.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_the_Dome_%28novel%29#Environmental_and_political_undertones  Hated the show at first. I think it had so much potential but then lost it. But when I gave up on the show ""matching"" the book, I started to enjoy it again. For a while I went into every episode wondering how they were going to fuck it up this time. It got better, though--or else my expectations got so low it didn't matter. Either way, I'm actually looking forward to it returning."

Environmental and political undertones of article  Under the Dome %28novel%29:       Regarding the theme of Under the Dome, King said:      From the very beginning, I saw it as a chance to write about the serious ecological problems that we face in the world today. The fact is we all live under the dome. We have this little blue world that we've all seen from outer space, and it appears like that's about all there is. It's a natural allegorical situation, without whamming the reader over the head with it. I don't like books where everything stands for everything else. It works with Animal Farm: You can be a child and read it as a story about animals, but when you're older, you realize it's about communism, capitalism, fascism. That's the genius of Orwell. But I love the idea about isolating these people, addressing the questions that we face. We're a blue planet in a corner of the galaxy, and for all the satellites and probes and Hubble pictures, we haven't seen evidence of anyone else. There's nothing like ours. We have to conclude we're on our own, and we have to deal with it. We're under the dome. All of us.     Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

They are all interconnected.   There is a major character that you need to meet. He figures heavily in one of the novellas, but he also influences some of the things that happen in the other novella and two of the short stories. (Debateable, but yeah) This character is important in the last short story, with another tie-in to the dark tower. (It is not a necessary tie-in, but more of an ""a-ha"" moment when you achieve resolution with that character.)  So short answer? Read it. Low Men in Yellow Coats, the first novella is a must. Read the rest, because they're good, and connected to LMIYC. Read the last short story for what appears to be a mystery, that later is resolved in the DT series.   But, that's just, like, my opinion, man."

stephenking,33655f,Jayviar,3,Mon Apr 20 00:35:10 2015 UTC,Yeah I do think a large chunk of the first half could be removed without hurting the quality of the story. I think King said himself that Insomnia is an example of him trying to hard and basically padding it out.

stephenking,33655f,RisingRapture,2,Mon Apr 20 02:36:50 2015 UTC,"I am the exact opposite.   I thought the first half of the novel was brilliant. An almost perfect illustration of a descent into madness -- or at least, it could be. That's the beauty, you don't know if he's going crazy or not. I was actually convinced that this was going to be my new favorite King book.   And then I got to the halfway point, and it stopped being a descent into madness and became a story about elderly superheroes trying to stop the next Unabomber. Not that I dislike superheroes, but it was such an unexpected shift and not at all what I wanted out of the second half of that book.  Granted, it has been a while since I've read it. I've been wanting to revisit it and see if my opinion changes. But that's my first impression."
stephenking,33655f,ughalready,2,Mon Apr 20 07:59:56 2015 UTC,"I'm pro-Insomnia. It explains The Dark Tower structure of King's universe probably better than many other of his books. I'm talking about this scene where Ralph meets one of these doctors on the hospital roof, I think."

stephenking,332gmm,no_capes,3,Sat Apr 18 21:55:29 2015 UTC,"I would say...  The Long Walk  Thinner  Running Man  Road Work  Rage  I don't feel like any really stand out as being particularly bad, Rage is so much hype because it's harder to find."
stephenking,332gmm,I-am-so_S-M-R-T,3,Sat Apr 18 23:11:06 2015 UTC,"I would put The Long Walk first, it's a simple straight forward story without a lot of surprises to shake it up. It's basically what it says on the tin  Running Man would be next. Also a pretty straight forward story  Thinner falls in the middle, not great. honestly more of a King book than a Bachman book. This is what finally gave him away. But it gets points for the ending  Rage is fourth, just because there is a make out part which Bachman describes her white cotton panties that made me a very happy 13 year old.  And finally we come to Roadwork, it's last simply because it left a very small impression on me, I can hardly remember what happens.  Now if we include Blaze in the list, it is at the top. I can't say enough good things about it. The audiobook played on endless repeat in my car for a year, until I got the Lisey's Story audiobook.  I don't count The Regulators as a Bachman book. It's a King book, plain and simple. Not saying it's not good. I liked it the best of the Tak books. It's just not a Bachman book, Under the Dome is closer to a Bachman book than it.  Ok there are my three cents"
stephenking,332gmm,Masurai1987,2,Sun Apr 19 05:27:00 2015 UTC,I'm very happy to hear your kind words about Blaze! I have never read it and I never see it talked about so I always assumed it was one of those forgotten books from King's slump period.  Much more excited to read it now!
stephenking,332gmm,jl45,2,Sun Apr 19 14:48:31 2015 UTC,"If anyone asks me what my favourite king book is my answer is always ""the long walk"" I can't rank the others though as haven't reAd any for a long long time. I too don't count the regulators as a Bachman book. Just the original set that forms the Bachman books"
stephenking,332gmm,longooglite,2,Sun Apr 19 06:09:26 2015 UTC,"I think Rage doesn't get the credit it deserves, it's my number one. I think that he very neatly explores the things that make people tick and what happens to normal people in abnormal situations.  The Long Walk is an excellent Sci Fi story.  I think that The Running Man played well with two fairly common tropes, the rampaging widower and the death games. It was enjoyable, but I don't read it over and over. I think the Long Walk did the death game better.  I must have read the others at some point, they didn't make an impression"
stephenking,332gmm,amaranthfae,2,Sun Apr 19 17:09:21 2015 UTC,"The Long Walk  The Regulators  The Running Man  Thinner  Rage  Roadwork  I LOVED The Long Walk, I felt emotionally drained (in a good way) after reading it.    The Running Man was dark and dystopian and I liked the ending a lot.    The Regulators was a thrilling read, very high tension.  It has some moments that stand out very clearly even years later, so that gives it some points.  Thinner was pretty good.  The main character was so unlikeable I was rooting for the gypsy curse, but it was still an enjoyable read.  Rage, well, felt forced to me.  Hype aside, given the content I felt kind of bored reading it.    Roadwork is hands down my least favorite work of Stephen King, ever.  I hated it.  The main character was stupid and selfish and disgusted me, and even the tragic backstory didn't make him any less so.  And I haven't read Blaze yet, so I can't really put it on the list."
stephenking,332gmm,RisingRapture,1 point,Sun Apr 19 17:34:39 2015 UTC,Rage   Haven't read the other ones yet. But I'm particularly interested in Running Man as I'm a big fan of the Arnold movie.

I love the whole part about the deadfall that you have to not think about in order to ascend.

stephenking,32r47u,MercurialForce,6,Thu Apr 16 01:12:28 2015 UTC,I loved the ending as well. Don't get the hate it receives sometimes. What a wonderful journey those books are.
stephenking,32r47u,tony42rivers,5,Thu Apr 16 01:14:25 2015 UTC,"I had occasional problems with the final book, but never with the ending. The ending was flawless, and perfect for Roland."
stephenking,32r47u,DeseretRain,2,Thu Apr 16 01:29:58 2015 UTC,"I really hated the ending. I mean, I was fine with Roland's quest repeating, there was no problem with that. But I really hated the part of the ending with Susannah. It made no sense to me why she just sort of randomly gave up on the quest when it was almost done. Like...I get that she needed to quit so she wouldn't get stuck in the loop, but in the actual moment there wasn't really a good explanation of why she was walking away, she seemed to just randomly give up.   And I REALLY hated how she went to live in that alternate dimension with fake versions of Eddie and Jake. I mean...those people aren't Eddie and Jake. I would think that the real Eddie and Jake are waiting for her at the clearing at the end of the path. And she's just hanging around with these other two people who have similar genetics, but totally different life experiences and personalities. It would be like if your husband died so you just married his twin brother and acted like it was the same thing.   Also I felt like the battles with both the last villains were really anticlimactic. They spent so much time building up Modred and then he just accidentally poisoned himself to death. And the battle with with Crimson King was just kind of silly, and the victory was mainly accomplished with the help of a character who joined the group last-minute and seemed more like a plot device than anything.   Also I didn't see why King needed to stop in the middle of the book right before the ending to write a personal note to his readers where he basically insults them and tells them they're going to hate the ending. That's just going to set people up not to like it."
stephenking,32r47u,BrassOrchid,1 point,Fri Apr 17 00:31:10 2015 UTC,"I understand the your feelings on all points, but here was my perspective:   I felt like Susannah's destiny was never to reach the tower, Roland had to make that journey alone and they both knew it. She had gone as far as was necessary and had had everything taken from her. I think SK loved her so much that she deserved to have happiness for once in her life. Furthermore, I feel the alternate versions of Eddie and Jake are not any less real and are connected via transcendent energy/the soul to the original versions. Even thought the Keystone version has died, they live on in other worlds and will eventually come back around the wheel in the Keystone world. And the fact that Jake and Eddie recognized her immediately lends to the idea that it was destiny (ka) for her to end up with them. The final encounters with the villains were definitely brief, but SK has said many times that when you strip Evil down to it's actual reality, it is really a weak and stupid force and easily defeated. And if you haven't, read Insomnia, it makes the introduction of The Artist make much more sense and seem more relevant. Lastly, I think he was honestly trying to stop people from reading on. There is no end in life except death, the ending of any story is a literary device, a choice of when to say ""The End."" I think the ending reflects his personal world-view that everything, all energy and experience, is a wheel, with no beginning or end, destined to repeat and repeat. There is no end, and he knew people would not want to hear that, or not understand it, and that's why he included the break in narrative.   Just my two cents."
stephenking,32r47u,DeseretRain,2,Fri Apr 17 14:46:17 2015 UTC,"So are you saying you think that all alternate versions of any specific person, in all dimensions, just have one soul that they share?"
stephenking,32r47u,BrassOrchid,1 point,Fri Apr 17 20:09:16 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. They're all different because of their circumstances, experiences and situations, but are fundamentally linked."
stephenking,32r47u,Kozemp,1 point,Fri Apr 17 21:15:54 2015 UTC,"I may be projecting some of my personal issues onto the quote-unquote controversy here, but I think maybe some of the distress people have with it is the very metafictional aspect of it.  I loved, really loved, the end of DT because in addition to showing how Roland's quest isn't really for the Tower but to redeem himself for the things he's done in the past, for me the Dark Tower is also a story that is about stories, and Roland's quest starting over in a slightly different way is a great dramatization of how stories are different every time you read them, and to each person who reads them.  So you have, on the one hand, a story that people have spent a long time with that isn't actually about what they thought it was about (aka Lost Syndrome), combined with a meta/philosophical notion that people may not have been expecting to have to confront. You're going to see some blowback.  I may not agree with people's reaction, but I can see where it comes from at least."
stephenking,32r47u,Saijar,1 point,Thu Apr 16 15:02:38 2015 UTC,"Same here. The ending was amazing, despite the fact that I was spoiled by accident here on this subreddit; not a direct spoiler, but I was pretty sure what was going to happen, but it didn't spoil a thing, if that makes any sense..... This is kind of weird, but I feel like my world view about life was changed after finishing the last three Tower books. I loved everything that everyone seems to hate about the last three books. The final books are where it gets strange, and where the quest of the tower really kicks off, and I loved every fucking word of the last three books."
stephenking,32r47u,foggy22,0,Thu Apr 16 16:31:54 2015 UTC,"In the moment I had a big problem with the end, but then later I thought about it from a different perspective.  It had been called (by him) his magnum opus, and then it's done, right?  Yet the ending is Roland going on.  So I always took it to be, SK had had this grand idea that this is my masterwork, and I'll never top that in terms of quality.  But no, that's not true.  Here he was years after he began TDT, and realizing a creative journey is never over, he can keep doing this forever.  He can keep creating great books until he dies.  That's what I took from it, I don't know if he's ever commented on that specifically, but that's my interpretation, so I love that ending now."

Personally, I loved the book and I feel its message is amazing. Maybe for people who have never been around that type of situation or haven't known people affected by domestic violence, it seems a little preachy or too direct or exaggerated. But for people who are living with it, or people who know people, there is true power in those pages.   Rose Madder and Dolores Claiborne are both more than just novels, they are empowering emblems of female strength. Cliche as they may seem, some women NEED to read these books to see their lives clearly. I truly believe SK has saved lives with these books."""

So much of this series does not make the transfer onto the screen effectively in my opinion. For example, I don't think I could take the climax of the blain situation at the beginning of wizard and glass seriously if I was watching it on screen. The reason it works in the book is because King lays out the emotion and anticipation for you."

stephenking,32onox,bird19,2,Wed Apr 15 16:18:30 2015 UTC,"It was stated that Preacher's Corner, the small town where Chapelwaite Manor was, was less than 2 miles from Jerusalem's Lot. So it could be possible that as Jerusalem's Lot grew Preacher's Corner was absorbed into the town."
stephenking,32onox,bird19,3,Wed Apr 15 17:25:31 2015 UTC,"Hmm... that's entirely possible.  Given the completely ""haunted"" nature of both Chapelwaite and the Marsten House, I'd say it's pretty likely they're the same."

It's the one I recommend to everyone who's thinking about getting into SK. And this is coming from someone who detests vampire stories and has a general distaste for Salem's Lot."

stephenking,32rhv6,NinjaloForever,1 point,Thu Apr 16 03:06:24 2015 UTC,"I wish I could help you, but The Shining didn't scare me, either.  My fears aren't readily expressed by media such as books or movies. Without getting into too much detail, Signs scares me because of one fear, and ""I Know What You Need"", found in SK's Night Shift scares me because of another. I've read a fair amount of Stephen King, and the only story of his that has ever scared me has been the aforementioned ""I Know What You Need"".  Then there's the occasional jump scare, which brings me to one more of the very few (I can count them one one hand) pieces of media that has ever scared me: Metroid II: Return of Samus."
stephenking,32rhv6,Seekerman,1 point,Thu Apr 16 03:56:49 2015 UTC,"I'd chalk it up to different strokes. The Shining didn't scare me necessarily, but I do regard it as one of his best. I think by the time I read it I had seen the Kubrick movie too many times for it to have a huge scare factor, that said, though, some of the scenes that weren't in the movie (the topiary animals scaring Danny at least) REALLY gave me the willies.  SK's books that really did a number on me:  Misery, The Stand, Needful Things, Thinner, and IT.  ..  Short stories: The Raft, The Moving Finger and The Mist.  ..  Honorable mention: The Tommyknockers (I love Lovecraft, and this is a good homage), and Cujo."

stephenking,32kh6z,DeseretRain,7,Tue Apr 14 19:53:55 2015 UTC,"Sure, that answer makes sense from within the SK Universe. My bigger question is, what does this say about Stephen King the person in real life? I see two possibilities:    In the mid 90s when writing W&G, Stephen King created the phrase ""Bool! The end!"" out of thin air as a nonsense phrase for Walter, the phrase stuck with SK, and a decade later when he wrote Lisey's Story he used it again when he needed another nonsense word, or ""Bool! The end!"" has some deeper significance to Stephen King, pre-dating his publication of W&G. It was convenient to use as a nonsense word for Walter. And then he used it on a much more personal level in Lisey’s Story. The phrase was deeply connected with Scott Landon’s inner demons … perhaps the phrase had real meaning to Stephen King, perhaps in a very similar way as it did to Scott Landon.    I don't know. I just find it very interesting that a nonsense phrase was used very  randomly and casually in W&G, then popped up again in a much more significant way a decade later. Makes me think the phrase means something to SK, and has for a long time."
stephenking,32kh6z,ironylaced,2,Tue Apr 14 20:14:19 2015 UTC,"Everything SK has said about Lisey's Storey leads me to believe that the novel has very close ties to his own experiences. How far that goes I don't know, but I think you may be on to something."
stephenking,32j5df,mustloveclogs,13,Tue Apr 14 05:14:52 2015 UTC,"Don't make the same mistake I did years ago and give up after this one. You have to get partway through Drawing of the Three before you can really have an opinion on whether the series is for you. The Gunslinger is nothing like the rest of the books; in tone, setting, etc. it's completely different."
stephenking,32j5df,toke81,3,Tue Apr 14 05:52:13 2015 UTC,"You're right, but I still loved it. I have read this one, and Wizard and Glass the most out of the whole series."
stephenking,32j5df,beandip24,1 point,Tue Apr 14 15:25:33 2015 UTC,"I am about 180 pages through Wizard and Glass and it has already become my official favorite book of the series. Gunslinger sucked on the first read, then on the second I thoroughly enjoyed it for some reason. Drawing of the Three was good, Wastelands was good. However, Wizard and Glass is like a non-stop page turner for me."
stephenking,32j5df,iiRenity,1 point,Tue Apr 14 19:52:25 2015 UTC,"The reason you enjoyed it the second time might be the reason I enjoyed it too. The Gunslinger was emotionless, empty, and dry. Everything about that book was like it was in black and white, just fairly bland. Until the end of the book where things started happening. Then you start learning about The Gunslinger, and you see him as more than just a killer with fast hands. Re-reading it after some other books, you know more about him and can sympathize with the situation a little more. At least that's my take on it.  But Wizard and Glass built the characters perfectly. And it's a stand alone book too, not relying on any of the other books to be great.  I have read those two books over and over lol"

That hits the nail on the head about how I felt about the book the first time around. However, I didn't read any of King's other books before returning to it. I wanted to proceed to the second one but felt I would forget key details, so I went ahead and reread the first before going on. Something just... clicked. I don't know. Ka."
stephenking,32j5df,iiRenity,2,Tue Apr 14 23:50:40 2015 UTC,"Agree 100%. I debated continuing the series after the first book, but now I'm nearly done with the fourth and am totally drawn in.

The producers wanted to get a cameo from King himself but he politely declined.
stephenking,32cvqc,redditalready77,3,Sun Apr 12 21:47:14 2015 UTC,"I figured it was cheap cheesy horror, is at least in the ""it's so bad it's good"" category? I would just rent it, but I can't find it anywhere. DVD is only $9... any chance it's worth a purchase for a huge king fan?"
stephenking,32cvqc,yt_nom,1 point,Sun Apr 12 22:37:42 2015 UTC,for 9 bucks... I'd just get it
stephenking,32cvqc,jolocus,3,Mon Apr 13 00:57:01 2015 UTC,Wow tbh this sounds awesome to me. I checked it out on letterboxd:   http://letterboxd.com/film/you-cant-kill-stephen-king/  Still bad ratings but it seems this movie is full of references to King and I gotta say I'm a fan of referencial movies.
stephenking,32cvqc,redditalready77,2,Sun Apr 12 21:16:52 2015 UTC,Yeah go get it.  It'll add to your collection if nothing else.
stephenking,32cvyz,IckGlokmah,8,Sun Apr 12 18:57:59 2015 UTC,"The Stand is a classic, but if you recently read The Shining and enjoyed it, I guess it would be cool to read Doctor Sleep while the kid version of Danny Torrance is fresh in your mind. You can always read The Stand afterward; that is allowed."
stephenking,32cvyz,HoraceDerwent,1 point,Sun Apr 12 19:12:01 2015 UTC,"It wasn't that recently though, I read it sometime last year. Should I still go for Doctor Sleep? Which one do you like more?"
stephenking,32cvyz,totallygeek,3,Sun Apr 12 19:21:27 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed The Stand more than I did Doctor Sleep. However, Doctor Sleep flows well, making it an easy book to digest in a short period of time. You could pick it up just about any time after reading The Shining, but I would do it before diving into a story as gripping and involved as The Stand."
stephenking,32cvyz,HoraceDerwent,1 point,Sun Apr 12 19:53:59 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed The Stand more, but that is because The Stand is probably his best book and is a modern classic, it's not because I don't like Doctor Sleep. People have different opinions (eg. I completely disagree with Brendan42 who thinks Thinner is SK's worst book) and you'll just need to read them to form your own.   As I said, there is nothing stopping you from reading both."

I just returned to King a year or so ago, and Holy Crap!!! He's a really great writer.   Anyhow, I read him very out of order, just whatever sounds good at the moment.

stephenking,329jo2,NotElizaHenry,1 point,Sun Apr 12 02:21:43 2015 UTC,"Seriously, this really saved the ending for me, all the baby shit with Stu/Frannie and the happy Boulder families  really put me off. Having Flagg reappear in an unknown time/place added a dark note that I appreciated.  King seems to be a pretty big fan of babies in general, for instance the final chapter of Dreamcatcher. I liked the actual ending of that book, but could've done without the gabbling infant."

stephenking,328z9s,mustloveclogs,6,Sat Apr 11 17:39:34 2015 UTC,"IT and The Stand are among my favorite SK novels, but you have to admit that King has a problem with the ending of some of his horror novels since he loves the ""go big or go home"" idea.  IT has the spider, The Stand has the hand of God, The Shining has an explosion.  You just have to chalk it up to SK being a great writer who occasionally doesn't know how to write an ending.  I've read someone else's comment that SK's novels take you on journeys so enjoy the ride.  Forget the end (if it stinks) and remember the good parts.  If I didn't have this thought process, I wouldn't be a King fan.  Go back and re-read IT, but when everyone's about to go in the sewer, close the book.  Let that be the end.  Let your imagination run with what might have happened if you wrote the book.  You'll have a deeper appreciation for the novel if you can separate a sub-par conclusion from an otherwise amazing book."
stephenking,328z9s,frostfromfire,6,Sat Apr 11 19:35:47 2015 UTC,"I've read someone else's comment that SK's novels take you on journeys so enjoy the ride.   That's not just community opinion, it's King's own words. He explicitly said in the narrative break in the seventh Dark Tower, I believe it was, that in an ideal world he would tell the story as far as he wanted to tell it and then would just stop writing. One sentence the story is going on as usual, then there's just a blank space at the end of the page. Endings, to him, are necessary evils of getting published that he wishes he could avoid altogether.  It's not that his endings are bad because he can't write them, it's that his endings are bad because he doesn't care to make them good."
stephenking,328z9s,SynysterSaint,-1,Sat Apr 11 21:11:02 2015 UTC,"In IT I was a little let down when the entity was from outer space, or another dimension, or whatever.

I'm not saying that the culmination King chose to go with (other dimensions) in IT isn't overdone, I just think the evil spirits are just as rote."
stephenking,328z9s,eggsaladbob,1 point,Sun Apr 12 01:20:34 2015 UTC,What do you have in mind (serious)? Outside of evil spirit or aliens there's not much else
stephenking,328z9s,not_caffeine_free,1 point,Sun Apr 12 18:36:55 2015 UTC,"Like frostfromfire said, I think King has a big problem with putting endings together. He definitely likes the all or nothing approach, at least in his longer novels like The Stand and IT. I think this stems from the fact that he writes as he goes, he doesn't necessarily have an outline of events to refer back to as he goes. His endings obviously suffer from this, but I also think this procedure of writing allows King to focus on his characterization. This backs up the point that his books are ""more about the journey.""   That said, I was surprisingly happy with IT's ending. I mean, you have to buy into his work a bit going into it, but knowing that you'll have to suspend your disbelief, I think everything came together pretty well, though I agree it was mostly out of nothing. Similarly, The Stand's ending came out of nothing, but it didn't take with me. Maybe this is because I was attached to The Stand's characters like I was with those in IT's."
stephenking,328z9s,eggsaladbob,1 point,Sun Apr 12 01:40:40 2015 UTC,"I'm reading my first novel of his, 11/22/63, and I'm really enjoying it. I really wanted to read IT first but could never find onto it. Is his newer stuff better?"
stephenking,328z9s,nuera_penal,1 point,Sun Apr 12 02:55:18 2015 UTC,"I definitely think IT could have been better, both the novel and the miniseries. That's one of the reasons I like King, he isn't perfect and it's fun to analyze his work and see what mistakes he may have made. I totally think the whole huge spider and giant inter-dimensional turtle thing was going too far. Although that's kind of what you have to expect from King long stories. He seems to lost track of what little realism he still has and goes off the deep end by the finale, maybe due to writer's block."

stephenking,324tpq,docwilson,3,Fri Apr 10 16:55:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks for answering. I just really liked King's approach to an alien invasion and I expected being incredibly bored reading it based on book reviews and things I have seen said about The Tommyknockers on this sub and I ate that book up and could hardly set it down and felt on the edge of my seat the entire time. The only time I was a little bored was when Gard was introduced and we had to learn all his back story and stuff while he was doing the poetry reading/party where he got drunk, and that was only because I expected Bobbi to be the ""main protagonist"" and I didn't understand the change of direction (despite the fact that I know this deep character development stuff is what king is great at)."

stephenking,324tpq,sudin,2,Fri Apr 10 18:05:34 2015 UTC,I feel the same exact way. It's funny you posted this today because I've been thinking about rereading the book recently. It's a sign! Haha
stephenking,324tpq,ChoiceD,2,Fri Apr 10 18:07:18 2015 UTC,"I wasn't expecting to hate it or anything--I have actually been saving this one because I was looking forward to it as I slowly run out of new King to read... (King writing about aliens, of course it is gonna be good! I thought to myself, so I saved it for a while). I wasn't expecting to love it SO much."
stephenking,324tpq,Giggity_1981,2,Fri Apr 10 18:09:14 2015 UTC,"I think the consensus is that it's too long and he should have trimmed out some of the unnecessary stuff.  Even Stephen King said something like ""There is a good novel in there somewhere.""  I disagree though, and I liked the flashbacks and tangents and the multiple parallel story lines. It's definitely one of my favorites by him."
stephenking,324tpq,goody2shoen,1 point,Fri Apr 10 19:30:37 2015 UTC,"I don't hate it, and I think it could have been a very good novel, but it does slog and meander."

I didn't expect to hate the book going into it, I love literally every word I have read of King, even the ""bad endings"" many like to talk about, so I just thought I would ask why so many seem to not really care for this hulking book when I was on the edge of my seat all 750 pages. Just trying to get some perspective as to what people didn't like about this book."
stephenking,324tpq,Phifty2,1 point,Fri Apr 10 17:56:06 2015 UTC,"I am currently listening to IT on audio book after reading it for the first time about a year or two ago, and I was pleasantly surprised (but not surprised at all being so close to Derry) that there were so many IT references in Tommyknockers. I wasn't expecting the two books I was reading (well, listening to IT) to work so well together to read them at the same time. I will have to get my hands on the audio book for the future."

Alas, I can't find anything on Google to support this claim."

stephenking,324puz,CrimsonKing1029,8,Fri Apr 10 15:46:56 2015 UTC,Definitely worth a read. Such a great journey to take.
stephenking,324puz,awag,6,Fri Apr 10 15:56:45 2015 UTC,"It is SO worth it, I am very envious of you being able to read it for the first time. Just accept that you're writing off a week of your life."
stephenking,324puz,TheHundredth_Idiot,5,Fri Apr 10 16:54:32 2015 UTC,"Read the original edit 1st, if you can find it. It's tighter. If you like it as much as you should, read the Author's cut in a couple years for the additional fleshing-out of the characters."
stephenking,324puz,LeoPelletier,2,Fri Apr 10 16:15:13 2015 UTC,I agree. The edited version is intimidating enough.
stephenking,324puz,Deweyrob2,4,Fri Apr 10 17:39:51 2015 UTC,I highly recommend this book. One of the characters in the book has become one of my all time favorite characters from any book. Here's looking at you east Texas.
stephenking,324puz,Batspank,3,Fri Apr 10 17:46:00 2015 UTC,"If you want to keep calling yourself a King fan, you gotta read the Stand. If you are a King fan, you will definitely enjoy the Stand. Will it be your favorite? Maybe not, but there's a good chance it might. I think overhyping and the length definitely hurt it, but it's a great novel. It is actually my favorite."
stephenking,324puz,CLCutting,2,Fri Apr 10 21:09:52 2015 UTC,"I found that it took some time to get into it. I'd pick it up and put it down thinking ""this book is too long/slow."" However, once all the characters were introduced (and there are a LOT of them), I found that I couldn't put it down. Amazing book. If you read it, read the uncut version (it's daunting - but in the end you'll be glad you did)."
stephenking,324puz,RatsInTheCellar,2,Fri Apr 10 16:04:07 2015 UTC,"I'm conflicted...I really liked a solid third of it, but once it was over I felt kinda cheated, like I went all this way with all these people...and it's over.  I listened to the uncut audiobook version, and I've heard from fans that I should have gone with the published version first, and check out the uncut later on if I were interested..."
stephenking,324puz,wotrednuloot,1 point,Fri Apr 10 16:38:50 2015 UTC,"The ending was abrupt and hashed together quickly for sure, but I think the uncut version was definitely the way to go."
stephenking,324puz,eggsaladbob,1 point,Sun Apr 12 01:53:39 2015 UTC,Really?  Maybe in 5 or 10 years I'll revisit it...but at the end of it all...I wasn't very pleased with it.    That said many fans I've talked to consider it one of his best novels...and it would be unfair not to mention how unique all those characters were
stephenking,324puz,wotrednuloot,2,Sun Apr 12 03:21:44 2015 UTC,"I liked it, but it was disappointing overall... Too much hype I suppose.   Also, DO NOT watch the miniseries (tv show)... It makes me not want to even think about the story. I have a hard time thinking of them separately now. Truly an awful show"
stephenking,324puz,Maximusplatypus,2,Fri Apr 10 18:03:05 2015 UTC,So good that not even last year's Ebola scare stopped /u/paradigmevo from finishing it.
stephenking,324puz,pbpsning,2,Fri Apr 10 19:47:25 2015 UTC,I found the timing perfect. The fact that the book is excellent also helps. Certainly one of Kings best.
stephenking,324puz,paradigmevo,1 point,Fri Apr 10 20:59:58 2015 UTC,"I must admit I enjoy that as I begin reading it now, the hospital lab workers are sharing a respiratory illness. Not as good as your timing though."
stephenking,324puz,pbpsning,2,Fri Apr 10 21:14:58 2015 UTC,"Basically, as a Stephen King fan you'd be doing yourself a huge disservice by skipping it over. The Dark Tower series may be Sai King's magnum opus, but The Stand is his greatest standalone novel, bar none."
stephenking,324puz,SkaFaceRudeboy,2,Fri Apr 10 15:53:32 2015 UTC,"'It' is my fav, is the stand better than that?"
stephenking,324puz,AManHasSpoken,3,Fri Apr 10 15:56:00 2015 UTC,"I would say that It, The Stand and 11/22/63 are his best for me, in no particular order."

stephenking,324puz,frostblooded,1 point,Sat Apr 11 16:57:00 2015 UTC,"They are... different. The Stand is on a much bigger scale. But it is great at showing the people who gather from whole America and how their lives change. And, as always, the little details are the best. As in most King novels, the characters are exquisite."
stephenking,324puz,eggsaladbob,1 point,Sat Apr 11 16:56:50 2015 UTC,"IT is also my favorite from King, and The Stand was a supreme disappointment for me. Without revealing anything, I just didn't enjoy the characters anywhere near how much I liked those in IT, and the ending of The Stand, like many of King's book, fell through. That said, I think The Stand is definitely worth the read, if only because so many consider it to be his best work. It has some great points for sure, and it's not a bad read, though it's probably about twice the length it needs to be. If you are a fan of King already, it's a good one to add to your repertoire. Just don't let the hype get to you. If you go into it thinking it's going to be the best of King's book you'll ever read, it's going to let you down."

The book he signs is always the newest release, haven't heard of him signing older books within the past few years (last four or five tours at least), because he doesn't want people selling them for the fast cash off of ebay.  That's not saying that it's impossible, just unlikely."

For shorter reads I would recommend Carrie (his first novel) and the novella ""The Body""."

stephenking,32093u,StephenTylerAustin,2,Sat Apr 11 19:34:35 2015 UTC,Night Shift. If you prefer a novel I'd suggest Pet Sematary (374 pages though).
stephenking,32093u,DanzigMeowMeow,2,Fri Apr 10 16:06:25 2015 UTC,"Personally, I loved Salem's Lot. Plenty of characters to live and hate, and a nice tie in to the Dark Tower if you decide to start the series."
stephenking,32093u,GalacticProfessor,4,Sat Apr 11 21:09:36 2015 UTC,"Eyes of the Dragon is a quick read and one of the easiest reads he has written, in my opinion.  The Gunslinger is a great start into the Dark Tower world (Eyes of the Dragon technically is, too, but peripherally).  One of the short story collections, like Skeleton Crew, Night Shift or Four Past Midnight also give a range of his story-telling abilities."

I recommend the Running Man, written under his pen name of Richard Bachman, or Cujo, simply because that one is classic old-school King.  If you decide to take on a longer book at some point, The Stand, It, and The Shining are generally considered his best.

stephenking,31zf04,ilukezzz,2,Thu Apr 9 10:26:03 2015 UTC,Maybe the part where the one kid rips out his own throat during his final burst of insanity. I would still suggest reading the entire book.
stephenking,31zf04,Mafuckma_Gandhi,2,Thu Apr 9 19:46:12 2015 UTC,A part that always stuck with me was when Scramm got sick. He was the favorite to win and probably would have won if not for the bad luck of getting pneumonia. Would he have won? Maybe you can talk about Stebbins and the way winning something like this comes from your will instead of your physicality. Why does Garraty have the will? Why doesn't Stebbins?  Or maybe Hank - who climbed up and grabbed that soldiers gun. They could have had a revolution. What might have happened had they all revolted right then? Would they have gotten the upper hand? And then what?

stephenking,31vmht,grummzing,2,Wed Apr 8 19:14:28 2015 UTC,"Reading It and The Stand back to back is a pretty hefty task, but both books are in my top 5 favorite books--and not just Stephen King books.  Concerning all the people warning you about reading the abridged version... just read it.  In a few years you WILL want to read it again.  Go for the Complete & Uncut for your second readthrough."
stephenking,31vmht,TheWildRover_,1 point,Wed Apr 8 21:20:44 2015 UTC,I am on my third read through - the uncut edition this time. It is better.

stephenking,31vmht,Spankler,3,Wed Apr 8 15:02:34 2015 UTC,"Loved it.  My first exposure to ""It"" was when I was about 7 or 8 when the mini series first aired(I actually just looked this up, apparently I was only 3 when it first aired - woops.  My mom is a big King fan, I'm sure she had them on VHS and I had watched them without her knowing then.. lol)  Scared the crap outta me.  I actually bought and watched it on DVD right as I started the book.  And as much as I do enjoy the TV series, it does display quite a different story.    I love both of ""It""s forms, the book and the movie.  The book gave so much more background to all the characters including It.  Honestly that was my favorite part of the book, the parts near the end with It's dialogue, where It becomes this entity that the TV series would never be able to really capture the way your imagination does.  I have high hopes for the new cinematic adaptation.  I for one love reading books of movies I've seen, or seeing movies of books I've read.  I love to see other peoples' interpretations and see how close or far away my own ideas of how certain scenes turned out or characters develop are from others'."
stephenking,31vmht,enderak,2,Wed Apr 8 15:58:15 2015 UTC,Do we have a clear date for when the new adaptation is coming out in theatres?

One of the handful of writers that can do sci-fi, horror and mystery all equally well."
stephenking,31x7y1,Johnson90,2,Thu Apr 9 00:40:56 2015 UTC,"One horror writer I think deserves more attention is Ronald Malfi.  I wouldn't say he's in the same vein as King, which can be good because he's certainly no imitator.  But being a King fan myself, I really like Malfi's work, so there may be a bridge there when it comes to personal taste.  SNOW was a good book of his, also THE NARROWS, CRADLE LAKE, and FLOATING STAIRCASE.    As for general fiction, there's a mystery/thriller writer by name of Gregg Hurwitz I really enjoy.  His narrative is always interesting, sometimes funny in spite of the high tension in his novels.  THE SURVIVOR was one of the better books I read last year.  THEY'RE WATCHING, TRUST NO ONE, and THE CRIME WRITER are all worthy reads if you're looking for a fast-paced this-should-be-a-movie type read."

The Drawing of the Three was good, The Wastelands was great, and I am now starting on Wizard and Glass which I'm super excited for.  Originally I couldn't tell you why I kept reading the books, as they didn't initially excite me or peek my interest but at this point.. I don't know. I feel as if I need to get to the Dark Tower now.

I was picturing Davis the entire time while reading the book.  Also, Sarah Gadon is not who I pictured in the role of Sadie either.  Not sure who I would have cast instead but she isn't really who I pictured.  Perhaps she'll surprise me and grow on me in the role.  Gadon is 5' 3"".  Isn't Sadie supposed to be kind of tall like Jake and a little awkward-like?  I seem to recall that description of her from the book.  I like Cherry Jones a lot so I'm excited she is in it."
stephenking,31sbm4,libertaint,3,Wed Apr 8 02:53:55 2015 UTC,"She's pretty though, casting agents like it when they're pretty. Plus Franco's not very tall so they needed another shorty."

stephenking,31q3p4,Iamjohn37,7,Tue Apr 7 07:26:47 2015 UTC,"My general rule with King is that if a kid is mature enough to understand what he's reading, then he's probably mature enough to handle the material.  My parents did everything they could to keep me away from anything with sex or violence when I was a kid. They actually took Zelda: Ocarina of Time away from me. Frankly, the result was that I wound up becoming that much more attracted to darker forms of fiction, writers like Stephen King, Gyllian Flynn, Joe Abercrombie, etc.  Honestly with the internet these days, I think it's a good thing that kids are reading at all and I don't think it should be discouraged.

stephenking,31q3p4,6isNotANumber,3,Tue Apr 7 14:24:49 2015 UTC,"I honestly think reading more mature works is far better than watching them on TV.  It forces the child to think about it more in a way, to participate mentally and emotionally, and maybe even gives the parents an opportunity to discuss the content as adults rather than just making him feel like a ""child"", and banning the books.  This will backfire, as it pushes the kid away from reading(kids don't read enough today as it is, right?), and also creates a rift between parent and child.  They should use it as an opportunity to help him grow, not try to keep him boxed into the ""vulnerable child that needs to be protected"" position.  Its not like he's reading 50 Shades of Grey...  And if they don't think he's using swear words on the playground, or talking about things with his friends that aren't ""age appropriate"", they are naive."

I don't remember having nightmares over anything I read, either - all my nightmare fuel came off the TV or from creepy pictures, text didn't seem to translate into dreamland at all.  Does depend on the kid though - every one needs to be approached on an individual basis."
stephenking,31q3p4,Szwejkowski,2,Tue Apr 7 08:45:04 2015 UTC,"I started him at around 12. my parents were super liberal in regards to what I watched and read, though. I remember watching Pet Sematary at around 6. However, I can imagine a parent not wanting their kid to read King at that age. My thought is that if a kid is interested in reading him, they're probably mature enough to handle the content. Though I might think twice if my kid was reading It. That freaking unnecessary scene."
stephenking,31q3p4,brightshinies,2,Tue Apr 7 11:10:49 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree, OP. Let that kid read. All of them."
stephenking,31q3p4,Sati1984,2,Tue Apr 7 12:18:30 2015 UTC,"I started reading at 10 with classic King (Firestarter, Cujo, the original Stand, Salem's Lot).   I seem to have made it through life ok. Running Man is actually one of the better books to start with, IMO, it's just a really good sci-fi book, without much overt horror (like, say Cujo)."
stephenking,31q3p4,errindel,2,Tue Apr 7 13:02:12 2015 UTC,"I would be happy for my child to start reading Stephen King at age 11, but I would also be very unhappy if her school sent her home with that book without prior discussion with me.  Stephen King's books contain a lot of explicit sex, violence, and horror, and it's not for a school to decide whether an 11 year-old is okay to be reading that, it is for the parents."
stephenking,31q3p4,_Pohaku_,2,Tue Apr 7 13:07:05 2015 UTC,"Sorry to say it, but if this is what she's worried about with an eleven year old boy, I don't think she has the first clue."
stephenking,31q3p4,CylonSpring,2,Tue Apr 7 14:32:54 2015 UTC,"I grew up in Stephen King stories. I know for a fact that my dad read Eyes of the Dragon to me and my brother when I was 6. I read The Stand in 5th grade. I think that as long as they can comprehend the story and are mature enough to handle the situations in the book, they should be fine."
stephenking,31q3p4,dannyisyoda,2,Tue Apr 7 16:32:58 2015 UTC,"I started reading King when I was 10. I was at the library and wandered out of the children's young adult area to try to find my mom in adult fiction. Luck had me start looking for her in the K section and the binding for Needful Things caught my eye. I pulled it off the shelf and loved the cover art, so much was happening. I cracked it open and read the first page of chapter one. Then I found myself get tired and sat down to finish chapter three.  The rest is magical history.   (My mom eventually found me. I asked if I could check it out and she said yes, knowing full well who Stephen King is.)  I personally don't think 11 is too young to start reading King. Unless the child never visits friends with older siblings, doesn't attend school with older children, avoids the internet, television, and billboard advertising...I doubt King will be their introduction to more mature words and topics.  All I remember about reading Needful Things that first time around was being delighted to see an adult (King) acknowledge that adults can be full of it and that age does not equal maturity. Plus he used the word cunt and fuck a lot and I thought it was such wicked fun to see them printed in a book.  The kid will understand what they understand. Some stuff will go over their head. Some stuff won't. But reading King isn't going to turn them into a deviant. Although, it might lead to the habit of reading all the time inside, which, at most might cause a vitamin D deficiency, so I guess there is that terror to protect the children from."
stephenking,31q3p4,squarerootofpi,2,Tue Apr 7 18:30:49 2015 UTC,"My mom had original King hardcovers on our bookshelf for as long as I can remember. I think I picked up my first one at like 9 or 10 and didn't quite get it. My mom never told me no though. I didn't pick up another King book until 7th grade, which was The Eyes of the Dragon.   My mom had read all of King's books and would generally talk with me about them and encouraged me to read (she's one of my main reasons why I have a degree in English Lit/Film). I think 11 is probably fine, depending on his maturity. But then again, my parents let me watch Jason Goes to Hell when I was like 9 and Poltergeist when I was 7, so who knows. Although, I think ET fucked me up emotionally at 4 or 5."
stephenking,31q3p4,njgreenwood,2,Tue Apr 7 20:45:06 2015 UTC,Yes! ET was terrifying when I was a kid. That scene where Elliot first finds ET outside in the field and he starts screaming... So scary haha
stephenking,31q3p4,him1087,2,Wed Apr 8 19:36:43 2015 UTC,"I'm glad to see I am not alone. He is a rather sheltered kid, and his mom seems to want him to be her baby boy forever.   Not sure if this is the cause or one of them,  but her and her family moved to TN recently and really became ""devout"" Christians. They are now apparently considering home school.   I hate to say it but I could see his life at a crossroads now and if she brings him home and bans certain readings, things look bleak for my little nephew. I wish I lived closer and could be his cool liberal uncle haha. But then again, I would likely be shunned as well."
stephenking,31q3p4,duckyvoodoo,2,Tue Apr 7 21:05:17 2015 UTC,"I was 12 when I started reading King. If your sister thinks that librarians should be censoring what kids read, she should put that kid in a religious private school."
stephenking,31q3p4,HammerMountain,1 point,Tue Apr 7 23:21:17 2015 UTC,I'd say 9 or 10. Maybe 12+ if they're not mature enough. Kids nowadays are more desensitized than in the past towards rough language/violence.

Hell, the movie is actually kinda campy in places, but the book is straight-up dystopian scifi.      Spoilers Ahead-  It's implied (if not outright stated) that Richards' wife is turning tricks to feed their emphysema ridden infant daughter, and he slams a passenger jet into the Games Building at the end FFS...    The violence in the film is standard, over the top, 80s action-flick to a ""T"" (down to the hero quip/dispatch the villain/kiss the girl all in the last 5 minutes...) the novel OTOH, is pretty fucking bleak...everybody dies by the end and it's really not clear that Richards changed anything."

Reading King got me into horror movies and into reading. I expanded my cinematic tastes over the years but always read books. His books got me into reading and I hope that I can use his books to getting kids into reading as well.  I'd much rather they read than spend countless hours in front of a video game or a computer."

But I was never prone to nightmares, I understood the difference between real and make-believe, and I understood that it was a book meant for people older than I was.  Given all of these things, I read it--loved it--and started on a path that led to more adult books.    I'm now thirty and I'm not desensitized, psychotic, or unstable.  But I am smarter than my friends who continued reading comic books and Boxcar Children serials while I moved on to grown-up fiction.    When my son is ten--if he's so inclined--I intend to introduce him to King's work.  Although I'll probably give him something a little tamer.  Eyes of the Dragon, or The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, or something like that."

stephenking,31onfw,crashdemon,1 point,Tue Apr 7 00:44:55 2015 UTC,"The Dark Tower is Kings ""lord of the rings"". I personally love the entire series. Wizard and Glass was my favorite. I never felt like I had to push through it. I consider it the base of everything else he has written. I tell anyone who will listen that if you like king read the dark tower. Kings adaptation are almost never as good as the source material. Just dive in start with some short stories if you like those move on to a novel if you like that give dark tower a try. You wont regret it."

stephenking,31lntk,newcinemajournalist,1 point,Mon Apr 6 16:02:34 2015 UTC,"For me, it's Under the Dome signed from when I saw him in St Paul.   As for my dad, who is a huge collector, it would probably be The Stand Coffin Edition. I unfortunately can't post pictures of it because it is currently being shipped to our house, but you can find pictures online easily."
stephenking,31lntk,HoraceDerwent,1 point,Mon Apr 6 17:46:57 2015 UTC,I have a signed first edition of Doctor Sleep that I got when I saw the man himself speak at a small gathering in Manhattan. I bought a extra copy to read because NO ONE touches my signed copy. Its my absolute prized possession.
stephenking,31kc4l,WeGotDodgsonHere,9,Sun Apr 5 22:36:52 2015 UTC,"Patrick Danville was also in Insomnia which was published, I believe, in 1993. In that book he drew pictures of the gunslinger. I don't know what King's ultimate intention for the character was at the time but he had an obvious connection to the DT and Roland's quest."
stephenking,31kc4l,Phifty2,4,Sun Apr 5 22:57:32 2015 UTC,That's true. Perhaps he meant it as the ultimate bringing-books-together instance?
stephenking,31kc4l,The_Jacob,12,Sun Apr 5 23:34:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah it was, see way back in 1994 King wrote Insomnia, the story of Ralph Roberts and his sleep disorder. The focus of that book was Patrick Danville, who was going to be killed by Ed Deepneau, cousin to Aaron Deepneau]. The reason that Patrick was the focus of the book was because he was destiny to have something to do with the death of the Crimson King. Not only that, but it also hails back to Roland's test of manhood against Cort, in which he uses his hawk, David, to win.   The entire thing is a callback to how Roland uses others to attain his goals and how he is slowly learning to value the lives of his companions."
stephenking,31kc4l,LozziWithALongO,2,Mon Apr 6 01:29:52 2015 UTC,It's funny. The Crimson King tried to kill Patrick through Ed and then Patrick ends up killing The Crimson King through his sketchpad.
stephenking,31kc4l,The_Jacob,2,Mon Apr 6 02:23:16 2015 UTC,"And much like when Roland used David to defeat Cort, he used Patrick to kill the King. It rounds out the story nicely."
stephenking,31kc4l,Nowin,2,Mon Apr 6 04:41:43 2015 UTC,"And remember, Roland's quest was not about the Crimson King at all. If the Crimson King hadn't been in the Tower, Roland wouldn't have given him a second thought. He was an obstacle, not an enemy."
stephenking,31kc4l,city17_dweller,2,Mon Apr 6 07:41:45 2015 UTC,"not an enemy   He was breaking the beams that held the world(s) together; Roland's initial quest was to find and fix the Dark Tower, so eliminating the Crimson King would have been part of the job.  It was Roland's personal quest to enter and walk up, though.  Technically, he didn't have to do that, at all."
stephenking,31kc4l,Nowin,2,Mon Apr 6 10:43:56 2015 UTC,"He was tasked by the beam to do that, but I don't think it was his true quest. I think he mainly saved the beam in order to be able to get to the tower before it fell."
stephenking,31kc4l,TotallyNot_MikeDirnt,3,Mon Apr 6 10:47:51 2015 UTC,"To put it bluntly, I think he wrote himself into a hole and that was the only way he could find to get out."
stephenking,31kc4l,1upthebumnoharmdone,2,Sun Apr 5 22:49:49 2015 UTC,Basically King is terrible at writing endings to his books.   Source: pretty much everything he's written since his very early work.
stephenking,31kc4l,GeeSpot007,3,Mon Apr 6 00:16:58 2015 UTC,And he's the first to admit it. He actually prefers the movie ending to It over his ending.

I see you now, looking at your bookshelf almost giddy with excitement as you come up with the cool idea to take photographs of your ""collection"" and post them on Reddit. I see you. I also see the emptiness inside. The hole which can only be filled by 7 short stories only published in magazines. You tell everyone things are good, things are fine, but they're not, are they? The smile on your face is hollow. The vacant expression behind your dead eyes is one belonging to a lost soul. You have nothing. You are nothing.

Kudos to Mr.  King for that. Being able to write great characters at both ends of the spectrum.  It's not easy to find writers who can do that.

This demon child who's been breeding in Susannah and comes out initially as a bad ass who manages to kill Flagg who's been around forever and caused so much havoc throughout the SK universe ends up just being this whiny petulant half human/half spider baby child who follows the ka-tet for a long ways doing nothing but being really jealous of their close relationship.  At no point does he make a move to attack them nor does Roland deal with him at any point even though Roland knows Mordred's tracking them until Mordred eventually gets sick from eating spoiled meat if you will which King of course describes in disgusting detail and then Mordred finally attacks only to be killed fairly easily at the expense of Oy's life. I'm not one to cry when reading things or characters die, but Oy's death was a close one and it also annoyed me that he met his demise at the hands of such a joke of a character like Mordred."

The other I'm not sure of is Tom Cullen but I don't know the actor, and I'm pretty sure the picture won't be representative, so that's more a 'don't know', than a 'disagree'.

The guy that played Grandpa in the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre was only 18. Jasmine Guy is in her 50's and plays a 70 something grandmother in The Vampire Diaries.

Ummm.. Maybe consider the fact that Curry is turning 69 this year and may not want to reprise the same character for the same story he's already done for 2 or 3 more films?   I really think people should lay off and try to keep an open mind. The fact that Cary Fukunaga is directing is a great start."

Tim Curry is the only standout figure in the miniseries; everything else imo is forgettable or laughable.  The book is a masterpiece, Curry's performance is iconic, but the miniseries itself is ""meh.""    I expect Fukunaga's adaptation to be miles ahead of IT that was shown on TV.  Sure, it'd be cool if Curry could reprise his role in a significantly better produced version of IT--but as you've said, why would he?  His portrayal of Pennywise is iconic, and he's aged--he doesn't want to keep doing the same role over and over again.

I remember watching the miniseries on video when I was a kid, way too young to probably be watching it.  I think there was me and a group of friends doing a New Years Eve sleepover I think and we watched it.  I remember it scaring the shit out of me as a kid.  I bought the DVD of it for like $5 one time and I tried to re-watch it.  I couldn't get much past the beginning where Georgie dies.  That scene of him following the boat down the street in the rain and meeting Pennywise... that's pretty much the only thing that stuck with me over the years.  I couldn't bring myself to actually watch it all the way through, it just freaked me out too much going back to the childhood memories.  Fun story, I went to film school and one of my professors was the cinematographer on the mini series and he brought in photocopies of the storyboards one time for a lesson.  Pretty neat to see.  Also, Tim Curry definitely still has the ability to be creepy.  Anyone see his 2-episode guest spot from Criminal Minds in 2010?"

Time after time, years gone by, just the weight of time and circumstance, combining with all these different human emotions to create this medley of pain .  And these were two things that were a key part of the vibe of True Detective as well. Lots of other similarities as well. The atmosphere of suspense and fear, a stark look at the ugliness of human depravity and people being bonded by a common cause."

Everyone goes on about Rage because it's out of print but I wasn't overly impressed by it and I downright hated Roadwork.  BUT The Running Man was great and The Long Walk is one of my favorite works of his.  I actually felt fatigued after reading it.

stephenking,30tb3y,PoliticalMilkman,3,Mon Mar 30 16:38:07 2015 UTC,"OP, I think your premise is a little flawed. Remember, most of the Vegas residents were good people. They were attracted to Vegas for legitimate reasons -- electricity, the rule of law, etc.   You imply that Vegas was a place with an ""anything goes"" type attitude. That couldn't be further from the truth. That was actually Boulder -- remember, they struggled to police drunk driving, to recruit good labor, etc. If you wanted to be a drunk, a bum, a shut-in, a gambler -- whatever -- Boulder was probably for you (at least in the beginning). In Vegas, hard work was mandatory. And the guy who was caught doing drugs? Publicly crucified.   So, I would probably choose Boulder -- but not for the reasons you imply."
stephenking,30tb3y,handawanda,1 point,Mon Mar 30 18:15:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think it was that simple. Maybe in the original version of The Stand it was? But not in the unabridged version. It was implied (or maybe outright stated) that most of the residents of Vegas were good people that were attracted to the sense of order that Vegas provided. As for what sort of dreams the Vegas folks had, that was left a little ambiguous. Maybe they dreamed of both and were scared of both? Maybe they didn't dream at all? It's not clear. But Once they settled in Vegas, it eventually became clear to them that Flagg was evil, but by then they were either brainwashed or too scared to leave.   EDIT: There is definitely a reference to some of Boulder's residents leaving for Vegas (not just Harold and Nadine, others too). It's implied that people started trickling out of Boulder when word got around that the rebuilding process was progressing much more quickly in Vegas. Another example that the two cities' populations weren't strictly divided between good and evil."
stephenking,30tb3y,handawanda,2,Mon Mar 30 20:25:44 2015 UTC,"Vegas. Not because I'm a bad person, but because I need the order.   To be honest though, I'm betting that I would be among the many dead."
stephenking,30tb3y,bottomlinebeast,2,Mon Mar 30 20:47:31 2015 UTC,Wasn't the whole point you don't know and you don't choose - its chosen for you? There were good people in vegas. There were bad people in boulder. Nadine was a good person but she was taken by RF. Larry was a scumbag pre tripps but eventually was a leader of good.   You dont know until it hapens and you certaintky dont choose.
stephenking,30tb3y,KicksButtson,2,Mon Mar 30 20:03:11 2015 UTC,"I'm probably a Vegas person, but I'm totally okay with that...  I think one of the important messages in that plot is that while all the seemingly ""bad"" people go to Vegas, it's actually the ""good"" people of Boulder who send spies. While the dark man and his friends in Vegas might have had nukes it was the people of Boulder who started the conflict. I'm not sure King intended it, but to me the message is that the paranoia of good well-meaning people is often more dangerous than the general preparedness of the less friendly. In reality most conflicts are started due to misunderstandings originating from paranoid people who think they're on the side of good."

Evil doesn't protect evil.  If I went to Vegas I'd constantly have to wonder when I'd anger or disobey Flagg, or one of his supporters, and end up dead.    It's better to be on the side of good and have higher odds of safety than to team up with evil and get killed by your own kind or get killed by the good people.  If you go to Vegas, you're resigning yourself to a shorter, nastier life.  It might be cool to be Flagg's henchman for a while, but eventually your luck will run out."
stephenking,30tb3y,aatencio91,1 point,Mon Mar 30 17:37:52 2015 UTC,"Boulder. I'm not some super good dude, but I certainly wouldn't consider myself evil. I'd try to help out those around me and uphold the good ol' American dream of truth and justice.   Also I work a block or two away from Stu and Frannie's Pearl Street apartment so it's a hell of a lot easier to get to Boulder than it is to get to Vegas."
stephenking,30tb3y,pakap,1 point,Mon Mar 30 19:59:09 2015 UTC,"Boulder. I don't deal well with stupid authority figures, so if I went to Vegas I'd probably tell Lloyd or another mid-level boss to go fuck himself and then I'd get crucified.  I'd probably join one of the committees too, because I hate standing around doing nothing. Might join Stu and become a deputy or something, he sounds like a good person to work for. Or start a school - I work with kids already, wouldn't be too much of a stretch.  Also, I'd try to get Larry and Leo to get a band together. Both of'em on guitar/vocals, I'd play bass, we'd just need to find a drummer. Rebuild a mid-size venue and do weekly gigs. I'd put Tom Cullen in charge of decorating it.  ...I might have spent a little too long building these scenarios in my head when I first read The Stand as a kid.

I relate to that, as I wasn't a good kid but I wasn't a bad one either, just one who was dragged down by the toxic people I thought were my friends."
stephenking,30pfyf,ughalready,2,Mon Mar 30 15:05:59 2015 UTC,I love this answer. I always found Lloyd to be one of the most compelling characters in the book. People love Stu Redman -- and he's great at what he does as the straight protagonist type -- but Stu is so boring and one-dimensional when compared to the Lloyds and Larry Underwoods of the world.

The ending and the woman who played Mrs Carmody absolutely killed it. Such a detestable antagonist. She was human tennis elbow, she was a pizza burn on the roof of the world's dick, she was the AT&T of people.   I imagine somewhere in fiction hell there's a Hall of GigaDouche where she's hanging out with the likes of Joffrey Baratheon, Draco Malfoy and The Miz."

stephenking,30qain,gloamingchild,6,Mon Mar 30 16:10:39 2015 UTC,Yes.  The pacing and Kings descriptive ability allow you to paint a richer mental landscape.  I very much enjoyed the book; it was my favorite work of King's for a long time.
stephenking,30qain,brentfield,5,Sun Mar 29 22:44:11 2015 UTC,"Especially given how short and easy a read it is, absolutely. The movie is probably the best take on a King horror story (unless I am forgetting something obvious? Shawshank Redemption is the reason I add the 'horror' qualifier, because of how excellent get movie is), but the source material is vintage King. There is one aspect that he thinks the movie did better. You'll recognize it when you get to it. But even that aside, The Mist is a great read."
stephenking,30qain,StevenRayOrr,4,Mon Mar 30 00:42:21 2015 UTC,They are both quite excellent except that I have never understood King saying the ending of the movie was better. The movie has a great ending IF you hit stop as soon as the gunshot happens.   Gunshot. Cut to black. PERFECT ENDING.  What actually happens is one of the most inanely stupid endings I have ever seen in a movie. Still stands out as the most annoyed I've ever been at a great movie. It really became my personal little axe to grind... SERIOUSLYFUCKTHELAST30SECONDSOFTHATMOVIEAAAAAUUUGGGHHITSSOFUCKINGDUMMBBBBBBBBBAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUGGGGGGGGGGG
stephenking,30qain,gloamingchild,1 point,Mon Mar 30 15:45:55 2015 UTC,"I liked the movie ending, despite it being kind of unrealistic. And I'd wager that SK said to himself, ""Oh man I wish I had written that ending in stead of having the characters drift off into the unknown."" Because although the 'unknown' ending is wistful and thought-provoking, the ending from the movie is much more definite and provides a measure of closure that's missing from the book ending.  That said I totally understand why you hate the movie ending, it makes the whole struggle to get out of the store seem in vain and to the right mind might come off as cheap or lazy. But I personally do feel like it was used to good effect."
stephenking,30qain,gloamingchild,2,Mon Mar 30 16:11:30 2015 UTC,"It's not even quite that. The whole devastating ""it was all in vain"" thing would be fine. It's only that it happens in the span of 25 seconds and then we get the shot of the woman from earlier who ran off into the fog riding on the truck with her kids giving him the ""you should have helped me"" look.

What I will say is this: It is incredible to me, first of all, how true the movie remained to the book, except for the final scene. Even though the director chose a different ending, everything that happened in the movie was alluded to as being a possibility in the book. Regardless, I felt the movie better-paced and excellently directed and I'd choose the movie over the book ten times out of ten."

stephenking,30qgs5,Breadcrumbsandbows,3,Sun Mar 29 20:50:41 2015 UTC,"My family lives in Maine. Summer is really the best weather/season for Maine, I think. Even if it's still the touristy season, everything fun is still open and the weather is beautiful. Second best time would be the first week of September, because the weather is still nice, but lots of cool beachy-touristy things (lobster roll/ice-cream/shops, etc.) close labor day weekend and sometimes even the last week of August.   For Stephen King related stuff, i've only ever been to a few of the things, like the Kennebec Fruit Co. from 11/22/63 in Lisbon Falls. you'll find a lot of his inspirations in that area. The other major area being the Bangor area, which is where he lives and the inspiration for Derry.   Just for touristy Maine stuff, I like the drive up old highway 1/maine state route 9 in the south through kennebunk/kennebunkport/biddeford/old orchard beach. Portland's Old Port area is great for shopping/food. I recommend J's Oyster for a great hole in the wall place (if you like seafood). Historic Fort Knox is cool. Also my favorite lighthouse is on Pemaquid point.  My parents have a house on a lake, so my Maine summer experience is sort of the quintessential King scary house on a lake experience, so I would also recommend at least renting and spending a night or two in a wooded remote cabin on a lake somewhere in central Maine to get the full Maine experience. Plus it's just not Maine without a couple days on a lake.  That was a lot. If you need more you can PM me.  TL:DR Maine is pretty cool. There's lots to do."

I read every Stephen King novel but the Dark Tower series until I read Hearts In Atlantis and that story unlocked the Dark Tower for me in a special way. The Talisman was one of my favorite King novels of all time and Black House came out when I was reeling from the awareness that all his novels are connected to the Dark Tower in some way. Black House dropped during this hazy phase for me and I welcomed it with arms opened wide. I'm interested to see if it holds up when I go back to re read.

stephenking,30jsdf,icecamel,3,Sat Mar 28 00:43:36 2015 UTC,"I loved Cell. He did go a bit more Arthur Miller with it though. As stories go, it was okay, but the social commentary was great."
stephenking,30jsdf,Rev_Jim_lgnatowski,6,Sat Mar 28 02:38:14 2015 UTC,Ugh the ending of Cell was the WORST.
stephenking,30jsdf,measureinlove,3,Sat Mar 28 02:45:58 2015 UTC,"damn, my last attempt into king was Joyland and i could not fucking handle all the carny lingo he was trying out. i ditched the book after 100 pages."
stephenking,30jsdf,chhubbydumpling,6,Sat Mar 28 01:34:37 2015 UTC,"Noooo I loved Joyland! Give it another try someday when you're a bit more removed—it's a great story, I think."
stephenking,30jsdf,measureinlove,3,Sat Mar 28 02:45:34 2015 UTC,"I must agree with everyone else, did not like this book. The intro was so promising. This and From A Buick 8 are two King novels I really didn't care for, but read them anyways.  It's still a Stephen King book."
stephenking,30jsdf,im_not_a_writer,3,Sat Mar 28 01:47:09 2015 UTC,My feelings exactly. I'm pretty sure this will be the only example ever of the adaptation being better than the book. It's the only story of King's that I've straight up hated. It's basically the shittiest rehash of The Stand.
stephenking,30jsdf,gloamingchild,2,Sat Mar 28 01:12:22 2015 UTC,"It's one of the last few books of his I haven't read. I have it on my Nook because it was on sale for $2 a while back, but I haven't started it yet. That and Tommyknockers are the two I'm looking forward to the least."

stephenking,30ibu9,gloamingchild,3,Sat Mar 28 04:13:15 2015 UTC,"Did you seriously just post a story about someone's actual murder, complete with images of the suffering family, as a way to illustrate a fictional story?"
stephenking,30ibu9,mementomori4,4,Fri Mar 27 18:51:51 2015 UTC,"OP's not using it to illustrate the story, just saying that the circumstances of the boy's demise were reminiscent of some of the killings in IT. It's unreasonable to castigate OP for just drawing attention to this correlation. I'd bet my paycheck that nobody would have a problem with this if the incident in question happened 10+ years ago."

stephenking,30ew1b,TheWildRover_,8,Thu Mar 26 20:27:11 2015 UTC,I don't think so.   Bowers was evil.  Henry dean was just an addict.
stephenking,30ew1b,CortOfEld,2,Fri Mar 27 10:21:59 2015 UTC,"Ehhh...not sure if Henry Dean was ""evil"" ...that's a strong word...but in The Waste Lands we learn he was a manipulative dick. Basically mentally abused Eddie whenever Eddie displayed semi-competence at anything (woodworking being one example). It's basically implied that Eddie felt powerless to pursue a straight life, because Henry convinced him that being a junkie and a drug mule was the only thing he was capable of. We also see this displayed when Eddie feels helpless to carve the key to free Jake, because he keeps hearing Henry in his head taunting him.   There's also this:   [Henry] had her newspaper in his hands. She grabbed for it. The newspaper-grabber—he was wearing denims and a black T-shirt with the sleeves rolled up—held it over his head and grinned. ""Jump for it, Maryanne! Jump, girl, jump!"" She stared at him with angry eyes, her cheeks flushed. ""Give it to me!"" she said. ""Quit fooling around and give it back! Bastard!"" ""Oooo wisten to dat, Eddie!"" the old kid said. ""Bad wang-gwidge! Naughty, naughty!""  ... The big boy's face was one that Jake had seen before; it was the face of a kid who would think it the height of hilarity to douse a cat's tail with lighter fluid or feed a bread-ball with a fishhook planted in the middle to a hungry dog. The sort of lad who sat in the back of the room and snapped bra-straps and then said ""Who me?"" with a big, dumb look of surprise on his face when someone finally complained... He guessed that in the old days, people would have said it was the face of a boy who was born to be hung."

They also have guides for identifying first editions (as a rule, they have either the mention ""First Edition""/""First Printing"" or the numbers ""10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1"" on the copyright page - it can vary though).  If you're in the States and can wait a bit, I'd go to signing next time Steve is in your state and get the most valuable signed. Bit churlish, but it will up their value considerably.  ""Book clubs"" editions usually aren't worth much, but again, check abebooks for the specific book you have (going by ISBN number). Rare-books pricing is super weird, like all collectible stuff.

stephenking,2zytmt,graham_a_bama,2,Mon Mar 23 01:48:05 2015 UTC,"For non-horror, character stuff, you might want to try Revival, Mr. Mercedes or 11/22/63.  I also adore Eyes of the Dragon - much more of a fairy tale. Lisey's Story and Duma Key are, IMHO horror-lite. There's supernatural stuff going on but not nightmare-inducing stuff like IT."

stephenking,2zytmt,docwilson,2,Mon Mar 23 02:29:11 2015 UTC,"There's a large swath of King's works I haven't read just because I latched onto Dark Tower first. I simply found many of his earlier horror novels too densely-written and too train-of-thought to read.  But now that I'm older, and I've got a few novels of my own under my belt (my DT-inspired gunslinger series, ahem), I'm more easily able to wrap my mind around books like The Shining and Misery, (both of which I heartily recommend, as well as Christine, which is the best vampire novel I've ever read) and it's really paying off. I'm glad I waited this long to read them because in retrospect I feel like they've aged like a fine wine in comparison to my mental evolution.  Not to mention I've got books to read now that aren't poisonous to my writing voice."

It didn't freak me out THAT much and it has some phenomenal character development, one of his best IMO. Also, I highly recommend Carrie even though you said you've avoided it. It's really not that scary compared to IT or The Shining (to me, at least) and it's the first he wrote IIRC. Also, Christine is really good and not overly scary, it's a great way to kind of ease into the horror genre.  Please read IT. It'll freak you out to no end, but you'll feel SO accomplished after finishing it! I just finished it not too long ago and watched the movie (4/10, hardly stayed true to the book at all and left out some important background).

stephenking,2zyj5f,4verticals,2,Mon Mar 23 00:17:08 2015 UTC,"It all kind of depends on what kind of collection you want. Some people really like tracking down US first editions. Living in the States, I've seen just a handful of UK editions. For me, I like to have the US editions because they're the easiest for me to get. Even when writers are not American, I like to have US editions because UK editions feel very weird to me in comparison to US editions. Different paper stock, different spine design. Different feel. Not better or worse, but distinct.  I think it all comes down to personal preference. And for someone like Stephen King, whose first printing runs have been huge for most of his career, first editions aren't really worth more than any other, UK or otherwise. A first edition of The Shining is very valuable. A first edition of IT is not.  If you want to get early King firsts, that's a very expensive game. If, however, you just want to have attractive books to read and display, get the ones you like best and can afford. The difference in value between them is negligible."
stephenking,2zyj5f,Berjiwhir,2,Mon Mar 23 00:57:22 2015 UTC,"Interesting, thanks a lot. Why is a first of the Shining valuable but IT isnt?"
stephenking,2zyj5f,Berjiwhir,3,Mon Mar 23 01:04:55 2015 UTC,"Good question! The Shining was only his third book, and so the publisher did not print nearly as many first editions and they did, say, of IT, of which they probably printed a few million. As he became more popular, they printed more and more books when each was released. Scarcity is a big part of what makes a book valuable."

December 2012 I had a kid and I quit, got a job, got a place to live, and got full custody. Weird to say the heroin-addict character I liked as a middle schooler indirectly helped me get my shit together but it's true. Scott Landon.

I think the character that impacted me the most was Henry Dean, not the heroin part. The bit where he's playing keep away with the paper of the girl who works at the movie theater did a number on me. King's reflection on Henry taking things too far and acting like the victimized party because ""it was just a joke"" led me to some heavy self evaluation."
stephenking,2zuq6z,rdlvr,3,Sun Mar 22 05:18:56 2015 UTC,"Which character do you relate to most out of King's work and why?    Gordie LaChance, in The Body (Stand By Me).  I grew up with 3 friends who eerily mirror Teddy, Verne, and Chris.  Naturally, I was a writer who would often tell ridiculous stories to entertain my friends. ""I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was twelve. Jesus, does anyone?""   Which character would you say is your favorite, if you had to choose?   My favorite character is probably Pete, the college-aged narrator in Hearts In Atlantis.  I can't speak for the 60s, but King captures the essence of college students so well in that story.  My freshman year, Super Smash Bros 64 took over the first floor of my dorm.  People were betting money on matches and spending far too much time with it.  What eventually prompted me to quit playing was thinking about the boys in Chamberlain Hall, throwing away their scholarships and their lives playing Hearts.   Which character has haunted you for the longest and why?   A bit unconventional, but Paul Edgecombe haunts me the most (The Green Mile).  That last epilogue just tears me up every time.  Sometimes, oh God, the green mile is so long."

stephenking,2ziv19,Phifty2,8,Wed Mar 18 22:58:44 2015 UTC,"I love his book ""Ghost Story"". The 80's movie adaption was somewhat disappointing."
stephenking,2ziv19,71nobody,3,Wed Mar 18 23:45:18 2015 UTC,"I read Ghost Story and Mr. X years ago and loved both of them. Ditto for The Talisman and Black House.  Shortly after that, I read Lost Boy, Lost Girl and its sequel In the Night Room. I think I liked the first one and disliked the sequel, because it got pretty meta.   Just recently bought Ghost Story so I'm looking forward to rereading that."
stephenking,2ziv19,GaijinSama,4,Thu Mar 19 02:03:55 2015 UTC,"I think Ghost Story doesn't hold up to scrutiny. I reread it a couple years ago and was pretty let down. I think it's a pretty conservative book, in a way his later works aren't.  I actually really like In The Night Room, though I know that's not the popular opinion. I might not like it on a revisit, but I really liked some of his meta flourishes."
stephenking,2ziv19,rsholman,4,Thu Mar 19 02:06:32 2015 UTC,I'm re-reading The Talisman right now and was wondering if I'd like Straub (also wondering what parts each author wrote).  I'm definitely going to check out Floating Dragon next.
stephenking,2ziv19,sarabande45,3,Wed Mar 18 23:25:54 2015 UTC,The Talisman is my favourite book ever.
stephenking,2ziv19,foulmouthangel,3,Thu Mar 19 07:40:30 2015 UTC,"Black House was the most painful book I've ever read. It took me AGES to finish and I've been reluctant to ever try it again. I stumbled across Ghost Story and read it, it was pretty good, but it was definitely his writing style, mixed with King's tendency to be long-winded that made Black House drive me crazy."
stephenking,2ziv19,GaijinSama,2,Thu Mar 19 10:40:35 2015 UTC,"I posted this topic last month. I agree he's a pretty great author that's unfortunately been overshadowed by his collaborations with King. If you haven't read it yet, A Dark Matter is fucking mindblowing. I think it might be the ultimate Peter Straub book. Maybe not the best(I'm not willing to make that call yet), but certainly the purest expression of how he approaches horror as a genre."
stephenking,2ziv19,GaijinSama,1 point,Thu Mar 19 00:01:48 2015 UTC,After not loving In the Night Room and reading bad reviews I never read A Dark Matter. I will now.
stephenking,2ziv19,cheese_hotdog,1 point,Thu Mar 19 23:54:37 2015 UTC,"A lot of the complaints seem to be that it's a bit unfocused, but that's part of what I liked about it. It's about a character trying to figure out this defining moment in the lives of his friends(and wife) that he missed out on when they were younger. It has a couple different segments that almost feel like separate books, and one that could have been it's own novella. But again, I kinda liked that stuff. I think it added up to something more profound than a lot of critics admit."
stephenking,2ziv19,thewindupbirds,2,Fri Mar 20 05:41:54 2015 UTC,I like Lost Boy Lost Girl a lot as well.
stephenking,2ziv19,arsmorendi,2,Thu Mar 19 03:24:37 2015 UTC,"I adore Straub! Ghost Story and The Hellfire Club are masterful. I love him nestling books-in-books, so delightfully meta but it always is integral to the storyline."
stephenking,2ziv19,arsmorendi,2,Thu Mar 19 05:31:21 2015 UTC,"FLoating Dragon has a very ""IT"" like feeling to it."
stephenking,2ziv19,RisingRapture,1 point,Thu Mar 19 19:15:36 2015 UTC,"I've read Floating Dragon four times and the last time I read it I deliberately went in with the mindset that everything that happened was the result of DRG16 with nothing supernatural at all and, surprisingly, it works. There's nothing you can't put down as mass hysteria, hallucinations, psychosis, and just a plain old bad trip. To think that even the protagonists battled no evil creature and were just as caught up in the madness like everyone else gives the story a new dynamic. I used to think it was 70/30 Gidean Winter/DRG16 but now, like the characters, I don't know what, if anything, was caused by any ancient, supernatural force."
stephenking,2zhzf2,PutYourLilHandInMine,7,Wed Mar 18 19:07:42 2015 UTC,"This is by far my favorite SK book and I'm a big fan. Every time I  read it, it fills me with dread and anxiety, it fascinates me on some level I don't quite understand... I always wondered about the Mcvries aspect of it. Would he have won? Would Garrity have won if Stebbins and Mcvries did not take part in the Walk?"
stephenking,2zhzf2,-lux,4,Wed Mar 18 21:46:41 2015 UTC,I think McVries would have won for sure but I think he wanted to die and that's the underlying theme of the book. None of them really wanted to win; they joined the Walk because the odds were good that they'd die in it.  Maybe not Scramm but he wasn't painted as the brightest bulb in the lamp.
stephenking,2zhzf2,-lux,3,Wed Mar 18 22:46:08 2015 UTC,"Speaking of Scramm, sure he wasn't the brightest but if he didn't get sick who knows, he probably would have 'walked them into the ground!' :) . I liked how it ended. I wonder if SK ever had thoughts of dusting off Bachman and if yes ever wondered about some kind of sequel to The Long Walk. What do you think?"
stephenking,2zhzf2,Shalamarr,3,Wed Mar 18 23:04:36 2015 UTC,"I'd love a sequel! Another look at The Long Walk, maybe with some reference to Garraty's Walk being one of the few to make it into Massachusetts. If I recall correctly only one other Walk ever made it that far.  And maybe even some hints as to whether he lived or died and if he lived what he did with his Prize. That'd be cool.  But yeah Scramm seemed like he could have made it to the final five or less."
stephenking,2zhzf2,-lux,13,Wed Mar 18 23:16:20 2015 UTC,"Who is this Stephen King you speak of?   Richard Bachman wrote ""The Long Walk""!"
stephenking,2zhzf2,teaqualizer,3,Thu Mar 19 00:58:06 2015 UTC,"Oh pardon me, of course. ;)"
stephenking,2zhzf2,bmwhd,4,Thu Mar 19 01:07:30 2015 UTC,"I read the book a few years back and listened to the audio book last year (I highly recommend it), and I think I'm going to revisit it in a couple of weeks when I'm done listening to 11/22/63.   Did Garraty die at the end?   I think he died and then we are presented with one second of Garraty's afterlife horror to come. Gave me the willies just remembering this."
stephenking,2zjbpp,maeeberry,3,Thu Mar 19 01:16:18 2015 UTC,"All I know to tell you is to write to the 49 Florida Avenue, Bangor ME 04401 address.  It's pretty well known that if you do write there that it doesn't actually get to King himself but more than likely his agent. You may get a response from someone saying that he is too busy to answer fanmail with an autopen signature. It's better than nothing though."

stephenking,2zgtaq,arsmorendi,3,Wed Mar 18 13:53:08 2015 UTC,I am impressed.  My proudest addition to my Stephen King library is a first edition copy of Carrie.

stephenking,2zgtaq,church0581,1 point,Wed Mar 18 21:49:11 2015 UTC,"Carrie, It and The Stand are my only first editions. Plus The Green Mile. Great book, not a great way to release it. Especially if you can read one of the mini books in an hour or so."
stephenking,2zgtaq,darbguy,0,Thu Mar 19 05:26:22 2015 UTC,That's pretty slick. What is this from or about?
stephenking,2zhngp,the_monkeys,3,Wed Mar 18 17:44:04 2015 UTC,"I've read It three times now and read the extended edition of the Stand twice. I just find It overall a more satisfying and engaging read. Every chapter adds another layer to the overall image of Derry and the creature. The book is just crammed with memorable passages and evocative images. The Kirtchener ironworks, the umbilicus in the library, Ben's damn, birdwatching at the stand pipe, Pennywise shooting out of the window at an impossible angle, Baby Dorsey struggling to hold a crayon, the rocks returning to the field every year, the row of houses near the railway yard, ash handle, making the silver bullet, the vision of It arriving from the sky, the orderlies at the asylum carrying rolls of quarters to add weight to their punches, the deadlights, grey water and brown water and of course Patrick's intensifying dreams of the fridge.... The list goes on"
stephenking,2zhngp,teaqualizer,1 point,Fri Mar 20 21:46:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Baby Dorsey struggling to hold a crayon - that just broke my heart ... especially since becoming a father."
stephenking,2zhngp,EnIdiot,3,Wed Mar 25 17:47:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah,  IT and The Shining are the two most personal portrayals of King. The kids in IT and the town are heavily drawn from King's childhood. Jack Torrance is in many ways SK at his worse when drinking. The voice in both these works are (in my opinion) some of his most authentic and honest writing."
stephenking,2zhngp,SGSHBO,3,Thu Mar 19 01:51:13 2015 UTC,"The Shining is the only book that has ever made my heart race. The bit about the fire hose had me sweating. Shame about Doctor Sleep though, I didn't care for it too much.  It put me in the Losers Club. I wasn't listening to a story about them, I wasn't even watching them. I was with them. SK has such a knack for describing his ""monsters"" just vague enough to let your brain fill in the worst parts. I also LOVE how much Derry is developed in this book. It seems the more we find out, the less we know and that messes with my mind to no end."
stephenking,2zhngp,lastfinalgirl,2,Fri Mar 20 04:15:58 2015 UTC,"that's one i return to again and again myself. it's like meeting up with old friends. i enjoy ""Summer of Night"" quite a bit, but it doesn't have that same sense of heart. there's something decidedly ugly about it, where ""IT,"" and its characters, somehow manages to rise above all the muck.   come to think of it, it's been a couple of years now for me.. might be time to dust it off again. :)"
stephenking,2zhngp,painbird,1 point,Wed Mar 18 18:06:45 2015 UTC,"Oddly enough, I'm just about to start it again for the 4th time. I love this book. The mood, the characters, the depth of the plot. It's a nearly perfect book. I read this and the stand every few years.   The stand, to me, is kings best book and I love reading it right around June. Right when summer is starting in force."
stephenking,2zf03d,lovelesschristine,5,Wed Mar 18 00:49:18 2015 UTC,"Pretty intriguing and i've thought about this scenario as well,the thing that makes me think its a no go is the smaller creatures that come through in the mist.  What the monsters from N remind me of the most is the monster from liseys story.  With the endless piebald side.  The mist monsters make me think of From A Buick Eight, if troop D hadn't taken care of the car maybe scientists would of forced it  open and then lost control of it.  Those are my theories.  Good question"

stephenking,2zf03d,mellontree,2,Wed Mar 18 08:33:06 2015 UTC,Huh. Now I will be rereading 'N'.
stephenking,2zf03d,IamJacksUserID,1 point,Wed Mar 18 13:20:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think it ties into the Mist (as far as King's universe is concerned). King said N. was influenced by Machen's The Great God Pan, and other stories have been as well, like Revival, so probably just another story drawing from the same influences."
stephenking,2zf03d,obduratepast,1 point,Wed Mar 18 02:56:49 2015 UTC,"I think it's unlikely. The monster in """"N"" seemed aware and acting with the purpose of destruction (from the visions of the watchers). The creatures in ""The Mist"" are little more than animals - they could easily break into the convenience store, but settle for snatching people who leave."
stephenking,2zf03d,hohmeisw,1 point,Wed Mar 18 03:56:50 2015 UTC,"What is ""N""?  Cool, it's a short story in Just After Sunset. Im reading that now, so might have to skip ahead to that story  now :)"
stephenking,2zewks,Nichase,7,Wed Mar 18 00:20:04 2015 UTC,"I gotta disagree with this one, I get lost with Ralph and Lois the way i got lost with the Losers Club, and with Roland. Like i got lost in Lisey's Story. It hits me in just the right way, and it's one where i don't want the story to end."
stephenking,2zewks,mad_dog77,2,Wed Mar 18 02:51:39 2015 UTC,Me too. Each step they undertake is so important.
stephenking,2zewks,mementomori4,5,Wed Mar 18 04:05:22 2015 UTC,"I'm biased because it's one of my favorite books, but I think it's all necessary and part of the journey.   The begining is about his boredom and feeling a bit lost and not able to fill his days, add in the early waking and frustration from that, I think it's vital that the story takes it's time to unfold."
stephenking,2zewks,Eilish88,3,Wed Mar 18 03:01:14 2015 UTC,"i always felt like the pacing went along with the theme, it makes you feel restless but you want to keep going"
stephenking,2zewks,Randalflagg618,2,Wed Mar 18 04:07:29 2015 UTC,"IMO, it needs a completely different ending.   It's been a while since I've read it and I've been meaning to reread to see if my opinion has changed, but...  I didn't really have any issues with the pacing in the first half of the book. In fact, for the first half of the novel, I was convinced this was going to be my new favorite King book.   And then about halfway through, it stops being about paranoia and one man's possible descent into madness and (mild spoilers) essentially turns into a superhero story. That was too much of an abrupt about face for me. I was immensely disappointed with the latter half of the book.  It almost felt like he got halfway through the book and didn't know what to do with it, and then decided what it needed was to be a Dark Tower tie-in."
stephenking,2zewks,Randalflagg618,1 point,Wed Mar 18 03:09:35 2015 UTC,the ending of the story that you get in The Dark tower is probably the ending you want but not the one in the book lol
stephenking,2zewks,joshsaldana,2,Wed Mar 18 04:09:21 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Out of all the King books I've read it's my least favorite. When people ask me about Insomnia and I give a plot summary, it sounds good though. To me that is a sign that the central story is great, but it got stretched out too far and could use cutting."

stephenking,2z7s03,chefsinblack,4,Mon Mar 16 17:14:57 2015 UTC,"I always wanted the long walk adapted into a mini series. The whole thing being done to look like a reality tv show. The first episode would be largely interviews of the walkers and the beggining of the walk. It starts off looking really ordinary, as a sort of endurance competition. Tickets aren't really explained. Then the first walker dies and after that it just gets darker and darker. Cameras on the trucks follow what the walkers are doing, and we see them all slowly break. And it wouldn't be heavily focused on garrity so the audience is rooting for a bunch of different walkers, and game of thrones style we see them all die off."
stephenking,2z7s03,Dylex,3,Mon Mar 16 21:54:49 2015 UTC,"Ever since I heard The Jaunt was going feature-length, my brain has been trying to melt it into a 30-second film - gif? Its mostly a narrator and the background horror/history of the Jaunt system, the pleasant father shows/tells the horrors of the past (a la b/w documentaries on the efficiency of germans in the mid1900s) and we think we are leading up to how things are so much better in the narrative present because the dad/narrator has such a pleasant fairy-tale'ish tone and presentation ... and then the family's Jaunt concludes with the revelations of present horrific truths and such. But mostly I like to lose myself envisioning the sets and props for this story, it gets kinda Running Man'ish.

stephenking,2z6qak,gloamingchild,5,Mon Mar 16 09:48:05 2015 UTC,"Awesome. I think they said it Tim Curry who kept his distance from the cast. It goes along with his serious approach to acting, his private nature and the fact that he wasn't having a good time making the movie, one possible reason being he was so adverse to make-up after shooting Legend. Also, try and imagine being the only person on set dressed like a ridiculous fool the entire time. I'm sure that didn't improve his experience. I can't imagine his time filming or his opinions on the movie are the reason there's no video out there, though. The fact that he's a rare interviewee and that people ask broad questions are more likely reasons this is so hard to find. I believe it's out there, though. Just buried.  Fun fact: My friend and I just checked it and his screen time during the entire 3 hours of IT is... You ready?... 6 minutes. And that's adding a little time to round it out."

King said in an early promotional interview for Revival that his intention was to write a story using the Cthulhu mythos, drawing inspiration not just from Lovecraft but from Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and a book called The Great God Pan. I think Revival is one of King's best novels and his scariest by a long shot.   Here's the interview if anyone is interested: https://www.goodreads.com/interviews/show/989.Stephen_King"
stephenking,2yy3bd,claxonman2310,2,Fri Mar 13 20:30:30 2015 UTC,"I agree. I really thought the novel did a great job of building towards it, too. The scene in the revival tent, for example, is very reminiscent of Lovecraft."
stephenking,2yy3bd,spikestoker,2,Fri Mar 13 21:25:09 2015 UTC,"I just finished reading this novel because I kept hearing good things and I really like Lovecraftian adaptations.  I was really looking forward to it, but now that it's over I feel like this is one of the worst King novels I've ever read. The basic concept is good, but you don't reach the meat of the issue until the final 1/10th of the story or less. The story is such a slow boil, and not in a good way. The first 1/2 of the story is just backstory and filler.  Even once your reach the heart of the issue its not exactly terrifying. It's just The Reanimator mixed with some vague descriptions of visions into a Lovecraftian afterlife. I'm just not impressed. Why did I read 9/10th of the novel just to get to this? It offers nothing exceptional and asks for your extreme patience to get there."

Jamie is 6 at the start and in his 60s by the end. SPOILERS: As for the ending I really liked the idea of the curtain being lifted to show a world that punishes Jacobs for his melding rather than offering him comfort. I was surprised that Moray had his face and that there wasn't any mention of the smell of whiskey coming from Jacob's wife either.   I would wonder whether King had considered that chapter tying into the dark tower in some way. Kinda reminded me of the beam breaking facility at the end of Black House.

In it King compares Pop-Lit and Lit. He gracefully makes a case that critics often overlook solid work because in their minds the subject matter doesn't suit quality writing.   I'll cast the grace aside here -I feel those people are fucking snobs, and often criticize without even reading the work.

I guess that's where the difference in tastes lie. I don't like that feeling. It feels unnatural and I just can't really get into the groove when such events jar my mind around.

stephenking,2yn0wy,autowikibot,1 point,Mon Mar 16 18:38:15 2015 UTC,"Stockholm syndrome:       Stockholm syndrome, or capture-bonding, is a psychological phenomenon in which hostages express empathy and sympathy and have positive feelings toward their captors, sometimes to the point of defending and identifying with the captors. These feelings are generally considered irrational in light of the danger or risk endured by the victims, who essentially mistake a lack of abuse from their captors for an act of kindness.   The FBI's Hostage Barricade Database System shows that roughly 8% of victims show evidence of Stockholm syndrome.

stephenking,2yflqu,TimothyGonzalez,32,Mon Mar 9 11:53:52 2015 UTC,As with some (many?) of his books it's the journey and not the destination.  I'm actually re-reading the Stand now and I keep wishing he'd have just skipped the plot and written a thousand pages of descriptions of people living through and in the aftermath of that flu.  The first half of that book is absolutely fascinating.  Still one of his best books.

The first half of that book is absolutely fascinating.   Yes! I actually really enjoyed those. I think the book would've been better if it would've just been the story of the flu epidemic, possibly followed by stuff like murderous gangs forming and stuff like that, rather than this not really well-developed supernatural story. I also enjoyed the descriptions of empty NYC and insights into what happens when civilisation vanishes."

stephenking,2yflqu,The_Rapture_Raptor,5,Tue Mar 10 05:22:24 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised this is the only King book you have this gripe about. I mean most of them have this problem. He can't end a book, they always tend to be the weakest spot. And his novels are overly long. Most King criticisms are valid, but there is definitely something about his work that evades criticism. Which is why, despite agreeing with most complaints about his work, I will happily read each one, then usually feel moderately disappointed."
stephenking,2yflqu,steeljaw,1 point,Mon Mar 9 17:44:58 2015 UTC,"I don't think most of his books are overly long. The Dark Tower series was incredibly long but I enjoyed every second of it. I suppose the ending could've been better? I don't know how he could've ended it in a way that wasn't an anticlimax after all the buildup to the dark tower. I guess my real criticism for the stand though, is that I didn't enjoy the journey enough to make up for the disappointing ending."

stephenking,2yflqu,Pau_Zotoh_Zhaan,0,Mon Mar 9 14:05:05 2015 UTC,"No, RF was blinded by his determination to rule the world!! He was so obsessed with control that he sent an arsonist to go recover a nuke!!  Now, Randall Flagg's arrogance is what kills him in the end! He needs to show his dominate power, but in doing so sets off a chain reaction that wipes out his whole city!!    I don't think it's meant to say ""God saved the day"", I think it was meant to say ""when you are so hungry for power that it consumes your every thought, you will be the death of your own kind"""
stephenking,2yflqu,Pau_Zotoh_Zhaan,2,Tue Mar 10 02:28:44 2015 UTC,"Randall didn't send Trashcan Man to get the nuke, Trashy sought after it as a way to make amends for what he did to the helicopters, fuel trucks, and pilots.  RF losing his control over his operations because of his obsession with power did lead to his down fall, but in a less direct way. I always viewed the nuke blowing up because of ""The Hand of God"" as God using Randall's oversights and miscalculations against him at the most inopportune time.  The end of RF's reign and civilization as a whole is supposed to be viewed as ""God saving the day."" The whole book is about a supernatural struggle of Good versus Evil. In fact, it is said several times throughout the book that God has a plan and is working through the ones he has chosen to help him with said plan. All that the main protagonists had done in the novel to stop RF, lead to that final and perfectly timed intervention of ""The Hand of God."""

stephenking,2yflqu,The_Rapture_Raptor,3,Thu Mar 12 17:27:33 2015 UTC,"I feel you, but I don't think it was ever intended as a ""mistake"" by RF. Larry and Ralph are symbolically sacrificing themselves to ""stand"" against RF. In reality, they are hopelessly beaten/captured and have no chance to escape. The nuke exploding was the ""divine force"" they had been following the whole book. The same force that embodied mother Abigail and led all her family to her farm and to Boulder. It recognized their sacrifice and ""stood"" against it's opposite, evil force represented by RF."
stephenking,2yflqu,toddmusic,2,Mon Mar 9 15:18:09 2015 UTC,"I was underwhelmed by the ending, yes.  I also agree with people who have said it's the journey not the destination.  I also feel very strongly that the villains are way more interesting in The Stand than the good guys and I wish they had more chapters.  I also read it after I had finished the published books of A Song of Ice and Fire, which I think has eternally ruined any enjoyment of pure good vs. evil narratives for me.  So, with anything it's a mixed bag, but I do love it overall."

Also I thought Abigail wasn't even that cool, the only supernatural shit she really did was come up with this questionable idea of sending the four main characters east. Luckily god popped in at exactly the right time to detonate the nuke."

stephenking,2yflqu,DeepRoast,2,Tue Mar 10 12:47:16 2015 UTC,Huh. I've never heard anyone complain about the end of The Stand before.
stephenking,2yflqu,buddha8298,2,Tue Mar 10 15:15:12 2015 UTC,"Yes. I was incredibly disappointed with The Stand. I'm sure a lot of this was due to the fact that I had heard nothing about it besides how it is his greatest work and that it is a modern epic and all that. I've been a King fan for ten years at least, and after two failed attempts at reading The Stand over the past few years, I finally promised myself I would get through it and see what all the fuss was about. I finally powered through it and I was definitely let down.  There are certainly some cool parts (pretty much everything with Trashcan Man and The Kid, the weasels surrounding Mother Abigail, Larry going through the tunnel in NYC) and the overall concept is a winning one, but something is certainly missing. I did not feel as attached to the characters as I often do in his other books, such as those in IT or Dolores Claiborne or The Dark Tower, for example. Nick and Tom Cullen stand out, but that's about it as far as the main crew goes. And, after seeing so much of how Randall Flagg was truly terrifying from all of the character's dreams, I did not buy into Randall Flagg's character when we were shown him in person instead of via a dream or vision. He almost appeared to be clumsy, and certainly undeserving of his great power.  Also, was there an implicit connection between Randall Flagg and the plague? I don't recall reading about one if there was. Was he a product of the plague or was the plague a product of him. Just an unhappy coincidence that the two came to the Earth at the same time? Whatever the case, it wasn't made clear enough to me.  I think The Stand suffers the most from King's tendency to meander and overwrite out of any of his other books that I've read, save for Insomnia, perhaps. I agree, this book could have been half it's size at least and I don't think I would be missing much. It would be cool to get as much characterization as we do if I cared enough about any of the characters. None of them are strong enough to warrant the amount of attention that they receive.  The ending was a let down, as was the epilogue. Definitely an unnecessary addition that took away from main body of text in my eyes."

stephenking,2ydr6j,Will_I_Will_be,3,Sun Mar 8 22:56:24 2015 UTC,I don't know if it made it to the book (it's been a while) but it's weird that he describes the size of the desert with the word 'parsecs.' Something I'd associate with outer space.

stephenking,2ydr6j,spikestoker,2,Mon Mar 9 02:22:17 2015 UTC,"You only associate it with outer space because you watched Star Wars. If not you wouldn't have the association.  By the way King started writing these stories in 1970, so there is no connection between Star Wars and The Gunslinger."

stephenking,2y9chv,Saijar,37,Sat Mar 7 18:12:54 2015 UTC,I think it signifies Pennywise taking their childhood. They couldn't leave the sewers as children basically.

stephenking,2y9chv,hornwalker,19,Fri Mar 13 19:26:05 2015 UTC,"It weirded me out, but then again this book has a psychological ancient alien horror that feeds on peoples fears and then murders them painfully and gruesomely.  Yea child sex is definitely weird, but its always telling how people find sex to be so terribly compared to violence.  So we should really think about this-what's worse?  A young child being horrifically murdered or consensual sex between kids who have been forced to grow up very quickly?"
stephenking,2y9chv,PixelTreason,20,Sun Mar 8 00:42:51 2015 UTC,"I actually adored that scene. I first read ""IT"" when I was 13 and that scene didn't shock me. Instead it made an intuitive, logical kind of sense."
stephenking,2y9chv,tankandwank,19,Sat Mar 7 18:24:49 2015 UTC,"Instead it made an intuitive, logical kind of sense.       I couldn't agree with this more.      It was the ultimate consummation of their friendship.      Pennywise nearly bested them as individuals, but once they were literally united as one, they were able to overcome the insurmountable odds.      That's just my two cents. :)"

stephenking,2y9chv,PixelTreason,9,Sat Mar 7 18:53:05 2015 UTC,"Huh. You're so far from me that it's hard for me to even guess what your childhood experiences may have been like. And I may be an anomaly of course! For some reason I was a very sexual child and since people get really squicked out by the subject of children + sex (understandably so!) it's hard to know how common that really is in children.   When I got to that scene it was just like, ""Oh, of course! That makes perfect sense for Bev to use her own budding sexuality as a tool to wake them up, calm them down, grow them up in a ritual type fashion."" Not that I thought of it quite in those words."
stephenking,2y9chv,Vermifuge,5,Sat Mar 7 19:17:30 2015 UTC,Only on Reddit could a pre-teen gangbang be celebrated as adorable.
stephenking,2y9chv,PixelTreason,2,Wed Mar 11 05:54:39 2015 UTC,"Adoring something and thinking it's adorable  are two different things, no matter that they sound alike."
stephenking,2y9chv,chillbill69,17,Wed Mar 11 08:55:34 2015 UTC,"Again I have to say that King has stories about murder, child molestation, spousal abuse, child abuse, child death, people (and pets) coming back from the dead and performing cannibalism, basically every crime and perversion known to man yet the only thing that readers seem to be bothered by is the fact that some friends have consensual sex when they are underage."
stephenking,2y9chv,NiceDynamite999,12,Sun Mar 8 03:15:01 2015 UTC,"It was all about them each having fears, each one of the losers had one and Beverley's was sex. In all of the scenes with her father he makes euphemisms toward it. Even the whole name of the book and a colloquialism for the main villain is a word that kids use to describe sex 'IT'."
stephenking,2y9chv,m0llywobbles,6,Sun Mar 8 04:06:27 2015 UTC,"I thought it was perfect, honestly. I get why it gets a lot of flak, but it always just seemed to work to me."
stephenking,2y9chv,Rev_Jim_lgnatowski,6,Sat Mar 7 18:56:03 2015 UTC,"It's a book about fear and imagination. Most of what they live through are imaginations made real. That scene was an extension of that. In a group with only one girl, every boy in the group has imagined that."
stephenking,2y9chv,frostywit,14,Sun Mar 8 02:52:37 2015 UTC,"I first read the book at 12 or 13 and remember being really weirded or by that scene. It caught me off guard and stuck with me for a long time. It just didn't seem to really fit.  I reread the book 20 years later and now I can honestly say that it still creeps me the fuck out. I know it's supposed to symbolize much more, but I still have a hard time getting past the very literal preteen gang bang.  It's really representative of King's struggles with endings. I love Sai King, but many of his books seem to very slowly get off the ground (how often have you told someone ""You just have to get past xyz, then it gets really good""?), pick up speed ferociously about halfway through, and then sort of crumble toward the end."
stephenking,2y9chv,frostywit,6,Sat Mar 7 19:34:09 2015 UTC,Like The Stand.
stephenking,2y9chv,frostfromfire,3,Sat Mar 7 23:22:01 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The Stand is easily one of my favorite books, but its a beast to get through."
stephenking,2y9chv,Damien__,2,Sun Mar 8 00:00:03 2015 UTC,"I agree with you.  I understand what King was symbolizing with the scene, but there could have been a more fitting scene written that ties the kids together in adulthood.  No matter how consensual everything was, it doesn't seem like a genuine way of unification."
stephenking,2y9chv,Modest_Cake,2,Sun Mar 8 14:35:02 2015 UTC,It makes the reader uncomfortable so that all the scares he throws out there work better
stephenking,2y9chv,TheJessicaProblem,2,Sun Mar 8 01:21:06 2015 UTC,"I didn't even realize that is what happened until I finished the audiobook and then saw someone post about it on here. Blew my mind. I must not have been paying attention. Either way, I really liked the scene. The entire book was fantastic."
stephenking,2y9chv,brightshinies,2,Sun Mar 8 04:39:49 2015 UTC,"When I first read I was grossed out and it was pretty much my only criticism of the book whenever I talked about it with other fans. I mean I saw King's point but I felt the same way as you. ""Really, King? This is what you felt was necessary?""  As time went on though I digested it and actually grew to appreciate it. Bold move but once you see the act from a less ""ew, child sex"" perspective and more of the symbolism and....shit, what word am I looking for? Poignant?....aspect of it, it feels like that was the ultimate thing to do. Maybe there were alternatives but in the realm of the story that King was trying to tell in his own way, I certainly can't think of any alternatives.  Plus my opinions on sex in general have changed over the years so I can appreciate it. I hate it now when people try to say ""ohh that thing in that book or movie sends a bad message, it's in poor taste"" well, that's not supposed to be a blueprint for anybody,use your own judgement and spread it to your kids who wouldn't be reading IT in the first place anyway if you have legit concerns. Fiction isn't always the place where you have to form your idols and ideals.  The way I see it now, it wasn't sex for the sake of sex or a shock factor moment randomly thrown in(even though that's how I originally perceived it), or just objectifying Beverly because the patriarchy and yada yada feminism whatever.....it was something pure wrapped in this gross, offensive surface layer. Like this pizza box that I dropped in the mud the other day but with the internal contents remaining unsullied."
stephenking,2y9chv,spiralshadow,2,Sun Mar 15 19:55:55 2015 UTC,"It felt pretty unnecessary to me. Sort of taints what I, otherwise, think of as a pretty fantastic book. One of his best."
stephenking,2y9chv,Shashu,0,Sun Mar 8 01:28:32 2015 UTC,"I back this. Unnecessary and distasteful, he could have accomplished what he said he wanted to accomplish in a different way."

I just finished the book and then went straight to watching the mini series and thoroughly enjoyed both--except for that scene. I don't know if I can articulate why except to say that I was just disappointed more than anything. They were united with a common purpose and this act, I don't know, isolated her."
stephenking,2y9chv,Shashu,0,Fri Mar 13 21:06:07 2015 UTC,"It seemed kinda fucked up that her ""grand purpose"" was not only sexual, but something potentially traumatic. There's this unshakable hint of misogyny in that none of the other boys had to provide a similar function for the group, let alone a uniquely gendered sexual experience. I hope that makes sense."
stephenking,2y9chv,spiralshadow,1 point,Fri Mar 13 21:16:22 2015 UTC,"Exactly. She had been accepted and respected as a team member, transcending gender up until that point in the book. I don't think it lent itself to the plot either. I think it was included to titillate those readers who secretly expected/fantasized about it occurring as a natural consequence of boy/girl close interactions."

Their whole strength in the fight against It was their unity and bond, after they ""defeated"" It in 1958 that bond began to wear as soon as they were on the way out.  It was a way to get this bond back and it worked as soon as it was over, Eddie realised they had made a wrong turn a couple hundred yards back.  People who are disgusted by it - please get over it.   They were all the same age (no abusers here) It was consensual  It wasn't actually sleazy like a lot of people say - to me it was one of the most powerful scenes in the book - it was pure LOVE and total respect was there between them all. Oh yeah, it's fiction.   The modern world is paranoid about anything remotely resembling child sex abuse - but this is not it !!  SK has even said he would probably leave that scene out if he were to have written this book nowadays - which is more about political correctness then his actual views in my opinion."
stephenking,2y9chv,takesallkindsiguess,1 point,Wed Mar 18 20:49:18 2015 UTC,"I think whether you approve or disapprove of the scene it certainly adds an extra dimension  to the story and the cementing of the friendship beyond some sort of corny blood promise. I think what's interesting about the scene is how it's a rare moment where all the losers act instinctively without doubt and fear. There's no debate and very little is said about it before, during or after. So from that point of view its tonally very different than any other scene regardless of the specific content which I can understand might make some uncomfortable. It certainly took me aback when I first read it. Some have pointed out tat the book alludes to child abuse a lot but this stands out for being consensual among well established child characters."
stephenking,2y9chv,steviehendrix,1 point,Sat Mar 21 08:20:09 2015 UTC,"It seemed strange to me but pretty much everything that happened in the sewers both times seemed really far fetched and random. Why did the tactics they used harm It (Richie's voices, ""He thrusts his fists"", Stan's birds, etc) and why did all the boys having sex with Bev bring them together? They all loved each other so why didn't they just all have sex by that logic?   Also, I have an 11 year old stepdaughter and thinking about her being sexually active, let alone with 6 boys one after the other is seriously disturbing. 11 is still so young and immature. I think King even writing that is kinda creepy."
stephenking,2ya8fs,spacespaniel,19,Sat Mar 7 22:57:31 2015 UTC,"Start with book 2. Then after all of them, end with The Gunslinger. It works, you won't miss a thing. If you get 150 pages into book 2 and still aren't feeling it, pack 'em up."

stephenking,2ya8fs,heart_in_a_jar,5,Sun Mar 8 01:22:10 2015 UTC,"You can really tell that The Gunslinger was written by a young writer with a big idea that he didn't really understand. By Book 2, King had obviously learned a lot about epic storytellinig, especially after tackling The Talisman and The Stand. Drawing of the Three was definitely where it all came together for me."
stephenking,2ya8fs,Heisenberg82,3,Sun Mar 8 21:55:29 2015 UTC,"SPOILERS AHEAD:   This is interesting, I've never heard this advice before. I feel like reading book 2 first without even picking up book 1 could be a bad idea, though. I don't want to spoil anything, but what about that one line in book 1 that is completely integral to the entire meaning of the series' end and the lesson/moral of the series? The lesson being that life is a cycle, a wheel, and that the journey is always more crucial than the destination. I know that eventually book 1 would be read, but I think that reading it after finishing book 7 would take away from the cyclical aspect of the story. The first line of The Gunslinger and how the story ultimately winds up there in the end is the whole point! Simply reading book 1 after book 7 would be anti-climactic. You'd see the first line and go ""huh, that's interesting."" It simply wouldn't have the same effect."
stephenking,2ya8fs,teaqualizer,1 point,Sun Mar 8 21:55:17 2015 UTC,You'd have to wonder if that line would hold the same weight for someone reading the series now from start to finish rather than having to experience re reading the first four books for 20 years like many of did. I almost think if it as a series in two parts rather than 7.
stephenking,2ya8fs,sexquipoop69,2,Sat Mar 21 08:26:48 2015 UTC,"I started with book 2 because it's all I had at the time, went back and read book one after the third book haha.  Still worked.  Then I read the whole series again afterword."

stephenking,2ya8fs,iiRenity,8,Sun Mar 15 18:17:54 2015 UTC,"Book one is a bit tedious but it's short. It was easier to get through my second time.  But book two is so good you really need to read at least that. If you make it through that and aren't hooked, The Dark Tower isn't for you."
stephenking,2ya8fs,mrsteacozy,3,Sun Mar 8 03:31:45 2015 UTC,"I agree. The first time I read The Gunslinger I really didn't care for it. I put it down and a year later when I thought I might want to read The Drawing of the Three, I decided to reread The Gunslinger just in case I forgot any important details. The second read through was much more enjoyable, not sure why. The Drawing of the Three turned out to be good, but not amazing for me.  I'm almost 2/3rds through The Wastelands right now. It's a little weird, but interesting enough. It's definitely different than what I'm used to from King. I've been asking myself: ""Why are you still reading if you're not super excited about the series?"" And I think I'm with Eddie when I say that at this point I just need to see the Tower."
stephenking,2ya8fs,aikodude,4,Sun Mar 8 14:01:12 2015 UTC,"I kind of had to force myself through The Gunslinger. It was pretty dry at parts, but the story really picks up from the second book onwards. It gets so much better - keep chugging away at it!"

I read The Gunslinger first because Book 2 wasn't out yet, and at the time I was pretty much devouring everything SK had written. The Gunslinger got off to a pretty awesome start when he gunned down the entire town, but then I couldn't get into anything after that.  After finishing book 5 I think, I went back and re-read the Gunslinger, and I still couldn't get into it even after he shoots everyone in Tull.  I would read Book 2 and maybe find the Dark Tower companion or whatever it's called in a Barnes and Noble and just read the synopsis for book 1. I wouldn't buy the companion though. Just read it there."

I have the same problem and it never would have occurred to me to start with the second book.   I'm going to try it!  I've never not liked a SK book and it irked me to no end that The Gunslinger never did it for me.  I'm usually hooked by the end of the first paragraph.
stephenking,2ya8fs,Dohi64,2,Sun Mar 8 17:44:32 2015 UTC,"I'm reading DT right now, in the middle of The Waste Lands. I'm really enjoying it, but I tried and failed to start 3 times before it finally stuck. Fortunately the first book isn't that long, so you can just push through it. (Don't read right before bed, like I was trying to do). Don't be too concerned that you are missing something or not getting it. There's nothing to get or not get really. Stuff happens, you meet Roland, and there's a some world building, that's it. I really enjoyed The Gunslinger after I finished it. Make sure you have the updated version, it's easier to digest at least."
stephenking,2ya8fs,TheJessicaProblem,2,Wed Mar 11 16:10:16 2015 UTC,"not a fan either but it does get somewhat better. books 2 and 3 are ok, then 4 isn't (it's a flashback to pre-gunslinger times, pretty boring stuff), and that's where I stopped many years ago, so can't comment on the others but as I hear the rest isn't that great either. but of course it has a lot of fans, so you'll hear the other side as well (dt4 is considered a favorite among many readers). as big a king fan as I am, I don't even care about dt anymore, I'll read everything else he puts out eventually and probably won't pick up any dt story ever again. or I will and it'll blow my mind and I'll have to redeem myself."

stephenking,2y5pcf,kerel97,6,Fri Mar 6 18:12:08 2015 UTC,"I think that all of the things they used to fight it were just things that they, as children, believed in.  Eddies respirator was just water,  but he believed it helped his asthma, so it did.  Having a phrase he could say without stuttering made Bill feel more powerful,  and doing voices was kind of a defense mechanism for Richie. I think it's supposed to be sort of a counter to what It feeds off of,  the children It takes gives It the power with their fear,  because they believe in what their seeing. So the total faith in something positive was able to hurt It,  because it was opposite of the total faith that the scary things were real.  That's one girls interpretation anyways."
stephenking,2y5pcf,im_a_realgirl,1 point,Fri Mar 6 22:14:43 2015 UTC,"I think it's the accurate one, anyway. It seems like the text not only supports, but stops just shy of outright saying you're right."
stephenking,2y5pcf,GaijinSama,3,Fri Mar 6 23:00:04 2015 UTC,"IT is all about imagination, perception, and most importantly, control over one's will. Pennywise, as discussed, targets children not just because they are more susceptible to It's influence, but also because they feel more deeply and more quickly. For something that feeds on fear, children are prime targets because there is still so much that is unknown, mythical, and still possible. An adult has grown up, seen the world, and believes in less.  Ultimately, the ways the children fight back is a combination of overcoming their fears - silver hurts werewolves, thus if Pennywise is pretending to be a werewolf, silver must hurt it. It doesn't just take the shape, it becomes the thing. Pennywise used Bill's stutter and Eddie's asthma while mocking them and forcing upon them how weak and pathetic they were, drawing them away from the flock and the protection of their friends. A predator drawing off the sick and weak.  Eddie was told that his asthma medication worked because he (and his mother) believed it did, so declaring it acid made it so. Bill's mantra was how he controlled his stutter, and by taking control of his stutter he took that power back from Pennywise. However, just having a weapon doesn't make any of them invulnerable. A spear doesn't protect a hunter from a boar's tusks. As much as they began to remember the events of their childhood, and the power began to come back... they had grown into adults. Adults who no longer believed in the magic they once did, no longer knew how to fight werewolves and mummies. Think back to when you were young and believed beyond all doubt that there was a Santa Claus, or that the magician on stage could really cut someone in half. Once you've seen the trick, looked behind the curtain to the reality behind, the illusion can never fully return.  Someone like Henry, who's imagination was stunted and who's life was already so out of his control, was a perfect target for Pennywise to control, even more so as he aged, separated from the other adults who might have kept him grounded in reality, he was left with no one but himself and the moon for company, leaving Pennywise a way to influence him more strongly than the other adults in the town, who merely packed up and went inside instead of helping those in trouble.  Regarding Pennywise and his powers, remember what a dwarf once said: “Never forget what you are, for surely the world will not. Make it your strength. Then it can never be your weakness. Armour yourself in it, and it will never be used to hurt you.”"
stephenking,2y5pcf,chaospope,2,Fri Mar 27 04:43:27 2015 UTC,"My take on Richie is that him using the voices is a way of becoming like a child again, and using belief--this time belief in authority--against It.  Mr. Nell, who inspires the Irish Cop voice, is an authority figure in the life of the Losers. Richie channels that, and uses his imagination (which I think is the key to hurting It) to surprise and hurt It. After all, what adult would suddenly lapse into mimicry when scared and far down in the sewers?   For Bill and the koan, he believes that if he can just say it, his parents will stop at shutting him out and love him again. That's a childish thing to think, but powerful, and him overcoming his childhood fears helps him overcome It.   That's my ramblings on it, at least."
stephenking,2y5pcf,J_Strange,1 point,Fri Mar 6 21:14:15 2015 UTC,"Richie did use his voices later in life, though - in fact, he made his career out of it. So using his voice isn't really a throwback to his youth per se. Specifically the cop is, but your idea about authority wasn't really described in the book. But it's a good theory.  Good point about Bill too, there was this whole thing about his parents shutting him out and him wanting to overcome that.

stephenking,2y3syv,Moses_Scurry,1 point,Fri Mar 6 15:22:41 2015 UTC,"""All That You Love Will Be Carried Away"" is an awesome piece of writing.  But, I'm going to completely cop out and say that Everything's Eventual is cover-to-cover the greatest collection of King's short stories. ""The Lucky Quarter"" may be the weakest entry in the collection, but it is still classic King -- with characters that are fully fleshed out in a few dozen pages.   [SPOILERS BELOW: Everything's Eventual]  From ""1408"" to ""The Man in the Black Suit"" the stories are roller coasters of emotion, dangling the reader between excitement and utter dread. Stories like ""That Feeling, You Can Only Say What It Is in French,"" ""Lunch at the Gotham Café,"" and ""Autopsy Room Four"" all play on classic horror/sci-fi tropes but King brings his own flair to the setting and by the end comparing them to their tropes is like calling The Shining ""Another haunted house story.""  We get ""The Little Sisters of Eluria"" to tell us about a younger Roland. L.T.'s Theory of Pets gives the reader a chance to weave their own story into the world that King has created. ""Everything's Eventual"" and ""In the Deathroom"" offer stories that counter one another with a man who can control others in the former and a man who is captured and left with no control over his own life in the latter; in a delightful turn King leaves the man with the power of control trapped and the detainee free.  Finally, we get two stories about car chases. or car escapes really. ""The Road Virus Heads North"" is about a man who is trying to outrun the inevitable. Lay this story along side ""Riding the Bullet,"" here we have the opposite of ""Road Virus"" and the protagonist is being tested and confront his own mortality in a completely different way than in ""Road Virus;"" he's not being chased by anything but his own guilt. This time our protagonist is not powerless, instead he must choose who dies."

stephenking,2y38a7,JLSaun,1 point,Sat Mar 7 02:40:06 2015 UTC,"I think you are going to see more ""about to read this"" posts for these books because newer King readers are more likely to post something like that and a newer reader is more likely to start with one that they have heard of before.

stephenking,2y1xmz,RobertPaulsen39,1 point,Thu Mar 5 21:48:35 2015 UTC,Yep! The actor practically has turned into him what with doing voices for Family Guy and producing Robot Chicken. I thought it was a good idea.
stephenking,2y1xmz,RobertPaulsen39,1 point,Fri Mar 6 06:33:38 2015 UTC,"I made this initially around last year with just the kids, the adult kids, IT, and the parents. Then I became inspired by u/Strider_Diaz post on superheroes to include a larger cast of what could make this a great miniseries and made a lot of additions and removals before becoming confident enough to show you guys. Like I said, I initially made this about a year ago so I understand that the child actors I chose have aged a bit, and I think Robert Capron ditched his weight but I could seriously not think of anybody else other than the kid from Bad Santa who is in his 20's now.  If I had it my way, everything from the book would be on screen. Maybe change the child orgy to just a kiss instead. But to do so, it would have to be multiple seasons, 7-12 episodes per season, 1 season per part. I would also change the timeline, make the before period in the 70's instead of the 50's and make the now period in the early 2000's.  Go ahead and feel free to say what you think!"
stephenking,2y1xmz,davis98,1 point,Thu Mar 5 19:48:36 2015 UTC,"I really liked the book, but I thought a lot of dialogue and situations of the kids fucking around in the barrens was a bit repetitive; they discuss something serious, Richie says something in one of his voices and they all laugh. That's a template that's in there a lot, and cutting that out would really shorten the book.  I think cutting it into two movies, but just one for the children and one for the adults instead of the nonlinear approach in the book would be doable. The book is long, but stuff like what I just mentioned really bloats it up. Taking out crucial story points, and maybe deciding to cut something or leave it in (stuff mentioned in the interludes, for example), should make a fine script.  Definitely leave the sex scene out, though. I don't think anyone has ever been positive about that.  I'm hoping the ending will be similar to the book, with Bill flying to the deadlights and all that, and the spider's lair being like this green lit cathedral hall like it was described. So epic.  Edit: also, putting the adults in the 2000's wouldn't work as well because the use of cellphones would make the situation of being lost in the sewers unrealistic."
stephenking,2y1xmz,RobertPaulsen39,1 point,Thu Mar 5 19:53:16 2015 UTC,"IMO, not all of Richie's voices need to be done. There were some that did not seem funny at all.  I think the Mike subplot of investigating the dark history was a great part of the book. I enjoyed both The Bradley shootout and the Silver Dollar massacre. I think The Black Spot should be added too, I would appreciate seeing a younger Dick Hallorran on screen. I also think the Adrian Mellon murder is a great way to reintroduce IT back into Derry.  Agree with the ending.  Remember our smartphones weren't developed until 07. So in 04/05 they'd still have flip phones and blackberrys, that didn't have GPS , didn't have flashlight apps, and ran out of signal frequently, especially underground. My problem with doing it in the 80's again is, we've done it once before, and the younger audience can't identify with the 80's like we could when the original movie came out."

stephenking,2xz1qz,pinkmankid,2,Thu Mar 5 05:34:44 2015 UTC,"I agree. It was very creative but it did have the tendency to be a bit boring at times. Although I've got to say the parts with the Space Cowboy gave me chills. I also thought the ending was creepy and well-done.  It will be interesting to see how they turn that whole narrative into a movie, especially since most of what went on were all in Jessie's head. The director Mike Flanagan seems to be really excited about this project and he has done well in psychological horror films in the past. I think it's going to be cool."

Kind of a nice change :)  I can't say I know much of his work (I'll definitely check him out now) but I'll see the movie, I'm sure, regardless.   That was my concern as well, so much of it takes place inside someone's head and conveying that to film seems difficult. It's so subjective and open for interpretation that it seems like it can crumble quickly if not handled with care, so I guess we'll have to see!"

He can pull off the character's layers of creepiness and fear."
stephenking,2xvys2,RadamWilson,0,Wed Apr 8 08:08:41 2015 UTC,"Well since we're all playing the speculation game, I can think of why changing one factor of the story (time setting) would require also changing another factor, names. If you're not going to set it in the 50s for whatever reason, then you're not going to have a character named Beverly since that's a fairly dated name."

stephenking,2xwoba,Mafuckma_Gandhi,2,Wed Mar 4 14:11:24 2015 UTC,"So it wasn't Columbine that caused him to take it off the shelves, but it was a school shooting. Some kid in Kentucky shot up his school and they found Rage in the locker, and King himself decided that it wasn't something that they needed to keep in print.  There were other school shootings, but it was the Kentucky shooting that was the final straw.  For my part, Rage was well written but it never really clicked with me.  The entire time I was reading it I just felt like it was his version of Lord of the Flies.  I don't know what his inspiration was, though it was written in 1977 which I believe was the around the time his drug addiction was pretty bad.  Other than that, I don't know.  All the interviews I can find surrounding the book involve it being taken out of publication, and not about why it was written."

stephenking,2xwoba,acassese,1 point,Thu Mar 5 00:38:31 2015 UTC,"Rage is the only king book out of print. A 1st edition can run anywhere from $150 to $1000 because of this. When Columbine happened King felt the story was too similar and he didn't want people to be influenced by the book to do similar things so he requested it be taken out of print. With that being said you can still get copies of the Bachman books(which contains Rage) pretty easily, at least in paperback form"

I remember I'd be reading it and songs King mentioned would come on the radio and I'd be slightly freaked out.  I enjoyed it until he broke my heart at the end, not wanting to ruin it for anyone, but I actually cried a few times while reading and after.  I felt like I needed a support group."

With time travel, magic, westerns, huge literature throwbacks, good vs evil and huge battles with American small town life mixed in.   The Gunslinger is desert. Get through it - the payoff and the journey is worth it."

stephenking,2xw8z5,teaqualizer,1 point,Thu Mar 5 04:11:54 2015 UTC,"I inadvertently read book 4 before i started the series proper so I'm not really sure how it would feel to read the gunslinger from scratch without any reference to the world. Not sure if i robbed myself of the experience or have myself an easier entry into the series. Starting with Blaine was definitely a different gear than starting with Roland in the desert. Either way as others have said it's a sprawling universe taking in many environments and genres. I would argue that if you're not in by the end of book 2 then it's probably not a series for you.... Still can't believe that King wrote all those other books and then the dark tower on top of that. I just get physically drained even thinking about the effort that must have went into writing it.. unless of course he had access to Gan's navel, the anabolic steroids of the writing world"

stephenking,2xuxt9,SquadLeaderRivalle,3,Wed Mar 4 03:24:41 2015 UTC,If you've never read anything by him I would suggest The Shining first as it's a pretty scary read the 1st time and will whet your appetite before delving into his thicker works like It or the Dark Tower series. Or I might also suggest one of his collections. Different Seasons was my first King experience and the 4 stories in it give a good taste of the different kinds of tales he can tell.
stephenking,2xuxt9,TheDanimal438,2,Wed Mar 4 02:31:01 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't try the Tower series first-it's pretty different from his other stuff.  It, The Stand, The Shining, Salem's Lot, or Skeleton Crew would all be good places to start."

stephenking,2xtecy,SilentRanger,1 point,Tue Mar 3 23:31:38 2015 UTC,"Have you read Lovecraft? Haha. He's one of my favorites but he's far beyond your garden variety racist. When characters in your stories have black cats named ""Nigger-Man"" and most evil things come back to tribal ""voodoo"" blacks (for example: the first group discovered from the Cthulhu cult) and most main characters are not just white but aristocratic you know you're a special kind of racist. To top it all off there is just a general air of distain for non-whites in most cases. Don't get me wrong he's a great writer but Hitler was a great speaker too and he was kind of a dick (sorry for the extreme comparison, first thing that came to mind). Every once in a while I have to just put one of his stories down for a while because of it."

stephenking,2xine3,elzilcho13,2,Sun Mar 1 01:21:42 2015 UTC,"Lyrics-:  He stole Mrs. Hearst and drove her mad  He's tall and dark and leather clad  He's the man your mother warned you about  He's got his klan robes tucked away  He walks at night and sleeps at day  So on the roads keep both eyes out  They'll tell you that the devil ain't real  That he can't change how you think and feel  Cus he is just inside your mind  Tell that to the man in the looney bin  That there ain't no harm in his evil grin  But are the madmen really blind  Man's got his reasons for heaven and hell  The Glory of God and The Devil as well  And the big horned beast upon his throne  Sometimes the world seems grey and grey  But wait for the fog to clear today  and black and white shall be your home  Tell me I belong in a looney bin  Been there 20 years and I fit right in  Cus every man has felt it right here  It's the big black darkness looming in  It's the coated figure with his evil grin  It's the man that even brave men fear  He'll promise riches and good health  He'll promise union with the self  And hand you all the finest wine and food  He'll let you outta your dingy cell  And put you on the train to hell  And he goes by the name...  The Walkin' Dude  There's a sweet old lady in her yard  Singin songs like she is God's own bard  She brightens up your mind, thoughts and mood  But for every good there is a bad  We've had, are having and will have  A man who calls himself...

stephenking,2xdvwe,zimprop,6,Fri Feb 27 19:46:15 2015 UTC,"Well, the door would have to be pretty messed up to miss the mark by that much time AND distance.  Personally I think the yellow/black card man is more like Clotho and Lachesis from Insomnia.  An agent that exists outside of our dimension..."
stephenking,2xdvwe,boomboom68,3,Fri Feb 27 23:41:26 2015 UTC,"True, the door IS to 1958, not 1963..."
stephenking,2xdvwe,gammanaut,2,Fri Feb 27 23:42:59 2015 UTC,True that the door would have to mess up pretty badly for it to be off by 5 years. It may still be a door by the old people. Mayhaps it does still allow for Chronos to be the Guardian/ the yellow card man.
stephenking,2xdvwe,steeljaw,2,Sat Feb 28 00:10:27 2015 UTC,"I agree with the Clotho / Lachesis theory. Remember that when Jake / George finally speaks to the yellow card man he says something along the lines of ""We have to maintain all the threads (possible outcomes) of time in our minds. It's not a huge deviation when your buddy comes back to get some ground beef, but when you start altering the course of history in a major way it makes it extremely difficult for us to hold the threads without it breaking our minds""..  So in my opinion, the yellow card man is there to make sure that this accidental 'wormhole' doesn't end up altering the future so dramatically.  He's a guardian, but he's not allowed to physically interfere with Jake / George, so he can only try to persuade him to make the right choice OR try his hardest to keep space / time from collapsing on itself if history and the future do become dramatically altered.."
stephenking,2xdvwe,gammanaut,4,Sat Feb 28 05:39:07 2015 UTC,I really dig this theory...where do you think the yellowcard man fits in with the tower mythos? Was he a tour guide from Fedic perhaps?
stephenking,2xdvwe,Hydrochloric,2,Fri Feb 27 20:39:07 2015 UTC,Hmm a tour guide of some sort. That's a really good theory. Although during all the times in the dark tower series that the doors were travelled through the only sentient commonality they ever found at each end was some form of robot.
stephenking,2xdvwe,Damien__,3,Sat Feb 28 00:13:50 2015 UTC,The only surviving guides at the doors are robots. It has been quite awhile.
stephenking,2xdvwe,JakInTheIE,3,Sat Feb 28 01:56:51 2015 UTC,"The doors under Fedic were built by people (North Central Positronics) before the world moved on.   But there were Magic doors as well, beach doors, doorway cave.  My feeling is that the door in the book 11/22/63 is a magic door and unrelated to the NCP built doors. This would make the door marked 11/22/63 under Fedic simply a destination door for their admittedly morbid tourism."
stephenking,2xdvwe,WordSlinger1812,2,Sat Feb 28 13:51:00 2015 UTC,"Nice theory. There's one problem though, there is absolutely zero geographical shift. You come out in the same exact place, just at a different time. I guess that could be a malfunction on its own. Like the time portion degraded slightly by five years and the geographical portion broke completely.  Perhaps the yellowcard man is sort of a maintenance guy, watching the door until it gets fixed. Seems like he should have had a weapon of some sort to prevent people from messing with the time/space continuum.  That brings up another interesting point. How did all those doorways not fuck with time? Surely someone would have done something to mess things up at some point."

So I guess there's no definitive saying that one book isn't worth the time? Everybody's got different things they like or dislike in a book.  With that said, the only Stephen King book I've ever hated was Mr. Mercedes. I don't even plan on reading the next in that trilogy.

I once read the entire Dark Tower series over Christmas Break, for example.  To date Mr. Mercedes is only book of his I wasn't interested in finishing...I kept setting it aside and reading other stuff, until I finally wrapped it up after like three months. Dull, uninteresting plot, the villain was just a loser(er) version of Harold Lauder from The Stand and it was obvious how it would end.

I have also found many of his books since ~2003 or so to be quite lacking, to the extent that I stopped reading... which is really saying something because I'm a huge fan of his earlier work. I feel like he's trying too hard a lot of the time -- there is little subtlety and too much of an attempt to connect things to the Dark Tower universe. I found it really amazing when I first started noticing those small connections, but when it starts to be the norm, it's just disappointing, in my opinion.

Agree heavily that his stuff from the last decade (maybe longer) has been very lackluster compared to his older stuff, however I've noticed in this sub that many people have directly opposite opinions.

stephenking,2xayjg,Elphie_819,3,Fri Feb 27 06:20:30 2015 UTC,Lisey's Story is in my top 20 books of all time. It seems to be an oddly polarizing one among King fans though. Not really sure why though - not traditional horror enough?  I'm not a huge fan of Dreamcatcher. No specific reason - just feel like King has done aliens a few too many times at this point.
stephenking,2xayjg,domdest,4,Fri Feb 27 04:48:05 2015 UTC,"If I recall correctly, King said in an AMA last year that Lisey's Story was his favorite."

You'll only be able to see Sissy Spacek, et al as the characters. King's description of Carrie was quite different than the portrayal in the movie as I recall.  I would still read it though. It's not like it will take you long. It's one of his shortest books. I'd be more inclined to recommend reading something that you haven't already seen the movie."
stephenking,2x8lok,Moses_Scurry,5,Thu Feb 26 16:34:55 2015 UTC,"Serious question here... Not being rude.  Can you think of an example of a movie that was as good as or better than the book? Not talking about limiting it to SK, but I mean, in the entire history of film, can you come up with one?  I only ask this question because it's one I asked myself when I had a question like yours. It made me realize that no matter how much I love a movie, the book's always better. And if I REALLY love a book, it's usually better to leave the movie unwatched, or at least go into the movie with no expectations of epic-ness.  The one film series that I think comes anywhere close to rivaling the books is the LOTR series. That being said, I still think the books are better. But much love for Peter Jackson & his merry band of actors & film crew.  Edit: Thank you, Reddit, you've opened my eyes a little bit & suggested some great movies to checkout or rewatch.

Novel Annie seemed to be near self destruction regardless of Paul's arrival, whereas film Annie was fully functional but obviously a little off"
stephenking,2x8lok,FortBalsac,3,Fri Feb 27 18:26:00 2015 UTC,IMO Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is so much better than the book. But it's way different than the book and pissed the author and his family off. Gene Wilder's portrayal is one of my favorite movie characters.

stephenking,2x8lok,veganchaos,3,Thu Feb 26 17:07:18 2015 UTC,"I've loved King's novella ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"" since first reading it in DIFFERENT SEASONS in the '80s, and Darabont's film comes very close to equaling the impact of the novella.  Darabont's adapation of the ""Green Mile"" also captures a great deal of what made King's serial novel so powerful and moving. The sheer length of the film allowed Darabont to explore most of the book's themes and subplots to great effect, and the film packs an emotional punch at the end that almost exceeds the book's ending.  Rob Reiner's ""Stand by Me,"" while not as rich or layered as King's novella ""The Body,"" is still an amazingly faithful adaption, The haze of wistful nostalgia that hangs over the film is identical to the feelings evoked by the novella. Also, Reiner was smart enough to use King's actual prose verbatim in the voice-overs.  So, yeah, those three films are almost as good as the books on which they were based."

stephenking,2x8lok,earlubes,1 point,Mon Mar 2 06:57:18 2015 UTC,"Having never seen the movie, I would still say that you should absolutely read the book. Carrie is a phenomenal read, and I'm willing to be that it is quite a bit better than the movie."
stephenking,2x8lok,chillbill69,1 point,Mon Mar 2 19:01:29 2015 UTC,"The book is amazing and so much better told than any of the movies. The movies don't resemble the book very well. However the 1976 version in my opinion is the only movie that seems to bring some of the book to life. Usually it's better to read Carrie before seeing any of the movies, but personally that's just me."
stephenking,2x5945,SpookyGeek,15,Wed Feb 25 19:42:20 2015 UTC,"I saw King give a talk once, in San Francisco.  He was taking questions from the audience and someone asked him what it was like adjusting to fame, and he said some stuff I don't recall precisely about how it was nice to be recognized and sometimes it made life easier.   At that moment, the nutjob in question stood up and yelled, ""You killed John Lennon and I have proof!""  Without missing a beat, King went on to say ""On the other hand ..."" and trailed off as the entire audience laughed and applauded.  At the time (late '80s or early '90s) this nutjob was frequently seen on the streets of SF in his prior vehicle, which was decorated like his new one shown in the link. I haven't seen him for a while and I guess I assumed he finally got treatment; apparently not."

stephenking,2x6nwx,WhiskeyLord69,8,Thu Feb 26 01:56:49 2015 UTC,"I'll give you a rundown of some of his works. Pick whatever suits your fancy, since Stephen King is that kinda author.  The Stand (My recommendation) - Society crumbles to a plague killing 99.4 of humanity. In the resulting purgatory two colonies form: One led by the matronly old Mother Abigale, the other by the pure-evil sorceror Randall Flagg. The two settlements battle one another in a deeply religious battle between good and evil. The main characters are the blue-collar Texan Stu Redman, the pregnant college student Frannie Goldsmith, the newly ascended Rockstar Larry Underwood, and the mute drifter Nick Andros. It's very slow and the unabridged version is 1100 pages. However, it's excellent.   The Shining - Troubled writer Jack Torrence brings his wife and son with him to watch over a hotel. The house possesses him and he goes murderously crazy.  Misery - A writer is held captive by a crazy fan.   'Salem's Lot - A writer and a priest fight vampires.  Carrie - An socially outcast teenage girl gains psychic powers, to the misfortune of her tormentors.  IT - A dual narrative: A group of friends as children and as adults (back to back) fight against a shapeshifting monster dressed often as a clown. King is so afraid of the monster (named only It) that he is too scared to write a sequel.  11/22/63 - A recent and well acclaimed novel. It's about a man who tries to go back in time to prevent Kennedy's assassination.  Under The Dome - A small town is trapped in by a dome. The town goes nuts.  The Dead Zone - A man gains the power of future vision, and uses it to try and kill an evil politician.  The Long Walk - (By his pseudonym, Richard Bachman) A dystopian future where children compete in a competition to see who can walk the longest. The winner gets one wish. You might like it because of your recent readings (1984, Brave New World)  Cujo - A rabid dog.  The Gunslinger (I wouldn't recommend it unless you were wanting to get into a series) - A rather poorly written and overall mediocre novel that is the start to The Dark Tower, whose second third and fourth novels are fantastic.  Gerald's Game - A woman and her husband go up to a secluded cabin and, to spice up their sex life, handcuff the woman to the bedpost. The man then dies, leaving the woman handcuffed and completely unable to escape. She goes nuts.  Cell - Humanity is ravaged by a disease wherein they go violently crazy, caused by cell phones. A graphic novelist tries to reunite with his son in the resulting chaos.  Rose Madder - A woman escapes from her abusive relationship with her husband. The husband begins to track her down, and there's some supernatural shit.  Eyes of the Dragon - Basically a high fantasy novel. Same villain as The Stand.  The Talisman - A joint effort with Peter Straub. A world where everyone has a twin in the alternate dimension. One boy's twin dies, and thus he can travel back and forth.  There's more, but these are quite a few. Pick whatever's interesting. I recommend The Stand because it's fantastic."
stephenking,2x6nwx,Nichase,4,Thu Feb 26 02:21:25 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for the rundown. So far, I think that The Running Man, The Dead Zone, and 11-22-63 look like the ones I'm most interested in. I read a chapter or two of the Gunslinger, but it was a PDF on my tablet and I HATE reading ebooks, I absolutely refuse to read any other format than old fashioned, physical hard copies of books.   I really appreciate your input, though. I'll put those three on my list and once I finish the book I'm currently on, I'll definitely order one of them courtesy of Amazon Prime. I can't wait."
stephenking,2x6nwx,the_monkeys,4,Thu Feb 26 03:02:28 2015 UTC,"Don't miss out on IT , it is an amazing read, I've never read such good character development and I actually felt sad finishing the book - like I lost some friends.   Top top book ."

stephenking,2x6nwx,non_clever_username,3,Sun Mar 1 16:57:06 2015 UTC,"The Running Man is way better than the movie.   You'll like it I think.  After reading the book,  I'm a little annoyed at how the movie is like one big WWF match with some running in between."
stephenking,2x6nwx,rosconotorigina,2,Thu Feb 26 13:51:06 2015 UTC,"I recommend waiting on The Gunslinger and the rest of the Dark Tower series until you've read more of his other books anyway. There are lots of little connections and while they're not anything you absolutely need to recognize to enjoy the story, it makes it that much more fun to read when you can pick them out."
stephenking,2x6nwx,PG3124,1 point,Thu Feb 26 14:41:18 2015 UTC,The running man really is amazing. Its one of my top 3 from King just because of how gripping it is from start to finish. If you like it read The Long Walk it would be right up your alley.
stephenking,2x6nwx,handawanda,3,Thu Feb 26 14:56:07 2015 UTC,"I join your recommendation of The Stand -- but I totally disagree that The Stand is slow. Sprawling and epic, yes. But for an 1100+ page book, I think it flies by."
stephenking,2x6nwx,Karma_Gardener,3,Thu Feb 26 13:27:51 2015 UTC,"Start with The Shining.  It is pure, raw early King."
stephenking,2x6nwx,religion_idiotizes,1 point,Thu Feb 26 10:52:35 2015 UTC,"^ I agree. It's very different from Kubrick's movie, and while I appreciate the movie in its own right, you really don't know this story until you've read the novel. I've read many of King's novels and stories, and The Shining might still be my favorite.  Also recommend Pet Sematary (also well above and beyond the movie) for something extremely creepy, and get to the Dark Tower eventually, but don't start there.  Ka is a wheel, and you'll get there eventually anyhow ;)"

stephenking,2x2reh,Nichase,5,Wed Feb 25 05:35:04 2015 UTC,Gunslinger was a mediocre novel. Drawing of the Three was a fantastic novel.
stephenking,2x2reh,domdest,5,Wed Feb 25 05:36:04 2015 UTC,"I only ever ask people to stick it out until the end of book 2. Which I know you might ask ""if a series takes two books to get good is it really a good series?"" and I would answer emphatically ""yes"". Book 1 was written very early in King's career and it's a bit dry and pretentious - King, it seemed, learned humility after college. However, it serves the purpose of introducing Roland, showing you that he's serious business, and making you dislike him a little."
stephenking,2x2reh,domdest,2,Wed Feb 25 13:38:32 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean by his writing being ""pretentious"". I have a decent vocabulary I believe; however, there was a lot of words he used that went right over my head.   Now that I am reading Drawing of the Three, his prose is far more concise and simplistic. I am enjoying the read thus far."

He had to clean up this little paper things, which he learned were tampons. This surprised him, that the girls would have their periods in front of each other. So he pictured a girl having her first period in public and freaking out, while everyone else laughed at her. And then, with his special mind, pictured the girl going apeshit and killing everyone with psychic powers. He started it and threw it away, but his wife took it out of the trash and told him it had potential. When he published it it sold like 400 000 copies by the time he got the first sales report (or something like that)."

Richard Chizmar, editor of Cemetery Dance, is reading though the entire catalog and posting really in depth analysis and history of each book as he goes along. He's currently on The Stand. I'm doing the same thing but am currently on Danse Macabre."
stephenking,2x1y0c,jon_slush,1 point,Wed Feb 25 21:49:40 2015 UTC,"It's funny you mention that. I actually found this series from The Guardian. However, I'm really glad you posted this, but for a different reason.  I love that in the recent re-releases of King's books, a lot of them actually have introductions written by him. I have the Pocket Books edition of Carrie, and I just loved reading his inspiration. It's much more vivid and insightful than the drab ""inspirations"" tab you find on stephenking.com. So, the reason I'm glad you posted that is that I like the idea of these historical context essays. My copy of Carrie is back at my parents' house, so I'm doing this trek through the library's catalog, and most of them do not include those introductions written by King, so these will do.  If you happen to know of a website where I actually can read those introductions, I would love you forever. Trust me, I have checked every book site that offers previews, and either they cut them out in the preview or the editions they have available for preview don't include the introductions. It's sad, really. I love reading those as much as I loved reading the story."
stephenking,2x1y0c,jon_slush,1 point,Thu Feb 26 01:55:29 2015 UTC,"Chizmar has a pretty close relationship with King so a lot of the historical stuff is coming straight from the source. If you're looking for the most recent intros to his books (without buying them new), you could look in to checking out ebooks from your local library through Overdrive. I've been getting the majority of my King books through this method and you are actually able to download/read the Kindle ebook straight from Amazon. It's always the latest edition so you know your getting the most up to date intro."

Those mentally unstable enough to act on words in a piece of fiction were mentally unstable enough to act on them no matter the media."

The Stand is specifically referenced in Wizard and Glass, but not in a way that really matters beyond being pretty cool. The Stand is an amazing novel and you should read it when you can devote yourself to it, not when you're itching for the next Tower book. Finish the Tower, then read The Stand."
stephenking,2x14go,Berjiwhir,2,Tue Feb 24 23:50:45 2015 UTC,"I agree with this 100%!  It would take away from the momentum you've got going with The Dark Tower and really doesn't add all that much to the experience. As a matter of fact, when you complete the series you will be dying for any Tower related content, so it will be awesome for you to have The Stand to scratch that itch!!"
stephenking,2x14go,steeljaw,3,Wed Feb 25 08:25:23 2015 UTC,"The Stand was one of the first King books I read, many years before I read the Dark Tower series. I honestly didn't know people recommended a ""reading order.""  The Stand remains one of my favorite books of all time, and the Dark Tower series my favorite series. Book order didn't effect that for me. Read it whenever you are ready for a fantastic book."
stephenking,2x14go,spookcomix,1 point,Tue Feb 24 22:39:02 2015 UTC,I read it years before starting TDT series.  I would say just read it when you want.  One of my favorites though.

stephenking,2x14go,shroedingerscook,1 point,Wed Feb 25 01:52:34 2015 UTC,"Just read it whenever.   While a bit of the stand is mentioned in the dark tower series, it's so little and so broad that you could have read the stand 20 years ago and gotten the references."
stephenking,2x14go,Jayviar,1 point,Wed Feb 25 03:56:44 2015 UTC,The Stand should be the first king book you ever read.

stephenking,2wzlty,Maester2chainz,7,Tue Feb 24 13:56:56 2015 UTC,"(No spoilers)  The only one you should read for color before The Dark Tower is Hearts in Atlantis (first story).   You can read DT two and three without anything else. Read The Stand before DT 4. You can read DT 4.5 here or after the series, your choice.  Read The Talisman, Black House, Salem's Lot, and Everything's Eventual before DT 5. Then 6 and 7.  I've probably missed some, but this order will have you reading the DT books after you get their morsels in the other King novels."
stephenking,2wzlty,chefsinblack,6,Tue Feb 24 14:06:18 2015 UTC,I would say that Insomnia would be included as well in regards to PD.

Most of my top 10 stories are in Skeleton Crew. Nightmares and Dreamscapes was very good. I'll go back and read the story with the dead rock stars every once in awhile. I did not care for Everything's Eventual. It seemed like every story ended too abruptly. He took the whole idea of the reader using their imagination for what happens next a little too far.

stephenking,2wq7p9,crow_road,4,Sun Feb 22 11:10:27 2015 UTC,Definitely the dark tower series. It's incredible and ties in with most of his other books - it has a lot to do with the Stand - so I'd read it as soon as possible.

Or you could randomly go to the baseball games he likes with one of his books in tow and hope you run into him one afternoon.  Unless you stumble upon a signed book at a yard sale or used book lot (super unlikely but who knows) you're going to be paying a few hundred dollars for his less popular signed books and a few thousand for his fan favorites."

stephenking,2woya2,frostfromfire,3,Sun Feb 22 13:54:03 2015 UTC,"Oh, gotcha. You'd be surprised what people do though. I live in sarasota, king has a house in the area, so people do get crazy sometimes.   I personally always go to the Barnes and Noble closest to his house (its also closest to my work, so it's not that stalkery) on release day of his new books in hopes he will be there, but I'd never chase him down.   My gf used to work at a movie theater and has had people stalk the theater when certain new horror movies come out hoping to run into him, she even had to fire a few employees for bothering him in the theater while a movie was playing.  I certainly wouldn't be surprised if people did hunt him down at baseball games or whatever"

I could have gone back year after year, but I didn't want to be disrespectful.  It's disgusting that people feel like they have a right to someone's personal and private space just because they're famous.  I can imagine King getting new release movies sent directly to his house to avoid situations at the theater like you mentioned."

You can take acetaminophen for something like a headache or a backache occasionally and you can drink occasionally and you can do both. But you can't do both very often. Honestly, doing either one daily is not good for you and it's possible you will damage your liver. But if you go out your celebrate something every once in awhile and take a couple of excedrin or Tylenol the next morning for a headache, you'll be fine. Liver damage usually happens over a period of time, not instantly because you drank too much and took one dose of acetaminophen one time."

The tricky part is taking a drink and swallowing without flooding your mouth with water- that defeats the purpose. But I am also an aspirin/acetaminophen/caffeine mix junkie so I've got this perfected, lol."
stephenking,2wmibq,mommy2libras,2,Sat Feb 21 22:39:00 2015 UTC,"I've been chewing aspirin since I was a kid. I used to get horrible sinus infections and I'd be treated for them but while this was happening, I still had killer headaches. I was about 9 or 10 when my mom started giving me regular aspirin instead of baby aspirin but she never told me I wasn't supposed to chew it like baby aspirin. I didn't find out til I was 12 or so. I'd had another infection and was crying because my head hurt so much. Mom said ""I don't know what else to do, if you'd just take an aspirin it might help"" but I kept refusing. She finally asked why and I said because it tasted so nasty. That's when she made the connection.  But now I just take Goody's powders. It's the same thing, just already in powder form. It works faster and better for me. For a raging hangover, you need a Goody's powder and a 5 hr energy (I guess all those B vitamins really help). Take the powder with water and then drink just half of the energy shot. You should feel miles better in about 15-20 minutes. After awhile, drink the other half of the energy shot if you feel you need to. I swear, by this method. It works quick and has never failed me and I don't have to force down food I might vomit back up and make me feel worse."

I can't really think of a character - I enjoy the ones he's already written SO much. Perhaps some more old-people style, like he did in Insomnia?   What i'd really like is to see existing characters; Carried on a little further - Jake Epping (11.22.63), for eg. Danny Torrence, (Shining) all grown up.

It'd be awesome to see the house as a character, as the antagonist, driving some solitary man insane. But with no supernatural explanation; just like in real life, when the house, perfectly normal in the daytime, seems to have an evil side at night…….it could work nicely as a short story, maybe. But it's tough to do that without being cliche; there are lots of haunted house stories out there….."

If the former, The Stand, IT, and The Shining are probably his most well-known novels and arguably have the biggest footprint in King-related zeitgeist. The Shining was adapted into a classic movie, as were Carrie and Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, which in my mind makes them fairly influential.  If the latter, I'd say any smattering of classic Lovecraft, Richard Matheson, and Poe stories. Plus some Lord of the Rings and maybe Dracula."

I imagine the Roland we read about was far more compassionate and caring than previous incarnations.  He went from someone who might have refused to let Susannah leave when she decided she wanted out, to someone who didn't just let her go but wept for her afterward.  Who tried to protect Jake at the end and would have sacrificed himself for his son had his hip not betrayed him, as opposed to someone who might have moved a little slowly on purpose so that Jake could take the hit.

He is carrying the world on his back and as long as he keeps up his journey the world will keep spinning whether for good or ill.  Every time he reaches the tower he has a little more compassion, and love.  This time he got the Horn and i find this extremely significant, instead of leaving it on the field with Burt he picks it up, and maybe when he blows the horn on top of the tower, the turtle will come back and all will be well.

If you are after palette palate cleanser to clear your mind of King, I recommend Richard Laymon or Brian Lumley. Can't get enough of either of these guys. Lumley's Necroscope Saga is my personal all time favourite series, trumping The Dark Tower, LOTR and ASOIAF.  Edit: If you try and research Necroscope, avoid the wiki at all cost.

I read it again when I was 21 or 22, I think, and while it was a different experience for me, it brought back so much of my childhood that I don't think reading it for the first time as an adult is the same as reading it as a child. It's a whole other world. I've never seen the entire movie, either, so the images I have in my head of the stories and places in Derry are mine alone, and they're the pictures I had as a child. Reading it as an adult only brought more definition and color and exactness to those childhood images.  It is my favorite book of all time. It always makes me happy when people post on this subreddit that they've read it for the first time."
stephenking,2w30ru,mangarooboo,2,Mon Feb 16 20:33:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah it really is fantastic. I think it's my favorite King novel I've read so far. The Stand was fantastic and the Dark Tower series was amazing but this was the book and story that has just seemed the most solid so far. I mean, there are some things that could have been improved a tiny bit but those are just small personal preferences. Definitely my favorite."
stephenking,2w30ru,Lucius_Funk,1 point,Mon Feb 16 21:02:37 2015 UTC,I keep the page numbers of the Apocalyptic Rock Fight written down and sometime I go back and read it over again. It's so amazingly well-written. I adore that part of the book.   I actually don't want to watch the movie or mini series (or are they one and the same?) because I couldn't bear to lose the images I have of every moment in that book. It would be like destroying a piece of my childhood and replacing it with something that could never be as pure or intense or solid as the original.
stephenking,2w30ru,mangarooboo,1 point,Mon Feb 16 21:50:57 2015 UTC,"The movie and mini-series are the same thing. They are remaking the movie, though."

I saw a part of it years and years ago, probably close to ten years ago now, right around when I read the book, and I stopped because I didn't want to ruin the images I had in my head.  How funny. I had no idea they were even the same thing. I feel like an idiot for not knowing that, but I guess that just goes to show how much I avoid the movie. I even bought a collection of Stephen King stuff for myself for Christmas and it included It. I was confused about how it was a mini series and not a movie, so I just assumed there were two different versions.  Well, now I know! Haha. Thanks. I'll have to research the new movie!"
stephenking,2w30ru,Lucius_Funk,2,Thu Feb 19 00:51:22 2015 UTC,I remember how scary the movie was when i first saw it around the age of 10. It wasn't until i read the novel a couple of years ago that the psychological impact on the characters hit home.  Its funny how i never got the reason Richie died until i read the book. Always thought Pennywise got him

stephenking,2w30ru,samedreamchina,1 point,Wed Feb 18 20:08:02 2015 UTC,The scene with the girl having tea with the old lady (been years since I read it and can't remember names) was super scary for me for some reason. And of everything going on in the miniseries this scene put it over the top for me when I was kid. I have no idea why.
stephenking,2w30ru,samedreamchina,1 point,Tue Feb 17 05:38:37 2015 UTC,I think the idea of being trapped in an adults home when you're a child is very scary. Never mind being trapped in a house with a supernatural evil being. I would certainly agree that this scene was the scariest in the book.
stephenking,2w30ru,MidwesternWolf,1 point,Tue Feb 17 12:35:57 2015 UTC,"I remember reading IT when I was 19, I read it during the summer when I had time off university.

I'd stay up til around 5-6 AM reading and stop when it became light, telling myself it was because I wanted to keep on reading, but the real reason was a bit more embarrassing..."
stephenking,2w30ru,BeardleySmith,1 point,Tue Feb 17 12:33:11 2015 UTC,"IT might have been one of the most risky books I have ever seen published by a big name author. The writing style in it is like nothing I have ever seen before. I read this book back in 6th grade, and right after started The Stand, and I also recently re-read it, almost two months ago. Like you said, it wasn't the scary that most people expect from something scary. It was more of an emotional fear, that will slowly become a large fear factor. All in all, great book. One of my most enjoyed books!"

His obsession with goose pimples, or geese walking over someone's grave.   His obsession with farts.  Some of his black characters are caricatures, and frankly kind of insulting. Same with some of his female characters.   Some of his metaphors leave me shaking my head. But I get that he's trying to be creative and avoid cliches.  His dull narration.  His overuse of the storm metaphor.  He could stand to trim the fat a little. He's the first to admit his problem with bloat.  Child gangbang? Anyone?  His overuse of parenthesis. Sometimes it's cool, but after a while it just seems like he keeps interrupting himself. It kills the flow. This bothers me less on audiobooks.  His use of semi-colons."

I gave him the benefit of the doubt most of the time, but today as I was reading Apt Pupil, I came across this again. Sure, I thought, maybe his nails are long.

I also didn't really enjoy The Tommyknockers (the narrator was wonderful, but the story didn't keep me engaged for 25+ hours).    I started but didn't finish The Cell and Doctor Sleep.    I'm listening to Duma Key right now and I'm loving it."

Yes, sure,' George said, looking into the stormdrain.  And a balloon? I’ve got red and green and yellow and blue...'  Do they float?'  Float?' The clown’s grin widened. 'Oh yes, indeed they do. They float! And there’s cotton candy...'  George reached.  The clown seized his arm.  And George saw the clown’s face change.

stephenking,2vvkk1,Damien__,5,Sat Feb 14 20:46:34 2015 UTC,I wish I had read more of his influences before I read him. They lend a new insight or add shading to his stories in subtle ways.  I've gone back and read a number of the books/authors he mentions throughout his stories & I find them to be mostly fantastic.   I'm not saying you need to have read any of them in order to get into King's works. I'm just saying that I wish I'd been more into reading worthwhile writing when I was younger instead of waiting so long.
stephenking,2vvkk1,mmmmpork,5,Sat Feb 14 19:21:16 2015 UTC,"This. I think it would be more satisfying to work from older works to newer works so you can spot the references more easily.

Now that my eyes have been opened and I have a giant library to catch up on, I really wish I wouldn't have had all that in the back of my mind lol."

stephenking,2vorjw,HoldenFinn,27,Thu Feb 12 20:29:54 2015 UTC,I think Franco does much better with the more serious roles. This casting has some real potential. I hope they don't alter the ending too much - the bittersweet tone suited the overall story well.
stephenking,2vorjw,Elphie_819,15,Thu Feb 12 21:19:44 2015 UTC,The most concerning thing about that article is the prospect of turning it into a franchise if it does well. PLEASE for Christ's sake just adapt the book as best you can and make a kick-ass miniseries.   Attempting to do multiple seasons dealing with various points in history completely undercuts the lesson Jake learns about the danger of time travel at the end of the book We could be dealing with another Under The Dome as told by CBS situation folks.
stephenking,2vorjw,no_capes,4,Fri Feb 13 00:27:50 2015 UTC,Agreed. Though I think it was more speculation by the writer of the article more than an actual possibility.

stephenking,2vorjw,BritishHobo,3,Fri Feb 13 09:03:14 2015 UTC,"Plus it fucks with a key part of the premise that I really loved, namely having to wait years to get to the event, meaning A: all his work gets erased if he goes back a second time and B: he's essentially committing a significant portion of his life to the cause. Once he finally gets it done, most of adulthood is behind him. It's a really unique and poignant take on the premise."

It's one thing when he had some subtle connections back in the 80s and 90s -- it was exciting to realize them. It wasn't made obvious -- it was just the mention of a name or a place.

stephenking,2vkuvu,Dubstep_squid,2,Wed Feb 11 21:20:29 2015 UTC,"i think what  hit me hardest about Cujo was the paragraph:  It would perhaps not be amiss to point out that he had always tried to be a good dog. He had tried to do all the things his MAN and his WOMAN, and most of all his BOY, had asked or expected of him. He would have died for them, if that had been required. He had never wanted to kill anybody. He had been struck by something, possibly destiny, or fate, or only a degenerative nerve disease called rabies. Free will was not a factor.  simply because, (slight spoiler with a little story which is linked)  throughout the whole book, you saw the two sides to Cujo. One where he was a killer dog, and where a woman is seeming him as this monster trying to kill her son at all costs, and one where he was a unbelievably friendly and loving dog struggling with something beyond his control, causing great amount of suffering for himself, which against his nature turns him into something he is not. I am a dog lover myself, and i have a friend who has a Rottweiler. not as big as a St Bernard, but a kind of dog which is persecuted around the world as being vicious and dangerous. i have seen people come to his house and are literally shit-scared of him the second they see him. but i do not know a dog who is as caring, and loving, and cuddly as Bear (that's right, Bear :P) and when i read this book i went straight to my friends house, got him on my knee (yes, it was quite uncomfortable) and hugged him for hours, simply because he reminded me of Cujo. Except for the rabies."

I remember reading in an interview that he said that when he was working on ""Misery"" he snorted coke even when typing in his typewriter. In fact, I think he said that ""Misery"" could be seen as a projection of his personal situation during those years; drugs and alcohol were his personal Anne Wilkes."

stephenking,2vir5r,KicksButtson,20,Wed Feb 11 09:21:38 2015 UTC,I always thought what was great about his writing are his characters. What makes them so interesting and relatable is most often their internal dialogue and so much of the horror is psychological. It's hard as hell to translate any of that to a visual medium without being corny or confusing. When a film writer or director leaves all that out and focuses on what we can see you lose more than half of what made the story good.
stephenking,2vir5r,NadZilla80,6,Wed Feb 11 12:49:15 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree about the internal dialogue and thoughts and feelings being easier to portray in books.  But I'm also almost always disappointed in the actors they choose to portray those characters. I get such strong images in my  head of the characters as I'm reading. I feel a connection to the characters. Then I'm almost inevitably let down in the films, not because of any lack of ability on the actors' part, but because they just don't look and sound like the characters in my head. They're not my friends, they're somebody pretending to be my friends."
stephenking,2vir5r,olily,3,Wed Feb 11 13:25:08 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with this. I find myself really caring about a lot of his characters because you get to know them so well through the internal dialogue, which means that I get scared for them. The situation isn't just generically scary, I'm worried that a character I've grown very fond of might get hurt or something."
stephenking,2vir5r,frostwinter,3,Wed Feb 11 14:33:14 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree.  King spends so much of his books on character development that it's nearly impossible for that to carry over into a 2 hour movie.  It's also why movies like Shawshank and Green Mile were successful, because those movies made it possible to invest in the characters."
stephenking,2vir5r,disirregardless,13,Wed Feb 11 18:35:53 2015 UTC,"This is something that SK touches on in Danse Macabre. Imagining something is always scarier than seeing it. So to my mind a book will always be scarier and more gripping than a film, because in the film there are limits but in your imagination there are not."
stephenking,2vir5r,frostwinter,6,Wed Feb 11 12:15:42 2015 UTC,"Exactly how I've always felt. No filmmaker has been able to capture the suspense of the novels because nothing is scarier than your own imagination, which is a point that I think SK makes very well. Too many directors fail to execute that.   Now, if Hitchcock had been alive for the reign of the King, this would be a very different discussion."
stephenking,2vir5r,ayoungjacknicholson,3,Wed Feb 11 13:07:56 2015 UTC,Oh man... Alfred Hitchcock/Stephen King.... That would be absolutely incredible.
stephenking,2vir5r,mangarooboo,7,Wed Feb 11 21:42:19 2015 UTC,I've always kind of felt that this is due to the fact that King's stories are not often action-driven. Instead they are often driven by the internal struggles and development of the characters themselves. He's very Faulkner-esque in this way.
stephenking,2vir5r,lobotomatic,5,Wed Feb 11 14:25:21 2015 UTC,"I hope this gets taken into account in case the dark tower ever gets made, especially the retrospective bits like W&G or his teaching sessions with Cort. The element that worked so well with earlier adaptations was the narrative was driven by the main character looking back to an earlier time in their life.  Stand By Me, Sometimes They Come Back, It were some of the more successful adaptations like /u/Nadzilla80 said the internal dialogue is a great venue for King's particular form of storytelling. I think this is most in part to the directors understanding how the story is portrayed. However if your stories are being turned into film one right after the other you are going to get some failures.  The success of a film and those who create it go hand in hand from what I know about the creative process. It has alot to do with attitude, ambition, and overall direction to get a great quality film. If some actors and actresses appear on board and some do not it does not matter how well it is produced or directed or funded it can turn out to be shit. It also has to do with how well the writers can translate the original work to film."
stephenking,2vir5r,KANNABULL,2,Wed Feb 11 15:38:13 2015 UTC,"It seems obvious to me in retrospect that his best adaptations are for shorts or novellas (The Body, Shawshank Redemption, Big Driver), while his sprawling epics often seem to fall short."
stephenking,2vir5r,docwilson,2,Wed Feb 11 14:24:08 2015 UTC,"It is a combination of things:  1) the enormously hard task of adapting a book to the screen.  How long did it take you to read the book?  Now fit that into 90-120 minutes.  Impossible to get the same level of buy in from the audience in such a short time because usually what is cut is character development.    2) With some exceptions (Misery and Shawshank to start), the talent level of the director and actors involved has been sub par.  They are never really set up to be really good to begin with because the budget isn't there."
stephenking,2vir5r,JLSaun,1 point,Wed Feb 11 16:09:44 2015 UTC,"And to tack onto your point about Misery and Shawshank, typically the films that come out well are non-horror or non-supernatural."
stephenking,2vir5r,Sothotheroth,2,Wed Feb 11 21:45:33 2015 UTC,"I've always loved his films. They're a little corny in places and don't retain most of the psychological feeling that his novels possess, but I still love them. I think of them as.... someone trying to tell a story second-hand. They're not going to get everything always right, but I'm going to be amused and intrigued for the most part. I treat them as related, but separate entities."
stephenking,2vir5r,iiRenity,2,Wed Feb 11 16:34:12 2015 UTC,"One of the things often forgotten in SK adaptations are the quiet relationship moments. For me, some of the most noteable things in King books are the romantic relationships he develops, (take the one at the heart of 11/22/63 for example) and these are quick to fall by the wayside when streamlining and getting to the horror of his work for adaptation."
stephenking,2vir5r,swingsetlife,1 point,Wed Feb 11 17:31:30 2015 UTC,"I think that because his writing is so particular that it's hard to translate to film. Take ""The Shining"" as an example. That film is great. It is also loosely based on the book. I think it works better that way. Take ""Salems Lot"" the 70s version as an example of the film adaptation not being so good.  Also when I look back at ""IT"" I always think the first half is great but the second half when they're grown up is so cheesy and hard to watch."
stephenking,2vir5r,Sambospudz,1 point,Wed Feb 11 11:07:58 2015 UTC,"I've always had some serious complaints about Kubrick's The Shining, both technical and otherwise. Mainly because it breaks my rule regarding adaptations and not changing the meaning or purpose of the story."
stephenking,2vir5r,shlam16,3,Wed Feb 11 11:15:53 2015 UTC,"I feel very much the same about Kubrick's The Shining. I've brought it up several times on Reddit, but it generally ends up with mass downvotes because people get very touchy about it.  He turned what is one of the greatest haunting stories of all time into a glorified cabin fever movie. It was good for what it was, but it in no way compares in quality to the book."
stephenking,2vir5r,Ken_Breadbox,3,Wed Feb 11 13:57:45 2015 UTC,"Yes! In the wider movie threads I get downvoted into the sewers when I say that Jack Nicholson was horribly miscast. Doesn't change my opinion: he was. Yes, he does great lunatic, I'm not arguing that. There may not be a better living lunatic actor. But the story called for a loving (though deeply flawed) husband and father driven slowly insane by the twin threats of his addiction and the Overlook. And Jack Nicholson was batshit crazy from the very first shot."
stephenking,2vir5r,clwestbr,1 point,Wed Feb 11 15:06:40 2015 UTC,"Well the problem is that Kurbick wanted the character of Jack to be an insane person from the start, whereas the original character was a sane person. I honestly don't have a problem with that change, except it alters the story and takes it away from King's original message and purpose. That decision could have been good if Kubrick had staged the rest of the story properly, except he fucked it up in the end."
stephenking,2vir5r,Sambospudz,3,Thu Feb 12 01:52:16 2015 UTC,"It wasn't really a cabin fever film, it was more of a breaking point. In the novel there is a growing loss of control, the film merely presents him as already on edge and ready to fall.  I love both for different reasons (Kubrick shot that shit beautifully), but the novel is stronger for sure.  The really painful part is that King tried writing his own version and the delivery and performances killed what could have been a superior adaptation.  There have been rumors, whispers in the dark corners of the internet, that DiCaprio is looking to play Jack and finance a new adaptation. Nothing reliable, but the idea intrigues me..."
stephenking,2vir5r,Dubstep_squid,1 point,Wed Feb 11 18:24:28 2015 UTC,"When it comes to The Shining (or any Kubrick film) the audience is always split... 1/3 of the audience thinks it's a fucking masterpiece just because Kubrick made it and they attend the church of Kubrick every Sunday where they drink the Kool-Aid... 1/3 of the audience doesn't get it but sees how stunning the visuals are so they assume Kubrick is a genius so the reason they don't get it must because whatever ""it"" is goes way over their heads so they say it's an awesome movie just to pretend it didn't go over their heads... And 1/3 of the audience didn't get it and realizes this is because Kubrick's message in the film is inconsistent and they know that stunning visuals may be nice but they don't make up for bad storytelling."
stephenking,2vir5r,cavaliereternally,2,Wed Feb 11 19:33:14 2015 UTC,I watched the film years ago when I was a kid and read the book when I was an adult. I view them as two separate things. I feel the film is only based on the book. And I suppose if you see it that way then Kubrick had a lot of wiggle room.  If you were to adapt the book into a film properly I'd say it would be at least 4 hours long. I love both the book and the film.

So much of the plot of any given SK novel is built by the omniscient narrator, and lacking this, they are forced to translate it to awkward, unnatural conversation."

stephenking,2vir5r,themightyikari,1 point,Thu Feb 12 21:16:15 2015 UTC,Horror is the red-headed stepchild of the movie industry. They get less budget lessor actors/directors when to make them good they need more. They need scifi blockbuster budgets
stephenking,2vir5r,shlam16,1 point,Sun Feb 15 21:37:55 2015 UTC,"Bad directors. Bad screen writing. Bad casting. Too much studio head meddling. And letting Stephen get too involved.

stephenking,2vir5r,themightyikari,2,Wed Feb 11 13:01:09 2015 UTC,"There's a good reason for him meddling though. He takes great pride in his stories, and it hurts him to see them done poorly. He loathed Kubrick's The Shining because it entirely butchered the point of the story.   Sure, it was probably the most critically acclaimed adaptation of them all; but that doesn't take away from the reason he wants to retain creative control."
stephenking,2vir5r,GaijinSama,1 point,Wed Feb 11 14:03:32 2015 UTC,"I understand his feelings. But he doesn't help. His involvement has never produced a better adaptation. He needs to write his books, and if he sells the rights to let the movie makers do their job. His The Shining is maybe a more accurate adaptation of the book. But it's not a very good movie(mini series really). OTOH if talented people are involved we get things like Shawshank, the Green Mile, and Stand By Me. The straight horror movies are more problematic. But Horror always is. In short SK need to stick to his strengths which are the books, and let it go once he sells the rights."

EDIT: As for DT, I would recommend starting at Wolves of the Calla if it's been a while since you left off. The last three books mark the ""beginning of the end"" and should be read at least close to each other."

IT was another one I was considering, but it seemed formidable and I'm afraid to hell of clowns  I'm planning on starting DT from the beginning when I dive back in. any other way doesn't seem right. in fact I might pick up The Gunslinger and read one installment between each of the other books I pick up. I remember it being a fairly quick read through and it might be a good refresher after Lisey's Story  if I went with the IT and 11/22/63 combo, which would you recommend to be read first?"
stephenking,2vbtbb,AManHasSpoken,5,Mon Feb 9 19:30:25 2015 UTC,Definitely go with IT first. There's a few sections in 11/22/63 that become much more enjoyable if you've read IT.

I thought he was beautifully portrayed by Tim Curry and the library scene in both the book and the movie is one of my favorites.  Hero: OMG, there are just too many to name one. The great thing I find in Stephen King books is that every one of the protagonists have characteristics that I either see in myself or want to see in myself.  Jack Sawyer from The Talisman and Black House. I actually saw more of myself in adult Jack Sawyer from Black House. I like his modest demeanor, how he's not willing to tell everybody he meets who his mother was. I also came to appreciate his relationship with Henry Leyden as years after I read the book for the first time, I developed the same friendship with an older coworker I took home after work every night.  Roland Deschain: One of the things that hooked me into The Gunslinger and The Dark Tower series was Roland's features. Lots of people picture themselves as the hero of the story but it makes it easier when said hero has the same color of hair and eyes that you do. I can't act worth a damn so I won't be in any movies but I'll always picture Roland as an older version of myself.  Daniel Torrance from Doctor Sleep: I loved The Shining but never really saw myself in Danny because he was a 5 year old kid and when I first read the book, I was a 16 year old teenager who didn't remember when I was 5. Although our dads had sort of the same personality, my dad would go insane at The Overlook. Anyway I see a lot of similarities with both adult Dan and Jack Sawyer. I like his drifter personality, that he works in the healthcare field as I do, his relationships to the other characters in the book and that his taking over as the teacher as Dick was once considered to him.   Dolores Claiborne, because she is one tough, great, and underrated mother. Kathy Bates also played the hell out of her! It's one of my favorites of her roles up there with Misery.  Lots of people from The Stand; Stu Redman for his leadership skills and overall personality. Glen Bateman for his overall outlook on life and the situation they were in. Nick Andros for the way he overcomes the challenge of being deaf and I loved his friendship with Tom Cullen. Larry Underwood, his modest demeanor, the way he took in the responsibility of not only a kid but an entire group of people during the migration to Boulder, and generally his entire turnaround from a partyboy celebrity who might have been an alleged addict to the upstanding person his mom tried to make him out to be."

I also didn't like the deviation from the story in the movie at the end. The detective felt so much more menacing in the story, in the movie he just seemed weak, as if he was no real threat at all to Darcy. I wish I knew why it was so hard to translate King's work to the big screen. It just seems that there are so many more examples of failures than successes in this regard.

I was about 11 when I read the book, and it was amazing and I really became immersed in the book. I can't watch the movie now, because I've read the book so many times that they are real people and events to me, and I don't like someone telling the story differently."

stephenking,2v2nho,Prin_StropInAh,2,Sat Feb 7 19:16:05 2015 UTC,One of his best books.
stephenking,2v1yhy,Dubstep_squid,15,Sat Feb 7 02:41:16 2015 UTC,"It does have a nice connection with 11/22/63. That might be a good next novel.  However, you might need a break from his large works. I always suggest The Shining or 'Salem's Lot.   Like others here, I suggest The Dark Tower series, but I'd suggest completing The Stand, Insomnia, and Eyes of the Dragon before beginning the series.   Welcome and congratulations on becoming a Constant Reader!"
stephenking,2v1yhy,fourdaystubble,10,Sat Feb 7 04:16:07 2015 UTC,"Christine was always one of my favorites, Dark Tower series is AWESOME, I have always enjoyed his short stories as well."
stephenking,2v1yhy,kilted_cad_wizard,4,Sat Feb 7 02:56:54 2015 UTC,Christine is indeed very special. I highly recommend it.
stephenking,2v1yhy,frostblooded,6,Sat Feb 7 03:24:33 2015 UTC,"Go back and read The Shining. It was his next book after Carrie, and I'd argue it is his tightest all around book. Don't start reading the Dark Tower until you've read It and The Stand as  it really makes a lot of references back to those two books."
stephenking,2v1yhy,EnIdiot,6,Sat Feb 7 05:20:46 2015 UTC,Seriously. The Shining was the most wonderfully terrifying piece of fiction that I've ever read. It was a fantastic book.
stephenking,2v1yhy,JitteryPenguin,2,Sat Feb 7 06:10:45 2015 UTC,"It had some of the best psychological development of characters that I've ever read. It seems to me as if the whole back story (which is just hinted at)  gives the hotel at personality all its own. Yeah, I'd read it and then wait a while and read Dr Sleep."
stephenking,2v1yhy,EnIdiot,2,Sat Feb 7 15:36:38 2015 UTC,"I read the shining last spring. I think Dr Sleep is going to be my ""first day of spring"" read. I always try to start something cool on the first day of spring and the first day of summer."

stephenking,2v1yhy,JitteryPenguin,1 point,Sat Feb 7 23:19:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think that was King's biggest problem with Kubrick's version. Jack Torrance was at heart a good man who wanted to matter. The Overlook used this desire and his alcoholism to really ruin his goodness."
stephenking,2v1yhy,EnIdiot,1 point,Sun Feb 8 01:01:50 2015 UTC,"I hate the Kubrick version of that story. It gets all the scary stuff on the surface, but without the rest of the story it just doesn't have as much impact."
stephenking,2v1yhy,JitteryPenguin,5,Sun Feb 8 01:32:12 2015 UTC,"The (complete and un-cut edition) Stand lags in places, but it really is worth the read. I can't suggest strongly enough that you try to get back into it.   Also, congratulations :)  Carrie was the first of his books I ever read too, and I was hopelessly and irrevocably hooked.  I now have a collection of over 30 of his books and short stories, and each birthday and christmas i'm always asking for more.   King likes to use the term 'constant reader' quite a bit.. and I always find it heart warming to come by this subreddit and see just how many of us there are.   Again, congratulations! I hope you enjoy his work as much as I did/do. :)"
stephenking,2v1yhy,Desparia,4,Sat Feb 7 05:15:23 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed Misery. It is on the shorter end, and I found that I could really feel the main guy's struggles."
stephenking,2v1yhy,chubbzatha,2,Sat Feb 7 05:52:41 2015 UTC,I'll add 'The Girl who loved Tom Gordon' and 'Gearld's Game' to that list of short but fecking awesome King books.
stephenking,2v1yhy,sartres-shart,3,Sat Feb 7 09:17:29 2015 UTC,"He is simply the best...such a brilliant writer. I'm making my way through all of them, can't put them down, but don't want to read them too fast either. I don't want them to end!!"
stephenking,2v1yhy,blissblueberry,3,Sat Feb 7 03:15:27 2015 UTC,Cujo. Read Cujo.
stephenking,2v1yhy,white_pony_girl,3,Sat Feb 7 06:01:38 2015 UTC,You should definitely read 'Salem's Lot. It's definitely top 5 SK books in my opinion.
stephenking,2v1yhy,PlayerTP,3,Sat Feb 7 06:01:41 2015 UTC,"I'm reading different seasons now. I just finished eyes of the dragon and started with the dark tower books.  His newest book, Revival was pretty crazy. Check that one out. Also, if anyone is interested check out NOS4A2 by his son joe hill. It has easter eggs...."
stephenking,2v1yhy,Slowspines,3,Sat Feb 7 06:18:30 2015 UTC,"As a treat, find his audio books that he narrated himself. He's a terrific reader of his own fiction.   Desperation Bag of Bones   Are wonderful.  Craig Wasson narrated 11-22-63 -- he actually read it in a way that reminded me very much of King's narration."
stephenking,2v1yhy,Jerry368,1 point,Sat Feb 7 09:21:03 2015 UTC,"Desperation, never seems to get a lot of praise but I love it, a rare instance where it's action right from the get go not 20 chapters of mood setting."
stephenking,2v1yhy,Reggler,2,Sat Feb 7 18:19:32 2015 UTC,Right from the get go is right! Pretty shocking entry into the rest of the book.
stephenking,2v1yhy,Jerry368,2,Sun Feb 8 00:35:41 2015 UTC,"My favorite book of his is Different Seasons, which is actually a collection of 4 novellas. I recommend it to anyone.  A lot of people are going to suggest that you read the Dark Tower series, but that is quite an investment. I loved the series, but it may not be what you're looking for unless you're willing to take up a few months to read it."
stephenking,2v1yhy,batbirthcontrol,1 point,Sat Feb 7 05:22:57 2015 UTC,I like to advise people who are really enjoying King to save the DT for as long as possible. The more connections you're able to make on your own the richer the experience I think.
stephenking,2v1yhy,elainaphillippe,2,Sat Feb 7 13:21:52 2015 UTC,As a side note I recommend you keeping both Skeleton Crew & Night Shift handy. You can always find a little free time to read a short of his to just curb the S.K. itch.  *Edit: add Nightmares & Dreamscapes to that
stephenking,2v1yhy,ieatplaydough,3,Sat Feb 7 08:51:01 2015 UTC,"It is good but you should also check out The Dark Tower series, it starts with The Gunslinger. Eyes of the Dragon, Cujo, and Salem's Lot are also good. Really pretty much all of King's stuff is worth reading..."
stephenking,2v1yhy,Accidentalboredom,1 point,Sat Feb 7 02:56:16 2015 UTC,"Actually, I recommend four past midnight. There are four small stories. I loved it.. IT is awesome. I recently read it. It is kinda long though.. I got this feeling that SK's book is really not about monsters but people.. Weak, selfish, monstrous people... But there is justice (in most of the stories at least).. People grow independent and conquer whatever weakening them... I love the writing style!!!"
stephenking,2v1yhy,Lubbadubdub,1 point,Sat Feb 7 06:55:35 2015 UTC,"There are four small stories.   Always heard them as short stories.  But in the case of King, nothing is ever short."

If you read the dark tower be aware that song of susannah and the final book totally ruined the series for me, it was horrible, never been so disappointed in my life."
stephenking,2v1yhy,jl45,1 point,Sat Feb 7 11:51:06 2015 UTC,"Strange how varied peoples tastes are. I thought his work in the 90's was hit and miss at best. Didn't like Rose Madder, Desperation was meh, Regulators sucked, Insomnia and Needful things were good though.  And regarding the Dark Tower - I loved books 6 and 7 as much, if not more than the rest of the series."
stephenking,2v1yhy,shlam16,1 point,Sat Feb 7 12:50:54 2015 UTC,"My suggestion is to read them in chronological order. I love his new stuff, don't get me wrong - but I think he did his best work in the 70's and 80's."

I had such a terrible assumption that SK would be dry and dull and I avoided his novels for a long time. After reading Tommyknockers, I was totally hooked. It is fantastic.   Others I have enjoyed: The Gunslinger, Carrie, The Shining and I'm currently reading The Dark Half. I can't wait to read more of them!"
stephenking,2v1yhy,dangerkittin,1 point,Mon Feb 9 19:01:57 2015 UTC,"The thing that really did it for me was the Tower series. I hadn't read much King before then, but after the DT I read a bunch more of his stuff just to try and understand all the connections. It's pretty amazing how many (most?) of his books are connected to each other in some way.  If you start DT, prepare to not have a life for a few months."
stephenking,2v1yhy,mattwilliams06,1 point,Mon Feb 9 20:11:54 2015 UTC,"I started with IT, and was hooked after that. I'm also fairly new to this subreddit, and reddit in general. Been a lurker for a while. What hooked me was how King made everything flow but also include an immense amount of detail. After IT, I read a more recent one, Mr. Mercedes. A nice crime/thriller that still feels like King. I followed that with Joyland, which was a nice shorter story and crime as well. I went back to a classic and read The Shining. Intense narrative and perspective from a young boy and his parents is so engaging and just... Wow. Great book. I'm currently about halfway through 11/22/63 and it's one of the best books I've ever read.   2 things.  1: I might be biased for 11/22/63 because I'm a history major, but even if you aren't, it's amazing.  2:I listen to all his books and I find I'm able to keep my mind more engaged and imagine more when someone else is reading it.   Sorry for any grammar errors and no italics. I'm very new to reddit and I'm currently on a mobile device. Let me know if I can improve my posting."
stephenking,2v1upa,MrDrummond,3,Sat Feb 7 02:04:00 2015 UTC,"This is one of his top works for me. Not as good as The Stand or the Shining, but better than Under The Dome. I'd say on par with the Running Man"
stephenking,2v1upa,NotSomeAgent,2,Mon Feb 9 18:59:03 2015 UTC,Im about 1/3rd of the way through it and it is honestly one of my favorite books.  It gets amazing and even the parts where not much happens have you transfixed and interested.  I can't wait to finish it.
stephenking,2v1upa,Dubstep_squid,2,Sat Feb 7 02:33:53 2015 UTC,"To me 11/22/63 was on par with The Stand and I do not say that lightly. The Stand was my first King book and so I treat it with more reverence. I bought the book after seeing it on sale in Hastings for $5, marked down from its usual $30. I went it knowing nothing of JFK besides he was assassinated. I fell in love almost immediately. A book of that size can usually take me up to a week, if not a couple, but I finished it within days and was left still feeling as if I could devour a thousand pages more."

stephenking,2uw86d,acassese,9,Thu Feb 5 18:18:34 2015 UTC,"I'm the same way.  I found the cutesy private spouse stuff- sayings and private jokes, etc.- difficult to get into, and almost gave up on it.  But when the story takes off I think the setup he's done adds impact and emotional resonance at the end."
stephenking,2uw86d,notsosilentbob,3,Thu Feb 5 18:57:23 2015 UTC,I'm getting that sense now. All of the in jokes gave me this feeling like i wasn't understanding what was happening. But its slowly coming together almost halfway through
stephenking,2uw86d,mangarooboo,4,Thu Feb 5 18:59:49 2015 UTC,Yeah. It's like it's written in backwards order compared to the rest of his books. But it has such a beautiful conclusion... It's actually stuck with me more than some of his other works have.
stephenking,2uw86d,mangarooboo,3,Thu Feb 5 19:46:16 2015 UTC,Hahaha I totally thought that said pirate spouse.

stephenking,2uw86d,EHendrix,5,Thu Feb 5 18:41:29 2015 UTC,"It seems like everyone has one or two King books they can't quite get into. For me it is ""From a Buick 8""and ""The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon""."
stephenking,2uw86d,mangarooboo,5,Thu Feb 5 19:04:10 2015 UTC,I couldn't finish Cell. I've read about 80% of it and you'd think I'd finish it after devoting so much time to it but... I just can't bring myself to finish it.
stephenking,2uw86d,mikemonk2004,4,Thu Feb 5 19:43:50 2015 UTC,"I did finish Cell, and I am sorry I did.  That is one of my least favorite SK books.  Although From a Buick 8 takes the cake for me.  That is one book, I threw down at the halfway point, and not for time reasons with the intent to pick it back up again.  I know I will never pick up that story again."
stephenking,2uw86d,mikemonk2004,2,Thu Feb 5 22:13:13 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, I loved From a Buick 8.   The one I couldn't stand was Insomnia -- because of how much I enjoyed the first half. It starts out as this suspenseful, paranoid horror story that reads like a descent into madness. And then it basically turns into a superhero story."
stephenking,2uw86d,foulmouthangel,1 point,Fri Feb 6 03:38:47 2015 UTC,"Personally, with From a Buick 8, the Dark Tower  kind of ruined it for me.  I think it could have been different if I had read it before the DT books.  I had a similar reaction to Hearts in Atlantis.  DT7 basically gives away the entire story, so it was really hard to enjoy it.  With Buick, it just felt like there was no mystery to it, since the overall story was so related to DT.  Although very different in plot, Buick reminded me of the Colorado Kid, which I did really enjoy.  So I think the DT series ruined Buick for me personally.  I agree with you on Insomnia to an extent.  That was one I didn't finish, although I frequently do not finish books (or TV shows, or movies, etc.) as I hate endings generally, and am very happy to leave a story ""at the right time.""  Seriously, how many SK books would be better if we left them at the right point when he's established the world of the book before a disappointing ending?  I didn't do it consciously with Insomnia, and I fully intended to pick it back up and finish it.  However, I am pretty glad I didn't.  I got the ending of it from DT7 of course, but I did really enjoy the beginning of that story quite a bit.  I left off at about the 2/3rds point, and don't really regret it at all.  It was a very enjoyable story to that point, but I don't feel I missed anything by putting it down then.  Unrelated to this discussion, but Insomnia has one of my favorite opening lines of all time.  ""Nobody told {Character} that his wife was going to die.  However, there came a point where he didn't need to be told.""  I don't remember the character's names, but that really stuck with me.  That really got me hooked on the story.  I would not put Insomnia in the same league as the DT, but I remember thinking how strong both openings were, and as an introduction to a story in the very first paragraph, you can't beat it. Nobody does the short ""stakes setting"" description better than SK imo.  I can certainly understand your larger point about stories that start off as one thing, and turn into something generic.  I had a similar reaction to Mr. Mercedes.""  That started out with a very compelling villain, and opening.  Then it turned into a generic episode of the TV show Criminal Minds.  While that show is watchable for me, I would never confuse it with high art.  My thought upon finishing it was that if they swapped out the ""recently retired detective"" with the ""soon to be retired detective"" that was conflicted about the job, things he had seen, etc., that it would make for a pretty generic TV episode.  If you like the ""descent into madness"" part of Insomnia, have you read Revival yet?  That books left me fairly underwhelmed for much of it.  Every time you think ""well, I see where he is going with this, let's see what he does with it"", he veers off wildly in another direction.  It is probably my favorite SK ending after The Mist.  If you haven't had a chance to read it yet, I would strongly recommend it."
stephenking,2uw86d,LeftMySoulAtHome,1 point,Fri Feb 6 08:29:14 2015 UTC,"Personally, with From a Buick 8, the Dark Tower kind of ruined it for me.   I think that's what ruined Insomnia as well. It feels like he got halfway into writing the book and then decided to add the unnecessary Dark Tower tie-ins. I actually was already reading the Dark Tower series when I read Insomnia, but it was still an abrupt change of tone that really put me off.   I agree with you on Insomnia to an extent. That was one I didn't finish, although I frequently do not finish books (or TV shows, or movies, etc.) as I hate endings generally, and am very happy to leave a story ""at the right time.""    I do the same, but not necessarily because I hate endings. If I don't breeze through a book pretty quickly, I'll end up getting bored and distracted by something else.   Unrelated to this discussion, but Insomnia has one of my favorite opening lines of all time. ""Nobody told {Character} that his wife was going to die. However, there came a point where he didn't need to be told."" I don't remember the character's names, but that really stuck with me. That really got me hooked on the story.   Right? For the first half of the story, I was actually convinced that this was going to be my new favorite Stephen King book. That's a big part of why the ending was so disappointing for me.    If you like the ""descent into madness"" part of Insomnia, have you read Revival yet?   No, I haven't read Mr. Mercedes or Revival yet. They're both on my list."
stephenking,2uw86d,adab1,3,Fri Feb 6 14:25:09 2015 UTC,I'm the complete opposite. I loved it so much. I couldn't put it down. It was so intensely personal and sad and layered.
stephenking,2uw86d,theycallmebrodie,2,Thu Feb 5 22:14:58 2015 UTC,"There are very few King books that I dislike, and Lisey's Story is one of them. (Actually, I'd say it's the one I dislike most.) There are some good parts, but I just couldn't get into it. I made myself finish it, because I'd read all of his books at that point and I have never been able to abandon a book. It really dragged on for me.  Plus, I have to say, I'd never heard the nickname ""Lisey"" before, and I wasn't sure how to say it at first. It felt clunky and my brain stuttered every time I saw it. That's a personal issue, I know. But it's one of the many reasons the book was a challenge for me."

Not much of the fiction I read has a female protagonist and I wasn't sure I'd like it, but as soon as I relaxed into the book and let it be, I was really touched by it."
stephenking,2uw86d,mikemonk2004,2,Fri Feb 6 03:12:18 2015 UTC,"You can get through it, Babyluv.  I had the same experience.  It didn't hook me until the basement scene.  Then it got interesting real fast."
stephenking,2uw86d,sammidavisjr,1 point,Mon Feb 9 21:22:19 2015 UTC,"I definitely struggled with this one too. It just didn't grab me, and the term ""Boo-ya Moon"" really really bothered me for some reason. It just grated on my brain, like the word ""moist"", it was just... yuck.  The only other book of his I disliked was Rose Madder, I just couldn't get into it, and found myself not really growing to care whay happened to the character. Thinking about it now, a lot of his books have the recurring theme of the main characters having to travel to other worlds to solve some sort of problem or another, I never realized home many before."
stephenking,2uw86d,nimbleVaguerant,1 point,Thu Feb 5 21:38:32 2015 UTC,"Personally, I read half of it and then put it down for over a year.  I eventually picked it back up, and was glad I did.  It has some of my favorite King imagery in it, and some of the characters get pretty memorable.    However, it is unique as a King book.  I enjoyed the imagery quite a bit, but the story is a bit slower than many of his books.  However, I would recommend you keep going.  Once of my favorite King books is The Talisman, and I absolutely was ready to put it down completely at page 100.  I kept reading it because people told me it would get better, and I am really glad I did.  Lisey's Story isn't at the same level, but it still worth finishing."

The beginning just reminded me of Nathaniel Hawthorne's writing in The Scarlet Letter, which I did not like.  But once I got past the first section it was smooth sailing."

When I started that, I had the exact same impression.  It is unique among King's works (and probably due to the split authorship).    I didn't hate the first part of the book (the way I did with The Talisman), but I was blown away by how unusual the style was.    I did really enjoy Black House in the end, but it was very unusual."

stephenking,2unu6h,city17_dweller,19,Tue Feb 3 18:45:12 2015 UTC,"The original plans for this subdivision had this street connecting to one in the next neighborhood over. The HOA decided last minute that they didn't want the streets connected but it had already been named the same as the street it was supposed to connect to. It stayed that way for almost 10 years.  A few years ago they discovered that this created a conflict in the e911 system having two streets with the same name so, as there were less houses in our neighborhood on this street they told us it had to be renamed and asked the residents for suggestions for a new name.   This was one of the names I suggested. I never expected them to actually choose it. All I can guess was that one or more of the city council members or whoever was in charge of this must have been a King fan.   I think it's awesome but a few of my neighbors were not pleased about it and actually petitioned the city to have it renamed again not even a year later and almost succeeded until I got wind of what they were doing and raised enough stink to stop them.   They feel like it must have some evil connotation and just sounds vile and scary and I felt a little silly trying to explain what the dark tower was in the context of the books, but in the end it was worth it.

stephenking,2uh9j8,shlam16,5,Mon Feb 2 04:53:47 2015 UTC,"This isn't true at all.   most of his books really aren't horror   Most of his new books maybe. The books which made him famous, and which are synonymous as his classics - they are the definition of horror.  Genuinely not trying to sound snobbish, but I have to wonder how many people around here have read his older books. He seems to be far more praised amongst this subreddit for his newer works which makes me think that many either aren't into horror, or haven't made it to his classics yet.  These new books like UTD and 11/22/63 are fun reads, but IMHO they pale in comparison to the stuff he was writing decades ago."
stephenking,2uh9j8,EHendrix,2,Mon Feb 2 08:10:47 2015 UTC,"I don't consider a great deal of his older books horror. I would say a bit less than half were horror, most are definitely supernatural, but not all horror."

The vast majority are pure horror, and the rest are all horror/thriller hybrids or fantasy/horror hybrids. Still horror nonetheless."
stephenking,2uh9j8,EHendrix,2,Mon Feb 2 20:32:42 2015 UTC,"That's a matter of opinion. I don't consider Rage, The Stand, The Long Walk, Firestarter, The Running Man, The Dark Tower, Thinner, and Road Work, which you left out, to be horror. Especially The Stand and the Dark Tower. Its all a matter of opinion."
stephenking,2uh9j8,EHendrix,2,Tue Feb 3 08:39:03 2015 UTC,"Oops, forgot Roadwork, but I haven't read it so I'm in no position to comment on it.   That's a matter of opinion. I don't consider...   That's a matter of your opinion. Considering the rest of the world classify them as such, I don't think I'm off-base in saying so either.  Many people have a misconception of horror. They seem to think that it requires something to be ""scary"" or to ""startle"" or ""induce fear"". While all apt descriptors, none of these are entirely correct.   Horror is a film genre seeking to elicit a negative emotional reaction from viewers by playing on the audience's primal fears.   The macabre and the supernatural are frequent themes. Thus they may overlap with the fantasy, supernatural, and thriller genres.   This means that if it has the ability to make you uncomfortable, to make you sit and think about how fucked up something is, then it inherently fits under the horror bracket.  For this reason, a large portion of the ""thriller"" genre is basically a sub-genre of horror.  Yes, I know this is off a film wiki, but the description of the genre doesn't change between mediums."
stephenking,2uh9j8,damfries,3,Tue Feb 3 13:35:48 2015 UTC,"With that definition Curb Your Enthusiasm is the most successful piece of ""horror"" ever produced."
stephenking,2uh9j8,shlam16,1 point,Tue Feb 3 14:03:07 2015 UTC,"There's a big difference between awkward and primal fear, so no, it really isn't.  Addressing your other comment here: okay, so you don't think school shootings, lawlessness and an evil wizard, impending death, kidnapping, being hunted, or being cursed ""induce feelings of horror""?  We really are at an impasse here. You are firm in your beliefs, so I see no further need to try and change your mind.   My parting comment is to reiterate a sentiment I said earlier: There's a reason the general consensus worldwide is that his novels are works of horror."
stephenking,2uh9j8,synisterslipandslide,2,Tue Feb 3 14:18:00 2015 UTC,"Primal Fears encompass many things, fear of the unknown, fear of the dark, fear of public speaking, fear of being humiliated. I used Curb as an example of how genre can not be shoehorned by a definition.  All of King's novels are classified as Horror, even the one that you don't consider to be horror, like 11/22/63, because it is Stephen King.   Just because something can induce horror does not make it horror, when I was much younger I was deeply and wholly terrified by the library ghost in the beginning of Ghostbusters. There is nothing that has ever terrified me as much as that ghost's transformation. Ghostbusters is most definitely not horror.  I don't consider The Stand and The Dark Tower as horror for the same reasons I don't consider The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings horror.   Just because there are elements in something that can also be in horror doesn't mean they are horror. Thinner has some dark themes in it to be sure, but it also has a mobster menacing gypsies.   I am saying that genre isn't black and white. You are saying that everything horror because the guys in marketing sell tag it ""from the master of horror"".   To just lump King's early works as horror is a disservice to the man as a writer. His works are much deeper and more nuanced to just say hey this is horror.  As far as an impasse goes the only one I see is you being unwilling to admit anything other than being right."
stephenking,2uh9j8,scaryketchup,0,Tue Feb 3 14:45:40 2015 UTC,"To quote Wikipedia back to you   ""Horror fiction, horror literature and also horror fantasy are genres of literature, which are intended to, or have the capacity to frighten, scare, or startle their readers by inducing feelings of horror and terror.""  That's probably why people think that horror literature is meant to be scary or to startle. Because its in the definition."
stephenking,2uh9j8,crashdown711,1 point,Tue Feb 3 15:12:10 2015 UTC,"what I particularly loved about Carrie and why I disagree with you in that it was a pure horror novel is the sheer amount of characterisation he laid down for her before she flipped. She's just like a normal teenage girl who had a chance at a normal life, gifted to her by virtue of the kindness of someone who realised that life is about much more than your prom dress, but got twisted by circumstances and the unfortunate ""gift"" she apparently had. That was the true tragedy of the story."
stephenking,2uh9j8,spacebrew,1 point,Tue Feb 3 14:24:28 2015 UTC,"Sure, not arguing any of your points here - however I don't think that changes the genre. It may be tragic, but that doesn't discount the fact that it is a horror novel."

Even though The Shining (Kubrick) butchered the book, it is still regarded as an all time classic...

stephenking,2uby0n,sparrow4,5,Sun Feb 1 20:32:18 2015 UTC,"I was struck by one particular phrase in Harold's death scene, after the motorcycle crash: ""a victim of his own protracted adolescence."" That was such a great summary of Harold's character in so few words.  Harold caused me more mixed feelings than any other character in the book. I would find myself empathizing with him, thinking, ""Come on, Harold, get it together, you can do it,"" and then I would read one of his LEDGER entries or an internal monologue about Frannie and feel guilty about rooting for such a creep. Still, every time I reread the beginning of the part where Nadine and Harold get together, right after Larry turns her down, I always end up mentally shouting at Nadine to fuck off and go West already, or hoping for a meteor to land on her, because I know that Harold is so close to growing up and she's going to drag him down with her.  So, yeah, I do feel sorry for Harold. Every time I read the book, I can't help wondering whether something as small as Weizak not interrupting him as he's realizing that 'Hawk' isn't a sarcastic nickname could have sent him down a different path. Still, Harold's ultimately responsible for his own actions, and the fact that he was ""misled"" doesn't mean he didn't bring his destruction on himself."

stephenking,2ud10w,GaijinSama,2,Sun Feb 1 05:03:04 2015 UTC,"Well, I wasn't in love with most of that collection, but I respected it.

stephenking,2ubktc,GaijinSama,7,Sat Jan 31 17:41:28 2015 UTC,"I think working with Stephen King on The Talisman was both the best and the worst thing Peter Straub ever did for his career. When I first read The Talisman, it was in the heights of my middle-school obsession with King, when I was reading through every book at the pace of one or two a week. The Talisman was the first one that seemed like a struggle to get through, and I found it horribly dull for the first 100 pages or so(after which it got pretty awesome). Now, since I'd loved every Stephen King book I'd read up until that point, I assumed the reason for my disappointment must be this Peter Straub guy.  And so it wasn't until I was in my mid-twenties that I actually decided to read something by Peter Straub himself. Starting with Ghost Story(which is a classic in a way, but does not hold up very well), and then moving through his Blue Rose trilogy. I've since become a Straub devotee, and while I haven't read everything he's done, I'm getting close.   I'm interested in the sub's thoughts, because after reading a dozen or so Straub books, it's blindingly obvious why he and Stephen King are friends and collaborators. I think Straub is a more virtuosic writer(not better, just fancier), and they're tastes are a bit different, but otherwise they are very similar. Stephen King strikes me as a blue collar man of the people, an AC/DC song. Peter Straub strikes me as a more upper-middle-class man with refined tastes, more of a Miles Davis groove. But otherwise, they seem to almost be the same person, their interests and worldviews are very similar.  And finally, I bring this up because I just finished reading his latest novel, A Dark Matter, which absolutely astounded me. It's almost the ultimate Straub book, dealing as it does with the ways the past informs our present, and it almost seems like an alternate version of Revival, since it deals with a world-changing event only tangentially experienced by the main character. I highly, highly recommend it to the readers here."
stephenking,2ubktc,DOLO_F_PHD,3,Sat Jan 31 17:41:33 2015 UTC,Nice. now I'm stocked to get more into a dark matter.
stephenking,2ubktc,bigblackhotdog,2,Sat Jan 31 18:27:38 2015 UTC,"The Talisman was a good book, and like you said it was horribly boring at first. I just assumed it was Straub that wrote the part and King fixed the rest since I've never read anything by him lol. Especially since the book has so many dark tower connections it just felt like a real king novel. Maybe i was wrong and straub is also a good novelist in his own."
stephenking,2ubktc,bigblackhotdog,2,Sun Feb 1 07:17:18 2015 UTC,"You're wrong, but so was I. Apparently they wrote it chapter by chapter. Basically writing for a few pages, sending it off to the other, who would then add on to those pages. I don't think everything wrong with those first hundred pages can be blamed on Straub."
stephenking,2ubktc,LozziWithALongO,1 point,Sun Feb 1 07:49:36 2015 UTC,Yeah it was really bad. Honestly the whole storyline was pretty bad until he got through the cave. Then somehow it just...clicked.
stephenking,2ubktc,LozziWithALongO,1 point,Sun Feb 1 08:11:28 2015 UTC,I read the talisman a few months ago and it was an overall great story with a handful of spots that I really had to push through. I'm currently reading black house and its pretty much the same way. I have a bunch of Straub books that I haven't read yet.
stephenking,2ubktc,RisingRapture,3,Sat Jan 31 18:22:00 2015 UTC,"Which ones do you have? I will say Ghost Story isn't a horrible book, but it seems naive in comparison to his later works. It has some weird victorian, very prudish attitudes to sex and women, which isn't something that afflicts his later works.  Mr. X has it's detractors, but it's a good example of his style, which frequently involves the history and entwined lives of a small town. Plus I kinda dig it's weirdness.  Floating Dragon might be his most balls-out horror novel. He was taking a break from the genre for a few years, and he wrote it as a valentine to the genre."
stephenking,2ubktc,LozziWithALongO,2,Sat Jan 31 18:27:27 2015 UTC,"Floating Dragon, The Hellfire Club, Koko, Magic Terror, Mr. X and Mystery. I was gonna go for Floating Dragon first and by your comment that sounds like a good idea."
stephenking,2ubktc,justpicksomethin,2,Sat Jan 31 19:04:33 2015 UTC,"The Hellfire Club is great, but it's one of his books that I feel might have been edited down a lot. There's some intimations of supernatural stuff going on, but it never confirms it or gets into it, really.  Mystery has my favorite character from a Straub book, but it's part of the Blue Rose trilogy(Koko, Mystery, The Throat). I think it's the one that stands on its own the best, so you probably don't have to read all of them first."

This may seem like a weird and/or stupid question, but season/weather theme seems to go with Mr. Mercedes? Like, for example, Misery would be Winter, Christine would be Summer, Under the Dome would be fall.  I like pairing up King books with the season they mention most, not really sure why, but it's extremely satisfying to read about piles of snow and be able to look outside to see those piles."

It's one of the best books to go into without knowing exactly what it's about, because - to be fair - it's a twist on old cliche horror stories, but with the delicious King flair.

stephenking,2u0ap8,FortBalsac,3,Thu Jan 29 16:36:03 2015 UTC,"I agree, the villains really became less threatening towards the end, though I sort of let myself become anxious about the ending in hopes of some kind of twist or devastating event. Nope, the ending was one big ""Well that was easy"""
stephenking,2u0ap8,mutterfunker,2,Thu Jan 29 18:46:35 2015 UTC,"You know that happens in a lot of King books though. The villain is growing weaker and weaker as time goes on, but gets more desperate and as a result more dangerous... yeah this one didn't really achieve that as well though."
stephenking,2u0ap8,LoneMantiss,3,Thu Jan 29 22:52:04 2015 UTC,"I guess I assumed the True Knot would become more unpredictable as a result of becoming weak with desperation, like you said, but in retrospect it was all pretty linear. I was riding on the idea of ""Maybe King will punish us in the end for being so comfortable with the good guys!"" until it ended."
stephenking,2u0ap8,mutterfunker,2,Fri Jan 30 04:00:07 2015 UTC,"I guess Abra just unleashed her otherwordly Shining-powers. Dan compares his Shining (a flashlight) with her's (a light house). They just underestimated Abra, all of those steam vampires."

stephenking,2u0xs3,4verticals,3,Thu Jan 29 00:27:02 2015 UTC,"A solid King effort, but in terms of the late 80s/early 90s period, I prefer Four Past Midnight and Needful Things.  Again it's solid, but if you want to read essential King, then I'd go with The Stand first."
stephenking,2u0xs3,cmbrugh,2,Thu Jan 29 02:14:29 2015 UTC,"It was the first Stephen King book I read that I enjoyed so much I started seeking out his other works, However, I read it a long time ago and that's about all I remember about it."
stephenking,2u0xs3,arch_maniac,2,Thu Jan 29 02:52:35 2015 UTC,"It reads like a mix between Bachman and King, which fits, given its subject.   I'd say that tonally, this book has quite a bit in common with The Regulators (another Bachman book). Something about the violence in Bachman books is always more ... blunt and boxy, whereas with King it always feels (to me) more descriptive and less about gore.  Anyway, the book is really good, and it knows it can't sustain a 700+ page narrative, so it's a fairly quick read (I think it's only about 400 pages long)."

stephenking,2tufqh,SpcAgentOrange,2,Thu Jan 29 00:15:56 2015 UTC,"You'll be fine. Honestly, I don't consider The Stand to be one of SK's better works. Maybe I'm a fucking asshole, but it seemed a bit trite at times. I do like how it ties in with his universe, and since I'd read it after the Dark Tower compendium it did compel me. I don't intend to read it again, though."

You have good taste, yo."

stephenking,2twq2t,frostwinter,2,Wed Jan 28 05:34:17 2015 UTC,"Same my friend, I have Doctor Sleep, super duper stoked to re-read The Shining and get into them.  Also quick question, I have never really found The Shining overly scary. Can you tell me why people poop their pants over it?"
stephenking,2twq2t,_rrp_,2,Fri Jan 30 04:10:02 2015 UTC,"Until this month, my only exposure to the Shining has been the movie. And my opinion of the movie didn't sway me enough to try the source material for another 25 years. Here's the thing: the book is great. It goes a lot further in the explanation of what the Shining is. The hotel is pure evil incarnate, and Jack Torrance isn't even insane until he arrives there (unlike the movie where it's debatable that Nicholson is just looney from the get-go).  It's a quick read, and it really is some of King's best horror work, imho.   Joe Hill's Locke and Key is phenomenal btw. Nice to see you're a fan. :-)"

stephenking,2twq2t,_rrp_,1 point,Wed Jan 28 13:47:58 2015 UTC,I agree. Christine is probably one of the few exceptions where the Movie is much better than the book.

Once done, begin the Dark Tower series. So many sirens and bells will be going off in your head. It makes the series SOOOOOOO much more enjoyable."
stephenking,2twq2t,LemonCaterpie,1 point,Wed Jan 28 18:38:44 2015 UTC,I really wish that I hadn't started with TDT. I didn't realize how connected everything was until I finished the series.

Kings' homage to Romero. I found it pretty easy to plow through and meaty enough, although it's no ""The Stand"".  Otherwise, Dreamcatcher is a bit of a cross between Stand by Me and It Came from Outer Space. Also, From a Buick 8.  Another fine read that's no heavyweight but consuming all the same.  Whatever you choose, happy reading"
stephenking,2twq2t,Shashu,4,Thu Jan 29 07:09:54 2015 UTC,"It's not that popular, but ""Gerald's Game"" was very entertaining for me. You'll like it if you expect a psychological thriller more than pure horror."

stephenking,2twq2t,Shashu,2,Fri Jan 30 03:53:56 2015 UTC,I thought Misery was fantastic. I can also recommend The Shining and then Doctor Sleep.
stephenking,2twq2t,FortBalsac,2,Wed Jan 28 03:19:00 2015 UTC,"Lisey's Story was whimsical and weird and really good.    11/22/63 is maybe my favorite alongside The Stand.  Epic and personal and like a grand, important journey in a book."
stephenking,2twq2t,arch_maniac,2,Wed Jan 28 06:27:42 2015 UTC,"I'm reading Lisey's Story right now and I am enjoying it now that I am getting further into it. I read in another thread a redditor wondered if it would be more appealing to someone who has been in a long (>20 year)relationship and I suspect that might be the case. Being married for 25 years, I can relate and appreciate Lisey's bond with Scott and all his demons. All I can say though, is the ending better be good.   I have read most of what he has written, starting with Carrie and Salem's Lot and just finished up reading 11/22/63 for the second time last week (love that book). The only books of his I just can't get into are the Dark Tower Series. I would like to but the fact that it is fantasy scares me off.   I could go on about his short stories and other books but really, as the previous poster said, just pick one you haven't read, read it, enjoy it."
stephenking,2twq2t,arch_maniac,1 point,Thu Jan 29 00:15:04 2015 UTC,"How far exactly have you gotten in the Dark Tower series? The Gunslinger is sort of a hard read compared to the rest, and even King himself has said (paraphrasing here) that when he was writing it, he sort of lost focus on telling the story and was trying more to impress the reader. That's part of why he revised it for the new edition(s).  If you haven't gotten past the Gunslinger, I recommend powering through it, and continuing the rest of the series. Since you've read most of his works, you'll REALLY dig the connections."
stephenking,2twq2t,lessthanstarwars,1 point,Thu Jan 29 14:02:27 2015 UTC,The thought has crossed my mind to give the Dark Series a go as I have been on a Stephen King glom this winter and am running out of his other materials to read. I didn't realize there were connections to his other books so that is encouraging. I was always under the impression that the series was a foray into fantasy--a genre I just don't like as a rule. Thanks.
stephenking,2tsbiw,TheFullMonty1394,13,Tue Jan 27 00:58:28 2015 UTC,I've read it so many times. It's deep and wonderful Gothic horror. The characters... Wireman's story. Edgar's...
stephenking,2tsbiw,cates,4,Tue Jan 27 03:08:41 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I haven't been this attached to a group of charaters since It or The Shining. The books is so good, I like how he leaves each of the paintings up to the imagination of the reader but gives enough of a basis to know what he is talking about.   I'm almost at the big bad final showdown and I honestly couldn;t be more nervous about what will happen to my friends. THis book is always going to be a re-read for me."
stephenking,2tsbiw,EvelJim,11,Tue Jan 27 05:30:32 2015 UTC,I loved the book and I really recommend the audiobook.  John Slattery's narration is phenomenal.

stephenking,2tsbiw,FortBalsac,2,Tue Jan 27 03:09:19 2015 UTC,"Most definitely. The book feels like a fresh take on horror and the characters in it have never been better. Especially after some of the stuff of his that has come out in the early 2000's, this book is like a fresh gust of air, rolling in off the Gulf."

stephenking,2tidv7,RetroPalace,2,Sat Jan 24 17:40:23 2015 UTC,I'm about to finish book IV of the Dark Tower series; I can already feel how sad I'm going to be finishing the saga.  :'(  You should enjoy IT if you like horror films.  It's not a saga exactly like DT or The Stand; it feels like a more accurate (drawn out) representation of what it's like to be a kid with fear.  Definitely in my top 2 favorite SK books along with The Stand.  I love IT much more than the Shining and King's recent books; hope you enjoy it!

I just recently reread it after reading it in the second grade and being terrified out of my mind. now at 33 - I didn't find it scary at all - but I found it incredibly poetic and just a beautiful story of friendship and history - he just has a way with weaving the stories together - the monster part was such a small part of the book for me with all the histories of the people and the coming together. And of course Beverly becomes one BAD ASS B@#$%

I always assumed it would be lame seeing it as an adult since it was made for TV.  Maybe I should give it shot."
stephenking,2tdo2o,KuchDaddy,2,Fri Jan 23 16:35:24 2015 UTC,"It has some faults but some great aspects too. The vampire makeup is great, very few-days-old-corpse like, and I like the Varney the Vampire type dully shining tin eyes. Barlow's Nosferatu look is great too, except his fangs noticeably wiggle when he pops into frame in the kid's house. Some really well directed creepy ass scenes throughout the movie as well, notably the little brother vamp floating outside the windows.   Shouldn't bee too much of a surprise that it has redeeming qualities considering Tobe Hooper directed."
stephenking,2tdo2o,RomanSenate,2,Fri Jan 23 18:25:18 2015 UTC,"The acting is a product of the times, but if you can appreciate it for what it is and when it was made it is still a great TV miniseries.  To this day when Mike and Floyd are driving the truck and the crate with Barlow in it keeps moving closer to them is scary-great. Also Ralphie and Danny Glick scratching at the window is creepy as hell!.  I was also twelve when this came out."

The contrast in writing style was evident in the careful maturity of an older, wiser King but I liked the driven intensity of the Shining.  I should pick it back up..."
stephenking,2t5lf5,GaijinSama,7,Wed Jan 21 19:24:55 2015 UTC,"Full Dark, No Stars was a pretty interesting book. Not all of the four novellas(think Different Seasons) were successful, but they all felt like he was pushing himself to experiment more.  Just After Sunset is probably my least favorite of his short story collections, but it also has N, which is one of my favorite shorts he's ever done.  Joyland was good, but I felt it's supernatural elements were shoe-horned in in order to satisfy what people expect from him. The story itself doesn't need the supernatural, and is better when it's just the story of a kid getting over heartbreak while working at an amusement park.  His other Hard Case Crime book, The Colorado Kid, however, is one of the best things I think he's ever done. I love its unsolvable mystery, and it's haunting in a great way(because you'll keep trying to puzzle out what happened).  And, sidebar, has anyone else read any other Hard Case Crime books? I can't recommend The Twenty Year Death by Ariel Winter enough. That book is fucking amazing. I know it's not Stephen King, but I just like to plug that book when I can."
stephenking,2t5lf5,butter_wizard,2,Thu Jan 22 01:23:47 2015 UTC,I read 4 or 5 hard case crime books but had to give up trying. A lot of false advertising: half the books weren't even crime novels.
stephenking,2t5lf5,GaijinSama,2,Wed Jan 21 12:32:11 2015 UTC,"I highly recommend Twenty Year Death. It's basically three books in one, each spanning a different decade and written in the style of a popular mystery writer of the time(Georges Simenon, Raymond Chandler, and Jim Thompson), each of which tell one big story while also being complete stories on their own."
stephenking,2t5lf5,butter_wizard,2,Wed Jan 21 20:43:56 2015 UTC,"I heard good things about that one. I basically just did a lucky dip, picking random ones that were available.. there was Memory by Donald Westlake, which he supposedly wrote and shelved for 30 years. Reading it, all I could think was ""Wow, no wonder he didn't want this published."" And it wasn't even a crime novel!   There was another, Diet of Treacle, which read like Catcher in the Rye spread out over three people. No crime in that, either."
stephenking,2t5lf5,SlendersSuit,2,Wed Jan 21 21:44:36 2015 UTC,You might enjoy the L.A. Quartet by James Ellroy if you're looking for noir.  It starts with The Black Dahlia.

It's sort of faded from memory for a lot of people.  Maybe because it come out just before the last three Dark Towers.  Maybe because King had already done a magic car book.  But it's a good one.  If you liked the Texas school stuff in 11/22/63, you'll like Buick 8.  It has a very similar ensemble cast sort of feel to it."

It's almost as if the words are just there, in my mind somewhere, existing, fading/rushing into one another. If I think about reading there is a voice. Or rather, there are many voices. Each character (major character, anyway) has a very strong voice for me. They aren't always speaking, though. Like I said, sometimes the words just sort of fly though my brain into places that go beyond pictures and more into feelings. When I'm reading, it's all like a vague memory that I can recall with vivid clarity as the words pass through my consciousness."

Very fucking cool because I never really had nightmares of fictional characters before. In one of them I narrowly escaped my house from something scary and then I somehow was called to some saloon in the middle of nowhere. In the saloon Pennywise was ""disguised"" wearing a stereotypical noir detectives jacket and a huge fedora.... he was telling me he was going to kill my kid since I escaped. I don't even have kids or have even dreamt of having any. Then in another I was a child on a farm with friends I don't think I've ever had... Pennywise was a bull charging at us. We ran to the chickenwire fence and barely got away. Farm kid's dad checked up on us because he heard us screaming... then Pennywise transformed into a raven and pecked the dad's face off. It was very graphic. Started pulling an eye out... the dad was screaming bloody murder. I can't remember ever having a dream that was graphic before that. Then my third dream I can't really recall at all but I was in a gas station or pharmacy and somehow noticed that the cashier was a masquerade and Pennywise gave me look that told me he knew that I knew. Similar to Bev's scenario ""if they know that I know then I'm fucked"".  It's the first book of King's that I've gone through. Never before has a story infected my dreams like that. Kudos to him."

stephenking,2t0xxl,KicksButtson,7,Tue Jan 20 06:21:03 2015 UTC,"But despite all the changes made you should still try to stay loyal to the purpose of the story. If the story has a certain meaning or moral lesson then perhaps that shouldn't change, especially when the meaning behind the source material is very near and dear to the author's heart and he's still alive.   But WHY? That's simply your own definition of what an adaptation should be. That doesn't mean every filmmaker should follow that rule. Kubrick liked certain aspects of the story and put it in the film. The rest, he left out and made it his own. There's NOTHING wrong with that. You're giving King too much credit.  Films are a form of art. Directors, writers, actors, editors, cinematographers, composers, etc. can do whatever the fuck they want with a book they have the rights to. They can tell the story from the ending to beginning and still call it an adaptation of the book. They can make the protagonist do the complete opposite of what he/she did in the book and call it an adaptation. To say that the film lacks quality because it does not resonate and have similar themes like in the book is completely idiotic. It's just bad film criticism.  I'm a fan of both King and Kubrick. Why can't we just appreciate these two different forms of art and acknowledge that they're both very good in their own very ways? Is that too much to ask?"
stephenking,2t0xxl,JakeMakesSteaks,1 point,Tue Jan 20 21:13:14 2015 UTC,"""That's simply your own definition of what an adaptation should be.""   Filmmaking is a form of storytelling, and while storytelling may be an artform it's by far one of the strictest. Unlike a canvas which you can just sling paint at, you can't just throw random things at a story and make it work.  And it's one thing to say the director can have artistic license with the story, it's another thing to say he should completely alter the story in such a way that misrepresents the source material and disrespects the original creator and his family.   ""You're giving King too much credit""   I already explained I'm not a King purist, that I understood the importance of making changes to adapt a story for the silver screen, and that even King himself has since come to terms with that fact.   One of the things I like about King's work is that it's not perfect, for instance he has a problem with going off on tangents and rambling. He also sometimes injects informal folk phrases that don't exist which can really take a reader out of the moment. Not to mention his ability to write a good ending is usually severely hindered due to his rambling. By the time he's reached the ending on a thousand page novel he's gone so far off the deep end it's hard to get back on track.   ""Films are a form of art. Directors, writers, actors, editors, cinematographers, composers, etc. can do whatever the fuck they want with a book they have the rights to""   Legally they can, but we've seen time and time again how other franchises have been ruined by directors who try to do their own thing. But by your logic then no one can say anything bad about any adaptation ever because the director has the right to do whatever he wants because he's an artist and how dare we criticize his art.  In the most general sense Architecture is an art form, but what kind of brdges would be built if people felt the same about architecture as you do about other forms of art? Maybe the Golden Gate Bridge would just be for show and not actually able to hold any actual weight. Why? Because it's pretty to look at and the artist can do what he wants, nevermind the intended purpose of a bridge.    ""To say that the film lacks quality because it does not resonate and have similar themes like in the book is completely idiotic""   I don't think the film is bad because it doesn't stick to the themes of the book. Technically the themes are the same, it's the meaning behind the actions that are different. Otherwise the theme of both is isolation horror. I think the film is bad because Kubrick's finished product lacks a coherent story, the characters are too static, and and the ending makes no sense at all.  Plus, on its own I think the film is just adequate at best. The problem is that people claim this film is penacle of horror, when in reality it's just a film with some good visuals and a creepy atmosphere. There's no actual horror payoff and the story is more confusing than scary. I can see how kids might be frightened by this, and originally that's how the movie got its following.  Originally The Shining get a very good response from critics and audience members. The film was no doubt creepy, but the story didn't make sense and the characters were dull throughout most of the story. Shortly after release the film seemed to be a mild flop.   Only later on when kids began to see it did the movie get any positive feedback. At that time kids would sneak into horror films and then tell all their buddies at school about how scary it was, then more kids would go see it. The film gained a cult following and when it finally came out on VHS the film was extremely popular.   People who saw this film as kids rememebr it being one of the most frightening movies they've ever seen, and that nostalgia is hard to overcome with logic. Adults saw through the shiny vineer of Kubrick's visuals to realize the film wasn't that good because they didn't have that nostalgia to fall back on.  It's also pretty common that films get more credit than they deserve just because they're visually appealing when the story is subpar. Each year at the Oscars the films with the most visual candy are front runners even when the story is worthy of a Razzie. Rememebr the film The English Patient? That film is widely acknowledged as being one of the worst stories in recent cinema history, and complete with some of the most terrible characters who are somehow labelled as the protagonists just because they're in forbidden love. But the film was visually appealing so it cleaned house at the awards ceremonies. Everyone was too afraid to not say good things about the film because the film was so ""artistic"" they were worried that criticizing it would make them seem incapable of comprehending the depth of the art.  Critics themselves are very susceptible to this kind of visual trickery because they spend their entire lives watching mostly blockbuster crap like Transformers and The Fast & The Furious so when a visually stunning artistic film comes their way they're suddenly so happy to be watching something that isn't a Michael Bay orgasm that they get wrapped up in their glee and fail to realize the basic technical failings of the film.   ""Why can't we just appreciate these two different forms of art and acknowledge that they're both very good in their own very ways?""   Are there any film adaptations you dislike? Any films based on comics, video games, television shows, or books that you found to be subpar or even bad? Perhaps you disliked them because they strayed too far from the purpose and/or meaning of the source material. Or maybe you simply disliked them for technical failures like bad acting, poor writing, or a simple misuse of plot devices...  Why can't you just appreciate them for their artistic merit and admit they're actually very good in their own way?... Maybe it's because they're not and you know it.  People only use the ""it's art and cannot effectively be analyzed or criticized"" defense when it's something they love and don't like to hear torn down. But when it's something they dislike they have no problem with criticizing it and forgetting all about their defense of the artform.  The truth is that art is mostly conceptual, or at least it's a manifestation of ideas. And just because you have the freedom to think whatever you want doesn't mean the things you think (and the works which derive from your thoughts) aren't subject to criticism. You have the right to think and create (which you so loosely label as art because you think it protects your ideas) and the rest of us have the right to criticize the shit out of you ideas, especially when they end up on the silver screen asking for our patronage and attempting to turn a profit."

stephenking,2sxtqn,largetuna326,6,Mon Jan 19 21:23:23 2015 UTC,"It also has possibly my favorite bit of writing by King.  “You may wonder about long-term solutions. I assure you, there are none. All wounds are mortal. Take what's given. You sometimes get a little slack in the rope but the rope always has an end. So what? Bless the slack and don't waste your breath cursing the drop. A grateful heart knows that in the end we all swing.”"
stephenking,2sxtqn,TheDanimal438,3,Mon Jan 19 22:03:00 2015 UTC,The Man in the Black Suit is probably one of my absolute favorites. There's just something about the way it's told and the way the man is described.
stephenking,2sxtqn,KicksButtson,2,Tue Jan 20 02:26:12 2015 UTC,Agreed. It's a very creepy story and I always thought one of King's strengths as a writer was capturing the language of certain time period. The way the characters speak in this story easily puts me into the turn of the century setting this takes place in.
stephenking,2sxtqn,TheDanimal438,10,Tue Jan 20 12:28:54 2015 UTC,The Jaunt is by far the scariest short he has done.
stephenking,2sxtqn,gilligan2346,2,Mon Jan 19 16:45:15 2015 UTC,Not just the scariest but one of the finest short stories of any author ever.
stephenking,2sxtqn,Phifty2,2,Mon Jan 19 21:23:31 2015 UTC,Agree. The Jaunt is #1 on my list.
stephenking,2sxtqn,Moses_Scurry,6,Tue Jan 20 02:21:23 2015 UTC,Probably hard to come up with a list that everyone will agree on because there are so many good ones but I think it's a good list. Glad to see The Road Virus on there. Always loved that one.
stephenking,2sxtqn,BlackArtsTattooer,5,Mon Jan 19 17:27:02 2015 UTC,"Totally agree.   One of my pet fears is paintings that change, and that story delivered in spades."
stephenking,2sxtqn,Shalamarr,5,Mon Jan 19 17:39:18 2015 UTC,"To me a lot of these are thuddingly average. Children of the Corn, The Reach, The Monkey, and Jerusalem's Lot all slid off my brain like teflon. I think it's criminal that The Last Rung on the Ladder isn't here."

stephenking,2sxtqn,aikodude,4,Mon Jan 19 20:32:29 2015 UTC,im reading Night Shift now and I didn't like Night Surf all that much. surprised its on the list.

stephenking,2sxtqn,BasketeerOverHere,3,Mon Jan 19 19:40:39 2015 UTC,No love for The Long Walk? I still can't get that story out of my head.  I also agree with Mrs. Todd's Shortcut and The Jaunt being among the best.
stephenking,2sxtqn,Honeythorn_Gump,5,Mon Jan 19 20:24:43 2015 UTC,"I would have picked The Long Walk, as well as Rage and Apt Pupil, but I think they may be classified as novellas and not exactly short stories."
stephenking,2sxtqn,mommy2libras,2,Mon Jan 19 21:24:48 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with most of those. I enjoy more of the psych horror than the monster/boogeyman type stories, although there are a few of those I do like.  I did like The Moving Finger. It was pretty comical and then you have the ending.   The Raft was a nice one, I thought, as well as Home Delivery, although I don't know if they'd have made a ""top"" list if I made one.  I would rather Chattery Teeth be there than The Monkey.  But it seems odd that so many good ones just aren't there. Like have been mentioned her, The Jaunt, Mrs. Todd's Shortcut and Everything's Eventual were great stories and at least one should be on this list, or The Ballad of the Flexible Bullet.   Personally,  The Ten O'Clock People has always been a favorite of mine and that's not usually my ""type"" of story. The End of the Whole Mess, Survivor Type and Willa are others I enjoyed but rarely see mentioned. And of course,  You Know They Have a Hell of a Band. That's stuck with me since I first read it as a teenager."
stephenking,2sxtqn,mommy2libras,2,Mon Jan 19 21:23:21 2015 UTC,"The Raft, The Monkey, The Road Virus Heads North and The Man in the Black Suit, okay.  I'd have moved The Moving Finger up a few places, the way that was written was just brilliant.  The others, eh.  To fill the blanks: Crouch End, Everything's Eventual, Lunch at the Gotham Cafe, 1408, All That You Love Will be Carried Away, Dolan's Cadillac, The Doctor's Case, Gramma, and The Mist."
stephenking,2sxtqn,city17_dweller,2,Mon Jan 19 21:51:52 2015 UTC,"Like the inclusion of Sometimes They Come Back, The Raft, Night Surf, The Road Virus Heads North and Man In The Black Suit. Would have included Nona, Quitters Inc, I Know What You Need and Survivor Type."

I think that ""Dolan's Cadillac,"" ""Everything's Eventual,"" ""Popsy,"" ""The Jaunt,"" and ""Survivor Type"" definitely should've been on the list.

The idea that they have been waiting there for us rarely crosses our minds.

stephenking,2sj4b7,YogiLeBua,12,Fri Jan 16 05:40:39 2015 UTC,For me it was when Ben was walking home from school and saw It on the frozen river. It was such a vivid scene for me. And it fueled the most horrifying nightmare I've ever had. So. I was basically in the same situation but I looked and it was Slenderman standing there. I blinked and he was holding a balloon. I blinked again and he had big orange pompoms on his suit. Blinked a third and final time and I saw Pennywise laughing and waving and beckoning me over to him. I woke up in a cold sweat.

I was 12 when I read IT, and the idea that from that moment on her bathroom was that closely associated with IT just terrified me. It just seemed so intimate and inescapable (where else would she pee?!!). Plus she's alone in her fear -- yes, she's got her friends, but she lives with her parents so she might as well be alone."
stephenking,2sj4b7,Malfi,11,Thu Jan 15 17:56:49 2015 UTC,"I always thought Beverly's was the scariest because it preyed on something she couldn't get away from: the closer she got to womanhood, the more abusive and crazy her father was going to get."

The threat of it going beyond that, or just plain becoming more brutal, was worse than what a lot of the other kids dealt with.

stephenking,2sj4b7,justanothersong,8,Thu Jan 15 19:54:53 2015 UTC,I think Stan's experience with the dead kids in the Standpipe was the scariest one. He seemed to have the closest shave with death as well as that horrible imagery of the drowned corpses of the children and how they died.

Whatever It is beyond what we see, this representation is at least symbolically correct: It’s female, and It’s pregnant. . . . It was pregnant then and none of us knew except Stan, oh Jesus Christ YES, it was Stan, Stan, not Mike, Stan who understood, Stan who told us. . . . That’s why we had to come back, no matter what, because It is female, It’s pregnant with some unimaginable spawn . . . and Its time has drawn close."

I had a similar moment when Mike went to the park where Eddie Corcoran's blood was all over the place leading to the Canal. When Eddie was pursued by the creature from the Black Lagoon, he could smell rotting fish and the ocean as IT was gaining on him, and while Mike was piecing the story together, he started smelling the same thing Eddie did before he died. But luckily Mike broke his paralysis and left in time.  It's things like that that just give me shivers."

The town knew Beverly's father was an abusive drunk, and did nothing. Patrick's father knew on some level that his son had killed his infant, and did nothing. The Denbroughs ignored their bullied son in the wake of the younger boy's death. The town ignored the burning of the Black Spot. The pharmacist knew Eddie's mother's was smothering him and forcing him to believe he had asthma but didn't do anything beyond trying to talk to the boy. They knew Henry Bowers was a powder keg and let it go.  The way they turned a blind eye was what allowed IT to take root. Always left me unsettled.

I understand why people have problems with the end of the series, but here's my defense; SK had no idea what he was going to do with the Dark Tower stories for most of his career. He's admitted he just wrote the books when he wanted to spend some time with the characters. Nothing wrong with that, but it just felt so aimless for those first 4 books(and aside from the first one, those are lengthy books). He just kept spinning his wheels, writing about the characters with no real point in mind. As divisive as the final three books are, at least they have forward momentum. There's an ending in sight and the whole story is moving towards it."
stephenking,2shv0o,m0llywobbles,7,Thu Jan 15 15:43:45 2015 UTC,That is definitely an unpopular opinion. Vote this to the top.

stephenking,2shv0o,Miranda_is_amazing7,12,Fri Jan 16 07:58:10 2015 UTC,"I think his best book is probably Hearts in Atlantis. (The Stand is close, but this isn't exactly unpopular.) Everybody has opinions about its theme, and I think i somewhat agree with it being about the shortcomings of the baby boomer generation, but what I really got out of it was a feeling of loss and yearning. I think I fell a little in love with Carol. In that vein, I'd put Joyland at around #3 or #4. Blew away my expectations. On the other hand, I thought Pet Semetary was pretty darn bad. I need to reread it, but I was very disappointed and didn't think it was as scary as it was anticlimactic. It's probably in my bottom 5. I actually liked Tommyknockers more, and most people don't like that. I couldn't even finish Different Seasons. I got some way through ""Apt Pupil"" and just never finished. IT is pretty good, but super overrated. Maybe top ten, but the fact that people think it's a better epic than The Stand just blows my mind. Don't know if this is unpopular, but his worst in my opinion was easily Roadwork.  I like Cell, though I get the impression I might be the only one.   In response to yours: Duma Key was one of my favorites, but would've been higher if there was no horror in it. Them going to the house at the end was alright, but just didn't match up to the rest of the book. I wanted an 800-page book about his recovery from the accident, living on the beach and painting. The part was just unbelievably captivating.  I think King is at his best when writing about ordinary life stuff: some college kids dealing with shit in HiA, a guy working at an amusement park and finding out he makes a good mascot in Joyland, a guy discovering his love for painting in Duma Key, and life in the late '50s in 11/22/63."
stephenking,2shv0o,_Ka_Tet_,6,Thu Jan 15 16:34:39 2015 UTC,I completely agree with you about Hearts in Atlantis. It's just told so well and the characters are so human. For a long time it was my favorite.   Im surprised you didnt like different seasons and road work. I felt those were both more along the lines of normal people in somewhat different situations. I loved both of them.
stephenking,2shv0o,moneypocket,3,Thu Jan 15 17:20:37 2015 UTC,"I have no explanation for Different Seasons, I just couldn't get through it. Apt Pupil never captured my interest and I didn't care enough to power through it to get to the last two.  Roadwork was very well written, but it is the only book I've ever read that was too depressing to enjoy. It just made me sad."
stephenking,2shv0o,wiihtiko,4,Thu Jan 15 19:21:08 2015 UTC,"I listened to Cell audio book, I liked it a lot."
stephenking,2shv0o,Azazael,3,Thu Jan 15 19:33:49 2015 UTC,"How dare you!?  Pet Sematary is really disturbing!  Lol I liked it, but outside of the Internet having an opinion isn't unpopular. Don't read into it."
stephenking,2shv0o,1859,2,Thu Jan 15 21:46:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was really scared by Pet Sematary too. I think what really struck me was how well he painted the desperation of the people who wanted their family members back.   Anything has the potential to be written horribly, but Stephen King seems to rise above that temptation."
stephenking,2shv0o,CanadianStoner72,3,Sat Jan 17 04:30:39 2015 UTC,"I liked Cell. I think IT may be more about the emotional connection. If you ever had a group of older kids out to get you, IT speaks to you."
stephenking,2shv0o,CanadianStoner72,2,Thu Jan 15 22:34:36 2015 UTC,"That definitely make sense - and don't get me wrong, I though IT was VERY good. And the parts with Ben being tormented, and really his entire childhood story, form one of my favorite of King's narratives. But I think it just shouldn't be up there with The Stand, The Shining and 'Salem's Lot."
stephenking,2shv0o,JustJim83,3,Thu Jan 15 22:39:57 2015 UTC,"Personally I enjoyed IT because the characters were so emotionally rich, Ben, Beverly, Bill, hey even he crazy guy they grew up with and came back to try to kill them.   Plus I feel like King had a great way to bring the supernatural to the story- through the magic that childhood brings. I related to it on a personal level because of that- the world always seems a bit brighter when you're that age and I felt like he represented that really well."
stephenking,2shv0o,CanadianStoner72,2,Sat Jan 17 04:29:01 2015 UTC,"I think it has a lot of depth. Becoming an adult means overcoming childhood fears and imagined injuries. The pocket knife scene was what locked me in. I had a group of older kids grab me and hold me while one of them threatened to burn my face with a cigarette. When I looked back, my conviction at the time was firm that they would do it. As an adult, it's easy to see that it was all bravado."
stephenking,2shv0o,TheFullMonty1394,2,Thu Jan 15 22:44:12 2015 UTC,I disagree about road work. I hated it for the first half of the book then after the second half I re read the first and now its in my top 3 favs.  Hearts in atlantis for boring imo   It's nice to see a different perspective though :)

stephenking,2shv0o,mysteries1984,6,Thu Jan 15 14:55:18 2015 UTC,"I absolutely cannot stand the movie adaptations. I hate most of them with a passion. After seeing The Mist, I was so mad I swore I'd never watch another adaptation. I can't enjoy a movie if all I'm doing is sitting there wanting to bitch about ""that wasn't in the book!""  My issues with the movies aren't just the things that get changed and left out (some of it quite important), it's also the cast selection. Gary Sinise?! As Stu Redman?! No. Josh Brolin, almost definitely, but not Sinise. And Molly Ringwald is a terrible actress. She's no Frannie.   Speaking of The Stand, does anyone know what's happening with that? Last I heard, Affleck was out as director, which is disappointing, because having him on board had me a bit interested in maybe breaking my no more adaptations vow.   Edit: left a word out"

stephenking,2shv0o,BeardleySmith,2,Thu Jan 15 23:03:14 2015 UTC,So it's not just a rumour that McConaughey will play Flagg then? That should be interesting!
stephenking,2shv0o,littlered2,3,Fri Jan 16 16:07:05 2015 UTC,but...the ending to the Mist!
stephenking,2shv0o,mysteries1984,3,Fri Jan 16 09:29:11 2015 UTC,"I think there's a lot of emotional complexity and internal dialogue that makes his novels awesome, which is usually the biggest item on the list of things that upset me about the movie adaptation.   Have you seen Secret Window? I thought they did a decent job on it."
stephenking,2shv0o,NoeJose,3,Sat Jan 17 04:39:53 2015 UTC,I thought they did an excellent job on that one! I even have a bit of a preference for the way the movie ended over the story. Johnny Depp was definitely a good choice to play Mort.
stephenking,2shv0o,mysteries1984,2,Sat Jan 17 16:03:57 2015 UTC,"I read somewhere that King doesn't mind most of the tv and movie adaptations of his work because he doesn't consider the content ""his"" anymore.  Probably best for his sanity.  I know he hated Kubrick's Shining, and wasn't particularly proud of Maximum Overdrive.  He did like the movie ending of The Mist better than his own, though."
stephenking,2shv0o,NoeJose,2,Thu Jan 15 16:38:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've read some of that, too. I actually really liked Maximum Overdrive. I saw it before reading Trucks, and I can honestly say I like them both equally. I wasn't aware he liked the movie ending of The Mist better than his. I think his was much better, but I kind of like the ambiguous endings.   As for The Stand? I know he wrote the teleplay, and that's one I'd like to slap him a bit for. When I watched it on TV, I thought it was great. Watched it again a couple of years ago with my mom, and the best part about watching it was criticizing it. We both thought it was terrible."
stephenking,2shv0o,SGT_BUTTSTICK,4,Thu Jan 15 20:05:11 2015 UTC,"I don't know how unpopular it is, but I think Danse Macabre is one of the best things King ever did. It's also the best book about horror that I've ever read."
stephenking,2shv0o,theQub3,1 point,Thu Jan 15 15:12:53 2015 UTC,I've never really heard much about Danse Macabre; what did you like about it?
stephenking,2shv0o,mysteries1984,3,Thu Jan 15 16:36:11 2015 UTC,"It's a great overview of horror in film, literature, radio, and television in the 20th century (some 19th century stuff, too). I guess I like it because King is such an affable person, especially when he is writing to (not for) his Constant Readers. It's just a really great treatise on the history and the impact that horror as a genre has had on our world.   He also touches on a lot of his own autobiographical information in the book, which is an added bonus as a King fan."
stephenking,2shv0o,_Ka_Tet_,2,Thu Jan 15 19:51:02 2015 UTC,Hmmm.  You may have just put that book next on my list to read.
stephenking,2shv0o,bizzycarl,2,Thu Jan 15 20:14:59 2015 UTC,"I loved Rose Madder too!  Like Duma Key, I read it when I was going through some very tough times, and reading those books was its own form of therapy.  Plus I could totally relate to the main character of Rose Madder."
stephenking,2shv0o,_Ka_Tet_,8,Thu Jan 15 21:48:09 2015 UTC,I don't like the Dark Tower series.  I'll give it another try at some point but I just couldn't get into it.
stephenking,2shv0o,bizzycarl,4,Thu Jan 15 22:14:49 2015 UTC,I completely agree I read the first book in the series and it took me over a month where as most of his novels take me less than a week. I had to force myself to keep picking it up even though I didn't really want to but I couldn't leave it unfinished.
stephenking,2shv0o,GaijinSama,6,Thu Jan 15 12:04:32 2015 UTC,"You should really read the second book, that will be a much better way to judge whether you like the series.  The first book is tough. I love it now and appreciate it, but it's definitely a tough start to the series."
stephenking,2shv0o,_Ka_Tet_,2,Thu Jan 15 15:47:02 2015 UTC,"I read the wizard and the glass, I was unaware of DT I just found it in book shop, then went back to read the rest, I wasn't sure about the first book at all, but persevered because the wizard and glass was so good"

stephenking,2shv0o,ProfessorLake,9,Thu Jan 15 21:47:40 2015 UTC,"I did not like Doctor Sleep one bit. There was never any sense that any of the protagonists were in actual danger. Even when captured, they had the upper hand."
stephenking,2shv0o,insuranceis_boring,6,Thu Jan 15 18:25:17 2015 UTC,"I liked Doctor Sleep well enough; it was actually a little refreshing to read a King book without the usual good guy casualties.  You are completely on point, though; there's never any true sense of danger."
stephenking,2shv0o,KicksButtson,2,Thu Jan 15 17:50:08 2015 UTC,I completely agree. It was all build-up...for what?  Just like you said the protagonists were never really in danger it seemed.
stephenking,2shv0o,Shooternick,4,Thu Jan 15 20:19:00 2015 UTC,It seemed like he wanted to write about recovery and sandwiched a Shining sequel around it.
stephenking,2shv0o,foulmouthangel,3,Thu Jan 15 19:14:35 2015 UTC,Bingo!  I totally agree.
stephenking,2shv0o,SpookyGeek,4,Thu Jan 15 19:16:40 2015 UTC,"Except a book about recovery is the perfect idea to sandwich a Shining sequel around. The original was all about self destruction through addiction, making it's sequel about recovery isn't a terrible idea."
stephenking,2shv0o,selxxa,2,Thu Jan 15 20:56:56 2015 UTC,I think the execution was the problem for me. It felt forced.
stephenking,2shv0o,NoeJose,1 point,Thu Jan 15 20:40:38 2015 UTC,"The idea is fine, many of his are but the execution seemed thin and forced to me.  I still enjoyed reading it"

stephenking,2shv0o,talliss,3,Fri Feb 6 10:56:40 2015 UTC,i'm a quarter deep and considering abandoning it

stephenking,2shv0o,Psychopath-,2,Mon Jan 26 05:03:07 2015 UTC,I feel the same way about the protagonists but I loved that book.
stephenking,2shv0o,scottydo423,12,Fri Mar 20 17:22:00 2015 UTC,"Not sure how popular or unpopular this opinion is going to be with the Redditors on this thread, but I think I know how Stephen King would feel about it...  Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"" is not just a piss poor adaptation of King's novel, but it's actually a very poorly told story. It's only real saving grace is that it's got some excellent visuals and Kubrick has an almost cult following. By ""cult"" I mean a group of pious followers with near religious reverence for Kubrick and his work, the bad kind of cult.  Too often a film with a weak story and inconsistent narrative gets a pass just because it's visually appealing. The same sort of thing happened with the film ""The English Patient"" which by all standards of storytelling was an absolutely terrible film, yet was showered with praise just because it tried to be artistic and romantic during Oscar season. These sort of films are what I call ""Critic Bait"" which is a film that appeals to movie critics (either intentionally or unintentionally) only because it's so vastly different than the usual crap that critics are forced to watch all day. If you watch crap by Michael Bay and M Night Shamalan all day then you're likely to have a very positive reaction to a film by Kubrick just because it's not total shit, but you neglect to notice the terrible storytelling and character development of the film because you're too engrossed with the fact that the film isn't total garbage. It's the film equivalent of eating McDonalds after being force fed raw rats all day. You're likely to think McDonalds tastes like gourmet cuisine.  People forget that when Kubrick's ""The Shining"" was first released it didn't get a very good response from critics or audience members. It was an obviously scary movie and mostly adults went rather than kids. But adults didn't get it and couldn't understand the inconsistent story or the terrible and unnecessarily complex ending. People thought it was too slow, and that the so-called ""slow burn"" just didn't lead anywhere truly satisfying.  But like all horror films (especially back then) kids eventually get to see it and a younger audience isn't as concerned with character development or storytelling. They're more interested in the simple things like gore and atmosphere. And while the film may not have much in terms of gore, it has tons of creepy atmosphere. Only with the young did the film gain much of a following, and those kids grew up to think it was the scariest thing they'd ever seen on screen. Nostalgia runs deep, even for bad movies.  The exact details of what is wrong with Kubrick's film will be left for later in case anyone really wants to know, but no one can explain the issues better than King himself."
stephenking,2shv0o,GaijinSama,12,Fri Jan 16 09:22:16 2015 UTC,"I disagree with what you say, but I'll be hatcheted to death for your right to say it."
stephenking,2shv0o,thatinnsmouthlook,8,Thu Jan 15 09:25:48 2015 UTC,This. The first time I saw it I was dazzled by the visuals but each next time I saw it I liked it less and less. It's a bad movie in disguise as a good one.
stephenking,2shv0o,Psychopath-,2,Thu Jan 15 12:13:37 2015 UTC,Perfectly stated.
stephenking,2shv0o,DeepRoast,2,Thu Jan 15 10:56:42 2015 UTC,"Man I agree. I recently rewatched it with some friends. Most of us had read the book so we were excited. I haven't seen it since I read Doctor Sleep so I was VERY excited.  Soooo fucking slow. I know it was partially because I was high, but man it ruined the mood"
stephenking,2shv0o,DeepRoast,3,Thu Jan 15 15:12:55 2015 UTC,"Honestly, despite all my criticisms of ""The Shining"" and Kubrick's other work, it could have been because you were high."
stephenking,2shv0o,Brendan42,1 point,Thu Jan 15 21:18:52 2015 UTC,A round of applause for this post.  Seriously.
stephenking,2shv0o,CoolHeadedLogician,4,Fri Jan 16 02:24:50 2015 UTC,"I feel a lot of his books start with a bang but end with a whimper, Dream Catcher, and Under the Dome. Also I respect that he does not like firearms, but his descriptions of guns are so off it's comical."
stephenking,2shv0o,Brendan42,2,Thu Jan 15 16:47:38 2015 UTC,"I agree. Sometimes when his political opinions, descriptions of the military, guns, etc. make their way into his stories I end up doing a lot of eye rolling."
stephenking,2shv0o,EnIdiot,4,Thu Jan 15 20:04:17 2015 UTC,This opinion is a little different because it would be extremely unpopular with King himself:  I think baseball is incredibly boring.
stephenking,2shv0o,ughalready,5,Thu Jan 15 22:32:53 2015 UTC,Wizard and Glass blows. The Waste Lands was the best.

stephenking,2shv0o,ughalready,2,Thu Jan 15 16:08:13 2015 UTC,but Cuthbert.
stephenking,2shv0o,_Ka_Tet_,3,Thu Jan 15 17:44:36 2015 UTC,I also thought Wizard and Glass was mostly a waste of time between the interesting bits.
stephenking,2shv0o,Onefortheisland,2,Thu Jan 15 22:37:43 2015 UTC,"Pretty much.  King can write decent romance but I just didn't particularly care about any of it. We knew going into the story that it wasn't going to be a happy ending, it felt like a lot of meandering and filler just to get the ending, which I admit was pretty great."
stephenking,2shv0o,m0llywobbles,2,Thu Jan 15 18:27:42 2015 UTC,"Has he ever really written a great romance? It always just seems like wish-fulfillment to me. Like, it's his fantasy idea about romance, but not really what it's like in real life. I loved 11/22/63, but still cringed at some of the romantic bits because they seemed so much like a schmaltzy TV movie."
stephenking,2shv0o,TheFullMonty1394,2,Thu Jan 15 18:36:59 2015 UTC,"Lisey's Story is probably as close as he's gotten to a romantic story and, as someone who hates that genre of fiction, it's one of my favorite books."

stephenking,2shv0o,Miranda_is_amazing7,2,Thu Jan 15 17:08:58 2015 UTC,"I love the book, and I've got mixed feelings about the movie.

Admittedly much of fan fiction sucks and really isn't worth reading, but I remember him saying in an interview that fan fiction essentially was stealing. At the same time, he has borrowed a lot from Lovecraft and the mythos that surrounds the Cthulu Mythos (much of it in turn taken from other writers).  It just seems to me that someone writing something set in the Dark Tower mythos would not enjoy the same level of magnanimity that King himself enjoyed borrowing from the Lovecraftian universe. King, I understand is first and foremost an industry now that he has made it. He has to defend his copyrights and protect his brand. I just wish he would admit that he has done the very thing he has criticized others for doing."
stephenking,2shv0o,Dragonache,6,Mon Jan 26 04:58:17 2015 UTC,"Considering that The Dark Tower is essentially fan fiction for a poem, yes, he's a bit hypocritical here."

stephenking,2shv0o,levilarrington,2,Thu Jan 15 16:06:16 2015 UTC,"Very true. When I was a teenager I had a pattern:  I would read a King book and then write a short story with my own characters in a similar predicament.  I wrote a werewolf story after Cycle, a vampire story after Salem's Lot, I wrote about my male friends and classmates and I in a Long Walk, etc."
stephenking,2shv0o,GaijinSama,2,Thu Jan 15 21:34:26 2015 UTC,I didn't know that. Strange since he loves his homages.
stephenking,2shv0o,levilarrington,6,Thu Jan 15 22:46:11 2015 UTC,"I know this'll be wildly unpopular, but I do not think that IT is King's masterpiece. It's not a terrible book; I think that it has some very well-done and frightening moments. However, it's too long and I believe that parts of it could have been cut (like the sewer gang-bang).  I also felt that 11/22/63 was another long book. It felt like King had this great premise, but then spent huge chunks of the book describing life in a small town in Texas and how nice it was. There were big sections where it felt very boring to me.  I also think that The Green Mile, while well-written, is just derivative of ""To Kill a Mockingbird* and Of Mice and Men. It's not his best, but not his worst either.  I like Stephen King. I've read almost everything he's ever written, and I'll continue to do so until he puts down the pen (or until it's pried from his cold, dead fingers). I don't, however, think that he's a genius. He's talented, he works hard, he does lots of research, he has given a lot to the horror genre - but he is not a genius."

Everything relies on what perspective you have- these people were all friends, very emotionally intimate and almost all died together. In that context, it seems more reasonable.   If anything it shows emotionally maturity on Beverly's part- her father always called her a slut and a whore and that was her emotional vulnerability. She instead disregarded his abuse and bullying and made her own choice."

I saw that before I started reading King, and it actually helped when reading the Stand.  Don't get me wrong, the series is pretty bad, but there's still a lot of good parts, and for me at least knowing what was going to happen made me want to get to those parts I liked and see how they were written, what parts and details were left out, that sort of thing.

stephenking,2shv0o,SpookyGeek,2,Thu Jan 15 18:33:29 2015 UTC,"I don't like his characters and dialogue, but I love his ideas. So, I stick to his short stories now a days. I reread Dark Tower and it used to be my favorite books. I couldn't finish. The whole cheesey Ka and Ka Tet and the dog...and the face of your father...and sai this and that and .... terrible. Also, I laughed through the movie version of Green Mile. I might just be a huge cynic. But I still like his short stories because he doesn't get time to mess them up."
stephenking,2shv0o,Mrslinger85,2,Thu Jan 15 19:29:17 2015 UTC,"His dialogue is pretty rough. I feel like it works OK on the page, because he writes dialogue idiosyncratically in a way that is memorable and flashy. People use out-of-date slang or made up sayings, and when I read it it's fine. The problem is when people make movies based on his books, they really need to throw all the dialogue out. When you have to hear people saying those things, it's immediately offputting and laughable."

stephenking,2sg114,bigblackhotdog,5,Wed Jan 14 21:37:16 2015 UTC,"Re: Question 1. In IT's lair, King explains that the spider isn't a form that IT chose to be shown to them (like the clown, werewolf, etc). It's just the closest that the human mind can come to the horror that IT really is. The form in the deadlights is what IT truly is.  I'm not sure if there is an official consensus on Belch, George, etc but my opinion is that Belch is actually Belch's body being used as a sort of puppet, while Georgie (in the tunnel) is IT taking on George's form in order to get at Bill. The main reason I think Belch is actually Belch is that he's all rotting, and Pennywise is communicating to Henry in other ways as opposed to talking to him in person. (He gets that note in the glovebox.) Belch is basically just a limo driver rather than an incarnation of IT.  I don't personally think that the Losers can be considered gunslingers in the way that the Ka-tet with Roland etc is. I think this is mostly because King wasn't making connections between his worlds in that way when he wrote IT. I suppose you could argue that they are, but I don't think they were intentionally written in that way."
stephenking,2sg114,mementomori4,4,Wed Jan 14 23:13:20 2015 UTC,"I don't mean that they ARE gunslingers, but that they have the potential (like Jack). And that's another thing I thought was interested and forgot to mention. The whole ""ka is a wheel"" idea, when that similar idea comes up often in the IT book ""we were just acting out parts"" ""this was meant to happen"" ""we felt complete once Mike had joined"" and then literally with the circle and the coke bottle."
stephenking,2sg114,mementomori4,2,Wed Jan 14 23:18:07 2015 UTC,"yeah sorry i am a big TDT fan so typically everything i discuss ends up revolving around gunslingers :P.   the wheel idea actually fits nicely with IT as well, particularly the whole recurrence of IT every 27 years or whatever it was."

I personally think that people look too hard to find connections between some things -- King tends to be pretty overt with his connections between books. Since the Losers forget everything and go on the have ""normal"" lives, both between and after their interactions with IT, I don't think they have the potential to be gunslingers."
stephenking,2sg114,_Ka_Tet_,3,Wed Jan 14 23:34:06 2015 UTC,"TDT spoiler something similar happens with moving on and 'forgetting' in TDT through the artists door - Susannah seeing Jake and Eddie.  but i digress, i am just trying to link the two based on OPs questions, i do still think Bev is a gunslinger though, or at very least has the potential - Neibolt St scene with slingshot reeks of gunslinger. and a lot of Big Bills scenes through his eye very much feels like the aesthetic of a gunslinger as described in TDT.  i'm so glad i found this sub!!  edit: don't you think that, even though POST IT they forget and go back to lead normal lives, everything during childhood and their return to Derry was them being gunslingers?"

stephenking,2sg114,jacobs0n,2,Thu Jan 15 02:29:21 2015 UTC,"i have wondered about these questions, and i'll throw my 0.02 in to the best of my ability:  1  i think that IT is physically 'there' when it's Pennywise - you'll recall that most or all of those appearances are near drain pipes: neibolt street (basement, toilet), canal (seweage pipe), under the bridge (Hanscom see's IT after spending the arvo with the female teacher). the main contradiction to this is in the Library when they come back (Hanscom) but there's probably a basin or sink up there that IT came from.  i think IT can only manifest outside of the sewer for short periods of time or within a limited distance from the point which IT emanates.  either way, the reality is the same - the manifestations can harm if IT touches you/you go too close.  /u/mementomori4 mentions the vision of what the human mind can only contemplate, and IT being shown in its true form in the deadlights too.  2  i think all the bodies are still down there and IT can inhabit/animate them at IT's will. we all float  3  Bev is almost certainly a gunslinger (although not technically defined), and if you don't believe that yet then you will believe it after reading more TDT. the descriptions of feeling are almost 100% the same as in TDT, too much so to be coincidence. i believe the neibolt street scene and the training scene in (i think) TDT:3 where Susannah and them are all being trained by Roland overlap perfectly.  then if Bev is a conventional gunslinger, then the other are slingers in their own right (wordslingers: richie, bill) and i would certainly say that they are ka-tet, their power is greatest together which is the crux of the ka-tet idea.  4  i haven't seen the movie because 99% of King adaptations are genuinely disappointing and upsetting to me.  movie  i presume you're referring to Cary Fukunaga being named as director for a new adaptation of IT? or are you just doing a dream-cast set up like the TDT one? either way i like your choices!"
stephenking,2sg114,jacobs0n,2,Thu Jan 15 00:06:58 2015 UTC,"I 100% agree on your interpretation of bev and the testing at the dump. And then whenever she shoots and ""sees it with her mind"" not her eye I was convinced. And yes for the Cary pic, thanks."
stephenking,2sg114,TheFullMonty1394,0,Thu Jan 15 02:27:27 2015 UTC,"1) King addressed this and mentioned that the closer IT was to the sewer the stronger it was. It's not really an original thought.   2) also addressed in the book- It becomes anyone that is the most effective for instilling fear. Not necessarily just previous victims.   3) I agree, and   4) you should! Although the movie isn't as good as the book the guy who plays Pennywise does a great job- so much so I have nightmares years after seeing it when I was 14."
stephenking,2sg114,Miranda_is_amazing7,2,Sat Jan 17 07:20:24 2015 UTC,"A little outside the box, but I think they should reunite the cast of Freaks and Geeks for the It movie:  Bill: Sam Weir (John Francis Daley)  Eddie: Bill Haverchuck (Martin Starr)  Richie: Neil Schweiber (Samm Levine)  Ben: Gordon Crisp (Jerry Messing)  Bev: Cindy Sanders (Natasha Melnick)  Not sure about Mike and Stan.  Henry Bowers: James Franco  Victor: Jason Segel  Belch: Seth Rohan  Nobody really fits Pennywise. Benedict Cumberbatch is pretty creepy. He could do a great job with it.

stephenking,2sfxyp,ejuliab,5,Wed Jan 14 21:15:08 2015 UTC,"While I wouldn't begrudge anyone for not liking any particular novel, I will say that I thought this was one of king's best. Maybe it helped that I've been a huge Lovecraft fan my whole life (clearly King is, too.) ""Lovecraftian"" gets thrown around quite a bit, but Revival is exactly that. Jacobs a man pushing too hard to find answers he does not deserve to have; a faithless man punished for his curiosity by finding out the exact and horrifying nature of the universe.  Lovecraft frequently wrote from the perspective of the insane scholar's assistant, and Jamie was just that and he was fleshed out in the way onLy King can.  I haven't really enjoyed a King book since The wind in the keyhole. This one blew me away."
stephenking,2sfxyp,Fiftythekid,4,Thu Jan 15 22:35:04 2015 UTC,What King books have you read and loved? Maybe I can try to determine why you didn't like Revival from the other books of his that you've enjoyed.
stephenking,2sfxyp,Heisenberg82,2,Wed Jan 14 23:59:15 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed: Misery, Christine, Cujo, desperation, doctor sleep, dolares Claiborne, the eyes of the dragon, Gerald's game, green mile, it, joyland, mr, Mercedes, pet semetary, the shining, rose madder....   Honestly that is why I am so surprised with Revival because I truly love all of his work except the dark tower series, I even love his short stories.  I just really felt like this one was lacking, what was it that you liked about it?"
stephenking,2sfxyp,Heisenberg82,3,Thu Jan 15 01:02:07 2015 UTC,"Maybe you didn't find it scary enough. I enjoyed Revival but I definitely expected it to be scarier (yes, the concept behind the ending is psychologically terrifying, but I expected more).   You seem to have enjoyed a diverse scope of King books, not JUST the hardcore scary ones. So, I guess at this point you just have to roll with the fact that you disliked Revival. Can't like em all, right? You don't need to search for reasons behind why you disliked the book......if you can't think of any reasons, maybe it just rubbed you the wrong way.   As to DT, I find it to be one of the most amazing things I've ever read. The lesson behind the ending blows me away ever time I think back on it (which is quite often). Plus, it's essentially the axis upon which King's universe of books revolves; everything returns to DT. The first King books I read were The Stand and then DT, and I've been rolling through them ever since. It's nice to have read DT before everything else, because now I understand all of the small references that I otherwise would've missed. Which is why I say: read DT first, before anything else. Then enjoy the rest."

stephenking,2sfxyp,cicadajones,4,Sun Jan 18 14:20:13 2015 UTC,"I feel like Revival was originally a 75-100 page novella/short story his publishers convinced him to expand into a full-length (although it was still fairly short by King standards) novel.  I dunno, it was still and effective story but there were so many story threads that ultimately felt superfluous. You can still effectively build character in a short story (see Dolan's Cadillac, one of my favorite things he's ever written).  Ultimately it felt like a good 80% of what I read in the novel wasn't in service to the ""real"" story of Jamie and Charlie."
stephenking,2sfxyp,visibleblivet,6,Thu Jan 15 23:57:25 2015 UTC,Maybe you weren't into Revival because you had a hard time with the Dark Tower series? They are quite related.
stephenking,2sfxyp,cicadajones,4,Thu Jan 15 00:10:47 2015 UTC,I'm of the opinion that all his books are related to some degree but the Dark Tower series never came to mind while I was reading Revival. What did I miss? Were there some specific things you noticed?
stephenking,2sfxyp,MediaLoaf,2,Thu Jan 15 01:43:57 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the long pause in reply! Perhaps I should rephrase my original post, since I haven't read the entire Dark Tower series (I'm currently making my way through The Waste Lands) - the two books had some correlations that stuck out to me. Some examples: the number 19 on the car, the band names (""Gunslingers"" and ""Chrome Roses""), descriptions of electricity (although this is a reach), the idea of Jamie and Rev. Jacobs being intertwined by fate, Jamie being the ""key"" to the door that leads into another ""world"" (the projection of afterlife), the mention that the ants serve the Great Ones. I can't think of anything else off the top of my head without the book present, but there could be more! Maybe someone else can add to it."
stephenking,2sfxyp,GaijinSama,2,Fri Jan 23 20:21:17 2015 UTC,"Jamie's dad also told him to make the sign of the evil eye at crows. A definite reference to Randall Flagg.  There was direct references to Joyland as well, which was closely connected to DT."
stephenking,2sfxyp,DOLO_F_PHD,3,Wed Jan 28 04:40:15 2015 UTC,"I've said this already in this sub, but I'll expand a bit so it isn't just repeating myself.  I, like you(and most others here) grew up on Stephen King. I read It in the 6th grade. I don't think being exposed to Mr. King at a young age is all that rare, I think most of us here share that. I say this to explain that I love Stephen King so much, that I'm content to just read a few hundred pages of his prose. Even the books of his I don't care for too much I still enjoyed reading. And so, in that regard, I was not disappointed by Revival. From a storytelling standpoint, however, it was a pretty big letdown.  I think it's an interesting idea to tell the decades long story of this crazy Victor Frankenstein character through the point of view of a side character, and I loved King's take on the Cthulhu mythos, but I think his choice of narrator was a bit odd. Or, if not his choice of narrator, at least the narrator's choice of what to write about.  He wrote this book to explain his connection to this crazy mad scientist, and then the made scientist is absent for most of the book. It makes sense, because the mad scientist wasn't in his life for that long, but it's weird that this guy would choose to write a book about crazy elder gods, and then spend a hundred or so pages talking about his life as a studio musician.  Does that make sense? I just didn't find it believable that this narrator would gloss over the death of his siblings and mother, barely mention the motorcycle accident that led to his painkiller addiction. These are huge events in his life that he doesn't seem that affected by. And then he spends as much time mentioning the death of his father as he does the fact that he fell asleep in the theater during Heathers.   The writing was fine, and the scary parts were pretty scary. It's just the things that were being written about between scary bits were a bit confounding to me."
stephenking,2sfxyp,GaijinSama,3,Thu Jan 15 03:25:44 2015 UTC,"I just finished revival  And I have similar  thoughts as you. I'm a pretty decent  king fan started in like 6the grade with langoliers and secret garden secret window the shining and  the gunslinger being my first reads of him.   With that said im huge tower fan and qhile revival  was a cool story (reminded me of something along the lines of david cooperfield) and overall something you would expect from Sai king and the Lovecraft ending was well done. it seemed kinda disjointed to me since the rest of the book is pretty solidly grounded in reality and focused on jamies life it's hard to make the jump at ending to mythos town. Since there is so little forshadowing of it. (Or if there is I missed it, which is pretty possible)  granted I wouldn't be too suprised if later on Jamie shows up in like a later book or if this is  the start to like a king mythos cycle."
stephenking,2sfxyp,deviger,1 point,Thu Jan 15 19:43:06 2015 UTC,"that's actually a really good point that I forgot about. Not only is the reveal of elder gods out of left field(although he does start to introduce it early on when Jamie keeps mentioning the feeling of some guiding force behind the secret electricity), but the writing style completely changes. For the majority of the book it's in Stephen King's down-home naturalism, full of folksy curse words and slang-filled nostalgia. And then in the final 20 pages it's written in the style of HP Lovecraft, with weird arcane words(cyclopean!) and madness induced run on sentences."

Aragorn embodies pure morality, honor, duty, righteousness and he's driven by a destiny that would have him establish the reign of free men in Middle Earth.  Roland, while not an evil man, is certainly selfish and utterly driven in his pursuit of unattainable revenge.  He is perpetually pushed and pulled by anger, misery and pain. While Roland does carry the last vestiges of honor and duty, it's in a dying world that's need for honor and duty is ephemeral and his response is either seemingly out of old habit/muscle memory or in his own interests.  I wasn't implying that Roland and Aragorn are nemeses. They exist at the opposite extremes of protagonism."

Jake Chambers = I don't know, but not this kid!  Sorry, he just doesn't match up in my head.. It's just me.."
stephenking,2sbojl,Reinmaker,1 point,Tue Jan 13 22:47:16 2015 UTC,"I also considered Ryan Reynolds, but figured he was too old by now (Eddie is supposed to be early 20s). Sean William Scott was my pick a few years ago, but same issue with him, he's a bit too old now.   Technically, this guy (EDIT: my pick for Jake) is too old as well (he's 24), but looks young enough, and I think it's important to have an actor who's not going to grow out of the part as shooting goes on (like Walt on LOST). I also couldn't really think of any child actors that might fit... maybe the kid from Ender's Game?"

It was a recommendation by Stephen King back in the 80s that got me reading Leonard in the first place and I have never looked back.  Another writer in the crime genre that you might like is Carl Hiaasen.  His books combine  crime and humour in really engaging ways.  If you want a truly entertaining comedic novel to read, then my highest recommendation would be Mailman by J Robert Lennon.  Very funny, touching and imaginative.  On the horror side, Peter Straub, who has co-written with King, is an excellent writer.  But if you have been reading writers compared to King you may have gone to him already.  I could give many other recommendations, but this is a good start. King is one of my favorite writers of all time, but there are many many other wonderful talented people out there."

stephenking,2sa1r6,TexacoSaves,6,Tue Jan 13 16:17:31 2015 UTC,In The Dark Tower Barlow is identified as one of the Grandfathers and obviously (Callahans cross) belief is what can repel him. When Callahan lost his faith the cross became powerless. When Barlow entered the house there were the parents (master of the house) having no faith or belief so the rules didn't apply
stephenking,2sa1r6,Damien__,2,Tue Jan 13 16:46:50 2015 UTC,I dont think the cross requiring faith to work properly applies to every single aspect of the vampire lore.
stephenking,2sa1r6,danny17402,1 point,Tue Jan 13 22:19:32 2015 UTC,but my point was that faith/belief (not necessarily in the christian god) is what has power over The Grandfathers. If you believe your particular talisman has more power than Barlow then it will.
stephenking,2sa1r6,Damien__,2,Tue Jan 13 22:31:11 2015 UTC,As speculation I suppose that's all well and good but where's the evidence for this in the text?
stephenking,2sa1r6,danny17402,1 point,Tue Jan 13 22:35:32 2015 UTC,There isn't of course. Being fiction and entertainment the reader is suppose to make his own inferences  So many people demand evidence from a fiction... In the Dark Tower Roland is only described as taking a leak once (that I remember) must we then assume it is the only time he ever peed?
stephenking,2sa1r6,Damien__,3,Tue Jan 13 23:05:56 2015 UTC,"When were talking about Stephen King's lore, evidence from the text is absolutely important. Textual evidence is the only thing we have to go on when discussing a fictional universe. You're right when you say that inferences must be made. Your example about Roland peeing is a good example. That sort of thing can be taken on common sense, because there's nothing in the text that would lead anyone to believe that Roland's waste disposal system is any different than a normal human's.   When you venture into vampire territory however, there most certainly is evidence that shows they do not abide by the same laws that govern ordinary human action and reaction. So, the only thing we have to go on when discussing the capabilities of a vampire in the King universe is what he says in his books. The only things we can know for certain are things for which we can find explicit evidence.   Like I've already said, speculation is another story. It's fun to come up with your own story to fill in the gaps in the narrative. After all, King can't spell out every single aspect of his creations line by line.   It's only when you start stating things in such a matter of fact way, like you did in your original comment, that you need to start providing evidence from the text. It could be that belief has the sort of power over vampires that you say it does, or it could be something entirely different altogether. Without evidence from the text we just don't know for sure. That's all I'm saying."
stephenking,2sa1r6,danny17402,1 point,Tue Jan 13 23:25:33 2015 UTC,"Might just be the way I speak/type. I never meant to imply I had any special knowledge of King or the fiction he creates.  When someone asks a question that isn't answered in the text, the best the rest of us can do is guess based on Kings body of work and other works in the genre. Or ignore people's question. I chose not to ignore the questions.  Barlow/The Grandfathers may not even be vampires though they certainly share some of the same attributes. Barlow was stated as being one of the Grandfathers(DT). Since they are supposed to be hideously ugly and yet appear beautiful to their victims (Salem's Lot, Night Flyer, DT) they can apparently cloud the mind with illusions/hallucinations. But there is nothing that I remember in the text about the Grandfathers that would indicate they are bound by the rules of vampire lore. Not even Kings lore in Salems Lot because all that lore is provided by the characters from human sources and about traditional vampires on Salem's Lot's level of the Tower.  Here is a mind bender... Maybe Barlow is only bound by rules on the same level of the Dark Tower on which he was created. If he was on his level that levels rules apply, if he changes levels all bets are off. So any vampire made in the Lot would be bound by the rules of the Lot's level. Then type II and type III vampires have to follow the rules but Barlow does not. That would explain a thing or two.. (just an exploratory train of thought...)"

This could also be read aloud from a teacher's master copy.  From what I remember (and I'm going to grab my copy an check later), the rape is implied.  Bobby witnesses it as like a dream sequence where she runs down the hall and the boss and some other men chase her.  I think he witnesses the chase, and where she trips and they catch her, and then she comes home beaten.  I don't think he sees what happens in between.  EDIT: Hearts in Atlantis is pages 326-525 of a 672 page book.  Purchasing a copy of the entire book for every student may cost more than getting permission and paying to have it printed and coil-bound like a university English program would do.  EDIT 2: SPOILERS AHEAD The ""rape"" dream happens first on page 136, in section VI.  [Spoiler] It's one paragraph where the children from 'Lord of the Flies' are naked and chasing his mother along with the men on the business trip (who are still clothed).  They chant things from 'Lord of the Flies' about killing the pig, slitting her throat etc... His mother's dress is torn, but she is not beaten yet.  The longer ""rape"" dream is in section VIII (page 202-206 in my copy).  The boys from Lord of the Flies are replaced with the bullies from the Catholic school.  They're all naked this time, and King focuses a little on their penises.  Her clothing is ripped and she has been beaten. They yell at her some more, and they use word 'cunt'.  The closest they get to talking about rape is as follows : 'The back of her dress had been torn away, and Bobby could see her bare bum - her underpants were gone.  Worse, the backs of her thighs were splashed with blood.  What had they done to her?  Dear God, what had they done to his mother? ... Mr. Biderman's prick was huge ... and Bobby thought he understood the blood on his mother's legs.  He didn't want to but he thought he did.'"

Also, a public school is alot different than a university. I've never heard of a school photocoping a 200 page book for 1 student's use. That would be too expensive."
stephenking,2s7sc2,handawanda,1 point,Tue Jan 13 17:25:50 2015 UTC,"Wow, did I totally miss that? It was pretty ambiguous right? I never interpreted it as rape -- I guess I just thought Bobby's mom was crying from a combination of circumstances -- a boss that wants to be a little more than a boss, being a single mother who can barely support her child, grieving from the loss of her husband, etc etc."
stephenking,2s7sc2,handawanda,1 point,Tue Jan 13 03:40:06 2015 UTC,"Also, I thought the main point of that part was just to illustrate how confusing adult issues and emotions can be to a child -- the mother was overcome by a combination of emotions that Bobby couldn't possibly comprehend"
stephenking,2s7sc2,paras840,1 point,Tue Jan 13 03:43:23 2015 UTC,"I don't remember it exactly, but it's pretty much made clear that rape was involved. Maybe read it again and judge for yourself before you assign it."
stephenking,2s7sc2,amoryamory,1 point,Tue Jan 13 10:43:40 2015 UTC,"It's definitely rape, and I think it's multiple men. However, I don't think that's inappropriate for the age group of 17 year olds. Lots of classic school books are as bad - To Kill a Mockingbird is about a rape case, after all."
stephenking,2s7sc2,handawanda,1 point,Tue Jan 13 14:21:02 2015 UTC,"Ok, I just re-read some of the relevant passages. We only get scattered bits of information, but yeah, it's rape -- there's a lot of ambiguity about the circumstances of the affair. Sounds like maybe Liz (mom) started willingly having an affair with her boss, then he proved to be a prick and pressured her to do more and more stuff she didn't want to do, but did anyway to keep her job. When she leaves with her boss and the two other men for the conference in Providence, it's implied that she's not sure what she's in for -- maybe it's really a conference, maybe it's something bad. But then Bobby has vivid dreams of her being chased around Lord of the Flies style, and then in real life she returns home with two black eyes and a broken nose. She catches Ted trying to help heal an injured Carol, and misinterprets it as Ted molesting Carol. Liz then goes on a rant to Carol about how all men are pricks, accusing Ted of making Bobby stand by and watch as if that's what happened to Liz, etc etc. So yeah, sounds like complicated circumstances, but definitely culminated in rape. Lots of sadness in that book.   Just to clarify, this is all in Low Men in Yellow Coats."
stephenking,2s7sc2,CrimsonKing21,0,Tue Jan 13 15:14:41 2015 UTC,"The actual short story itself isn't that inappropriate at all besides language, and the only Reference to ""Low Men in Yellow Coats"" is about Bobby (her 1st love) and SJ (her 1st boyfriend).

stephenking,2s4h81,Sothotheroth,5,Mon Jan 12 17:39:49 2015 UTC,"I know they won't do this but...  I'd like to see a version of IT in which the supernatural nature of Pennywise is ambiguous. That way you're never quite sure whether Pennywise is just a serial killing clown living in the sewers or really a spectre with a malicious intent.  It could be easily done by showing that the kids in the Loser's Club are letting their fears get the best of them, and since Pennywise only attacks kids then the stories of him spread through the school and were exaggerated.   The adults never take the kids seriously not because they can't see Pennywise, but because they don't believe the kids when they tell them there is a killer clown in the sewers. The stories are too outrageous and exaggerated.  Then when the Loser's Club returns to Derry as adults their imaginations get the best of them despite their efforts to remain logical because they believed they killed Pennywise when they were kids, yet again there are kids disappearing in the town and Pennywise seems to be back."
stephenking,2s4h81,KicksButtson,9,Mon Jan 12 03:19:44 2015 UTC,and since Pennywise only attacks kids   This is not true. The very first killing in the book is an adult. (Adrian Mellon) Somewhere in the book it says PW likes kids better because they have a better imagination and taste better. But PW kills adults too. PW killed Bev's husband Tom and would have killed Audra had the losers not showed up in time. PW killed Eddie. All adults....  There is one place where the kids find a water company employee dead though they aren't sure if PW killed him or he just got lost and died.
stephenking,2s4h81,Damien__,2,Mon Jan 12 15:15:48 2015 UTC,"I'm saying in this version of the story he would only attack kids.  In my mind (and in this hypothetical version) Pennywise is actually a crazy hobo in a clown costume who lives in the Derry sewers and attacks young kids because they're easy prey. He uses the clown costume as a way to get kids to trust him and drop their guard before he lunges at them and pulls them down into the storm drains. Once in the sewers he rapes, tortures, murders, and eats them. He's like John Wayne Gacy on steroids.  The trick is that the story is told through the eyes of the kids in the Loser's Club, and in the beginning they're middle school aged kids who are highly impressionable. They're a little older than Pennywise likes to prey upon, but they go after him rather than the other way around.  Although the local police don't believe the claims, the stories of the killer clown in the sewers spread through the schools of Derry and pretty soon even the high school aged kids are feeling a little uneasy and don't dare walk through the streets alone. The kids in the Loser's Club are old enough not to be Pennywise's targets, yet they're still young enough to let the stories of Pennywise play tricks on their imaginations.  Pennywise may be a real flesh and blood man but the Loser's Club kids don't realize that, they have very active imaginations and trick themselves into believing that Pennywise is a supernatural entity. The stories from the younger kids about what they've witnessed and the fact that the adults don't believe the claims of a killer clown work to feed their imaginations. That's why they decide to go after him on their own armed with superstitious armor and weapons. It's sheer luck that they defeat him and escape with their lives.  By this point the audience realizes that Pennywise isn't supernatural and that the kids have gotten by on luck alone. But then the story fast-forwards thirty years and it seems as though Pennywise is back. Kids are disappearing again, bodies being found mutilated and eaten. Mike recalls all the remaining members of the Loser's Club to Derry.  Now as middle aged adults the members of the Loser's Club have convinced themselves that their battle with Pennywise never actually occurred, or that it was actually just a crazy hobo in the sewers and they got lucky. But they were so sure they killed him, they were so careful about making sure he didn't come back. So many years passed and no sign of him, so how could he be back now unless Pennywise really is supernatural.  Now we have grown adults trying desperately to cope with their fears as the sudden realization that their childhood trauma was real sinks in. They battle with their sanity in an attempt to rationalize what they're witnessing with what they believed as kids. Grown men and women trying to hold onto logical thought while slowly slipping back into old childhood superstitions when they realize Pennywise isn't dead, that he's come back, and maybe this means the fabric of their reality isn't made of what they thought it was.  They return to the sewers to do battle with Pennywise once again armed with their superstitions like they were kids again. What they find is an old injured hobo in a dirty clown costume living in the sewers and feeding off toddlers. Whether or not that is more or less frightening than a supernatural entity is up to the audience. But one thing is certain, Pennywise has held a grudge all these years against the kids who wounded him and left him to die in the sewers all those years ago. And now they're back."

stephenking,2rvy0m,amadiro_1,1 point,Sat Jan 10 22:11:05 2015 UTC,Agreed. It jumped into my top five SK books immediately.
stephenking,2rvy0m,randomlygen,31,Sat Jan 10 18:09:03 2015 UTC,"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon always flies under the radar but it's a near-perfect gem.  Also Danse Macabre has some great stuff in it, even if King focuses a bit too much on just a couple novels and movies he loves."
stephenking,2rvy0m,china-pimiento,11,Fri Jan 9 20:14:28 2015 UTC,"Danse Macabre is a really fun read, especially for horror junkies."
stephenking,2rvy0m,tattooedjenny,2,Fri Jan 9 20:43:13 2015 UTC,"Without it I probably never would have discovered ""X: The Man with the X-Ray Eyes"", which is a creepily effective flick despite its Roger Corman campiness."
stephenking,2rvy0m,china-pimiento,5,Fri Jan 9 22:16:07 2015 UTC,Agreed. The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon was my 1st King read and one of my favorites.  I also am a huge fan of The Eyes of the Dragon.
stephenking,2rvy0m,pixiedark,8,Fri Jan 9 20:23:03 2015 UTC,"I forgot Eyes of the Dragon! I love that one too. I especially like how King wrote it for his 12 year old daughter, and then on the very first page he talks about how King Roland can't get a hard-on."

stephenking,2rvy0m,Up_The_Butt_Jesus,1 point,Fri Jan 9 21:28:31 2015 UTC,One of my absolute favorites.  Once I finish rereading the Lovecraft I have started I am going to have to go back and read Needful Things again.

stephenking,2rvy0m,Darthac,6,Fri Jan 9 22:01:32 2015 UTC,This is what I came here to add. The opening scene disturbed me to the point I felt physically ill reading it. Such amazing writing that I rarely see mentioned in discussions about Sai King.
stephenking,2rvy0m,MsWordNerd,15,Sat Jan 10 01:33:04 2015 UTC,I quite enjoyed From a Buick 8.

stephenking,2rvy0m,aikodude,3,Sat Jan 10 05:22:39 2015 UTC,The Long Walk is actually my 2nd favorite King Book (my Fave Bachman book) but i agree i deserves much more recognition. Both this and The Running Man predate Reality TV by a number of years yet almost hit on the nose the style of culture we've become (Plus I feel like Books like The Maze Runner and The Hunger Games owe a lot to these two)
stephenking,2rvy0m,Randalflagg618,3,Sat Jan 10 11:57:31 2015 UTC,Nothing has ever bummed me out like that story did. So powerful.

Plus it makes sense King would think it was closest to himself, a book about a former drug/alcohol addled writer who enters another world (a lot like the tower for king) and his widow. Hits a little close to home lol."
stephenking,2rvy0m,4verticals,12,Sat Jan 10 06:46:42 2015 UTC,"Everyone says Christine sucked but it was the book that got me hooked on King. The premise is just so King and is so... American. High school nerd buys piece-of-crap car and renovates it in order to elevate himself in opinion of female classmates, but car is possessed by dead bastard previous owner and turns nerd into bastard! Love the rock 'n' roll lyrics at the beginning of each chapter too."
stephenking,2rvy0m,Hellspark08,1 point,Sat Jan 10 11:44:44 2015 UTC,"I just finished the audiobook at work tonight. When it occurred to me that I was listening to a story about a possessed car, I had an ""Oh you"" moment for Mr. King. At a glance, it seems like such a silly idea, but hooooly shit. He really knows what to do with a wacky idea like that.  One small correction for your summary: Arnie's motivations for buying the car were purely to fix it (her?) up and cruise. I think Leigh Cabot was purely incidental. Christine was just like Sauron's ring in a way."

stephenking,2rvy0m,fcdftw,9,Sat Jan 17 02:25:24 2015 UTC,The Cycle of The Werewolf and Everything's Eventual are two favorites that I rarely see/hear mentioned. I like the formatting of The Cycle of The Werewolf and the stories in Everything's Eventual creep me out hard.

stephenking,2rvy0m,Sanlear,2,Fri Jan 9 23:01:38 2015 UTC,Absolutely.  I'd love to read a longer version or sequel.

I loved it though. I'm a sucker for any time King goes sci-fi, first of all. I really liked the long chapters about the different townspeople and how they responded to the alien takeover. Even the goofy stuff like the coke machine, I felt like it was presented as goofy but also with an element of horror at what it would be like to actually witness something that absurd. Sometimes I feel like I'm by myself in my enjoyment of this book but I love it."

That being said, of the twenty or so that I have read, it seems that The Regulators gets dissed too much. I agree that book is totally crazy, but I remember thinking it was actually the better of the two, (with Desperation.) Of course, I read it when it was released and I was 16, so perhaps a re-read would change my opinion.   Anyway, glad to have found this group!"

stephenking,2rr76h,guy-le-doosh,6,Fri Jan 9 09:50:32 2015 UTC,I liked it up until the ending. I preferred how the story ended with a glimmer of hope. The movie is so damn downbeat! Killing everyone except himself minutes before they're saved! WTF.
stephenking,2rr76h,deviger,8,Thu Jan 8 16:44:10 2015 UTC,"I can appreciate the desire for hope -- particularly in a King story. I can't recall any of his major works that didn't have a degree of optimism. Of course, there is also the degree of pessimism to them as well. His stories almost always fit into the ""Ka is a wheel"" sentiment -- none more obviously than The Dark Tower.  But the movie version of The Mist was the perfect, heartbreaking end for that telling of the story. It needed some form of resolution -- as film and television often do -- and King's version leaves us without that. For King, it does not matter how the story concludes because real stories don't end. They just stop at some point and the best you can hope for is that you were a worthwhile person, that you were a human being and not a beast. This, in a completely unrelated note, is why I argue that Stephen King and H.P. Lovecraft are not as closely linked as people often think they are."

stephenking,2rr76h,c_is_for_cookie1983,2,Fri Jan 9 13:55:53 2015 UTC,"Great movie - it looked just like I imagined it in my own personal Skull Theater when I was reading ""Skeleton Crew""... but that ending... .  It was a good ending. A nice little sneaky, shocking gut-punch of a twist that was.... well, it was okay. It wasn't M.Night Shyamalan bad, but it didn't feel like it went with the movie. It was like an addition to the story just for the sake of having a shocker of an ending.   I much prefer the orginal novella's open-ending, which was far more unsettling than the movie's ending. The novella had them, -- well, I don't know how to do the spoiler tag, so suffice to say the novella had them in a spot where they were still alive but in a state of uncertainty with the slightest flicker of hope. You don't know what happened, or what the Mist is, or how it wraps up, if at all. That scared the crap out of me when I first read this as a kid. That not knowing, that idea that this horrible thing has happened and guess what, there's no resolution and maybe they make it out but probably they don't.   I think that's the ending the movie deserved because it really was one of my favorite King adaptations and I just wish it could have had that up in the air ending. It's haunting and psychologically unsettling because things aren't wrapped up neatly for you. The shock and awe of the movie's ending is good. But I personally think it could have been much scarier with a little subtlety."

I can say without a doubt that i have job satisfaction with being able to listen to books whilst i work the night shifts. The only downside is that if the roads arent going as smooth as you prefer then you'll find you may miss 10 or 20 seconds whilst your focus is switched fully onto the road. Some of these readers are bloody fantastic too, it might be worth listening to IT even if you've already read the book just for the narrator alone. That said i cant really relate a dark tower reading experince to my listening one, ive only read the audio versions"

stephenking,2rsgy6,Deweyrob2,5,Thu Jan 8 23:50:02 2015 UTC,Literally just finished the Drawing of the Three.  I'm just astonished at how intense it got at parts. Never has a book got me so on edge...  Some say I should read the Stand before continuing though...
stephenking,2rsgy6,Deweyrob2,3,Thu Jan 8 23:52:02 2015 UTC,"I would agree with that. Not completely necessary, but worth it, imo. I would also read Salem's Lot before book five. That one is almost a must. Then Insomnia and It before book 7. Gotta have The Talisman and Black House in there somewhere, probably before book 6. That's a helluva list, but it will make them much more enjoyable."
stephenking,2rsgy6,housethatjacobbuilt,2,Fri Jan 9 03:18:01 2015 UTC,Thank you :D I will be sure to take that advice.  Literally just got back from the library with The Stand.

stephenking,2rsgy6,thx316,3,Fri Jan 9 16:45:25 2015 UTC,The Dark Tower.  It's referred to as his magnum opus for a reason.    If I were to pick any one novel or piece of work on it's own instead of a series I'd go with The Stand.
stephenking,2rsgy6,TheGunslinger5,2,Fri Jan 9 17:22:21 2015 UTC,"This seems to be the general consensus.  Luckily, I just finished The Drawing of the Three and have literally just got home from the Library with the Stand."
stephenking,2rsgy6,coco12291,3,Fri Jan 9 17:28:01 2015 UTC,This is by no means going to be a popular opinion but my favorite book of King's as well as my favorite book period is The Gunslinger. I know people have shown enthusiasm for the Tower series but in my experience for whatever reason most people still hate the first book.  It's been 10 minutes and I still don't even know where to begin describing how those books make me feel. Suffice it to say that I felt them on an almost spiritual level.

stephenking,2rsgy6,housethatjacobbuilt,2,Fri Jan 9 00:38:22 2015 UTC,Pet Sematary. But Lisey's Story and It are both incredible as well.
stephenking,2rsgy6,Texas_Rangers,2,Fri Jan 9 02:06:30 2015 UTC,"The Stand and The Shining for me.   The Stand takes the top spot. I've read almost all his works,  but I always come back to The Stand. A timeless adventure for me.   The Shining is just a creepy, fun experience all around. A bit slow at first,  but once it gets going... wow."
stephenking,2rsgy6,icantbearsed,2,Fri Jan 9 08:49:29 2015 UTC,The Dead Zone is my absolute personal favorite. I'd say the Dark Tower series would qualify as a single greatest work. I'm not as into the Dark Tower though. I like some and don't like some.

stephenking,2rqnn7,bigblackhotdog,13,Thu Jan 8 13:15:31 2015 UTC,"It is an Amazing book, one of my all time favorites. I grew up in Bangor and many of the places that he depicts in it were my old stomping grounds (the stand pipe, library, Paul Bunyan) so it's super creepy to think these things happening in my town.  The part where the three youths throw the gay guy off the bridge is based on an actual event that happened in Bangor in 1984.  The man that was attacked was Charlie Howard,  SK renamed him to Adrian Mellon.  If you love the book I recommend taking a trip to Bangor in the summer and taking the Stephen King Tour.  http://www.sk-tours.com/  Another note:  This is definitely a horror book, but it's made more horrific because you get attached to the characters.  He writes children so well and I fell in love with them and I didn't want anything bad to happen to them."

I walk down Up mile hill each day to work and see Beverly's apartment daily! Pretty rad for us west coasters that haven't made the trek to Maine yet.   Edit: also the theatre where they watch I Was a Teenage Werewolf, (The Paramount, 652 Columbia St), is a strip club inside (original exterior) which makes for an interesting lap dance."

Howard (January 31, 1961 – July 7, 1984) was an American homosexual murder victim in Bangor, Maine in 1984. As Howard and a male companion, Roy Ogden, were walking down the street, three teenagers, Shawn I. Mabry, age 16, James Francis Baines, age 15, and Daniel Ness, age 17, harassed Howard for being gay. The youths chased the pair, yelling homophobic epithets, until they caught Howard and threw him over the State Street Bridge into the Kenduskeag Stream, despite his pleas that he could not swim. He drowned, but his friend escaped and pulled a fire alarm. Charlie Howard's body was found by rescue workers several hours later.

stephenking,2rqnn7,Shalamarr,3,Thu Jan 8 15:16:13 2015 UTC,Have to agree. This is one of my favorites. Fantastic character development. Great story with a haunting twist at the end.

They way everything is described makes you part of the story, every setting feels real, and familiar, even though i live in a city far from being like derry. (I'm from Monterrey, México ... mountain city, hot almost all year, not forests around).  When i read the first scares (the corcoran kid and mike henlon) i thought they were kinda lame, but after putting the book down for a while, i remembered they were living the 50s and they were kids after all, so the things that scared them was the typical scary things of that era, maybe not scary for me, but for them was the most terrible things to battle or escape from.

Thinking about it with this question in mind, it does seem that this was written in a different style...maybe not so much a different style as maybe written ""down"" for lack of a better term?  He took some things that would typically be more complex in his later adult novels and simplified them for a younger mind perhaps.  Still a better love story than Twilight."

stephenking,2rnouo,Newton_Pulsifer,2,Wed Jan 7 23:15:35 2015 UTC,"I'm about 3/4 of the way through it. I have read it before, but not since high school. I was just thinking today how strange it's written in a neat way. What gets me is that it's a fantasy tale from a world with magic and dragons and the such, but it's being told be a narrator seemingly from a world like ours. It seems to be more or less told from King's own perspective like he's just telling a story instead of writing a novel. It's also being told in a completely omniscient manner. The storyteller makes it very clear in the beginning that he knows exactly how it ends. He also often points out how small things were going to change the entire story such as if Peter had thought of this he might have attempted his escape 2 years earlier. This was one of my favorite books when I was in high school and now I can remember why. It is told in a way very unique to King or any other author I've read. I'll finish it up tomorrow and would love to discuss it further. I'm making my way back through all his old books that I read in high school. I reread The Dark Tower then The Talisman.  The Stand is next after I finish this."

I really enjoyed him stepping away from some his more traditional ""monster style"" books and into something more existential.  My big hope after reading this is that he will do more in the same vein.  He created such an amazing introduction to this hellscape that it would be such a waste to no do more with it.  I also thing the new ""villain"" is right up there, if not better, than the Crimson King.

stephenking,2rmxrn,errindel,6,Thu Jan 15 00:46:12 2015 UTC,"Sorry you feel that way I guess.. :-/  You can't really summarize a ""point"" from a horror (especially a Stephen King) book, can you? Then it's just gonna be ""the vampire story"", ""a guy tried to revive his kid but failed"", or ""a loser got a job but blew it and tried to kill his family""... For me, I totally feel every single word he's describing and every single emotion there is... and fascinated by his wild imagination in infinite dimensions. If there was a point, of course it's just personal opinions, he sorta violently opened the most unspeakable most unknown box of death for us... And it's not as beautiful as we have been telling ourselves..."
stephenking,2rmxrn,angelocrator,1 point,Wed Jan 7 17:30:08 2015 UTC,"Haha Bed Bath and Beyond.. Yeah I see what you mean.. But weird enough that's also the interesting part. Of course we all focused super hard on what's Jacobs was up to... I did too.. But then I realized that it wasn't the point at all... If the storyline was a train, Jacobs and all the dead ones are just passengers... They don't make the story... They just live it... Helplessly..."
stephenking,2rmxrn,clwestbr,3,Wed Jan 7 17:53:25 2015 UTC,"If the storyline was a train, Jacobs and all the dead ones are just passengers... They don't make the story... They just live it... Helplessly...   That is the perfect analogy for this story!   I also really enjoyed not having any idea where the book was going until the very end.  Everytime I thought I had it figured out, King would veer wildly in a new direction."
stephenking,2rmxrn,Miranda_is_amazing7,2,Wed Jan 7 18:09:42 2015 UTC,"I agree, I didn't find it especially scary. It seemed like a short story extended to novel length. I think the punch would have been much harder if it had been delivered sooner. As it is, the tension doesn't build until the end and it's based on a fear that wasn't spoken until that point."
stephenking,2rmxrn,clwestbr,1 point,Wed Jan 7 20:06:34 2015 UTC,It doesn't deliver on the idea of the 'secret electricity' because the electricity isn't the answer to the story... It was the catalyst to achieve the 'glimpse through the keyhole' Jacobs was after. King cited the original authors of the idea. It'll take a few minutes on the web but I'm sure those authors can answer your expectation
stephenking,2rkp32,JJSweets,3,Wed Jan 7 00:38:39 2015 UTC,i liked that part

stephenking,2rkp32,Johnotronz,2,Wed Jan 7 05:18:30 2015 UTC,Recently I've been watching tons of Stephen King speaking engagements on youtube and they're really interesting to me.  A lot of the bits he uses are the same in all the different engagements but you get some cool behind the scenes info in them too.

stephenking,2rkp32,KuchDaddy,1 point,Wed Jan 7 14:15:34 2015 UTC,"Yep, crazy novel. Best book I've read in a while and half of it went over my head. Gonna have to reread it soon"
stephenking,2rizxn,Prince-Cola,5,Tue Jan 6 16:47:08 2015 UTC,"Sue thought she was pregnant. The ending is a bit ambiguous - did Carrie cause her to miscarry? If so, was that a gesture of kindness or punishment? Or did Sue's period simply show up.   The other telekinetic girl is a relative of Carrie's, so implications that it could happen again."
stephenking,2rizxn,Epona142,4,Tue Jan 6 18:35:15 2015 UTC,My interpretation has always been that she miscarried a pregnancy
stephenking,2rizxn,deviger,2,Tue Jan 6 18:50:19 2015 UTC,"That's my thought as well. I just remember reading a discussion on how it could have been multiple things, and if Carrie intended to cause her to miscarry, and why. It was interesting."
stephenking,2rizxn,Epona142,1 point,Tue Jan 6 19:05:30 2015 UTC,Remember any of the reasons people had for why Carrie may have caused her to miscarry? Now I'm curious.
stephenking,2rizxn,deviger,4,Tue Jan 6 19:11:39 2015 UTC,"Never thought about it as Carrie intending for Sue to miscarry--I saw it more like Sue being too close to the intense psychic energy Carrie was releasing and her body not being able to withstand the shock. It depends on how you see Carrie, whether you think of her as malicious or not. My interpretation was that it was an accident. Pregnancies that early along are notoriously easy to miscarry anyway, and over half of them get reabsorbed by the mother before she ever even knew she was pregnant."
stephenking,2rizxn,doryfishie,7,Tue Jan 6 23:26:32 2015 UTC,"King's early works act as a lot of ""proof of concept"" for later stuff, since his writing has a common setting. Carrie makes mention of how the genetic markers for TK come up, and the girl at the end is a clear indication that there are others with Carrie's powers. People with psychic powers are present in a lot of his stories. Sometimes it's called ""the shining"" or ""the touch"" in other stuff."
stephenking,2rizxn,domdest,5,Tue Jan 6 19:25:25 2015 UTC,"I haven't read Carrie in many years (and I really should), so the bit about Sue bleeding is beyond my memory, but certainly the implication of the girl at the end is that she's another Carrie, with the same telekinetic abilities."
stephenking,2rizxn,HugoNebula,5,Tue Jan 6 18:15:25 2015 UTC,"Sue was pregnant and it seemed that Carrie caused her to miscarry.  As with the girl moving the balls the implication is that Carrie's situation made the world aware of children with TK abilities, so they are looking at other cases.   I need to reread it. All this seemed really clear when I read it, but I might just be confusing it with the fact that I saw both the old and new film before reading it so that may have colored my vision of it."
stephenking,2rizxn,clwestbr,1 point,Tue Jan 6 22:34:41 2015 UTC,"I thought Sue just got her period. I thought it was kind of like a way of book-ending the story: in the beginning, Carrie is mocked because she gets her period, and in the end, Sue gets her period."
stephenking,2rizxn,Onefortheisland,-6,Wed Jan 7 14:41:22 2015 UTC,How old are you? It's a pretty simple book...
stephenking,2rizxn,Jota769,1 point,Wed Jan 7 13:14:08 2015 UTC,"Well considering the comments in this thread, it is clear a lot of people did interpret in different ways so it is a fine question to ask.."
stephenking,2rizxn,GrahamMc,0,Sat Jan 10 01:56:47 2015 UTC,"I really don't see how there are multiple interpretations.  Sue had her period, a mirror to Carrie's period that started the story. It's intentionally ambiguous but implied that Carrie did it, that she was never preggers in the first place, or the stress of the situation triggered a natural abortion. There's no right answer.  The ending is that there's a TK girl, meaning that the story could and would keep continuing, that this horror could happen in your town, etc."
stephenking,2rizxn,Jota769,2,Mon Jan 12 00:26:09 2015 UTC,There's no right answer.   So what's wrong with asking for interpretations?  Get off your high horse mate

stephenking,2rjw1r,Miranda_is_amazing7,9,Tue Jan 6 20:54:01 2015 UTC,"Small town life and how it shapes people into who they are.  As someone from a town of less than 1000 people, it was always great on how he captured the way life truly is in them."
stephenking,2rjw1r,TheTrueRory,7,Wed Jan 7 10:18:09 2015 UTC,"As someone who grew up in a smaller Maine town, I can also see how good he is at capturing that unique dynamic of small town life. Which brings me to another one of his themes, evil can be anywhere. It doesn't just have to be the dark gothic castle or some weird laboratory, evil can live on your street."
stephenking,2rjw1r,deviger,3,Wed Jan 7 19:04:45 2015 UTC,"That theme has definitely resonated with me too, which almost makes the whole concept more terrifying, doesn't it?"
stephenking,2rjw1r,deviger,3,Wed Jan 7 19:08:15 2015 UTC,Sometimes I'll take a drive out of town. I don't live far from the area where King grew up. I've read enough of his work that when I see a house with cracking paint or a bit too much junk strewn about I get a little spooked.
stephenking,2rjw1r,deviger,2,Wed Jan 7 19:13:42 2015 UTC,I would do the exact same thing. Hahaha  Ever since I started reading King I always get a little nervous being in the NH/ME/VT area. I'm actually surprised Derry hasn't brought legal action against King but I guess it makes them famous.
stephenking,2rjw1r,Circlecraft,2,Wed Jan 7 19:50:54 2015 UTC,"No Derry, ME. There is however a Derry, New Hampshire, which actually isn't all that far from the Maine border."
stephenking,2rjw1r,talkingwires,2,Wed Jan 7 20:08:30 2015 UTC,Oh ok right. It's a practical move that he made a sinister town from a fictional place.
stephenking,2rjw1r,deviger,3,Wed Jan 7 20:21:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, very good point. I grew up in a tiny town too (about 400 people annually) and I've always liked that Stephen King brought up that theme."
stephenking,2rjw1r,bobo_brown,6,Wed Jan 7 19:05:12 2015 UTC,Addiction is a big theme in many of his storys. Especially The Dark Tower.
stephenking,2rjw1r,deviger,5,Wed Jan 7 12:19:57 2015 UTC,"I just finished The Shining, where alcoholism plays a huge role in the story.   I also see now why King hated Kubrick's adaptation of it. About the only part of the book the film retained was the basic ""family trapped in a hotel"" plot. Hell, why'd they even call it ""The Shining"" when nobody in the film ""shines""?"
stephenking,2rjw1r,city17_dweller,1 point,Wed Jan 7 15:42:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah if someone warped my writing like Kubrick did to The Shining I would be mad too. I feel like Kubrick had his own message in that movie, which I guess in its own way makes it 'his' story, but I feel like he should have been more faithful to the storyline.   When people tell me that they love the movie I always try to direct the towards the book. It's just sooo much more intriguing."
stephenking,2rjw1r,Darthac,3,Wed Jan 7 19:11:36 2015 UTC,"Being in AA myself and knowing King is also in the program, I can see hints at that everywhere in his writing, which may or may not be intentional. Although he has said, ""write what you know."""
stephenking,2rjw1r,Darthac,3,Wed Jan 7 19:06:01 2015 UTC,"I'm sure most of it is intentional. Not sure if you've read Doctor Sleep and Revival yet, but they are absolutely abounding with references. I've been a part of AA myself, so it always amuses me to think of him in the rooms."
stephenking,2rjw1r,deviger,1 point,Wed Jan 7 19:49:27 2015 UTC,I have read Revival and I definitely saw it there. Just finished 11/22/63 and it's pretty blatant there as well.
stephenking,2rjw1r,Rawlk,5,Wed Jan 7 20:06:18 2015 UTC,"I was intrigued with his exploration of stories that didn't come with the endings neatly wrapped in a bow... From a Buick 8, The Colorado Kid (I'm sure I'm forgetting one), and of course the conclusion of the Dark Tower series kind of revisited that idea.  I like the theme you picked, too; characters like Jack Torrence or Harold Lauder are fascinating for having been corrupted by something, rather than just being blanketedly evil."
stephenking,2rjw1r,Sanlear,5,Tue Jan 6 21:37:03 2015 UTC,"I love stories that don't have a definitive conclusion- I've a serial re-reader of my favorites but I'll definitely check those out. :)  Yeah it struck me as a theme of his- Larry Underwood, for example, was haunted by the person he was and it almost crushed him, but he rose above that adversity where others fell and let their vulnerabilities dictate their lives."
stephenking,2rjw1r,levilarrington,4,Tue Jan 6 21:40:23 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I'd call it a theme, but I my favorite thing about King's works is that his characters are very real.  They're just like people you meet in real life.  They aren't superheroes or supervillains; they're normal people put in super-normal situations, and they cope the best they can."
stephenking,2rjw1r,ElwoodBlatch,4,Tue Jan 6 23:23:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, really good point. :) branching off of that point, I've always enjoyed that Stephen King makes the supernatural plausible, making it more eerie. From what I've seen most writers don't put that kind of effort in."
stephenking,2rjw1r,jimjameko,3,Tue Jan 6 23:32:26 2015 UTC,"The best part is that, not only is the supernatural plausible, but it's often unexplained.  Horror is about what you don't know; the second you start explaining what everything is, it stops being scary.  His main characters often know as much as the reader does, and I love it."
stephenking,2rjw1r,bobo_brown,3,Tue Jan 6 23:40:44 2015 UTC,That's interesting. It reminds me of George Romero. Why are the dead rising? No explanation. Maybe it is King going against the 50s scfi/horror where everything had an explanation. I'll have to reread Danse Macabre
stephenking,2rjw1r,logboy,3,Wed Jan 7 03:46:08 2015 UTC,"I agree. He does a very good job of ""humanizing"" his characters. Really diving into their ""thinking"" while scared/confused/happy etc. Or even as their rational crumbles in the face of terror."
stephenking,2rlm7a,AiCPearlJam,2,Wed Jan 7 05:28:14 2015 UTC,I got mine yesterday. I ordered it in April when it was first announced. Waiting for them to put Salem's Lot up for sale so I can get it ordered and start the wait all over again.

stephenking,2rlm7a,chillbill69,1 point,Wed Jan 7 23:58:26 2015 UTC,"no, it sold out within minutes, wouldn't be able to afford a signed one anyhow. The $85 for the gift edition was high enough."
stephenking,2rlm7a,chillbill69,1 point,Thu Jan 8 00:02:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I wanna collect all of the $85 editions. Having the complete set is enough for me. How's it look?"
stephenking,2rlm7a,chillbill69,1 point,Thu Jan 8 00:05:02 2015 UTC,"I will try to get some pictures up tomorrow. I had a rough day yesterday and still feeling the effects today.  I love it though. It's on the same level as the 25th anniversary IT and the gift edition of Dr. Sleep in my book (I'm kind of a fan, lol)"
stephenking,2rlm7a,chillbill69,2,Thu Jan 8 23:52:44 2015 UTC,"I don't think you are talking about the Cemetery Dance version of the book. There is another publisher who is doing this as well. If you did indeed pre order it I'd love to see a copy of your invoice (Cemetery Dance emailed you one, they always do)."
stephenking,2rlm7a,chillbill69,2,Fri Jan 9 14:50:03 2015 UTC,it's cool. I have to apologize. I relooked through my old emails and I got this too. I just didn't have the funds to order at the time. According to Cemetery Dance's facebook page they will have a order chance this month for those who didn't get this mail.

stephenking,2rjel9,armyjackson,10,Tue Jan 6 18:41:42 2015 UTC,"See, I really enjoyed Revival. I liked the slow pacing of the novel and the hard punches that suddenly came at quiet moments."
stephenking,2rjel9,deviger,3,Tue Jan 6 18:49:28 2015 UTC,"If by 'ridiculous' you mean kinda predictable, then yes I agree up until the conclusion.   As the ex-priest said, Jamie was the alpha and omega to him in that town, the first and the last. If anyone would have an accurate perspective of Charlie in his time of trauma, it would be Jamie.   I personally liked that Jamie was empathetic towards the ex-priest and didn't treat him with the same disgust that most others did directly following the Terrible Sermon. Likewise, Jamie's perspective of Charlie never excelled to an admiration that accompanied most of Charlie's followers from his time at the religious tent revivals.   It was beautiful in its own way that although Jamie hated Charlie for what he did to people, he also understood that Charlie held a deep fixation with electricity that was his means of coping with the trauma of suddenly losing his entire family.   Jamie knew what Charlie was doing wasn't right, but Jamie also realizes at the end that Charlie's obsession was a deep sickness that he used to try to understand the world."
stephenking,2rjel9,Miranda_is_amazing7,2,Tue Jan 6 20:49:44 2015 UTC,"Just finished the book today.  I really enjoyed their relationship as well and wish we would of seen more of it.  I enjoyed the young Reverend so much it pained me to see him become a completely different man.  I understand why he did, I just wish we could of seen the man he was more in the older version of himself."
stephenking,2rjel9,ProductionDude17,2,Mon Jan 19 04:55:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah it was tragic to see the Reverend tortured by his obsession... I think Kings message was to show exactly how warped the man became, and how if the Reverend could have forgiven the world he would have had a much happier life. But, then again, if he hadn't been fixated on it we wouldn't have had the intriguing story. :)"
stephenking,2rjel9,Miranda_is_amazing7,3,Mon Jan 19 04:59:43 2015 UTC,"The book's not long, but it only gets interesting at the end. It seems a lot of people have liked the slow pace, but I found it to be very plodding."
stephenking,2rjel9,spencerofthemoon,2,Tue Jan 6 19:23:52 2015 UTC,What do you mean by 'ridiculous'?
stephenking,2rjel9,Miranda_is_amazing7,1 point,Tue Jan 6 20:03:41 2015 UTC,"I dug the pacing and am so exhausted by the 'twist ending' that I thought the dread of the inevitable conclusion was awesome.  I'll say that just a few years ago we got Doctor Sleep, where we were introduced to a ton of characters and had many that were with us for nearly the whole book die off one at a time. We don't have to miss that, he's still doing it. He just tried something else and I thought the slowly mounting dread was far more effective than anything gut punching or any twist he could have done."
stephenking,2rjel9,clwestbr,1 point,Wed Jan 7 03:06:50 2015 UTC,"I didn't see the ending really as a twist. I expected something like that to happen as their were seeds of it all through the book. I didn't not expect the utter hopelessness, but I guess he was channeling HP Lovecraft's idea that we are all small and insignificant in the universe."
stephenking,2rjel9,deviger,1 point,Wed Jan 7 19:07:50 2015 UTC,"I didn't like it at all. It seemed to drag on and I kept waiting for something to ""happen"". It may by least favorite book by King."
stephenking,2rjel9,pixiedark,0,Fri Jan 9 01:10:55 2015 UTC,I wish I had liked it more.  I did like the left turn it took at the end that I didn't see coming.
stephenking,2rjel9,sbfaught,3,Tue Jan 6 19:51:49 2015 UTC,"It needed way more of that stuff throughout the book. It's a lot to take in at the very end. Even more references to the mother and stuff like that, instead of just constantly mentioning the 'secret electricity.'"
stephenking,2rjel9,spencerofthemoon,2,Tue Jan 6 21:58:35 2015 UTC,"I agree.  Throughout the book I kept saying, I guess they will tell me about the secret electricity in the last chapter."
stephenking,2rhts1,animal34,10,Tue Jan 6 07:46:57 2015 UTC,"The only book that's ever made me cry like a baby. By far, one of the most fantastic books I've ever read. Was my very favorite until I read The Stand, now it's a close second."
stephenking,2rhts1,The_Buffmeister,10,Tue Jan 6 14:06:41 2015 UTC,"It's definitely one of my favorites.  He did an amazing job capturing a really old narrator, and the characters were all so lovable (except Percy. Fuck Precy). I've never had a book make me cry more than once before."
stephenking,2rhts1,ayoungjacknicholson,9,Tue Jan 6 14:01:54 2015 UTC,"I have incredibly fond memories of reading that book. I was living in Minneapolis at the time, and would take each monthly installment to nearby Lake Nokomis and read it in its entirety in the afternoon. Each book took me about an hour from what I remember. The final installment was lengthier than the prior ones, so I finished that as the sun was setting and the first evening stars were appearing in the soon to be night sky. I remember thinking it was the best Stephen King book I'd read in years."
stephenking,2rhts1,inasimplerhyme,7,Tue Jan 6 15:09:24 2015 UTC,"It's a fantastic book, all about the beauty and ugliness, the triumphs and tragedies of life. The epilogue is one of the most moving conclusions to any of his books. My twelve year old heart ached for days after reading that one. ""Sometimes the mile is just so long..."""
stephenking,2rhts1,bobo_brown,3,Tue Jan 6 12:55:35 2015 UTC,"now that you mention it, i don't hear about it that often either, and now i can't figure why because it's one of my top king books. i remember liking the movie a lot too, and usually i don't care for movies in general, let alone book adaptations. i'm due for a reread of this one."
stephenking,2rhts1,420boy,3,Tue Jan 6 09:05:08 2015 UTC,I tried keeping up with it when it was released in chunks and couldn't keep interest.   I think I was too young to appreciate the story at the time.  Last year I downloaded the book on my Kindle and enjoyed it immensely.
stephenking,2rhts1,sunshine_rex,3,Tue Jan 6 11:10:41 2015 UTC,"I read it for the first time last year and I really, really liked it. I think it's a bit different to King's usual in that I wouldn't really call it a horror or crime, it is solely supernatural? It's certainly very emotional and there's incredible depth to the characters, definitely needs more recognition here!"
stephenking,2rhts1,Ki-Box,3,Tue Jan 6 12:21:04 2015 UTC,"I read it last march I think. Overall, it's probably my absolute favorite King book. It's beautifully written and very fully developed. and heartbreaking.   I love love love King's scary stuff (Salems Lot, The Shining, etc.) but this one just blew the doors off my view of him as a writer.   I'm very picky with what I rate 5 stars on Goodreads. LOTR, Jurassic Park, Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, and The Green Mile are (I think) my only 5 star books on Goodreads.   I think the reason it doesn't get brought up much is because of the narrative built around King as a Horror/Thriller writer. People want to read those books from him and get so enamoured with being terrified out of their minds that they rave about them and forget things like ""The Body"" or Shawshank, or The Green Mile.  I think another big reason might be because the movies of those stories were so fantastic that people tend to forget they were books or short stories first."
stephenking,2rhts1,JitteryPenguin,3,Tue Jan 6 15:04:01 2015 UTC,"It was a fantastic book and I can't think of a single thing wrong with it.  The Chapbook format was an interesting experiment, I liked it once but I am glad he didn't do that on a regular basis"
stephenking,2rhts1,Damien__,3,Tue Jan 6 15:19:01 2015 UTC,Question for the oldies - who remembers it being released in small parts you could buy from the News agent?
stephenking,2rhts1,I_LIKE_LIGHTS,2,Tue Jan 6 20:51:51 2015 UTC,I bought the 'chapbooks' (That's what King called them) as they came out.
stephenking,2rhts1,Damien__,2,Tue Jan 6 20:59:10 2015 UTC,"I was able to get all of the ""chapbooks"" from used bookstores and a library sale. It took me two states' worth of scrounging, but they happily adorn the collection now. I have the full softcover as well; that was the medium in which I read it the first time."
stephenking,2rhts1,ConBro8,2,Tue Jan 6 21:53:47 2015 UTC,"It was my first Stephen King book, in fourth or fifth grade. There were a few topics that I thankfully didn't understand at the time, and I had quite a few nightmares about sitting on Old Sparky myself, but it was the first fiction book I ever loved. There is so much humanity found in each of the characters that every time I reread it I felt like I was revisiting old friends. Which makes the characters of Percy and Brad doubly frustrating. While I remember my teacher taking it away from me and saying I wasn't old enough for it, The Green Mile set a high mark for empathy at an early age. If I can empathize with these men who have committed the most awful crimes imaginable, I imagine that I can with just about anyone.   I only recently saw the movie for the first time, and I was surprised by how good it was. I definitely prefer my own imagination and King's voice, but the movie does a great job of getting close. It's been a few years since I read the book, but it's ingrained enough that on a fairly regular basis, I hear whispers of Paul Edgecombe in the corners of my thoughts."
stephenking,2rhts1,1859,2,Tue Jan 6 14:28:08 2015 UTC,It left me in a dark place. I loved it.
stephenking,2rhts1,chumrunner,2,Tue Jan 6 15:14:25 2015 UTC,"The Green Mile was the first King book I ever read. I was 11 at the time, and finished it in 3 days. I was hooked on King from that moment on. I haven't read it since, but am looking forward to going back through it."
stephenking,2rhts1,ConBro8,2,Tue Jan 6 21:50:31 2015 UTC,Read it a long time ago and can't remember it vividly. Just that it was a really good book.
stephenking,2rhts1,RisingRapture,2,Wed Jan 7 00:29:51 2015 UTC,Honestly the first King book that made me break down and cry.  I read it as one novel and I could not put it down.  I go back and reread it once in a while and I still get a tightness in my throat.  Beautifully written and  one of his crowning glories in my opinion.
stephenking,2rhts1,Damascus71,1 point,Wed Jan 7 00:32:17 2015 UTC,I read it when it was first released as the serial novels (one a month). I was a freshman in college at the time.  I liked it but it's not one of my favorites of his.
stephenking,2rhts1,chillbill69,1 point,Wed Jan 7 23:59:25 2015 UTC,"I only read it back when the monthly chapters were being released. I would be interested in re-reading the version that was all combined. I'd imagine that a few things were changed, but probably not enough to notice a difference."
stephenking,2rhts1,Moses_Scurry,0,Fri Jan 9 15:14:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not a huge fan of The Green Mile. I think it's well-written, but plotwise, it's a mashup of To Kill a Mockingbird and Of Mice and Men. I think it's probably the worst (or maybe best, depending on how you look at it) example of the ""magical negro"" archetype in literature; we're introduced to a magical black man whose sole purpose in life seems to be absorbing the pain of white people. It's one of those things that just made me cringe a lot.   That being said, I do think it's extremely well-written. I don't think it's King's best work, but it's far from his worst."
stephenking,2rg8d1,Simius,11,Mon Jan 5 23:00:23 2015 UTC,"This is one of my very favorite SK books; but I love it for its sense of nostalgia and the relationships he explores. This may be one that might appeal most to Constant Readers of a certain age (or more specifically, those of the authors generation) than to younger readers who won't necessarily connect with many of his references. For me, it is one big bittersweet trip down memory lane.  Never fails to elicit tears."
stephenking,2rg8d1,CylonSpring,3,Tue Jan 6 03:07:59 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I rarely read the other stories, but Hearts in Atlantis is by far one of my favorite. It's such a great coming of age story, and I like that it doesn't have a happy ending"
stephenking,2rg8d1,Bodom101,2,Tue Jan 6 04:07:37 2015 UTC,"Always loved it. Great read.  When I go back to it a few years after i read it, it always surprises me how great it is."

stephenking,2rg8d1,ughalready,3,Tue Jan 6 14:21:30 2015 UTC,"I thought it was a decent movie.  Only followed one of the story arcs, but it was pretty good.  Anthony Hopkins did a great job."

stephenking,2rg8d1,6isNotANumber,1 point,Tue Jan 6 18:59:25 2015 UTC,I honestly really enjoyed both. As another tower junkie I was disappointed by the lack of references but I understood why they couldn't be there. Honestly the only thing I was disappointed about was the lack of yellow coats but again: can you imagine how fucking dumb that would have looked on the silver screen? People wouldn't have taken it seriously in the film medium. And to underline your point: Anthony Hopkins was perfect.

I don't do that anymore and it helped me enjoy many king adaptations that'd otherwise suck (or still do but I enjoy them for what they are)."

A lot of youthful sloppiness left the building and character advancement is on point.  (although a bit lacking in Mr. Mercedes)  I'm excited for more and will continue the journey with him.  And it's not going to stop with his own mortality, Joe Hill is just as captivating."
stephenking,2rf4tb,TheMFDrez,5,Mon Jan 5 18:44:29 2015 UTC,"I haven't read Duma Key yet, but it's on my list. I've read some of Heart Shaped Box by Joe Hill and most of 20th Century Ghosts. Hill's comic book work on Locke and Key and collaboration with his dad on Throttle and their adaptation of Duel were great."
stephenking,2rf4tb,SGT_BUTTSTICK,6,Mon Jan 5 18:54:44 2015 UTC,Horns and NOS4A2 by Joe Hill are two of my favorite books.  You can actually see how he's getting better with each novel he writes.
stephenking,2rf4tb,sartres-shart,5,Mon Jan 5 20:47:24 2015 UTC,Joe Hill is almost like reading king with something special thrown in. It's a fantastic development and very lucky for us constant readers.
stephenking,2rf4tb,SGT_BUTTSTICK,2,Mon Jan 5 21:13:20 2015 UTC,Anyone see the movie adaptation of Horns?
stephenking,2rf4tb,SynysterSaint,3,Mon Jan 5 20:52:22 2015 UTC,I've had it downloaded for a little while now but haven't gotten around to watching it.  I was worried it wouldn't live up to how much I loved the book but I've heard Hill and King both praise it so hopefully it does the novel justice
stephenking,2rf4tb,SynysterSaint,1 point,Mon Jan 5 21:00:31 2015 UTC,"Hill praised Radcliffe's performance, and that's about it. Here's, I think, one of the more telling interviews about the film. Hill's answers sound diplomatic to me. And not kind diplomatic. More ""I did what I could, but they're ultimately responsible"" diplomatic. I could be wrong, but that's my reading of his statements."
stephenking,2rf4tb,sammidavisjr,2,Tue Jan 6 05:51:23 2015 UTC,"Coincidentally, I watched it earlier tonight. I suggest you stay away from it.  Horns the film is a shallow story about one-dimensional characters with little exposition beyond ""Merrin is dead, Ig is sad, everyone hates Ig, oh wait Ig has horns now, let's find out who killed Merrin."" Brunin cut a ton of the story (the treehouse is just a generic treehouse, most of their childhood is unexplored save for two exceptionally brief segments, Lee's lack of reaction to the horns goes from mystery to explained in literally two sentences out of fucking nowhere, Ig gets his pitchfork from the warehouse then never returns there) and pointlessly rewrote character relationships (Ig and Terry are horrid to each other, Lee is Ig's attorney, Glenna is just a bar slut who's there for maybe five minutes, Eric is just some cop who has maybe three lines). Then there's the ending. Holy fuck. I won't say what happens, but it's atrociously immature writing. There are some scenes that mirror the novel pretty well, but Brunin for some fucking reason changed the chronology of events. Again, the movie doesn't gain anything from the shifting around of details, Brunin just does them. It's mindless alteration for the sake of alteration.  The short of it is that Brunin (writer) and Aja (director) made so many alterations that Horns is no more accurate to the book than Kubrick's Shining was to King's book, albeit without any of the standalone merit Kubrick's film had. Horns the film is an inferior story in literally every way."

stephenking,2rf4tb,IMBarBarryN,8,Tue Jan 6 00:58:00 2015 UTC,"One of the things I adore about Stephen King is that he is always open to letting his style develop and shift. That, to me at least, makes his library very rich and incredibly human. I feel like the people who dismiss him as a hack really aren't paying attention-his work has evolved constantly, and there is so much richness and depth in his works."
stephenking,2rf4tb,mementomori4,4,Mon Jan 5 19:21:09 2015 UTC,"Wow.  Different strokes from different folks.  I'm originally from Bangor and it's nice to see different views but you just knocked out all of his classics.  The Shining, Pet Sematary, 'Salems Lot, the Stand, IT, etc. etc. etc.    I do agree that On Writing is wonderful as is 11/22/63 and Under the Dome (all post accidents).  I enjoyed Dr Sleep but Mr. Mercedes was awful.  The characters were predictable and stereotypical to their character.  I thought I was reading a James Patterson novel for most of it."
stephenking,2rf4tb,IMBarBarryN,3,Mon Jan 5 20:08:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying those were bad. They certainly are classics. When it comes to King's older work, I prefer his short stories. If I want to read his newer things I stick to the Novels.  I grew up in Western Maine btw. I live in the Portland area now :)"
stephenking,2rf4tb,detrimentalistt,2,Mon Jan 5 20:54:06 2015 UTC,"I'm with you. I've long felt that his post-accident works are of much poorer quality than those prior... they lack the subtlety that made his other work so good. I've actually completely avoided Dr Sleep because I don't want it to ruin his other work (especially The Shining) for me.   Like you said, different strokes... I'm not knocking his work in general, but for me, pre-2000 is a zillion times better."
stephenking,2rf4tb,sperling1349,1 point,Mon Jan 5 20:56:34 2015 UTC,"I actually did really enjoy Dr Sleep.  Nothing close to his best stuff but it was good.  I read it after Mr. Mercedes (backwards, I know) and was really worried.  It didn't take anything away from The Shining and didn't try to alter the original story line at all (if that was your worry).  I had a few qualms over it but overall it was a good story."
stephenking,2rf4tb,RisingRapture,4,Thu Jan 8 14:53:11 2015 UTC,"Your title reminded me of this quote from Shawshank Redemption:     There was one fellow who was in for raping a little girl and exposing himself to dozens of others; I got him three pieces of pink Vermont marble and he did three lovely sculptures out of them - a baby, a boy of about twelve, and a bearded young man. He called them The Three Ages of Jesus, and those pieces of sculpture are now in the parlour of a man who used to be governor of this state."
stephenking,2rf4tb,docwilson,3,Mon Jan 5 21:07:59 2015 UTC,"I've read King off and on starting with The Stand.  I decided last year I was going to read his books in order of publication.  Carrie, 'Salem's Lot, Rage (our of order) and I'm listening to The Shining Right now.  I am not going to pay more attention to his three ""ages"" as you call them, maybe I'll get more out of the books that way."
stephenking,2rf4tb,MadDingersYo,3,Mon Jan 5 23:13:23 2015 UTC,"I love the early and the later works. And all in between. I think King's book never deserved that hamburger comparison. Come on, The Shining, a hamburger?! No way."
stephenking,2rf4tb,samhemp,2,Wed Jan 7 00:33:34 2015 UTC,"I would agree, I hate it when people don't recognize his resurgence and just talk about how early king was great and late king is shit."
stephenking,2rf4tb,Markissy,2,Mon Jan 5 20:03:42 2015 UTC,"The only one he released in the last ten years that I didn't like was Mr. Mercedes.   I was thinking of making a post here similar to this one. But I think you did it better.   (And just to brag, what's your count? I'm at 53.)"

But every time i pick it up ill read it a while,  and then i switch to another king novel. I have yet to finish it.  I love the fact that Randal Flagg  is a major character in the story,  as i love The Dark Tower series. For some reason though the book just isn't grabbing me the way other king novels do.  I've seen the movie and enjoyed it thoroughly.  I suppose my major issue with the book is not it's size, but the number of characters in the book and the immensity of each ones back story. I have trouble remembering it all and have trouble following the continuity of it all. I plan to finish it one of these days. But I'm enjoying kings other works right now and I'm currently reading 11/22/63. Next up In eyeing Needful Things.  I watched the movie of that years ago and liked the concept.

IIRC, Jack does know that, though he acts like it doesn't matter. It's also at the root of the struggle between the characters in The Little School, the play he's writing when they remove up to The Overlook.  ETA: He acts like it's NBD, but at some point he barely acknowledges to himself that if he did set the timer ahead, it was to teach George a lesson about not always getting what he wanted, or how to lose."

stephenking,2rb3hb,sewoboe,2,Sun Jan 4 18:32:16 2015 UTC,"That's the only problem I see with reading it this way. Like I said, I had read The Gunslinger but there was a gap of a few years before I picked up the rest. So I was familiar with characters and the world, but couldn't remember all that much in detail.   If there were a way for OP to be given the bare essentials of relevant universe/character information then start with Drawing Of The Three that would be ideal, don't think it can be done though."
stephenking,2rb3hb,MadNially88,1 point,Sun Jan 4 19:13:56 2015 UTC,"My wife did it that way. I told her the story of the first one, then she started with the second one. Then she read The Gunslinger after she finished the series. I think it gave her a unique perspective on it"
stephenking,2rb3hb,Deweyrob2,1 point,Mon Jan 5 12:37:33 2015 UTC,"I did this and I think it's good advice. The Gunslinger is more interesting (IMO) once you get to know Roland as a character, otherwise I think it kind of drags and I could see how it might turn someone off from reading the rest.  OP: start with Drawing of the Three and read the rest in order, then The Gunslinger, then Wind Through the Keyhole, then Little Sisters of Eluria. Optionally read WTtK between 4-5 instead. Knowing how TDT ends, might be interesting to go into TG directly afterwards.  Side note, no spoilers: one of the few series that ended in a way I liked."
stephenking,2rb3hb,Psychopath-,5,Sun Jan 4 18:32:05 2015 UTC,Seems to me that Roland's sacrifice of Jake in Gunslinger is pretty pivotal to the series.

I wish I could answer you in regards to something similar to It but I havent read It in a long long time. I can say that 11/22/63 is an amazing book, even though the end is kinda ... not lame, but... it doesnt have a great finish. BUT I DONT CARE because the hook is the thing, not the reason behind the hook."

stephenking,2rb2e5,grillo7,2,Sun Jan 4 19:00:10 2015 UTC,"I would hold off on reading that one next, not because it isn't great (it is) but because I think you'll appreciate aspects of the book more if you put a little space between IT and 11/22/63...can't say why without spoiling it.  I would go with The Shining, The Dead Zone, or on of the short story or novella collections next, like Night Shift, Different Seasons, or Full Dark No Stars."

It's that good in my opinion.   I have to kindly disagree with the guy above me; the ending is superb. I don't want to say too much, but it's a heck of an ending."

On the one hand, I welcome the adaptation, on the other, its rare for an adaptation to live up to the original... Especially with SK..."
stephenking,2rb2e5,Free_,2,Fri Jan 9 00:27:00 2015 UTC,"Yea I kind of feel the same way. I definitely have made Jake and Sadie a particular way in my own mind, so it might be weird to see it acted out. (I always pictured Sadie looking like Charlize Theron, specifically in this SNL skit a few months ago where she played a 1950's girl.). Of course, I will have to watch the series. There's no way I can't NOT watch it. JJ Abrams is doing it, which gives me some hope.

It does get mixed reviews but I still enjoyed it.  I don't think you could go wrong with any of the other early King novels...The Stand, Pet Sematary and The Shining are all excellent. Of his more recent books I'd suggest 11/22/63.  IT is my favourite Stephen King book :)"

stephenking,2r9pdy,danotoriousnig,1 point,Mon Jan 5 23:15:32 2015 UTC,It is a lot like the movie except for the ending and some subplots. If you liked the movie you'll probably like the book. If you thought the movie was too weird/gross/silly then you might want to read something else first. The people saying the movie was nothing like the book are being a bit hyperbolic.
stephenking,2rajl6,dinesy91,5,Sun Jan 4 10:55:25 2015 UTC,"Jonah Hill and Daniel Radcliffe sound perfect for those parts. Christian Bale as Stuart? I thought Gary Sinese was great in the miniseries, though, so I think it might just be hard for me to imagine anyone else. Also: Jeff Goldblum as Larry Underwood."
stephenking,2rajl6,Psychopath-,1 point,Sun Jan 4 13:46:06 2015 UTC,"It's probably not just you in regards to Stuart, seems to be a bit of a consensus. I love the suggestion by /u/olily of Andrew Lincoln. Definitely a great choice IMO.  Not sure I agree with Jeff Goldblum for Larry Underwood, seems like he might be too old; although I think it's possible there could be someone more appropriate than Bradley Cooper. I think it needs to be someone on the younger end of middle age... someone who could come across as a jaded pop/rock star."
stephenking,2rajl6,Psychopath-,2,Mon Jan 5 00:06:20 2015 UTC,"I agree, Andrew Lincoln is a good thought.  I was thinking the same thing about Jeff Goldblum's age when I wrote the comment but I hadn't seen what he looks like lately. I'd just watched the first Jurassic Park two or three nights ago and Ian Malcolm-era Goldblum seemed like he would've been a good fit for Larry Underwood."
stephenking,2rajl6,carpecupcake,5,Mon Jan 5 00:17:17 2015 UTC,"I don't know, I think either Emma Roberts is too young for Frannie or Christian Bale is too old for Stu. Because the two of them having a relationship together would be a bit weird, in my opinion. I don't remember the age gap being quite that large in the book, although I could be wrong."
stephenking,2rajl6,sasky_81,2,Sun Jan 4 15:09:29 2015 UTC,"There was a fairly significant age gap in the books.  I would have pegged it at 15 - 20 years, although that never gave numbers.  Frannie seemed as though she was 22 - 26 (dating a guy in grad school, still living at home, one or two semesters left of school), while Stu seemed like a solid 35 - 45.  He worked to put his brother through school, his brother as successful, married and had a kid old enough to receive Watership Down as a gift.  He was also married and widowed."
stephenking,2rajl6,GrungeCat,0,Sun Jan 4 16:37:18 2015 UTC,"Not that big of a difference. It states several times in the beginning that Frannie is 21 (""Even now at twenty-one"", ""Sixty-four has a way of forgetting what twenty-one was like"", and stating that Harold is 5 years younger than she is, and he's 16).  As for Stu: ""The marriage had been the best time, and it had only lasted eighteen months. The womb of his young wife had borne a single dark and malignant child. That had been four years ago.""  His wife passed away four years prior to the beginning of the book. So unless there is a huge age difference between the first wife and Stu (which none was mentioned), we can assume that Stu is probably in his late 20s-early 30s. I'd say there's maybe a ten-year or so gap at the most."
stephenking,2rajl6,olily,5,Mon Jan 5 19:12:32 2015 UTC,I want Andrew Lincoln (Rick Grimes on The Walking Dead) to play Stu. That's exactly how I picture Stu in my head. The first episode of The Walking Dead I was blown away how very very much he made me think of Stu.
stephenking,2rajl6,ABirdfart,3,Sun Jan 4 14:24:24 2015 UTC,Pretty good list. I don't know how good Shia LaBeouf is at playing crazy people but I could totally Imagine him as Kid.
stephenking,2rajl6,Monsieur-Anana,2,Sun Jan 4 13:07:34 2015 UTC,He was a crazy person in real life for a while there.  I'm sure he could easily do some method acting.
stephenking,2rajl6,AGhostLP,2,Mon Jan 5 12:44:56 2015 UTC,"Tom Hardy is sort of a chameleon-- I think he'd be better suited to Trashcan Man than Lloyd.   I don't picture Christian Bale as Stuart. Stuart is really a good ole' boy and there is the romantic arc with Frannie. I picture someone younger than Bale, and little more average (or made to look ""average"") in terms of looks. Who that is, I don't know!"

stephenking,2rajl6,ChronoTravis85,1 point,Mon Jan 5 00:50:58 2015 UTC,"Randall Flagg - Matthew McConaughey, but I think Michael Shannon would have also been a great Flagg Stu Redman - Joshua Jackson, although I actually think they should cast a minority in this role because, despite having a very large cast, The Stand doesn't have many major characters that aren't white, and I just don't find that realistic. Larry Underwood - Joshua Jackson Frances Goldsmith - Elizabeth Olsen Trashcan Man - Woody Harrelson Nick Andros - Joseph Gordon-Levitt Glenn Bateman - Morgan Freeman Lloyd Henried - Nicolas Cage   Edit: A lot of people have been saying Andrew Lincoln for Stu Redman, but he will probably still be tied up with The Walking Dead when filming begins for The Stand, and the two characters are just too similar - actors generally don't like to repeat themselves. I don't think Lincoln would want to play two soft-spoken, strong redneck type characters in an a apocalyptic setting two times in a row."
stephenking,2rajl6,hughsocash45,1 point,Mon Jan 5 02:08:20 2015 UTC,This isn't what Hollywood has in mind I'm sure but here's my picks:   Stu Redman- Andrew Lincoln.   Fran Goldsmith- Elizabeth Olsen.   Glenn Bateman- Dustin Hoffman   Harold Lauder- Not really sure. I've just imagined him as an annoying fat kid with black hair :-)  Randall Flagg- Gary Oldman  Loyd- Woody Harrelson  Trashcan Man- Sam Rockwell   Nick Andros- Joseph Gordon Levitt  Tom Cullen- Josh Brolin   Ralph Brentner- John C Riley  Mother Abigail- Cicily Tyson  The Kid- Joaquin Phoenix   Julie Lawry- The chick who played Beth on The Walking Dead  Judge Farris- Morgan Freeman   Nadine Cross- The lady who played Andrea on the Walking Dead   Lucy Swan- Judy Greer  Susan Stern- The chick who played Laurie on The Walking Dead   I'm probably missing a few characters but keep in mind that I haven't finished the book yet and there are so many characters it's hard to remember all of them without reading the book.   Edit: Idiot! Forgot! Larry Underwood: James McAvoy
stephenking,2rajl6,ChronoTravis85,1 point,Mon Jan 5 04:24:13 2015 UTC,"I hadn't thought of Sam Rockwell for Trash, but that is actually a good casting idea. I like Gary Oldman a lot, but I don't think he is physically close enough to the way Flagg is portrayed in the books. Flagg is supposed to be tall, muscular, and physically imposing and intimdating, and that is not what Oldman is, but McConaughey fits the bill. Also, I always thought that Oldman and Rockwell look like they could be father and son, so it would be strange seeing them on screen together :) I actually think that Freeman would make a great Glenn Bateman, but he would also be good for the Judge, as they were somewhat similar mentor type characters anyway."
stephenking,2rajl6,hughsocash45,1 point,Mon Jan 5 14:44:33 2015 UTC,Yeah. I figured Sam Rockwell would do well as Trash as he's been known for playing nutty characters. Like Wild Bill in the Green Mile.
stephenking,2rajl6,hughsocash45,1 point,Mon Jan 5 16:53:13 2015 UTC,"Also, Gary Oldman is the modern day man of a thousand faces. He's also been known to play villains pretty frequently. So that's why I think he'd make a good Flagg. They can make him a vampire, a disfigured serial killer victim, a cop, and it all worked will in my opinion. They can make him up and he can give enough charisma to look and act like Flagg. He's the kind of actor that can play anybody."
stephenking,2rajl6,ChronoTravis85,1 point,Mon Jan 5 16:56:06 2015 UTC,"I have no doubt that he has the acting abilities, but Flagg needs to tower over others, which could be don without visual effects. I think Michael Shannon would also make a good Flagg."

stephenking,2r85g6,leaf71,6,Sat Jan 3 19:49:59 2015 UTC,Exactly this. His books make you question reality itself.
stephenking,2r85g6,Simius,9,Mon Jan 5 05:18:42 2015 UTC,"It's written precisely that way on purpose.  It's a Lovecraftian novel, meaning it's part of the cosmic horror sub-genre, which is very, very bleak."
stephenking,2r85g6,Darthac,5,Sat Jan 3 22:08:16 2015 UTC,"Right. I had just never read a Lovecraftian tale that was as fully, nightmarishly realized as Revival."
stephenking,2r85g6,Darthac,8,Sat Jan 3 22:10:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think I've ever read an entire novel that's been written in the cosmic horror style other than Revival; usually it's short stories.  But yeah, Revival is the slow burn with all that hopelessness at the end.  King did a really good job with this one, I think."
stephenking,2r85g6,Abraxas_1134,8,Sat Jan 3 22:30:44 2015 UTC,"Agreed. The novel length is what made it so effective. The King short story Crouch End explored similar themes, but it was less consequential because of the length. You get to know the characters so well in Revival, and all their little moments are so lovingly written, which makes it so much more of a gut punch when he casts them all to hell in the end."
stephenking,2r85g6,MadDingersYo,9,Sat Jan 3 23:14:07 2015 UTC,"Welcome to cosmic horror!  I loved this book for exactly that reason.  When I read it, it felt like King wrote it all the way until the curtain gets pulled down around reality.  Then Lovecraft took over, and the epilogue is King trying to wrestle the book back from him."

I thought it was going in a more Frankenstein way, which is what I think ol' Charlie wanted to some degree, but it went oh-so-wrong."
stephenking,2r85g6,MadDingersYo,6,Sun Jan 4 17:38:37 2015 UTC,"It was fucking fantastic. Didn't care much for his last couple of novels but I'm a huge Lovecraft fan so thought this to be a little masterpiece... Also reminded me of his short story about the sinister giant rock in the desert (anyone?... been awhile). Astrid storyline toward the end was sort of cheesy and expected but man did the plot resolve everything nicely and leave you with just enough to hold onto as you crawl under your covers and stare into the unknown and let your imagination run wild. Not too many monologue tangents in this one either. I teared up a few times. Altogether pretty original, and I breezed through it."

Different Seasons is a great collection, but I can't remember how much about Derry is in there (pretty sure The Body is)"
stephenking,2r7jor,brandscaping,2,Sat Jan 3 17:01:07 2015 UTC,"surely you aren't suggesting op should stop reading it. after that though, stand should become top priority. maybe a few shorter works inbetween, though I can't recommend tom gordon. different seasons is great though (except for the breathing method)."

stephenking,2r7jor,brandscaping,2,Sat Jan 3 19:03:19 2015 UTC,It would be a good one to learn more about Derry since it's set there and all. I agree with everyone else that The Stand is a must read.

I was like that with Castle Rock after I read Cujo. I then read Needful Things which was awesome. In terms of Castle Rock novels, just The Dark Half and The Dead Zone to go but I read a spoiler for the ending of Zone somewhere :("
stephenking,2r7jor,4verticals,2,Sun Jan 4 00:04:38 2015 UTC,"I read IT before 11/22/63 so the little throwback to Bev and Richie  was a nice easter egg. That interaction wouldn't have effected IT in any way since The Losers Club left Derry and lost their memories, Bev and Richie wouldn't have remembered the conversation,  and thus found no need to mention the stranger who walked into their lives one summer afternoon.  This also begs the question as to why Jake remembered Derry after leaving when the losers couldn't. Is it because he's an Adult and they were children, in effect strengthening his memory of the town.  My other theory is the effect of the door in Al's Diner which allows him and Al to remember what's happened in the past even though they went at different times.  I'm thinking of picking up 'Needful Things' next.  I vaguely remember watching the Film adaptation as a child,  but now that I'm invested in kings work and love all of the story's that have been set in Derry they I've read thus far.  That's my suggestion."
stephenking,2r7jor,Monsieur-Anana,2,Sun Jan 4 12:59:06 2015 UTC,"I'm a big fan of the short story collections. Pick up Skeleton Crew and Night Shift. They have some of King's best short stories, if not the best. There's not really anything Derry related, but they're still good reads.  I haven't read it, but I heard Insomnia is good and that takes places in Derry."
stephenking,2r916w,4verticals,5,Sun Jan 4 00:00:57 2015 UTC,There are diffrent kinds of fantasy. Not everything is for everyone. Song of Fire and Ice were to long winded for me but if you ever fill like you want to change things up dark tower is a good option. Stephen King is much more than a horror writer. The charactors that he dreams up are some of the best I have ever had the chance to meet. To only read Stephen King to be scared you are missing out on some great stories.
stephenking,2r916w,crashdemon,1 point,Sun Jan 4 00:28:22 2015 UTC,"I felt the same feelings toward The Dark Tower series before I started it. King is more than just a horror author, he has written some phenomenal stories not related to this genre ('11/22/63' and 'Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption' to name a few). I gave The Gunslinger a try one day since it is a short novel and the writing style shocked me. It is unlike King's normal work. Upon finishing it I was turned off from the series, but immediately dived into The Drawing of the Three since I heard to do so. This novel was back on track to King's normal writing style, and I absolutely loved the concept of it and enjoyed every page. These books are so many genres packed into one entity. I can't put my finger on the exact genre where this series stands, but all I can say is it takes elements from almost all of King's works and meshes them into one series that is a hell of a ride. I say give it a shot, but at the least read the first two novels in the series. If you don't like it after the second one then move on."
stephenking,2r916w,kinger282,1 point,Sun Jan 4 06:44:31 2015 UTC,"I think what drew me into the Dark Tower series as a kid was how gritty it was. It felt more ""real"" to me because of how disturbing and dark the adventure could get, while being sprinkled occasionally with hope. That said, everybody is different, if it doesnt appeal to you then that's just fine."

stephenking,2r0bf2,WeAreAllYellow,1 point,Thu Jan 1 22:14:37 2015 UTC,"Ha my year was very similar to yours.  I read the Dark Tower series in 2013 (basically the first thing I've read by King) and then this past year I had been alternating between a King book and a non-King book.  The King books I read last year were: * The Stand (amazing) * 11/22/63 (surprised how much I liked it) * IT (scariest I read, classic) * The Eyes of the Dragon (enjoyable)  * The Running Man (disappointed me a little) * Wind Through the Keyhole (nice to be back in Midworld),  * The Talisman (liked it) * Black House (like it more than Talisman, appreciated DT references) * Salem's Lot (really enjoyed it, a little dated though) * Colorado Kid (I second your ""meh"") * Under the Dome (really liked it but end sucked) * Cell (just started, so far, so good)  So I guess my totals for my 2 years of reading King are 7 in 2013 and 11 in 2014.  I really don't have a pattern, just go to the store or library and pick the one that seems most interesting to me at the time.  I still have some classics left (Misery, Shining) but think I might save them for a little later.    Good luck this year, let me know how it's going and if you have any that you've read that you highly recommend.  Happy new year!"

stephenking,2r0a9a,bottomlinebeast,5,Thu Jan 1 15:02:09 2015 UTC,Under the dome is an exercise in the human condition. It also has insanely good character development.
stephenking,2r0a9a,bottomlinebeast,2,Thu Jan 1 15:04:33 2015 UTC,Under the Dome's ending could be a major turnoff for first timers.
stephenking,2r0a9a,TheMFDrez,2,Fri Jan 2 02:59:58 2015 UTC,I guess. The same can be said for literally any book though.

It was way different than I thought it would be - it was the first Stephen King fiction book I read (I actually read On Writing first). Before reading it, I'd never bothered with him bc I didn't think I liked horror. After reading that book I now want to read EVERYTHING of his, horror or not. He's just that good. ♥   (The only other ones I have read are On Writing <- super recommend, even though it's not fiction, 'Salems Lot and Joyland. All were excellent.)"

stephenking,2r0a9a,Modest_Cake,2,Thu Jan 1 17:47:52 2015 UTC,Oh Misery. Yep. Great book for people who aren't sure about horror. It's more psychological thriller I feel.
stephenking,2r0a9a,white_pony_girl,3,Fri Jan 2 12:41:06 2015 UTC,It is a great one.  Any collection of King short stories is also usually good enough to get people hooked.
stephenking,2r0a9a,cliffyfrolk30,3,Thu Jan 1 16:08:02 2015 UTC,"My fiancee got started with the Stand, but she also loved Salem's Lot (her second King book).  So I'd recommend Salem's Lot, its also a good way to get her to read a quality vampire story, which is important with all the vampire schlock getting thrown around nowadays.  However, if she doesn't read fiction all that much, maybe starting with a short story is the way to go. So many to choose from!"
stephenking,2r0a9a,Beaser,3,Thu Jan 1 16:11:34 2015 UTC,"The Girl who Loved Tom Gordon is a great starting point. At least, that's where I started. Less gruesome and scare, more psychological and creepy. Good way to ease in into imo"

I just read it today and she was totally right. The first half of this short story (which is actually quite long) I was very frustrated and annoyed, and it's definitely aimed at the female readers. But it's probably going to get your girlfriend interested in King's work."

stephenking,2qy7dy,Prince-Cola,21,Wed Dec 31 20:32:16 2014 UTC,Uncut and unabridged restores a character arc/journey due to the printing press not being able to print the size. He polishes up the book by fixing small errors like the babe Ruth wrappers having a different appearance back in the day.  The earlier version of the book will have less material.  Uncut and unabridged is the path.
stephenking,2qy7dy,Hypnyp,2,Wed Dec 31 20:45:23 2014 UTC,was payday (and a milky way) but other than that you are correct.

stephenking,2qy7dy,ShoegazingStardust,7,Wed Dec 31 22:50:51 2014 UTC,He doesn't change anything completely. No character will be doing something differently. They will be doing more things though and characterization will be more fleshed out.   Read the long uncut one. But go to the store and read the foreword before you buy. King himself explains why the uncut one is the one you should read
stephenking,2qy7dy,Damien__,6,Wed Dec 31 23:45:00 2014 UTC,"I probably read the first, abridged version 5 times or more before buying the unabridged version, and I LOVE the unabridged version.

stephenking,2qy7dy,JadeTheMoose,2,Sat Jan 17 19:42:31 2015 UTC,"Uncut and unabridged, for sure. It includes what he was told to take out by his editors and to be honest once I was lost in the story I didn't notice the extra length.   Besides, the book is so brilliant you'll end up reading the unabridged version anyways just so you can get further into the characters' world."

I love Under The Dome and it has IMHO some of King's best character work, but it's not the classic horror King's known for among casual readers. I'd say read Under The Dome and maybe try out Different Seasons to get a sense of what other things King writes about."

stephenking,2qwxdy,docfunbags,3,Wed Dec 31 13:13:01 2014 UTC,It wws my first sk book. At first I thought it was messy with too many characters for me to follow the story but then when I took the lead of the book I LOVED it. Its by far one of the best books I've read.

I personally loved The Regulators more, it hits hard and moves at such a fast pace you barely get time to recover from the last shock before the next one hits you."
stephenking,2qt61w,Zetsubouromance,2,Tue Dec 30 18:36:52 2014 UTC,"Desperation is one of my favorite King books. It's so well-written I really felt like I was in the story immediately. Some of his books take me a minute to get into, but this one caught my interest from the first chapter. Enjoy!"
stephenking,2qt61w,the_midnight_rider,2,Tue Dec 30 16:04:12 2014 UTC,I'd do it chronologically. These are from three different eras of King's writing. You can see his writing style evolving as he goes from young punk to mature craftsman.
stephenking,2qt61w,leaf71,2,Tue Dec 30 16:33:31 2014 UTC,"Desperation is a good book. Night Shift is King's first short story collection, has some really good ones in it."
stephenking,2qt61w,RisingRapture,2,Tue Dec 30 22:38:49 2014 UTC,Desperation is probably my favorite so Im gonna say that one :)

Then she fell silent and they all seemed helpless to proceed further - a group of three dots which, when connected, would form a triangle whose exact shape could not yet be foreseen.    [double paragraph break]    ""Ouuuu,"" Frannie said, easing herself down on a mossy patch at the base of an old elm beside the road. ""I'm never going to get the callouses of my fanny, Harold.""    Harold uttered a surly grunt.    She turned to Stu.  ""Have you ever ridden a hundred and seventy miles on a Honda, Mr. Redman?"" Not recommended.""    .... I think that in the paragraph break there was an implied, unimportant break during which there was an unrecorded exchange of names, and that the pause might not have come over in audio format.  I've copied this out of my new copy of The Stand and I've only just realised it's the original version, not the uncut, so there could be a difference."

stephenking,2qtlkb,Modest_Cake,2,Tue Dec 30 16:16:38 2014 UTC,Yeah I read the unedited version...still seems weird that even if I'm listening to the edited version that they would cut an introduction.
stephenking,2qr0bb,IndianaJwns,6,Mon Dec 29 21:46:01 2014 UTC,"I received this as a Christmas gift from my Aunt, who found it in the thrift store where she works.  It's been adapted obviously, but is still faithful to the original book (one of my favorites, in fact).  I had never heard of a Stephen King title being made into a pop-up book (never mind adapted for children), and I was incredibly surprised by how well it's all arranged."
stephenking,2qr0bb,Nowin,2,Mon Dec 29 21:50:14 2014 UTC,"That looks awesome! I read that book a few months ago and loved the visuals, and it looks like it was pretty spot on with that book. That's really cool."
stephenking,2qr0bb,chillbill69,3,Tue Dec 30 07:32:18 2014 UTC,I got this as soon as it came out. Now have two copies (one still in the plastic). It's a pretty good book and like you say it's pretty true to the original novel.

stephenking,2qrn4a,no_capes,4,Tue Dec 30 01:07:25 2014 UTC,"My two favorite from since '94 are probably Desperation and Just After Sunset.    To me, Desperation is well-paced and engaging throughout.  The basic premise isn't the most original thing of all time, but I think SK executes it very well.  I also appreciate the way he revisits some of his thinking on religion as found in The Stand.    I am really fond of SK's short stories, so Just After Sunset is a bit of a no-brainer for me.  Although there is a bit of repetition of ideas, just about every piece in the collection remains satisfying.  As much as I love the epic novels, part of SK's genius shines best when restricted in scope.  Also, N. is one of my favorite things he has ever written.  My two least favorites from the era in question are probably Rose Madder and From a Buick 8.  Rose Madder is kind of an easy target, as I am pretty sure even the author hasn't had much positive to say about it since its release.  On the other hand, it isn't like this book gets singled out at random; it has its flaws.  As the concluding installment of what I have seen called SK's Lifetime Movies trilogy (previous entries include Delores Claibourne and Gerald's Game), the ideas are not particularly fresh.  Moreover, SK has always been a proponent of ""write what you know"" and he seems a little out of his depth here.  As a result, something he is trying to be genuine about comes off as awkward and cliched.  From a Buick 8 seems to have its defenders, but I am not one of them.  To me, it came off like he was trying to prove a point instead of tell a story, and I was left wondering what exactly that point was.  I don't need a cut-and-dry explanation in order to be satisfied with a story; the problem with this one is that there just isn't all that much story to it in my opinion.  Although it isn't even all that long by SK standards, I felt like I had used the same amount of effort that it took to read IT or The Stand.  The core of this book isn't bad, I just wish it had been cut down to something that could slot into one of his novella collections.  With most of his stuff that I am not real enthusiastic about, I'm willing to give anything another shot a couple years down the road.  Don't see that happening with this one.  Great thread idea!  Hope to see more discussion of later-but-not-necessarily-the-latest stuff."
stephenking,2qrn4a,orval_rodenbacher,2,Tue Dec 30 03:36:32 2014 UTC,first let me preface this by saying I still enjoyed the books i chose as my least favorites quite a bit but if forced to choose those would be the ones i liked the least.  (favorites : 1. Insomnia       2. The Green Mile) (least favorites: 1. Rose Madder               2. The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon)
stephenking,2qrn4a,acassese,2,Tue Dec 30 02:31:28 2014 UTC,"I really enjoyed Green Mile and 11/22/63. I'd go as far as to put the 11/22/63 up there with The Stand, It, and The Shining as one of his best overall novels. I really did not enjoy Under the Dome all that much, although I think a lot of people did like it."
stephenking,2qrn4a,ChronoTravis85,2,Tue Dec 30 02:36:34 2014 UTC,"My least two favorites books are probably Rose Madder and Black House. Rose Madder is a no-brainer for most people, its just not a great book. I did not like Black House because of how shoehorned the Dark Tower stuff felt, and how weak the second half of the book was, which was disappointing because I loved reading The Talisman.  My two favorites are Wizard and Glass and Lisey's Story. I think Wizard and Glass is one of the best stories he's ever written, where everything was just perfect in terms of the characters and the flow of the story. With Lisey's Story I also thought that it was just so well written throughout. Lisey's Story even has a good ending, which as a SK fan you don't run into very often."
stephenking,2qrn4a,Tuvor77,3,Tue Dec 30 10:59:38 2014 UTC,I loved Wizard and Glass in part because King does in it what he does so well in many of his novels...he goes into a character's past and explores it in such a way that we understand him/her better.  He also does this with locations (like Derry in It).  One of my favorite aspects of his writing.
stephenking,2qrn4a,AlexandrianVagabond,2,Wed Dec 31 04:35:35 2014 UTC,"Least favorite: 1) Dreamcatcher - all I remember from it is SSDD 2) Cell - just didn't grab me, I suppose.  I remember it being intense in some moments, but kind of felt forced. Favorite (this is hard, I could pick so many for very different reasons): 1) Duma Key - totally engrossing and very frightening.  Also, not a total win for the ""good"" team. 2) Wizard and Glass - my favorite book in the DT series.  I love Roland's history and his relationship with Susan is heartbreaking.  I cry every time I read it, and I've probably read the entire series at least 10 times."
stephenking,2qrn4a,rph80,2,Tue Dec 30 18:37:14 2014 UTC,"Dreamcatcher: Shit weasels.  Seriously.  Shit weasels.  Thought about this one for least favorite, but it had some aspects I enjoyed.  Cell: Another one I briefly considered, as it has some problems.  On the other hand, SK is obviously uncomfortable with cell phones, and I can't blame him.  He didn't grow up with them, and more importantly, so many of his classic plots would be totally unworkable in the cell-phone age.  I feel like maybe he was trying to work something out there.  Duma Key: I was astounded at how well I liked that book.  At first it felt like he was dragging me into his shit related to getting hit by a car, but things really picked up and I loved the conclusion, which doesn't happen too often.  Wizard and Glass: I dig coming to this sub because there are always people talking up books that I am not into.  All the Constant Readers I know in real life are down on this entry of the Dark Tower, as am I, but it is fascinating to see other perspectives."
stephenking,2qrn4a,orval_rodenbacher,1 point,Wed Dec 31 01:30:32 2014 UTC,The main complaint that most people seem to have with Wizard and Glass is that the ka-tet doesn't advance enough.  I think that the entire epic is about the journey and growth and Roland's ability to come out of his hard-case shell is a major aspect of that.  Telling his story and opening up about what he feels is his greatest fault is an advancement in my mind.  What are you down on about it?  Totally agree with you about Duma Key.
stephenking,2qrn4a,rph80,3,Wed Dec 31 01:40:05 2014 UTC,"On the one hand, I'm in the camp of those complaining about the ka-tet not advancing, but that isn't all of it.  SK wants to (or has to) punt on the main story here I think.  It seems like he isn't sure what to do and is afraid of fucking it up.  So we get Roland's past, and that's cool, I want that.  What I don't want is one story about Roland's past drawn out to hell and gone.  Wizard and Glass is a pretty good yarn with some great players (I'm big on Rhea and Jonas), but I'm worried about Roland.  Developing Cuthbert and Alain and Susan and Aunt Cord is cool or whatever, but I'd rather see this story reined in (LOL HORSE PUN CUZ THEY HAVE HORSES IN MEJIS) and hear about some other stuff alluded to, e.g. fall of Gilead, Jericho Hill, Roland looking for the Tower and determining he must hunt the Man in Black, hell, even Aileen (who?) coming through the hedges while the ladies play at points.  I feel like he had some ideas he didn't get to, and while Wind in the Keyhole was great, it wasn't real satisfying.  I also don't like the way that the Wizard of Oz shit comes and goes.  Why work it in if it isn't a big factor?  It seems like he just didn't know what he wanted.  The return of Ticky is this thing that could be major but he just gets cut down no big deal.  That goes for a lot of the later DT though, I mean after all the Crimson King buildup (see end of The Gunslinger) the resolution is pretty lame.  Wizard and Glass isn't a bad book, I just view it as a weak link in the DT chain, partly because the main story doesn't advance, and partly because its ostensible purpose of illuminating Roland could have been more imaginative and better accomplished in my estimation.  The story it tells is page-turning-compelling, like nearly everything SK does, but it nonetheless left me wanting more.  To me, the best parts are still those focusing on the interaction and activity of the ka-tet, even if there isn't a ton happening for them.  Eddie's reflection on getting fucked up and cruising the turnpike versus being in an alien post-apocalyptic landscape with people he loves always gets me.  I'm about 100 pages out from wrapping up Drawing of the Three on my fourth trip through the DT cycle, and interested to see how Wizard and Glass grabs me this time around.  I expect to enjoy the setting as always, and hope to find something about Roland that wasn't obvious before.  I have more to say about this stuff but I'm hammered and about to go to a show.  I don't expect or want to change anyone's opinions about some seriously subjective stuff, but if you want to continue the discussion I will try later."
stephenking,2qrn4a,orval_rodenbacher,1 point,Wed Dec 31 02:26:29 2014 UTC,"I appreciate your perspective on this, and I'm not trying to change anyone's opinion.  I agree that there are some things that feel like unfulfilled promises (Aileen and Tick-Tock are good examples).  I justify a lot of these by looking at the overall philosophy of the DT series which, I feel, really comes through at the end of book 7.  I like how DT and WaG, in particular, have a doubling effect (not unlike Twinners from The Talisman).  Roland's current Ka-Tet has a lot of similarities to his first, especially in abilities and personalities.  Roland's quest forces him to grow as an individual and doubling back on the story to show his growth as a Gunslinger and a leader (""I was right, but for the wrong reasons, which makes me all wrong.""  I think that's the quote but probably not exact) both in Mejis and with his current Ka-tet is an important part of the journey.  I think that the graphic novels fill in more of this history and fulfill some of those literary promises.  I also like to think that each journey to the tower would answer different questions and have different parts of Roland's history revealed.  We can only see so much on each journey and what's most important in that cycle."
stephenking,2qrn4a,rph80,1 point,Wed Dec 31 19:32:57 2014 UTC,"Great points!  I'll bear them in mind on my upcoming trip through WnG.  The book will always be what it is, so instead of wanting more I should focus on getting more out of what is there.  I dabbled in the graphic novels a bit but wasn't feeling them too much, might be time to take another look.  Are they available electronically at all?"
stephenking,2qrn4a,orval_rodenbacher,1 point,Wed Dec 31 23:36:48 2014 UTC,"Don't know if the graphic novels are available electronically.  They're done by Marvel so my best guess would be to check their site, but I have no idea.  Thanks for the convo."
stephenking,2qrn4a,rph80,2,Fri Jan 2 16:24:27 2015 UTC,"Best (not including Dark Tower):   11/22/63 -- I agree with many that this is one of the best novels he's written, and definitely the best from 94 onward. Insomnia -- What can I say, it's maybe a little too long, but I really liked the mythology King started to develop further about the tower, even if he kind of threw it under the bus later. Also, its always great to be back in Derry.   Worst:   Cell -- Forgettable and kind of ridiculous.  From a Buick 8 -- I kind of like the core idea of the story, but not at novel length. I didn't much care for this one."
stephenking,2qrn4a,grillo7,1 point,Thu Jan 1 01:31:16 2015 UTC,"Oh man twenty years is a long time.  I reallly enjoyed Revival.  While not scary i loved the Bachman style ending.  I would elaborate but don't want to be that guy that spoils.  Also the Short Story ""N"" from Just after Sunset.  Ive read the story itself multiple times and no joke prolly listened to it at least 20 times.  That story will keep with you for days and days.  Eight keeps things strait.  Least favorite?  Dream Catcher and a tie between the Dark Half and Rose Madder."
stephenking,2qrn4a,CptnTrips,1 point,Fri Jan 2 06:21:36 2015 UTC,"Favorite On Writing - I've read that more than any other King book. It fills me with so much joy and it's a great addendum to the biographical parts of Danse Macabre 11/22/63 - I have never read an 800 page book so fast. My undergrad was in American History, so that helped.  Least Favorite Cell - It wasn't the worst King book I've ever read, that honor goes to Cujo, but it wasn't that great either. The story just kind of ran out of steam. Regulators - Maybe I unfairly compared it to Desperation, but it just seemed a bit too hokey for my liking."
stephenking,2qrexq,NSAUNIT20,3,Mon Dec 29 23:52:02 2014 UTC,"Well, 11/22/63 is quite long, so if you enjoyed that then you might like The Stand too :) I love both of those books. If you really want to read the best of King, then you have to try these: The Stand, It, Carrie, The Shining, The Dark Tower series, Green Mile, any of his short story collections, The Talisman, Black House, Doctor Sleep, Eyes of the Dragon, Bag of Bones. These are some of my favorites."

""What I did was take all the spades out of a deck of cards plus a joker. Ace to King = 1-13. Joker = 14. I shuffled the cards and dealt them. The order in which they came out of the deck became the order of the stories, based on their position in the list my publisher sent me. And it actually created a very nice balance between the literary stories and the all-out screamers. I also added an explanatory note before or after each story, depending on which seemed the more fitting position. Next collection: selected by Tarot.""  Or read Everything's Eventual if you haven't. I've found that unless you're reading The Tower series it doesn't really matter. Everybody could give a different suggestion."

They tend to pack all the scary punch with a lot less length.  No one does short stories like Stephen.  Skeleton Crew, Just After Sunset and Everything is Eventual are especially good. Also Four past Midnight.  Short story in that called ""The Langoliers"" is fucking gold."

I could tell it was one of his earlier novels but I still found it really enjoyable, probably because I love vampire tropes and thought he put an interesting twist on them.

I personally have a hard time quitting something I've already started reading, even if I don't enjoy it. Just feels like giving up to me."

It's really well put together, and i personally find that some books are easier to swallow if someone else is reading it.  With Audio books you can really focus more on imagining what's happening, rather than having to sit and read the words.  Kind of reminds me of story time like when you were a child. I think they're still running a free month promotion which means you can get the book free.  That is if you don't already have an account.  It's 14.95 but if you subscribe you get your first month free.  After the first month it goes up to full price,  however, if you try to cancel your subscription they'll give you 3 months at 7.49, so half off.  Each month comes with 1 audible book credit and discounted prices on most,  if not all, of the books in the store."
stephenking,2qn47b,CygnusX1,3,Mon Jan 5 14:08:42 2015 UTC,1)  Not everything a writer writes is good and sometimes those things actually make it to print even though they shouldn't.  2)  Not everything a writer writes is going to be judged exactly the same by each person who reads it.    King is a writer who has written so much that he is bound to write a lot of both of those.  Sometimes the answer is to put the book down and move on.  I find with King that sometimes coming back to it later lets me get through it easier.

Seconding The Long Walk as one of my favorites too, but I didn't realize that until a year or two ago either."

I think he's returned to form a little bit with Revival, and I really liked Joyland, but Dr Sleep did nothing for me and I couldn't finish Mr Mercedes. I didn't like the Dark Tower books 6 / 7"

I enjoyed how they fleshed out the back story between Eddie and Henry in the first four issues, but this last one was flying through plot points.  I'm going to keep reading, but the quality of art and writing shifted way back during The Fall of Gilead issues, and was very inconsistent after The Battle of Jericho Hill storyline ended, and I can't help but wonder if Marvel didn't feel like it was worth allocating resources.  For these issues in particular I don't care for Kowalski's art style - everything feels rather cartoon-y."

It was insultingly bad, because it was bad in areas we know King can excel in.  Read the last story from Full Dark, No Stars (A Good Marriage) and compare it to Mr. Mercedes.  Apart from King's recognisable voice (and a bunch of reused tropes) it's as though they were written by two writers at two completely different stages of experience.

This book did not have a single character I found interesting.  The story felt like a generic knockoff of a Criminal Minds episode.    That being said, I hope OP enjoys it.  Its not bad, just not great by King Standards."

stephenking,2q9ucs,sadgasm420,30,Wed Dec 24 12:17:03 2014 UTC,"Pet Sematary for sure. It's horrifying on at least three different levels, probably more. I recently got it in my head that I ought to reread it and now I'm three-quarters through and realizing I do NOT want to finish it. I've been having nightmares practically since the first day I started.   It's so good though. So, so good.  Edit: or It. I just remembered that when I first read It I slept with the lights on for a month. I reread it often and it doesn't scare me as much now, but certain parts always get me and probably always will.  Edit again: Or Gerald's Game and Delores Claiborne. Those aren't really scary, per se, but so fucking disturbing. That... degloving..."
stephenking,2q9ucs,TotallyNot_MikeDirnt,5,Wed Dec 24 12:54:02 2014 UTC,It also had a lasting effect on me. Just how death was discussed in that book was one of the most enlightening things that I've read.

stephenking,2q9ucs,notgravy,2,Wed Dec 24 15:21:50 2014 UTC,"This is the only book that has legitimately scared me. The Shining had a couple times where I was a bit creeped out or whatever, but nothing close to Pet Sematery."
stephenking,2q9ucs,handinhand12,2,Wed Dec 24 19:07:30 2014 UTC,IT took me two attempts to read. The first time I tried I was about 13 and I couldn't get past the description of Georgie's arm being ripped off.... I tried again when I was about 16-17 and had to push myself to keep reading at that part. What was pretty awesome and added to it is that at night I actually had to read it with an oil lamp as my only light. We had no power for a while at my old house so I read by sunlight through the window by day and oil lamp by night. I actually enjoyed reading by oil lamp because as I said it really added to the book. I'm honestly surprised I didn't have nightmares.
stephenking,2q9ucs,Captain-Zebra-Tits,2,Wed Dec 24 20:39:59 2014 UTC,"Funnily, I can't remember ever having actual nightmares about It, only being absolutely terrified of being in the dark or going anywhere alone.

stephenking,2q9ucs,Michele1563,0,Sun Dec 28 13:52:49 2014 UTC,"Funny that, I didn't really find Pet Sematary that scary, in fact I would say the scariest part of it was the story of the bull."

stephenking,2q9ucs,RogerDeanVenture,9,Wed Dec 24 13:39:53 2014 UTC,I think what did it for me with Salem's Lot was when Callahan was forced to drink Barlow's blood. That scene is straight up evil.

Hop out of my bed, speed walk down that hallway, bolt up the stairs, completely sure theres something right behind me.    He has a way of sucking you in like no other author I've ever read."
stephenking,2qaetc,futurealex,4,Wed Dec 24 16:36:57 2014 UTC,"He's a dude with serious issues, both alcoholism and anger management. These stream in turn from a fucked-up childhood (something we never see in the Kubrick movie, incidentally). But I don't think there's any doubt that there's a supernatural influence at work, too. He didn't get out of that walk-in fridge by himself. That thing seems to prefer working through human agents, and through the memories of past horrors, rather than exposing itself directly, though. I'm pretty sure that it's something similar to the thing behind Pennywise in It - some kind of malevolent entity that's not from this Earth/reality, working mostly (but not only) through psychic influence.  The fascinating thing about The Shining is how we see the hotel corrupting Jack from the inside out, all from Jack's point of view. We're inside his head, and at first he's pretty realistic about himself, but as things go by he starts blaming others more and more, externalizing his own issues on his wife, his child, his boss, etc. And then, the bar scene happens. Suddenly we're outside his head, watching the hotel finish eating what's left of his agency. It might be one of the most chilling scenes in the novel, because it's so subtle.  It's one of the strength of the novel, I think, that most of his characters are so unlikeable. Might just be me, but...Jack is an asshole, even on his good days. Wendy is kind of a milksop. The only nice character apart from Danny is Halloran, really. But they work as characters because they're realistic, and you root for them despite of their flaws."

stephenking,2q36lt,autowikibot,2,Mon Dec 22 18:11:42 2014 UTC,"Section 1. Plot summary of article  The Shining %28novel%29:       The Shining mainly takes place in the fictional Overlook Hotel, an isolated, haunted resort located in the Colorado Rockies. The history of the hotel, which is described in backstory by several characters, includes the deaths of some of its guests and of former winter caretaker Delbert Grady, who succumbed to cabin fever and killed his family and himself.  The plot centers on Jack Torrance, his wife Wendy, and their five-year-old son Danny, who move into the hotel after Jack accepts the position as winter caretaker. Jack is characterized as an aspiring writer  and recovering alcoholic with anger issues troubled by past binges that, prior to the story, had caused him to accidentally break Danny's arm and lose his position as a teacher. Jack hopes that the seclusion at the hotel will help him reconnect with his family and give him the motivation needed to work on a play. Danny, unbeknownst to his parents, possesses telepathic abilities referred to as the ""shining"" that enable him to read minds and experience premonitions. Dick Hallorann, the chef of the Overlook, senses Danny's abilities and helps to explain them to him, giving Hallorann and Danny a special connection.   As the Torrances settle in at the Overlook, Danny sees frightening ghosts and visions. Although Danny is close to his parents, he does not tell either of them about his visions because he senses that the care-taking job is important to his father and the family's future. Wendy considers leaving Jack at the Overlook to finish the job on his own; Danny refuses, thinking his father will be happier if they stay.

stephenking,2q12pi,posermcgeee88,11,Mon Dec 22 02:37:42 2014 UTC,"Well, Stan definitely had a much stronger grasp of what was actually happening, as adults and as children. What the existence of a supernatural, malevolent force like It actually had for reality. I'm guessing that's why he killed himself.   See: http://i.imgur.com/FZf5v5S.png"
stephenking,2q12pi,thecarbine,10,Mon Dec 22 07:42:29 2014 UTC,"Easily the best passage in the book, IMO. Hell, one of King's best writing moments period.  EDIT: I also love the reference to The Dark Tower thrown in there."
stephenking,2q12pi,ModRod,5,Mon Dec 22 15:04:17 2014 UTC,"Totally forgot about this passage, which happens a lot for me when reading such a large book! But I think that is definitely a reason for his suicide.   I also remember a part saying how Stan was an ordered person and could stand being scared but he hated being dirty. ""Stay alive and get dirty or die clean."" This ties in with your passage and I think drives home his cause for suicide.   One other thing I was thinking about was the way he committed suicide was kind of symbolic. Stan was the one who cut everyones palms when they completed the circle and made their oath. When Stan was finally confronted with having to answer that oath he could not take it and had to drain the blood used to make that oath. I see it almost as shredding an important contract, therefor voiding its integrity. He had to rid his body of the blood of his fellow losers, and the blood he used to make the oath that he could not stand to fulfill."
stephenking,2q12pi,SDBred619,3,Tue Dec 23 02:05:00 2014 UTC,Dude...also my favorite passage in the book and Ive posted about it a number of times here and on /r/books. Very lovecraftian.
stephenking,2q12pi,ElwoodBlatch,6,Sat Dec 27 22:44:59 2014 UTC,"I think these are good questions... I am not sure but maybe Mike wasn't involved because he stayed in Derry and remembered everything. As far as Eddie being killed, he had to kill at least one of them, and to me that seems like the best fit. I just want to know what happened to Eddies poor wife."
stephenking,2q12pi,ElwoodBlatch,4,Mon Dec 22 07:23:33 2014 UTC,"I kept thinking the same thing about Eddies wife. The way she acted when he left was actually very sad and made me feel really bad for her. I could only imagine she was worried sick the whole time and did not find out what happened to him, only that he went missing. But also I think his wife is suppose to parallel his mother, who we aren't supposed to like since she is so toxic to Eddie, so I guess we shouldn't feel too bad."
stephenking,2q12pi,Damien__,1 point,Tue Dec 23 02:10:48 2014 UTC,Yea and she got off easy compared to many other King characters :)
stephenking,2q12pi,ElwoodBlatch,7,Tue Dec 23 06:41:14 2014 UTC,"King had old Stan die at the beginning for narrative hook and had Mike get injured to make 5 as he says in the book '5 is a number of power not as powerful as 7 but still powerful' both are prime numbers as well. 6 is nothing special really As to why it was Mike that stayed out I can only guess that because Mike stayed in Derry and had as an adult already been down there once, to retrieve the silver slugs, Mike was the logical one to leave behind  Why he chose to kill off Eddie I don't really have a theory. I can guess why it wasn't certain members.... Bill had Audra to care for and Ben and Bev were going to be together. That left Eddie, Ritchie and Mike who could have been killed. In the hospital in Mikes case. If we assume King wanted to have IT actually kill one of them in the tunnels that would exclude Mike"

The two years in the book are 58 and 85.   8 is the symbol used for infinity, maybe to symbolize IT's ""eternal"" life.  5 is the number of people left in the losers club at the end  Could be a little far fetched but still thought it was something to think about"

stephenking,2q12pi,frankdiabetes,4,Mon Dec 22 14:42:10 2014 UTC,"Is that the legit reason? I just though it was because to kids ""sex is for adults and IT doesn't kill adults."" Pretty flawless kid logic."

The ""why"" isn't really important except for the fact that they believed it would work. Their childlike faith was necessary for them to defeat IT.  Also, in the context of the novel itself, IT came out in 1986, and since then we've seen a shift in how society perceives sexuality involving children. While that scene was meant to be shocking, I don't think it would have set off the same ""pedo"" alarm bells that it does currently."

stephenking,2pyl6b,carlos22ihs,8,Sun Dec 21 08:37:43 2014 UTC,"I think 11/22/63 is the best book King has published in recent years (it's about the assassination of JFK). There was also a book of 4 novellas called 'Full Dark No Stars' a year or so before that which I think is excellent (though quite dark) 2 of the stories have also recently been adapted into films. His most recent novel 'Revival' is good too and I think has a more early King feel to it.  For you just starting out I'd recommend one of the classic early King novels. My personal favourites are It (though it's over a 1000 pages so quite a heavy one to start on!), Pet Sematary, The Shining and The Stand (another 1000 pager).  Although what I did when I was starting out was quite similar to your friend. I went to charity shops and picked up whichever book appealed to me the most. I've got just about all his books now and I've only got the most recently published books brand new.  Hope this helps!"

I just thought of another good one too (from a year or so ago) and that's Joyland.  It's more of a crime novel and is set in an old theme park. It's quite short but I loved it and I think it's some of his best writing.

stephenking,2pvhi0,city17_dweller,11,Tue Dec 30 05:31:50 2014 UTC,"She might like 'The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon' ... sounds like she's only a bit older than the main character, so she'll identify well.  There's no overt sex stuff, it's a lost-in-the-woods tale with a supernatural tension.  It's also one of King's shorter books, which makes it a good introduction for a younger reader."
stephenking,2pvhi0,docwilson,0,Sat Dec 20 11:30:49 2014 UTC,I thought about it but she has a higher reading level than her age would indicate so I thought that would be not enough book for her.

From the email i got on the 12th:  You’re receiving this message because you preordered our special edition of CARRIE by Stephen King.  The Gift Edition and Numbered Artist Edition will arrive in our warehouse late next week, so we’d like to confirm your shipping address we have on file for this order one last time.  Please note: you will receive a shipping confirmation email when your order ships.  It may take us up to three weeks to ship all of the orders for these two editions."
stephenking,2ph7hg,JLSaun,1 point,Tue Dec 16 16:18:38 2014 UTC,The only one I could preorder was the Special Deluxe copy. Is that the same as the Gift Edition? Only reason I ask is because I heard about King doing his first six books like this but I didn't know the release was so close. I figured that this was starting early next year.   Was there some sort of special pre-order for a superior copy before the Special Deluxe?
stephenking,2ph7hg,JLSaun,1 point,Tue Dec 16 17:15:46 2014 UTC,"Yes, the one you ordered is titled as the Deluxe Slipcased Gift Edition.  I just went back and looked and I ordered mine in late October and the gift edition was the only one available then too.  Not sure when this one went on sale.  I want to say the are coming out every six months, so keep your eyes peeled for the next one, thought I can't recall where I heard the 6 months thing."
stephenking,2ph7hg,chillbill69,1 point,Tue Dec 16 21:34:44 2014 UTC,I ordered back in April (when they first announced it). There was also a Numbered edition (to 750) signed by the artist that sold for $225 and a Lettered edition (to 52) signed by the artist that sold for $1000. Both of those sold out within like an hour after being announced.  The whole 6 month thing is on the home page of Cemetery Dance. I believe that Salem's Lot will be put up for sale around the first of the year and be published sometime around July (six months from January).

stephenking,2p95h6,MathNerd31,2,Sun Dec 14 12:10:29 2014 UTC,"It's a book to read later in the King library.  It alludes to so many other works, which is one of the things that makes it special.  There's a lot of King that has a common theme, or takes place in the Gunslinger universe, but ""Needful Things"" mentions places and people by name, or at least that was what I remember about it. I think I'll read the ""Dark Half"" over again, then this.  They were both great.    I'm reading ""The Dome"" again.  I'm realizing, one of my favorite parts about it is it doesn't go over the same Gunslinger stuff over and over."

stephenking,2p7y3d,Prin_StropInAh,4,Sun Dec 14 01:37:14 2014 UTC,I read IT when I was in middle school. I have such a special connection to that book because of when I read it. It also was the biggest book I'd read to date and I was super proud of it - I'm not a very good reader and it's hard for me to sit down and really power through a long book.
stephenking,2p7y3d,mangarooboo,2,Sun Dec 14 07:59:28 2014 UTC,"Both. But ""It"" first."
stephenking,2p7y3d,capt_make_it_happen,2,Sun Dec 14 02:55:16 2014 UTC,Length-The shining. A lot shorter Content-IMO IT.
stephenking,2p7y3d,BillyTalentfan,2,Sun Dec 14 05:17:59 2014 UTC,IT has scary moments throughout the whole book. The Shining only has a few.
stephenking,2p7y3d,him1087,1 point,Sun Dec 14 05:27:07 2014 UTC,both are relevant to the dark tower.

stephenking,2p7y3d,mangarooboo,1 point,Sun Dec 14 08:01:04 2014 UTC,"I have to say The Shining - I think it's because of the type of scare. IT is outright, The Shining is slow and creeping... it makes you feel penned in and claustrophobic, knowing something is happening, but not knowing what it is or when it will come.  IT was more build build SCARE, where The Shining just wove it in seamlessly so it caught you off guard.  I love them both, but The Shining certainly scared me more."

stephenking,2p3il2,fcdftw,12,Fri Dec 12 18:00:11 2014 UTC,I would love to see something like this for every King novel or short story. He really knows how to add a great soundtrack to set the mood of the story.
stephenking,2p3il2,JohnnyRyall76,4,Fri Dec 12 19:32:23 2014 UTC,I had such fun making this one - I plan to do others.  Any suggestions on which book to do next?
stephenking,2p3il2,JohnnyRyall76,9,Fri Dec 12 19:36:02 2014 UTC,The Stand would be my first suggestion. It has plenty of references to songs. I personally would love to see that.

stephenking,2oz2uo,b34t,3,Fri Dec 12 02:30:14 2014 UTC,"Beautiful! One day I will get there as well, I 'm slowly starting my own collection too."
stephenking,2oz2uo,twerkysandwich,2,Thu Dec 11 17:27:20 2014 UTC,"Thanks!  That's how we all got stared - slow & steady wins the race.    I'd say that this is the result of ~15 years of casual collecting (by that I mean buying the 1st trade edition when it was released, reading it, and then putting it on a shelf); and about another 15 years of more serious collecting when I started seeing it as a potential investment as well."
stephenking,2oz2uo,twerkysandwich,2,Thu Dec 11 18:39:56 2014 UTC,Very cool indeed. I love the fact that you have stored them so carefully behind glass.
stephenking,2oz2uo,twerkysandwich,1 point,Fri Dec 12 00:12:18 2014 UTC,"Thanks - it was a gift from my wife, and glass doors were my only real requirement.  Although I need to get some UV protection on the glass - it's very close to a window and I worry that it gets too much direct light."
stephenking,2oz2uo,arsmorendi,2,Fri Dec 12 02:32:01 2014 UTC,Truly a beautiful collection.   Do I spy House of Leaves? Did you manage to finish it? I got perhaps 300 pages into it and was getting skeptical about what returns I might get for my investment.
stephenking,2oz2uo,arsmorendi,1 point,Fri Dec 12 01:28:57 2014 UTC,"Good eye - a signed edition, as a matter of fact.  It's a challenging & sometimes frustrating read - it's worth it to make your way to the end, although I confess that 'Only Revolutions' is right next to it, and I haven't cracked the cover on that one yet."
stephenking,2oz2uo,arsmorendi,2,Fri Dec 12 02:34:27 2014 UTC,"Nice! I remember Daniel because I loved his sister, the musician Poe, in the 90's but House of Leaves was fairly hard to find for a few years. That book stayed in the back of my mind until I got my copy a couple years ago.   I have to ask if you don't mind--what is your approximate age? Even before ebooks, this kind of curation had become somewhat uncommon. I'm 30 and spent my childhood exposed to my parents and grandparents who collected postcards and antiques, but when I was a kid it was all about stockpiling paperbacks to take to the used bookstore to cash in for another armload of books to read. It's a different mentality altogether to collect and preserve as you are doing, and I enjoyed perusing your shelves."
stephenking,2oz2uo,acoustic12stringer,1 point,Fri Dec 12 03:41:21 2014 UTC,"Hey thanks!  I'm in my mid 40s now.  I was the exact same way when I was younger - I can't tell you how many hundreds of paperbacks I've gone through.    But a lot of this collection I can attribute to my reverence to Stephen King's writing - I wanted to read his books the moment they came out, so even as a teenager I would buy the hardcover as soon as I saw it for sale.  Of course as a teenager, buying hardcover books was expensive to me so I was pretty careful to keep them on a shelf & in decent condition.  I kept them with me for many years, but didn't really think of them as a collection until I actually began collecting, if that makes sense  :)  So a bit of luck, a bit of being careful, a bit of anal retentiveness, and here I am!  Of course I kick myself for not getting in on the signed/limited editions until very late in the game (but who doesn't?)"
stephenking,2oz2uo,arsmorendi,3,Fri Dec 12 04:27:52 2014 UTC,"That's really cool--I almost had you pegged for that age. I was torn between keeping my books pristine or engaging in a bent spine or a coffee stain on a paperback. I enjoyed the feeling of both, the latter perhaps a rebellion to the former.   I'm jealous of how well your method worked for you! So congrats. :) I lost my house and everything in it three years ago in a windstorm (outside of a tornado) with flooding so I can console myself that I lost nothing I truly cared about, but I still get the itch to collect books that I love. I guess I'll keep reading on Kindle and through Audible as it suits me, but I would love to have a collection like yours someday."
stephenking,2ozfgd,rph80,3,Thu Dec 11 16:27:51 2014 UTC,"I didn't read too much into it.  Just because somebody has visions, it does not mean they fully understand what they are.  They may not be making a deliberate choice to embrace that world, only trying to escape their own hellish existence.  They may not realize that the Ant things are literally waiting for them in death, or their personal variation is real.  The main character saw them, but didn't realize the significance until the end.  I didn't see much of a story justification for it, other than to highlight the costs of what he was offering them.  Best King book in a very long time!"
stephenking,2ozfgd,mikemonk2004,2,Thu Dec 11 23:24:18 2014 UTC,"I'm just guessing here, but I think that even if it wasn't a conscious experience, some part of their mind has been affected/tainted by Mother's world. I think only Mary, being dead, could actually link the two worlds for more than an instant. But whatever tiny flash of the afterworld the others did get while in that weird blackout/fugue state, after the shock, was enough to drive some of them insane. It seemed like even though they had no conscious understanding of what they had seen, there was obviously some part of their mind that connects to Mother's world (as when Astrid starts talking about it while unconscious after the ""cure"", and then forgets when she wakes up). I guess, as with other traumatic experiences, some minds are stronger (or maybe they're just less ""susceptible"" to supernatural stuff) and those people were more OK--until the end of the book. As for why secret electricity = link to the afterlife, I'm not sure about that."
stephenking,2ozfgd,lennonfan11,2,Thu Dec 11 21:41:23 2014 UTC,"I think that Jacobs revived 'It', from the novel ""It"" when he ""opened the door"". Maybe that is crazy, but that is what it seemed like to me. Mother is It. He calls mother It at one point ""It was mother."" pg381. Its power is manifesting whatever you are scared of, what you fear most, what is Jacobs afraid of, that his wife and child are in hell. Now that It has been revived, It is hungry and has consumed all those who have killed themselves and others that were once cured by the secret electricty. It, the multi-dimensional being who feeds of fear and agony, has been revived and seeking revenge on the earth! That is my crazy theory."
stephenking,2ozfgd,JoeVictoria,2,Fri Dec 12 05:30:21 2014 UTC,"I don't think it's that crazy. I think if it's not IT, it's a similar being. We know they both have spider-like bodies. And we also know it's from the same world as IT, because Dorrance Marstellar is mentioned, the character from Insomnia (and Derry resident)."

stephenking,2oyahe,Deweyrob2,2,Thu Dec 11 09:16:32 2014 UTC,Probably   something to think about... I just finished that portion of DT and there is a point that Eddie says the projected 7-8 hour trip sure went by fast and Blaine responds with something like 'Time passes differently around these parts'  IMHO the Topeka of W&G is not the same world as depicted in The Stand it is one very similar but one where Flagg won the battle
stephenking,2oyahe,Damien__,2,Thu Dec 11 16:24:34 2014 UTC,I've read The Stand and I just finished W&G. I'm 99% sure it's to do with the thinny.
stephenking,2oyahe,LozziWithALongO,1 point,Thu Dec 11 07:38:30 2014 UTC,"I'm guessing that the thinny either allowed them to cross into the Topeka from The Stand, or Captain Trips made it's way through the thinny to Mid-world's Topeka."
stephenking,2oyahe,barryabrams,5,Thu Dec 11 15:56:50 2014 UTC,"I thought it was confirmed that it wasn't the Topeka, KS from The Stand, but one of many other worlds where Captain Trips ravaged the country. It's more of an alternate Topeka to the universe in The Stand.  Is this a correct assumption? I don't remember any Noza-la or Takuro Spirits in The Stand."
stephenking,2oyahe,ModRod,1 point,Thu Dec 11 17:28:53 2014 UTC,"When I first read it, I assumed there was a Topeka, Mid-World, that had always been on Blaine's route-map but now happened to have a thinny in it, resulting in arrival at Topeka, whatever-world-The-Stand-takes-place-in.  But now I'm questioning my assumption.  Maybe Blaine knew from monitoring the tracks that there was a new thinny, and where it was directed and added it to the map?"

stephenking,2ox8s2,grillo7,5,Thu Dec 11 05:05:26 2014 UTC,Absolutely this. It would be a great book to read straight after reading IT. Much more of a grown up tale. I would also highly recommend The Stand.

stephenking,2ox8s2,RobertPaulsen39,3,Thu Dec 11 03:58:12 2014 UTC,"I know. Read Misery. It's built around only a few characters, in really possible situations, and no kids. So you will find the dialogue rings more true.   Did you see the movie? Hopefully not so the book will be full of surprises.   Honestly, I would avoid the Dark Tower at this point, since it's a multi-book commitment and you still aren't sure if King is for you."
stephenking,2ox8s2,glibrar,1 point,Thu Dec 11 07:06:39 2014 UTC,Thanks! I did see the movie but probably in the early '90s so I don't remember anything aside from the 'famous scene'.
stephenking,2ox8s2,brencameron,1 point,Fri Dec 12 01:00:09 2014 UTC,Misery is worth reading even if you have seen the movie. There's an entire theme about writers and what they write that was left out of the movie (probably due to time constraints).
stephenking,2ox8s2,sixstringer420,2,Tue Dec 16 16:16:45 2014 UTC,"Huge King fan here. I see what you mean about It. I love the story, think it's great, but the dialogue was ... off. Hard to write ten year olds doing really adult stuff, and try to capture the adults responding to the stresses of the kids they were.   Saying that, I think It stands out in that failing, along with The Talisman (another great book, but the main character is young). His early writings lack the depth of his later work, but are worth the read for the rawness of them.   Recommendations? Try some of the short story collections. They're quicker, less depth and character development, and equally good. If you like those, expand! There's so much to like. And, because I almost have to, try the Gunslinger. Unlike his other work, but tied to almost everything that he's done before.  Personal favs: Tommyknockers - An unexpected find in the woods leads to unexpected results. A little more grown up of a story. Needful Things - A new shop opens up in a small town, and sells exactly what you want, but can you afford it? Misery - A big time writer meets small town crazy. Insomnia - An old man can't sleep, and starts seeing things that may or may not be real. The Stand - An epidemic leads to a spiritual good v evil finale. (Bit cheesy at the end, but the journey is worth it.)"
stephenking,2ox8s2,The_Demon_Barber,2,Thu Dec 11 02:23:20 2014 UTC,Awesome. Thanks for such a sincere response.
stephenking,2ox8s2,The_Demon_Barber,1 point,Thu Dec 11 03:00:40 2014 UTC,"If you want more supernatural, try maybe 'Salem's Lot or Pet Sematary. If you're willing to move away from fantasy/ unrealistic type things, though, I highly suggest Different Seasons, which contains four novellas including Shawshank Redemption and The Body, which is what the movie Stand By Me was based on. Actually, read Different Seasons either way. Most of it isn't classic King, but it's still a very worthy read."

I'm not a religious man, but I can understand now how people of that persuasion can be satisfied by living for their faith.

Tommyknockers is a good book if you've ever wondered, ""What is Stephen King's writing like... on cocaine"""

I loved every page of that book and it's still one of my favorites. Lisey's story, while good at times, never really wowed me like TK did. But much depends on your preferences- if you enjoy character driven stories that are mostly about relationships, you might agree with the majority here. If, like me, you love a good, fast paced sci-fi yarn, you might enjoy TK as much as I did. But you really can't go wrong with either."

They all make you think in their own ways, and when added up together, they are truly terrifying sometimes.  That being said, I REALLY love ""The Road Virus Travels North"".

stephenking,2ojw59,Berjiwhir,3,Sun Dec 7 15:05:40 2014 UTC,Thank you! I'm actually a first-time reader of the DT series. May I ask why you think reading the seven core novels first would be better?
stephenking,2ojw59,TjPshine,7,Sun Dec 7 15:13:37 2014 UTC,"Probably just because this list will take a long time to read, and I know I always start to forget about characters and events if I haven't read things in a while.       When a new book in a series comes out I always have to reread the series.       Also Wind in the Keyhole, I haven't read it,  But I assume it has some spoilers"
stephenking,2ojw59,RobertPaulsen39,2,Sun Dec 7 15:20:20 2014 UTC,"The wind in the keyhole doesn't really have spoilers, and it fits well in between books 4 and 5 if I remember correctly."
stephenking,2ojw59,Berjiwhir,4,Sun Dec 7 15:53:22 2014 UTC,"The problem with TWttK is that it's a flashback right after the super-long flashback in book 4. It takes a long time for the ka-tet to get moving again if read in that order and it feels a little tedious. This is how I read it earlier this year, books 1-4 for the second time, TWttK for the first time, books 5-6 for the second time, and book 7 for the first time."
stephenking,2ojw59,Yamchu,2,Sun Dec 7 17:17:45 2014 UTC,"The Tower does touch on other King stuff. While that is cool, those connections are not essential for enjoying the core series. The core seven books are good enough that I think it's worth it to follow the primary story to the end and then go back and read the books that link to it afterward."
stephenking,2ojw59,Berjiwhir,2,Sun Dec 7 19:06:22 2014 UTC,The Wind Through The Keyhole   doesn't it go after wolves?
stephenking,2ojw59,BasketeerOverHere,3,Sun Dec 7 18:24:16 2014 UTC,"Technically it falls between Wizard and Wolves. But the narrator makes vague references to things that happen in the last three books. Plus, while cool enough, The Wind Through the Keyhole is totally nonessential. You can read it later and not miss anything."
stephenking,2ojw59,crashdemon,3,Sun Dec 7 19:04:10 2014 UTC,"I just thought I'd point out you put Rose Madder after book 3 as well as book 4. I don't know if this is on purpose, in case you're saying we're supposed to read it twice, but I thought I'd bring that to your attention just in case."
stephenking,2ojw59,ElectricTurtlez,1 point,Sun Dec 7 17:13:35 2014 UTC,"Thanks for telling me about that, I fixed the list."
stephenking,2ojw59,topher2012,2,Sun Dec 7 17:37:16 2014 UTC,I agree that your first read through you should read the core books and then go back and revisit. It will take a long time getting through everything and you will have a better grasp on the whole dt universe. You will not lose out by missing back stories/side stories and it is fun to read and pick up the easter eggs later. Long days and pleasent nights fellow traveler.

stephenking,2ofgea,agentlemidget,9,Mon Dec 8 18:37:54 2014 UTC,"Sometimes I swear I'm the only person who feels this way, but I HATE the first book. I think it's pretentious and obviously written by a kid. But everything else is SO WORTH IT. The Gunslinger might clear up a few references later in the series you might not get if you don't read it, but as far as I'm concerned, the only important thing that happens in that book is Roland meets Jake, a boy who died and passed from our world to Roland's, then Roland totally lets him drop down a chasm and die again because magical quest.   Again, this is just, like, my opinion, man, and it seems like you've already read it anyway, but I personally got hooked by the second book, and it is nothing like the first in tone. Eddie Dean is one of my favorite characters from anything ever, and I'm glad I stuck around long enough to read about him."
stephenking,2ofgea,dopshoppe,4,Sat Dec 6 03:29:06 2014 UTC,"When King wrote that, it was just a young author's attempt at the beginning of an arty epic.  From the beginning of the second book, it became, with hindsight, an introduction to Roland - characterless on the surface, but with a deeper buried romance.  Arid and strange.  And, yeah, weighty on the prose.  As soon as he meets his companion characters, and King gives him wider context, the series takes off.  Dialogue helps... Roland finding our world helps more; the first book is important, but does not define the feels of the series.  Seriously, stick with it."
stephenking,2ofgea,city17_dweller,5,Sat Dec 6 04:25:23 2014 UTC,"Oh shit!! Guess what, dude!!?? The first book is slow as a motherfucker and king was trying sooooo hard that it can be a little much, however... Please read The Drawing of the Three!! It is a gigantic change of pace and attitude, I promise!! If you don't like TDOT3, then fine - drop the tower..

I don't know if that means anyone who has had the secret electricity zapped into their noggin is also a key or somehow Jamie was special.  To be honest, I read the book in one day which means I likely missed any small details that were meant to be clues or keys.    That said, this is one story that I hope doesn't get revisited.  The ending was so bleak and terrifying that I don't want more, I'm completely satisfied with not opening that door further."
stephenking,2ofghn,ughalready,2,Mon Dec 8 17:48:12 2014 UTC,"I  hope he leaves it as it is to an extent, the book was such a good character piece (specifically about Jamie and Charlie) and it was fun being able to follow their lives (in Charlie's case off an on over decades) and to see how they grew as people. The ending was phenomenal and unsettling as all hell; it left me thinking about it for weeks and weeks after, in fact I'm probably going to reread it tonight.  At the same time I'm really interested in what Mother has planned for Jamie, it could go into a full on post-apocalyptic destruction tale that would, potentially, be chilling and deeply unsettling."

Revival, I felt, was a strong novel/story/concept, and proves that King still has that spark (no pun intended) in him, that allows him to do what he does best, spin tales that excite and (sometimes) amaze."
stephenking,2ofghn,finkgraphics,1 point,Sat Dec 6 04:22:26 2014 UTC,Felt the same way.  I had read The Mountains Of Madness within the past 2 years and this book has so many similarities. Everything from the narration style to the ancient beings. It was a great ride.

stephenking,2ofghn,IndigoHarlequin,3,Mon Dec 8 21:00:11 2014 UTC,"I loved it. It was King at his best - pure 80s horror. The last chapters would have fit perfectly in one of his short collections like Skeleton Crew.  I hope he doesn't write a sequel. For once, a King book actually ended at the right time, with the right tone. Anything more would either diminish the impact or take it too far into farce."
stephenking,2ofghn,EnIdiot,5,Wed Dec 10 05:41:52 2014 UTC,"I liked how he wrote a Lovecraft-esque novel that actually included dialog, human interest, and words used in the last two centuries. Seriously, though, I thought it was a very good book. He really made you feel for all characters."
stephenking,2ofghn,TheRealXLegend,1 point,Sun Dec 7 00:34:06 2014 UTC,"i disliked the lack of horror most of the time, but then found myself rather satisfied when it hit in a whole just as the novel ends, i especially ""liked"" the highly figurative horror (netherworld, suicides) and i therefore look forward to a sequel of sorts. i guess my dislike came from a certain carelessness for secondary characters i developed as the novel spans ~5 decades, so i didnt really care about jamies family at all. jacobs family's death however hit me hard, probably because at that time the novel focused on one time period extensively. i hope you understand me, english is not my mother language and my opinion on this is hard to explain :D"
stephenking,2ofghn,JitteryPenguin,2,Mon Dec 8 21:39:28 2014 UTC,"While I agree with you about not feeling anything for Jamie's family for the most part, I really thought he did an excellent job of making you feel for Claire.

stephenking,2oddp5,bamfra,15,Fri Dec 5 15:49:08 2014 UTC,I loved everything about True Detective. I strongly believe Fukunaga will do a great job.  On the other hand we could all argue that the actor that will play Pennywise will have a hard time topping Curry's performance.
stephenking,2oddp5,Spankler,4,Fri Dec 5 17:02:58 2014 UTC,True Detective was a damn finely crafted season of TV and it handled the back and forth time jumps very well. The guy's a damn good writer and director.

Long story short; they collaborated closely on the first few pages, and then would alternate sections. One would write a bunch of pages and then mail it to the other who would pick the story up from the last sentence and continue on for a bunch of pages.

His whole ""now we are floating down a road, we've met thus guy before, he's  it important now, but he will be later, let's now float over to this place and watch this thing"", just terrible.  I absolutely loved the story, if they do a 3rd book perhaps they can write the story together and just let king write the actual book."
stephenking,2oaz9i,GaijinSama,3,Fri Dec 5 12:00:18 2014 UTC,"Yeah, but you can't be sure Straub wrote that. They both tried to emulate each other's style for some of the chapters.  I suggest you read Floating Dragon or Ghost Story. I hated Straub for a long time, because I found a lot of Talisman boring, and being a King fan I just assumed the bits I didn't like were written by Straub. But now I love him. Once I read one of his books, it changed everything. He's actually very good."
stephenking,2oaz9i,JohnLocke815,3,Fri Dec 5 14:39:25 2014 UTC,"I've read every king book,  aside from desperation and regulators (which I'm starting Monday now that I finished revival) abs king has never written that way.  So it was either Straub or king emulating straubs style. Either way,  I didn't like it."
stephenking,2oaz9i,GaijinSama,3,Fri Dec 5 15:36:22 2014 UTC,"My contention still stands. Give him a shot. His writing style isn't like Talisman or Black House either, really. Any Stephen King fan should at least read one Straub book."
stephenking,2oaz9i,JohnLocke815,1 point,Sat Dec 6 05:41:58 2014 UTC,Which would you recommend?  Maybe I'll give it a go once I finish my last 2 kings
stephenking,2oaz9i,JohnLocke815,2,Sat Dec 6 12:19:35 2014 UTC,"I really liked Ghost Story, which is the book that got me into Straub. But it's one major flaw is that it's central mystery involves some very prudish sexual attitudes(which is not something you can normally say about Peter Straub).  Floating Dragon is probably his most balls-to-the-wall horror book. He took a break from horror for awhile, and wanted to go out with a bang. Mr. X mixes his two favorite themes; supernatural horror and mysteries buried in a small town past. You could also check out some of his shorter fiction. Seven Tales is probably the more horror-oriented of his short fiction.  The thing about Peter Straub is that I feel like his themes and story interests are remarkably similar to Stephen King. But where Stephen King is a blue-collar man of the people, who loves AC/DC and cheeseburgers, Straub is the upper-middle-class guy who loves jazz and wine with a good meal. The stories are similar, but the trappings are different."

stephenking,2oatsp,docfunbags,2,Fri Dec 5 00:34:20 2014 UTC,I read this book in the late 80s as a young teen. And I imagined what an awesome movie this would make. I was ecstatic to find out in the early 90s that Spielberg was attached. Only to have my hopes dashed routinely over the past 20ish years.   It is still a timeless story and is a huge fit for Amblin.

I actually wasn't as big a fan of Steven Weber's narration of IT - for me, it felt like he was 'acting' it too much (just a personal opinion, I still really like him as an actor). But I still found it better than David Morse's narration of Revival. Far too droll and one-note. Right now I'm mid-way through The Stand, narrated by Grover Gardner and I think he's fantastic.   Edit: Almost forgot Craig Wasson's narration of 11/22/63. Very poignant and well done."

The story is pretty linear, there isn't any need for special effects, and nothing seems to complex. Thing of adaptations like It or The Shining, with some pretty-far out sequences. They were filmed no problem. It's also one of King's slimmer books, which means screenwriters wouldn't need to cut much, which would be nice."

stephenking,2obiic,bellmanator,2,Fri Dec 5 01:51:44 2014 UTC,"I think what makes the story so terrifying is that Pennywise (or IT, Bob Gray, whichever name you prefer) feeds off of fear. He figures out his victims biggest fears and then takes that form.   Also, the story (at least half of it) is told from the perspective of children, who are more susceptible to fear. And a great deal of the ""scariness"" comes from the enigmatic quality of the antagonist, the way that he just randomly pops up for a minute or two, when they are most secluded and vulnerable, and then disappears, leaving the characters and you, the reader, wondering: What is IT?

I thought it was trite and completely ridiculous, the way some of the characters behaved was beyond belief. I just couldn't handle it at all. I finished it, but I did not enjoy it much. I feel the same way about Mr. Mercedes, though I loved almost every other King book I've read, which is around 40 of them."

However, I strongly agree with you on Mr. Mercedes.  When I finished it, my first thought was that it could have been a generic episode of CSI or Criminal Minds.  It just seemed very cliched and ordinary."

stephenking,2o76cd,agorby00,3,Thu Dec 4 18:20:43 2014 UTC,"Honestly I thought the Danny/alcoholism parts were the best parts of it. If Stephen had made that its own thing, made Danny an original character instead of a grown-up Danny, left out the Shining callback, and done something much more creepy/menacing with the antagonist, it would have been really good.  Most of my problem with it was that the villains seemed tacked-on and weren't frightening/challenging at all. It turned into just a dude beating up on a bunch of old people."
stephenking,2o76cd,AuthorSAHunt,1 point,Thu Dec 4 18:26:52 2014 UTC,"Really good points, all of them.  Maybe that's why I couldn't put my finger on. He should have just let it be a stand alone story instead of crushing my memories of The Shining."
stephenking,2o76cd,agorby00,2,Thu Dec 4 18:29:54 2014 UTC,"I don't think he went far enough with the True Knot. They weren't antagonistic enough--they were just xenophobic survivalists. You could replace them with the cast of The Walking Dead and outside the fact that Rick and Daryl would have made mincemeat of Danny and his friends, there probably wouldn't be much of a difference in the True Knot's interior dynamic, if at all.  They were almost good guys, if not for the feisty-mean personality of their leader. When they started panicking about steam, I almost felt bad for them. He could have gone a lot darker/uglier with them."

stephenking,2o76cd,mikemonk2004,3,Thu Dec 4 04:22:45 2014 UTC,I think From a Buick 8 is best in audio form. It feels so much like sitting on a porch and listening to a crazy story an old guy thought up. It's one of my favorites.

stephenking,2o6wgn,1ou1,3,Thu Dec 4 01:53:11 2014 UTC,"This was a much different book than most of King's works.  I thought I knew where it was going initially, and it radically changed. Then I thought I finally had a handle on it, before he veered way off again.    You have to finish the book.  Normally King is great a building up a story only to have a weaker ending.  This book is the exact opposite.  I thought most of the story was just ok, but, damn, that ending.    Outside of the Mist, I cannot think of a better ending for a King story. It completely transforms the book from just being so-so, to being outstanding.   Edit:  I also loved the Lovecraftian imagery.  I have never read Lovecraft, but enjoyed reading the references to him in Wikipedia while reading Revival.  Makes me really want to check out Lovecraft now."
stephenking,2o6wgn,mikemonk2004,1 point,Thu Dec 4 04:17:15 2014 UTC,"Completely agree; even many of his best novels suffer from being terrific journeys but with terrible endings.

stephenking,2o7yk4,RobertPaulsen39,3,Thu Dec 4 03:02:15 2014 UTC,"Jack has two things going against him. First, he has a large amount of Shining himself though not as much as Danny or his granddaughter Abra. Unlike Danny (who has had Dick), he has nobody to guide him in what the Shining opens you up to. He's susceptible to being manipulated by sprits and by entities like the Overlook. Secondly, he is an alcoholic and has anger problems as a child survivor of physical abuse himself. Under it all, however, he loves his son and his wife. I don't want to spoil anything here, but in order to understand Jack, you have to read Dr. Sleep. I came to realize that Jack's problems are really deep-seated in his genetics. His nature lead him to make some very poor choices, and while he has to accept responsibility for his actions, he also redeems himself with his actions by blowing up the Overlook ."
stephenking,2o7yk4,EnIdiot,1 point,Thu Dec 4 12:51:05 2014 UTC,How does he fight back against the overlook?
stephenking,2o7yk4,EnIdiot,2,Thu Dec 4 14:51:40 2014 UTC,"I don't want to spoil anything, but at the end he finds the strength to overcome the possession by the Overlook and save his family. I hate drawing parallels with Stephen King's life, but he has admitted that the Shining has a lot of autobiographical details about his own struggles with alcoholism. Additionally, his biggest beef with the Movie by Kubrick was the way in which Jack was simply portrayed as an irredeemably bat-shit crazy man. I'm of the opinion that he fought back by the grace what King would later describe as the ""Gan"" or the ""White,"" his definition of the sum total all that is good. It isn't quite the same as God, but it is pretty damn close."
stephenking,2o7yk4,Charlinski,2,Thu Dec 4 15:51:43 2014 UTC,"I think Dr. Sleep is still very fresh in your head, The beginning states a lot of the things that happened in the years leading up to where Danny is in Dr. Sleep. Such as the lockboxes, Ms. Massey and Horace Derwent showing up again. It also mentions that the people who owned the Overlook paid the Torrance's a settlement because Jack gave his life to try and stop the hotel from blowing sky high, but thats obviously the top layer, how it seemed to everyone who wasn't there when it happened, and I doubt Wendy wanted to discredit his ""honorable attempt"". In The Shining the last time the real Jack Torrance does anything is when he is face to face with Danny in the dead end hallway and Danny tells him to ""go away"". This get through to Jack and he tells Danny to run and never forget how much he loves him (ad libbing here), then the caretaker/manager takes hold again and destroys the last of Jack Torrance with the mallet. A short time later Danny remembers ""that which was forgotten"" ( the boiler creeps ) and mentions it to the caretaker/manager, who goes crazy and rushes to the boiler room to try and stop the inevitable. Sad to say but Jack is gone at this point, physically at least.  I agree 100% that his shining and lack of a teacher on the matter moulded who he was his drinking problem was most likely to suppress his shine without even knowing, just like Danny would later do, and I'm sure when Danny asked Dick if his dad could shine he says ""he has something"" not even able to notice the shine its that repressed. All in all you could  say that Jack is his own worst enemy, yes. But he also doesn't have many allies, Al Shockley sure wasn't a great friend, despite landing him a job at the Overlook, but look how that turned out."

stephenking,2o50rb,teneno,1 point,Wed Dec 3 14:03:21 2014 UTC,I think King said one time that Cujo was a near perfect adaptation.

stephenking,2o1t7p,AManSoNice,4,Tue Dec 2 15:06:27 2014 UTC,11/22/63 is non-horror and absolutely fantastic.

stephenking,2o04qs,Aktulu,5,Tue Dec 2 02:08:53 2014 UTC,might i suggest the talisman/blackhouse saga next.
stephenking,2o04qs,RadamWilson,2,Tue Dec 2 04:06:34 2014 UTC,The talisman is the collaboration between him and Peter Straub right? How are they? I haven't read any reviews on them.
stephenking,2o04qs,city17_dweller,3,Tue Dec 2 04:25:57 2014 UTC,"The Talisman is fantastic.  A bit slow to start, because the main character is kicking around a near-deserted seaside resort with a sense of impending doom hanging over him, and the authors really work that for a while, but then ... man ... does it ever take off.  Black House doesn't feel the same, but is a good book in its own right.  It's connected to the Dark Tower books, while The Talisman isn't (directly)."
stephenking,2o04qs,illnastee,3,Tue Dec 2 09:06:42 2014 UTC,nice collection. why do you have two copies of FF8?
stephenking,2o04qs,Yamchu,2,Tue Dec 2 03:22:29 2014 UTC,"Well cause one is scratched, the original black one and had to get another one, the greatest hits.  I don't have any bookends so I used my ps1 games. I dont have anymore room on my shelf so I put my books on top."

stephenking,2nzjrp,butter_wizard,3,Mon Dec 1 23:01:10 2014 UTC,Many fans may be aware of his contributions to King's bibliography. Very sad news - I only spoke to him recently.
