footballmanagergames,3e33t9,trebor04,7,Tue Jul 21 19:05:51 2015 UTC,Easily the best bit is that they don't have a full team and only 2 players are even worth looking at. http://i.imgur.com/0aWntMI.png http://i.imgur.com/mTuuFtp.png http://i.imgur.com/J1TaGOk.png

Five of my starting 11 have come through the youth academy and so all of my transfer money over the past three years has gone on the wages of three world class players who are holding the team together while the young players come through.  In a couple of years I could have a reasonable first team made entirely of Boreham Wood academy graduates.

Arsenal have been poor lately, and trying to get back into the top 4 by spending half of their transfer budget on a player that makes 1 senior appearance all season probably isn't going to make for a successful strategy.

But yeah, I didn't plan the team to get all these typical FM players. There were opportunities I had to take, Ödegaard didn't play much at real, Ruben Neves was the only player at the time who was an improvement for my DM and willing to join, Cerri came because I needed a new striker and I wanted to have a different option (only had small, fast players at this time, no classic target man), Ould-Chikh was unhappy at Bayern and Scuffet, well, I didn't want to change my goalkeeper at all but Sommer wanted to go to Barca and they offered good money. It would've been dumb not to agree to this and then Scuffet simply was the best option. He didn't want an irrational amount of money and had great stats.

footballmanagergames,3e25hp,Stigface,2,Tue Jul 21 11:15:52 2015 UTC,I did this where I put some obscure countries regen rating at max so they would produce better regens and overall I've seen throughout some intakes that the quality of regens have improved and they are spitting out more top class players in comparison to the default numbers.
footballmanagergames,3e25hp,Wallygoblin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:55:16 2015 UTC,"I've tried this with Scotland, giving them really high youth ratings. It guarantees a lot of fantastic youth but they sell for a pittance to teams from other leagues because of the transfer values. Amending that to the same values as England mean the clubs start to generate a good income after a while, although low club and nation reputation mean the players always want to move on even if it means they end up in the U19s elsewhere instead of playing regularly.   Ramping up the reputation helps, but until european coefficients increase over the years you'll still get players desperate to leave for other teams. So you'd need to amend all 3 of these things to properly transform a league into a powerhouse."

footballmanagergames,3e2xak,second_prize,3,Tue Jul 21 15:30:24 2015 UTC,Yes. Aggression seems to be at least one of the determining factors for when players put in a challenge.  When I've fined players previously I've noticed that on some occasions the players aggression stat has gone down.
footballmanagergames,3e2xak,ClandestineMovah,3,Tue Jul 21 16:27:00 2015 UTC,"When I tried it, I had to face a sort of revolt from the other players because they thought that the sanction wasn't fair.

I tend not to fine players for being sent off unless I want to impact their aggression.  You can mostly temper their behavior through the press.    PS: I also think have high technique and anticipation will help temper high aggression/low sportsmanship because the slide tackles will be cleaner but I believe that without evidence.

footballmanagergames,3e2u17,LiquidEnvy,4,Tue Jul 21 15:06:13 2015 UTC,"Considering making a new tactic to deal with them. I've only ever had success running an ""attacking"" and possession based tactic. Anytime I've tried to be a counter attacking team and play more direct (anticipating that I will lose possession battle)   This might be your problem. Keep your current tactic as based of the information you've given it works for most teams. Build another but make it neither attacking, control or counter-attack. Make it standard.  When I'm unsure how I'll fair in the league I'll often start out on standard. It's also worth mentioning that it can be a good way to start the game because things don't go to plan. You could also create three tactics all effectively similar but one built around attacking, standard and counter-attacking respectively.  That way when you adjust the philosophy half way through the match you know the players are familiar with the instruction."

Götze is very good as well (athough he's terrible on that position IRL)  Barbosa is an amazing false 9  Schürrle is not that good as a false nine imo.

footballmanagergames,3e20tg,RyaaanC,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:28:52 2015 UTC,Signed him in my current Stuttgart career for €8m and he's developed into one of the best ball winning midfielders in Europe. Had a shaky second half to his third season after coming back from an ankle injury but returned to be a mainstay after he got a good preseason under his belt.

Success. It didn't take three years though...
footballmanagergames,3e2jif,SirArchieCartwheeler,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:24:48 2015 UTC,Well two levels would be nice but three years for it... Well I might update on what happened. The thing is i just want better facilities because I'm still on the level I was when I started in the liga adelante.

footballmanagergames,3e2a9e,Englishnotgentleman,3,Tue Jul 21 12:11:41 2015 UTC,"You hit it man, rotate. When I play in the Conference I like to sign a lot of non-contract players so (among other reasons) injuries don't stay with me if they're really bad and I don't pay them. If someone's injured, they're not playing, and I'm not paying! It's really a win-win if you ask me.  Sign some players non-contract, give the kids a chance when you can (whatever that means in the conference) and get loans loans loans. Rotation is key.  One last thing, make sure your tactics can account for injuries. Full backs getting injured? Make sure you have an extra CD or two and play a 3-defender formation. Stuff like that can really go a long way in non-league football.  Forgot something: training. In the conference you are probably, what, part-timers? Make sure the training schedule isn't too tough for them. If they're getting injured in the weight room then you know you need to decrease their training."

footballmanagergames,3e2a9e,LiquidEnvy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:12:59 2015 UTC,"You just have to make sure your financials can handle it. If I'm paying a non-contract 150/game and we play an average of once a week, I treat it as paying that player 150/week with the added bonus of being able to terminate their contracts without penalty.  Just watch how often you play non-contracts, and if they're playing well tie them up with a contract!  Just wanted to edit in some things: you won't see the effect of non-contracts on your wage bill, as they're appearance fees, so just treat them like wages. Also, often you can tie up a non-contract player in a contract that pays them less per week after app fees are considered. I guess they just like the safety of a contract."

footballmanagergames,3e1es9,fancyzauerkraut,2,Tue Jul 21 06:02:05 2015 UTC,You could try playing Suarez (as F9 or CF attack) in the Centre and Messi as Trequartista in the Right Forward slot.  At least that's what I would try if I ever decided to try Barca. You could also try playing both Neymar and Messi as Trequartistas with Suarez as F9 or all three as F9s (I've seen a tactic where it works).
footballmanagergames,3e1es9,usus789,3,Tue Jul 21 08:31:24 2015 UTC,"This is how I used them on 4-3-3  Messi on the right : Raudmenter, dribble more, shoot more often  Suarez : false nine, shoot more often  Neymar on the left : IF support  With these 3 setups Messi became the only attacking outlet, making him score and assist a lot. Also this tactic work best when you instruct them to play on a slower tempo. They'll pass the ball around and also dribble a lot."

footballmanagergames,3dzm4f,Livodaz,4,Mon Jul 20 20:47:41 2015 UTC,"Due to licensing issues, normally German players can't be called up to the national team (the team always has fake greyed-out players instead). So, when offering a transfer for a player who is only eligible to the German national team, you can offer their team like 300 million for X international appearances and cut the base fee, and they'll accept."
footballmanagergames,3dzm4f,ebEliminator,2,Mon Jul 20 21:30:22 2015 UTC,Holy crap that's rather broken... I'll have to try that out.

footballmanagergames,3dzm4f,benjaaa9,3,Tue Jul 21 00:41:57 2015 UTC,"The German and Japanese national teams, if you look in the game, don't have the real German and Japanese national players but SI couldn't obtain the licencing rights. As such you have players like Muller, Neuer etc. who never get another international cap. This means you can exploit this by offering them a contract with a low wage, but a huge wage 'after five international appearances'. This seems like a good contract for them as they would expect 5 more international games, but in reality they can't at all. This can also be exploited by offering huge 'after international appearances' as part of the transfer fee."
footballmanagergames,3dzm4f,DorothyJMan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:31:20 2015 UTC,The default inbox game has the German NT locked to human managers meaning you can't manage them & they only call up fake players (You need to get an editor file to correct this along with China & S.Korea)  So you can try to lowball German players on their regular salary instead inserting a clause that would allow them a higher salary after making an international appearance knowing they can never make one
footballmanagergames,3dzm4f,gb2003,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:30:50 2015 UTC,"The German National Team aren't  licensed in the game. If you not use a fake.lnc, the german national team has only fake german players.

footballmanagergames,3dxvtw,ClandestineMovah,5,Mon Jul 20 13:35:48 2015 UTC,Honestly I'll check when I get my monthly updAte on training. I also check my players that are loaned out as well
footballmanagergames,3dxvtw,weakpotatoe,2,Mon Jul 20 13:44:52 2015 UTC,Monthly.  Is there indication that training set by the parent club is followed by the loaning club. If that's the case I would think it might be better to have a more general training regimen since I won't be able to change it whilst they're on loan.
footballmanagergames,3dxvtw,ClandestineMovah,3,Mon Jul 20 13:52:44 2015 UTC,I honeStly wouldn't know. Main reason I check on loaned out players is to see basic attribute change / performance level
footballmanagergames,3dxvtw,weakpotatoe,2,Mon Jul 20 13:59:44 2015 UTC,Players who you loan have training set by the loaned club I'm sure when you loan a player yourself you can set there training.  I believe in checking training every 2/3 months monthly does not give players time to develop
footballmanagergames,3dxvtw,weakpotatoe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:50:08 2015 UTC,Yeah I do it mostly just to see if any players are complaining about their workload / see what's their performance been overall. So it's kinda an overview every month to see their development.

Remember, how long it takes you to finish one season is nobodies business but you're own. I know a lad that can finish a season in an evening whereas if I were working it'd take me four times that amount of time.  There is only one football manager game. Classic is ok and if you enjoy it I'd stick with that but otherwise, if you're going to play the full FM then don't sweat it, just put in an hour or two each evening."

As you begin to get into the game I would start by giving as many responsibilities as you an to your assistant coach until you are more comfortable with how the game works. I would also suggest watching videos on youtube and going on sites like fm scout, passion 4 fm, fm base, etc. as they have a lot of helpful tips for beginners."

Normally gets one long 3-4 month injury every year even when I try to keep his training low and rotate him, take him off early in games where we're winning etc. He always ends up bricked.    These are just league appearances for a player that I either play at ST as a DLF(A) or AML as a IF(A). (I have 4 players natural as ST/AML and right footed, so my tactic makes them rotate with eachother during games to unsettle opposition defence, fuck up the marking and use their different height/pace/strength/passing/ball control strengths to create a more dynamic attack)  http://i.imgur.com/mhdDBdN.png  All competition stats from after he came back from the Southampton loan, he isn't the penalty or free kick taker:    20/21: 37 Apps + 3 Subs = 46 Goals + 6 Assists 21/22: 28 Apps + 4 Subs = 41 Goals + 11 Assists 22/23: 29 Apps + 7 Subs = 38 Goals + 12 Assists 23/24: 33 Apps + 4 Subs = 38 Goals + 10 Assists 24/25: 18 Apps + 1 Sub = 14 Goals + 4 Assists 25/26: 38 Apps + 5 Subs = 24 Goals + 14 Assists Currently 16 May 2027: 30 Apps + 1 Sub = 17 Goals + 5 Assists    He's currently 28. Maybe it's Van Persie in disguise and next season he'll stay fit the full year and take the league by storm.    It's not turned out to be that big of a problem because my other Key Striker/AML currently has 49 goals from 42 games in all competitions and has been clocking 30+ goals in the league the last 3 seasons."

footballmanagergames,3dupkp,pacofrommexico,3,Mon Jul 20 09:18:53 2015 UTC,tbh I think he's amazing for an 40 year old and definitely still very good right back. But calling him world class is very generous. Your assistant manager is probably a bit blinded by good performances. Look at his core stats:  Marking: 20 -- world class Positioning: 20 -- world class Stamina: 15 -- good enough Tackling: 13 Crossing: 13 Dribbling: 9 Pace: 8 Acceleration: 8  I don't think that qualifies as world-class. Still interesting to see him on such a high level at this age. (19 natural fitness is crazy good)
footballmanagergames,3dx4ic,joshuamckay,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:57:18 2015 UTC,"Tbh I think this 3-5-2 can be very powerful if you got the right wingers and is especially good because the AI doesn't really adapt to your specific tactic in FM. But if you play against other human managers it would be pretty easy to counter.  If you utilize a wide 4-2-3-1 with a lot of closing down against it, there are two possible outcomes. Either the 3-5-2 gets reverted to a 5-3-2, because the wingers have to play defense all the time, or the Wingers don't do that and your 3 defenders just get torn to pieces. In my opinion you need to use one of the the central midfielders as a defensive midfieder (anchor man or half back) to counteract the possibility of a 4-2-3-1."
footballmanagergames,3dx4ic,Zhivago92,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:38:29 2015 UTC,"huh I just made a new 3-5-2 tactic to start the season with as my CBs are so OP and I finally want to try a 2 striker formation. Gone for 3-1-4-2 myself with Target Man and False 9 up front, wide midfielders, roaming playmaker and a B2B with an Anchorman sitting behind. The two wide CBs are set to close down more hoping that the anchorman will drop back making almost a back 4 when under pressure."
footballmanagergames,3dx4ic,bashfoc2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:37:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan of that style of 3-5-2.    I would suggest changing your wide midfielders to either Defensive Wingers or using players more suited to the Wing Back (S) role to give real defensive cover on the wings. A 3-5-2 has to exploit the extra numbers in the middle with the wings giving an option, not the primary choice of attack or you may constantly find yourself being doubled up on by both a fullback + winger, or fullback + DM. How they work in the system I'm proposing is to lurk just beyond the halfway line making it easy to recycle possession, draw players towards them to open space ahead of them, as well as cross from deep to the far post for the on-rushing strikers. You don't want them crossing from the by-line as the crosses will be intercepted and the resulting counter attack will ruin you.  This sort of thing seems to be more effective for me: http://i.imgur.com/PzIXB6P.png    The CWB-S should be WB-S, set to run wide, cross from deep and to far post Libero drops deep like your central CB to sweep, but he also runs up into the DM spot to become the base of a midfield diamond. the DLP-D holds position and recycles possession, occasionally trying something long range and splitting. the BWM-D runs around, smashing people up and laying it off to start a move. the AM-S drops deep and breaks up play in addition to collecting the ball from someone else and trying something magical with it. He's a bit like a half-assed version of both the DLP and BWM, with more focus on the spectacular. The pair of DLF-As, drop deep and pass around and take turns to make runs in behind. You could have one DLF-A and DLF-S and have them set to swap position with eachother routinely to change it up.    Just my take on it."

When I did my Nuremberg save (R.I.P.), I heard people talking about Borek Dockal, so I bought him for about £1.5 million in my first Bundesliga season and he was my best performer as I finished 4th and qualified for the Champions League (he's got sentimental value)."

Good central defender. - Danny Hoesen (owned by Groningen, ex-Ajax youth player): great striker  All these players are available for cheap (1 million, 2 max.), and they are young and therefore have lots of developing potential.

footballmanagergames,3duges,-TrollBuster-,4,Mon Jul 20 17:23:10 2015 UTC,"Well I've had exactly two saves I've done anything with, but I've been desperately trying to but Mateo Kovacic in my 15 save. He was already at Arsenal when I took over there in my 14 save and served fantastically for over a decade, was my causing for a long time; and, when he started getting old and truly declined, he graciously accepted a lower amount of playing time without complaint. He's become one of my favourite players IRL as a result even though I don't follow Italian soccer, but unfortunately he's not too keen on coming to a club like Hoffenheim, though I'm sure my reputation is steadily growing so I can keep hoping...

footballmanagergames,3dwwd0,zuluntif,2,Mon Jul 20 07:34:16 2015 UTC,It varies depending on the player and age of the player to be honest normally it is one attribute until I feel the player is well rounded in the attributes needed for his role and position then I train the role

Assisted so many times, couldn't even keep track. Eventually, City took interest, and my policy is to sell even the best players if the money is good enough, so I did. Made just over £55m in profit, and that's the showing off part.  The really sad part is that he couldn't even break into the main squad over at City, despite City finishing 4th last season (versus Swansea in 1st) and currently sitting at 15th with 6 games played. Poor Patrick is now playing with the U21s over at City. God dammit City.  EDIT: Bonus! Gnabry playing a grand total of 5 games for Arsenal after being purchased for £50m."

As you can see he has become a Giallorossi stalwart, in fact a legend.   The whole 2019/20 squad that won me the Champions League trophy was one for the ages. I had so much flair, talent and skill in a team that I didn't even mind playing strikers.

footballmanagergames,3dvao6,MrStoleYourGirl,4,Sun Jul 19 20:36:55 2015 UTC,"Depends, how long does he have left on his contract? If only a short time he might leave, but if it is someone requesting a transfer with time left, I usually transfer list them and ask for a high sum, so they A. get out for a good fee. or B. they don't get bought and eventually asked to be taken off the transfer list."
footballmanagergames,3dvao6,roguemerc96,3,Sun Jul 19 21:47:54 2015 UTC,"In conversations with him, sometimes appears the option to promise achieve higher objectives to make him stay (this happens usually when the player want to left to a bigger club). For example if you are usually a contender to the tittle, saying that if he says the team next year will win the championship or will go even further in the UCL.   This is good if you really think that you can achieve that, and the player will be more happy and loyal to you. But it can have a very negative side, if you can't really achieve those objectives that you propose, the whole team may turn against you by ""making false promises"""

If someone does want to pay over the odds for your player, then at least you're going to make some decent cash to find a better replacement."

footballmanagergames,3dsoyr,sarcastr0naut,12,Sun Jul 19 14:42:03 2015 UTC,"This is something that once or twice worked for me: try pressing ""Use existing terms"", which would bring the current player's contract terms on the screen, or simply ""Undo"", if you already exchanged one or two offers.

You can usually find one player out of contract or running out of contract, so offer them a rediculous contract with a huge agent fee. Delay the confirmation and quickly try to rush through the purchase of Storm again, you might find the agent has a better opinion of you and will charge a lot less. Happy fm'ing friend."

After that I signed a bunch of players that were without contracts (maybe too many but I felt like the squad was pretty thin of players) I ended up signing Trani in goal, Matt Fry for a LB, Ibrahim Atiku as an AM, Jamie Darvill as a striker (who has outright sucked so far) and then a few younger players for depth at weaker positions such as sergio sanchez, and pelayo Gomez-Pico (what an awesome name)  Things seem to be going well so far, but I wondered if people could give me some advice on maybe things I need to sort out, or anything I'm overlooking. I really like the idea of training up younger players so I guess that is where I want to focus, not really sure how to do that though."

footballmanagergames,3dt9k2,LevynX,5,Sun Jul 19 18:00:15 2015 UTC,"Would you sell your best player? Even for $100m? Same logic applies here.  You'd need to do it the slow way, get them unsettled and wait till their contract runs out and force a move then."
footballmanagergames,3dt9k2,dufcdarren,5,Sun Jul 19 07:29:30 2015 UTC,"Add percentages of next transfer on top. I have nabbed players worth £20m+ for around £10m up front just by adding a 30-50% clause.  Then when the player captains your side until he retires, you laugh all the way to the bank."

footballmanagergames,3dqf79,Animal31,3,Sat Jul 18 20:56:06 2015 UTC,It means that his lowest attribute is his teamwork. This means that the player prefers to dribble past players even if it would be better to pass the ball. Additionally he will shoot when it is not sensible to as opposed to passing to a player in a better shooting position. It's one of the first stats I look for in an advanced playmaker or any AMC/winger
footballmanagergames,3drhna,tammodi,12,Sat Jul 18 19:22:25 2015 UTC,"What league are you playing? What position did you finish? Did any players have a breakout season? What's your club reputation?   Without listing them for transfer, you'll only get offers for exceptional players, really."
footballmanagergames,3drhna,Italyrools,9,Sat Jul 18 19:27:18 2015 UTC,"Everything he just listed matters a lot when selling players. If you are selling an older player who didn't make many appearances don't expect to get many offers, and if you get one for their listed value that's usually good.   If you just won the league however and want to sell a player in his prime who just had a good season you can expect some really good offers. I sold a 24 year old defender valued at 9 mil for 30 and a 25 year old AM valued at 16 mil for 51, right after I won the league and both had just averaged over 7.0 ratings on the year."
footballmanagergames,3drhna,BagelWarlock,2,Sat Jul 18 19:38:04 2015 UTC,Why did you sell them?
footballmanagergames,3drhna,aeoz,7,Sat Jul 18 20:33:41 2015 UTC,"I only sold them to meet financial fair play. I had a regen defender coming back on loan to replace the defender I sold(with higher potential), and I had an AM I signed on a free coming in next season to replace the AM I was selling. (Sold Dudu for 51 to Zenit and signed Denis Suarez on a free transfer from Barcelona).  Overall the players I was bringing in as replacements weren't immediately as good as the ones I sold, but both had more potential to grow and considering I made almost 80 mil in profits while only slightly weakening the squad in the short term it was good business."
footballmanagergames,3drhna,BagelWarlock,5,Sat Jul 18 20:54:35 2015 UTC,"I'm Serie A with Inter. I've got a few transfer listed and two leagues loaded.   you'll only get offers for exceptional players   I guess, seems annoying though."
footballmanagergames,3drhna,Mackerdaymia,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:54:58 2015 UTC,"Be prepared to sell them for a pittance if you want rid of them. A couple of quid is better than having to terminate the contract. Transfer list them and tell your Chairman/DoF to accept any bids. Then offer him out a few times, maybe ask the player to make a deal himself after a few attempts. It's not always easy, especially if they have high wage demands."
footballmanagergames,3drhna,GralFarrell,3,Sun Jul 19 15:08:30 2015 UTC,"I have found in my Soton save that, for selling it is way better to just wait for offers to arrive. When transfer listing you not only loose bargaining power, but I feel like clubs are less likely to make bids for their true value."
footballmanagergames,3drhna,kierdoyle,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:14:56 2015 UTC,"I find selling really difficult in this game, I play almost exclusively as Chelsea and it's very hard to sell or loan out players. If a player has an excellent year I can usually move them on, but if a player has a good loan spell but just isn't good enough I struggle to sell.  Loaning out 5 star regens rarely happens for me too.  My usual solution is upping their reputation to what would probably be reasonable for a player of their ability, so I get bids of their value, then change it back after."
footballmanagergames,3drhna,zezhf,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:25:10 2015 UTC,"When you are playing with teams like Chelsea, City, PSG, and so on... it's normal to be hard to sell... you are probably paying large wages, and the other teams (the small ones) can't do it... Try to play with a small team, even Sevilla is small enougth, one good year and half your players are begging to be sold to Chelsea and Real Madrid"

footballmanagergames,3dq5dq,cperrr,16,Sat Jul 18 12:46:50 2015 UTC,I take like 100 hours per season.
footballmanagergames,3dq5dq,Ilandar,3,Sat Jul 18 12:54:58 2015 UTC,Dang that's a lot!
footballmanagergames,3dq5dq,cperrr,16,Sat Jul 18 12:57:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm really slow. I usually play the first 15 minutes of every match in full and then switch to comprehensive highlights if everything is is going to plan. If it's an important match or a knockout one, I'll always watch the whole match. If I play faster my results suffer and I drop points that I could have otherwise saved."
footballmanagergames,3dq5dq,Ilandar,8,Sat Jul 18 13:27:55 2015 UTC,"Wow! I don't have the patience to pay that much attention to my matches lol. I can pick up on where things are going wrong based on the assisstant's comments and keeping an eye on the highlights.  I play maybe two hours 3-4 nights a week, and get through a season in about a week and a half.  On my only save since starting FM15 I'm in 2020/2021 and have racked up 167 hours of play."
footballmanagergames,3dq5dq,kevio17,7,Sat Jul 18 13:33:20 2015 UTC,"I can pick up on where things are going wrong based on the assisstant's comments   I hate the assistant comments. I've completely muted them now and I generally don't use him at all. I've found the advice there to be way too specific and it seems to change far too often to build a stable performance from. Good to hear other people are making use of it, though!   On my only save since starting FM 15 I'm in 2020/2021 and have racked up 167 hours of play.   I play a lot less than I used to. Since I bought FM 2014 early last year, I've played ~324 hours but I'm only halfway through my third season. My longest ever save was an FM 2006 one that I played between 2009 and 2011. I managed seven seasons with that one, but the first six were played on my netbook with extremely long loading times. The ability to add leagues to current saves has completely changed the game for me and it's now way easier to stick with long saves because I can keep the loading time down."
footballmanagergames,3dq5dq,Ilandar,2,Sat Jul 18 14:15:59 2015 UTC,Gotcha. Maybe that's why I suck so much lol. But I am playing in England Level 12 lol.
footballmanagergames,3dq5dq,cperrr,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:37:16 2015 UTC,"It's probably part of your problem. The less matches you watch, the less you understand about the competitions you're competing in and how to get the best out of your team.  Playing in lower leagues definitely makes things harder, though. I started with a mid-table (but financially unstable) J3 team in FM 2014 and although I'm pushing for promotion to the J1 in only my third season (won the J3 in my first), finances are awful and the small stature of my club has severely limited me in the transfer market. In FM 2011 I managed a fifth tier Swedish club, won the league then moved to a second tier Malaysian club and won the league there but again I ran into the same problem where it was difficult to grow the club at the rate I was progressing. In both of these saves most of my success was down to match day decisions and my overall tactical philosophy at the club. There were a lot of games where I was on track for a loss but managed to turn it into a draw or a win with some tweaking or a substitution.  Tier 12 requires a lot of dedication, though! I hope you're not planning to stick with the same team the whole way through. D:"

footballmanagergames,3dq5dq,Ilandar,3,Sun Jul 19 02:46:50 2015 UTC,"Football Manager says 47 Days, 18 hours and 22 Minutes :D, but the game was sometimes on idle. Think 12 hours is a good time for a season. Depends most if i make transfers or need to renew the contracts.  The save is now 1.5 years old, so it's time to switch full to FM 2015 :)."

Last year i was only 2nd (lost my last game against Dortmund so they get champions) and lost in DFB Pokal. So no chance to play for the Super Cup in this season. Last year i won only the Champions League.  I don't think that i play further. The only reason would be to play in my new stadium but it would took 2 seasons more until i can play there.

Aiming to improve on last season's English quadruple (community shield, league cup, league title and FA cup) by either going undefeated in the league or claiming the champions league also.  Absolutely loving this save. I've gone from Wales u21s, to Wales, to Crystal Palace before very short, unsuccessful stints with Manchester United and Napoli. I joined the Albion from the bottom of League 1 in January 2021 and as they say, the rest is history...  5 league titles (League 1, Championship and 3x Premier League), 2 FA Cups in cabinet, 5 league cup and 2 community shield wins have me at legend status so far, but I want to be an icon and win the league undefeated and the champions league before returning to international management.  Personally I also had a few trophies from my time with Palace and Napoli respectively, mainly with the former (winning League 1 and Championship as well as 2 FA Cups and 3 league cups). Also took Wales to the World Cup 2018 final with Bale, Ramsey and a regen Cardiff striker named Thomas Williams, who retired aged 27.  I fear the day I grow bored of this save.

While DPs can help smooth out issues on your team, you don't need them to win titles.  2) Learn to love your academy. Homegrowns are off the books, and the intake players are usually mostly viable for the MLS level of play.  3) For international players, look towards the Americas. European players tend to be more expensive, but try to find North and South American players who have gone out of contract.  4) If a player is on a big wage and is not playing well, feel free to cut him. Before the contract guarantee date, there's no penalty.  5) In addition to the academy, utilize the draft, although it's typically top-heavy, so you want one of the top picks.  6) MLS especially exposes the FM AI. It can be exposed in European leagues, but it's harder to see, but the FM AI struggles to handle MLS's rules, which means teams make stupid trades and waive their third goalkeeper all the time."
footballmanagergames,3dqkk8,ebEliminator,2,Sat Jul 18 18:34:07 2015 UTC,"You can also find some real bargains in Africa.  And AI is stupid with MLS. Before MLS Cup, trade your first round pick for the team that finished last 1st round pick to get first in the draft."

footballmanagergames,3dpbfb,ya_scallywag,5,Sat Jul 18 05:21:10 2015 UTC,"The board gives a budget based on the current financial state of the club, so even if the budget does not carry over, not spending that money means that you will probably get a bigger budget next year as there's a good chance that you'll have more money in the bank.  The only way to get to a $400m transfer budget is to be coaching one of the two or three richest clubs in the world, with a huge fan base, a huge TV contract, great merchandising and most likely, you'd have to be selling quite a few players to get to that number (since every dollar that you receive in transfer fees generally goes straight into the money that you can then spend on transfers). I've played a five-star reputation team (won quite a bit with Fiorentina in Serie A) and even with rich owners, I never got a budget above 80 million Euro for transfers."

footballmanagergames,3dpbfb,zzirWhale,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:54:59 2015 UTC,"I find it depends on your salary control, I generally keep the budget slider all the way to the left (salary side), so I have no transfer budget, but a wage budget that's a lot higher then what I'm spending and come the third year I was allowed to retain 100% of transfers."

footballmanagergames,3dn6gs,NastyFilthyHobbitses,7,Fri Jul 17 17:07:44 2015 UTC,"What club are you at, and what is it's reputation? When PSG come calling, the LB surely got very excited, and pressured management to accept the deal. If your rep is lower, the player might not be as excited, and therefore won't apply any pressure to move. Yes. It depends. If they need to work on their skills or hone their physicals, I keep them at home, unless I can get a sweet loan deal. Their primary growth will be in mental stats, and that's only if they're playing a lot in a league that challenges them. Send them to too low a club and they'll dominate but not gain much.  I did get my current world-beater WB to loan at Stuttgart for 2 seasons, which was great. They have good coaching and facilities, and they play in a tough league, so all of his stats went up.  I had this problem too... then it went away. No idea why.  You can tell your GM / DOF to do that for you.  Depends... how many leagues do you have loaded?"
footballmanagergames,3dn6gs,Italyrools,2,Fri Jul 17 17:34:59 2015 UTC,"About 4: Have you had any results with using staff members to renegotiate contracts? I always suffer it myself as, at the back of my mind, I really doubt they'll be able to make as good a deal as I could if I slog through the fifteen minutes of negotiating with folk.  I did once play a game where I left all signings/contracts/renegotiations in the hands of my staff. Let's just say I don't think the club's accountants were too pleased with that decision, and since then I've kept a closer watch on contracts, especially for staff and the first-team.  Cheers for the advice on loaning players - I've been wondering about that a while now."

If the player wants to come to you, he'll get pissed off it was rejected. Declare your interest a few times in him, and always talk about him positively in the press. That will make him try and force a move, so you'll end up paying less. I always notice that teams who want mental money for a player end up selling him for peanuts 6 months later. Think it's just the shitty AI! First team football is better than the youth system in my opinion. Just depends on the quality of opposition! Not sure... Not sure, and yes it's a ball ache.

footballmanagergames,3dn6gs,helfj16,2,Fri Jul 17 17:31:13 2015 UTC,"1: is all about club reputation and the players willingness to move from their current club. The higher your rep / leagues rep leads to a greater chance of a well known player to move to your club.  Most of the time if you do have that strong reputation you can offer a low amount that will be intentionally declines and use that to unsettle your target player and make them request a move   3: I tend to shift around a players focus between position and specific attributes to see if that's the issue for their complaints, if they are a young player that I put a lot of value into then I will try to mentor them to get a good mentality ( more willing to suck it up   Also this can stem from how much you are making them work out with the team in preparation for matches"
footballmanagergames,3dn6gs,weakpotatoe,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:28:07 2015 UTC,I honestly just let the coaches and assistant manager deal with fitness and training so I don't get complaints about training intensity. When I did get complaints I just ignored them.
footballmanagergames,3dn6gs,Reapppo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:37:34 2015 UTC,"Either because of your clubs sature or because the their coach hates you. Clubs from a same league or rival clubs will not trade with you unless the coach likes you and the offer is good enough. And clauses are sometimes really expensive. In this case, PSG may actually paid 30m or even higher for that guy (19m + 6m or even higher clauses). Keep them until they gain home grown status then send them out until you need them in the first time. They are pussy, that's all. Young training facility, alot of young coaches will helps reducing the training workload.  You should handle the contracts yourself. AI tend to hand out generous contracts which is bad for your team's salary budget. Turn off some leagues and it will become faster. If your game has only EU clubs then of course, you will rarely see Asia cup or Africa cup unless your player or the players from the EU clubs play for those cups. But if your game has EU, Asian, African clubs then you will also see Asia cup and Africa cup, they will still happen even if you dont subscribe. The matches of those cups will still be played and that's what are slowing you down.  Of course, the more leagues you have in your game, the more players you will get every year, it will also slow down your game alot."
footballmanagergames,3dn6gs,soluuloi,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:57:29 2015 UTC,"Let the ""added clauses"" work for you: throw in a ""25% of next sale"" or bonuses tied to player performance at the club. I've had clubs counter with silly demands, I cut them back by 50% and pile on the clauses. Or I let my DOF/HoYD take care of transfer offers and set myself as ""finalize contracts"" so they don't mortage the team. I've actually cancelled some contract bids because the DOF wants to pay the player more than what is left in the salary budget.  At the very least, keep them loaned ""in-country"" so they're eligible for the ""trained in country"" requirement. If they've have a current 1-gold-star rating or better, I keep them at the club so they'll qualify as ""trained at club"" and I can give them a few spot starts throughout the season.  I just let them complain, it's generally a factor of their personality type. If you baby them, the other players will start resenting it.  You can set the players you don't want to renew as ""not needed"" and then let your staff handle the ""decides which contracts to renew"" and set yourself for final approval. ALWAYS review the contract before it gets final approval.  the more leagues loaded (and the further into the game) the bigger the player database and the longer it takes to chug through ""cup play"" and final days of transfer periods."

footballmanagergames,3dmtxv,GucciJacuzzi,5,Fri Jul 17 18:01:40 2015 UTC,I started a save with a lower league team in the USA and everything was working well but it's June in 2015 and NYCFC or Orlando City hasn't been added to MLS. If I buy the in game editor can I manually add them?
footballmanagergames,3dmtxv,podunkboy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:27:18 2015 UTC,"I don't think the in-game editor allows editing of league structure or moving teams around. If you're using an edited league database, it's likely that the creator didn't enable NYCFC and Orlando. Was it mentioned in the database description?"
footballmanagergames,3dmtxv,KujiPR,3,Sat Jul 18 02:51:00 2015 UTC,"Story time: I decided to do an unemployed journey and went for a vacation (eating chips, doing research on youtube) and at the end of the first season, Burnley opens a spot. They got relegated along with Hull.  I signed a contract with them, I get no expectations and a pretty decent budget around $11 million. Surely nothing will go wrong...  ...5 players now want to bail out. Crap, including Ings and all the first team studs. Yay -_-"
footballmanagergames,3dmtxv,podunkboy,4,Fri Jul 17 17:56:52 2015 UTC,"well, if your manager reputation is low, there's nothing to keep them there in the hopes of promotion. Best thing you can do: Set their asking price high so if someone does poach them you can buy 2-3 good prospects, handle them with kid gloves while giving them ample opportunity to play, win some games, give them praise, etc.  I took over at Bayern with world-wide reputation and still had players asking to leave before we even played a league game. I sold a couple worst offenders and replaced them with younger, better players, kept the door open and tried to keep them happy, by November we were top of the league and everyone left was happy."
footballmanagergames,3dmtxv,madviking,3,Sat Jul 18 02:57:47 2015 UTC,Questions: what does staff reputation affect other than salary? Are world-class coaches/scouts better than regional level coaches/scouts?  How does staff reputation change?   Is there a way to turn off scouting updates? I don't need my 20 or so scouts telling me about the same 10 players every week.

footballmanagergames,3dmtxv,MagicManGreg,2,Fri Jul 17 22:25:42 2015 UTC,"I don't get this game, never have. I'm not particularly great at it, I'll accept that. I don't understand what player roles fit tactics like most of the posters on here do, and what instructions to use etc.  My team went unbeaten at the start of the season, with seven wins and a draw. I didn't chance my tactics drastically, nor the players in the team. Yet I hit an awful slump of not being able to score goals. I was rescuing a draw with far and away the worst side in the league at home. I was scraping by Junior sides in the cup. I was getting ripped apart by mid table sides, with the highlights showing my side not even able to make a pass to the right man.  Not even the fact I wasn't scoring, I wasn't even getting shots on target. 10 shots, two on target for my last match. I had one shot in the highlights for the match, a pathetic header that went straight to the keeper.  Most of the goals I concede are as a result of my team acting like inept morons.   I get that slumps happen in this game, but it's infuriating when you change very little, but on the pitch it's completely different."
footballmanagergames,3dmtxv,MattyCraney,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:45:51 2015 UTC,"Changing little is why you're in a slump, the teams you're playing know your tactics now and can play to prevent them from working."

I haven't played much Scottish League this year (after playing almost all Scottish for the previous 3 years), but I always like to start up by loading in all the lower Scottish players and finding an extended database so there's better regen creation. And if English clubs come calling, wring as much money as you can out of them.  re: free signings, I go into the scouting menu, pull up att the out-of-contract/no-contract players, find ones with good attributes in determination/pace/teamwork/stamina and have the scouts look them over.

If you have the choice between a player with decent physicals and bad technical stats and decent technical but bad physical, go for the former.  Obviously you'd want both, but it's not always possible. Go for physical stats because it will lessen injuries in a (presumably) small squad, ensure that your players don't tire and let in sloppy goals and mean that you might get up the other end and nick a late goal. Strength, stamina and pace are obviously key to this."

footballmanagergames,3dkyz6,podunkboy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:16:00 2015 UTC,It can't be because friendlies auto-number the keeper with kit no. 1and the outfielders with kit numbers 2-11 and there's players with a kit number bigger than 11.
footballmanagergames,3dli7k,tungkidz,10,Fri Jul 17 06:15:40 2015 UTC,"Get percentage of next sale, not the profit of next sale"
footballmanagergames,3dli7k,ShetlandJames,3,Fri Jul 17 09:29:43 2015 UTC,This. Chances are they won't make a profit on the next sale haha
footballmanagergames,3dli7k,CuBu,9,Fri Jul 17 11:58:40 2015 UTC,Line up a replacement for cheaper and that seems like a great deal. And knowing the A.I. the percentage of next transfer will come through soon gifting you more.
footballmanagergames,3dli7k,Jrvs13,3,Fri Jul 17 06:36:21 2015 UTC,Its percentage of profit so unlikely to get anything
footballmanagergames,3dli7k,DorothyJMan,2,Fri Jul 17 10:19:45 2015 UTC,Does the profit start from the price paid up front or the entire price inc add ons?
footballmanagergames,3dli7k,05banks,2,Fri Jul 17 12:03:19 2015 UTC,Entire price
footballmanagergames,3dli7k,weakpotatoe,5,Fri Jul 17 14:36:49 2015 UTC,"The chance of him playing 50 league games to get that bonus is probably pretty minimal, so maybe try and negotiate a bit more actual cash, but other than that, yeah I'd definitely take it!"
footballmanagergames,3dli7k,covmatty1,2,Fri Jul 17 07:49:13 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I always remove that clause as the there's a solid chance that he will play 10 games and gets unhappy + sold a transfer windows later."

footballmanagergames,3dli7k,emslieboy98,2,Fri Jul 17 13:35:39 2015 UTC,Honestly I don't mind it. I obviously would prefer cash up front but if this is the only way the deal works then I'll just deal with it
footballmanagergames,3dli7k,weakpotatoe,2,Fri Jul 17 14:46:58 2015 UTC,"When they give you a deal that has a lot of expensive clauses, it means that they really want the guy but they dont have enough cash at the moment. If you can, try lower the price to 60m or 50m and they may buy him immediately without any clause."
footballmanagergames,3dli7k,soluuloi,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:03:00 2015 UTC,When I'm a team struggling financially it is nice to get it month by month. Instead of being losing money every month sometimes you make a little
footballmanagergames,3dli7k,vette91,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:13:03 2015 UTC,"If you lock the money after 50 appearances at 10 appearances instead usually they will accept it. Same with international appearances, could lock it at 1 or 5 instead of the 10 it says above. Often they won't let you negotiate the percentage of profit to percentage of next transfer unless you lower it to 15 or 10%. Other than that i think its a good deal, sign someone even better with the money!"

But maybe try to do your own tactic next season(if you want, seeing as it is not up to me to decide how you play =) ) because the one you use is one that abuses and breaks the match engine because it can't cope with 3 strikers. I find it more rewarding on the long run when it works.  Vive Lyon though!!"
footballmanagergames,3dngc0,thumbthrower,2,Fri Jul 17 19:01:56 2015 UTC,"Really? It breaks the match engine? Aww, that makes it feel a bit less impressive :-/ But nah, I play FM for squad management, tactics never really appealed to me.  As for Grenier, most of the time he was playing as a Roaming Playmaker, filling in the defensive midfield occaisionally. Roaming Playmaker was definitly where we excelled though."
footballmanagergames,3dngc0,thumbthrower,2,Fri Jul 17 19:09:32 2015 UTC,Thanks!

On the lower levels, you can only have 4 players over 22, so you can really develop youth (if your youth facilities weren't crap at that level). If you load all the levels, it's 1620 teams, no matter how bad your manager is at the beginning, they'll find a job for you."

Mixing it up and trying something new like you said has proved very entertaining. National sides can be fun as well, someone like England or Ukraine who maybe are not considered the true world elite like Germany or Argentina makes it challenging but rewarding to win trophies. If you are looking for a national team to manage, this list could come in handy. Hope that helps!"

footballmanagergames,3dkb9z,StupidMastiff,3,Thu Jul 16 23:29:35 2015 UTC,How can this annihilate your tactic? This looks like Genoa are just asking for you to grab possession and just overwhelm their defence
footballmanagergames,3dkb9z,Kaninen,5,Fri Jul 17 00:38:29 2015 UTC,"Fuck knows, I play possession football as well, but the Milan team at the time were easily the best in the world."
footballmanagergames,3dkb9z,StupidMastiff,3,Fri Jul 17 00:56:36 2015 UTC,"Everytime they get the ball they just have to get it forward as fast as possible. There are at least 4 possible recipients for long passes. And if, for example, they use 2 defensive strikers they can put good pressure on the opponents CBs and DMs therefore forcing them to play long, risky passes. Risky tactic but it could work out, especially with strong CBs."
footballmanagergames,3dkb9z,Luk0sch,2,Fri Jul 17 10:23:25 2015 UTC,"I did something similar when I took over Real Madrid on my LLM-save in like 2040. They had the best players on every single position and a huge budget, so I played something like 3-6-1 with 3 playmaking midfielders (with decent defensive stats) as defenders who basically dumped the ball towards my offensive players who just spat out goals. I would usually concede a couple of goals, but I would win the games like 9-3, 7-2 and such.  However, if you aren't like 100% dominant, you will not be able to have any possession gained from your central defenders/midfielders and thus you can't get any chances."

footballmanagergames,3dk3uu,BRONXSBURNING,6,Thu Jul 16 22:27:58 2015 UTC,I find Work the Space enjoyable so check him out on YouTube and get inspiration from there. One thing i would say is do a team no one has ever done b4. E.g. most fm utubers have done a 'Road to the Top' with a low English team. I wouldn't mind watching a series where a 4th tier Croatian team reach Champion's league glory heavily relying on youth.

As the user above stated, I am much more interested in someone bringing up an unknown or simply low-ranked team than taking over a big club. (as /u/fardin94 stated preferably not an English club, those are overdone) Maybe keep us up to date with important global events happening in your simulation. For example big transfers, strange champion's league winners, world cup etc. I want to see behind-the-scenes action not just the games. What I really wish I saw from Work The Space were things like:     Hiring staff (How to go about hiring the right people, what roles to hire for, how many to hire). Individual training assignments and team training How you worked out your main tactics, including which team instructions/style you chose and why.  Furthermore, setting up set-piece tactics if you do that at all. (One of the parts of the game which there is seemingly little information) Scouting for new signings (I know WTS did a couple videos in the past on this)   I hope this helps, it's just what I as a newbie enjoy seeing and learning about other than the obvious match-day videos."

footballmanagergames,3dl6lx,LDM95,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:04:02 2015 UTC,"This is a pretty well known bug that sometimes creeps up in FM14.  I've had it where some players will ask every month for more first team playing time, I agree and start them the next 2 or 3 matches, only for them to put in a transfer request saying that I didn't live up to my promise.  If the guy has a few more years on his contract I'd just tell him to buck up and wait until he settles down, which should be around the time the next season starts.    This also reminds of a  time when I had a player ask me every month to get more first team playing time, and each month I assertively told him he's just a back up so he can't expect to play.  This went on for nearly 2 years until I finally just off loaded him for a few mill."
footballmanagergames,3djusi,Enter_0,3,Thu Jul 16 21:19:42 2015 UTC,"The only time I did these leagues, my steps were:   Sign fast players for the attack (Wingers and Strikers) Sign solid CBs Simple tactics. Basic 4-4-2 and variations of this Win."

footballmanagergames,3djusi,barneythepurplethot,2,Fri Jul 17 12:33:35 2015 UTC,"Another tip to help your budget.  Always have backup players who can play multiple positions decently. Even better if they are coaches/assistant managers also.  Comes in really handy to have a 34 year-old coach who can sit on the bench and cover for any DC/DL/DM/CM or similar. Multiple positions covered by one player.  TL;DR More positions, less players."
footballmanagergames,3djusi,dufcdarren,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:13:27 2015 UTC,"Physical attributes are key, since nobody can pass, shoot, or dribble with consistency. Also, keep a close watch on your budget, your club can easily go under. To help with this, try to link up wth a big parent club that will loan you players and pay their wages. It can help reduce your expenditure for a few years while you're  (hopefully) getting promoted a few times."
footballmanagergames,3djusi,BIiteum,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:30:55 2015 UTC,"Look for players who are can also fill a staff role- mostly Free Agents (never pay transfer fees in lower leagues). These guys are 30+ years old but they often have decent stats both as players and coaches/scouts and are willing to sign for a low salary; even if they're not good enough for your first squad you can keep them around as a backup.  Also, get a fitness coach and a GK coach (not a must) and play a lot of pre-season friendlies (every 4-5 days) vs. teams of similar strength as yours or even weaker to a)get your players' Match Fitness up and b)get team morale up (if you win most of the friendlies)  Signing players- if you want to go for promotion every season, sign players that are good now, rather than 1-star garbage with 5-star potential. Sign them on a season-to-season basis (1 year contracts)"

The Vanarama leagues are a massive step up, straight away. I've tried to tweak my tactics where possible to be slightly more defensive, as the strikers in step two are just a huge step up. I've got a squad that I think could be mid-table with the right tinkering, but after a 4-3 opening day win, I haven't scored in the next four games. A draw and three defeats.  Usually I go for a 4-1-4-1 with a holding midfielder behind a flat midfield four, with a false nine up front to link up with the attacking wingers and AP. It suited me really well in step three but I'm not too sure where to go from here. My wingers have pace, my lone striker (or two if I switch to a more direct 4-4-2) have pace and power, without much in the way of technical ability, yet scoring is an issue."

There are 54 nations in UEFA. There are (54 choose 6)= 25827165 potential different groups.  How many groups have 4 specific countries in them? Well, we're always given those 4 countries and have 2 spots to fill in. We can fill those spots in 50*49 = 2450 ways.  So out of total 25827165 groups, 2450 have England, Norn Iron, Scotland and Wales together. Thats' about 0.00009486136, or 0.01% of chance for such group to be drawn: about 1 in 10000."

Teams in pot 1 can not be drawn in the same group as each other, teams in pot 2 can not be drawn in the same group etc for all 6 pots.

footballmanagergames,3dfm7e,ENKC,0,Thu Jul 16 05:27:27 2015 UTC,"So, for a Euro group, the math looks like this:  (1/52)x(1/51)x(1/50)x(1/49)  Essentially, it's one divided by the number of eligible teams remaining multiplied by one divided by the new number of teams remaining as many times as it takes to have the number of teams you like.

footballmanagergames,3dfm7e,ENKC,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:32:28 2015 UTC,And I explained that. The formula is this: (1/n)x(1/(n-1))x(1/(n-2))x(1/(n-3))=p  Where n is the number of European teams available for qualification and p is the probability of it occurring.

There are lots of guides out there on how to do this but in the simplest of terms:   Scout all players Organise your shortlist by age and potential  Add a column for asking price (no point over-paying on players)

footballmanagergames,3dfw2i,therablador,5,Wed Jul 15 23:15:45 2015 UTC,"For the record, this was my heaviest ever defeat on FM by a longshot and I'm hoping it was a one-off! I used the same tactics that had seen me win at Old Trafford, and indeed we had won four of the past five games (including completing a league double over United), so I certainly was not expecting this. We were 4-0 down at half time with Chelsea scoring on virtually every highlight so I, seeking mercy, let the second half roll while I took a break from FM for a few minutes! I came back to find us 9-0 down with minutes to go, which is when I finally decided to make tactical changes, bringing on all three subs at once. Coincidentally one of those subs scored from the kick-off meaning we avoided the unwanted record of heaviest ever Premier League defeat, instead I believe only equalling that one :P   It happens to us all, I guess. Feel free to share your own shambolic results, I'd quite like some sympathy right about now ;)"

I haven't done LLM with this version of FM but I've done it with previous editions and it's odd when you look at your club screen and your ""rivals"" are 6 divisions below you. sigh I just don't see this conversation taking place:  ""Well, sure, Maidenhead have had a back and forth battle with United for titles but their REAL rivals are the bastards at Brackley Town.""  ""When's the last time they played Brackley Town?""  ""Oh, um... about 25 years ago.""  ""......""  I'd also like to see player interactions fixed.... and match/transfer confidence as well.  I'm not saying the fans have to love every signing and buy <player name> realdolls and name their future children after them... but good grief. I sold our 3rd choice keeper (Lindegaard) to a Serie A club that had come into some money (from selling a young player or two).  He was better than the best keeper they had. He was guaranteed to get a lot of match time... and I managed to get a good price for him.  The way the fans reacted you'd think I sold him to a rival for two pence and a can of treacle.. O_o  Is anyone else getting match confidence that seems to change when you look at it later on?  I (playing as Man United) won a (friendly) cup final against Bayern 5-0. Fan match confidence was something like 65%. I looked at it a few weeks (in-game) later and the match confidence for that match is 95% now. Wtf?!"

Outside of that more options for player/media interaction and an option to watch training days and see rivalries /friendships between players

I still think you should've restarted your save to get a proper preseason in, but I guess it's a bit late for that now.  Have you figured out that your intake is on a unique team, different from your main team? (it'll be called Chicago Fire Academy or whatever), Look at your intake and bring in whoever suits you, and make sure to bring in the best players to keep them from being draft-eligible. HG players are also off the salary cap.  90-95% of American players in MLS are rubbish on FM, you may as well bring in some young guys and build potential."

footballmanagergames,3dgexx,MeNoHobo,3,Thu Jul 16 01:50:49 2015 UTC,"I got into 2013 a month or so before 2014 came out with a very limited knowledge about the sport (I thought buying players from Chelsea as an Arsenal manager was just the regular thing to do). That being said, I think you'd need a little patience with the game at first, and although 2016 is probably gonna be here by a few months, FM15 is still a good buy if you can find it cheaply. I'd recommend maybe finding a guide or something online if you do decide to get it, as I was recently explaining to my friend about the game and I just blew her mind apparently.   Also, as a fairly ""new"" follower, I wouldn't know what to tell you about buying one of the older versions as opposed to 2015. Right now, I'm enjoying FM15 as much as I did 2014, so maybe my opinion isn't as valued as someone's else's..."
footballmanagergames,3dgexx,_thebrandonator_,3,Thu Jul 16 06:31:22 2015 UTC,"Sorry, It's currently 2.30 am here and I just reread your post and realized I haven't answered any of your questions haha.    I think you might do just fine. In fact, FM was one of the bigger reasons I managed to find a favorite team. I always like managerial-type games, and when I chose Arsenal I haven't looked back. You just have to realize that if you choose Real Madrid as your team (if you do get it, just saying) that you won't be able to buy Barcelona players without dealing with like ridiculous, well, like stuff. I remember choosing Liverpool on one of my early saves (before I really chose arsenal) and trying to buy Lionel Messi and getting frustrated at how ""stupid this game was"" for not letting me buy him. So like, you'll learn about the sport over time. Maybe early on, you might struggle a bit but you'll learn, man. It's part of the experience for newbies like me.  Yeah. Like I said, I wouldn't really know. I honestly think you'd enjoy it. I think most of the negative reviews are from people who have been truly into the game for 3+ years and haven't seen much of upgrades through the years. I think for newer fans, these reviews shouldn't be that big. Then again, I wouldn't know...   There's always the demo if you just want to try it out, I forgot how long it last but I'm sure it's around 6-12 months.   I'm sure some other people would comment on this post, and have more knowledge and better answers than I do.   Just wanted to give my two cents :)"
footballmanagergames,3dgexx,_thebrandonator_,3,Thu Jul 16 06:42:10 2015 UTC,"I would say following the sport is a big part of it and would enhance your experience in the game.

It is a lot better simulation and way more polished than EHM seems to be right now though."
footballmanagergames,3dgexx,Argocap,2,Thu Jul 16 06:42:23 2015 UTC,"As someone who has tried the opposite (getting into american simulation games) It can be difficult without knowledge of the sport to know what your doing.   One major advantage that you have is that FM is a very polished game that looks and feels great. Something EHM lacks, which made it harder for me to enjoy (not knowing the tactical side and unable to really see what is happening). The 3D match engine looks great in FM and is getting better each year.   If your a serious sports fan or have at least some interest in soccer, then I reccomend you give it a try. It's the best soccer simulation and a great game overall. You'll pick it up as you go."
footballmanagergames,3dgexx,hotpointGG,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:50:15 2015 UTC,"I'd say watch a few matches of football because if you want to really get into the game you need to get into the sport itself. It will also help you gain the basic knowledge of football you really need  to know if you want to get into football manager.  If you really want to watch football now you can watch MLS, those matches do not show the greatest display of football but they're all you have right now. because at the moment all the major leagues England, Spain, Germany and Italy are on summer break but when they come back you should really watch a game or two of them or at least watch the greatest highlight show of England: BBC's Match of the day  I also strongly suggest visiting /r/soccer to get your love of football up where it belongs  And at the time you've done all of this, 2016 is probably already out or almost at least so you could buy that, or 2015 if the large price of 2016 is a  problem for you"

I sold him to Liverpool for 20M I think. Squad called a meeting saying I made a mistake selling Patrick because he was our best prospect. Now he plays for QPR.

footballmanagergames,3de1s4,Italyrools,14,Wed Jul 15 15:22:06 2015 UTC,"Purchasing Prospects  So I've found the next big thing, let's say he's anywhere between 16 and 18 years old. I can never purchase him for a reasonable price.   For instance: 18 YO, France (smaller club in L1, I think it was Montpellier) ~100 CA, ~180 PA  They want $80 mil. With similar stats an Argentinian cost me ~$40 mil, which still seems high. Clubs are buying unproven prospects for up to $10 mil today, nothing higher.  Is there some art to negotiating?  Edit: I'll try and remember to post pictures when I get home from work"
footballmanagergames,3de1s4,claustrophobicdragon,6,Wed Jul 15 15:39:23 2015 UTC,"Which club are you playing as? Apparently that has some effect, though I can't confirm that. Also keep in mind that not all youth prospects are created equal! They may be more important to their club and thus unlikely to sell."
footballmanagergames,3de1s4,Italyrools,3,Wed Jul 15 16:33:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, in one case he was already the clubs best player, so I suppose I shouldn't be too surprised.   Playing as LA Galaxy on a modified database. AFAIK club only matters for reputation, is that wrong?"
footballmanagergames,3de1s4,claustrophobicdragon,3,Wed Jul 15 21:01:22 2015 UTC,"That might be part of the issue idk but I read somewhere on here that teams like Man City are better at bargaining(I think because of reputation?) than, say, Millwall, and that means the price for someone is lower for City."
footballmanagergames,3de1s4,Homem_do_Bussaco,9,Wed Jul 15 21:25:39 2015 UTC,"That doesn't make much sense, if anything, prices should be higher for City because clubs know they're willing to pay."

footballmanagergames,3de1s4,DaWolf85,2,Thu Jul 16 15:45:31 2015 UTC,"If they want to join your club, especially if they are extremely interested, declare interest and wait at least half a season. The price will drop by quite a bit. I had an American prospect who was 180 PA and DC United were demanding $20M for him. Declared interest in the winter transfer window, by the summer I got him for $5.75M and they in fact seemed quite eager to get rid of him."
footballmanagergames,3de1s4,Italyrools,3,Wed Jul 15 18:11:42 2015 UTC,"Interesting... ok. I always declare interest every few months just so that he gets in a fight with his manager (I have a really high rep). Should I keep bombarding the club with offers, too? Or do you declare interest once, wait  a bit, and then usually you're all set?"
footballmanagergames,3de1s4,DaWolf85,2,Wed Jul 15 21:00:07 2015 UTC,"I declare interest once and then scout him often. The estimated price should keep dropping and when it gets to a level I like, then I pounce."
footballmanagergames,3de1s4,ClandestineMovah,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:17:20 2015 UTC,"In my experience it's simply a case of signing the players that are interested.  There are three categories of player that you can sign.   The player and/or agent are not interested in signing.   I often add 'scout asking price' (I'm sorry I can't remember the exact name) to the shortlist columns because if there is no value in there then this nearly always indicates there is little interest in signing.   It says, no only do we not want to sell we've not even listed a selling price.  In this instance you'll often have to pay (as you yourself has indicated) well over the odds. I very rarely sign players in this category. In my opinion, if you do, then you're miss-managing the club as it's poor business to buy players this way.   The player and/or agent have some interest in signing.   This is much like above but under shortlist there will be an asking price listed. Often the price will be excessive but further, the agent/player wage demands will be excessive too. In my opinion, it's poor business to sign these players too.   The players and/or agent are keen to sign.   These are the only players I sign. I put as many players on my shortlist because more often than not players will appear (In January and June) available to sign free. Not only that, players which were previously valued excessively will now be vastly reduced in price as contract length plays a large factor.  GL. Feel free to tag on any addendum questions"

footballmanagergames,3de1s4,megarack,4,Wed Jul 15 16:38:04 2015 UTC,"I dont know about other people more experienced in FM, but I usually load la liga, serie A, bpl and bundesliga to see how they progress, also I load my local country league and the one im playing on (of course).  Still, I usually scout players in leagues i dont usually load, like in argentina or brazil. The actual players are still there and can be hired.  Edit: replaced some words"
footballmanagergames,3de1s4,Ebilpigeon,3,Wed Jul 15 20:51:46 2015 UTC,"The more leagues you load, the more potential players you'll see. I don't mind waiting a bit so I load plenty.

footballmanagergames,3de1s4,admartian,5,Wed Jul 15 17:12:37 2015 UTC,"My best experience is tailoring it to your players are naturally able to do. That might mean retraining certain players that aren't naturally or 'accomplished' in a position or role, but have the attributes to be able to play there.  This means that your tactics will be less 'plug n play' and to be able to cater to most/all player types. But that also means that if you buy/train players around the tactic(s) you have made, then you're likely to find more success."
footballmanagergames,3de1s4,SynchronizedHD3,4,Wed Jul 15 20:58:39 2015 UTC,"Keep it simple. Formation, Roles, then Memtality/Style, instructions last. No more than 4-5 instructions"

Trial and error is your best master."
footballmanagergames,3de1s4,admartian,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:43:10 2015 UTC,"There are two main philosophies to begin with and you should pick the one which best suits you and the club you're managing.   Build the tactic around the players   This is better for small clubs as you can tweak the tactic to make better use of the players you have.   Use a tactic you know and trust and build your team around the tactic.   This is better for big clubs as you can afford to go out and sign the players you need.  To begin with tactics just remember this:  Create a simple tactic using the tactics wizard. Try to shape it so it uses the best players in your squad. Note I wrote squad there and not team. You need to build your tactic around your best 25 players, not your best 11.  The best way to get an idea of tactics is to tweak slightly during the match. Do not change it outside of the match unless it is pre-season as changing tactics mid-way can be disastrous."

Lost to Chelsea 4-0 first time we played - since then, I've won 2-1 (extremely lucky last minute goal), drawn 2-2 and won 1-0 (lucky penalty decision). It is possible to neutralise them defensively, but you really have to drop deep, slow everything down and nullify Hazard, Fabregas and Costa (i.e. go in hard on Hazard).   I generally favour possession play, but the one time I've really felt like I was on top of them was by using long balls and moving the ball into the final third quickly. They didn't really seem able to deal with that."

Arsenal were 4-0 down and started their comeback in the second minute of first half injury time, taking ~51 minutes to get back to 4-4 by the end of the second half. The other goals were in extra time, when anything can happen. In OP's match, Celta were 5-0 down, started their comeback in the 56th minute, and took ~29 minutes to get back to 5-5.  Don't get me wrong, Arsenal - Reading was probably one of the all-time greatest footballing comebacks, but OP's example is on a whole other scale. The most comparable example I could find was a U17 international between Portugal and Cameroon in the 2003 U17 World Cup. Cameroon were 5-0 down, started their comeback in the 74th minute, and had the scores level in the space of 20 minutes. So it can happen, but it's still huge, especially in one of the top senior leagues in the world."
footballmanagergames,3daymg,AlekRivard,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:16:01 2015 UTC,"In OP's game, Celta went on to draw 5-5; Arsenal went on to win 7-5 after down 4-0. I would argue what Arsenal did is more impressive."
footballmanagergames,3daymg,ThatVillaDude,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:28:01 2015 UTC,"A win is always going to be more impressive than a draw, but I don't think it's fair to take into account what happened in extra time. In 90 minutes (plus injury time), Arsenal 'only' managed to come back from 0-4 to 4-4, whereas Celta managed 0-5 to 5-5, and took less time about it too."
footballmanagergames,3daymg,ThatVillaDude,2,Wed Jul 15 05:38:56 2015 UTC,"If it helps, OP, it's not just the AI hating you, it does it to itself too. Saw this result between a couple of AI teams a while back, although France U21s started their comeback a fair bit earlier than Celta did in your match."
footballmanagergames,3daymg,Urbiscuit18,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:31:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, freescoring matches. There are quite a few of them in recent generations of FM. I remember they had to increase the frequency of a shot hitting posts and defenders blocking shots to prevent scores being too high."
footballmanagergames,3dd4cy,walvincraith,3,Wed Jul 15 09:36:55 2015 UTC,"Well, your assistant manager is John Carver."
footballmanagergames,3dd4cy,414078,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:45:51 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's because you have limited full backs, if they're not helping midfielders there's no width."
footballmanagergames,3dd4cy,fieldsfields,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:46:53 2015 UTC,"Maybe. My thoughts were that if I gave my full backs too much freedom that my 2 CBs would be left exposed, and they then help to counteract the opposition wingers. But I'll give it a go with leaving them as just FBs."
footballmanagergames,3dd4cy,fieldsfields,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:14:20 2015 UTC,I used this formation and my fullbacks were set as complete wb (s). And player instructions set to tight marking. I don't recall any problems with them pushing up higher. I guess it must be high positioning and wrk rate that keep them from making positional mistakes.
footballmanagergames,3dd4cy,fieldsfields,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:19:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah seems like the general consensus is to set my FBs to C/WBs. The tight marking point is interesting though, never really bother with that when it comes to my full backs."
footballmanagergames,3dd4cy,ChasingLamely,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:33:15 2015 UTC,I guess tight marking keeps them from losing opposing wingers. Works really fine for me
footballmanagergames,3dd4cy,SovietJoe,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:46:38 2015 UTC,"Might be worth trying the Inverted WB role, too. When you're defending, they act like fullbacks. When you're attacking they push into centre mid. Works well if you're playing a possession heavy style, and in the transitional phases they tend to move through DM and can often win the ball back. If the opposition ping a quick ball to the flanks you'd be exposed, but the AI doesn't seem to figure that out often."
footballmanagergames,3dd4cy,SovietJoe,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:13:45 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I've never tried that before. I could even apply that to my 5-2-1-2 WB tactic, and the long balls to the wingers shouldn't be too much of an issue with three CBs"
footballmanagergames,3dd4cy,SovietJoe,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:02:09 2015 UTC,"I used to play a similar formation (with Newcastle, coincidently), and this would happen to me at times when I didn't play my full backs in a more aggressive, attacking role. They won't be closing down their wingers until they reach your back third. To fill the gap caused by your 'Close Down More' instruction conflicting with your LFB's, your CM's (namely Sissoko and Delph) are closing down them down, leaving Lucas Silva to deal with their two DM's and CM by himself. At least, that's what was happening to me. Check the heat maps for your CM's, see if they're getting dragged out to the wings a lot.  You want to either set your FB's to be more aggressive (I set mine to WB/S and that seemed to work quite a lot of the time), change your closing down settings, or tinker with your CM settings until they stop getting dragged out of position."
footballmanagergames,3dd4cy,BIiteum,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:18:45 2015 UTC,"Cheers for the tips. That does seem to make a lot of sense. I forget that limiting your full backs means they e only responsible for closing down towards your own box. But the heat maps will be interesting to see. I will definitely put more faith in my full backs from now on to do a job both attacking and defensively. Incidentally, Tyrone mings is a brilliant choice as wing back, I use him there in my 5-2-1-2 WB formation."

footballmanagergames,3d9dr2,harrison_jones,3,Tue Jul 14 17:34:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah worked for me pretty well from North/South conference all the way to League 1 (England). Considering players at this level are so poor at passing and have generally terrible technical skills (like first touch) and poor decisions/vision, there aren't many other options left.  This last save I tried direct passing, it was a disaster. Some games I'd win vs bigger teams, some I'd lose vs weak ones, the highlights were a pain to watch. There might be a way to use other passing styles but you'd have to get specialist players to make it work."

footballmanagergames,3d9dr2,ya_scallywag,5,Tue Jul 14 17:15:24 2015 UTC,"As u/LiquidEnvy points out, a narrow diamond formation with wing-backs in a back four works really well.

footballmanagergames,3d9dr2,LiquidEnvy,8,Tue Jul 14 23:39:18 2015 UTC,Look up StatApp on youtube. He has a Diamond Dominator formation that runes two Trequaristas in front of a shadow striker. Also runs 2 Wing Backs and 2 CB's.  After one season in the Conference North he got straight promoted right up to the premiership and finished top four first year. Went on to pretty much dominate that and Champions League every season.  Scores tons of goals and is good defensively as well.

footballmanagergames,3d9dr2,Luk0sch,2,Tue Jul 14 21:45:00 2015 UTC,"Diamond with a F9 + Advanced Striker and an Advanced Playmaker with attack duty behind them can be really strong too. The F9 should be really fast, every fast player I tried on that position with that tactic scored an incredible amount of goals even with comparably low finishing ratings, they just got so many chances."

You can send scouts out on assignments to find players, and you can customise the parameters of the assignment so they will find the types of players you want.  You can use the scouting page that displays all known players and use the filters to narrow down the types of players displayed.  You can manually go through teams and get scout reports, which is especially effective when the teams you scout are U19/20 national teams.  You can go to the transfer page, then to Director of Football and ask him to suggest transfers/free agents/loans to you for each poition and role.  There are probably more that I am forgetting, but they are usually the most common methods used."

The ones you will get in your inbox often feature tying players, some of whom have the instruction ""it might be worth keeping a close eye on his development."" Once you have a look at the report and decide whether you like them or not, have a scout observe them for 3 matches or months, depending on how many spare scouts you have lying around. Doing so will fine tune your knowledge of hot prospects and hopefully get you some good wonderkids. Also, if it's transfer season and you see that a major club, such as Chelsea, wants a youngster who doesn't cost a fortune, sign him. Don't even bother scouting just get a deal hammered out before they do. I've always gotten world beaters."

footballmanagergames,3dauzk,SZJX,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:08:03 2015 UTC,I was losing the aggregate anyways so I threw in an all-out-attack 424 (which was actually the formation I used with stronger teams before to dominate the game). The result was quite funny. At least we went out with a bang!

footballmanagergames,3da9me,ynwa-mike,4,Tue Jul 14 18:43:37 2015 UTC,"It's difficult as I'm still playing FM13 but this might help.  I'll try to explain how these relate to counter-attacking football and hopefully you'll be able to compare them to FM15 which is similar. My purpose here is to give you context.   Philosophy   This mainly dictates how strictly your players will follow your instructions. In some cases it's good to have this where your players can 'go out and play but in a strict counter-attack it's best to have this rigid or balanced.   Strategy   We know you're going to start with a stock counter-attacking formation.   Passing Style   For passing we know your team is being outclassed in passing and other areas. I would say play direct but in some regards you're in Europe so your team must have some qualities. In this regard it's best to go mixed or direct.   Creative Freedom   As I remember, the biggest difference this makes is how a player will move. In a counter-attacking formation must make sure your defensive players have very little with perhaps your full backs with a little. You can allow your attacking players a little more freedom.   Closing Down   Personally I would leave this as default. I prefer to have my forward/midfield players chase but there is a real danger that defenders can be pulled out of position by better teams.   Tackling   This should be on hard tackling for when you're managing better teams teams and less for lesser teams. This can make players 'bottle' a tackle but it can also get poor defenders sent off.    Marking   The natural thing here would be to have man marking. The problem is that man marking is exploitable by the opposition. Not only that zonal works better for counter-attack in my experience.   Crossing   The rules I've worked by are, floating crosses when you're the better team. Drill crosses for counter-attacking teams.   Roaming   Yep. Stick to position. As you become more familiar like your better attacking players roam but don't let your defenders roam. Not even your full backs.   Defensive Line   This should be fairly deep for counter-attacking but consider this too. If you sit back you're inviting the opposition to attack you. If you're better attacking then defending that might be the wrong idea. Don't start too defensive as you might be helping the opposition and not hindering them.   Width   I've always felt that attacking teams play wide, defensive teams play narrow. In counter-attack it's useful to exploit the flanks but if you do you yourself are available to counter-attack. I would favour more narrow, personally.   Tempo    This varies but my personal opinion is, when counter-attacking it's best to play at a quicker team to give the opposition less time to get players back.   Time Wasting   More is best here but like defensive line you need to treat this with respect. Better teams will exploit players with poor technique who are time wasting.   Focus Passing   I think I'll refer you to width on this one.   Counter Attack   Not really relevant for us sine you'll be using this anyway but I like CA and use it in many situations.   Play Offside   I wouldn't use this. If you have men behind the ball (as you should) it can make it a lot easier for your opposition to exploit this. I prefer to use offside when in a position of strength.  Lastly, 4-5-1 is great when counter-attacking. (that's a flat five across the midfield)  It stops the opposition playing and leaves men free to break.  GL."
footballmanagergames,3da9me,ClandestineMovah,3,Tue Jul 14 20:39:41 2015 UTC,"This is fantastic, nice post thanks mate"
footballmanagergames,3da9me,ClandestineMovah,3,Tue Jul 14 20:54:38 2015 UTC,"You're welcome.  One last thing. I'm not sure I made this clear but don't slap on too much time wasting early. Something to be applied later in the game.  Also, build your strategy but don't be afraid to change it slightly whilst during the game. It's changing your tactic outside the game (which the players will need to relearn) which can be problematic.  Adjusting your tactic during the game is perfectly fine.  Examples:   Can't get hold of the ball.   Drop deeper (defensive line) and make the opposition commit men forward making it easier for you to break.   Weaker team playing well.   You've the ball and are playing well. Take it off counter and put it on standard or control.  Anyway, I'll leave it there or I'll be there all night.  GL."

footballmanagergames,3da9me,deathenvoymufc,2,Tue Jul 14 21:49:51 2015 UTC,"Well to start with, you have 6 players on Attack duty, 2 on support and only 2 on defence. Highly unbalanced.  For a counter attacking team you need at least 1 or 2 midfielders with a defensive mindset (BWM, CM(d), DLP etc) and pace up top. I tend to go with a 4123 with an anchor man and quick attacking wingers and 'pass into space'. Draw the opposition onto you then exploit the space left in the channels behind the fullbacks."
footballmanagergames,3da9me,TheDInho510,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:45:55 2015 UTC,"That tactic is fine for me what im using, im asking for a new one to use for away games  But thanks mate I should of probably clarified I'll have a go of your suggestions"
footballmanagergames,3da9me,Blueelt,2,Tue Jul 14 20:50:59 2015 UTC,"You need not create and entirely new tactic for away games, just a few changes should be fine but I guess it could be too many changes to make before every match so just make a copy of the tactic and make the changes. Change your wing backs to full backs on support, put a DM in front of your defense as ball winning midfielder on defend, a DLP on defend in front of him and change coutinho to an attacking midfielder. Put both wingers on support. For instructions, try more direct passing, run at defense, higher tempo, more closing down, exploit the flanks, look for overlap, stop GK short throws, be more disciplined. Change mentality to counter and team shape to structured. This is what worked for, managed to get 4th with Crystal Palace in the first year."
footballmanagergames,3dbh4m,larkin2010,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:52:52 2015 UTC,"I would probably either put the two DM as fullbacks or put the wingers a bit Down, your sides look extremely voulnerable"
footballmanagergames,3dbh4m,Evaldinho,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:57:44 2015 UTC,"I feel like retaining possession isn't the best choice if movement when you have two inside forwards, a complete forward, and a poacher. Instead try a more direct approach. Also play with just one center back, make the other two left and right backs, or else you'll see a lot of assists coming down your flanks. And I don't know whether two DMs works or if they just impede each other, I would keep an eye on that."
footballmanagergames,3dbh4m,BIiteum,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:11:58 2015 UTC,"I would recommend changing the inside forwards to wingers on support and your bbm to a roaming playmaker/DLP/AP and maybe change one of the DMs to HB. For the instructions, try more direct passing, exploit the flanks, look for overlap and higher tempo. It might help if you changed your mentality to counter and team shape to structured. Run at defense might also be a good option since you have really good wingers and strikers. Not sure about this but you could try changing you CF to DLF and your poacher to AF"

footballmanagergames,3d65p5,joethesaint,8,Tue Jul 14 12:33:54 2015 UTC,"In addition to the whole pre-tournament friendlies point, rotation is expected when you're playing games as regularly as you do in the WC, and all other teams are in the same boat. You shouldn't be at a disadvantage."
footballmanagergames,3d65p5,weakpotatoe,3,Mon Jul 13 21:38:14 2015 UTC,"I can't help but feel disadvantaged when i'm Ukraine and I need my full strength team to challenge the best teams in the WC. I did get an easy group draw though; Uruguay, Qatar & Costa Rica.   Full strength against Uruguay, won 4-2. Rotated against Qatar 1-1. Rotated again to half-strength against Costa Rica 2-2. So I had to bring on my best players in both 'rotated' games as they were too tight to risk letting in a late goal. Then I met Italy in the 2nd round and the above screenie is their fitness."

footballmanagergames,3d65p5,hi_im_a_lurker,3,Tue Jul 14 12:32:07 2015 UTC,Well obviously you're to keep using the same players game after game so that when they go back to their team they're all injured ensuring a terrible start to the season and a near sacking for the manager.
footballmanagergames,3d65p5,rowrow-,5,Tue Jul 14 04:45:36 2015 UTC,"What's happening in game is that the player's ""jaded"" stat is getting too high. This can be thought of as long-term fatigue from the season and will especially affect ""key players"" of club sides that start almost every game. Hence, because it's long-term and mostly dependent on games, it's rather difficult to combat it effectively, especially given the win at all costs knockout nature of the World Cup. Your best bet is to rotate more during the group stages, especially if you can manage to qualify early (recall Spain's third game of the 2010 WC where they rotated the entire squad)."
footballmanagergames,3d65p5,ynwa-mike,2,Tue Jul 14 08:12:01 2015 UTC,"I think to ease the 'rst' box is to literally rest the player for atleast a week. Which I can't do at the WC, and certainly can't rest 18 of my 23 man squad hah.   I was hoping for a no pressure final group match like you say, but I needed at least a draw with Costa Rica. I was 0-2 down after 60 minutes, so had to bring on my key players and pinched it back to 2-2 in the final 10 minutes."

I was getting tired of fm before trying to play timeskip save, but now i am managing Aston Villa in my 4th season (took the club in championship in 2052). Interesting to see how clubs change with time, which teams dominate europe, how different players become legends for different clubs. In my timeskip i spent 2 seasons with Arsenal after Wenger retired in 2017, won 2 PL titles and one CL, retired and Arsenal went to dominate 2020s heavily, won something like 8 PLs in a row. All this while struggling in europe, where Milan (btw Milan won serie A in all seasons from 2014 to 2054 except for 7: 3 Crotone (Giovinco who won the first one managing Crotone went to become manager and legend for Milan), 2 Sampdoria, 2 Livorno and 1 Napoli) and Dortmund dominated.  Trying to win in a league where Reading won CL and 3 PLs in 40s, while Plymouth and Sheffield Utd with their Oil rich daddies try to get into CL and Liverpool and Everton balance between championship and PL is pretty funny and very refreshing."

footballmanagergames,3d45w7,Hippopottermus,17,Mon Jul 13 11:36:29 2015 UTC,"This is quite common though IRL when strikers age, they tend to drop back and become midfielders or defenders.  Likewise defenders tend to be decent up-top if you play a long-ball style of play, or plenty of crosses, due to their heading attributes.  Teams use unorthadox strikers all the time when they need to snatch a goal late on, chuck the big lad up top and hope for the best.  A CB who is a good winger though, that's a strange one."

footballmanagergames,3d8s57,Cryptohaas,3,Tue Jul 14 11:48:14 2015 UTC,"On my Arsenal save, it took me a while to get rid of the dead weight (i.e. Diaby, Flamini, Podolski, etc.), the advice is to just persevere and maybe lowering the asking price, even beyond market value (depending on the value itself), as the likes of Diaby and Flamini won't be particularly popular with other clubs.   As for youth integration, throwing Calum Chambers in the deep-end has yielded great results for me, as he is now a world-class right back after 2 seasons already. Other talented youngsters to look out for are Dan Crowley and Serge Gnabry. The problem is that their favored positions are immensely stacked in the starting Arsenal team. As it will be for more positions in the beginning. The general idea behind youth incorporation is letting young players play in less 'important' matches, while simultaneously improving youth facilities and training. As Arsenal has a huge warchest, improving this should be easy.   In any case, winning the league (and more) is very possible with the 'vanilla' arsenal starter team, although you might concede more than you'd like, due to your somewhat suspect defence (especially left back, where your options are limited) and the composition of the team itself. You'll find yourself forced to played a 4-2-3-1 or something similar to accomodate most of your talented midfielders. An alternative is bringing in a good DM, such as Lucas Romero or one of the Bender Bro's, and going for a 4-3-3 with a dedicated DM. However, this means playing without a central attacking midfielder/advanced playmaker, meaning that there is no place for Ozil in this formation.  As for keepers, I've been quite content with Sczcnesy, but bought Scuffet anyway in the second season, he's looking good and is still young so plenty of time to develop.  Also, if you start winning trophies in the first season already, your wage budget and transfer budget will increase to ludicrous amounts I've noticed. I have over 6 million left in available wage budget while having 108 million left in the transfer budget without feeling the need to improve my team anywhere. In short, money should not be an issue.  Good luck with your save!"
footballmanagergames,3d8s57,Really_Interesting,3,Tue Jul 14 13:22:09 2015 UTC,"Also for the youth have a look at Zelalem, he is a beast( at least in Fm2014).  I always have at least one or two youth players on the bench in quite big matches (ie. Liverpool, Tot in the league etc, but not in very important ones where I stack the bench with my best players if I can) and put them on near the 60/70th min mark. As for the big names (Arteta, etc) you could ask them to become a coach because you might get more offers for them? (Arteta is a great tactical coach in my save) but otherwise you might have to sell them under their value. Of course try Scuffet, etc for a great goalie, but otherwise Scz does very well for me and I bought in Koen Casteels who turns into a very  very good goalkeeper."

footballmanagergames,3d8s57,Wallygoblin,2,Tue Jul 14 12:36:54 2015 UTC,"For the goalkeeper I would recommend Maxym Koval or Timo Horn. Horn is good for me and he has a release clause at £6.75m only so cheap and worth that money and he has time to grow as well, being 21 years old only. Szczesny does not turn into a world-beater but he is a solid option to keep.   Diaby and Podolski are tough ones to get rid off so I usually just have them in the reserves, trying to sell them every transfer window until they are relased on a free. Not that much of a big deal for me. If you want to you can also cash in on Walcott granted you have given him playing time after his injury. I always want to keep Oxlade as my first choice on the right wing since I believe he is a better all-round player and you can get some nice cash dollahs for Walcott one-two seasons in."

footballmanagergames,3d54of,KingSnakeThe1st,2,Tue Jul 14 20:10:24 2015 UTC,"Hey. Sorry for the late repay. Actually, it was my first season at City after four years at Inter and two years at Bayern. So City had already bought a vast amount of those players.  I brought in Depay, who I had worked with at Bayen, for £46mil. A lot of money, but he is absolutely worth it. Ballon d'Or three years in a row (two of which I trained him). I think you can get him a the start of a save for 20-25 mil. He is one of the best talents in FM15.  I also brought in Kovacic for £40 mil. Little expensive, but I had worked with him at Inter, and I am one of his favorite persons, so I wanted to get him on the team sheet.   Lastly Ramos at 34 years old for £4.5 mil. Cheap, but he still had good psychical stats for a 34 year old, and of course, fantastic mental stats."

footballmanagergames,3d6pmc,LiquidEnvy,3,Mon Jul 13 23:16:40 2015 UTC,"I had it working to an extent. I played 5 at the back including a sweeper and my attacking consisted on a right inside forward and a poacher. My average possession was around 46% and I finished 3rd in the Prem.   If the issue is counter attacks you may be playing the wrong shape for it to work, try defending deeper and using counter as your mentality. If you have a lot of players forward there isn't much point making aggressive low percentage passes as you could almost definitely play a shorter pass and find a better position that way."
footballmanagergames,3d6pmc,SirArchieCartwheeler,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:24:23 2015 UTC,"It really depends on how you have your players and system set up. Most counter attacks develop because there isn't enough pressure exerted by your forwards and midfielders which causes your back four or five to get caught out. Look at what happens when you lose the ball and see how many players are caught high up the pitch. I use a 4-3-3 DM with direct passing on Control, it's my preferred strategy when I'm matched up against weaker sides (I play as Olympique Marseille) and I see lots of switches in play and high tempo passing that usually results in goals.   Try to open up your mind and watch some games on comprehensive or full match highlights and look at how your system matches up against theirs. See if your leaving yourself exposed when you push up the pitch. Then look at your players and see if they have the attributes to do what you want them to do. Especially the midfielders, as they need to exert pressure on the opposition constantly if you're pressing high up the pitch."

I started the home leg with an overload tactic, Playing route one football. 5-0 in the return leg, Messi and Neymar were totally useless (I also turned on the offisde trap which seems to work really well).

footballmanagergames,3d2ef3,Feicarsinn,21,Mon Jul 13 18:50:11 2015 UTC,The larger Italian sides often have huge numbers of players out on loan and tied up in part ownership deals.

footballmanagergames,3d6unu,VictorAnichebe,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:55:53 2015 UTC,"Is this the real Victor Anichebe?  Anyway, depending on your players on formation etc.  I tend to switch between more direct passing, run at defence + pass into space, whilst remaining extra disciplined. This way I hope to smash a counter attack style game with my wingers/forwards to snatch a goal or two."

I tried a new tactic for away matches with a counter attacking based, structured and disciplined 4-4-1-1 and it has done fairly well.  I'll try using pass into space and run at defense as they'd suit that formation.  Thanks for the help :)"
footballmanagergames,3d5xcu,takethecake88,2,Mon Jul 13 19:51:37 2015 UTC,"Which formation/system are you using most often? Which formation suits your players the best? I have three versions of a 4-1-2-2-1 wide DM on control, standard, and defensive that I switch between regularly. Each one is tailored to the players I have at my disposal and all give me the defensive solidarity that I pride my teams on having. I did consider switching to a 4-2-3-1 so I could maybe play a bit quicker on the break, but all in all my system is working well for me at present so I decided to stick with what I started out with.   So all in all it depends on 1. What formation best suits your players 2. Whether you can still remain defensive solid against those teams with good CAMs using the other formations, since you can make 4231s and 442s defensive as well with the right setup and player attributes 3. Going with your gut since you're the manager!  For me personally, I would have 2 tactics using the same formation, with slight variations in mentality and shouts to give my team a bit more versatility while still retaining their best formation. So for example my Standard 41221 is just my Control 41221 dropped back a little bit and with a bit less closing down so as to maintain shape.  Hope this helped!"

And you say you've made some changes alread; I'm not going to study it all but I would like to help you with some remarks based on your original post. The most important tips:  -I think you overload the players with instructions. 16 is a lot! I would go back to +/- 8.  -Your wing backs are offensive and the 2 remaining defenders have no cover from the midfield. That is suicide. Just look at how teams play in real life. No team plays this offensive. You could put the wing backs in a 'support' role and let one midfielder play close to his defense (I think you've changed that already).  -2 CM players on 'attack' is probably to much as well. Try 1 on attack, 1 on support and 1 on defense.  -Maybe you should play Pelle as a targetman but AF could work as well.  -I wouldn't play with 2 Inside Forwards. Pelle needs crosses and the IF's could be in the way of the attacking midfielder if they cut inside the whole time. Maybe make one IF, with the best cross, a winger (on support or attack)."
footballmanagergames,3d4kp2,RH-Ajax,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:04:46 2015 UTC,"Hi! Thanks for the reply, I appreciate the comments as I'm very new   I think you overload the players with instructions. 16 is a lot! I would go back to +/- 8.   It is a lot but why is this a bad thing? I figured it might make it harder to learn but they seem ""accomplished"" with it fairly quick, do they struggle to follow them when there's too many?   Your wing backs are offensive and the 2 remaining defenders have no cover from the midfield. That is suicide. Just look at how teams play in real life. No team plays this offensive. You could put the wing backs in a 'support' role and let one midfielder play close to his defense (I think you've changed that already).   Yes this is the biggest mistake I think this tactic has, I changed two of the CMs to BWM(D) and CM(S) to try to balance it out but I haven't changed the CWBs, do you think this is enough? I'll see how my goal record is after a month or two.   2 CM players on 'attack' is probably to much as well. Try 1 on attack, 1 on support and 1 on defense.   Ahh! This is what I chose! Great minds think alike eh?   I wouldn't play with 2 Inside Forwards. Pelle needs crosses and the IF's could be in the way of the attacking midfielder if they cut inside the whole time. Maybe make one IF, with the best cross, a winger (on support or attack).   Ahh this is the stuff I need to learn! Crosses are winger play and IFs cut inside and play like narrow attacking mids, right! Cheers for that  Also I ended up scrapping IFs alltogether to play a front narrow 3 with Pelle (AF) Mane (F9) and a DLF which I think I started training Tadic to play. Thoughts?"
footballmanagergames,3d4kp2,RH-Ajax,2,Mon Jul 13 16:10:40 2015 UTC,"I don't know how to respond to each point like you did so I'm just doing it like this, haha.  -Well; the instructions are not just a lot to learn/do/remember/train, a lot of them don't really match. High tempo is not great with short passing. Also: do you want short passing with an attack/team like this?That's just an example. Maybe take a good look at what you want with the team and what they can do.  -I'm not sure if that's enough. Maybe it won't be against teams with wingers. But it could work.  -I'm not sure about Tadic being a good Deep Lying Forward. Same goes for Mane as a false 9.. I don't think they have the qualities to do that very well. But I don't have the stats here. If their qualities are good for those roles, they might do a good job. But it could take months or maybe a whole season for them to learn it... You could be fired by then, haha. Maybe don't make it to complicated and play them in a role they are good/familiar with."
footballmanagergames,3d4kp2,RH-Ajax,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:40:05 2015 UTC,"Ahh the instructions conflict? That makes sense, I guess I don't really know if I want short passing or high tempo.. Ill try both seperately?  Mane has a ""Good"" rating at False 9, is this not a good thing to base it off? And yeah Tadic isnt great but this formation Ive gone to doesnt have wide attackers so he's useless otherwise"
footballmanagergames,3d4kp2,ThatVillaDude,3,Mon Jul 13 16:47:52 2015 UTC,"Ghehe, yeah, maybe just delete the whole instruction thing and start over. Maybe no 'high tempo' and no 'short passing'  ;)  Both not great for this team, I think.  And I really think you should put Tadic on the wing: his cross is amazing (and so is his dribble). He will give a lot of assists on Pelle. Mane can play on the other wing as what ever (inside forward, winger, raumdeuter) or maybe another player is better.  You'll have to figure it out mate! Good luck!"
footballmanagergames,3d4kp2,RH-Ajax,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:59:33 2015 UTC,"In my experience, high tempo, short passing and aggressive play go together really well if you have a top-tier team and a training focus on tactics (with a bit of attacking and ball control). It's still a good idea to have a couple of creative attackers set to pass more direct. Not advisable in your first season at a club, although Southampton have the quality to pull it off against some of the smaller teams in the Premier League."

Whether you choose to make this person a proper dm or just change a centre midfielders role to ball winning midfielder you should defiantly do at least one. It should help you keep the ball a little more and get it back quicker when you lose it. You might want to get a second opinion though because there s large chance I'm talking rubbish.

footballmanagergames,3d4kp2,usus789,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:03:47 2015 UTC,No problem also you mentioned that you weren't getting lots of possession playing at a higher tempo will make your team give away possession more often. I've never played with wing backs but I have always thought the look for overlap instruction was built for them. Also it seems to me you are looking to play quite narrow yet you are using wing backs I'm not sure that's a good thing. Just to remind this advice could be utter rubbish.
footballmanagergames,3d4kp2,ThatVillaDude,2,Mon Jul 13 15:23:44 2015 UTC,"Are you sure about those 2 CM(A)? what the attack duty does is make them run to the box while leaving so much space that only your CM(D) will cover, leaving you effectively with 3 or 4 people defending an attack which most probably will launch to the flanks leaving you exposed, because your CWB (A) will to up to the byline and will make them exposed at the back.  When creating a tactic you need balance in the Defensive and Offensive Phase, which are joint by the Transition Phase, Watch the replays and see how your team acts when losing the ball."

I'd been promoted in the first season from the Conference North to the Conference Premier and there I spent a season consolidating and did not get promoted. I did wreck the cups but that's a story for another day.  The season of consolidation did Gateshead the world of good because the following season they were champions. The season after Gateshead were promoted via the playoffs to league 1.  I eventually abandoned the save because I lost the League 1 playoffs two years running and I was dejected. I'll remember that till the day I die. The club had grown so quickly I had overspent on wage and so the club were loosing money and not gaining. As such the club would never have been able to improve the stadium and/or facilities. So keep in mind that finances are everything and you should keep them in mind first of all.  Consider that a cautionary tale. Climbing quickly is fine but make sure you take the wages with you.  TL:DR - Yep, you can go straight up if your team is good enough.

footballmanagergames,3d4cz7,weakpotatoe,2,Mon Jul 13 15:13:08 2015 UTC,The only thing I've changed when going up the division's is maybe my tactics based on what players I can get and the sheer amount of loans I attempt. Keeping the wage budget as low as possible is the key to LLM. If you can field a decent enough team for less than what everyone else has then you are golden. Just remember even though the board allots you x amount of wages doesn't mean you should use it all. I learned that one the hard way
footballmanagergames,3d4cz7,nRvGRiM,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:45:05 2015 UTC,"I try to not spend what I have available because I've been caught out before and suffered from it.   I won the conference last season playing attacking football in the first half and standard/control in the second half of the season, but I'm not overly confident that this will work against a better standard of team in league 2."
footballmanagergames,3d4cz7,weakpotatoe,2,Mon Jul 13 15:57:04 2015 UTC,"The gap in play isn't big enough. You may not get instantly promoted but you can hold in league 2 with a good tactic and good loanees. Remember you can play 5 at once, which can easily raise the quality in your side if you find the right ones.  This is of course if you still have your conference players. Remember to check league 2 relegated teams to see if they lost any decent players."
footballmanagergames,3d4cz7,nRvGRiM,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:05:01 2015 UTC,"I've got a couple really good loan signings in but there really isn't anyone else around at the moment that would improve my team in the positions I need it. And my parent club isn't exactly helpful, either.   In regards to frees, again, I've got a few first teamers and some back ups for depth but there isn't anything around that will improve me to the quality I need."
footballmanagergames,3d4cz7,weakpotatoe,3,Mon Jul 13 16:09:48 2015 UTC,Yep then just aim for mid table and be pleasantly surprised if any better. You can probably make a playoff push if you can at least play consistently against teams that have equal or lesser talent than you.
footballmanagergames,3d4cz7,nRvGRiM,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:11:27 2015 UTC,this was literally impossible to do for me going from south to conference
footballmanagergames,3d4cz7,weakpotatoe,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:27:37 2015 UTC,In 13 I managed straight promotions to the championship by just constantly looking out for transferred players. Lots of young talent And a few mercenaries got me there. Getting from championship to the premiership is a whole different story however. The jump in quality between the top 3 divisions is definitely noticeable
footballmanagergames,3d4cz7,conorblayney,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:47:14 2015 UTC,i found it easier to jump form championship to prem but credit to you if you got straight promotions. I think me picking pred. 20th / 21st with worst finances probably has sth to do with me not being able to make double jumps

I've read that there are more world-class regens in 15, but I have no idea if that's true.

Guy started for the national team at the age of 16. Got him for a measly 9milluon when I knew he'd be loads better.
footballmanagergames,3d2zdz,weakpotatoe,2,Mon Jul 13 16:08:37 2015 UTC,Youth league as in like England under 21s or like the Vanarama conference or like just reserve teams?

FM15 gens seem to be OP (overpowered) at a younger age compared to previous versions, and as OP (original poster) has already said he tutored the player - tutoring can bring on some insane development in a young gen with the correct personality and attributes to develop quickly. This is an extreme example granted, but it's not like the game is coded so that this kind of development is impossible."

footballmanagergames,3d1o5u,erdemcan,0,Mon Jul 13 12:40:35 2015 UTC,"Well no, he said it suddenly increased - not randomly increased. It suddenly went from 15 to 20, way more likely to be from tutoring. You're confusing 'suddenly' with 'unexpectedly'"
footballmanagergames,3d1o5u,brainwrinkled,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:54:02 2015 UTC,"That's not entirely true either. I've found with a young enough tutee and a good enough tutor, some attributes really can shoot up.

He told me his current club (Juventus) were playing continental football already.   He seemed to forget he was only on loan there from 11th place Udinese.

footballmanagergames,3d2rn6,Stigface,4,Mon Jul 13 02:47:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it took me a while to muster up the patience to play this way.

footballmanagergames,3d2rn6,Stigface,3,Mon Jul 13 02:53:18 2015 UTC,Do you think you get better results based on this method of play? I barely research the opposition at all so probably would do better if I took more time.
footballmanagergames,3d2rn6,GfxJG,9,Mon Jul 13 02:56:56 2015 UTC,"Definitely, one of the reasons I do this is so I know my enemy. ""If you know your enemy and yourself, you'll know the outcome of 1000 battles"" or something like that from Sun Tzu  If I'm up against a weaker side (I play as OM in France) I know that their main threat is going to be through the counter attack, so when I research their players, I look to see who in their attack will pose me the most threat with pace, skill, strength, etc. Once I know that, I use opposition instructions to try and limit their influence on the game.  Same goes for my own players. When I first looked at the OM's squad, I realized that they have a lot of hard working, determined players, so I based my tactic around a hardworking center midfield trio who cover tons of ground on both ends of the pitch.  Results have been really good, I'm 2nd in the league behind PSG and my defense is rock solid, we're consistently keeping clean sheets (bad for finances though, goddamn bonuses lol).  Overall though, it is just a game so no need to feel like you should play this way."
footballmanagergames,3d2rn6,ClandestineMovah,2,Mon Jul 13 03:11:05 2015 UTC,"I could never do that. Hell, I don't even watch my matches, I use the ""Instant Result"" function. But that's just me, I mainly play the game for squad management, not tactical management."

Careful what you wish for haha
footballmanagergames,3d2rn6,ClandestineMovah,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:25:26 2015 UTC,It really depends on the club I'm managing. If the team I'm managing are one of the stronger in the league then I really want to up the tempo because I think it makes it harder for the team to regain their shape.

footballmanagergames,3d1890,bayerleverkusen,18,Sun Jul 12 18:01:59 2015 UTC,"Get a senior player in a similar position to tutor him, that will almost definitely help with his mental traits. Regens are always really raw, especially at that age. You can make them anything you want them to be if you use their potential wisely. In general there are a few thing you should always have/do with wonderkids to make sure they carry on developing rapidly;  Staff - Make sure you get the foundations set, you're given a maximum number of personnel for a reason, make sure the staff room is full. Terminate the contracts of those that aren't going to help you on the training pitch and replace them with those that will. You can find loads of lists online of great staff for each and every role, not to forget the odd amazing regen coach you can snap up when they're unknown. It's all well and good hiring great coaches, but make sure they're good at working with youth, that's the key to great development. (If you can, upgrade the facilities too)  Under 18s/21s/Reserves - If he's not featuring all the time in your team, don't be afraid to let him play for the youth setups. It helps keep him fit and he will continue to develop, albeit not at the same rate as first team. I always find unless a team has good facilities or play at a certain level, loan deals rarely improve the player.   Positional development - How are you going to play him? How do you want him to turn out? Let the position guide at the side help you, it'll highlight the key attributes, and shows you what to train him individually for. Listen to your coaches too, they can be quite helpful in their recommendations (although sometimes a lesser coach will suggest something detrimental to a player). If they're unhappy with their workload of training, it will stagnate, so keep an eye on their happiness.   A case in point to a player similar to this on my save was Diego Poyet, he has okay stats but not exactly a World beater at the beginning. You have the choice of throwing them in at the deep end and taking the hit of a few bad results but a player who develops faster, or slowly rotating them into easier games for your starter. European games (group stage), Cup games etc are perfect for blooding youngsters, friendly season is perfect for seeing how they play.   An important sidenote at the end. Determination. If they have low determination you'll struggle to see big improvements, and coupled with a high work-rate, they should apply themselves in training too. Edit; thanks to Ezekiiel for bringing to my attention that determination is pretty rubbish in terms of effecting training effort, http://www.footballmanagerstory.com/football-manager-myth-buster-determination-work-rate/ this shows up more general points too.  Hope this wasn't too long winded and is of some help."
footballmanagergames,3d1890,fenntastic,2,Sun Jul 12 19:15:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the insight. Very, very thorough."
footballmanagergames,3d1890,fenntastic,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:17:35 2015 UTC,"That's alright, a more general comment with player development, don't be afraid to terminate the contracts of those that'll never make the cut. Of course, make sure you still have enough numbers to make a team, but you usually find you'll have seven centre backs with only two/three that'll go on to be even conference quality. It helps save you money on your contracts and lets the coaches focus away from the deadringers."
footballmanagergames,3d1890,Telcar,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:24:08 2015 UTC,do you tutor on or off the pitch? Also f. ex. If you have a professional youngster is it worthwhile to have him tutored by a senior player that has an ambitious (read: worse) personality?
footballmanagergames,3d1890,fenntastic,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:06:16 2015 UTC,"Both ambition and professionalism are great things to have in a tutor, it's important (but not essential) to make sure that the tutor and the younger player have similar personalities to ensure the relationship works. If the tutor has bad personality traits, or lower personality traits than the tuttee, they will bring down the younger player to their level. Be wary to not let poor tutors ruin a young player, a great tutor can also work wonders. In my save, Biglia was a superb tutor, he got along with most players and always made them better players on and off the pitch."
footballmanagergames,3d1890,Telcar,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:59:37 2015 UTC,"so to improve personality you can use whatever player you want regardless of position?   Also, you can't always know which players are professional and ambitious, the coaches don't tell you the whole story, how do you identify good tutors?"
footballmanagergames,3d1890,Ezekiiel,2,Mon Jul 13 17:06:03 2015 UTC,"Good points, but determination being a factor in regen development is a huge myth that was proven a while ago."

Any thoughts about how to fix this?"
footballmanagergames,3d1890,fenntastic,2,Sun Jul 12 21:53:28 2015 UTC,"If your player is already in the first team and has a team role higher than rotation, they cannot be tutored at all. If you go directly into the players development/ training screen from his attributes profile, you should see a list of first-team players that'll be able to tutor him. If the two players get on well then the whole process should last 180 days."

footballmanagergames,3d1890,obgynkenobi,4,Sun Jul 12 23:03:25 2015 UTC,"I will echo some other stuff that has been said but this is my youth development advice.  Never loan them out. You should have better facilities and coaches than whatever team you loan them too plus you cannot tutor them. The players I loan out are 2-3 star potential players that I want to get off the wage bill and I want them to do well in a lower league so I can sell them. Plus if you bought them that year away does not count towards making them club trained for the CL.  I always train them for a tactical role not a particular stat. Training for a stat is painfully slow and I would rather they be well rounded. For attacking players I either train them as Advanced Playmaker or complete forward because they tend to be the most balanced roles. DM I train a DLP, CD as BPD and FB as CBW.  Tutoring is a big plus BUT you have to be careful. If your tutor has lower Determination you can lowed your regen's Determination as a result. If you ask them to ""teach them off the field"" they will get the mental attributes of the tutor. If you ask them ""to improve their game"" they will pick up the players Favored Moves. I rarely pick improve their game because favored moves override your tactical instructions and use up ability points.   Play them as much as possible. Cup games and games you are ahead or games against bad teams etc. I try not to use more than 1-2 youth players in a particular game even against bad teams because you can drop points or get knocked out of cup competitions.  I never train favored moves. See above why.   I keep my youth teams lean so the good ones get attention from coaches. I do not care if they win the U21 or U18 games. In Spain it's a bit different I do not want my B team to get relegated too low.   Injuries can destroy careers. I try not to overplay or overtrain young players. If they are amazing I would rather they get 5 starts and 15 sub appearances with my first team rather than play 25 90 min games with the u21 and break a leg."

The more leagues you load the more players in the database and having lots of players can slow your game down (requires extra processing power).  You will need load England and the English championship as playable. You should also load the premier league and league one incase you get promoted/relegated.  Leading Spain will mean the games in Spain will will be simulated and you can watch see their scores or even watch them.  Also did you try googling first? I googled ""football manager loading leagues"" and got this article which seems to explain it reasonable well. Also why did you ask a very similar question again within half an hour?"
footballmanagergames,3d0eut,Jtsrobin,3,Sun Jul 12 13:15:56 2015 UTC,"No.  It's a bit of a cliché but it's also true. The saying goes like 'Some players need an arm around the shoulder and some need a kick up the backside'  If you really want to go into insane depth (and I don't) then you would note your players personality and specifically, how he responds to interactions.  For example: James Milner would be one who would respond better to a kick up the backside because he's a work horse.  TL:DR Some players respect a more authoritarian approach."

With his freakish speed what you can do is play with a much higher defensive line if you have other defenders with decent speed too."

footballmanagergames,3d09fp,Treskol,8,Sun Jul 12 11:59:58 2015 UTC,"I'd 100% keep him as a full back, he's got pretty much perfect stats for what I look for. Tackling, Marking, Positioning, Acceleration, Work Rate all very good.  Any crossing or passing in double digits is usually good enough for me as I prefer my full backs to be strong defensively above all else. And I've had full backs with only 10 crossing get at least 10 assists a season, so am never that fussed about it being particularly high.  Just my 2 cents, perhaps you play differently, but strong full backs like this are hard to come by!"
footballmanagergames,3d09fp,covmatty1,3,Sun Jul 12 12:44:47 2015 UTC,"I would've initially said really push him into being a wing back as he could be awesome at that but if your keen on him playing centre back, he can play ball playing centre back if you train his passing at bit more. For me though his pace means I would get him to run up and down the left wing in some capacity."

footballmanagergames,3d0t04,RH-Ajax,2,Sun Jul 12 19:24:55 2015 UTC,"preseason untick rest days and match prep all the way off switch to fitness at high for 3 weeks maybe a month depending on when your friendlies start, once your friendlies start let some match training creep in the day of and the day before, switch focus to team cohesion if you have a lot of new signings or balanced or whatever you need to focus on.    the fitness is to get the lead out really and the friendlies will let your key players get match fit, they don't need breaks since the games don't matter and you have unlimited subs.  around the last 2 weeks of friendlies increase match training to whatever your comfortable with and leave it on tactics only until they are fluid, once all the friendlies are done then you can give them rest days before and after."
footballmanagergames,3d0t04,RH-Ajax,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:19:42 2015 UTC,"Once your team is at full or near full tactical understanding, there's no reason to keep it up unless you are doing specific pre-match training for an opponent. I drop it to half for most of a season."

footballmanagergames,3d0sc9,Ghost51,4,Sun Jul 12 15:43:28 2015 UTC,"Even if your fixtures don't look like too much to complain about, we've all been there quite a few times and it is infuriating. Your wonderkid is left marked out a game by Titus Bramble, your composed centre-back goes diving through the back of Carlton Cole, your magician in midfield keeps passing the ball into no-mans land etc etc. It may seem like the game's against you, it's not. Until FM14/15 you could simply put out the same 11 or so players, in the same formation, week in, week out, and do very well every season, but now it's not the case at all. This year squad rotation is more important than ever before, and it's increasingly linked to morale. You need two 11s, two teams you're capable of fielding at any time and being confident of victory, at a team like Man United this is easy. What's not so easy is making sure those players are fit and mentally ready to slot into those games, you need to ensure morale stays high. How do you do this? Anyway necessary; individual chats, making sure they're happy with training, contract negotiations. The happier a player, the better a player is.   This is linked directly to team talks, press conferences and touchline instructions. During games keep an eye out for the teams morale at all times, don't let their heads go down. If you have a professional side they can and will take criticism, there's always one player that seems disheartened after you really get into them but fuck him. 1-0 at half time to Sunderland? Let your team know it's not acceptable, (aggressive) ""What was that? Do you want to win this game at all you bunch of shitheads?"" etc. Avoid being over confident in team talks and press conferences, it lulls the players into a false sense of security, they don't put in the proverbial Our 'arrys ""110%"".  Doubtful team talks work, especially with determined players, they will want to prove you wrong. Players with higher morale on the bench will do the business on the pitch, sub them on and see them shine. When they go on, tell them they can make the difference, they usually go out there and do the job you need.  The AI in FM14/15 is much better than in years previous, it will adjust to your tactic, so it's best to change it up every now and again. They usually want to frustrate you and hit you on the break, don't allow them. Drop a little deeper, be a little less expressive, be wary of the long ball etc. The opposition just like you has prepared for the match, Chelsea will come and play YOU at YOUR game, lesser teams will not. Remember just last season when Leicester pulled off the 'great escape' in the Premiership? Case and point my beloved West Ham, looking comfortable and in control against Leicester, the games 1-1 and in the balance. The second half the players come and play for their lives, they win 2-1, this will happen in FM. Players fighting relegation? They will give their absolute all. It's all about morale my friend."

Best place to start with reading: Guide to FM Loads of information there, worth reading for any FM player.  Hard to give any hints without knowing your previous experience with football management games, your general knowledge of football, team you're planning to manage etc etc  Tactics that work the best? Really personal preference thing, I prefer to play with a single striker, mostly. Others are the exact opposite and always love to have at least 2 strikers. Edit: and that's just the formation, could go on for days with instructions.  So some random advice, try playing with a team that you know or with some big team to get a hang of things. Maybe download other people's tactics and try to figure out what makes them work, and try to build your own tactics from them. Lower league team with little money? Loan, loan, loan."

footballmanagergames,3d0ns0,ClandestineMovah,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:04:08 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest picking a big team with lots of resources to get used to the game. Once used to game, you can then branch out and use lower teams. For example, I've done a Chelsea save all year but I recently started a Nuremberg save and I'm having almost as much fun in Germany as I did in England.  If you choose a big team, sign loads of 'wonderkids', like Fierro, Romero, Zivkovic, Balanta, Tielemans etc, and you can develop them to create a team that can be a force for the future as well as now. For example, I signed Lucas Romero in my Chelsea save and he was still playing for me in 2030. Also, keep an eye out for regen days where you can pick up world class potential regens for peanuts.  When it comes to bits of advice, be prepared for shit player interactions. They're rather frequent and broken..."
footballmanagergames,3d0ns0,soluuloi,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:38:09 2015 UTC,"This will likely be one of the most complex games you've ever played. It's not really as simple as you might hope.  I'll address your points and add on some of the major pitfalls I made as a new manager to FM.   Any helpful tips or hints for me as a newbie?   Learn to understand the finances. FM is not a game where you play one season. Your measure of a successful manager is long term and for that you need to understand how to balance the books. Assign team talks to your assistant until you understand them.   Tactics that impress you and work the best for you?   Tactics are simply too complicated to discuss in short here. Use the wizard to help you. It'll hold your hand so you can make it through your first few seasons by that time you should have a slightly better understanding.  There are two main schools of thought when creating tactic.   Adapt your players to a formation you like to use. Adapt your tactics to make best use of the players you have.   Sooner or later you're going to need to use both schools of thought.    Any random advice you may have?   You're going to make a lot of mistakes so just accept that. Post questions here when you can. I (and many others) will be more than happy to answer any well worded questions. Pick a team which is expected to dominate the league. Most of us are ego-maniacs and want to dive right in and be 'the special one' but the truth is that's only going to make the game frustrating.  You're much better served to start with a team which is much stronger than the others as this will mean you'll have to mess up an awful lot to lose and be eventually sacked. Instead, with the strong team you'll eventually figure out where to refine your performances.  A team like Glasgow Rangers is a good choice."

footballmanagergames,3d0j76,ClandestineMovah,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:49:18 2015 UTC,"The problem might be the player but it might also be the agent.  Often when contract terms are rejected you're unable to offer new terms. Sometimes when contract terms are rejected the agent or player will not want to speak to the club again. Keep trying but be aware that the player will be approachable 6 months from contract end. It's sometimes better to cut your losses, sell the player and move on."
footballmanagergames,3d0j76,ClandestineMovah,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:50:55 2015 UTC,Maybe he is still transfer listed?
footballmanagergames,3d0dfb,jamielfc1994,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:55:22 2015 UTC,"Well unless you've said something to him which has really upset him (or his agent) then you should get an opportunity to talk to his agent again.  It's possible the agent has had previous interactions with you and simply hates your guts.  You will - most likely - get another opportunity before his contract expires but if he's in his last year it may be better to cash so you don't run the risk of losing him.  If keeping him is the priority and money isn't a problem then I'd wait for your opportunity and don't mess the agent, come in and accept the terms he wants but expect this to be very high since the agent clearly knows that bigger clubs are interested.  Another bit of advice would be to review the agent before you discuss terms. See if he is a patient agent or impatient. Reviewing previous interactions would be useful too."
footballmanagergames,3d0dfb,ClandestineMovah,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:55:13 2015 UTC,It's a new game and he had problems with PSV in real life so he's not spoke to me since the start of the game. Morale is superb though.
footballmanagergames,3d0b5f,lostplentysince,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:24:12 2015 UTC,"It's certainly an interesting tactic that has intrigued me quite a bit. But anyways let's dissect it.   First off, Wingbacks and Wingers don't really mix. They're both meant to offer needed width however this can lead to them occupying the same space which will leave you vulnerable elsewhere. So your solution here would be: A. Go to a 3 centreback formation with 3 CD. 2 on defend duty and the middle one on cover. Then change your W's to WM on support so they pitch in defensively. If you don't like that then: B. change your wingbacks to fullbacks just so they sit narrower.  Secondly, I think a HB is good because its basically another center back for your limited back line. A DLP on defend and an AP on Attack is creating gaps between your defense and midfield so to combat this move your DLP into midfield and change him to BBM.   I thinks that's pretty much if you have any questions just ask."
footballmanagergames,3d0b5f,Urbiscuit18,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:06:45 2015 UTC,The idea behind the wing-back winger combo was that we'd double up on the full back and peg the opposition wingers back having to deal with an aggressive full back. I've actually already switched them to full back duties too as we looked particularly vulnerable there. I'm reluctant to push the DLP further forward as I'll be left more vulnerable at the back. I did have him as a Regista before and I might revert to that. then for the AP I could switch him to support but still ask him to surge through the middle? The last change I was also thinking of was to have a F9 instead of a DLF so he drops in to the midfield to help out.   I'll admit I was looking at some of the Bielsa tactics and I quite like those ideas. I just think with a lower end championship team I'll get mullered if I try to play too aggressive

My last saved stayed 3 years, trying to fight against Paris was the best part. I think in 9 encounters I won twice (one in cup final and one in the league). I have done a QPR save for laughs, they have money despite poor financials, and paying way too much for some players."

footballmanagergames,3d09e3,Evaldinho,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:10:08 2015 UTC,It's a waste of time if you're in the EPL. I'm surprised you've opted for anyone off the trialist list because they're all incredibly poor for that standard.  The fact you found and developed a player who you eventually sold for 8m isn't saying a lot if you were an EPL team. Most of the players in your team should reach that value easily. Even in FM13.  In lower leagues most of the players on the list will be better than what you have.  Top tip: Go through the u18's of the EPL and Championship and scout them. When it comes to the end of January check your free transfer list and still those kids. Or wait until they're released.

footballmanagergames,3cxwb9,Predicted,3,Sat Jul 11 19:38:09 2015 UTC,"I've quite a bit of experience in this actually :)  About 15-20 seasons of it.  My present save started with me managing Newcastle United with Whitley Bay added (by way of the database editor) as an affiliate.   I promoted Whitley Bay (using Newcastle) from the 9th tier to the 6th tier by way of loans mainly, although I did buy some players from Whitley.   Ok, I've just reloaded my save to check the figures and decided it was easier to screenshot the purchases from Whitley Bay than explain them.  In 20/21 I became fucked off with the financial mismanagement of club and sacked the manager (by adding a manager) and added myself as a fresh manager.  That was after 'transferred' the remainder of Newcastle's funds to Whitley.  Screenies  Check the league rules and see what the limit of players are that can be loaned out. The limiting factor will be the willingness of players to move to a lower reputation club. You can improve the likelihood of players moving by offering to move them to the affiliate nearer to the end of the free transfer window. Not to be confused with the standard transfer window.  I don't know how Norwegian league rules differ from English league rules as I've never managed there."
footballmanagergames,3cxwb9,ClandestineMovah,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:45:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, but it isnt quite what im looking for. In norway you have three squads in your club, A team, 2nd team (in my case its named Hødd 2) and U19, the a team is what you play and the U 19 is in their own league, but some of the premier teams have their 2nd teams compete in the lowest playable league without possibility of getting promoted further since all 2nd teams exist in the league system, only most are outside of whats playable.  Now i have no idea how teams get promoted into this league, if its based on rng, what players you have in your second squad, reputation or what, but I would like to find out how to get my 2nd team out of the invisible leagues and into the active playable leagues."
footballmanagergames,3cxwb9,ClandestineMovah,2,Sun Jul 12 03:17:32 2015 UTC,"Ok, assuming I've understood you correctly then I don't think this is possible.  I'm going to speculate that the Norwegian system is similar that of Spain. Barcelona B cannot be promoted regardless of where they finish.  This removes any possibility of the two teams meeting in the league. That would raise issues of fairness as the lesser team could throw games in order to help the 1st team secure points.  Hopefully I've not misunderstood your point this time."
footballmanagergames,3cxwb9,ClandestineMovah,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:22:48 2015 UTC,"We're almos there :P  In norway the second teams are locked to be at least two tiers below the first teams, and since there are three playable tiers in FM the second teams can and do compete in the lowest tier playable tier if their main squad competes in the premiere division. Now I played as a team that starts in the second tier and therefore their 2nd team is in a league below what is simulated. So every year when the league finishes 16 new teams get pulled up from this pool of teams in the nonsimulated leagues, and i wanna find out how to get my second team promoted into the simulated league.  A sidenote, there are many 2nd teams that play in the lowest league allready, im just trying to join them,"
footballmanagergames,3cxwb9,ClandestineMovah,2,Sun Jul 12 03:36:45 2015 UTC,"We're almos there :P   Give me a break, it's late. I missed the simulated league bit.  To my knowledge there is no tangible way to effect that team since the league is not simulated. I've heard others on reddit/fm say that they are but I've seen no stats (in any league) for the games that I've played.  I've tried this in England and in Wales. I often loan players out to these non-simulated teams and they generate stats but there are no tables.  As you mentioned earlier it's either RNG or it'll be based off reputation. In that regard, aside using something like FMRTE there would be no way to make this work.  I'm happy to be corrected."
footballmanagergames,3cxwb9,ClandestineMovah,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:42:12 2015 UTC,"Ye ive checked around in FMRTE, and it seems that my second squad has 0 reputation, if i up it to a thousand before the season ends maybe it would impact the chances?"
footballmanagergames,3cxwb9,tancredinho,2,Sun Jul 12 03:44:02 2015 UTC,"There is a real chance it will but there is also no indication it will for certain.  I would change it and leave it for a couple of seasons. It'd also be wise to backup your save, just in case.  The reason I suggest two seasons as FM is 'funny' and often calculates changes to teams at odd times.  GL"

I'd need more information. What happens when you apply to loan from England or Italy?  Is the approach blocked or does the players agent break off the correspondence?  I'd suspect that you've insufficient reputation but Iceland's reputation within the game is fairly strong. They stand somewhere between the EPL, The Championship and League 1 by English standards and that's still quite strong on a global scale.

footballmanagergames,3cwhl1,materialist23,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:06:41 2015 UTC,I just want to expand a little on what the others have said.  Yep it's that option. The DOF will often take that role but you could assign it to a lot of other members of the club so it's not just the DOF.   The reason I dislike this is because with managing a small club I've often had to over-pay on wages and this means that when I come to sell a player the buying club often ask that I pay some of the wages even though they're buying. I hate this and always reject it. The DOF (or other staff member) who is selected will automatically agree to this and that's just poor business.  I don't hire DOF's and I've never used them. I do have staff selected in helping me loan/sell youngsters though. I loan young players a lot but I very rarely sell a young player as it makes more sense to sell him after you've trained him a little bit.  In that regard it can be helpful if you use the youth option but not the senior.

I recently signed one of the 2 defenders from Atlas and he cost me £1.5 million up front and £1 million over 48 months. He's already better than my current RB (Diekmeier) and I should be able to sell him on for a fortune. I missed him on the regen day because he signed a deal with Atlas but it didn't take long for him to join.  He's got better potential than the other guy, yet Club América want £30+ million for him."

footballmanagergames,3cuvwh,TheodoreP,8,Fri Jul 10 23:41:25 2015 UTC,"It's a cliche, but a tactic is never complete. Like in real life, your tactic(s) should always adapt to those you have around you, especially the specific qualities each player has. If you're playing in League Two, you can try (and most probably fail) to play a progressive false nine system with two wing backs, but without the players it's fruitless. Of course, as the seasons progress you can mold the team into your own image, your own style as it were. It's important to actually watch your games, especially when trying out a new tactic, it helps you to see where it is going right and where it's going wrong. Getting caught out behind too much? Try a deeper line. Playing a rigid defensive system? It's probably best not to allow your players to be that expressive. I cannot recommend enough looking at this article http://www.footballmanagerstory.com/fm-2015-tactics-guide-create-tactic/, it does all of this so much more justice than I ever possibly could. Hope this was of some help."
footballmanagergames,3cuvwh,fenntastic,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:20:10 2015 UTC,"Create your tactic using common sense and principles you've learned from playing FM. Start playing games with it and analyzing the stats after each game, trying different players each game. You'll start to notice if you're losing possession in certain areas or if one role/player is taking too much or not enough shots.  Things like key chances created and shots on target are an indication that the tactic is working well, for me personally. If I'm not getting those then I'll tweak a position or two, a few adjustments overall and see how that goes."
footballmanagergames,3cuvwh,Intergalactic_Vandal,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:40:08 2015 UTC,You should create a mirror image of the formation in the x axis. So swap a  4-4-2 to a 2-4-4 etc.   This is the best way to tweak a tactic.  Yes.  Definitely.
footballmanagergames,3cuvwh,SirArchieCartwheeler,0,Sun Jul 12 22:43:26 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think the best method is to buy the editor and choose a mid-table or worse team in one of the top 4 leagues to start a save with. Create your tactic and then bring in any players you think you need for the tactic. From there advance through the season like you normally would. Play at least 10 matches and use the editor to remove any big injuries that happen (you're testing the tactic and losing a key player really skews your testing).  By picking a team that's mid-table or below, it will be pretty obvious when you're overachieving and your tactic is doing well. By using this one save as the base save for all of your testing you'll have an easy time comparing how good one tactic is compared to another as well."

Should get him in perfect position to have opportunities to use those 20 Long Shots or find the right pass. Just get the ball to him - nice looking player.
footballmanagergames,3ctke8,MarkyAurelius,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:03:13 2015 UTC,"So i gave him a shot as an Enganche, it wasn't great... he got a 6.4 even though we won 4-1, it seems kind of pointless in the match engine if he doesn't move. His attributes match that of a DLP so i might just naturalise him to CM and give him some passing PPMs, like a QB for my attackers."
footballmanagergames,3ctke8,frithjofr,3,Fri Jul 10 20:06:40 2015 UTC,"I'd give him another shot as an Enganche. Try working in a 4-3-1-2 formation with a BWM, CM(auto) and a BTB or AP(A), of course your man as an Enganche in the attacking midfield, with a TM(S) and a DLF(A) up front.  That should allow him to post up ahead of your midfield to receive balls and either craft a nice through pass to the target man or move the ball long enough for the DLF to stretch out the defense and allow your men to get forward.  Alternatively! I'd suggest playing him in my favorite formation, an asymmetric 4-1-2-3. What I'd do here is change my striker to a TM(A), and my AMC, your man, to an Enganche. I might also consider switching my AP in mid to either a roaming playmaker or a box to box, or even just a simple CM(Auto) since you'll want your enganche to be crafting out most of the plays. With the asymmetrics you can, of course, reverse the balance, and use a ML and an AMR if you so choose.  But all of this is just theory crafting and results are, of course, dependent on more than one man. It's best to try and fit the player into the team than bend the team to fit the player. But he certainly does look like quite a talent.  And remember! Switching to a new tactic, even making minor changes to an existing tactic like going from a SS to an Enganche will lower the team's tactical familiarity. Give it a couple games before making a decision either way."

footballmanagergames,3ctke8,TheNem3sys,3,Fri Jul 10 19:00:18 2015 UTC,"He reminds me a bit of Totti with those stats, i played him as a false 9 in a 4-3-3 and he scored almost 50 goals in two seasons (mostly from long shots) and provided 30 or so assists.  the idea is to have him sit in the middle of the opponent's side of the field and have him distribute the ball to wide player and then sit outside the box ready to shoot from the distance if he gets the ball back, so i'd play him anywhere between advanced playmaker and false 9, maybe the engance role is the best like the other comment said, about instructions i think you should have him keep the ball and make him take risky passes and also to shoot more often, but a player like this is only as good as the players around him so you should try to play with a formation like 4-3-3 (playing as false 9) or a classic or wide diamond 4-4-2 (false 9 in classic and AM in diamond formation, in both cases the wingers should be fast and offensive) or a 4-2-3-1 playing as AM but that's just your personal preference, just remember to have fast wingers and strikers that will do the movement instead of him and recive his assists"
footballmanagergames,3ctke8,Montuvito_G,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:48:27 2015 UTC,Deep-lying playmaker? Wouldn't need to surge up the pitch as long as he has 1-2 strong midfield partners and speedy wingers.

footballmanagergames,3ctke8,IIFollowYou,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:12:25 2015 UTC,"I would play him as a roaming playmaker or centre mid in CM, or as an attacking midfield. He definitely has the tackling/positioning/marking to work in a 3 man midfield as an attacking 'medium' player ie. not defensive or attacking. His mental stats let him down a little as a CM, but his strength and height will be more useful there than further up as an AM. I like to play possession football though, so it make not work as well on your tactics. Maybe if you have one DM, one slightly more defensive midfielder and then this guy as a RP, you can launch counters well in a 4-3-3."

This has the added benefit of making use of his exceptional jumping skill. I wouldn't worry about ratings too much for those positions and instead look at pass completion %, interceptions per game, and watch how often he spreads the play in game."

footballmanagergames,3csaki,john87000,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:15:51 2015 UTC,"This was an issue on previous FMs moreso than FM15, when a player got a serious injury his attributes would plummet so hard it was ridiculous, still happens in FM15 but not nearly as bad.  It's also a factor of age though, a 29 year old breaking his leg will probably never be the same player again because his CA will just never rise back to where it was. For a young player it's not that big a deal anymore."
footballmanagergames,3csaki,Bar333,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:45:18 2015 UTC,"It depends when it happens. If the player is too young, it can be lethal.

Likewise, if he's in the early 30's, it can also kill his career. But between those extremes, a key player with good physical attributes should be able to get back on foot."

footballmanagergames,3cs6ok,Keiano,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:15:07 2015 UTC,"Imo, I think looking at the stats themselves are better than looking at the stars rating. The stars rating are more of a generalised overview of the players themselves in relation to your team. Just my 2 cents though."

footballmanagergames,3cq6qe,jackgoat,2,Fri Jul 10 00:11:06 2015 UTC,Playing them in the new position helps them learn it faster also
footballmanagergames,3cq6qe,BagelWarlock,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:46:42 2015 UTC,On top of what's been said already. Keep in mind it's much better to buy players who are naturals in that position because training for another position will eat into their potential which you should ideally want to spend on stats.  With lower leagues or players who aren't going to be world class it doesn't matter as much.
footballmanagergames,3cq6qe,ClandestineMovah,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:54:18 2015 UTC,Select the position in training and make sure they get match time in that position. They won't become 'natural' in the new position unless the play there regularity.   I constantly retrain player positions when you find strikers who would be better CMs or wingers who I'd rather have at wing back.
footballmanagergames,3cq6qe,SirArchieCartwheeler,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:18:38 2015 UTC,Can you retrain a player to play in a position they couldn't play at all originally?
footballmanagergames,3cq6qe,januzaj_44,2,Fri Jul 10 12:13:01 2015 UTC,"In my Chelsea save, I trained a CB to play ST and a CDM to play RB.  So, yeah. You can train a player in a position they were completely oblivious to before."

footballmanagergames,3colcv,KronIC_,2,Thu Jul 9 16:16:58 2015 UTC,It's also semi unnecessary in game since scout reports usually give you a pretty good idea of whether a player is interested in joining and how much they will likely be looking for if they do join.

footballmanagergames,3cmaud,rebeleagle,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:16:49 2015 UTC,"I have them the other way around with Messi upfront as a DLF (A) and Suarez on the right as a Raumdeuter.   In my first season Messi got 50+ goals in the league and 24 assists. This season he's en route to getting as many goals but his assists have gone down significantly (Not that it matters, others have picked up the missing assists).  Suarez got like 15 goals and assists in his first season, however this season he has gotten as many goals and assists in 10 less games (However, Neymars contribution has gone down a lot in both goals and assists, so maybe that has to do with Suarez's improvement).  I play a 4-3-3 (duh) with a                           SK (A)   CWB (S,Alves), BPD, CD, FB (A, Alba)                       DM (D)       RPM (Pogba), DLP (S,Raktic)   Raumdeuter                           IF (Neymar, S)                      DLF (A, Messi)"

footballmanagergames,3co07y,Lied,7,Fri Jul 10 11:29:12 2015 UTC,"I can see where you're coming from but challenges like the San Marino Challenge are generally harder to complete than editing in a load of money into a team. After 5 seasons with Leicester you should be challenging for Europe in this game, even without the 180 million thrown in?   I just started the Dafuge challenge and it's a hell of a lot of fun working your way up through divisions, trying to build a competitive team with 0 transfer budget and 6k wages.  It's long, but it's also a lot more difficult and those two generally do have some overlap."
footballmanagergames,3co07y,Quinn155,0,Thu Jul 9 12:49:35 2015 UTC,"Sorry it was supposed to be 3 years and 180 million doesn't mean transfer budget of 180m, it means you'll probably get 80 million to spend over 3 years, and to be honest with the summer transfers that should be reduced a bit anyway as they obviously spent some of that last summer."

I can't offer much advice at the moment because FM is a complex animal and there are any number of things you could be getting wrong and they alone could be enough to ensure you don't finish top.  If you're not completely confident then I'd go manage a club in another league. Spend some time dominating that league which should in turn give you the opportunity to refine your knowledge of tactics and help develop your understand of the improvement of your team through training.

The problem for you is, if you're new you don't know what it is you're doing wrong and so you don't know how to fix it.  Keep reading forums and you'll see people referring to things you don't understand. Google those phrases.  In the mean time swallow your pride and play a team which will dominate the league.

footballmanagergames,3co9s5,Ikestar,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:23:51 2015 UTC,"Also keep in mind that money isn't the only thing holding a small club back, reputation is almost as important.  In my present save I've had players ask for stupid wages simply because the player (or more accurately) the players agent knows that he can get a better deal for the player (and him) elsewhere.   It works both ways. When you're Real Madrid/Man U etc then you can simply poach free transfers.  When you sign players you need to think what would be considered average for a player with that role be it key player, rotation or whatever. Get an idea, learn what the club can afford to pay for those roles and stay within it.  If you can't match it then make sure you sell the player one year before his contract expires as the players value will still be relatively high and he cannot be approached by other clubs."

I went to check how much he wants w/o the agent- pretty much the same minus the agent fee (which was 100k) so yeah...just until recently the board was allowing me to keep 80% of transfer revenue but then they decided to go on a wreckless spending spree and decreased it to 40% so I won't get a lot of $$ if I sell him / all of them  I use annual salaries because it's easier for me to see at a glance how much a player is going to cost me over a season, since I sign players on a per season basis, I thought it was more convenient than multiplying by 52 every time."

footballmanagergames,3cnu8i,klyemann,2,Thu Jul 9 14:07:24 2015 UTC,"It's a ""Season Preview"" it's generated way before the league even starts and transfers (past that) have nothing to do with it.  I could have taken the screenshot on a later date, and it would be the same.  The reason my team's odds were so high is that since it's a Dafuge Challenge where you take over a team newly promoted from the regional divisions the team is weak right from the outset. All the players I began with were no where near good enough so we got really high odds, but after that i got rid of them all and rebuilt the team properly."

The two major things that I hadn't done were go a league season unbeaten (still haven't done it) and produce my own world class striker fresh from my own academy that goes on and beats the record for most league goals.   And then up steps Charles Newman. Liverpool born and bred.  He was 6'1; near enough the perfect height of a striker. He was strong, good in the air, quick and had was deadly in front of goal. Long story short, he went on to break Roger Hunt's record of 245 goals when he was around 30. Scenes, complete and utter scenes.  I played, and still do play, a 4-2-3-1 so a great striker is vital. I'd had them in the past in abundance; Vaclav Kadlec, Jan Koch and Acosta in that order, each leaving the other with huge shoes to fill, shoes that got bigger with every passing retirement. They were all brilliant but Charlie boy was a different class.  Then my game corrupted."

I managed to get a promotion the next season and started working this striker into my lineup and he started scoring all the time and turned into my best attacker for the next 10+ years winning tons of silverware and ultimately the world cup.  He went from 5 star potential to 4 star CA and later 3 star as I became the biggest club in the world but he never stopped scoring.    I always felt he was a regen for Watford but I really owed him to the previous manager who bought him for like 150k."

footballmanagergames,3cp5my,ClandestineMovah,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:59:19 2015 UTC,I do this too. If the workload of staff is low and the quality of staff is high then I put all younger players to heavy.  Once a player gets close to his potential I put it to average so as not to overwork him.
footballmanagergames,3co9ox,chrisarg72,3,Thu Jul 9 13:24:07 2015 UTC,It's down to age and ability. To some extent potential factors too.  Look at the players scout report on ability and look at the stats. If the scout thinks he's ok for your league and the stats confirm it then you not only want to play him you're doing him a disservice if you don't play him competitively in that league.  If he's too young or he's not quite good enough then I personally try and get him out on loan at a club that has good facilities which is an insurance in case the loaning team don't play him.  TL:DR - It's a judgement call. Listen to your staffs report on the player and look at his stats

footballmanagergames,3cpflf,appelbreg,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:49:15 2015 UTC,"Not every real life takeover is by a rich owner who will invest in the club to get it to a higher level. Sometimes it's an idiot who doesn't know what they're doing takes over. Look what happened to Portsmouth. Four takeovers in 1 season got them and they went into administration. They then got what seemed like a sensible takeover when they were in the Championship. However, that owner was later arrested in Lithuania which lead to Portsmouth's bank accounts being frozen. It wasn't until they were down in League 2 that their fans could step in and buy their club to stop madness like that happening again."

Heck, in my Sheffield Wednesday save 4 clubs from the Championship got Tycoon'd (Norwich, Birmingham City, Ipswich and Reading), all of those clubs were in the EPL within 2 seasons and went on to have some degree of success.   Seen it in other saves too, Norwich usually gets taken over and does really well. Just a matter of chance really.   One thing I'll say is that teams tend to be terrible at finding quality coaches."

Dynamic rivalries (i.e. competitive rivalries develop in-game and bring more gate receipts etc.).  Imagine teams that you constantly battle with for the title, or teams that always play dirty against you, developing to be a rival on your club's information screen.  Having investment roles at a club if you stay with them long enough, giving you permission to purchase affiliate clubs (similar to what Man City are doing in owning New York City FC and Melbourne City).  That way, you could develop football in any country of your choice.

It'd be nice if the whole press conference thing was rewritten and made less 'samey' week in week out. But i think that might be a lot to ask for they'll probably just add another few questions and reword a couple of the others and it'll still be the same every week. It'd be nice if when you answer a question passionately the options to answer are more 'passionate' and like wise for the other options. For example 'how did you feel about the challenge on player X?' Answer Passionate: 'it was a utter disgrace player Y and his manager need to take a long hard look at themselves' Answer Clam: 'It wasn't a good tackle but i doubt he wanted to hurt the player' etc Possibly a bad example but a bit more of a mixture would add verity.

footballmanagergames,3ck0ow,KennethKanniff,11,Wed Jul 8 17:11:49 2015 UTC,"1) MLS needs a fix where certain star players are willing to play in the league as a DP. On my saves, after a few seasons there are basically no DPs at all.   2) If one team becomes dominant in a league, the AI should become more difficult (i.e., make better signings) to catch up. So if Juve wins the league for 4-5 straight seasons, then the AI should make the other clubs sign better players to catch up.  3) There should never be a situation where there is nobody who wants to take on my wonderkid on loan, even if I put 0 cost. This has been vastly improved in FM15, but it should never happen ever. You should always be able to find a team willing to take on a free loanee.   4) Obviously fix the situation where players complain they want to win trophies when your club has just won the league or European trophy.  5) When trying to unsettle a player - give an option where you state how big a contract you are willing to offer. But to keep this from being abused, make it so if you don't offer at least that amount, the player will reject you."

footballmanagergames,3ck0ow,okaysian,19,Wed Jul 8 14:54:51 2015 UTC,"I agree about the monopoly position. Sports Interactive doesn't make enough improvements. Maybe because they know FM is addictive and people will buy the game anyway. I don't. I buy it every other year. Not this year OR they should make major changes.  But I do not agree, at all, about the match engine! That's the last thing I would change. I don't play for the graphics. If I want to see pretty graphics I'll play Fifa. I also think the engine has improved fairly over the years and I think it looks alright.  I could write about 20 pages of things I would really want to be changed. But the most important things are:  -FM is way too arcade for my liking! Sports Interactive claims there is dept in the game but I don't agree because there are a lot of basic things I just can't do as a manager.   I want to be able to create and train detailed set pieces. This free kick for example: I want to make a ""drawing"" of 3 players jumping over the ball before the forth one passes the ball past the wall to another player who puts a low cross into the box, so that the first player who jumped over the ball can tap it in.  I want to create tactics in detail: tell players where to run to in a situation, who to play to etc. I'm repeating myself but tactics are way to arcade as well, for my liking.  I want to be able to really DO training. Now I don't do anything. I want want to be able to tell them exactly what to do and maybe even see them sprinting. Make them do passing exercises etc. I want to see who does well etc. etc.   -Interaction really has to be changed as well. I can't stand getting the same questions from press and reading their dumb conclusions (""That's not what I said?!""). And I don't want players to complain about wanting to transfer to a team that plays in the Champions League while I've been in the final for three seasons in a row...   -I want to create the stadium and other facilities or at least have more say in it. Development has no real boundaries in real life, in FM the steps you can take towards a world class facility are way to fast. I would love more facilities and activities; a language school for example. Where you can hire teachers and tell players to get more into studying if the still can't speak the language properly. Stuff like that.  -I want to be able to do something with my own money. I've been writing way to much already so I won't give suggestions but a lot is possible.  PS. I forgot an important (and somehting really easy to create!) feature: We should be able to start a career as a real life manager. That would be awesome!  PS. 2. I would like to have the option to see how much a player has developed over a certain period of time. And I would love to be able to select certain aspects for all player contract before I start negotiating. That would save a lot of time. For example: always set ""5% wage increase per year"" or what ever."

footballmanagergames,3ck0ow,LiquidEnvy,3,Wed Jul 8 17:08:57 2015 UTC,"Hmm here are the big things I think need to be fixed:  Aging curve: Right now, older players are underpowered relative to how they are in real life. This is probably because physical stats are either overvalued in the game engine or the aging induced drop in physicals is too drastic. For example, from age 27 to 33, Benatia dropped from 17 strength to 12 strength when it feels like only pace related items should drop to that extent. This also leads to weird transfers once world class players hit 34 and above where the top teams don't want to touch them despite still having great technical and mental stats and they end up moving to a team they'd probably never consider in real life. Also, it would be nice if older players had more speculation in the media around their careers and some retirements are built up more. For example, you don't hear anything about Xavi/Iniesta retiring unless they're shortlisted but a retirement like that should at least carry its own news item.  In relation to this: Older Player Transfers- While every player's career winds down differently, I feel like it's too random right now. I'd classify the last clubs of most top players as being one of the following:   Club that produced them   Club they spent the most time at  Top European Club (aging stars, for example, have done pretty well in the Serie A historically. Milan have a history of signing older stars in the cheap. Inter did so for Figo, Juve for Pirlo, etc)   Club from home country  Club at top division of country they spent a lot of time in   High paying lower level league (Turkey is the most competitive among these but high profile ones are MLS and Middle East)  Transfers like Raul to Schalke are less common in reality than they are in game. My current save has transfers like Pepe to West Brom, Pirlo to Feyenoord and then Tenerife, Mascherano to Empoli, and Zlatan to Sampdoria (although more understandable since he played majority of his career in Serie A)  Transfer AI: Every rich team approaches transfers like they're Real Madrid. Endless buying of strikers and attacking midfielders when the primary weak point is somewhere else. For example, in my game, Liverpool are doing well and are usually top 3 in England. Despite Mignolet not being a top level keeper in game, they haven't made an effort to recruit a better keeper. Instead, they're loaded in attack with Sturridge, Balotelli, Markovic, Coutinho, and Sterling reinforced over the years by Tielemans, Hojberg, Damm, Berardi, Zozulya, and Wellington Nem. The problem is particularly egregious among GKs, where teams like Bayern and PSG don't try to sign top level keepers once Neuer and Sirigu retire or decline.  Contracts- It would be ideal if players have weights towards a variety of factors when deciding who to sign for and how much to demand. A player who is all about the money will go to the highest bidder while a more ambitious player could take less money to sign for a promising team (which usually consists of player controlled managers, of course, since issues like this are the root of our complaints). This could actually allow the ""Talk to Player"" option when signing guys to have a more prominent role in distinguishing your manager as a Klopp/Guardiola type of attraction or an uncharismatic guy players don't want to sign for  Manager movement- This, in general, is terrible. Not only are manager hirings seemingly random but timing is never taken into account. In the aforementioned save where Liverpool did well, they made it to the CL Final while Barcelona decided to fire Luis Enrique because they were 3rd in the league. Instead of a pre-contract agreement with Brendan Rodgers or hiring an interim manager to oversee the last weeks of the season (I don't think they had league games left at that point), Barcelona sign Rodgers and Liverpool play in the final managed by their assistant.  Overall, more storytelling would be nice. Right now, you don't really feel the competition in the transfer market and there's minimal chatter in the run up to the final game of the season when the title is still on the line. You don't get much of a sense about teams around Europe that have ambitions to improve, overperformers building a platform to success (Dortmund and Sevilla types), and the old guard going into decline. It would be interesting if there could be a season summary article for every team in the divisions you run that can describe how they performed relative to expectations, the positives, and negatives of the season, and just in general more context into the situation. Switching clubs isn't really that appealing because you know your team's story and its context but you have no idea what's going on if you move to a new team"

It's infuriating to have 51 shots with 30 on target only to have five goals and then the AI have seven shots, five on target, but five goals. This happens too consistently.

This would allow me to play months in the same league.  This is the only change I would be looking for in the upcoming FM16/17 if this doesn't happen then I will be pretty sad.  Another annoying thing that I hate is the fact that I need to wait 20 season to get a new stadium.  I play Maidenhead, my team built a new stadium in division 6 and it holds just 15k people, now I am into my 33rd season and I still have 15k people stadium because council refuses to build the stadium or if this message doesn't pop up and I go to board and try to talk with the owner he says he doesn't see any reason to build a new stadium despite fantastic finance situation.

At 4-1 I'm relatively calm because they've been quiet and useless all game and there's no sign of the goal being indicative of an upcoming turnaround. So I just assertively warn them to ""Concentrate"" in the in-game team talk.  It's 4-2. Still, it's 80th minute already, what can possibly go wrong? I switch to a more conservative tactic on Defend/Waste Time with Limited FBs, make a defensive sub and anxiously wait for the final whistle.  90+somethingth minute, and they pull the third goal back. I am incredibly frustrated but still absolutely adamant we're getting the win. There's just no time left for another attack. I am preparing my best ""Jekyll and Hyde"" routine for the post-match talk. I switch to Contain.  Next thing you know, my so-called footballers lose possession in the middle of the pitch after restarting the game, and my right-back is so much out of position that the counter-attack seemingly caught him halfway to the showers already."

footballmanagergames,3cjp46,adeptruddle,2,Wed Jul 8 13:49:23 2015 UTC,"But how? I'm frequently transfer listing and offering out my players. But players worth 1m only attract 100k bids.   It's proportional. The loan fee is going to be comparable to the value of the player.  Keep in mind the reputation of the club I'm playing. I'm a long way into the save (check the date)  The club is financially and reputably one of the biggest in the world and I think that's why I'm finding it easy to drive up prices/loan fees.   Do you just not sell if they don't accept your distorted prices?    Distorted loan fees you mean?  My thinking is this. If I'm going to sell a player then ideally I should sell him when he's in his prime. This would be a rough guide.  GK - 30-32  Fullback - 25-30  CB - 27 - 30  Winger - 26 - 30  CM - 26 - 30  Striker - 26 - 30  Now if the player is rubbish I might just sell him straight away. That's unlikely though as my scouts are pretty solid now and I generally only sign very good players. If the player is decent then I might as well get loan fee's until he's older and have the other club pay his wages. Even if I can't get a loan fee I might as well let another club develop him for me and then I can cash in later.  Also, keep in mind you'll get a lot more interest towards the end of a transfer window as opposed to the beginning of one."

I started in Asia on a new FM12 save recently, ended up in North Korea. Won the league in my first two seasons, didn't qualify for any continental competition. Then in my third season I was suddenly entered into the AFC President's Cup. After a bit of googling it turns out that this is Asia's third most prestigious club competition, after the ACL and the the AFC Cup. It turns out that Asia divides it's nations into 'developed' and 'developing' nations, and if the nation you are managing in falls into the latter category, you are unable to even qualify for the ACL proper. The President's Cup is now defunct in real life, but I'm not sure if this happened prior of after FM13. And I'm still not sure what exactly constitutes qualifying for the AFC Cup; some years my North Korean team would, others they wouldn't.  tl;dr - I don't think you can play in the ACL proper as an Indian club. Try China or Indonesia instead, or download some custom databases as Thai and Vietnamese clubs can qualify for the ACL."

Turned out to be better than any of my other strikers. Due to his insane mental attributes,  personality and natural fitness he didn't really decline at all over the rest of the season.   He ended up scoring 16 goals in 6 months. Obviously I extended his conrtact and the next season he was top goalscorer with 32 goals and fired us  into europe. I managed to get the ivory Coast job and convinced him to come out of retirement as I was favoured personnel.   He remained as first choice striker for crystal palace and ivory Coast for the next 3 years winning the bpl twice,  Europa league and champions league once and helping ivory Coast to the semi finals of the 2018 world cup.

I'm enjoying the challenge overall but for some reason the team was loaded with strikers and central defenders.  A couple months into my first season with them and we've devolved into a drama factory where two or three players are constantly bitching about not having enough playing time.  No matter how hard I rotate it just doesn't do shit and these 33 year old players are whining about their football careers being flushed when they'd be better off retiring immediately and getting a job at the local fish shop.

I took over at Man Utd in the middle of a season, just had to pick my battles to the end of the year, and then started offering the whiners out on loan or transfer. Most of them were 2-star potential (which at Man U means they're worth $20 million and making $120K/wk) so I sent about 5 of them away to various European locales.  You do have to remember, at the Scottish 1st division level, 33 year old players think they still have another 8-10 years left in them. They won't necessarily step aside for a hot-prospect kid who's going to take their playing time."

One of my players won the Player of the Year award (a playmaker) yet he wasn't even included in the overall best 11 for the league??

footballmanagergames,3ck5d3,Campingduck,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:58:09 2015 UTC,I'm trying to make an away tactic for my Portsmouth side but I can't create a good tactic if my life depended on it.  I somehow managed to make a good home tactic which works amazing when I'm the better team but leaks so many goals when I'm away or home against a better team  Here is my main  tactic and instructions.  Here are some tactics I've tried creating but have not worked at all:  tactic 2 - instructions 2  tactic 3 - instructions 3  So if someone explain to me what I did right in my main tactic and what I'm doing wrong in the other ones that would be great :)
footballmanagergames,3ck5d3,DorothyJMan,2,Wed Jul 8 20:35:56 2015 UTC,"Tactic 2 could work with some tweaking.   First of all, reduce the tempo down to just 'high' to prevent losing the ball.  Secondly, it's quite disconnected. In the attacking phase you only have your 3 forwards, and support from a b2b. Which is fine, but you're trying to work the ball into the box, which is much more difficult when 7 of your team are staying right back. Take off 'work ball into box'. Perhaps move the DLP(d) to the right hand side and put the RB to (s), to provide some width when the IF cuts inside.  Thirdly, 'be more disciplined' is always a good idea when you're defending.  Hope this helps :)"

Get them to run the flanks and  put as many balls into the box as possible. Since all your players will be far and away better than anyone else in the division (except maybe hearts) you should really breeze the first season after that you lose all the newcastle players and you'll have to do some good recruiting to do well in the second season. In terms of transfers for the first season, you'll definitely need a new RB as Richard Foster is crap. Zimmerman from BMG is a good bet. Other than that the team is strong and the youth academy is brilliant so definitely abuse the shit out of it for young talent. So enjoy managing the most successful club in the world."

Overall, it's not a hard league to succeed, with any team you can easily improve year after year, but reaching the levels of Porto and Benfica (Sporting is always shaky on my saves) takes a lot of dedication. I'm in 2019 and I won the league once already.  There are a lot of quality players in the Big 3 reserves, get them on loan or, eventually, buy them out whenever you get the chance. Some of these players are:  Zezinho(Sporting), Rafa (Porto), Pedro Moreira (Porto), Tozé (Porto), André Silva (Porto), João Nunes (Benfica), Matheus Carvalho (Sporting), Victor Andrade (Benfica), Cafú (Guimarães), Luis Rocha (Guimarães), Victor Garcia (Porto), Esgaio (Sporting), Mikel Agu (Porto), Sérgio Oliveira (Paços), etc."

If you want to aim high, look to be beating the likes of Braga/Maritimo.  The best way is to use the transfer market intelligently - spend hours if need be to find a rough diamond. Portugal has lax transfer restrictions so the market will be very open for you. Look to Africa and South Europe for gems; on my FM14 Boavista save I found an excellent 16-year old Greek prospect at Doxa Dramas, bought him for cheap, then sold him two years later for mega money (while also getting stellar performances out of him). Doing that two or three times will give you a solid financial platform to build longer-term.  In short - don't expect to even challenge the big three straight away, and play the long game instead."

I decided to get more serious for the home leg and I played my full team. I was humbled 3-1. Thoroughly humiliating, considering I had qualified for the CL for about 3 seasons running before that, and I was a much higher seed than Zilina.   The moral of the story is: do not underestimate your competition at such a crucial stage.   Another humiliation was when I managed chelsea to the CL final in FM 2012 (I think). I was on fire, I had won the league and Cup double, Cavani had scored 45+ goals, Van Der Wiel scored a last-minute extra time winner against PSG to send me through to the final. I had a solid defence and potent attack. It just seemed like it was my year.   Well, it wasn't. I got skelped 5-0 in the final by Barcelona, with Alexis Sanchez netting all 5.

Some of the most fun I've ever had on FM, at first you are signing all your players on non contracts, two pound a week. As you build your way up through the ranks it becomes increasingly difficult to unseat Linfield as the best team in the league, as there is only one champions league spot, and they have quadruple the funds of any other team in the league. Interestingly enough, because the finances of the league are so poor, teams are more vulnerable to takeover bids and I even had a few other teams get taken over by billionaires who invested loads of money into their clubs, adding an extra challenge. It is an incredibly rewarding save, especially once you have achieved major success with the team and they name their new stadium after you :D I would highly recommend it, although it will test your patience, as you are literally building a team from the ground up and transforming them into a European powerhouse.

footballmanagergames,3cjodz,iamoftenwrong,2,Wed Jul 8 19:30:42 2015 UTC,Also did a Chimney Corner save (dat name) at the time I think I was also running a French editor file down to CFA2 so I just signed all these players from the colonies like Réunion & dominated the leagues with them
footballmanagergames,3cjodz,KennethKanniff,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:50:28 2015 UTC,"I've gone with Crusaders FM13. Won my first four and then got beat 2-1 to Linfield away. Encouraging stuff.  Made some good loans from the lower leagues of England and a couple of other good free signings. Not half as challenging as the Chimney Corner's of the world of course, but it's still going to be a challenge nevertheless.  I think relative success at the top end of the table should be easy enough even though I was tipped for relegation, but like you said FeedMeToTheSquirrels, displacing Linfield is going to be a hell of a task (one they managed this year in real life!)"

footballmanagergames,3cj9a9,djipaloz,5,Wed Jul 8 10:02:36 2015 UTC,"Well; the fitness of players is always pretty low after the summer holiday so I guess you need to work on that in pre-season; just like in real life.  It doesn't improve match fitness (maybe a few %); you have to play friendlies in the pre-season to get the match fitness up. Also just like in real life.  I always do what most clubs do in real life: I start with one week of medium fitness training, a few weeks of intense training, a few matches against very bad teams, a few against average teams (now also work on teamplay, tactics, etc.) and a few against good teams.   At the beginning of the season all my players are +/- 100% fit and +/- 95% match fit. A few reserve players are a bit behind on match fitness but they can get fully fit in the season start at the reserves. Sometimes it's useful to let some of the first team players play with the reserves in the pre-season, just to get extra match fitness.  PS. It probably also makes fitness related stats a like bit higher."

footballmanagergames,3cgvt9,Anledningen,2,Tue Jul 7 21:46:57 2015 UTC,"Holding onto it means it will be taxed, so you'll technically be losing money (although it probably won't be that much).   You could invest it in young regens with high potential that you could get a good return on them in the future. Or if they're good enough they could fit into your team at a later date.   I would invest in assets such as training/youth facilities or stadium expansions etc. Although seeing as you are Barcelona I would suspect that all facilities are maxed out.   What I tend to do later in the game when I have surplus cash is buy a shit player for millions of pounds from a small club from the same city in order to get them to rise through the leagues and provide more of a local rivalry, as well as improving the standard of local youth players"

We all know how to configure a tactic in FM, but the little men on the screen are programmed to behave in certain roles. Real life players don't, so my guess is you need to go much more into tactical detail and drill that in by doing training. And I wouldn't know how to do that - though, I must admit..

footballmanagergames,3cf8o9,Supalio,2,Tue Jul 7 16:00:00 2015 UTC,"Putting aside the lack of respect he would inspire and only considering the technical and tactical aspects, I think it would be really hard.  First off, the day to day training planning would be quite hard to do. What kind of exercises do you do to train your players ? To prepare for a very specific opposition ? That's something FM doesn't teach you.  Scouting is also completely different. No detailed stats for each player, it's much more difficult to compare two players or to find the hidden gem. And you would have to deal with players you did not even want in the first place.  Concerning the tactical aspect, I'm a bit unsure. I find it is not that important in FM (I mean that if you have better players, you will most of the time dominate the game). I'm not sure that a good FM manager could handle the  slight variations of tactics that is required to win a game when you're the underdog or when you're losing, but maybe the best virtual manager could..."
footballmanagergames,3cf8o9,Montuvito_G,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:57:13 2015 UTC,"While FM's player-staff relationship system is improving, it's nowhere near as authentic as the real thing. Pep talks, one-on-one interaction, and boardroom requests are just the tip of the iceberg. In real life, managers have to deal with players as actual human beings with real-life adversities, difficulties, and disorders. My point is that even the best FM maestro would probably find himself overwhelmed at the spontaneous nature of the responsibilities a manager would have to his club.   TL;DR There's a lot more to being a real life football manager than FM lets on."
footballmanagergames,3cf8o9,as-well,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:14:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think it would be good. Managing a real football team is all about communications, managing training, studying video, and communication your chosen tactics to the players (as far as I understand). Those are not skills you get from playing soccer manager, where you basically just have to look at stats and then form a tactic around them.   One example: Lucien Favre is often credited with showing one of his players (can't remember which one) to stand on his toes so that he is a couple of milliseconds faster at the ball than the other players. Could any of us virtual managers do that?"

Formation: with a flat back 4, 2 CDMs, 1 CM, LM-RM and ST are the only attacking options and even these are ordered to track back and work hard.  Instructions: the entire formation is built to replicate the infamous chelsea vs liverpool game where Gerrard slipped, the players instructions mean that the ball is never played into dangerous areas and there is always men stacked up behind the ball so you can't get counter attacked."

I especially like the way you've combined the two IF-S with a Treq and CF-A, the Inside Forwards feeding the two attackers (presumably).  I wonder if part of your defensive issues (aside from space opening up when the DM & CM go walkabout) is having them ""limited"".  By which I mean they'll be inclined to lump the ball away when they get it, meaning it more often than otherwise comes right back at the defense, creating chances that wouldn't happen with more rounded defenders.  Basically, I wonder if your defense would improve if you simply changed the LFBs to FBs a LDs to CDs."

He signed for one of my friends, who proceeded to rub it in our faces... until the kid announced this was a mere stepping stone for his career. Oh and the manager should build the team around him.

footballmanagergames,3ce5jr,autowikibot,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:21:12 2015 UTC,"My best buy is probably Richairo Zivkovic on my Anderlecht save. I have a long running Anderlecht save, where I consistently won the league 4 times in a row (not to difficult) and slowly built a team that could compete for the CL. In my fourth season I had a team that looked like this:  ----------------------Rulli------------------------  -Arias----Balanta---Vallejo----R.Guerreiro-  ----------------------Faes-----------------------  ------------Praet----------Apdemoglü--------  -Graciani-----------------------------J.Green-  ----------------Mitrovic/Barbosa-------------  Obviously Mitrovic and Barbosa are both very high quality players, especially for this team (only Balanta and Vallejo are comperable, maybe apdemoglü but he's very young still). In my 4th season the team went on a murder spree in CL and I destroyed Man City, Marseille, Real and Juventus to claim the title. Mitrovic especially scored like 8-9 goals in CL.  After winning the CL, the big money teams came knocking and I couldn't keep Mitrovic (United) and Barbosa (Bayern). So I picked up Richairo Zivkovic from PSG who had developed decently stats wise, but had a terrible carreer so far. (played some games for Ajax but never scored more than 6 goals per season, went to PSG to never play)  He didn't need any time adjusting. Im halfway through my 5th season and he scored 27 goals in 19 apps, (7 of them in the CL group stage) and is by far outscoring both Mitrovic and Barbosa.  Honorable Mention would be Julian Green who I loaned out for 3 seasons in a row and who has consistently scored ~15 goals per season from the wing and is now playing regular first team football for bayern."
footballmanagergames,3ce5jr,Zhivago92,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:20:46 2015 UTC,"Got Hallilovic and Traore on loan from Barcelona at least 4/5 seasons into the game (started in League 1, got up to the Premiership). They helped me finish mid table and got Europa League. Hallilovic was our best player with double digit goals and assists while Traore had something like 8 goals, 14 assists and both guys had mid 7s ratings.  Definitely knew they weren't signing for me but I decided to scout and inquire about them because I could afford one of them and it confirmed that a. Barcelona was unlikely to sell and b. they weren't interested in signing for me so I thought that was that.  The two guys proceed to not get any playing time for Barcelona and weren't loan listed either. Around December, I'm sitting in 9th and get offered Traore at 4.5 million Euros (I had offered 7.5 million that summer) and I pounce. He agrees a reasonable (for his skill and proven production in my system) contract as the highest paid player on my team and tears the Prem apart and helps me get to 6th place. He starts off the next season like a house on fire again and City come calling and I get them to offer 45 million euros that set up the platform for a Champions League qualification 3 years down the road and a title another 4 years after.  Overall, I ended up paying 1 season's worth of wages (must have been 40-50k/week) and 4.5 million euros for 2 full seasons of Adama Traore.

As for the worst, well...most of the ones I've made in my main FM15 save. Shout out to Paul Connely though, who I signed in my first year at SKC in the MLS. Never settled, wanted to go home, but would never agree to a contract termination and was generally garbage. Eventually shipped him out on a free. Also Sidney Sam at Stoke for more or less the same reasons, although he was signed on a free as cover/tutoring so I guess it didn't really back fire."

I could get 80m by selling him to Chelsea but I dont want to sell a good player to a same league competitor so I accept 70m offer from PSG instead. He was horrible when I first got him, even the other staffs thought I should drop him but I still kept him around and taught him the way of awesome. Four years later, he became the best M(C) in English premier league.   Then I bough a guy just (nearly) as good but 3 years younger for 25m from Legia. I found this guy after the US tour, Chicago something. I made an offer for him but he accepted another offer from Legia. I took note of all of his achieves (his rating is really good and he totally the cream something for US team). Two years later, I saw him on the transfer list so I made an offer for him. He got offer from 7 clubs but he accepted mine.   My worst case is a 24 years old D(C). His salary is 20k per week I have no use for him and nobody want to loan him on full salary so I sold him for 1m (I bought him for 4m). I just dont wanna see his face in my club.

footballmanagergames,3cgata,harrison_jones,3,Tue Jul 7 18:07:15 2015 UTC,"Seems like you don't need the half-back as much as you need more attacking power. If you've got a good #10, play 4-4-1-1, pull your wingbacks back (or just play one defend, one attack, ala Abidal/Alves) and that might help you break people down. Typically teams will either just park the bus and let your attacking mid break them down or they'll go all-out to mark the attacking mid and the rest of your team can have more room to breathe.   Change the AP in midfield to CM(s) and you can probably keep the BBM, or you can change him to a BWM. Depending on how good the #10 you get is, you can play him as AP(A) or AM. Personally, with wingers, I'd recommend AP(A). If your striker plays F9 you can probably drop him to AMC and play an out-and-out striker. I find AP(A) + DLF(A) works extremely well in lower-level teams if you have good enough players, just because the opposition can't defend that nearly well enough. You can try a poacher or AF but they don't really contribute to buildup play enough for my taste.  If you're still struggling, high tempo might work better with attacking than control, and you might want to try passing into space if you're really big on winger overlap."

footballmanagergames,3cg7o7,drenndak,2,Tue Jul 7 18:50:35 2015 UTC,"For me, it's absolutely the tactical element. Putting together your ideal gameplan and seeing it work. Developing your own trademark style of football, seeing the journos go on about your patient passing game, etc.  Transfers are fun, that goes with making your side your own. And of course youth management. We all want to train the next legend, to see him thank us for giving him the chance when he wins his first Ballon D'Or and then do the same when he wins the next five."
footballmanagergames,3cg7o7,drenndak,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:47:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your opinion!  We're deciding right now how to put tactical element. Currently we have three ideas.   You make tactics before games and can't influance the game when it's starts. You can have different presets for differnt opponents and tune them as you think correct, but when the game starts - you can do nothing and will only see result, statistics and short review. When game starts you can say some words to the team or to individual players. You can ask about playing safe, keeping themselves calm or trying to make them angry hoping they will crush opponent. Also you can change gameplan a bit, move players from one position to another. After first half you can see result and do the same things. While game goes you will see window with score and statistics and also some kind of ""problem"" you have to solve. For example, player says he doesn't feel confident at some position. And you have some options, like  -move where he wants -move where you think it's better for team -don't move, try to keep him calm -ignore Every decision will influance the game according to player's characteristics and all other factors.   What do you guys like the most?"

footballmanagergames,3ceohn,bell-91,5,Tue Jul 7 09:21:10 2015 UTC,Become Chelsea. Buy a shitload of youngsters and send them on loan. Then either sell them or put them in your first team.  But first: get the best staff.

footballmanagergames,3cexbg,RH-Ajax,2,Tue Jul 7 12:47:00 2015 UTC,Well... you're pumping balls into the box so the creative midfielders will only see the balls flying over their heads  ;)  The tactic doesn't make sense whatsoever..  There are people here giving you advice but it doesn't seem to land with you... That is why I asked before: Do you watch football? Do you know football?

footballmanagergames,3cexbg,as-well,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:16:29 2015 UTC,"That may be the roles they play best at but the tactic is more important as a whole than the individuals in it. If you want those two play makers, stick a defensive midfielder in there.  Plus with those two midfielders being play makers you're probably better off passing the ball and holding possession a little more. If you want the wings pumping the ball in the box then don't waste those centre midfield positions with guys trying to pass it around. Have them sit deeper and protect your defence from the counter"
footballmanagergames,3cexbg,as-well,2,Tue Jul 7 13:42:58 2015 UTC,"If you want to play down the wings, set it up that way - ask your AP(s) to be a CM(s), maybe with riskier passing, and maybe also scrab the DLP. Then have the shoud ""clear ball to flanks"" on, that should help. Float crosses is also hit or miss - what is your success rate for crossings?"
footballmanagergames,3cexbg,as-well,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:01:47 2015 UTC,How do I check my success I can't imagine it's very good even though I play a guy with 16 jumping reach and 17 heading at target man.
footballmanagergames,3cexbg,as-well,2,Tue Jul 7 15:21:53 2015 UTC,I believe its in the stats?
footballmanagergames,3cexbg,bdto711,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:45:55 2015 UTC,Aerial challenges is 60% and crosses attempted is 13%.
footballmanagergames,3cexbg,RH-Ajax,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:53:45 2015 UTC,"Aerial challenges is a defensive statistics. Crossed attempted is the one you are looking for - of all crosses, only 13% got to one of your team player (AFAIK). That is rather bad - one in 9!  How are your wingers at crosses? Good or bad? do you have some other shouts about crosses on, maybe from where they should cross (individual shout)? How is the heading of your target man?  Maybe watch a game or two in full with the current set up and see in 3D where it fails - off the ball movement, pace, heading."
footballmanagergames,3cexbg,bdto711,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:05:03 2015 UTC,Crossing is 12 for one 13 for the other the only crossing tactics set are float and aim for to and his heading is 17 jumping reach 16. They almost never cross to him though. I watched all the friendliest in 3d in full and the first three games of the season it didn't change anything I didn't see that anything was wrong.
footballmanagergames,3cexbg,bdto711,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:09:24 2015 UTC,"Hm, he is a target man, right? I mean it could be that they just suck at crossing. 12 isn't that high."
footballmanagergames,3cexbg,bdto711,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:28:34 2015 UTC,"I'd guess you're gonna lose the midfield very easily and your defence is going to be overwhelmed. In my experience, 2 playmakers doesn't work either and I'm fairly certain opposition teams will have numerous clear cut chances against you"
footballmanagergames,3cexbg,bdto711,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:50:57 2015 UTC,I agree. I also think the wingers are a bit to offensive and the instructions aren't really good. The players are probably not very technical so 'high tempo' will result in a lot of wrong passes. 'Play wider' will also make the midfield and defense vulnerable.
footballmanagergames,3cexbg,RH-Ajax,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:02:01 2015 UTC,I followed this http://www.fmscout.com/a-tactical-guide-pairs-and-combinations.html guide and it said that deep lying and advanced playmakers could be used together. How do I stop the overwhelming of my defence or should I just download someone else's tactics.
footballmanagergames,3cert6,ArmstrongsUniball,2,Tue Jul 7 10:08:12 2015 UTC,"I never complicate it in LLM, the players aren't good enough to operate ramdeuters and IWBs well for example.  I used to play either direct play with a target man, or use fast wingers to get forward.   On occasion I'd try a AM or ST trequirtista with a deeper defence if I had a decent enough player for it, and the occasion called for it to try the smash and grab. (Got a few scalps in cups this way)  Pace helps a lot in LLM, much more than higher leagues. You can get a mediocre striker and he might score a bucketload purely by outpacing the defence. Same with wingers and attack minded midfielders. If he gets a couple of yards space, he can start running."
footballmanagergames,3cert6,dufcdarren,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:48:45 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with the pace statement. I have the third fastest team in the league and my ST has scored more than 20 goals every season based solely on this.   I don't really overcomplicate things too much. I play attacking, fluid football with fast tempo, direct passing, hitting early crosses, shoot on sight, clear ball to flanks I think."
footballmanagergames,3cert6,predsfan77,2,Tue Jul 7 12:30:58 2015 UTC,"Pretty much the same 4-4-2 with either attacking or counter against teams I'm predicted to lose to. Play higher tempo, close down more often, and route 1."

I'm up to 5th in the conference north with worcester at the beginning of March in year 1, was as low as 15th in December when making the change."
footballmanagergames,3cert6,ClandestineMovah,2,Tue Jul 7 16:41:11 2015 UTC,"From my experiments in Swedish 2nd division North, it seems like any type of possession based football does the trick. A lot of times the players ""refuse to listen"" and randomly kick the ball off to opponents without even being challenged... But as long as they keep to the ""short simple passing"" and keeping possession like I instructed them to, I only get goals allowed from the top teams on occasion.   I usually end up losing anyway after the first season, because all the players refuse to stay in the team even though we went from bottom to 2nd place, and I can't find good replacements. Even starting from 2013 and knowing what players IRL are still in the team, they never stay in the game. But in terms of strategy on the field, it works great."

footballmanagergames,3cdssf,showmethefever,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:49:26 2015 UTC,I scout the individual players on the team. Usually I go to like the World Cup or Euro or whatever qualifying in Europe and go through the youth teams where I assign scouts to individual players who catch my eye.
footballmanagergames,3cdssf,CurtisManning,2,Wed Jul 8 04:21:08 2015 UTC,"To find good young players and newgens, I usually do this :   Make a search filter with all the 47 characteristics at 15+. Nobody should pop up (or buy him instantly !!), but that's normal. Set the age filter like you want, usually less than 23.  Reduce the numbers of characteristics accordingly. 10 characteristics at 15+ is a good compromise. Any young player who has ten 15+ charac are the stars of the future. (Gerson, Depay usually are the only ones) Broaden the search. You play with this filter. Twelve 14+ charac is also good to spot young players, fourteen 13+ is really good for promising all-rounded guys.   It usually works for me but you need to send your scouts out there to have a decent world database."

footballmanagergames,3cc9bj,Josoo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:35:18 2015 UTC,"No, you buy him at a young age. Let him develop in your youth squad.

TIs are Direct Passing, Pump Ball Into Box, Look For Overlap, and Play Wider. Huge focus on crossing, with the WBs set to run wide with the ball and cross from the byline, while the IFs are instructed to play narrow, be more patient and hold up the ball while crossing from deep. the CM(A) is very free and tends to act as more of a second striker, while the RGA acts as that central playmaker role and is instructed to get further forward, essentially making him a BBM.

footballmanagergames,3cbirw,jorshrod,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:57:22 2015 UTC,"The star ratings fluctuate greatly. They're influenced a lot by form and, especially, by the talents of the other players on your team. So, a guy will drop if your team as a whole got better, because he's now worse in comparison.  When evaluating guys on loan, just look at their stats. That's the only way to tell how good he actually is."
footballmanagergames,3cbirw,KJones77,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:55:44 2015 UTC,Probably goes without saying but make sure you've got someone with decent JCA/JPA scouting them too or take it into consideration when looking at the scout report.
footballmanagergames,3cbiqc,Seungjin95,2,Mon Jul 6 16:57:03 2015 UTC,"What I tend to do is set the players asking price high on his transfer status. Say 50M+ depending on how you rate the player...  Then when they come asking to leave to a certain club, reply by saying ""only if they match our valuation of you."" They agree and usually the club don't put a bid in because it's out of their price range.  It has worked all the time for me so far. I'm 9 seasons into a save..."
footballmanagergames,3cbiqc,moggeridge,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:57:36 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much what I do as well. Only time it hasn't worked was when Real Madrid actually matched my valuation for De Gea. I wasn't happy I had to sell, but I got an insane price for him so I could get over it.   For me, personally, I don't like the idea of holding onto all your best players forever. The game gets boring if your team stays the same year after year so I pretty much always tell wantaway players that I will sell if a reasonable bid comes in. Most of the time you can find a strong replacement for cheaper anyway so it won't hurt you too much, and you can use the excess to fund other transfers or club improvements."
footballmanagergames,3cbiqc,jahartz,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:02:37 2015 UTC,"Let him go. Not worth the fight. However, if what you said is true about the last guy, try to buy him back on the cheap. Then keep an eye on this guy and if the same thing happens to him, buy him back. Or, if not, just use the money you get to get somebody just as good, but (again) cheaper. Since player interactions are broken in the game, forcing him to stay will do nothing but piss off everybody.  The only way I've been able to avoid people leaving is asking them what it would take to keep them if a bid materializes or convincing them that we can accomplish their goals here (only use this one if you actually can though, because it's a promise you're making to them). I love when the former works because typically they just ask for a pay raise, which I'm more than willing to give them most of the time. So, if you want to give it a shot, go with either of those. it may or may not work, but I guess it's always worth a shot."
footballmanagergames,3cakav,james_89,3,Mon Jul 6 11:57:46 2015 UTC,"If you have enough assignments available to you so that you can cover all the competitions that will have relevant talent for you, then I can't see the harm in that.

footballmanagergames,3cb7td,jackgoat,3,Mon Jul 6 15:34:01 2015 UTC,"Players with higher natural fitness decline considerably slower, so it's important to look at that attribute to determine how many years you'll get out of the striker.  Mental attributes are also important as it means your striker will be able to score even if his other stats are declining.  I would only use star ratings to judge youngsters' potentials, nothing else.  I only buy young players if I think I would use them in 10 or more games (counting bench appearences) in a season, otherwise their development will be slowed.  Also buy youth players in positions you think you'll need players soon, i.e. If you have a 33 year old CB etc."

footballmanagergames,3cb7td,RH-Ajax,3,Mon Jul 6 16:40:50 2015 UTC,"You've uploaded Benzema twice  ;)  I think 34 mil for Benzema is not that bad but the signing fee (16,75 mil!) and the agents fee is ludacris! Also the salary is insane but I guess that's what he is used to at Madrid. But if you have the money and want to spend it, just go for it. I would personaly go for a great younger player who is not expensive and will grow into a player like than Benzema or Falcao; or even better.  What do you mean with: ""How do I invest wisely in youth player""?  The star rating is a great indication. It shows you how good a player is compared to your own players. Even more important: it shows the potential of a player. But don't focus on the star to much! It can change a lot, sometimes even more then once during a season. I would advice you to have a good look at the important trades a player has for the position you want him for,"

footballmanagergames,3ca8i0,djipaloz,3,Mon Jul 6 09:33:18 2015 UTC,"There is too much to cover but I can tell you some of the more common mistakes I made when I switched to the new FM.   Morale is everything   It doesn't matter if you've the best team in the world. If they're unhappy then you'll not win anything. If you're not 100% sure about team talks designate it to an assistant who has good stats for team talks. Motivation and man management I think are two.   Dont change your tactics   Don't change your tactics mid-season. Try and use pre-season to find something that give you good results. Find a tactic that makes use of the players you have. Have a lot of good midfielders, then play five across the middle, etc.  If you're at this stage in FM then I suggest you pick a team which has dominance easily like Celtic, Rangers, I'm sure others can suggest better (I don't have FM15) Do this so you can learn a tactic that works which you can save and bring over to other teams as a backup tactic."
footballmanagergames,3ca8i0,ClandestineMovah,3,Mon Jul 6 14:11:33 2015 UTC,"Definitely seconding the morale comment, also, have you gone straight into Man City or have you managed smaller teams first?  I can never hit the ground running straight into a large club, Ajax are a good starting point to get going from - they've got the talent and not much major competition in the league - build a reputation there and within a season or two you'll be invited to interview for bigger EPL clubs."

footballmanagergames,3ca0f0,Pakigooner,5,Mon Jul 6 08:36:49 2015 UTC,globe -> country of choice -> transfers -> youth intake then select all -> right click -> scouting

Some people don't use this because they equate it to cheating or bending the rules or maybe break of immersion, but it's so much faster."

I believe lfcmarshall does a good one but I'm unsure how up to date he goes before moving on to the next one. Might be one out there though. Do you not want to wait until the transfer window is over anyway? It'll be out of date in a couple of days as soon as someone buys a player irl   Alternatively if you can afford it buy fm15! Not that expensive now :)

I also use FM14 currently and tried to update with custom stuff, but none of the things I tried worked. So I'll just wait and see if the FM16 is better than the FM15 was, or if a competitor will rise to the challenge and make a good game."

footballmanagergames,3ca421,RH-Ajax,6,Mon Jul 6 11:12:25 2015 UTC,"you know you're doomed to failure right? theres no possible way to keep that many promising youth happy, nor give them enough playtime to develop.  if i were you id stick it for a year, keep only the absolute best and sell the rest with buyback clauses just in case they come good.  if only theyd accept affiliate loan offers"

footballmanagergames,3ca421,jamiew0w,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:23:42 2015 UTC,"squad status is something YOU define, you could easily change thei status to first team/key player if you wanted but it won't change anything. lol  castilla wont help as much as you think, for several reasons. many of the players you bought are too good for it and had too high a fee involved to sit in your reserves.   to make matters worse, your ai manager for that team is going to slowly ruin everything. they dont know how to cycle out players properly nor use them in the right roles (that you want then to grow into!). i dont know if you can tutor players in b teams either but that might be irrelevant seeing as you already sold the tutors, lol.  for what its worth i spend more time and money on youth and regens and the only players i let near my b team are either those coming out of injury, those that have graduated out from u19 (and not sure about) and anyone i want to keep 100% for homegrown reasons. otherwise they're on loan with clubs or with main team being tutored/subbed in/minor cup games."
footballmanagergames,3ca421,jamiew0w,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:48:46 2015 UTC,Maybe I should have mentioned it... what you see there are the players from all 4 Real Madrid teams:    Real Madrid Real Madrid B (Castilla) Real Madrid C Real Madrid U19
footballmanagergames,3ca421,jamiew0w,3,Mon Jul 6 10:43:47 2015 UTC,"Sorry, looking back on it I came across harsh when I mean to be, uh, helpful, so I'll try again and i'll try explain it better.  So, what exactly are you planning on achieving? Your youngest is I think Passlack who is 16 so let's use him as a baseline.  You've commited to him at a great age, if he stays with your club (loans don't count) 4 out of the next 5 years he'll qualify as 100% homegrown, both club and country which is awesome. You'll need players like him in a few years to properly register squads for the CL. I guess you're going to leave him with the b-team for at least 2 seasons but after that you'll have a much better plan for your team. The thing is, in those 4 transfer windows, are you going to be snapping up lots of youth again? Sure there are lots of really good youth available at the start but regens start arriving almost immediately and if you get someone better than passlack, are you going to keep both around until they hit 22-24 and mature better? Do you even have the staff available to deal with as big a youth/u19 setup, they're notoriously hard to come by - anyone good always wants to work with first team.   Moving on, you've (in my opinion) done a lot of damage to your team for the next 1-2 seasons. Luckily you're RM so it mightn't matter too much in la liga, but you'll have trouble in the CL. I don't even think you can field a full team of players that have experience of some form and again, that's totally survivable. What you'll notice is a lot of people starting games nervous and making mistakes and this includes the best youth you've gotten like Tielemans and Nathan. The main problem here is if you sub them off a lot or rotate them out too much their morale will drop and coupled with that they're (maybe) not being tutored which doesn't help. That's assuming you can play them reliably at all. As it is team morale will be damaged anyway due to the massive changes you've made.  To add to this, any striker/AM/winger youth you have are going to seriously struggle for at least 5 years to break through. Throughout that other clubs are going to be trying to poach them and before you know it you'll have 10 promises of ""more first team"" on your hands, which you realistically can't fulfill. That's not including any ""%age increase wage demands"", new contracts or the like. It could even be worse as some of them might not even be able to be registered for your teams due to having too many non-EU players.  The hard part is figuring out where do you go from here. I'm going to assume your transfer budget is dry, otherwise you really need a proper backup keeper. Casillas is flaky and old and I doubt your 16 y/o is ready to hop in against Atletico or any decent opponent, lol. After that I'd make my mind up after pre-season what 95% of your starting team will be and it's important that you don't deviate from this too much. Take everyone under 19 and put them in u19 or castilla, then move a select few back again if you want to bring them with your first team for the season. Realistically, you've 3 defenders, Ramos, Marcelo and Carvajal. If any of these get injured at all, you're going to start dropping points.   Lastly, if your star striker is only reaching 2 stars don't worry about it. They're calculated against the other players in your team and Ronaldo is warping it. I think you've done enough transfer activity for 2 whole years, let alone one window lol. One thing to take away from all this is that signing the youth is by far the easiest part. Remember, if it was that easy everyone would be doing it :P"

I still got 151 mil for transfers and 100 mil unused for wages because this is Real Madrid. It helped that most of the people that I sold had huge undeserved salaries; I therefore made a much bigger profit than usual by spending less. I also gave minimum bonuses when winning competitions, I made sure not to play someone any more if it meant that his salary would have gone up, etc. Sorry, my English is bad. I only lost like 7 or 8 mil for stupid mistakes when I wanted to test stuff (but I was too stupid to save before)."

This type of thing can happen fairly often but there are things you can do to try and avoid it like changing your tactics and substituting players. Sometimes however the game just decides to screw you. The good thing at least is that sometimes you can win games in the final minutes too

footballmanagergames,3c9qfa,Exwind,3,Mon Jul 6 05:05:12 2015 UTC,"If it's winning, the tactic doesn't change. Although, if I get a player who is too good to pass up but can't play in the existing tactical setup, I try tweaking the original tactic just enough to fit him. (Example: Changing from 442 to 4411 with a shadow striker)"
footballmanagergames,3c9qfa,Velaryon,3,Mon Jul 6 06:07:11 2015 UTC,"It's difficult because, like, I love the narrow diamond/4-3-1-2, so I'll build my club around that. And then after a couple Champions' Leagues and a massive transfer budget, I'll think I want some big names, some massive signings to bring in and really stack the team...but by that point, yaknow, I've got all my depth figured out, all the players at the club are tailored around that narrow formation. So if I suddenly want to play 4-2-3-1, I've got no wingers and 4 strikers competing for that place.  Usually that's when you go to a new club, start fresh, but if I don't want to switch clubs I'll just resign and go on a prolonged holiday ala Guardiola. I try to come back and see how things have changed. Usually they sell my best prospects and depth players and buy people for absolutely no reason, so you've got to pick the pieces up."

footballmanagergames,3c97n1,trenthamboy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:59:17 2015 UTC,"It's hard to get a price that you think is fair when your league and club is not very reputable, I've got the Georgian league to 6th in the rankings, and my players are still undervalued, if my best players were at Real/PSG/Arsenal/Milan they'd be worth £40m+, but at my club they're worth between £10m and £15m.  What I done in the early years of my Dinamo Tbilisi save, was to try and sell players to the highest possible reputation clubs for as much as I could get with the 50% of next transfer clause on. It doesn't net you money instantly, and may never do, but you could end up with a pretty big windfall of cash if you sell 2 or 3 players a season that can be easily replaced.  If you need instant cash, the best thing to do, is not have an asking price set, and see what offers come in, then try and negotiate up. If you can't get upfront cash, add clauses that you know will be met, like if they're already in their national team, add a hefty after x international appearances clause. Clubs tend to offer more money when they are through addons rather than upfront cash."

footballmanagergames,3c8bn5,ClandestineMovah,2,Mon Jul 6 03:40:49 2015 UTC,"Hahaha. While the game can certainly be easier once you understand the basic concepts, winning all the time - even with a world class team - isnt easy, its easier, sure, but a lot of the game is tactics."

While the game can certainly be easier once you understand the basic concepts, winning all the time - even with a world class team - isn't easy, its easier, sure, but a lot of the game is tactics.   I think that depends on the experience of the player. Once you've found a tactic that works for the players you have then changes to it only need to be subtle to accommodate new players into your team and to keep the A.I guessing.  Once you have two EPL winning teams you could give them a flat defensive 4-4-2 and the players would use what little creative freedom they have to make the tactic work.  If you sign only young players and training them from 15/16 so they know the system and have stats which are specifically for your system then you'll never need to make a marquee signing, or very rarely.  The reason I say this is because I've done it, several times. Almost complete domestic dominance and the latter stages of the ECL every year. For me, playing an EPL team becomes boring very quickly and I end up becoming a selling club to keep the game interesting."

The A.I may well spend 10m + on a 15 or 16 year old player but they'd never put him in the first team much (if at all) in the first season. They wouldn't prioritize him. They wouldn't nurture him by playing him in a superb team so his ratings were excellent over the course of a season.  That's why this example player goes on to be the best in the world and that's why I (and evidentially you) can dominate.  You're Dutch, yeah?  I think there is a lot to be said for living a life of football. I think some people come to this game and think they'll be great after it after a couple of years. It takes a little while longer than that and been born to country which is fanatical about football certainly helps because you're likely to have discovered CM/FM earlier and a lot of footballing principals are second nature.   I do every task myself; so I never use a Director of Football or anything, handle all contracts, transfers etc.    Me too.

Well, not unless you class Neuer...  As you say, unless a player is a natural in a position it can severely hinder you in the long term. Those players would be harder to find and as a result you'll have less players to choose from.  You can train a player in another position but you know you'll be hurting his potential and you know he'll never truly be as good as a player who is a natural in that position.  I played a system with wing backs in my previous save. It was really effective but even then I saw the hindrance of not playing full backs."

At some point I would be perfectly content buying a game called Liverpool Manager because I needed no other features.  In FM13 I discovered the joys of taking a small club from a small nation and building them up for eventual Champions League glory - namely Finn Harps from second Irish league. The problem? Now Finn Harps have established themselves as my only choice for the small club challenge, just like Liverpool are for the big club :D I'm just ridiculously, illogically loyal, I guess.

From the stats, I'd guessing they're sitting deep and making it difficult for you to pass through them and create good chances. You're probably having a lot of rushed shots, blocked shots and long shots."

footballmanagergames,3c7rrz,He_Who_is_Something,2,Sun Jul 5 20:57:13 2015 UTC,"There's currently  dispute in the MLS about the definition of what counts as a ""foreign player"". This matters because the squad has restrictions, such as the number of foreign players allowed.  However, there are some Canadian teams that play in the MLS. An American is not considered foreign to any teams playing in the MLS (regardless if that team is in the USA or Canada), but a Canadian is considered foreign to the American teams in the MLS but not to the Canadian teams in the MLS.  So, the challenge is to pick a Canadian team in the MLS and take them to glory, but by treating Americans as foreign players. Also, as an added bonus to the challenge, you can take over the Canadian national team."

footballmanagergames,3c75mv,RH-Ajax,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:54:43 2015 UTC,I think it looks really good. The regista is a smart choice as well; exactly for the reason you said.   I wanted to say: maybe you should let Toprak push a little bit back to avoid being run-over but now I'm looking closely and I see the 'half back' role for Bender. Interesting! I had to look this up; I've never used this role but I think it makes your central defenders stronger. So Toprak could come into midfield a bit more ofter.  The striker position depends on the qualities of the striker. Attacking Forward or Complete Forward probably. I would just take a look at what fits the player best.  I would just try it like this. I think it looks really good!
footballmanagergames,3c75mv,RH-Ajax,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:07:09 2015 UTC,"I've neglected the half back role, its almost like having a third centre back, therefore why I used CWB's to add more width. Kramer suits the RGA role perfectly, therefore why I wanted to try it! Drmic has started pre season fantastically, so im leaning towards him, I also have a 3412 formation set up if youd want to see."

footballmanagergames,3c75mv,Lupo9699,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:30:37 2015 UTC,"Half back is a great role - it works really well if you have attacking fullbacks, because when your team is attacking your fullbacks bomb up the flanks and your half back drops right back basically into cb, creating a three at the back. Love that role."
footballmanagergames,3c86aa,jcCornelius,2,Sun Jul 5 20:23:15 2015 UTC,"I'm currently playing with one that the game calls a 4-2-4.

footballmanagergames,3c4rph,KJones77,7,Sun Jul 5 05:47:06 2015 UTC,My striker was injured for 4 months and after about 3 games since he returned to training his match fitness was still only like 70% and he had the audacity to march into my office to complain
footballmanagergames,3c4rph,ronaldo119,4,Sun Jul 5 11:46:18 2015 UTC,You mean limp into your office?  At 70% i wouldn't consider him fit enough to get out of bed
footballmanagergames,3c4rph,Gilwath,4,Sun Jul 5 11:53:58 2015 UTC,"Yea exactly, I was only able to give him 45 minutes of reserve time before he complained. Like he thought after missing 4 months he'd be able to step right back into the squad like he didn't miss a beat"
footballmanagergames,3c4rph,ronaldo119,4,Sun Jul 5 11:58:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I would like to see a change to the AI in FM16, but my guess is that we will have to wait a loong time. Sometimes it can be hard to keep a team satisfied with AI like this. But i guess its not their priority number 1."
footballmanagergames,3c4rph,Trabjerg,3,Sat Jul 4 20:23:29 2015 UTC,"There needs to be a fair amount of change here. The whole game works well, just that some interaction is very biased. (i.e players wanting to transfer out for you vs ai, ai will literally never sell them, you basically have to or your player just bitches and lowers team morale)."

footballmanagergames,3c7ar9,Exwind,2,Mon Jul 6 05:10:19 2015 UTC,I wouldn't be worried about what the game names the formation. Once it seems balanced and works I wouldn't worry about it. Maybe try and asymmetrical midfield (one CM and one DM) and see if that works?
footballmanagergames,3c7ar9,Quinn155,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:23:02 2015 UTC,"They will work properly it's the way FM registers. For example I always use a 4-1-2-2-1/4-3-3 similar to the formation Baralona use but when playing the right and left wingers as inside forwards it said the formation was 4-3-3 but when I changed their roles to Winger(S) it said the formation was 4-1-4-1, despite not changing any players position just their roles in the system."

If I'm not wrong (may have changed on the updated DB) I think Samper has/had a release clause around £10m-£11m. Most of the time he opts to stay with Barca but at times you can get him. :)"

footballmanagergames,3c3jq0,InsiderInsight,8,Sat Jul 4 12:33:04 2015 UTC,I was exactly the same when I started playing.  The best way to see if a player is good is to highlight the stats relevant to their playing position. You can do this by looking at their scout/coach report and clicking their position from the drop down box around the right of the screen. Another way to see if a players stats are good I find is to compare a player to other players who are good and see how similar the stats are. I hardly pay any attention to star ratings at all after doing those things!
footballmanagergames,3c3jq0,lm__x,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:33:29 2015 UTC,This will probably not be as effective if your playing with masking of players skills.(which I don't). Else it's really great

footballmanagergames,3c3jq0,ClandestineMovah,5,Sat Jul 4 14:00:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the writeup, it actually gave me some ideas.

footballmanagergames,3c3jq0,Animasta,6,Sat Jul 4 15:24:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the writeup, it actually gave me some ideas.    My pleasure, glad to be of help.   But what the OP means is that sometimes a 4-star player seems to be worse than a 3-star player when looking at career stats and attributes, and he's asking how to evaluate these players better.   Ahhhh  I'm bit slow sometimes.  OP, if you catch this then the word you're looking for is vague, as in, the stars are a vague representation.  They alter, not infrequently and can go both up and down in a season given on varying factors. The stars are obtained (and forgive me if you already know this, I'm not being condescending) from within the squad report from three main factors.   The assistant managers judging players ability and potential. The assistant managers reputation. The other players in the team.   The first two points are to determine their value to you and as you might expect, they're pretty vague because there's only five stars, one half a star to five. Here is where it get's awkward. The stars are relative to each other, or to be specific, the star ratings of the players are relative to each other.  The best way I can describe it is if you had a machine to clone people. If you had ten players who were all identical in every single way and they were rated at three stars and you signed Memphis Depay then the other ten players would be rated as half of a star either immediately (in a couple of days) by your assistant. Most players look bad alongside MP, he's not a shabby footballer.  I more 'real life' example would be if you were half way through your season and the 18 year old who was struggling at the beginning of the season recently had a jump in form and his training stepped up and he's improved. As a result is overall ability is better and now the ratings have changed.  But instead of his stars going up you in fact you see everyone else's stars go down. Crap, this is terrible!  Actually, no. Everyone else's ratings have gone down only because they're compared to this young lad. He's starting to show his real qualities and now the assistant has a better handle on just how good this kid is. This is, in fact, great news because this tells you this lad is going to be great.  I might have rambled a bit sheepish But hopefully that made some sense."
footballmanagergames,3c3jq0,FrostyJesus,3,Sat Jul 4 17:52:10 2015 UTC,"the thing that broke that habit for me is noticing how up and down the stars actually were; I have two wingers in my Vaduz save, and one of them, whilst not nearly as fast, has way better mental stats. However, since I was using my super fast winger more often and he was getting the business done, he had a better star rating. He wanted a move to Parma and I granted him one at the end of the season, so I started using my other winger instead. He started doing the business too, and his star rating jumped up from 2 to 3."
footballmanagergames,3c3jq0,Animasta,3,Sat Jul 4 14:37:37 2015 UTC,"Star ratings are also based off the quality of that player compared to the rest in your team. So if a better winger left, it makes sense that this guy's rating increased."
footballmanagergames,3c3jq0,anteni2,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:27:42 2015 UTC,"He was still there though, I wanted my other winger to get starts to see if he'd be good enough to step up to the first team, which he was.  (unfortunately he's made of glass)"
footballmanagergames,3c3jq0,RH-Ajax,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:37:13 2015 UTC,"Well the stars aren't exactly a perfect science. A) They depend on the judging ability of your scouts/coaches and B) they're relative to the rest of the squad. So you could have two strikers in your squad with two stars and then buy a striker because he's got five stars, but that's only actually in comparison with the other two strikers (if that makes any sense), not the rest of the league or the rest of the options out there.   I'd say stars are a good second opinion but ideally you want to be looking at stats as well, and comparing transfer targets by stats as much as star rating.   Edit: Also, don't rule out form under player history. Sometimes I buy cheap players because they've always had solid 7 ratings for their previous seasons. Sometimes I don't buy players because their average rating is terrible for how good they're supposed to be."

We managed to turn it around and went on an unexpected run of good form. We finished in 6th place and clinched a space in the play offs. We went on to annihilate Norwich in the semi's but lost out to Derby (iirc) in the final.  Season 2 - 7 or 8 new signings came in during the summer and we had a much better start. We stuck with the top 5 for a while and were looking set to secure at least a play off place. We couldn't quite hold onto an automatic promotion spot so were braced for the madness of play offs once again. We made it to the final yet again only to score a dramatic 90th minute equaliser and crash out 4-5 on penalties.  Season 3 (ongoing): Only made 2 changes to the roster over the summer and said goodbye to a few faces. We've had an amazing start to the Championship. We're currently unbeaten after 14/15 games and are sitting 11 points clear at the top. This could finally be our year!

I've finished 4th, 6 times in a row now, because the team likes to slump in the second half of the season. Finished runner up in Poland cup 5 times straight. The Poland Cup dosnt offer a huge cash reward, but it provides enough to at least fund 2 first team players. (In Poland at least, the average salary for first team players is $15,000 p/m). Anyways, the AI is pretty bad when it enters the international league, and Germany likes to just pick all the leading players in Poland, even if they are foreign.

And as good as those players are, I'd set Carvajal to an automatic WB and keep Rodriguez as attacking. This may help to remove some of the ""occasional losses"" by having a couple of slightly more conservative defenders."
footballmanagergames,3c4j1n,walvincraith,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:11:01 2015 UTC,I feel the roles that you set for the two midfielders are lacking in defending duties and so will make the team more vulnerable?  The defensive changes though are a real improvement I feel to the current tactic.
footballmanagergames,3c4j1n,shiranughie,2,Sat Jul 4 19:12:19 2015 UTC,"IMO, your problem is that you set your team mentality to control whereas your formation is attacking. There's no point of constraining your team and think about defending with that kind of formation. Control mentality is not the only way to play possession football.  As for the duo midfielders, it's best that you set Pogba as BBM, and Moutinho as CM-Support duty. WBs as FBs with attack duty, and GK as SK.  This is my formation: http://i.imgur.com/78jyXzV.png | http://i.imgur.com/nn1SZb5.png  I've been ruling BPL for the past 4 years now with this formation.

Was playing as atletico and bid on a promising Dutch winger, my scout said 8-15 mil so I made bids of 9,10,12, and then 15 mil all of which were flat out rejected, no negotiation even.   Then Inter signs him for 1.7 mil. Yes, 1, as in less than 2.

Later, they learn that it was actually Professor Quirrell casting the enchantment to knock Harry off of his broom because Lord Voldemort had attached his soul to Professor Quirrell's, and Snape was trying to save Harry the whole time.

footballmanagergames,3bz2pr,toe-head,6,Fri Jul 3 14:28:47 2015 UTC,"I play for Harps in every version since 13, and FM15 is the hardest the game has ever treated me, actually.  This is my third save (two ended in a ragequit), and I never won the Premier League in any of them (won CL eventually both in 13 and 14). Dundalk are unstoppable. Keeping a semi-pro side match fit is nearly impossible in this version. Lots of injuries no matter what level of training I set (lack of fitness, pressing-based tactic and swamp-like pitches to blame, I presume). Even if you field U-19 players for All-Ireland Cup and League Cup and exit them in the first round, the calendar ends up in shambles due to other teams' rescheduled fixtures. Seriously, who needs those cups? If we qualify for Europe as well, we end up playing a game every three days from March to August save for a little summer break. Most annoying bit is the inexplicable slump of form which routinely occurs for no apparent reason once a season, during which we lose every chance to catch up with Dundalk. Argh! Thinking about downloading an exploitative tactic and just win the goddamn thing to put it out of my mind and wait for FM16 where things will hopefully get better."
footballmanagergames,3bz2pr,MessiEsque,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:00:23 2015 UTC,"Know the feeling mate, I tried getting UCD promoted to the Premier League and the constant injuries were unbelievable. Did get promoted but we we're still semi pro so injuries continued and we got wrecked by everyone in the top flight. Left the save after a while.  Came back last week to try and get an Irish team in the champions league group stages so I picked Shamrock Rovers. Start of the season - game on the 6th, 9th and 10th of the month. Ridiculous. I'm guessing the Northern Irish league messes up the All-Ireland Cup schedule?  Going to try get into one last Irish save but honestly the schedules and fitness issues are terrible."
footballmanagergames,3bz2pr,EamusCatuli08,2,Fri Jul 3 17:21:35 2015 UTC,"Oh, good luck with Rovers, then: their squad is far from the best in the league, but the attendance numbers are through the roof compared to all the rest and you're probably allowed to scout the whole of UK & Ireland, which should give you some leeway on the transfer market. Reaching the group stages should be manageable, and after that it's very easy to dominate the domestic league (well, unless FM15 has some nasty surprise there as well :D).  Not sure if the NI teams are to blame: the LoI schedule is pretty hard on its own at the start of the season, squeezing 2 or 4 extra matches in there should complicate everything even further without any help from across the border. As far as I understand, in real life the teams decided not to set up AIC this season for the very same reasons - sadly, it wasn't included into the latest FM patch."

footballmanagergames,3c36zc,limboeden,2,Sat Jul 4 09:08:04 2015 UTC,"One of the things I learned recently in LLM is the value of the non-contract. I know it seems risky, because anyone can come along and poach someone on a non-contract, but I was able to pull in some pretty decent players by signing them first to non-contracts, then to part time contracts.  I also couldn't agree more with /u/Quinn155. Build formations around the players. Sometimes the full backs are just shite, so you have to move to a 3-5-2. In LLM I tried to play with 3 forwards and just overload the opposition. I almost got promoted that season, and we'll never know if I could have, since I moved on to the Ghana setup."
footballmanagergames,3c36zc,mc_zodiac_pimp,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:08:47 2015 UTC,So how many players is too many to have on the non-contract?  Yeah I experimented a bit in pre-season with formations but seeing as I only have one winger in the squad I've settled on either a 5-2-1-2 or a 4-3-1-2. Both have very similar instructions and I just choose which ever one is more suitable to the match day squad and opposition.  I keep leaking goals though. Definitely need to improve my centre defenders.
footballmanagergames,3c36zc,mc_zodiac_pimp,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:11:19 2015 UTC,"I think at one point half my squad were on non-contracts. It was simple: if they weren't up to standard, they didn't' get paid. That's the beauty of a non-contract!   What are the roles for your defensive line? Are you playing with a more fluid, or more rigid mentality? If it were me (and I were playing 4 at the back) I'd play 2 LFBs and 2 LDs with a rigid mentality.  Also, how are the goals coming in against you?"
footballmanagergames,3c36zc,Icarruss,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:40:14 2015 UTC,With my 5-2-1-2 formation I play a fluid mentality. I've got three central defenders and two complete wing backs. DLP (D) and BWM (D) with and Advanced Playmakers on Support in front of them and two advanced strikers. It can work very well away from home on the counter.  I think I've only kept three clean sheets in 25 matches.  A lot of the goals come in against me through set pieces. But also really infuriating stuff like the opposition striker chasing down a ball the my central defender should get but seems to switch off.
footballmanagergames,3c36zc,Icarruss,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:18:38 2015 UTC,They will stay at the club unless you send them away with or some club want them. But they will stay at the club with amateur contract so they will not join trainings fully. I'm managing colwyn bay and i can tell you dont give so much money for any players. No player is irreplaceable. Also be careful about bonuses. Delete yearly rises from the contracts when signing players. These are crucial.
footballmanagergames,3c36zc,Quinn155,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:46:43 2015 UTC,Should I wait until the end of the season to renew contracts?
footballmanagergames,3c36zc,mc_zodiac_pimp,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:07:55 2015 UTC,I usually wait. Also when you wait some of the players accept discounts too.
footballmanagergames,3c36zc,Quinn155,1 point,Sun Jul 5 08:20:36 2015 UTC,"In those lower leagues, especially in your first 2/3 seasons you're probably better building your formation around the players available. Personally I found it next to impossible to find any full backs in my first season with FC United (Dafuge Challenge) so I've resorted to playing a 3-5-2 of sorts with 2 DMs and while it's not ideal, it's pretty solid defensively and decent offensively with set pieces which seem important in the lower leagues.   Another key point in playing in the lower leagues, especially in England, is getting a parent club to get their young players on loans for free, although this can be difficult in your first season depending on your board.   I'd also avoid paying any money for players until at least League one. You can usually get a free player that is just as good as any player you could afford.  And keep an eye out for aging players that are looking for dual staff/player roles. I ended up getting Luis Garcia as a player/coach for a season in League 2 and while his physicals were non existent his technical and mental's made him a key part of my promotion."

I mean, I can't believe everyone at SI is blind to these obvious problems, but Miles comes across like an overbearing, paternalistic boss in every forum interaction/interview, so I wouldn't be surprised if it's his baby and no one wants to cross him."
footballmanagergames,3c301e,danbeans,2,Sat Jul 4 19:45:50 2015 UTC,Honestly the shitty interactions caused me to buy the ingame editor. You can just click on remove unhappiness for the players with particularly dumb problems and all is solved
footballmanagergames,3c301e,Reapppo,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:21:44 2015 UTC,You probably have too many players on the first team squad role in their contract so when signing player if they're only going to be a rotation player then ensure their squad role is that.
footballmanagergames,3c301e,Lord_Storm13,2,Sat Jul 4 10:11:35 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter the squad role. I've had key players not complain about player 5 games in 2 seasons, but players in Youngster roles complain after not playing the first 2 games of the season."
footballmanagergames,3c301e,leicestercity,1 point,Sat Jul 4 11:01:34 2015 UTC,"There are ways to get through it without annoying them. Tell them you'll play em in cup games, they won't accept that so you say you can't go around guaranteeing players when they will play and they are ok with it generally. Also you can tell them they don't have the ambition to play for the club too, usually works especially if you have already gone through the first sequence earlier in the season or whatever."
footballmanagergames,3c301e,Lord_Storm13,1 point,Sat Jul 4 11:31:42 2015 UTC,"I know there's ways to get around their complaining, but it's still pretty ridiculous when players who are in a youngster role wants to play as a first team player."

I've even had a player complain after not playing any of the pre-season friendlies and then missing the first game of the season. Interactions are broken unless you have a small squad where everyone plays 30+ games a season.
footballmanagergames,3c301e,Reapppo,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:19:08 2015 UTC,I don't have a small squad and I have at least 2 good players in each position and I do not get any extra complaints about game time that I wouldn't expect.
footballmanagergames,3c301e,Lord_Storm13,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:26:25 2015 UTC,"The majority of the time I don't, but I've had some come out of nowhere at times. One example is a player on a youngster contract, with 2 key players and a first team player ahead of him in his only trained position, then him complaining after playing 3 of the first ten games. Obviously there's a lot of contributing factors, but sometimes it just doesn't seem right."

Rookie mistakes would be thinking that if you start as a big team in the premier league, like Arsenal or Chelsea, then thinking you'll easily steamroll the smaller teams in the cup competitions. Sometimes, you'll get FM'd, have like 30 shots on target, 60℅ possession and still lose 3-0 because your opponent managed score with their only 3 shots."
footballmanagergames,3c2muf,Reapppo,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:18:50 2015 UTC,I've never really played handheld so I don't know if its the same. Away games are extremely difficult and you will be punished if you're attacking when you shouldn't be.

An hour re-playing the same match, losing every time. And at no point during this time did I think, hey, I should change my tactic. Or anything. The same tactic, the same players every time. I lose every time.  I do eventually give in, naturally I lose players to injury and make some random regen signing before deciding to go to bed.

The date is 07/09/2015, which means he has ""existed"" in the game for about 6 months, as he was created in the very first batch of regens. During the first 2 seasons, De Rossi should be able to hold his ability to around his starting ability of 165. A godlike 15 year old regen will not be able to have a starting rating of anymore than 110 at the most. Considering this player's stats, we're looking at a player in the region of 180-200. As he has passed De Rossi, we're looking at a player, who has grown between 70 and 90 ability points in 6 months (where of at least two have been holiday months).

footballmanagergames,3byntg,Ehler,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:16:23 2015 UTC,"How it would be possible? Well, he has 20 determination, his scout report suggests he has high professionalism aswell, for this to be possible, we will assume he has 20 ambition and 20 professionalism.   If he hits growth spurts every single month, plays games (U21/U19 national teams) during the holidays, has a great tutoring experience (this could be De Rossi, 16 ambition and 18 professionalism, he will move his hidden attributes down, but they would still be fantastic) and plays in a club that has fantastic facilities and a competetive league (check and check).   I'm not sure if it's possible, but if it were to be, that would be the ""how"".  Something that suggests cheating has been involved could be that all his ""low"" stats are around the same mark. (5 being 9, 1 being 8 and 1 being 10.) These are all attributes he would be naturally ineffecient at, if he was bad. (The fact that flair is 2 is not of any matter really, as flair doesn't rise or fall, if you edit the ability)"
footballmanagergames,3byntg,FakUImABear,3,Fri Jul 3 14:21:48 2015 UTC,"I've done all the steps you indicated for maximum possible growth.  Created a perfect tutor and team. 16 year old 110 CA (Above average) with perfect hidden stats, simulated forcing him to being on the first team if possible, he played all the league games but 1 in a 6 month span. He went from 110 to 142, which is already sick growth.  Over 165 doesn't seem something achievable on a 6 month span. I'd go with editor."
footballmanagergames,3byntg,soldado3,2,Fri Jul 3 15:15:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm thinking that too, but if we look at it as a thought experiment, if he hits these ""super spurts"" of growth every single month for 6 consecutive months, he could possibly hit around the 180-200 mark.  The chances would literally be like winning the lottery. Those extra strong growth spurts are rare, but I'm not sure it's 100% impossible, he could rise that much in six months."

So if you play a player every single game, then he will be worth a lot more than another player with exactly the same stats that just sat on the bench. If the AI club never plays a player and then sells him, then that explains the price drop."

Back in FM12 I was managing Preston, and my second year in PL I had an amazing young striker (amazing for Preston at least) that was pumping in goals. Of course in the January window the big clubs get interested, but I would never agree to sell him, but United put in a bid that my board felt was too good to reject, so off he went...  I'm pretty sure he never played a game for United, yet he was still the top (or top 3) goalscorer that season, only having played half the season.... Made me so pissed :("

I reloaned him the next season to help me with the Serie B. He has been good but Devante Cole has been the main goalscorer, however he has gotten fuckloads of assists, here are his stats. I don't know if a player is good or not, but if he plays well in my team, he gets a first choice spot. Christian Tiffert is good too, 14 games, 5 goals, 2 assists. Devante Cole has 14 games, 12 goals and 4 assists. And Scott Mcdonald has 12 games, 9 goals and 3 assists at CAM.  Also Leo Chambers, my left back has 4 assists this season.. But yeah, i think i'm bragging, all of them except Tiffert and Roberto are new to the team, it's cool signing all these players for free or spending so little, and having them perform so amazingly."

footballmanagergames,3bynok,AnnulledMessiah,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:08:10 2015 UTC,I think you have too many players on Attack duty. You don't really need a DLF if you have an attacking midfielder.

footballmanagergames,3bynok,besterich27,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:52:58 2015 UTC,"Good on you creating it on your own then. I think it has to do with the defender AI not being able to handle how the F9s pull off, leaving tons of space and an open goal to chase them down."
footballmanagergames,3bynok,Urbiscuit18,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:06:06 2015 UTC,Well that is the False 9s point in real life anyways. It works as intended.
footballmanagergames,3bynok,besterich27,2,Fri Jul 3 20:09:32 2015 UTC,"It's generally considered unbalanced when a specific tactic can bamboozle the AI to an extent that no other tactic can because of a specific hole in the player AI.   But yes, that is the idea of a false 9. It just works too well in FM15. That's why all the popular downloadable exploit tactics use the two F9 or two Trequartista setup.  There's always stuff like this in FM, it just differs based on the year and sometimes the patch. As long as you're having fun.  EDIT: And honestly there's nothing wrong with stumbling across the most effective tactic all on your own. That's just a job well done as a virtual manager. I just thought it was important to note in the context of the discussion that maybe having an imbalanced team in favor of attacking roles won't work using a ""normal"" tactic."
footballmanagergames,3bynok,besterich27,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:19:20 2015 UTC,"Oh, yeah, I understand your point now. Normal attacking formations might not work as well. You're right.

TL;DR  When it comes to hidden attributes, you want your regen to get high Professionalism and Ambition. The problem with amitious players it that they will have low loyalty.   Model Citizen/Model Professional/Professional are the best ones, these are perfect for tutoring. Perfectionist is very good as well.  It's also smart to use a similar personality player, as they will like eachother more and therefore the tutee will improve more. I always prioritize a better personality.

footballmanagergames,3bvf2b,fenntastic,7,Thu Jul 2 13:50:44 2015 UTC,I've seen this sort of thing posted on this sub before and I still don't understand what the problem is people have with this.
footballmanagergames,3bvf2b,Ikestar,-6,Thu Jul 2 16:22:27 2015 UTC,You don't see the issue with a club demanding 200m for their star player? No doubt said club puts in a truly derisory offer for your star player. This aspect of the game has been broke for a while now.
footballmanagergames,3bvf2b,rodders0223,30,Thu Jul 2 17:03:32 2015 UTC,"No I don't see a problem there. Honestly, I don't. Liverpool do not want to sell their star player and brightest prospect, they will inform you of their position when you enquire about the player. If you then choose to talk numbers by suggesting an offer, they will demand you fork over an absurd amount of money not to invite you to bid again, but to hammer home the message that the player is not for sale. They aren't entertaining your offer because they have no desire to.   That is, unless you're willing to offer so much money they'd have to be crazy not to take it, the player isn't moving. Unless of course if you can make the player demand a transfer, in which case the club is compelled to be slightly more reasonable. I don't see a problem with a club wanting to hold on to talented players or future stars. I quite like it, in fact. Because honestly, if the club has the capital to pay the player, and the player has no great desire to leave, why should they ever even tolerate you asking them ""how much"", if the answer is ""not for sale, sod off"" it only makes sense for the club to be a bit unreasonable when you start talking money. In my view, a truly broken game is one in which a high-reputation, wealthy club says ""not for sale"" only to go ""j/k 40 milllion quid he's yours"" when you inform them you'll be paying in money.   And oh no! Teams try to lowball you for players to see if you're stupid enough to take an offer? You mean, players that you've listed for transfer and likely gave a 'not needed' squad status? Or do you mean that these are players you don't want to sell and will likely demand an obscene amount of money for, you know, the way every FM user in existence has done, and the way AI teams do now. Other teams trying to poach your players, unsettle them and having a go at your squad harmony is one of the few things in this game that are still challenging after a while.   There's plenty of infuriating bs in the FM series, but none of this is. Clubs that don't want to sell players have unreasonable demans when you insist they put a number on him. Clubs try to buy your players for less than you want for them. So, I repeat my original question: why is any of that a problem?   Hell, if you want something to complain about, why is no club in the world willing to buy my servicable rightback valued at 120k FOR FREE with a 20% sell-on fee? I mean seriously, he's free. You pay no money and if you sell him for no money again I'll get nothing. I should be getting sick of accepting offers for this guy by now but nope! ""no clubs interested"" really? Not even in the sixth tier of english football is there a club that says ""well gee, we've got no transfer budget but we've got a few quid in the wage budget to stretch for this guy, so let's try it! Why the fuck not?""   I mean seriously, you complain about people low-balling your star players' values in transfer offers? Fuck me, I'm extatic when someone makes an offer for a player I've listed."

footballmanagergames,3bvf2b,Ikestar,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:29:09 2015 UTC,"Because you've started to talk numbers. If you'd send an enquiry, they'll tell you ""he's not for sale, offer rejected"" if you then insist on making an offer anyway, they will tell you how much money it will take them to sell you the player.  You realize that they will accept the crazy amount offer for that player, right? So you can buy Sterling if you've got 198 million quid lying around and absolutely no common sense."
footballmanagergames,3bvf2b,-TrollBuster-,1 point,Fri Jul 3 09:28:47 2015 UTC,"But that's what AI team do: they send the offer (and they always offer way less than the sell value) without any previous enquiry, and I just refuse by telling that I don't want to sell the player. It would be quite pointless to waste 10 minutes asking for absurd amounts of money just to let them abandon the negotiation. That's why I'd expect them to act this way: if you don't want to sell the player than refuse my offer and say that you don't want to sell the player, that's all. I find it more realistic than asking 119M € for a 19 years old gk."

They start off with a reasonably young squad, so a fair few guys improve enough that you don't have to replace them as you move up the league. The only real downside to them is they are pretty tight money-wise (only bought in one player in the 1st season), and my training and youth facilities got downgraded to average in the 2nd or 3rd season and I don't have the cash to improve them yet."

footballmanagergames,3bwxu7,bluesbruin3,3,Thu Jul 2 20:50:48 2015 UTC,"Get whichever version you like. I know a guy who routinely buys one year behind each time so that it's cheaper. It's probably going to be pretty heavy if you jump straight into the main career mode, but there is a lighter, more old-school/arcade version that will be more suitable for newer players, plus a pretty decent tutorial, so don't have any concerns. With regards to football knowledge, well, you should probably have a basic understanding of tactical ideas, or a logical brain, if not both (e.g. why a 4-2-3-1 tends to do well against a flat 4-4-2). Plus, there are lots of player roles in the game that might sound a bit otherworldly at first (enganche, trequartista, regista, libero) but you'll get used to them, and anything complex like that tends to be well-described in-game anyway."
footballmanagergames,3bwxu7,andyff,3,Thu Jul 2 21:03:09 2015 UTC,"I've never played any FM game other than 15 and I think this game is incredible. I can't tell you how complex the previous games are and how different they are but from what I've heard they are a few differences like having the ability to give a touch line team talk is exclusive to FM15 (from what I've heard) and they're super important to me. You can buy FM for £13 from   http://www.cdkeys.com/pc/games/football-manager-2015-pc-mac-cd-key-steam   so it's already really cheap.  Football knowledge is important but isn't always needed. Certain flaws to the game will allow certain tactics to work that just wouldn't work in real life. However they are far and few between. The most important things that I don't see people talk about is the difference from home and away games. Away games are much harder and will often require a tactic change against the bigger sides unless you're a tactical genius like some people I've seen.  When you start I think it's best to try and decide which style of football you want to play too and formation. I often found myself signing players that were just good but didn't fit in my team or have the desired stats for that role.  Get some good scouts and always get scout reports on players before you sign them. I actually recommend getting a report on every player you look at.  Always look at your finances because they're often over looked by new players. Especially your net transfer spend.  Don't get to down beat if you fail at your first job and do not cheat to avoid the sack, it's better to learn from your mistakes rather than ignoring them.   I also recommend downloading a logo and face pack for the game to enhance the experience, if you don't know what the logo and face pack are for you will when you play it.   My last tip would be look online if you need help actually playing the game but when it comes down to tactics and set pieces and all the training stuff I would encourage you to do it on your own, it makes it more fun when you win.  I know you didn't ask for all these tips but I thought I'd help you out and these are all my opinions so if you disagree with them it's totally fine."
footballmanagergames,3bwxu7,Reapppo,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:17:31 2015 UTC,"If you can get 2015 for a good price, go for it. Paying for full-price 16 might not be worth it. Like you'd expect the learning curve is pretty steep.   It's actually kind of difficult for me (and I imagine most people who play FM regularly) to imagine what kind of issues you'll run into. I'll give you a few tips:    don't start in classic mode, just jump into the game's full sim mode since you'll be learning anyway, and the last thing you want to do is move up from classic mode since you'll have to re-learn a bunch of crap which will just feel like busywork.

If you ever feel overwhelmed or like you don't understand anything you're always welcome to post any questions you have here. Or shit, PM me and I'll try to help you out.  Basic tactics, most things like player roles and tactics are pretty well explained in-game.

Not even joking, that's sort of what it's like. You can tell players to do certain things but ultimately you're limited to finetuning your tactic on the fly and hoping for the best. You can do substitutions!  edit: and don't worry about being a noob. We all were at some point."

When I bought FM13 (my first FM), I only knew the rules of soccer, I didn't know about registration rules, tactics, positional roles, or how the transfer markets worked. I learned it all the hard way, because FM was recommended to me as one of the premier sports sim games (my favorite sport, [American] football doesn't have as good quality sims, and the sport most suited to sims, baseball, is my least favorite sport.) It can be daunting, but if you put some effort to it you'll be able to learn it."

footballmanagergames,3bvrk5,justfmthings_I_think,3,Thu Jul 2 15:48:01 2015 UTC,Manually search the u21's of South American Teams. Get scouts from different nations like Brazil and scout there. But in the end scouts don't matter. Manually searching every nation and club is the way to go.
footballmanagergames,3bvrk5,Ikestar,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:50:37 2015 UTC,"This, except maybe not go for Brazilian scouts, their area of expertise often doesn't go beyond Brazil. Argentines are quite common and have a few other countries under their 'knowledge belt'.   U21 and U19 for the smaller Latin American nations is a great way to go though, Bolivia, Venezuela, Peru and Colombia all tend to have at least a couple of wonderful players every couple of years. Definatly worth doing."
footballmanagergames,3bvrk5,jof14,2,Thu Jul 2 18:47:01 2015 UTC,"Further to u/justfmthings_I_think, I would recommend scouting the Youth Intake of other clubs every March. You go to World>Transfers>Youth Intake and scout players that clubs have just brought on board. You can then try poach some jems from other clubs. This can be really effective but some players can cost a pretty penny and then don't fulfill their potential so it's best to have a few of your scouts check out the player to get a more rounded view of the players potential."

footballmanagergames,3bvrk5,Ikestar,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:17:50 2015 UTC,"Some really great ideas here. I'll just add that you can ask the board to find you an affiliate to get foreign talent in. When going through the options they give you, look for clubs with good youth recruitment, that tends to help. If you want to have your own academy kids shine, first off realizing the youth intake system right now is (and always has been) a crapshoot you have basically no control over. In England, get to cat. 1 as soon as you can since it'll help quite a bit. In any case.   If you've got capable veterans, assign them as mentors to your youngsters. Get them on role-specific training early on too. Hire good youth coaches if at all possible."

footballmanagergames,3bvild,specs112,3,Thu Jul 2 14:52:32 2015 UTC,One or two defenders will kill you; what ever you do. Maybe you'll benefit sometimes against very weak teams but all the other teams will destroy you. I sometimes change the tactic during a game and go 'full attack' but it almost never works.  You could try playing with two central defender and attacking wing backs; that could work with a strong midfield.
footballmanagergames,3bvild,RH-Ajax,3,Thu Jul 2 14:29:20 2015 UTC,When you say defenders do you mean centerbacks only? I think youd have to use at least 2 cbs and 2 wingbacks to have a decent defence. Think of how vulnerable your flanks would be with only cbs. Haven't tried to use such tactics so I might be wrong.
footballmanagergames,3bvild,ZiggyMooncheese,2,Thu Jul 2 15:21:30 2015 UTC,"I use 3-1-2-2-2 formation, 3 CBs, DM, 2 CMs, 2 wingers and 2 strikers. Rarely do I get caught out on the flanks as my CBs seem to spread themselves quite well. I may have to try a season with 2 CBs and 2 DMs and see what happens. For science."
footballmanagergames,3bvild,ZiggyMooncheese,2,Thu Jul 2 15:51:39 2015 UTC,"What player roles do you pick for your 3 cbs? I doubt 2 cbs would work against teams who play out wide, but its worth a shot - for science!"
footballmanagergames,3bvild,ClandestineMovah,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:59:25 2015 UTC,All Limited CBs. So they don't mess about. They either clear it or pass it to the cdm straight away. If they don't they normally get bollocked. But I may give 2 CBs a go and see what happens. I have world class players at the moment so they are more likely to succeed surely.
footballmanagergames,3bvild,justfmthings_I_think,2,Thu Jul 2 21:24:57 2015 UTC,"It won't work in practice because one of two things will happen.   They will go ahead and when you try to push for an equalizer they'll hit you on the break and you won't have the players to cover. You'll go ahead and they'll push more men forward (something like the old 4-2-4) and you'll be overwhelmed in defence or forced to pull attacking players back to defend.   What you're looking for is something heavy in CDM & wing backs which give you defensive solidity but also give you the option of bombing forwards. Buy players that are well scouted and have great stamina, off the ball and train them to get forward with PPM's  This is how I like to play too."

After that preferred moves are the next consideration.   I don't like lowering a player's determination through tutoring, but if it means boosting their Ambition and Professionalism and potentially getting them some strong PPMs then I will take the hit. Determination has no influence on development, it just affects them in matches when bad things happen.  The first option allows them to learn the tutor's preferred moves and the second option just affects their mental attributes."

They can work with the youth team; so you can let the the senior coaches focus only on the first team (that includes the U21 team or second team).  Advantage is that the workload of both 'sets' of coaches isn't high. Also: you can specialize more. For example: high stats for 'working with youngsters' are more important for youth coaches than for senior coaches.  It's always a big puzzle but, in my opinion, a nice one!"
footballmanagergames,3bvgwt,RH-Ajax,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:24:36 2015 UTC,"This is correct. For smaller teams or teams which have poor facilities it doesn't mater as much but for the larger teams I would give it more importance.

Write things down if you have to, get involved with all the stats and options you can set your team up with.   I've probably completed about 3 full seasons all together at two different clubs, and I'm still very much a beginner. You have to invest the time to get the most out of the game, and I find playing in 3 or 4 hour sessions seem to be the best to get immersed and smash through a huge section.

footballmanagergames,3bv7ny,WelbzDoe,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:54:44 2015 UTC,"Best place to start for a new player is probably England, pick any team you like though for starting I recommend a team just below the top. Clubs like Spurs, Arsenal or Liverpool will have money available to spend, enough pulling power to get most any player in and you actually have a place to take them (the top) rather than starting at the top and having basically nowhere to go but down.   check the sub's sidebar for the fan sites, most of them will have tutorial sections for you to read. Also read everything the game throws at you in terms of tutorials or help.   Other than that... pff trial and error is the name of the game man.

Of course - Inter has not made world class signings but the names so far are not too shabby. Miranda, Kondogbia, possibly Martín Montoya and they are looking for Mario Suarez, Mohamed Salah and Stevan Jovetic if they can't land Salah. Apparently. Nothing official, just speculations about the wanted transfers. So I see Inter being a fun challenge for FM16. Hell even a database update on 15 would be decent."

footballmanagergames,3broeh,Rosstafan,14,Wed Jul 1 16:32:02 2015 UTC,"I had a similar one recently. Chicharito decided he wanted to leave so I promised to accept any offers that met my valuation (selling for value, I wasn't trying to keep him). I offer him out and get an offer from Sevilla, which I accept. A few days later I get a couple more offers, which I also accept. A week later, he still hasn't agreed on a contract with any of the teams, and he comes whining to me that I broke my promise. 2 days later he finally agrees to a contract with Sevilla and leaves. All I could do was shake my head at the stupidity."

The effect would be a classic head injury -> out for 3 months. At the moment I'm manager at Parma after they got relegated in 2020. I have some seriously idiotic players, who could need that button.  The first one is one of my midfielders who was injured for months. One week after the injury he wants to talk with me about his lack of appearances. Sadly there wasn't the option ""You fuckwit had your ankle broken, how am I supposed to play you?"".  The other one is my best DM. He was transfer listed by his own request (before I took over the club) and was unhappy because he was not sold. Nontheless, as he was my only good option there he played more often than not and after some months tells me that he wants to be removed from the transfer list.  Sounds good. Yeah no, a week later he comes to me and whines around about ""needing a new challenge"". That idiot changed his mind twice in a span of days."

The only players that earn really significant amounts of money outside of football, enough to make them play for a lower salary, are all too big for Liverpool barring a few players who happen to be stars of weaker national teams. Just saying. Why do you think players like Hulk, Witsel, Valbuena, etc. are all in Russia despite being good enough for any team in the premier league barring the title candidates."

The same can be said about the premier league. I mean, I'm not saying that you necessarily have to prefer to play in England. But for a lot of players, that's the case. Having a player be upset to not be given the opportunity to join Liverpool isn't unrealistic at all."

footballmanagergames,3brepf,krogars,3,Fri Jul 3 15:12:10 2015 UTC,"I've taken over Everton in 2024/25 (I think) and it's quite a mess. It's in £50 million in debt, has players on crazy wages and lacks homegrown players (both clubwise and nationwise) which impedes us both in the league and Champions League.  What should be the priority?   Wages (where I will get a tiny fee to reinvest with) Homegrown (where I won't get value for money and have little funds anyway) Selling loads to clear the debt (which may not allow me to reinvest properly)"
footballmanagergames,3brepf,SynchronizedHD3,6,Wed Jul 1 19:24:28 2015 UTC,"Winning pretty much fixes everything.  Don't overhaul things in your first season. Keep the core and try to qualify for Europa league at the very least, That should bring in some cash and give you more financial wiggle room next year.  As for the homegrown problem, I'm sure you have some HG players that are young and useful (Stones, Barkley). The other ones will have to be players from your youth team. They're not good enough to play but you need to have them registered anyways."
footballmanagergames,3brepf,peterwee999,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:32:33 2015 UTC,"Stones, Barkley   I think you missed the 24/25 season mark."
footballmanagergames,3brepf,krogars,3,Fri Jul 3 11:31:03 2015 UTC,"Try to mantain a strict budget control, that is the best thing you can do, and win games.    For example, the highest wage i will pay a player which i consider first team worthy is 180k/per week. If it is a key player i will pay him more, but its usually no more than 3 key players.  This allows me to be always saving money no matter what. So long term im making the economy of the club better.   Keep in mind that economy is not something that is going to change in 6 months, it changes in years.   Also, this wage restriction is of course relative, in my united save, first season i saw that Falcao was on a ridiculous wage, so i inmediately ended the loan, because it was a loss of money, doesnt matter if he wouldve scored 30 goals.    Buy young, sell old.   This is a basic concept that works at the highest levels, you buy young promising players and then sell them at prime age when they make you profit.   Keep the old players with excellent mental stats in order to tutor youth and/or contract them to your staff (i like to do this, makes me feel like im building a family in the club)   Try to get big pre season friendlies, so you get a bit of money from tickets. You always have the option of loans. If you are in a huge debt i think its number one priority to sort it out, if it means selling good players, and decreasing your chances of winning a title or something, then do it. It is better for the club. Try to win everything, i know its not easy, but u gotta work with whatever life gives you, and make something good of it. So yeah."
footballmanagergames,3brepf,peterwee999,2,Wed Jul 1 23:04:50 2015 UTC,"I just got Chelsea as a senior affiliate, yet they still want me to pay for loans? Am I missing something?"
footballmanagergames,3brepf,krogars,2,Wed Jul 1 16:09:13 2015 UTC,"Depends on if it's you who is instigating the loan, or if it's Chelsea themselves. If Chelsea offer you a player, I believe it's basically always 0% wages."

What's the best way to get my striker to start scoring more while not opening up things at the back? I've tried a defensive forward and a poacher with mixed results. Also, i've messed around with a 4-4-2 and a 4-1-3-2 and I do score, but I also usually get scored on as much as I do the scoring."
footballmanagergames,3brepf,Pippadoc,2,Thu Jul 2 16:40:04 2015 UTC,"With a lone striker, a lot of your success will come from how your midfielder's get forward to support him. You need to make sure you've got runners getting into the box as well, otherwise it'll be too easy to make your forward out of the game.  What role's are you using in your midfield and for your DR/DL? Maybe you can tweak those roles to give your striker more support."
footballmanagergames,3brepf,predsfan77,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:50:37 2015 UTC,"Fullbacks are playing limited defense. Wingers are 1 supporting and 1 attacking (in games where I cant keep possession I'll make them both supporting). DMC is Anchor. CMs are AP-Attack and Ball Winning- Support.  I usually play with retain possession and short passes as the only instructions. 90% of the time I'll be around or >55% possession and watching the games I seem to get the ball in the final 3rd most of the time, but usually end up turning it over before the final pass for a shot can be made."
footballmanagergames,3brepf,Pippadoc,2,Thu Jul 2 18:42:18 2015 UTC,"I'd look to get more from your fullbacks. I'd have a full-back support on the side with the winger attack, and a full-back attack on the side with the winger support. I'd also change ball-winning midfielder to a Box-to-Box midfielder. The box-to-box midfielder should contribute a little more going forward whilst also contributing a lot defensively.  That should help you get more players into the final 3rd which should give your players more options to pass to.  I'd also consider removing short passing. With retain possession your players will play safer, and so generally shorter passing. But you do want them to try some longer passes from time to time which should help break down teams."
footballmanagergames,3brepf,generic_online_name,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:10:54 2015 UTC,"Ok, Thanks! I'll give it a try. What about the striker? Defensive Forward, Poacher, or Advanced Forward? This is the lower league so most of these guys technical/mental skills are pretty rubbish."
footballmanagergames,3brepf,blazevxi,2,Thu Jul 2 19:26:10 2015 UTC,I'd go with Poacher or Advanced Forward depending on the attributes of your players. He should stay high up the pitch and force defenders to commit to covering him.   With two central midfielders potentially making runs forward you should be able to get him in one-on-one situations or even cause an overload in the centre of the pitch.
footballmanagergames,3brepf,DEP61,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:29:43 2015 UTC,"A lone striker in a lower-quality league, unless he's an incredible player, isn't very effective in my experience. 4-1-4-1 gives him no support, so I'd put someone else alongside him or use wingers."

footballmanagergames,3bt8ap,Stigface,2,Wed Jul 1 23:31:05 2015 UTC,"Ha!  Funny. I did have a save running for a short while managing Slutsk. I got them promoted in the first season but didn't continue it. I could go back and do that.  And yes, it was 'FC Gorodeya' that made me think of that."

footballmanagergames,3brzzs,danny1876j,2,Wed Jul 1 17:56:25 2015 UTC,"Your questions are completely subjective. Nobody here is able to view all the facts because it's your save.  You have to balance the loss of the player to your team in terms of ability and squad harmony against the potential fee received and the replacement quality.  You might sell a player for 60 million but unless you've a player lined up who can do a job then you might drop several places in the league next season (potentially) which could cost you millions.  Personally, I sign youngsters on permanent deals and I sign old players on loan to cover for youngsters I've sent out on loan. I don't sell players unless I've a youngster coming through who is good enough to do a job and is potentially better than him.  Using that system I don't have to ever ask that question, or, very very rarely.  TL:DR - Nobody knows because they're not in full possession of the facts.  Oh and I'm from Newcastle and obviously a NUFC fan so take care of my team."
footballmanagergames,3brzzs,ClandestineMovah,2,Wed Jul 1 18:10:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah I kind of lost where I wanted to go with the question whilst typing it out. Is it possible to force a player to stay? You say you don't sell, but I felt like I didn't have much of a choice, without upsetting the player. I'm also a Newcastle fan, so I'm trying to take care of them! Armstrong had a great season for a teenager. Have you had experience of kieran trippier? Seems like a good replacement for janmaat for a good price."
footballmanagergames,3brzzs,ClandestineMovah,2,Wed Jul 1 18:35:49 2015 UTC,"No, you've misunderstood my point. My point was not to say 'SELL!' or 'BUY!' but that it's difficult to comment because, well because of the reasons I've already given.  I'd respectfully ask you review my answer and pick my brains based off that.   Is it possible to force a player to stay?    I'm still on FM13. I felt no need to upgrade especially considering the fact the FM15 still has some bugs to iron out. I mention this because the A.I is exploitable in FM13. For example; in FM13 if a player want's to go but I don't want to sell him I can put him on the transfer list (without making any promises) and then price him out of the market (or) set him at such a price that if I did sell him it would mean the profit would offset the loss. Inevitably the player will come to me concerned that I've priced him out of a move and one of the conversational options will be to say something like 'I think you underestimate your value to the team' which I like because it does two things   I tells the player I want him to stay, he's wanted at the club. It shuts the player up, makes him happier and allows me to push for a much higher price with the only downside being that in the end I keep the player at the end of the transfer window and can take him off the transfer list until the next window open.   Janmaat is clearly a quality full back but if you could get 40m+ for him then you could surely find a better player than that. That's an over simplification. There are so many other variables to consider like his consistency, is he your captain (which he's not likely to be) or is he important at set-pieces. My point is you need to consider the players importance and not just sell him because he wants to.   Have you had experience of kieran trippier? Seems like a good replacement for janmaat for a good price.   I only know a little about him. A young Burnley full back. I don't know much about him in real life but he's quite highly rated in FM and likely more so in FM15.  I don't much care for conversations on specific players because I love a more random approach to FM in that I don't typically sign known players. I get a much bigger kick from my scouts coming back with a player I've never heard of who beasts the EPL."
footballmanagergames,3brzzs,jahartz,2,Wed Jul 1 19:24:18 2015 UTC,"Full/Wingbacks can be a bit difficult to replace early on because there aren't a lot of cheap, quality young players for that position starting out. I have had success retraining midfielders (DMs if they need to defend or Wingers if I want attacking) for the role, but it depends on your tactics and how much defensive responsibility you expect them to shoulder. A real life example would be Manchester United using Young and Valencia this season. They were good going forward but error-prone defending.  As the other guy said you have to weigh the fee you could receive vs. their performance vs. the quality of replacement. I have heard good things about Trippier if you can get him for a reasonable price. Another guy who seems to play well is Sam Byram at Leeds. You should also check out the teams that got relegated to see if you can get any cut-price deals for unhappy players.  As far as holding onto them, sometimes you can and sometimes you can't. If they want to leave because a specific team is interested then it is 50/50 for me. I usually promise them they can go if a bid matching my valuation comes in, then I set their asking price for 150-200% of their value. Half the time a bid comes in and I negotiate to my asking price and make the sale (Had to sell De Gea to Real like this, but I got $80 million so I coped). The other half of the time a bid never comes in and the player tells you they are happy to stay. You can take a harder line than this if you want, but you run the risk of not only pissing that player off, but pissing off the entire team."

footballmanagergames,3bqmyw,Karl_Faber,3,Wed Jul 1 10:43:52 2015 UTC,"Possibly because they are looking for 'realistic' transfers with regards to your budget and your club 'pulling power'. You want higher star player, maybe change the budget they're working with or leave it unspecified and up the potential star rating to about 4 stars.   Regardless, you're not very likely to get youngsters with 'sign at any price' a few years in, since potential wonderkids typically spawn with relatively low CA."
footballmanagergames,3bqmyw,Ikestar,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:05:26 2015 UTC,Thanks. I'm sure there are loads of hidden gems in Brazil available for good prices and they seem to be usually quite happy to come to Portugal due to the language and the lure of Europe etc.  Upping the star rating sounds like a good bet. I'm not too concerned about signing wonderkids because I need quality now rather than potential. I like to sign 23-24 year olds - guys who are already good and have plenty of years left.
footballmanagergames,3bqmyw,Ikestar,2,Wed Jul 1 11:12:29 2015 UTC,"Well upping the current ability level might be what you're looking for then. Regardless if you're in lower leagues it's a great opportunity to get in some good young talent with great potential. There's loads of it in South America and they usually aren't terrible to start with if you stick to 20-22 years of age. It's a better option than the 23-24 year olds since usually they're less 'established' players, meaning they're cheaper. Unless you go for the real wonderkids, you can usually get them in pretty cheaply."

footballmanagergames,3br9f4,Supalio,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:03:03 2015 UTC,I have had the same issues in FIFA Manager so that won't worry me too much.
footballmanagergames,3br9f4,Supalio,2,Wed Jul 1 15:15:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, there is a real in-depth gameplay of a manger and you have to pay attention to the details. However no personal life simulation, you can only choose which type of manager you want to be. Yes, it's quite easy to use and you can do pretty much anything with it. Each player has two hidden values : Current Ability (CA) and Potential Ability (PA) between 1 and 200 (Messi being something like 196). You can find them in the editor. In game, your scouts will give a 0 to 5 star rating to the players, depending on the level of your team (if you have shit team, any decent player will be 5 stars, and if you have a world class team, even Messi may only be 4.5 stars) and their ability to judge players. Depends on how much money you want to put into it and if you are OK to wait. You can find FM15 pretty cheap (around 15-20€). FM16 will be out around November for around 60€, with some new features but I doubt it will be game-changing."
footballmanagergames,3br9f4,iMurffy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:02:30 2015 UTC,I'm inclined to ask Where do you find FM15 that cheap?
footballmanagergames,3bqjb7,Boseth,4,Wed Jul 1 09:51:31 2015 UTC,"It depends on how much wait time your willing to deal with and how many divisions from those countries you wish to have loaded up.   I've currently got 11 countries loaded up, but pnly top divisions in each, apart from England where I have the top 2 divisions loaded. I'm using a relatively old spec laptop, with 2GB of RAM that's typically the bottle point of processing the game when I press continue, the CPU tends to run well below 100% but the RAM usage is usually around the 70/80% mark especially when I'm browsing the internet waiting for the game to continue.  Wait time's can be fairly lengthy on a Saturday when lots of games are played, but generally I don't find too bad."
footballmanagergames,3bqjb7,Pippadoc,2,Wed Jul 1 10:21:49 2015 UTC,"I run 12 countries with almost all leagues loaded within those countries.   My CPU is an i3-4130, and the game is installed on a Samsung Evo 850 SSD. I have 8GB RAM.  It runs pretty quickly considering I have all of those leagues running - even when I have FM on one monitor and I'm streaming football matches or TV on my second monitor. I have an AMD R9 280 graphics card but that won't make much difference to how FM performs. If I wanted it to load even quicker on heavy matchdays I'd have to get a better CPU, such as an i5-4440 or better.  Don't ask why I have so many leagues loaded...I guess I got over excited when I installed it onto my newly built PC and wanted to see what it could do."

I now have the game set to save 'Weekly'. Sure it slows progress in between games, but at the worst I now have 2 games to re-play.

footballmanagergames,3bodcx,TheJuventusFan,13,Tue Jun 30 20:55:45 2015 UTC,"I can't look into your game, but chances are Lichtsteiner is the designated throw-in taker for the team. Gets them tons of key passes and a high completion rate on key pass attempts. Also passes forward to wingers/wide midfielders (which is what fullbacks tend to do in most tactics) are often counted as forward key passes. Also, if he's played in a wingback-type role and picked up a few tackles, those are overvalued for the position also (in spite of being a defensive role wingbacks tend to have wide midfielder like evaluation sheets) and since he's not really in a position where he makes costly mistakes (in wingback systems, those usually get credited to CBs/DMs) this further inflates the rating.   Tl;dr - throw-ins are insanely overvalued and full/wingbacks are generally in a pretty great position to amass high ratings to begin with."

I'm the top team in England now and regularly challenging in Europe but am relying on poaching other team's youngsters at the moment.

My keeper plays SK, my sweeper plays libero. My DMs play one defensively, half-back or anchor man, and the other a DLP or Regista. They've got a box-to-box CM ahead of them. That's the core of most of my tactics, they but together a nice free-flowing game. Most successful with two full backs, two wingers, trequartista in AM and a lone poacher way up front.   Against bigger teams and in Europe I move the wingers back to midfield which seems to do the trick, playing more defensively."

He's running a lot and intercepting long passes while my defenders can continue marking the opposition forward, and using short passes towards the other midfileder to retain possession.  In a 4-3-3 I use one DM and two midfielders (one advanced playmaker and one complete midfielder), or sometimes use a regista and switching one midfielder to something more defensive (ball winning)"

footballmanagergames,3bnbwf,sanmon00,2,Tue Jun 30 16:30:34 2015 UTC,It's too bad but that's not how it works. But sometimes you get foreign players in via youth intake and I think the chance to get a Ghanese player is higher if you are connected to a club in Ghana.  I always try to have as much affiliated clubs as possible (preferably with a great youth academy etc.) but in 99% of the cases you have to sign the players from those clubs.

So yeah, he already is a good player in my book.  Depends on your tactic, and im sure you could sell him for a hefty amount later."

I literally couldn't flip Soldado or Paulinho ON A FREE."

I know it sucks cause you want to get guys off the books ASAP but if you play them / loan them out you can get good value for them later on.   I didn't get jack shit for Adebayor though. Loaned him out to 2 different clubs, and he simply was out of his depth.  Unreal decline for that guy. I didnt have a spot for him in my team anyway."
footballmanagergames,3blb3n,drenndak,6,Tue Jun 30 21:53:02 2015 UTC,Player value explodes once you win something.
footballmanagergames,3blb3n,Ikestar,6,Tue Jun 30 05:15:54 2015 UTC,"It's got nothing to do with FM15 specifically. It's simply how FM handles player value as their reputation rises. Not a perfect system and there's probably some ways to exploit it like you did, but generally it's a fairly decent system normally.   Besides, Chadli and Chiriches are pretty high-potential players in the database. Holtby and Stambouli vary wildly but are also pretty high up there. Kaboul/Soldado are high CA players with some years left in their prime in-game. not sure about Capoue/Fredricks/Fazio but I know they aren't bad players they all check in around the 140-150 CA range which is pretty good at game start. All things considered even without the rep boost from winning EPL/Europa League/FA Cup you should be able to net about 75 million pounds for the lot of them. Assuming the game doesn't screw you over and tells you nobody is interested in the players."
footballmanagergames,3blb3n,FJK_12,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:18:52 2015 UTC,"It's just going to be funny watching Bayern pay an assload to have Chadli sit on the bench.  Not to mention they managed to outbid me for Lacazette, they're going to pay him 115K/week to bench warm for Lewandowski.    I know it isn't FM15 specifically, it's been this way for ages.  Just a bit funny."

footballmanagergames,3bmbd2,Divolinon,3,Tue Jun 30 11:11:01 2015 UTC,I do the same. If the DoF isn't very good (or I don't have one) I let the head of youth dev do it. Works the same. Usually it ain't much but I've had him bring in some really good prospects from time to time as well.
footballmanagergames,3bmbd2,Ikestar,3,Tue Jun 30 11:44:17 2015 UTC,"I do this a lot. I let Director of football and Head of youth development make bids, but I decline them if they aren't what I want. However this just adds to it being about squad management."

footballmanagergames,3bmelw,Arctic_Turtle,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:46:20 2015 UTC,"If you like asymmetry, you should try playing with one AMR Winger and one WBL Complete Wingback, no others on the sides.   At least in FM2014 it has some interesting results, where the entire team seems to kind of rotate around the center point. When the left back advances then the right winger is more likely to drop back.  Over the course of a bit more than a season with this, I have more goals conceded from the right side, since I am missing a right back (I play with 2 CD and 1 SW/Libero) but on the other hand I am scoring more goals overall and I have a very high possession even against teams who should be stronger than me on paper."

The problem is he can't kick any goals. He has 19 finishing but just cannot kick a goal to save his life, always hitting the posts, the goalie, another player, or just missing altogether. On the few rare occasions he gets the ball in, it's offside. Without fail.  I can't see any problem with his stats, and he has a determined personality...so I just tell myself he has the worst luck ever, and next match he'll turn things around. But he never does.  Edit: my winger has more than 3x more goals than my striker, and has 13 finishing"
footballmanagergames,3bhumy,Perihelion_,5,Mon Jun 29 16:14:49 2015 UTC,How is your striker's composure? I had this problem with my regens who had 15+ finishing but bizarrely low composures so they couldn't finish well.
footballmanagergames,3bhumy,sarcastr0naut,2,Mon Jun 29 16:30:09 2015 UTC,"14 composure. His anticipation and concentration are quite low, maybe that's it?  Also his long shots really sucks but I taught him the PPM to avoid taking long shots"
footballmanagergames,3bhumy,braath1s,2,Mon Jun 29 18:34:36 2015 UTC,"That's probably a lot to do with it, especially considering you said he gets caught offside a lot. Try playing him in a deeper lying striker role rather than off the shoulder of the last man so that he's at less risk of being caught, or if he's young enough have him tutored by someone with half a braincell. I've had success with players even with poor long range shooting playing from deep as long as their finishing and on the ball skills are up to scratch and they can dribble, take it around defenders then finish from inside the box."

Got them promoted to Championship in my second season by winning League one, then had a dream run to the playoff final but lost (thankfully! We were nowhere near PL  level). Scored automatic promotion the next year.   This season just gone we came 15th decently avoiding relegation but being very inconsistent; lost twice to 20th placed Hull, yet decimating Arsenal 4-0. Looking to build my squad quite a bit this year. Team now is in 4-3-3 (will post screenshot later)  We have an awful record with cups! Lost the J-paint north final and have never been past the 4th round in the league cup or the FA cup. Sky bet league one is the only trophy i have won in the game, but I kinda love that its so competitive."

If you have enough money to transform the squad then do it, but don't play the tactic you want before until you reach a point where you can.  If your aim is simply to make a 5 defender formation I've often found the setting the middle centre-back to 'cover' stops him from leaving space to be exploited right in front of the goal. Look at the players preferred foot, I aim for a left footed player in the left slot and right footed on the right to facilitate clearances to the wings."

footballmanagergames,3bg0te,yoloswagmexican,12,Mon Jun 29 11:11:07 2015 UTC,I'll be following this with interest!
footballmanagergames,3bg0te,Stigface,9,Sun Jun 28 22:42:26 2015 UTC,"I cant help but consider how much time will be spent doing nothing. Even with all the content you are proposing, it's surely not possible that users will be buying new plots of land or selling up to encounter a new challenge every 10 minutes. What are we suppose to be doing in between the time where we are looking to improve our standing if we have no control over the match tactics etc. ?"
footballmanagergames,3bg0te,dath86,3,Mon Jun 29 00:36:35 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I read somewhere that there will be a 2D match engine. I was hoping this was going to be a faster timeline than watching every match? I'd want to be able to fast-forward through months at a time to see the influence of each decision."
footballmanagergames,3bg0te,philliesphan0203,5,Mon Jun 29 01:22:10 2015 UTC,"Good points from the two of you. It's a concern certainly for me and something I think a lot about. Firstly I think the concept for this game really works for multiplayer, it adds a dimension to the transfer market, ownerships etc. The downside is what you guys are pointing out.   I'm hoping the micro management aspects of the game give players something to do. I don't know if you guys have ever played Trevor Chan's Capitalism II? It's possible to create an HQ and staff it with people to take care of the micro management involved in the game. Otherwise if you're inclined, you can do things like setting pricing strategy, setting up factories etc. I wanted to implement something like that so that the casual players can flit in/out of the game and the ones that were more invested could use that to their advantage to get further in the game faster.  Naturally it's not going to be possible to own Real Madrid, Chelsea, Man Utd etc at the start of the game so if you can optimize your buy low / sell high strategy with smaller clubs by focusing on the details, you should be able to buy those bigger clubs sooner."
footballmanagergames,3bg0te,cookie1254,3,Mon Jun 29 01:50:49 2015 UTC,"@Stigface Once the game is eventually launched, part of my monetization strategy is allowing people to create private game worlds (maybe for a small monthly subscription?). With your own private world - you could run the game at whatever speed you wanted."

footballmanagergames,3bg0te,delqhic,2,Mon Jun 29 17:02:59 2015 UTC,"I really like the concept of the game, i´ve signed up for the beta  and i'm really excited to play it. But In modern day football the clubs with the most money are dominating the european football theaters, its not a fair game anymore. So my main concern is how are the economics going to be balanced out in the game ? You have clubs like Fc basel, who have an excellent scouting or Ajax with their world class youth academic and that way can compete a little bit with the big clubs. So basicly my point is money should not be the main factor to succes, but the way you manage your club should.  It would be awesome to have a owner or managing director with a set off skills that will give you an advantage in the way you run the club. For instance if i like to develop talent and sell them for a high price like Ajax does my character should have that skill set to give my youth academy an advantage to develop the next star.   If think something like this would be beneficial to create a level playing field were anything is possible and not every season the same clubs play in the champions leaque knock out rounds. Just because they can spend and pay a lot more money."
footballmanagergames,3bg0te,Irishane,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:19:34 2015 UTC,"Well the way I see it, even with a blank cheque-book you can only field 11 players on the pitch so there's plenty of opportunity for canny / shrewd business strategies to compete with the Money Bags FCs!  As you can imagine, the balancing of the game is something I'll be doing later on in the development process but you've nailed most of my thoughts. Feel free to reach out via Twitter/Email, it would be nice to hear some of your other thoughts ;)"

footballmanagergames,3bg0te,tyler3794,2,Mon Jun 29 11:24:31 2015 UTC,"Section 1. Terminology of article  Union Jack:       The terms Union Jack and Union Flag are both historically correct for describing the de facto national flag of the United Kingdom. Whether the term Union Jack applies only when used as a jack flag on a ship is a modern matter of debate.   According to the Parliament of the United Kingdom:   ""Until the early 17th century England and Scotland were two entirely independent kingdoms. This changed dramatically in 1603 on the death of Elizabeth I of England. Because the Queen died unmarried and childless, the English crown passed to the next available heir, her cousin James VI, King of Scotland. England and Scotland now shared the same monarch under what was known as a union of the crowns.  In 1606 he (James VI) gave orders for a British flag to be created which bore the combined crosses of St. George and of St. Andrew. The result was the Union Jack, Jack being a shortening of Jacobus, the Latin version of James"".

footballmanagergames,3bk1bf,GfxJG,2,Mon Jun 29 21:19:29 2015 UTC,dribbling and crossing looks a little low for winger.
footballmanagergames,3bk1bf,WARGLBARGL,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:54:37 2015 UTC,"And his vision too low to be an advanced playmaker of much merit.

footballmanagergames,3bk1bf,spurs-r-us,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:29:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah... And I believe things like Dribbling and Crossing are easier to train than Vision, no? I think I'll have him be a winger, as said, I have enough talent for midfield."

footballmanagergames,3bk1bf,SirArchieCartwheeler,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:38:11 2015 UTC,"From the wing his lack of crossing ability will hinder the number of good chances you get. He could work as an inside forward or a ramdeuter, but that would mean limiting the number of chances created.  Having said that, he's young. If you focus training on crossing/dribbling he'll be able to develop those attributes to an acceptable standard."

footballmanagergames,3bjyiu,Seungjin95,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:58:25 2015 UTC,Lots of coaches. good fitness coaches. tactics suitable for your players. tactics suitable for the weather conditions. appropriate training levels. sign non-injury prone players. make sure your pitch condition is good. rotate players.  give players rest when needed(click extended leaves at the top of the squad screen to see who needs it). train fitness during periods where you don't have any matches(pre-season and winter breaks).   They're all things I do and have very little issues with injuries.

footballmanagergames,3bjyiu,djipaloz,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:30:20 2015 UTC,Could you please tell me more about weather conditions and tactics?
footballmanagergames,3bjyiu,StupidMastiff,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:25:41 2015 UTC,"Quick short passing is less likely to be effective in poor weather conditions like rain and snow because the ball won't move as fast along the ground, using high tempo and closing down more in wet or frosty conditions means that players are more likely to lose their footing which can result in injuries(I'm not 100% sure this is the case, but it seems logical to me).  Using instructions like close down more and get stuck in with players who have low bravery and/or tackling means they are more likely to come out of 50/50 challenges worse off. High tempo and closing down more with players who have low stamina means they tire faster, and the lower condition they have means more injuries."

footballmanagergames,3bfm3x,jahartz,27,Sun Jun 28 20:09:12 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure height has no bearing on the game besides how much jump reach a player starts out with. You should be happy with his 9 jump reach, considering his height. You can also train Jump Reach and see if it will increase a few points or not.  I would use this player at the DM position as a DLP, a regista, or a BWM.  He would also be amazing if you have him man-mark the opposing team's playmaker.  I have a player similar to yours and he can completely neutralize the opposing team's playmaker, forcing them to pass backwards and sideways for a whole game.  You can also just throw him at RB. He is already world class at the position and he will slot right in seamlessly and wreak havoc."
footballmanagergames,3bfm3x,celestial1,7,Sun Jun 28 20:47:01 2015 UTC,"""Jumping Reach reflects how good a player is at reaching the ball in the air. It indicates the highest point an outfield player can reach with his head. It is not necessarily reflective of how tall a player is, but when considering his jumping ability, it makes sense to take into account the player’s height. For example, a player of 200+cm will still possess a high reach even if he is a poor jumper, and a player who measures in at 170cm will struggle to compete at the same height due to the 30cm difference in height between the two.""   Source"
footballmanagergames,3bfm3x,FaceStealer,3,Sun Jun 28 21:10:29 2015 UTC,That is kinda what I have been thinking too. I signed Javi Martinez as my holding midfielder because I like having a taller player there to win air clearances since I tend to peg back the opposition a lot. I think I could use this guy and just use someone else if the opponent uses a target man. I am developing Ajer as well so the two guys could split time in the future I think.  I was thinking he might be my Right Back for the future since Rafael is angling for a move to Real Madrid but the height thing worried me. I guess it won't hurt to try in cup games and see what happens.  Man marking a playmaker out of the game is something I hadn't considered. That could really be useful. Thanks.

footballmanagergames,3bfm3x,joethesaint,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:36:47 2015 UTC,"I personally would love to deploy this guy next to a DLP as a BWM in a two DM formation, but he can still be used as a playmaker.

footballmanagergames,3bfm3x,JimmyRust,2,Sun Jun 28 21:10:24 2015 UTC,"Right back. Having really good fullbacks is important in all the systems I play with and they're often my best players in general. It depends on the system that you use (and I also don't know about height's effect on the game) but he could be a great midfielder since I find heading to be very important in the middle of the park. I still think he'd be best at full back for you if you use any attacking system though, I love running a 4-4-2 diamond with excellent fullbacks for width."

Well today, after another three years game-time, I've done something I never thought I'd ever be able to achieve in any FM series. I've became the Greatest Manager of All Time worldwide.  From showing up in Indonesia with little to no playing squad but a bunch of well, amateurs, to managing arguably the greatest football side ever after two consecutive UEFA Champions League wins, simultaneously completing an incredible sextuple, along with a Copa America win with Brazil - just an absolute dream FM game. My friends have been nattering on at me for months now with ""Why are you still playing 14? Open 15!"". Yet it still sits in the wrapper. Because this game was special, and I was not walking away from it.  Life can be shitty. FM is an escape of epic proportions, of that I'm sure we all know. Thank you, SI. I love this game.  Total List of Honours    Africa with Dynamos FC - 1 CAF Champions League; 2 ABSA Premiership Titles; 1 CAF Super Cup; 1 Nedbank Cup; 1 Telkom Knockout Cup; 1 MTN-8 Cup  North America with Deportivo Toluca - 2 LigaMX Titles; 1 CONCACAF Champions League  Asia with Jeju United - 1 AFC Champions League; 3 K-League Classic Titles; Two KFA Cup Wins  South America with Grêmio FBPA - 1 Copa Libertadores; 1 FIFA Club World Cup; 1 Campeonato Brasileirão Title; 1 Copa do Brasil  Europe with FC Bayern München - 3 UEFA Champions Leagues; 8 Bundesliga Titles; 2 FIFA Club World Cups; 2 UEFA Super Cups; 6 DFB-Pokals; 6 DFL-Super Cups  International Competitions with Brazil U23s, Italy U23s, and Brazil - 1 Olympic Silver Medal (Brazil U23s); 1 Gold Olympic Medal (Italy U23s); 1 Copa America (Brazil)"

I was watching the WWC England-Canada game and thought that playing with AMCs would be enhanced if the midfield dropped deeper to come get the ball, then we could play possession (which was a philosophy they wanted me to play). The mids are both set to defense (DLP and BWM) so I thought they'd fall into a semi-DM role on the defense, then they can get it up to the Enganche who can start the attack.  It's not netted any real results so far, but then again I'm not the best manager. Yet."

The season before I was forced to sell England international Adam Forshaw to Man City for £20 million, because of his minimum fee release clause - but Lewis Baker stepped in marvellously.  The XI of the season was as follows...  L. Nicholls; J. Tavernier, R. Kiernan, G. Hanley (£3.7M - Blackburn), G. Buckle (Regen: £375k - Leyton Orient); C. McManaman, L. Baker (£15M - Chelsea), E. Huws, D. Alli (£2.2M - MK Dons), D. Mitchell (Loan - Man Utd); S. Berahino (£5M p/ex - West Brom)  Was delighted to do it so quickly, and was especially happy to do it with keeping so many of the original players together. We also had the second lowest wage budget in the league. I shall be continuing with a vicious focus on youth - left back Gary Buckle is the only one of the many young kids I signed to become a first team regular as of yet, but I have noticed the youth team has slowly been bringing in better and better players naturally - I think the end goal is to be completely reliant on players from the academy, but I'm not sure how viable this will be in practice."

My main goal is to eclipse PSV because they're city rivals, things have been going great and I recently got PSG as a parent club so I'm looking forward to see what will come of that.  I've already got a Japanese midfielder regen on loan as well as Hervin Ongenda, I'm hoping we can push on again this year because both players will go in to the first team.  I don't want to turn in to a Vitesse like club relying on loans all the time but until I grow enough to attract players that's going to have to do.  I've managed to secure a stadium explanation from 4700 to 7000 and I'm hoping to improve the facilities as time goes by.  My financial situation isn't great, by the end of the season last year we were in the red and relied on our good finish in the Eredevisie to balance the books.  I'm really enjoying the Dutch league, apart from PSV, Ajax and Feyenoord I fancy my chances against anyone in the league so it's always entertaining.  I couldn't recommend the Dutch leagues more, if you're looking for a good save find a team that interest you and have a go, you've got nothing to lose!

I just picked the relatively small team from my hometown and got to know all the players and create some tactics around that. (I had a very good CM and AM, so I opted for a narrow, passing tactic that made then the focal point of the team) As the pace of the game is quite slow you really get a feel for how the team plays and how the players evolve and you start to climb the ranks by identifying and signing the right reinforcements and adapting my tactics as my team changes.   My tips for you would be to pick a small team, get to know it, try to progress. The feeling of accomplishment when things work out  is strangely addictive.  Also try to watch some lets plays of lower league management (LLM) and pick up some tips."

footballmanagergames,3bfazq,jaschac,2,Mon Jun 29 17:30:38 2015 UTC,"There seem to be two schools of thought around here: (1) what /u/Pargelenis (and myself) liked: go to small team in a lower league. You'll have fewer resources available, but you'll also have fewer resources to manage and much lower expectations. Or (2) Go big. Pick one of the world super-teams. They're will be demands put upon you by the board of directors, but you'll also have (effectively) limitless resources and a pool of players that should make even bad tactics work.    Either way, pick a team and then don't worry about performance. Just spend that first how-ever-many-months-you-play getting used to the interface, and figuring out how the game is played. Once you've gotten your feet wet and don't feel quite so overwhelmed by the game (and it is overwhelming at first), then you can go back, pick your ""real"" team and make a real go of it."

However, I don't think I'll be able to improve the league that much as I don't get any places in the North American Champions League."
footballmanagergames,3bcc0u,Quinn155,4,Sun Jun 28 10:14:21 2015 UTC,"So is there no competitions you can enter outside of Bermuda itself? Seems a bit unfair because it makes it effectively impossible to increase the countries co-efficient.     I suppose you could always try taking over the National Team and seeing if you can do anything with it, although seems very tedious if you can't improve the league."
footballmanagergames,3bcc0u,Cogito96,5,Sun Jun 28 12:05:17 2015 UTC,"North America doesn't appear to have coefficient, it seems all locked in place. I did a bit of research and I think I might be able to qualify if I have some success with the national team. The system seems a bit confusing, but I think if the national team comes 1st, 2nd or 3rd on the Caribbean Championship, then the league will get 1 NA CL spot for the next 2 seasons."
footballmanagergames,3bcc0u,Cogito96,3,Sun Jun 28 12:40:55 2015 UTC,"Hmm, interesting. Maybe if you improve the league, you'll raise its rep enough to warrant a CL place for the league winner?"
footballmanagergames,3bcc0u,Cogito96,2,Sun Jun 28 12:22:59 2015 UTC,"After doing some research, it appears that if the national team makes the final or wins the 3rd place play-off in the Caribbean Championship, then the league will be given 1 CL spot for the next 2 seasons."

footballmanagergames,3bfss5,quillana,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:03:52 2015 UTC,"I don't want to be that guy but I think the major fault you do is having him as a striker. Even though he is (?) natural on the striker position, I would never in my life use him up front. Mostly because of whenever I have bought him I will solely use him as my central attacking midfielder because imo that's where he shines like an ocean of diamonds. If you still are keen on making him grab goals I'd recommend you work out a tactic where you can use him as a Shadow Striker. But usually I have him as an AM with attack duty or AP with support duty and both of them have worked absolute wonders.   Of course you are entitled to use him as a striker. My personal preference is to use him as a CAM.   If you still want him to be used as a striker I'd say work his composure up, and if you're not already - use him as a poacher with a DLF or TM next to him in a 2-striker system. If you run a 1-striker system try using him as a trequartista and see how that works out.   Good luck, I'm sorry to see that he has those stats and is not playing accordingly."
footballmanagergames,3bfss5,Wallygoblin,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:18:30 2015 UTC,I think you may be right about it not being his best position however currently im having an injury crisis and he has been called upon.  I do think he has the stats to perform the role better than he is doing and even when I have played him as CAM i dont feel ive had much of a return!  Saying this my last game before bed last night he did smash in a 20 minute hat trick after I lost my shit with him at half time. Maybe he just needs some gentle encouragement

Up top I use two strikers, both who have more direct passes turned on, and regularly get 15+ assists a year.  He does seem to be prone to poor runs of form, but the moment I lose it with him, he tends to show what he's capable of."

footballmanagergames,3bepsf,Chuta_pa_canto,4,Sun Jun 28 16:05:06 2015 UTC,"Being closed down by opponent's strikers might force the goalie to use his weaker foot instead of dominant one, as he won't have enough time to control the ball to kick it with his preferred foot.  But yeah I don't understand either, why the assistants all want goalkeepers to stop using their weaker foot. So would love to get an answer to that as well."
footballmanagergames,3bepsf,jerkesto,3,Sun Jun 28 16:03:42 2015 UTC,Why can't they practise using the outside of the foot?
footballmanagergames,3bepsf,jerkesto,3,Sun Jun 28 17:37:11 2015 UTC,"Well I guess learning to use the outside of the foot effectively is quite difficult to do, also not best thing to have your goalkeeper do, when under pressure.

Unfortunately, the strategy was nerfed in one of the last few patches. It used to be that you would get a foreign player coming through the college system  once in a while. These players (many came from S.A., and some from Europe) would have a higher CA/PA because of their nationalities, but would still be amateurs, and thus available for free transfer to other nations. In the latest patches however the chances of foreign players seems lower and when you do get one there ca/pa seems to be lower in general. This leaves the american players, whom the AI seems to be doing a pretty good job of picking up. Perhaps SI have some system set up to mimic foreign teams swooping in."

If you don't mind me asking, who are you playing? what squad status did you offer? Where did he end up going? What squad status does he have now?   I'm thinking it could be club rep not rising or dropping fast enough influencing the player.

footballmanagergames,3bafcu,8u11etpr00f,25,Sat Jun 27 12:09:10 2015 UTC,"The clubs do it because the board demands the managers sign high profile players. What needs to get fixed isn't the fact that these teams act this way, what they should improve is the AI's ability to manage squad sizes better. There's nothing inherently wrong with teams like Real Madrid, PSG, or Man City to purchase high-profile players every season, but there needs to be an equal outflow of players on the other end, right now that outflow is lacking, thus creating oversized squads."

I told him he was ""amazing in front of goal"", and he got pissed off at me because he didn't think he was that great, presumably because he only scored once and missed a bunch of times."
footballmanagergames,3bafcu,immerc,13,Sat Jun 27 12:16:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think they need to give more options, including some better generic ones. Have the same ones as now if they did score lots or finish well, but have it so that you can just say ""you played very well in the last game"" or ""your contribution was key"" or something like that.    I also have always thought there needed to be more variations in team talk options at all stages of the game."
footballmanagergames,3bafcu,miomike,8,Sat Jun 27 15:18:36 2015 UTC,"I think the goal of the various choices in interactions is to let you pick the appropriate one, so if a striker gets a lot of assists you don't praise them for their goal scoring, so they shouldn't focus too much on the generic ones.  The praise right now is the various categories of praise for that positions, so strikers get pass / goals, defenders get defence / pass.  The problem is that sometimes defenders did well because they happened to get some set play goals.  You need to have the option to praise the thing that the player actually did well, even if hidden among other irrelevant things."
footballmanagergames,3bafcu,immerc,5,Sat Jun 27 15:50:08 2015 UTC,"I agree, I actually consider it a massive backwards step in the series actually as they seemed to be moving in the right direction with it. They've given the team and players more opportunities to get pissed off but less options to deal with them. Immensely frustrating."
footballmanagergames,3bafcu,bluebird2912,91,Sat Jun 27 16:59:20 2015 UTC,Either increased the variety in press conferences or just get rid of them. At this point they just piss everyone off because the answers barely do anything.

Instead, the game acts as if losing it would be absolutely devastating for your season."

footballmanagergames,3bafcu,saint-simon97,7,Sun Jun 28 00:45:04 2015 UTC,"I just thought of one thing they could do to spice it up.  You know how all the players have ""media handling style"" listed?  Also, you know how in real world press conferences the manager is often joined by a player for the pre-match press conference?  Give you the option to bring a player to the press conference and have the media request certain players.  It could be interesting to see what happens when your player calls the opposing manager a talentless dolt and the media asks you to respond, or if you're in a bad run your player might criticize your ideas in front of the press.  That would at least make them a little less repetitive."

You don't get to sign players, you're given unfit first-teamers who need match time to get back to full fitness, your best players are called up to the main team right when you're starting to rely on them, and you might be forced to play with first-team tactics even if you don't really have the players for it.  IMO it could be a lot of fun and could give you an excuse to start as an unknown manager but at your favourite high-profile team then work your way up to being the main team manager after a few seasons."
footballmanagergames,3bafcu,immerc,50,Sat Jun 27 11:05:53 2015 UTC,"Tweeted miles about this, he says it will never happen, no media no transfers etc. He said it would be boring. I would love it"
footballmanagergames,3bafcu,juicewilson,39,Sat Jun 27 12:38:30 2015 UTC,"I would love it too, not as a long-term thing, but as a way to start your career as a manager.  What I'd love about it is that it would give you an excuse to put your manager into your favourite club without kicking out your current manager.  I prefer to play as a manager without long history so I can build up my legend, but that means I either have to start in the lower leagues, or start at my favourite club and have all the players show me no respect.  I think Miles is nuts because the media interactions are boring to begin with, so missing out on them would be no big deal.  No transfers might be a bit boring, but you could make up for that by allowing the U21-manager (player) to scout players in his free time and make recommendations to the main manager.  In any case, I think the different kind of challenge (get players back to full fitness / back in form, deal with your best players being called up to the first team, etc.) would more than make up for missing out on some other things."
footballmanagergames,3bafcu,immerc,8,Sat Jun 27 12:54:43 2015 UTC,"Scouting for the first team would be so fun, you see a request from the manager to report on some players and you go in and look at all their stats and attributes, maybe even watch a game of theirs and report on their performance then give a star report and select the options like ""good league 1 player"" ""world class player"" etc."

footballmanagergames,3bafcu,outroversion,12,Sat Jun 27 16:53:00 2015 UTC,I totally agree - maybe if a player isn't doing well in the first team or needs match fitness the main manager could set you a target: 'Get him fit in time for the derby next week' or something.
footballmanagergames,3bafcu,Kemps,20,Sat Jun 27 11:28:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and you're not necessarily just judged on how the reserve team does at the end of the season, but also on how many reserve players make their way into the first team, and how happy the main manager is at how quickly you've got their out of form / injured players back to their best."

footballmanagergames,3bafcu,Ipeland,9,Sat Jun 27 15:36:05 2015 UTC,"I agree. I also wish they took into account how many times you played your rival in the past 5 years when they look at rivalries. I played a rival once in a preseason friendly? probably not a rivalry. I met a team in 2 cup finals and twice during the seasons with a late penalty or a key player thrown off, maybe the start of a rivalry."

They let me loan a load of their young players, who are... League 2 quality, but awesome for the Conference. More rivalries like this, instead of the whole 'WE MUST WIN OR DEATH' attitude would be nice.   'Cause it happens IRL in cities with lower level teams and bigger teams. E.g. where I live, United and Wednesday do a lot of stuff to support Sheffield FC and Hallam FC (the two oldest football teams in the world, just sayin'). So whilst it'd be a 'rivalry', because I'm sure Sheffield'd love to beat us, it's not like Man United/City, y'know."

footballmanagergames,3bafcu,BackpackingScot,22,Sat Jun 27 12:02:00 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of academy philosophies.  It isn't just that La Masia produces better quality players, they also produce a certain type of player."
footballmanagergames,3bafcu,immerc,15,Sat Jun 27 12:41:33 2015 UTC,"I like that too.  Every year I get one or two world class players come through my academy (by year, I mean actual real year because I only ever play as Boro through one save) and in my save there is a distinct lack of world class centre halfs.  I'd love to produce one myself, even better if it's an English one, as my defence is shocking.    I don't think it'd be too hard to do either.  You could set the random factor to be more likely to give you better players in where you're looking for.  It doesn't have to be every year you get a world class player, but maybe tweak it so most years you'll end up producing the type of player you want, and it's more likely the best player being produced that season will be in the role/position you want, but obviously some years your best player will just be in another position.  I think it'd be a good change."

footballmanagergames,3bafcu,randymarsh3169,14,Sat Jun 27 15:22:19 2015 UTC,Biggest pet peeve. Or when you sign a 17 year old with decent potential but no where near your first 11. Still play him off the bench though. and he comes to you saying he needs more time. Nope not going to happen. I'll bring you off the bench.
footballmanagergames,3bafcu,vette91,79,Sat Jun 27 16:16:37 2015 UTC,"Young players should be able to play a variety of positions, and ability to play certain positions should fade away if left unused. So a youngster could play anywhere from the central midfield to the attacking midfield (I want'em all 'accomplished' with one 'natural' position on the axis or flank) but if you then choose to only play him as say, an AMC, his ability to play winger as a position should start to fade. Fuck press conferences. Either make them less commonplace and more varied or get rid of them altogether. Right now they're just a hassle to deal with.  Explain shit better. You know you're doing a shitty job explaining your game mechnics to users if people who've played your game for years can still learn new, fairly basic mechanics four or five years into playing the game. That's not a compliment to the complexity of your game, that's a sign you're not telling your users what the hell is going on.  Pet peeve, but player ratings need some adjusting. I have a LB who has 18 long throw and the 'uses long flat bullet passes' trait. That little shit has been averaging rating averages of about 8.6 per season for the last five years because those types of throwins somehow get counted as key passes. No joke, he had about 900 key passes in a season once. Also, why does the guy who gets taken down for a penalty get an assist credit for the penalty goal?  Some sort of expansion of the regen system. I like youth intakes, but it's too much of a crapshoot and considering how heavily the game relies on regens it kinda sucks that if you want a good team a few seasons in it's nearly impossible to not rely mostly on foreign players.  Club reputation growth needs to either be accelerated or specific achievements should bump it up significantly. Right now if you're building a team getting in top talent can be really hard because the reputation of the club doesn't go up quickly enough. Player reputation needs to fluctuate both ways, quickly. There is no fucking way a player whose contract has expired over a season ago to still have significant wage demands. That dude should be chomping at the bit to sign a short-term deal. I want the ability to take on players who have languished in free agency for a season for a bottom price, maybe even a six-month deal for next to no money. If they perform, they can THEN negotiate a new contract.  Speaking of player contracts, why am I able to placate a player who is on a relatively cheap deal but who has world class ability by telling him he's got a lot of time left on his contract? There's no way a player would accept something like that. Players should ask or even demand a clause that says if they reach a certain level of fame, production or ability the manager is REQUIRED to re-open contract negotiations.  Make sure player media reactions line up with player actions. If a player responds positively to me telling the media ""I want him on my team"" and I finally get an offer for him accepted, what I don't want is to see the player refuse to talk to me.  Player promises is a cool idea, but it should be clear what the promise IS, when you're making a promise to a player and the player should be at the very least reasonable about what can be done to fulfill a promise.  No player unless completely terrible should ever have no offers. No offers is crazy town. If I put a decent player on the list, at the very list I want some lower reputation teams trying to lowball me into selling him. I'll take a shitty deal on occasion to get rid of a player. But nothing annoys me more than having a bunch of old nagging dudes on my team who I cannot get rid of because nobody wants them, even though they're still plenty good to play in lower leagues."
footballmanagergames,3bafcu,Ikestar,16,Sat Jun 27 13:46:10 2015 UTC,"Just as a side note to one of your points, (I agree with all of it really) but the penalty assist thing is what actually happens I think (depending on who is doing the statistics, but most do include penalty assist). They see it as the player that won the penalty ""created"" the goal scoring opportunity for the penalty taker - unless they are one and the same I think. Sometimes it is just considered the assist as opposed to granted as one in real matches though."
footballmanagergames,3bafcu,miomike,10,Sat Jun 27 15:33:15 2015 UTC,"With regards to ability to play positions fading away, I think it should only fade away to a certain level. So if he was once a natural, he'll eventually forget how to be natural but he'll always be at least accomplished. If he was once competent, he will always be at least unconvincing, and so on.  With regards to player promises there is at least now a tab to keep track of the promises you've made, whether you've fulfilled them, and how much longer you have until they expire."
footballmanagergames,3bafcu,DaWolf85,9,Sat Jun 27 15:57:35 2015 UTC,"re: the last point. HELL FUCKING YES. Even when I set a player's price to zero and I was playing in the Russian Premier League, you would have thought poor little Shinnik would take him, surely? Even worse when I eventually just get rid of the bugger and Shinnik THEN decide they want him.   Also, the ratings. Man. I feel really freaking bad for a player when his rating sinks through the floor because he made one mistake that lead to a goal, but he's been brilliant the rest of the game. I'd like more accurate keeper ratings, too, as it seems like sometimes a keeper does nothing in a game, but the team wins 4-0, so they get a good rating, but maybe the keeper's been a hero against a much better team, and we've lost, and the rating's been lame.   I'd also like keepers' eccentricity score to DO something wacky. I want stories of them punching defenders in the head, or making their own kits, or playing in their bare hands for penalties..."

Different personality types?  If these kinds of things are going to be in the game, at least make it more clear when there might be personality issues.  Also, prevent a very determined younger player's determination from decreasing if they're tutored by a low-determination tutor.  This makes low-determination superstars (Ozil) useless as tutors."

footballmanagergames,3bafcu,thumbthrower,22,Sat Jun 27 15:55:58 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see FM16 embrace the idea of 'crazy' owners. This could be done by greying out certain staff responsibilities - ie the Chairman is the only person that can hire/fire a Director of Football and then it forces the DoF take on certain roles, such as making bids for players for the first team.  It could extend into the club philosophies - a new owner could take over a club and they could demand their own philosophies onto the club and manager, potentially blocking transfers if they didn't match a particular philosophy.  I think it would go further into making each job a different experience, and give the player another factor to consider before accepting/applying for new jobs."
footballmanagergames,3bafcu,JoelB83,7,Sat Jun 27 12:57:36 2015 UTC,"And on the other hand, have fan owned clubs work differently like fc united and st Pauli.

footballmanagergames,3bafcu,chickentrousers,21,Sat Jun 27 14:14:16 2015 UTC,"Discovering a player's best position improves (unmasks) their potential ability.  For example, you have a pretty good winger but his potential is only 2 stars.  You think he'd make a better FB, so you retrain him as a FB, now his potential climbs to 3 stars.  AFAIK if someone isn't marked as a natural and you retrain him now, his potential only drops, even if it's clear from his stats he'd be better at another role.  Examples: Bale is a mediocre fullback, you decide to play him as a winger, suddenly his potential is world class, and you get the credit for figuring out the his best position.  Thierry Henry is a good winger but you see him as a striker...  Fellaini is a pretty good DM but his attacking skills are wasted..."
footballmanagergames,3bafcu,immerc,10,Sat Jun 27 11:26:05 2015 UTC,"Isn't this already more or less the case? I mean, right now if you have a LB with good attacking skills but with so-so defensive skills, he'll have maybe a 2 star rating as an LB, so you retrain him to winger, stick him in winger and his ABILITY (not his potential, that'd be silly since it quantifies natural talent ceilings rather than specific ability) rises to 3 stars because his skills are better suited for his new role. Over time the player becomes natural and his talent (which should remain the same) is put into winger stats (since you're training him and playing him in that position).   So, what you're describing is already an existing feature of the game."
footballmanagergames,3bafcu,Ikestar,4,Sat Jun 27 13:25:14 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm wrong, but it seems like what I want is different from what's in the current game.  Right now if you look at a young player you'll see their current ability in their current position along with their (coach assessed) potential ability in that position.  If you look at their potential ability in other positions (using the squad depth chart) it's always lower than their potential ability in their currently ""natural"" positions.  What I'd like to see is it for their potential ability in other positions to be fairly unknown, and if you figure out the best position for a player, the coaches start re-assessing their ideas of the player's potential ability in that new spot, and for that potential ability rating (number of stars) to be higher than it was in their old position.  For example, you have Bale as a young left back and he's rated 2 stars, with a potential of maybe 3 stars as a left back.  His left wing rating is currently 1 star (because he never plays there) and his potential is listed as 1 star (with maybe 2 black stars because the other coaches might have some idea he could do well there too).  You retrain Bale as a winger and play him there.  After a short while, his current ability goes up as he becomes more used to playing that position and is better able to use his abilities there, and the coaches realise he has amazing potential there, so his potential ability as a left winger goes to 3.5 stars with 1.5 stars of black boxes.  Right now, it seems like retraining the player to play another position costs some of their potential ability rather than unlocking their full potential by finding the right position for them."
footballmanagergames,3bafcu,immerc,2,Sat Jun 27 13:47:33 2015 UTC,"I can see the confusion, but you're not interpreting the game correctly IMO.   Ability and potential are tied to two numbers, the CA and the PA. Both are fixed entities and are used to determine how many 'ability points' the player can amass total. What's important to note is that different 'ability points' have a different weight against the CA-PA numbers. For instance, tackling has very low value for an AMC (.5 CA points per ability point), while something like passing has a high value (2 CA points per ability point). This is fairly straightforward and intiutively done for each position with each stat. Some stats, namely determination, flair, and natural fitness have no impact on CA or PA. These can be either very low or very high with no consequence.   What happens when you're switching a player's position (or rather, adding a position to his register) is that you're chaning the way the game calculates his CA point allocation in terms of his ability points. I've not played around with this (I might at some point) but in theory, it should mean that you could take a natural LB with decent attackign stats, retrain him into a winger and with training and playtime transform him into an absolute monster since his natural CA calculation still assumes he's a LB first and a LW second. Again, haven't messed around with this yet so I can't be sure.  So, a player like Bale for instance, in game terms, was a 'natural' LWB with a high PA and relatively low fullback CA due to having a lot of his ability points allocated into what the game interprets to be 'garbage' point categories for the role, such as technical ability, creativity, passing, technique, dribbling, vision, etc. Stats that are valuable for wingers, but less so for fullbacks. Thus moving positions improves his CA significantly since the stats remain the same but the value they have is increased. Bale did not become a more talented player, he's still the same dude, however you find the position that suits his ability allowing him to be better. Given enough time and practice I'm sure bale would have become a world-class left back too, he's just a talented football player. He may never have fulfilled his potential, true, but that is due to the talents of the player not lining up with the abiliteis needed for the position.   What the game SHOULD do IMO is two things: first, make young players have categorical rather than fixed PA's, meaning a youngster could have a -10 potential rating until he's about 17-18. If you're unaware, -10 potential rating is right now used in the game databases to quantify existing players' talents. It's why not all possible wonderkids in the wonderkid lists end up acually being wonderkids. -10 potential gives a player a PA of anywhere between 170/200 and 200/200. Right now players are only generated using this -10 potential and given a fixed PA after generating. I feel this should remain in place a bit longer.   Second, I'd like to see youngsters be more flexible, meaning they should be able to play more positions when they're young and the ability to play positions you're not using them in should decrease over time. This would allow for a more accurate calculation of CA and give better allocation of ability points over time as well."
footballmanagergames,3bafcu,Ikestar,2,Sat Jun 27 14:11:28 2015 UTC,"Ok, I think we're talking about two different things.  Unless you look outside the game (in an editor for example) you don't know a player's true PA.  You know only what your scouts or coaches say.  The better they are, the better they can judge a player's potential, but AFAIK they only judge that potential in positions where they player is seen playing.  So Tottenham's in-game coaches would have seen him as a mediocre fullback with a possibility of becoming a pretty good fullback but wouldn't have seen his potential ability as a winger because he never really played there.  What I'd like is for the game to secretly know that if Bale remains at FB the highest he'll ever reach is 3 stars for that position (I know that's all relative to the team but...), but if he's moved to left wing he has the potential to hit 5 stars.  I'd like the coaches / scouts to not be able to give accurate guesses of how he'll do as a left winger until he's given some game time there and retrained a bit, but if you take Bale when he's a 1.5 star left back and retrain him as a right winger, you're ""rewarded"" in a few months by seeing his potential ability for that position (as assessed by your coaches) climb to 5 stars.  Maybe under the hood his potential ability number doesn't change at all, but the game recognises that certain key attributes for a position will never be met by a player, so his coach-judged PA for that role is fairly low (like say Bale had poor positioning and no matter how much you focus on it it will never be great) but in the new position the in-game coaches start to realise that all the things that held him back as a fullback are no longer relevant.  I agree with youngsters being more flexible too.  In most real youth teams most players get shuffled around as needed based on injuries and so on.  Even if they're amazing at one position, sometimes they're moved somewhere else to give another kid a chance, or sometimes just to help them develop as players.  Even if a player has never played a certain position before, the main knock against them shouldn't be that they're not used to the position, it should be that they're kids, so their concentration isn't great, their decisions are sometimes suspect, etc."
footballmanagergames,3bafcu,immerc,2,Sat Jun 27 14:33:59 2015 UTC,"The difference in what you're saying compared to what I'm saying is that Ive used the editor to figure this sort of thing out because it annoyed me when I didn't know.   Maybe I didn't put it clear enough, but what you're saying is basically what the game is intended to do already. Ability points don't count equally for every position, so a bale would never reach his potential as a fullback since his ability points are already put into other, more winger friendly spots. So his max CA as a fullback will already make him a lesser wing back than he could be a winger.  Like I said earlier, the only thing I'm not sure about is the position change on true CA under the hood. Could be that the default natural is sort of considered primary forever, which would mean a player like bale could be a beast since he's increasing his winger skills, though some of those don't necessarily impact the true CA in a significant enough way, as he's still counted as a fullback by the game. It's an interesting thing to look in to for sure, I'll so that soon ish"
footballmanagergames,3bafcu,Ikestar,22,Sat Jun 27 15:26:14 2015 UTC,"Less goals. Scoring a goal should feel like a big deal, the way it does in real football. Stop the perpetual transfer offers. I hate how I'll receive an offer for a player, turn it down, and then have the other team just keep offering the exact same price, over and over again. Real Madrid offers $20 million. No. Real Madrid offers $20 million. No. Real Madrid offers $20 million. etc. Have those transfer categories actually mean something. Like, when I list a player as ""indispensible,"" make it so the only clubs who are willing to move on him are the truly enormous clubs. Also, make a category that isn't quite transfer listed, but makes it clear to other clubs that you are taking offers. Make it easier to move off players. I hate how hard it is to shed dead wood in this game. Tottenham are about to sell Paulinho for 15 million pounds. It happens in real life. Why can't it happen in game?"
footballmanagergames,3bafcu,aeisenst,6,Sat Jun 27 14:09:52 2015 UTC,"I hate the repetitive offers as well. Also, if you list a player as indispensable but know he is destined for a bigger club, be able to say, he will only be moving after the season is over, or once I get knocked out of promotion/playoff position or even once a tournament is over.I think this is pretty realistic."
footballmanagergames,3bafcu,vette91,19,Sat Jun 27 16:14:31 2015 UTC,"Get rid of the ridiculous long flat throws.  No team has really used them since Stoke did a few years ago, and they're really not that effective in real life.  In FM the players set up as if it's a corner kick and in many cases that means that a throw-in from near the halfway line becomes a corner kick.  The players are also very slow to get out of their box once the throw is taken, so it turns a ball being knocked out near the halfway line into a scramble in the box."
footballmanagergames,3bafcu,immerc,10,Sat Jun 27 12:33:54 2015 UTC,"I don't think they should be removed, however, I think they should be much harder to train; it should take years to make someone into Rory Delap II and some players just shouldn't be able to do it at all."
footballmanagergames,3bafcu,DaWolf85,11,Sat Jun 27 16:15:51 2015 UTC,"It should require a ""Long throws"" value of 20 or 19 for it to result in a corner-kick like event.  In my save Cesar Azpilicueta can do Delap throws from nearly the halfway line with a ""long throws"" value of 17.  Maybe he can throw the ball long, but I've never seen a Delap style throw from him."
footballmanagergames,3bafcu,immerc,3,Sat Jun 27 16:36:00 2015 UTC,"what is really needed is the criteria needed for the team to do a long throw to be upped, i.e. 1-0 down at 10 min left, a stonking great target man on the field, etc"
footballmanagergames,3bafcu,batti02,18,Sat Jun 27 23:22:34 2015 UTC,"Better counter-attacking when defending corners.  I often have a winger stay forward.  What I'd expect to happen is when the ball is cleared to him, or to somewhere near him, he'll chase it down and burst forward into space.  The defenders the opponent leaves deep should try to shepherd him wide to give their teammates time to get back.  Instead what seems to happen is that that player stalls with the ball at his feet or calmly plays a pass backwards.  This is especially frustrating when the opposing player has slow players staying deep on the corner."
footballmanagergames,3bafcu,immerc,4,Sat Jun 27 12:21:49 2015 UTC,"And especially, especially frustrating when you're set to counter attack, and they don't actually sodding counter properly when given the opportunity!"
footballmanagergames,3bafcu,miomike,48,Sat Jun 27 15:53:07 2015 UTC,I hope this every year. They need to bring in academies. And have the ability to scout areas for promising academy players. I want to be able to make a legend that I have developed since they were 12/13/14.

footballmanagergames,3bafcu,Snikhop,24,Sat Jun 27 09:36:12 2015 UTC,"Increased/decreased frequency of certain things too. Players at the byline to actually cut it back rather than belt it into the side netting. Defenders to not dive into tackles when facing their own goal so that they end up making the perfect through ball to another forward (this one kills me). Players to know how to do a low, hard cross (I know low crosses are an option but they're never along the ground or resemble anything like they do in real life).  So many little niggles like this bug me."

It should be a small chance, but it's a real factor in real football - players who are good on the pitch but a PR nightmare off it; as a manager you have to factor that in when deciding whether to buy a  Suarez, a Balotelli or a Barton, and there's always the chance that they'll do something utterly beyond the pale and the board will sack them out of hand. Or if not, then you have to manage the expectations of the fans and media (condemn this disgraceful behaviour) with those of the dressing room (stand by your player)."
footballmanagergames,3bafcu,Brickie78,8,Sat Jun 27 14:09:57 2015 UTC,I heard somewhere that they don't include 'off-pitch drama' with real players for legal reasons. That's why only regens miss training due to a night drinking.

footballmanagergames,3bafcu,chickentrousers,12,Sat Jun 27 21:39:54 2015 UTC,"Some aspects of the game has actually gone backwards the last years, and I want them back to at least a decent level.   Goalkeeping is just horrible in FM15. The positioning is awful, leaving half the goal empty at times. Especially if a pass is intercepted, the goalkeepers keep moving in the same direction way to long, leaving the goal wide open for an opponent to slot it in, from 20 meters...  Another goalkeeping aspect, which also is generally defending. The recovery time after a save is so long. The amount of times that I've lost a game due to a free kick, where my goalkeeper punches it straight out, and lies down for 15 seconds, while my defense are frozen to the ground, while an opponent slowly jogs to the ball and slots it in an empty net. The bullshit defending overall. I mean, I know it can't be perfect, but defenders just pushing up for no reason, leaving tons of space behind, and worst of all. Full backs breaking the offside trap by ""following"" the attacker 15 meters to the side, leaving the attacker 2 meters onside, but completely unmarked.  Please make the easy side pass to a tap in, instead of shooting from a ridiculous angle into the side netting. Player interactions, what the fuck happened? It was kind of functional a couple of years ago, but now it's like all the players went to special school, and can't understand basic sentences. Squad building. How come that after all these years, FM can't properly simulate a good transfer and squad strategy. A team that plays with 1 striker has no need for 6 forwards, all world-class with 100k a week. Better national team management. The interactions are stupid, the media even more stupid (why should I bench the player who scored 8 in the last World cup just because he had 1 bad game at the club?).  Mostly a problem for ""smaller"" national teams, but Sweden becomes unmanageable after 10-15 years in game, since the Swedish league gets absolutely filled with foreign players, and no Swedish players are even remotely close to getting a first team spot. I'm currently in 2021, and there's not a Swedish regen in the highest tier, which is completely ridiculous, since the biggest income for Swedish clubs are developing and selling young Swedish talent."
footballmanagergames,3bafcu,fullpung,12,Sat Jun 27 15:43:19 2015 UTC,Use FM16 with save games from old versions of FM.  It's a shame to abandon the team you've spent so much time building up. It would be great if you could keep that team and still get the new features.

footballmanagergames,3bafcu,gonferreira,29,Sat Jun 27 10:39:55 2015 UTC,Good idea.  A substitute going in cold because of an injury shouldn't do as well as one who you've been warming up for 10 minutes.

footballmanagergames,3bafcu,ICritMyPants,12,Sat Jun 27 21:52:48 2015 UTC,"The way player ratings work needs some adjusting imo.    Goalkeeper ratings are bad. If your team smashes someone, they get a really good rating despite doing nothing, yet if they makea lot of top saves they are often sitting on a rating of below 7.5, it's extremely rare to see a GK win PotM, while in real life you see game-saving performances from keepers all the time. A defender scores a goal and all of a sudden they have a rating of 8+, regardless of whether they've been poor defensively. They should be marked on defensive qualities, and like the GK, defenders rarely get a good rating for just solid defensive work. Ratings for key passes are really broken atm. I have a right-back who achieves a 9 rating every game because of long throws, and have had CM's like Eriksen getting a 9 rating every game because of key passes which don't actually seem to have much of an affect on the game. Strikers often get really low ratings just for missing a few shots. Someone can be making a lot happen vs tough opposition yet sit on a 6.3 rating because they missed a one-on-one. Then bam, they score and suddenly 8 rating. What? Similarly, scoring a tap-in shouldn't massively boost a player's rating."

Even know coaching skills such as negotiating, having a network can bring in cheaper construction for a new stadium, having poor negotiating skills means the construction team can take longer and cost more money.  I also think that we should be able to deal more with sponsorship. If I think I'm going to do amazing this next season and get promoted, I want to be able to  renegotiate a contract stating just that. +15% for getting promoted, - 2% for not getting promoted(not meeting expectations basically) and - 30% for getting relegated. Also, i think that sponsorships should have something to do with club reputation and player reputation. If a shitty new energy drink company wants to come in and pay 1.5x as much as addidas, I should be able to take that but with the potential that they go belly up and go under and stop paying us which would hurt our reputation.(I'm a colorado rapids fan and this happened last year with a sketchy telecom company from Brazil or something http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_27552034/colorado-rapids-search-new-jersey-sponsor-ciao-logo)  Also while on sponsors, choosing sponsors from different countries could increase jersey sales. If I'm an American team but get a jersey sponsor from some caribbean country and I do a preseason tour there, I have 2 international players from Jamaica, I would expect jersey sales to go through the roof.  Maybe players having sponsor duties as well which ties into reputation?"

footballmanagergames,3bafcu,immerc,11,Sat Jun 27 12:04:25 2015 UTC,"AI not getting the easy transfers compared to you (you offer 10m, rejected, they offer 5m, ACCEPTED (note I am not their rival, i.e Southampton asking Udinese) Unhappy players forcing a move to you. Doesn't work, they just stay unhappy, and the ai NEVER FUCKING LETS THEIR PLAYER LEAVE TO YOU. Only has some instances where they go unhappy where you didn't affect them, then they sell. Improved match engine. Really, the improvements this year didn't feel like much. AI GK still suck (make a save, afk) and there's a lot of ""cross for goals"" still. The interaction looks too odd, and players make stupid ass passes EVERY TIME (if you set to key moments only, you will notice how often it's always just ""I have time on the ball, BLAST IT HALFWAY ACROSS THE PITCH""). It would be better if key moments also included more saves, as it seems key moments only ever have like 1 save every 10 games you watch. It should look spectacular. AI overspending for no reason (where do they get all this transfer money from...?) and then proceed to dump the player as a sub. Improved pep talks. This is minor, but all you do is spam * X X X (i.e passionately, calmly) ""you weren't that bad, but I believe in you!"" and it works. There's no drawback to this speech at all, only that sometimes (rarely) player's dont turn green and ""fired up"". Works most of the time and you don't need to do anything else. Player interaction. Holy this is a mess. People get bitchy when you congratulate them, and then when they score a hattrick and you say GOOD JOB, they get pissy cause they think they were a sack of shit...? There's no way you can tell in game, but 100% if you score a hattrick you did AT LEAST DECENT. It seems to revolve around a random ""screw you"" or ""I love you coach"" dial. Also, when a player wants to leave, they can basically ruin your squad through this. But for AI? Doesn't affect them it seems. All the time I see an unhappy player on a team, it says ""hasn't affected other squadmates."" Well great. I sure love that. Improved match engine simming. This is a big one. I hate how for some fucking reason, I lose to Bournemouth who is 20th with -45 fucking goals against, and I'm 3rd. I understand that it happens, where you lose to a lucky goal if you're a good team and all, BUT THIS IS STUPID SIMMING. It turns into a game where they have 60% possession, all the shots, 5-2 in goals, and dominate everywhere. Oh yeah somehow they just became barcelona eh? It's worse cause I have tested this a few times, and I lost like 4-6 of the simulations. It's horseshit. I feel the game has this thing for you to lose random matches just cause, and with no good explanation. Shit teams almost never win by dominating a match, they get lucky most of the time, and have to play a very defensive game for the most part. They don't turn into a full attacking squad with their 11 finishing striker. Tutoring improvements. I feel like tutoring is a hit/mis. Sometimes it works,. sometimes it doesn't. In game it feels different. It's almost a con to do it, cause like 90% of the time the players refuse, or end up incompatible, even with similar personalities. Improved finishing. Players seem to miss one-on-one's way too often. More types of shots. I don't recall ever seeing a finesse shot ever done in the game, but it happens a lot in football where a player runs from the outside of the box and tries to blast it. But 90% of the key moments goals are all just corners, crossing, and very rarely a shot that's not from either. Improved Coach report. I love this feature in 15, and it looks nice. IT would be better if it was made more clear, like ""we have a determined group of players, and X...."" is odd, because it's a pro OR a con, for some reason? The tendency to not get into rough challenges makes me think (not sure) that the player doesn't go for the battle when it's up for grabs I guess? It's a good feature imo, and I would like some more clarity on some of the options, as well as new ones.  Better stat balancing. 20 should mean the person is the best of the best at it, and for some reason the top 5 defenders in the game don't have 20 in marking/tackling, but fucking Papadopoulos has 20 in marking and 18 tackling? There are other stats, yeah, but if you are one of the best defenders in the world, I would think that 20 should be on one of your stats for defending, or 19. But Papadopoulos has 20? Wtf? Better halftime. It would be cool to have something like directions to give a certain player. Pep talk doesn't do anything but say something like ""i believe in you"" ""play better"". Something like ""go for the direct attack"" at half time would be cool, or tell a certain player to focus more on passing, crossing, tracking back, rather than altering your strategy all over the place again. Sort of like NBA 2K15, where in myplayer, at halftime your coach will give a few pointers on what they want done this time around."

I offered to clubs originally for £2 million and no offers, then for £1.5 million still no offers, then for £1 million STILL no offers, then finally for £500,000 and I got a non-negotiable offer for £100,000 and I rejected because he's worth much more.

footballmanagergames,3bafcu,MrNextgen,6,Sat Jun 27 10:13:35 2015 UTC,"Smarter zonal marking, and smarter man marking.  When I'm zonally marking, I'm tired of my CMs going out to mark a winger while my FB stays back, leaving a key player unmarked in the middle.  It gets even worse when up against a strange formation.  The game keeps saying ""we're being overrun in midfield"" when it's clearly because some players are marking empty space and not drifting to where there's a player.  For man marking, the player shouldn't blindly follow his target everywhere, just when it makes sense.  If I tell my FB to mark the opposing winger and the opposing winger swaps sides, my FB should switch to zonal marking or stick tight to the winger who's now on his side, he shouldn't chase the original winger across the pitch.  It should be about sticking tight to the target when he's in your zone, let him go if he leaves it, then latch on again if he comes back."

Probably won't have much value to most of this crowd, but the game has such a steep learning curve that it's a real barrier to entry for new players.  - I wouldn't mind them adding at least the capacity for women's leagues/tournaments.  - It's mentioned at least one or two other times here: but i'd enjoy a ""new team"" option.

In a match if you tell them to play direct, it should be ""direct for Barcelona"" and if you tell them to ""retain possession"" it should be ""retain possession even more than normal, don't allow the other team to touch the ball"".  A club like Dortmund should be trying to counter attack at every opportunity, not just when they are set to ""attack"" or ""counter"".  When they're set to defensive they should only commit 2-3 players to the counter, but it should be something they always try to do, while if they're set to attack almost the entire team should burst forward when they get possession."

But to be more specific. The AI for players and team management is completely broken. And they have only made slight adjustments to it to ""fix it"" after all the complaints. It's simply not good enough.  Training needs to be returned to it's origins. They had it perfect a few years back. You could set group or individual schedules where you determined how much focus each player put in each area. Now you simply play match the stars with coaches. And what's worse, the individual training focus seems to be broke too. It is often either ineffective or the player won't like it.  Staff recommendations are nearly always terrible. I'm in the Premier League and constantly getting advised to scout players that will never make it in the Championship. No my defender does not need to work on his shooting from long range thanks. And I don't know where my assistant learned to give team talks but with a high motivation I expect him to get one green response from a player.  The transfer market also needs a revamp.

If they're on too high wages: cut them.  Get a lot of loans, but don't agree to pay wages, be patient there will be plenty of clubs higher up willing to loan you them free, especially if you have a parent club.  Build a squad with 50% decent loan players and 50% signed players and the debt should start to reduce."

It's not the in the time scale you're thinking.  FM comes into it's own after months. It's unlikely you're going to see any chance in your team for at least 1-2 months as it'll take your team at least that long to learn the system you want to use. That doesn't even include things like signing players, squad harmony and other variables I can't think of right now.  FM really comes into it's own after 1-2 years when you see the players you've signed adapt to the way you play. I like to sign players as young as I can then I know they have 4-6 years at my club improving stats for the role I've intended for them.  Hopefully that should give some insight."

footballmanagergames,3bb083,TLG_BE,3,Sat Jun 27 14:52:07 2015 UTC,"From my experience of the game I have only encountered what you describe. Squad roles determining how much first team football they expect and their wage demands in contract negotiations. I don't think players would perform worse or ""play down to their role"" as you describe. Surely any first team minutes are going to help with their development. Other factors will make them perform worse, such as morale and team talk etc."
footballmanagergames,3bb083,hotpointGG,2,Sat Jun 27 15:29:43 2015 UTC,"In my experience no.  I do as you do and I've been playing for quite some time. There is no upside to offering someone a key role other then getting them to sign in the first place.   One last note, try to get your players off non-contracts where you can afford to. Players don't train as much as they would on full time or part time contracts."
footballmanagergames,3bb4af,oreopoptartman,9,Sat Jun 27 15:02:05 2015 UTC,"Ah, here we go. What would go down as arguably the greatest CL final in history, I was a part of. I was the manager of Southampton in FM13. With a somewhat rich owner, great academy, and great management from myself, we had been to quite a few CL finals and won most. Our arch-rivals in the tournament should be PSG, where we lost in the 117th minute off a backpass. However, playing them year in and year out, Barcelona became our rivals. One year, my young Southampton squad went up against an amazing Barcelona squad. After the first half, we were down 1-0, not playing bad but I just had a feeling we might not win. My young RWB in his debut season got sent off late in the first half off a second yellow. Damn. In the 52nd minute my 19 y/o academy CB got a second yellow as well. I was fucked, down to 9 men down 1-0. I played a 4-3-1, with my RB being my target man (who was old as hell and a winger). Somehow, my only CM in the formation gets a pass and does a quick turn to send my young poacher, Christian Feldhoff, on his way to goal. We were level. Perhaps we can hold on until penalties. In nearly the same play, only a few minutes later, Christian Feldhoff is given a through ball by my CM and beats 3 people to get through on goal. 2-1! My RB/target man commits a hilarious foul outside the box, and I decide his 8 tackling should be replaced by a true right back. So I sub one in. Soon my striker is away from the high pushing Barcelona defense, and finishes his hattrick! 3-1, 90th minute! Down 2 men, up 2 goals. I took my pants off and was running around the house. We won, we fucking won. This is what FM is about, moments like this."

footballmanagergames,3bb4af,Poet-Laureate,2,Sat Jun 27 16:27:21 2015 UTC,"So a few months back my attention was faltering with FM15... As it does with every FM game every year. I normally always stat a save with Hearts, because they're my team I support over anyone in the world. Anyway, I was about 20 years in and Hearts were the best in the world (I was even in the Online Leaderboard 2nd/3rd, I was very proud and wish I had taken a screenshot before I took a sabbatical from the game for a few months).   Anyway, I started a new save, with Barcelona, and it is absolutely wonderful. The whole transfer embargo really makes it exciting, and some will say, ""Barça? Easy mode for FM!"". And yeah it is at first, the league is walkable, back to back CL finals (lost both) are easy to attain, but I've been having so much fun, simply because they have captivated my attention, any loss could send my team into a downward spiral (it's happened before), and some cunt mouthing off about my team talk can make the board likely to sack me.   I don't normally stick with a ""big"" team for this many seasons, but I have thoroughly enjoyed winning La Liga after La Liga and then losing CL finals to stupid defensive mistakes thanks to Batra (he got sold, cunt) and then strengthening my squad thanks to major profits.   So that is how my love of FM15 was recaptured."

footballmanagergames,3bb4af,podunkboy,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:19:13 2015 UTC,"Got bored with the 3-4 (okay, maybe 5-6) different saves I'm concurrently running (No, it's not ADD, it's like reading several books at the same time, or following several TV series), so I DL'ed a huge Spain extended database that goes down to the local amateur level, holiday'ed the database for a year, started with the Sunday Leaguer/No Badges set-up, unemployed. Took a interview with CDC Moscardo, a 4th-level Madrid-based semi-pro, board expectations were to challenge for the title. The cabinet wasn't exactly bare, picked up a couple loaners (where I encountered the first problem, in the 4th level, you can only have 4 players over 22 registered for a game, and I had 8). Fortunately, it's a game-by-game registration situation, so I juggled every around to keep them happy, and walked the league with 6 games to spare.  Promotion brings a limit of 6 players over 22, but with another year of aging, I now had 10. Boards expections were make the promotion playoffs, but we're already heavily in debt with only a small increase in budget. Fortunately, the lads are mostly happy and the team moves up the standing to hold first place at the first quarter of the season. Only problems: the board won't pay for any coaching certifications, facilities have downgraded, and the board would love to see some income from selling off the few players with value who are keeping us up. Oh, and every week, I'm getting 2-3 job offers from teams in other divisions deep in their relegation zone, wanting me to come talk to them about taking over. Although it's certainly TEMPTING to move to a broken and likely divided squad and try to fix someone else's mess instead of remaining at a club mired in a worsening financial crisis...I like the lads of Moscardo, they're a scrappy bunch, and they seem to have good chemistry. If we can somehow climb into the 2nd division, maybe we can scrape two pennies together and make the climb to the top. But then...I got an in-box item tonight about a squad already in the 2nd division, wonder what they're offering?"

footballmanagergames,3b9cnh,ClandestineMovah,6,Sat Jun 27 02:40:39 2015 UTC,"I had some stupid draws and losses early on, was actually sitting in second all the way through March. Only one of my draws was goalless, and four of my five losses were by a single goal. The fifth was an irritating 0-2 loss to ManC late in the season.  This was actually the result of a tactical tweak I made early in the season- I added a bunch of individual player instructions where previously I had none, part of which was to ensure that one of my two strikers would get the ball more and shoot more. It seems to have worked, as he scored 40 league goals and smashed the record for Premier League goals in a season (37, previously set by Romelu Lukaku) and came within 3 goals of the club record for total goals in a season (50, also set by Lukaku). I had 13 league matches where I scored 5 goals or more, including an 8-1 thrashing of Sunderland and a 9-0 schooling of poor little Oxford. My second striker also finished in the top 4 for goals scored, I swept the average rating column, and my two wingers outran everybody else in assists. Evidence of stats, and the record-breaking striker himself  I'm definitely going to carry this into next season and see how it does.

LW - Winger, Support, ST- Target Man, Attack, RW - Inside Forward, Attack.  I love this formation, works with pretty much most teams. With good wingers, and a striker that can finish, this formation is awesome. I mostly play on the counter, and tell my team to play wider. I normally use it for when I am the weaker team, however, if you are the stronger team, push your defensive midfielder up into CM, or even CAM, for a 433, or a 4231.

We just destroy every team in Gib. Hoping someone else turns professional soon -_-  Champions League Tactic - It's a similar 4-1-3-2 but full backs are set to defend, my defensive mid fielder and center midfielder all drop back. It's been a great tactic. In our second ever group stage we've beat Bayern twice, Lost 1-0 to Napoli, and had a draw and win against Athletico.

The wingers themselves grab a lot of goals due to me floating early crosses and volleying the crosses the other provides. I'll post screens later"

Yes, typically Barca are going to steam-roll over lesser teams but if the conditions are right then it's more than possible for a small team to beat a big team.  That's why the first goal is critical. If it's scored by the bigger team they can take their foot of the pedal and slow play down and if it's scored by the smaller team the bigger team need to push on which leaves them open to the counter.  I love FM."

footballmanagergames,3b7b6a,N1dh0gg_,5,Fri Jun 26 18:55:49 2015 UTC,"A lot of smaller leagues, especially in Asia, have limits on the number of foreign players you can bring in. In Malaysia we can only have 3 foreign players, so I try to make sure those foreigners are the best I can possibly find. Also, try to find a team with young players or good youth facilities. Because of the aforementioned foreigner rules, you'll want to start churning out good home grown players so you can stop relying on internationals  Where obscure leagues really separate themselves from large leagues is in continental competitions. Forget getting your team to qualify for the Champions' League, you're going to need to get your entire league up a notch if you want to qualify automatically. Even then, pretty any team in the competition has at least a chance at beating you.  Obscure leagues can be frustrating, but also insanely rewarding when you finally drag you team up to continental dominance."

footballmanagergames,3b58zp,trebor04,7,Fri Jun 26 02:03:57 2015 UTC,"From the moment I bought FM15, I've only ran two major saves. I had a couple other little saves, but nothing for quite the while. My first major save, when I bought the game, was an MLS save with the Seattle Sounders. After a few years and some trophies with them, I went to Chelsea, and managed the Ukraine, Turkish, France, and Algerian national teams. Now I'm on my second major save, with Newcastle United. I was manager with Argentina but got fired after a less-than-spectacular but not-totally-my-fault performance in the 2018 world cup, so now I'm manager of Spain.  I've also ran Arsenal, West Ham, Philadelphia Union, Columbus Crew and San Jose Earthquakes in my past. I tend to stick to the MLS and BPL, as they're my two fav leagues. And for whatever reason, no matter what, I can never seem to jump over to Bundesliga with FC Bayern. They've approached me countless times, but I'm usually enjoying life with my club and the legacy I've built. Like in my current save, I have Munir, Neymar, Kevin De Bruyne, Luciano Vietto, Emre Can, Michael Bradley, Kurt Zouma, Niklas Sule, Samuel Umtiti, Caner Erkin, and Tim Krul running my first team. How much more do you need? That's like perfect there."

Usually quit the save at around 2-3 seasons into the game, about time when the team becomes sort of unbeatable.  EDIT: Forgot to add the national teams as well. First one was Spain U21, didn't do great. Then France. Pretty good but lost to Belgium in the Euros semis with Andre Villas Boas as their manager.

Managing in the San Marino league was pretty limited as you could really only grow your team so far. Im not sure if I would have been able to reach professional status but if I did, maybe then it would have been better, but its basically impossible to attract any overseas talent, and the whole league is amateur so you can just sign the best players from the other clubs for $0 and dominate constantly."

There's surely more but I'll add some detail to more memorable saves:  Skoda Xanthi (FM 08) - Somehow conspired to win the Greek Superleague in my first season then went on to become perennial challengers for a couple more. Exams got in the way, but one of my best FM achievements.  Getafe (FM 09) - First action was to sell Soldado to Valencia and sign Oscar Cardozo who went on to fire me to Europe within 2 seasons and a Copa del Rey final. We then had a couple of decent years until my wheeling and dealing caught up and we stagnated.Final season of mid table and 0 GD with something like 40 or 50 points led to Zenit seeing my potential and we quickly won 3 domestic doubles, 2 UEFA semis and a Champs League 1/4 final. Moved on to the new FM at this point.  AEK (FM 14) - Thought I'd create a Greek dynasty. Got promoted after a less than impressive first season, sold a few players for a lot of money thinking they'd be easy to replace. They weren't, new players didn't adjust to my system (or I didn't adjust to them) so I resigned at Christmas, just in the drop zone. Quickly took an offer in Turkey with Kayserispor, same aims, doing a much better job this time. This is my current save. AEK are now flying high..."

I started unemployed in the hopes to get a job in the Primera División. Got approached by Instituto, a team struggling not to get relegated from the B Nacional (Argentina's second division) played a couple matches, and after a month of failure, I resigned. After a couple of weeks, I see that Colón, Olimpo and Argentinos Jrs. from the Primera División have no manager employed, so i decide to apply for all three of them. I get offered a job interview at Argentinos Jrs. After talking for a while with president Luis Segura, I finally get the job. It was mid-season, and I have my first official match as Argentinos's boss against Olimpo. I win, 3-0 actually. I finished the season fulfilling my expectations in a 19th place from 30 teams. After having a good start in my second season managing the club, I get into a bad streak, without winning for five matches. In the meantime, I suffered as the team I'm fan of, Independiente, wasn't doing so well. Independiente's manager finnally gets sacked. I apply for the job. But, even though they are flattered by my interest, they couldn't afford the compensation fee [for anyone who doesn't know, Independiente is one of the ""5 grandes"" (five giants) and the only club to have 7 Libertadores, but is struggling with a financial crisis right now] so I resign my position at Argentinos and get a job interview at Independiente. After talking to President Moyano, I get offered the managerial position at the club I love, and without doubting it, accept the offer.

And we both took our teams to the Premier League. I believe I was Yeovil Town. And we discovered that when you play with 10 men in midfield/attack you'd basically win every game between 5-0 and 10-1. Great times. I produced one huge player from the youth or was it just new players back then - I can't remember. But his name was Tom Yore. That I do remember (after 20 years)  CM2 - started with Mansfield, then Chelsea - won everything with Chelsea  had a break of gaming...  FM10 - there was a belgian league up to tier 8 - so I chose my home-club. One I played for when I was a kid: SK Merelbeke. Took them to Belgian 2nd League by winning every season. 2nd league was hard without funds. Took up managing KV Kortrijk in Belgian 1st League. Saved them from relegation.  FM14 now - I know I am an odd guy - I play odd leagues.. FC Cahul in 3rd tier Moldova. Took them to 1st league in 2 Seasons, then relegated and got sacked. Switched to FC Veris Chisinau. Won Moldovan Cup. Lost Title in last game by playing 1-1 and equal points with Sheriff and only 2 goals less..   Now waiting for a bit faster laptop. Then I will do a larger campaign.

I'm not a Gunners fan by any stretch but I always liked that they were the underdog to Man U.    I also had a game-breaking save with Real Madrid featuring a striker, David Aganzo, that was nothing special attributes-wise but scored over 100 goals a season for me. He once scored 11 goals in a game. I really felt like I was cheating.    Nowadays I always start with Coventry City (hometown club) and whatever mess they're in.

My recurring teams are Torquay United, Athletic, Everton, St. Pauli, Bath City - I play as these teams pretty much every year. Other teams I regularly manage are Leverkusen, Palermo, Toulouse, Wolves, Rio Ave, Seattle Sounders. If I wan't to play as an elite team I choose Barcelona or Man Utd, but that doesn't happen often. I also regularly start unemployed in a small league.  By far my favourite club to manage is Athletic - I like the Basque only policy. It forces me to rely on my youth system and to regularly change formation and tactics depending on the players that come through. I really like Everton on FM15, though. I'm currently on my 4th Everton save this game. They've got a great young team, decent saleable assets, and just enough money to stay competitive. My first season I sold Kevin Mirallas, Aiden McGeady and Steven Pienaar for ~27m, and replaced them with Karim Bellarabi, Pione Sisto, and Andre Ayew for ~15m, which left me enough money to sign Balanta as well. I finished 3rd playing 442. Second season I sold Naismith for 10m and replaced him with Aboubakar for 20m. Currently 2nd in the league and qualified for the knockout stages in the Champions League.

It clearly resonated with me as I picked Motherwell in FM11, 5 years on.   Adelaide United: FM11: Dominated both domestically and continentally in the Asian Champions League. Got to the 2030s in the game and Australia won the bid to host the World Cup in 2034 with our renovated stadium hosting the final. That has to be one of the most satisfying things I've seen on a manager game  Galway United: FM12: Dominated Ireland for a long time and became Champions League group stage regulars, though the furthest I made it was the first knockout round. I ended up leaving Galway for Man City and donated them my entire budget of over £100m by purchasing one of their reserves. I left Man City the same day  FC Ufa: FM13: Probably the most memorable. Won the second tier in Russia first season, despite being predicted to finish bottom. Survived on the last day of the season after by beating CSKA 2-1 at their ground. Still don't know how we managed that. Years of building the team and infrastructure lead us to dominate Russia year on year and we slowly established ourselves in Europe. I eventually made it to the final of the CL, where we lost 1-0 in extra time against Juventus. The year after we faced Man Utd in the final... and lost 2-1... in extra time. I stopped playing the save after that moment, it was too much heartache to continue. I left FC Ufa as the 2nd most reputable team in the world."

footballmanagergames,3b4oen,wiggums5,7,Thu Jun 25 23:03:25 2015 UTC,"Depends on your goals for the save. Do you want to turn a club into a world powerhouse, or travel around and win competitions in different countries? Germany is fun as there are no transfer restrictions. England imo is still the overall most 'fun' country, given the number of competitions and playable clubs, but I think it's best done later if you're going to be a journeyman.  When I first started playing FM, I was a one-club manager and got used to creating dynasties rather than moving about. Now I've been playing for 4/5 years, I'm moving clubs every few years."

footballmanagergames,3b52km,WhataHitSonWhataHit,2,Fri Jun 26 01:07:38 2015 UTC,"FM is a processor heavy game, so your best bet would be to invest more in a good i5/i7 processor."
footballmanagergames,3b52km,pwnmeindabutt,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:21:35 2015 UTC,"An i7 would be a waste of money. The only extra it has over an i5 is hyper-threading, which FM does not utilise. So OP should stick to an i5. Just look for the most common versions for a good one to pick, ones with a 'k' on the end of the name are unlocked for overclocking, and make sure to get one with integrated graphics if you aren't getting a GPU (although I guess you will be). I have an i5-3470, 3.2GHz, put in when I built my PC 18 months ago, and it serves me perfectly well.   And to expand to the rest of the question, 100% yes on an SSD, it will improve your whole computing experience, not just FM.   I have 8GB of RAM and manage just fine, never having need to go close to maxing that even having Netflix streaming on Chrome (which eats up RAM massively), FM and some coding in Visual Studio all open. I usually run a decent amount of leagues, 30 maybe, but if you want more and have the money, go for 16GB. Anything higher is unnecessary!"
footballmanagergames,3b52km,covmatty1,2,Fri Jun 26 16:29:55 2015 UTC,"If you are building a brand new PC I don't se any reason NOT to use SSD. One of the most noticable upgrades you can possibly make. For FM you won't be needing a very good graphics card, it's mostly processing power you need to quickly calculate all the data that is being generated.   SSD and a decent i5 CPU (i7 is overkill imo). RAM is cheap, so don't be afraid to get a shitload. You won't need a video card, integrated graphics will do the trick, but it won't hurt."
footballmanagergames,3b52km,MeatCigar,0,Fri Jun 26 07:22:28 2015 UTC,"i7 is overkill imo   I dunno, man, depends on your budget. My rig has a 4.0 ghz i7 processor (+ SSD and 32 gigs of RAM) and while the game plays pretty fast, it can always be faster. Unless OP is on a budget, a more efficient processor certainly wouldn't hurt."
footballmanagergames,3b52km,cyanidhogg,2,Fri Jun 26 08:18:36 2015 UTC,"yeah, couldn't hurt. It also makes your rig more future safe. If OP is on a budget though, a decent i5 should be more than enough."
footballmanagergames,3b52km,MeatCigar,1 point,Fri Jun 26 08:32:35 2015 UTC,I assume an i5 4690k would be decent enough ?
footballmanagergames,3b52km,XxDaft7xX,1 point,Fri Jun 26 10:54:31 2015 UTC,"i5 4690k   yeah, that should be good. better than what i've got at the moment, and i'm quite happy with how FM runs on my computer. This should give you a lot of bang for buck as well."
footballmanagergames,3b52km,MeatCigar,2,Fri Jun 26 11:00:55 2015 UTC,"I just built a computer with an i5-4460, 16Gb RAM, GeForce 960 and SSD, amongst other things.  All of those are overkill for FM, except perhaps the processor, but I needed/wanted them for other things.  I play FMC with 43 leagues loaded and a large database.  Game flies along, no problem.  If you have the money, I'd go as high up the i5 processor product line as I could, but I found the 4460 (which is basically the cheapest i5 you can get) to be more than adequate."

footballmanagergames,3b3oyu,jonahmilo_,2,Thu Jun 25 21:27:22 2015 UTC,"It's very difficult to say, besides that was just one game. You're not judging your team over one game.  if you're creating chances and not scoring it could simply be that you're rotating your strikers too much and they can't have a run in the team to become settled. You might not be rotating them enough and they're tired.  It could be the roles you've given them are incompatible to the stats or the system you're using."
footballmanagergames,3b3oyu,ClandestineMovah,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:50:58 2015 UTC,"As /u/SAeN said use the analysis tab to check where the shots are coming from. If a lot are from distance you have less chance of scoring, so tweak your tactics to work the ball into box, or see if any of your players have ""Shoots from distance"" as a preferred move."
footballmanagergames,3b3oyu,Bronn-Burgundy,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:54:24 2015 UTC,"Check on the analysis tab where the shots are coming from? If you're wasting possession by shooting too much from range then you can definitely change that.   Do you play to cross the ball a lot? Headers are going to miss more often than shots played with feet and so that could be why.  A more subtle reason, think about the speed with which you attack. If you're countering you might have strikers snatching at their chances. If you play slower and build up attacks through possession then it's possible that you are forcing the opponent into defending deep and your strikers will find it harder to find space to take good shots.  Of course it could just have been a bad day, it happens."
footballmanagergames,3b0m2x,trebor04,75,Thu Jun 25 00:34:11 2015 UTC,"Ah Ayub Daud, I remember him well...You see fellas, back in FM11 I was new to the game and decided to get closer to my roots. Right, so my grandpa who had recently passed(RIP gramps) was a Finnish Ex pat and would always talk about Finland, crazy language they've got.   So I decide to look up the national team, and as I'm sure you know. Some of the more prestigious records are held by the Great Jari Litmanen! Legend of Ajax and Europe in general if I may be so bold.   Anyways, when I look this guy up he's pushing 40...but he hasn't retired yet. He's still playing for his hometown team FC Lahti! A proud team who had fallen to the second division of Finnish football and were crying for a savior. I was that savior!   Funny thing about the Finnish league, almost all countries apart from a few in Asia are considered EU for them. This led me to throw 90$ per week contracts at almost any player I felt like on some of the smallest national teams in the world. Njaka Rafilibara from Madagascar, Michael Stephens from the U.S.  But you know who said no to me and went to my arch rivals? That's right Mr.0.1 himself. And boy did I make him regret it.   Homeboy lit the league on fire! He was smashing in goals and within a year we had both reached the premier league(of Finland) I continue to build, Wijnaldums left back brother, Juan Agudelo on a free. It's a good time to be a Black Drones fan. But meanwhile, Daud is still smashing in goals and collecting personal awards. But like the titanic battles between Wilt and Russell in the early days of the NBA I being the metaphorical Celtics had the better unit and Daud could never triumph over me.   I'd like to think that he thought of me right before he played this game. Thought of me as a single tear rolled down his cheek."

footballmanagergames,3b0m2x,CPiGuy2728,17,Thu Jun 25 00:56:43 2015 UTC,"No, there were no own goals in the game. He gave away a penalty, lost all three of his attempted headers and only made one attempted run, from what I can see from his stats. Not sure that warrants a 0.1 though..."
footballmanagergames,3b0m2x,Rapscallian,26,Thu Jun 25 01:08:39 2015 UTC,Yeah. You would have thought that you could only get a 0.1 if you switched sides and joined the opposition during the game...

footballmanagergames,3b3gq3,JMocks,-20,Thu Jun 25 17:42:13 2015 UTC,The center of the park is almost completely empty that's nothing like a 433
footballmanagergames,3b3gq3,Sermokala,18,Thu Jun 25 18:19:59 2015 UTC,...except for the three midfielders you are exactly right.
footballmanagergames,3b3gq3,rodders0223,-1,Thu Jun 25 19:38:46 2015 UTC,The anchor man is spending most of his time rotating with the cb line. The BBM won't do any midfield work when all his job is to sprint from defense extreme to offense extreme. In the end you have just one guy sitting in the circle being mobbed while everyone is a good 20 meters from him or more.
footballmanagergames,3b3gq3,Sermokala,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:06:45 2015 UTC,That's not a problem with the formation as much as it's a problem with the individual roles assigned to the midfielders. It's still a 433.
footballmanagergames,3b3gq3,mono-math,0,Fri Jun 26 10:21:21 2015 UTC,Yes it is a problem with the formation. with the FB's becoming wingbacks that means that the traditionally holding DM can't be the tempo decider of the team and must stay back to support the defender line. This leaves 2 midfielders responsible for the majority of the field.
footballmanagergames,3b3gq3,Sermokala,7,Fri Jun 26 21:40:18 2015 UTC,I'd make the DLP a roaming playmaker to give the 3 up front more support.
footballmanagergames,3b3gq3,calvesbrahh,2,Thu Jun 25 18:06:01 2015 UTC,Would suggest a few changes. Change the DLP to Support (no need for two defence duty midfielders in that team shape). Change one of the Raumdeuters to an IF/A and change the CF/A to a False 9.
footballmanagergames,3b3gq3,Jac412,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:26:10 2015 UTC,Only potential issue I see is the link between your front three and your midfield. Might want to have one winger who drops deeper or one of your midfield trio pushing further up.
footballmanagergames,3b3gq3,ecc164,2,Thu Jun 25 17:44:42 2015 UTC,The BBM already does that   Inverted wingbacks I believe are in order the wingers give you attacking depth and your midfield is almost deserted.
footballmanagergames,3b3gq3,Sermokala,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:18:35 2015 UTC,What out of the two would you suggest?
footballmanagergames,3b3gq3,Is_This_Democracy_,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:05:48 2015 UTC,"Depends mostly on how good your wingers are and how good the league is. If the wingers are good, drop the wingers. If the MC is good at attacking, make him move up the field. Or do both."
footballmanagergames,3b3gq3,PizzaLogisticsExpert,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:13:23 2015 UTC,I pretty much play that but with only one Ram and one Winger as it suites my players more. Works well for me and instructions on retaining possession and controlled play.

footballmanagergames,3aybl4,ericjames,6,Wed Jun 24 23:26:58 2015 UTC,"In my save, it's the opposite. PSG buy just about any player I care to transfer list, and are always happy to pay at least half over value, even if the player's well past thirty.

footballmanagergames,3aybl4,Supalio,8,Wed Jun 24 18:46:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, I put ""non-EU"" between quotes because the rules are a bit more complicated thant that.  Basically, if the player has a dual citizenship in the EU, it's OK (that's the case with most of the Argentines that are also Italian, and some of the Brazilians who are also Portuguese).  Also, all Africans (except maybe one or two rare countries) are OK, and almost all of Europe countries too even if they are non-EU (like Switzerland or Norway).  In the roster you linked, I think only Thiago Silva, Maxwell and Lucas are non EU. Not sure about David Luiz, but I think he's also Portuguese."

They had a stretch of 12 straight league wins and took over first from me until I beat them in late January. I'm in March now and I have a 1 point cushion.  I'm really worried I will drop points late in the season and lose the title race. Those bastards knocked me out of the League Cup and I'm worried I'm gonna get them in the Champion's League too. Luckily Arsenal just knocked them out of the FA Cup for me.

Now every time I do something good the press brings up that I ""previously suffered the ignominy of getting knocked out of the C1C by Swansea"" and it pisses me off all over again. The press are a buncha dicks sometimes lol.  But it looks like the league is about wrapped up now. Chelsea just lost back to back league games @City and @Villa. My lead has jumped from 2 points to 5 and I have a game in hand. My run-in is easy too with 4 of my 5 games against bottom half teams with the only tough game being Newcastle at home and that will be a revenge game since they beat me at St. James Park.  I lost 2-1 @Real Madrid in the first leg in the quarters in the CL but I feel confident I can turn it around at Old Trafford. Ronaldo dove to win a penalty in the 90th minute, what a SOB!"

footballmanagergames,3b29cq,jamiew0w,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:39:13 2015 UTC,"Because he asked to leave to play the CL, and given that he can't play (and win) the CL with PSG as he asked, I thought he was referring to the next year. Consider that he talked about playing, nobody talked about winning during the conversation but the promises tab reports that he wants to win."

The crux of it is that regardless of him already playing with you in the CL, he wants to play with PSG in the CL. I get that but sadly it's irrelevant. The part that's screwing you over is that you said you can win.  Try and think of conversations this way, every question you're asked, ignore the actual question - it becomes irrelevant after you answer it. Focus on what you're promising.   I want to join PSG to get more games. You're right, I'll give you a run of games here.   Outcome, all he cares about is getting more starts.   I want to leave to join PSG to play CL. You can win the CL here.   Outcome, he wants to win the CL at juve.  It's shitty but it's just how it is. Next time get assertive and use the ""no offer has come in, concentrate on your game"", usually they'll apologise and get back to work.  The only advice I can give you from here on out is to slap as big an asking price as you can on him (hopefully if he has a buyout clause it's 100m+, enough to scare anyone away) and he'll eventually get over it for long enough that you can get him on a new contract."

This will force the AI club to either hit your astronomical asking price or not bid. If they don't bid, you keep the player and they'll lose interest in leaving in usually a month or so."

I'm in 2024 so I'm playing with regens mostly. Actually I just won the Club World Championshp!!!  I was fucking lucky because the final was with Schalke not with Barcelona or Real and 2 of their players got injured and they had no subs so I won against 9 men.  http://i.imgur.com/uIChPpF.png  I can screencap some of my players tomorrow.

I started unemployed, got picked up by North Korea's top club. Stuck with them for a few years, finally won the President's Cup to get some continental attention. Then moved to Hangzhou Greentown in China, where in my third full season I won six competitions - struck lucky in the ACL final, beating Yokohama F Marinos on pens -  then beat Gremio and Man Utd to win the Club World Cup. I then resigned having won the ACL, and now I'm at Trabzonspor in Turkey and slowly building something there.  I will go back to Asia though, I want to manage either Consadole Sapporo or Kyoto Sanga."

I started in the second division of Tahiti, got promoted and won the OFC Champions League in the third year because the New Zealand teams were knocked out (lucky!). Then I moved to the third division on Saudi Arabia and stayed there for 4 years and I won everything in the 4th year except the ACL. I realized that no Saudi teams would ever win it because their players are just worse than the korean and japanese teams. So I moved to Japan and I won everything there. I was also the manager of the Cameroon national team. Got knocked out in the quarter-finals of the World Cup against Germany and won the African Cup of Nations. Before that, I managed Spain U23 just for the olympics and won it without any defeats. Now I'm managing Japan and I wanna win the Asian Nations Cup so I can move to a north american or south american national team. I will also manage Urawa Reds for like 1 or 2 more years and move to the african leagues."

Wasn't sure what to expect but it definitely feels really well polished especially as it's still in early access. It heavily reminded me of a cross between Blitzball from Final Fantasy X, and Pocket League Story, the mobile game by Kairosoft.  I'm not sure if it'll scratch that management itch, just because of how in-depth and consuming FM is, but it's certainly a nice break, and would work so well as a mobile game.   Have to say I was unsure about the premise, but after the first couple of matches I certainly got in to it and enjoyed the RPG elements such as levelling up of players post-match.  Just wondering what other things you're planning to add in the future? I know you mention multiplayer etc. but any thoughts in terms of features? I know you're not after feedback, but off the top of my head things like sponsorships (might already be in?) as either a) another source of income or b) provider of better equipment (I'm thinking in terms of boots or something?) Just a random thought that may be absolutely worthless :)"
footballmanagergames,3ay6eb,OffTheBench_,2,Wed Jun 24 18:51:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, we already have sponsorship deals. In the demo (the first season in Amateur league) you have already signed the deal, which gives you money for matches and wins. But starting from the next season you'll need to choose one of the three sponsor deals with different conditions.  Don't know, what features you are looking for. But in general we make everything to make players feel the pain and joy of real trainers but without micromanagement of FM-like games.   Our next big features (will be released in one month) - different weather conditions, which affect footballers' characteristics. So you will need to think twice, what tactics to choose for the next match. There will be also many small improvements like additional money rewards for getting to the next tour of Cup tournament, fame rewards for beating stronger opponent, possibility to rename your footballers.  In the next few months we are going to add modding support."

Love the way the matches play out, although I feel they're a bit too short at times. But it was pretty addictive, had the 'just one more game' feel to it.  I feel like the Tutorial could be alittle longer because I had no idea what the numbers that appear when players are in a duel meant until I saw the 'email' in the manager screen.  One thing, (i did only play the demo) but I did experience a few crashes every now and then.

footballmanagergames,3aygu6,DonSteppedOutside,4,Wed Jun 24 14:48:26 2015 UTC,I'd probably start with his crossing if you want to make him a winger. Get him tutored by one of your own wingers too.  But if he worked on his finishing a little he looks like he could be a class striker as a poacher. Looks like he could also work as a defensive forward or dlf/af (with some improvement in his passing and strength attributes).
footballmanagergames,3aygu6,OffTheBench_,3,Wed Jun 24 15:06:00 2015 UTC,He works well as a striker in a 4-4-2. He made 3 goals and 2 assists to the man that's tutoring him.  Heh: http://www.reddit.com/r/footballmanagergames/comments/3ayt6r/at_one_point_i_didnt_even_know_if_i_was_watching/
footballmanagergames,3aygu6,unfitsportsman,2,Wed Jun 24 16:18:49 2015 UTC,"Depends on your system, looks like he could be a very good inside forward cutting in from the left. The pro of doing this is that you'll improve his finishing meaning you have a good backup striker as well."

Poachers to me are like the ones with lots of pace, somewhat decent finishing ability and composure over 13. The rest can be average but they will still do the trick and Higuain does not strike me as the typical poacher player. I have never used him but just what comes to mind when it comes to Higuain as a player and his stats in game I'd probabl use him as an AF. Try that out.

footballmanagergames,3ayky8,Atrick69,6,Wed Jun 24 15:22:05 2015 UTC,"So to start I've been playing since FM 11.  However, I still feel like I have no idea what I'm doing when it comes to the transfer market. How do you guys know when you have a good player versus a decent one?  What makes a specific player good for your system? I find myself buying players that end up doing terrible and then getting shit about it from the board and fans.  Any advice?"
footballmanagergames,3ayky8,WarDemonZ,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:59:03 2015 UTC,"I guess it depends on your budget, are you in such a situation that you are wealthy enough to afford almost any player you fancy or not? I won't always go for a player just because his stats are awesome if he's just not going to fit into my team, eg I rarely play with an AMC, or ML/MRs, but that's not to say that if you find a player that has good stats you can't turn him into a player you want him to be.  It also depends on how often you're willing to change your system, do you have a player so good you're wiling to alter your team just to fit them in? or is the team shape more important.  When I'm buying players, any significant negative (aside from jumping reach/team player in the attacking roles) is an immediate red flag, I've only ever bought 1 player with a negative for consistency because he's got 19 for acc/pace/dribbling/crossing, even on a bad day, he's easily the best winger in the game.   Finally, I think you need to give some players time, don't just abandon them if they aren't working straight away, 2 of my key players sucked when I first brought them in I was about to flog them, but I'm glad I didn't."
footballmanagergames,3ayky8,bashfoc2,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:42:54 2015 UTC,Lot's of scouting first and foremost. Then for me I have a certain style I want my team to follow so I just find players that fit those molds. I find fans only tend to whinge when it's big fee players that flop so always tread especially carefully with those.  Also signing players with <6 months contract left is a brilliant way to snap up bargains! :)
footballmanagergames,3ayky8,ya_scallywag,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:45:01 2015 UTC,"As others have noted, give signings time to bed in -- not throwing them immediately into the starting lineup can be a good shout as well, give them the occasional game here and there, play them in matches that you consider to be easier ones, allow them time to get used to your system and your other players.  Also, try and find players who will work hard -- it gets a bit over-rated; however, Determination is a stat that you should definitely prioritize when looking for new players."

footballmanagergames,3ayky8,Pippadoc,8,Wed Jun 24 16:08:45 2015 UTC,"Firstly, focus on getting yourself so great coaches. You should be able to find the criteria for each coaching category through a quick google search.  After that I tend to use a Fitness coaching focus in pre-season on Heavy intensity, before switching to a Balanced focus on light during the season. In addition to that I set my players personal training focus in the role I typically play them in on a heavy intensity. For young players, I will train them in a role I expect them to play unless they have a particularly weak important stat, in that case I'll focus on that until it's been brought up.  The one alteration to that is for Goalkeepers, there Personal focus is always set to Sweeper Keeper (Support), despite not using the role, as it gives the most wide spread of stats amongst the goalkeeper roles."
footballmanagergames,3ayky8,bashfoc2,2,Wed Jun 24 16:19:23 2015 UTC,"It's not the most involved part of the game imo. Basically great coaches help (making sure they only coach 1/2 categories to keep the quality high). After that I think the most important is setting individual training, I generally review once a season and make sure everyone has a focus. The weekly team training in pre-season is fitness/team cohesion and then for the rest of the season (unless there's no games that week) it's one of the technical/tactical categories. Also don't forget to get your senior players mentoring, best mentors with best prospects and then even crap mentors might as well be assigned to crap youths just in case."

Looking at my finances I should have more than enough money to do that, and much more.  Also, should I extend weak young players just in case?

So far he has been vastly under performing in terms of his enormous price tag 6 games played and 3 more as a substitute and only 3 goals scored with 2 assists. I've been using him in a 1 striker formation as a poacher but maybe you guys have any advice for me in which kind of formation/role he would perform best in.

footballmanagergames,3ayky8,Ryukishi,2,Thu Jun 25 04:39:17 2015 UTC,I took over Napoli when Higuan was like 30. Used him as an advanced forward. Either in a 4-2-2-2 with two attacking wingers on support and a deep lying forward partner. Or I used a 4-2-3-1 with two attacking wingers on support and probably advanced playmaker. He bagged like 55 goals of which like 40 were in the league.

It will help you to get higher budgets the next year though. Budgets are calculated at the start of the year based on the clubs ambitions and financial position. Essentially the board give you and amount they think will allow them to remain financial stable.   So by spending less in a previous year you'll have some spare cash that go into the budgets for the next year, however the board may wish to retain that profit for dividends or other improvements. In that case you may just end up getting similar budgets in the following year."

footballmanagergames,3ayivw,jahartz,3,Fri Jun 26 20:44:38 2015 UTC,"Player's have two hidden values to consider when scouts or coaches evaluate them: Current Ability (CA) and Potential Ability (PA).   When you look at young players their CA will be much lower than their PA, but over time their CA will increase toward their PA (assuming they get match time and have good mental attributes). The age at which a player's CA reaches their PA varies depending on the development of the player (playing time, performance, coaching, facilities). Some players never reach their PA while some, like your player, reach theirs at a young age.   Also, just because your players CA has maxed out now does not mean their attributes will not continue to increase. Attributes take time to increase while CA can increase rapidly. The same thing also happens in the opposite direction for old players (their CA drops but their attributes take time to drop so they are still good players even after they start declining). You should always judge players based on their attributes and performance, rather than just their CA or PA as judged by your scouts or coaches."

footballmanagergames,3ay7hh,Fingot,2,Wed Jun 24 13:30:01 2015 UTC,2 CB's is great with WB's and exactly what you want to do. if you're going CWB then you want a half back like stroot to buy the CB's time to get into posision and to feed the wingbacks and create a triangle with your AMC's. Also get 2 AMC's and just go creator-scorer with them while your striker poaches to create space.

footballmanagergames,3ay7hh,Sermokala,4,Wed Jun 24 15:17:15 2015 UTC,"you want one DM not two, having inline DM's makes the passing angles ugly and sucks up too much staffing while not giveing much depth. Keep everything and Shift a midfielder forward to get a 2-3-2-2-1.   you don't need a BBM when you have a DM and an AM. a poacher in an Defensive tactic sounds cool but you'd rather have a suarez/messi style defensive forward so hes close enough to the ball for a counter."
footballmanagergames,3ay7hh,Sermokala,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:47:24 2015 UTC,Thanks. What roles should I have for my Cms and AMs?
footballmanagergames,3ay7hh,Sermokala,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:53:25 2015 UTC,"The same. Just move the DLP-S to midfield and the AP-A to attacking midfield. Poachers good then with enough hookup play and will play deep enough to bring a CB with him, or not and be really open.  The idea is that you have 3 people for their 2 CB's to now cover. Someone will be open. Also with so many people in the middle they have to go out wide and be hounded by your wingbacks in the middle of the pitch inbetween their fullbacks and forwards."
footballmanagergames,3ay7hh,unfitsportsman,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:58:32 2015 UTC,Is there a way to get wing backs to cut in between full backs and CBs and run that channel.
footballmanagergames,3ay7hh,Quinn155,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:05:19 2015 UTC,No that would be an inside forward. You still want them back far enough to recycle possession and defend. Without them on a counter you can get exposed fast.
footballmanagergames,3ay7hh,leftyboy87,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:15:12 2015 UTC,Move your dlp dm to a dlp cm
footballmanagergames,3ay7hh,bashfoc2,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:39:58 2015 UTC,What's your current tactic that's been found out?  I haven't really used wingback's this year as in my saves it's difficult to get any world class ones but in previous years I've noticed that a really good DM and preferably 2 CM's is important to keeping solid defensively.
footballmanagergames,3ay7hh,bashfoc2,2,Wed Jun 24 14:09:32 2015 UTC,http://imgur.com/olSKamE Should I take out a CM and add an extra CAM?
footballmanagergames,3avbfe,brainwrinkled,13,Tue Jun 23 20:10:25 2015 UTC,How can a guy who prefers the 4-2-4 formation be a defensive coach?
footballmanagergames,3avbfe,PhilipTheLion,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:18:55 2015 UTC,"I once did something like that. I started an Aston Villa save and kinda played counter-attack against bigger teams, had my midfielders drop deeper and my wingers play like wingers instead of inside forwards. Got decent results with it too before abandoning the save."
footballmanagergames,3avbfe,fmn13,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:16:09 2015 UTC,"And closing down. If you're defensive minded with your tactics you're probably  gonna play quite deep and won't look to close down the opposition too much. You'd probably stand off, invite the opposition on to you, and hit them on the counter. That's what I do when I'm managing a rubbish team (and when I manage Wales)."

footballmanagergames,3ax7n7,van_gaals_jawline,1 point,Wed Jun 24 09:15:02 2015 UTC,"I'm no sure what it is, his morale is good, condition is good, match fitness not so much. Can't find any other indicator. Oh well, I'll just have to wait it out two months :P"
footballmanagergames,3axpr8,fortunefading,3,Wed Jun 24 09:57:11 2015 UTC,"On the player's profile, go to the Development tab. There will be a box showing what position he is training as, change it to DM and he will begin to learn that position. It's also worth playing him as a DM whenever you get a chance."
footballmanagergames,3axpr8,StupidMastiff,0,Wed Jun 24 10:00:17 2015 UTC,"It only gives me the options to train him as either a full back, wing back, limited full back, complete wing back or inverted wing back. I am looking at this under development < training < focus which I am supposed to right? Or is it somewhere else?"
footballmanagergames,3axpr8,NumberJuanMataFan,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:12:49 2015 UTC,"Theres training focus and under it position, select DM from that menu"
footballmanagergames,3axpr8,bashfoc2,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:33:08 2015 UTC,"Play him there, train him at that position (instead of default playing position) and maybe tutor with an existing DM (not sure if it actually helps train the position or not but at least will boost relevant stats."
footballmanagergames,3awakx,BamoBeats,3,Wed Jun 24 00:41:33 2015 UTC,"If you ever find a formation where you need a BWM(s), I think he'd be brilliant. Marking's a little low but still."
footballmanagergames,3awakx,drenndak,2,Wed Jun 24 04:13:09 2015 UTC,"His First Touch, Passing, Long Shots, Decisions are too good for a Fullback. What he needs is to develop Strength. And then you can make a defensive midfielder or a Box to Box midfielder out of him. In the latter case, you'll have to develop his Attacking attributes, but that's for when he'll be a little older."
footballmanagergames,3awakx,fancyzauerkraut,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:33:06 2015 UTC,"And is crossing and dribbling a little low, if he likes his full backs to contribute in the final third."
footballmanagergames,3awakx,mono-math,2,Wed Jun 24 13:23:19 2015 UTC,Oh that 20 determination is going to carry him to crazy heights.   Do your coaches say anything about his ability in big games?
footballmanagergames,3awakx,andyff,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:25:02 2015 UTC,Just been looking. He doesn't feel comfortable playing in big matches. Knew there was a catch somewhere!
footballmanagergames,3awakx,covmatty1,3,Wed Jun 24 09:53:34 2015 UTC,"Perhaps as he gets older and matures that will improve though, could just be a consequence of him being so young at the minute."
footballmanagergames,3awakx,Telcar,2,Wed Jun 24 11:25:05 2015 UTC,"Januzaj has the same trait in my game, I haven't really noticed it at all."
footballmanagergames,3awakx,Watch_me_bounce,2,Wed Jun 24 12:31:03 2015 UTC,"I'd probs retrain to fullback if you can get his marking up.  Thats just my personal preference though as I like defensive midfielders to be very aggressive, to break up attacks"
footballmanagergames,3awakx,fancyzauerkraut,2,Wed Jun 24 03:08:16 2015 UTC,"Doesn't really matter, as you can make him play the way you want with instructions, PPMs, and the role. Anyways, he's got an amazing Determination and Work Rate so the Aggression will not hold him back.   Edit: In my opinion, the regen is too good to be retained to play the fullback. He will have much larger influence playing in midfield, all he needs is Strength. Depending how he develops, he might even become a Box to Box player, because he already has some impressive technical attributes."
footballmanagergames,3awakx,Watch_me_bounce,2,Wed Jun 24 03:16:20 2015 UTC,"Impressive DMs are a dime a dozen, fullbacks are much rarer. And yes you can change instructions but players with more aggression will get stuck into challenges more and be willing to close down attacks better."
footballmanagergames,3awakx,SynchronizedHD3,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:39:01 2015 UTC,"I agree with both points. Full backs are rarer, but I've got the big issue of filling De Rossi's role after retirement. Doesn't sound all that bad, but my team is pretty much built around him. I'm going to leave Cunha where he is and hopefully that strength will improve a bit!"
footballmanagergames,3awakx,mono-math,1 point,Wed Jun 24 09:57:46 2015 UTC,"I would retrain him as a CB, D(R) and M(R)"
footballmanagergames,3awakx,januzaj_44,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:14:46 2015 UTC,"I think his crossing and dribbling are too low to play anywhere on the flank. If he can get the marking up considerably, CB would be an option. But I think he's perfect where he is."
footballmanagergames,3awakx,januzaj_44,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:24:44 2015 UTC,"He is too short for CB, I'd try him at RB though, his dribbling and crossing will get over 10"
footballmanagergames,3awakx,Sermokala,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:00:19 2015 UTC,"CDM first because that passing could get to 19 or 20, RB/LB second.  Train him in marking though"
