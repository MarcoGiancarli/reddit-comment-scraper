In this last chapter of the Five Nights at Freddy's original story, you must once again defend yourself against Freddy Fazbear, Chica, Bonnie, Foxy, and even worse things that lurk in the shadows. Playing as a child whose role is yet unknown, you must safeguard yourself until 6am by watching the doors, as well as warding off unwanted creatures that may venture into your closet or onto the bed behind you.  You have a flashlight to protect yourself, and it will scare away things that may be creeping at the far end of the hallways. But be careful, and listen, for if something has already crept too close, then shining lights in it's eyes will be your end."

However, if you turn it on to peek outside your door, but youre too late and hes already right outside, it will trigger his jumpscare, ending the game.  Kinda how if he was outside the door in the first game, and the door was 'locked' [you couldnt press the buttons as he was already 'in the room'] his jumpscare would happen if you looked at the cameras then put it back down.

When you think about it, you only see that specific Freddy plush in one establishment: the FNaF 2 one. Now, most children would have a plush or figurine or whatever from the current time, and since we know that this child is somehow connected to Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria and that the Freddy plush we see came from the FNaF 2 pizzeria, it can be shown as supporting the fact that this game takes place in 1987. Combined with the ""Was it me?"" questions and the 87s in the source code, I would think that the either the game or some of the hidden minigames take place in 1987."

fivenightsatfreddys,3e0ah1,weaver900,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:44:30 2015 UTC,"If you're genuinely deaf, I'm just curious, how did you find the previous games? Because if I remember correctly every one had some form of audio cue that you had to listen out for or you'd die (Freddy entering the kitchen/foxy banging door in 1, animatronics entering vents and the mechanical breathing of foxy in 2, and springtrap entering the vents in 3).  EDIT: I spelled Freddy wrong. Wow."
fivenightsatfreddys,3e0ah1,BeautifulPhantom,2,Tue Jul 21 06:51:36 2015 UTC,"Oh, I have an hearing aid, so I -can- hear /some/ cues (though I need headphones to better hear them). The problem is, at least with me, is figuring out the context behind these cues. FNAF1 is the easiest, since I can differ kitchen sounds to foxy's running, but I'd hear them too late. If that makes sense. I only played fnaf1 up to...night 3, I think. Tried fnaf2, but their cues were too soft and/or too similar. Gave up because I died too many times.  After that I just stuck with watching play throughs.  Sucks not being able to understand phone guy though. That's my biggest issue with the games."

fivenightsatfreddys,3e0ah1,McRibbles,2,Tue Jul 21 08:32:24 2015 UTC,"That's pretty interesting. Since you don't hear any audio cues (Assuming you don't use a hearing aid?), I wonder. Do you find the game not as scary because of the lack of the screams and random moaning and whatnot, or scarier because of the jumpscares being even more sudden? Not sure how to really phrase it."
fivenightsatfreddys,3e0ah1,BeautifulPhantom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:53:56 2015 UTC,"I have an hearing aid, but I only could hear /some/ audio cues. FNAF1 is the easiest because I can differ them. Rest I can't (fk u vents).  Well, it depends on the games I think? FNAF2 I didn't find as scary, because I found it predictable and repetitive (probably due to sheer numbers of animatronics). I did find FNAF1 and 3 scary though, 3 more sudden.  If there's a lack of both visual cues and (not soft) audio cues (aka unexpected) OR they occurs too sudden (ex. FNAF3 phantom BB/Chica if you flips away too fast), then chances are, I'd get my shits scared out of me. That's also why I found FNAF2 the least scariest.  Does that makes sense? All deaf folks are different though, but that's how I deal with games like FNAF series. However I couldn't play FNAF1, past night 3, due to them operating mainly on audio cues. Tried FNAF2, but cues were too soft. Never did FNAF3 because of vents.  Seriously, fuck vents.  Edit: hope this answers your question? Sorry about rambling btw."
fivenightsatfreddys,3e0ah1,McRibbles,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:03:05 2015 UTC,"Not a problem! Oh, and no worries, you answered my question just fine. Thank you kindly~  I was just curious as to how another deaf person would react to a game like Fnaf. I'm not deaf myself, but I had my mother (Who, well, is.) try it out. Needless to say, I don't think she really got why I like the series.   I believe she found Fnaf 2 slightly less scary than 1 because of it being slightly easier (IMHO unless you're doing a custom night or something.) and the design of the animatronics. Them being ever so slightly more kid friendly, is all. Didn't find Springtrap scary at all and only found the Phantoms to be a bit annoying (In her words, ""Why do you have to reboot the systems? Because they scared you? What's the point?) She has, however, never played 3.  1 had about as standard of an experience you could expect. Being spooked when Foxy asked her if she wanted any of his Gran-ma ma's Cupcakes because he's a good guy. When I asked her about audio cues and such (Because she does use a hearing aid.) she only really ever talked about Balloon Boy's ""Hi!"" and most of the slightly louder Fnaf1 stuff (Animatronic jumpscares and I believe Phone guy.). Never had a peep about how 3 sounded."

fivenightsatfreddys,3e0ah1,FlamingWings,2,Tue Jul 21 01:34:15 2015 UTC,But will there be text messages?
fivenightsatfreddys,3e0ah1,Mrrobogavin,4,Tue Jul 21 01:06:49 2015 UTC,"It has no checkmark under subtitles, so probably not."
fivenightsatfreddys,3e0ah1,DreadfulSmiles,5,Tue Jul 21 02:29:59 2015 UTC,"The game takes place in the 80s, look around the room. 80s items everywhere."

fivenightsatfreddys,3e0ah1,kencrimson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:04:00 2015 UTC,"I can see this being a game that you play without any instructions. Would be a reference to the older arcade titles where you weren't given any directions; just survive and you'll be fine. Personally, I wouldn't mind that."

fivenightsatfreddys,3e0ah1,FuckboyJoe,7,Tue Jul 21 14:40:02 2015 UTC,the phone guy won't be giving instructions to a child.
fivenightsatfreddys,3e0ah1,Buzzek,3,Tue Jul 21 14:55:40 2015 UTC,"But audio isn't just a phone calls but background, jumpscare sound etc etc, right?"

fivenightsatfreddys,3e0ah1,FNaF_walrusman,3,Tue Jul 21 01:56:34 2015 UTC,you cant  because there is no full audio.
fivenightsatfreddys,3e0ah1,BlupHox,2,Tue Jul 21 03:01:16 2015 UTC,I actually laughed so badly at this
fivenightsatfreddys,3e0ah1,Cookies_x,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:47:04 2015 UTC,"Your right but this is about language, the interface will be in English. The only reason full audio would be listed is if there was spoken English words in the game. Jump scares and ambience are not language defined."
fivenightsatfreddys,3e0ah1,Buzzek,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:49:35 2015 UTC,"Hmmm... Right :I But still, I would be some way disappointed, if this game doesn't have a Phone Guy..."
fivenightsatfreddys,3e0ah1,Cookies_x,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:53:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah true I hear you, but to be fair I won't mind if it fits in with the timeline, I mean phone guy could be dead at this point, and why would he be calling a random child? It doesn't make much sense to me. Hell maybe you are phone guy  edit - Too much 'phone guy'"
fivenightsatfreddys,3e0ah1,Buzzek,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:48:25 2015 UTC,"As it's probably nightmare, It'd be easily explained as someone who you imagines. I like to prefer theory that we are playing as Pink Guy, who is a kid in his nightmare, and due to his murders he is punished, even by Phone Guy, and it'd be nice :P Also, Scott could make due to that people think, that Phone Guy is a murderer and he plays with random kid, one of victim.  And it's just my conception, there is a lot of options, what'd Scott do there (for ex. all these dad phone calls theories :P)"
fivenightsatfreddys,3e0ah1,dcx123,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:25:25 2015 UTC,What if the child we are playing as it's phone guy? Maybe?
fivenightsatfreddys,3e0ah1,FiveWalls5,2,Tue Jul 21 01:55:18 2015 UTC,What if the child we are playing as is phone guy? Maybe   FTFY
fivenightsatfreddys,3e0ah1,SlipperyThong,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:55:41 2015 UTC,"There is no Phone Guy because you ARE Phone Guy. Which I suppose would make you Phone Kid. But hey, THAT'S JUST A THEORY."

fivenightsatfreddys,3e0ah1,FiveWalls5,2,Tue Jul 21 02:29:39 2015 UTC,"What if you play as phone guy,inside phone guy,inside another phone guy?"
fivenightsatfreddys,3e0ah1,RetroGamer1985,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:17:08 2015 UTC,"You play as the son of phone guy, as a child you are tormented for the horrible sins your father comitted.  Meanwhile your Mother is dating a new guy who worked at one of the old resturants. To try and win you over he brings plush trap over for you to play with.  Also you can hear new dad guy banging your mom in her bedroom, which is directly responsible for your nightmares.  The whole game ends up being a dream and when you wake up, you've murdered both of them in your sleep."
