VAC_Porn,3ducjr,m4x3t,30,Sun Jul 19 15:41:57 2015 UTC,A cheat and a liar... that's an unusual combination.
VAC_Porn,3ducjr,Herani,12,Sun Jul 19 15:56:50 2015 UTC,"As unusual as 3rd gen unusuals in TF2  HA!    Anyway, that's common, people do this thinking Valve will read their desc's and unban them, when in reality Valve doesn't revert VAC bans."
VAC_Porn,3ducjr,dusmuvecis333,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:40:51 2015 UTC,They have reverted VAC bans in the past. There was an issue where some legitimate program caused thousands of false VAC bans and they reversed all of them.
VAC_Porn,3ducjr,PersianMG,3,Mon Jul 20 09:28:20 2015 UTC,"Also wth is KurwaSlicer 420, It was his renamed weapon?"
VAC_Porn,3ducjr,Loriael,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:51:48 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna go out on a limb and assume it was probably some sort of renamed knife, probably a high tier one like a Karambit Fade or something."
VAC_Porn,3ducjr,archaicScrivener,2,Mon Jul 20 09:14:47 2015 UTC,"It was a butterfly knife BS safari mesh, so definitely high tier! /s"
VAC_Porn,3ducjr,kaizokushinobi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:58:14 2015 UTC,"I didn't look at the inventory, I just guessed  ;~;"

VAC_Porn,3ducjr,kaizokushinobi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:54:44 2015 UTC,"No problem haha, I just felt like a dumbass XD"
VAC_Porn,3ducjr,archaicScrivener,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:43:28 2015 UTC,"Don't! By the way he acted you'd think it was a high tier knife, not one of the cheapest!"
VAC_Porn,3ducjr,kaizokushinobi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:54:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, hacking's one thing, but acting like your knife is hot shit? Gosh darn it that's against the geneva convention :["
VAC_Porn,3ducjr,archaicScrivener,14,Mon Jul 20 16:59:10 2015 UTC,"Sometimes I wonder if VAC ever gets it wrong. I'm not nearly good enough to have that happen to me but yeah, is there a chance?"
VAC_Porn,3ducjr,v_n,12,Sun Jul 19 19:27:28 2015 UTC,I think there is a slight chance because every program has its bugs. It's probably less than a 0.01% failure rate though because if there were actually a lot of legit people getting banned you would be hearing about it a lot more.
VAC_Porn,3ducjr,Goldsound,8,Sun Jul 19 19:33:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah man. The second people realised, it would be on r/all with 6000 upvites and an equal amount of comments. Just like that whole ""paid mod"" drama."
VAC_Porn,3ducjr,leithz6,9,Sun Jul 19 19:50:32 2015 UTC,What if some of these guys really are innocent. Everyone assumes they're lying.
VAC_Porn,3ducjr,Berwickmex,5,Sun Jul 19 23:20:18 2015 UTC,I still kinda wish Valve takes second look at least at on high profile players that got VACed just to be sure someone's carrier isn't fucked over by stupid error.
VAC_Porn,3ducjr,warlock1337,4,Sun Jul 19 22:46:15 2015 UTC,If someone fucked with my carrier I'd be pissed af. Ain't no one touching my little U.S.S Freedom.
VAC_Porn,3ducjr,Goldsound,3,Sun Jul 19 22:49:29 2015 UTC,"based on the wikipedia article they can execute detected code to see what it does, so they can run the wallhack a person got banned for if they want to."
VAC_Porn,3ducjr,ca1ek,3,Mon Jul 20 00:36:17 2015 UTC,That's very good then. At least they can make sure that person used real cheat not just something that looks like it to system. It'd be really sad if some pro career was ended by mistake.
VAC_Porn,3ducjr,warlock1337,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:48:52 2015 UTC,they definitely have before
VAC_Porn,3ducjr,thrnee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:38:17 2015 UTC,"@csgo_dev   2015-07-08 18:45 UTC  @itsFODDER As we stated in our email to you, the VAC system detected a cheat running on your account. Your VAC ban will not be lifted.     This message was created by a bot  [Contact creator][Source code]"
VAC_Porn,3ducjr,TweetsInCommentsBot,3,Mon Jul 20 18:38:24 2015 UTC,0.01% failure rate sounds still pretty astronomically high to me. When you consider that hundreds of thousands of people are playing the game every day. That would mean that 15-20k people would get banned by vac every year despite being innocent. I think the number is probably around 0.0005%. And a lot of those who do get banned innocently have some kind of software running that interferes with steam or cs go in some way.
VAC_Porn,3ducjr,Miller-STGT,7,Sun Jul 19 23:41:37 2015 UTC,No I am saying that 0.01% of people that get flagged by the VAC system might be false positives. Not 0.01% of the whole steam population. If there are 100K banned players then that means 10 players were banned unjustly.   I have no affiliation with Valve whatsoever though I am just speculating.
VAC_Porn,3ducjr,Goldsound,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:56:35 2015 UTC,So there are around 1500 people at max were wrongfully accused of cheating. Source
VAC_Porn,3ducjr,mirac_eren,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:03:31 2015 UTC,"Where on that page does it say that? Also I was one of the people who got falsely banned in one of those waves, and it was reverted so that was great."
VAC_Porn,3ducjr,thrnee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:35:19 2015 UTC,someone said that the rate is less than 0.01 and on the page there are estimate number of owners of cs go
VAC_Porn,3ducjr,mirac_eren,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:38:08 2015 UTC,"He mean't VAC'd players, not altogether players."
VAC_Porn,3ducjr,thrnee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:41:14 2015 UTC,can we pretend this never happened
VAC_Porn,3ducjr,mirac_eren,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:45:02 2015 UTC,yes
VAC_Porn,3ducjr,thrnee,4,Mon Jul 20 18:47:25 2015 UTC,"I doubt you guys will believe me, but one of my friends was vac banned for no reason. I don't think it was cause it was thought he was cheating cause we all kinda suck lol, but we ended up just buying him cs go on a different account lol."
VAC_Porn,3ducjr,Harv23,2,Sun Jul 19 23:59:43 2015 UTC,"Unless you are the accused cheater, no one can say for certain that their friend wasn't  cheating.   I doubt your friend would tell anyone that they loved fucking small rodents.  People tend to lie about shit they are ashamed of."
VAC_Porn,3ducjr,Madman604,2,Mon Jul 20 01:01:02 2015 UTC,"In theory, is possible. VAC use signature detection, like an antivirus, other programs can trigger that signature and lead to a wrong ban, it happened a few years ago, but is extremely rare and not likely going to happen again. And in the case that happened, it will ban a LOT of people wrongfully, not just 1 guy, so valve should be able of detect the problem and revert the bans (as they did before when this happened)"
VAC_Porn,3ducjr,mandrake88,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:53:03 2015 UTC,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_Anti-Cheat  Only 11 false positives in it's history. Due to external programs that are not cheats, or having the wrong reaction to a new game that came with the VAC, or the bugs it had when it first came out.  11 instances in over 10 years is not that bad."
VAC_Porn,3ducjr,_Affliction_,5,Wed Jul 22 02:24:40 2015 UTC,"VAC ban main account   Some kid got curious, bought a new account, hacked on it. Both accounts got banned. He doesn't want to buy a third account just yet because that's embarassing.  Instead of acting like an adult and owning it, he acts like a whiny little bitch like almost every other hacker. They really are just worse people."
VAC_Porn,3ducjr,Crownlol,3,Sun Jul 19 23:58:09 2015 UTC,Can you get a vac ban for griefing ?
VAC_Porn,3ducjr,sergeant-sherbet,9,Sun Jul 19 20:47:16 2015 UTC,No. VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) is only for cheaters.
VAC_Porn,3ducjr,NatNoBrains,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:01:12 2015 UTC,Thanks you. I was spooked.
VAC_Porn,3ducjr,sergeant-sherbet,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:45:35 2015 UTC,You can get an OW-ban for griefing though. i think it was somewhere between 6 and 18 weeks.
VAC_Porn,3ducjr,Henkersjunge,7,Tue Jul 21 11:51:11 2015 UTC,You can however be overwatch banned for griefing
VAC_Porn,3ducjr,hughkenyon,3,Sun Jul 19 23:35:13 2015 UTC,"I remember this guy. Then he kept logging into the VAC forums to cry about it, even though he was ""done with Steam""."
