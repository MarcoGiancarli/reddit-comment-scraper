FireflyFestival,3dn6xm,cybersugar,3,Fri Jul 17 17:11:19 2015 UTC,Yeah.. I'm not sure either. It's kinda why I'm not going to buy the pre-sale tickets. I've been to firefly the last 2 years and I truly enjoyed both times but I think maybe this year I might try something new
FireflyFestival,3dn6xm,longshotz38,2,Fri Jul 17 17:23:30 2015 UTC,"I did presale last year, but at $250 (plus $25 in fees) it doesn't really make it worth it to me.  You could get tickets second hand for less than that this year.  If they have them at $200 on black friday I figure I'll buy one, otherwise I'm waiting til it gets closer.  With the higher price I'd rather wait for the lineup so I can potentially choose a different festival."
FireflyFestival,3dn6xm,thefightforgood,5,Fri Jul 17 17:59:10 2015 UTC,I think. A few people would be pretty mad if they sold for 200 on black friday.  My guess is they would be the same price
FireflyFestival,3dn6xm,Derptard25,2,Fri Jul 17 20:59:17 2015 UTC,"A serious possibility, yes, but not a guarantee. I wouldn't be surprised if there was a price increase."
FireflyFestival,3dn6xm,snootchie_bootch,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:38:36 2015 UTC,"Just wait until the festival approaches, like the week of, and you'll get real cheap tickets"
FireflyFestival,3dn6xm,darksideofdagoon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:41:04 2015 UTC,In 2014 the full price tickets were $250. In 2015 they were $350. I would definitely expect them to go up. The problem with 2nd hand is they wait until the last minute to ship wristbands to the original buyer. Right before the festival. I believe a lot of people wound up at will call.
FireflyFestival,3dn6xm,clappingdog,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:28:46 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna go out on a limb and say yes, the general price tickets next year will be more expensive. I'm thinking 349$."

FireflyFestival,3de72s,kkrawz,4,Wed Jul 15 16:02:07 2015 UTC,"Sasquatch was 350 this year. Coachella is 375, Ultra's early birds 250.  Price is OK, but the money could probably be utilized a little more efficiently."
FireflyFestival,3de72s,SenorLoadenstein,5,Wed Jul 15 16:40:44 2015 UTC,"2015 Glasto: ~$250, plus camping  2015 Outside Lands: $285 early bird, $325 regular  2015 Hangout: $250  2015 ACL: $225 early bird, $250 regular  2015 Treasure Island: $150 early bird, $170 regular  2015 Life is Beautiful: $255  these are only a few that i thought of off the top of my head.  FYI: none of the price include all the stupid, crazy fees added on"
FireflyFestival,3de72s,duhud14,4,Thu Jul 16 01:03:50 2015 UTC,Glasto is Â£250...   Thats about $390... big difference...
FireflyFestival,3de72s,TheBopper00,3,Thu Jul 16 12:42:55 2015 UTC,Shaky Knees was a little over 200$ and my favorite festival I have been too so far. Osheaga cost my around 220$ and the lineup looks incredible im pumped

Roo is adequate for what you get. Firefly has blown up and, thus, they want to make money to pay huge acts. I understand all the politics between all the pricing and am not obtuse."
FireflyFestival,3de72s,Pulp_Ficti0n,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:36:41 2015 UTC,Coachella only costs 375 + like 40 for camping. No Fees on tickets. It's easily possible to pay more for firefly and I would argue you get way more at coachella.
FireflyFestival,3de72s,SenorLoadenstein,2,Fri Jul 17 03:13:46 2015 UTC,"Personally, that requires a plane flight from the Midwest, whereas I can drive to FF, Roo, Shaky Knees, etc."

FireflyFestival,3dc217,clappingdog,4,Wed Jul 15 12:21:17 2015 UTC,"Seriously it doesn't seem like VIP offers nearly the added value they charge for it at most festivals, and I would much rather be in a giant crowd than some little private viewing area off to the side anyways."
FireflyFestival,3dc217,SenorLoadenstein,2,Wed Jul 15 12:30:04 2015 UTC,Yea it looks like we're definitely doing GA. My friend somehow snuck into Super VIP last year so we thought there was free (adult) drinks but without that there's no way it's worth it.   If that buffet from 2013 was still there I'd be MUCH more inclined to get it. Spent way too much money on cheeseburgers this year
FireflyFestival,3dc217,mannequinhandandcoti,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:40:25 2015 UTC,"Yup. Unless it's Hangout Fest, where you can sit in a pool and watch the main stage."
FireflyFestival,3dc217,T1K1,3,Wed Jul 15 19:23:31 2015 UTC,"Haven't done GA but it sure was awesome being able to show up 5 minutes before a concert and be in the first couple of rows. Also I drank about 10-12 waters a day on the hot days. At $4 a piece, that's $40-48 each day. I figure I drank about $120 worth of water alone over the weekend. Take into account they are free, bottled, and there are no lines. It was so worth it."
FireflyFestival,3dc217,Pesime,0,Wed Jul 15 04:44:30 2015 UTC,I think it's two dollars a bottle. But your point still stands.
FireflyFestival,3dc217,CantThinkofAgood1,2,Wed Jul 15 16:28:58 2015 UTC,"I paid $4 but guess it depends who you were buying from. Also if you waited for the filling station, then you could get all the water you wanted for free so there is that of course..."
FireflyFestival,3dc217,TheBopper00,9,Wed Jul 15 18:54:36 2015 UTC,I'm still in line at the Pavillion stage line for water.
FireflyFestival,3d6iv8,Atmanbay,7,Mon Jul 13 22:24:50 2015 UTC,stupid how they are 250 this year instead of 200.
FireflyFestival,3d6iv8,defense87,5,Tue Jul 14 02:23:01 2015 UTC,Seriously. It only makes me wonder where the ticket price tiers are gonna start when they go on sale next year.
FireflyFestival,3d6iv8,Goran1693,5,Tue Jul 14 02:57:21 2015 UTC,and last year they had a $10 off code for those who were part of the Firefly email list or club thing. I am pretty pissed with the high starting price of tickets though
FireflyFestival,3d6iv8,CantThinkofAgood1,7,Tue Jul 14 19:35:51 2015 UTC,Honestly with how poorly it was run this year I don't think I'll be making it 4 in a row.  Lucky no one died from a heat stroke.
FireflyFestival,3d6iv8,cavemenareppl2,2,Tue Jul 14 03:41:50 2015 UTC,Do you mean with the limited water stations? or additional stuff. I did run into the limited water stations being a huge issue for me.
FireflyFestival,3d6iv8,CantThinkofAgood1,6,Tue Jul 14 19:36:25 2015 UTC,The lack of water stations was bullshit along with $4 bottles of water.
FireflyFestival,3d6iv8,JBSclater,3,Tue Jul 14 20:44:29 2015 UTC,$4 a bottle is terrible. Red Frog is a bunch of money grabbing assholes.
FireflyFestival,3d6iv8,clappingdog,3,Wed Jul 15 12:23:40 2015 UTC,Water among other things.  They completely underestimated the rain (not talking about how Kings was cancelled)  You needed jungle boots to get through the mulch patches between the fields.  They also need to not allow people to take showers at the water spigots in the camp grounds.
FireflyFestival,3d6iv8,cavemenareppl2,0,Wed Jul 15 02:02:44 2015 UTC,dude cave you talking about that girl taking a shower at the spigot after Steve...I feel your pain!
FireflyFestival,3d6iv8,aquakingman,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:38:13 2015 UTC,I agree it was run poorly. But they actually raised the ticket price by $100 this year. The highest GA price in 2014 was $250 this year it was $350.
FireflyFestival,3d6iv8,clappingdog,3,Tue Jul 14 13:03:54 2015 UTC,It's not at Event Sprout this time. It's at the Firefly website. Had to create an account. These Red Frog fuckers hate their customers.

That festival was life changing for 90% of attendees and I've attended a lot.  Get off your high horse, fist pump with some bro's instead of talking shit on them, take your shoes off and walk in the mud, have a ball in an ez up during a rain cancellation, don't spend your time looking for stupid shit to complain about on the internet later."

FireflyFestival,3d7guu,heydelinquent,2,Tue Jul 14 19:50:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's something that one can totally complain about, for the sake of complaining. Normal people understand there was nothing to be done, and even though as it all happened it was a shit show, I sure am glad i managed to get back to my camp and secure everything before the insane rain came, so ultimately i have to thank them for that."

FireflyFestival,3d7guu,heydelinquent,3,Tue Jul 14 05:29:57 2015 UTC,"Yup, and the ones to the left were easily the cleanest bathrooms in the festival too.  Definitely my primary stop, usually after cooling off in some A/C with 60min.  This guy is nuts with the prostitution ring.  I saw a couple guys walking around with tie-dyed T-shirts and no shoes, it was obviously some sort of Jim Jones-esque cult, I swear."

Oh, and this place is patrolled by dozens of police and security officers? Perfect!

FireflyFestival,3csxhh,Fatfitty,5,Fri Jul 10 14:48:28 2015 UTC,Mysteryland was at Woodstock grounds and they definitely took advantage of the hills there. The lawn in front of the 2 biggest stages were sloping hills and it was awesome cause everyone had a good view of the stage. Dancing on the hills was a little harder but I thought the clear view was worth it and everyone was still able to get down

FireflyFestival,3csxhh,MmmmBeer814,11,Fri Jul 10 16:15:10 2015 UTC,"Firefly is totally boring, visually. It's just some dirty grass, some trees with a couple of lights on them, and some signs. Even Governor's Ball does a better job of throwing neat artwork around, and utilizing its space well so it doesnt JUST look like a giant Ad campaign for all of it's sponsors.  Coachella is by far the most beautiful place I have ever been to. With perfectly manicured green grass in the desert, snow-topped mountains in the distance with palm trees all around, it really is an oasis.They also throw SO many huge, unique and thoughtful installations and artwork at you (and a ferris wheel), you probably didn't see them all while you were there.   You can really tell they put a lot of their money back into the event for us, rather than firefly, where all you saw were beer carts and security guards on the festival grounds all weekend."
FireflyFestival,3csxhh,heydelinquent,3,Fri Jul 10 15:49:50 2015 UTC,"The Bonnaroo main stage is basically an amphitheater and ALMOST everyone has a good view of the stage and act.  From what I can remember, the three tents also had sloping ground so that even at the back of the tent you could usually see a good bit of the stage."
FireflyFestival,3csxhh,Avenged9fold,3,Fri Jul 10 15:06:31 2015 UTC,"I've been to Electric Zoo, Lollapalooza, Governors Ball, Firefly, Hudson Music Project, Mysteryland, Buku, Moonrise, and Electric Forest.  As far as festival grounds goes Electric Forest wins hands down. I mean it's got a huge forest full of trippy art and lasers. Mysteryland was cool because of the hills at the stages gave everyone a good view and I mean its at Woodstock so that's pretty cool. Buku is also very cool because it's right on the river and part of it is in the warehouse where they keep the Mardi Gras floats so those are all displayed. They also have live graffiti artists painting this huge warehouse wall and then a bunch of other art scattered around. Those three fests are pretty EDM heavy (especially EF and ML, although EF has a lot of jam too) so if you're not into EDM probably not for you"
FireflyFestival,3csxhh,briguy213,2,Fri Jul 10 18:44:06 2015 UTC,"Coachella is my yearly festival. I fly there from the east coast every April because, to me, it is the most beautiful setting I have even been in for a festival.   I think FF did okay, and I think if I attend a year without all the mud, I will like it even more. I felt that Bonnaroo was too large, but I haven't been there in almost 10 years. Lollapalooza is decent, once you get used to the hike back and forth from the two big stages. I liked ACL a lot but there was a drought the year I went so it was really dry/dusty. Governor's Ball is terrible, mainly because it is too small of a space for that many people. Also getting on and off the island is a clusterfuck. I will not be going back there. Finally, Boston Calling is the worst-I can't believe they are allowed to call that a festival. It is in the middle of city hall plaza, which is basically a concrete parking lot with stairs in random places. Oh actually, honorable mention for terrible to Woodstock 99, which was at a military airbase and had 0 shade.   I still haven't been to Sasquatch, but I have a feeling I will love it. It looks beautiful in pictures."
FireflyFestival,3csxhh,lucy42,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:30:24 2015 UTC,"The landscape of Bonnaroo is very boring, it's in the middle of a very flat area, many farms etc. However, the festival grounds are beautifully decorated with artwork and sculptures at every turn. Even the campground has some nice touches at each pod. Once inside, you wouldn't realize you are in a geographically bland area."
FireflyFestival,3csxhh,casmatt99,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:54:20 2015 UTC,"Electric Forest is visually cool, but it's not as big as other fests. Roo had a lot of artwork and the like, while FF can do a lot better with its presentation."

Rothbury (now Electric Forest) takes place in a similar type of setting, but they have a fairly large forest (Sherwood Forest) that is decorated with lots of cool lighting and art installations. The landscape seems similar to Firefly, although it has a much artier feel.  Lollapalooza takes place right in Grant Park in the heart of downtown Chicago. Although I like camping festivals better (better late night scene), the location makes for a breathtaking view, as the festival is surrounded by the high-rises of the city. It's especially beautiful at night watching the headliners play surrounded by the lights of the surrounding buildings.  At least, those are the two festivals I can speak for."

FireflyFestival,3ce35q,Jahatten,-42,Tue Jul 7 14:31:02 2015 UTC,Firefly is like the slums of music festivals. Gosh I wish he would go to more festivals and choose something better. Thats gonna be a mistake and a half.
FireflyFestival,3ce35q,Pesime,10,Tue Jul 7 16:34:25 2015 UTC,That's really rude.  I really like the idea of a Firefly tattoo and I've been to other festivals. Firefly is closer to my home and I've attended it for the past 3 years with my best friends.    If the festival means something to someone why shouldn't they memorialize it with a tat?
FireflyFestival,3ce35q,ginger27,5,Tue Jul 7 16:54:39 2015 UTC,Then why are you here? Fuck off
FireflyFestival,3ce35q,yo_maaaan,-21,Tue Jul 7 17:07:45 2015 UTC,Cuz i went to firefly this year silly head

FireflyFestival,3ce35q,phillies612,2,Tue Jul 7 17:08:47 2015 UTC,My best friend and I who always go to firefly together are getting the hot air balloon too. Got an awesome picture of it this past firefly to go off of and everything.

FireflyFestival,3c8yu4,aquakingman,37,Mon Jul 6 00:37:39 2015 UTC,Chiddy Bang was probably the worst show I've ever seen from anyone.
FireflyFestival,3c8yu4,T1K1,5,Mon Jul 6 04:00:48 2015 UTC,Were the 5 hype guys deaf? They asked us to repeat everything at least 3x
FireflyFestival,3c8yu4,_shitballs_,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:31:57 2015 UTC,I saw chiddy bang the first year and they fucking killed it. I saw them again this year and I walked out after 20 minutes. Nothing's been the same since xaphoon left.
FireflyFestival,3c8yu4,MolestTheStars,-7,Thu Jul 9 17:14:32 2015 UTC,Wtf? Chiddy Bang was legit. It ended on a rough note but the hype was real.
FireflyFestival,3c8yu4,KlausFenrir,12,Mon Jul 6 05:32:21 2015 UTC,Is this a joke? I haven't met anyone that thought Chiddy Bang was good. They were the joke of the weekend.

FireflyFestival,3c8yu4,cechk02,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:49:39 2015 UTC,I forgot about them should have gave them an honorable mention as well because the Killers lucky enough picked up their slack... the band hasnt even apologized to their fans for not showing up

FireflyFestival,3c8yu4,crowelad,16,Wed Jul 8 04:15:16 2015 UTC,"I disagree with you on almost all of your comments. Just because you weren't prepared for what Morrissey was going to do doesn't mean he was bad. Anyone who knows anything about him knows he is a preachy diva, but he sounded great and is very entertaining. The Kooks played their music, and again, if you don't like their music and were only hanging out for one song then maybe you should have spent your time elsewhere. I didn't see awolnation but from what I hear your analysis is correct, I heard they were God awful. And just because you didn't like what Ryn Weaver said or how she said it doesn't mean she didn't put on a great show, she was entertaining as anything. Most of this post is you hating on bands you weren't prepared for, shouldn't have been at, or had a bad personal experience at. /rant"
FireflyFestival,3c8yu4,OhHiSpoons,5,Mon Jul 6 00:53:02 2015 UTC,Not hating on bands I just disliked their live performances. Morrissey sounded great but Firefly is a music festival where people go to get away not to watch animals get murdered and police brutality
FireflyFestival,3c8yu4,johnycake,2,Mon Jul 6 02:48:16 2015 UTC,"as someone who loves the kooks, I was disappointed with their set. Not much energy, and their live performance doesn't really sound as good as live recording. And that makes them look bad because many bands at firefly sound better live than on a CD"
FireflyFestival,3c8yu4,Ramrod66,2,Tue Jul 7 05:36:04 2015 UTC,Morrissey uses his music as a platform for his views. Same as any other artist though kinda hard to stomach him because his presentation is so graphic. If people didn't want to see that at Firefly they should have went to a different stage instead of sticking around for him and than complaining
FireflyFestival,3c8yu4,crossedsabres8,3,Wed Jul 8 04:13:19 2015 UTC,"Not a specific artist that I was disappointed with but I was really upset that I didn't hear    a horn being played all weekend.  Damn that storm, Lettuce would have got me my fix."
FireflyFestival,3c8yu4,MolestTheStars,3,Tue Jul 7 16:25:10 2015 UTC,"I liked AWOL, and the Kooks. I've seen the Kooks twice, one of those bands that if you like a lot of their songs, and they have a lot of good songs, you're gonna like their concert. AWOL I've heard mixed reviews, but the show was fine and I like their music. I didn't see Morrissey, but I heard he wasn't the best.  I would say Chiddy Bang was the most disappointing concert. Without Xaphoon they suck."
FireflyFestival,3c8yu4,lammnub,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:34:23 2015 UTC,I absolutely cannot agree with you enough about chiddy bang. I saw them live at the first firefly and they were kick-ass. I miss xaphoon bad.
FireflyFestival,3c8yu4,qvwzxsiwpz,2,Thu Jul 9 17:20:17 2015 UTC,"I've seen awolnation 3 or 4 times now and they either give a great performance or just an OK one. I was pretty bored during jungle but maybe that was just the area of the crowd I was in and the mud.  I wasn't a huge fan of kid cudi but I don't think that's a surprise for many people. I think if his set were to continue it would've turned around but the beginning seemed off.  Other than that, there wasn't a set I went to that I regretted."
FireflyFestival,3c8yu4,mki401,3,Mon Jul 6 01:16:59 2015 UTC,"I got ripped apart in another thread for saying this, but so far this thread is testament to it. Live rap, save for a few exceptional acts, is always a let down. I like Chiddy Bang's and Kid Cudi's music, but it seems as if almost everyone at Firefly hated them live. Most people were also disappointed with Snoop. What I gathered is that maybe 2 rap acts put on a decent show, and they were lower tier names. What's the lesson? Don't waste the money/space/time on big name rappers. It's nothing against them, it's just rarely enjoyable live especially in a festival setting."
FireflyFestival,3c8yu4,frazzledazle,6,Mon Jul 6 14:57:38 2015 UTC,It's pretty situational based on the artist.  Outkast was incredible.
FireflyFestival,3c8yu4,MolestTheStars,7,Tue Jul 7 16:31:14 2015 UTC,"I hope the two rap acts you're referring to are Run the Jewels and Logic, because both of them fuckin killed it. I was in the front for RTJ and that crowd had the most energy out of every show I saw all weekend. It was nuts."

He mumbled the songs and I could hardly hear him despite being pretty close to the stage. Sometimes it seemed like he wasn't saying anything at all. The only times I could clearly hear was him yelling ""yeeeeeeah"" at the end of each song."
FireflyFestival,3c8yu4,kbwildstyle,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:34:49 2015 UTC,"Those are the audio problems I was talking about, seemed like his mic was cutting off. I was super hyped for the whole thing."
FireflyFestival,3c8yu4,Ramrod66,3,Wed Jul 15 16:24:03 2015 UTC,"Not to say that they shouldn't come back because their performance was extremely on point, but I was disappointed by Walk the Moon only because their volume was turned down so low.  I was relatively close to the front and could still barely hear the singer.  Somebody done fucked up on that one."
FireflyFestival,3c8yu4,MolestTheStars,3,Mon Jul 6 20:46:06 2015 UTC,I felt the same way about the volume for Snoop.  He put on a hell of a show and you could tell he was having a blast but someone needed to crank that mic up.  Or maybe it was turned up enough but the cloud was too thick for sound to penetrate it...  WHAT THE FUCK DO WE DO?!?!?!
FireflyFestival,3c8yu4,spinlighted,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:10:47 2015 UTC,I saw them at the first firefly festival and they were excellent.  I saw them back in February and they were amazing. This time I just couldn't get into it. I ended up leaving pretty early.
FireflyFestival,3c8yu4,thatgirlfred,3,Thu Jul 9 17:17:29 2015 UTC,"Morrissey was such bullshit. What a waste of a set right before Macca. I thought the Kooks put on a great show, but there were a lot of people tripping who really needed to sit that set out. AWOLNATION was amazing though? I was really close though so maybe it was different further back."
FireflyFestival,3c8yu4,fearthyfiori,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:20:51 2015 UTC,"Knox Hamilton. I can't comment on the actual music itself, but I can say that their performance was terrible only because I was front row and the bass was turned up so loud that even with earplugs it was incredibly painful on everyone's ears in the first few rows. I've never felt bass that loud before. I don't know how to explain it but it made it hard to breath because it felt like it was choking you. That was surprising and entertaining for about 10 seconds for the first song, but it left us gasping for normal breaths in between songs. They definitely need a new sound guy."
FireflyFestival,3c8yu4,rigill,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:23:15 2015 UTC,I found that at the lawn stage the bass was always way too high. Particularly for Knox Hamilton and Panama Wedding. I was disappointed as I am a huge Knox Hamilton fan but I saw them front row the next day at their coffee house session and they were incredible. It really was just something with that stage.
FireflyFestival,3c8yu4,meowjulia,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:09:51 2015 UTC,Yeah I could not enjoy both those acts for this very reason. Disappointing because I was excited for panama wedding.

He was doing his own thing while his backup band played out of sync with him. He had no passion, no positive energy, no effort.  He was just shouting into the mic, angrily. I was very mad at the performance he put on."

FireflyFestival,3c8yu4,JonWasNotHere,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:10:27 2015 UTC,"I've seen him live in Syracuse and thought his show was absolutely incredible. It had all the three things you mentioned his Firefly show lacking. But I agree, at FF, he was horrible. I'd be willing to bet he knew he was going to get kicked off in 10 minutes and just got obliterated backstage and went out to dick around for a few minutes."
FireflyFestival,3c8yu4,razamatazzz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:26:17 2015 UTC,"Totally agree. He didn't play the last verse to Soundtrack 2 My Life (the only recognizable song in his four-song setlist to the casual fan), so that made people annoyed. He was not passionate at all, and during Mojo So Dope, it sounded like he didn't give a fuck because it was borderline mumbled with no emotion."

Still unsure if he was or not but the fact that I even have to ask that.

As a previous fan I was pretty disappointed that he literally just extended the length of his songs which he's already released. Often you'll see electronic artists mix up their songs, add in some flair while they're live, mix in other artist's songs, etc. Kygo just doubled the length of his songs and turned the bass to max. It was annoying not seeing the slightest spark of creativity from him. Plus he acted like a duche who was full of himself, most artists are greatful to be there."

FireflyFestival,3c8yu4,Goran1693,0,Thu Jul 9 16:38:46 2015 UTC,Collecting their paycheck and bailing when they didn't have another show for a week is pretty damn lame.
FireflyFestival,3c8yu4,qvwzxsiwpz,3,Thu Jul 9 23:25:06 2015 UTC,"Considering they were considered ""headliners"", it would've been pretty difficult to reschedule them around the Killers.  I was front row for KOL, believe me I was upset they got cancelled, but I understand if they had previous engagements on Sunday. They may not have had any shows until that Tuesday, but they're a popular band. They could've had interviews, signings, etc on Sunday."
FireflyFestival,3c8yu4,indiebreadkid,0,Thu Jul 9 23:50:59 2015 UTC,"I mean, a 90k person festival trumps any interviews, signings, or other engagements. Being a headliner is all the more reason to reschedule. It's not that hard. Move the killers back 45 minutes/an hour and put KOL before them. Adjust the rest of the schedule accordingly."
FireflyFestival,3c8yu4,Goran1693,-1,Fri Jul 10 01:23:35 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure I saw somewhere on this thread that they had cancelled way before the storm, they just got lucky that the storm happened to cover their asses. Big disappointment."
FireflyFestival,3c2n7f,chasebarrett123,5,Sat Jul 4 04:43:20 2015 UTC,"This is the best attempt at a lineup I've seen here, in particular the billing order. The top 2 lines are absolutely stacked however. Phoenix and Bassnectar are / havebeen both headliners at Lolla and Coachella, so if they're going to be there I'd guess they'd be top 3."
FireflyFestival,3c2n7f,crowelad,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:07:56 2015 UTC,"bassnectar never headlined either of those? if you consider headline top 3, and phoenix haven't dropped a new album in a while, so i can see them being second line. especially behind that top 4."
FireflyFestival,3c2n7f,lammnub,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:08:34 2015 UTC,"I'd agree, I feel like Bassnectar will be fine anywhere in the top 3 lines.  Phoenix is in an OK spot for those reasons.  The order towards the bottom is ridiculous though.  Rudimental that low?  Catfish and the bottlemen are huge and only getting bigger.  Caked up should be no where near where it is now.  Feed me should be top 6 lines.  A-trak is easily middle.    But your lineup needs to think ahead.  These artists with the exception of a few are all doing the festival circuit now and probably won't be next year.  Lady grouplove is pregnant and definitely will not tour for another two years."
FireflyFestival,3c2n7f,lammnub,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:16:58 2015 UTC,"you never know theres a chance they can tour without her. not that id like to see that, she's so fun live, but artists have toured with more holding them back."

FireflyFestival,3c2n7f,crowelad,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:16:24 2015 UTC,That's a shame. Feed me is pretty big and has some awesome songs. He's working under his other project now - the name is escaping me - so if he tours it'll most likely be under that nane
FireflyFestival,3c2n7f,crowelad,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:36:07 2015 UTC,I love some Bassnectar and he killed it at bonnaroo but he was listed 8th on the lineup. At Firefly I think he would be higher but not top 3.
FireflyFestival,3c2n7f,lammnub,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:49:47 2015 UTC,"Bassnectar will be headlining Lolla this year and is listed 5th on the lineup. I wouldn't want him to headline, I'm just saying it seems he is headline material now."
FireflyFestival,3c2n7f,crowelad,2,Sat Jul 4 15:03:18 2015 UTC,What do you consider headlining? Top 3 is headline. Not 5th.
FireflyFestival,3c2n7f,lammnub,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:11:01 2015 UTC,"I consider closing out one of the two headline stages at Lolla headlining. Bassnectar is playing on the same stage and time as Black Sabbath, Nine Inch Nails and Skrillex have in the last few years. Those bands (not Skrillex) would be billed as number 1 at Firefly."
FireflyFestival,3c2n7f,crowelad,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:10:35 2015 UTC,i just don't think there are any tier 1 or 2 fest that would have an edm artist in the headline slot (other then daft punk)
FireflyFestival,3c2n7f,lammnub,2,Sat Jul 4 21:42:18 2015 UTC,Deadmau5 headlined bonnaroo on friday.
FireflyFestival,3c2n7f,casmatt99,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:14:28 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. My only comment was the Bassnectar is a big deal now and is supposedly big enough to headline. It works at Lolla because they have conflicting headliner schedules,  I don't think it would make sense for unopposed headliner festivals to get him. He's too expensive for a second line position but doesn't span enough fan bases to headline unopposed. Kind of in the same category as Tiesto or Deadmau5, massive artists who wouldn't be booked by Firefly-style festivals."
FireflyFestival,3c2n7f,OhHiSpoons,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:07:03 2015 UTC,My morning jacket played at the same time as Drake at gov ball.  MMJ was definitely not a headliner.
FireflyFestival,3c2n7f,CamHartman,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:13:59 2015 UTC,"Gov ball is not comparable to Lolla's lineup, scheduling or stage setup. Lolla has legitimate headliners on 2 stages every night, it's the only US festival I in know with that kind of setup. Last year alone was Eminem vs Arctic Monkeys, Outkast vs Calvin Harris and Kings of Leon vs Skrillex."
FireflyFestival,3c2n7f,qvwzxsiwpz,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:17:25 2015 UTC,AM and Calvin Harris are not headliners yet. They're just alternative shows if you don't like the actual headliner. And that's exactly what gov ball did.

FireflyFestival,3bu9cm,razamatazzz,3,Thu Jul 2 05:04:50 2015 UTC,"After this year I've decided I'm definitely coming back with a totem. In the past 2 years I've gone from seeing almost nothing but a few signs to the extremely tall flag poles and random totems, I love them all!  I would also like to know some info on crafting one of these! What does the community like to use? Zip ties, PVC, duct tape, cardboard/posterboard? What are some of the community's inspirations for coming up with an idea for a totem?"
FireflyFestival,3bu9cm,mrgnome1538,2,Thu Jul 2 12:55:48 2015 UTC,"Do something that your whole group likes.  At Roo we photoshopped a friend's face onto a bean.  The picture was made like 3 years ago but the friend didn't find out until we posted pictures.  We used clear packing tape to tape it onto a thicker poster board.  The thing with totems is that I never know what material is actually allowed into the festival or not.  We used a pool noodle and reinforced it with a metal pole inside of it and taped up the bottom so it wouldn't fall out.  It worked out well and we only had to do minimal tape jobs throughout the festival from wear and tear.   If you're just doing flags, you can get one of those retractable flag poles and used that.  I would only suggest PVC for a campsite totem.  At FF it seemed like a lot of people forewent poles and just held the picture up instead.  It's a lot easier that way and definitely a bit cheaper."

FireflyFestival,3bo21k,saladsk,4,Wed Jul 1 00:53:36 2015 UTC,Halsey and BÃRNS were great. I have been listening to them both since they were brand new and I'm glad to see their both gaining traction.   I really enjoyed Young Rising Sons and Jungle had a great performance.
FireflyFestival,3bo21k,TheBopper00,4,Wed Jul 1 18:01:02 2015 UTC,Glass Animals was one of the best sets of the weekend.

FireflyFestival,3bo21k,jojo_mill,3,Fri Jul 3 16:55:51 2015 UTC,I couldn't believe Clean Bandit was considered a lower band to play so early in the day. They KILLED their set and we were able to get basically up to the front even after getting to the stage right when they started.
FireflyFestival,3bo21k,photogenicusername,3,Wed Jul 1 01:37:24 2015 UTC,They were definitely one of my my favorites! Great energy.

FireflyFestival,3bods3,chasebarrett123,8,Tue Jun 30 20:58:38 2015 UTC,How am I supposed to read any of this text with those colors?
FireflyFestival,3bods3,audiguy7,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:16:13 2015 UTC,"I should probably give you some constructive criticism.  First off, obviously we're going to need to change the font color or the guitar color because it's barely legible. Also I'd steer clear from making it one big gradient as it makes it look amatur-ish. If you need help finding a good color palate check out Color Lovers.  Second I would rethink the font choice. Having everything in uppercase and italics makes it a bit hard to read. You can probably get away with all caps but not caps and italics together, especially with a serif font. Check out Boston Calling and the font they used since they used all caps. You also need to add more space between the artists. A hyphen typically won't work because it looks like you're joining to words. Try a few spaces in between each band then some design element in between like a bullet or a pipe (|).  I like the design you created with the firefly and the guitar, but again, it's hard to see with the text overlayed on it. Might want to add leading to the text so we can see more of the background.  At the bottom it says 2014 for the year and 2016 up top. Also June 19-22 of 2016 would be Sunday to Wednesday.  If you have any questions let me know. I've been designing posters and logos for a while."

Why does the firefly have a guitar in its ass? Is this like a new revolutionary logo? Also, it says 2014 on the bottom. I'm pretty sure that this poster was intended for 2016. I hope you like the criticism. :-)"

FireflyFestival,3be9jg,Pulp_Ficti0n,-1,Wed Jul 1 16:48:38 2015 UTC,"He was awful at Roo, but I know he can deliver. I saw him on the Yeezus tour in winter 2013 before Roo, and it was the best show I've ever seen...still is. I was at his Roo set for about an hour, and I was like ""I'm leaving."" He had his mind made up that he was going to half-ass it, make his point, and then rock out once the haters left. So the last hour after I left, everyone said ""he killed it."" Still, I left because it was annoying for him to do that, it was a big opportunity to right what happened in 2008, and he didn't.  Clearly, he can deliver at fests.  Examples: Coachella 2010, Governor's Ball 2013, Outside Lands 2014, and more recently Glastonbury.   Since Goldenvoice is now helping Red Frog, and booked Kanye for Coachella, and that set was considered one of his greatest ever...the chances are high that he comes to Firefly and delivers a set of that magnitude vs a half-assed Roo set."

You can all sit there and say Kanye this and Kanye that, but you'd all be excited standing there at the main stage waiting for him to come on stage."

Quite the contrary.Through my experience, I've yet to go to see a live rap act that lived up to the hype. Their music sounds great through the headphones and speakers, but to me it doesn't translate to a live performance at all.   edit: IMO live rap is about the name and the hype rather than the actual performance."
FireflyFestival,3be9jg,KingJeremyTheWicked1,3,Sun Jun 28 18:59:54 2015 UTC,I might know what you mean. I'm a fan of rappers that use live backing bands. Give much more atmosphere. Even Kendrick Lamar didn't sound that great a couple years ago at Firefly just because he just rolls with his DJ.
FireflyFestival,3be9jg,qvwzxsiwpz,3,Mon Jun 29 18:45:50 2015 UTC,"you havent seen any good rap acts then.. like RTJ or Lupe Fiasco or Action Bronson or Tech N9ne or Chance the Rapper. thats like saying, ""oh all rock sets sound the same"" you cant just put a genre in a box like that"
FireflyFestival,3be9jg,KingJeremyTheWicked1,2,Sun Jun 28 23:33:48 2015 UTC,"True, but I think a list including Jay-Z, Wiz Khalifa, Kid Cudi, Big Sean, and J Cole is a pretty good sample of big names I've seen live and not enjoyed. Plus every friend of mine who went to see Kanye at the Wells Fargo Center a couple years ago said they didn't like it, and obviously they were big enough fans to pay for tickets and go see him. But hey, to each his own."

FireflyFestival,3be9jg,stirus,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:32:13 2015 UTC,"These are the stages that I think would be perfect for these acts.   Kanye West- I would love for him to close it out, but that would probably piss a lot of people off. So, I think he would open that Friday and play from 10:00pm-12:00am on Firefly stage. Radiohead- I think they would play Saturday and play 9:30pm-12:00am on Firefly. Dave Matthews Band- I think they would close out the festival, but not unopposed. Theirs a strong hate for this band, but to each his own. I think they'll put Young Thug or Schoolboy Q vs Dave Matthews Band. Bassnectar- He's too big for Pavillion, and I even think he's too big for Backyard. I think he would be on Firefly stage from 12:30-2:00am. Florence and the Machine- Pretty sure they'll play before a headliner, probably before DMB, because if she was before Kanye or Radiohead....most people would stay there and not see other acts, which isn't what Red Frog wants. Passion Pit- It would be crazy for them not to be on the main stage, so that's exactly where they are going. I'll say right before Radiohead. Death Cab for Cutie- I don't see them opening for any of the headliners, but I do see them closing like Modest Mouse. Closing Lawn Stage right before Kanye. Another insanely stacked Friday. Twenty One Pilots- Would be on the main stage but play earlier in the day. I think they would use them as a way to get people in their earlier, I'll say 3:45pm."

FireflyFestival,3bb9fn,jah304,6,Sat Jun 27 15:51:12 2015 UTC,"Like I posted in the other lineup proposal thread, Bruce Springsteen should without a doubt be invited as the main headliner. I saw him perform in Kansas City back in 2012 for his Wrecking Ball tour and that dude can really put on a show for his age. He's 65 but has the energy of a 25 year old. Dover is also only a few hours away from his old stomping grounds."
FireflyFestival,3bb9fn,zaddaj,2,Sat Jun 27 22:37:10 2015 UTC,"It seems so counter intuitive that most of the bands that play long sets(3ish hours) are all old dudes in their late 60's early 70's.  You go to a Mumford, Black Keys, Killers show and get an 1:45-2 hours.  I get that they have smaller music catalogs, but damn it just seems like old dudes rock harder.  (This statement doesn't apply for the Foo Fighters)"

FireflyFestival,3bb9fn,smarmora,15,Sat Jun 27 16:21:23 2015 UTC,why not? if you told me Paul was headlining last year i would have said the same thing
FireflyFestival,3bb9fn,ginger27,6,Sat Jun 27 19:01:44 2015 UTC,He headlined Roo the year I went.. Why not Firefly?
FireflyFestival,3bb9fn,smarmora,2,Sat Jun 27 20:33:23 2015 UTC,I'm from Asbury park he is heavily rumored to play every show here but never does. He does do random un announced shows that are amazing but whenever people start a rumor he doesn't show. I hope I am wrong though!
FireflyFestival,3bb9fn,Onlyslightlyclever,0,Sat Jun 27 22:20:52 2015 UTC,"Yep. Roo 09, Phish two shows, and Bruce who came out as a guest for an hour of one of the Phish sets as well   I hate Bruce though. His show was ""entertaining"" if you're into his stuff. At one point he ran through the crowd collecting signs of songs that people wanted to hear. He then proceeded to play all of those songs, including Santa Claus is Comin' to Town. Which again would be great. If Bruce wasn't a hack in my opinion.  I can say I've seen him. I can say I've seen him play a 12 minute jam version of Mustang Sally with Phish. But I can't say that I would want to see him at Firefly. He's just not my style of music and I don't want to have to pray that Bruce gets rained out like KoL did this year."
FireflyFestival,3bb9fn,MmmmBeer814,2,Tue Jun 30 11:35:33 2015 UTC,"Why would you pray that an artist you obviously don't care about gets rained out.  You are in the vast minority of people who think that Bruce Springsteen is a hack(It hurt just typing that), so why would you hope that the festival gets ruined for thousands of others who do love his music.  Just out of curiosity, why so much vitriol toward The Boss?"
FireflyFestival,3bb9fn,Onlyslightlyclever,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:21:10 2015 UTC,"It is my hope that I don't have to hope he gets rained out, because I hope that he isn't there in the first place. That's what I meant by that. I don't like Bruce Springsteen because I don't like his voice, his music, or his live performances. I also grew up in Philadelphia, the general area of ""The Boss"" (yes yes, I know, Long Branch, NJ) and I grew up hearing his songs on the radio ad-nauseam. I'm sorry that after almost 30 years of hearing the same tired tracks that I have grown to loathe the guy.  I've never stated that Springsteen wasn't a popular musician, I only stated that, for me he's a tired act and I'll not be even slightly disappointed if he isn't on the lineup.  I'm the same way with Tom Petty as well as Bon Jovi. These are all good artists/musicians/bands and I've seen them all perform live before finally forming my opinion, but I just can't take it anymore.  Sorry, not sorry. That's how opinions work. I'm not asking you to share my opinion, but I do appreciate you letting me clarify, even if only a little bit.  I'd much prefer Roger Waters, Elton John, Neil Young (or any of CSNY), or somehow getting Bowie out of touring retirement if we're talking legendary classic rock acts.  EDIT: someone else mentioned the Stones. Hell yes. They were like $400 tickets alone the last time they came around, I would gladly pay the price of a wristband for them"
FireflyFestival,3bb9fn,MmmmBeer814,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:11:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, so you're saying that if he is booked, you would hope his show gets rained out.  In other words, you'd rather the entire end of a day at a big music festival gets rained out so no one gets to see anything because an artist you don't care for(but millions of people love) is playing on a stage that no one is forcing you to go to.  Kinda fucked up.  I HATE Steve Aoki, but I still felt bad for the people who were looking forward to his set."
FireflyFestival,3bb9fn,johnycake,2,Tue Jun 30 19:54:18 2015 UTC,it'll happen eventually. every single year he's been rumored to headline

Call me crazy, but I really think Firefly is on the rise and Coachella is on the decline. Goldenvoice promoted Firefly more IMO, I saw a Firefly ad on several sites, and the buzz for Coachella dwindled. I mean they had AC/DC and Jack white, and Drake. Three very popular names, but I honestly believe the response for this year is saying that ""Firefly was the way to go this year.""   With a 5th anniversary next year, I expect Firefly to go big! They could go Elton John, Billy Joel, or Bruce, three acts that Coachella has never had, but from Roo response would fare well at Firefly and bring people in droves.   I'm expecting something like this.  Bruce Springsteen ,Kanye West ,Kings of Leon"

FireflyFestival,3b9jxs,razamatazzz,17,Sat Jun 27 02:24:07 2015 UTC,Phoenix is hilariously low. I don't expect them ever to be lower than Grouplove. They are second line at lowest. Also Tame Impala wouldn't be near that low at all either. They would be second tier for sure

FireflyFestival,3b9jxs,thefakemattk,2,Sat Jun 27 20:07:04 2015 UTC,I have indeed just because it is a more energetic show does not mean they should be above an EXTREMELY popular alt rock band that has headlined coachella. I would go as far as saying the epitomize the genre of alt pop
FireflyFestival,3b9jxs,yolanda_here,11,Sat Jun 27 23:28:16 2015 UTC,Would really love to see Odesza on a stage other than the Pavillion. Although using the port-a-potty during their set was probably my most intense experience from this year.

I hate him so much, but it really annoys me that people don't think he would want to come to the East Coast's burgeoning festival.  I don't want to see him at firefly, but I hate the assumption that this festival can't draw the crowds that would tempt such acts.  As an FYI, Bonnaroo 2009, when Bruce played, there were 75,000 people in attendance that year. That's LESS than the FF attendance this year!  This little fest on a race track in Delaware is quickly becoming a major summer event!"

I saw him in KC back in 2012 and that dude can really put on a show for his age. He's 65 but has the energy of a 25 year old. The festival is also only a few hours away from his old stomping grounds. Nevertheless, I like your proposed lineup, but I would love to see the Vaccines, The Strokes, Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros, Washed Out and Chet Faker on there too!"

FireflyFestival,3b5e42,beardedbear1,5,Fri Jun 26 11:43:32 2015 UTC,"The Firefly organizers didn't exactly set a great example by letting the water pump out in the parking lot expel what must have been a couple hundred gallons of water an hour all day Sunday. I told a security guard about it, but it remained unfixed all day. I thought it was pretty ironic with how difficult it was for people to get water in the actual venue.   Wish they did a better job of actually talking to people about the importance of conservation and waste. I haven't been to Bonnaroo in a couple of years, but as I recall they emphasize this."

People all scooting up in their spots didn't allow the trailer enough room so all kinds of cars and tents had to move. In the end a giant van still remained in the way with no one claiming ownership. A few of us guys decided to just pick up the trailer and swing it so it could pass the van, which ended up almost getting towed after the cops had already shown up. What a vacation.

I met this girl over the weekend at the Kid Cudi set and there was a bit of chemistry, but because it suddenly got evacuated, we got split apart. I didn't really mind it because I was pretty drunk and only spoke to her for a little bit.  The next day I go to the Steve Aoki set and zigzag into the crowd, and I fucking run into her. I was so damn excited and even got to raise her up on my shoulders (and got a picture to boot!). We had such a good time. When the set ended I asked her where she and her friends were going and she said the refill stations. I went to the bathrooms and then looked for her but she was gone.....  I'm still kinda salty about not asking for her number. I mean, I have her first name, but that's it.  :/  I hope you find him, OP!"

Maybe it was because her set was my most anticipated for the weekend and it just didn't make full sense to me. It was great don't get me wrong, but just didn't sit with me the right way. Most underrated was SNBRN, one of my favorite sets of the weekend. Kygo is everything you expect and more. Can you tell I like dance music?"

Band on the Run and Live and Let Die were some of the most unbelievable live songs I have ever seen. Hey Jude left me with tears in my eyes.  Cudi-If you really like him, go. His set was cut short by a typhoon but I liked it and I like him. Not amazing.  Gary Clark Jr.-Very cool, guitar fans be there. Like Jimi with a better voice but of course not as good guitar skills, but still great guitar skills.  Kygo-One of my favorite artists, it was awesome if you love his music, and many do. Not an impressive Dj tho he basically just plays his music.  Chainsmokers-Fun, go.  Odesza-very cool, and they actually play drums instead of sitting behind a DJ board which I liked alot.  SNBRN-Lots of fun, go.  Tove Lo-I missed them for Empire of the Sun, but heard she was great.  Wish I had seen Walk the Moon, I would recommend.  Biggest piece of advice, many acts I wanted to see were overlapping and I soon realized that being front row for someone you love is better than being in the back for one you love and one you kinda want to see."

Sturgill Simpson - Look, its country, and country isn't for everyone. But his is country 70's style. and its about drinking and drugs. I loved this set at Firefly, one of my favorite  Glass Animals - These guys really love their music, and it shows. One of the 5 best sets at Firefly.  Twin Peaks - These guys were so fun to watch... it felt like I was watching a bunch of guys, who are very familiar with themselves, and, they just want to fuck around.  Logic - I didnt see, but heard it was a FANTASTIC set.  Raury - ditto  DJ Mustard - AVOID"

Even if you aren't a huge fan, he is a must see and he plays all the fan favorites.  The Chainsmokers: I felt that they were a little underwhelming but still fun. The crowd at this show was the best part for me, although they were one of the acts that closed out the entire festival so that could be why.  Walk the Moon: Fun set that was easy to dance to! One of the highlights of my weekend.  Tove Lo: Must-see in my opinion, if only because she gets into her songs as much as the audience does. She jumps and dances around while still sounding amazing.  Cold War Kids: Unless you are a die-hard fan, I'd say this is one you could miss. They didn't have the energy I was hoping for, even during their most popular songs.  Kygo: Go and you won't regret it.  Zella Day: I really enjoyed her performance. Make sure to know a few of her songs beforehand so you can sing along. She sounds great live.  SNBRN: I didn't see SNBRN but I've heard and read that it was a great performance across the board.  Jack Novak: Kind of generic DJ but still a fun way to kick off Firefly. If you have free time during her set, then maybe check her out.    Hope this helped, have fun at Lolla!"

Radiohead is my other big wish, they aren't as mainstream as Kings or Killers, but still iconic and would definitely still move tickets. I've never seen this act, and I need to see them. Had an opportunity in 2012, but it was stripped away after the stage collapsed in Toronto, while we were in line. Still have the shirt as a reminder. If they play, then I gotta go to Firefly.  Kings of Leon still has never played Firefly, they cancelled for two separate reasons, but rain or shine....they need to play. This band gets a lot of flack, but they are good live and are perfect for the Firefly crowd.   If the top 3 was this....this would be the easiest decision for me to go.  Other acts that I would love  Tears for Fears in the Morissey slot. Let them play right before Radiohead, that would be amazing!  Kendrick Lamar opening for Kanye would be amazing, or if we were lucky he could close a sat like Cudi this year.  Grimes is an act that just pops up every once in a blue moon, but if she shows up on the lineup....oh man! What a show this would be!  James Blake- Had the chance to see him at Roo last year, and he slated it. He is undeniably one of the best producers and singer-songwriter's out there today. It would be unreal if he had a LN set, but he might get a Kygo slot. Still if he plays, this would be another act I would want at Firefly next year."

I like mine way better than any of the official ones I saw, and it's nice to lend a neighbor a hand. I loved Firefly but I've spent enough on $4 waters that I was happy to buy my shirt from a smaller guy.  On that note, I just googled ""Firefly Music Festival shirts"" and a whole bunch came up on etsy and ebay."
FireflyFestival,3b45bg,tributeaubz,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:03:25 2015 UTC,awesome thanks! I was just under the impression there was like some official store that was hiding from me or something.  Appreciated!

My shirt got pretty beat up when I took it off at the Foster the People concert and I'd love another."
FireflyFestival,3b3xqj,brandeauxn,2,Thu Jun 25 19:40:23 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't be a tracklist, but Alison Wonderland basically played the same exact set at MixMag.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIXwkduDI3w  I'm pretty sure Zedd played the same set that he played at Spring Awakening which can be found on soundcloud."
FireflyFestival,3b0z0n,thepokezenmaster,13,Thu Jun 25 02:22:53 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you. Thought the Killers sounded incredible. Gotta believe that the reason they were late was because they were perfecting ""The Bucket."" Being a huge KOL fan I was devastated that their show was rained out. Thought it was a really cool move by Flowers and co. to cover that song--especially it being one of the deeper fan favorites. Put a smile on my face for sure."
FireflyFestival,3b0z0n,Sa1ntjude,8,Thu Jun 25 04:01:29 2015 UTC,"For real. I'm not a KOL fan at all, and am a recent real fan of the killers bc of my obsessed bf, but I thought it was the sweetest thing that he played two KOL songs for the crowd. Brandon flowers is the best. Also, we went and saw him do his solo tour, and when everyone first walked in, before the other band even started to go on, he came out and said hello, thanked everyone for waiting patently, and played an acoustic of a brand new song he hadn't even released yet. It was so so real."
FireflyFestival,3b0z0n,heydelinquent,1 point,Thu Jun 25 09:53:42 2015 UTC,Loved that they picked The Bucket.  Aha Shake Heartbreak is easily my favorite Kings album.
FireflyFestival,3b0z0n,MmmmBeer814,5,Thu Jun 25 20:58:00 2015 UTC,"I really believe it was the best set of the weekend. His vocal power was incredible. My heart sank a bit when i saw the FF instagram post their setlist, and they left off Uncle Johnny, that would have exploded me into a million pieces of joy. They had so much energy, and swagger, and just love for the crowd, it was so clear how much of a show they wanted to put on. I couldn't have been happier"
FireflyFestival,3b0z0n,Prestonelliot,5,Thu Jun 25 13:18:12 2015 UTC,Killer peformance. Loved it. I hope to see them again one day
FireflyFestival,3b0z0n,mrgnome1538,3,Thu Jun 25 15:02:05 2015 UTC,best show of the weekend hands down
FireflyFestival,3b0z0n,dcaruso19,2,Thu Jun 25 14:04:04 2015 UTC,The energy of the band and the crowd was insane! They definitely were the perfect way to close out the festival
FireflyFestival,3b0z0n,TheKillers2008,7,Thu Jun 25 15:26:34 2015 UTC,"I was disappointed in the show. 30 minutes late to start with no explanation. They did not blow me away. Their show didn't have enough energy being the last big name band. You can hate me for it you can down vote me, but they were just not good.  Fanboys let the down voting start."
FireflyFestival,3b0z0n,kulak18,3,Thu Jun 25 03:14:16 2015 UTC,Yup big disappointment compared to 2012

I thought they were great, but there was no excuse for being late after all the bullshit dished out by Redfrog leading up to and during the festival. Also the KOL and weather crap which wasn't Redfrogs fault."
FireflyFestival,3b0z0n,clappingdog,-13,Thu Jun 25 19:20:31 2015 UTC,"I'm with you.    30 minutes late, and the last headliner of the weekend.  Many of the Killers' biggest fans (aka we who were in high school/college when they first got big) are working nowadays and had to work on Monday, so the delay was a slap in the face.  Mr. Brightside came on and sounded like some drunk but talented kid doing karaoke, really didn't blow me away."
FireflyFestival,3b0z0n,sillyme123,7,Thu Jun 25 03:26:31 2015 UTC,My issue was that because they started late their encore was cut by The Chainsmokers. Went to see that instead of finishing their set.

Loved that they opened with ""Mr. Brightside"" and closed with ""When You Were Young"". The crowd seemed really into it as well, even though they were late. :)"
FireflyFestival,3b0z0n,TawpWawp,0,Sat Jun 27 21:46:12 2015 UTC,"I guess since they've headlined before, they can't show up without headlining again. I think they were the weakest of the headliners... Nothing wowed me. I was more impressed by Bastille personally."

FireflyFestival,3b0e18,cechk02,5,Thu Jun 25 00:07:10 2015 UTC,"They were flying Thursday and Friday, very likely out of Dover AFB just south of FF."
FireflyFestival,3b0e18,Rtzx9r,3,Thu Jun 25 00:13:14 2015 UTC,Are you sure? They typically fly C-17s out of Dover.
FireflyFestival,3b0e18,skepticalDragon,10,Thu Jun 25 00:44:38 2015 UTC,Dover has a division of C-5's and C-17's stationed there. So it could have been either. I'm pretty sure I saw a C-5 on Thursday.

FireflyFestival,3aza2m,Rising_Moon_96,14,Wed Jun 24 18:22:32 2015 UTC,"Iâll take a stab at this one.  I think the main reason people donât want an EDM headliner is because Firefly was started as a mainly indie rock festival, which isnât that prominent anymore.  If you want EDM headliners, there are SO many options just in the general firefly area.  EDC NYC, E-zoo, Camp Bisco, and Moonrise are all fairly large and almost 100% EDM, not to mention the tons of other ones around the country.  You also said that Firefly is growing to try and be like Coachella, Roo, and Lolla, which would actually fit with the mainly non-EDM headliners.  Those festivals donât book electronic acts to headline unless they are absolute legends with a huge back catalog that have been making music/touring for a long ass time(think Chemical Brothers, Daft Punk, Radiohead).  In fact that is the same criteria they use for booking the headliners now, criteria that all three headliners this year fulfil and then some.  EDM and the people youâre championing to be headliners just havenât been big enough long enough to warrant that spot.  Skrillex just blew up in 2011, Zedd is only 25 years old, Alesso, Aoki, the Swedish house crew, all just got big within the last 5 years.  Yeah EDM is the hot sound right now, and people are going nuts for it, but that doesnât mean you just start handing out headlining spots for it.  On top of that, they essential do headline the festival.  Every night ended with at least one DJ somewhere that people can go to after the headliners.  That 12-2 slot is way more natural for a DJ than the 10:00-12 slot.  What would you do then, just have another DJ go on after them?  Then the headliner is essential an opener to a supposedly worse DJ.  Firefly made and EDM tent and has DJs closing the festival each night that is plenty.    Oh and just one comment on your reasoning behind why DJs are worthy of praise as musiciansâ¦   They will take the vocals, pick the right buildup, chord progressions, bass, drums, etc. all on the spot according to the crowds reaction.   Iâm sorry but thatâs a false statement.  Outside of performers who âDJâ using clip launching software and Ableton (Madeon, Pretty Lights, Big G, etc) kind of do that I guess, but even then they are limited to their own catalog of productions.  Any new vocals over a different track or different drop are called DJ edits or bootlegs.  Theyâre done on Ableton in a studio before the event.  All the massive visual production (lazars, confetti, lights, LED images) all synced up perfectly with the music doesnât just happen.  They plan their sets, transitions, playlist with the video engineer beforehand so it is that seamless.  Is this a bad thing? To some people like me it is, to people who just want to see a crazy light show and sing to their favorite EDM radio hits, it isnât.  Thatâs a choice you make, but trust me, the guys up there arenât doing more than hitting a sync button on the CDJs and adjusting the faders.  The earlier DJs you mentioned are indeed doing actual skilled mixing, but then they can never have the type of epic light shows people expect on the big stages.  Itâs a trade off, but thatâs how it happens."
FireflyFestival,3aza2m,MmmmBeer814,6,Wed Jun 24 19:26:43 2015 UTC,"Just something I want to add that may have no real place in the conversation:  There are live EDM acts such as Infected Mushroom, Odesza, Bloody Beetroots, Pendulum (before Knife Party), etc, etc that play instruments and sing live and it is wonderful. Not all EDM is the same, just as not all rock/metal/hardcore/country/jazz/classical/everything else is the same.  We don't need EDM headliners, but it's nice to have some big names from that side of the music spectrum to create a healthy balance."
FireflyFestival,3aza2m,GunslingerJones,5,Wed Jun 24 19:38:46 2015 UTC,"I'm seeing a huge increase in the prevalence of these live electronic groups at festivals, and it's pretty awesome.  I had a blast at Tycho, Jungle, and Clean Bandit this year and they all kinda fit into that category.  Disclosure does the whole live thing and they're huge right now.  Then you add in people like Gorgon City, SBTRKT, Todd Terje, Caribou, Jamie xx, and the ones you mentioned, it's obvious there is a lot of promising stuff coming out of that wing of the electronic spectrum. Yay diversity!"
FireflyFestival,3aza2m,MmmmBeer814,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:01:58 2015 UTC,"Was there a shortage of Indie at this years festival?  I think indie is as big and popular as ever.    Music is a constant fuckery of genres.  Electronic music just makes this even more complex as artist try to separate themselves.  How do you describe an artist like Jungle, the lines are going to just get skewed every year and next year you'll probably see more chill electronica with funky beats like Tycho & Jungle because that is the way a lot of the music scene is going (especially on the east coast)."
FireflyFestival,3aza2m,Sybertron,6,Wed Jun 24 21:14:22 2015 UTC,I think the lineup was an almost perfect balance this year. I'd like it to stay right around this style of bookings.  No need to go heavier on the EDM side.
FireflyFestival,3aza2m,MmmmBeer814,2,Wed Jun 24 21:24:49 2015 UTC,I love EDM and I agree.  This year had something for everyone and I thought it was the perfect balance of genres overall.  We don't need a lot more EDM.
FireflyFestival,3aza2m,sp0ck06,2,Thu Jun 25 05:12:33 2015 UTC,"I agree! I think Kings of Leon was the only detractor for a lot of people, feeling both a bit dated and a bit of an awkward headliner, but there were so damn many great shows and great performers."
FireflyFestival,3aza2m,Sybertron,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:33:02 2015 UTC,"I'm a big Kings fan, but I understand that criticism.  Their last album Mechanical Bull was just ok in my opinion, and they end up canceling WAY to many shows for both legitimate and non-legit reasons.  However, their first two albums are incredible.  Aha Shake heartbreak is one of my top favorite albums in general, and the documentary about them on showtime is a great watch as well."
FireflyFestival,3aza2m,MmmmBeer814,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:05:24 2015 UTC,"I don't think i sent my message across correctly, but I am not saying we should have a EDM headliner. I would just appreciate some diversity in the headliners. And you never know somewhere down the road, we may end up with one and I'd be completely okay with it. I am just trying to message across that it isn't simply a button pressing act. They have their own skill and understanding of music. And I completely agree that if anyone were to headline it'd have to be groups like Daft Punks. There are many DJ's that have preplanned set but there are many that just go with the flow as well. I disagree with the whole hitting the sync button and adjusting the faders thing, theres a lot more that goes on than that for a lot of DJs. But I will admit that there are a lot out there that do just simply that."
FireflyFestival,3aza2m,GunslingerJones,6,Thu Jun 25 17:30:25 2015 UTC,"There are actual performing artists and there are performing entertainers. Aoki at least admits he's not a true DJ.  I saw a bunch of different electronic acts this year at Firefly and some were really great. Whyel was killing it, but only occasionally interacted with his equipment. Manila Killa (or whetever his name is) literally did nothing at all, and it was pretty sad.  Filibusta was mixing live and playing keyboard live and it was awesome, I was sad to see not many people showed up because he was doing very well.  RJD2 was spinning vinyl! Hell yes! That shit was amazing until the dudes rapping came up and, in my opinion, ruined the whole set.  Also, I noticed a problem with the way Red Frog organized the Pavilion acts:  They played generic EDM playlists IN BETWEEN EDM acts! Like, what the fuck!? Because of this, people would walk by the pavilion without realizing that an actual artist was playing because they're so used to tracks being blasted on repeat 24/7 while nobody was on stage.  To stay on topic: you'll always find haters for everything, just say fuck 'em and enjoy yourself."
FireflyFestival,3aza2m,MikeV252,3,Wed Jun 24 18:41:54 2015 UTC,"I too saw RJD2. I went because I LOVE his recorded music. However I gotta say I was a little bored at the performance... Because frankly there was no performance. I respect the live mixing on vinyl, it is definitely an artform. But why couldn't there be a video feed of him mixing from a top down view the same way I get a closeup of Paul McCartneys fretboard. To me that would be interesting to watch. The turntables are his instrument and I came to see him perform... So show it to me.  I think different styles of music serve different functions. Electronic music, to me, is meant more for dancing and lives better in the studio. For that reason it doesn't translate as well into a live performance. That's not to say that DJs aren't talented. Of course there are shitty DJs that just hit play, but there's also shitty untalented musicians with gimmicks too."

Music only gains in popularity because millions of people enjoy the same tunes. I saw Sir Paul, and Aoki, and Betty Who, and Gary Clark Jr, and The Griswolds, and Kid Cudi -- all different styles and all great. Why people have to pick one or another, or have to rip on music they dislike, shows their petulance."
FireflyFestival,3aza2m,Pulp_Ficti0n,2,Wed Jun 24 20:48:58 2015 UTC,Exactly. My music taste is across all genres. Firefly did a great job of having many different kinds of acts.

FireflyFestival,3aza2m,RecklessWiener,2,Thu Jun 25 17:17:55 2015 UTC,"I'd argue that instead of trying to be like coachella or roo, firefly should have tried to go from small indie rock festival to big indie rock festival.  Whether people admit it or not, indie rock is much more popular than most people realize, and the acts in the genre draw pretty big crowds.  Besides a few general similarities between KoL and The Killers, I don't see how this years headliners were all very similar.  Paul is different from both of them, and I was unhappy with the choice of KoL to begin with, and would have preferred a better quality alt/indie rock act.  In fact, if the three headliners were split up into one each of EDM, Hip Hop, and indie rock, I can assure you that many people, myself included, wouldn't attend or even attempt to get into the headline shows for two of the three.    Other people have made this point as well, there are plenty of places for people to see EDM acts elsewhere.  If I want to see an indie rock headliner, I have a much more limited list of places to go, and I may have to travel much further.  Just let us have this place for indie rock to be the star, it doesn't have many other places.  EDM and Hip Hop take over everywhere else, and there are a large amount of people who don't care for those acts at all.  Why do we need to make firefly become like every other festival?"
FireflyFestival,3aza2m,ur2dum,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:35:16 2015 UTC,"I didn't see a single headliner for more than 15 -20 mins each. Honestly, I don't think I ever bought tickets to a festival just for the headliners and I truly preferred last years headliners much more, Outkast, Foo Fighters and Jack Johnson provided much more diversity. Regardless of there not being an EDM headliner, i still prefer the diversity every night. And frankly, there's little to no chance that Firefly will become a ""big indie rock"" festival especially after this years lineup. They're shooting for Coachella sized lineups and acts, because that's where the money is and theres nothing wrong with that."
FireflyFestival,3aza2m,GunslingerJones,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:16:43 2015 UTC,"Last year's headliners, for all intents and purposes were as diverse as this year's in my opinion.  Outkast was terrible and I left very early, foo is alternative, and jack Johnson is in the light alternative range.  The only thing wrong with last year's headliners was outkast, and that's what you claim made it more ""diverse"".  Would have been better off with the strokes or black keys or someone of the like.  More diversity in acts is just going to make firefly another big festival, when it had potential to really be special."
FireflyFestival,3aza2m,MmmmBeer814,2,Thu Jun 25 18:50:19 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, everything you said became invalid because you thought Outkast was terrible. Plus, ""another big festival"" is what makes money and is what people actually go to and that is Firefly's goal as a business."
FireflyFestival,3aza2m,hattrickptrck22,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:06:21 2015 UTC,"Well I hate to break it to you, but you're employing some pretty poor argument tactics if that's what you have to say.   I'm sorry, everything you said became invalid because you thought Outkast was terrible.   So... ""You don't like what I like, therefore your opinion is invalid.""  That's a great way to make a point.  Last year I didn't know much about Outkast, but since they were a headliner I figured I'd go into it with an open mind.  It was just ridiculous that I even stayed 15 minutes, my entire group thought it was atrocious.  There are plenty of people who weren't happy with that performance last year, whether they like the genre or not.   Plus, ""another big festival"" is what makes money and is what people actually go to and that is Firefly's goal as a business.    If you were initially making an argument for what firefly needs to do in order to maximize profit, then sure I might even support your statement.  Your initial post was about the hate towards EDM and the need to diversify the music at firefly.  I made a counter claim that firefly should at least respect the roots from which it was born.  You say that's not necessary, well consider this.  While not completely related, video game companies face many of the same issues that firefly is facing.  They make a game and want to make it as profitable as possible, but at what point can you continue to call it the same game?  A video game company must respect the dedicated player base as well as the new players they are trying to reach out to, this is exactly what firefly must do.  The dedicated base of firefly was born into an alt and indie rock festival with headliners all within that genre.  Taking these headliners away is alienating the dedicated base just to please the new base, and that's just bad business.  Just watch video games like World of Warcraft trying to battle with the scales of creating content geared toward new players versus old players and you'll see that it's not as simple as ""making the most profit""."
FireflyFestival,3aza2m,agency95,2,Fri Jun 26 05:15:51 2015 UTC,"It's common for most DJs/producers to make a ""set"" for festival season (with minor variations).  For example I saw Kygo 3 weeks prior, and it was 100% identical to his FireFly show, which was disappointing (not that the mixing he's doing is terribly difficult at all anyways).  This was my first FireFly, and I was very pleased with the EDM guys they brought in (being a more EDM guy myself).  Solidisco and Odesza were some of my favorite shows of the weekend, and I thought Steve Aoki was fucking awful(also super bummer Matoma was canceled).   I don't think EDM is in the right place to headline a festival not known for its EDM offerings anyways.  I think the current format (alt/rock headliner, then big name DJ after) is perfect.  For those wanting more EDM, keep in mind, this years FireFly was also the same weekend as EDC Las Vegas, so a ton of the big name DJs were playing there.    P.S. anyone looking to see the best electronic music has to offer, listen to Porter Robinson's Worlds."
FireflyFestival,3aza2m,mcrutch07,5,Thu Jun 25 02:20:58 2015 UTC,"As an ""older"" person, I've had this ongoing debate with my early-20's-aged son about EDM. He is a fan, I am not.  My argument has basically been this: EDM is to most contemporary genres of music what the WWE is to most professional sports. The WWE is full of entertainers (physically fit, but not necessarily athletically talented) and they're wildly popular with their fan base.  That's not to say there isn't a place for the WWE in the world of sports.  If people enjoy it, fine.  But the entertainers in the WWE are not legitimate professional athletes.  Just like the entertainers who produce EDM are not legitimate musicians.  He argues that I'm just old and I don't ""get"" it.  But I like a lot of contemporary music (hip-hop, R&B, Alternative Rock, can't STAND country) and I stand firm in my opinion that EDM is really just noise. We've basically agreed to disagree.  Neither one of us is going to change the other's mind.  I think SOME of the hate can be chalked up to generational differences."
FireflyFestival,3aza2m,MmmmBeer814,8,Wed Jun 24 19:48:52 2015 UTC,"All music is just noise.  I played guitar for 10 years thinking that electronic producers have no talent and aren't real musicians, and some actually aren't. But then I tried it myself, I've been producing for almost a year now and I've gained a massive amount of respect for those who produce their own music. Just because the live experience isn't the same, doesn't mean the art form is lost. Making the music that is played at those EDM shows can be extremely difficult and tedious, just as it is to write a great song on any other instrument, in any other genre."
FireflyFestival,3aza2m,mcrutch07,6,Wed Jun 24 20:08:06 2015 UTC,"100% this.  The real musicianship in electronic music takes place behind closed doors in a studio.  To compose an electronic song the producer has to essential function as every member of a band, a sound engineer, and a producer.  They have to know how to write drum patterns, bass lines, melodies, percussion, and then have the ability to arrange a song from those clips and then mix them down. Not all producers do this, but the good ones do.  You pretty much have to be a decent pianist, have an incredibly good grasp on music theory, and be a tech nerd to use all the gear.  I've tried producing too, and sucked ass a it, but now I also have a huge respect for those that do it well(also an ability to recognize those who don't).  The problem is that one person can't do all those things live on stage, so the way they play out, which is the only real way to make money in music anymore, is to DJ. There are a whole bunch of different levels of talent it takes to DJ, and none of them are easily witnessed from the crowd the way a lead guitarist playing a difficult solo is."

That's my problem with EDM (DJ's and Producers at least. I can get behind a band with live instruments that has electronic elements)   I go to a concert to see real musicianship, and these artists can't show it.  Its something thats not able to be ""played"" live.  It's recordings.  Granted its very difficult to create these recordings and does take a lot of musical talent to put them together, but they are sill playing music that has already been created, not music that is being created live in front of you."

On the other hand, I have a good friend who is brilliant at almost every instrument. He is amazing at the piano, guitar, drums, and saxophone. His EDM music is still terrible.

So the jobs done by those members and all other band members are taken over by the producer.  Weather or not you like the end result, it is still a difficult and complex process."

Good music has emotion and a human element that may also exist somewhere in EDM, but if it does, it certainly doesn't project it very well to the listener.  Live or recorded."
FireflyFestival,3aza2m,Jereemy0682,2,Wed Jun 24 20:39:08 2015 UTC,"We simply have different views, and I'm not trying to change yours. In my opinion, all music has a human element as it is all an outcome of the creativity of a human mind. Every song ever started as an idea in someone's head, and it was up to them to transform that idea into something tangible; the sounds that we hear. When an artist envisions a song, they choose their instruments, the medium that their ideas travel accross from thought to reality. Sometimes the instruments are guitars, and other times it's a computer processor.  All sounds are just manipulations of frequencies, from synethsizers to human vocals. All art, in my opinion, has a human element. And, by nature, it is also subjective. ;)"

There is a tiny handful leaping around on stage blaring beats and throwing cakes.  Don't judge an entire genre by its most obnoxious performers.

Knowing his dj sets from seeing him 3 times previously I told her we needed to get close and for her to really pay attention to what he was doing.  As we were walking out she said this ""I've seen many djs before but none that have ever moved that quick on that many tables with that much energy.

FireflyFestival,3aza2m,freerossi,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:37:23 2015 UTC,"People are cynical.  A lot are cynical without particularly needing to, or having much reasoning behind it.   With music you don't have all that much to be a real cynic about, an individual artist only makes an album every few years, and of those albums probably only 2 songs or so are popular.  That's less than 10 minutes of content usually, and if you go being a cynic about it; well it gets really boring to be a cynic about 10 minutes of content.    So those people attack other things, an artists album not being as good as another album, a rise of a type of music, how good a festival is about another festival is, or the quality of a concert vs another concert. All of these are horrible comparisons that make very little sense to make.    I was a musician for about 15 years, and the only thing you can do is enjoy what you enjoy and ignore the ever living fuck out everyone else that tries to tell you different.  If you had fun with the electronic artists at this years shows, GREAT.  If someone tries to say something bad about it, it's up to them to go to something different.    You'll always have friends make comments you dont agree with, it's up to you to say you just don't agree and move on.  Somehow I doubt the trend will end, and I'm sure next year will bring Maxzwell or other electronic artists back, and I'm sure the show will still sellout like crazy.  If you (or anyone) does not like that, there are any number of other options, the one advantage of music is you are never short of options.  All the more reason to never spend time or energy criticizing someone else's taste, and spend more time exploring more options."

This could be true with with any type of music but to me EDM is more about the atmosphere the DJ sets and often times they don't do enough to stand out. I'm not opposed to an EDM headliner and I don't mind having more EDM at firefly as long as other genres still play a large roll."

The thing that I think annoys people  about the EDM acts the most is the people who come just to take Molly and get fucked up while they watch the shows.  If it's what they like that's fine, but its a hard for someone who's more into the classic instrumental style of music to understand."

I was really surprised about that. We made due with some bags in my car, and were lucky to have a trash bin near our site.   I also have a feeling the age group of the majority of campers had an influence on the not caring about trash. The teenagers next to us left a ton of garbage, but my group and the others who were older all cleaned up the best they could (when all the trash bins are full and you are out of bags, you kind of just have to pile it up next to the bins eventually)."

They also left a used condom and a tampon inserter as well as a ton of other trash.  Sorry but seeing the condom alone means i wasnt picking up after them....just pointing out that there are cases where nothing can really be done"
FireflyFestival,3ayfsb,indiebreadkid,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:39:01 2015 UTC,"I mean, something could've been done in that case... you could've picked it up with a paper towel or something. I get where you're coming from but it's not like you literally could not help with the trash situation."
FireflyFestival,3ayfsb,Fruit_of_the_Shroom,2,Fri Jun 26 14:20:02 2015 UTC,"There were definitely a few campsites that I saw that were horrendous, trash everywhere. I came with just my bf and at last minute grabbed a large green garbage bag (thinking they would give out some). No one in my area was getting any free bags. My bf and I tried to keep clean and tidy up everyday. We ended up using just that one bag we brought.   As for the broken chairs/canopies I understand where that could go wrong. On our first night our tent completely flooded and fell apart. I saw that it was a very common occurrence. We had to pitch ours. Having a storm come through Saturday night probably had something to do with the broken items, maybe the garbage men didn't know whither it was trash or not so they didn't want to touch it until everyone was gone."
FireflyFestival,3ayfsb,ObsessiveDelusion,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:09:24 2015 UTC,"There were plenty of locals who made a few dollars scrapping all the metal, there were shoes and flip flops EVERYWHERE, full jugs of water, sunny d, untouched and unopened bottles of all different kinds of drinks, coolers with food left in them that had spoiled on that 90 degree day, tarps EVERYWHERE, if I would have picked all of them up, I probably would have had 30 or 40 tarps just within a 50 yard radius of where my car was parked. I think what makes it worse for red frog events is the fact that big barrel country music fest is this weekend"

One of the guys in my crew recommended that we bring a bigger vehicle to take a few of the abandoned tents and awnings with us.    Props to the locals who cleaned all that shit up, if I wasn't so poor I wanted to give every single one of you guys cleaning up a tip.  The site right behind me left their entire 10 x 30 space covered in trash, it was just thrown everywhere.  I can't believe how bad some people let their shit get."
FireflyFestival,3ayfsb,mosehalpert,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:24:33 2015 UTC,I had a group of younger kids in my aisle and when I left Monday at 12 every inch of their site was covered in layers of trash and empties. They literally must have been walking all over their trash.
FireflyFestival,3ayfsb,mrgnome1538,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:27:42 2015 UTC,"The amount of people, of all ages, that treated the sites like a big trash can really upset me as well. On Monday when everyone was clearing out I just stopped for a minute and stared at the entire premier campgrounds. The plethora of waste was jaw-dropping and saddening. I left my site clean as a whistle, neatly separated recyclables and minimal trash. I'm upset nobody else wanted to do the same."
FireflyFestival,3ayfsb,bigjince,2,Thu Jun 25 15:18:53 2015 UTC,"That was the problem, there was nothing to do with the trash! Yeah firefly had a few bins and shit around but not enough for 90k people to throw a weekends worth of camping shit away all at once. So the only option is to just leave all your trash at your site, and while it's the right thing to do to clean up and leave a single pile of trash, how easy is it to just not do that when nobody else around you is either? I mean, my campsite was left spotless, except for the giant pile of trash bags that someone had to come get, so if someone is coming around to pick up trash from my specific site anyway, why bother cleaning when they can just do it? You see the thought process of justifying leaving your site a mess? What firefly needs is some giant construction site sized dumpsters where you can just take all your trash and throw it away, and if people saw other people doing that, they would literally just go with the crowd and do it too. The grounds would be left 100x cleaner"

I was on 1831 and many of our neighbors left during the night of the evacuation and they left their shit as is. Sorry, but I wasn't going to clean up for those immature dimwits.

FireflyFestival,3ayfsb,qvwzxsiwpz,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:14:54 2015 UTC,"Just because you choose not to listen to certain artists doesn't mean half of the lineup only appealed to young people. Obviously there were a number of bands that, generally speaking, appeal to a somewhat younger crowd, however that doesn't mean it was only the kids that left trash. 3 campsites next to me had 15 people who were all 25+ and they left more trash than many of the kids around me."
FireflyFestival,3ayfsb,_Murf_,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:25:01 2015 UTC,"True. Fucking idiots were our camp neighbors and they left a massive mess on Sunday.

FireflyFestival,3ayfsb,jmo1687,-5,Thu Jun 25 17:17:33 2015 UTC,What are people supposed to do? There's so much trash you just have to pile it up at the corner of your campsite. This happens at every festival. Cleanup is built into the cost.
FireflyFestival,3ayfsb,LumaStone,11,Wed Jun 24 15:05:22 2015 UTC,"They're supposed to bring trash bags and clean up the garbage within their given lot after packing up. It's really disgusting how many people have your mentality. It takes 5 minutes to put everything into a bag and bring it to the bin. Beer cans, a football, ski pole, and random litter got it's way onto my lot and even though it wasn't mine do you know what I did? I threw it out. It's not complicated and it really reduces the aftermath if everyone pitched in for at least their own mess."
FireflyFestival,3ayfsb,sp0ck06,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:38:54 2015 UTC,"The bins are full and broken tents don't fit in bags. We piled everything in one spot, not all over the lot. It all gets cleaned up. Relax."

FireflyFestival,3ayfsb,sp0ck06,3,Wed Jun 24 15:48:02 2015 UTC,"Maybe you piled everything in one spot (by the trash cans), but if you saw pictures of the aftermath, you'd see that not everybody was good enough to do so."
FireflyFestival,3ayfsb,LumaStone,2,Wed Jun 24 15:48:36 2015 UTC,"This is what I'm mostly advocating. Aside from the broken tents and canopies, there was so much litter that could've been picked up. Maybe u/qvwzxsiwpz picked up everything on their lot but their broken tent, however op is still remarking on the many many people that didn't and how that is not okay no matter how you slice it."
FireflyFestival,3ayfsb,sp0ck06,-5,Wed Jun 24 15:56:43 2015 UTC,"It's really disgusting how many people have your mentality.   We piled all our trash in one spot and left.  I paid $150 to camp at that site, I don't think its unreasonable to expect the festival to organize cleanup."
FireflyFestival,3ayfsb,TerribleAnalogyAlert,7,Wed Jun 24 18:18:53 2015 UTC,If you go camping in any national park you have to take your own trash out and you pay probably as much.  Its about respect for the locals and esp for the environment. Its not hard to find something to put trash in and take it out.
FireflyFestival,3ayfsb,sp0ck06,-2,Wed Jun 24 18:53:18 2015 UTC,"Camping at a music festival is not the same at camping at a national park.  The Woodlands is not a protected area specifically for enjoyment of the environment, its a privately leased campground for a festival.  I get what you're trying to say, and I would NEVER leave my campsite looking like that if I was actually camping, but honestly I don't see the big deal here, they are making a shitton of money off of us and I really don't feel bad about them having to pick up trash in a huge open field."
FireflyFestival,3ayfsb,TerribleAnalogyAlert,5,Wed Jun 24 19:13:18 2015 UTC,"It is a big deal though. Itâs a big deal when a majority of 90,000 people wouldnât agree itâs their own responsibility to pick up their beer cans and floating trash because they paid too much money to be there. Thatâs not an okay mentality to have, all it does is spell entitlement, laziness, and disregard and disrespect for the land weâre shortly occupying.  The people picking up the trash aren't the ones with fat wallets and most likely than not, these organizations arenât disposing of the trash in the best ways. If I bring it, I pack it up- broken or not because I can be assured that Iâll recycle it properly.  We need to be accountable for ourselves regardless or not if we believe âthe manâ is making too much evil money off of us. I chose to pay them for my ticket and I still choose to clean up my trash. Paying to go on a vacation doesn't give anybody the right to shit all over the place."

Sublime- I was front row and the bass was insane and Rome sounds great live. Their set list was filled with jams until it got cancelled. Gary Clark - dude just ripped on the guitar it was insane. Snoop Dog - he was hilarious and everyone was having a good time. Every one smoking also helps.

Sad I missed awolnation though.  Vacationer - my surprise set of the weekend. Came in only knowing their hits but damn it was a great show. Very personal and by far best vibes of the weekend.  Cage the elephant - crazy performance! So much energy and the lead singer is one crazy fuck!!!! I loved it from the very first second.  Matt & Kim - I've seen the before and God damn I'd see them again. The crowed went crazy and so did Kim ;). Yeah it was cheesy but I had a smile on my face the whole time!

FireflyFestival,3aw5iq,Goran1693,3,Thu Jun 25 01:16:42 2015 UTC,"Mine would be   -Paul, got to see my idol, a living legend  -Mother Mother, got really into them after the lineup was announced. Also got a real close spot up at their set. They were great!  -Foster The People, crowd surfed for the first time here and ended in the third row for the rest of their set :)  -Snoop Dogg, smoked a little sum to an awesome performance. He was pretty funny too!  -Fourway tie between Matt and Kim, Awolnation, The Chainsmokers, and Steve Aoki. (Sorry, they were all just so good!)"
FireflyFestival,3aw5iq,musicandtacos,2,Wed Jun 24 00:55:12 2015 UTC,Ties are allowed and accepted. I had enough trouble limiting to 5 despite having missed Thursday and much of Friday. Jealous of your crowdsurfing!!
FireflyFestival,3aw5iq,PhillyUnion4,4,Wed Jun 24 01:24:11 2015 UTC,"No order.   Cage The Elephant: Had so much energy it was unreal. Crowd surfers and mosh pits everywhere.   Paul McCartney: Anybody who says they did not get chills when thousands of people sang Hey Jude is obviously lying,  Gary Clark Jr. : Holy shit. Just damn. This dude can shred it on the guitar.   The Killers: So much dancing and singing. The light show was incredible too. Just a fun fun show.   White Panda: Thousands of glow sticks thrown at not one, not two, but every single beat drop in the concert. Every. Single. Drop."

FireflyFestival,3aw5iq,Onlyslightlyclever,5,Wed Jun 24 03:04:47 2015 UTC,In no particular order... - Cage the Elephant - Matt & Kim - Steve Aoki - Paul McCartney - The Killers
FireflyFestival,3aw5iq,RevanDidNothingWrong,5,Wed Jun 24 03:28:29 2015 UTC,"My top 5 have to be:  1) Paul McCartney - Dude's a legend and probable vampire. I've never seen a 73 year old move with that kind of energy, sing with that kind of intensity, or make love to a crowd so sweetly as only Paul can. Also, have you ever seen Paul McCartney in the daylight? Think about it.   2) Matt & Kim - I've seen M&K three or four times now and I was telling all my camping group to go to this show because it was gonna be a fuckin PARTY. And so it was. Great music, great energy, great crowd, great performance as usual.  3) Cage the Elephant - I've also seen them perform live before, but god damn Matt was amazing. Still singing songs even as security is carrying him back to stage. Quick shout out to Nick, he's a Philly area local. Dude fuckin wails on guitar.   4) Gary Clark Jr. - I saw him a couple of years ago at the Roots Picnic. Back then I was heavy into EDM. Since then I've gotten heavily back into blues. Gary Clark can flat out wail and he pours his heart into every note. My biggest regret is missing Benjamin Booker on Sunday because I was packing up our site.  5) The Killers - What can I say? The Killers are fantastic and I've been listening to them since high school. I had never seen them perform before and they lived up to all of my expectations. The crowd was amazing, glow sticks were raining down, everyone was singing and dancing. It was great. I'm not a fan of KoL to say the least, but I totally appreciated that the band covered both of their big hits. I thought that was super classy of them considering the weather.  Honorable Mentions go to Modest Mouse, Odesza, RJD2, Snoop, the Chainsmokers (who I heard tried to play their set from their SUV in the campgrounds after they got cancelled) and Glass Animals for me."
FireflyFestival,3aw5iq,pauler94,3,Wed Jun 24 16:24:50 2015 UTC,"Sir Paul -  Goes without saying The Killers - Hot Fuss was the first record I bought and this was my first time seeing them, they surpassed my wildest dreams and the KOL covers were a cool touch. Foster the People - Vastly improved from 2013 and really brought the most out of every song they played. Skylar Spence - Great music, the lead singer had great vibes, and I got to meet with him after and chatted for a bit which was awesome.  Clean Bandit - What a great band! I honestly was just there to hear Rather Be, but they played so many great songs to dance to, and had great chemistry and energy on stage and really seemed to appreciate the crowd."
FireflyFestival,3aw5iq,pauler94,4,Wed Jun 24 00:49:20 2015 UTC,"Awesome you got to meet Skylar Spence, I had no idea what to expect with that other than knowing I loved some of his random singles that have made their way onto the net, and some of his older stuff is weird but cool. But that performance was tight, it was hard to believe that was their fourth show as a band as claimed"
FireflyFestival,3aw5iq,knightofcookies,3,Wed Jun 24 01:22:23 2015 UTC,"I was talking about this with my friend today!! He was a huge fan of Empire of the Sun and Foster the People. But my favorites are as follows:   Paul McCartney Gary Clark Jr. Run the Jewels Twin Peaks The Killers   The Killers would be after Gary but Run the Jewels was the most high energy performance of the weekend, maybe even of my whole life. Twin Peaks was pretty much the same way. They just looked like they were having so much fun on stage and I dug it. Still loved the Killers set, especially their cover of Bad Moon Rising"
FireflyFestival,3aw5iq,OhHiSpoons,3,Wed Jun 24 00:58:34 2015 UTC,"I loved that they did Bad Moon rising - was talking with someone else about it saying that I don't think they did anything very creative with it, it was basically a straight-on cover without the all-important John Fogerty vocals. But still loved that they did it. The Kings of Leon covers were great too, considering KoL's unexpected absence"
FireflyFestival,3aw5iq,ryan1046,3,Wed Jun 24 01:20:07 2015 UTC,"I didn't mind them playing a note for note cover because I love CCR and I would get sort of pissed at them if they tried to make something more out of such a simple, catchy, classic song. Regardless, it sounded great. I thought the KoL covers were a nice touch too, but I wasn't really planning on seeing Kings in the first place"

Amazing crowd as well. Andrew McMahon & the Wilderness - This was my surprise of the festival.  Didn't expect all that much from him especially him opening saturday but it was a lot of fun and just so good live. The Killers - The headliner I was looking forward to the most.  Hot Fuss is one of my favorite albums and getting to hear basically all of my favorite songs was incredible and the KOL covers were great and really nice of them to do. Matt & Kim - 2 words can describe this set.... Absolute Madness.  Now I knew M&K would be the rowdiest set of the weekend but I didn't expect it to be as crazy as it was.  Good setlist, played all the songs I love and just fuckin brought it. Modest Mouse - They were incredible live.  Really good performers, not much else to say.   Honorable mentions: Paul McCartney, SNRBN, Odesza, Kooks"

Someone's going to get sick. This money grab was really out of hand this year. But I'll be back next year. Thats how dumb l am"
FireflyFestival,3aum7q,clappingdog,10,Tue Jun 23 21:05:58 2015 UTC,Take the survey they emailed out to you and in the last section say they should get more next year. That's all.

FireflyFestival,3aum7q,fec2245,3,Wed Jun 24 00:39:24 2015 UTC,"saw same complaints about lack of water stations from people who attended last year, so not convinced they'll figure it out for next year.

FireflyFestival,3aum7q,Jtown984,4,Tue Jun 23 19:10:11 2015 UTC,"I wonder if the lines got better because people like me said fuck it, I will just buy water instead. I stopped using the refill stations on Saturday."
FireflyFestival,3aum7q,fec2245,2,Tue Jun 23 22:32:03 2015 UTC,I didn't refill Saturday or Sunday.  I just bit the bullet and paid the money.  It sucked but I didn't want to miss shows for a couple of dollars.
FireflyFestival,3aum7q,lucy42,2,Tue Jun 23 23:27:32 2015 UTC,I just came in with a filled Camelbak those days and luckily had no need to refill. Oh I did once actually but I didn't need to. The line was like 20 minutes for 10 people on Sunday night before the Chainsmokers. The water pressure was so low that it took ages for each person to fill up.
FireflyFestival,3aum7q,Jtown984,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:00:18 2015 UTC,"They made everyone dump out their bladders when I went in.  You must have gotten lucky with security, they shouldn't have let you threw."

FireflyFestival,3aum7q,av8rftw,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:44:36 2015 UTC,Sadly it's more economical to just buy $4 water. Wasting an hour of shows I payed to see is not worth saving $4
FireflyFestival,3aum7q,zacky_chan,3,Fri Jun 26 22:22:58 2015 UTC,"Yep.  Im pretty sure security felt bad for me because some how i managed to sneak in two full waters in the pockets of my basketball shorts without them noticing.   There was no way i was waiting 2 hours on a water line.  That's absurd.     If they were smart, they would make it mandatory for every food vendor to provide free tap water like the water refill stations do.  That way people aren't passing out and have access to water at any time they need it."
FireflyFestival,3aum7q,fshep,2,Wed Jun 24 12:07:20 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I'm fine drinking tap water, and I don't understand why it's so hard to get my bottle filled. Shouldn't every food vendor and drink station have a working sink? They can still sell water, and I'm sure people would still buy it, but there needs to be more done about the free water/refillable situation."
FireflyFestival,3aum7q,thunderpunchyt,2,Wed Jun 24 15:53:15 2015 UTC,"I also agree that three was too little. There was plenty of empty fence line that could have been substituted for a water station.  I was told by one of the attendants at the water station said that we should email the coordinators in mass. Maybe, they will listen for next year."
FireflyFestival,3aum7q,KlausFenrir,2,Tue Jun 23 21:15:11 2015 UTC,THEY ALSO NEED TO FIX THE SHUTTLE SYSTEM
FireflyFestival,3aum7q,mgrin88,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:00:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I also had issues with the shuttle system, and this year was the first year we did premiere camping and I felt that their Hub was sub par compared to regular camping's Hub from last year."
FireflyFestival,3aum7q,WhoahCanada,2,Wed Jun 24 17:34:44 2015 UTC,"I think it's pretty interesting since they had only 3 water refill stations despite the 90,000 people. It's almost like they're trying to tell us something. 3 water stations but only some people knew about the third Everyone knew about 2 water stations but not the third Guys it's pretty clear what Red Frog is trying to tell us.  Half-life 3 confirmed!"

FireflyFestival,3aum7q,gar187er,-22,Tue Jun 30 01:30:33 2015 UTC,"How old are you? Obviously the refill station is a concern, and they're probably going to have more next year. You don't have to 'raise hell' towards anybody.  The folks in charge of the festival will get it all figured out. Firefly is still in its infancy, so let it grow."
FireflyFestival,3aum7q,kokchain,14,Tue Jun 23 17:47:20 2015 UTC,"year 1- 2 water stations  year 2 - 2  year 3- 2  year 4- 3  Nah, I dont think they have figured it out yet"
FireflyFestival,3aum7q,gar187er,5,Tue Jun 23 19:41:24 2015 UTC,There were three last year but that sort of emphasises your point.
FireflyFestival,3aum7q,threestardot,4,Wed Jun 24 02:52:47 2015 UTC,You just got like really mad for no reason lol
FireflyFestival,3aum7q,LetThemEatCake69,2,Tue Jun 23 21:30:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've gone every year, and this is the first year that there was an ""extra"" water station. Don't think they've figured it out yet, and yes, I think raising hell  MIGHT make a difference, if nothing changes, then this probably isn't the festival for me anymore. It has nothing to do with my age, and everything to do with knowing the importance of staying hydrated, especially when the weather is in the upper 80s and I'm casually drinking.  edit, words."
FireflyFestival,3aum7q,thefightforgood,-10,Wed Jun 24 01:37:05 2015 UTC,"kinda in the past right now...  in the grounds, i went up to beer vendors a couple times and they refilled my bottle with their ice water from the coolers...."

FireflyFestival,3awrmx,Themansteve,13,Wed Jun 24 03:09:16 2015 UTC,The guy that climbed the light tower during snoop. He was like 75 feet above the ground and completely let go of the tower (using his body weight to lean into the tower so he wouldn't fall). I was too high and couldn't handle the anxiety that I had to leave snoops concert lol.  Edit: also apparently he whipped his dick around too?! Hahaha
FireflyFestival,3awrmx,PantherFan17,3,Wed Jun 24 13:46:28 2015 UTC,Lol we were all so high we just stood and stared at him

I think she may have crowd surfed and landed in that front of the stage area. As she was being ushered out back into the crowd she just went apeshit and started swinging at all the cops it was nuts."
FireflyFestival,3awrmx,kbwildstyle,5,Wed Jun 24 14:12:58 2015 UTC,"During the storm on Saturday, we were still rolling and getting fucked up well after the rain hit.  We didn't want shit to blow away, so we lowered the canopies, put on music, and just sat under those drinking and smoking.  With the canopy at head level, I couldn't see anything or hear anything over the rain.  After a while, I remembered that our neighbors (some very chill people in their late 20's from Mass.) had told us that they took a bunch of mushrooms immediately after they evacuated the festival grounds.  So I take a look at their campsite and there are about 8-10 people, guys and girls, in their underwear and covered in glowsticks, tripping balls and playing beer pong in a fucking monsoon.  We went over and talked to them for a minute, but unfortunately didn't join.  Serious respect to those guys, they know how to party."
FireflyFestival,3awrmx,benchVT,2,Wed Jun 24 17:55:10 2015 UTC,"As we where leaving Sunday night after the chainsmokers we had the windows rolled down and where playing kygo, we ended up having a dance party with like 15 people there as in traffic getting out, it was a lot of fun and one of those things that would only happen at a music festival"
FireflyFestival,3awrmx,johnnycrane,2,Wed Jun 24 14:27:36 2015 UTC,"sunday night a bunch of us were hanging out post shows.  decided to play some beer ball with the remainder of our warm beer.  game is going pretty smooth..  until halfway through.  a girl jumps on our table and starts pouring our beers on herself during her acid trip.  naturally, we try to play on, sometimes hitting her accidentally with the ball on her thigh.  she poured at least 4 beers on herself during her visit to our game.    eventually, a crowd of people come through our camping area led by a guy dressed as jake the dog pulling a cooler of beer starting a party train.  we throw our beer in the cooler and walk around the campsites.  the girl follows.  she asks for a beer from jake the dog and immediately pours it on herself to a CHOIR of boos from everyone in the party train.  she starts getting a little rowdy, but due to some peer pressure from the group, they hug it out and she vanishes.  the party train continued on."
FireflyFestival,3awrmx,Buffalone27,2,Wed Jun 24 14:29:15 2015 UTC,"After everyone got rushed out on Saturday night we went back to premier and rolled BALLLLZ in the storm to stop us from being so upset with the situation. My friend invited a security worker that worked at the premier entrance to the festival over to our camp site and he ended up being a total creep and pulled out his switchblade just for show. We had to kick him out in the storm. We then had a glow stick party and painted out faces. When the rain slowed down, we walked around premier and got a light show from a glover, met neighbors of ours from states away, and watched this guy trip so hard at the site across from us that he was singing nonsense to himself at 4am."
FireflyFestival,3awrmx,SimonAndGazorpazorp,2,Wed Jun 24 16:06:42 2015 UTC,On Sunday night me and my group of 11 people took MDMA during the Killers and came up around when they played Bad Moon Rising.  We were are rolling by the time we got to The White Panda and we split our group up cause some of us wanted to dance while others wanted to be as close as possible.  I was farther back with others to dance and halfway through the show I saw my other group of friends going nuts on the screen to the right.  We all lost it and felt like we were right there with them ya know.  Might not be crazy to you but to us it was a white pandamas miracle.
FireflyFestival,3awrmx,znb123,2,Wed Jun 24 17:00:45 2015 UTC,"Me and my friends were getting some air conditioning in the car an hour before the show started when a woman camping in front of us got between two cars and started taking of her shorts. My friend turns to us and goes ""she's about to give us a show"" (we were not ready for this kind of show) she starts putting her right hand down her panties and looks like she's digging into her ass down there. She then pulls out dirty tissue paper that was already dwelling down there!?!? We had so many questions at this pont. She inspects it and then just tosses it on the floor and pulls up her pants. At this point she looks around and stares right into our car as we are laughing in disgust. At this point I would like to think she realized the disgusting act she had committed."
FireflyFestival,3awrmx,_Murf_,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:00:59 2015 UTC,"Not my craziest story, but was definitely funny for us.  My group and I (mainly guys) all went as ""festival girls"" for the last 3 days, we put on temporary tattoos, wore ridiculous outfits, etc.  Our group was pretty vanilla, only smoked and drank.  I was wearing a pug shirt, with DREAM tattoo'd on my face, with a headband with like a moon clasp.  Compared to the previous days, the amount of people that asked me and my group if we were selling was insane.    We of course didnt have anything to sell, but made a lot of friends just by looking ridiculous, it was my first firefly and for me the ticket was worth even 1 day, let alone 4."

Definitely ranks up there with Springsteen and Elton John as one the best shows I've ever seen or will see.  Every major festival has a huge EDM star with a stage that uses enough energy to power a small city, but not every festival has a Beatle.  I did check out Marian Hill for a little after.

I got hit in the back of the head with a thick ass glow stick and dipped out.  He's talented, sure, but his set was nothing extremely special or unique. It was kind of just generic Ultra music festival style set. I listened to the whole thing even after I left halfway through.  I've been to some shows that feel like an musical adventure. Where the tempo and song choices change as the performer reads the crowd and adjusts accordingly. Zedd felt like it was just a bunch of bangers played back to back.  Not hating on those who liked it, cause he does make good music, but to me it just felt like every other mainstream EDM set."

I'm not a huge EDM person but I've been to a ton of shows, and EOTS's set on Sunday was a musical adventure - actually, more like an opera. Definitely one of the top 5 performances I've ever seen."
FireflyFestival,3aurym,bigjince,8,Tue Jun 23 20:22:42 2015 UTC,Empire of the sun was an experience. The whole show was a storyline. Very well done

FireflyFestival,3aurym,sp0ck06,5,Tue Jun 23 21:13:20 2015 UTC,EoTS was incredible. It was really more of a living art exhibition than a concert. So much fun. It was wacky and weird and perfect.

We stayed for about twenty mins of Zedd, and while fun, just didn't have the magic and surreal vibes McCartney had. Not to mention the video show during Helter Skelter was probably the most insane thing my eyes have ever witnessed."

FireflyFestival,3avaqr,SenorLoadenstein,3,Tue Jun 23 20:05:05 2015 UTC,"Most of the hotels in Dover block out Firefly weekend from their online registration systems.  It really helps to look up the local phone numbers for any hotels you're interested in.  Call and talk to the local staff. Don't try to do it online.  There are only 2 Marriott hotels in Dover: The Fairfield Inn (655 North Dupont Highway) and the Residence Inn (600 Jefferic Blvd).  Both of those are right next to camping Lot 1.  It's not that difficult to find a hotel for Firefly.  There are 25 hotels in Dover, plus Wesley College rents out their dormitories.  But you really need to call and talk to the different hotels, because they each have different policies.

FireflyFestival,3avaqr,Mar-iguana,2,Thu Jun 25 12:55:30 2015 UTC,I stayed at the marriott this festival.  Pretty sure Red Frog has the whole hotel rented out for staff as well as friends and family.

FireflyFestival,3avaqr,exitingcarisfail,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:24:01 2015 UTC,Red Frog books all hotels within about a 20 mile radius of Dover Downs. You will not be able to get a hotel any closer to that unless you're a miracle worker. I've tried every year and even talking to the hotel staff in person doesn't get you anywhere. Red Frog already paid them to keep it for their staff and vendors and everyone else working the festival

FireflyFestival,3avaqr,trainjob,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:27:50 2015 UTC,A lot of the online systems don't go as far as a full year ahead so your best bet would be to find a close hotel and call. If they don't have it in their system as an event weekend yet you could get the room cheaper.  Source: Already booked a room for next year for cheaper.
FireflyFestival,3avaqr,exitingcarisfail,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:38:46 2015 UTC,"Red Frog books all of the hotels in about a 20 mile radius of Dover Downs and you can't book them. Red Frog will put you on a hotel waiting list, but they only ever offer ones in Newark and Wilmington. It also doesn't work if you call the hotel directly. Red Frog booked the rooms, so the hotels cannot sell them to you. This is my fourth year of doing it. Look South of Dover and you have better luck. Closest that lets you book is about 20 miles. Its about a half hour drive and there's no traffic getting to the festival because you're south and most day traffic is coming from the north"
FireflyFestival,3avaqr,SteveBDel,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:01:42 2015 UTC,"That's not true.  Red Frog books rooms in a few hotels, but definitely not all of them.  I know several people who stay in Dover hotels every year.  It's hard to find rooms, but not impossible.  Here's a newspaper article from March that mentioned a couple of hotels with vacancies, and that was only 3 months before the festival: http://delaware.newszap.com/centraldelaware/138787-70/nascar-music-events-bring-smiles-to-dover-innkeepers"
FireflyFestival,3avaqr,exitingcarisfail,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:06:42 2015 UTC,They must open them up late because all in Dover are already booked and wont give you a room already for next year. And jt was the same the previous two years once the dates were released. I've found a hotel in Harrington and just say there since its outside Red Frogs zone and cheaper because its not walking distance.
FireflyFestival,3avaqr,SteveBDel,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:12:08 2015 UTC,"It's gotten harder to find hotel rooms since the festival has grown so much.  I had friends staying at the Home2 Suites in Dover this year, but that was just luck because it was a new hotel.  It's usually easier to find rooms near the air base, or at the small independent motels.  I agree that Harrington, Milford, and other small towns are good alternatives.  There were still rooms available in Harrington a couple of weeks before the festival.  And that's an easy drive."

Each set had like 3 songs, the songs seemed to be picked very arbitrarily too.    It's great that they introduced this option, but when can we pay a premium to get the full shows to watch at a later date.

FireflyFestival,3auoob,speaklouderpls,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:46:33 2015 UTC,nothing wrong with going solo
FireflyFestival,3auoob,speaklouderpls,2,Tue Jun 23 18:48:59 2015 UTC,"Yea, it's just more costly, but I might do it anyway. Or maybe I'll just buy 2 tickets at this price and hope for the best."
FireflyFestival,3auoob,mgrin88,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:21:39 2015 UTC,"I bought a presale ticket last year(they were $200) with no garuntee that anyone would go with me. But I am so glad I did, paid $100 less and ended up finding people to go with."
FireflyFestival,3auoob,JonWasNotHere,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:41:11 2015 UTC,Is this only for people who attended this year's Firefly or the public? Also do we have a time for the pre-sale going live? I work that day and hopefully can do it from my phone.
FireflyFestival,3auoob,JonWasNotHere,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:18:01 2015 UTC,"to the public i believe and it was live at noon EST last year, but took several days to sell out"
FireflyFestival,3auoob,defense87,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:51:49 2015 UTC,"Alright, thanks. I'm just worried since it's available to the public it will sell out quicker. Ugh"
FireflyFestival,3asiug,UnicornCan,11,Tue Jun 23 03:58:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah seriously what the fuck is everyone bitching about.  The only legitimate major criticism was the lack of water stations.  Other than that this year fucking killed it, best year by FAR music wise, crowds were great, good vibes everywhere, camping was fine.  The mud wasn't even bad.  I'm seeing people whining about ""mud pits"" on the grounds.... uh so what?  Its a god damn grimy music festival and you're complaining that your designer shoes from Urban Outfitters got dirty?  bah."
FireflyFestival,3asiug,sp0ck06,4,Tue Jun 23 13:59:19 2015 UTC,"Please don't forget the shuttle to and from overnight parking.  Those fucka stole 5 hours of show from and I hope the shuttle company dies in a house fire.  Fuck the Fucking stupid ass idiots who had anything to do with the Fucking shuttles.  Other than that and the water stations, 10/10 will be back next year."
FireflyFestival,3asiug,StabbyMcStaberson,2,Tue Jun 23 14:46:16 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I forgot about that bullshit.  I just said fuck it and walked the probably 3 miles.  yeah fuck those shuttles, there wasn't even any traffic.  no idea wtf was the deal with that mess."
FireflyFestival,3asiug,sp0ck06,6,Tue Jun 23 14:50:50 2015 UTC,"Ehhh, I felt that this year's lineup was the weakest, actually. Last year's was pretty damn good, and 2013 blew it out of the water."
FireflyFestival,3asiug,KlausFenrir,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:05:23 2015 UTC,"2013 was sooo good and there were technically only 2 headliners. But I think this years was awesome as well. Didn't see anyone who I didn't like. Wish it didn't storm on Saturday because I was really looking forward to KOL and Matoma, but it is what it is."
FireflyFestival,3asiug,centopercento,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:08:01 2015 UTC,Just depends on taste I guess.  I hated last years lineup.  I heard twice as many sets I enjoyed on Friday alone than I did all last year.
FireflyFestival,3asiug,sp0ck06,6,Tue Jun 23 14:08:29 2015 UTC,"Too many EDM artists that turned out to be weak or overhyped (really regret Chainsmokers lol) and not enough big modern hip hop acts (Kendrick and Chance were 2013/2014, respectively)."
FireflyFestival,3asiug,KlausFenrir,6,Tue Jun 23 14:11:04 2015 UTC,"I dunno I thought the smaller electronic acts were phenomenal.  SNBRN absolutely destroyed it.  I wasn't expecting a lot from Kygo but it was one of my favorite sets of the weekend, just perfect festival music and good vibes.  Agree about more hip hop.  They had too many trap acts in the pavilion, some good relevant hip hop in there would have been perfect."
FireflyFestival,3asiug,sp0ck06,2,Tue Jun 23 14:21:49 2015 UTC,"SNBRN was my favorite DJ set all weekend, so groovy. Glad there was one good house set to party too"
FireflyFestival,3asiug,Udelchemistry91,3,Tue Jun 23 14:30:19 2015 UTC,Yeah when he dropped Prydz On Off/Laser Beams I completely lost it.  Not a song I was expecting to hear at firefly.  I loved that stage during the day
FireflyFestival,3asiug,sp0ck06,3,Tue Jun 23 14:31:33 2015 UTC,"Agreed on that. I don't hate EDM, but I can only see so many acts before I get tired of it. They had Run the Jewels and Snoop Dogg, but RTJ isn't extremely well known and Snoop seems like a novelty almost."
FireflyFestival,3asiug,rpd123,2,Tue Jun 23 15:32:04 2015 UTC,"Oh god Chainsmokers were so bad. We only listened from afar while charging our phones and resting our feet, but on top of saying the dumbest hype up stuff, they said DC was their favorite city to play in and then were like uhh I mean even though we're not in DC... Where my DC people at?? Hahaha"
FireflyFestival,3asiug,heydelinquent,3,Tue Jun 23 16:44:18 2015 UTC,"heh it mightve sounded bad from far away but let me tell you.. underneath that tent it was going off, everyone left just giving it the last ounce of energy they had."
FireflyFestival,3asiug,sp0ck06,4,Tue Jun 23 17:53:06 2015 UTC,"It was my first ever festival and I loved it. I got stuck in the heavy rain for two miles after the shows were cancelled, my tent was flooded, my sleep was terrible, but besides all that I had the time of my life. Paul McCartney was the highlight for me. I waited 8 hours on the main stage to get close and it was so worth it. I saw CTE, whom I never heard of before, and they were amazing.   I also thought the people were cool. Really laid back and easy to converse with. No one gave me trouble. Shout out to everyone who shows positive vibes, by doing something as little as a high-five, compliment, smile, or just have a short chat."
FireflyFestival,3asiug,Horaciow14,2,Tue Jun 23 22:23:00 2015 UTC,"I got over 28 bug bites, my leg swelled up on Sunday from the pesticides in the grass and I still had the time of my life. Fuck the haters!"

FireflyFestival,3avuzd,PToexle,2,Tue Jun 23 22:32:30 2015 UTC,"There is so much to do there is no way to do it all, just be easy going and have fun, pick the shows are you need to see and the ones that you can miss, i was way more open to changing my plans this year and it led to some of the most fun stuff I did"
FireflyFestival,3avuzd,benchVT,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:55:23 2015 UTC,We went daily from around 1-2pm thru midnight. Felt we saw and did all that we wanted other than KOL.
FireflyFestival,3avuzd,Rtzx9r,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:27:41 2015 UTC,"its a music fest, you can stay home and drink all day...go experience the atmosphere, and take it all in...seems like a waste to me.  my GF and I did the spin art at Dogfish; which I thought was pretty cool."
FireflyFestival,3avuzd,gar187er,0,Tue Jun 23 23:57:26 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, sorry if I didn't elaborate but we were at our campsite and we would walk around and make new friends and people would come to our campsite. Definitely not a waste making new friends and meeting people from all over"
FireflyFestival,3avuzd,MSUlander,0,Wed Jun 24 00:21:33 2015 UTC,I think it definitely is a waste when you miss about half of the performances and the extra things like the Thicket and the Beercade. You can make friends inside the Festival as well and that way you can listen to music as well. You shouldn't miss out on the experience just because you can't be drunk for it.
FireflyFestival,3atuw3,vjdisco2,5,Tue Jun 23 13:43:11 2015 UTC,"Nope, but I heard a dude playing sexy sax man during the storm and it was glorious."

FireflyFestival,3atuw3,heydelinquent,2,Tue Jun 23 16:38:43 2015 UTC,I did. You kept me up.
FireflyFestival,3atuw3,Chelsea_1,2,Wed Jun 24 00:08:04 2015 UTC,Oh sorry about that. 11:00 PM on a Saturday night at a festival is definitely an unreasonable time to get rowdy.
FireflyFestival,3atuw3,frisomic21,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:49:36 2015 UTC,"Fireflyians flocked from far and wide, seeking shelter and good tunes to carry them through the epic storms.   Festival Gods will always punish you for strumming the tune known as Wonderwall. Festival Gods please forgive us."

FireflyFestival,3ascqu,youastar,3,Tue Jun 23 11:57:22 2015 UTC,Second.  Took me 6 1/2
FireflyFestival,3ascqu,Derptard25,2,Tue Jun 23 12:51:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah took me 5:40 and that was in the middle of the night, right after killers. This doesn't check out at all"
FireflyFestival,3ascqu,SylvesterLundgren,2,Tue Jun 23 15:11:28 2015 UTC,It was 3pm. We tried to make it back in time for my friend to work but he ended up feeling too shitty to make it so we slept for a few hours in Connecticut where we had to switch cars

FireflyFestival,3ascqu,BigRed3071,2,Tue Jun 23 03:59:00 2015 UTC,"Hell yeah, our group had a blast despite having our tents flood"
FireflyFestival,3as5f9,JGreben,5,Tue Jun 23 01:58:59 2015 UTC,Tycho was incredible. Exactly what I expected
FireflyFestival,3as5f9,algar32,3,Tue Jun 23 03:35:50 2015 UTC,"The more I think about it, the more I think that they played the best set at the festival, their performance was flawless, their backdrop videos were some of the best, and THAT DRUMMER. Good for fucking him man, that shit was close to impossible."
FireflyFestival,3as5f9,SylvesterLundgren,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:22:10 2015 UTC,Tycho's drummer was my favorite part of that performance. Easily in my top 5 sets of the weekend.
FireflyFestival,3as5f9,youastar,1 point,Tue Jun 23 11:59:38 2015 UTC,"This was who I was looking forward to most. I just don't think they have a huge following. They're getting there. But yeah, they were exactly what I was hoping. Amazing performance."
FireflyFestival,3as5f9,MaresDoOrgasm,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:57:18 2015 UTC,Absolutely agree. They were completely mesmerizing.
FireflyFestival,3as5f9,theclimaxan,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:48:15 2015 UTC,"Left X-Ambassadors early, because they weren't good, and then went to Tycho for the last 40 min or so..woahhhh Mama what a show! Gonna seek out more electronic live acts like this vs EDM."
FireflyFestival,3as5f9,eclecticmusicdude89,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:20:38 2015 UTC,"Highlight of the festival for me, especially since it was kind of small in terms of the crowd. I was the guy in the back field spinning lights all night. God, that evening was magical."
FireflyFestival,3as5f9,B4SSF4C3,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:34:00 2015 UTC,Tycho normally is one dude: Scott Hansen. Aka photographer iso50. But to do a live show he has a band. I followed my friends to some other show at Roo while he was on and I've been kicking myself since because I fucking love Tycho. I hope they play a good show at bisco.
FireflyFestival,3as5f9,fancyclancy95,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:59:09 2015 UTC,"Bet you felt rough after Roo than Firefly 1 week later. I did it two years ago. My body hated me, but I had an amazing time. Hope you enjoy Bisco on the mountain!"
FireflyFestival,3as5f9,jcohle,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:01:34 2015 UTC,I missed firefly this year sadly to try bonnaroo out. My buddies did both last year and they were beat afterwards. I don't regret roo I just wish I could've done both but I'm kinda poor so roo and bisco is a lot. Plus I wanna do farm fest here in New Jersey in late July. But thanks and I will enjoy bisco.
FireflyFestival,3as5f9,fancyclancy95,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:41:04 2015 UTC,"That show was absolutely my favorite of Thursday and definitely in the top 5 of the weekend. The sound, the visuals, and their music were all on point!"
FireflyFestival,3as5f9,jmo1687,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:30:19 2015 UTC,"Absolutely fantastic performance. I wasn't expecting him to have a full band backing him up, but it worked flawlessly. The visuals were on point too! A lot of these other electronic bands should take a note from Tycho and hire him to do their visuals. I'm talking to you Kygo!"
FireflyFestival,3as5f9,bigjince,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:18:19 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I think the main dude used to be in the photography industry which explains the originality of their pictures/vids in the background."
FireflyFestival,3as5f9,mariweenie,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:18:58 2015 UTC,"Tycho definitely had one of the best and most underrated performances of the festival. It was my favorite set that night and I absolutely love The Kooks so, for me, that's saying a lot.   Odesza and Kygo killed too and they didn't get much recognition either. After Kygo, I heard way more people talking about the pyrotechnics than the music."
FireflyFestival,3as5f9,babyvade,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:26:52 2015 UTC,"I left the Kooks early, went to the water station next to the Pavillion and was captivated by Tycho. I regret not seeing their entire set. After I got water I just stood there and watched til the end."
FireflyFestival,3askkg,Buffalone27,3,Tue Jun 23 04:14:16 2015 UTC,How amazing was zedd? I was rolling too and I lost my shit for the drop in the Zelda song and sang my heart out for clarity and want you to know.

FireflyFestival,3ar0gr,Tourettes_at_best,24,Mon Jun 22 20:24:53 2015 UTC,"Had another great weekend at firefly as well.  Way too many haters on the internet, you would think all these people didn't just party and listen to great music for 4 days straight."
FireflyFestival,3ar0gr,wincow16,8,Mon Jun 22 21:50:41 2015 UTC,"I think the majority of the things that people are complaining about are 2 major things.   the water situation, which is ridiculous by anyones standards. 3 water stations?? for 90,000 people...you cant be serious. I think this is the biggest and most noticeable thing that FF could easily fix, but they havent fixed it for 4 years.  The weather. Which is unavoidable. Not FF fault   I had a great time, it was my third year in a row. I think I am going to Bonaroo next year, interested to see how it compares!"
FireflyFestival,3ar0gr,mgrin88,2,Tue Jun 23 00:36:18 2015 UTC,Yea the water stations were definitely fucked

FireflyFestival,3ar0gr,Onlyslightlyclever,2,Tue Jun 23 12:20:22 2015 UTC,"i wasn't there this year but it really does seem like only those complaining on the interwebs are the ones who didn't like it,"
FireflyFestival,3ar0gr,delicious_grownups,6,Tue Jun 23 00:26:59 2015 UTC,I had a ton of fun and still have some complaints. Honestly I just think all the problems firefly has boils down to it being a newer festival and red frog still learning how to correctly run it.
FireflyFestival,3ar0gr,rigill,3,Tue Jun 23 00:58:56 2015 UTC,I enjoyed myself but I don't think the evac on Saturday night is getting enough attention.  Not to be over dramatic but shit could have hit the fan really quick that night.
FireflyFestival,3ar0gr,threestardot,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:55:55 2015 UTC,i called my firefly peeps as soon as I heard and luckily they were all just doin' drugs in a car somewhere
FireflyFestival,3ar0gr,delicious_grownups,2,Tue Jun 23 02:51:56 2015 UTC,Sounds about right.
FireflyFestival,3ar0gr,rpd123,3,Tue Jun 23 15:12:12 2015 UTC,"i think the ability to say that you still had fun makes a difference. I've heard people say some really disparaging shit for no reason. I think it's reasonable to say ""well, you could do this a little better next year"" without being accused of whining or complaining. That's more like, giving advice. Does that make sense? Saying they didn't have enough water stations isn't complaining, it's a fact. Saying that the festival is too ""bro-ey"" or that the people suck or that you didn't get to see KoL and want  your money back, that's complaining."
FireflyFestival,3ar0gr,delicious_grownups,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:51:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, exactly.  SO many people are complaining about the ""Vibe"" of the crowd this year, and trash and this and that, but I have noticed the same exact things all three years I've attended.  That doesn't make people littering and all that right or anything but I'm not gonna let it ruin my weekend and bitch and complain about it.  Anytime you have a gathering of 90,000 people there is guaranteed to be a percentage of douchers, but all-in-all I feel like the majority of the crowd and attendees were there for a good time and to listen to good tunes like every other year."
FireflyFestival,3ar0gr,wincow16,2,Tue Jun 23 14:15:01 2015 UTC,"I don't know where these pockets of ""bro folken"" even are. I've yet to really meet anyone who truly fits that description"
FireflyFestival,3ar0gr,delicious_grownups,2,Tue Jun 23 15:04:38 2015 UTC,"Haha yea same.  I have to say though, there was somebody there who was a friend of a friend that I know who Is quite the roided out meat head, and I saw him one day in the fest wearing a speedo and just jacked out of his mind, so he kind of fits the description, but regardless he's still not a bad dude and I doubt he got in the way of anybody having a good time,"
FireflyFestival,3ar0gr,wincow16,2,Tue Jun 23 15:37:32 2015 UTC,"yeah i mean, doesn't it seem a little judgmental anyway to label someone a bro and then hate on them for that without knowing them? i personally don't really think the fest is bro laden. it's mostly just dudes and girls, who are young and like to drink and take drugs while listening to music.   even if there was a bro, it's like, isn't that a prejudice to dislike them for their dress or appearance? i know we all hate bro-ism or whatever, but it seems like a cop out to say that everyone there is a bro"
FireflyFestival,3ar0gr,delicious_grownups,3,Tue Jun 23 16:12:47 2015 UTC,Not to be a dick but why would people complain that did like it?  I enjoyed myself but there were definitely some issues.  The mud issue could have been controlled with sand/hay.  The water stations were just plain silly.  Still enjoyed myself though.
FireflyFestival,3ar0gr,threestardot,2,Tue Jun 23 01:52:07 2015 UTC,"honestly, i would barely call that complaining. You just expressed to me a legitimate gripe that is cause for improvement. And, you admit that you still enjoyed yourself. that, to me, makes a huge difference."
FireflyFestival,3ar0gr,delicious_grownups,12,Tue Jun 23 02:42:03 2015 UTC,Care to elaborate on the almost kidnapping?!
FireflyFestival,3ar0gr,coeurbattant,7,Tue Jun 23 00:06:28 2015 UTC,Couldn't agree with you more. See you next year!
FireflyFestival,3ar0gr,funkymustache,6,Mon Jun 22 21:38:00 2015 UTC,"I had so much fun too! Wish i could've met up with other redditors this time, but I guess I was too busy enjoying the experience for the first time. I'll definitely make the effort next time I go!"

Maybe pauls music isnt what youre into but seeing paul was so much more than that, the man is a living legend and youll probably never get another chance to see anything like that where youll more than likely have another chance to see zedd. With all that said i respect your decision because its all preference and im happy you had a hell of a time"

FireflyFestival,3arxe8,xbutcherx,7,Tue Jun 23 03:48:28 2015 UTC,**Walk the Mud
FireflyFestival,3arxe8,shandpj,6,Tue Jun 23 13:18:36 2015 UTC,"Glad to hear your friend is alright! That happened a few times in shows I was at. Always people there to help out. Maybe if there were more water stations installed like LAST YEAR, this stuff wouldn't be a problem."
FireflyFestival,3arxe8,Goran1693,3,Tue Jun 23 01:32:14 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! He was fine for the rest of the weekend, and luckily, my group of thirteen had no mishaps after that, for the rest of the weekend. I came close to passing out a couple of times throughout the weekend but I was lucky enough to narrowly escape total dehydration by getting to the front of the water stations before it happened. There was one guy who worked at the water station next to the Pavilion stage that I went to Friday night and I told him how I needed to drink water before I passed out and he forced me to drink from my liter water bottle after filling it up and then refilled it again. He was unbelievably nice about it, probably my favorite volunteer at the whole festival. I really hope they have more water stations next year, cutting down on them is probably the most evil thing a festival runner could do."
FireflyFestival,3arxe8,Goran1693,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:50:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah I can relate. What makes even less sense is in addition to taking away 3+ stations this year, they forced everyone to empty out their camelbaks at the festival entrance AND THEN force people who don't want to wait in line to pay 5 bucks for a bottle of water. Fuck that shit, what a waste of the water they already purchased for the refill stations. It just seems like their goal for the weekend was for is to completely hate them, which almost happened to me if it wasn't for the bands. I nearly passed out waiting an hour and a half for water while I was tripping hard on acid. I'm not one to fool around with dehydration so that definitely annoyed me, especially with how hot it was Friday. Ugh I digress lol."
FireflyFestival,3arxe8,cavemenareppl2,4,Tue Jun 23 03:54:41 2015 UTC,If they had more than two water stations like last year it probably wouldn't have happened.  They had more people and less water than last year.    There should be a DCA complaint about how hard it was to get water in the grounds.
FireflyFestival,3arxe8,heydelinquent,3,Tue Jun 23 03:07:38 2015 UTC,"They had three, but that's still absolutely inexcusable."
FireflyFestival,3arxe8,cavemenareppl2,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:56:35 2015 UTC,I heard there was a secret one in the beercade or something.

FireflyFestival,3arxe8,gobbleturkey,3,Fri Jun 26 02:58:47 2015 UTC,This is how it should be. Glad he was alright! I was at a charging station late sunday/monday morning and a car got stuck in the mud. A random dude and I at the charging station pushed her out in shin deep mud. It's great to see others help those in need especially when away from their normal environment.
FireflyFestival,3arxe8,zpaceman,3,Tue Jun 23 01:17:56 2015 UTC,No way! My girlfriend was the one who bent down and turned him on his side while he was passed out! And she then came back over and recommended he get a Gatorade. Glad to hear that he is okay!! Haha she's gonna be pumped when I tell her this
FireflyFestival,3arxe8,MySweetThreeDog,2,Tue Jun 23 04:04:59 2015 UTC,"Whoa, I wasn't expecting this! Tell your girlfriend that my friends and I are extremely thankful that she was so helpful"

FireflyFestival,3arxe8,ashlynanarchy,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:13:37 2015 UTC,"Friday I went back to premier with two friends, we filled up two gallons of water and several water bottles. The lines were SO bad and we could already see so many people suffering without water at 3pm, so I got back to the gates and argued about bringing my water jugs in for about five minutes before a higher up let me through saying she doesn't need anyone dying in there tonight. I just kept repeating, '3 water stations, 90 thousand people.' And they let me in. We passed out all of our water bottles to people in trouble and filled others' with one of our jugs, saving the other for us throughout the night. People were so desperate and thankful, but it mostly just made me so angry this situation ever happened in the first place. You can really see where Firefly's priorities lay."
FireflyFestival,3aqw2m,TawpWawp,47,Mon Jun 22 19:53:26 2015 UTC,At least the Killers were nice enough to play some Kings of Leon songs
FireflyFestival,3aqw2m,Colonelcool125,15,Mon Jun 22 20:19:18 2015 UTC,The killers proabably sounded better playing them than the kings of Leon would have been but honestly I talked to around 100 random people on Sunday asking what their thoughts were on them not rescheduling and I think maybe one or two people said they were disappointed. I for one wasn't sad about it at all.   Once they rescheduled Steve and chainsmokers i was fine with what happened (becides kudi)  Who gets in a mood and goes... I think I want to jam to some kings of Leon anyways
FireflyFestival,3aqw2m,a_not_clever_name,8,Mon Jun 22 21:28:09 2015 UTC,"yeaa only show I was dissapointed about was cudi, he was just about to kick into all his jams and they cut it.   That being said it did suck that kings got rained out but I can't say i'm necessarily upset I didn't get to see them, it just kinda sucked to have to go back to the campsite at 10 pm and sit in a car rolling for 2 hours."
FireflyFestival,3aqw2m,wincow16,3,Mon Jun 22 21:55:57 2015 UTC,I heard Cudi sounded horrible and everyone was glad he was cut short because it sounded like he was literally whining into the mic.
FireflyFestival,3aqw2m,The_Iron_Zeppelin,6,Mon Jun 22 23:58:12 2015 UTC,To each his own but I was definitely feeling cudi and thought his set sounded good
FireflyFestival,3aqw2m,wincow16,3,Tue Jun 23 00:15:41 2015 UTC,Cudi was hype for sure
FireflyFestival,3aqw2m,Pulp_Ficti0n,3,Tue Jun 23 03:01:26 2015 UTC,Cudi was a little off I'll admit but it was still really disappointing to get cut off when it was getting hype.

FireflyFestival,3aqw2m,JoeAdkins,2,Tue Jun 23 00:23:47 2015 UTC,Dude looked energetic and spoke cohesively from where I was watching.  But ok
FireflyFestival,3aqw2m,supafuz,3,Tue Jun 23 00:27:32 2015 UTC,"Fair enough.  I didn't get a chance to see him myself, but multiple people at camp were complaining about it.  I actually enjoy his music, so I'll give him the benefit of the doubt."
FireflyFestival,3aqw2m,The_Iron_Zeppelin,5,Tue Jun 23 00:28:32 2015 UTC,I think as a headliner they were very anticipated and I can say my entire group was excited and very disappointed that they were cancelled. just because you talked to 100 out of 90k doesnt mean they were not wanted in the woodlands. you're just being an ass
FireflyFestival,3aqw2m,KingJeremyTheWicked1,19,Mon Jun 22 22:41:33 2015 UTC,"After they cancelled Saturday I was fairly confident they would perform early Sunday (being as their equipment was left set up on stage.) But apparently I was too generous in thinking they care about us who were waiting to see them. If this were last year and the Foo's set had to be cancelled, we would have seen Dave out there the next day with an even longer set. Makes you think about what KOL's real motivation is now."
FireflyFestival,3aqw2m,The_Iron_Zeppelin,8,Mon Jun 22 19:54:02 2015 UTC,Exactly!  There were even roomers on Reddit that Chain Smokers went out into the Camping area in their SUV jamming their music to make up for the cancelled act.  Then the next day they put on a great closing act.  Thats dedication to the fans.
FireflyFestival,3aqw2m,SeesEverythingTwice,5,Tue Jun 23 00:04:49 2015 UTC,That rumor came from the chainsmokers twitter so I think it's actually legit
FireflyFestival,3aqw2m,Goran1693,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:25:32 2015 UTC,That's fucking awesome
FireflyFestival,3aqw2m,DTWBagHandler,5,Tue Jun 23 16:43:59 2015 UTC,"Years ago, KOL canceled a show in the first ten minutes due to pigeons being in the rafters of a stage. They refused to go back on the stage.   The true irony is that Morrissey ended up playing while KOL didn't. KOL isn't on a busy tour right now, so there's not much of an excuse.  KOL clearly don't have the respect that Aoki has for fans.  I'm not even an EDM fan, but for all the hate Aoki has gotten for supposedly pressing a play button, he has earned my respect!"
FireflyFestival,3aqw2m,snootchie_bootch,0,Tue Jun 23 05:47:32 2015 UTC,KOL cancelled that show because the pigeons were shitting on them. That is fucking nasty and I don't blame them for walking off stage then.
FireflyFestival,3aqw2m,Goran1693,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:27:09 2015 UTC,Did they? I was in the front row for KOL and didn't see any birds. Let alone the band members.
FireflyFestival,3aqw2m,darksideofdagoon,20,Tue Jun 23 16:47:28 2015 UTC,"Steve aoki came out as the real hero of this all, the chainsmokers as well, and I dont even really like either band! Kings of Leon were headliners that wanted to be treated like headliners, I guess you cant blame them, but I can't respect it."
FireflyFestival,3aqw2m,The_Iron_Zeppelin,6,Mon Jun 22 20:31:04 2015 UTC,My friend has gone to see KoL 5 times now (including FF) and each time they have found a reason to cancel.  I think they're just unreliable.
FireflyFestival,3aqw2m,vinuash,3,Tue Jun 23 00:00:37 2015 UTC,"I had a friend who had them cancel when the... drummer? broke his rib and couldn't play, so maybe it is just prone to happen."
FireflyFestival,3aqw2m,sb412,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:23:35 2015 UTC,I was supposed to see them in Pittsburgh about a year ago and they cancelled because of injuries or something. But they played the next day or the day after in philly.
FireflyFestival,3aqw2m,vinuash,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:53:30 2015 UTC,pretty sure that's the same show
FireflyFestival,3aqw2m,laurz,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:56:55 2015 UTC,"Yup, the one other time I went to see them someone was sick and they cancelled.  They were headlining then too (back in 2007)."
FireflyFestival,3aqw2m,sleepingwithyourmom,8,Tue Jun 23 08:27:53 2015 UTC,"I was pretty bummed out that Kings of Leon got rained out. But that's exactly what happened. They got rained out. It's not like they just didn't show up. They didn't choose for the rain to cancel their show. They were there and ready to play. Yeah, they didn't have another show until Tuesday, but you have to understand that the contract they signed with Red Frog was to play on Saturday and just because they didn't have a show for a couple days doesn't mean they didn't have other obligations in their lives."
FireflyFestival,3aqw2m,TheBopper00,11,Tue Jun 23 03:17:12 2015 UTC,"Might be an unpopular opinion, but, show or birthday, or whatever, if they planned to be out after Saturday night, it's their prerogative. They didn't cancel their set, RedFrog did.   I do believe they would've played if they could've. They were actually in Dover on Friday and on the festival grounds. My wife and I spotted Nathan Followill watching Glass Animals. Why would they come a day early if they didn't care?  I think you're being too hard on KoL.   And aside from this point, everyone else is being too hard on aredFrog for the cancellation in the first place."
FireflyFestival,3aqw2m,summerstate,2,Tue Jun 23 02:03:01 2015 UTC,"I agree. I was at GovBall 2 years ago when they were set to headline, and it was the same situation. We had to evacuate because of weather and their set was canceled. They ended up playing the next day. Granted, it was a shorter set (they had to fly to the UK for a show) but they made the effort and absolutely rocked it. I was bummed to miss them this weekend, but certainly not angry at them or FF for it."
FireflyFestival,3aqw2m,Goran1693,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:58:41 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. And if they didn't end up canceling, you KNOW people would bitch about staying out in the pouring rain/slipping on mud/getting their shoes stuck/etc. some people are never satisfied."
FireflyFestival,3aqw2m,vinuash,5,Tue Jun 23 16:49:59 2015 UTC,Yeah. If no one else had shown up Sunday I think I could've understood more.. Or if they had a show the next day
FireflyFestival,3aqw2m,missjuliaaaaah,9,Mon Jun 22 20:36:36 2015 UTC,"I figured they had a show the next day. Honestly to me Kings of Leon were not headline material to begin with, and I just didn't care about enough of their songs to really care. I was planning on leaving their set early for Aoki's."
FireflyFestival,3aqw2m,delicious_grownups,7,Mon Jun 22 20:41:58 2015 UTC,Foster the People shoulda been the headliner instead of KOL. They put on an incredible show
FireflyFestival,3aqw2m,RevanDidNothingWrong,7,Mon Jun 22 21:50:06 2015 UTC,"it's funny, cos FTP was the odd-man-out headliner in 2013, closing out the whole festival over Vampire Weekend. it felt wrong then. them playing when they did this year sounds about right."
FireflyFestival,3aqw2m,delicious_grownups,3,Tue Jun 23 00:34:57 2015 UTC,"Vampire Weekend definitely would have been a better closer in 2013 but Foster the People really upped their game in my opinion. I think this was true because of a couple of things, they seemed more confident on stage, more people knew their deeper cuts and not just Pumped Up Kicks, and they weren't filling half their show with new songs that nobody had ever heard before (Literally never as they debuted Coming of Age at FF2013)"
FireflyFestival,3aqw2m,missjuliaaaaah,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:34:10 2015 UTC,"i got to see a few (handheld) fan vids my friends took, and they sounded great. I couldn't agree with you more with this whole assessment of the 2013 situation."
FireflyFestival,3aqw2m,delicious_grownups,2,Tue Jun 23 02:48:34 2015 UTC,"I didn't go in 2013 (this year was my first), but I saw them once before last year when they were the headliners for 1045's birthday show over in Camden. At the time, I was kind of, like, mildly into FTP, but I was blown away. That show totally changed my outlook on them.  Saturday's set was amazing though. Espeically being in a sea of people also jamming out. (The security guards turning up was a plus as well)"
FireflyFestival,3aqw2m,missjuliaaaaah,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:32:05 2015 UTC,"yeah i hear they really stepped up their game this year. Not that they weren't good in 13, but supposedly they were playing as-of-yet unreleased songs from their most recent album and such"
FireflyFestival,3aqw2m,delicious_grownups,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:53:31 2015 UTC,I gotchu. It's always better when bands play songs everyone knows! But maybe with a new track sprinkled here and there

Raury was fully immersed in the performance and seemed like he really cared about connecting with his fans. I'm not a huge fan of his, so I was pleasantly surprised when he shared his thoughts on social justice and songwriting.   Can't wait til he comes around to my neck of the woods!"

FireflyFestival,3asdik,craneat,4,Tue Jun 23 05:04:48 2015 UTC,My boy was yelling that the entire four days. As ridiculous as it was it definitely helped us stay together and track each other down in the crowds
FireflyFestival,3asdik,heydelinquent,2,Tue Jun 23 03:56:49 2015 UTC,"I heard that all over all weekend. My favorite though, was this hilarious, happy but cracked out girl runs up to us (sitting down and resting our feet), and starts rattling about a game she made up bc she met a guy named Garrett and then he ditched her and she decided he sucked and the name was awful so she was just running around yelling Garrett everywhere. We heard her again thirty mins later and echoed it back a bunch and she flipped out in the best way possible. Never saw her again, I hope she found Garrett, that jerk. Totally get why he ran away though."

Peppers and needing Clapton's help tuning the guitar. If I didn't completely fry my brain over the next two days I'm pretty sure that's what happened.

FireflyFestival,3arkkf,CamboMcfly,6,Tue Jun 23 15:06:46 2015 UTC,As much as people bitch about Kanye like they know him personally him being announced would sell out Tickets. So would Drake. Personally though I need way more EDM the pavilion was the best addition to firefly ever
FireflyFestival,3arkkf,sp0ck06,3,Tue Jun 23 05:42:04 2015 UTC,"Personally though I need way more EDM the pavilion was the best addition to firefly ever   I'm a huge EDM fan but I think this years ratio was perfect.  I go to Ultra to hear serious EDM.  The pavilion was fucking AWESOME and I agree my favorite addition to teh festival, but I think they had just the right amount of EDM this year.  I like coming to this festival because there's music to appeal to everyone, and once again this year I discovered some great bands like Bad Suns that I might never have heard otherwise.  That being said, they need a little more diversity within the EDM acts.  Wayyyy too much trap music, not enough house and nu disco.  I would love to see Bassnectar back."

Plus it'll be Firefly's 5th anniversary.  Muse or Radiohead- I think they will go for a nostalgic era act, that also appeals to the mainstream slightly.   Kendrick Lamar- With that expensive top two, I think it's safe to say that since there was no rap headliner this year, Kendrick could fit that number three slot.   Other predictions -Gorillaz- Won't be a headliner, but will get a prime spot. Either before a headline or close out Lawn like Modest Mouse. -Florence and the Machine -Alt-J -Twenty One Pilots -Kid Cudi returns -Tears for Fears in the Morissey slot -ASAP Rocky -The XX -Bassnectar  -Disclosure -Porter Robinson -Caribou -Brand New -Father John Misty -Catfish and the Bottlemen -Lettuce -James Blake...please  -Grimes -Royal Blood -Cloud Nothings -SZA"

FireflyFestival,3arkkf,laurz,2,Tue Jun 23 00:06:10 2015 UTC,"Hm, why do you think that is?  I feel like they're not too unlike other bands I have on my list (ie. TBS) and since they've played at other festivals recently.  Do they give off too much of a Warped Tour vibe?"
FireflyFestival,3arkkf,vinuash,2,Tue Jun 23 00:13:19 2015 UTC,"I don't know tbh. TDAG just strikes me as a super dark and moderately heavier toned album than I generally expect to see. Judging from the new stuff they've put out recently (Mene, Sealed), the new album might be relatively different, but Daisy and TDAG strike me as more Riot Fest material than Firefly. It's weird but I generally expect to just hear generally more upbeat stuff at FF.  They are playing Lolla too (iirc) so who knows, anything can happen.  You bet your ass I'd be there if they had a set at FF though :)"

My 'long shot' wishes would be Springsteen, U2, or the Stones. I also hope they never, ever get Kanye West, but if they do some people will be free to enjoy him not playing for a few hours and pouting because he didn't get the set time he wanted and I'll go to the arcade. I'd like them to wait at least a year before trying to reschedule Kings of Leon as I don't understand how they were considered headliner material."
FireflyFestival,3arkkf,Goran1693,4,Mon Jun 22 23:41:35 2015 UTC,I got free tickets for Arcade Fire last year. They put on a decent show.
FireflyFestival,3arkkf,fec2245,5,Tue Jun 23 00:05:15 2015 UTC,Kings of Leon have been around for a lot longer than you think so they have a pretty decent catalog. But if you're not a fan of their music I could definitely understand not wanting them back. FF has only gone for the hip hop headliner once with Outkast (which was amazing) but I don't know if they'd ever go for Kanye. Wouldn't care either way.
FireflyFestival,3arkkf,pghgaybro,2,Tue Jun 23 00:27:56 2015 UTC,I really like Arcade Fire but I think they're a much smaller name than Kings of Leon.  If you look at album sales or chart rankings it's not even close.  I think KoL was big enough of a name to be a headliner but they weren't my favorite choice and my opinion of them only went down this weekend.
FireflyFestival,3arkkf,Goran1693,2,Tue Jun 23 01:50:30 2015 UTC,Coldplay please.

FireflyFestival,3apjsl,JD42305,3,Mon Jun 22 17:34:12 2015 UTC,That's how they are. Their music is super low-fi and corny but they manage to be a can't miss act live just because they're so fun.
FireflyFestival,3apjsl,stinatown,2,Mon Jun 22 18:15:26 2015 UTC,"Yep--and when you've been to a few shows, listening to the recorded music reminds you of the insane fun you've had at them, and suddenly you're in love with the albums too."

FireflyFestival,3apjsl,rpd123,-8,Mon Jun 22 21:12:48 2015 UTC,I was chilling in the back just listening to their set and it seemed like they were trying way too hard. It actually kind of made me uncomfortable.

FireflyFestival,3apjsl,rpd123,-1,Mon Jun 22 23:12:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah I would have enjoyed it more, but I doubt they would have seemed more sincere."
FireflyFestival,3apjsl,DanWhisper,2,Tue Jun 23 01:00:05 2015 UTC,"True true, well I hope you had fun anyway!"
FireflyFestival,3apjsl,rpd123,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:08:59 2015 UTC,"Oh I definitely did. Still enjoyed their music and the atmosphere in the crowd seemed crazy, just thought they were coming off kind of weird. This was my first festival and it was a pretty awesome time."
FireflyFestival,3apjsl,LetThemEatCake69,3,Tue Jun 23 01:14:00 2015 UTC,"I knew it was gonna be weird as soon as Kim said ""There's only two ways to warm up: dance, or FUCKING MASTURBATE"" and proceeded to pretend to finger bang herself. Yea, that got weird"
FireflyFestival,3apjsl,rpd123,0,Tue Jun 23 04:54:23 2015 UTC,"Haha that's exactly what I mean. I guess it just caught me off guard. Their set surprised me too. It was like EDMish, which I just wasn't expecting from them."
FireflyFestival,3apjsl,LetThemEatCake69,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:00:46 2015 UTC,"I had never seen them before so I didn't know what to expect, but they fucking killed it. I talked to a few friends who had seen them previously and they said that Kim is always super provocative and crazy so I guess that's just her thing"
FireflyFestival,3apjsl,Mr-Mojo-rising,-3,Tue Jun 23 15:19:54 2015 UTC,Second this. I've seen them on purpose twice because of friends and another by accident since I needed to rest at roo.  They put on the same show Evey time more or less. And their music is boring af.   I agree lots of phoniness
FireflyFestival,3aqepv,av8rftw,8,Mon Jun 22 17:43:20 2015 UTC,Those interviewees are real sober
FireflyFestival,3aqepv,youastar,3,Mon Jun 22 20:01:46 2015 UTC,Nah I think they were just bros
FireflyFestival,3aqepv,mgrin88,3,Tue Jun 23 00:30:53 2015 UTC,Does anyone know if the AXS TV stream of Paul's show is available anywhere online? I found some decent YouTube videos of the show but something more professional would be awesome.
FireflyFestival,3aqepv,renkluaf,2,Mon Jun 22 19:01:07 2015 UTC,That second girl might be the most annoying person I've ever seen hah
FireflyFestival,3ast5x,CamboMcfly,11,Tue Jun 23 05:46:15 2015 UTC,DAFT PUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
FireflyFestival,3ast5x,jcarmona24,3,Tue Jun 23 16:32:04 2015 UTC,No that will be for 2017 if they keep up the tradition. Alive 2017! We can hope!
FireflyFestival,3ast5x,renkluaf,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:09:55 2015 UTC,That would be amazing!
FireflyFestival,3ast5x,The_Iron_Zeppelin,3,Tue Jun 23 18:56:50 2015 UTC,And Skrill would sell more tix at this festival. Check his Lolla performance vs deadmau5 Bonnaroo 2015 Performance
FireflyFestival,3ast5x,BASSANDTREMBLEMUSIC,5,Tue Jun 23 09:55:03 2015 UTC,"please no Deadmau5  asks for Skrillex   Please god no. If there's gonna be an EDM headliner, which is extremely unlikely, there's a way higher chance of it being Dillon Francis or another huge name that doesn't completely suck. Someone that'll sell tickets like it's fuckin EDC not a high school party."
FireflyFestival,3ast5x,YoungCrabman,6,Tue Jun 23 09:25:17 2015 UTC,"You can hate on skrillex all you want, but seeing him live would be the tits."
FireflyFestival,3ast5x,Buffalone27,3,Tue Jun 23 09:43:46 2015 UTC,Saw him live with Diplo as Jack U on NYE in NYC and it was craaaaazy!!!!!
FireflyFestival,3ast5x,underrager,2,Tue Jun 23 13:18:00 2015 UTC,Dillon isn't big enough for headliner material though. Not even for Firefly. I'd say more along the lines of Alesso or Axwell/\Ingrosso for headliners. Skrillex would be an ideal headliner too. He puts on quite a show and honestly it would sell a ton of tickets.
FireflyFestival,3ast5x,BASSANDTREMBLEMUSIC,2,Tue Jun 23 16:05:34 2015 UTC,Dillon Francis is huge
FireflyFestival,3ast5x,underrager,2,Tue Jun 23 17:04:57 2015 UTC,"He's not huge but he is one of the more popular producers in the electronic dance music scene. Not a realistic headliner. Tiesto (sadly) is huge. Hardwell or Armin van Buuren or even Martin Garrix are all huge. Dillon doesn't have as high of a status as them. I would say he's maybe in the 4th or 5th row on the lineup if he made it on.  EDIT: I'd also like to put as a sidenote, just because I said those people are huge doesn't mean I necessarily like them."
FireflyFestival,3ast5x,PantherFan17,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:08:37 2015 UTC,"Although I partially agree (Dillon Francis isn't that big imo), I saw skillex live and he puts on one hell of a show. Like the entire crowd went bananas for an hour and a half. I would love to see him come to firefly one year!"
FireflyFestival,3ast5x,addrockk,3,Wed Jun 24 23:01:06 2015 UTC,If you were in the Pavillion tent even once you'd know it's a Skrillex/JackU crowd. It's 2015 it's fine to love Skrillex now it's not trendy to hate him anymore lol
FireflyFestival,3ast5x,Goran1693,2,Tue Jun 23 09:53:27 2015 UTC,"is it ok to like his music, but still think he's a twit?"
FireflyFestival,3ast5x,ShitL0rd25,1 point,Tue Jun 23 10:22:02 2015 UTC,Y...yes.
FireflyFestival,3ast5x,The_Iron_Zeppelin,4,Wed Jun 24 01:00:44 2015 UTC,"Most big name edm artists went on late, which was the trend last year as well. I can't imagine a headliner being at 12pm. Also, really hope that doesn't happen."
FireflyFestival,3ast5x,znb123,3,Tue Jun 23 11:44:43 2015 UTC,"Yup.  I was actually bummed that Aoki had to go on in the middle of the day in 90 degree weather, it was redeemed by the chainsmokers closing sunday tho.  EDM is so much better at night when you can party without worrying about heatstroke.  Also I think Aoki's light effects would have been sick, just like Zedd's."
FireflyFestival,3ast5x,B4SSF4C3,4,Tue Jun 23 19:00:57 2015 UTC,NOOOOO Firefly is more unique because it doesn't feature mainly EDM artists. There's already so many festivals like that
FireflyFestival,3ast5x,Goran1693,2,Tue Jun 23 14:02:39 2015 UTC,"Deadmau5 or Bassnectar please!  I guess I'll settle for Griz, Big Gigantic, STS9, Disco Bisquits and/or Nero...  Or I'll just head on up to Camp Bisco in a few weeks :P"
FireflyFestival,3ast5x,Bjellin,2,Tue Jun 23 15:36:08 2015 UTC,Oooooh Griz would be dope.
FireflyFestival,3arf21,emacna1,24,Mon Jun 22 22:14:33 2015 UTC,Empire of the sun was incredible
FireflyFestival,3arf21,benchVT,14,Mon Jun 22 23:57:05 2015 UTC,I felt bad that sooo many people were at snoop. I went to the first like 20 minutes of snoop and it was fun and he was very entertaining but holy shit empire of the sun was insane!! That guitar smash!
FireflyFestival,3arf21,Fruit_of_the_Shroom,4,Tue Jun 23 01:18:24 2015 UTC,"Did the same thing, regretted leaving Snoop as I was walking out and then regretted not being at all of the EotS show"
FireflyFestival,3arf21,razamatazzz,5,Tue Jun 23 04:19:09 2015 UTC,"The guitar smash, and the sound it (or at least the drummer) made every time it hit the floor. My jaw was on the ground."
FireflyFestival,3arf21,jmo1687,5,Tue Jun 23 16:55:36 2015 UTC,I have a great video of it that ill upload soon
FireflyFestival,3arf21,Fruit_of_the_Shroom,9,Tue Jun 23 17:33:36 2015 UTC,Their set was unforgettable! From the visuals to the backup singers to the blasted confetti. My favorite show of all weekend.
FireflyFestival,3arf21,Buffalone27,6,Tue Jun 23 00:15:11 2015 UTC,best set of the weekend.  I literally started tearing up during Alive just from the overwhelming good energy in that crowd.  I was so tired and sore but that set was absolutely perfect.
FireflyFestival,3arf21,sp0ck06,5,Tue Jun 23 14:03:03 2015 UTC,"Hands-down my Firefly favorite, too. The dancers, the choreographed everything, the light show/LED display, the EVERYTHING."
FireflyFestival,3arf21,TheMauricio,27,Tue Jun 23 15:25:40 2015 UTC,Kings of Leon killed it - stage performance was great with that tarp
FireflyFestival,3arf21,RayFinkleFive,19,Tue Jun 23 00:30:14 2015 UTC,"Zedd and Foster the People were well worth the price of admission for me.   I didn't see any acts I didn't like, but I heard some Chiddy Bang, and it sounded terrible |:"
FireflyFestival,3arf21,missjuliaaaaah,3,Mon Jun 22 22:21:02 2015 UTC,"Zedd was fantastic, I loved the Zelda cover."
FireflyFestival,3arf21,jmo1687,2,Tue Jun 23 16:56:12 2015 UTC,WHAT. Was it later in his set?? We left a little early; we had to make it back to Rehobeth D:
FireflyFestival,3arf21,missjuliaaaaah,16,Tue Jun 23 20:27:13 2015 UTC,My favorite moment was  when Gary Clark Jr came out and played the dirtiest crunchiest guitar riffs for an hour in just overpowering heat.  It was perfect.
FireflyFestival,3arf21,caesarthegecko,5,Tue Jun 23 02:43:11 2015 UTC,I couldn't tell if my face was melting from the unbearable heat or from his otherworldly performance
FireflyFestival,3arf21,zpaceman,4,Tue Jun 23 04:14:26 2015 UTC,Or the acid
FireflyFestival,3arf21,Deriksson,15,Tue Jun 23 22:10:30 2015 UTC,I don't love edm as much as most people and yet Zedd was the best show I've been to in my life. Being like 4 rows back from that show was an experience I'll never forget
FireflyFestival,3arf21,TeamOnMyBackDoe,13,Mon Jun 22 23:12:59 2015 UTC,"Cage the Elephant killed it as always. I was very disappointed in Modest Mouse. They're one of my absolute favorite bands but they just sound like noise now, with how many members they have playing different instruments"
FireflyFestival,3arf21,Buffalone27,4,Tue Jun 23 00:16:23 2015 UTC,"Really? I'm a minor modest mouse fan, but I thought they sounded very very good."
FireflyFestival,3arf21,SeesEverythingTwice,3,Tue Jun 23 13:03:24 2015 UTC,Cage was my favorite of the weekend.   Modest Mouse is one of my favorite bands and was so excited but I was extremely dissapointed in the set.
FireflyFestival,3arf21,defense87,2,Tue Jun 23 04:10:04 2015 UTC,"Modest Mouse was a solid , but I feel like they really catered to the festival scene.  I wish I had gone to RTJ despite being a huge MM fan. Without their core fans it's not as fun (no pits, no energy, etc).  I was just disappointed in the crowds energy and the set list mostly. It was still good music."
FireflyFestival,3arf21,algar32,6,Tue Jun 23 03:30:40 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed that they played doin the cockroach, because I basically felt like a dirt grub the whole time I was there wallowing in the mud"
FireflyFestival,3arf21,cheebagreens,4,Tue Jun 23 03:34:34 2015 UTC,"Haha, yeah that was perfect. I wish they played Cowboy Dan."
FireflyFestival,3arf21,algar32,2,Tue Jun 23 03:38:06 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm glad to hear that they were good for you. Because I was/am extremely disappointed. :( looked forward to them just as much as KOL and the Killers. At least Brandon had my back."
FireflyFestival,3arf21,Buffalone27,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:39:51 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. I thought Modest played one of the worst sets I saw. Didn't seem like Isaac cared to be there. Very little fan interaction. And aside from Dramamine and Float On I didn't think they played a very ""friendly"" list. Just a lot of stuff from their second-to-last album, which quite frankly I think is their worst."
FireflyFestival,3arf21,craneat,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:58:55 2015 UTC,"You could hardly hear him for what few songs I was there for. Had to walk away and cross some other artists off my list instead since I had previously seen them a few months ago and couldn't explain to the friends I brought with me to see the act that ""they're better than this, I swear"""
FireflyFestival,3arf21,Buffalone27,11,Tue Jun 23 04:08:07 2015 UTC,No one has said it yet but vacationer's set was amazing! Such great vibes and such a good sound. There wasn't many people there so it was super personal and they sounded like the truly cared about the fans. One of the best of the weekend.
FireflyFestival,3arf21,rigill,8,Tue Jun 23 01:23:16 2015 UTC,"VACATIONER!! Hell yeah, they were awesome!"
FireflyFestival,3arf21,_Lisztomaniac_,3,Tue Jun 23 03:04:55 2015 UTC,Vacationer's set was the surprise set of the weekend for me.  I knew the guys voice sounded familiar but had never listened to them before.  Only found out he's the singer from The Starting Line when I researched them after getting home.  Love finding new bands.
FireflyFestival,3arf21,hattrickptrck22,4,Tue Jun 23 03:31:51 2015 UTC,"""Everyone wants to party, but let's turn down for one."" Best quote of the night"
FireflyFestival,3arf21,piginthenextlife,2,Tue Jun 23 19:04:50 2015 UTC,LOVED THEM.
FireflyFestival,3arf21,me2x,2,Tue Jun 23 12:04:01 2015 UTC,"Vacationer was probably the most enjoyable overall set for me. The best vibes from both the band and the crowd, and I felt like the entire audience was really into it. My favorite moment was when one guy cheered between songs ""You guys rock,"" cause it was the first time all weekend I heard positivity like that."
FireflyFestival,3arf21,bkisntexpanding,22,Wed Jun 24 01:09:27 2015 UTC,Chiddy Bang was awful.
FireflyFestival,3arf21,bigmo3091,11,Mon Jun 22 22:15:41 2015 UTC,"Holdup, holdup, holdup, holdup, holdup...Do you want to hear some new Chiddy Bang!?!? Plays 7 seconds of song holla holla holla holla shuts off music Make some nooooooooise firefly! Repeat for 40 minutes.  I really wish I was exaggerating. I saw Modest Mouse and Paul McCartney that night and the awkward train wreck of Chiddy Bang is all me and my friends were talking about."
FireflyFestival,3arf21,Atlai,2,Tue Jun 23 01:28:18 2015 UTC,"I showed up way too early to Chiddy Bang for just being a minor fan, and was stuck in the worst crowd of high children. He didn't even play his best songs and those twins dancing?? wtf was that????"
FireflyFestival,3arf21,bkisntexpanding,2,Wed Jun 24 01:10:49 2015 UTC,Why?
FireflyFestival,3arf21,JohnnyLugnuts,8,Tue Jun 23 01:14:52 2015 UTC,"Some may disagree, but I thought Modest Mouse was disappointing, I had high expectations.  I feel bad saying it, but I was looking forward to Bear Hands but they sounded nothing like their album.  Kid Cudi seemed out of it, but the show didn't really happen.   Mother Mother blew me away as did Borns."
FireflyFestival,3arf21,laurz,4,Mon Jun 22 22:25:58 2015 UTC,Mother mother was absolutely insane. It had a very concise and energetic crowd. I'm definitely seeing them again!
FireflyFestival,3arf21,Goran1693,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:34:39 2015 UTC,Ughh I wish their boston show wasn't tonight and I wasn't exhausted/working tomorrow or I'd see them a second time in a week
FireflyFestival,3arf21,laurz,2,Mon Jun 22 23:38:06 2015 UTC,Same :/ hopefully they'll come to philly soon or FF next year :)
FireflyFestival,3arf21,Goran1693,3,Tue Jun 23 00:04:06 2015 UTC,I love modest mouse but the soundbleed from kygo killed their set for me
FireflyFestival,3arf21,gravity523,3,Mon Jun 22 23:58:58 2015 UTC,Modest Mouse was also playing during a party in VIP right next to them that was blasting EDM and Don't Stop Believing almost as loud as the stage. I can see why they seemed a little unenthusiastic during that set. Performance was on point though.
FireflyFestival,3arf21,future_steak,3,Mon Jun 22 23:30:17 2015 UTC,"B0RNS was awesome! I like him, but I wasn't sure how well his music would translate to the live show, and he only has like 4 or 5 songs. But his show was really good!"
FireflyFestival,3arf21,BQNinja,7,Tue Jun 23 02:37:08 2015 UTC,I thought Awolnation cruuuuushed it. Aaron Bruno is one hell of a performer. Definitely one of my favorite performances.
FireflyFestival,3arf21,spinlighted,6,Mon Jun 22 23:50:19 2015 UTC,"Alison Wonderland, RJD2, and Run The Jewels were by far my favorite acts."

FireflyFestival,3arf21,Kangaru,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:54:16 2015 UTC,was really hoping they brought gangsta boo out for that song.
FireflyFestival,3arf21,gtk249,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:23:54 2015 UTC,El-P was so proud of himself that he got all of us to say that over and over
FireflyFestival,3arf21,UnicornCan,7,Tue Jun 23 03:39:25 2015 UTC,"while it was nice to see cudder and all, i am almost positive he forgot the words to down and out and just started doing his typical ""ooooooiiiiiiioooooo"" cudi singing. this irritated me because i know all the words, for fucks sake this guy wrote it. but i digress, he was probably fucked up.  that being said cage the elephant, glass animals, RTJ and matt & kim all blew me away"
FireflyFestival,3arf21,KingJeremyTheWicked1,6,Mon Jun 22 22:57:03 2015 UTC,"Cage the Elephant was incredible. Wolf Alice and Benjamin Booker both surprised the hell out of me, and Filibusta was surprisingly my favorite EDM act. Obviously the headliners were both great as well. The only act I was a little lukewarm on was BÃ¸rns, but maybe they were fine and I just personally wasn't feeling it. Overall, great lineup"
FireflyFestival,3arf21,TheRubberSole,10,Tue Jun 23 00:33:12 2015 UTC,"Odesza was really cool to see, put on an amazing show"
FireflyFestival,3arf21,KingYuhl610,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:34:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah! I left awolnation to see them, totally worth it! These guys made you dance like no ones business!"
FireflyFestival,3arf21,darksideofdagoon,5,Tue Jun 23 04:25:05 2015 UTC,"Dirty Heads had an energy in the crowd that I wasn't expecting. Also, Andrew McMahon did a solid job and I was impressed with how much he put into the show and how he used every part of the stage in between being on the piano."
FireflyFestival,3arf21,Onoudidnt,5,Tue Jun 23 01:02:46 2015 UTC,"Dirty Heads just slayed it. I knew a few of their more chill songs, but I was dancing like a drunk white girl at the disco when they played Medusa."
FireflyFestival,3arf21,Atlai,5,Tue Jun 23 01:31:15 2015 UTC,"My top 5   Empire of the Sun- OMFG this was an incredible experience. The setup, the vocals, the rock explosion, the vibe of the crowd: all made for one hell of a show.  Sir Paul McCartney- I experienced a legend play music for 2.5 hours and not once did he let me down. This man is pushing 75, and his energy could tangle with any big artist today. I was in bliss for this whole performance. Wow! Awolnation- Laugh all you want, this was my number one act for Firefly going in. I managed to get to the front of the massive crowd, and it was so worth it. Aaron had so much energy, the band meshed well, and it was just an intense experience for me. Crowd surfing got annoying but it was worth it! Foster the People- These guys let me down at Lolla last summer. They were phoning it in and lacked energy. At Firefly, they were jamming out, Mark was on his A-Game, and te setlist was great. They surprised me, because this was the Foster I remember when they first started out. Front row for Foster was awesome. Matt and Kim- Even after a third time of seeing them, one thing remains: Matt and Kim will be the most fun of the weekend everytime. Even dirtier, even wilder, and even funnier: this was the best one I've seen from them yet. Their energy was at 1000 at the whole set, their remix to Ignition was better this time around too.    Worst  X-Ambassadors- This was such a poor replacement for Charli XCX, they sounded average. He reminded me of Daughtry with saxophones. I tried not to laugh, but it was so generic. Hell I enjoyed Bastille more than this act, Bastille was actually decent and I hated Bastille going in. X-Ambassadors couldn't keep me interested at all. Left for Tycho....and woah Mama that was amazing!  BORNS- Man...what the hell? This act was so full of themselves. I guess that's what happens with California bands. They were too cool for school, lacked stage presence, and his vocals were pretty weak. Highly disappointed with them.  Other than that, I saw a pleathora of great acts. I would gladly do Firefly again!"
FireflyFestival,3arf21,eclecticmusicdude89,3,Tue Jun 23 14:35:25 2015 UTC,"You really hit the mark with this here. I'm also surprised that you're the only one who brought up Tycho, who I thought was by far the best on Thursday and one of the best all weekend."
FireflyFestival,3arf21,jmo1687,9,Tue Jun 23 16:59:45 2015 UTC,Bastille playing Scrubs was a highlight for me.
FireflyFestival,3arf21,future_steak,4,Mon Jun 22 23:32:35 2015 UTC,I was sitting at the brewery and thought I was imagining that.  Pretty awesome.
FireflyFestival,3arf21,laurz,4,Mon Jun 22 23:52:23 2015 UTC,"The Griswolds killed it every time I've seen them now. The Killers did good, despite what felt like a lukewarm crowd for them. McCartney also did phenomenal. The dark horse for me was Twin Peaks who put on a rocker of a set with tons of energy."
FireflyFestival,3arf21,vinuash,4,Tue Jun 23 00:02:59 2015 UTC,"I don't know why but the killers just didn't do it for me this time. They had a few good moments, but it's just didn't feel right. Maybe it was my energy finally during or maybe it was them showing up almost 25 minutes late, but I was severely disappointed."
FireflyFestival,3arf21,Box-O-Chocolate,2,Tue Jun 23 02:39:09 2015 UTC,"I didn't even really care that they showed up late really, they were probably just thrown off with all the time changes, whatever have you, but I agree that they weren't that great, especially since I'd heard from people that they normally do an awesome show"
FireflyFestival,3arf21,LetThemEatCake69,4,Tue Jun 23 06:27:52 2015 UTC,"Jon Bellion put on probably the best set I saw the whole weekend, he brought so much energy and the crowd was incredible"
FireflyFestival,3arf21,domn8r2,3,Tue Jun 23 02:29:44 2015 UTC,I had a great time at his set! I just wish he played some of his new non-rap material.
FireflyFestival,3arf21,rigill,3,Tue Jun 23 13:24:00 2015 UTC,"chiddy bang was so terrible, like so terrible..... so terrible. but zedd was amazing, odesza was pretty good, white panda was incredible, jungle rocked, matt and kim were great, killers rocked but were 45 mins late and didnt apoligize (whatever idc), empire of the sun was great"
FireflyFestival,3arf21,PToexle,5,Tue Jun 23 02:35:35 2015 UTC,Favorites:   ODESZA Empire of the Sun Paul Jungle Zedd Gary Clark Jr. Killers Matt & Kim Foster the People
FireflyFestival,3arf21,razamatazzz,6,Tue Jun 23 04:26:54 2015 UTC,Jungle was really good. I had no idea who they were beforehand so that was a nice surprise.   I thought Snoop was pretty bad and left early.
FireflyFestival,3arf21,lucy42,5,Tue Jun 23 01:36:38 2015 UTC,"It may have been because I thought it was hysterical, but I had a great time at snoop"
FireflyFestival,3arf21,Box-O-Chocolate,3,Tue Jun 23 02:39:48 2015 UTC,Snoop was one of my favorite performances! So many classic songs.. and he was absolutely hilarious. I was dancing/laughing/singing the entire time. He has such a presence about him
FireflyFestival,3arf21,zpaceman,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:16:08 2015 UTC,For some reason I just couldn't help but find Snoop hilarious.
FireflyFestival,3arf21,bkisntexpanding,3,Wed Jun 24 01:13:07 2015 UTC,"Twin Peaks was the biggest surprise to me. I listened to a few of their songs and liked what I heard and convinced my friends to see them with me, but I was not expecting them to have such a high-energy show. Everyone in my party absolutely loved them. Jungle was also a surprise because I didn't really like their studio stuff but ended up catching the last few songs of their show while getting a spot for the Kooks and they were great as well. Obviously Paul McCartney was one of the best shows I have ever seen due to the length of his set and the fact that he's a living legend. Run the Jewels was a top 5 performance for me. I was really close to the front and people started moshing and it was absolutely nuts. Gary Clark Jr. was also up there because of how much I love his type of music and his amazing solos. The Killers also put on a great show even though they started (and ended) late. Honorable mentions go to Grizfolk, Andrew McMahon in the Wilderness, Logic, Zedd, Foster the People, Max Frost, and RJD2.  As far as bad performances go, I can't say any one I went to was particularly bad, but I was personally not a fan of Matt and Kim, probably because I felt like they spent too much time talking to each other and interacting with the crowd, which I'm not a fan of because I go to shows because of the music. But that's just my opinion."
FireflyFestival,3arf21,pauler94,3,Tue Jun 23 01:01:50 2015 UTC,"Cage the Elephants killed it, plus I got to crowd surf there for the first time.  Kygo was my favorite act tho, I love his music and the bass and confetti and flames were incredible from the fifth row."
FireflyFestival,3arf21,NiceBump,3,Tue Jun 23 02:54:48 2015 UTC,Run the Jewels and the Killers fucking killed it with energy. Manchester Orchestra was pretty funny in their coffeehouse session. Grizfolk was great too
FireflyFestival,3arf21,UnicornCan,3,Tue Jun 23 03:43:19 2015 UTC,"Surprised I haven't seen this one yet. Matt and Kim completely blew me away. So much energy from them and the crowd nonstop for that hour, and seeing hundreds of people crowd surf at the same time was so cool.  Zedd was incredible for me too. I saw the Zedd5k flag and pushed my way towards it. Made friends with the people and they immediately handed me a bunch of glowsticks to throw.  Oh, and my friend had mentioned that dirty heads were playing acoustic at the coffee house before their set. We went over to check that out...turns out they were playing at the treehouse. We wound up catching Andrew McMahon play acoustic there instead and I was really happy about it, great set."
FireflyFestival,3arf21,AwfulK,3,Tue Jun 23 04:10:44 2015 UTC,"Gary Clark absolutely murdered it, loved being able to just chill in the crowd knock back some beers and vibe to his set."
FireflyFestival,3arf21,torianicole731,2,Tue Jun 23 16:43:00 2015 UTC,Dude Generationals where pissed that their hour slot time was slashed due to the reschedule for Steve Aoki. There sounded great but were robbed of a crowd. :\ they totally didn't deserve that! Would see them again in another show to make up for it.
FireflyFestival,3arf21,psychymikey,2,Tue Jun 23 02:00:00 2015 UTC,Was that why? Everyone there was pumped to see them I felt and I was really bummed they ended early. I think aoki playing over them was fine because those two crowds seem really different but I could hear aoki between sets which was unsettling.
FireflyFestival,3arf21,johnconnor8100,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:09:11 2015 UTC,If I was them I would be pissed. An hour set in a major festival with no real competition sounds like a big break. There potential curious crowd was stolen by aoki...
FireflyFestival,3arf21,psychymikey,2,Wed Jun 24 18:30:25 2015 UTC,"Obviously Cudi was a disappointment since it ended early. But there were major technical issues for his performance, did anyone forget about the mic cutting off for half of Mojo so Dope (I think it was that song). I also thought he was either off synch or forgot a portion of the lyrics to another song. For some reason right before it got shut down he seemed a little off..."
FireflyFestival,3arf21,JGreben,2,Tue Jun 23 02:04:02 2015 UTC,Bastille put on a great show! Loved their new songs.
FireflyFestival,3arf21,TheSoccerKitten,2,Tue Jun 23 02:08:48 2015 UTC,"Favorites would be Run the Jewels, Sweater Beats, and Empire of the Sun.  SNBRN was solid as well as Citizen Cope.  Cudi seemed to be a little out of it from the get go, and Walk the Moon was a disappointment.  I actually fell asleep during Morrisey's set so i guess that would have to be the worst for me."
FireflyFestival,3arf21,treesforjake93,2,Tue Jun 23 05:18:16 2015 UTC,"No one cares or watched the show but Sturgill Simpson killed it, and his guitarist was awesome."
FireflyFestival,3arf21,shidokanartist,2,Tue Jun 23 14:32:50 2015 UTC,"Matt & Kim over Sturgill Simpson was the hardest call for me to make all weekend, and I would regret it if he wasn't playing a show near me in September."
FireflyFestival,3arf21,wordnerd23,2,Tue Jun 23 15:12:39 2015 UTC,I was very happy I made the decision to go to Sturgill Simpson. Great set.

FireflyFestival,3arf21,datkidbrad,2,Wed Jun 24 00:34:25 2015 UTC,"Snopp was defiantly for the chilled laid back crowd, that wanted to smoke and chill which ive never seen that much weed smoked at a concert in my life, And ive been to a feww, And Snopp was great, Citizen COPE killed it. MATT & KIM Changed my world, and killers were just perfect."
FireflyFestival,3arf21,realtalkliam,2,Tue Jun 23 15:20:46 2015 UTC,"I thought Twin Peaks was phenomenal, and Run the Jewels blew my mind.   Did the sound at Generational's sound off to anyone else? I'm a huge fan, and though it was definitely partly their stage presence and being cut off I think part of the issue was the sound board. Could've just been me trying to find an excuse though"
FireflyFestival,3arf21,bogazicicat,2,Tue Jun 23 15:22:24 2015 UTC,"Only went Saturday Sunday but every show I went to was awesomeee. Gary Clark Jr killed it. It's not fair to describe Matt and Kim's show via typing but Ill try: FUCKING FUN. Foster the People were alright, Cudi was playing his Man on the Moon stuff before he got shut down. Aoki was a fucking party,The Bahamas were chill, Snoop was awesome, Killers were great, and White Panda was an epic closing party."
FireflyFestival,3arf21,ChirrrppinatHoez,2,Tue Jun 23 16:58:50 2015 UTC,"i was kinda disappointed in the Killers set.  great musicians, but it wasn't much different then listening to them at home - played pretty much every song to the note. i like performances where they step out of the box and groove a bit.  and i just DO NOT get what everyones deal is with Matt and Kim. i thought they were pretty generic and im not even sure that her drums were miked the entire time. I was told to expect great things and was sorely dissipointed   Empire of the Sun was life changing for me! just.... so much fun up close. they told a story with that set. no idea what that story was about, but i enjoyed it. Cage the Elephant was another band that i didnt know what to expect, and that energy made for an incredible show. also, Gary Clark. because....Gary Clark"
FireflyFestival,3arf21,HateToBeABuzzKillBut,3,Tue Jun 23 20:35:38 2015 UTC,"I thought Modest Mouse was ok. They were having a lot of tech issues and the stage next to them were blasting other shit (but I was front row for them). And Isaac Brock seemed kinda grumpy.  Foster The People were great. They really sounded on point.  AWOLNATION sounded fucking awesome. Lots of songs made me headbang and generally it was fucking awesome. Great performance.  Cold War Kids were fine. I don't really listen to them but they sounded cool.  Sweater Beats. Wow.  Walk The Moon put on a show despite me not really liking their music.  Echosmith. Cool and sounded fine.  Griswolds. I was at the Treehouse session and it was killer. Good Stuff.  Snoop Dogg. I thought he was bad honestly. The only fun aspect was smoking weed and hooking up (which I didn't do any of).  Zola Jesus. Best. Ending. Ever  Solidisco was fine EDM.  Paul McCartney. He's a Beatle, what can I say?  Matt and Kim. Both are good showmen. Crowd was going crazy.  Cathedrals. Not a lot of people were there but I thought they sounded good."
FireflyFestival,3arf21,fokerpace2000,2,Tue Jun 23 02:44:59 2015 UTC,"Steve aoki was my favorite, along with glass animals and zedd. Matt and Kim got a new fan out of me. My only real disappointment was Hozier. They sucked the energy right out of me..."
FireflyFestival,3arf21,MissLib,5,Tue Jun 23 01:40:18 2015 UTC,"What was so disappointing about Hozier? I agree it wasn't high energy at all, but his music isn't meant to be like that I feel like. I think he didn't really ""fit"" well with a lot of the other groups, but I thought he sounded fucking phenomenal and I had always wanted to see him so this was the perfect chance"
FireflyFestival,3arf21,LetThemEatCake69,2,Tue Jun 23 04:36:45 2015 UTC,"I don't know. Maybe it was me.. it just didn't do anything for me. If you're saying it's not meant to be high energy than that fine. I felt like the people around me were really, like rocking out and I felt disconnected from that so maybe that's it?"
FireflyFestival,3arf21,MissLib,3,Tue Jun 23 21:19:40 2015 UTC,"Oh it definitely wasn't meant to be that high energy, none of his music is really fast paced or anything like that. I was rocking out just because I fucking love the guy and think he's an awesome musician, so you probably just weren't as into it which is totally cool, I'm sure there are acts you loved that I probably thought were only alright, to each their own ya know?"
FireflyFestival,3arf21,LetThemEatCake69,3,Tue Jun 23 21:23:37 2015 UTC,"Best SOUNDING (no order in particular): Foster the people, Gary Clark Jr, Hozier, Paul McCartney, Modest Mouse  Best ""performance"": Snoop Dogg, Matt and motherfucking Kim (they fucked shit up, anybody see wheelchair kid or turtle guy? That shit was hilarious), Walk the Moon, AWOLNATION  Most disappointing: Cold War Kids (I think it might've been the mix, but regardless, sounded kinda shitty), The Killers (maybe my hopes were just too high?), Chiddy Bang, Citizen Cope, and Morrissey because the dude seems like a fucking prick"

FireflyFestival,3as2ub,Av1017,6,Tue Jun 23 01:36:34 2015 UTC,I have what i think are spider bites all down my arm and on my shoulder. Could be something else but there were so many spiders in premier camping so thats what i suspect
FireflyFestival,3as2ub,Fruit_of_the_Shroom,4,Tue Jun 23 01:45:49 2015 UTC,"I know the feeling, spiders everywhere in our spot in premier as well."
FireflyFestival,3as2ub,Nc_hammers,2,Tue Jun 23 01:59:09 2015 UTC,Damn that sucks. Mines definitely not from a bug it was a clear progression up my legs over the weekend and at one point it got on my hands after I made contact with the rash.
FireflyFestival,3as2ub,fancyclancy95,2,Tue Jun 23 01:55:22 2015 UTC,Some kinda poison plant or the combination of heat humidity and dirt. Try an antihistamine cream if it doesn't go away. Or the benadryl like someone else said. Mystery rashes/sicknesses post festival are pretty common. Be thankful there's no firefly flu since it was so moist.
FireflyFestival,3as2ub,vinuash,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:52:02 2015 UTC,that would definitely explain the welt I had

FireflyFestival,3as2ub,dynastybest,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:53:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I started taking that when it really started spreading. It makes the stinging go away but it doesn't seem to be getting rid of it"

FireflyFestival,3as2ub,shellzorz,3,Tue Jun 23 02:39:56 2015 UTC,"One of my friends got the firefly rash (her skin is super sensitive) and the medic tent told her the same thing, that it's probably from sitting in the grass. I'm not sure if she found any sort of cure for it, but I do know that she didn't have this issue for the previous two years, so I'd say it'll probably be resolved for next year's, since it seems they knew it was happening"

FireflyFestival,3as2ub,youastar,2,Tue Jun 23 03:08:21 2015 UTC,I got a rash too after the first night and Sunday morning. I think it's because of setting up the tent and doing yoga. The grass was super sharp and I'm assuming they treated it with some sort of insecticide before hand. It didn't hurt or itch really buy it was pretty unattractive. It's all gone now though.
FireflyFestival,3as2ub,Pulp_Ficti0n,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:17:35 2015 UTC,I figure I'm just really allergic to whatever that insecticide is I guess

FireflyFestival,3as2ub,lucy42,2,Tue Jun 23 03:07:34 2015 UTC,"The rashes are coming from chemicals in the grass. According to the staff in the medical tent, the grass was sprayed with a bunch of stuff to reduce bugs."

FireflyFestival,3ardwq,plateletP2Y12,2,Mon Jun 22 23:55:15 2015 UTC,lolol the best was walking around the grounds and pointing out all the spelling errors on the signs. jubalaya was my personal favorite
FireflyFestival,3aqge8,sznow,7,Mon Jun 22 17:55:31 2015 UTC,I got a vid of everyone singing just a friend. Like every single person
FireflyFestival,3aqge8,Fruit_of_the_Shroom,5,Mon Jun 22 18:49:20 2015 UTC,Chances are I was there. I ran into like six different groups of people singing that song throughout the week.
FireflyFestival,3aqge8,Goran1693,4,Mon Jun 22 21:42:34 2015 UTC,that song is sung at every single festival ever.
FireflyFestival,3aqge8,marylandmymaryland,2,Mon Jun 22 22:18:31 2015 UTC,"if you ever upload it, link me brotha"
FireflyFestival,3aqge8,terebithia,2,Mon Jun 22 19:14:15 2015 UTC,"Haha! Me too! I was about to pass out from dehydration, and the only thing that brought me back was the fact that people started singing around me lol helped me come to so I could get to my car safely........ And dounce myself in h 2 o lol."
FireflyFestival,3aqge8,psychymikey,2,Mon Jun 22 21:23:38 2015 UTC,I think I recorded that too! Was that in the Killers crowd right side of sound tent? This one guy kept singing stuff to get everyone pumped.
FireflyFestival,3aqge8,Fruit_of_the_Shroom,3,Tue Jun 23 02:03:25 2015 UTC,No this was during the evacuation on Saturday although i was pretty close to the one youre talking about. I was just on the right side of that big swivel camera thing
FireflyFestival,3asait,blobster13,3,Tue Jun 23 02:43:03 2015 UTC,The black guys walking around the campsites
FireflyFestival,3asait,puddy_k,2,Tue Jun 23 18:25:10 2015 UTC,"Hahaha a guy I was with bought one on Thuraday simply because he lost his duffle bag, so he proceeded to wear it the whole weekend. I'd say a good 20 people asked him where he got it, and that was only the times I was with him. I was like man you shoulda bought ten of them things"
FireflyFestival,3asait,SylvesterLundgren,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:43:41 2015 UTC,"I only saw one guy selling them and that was during Cold War kids, hope you find what you're looking for!"

FireflyFestival,3asait,summerstate,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:21:40 2015 UTC,I bought one in the hub parking lot out of an old dude's trunk haha. Last year I bought one on the bridge - that's usually where they sell 'em. Sunday night on the walk back they were selling tank tops!
FireflyFestival,3as776,A_Typical_Whiteguy,3,Tue Jun 23 02:14:13 2015 UTC,"I did Bonnaroo last year after doing the first two years of Firefly.  Bonnaroo is awesome. It's all about radiating positive vibes, and its truly infectious. I could feel the lack of positive vibes at Firefly throughout the weekend and would kind of perk up and remember that Roo spirit and try to give that back. Everyone at Roo is just nice. I would always end up talking to the person standing next to me because it just felt natural to talk about who we were going to see or how many Roo's they have been to, what other fests they like...I'm a naturally shy person, and I just feel like that doesn't happen at Firefly (maybe it just takes a certain kind of person though, I don't know.) I feel like the typical Bonnaroovian is there to take in as much music as possible, and while there are plenty of people like that at Firefly, there is also a large crowd there that's trying to get as messed up as possible.   The water situation at Roo is a lot better than any year at Firefly, because at every porta potty station, there is a water refill station. Unfortunately by the end of Roo last year the free water had been filtered so much that it had a strong sulphur taste to it and it was super unpleasant. With going back to Firefly this year I was so disappointed that they had not added more water stations...typically at Bonnaroo it's especially hot because it's June, in Tennessee  It's important to remember that Bonnaroo just had it's 14th year, they own part of the land that they use for the festival so they have -a lot- of freedom. Firefly just did its 4th year so they are still learning - and they grew really fast. The first year of Firefly had 20k attendees, and this year it was 90k (which is the same amount as Roo). Could Firefly have prepared better, knowing that their tickets were sold out? Absolutely, and I can only hope that they'll take that feedback for next year and make some serious improvements.    You said that the crew that you went with was a complaint of yours - for any festival the people that you go with are especially important. Some people can't handle festivals while others can, make sure you've got yourself in with a good group, that will guarantee a good fest no matter where you choose to go."
FireflyFestival,3as776,MySweetThreeDog,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:07:20 2015 UTC,"The positive vibes as cliche as it sounds is 100% true. Sorta jumping that goes with the crowd. I went with 5 girls who ended up leaving Saturday morning and left me to fend for myself. Ended up just staying and winging it as I'm less than 2 hours away, a ride from friends wasn't entirely crazy. The constant music would be a big thing for me. A lot of what I got from people who have been to Bonnaroo is the overall feel is more ""mature"" if that makes sense. I overall loved firefly. Though I say that with no experience of other festivals and how they are. Bonnaroo next year for sure with a much better crowd."
FireflyFestival,3as776,MySweetThreeDog,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:51:03 2015 UTC,"Mature is a great word to use for Roo. They've been at this for awhile, they know what they are doing - it's not FF's fault that they are young and still learning, Roo has 10 years on them.   Good job on winging it after your group left you - that sucks so much. I always think it's worth looking at both lineups, I went with FF this year because a. 14 hour drives suck (this is different for other people, but it sounds like you're on the east coast) and b. I can see Billy Joel like...any time at MSG (once again, another situational thing, but I think you catch my drift.) Welcome to festival life! The beginning of summer will never be the same :)"
FireflyFestival,3as776,MySweetThreeDog,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:34:54 2015 UTC,The lineup defintely is something to look at before I make my decision. Though I would have loved to see billy joel. Anywho thanks for the info. Don't know how to mark you or whatever but I'm sure next spring I may have some questions in which you may help. Take care
FireflyFestival,3as776,snootchie_bootch,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:16:07 2015 UTC,The Bonnaroo subreddit was super helpful for my friends and I when we were preparing!
FireflyFestival,3as776,MySweetThreeDog,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:54:22 2015 UTC,"I haven't been to Bonnaroo, but the only thing I can tell you about it is that it's nonstop music for the entire festival. Where Firefly shuts down at 1 or 2 am, Bonnaroo plays through the night.  Also, I believe camping is included in your ticket price."
FireflyFestival,3as776,snootchie_bootch,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:19:55 2015 UTC,"Yep, price of camping is included with your ticket for Roo."
FireflyFestival,3as776,MySweetThreeDog,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:09:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's a cool bonus. Though, I guess if a Bonnaroo ticket is more expensive it becomes a wash.  Also, loving your username, hah."
FireflyFestival,3as776,photogenicusername,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:35:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Your username is legit too.   I think that with camping included Roo ended up being a little less pricey, but not by much. Also not sure at what tier I purchased it at (if they even use tier pricing, once again, don't remember). For me, I had to factor in the cost of travel going from NJ to TN. I think no matter what major music festival you're going to, you're going to end up spending quite a bit of money, might as well have a good time while you're there and see at much music as possible."
FireflyFestival,3aq9l4,lejohanofNWC,9,Mon Jun 22 17:05:05 2015 UTC,were you the wandering monk selling booklets?

FireflyFestival,3aq9l4,ov3rb3rg3r,2,Tue Jun 23 01:18:59 2015 UTC,He wasn't selling he was giving them away and asking for donations to keep the books in print. I gave him 7 doll hairs because I liked his cause
FireflyFestival,3aq9l4,psychymikey,2,Tue Jun 23 02:05:23 2015 UTC,"hahaha no, and 'they we're free, all the wanted was a contribution of more or less than $10'."

FireflyFestival,3apz3v,indiebreadkid,8,Mon Jun 22 15:46:20 2015 UTC,Underrated but a dude on a golf car was racing towards it and drove right into that ditch next to my camp site.
FireflyFestival,3apz3v,Ezis516,2,Mon Jun 22 19:00:26 2015 UTC,"Same!  That was hilarious.  Were you the guys who shared hookah with us?  Also, I remember hearing another golf cart racing towards the fire, braking, and racing off as a girl yelled and someone called the driver an asshole.  I hope she didn't get hit too bad."
FireflyFestival,3apz3v,clam2012,12,Tue Jun 23 14:47:33 2015 UTC,"A bunch of trashy privileged scumbags decided lighting a couch on fire in the middle of campgrounds and highly flammable tents would be a great idea. I wasn't too far away, the fire was massive, people were trying to sleep nearby, others were jumping on cars throwing more things into the flames. This is why we can't have nice things. That isn't good clean fun, its shitty, irresponsible, and with all of the booze/drugs around something majorly bad could have happened.  I prayed those dudes got arrested at the very least."
FireflyFestival,3apz3v,heydelinquent,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:27:50 2015 UTC,Myself and my Fire department were literally pulling out of the compound to head home after 12+ hour  day and had to go put out that couch while they danced on cars and acted like idiots. While putting out the couch some AssHats threw 2 40oz glass bottles at us. One missed me by less then 2 feet. Unfortunately neither DSP or us saw who threw them.
FireflyFestival,3apz3v,Jmess82,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:14:35 2015 UTC,"God, what miserable pieces of shit. Sorry you had to deal with that, and I'm so happy nothing worse came of it. That was my biggest, ultra paranoid fear was a fire starting and just instantly wiping out all the tents and potentially sleeping campers. I wish people had found those dicks."
FireflyFestival,3apz3v,heydelinquent,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:20:39 2015 UTC,"That fire and the commotion it caused force my group to leave immediately and have a dangerous ride home.  May seem silly, but one girl was scared of all the noise and the fire that she got sooo anxious, she started throwing up.  Thanks for letting me start my drive with no sleep fire starters."
FireflyFestival,3apz3v,Derptard25,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:03:36 2015 UTC,"Jesus that's awful. Luckily we were sober Sunday night so we packed up, waited for the line to ease up, and hit the road around 3 am. Just did not want to stick around with those idiotic Children."
FireflyFestival,3apz3v,heydelinquent,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:32:00 2015 UTC,"Yea.  I think next year I'll get a hotel about an hour away.  Even if checkout is 11, sixish hours of sleep on a bed and a shower would be awesome"
FireflyFestival,3apz3v,Derptard25,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:53:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks you but yea we were there pretty quick, cause we received the call as we were pulling out of the compound right up the road. Also, the only good thing is that they lit it in a spot that was surrounded by empty lots. But yea it was still a hazard. If anything what got me was there were idiots lighting fire works. Thankfully nothing came of those and security was on top of that."
FireflyFestival,3apz3v,Jmess82,2,Thu Jun 25 01:55:12 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I thought they were at least smart enough to do it in the middle of the gravel road. Oy vey."

FireflyFestival,3apz3v,Jmess82,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:07:24 2015 UTC,Do you know if anyone got arrested?  (I kind of hope so)
FireflyFestival,3apz3v,Derptard25,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:07:30 2015 UTC,"I don't believe anyone did. DSP didn't really have a lot to go on there were so many people there. But don't hold me to that, after we put it out we had to scan the ground to make sure there were no more then we went home."
FireflyFestival,3apz3v,Jmess82,-27,Thu Jun 25 01:51:17 2015 UTC,you must be too old to have fun.

There is a time and place for that shit and it was not there. You must be to young to have common sense.
FireflyFestival,3apz3v,Jmess82,3,Thu Jun 25 14:12:05 2015 UTC,"This was near our site. We were on our way out when it happened. These guys near the ""ditch bridge"" in premiere brought in a couch in a hertz rental van and decided to burn it at the end of Firefly. The problem with this is that the fire got so big that nearby campers had to call security/police/fire because the embers were being blown onto other tents (which could start new fires) and nearby vehicles. Had someone been sleeping/passed out drunk in one of those tents that could have ended badly, and its the reason why we aren't suppose to have charcoal/lighter fluid on the grounds."
FireflyFestival,3apz3v,Onoudidnt,2,Tue Jun 23 05:05:53 2015 UTC,ppl lit fireworks too
FireflyFestival,3apz3v,cechk02,-6,Mon Jun 22 18:50:30 2015 UTC,Couch got set on fire and we all jumped over it a bunch.

FireflyFestival,3aqd8w,IsNotANovelty,3,Mon Jun 22 17:33:07 2015 UTC,"I used pliers to break the plastic piece, took a few minutes but it was worth it to not cut the band."
FireflyFestival,3aqd8w,ryan1046,2,Mon Jun 22 18:38:11 2015 UTC,"if you twist the ends up really tight you can eventually push it through the plastic lock. There are spikes to prevent the band from being loosened, but twisting it up can get around it."
FireflyFestival,3aqd8w,mlefoo,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:44:45 2015 UTC,"There's a swivel in them so you cant do this. However, if you superglue the swivel it will work"
FireflyFestival,3aqd8w,dheether,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:45:03 2015 UTC,"Ive heard using a straw to bypass the lock works.  Run the two end pieces through the straw and under the plastic 'spike' pieces that lock it, then you should be able to loosen it."
FireflyFestival,3aqd8w,The_Iron_Zeppelin,2,Mon Jun 22 19:15:52 2015 UTC,"To echo u/the_iron_zeppelin, cut off a two inch piece of a straw. Then cut that piece length wise down the center to open up the straw. Slide this piece through the black piece on the wristband from the inside out (pushing straw away from your wrist). This will allow you to pull the strap through the straw and leave your wristband in tack.  Enjoy!"
FireflyFestival,3aqd8w,av8rftw,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:04:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, use needle-nose pliers. Easier if you have someone else help you. I've got every wrist-band saved from a dozen+ festivals at this point. They'll be getting framed one day."

FireflyFestival,3aoss9,Glittrsweet,11,Mon Jun 22 12:26:05 2015 UTC,Agreed.  Firefly nails the bathroom sitch much much better than Roo does.
FireflyFestival,3aoss9,ilovetorunforfun,4,Mon Jun 22 12:39:33 2015 UTC,So much cleaner than Roo by far
FireflyFestival,3aoss9,Pulp_Ficti0n,14,Mon Jun 22 18:26:32 2015 UTC,"Well, the festival is being run by 20-somethings, except they're from trendy offices in Chicago (Red Frog Events). Red Frog's employees are very young, and their lack of experience shows.  I've talked to some Red Frog staff over the past few years, and they all seem like great people.  I think they're well-intentioned.  But they still have a lot to learn about running a festival.  No argument about water.  The water situation was inexcusable.  There were three water stations, but there should have been six or more.  Regarding the mud:  I'm not sure what else they could have done.  They actually did work on the grounds a lot every night.  I feel like they probably should have done more.  I just don't know what was possible under the circumstances.  Regardless, I had a great weekend.  The music was perfect, and that's the most important thing for me.  I do feel like the weather put a damper on things.  This was the first Firefly with weather issues.  Hopefully, Red Frog will learn from this.  Firefly still has tons of potential.  They'll get it right, eventually."
FireflyFestival,3aoss9,SteveBDel,7,Mon Jun 22 09:34:53 2015 UTC,"The water is a legitimate gripe but besides that I think they made the best of a shitty situation and I had a great weekend. I'm not going to write and essay response trying to convince you to come back. If firefly isn't up to your standards and Bonnaroo is, go to Roo."
FireflyFestival,3aoss9,fec2245,5,Mon Jun 22 09:58:00 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm from the ""fuck it its a festival crowd"". All of them are spawned from the original , Woodstock. I feel like it's the nature of these things to be on the less organized let it flow side of things .I just don't expect nor want hyper organization . I know it's a personal opinion and I get what you are saying but it just does not bother me."
FireflyFestival,3aoss9,The_Thane_Of_Cawdor,6,Mon Jun 22 12:30:03 2015 UTC,"Agreed but Firefly definitely attracts a much younger, teenaged crowd.  At least IMO.  I've been to every Firefly, and seven Bonnaroos (I'm 30) and damn if I didn't feel old as shit at this year's Firefly--Roo, not so much.    So many teenagers!  But I guess it's virtue of the Firefly fest being located SO close to many affluent suburban areas."
FireflyFestival,3aoss9,ilovetorunforfun,10,Mon Jun 22 12:41:19 2015 UTC,Yes ! I'm 25 and it seemed like half the people I talked to along the way just graduatedâ¦from high school.
FireflyFestival,3aoss9,The_Thane_Of_Cawdor,6,Mon Jun 22 14:17:24 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of kids are using firefly as their new senior week. I saw way too many class of 2015 shirts. I'm 25 and I felt too old for this. Bonnaroo also has a different kind of crowd overall, Firefly is filled with way more bros, and there were actually alot more families. At Roo the only kids (under 18) you see are usually traveling with their bohemian parents working the artist booths. Firefly is  a different festival though and if they were all like Bonnaroo then Bonnaroo wouldn't be such a great experience. Could Firefly pick up some pointers from roo? Sure but I just hope everyone realizes that Firefly is not a substitute for Bonnaroo, they are two completely different experiences."

The music was fantastic, and the venue was great. Literally my only gripe was the water situation. If you're not going to allow sealed water bottles in 90 degree heat with literally tens of thousands of people binge drinking, you better be able to handle the fact that people are gonna be dehydrated and want water. Other than that, I had one of the best times of my life."

FireflyFestival,3an3yn,3toss,28,Sun Jun 21 21:14:19 2015 UTC,I wouldn't go as far as to say never again but some of this year's changes were definitely disappointing.  It felt like they were trying to move away from free water to paid water which is frustrating.  Both of the water stations that we had were out of the way.  There wasn't even a water station by the main stage!  But there sure as shit were a ton of guys selling $4 bottles everywhere.  They replaced the water station that was near the main stage with a Jack Daniel's tent this year.  Good way to stay hydrated right there.   Also I was really missing the little program they had where you could pick up garbage to trade in for merch.  This year there was garbage fucking everywhere.
FireflyFestival,3an3yn,caesarthegecko,10,Sun Jun 21 23:54:30 2015 UTC,"Completely forgot about that program. It really made people start picking up recyclables and trying to get a sweater or a t-shirt from that year, I know I did last year"
FireflyFestival,3an3yn,studmuffinwastaken,5,Mon Jun 22 05:50:57 2015 UTC,"There was a water station next to the Pavilion,  next to the bathrooms; three in total, lines were long at all of them, but Sunday was hot as hell, so to be expected....in the bartering system of 'free', you pay with your time. . ."
FireflyFestival,3an3yn,FZ_PO,2,Mon Jun 22 03:45:00 2015 UTC,"I had my girlfriend with me who had recently gotten ACL/meniscus surgery and the water lines were brutal, I didn't want to leave her alone for too long (her first firefly) but it was next to impossible to get to water stations from the ADA stations."
FireflyFestival,3an3yn,Diablolo,-2,Mon Jun 22 05:00:49 2015 UTC,There wasn't one by the Pavilion though.  I walked over during Sir Paul's set figuring there'd be no line.  The lady at the beer tent told me the closest one was by the Backyard.
FireflyFestival,3an3yn,caesarthegecko,3,Mon Jun 22 13:06:47 2015 UTC,It was to the right of it
FireflyFestival,3an3yn,xXxTrollxXx,18,Mon Jun 22 13:38:12 2015 UTC,"The water situation is definitely the most egregious.  Cutting down to just two stations is totally unacceptable, especially if you are going to charge $4 for a small bottle.  I'd have been fine with only being able to buy water, if it was half that price.  Allowing people to bring in water on the later days was a concession to this mistake, so I hope its fixed in the future.    The mud situation- they did work on overnight/morning after Thursday and their work helped a lot. However, more preparations could have been done for it.  It might be dry and dusty, it might be wet and muddy, prepare for both.  The overnight parking was still a fiasco.  There were supposed to be shuttles to take you from overnight to premier camping and two other locations, but they didn't take you to any of those because of a miscommunication with the police, who were blocking everyone from the roads.  The shuttles instead dropped people off at the gas station in front of the Home Depot.  You had people who were carrying all their camping supplies now walking miles, if they were still able to even carry their loads that distance.   Cancelling Saturday- I don't know enough the specific % of danger to festival goers in a situation like that, but it seemed premature.  From my understanding the storm was more severe further north in Delaware but never really manifested in Dover at that level.   I suspect most the danger was more to performers with lightning than campers with water, but like I said I really don't know.  The lineup overall was weaker than ever before as well.  Much more indie / lesser knowns, which is fine and I had a lot of fun trying people I'd never heard of but seemed like a different direction to me.  I would have been more happy with this direction if one day passes were still a thing, not really sure why they got rid of those.  Not in a ""never again"" like OP but this was the worst year of Firefly so far, which makes it only 50x better than a regular weekend"
FireflyFestival,3an3yn,UncouthInlet,5,Mon Jun 22 01:39:15 2015 UTC,"The cancelling Saturday was really annoying, just because it was REALLY mishandled. I was watching Sublime with my wife, and they basically shut off the PA in the middle of a song and start telling everyone in that they are in imminent danger and to leave immediately. Well, they could have warned premier campers to wait for a minute, since while I was walking back towards the main stage, they cancelled Kid Cudi and I had to lead my wife through a crowd of thousands that was jammed up trying to get to opposite entrances. A much better thing to do would have been to announce that the festival was closing in 30 minutes to let bands finish up and allow people to not all rush for the exit at one time. Ridiculous.  Only thing I was unhappy with. My wife is very short, can't see over most people and had literally no way to see where she was at in that crowd. Luckily, I didn't lose her."
FireflyFestival,3an3yn,Atlai,13,Mon Jun 22 11:57:20 2015 UTC,"There was a lot of negatives about this festival, but to me there were a lot of positives too. The weather was damn hot, the mud thick and shitty, the storm was a liabilty thing for Red Frog,and I got freakin sick on Friday! But I also got to spend time with friends, camping, watching concerts, and discovering new music. I think it all depends where you want to focusyour energy."
FireflyFestival,3an3yn,darksideofdagoon,13,Mon Jun 22 03:31:30 2015 UTC,"They definitely over exaggerated the weather   You do understand that when you have 90,000+ people in one place and there's an official tornado warning, you have to evacuate, right? Imagine the shitshow if the tornado had come and Firefly didn't do anything. Yes, it wasn't super likely, but for public safety, they had to be careful. Any music festival in the US would've done the same, given the circumstances.   the staff was crazy rude   It sucks that they were rude, but you get that they're unpaid volunteers with absolutely zero say in anything, right? There's nothing they can do about the fact that you brought your nice shoes to a music festival and weren't expecting them to get dirty.   Also, mud isn't exclusive to Firefly... Lots of festivals have that issue. You didn't stay today, but had you stayed, you would've noticed that they put down a lot of something (I didn't even know what it was) to cover up the worst mud patches today, so it wasn't even bad."
FireflyFestival,3an3yn,porkypenguin,-3,Mon Jun 22 07:02:17 2015 UTC,"You do understand that when you have 90,000+ people in one place and there's an official tornado warning, you have to evacuate, right?   Am official warning means a tornado touched down or was spotted on radar.   I receive similar notices on my phone all the time, i.e. the flood watch that was released that night for dover,  but nothing regarding high winds.      the staff was crazy rude   It sucks that they were rude, but you get that they're unpaid volunteers with absolutely zero say in anything, right? There's nothing they can do about the fact that you brought your nice shoes.   So I'm not completely ignorant and brought my nice shoes. I actually brought three pairs, because I have camped before...  My issue was with paid staff,  who i specifically asked if they volunteered or were paid. I have no reason to get mad at a volunteer,  but someone who was supposedly a supervisor basically told me to shit next to my car, it was safer than a portable toilet.   An official tornado warning means an actual tornado touched down, or was spotted on radar. I received no such notification on my weather app or texts which always show alerts and warnings. I received a flood watch,  but that was it."
FireflyFestival,3an3yn,porkypenguin,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:06:49 2015 UTC,"You'll have to forgive my confusion; I mixed up tornado watches with tornado warnings. It was a watch, the less severe distinction, and I do recall seeing it for a bit on my weather app, but it went away soon after we were all evacuated. However, there were still severe thunderstorm warnings, and that's dangerous with the big metal stages and speaker stands and tons of people in a big field. With that many people potentially in danger, the evacuation was understandable.  The distinction between volunteer and paid staff is significant, that makes it a lot worse that the people were paid supervisors. Still, this is part of the liability/safety thing from Red Frog. It sucks, but they were also probably told to keep everyone away from tents and portable toilets."
FireflyFestival,3an3yn,MissLib,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:40:59 2015 UTC,"It literally says on the website that the shows are weather permitting. Lightning will shut down an outdoor concert anywhere.

FireflyFestival,3an3yn,plateletP2Y12,20,Tue Jun 23 02:09:39 2015 UTC,All that stuff I'm fine with. The water situation is the only part I really blame them for. I think next year I will come back but stay at a hotel or rent an rv. But that's because I'm not much of a camper. It can be rainy and muddy all festival as long as I have a real bed and shower to go home to.

FireflyFestival,3an3yn,Diablolo,6,Tue Jun 23 00:26:14 2015 UTC,"Just a few complaints as someone who was using ADA assistance all weekend 1. I agree water stations were a problem, location made them really hard to get to if you had a wheel chair, and the lines were long and practically flooded. 2. VIP people had way too many carts, we had people who could not walk waiting up to 30 minutes for a cart when 15+ VIP carts would drive bye. And on top of that, when evacuation happened on Saturday carts were coming even slower and when we got to the entrance we saw 20+ carts just sitting on the side.  3. Southernmost Falafel wasn't there, broke my heart. 4. Knockoff Bob Saget Other than that and the mud (really wasn't much that could be done), I had a great time. Spent more than I had wished on food alone but the ADA staff was amazing  happy and super real about everything going on. Also the security staff was amazing. Hoping some money is refunded for Saturday night ending early but don't expect it to happen. I hope you give firefly another chance! Have a safe journey home!"
FireflyFestival,3an3yn,DTWBagHandler,5,Mon Jun 22 05:16:05 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why they made us wait in a long line to scan our wristbands to exit to premier camping today? It was hot as hell, there was no explanation as to the importance of the exit scan. They only had two scanners for the exit, clearly someone dropped the ball in planning. I don't recall having to scan to exit last year. I'll be switching to Roo, it seems better run."
FireflyFestival,3an3yn,delicious_grownups,2,Mon Jun 22 00:51:04 2015 UTC,I think they've made me scan to leave at the end of every year actually. I think they do it for data collection purposes
FireflyFestival,3an3yn,JD42305,2,Mon Jun 22 05:27:06 2015 UTC,I think also for people leaving early so they can't sell their wristband.
FireflyFestival,3an3yn,Pulp_Ficti0n,2,Mon Jun 22 18:33:25 2015 UTC,"My biggest complaint beyond the water stations was our neighbors in premier camping. I hope you read this you assholes (mentally challenged/heavily intoxicated guy, girl who threw a bloody tampon next to my car, fat blonde who kept peeing by my car) because you were fucking idiots. You also puked by my car and on your own car. I remember my first beer, too, fucking twat. I was this close to letting the air out of your tires before leaving Sunday night. Karma will get you, though. Enjoy!"
FireflyFestival,3an3yn,The_Thane_Of_Cawdor,3,Mon Jun 22 18:25:09 2015 UTC,"lol, i don't have any complaints. I was also staying at premier camping. I think the firefly staff did a good job with being present enough to take care of issues but distant enough to not feel like you were at summer camp with camp counselors ready to take care of your whims"
FireflyFestival,3an3yn,TheBopper00,3,Sun Jun 21 22:03:48 2015 UTC,Why downvotes?
FireflyFestival,3an3yn,The_Thane_Of_Cawdor,5,Mon Jun 22 03:35:59 2015 UTC,"I think some people expect too much ""customer service "" at music festivals . My mind set going in was to be self prepared so I had no issues  with water or anything like that"
FireflyFestival,3an3yn,L1eutenantDan,2,Mon Jun 22 12:20:36 2015 UTC,"Fucking seriously! Look I hate it that people had a bad time but you just have to be able to roll with the punches that living outside for four days and being fucked up for most of that time is going to throw at you. Plan it out before you go like it's not gonna be comfy and that the weather will fuck you up. I've seen complaints ranging from too muddy to crappy lineup and I just don't get any of it, biggest bummer of the weekend for me was cigarettes are 12 bucks a pack inside the festival.   Lack of water stations? Yeah not ideal, but no one gave you shit for bringing in full bottles as long as they were sealed after day one and you better believe that'll be priority number one after all the complaining going down after this year."

As a former smoker though, I feel your pain. Wonder if water complaining people spent money on cigarettes..."

Thursday was muddy, yes but there was a great recovery on Friday and Sunday. I barely got muddy on Sunday. You didn't have to walk through it, there were ways to avoid it if you were paying attention. This was my first firefly and I won't comment on a lot of stuff since I had a different experience but the festival grounds, considering the amount of rain, were surprisingly well managed, in my opinion.."
FireflyFestival,3amrlz,plateletP2Y12,5,Sun Jun 21 19:25:19 2015 UTC,I've heard that they're talking about doing two weekends next year.  That may delay the announcement if so.

FireflyFestival,3amrlz,snootchie_bootch,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:55:41 2015 UTC,Last year they announced the dates and early bird passes literally right after the festival. But it is pretty consistently the third weekend in June!
FireflyFestival,3amrlz,ponyofish,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:56:22 2015 UTC,"honestly the first year it was the third or fourth weekend in july actually, but every other year has been the third weekend in june. i think that they most likely have it set for that weekend since they signed on for ten more fireflys at dover speedway back in 2013. I imagine they hold down the spot and while it may be subject to change i'd still keep your eyes on the third weekend in june if possible"

This was my first time, so I was like ""let me get a room so I have somewhere to really sleep and all"" and I'm glad I did. I got a nasty migraine Sunday and had to leave early /:  I get migraines pretty regularly (enough to have prescription stuff) but I go to a TON of shows back home, and never had issues lol.

FireflyFestival,3aikrx,fancyclancy95,-1,Sat Jun 20 17:15:47 2015 UTC,"I went to Roo and now I'm at Firefly. The festival is managed a lot worse. Only two or three water stations and it's crazy muddy. Also now comedy/cinema tents so there's not much to do until about 4pm. There's not that fun-weirdness about the festival like Bonnaroo either. It's okay, killer lineup but not much of a comparison to Roo."
FireflyFestival,3aikrx,NukeGandhi,8,Sat Jun 20 18:05:10 2015 UTC,"Firefly IS in it's infancy, however, while ROO's been going since like 03' or something.  Firefly, for me anyway, because i'm more of an indie/alr rock guy, has a more desirable lineup, but you're exactly right.  There's just something about Bonnaroo, something about the culture that's, well, cultivated over years of history there, something that for whatever reason, no other festival can touch.  Besides burning man I guess, but the music there sucks, and it's mostly for art and peyote.  Music aside, Bonaroo was amazing.  Last year, however, several of my favorite bands were at Firefly and I would argue that the lineup there blew away ROO's, but it's not as eclectic.  You have Lionel Richie, Skrillex, and Chance the Rapper all at one place.  I also don't like EDM like, at all, so for that Firefly had a better lineup for me last year.  I'm just rambling.  penis"
FireflyFestival,3aikrx,DrakeSucks,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:45:09 2015 UTC,I expected firefly to be shittily managed but there are at least 2 dozen people im friends with that are there and I miss them and told a lot of them that I'd go. So for me firefly would've been preferred because i could be king Clancy instead of ol clanky like I was at roo. The amenities might be better at roo but I'd rather sit in a muddy field surrounded by friends trying to figure out how were gonna make a case of water last 3 days for 3 people than get to shit in a flushing toilet and wash my hands. I miss the adventure and that's probably more just me than fest vs fest
FireflyFestival,3aikrx,fancyclancy95,2,Sat Jun 20 19:06:32 2015 UTC,"I did FF last year and ROO this year. ROO was incredible and lived up to all the craziness that I expected, but it was way. too. fucking. hot for my liking.  I felt like I couldn't experience every bit of it to the fullest because I was so concerned with how to try and attempt to stay cool.  Then again, I'm from Canada so my threshold for heat may be lower."

FireflyFestival,3aja59,akersh02,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:13:09 2015 UTC,They don't allow the tubes of sunscreen because they can potentially be filled with alcohol.   That or they want you to buy their $20 bottles.

FireflyFestival,3aflu0,crowelad,12,Fri Jun 19 23:27:46 2015 UTC,"So I could forgive them for mistakenly not having enough water stations  (despite the complaints from last year), but when I go to the bar and ask for a few cups of water or ice and the bar tender tells me he can't give that to me, then it is clear that this lack of water situation is an unethical system put in place by management to squeeze every last dollar out of us. It is an awful and immoral practice which will lead to someone getting seriously sick."

FireflyFestival,3ah02f,SteveBDel,4,Sun Jun 21 20:32:47 2015 UTC,I agree. The 2013 lineup really stands out. That's still my favorite year of Firefly (so far).  A lot of the small-print names from that year have become hugely popular since then.

They're looking for drugs, cash, and electronics. Advice is to keep these things on you, or locked in a vehicle. Then, if it happens, you're out the cost of a tent only. Fest smart people! Duct tape should get you through the remainder of the weekend."

FireflyFestival,3adloi,thunderpunchyt,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:08:51 2015 UTC,You twist the tail of your wrist band super tight.  Then you have to spin the lock in the same direction the tail is twisted. It's important that the be no exposed edges for the teeth of the lock to snag in or it will not lock.  This method worked for me.  My wrist band was super tight because it got pulled by accident.  Nice and loose now and no damage.  Took a couple tries but worked well.

Just stroll around, and ask people who are obviously part of the circuit.   Firefly usually has a much smaller drug influx compared to other festivals. Lot of drinkers and smokers, not so much the rest."
FireflyFestival,3abslo,atmospherical,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:56:23 2015 UTC,I experienced this when I went a few years ago. Was extremely difficult to find. At others fests it seems to drop in your pocket without asking haha
FireflyFestival,3abslo,Bukubucks12,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:06:26 2015 UTC,Pretty much.... The lack of a security check when you get there also has a lot to do with it.   Everyone just brings their own stash.

FireflyFestival,3a98xv,WhoWantsAHug,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:09:41 2015 UTC,Look around route 1 for places that will let you park overnight. You could do day parking and drop your things off at your campsite and then go back and park overnight at one of the places outside of firefly that will be selling spots and walk back.
FireflyFestival,3a98xv,Glittrsweet,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:18:04 2015 UTC,"Delaware State University has a large parking/camping lot across Route 13 from the festival (next to the Delaware Agricultural Museum).  Not sure how much they charge.  Or, just drive up and down Route 13 near the festival, and keep your eyes open.  There are several places that will let you pay to park.  You can still try to buy an Overnight Pass at Firefly's Will Call. Sometimes they sell passes on-site, even if they're listed as ""sold out."""
FireflyFestival,3a98xv,SteveBDel,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:20:40 2015 UTC,another question: I'm crashing with friends at the premier camping spot and driving up there friday morning. Is there anywhere nearby that I could park overnight?

I got 15lbs in slab form (not pellets) and put it on the bottom of my cooler with several layers of thick paper between the ice and my beverages. Kept the entire cooler chilled perfectly from thursday through monday for a whopping $13. And yes, don't put the ice over your beer unless you want exploding frozen cans, but liquor can go under to be extra chilled (but you don't want to be touching the ice so might be best to just keep it on top under your beer)."

FireflyFestival,3a7h5r,Babou_Serpentine,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:49:42 2015 UTC,Yes! I had no problem with this last year. I had a bunch of empty plastic bottles that I refilled as soon as I got in the festival. I didn't have to go the refill station at all after that.
FireflyFestival,3a7h5r,Sto0pkid,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:55:24 2015 UTC,"Actually, any kind of water bottle is okay (except glass).  Metal and plastic bottles are fine.  People use all kinds of containers."
FireflyFestival,3a4f7r,WorkOfArt,16,Wed Jun 17 03:41:51 2015 UTC,"I cannot believe that after so many people complained about the lack of water stations that they didn't add at least a couple more. Maybe they'll be bigger or FF did something to up their efficiency, but that's probably just wishful thinking"
FireflyFestival,3a4f7r,Deriksson,12,Wed Jun 17 04:10:01 2015 UTC,Firefly is telling people by email and Facebook that they'll have 3 water stations this year.  The third just isn't on the map.  I guess we'll find out on Thursday.
FireflyFestival,3a4f7r,SteveBDel,3,Wed Jun 17 04:25:24 2015 UTC,3rd one is on the map in the app
FireflyFestival,3a4f7r,gravity523,2,Wed Jun 17 13:57:35 2015 UTC,"Irs mind boggling.  At least set up a few small ones or something.   2, maybe 3 water stations for what, 50k people? Wtf?  I don't understand how they can do such a good job improving the festival and accounting for feedback and ignore the most important request by far.  Its only a matter of time beforr someone potentially dies because they took a bunch of drugs and didnt feel like waiting in a 30 min line to get water."
FireflyFestival,3a4f7r,sp0ck06,9,Wed Jun 17 04:38:55 2015 UTC,Supposed to be 90k.

FireflyFestival,3a4f7r,Pulp_Ficti0n,6,Wed Jun 17 04:37:09 2015 UTC,Bonnaroo had a 30% chance on the driest forecasted day a week before the festival. I bought and packed plastic bags of all shaped sizes and types. We got like 5 minutes of rain on only one day. Weather can be weird. But now I have a lot of supplies for the future.
FireflyFestival,3a4f7r,fancyclancy95,3,Wed Jun 17 05:12:47 2015 UTC,Yeah those short showers in the morning were so nice. Long enough to cool down but short enough to not make it all swampy

I put my band for a different festival on a little tight one year and was able to loosen it using the first technique. It'll save you the $20 to replace the band too."
FireflyFestival,3a657z,SteveBDel,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:48:09 2015 UTC,Thanks for the response.  Ive seen the twisting trick but i cant seem to do it (maybe because its not on my wrist).  Im going to try it later with the help of another person.

I wasn't planning on seeing any DJs at Firefly because I'm more of a house/techno guy and don't really care for all the big EDM acts, but I can definitely get into this.  I was planning to head back to camp after clean bandit, but now I think I'll head to the Pavilion stage."
FireflyFestival,3a2965,MmmmBeer814,3,Tue Jun 16 19:03:41 2015 UTC,"I hear you, did they really need to grab +10 trap djs for this festival? Shit just throw in one or two house/techno djs It would have made the lineup much better"

FireflyFestival,39zqh4,wtmkevin,12,Tue Jun 16 02:35:15 2015 UTC,Odesza and modest mouse for sure!
FireflyFestival,39zqh4,gravity523,12,Tue Jun 16 02:55:02 2015 UTC,"Wow this is awesome, I've seen you guys three times, and this will be my fourth. I'm destined to hear ""Up 2 U"" on this festival run, because it hasn't happened yet haha. Anyone thinking of missing their set, I strongly advise you to go to one of the best sets all weekend long! You guys found a way to be commercial but still have an edge, keep it up!  OK. So here's some bands I think you should check out on Friday.  Clean Bandit. This act will be an early dance party, if you dig Disclosure, Duke Dumont, or Rudimental: then this is perfect for you.  Can't stress enough how powerful of a set Manchester Orchestra will be, I've seen them three times and the same intensity that Brand New brings, Manchester brings it even more!  I won't get to check out this awesome rock act from Canada called Mother Mother. They play at 4:00, but they were one of the most diverse acts on the lineup and I've heard nothing but rave reviews.  Right after you guys get the whole woodlands rocking and vibing, please go check out Cage the Elephant. Wow! No offense to any black keys fans, but when I saw these guys open for Black Keys in the fall...Cage left me speechless. A tough act to follow, and a seasoned act worth all the hype!  Double dose of Cage and Awolnation might knock you out, so if you're looking for something a little more mellow, do not miss Odesza! One of the most exciting live electronic acts out there right now!  Glass Animals are going to be so groovy, they will be hard to pass up.  If you want a little but of everything, obviously Modest Mouse is a sure fire must see. If you want something hype, then come Run Them Jewels Fast! Heck even Sturgill Simpson digs this act, it'll be an epic set right before Sir Paul graces us all.  Sir Paul....duh!  If you still have energy after all of that, rage it up at Zedd, or mellow out with Marian Hill.  See you guys at the woodlands!"
FireflyFestival,39zqh4,eclecticmusicdude89,5,Tue Jun 16 09:05:12 2015 UTC,Can you please do a similar write up for Saturday!
FireflyFestival,39zqh4,intelligentgamer,9,Tue Jun 16 11:37:42 2015 UTC,"Here's some highlights for Saturday.  If you're not starting your day off on Saturday with Andrew McMahon, even with a most likely hangover....highly suggest you do. I've seen him with Jack's Mannequin when he opened for The Fray back in '09, and it should've been the other way around. Andrew has an insane amount of energy, and they didn't schedule him early as a coincidence, they want people to not waste their day. This will be a highlight for sure.  Griswolds were a blast when I saw them at Roo last year in a small garage, I was just charging my phone. Then all of a sudden, I just started dancing and rocking: this band is great live.   Not trying to do a double dose of energy, then come mellow out with me and my crew to the eclectic vibe of Milo Greene. It'll be a smaller crowd, and they will be the next up just like Of Monsters and Men and Lumineers. Good vibes and anthemic choruses.  I was already 1000% sure I was seeing Gary Clark Jr, and then this assurance went up even more after watching his Roo set at home. This is gonna be a hell of a show, soulful, funky, bluesy, and a rocking good time. Don't even think of missing him!  Still need to check out Sturgill, but anyone who comes out to Run the Jewels and is a country singer? Gets me thinking, maybe I should check this guy out.  The most fun you will have all weekend will be at 6:15 on the firefly stage on Sat. Matt and Kim are wild, dirty, random, and are pretty damn talented. You don't go to this set for cohesion, you go for a sure fire way to enhance your festival experience minus the drugs. Seen them twice, and most recently in June at a free show in Buffalo, they have upped their randomness by a ten fold!  You'll be exhausted after this set if you can stay through it all. So go vibe out to Dirty Heads, they are part reggae, rap, and more recently pop influence with ""My Sweet Summer"": get the ganja out and just sway to the tunes man.  Or maybe you want to continue to turn up? Then come join me in the tented Pavillion stage where trap reaches new heights, thanks to Alison Wonderland. ""Cool"" and ""Run"" are sure to get you hype.  Spoon is a fantastic band, and they aren't mellow live. They are a nice balance of slower tunes, rocking tunes, and even jam band style. This is a hell of a band, because Brit Daniel is so passionate. If you've never seen them before, you will love this set!  Foster the People were great when they first started out, but when I saw them at Lolla last year: it was so predictable and lacked energy. I'm going to this set, because when they play this fest: they tend to be on their A-game live.  I might sneak away to the mellow vibes of The wind and the wave, playing a smaller stage and digging their tunes. It'll be nice to see a good band before they rise to fandom.  Really digging vacationer too, they remind me of Vampire Weekend and grizzly bear. Two of my favorite bands! Might sneak over here too.   I've never seen Chainsmokers, and when I saw them on the lineup...I was like ""here's another cheese EDM act"", but they slice it a little better than I thought. Sick remixes of indie, rap, and pop tracks. Their original material minus that damn ""selfie"" track are pretty good too. So I'll be here for a little bit.  Kid Cudi hasn't really had any material lately where I've been impressed. However, his show is quite fantastic. He has a certain flow and style that is awesome to see live. His set is a great balance of everything from his mixtapes to WZRD and beyond. Maybe he plays some new track too. Gonna check a little out here too.  Laugh all you want....Kings of Leon are awesome live. They aren't going to covert haters into fans, so don't go expecting this. They get up there, rock the fck out and have a deep catalog that will make any fan of them say ""I'm glad I came to Firefly.""  Aoki can just go away. I can't take this guy seriously, even if this will be a fun set...he's what is wrong with EDM today. Basic, boring, and unoriginal. No thanks. And he wastes all that cake...poor cake :-/  Lettuce is the place to be. The funkiest band on the lineup, and a nice roster of songs. Great way to start the LN.  Then close the night with another trap afficianato, Rustie has impressed me with his albums. He's gotten rave reviews live, and I hear his light show is something to behold. Heck he's on the main stage, not Aoki? EDM's best kept secret at Firefly? Maybe...."
FireflyFestival,39zqh4,eclecticmusicdude89,2,Tue Jun 16 14:05:50 2015 UTC,Lettuce!!!
FireflyFestival,39zqh4,tisnolie,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:13:05 2015 UTC,Rustie is 100% the best kept EDM secret at Firefly.  Just saw him at Roo midday and it was one of the rowdiest crowds I've ever been in (similar to Danny Brown the year before).
FireflyFestival,39zqh4,deajsa,0,Tue Jun 16 14:53:53 2015 UTC,"Foster the People were great when they first started out, but when I saw them at Lolla last year: it was so predictable and lacked energy.

I might sneak away to the mellow vibes of The wind and the wave, playing a smaller stage and digging their tunes. It'll be nice to see a good band before they rise to fandom.   if you want another option, Luca Lush is a super solid producer that will probably have a small crowd and imo is one of the best kept secrets at the fest"
FireflyFestival,39zqh4,sp0ck06,4,Tue Jun 16 18:28:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the write-up sir! Im definitely checkin out my friends cage and awol, but I like the glass animals suggestion. they have been on my firefly scope since we first saw the lineup. Ive seen Paul from front-of-house before and was practically in tears the entire time. will definitely stick around for him. Never heard of clean bandit. will check out."

FireflyFestival,39zqh4,tbear865,5,Tue Jun 16 03:19:51 2015 UTC,Always been a big zedd fan. would KILL to write with him. such a tasteful blend of pop and progression.
FireflyFestival,39zqh4,jcarmona24,3,Tue Jun 16 21:12:29 2015 UTC,Yesss. I was at this exact show. It was incredible.
FireflyFestival,39zqh4,sashkibash,2,Tue Jun 16 05:20:42 2015 UTC,SAME! I remember walking out the back of the crowd going to Jack White and I couldn't believe what happened to me...then all of a sudden HAMAGEDDON lit up right in front of me then I knew I was in heaven. That show was sick tho
FireflyFestival,39zqh4,YoungCrabman,7,Tue Jun 16 15:27:47 2015 UTC,You probably won't want to miss that Paul dude's set.

Other than that, Awolnation, Run the Jewels, and Zedd are high energy sets. Cage the Elephant overlaps with your set a bit but you might be able to catch the end of it.

Modest Mouse is going to be a great show, just because they have a new album out they'll be playing. But I find it hard to circle anything after you guys play other than Paul! Have a great time there, hope to run into you!"

FireflyFestival,3a3ubw,Vagrantmonarch,2,Wed Jun 17 01:53:10 2015 UTC,Greyhound or maybe mega bus ..I'm coming from NYC area and greyhound told me 30 dollars.  Edit: I don't know dover Delaware at all so I'm not sure where you'll be dropped.

FireflyFestival,3a3nh9,Goran1693,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:57:08 2015 UTC,Not in the woodlands. A skateboard would be a great mode of transportation around the area.  There really isn't any local skate spots. But there are a few skate parks. There is one on Rt 13 north of Firefly across the street from the WalMart. I believe it's called Black Tie. Then there is a public park in Smyrna.

Saturday: The Griswolds would be awesome to see in a smaller setting, saw them at Roo in a garage charging my phone last year and they were awesome!  Sunday: Tove Lo...please!!!! This EOTS vs Tove Lo blows, they could've easily put her earlier in the day, and they didn't.

FireflyFestival,39y1wd,SweetLikeSugarVenom,17,Tue Jun 16 11:03:08 2015 UTC,I don't mind people moving forward when they're alone or in small groups.  There's usually enough gaps in the crowd to facilitate this.  What gets me is when groups of 10 or more try to barge through after a show has already started.
FireflyFestival,39y1wd,ObsessiveDelusion,12,Mon Jun 15 19:24:42 2015 UTC,Even worse when they hold each other's hands as they push through
FireflyFestival,39y1wd,dheether,5,Mon Jun 15 19:28:14 2015 UTC,I literally hate this the most. the people not in the front of the chain try to apologize the entire time and act like there was no way they could have not done that and let go
FireflyFestival,39y1wd,sonoem,7,Tue Jun 16 12:17:45 2015 UTC,"I honestly hate this just as much as the next person, but I will say I was kind of in this situation last year. I went with two other friends last year who did this despite me asking them multiple times not to (them drunk, me sober, surprise!)  but at the same time I couldn't just leave them. So I ended up being the staple apology girl at the end of the line even though the rudeness of it make me extremely uncomfortable.   Seriously though, that shit is so inconsiderate and there's really no need for it. I'll try to keep all my buds in line this year."
FireflyFestival,39y1wd,hooch,13,Tue Jun 16 13:54:50 2015 UTC,"If you're nudging in front of somebody, please also consider their height in relation to yours."
FireflyFestival,39y1wd,photogenicusername,11,Mon Jun 15 19:45:47 2015 UTC,"I went to a concert once and was a few rows shy of front. Eventually this guy came barreling forward, pushed past my friend and I, and stood right in front of me. He was easily over 6 feet (I'm only a 5'7 female ) so I politely asked him ""hey would you mind switching? You're a lot taller than I am and now I can't see."" He turned around and told me to fuck off."
FireflyFestival,39y1wd,theculpr1t,10,Mon Jun 15 20:14:28 2015 UTC,That guy makes us tall males look bad.. I'd definitely switch spots at 6'2. I don't even have to be very close to have a good view of the stage. It's always in the back of my mind that I'm probably blocking someones view but there's not much I can do about it either.
FireflyFestival,39y1wd,photogenicusername,2,Mon Jun 15 22:18:14 2015 UTC,And I understand there is nothing you can do about your height. There are people with totems and phones who block views as well. But it's all in good fun. If this guy wasn't a dick about it I wouldn't  have had a problem. I appreciate you and your consciousness though :)
FireflyFestival,39y1wd,fec2245,6,Tue Jun 16 01:44:42 2015 UTC,I'm not that tall so it's not a situation I've been in but if the guy was really tall and he kept switching with everyone shorter than him he might end up pretty far back before someone could see over him.  No matter where a tall guy goes he's probably going to be blocking someone's view.
FireflyFestival,39y1wd,photogenicusername,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:51:30 2015 UTC,"And that's the thing. I understand that you're tall and you can't help it.  I have no problem with that if you're a nice guy. But he was a dick about it. If he pushed in to us to get where he ended, I'm sure he shoved a lot of other people."

FireflyFestival,39y1wd,Pulp_Ficti0n,4,Wed Jun 17 19:00:02 2015 UTC,I watched a girl record the entire Beck concert on her phone last year. While on top of some guy's shoulders. Don't be that person.

Remember to not be afraid to link arms with people who have been waiting with you, or even strangers, to prevent these pushers from getting through."
FireflyFestival,39y1wd,PapShmear,3,Mon Jun 15 21:22:44 2015 UTC,Its always funny when this happens. I've gotten into shouting matches with people trying to push through and have used the arm linking technique. Sometimes in the heat of the moment I'll get pissed at crowd pushers.

FireflyFestival,3a1hcq,DuhstyDinkleman,2,Tue Jun 16 14:19:34 2015 UTC,I prefer having everything I need packed up and in the car before a festival. Saving a couple bucks on taxes isn't worth the hassle of finding a liquor/beer store in DE. I want to get in line ASAP and get to the camp site.
FireflyFestival,3a1hcq,Jones_Bones,2,Tue Jun 16 15:44:46 2015 UTC,"I'm buying in DE because:   we barely have any room in the car and that means more leg room for longer, and  the beer I love isn't sold in my home state, but IS in DE (super excited!)"
FireflyFestival,3a1hcq,lucy42,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:24:32 2015 UTC,What beer?
FireflyFestival,3a1hcq,Glittrsweet,2,Wed Jun 17 00:35:54 2015 UTC,Fat Tire. Not sold anywhere in New England. :(
FireflyFestival,3a1hcq,lucy42,2,Wed Jun 17 02:45:31 2015 UTC,"Stop in DE but well before Dover. Depending on which way you're coming try to stop right after you cross the state line. Anywhere closer to firefly will start getting crazy. If you're coming 301 it may already be a little crazy down there. If you're coming from 95 south take your first exit for newark and stop at state line liqours, technically it's in md so you do pay taxes but the selection is great there."

It's definitely going to be a pain to stop in Dover by the campgrounds, so I'd absolutely get it before getting in that area."
FireflyFestival,3a1hcq,kmbob13,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:34:49 2015 UTC,"I live in Cincinnati. We made the mistake of waiting until we were at the Walmart in Dover to get beer. They didn't sell it. Found a liquor store near the grounds when we are waiting in the line of traffic to get in, which didn't open until 10. My poor fiance had to stand in line for them to open, then walk with 3 cases of beer and find me in the line of cars. This year we are definitely buying it here and bringing it! Definitely going to bring some local beers too."
FireflyFestival,3a1hcq,burlewkm,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:59:26 2015 UTC,How far is the closest beer or liquor store from the camp grounds?
FireflyFestival,3a1hcq,Scrappydo93,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:41:49 2015 UTC,less then a mile depending on your campsite....there 2 within walking distance.
FireflyFestival,3a1hcq,gar187er,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:02:11 2015 UTC,"If you need to make a run to the liquor store, my suggestion is to pay one of the rickshaw guys to give you a lift.  The walk there isn't bad, but walking back with hands full of beer sucks! I had a guy give me a lift for $10 last year...best decision I made all day."
FireflyFestival,3a1hcq,kmbob13,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:25:28 2015 UTC,If I know someone who is paying for overnight parking are they allowed to leave (to get alcohol or other things) and come back in?
FireflyFestival,3a1hcq,Scrappydo93,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:12:37 2015 UTC,From the FAQ section on the website:  In/out privileges ARE granted with the Overnight Parking Pass. Everyone in the vehicle will need to have his or her Firefly wristband on and ready to show before entry to the parking lot. All vehicles are subject to a thorough search.

FireflyFestival,39y42b,HistoryMachine,38,Mon Jun 15 19:08:04 2015 UTC,"To answer your specific questions:   Bugs are not a problem. The security situation is good.  Cars have never been searched entering camping.  Just a typical security checkpoint at the festival gates (metal detector/bag check).  Cops inside the festival are laid-back and friendly.  Arrests are extremely rare. Drugs are not as common at Firefly as some of the other camping festivals. But there are plenty around. Food is typical for a major festival.  Some good, some not so good.  There are enough food vendors, and lines are usually short. There are free water stations, but lines were long last year at the station near the Main Stage.  I'd recommend using the water station by the Forest Stage instead. Each food item usually costs between $5 - $10.  For example, a slice of pizza would be $5.  A burger and fries would be closer to $10. Beer is roughly $8.  Bud Light is sold all over the festival grounds.  Don't miss the Dogfish Head Brewery tent (near the Main Stage) for craft beer plus air conditioning. Porta-potties are plentiful and cleaned frequently. In the campgrounds, they're grouped together in central locations, so you might have a fairly long walk to the nearest one. Showers are $5 per use.  They're located in the Hubs."
FireflyFestival,39y42b,SteveBDel,8,Mon Jun 15 19:27:16 2015 UTC,"First of all, you should be a mod here, you are always so helpful and nice about giving information!  And I have follow up questions: 1) can you only get Dogfish Head beer in that specific tent? (I am not planning on drinking Bud Light, yuck.) and 2) are there long lines for showers or is that mitigated by them charging people money to shower? I've never been to a festival where the showers aren't free!"
FireflyFestival,39y42b,lucy42,6,Mon Jun 15 20:13:24 2015 UTC,"Aww, thanks. :)  1 - Yeah, Dogfish Head is only available in The Brewery tent.  I think that's part of Firefly's contract with Budweiser. The good news: The Dogfish Head tent will be much bigger this year.  Dogfish will have 8 beers on tap, including Firefly Ale.  2 - The shower lines are mitigated somewhat by the $5 charge.  If you can go early in the morning, lines aren't bad.  Late morning is the worst time."
FireflyFestival,39y42b,SteveBDel,3,Mon Jun 15 21:22:10 2015 UTC,"Dogfish Head has in the past only been avaiable in the Dogifsh tent. They will offer about 7 different type of beer, including their special Firefly Ale."
FireflyFestival,39y42b,TheBopper00,2,Mon Jun 15 20:53:50 2015 UTC,"Last time i went there was only Heineken, is that different now?"
FireflyFestival,39y42b,YoungCrabman,3,Mon Jun 15 22:14:49 2015 UTC,"Well, Dogfish Head has always been available at the Brewery tent.  But Heineken was the primary beer sponsor in 2013.  Bud Light replaced them for 2014/2015, so Heineken is no longer available."
FireflyFestival,39y42b,SteveBDel,3,Mon Jun 15 22:18:39 2015 UTC,Cheers.
FireflyFestival,39y42b,YoungCrabman,15,Mon Jun 15 22:19:43 2015 UTC,"Bring wet wipes with you everywhere.  Don't get stressed about missing acts, its gonna happen.  Just have a couple each day that you MUST see and make sure you get there a little early.  Check out the late night EDM acts even if you aren't into that music.  If you have never experienced a festival edm show, its something you simply have to do haha.  Make friends with your camping neighbors from the start.  That way, if they are being super loud at night or bothering you, you can politely ask them to rein it in a bit without starting a scene.  That being said, this is a CAMPING MUSIC FESTIVAL.  People are here, sometimes from very far, to hang out with there friends and have fun.  Not to sleep.  So just be prepared.  I suggest bringing earplugs, you can get some for like $2, in case your neighbors are loud.  Do not forget to drink water.  Its gonna be hot and when you're drinking or partaking all day you can easily just forget.  Camelpaks are great.  Fill your Camelpak with water and then ask the beer cart guys for a handful of ice and put that it, it feels soooo good to have a cold pak on and your friends will love you.  Be careful buying drugs from people in the campsites.  2 years ago I got scammed out of $100 because I was so locked into the friendly festival vibe I wasn't thinking clearly and just assumed this guy was legit.  Last and most important, HAVE AN OPEN MIND.  Take some time in the grounds and just wander around to whatever sounds good.  I have discovered many great artists this way."
FireflyFestival,39y42b,sp0ck06,5,Mon Jun 15 19:47:24 2015 UTC,"I was never into EDM before I saw Big Gigantic at FF two years ago. It seriously was such an amazing experience, that I really started getting into EDM shortly there after"

FireflyFestival,39y42b,mgrin88,10,Thu Jun 18 05:07:15 2015 UTC,"This will be my 2nd Firefly and I've done Bonnaroo 3 times. The camelbak is my best friend at festivals. It's great for staying hydrated and also carrying important stuff in zippered pocking so that shit doesn't bounce out while your dancing like a lunatic. Even if you're not thirsty, keep drinking water, especially if you are partaking in any type of recreational goodies. Try to vary up your diet, it sucks having somach and toilet issues in this environment (I am not going to just eat grilled cheeses and clif bars all day again). Sleep is powerful and a luxury, the sun will often bake you in your tent in the morning so staying up all night is short sighted. Lastly, 8 bucks for a bud light SUCKS, I've found the best deal is the Midas Touch at the Dogfish Head tent. It's a very tasty and unqiue brew, and at 9% abv it'll give you a good buzz for only costing a buck or two more than a bud."
FireflyFestival,39y42b,Radjage,3,Mon Jun 15 22:05:51 2015 UTC,2nd the midas touch. Best bang for your buck. Budlight isn't terrible especially if its the 16oz can
FireflyFestival,39y42b,lammnub,2,Tue Jun 16 00:06:19 2015 UTC,I enjoyed my second bonnaroo this year and am happy to be going to firefly as well. I was curious since there is a police presence that isn't at bonnaroo and that I am not quite 21 yet would I be hassled drinking beer/liquor at my campsite or walking to the woodlands?
FireflyFestival,39y42b,dropanadambomb,4,Tue Jun 16 01:33:13 2015 UTC,"No. In the campgrounds, cops just drive through occasionally.  They don't stop unless you give them a reason to.  No one is walking around checking IDs.  And everyone drinks on the walk from camping to the festival entrance. The cops don't care at all.  Again, no one gets stopped unless they're causing trouble."
FireflyFestival,39y42b,SteveBDel,3,Tue Jun 16 03:02:30 2015 UTC,"oh, my, god. The difference I found was HUGE. I was super concerned about security from my experience at Bonnaroo. At Firefly, it is so much more chill for the better (as far as security, there are definitely more bros and less hippies at Firefly) . They didn't search my car at all, unlike Roo where they basically tear it apart. The people who check your bags were basically really strict on Thursday and then really cool the rest of the time, unlike Roo where they are for sure more aggressive. I think you'll have a fine time being able to drink openly and on your walk to the entrance, like most things, I'd only be concerned if you draw excessive attention to yourself/be obnoxious."
FireflyFestival,39y42b,Radjage,2,Tue Jun 16 03:34:52 2015 UTC,Anything that happens inside the premises is pretty much fair game. Don't get out of hand and you can get away with most things.
FireflyFestival,39y42b,YoungCrabman,9,Tue Jun 16 12:52:11 2015 UTC,Bring a hose. There are spigots that people awkwardly try to shower under. A hose makes this a million times easier. I could have made a fortune charging $1/min for the hose last year if I wanted to.
FireflyFestival,39y42b,irndk10,5,Mon Jun 15 23:27:49 2015 UTC,"THIS is what I'm talking about! Good on you, sir."

You'll probably see people trying to shower under them, but they're like 18"" off the ground pointing downward so you pretty much have to be in pushup position to get under it. A hose makes it super easy. I warn you though, you have to be an asshole at some point. Crowds will gather and line up to use it."
FireflyFestival,39y42b,sp0ck06,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:13:00 2015 UTC,"they're scattered around the campgrounds, usually near the main dirt roads.  i didnt use them to shower but i find one every morning and wash my hair, feels AMAZING haha"
FireflyFestival,39y42b,randomname04,10,Tue Jun 16 22:14:57 2015 UTC,"Bring Pedialyte! You can buy it for $5 at Target/Giant. This was our groups life saver last year. Drink some before bed and right when you wake up in the morning.  This is just a good tip for anyone who enjoys consuming several adult beverages.  Enjoy your time with friends, get off your phones and meet new friends! You will meet friends you will speak with until next Firefly."
FireflyFestival,39y42b,RohypnolRomance,4,Tue Jun 16 01:25:31 2015 UTC,I second the pedialyte. Coconut water works just as good too. It has a lot of potassium in it which is ideal for hangovers.
FireflyFestival,39y42b,darksideofdagoon,7,Tue Jun 16 01:36:55 2015 UTC,"I've been there the past 3 years, so firefly is my only music fest experience. The food is fine, but I try to bring in everything I can for myself to save money, and plus whatever you bring is probably better than what you'll buy there in my opinion. Beer is $8 16oz, Dogfish head is pretty much $10. I don't remember bugs being an issue, but it was dry most of the festival last year and the year before.   Security within the festival is almost not noticable unless you're near a barrier. Security to get in the festival varies greatly from person to person. I would recommend not trying to put any party favors in a cigarette box, they like to check those for some reason. Firefly, the festival as a whole, seems to not be as big into drugs, but this year is unique, because there are a lot of EDM acts going on, so it might be a different situation.   Biggest tip: Get everything you need from your campsite so you don't have to go back to it. It just isn't realistic to expect to walk back, even if you have Wed. Premier camping."
FireflyFestival,39y42b,P4RANOID,2,Tue Jun 16 00:05:28 2015 UTC,"Personally I never had any problems with sneaking stuff in with a cigarette box. Granted it was one innocuous joint in a near full pack, but still. I got patted down every day and they never checked my cigs."
FireflyFestival,39y42b,billion_billion,10,Tue Jun 16 04:30:17 2015 UTC,"The food is delicious and reasonable, with a large variety in the festival. I generally ate breakfast at camp, then everything else inside. Water is accessible, but there will be lines just before/after shows nearby, so try to walk to the next station if its on the way. beer was something like $7 for a 16oz can. They sell redbulls for like $3 if you bring in liquor you can make your own drinks. If you start to overheat, check out the brewery. Only place with A/C at the woodlands. Drugs: don't act a fool and you'll be fine. Smuggle in booze if you can, in plastic containers. They don't really search your person but they do wand you.   Biggest hurdles are the heat and, last year, the dust. I've heard they have better grass, but bringing a bandana wouldn't hurt. Lastly, look for the campsite with the yellow smiley face flag. Our group is always willing to shotgun beers with new friends. Good luck!"

What's the situation when it comes to a grocery store for food to cook? Walking distance? No re-entry? I assume it's not allowed for a person to drive off into Dover and drive back to their camp site.
FireflyFestival,39y42b,SteveBDel,3,Mon Jun 15 23:29:28 2015 UTC,"Correct about no vehicle re-entry.  There's a general store in the campgrounds (overpriced, of course) and a farmers' market.  If you're willing to walk off-site, there's an Acme grocery store within walking distance of General Camping.  See this map: http://i.imgur.com/OlToaWb.jpg"

FireflyFestival,39y42b,CHH4,5,Tue Jun 16 12:57:05 2015 UTC,"Know when to take a rest during the day. Last year me and my group went hard on Friday. Not only from partying, but from all the walking. Because of that a few of us crashed early and missed the Foo Fighters. If you are camped on the outer reaches of General Camping you are walking 30-45 minutes just to get into the festival. Use the shaded areas, drink plenty of water or just pop a squat in the grass every now and then. Recharging your batteries is key, especially if you are trying to go all night."
FireflyFestival,39y42b,CHH4,4,Mon Jun 15 20:54:54 2015 UTC,"Get an extra campsite so you can make sure you have a canopy especially if you are doing Wednesday camping, there is no shade in the camping areas and the heat can be rough.   Dogfish head beers offer more bang for your buck but can hit you hard with the dehydration that can come with being outside for a couple days. Make sure you are hydrating, you don't want to black out and/or be hungover.  Don't try psychedelics for the first time, even if you have experiences with different drugs. It might go well or it might go terribly and ruin a day for you.   Bring a camelpak or off brand version. The water lines were long and inconvenient for only filling a bottle.  Dress comfortably and how you want. If you want to follow trends, go for it! If you want to be comfy and less fashionable do it! It's your festival experience, make it what you want it to be"

FireflyFestival,39y42b,speaklouderpls,2,Tue Jun 16 02:04:41 2015 UTC,"One thing that I don't think has been mentioned already - if you have a pop up canopy/tent, Tapestries are clutch to tie on the sides to block the sun when you're trying to catch some shade."
FireflyFestival,39y42b,watergate_1983,3,Tue Jun 16 02:22:13 2015 UTC,"Take every opportunity for shade that you can get. Firefly takes place around the solstice so that means there's really only around eight hours the sun isn't up and baking you, and if you stay out for the late night acts you've got about three hours before it rises and wakes you up in the morning. Bring a shade pop-up if you have one and position so it covers your tent in the mornings if you don't want to be woken up early. Also apply sunscreen liberally. God, I sound like a parent."
FireflyFestival,39y42b,strudeau1,2,Tue Jun 16 00:49:52 2015 UTC,"In my opinion the bathrooms were fairly clean. Sometimes there were lines near the most accessible bathrooms, but if you just walked a little further down there would be open, less used ones (I guess because people usually just go in the one closest to them)."
FireflyFestival,39y42b,Jones_Bones,2,Mon Jun 15 20:04:25 2015 UTC,Gold bond and compression shorts go a long way. Also last year a lot of people smuggled airplane bottles of booze into the festival grounds so keep that in mind if you want to drink. Camelbaks are awesome but not required. I just wear a normal backpack with 2 large bottles of water in the pockets and drink as much as I can. Sunscreen hats sunglasses and bandanas should be on everyone's list. If you don't have one already a tall tailgating flag or some identifying marker makes it much easier to find your campsite while intoxicated. I'd also recommend eating clean as much as possible. Your body is going to hate you already. I'm taking a bunch of fresh produce including apples oranges bananas and corn on the cob as well as granola and single use almond milk packages that don't need refrigeration. Also I recommend one of those battery charger pods so that if your phone dies in the fest and you get separated it won't be a big deal.
FireflyFestival,3a0ow3,SmokesLetsG0,3,Tue Jun 16 08:50:07 2015 UTC,"1) No unless you lose your wristband and need to replace it. But I'm sure you could confirm things another way.   2) It depends on your mood/how much you want to walk/how close you want to be for certain acts. If you're ok with chilling towards the back you could hit 10 in a day. If you want to be closer, you may only get 4-5 in but you'll have better spots.   3) Also depends, if you're really keeping you eyes peeled you can usually find what you're looking for. Using social mediums like reddit and yikyak can help streamline the process.   4) Silent disco is cool (I'd recommend the live DJs/artists though. You can listen to your headphones anytime :)"

FireflyFestival,3a051y,NicholasDe,4,Tue Jun 16 04:44:06 2015 UTC,"A festival is exactly what you make of it  Honestly, although it seems like most poeple go in big groups of like 10 people to music festivals, in my experience I think its more enjoyable going in smaller groups of less than 5 people. In my experiences, going in larger groups usually results in conflict (people wanting to see different shows, some people getting too fucked up and ruining it for other people, trying to keep a large group all together in a big crowd etc...) I like going in a small group of GOOD friends who you know you can have a good time with and get fucked up with and still keep it together  Again, meeting people is all up to you. Drink some beer with your neighbors and the people around you, everyone is there to have a good time and meet poeple. Meeting people isnt hard at all as long as youre open to it  Tips on what to bring? Could make a huge list, but im sure you have all the big things covered (tent, chairs, cooler, etc...) One thing I would recomend is wet wipes to wipe the dirt off yourself and a couple gallons of water. You CAN pay to shower there but I would rather spend my money on other things while im there so i bring gallons of water use them as a ghetto shower. Not quite like the real thing but hoenstly after a night of partying and sweating rinsing off with a gallon of water and some body wash is SO refreshing."

Music festivals are different for everyone.  For your first time, just go with the flow and enjoy the experience.  The only thing that can really ruin a music festival is physical pain, so be as prepared as possible. Drinking water is the most important thing.  Don't forget a reusable water bottle or Camelbak.  You'll be on your feet and walking all day, so wear sturdy, comfortable shoes.  With all the walking, chafing can be a big problem.  You can prevent that with Body Glide or Gold Bond Friction Defense.  Sunscreen is an obvious essential, but remember to re-apply it frequently. Also bring a bandanna for dust, and a poncho for rain.  In the campgrounds, make sure you bring something for shade -- either a tarp or a canopy.  The sun can be brutal.  If you forget to bring something, you can find almost anything on-site.  Don't stress.  Festivals are fun. :)"

FireflyFestival,39yt1b,chippersan,2,Mon Jun 15 22:41:02 2015 UTC,"When you fill your cooler use mostly ice and little water.  Then pour salt on the ice in the cooler, it will cause a reaction which makes the temperature colder than freezing."
FireflyFestival,39yt1b,The_Iron_Zeppelin,-6,Tue Jun 16 03:40:44 2015 UTC,Are you loco? Pouring salt on ice makes it melt at a lower temperature... No reaction occurs... Ice that melts at a lower temperature means the ice melts faster.  Source: high school education
FireflyFestival,39yt1b,RedditUser332,6,Tue Jun 16 04:29:47 2015 UTC,"The salt will melt some of the ice, but the salt also gets everything colder.  When salt is added to water it allows the water to get to a lower temperature without freezing.  By adding salt to a cooler of Ice water, you allow the ice to lower the water temp. to below the normal freezing point.  The now sub-zero water surrounding your beverages is able to cool them faster.    An Actual Source:  https://stuffexplained.wordpress.com/2012/08/06/adding_salt_to_ice_in_a_cooler/"
FireflyFestival,39yt1b,The_Iron_Zeppelin,-3,Tue Jun 16 04:47:18 2015 UTC,"You are not making any more ""cold"" when you add salt, you are simply making the ice melt at a lower temperature. The next part about this is temperature gradients... So adding salt does not change the amount of ""cold"" in the cooler but each time you open the cooler more heat is transferred out of it because of the bigger temperature gradient. If you want sub 0 beer, add ice. If you want your beer to stay cold for a long period of time, no salt."
FireflyFestival,39yt1b,RedditUser332,2,Tue Jun 16 14:15:33 2015 UTC,"I don't know the science haha but i do know that adding salt makes the beer get cold significantly faster, I have done this hundreds of times"
FireflyFestival,39yt1b,sp0ck06,3,Tue Jun 16 16:13:26 2015 UTC,"But ice has empty pockets of air between each cube which are warmer causing the beverage to not get as cold as it can.  Adding water with your ice fills in those gaps and allows the cold water to cover the surface area of the container.  Adding salt allows the water to get colder than the ice allowing a faster chill for your drinks.  The ice that the salt melts is still just as cold, the salt just allows it to remain liquid at a colder temperature.    I'm not making this stuff up, you can check for yourself online, there are multiple sources that back it up.  I think Myth Busters even did an episode about it which is how I originally heard about it."
FireflyFestival,39yt1b,The_Iron_Zeppelin,2,Tue Jun 16 14:28:28 2015 UTC,"All I am saying is that salting your ice will NOT make your beer stay cold for a longer period of time. Yes, adding salt will cause the beer to be colder and all that means is a bigger temperature gradient causing more of the ""cold"" in your cooler to be released each time it is opened. The OP never asked how to cool his beer the fastest possible way..."

FireflyFestival,39yt1b,nattychom,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:12:24 2015 UTC,Ice is more expensive at the hub than the real world but it's not all that bad especially when you compare it to all the other expenses involved.  A bag a day is probably enough and ~$25 [total for the weekend] split between the people sharing the cooler is small compared to the price of the tickets and stuff.

Also if you can bring a canopy so you have a place to hang out in the rain and you're not stuck in your tent or car. Try to keep your clothes in your car in case your tent does spring a leak.

FireflyFestival,39z9c2,billion_billion,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:31:43 2015 UTC,Try staples. I believe they can print a custom outdoor banner and you can pick it up same day.
FireflyFestival,39z9c2,Vagrantmonarch,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:25:27 2015 UTC,Go to FedEx Office. They can print and laminate large sizes while you wait. Might cost you a decent amount though.
FireflyFestival,39z9c2,Vagrantmonarch,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:05:30 2015 UTC,Spray paint and a old sheet/pillow case and use a grey scale for him so it's black and white probably the easiest now at this point.
FireflyFestival,39z7cn,nyvalley24,2,Mon Jun 15 23:53:24 2015 UTC,First time for me too.  But from what I gather there might be a few small bands playing at the hub and mostly everyone will be setting up getting to know people and partying. As for the getting their stuff there it might be a pain but should be possible.
FireflyFestival,39z7cn,Vagrantmonarch,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:13:51 2015 UTC,And I'll look for your flag just to see how you all made out.

FireflyFestival,39z59i,summerstate,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:11:09 2015 UTC,Is it carefree or regular?
FireflyFestival,39z47x,jlevin18,2,Mon Jun 15 23:28:20 2015 UTC,Friday is definitely late and you'll get a pretty bad camping spot. Think overflow camping at Roo. Campsites are usually good with portapotties. No sinks like the pods at Roo but each hub has a water refill place.  Firefly is definitely a younger crowd and will be more pushy. People will always be camping out for the barrier so it's tough to get a good spot and even if you wait it out you will most likely get pushed out of the way.   Parking pass thing is totally false. Come in together or you won't be together.  Good luck! Roo this past weekend was great and I feel like firefly will not be able to compare.
FireflyFestival,39z47x,lammnub,-7,Tue Jun 16 00:16:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah I would never ever go to firefly if I hadnt won tickets, I feel like it's gonna be a massive disappointment but hey free tickets."

FireflyFestival,39xjlq,brandeauxn,2,Mon Jun 15 16:46:14 2015 UTC,"You can probably be dropped off at day parking, if not then by the casino (opposite side of the racetrack). Decent hike but not bad if you're traveling light. Worst case you can hop out on Dupont Hwy (Rt 13) at Lepesic. Very difficult if they don't help you out. There are camping ""addresses"" for each row, and the camping areas are marked on the firefly maps by name. Have them identify the lot on the map, then find the name of the row they're on (usually at the end). Finally, either have a flag or something at your site or have them meet you at a recognizable location. Might have enough service to call but we had to text people last year. Won't get searched, just don't be sketchy. Good luck!"

If you have an overnight parking pass, you can take the shuttle to the hub, but it sounds like you don't have one.

FireflyFestival,39xbsr,Pulp_Ficti0n,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:07:47 2015 UTC,"There's a bunch of real good perks. My GF likes the air conditioned bathrooms. But my favorite part is you can go to a band in the middle of their set, and get a pretty good view right away. You can also lie down on the grass, and still see them. The VIP loft by the main stage is sweet, it's at stage level so you can see what the artists see. Never have a water issue in VIP, there's like unlimited water bottles. The Backyard, the porch, and the lawn are all connected in VIP, so it's much easier to go from stage to stage. You could even go from stage to stage in the middle of sets, and still get great views.   I've done GA the first two years, I loved it. After doing VIP last year, I'm pretty sure I'm done with GA.  The one negative: the people, they're mostly an older crowd. Sometimes there's kids there, like real young kids. It seems like most VIP's aren't as into the acts as much as GA's. There is practically no drug scene at VIP, if that's your thing."

FireflyFestival,39v58y,jojo_mill,2,Mon Jun 15 17:43:32 2015 UTC,"She flashed the crowd at least, for a split second you got to see everything. But she also flashed the crowd at several other shows/festivals as part of the freethenipple campaign, so I'm pretty sure she will at FireFly"
FireflyFestival,39v58y,MSUlander,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:24:18 2015 UTC,"Ah, from my spot it didn't seem that she showed it all but that's awesome she did!"

FireflyFestival,39v58y,SteveBDel,7,Mon Jun 15 19:06:27 2015 UTC,Drink water all day. Stick to the shade between sets. Hat + sunscreen. Do what you would normally do on a hot day...
FireflyFestival,39v58y,OfTheEarth2,7,Mon Jun 15 02:09:41 2015 UTC,"I'm coming up from Tampa, FL. Sounds like a nice cool weekend to me.   Seriously though, drink a gallon of non alcoholic beverage a day so you don't pass out."
FireflyFestival,39v58y,Twisky,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:22:14 2015 UTC,Lol same. Went up last year from South Florida. The weather is nothing like here. It's like 100 times less humid and by 5-6 pm it gets pretty cool at night(in Delaware that is).
FireflyFestival,39v58y,longshotz38,3,Mon Jun 15 04:15:41 2015 UTC,i bought a fan
FireflyFestival,39v58y,kaiterdacreator,2,Mon Jun 15 03:18:11 2015 UTC,"Stay hydrated!     Bring a bandana, keep it wet, tie it to your head. Put some ice cubes inside of that shit at the beginning of the day.     Wear light colors. Wear light clothing.     Like somebody said, it's a marathon, not a race. Save your alcohol drinking for when the sun goes down. You'll wanna make it to the end of the day!     I've never actually been to FF, but this worked for me out in the desert at coachella."
FireflyFestival,39v58y,dr7164,2,Mon Jun 15 15:44:14 2015 UTC,Manks and Dadbods that's the style for FF 2015. You heard it here first.
FireflyFestival,39v58y,6r1nch,5,Mon Jun 15 06:54:13 2015 UTC,Oh we were talking about physically staying cool? like ice cubes in the sahara?   bro. these aren't real worries. You have all night to cool down.
FireflyFestival,39v58y,6r1nch,1 point,Mon Jun 15 06:55:09 2015 UTC,"Water, rest, shade!  Pour some water on a bandana and put it on your neck for a while. Hydrate! Find shade to sit down in during some down time.   It's a marathon, not a race."
FireflyFestival,39wuhf,madeinamerika_,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:26:48 2015 UTC,There will absolutely be other people there who will have Kandi up for trade :) Just a couple more days!!!!!
FireflyFestival,39wuhf,amberlylou,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:49:20 2015 UTC,Ahh yes! I can't wait!
FireflyFestival,39wuhf,cdrago,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:36:04 2015 UTC,"I won't be wearing mine for most of the fest, but I may pop on the meaningful ones for Zedd."
FireflyFestival,39tghg,JoeAdkins,4,Sun Jun 14 16:45:21 2015 UTC,Don't know about shrooms. I don't pay over $10 a hit for Lucy. What do you usually charge for Molly?
FireflyFestival,39tghg,rhifooshwah,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:54:29 2015 UTC,10 a point and 300 an 8th
FireflyFestival,39tghg,ArrSlashDrugs,6,Mon Jun 15 02:40:35 2015 UTC,I hope by acid you mean lsd. If you are selling NBOMe as acid you will be the cause of multiple deaths.
FireflyFestival,39tghg,ArrSlashDrugs,7,Sun Jun 14 17:01:01 2015 UTC,I do mean LSD.
FireflyFestival,39tghg,Deriksson,4,Sun Jun 14 17:09:38 2015 UTC,Okay cool. Most people around here won't pay over 10 a tab. Shrooms you can probably get away with 45 and Molly most likely also 10 a point.
FireflyFestival,39tghg,L1eutenantDan,3,Sun Jun 14 17:18:02 2015 UTC,"Awesome, that's pretty much the answer I was thinking.  The only thing I was unclear on was the shrooms but these boomers are potent so I was wanting to know the ceiling for them."
FireflyFestival,39tghg,ArrSlashDrugs,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:19:40 2015 UTC,"Personally wouldn't pay over 45 an eighth for potent shrooms in my area, however inside the fest you'll definitely get away with 50 if you find people who are desparate"
FireflyFestival,39tghg,ozzy-999,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:34:22 2015 UTC,"Wait wait wait. Deaths? How's that happen? I'm genuinely curious, I took 25i once and it was awesome. Is it just kinda luck of the draw?"
FireflyFestival,39tghg,CouchCrasher,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:37:25 2015 UTC,Yeah. 25x series is extremely variable from person to person more so than other psychs probably due them being full agonists rather than partial agonists. Some people can take 5 tabs and be fine while others can take 1 tab and OD. No one really knows why this is though and I'm no scientist. I'm just repeating the things I learned from /r/drugs
FireflyFestival,39tghg,HaYNguy268,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:46:26 2015 UTC,Will you be therw for premier camping?
FireflyFestival,39tghg,FuckYourTickets,3,Sun Jun 14 16:57:54 2015 UTC,Yes
FireflyFestival,39tghg,6r1nch,2,Sun Jun 14 16:58:19 2015 UTC,"There's gonna be some competition, then. Also a bunch of testers making sure your shit is legit. The molly and acid would go for ten for one or point one."
FireflyFestival,39tghg,HaYNguy268,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:43:48 2015 UTC,Really would be down to buy some L or shrooms at the festival....but its my first time and I'm not really sure how to go about doing so? Any advice?
FireflyFestival,39tghg,Fresnel_diffraction,4,Sun Jun 14 19:40:01 2015 UTC,I would advise against trying psychedelics for the first time at a festival.  Not the most conducive atmosphere for a first trip.
FireflyFestival,39tghg,omnomnomscience,3,Mon Jun 15 01:10:00 2015 UTC,"could be a really hot nurse at the medical tent, you never know"
FireflyFestival,39tghg,realtalkliam,2,Mon Jun 15 06:57:10 2015 UTC,"Sorry I wasn't clear - I've done psychedelics many times before (L about 7 times shrooms only twice), but I've never been to a music festival and was wondering how people obtain such items at such an event :)"
FireflyFestival,39tghg,matrick65,4,Mon Jun 15 21:48:49 2015 UTC,"While setting up camp keep your ears open and listening for someone to say ""doses"" or ""shrooms."" It's nearly impossible to go the first 24 hours you're there with out someone coming through your camp area selling that sort of stuff."
FireflyFestival,39tghg,Nobody-Home,2,Sun Jun 14 20:11:20 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't recommend it at all. I was experienced with acid but not shrooms and took them for the first time Thursday during the day last year. I had a terrible trip mostly because of the heat/dust all the people, and not feeling like it was a good environment for it. Wait until you can do it in a more low key setting."
FireflyFestival,39tghg,sniper123123,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:37:34 2015 UTC,"I did shrooms and molly my first year and had a great trip, And two other first timers had a great time also. If you generally give good vibes and aren't a bad person you should be fine"
FireflyFestival,39tghg,mrbighead77,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:47:05 2015 UTC,"Hey man message me, would like to holla at you weds"
FireflyFestival,39tghg,Grass_Monster,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:02:27 2015 UTC,I wouldn't pay more than 90 clams for a strip.
FireflyFestival,39tghg,saltycakez,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:05:21 2015 UTC,"$10/g of shrooms is the standard where I'm from when they're available, though I've seen people charge as much as $45-50 an 1/8 for some cyanescens when I was in college, cubes usually around $35 though."
FireflyFestival,39tghg,YoungCrabman,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:35:12 2015 UTC,"hello! i would love to grab some of that molly, how can i find u there, or would u be willing to hook it up via private msg with your number or fb"
FireflyFestival,39tghg,Prestonelliot,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:42:30 2015 UTC,"Hey, what's up? How much are you looking for?"
FireflyFestival,39tghg,dropanadambomb,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:47:18 2015 UTC,At bonnaroo last year we got an eighth of boomers for 25 but lots of people were asking up to 40. Also shoot me a pm and I'll track you down Thursday :)
FireflyFestival,39tghg,Sabragg28,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:33:45 2015 UTC,"Awesome to know of someone who will be coming supplied! From what I've heard it's not always easy to track down stuff at FF. think my group would be lookin to grab a g or two of molly and a couple tabs, if you're down to exchange numbers or fb lemme know, and I'd definitely find ya thursday  T-minus 4 days gettin pumped"
FireflyFestival,39tghg,paulhasnoshoes,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:49:47 2015 UTC,Send me a PM
FireflyFestival,39tghg,sjm6bd,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:35:01 2015 UTC,Looking for lucy and shrooms. Will be at premier camping on Wednesday. Pm if we can meet sometime.
FireflyFestival,39tghg,sjm6bd,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:10:28 2015 UTC,How much of each were you looking for?
FireflyFestival,39vcb0,xthunderpumax,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:42:27 2015 UTC,"Its just in case you lose your wrist band you can get a replacement one at Will Call.  It doesn't hurt to do it, but I guess it's technically optional."
FireflyFestival,39vcb0,The_Iron_Zeppelin,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:12:01 2015 UTC,"What is the benefit, or your reasoning, for not doing it?"
