Many Christians deny macroevolution, which would yield the change from single cell to human.  It seems like you believe macroevolution.  Do you believe Adam and Eve were literal?  Do you believe Noah and his family were the only ones to survive the flood?  I don't think these events are compatible with macroevolution, and I believe God and His word (Bible) to be the ultimate source of authority, so I don't believe macroevolution to be true.  If it makes a difference, I'm majoring in cellular and molecular biology and still hold this view."

I think it's possible when God says he made Adam, and made Eve out of his ribs that he could of done this over time, not exactly instantly. I believe that God's process to creating man could have involved starting with one cell and through evolution created man.   Of course I believe God's word to be the ultimate authority and if science changes it won't change my mind about God, but I believe there is a way to assume they coexist."

However the idea that new species of life are created through the process of natural selection is harder to defend. Natural selection can do an excellent job explaining the survival of the fittest but falls short in the creation of new.   Dr. David Berlinski dose a great job explaining this in book the devil's delusion.   Here's a video of him discussing it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XIDykeZplU

Christians,3dwzqh,SoundsLikeGreatFun,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:10:45 2015 UTC,"I'm firmly a believer in a six-day creation, and I think evolution can be disproved on more than blind faith. I think it can be disproved Biblically, scientifically, and logically. I'd like to explain a bit in this comment why I think that.  I don't want to go off on a tangent, but there's a lot of things that macroevolution assumes to be true that just doesn't fit with with what the Bible tells us, especially if you take Adam and Eve literally (which I do as well). First consider this: if Adam and Eve were real people, who exactly were they? If they evolved from single-cell organisms over an extremely long time, at which point of the development of humans were Adam and Eve? Surely in the ancestry tree, Adam and Eve would have siblings or cousins? Why are they not mentioned?  Now consider this contradiction that I find to be the clincher. There would be humans before Adam; the nature of evolution is tiny mutations and changes over time, so Adam's father and mother would be extremely similar to Adam. The Bible mentions how the descendants of Adam sin (since Adam and Eve made the first sin according to Genesis) and Jesus, the ""last Adam"" reverses that by bringing salvation instead of death. This is mentioned a lot by Paul the Apostle (like in Romans 5:14).  However, the Bible also tells us that ""all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God"" (Romans 3:23), so surely Adam's parents were human enough to sin, weren't they? Why aren't they human enough to be truly ""human""? Even worse, at which point can you call something ""human"" and its parents that are only slightly different, not ""human"" and not deserving of God's grace? That to me seems like something a loving God would never do.  Sorry if this post is too wordy. I've carefully studied this stuff since science really interests me and I've personally come to the conclusion that evolution (as secularly described) just really isn't compatible with the Bible. There's other fun things that you can explore too, like cell biology, DNA, and the age of the Earth, etc."

All Christians consist of murderers, adulterers, thieves, etc. All Christians are sinners, and some have committed serious crimes. Some are in jail for them. The difference between a Christian murderer and a non-Christian murderer is that the former turns away from his sin while the latter habitually lives in his sin. So while there's no such thing as a Christian who habitually loves and lives in his sin, the answer is yes of course I'd rather want my child to be a Christian who has done terrible things they've repented (and are repenting) of, rather than an atheist who obeys the laws of man and is under the judgment of God."

Doing something like that would probably indicate the person isn't serious about belief. Again, if my kid were to do something terrible and then repent and not do it again - great.

Christians,3dq2w5,hqppy,10,Sat Jul 18 09:58:09 2015 UTC,"Hello, I am glad that you have gotten away from the occult and depression and decided to choose freedom in Christ. :)  To answer some of your questions:  1)  Question: ""Why did God rest on the seventh day of creation (Genesis 2:2)?""   First, we should quote the verse correctly. It doesn’t say God “needed” to rest; it simply says that He did. Also, it is clear from Scripture that God did not rest because He was tired. Genesis 17:1 calls God the “Almighty God.” Psalm 147:5 says, “Great is our Lord, and mighty in power; His understanding is infinite.” God is all-powerful; He never tires and never needs to rest. As Isaiah 4:28 says, “The everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, neither faints nor is weary.” God is the sum of perfection; He is never diminished in any way, and that includes being diminished in power...The context of Genesis 1–2 strongly affirms the idea of God’s “rest” being a cessation of work, not a reinvigoration after work...God did not merely “rest” on the seventh day; He “stopped creating.” It was a purposeful stop. Everything He desired to create had been made. He looked at His creation, declared it “very good” (Genesis 1:31), and ceased from His activity.    2) If God is omniscient, why did he have to ask Adam questions?    A. God knew where Adam was, but He wanted Adam to take an       inward look at himself.      1. Where are you Adam? His truthful answer should have been:          ""I'm over here hiding because I have sinned against You.""   3a) Did the devil come as a serpent or did the devil use a serpent medium?   It is a valid question. A close look at the texts of Genesis reveals that the serpent was a real serpent, and the devil used it as his medium and spoke through it.  Please notice how the serpent was introduced and whose voice it is: Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? (Genesis 3:1)  The first sentence talks about a real serpent of the field. The next sentence does not say ""it"" said, but rather, ""he"" said. That is a clue that the serpent was only the medium but someone else was speaking through it.  There are people, who believe that serpents were endowed with the power of speech and reason before sin entered the world, and the logic that is cited is-Eve did not express surprise when the serpent spoke and reasoned out things with her! Well, that is not true. Remember Balaam's donkey that spoke?  To further prove that serpents were not endowed with the power of speech is to look at the curse that the Lord pronounced on them.  And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life. (Genesis 3:14)  Two curses are mentioned here. The first-""upon thy belly shalt thou go"". Which means it was not going on its belly before. It was probably flying, as Isaiah talks about a ""fiery flying serpent"" (Isaiah 30:6). The second curse was-""Dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life"", which means it was not eating dust before. If serpents were speaking before, then why aren't they speaking now? If they had this ability to speak before, and that  bility was removed, why doesn't the Bible mention that? We see nothing of the removal of the power of speech in the curses pronounced on it.   3b) Was it fair for God to curse the serpent which was only a medium? Wasn't it innocent?    We need to realize that not only the medium of the devil was cursed but the entire creation on planet earth suffered. God told Adam:  Cursed is the ground for thy sake. (Genesis 3:17)  And Paul wrote:  For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now. (Romans 8:22)   3c) Why did God permit the devil to use a medium?    Well, the devil has to be given a fair chance to play his tricks. God had to permit him to use his methods in this Great War. If God cuts off his powers then the Satan would have accused God of monopoly in this great drama of life.   4a) If Adam and Eve were perfect and made in God's Image, why did they sin? (Genesis 1:27)   Free will. God did not create robots. Additionally, they were not ""gods"", only made in the likeness of God.  John Wesley mentions this commentary: Let us make man in our image, and let him have dominion. As he has the government of the inferior creatures, he is as it were God's representative on earth. Yet his government of himself by the freedom of his will, has in it more of God's image, than his government of the creatures.  Note: No where in scriptures it mention that man has a knowing of the past, present, and future.   4b) Can God make mistakes?   Unlike man, God does not make mistakes. He also knows the past, the present, and the future.   As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him. (Psalms 18:30)  And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose. (Romans 8:28)  I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.  (Revelation of John 1:8)   5) Can I not believe the Bible and still be a Christian?   While it is possible to be saved and have doubts about the Bible, it is crucially important that we take God's word's literally. Otherwise false conversion, and backsliding are more or less imminent. One cannot survive without food. In the same way, one cannot grow and survive spiritually without being fed from the Word of God.  Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him.  Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.  (Proverbs 30:5-6)  Is not my word like as a fire? saith the LORD; and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces? (Jeremiah 23:29)  But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. (Matthew 4:4)  Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth. (John 17:17)  All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.

Christians,3dq2w5,fetch04,4,Sat Jul 18 18:13:00 2015 UTC,"Firstly, your life story is very encouraging, and it is obvious from your testimony that God is working in your heart. Secondly, your questions aren't stupid at all, so let me try to answer them:   1- If god is prefect, why do he have to rest the 7th day ?   The Hebrew word Shabath literally means ""to cease."" It doesn't necessarily imply tiredness or fatigue. In fact, the Jewish Sabbath laws commanded the Jews to cease from their work on the Sabbath day, regardless of whether or not they were tired. So when the Bible says God rested, it just means he ceased/stopped His work of creation. He saw that it was very good and so He was finished with it.   2- If god is perfect why do he have to ask ""where are you Adam ?"" When Adam had eaten the fruit. He should know where he is, no?   God does this all the time throughout the Scriptures. For example, when the Lord confronted Saul about murdering Christians in Acts 9, He asked Saul the question, ""Saul, why are you persecuting me?"" Now if God knows all things, He certainly would know why Saul was persecuting Christians, but God does this because He interacts with humans in a relational way that we can understand as humans. Another way to think about it is that we ask these sorts of rhetorical questions all the time, in order to hold people accountable or confront them. I ask my children when they sin, ""Why have you done this?"" even though I know that the reason is because they chose to sin in their hearts. But asking them this question gives them the opportunity to confess their sin.   3- Another thing, the snake talk to eve and when he was punished he was forced to crawl and eat dirt, so we can think -okay the serpent (before the punition) probably had legs, and a mouth capable of speaking... Isn't that a big punition to loose the use of words ? +why god created him in the first place ?   This is an excellent question and there is a great deal of mystery present. However, one thing we can observe in the Bible is that God often performed great acts of punishment to show the seriousness and terribleness of sin. For example, when David committed adultery with Bathsheba, God punished David severely by killing His firstborn son and promising that bloodshed would never leave his family. This is a very severe punishment and difficult to understand, but by these examples we learn just how serious sin is before God. We also learn that the consequences of sin are terrible. The apostle Paul remarked on how Christians are to learn from God's punishment of the Israelites for their sin when he wrote in 1 Corinthians 10, ""Now these things took place as examples for us, that we might not desire evil as they did. "" (1 Corinthians 10:6) So we can understand the punishment of the serpent somewhat, but there is still mystery. You may also be interested to read Bible scholar Dr. Kruger's remarks on this passage here.  As to why God created the serpent, again there is mystery, but throughout the Bible God creates or raises up certain people or animals to play specific roles in His plans. For example, in John 9 we learn about a man whom God had caused to be born blind in order that He could display a mighty work through him. The disciples however thought that he was born blind because of his mother or father's sin. Their lack of understanding shows that we as humans cannot understand the secret will of God. We may not be able to understand everything that He does, but we can still learn about His character and what He expects of us. In Isaiah 55, it says that God's ways and thoughts are not our ways and thoughts. God is incomprehensibly complex and mysterious. We can only know a little bit about Him from the Bible, but even in the Bible, many things we must leave to mystery.   4- God created Adam and Eve to ""His Image"" but they do the mistake while eating the fruit, that mean God can make mistakes too ?   Yes, God created Adam an Eve in His image, but He also created them with the ability to choose between right and wrong. He created us as truly free agents with free will. He created Adam and Eve with a sinless nature, whose hearts were inclined to worship God, but they were not created as robots, just like God is not a robot. So they had the true ability, like God, to choose between right and wrong. If they did not have that ability, then they would not have true free will.   I know theses questions seems really stupids, but I need to understand what I read if I want to loose my Evolutionist education... So there is my last question : 5- Can I be saved if I recognize Jesus as the savior, God as the creator of the Universe, the Holy Spirit, but not the Bible ?   I don't know that I understand your question, but if you are asking if you can be saved without believing that the entire Bible is correct, I would say that as long as you believe in your heart that Jesus Christ of the Bible is your God and Lord, and by faith you trust and follow Him daily by turning away from your sin, you will be saved. That is what is promised in Romans 10. However, I would greatly encourage you to keep studying the things in the Bible that are hard to understand, especially the Old Testament. I have studied the Bible for over 20 years, and there are explanations for all difficulties, but they take time to learn and understand. I have found many mysteries and difficulties in the Bible, but I have not found any errors. As far as Genesis, some professing Christian groups are seeking to turn Genesis into poetry and allegory while embracing evolution, but this does not work. Macroevolution has never been observed in the lab, and it is not compatible with the theology of Scripture, mainly because Jesus and the apostles believed that Adam and Eve were real people. For this area of study I would recommend the materials of Dr. Jonathan Sarfati and associates at creation.com. Also check out the subreddit /r/creation. It is a private subreddit, but /u/joecoder can give you access if you want to ask questions. Many knowledgeable people are there.

We as human have free will and we can be corrupted. God cannot.  5- Since the Bible is the living breath of God, can you accept God but not his word? The Bible is defined at the sword of the Spirit. Do you think you can defend yourself without it in the spiritual realm? Jesus made prophecies happen from the old testament, do you think it's irrelevant? The thing is, the Bible is absolute truth, but like all truths, it's hard to swallow at first. Instead of rejecting the Bible for what it is, why not go deeper in understanding, participate in bible studies online and seek explanation? It can be more rewarding to immediately made up your mind without digging ;)  And you're right about all the new age stuff, this things including Yoga are not good for us, they are opening doors to the demonic realm and allow entities to take over, and we should stay away from them."

Read the New Testament then the old maybe.  The New is certainly easier to get your head around.    The problem is, Jesus seemed to take the Old Testament dead seriously.  So if the living ""Word of God"" treated the OT as the written Word of God, it makes me a little uncomfortable to not at least reserve judgement on something that seems weird to me.

Christians,3dq2w5,Jacksevens,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:37:43 2015 UTC,"Okay first, thank you very much for you'r replies, i will go back on each point, to see if i have understanded your answers correctly.  1 - God Dosen't have to rest at all, but he knew that humans need to, so he pretty much did it to show the symbol of the ""rest day"" to the humans.  2 - God dosen't need to know where Adam is, in fact he acted (i know we can't really understand him) like a fater for exemple, who know that his son has stoled something, but he still ask, did you stoled this ? to confront the child to his decision.  3 - This one is still a little bit tricky to me. What you are saying is that the Devil was controlling the snake, but that God created the devil anyway to separate man from faith, and god gave him tools, such as powers and illusions (i imagine) so he can control the snake.   4 - God created Adam and Eve to his image, but not with his powers, our free will made us sin.  5 - Here i will try to explain better my question, im not rejecting the bible right now, iam reading it, but still you have to understand that i had no religious education with the bible before, all i knew from the bible then, were only citations, movie quotes and things like that. Now that i have to read it while knowing that im suposed to accept everything the Bible says, well its pretty complicated, that basicly mean that i have to forget everything i learned in school, and evolution/Big bang is the big deal.  So i want to read it and understand it clearly.  I have some more question, dont worry these will be the lasts, then i will continue my reading and taking notes, i will ask to go to /creation/ for knowledge.  6- Its about the bible progression, on Genesis, God create the earth, and the stars, is that mean that he created the whole universe ? but there is no mention of the creation of the devil yet, will it be explain later ?  Also in the Bible progression, in Genesis, we see the creation of Mankind, but for exemple, Caïn finds a wife, and build a city, that mean there is already humans that where not mentionned before ?  7 - We know with astronomy that there is some really big stars,(for exemple VY Canis Majoris, that is ~2000x the size of the sun) are they all meaningless ? is that possible that there is some other animal life on other planets ?  In fact, i can't understand why the universe is so big and so huge if there is noway for us to ever being able to reach or even see all of it... Could it be a representation of God himself ?  8 - In Genesis, we can clearly see God's influence on everything that happen to the first humans, punitions, revelations, teachings and much more. But today, there is some greats foes against faith, some people do horrible things, and seems to get away with it. My question is, is that possible that we are in an era, where God dosen't show himself as before, because it could be an era where God want to test us, to see if we can find faith by ourselfes ?  9 - The last one, I promise =D How can you see where are the true messages of God ?  and where are  falses messages FROM the Devil... for exemple, there is some people that believe in Jesus AND practice black magic rituals (one of my friend from Congo) What about the others religions ? Bhouddism ? Islam ?,  are they mistakes made by the humans because of our free-will ? or is it the Devil creation ?  Once again, im really thanksful for your time, and i dont want to abuse of it. I know its hard to answer theses questions, if you have only some references in the bible that can help me, that will still be nice to me =)"
Christians,3dq2w5,QVCatullus,2,Sat Jul 18 17:41:50 2015 UTC,"I'm sure some others will help with some of the other questions you have, but I thought I would take this one:   6- Its about the bible progression, on Genesis, God create the earth, and the stars, is that mean that he created the whole universe ? but there is no mention of the creation of the devil yet, will it be explain later ? Also in the Bible progression, in Genesis, we see the creation of Mankind, but for exemple, Caïn finds a wife, and build a city, that mean there is already humans that where not mentionned before ?   The Devil and his creation are not covered in Genesis. The book of Job contains more information about the creation in a beautiful and poetic style, and includes some of God's discussion with Satan about his being created. Still, there isn't a lot of narrative there about the Devil's backstory. A great deal more is given in the last book of the canon, the Revelation to St. John, which has some more information in chapter 12:    Then another sign appeared in heaven: an enormous red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on his heads. His tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and flung them to the earth... And there was war in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back. But he was not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven. The great dragon was hurled down--that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him.   Jesus has a good bit to say about Satan in the gospels as well, but mostly scattered about, rather than a single passage that explains everything there is to know about Satan.  On Cain's wife, this is a point that is used occasionally to ""prove"" that Genesis shouldn't be taken totally literally, but it's never struck me as very conclusive there. Cain lived a long time, and Adam and Eve surely had more children to people the earth. Starting with only a single pair of human beings means that the first generations would have had to marry close relatives, but it's important to note that God did not establish rules against what we would call incest until much later. Under Mosaic law (the Torah), such would have been forbidden, but God had not established that law yet, partially no doubt because it would have been impossible at the time, since there were no people who were not closely related.   7 - We know with astronomy that there is some really big stars,(for exemple VY Canis Majoris, that is ~2000x the size of the sun) are they all meaningless ? is that possible that there is some other animal life on other planets ? In fact, i can't understand why the universe is so big and so huge if there is noway for us to ever being able to reach or even see all of it... Could it be a representation of God himself ?   I don't see any problem with there being life on other planets. I have no doubt that God could, if He wanted, make life on all the planets he wanted, and reveal himself to all of them, or not, as He wished. Or maybe He didn't -- I don't claim to know the answer, but my gut feeling is that He did.   8 - In Genesis, we can clearly see God's influence on everything that happen to the first humans, punitions, revelations, teachings and much more. But today, there is some greats foes against faith, some people do horrible things, and seems to get away with it. My question is, is that possible that we are in an era, where God dosen't show himself as before, because it could be an era where God want to test us, to see if we can find faith by ourselfes ?   Your thoughts in the last question are almost exactly what I myself mostly think. I think it's important that God does still show himself and help His faithful, but we do not live in a time where the most visible signs from the Old Testament still take place. In the New Testament, Jesus tells the story of a rich man who dies after abusing a poor beggar; the rich man finds himself burned in the fire and asks to go back to Earth and warn his friends, but Jesus says that he and his friends did not believe and repent from the signs they had been given, and would not do so for the sake of one more. We also hear the story of Thomas, one of Jesus's disciples, who is not present to see Jesus when he returns to the rest, and demands to see Jesus and touch his wounded body himself. Jesus tells us that if Thomas is blessed by Christ's return after needing to see and touch, how much more will those be blessed who believe without seeing and touching?"

Christians,3dlm60,Youngwhippersnapper6,4,Fri Jul 17 07:04:38 2015 UTC,"There are three main branches of Christianity: Orthodox, Catholic, and Protestant. There are more than this, but these are the three primary branches in which you'll find most of earth's Christians.  The spiritual (and physical) ancestors of the current members of these three main Churches worshiped under an ecumenical umbrella of sorts. Individual Church communities met in each city, but these were all more or less united under the single banner of 'Christianity.'   The leaders of these individual Churches met seven(-ish) times in the fist millennium of Christian history in councils. Debates, decisions, and elucidations went on at these councils. The fist, and most famous, was the Council of Nicaea. This is where the Nicene Creed was written.  In 1054 the Churches of the East (Constantinople) and the West (Rome) split after hundreds of years of disagreements and strife. The official reason for the split was a clause added to the Nicene-Constantinople Creed stating that the Holy Spirit proceeded from the Father and the Son. The Eastern Churches believed that the Son and the Holy Spirit proceeded from the Father. The Western Churches believed that the Son proceeded from the Father and the Holy Spirit proceeded from the Father through the Son.   The disagreement was much more complicated than that of course. The East resented the growing role of the Roman bishop, the use of unleavened bread in Roman Eucharistic practice (it seemed Jewish to the East), and they were still sore from the Roman Church's iconoclasm in the 8th and 9th centuries.  So the East and the West have split for a thousand years.  The Protestants split from the West (the Roman Catholic Church) in 1517, led by Martin Luther and his complaints about several issues that had arisen in the Catholic Church. Among his reasons for desiring reform: the selling of indulgences to relieve dead relatives of Purgatory, an apparent misunderstanding about justification, the opulence of priests and Church officials in Rome. He intended to reform the Catholic Church but was forced to leave. Nevertheless he carried on worshiping and leading other Christians, becoming the first Protestant pastor.  Others followed in his footsteps and solidified the Protestant Churches of Europe.  In the centuries since, there has never been a unified Protestant Church. This is anyone's guess as to why. Though it seems clear to me that a movement founded on questioning authority will inevitably refuse any such unity or authority. So disagreements about any issue, whether it be creed, theology, practice, music, or political leanings, can lead to a Protestant Church splitting. I've seen Churches split over seemingly small matters.  In the early 20th century, the World Council of Churches was founded as a group committed to unifying Christianity. This was primarily peopled by Protestants at first, though Orthodox eventually joined. The Roman Catholic Church acknowledged them at Vatican II and have cooperated with them since.   The Roman and Orthodox Churches are in the process of apparently reconciling, though no council has been called."
Christians,3dlm60,mickster_island,2,Fri Jul 17 21:33:36 2015 UTC,"What's the difference between denominations?    They have different beliefs about Christianity that were seen as not reconcilable. As usual there might have been some political or geographic reasons behind it.   Why are there so many   Unlike a religion like Islam we were not a dominant religion under a ruler that consolidated beliefs during our first few centuries. Christianity spread through the people as a minority religion and it allowed different interpretations to crop up. Later on, we still can't agree on some issues.   can't there just be one church based around the the Bible's teaching alone   Even that is not a universal belief among Christians. Sola scriptura is more of a Protestant thing. And among Protestants whose belief is based on the Bible's teaching alone, there are still disagreements on interpretation."

Who can become a leader in the church and how will the leadership be structured?  How does the congregation relate to other congregations? Are there fomral relationships, obligations, mutual accpuntability, or total independence?  There are plenty of mutually exclusive answers to these questions and a comgregation needs to choose which it will go with (or descend into chaos and be unable to function). Some of these answers,eas to the formation of institutions of like-minded congregations i.e. denominations. Others lead to independent congregations which are essentially denominations of one.  Basically without a central authority that everyone submits to, denominations are a necessity for the church to function."

Christians,3djk4k,Danny_V,7,Thu Jul 16 20:01:25 2015 UTC,"While my wife and I did wait until marriage, we know several Christian couples who did not.  Each of these couples made the decision you are talking about, and each of them was blessed/benefited from taking the step you describe of stopping and waiting from then on until marriage.  Part of what changes is that premarital sex can ""feel taboo"" which actually adds a kind of thrill to the sex -- but that goes away when you get married, which can make the sex feel like it ""lost something."" But really, what was happening all along was the rush of feeling like you're ""getting away with something."" That feeling wasn't coming from your love for each other, but from the sense of crossing a boundary line.  However, ""giving up sex"" from now on (til you're married) actually puts down roots into the principle that honoring marriage itself matters more than doing whatever feels good at the time. This sets a precedent in both of your minds/hearts that continues to matter while you're married -- that being faithful to each other (for decades, thru highs and lows) matters more than feeling good at the time (e.g. occasional adultery, porn-crutch habits, becoming emotionally dependent on a non-spouse, etc).  In other words, (1) it's holy for you to stop until marriage, (2) it's worth it, (3) it will only do damage if you don't, and (4) it will help in very real ways if you do. =)"

I know Christians who have fallen into sexual sins with one another and by God's grace able to abstain until marriage but it isn't easy since the door to sexual immorality has already been open already.  My concern is also with your approach towards sex specifically here: "". I am just worried that the sex won’t be the same once we get married but at the same time, I am also worried that the day we get married and have sex, it is not going to be as special because we have been doing it for the whole time.""  I think part of a Christian view of sex is that it is always going to special if it is driven by love.  I'm concerned about whether or not you are a Christian because the biggest concern for a Christian in sexual immorality is whether or not one is obedient to God and one's repentance unto God for forgiveness through Jesus Christ's atonement for sins.  That's a bigger concern rather than whether or not the sex ""would still be special."""

Christians,3djk4k,nanner57,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:15:48 2015 UTC,"I have a few things I would like to share with you Danny. First if all abstaining from sex from now until you are married is definitely what God wants from you. If you make the decision to do that it should be because you are at a point that you can admit to God that it was wrong and ask him to forgive you and let you make a new beginning and not just because some other people told you it worked for them. God will definitely honor that decision. I believe that your sex life after marriage will be much more wonderful because of it, and because God will unite you and make you one on the day you marry, your physical relationship will reflect that oneness and be so much more meaningful. A good friend  and her boyfriend  moved in together for about 6 months and then because of meeting with the pastor who was going to marry them they made a decision to separate until marriage. At first this was more to make the pastor happy so he would marry them, but he brought them to a point where they knew they needed to do it for God and not to please the pastor. They were married 4 months later and looking back they are so glad they did it this way. They said the always knew what they were doing was wrong and not really what they should have been doing. They admitted that to God and asked him to forgive them and they felt so much better about their relationship. God will always bless and honor a decision we make to do what is right according to his word. Ask God to help give you strength and peace about this decision"
Christians,3djk4k,Dying_Daily,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:52:23 2015 UTC,"Others experiences are irrelevant. God has defined when sex should take place, and He has made clear that it should be enjoyed only within marriage. What you have done is taken one of the wonderful benefits of marriage and enjoyed it in selfish pleasure without the attached responsibility. The fact that you are so concerned about how sex will be after marriage shows that you know very little about the actual purpose of marriage, nor do you understand its purpose. Now that you have already joined with her, it is your responsibility to be a man, marry her and take care of her for the rest of your life."

We know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him. For the death he died he died to sin, once for all, but the life he lives he lives to God. So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.     Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, to make you obey its passions. Do not present your members to sin as instruments for unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and your members to God as instruments for righteousness. (Romans 6:8-13 ESV)   So it is both true that we can do nothing apart from Christ and the Spirit but also that we are expected to actively renounce sin and no allow it to reign in our bodies. Hebrews 12 says that we are to pursue holiness, without which no one will see the Lord. So yes, it is God who works in us, but we actively, not passively, strive to bear the fruit of repentance which has been given as a free gift of grace by the working of the Holy Spirit.   So my point is that the author's entire argument is crap. We don't resist sin. We don't each have a different sin that besets us. The Holy Spirit allows us to endure sin until God provides an escape and it's loss of hope which underpins faith that causes us to fall away and sin.   This is both unkind and unbiblical. Please refrain from promoting this unbiblical doctrine or it will result in a ban. I would encourage you to search the Scriptures and learn about the importance of pursuing holiness, not to earn your salvation by works, but in order to see Christ working in you and to make your calling and election sure."
Christians,3d5wqt,theplacewiththestuff,2,Tue Jul 14 08:42:00 2015 UTC,"I'm being completely honest here, not trolling. I provided an argument from scripture to back up my points. Granted, I didn't highlight the active role in seeking God or pursuing holiness as you put it. I concede that point.  However, I'm struggling to see where I'm wrong or where my understanding of scripture is off. Again, I backed up my argument with what I thought were the relevant scriptures. In the interest of clarity my argument was that there is one sin that besets all of mankind, loss of hope in God which undermines faith/trust. This is what we need to focus on when dealing with people lost/despairing in sin, where their hope is. That's not to say there aren't other sins. Also, that we don't resist sin, we endure it until we are provided an escape by God.  You have the scriptures I quoted to back that up. To be clear, I'm appealing to 2 Tim 3:16 when I ask my next question:   All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction   If what I said is unbiblical I would really like to know so I can repent and reprocess the verses I quoted, so where am I wrong?  Edit: By endure, I don't mean give in to sin but to suffer through the temptation.  Edit 2: Are you serious about deleting my last comment?"

God, the embodiment of love and compassion, decides at random to make some people in a way specifically so they can suffer in his name. Either they give in to the urges he forced upon them and are later punished, or they resist them at the cost of torturing themselves in his name. Is that about right?"

Out of suffering comes reliance on God rather than on ourselves.  Our faith is refined by suffering and by persecution and we are able to help others through that suffering.  1 Corinthians 1:3-5   3 Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort, 4 who comforts us in all our troubles so that we may be able to comfort those experiencing any trouble with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God. 5 For just as the sufferings of Christ overflow toward us, so also our comfort through Christ overflows to you."

Christians,3cxo8o,FT4M,4,Sat Jul 11 18:28:44 2015 UTC,"I grew in the stereotypical bible belt christian home. Dad drank, cussed, and read the bible at times. As a kid we went to church on Sundays and I got popped in the back of the head for cutting up in the pew. That good ole dad arm stretched over the pew, covering the whole family, was an ever-vigilant behavior sentinel.   The preacher was a great guy as I recall, very passionate about preaching the Word of God in that small First Baptist church past the railroad tracks. At times he would even spontaneously dress up like Moses, Noah, or a centurion based on what his sermon was! As a kid I was always fascinated with history so moments like these really grasped my attention.  Over the years though my old man's drinking got worse. He cussed like crazy too. Although I found it hard to blame the man too much. His own dad only showed up once in a while, usually drunk and violent, during his youth.   I remember coming home from school one day, I was maybe ten or eleven at the time, and my dad was at the bus stop to pick me up. I knew something was strange because I normally rode my bike the rest of the way home, only a quarter of a mile. But he tells me to put my bike in the trunk and hop in the car so I did. On the way home he told me that he had been unfaithful to my mother and they were going to get divorced. Strangely enough I wasn't mad at my dad at first. It was God I pointed the finger at. I carried that hate with me for a long time.  A few months later my dad came home one day and said he'd had a dream about Jesus. Apparently in this dream my dad was pulling water from a well and when it got to the top of the well there were two glasses filled with water. One of the glasses has crystal clear water and the other glass looked to be filled with abysmally black water. Jesus told him to choose, so my dad drank the crystal clear water. When he woke up he prayed for mercy from Christ and immediately left the woman he was staying with to come beg my mother back.  My mom took him back with somewhat reluctant arms. I was happy to have my dad back in my life. But, I still hated God for what He had put me through. For a while at least, I still played the good christian boy at home. It was a much different story when I was with friends or by myself though.  When my dad had been home again for about a year he told us that he felt God was calling us to be missionaries two thousand miles away. So off we went to the Great White North.  During my early teenage years the occult fascinated me. I read a few different books on the subject and eventually grew out of it. But I did keep looking for something to sever myself from the idea of the christian God. I found that in two places: my high school biology teacher and the satanic bible.  In these two things I found faith and religion centered around me. Both claimed that no external god existed, that there is no afterlife, that all pleasure is in the here and now, and there is no morally absolute dividing line other than self-preservation. I found the self-serving religion I wanted (satanism) and the evidence to back it up (evolution).  Before this moment I had never felt so free in my life. I could hate without feeling bad, I could lust without limit, I would lie and slander at the drop of a hat if it pleased me to do so. I was not longer bound by any moral code but my own if I so chose to make one.  Aaand then I joined the Marines at nineteen. What a wake up call. I couldn't rely on myself for anything anymore. Because of this new alpha male society I had to drop satanism (the religious aspect) but my atheist worldview thrived. When I got to the fleet work was work, but when libo (freetime) came around it was time to hit the bar to drink and find women to fornicate with.  More than a few times I had got office hours (a type of punishment) for being late to formation or bucking authority. I said what was on my mind without thinking about it at times. I was really bad about it if I met a christian marine that was my rank or less. I would ridicule them, mock them, challenge their belief, and spread rumors about them behind their back. I was only that mean to christians in or out of the corps. For some reason that I'm still note sure of I became open to the idea of there being a god again during my last few months in. I can't explain it, but I did know I still hated the God of the bible.  Much to the relief of some of the fellow marines in my unit, I got out in 2013. It wasn't long before I got a job with a detention facility. Until I had reached this point in my life I had prided myself on my lack of morals put forward by society. I got a shock when I saw these inmates and what a real lack of morals consisted of. I don't think I had ever seen real evil until I looked into the eyes of a pedophile who bragged openly about his crimes as if he was trying to relive it for any who could hear.  Everyday I went to work, did my rounds (checked on inmates, subdued inmates, etc..) and I always went home a little more depressed and bitter than the day before.  However, there was one inmate that bothered me more than the others. We'll call him Joe. Joe was in jail my entire time there. He was there for aggravated assault and murder. He bothered me for a different reason than the rest of the inmates. Every time that I walked past Joe's cell he was reading the bible, praying, and telling anyone who would listen about Christ. He was always happy, never broke any rules, and was compliant to every order. Joe had become a christian through the jail ministry a month after being locked away.  I hated Joe because he was happier, locked away in his little cell, than I was with my freedom and drinking. Slowly over the course of time I listened to Joe more intently. I had heard the gospel many times before. But hearing it from Joe was like being confronted with an absolute truth. If I wanted to I could've used the same tactics I had used before with others to dismiss him, but I couldn't. I don't know why. It was tearing me apart inside. In my thoughts I felt like a wild animal that had just been caged. Much like you would see on the discovery channel. I was panicky, I was desperately trying to push God aside like I had before and I just couldn't. It terrified me.   Every time I cussed, or drank, or looked lustfully at a woman it was like I was being condemned over and over. The crazy thing is, Joe never spoke to me personally. All of this was happening to me just from hearing him.  Early last year I slowly began to read the bible sceptically. I was mainly looking for any contradiction I could find to not believe it so I could ease my conscience. After of a month of off and on reading I quit drinking. I didn't even try to, I just stopped. I was in every sense an alcoholic - full on alcohol dependence. I didn't have any withdrawal symptoms nor have I had any cravings to this day.  In the middle of last year I left that job for the one I'm currently at. I still wasn't converted though. I went to another state to train and left my family behind because we couldn't afford to move them out here yet.  For those few months I was by myself with no outside distractions aside from training. All I had in my little apartment was a sofa, a bible, and youtube. I read the bible nonstop for hours desperately trying to figure out what had been bothering me. If I had a question I would watch a youtube sermon on the subject from Paul Washer.  Now, I don't know if you know anything about Paul Washer. But he is a very difficult man to listen to. Not because he uses big words or anything, but because he is constantly telling you to examine yourself in light of scripture.   One day I was reading through Matthew 7, and I went to Paul Washer for more explanation. He spoke about how so many people call Christ their Lord but don't submit to Him as such and show no fruits of genuine conversion. Then he moved on to how no one is good. This was the final straw for me. My last wall of pride was torn down and I broke. I was naked in my shame before a Holy God with no where to run. The only thing I could do was confess my wickedness and rebellion and beg for His forgiveness hoping that there was room for me in His mercy. In fact there was room. And it's glorious. His son loves me. All of the vile, putrid, lawlessness that has poured from my mouth and actions... It's all forgiven. In return, I am His willing slave.   I have and will mess up at times, but all I need to do is look back at the cross in prayer and repentance. It's true that I was forgiven once and for all. But it's because of my continuous repentance and obedience to His will that I can rest sure of my salvation.  In closing, if you're not saved. Repent, believe in the gospel, and place your faith in Christ - there is room still at the foot of the cross. If you've backslid and feel shameful; repent, believe in the gospel and place your faith in Christ - there is room still at the foot of the cross. If you're not sure if you're saved; repent, believe in the gospel, and place your faith in Christ - there is room still at the foot of the cross.  Soli Deo Gloria!"
Christians,3cxo8o,of_skies_and_seas,3,Sat Jul 11 21:31:15 2015 UTC,"Wow, what a story! I'm so happy for you  :) I am also a former atheist, but I have a story that is quite different but also similar to yours:  I grew up in the stereotypical modern home - a mixed culture/race/religion family in a similarly multicultural city. My dad is German, a kind, patient, gentle vegetarian, a nominal/nonpracticing Christian who loved computers and science. My mom is a Chinese immigrant from Vietnam, a similarly nominal Buddhist who  who stayed home to take care of the family.   I was raised mostly without religion though I had some faint ideas that there was a God. I went to church and the temple only when visiting grandparents or going to funerals. It was just a ritual, not any real belief. As I grew older, I started to believe that religion was a man made construct, same as any other cultural trait. This was what most of my friends believed and what was taught in school. It might be comforting and help people explain the workings of the natural world in the past, but there's no actual evidence for it.   When I was in third grade, my dad's mom died and he really got to think about her faith. He started going to church and became very serious about faith - reading the Bible constantly, studying theology, and decided to move to a Lutheran church and started attending. I wasn't interested in going. By the end of elementary school, I was thoroughly an atheist.   And so it was until I went to high school. I made a friend my freshman year, a Christian girl. She would pray with me and even though I only joined in to avoid awkwardness at first, it truly began to affect me. I felt a connection to God for the first time. I knew that there was something beyond the physical reality of the universe. A true morality that was universal and not made by humans, a personal creator. But for a while it was nothing but a feeling.   It's kind of funny how you mentioned your biology text book as a crutch of sorts to escape from Christianity, because it was the opposite for me. I have a huge passion for science and biology was the one that really began to strengthen my curiosity for God. Learning how beautifully and miraculously genetics, cell structures, embryonic development worked - it made me really question myself. My secular political ideals were challenged as well, how could I continue being pro-choice when it had become so clear that those unborn embryos and fetuses were human?  It launched me into months of reading the Gospel with my friend and questioning that is too much to explain here, but I became a Christian in the spring. It is amazing how God could reach me and develop faith out of an atheist that knew essentially nothing about it since childhood. It was another year of learning about denominations before I decided to join the Lutheran church with my dad. I'm now in college and very thankful for God's grace."
Christians,3cxo8o,pilgrinn,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:05:41 2015 UTC,"I grew up in a Christian home and I have been going to church to since I was a baby.  I don’t really remember a time that I didn’t believe in God at least on some level but I didn’t end up becoming saved until later on. In my early life I acted the part of a Christian but I never really trusted God in my life. The world would have thought of me as a good kid but I was just as lost and sinful as any other person. Although I was not involved in anything overtly scandalous we know that even to hate your brother in your heart is murder and I was guilty of many other sins as well lying, stealing, adultery, etc. The gilt of my sin weighed heavy on me soul and I was unsatisfied with life. Growing up I would go to Sunday school and church service saying and doing what I was supposed to do. To the people around me I probably looked like a Christian but I wasn’t really. Sin still ruled my heart and I was apart from God. I would lie to and manipulate other people.  I was only concerned with myself and there was no place for the things of God in my life. I would pursue my own selfish desires regardless of whether they were pleasing to God. This entire time was also marked with a prevailing apathy toward God and other people. I was spiritually dead.   As I grew older I developed an Intellectual understanding of the gospel and likely believed that it was true. I was however not willing to fully give my life over to Christ. I was not willing to fully trust God nor was I willing to give up all of my sinful ways. The guilt of sin weighed on me. I knew that there was only one way to be reconciled to God and that was though Jesus, but I was not willing to go to him. This left me stuck in an odd position I would not go to Christ but I was unwilling to leave as well. Knowing that there was no other way to be cleansed of my sin. I continued to go to Church while indulging my worldliness. Over time God worked in me and brought me out of the world and to faith in him. I eventually came to put my full faith and dependence in the cross of Christ to wash away my sin. I came to rely entirely on the substitution that Jesus made on the cross. God called me out of sin to find peace in the all sufficient power of Christ’s atonement.  As I grow in my Christian life I continue to develop. Every day I grow closer to God and am looking forward to the day I will be fully sanctified. Although sin still remains, it no longer rules over me. I have turned away from and continue to fight the remaining sin in my life. No longer do I have the bear the burden of sin, Christ has taken it on himself and washed me white as snow. I’m not simply playing the role of a Christian anymore. I now take delight in God and the things of God. I have a genuine concern for other people. As I attended church services, read the bible, and pray Christ continues to work in me. Today I am alive in Christ."

People ""hate"" anything they disagree with, therefore it's understandable that all non-Christians are going to hate what the Bible says, and call it hate speech.  Gay people don't want to hear that being gay is wrong, just like murderers don't want to hear murdering is wrong, and could send them to Hell, however, the Bible tells us both of these things are wrong. What are gay people and murderers going to label that? ""Hate speech"".  There's no making everyone agree... there are too many people who would rather live hedonistic, sinful lives, than grounded, righteous lives. Just look at the changes in the United States, becoming not only secular, but anti-Christian, more and more every day.... And not ""anit-God"", no, because other religious people and religions now days are much more accepted and tendered to in the United States than Christianity, such as Jews (Judaism) and Muslims (Islam), due to the fact of the majority wanting to be seen as ""accepting"" and ""open"" to different cultures and religions, but when it comes to Christians (Christianity), it seems ok for these people to be belligerent and outright disrespectful towards them, because they ""fit it"", and are seen as the majority.... This was not always the case, but is definitely becoming more and more so these days....  It's just like how many non-Christians, primarily atheists, say that religions people are too close-minded, and can't think for themselves, when although this does seem to be true in many cases, often times it's quite the contrary, where religions people are the open-minded ones, see everything as it is, and can decipher good from evil, right from wrong, and have the ability to determine what's moral and what is not, whereas many non-Christians cannot, seeing nearly everything as acceptable (some examples would be same-gender marriage, abortion, pornography, prostitution, masturbation, fornication, pedophilia, etc.) . I guess what I'm saying is people don't like having boundaries; they don't want to think that their beliefs, some of the events they may partake in, or actions they do, are wrong, and could cost them greatly (going to Hell as opposed to Heaven). They'd instead rather blindly believe that they can do whatever they want and have no consequences, and that they'll be just fine, when that in fact is not the case."

That is exactly what our persecutors want. People hate being reminded of their sin, but it is their sin that enslaves and condemns them. How can we warn them of judgment when they don't even want to be told that what they have done is wrong?  Our goal should be to speak the truth in love. Saying that homosexual behavior is sinful according to Scripture is not something I would want to shy away from, any more than I would try to hide anything else in the Bible."

Once it's possible for the government to say what can be said and what can be published regardless of whether it actually harms somebody, it's only a matter of time before unpopular ideas become banned--unless the people act.

Satan himself is extremely familiar with biblical verses as described by Jesus's temptation. The apostle Paul wrote a lot about Christian false prophets. So a lot of people who think they are Christian and saved may not actually be saved. This included also folk who go to bible classes, Sunday service, do charity, etc.  Rather faith is believing that we are redeemed by Jesus's sacrifice on the cross and our determination to die to the desires of our flesh so that we can walk in the spirit. Faith is a verbal, physical, spiritual and psychological affirmation of our relationship with God.  Many people profess they are Christian but have never been born again. Which means they believe Jesus is God but have never sought a private personal relationship with him nor have they made any attempt to bring about a change in their lives. They are like the Pharisees as Jesus described them as outwardly religious but internally they have no idea on who their God really is. This is because they chose to dictate to God on the terms of their relationship I.e. They let religion come in the way of a relationship. They thought they could earn their way into heaven by good works and religious duty.  Our salvation is not determined by our good deeds. Rather good deeds are what we will be relatively rewarded with. Rather our works are the steps we take to back up our faith.   We are commanded to have a loving relationship with God as the number 1 commandment and number 2, to love others by servitude and sharing of the gospel.  God's plan for our lives on earth is to prepare us for eternity. We are put on a journey to develop a relationship with him in preparation for spending eternity with his holy presence.

Christians,3ctr92,kdz13,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:31:39 2015 UTC,I was introduced to these four tiers over in that other sub on reddit that starts with r/christian and I found the concept incredibly helpful.  I want to go back to some instances in my past and try to encourage a discussion about which tier certain issues should be placed in instead of THIS IS RIGHT and THIS IS WRONG shouting that disagreements in the body of Christ tend to digress very quickly into.  Sharing here for two reasons - to save the link for my own personal future reference and also to ask two questions:   what do you think of this idea brothers? what issues would you like to see in which tier?
Christians,3ctr92,borntoperform,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:36:32 2015 UTC,"I wholeheartedly agree.    The Gospel should always be the focal point. Any doctrine surrounding the gospel should be defended. And the Gospel is focused around Christ, so the Virgin Birth, His perfect life, His work, His fulfillment of the Old Covenant, His death and resurrection, etc. All these need complete uniformity among Christians. If you don't believe Jesus IS God, you've changed the Gospel. If you don't believe Jesus is the only Way, you've changed the Gospel. This doctrine shows who the Christians and non-Christians are. Also, right up there is what is actually sin and what isn't. Murder is sin, lying is sin, fornication/homosexuality is sin. These things must be defended. The practice of the local church: how it's governed, the sacraments, which Bible version to use, women in leadership, and evangelism methods are here. While all Christians can disagree with things here, a local church cannot. There must be unity here. Remaining doctrine: eschatology, spiritual gifts, tithing, hermenutics. There can (and should) be disagreements in the local church. I believe there should be differences in the local church here because if everyone believed the same thing, it's almost a guarantee that it's a cultish environment. Matters of liberty and conscience: pretty much any issue that is not explicity mentioned in the New Covenant: drinking alcohol, smoking marijuana, getting a tattoo, birth control, letting women wear pants, etc."
Christians,3ctr92,thatrightwinger,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:03:20 2015 UTC,"I generally agree with this, but matters of tongues really needs to be in category 2.  It's not a doctrine which has any effect on the nature of the church, but it could have a distracting effect.  People need not agree with the church in the matter, but if they act on it, it could very be a disruption.  The individual congregations need to determine what they're going to teach, and stick to it, so all will act in according manner."
Christians,3ctr92,thatrightwinger,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:06:03 2015 UTC,"The more I think about it, it's clear to me that thinking of things this way won't necessarily lead to more agreement or less division in the church.  Rather, it gives us the language and structure to define our difference.  As a teen, I recall being deeply confused when, during a time of disagreement in the church, the pastor's wife said ""I don't think [insert name of famous Christian here] is going to hell, but I could never attend the same church""  If we had this structure, and if we put our ""issues"" into the appropriate tiers, then perhaps we can discuss why something should or should not be in a certain tier instead of arguing about ""BUT THE BIBLE SAYS THIS AND YOU ARE CLEARLY WRONG!!!""  So using your issue as an example, perhaps a Pentecostal leaning brother might understand a request to find another place to fellowship and/or to suppress what he sees as his gift in church meeting instead of leaving and muttering to all who will listen about the legalistic heathens over at thus and so IFB church...."

Christians,3cpksj,Dying_Daily,2,Thu Jul 9 19:23:45 2015 UTC,"Sin is misunderstood. It is not the act of rebelling against God's law but rather sin is any act that can damage your relationship with God.  When Jesus died, he took away all your sins past, present and future. So God does not have a barrier to you. Rather sin creates the barrier from you to him.  Does masturbation bring you closer to God? Or does it make you feel guilty and shameful to be in his presence.  Remember the number 1 commandment of God. You shall love and worship no other God but the Lord your God. Masturbation is worship of lust. It is idolatory even though it appears harmless.  God's plan for your life is for you to form a deeper relationship with him in preparation for spending eternity wrapped around his presence and this involves him allowing you to face trials and temptations in order to build you up. Satan's plan is to cause you to doubt God's plan by gradually rebelling against it.  You are like Adam being tempted in the garden of eden. The evil one tells you that you are better, you deserve to have fun like everyone else, you deserve a creator to work for you rather than the other way around, you are not holy enough, how can you pray when you did XYZ, etc. He may even throw bible verses at you like wide is the highway to hell but narrow is the pathway to heaven, why do you call me teacher when you do not obey my word, etc. Jesus himself was tempted in the same way.  You must recognise these thoughts and defeat them mentally through knowledge of God's word. You were purchased by Jesus and there is nothing you can do to repay him or earn your salvation. You were chosen by him before you were born.  Your masturbation has a deeper cause. We partake in it like an addiction to compensate for something else whether it's loneliness, stress, lack of affection, boredom or anger. I am sure you know it yourself but it is kept locked deep in your heart.  Pray to the holy spirit for wisdom and memory of the verses to fight temptation. You cannot avoid it but you can defeat it.  God bless you brother. Life is a marathon as Paul said."

I personally have never thought about the issue until now.   First let me say that the word ""flag"" as we are using it is not found in the version of the bible I used to search (basically the kjv) for the word. However the word ""banner"" is found 6 times Here are two verses that I think support what that pastor is doing.   We will rejoice in your salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up our banners: the LORD fulfill all your petitions. - Psalms 20:5 . You have given a banner to them that fear you, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah.  - Psalms 60:4   There is one other verse that applies, and for those of us old enough to remember there is a song attached to it   He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love. - Song of Solomon 2:4   I just hope that the churches that follow that pastors example with that flag also  show love to their community and the people who visit their church. I am not speaking of love as the world defines it,  but love as God through scripture defines it and also has shown us."

I complained and they changed the way they did it.  Ultimately I stopped participating at all, not liking the involvement of nationalism in church, period, which is still what this is.  The Christian flag and the American flag aren't really in competition--one is, at best, a symbol of something invisible and eternal and heavenly, while the other is a symbol of something temporal, sinful, and yet where God has placed us and commanded our obedience... and symbolic gestures aren't very meaningful.  This seems very reactionary and kind of spiteful, honestly.  Serving God before government is something that dictates our actions, and is spoken to by our actions, not which flag we string up on a new flagpole.  And in this day and age, it seems like it might be more relevant to emphasize that we serve our government because we serve God, irrespective of whether or not our government is ""good."""

I am pretty extremely aniconic and would prefer not to have crosses in churches, though.  The cross is used as a verbal symbol, a metaphor, in Scripture, but I don't think it should be used in worship, as an image.  But that really wasn't actually what I was objecting to here.  There can be a place for using symbols as linguistic shorthand, and sometimes in Christianity, that's what the cross (the fish, the anchor, etc.) amount to.  But here it's just a false symbol.  The metaphorical ""cross"" of the EO, RCC, Methodist, Lutheran, and Episcopal churches aren't the same metaphorical ""cross"" we affirm.  Yet here they are united in a totally false commonality."

It teaches us to live at peace and dignity with everyone around us as much as possible. All this pastor is doing is making his congregation a lightning rod for drama and unneeded anxiety. Most Christian families are doing all they can just to get by with the basics and just want to be left alone to worship freely and not drawn into intentionally provoked controversy.

I think making it blatantly obvious that your allegiance lies with Christ and not this country shouldn't be called foolishness.   In fact I like what they're doing because it's a huge step towards Christians finally acting and being notably different and separate from the world. Protestantism has hurt the Church in that everybody acts just like the culture (due to Calvin's foolish idea that we have to redeem this world and Christianize it to bring about the Second Coming). It's about time we stood up and differentiated ourselves.  That's my two cents anyway."

And what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away. (Hebrews 8:13)   Yes.  To answer the second part of your question...I don't know that the death penalty is observed because of a desire to adhere to the Old Testament -- not in every case anyway. But the fact is that there have been and will always be professing Christians who do not understand the New Covenant, the law of the Spirit, and will try to load the burdens of Moses on other Christians. Theonomists are a good example of this, but this even happens in more mainstream denominations. And the reason this happens always boils down to a lack of understanding of the Old Covenant."

Christians,3cfpx0,Dying_Daily,2,Tue Jul 7 16:11:04 2015 UTC,"I believe in both mercy and justice. I always (try to!) lean toward the side of mercy. I want to see people reflect the image of God in which they were created, which is to show love and kindness to their neighbors. But I also know that even with a heart changed by the Holy Spirit, I myself do some really unloving things for which there are just and fair consequences. For those who are outside of Christ and do not have a new heart that is inclined to be like Him, the Bible teaches that they are dead in their trespasses in sin, living in the passions of their flesh, and children of wrath. So my understanding of Scripture's teaching, seeing the reality of it both within myself and in others, I think there are cases with certain individuals who are so wicked and so evil that the death penalty is a fair and necessary penalty for certain crimes committed. I say that soberly and cautiously, and as I said before, would want to look more for opportunities of mercy rather than justice. Because the fact of the matter is, I received incredible mercy when I should have in fact received the wrath of God for my sin."

He claims that there are people on the earth who do not belong is society anymore and should be put to death, instead of risking others lives while they are in prison. I understand the point but I don't know how I feel about it. I see that by putting these type of people on the death penalty it COULD save other lives but it would also be killing another person. Part of me would want to just lock them up and hope and pray no harm comes to other people. But with that he claims it cost to much resources and time to nurture people who he claims doesn't belong."

What if the people are innocent guards or inmates who are good now? The argument I here for acceptance of the death penalty is by the death penalty you COULD be saving other lives. Still with that I'm not sure if it is the people's right to choose who lives or dies... It seems you have option A: death penalty and may save other people from that one person or option B: lock the person up and hope and pray no harm comes to him or other people, all while using resources to nurture this person some believe do not belong."

Christians,3cfpx0,anakrino,2,Tue Jul 7 19:00:42 2015 UTC,"Jesus had committed blasphemy in the eyes of the Jews. Blasphemy is a HUGE deal to Jews and the thief said Jesus did not deserve what happened to him. The fact that he knew who Christ was and knowing that the forgiveness of Christ would get him to heaven shows that the thief knew some of the more detailed teachings of Christ.   Also, Let's look at the punishments for theft under the Jewish law:  Leviticus 6:1-5 - The Lord spoke to Moses, saying, “If anyone sins and commits a breach of faith against the Lord by deceiving his neighbor in a matter of deposit or security, or through robbery, or if he has oppressed his neighbor or has found something lost and lied about it, swearing falsely—in any of all the things that people do and sin thereby— if he has sinned and has realized his guilt and will restore what he took by robbery or what he got by oppression or the deposit that was committed to him or the lost thing that he found or anything about which he has sworn falsely, he shall restore it in full and shall add a fifth to it, and give it to him to whom it belongs on the day he realizes his guilt.   Exodus 22:1 - If a man steals an ox or a sheep, and kills it or sells it, he shall repay five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.   Exodus 22:3-4 - But if the sun has risen on him, there shall be bloodguilt for him. He shall surely pay. If he has nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft. If the stolen beast is found alive in his possession, whether it is an ox or a donkey or a sheep, he shall pay double.   Proverbs 6:30-31 - People do not despise a thief if he steals to satisfy his appetite when he is hungry, but if he is caught, he will pay sevenfold; he will give all the goods of his house.   No execution listed. So the thief said his punishment was just under Roman law."
Christians,3cfpx0,mlokm,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:13:01 2015 UTC,"why do some Christians (most it seems) still follow parts of old testament law? Particularly the death penalty.   The Mosaic Law in part reflects universal moral obligations that exist whether the Mosaic Law is in effect or not.  Most would agree that, say, the prohibition against worshiping idols is universal but the prohibition against wearing mixed fiber clothing was not.  Though the Mosaic Law is no longer in effect, all people are still under the moral obligation not to worship idols.  But no one is under an obligation not to wear mixed fiber clothing after the fulfillment of the Mosaic Law by Christ.  Admittedly sometimes nailing down which parts were particular to the Law and which parts weren't can sometimes be difficult.  But one thing we can look at is whether the prohibitions and penalties show up outside the Mosaic Law.  That seems to be the case with the death penalty for murder as it appears long before the Mosaic Law just after the flood:   [Gen 9:5-6 NASB] 5 ""Surely I will require your lifeblood; from every beast I will require it. And from every man, from every man's brother I will require the life of man. 6 ""Whoever sheds man's blood, By man his blood shall be shed, For in the image of God He made man.   This would seem to place murder and the death penalty in the category of universal moral obligations rather than being specific to the Mosaic Law."

Because of 1, I have no allegiance to political systems; because of 2, I don't have a big personal investment in them, and because of 3, I vote for people who are anti-murder 100% of the time, and uphold biblical values as much as possible (including feeding the hungry, prosecuting unrighteousness, promoting fairness, etc.).  I don't believe ""the ends justify the means"" and simply vote against sin wherever possible, rather than trying to manipulate the system.

Christians,3cdpaz,injoy,3,Tue Jul 7 18:05:47 2015 UTC,"*I think that something we should remember, especially American Christians at this time, is that we are not to be of this world. Jeremiah does tells us to settle into this world, but it is never said that we should try to change it on an institutional level. Christ called for us to be personally transformative, to be beacons to His light. Christ did not say that we should change the government.  Many people argue that socialism and communism are Christian political systems due to their giving to all people. Others argue republicans are the correct ones because they want many biblical laws to be made and kept. Others argue democrats are right because they want peace and acceptance. Further still, some argue that monarchy is right due to scripture where the people of Israel wanted a monarch. There seems to be no group that doesn't think they're on God's side.   But, I don't think He belongs to any political party. I think His concern is more towards our individual choices and actions, not governmental choices and actions. Not to say that we shouldn't vote or that God doesn't care about injustice and laws going against His people, just to say that He seems to be more concerned with us individually than us as a political system.   That being said, I think people should vote however they think they should. As long as a political system isn't purely evil or based in hate (for instance, I think God would disapprove of nazism due to it's goal being annihilation of the Jewish people), I think He doesn't have much concern over it. What He has a concern for seems to be based on His people following him. No matter what nation hosts us or what the laws are, we are His people. His love and favor is based on our following on an individual level, not a political one.   Edit: a popular response to the point I'm making is to cite the story of Sodom and Gomorrah. My response to this would be that God allowed for these cities to be destroyed because they were devoid of righteous people. He did not allow for it to be destroyed because of what they had on their law books. If we look to the pharisees, we see that even when following God's law by the book, we have to do it with love in mind. So, I have to ask, which of the following would God look more favorably upon?   A city that had laws based on scripture but devoid of righteousness. Basically, a city of pharisees.   Or    A city without any laws or laws that were not based on the scriptures, but all the people lovingly and dutifully followed His will."

Things like acceptance of the death penalty and opposition to abortion came before I became a Christian. My opposition to the war on drugs came after and was directly influenced by my Christian beliefs.
Christians,3cdpaz,Youngwhippersnapper6,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:21:57 2015 UTC,Why is it that you accept the death penalty but not abortion? If you don't me asking.
Christians,3cdpaz,Tapochka,2,Tue Jul 7 21:31:18 2015 UTC,"I believe now as I did prior to becoming a Christian that if human life has intrinsic value then the involuntary death of another person should never be taken lightly. Now this is self evident due to my understanding of reality through the lenses of Christianity. However, before I became a Christian, I had to reason it out. I used the generally agreed on worst examples of evil as a baseline to build my foundation of what value a human had. I could find nobody who could justify slavery outside of statements about it being culturally acceptable at the time. I could find no reason to justify sacrifices of humans by the Aztec empire outside of it being culturally acceptable at the time. I could find no reason to justify the horrors of Nazi Germany. No reason to justify the killing fields of Cambodia. No reason to justify the millions dead in China and the Soviet bloc due to Communist ideology. All these things are dismissed with weak justification, condemned, or denied. As such, I reasoned that the horror we feel when exposed to this was caused by an intrinsic worth of humanity greater than the worth of the fish I was fond of fishing for or the chicken from the back yard my father slaughtered for dinner. Once I had established this, the question became at what point can a human life lose its intrinsic right to life? The fact there is a point seems self evident simply by virtue of the fact that if I have a right to life and the person attacking me has a right to life, one of our rights cannot be logically absolute. It then becomes obvious that it is the aggressor who has lost his right to life because my right to life logically entitles me to the right of self defense. If at that point I now have the right to take the aggressors life then the question becomes at what point can a person lose their right to life? It seems obvious to me that if I have the right to take his life in the heat of the moment, then the government should have the same right since    they are likely to not have the same bias that I do since they are not being attacked and  the decision will be made by twelve citizens who will have to live with the decision they have made and who will likely not rush to have someone killed unless they feel a reasonable certainty that the person is guilty. While it is possible to get twelve sociopaths on a jury, there presence in the general population is of a small enough percentage that the odds are unlikely even if the prosecutor was trying.    So having established justification for the death penalty, can the same standards be used to determine if abortion is justified? No, because it can take decades to put someone to death. So what justification can we use for abortion? Well the first question would be, is it human? I did not believe so at first which is why I supported abortion. When I discovered additional information after graduating from my mandatory liberal indoctrination (aka school), I changed my view accordingly.   So, is it alive? The answer is yes. It meets all the scientific and legal definitions of a living organism.   Is it a part of the mother? The answer is no. It has different DNA than the mother.  Is it like cancer? No, cancer DNA is the host DNA with minor modifications and the end result of cancer is death. A fetus has different DNA than its host and the host stands a much better chance of dying of complications from having an abortion then from carrying the child to term.   Is it a parasite? Only if you consider a newborn a parasite since it cannot live without a host either.   Is it human? Yes. The DNA is clearly human. It matches no other known species.   So at what point does the transition from a preexisting, non human state to human state happen? The clearest, least controversial, point is conception. Prior to that point there are two non human and even non living by some standard chemical envelops. A reaction takes place at which you have a living organism with fully human DNA.   The question then becomes, can this living organism with fully human DNA be considered a human being? I would argue that the default answer is yes simply because it is both living and in possession of human DNA. Is there an argument against it? Not really. All the arguments against it have already been dismissed a priori. The foundations for my belief in the intrinsic value of humans rests (prior to my conversion to Christianity) on the assumption that the great evils of the past form a baseline of human rights. The same evils that use the same arguments abortion supporters use. Things like, ""They are less than human"" which was what was used to justify slavery and the holocaust. ""It is not our place to judge"" which is used to justify the Aztec practice of human sacrifice. It is a private mater, it is none of our business, and therefore we should not interfere which was mentioned in conjunction with the mass killings of the Communists in Asia and Eastern Europe.   So, if I have an intrinsic right to life and my attacker has an intrinsic right to life and his life can be forfeit only under specific conditions, can a fetus ever achieve those conditions? The answer is yes, should a fetus pose a threat to the life of the mother then taking its life in self defense is justifiable. So does a fetus pose a threat to the life of the mother? Honestly given the opposition to abortion by so many women and given the almost non existent death rate of these women during child birth in the twenty plus years I have been looking into this, I would say that a theoretical threat to the life of a mother play a roll in far less than one percent of abortions.   I could go on and on, but this should give you some idea of my reasoning for holding the view that I did prior to becoming a Christian. It had nothing to do with any religious belief and instead was the logical conclusion based on preexisting assumptions.   EDIT to clarify one point."

And as a Christian, you've been made a friend of God's, even given access to pray to him with the authority of his son.  Of the very few things I do know about you, your ability to communicate with other humans stands out. You, a person with a mind and ideas and fears and hopes and all that, has a desire to share one of those internal things and is able to formulate an adequate summary of your internal experience and transmit that to other humans.  That's interesting to me.   I think it's a gift too. The gift of speech and literacy are valuable, but even more is the gift of community that you appear quite capable of using. If you have some friends in real life, go out for coffee or something today.

One of the few things I quote Kent Hovind on: ""God could have told Noah to MOVE."" After the Flood, God promised never to allow such a disaster again. Given that local floods continue to happen, we must conclude that either God did not keep his promise or that the Flood was not merely local.

However, God teaches His people not to be unequally yoked with non-believers, and God also teaches that sex is only created to be enjoyed in the context of marriage. You either need to repent of your sins and believe in the Gospel of Christ for eternal life and obey God and His Word, or you need to break it off with your boyfriend. Otherwise, you will incur greater judgment of God by not only causing him disobey His command about marriage, but should you choose to get married, you will cause him to make a mistake that will have damaging effects for the rest of his life (and yours). Most marriages of Christians and atheists are disastrous. So I would encourage you to study the Bible and see if you can submit yourself to Christ. If not, you need to break it off, for both your sake and his. If you don't, it will certainly end in terrible heartache."

For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication:   That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour; - I Thessalonians 4:2-4  Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge. - Hebrews 13:4"

(Yes, really.) Believing it's unrealistic suggests you simply don't have strong enough reasons to abstain, and you unconsciously know that ""hanging in there"" and trying to wait when you don't actually believe in waiting is a losing endeavor. Ask yourself if you are somehow inviting him to compromise his own beliefs and convictions. Are you attracted enough to him to believe there is ""something to"" the way he is, suggesting some kind of validity to Christianity? Or is it just happenstance that he's awesome? The irony is that he is compromising his faith just to be dating you, and is apparently oblivious to that. Just that fact alone weakens his foundations, which isn't a good ""setup"" for the long run. Putting #1 and #2 together, it seems like he's simply not as committed as his mother is. But that's his choice. If he doesn't want to abstain even to make his mom happy, there's no reason for you to feel to blame for that. That's entirely on him.   So what would I want as a mom? I'd want to know that me son's girlfriend is committed to ""following his lead,"" that the direction he takes the relationship, you will go there. This prompts the mom to put all of her influence on him, not on you.

The one reason it isn't ""realistic"" to be abstinent before marriage is because our society is saturated with sex in every direction and medium. Being in the world but not of it will put you in a strong position to resist sinful temptations.  If I were this guy, I'd call it quits and find a woman who shares the same love for my Lord that I do. This won't end well either way. Either he remains committed to his Lord and alienates you in the process or this guy loses his Lord over what's essentially just a girlfriend.  I feel bad for him and will be praying for him.

Marriage. Or he may not but the point is it will might enhance or ultimately destroy your relationship and that's a choice you need to make.  I don't want to make judgments of your character like some of the other posters do as we are incapable off doing so. But have you considered that Jesus wants a personal relationship with you irrespective of who you are and what you may have done.

Christians,3bwld6,FaZe_Clon,3,Thu Jul 2 22:35:34 2015 UTC,"Now hold up, you really can't compare homosexuality to bestiality or paedophilia, was a pretty massive difference here, namely that homosexuality takes place between two consenting people, while the same cannot be said of either of the other two. To be legalizing bestiality or paedophilia, you would be legalizing rape, while gay marriage is simply a relationship between two people of the same Sex. Polygamy and incest are much different matters, as they can both take place between multiple consenting adults, but both have other legal arguments against them, unlike gay marriage.   Edit: on second thought, I can actually think of no legal arguments against polygamy, and not a single reason that it is currently illegal. Maybe it will be legalised, and I can't say I would mourn the day. I don't like the idea of polygamous marriage, but when I can think of no good arguments against it, I tend to take it as a sign that I might be wrong about it."

It all comes back to that total depravity of man thing that the Bible teaches so clearly.  Again I quote God's Word:  Romans 1:29-32 ESV They are gossips, 30slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, 31foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless. 32Though they know God’s righteous decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them."

Hope you didn't take it that way.   While I agree partially with what you're saying (We're not called to keep the law perfectly for salvation. Christ did that.) and I don't want to get into a doctrinal debate, the use of the Old Testament is important as it's still from the same God as the New Testament and Jesus himself said:    “Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished.""

I will caveat that I believe precepts laid out in the New Testament to be of significant importance to Christ and following Christ. Love, forgiveness and truth are huge recurring themes in the New Testament, but when someone in the New Testament fell of the wagon or committed sins while claiming to be godly, they were called out for it. That's where we get into the verses in the New Testament concerning homosexuality and condemning it as a sin.   When the other poster made the distinction of old verses new covenant, he was simply stating that even under the New Covenant homosexuality is considered a sin, that even within the confines of the love and forgiveness of the New Testament, homosexuality is not over looked or let slide."

Apparently the group is able to get a deal at the community center, renting the room for $10 a night, so they figure the $520 annual cost is better than having a real church.  My friend and the church are both evangelical."

For a long time, it's been my dream to use my career skills to serve the Kingdom of God more directly, by developing software for ministries and mission organizations.  I have struggled to find a community of people doing this work - there are companies making products here and there, but there are very few places (I have found) for those people to share, build each other up, and encourage one another as iron sharpens iron.  I am trying to build just such a community.

In the short run, my goal is to just reach out to a lot of people and get them all connected to one another, so we know each other's names, plans, and projects.

Christians,3bjuig,unibuckeye,7,Mon Jun 29 20:29:17 2015 UTC,"I am scared too. My kids range in age from 7 to 2, so it is a battle I am already fighting. For this conversation, I will discuss my oldest child, my daughter. At 3 we sent her to the local public preschool because she was testing as developmentally delayed. The solution they came to was to send her to special ed classes, which we opposed, because she seemed to make faster progress when she was with the other children, rather than on her own. Well, they wouldn't listen. So we pulled her out with the intention of homeschooling her (I was homeschooled, so I knew the drill). Unfortunately, that coincided with my wife beginning to have seizures and other medical issues after the birth of our 4th child, so we laxed and she didn't learn. OK, this isn't working, time to change paths. We found a Christian school that other families in our church send their kids too, so we checked it out. We enrolled her in kindergarten. They have a speech therapist on staff who worked with her once a week and she has made incredible improvements by the end of her first year. I feel that since we made the decision for private school based on her education rather than just because it was a Christian school was justified. If the public school had listened to us, her parents, we may have left her there.  On the other hand, my good friend is a youth minister at is church and tells me that the kids who go to public school are stronger in their faith than those who don't, so that is a choice you have to make. I made my choice based on education. I sacrifice so my kids can have the best education I can procure for them. In my estimation it is worth it.  I hope this helps."

I know a lot of times they think they knows what is best for your child. My wife and I have actually discussed the home school route, but even then it has its challenges. I went to public school and I learned a lot about the society I lived in and how other kids were, which helped me make good decisions on whom I spent my time around. Public School may be the better option, especially since I recently moved my family to a small town area where my wife and her family knows the school staff and it is where my wife went to school. Thank you for your response. God bless."
Christians,3bjuig,CowboyBigBoss,6,Tue Jun 30 13:11:25 2015 UTC,"Not sure if this would be an option for you but we downgraded our home and lifestyle tremendously in order to send our son to a private school. The quality of the education is far superior to our local public school and they start every day with a morning assembly and prayer. Originally, we intended to just use their pre-K facility to give him a leg up on public school but he did so well, we decided to continue sending him there.   Another option would be to look into moving to a more rural setting. The further from the local population center you get, the less crazy the districts tend to be. Your commute might be worse but you tend to get a much better house for the same price and a superior school that way."

Children should go to school, meet people and learn with them. They also have to learn how to deal with being rejected because of their views. If they are only at home, only having daily life with other Christians, they are going to live in a pink bubble which will burst as soon as someone with a differing, maybe even hurtful view about Christianity will come their way. I don't want to say homeschooled people are socially-incompetent. But you are missing out on a whole lot of positive and negative experiences which are very valuable to a kid. Surely there is bullying, but your kids should learn how to face it which is talking with you (parents) and teachers about it and find a solution."
Christians,3bjuig,unibuckeye,4,Tue Jun 30 06:27:21 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I was homeschooled, and I have had minimal problems adjusting to society at large. It really depends on what you as a parent do to adapt. I was very active in church, for example. I feel it gave me a social advantage because I have no trouble relating to people outside my 'expected' social group. I have friends who range from teens to elderly. It has given me the blessing of diverse perspectives."
Christians,3bjuig,injoy,2,Tue Jun 30 09:17:29 2015 UTC,I am happy to hear that! It's very good to hear that God has blessed you with a church in which you could grow and be that active! As I said I don't think homeschooled people are socially-imcompetent. I just think that the experience you make in a public school are really valuable and I wouldn't want a kid to miss them.
Christians,3bjuig,TakeOffYourMask,2,Tue Jun 30 19:25:37 2015 UTC,"TBH, the only thing I 'missed' was the opportunity to play in sports. My state has a law that says as long as homeschoolers live in the district, they can participate in the sport program. Finances and politics (the school told my parents that I had to be enrolled in the school to play sports, my parents figured by the time all the lawsuits were settled I would be in college) kept me from it."
Christians,3bjuig,RagingMayo,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:19:13 2015 UTC,"Studies have actually shown that socializing with peers is not helpful socializing.  Homeschoolers are typically involved in MANY extra-curricular activities with fellow students across grade levels, as well as involved in many things in the community with adults from many walks of life, which is exactly the kind of socialization that is most helpful.  Kids in public school miss out on much of that adult and broad-spectrum interaction, which is very valuable.  They also miss out on incredible opportunities to do internships, study abroad, etc., because of the strict truancy laws.  Many homeschoolers are able to do internships at nearby companies and government agencies, while doing their schoolwork at the same time.  Many also do dual-enrollment at universities while they finish high school, and public universities are very accommodating of that.  I admit to knowing some ""bubbled"" homeschoolers, but it is much more closely correlated to the kind of parents they have, not the kind of schooling they receive.  The same kids can go to private or public school and turn out the same way.  I would guess that homeschoolers in Germany are probably even more like that, because there is so much risk involved for the parents to be homeschooling at all.  Many homeschoolers in the US are only part homeschoolers.  In fact, we are the only homeschooling family that I know of that doesn't go to school at least once a week for regular classes, and many spend two or three days in a brick and mortar school!  And--as a former public school teacher--I'm really happy teachers helped you with your bullying case, but that is certainly not the case in a good number of schools in the US.  Bullying is very common, and unresolved.  Also, I don't know how it is in Germany, but in the US, public school (and private school, generally) education is very, very standardized.  Bright students and struggling students are funneled into the same class and taught the same curriculum.  There are laws against accelerating students to their ability level.  Students who fail in one subject are kept back in the subjects where they succeeded, etc.  I think that's why homeschoolers in the US so vastly outperform their public and private school counterparts."

How should I know this? There was one occassion when a teacher sent the class representative to me (instead of talking herself) who should talk with me about the racial slurs. Funnily the class representative was bullying me, too. Nothing happened after that.   There was only one (other) teacher who actually did something. And I am thankful to God that she was there in that moment. Please don't generalise people.   But man, I feel that the discussion becomes a bit heated.

Christians,3bjuig,of_skies_and_seas,5,Tue Jun 30 19:03:47 2015 UTC,"I was in public school not that long ago, and it wasn't all bad. In fact it was in public school that I met a friend who shared the Gospel with me and I became a Christian. I was never ridiculed for being a Christian more than I was ridiculed for being anything else. I even dressed in long skirts all the time for modesty and no one made fun of me. My friends included atheists and Muslims and they never put me down for my beliefs. If you live in America, you can even homeschool your daughter if you're worried for her.   Anyway, I do think there is something good that can come out of going to a secular school as a Christian. At least for me and my Christian friends, we were made stronger by being exposed to that culture in our formative years. In my experience, it can be harder for people who go to private Christian schools when they leave because they aren't used to facing the secular culture (which is more representative of the society at large).   But I understand where you're coming from. There is the possibility I will be living in Germany when I have my first kid. I hope they don't grow up there because the schools are even more secular enforcing and there's no possibility of homeschool. And yet, some of the strongest Christians I know went through that school system and came out stronger in faith. I hope this sets your mind at ease. May God bless your daughter and yourself and see that your faith is strengthened throughout the rest of your lives."

Christians,3bjuig,mostimprovedpatient,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:43:28 2015 UTC,"Born and raised in Germany here. The public schools are indeed really secular, but so is the whole society as you already know. You won't be able to escape it, so you have to face it. I didn't receive much criticism because of my faith. Though I heard stories of other people of my congregation who had made rather bad experiences at some point of their school history. I think it's really differering for each person and with which people he/she gets coupled up, so it's a really indiviual thing.   My personal advice would be to keep an eye on the people your kid is spending time with, especially when it comes to the topic ""girlfriend/boyfriend"". I have seen a couple of people turning away from church/congregation because they met a girl/boy who dragged them off, often resulting in decay of built-up Christian morals. I don't want to judge those guys and gals, since I may be an even greater sinner. But sometimes Christians seem to lose the focus on Jesus Christ, when they spend too much time with the wrong people. I think I can speak a bit from own experience because I have quite a lot atheistic friends. Though don't be the helicopter mom, your kid will eventually have atheistic or otherwise religious friends."

And yeah, my friend has told me that the bigger problem is the girl/boyfriend thing as you say.   Btw, you can always find the German when they say ""guys and gals.""

Or worse when the government starts throwing pastors and board members and even members themselves into prison for the same supposed offence. Maybe you are saying ""that wouldn't happen"" let me remind you what has already happened in the last year with the bakeries and pizza businesses (among others) and the issue of gay marriage.   Granted we all know that this type of persecution  will happen sooner or later because the Bible tells us it will, and granted this is not the end of the world but it will be a huge issue for churches who wish to maintain a biblical standard when it comes to marriage try and uphold that standard. How many churches we now see as stable, bible believing churches will capitulate and perform those marriages instead of dealing with the legal issues?  There are many other issues that this nation has to be held accountable for that are much worse than the gay marriage issue. In my opinion the blood of millions and millions of babies killed through abortions rates much higher, but that is a different topic.   I agree its not the end of the world, but possibly it can become be a very intrusive change to the way Christians worship"

So you keep defending a dishonest video.  Even worse, after establishing that he moves that 'feeling' to another video clip 'as if' that shows Dawkins was a victim of many many 'scissor' edits.

Sure, there is a risk that these things will be problems next, but that risk had always been there.   Specifically, religious discrimination is still prohibited under the civil rights act. This was not overturned.  So, no employer can fire you for a lawful expression of your freedom of speech, and if they do, you sue them for unlawful termination.   Also, there is still no law obliging an individual (such as a photographer or cake maker) to perform services that are contrary to their faith. Lower courts have made some bad rulings on these issues to push a social agenda, but until the supreme court rules on the issue, there is nothing immediately problematic. Most attorneys, including those on the LGBT side who I have spoken with fully expect that individual freedom from forced labor will prevail for at least another couple decades.   It's also with noting that at least in Ohio a judge can turn down doing a judicial wedding without having to give a reason, so as long as someone is willing and able, that job is still protected. The same should apply to most other public jobs for now.   To be clear, no one expects it to stay that way indefinitely. The tides will turn. But at least in America, I expect that there will come a point when it turns too much, people will take notice, and laws will revert. That reversion may be a century away and require political revolution though."

When I worked with them they said they couldn't perform a SSM due to religious reasons. Now when push comes to shove I don't know how they could get out of it other than resigning or taking a demotion of some sort (idk that process on the legal side of things)  In many walks of life, as far as employment/firing goes, there are loopholes. Even if it was a matter of religious discrimination some folks don't have the money to spend on legal costs or the time to spend fighting it.

Other than that, I agree with the potential struggles you're referencing.  They are real and valid threats for those who have no ability to defend themselves, which is very unfortunate.

Really great comment, but I take issues to this part.  There have been a decent number of cases where under anti-discrimination laws, business have been told they have to render such services. Such as the farm that was told they had to allow gay couples to rent out their location for weddings or not at all.   I do not know the specifics on well most of the cases but I know a few like the Elaine photography case, for example, made it up to their states supreme court and then were decline to be taken up by the supreme court, so I am not sure about the level of problematicness."
Christians,3basp9,Naldor,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:00:11 2015 UTC,"Good point.  Perhaps I should clarify.  First off, sexual orientation is not a protected class under any existing state or federal law of which I am aware.  ""Gender"" is not either.  ""Sex"" is protected.  The courts have great difficulty discerning what this means.  If I recall correctly, the US Supreme Court has said (possibly in dicta) in past cases that this does not include orientation or gender perceptions, but genuine physical anatomy.  In this regard, the correct view of the law, per the Supreme Court - if they hold true to their past decisions (which won't necessarily happen in the future) - is that sexual orientation is not a protected class, and is thus open for discrimination by individual professionals.  That is why I say that many lower courts have made bad rulings to push a social agenda.  They know that they're making bad rulings because they want to get it to the US Supreme Court so that the current court will overrule the past cases that form the basis for the present law.  The US Supreme Court hates contradicting itself (a concept called stare decisis) and thus they refuse to participate.  This is the only way they can permit the (liberal) majority's intended consequence while still saving face so that no one can accuse the liberal justices of being blatantly defiant of the existing law as interpreted by prior credible justices."

Christians,3basp9,Dying_Daily,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:28:54 2015 UTC,"That's only for employment discrimination.  Even so, it is still valid law in all such states that a business whose purpose is inherently spiritual in nature does not have to comply with employment laws that are in violation of their spiritual beliefs without a compelling governmental interest that has no lesser restrictive means of it being enforced.  To be clear, this does not apply to most of the major cases around, which address whether or not businesses have to provide goods or services to a particular community of people.  So, a cake maker should (under existing law) be able to decline to make a cake with homosexual decorations on it, but he cannot fire an employee who comes out as a homosexual while employed there unless it is fundamental business model/purpose that he only serves Christians and that it is a Christian organization/business and inherently spiritual in nature.  It would be tough to make that claim, but it has been done before.  The Boy Scouts of America v. Dale case is uniquely on point here.  New Jersey has a law that says that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is prohibited in places of public accommodation.  The boy scouts revoked membership to one of their leaders who came out as a homosexual and gay rights advocate.  The trial court said that the boy scouts were allowed to do this.  The appellate court overturned the trial court and said that because the boy scouts hold themselves out to the public for open membership, that they qualify as a public accommodate, despite being a private entity.  The state supreme court affirmed the appellate court in saying that they must permit Dale to remain a member and leader in the organization.  The US Supreme Court overturned the state appellate and supreme courts, stating that the constitution gives the boy scouts a right to bar homosexuals from serving as troop leaders because to allow such would be inconsistent with the values it seeks to instill and that a gay troop leader's presence would force the organization to send a message that the boy scouts accepts homosexual conduct as a legitimate form of behavior.  This case has not been overturned and the deciding vote was Justice Kennedy, who voted in favor of the boy scouts.  Justice Kennedy was also the deciding vote in the present case.  It is unlikely that he will openly change his mind and vote if the same issue is presented to the supreme court again in the context of a cake maker, photographer, or whatever.  Although I think it's a somewhat weak concept, stare decisis holds a lot of power with respect to honoring past decisions (even bad ones), and its power is multiplied when the same justice is considering his own vote on the past decision."

Christians,3b81kg,JuiceBusters,3,Sat Jun 27 10:25:26 2015 UTC,"That article makes it sound like we are facing a total moral collapse. I'm seeing a lot of fear from my brothers and sisters. Romans 13:1 tells us we have to respect the decision of the law makers because God put them in power. So we shouldn't be so worried, God has a plan and I imagine it's unravelling the way he intended. Second of all the problem started way before this gay marriage crap when they said we don't want God in the government and in our schools. Since then we have been dealing with a lack of moral teaching and rules. This one ruling is not a game changer. The fact that gays can marry makes no difference because perversion starts in the heart.  While this article gives some good advice it treats homosexuality as a sin that we now need to fear. Lock your doors and throw away the key!!. Fact of the matter is it's no more a threat now than it was yesterday. It's not like I'm going to wake up and go hmm I want to play with boys. Sin starts small and grows, just like Faith.   What we need to guard against is regular sexual perversion because if we are all ready tempted by same sex relations.... Well the problem started long before you noticed you like people with the same naughty bits.   All to often Christians give in to fear of sin. My daddy us bigger than the boogie man. I do not fear sin because the standard of the Lord is with me. Yes we are to guard against sin but if you fear it, it is all ready working. Fear is caused by a lack of faith in God. If you fear homosexuality is consuming and tear at our society maybe the first thing you need to examine is why your not trusting God to take care of the world around you. I know some of you disagree with me maybe, but those are the facts."

I do agree with the sorry state of the churches. At least in my community. those who have Powerful pastors lack passion to rise to the messages that are delivered, and those churches with hungry congregations are led by pastors with out conviction and fire in their chest.   The problem is not that the message is not being delivered though. God converted Saul with a Donkey, and if no one praised him he could have made the rocks call out. Fact is if God has a message that needs to be delivered He is perfectly capable of making sure it is delivered(look at Jonah) the only person that loses out is the messenger that was given the glorious pleasure of speaking Gods words.   This isn't something I say lightly either. Being a mouth piece for God is the whole reason I was born. My mother couldn't even conceive until she said hana's prayer. At four years old I turned the opinion of a church who believed i was to young to be baptized, including my grandfather who was a gifted pastor. So its pretty much my whole reason for being. Knowing God doesn't need us was a bit of a problem from me. till i looked at it as who cares if he needs us, he's letting us deliver messages for him.   Never the less, our actions do have consequences. A pastor or leader who fails to deliver the message as given to him waters down his flock, until it becomes weak and breaks apart. God will take people under your care and place them in the care of others. The message is out there that God hates sin. The problem is no one is listening, and the wrong people are preaching the message. How should people take us seriously if we have people dishonoring funerals and threatening to set them selfs on fire(if your going to make a threat at least follow threw so people can see your conviction.)

Instead, you have to understand that, no matter who you are and no matter what you have done (past tense), you can be redeemed through an understanding that Jesus loves you (or, in other words, that you are worthy of love and can have your sins forgiven).

For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.   John 15:16 You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you.

The Confederate flag stands for something that the names of Broadas, et. al. do not. I think we should be fair to our past in acknowledging the sins in our forefathers, but also in realizing the important roles they play. Having the name of a past Baptist figure on a building doesn't project racism like a confederate flag flying in the present day does."

Story books can be a useful tool, but Scripture will provoke more pondering and conviction than even the best story books combined.

Christians,3avfr5,cjandstuff,3,Wed Jun 24 05:15:30 2015 UTC,"I have no particular attachment to the Confederate flag. But, I don't think Dr Moore's argumentation passes the consistency test   The Confederate States of America was not simply about limited government and local autonomy; the Confederate States of America was constitutionally committed to the continuation, with protections of law, to a great evil. The moral enormity of the slavery question is one still viscerally felt today, especially by the descendants of those who were enslaved and persecuted.   Let's apply that kind of reasoning elsewhere.   The United States of America is not simply about freedom and democracy; the United States of America is constitutionally committed to the continuation, with protections of law, to a great evil. The moral enormity of the abortion and imperialism questions is still viscerally felt today, especially by the communities those killed by and with the support of the US government.   Moore grounds his defense of the US flag in that the US did eliminate slavery. That's one evil. It hasn't eliminated the arguably greater evil of the abortion genocide. Done murders in the third world are still ongoing. There's just as much cause, by Moore's reasoning, to say ""the cross and the US flag cannot co-exist without one setting the other on fire.""  Further,   The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary was not simply about Biblical truth and training ministers; the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary was foundationally committed to the continuation, with endorsement of the convention, of allowing missionaries to own slaves. The moral enormity of the slavery question is one still viscerally felt today, especially by the descendants of those who were enslaved and persecuted.   The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary exists because slaveholders needed a separate seminary. Buildings on its campus bear the names of Boyce, Broadus, and Manly, three slaveholding founders of the institution. To be consistent, Moore ought to call for the renaming of those buildings at the seminary where he formerly taught (EDIT: Or come up with a better argument)."
Christians,3avfr5,b3k,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:41:32 2015 UTC,"I am personally indifferent to the removal of any flag. This is not my home, but I look to a heavenly city. But after thinking about this issue and watching the different reactions of people, I am left puzzled about why Russell Moore and his followers are crusading for an action that really only makes sense in the context of the Church, not secular government. The only reason we should not display a flag or ""eat meat offered to idols"" is when it causes another Christian brother to stumble, or if it creates a barrier to the spread of the gospel. Removing this flag, in its purely secular and worldly context, will help in neither of those contexts and will have no affect on the real heart of the issue, which is the sin of racism. Also, Moore's demand to remove the flag seems very opportunistically timed. The North Carolina shooting obviously has nothing to do with the Confederate flag, yet Moore has used this tragic event as a platform for his agenda. I have a problem with that, especially because as I said, the flag's removal will have no affect on the proclamation of the Gospel, nor will it lessen the sin of racism. Also, the whole thing is ironic because the Southern Baptist Convention was formed over disagreement about slavery, which the SBC supported. Southern Seminary buildings still bear the names of dedicated slaveholders. Are those names going to be removed from those buildings?"

Christians,3aqk27,DjKnux,5,Mon Jun 22 18:23:20 2015 UTC,"God addresses these sorts of things at the heart and neighbor level. And it doesn't matter what the substance is. It could be alcohol, marijuana, sex, food, money. It really doesn't matter what it is, though each substance differs in the severity, power, and consequences of its affects. Let me share two Bible verses with you to try and explain this:  First, on a heart level:   it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of the mouth; this defiles a person.” (Matthew 15:11 ESV)   Second, on a neighbor level:   “Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?” And he said to him, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor (any other person) as yourself. (Matthew 22:36-39 ESV)   So on a heart level, we would want to ask ourselves questions like, am I attached to x? Does x consume my thoughts and desires? Does x control my thoughts and actions, instead of controlling myself with actions that serve and love God? Do I thirst for x more than I thirst for righteousness? Do I look to x for happiness rather than God? Do I crave the pleasure of x more than I crave the true joy and contentment that comes from serving God? If I can answer yes to these questions, then x is is causing me to sin by the love of myself instead of God.  On a neighbor level, we would want to ask ourselves questions like, does x help me to serve people around me better? Does x endanger the livelihood and wellbeing of those around me, either by x's physical properties, or by the negligence exercised when I enjoy x? Does x endanger the the physical and/or mental health of those around me? If I can answer yes to these questions, then x is causing me to sin by the love of myself instead of my neighbor.  So sin is a matter of choosing one's service of self over service of God and others. Hope that helps. Feel free to ask followup questions."

You mean a closer connection with God? There are a lot of religions that equate strong feelings and emotions with spiritual experiences. In fact, when the Christian church first started, the church at Corinth had a problem with pagan religions which used sexual pleasure as a vehical for spiritual experience. And there are numerous other religions that equate spiritual experience with physical feeling. While the Bible does speak of physical experience being associated with spiritual experience, it never speaks of it in relationship to external substances or sexual encounters. The Bible always talks about a relationship with God through the study and application of the Scripture, daily prayer, the work of the Holy Spirit, the preaching and teaching of His Word, and the fellowship and encouragement with other Christians. Outside of those means, there are no other means to experience a true relationship with God. While powerful, the pleasurable effects of marijuana, sex, alcohol, etc. should not be confused with spiritual experience of the living God of the Bible."

We know marijuana effects the physical and has little to do with the spiritual aspect. I feel that it has allowed me to treat my body in a healthier way, and have patience with other people. Also marijuana is sort of a social cultural thing where we sit around and smoke as friends. Besides the bible group that I've now joined, I don't know any other thing that gathers people in a cirlce(pass the pipe around) and gets people to open up to new ideas.   I was telling my Gf that no marijuana is not the answer but she now understands that it's a beautiful tool and I'm glad we understand it. Maybe when we hangout with those friends we can even hopefully open them up to the word of god.   So maybe the intentions weren't the same as before but I feel like we are lucky enough to understand it and reach a different type of people especially how the Sunday classes teach us how to become disciples and spread the word.

Back during all of the Gospel Coalition accusations of antinomianism, I felt that folks were too hard on him. At the time I thought that Tullian was being careless or too creative with his teaching on grace, but wasn't necessarily teaching false doctrine. However, just re-reviewing some of his material, as well as some statements he recently made about ministry vs. business, and the unrepentant spirit of his post-announcement twitter feed and elsewhere, I am inclined by this fruit to think that he although he may be a Christian (although his lack of public repentance thus far is concerning), he is a false teacher. The Lord Jesus never taught grace apart from the pursuit of holiness and the cutting off sin. Yes, it is all by grace, yes we are free, yes there is no condemnation in Christ, but that grace is never separate from an active faith that prayerfully wars against the flesh. Ephesians states clearly that God's grace is seen through His workmanship to walk in good works. From everything I have read of Tullian, he lacks this balance. He lacks discernment about the temptations and dangers of the world, and is himself unable to warn and exhort others of these dangers. Sadly, he seems to be a victim of his own teaching.   The whole situation is just terribly sad. And not just just this disappointment, but the state of Christianity in the West. We so desperately need the mercy of God."

I know there were other issues that the Confederacy cited as justification for the Civil War.  And of course many in the North were pro-slavery.  Lincoln was a maze of contradictions on the subject.  I'm not pro-Union, either; they had been a part of a country where chattel slavery was legal until the War.  None of which, to me, matters.  It doesn't really matter why the war was fought, even.  If it was states' rights alone, Christians still shouldn't fly a Confederate flag.  It offends people, and not with the Gospel.  Whatever the war was about, the Confederacy was a ""country"" that defended and maintained an absolutely terrible, wretched, ungodly institution.  I don't know how anyone could read the recorded narratives of slaves, read Frederick Douglass or even Booker T. Washington's accounts, and come away thinking that the men who participated in and perpetuated such evil were representative of Christ.  Such evils should be called out and denied and if the people of the Confederacy were Christians, they should have been willing to lay down their lives to rescue the slaves, not to defend their own ""rights"" of government.  It doesn't matter what it would have done to the South's economy or how well people treated their slaves; the injustice should have been righted immediately.  If the Civil War trampled on state rights, praise God for trampling on foolish states that thought they had the right to enslave people.  Maybe the Union was unjust, but, like Babylon, God can use unjust peoples in order to punish people who claim His name while doing hideous works.  Four of my ancestors died fighting for the Confederacy.  More were slave traders.

But, when you start asking questions you quickly come to realize that they know almost nothing about the God of the bible. They wish to have one foot in the world and the other foot in their view of Christianity. That flag bears no witness of Christ and it offends millions.

Its slightly more than that.

I also know that there are many Christians who have read a rather low percentage and have great biblical knowledge and how to apply what they know.  I would encourage anyone to read the Bible cover to cover if they asked, but I would also highly suggest that they get into a systematic bible study instead of a cover to cover reading. Its my belief that a systematic bible study will be more of a use to a person than a cover to cover reading."

First, they said we needed to love more and show acceptance for gays, lesbians, trans, name-your-sexual-devianants and now they say that love and acceptance isn't good enough.

On topic, I'm happy that my former-ish denomination will stand up for God's ethics and marital and sexual righteousness. There is one thing that's bugging me however. This resolution says nothing about Christian businesses catering to homosexuals or not. Maybe it's that the section on the rights of Christians is too vague when put together with the section about loving those who disagree.

Christians,3a28gu,chimneytop,6,Tue Jun 16 17:36:36 2015 UTC,"The way to begin, I think, is to acknowledge that what we have in these situations isn't ""marriage"" at all. You can't ""divorce"" when you aren't even married. And incidentally, this one of many reasons I believe homosexual couples should not be allowed to adopt. At any rate, scripture is pretty clear that believers actively living in a sinful way need to stop. Ideally, the church would help make provision at that point if there is a financial shortfall. Overall it might not be pretty, because the consequences of sin are, let's face it, pretty grim.   I kind of doubt this situation occurs too often though."

Christians,3a28gu,FT4M,2,Wed Jun 17 03:27:18 2015 UTC,"I've been wondering about what the church should do with gay/lesbian couples, who are married, that come to Christ after they are wed by the state.   The church, obviously, cannot recognize their marriage. Whatever arrangement the couple has with the state should be disposed of according to a case-by-case consultation with their elders.   Let's say they also have adopted kids and one spouse is the bread winner and the other the caretaker.   Then the caretaker has a responsibility to continue taking care and the bread winner to continue winning bread in the near term. If this, though, would mean the couple has a strong temptation to fall back into such a besetting sin, then their local church has a responsibility to help win bread and to help care take in such a way that will relieve this burden until a permanent resolution can be accomplished (according to a case-by-case consultation with their elders).  This is a similar approach to what I think should be done in the case of a converted sex worker. He or she and maybe children still must be fed. In this case the church is required to step in an support them until she can support herself and her children, and further to support those children until she should find a Christian husband.   Should a church allow them membership but deny leadership if they don't divorce yet still admit their sin?   I would not think so. Sort of like how the new polygamist convert has enough to worry about that he ought not be in leadership."

Romans 8:28 and so on.  My question is, we see a number of times in Scripture where God seems to work in a startling, scientifically miraculous way.  Parting the Red Sea.  The cloud / fire that followed the Israelites' camp.  The oil that didn't ever run out.  The many, many accounts of resurrections and healings, in both Old Testament and New.  The Resurrection, of Christ.  Our resurrection, to come.  Genesis presents itself as one of those plainly-miraculous moments.  God spoke, and there WAS.  As Hebrews 11:3 puts it,    By faith we understand that the universe was created by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things that are visible.   The universe was created by the word of God--just like it says in Genesis, He spoke--and created the world (what is seen) out of things that are not visible (i.e. nothing).  Scripture would seem to put Genesis 1-2 in the same category of startlingly supernatural as the other miracles, not God orchestrating everything behind the scenes.  To me, it seems easier to believe in something-from-nothing than to believe in some of the other miracles, like the resurrection.  Why do you think Genesis 1-2 is a ""God set it up to happen"" rather than a miracle like the others?  Modern science avidly disbelieves in the Resurrection, too.  But without the Resurrection, we have no Christianity at all."

It's that neat, tidy package of theology called ""Calvinism"" that I'm not quite on board with. I think the best way I can summarize my take on the dilemma is by the use of ""The Parable of the Wedding Banquet"" in Matthew 22:1-14.  In that parable, the invitation was ultimately extended to all, but not everyone responded. Only those who did respond, and put on the appropriate garments, were found acceptable in the end. In a ""Calvinist"" version of this story, the King would have taken hold of select, unwilling individuals, at which point they become willing, put the garments on them, and called the wedding to order. This is basically the problem I have with it. I see the gospel being offered to any who believe, and those who do believe are ""chosen."" The Calvinist message seems to be that Jesus is not knocking at our hearts, but rather breaking in on them forcefully. Calvinists think this is necessary because they believe that given the choice, humans will always oppose a decision to serve Christ. This of course leads to the assumption that God didn't mean that He ""so loved the world,"" or that He ""is not willing that any should perish."" And yet, much of Scripture exhorts us to seek God out.  I affirm original sin, and a secure salvation that cannot be lost once gained. But I have not yet found a compelling reason why a human being should be held responsible for not responding to the gospel, unless they are in fact able to make that choice. Calvinists tend to say that makes for a ""works-based"" faith, as if merely accepting God's salvation was a work. It is not, so I don't think that objection holds water."

We do indeed preach the invitation to all. Some are good soil some are not. That's not for us humans to judge. It is Gods will that it is good and right for all to repent and believe. Just like it is Gods will that all should be faithful, not adulterous, and not murderers. We know it is Gods will that murder is wrong and yet He allows/ordains murder, even the murder of His son. It's His will that none should perish yet for reasons in Himself He destined some to receive what is preached and others to reject the preaching of to ever even hear but receive the fate that was sealed in Eden, the flood, and Babel.    However He does truly love the world in that members of every tribe and tongue and nation will be saved"

Christians,3a1s9k,Odous,3,Tue Jun 16 19:27:40 2015 UTC,God showed me He existed so that ended the atheist debate. Wondered if that was incompatible with evolution so I started looking more into that. It was primarily evolutions complete lack of evidence that new information had been added to an existing species' DNA. Transitioned to theistic evolutionist because 'science' had still brainwashed me into timelines and millions of years. By that time I was really into the subject and found out all its assumptions and circular reasoning. Was then just old earth because of non-biology reasons but then again more study in the college years as a hobby and found little to no compelling reasons for an old earth but a much more compact and clear structure for young earth if you can just imagine a preflood earth without rain but a water canopy as described in Gen 1

I stopped believing in evolution because the evidence is against it.  It made i possible for me to believe in a more literal interpretation of Genesis which made it possible for me to reaffirm and trust Genesis as divinely inspired after I had bouts of agnosticism.  Fish give birth to fish. Extrapolating that simple observation, we see it is unlikey fish will evolve to be birds!  Life does not arise from non life.  Dead dogs stay dead dogs.

Now I take a sterile needle, and I poke that cell, and all its stuff leaks out into this test tube.

Reading a bit further reveals that the Catholic Church does not consider Muslims saved. Rather, their orientation toward the worship of God (even a false reflection of the true God) might allow for the smooth transition into the proper worship of God through Jesus Christ.  The document is merely stating that Muslims are already religious and so they might become appropriately religious sooner than an unbeliever. I happen to disagree with that sentiment. But it's not as bad as the heresy that seems to be present in the isolated quotation above.  ""Whatever good or truth is found amongst them is looked upon by the Church as a preparation for the Gospel...Wherefore to promote the glory of God and procure the salvation of all of these, and mindful of the command of the Lord, 'Preach the Gospel to every creature',the Church fosters the missions with care and attention.""  -Lumen Gentium 16"

However, I still think he brings out good points. I would summarize his view in being that the kingdom is the place where God's reign breaks through into the world. A king enacts his will on his domain. So God's kingdom is the place where His will is happening in the world.   I find that definition to be a little broad. I wouldn't be surprised if Nugent hasn't refined it by now."

I would struggle with that definition because I see Scripture teaching that God's will is always happening everywhere. God even accomplishes His perfect and good will through evil, Christ's death on the cross being the most obvious example. I think I would append that definition and say that God's kingdom on earth is the place where God's will through the good news of the gospel is happening in the world. So in that context the kingdom of God would be both in our hearts and also seen in the outward manifestation of gospel-driven acts of obedience to Christ's teachings by His disciples."

However, one is allowed to respectfully discuss alternative views.   Respect and understanding that it is an alternative seem to be at the core. If you plan to try to convince anyone of, say, Darwinian evolution, you'll probably have as much luck on the internet (and on what I do not think would be offended to be called a literalist Christian subreddit) as anti-vaxxers will have on a pro-vaccination sub; you're going to annoy folks and ruffle feathers and that's about it.

Christians,39bibk,lju1977,8,Wed Jun 10 22:18:59 2015 UTC,"I'd like to give another point of view, one that holds the authority of the Bible in the highest regard.  Homosexuality in all its expressions is a form or consequence of sin. Homosexual sex is sin, homosexual relationships are sinful.  However, at the same time, I think that Christians sometimes conflate legality with morality (saying that something should be legal if it's right and illegal if it's wrong). The same I think happens here: the bible teaches that homosexuality is wrong to the point of being outlawed by the Levitical covenant.  However that doesn't matter to the non-Christian population. From their point of view, the most important thing is not whether or not they practice homosexuality but rather the most important thing is that they find Jesus. I'd go even further and claim that their sin is so great that homosexuality is practically the least of their problems.  Don't get me wrong, I know what Christian marriage is: an institution ordained by God between one consenting man and one consenting woman, at the exclusion of all others for as long as they both shall live to create a new family unit characterised by love within which children are born and raised and brought into relationship with God, the man laying down his life for his wife and the woman laying down her authority for the man.  But marriage according to the state is NOT this. The prominence of divorce means that already what is happening in marriages are not marriage.   What this means is that we have two different things, both called marriage: one which I described before and the other is ""a sign of affection for another person which has legal benefits"".  Gay marriage advocates are after the second definition to be included in this. They seek protection that the legal institution sets up.  I am against homosexuality. I am against homosexual relationships. I am not against homosexuals. I believe that they also deserve mercy and protection, regardless of how they've rejected God.  I am against homosexual marriage for Christians. Christians should not be in homosexual relationships in any form, but they should still love those that are, although not to the point of condoning their relationship.  And I think it's a reasonable view to have that upholds the Bible's teachings (within context)."
Christians,39bibk,DVDV28,8,Thu Jun 11 02:10:57 2015 UTC,"I would disagree quite strongly. First, ""Christians"" who are coming out for gay marriage are not making this argument. Secondly, the culture is not seeking the same tax and legal benefits as marriage for homosexuals. They are seeking to redefine marriage so as to destroy what it is. Finally, Christians are not legislating morality when we stand for Biblical marriage. The divorce, infedelity, and porn use rates bare witness to that. Christians very simply saying you can't legislate round squares or circles with 3 sides. Nor can a secular society say marriage is something other than marriage with the same kind of natural law insanity as 3 sided circles.   My friend, I fear you have the bait of the world in your mouth on this issue, spit it out and swim away or else the hook will set in."
Christians,39bibk,DVDV28,4,Thu Jun 11 02:36:49 2015 UTC,"I know that my argument is not the same as those of most other ""christians"". I'm just saying that I believe that there is an argument that is aligned with Biblical principles.  And the motivation I think is different for different people. You are right in saying that some people just want Christian marriage to not exclude them. It is not all homosexuals but to those people, I would deny marriage in a Christian church or anything like that and have them restricted to a state marriage with the church making it very clear that their relationship is an abomination.   But I think that what is happening is not that marriage is being redefined and the old definition will disappear. As long as their are Bible believing Christians, there will remain a biblical view of marriage. What I do believe is happening is that marriage has now got two definitions: one that the secular world already operates in which is a human construct poorly modelled off the divine equivalent wherein people enter and leave willy-nilly and the other that I will defend to my grave that has been ordained by God.  I am 100% against the church marrying homosexuals. If homosexuals get married, it MUST be under the secular version and it must be clear that the two things are not the same at all.  Heck, if I had legislative control, I'd literally just give it a different name. You're right in saying it's not marriage. But there's something else that's also being called marriage at the moment where God is not considered. To that thing, I believe that homosexuals should be allowed to enter into.  I'm not a pastor, but to give you confidence in my sincerity, if I were, I would sooner go to prison than marry homosexuals in the eyes of God."
Christians,39bibk,TurlessTiger,3,Thu Jun 11 02:47:48 2015 UTC,"I certainly agree that God commands us to emulate Him in His love for sinners, while being careful to never accommodate sin. And I also have to concede that no-fault divorces and fairy-tale perceptions of ""happily ever after"" have already made a mess of the modern perception of what marriage is. Still, two wrongs don't make a right. I think that we have a civil duty to uphold what is truly good in the law, as well as in person. It's not that I want some kind of theocracy—I don't think anyone here does. However, I don't see how we can in good conscience not uphold Godly principles in our representative government.  As a for-instance, consider adoption. I believe that we would be doing a disservice to kids needing adoptive parents by giving equal footing to homosexual partners as true married couples. It seems to me that permitting the state to call something a marriage when it is not leads directly to that sort of thing, which as you might expect, I actively oppose. Unfortunately, the world sees that as unloving, but it's a conviction I hold nonetheless."
Christians,39bibk,faintpremonition,3,Thu Jun 11 02:39:02 2015 UTC,"This is a common idea you'll encounter in America. America politically separates church and state. Many Christians take that to mean since America is not a Christian nation we should divide our political life and views and our Christian life and views. I can find no Biblical support for that.  I understand the counter argument that you ""can't legislate morality."" I disagree. You absolutely can. What people mean by that argument is that you can't have perfect enforcement. That's fine, and that's not relevant to whether or not your laws should drive moral behavior. We should legislate morality, and we should strive, in our war against sin, to drive sin underground, out of public life and culture, and relegate it to the darkness where it belongs. And we should continue to pursue it, storming into the darkness and showing sin no mercy. We owe it tot he people we are called to love and witness to use every tool we can get our hands on to bring forth right and justice, because people need mercy, and sin will show them none."
Christians,39bibk,chimneytop,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:23:15 2015 UTC,I disagree. Check out Bastiat's The Law for a good reason why not.
Christians,39bibk,faintpremonition,1 point,Thu Jun 11 11:29:59 2015 UTC,"I don't get along with Bastiat because I think his core assumptions are flawed. One of the problems I have with his line of reasoning is he assumes that in a perfect, minimal legal system of his own devising, people would behave nobly, rationally, and respect themselves and their fellows in common understanding of why the law is so permissive.  I think that's an unrealistic view of human nature. I also don't buy his assertion that property and liberty are fundamental rights that are intrinsic to actualized personhood. His thoughts on ""legal plunder"" are also naive. Unrestricted ability to trade is how you get, for example, the market crash that lead to the Depression. Now we have systems in place to shut the whole works down before we wind up in a death spiral. This is also similar to the function of protective tariffs. Individuals all seeking to operate in righteous self interest can crash a market and ruin themselves and everyone else, and you need a detached stronger collective party to prevent that kind of ruthless self interest.  I'm for guided capitalism. As we've seen time and again, people are a little too stupid and too selfish to be allowed free reign. Economists are not clairvoyant and powerful markets are happy to salt their own earth to make short term profits. I'm not for a state managed economy, because I think the state can be just as stupid and selfish, I think the great power of private industry and government should be pitted slightly against each other lest either run away and ruin everything.  So in conclusion, because I disagree with Bastiat's worldview and his analysis of human behavior I cannot find a reason good enough to convince me in The Law not to try and force law to align with God's proscribed behaviors.  As a Christian we believe that homosexual activity is sinful and thereful self destructive, and therefore harmful not helpful to society. I find it unreasonable to give this particular sin a free pass over other sins we are pleased to outlaw for the health of the nation."

I do stand by the thrust of Bastiat's argument though and view government's only job as preventing people from causing physical or economic harm to each other or property. The main reason is because I expect traditional Christianity will not even hold a plurality in the US within the next 20 years, and I don't want my beliefs and my church's ability to refuse to marry people compromised because a majority think suck an act is bigoted.  Secondly, divorce and remarriage is legal. Porn is legal. These are sexual sins out gov. tolerates. Why draw the line with homosexuality?

I'm not really prepared to have that discussion, because I don't know myself when I think it's okay to compromise for a attempt at achieving a greater good. It's a valid concern, absolutely.  I would exhort you not to let defeatism and pessimism color your beliefs, however. The church is a fighter when its people have the will to fight!

Paul said it wasn't his job to judge those outside of the church, and I agree with him.   I'm not in favor of any of those things being legal, although I must admit I would need to study further to have an informed opinion on when and if divorce and remarriage is ever morally acceptable.  I'm absolutely not saying America's current government has correctly legislated the issues it should and should not, and we're about to make the first mistake on homosexual marriage. I think tolerating the sexual sin of pornography is a staggering failure of law that does real measurable harm to our cultural fabric. Unfortunately the best way to fight against it is not with the law because the law has long since moved on from that front. We need major cultural restoration before we could bring the laws on porn back into union with the Faith.  Thanks for the thoughtful discussion. I will have to do some studying and try to figure out what Jesus, US voter would do. He certainly showed no interest in political reformation or revolution in his ministry.

Christians,39bibk,chimneytop,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:20:19 2015 UTC,"To just drive the point home, I'll ask if your cultural identity is primarily Christian or American? Christ makes it clear that the world will hate us for our beliefs. American culture = the world. Think of Glee, Modern Family, the backlash against the Indiana pizza place, etc. These events and shows are voices, opinions and entertainment valued by large swaths of the country. Is it our job to police these cultural exchanges on a macro level? I don't think so. I think christianity and Christian morals need to be handled on the micro between individuals. I know many non-Christians who view the work of culture warriors as arrogant and bullying, but these same people are willing to share a beer with me and talk about traditional Christianity."
Christians,39bibk,faintpremonition,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:10:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think Christianity is cultural identity, as it transcends cultures, so I'm having trouble parsing it as an either or question. I guess you could say that my Christian culture supersedes the mundane aspects of my WASPy American culture.  The world may absolutely hate us for our beliefs, but I don't think we allow that to cause us to shrink from important fights. Culture warriors can be arrogant, and bullying, and that's certainly been a tool for culture jamming successfully pulled off by pro homosexual advocates. But that doesn't mean you have to, or even should be that why while still fighting the culture war. People doing a thing badly doesn't mean the thing is intrinsically bad.  You are right that that there is huge value in interpersonal witness. In fact I think most effective missions work proselytizes through lifestyle and relational sharing of the gospel. I don't think that things like public debates, or legislation win people into the eternal kingdom. No one ever won a debate so hard a soul was redeemed.  However I don't think that's relevant to how we should view law. Proselytizing isn't for evalnism, and criticising it for being a poor evangelical tool misses its intended purpose. Moral laws are for the health and welfare of society's temporal health, not its spiritual health.  As a Christian I believe that living in accordance with God's rules is the best and healthiest way to live. By permitting or encouraging sinful behaviors we sicken our society. Even if they don't believe us. Even if they can't detect the effects of their sin. This is why I'm uncompromising on the matter. It's not because I think that controlling behaviors will save souls, it's because I believe law exists to serve societal health, and I know that, despite the protests from people who don't believe me, that it's not healthy for the society.  My culture warrior hero is King Alfred the Great. Alfred drew no distinction between his spiritual authority and his political authority. He was the Christian king of his people's minds, bodies, and souls and he went to tremendous lengths to defend, educate, and serve his people.  I think he would have also found abhorrent the idea that since the people were very committed cultural to a particular sin that they should just be permitted to baste in the broth of their wrongdoing.  Your comments on Glee and other media bring up another tendril of this discussion that I care passionately about. Christian presence in media, art, entertainment and culture is pretty weak, and that is a failing.  We used to dominate culture and art, and that was a fantastic tool in Christian evangelism. I do think we should be policing shows like Glee, I think we should be out competing them with superior entertainment. I mean, come on, Glee is so bad. How is so much Christian media even worse? I've never seen a show go from being incredibly enjoyable to trash within a single season like Glee did. They didn't even make it past their mid season break before the writing fell to absolute pieces!  But that's another topic."
Christians,39bibk,gage_deity,2,Thu Jun 11 21:29:39 2015 UTC,Good post.
Christians,39bibk,Dying_Daily,2,Thu Jun 11 07:32:02 2015 UTC,"This sounds a lot like Ron Paul, who, as much respect as I have for the man, and is probably a Christian himself, is misguided with his ""don't legislate morality"" philosophy. Legislating morality is exactly the point of legislation. It is to make fair what is unfair, right what is wrong, protect the innocent and punish the guilty, etc. etc. The issue of marriage transcends religion, just as many other moral issues, and it has to be legislated towards what is fair and right, just like every other moral issue. Now as to what level of government that legislation should happen, that is another discussion, but regardless, marriage must be legislated for the fairness, justice, and good of the people."
Christians,39bibk,injoy,2,Thu Jun 11 11:19:11 2015 UTC,"I have often found this argument compelling, honestly.  But when it came down to actually voting for or against gay marriage in our state--I voted against it, feeling like a closed-minded totalitarian full of internal conflict even as I did so.    The state DOES define morals.  It says killing people is wrong.  Thievery is wrong.  Slavery is wrong.  Even hitting people is wrong.  These are all moral issues, and some of them are ones that haven't always been on the ""right"" side legally speaking (I mean, slavery has been legal, but immoral; hitting slaves/wives/children has been legal, but immoral; etc.).  A good government chooses morals that follow after God's morals -- Romans 13:3 says, "" a terror to bad conduct,"" and what is ""bad conduct"" if not a question of morality?  In the next verse, Paul says, the government is ""a minister of God to you for good, but if you do what is evil, be afraid... it is a minister of God, an avenger who brings wrath on the one who practices evil...""  In other words, not only is government in fact a moral force, God actually designed it that way.  God designed governments to defend good and bring wrath on evil, for believers and nonbelievers alike.  Second consideration, sin leads to punishment.  Giving sinners legal protections for their sin on earth is only increasing their punishment in hell.  That is not kind or compassionate, much less merciful and protective.  Third, by being a government ""of the people,"" our very government structure itself invites the people to determine the morals.  If the people want to abolish slavery, abolish slavery.  By simply backing out of these issues, give people the legal ability to sin, we aren't being good citizens.  Fourth, and finally, marriage is a different issue, anyway, because marriage was created by God as a testament.  Ephesians 5.  ""For this reason,"" Paul says [Christ and the church], "" a man shall leave his father and his mother...""  Marriage is a piece of common grace that displays the gospel, and homosexual marriage is a perversion of that picture.  It's not merely sin, it's sin that distorts the gospel for everyone that encounters it.  And that is why sixty years ago, the church was just as anti-divorce as they are now anti-homosexual-marriage.  People have just forgotten that little bit of history, as we lost the war.  But Christians fought avidly against divorce laws."

With all due respect, this is a gross oversimplification. Myself and others have spent a great deal of time in subs like /r/Christianity and have tried to make it work. I just want a place where I can talk to likeminded folks and be encouraged and not worry about constant debate. This isn't going to happen in the other subs, and that's why I created this place.   and fragment into smaller subs.   Honestly, the size of a sub makes no difference to me. If I had a sub with two people, and that one person encouraged me and strengthened my faith in Christ, that would be a great benefit to me and more glorifying to God.   It happened with r/Christianity and is now happening with r/TrueChristian.   The condition of the subs is the result of the way the mods shape it. It has nothing to do with who leaves. The mods shape this sub how they want it, and it attracts likeminded individuals. The leaders are 100% responsible for this. This is how all communities work.   I think conservative Christians need to stop fearing opposing views and learn to confront them. Lest we retreat and disperse ourselves into extinction.   I think I can speak for myself and others by saying that the creation of this particular sub is not out of a fear of opposing views. In fact, I welcome them. What I don't welcome is harrassment, disrespect, immature behavior, and incessant debate of elementary biblical truths. Granted, /r/Christianity in particular has improved with the removal of toxic moderators, but in general, it's the same rehashing of the same biblical topics. There is also an absence of focus on glorifying God, His Word, and exhorting one another.   Biblically speaking, the strength of any Christian community is through unity of belief, not diversity. I wrote a short explanation of that biblical teaching here. So the primary purpose of this sub is for biblical encouragement, strengthening, and exhortation, not as a meeting place for every group that claims to be Christian. So if you're looking for a melting pot of Christian religion, this is not that place. We are a strictly defined, Reformational Christian subreddit, so we won't be able to offer you lots of diverse views. What we do offer is love and respect for everyone, a deep love for Christ, a commitment to obeying His Word, and a strong stance on the one gospel."

Christians,39bqjd,Dying_Daily,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:26:50 2015 UTC,"What about having secular gay marriage?   It seems to me that separation of church and state is a real thing. In that regard, gay marriage should already exist. I'm not talking about what the Bible says about marriage, but rather what is allowed in our society. I agree with what the Bible says about marriage. However, I don't see why that means secular gay marriage can't happen.  Someone else brought this up in /r/truechristianity recently. I think it's compelling. And they didn't seem like a liberal.   Normal protestant Christianity says that we have to oppose gay marriage at every turn.  But I'm skeptical. For various reasons....   All churches should be welcoming of everyone, but there is a difference between welcoming and affirming.    I get what you're saying. I do. The only problem is that this is mere church speak. It's great if you're already in the fold. But to everyone else on the outside, it just looks like we're denying their opportunity to get married by constantly voting down gay marriage bills. No one believes that the church cares at all about homosexuals.  This culture war has been going on for years and years and years. It will never end until gay marriage becomes legal. The reason is because there are other people that live in America besides Christians. Not everyone is going to believe like we do. Why would non Christian homosexuals stop fighting for gay marriage? They won't because most of them are never going to become Christians just like many other groups of people. It's a losing battle.   And I'm not so sure that gay marriage legality affirms anything. As long as churches are not forced to do them then there should be a compromise somewhere."

Paragraph 8. ""...true to the true nature"" is repetitive. I'd suggest dropping the second ""true"" as it sort of insinuates that Christ has a false nature.   *Minor suggestion in the first sentence of paragraph 8. Change ""purify"" to ""sanctify."" I think it's fine as is, but ""sanctify"" is more universally used.  Paragraph 8. The last 4 sentences are inconsistently directed. We, we, you, you assumes differing sets of group and personal desires.  Paragraph 9 first sentence. ""However"" is not necessary and draws out the sentence. If you want to keep the word itself for word-count purposes then add ""however"" to the beginning. Ex: ""However, we will stumble because nobody is perfect.""  Paragraph 9 second sentence. Replace the comma with a period and make ""but"" the beginning of a new sentence.  Paragraph 11. Paragraphs are typically 3-5 sentences. Try to add more. Also, change ""So now we know that even when we stumble, there is always a way to get back on track again and again want to live for God."" to ""So we know now that we will stumble. Because of God's forgiveness, He provides a way for us to get back on track. But our love for Christ will continue to compel us to live for Him if we truly claim to be His disciples.""  Paragraph 13. Your first sentence leads the reader to believe you haven't been completely honest so far. I would just start the paragraph with something like ""This is the definition of ""exhort""...""   Paragraph 13 sentence 3. ""Exhort"" isn't just for church leaders. However, church leaders are held to a higher standard. So it should state that the youth pastors will be held more accountable before God for the exhorting of others.  Paragraph 13 sentence 4. This is a bit confusing to read. Example suggestion: ""Remember that Titus's deacons, elders, and the Apostle Paul were much older than Titus.""  Paragraph 13 sentence 5. The sentence is longer than needed. You can also divide it in to two sentences. I would reword it in this way: ""For this reason Paul had told him to speak with authority. Also, He emphasized that Titus should speak in a way that would glorify Christ and keep in line with His teachings.""  I would also add one more paragraph that sums up everything.  I am not a professional editor in any sense of the term and I have not been to college. However, I have read a lot of books and write my own sermons (although I'm not a church leader). Take my suggestions with a grain of salt. The key thing is to remain consistent in reference to your audience. Also, you'll want to cite a verse every time you make a claim about scripture unless it's already been covered. Try not to assume everyone knows what you referring to at first.

The necessity for violence is real, but our individual theological convictions must guide us on this issue. I would never commit violence against someone on my own behalf or on the behalf of a Christian, but I would have no qualms about shooting someone who was threatening a non-believer's life.

In Acts the Roman soldiers are also not commanded to make a career change. This, however, is not necessarily an encouragement to continue in violence. God needs people in all walks of life to bring the Gospel to people, but we should always do everything we can to present the Gospel to all men, that they would be without an excuse for unbelief.   If a violent man came into a Christian home in order to rape and murder and the father of the home does not respond with violence to protect those there, is he not complicit in the crimes?   Rape and murder are very different sins. Once again, if your family are believers, you should protect them as much as you can while keeping the violent unbeliever from mortal danger. If your family do not believe, they should be your priority.   These things are of course all subject to the prompting of the HS.

Submit to human institutions-  1 Peter 2:13-16:  Submit yourselves for the Lord’s sake to every human institution, whether to a king as the one in authority, or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and the praise of those who do right. For such is the will of God that by doing right you may silence the ignorance of foolish men.  Government as a just punisher of evil-  Romans 13:3-4:  For rulers are not a cause of fear for good behavior, but for evil. Do you want to have no fear of authority? Do what is good and you will have praise from the same; for it is a minister of God to you for good.

Also, consider the few verses before Romans 13: ""14 Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse them. 15 Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep. 16 Live in harmony with one another. Do not be haughty, but associate with the lowly. Never be wise in your own sight. 17 Repay no one evil for evil, but give thought to do what is honorable in the sight of all. 18 If possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all. 19 Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God, for it is written, “Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.” 20 To the contrary, “if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink; for by so doing you will heap burning coals on his head.” 21 Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good."" Romans 12:14-21 tells us to live at peace with others, including our enemies, and in fact that we should do things to help our enemies, not harm them. If we all applied these things to our personal lives, there should be no reason to ask how to behave in our collective social lives because we'd all be doing this anyway."

God doesn't excuse atheists because they don't believe in His son. I do. I believe He would excuse my ""lack of action"" because I'm doing it out of love for my ""enemy"". I remember looking at the rising smoke from the remains of the twin towers on 9-11-01, but I don't hold any hate for anyone, or any group of people.   Keep in mind, the reference in Romans 13 is also discussing individuals and whether they obey the authorities or not... ""For the one in authority is God’s servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for rulers do not bear the sword for no reason."" There's nothing in that section that references how Christians should interact with governmental authority on a communal level, but on a personal level. And no, I don't believe the government can go to war to bring the wrath of God on those who do evil. Are we supposed to look at the U.S. government's current war for evidence? How many innocent women and children have died? Maybe we can look at the Israel/Palestine conflict, there are more Christians in Palestine than Israel, should American Christians blindly stand beside Israel because that's what the government says we should do? How about China and Korea, it's illegal to be a Christian there, should we agree with the government and help them hunt down fellow Christians?"
Christians,3973t7,kdz13,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:30:57 2015 UTC,"In China it's illegal because they're persecuting Christians. The key difference between action and no action is persecution. Nonviolence always plays a role in persecution in Christ's name.   There have been many unjust wars I would not have fought in as a Christian. Clearly you've taken your pick.  But, obviously we see just wars in the Old Testament. So let's look at the definition of pacifism and pacifist.  Pacifism - the belief that any violence, including war, is unjustifiable under any circumstances, and that all disputes should be settled by peaceful means.  Pacifist - a person who believes that war and violence are unjustifiable  So, are the wars in the Old Testament justifiable? If you say they are then you by definition are not a pacifist and do not adhere to pacifism, you can adhere to nonviolence as a lifestyle, but you are misleading people by saying you're a pacifist. If you tell people you're a pacifist, then you're telling people God is unjust.  Now, let's look at the definition of violence:  Violence - the use of physical force to harm someone, to damage property, etc.  Going by definition, Jesus did a violent act in the temple. Now, as a pacifist you are not only saying the Old Testament wars were unjustifiable, but now you're saying the actions of Christ in the temple are unjustifiable as well.  I'm on my phone so I can't cover your entire post but I can expand later when I get home."

Nonviolence always plays a role in persecution in Christ's name.    I don't really know what you mean by all this but I'll give an example of my perspective. My wife's uncle Tim was a missionary to Colombia. He and a friend Steve were taken captive by the FARC for 17 months. During this time Tim and Steve would pray for and over their captives and their families. They never attempted to use violence to regain their freedom and they were eventually killed rather brutally. We know this because many years later a few letters have been received by Tim's wife from some of the people who were holding them. They recounted the loving nature of Tim and Steve while in captivity and the fact that there was at least one miraculous healing performed on a captive's family member. A few of the captives claim to be followers of Christ now because of the life Tim and Steve exemplified during captivity.   But, obviously we see just wars in the Old Testament.

I am a pacifist in that I don't believe there is any justification for violence or war in this age.   Going by definition, Jesus did a violent act in the temple. Now, as a pacifist you are not only saying the Old Testament wars were unjustifiable, but now you're saying the actions of Christ in the temple are unjustifiable as well.   I've made the case that the OT wars were justified by God's command and by the very nature of Jesus being the Christ he has the authority to remove people from the temple for doing things his Father deems abominable. Jesus' actions also caused no harm to any person and we have no actual record of what damage was or was not caused. We do, however, have Jesus commands to turn the other cheek, pray for those who persecute us and love our enemies.   Yes, to expect everyone to attempt to live out Romans 12 is idealistic folly, but isn't Christianity supposed to be about hoping against impossible odds and expecting God to work miracles?"

This a prime example of persecution and the nonviolence/prayer in response to it that I support completely. There is no way I would condone resistance in the face of persecution. I would never take up arms against anyone coming after me, my family, or another christian in the face of persecution because of Christ.   Yes, because God directly commanded or aided in these wars.

Per the definitions I put forward earlier, you are not a pacifist. The definitions do not say ""except God or Jesus."" Adding your own personal take does not change the definition. So when you talk to people about pacifism and they take it to heart, they're going to begin to wonder what it really means to adhere to pacifism. Generally the first thing people do when curious about this is look up the definition. So when people see the definition and read that wars and violence are completely unjustifiable under any circumstance, they're now going to question whether or not the God of the bible is a just God. Even if you mean well, the use of the term is a stumbling block and by it's very definition blasphemes God.   Yes, to expect everyone to attempt to live out Romans 12 is idealistic folly, but isn't Christianity supposed to be about hoping against impossible odds and expecting God to work miracles?   Why should I hope for something to happen that God says will not happen until His return? My hope is that as many people will come to faith in Christ as possible, but it will not be everyone.  While I don't agree with your understanding of a few passages, I admire the rare dedication to nonviolence you hold. I understand, though not fully in agreement with, the idea or understanding you put forth. But pacifism is a stumbling block and leaves atheists salivating. I used to be an atheist and I loved it when I heard a christian talk about it because it was one of the easiest ways to discredit christians in front of other people. Use the term nonresistance or something to that effect. Leave no room for the enemy."

As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed. (Galatians 1:8-9 ESV)   So the members of the Galatian church were not only to judge/discern the false teaching they were facing, but that teacher is accursed. If anyone teaches contrary to the Gospel, they are to let that person be accursed, and Christians are to discern and defend against such false teaching. Since we know what Pope John Paul taught was contrary to the Gospel, we are to let him be accursed, and we don't say that flippantly. It is an eternal life or death matter."

Ford Doolittle, 1980:  ""middle-repetitive DNAs together comprise too large a fraction of most eukaryotic genomes to be kept accurate by Darwinian selection operating on organismal phenotype"" Dan Graur, 2012:  ""Thus, according to the ENCODE Consortium, a biological function can be maintained indefinitely without selection, which implies that at least 80 – 10 = 70% of the genome is perfectly invulnerable to deleterious mutations, either because no mutation can ever occur in these “functional” regions, or because no mutation in these regions can ever be deleterious.   T. Ryan Gregory, 2014:  ""if the rate at which these mutations are generated is higher than the rate at which natural selection can weed them out, then the collective genomes of the organisms in the species will suffer a meltdown as the total number of deleterious alleles increases with each generation... [This is] incompatible with the view that 80% of the genome is functional in the sense implied by ENCODE."" Larry Moran, 2014:  ""if the deleterious mutation rate is too high, the species will go extinct... It should be no more than 1 or 2 deleterious mutations per generation.""     Humans get around 100 mutations per generation.  Functional DNA is highly specific, so almost all mutations that hit functional DNA are deleterious.  Thus in order for evolution to even be able to preserve instead of destroy, they argue that only a small, single-digit percentage of DNA is functional.

Christians,38j7bc,Dying_Daily,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:02:20 2015 UTC,Here's where I get confused. Are we baptized into the family of Israel or into the family of Abraham? And please any references to scripture would be helpful.
Christians,38j7bc,FloorDeKeys,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:01:25 2015 UTC,"For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh: But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God. Romans 2:28-29   We are grafted into the spiritual family of God's people, which is what Israel represents. The Jewish traditions are what led the Jewish nation astray from the word of God. They kept the letter of the law, but neglected to understand it's meaning and apply it to their characters. Our circumcision is of the heart... in our character and who we are as a person. We are obedient because of our salvation, not saved by our obedience.   Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not come at him for the press. And it was told him by certain which said, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee. And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God, and do it. Luke 8:19-21"
Christians,38j7bc,SquareHimself,2,Fri Jun 5 16:23:29 2015 UTC,"Well... My opinion is definitely not orthodox, so take it for what you will. If all you had of the New Testament were the gospels, and you performed a sola scriptura, you would end up concluding it was necessary to follow the Torah commandments, because Jesus commands you to in Matthew 5 and Matthew 23: 2-3, and in no other gospel does he contradict these teachings. (Teaching to believe in him doesn't necessarily contradict it.)  If you add Acts to the New Testament, then you have evidence of the church fathers teaching the gentiles that they don't have to keep the whole law in Acts 15. (This seems to be what they're saying, though the Hebrew roots would disagree.)  Then, if you add the remaining New Testament books, you get a general idea that Paul was teaching the gentiles that they don't have to keep the whole law for salvation. This is my interpretation.  It makes sense, because in Acts, after Jesus has been resurrected, the Christians are still attending synagogues on Saturdays, attending the feasts, and even sacrificing in the temple. This seems wrong and counterintuitive, and if the temple existed today, I would probably object to making animal sacrifices in it.  All in all, it would still make sense if upon Jesus' second coming, the fall feasts would then be fulfilled."
Christians,38j7bc,FloorDeKeys,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:55:26 2015 UTC,"and in no other gospel does he contradict these teachings.   Just a note about Mark 7 and Matthew 15, the Pharisees mention Jesus' disciples were eating with unwashed hands. This is not an OT commandment, but is in the tradition of the Pharisees. Jesus didn't see it equal with the other commandments, and then even criticized the Pharisees that their tradition sometimes interfere with the plain commandments in the OT. So he is clearly not saying you can break kosher here.  Mark 7:19 in most modern translations is just completely different from the original Greek. Almost all translations before about 1950 or so never have Jesus declaring all foods clean. It is a proposterous idea that he would criticize the Pharisees for breaking the law, then say to go ahead and break the kosher laws. Read this verse in any other language and even in KJV and NKJV.   Peter's dream in Acts 10 is said to be about the gentiles, not literally about food. This is reiterated in Acts 11.  The only other thing to talk about is the Sabbath. Jesus clearly never thought he or his disciples broke the Sabbath. He may have broke it according to the Pharisees, but Jesus was said to be sinless and could not have broken the Sabbath."
Christians,38i79m,Dying_Daily,2,Thu Jun 4 11:29:29 2015 UTC,"That's probably not a very helpful analogy.  Evolution is the change in heritable traits of biological populations over successive generations.  So, the Theory of Evolution only applies to living, biological populations.  How you believe life first started is a separate question:   did God create the first simple organism? did God create the first fish, bird, mammal, etc? did God create kinds as a literal reading of the Bible would say? did God set the universe in motion, and let natural law create the first life? did the first simple organism come about by abiogensis without God?   In all cases, evolution kicks in after life starts.  Points 1, 4 and 5 are only viable if macro evolution is true.  Point 3 only needs micro evolution (antibiotic resistence would be a fitting example here.  I think Ken Ham would class this as Natural Selection rather than evolution.  Darwinists would say that there is no difference between the two), and point 2 is likely to need some macro evolution, possibly.  Points 1, 2 and 3 would come under the classification of Intelligent Design.  Perhaps if you change ""evolution"" to ""atheistic world view"" you might be able to formulate a better analogy, because the atheistic world view really does have to explain life from non-life.  Edit: formatting"
Christians,38i79m,redfredred,0,Thu Jun 4 12:46:01 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Would the process of evolution begin without life from non-life?  Also, you seem to be coming from a theistic evolutionary perspective, which would be a separate discussion in itself. But the original evolutionary theory is encapsulated, and dependent upon, motivated by, and derived from a wholly atheistic worldview. That being said, whether or not God brought life from non-life is really irrelevant to the analogy, because in either scenario, life from non-life (and the events leading to that moment) is the beginning of evolution and in fact what makes evolution possible.   Just as one cannot have a computer without the plans and materials needed to create the first computer, one cannot have evolution without the plans and materials needed for the very first evolution. Not only is abiogenesis tangientially related to evolution, it is the very bedrock of what makes evolution possible. It should be no surprise then, that evolutionists are cleverly attempting to distance themselves from this fact and deceiving many with the notion that abiogenesis has nothing to do with evolution. Abiogenesis has everything to do with everything, except that creationism has the Biblical answer, which is that God has made everything with great wonder and amazement. Glory to God for His amazing design and engineering!"
Christians,38i79m,SoundsLikeGreatFun,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:05:07 2015 UTC,"The fact that life had to exist before evolution could begin is true, But- Abiogenesis can and necessarily does exist totally separate from and with no dependency on evolution.   So yes, Abiogenesis has no relationship with evolution.   Evolution does have a dependency on abiogenesis, but that's not a ""relationship"".  A relationship requires bi-directional interaction.  This is a simple one way dependency."
Christians,38i79m,SoundsLikeGreatFun,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:04:23 2015 UTC,"Abiogenesis can and necessarily does exist totally separate from and with no dependency on evolution.   Abiogenesis does not exist totally separate from evolution, and is in fact completely dependent upon it.  When abiogenesis occurred, evolution would have begun. Abiogenesis is the prerequisite to evolution. Without abiogenesis, evolution cannot begin."
Christians,38i79m,redfredred,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:11:21 2015 UTC,"Would the process of evolution begin without life from non-life?   OK, the question (as you have phrased it) assumes evolution happens, and is asking whether it would happen without life from non-life.  Working on that assumption, there are three possibilities:   life never started life started at some point life has existed for eternity   Point 1.  Evolution would not happen, because life does not exist.  Point 2.  Evolution would happen if evolution were true.  Point 3.  Evolution would happen if evolution were true.  Therefore, in the bounds of this question, evolution needs life, it does not need a beginning to life.  The atheistic world view needs to explain the beginnings of life, because we can all agree that life started at some point, but atheists don't have the Bible to guide them."

Christians,38ejsh,matt52490,2,Wed Jun 3 18:16:18 2015 UTC,"Good contribution. The heart of the matter here, I believe, is cowardice. If it's not cowardice it's ignorance because the man shows no fruit of genuine salvation and thus holds the bible in little or no regard. I have a big issue with every false Christian walking around because the whole situation mocks God and gives those who hate Him an opportunity to blaspheme Him. So now you've got men walking around professing a faith in Christ they don't have, letting their kids run amuck being sexually perverse in their teenage years, all in the name of ""judge not lest ye be judged"" and they don't even know what that verse means. So when studies come out it appears that God can save these people but He can't change their lives. So now they wonder how can this God have any real power when He can't keep the husband from cheating on his wife, keep him out of the bar, or keep him in church. But the rest of the church says ""he's just a carnal Christian, so let's keep church discipline out of this.""  Romans 1:21 For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened.  Sorry, this is a touchy subject for me. In families, the man will be held accountable, but that seems to have been a forgotten truth.  /rant"
Christians,38ejsh,FT4M,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:54:58 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. Many churches have been emasculated. They don't have the courage to stand up for what God's word clearly states because they are afraid of the disapproval from the world. Even on the subject of men being held accountable in their families, churches that have been overrun with feminist ideologies would find that idea extremely offensive."

We'll be doing ours at the end of June with the ""Journey Off the Map"" curriculum by LifeWay. It's essentially a jungle themed presentation of the gospel and some of the more well-known Biblical narratives.

Christians,387aqn,Dying_Daily,2,Tue Jun 2 11:47:39 2015 UTC,"Interesting points, and while I'm sure I could discuss all 6 in some sort of detail I want to focus on the first one, which is this:   Pastors are increasingly hired for their management skills or rhetorical ability over and above their biblical wisdom or their meeting of the biblical qualifications for eldership.   I honestly think that our modern qualifications and the actual Biblical qualifications are at conflict sometimes. People expect theology degrees, seminary training, etc etc etc. And yet the first preachers were average, uneducated people.   When they saw the courage of Peter and John and realized that they were unschooled, ordinary men, they were astonished and they took note that these men had been with Jesus. - Acts 4:13   You can develop an understanding of the Scriptures and possess the qualifications to lead a church without a seminary degree, and I think the church these days discredits a lot of qualified servants just because they don't have their doctorate in theology."
Christians,387aqn,Natetendo83,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:56:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, there is something to this. As a pastor who went to seminary, I certainly don't think that seminary training is a bad thing. But I do think we have lost something of an organic model where older pastors raise up and equip younger men in a church setting. The danger in seminary is that it is easy to talk big about models of church, leadership, etc. But separated from the actual church enviroment, it is usually counterproductive. How many fresh seminary grads have wrecked churches because the did not know what it was to shepherd the flock among them."

It is mind boggling and worthy of reverent contemplation and deep awe to think that while we were yet sinners and enemies of God, Jesus Christ, who was the Father's agent in creation, humbled Himself to the point of death, even death on a cross.  That He willingly bore my vile sins and in so doing bore the wrath of the Father which I so richly deserved so that He could clothe me in His righteousness.

Okay, non-mod participant here... :)  I'm /u/Dying_Daily's wife, I'm 31, stay-at-home-homeschool-mom of five and counting.  I went to school to be a public school teacher, but then moved to Kentucky while /u/Dying_Daily finished at SBTS, and Kentucky (at least at the time) paid their teachers much less than the programming job I fell into instead, and I enjoyed programming much more. :-)  The further away from college I get, the more I wish I had gone to some kind of Bible school and had the opportunity to take any theology courses, at all, and that's probably the biggest thing I hope to do differently with our kids, to give them the opportunity and encouragement to spend their college time studying Scripture.  In my ""free"" time I enjoy writing, embroidery, and sewing.  I used to enjoy knitting and crochet before I had toddlers to pull the needles out. ;-)"

Christians,382ikh,FT4M,3,Mon Jun 1 19:25:16 2015 UTC,Are you part of a Bible-believing church in England?  Is there one?
Christians,382ikh,pubmadison,3,Mon Jun 1 19:38:14 2015 UTC,"There are some but to be frank it isn't the Church of England! They are in a very sad state at the moment, and its going to get worse.  However, my denomination has its issues. The Baptist Union of Great Britain was formed when the General Baptists and Particular Baptists (the type that I am which believes in the doctrines of sovereign grace) came together in 1891, although its roots go back further.  There were issues with the Baptists before the union. C. H Spurgeon (known as the 'Prince of Preachers' who preached to an estimated 10,000,000 people in his life) alleged that an incremental creeping of the Graf-Wellhausen hypothesis, Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, and other concepts was weakening the Baptist Union.  I think that all denominations in the west are being infected by the theology of 'liberal Christianity'. Sadly, a lot of churches are following the world instead of the Word. The CoE is the best example of this as they now have female bishops and vicars, and have recently removed the word ""devil"" from their baptism liturgy. The archbishop's of Canterbury (highest position bar our queen) aren't helping either as the current one thinks that same sex marriage is ""great"", and the previous one became a druid! Same sex marriage has been legalised and because the CoE is a state church headed by the queen it had to. But I believe that the CoE has been following unbiblical practices always as they are the middle ground between Protestantism and Romanism."

Christians,382ikh,pubmadison,2,Mon Jun 1 23:54:18 2015 UTC,"Thank you brother. But why do you mention Timothy? Was he young?   Do have have access to theological resources   I use a free Bible study program called e-Sword on my PC and MySword on my mobile which are both very good because you can get lots of different commentaries, concordances, maps, books, etc. My favourite commentators are John Gill and Albert Barnes because they are so exhaustive and rich.  I watch videos from brothers on youtube. One channel that is brilliant is this one which has lots of hymns, sermons and audio books. I like to listen to their Puritan writers as I love how they quote scripture a lot to back up their words.  As well as youtube, I sometimes watch documentaries. I watched one recently called 'Tares Among the Wheat', and it talked about church history (different groups such as the Waldenses, Lollards, Hussites, etc who were slaughtered by Rome), doctrine, Oxford Movement, the text type controversy (this is one topic that I am interested in and from previous research I have concluded that the Alexandrian text is corrupted and the Majority text is more purer, and as a result I use the KJV).  I go on different websites as well like this subreddit, PuritanBoard and a new forum made by Dying_Daily (which I think it is okay to mention, haha).  But what I need to improve on is to read more books because apart from the Bible and internet I don't read enough."
Christians,382ikh,drjellyjoe,2,Tue Jun 2 17:04:18 2015 UTC,"Yep, Timothy was quite young but was praised very highly by Paul.

Christians,382ikh,pubmadison,3,Tue Jun 2 17:06:16 2015 UTC,It's an ivy league university in the United States that was a conservative Presbyterian school at one time.

Christians,382ikh,VeritasDomain,2,Tue Jun 2 20:09:18 2015 UTC,I just ordered that book 3 days ago. Do you find the book still quite relevant today or is it more historical?
Christians,382ikh,FT4M,3,Tue Jun 2 02:44:22 2015 UTC,"Metaphorically speaking, Machen was a prophet.   There are some issues discussing the United States that are actually much better than they were 100 years ago, in regards to the extent of our religious liberty. An example can be found in almost universal legality of home-schooling and conscience clauses now, which were more rare then.  Additionally, what we have seen in the falling away of the mainstream denominations of the last twenty years is the continuation or logical conclusion of what Machen wrote about. The PC(USA) was acting non-Biblically then just as they do now. The actions and stances now are further along, but the heart of rebellion and fear of man instead of God is the same.  Also, you'll be surprised likely because of the use of the word liberalism. It's about liberal theology, not social gospel stuff inherently. The American evangelical church is so ingrained with that word being used for something else that many are surprised when they read the book."
Christians,382ikh,VeritasDomain,2,Tue Jun 2 15:25:29 2015 UTC,"He sounds akin to AW Tozer, who I esteem highly. Although I'm not Presbyterian, their history holds my interest. Also, I've been reading about an individual by the name of Freidrich Schleiermacher (a man I have much disdain for), who seems to have been loosely a source of much of today's liberalism in regards to the church. Even if he's not mentioned, I'm curious to know if some of his ideas prevailed in the PC(USA) and, based on what you've stated, this book may have an answer."

I think the commentator of this piece is spot-on in his assessment, albeit a bit wordy. Reference material can often inhibit our effort to know the Scriptures because they serve as ""cheats"" that the reader may not always be afforded. Part of knowing the Scriptures intimately is discovering and remembering how the writings interact with each other for yourself, and one of the best ways to do this is to eliminate the possibility to merely look to the margins in an attempt to avoid the heavy lifting that interpretation and exegesis often requires."

Christians,37tlwi,Mostlikelyme,3,Sat May 30 11:01:50 2015 UTC,"I disagree that gender dysphoria is real, most studies that attempt to track brain differences between those diagnosed with gender dysphoria and non-trans members of their own gender test people who have started undergoing hormone therapy. Plus saying that anything in Psychology exists in an objective, empirical sense doesn't really fly with the rest of science. It's like saying Economics is a real science, or Anthropology.  But the other categories, the ones with a biological basis, are completely real. The author of this article seems to be saying that we should exclude all those people, and not make any sort allowances for them, just because Jesus talked about male and female in regards to marriage.   Jesus mentions those made eunuchs by nature, so obviously intersex, hermaphrodites, and XXY aren't new things. Now we operate on most of them at birth, and assign them into a gender, when in reality they aren't that gender, or the other one. And then we require them to play the gender role assigned to them at birth. That's pretty messed up. There should be allowances. Maybe this law goes to far, but Christians need to have a little grace"

Christians,37tt8c,TurlessTiger,2,Sat May 30 21:17:01 2015 UTC,"I will preface my reply (which may turn out to be long winded) with this: This is all in my very humble opinion.  When it comes to science, as the article pointed out, we must not dismiss any possibility. To do so would be to forsake science. However, I hold the probability of Young Earth Creationism to be very low. As we have advanced through time, we have found many things to be highly improbable. For example, it was once though that the Earth was the center of our universe. To deny this was even considered blasphemy. Through scientific discovery, we have found this to be false. We have alarming evidence (including first hand observation) that the Earth in fact revolves around the Sun, which revolves around the center of the galaxy we inhabit. To ignore the alarming evidence against a 6,000 year old Earth is (again, IMHO) ignorant. Nowhere in the Bible does our Father tell us exactly when he created us, or exactly how long it took in human terms. He is an eternal being, outside of our own space time. One day for Yahweh could be what seems like an eternity for us. The vastness and grandness of our universe is a testament to his omnipotence. To presume to know exactly how he did this and exactly how long it took him is hubris. He has given us many gifts, and the joy of discovery is a gift I hold dear.   Macro-evolution is a possibility, just as Young Earth Creationism is a possibility. I simply hold them at different levels of probability. The Bible was inspired by Yahweh's words, but still written down by the hands of fallible men."
Christians,37tt8c,TurlessTiger,1 point,Sat May 30 21:42:51 2015 UTC,"Thank you.  So are you saying that grocentrism need not be discussed, because it has been proven to be false?

Psalm 11:5 - The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.  Psalm 53:5 There were they in great fear, where no fear was: for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee: thou hast put them to shame, because God hath despised them.  Psalm 73:20 As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image.  Psalm 78:59 When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:  Psalm 106:40 Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.  Proverbs 6:16-19 These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him: A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief, A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.  Proverbs 22:14 The mouth of strange women is a deep pit: he that is abhorred of the LORD shall fall therein.  Lamentations 2:6 And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were of a garden: he hath destroyed his places of the assembly: the LORD hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion, and hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest.  Hosea 9:15 All their wickedness is in Gilgal: for there I hated them: for the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine house, I will love them no more: all their princes are revolters.  Zechariah 11:8 Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul lothed them, and their soul also abhorred me.  Malachi 1:3 And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness.  Romans 9:13 As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.     Thanks for sharing this by the way. Please may you post it on /r/ChristianVideo?

Christians,37pc4y,drjellyjoe,1 point,Fri May 29 15:17:57 2015 UTC,I used to agree with Morey's way of thinking. Now I believe it underestimates God's goodness. One practical result of holding Morey's view is a lack of assurance of salvation.
Christians,37pc4y,Godisandalliswell,1 point,Sat May 30 00:07:12 2015 UTC,"The question that we should be asking is ""what does the scripture say?"", and not to involve our emotions feelings which do not determine the nature of God."
Christians,37pc4y,drjellyjoe,2,Sat May 30 10:48:13 2015 UTC,"But having asked the question, ""What does the Scripture say,"" we should then accept what it does say. To use Morey's example, the holy Scriptures say that ""God so loved the world."" Upon those clear, glorious words Morey lifted up his tool and added his own words, saying, ""world of believers,"" because the Scripture as it stands does not fit Morey's own preconceived theory of what it should say. This was not exegesis but eisegesis."
Christians,37pc4y,Godisandalliswell,1 point,Sat May 30 12:59:43 2015 UTC,"Before I respond to your question of John 3:16, I want to point out that there are many verses that speak of God hating/abhorring/despising people, and we must not ignore these verses.  When you read ""world"" or ""all"" you should not think that it ALWAYS means every single person, all the time, everywhere. If you do then that causes problems with certain verses such as 1 John 5:19. If we plug that ""everyone, everytime, everywhere"" meaning into that verse it would mean that even us Christians lie in wickedness and are under the control of Satan. Or how about Rev 13:3, which mean that every person, everywhere followed the beast. So we shouldn't be ignoring the fact that it requires context, the fact that in the original Greek it had different meanings, and say ""it is obvious what it means! whole world! everyone!"".  Same goes with the word ""world"", it means ""the universe"" in Acts 17:24, the Earth in John 13:1, the world system in Matthew 4:8, the whole human race in romans 3:19, humanity minus believers in John 15:18, gentiles only in Romans 11:12, and it means believers only in John 1:29, 3:16, 6:33, 1 John 2:2  C.H. Spurgeon:...""the whole world has gone after him"" Did all the world go after Christ? ""then went all Judea, and were baptized of him in Jordan."" Was all Judea, or all Jerusalem, baptized in Jordan? ""Ye are of God, little children"", and the whole world lieth in the wicked one"". Does the whole world there mean everybody? The words ""world"" and ""all"" are used in some seven or eight senses in Scripture, and it is very rarely the ""all"" means all persons, taken individually. The words are generally used to signify that Christ has redeemed some of all sorts-- some Jews, some Gentiles, some rich, some poor, and has not restricted His redemption to either Jew or Gentile ...   Also, the Greek expert Thayer included John 3:16 in this definition of kosmos: 8b) of believers only, John 1:29; 3:16; 3:17; 6:33; 12:47 1 Cor. 4:9; 2 Cor. 5:19."
Christians,37pc4y,drjellyjoe,2,Sat May 30 13:34:42 2015 UTC,"Since God is love, even the verses about God's ""hating/abhorring/despising"" His enemies should be seen in the light of His love. He who commands that we love even our abhorrent enemies does no less Himself.  Taking into consideration the context in which a word is found is one thing; reading into the text a preconceived notion is another. Neither the text of John 3:16 nor its context demand the invention of a ""world of believers."" That concept is demanded only by the desire to make the text agree with Calvinism. I know because I used to do that myself when I was a convinced Calvinist. I know all the tricks, brother.  If we let John 3:16 speak for itself, the sense is plain enough, plain that ""world"" refers to everyone. Everyone is invited to believe the good news of God's love. This broad sense of the word ""world"" also agrees with how John used the word ""world"" previously, in chapter 1. As a practical matter, if God did not so love everyone in the world, then there is no way to know for sure whether God so loved you or me."

Christians,37pc4y,drjellyjoe,2,Sun May 31 22:12:14 2015 UTC,"A magnificent question. It means finding sinners so disgusting that one cannot but do whatever is necessary to deliver them out of their vile estate. It means to pray concerning the hands that shed innocent Blood (Prov. 6:16,17), ""Father, forgive them."""
Christians,37pc4y,Godisandalliswell,1 point,Sun May 31 23:07:22 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, and nice use of scripture.  But what do you make of the verses that speak of David's perfect hatred for those who hate God (Psalm 139:19-24)? What about the imprecatory prayers that were prayed by David to God's enemies (and not David's enemies)?  I of course am not saying that we shouldn't pray for our enemies, and love them (which is not an affectionate or romantic love of course but involves what Jesus said about praying for them). But how shall we see the words by a man that God called ""a man after my own heart""?  It seems to me that the verses that I quoted in the previous posts show that God does not love everyone and equally (God loved Jacob but hated Esau)."
Christians,37od7z,matt52490,1 point,Fri May 29 03:07:56 2015 UTC,"The message here is overall a good one. I just have two comments. Firstly, I've always heard my pastors mentioning the spiritual death involved in the Fall, so I don't really relate to what the writer says about physical death being the one that is focused on too much. I'm sure that has happened in some places, just not in my experience.  The other thing is the implication that men are ""guiltier"" than women in the destruction of marital relationships. It takes two to tango, as they say, and while I believe that men are burdened with the task of giving their lives for God and their families as the writer says, I'm not sure we're doing marriage any favors by trying to figure out who has what proportion of the blame. Many men are not being all that God has called them to be, and it is the same for many women. Both should probably be acknowledged."

We therefore definitely have Biblical precedence to grieve that our culture is hardening itself to Christ and the repentance he commands from it.  On the other, we should also emphasize that this is merely a fulfillment of what Jesus said: ""If you love me, you will keep my commandments"" (John 14:15). Those who belong to Christ live lifestyles that are marked by true repentance and faith, and therefore being a Christian is much more than a mere cultural identifier marked by mental assent to certain principles."

California (where I'm from) saw a huge dropping out of the bottom half of the age brackets of interest (largely due to kids rejecting their parent's faith, etc.) - it wasn't a ""social obligation"" to remain Christian (it's historically been a bit more of a minority there than most of the South/Midwest), but we took a huge hit regardless.

My great grandfather was really an 'atheist' (he waved off all religious anything as baloney) and he also attended church every Sunday and every funeral or wedding or mass and would most definitely write 'Lutheran' on any paper or survey like it was his last name.   Having said that and agreeing in some sense its 'good' that people are being more accurate and honest about what's really been the same situation for decades - I'm more than a little concerned anyone is happy about this.   Christians are losing and getting weaker and wimpier and slacking and even worse some (even here) sound like they are HAPPY to learn less and less people will be among us so that they can be what.. unique.. and that hopefully its the end of the world?

If we say ""we're against gay marriage"", we've already closed the conversation and are failing at telling people about the gospel (in my opinion).  We let gossips and alcoholics come in and get comfortable in church.  We share the gospel with them and don't say ""alcohol should be illegal"" or ""gossips shouldn't be allowed to talk in church.""  We welcome them with open arms and teach them the word of God and hope they grow.  Then we hope the Holy Spirit enters them, convicts them of any wrongdoings in their life, and they correct it with the help of the church.  The main problem with all of this, is you have to get them to step inside the church.  If we tell people a central aspect of their life is wrong, they'll just harden their hearts towards us and God.  I feel like most christians are closing more doors than they're opening.  If we let a door stay open, then maybe someone will enter, meet Jesus, and then strive for a higher moral calling.  If they don't have Jesus in their life, then there probably won't be any change.  Although I'm guessing you were posting about indifference towards the lives of others.  Which then I agree mostly with your comments.  But it's not our job to change people, that's the job of the Holy Spirit.  Our job is to go out and spread God Love."

If you tell someone ""stop being gay"", but they don't know Christ, then you're not going to get anywhere.  The message repeated throughout the Bible is one of ""We messed up, but God loved us so much that all we have to do is believe in him and accept his grace.""  I don't think the steps are:   Stop sinning Come to know Jesus   I think it's more of:   Come to know Jesus Work on stepping closer to God and removing sin from your life   I think if you're telling someone to stop being gay, they should already be a brother in Christ.  You can't expect people to change or repent for something they don't believe in.  There are many people who pick and choose a religion based on what fits their lifestyle.

But don't we have to demonstrate to people that they are in fact sinners before they will have any reason to listen to the gospel?  If Christ died for the ungodly, that only matters if I'm ungodly.  So don't we need to start with showing them their need for the Savior?"
Christians,37j9dw,16km,1 point,Fri May 29 20:12:30 2015 UTC,"That's actually where I'm struggling now in trying to share my faith and win others.  I have some friends who have suffered a lot of ""hate speech"" and are turned off to religion, but they know I believe in Jesus and respect my beliefs.  Every once in a while they're open to conversation, but there's some triggers that will shut the conversation down.  Right now I'm hoping that showing kindness and keeping open invitations will open the door to more conversation and hopefully them finding faith, hope and trust in God.  But I don't think you need to point out specific areas of ungodliness in their lives.  There's a big difference between making someone acknowledge they are a sinner and calling them out on sin.  You could use generalizations, like everyone's lied or experienced jealousy, and even that makes us fall short of God's glory.  Even if we believe in Jesus, we will probably experience jealousy and etc again, but we need to acknowledge it's wrong and try our best not to do it again.  For things more specific, I would pray for the Holy Spirit to convict them, but I'm a bit idealistic when it comes to a lot of things.  Like I said, this is an area that I'm bad at, so I'm open to ideas.  For a lot of people following God and saying homosexuality is a sin means a life of being alone, or constantly feeling bad about feeling attracted to someone.  They know there will be fellowship, and there will be people supporting them on a walk with Christ, but they want a physical partner to walk though life with them, and I'm not sure how to help them through that aspect.  I would hope that God's love through people and the church would satisfy their desires for companionship enough, and that if they just made the leap of faith it would happen.  I don't know anyone personally who's testimony covers homosexuality as a sin.  I know a lot of gay Christians who don't feel convicted to change.  A lot of people I do know who aren't believers feel like they'd have to change if they did believe.  I'm just hoping God will give me the words to plant and water the seed.  I do feel like my approach lacks fire...  Edit: I do feel like my responses are long.  Thank you for taking the time to read them.  I hope my responses aren't coming off a hostile.  I feel like making disciples is harder in this day and age when the world has so many reasons to not need God, with people shouting ""turn or burn"" being one of them.  There are also a ton of examples of faithless people doing good works for the poor and hungry.  People are so comfortable in sin, they don't want to change, and a lot of Christians scare people away.  At the same time, I don't want that to make me hesitant in sharing the Gospel."

Because if they are to become saved then their lifestyle has to change. Another thing is if gay marriage becomes legal. If a gay married man becomes a Christian, he is now entangled in a mess of legal issues, especially if the couple adopted. If gay marriage remains illegal (on a federal level) then that won't be an issue. But that's an issue of differing levels of importance to people.

I'll tell you exactly what you should think lol   OK, go ahead.  I'm currently Scoutmaster of a troop with around 30 active boys, including my own sons.  I have a meeting almost every week, and a campout approximately once a month, in which I'm able to be some kind of a positive influence (I hope!) in their lives.  I could tell you a few stories about my Scouts' home lives which, at least, almost make me cry.    I conduct a brief worship service on most campouts.  We do various kinds of community service regularly.  In general, it's a pretty good peer group.  On top of that, we get to do some pretty fun ""outdoorsy"" things.  And I enjoy the adult company too.  And yet, it's not deliberately Christian, and rapidly becoming less so.

Christians,37hlkh,Tolle-Lege,1 point,Wed May 27 20:44:40 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you mean by ""evolutionists"" and ""random."" Most academic and professional biologists are only concerned with the biological mechanism and thus do their best to refrain from making philosophical or metaphysical statements. That doesn't necessarily inhibit naturalists and committed philosophical materialists, however, from doing so, and since there's no prohibition from one being a Christian biologist any more than there a prohibition against one being a committed atheist biologist (however paradoxical or absurd we may argue that is), many biologists may see it not only appropriate but necessary to incorporate their own worldview into their academic work. Additionally, many people in the sciences see philosophical materialism as something that they have to affirm in order to legitimize their field without incorporating what they consider ""ideological"" or ""religious"" biases since inherent secularism is often approached as being a position that is essentially neutral. The hard part in recent decades has been, instead, showing people that philosophical naturalism/materialism is in and of itself an ideological/religious commitment, as many in the West - especially Millennials - have swallowed the New Atheist polemic that it's the default worldview of ""rational people"" or ""intellectuals"" hook line and sinker."

If Josh Duggar repented, then he was most assuredly forgiven. God can (and does) forgive any sin. The sin of Josh Duggar was no more heinous in God's eyes than any sin I've ever committed. I have no hatred for Josh Duggar, I don't wish to see him physically injured, called cruel names or threatened. I don't hate anybody who has done the things he did. In fact, I worked with sex offenders as they tried to re-enter society after mental health treatment or incarceration. I actively sought to help these men and women who had done things that would make most people ill.

Surely we don't still accord Paul a mass murderer, do we? Or John Newton a slave-owner?  George Muller a thief? The power of regeneration is a mighty thing, and in this case, that someone who was once a child molester, which the world deems unchangable, has a clean record in the decade since his salvation is a tremendous testimony.  A tremendous testimony that the media cannot understand, because they don't believe in the power of God.  But we do!

Based on what you have said, you seem to be struggling with conflicting desires to serve and follow Christ or serve and follow the world and your own desires. Christ is very clear about the cost to follow Him,   And calling the crowd to him with his disciples, he said to them, “If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel's will save it. For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul? For what can a man give in return for his soul? For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him will the Son of Man also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.” (Mark 8:34-38 ESV)   It's your decision. No one can coerce you into rejecting earthly pleasures and following Christ with your whole heart. Rest assured that there is no in-between. You cannot have both. You can either serve Christ or not. You cannot serve both God and yourself. The consequence of following Christ is eternal life. The consequence of following the world and self is eternal punishment."

Good works come as a result of hearing and believing God's Word which is present verbally and in the sacraments.   I was constantly taught if you do this you're going to hell, or if you do this immoral thing you're going to hell and I was kinda tired of hearing it   There are entire books in the Bible of things you should not do or you will go to Hell. Those are, for example, Leviticus and Deuteronomy. People have been trying to follow laws like these since the dawn of time. It's not possible. People are telling you ""just don't do those things, be good,"" but it won't ever work. (It sounds like people are directing you to the Law instead of the Gospel.) You can't be good enough on your own. No one seeks for God. Everyone loves their sin more than holiness. Even you say that you can't give up your sin without losing your identity. You choose your ""identity"" over God. And no one else is any different.   Read this: Romans 3:9-18  This is the state that Jesus came to redeem us from. No one wanted him, but he came anyway. We all like sheep have gone astray, and the Lord laid on him the iniquity of us all. Read this: Isaiah 53. He loved you enough to die for you, and there is no more death for those who trust in him. Death has lost its sting. This is a trustworthy saying.  That's it. He made an end of it. For free. He did it for you. He paid the price for your transgressions, and he set you free from the Law.

The wages of sin is death, not fire and brimstone.  Eternal death is the everlasting punishment.   In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus refers to geena three times. He warned the Pharisees of the damnation of geena. The nature and effect of the fire is described in the Bible as ""unquenchable fire"" (Mark 9:43-48; Luke 3:9) or ""everlasting fire"" (Matthew 25:41). This fire will cleanse the earth (2 Peter 3:10-12; Luke 3:17) after the second resurrection (Revelation 20:5). The word aiónios, which means ""everlasting,"" is used to describe the fate of the righteous as well as the wicked. The punishment of the wicked is everlasting death. The fire itself is not everlasting, but the final consequence of the fire—death—is everlasting. This principle is clearly demonstrated in the Scriptures. In Malachi 4:1-3, speaking of that last day when the earth and all the wicked are burned up, God tells the prophet, ""behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch... they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this."" Ashes and stubble indicate that the fire is out. The wicked do not burn eternally, but their destruction is final. Their pain and suffering is over, as is their life of sin and rebellion. God has mercy even on the wicked in that He does not allow them to suffer eternally. Similarly, Jude 7 says, ""Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth as an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire"" (emphasis added). The fires are no longer burning, but the consequences of the fires are everlasting. SOURCE"
Christians,37b5cx,SquareHimself,2,Tue May 26 11:41:10 2015 UTC,"The fire itself is not everlasting, but the final consequence of the fire—death—is everlasting.   Scripture does not teach this.   In Malachi 4:1-3, speaking of that last day when the earth and all the wicked are burned up   This is referring to this world, not the world to come. Other Scripture (Daniel) says they will then rise to everlasting punishment. Again, the burning up refers to this world, not the world to come.  Your usage of Jude 7 is a stretch.  A good summary here."
Christians,37b5cx,Dying_Daily,-2,Tue May 26 13:34:13 2015 UTC,"Scripture does not teach this.   Show me some scripture to support your position.   Other Scripture (Daniel) says they will then rise to everlasting punishment.   It's the same story. Everlasting death is everlasting punishment. Death is the punishment for sin. The wages of sin is death! There is no arguing that point. Since when is the wages of sin everlasting life? The doctrine of eternal torture is contradictory in every way to the character of God revealed in the scriptures.  The second coming coincides with the first resurrection of the righteous. The second resurrection, also called the second death, is when hellfire devours sin once and for all.  EDIT: The summary you linked to agrees with my position, not yours:   The doctrine of eternal death is not a popular doctrine to teach or proclaim. To do so often opens one up to scorn and ridicule. However, we must not let that detract us from what the Bible so clearly teaches; namely, that due to our being born in sin and trespasses, we are under the just condemnation of God for our sin. If we do not embrace the saving message of Jesus Christ, we will perish in our sin and trespasses and be under God’s just judgment for our sin—eternal death. This is a sobering doctrine and requires the utmost care and compassion in its presentation."

Note too (particularly in the Daniel and Matthew passages) that the same adjective (“everlasting” or “eternal”) is used to modify both “life” and “punishment/contempt.” What is true about one (life) must be true about the other (punishment), that both are eternal and last forever."
Christians,37b5cx,SquareHimself,1 point,Tue May 26 15:31:48 2015 UTC,"The page you just linked to says explicitly:   The most important question to be answered is “Does the Bible teach the doctrine of eternal death?” If the Bible doesn’t teach eternal death, then we can pack up and go home because there is no further debate on the issue. God’s Word, the Bible, is the infallible rule of faith and practice, and as such we must believe and teach only what it clearly teaches, and the Bible clearly teaches the doctrine of eternal death."

I think it's completely incompatible with Hebrews 11:   These all died in faith, not having received the things promised, but having seen them and greeted them from afar, and having acknowledged that they were strangers and exiles on the earth. For people who speak thus make it clear that they are seeking a homeland. If they had been thinking of that land from which they had gone out, they would have had opportunity to return. But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared for them a city.  (Hebrews 11:13-16 ESV)   I don't know what Christians the author is talking about who think it's okay to be ""proud"" of your city or your family name or whatever, but those things are idolatry, too.  Our cities are wicked and our families are wicked and our country is wicked, because without God, there is only wickedness.  We cannot be proud of wickedness.  If we are proud of our countries, have ""allegiance"" to our countries, as the article says, then, in what way are we even remotely ""strangers and exiles"" who aren't ""thinking of that land from which we have gone out"" but are ""seeking a homeland""?"

Without a good grasp of what the Universal Moral Law actually is, my first instinct is to think that it could be explained as coming from a physiological/ genetic predisposition. Some thing like how certain breeds of dogs are bred specifically for certain behaviors. Although since I think the way biology works points to a Creator, I would get to the same conclusion in a slightly different way.   I like your reply to 3.

Denial of self and submission to Christ is the hallmark of every Christian, and homosexuality is no different. We all have flesh that desires to separate itself from Christ and indulge in sin.

Are they not called to that same vow of celibacy?  in other words, God has yet to bring them together with a partner that allows them to glorify God.  Maybe he will, maybe he won't. God is the one that puts love in our  hearts, etc.  Besides, research suggests that its possible, if not probable for a primarily gay woman to fall in love with a man.. if its the right man.   see Rosario Butterfield, for an example of this. Or Pastor Sean Harrison as an example of a homosexual man who is still gay, but fell in love with a woman, as well.. who he married and has kids with.  If God chooses to bring a man in to this woman's life, and that is what he wants to do for his glory, you can be sure she would fall in love with that man."

One of the incorrect narratives in the media is that sexual orientation doesn't change. For heterosexual adults, this is largely true. The research shows that heterosexuality is very rigid over time. (I can link you to research papers if you're interested in this )  With regard to those identifying as LBG, however (sexual minorities) this is not the case. Many LBG folks once felt (or believed they felt) attraction to the opposite sex. Many are ""bi"" and some started off believing they were homosexual, but then found an opposite sex mate.

Is that an absolute horror to suggest?   In studying research in this matter, the reality is I believe that the brain chemistry surrounding sexual orientation is actually fairly well known. We could probably offer a ""cure"" for homosexuality, through a combination of behavioral and hormonal treatments. For example, researchers have turned heterosexual rats ""gay"" (but only attracted to one other same sex partner) using this type of technique,.I actually posted about this in the /r/science thread  http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/33hsm9/heterosexual_male_rats_develop_samesex_sexual/  (see also  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3960032/)  anyway, the problem is society. Society has already banned gay conversion therapy ( which is nothing more than TALK for the most part). We say we have ""free speech"" but try taking your kid to talk to someone who is a gay conversion therapist. You'll be arrested.  Anyway, society is warped on this issue. Take the issue of transexuality. Instead of trying to come up with ways to treat the brain disconnect through hormones, drugs, etc... what our society has decided is that its better to try to treat the BODY to match it up with the flawed brain... .So we do radical surgery on genitals and pump them full of hormones in order to change physiology, all the while denying the UNDERLYING FACT that their genetics say they are the opposite sex! For example, you have a guy thats XY genetics and he believes he's a woman. We try to change his body in to a woman's body, even though genetically that's impossible, instead of trying to fix his brain so that it is in union with the body and the genes. (BTW, there are people that believe they are animals in a human body, as well.. Not sure when we're going to start trying to transform their bodies in to animal bodies, but you can bet it will happen eventually)  Scientists can already switch the sexual orientation of fruit flies  http://tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/12/11/turning-homosexuality-on-and-off/?_r=0  it is my opinion that research in this area, with regards to human beings, would never be funded in today's climate.  Bottom line: It is my opinion science could offer a ""cure"" for homosexuality to those that wanted it, within a decade or less, but that won't happen.  The wickedness of society, however, will not allow that to happen. Like sodom (and like Paul's references in Romans 1) our society is no longer interested in male/female sex but now has a lust for all things homosexual. If anything, we will use our increase in science and knowledge to offer the ""gay lifestyle"" alternative to heterosexuals who wish to be gay  EDIT, forget to mention that research is being done in to prenatal steps that can be used to prevent homosexuality.  Of course there's a movement to stop that sort of research as well  https://www.change.org/p/homosexual-cure-please-help-stop-cah-study-engineering-for-sexual-orientation"

I do disagree with ""the worst of the rooms (whichever that maybe) is, I think, preferable"".

Christians,361poz,Eagle9183,3,Fri May 15 10:42:00 2015 UTC,"That's an intriguing analogy to think through.  I like it and will probably use it in the future, but the theology is off.  It presupposes that God's love and fairness are dependent upon sins being against other people.  But this is not the case.  God's love and justice ultimately must apply as in a context against God alone.  So, the analogy should be about the little girl pushing her mom and the mom saying, ""I'm not going to do anything about it.""  Now, ask the girl: ""Was it loving for me not punish you for hurting me?""  The little girl will certainly say, ""Yes, of course it was!""  But this is a misunderstanding.  It presupposes that the little girl is more important than the mom's rules and her concept fairness.  Indeed, the mother is essentially telling the little girl, ""I might not impose any consequences if you disrespect me.""  This is a terrible life lesson and not loving at all.  Additionally, it degrades the value of the mother in her role as an authority over the little girl and the importance of the rules.  Now, if the little girl apologized to her mom and the mom decided to forgive her without punishment, that's a different story.  Now we have a girl who respects the rules, understands that what she did was wrong, and is trusting in her mother to provide a means of absolution of that wrongdoing.  By forgiving her with no punishment, the Mother is reinforcing the concept of repentance, which is a great and loving life-lesson and further exemplifies the mother's authority over the child.  Both love and justice are satisfied in the theologically appropriate context."
Christians,361poz,ruizbujc,1 point,Fri May 15 16:49:23 2015 UTC,"That means every person chooses whether they go to heaven with God or if they are separated from God forever in hell.

Ephesians 1:4-5: Even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him. In love he predestined us for adoption as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will.  Romans 8:28-30: And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose. For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified.  John 6:44: No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him. And I will raise him up on the last day.  John 15:16: You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you.

Christians,361poz,TheRealCestus,1 point,Sat May 16 15:43:56 2015 UTC,"Two fundamental truths working together helped me see God's love and God's wrath as being totally cohesive, for lack of a better word.   ""God is love"" and ""His name is Jealous"".   Note that ""God is love"" is almost a difficult sentence for us grammatically (that is, ""love"" is noun when we would otherwise expect an adjective in that sentence. But when you view that in relation to His other attributes, it totally makes sense. His name is Jealous. This is fundamentally true because He owns everything - everything that exists, exists by His express will, and, fundamentally so, He has a stake in it.   Also no other attribute of God is mentioned in the same context as ""God is love"". To me, rhetorically, I take that as it being fundamental to all of His other attributes.   All that is the backdrop for His love and His wrath being totally cohesive. In fact, I believe His wrath isn't merely CONSISTENT with His love, but rather that it EMANATES FROM His love.   In Romans 1:18, the sinner suppresses the truth of God in unrighteousness. It is at THIS point that God GIVES US OVER to sin, as an expression of His wrath, as the text indicates right there, that His wrath is REVEALED through this BECAUSE we suppressed the truth about Him in unrighteousness. This is the same God who created everything and is, again, whose name is Jealous, and that God is love. He has a stake in all of this, and it means something to Him. It means something to Him when a person turns from Him Romans 1:18 style, as we all have done.   There was an unbeliever who I only vaguely knew, but I did hear later died in a car accident, a rather nasty one which involved the presence of alcohol and other factors which would certainly indicate he probably died in a state of not knowing Christ. Although I didn't know him very well, I dwelled on this for probably an entire afternoon, thinking about the corner of the road where his car swerved off, and how this was one of the last things he saw before hell. I wondered what he might of thought the first second he realized he was now in hell - what does one begin to think as they come to terms with the fact that hell is where God wants them? It is the ultimate rejection of a person.   While dwelling on this it dawned on me - although this person had almost certainly forgotten about God early in his life, GOD NEVER FORGOT ABOUT HIM. His life MATTERED to God. I am changing the name here, to Jason, from something else.... but I realized then JASON'S LIFE MATTERED TO GOD, and Jason mattered to God.   Although Jason turned from God in Romans 1:18 fashion, and forgot God, God never forgot about it.   Many people come and go in our lives but I have come to realize that one of the messages of hell is that this is NOT the case with God. He doesn't just take you or leave you. You ARE His whether you want Him or not. And if you turn and reject Him, His love for you will TURN INTO WRATH.   This is my belief from scripture. He does not love some and have wrath towards others. Rather, He loves all, and for those who reject Him, that love TURNS TO WRATH and that is all that is left for them to have of God, but eventually they will have to face up to their decision to reject Him, and that will take place in hell and on judgement day.   My belief is that you could say that His love FUELS His wrath but I feel it is even more fundamental than that. It emanates from His wrath, His love becomes wrath, just as Jesus turned water into wine so it was no longer water but something else, so too, for the unbeliever His love has turned to wrath and wrath is what that now is for them.   In short, hell is an expression of God's love.   And if you think about it a lot, it is actually a profound expression of love."

Adam and Eve didn't have a white wedding, or a Catholic or Anglican ceremony. Sex is serious but sex is also natural. If people realised it meant marriage, they'd want to honour their relationships and stay with that person. Some people consider themselves married but haven't had a chance for a ceremony. Not everyone just wants to have sex, or is even considering leaving their partner. Also, unfortunately some people make the mistake of sleeping with each other too early - and I don't think we should be encouraging them to divorce."

Christians,35ex26,DreamProfit,1 point,Tue May 12 04:02:46 2015 UTC,"The Bible does not say sex is marriage. Adam and Eve were married. God presents Eve to Adam (We here an officiant say, Who gives this man to be married to this woman?)  Adam pronounces his commitment to her saying what he could not say of the rest of Creation - that she is flesh of his flesh. God seals it in ponouncing that this is what marriage is to be (Man leaving father and mother, cleaving to his wife (this is more than living together and having sex btw), and becoming one flesh.  Btw, becoming one flesh is an explicit reference to conceiving a child. And while you don't have to conceive a child to be married, it should be noted that most cohabitating couples are taking steps to explicitly prevent that reality.   Back to the point, though, the problem with cohabitating couples is that the are having sex outside of the committing and cleaving together that God commands.   As a side note, I don't think we should pass lightly of the Old Testament's expectation that a woman should be a virgin until she consumates the marriage on her wedding night."
Christians,35ex26,DreamProfit,1 point,Sun May 10 19:42:00 2015 UTC,"Adam and Eve became one flesh - that is marriage.   One flesh does not mean 'concieving a child,' it refers to the physical union and spiritual binding of two lovers.  The adulterer that Jesus speaks to in the Bible is divorced and married several times. I don't think anyone assumes she 'married' each and every partner.  We always have the officiant, God, with us.   Cohabiting couples aren't always non-committal.  To consummate means to fulfill. The act of sex makes a marriage real.   Of course, I'm not saying people should sleep around. I'm saying that our choices matter - if you choose to have sex you are married and you need to be committed thus. That's the spiritual reality.  Telling two lovers who've been together and faithful for a considerable period of time and are living together hopefully with the intention of having a proper wedding to break up is encouraging divorce. If they have said their vows before God and they understand the contract between them they must not divorce on a whim. The Bible even prescribes obligations to men who have slept with woman and denied them their proper rights as a wife - that's because that's what they made them."

He is not sinning. They should get married. ""  what does that mean? How could you ""not be acting honorably"" toward a virgin?  also in verse 9, we read ""Now to the unmarried and the widows I say: It is good for them to stay unmarried, as I do. 9But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion.""  what does that mean, it is better to marry than to burn with passion?  and finally, when Jesus talks about looking on a woman with lust, is that ok, if she's unmarried (since it couldn't be adultery)?

He cometh with ten thousands of His Saints To execute judgment upon all, And to destroy all the ungodly: And to convict all flesh Of all the works of their ungodliness which they have ungodly committed, And of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him.   Deut 33:2 says:   The Lord came from Sinai and dawned from Seir upon us; he shone forth from Mount Paran; he came from the ten thousands of Saints, with flaming fire at his right hand.   They're similar in a number of ways there, but there are some other reasons that I can't completely recall at the moment. The wikipedia has some sources that might be helpful. I can't remember where I read that, but it was convincing to me.   Also, since Jude says it was genuine prophecy, you think it was lost between the time of Jude and now, and--you think Scripture can be lost?   There's a couple of possibilities.    It's possible that Jude was somehow mistaken that the prophecy of Enoch that he had was not written by Enoch, but a pseudepigrapha. I find that unlikely because I think the Holy Spirit would've directed him otherwise. More likely, I think Jude did have a piece of the original Enoch or at least an oral tradition regarding it. Someone took that same oral tradition and/or the piece of original Enoch and fabricated the entirety of the book. So while that section is fairly authentic, that doesn't mean the whole of it is. For it to be believed, there has to be enough truth for people to it accept it as true. It helps when you actually have a quote of the original.   But I hold all of this loosely.

Oh, gotcha. A midrash is basically a Jewish commentary on scripture. It's possible that this quote from Enoch came first and Deuteronomy copied it, but in the vast majority of cases, the one that comes after is expansive, not condensing. Enoch has much more elements and text around it than does Deut 33. It would be unusual for Deut 33 to be a copy of Enoch 1:9 and yet have less text.   Okay, I'm tracking with you here. But that means we have to be okay with the reality that there is actual Scripture that we do not have, that is lost   Well I guess it depends on your definition of scripture. If what Enoch wrote was true and accurate, does that make it scripture? If it was prophecy, does that make it scripture? My answer is 'no'. Only scripture is scripture. There have been many authoritative words and prophecies that are not in scripture - because God didn't mean for us to have them 3000 years after.

I agree essentially with what you say regarding prophecy vs. scripture (although I suspect we would diverge somewhat because of the cessationist/continuationist thing :)), but, to me, the problem is that Jude clearly ""had"" it.  My understanding is that it was had by the Jews (if not regarded as canonical), and had by the early church, and lost thereafter.  As Wikipedia says, Barnabus, Clement, Irenaeus, and Tertullian all accepted it as canonical--and referenced its contents.  Which would lead one to think that they had the same version Jude had, and Jude says his was canonical (at the least, if he was quoting the ""one true"" part and the rest was a fabrication, you'd think he would have said so!).  Whether it's the same as the Book of Enoch preserved by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church is another question, but it seems like in the early church, they had an actual book, which Jude quoted and said was actually Enoch actually prophesying, and which they held as canonical.  Which book is either now lost, despite the attestation from Jude to its authenticity and the centuries of regarding it as Scripture, and millennia of preservation--or it's the book in the Ethiopian language now.

I can't think of anywhere else that NT authors quoted an actual book, said it was authentic and prophetic, and yet we don't regard it as canonical.  Nor, for that matter, can I think of an example where true prophecy was recorded, kept for thousands of years, and yet not regarded as Scripture.  I agree that there were many prophecies that were never written down, but the Book of Enoch was both written, preserved, through the Flood and millennia thereafter, and confirmed as authentic by NT writers.

I have larger theological issues with churches that even share the same branding as my own than I do with the Catholics now. Reformation in an organization this vast is painfully slow, and much of the process was hindered by wars across Europe over the centuries. I think the post-Vatican reforms Catholic Church is on an excellent track, and they are here to fight the same enemy we are.

Christians,34wjjt,frawaurhtamma,1 point,Wed May 6 00:11:45 2015 UTC,"I've been reading Romans.  I'm still a novice Christian (and tend to quote the lesson from a service more than I quote the Bible...), but Romans is quoted from a lot and I thought it would be good to read.  It's actually been pretty enlightening.  Some of it has helped me stop beating myself up over things, and part of it has helped give a more realistic view of what it means to live a Christian lifestyle.  I deal with some hard core atheists who study the bible and learn scripture to use it against believers.  We were talking about born again Christians.  Their claim was if someone was truly born again they wouldn't sin anymore.  My claim was it's just a constant struggle, and we strive not to, but are unable to because of our human desires.  They said Romans 6:2-3 is proof that there's no such thing as born again Christians and that the Bible sets foolish believers up for an impossible task  Romans 6:2-3 (HCSB)   2 Absolutely not! How can we who died to sin still live in it? 3 Or are you unaware that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death?   I said that is more about the choice to willingly sin and mentioned Paul even struggled with sin saying something about a thorn in his side.  I didn't have any quotes from scripture and felt bad (but it drove me to actually start opening my Bible :P ).  But they quoted 1 Corinthians 6:9-11.  They then brought up the question about Christians who have sex before marriage: aren't they committing adultery?  What about Christian spouses who cheat on each other?  Or a couple that doesn't cheat, but gets divorced, and they remarry (not each other)?  I said something like God will forgive those sins if they repent.  Christians should do their best to consult with God before they make decisions, and even with we mess up we're covered by Jesus' blood.  They then asked about should the couple that remarried repent every day, or after every time they have sex, and if they forget to repent do they go to Hell?  I said probably not, Jesus died for their sins.  Then the debate got kind of circular with them throwing out more scripture and me having only ideals I hoped were portrayed in the Bible but was starting to worry about.  1 Corinthians 6:9-11 (HCSB)   9 Don't you know that the unrighteous will not inherit God's kingdom? Do not be deceived: No sexually immoral people, idolaters, adulterers, or anyone practicing homosexuality, 10 no thieves, greedy people, drunkards, verbally abusive people, or swindlers will inherit God's kingdom. 11 And some of you used to be like this. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.""   So I felt really bad and wounded.  I also started to realize that I tend to say ideas that may or may not have scriptural backing to them.  I also remember going to Churches that would take verses out of context and manipulate them for their ideals (""Christ wants us to live a fulfilled life!  It's fine to want and prioritize getting a Ferrari.  If you're with disagrees with you, she should be submitting to you anyways, it's in the Bible!"").  But yeah...  I started beating myself up over the smallest things, and I beat myself up for not having the right verses in mind when questions came up.  Romans has both the beat you down feeling and the optimistic feeling to it.  It's nice to see where so many popular quotes are taken from, and it makes me thirst more for God's word.  One of the chapters that really stood out was chapter 7, particularly Romans 7:14-25  Romans 7:14-25 (HCSB)   14 For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am made out of flesh, sold into sin’s power. 15 For I do not understand what I am doing, because I do not practice what I want to do, but I do what I hate. 16 And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree with the law that it is good. 17 So now I am no longer the one doing it, but it is sin living in me. 18 For I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my flesh. For the desire to do what is good is with me, but there is no ability to do it. 19 For I do not do the good that I want to do, but I practice the evil that I do not want to do. 20 Now if I do what I do not want, I am no longer the one doing it, but it is the sin that lives in me. 21 So I discover this principle: When I want to do what is good, evil is with me. 22 For in my inner self I joyfully agree with God’s law. 23 But I see a different law in the parts of my body, waging war against the law of my mind and taking me prisoner to the law of sin in the parts of my body. 24 What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this dying body? 25 I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, with my mind I myself am a slave to the law of God, but with my flesh, to the law of sin.   I used to think attending Church and going to Bible Study was enough, but now I realize that was a lie I told myself.  Taking initiative to read scripture on my own has shown me a lot that I was missing out on or misinformed on.  It has also allowed me to recognize when people twist scripture.  At the same time it makes me worry that I might twist scripture, but that also encourages me to read it more.  ...what was the question again...?"

Regarding some of the bad things our government has done, yes there have been good and bad throughout the ages. However, not everything you hear on History channel is true either. -> America: Imagine the World Without Her  See also: The Law by Bastiat...   We hold from God the gift which includes all others. This gift is life — physical, intellectual, and moral life.  But life cannot maintain itself alone. The Creator of life has entrusted us with the responsibility of preserving, developing, and perfecting it. In order that we may accomplish this, He has provided us with a collection of marvelous faculties. And He has put us in the midst of a variety of natural resources. By the application of our faculties to these natural resources we convert them into products, and use them. This process is necessary in order that life may run its appointed course.  Life, faculties, production — in other words, individuality, liberty, property — this is man. And in spite of the cunning of artful political leaders, these three gifts from God precede all human legislation, and are superior to it. Life, liberty, and property do not exist because men have made laws. On the contrary, it was the fact that life, liberty, and property existed beforehand that caused men to make laws in the first place."

I argue the same occurs on the moral side. Laws should be based on pragmatist realities and not Christian moral truths. Legislating Christianity just makes people resent it. Additionally, the early Christians coexisted with worse regimes and did nothing to change those laws. Finally look to [1 Corinthians 5:12-13]. The law and government are amoral.

It's virtually impossible to read any of Paul's epistles or the book of Acts without being bombarded with the things the apostles and their disciples were doing to advance God's Kingdom.  Why are we settling for theological, philosophical, or ecumenical discussions that hit on ""teaching, rebuking, and correcting"" and completely ignoring the ""training"" aspect of the scriptures?

Christians,33vxfk,sandycheeks_beaches,3,Sun Apr 26 03:33:43 2015 UTC,"I would say debates over Eternal Security/OSAS is an example of a topic we could disagree, but still be saved. If one truly believes the Gospel and salvation through Jesus Christ - it doesn't matter whether you think you will loose your salvation or not - since you will be striving to live a Godly life and pursue to learn more in God's Word in either case.  Regarding actual dangerous doctrines, here's a summary of what to watch out for:   Looking over these warnings from Scripture, we may classify heresies into six major categories:       Heresies about revelation — teachings that distort, deny, or add to Scripture in a way that leads people to destruction; false claims to apostolic or prophetic authority. Heresies about God — teachings that promote false gods or idolatrous distortions of the true God. Heresies about Christ — denials of His unique Lordship, His genuine humanity, His true identity. Heresies about salvation — teaching legalism or licentiousness; denying the gospel of Christ's death and resurrection; and so forth. Heresies about the church — deliberate attempts to lead people away from the fellowship of true Christians; utter rejection of the church. Heresies about the future — false predictions for which divine authority is claimed; claims that Christ's return has taken place; and the like.  Note that errors in any one of these six categories tend to introduce errors into the other five... In short, heresy is any doctrine which the Bible explicitly labels as destructive, damning error; or a doctrine which the Bible instructs is not to be tolerated in the church; or any doctrine which, even if not mentioned in the Bible, utterly contradicts those truths which the Bible indicates are essential for sound Christian faith.

Christians,33vxfk,O_Matty,2,Sun Apr 26 03:51:46 2015 UTC,"A good one, and one that Paul actually considers, saying that both being married and being single are blessings (1 Corinthians 7:16).  He does consider being single the greater blessing, as it allows greater commitment to preaching the word, but that it isn't for everyone, particularly if the result of remaining single is to ""burn with lust"".  He states that ""each has his own gift from God, one of one kind and one of another""."

Christians,33vxfk,O_Matty,4,Thu Apr 30 09:31:53 2015 UTC,"I'm going to throw out a controversial one.  I don't think that denial of evolution is necessary to be a Christian.  A number of theologians have taken the line that God has revealed himself through two ""books"": Nature/science and the Bible.  Each of them is created and inspired by God, but fallible humans are capable of misinterpreting each.  Consequently, when there is a conflict between our interpretation of physical evidence (which points strongly to evolution) and our interpretation of Genesis (which points to a much abbreviated creation), we are left to ask, ""Which of these are we mis-interpreting?""  As the alternative - that God has deliberately misled us by making them contradictory - itself contradicts God's nature, either we must conclude that (a) our understanding of the science is wrong or (b) our interpretation of Genesis is wrong.  (Let's not concern ourselves with us having them both wrong.)  I always encourage my students to do their own research - particularly of those authors with a differing opinion to their own - in order to come to a conclusion that satisfies them.  My underlying reason for this approach is that I believe this debate impinges upon the basic tenets of salvation.  Neither answer denies the existence of God, his authority over creation, the purpose of humans to have a relationship with God, the presence of sin in humanity, the humanity and divinity of Jesus Christ, his death and resurrection in atonement for our sins, or the active presence of the Holy Spirit in the lives of Christians."
Christians,33vxfk,Gaming4JC,1 point,Sun Apr 26 07:19:37 2015 UTC,"I think that once one comes to Christ it won't be long before he/she has to choose between Creation or Evolutionism.   The reason is the dramatic shift in world-view. Even from so-called theological evolutionists perspective, if we evolved we are no more than mere animals, and survival of the fittest. This is not easily comparable to being designed in God's image and intelligent beings from the creation.  Also this affects Christ's lineage, for ultimately Christ would have came from his great-great ancestor: an ape.  Suggested reading: The Necessity for Believing in Six Literal Days"
Christians,33vxfk,ProtestantShoeString,1 point,Sun Apr 26 14:33:15 2015 UTC,I personally don't see a problem with humans evolving from apes. I think the simplest proof that shows we are created in God's image (and what makes us different from mere animals) is the soul. Whether we were created with it in an instant or God formed it over years as He formed our physical forms we are blessed with it and that is what matters.
Christians,33vxfk,faithfamilyfootball,0,Sun Apr 26 20:07:16 2015 UTC,No. Believing in God is to transcend that survival of the fittest way of living and to truly see heaven. You can believe in evolution and be a christian.
Christians,33vxfk,DracoIgnus,0,Thu Apr 30 00:11:49 2015 UTC,The bible is pretty clear when you look in to it that there was creation in seven days. Evolution requires death before the fall of man and kinda throws the whole salvation concept out of wack... It's not necessary no but it's a pretty big part of it.
Christians,33vxfk,Bman409,1 point,Mon Apr 27 16:57:56 2015 UTC,"I think Christians can disagree about the time-frame of creation, because that comes down to the definition of a ""day"". We know that with God a day is like a 1000 years. We know that a day to man is one rotation of the earth. (Not sure what a day was before the creation of the earth)... However, we know that God can extend a day to make it longer than 24 hours (as he did for Moses). The Bible doesn't say for certain.  Likewise, the Bible doesn't tell us the age of the Universe. Or the age of the earth.. Only that there was a ""beginning"". So all of those things are a matter of opinion.  Christians must believe in a literal Adam, since that's the source of sin in the world. Without Adam, no need for Christ. Without Christ, there's no ""Christianity"".  Christians can disagree about the timing of the rapture (or if there will be a rapture) but not the future second coming of Christ.   Christians can disagree on the whether or not we should keep the Sabbath, or tithe our money to the church.   Christians can disagree on many social topics, but ironically.. one of the areas where there is little wiggle room is the area of sexuality and sexual immorality. The Bible couldn't be more clear that sex is exclusively for married couples, and a Christian marriage can only be between one man and one woman (not polygamous or homosexual). That's the one that gets all the news coverage these days and the Bible doesn't really leave any wiggle room as far as I can see."
Christians,33vxfk,faithfamilyfootball,1 point,Wed Apr 29 13:24:01 2015 UTC,You don't think Jesus would be ok with two men or women truly in love to marry?  Even if they decide to abstain their whole lives?
Christians,33vxfk,bread_commander,1 point,Thu Apr 30 00:15:02 2015 UTC,"I would say as long as you do not deny the fundamental truths of the Christian Church, which are best set forth in the creeds, then you are still a Christian.   Even if your church is in error on one or more issues, you can still be a church.   Thus, I do not agree with some people who say that Catholics are not Christian, nor when people assert that a church body is not a ""real church"" because they support women's ordination or same-sex unions.  (I think this thinking should also be used to consider what parts of your theological beliefs might be in error.)"

Christians,33q4hg,puckpuncher3,3,Fri Apr 24 16:14:37 2015 UTC,"Usually, when it comes to praying for people who are sick or suffering, I will ask God to have mercy on them, and will add, ""if it is good, please heal their physical ailment.""       I pray in this way because something like cancer could have a profound spiritual effect on someone and bring them to contrition, repentance, turning away from vain, materialistic things. Someone I know has found God through cancer. He is suffering physically, but his soul is being transformed. It is actually one of the most profound transformations I have ever personally witnessed."
Christians,33q4hg,liquidmica,2,Sat Apr 25 04:29:30 2015 UTC,"This is a great question, and very valid. The relationship of prayer and God's will is itself somewhat a mystery, and I think by taking a look at the Scriptures, we can have a better understanding of these things.  To answer this question, we must look at the purpose of prayer itself. The first thing to understand is that God hears prayer, He answers prayer, and more than that, He commands prayer. In the Old Testament, we even see Samuel saying that it was a sin for him not to pray for God's people: ""Moreover, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the LORD by ceasing to pray for you, and I will instruct you in the good and the right way."" (1 Samuel 12:23 ESV)  So unquestionably, God desires to hear the prayers of His people, and He loves to answer them. Even James says, ""You do not have, because you do not ask. You ask and do not receive, because you ask wrongly, to spend it on your passions."" (James 4:2-3 ESV) And the famous chapter in Matthew 6 on anxiety teaches us that God is aware of all our needs, yet in Philippians 4 Pauls says, ""do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God."" (Philippians 4:6 ESV) God loves to answer the requests of His people!  This still leaves the question, why pray? The answer is simply this. Because this is one way that God has orchestrated that His will be done through His people. His sovereign will is intertwined with our prayers! It is an amazing thought, but it is wonderful. Even Paul the apostle asked the churches to pray for the success of his gospel ministry. Consider this passage:  At the same time, pray also for us, that God may open to us a door for the word, to declare the mystery of Christ, on account of which I am in prison—that I may make it clear, which is how I ought to speak. (Colossians 4:3-4 ESV)  Isn't that amazing? That Paul the apostle admitted that the success of God opening the door of the reception of the Gospel depended on prayer? But yet that is what He said. And we see this again by the words of Christ Himself, when he instructed us to pray for the raising up of gospel ministers,  Then he said to his disciples, “The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.” (Matthew 9:37-38 ESV)  Again, this is astounding and remarkable, that a sovereign God has chosen to use such broken vessels to accomplish such a great purpose through prayer. And what a remarkable thing it is, because this means that anyone can have a profound impact on the work of the kingdom!  Think of it this way, when we pray for anything, our prayer is incorporated into the sovereign will of God. Astoundingly, God ordained that some of His purposes are accomplished through our prayers, and that God ordained that we pray what we pray, and that God ordained the answer that He gives.   I hope this makes some sense. Again it's a great question and something I love to talk about."
Christians,33q4hg,Dying_Daily,2,Fri Apr 24 16:58:09 2015 UTC,"Bravo! I agree with everything you have said and I appreciate your pulling all the scripture, and you used all of the same ones I would know to use too!  The only thing left to add is that the primary purpose of prayer is to relate with God. Every other purpose is secondary to prayer as an expression of love and glory for God :)"

Yeah it is definitely amazing that we are called to be such an important part of the Kingdom. I think it is awesome that a lot of things in life and in my faith is such a mystery to me. A lot of things that I wont ever necessarily get an answer to.  Prayer is one of those topics for me. As a part of being a loyal Christian and obeying the bible, I will definitely continue to pray through everything. I will even pray to rid my mind of my doubt.   Through reading through the gospels, I have noticed that there is a continual trend of Jesus saying something along the lines of ""you are healed because of your faith"" while performing miracles. I think this is very important with prayer as well. To have faith that my prayers will be answered and to believe that anything is possible through God.   Thats really why I am asking what I am asking. I find myself doubting my prayers a lot while i pray. Fortunately, I believe that if i continue to pray to rid my mind of doubt, I will continue to grow in my prayer.  Thanks again brother"

I would like to know if anyone here used his faith (specifically Christian in this case) to get out of the rut?   I am not sure exactly what you are getting at here. Every aspect of a Christian's life is wrapped up in faith. We are a new creation in Christ, going through sanctification daily by the Holy Spirit. We dont ""use faith"" in this way, but are constantly trying to do better by the power of God.  If you lack motivation, I would say continue to focus on spiritual disciplines (prayer, fasting, devotional study, service) as well as find a Christian brother that can hold you accountable. You seem to be on the right track, I would make sure you are getting solid Biblical teaching and have a good group of Christians that can encourage you to run the race in such a way as to receive a crown of glory (1 Cor 9). You cant do it yourself, which is why the Church is so important to the Christian walk.  Feel free to PM me if you ever want to talk or pray."

Christians,32z19q,jalvarez4Jesus,7,Fri Apr 17 22:25:28 2015 UTC,"Friends, don't buy this garbage. The author mischaraterized Marlowe's views, I'm certain. The vast majority of Christians have believed throughout the centuries that what is truly inspired Scripture is the original readings of the NT, not necessarily the exact autographs, or original documents. What the original authors wrote. What it says is what is considered scripture, not the material they wrote it on. Yes, we have lost the autographs, but still have the inspired original readings by God's sovereign preservation.  The author has sunk his own boat when he talks about manuscripts and where the Johannine Comma (more commonly known as the Comma Johannine) shows up. When the author of this article admits that the JC doesn't show up until the middle ages he shows very clearly that the evidence obviously points to the fact that the JC wasn't original, and thus isn't inspired Scripture.   That means that only about 2.4% of the Greek manuscripts of 1 John 5:7-8 can be considered early. The other 97.6% are all late manuscripts. Since the Comma can only be found in late manuscripts, and since 97.6% of the Greek copies of 1 John 5:7-8 are all late manuscripts, the copies that contain the Comma bear the same “weight” age-wise as most of the copies of 1 John 5:7-8 that do not contain the Comma. The fact that the Comma is found in only late manuscripts is no problem at all for its authenticity.   Here he is taking what is called the ""majority view"" where whatever the majority of manuscripts say is what is inspired. This doesn't make sense if we're trying to understand what John himself wrote. The majority of manuscripts have small changes in them, and if someone made a mistake in the 5th century, that mistake is copied all the way through the 14th century, and thus becomes the majority. That's silly!  Further, this author doesn't seem to have any credentials in the scholarly field. Google him and you will find no credentials. I could be wrong about this, but I'm not finding any.  The author is also a KJV-Onlyist, a silly and very refutable position. Dr. James White has dealt with this position in a book, The King James Only Controversy. I have read it and was very edified in learning why we can trust our modern translations, why we can believe God has preserved His Word, and why the KJV is a good, but very flawed translation.  Here is a video of Dr. White giving a basic explanation of the whole thing.  I don't say these things to make a hit piece on the author, but to point out he doesn't have the credentials to be trusted on this, and that he has ulterior motives as to why he would advocate the authenticity of the JC.  Feel free to hit me up with questions.  Edit: Here, here, and here are some article further explaining the JC.

Christians,32z19q,BKA93,1 point,Sun Apr 19 20:35:24 2015 UTC,"How would it be? Inspiration is when the Holy Spirit causes an author to infallibly communicate truth.

The translation can still communicate Biblical truth and the translation is still considered the Word of God, but it isn't as if the translators of any translation were inspired to translate infallibly like the authors of the books of the Bible were.

Now, interpenetration of the text is a different issue.. we can see this by the way someone people say that some sinful behaviour is not sinful because of.a different interpretation of the text.

When I say a translation is ""inspired"" I mean a translation was guided supernaturally by God in the same way the authors of the originals were when they wrote them. I believe a good translation is close enough to the original text that we can understand what the original author intended, but isn't necessarily perfect.   The translation of an inspired text would still be, by definition, inspired.   Depends on what you mean by ""inspired"".  it seems to me that if we take this definition, I could have 6 months of Greek training, poorly translate a whole book and that work is automatically ""inspired""."

Christians,32x747,ElFuego87,3,Fri Apr 17 14:02:28 2015 UTC,"Thankfully, in the jurisdiction that I practice in we have just a couple attorneys who act like that, and even those are still not dishonest. Attorneys have a standard of professional responsibility and ethics requirements that are more stringent than about any other profession. This helps with behavior substantially.  However, for dealing with the ""sharks"" in the legal profession, I deal with them honestly and fairly while being a zealous advocate for my client. In the end of the day it is like dealing with any nasty person that any of us deal with. I attempt to treat them with grace and kindness in spite of their lack of it.  What makes me (and many other believing attorneys) different from those is that I am often more transparent and fair than they are. While I owe an obligation of being a zealous advocate for my client, I don't tend to play ""hide the ball"" with the court or with opposing counsel. I don't attempt to be sneaky in my work and try to pull stunts that some lawyers do."

It also helps that I don't think good lawyers act sneaky.  However, I do not want to answer God for acting in that way. And outside of that, the legal community is small and reputations are worth a lot.

Christians,32x747,kdz13,4,Fri Apr 17 14:13:35 2015 UTC,"You are correct. I do not do divorce work at all. Most divorces come from a non-Biblical basis. I do not do work that actively encourages sin, so I do not engage in divorce practice.  First off, a couple generally does not come to a divorce attorney. Generally one party does because there would be some inherent conflict issues representing both parties in a divorce, and in my experience, couples don't tend to mutually agree to divorce and go from there.  However, if I can apply the basic premise of your question to some work I do. Often, before I retain a client I explain what the representation will look like, and provide them information about their alternatives to a lawsuit. I do this in order to make sure a potential client understands their options as much as possible."

However, I encourage people to meet with an attorney after thinking about what you want done with your assets, and your opinion about who should take care of your minor children (the final say will go through the courts, but having your opinion set out is important), and whatever other things you want done after death. I think once a couple has children it is important to start this process, and update it as time moves on.   I know that this can be costly, but I encourage people to err on the side of caution and have this all laid out.

Along the same line, do you have your own firm in order to avoid ethically questionable scenarios?  One of my good friends' husband is a lawyer, who works for a local firm (in... banking, I think) and it seems like his work is always balancing on the edge of ethics--but it's hard to get a different job.

Christians,32x747,sc_q_jayce,3,Fri Apr 17 17:43:56 2015 UTC,Pretty similar to how I feel.
Christians,32x747,drjellyjoe,3,Fri Apr 17 18:19:13 2015 UTC,"I do some criminal work, so this issue comes up. First, as a criminal defense attorney, my job is to not prove the innocence of my client. My job is to do the best job for my client, by forcing the state to prove their case. In criminal work, that usually turns into getting the best plea for my client and making sure my client is not railroaded by the state. Even if a case goes to trial,  my job is to help a jury critically examine the state's case through cross-examination and bringing forth evidence that tends to show my client did not commit the act as charged. Criminal defense is a good example of where a lot of wisdom is prayed for.  I practice on my own for numerous reasons, but you are correct that a major reason for it is that I can select my own cases. I have friends in large firms who are forced to represent people I find reprehensible, so I am glad to do not have to deal with that.  I did not know I wanted to be a lawyer until I was a junior in undergrad. I was actually previously opposed to it. At the time an academic adviser suggested that I do a one hour internship at a local public defender's office and see if I liked it. I loved it and fell in love with the law as a result.   Recommending law as a career choice is an iffy issue. There was an enormous glut of young JD graduates leaving law schools for a long time, and as a result of the Great Recession, that has now stopped to some extent. Law school applications are at like a fifty year low and it seems like many of the reasons for applying to law school have diminished. At the end of the day, if someone wants to go to law school just to make money, that's a horrible idea. You are much better off getting a stem degree and going to an investment banking firm to make a ton of money. However, if someone loves the law and wants to do this for a career for fifty years, I suggest then it may be appropriate to choose law as a career choice."
Christians,32tzy5,SisterEsther,6,Thu Apr 16 18:24:04 2015 UTC,"This article pretty much hits the nail on the head, I'm currently in a church full of university students and the intolerant liberalism is strong when talking about social issues. If you disagree you'll rarely find someone willing to listen. Typically they try to silence you. And the funny thing is it's not about all social issues, it's just what's been in the news lately or what is the most visible. I hear time and again about the plights of people overseas, be refugees or war victims or whoever, or the LGBT movement but nothing about the ills in our own society (suicide, mental health, child abuse in the home, etc) which they are much better equipped and capable of fighting. Yet all I hear is crickets unless it's a headline. They lambaste the evils of foreign regimes and discrimination but say nothing about the dysfunction of my own country unless it falls under the umbrella of their crusade. It's frustrating at the best of times.  Then I look at the pulpit and I hear the same watered down crap from there as well. The leadership refuses to engage with this and give it clear Biblical framing and showing how deeply antithetical it is to Biblical Christianity. They just keep doing their pseudo-academic readings of the Bible and their off-topic sermons. Never once digging into these headliner issues and drilling down into what's really going on, the undermining of Biblical authority. If they accept that homosexual sex isn't sinful or fail to challenge this position then the rest of the Gospel is practically worthless.  I'm not advocating that we should grind these people under but should instead be willing to stand up and tell them they don't have halo's around their heads or light shinning out of their asses.  Last time I checked the Gospel was about spreading an uncompromised message of Jesus, not jumping on every bandwagon that comes along under the guise of ""social improvement"" and bending the Gospel to suite.  edit: typo"

Christians,32tzy5,pubmadison,3,Fri Apr 17 19:00:29 2015 UTC,"I agree, I think it is a matter of individual churches being willing to compromise doctrine in order to keep a healthily sized congregation. They make allowances because they think it is necessary, but that idea is not rooted in reality. I was in such a church for almost a year and never felt spiritually fulfilled, but now am a member of a Baptist congregation whose pastor does not compromise. We focus mostly on the gospel but of course on occasion a little bit of sociopolitical stuff gets peppered into sermons (and I've yet to hear anything contrary to the traditional conservative standpoints). Regardless of that, we have a thriving college-aged community who go independently of their families.  Plenty of ""young"" people prefer the Truth rather than the world. Even I was pretty liberal when I first entered into a conscious relationship with our Lord, but as my knowledge of Him and His Word grew, my former stances faded away. We do not need to - and should not - bend the Word to our will in order to live in the world. Tons of people my age understand that. I am sure that the current undermining of the Word in order to get people through the doors is something the enemy is rejoicing over, and we should act accordingly.

Christians,32tzy5,theplacewiththestuff,3,Fri Apr 17 19:38:30 2015 UTC,"I loved your comment   Thanks. It's encouraging to know I'm not the only one. However, you covered a central point that I missed:   I agree, I think it is a matter of individual churches being willing to compromise doctrine in order to keep a healthily sized congregation. They make allowances because they think it is necessary, but that idea is not rooted in reality. I was in such a church for almost a year and never felt spiritually fulfilled   This is another big problem. With so many issues around it. But whatever the issue it always comes down to the fact that a compromised church produces spiritually dead people. I'm seeing it happen in my current church and it grieves me immensely. The more I think about it and dive into the Bible to find a way through to these people the more I'm convinced they're spiritually blind, both the leadership and the congregants. It's because they can't perceive or have experienced the Spirit of God in their lives in a meaningful way that they focus on academic readings of the Bible and the world inevitably sneaks in. As Paul said:   12 For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places. (Eph 6:12)   The world sneaks in because at it's core it is a spiritual attack aimed at producing a compromised Gospel. Once you have a compromised Gospel you have the 2 Tim 3:6 issue:   holding to a form of godliness, although they have denied its power   They fight so hard to hold onto their congregation because the power of God is not there. Even if God was there they wouldn't be able to see or hear Him because they've been blinded spiritually. Like you said, the congregation will be robust if an uncompromised Gospel is preached.  So, I'm genuinely asking this, how do you get blind people to see? God has put me in my current church (long story) and I see the spiritual desert every time I go there and whole lot of lost sheep. I've talked to the leaders and they're either too busy or throw this all back in my face. How can I get through? I open to ideas."

My knee-jerk answer is, ""With the senses they have left."" To unpack that a bit, if one way does not work - try another. Maybe that means using the same basic message with a different tone, or creating art, or speaking to different people, or bringing in third party assistance, or deliberately behaving in different ways that will nudge people toward what you hope they will realize as the Truth. I have made a fool of myself many times because I was working on another person and ignoring myself. When we obey His command to die unto ourselves, we see more opportunities and options because we are no longer concerned with how we fit into the equation.

Christians,32t85e,TheRealCestus,6,Thu Apr 16 21:13:40 2015 UTC,"The doctrine of perseverance of the saints is not at odds with any Scripture you have stated and is held by the Reformed school of thought. Basically, it is the idea that since God foreknows all things. We can see that all Christian names are already in the Book of Life, those people are preserved; all others are damned, they just dont know it yet (Rev 20:12-15). The bulk of the discussion comes down to belief and unbelief. Clearly, unbelievers are damned, but can a person who once believed to somehow cease believing? Is it possible for our nature to change and then to willingly revert to unrighteousness? I believe Scripture to give us a resounding ""no.""  Let us look to Hebrews 6. The context of the passage is about moving beyond basic understanding of Scripture. The author is writing to a group of Jews that were aware of the Gospel accounts, aware of the OT law, and aware of the rejection of Christ by thousands of their kin. When Christ came and performed miracles and brought the Gospel directly to many Jews, they recognized God's hand and yet rejected it in favor of some other idol. For these men, they chose to reject OT prophecy, God's miracles, and the Messiah in the form that he came; there will be no ""second Gospel"" for them, no new crucifixion for their sins. In this way, the truth was revealed, yet they never had, nor never will have true repentance and imputed righteousness. (See also Rom 11; I Tim 1)  By comparison, we have a wealth of text on perseverance. For me, Romans 8 is one of the most encouraging and beautiful chapters in all of Scripture. Paul teaches that we have free will only once we have been imputed Christ's righteousness. We then choose freely to run the race of God's will or not, but this has no bearing on salvation, which we have already received. We choose to be led by the Spirit, to suffer in the present in order to attain future glory. He makes no mention of true believers falling away, only of our responsibility to keep running by God's strength. The end of the chapter speaks for itself here:    What, then, shall we say in response to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? 32 He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all—how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things? Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies. Who then is the one who condemns? No one. Christ Jesus who died—more than that, who was raised to life—is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? As it is written: “For your sake we face death all day long;     we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.”  No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord."" (Rom 8: 31-38)   There are a bunch more verses on God's sovereign, unchangeable redemption here for your perusal (John 5:24; John 10:27-29; Romans 8; Eph. 1:4; II Tim. 1:12; I John 2:19). The bottom line is that nowhere does Scripture talk about one of God's redeemed ever falling away. No one has the power to pluck us from God's hand, not even ourselves. This does not mean that we should keep sinning that grace may abound (Rom 6:1), but rather that we are motivated by the richness and depth of God's grace and love. If this is not a motivation for someone, then they need to work out their salvation with fear and trembling, for they may very well not be in the Book of Life (Phil 2:12). We are known by love and by our fruit, only by those things can we prove we are in Christ (John 13; Gal 5).  This is a very quick response.

Christians,32t85e,drjellyjoe,2,Thu Apr 16 16:53:48 2015 UTC,"There are a bunch more verses on God's sovereign, unchangeable redemption here for your perusal (John 5:24; John 10:27-29; Romans 8; Eph. 1:4; II Tim. 1:12; I John 2:19). The bottom line is that nowhere does Scripture talk about one of God's redeemed ever falling away. No one has the power to pluck us from God's hand, not even ourselves. This does not mean that we should keep sinning that grace may abound (Rom 6:1), but rather that we are motivated by the richness and depth of God's grace and love. If this is not a motivation for someone, then they need to work out their salvation with fear and trembling, for they may very well not be in the Book of Life (Phil 2:12). We are known by love and by our fruit, only by those things can we prove we are in Christ (John 13; Gal 5).   Thanks for this explanation. Very helpful.  One thing that I'm reacting to is the notion that I have seen offered by evangelists from time to time that salvation is simply a matter of confessing your sins and believing that Christ died for you and ""accepting"" him as your savior...   It IS that simple, but ""believing in your heart"" means a radical change in one's life away from sin to pursue godliness and holiness and the character of Christ.. for as 1 John says,    If we claim to have fellowship with him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not live out the truth. 7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all[b] sin.   and later in the same book,    3 We know that we have come to know him if we keep his commands. 4 Whoever says, “I know him,” but does not do what he commands is a liar, and the truth is not in that person. 5 But if anyone obeys his word, love for God[a] is truly made complete in them. This is how we know we are in him: 6 Whoever claims to live in him must live as Jesus did.   it is not possible to ""believe"" and continue willingly in sin."

Unfortunately, many people have been the victim of evangelism without discipleship. Today with the pervasiveness of the seeker sensitive movement and ""church as business"" ecclesiology we have many people who are presented with a form of the Gospel, but without its power. These people are inoculated against faith because they think they are saved, yet have no joy of the Lord and so dismiss Christianity as another failed self-help attempt. Our salvation does not depend on what we claim to believe, it only matters if Christ claims us as his own. People who do not demonstrate fruit of repentance and love of others completely miss the Gospel, much like the people in Heb 6 did."
Christians,32t85e,VerseBot,2,Thu Apr 16 17:51:00 2015 UTC,"Php 1:6  Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ:  John 13:27 - And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly.  Luke 22:31-32  And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:  (32)  But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.  Both Judas and Peter betrayed Christ. One was a believer and one wasn't. Both were predicted by Christ. With Judas, Christ predicted what he would do by telling him to do it quickly, and he dismissed him. With Peter, Christ made the same type of prediction about betrayal, but Christ tells him that he has prayed for him so that when (not if) he returns he will strengthen the brethren.  Hebrews 7:25-27  Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.  (26)  For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;  (27)  Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.  Rom 8:34  Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.   1Jn 2:1  My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:   Although the work of Christ on the cross was completed for our salvation (""it is finished"" is evident), he rose again and then ascended to the right hand of the Father. From the above verses we see that Christ didn't just ascend to heaven to become the King of kings but to be a high priest who intercedes for us. We know that Jesus is the only mediator between men and God, and not Mary or angels. So, what is the purpose of his intercession? By the power of Christ, the great high priest who makes intercessetion for us, he sustains the elect by his grace. We are not dependent on ourselves to make it safely till our death, we have eternal life and will not lose it because of the grace of God."

There is a sister in my church who works for Wycliffe and I think that her missionary work is great. But ever since I found out that they have been involved with this 'insider movement' I have become wary of them. I also read recently about one case where they did a translation for some South American natives, and they seem to think that they are too stupid to understand scripture so they dumb it down so much that the verses sometimes have completely different meanings."

That being said, there is no prohibition against intentional, specific use and there is even evidence to support that some amount of vulgarity was used in the Bible, esp in the prophets to describe sin (Isa 36:12; 1 Sam 25:22, 34; 1 Kin 14:10; 16:11; 21:21; 2 Kin 9:8; 18:27; Phil 3:8). The bottom line: are you exalting Christ or demeaning him through your vulgarity?"
Christians,32qd57,TheRealCestus,11,Wed Apr 15 22:12:49 2015 UTC,"I think that it is absolutely not okay to take the name of the Lord in vain. I think that the vain and mindless use of words which have a sexual meaning is sinful.  Exodus 20:7  - Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.   When you use the name of the Lord as a cuss word or use it carelessly it is breaking the third commandment.  Ephesians 4:29 - Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.   1 Peter 3:10 - For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:   Matthew 15:11 - Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.   Luke 6:45 - A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.   James 3:9-11  Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.  (10)  Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.  (11)  Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?  These verses speak against corrupt and guile communication. James 3:9-11 speaks against using the same lips which praise God to curse men, so James is demonstrating the sinfulness of cursing. I see these verses speaking against any slander, malice, evil, etc. Jesus spoke about how we will speak what is in his heart, and if his heart is evil then evil words will come out his mouth. Think about how using foul words which carry sexual meanings can show what our heart is like. I see the use of rotten and foul words as corrupt communication.  2 Kings 18:27 - But Rabshakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men which sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you?   The verse above contains language which may offend people, yet it is still given by inspiration of God.   It is clear from many verses that name calling can be a godly thing to do. In Isaiah 56:10-11 God called the prophets ""dumb dogs"" and ""greedy dogs"". In Matthew 7:6 Jesus likened the hard hearted to ""dogs"" and ""swines"". In Luke 13:32 Jesus called Herod a ""fox"". In Titus 1:12-13 Paul agreed that the Cretians were ""evil beasts"" and ""slow bellies"". The language used in these verses are certainly vulgar and offensive to some people, yet they are all used righteously.  To conclude, cursing and corrupt communication is definitely sinful, but name calling can be done in a righteous manner. I advise you not to use swear words, and that your speech honour and please God. Corrupt communication reflects what kind of heart you have, and as Christians are given a new heart by God we ought to reflect that in our speech."

Christians,32qd57,backstretch,5,Sun Apr 26 15:42:27 2015 UTC,"In addition to the good comments here, I would invite you to meditate on the root motive and reason in your heart that you desire to use vulgar words. Almost always the motives for swearing are for self-pleasing rather than God-glorifying purposes. These words are typically used to express anger or cast insults or mockery, which followers of Christ must renounce. Or they can be used to draw narcissistic attention to oneself (e.g. ""I'm the cool Christian who swears""). Christians must also consider how they may offend their brothers and sisters. Not only that, but swear words are mostly associated with the impulsive careless speech of the unholy. Christians are to be separate from the world, avoiding even the appearance of evil. Christians are a holy nation set apart for the good works of God. Considering these things, only in the most extremely rare cases would using a vulgar word be appropriate. Given that, it is far better to just not do it."

Christians,32qd57,theearstohear,1 point,Sat May 2 20:59:09 2015 UTC,"I'd like to point out that ""taking the Lord's name in vain"" is not something so mundane as using a swear word and the word ""God"" together. We are commanded not to take the Lord's name in vain by claiming that God has commanded, forbidden, or ordained things that he has not. This is a commandment against lying about God's nature, to give extra credence to your own messed up beliefs, or for manipulating people around you who aren't well versed enough to know that you're acting as a false prophet, cult leader, or heretic.  Taking the Lord's name in vain is MUCH more serious than a potty mouth. I think swearing falls under ""not causing others to stumble."" If your language is going to poorly represent Christ to non Christians who are scrutinizing you to see if and how you're different, or if it's going to cause fellow Christians to stumble, then yes, swearing in those cases can absolutely be sinful.  I think there are rare few occasions where it is not, or even good. Expressing outrage at something heinous can have greater impact if the right filthy language is used. I'll also not, that people who swear all the time have trouble getting much mileage out of individual swear words. Essentially if you're always at a 10 with your language, you might as well be always at a 2 as well and you've got nowhere to go.  When you ask the questions, ""is it okay to..."" you're really asking if it's a sin or not. A good general rule about identifying something as sinful is to determine if it's helping you align yourself with God by putting your own wants and needs subservient to His, or if the behavior is self serving.  A hard and fast rule about all cussing is unlikely to be as useful, as individually analyzing your hear and mind when you do cuss and when you want to cuss.  I'd wager that the large majority of filthy language is sinful or at best useless. But I think it has it's (very small) place."

Christians,32n60g,OctoDerp,5,Wed Apr 15 03:07:21 2015 UTC,"I was raised agnostic (unsure about a god/gods) and occasionally went to church (once a year or less). Everything I saw about Christianity seemed like a waste of time and I was content to live without any god. I thought Christians were simply weak minded or lacked the strength to go through life and clung to superstition and fellowship that church brought them. I was not even seeking God, never mind any kind of peace through faith when I was converted.  A friend of mine shared the Gospel with me, and I realized that I was a sinner, eternally separate from God through my own  actions (sin). Christ revealed Himself to me and took my sin upon himself in order to bring me into peace with him. By God's grace I realized my deep need for salvation, that is the only way to become a Christian. This is immeasurably comforting now, that no matter how good or bad I am, my sins have been removed from me by God's power, not my own.   The ""notion of a god"" does not even begin to encompass what God is. He is more real than we are, his creative hand has made all we see and discover, and set in motion all that we imagine. If God was merely a set of guidelines or someone to be feared, he wouldnt be worth our time. But he is our reason for existence, we can only find true joy and peace through Christ. Of course, we are called to live lives that reflect that redemption, and so we do hold ourselves to the Bible as a guideline, but that is a result of what has already happened on the cross.  Is God helpful? For me, he turned a sociopathic, calloused, hateful kid and redeemed me by his love. My only goal used to be self preservation and pleasure, no matter who had to suffer or sacrifice for it. God changed my hard heart and gave me a love for others, and in service I have found more joy than all the years of selfishness could have ever produced. When you finally realize all the emptiness your sin could not fill can be filled by Christ, you will never be the same.   I hope and pray that you will one day come to understand the infinite gravity of God, the incomprehensible love and joy that is to be found in Christ, but that can only happen by his grace.

Fast forward a few years, and I'm 19 now with deep roots in my relationship with God and my life as a Christian.   No matter where you are in life, you will always look for answers somewhere. You'll ask questions and the answers you find will fall short of the answer you need, and so you will continue to look. The only possible way to find the answer, is from God.  I know God. Notice what I said brother. I know Him. I'm not saying ""I know God exists"", or ""I know of a presence of a God."" I know God. I know God just as well as you know your father or a best friend. You don't know of your father... you know your father.  God gives me comfort. It's in our relationship. Just the other day, I was struggling with patience and I was getting so angry, and short tempered. God comforted me. Told me to not worry, and I sucked it up, and kept marching through my agravation.  You can know God too buddy. Through Jesus, anyone can have a relationship with God. Even you, man.

If you read the Book of Ecclesiastes in the Bible, you'll read exactly how I feel, without God.  Without God, life is being meaningless.. its actually a terrible stroke of bad luck. You come in to existence, and from the day you are born, everything you do in life is a struggle against ""loss"". Loss of your possession (you go to work to earn money to keep this from happening).. loss of your friends and family (10s of thousands in medical bills to prevent this).. loss of happiness (booze, free time, yoga, whatever works, I guess)... and then one day, you lose it all anyway..and you die (after years of hard work, suffering, stressing, etc).  Its like somone puts you in a boat near the top of a waterfalls and says... start rowing, or your going over the edge....  go as long as you can, but know this.. in the end, your arms will fail you and you're going over anyway! ! Try to have as much fun as you can, until then (as you watch loved ones go over)... Have a nice day!  The ultimate torture.   Fortunately, for us, God never intended to create man just to torture him with the knowledge of death in the future... The gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord! There is now hope! There is peace.. There is actually a moral basis for ""right and wrong"" and there's a point to showing love... Every good thing that happens in this world now has meaning!   I can't imagine existing without a relationship with God. The idea that man is the only intelligent force in the Universe, left to drift aimlessly on this minuscule floating ball in space for his 80 years of life, or whatever.. that's almost too terrible to contemplate, isn't it?"

Christians,32hdoh,mwerte,6,Tue Apr 14 13:38:19 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love this article. Many people like to say ""Why do you focus on homosexuality so much and not other sins?"" Because I can call those things sin and not be labeled a hateful bigot.   I'm constantly reminded of the quote by Rick Warren,“Our culture has accepted two huge lies. The first is that if you disagree with someone’s lifestyle, you must fear or hate them. The second is that to love someone means you agree with everything they believe or do. Both are nonsense. You don’t have to compromise convictions to be compassionate."

I disagree with this statement.  Sexual immorality as a whole is celebrated, idolatry is celebrated (get as much money so you can retire early to the Bahamas), and the others are celebrated to some degree as well (""man, I downloaded that new album, it's awesome!"").  The rest of the article is good stuff though."

Christians,325pmz,JuiceBusters,2,Tue Apr 14 17:32:05 2015 UTC,"Agree. I imagine (granted this is imagination based on what I read) but Mohammad DOES 'get' monotheism and he may very well be getting it from Christian, Jewish and maybe Zoroastrianism. So, okay great so far. Fantastic.   But then I always have this 'impression' Mohammad gets wildly frustrated with the 'Trinity' idea (which he seems to think its Mary, Jesus, God) and almost angrily just wants to declare that pointless and wrong to 'Keep it simple sucker'.  I suppose the satanic verses or whatever this thing with 3 daughters of Allah could mix in that too... tho I haven't studied enough of that  But one thing Christians (esp here in the West) need to take away is the reminder that while WE apprehend one true God (revealed to us in .. for lack of a better word... 3 'persons') Muslims around the world understand this from Mohammads misconception AND just assume some kind of polytheism is going on.   So its important to see the topic from how their perceptions and presumptions.   BTW: this was a refreshingly well-moderated civil debate. Which was encouraging and helpful!"

Christians,324twf,faintpremonition,6,Fri Apr 10 16:16:37 2015 UTC,"I have a hard time using Old Testament law for the Israelite theocracy as an example for other governments. The only true Theocracy in human history has many special cases around it, and directly applying its law to our non-theocratic government is problematic. Nowhere in the Bible does it indicate that Theocratic law should be the legal framework for all future governments, so my reading of those histories are for historical understanding of events in Israelite secular and spiritual development.  There were a lot of death penalty crimes under the Theocracy. And, I believe that with God as the head of state, execution for crimes that we consider too small for the death penalty was justified under that system. However God is not our head of state, we have imperfect justice, and I think that's cause to be ultra careful with the death penalty. We're more likely to misuse it than God, after all! Also, I think unless you're willing to argue the death penalty for say, certain forms of adultery and various/sundry other sexual sins, that citing Theocratic precedent alone as justification for the death penalty is an insufficient defense.  I do appreciate that the author elaborated on the position with New Testament thought about the state wielding the sword, however I would have opened with this, and perhaps relied on it exclusively.  I support the use of the death penalty for crimes of an extreme or grotesque nature, however not for deterrence purposes. In fact punishments of any kind have little to no deterring effect on career criminals. Deterrence is non-viable as the sole justification of any criminal punishment.  I think there's some fascinating information about crime and punishment, specifically for the American audience here: http://lawcomic.net/guide/?page_id=5#crimlaw  I recommend reading it, especially if you want to know more about the effects and function of criminal punishment, and the legal framework for why we have what we have. I'll put in a caveat. It's NSFW because of subject matter (crimes of all types,) mild line drawing nudity, and language. It does not glorify depravity, however it addresses it, because perceived depravity IS a factor in how crimes are tried punished. You have been warned."

A proper functioning government in a healthy society would be capable of recognizing that and administering it justly.  But we have far from a capable government in the US. The system relies too heavily on individuals (Judge and prosecutor) who often are closely tied and corrupt. The jury almost always be capable of rending a just unanimous verdict, if it were allowed to see all the evidence both regarding the crime and the character of the accused, etc.   Evidence is hidden and manufactured. The police have no calm whatsoever of lying or planting evidence.  The system and the society are so corrupt that I cannot support the death penalty. Society as a whole has no regard for the Bible, so placing your hand on the Bible and vowing to tell the ""truth"" is a joke. Its an abomination,actually, if you believe the Bible to be a LIE!   What we have today is more like the Romans and Jews of 1st century Israel..

U.S. Catholic Bishops take a similar stance, pointing out the flagrant injustice in how the death penalty is applied but still hold that the death penalty is warranted under very specific conditions.

As a matter of fact, I think we should adamantly oppose it.   I understand that the State has authority, and we must submit to it. However, I don't think that means that we shouldn't oppose it.  There is a collection of John Howard Yoder essays on it called The End Of Sacrifice.

""Since the death of Jesus brought a decisive end to sacrifices for sin, Christians should proclaim its abolition, and death penalty advocates should no longer claim validation. In Yoder's words, 'It is the clear testimony of the New Testatment, especially of the epistle to the Hebrews, tha the ceremonial requirements of the Old Covenant find their end--both in the sense of fulfillment and in the sense of termination--in the high-priestly sacrifice of Christ. 'Once for all' is the good news. Not only is the sacrifice of bulls and goats, turtledoves and wheatcakes at an end; the fact that Christ died for our sins, once for all, the righteous one for the godless (Heb 9:26-28; 1 Peter 3:18), puts an end to the entire expiatory system, whether it be enforced by priests in Jerusalem or by execution[ers] anywhere else"" (15-16)."
Christians,324twf,pilgrimboy,0,Fri Apr 10 17:13:40 2015 UTC,"And  ""The new level of brotherhood in which the redeemed community is to live cannot be directly enforced upon the larger society; but if it be of the gospel, it must work as a leaven, as salt, and as light, especially if, as in the case in the Anglo-Saxon world, the larger society claims some kind of Christian sanction for itse existence and social pattern. If Christ is not only prophet and priest but also king, the line between church and world cannot be impermeable to moral truth. Something of the cross-bearing forgiving ethics of the kingdom must be made relevant to the civil order (35-36)."

In the old testament there was also the eye-for-an-eye-concept and you could easily divorce from your wife and marry another one or even more than one, so I think we should really carefully apply the old testament onto our lifes today. Furthermore just a single man or woman who got executed without being the guilty one is too much.

Christians,324twf,backstretch,1 point,Fri Apr 10 21:22:48 2015 UTC,"I believe that Christians should hope, pray and strive for a society in which the death penalty, rightly and rarely applied, would make moral sense.  This would be a society in which there is every protection for the rights of the accused, and every assurance that the social status of the murderer will not determine the sentence for the crime.   I agree with this.  But I think he's far too optimistic about the ability of a fallen world to ever meet that requirement.  I also found his dismissal of cruel and unusual punishment -- as botched lethal injections surely are -- a little unnerving.  I agree with capital punishment in theory, but I am unconvinced that it is plausible in reality."
Christians,324twf,dadashton,1 point,Mon Apr 13 18:40:56 2015 UTC,"I think the argument that we have imperfect justice, therefore we cannot make a moral defense for capital punishment doesn't work.  The same could be held for any justice that is decided.  The beauty of our system is that it constantly seeks improvement.  Bad judges are culled out; some of them much later then what we'd like, but neverless they are soon gone.  Each of the first five books of the OT make a very clear statement that one's life must be taken for the deliberate act of killing another human being made in the image of God.  That deliberate killing is universally held as murder. And to use the argument that OT law is not applicable today would be completely rejected by our founding fathers.  Unless I'm missing something here, all ten commandments are recorded in the Torah.  And - as NT believers, we don't dismiss the punitive penalties for stealing or bearing false witness."

Christians,3241nd,jalvarez4Jesus,3,Fri Apr 10 17:21:55 2015 UTC,"The Authorized Version.  First of all, let me present the practical reasons for the superioty of the KJV. Many people criticise the KJV because of its archaic language. This mainly being the pronouns such as ""thee"" and ""ye"". But I will explain the importance of the pronouns. I first explain that with the ""you"" pronouns there is plural and singular. If it begins with ""t"" then it is singular and if it begins with ""y"" (including ""you"") then it is plural.  Here is a good article about the importance of the pronouns. The fact is that when William Tyndale made his translation he preserved the archaic pronouns as the distinctions are found in the Hebrew and Greek scriptures, and this of course gives us an accurate understanding.  Another practical reason is that, unlike the new versions, there are words which are italicized, and that is because they are not in the original texts but are there so that the sentences make sense in English. This is great as we know what words the translators put in and which are in the original texts.      Now, let me present to you the textual reasons for why I use the KJB. Are you aware that the new versions use a Greek New Testament that is heavily reliant upon the Alexandrian text types? Are you aware that the ""oldest and best texts"" (Sinaiticus and Vaticanus) were written in the same century yet have 3,036 variations? Are you aware that they are the reason why you find those faith destroying footnotes which tell you that chunks of the Word of God should be taken out?   I do not believe that the purest text was a text which was discarded in some bin and left there for 1500 years (Codex Sinaiticus). I do not believe that the purest text was preserved in the the Vatican library (Codex Vaticanus). I do not believe that the purest text is a text which has been corrected many thousands of times, making it one of the most corrected manuscripts in existence.  I implore you to look into this matter. I run a subreddit on this matter, and I would appreciate it if you visited it. Here are some examples of my posts. Thank you for reading, and God bless."

I'm a little dismayed that many christians I know are 1). surprised by the situation in Indiana and across the country, and 2) almost in a hysterical panic.   Isn't the Bible CLEAR that you will be persecuted if you are a christian? (1 Timothy 3:12)?  Has no one read 1 Peter 4:12-14?   12 Dear friends, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal that has come on you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you. 13 But rejoice inasmuch as you participate in the sufferings of Christ, so that you may be overjoyed when his glory is revealed. 14 If you are insulted because of the name of Christ, you are blessed, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you.    Or do these verses apply to ""someone else"".. You know.. the early church, or christians living in Iraq.. but surely not to US , here in God's chosen nation of America (where is the scripture to back that up, btw??)  The church is getting a wake-up call, and frankly, I'm excited about it. I want to see the wheat separated from the chaff.. I want to see how God gives me the strength to endure... I'm not HAPPY about it.. but I'm ""rejoicing"" as Peter says.  It always bothered me that Christians in America got along so well with our pagan society. It felt like we must be doing something wrong, if the world loved us. Now I can see that the Bible was right all along when it said """"If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first."""
Christians,31vdvx,inalltheforreals,3,Wed Apr 8 13:35:11 2015 UTC,"It's an awesome story you have there.  Have you found other Christians you can fellowship with?  Are you part of a local church yet, with elders and other who can counsel you and other mentors? They can help you with specifics about your situation.  I am sure others can help you find a local body if you are seeking one that truly represents the faith.  I threw away all my tarot cards and books when I realized these were not just false teaching, but an abomination.  (You know how I got into tarot cards?  A video game.  Next thing I know, I have my own waite-rider deck, and books, and it just goes on.)  I know it's hard to imagine how much money you're throwing away, but it will be worth it.  It would be better to not give it to someone else.  The hard thing is realizing it's not a matter of what's more pragmatic (saving money, conserving supplies), but knowing that the only use of these objects is only for evil.  There is no way of using these items for redeeming purposes.  It would be interesting to read about the Kings who ruled over Judah and realized how horrible it was to worship false Gods.  They burned and destroyed all the different forms of worshiping them (poles, idols, high places) when convicted.  Even in [Acts 19:11-20] they burned all their books and items related to the magic arts.  And even with Wicca or tarot or other things similar to that, while they are false, they do deal with a spiritual realm that is far more dangerous than we realize.  It is wise not to play in them or even encourage it in others."

I actually felt less guilty about it once it was out of the house.  To answer your question, I have just a few Christian friends right now but haven't yet gotten involved in a church. Part of it is an issue of being uncomfortable around new people, especially in large groups (social anxiety) which I'm still working on and that alone has been a big struggle for me. So I'm considering maybe looking for just something small for now and see where God takes me since I'm not really sure how else to go about it."

[13] Then some of the itinerant Jewish exorcists undertook to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, “I adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul proclaims.” [14] Seven sons of a Jewish high priest named Sceva were doing this. [15] But the evil spirit answered them, “Jesus I know, and Paul I recognize, but who are you?” [16] And the man in whom was the evil spirit leaped on them, mastered all of them and overpowered them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. [17] And this became known to all the residents of Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks. And fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was extolled. [18] Also many of those who were now believers came, confessing and divulging their practices. [19] And a number of those who had practiced magic arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all.

For once I thought Joyce was a true woman minister, and I had no doubt many women have gotten healing through her words, lately I have realized and came to term much of her teachings revolve around ""feelings and emotions"", and there should be a balance of grace and wrath.   Now on the subject of ""does anyone one of us get it right?"" , I am not sure I can claim any denomination or any teacher has the most accurate interpretation or doctrines panned out-- due to the fallen nature in all of  us- pastor, priest, teacher, evangelist, on top of traditions being generated down. I can choose one that is encouraging the personal faith to God only by grace alone, and it is the believer's duty to study the words diligently.

Christians,31btm1,Gaming4JC,4,Fri Apr 3 17:06:22 2015 UTC,"I was reading this passage yesterday, and it actually caused me to change my mind regarding the Indiana law, etc. I still believe that you should have the religious freedom to decline business that goes against your beliefs.. but as a christian personally, I don't think I'd have a problem selling a wedding cake to a gay couple. As Paul points out, our prohibition against associating with sinners is confined to fellow believers. What business do we have in judging the world (In the sense that one sin we will tolerate, while another we will not)? As Paul says, we'd have to leave this world altogether to avoid sinners!   So, I don't think its a problem to do business with sinners. Sell them their cake. Rent them a limo. Book their vacation through your travel agency, etc.,etc, all the while sharing the good news of Christ with them.. But we must hold fellow believers to a much higher standard, and throw the sinners out (if they fail to heed correction). I'd say the church has a long way to go just to meet this standard, before starting to worry about the rest of the world.  So in short, I'm against gay marriage for members of the church. I'm against gay sex. I'm against divorce except in cases of adultery. I'm against adultery. I'm against drunkeness.  I'm against idolatry (covetousness). Those things should not be tolerated in the body of believers.  What the rest of the world does, honestly, is not my primary business. This world isn't my home, anyway. I'm only passing through. And if my master was telling the truth, they're not going to like me here, no matter what I do."

Do you think that Paul might have sold tents to sinners? I kind of think he might have. Maybe even fornicators? I bet he did. As a christian, I've thought alot about this issue, and this passage from 1 Corinthians is the clearest yet (to me) about how Christians should conduct themselves with the world. If someone thinks I'm totally wrong, please let me know. I'm not adverse to correction! I welcome it."

""Surprisingly"" no one is asking for my opinion..LOL  that said, as a christian, I personally wouldn't have guilt about selling items to sinners. The issue of supporting certain ceremonies, etc.. is a bit more trickly. Would I want to cater a gay wedding?  How about a wedding between two divorced nonbelievers who left their spouses for each other after a secret adulterous affair?  I think its a matter for prayer and counsel with other believers.  At the end of the day, you have to do what the Holy Spirit is telling you to do, regardless of the ""Law"". That's why I'm not all that concerned with these laws that seem to be going against christians. That's to be expected. I'm 45 years old.. I'm thankful to God that I've lived most of my life in a country and time when there was quite a bit of freedom. I haven't really been subject to persecution for my faith.

But it is not a typical one of trans people in general: of the (several hundred) trans folk I know, none have a comparable history. I can tell you that I certainly did not; I had a stable childhood in a rural Southern town with an evangelical family.  Many studies further indicate that these results are not typical either: here is a five-year followup with ~90% satisfaction, here is another with 97%, and studies of reasons for regret indicate that it tends to be more about function than about having the surgery per se.  If you want to object on Biblical grounds, I suppose that's your prerogative. But the data does not support the idea that this is a common occurrence."

You're also dealing with people who transitioned decades ago, when modern surgical techniques and bioidentical hormones were not available. Here is one on people who transitioned in their teens, with mean follow-up seven years after starting puberty-blocking drugs, although generally not long after surgery per se.   Even the testimony of this 70-something said that after his surgery he ""was happy for a while.""   ""A while"" here seems pretty short-term: he was drinking heavily by the three-year mark, to the point that an intervention was necessary (so presumably some dissatisfaction occurred well before that). That's well within the range covered by the studies already linked.   How long has it been since you had your surgery?   I haven't had, and do not plan to have, genital surgery.

If he was truly supposed to be a woman, should he have held on to that? What are your thoughts on that?   I haven't had, and do not plan to have, genital surgery.

If he was truly supposed to be a woman, should he have held on to that? What are your thoughts on that?   I doubt he was trans (i.e., had a female gender identity) in the first place, and would guess that this was simply missed by the therapists he was seeing. It's a rare issue, and judging by the bad reception he got as a child and no mention that he brought those issues up with said therapists, I think it's very possible they weren't mentioned. It wasn't that he was trans, it's that he (mistakenly) believed that transition would 'fix' things; he specifically notes that he went for it because he 'felt like he had nothing to lose'.  So I would say that here, we actually have a pretty clear case of how gender identity can rear its head in someone who isn't trans. By mistakenly transitioning, he began to feel actual dysphoria and to notice an identity that had been in the background before transitioning. There's precedent for this: David Reimer is sort of the poster-child example. Reimer was raised as a girl after a botched circumcision under the (then-current, now long-defunct) theory that he'd adopt a female gender identity as a result. He didn't, and ended up displaying exactly the symptoms we'd expect of a trans man (that's 'FTM', to be clear) and ultimately transitioned to living as a man after learning of his history.   He wasn't ""supposed"" to be a woman (I wouldn't say anyone is ""supposed"" to be a man or a woman in a metaphysical sense, but that's a side point) in the first place, and transitioning didn't change that, any more than not transitioning would change it in a person who is genuinely trans.   If I might ask, what are your reasons for only doing hormones, rather than a full surgery?   Surgery is expensive and risky, and cannot currently provide fertility. I'd very much like to carry a child, but without that ability it's simply not worth the cost and risk. I don't consider myself any less of a woman for not having had it, and it's not a thing that anyone but doctors and sexual partners is likely to ever really deal with. I may reconsider in the future, especially if lab-grown uteruses become available (they're working on it!), but I think that's unlikely within my reproductive lifetime."

Interesting. So you believe he thought he was trans but was just confused. Huh.   I may reconsider in the future, especially if lab-grown uteruses become available (they're working on it!), but I think that's unlikely within my reproductive lifetime.   Something curious you said earlier, that you don't feel any less of a woman for not having had surgery. In my mind this logic means that ""woman"" ultimately has nothing to do with body parts. Since you believe that you can pick and choose which body parts and functions you would like and not like, then who's to say any combination or lack thereof defines ""woman""? Since, in your view, a person can be a woman with or without surgery, then do you not see a philosophical contradiction of your beliefs? If ""woman"" can be defined without physical characteristics, then why go to the trouble to even have estrogen supplements? Why not simply choose to do nothing? Wouldn't that be a lot easier?   To me it seems that the philosophical position of transgenderism is self-defeating, because it tries to redefine gender by trying to change into already-existing definitions of gender. One believes he is a woman. Yet in most cases he doesn't have any of the physical characteristics of the common-sense definition of ""woman."" So he seeks surgery or hormones to acquire some of these physical characteristics to match what he feels in his mind. Some get surgery, some more surgery, some no surgery. All of these are self-ascribed ""women,"" though their physical make-ups may be completely contradictory to one another. One has hormone-induced breasts (or implants), one does not. one has a surgically constructed vagina, one does not. Yet, these are all self-ascribed women. Thus, the definition of ""woman"" ultimately is what one feels. Yet ironically, those who feel like a woman go to great lengths to make physical changes that by their own definition do not define ""woman."" Why do the physical characteristics matter to transgenders if a woman is defined by the fact that she ""feels"" that she is a woman?  So even settings God's Word and even nature itself aside, which defines what is man and what is woman, I don't see how transgenderism even works philosophically."

A trans is attempting to change into something physically that they never were. So this would be comparing apples to oranges.

Moreover, there are many other physical traits of men besides particular genitalia. Completely different muscular structure, skin and hair composition, facial structure, just to name a few."

I am a woman first, and want a female body second.   Yet, others go to further lengths by having surgery to become more woman-like. Are they any more woman than you are? If not, why do they desire surgery when you feel that estrogen supplements are sufficient?   It's not that I don't want female genitals and the like. It's that, for me, the costs and risks outweigh the benefits. If I could snap my fingers and have a fully functioning female reproductive system, I absolutely would.   But if that is the case, if I am defined by what I feel, then why are those who feel attracted to have sex with children or rape women wrong?   A person who feels they are sexually attracted to children is a pedophile; what they feel here does define what they are. That's quite a separate question from whether or not it is right (i.e., moral), and of course I would say that child molestation is wrong. But I would say so, I suspect, for different reasons than you would. I say it is wrong because it does demonstrable harm to the child involved, and my feelings about rape are similar.   Who's to say that their feelings are any less right then yours?   Their feelings, per se, are no less valid. But they cannot act on those feelings because to do so would harm others.   But in this case, they already had the physical characteristics of a man. A trans is attempting to change into something physically that they never were. So this would be comparing apples to oranges.   I disagree. What you are is what you are, and has little bearing on what you were.   Moreover, there are many other physical traits of men besides particular genitalia. Completely different muscular structure, skin and hair composition, facial structure, just to name a few.    This is true, mostly, but almost everything there is hormone-controlled. I've lost all male-pattern muscle mass, my skin is soft and dry, my body hair is withering away, my face has changed shape, etc. These aren't traits that are inaccessible to trans folk."
Christians,3176ql,KarateCowboy,2,Fri Apr 3 00:52:36 2015 UTC,"But if that is the case, if I am defined by what I feel, then why are those who feel attracted to have sex with children or rape women wrong? Who's to say that their feelings are any less right then yours?    You can't seriously be suggesting that raping women and children is equivalent to getting treatment for gender dysphoria, can you?"
Christians,3176ql,Chel_of_the_sea,1 point,Thu Apr 2 20:48:15 2015 UTC,I think they are making the case that strong feelings are not an excellent tool for determining the correct course of action.  I do not think they are suggesting the equivalence you proposed.

It's because they know that big muscles and facial hair are inherently masculine, whereas physical traits like breasts and vaginas are inherently feminine, therefore they desire them."

Christians,31234q,Craigellachie,1 point,Wed Apr 1 15:44:46 2015 UTC,"Nice article, thanks for sharing it. I would like to give an example of the depravity of this business. Before presenting this example I will warn you first of the level of depravity and absurdity. But keep in mind that this was actually venerated.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Prepuce   At various points in history, a number of churches in Europe have claimed to possess Jesus' foreskin, sometimes at the same time. Various miraculous powers have been ascribed to it.   http://hoaxes.org/archive/permalink/the_holy_foreskin   The Holy Foreskin first made an appearance in medieval Europe around 800 ad, when King Charlemagne presented it as a gift to Pope Leo III. Charlemagne said it had been given to him by an angel.  However, rival foreskins soon began to pop up all over Europe. All told, twenty-one different churches claimed to have the Holy Foreskin, often at the same time. Various miraculous powers were attributed to these foreskins. In particular, they were supposed to be able to protect women during childbirth.  Given the glut of Holy Foreskins, churches made efforts to have their foreskin authenticated by Church leaders as the sole genuine article. In the early 12th century, the monks of San Giovanni in Laterano, Rome asked Pope Innocent III to rule on the authenticity of their foreskin, but he declined to do so. Later, the monks of Charroux claimed their foreskin to be the only real one, pointing out that it apparently yielded drops of blood. This convinced Pope Clement VII (1523-1534) who declared theirs to be the authentic thing.  Some medieval theologians argued that all the Holy Foreskins necessarily had to be frauds since the actual Holy Foreskin had, they asserted, ascended into Heaven with Christ. The 17th century theologian Leo Allatius speculated in his essay De Praeputio Domini Nostri Jesu Christi Diatriba that the holy foreskin had ascended into heaven at the same time as Jesus, and had become the rings of Saturn.   http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/01/29/who-stole-john-paul-s-blood-and-christ-s-foreskin.html   The foreskin of Christ is perhaps the most controversial missing relic after it disappeared in 1983 under mysterious circumstances. Until then, it had been encased in a gilded box and paraded through the village of Calcata, north of Rome, in an annual procession marking the annual day of circumcision. It was purported to be the only piece of Christ’s body on earth. Those who made a pilgrimage to pray to the relic were given a 10-year indulgence. The practice was altered in 1900 when anyone who dared mention the holy foreskin—except during the feast day on which it was honored and put on display—was subject to excommunication. The practice of parading the prepuce once a year continued until it disappeared in 1983. Conventional wisdom was that the foreskin found its way to the Vatican, either taken there by the priest of Calcata or snatched in secret. The fear, according to David Farley, who wrote the book An Irreverent Curiosity: In Search of the Church’s Strangest Relic in Italy’s Oldest Town, was that scientists might attempt to clone Christ from the tiny flap of flesh."

Yes pride would be the mother of all sins, because pride makes us want to be our own God, which violates the first commandment- there shall be no God besides ""I am who I am""/ YAHWEH.   Thank you for sharing this piece, :)"
Christians,30xogx,theRoadLessTraveled1,2,Tue Mar 31 17:13:12 2015 UTC,"In Aquinas' hierarchy of sins Pride is kind of like sin 0 of the 7 deadly sins. It's an orientation towards ourselves and away from God. It's distinguished from mere vanity, or being egotistical. Pride is the choice to follow the path away from subservience to God. It's well understood the chief sin."
Christians,30xogx,faintpremonition,2,Wed Apr 1 04:31:00 2015 UTC,"This is such an important point.  When I hear nonbelievers say, ""how could a JUST God do such and such"", I immediately think of pride. The human is basically saying, ""I am the judge of what is right and wrong.. bring God before me and I will make a ruling  if he is just"".. Wow.   Pride is a cornerstone of today's society. Pride is the foundation on which humanism is founded. When I see a person asking for ""evidence"" of God, what they are saying is, ""I am the arbiter of what is true and what is false. Bring your facts and theories before me and I with my mind, and my intellect and my reason, I will determine what is true and what is false"".. Asking for ""scientific proof"" for example is a form of pride. Its saying, ""Man has all the tools and insight he needs to determine what is real and true and what is not... Bring the evidence before me and I will make a determination""... It is a direct violation of the first commandment, ""Thou Shalt Have No other Gods before me"".   Democracy itself is a blatant form of pride. It is founded on the theory that ""we the people"" know what is best.. we will determine what is law, and what is not. We will decide who is charge. We will do as we please (provided we take a vote on its first). It is rooted in pride. Notice even in the Bible there is never an instance of the disciples taking a vote on anything. When it was time to replace Judas with another apostle, they did not vote on it. They understood that they were incapable of making that decision. They prayed and drew straws.. I kind of think we may need to get back to that in modern times, in some circumstances.  The Bible is our source of wisdom and all knowledge. Any ""reality"" that conflicts with the Bible can only be considered erroneous at best, and deceitful and evil at worst.   This concept of pride is a difficult one to accept as sin. It goes against our very BEING. When you come to truly appreciate what Pride is, only then can we begin to understand how woefully sinful and wicked our nature is, without Christ and and the Holy Spirit. It becomes easier and easier to understand that it is impossible for us to come to God on our own.. he must reveal himself to us, for there to be any hope at all."
Christians,30xogx,Bman409,2,Mon Apr 6 18:29:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, I agree.  You may enjoy Tim Keller's series on Proverbs. The thing that I remember the most about it, is that Wisdom is understanding how reality actually works, and that a lot of that is doing the opposite of what worldly advice would have you do.  Actual Wisdom is one way to defeat Pride."

I have been discovering this quite a bit lately in my meditations, etc. The world says, ""buy low, sell high"", the Bible says if a man takes your coat, give him your shirt as well (hardly a viable business model!).. the word says, ""you only live once"", while the Bible says you only die once.. and then face the judgement. The word says, ""I will take my revenge"", the Bible says turn the other cheek... The world says, ""show me the proof"", the Bible says without faith it is impossible to please God.  a guy could probably write a whole book comparing and contrasting the world with the Word.  (maybe I'll write a sermon on that, calling it ""the World Versus the Word!"""

Even if Jesus died for your sins, it is insulting to his sacrifice if we continue in unrepentant sin.

[Romans 6:15-18] (Actually read all of Romans 6.) I get that people are still sinful, but we must continue in faith, continue in repentance, and don't indulge in sin. As long as you keep sinning, keep repenting.  As for God's foreknowledge, that argument gets really confusing really fast. Search about ""Molinism"", because I am a Molinist and I believe that God's so-called ""Middle Knowledge"" of what everyone freely chooses to do is actually caused by the free choices themselves, and it's not that God's knowledge causes people to act in a certain way. Anyway it's confusing and I don't really have time to get into it."

[28] Anyone who has set aside the law of Moses dies without mercy on the evidence of two or three witnesses. [29] How much worse punishment, do you think, will be deserved by the one who has trampled underfoot the Son of God, and has profaned the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has outraged the Spirit of grace?

Romans 6:15-18 | English Standard Version (ESV)   Slaves to Righteousness [15] What then? Are we to sin because we are not under law but under grace? By no means! [16] Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness?

For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved."" (Romans 10:9-10 ESV) So if a professing Christian doesn't follow Christ by faith, he will go to hell just as the atheist. In fact Christ warned of this when He said, ""    On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?’ And then will I declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.’""(Matthew 7:22-23 ESV)"

Something about the churches that I am part of or doctrinal aligned the past few years,are churches that are small (~150 people) and mostly middle aged folks, but the church is very Biblical oriented. Scripture says not many people want to follow the narrow path and truly follow His teachings, and many would want to hear things that tickle their ears.  Scripture says:   Matthew 7:13-14  13 “Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. 14 But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it.  I have visited those big churches(~1,000- 5,000 people) that have more young adults, but they are seeker friendly churches and some of them are little prosperity oriented, and too watered down for me. I couldn't ""betray"" Jesus for that..hahahaha acting upon on my agenda.  My close ladies friends are about late 40s to 50ish  , most of their children are either younger than me or married.  Yes I have revealed this ""nudge"" in my heart to these 4 precious seasoned and mature ladies, and they have been praying for me.  Sadly, I don't have any close friend my age :( I didn't mean to come off prideful or anything when I said such, I find many people my age around me don't see the same thing I do.  I tried Christian dating site before, and quite honest the people that sign up there are no difference than any secular dating sites, it could be I didn't meet the right kinds at the time. Or maybe there was no chemistry between the dates and I?I am not sure. So, right now I would like to leave it to the Lord.   I am little exhausted and have lost some hope in finding him. It really is like finding a needle in haystack. I don't think I am picky, the fundamental requirement would be he needs to have a personal relationship with Jesus and being intellectually curious.   I mushed up my gut in composing that prayer request, who knows maybe there is another Godly single man here on Christians sub that feels the same way? hahaha lol :) I am open for what God wants to do.   EDIT: By the way, I have prayed and seek the Lord if it is His will for me in ministries, because I am convinced there is no job in the world that is more valuable than teaching God's words.

All our lives we are taught not to help people sin, it makes sense. Why would you lend a helping hand to help your friend lie about something, or to help him cheat on a test? Heck, would you sell a gun to a guy planning to go shoot people? Of course not, because you wouldn't dare aid in an act of sin.  Serving a gay couple at your local diner isn't aiding them in sin. Taking money and photographing their wedding as a means of helping them celebrate their gay marriage and gay intimacy is."
Christians,30t2p9,pubmadison,2,Tue Mar 31 16:04:21 2015 UTC,"I understand that. That would be the reason I do not do divorce law, because for the vast majority it is aiding in their sin.

(Also, you should really read up on what orthodox Christianity actually means, because you apparently have no idea.)  The general feel that I'm getting from this sub is not one of a place to ""respectfully voice questions and opinions"" (as it says in the sidebar), but one of silencing anything that the mods see as different from their own.  If this is a sub for Christians, then it should be a sub where Christians are allowed to share. Time and time again, the message that I'm getting here is that the mods only see Fundamentalist Baptists as Christians, and if that's the case, then we're about to have some issues.  Or maybe I'm confusing my subs - maybe I just THOUGHT this was /r/Christians, and this whole time I've really been in /r/Baptists."

She is clearly living a life of willful unrepentant sin. It makes me wonder what her purposes are in pursuing you.

Personally as a former youth pastor I now counsel young guys not to get in a relationship until they are able to mature more in their own faith and their own life.  Where are you with God?  However deep you are with God you will pursue a woman that reflect that.  Don't just look for someone just to check the minimal box of ""oh, she's Christian."" What her drinking and marijuana tells me also is that she's probably driven by her whims and desire.  The issue of self-control is going to be big in a Christian relationship as it can make or break both Christians purity.  I would even counsel not being with her if your walk with God and your loving obedience to the Lord in terms of Holiness means anything.

The decided that  comparing distributing leaflets opposing the draft was not the same thing as maliciously shouting fire in a theater, and that the leaflets were okay, and shouting fire, as ever, is not.

He was found guilty of only one of the “homophobic” charges. Overd, 50, was fined $300 and ordered to pay compensation and costs totaling $1,800 at Bristol Crown Court. “I have been ordered to pay compensation for causing ‘emotional pain’ to someone who approached me aggressively demanding to debate the issue,” said Overd. “There was no harm, injury or theft, just a simple disagreement over theology which I have now been fined for.”  District Judge Shamim Ahmed Qureshi told Overd he should not have referenced Leviticus chapter 20 in explaining the biblical view on homosexuality, but “clearly indicated that he could have used chapter 18 of the book,” reported Christian Concern.  Overd agreed he used Leviticus 20 in his comments but never referenced the death penalty.  “I am being punished for words that never passed my lips,” he said. Overd, who initially told the judge he would not pay the fine but relented when threatened with 45 days in jail, took particular issue with Qureshi dictating which passages from the Bible were lawful for him to use.  “I am amazed that the judge sees it as his role to dictate which parts of the Bible can and can’t be preached,” he said.  “I did not quote the full text of Leviticus 20 or make reference to the death penalty, but the judge is telling me that I should use other parts of the Bible.

They made no more stop till they had carried me through the main street, from one end of the town to the other. I continued speaking all the time to those within hearing, feeling no pain or weariness. at the west end of the town, seeing a door half open, I made toward it and would have gone in; but a gentleman in the shop would not suffer me, saying they would pull the house down to the ground. However, I stood at the door, and asked, “Are you willing to hear me speak?” Many cried out, “No, no! knock his brains out; down with him; kill him at once.”Others said, “Nay, but we will hear him first.” I began asking, “What evil have I done? Which of you all have I wronged in word or deed?” And continued speaking for above a quarter of an hour, till my voice suddenly failed: then the floods began to lift up their voice again; many crying out, “Bring him away! bring him away! ...Such incidents were by no means isolated in the early years of Methodism.”"

Christians,30fnl5,VeritasDomain,3,Fri Mar 27 04:46:27 2015 UTC,"As a pastor I feel you. One of the key for myself to remember is that ministry burn out is a spiritual problem.  When I finally understood that, addressing the problem is more long term rather than a mere band aid. I think the best you can do is train a few other guys to do it.  Perspective is important: Don't train others just for the sake of taking a break, but do so in order to get the church serving!  Do it to pour into people's lives--see it as an opportunity for discipleship.  Even something like AV is spiritual, and even share with others your motivation and spiritual motives for what you do. As you think about the spiritual reason for what you do, it also encourages one to keep on serving the Lord.  Being reminded of the big picture of what you do helps one be freshed in the Lord. I must also add that when one takes a break, don't see ""break"" as being away from the church on Sunday.  Even when you are not doing AV that week you are taking a break, go to Church and double the effort to be still and be fed for one's Soul from undistracted songs of worship and hearing the Sermon!  True rest is in Him! I hope that helps."

Train them also so that your church has a second/backup AV guy.  Perhaps also look for an assistant who can help you every week. That way you can shift your focus to a couple things, and not 5. They could do the slides during the sermon. It doesn't need to be all on you!  Edit: Also, think about asking the worship director for help. It would be beneficial for him/her too."

Christians,300z0w,VeritasDomain,2,Tue Mar 24 13:15:48 2015 UTC,"Before I give a longer answer, I have a couple of prequisite questions. Are you an elder of your church? Are either of the two girls we are discussing ""official"" members of your church?"
Christians,300z0w,mwerte,3,Mon Mar 23 17:12:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not an elder. The two girls are not church members, yet. The saved one does want to be baptized and join. Both girls attend church and youth group. They each have a sister that attend too....Neither girl's parents attend, nor are the parents church members."
Christians,300z0w,VeritasDomain,7,Mon Mar 23 17:26:52 2015 UTC,"Ok thanks for answering those questions.  This is a hard situation emotionally, I'm sure, but I think Scripture does give clarity on this.  First, let me address the girl who professes to be a Christian.   Because you are not an elder, if we look to Matthew 18, your role looks like this: First you confront the person. If they do not repent, then bring another witness with you and confront the person again. If they still don't repent, then you report it ""to the church"" which in this case would mean one or more of elders. But there are at least two challenges here. One, the girl has not been ""officially"" received into the membership of the church, so she can not be church disciplined in the formal sense. Two, you've already reported this to an elder who apparently does not have the strength to really take action. Are there any other elders you could bring this up to? Or is this church under what is called an ""autocracy,"" where one man serves as the elder and makes all the decisions? If the former, I'd speak about this to another elder. If the latter, then perhaps you might consider asking the pastor for more decisiveness. This really is a very serious issue.  In a healthy church setting, this would be dealt with by confronting the professing Christian about her sin, showing her the Scriptures that clearly state that openly unrepentant sinners will not inherit the kingdom of God, and that therefore not only can she not be received into church membership, but her very soul is in grave danger. So in her case, my advice would be to follow Matthew 18 as far as you can. The most important thing I think you can do (if you haven't already), is to clearly and gently confront the girl with the truth, not only telling her that she is in sin, but also the consequences of not repenting. This goes for any professing Christian who is openly defying the commandments of Christ, which is not the same as someone who is struggling with a sin, but genuinely fighting to stop. This may or may not be the case with the others you were mentioning. If the church receives her into membership, then you have an even more serious dilemma on your hands.  For those that do not profess to be Christians, you should simply continue to lovingly speak the full truth of Scripture to them. Faith comes by hearing the word (Romans 10), and they will either be convicted through the Holy Spirit, or they will likely become uncomfortable with your message and leave.   Also, since you do have authority in keeping your students safe, both spiritually and physically, you should dictate appropriate behavior in your class. I would separate the two girls. No physical interaction between them. This will hopefully give them some sense of how serious you are about this issue, and it is for their own spiritual good. Also keep in mind that they are setting a bad example for your other students, so it is for their own good as well. Remember what Paul said, ""Bad company corrupts good morals,"" so you should not only focus on these two girls, but on how everyone affects everyone else, for good or for bad.  Anyway, hopefully this makes some sense and helps a little, and please feel free to ask followup questions.   Edit: And I forgot the most important thing. Continue to pray about this!"
Christians,300z0w,VeritasDomain,3,Mon Mar 23 18:12:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks brother. This is solid advice. In discussing this issue with you all, its becoming clear to me that our church is lacking in formal administrative bodies, especially in dealing with spirit matters. This is probably a greater problem then what is happening in the youth group. Its time we addressed this within the church and corrected this deficiency.   all of these teachings in the scriptures (Paul, Christ, Peter, etc) are perfectly laid out for the proper functioning of the body of Christ. When something is neglected (like proper functioning deacons, elders, etc) the effect is serious and noticeable, even if we thought at the time that it was no big deal."
Christians,300z0w,newBreed,2,Mon Mar 23 18:36:33 2015 UTC,"Not an easy situation.  I don't have any immediate answers and I'm going to ask other older men around me. It sounds to me it might be wise to have others be with you.  Other than the Pastor, is there other group of men who are leaders as well?  Are there ruling Elders, a Board, Deacon's meeting at your church where others can be involved?  I bring this up because sometimes involving those in the immediate church goes further than an answer on Reddit. (That's not to take away from you writing this nor the fact that sometimes there are great answers). I do think there is a place for 1 Corinthians 5 as the nearest analogy to be applicable to the circumstances you are in.  I think that passage does reinforce the role of confronting this head on and also discipline when it comes down to it. As a Pastor who use to be involved with youth ministry I feel the weight of your concern as a shepherd.  If it is any encouragement, I am glad to see you reporting that you have talked to them about this.  I am also glad that they have also shared with you what is on their mind."
Christians,300z0w,VeritasDomain,3,Mon Mar 23 17:55:43 2015 UTC,"I have another man that helps me part time with the Youth Group. He's a godly man and we have had some conversations about this. Our church is a Baptist Church. Its very small. The ""Board"" is more along the lines of what most churches would call ""trustees"". They concern themselves with managing the funds and the building, etc.. .The ""deacons"" and pastor oversee the spiritual side of things. The deacons are mostly women at this point.. again, this isn't ideal and the Pastor and I have discussed it being a problem. That said, there aren't enough men willing to lead. A sad commentary. There is a solid core of believers in the church, however, I do not feel a call to look elsewhere. We're officially an American Baptist Association church but functionally, we're rather independent. The pastor and most of us are conservative in our christian viewpoint, I'd say."

Other times they are more introspective about the future and what God might have planned for them. Other times they have cried and said that I don't understand them.   Standard. Teenage girls (and guys for that matter) change their mind, especially about relationships every few days it seems.  Keep the girls in the youth group. Preach the gospel. Pray for them. Don't be the pastor that kicks sinners out of the place that they desperately need to be. You lose a couple kids...it hurts for sure. I think in your situation it has opened a door to ask the parents of the kids who cannot come anymore if you could meet with them and talk it through. Perfect opportunity to share the gospel.  My first step would be to put a ban on all forms of PDA at youth group functions whether the couple is bisexual or straight. No PDA from any couples.   Then with someone else present (never counsel the opposite sex alone when the discussion is sex and dating) counsel the girl who claims that she follows Jesus. It's a good discipleship opportunity."

Christians,2zkcds,sobecreation,3,Sat Mar 21 23:57:04 2015 UTC,"24 Stop judging by mere appearances, but instead judge correctly.” (John 7:24, NIV)    Judging is a part of life. So is discrimination. Unfortunately, these words have negative connotations these days. When we say ""don't discriminate,"" what we mean to say is ""don't discriminate -- ILLEGALLY"".   Employers can (and must) make judgement calls on who they can choose to employ, but they cannot discriminate (legally) based on race, creed, sex, age, national origin, etc.   The same thing holds true for life in general. We have to make judgement choices every day. What we should not do is ""pre-judge"" or judge a person or a situation without any prior knowledge of it (where we get the idea of ""prejudice""). Prejudice is ALWAYS a bad thing.   In short...we cannot avoid ""judging"". But what we can do is judge, as Jesus said, with a right judgement. Any right judgement MUST be based in God's eternal, unchanging Word. It is above culture, race, creed, and even religion.   We know when God judges a matter, it is always a right judgement. When we judge, if we don't discern a matter in accordance with God's Word, then we will never judge rightly. But if we encounter a person or a situation, in the light of the Word of God, we will always judge wisely and correctly."

I realized if I prayed for everyone and everything those two groups requested, in addition to my own prayers for my family, prayer could easily be my full time job.   It's also uncomfortable to me when someone says something like please pray for ""my three friends who all need jobs.""

There were plenty of evolutionary scientists to choose from during his time, including Darwin himself, but Einstein chose creationists over Darwin.

I used to be quite wary of the early church as in my head I saw it as ""Catholic"". But I have read so many writings that contradict the teachings of Rome and the East which goes against their claim of the early church being theirs.

Jesus walked up to his disciples and without discussing it with them or helping them with the task they were doing, he told them to ""follow me"". He didn't earn any rights when he came, because he already had all the rights. Since we're the heir of Christ, he gave us that gift of not having to work our way to sharing the gospel. He's done the work, and all we have to do is share it.

Christians,2ypw1p,mlbontbs87,4,Wed Mar 11 23:20:54 2015 UTC,"Hmm. There seems to be some confusion over this statue. This source seems to show that there are two statues close to each other, one which pertains to what you described, and another one that is titled ""Faith that Wins Idolatry."" The bits about Mary, the angel, and heaven may all be inaccurate. Wikipedia does not mention Mary, and ascribes the names of Luther and Zwingli to the two men. The book is alleged to be a work of Zwingli. So, I'm not sure honestly. Most of the sources I can find, like this one, agree with my original title:   To the right of the altar sits Pietro Le Gros'sculpture entitled The Triumph of Faith over Heresy.  This sculpture depicts Mary casting Martin Luther and his precursor, Jan Huss, out of heaven.  An attendant angel rips their translations of the Bible and their writings to shreds.  The militant nature of the Jesuits and their mission to spread the faith and reassert the power of the church is clear in this dramatic work.  A companion sculpture entitled “The Triumph of Faith over Idolatry” by Jean-Baptiste Theodon further cements the message of the Jesuits.   Also here. Here. And here."

Christians,2ygr9x,Zephyr101,5,Mon Mar 9 18:12:17 2015 UTC,"Hi Israel. I want you to know that you're not alone in what you're going through. It's not unusual for us to experience these types of emotions in the christian life, especially if you really are one and not just playing at being a christian. Jesus called for those who hunger and thirst for righteousness. Not only those who seek righteousness in the world, but righteousness in our personal lives too.   Jesus is also known as a man of sorrows/suffering, and in becoming more like Jesus we become people who experience that sorrow too - both externally and internally. So it's not necessarily a bad thing that you are experiencing these emotions, it's part of the territory and actually a good sign you're on the right path.  That being said, self hatred is also just another form of pride. You do not live up to your own expectations/standards and you beat yourself up over not living up to them. In your own mind you are better than your actual actions, when you really need to face the reality that who you really are is found only in your actions. You are not what you think or the judgements you make, or the knowledge you have - you are what you do.  On one hand that's absolutely devastating because we like to hide behind the fact that we are positionally new creatures in christ, but in practice, in actuality, we're still dirty sinners. Paul expresses the grief that comes from this juxtaposition in Romans 7. The reason I tell you this is because we have to work at killing our egos which tell us how great we are because we have found the truth in christ and it's a hard lesson to learn. God doesn't let up at all in this lesson - it's something we have to be taught continually - that we are sinners in need of a graceful God. That lesson never goes away. There are infinite fresh ways God teaches us, and they're painful lessons, but there is mercy in them because they keep us humble and empathizing with the lost.  I would suggest you read Tozer's comments on Rutherford talking about God's hammer, file and furnace. You can find it here. I'll pray for you Israel, God bless."

That is where we apply the Scripture's instructions about self-control, living for others instead of self, and in the case of masturbation, sexual pleasure in the biblical context of marriage, which is a co-mutual giving of pleasure to the other. Masturbation fails in all of those categories, and thus clearly falls outside of God's will."
Christians,2ygr9x,WarLorax,0,Tue Mar 10 15:37:16 2015 UTC,"I would disagree with you on most points.  If self-pleasure is outside God's will, then in addition to masturbation and marijuana, so too would be alcohol, tobacco, really good food, running (give's a runner's high), massage, and so on.  I don't disagree that we are called to ""love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control,"" but I would disagree with your interpretation of how these fruits work out in daily life.  I think OP is coming from a tradition similar to yours, which is why he is racked with guilt.  Look at how many of the fruits of the Spirit are relational, dealing with how we deal with others."

Yes, and any of those things, if done for the service and pleasure of self, would be wrong.  I agree with you that this is a very difficult issue, but the answer is not to give in to the temptation to masturbate. The answer is to resist the flesh, pursue holiness, and trust Christ."

The christian walk is a journey. Its not a ""destination"" that you reach and then you're fine. Every day is a new challenge. Paul talks about running a race to the end. The end is the end of our lives.. up to that point, every day is another lap in the race. Continue to cry out to God telling him your sins, asking for his transforming power.. That kind of thing can only come from the Lord. I think you should read and reread and reread the Book of Romans. This is a book that deals alot with what you're talking about. That's the theological answer to what you need... from a practical point of view, I do believe that it helps to be very careful what we put in to our minds (and see with our eyes). Matthew 6:22 says, """"The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are healthy, your whole body will be full of light.""    be careful what you allow your eyes to see.. Pornography is particularly harmful this way. I was never ""in"" to porn in a big way but like anyone, I've seen some of it.. particularly on the internet... There are images that I saw probably 10 years ago that are still as clear as day in my mind. Just like a song that you learned as a kid and can still sing today, those visual images get in to your brain and somehow they are lodged in there for a long long time... Guard your eyes.. and your ears for that matter.... There is so much in the media, on the net, everywhere you turn someone is trying to sell you a message about sex.. For a 16, 17 year old guy, its overwhelming... You don't stand a chance, bro... The only answer is to try to avoid exposure to that stuff, and to pray that God will ""lead you not in to temptation"".. but it does no good to pray that prayer if you're still going to ""walk close to the edge"" of the cliff and flirt with temptation... Be transformed by the renewing of your mind! Replace the music that you listen to with christian music.. there's a ton of great stuff out there for every genre.. its not like when I was a kid and we didn't have the music available like you guys do today...anyway, whatever the case, no matter how many times you fall, God's forgiveness and mercy is WAY greater... .Peter asked Jesus how many times we should forgive each other?? Seven? Jesus said, ""Seventy TIMES seven""...(and that was talking about ""each day"").. so the point is, God will always forgive sin if you ask forgiveness in sincerity... Talk to God constantly. I used to ask God to accept my body as a ""living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to him"" when I felt temptation coming on... Literally pray that prayer in your mind.... James says, ""resist the devil, and he will flee from you""... at some point, you have to make up your mind and say, ""look.. this is what I believe, and while I can never ""prove"" it to satisfy my mortal mind, etc.. I am going to go with faith and trust God... The Bible says ""without faith it is impossible to please God"".. I personally think that's the reason that everything isn't revealed to us... because then believing would be a matter of choice.. we would take pride in ourselves and say, ""it is my mind, and my reason"" that saved me... instead of faith.... I know this is kind of rambling but I felt I had to respond... whatever the case, God isn't done with you yet.. he has a lifetime ahead for you... In Paul's final letter to a young man not much older than you (2 Timothy 1:12), he says, ""....I know whom I have believed, and am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him until that day. "". God is able to guard what you have entrusted to him (your salvation)..... Jeremiah 29:11 ""For I know the plans I have for you,"" declares the LORD, ""plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.""  Thats the hope... press on toward the mark and even if you give up, be aware that God won't give up .. Like the father of the prodigal son, he will be out there looking each day, to see if you're there on the horizon, making your way back ""home"" to your Father's house.... and when you do, he'll have a royal robe waiting..  I pray you find peace my brother, and I'm sure you will"

A little friendly jab is okay here and there; and I think it can be good for rapport, but when it becomes too central, it weakens one's argument and fails to convey the love and sober-mindedness of Christ."
Christians,2y3tkm,B4ptist,6,Fri Mar 6 04:39:17 2015 UTC,"Reading your post reminded me a lot of myself, and I think I can help.   I've asked Jesus into my heart so many times at this point, I a lot of the time don't know if i'm saved or not.    You need to stop viewing your relationship with God as you saving yourself, and  begin viewing it as God saving you.  Titus 3:5 Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy HE SAVED US, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;  Titus 3:6 Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;  Titus 3:7 That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.    We are saved by Christ's obedience, not our own. (Romans 5:19) What you could not do (Romans 3:20), Christ did on your behalf. (Hebrews 1:3, 9:12, 10:14)  It's clear you fear God which is evidence that you have been regenerated by Holy Spirit. (The unregenerate man does not fear God-Romans 3:18)    If you believe the testimony of 1 Cor 15:3-4, then you should have assurance because Jesus said in John 6:47, ""Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.""  Rather than obeying God to get saved (which Christ already did for you), obey God out of love and obedience to Him.  I'll keep you in my prayers! :-)"
Christians,2y3tkm,Dying_Daily,3,Fri Mar 6 07:42:25 2015 UTC,"This is great advice. I would only add to that to specifically pray to God for strengthening and assurance of faith. I pray for this almost every day, and often multiple times per day."
Christians,2y3tkm,B4ptist,2,Fri Mar 6 15:11:03 2015 UTC,"Glad you added that.  Luther said, ""To be a Christian without prayer is no more possible than to be alive without breathing."""
Christians,2y3tkm,ProtestantShoeString,5,Fri Mar 6 15:45:40 2015 UTC,"Everyone has a problem with escaping sins of some kind. You are certainly not alone! Sins are pleasing to us (the flesh part) otherwise we wouldn't do them and the cycle would be no big deal to break. I know it can be horribly disheartening after you realize you have fallen back into a sin but God is so amazingly awesome that his forgiveness can cover you.   Also kudos to you for not giving up! In any kind of problem you face there are many ways to overcome them but some work better than others. I don't know what methods you have been using to resist the sin but maybe there are some you haven't taken advantage of? I would recommend talking to a kind friend, pastor, or parent. It can be scary but chances are they went/are going through it too, they love you, and do want to help.  I think the emotional pain you are going through is proof that you are not far from him at all. I had similar thoughts in the past and when I look back, it seems those were the times He was holding me closest. I don't know if I can actually explain it but... Inwardly I felt like a screaming little child who had just broken a leg. The pain won't go away instantly but God picked me up and comforted me while He gradually healed it even if all I could focus on at the time was the pain.   Edit: I also want to mention that (unfortunately) some Christians ignore their sin or try to find ways to justify it. By facing and struggling against your sin you aren't falling into that trap. You are doing exactly what we are called to do when we commit to being Christians through baptism (or whatever your particular denomination does/ calls it) by dying to our fleshly self. In my experience that self just doesn't die quickly or easily."
Christians,2y3tkm,Eagle9183,4,Fri Mar 6 05:30:35 2015 UTC,Your frustration sounds like Paul's in Romans 7:17-25.
Christians,2y3tkm,ironshadowspider,3,Fri Mar 6 05:33:52 2015 UTC,"Amen. Your frustration and nigh despair echo Paul's cry, ""What a wretched man I am! Who will set me free from this body of death!?"". The next verses also provide the remedy: look away from your sin, and to Christ, who IS your righteousness.  [Romans 7:17-25]  [Romans 8:1-4]"
Christians,2y3tkm,VerseBot,2,Fri Mar 6 05:48:37 2015 UTC,"Romans 7:17-25 | English Standard Version (ESV)   [17] So now it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me. [18] For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh. For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out. [19] For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing. [20] Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me. [21] So I find it to be a law that when I want to do right, evil lies close at hand. [22] For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being, [23] but I see in my members another law waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members. [24] Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? [25] Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin.    Romans 8:1-4 | English Standard Version (ESV)   Life in the Spirit [1] There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. [2] For the law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death. [3] For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do. By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh, [4] in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.

Christians,2y3tkm,ruizbujc,3,Fri Mar 6 05:42:42 2015 UTC,"It seems like God has led you to all the right conclusions; the problem is that you've had some bad theology ingrained in your head that refuses to let you accept the truth of the Gospel :)  Let's explore...   I am a miserable failure.   This is absolutely true.  That is the natural state of all humans.  God expects you to be a failure.  The whole message of grace isn't that God stops you from being a failure - it's that he loves you even while you're a failure!  Because of this, you don't need to worry about whether or not you fail.  It doesn't matter.  Per 1 John 4:18, God isn't mad at you when you sin.  There's no punishment for Christians when we sin.  All of God's wrath against your sin was laid on Christ 2000 years ago.  There's this false belief that God has 2 wraths - one against general sin that was put on Christ and one against individual sin that God retains against us.  Just ""saying that out loud"" should show how silly and unscriptural the idea is, but if you need more backing, let me know.   whether I hate myself for it or if I really enjoyed sinning   God expects you to enjoy sin.  That doesn't mean you should sin just to experience that enjoyment, but it also means that you're normal if you enjoy sin - not abnormal.  Sin wouldn't have any power if it wasn't enjoyable.  Accordingly, God expects this.   which leads to me feeling like i've reconciled with God, and then I sin again   Yep, normal part of the process.  I think what might help you is to realize that you never stopped sinning to begin with.  Of course, you may have postponed one particular sin, but our whole lives are drenched in sin all the time.  I can't think of a single second of my day where I'm not sinning in some capacity.  When we do good, it is the Spirit working through our sinful bodies that does it - for He is the only one capable of doing anything good.  At the same time, when we do ""bad,"" it is not attributed against you - only against your body (Romans 7:17).  That is why God will give you a glorified (i.e. sinless) body when you enter into His presence.   It's a brutal cycle, and I need out   This is part of where the ""bad theology"" comes into play.  You won't get out until heaven.  But that's okay!  You don't have to feel guilty about living in a cycle that God knows you can't escape while bound to an earthly body.  That doesn't mean you start sinning intentionally (Romans 6:1-2); but it does mean that you don't have to feel guilty about sin when it happens (Romans 8:1, 1 Cor. 10:23).  Paul even acknowledged in Philippians 1:21-26 that it's better to die and escape this cycle to be with Christ, but that if we did that, who would lead people out on earth?  The path leads out of the woods - it's not actually being out.  You have to be on the path with someone to lead them along it.   I really just wanna give up, and stop trying   That's exactly right.  You can't stop sinning - so stop trying.  The message of the Gospel is that Jesus does the work for us.  No amount of will power, accountability partners, internet filters, therapy, or anything else can stop you from sinning.  That job is reserved for the Holy Spirit through Jesus alone - for the glory of the Father.  So, stop trying to stop sinning.  Instead, focus on growing God's Kingdom.  I think you'll be surprised by how active obedience (i.e. evangelism and discipleship) is far more effective at solving the sin problem than passive obedience (i.e. trying some ""new"" method of avoiding sin).   I've asked Jesus into my heart so many times at this point, I a lot of the time don't know if i'm saved or not   I used to do this.  Then I was taught 1 Peter 3:18.  This verse tells us that Jesus died for all of our sins - even the ones we haven't committed yet.  When we ask for forgiveness the first time, it counts for all time and we never need to be forgiven again.  Out of humility, it is still a good exercise to submit our sins to Christ anyway, but this is not an ongoing ""salvation obligation"" for Christians (unless you're catholic and follow a different line of theology with regard to confession - but that's a massively separate conversation).   Every time I ask him, I feel the same amount of hurting and emptiness and loneliness as before   I feel like Jesus is telling you, ""Why are you hurting?  I hurt so you don't have to.  Are you trying to make my sacrifice meaningless?""  I know it's easier said than done to stop feeling guilty and empty; but if you truly believe the Gospel of Jesus, there should be a mental perception shift that allows you to accept yourself for who you are - a vile, evil sinner - and Jesus for who He is - the one who loves you regardless of who you are - so that you can continue striving to advance God's Kingdom without being bogged down by your flesh.  Likewise, Ezekiel 36:26 says that you've been given a new heart.  Your old heart would have been right to feel guilty - because you were.  But once you have been justified through faith in Jesus Christ, your guilt is gone.  As an attorney, I assure you that you cannot be justified and guilty in a court of law at the same time.  This is why the Bible uses these terms - so that everyone understands this concept.   I know the consequences for that are pretty large   There are earthly consequences of giving into sin (1 Cor. 10:23), but if you are faithless to living as God has called you to live, He will still be faithful to you (2 Timothy 2:13).  So, if I look at porn and masterbate, I might harm my relationship with my wife.  If I lie, I might delude my perception of truth and lose some friends or my job in the process.  If I steal something, I may go to jail.  But none of these things alter my identity in Christ - so long as I haven't risen to the level of disowning Him.  In short, it sounds like God is already telling you everything you need to know - you just have to reconcile the truths you're feeling about yourself with the truth of the Gospel!"
Christians,2y3tkm,SisterEsther,3,Fri Mar 6 07:28:33 2015 UTC,"Have you been praying and supplicating for mercy? His grace covers all sins. I too struggle with feeling ashamed of myself and then going back to Him to repent over and over for something I already repented for. Being trapped in the vicious cycle of hating oneself for sinful behavior, taking your focus off the salvation through grace alone that Christ bestowed upon us, will only cause a chasm between you and our Lord.   When I catch myself in this frame of mind, I try to change the inner dialogue I have with myself - instead of bringing out the whip to beat myself with, I first thank Him for His grace and salvation. I thank Him for His mercy, and express my gratitude and need for His strength when I falter. I believe that refocusing your attentions may help you change these behavioral concerns. It has drawn me nigh unto God, so I hope it may help you as well."

Christians,2y4219,Danishsnow,2,Fri Mar 6 14:42:11 2015 UTC,"The conversation I had was just a brief discussion and couldn't be called a debate (especially since we were both of the same mind).

Also, by ""people to be consistent"" are you talking about the Christian people as a whole or individual people?"
Christians,2y4219,Danishsnow,2,Fri Mar 6 22:51:54 2015 UTC,"Also, by ""people to be consistent"" are you talking about the Christian people as a whole or individual people?   Usually individual people need to be more consistent. This can apply to both a believer or non-believer."
Christians,2y4219,Dying_Daily,4,Fri Mar 6 22:57:57 2015 UTC,"I think the same general biblical guidelines for communicating with others should be applied here as well. I would offer these suggestions, which unfortunately I have had to learn the hard way:   First, speak out of a heart of love for your neighbor, not out of a desire to win an argument for your own glory. Seek the good of the other person, not his defeat. Respect him as a person, as you yourself would want to be respected.  Don't argue. If the conversation seems to be turning into a quarrel, then attempt to be the peacemaker. If you do get angry, apologize and ask for forgiveness. The Bible teaches us to live in peace with everyone if possible. Showing yourself as peaceful and charitable may open the door for further opportunity, but one is less likely to desire dialogue with someone who stubbornly prolongs a quarrel in anger. You don't want to seem combative, but peaceful. I have learned this the hard way. Pray before, during, and after the conversation for yourself and your colleague. Be prepared to defend your position. I find that having prepared arguments helps deter myself from the temptation of frustration when I don't immediately know the answer to a question."

Christians,2y4219,injoy,2,Fri Mar 6 23:01:07 2015 UTC,"I really don't initiate this sort of a conversation because I don't think the scripture gives us enough information.. Was it a literal six days? I don't know.. there's arguments to be made both ways and I know very knowledgeable people who love the Lord that differ in opinion on these things... the areas that I am definitive about are these: God is the omnipotent, omniscient creator of the Universe. God created the Universe out of nothing. There is/was a literal Adam. Adam was created from the dust.. not from another animal. Adam was made in God's image and through Adam, all of mankind fell in to sin. There was a flood that wiped out Adam's line and we're all descended from Noah, his wife, and his son's wives (and possibly the Nephilim mentioned in Genesis 6)  Other than that, its open to debate.  animals do evolve, however, they do not evolve in to new phyla, orders, families, etc. Within a species, there is evolution over time (new breeds of dogs, for example).. This is also called ""adaptation""  God created all the animal life on earth from the ground.   (the plants, however, are interesting. the ""land produced"" the vegetation at God's command in Genesis 1:11-12)  There was no abiogenesis. There is no common ancestor to all life  I don't easily become angry on this sort of issue and even if the other party wants to laugh or insult me, I probably would shrug and say, ""if you don't believe it....believe what you want""..Not everyone who hears the gospel is going to believe it.. My job isn't to convince them.. its to share it  Parable of the Sower (Luke 8)... at some point, you shake the dust off your feet and move on (Matthew 10:14)"
