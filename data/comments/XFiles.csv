XFiles,3e4ohf,YELLHEAH,5,Tue Jul 21 22:50:38 2015 UTC,What I find myself thinking at least once an episode is that it's such a shame they didn't have smartphones with cameras and internet access back then...
XFiles,3e4ohf,MidshipSquirrel,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:54:46 2015 UTC,No kidding! But that would make half of the older episodes like a fraction of their length. I'm interested to see how a modern X-files storyline will play out.
XFiles,3e4ohf,monotoonz,4,Wed Jul 22 01:45:24 2015 UTC,"I remember when I was old enough to really understand X-Files and decided to watch it again (back when it would come on TNT[?] from like 1am-5am), I'd get so mad at how Scully would just ignore some of the things she had seen.  What REALLY pissed me off was when she would believe in ""signs from God,"" but still question Mulder's beliefs. Oooh how I hated that. But that just goes to show how great the writing and acting was. Love it!"
XFiles,3e4ohf,happyfinesad,9,Tue Jul 21 23:34:21 2015 UTC,"Really? I found that the older I got (and consequently the further along in my career in science I got) that I identified with Scully way more than Mulder.   He's essentially a conspiracy theorist who believes in bigfoot and little green men, and almost never gets the evidence he requires to prove those things exist. Not to mention, he trusts really shady people, who it would not be unreasonable to assume are obfuscating and twisting the truth to throw Mulder off.  She's a hard-nose skeptic, and it's appropriate for her to constantly question Spooky Mulder's ridiculous claims. Just because we, the viewers, know he's legit doesn't mean anyone else does.  But I agree, her faith in god despite the fact that she's such a good scientist I always thought was lazy writing."
XFiles,3e4ohf,stophauntingme,5,Tue Jul 21 23:55:55 2015 UTC,"But I agree, her faith in god despite the fact that she's such a good scientist I always thought was lazy writing.   ...? She was raised religious & it was part of her identity throughout the series. It was a really nice touch, I thought, because a) science doesn't reject religion or vice versa (that's only a recent modern BS fad to believe they do: historically science & religion were entwined & in love with each other which is honestly how it should be) and b) Scully's faith was a great way to establish that while she's a skeptic, she's not the kind of skeptic that'll freak out over an explanation that seemingly rejects science.   She's not scared of the unknown because she has religion... which then enables her to calmly & rationally study & understand the unknown with science."
XFiles,3e4ohf,happyfinesad,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:13:42 2015 UTC,"You don't know many modern scientists, I'm guessing."
XFiles,3e4ohf,stophauntingme,3,Wed Jul 22 00:32:25 2015 UTC,"You only know about Bill Nye & Neil Degrasse Tyson, I'm guessing.  Just as most people, most scientists in the world grew up with a religion & regard their faith as an important part of who they are."
XFiles,3e4ohf,happyfinesad,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:37:02 2015 UTC,"I speak with scientists on a daily basis. I am a scientist in training.  I'm not going to get into a religious debate here because I neither have the energy nor the patience. However, despite what you believe about the religious beliefs of scientists, they are in fact the largest group of secular individuals on the planet.   just over half of scientists (51%) believe in some form of higher power; specifically, 33% of scientists say they believe in God, while 18% believe in a universal spirit or higher power. By contrast, 95% of Americans believe in some form of deity or higher power, according to a survey of the general public conducted by the Pew Research Center in July 2006.    I would even argue that these results are on the high side of things. Ask your average biologist if they believe in god and you might get laughed at.  Regardless of that, Scully is a fictional character, and subject to the biases of her writers. I personally think, as a scientist-in-training, that her eventual resurgence of faith is not only lazy writing, but implausible and unrealistic. Especially so given her tendency to be skeptical about other outrageous claims, some which are much less ridiculous than those made by the Roman Catholic church.   Then again, it's a sci-fi series about monsters, so I try not to take it too seriously."
XFiles,3e4ohf,stophauntingme,2,Wed Jul 22 00:51:49 2015 UTC,You say scientists are the largest group of secular individuals on the planet & cite a survey taken of only US citizens-? Really dude?   Ask your average biologist if they believe in god and you might get laughed at.   I sincerely hope this isn't true because the arrogance & cultural insensitivity behind that response is astounding. But then again it's clear you're only talking about current American scientists. And I suppose even scientists can't be immune to the global superiority complex Americans have.
XFiles,3e4ohf,happyfinesad,0,Wed Jul 22 01:09:37 2015 UTC,"Surely no greater than the global superiority complex of the religious.  Whoops, better watch my tongue lest I persecute the poor believers."
XFiles,3e4ohf,dr3blira,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:31:51 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything except your last sentiment. I definitely identify more with Scully now, and I think that she seems more reasonable than I remember.  In the X-Files Files podcast, Kumail often talks about how in the real world, Scully would be right 99% of the time. It's only in this crazy pretend world that all this shit is actually true and Mulder has these insane hunches that are always right. She's actually the better agent, because she relies more on real police work and always pushes Mulder to provide proof for his claims.   However, I can't agree that being a good scientist and religious is bad writing. It's good writing because it makes Scully a more complex human being. (Plus there are there are plenty of devout scientists.)"
XFiles,3e4ohf,C-G-B_Spender,3,Wed Jul 22 02:32:35 2015 UTC,"Her switch to believer in seasons 8 and 9 and her own strong faith is so jarring, I think her skepticism is her way of keeping Mulder both challenged and safe."
XFiles,3e4ohf,MidshipSquirrel,4,Wed Jul 22 00:01:39 2015 UTC,"Even Mulder admits he needs her to push him to do more. He has to prove these things to her, which makes him work harder to find concrete evidence.  From a storytelling perspective we need Scully there to stand in for us, to be the normal person dragged into this world of weirdness and navigate it like a rational person."
XFiles,3e4ohf,FanSubCana,2,Wed Jul 22 00:54:05 2015 UTC,I'm watching it for the first time and God... It pissed me off too...
XFiles,3e4ohf,grottohopper,4,Wed Jul 22 00:35:46 2015 UTC,"They joke about this in s7e20 ""Fight Club"" when Mulder keeps asking Scully's thoughts and she's immediately like ""These women are psychic"" and Mulder literally says ""No shit, Sherlock!""  Terrible episode but those jokes were funny."
XFiles,3e3xnf,franklydead,5,Tue Jul 21 19:39:51 2015 UTC,are they setting up for season 11 with new agents to carry the series?

XFiles,3e3xnf,keevler,2,Tue Jul 21 23:26:07 2015 UTC,I'm guessing they are part of the Darren Morgan episode.  The character names sound like a play on Mulder and Scully.  Morgan has a history of poking fun at both agents and the nature of their relationship in his previous scripts.
XFiles,3e3xnf,tokyoswan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:58:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think this is just a whimsical casting decision meant to be a sort of bizarro Mulder and Scully. No way the creators are dumb enough to launch a new spin off with a pale imitation of the original stars. If they're going to do a new series with new stars they need fresh characters we haven't seen before.  Also, Amell is only 27 and Ambrose is 37. That would be a strange and unseemly pairing."

XFiles,3dw50v,wheredidwecomefrom,7,Mon Jul 20 00:58:39 2015 UTC,"I've been wondering this for awhile: what do x-files fans in this sub think of fanfiction, shipping, fandom activity overall? In /r/Supernatural we were treated a bit like trash & so we ended up creating /r/fandomnatural so we could hang out together without users attacking us for the way we enjoy our favorite show(s)...   A lot of us were (still are) huge xfiles fans in the 90s & so a couple of off-hand threads in there have wondered if it's a similar situation here in /r/xfiles. Are people in here super friendly to shippers & fanfiction & whatnot or would anyone appreciate a separate sub like /r/fandomfiles that focuses upon fandom things a bit more besides just canon: fanon, fanart, fanfic, etc.-?"
XFiles,3dw50v,stophauntingme,7,Mon Jul 20 03:30:17 2015 UTC,I used to read a ton of fanfic back in the day.. I haven't lately though. I guess I don't know where to start to find good stuff. Is Gossamer still around?  I don't think we need a separate sub for fanfic because this one is pretty small already IMO.
XFiles,3dw50v,SansaScully,6,Mon Jul 20 03:58:49 2015 UTC,"As far as I can tell, Gossamer still exists in an inactive, stripped-down form. I looked it up fairly recently and was like, ""Whoa ... I just forgot what decade this is for a second!"" ;)  If you're a shipper here's a fairly extensive curated archive of M/S fic. Otherwise, AO3 has a couple thousand fics and ff.net has about 10k, but there's no accounting for quality there, of course."
XFiles,3dw50v,bragandbounce,4,Mon Jul 20 04:48:27 2015 UTC,"You're awesome, thank you for the link! I love that it's MSR/Angst fic. Angsty fic is my shit."

XFiles,3dw50v,LucidDreamer18,5,Mon Jul 20 05:01:08 2015 UTC,"Shipper here. I've read one fanfic piece that I actually liked; am open to discovering good fanfic.   From what I've seen on this sub, there isn't a negative attitude towards fanfic or shippers.   I mean, the majority of X-Files fans are shippers, right?!"
XFiles,3dw50v,tokyoswan,2,Mon Jul 20 03:47:10 2015 UTC,"I mean, the majority of X-Files fans are shippers, right?!   Considering the fandom invented the term, I would hope so. Reddit en masse generally hates the concept (somehow they got it in their head that it's an anime thing?) but this sub does seem to be okay with it.  Nevertheless, there is /r/XFilesFanFic"
XFiles,3dw50v,SyndicateSamantharoo,4,Mon Jul 20 16:56:48 2015 UTC,"I was a huge fan back in the day, and wrote a few stories myself. I cant imagine being 'a shipper' is even a valid division anymore :) after all, back then it was like 'you hopeless romantics are seeing something that isnt even there'  but I think love won out in the end.  I havent even thought about fan fic in ages. I pulled some of mine out and its inspired me to work on my own non-xfile stories again. Something about XF just ignites a creative streak."

I've seen a handful of MSR shippers, as well, but I don't know how the sub as a whole feels about shipping.  (I'm a huge MSR shipper. No shame.)"
XFiles,3dw50v,LucidDreamer18,2,Mon Jul 20 03:33:51 2015 UTC,"things like fan art and I'm sure that extends to fanfiction   lol you'd be surprised... /r/supernatural always loved fanart but one mention of fanfic or shipping and it's like ""gtfo this is stupid nonsense.""  But at any rate awesome response. If everybody's cool here then a separate fandom-centric sub wouldn't succeed."
XFiles,3dw50v,stophauntingme,2,Mon Jul 20 03:43:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think most people here are pretty accepting of anything X-Files related. I don't often see excessive amounts of downvotes or anything, if that means anything."
XFiles,3dw50v,LucidDreamer18,3,Mon Jul 20 03:50:51 2015 UTC,"I think people are generally fine with fan-stuff. And if they're not, they're not being forced to look at any of it.  If the majority of the sub is against it, then I understand creating a new sub. But in my experience, new subs tend to die sad and alone because only a handful of people ever visit them, and then people just lose interest. I'd rather see that sort of thing stay on the main sub. Maybe the mods can create content filters or tags?"
XFiles,3dw50v,stophauntingme,2,Mon Jul 20 03:39:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah - a separate fandom-centric subreddit wouldn't succeed if people are happy here.   /r/Fandomnatural was created out of a pretty deep need for people to feel comfortable being a fan of the show given the toxic stuff directed at them in /r/Supernatural. We've been kicking ass for over 2 years now with 3.1k+ subscribers - we definitely didn't die & nobody lost interest.  But that's all predicated on a need from fans who feel shitty in the main subreddit. If /r/xfiles is totally friendly & there's literally no need for a fandom-centric sub because of that, that's so much better."
XFiles,3dw50v,dr3blira,5,Mon Jul 20 03:50:01 2015 UTC,"I would love some good recommendations. I've been trying to find some good ones, and I'll share the best archives I've found below, but I've found that since the X-Files was originally broadcast in the early days of internet fanfiction, a ton of it is really out of character or just poorly written. Still, there is some great stuff out there.  Sites I've used:  Gossamer is the ultimate X-Files fanfiction site.  Pros: It's huge and every story is hosted on the site, so you don't get broken links.   Cons: Because it's huge, you have to wade through a lot of crappy stories.  Whispers of X is your place for R- and NC-17 rated stories.  Pros: All R or NC-17 stories (if you're into that sort of thing...), all hosted on the site so no broken links.   Cons: Lots of cheesy porn without plot stories.  Two Close for Comfort is an archive of all the stories in which Mulder and Scully are forced into close quarters together. It's organized by location (hotel, apartment, quarantine, etc).  Pros: Lots of UST (G- and PG-rated) ranging up to RST (PG-13 and up). All stories hosted on the site.  Cons: It's a narrow plot device that results in a lot of cliches.    Gertie's Romantic/Angst Archive is all Mulder/Scully shipper stories.  Pros: I think it's mostly higher quality stories, and if you're a shipper, it's great.  Cons: Some of the links aren't archived on the site, so you have to use archive.org for the broken links.  Specialized Archive Links is great if you have a specific type of fanfiction that you like. There's probably an archive of just those fics, and you can find them here. There are a lot of broken links though.  Edit: I forgot about The Salvation Archive, which has great Mulder/Scully stories.  I'll update later with some specific stories that I've bookmarked."

XFiles,3dssgp,growling_puppy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:52:23 2015 UTC,The only problem with no skipping MOTW episodes is that you probably won't be able to remember exactly what happened in past mytharc episodes (it's hard enough to keep the mythology straight even when watching mytharc episodes in serial).

It used to be on at 11am during the summer when my brother and I were home alone, and for some stupid reason I would still watch it. Then I'd be terrified at every little noise for the rest of the day.  I remember they also used to show a lot of UFO/alien specials on TV in the 90's... I think some of the XF actors even did voiceovers for some of them."

I watched so many horror movies and never got scared but Robert Stack got me every time!  There was also an episode of a talk show around the same time (I think Oprah?) about alien abductees and one woman's story scared me more than anything ever.

Judging by the uniforms at the crash it looks as if we will see the birth of the conspiracy. Which is kinda cool. For a show about aliens we never got the nitty gritty from that.

XFiles,3dl99l,wheredidwecomefrom,11,Fri Jul 17 04:33:29 2015 UTC,"I think Mulder knew when Scully was abducted, and definitely knew by the time she had cancer.  I think it took Scully much longer to actually realize it. I think she always loved him, but never really realized it.  I could see Milagro being the turning point. Especially because (I think) The Unnatural comes right after it, and there's that adorable baseball date at the end. Mulder almost loses Scully in Milagro, and then makes a big romantic gesture in the next episode. Seems to fit for me."
XFiles,3dl99l,LucidDreamer18,9,Fri Jul 17 04:37:31 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. I always felt like Mulder was in love with Scully way before she accepted that she had feelings for him, too... which is perfect for their characters, because it always took longer for Scully to accept things."
XFiles,3dl99l,SansaScully,12,Fri Jul 17 05:43:08 2015 UTC,"I don't know...there's a lot to be said about the scene in Tooms when Scully calls him Fox and says she wouldn't put herself on the line for anyone but him, and he comes back with telling her to call him Mulder and making a distancing joke about iced tea.   I think Scully may have had a ""crush"" on him from early on. He was a really attractive, intelligent, interesting guy who challenged her and was exciting. I think her feelings deepened during Beyond the Sea when she was dealing with her dad's death and Mulder's potential death.  She certainly loved him (at least as a friend) in Anasazi/Blessing Way/Paper Clip when she was able to tell his mom that she ""just knew"" that he wasn't dead.  I think Scully admitted to herself that she loved him early on, but she didn't want to risk losing their friendship/partnership since Mulder had always shown that the X-Files and finding his sister are the only things that matter to him.  Mulder realized he cared for her during her abduction, but that might have been because he felt guilty. But, I think the fact that he traded Scully for who he thought was his sister in Colony/End Game shows that his feelings for her went deeper than that. Then, when she had cancer and he told CSM that finding a cure for Scully was the thing that he wanted most (even above Samantha) he was clearly in love with Scully."
XFiles,3dl99l,Pendrell_Crush,4,Fri Jul 17 06:27:35 2015 UTC,"Good points.  You're absolutely right about when he trades Samantha for Scully. He sacrificed what he had been chasing for years to protect his partner, which says a lot.  I can agree that Scully had a crush on him, but I don't think it went beyond that for a while (beyond a very strong friendship, that is). I kind of think there was a lot going on that never put her in a position to evaluate that relationship. Proving herself in the FBI, finding The Truth, policies at work, and a general ""all work, no play"" attitude."
XFiles,3dl99l,LucidDreamer18,4,Fri Jul 17 06:48:09 2015 UTC,"I think you're right. It's funny to see Scully in the first season when she still had some friends and went out on a date compared to the later seasons when she's portrayed as a really private, somewhat closed off person who only interacts on a meaningful level with Mulder. This progression actually makes sense because the things that she's experiencing really rock the foundation of her previous life, and her abduction happens fairly early on in the second season, so she loses her innocence pretty quickly.   All of that, like you said, probably doesn't give her the opportunity to really examine her relationship with Mulder. And even if she does, and realizes she has romantic feelings toward him, she might think that it's not the best idea to get involved given the seriousness and danger of the broader situation."

XFiles,3dl99l,susliks,7,Wed Jul 22 01:59:38 2015 UTC,"I think Mulder was testing her throughout the pilot, and she passed the test right there. Who ever stayed with him after hearing his story about his sister? When she stayed and tried to understand, she earned his respect. Respect and trust come first, over and over again."
XFiles,3dl99l,MidshipSquirrel,3,Fri Jul 17 17:36:55 2015 UTC,"I think one of the things that makes their relationship unique is a love built on a deep respect and friendship. It's not a fireworks and trumpets sort of thing. And I've always felt Mulder in particular has a very compassionate heart which leads him to get in too deep where he should keep more distance and use his head. Scully is more likely to stay back and tread carefully. No wonder it took her much longer to come around to the idea. I mean come on, Mulder is the kind of guy who will get holes drilled in his head on a whim, and is pretty obsessive and impulsive. He can't be easy to live with."

It's one of the most beautiful displays of a sincere friendship turning into love that I have ever watched. David and Gillian do a superb job of bringing those emotions to the screen. As far as realizing it - I do think Mulder came to that realization first. Probably after she was abducted - he wears her cross! Definitely by the time she has cancer, though. I also think he was completely aware of himself in Triangle when he told Scully he loved her. For Scully, I kind of remember it being 4th or 5th season-ish. There's that look on her face when they go to kiss in his hallway - she's almost afraid, but she knows!   Gah! I love this show!!! I'm so happy to be discussing this with other MSR shippers.

I built my own X-Files trivia website and I would record the tv shows and post trivia to the website like what is Mulders apartment number? (don't remember now without looking online... like 43 or something?) but just weird shit like that. I fucking loved it. Still do. I'm not as fanatical as you guys because I don't visit this sub all that much let alone post here much but damn. Fucking love the show. Also LOVE the first movie. The 2nd one was a massive disappointment.

The story is incredibly complex and convoluted, and too spread out over the course of the entire show.   I suggest just watching the first X-Files movie (Fight the Future) and looking for a short synopsis on the show (like this one on ELI5).  In the meantime, watch the pilot and the final episode, and enjoy some monster of the week episodes (standalone episodes that don't affect the main story) to get back into the atmosphere of the show. There are some scary ones, some hilarious ones. Conduit (S01E04) makes me cry at the end :("

A shadowy figure is dragging two bloodied humanoid figures on the floor and outside to a waiting vehicle.  4) Very briefly we see some kind of menacing surgical tool descending on to what is presumably a human test subject.  5) Another extremely brief cut. Here we see the legs of man stepping on and over an ""I Want to Believe"" poster strewn on the floor, suggesting this could be Mulder's old office or his current living quarters.  6) Finally, we see two brief shots, one of Mulder peeking out from behind a wall, and the next of Scully brandishing a gun and flashlight."

XFiles,3dhbk5,expiredtvdinner,2,Thu Jul 16 11:36:30 2015 UTC,I'm keeping track of Netflix transitions. All episodes I've watched from Season 5 so far on Amazon Prime have been in HD.
XFiles,3dhbk5,snrrub,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:42:18 2015 UTC,"As you can see, Netflix is the clear winner here.   Would wager the iTunes 720p looks better than either."
XFiles,3dhbk5,snrrub,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:04:47 2015 UTC,"What makes you say that? The bit-rate offered by iTunes in 720p would be substantially lower, resulting in more compression artifacts and less detail in the picture."
XFiles,3dhbk5,snrrub,3,Thu Jul 16 10:23:37 2015 UTC,"It's been known in a/v circles for a long time that iTunes 720p is superior to iTunes 1080p in the majority of cases (at least 75% of shows).   It might seem counter-intuitive to the layman because a lot of people assume resolution = quality but in reality there is much more to it.   iTunes 1080p is bit-starved (only 25% more bitrate vs 720p despite 2x the pixels). To try and compensate for the bitrate starvation, they run the 1080p through some heavy DNR which kills high frequency detail.  iTunes 720p simply looks better (than iTunes 1080p) in the majority of cases.  I probably jumped the gun by saying it will also look better than NF 1080p but it's a comparison I would like to see."
XFiles,3dhbk5,snrrub,2,Thu Jul 16 10:44:39 2015 UTC,"I had no idea. It goes to how much I know about compression. I just tended to go off of the overall bit-rate vs resolution, and the group that encoded it. It's from there I found trends from respected encoder's.  Makes me wonder, what's Apple's thinking behind this? Is it so it keeps the file size down? You'd think a company would achieve better results than scene groups.  I'm curious now, I'll have change my settings over on iTunes and grab the 720p version and compare it.  Update: So I compared the the 720p and 1080p iTunes versions and could barely distinguish them. It looked like the 720p one had more detail, but I wonder if it's just a placebo. I thought regardless of resolution, that the higher bit-rate version (in this case, iTunes in 1080p) would have more detail?"
XFiles,3dhbk5,franklydead,2,Thu Jul 16 11:12:54 2015 UTC,"Makes me wonder, what's Apple's thinking behind this?   Most consumers don't know anything about picture quality. They just know they want 1080p, because more p must be better, right?. And they also want low bitrates. So Apple gives them what they want.    I thought regardless of resolution, that the higher bit-rate version (in this case, iTunes in 1080p) would have more detail?   It's got a higher bitrate (5Mbps vs 4Mbps) but 25% more is not enough to maintain the same level of quality considering there are approx twice the pixels. (it's not quite so simple but for the sake of this discussion this level of depth will suffice)  So overall the quality goes down slightly, and Apple give it a lot of DNR to help compressibility (which is a reduction in quality in and of itself).   Within a single show that is overall worse in 1080p, sure - you will find frames here and there which look better. But the overall viewing experience is usually worse.   As I said, it's not everything, but a majority. The situation has improved slightly each year. Normally I decide on a show by show basis."

XFiles,3dat43,dimeadozen09,2,Wed Jul 15 03:48:14 2015 UTC,Also I would argue that no one is more excited about the X-Files revival than I am.
XFiles,3da9nc,teleekom,7,Tue Jul 14 18:43:46 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, on of the most important and exciting episodes of the entire series. Hard truth of the conspiracy.  Creepy alien silhouettes and a real UFO.  A recognizable landmark gives me goosebumps whenever I drive by it.  I feel the canon really starts to come together, and take off from this episode.  A real classic.    Always wished they had taken some of the files from the cabinets with them when they left.  But oh well.  Still an A+ episode."
XFiles,3da9nc,snickerson11,4,Tue Jul 14 22:22:21 2015 UTC,"Every time I watch this episode I scream, ""grab a few of the goddamn files! You had them in your hands! Really!?""   Definitely one of my favorites. An X-files essential."
XFiles,3da9nc,2317-616,5,Tue Jul 14 22:30:26 2015 UTC,All I can say is this is my favorite Mythology episode. The whole sequence at the warehouse is X-files at it's best.
XFiles,3da9nc,SuperSonicGanja,2,Tue Jul 14 22:19:54 2015 UTC,"This is one of my favorite episodes of the entire series. It's perfect from start to finish. The scene in the mine is incredibly cinematic and exciting, the scene with Mulder coming out and seeing the ship is fantastic and the following scene with the guys shooting at Mulder is awesome. The scene with Krycek running out of the car as it explodes is great, and it's always great to see Walter Gotell in stuff. I liked him since I saw him in several Bond movies. I do wish he had more stuff to do in the episode. Great voice.   I also love the scene where the Well-Manicured Man explains the plan to Mulder and Scully, and of course, the ending where Skinner basically kicks the CSM's ass (not literally) is AWESOME to watch, and still probably one of my favorite Skinner moments."
XFiles,3da9nc,redisforever,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:35:38 2015 UTC,"What a fantastic episode. The X-Files being its absolute most X-Filesy. Dark corridors, an abandoned mined, creepy tunnel full files on citizens. Rock-solid mythology and character development. And we get great moments from all the players, including Skinner and some outside ones."
XFiles,3da9nc,lochalsh,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:20:38 2015 UTC,Idk what was up in the mine with the aliens and all. It was a great episode.

XFiles,3da9nc,skizmcniz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:00:55 2015 UTC,I'm largely confused. Why would Scully trade that tape just to see her sister? Why couldn't anyone get data of the tape? Print screen that stuff! Are those old men the Legion of Doom? Why isn't any of the information used?  Will there ever be a time Skinner doesn't get his tail kicked?
XFiles,3daot8,JasonWilley777,2,Tue Jul 14 20:26:04 2015 UTC,"The first and last episodes are about Aliens, the four in between are standalones and all new ideas, no old monster are returned."
XFiles,3daot8,1983nico,2,Tue Jul 14 23:11:33 2015 UTC,I heard only one or two are stand Alones. PLUS David Duchovny said the series is essentially a 6 hour movie. Which implies that while they may be investigating non alien cases the mythology is clearly alive and well across the 6 episode. Also Chris Carter has said they won't be ignoring the past   ie the date of invasion passing Etc.
XFiles,3d9xgl,ejchristian86,8,Tue Jul 14 17:21:12 2015 UTC,"How amazing is it when Mulder and Scully have a standoff, guns pointed at each other? It's like, ""Mommy and daddy aren't supposed to fight!""   Also, when Scully turns to leave the supply room and Mulder pulls her back by her shirt collar and examines her... Please tell me I'm not the only one who discovered the power of Unresolved Sexual Tension in that moment."
XFiles,3d9xgl,dr3blira,7,Tue Jul 14 17:55:14 2015 UTC,"YES! I think that might have been the most physical contact they've had up to this point, and it was super sexually charged.  Speaking of which... I read a fanfic not too long ago that was a ""missing scene"" and I cannot for the life of me find it right now and it's totally ruining my day. Scully goes into Mulder's room and nothing happens, but she realizes she wants something to happen. Ugh. Now it's going to bug me 'til I find it.  Edit: Ta-DAAAAAAAH!"

Finding stories to read has been a real blast from the past. The X-Files introduced me to fanfiction way back in 1996 when my family got our first home computer."

XFiles,3d9xgl,dr3blira,2,Wed Jul 15 19:04:48 2015 UTC,one of my favorite episodes of season one for sure!
XFiles,3d9xgl,Saltones,2,Tue Jul 14 23:43:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this was a standout for me. The tension among the handful of characters is very well written and acted. And just enough dry humor. (""Remember, we are in the arctic."")"

I wish he had a larger role.  I love that Mulder just dropped everything and went from DC to MA to see his father, because his father was like ""come, please"".    I very distinctly remember the exchange,  ""You're lucky she's a good shot""  ""Or a bad one""  from when I was younger.  Had no idea what episode it was, though"

XFiles,3d15a9,Patricia_Brandon,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:27:29 2015 UTC,The entertainment magazine article says what is clear is that they are not living together.
XFiles,3d15a9,EveryGoodNameIsGone,3,Tue Jul 14 08:49:04 2015 UTC,"They were together since at least season 7's all things (which began with Scully getting dressed in Mulder's bathroom after having spent the night, Mulder still asleep in his bed), probably earlier. They just didn't explicitly show it. They were also clearly still together in the season 8 finale, and the series finale.  In fact, I think most people miss the fact that IWTB actually causes a rift between them, and if you treat the post-credit boat ""scene"" as a non-canon in-joke (come on, they wave at the freaking camera!) their relationship status is very much up in the air at the end of the movie. They never really reconcile before the credits roll.  So, as has been speculated, it makes sense that they're no longer together by the time of the new season."
XFiles,3d15a9,MidshipSquirrel,3,Sun Jul 12 21:56:00 2015 UTC,"I felt they were reconciled by the time the credits rolled. I think at first the rift bothered me, but that's life. Things aren't always easy. But you don't let the rough spots throw you, especially after all they have put up with.   If they aren't together at the beginning of the new season, they'd better be together by the end. Their devotion to each other is part of what makes it work. I can't see it any other way.   Edit: Thanks for bringing up the post-credits scene, I had not seen that before. Love it :) I guess she took him up on his offer to run away."

When I heard they were brought back in the Season 10 comics I was pissed and gave up on the comics at that moment. Not only does it cheapen their heroic deaths to bring them back randomly, but them showing up as ghosts prevents it from ever making sense anyway.  And yet people still want it to happen because people hate/fear change.  Sorry I'm so salty."
XFiles,3cxzpp,Majestic87,3,Sun Jul 12 00:20:26 2015 UTC,The salt is justified. It's cheap to violate the integrity of the show's continuity just to pay some meaningless fan service.

I think what ruined last seasons was the spiritual tone that took the series, it was enough that Scully is the believer, make Mulder to talk with spirits and believe in God, when at the end of Season 6 tell us that God does not exist, which is a creation of the aliens was what ruined mythology.  The same happened with the last season of LOST and final episode of TRUE DETECTIVE, I get the impression that in a culture like  the American judging atheists more than those who have a different religiÃ³n, writers are afraid of offending religious believers, and always end up falling into the same cliches."

There's no win for her but to pursue the work.  I'm surprised the little bit of nudity came through as well as it did, unblurred.  I wasn't sure if the child at the end was a boy or a girl.

I left off the Pilot only because it technically isn't part of the season, and I feel it doesn't really represent the show that well.  And the S3 episodes The Walk, The List, and 2Shy I think are really good, and some of the darkest material that the show ever dealt with.  Conduit and Red Museum are probably skippable, but they have their moments and tie in somewhat to the larger mythology."

XFiles,3cjoof,catelldm,7,Wed Jul 8 13:03:32 2015 UTC,"MOTW episodes contribute a lot to character development of both Mulder and Scully.  There are some truly terrible ones (3, Fight Club), but there are some truly great ones (Tooms, Humbug, Home [because you have to]).  If you don't want to watch all of them you can probably skip all of season 9 and just go straight to the finale.  That'll cut 20 ish episodes..."
XFiles,3cjoof,growling_puppy,4,Wed Jul 8 13:34:26 2015 UTC,"This was one of the first shows to do a very serialized arc, but while I like the mythology, I think only watching that story would leave you with a poor impression of the show.  The first problem is that the mythology is not really consistent and doesn't make much sense. In the first seasons, it does make more sense, although it's convoluted. Then in the middle of Season 6 they try to sort of wrap up the mythology, and it actually was a pretty good, question-answering wrapup. Then they started adding new major elements to it, but the alien mythology very much got to be marginalized in the second half of Season 6 and Season 7, and after another wrapup in the Season 7 finale, the mythology switched to a complete ridiculous story for the last two seasons.  It's very entertaining in my opinion, but the mythology was nowhere near as consistent as modern-day serialized shows like Breaking Bad or True Detective.  The next problem is that there just isn't that much mythology. That's 5 eps in Season 1, then 7-8 in Seasons 2-4, 5 again in Seasons 5, 6, and 7, I think, leaving the two last seasons aside for the moment.  And of course now any fan will tell you that the strongest aspect of the show was the relationship between Mulder and Scully. They really are two great characters with fantastic interactions on the screen, but their character development mostly happens in the MOTW episodes. The mythology episodes pack a lot of plot and action into their 45 minutes so they leave less room for the characters. Scully's character is developed a lot in standalones like ""Beyond the Sea"", ""all things"", ""Christmas Carol"", ""Tithonus"" or ""Milagro"". Mulder's character sees a lot of development in ""Young at Heart"", ""Paper Hearts"" or ""Grotesque"", and then there are standalone episodes like ""Quagmire"" that do a lot to develop their relationship. Only watching the mythology would actually leave you with less impression of the characters than skipping it altogether.  Finally, there are many episodes that are considered ""classic X-Files"" because they simply are great standalone television, but they are standalones and even in different genres.  There are lists on this subreddit of great episodes to watch per season, you should look those up!"
XFiles,3cjoof,CreepyOctopus,2,Wed Jul 8 19:48:54 2015 UTC,"The mythology is fantastic but you'd get much less character development/classic X-Files moments. There are some spectacular MOW episodes.

My people have come to trust memory over history. Memory, like fire, is radiant and immutable, while history serves only those who seek to control it - those who douse the flame of memory in order to put out the dangerous fire of truth. Beware these men for they are dangerous themselves and unwise. Their false history is written in the blood of those who might remember and of those who seek the truth.""

XFiles,3cghqi,franklydead,2,Tue Jul 7 23:59:37 2015 UTC,omg i'm so exciteddddd for the new season i can't handle it
XFiles,3cghqi,myshowercurtain,2,Wed Jul 8 00:57:56 2015 UTC,those last 8 seconds...maaaaaaaan
XFiles,3cghqi,arcruff,2,Wed Jul 8 04:01:10 2015 UTC,The new footage looked like the home of that serial killer from the episode Grotesque.
XFiles,3cghqi,monotoonz,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:06:15 2015 UTC,QUESTION: There is a background ambient sound right at the moment when the new version duo is shown on the trailer.   What is that ambient sound called for search purposes?  This sound is the slightly whirring speaker feedback or alarm kind of a sound as if coming from a pa system far away.   Can anyone help?
XFiles,3choqw,franklydead,18,Wed Jul 8 00:07:09 2015 UTC,"I'd be happier with 13, but I'll take what I can get. David and Gillian are busy folks nowadays, after all."
XFiles,3choqw,EveryGoodNameIsGone,8,Wed Jul 8 00:20:19 2015 UTC,not so much with hannibal being cancelled :(
XFiles,3choqw,westcoastmaximalist,11,Wed Jul 8 00:33:08 2015 UTC,"She still has ""The Fall."""
XFiles,3choqw,LucidDreamer18,4,Wed Jul 8 00:35:23 2015 UTC,hope it means more xfiles.
XFiles,3choqw,Japface,7,Wed Jul 8 01:04:28 2015 UTC,Hannibal will no longer be on NBC....doesn't mean it's over. Fuller has stated that the show is not dead yet.
XFiles,3choqw,joosh82,4,Wed Jul 8 01:21:37 2015 UTC,"Amazon and Netflix passed up on it, and the actors' contracts are over. It is pretty much dead."
XFiles,3choqw,myshowercurtain,15,Wed Jul 8 17:22:40 2015 UTC,I think they're just seeing if there's still interest in the series. If so they might go on to do 13 episode seasons like OITNB.
XFiles,3choqw,LucidDreamer18,7,Wed Jul 8 01:00:28 2015 UTC,I just hope the cast and crew have enough interest. I wouldn't want to see someone duck out early like DD did because their heart wasn't in it.
XFiles,3choqw,alsoye,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:09:14 2015 UTC,Gillian said this is it for her.  David said he'd be open to this turning into a 6-episode thing every year but Gillian said she sees this 6-ep arc as closure.
XFiles,3choqw,myshowercurtain,6,Wed Jul 8 02:03:27 2015 UTC,where and when did she say that?
XFiles,3choqw,alsoye,-3,Wed Jul 8 02:08:50 2015 UTC,"A recent convention interview, the link is on this subreddit a few weeks back unfortunately :("
XFiles,3choqw,Holroyd,6,Wed Jul 8 05:58:30 2015 UTC,I really hope that isn't true.
XFiles,3choqw,Pockets6794,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:05:31 2015 UTC,"Same. It's hard being a spectator/viewer because you don't know how the actors truly feel about the work. If the new series turns out to be an amazing work of art, maybe Gillian will reconsider, but I get the vibe that she's doing it for the nostalgia, fans and old crew/friends involved with it all. Like she's doing it for the history, not for the sake of art and an incredible 6-hour piece of television. Which is fine, it just explains her statements."
XFiles,3choqw,mike1883,3,Wed Jul 8 14:19:25 2015 UTC,It's strange because it seemed like she was the person pushing for it most.
XFiles,3choqw,sirgraemecracker,-1,Wed Jul 8 15:59:32 2015 UTC,I can live with her character dying. Imo Mulder is the xfiles.
XFiles,3choqw,mike1883,3,Wed Jul 8 23:49:55 2015 UTC,"Except Scully can't die.  She's immortal.  If this isn't really subtly subtly touched on during the new series, I'll be disappointing."
XFiles,3choqw,SansaScully,-3,Thu Jul 9 01:56:50 2015 UTC,Find then hopefully the Aliens take her away to a place far far away.
XFiles,3choqw,alsoye,9,Thu Jul 9 02:09:34 2015 UTC,"It does seem really short, especially since they're supposedly doing a couple standalone episodes.. but if we had gotten a movie instead that'd probably only be 2 hours, so I'm trying to be grateful for what I can get.   Mostly I just hope it doesn't suck."
XFiles,3choqw,tawndy,2,Wed Jul 8 01:35:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, six 45-minute episodes > 2 hours. But I'd like more as well."
XFiles,3choqw,brandon157,6,Wed Jul 8 02:04:35 2015 UTC,"Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhh. I'm quite fine with doing a shorter ""test run"" first, and it's clearly what they're doing. I have all the hopes in the world it will be good, but imagine if it's straight garbage out of the gate...  This is my favorite show and I want nothing more than for this to succeed, but I'm trying to keep my hopes from getting out of control. Convince me with this mini series that everyone involved still has ""it,"" then I'll look forward to more episodes..."
XFiles,3choqw,outerdark,3,Wed Jul 8 02:04:23 2015 UTC,"of course its never enough but I believe it is to set up and new series staring a new ""mulder and scully"" if the ratings are good but think of this the average episode of x files when running did a 6 share in todays numbers it would be one of the top rated shows on TV up there with big bang and ncis."
XFiles,3choqw,sunnyandtony,3,Wed Jul 8 02:18:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah six episodes is not a lot. Will all six revisit the conspiracy storylines, or are there going to be MOTW episodes too? If this run touches on both, I can't see how a season this short can wrap things up nicely (CC's storylines are so messy).   I just want Krycek to show up PLEASE."
XFiles,3choqw,SHdude,2,Wed Jul 8 05:38:16 2015 UTC,"For me, I am more interested in Fox's game plan for the show than I am about the numbers. Honestly, it is either my first or second favorite tv show ever, but when you think about it, it seems like they could have sold the rights to an online tv company, like netflix, and it could have been produced that way.  The reason why I say this is because Fox is really good at cutting shows before they are realistically finished. Yet, the X-Files by the eighth and ninth seasons were not that great. It really should have turned into a spin-off show. Yeah, I know we already had two of those, if you count Millennium (which is a great show, too).  But with a failed movie return, what does Fox network hope to gain? Of course we will all watch it and enjoy whatever we are spoon-fed, assuming it isn't the second movie again, but at the same time, doesn't Fox have better ways to invest?   Don't get me wrong. I am not at all trying to talk them out of doing this. I just wonder what they expect with six episodes after thirteen years. Sure, if they did a full season of 22 to 26 episodes, it would be great, but a half season or six... what is that? Yes, they have other commitments, but still..  I guess I still feel burned after what happened with Jericho."
XFiles,3choqw,sunnyandtony,2,Wed Jul 8 05:38:15 2015 UTC,I imagine The X-Files is well-known and beloved enough to justify continuing to spend money on.   Not to mention that it still probably reaped in tonnes of viewers during its weakest seasons.
XFiles,3choqw,SHdude,2,Wed Jul 8 11:04:50 2015 UTC,"Is the January time frame the weakest? I thought Summer was. I agree that it probably will rake in a more money than an unknown show might, especially since FOX has a bad habit of cancelling the good shows and putting trash in as a replacement.   In the end, I hope FOX makes more than they expected from it. Whether they continue the series with Mulder and Scully or they make a new series with new characters, I am all for it. I really thought after the first few episodes that Supernatural would have ended up in an X-Files-like position, but it didn't happen."
XFiles,3choqw,Holroyd,3,Wed Jul 8 13:18:18 2015 UTC,"I do think that if it does well enough, that we'll get an ongoing revival in some form. Whether it'll have Mulder and Scully or some new duo will probably be dependent on the schedules of David and Gillian, but I definitely forsee it continuing in some capacity.   You bringing up Supernatural is a pretty good point. The X-Files could also be the show FOX needs to compete with Supernatural's current success.  Either way, I'm sure the future contains only good things for the series."
XFiles,3choqw,slowlauris,2,Wed Jul 8 13:27:53 2015 UTC,"They're probably testing the waters, but I would've gone with 10 episodes, or maybe 8. It doesn't seem like quite enough room for mythology episodes and stand-alones. I like True Detective's 8 episode format.  Hopefully the episodes are an hour in length rather than 40-45 minutes, but I doubt it."
XFiles,3choqw,BlueKun,2,Wed Jul 8 07:18:12 2015 UTC,"I get what you are saying. however, the X files has never been about closure. black and white fairytale endings are not what CC does, and is not who Mulder is, either.  I'm being cautiously optimistic that we will get six servings of artful television, with new monsters and obstacles, suspense and character development.   my only slightly qualified hope is that all of them are better than the plot and execution of IWTB."
XFiles,3choqw,iuJacob,2,Wed Jul 8 17:07:14 2015 UTC,"Not nearly enough, but considering a year ago I wasn't sure if we would ever get new X-Files again, I'll take it. Hopefully this run will be successful and everyone will be down with some more installments in the future."
XFiles,3choqw,joosh82,2,Wed Jul 8 18:17:18 2015 UTC,"i spoke with someone who is working on season 10 (i work for a company that is dealing with the production). paraphrasing here, but they said 6 episodes to see 'how it goes'... there is interest in more should things play out the way everyone wants. at this stage of the game though, nobody (including the actors themselves) is really able to say anything."
XFiles,3choqw,Holroyd,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:28:33 2015 UTC,Good to hear!
XFiles,3choqw,joosh82,3,Thu Jul 9 14:02:49 2015 UTC,"If the episodes are good, I'm happy with 6. I want more, eventually, but I'm okay with a short series each year.  Unless....they're using this as a bridge/launch for a new Joel McHale series.....which I'm intrigued by"
XFiles,3choqw,Holroyd,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:22:23 2015 UTC,"He plays a conservative television host. I don't want to judge a book by its cover but it doesn't sound like a character that could hold its own television series, let alone a decent X-Files spin-off."
XFiles,3choqw,CreepyOctopus,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:14:58 2015 UTC,I thought he was a FBI agent?
