I (and lots of others) ride their fish a bit below your actual height, so if you're up for that short of a board you'd be fine. I think an egg would be a better intermediate step, though.  I shaped this egg for a buddy in your similar circumstance (wanting to progress to a shorter board from a foamie) and he loves it. It has enough volume to float him well and it glides great, so he has no problems getting into waves. It is a 4+1 so he can throw in a single fin to get loose or a quad set for a little more performance. He can duck dive it no problem and it is really versatile."

In our experience, they function well the first year but go down-hill quickly after.  Bands discolor and snap, and the features (tides and light for example) shit the bed and quit working properly.  Another annoying problem is when the battery dies you can't just take them to a watch/jewelry repair guy to get the it replaced due to the watertight seal.  You have to send them back to the manufacturer to get that done and it's a pain in the ass.    All that aside, I don't have the Search but it looks really neat.

Well, I got my watch for Christmas. I'm back in my gshock because the rip curl stopped working. The compass was now wrong, the tide chart didn't display and it got stuck on a period of the tide for sine random day in May. My buddy warned me that his dad's was a piece of shit. I thought I was fine because I got a different model. I thought for $250 I would be getting a good watch. I didn't. After that experience I'm for sure thinking twice before getting any rip curl watch.

surfing,3e0p4l,choomah_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:08:15 2015 UTC,"Cape town is awesome.  REALLY cold water from the Atlantic, mixed w/Indian Ocean water = BIG TIME WHITE TIPS.  I can let you know all the good breaks, depending if you're staying in Hout Bay or elsewhere.  PM me.....stoked!  It's so beautiful down there.  Just don't pull a Mick and have to hit one of those knuckleheads"
surfing,3e0p4l,Ldogw,2,Tue Jul 21 06:10:12 2015 UTC,"What's your skill level?  And where are you staying? There are lots of different spots but some are for a lot more advanced surfers.  Edit: also, what kind of wave are you looking to surf?"

surfing,3dy1k4,daitaCV,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:14:40 2015 UTC,Here's a shot of them getting picked up by the skis right next to each other so yeah it looks like Julian did get over to Mick pretty quick.  (Top of the page) http://www.worldsurfleague.com/posts/131041/j-bay-open-final-day-recap
surfing,3dy1k4,OhSendIt,-1,Tue Jul 21 06:11:31 2015 UTC,"Not saying he wasn't  paddling over to Mick, but he was paddling back out anyway. He may have had no clue what was going on. Anybody know what Julian had to say about it."
surfing,3dy1k4,surfnaked,7,Mon Jul 20 23:02:31 2015 UTC,"nah man, watch his interview afterwards.  he said that the wave put him in position for where he wanted to sit during the heat, and that mick was sitting up in no mans land.  so i don't think he was intending to paddle back up the point.  he also said when it happened he was watching mick."
surfing,3dy1k4,mellamoalex,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:36:04 2015 UTC,"Ah okay, I guess he was going up to see what's up. Thanks. Most of us would I think. I guess Mick was up the point waiting for a bigger set, but unfortunately he wasn't the only one."

surfing,3dy1k4,sjj342,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:21:17 2015 UTC,In a comp you'll always see that. Check the interview that /u/headhigh55 put on here. Answered every one of my questions.   Julian's an awesome guy.   So is Mick. he handled himself well as you could have given the shitstorm that hit him.
surfing,3dy1k4,surfnaked,11,Tue Jul 21 04:38:06 2015 UTC,"During the overhead shot where you can see the boat and the ski's headed towards Mick, you can see Julian heading right for him."

He then calls Julian a legend (while in tears) it's amazing"
surfing,3dy1k4,D-reh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:23:37 2015 UTC,i don't know if there's an iso shot but you could see it realtime on the stream so i'd check heat analyzer
surfing,3dy1k4,sjj342,-1,Mon Jul 20 15:34:20 2015 UTC,There was a scene in the wsl update. I want to say it's somewhere in the middle but I'm not going to sort through 45 minutes of footage to find it.
surfing,3e0ue0,Hamburglar789,7,Tue Jul 21 02:19:43 2015 UTC,"Small Honolua Bay is a perfect longboard wave.  You may be able to score a bump in September.  Other than surfing, be sure to:  Pack a cooler and drive the entire back road to Hana.  It's an asshole clenching drive your first time, but it's unreal gorgeous, and there are ten million empty beaches and waterfalls to check out.  Be sure and stop at Seven Pools.  Bring a decent amount of cash, finding an ATM on the drive can be hard and it costs money (I think $10) to park.  Get the smallest rental car you can.  I did the drive in a Charger and thought I was going to die, did it again in a Spark and had fun making other drivers think they were going to die.  Go to the Surfing Goat Dairy.  Cute goats to play with and really, really, really good goat cheese and goat cheese containing food. If you want to bring some home they'll try to convince you to pay an exorbitant amount to pack and ship it, but the little containers they use are exactly three ounces and will make it through TSA, regardless of what they say.  If you're into spearfishing or hook and line, stop off at Maui Sporting Goods.  It's like Toys R Us for fishing dudes.  Eat at Mama's Fish House if you can get an reservation, and can afford it.  Best seafood on Earth, but not even close to budget conscious.  But it makes sense, because all the fish they serve it caught locally that day, and they give you the full back story.  Like, baked uku caught via spear by Kimo three hours ago type stuff.  Eat at the Paia Fish Market.  So fucking good, and not very expensive, by Hawaii standards.  Which means kind of expensive by mainland standards.  Order three entrees and eat until you both feel sick."
surfing,3e0ue0,dumbassthenes,3,Tue Jul 21 02:35:51 2015 UTC,Do you mean the drive passing Kapalua and Nakalele Blowhole? That's a wild ride. The locals race down those hills and somehow know every nook and cranny. Having said that The entire Road to Hana is so worth it.
surfing,3e0ue0,jj_ped,2,Tue Jul 21 03:57:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's fucking awesome.  I forgot to mention to OP, if you see a non rental (anything witha  plate that does not start with a ""Z"") pull over the first chance you get and let them pass.  It's the polite thing to do."
surfing,3e0ue0,dumbassthenes,4,Tue Jul 21 04:01:15 2015 UTC,"And if you pass a golf course, honk the horn really loud and call them faggots, it's a local Kauai thing I learned."

surfing,3e0ue0,dumbassthenes,7,Tue Jul 21 04:28:29 2015 UTC,"I save the word faggot for the most deplorable, moraly absent people in the human race, those of whom lead a lifestyle that is both wrong in the eyes of myself and Jebus, and should feel nothing but shame for the huge part they play in corrupting our entire glpbal society...........I'm talking of course about rich, white, republican golfers who invade Hawaii with their Mahalo rewards cards. It is 2015, yes, and goddammit that's their word now, a word I'm sure they're more used to expressing through their years of cautious racism, segregation and bigotry instead of being on the receiving end.  So if you see a golfer loading up his white Range Rover to hit a ball in a cup on what was once a grove of untouched natural beauty, you walk right up to him, punch him square in his fat face, open mouth kiss his trophy wife then bend him over, put his head deep within your bussom and you call him a faggot, let him know that's his word now.  Try marching for golfers rights in 2025 asshole, no one fucking cares, burn in hell."

There's a surf shop right across S Kihei Blvd also rents and does lessons and whatnot. I also recommend heading down the road to S & Q's coffee hut and getting a Kona Bean Shake, so delicious."
