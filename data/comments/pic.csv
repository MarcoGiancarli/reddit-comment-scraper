(poor lil guy has a scar. ;-;)  They, like most geckos, have pads on their toes to grip flat surfaces easily (like slippery rain forest leaves.)  Leopard geckos are unique for a few reasons, one of which is that they actually have claws on their toes. They do a bit of digging in the sand and claws are more useful than pads made of tons of tiny hooks.  But actually green day geckos are tickly because of their pads. each toe has tons of microscopic barbs to attach itself to things and stuff. They're so small though that they don't really pierce the skin."

Yes, it was crowded, but honestly, it didn't matter to me, the throng of people was eclipsed by the monument.   The whole walk there is lined with ancient aqueducts, and if you walk passed the Treasury building you can visit an amphitheater. If anyone ever gets a chance to go, bring plenty of water, as they tried to sell me a bottle for $3. Careful for the horse carriages, they barrel around the corners without abandon, but you'll hear the drivers whistling at you to gtfo of the way, it's all the warning you'll get.   I loved it there, it was worth the heat, and long walk. I enjoyed the hike, but I'll warn you that you need to be physically able. I saw a few people collapse on the way back. It's walking in sand for most of the way so it's tougher for some than it looks.   I uploaded some pictures from my tip in case anyone is interested.  It's definitely possible for you to visit Petra when it's not so crowded. It's just going to take some extra planning so that your trip doesn't coincide with all of the cruise ships being in port as this is what brings in the throng of people."

Petra was by far the best (Valley of the Kings a near second). I think because you have to work for it, and the size of the place."

pic,3dkcq4,flappytowel,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:39:54 2015 UTC,"The Dresden Frauenkirche (German: Dresdner Frauenkirche, Church of Our Lady) is a Lutheran church in Dresden, the capital of the German state of Saxony. Although the original church was Roman Catholic until it became Protestant during the Reformation, the current Baroque building was purposely built Protestant. It is considered an outstanding example of Protestant sacred architecture, featuring one of the largest domes in Europe. It now also serves as a symbol of reconciliation between former warring enemies.  Built in the 18th century, the church was destroyed in the bombing of Dresden during World War II. The remaining ruins were left as a war memorial, following decisions of local East German leaders. The church was rebuilt after the reunification of Germany, starting in 1994. The reconstruction of its exterior was completed in 2004, and the interior in 2005. The church was reconsecrated on 30 October 2005 with festive services lasting through the Protestant observance of Reformation Day on 31 October. The surrounding Neumarkt square with its many valuable baroque buildings was also reconstructed in 2004.  The Frauenkirche is often called a cathedral, however it is not the seat of a bishop. The bishop's church is the Church of the Cross. Once a month, an Anglican Evensong is held in English, by clergy from the St. George's Anglican Chaplaincy."
