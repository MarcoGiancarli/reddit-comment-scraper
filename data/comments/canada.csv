The study did not include all of the countries in the world. High income European countries in particular were excluded.   (As economics professor Anke Kessler of Simon Fraser University pointed out, the current numbers did not take into account countries that have traditionally been ahead of Canada, such as Norway, Switzerland and Luxembourg. Indeed, according to one of the researchers involved in the study, Luxembourg is higher.)   So what the study really said was ""Canada had middle class incomes comparable to the US in 2010""."

In the same period, earners in the third quintile — a segment that could be slotted within the middle class — took in $39,900 in 2011, up 3.9 per cent.

canada,3e21w4,Knibb_High_Football,6,Tue Jul 21 14:47:22 2015 UTC,"The primary argument is that the middle class has seen limited income growth over the last 20-30 years compared to the top end (1-5%).

canada,3e21w4,wotoan,2,Tue Jul 21 14:56:29 2015 UTC,"But that is exactly what ""median"" defines:   Median: denoting or relating to a value or quantity lying at the midpoint of a frequency distribution of observed values or quantities, such that there is an equal probability of falling above or below it.   So if you had 2 millionaires, and 2 homeless people, the median income would be $500,000.  That's an intellectually dishonest way of describing the middle class as earning $500,000"
canada,3e21w4,beeberness,8,Tue Jul 21 13:38:07 2015 UTC,"You're looking for the mean, whereas the median value is what is being discussed   Median means the middle value of the middle datapoint that occurs within a group.  The median is a more important measure, especially for income inequality. If there is a group of millionaires and a group of poor folks, you can imagine a two-humped camel type of graph (x axis is range of money, y axis is number of people). This is a bimodal distribution.  http://abovethelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/bimodal2000.jpg  In this case the mean would be an unrepresentative value in the chasm between the two humps (an unlikely individual). However, the median value is more likely to describe an individual that exists because the median value is actually a datapoint instead of an average (mean) of all points.  Put simply if you made $100k for 2 years, $75k for one year, $30k for 1 year, $25k for 2 years, and $0k for one year, your median income would be $30k. Your mean income would be $50.7k.  Now, given a dataset with many people that doesn't look like a perfect bell shape, (or perfectly symmetrical), the median and mean will be different. In a dataset with few datapoints about the middle of the x axis range, the median will be a better measure because it literally is the middle datapoint.  This is especially true for income inequality."

So we've taken at least a 30% haircut on that metric. Not sure if you noticed but our currency has taken a bit of a nosedive lately. Not to mention our economy is in decline (recession) so Canadians have fallen even further behind this year.   The findings show that median per-capita income in Canada, after tax, matched that of the Americans in 2010 at $18,700 (U.S.), However, as the report noted, it has probably increased since.   Yeah it's fair to say this article is out of date.   Note: Actually nvm, I think Conservatives should continue using this metric and bringing up this study. So we can all see how far behind the Harper Conservatives have put Canadians on the income ladder as compared to other countries.   Note 2: Toned it down a little bit.

Will you please be honest and admit that?   That has nothing to do with the original argument. the fact is that plunging dollar is not entirely Canada's fault and is more due to the surging strength of the greenback.  It's the same reason it was so high a few years back - had little to do with Canada and more to do with the weakness of the US.

canada,3e21w4,ybx,7,Tue Jul 21 15:55:39 2015 UTC,The middle class is what makes countries strong.

Last year, as a percent of GDP, we invested 20% less than we did ten years ago in 2004 (our peak spending year and coincidentally, the last year of a Liberal majority), while the rest of the OECD countries invested an average of 31% more over the same time span.

I don't care about the truth or decency and I have no values that I will not submit to our political marketing.   If that's not truth in advertising I don't know what is. You want to make a big difference in Canada? Make sure that the people who pay for those ads are known. Lets get the people who bankroll this nonsense on the radar, in the area of public discussion and see what happens. Let's ban political parties from attempting to influence or manage online discussion without the same 'brought to you by the X party of canada' that we would expect from TV.   Lets put the onus on the parties to actually show some inclination about acting better then a mix between kindergarden children and a particular inept branch of a gang or mafia.

Neither is it possible to say this is a new development and evidence of the debasement of our political system by the Conservatives. CPC is guilty of many crummy things in my books, but ruining our electoral system with ad hominem attacks is not one of them.  Hard-fought elections are a good thing - they mean that your vote is worth something. People competing hard will work the edges of the rules. Negative campaigning was banned at the time of the eruptions in Pompeii, so candidates resorted to cheeky graffiti to get their point across.  It is very difficult to make elections more genteel and collegial without harming people's ability to effectively campaign for the ideas they believe in.  EDIT: One more historical resource to add.

You quitting the party because he didn't get elected doesn't make you a Liberal and I don't think you're the type that belongs I. This party anyway.

Oh, you think Trudeau makes stupid statements in public? Like when the Conservatives ripped him apart for making a very real statement about terrorism, which was later echoed by the Commander of NATO?  Or when they twisted his statement about fairness not necessarily meaning everyone gets the same?   The guy has been making real statements, and speaking a little more candidly than we're used to, so of course the Tories have bought into that to rally their base. He's being branded as some naive, impotent little child because he a) has attempted to go beyond the same old rhetoric that plagues politics, and b) looks young.  If your reasoning for disliking the guy isn't based on anything better than that, you're ""just not ready"" to be voting.  I myself am disappointed with him for not sticking to his principles, but I do understand why he waivered on C-51. Because when he made the responsible statement after the Boston bombing, about not jumping to vitriolic rage and trying to understand the causes of terrorism rather than simply calling for blood, he was lambasted by the Conservatives and Canadians didn't stand up and go, ""hey, he has a point.""

Reading the report, it looks like Canada scores middle-ish in most categories, getting slightly higher marks in appeals, sanctions and promotional materials, but lower marks in right to access, scope, procedures, and the number of exceptions. The report also says:   As a country that was once among the world's leaders in government openness, it is unfortunate that Canada has dropped so far down the list. Partly, this is the result of global progress, with which Canada has failed to keep pace. Canada's Access to Information Act, while cutting edge in 1983, has not been significantly updated since then, and reflects many outdated norms. Canada's lax timelines, imposition of access fees, lack of a proper public interest override, and blanket exemptions for certain political offices all contravene international standards for the right of access. Canada's antiquated approach to access to information is also the result of a lack of political will to improve the situation. Since the Access to Information Act was first passed there have been several attempts to reform and revamp it, and all have been defeated in one way or another. We hope that Canada's poor showing here will be a wake up call to the fact that global standards for implementation of the right to information have moved past what the Access to Information Act can provide, and will spur our politicians to act in order to give proper implementation to the right to information.   Basically ""Yeah, it was great in 1983, but what have you done for us lately"".  Also, I know people who do ATIP requests (I don't personally; also this could be different for different areas). They are understaffed, everything goes through a ridiculous amount of censoring, and as soon as you go over the time limit for a request, it gets put on the back burner (because who cares, you're already in violation of the agreement, better to keep that rate low)."

You really wouldn't care if the overall good drops as long as you have more.

GGM-FEE tends to lock up capital and reduce the overall size of the pool available to generate more capital.  Everyone Gotta Get Theirs (EGGT), a WIN-WIN scenario, is going to produce better results for everyone, including the self-centered among the population, as it tends to increase the overall pool of capital over time faster than if it is locked up by those who GGM-FEE their way to the top.

It take persistent and assertive action to deliver even some of the most basic information - we have even had to fight to provide public education on what to do in case of severe weather!

When has our media ever been a shining example to the world for putting out content that truly goes against the grain? Chomsky summed it up well and he made his statements well before ""dear leader"" came to power. Canadian media will always avoid criticism of our actions, especially on an international level regardless of their merit. Everyone wants to make it about some big omnipotent authority that oppresses us and maybe that's why we have the government we have. We need ""the bad guy"" because that's what we expect/want.  We want a government that gets things done, and makes Canada good for business. If Canadians really felt our country was going off the rails due to some irresponsible governing we would've elected a party that could be a sacrificial lamb. Harper's government doesn't want to be embroiled in endless media bs, or people endlessly nitpicking their policies without fully understanding the compromises that drive them.  The media = corporations, they are corporations that want your money, your emotions, they make their money by you giving a fuck and they'll do whatever it takes to earn that next ad dollar. So give power to whoever you want to give power to but I would rather the people who spent their lives learning how to effectively rule be given that authority than a bunch ""media experts"" whose responsibility it is to create ""the next big story"" at the expense of effective governance of a country. I mean look what just happened in Greece, Syriza handed ""power to the people"" by letting them vote in some meaningless referendum that ultimately went down as being meaningless because as long as the Greeks wanted to stay in the Euro they can't write off more debt (not to get side-tracked but I mean these things show limits of average bystanders at controlling major issues). What exactly are we missing out that we would act on, other than get some bitchy articles show up front page screaming scandal, a couple supreme court hearings, a couple of ""public executions"" then what, everybody gets to inject their folksy wisdom and ""common sense"" into political discourse?  Instead of just following the standard media narrative and assuming we live in the next Nazi Germany. Start reading people who have spent their lives studying the media (Chomsky is a good start) and start gleaning insight from their analyses of events and make arguments that are outside of the narrative, like ""why should this matter?""."

It's not the fault of Canadians that the media doesn't provide more insightful stories for us to read. But that doesn't mean there is no desire for this.   The Harper government can not want people ""endlessly nitpicking their policies without fully understanding the compromises that drive them"" all it wants. That isn't a very good excuse for democracy and by all accounts, while I would agree that media literacy in this nation is pretty low, it is hardly going to get better with a government whose main priority is to avoid answering questions because it believes it has a higher cause than that."

canada,3e2kbi,nimobo,3,Tue Jul 21 13:48:11 2015 UTC,"Speaking of restrictive voting laws, the Conservatives just re-disenfranchised more than a million Canadians. Yesterday the Ontario Court of Appeal reversed an earlier Ontario Superior Court ruling that had restored voting rights of many expats. Those charter rights had been denied since 2007, when the Harper government adopted a dubiously-harsh interpretation of a 1993 law (so the Liberals were partly to blame, too).  We (expats) had our federal voting rights restored in May 2014, by which point the Conservatives had spent over $1.3M of taxpayer money fighting to suppress our rights. I don't even know how much more they spent on the appeal, or why (other than their seeming general disdain for our democracy and for so may other things about our country that I hold dear).  The argument is supposedly that we don't have a strong connection to Canada and its politics don't affect us. Well, I can tell you, I feel pretty damn affected by the removal of one of my charter rights, and even though I'm living in the US, I am a Canadian and only a Canadian, and I care very much about what happens to my country; I have family and friends there, I visit fairly regularly, and I plan to return, and the government while I'm away will have a real impact on what kind of country I'll be returning to.  Further, only about 6,000 of the 1M+ expats actually vote. Pretty sure it's self-selected as the people who have strong connections to the country, good awareness of the politics of the day, and mostly who want to return. If the effect of our votes weren't as important to us (those 6,000) as to other Canadians, as they've argued, then why would we be going to the trouble of voting in the first place, when so many resident Canadians don't bother?

No, it won't, because inflation will ultimately force you to eat through the principle. Say you earned 7% every year on that 750K (that's 52.5K each year, a comfortable living) and lived off the interest income without touching the principal. At 2% inflation, 20 years from now, that 52.5K would be worth the equivalent of a 35K salary today. 40 years from now it would be worth the equivalent of a 23K salary today. So obviously you'd need to dip into the principal to maintain a middle-class lifestyle."
canada,3e11nh,shma_,-2,Tue Jul 21 13:57:28 2015 UTC,"No, it won't, because inflation will ultimately force you to eat through the principle   You are partially correct, but most blue-chip, dividend-paying companies increase their dividends at at least (and often significantly more than) the rate of inflation each year.  Also, don't forget the principal itself will grow over time, so as long as you are drawing down an amount less than or equal to that growth you will never run out."

By definition, the principal will not grow if you are taking out all the profits as investment income, which is what you'd have to do to earn 50K in the first year. If you only take out, say, 5/7 of the interest income so your principal grows with inflation, you're earning maybe 35K a year in perpetuity, which is not exactly a comfortable retirement.  750K is not enough money to quit your job and retire."
canada,3e11nh,shma_,4,Tue Jul 21 14:28:48 2015 UTC,"By definition, the principal will not grow if you are taking out all the profits as investment income,   That's why you don't take out all the profilts as investment income.  There are two main ways to profit in stock market investing: dividends (which are like interest, only better) and capital (principal) growth.  Good stocks are ones that provide both.  For example, I own Scotiabank stock (among others).   The entire time that I have owned it, I have been paid a quarterly cash dividend, which has grown to $0.68 per share, which means that I am earning a yield of 4.1% on today's price.  This dividend payment is independent of any growth in the share price itself...  ...which brings me to the part that went over your head: I have owned the stock for years, with an average price per share of $46 (it's trading at around $63 now.)  As you can see, the principal has also grown dramatically, so I could even take profits by selling some shares and I still would not have dipped into the originally-invested amount.  If I put $750K into a basket of quality dividend growth stocks (the banks, telcos, pipelines) and received a 4% yield, I'd receive around $30K in dividends each year.  I would not need to sell any of the stock itself, and as such the principal would continue to grow while I lived off the dividends.  Companies tend to increase their dividends each year, at a rate higher than inflation, so the dividend income alone keeps up with it."

Nothing went over my head, you just feel like arguing against straw men instead of reading what I wrote or what I was responding to."

I live in B.C. and haven't followed the situation in Ontario, so I don't have much to say about that.  Yours is a bad comparison. Household debt is unlike government debt in two important respects: 1) Government spending stimulates the economy. Household debt seldom stimulates household income. 2) Sovereign governments can never actually run out of money, because they can always print more. This incurs costs (inflation), but it's not like becoming bankrupt upon hitting a debt wall. Greece used to do this. The reason their problems there are so bad is that, as a member of the Euro zone, they no longer can.  In the case of Ontario, 1) the debt incurred corresponds with economic activity (which may be less efficient than otherwise, but it's not a total loss). 2) While Ontario is not a sovereign state, unlike Greece in Europe it is in a fiscal and political union with the rest of Canada.

It could be far better or far worse   I do know that, because the situations are fundamentally different. Even if the Ontario situation were worse, it would have to be worse in different ways. Ontario is nothing like Greece.  Were Greece to exit the Euro, it is faced with a situation where there is no money (no Euros, and no capacity to print its own in the near future or to institute electronic payment systems). Even with healthy businesses the economy simply could not function without money. Lacking cash to pay for food imports the people would literally starve. They could only be saved by international aid.  This cannot happen to Ontario. Even if the province went bankrupt, the federal government would still be providing transfers and spending money in the province. This guarantees a baseline of economic activity and a flow of money. Unlike Greece, Ontario cannot face a situation in which there is literally no money.  Ok, I suppose you could hypothetically cook up a scenario in which the federal government somehow withdrew all spending from Ontario, but it's about as likely as rewriting Canada's constitution to make us Europe. Decisions about how the federal government should respond (including the possibility of quantitative easing) would be taken by parliamentary representatives elected in part by residents of Ontario. This is not the case in Greece: German politicians, responsive only to German voters, are making the key decisions. Moreover, the feds could make that decision without permission from the provinces, and without going through provincial parliaments: unlike in Europe, where consensus among member states is required. With its political clout, there is zero chance that Ontario would be treated as Greece has been.  None of what I am saying is a defence of Ontario: as I said, I don't live there and haven't followed the matter.

The lying/criminal cover ups over the gas plant, the dodging of any relevant questions, and the lack of will to actually tackle the shit sandwich called our piling debt, or energy policy or transit, or keeping drive clean and generating revenue off of it when one of it's mandates is being revenue neutral, the LCBO and it's need to generate revenue, but ALSO be our nanny...

The gas plant issue was completely legal, the only thing they did wrong was delete emails about it and low-ball the cost, and even then, every party promised the same thing, so when you tout it as a Liberal waste of money, remember that this promise was made by Hudak and Horvath. As a criticism of the party, they could've saved ~10% or less of that cost by being harder on the contracts, but the brunt of that cost was going to happen regardless. That it became such a big issue is a testament to the shallowness of the PC party.    dodging of relevant questions   Anecdotal example, or do you have particular concerns?   lack of will to actually tackle our piling debt   Uhh...But they are. They have a wage freeze. They are attempting to reduce the deficit and have cut spending. If you cut spending too quickly, you can damage the economy beyond the benefits of reduced spending.   drive clean and the LCBO   These issues are both tangential to what we're talking about and not that substantial.   but ALSO be our nanny   I wish you would've put this first, it could've served as a warning to not read the rest of your post.

This article contains a short list of controversies to which she's given no real answers.  You discount the LCBO and drive clean, however - they're legitimate complaints that fall under provincial jurisdiction and make living here shittier. Is everything down to finance? No. They add to the dissatisfaction of the people in this province.  A wage freeze is nice and well, but doesn't help to grow or unfuck our economy, damaged by mismanagement over the last decade."

The issue here isn't that what they did was wrong, it was that they panicked and lied about it. The $1 billion gas plant scandal isn't what is being investigated, it's deleting of email communications. The PCs would love for the people of Ontario to think the government illegally defrauded the people of a billion dollars, but that's not the case.   This article contains a short list of controversies to which she's given no real answers.   No actually, it doesn't. The AMA was bad, I remember that. It was poorly done. But I've seen Wynne answer controversial questions so I'm skeptical of what exactly she's dodging. That sounds like the rhetoric one of my local MPPs is constantly barking about.   A wage freeze is nice and well, but doesn't help to grow or unfuck our economy, damaged by mismanagement over the last decade.   A wage freeze is a spending cut. A spending cut is meant to alleviate the deficit. The deficit and the debt have virtually nothing to do with our economic success or failure at this point, thus actions taken to relieve our deficit by any method other than growth will not 'unfuck' the economy.   Furthermore, our economy was not damaged by mismanagement over the past decade. Our economy was dealt a devastating blow by NAFTA. Prior to that, we had protections in place between Canada and the US which allowed us a semblance of control over what was made and sold here. We were a manufacturing economy, and being from a place with a high quality of life, free trade is not our friend. That was set in motion long before the Ontario Liberals took office. Each time there is disruption in the economy (early 2000s, mid 1990s, late 2000s) business leaves for cheaper places in large quantities.   Ontario's economy is actually doing alright at the moment, and has been for much of the last decade and more. This 'damaged by mismanagement' displays a lack of understanding of both the economy and government's role in managing it."

As far as the economy - several factors, both external and induced have hurt the manufacturing industry. Our demented energy policy certainly hasn't helped. Kitchener is a success story, but then the Niagara region is a flop.

I've worked in politics in Ontario for decades and the questions you're posing don't even scratch the surface of how people think when they vote or form their political opinions.  You compare Germany and Greece, intimating that Germany's success is due to austerity, as if their economy isn't entirely different. Is Germany austere? They have free education, strong apprenticeships and retraining, some of the best infrastructure in the world, regional diversity, teamwork culture, on and on.  Your final choice doesn't present a downside, (fiscal discipline?), but you seem to be suggesting that those against austerity are voting selfishly for handouts. That's an old line that doesn't add up to much. What are these comfortable handouts? Welfare? Free homes? No. Schools, hospitals, transit?   About half of lower income folks vote conservative, some of them for the promise of tax cuts and the jobs they will bring. Where does that fit in your choice?  Ultimately, the difference between ""what people deserve"" and ""what can be provided"" isn't as obvious as you suggest, nor related to income or party.

No credible account of California's finances would put their debt at half of ours. That's laughable. Honest estimate, they are about double ours.      Keep in mind, California does not handle nearly as many programs as Ontario does. Medicaid and Medicare are federal programs in the US, for example. OHIP is all Ontario. The California government has annual revenue of $115 billion. Ontario is $120 bilion. Put another way, the Ontario government is about the same size as the California government.      Realistic estimates for California debt are closer to $600 billion, with some estimates above $1 Trillion. But nobody knows, because they have been making mince meat of the law because they need a public vote to run a deficit.       We spent $150 billion to shield Ontario from the great recession, and it worked. Our deficits have shrunk dramatically, and nobody got hurt. In California, they had tent cities and violent clashes with the police. Many people there are living in third world conditions.     Don't compare Ontario to California."

As Tim Hudak tried in Ontario, it will be a political disaster. People will come at you with their pitchforks.   It sounds nice in theory, but in practice, there is too much politics involved to make it work. The same argument applies with the legalization of drugs/marijuana.

These people have mortgage payments and wouldn't be able to make ends meet.  No government is going to fire this many public sector employees (even if they are no longer needed).   We cannot maintain an ill-functioning economic system just to preserve jobs.   But, we do. Take a look at the auto industry and any industry that gets government subsidies, including walmart & no-benefits mcjobs that pass-on healthcare/social costs onto the province by employing people below poverty line.  We subsidize oil/mining industries because the cost of environmental pollution is passed on. We inflate the financial sector & housing by artificially keeping interest rates low. We subsidize education, healthcare, northern jobs, youth employment & research industry... Things aren't as straight-forward as they seem.  You see, we do maintain ill-functioning economic systems just to preserve the status quo. Although I don't think we will become Greece anytime soon, why do you think Greece did not take a radical approach and default on their loans? Because it is uncertain & unpopular. Not only is it political suicide and a big risk, there is a chance that you will screw up and not be able to restructure your economy. They therefore opt to continue on their trajectory, and will not cut their excess spending (ie bloated public sector and pensions that are more than what Germans get)."

I mean many countries have utilized the printing of money to pay off substantial debts but it onto itself is not a proper way to resolve yourself of debt.   It's very interesting as in the interwar period in Europe we see that England, France and Germany all utilized the printing of money to various degrees, with Germany printing off the most(oaying for most of there war debts this way, but with the added cost of inflation), France printing roughly half, (they utilized bonds to pay for the war), and England printing the least utilizing both increased taxes, priniting of money(to the slightest degree) and borrowing from the Americans.   Basically what I am saying if they said let's pay off every single dollar of Canadian debt, that would be stupid, incite hyperinflation, Nationalism, and other issues, but if they said let's print a little bit more money, and raise taxes, and raise money other ways than that would be fine. I think it's a bit too broad to just say it's pseudofinace.   Source: Graduate of Political Economy at MIT"

Government control over the money supply hurts the poor more so than any other group, specifically because of the inflation that the excess printing and monopoly over the supply gives you. The government can help one favourite group sidestep most of the effects by giving them the printed money first. By the time it finally circulates, the last to feel the effects (the poor, the middle class) are the ones who feel it the most and can least afford to deal with it.   You seem to think the solution is government intervention with mincome... But the government is at root of the problem. Excluding those who could otherwise take part in the system, and then forcing them to go on welfare paid for by those who are/able to be productive. More government heroin (mincome) only teaches more dependence on government. It doesn't solve anything, it just makes the system worse. As long as you can keep the majority happy by paying them off at the expense of the minority of course you're going to say government programs and intervention ""work"" because it masks the real slide into one of three things we've already seen in history...

If everyone demands their own money back and the bank can't pay up, that's somehow ok? Is someone allowed to use your credit card as you so long as they lay the bill at the end of the 21 days?

Any of the top 50-150 male ATP players would beat her 9.5 out of 10 times, there are huge differences in the sport.   The average serve for at the 2015 Wimbledon Finals for a Female(I saw the stat during a Semi-Final game) was 94MPH while the males was 124MPH. That's a huge difference, the fastest ever female serve was 131 while the males fastest serve was 163MPH, Cilic, Groth, Karlovic, Raonic, and Roddick all of those players average first serve is above 124MPH. Females play best to 2 sets and men play best to 3 sets It was tested in Battle of the sexes tennis game where Bobby Riggs(Former number 1) at age 55 played 30 year old Margrett Court(Ranked 1 at the time) and she lost in straight sets. Note he latter played King age 26 who beat him at age 56,(He couldn't get any drop shots, but still forced a 3rd set.) Serrnia said in 1998 at the age of 16 that she could beat and male under 200, Karsten Braash responded ranked 203 that he would play her, and she accepted and lost (6,1 6,1)(Note: She won the US open in 1999). Venus then challenged him and lost (6,2)(6,2).   Baraash said he played like a 600th ranked player to keep the game fun.  Also the whole Female World Cup players should be paid the same is total BS in my opinion for two reasons   The Female World Cup was projected to bring in 26M viewers while the Male World Cup brought in 800M-1B people(Note: That some countries don't have good reporting standards so the numbers are off.) The Female World Cup brought in $40M Ad revenue while the 2015 male World Cup brought in $4B which is 100x more and thats why the Mens side is paid more.   In my opinion its insulting to women to pay them the same as the male tournament if they didn't earn it.  If they want the same tournament winnings they should be advocating for a single tournament not two different tournaments. The same with Tennis if you want to compare Serrna to the male version you should be pushing for a single tournament.  http://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeozanian/2014/06/05/the-billion-dollar-business-of-the-world-cup/"

canada,3e0sgm,A_Loki_In_Your_Mind,13,Tue Jul 21 03:18:31 2015 UTC,That seems like a stretch. Was there any examples given in the Senate report on how Netflix and YouTube are competing with the CBC?
canada,3e0sgm,the_gd_donkey,6,Tue Jul 21 16:23:52 2015 UTC,"Make no mistake, this is not a restructuring, this is a death blow.  The two issues brought up were fixed almost immediately by CBC. The main criticism is that they ""didn't create effective policy to prevent the issues from happening"". Of course, how dare the CBC allow mistakes to happen.  The CPC are using these issues to cut one of the few neutral news sources in this country. The shell that will remain will no longer be politically neutral but will be under control of the standing government. This is completely unacceptable in any functioning democracy."
canada,3e0sgm,A_Loki_In_Your_Mind,2,Tue Jul 21 02:39:10 2015 UTC,"I absolutely believe that the news portion of the CBC should be covered and well funded indefinitely. In terms of the CBC other programming however, some need to get public donations for example could be to the long term benefit of the CBC.   NPR for example does wonderfully being both privately and publicly funded, and the need to seek donations helps drive programming in a way that it couldn't if it was fully funded.   I donate to WNYC, WBEZ, Radiotopia and others and I would happily donate to the CBC is they developed programming I actually consumed."
canada,3e0sgm,Surf_Science,2,Tue Jul 21 04:19:16 2015 UTC,Have you listened to Spark before? It astounds me the upcoming technology they find. Almost all of it is stuff that goes under even reddits radar.  I agree though. Vancouver Coop Radio exists purely on donations. It can be done.
canada,3e0sgm,A_Loki_In_Your_Mind,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:23:04 2015 UTC,Nope but I'm setting it to download now. Thanks for the recommendation!
canada,3e0sgm,Surf_Science,-5,Tue Jul 21 04:29:16 2015 UTC,"Same, looks pretty cool. Never heard of it before!"
canada,3e0sgm,JP4R,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:35:15 2015 UTC,"The CBC isn't neutral, they lean blatantly to the left.  That isn't even counting the bullshit politically correct everyone-is-a-victim specials they do."
canada,3e0sgm,Echochamber52,9,Tue Jul 21 07:54:24 2015 UTC,"What ""everyone is a victim"" specials???"
canada,3e0sgm,JP4R,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:35:45 2015 UTC,"Senate...Senate.  Oh, that rat-king of Conservative criminals?  Who cares what they report."
canada,3e0sgm,Baryshnikov_Rifle,3,Tue Jul 21 02:47:32 2015 UTC,Rat-Kings are creepy.
canada,3e0sgm,iwasnotarobot,2,Tue Jul 21 05:24:17 2015 UTC,The Senate should write a Senate report about the Senate. If done properly it would also call for new revenue sources and greater transparency....
canada,3e0sgm,InexcusablyAngry,3,Tue Jul 21 12:41:38 2015 UTC,The CBC is in an industry that is also slowly dying. The future is the Netflix and other online instant access models. Many younger people do not even own a TV. If the CBC is to survive they will need to make a significant transition or they will become irrelevant. Throwing taxpayer money at this is not a long term solution.
canada,3e0sgm,tinfoldedagain,2,Tue Jul 21 12:37:47 2015 UTC,"Not disagreeing with your comments on broadcast media, but IMHO there's tremendous public value in having the CBC exist."
canada,3e0sgm,billthomson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:25:49 2015 UTC,Here's an idea. Don't appoint people with no broadcasting experience as CEO's.
canada,3e0sgm,walker2238,-9,Tue Jul 21 17:30:08 2015 UTC,"The Conservative assault on the CBC continues. Harper is more afraid of the media than he is of the opposition, since with a neutered media he can shamelessly smear opposition candidates. The readers here may be able to separate fact from fiction, but for the average voter the smears will work."
canada,3e0sgm,billthomson,10,Tue Jul 21 13:06:27 2015 UTC,The Reformers now under the banner of Conservatives have had it out for the CBC since their formation.
canada,3e0sgm,Kickatthedarkness,4,Tue Jul 21 14:28:02 2015 UTC,A billion dollars a year goes to the CBC.  It should be privatized.
canada,3e0sgm,AdiposeFin,-4,Tue Jul 21 03:52:32 2015 UTC,The British taxpayer pays the BBC 124 dollars a year.  The French taxpayer pays France Télévisions 77 dollars a year.  The Canadian taxpayer pays the CBC 34 dollars a year.  We actually have quite the steal. CBC staff are underpaid compared to the global average for national broadcaster employees. We should take advantage of them for as long as we can before they start going on strike.
