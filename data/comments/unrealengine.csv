He said his biggest annoyance with UE4 right now is the lack of C++ tutorials that actually explain what they are doing with the code.  I think a tutorial series that is like a C++ version of this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZlv_N0_O1ga0IoRrpI4xkX4qmCrhGu56  Would be really helpful to ALOT of people.
unrealengine,3e2nnr,zeetu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:51:33 2015 UTC,"I suggest reading a couple of good C++ books before diving into UE4 C++. If the people doing the tutorials have to explain every function in depth the tutorial itself will become large and cumbersome for people looking to ""jump in"".  These books on C++ are really good:  http://www.cprogramming.com/c++book/?inl=nua  http://www.stroustrup.com/4th.html"
unrealengine,3e2nnr,datan0ir,4,Tue Jul 21 16:06:58 2015 UTC,The feedback he gave me was that all the UE C++ tutorials were more like: Here is the code to do this one thing and didn't explain why they wrote it that way. He wasn't asking for what each specific function did.  I find the BP tutorials actually explain why they are building the BPs in the way they are.
unrealengine,3e2nnr,zeetu,2,Tue Jul 21 16:11:51 2015 UTC,"Personally I like BPs, and I use them in projects that I help out on.  They seemed to be frowned upon, and they are NOT optimal for anything that is going out to be released. Due to the slowness of them and having to compile them to c++ then to the byte code takes longer time.  That being said, they allow non-programmers to be able to write some temporary code.  To at least get their idea in there and say I made this thing and I know how it works; lets finalize it and move it to code. Blueprints allow artists and such to mess with code without having to dig into the core. It also allows for incredibly quick iterations of code sections, without having to compile the whole project again."
unrealengine,3e2nnr,noisestorm,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:30:05 2015 UTC,Not AS optimal but still perfectly usable for something being released- the only time you'd actually notice them being slower than code or causing a performance hit is with many huge complex blueprints running at once- for any kind of simple/basic projects the difference is so small you wouldn't know if it was using code or BP if you played a packaged game. It really depends on what kind of game is being made.

unrealengine,3e1sm7,Sendatsu_Yoshimitsu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:18:12 2015 UTC,"Just doing it via debuffs sounds like the best option.   Depending on how many buffs you have and how complex your calculations become I would however recommend that you might not look at every buff / debuff every time the card does something but rather apply the buffs to your card variables and store all effects sorted by how much longer they will hold in an array.   You can then check each time they might be modified if the first item in the list is run out and do that as long as the next item run out or as long as there are effects on the list.  If a effect ran out you just apply it's original value negative to the base values.   (depending on the effects you want to introduce you might not only need to modify variables but also to make your card do something different in certain situations. This would probably work best via a event dispatcher where your buff / debuff implements a listener for a dispatcher (e.g. Attack) and then does something before that action is executed. If that's timed as well the add and remove listener are your ""variables"" which the effect modifies.   The reason for a setup like this is simple. You don't iterate all the time through all effects for every card.   If there never will be a lot of effects this might not matter and it can be viable to just iterate through everything which certainly is faster to code."
unrealengine,3e1sm7,Erasio,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:15:25 2015 UTC,"This is definitely a lot more elegant than my original solution, but I'm still missing something fundamental- let's say every card has three values that can be buffed/debuffed, an int Effectiveness and two floats Attack and Defense. When I write my buffs/debuffs, how would I actually indicate which value I wanted them to change? Would I have a unique method for each card value and express each debuff as a delegate pointing at ChangeAttack(float amount), ChangeDefense(float amount) and so forth? That still seems slightly unwieldy."
unrealengine,3e1sm7,Erasio,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:23:35 2015 UTC,"I would do that via actor components. Just create a component buff with sub classes for everything. In there you can change the variables of owner and to apply them just add a component which you can create in any other class. Anything that should be able to receive a buff gets an interface ""add buff"" which adds it to the array and runs the function within the component."
unrealengine,3e1sm7,Erasio,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:04:54 2015 UTC,"Oh that's smart... so in our imaginary example with three things to be modified (Attack, Defense, Effectiveness), you would have some BuffManager component that all buffable objects get, whose only job is to retain an array of buffs, then three subclasses of BuffBase: BuffAttack, BuffDefense, BuffEffectiveness, all of whom have some common methods ApplyBuff and RemoveBuff which BuffManager is in charge of calling?"
unrealengine,3e1sm7,Erasio,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:38:55 2015 UTC,Yes exactly. Like this it's also easy to implement different types of buff manager which only accept certain buffs / debuffs (e.g. Monster card which allows all but a magic card only effectiveness and damage).
unrealengine,3e1sm7,Erasio,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:31:36 2015 UTC,"How would you handle one card modifying others, like ""As long as this card is in play, any card of Type A has this debuff""? Would you just run a search in that card's ApplyBuff that goes ""Foreach(card that matches our profile){Card.BuffArray.Add(this);}"", then add a sanity check to BuffManager which, on detecting that a pointer in BuffList is null (meaning the card that owns it ha been deleted), it resets its object's stats to default and iterates through BuffList again, to ensure modifiers are up to date?"
unrealengine,3e1sm7,Parad0x_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:04:35 2015 UTC,I would just make it one step easier and always let the effect which applies the buff do the work except for duration effects. This means simply that this card would hold a reference to each component it places on another card (via for each ad you said) and on destruction call the function to reverse the effect (which should by itself delete the component).   Like this you can be sure to always have the same type of applying buffs and nothing is handled in the buff actors except the buff itself.   Order is everything ;)
