xkcd,3dwpe9,auxiliary-character,7,Mon Jul 20 20:47:38 2015 UTC,"Haha, no, they used SSL, although I wouldn't be surprised if their SSL private keys are available now.  They just wanted us to sign requests to show that they ""originated"" from the app. But the signing was beyond useless because you could very easily grab the keys and reverse engineer the algorithm.  The people on the team I worked with were not very competent. The project was a mess and the people were low skilled. They paid me a lot to fix it, and then completely treated me like shit whenever I suggested we fix anything. Eventually I was canned because I kept telling them that the software was unacceptably bad and that we needed to fix it."

xkcd,3dwpe9,auxiliary-character,5,Mon Jul 20 20:53:44 2015 UTC,"One thing that stood out as particularly terrible was how they handled images.  They would give a warning about how much uploading you would do, because maybe it would be 100+ megs of image data you are uploading.  However, in pre-processing the images, they uploaded them twice to the server to get things like width/height back. So that 100mb of transfer would become 300mb of transfer, and you'd only get warned after the 200mb was done.  I tried to explain to them how that opened them to liability and was horrible for the users (it could be huge overage charges on mobile) but they just didn't understand. The person responsible for these huge fuckups is now lead of that team."
xkcd,3dwpe9,HaMMeReD,4,Mon Jul 20 20:57:09 2015 UTC,"A second joke, if I remember my number theory classes right, is that the distinction between public and private keys is arbitrary.  So if you gave out your ""private"" key to everyone but they didn't have your ""public"" key, the results would actually be the same as the more expected case, but people would be more excited about it because they have a ""private"" key."
xkcd,3dwpe9,jfpbookworm,7,Mon Jul 20 15:14:24 2015 UTC,This may be true for RSA but as far as I know this isn't true for ECC (elliptic curve crypto). Here the public key can't be used to encrypt a message only the private key. Which means that ECC is only used in digital signature schemes.
xkcd,3dwpe9,klad1991,6,Mon Jul 20 15:54:37 2015 UTC,"You're correct in that they can both be used to invert the other one. However, you don't want to be giving your private key out, as you can derive the public key from it, so the distinction is important."
xkcd,3dwpe9,jrtc27,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:27:10 2015 UTC,"No.  Assuming that we're talking RSA here, you can't derive the public key without knowing the 2 prime numbers (P and Q).  If we're talking about some other public-key cryptosystem, that may be the case, but RSA public and private keys are  the same thing."
xkcd,3dwpe9,CocoaBotter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:34:53 2015 UTC,"Ok, looks like I was wrong and technically you don't need to store the factors. However, generally speaking the factors are stored inside the private key for current RSA implementations, as well as the entire public key's data; the existence of ""openssl rsa -in private-key.pem -pubout"" shows that you can extract the public key."

xkcd,3dwpe9,CocoaBotter,4,Tue Jul 21 15:47:06 2015 UTC,"Can't you derive the public key from the private key though? If so, it doesn't make sense to invert the keys, since any message encrypted with the private key (or encrypted with the public key to be decrypted with your ""public"" private key) would be easily decrypted by everyone since they could derive your ""private"" public key from your ""public"" private key (yeah, this is confusing)."

There were two options: auto-fill with a credit card, or pay a deposit on the transponder. I chose auto-fill to avoid the deposit.  Every time your account went below $10, it would auto-fill $25. That was a lot for a poor college student. So when I got close to $10, I would manually fill it with $10.  Someone from the EZPass office called and threatened to suspend my account if I did another manual fill because I was in violation of the terms by not allowing the account to auto-fill.  I said, ""There's nothing in the user agreement that says I can't manually fill the account.""  And her response was, ""We don't have to put all the rules in the user agreement."""

xkcd,3cktxl,azoolie,2,Fri Jul 10 22:06:11 2015 UTC,"I think there's something to be said about the author's intent and context. For example, the programing one doesn't really seem sexist to me since I know ahead of time that it's just a gender-swapped comic, but by itself it could seem sexist depending on the source. If it was written by someone else and you had reason to think that the author thought women were poor programmers then you might well conclude that this comic in particular was sexist. But then that raises the question of how you decide whether an author is sexist in the first place and you may not have much else to go on than their body of work. So taking all of that into account, I think that If I saw that comic out of context I would take it as circumstantial evidence that the author is indeed sexist and I think that gives you the best chance of being right."

Are you trying to say reversing it so that a female character is the dumb one and a male character is pointing out how dumb they are makes it sexist, so the original is sexist, too? Because that is not how sexism works. Men are consistently depicted as smart and women as dumb in media, so a comic which shows women as smart and men as dumb isn't ""reverse sexist"" - it's challenging the sexist norm. If it existed in a culture where men and women were depicted equally in media, then maybe it would be sexist, but that isn't the world we live in."

So the issue in my opinion is not that women are portrayed as dumb and men as smart, but that more films feature a male protagonist. And even that to a lesser extent than 10-20 years ago.

xkcd,3cktxl,SHD_lotion,-10,Thu Jul 9 02:33:42 2015 UTC,"I never said anything about comics being the solution to sexism. I was only talking about a couple of Randall's comics, and how they aren't sexist for reversing a stereotype.  Apparently you are still failing to view this in context. We do not live in a society where people of all genders are treated equally. I could give you a laundry list of the ways men are treated better than people of other genders, but we are specifically discussing the correlation between gender and intelligence for characters in books, movies, comics, etc. Male characters are almost always depicted as smarter than female characters and characters of other genders, on the rare occasion they exist in a story. Likewise, token ""smart characters"" like scientists, professors, and lawyers are usually male. We know that men are not biologically smarter than women, but society still treats them as if they were. Our thoughts are influenced by our surroundings, so if everyone is subconsciously taught that men are smart and women are dumb, then media will reflect that (and it does). This is a sexist and wrong idea, so the media that unintentionally perpetuates it is sexist.  Now, what about media that does the opposite? What about media that depicts women as being smarter than men? We know the writer didn't make this media because they were influenced by their surroundings, because the stereotype goes the opposite way. No, they must have decided to do it. Now, is it more likely that the writer decided to do this because they believe women are inherently smarter than men (and if so, where did this idea come from in a patriarchal society?), or is it more likely a response to the sexist stereotype? Maybe the writer thought, ""I'm tired of only seeing smart characters who are male. I'll write a story where all the smart characters are women; that'll help balance the scales."" Or, they decided to give men a taste of their own medicine by reversing the stereotype, and hope that their cries of sexism would provoke self-reflection, and make them realize this is how women feel about every story.  Sure, its meaning changes when you take it out of context, but so does everything else."
xkcd,3cktxl,Wyboth,8,Thu Jul 9 04:35:21 2015 UTC,You could also argue that neither depiction of the comics is sexist because we and the author both know that sex has nothing to do with intelligence.
xkcd,3cktxl,2four,-7,Thu Jul 9 05:27:15 2015 UTC,"But that would be incorrect, because that fails to consider subconscious stereotypes."
xkcd,3cktxl,Wyboth,2,Thu Jul 9 14:09:52 2015 UTC,"So then what's the solution? In order to avoid sexism, women should never be portrayed as ditzy or dumb? Doesn't that create a stereotype in itself, whereby women are never exposed to flawed role models, and depreciate themself because they can never reach the perfection that we portray women in media? Isn't that exactly the kind of thing that people are fighting against (body image, etc.)?"
xkcd,3cktxl,2four,-2,Thu Jul 9 15:26:07 2015 UTC,"Reversing stereotypes does not destroy them; it simply alerts some people to their presence. To destroy the stereotype, one must destroy the sexism that spawned it. Capitalism is a major contributor to sexism, so a proletarian revolution will do wonders for the treatment of women and people of other genders. After that, feminism would be heavily promoted in the media, in schools, etc, so that would erase most of the institutional sexism. Sexism would then only be individual, and that would fade away over time.  In order to not contribute to the stereotype, you should avoid portraying women as ditzy or dumb. This will not create a stereotype of its own, because it is not the status quo, it is a challenge to it. It will never replace the other stereotype as a stereotype of its own, because it is a response to the other one. Does that make sense?"
