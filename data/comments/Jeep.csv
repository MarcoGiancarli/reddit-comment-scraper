Jeep,3e2jfi,xpkranger,17,Tue Jul 21 13:40:04 2015 UTC,The fact that they could remotely kill the brakes is really fucking dangerous. And why is that even possible.
Jeep,3e2jfi,GOA_AMD65,9,Tue Jul 21 14:04:01 2015 UTC,Just wait until they have self driving cars. I'm glad I drive an XJ and don't have electronics controlling everything (there is some of course but nothing exposed to OTA attacks).
Jeep,3e2jfi,aussie_jason,4,Tue Jul 21 14:10:48 2015 UTC,I was thinking the same thing. All my family's cars are not internet facing in any way. Thank goodness for that. I'm surprised Jeep can't push these security updates OTA
Jeep,3e2jfi,xj4me,3,Tue Jul 21 16:36:01 2015 UTC,"Here's a funny thing...OTA upgrades would require access to the vehicle via the cell network that probably doesn't exist.  You know, the same access that these ""hackers"" are claiming.  Attacking the car or upgrading the firmware officially is pretty much the same thing."
Jeep,3e2jfi,calvarez,4,Tue Jul 21 18:59:09 2015 UTC,"I don't know why you're being downvoted for this.  Adding firmware updates via 3G/LTE greatly increases the attack surface, in addition to someone simply hijacking the signal to man-in-the middle it and push through whatever he wants.  Sure, not an issue now if you use up-to-date cryptography, but most people keep their cars for 10+ years, and 10+ year old standards become hackable (i.e. Poodle and Logjam vulnerabilities)."
Jeep,3e2jfi,donjulioanejo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:32:43 2015 UTC,"Good points.  Also a failure would likely mean that the car can't be driven, and can't be re-flashed without physical access.  The dealer really needs to be able to plug into it for this."

Jeep,3e2jfi,FedexSentMeAHead,3,Tue Jul 21 18:26:52 2015 UTC,Was wondering that myself about the brakes.
Jeep,3e2jfi,atomicllama1,3,Tue Jul 21 14:18:24 2015 UTC,Brakes and steering should always be mechanical. If you want to add a motor than can apply the brakes sure.   But my ECU shouldn't be able to stop me from steering or braking.
Jeep,3e2jfi,db295,2,Tue Jul 21 19:03:52 2015 UTC,Traction and stability control use individual braking on the wheels to help control the car.
Jeep,3e2jfi,Apotropaic_Sphinx,2,Tue Jul 21 19:26:57 2015 UTC,"why is that even possible.   Newer cars have electric braking systems that integrate ABS and more advanced traction control (applies brake to one wheel to prevent it from spinning.) So the computer has a lot of control. All a hacker has to do is tell the ABS that the brakes are on full with no wheel spin and the system will cut the brakes, thinking the car is in a skid.  The fact that that system is anywhere near a networking device is absolutely unacceptable. I can't believe the engineers at Fiat/Chrysler would be so stupid."
Jeep,3e2jfi,calvarez,-5,Tue Jul 21 21:05:31 2015 UTC,"It probably isn't.  That article was full of complete lies about many other things, so the entire thing is suspect.  Kind of like the idiot who claimed he could control a plane through the entertainment system."
Jeep,3e2jfi,GOA_AMD65,6,Tue Jul 21 16:42:46 2015 UTC,Its making itself around the news a lot today. It's not fake. Jeep has already issued a patch to fix this. You have to bring your car in for it.
Jeep,3e2jfi,calvarez,-4,Tue Jul 21 17:30:32 2015 UTC,"There are limited parts of the article that aren't fake.  Most of the article is.  And ""issued a fix"" doesn't mean it's a real threat, it means they may have found a POTENTIAL issue and addressed it.  I manage servers that currently have open vulnerabilities, but it's not realistic to exploit them so we leave them alone."
Jeep,3e2jfi,NoShaDow,2,Tue Jul 21 17:47:58 2015 UTC,"Explain to me what exactly is fake about it and why. Additionally, the vehicle is out, it isn't a potential problem, it IS one because someone successfully can make it happen, but rather than be malicious they made it apparent and Jeep issued a fix."
Jeep,3e2jfi,calvarez,-1,Tue Jul 21 18:16:12 2015 UTC,"Potential problems, in network security, are those which would take such a ridiculous amount of effort that they aren't realistic.  Many of the ""OMG vulnerability"" articles you read in mainstream media have ZERO impact on us because they require such ridiculous steps to execute.  Like you could walk up to some of my servers and with some software and specialized knowledge, take over them.  But they are in a locked cabinet, with alarms, inside a huge facility with armed guards and crazy access controls.  So it's a potential problem, but not a realistic problem.  Same could be said about being able to find and attack a car over the cell network.  Here is the most obvious error:  This is a patently false statement that any of us here could go verify by looking at the Jeep site: ""Miller and Valasek say the attack on the entertainment system seems to work on any Chrysler vehicle with Uconnect from late 2013, all of 2014, and early 2015.""  Bull-fucking-shit.  Most of the Uconnect systems have no ability to communicate (no cell radio). There is no two-way Uconnect option for most vehicles; I looked carefully to see if I could get it on my JK, nope. So the ""hackers"" outright lied about that. PLUS then the magazine was grossly negligent in researching the validity of such a bold statement. Therefore the entire article is worthless and not believable."

I am fascinated by the amount that people who have already made up their mind that Jeep has been making a hacker minion-bot fleet since 2013.  The entire article was written with an aura of fear mongering.   While I am highly suspicious of this technology and don't trust Chrysler as as far as I can throw them, they certainly are going to take basic steps to avoid making terrorist life sized RC cars.  Also, while I'm on my soapbox:  Gone are the days of analogue cars.  Gone.  Quit whining about how good things used to be with your death on wheels CJ that turned gas into noise.  New cars will all have more and more connectivity so while reminiscing about easy engine swaps and vacuum diagnosis we gotta realize that new cars are cleaner, safer, more efficient and more comfortable and you can bet they're not going backwards."

If you had a non-cellular connected rental car and hacked it to ""go off"" after 48 hours and if the speedo was > 70 mph, pin the wheel all the way left and stab the brakes, that's a big fucking problem."

Jeep,3e2jfi,calvarez,-6,Tue Jul 21 13:40:48 2015 UTC,FALSE FALSE FALSE.  Period.  One of the many things that shows this article is bullshit.
Jeep,3e2jfi,calvarez,3,Tue Jul 21 17:44:05 2015 UTC,They are making a claim that UConnect is exploitable and has a connection to the CAN network. They've been able to a rewrite firmware on a chip that allows them to remotely send instructions to the control network of the car. They also claim that the technology is similar across other cars of the same manufacturer that it can affect other brands. What about their claim makes it obviously false?
Jeep,3e2jfi,fat_over_lean,3,Tue Jul 21 19:03:36 2015 UTC,"I explained that in another post just a few minutes before you posted, so maybe you missed it.  Read this thread again, basically the hardware for remote access (cell modem) simply doesn't exist in most models."
Jeep,3e2jfi,calvarez,2,Tue Jul 21 19:28:14 2015 UTC,"I'm curious as to how you know that it is false.  Why would they be so specific if they hadn't tested it on several models and found it to work on some and not others.  Again, yes, they could be just lying through their teeth - and I want to say that you could very well be right - but can you please point to one or more specific things in the article where they tell an intentional falsehood?  I am genuinely curious."
Jeep,3e2jfi,fat_over_lean,4,Tue Jul 21 18:36:08 2015 UTC,"Because the hardware to enable two-way communications simply doesn't exist in most models.  It's UNAVAILABLE for the Wrangler, I wanted to get it.  Nope.  The list of models that have the two-way hardware is pretty small.  Unfortunately Chrysler uses the ""Uconnect"" name on both stand-alone and two-way systems.  The two-way version however is ""Uconnect Access.""  The person in the article lied.  And then Wired was grossly negligent by not doing their own research to corroborate such a bold statement."
Jeep,3e2jfi,calvarez,4,Tue Jul 21 18:56:59 2015 UTC,"I see.  Thank you for clarifying.  So, the article appears to be overly broad by not delineating Uconnect vs. Uconncect Access.  It seems like they were able to do something - what we don't know are the details of what and how it was done.  I'd say it's too early to say that the article is 100% bullshit, especially since FCA responded with a patch.  If there was no vulnerability, why issue the patch?  So, while someone hacking your Chrysler vehicle is less likely than Wired might have you believe, it is apparently not impossible given the correct set of circumstances (having the correct model) despite the overstatements within Wired's article."
Jeep,3e2jfi,Aaron_At_Work,2,Tue Jul 21 19:27:38 2015 UTC,"I didn't say the entire article is necessarily WRONG, but the entire thing is suspect and can't be taken as having any value because they outright published several false statements.  Therefore, we simply don't know.  If someone lies to you on one thing, don't you suspect they may lie to you on other things?  Trust...  Patches are often issued on potential but unrealistic vulnerabilities for the same reason we're having a debate here.  If you're not a network guy, you wouldn't understand what's going on with the issue and whether it's a credible real-life threat or not."
Jeep,3e2jfi,Aaron_At_Work,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:44:59 2015 UTC,"Agreed that we need more time for the wheat to be sifted from the chaff.  I think it is telling that FCA issued a patch.  FWIW, I'm quite familiar with patches and vulnerabilities. I manage enterprise patching for about 600 servers.  Yes, there are occasionally patches that we choose not to deploy, mostly because of some problem demonstrated after patching our test servers.  If it is marked as a critical vulnerability though, we make every effort to include it in that month's patching routine, regardless of the likelihood of the use of the vulnerability.  We have to meet certain legal standards as well as client defined standards and to not patch something solely on the basis of whether or not something is likely would subject my organization to risk of legal liability.  Basically, if it's a critical patch - there'd better be a damn good reason (like it breaks stuff) we don't deploy it."

Jeep,3e2jfi,calvarez,4,Tue Jul 21 16:09:09 2015 UTC,Correct. UConnect uses Sprint's network to send data.
Jeep,3e2jfi,xj4me,0,Tue Jul 21 16:17:59 2015 UTC,"Receiver, not transceiver.  Traffic is not two-way.  XM is not two-way.  Nothing in your JK transmits anything."
Jeep,3e2jfi,calvarez,2,Tue Jul 21 16:45:01 2015 UTC,"Not an EE, but doesn't the Sprint connection qualify as a transceiver?  I know the basic difference I (mistakenly) thought the satellite antenna was connected to a transceiver - but by definition, doesn't the the Sprint mobile network connection have to use a transceiver?    ""A transceiver is a device comprising both a transmitter and a receiver which are combined and share common circuitry or a single housing. When no circuitry is common between transmit and receive functions, the device is a transmitter-receiver.""  I'll be the first to admit I have no idea if the mobile phone technology shares the same circuitry, but it would not surprise me if it did."
Jeep,3e2jfi,xj4me,2,Tue Jul 21 16:51:22 2015 UTC,"The JK doesn't have a Sprint transceiver.  That is only on the models that have two-way Uconnect.

Jeep,3e2jfi,calvarez,2,Tue Jul 21 17:00:12 2015 UTC,Cool.  That makes sense.

Jeep,3e36bo,ScubaSteveeeeeeee,2,Tue Jul 21 16:34:55 2015 UTC,"I know this isn't exactly where you are going with this question. However, I've owned the 4.0 in a 1994 YJ, the 3.8 in a 2010 JK, and now the the 3.6 in a 2012 JK. Hands down the 3.6 is the best choice.  My 2010 JK had 37s, 6-speed, 5.13s, and some steel armor. It was a pig up hills. Off-road it was generally fine. It just sucked being in 2nd gear and having to pin the gas to keep up with traffic on the freeway when going up hills."
Jeep,3e36bo,binarypie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:36:28 2015 UTC,"That is actually the insight I was looking for. I would definitely prefer the 3.6 but unfortunately I can't justify spending the money on a 2012+ right now. What did you wheel mostly? Mud, crawling, trail riding?"
Jeep,3e36bo,binarypie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:39:03 2015 UTC,"Trails, like fire roads, and wilderness. Rocks, like the Rubicon. Almost never mud. However, I couldn't see the 3.8 having enough raw power to do well in deep mud."
Jeep,3e36bo,binarypie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:40:43 2015 UTC,I mostly wheel mud so that would be a concern. I guess geared right maybe it would work.
Jeep,3e36bo,Tonellin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:43:32 2015 UTC,"I may be mistaken but mud requires constant power once it gets deep? The 3.8 does ok but expect to gear numerically high and bounce off the rev limiter a fair bit.  I would also worry about the 35s in general and probably the 44s w/o chromoly axels. Depending on how deep the the mud is.  I've haven't done a lot mud except say 6"" or something silly that any stock 4wd would probably be fine in."
Jeep,3e36bo,fulltankofgas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:47:09 2015 UTC,It depends on if you want to blast through like those 500hp mud trucks but torque is important when in mud with a jeep that has sub 200hp. I had 35s on my 2001 with a D44 rear and 30 front and never broke anything but then again that's open diff with 4.56s. I guess it will probably come down to which jeep is a better deal.

The Crown King run is certainly one you should do, for both the fun of the run itself and the destination.  Tip Top Mine is great also."

Jeep,3e030s,calvarez,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:41:23 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of scenic light wheeling all around the lake.  Nothing big, but pretty.  And you can pull up to the lake and swim.  Heading North from there you can do a bunch of trails.  One cool thing about Crown King is that there are bypasses for all the major obstacles.  So you can take newbs or people with less-equipped vehicles without too much headache.  Or just loop the obstacles all you want."
Jeep,3e030s,rbrockett2,2,Tue Jul 21 17:50:01 2015 UTC,Sounds pretty rad. Im gonna have to spend some more time out there. I was thinkin about going the back way into pleasant via bloody basin road..ever been that way?
Jeep,3e030s,calvarez,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:56:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that is FR259 and basically would take you down part of the Crown King trail.  Fairly light wheeling.  More of a trail ride than anything hard core.  The full CK run can offer some rock crawling that significantly challenged my Rubi when it was stock.  But again, with bypasses, and no real danger.  Tip Top mine is accessible in the same area, and is fun.  The full loop is LONG, but you can do in-out in a couple hours."

Jeep,3e2qll,binx42,6,Tue Jul 21 14:39:42 2015 UTC,"Wait... Your jeep gets really hot so your logic is to remove a solid barrier from the sun and replace it with something that will let the sun through? Do you not have air conditioning? There is insulation you can buy for the hard top, I would think that would be a much better solution for your stated problem. I can't recall the name of the company but I think it was like a guy's name or something, a Google for jeep hard top insulation should find it."
Jeep,3e2qll,aussie_jason,3,Tue Jul 21 15:37:51 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  You don't have AC?  And you're going to expose yourself to the sun?!?  I guess if you don't have AC, you would be best off with a bikini top.  That keeps the sun off and leaves everything else open for air flow.  But as noted above there are a couple of ways to help with hardtop heat, assuming you do have AC.  I've used the Hot Heads liners on my previous Jeep, and now have the OEM liners.  Some people also paint the center section of the top, which can't be seen, with white roof coating.  I'm going to do that myself soon.  The liners made a HUGE difference though, and I'm in AZ where they get a real test."

Jeep,3e2qll,CaptGatoroo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:19:27 2015 UTC,"I don't think you will really save any money spending 600ish dollars vs running the a.c. I don't know how much driving you do at highway speeds but you actually burn more fuel without the hard top on at speed. Same goes for open windows down the highway. I personally would look at a hard top liner, it would help keep the inside cooler and also reduces the road noise. Just my 2cents. though I do think those cargo net tops look awesome."
Jeep,3e2qll,LT_lurker,0,Tue Jul 21 19:09:31 2015 UTC,"I do have ac. It just seems more financially practical to roll down the windows and take the top of to allow more air flow than to run the ac. I drive with at least one window open (to pass out mail) for 5-6 hours a day. On average, I turn off my jeep and get out every 20 minutes to deliver a parcel that will not fit in a mail box or acquire a signature."

Jeep,3dy3q7,Aerogriff,2,Mon Jul 20 14:13:25 2015 UTC,Honestly ive been lookin at jeeps and hard top is the way to go. Let me explain why! even on older jeeps like TJs aftermarket Hardtops they are still like $1000+  while soft tops are just a couple hundred (yes they also have expensive ones) but i feel its easier to go from a Hardtop to a Softtop without breakin the bank. But that being said I know people with jeeps who will only do softtops. so its really whatever but to me I feel hardtop would be a better choice.

England, i've been looking at the pre-2005 Wrangler and Jeep 2012 Cherokee - also the Compass (apparently that's not well liked around here, but it has decent fuel economy and looks pretty nice).... and manual. The vehicle itself, I wouldn't mind if it was quite dated."
Jeep,3dyox3,noise_shaper,2,Mon Jul 20 19:25:48 2015 UTC,"11k will get you a sweet TJ with money left over for customization. Find an unmolested example and start slowly with some all-terrain tires. This will improve the look, and off-road performance drastically. Then just enjoy one of the funniest vehicles on the planet. As the weeks or months go by you'll get a much better idea of where you want to go with it, and what you'll need. And you'll have the cash to do it."

Jeep,3dx0ld,Thegermanway,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:28:22 2015 UTC,Currently a 2004 LJ.  First Jeep was an '87 XJ though.  I've had a smattering of other Jeeps in between.  Always liked the looks of a 2dr XJ though.

Jeep,3dx0ld,ENTasticTaig,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:30:14 2015 UTC,radius arms front? Can't tell. Don't see any uppers
Jeep,3dx0ld,ENTasticTaig,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:37:47 2015 UTC,"Mid 70's Fords used a single pair of radius arms and coils. I kept the design with the wedges and opted to use a pair of long arms by James Duff that I got off a Bronco owner. It flexes fantastic and rides well. The only concern people have with this setup is that it can supposedly unload on you on steep inclines, but we put it to the test and didn't have that problem at all on a near 30 degree incline a month ago up in Naches, WA. Plus, if it happened, a strap would take care of that issue."
Jeep,3dx0ld,einulfr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:27:26 2015 UTC,"Ahh I see. I don't think this particular design could unload. I know RA usually do but this rig seems to not have the two separate arms, one short one long, traveling different radius's but connected together. Correct me if I'm wrong but I think that's what causes unloading. This design seems cool and flex's better than I ever would have thought."
Jeep,3dx0ld,einulfr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:50:38 2015 UTC,"Technically, I think it could swing down since there's little to hold it in there (i.e. no binding at a certain point since its basically a huge hinge). But, in practice I just don't see it happening. But, if it ever does, I'll strap it to get through and then follow up by adding an ATV winch under the front so I can do it from the cab."
Jeep,3dx0ld,willybepop,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:53:30 2015 UTC,"There are a few suck up winch builds on jeep forums.  Imped I think put one on his jeep near the beginning of his build. It's def something to look into. Regardless, sick build. I've always liked XJ's"

Jeep,3dzmrc,gordymills,3,Mon Jul 20 20:41:36 2015 UTC,"Ask them to drop the price and if they agree, pay an automobile inspector to check it out. Do not let the sellers know what he finds out because it could hurt your new low price. Find a way to keep it confidential, that's important for you.  He'll make sure the frame and other vitals are good to go. If it's just a front end and radiator that's wrong with it, what a great price to get into owning a Jeep. Especially if you do the work yourself. Radiators are easy."
Jeep,3dzmrc,gloriously_ontopic,2,Mon Jul 20 21:55:49 2015 UTC,"Hard to say without really looking at it, but let's assume this wasn't a head-on at 50 and you're not dealing with a bent frame.    That said, take a while to climb around and look closely, you'll want to check all the mounts and bolts that connect the drivetrain to the frame.  Not that it can't be fixed, but broken motor mounts or sprung bolts will def add to the price.    Another item to keep in mind is the gas.  Whatever gas has been sitting in the system has probably turned.  So the fuel system probable has a nice vainer on it by now.  Bad gas has a distinctive smell, so you could probably tell by smelling under the gas cap, but it's not really going to tell you much.  Another ""issue"" that might increase your cost, but is totally fixable.    Lastly, look closely how far back the radiator was pushed, if it's in the fan, you might have some other issues, the least of which is a new fan.  Don't necessarily shy away from a wreck, but spend some additional time poking around.  Don't forget your flashlight and dress so you can climb around under.  The real question is why is this sitting.  Chances are it was considered totaled by the insurance company and the owner bought it out for 400-500 for a hobby they never got around to.  Honestly, I'd play hardball on this, we're talking 150k miles on a 15 year old jeep that's been wrecked and sitting for 2+ years.  Offer 'em 1200 and when they say no, tell them to hang onto your number and let you know if they have a change of heart, then wait for the phone to ring.    Honestly, if the fan isnt' in the radiator, pull your car around and jump it.  It will run horrible (especially if the gas has turned) but knowing the motor will turn over is a step in the right direction.  Good luck!"
Jeep,3dzmrc,docthirst,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:57:18 2015 UTC,Thoroughly inspect the frame for damage
Jeep,3dzmrc,PALIN_FER_PREZ_2016,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:53:59 2015 UTC,"Honestly it depends what you want it for. I mean are you looking to fix then drive it? Or would you be interested in parting it out? Two axles, seats, dashboard, possible airbags?, skid plates, transfer case. The list really goes on. If you could talk them down even better. Should be enough in parts to make the 2k back but would just take time."
Jeep,3dzmrc,Valkyrie4x4,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:51:50 2015 UTC,"I want to fix it and drive it, and I'd rather start my build here than replacing perfectly good parts with upgrades."
Jeep,3dzmrc,Valkyrie4x4,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:21:53 2015 UTC,"Well then the only thing I'd be worried about replacing is the grill. And it may take some time to fund a hood, then gotta match the colors."
Jeep,3e0vc6,the_joofro,3,Tue Jul 21 02:27:55 2015 UTC,Lol you've left out a lot of important info here. What model? What year? Do you wheel often? What size are your current tires?
Jeep,3e0vc6,TheMelonKid,2,Tue Jul 21 02:38:47 2015 UTC,Why lift it if you care about mileage so much and aren't adding larger tires? Lifting is usually primarily so you can fit larger tires so I don't really see your logic for wanting to lift your jeep.
Jeep,3e0vc6,aussie_jason,2,Tue Jul 21 02:43:31 2015 UTC,I have a 2009 JK. I'm not doing serious rock crawling or anything but i do enjoy occasionally taking it down a trail. To be honest I don't even know the size of the stock wrangler tires. Probably like 30's right? Yea it was pretty dumb not to include this in the original
Jeep,3e0vc6,aussie_jason,3,Tue Jul 21 02:52:14 2015 UTC,"Leave it stock, you don't need to lift it."

Jeep,3e0vc6,Valkyrie4x4,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:58:22 2015 UTC,"stock tires.  Tj personally think a 4.5"" would be good. Room to flex, not to tall, but a good hight if you do go up tir size because it will work with 33's and 35's  Jk's need less lift because of better designed fender wells. Wouldn't need to go more that. 3.5"" lift.   Long arm would make a more comfortable ride but is costly. Short arms are cheap and easy but not as soft of a ride."

Jeep,3e0te9,NumbbSkulll,2,Tue Jul 21 02:14:55 2015 UTC,Looks like the bumpstop fell out and the got pinched between the coil. Depending on modifications its pretty important.   I say depending only because some people with lifts can't hit bumpstops anymore anyway. But ideally you are set up to hit the bumpstops at full bump.

Jeep,3dydja,ry2k,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:22:44 2015 UTC,"Speaking as an owner of both, they're both great vehicles and very similar in many ways but also VERY different in many ways. First off, the 3.8L V6 is a perfectly good engine, the 3.6L is simply a better engine. So while yes the 3.6 is more preferred, that shouldn't dissuade you from buying the 3.8L. I got my 4 door used with 33's and a 2.5"" lift for 16.3k with 72k miles. Now that they've been out for a while the cost of 4 door models used is finally coming down to reasonable prices. The sport and the sahara are equally as capable offroad, the only difference is bells and whistles. The sport is usually pretty barebones while the sahara tends to have nicer audio/leather etc. If you park on campus, you'll want a hard top. They're all good vehicles, I would seriously recommend test driving both before making a decision. Also the 2 door rear storage (with no seat) is pretty small, personally I'd shoot for a 4 door if you move often."
Jeep,3dydja,Kiriesh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:04:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response.  And yea I really like the tacomas too, but I've always wanted to cruise down the beach with the top down & doors off, ya know?  But if I find a really good deal on a tacoma I won't pass it up.  Did you get your wrangler through a dealership or individual?"
Jeep,3dydja,Kiriesh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:12:37 2015 UTC,"If you're buying used, buy private party.

Jeep,3dvrf9,evilpuke,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:31:01 2015 UTC,"Sure! I've had this on the back burner for a while. I did this now because I blew a fuse for my electric fan on my ZJ at a water crossing last weekend. I bought a 5 pack of relays with harnesses, and two 6 position terminal strips off of amazon. The fuse block I already had laying around, but I got it from a parts store, I think. I wired it up like any normal relay, only five times. The ground for each relay is soldered together so they only share a single wire bolted to ground. The wire from the switch goes to one terminal block, and the wire to the accessories goes to another(it looks like there's only one terminal step because I stacked then for space saving). The power wires are all separate on the fuse block using an appropriately sized fuse. The terminal strips make it super easy to connect and disconnect accessories. Having everything labeled, organized, and in one spot is another big plus. Now that everything is laid out, I can go out and get a waterproof box of the correct size. That should solve my fuse blowing problem!  Also, it complements the switch panel I just finished!"

Jeep,3dvig4,markymarksprow,2,Sun Jul 19 21:42:47 2015 UTC,"2001 XJ Sport. Totally rust free (yes even underneath) with 133K miles. I've wanted to join the XJ club for about 2 years and finally found one in my price range ($4000). Super excited to start modding, but it's going to be my DD in college this fall, so the typical 4"" lift and 31"" tires is not going to happen. Lots of painting, leveling, a roof rack, lighting, and sound quality audio work to be done to this thing!"
Jeep,3dvig4,aussie_jason,2,Sun Jul 19 21:46:45 2015 UTC,"Why would you paint it? At least in the pic the paint looks great. Just get a cheap aftermarket head unit with Bluetooth to upgrade the audio, no need to go all out, you're still going to have tons of road noise so pumping $ into a sound system is kind of a waste.  It looks like the rear is just sagging due to old leaf springs so the only leveling I would do is to replace them, no need to mess with blocks or the like. For lighting definitely upgrade the headlight harness, if you search this sub (actually no, you should search /r/CherokeeXJ not here )for headlight you will get some quality results on how to do that.  With the roof rack I would advise to leave the factory rails on even if they aren't needed otherwise you will have to deal with rust around the nutserts once they are exposed to the elements, which is something on my todo list to address."
Jeep,3dvig4,JustEmptyEveryPocket,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:01:57 2015 UTC,"I work in the car audio industry, so having a bitching system is pretty much a must. In terms of road noise, Stinger makes a great product called RoadKill to kill engine and road noise. The faded trim is annoying, and the clear coat is pulling up on a few different spots.   I've looked for some leaf springs, I've heard I can take some off an S10... Is that true?   I like the headlights they are brand new, but you aren't the first person to advise for the beefier harness so that'll be on that list.   And yes agreed on leaving the factory rack. The one I was planning on getting does utilize them so I should be in great shape.   I've also heard that I can replace the brakes with Jeep WJ brakes, is that also advised? The perks are apparently a huge improvement in stopping power Nd I think they are a little cheaper."
Jeep,3dvig4,TheMelonKid,3,Mon Jul 20 05:16:15 2015 UTC,"-I'm not so sure that replacing old worn out leaf springs with different old worn out leaf springs is a good idea even if they do fit. I can't comment on whether S10 springs would actually work or not, never heard of it til now. If you're going through the trouble of replacing them it's worth it to buy new parts in my opinion. That will definitely lift the truck back to stock height.  -Why do you feel the need to replace the factory harness for the headlights? My factory harness has 235k miles on it with no signs of wear or overheating issues on the wires. I just did a motor swap on my XJ last month and saw them up close while removing the grill. Sounds like a waste of money unless you're having issues with your sealed beams or upgrading to higher than stock wattage bulbs. Not saying it wouldn't be an improvement, I just don't see it as being necessary. It is easy and cheap though, so have at it.  -My wife and I own several jeeps. (2 XJ's, 1 WJ, and 1 TJ) The WJ uses a 16"" wheel (17"" for the V8 models) and your XJ uses a 15"" wheel. The calipers are usually sized as big as possible to get the best braking performance. I read several reviews saying they made 15"" rims fit on their WJ's but had to grind a little or had to use pretty thin rims. Officially Jeep says that 16"" rims are the MINIMUM size for a WJ. This translates to if you use the calipers, rotors, and pads for a WJ on your XJ you'll likely need a 16"" wheel to compensate for the size, or at least a thin walled 15"". You will definitely see an improvement in braking performance over the standard XJ braking system. Just beware you might need new wheels and tires to make it work. And don't bother getting the wheels and tires off the WJ you're pulling the brakes from because WJ's use a 5x5 bolt pattern and your XJ uses 5x4.5.   Hate to be the devil's advocate but wanted to offer an informed opinion from someone with experience in the subject.  Tl;dr - Use new leaf springs for your XJ, changing headlight wiring harness is unnecessary but wouldn't hurt, and you'll likely need 16"" wheels for a brake system swap with a WJ."
Jeep,3dwmfy,linuxguy192,3,Mon Jul 20 03:36:25 2015 UTC,Probably in the 15 -17k range but it has to be the right buyer. If you try to sell it to a dealership or someone who's looking at kbb they're going to tell you 5k.

Jeep,3dvoln,El_Andy_The_Andy,3,Sun Jul 19 22:34:43 2015 UTC,"What color is the coolant in your reservoir?   Red generally means transmission fluid or power steering fluid.   Take a picture that isnt so dang close. I can't identify what that part is you are pointing at. In one pic it looks like its near your exhaust header (which is where the power steering pump would be). In another picture I see the oil filter which is on the complete other side of the engine.   Open up the hood and take a picture so I can see more of the engine bay. Photoshop in an arrow to the leaking component.   At this point I'm going to lean towards power steering. Most Jeeps will use green or orange coolant (but it can be anything, I personally use clear zerex g05).  Have you checked all of your fluid levels? How fast is the leak?   If its just a few drops every time you park, its not as urgent as you think.   Power steering pumps are a bit of a pain depending on the year.  Edit: ok Ithought I was looking at a 4.0... that makes more sense. Disregard almost everything I said. Check fluid levels."
Jeep,3dvoln,hydrogenous,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:37:38 2015 UTC,Haha no worries man. All levels are good. It's hard to get a zoomed out picture. I'm attempting to take one with a better camera that has a fish eye lens. The fluid doesn't taste sweet like antifreeze. It only drips while running and a few minutes after running. I would say one drop every 30 seconds for about 10 minutes after shutting off. It doesn't increase its drip rate while engine is running.
Jeep,3dvoln,hydrogenous,3,Sun Jul 19 23:14:16 2015 UTC,"Really sounds like power steering to me. Can you identify the leaking component for me? If its the power steering system, you will see the steering wheel column (shaft with a universal joint about halfway down) going into it. You should also see two high pressure hydraulic hoses going from the pump to the box. The pump will also have a pulley that runs off your serpantine belt.   Also, don't taste libricants. Lol"

Jeep,3dvbet,asadog,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:42:46 2015 UTC,Should cost around $1000-$1300 for both axles depending on the gear and if there is a carrier break.
Jeep,3dvbet,GRZMNKY,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:01:46 2015 UTC,Is there no discount for already having the axle removed from the vehicle?
Jeep,3dvbet,BigMrKitty,3,Sun Jul 19 21:18:23 2015 UTC,You don't need to take the axle out of the vehicle to regear them
Jeep,3dvbet,JEEPATHON,0,Sun Jul 19 22:15:38 2015 UTC,"I know, but it makes it easier."
Jeep,3dvbet,BigMrKitty,2,Mon Jul 20 02:26:40 2015 UTC,Actually no. It makes it more difficult cause you have to lift this big ass axles up and put them on a stand or jack to work on them. When the jeep is on the hoist at eye level it is the easiest to work on. A shop MAY give you a discount if you drop the axles off and ask them to work on them when it is slow that way you are not holding up a spot on the hoist for a week.
Jeep,3dvbet,BigMrKitty,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:41:25 2015 UTC,"No, it actually doesn't. Regearing only messes with the carrier, not the housing"
Jeep,3dvbet,BigMrKitty,0,Mon Jul 20 15:25:22 2015 UTC,"It only messes with the carrier if you're going from 3.73 gears or below to 4.10 or above in a dana.  Otherwise the only parts that change are the ring and pinion and wear parts. It makes it easier to access everything if you take the axle though, and as someone else said, your vehicle doesn't take up space on a lift."
Jeep,3dvbet,GRZMNKY,3,Mon Jul 20 17:22:53 2015 UTC,"I think you have your mind set on taking the axle out, and you really shouldn't. The ring and pinion is part of the carrier, so yes you are messing with the carrier as the carrier needs to come out to do a regear. It does not make anything easier to take the whole axle out, all a regear requires is that the axle shafts slide out a few inches to get the carrier out. Then it goes back together. Doesn't even need to be done on a lift."
Jeep,3dvbet,Valkyrie4x4,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:06:57 2015 UTC,Don't worry. I'm going to be doing it myself and I won't take the axle out when I do. I was just curious if there was any discount if I did take it out and take it to a shop.

Jeep,3dugo4,XGhostface408X,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:42:12 2015 UTC,Yea the rubber thing is probably newer since it's so clean. The washer is metal and rusty so obviously it's been in there for a while but it just came up with some leaves so I have no idea what it is

Jeep,3due0q,NoNoNotorious89,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:57:28 2015 UTC,"You can either hook a jack up under the door after days of using PB blaster to penetrate the bolts and free them, then try to jack to doors up. Use a long piece of wood under your door to avoid denting the metal. You can use a come-along and block of wood and wrap your door and try to pry it upwards from the ceiling. Or do what I did after all that failed. I drilled out the torx screws using a 8mm drill bit and then went and found some M8 Flat Head Socket Cap Screws and they should screw right back into the plates inside the door.  You can purchase new bolts from NAPA for like 4.00 per pair.   What I did once I got the plates off, in order to free the seized doors bolts, was to put them into my wood stove and then bang them out. You may also try heating them while on the Jeep as well. that may free them.. Good luck!"

Jeep,3drniq,ScubaSteveeeeeeee,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:32:14 2015 UTC,"They won't throw on the 37s without a differential/gear upgrade ($1800 including service and tax). The AEV factory doesn't allow you to do anything 'not their way' for some reason. Another example is that they wouldn't let me keep my stock wheels with the 35s.   Unfortunately, a couple local shops quoted me a bit more with service and tax so I decided to go with AEV. I'm 17 and don't have much experience with installing parts so I wanted some professionals to do it. I will be installing things like corner guards, a bullbar, lights, etc. myself but that's about the extent of my ability."

Jeep,3dr9ny,m4ttr33d,2,Sat Jul 18 21:06:04 2015 UTC,I have a 6 plus also I use a Panavise bracket that uses 2 of the radio screws to mount it. I'm also using a Rockform case which has a rare earth magnet embedded in the back anti slip pad. Since the Panavise bracket is steel the phone sticks really well.  It's pretty much the perfect setup for me.
Jeep,3dr9ny,Grandmastrgusto,2,Sat Jul 18 22:22:33 2015 UTC,"I put a lot of thought into this, and created a solution that is a mix of things. Here's my original post: http://www.reddit.com/r/Jeep/comments/3a8vs0/cell_phone_mount_had_to_get_it_right_part_links/  Basically started with the Rugged Ridge dash mount, but the phone holder was flimsy and out of reach, so I attached a RAM mount arm to the camera socket and then a Scosche magnetic mount to that. I love it. Looks clean and custom, super sturdy, and the phone position is perfect.  Edit: more pics of the set up: http://m.imgur.com/a/B9qfl"
Jeep,3dr9ny,NikonD3s,2,Sun Jul 19 03:23:52 2015 UTC,Not specifically for iPhone but I use this for my Note 4.  http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JRGOKQ8/ref=cm_sw_r_udp_awd_vLPQvb8BR2JXP  Very adjustable and stays on through the heat in Houston.  It has adhesive on the suction cup so make sure it's where you want to keep it when you put it on.  It's not impossible to take off and move but it's not easy.  The clamps hold the phone well and are easily engaged/released.

Short hair is impossible to get out. I had a CRV for 8 years, and honestly it looked pretty good how often my dog was in it with me.  He literally is in my vehicle every single day at least once.    Treat the source. Even with shepherds, regular bathing and brushing will cut down a lot on the hair. Use a rake, furminator, or stripper brush. Important is actually a really good shampoo. Then they shed less.    I tend to throw a blanket down just to keep the hair from the cracks a lot. It helps. Not as much of a pain in the ass as covers.  Easy to swap out.   lint rollers are a lot of work. I did pick up one of those as seen on TV sticky buddys. It does help gather the hair even out of Cracks so it's easier to pick up. Similar to the rubber glove idea.  https://www.stickybuddysale.com/?mid=1453515 A trick I still use is to spray static guard on all the seats regularly. Helps a ton!!!!

She sat in a garage for maybe 15 years or so and the fuel system is pretty screwed up. Fuel pressure was super low when I bought it. I put a new fuel pump in which got the pressure up to normal but I still have problems when the tank starts to get low so I'm guessing there's a lot of crap at the bottom of the tank, so my next move is a new gas tank. The weird thing about this particular Chief that I've never seen before is the ""Travel Tanks"". It has two gas tanks, the main tank switches over to the auxiliary tank automatically when its empty. On the dash is a switch for the gas gauge to show how much fuel is in each tank. Kind of crazy. I'd like to replace it with the original Travel Tank system but that seems unlikely."

Jeep,3dhto1,frehsprints,7,Thu Jul 16 12:12:25 2015 UTC,"Still won't probably do it justice, but make sure your camera is level. When your camera is tilted up to capture the hill, you're making it look flat. You need a shot where the jeep is still in view but your camera is parallel with flat ground"
Jeep,3dhto1,fulltankofgas,2,Thu Jul 16 14:18:00 2015 UTC,If it was parallel wouldnt you be taking pictures of the ground?
Jeep,3dhto1,Bonerspider,5,Thu Jul 16 16:04:15 2015 UTC,Not if you take it from the right place. Take a wider shot and then crop it.
Jeep,3dhto1,fulltankofgas,5,Thu Jul 16 16:31:55 2015 UTC,"Parallel with flat ground, as in, level.  You need to find a way to get high enough to get the shot. Nobody claimed it would be easy or practical."

Jeep,3dhto1,hex_m_hell,6,Fri Jul 17 00:22:07 2015 UTC,"Offroad photographer here. It's entirely a perspective thing. Out there in person, you have every sense telling you ""holy shit this is awesome"", but in a photo you only have 1 sense, visual. So you have to position your photo to include things that convey a sense of steepness. Often times, the only way to do so is to go snap a shot from the side of the ascent/descent, and frame it correctly, head on shots are much harder to get to communicate the hill climb unless you have a bottom behind the subject or side objects (in your case, trees) to show an angle. It's even harder to do all this while creating a genuinely good shot, so welcome to my hobby/profession :P"

Jeep,3dj3fw,HazyVortex,3,Fri Jul 17 01:39:43 2015 UTC,"Anytime your differentials are submerged in mud/water for a bit, you need to change your diff fluid. Water can get in and dilute the good fluid, which can ruin your gears. Engine isn't in trouble unless the air filter is submerged or unprotected with splashing water reaching it.

Jeep,3dmn1k,Cryo21,2,Fri Jul 17 14:37:40 2015 UTC,"Do you wheel your jeep often? OME is a quality kit but 4"" is a lot of lift for a JK, it would probably require new driveshafts. Also pushing 35s with 3.73 gearing is going to suck, and 37s would be terrible. If you plan on wheeling 37s there is a lot of other things you would have to upgrade."
Jeep,3dmn1k,JEEPATHON,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:13:46 2015 UTC,"Right now I wheel occasionally. Because it is a stock jeep I am very limited and specifically right now I wouldn't even think of taking it to the local off-road place here in illinois (Cliffs) because everything is mudded out like crazy.  See that is what I was thinking as well. My other thought is hitting a 2.5"" lift from OME and then sticking with 35s. My issue is I don't want my jeep to look ""stocky"" (as in like short and fat) I've seen a few jeeps that toss on fat tires and such but then their clearance is complete garbage in their wheel wells.  I am thinking the 35s would be a better idea because of the pricing of them. I can probably re-gear it. (not sure how but I'm smart and there are a ton of guides out there)"
Jeep,3dmn1k,JEEPATHON,3,Fri Jul 17 15:45:16 2015 UTC,"I think you are MUCH better off with 35s and 2.5"" OME kit. It is easier to install and you will run into a lot less complications."
Jeep,3dmn1k,JEEPATHON,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:16:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info! I am checking around for kits and such now. Sadly the only OME kit i found is a 2"" which sure is still good but I am keeping my eyes open.  I think I have decided to go with a lower kit for sure. It sounds like I will have nothing but troubles if I go with anything larger than 2.5. Especially since I only have the stock dana 30s and the 3.73 gearing. But I may end up changing the gearing."
Jeep,3dmn1k,JEEPATHON,2,Fri Jul 17 16:25:44 2015 UTC,"The lift range really has no affect on your axles or gearing... it will change the angle of your driveshafts though. Going over 3"" on a JK isn't the best. A lot of people say the 2"" OME kit actually nets about 2.5"" or more of lift."
Jeep,3dmn1k,JEEPATHON,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:31:54 2015 UTC,Oh that is great to know! That is a well priced kit for what I am looking at.  What I wonder though is with full steel front bumper and winch if it will sag the front end down to make it not leveled out.

Jeep,3dmn1k,AdaminBillerica,2,Fri Jul 17 16:48:04 2015 UTC,There would be no requirement for it. As long as your steering and suspension components are in good condition and torqued properly you have no need for a bigger shimmy shock

Jeep,3dl14l,DocOe96,4,Fri Jul 17 03:15:34 2015 UTC,"A new winch buyer should run synthetic line.  The safety is worth the price.  Secondly, save enough money to also buy the accessory kit.  You'll need the tree saver, snatch block, couple of d-rings."
Jeep,3dl14l,CuriousSupreme,2,Fri Jul 17 13:54:10 2015 UTC,"I will second going with synthetic.  You will never go back to steel.  Also, don't get the cheap knock-offs or the VR series, no matter what people tell you.  When you need to use your winch, you need it to work.  Save up a bit more and get this http://www.quadratec.com/products/92104_0010_07.htm"
Jeep,3dl14l,Rocksniffer3000,3,Fri Jul 17 17:20:40 2015 UTC,"Do some research before buying a winch.  There are a lot of options to choose from - including how much the winch can pull, where the solenoid is located (not so important for my purposes) and whether to get synthetic rope (important safety and use considerations).  Warns are definitely good winches but you're also paying a premium for the name.  If I didn't care about my money, I would buy a Warn."
Jeep,3dl14l,PivoLiubitel,3,Fri Jul 17 04:29:56 2015 UTC,M8000 is what's on the front of my rig and I love it. Can't say much about any others.
Jeep,3dl14l,phantomprophet,2,Fri Jul 17 14:40:40 2015 UTC,"I have that exact winch, the VR8000 on my 1995 YJ. I purchased it new via Amazon last winter at a discount and so far, it has done everything I've needed of it. I have pulled myself out of two very deep holes where my rear axle was in water and mud almost to the top of the rear tires (33"" BFG KOs). I've also winched down several large trees that were hanging precariously over trails after a storm came through so that we could pass safely.   I did a LOT of research and looked very hard at the Quadratech and ENGO line of winches in my price range but settled on the Warn. Two reasons: 1) The sale price on Amazon 2) The Warn name and limited lifetime warranty. Yes, it has Chinese components, but many winches in this price range do, so for me that alone was not a deal breaker. I know guys who get good service from Chicom Harbor Freight winches, but the support/customer service is abysmal and I would not want to count on them to be a particularly dependable, long lasting winch. Given that I built my jeep as a mid range capable off road crawler with a moderate lift and upgrades that I can still drive home on the interstate at the end of the day, the Warn VR fit my needs AND price range. I would buy it again. HOWEVER, if you can opt to save up some more money, it would be advisable to get the synthetic line VR, or better yet the M8000 or ENGO equivalent. They are better winches, no doubt, but the VR8000 holds it's own in that price range and has the Warn name/warranty. If you have a TJ or JK, or any 4-door or ""heavy"" rig, a 10000 lb winch would be a no brainer, all other notes above still applicable."
Jeep,3dl14l,mike1919,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:10:05 2015 UTC,I don't have a winch yet but I would check out Engo winches - better reviews at better deals it seems

Jeep,3dl14l,Patman03,6,Fri Jul 17 04:15:29 2015 UTC,Vr warn winches are made in china so they offer them cheaper than the rest of their winches. I have an m8000 and its taken some serious abuse and it keeps chugging along.
Jeep,3dl14l,jjallllday,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:09:59 2015 UTC,"As another person said, VR’s are made in China, so you're paying for the name if you go with the VR. If your price limit is $500, I’d recommend Quadratec’s branded winches. I have the Q9500i and it’s been great and reliable.

Jeep,3di0mv,AntAPD,3,Thu Jul 16 12:58:46 2015 UTC,"So the other day I got around to installing this safe I bought. It was very easy and you just follow the directions. 4 bolts and the seats out.  I didn't even have to unhook the wiring harness. I removed the plate it mounted to, removed the harness and zip tied it where the instructions said.  I didn't remove the seat I just rocked it back and had my dad hold it.  It does NOT mount to the rear bolts but the rear of the box rests on the carpet under the seat.  The front mounts are odd because one side is under the seat mount, one size is on top but no big deal. It fit perfect.  There is an optional bolt you can mount inside the box in the rear but it requires bl drilling through the floor pan but I didn't do that.  I'm real happy with it.  The box had plenty of room for a .45 compact or .40 full size plus a spare mag with extra room. My Serpa holster was too thick and hit while closing.  It has a ball bearing slider which is very smooth.  It's got a lot of room inside.   The keys are double cut (top and bottom) and the lock feels really solid. Mine has the regular camlock but there is a push button version that requires lubrication or it sticks.  I feel it is very tough and would stop someone from stealing it unless they came with some serious tools.  10/10 would recommend it. Only thing was the inside has no type of liner so I used that foam stuff you put in toolbox drawers to give it a cushion"

Jeep,3dm6em,calvarez,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:35:08 2015 UTC,"It's a very thin coax, but it is coax.  Take a look at the connector; it's even a coaxial connector.  Some people think coax is always the huge stuff in your house (RG-8 or RG-58).  Coax just means coaxial, one conductor inside another."

So I want to get a nice looking 4-door Jeep and travel where its warm all year. Lifted with nice tires and all that. Probably keep the normal doors cuz I have a dog. But definitely safari straps. A lot of you probably wont care, but the rest of you will be seeing me frequent this sub in the next few months as I purchase and upgrade the ride."
Jeep,3djqlm,Kiriesh,6,Thu Jul 16 20:52:59 2015 UTC,"For what its worth, your dog (especially in a wrangler) should be harnessed into the seat anyways so doors won't really matter. Mine loves riding in the back seat with the doors off. She's lazy as hell so she'll sprawl on the seat and still have her nose sticking out beyond the door-sill. If you're looking to research, I'd suggest reading the JK FAQ (JK is the factory designation for any wrangler made 2007+, so any 4 door wrangler will be a JK, or often referred to as JKU). Feel free to PM me or ask here if you have any specific questions!"
Jeep,3djqlm,Kiriesh,-1,Thu Jul 16 23:29:55 2015 UTC,"I guess in regards to safety and all that, my dog should be harnessed in but Ive taken him on road trips all over the east coast and never harnessed him.

They are fairly light, lighter than the stock rubicon wheels (15"" vs 16"" too though so apples and oranges kinda) They were one of the only wheels with 3.5"" backspacing I liked. They stay pretty clean. It's monsoon season so it rains daily. My whole jeep stays pretty dirty but the wheels tend to stay clean somehow. I've also aired down to 5 psi with no blown beads while climbing. Sometimes with almost all the jeeps weight on one wheel. I will be going to 17"" beadlocks to fit bigger brakes.

It was fine if ur not crawling but once u start climbing rock it feels incredibly unstable when u disconnect the sway bar completely. With this I can crawl and it doesn't feel like im tipping over all the time. It's worth on the front. rear I think the only time u need ones is if ur stretching the wheelbase

Jeep,3dihnm,TechnicianOrWhateva,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:18:01 2015 UTC,"My father had one (I think a 2006, with the 4.7L V8).  We liked it, but  honestly I don't know if I could recommend one.    Some of the issues we had included...   My dad hit a deer on the way home from the dealership about 10 minutes after finalizing the purchase.  Not the Jeeps fault, just sucked that it happened.  The idle always seemed kind of screwy, especially later in the vehicles life.  One more than one occasion, it died while idling.  A couple trips to the dealer returned nothing, but from looking around online, it seems like this was a common issue and that some people even had them die at highway speeds. Lots of little electrical gremlins later in the vehicles life.  Regardless of whether or not it was set to do so, the automatic wipers would take over and fluctuate speed, for instance. After a while, the interior really started to fall apart.  Interior door handles broke off, the ""moon roof"" shade on the passenger side got broken so you couldn't open it up, etc.   The third row seats are almost useless unless the passengers are kids, or they are being used on a short trip.  And, for some stupid reason, the rear climate control knobs were located in the third row.  So, it was basically a pointless feature for my family.  I can't speak for it's off-road prowess. It never went off-road in the 8 years we had it.  It did perform well enough in the snow though.   Gas mileage was lousy, but I think that's a given.     We liked ours, but it wasn't without fault."

Jeep,3dhvx9,MerakiHD,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:11:05 2015 UTC,"If you're taking it to a shop anyway, ask them to check the frame. If you'd rather do it yourself, a brass hammer works well. Just tap your way down the frame and listen for changes in tone. Also consider jamming a high-pressure hose in a drainage hole in the front of the frame until water comes out the rear drainage hole. If there are chunks of rusty metal, or even a bunch of grime washing out, chances are the interior of your frame is suffering."

Jeep,3dhvx9,goXenigmaXgo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:33:38 2015 UTC,"It depends. Sections of frame for just this purpose are a few hundred bucks, depending on the section. The labor to get specific sections out can be tricky, but your real cost sink will be the welding. It probably won't run you a grand total, but I'd discuss that with the shop after the it mechanic checks it out.   All in all, let the shop do the inspection, and listen their recommendations. If it's not going to be too pricey, go with what you feel."

Jeep,3dc4os,PushinDonuts,7,Wed Jul 15 19:54:09 2015 UTC,It's gorgeous.   Just waiting for Jeep to build a pickup. I'd really rather not have to find an old J series to fix up. And most of us can't afford a new AEV Brute.  If they make a midsize truck then Mopar/Fiat would compete with the Chevy Colorado/GMC Canyon without harming Ram Truck sales.   I'm worried that if they remake the Dodge Dakota then no Jeep truck. I've been wanting a truck so that'll be my next car purchase. Don't know how long I can hold out for a Jeep one.
Jeep,3dc4os,slightlysubversive,6,Wed Jul 15 07:50:50 2015 UTC,"The Dakota is why they got rid of the Comanche. You'd think they'd give people what they want most, but they just didn't want competition inside the company. But I'd rather have a full sized jeep pickup anyway."

That is what I would do.  I'd have it towed to my mechanic's place. Where i live that is at least a $60 hookup charge IF the mechanic's place is close by (under a certain amount of miles).  IMO $60 is better than the kinds of fees the average city will charge you for towing and tow lot storage fees.   edit: hell! Tow operators are often pretty unscrupulous so you might be able to offer them cash for a tow off the books. I did it for $20 once.
Jeep,3dflzt,dirtymoney,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:48:21 2015 UTC,"AAA or car insurance road side should cover the tow as well, although might only do it to the closest dealer. If you call the dealer and tell them what's going on they might not care."

From this picture it looks like you're running 33's with a lot of clearance to the fender.    To give you an idea of lift, here's my TJ that runs 33s, has a 4"" suspension lift and a 1.5"" body lift.  Keep in mind that a stock TJ looked like this and, with the exception of Rubicons, had up to 30"" tires.  A stock YJ looked like this and had up to a ~28"" tire.  I wouldn't be surprised if you actually do have 7"" of lift between the suspension and body lifts there."
Jeep,3dgx4x,Might8eAThrowaway,3,Thu Jul 16 04:32:49 2015 UTC,Complexity of the front? They're both differentials and they're built the same. Locking the front is generally more effective though.   I'd do the two Eaton's myself. They're plenty good. Arb is pretty overpriced and complicated.
Jeep,3dgx4x,ikidd,2,Thu Jul 16 05:12:28 2015 UTC,"If you're regearing, get the eatons. It's going to cost much more to add in a front ARB later than it will to buy a compressor. Air lockers have their perks but in your situation get the dual lockers."
Jeep,3dgx4x,Kiriesh,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:12:30 2015 UTC,What are the perks to an air locker?
Jeep,3dgx4x,SirNut,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:00:29 2015 UTC,(Most) electric lockers will have a max pressure it can operate at. They often have a safety release that will unlock the diff if there's too much pressure. Air lockers will run themselves into the ground. Additionally an air line is fairly easy to mend on the trail (a simple push to fit connector and some cutters usually can do in a pinch) while a cut electrical cable is not an easy fix to either splice and solder or crimp on the trail.
Jeep,3dgx4x,Kiriesh,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:38:38 2015 UTC,I never knew e-lockers had a safety release. Do the factory lockers have them? I've never noticed my 15 JKUR lockers releasing but that being said I haven't had a chance to push them yet. I also don't even know if they have a safety release. haha
Jeep,3dgx4x,SirNut,2,Thu Jul 16 19:41:03 2015 UTC,"I remember reading an article about the eatons having that issue a while back, but to be perfectly honest I really don't know about the factory elockers."
Jeep,3dgx4x,Kiriesh,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:43:02 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the honesty, I used to have air lockers and never had anything but problems with them, however that was because the air line was very old and brittle. I'm enjoying the e-lockers for now but if I ever have to replace them I would probably use air just so I have more reasons to get a nice compressor ;)"
Jeep,3dgx4x,SirNut,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:47:59 2015 UTC,"I've always felt the compressor was a weak point in the ARB.  It's a good compressor (for the ridiculous price) but when they crap out, you can't just run a length of wire and jumper it to 12v to make it work like an elocker.  And I would expect everyone keeps wire and crimp connectors in their toolbox to fix electrical issues."
Jeep,3dgx4x,ikidd,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:28:24 2015 UTC,"If you maintain your compressor well it shouldn't be crapping out on you. It's not like actuating the locker solenoids puts extra load on it. While I love my ARB compressor you don't need one to run the lockers. Any compressor whether it's electric or belt driven will work as long as you have a small air tank. The really only necessary ARB part you need aside from the lockers is a $40 manifold to attach the solenoids to, and even then you can easily make a work around if you'd rather make one yourself. Crimped connectors aren't overly strong especially if you're not soldering them, and requires much more work than plugging an airline leak. If I slashed an airline all I would need is a female to female push to connect connector. Id just cut out the cut and push the ends into the connector then I'm back to normal."

Jeep,3dgx4x,mokujin,2,Thu Jul 16 14:33:38 2015 UTC,Mechanic said it was more complex since its a KK Cherokee. I'm with the buy once cry once mentality.
Jeep,3dgx4x,ajohns1288,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:28:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you have to drop the whole front diff since it's IFS. Have you thought about a detroit locker up front? If you are only going to use 4wd off road, it would work great. It only locks when there is torque applied so as long as the driveshaft isn't powered, it will stay open."

Jeep,3dgx4x,ikidd,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:58:42 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's terrible.  I'd have figured it would slip before it broke those.  How old was that unit and did he send it back to them for warranty?"
Jeep,3dgx4x,einulfr,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:23:48 2015 UTC,"The one in the D30 was fine, that was the one from the Ford 8.8 axle after about 6 months. It's a trail-only rig and he lives in Finland, so it mostly sees a lot of mossy earth, mud and snow. He PayPals me $ for whatever parts he wants, then we wait a bit and I ship him a big care package for far cheaper than what it would cost to have stuff shipped directly from the sellers.   The engagement pins are a known problem (so much that they make a service kit) but he broke the ball ramp assembly somehow, too. $600 for both kits. I think he replaced them this time around, but wants to switch to an ARB or OX if it fails again. I forgot about OX, it's a cable-actuated selectable locker, if anyone is interested in another option. And there's always the Detroits if you want a solid auto locker, but I've ridden in my buddy's TJ and that constant engagement/disengagement shit would drive me nuts on the pavement, I don't care how reliable or less expensive it is.  For my troubles, he gave me his old D30 Lock-Right for free. Fantastic little thing, can't wait to pair it up with an ARB in the rear soon. Only drawback is I can't really use 4H Full Time in my NP242 since it splits 48/52."
Jeep,3dgx4x,ikidd,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:48:56 2015 UTC,"I have a Spartan in the front, I actually have very little issues with it and it works great.  I have a 242 as well, and in 2WD it never engages.  It stays engaged in FT unless I'm turning sharp, and it just pulls me up loose hills like nothing.  It's really stiff steering offroad in PT. I don't think I would bother with a selectable in the front after having used this one for a year now.  It can be a bit squirrelly if you have PT engaged on snow and ice but you get used to it.  I'm going to look up the OX that you mention, I'd like something other than the LSD in the D44a, wonder if they actually make one for that axle.  Not a lot of options for it.  Edit: nope.  And for that price, I'd get the elocker.  Lol, shifter and cable not included, another $150.  They're optimists."
Jeep,3dgx4x,einulfr,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:16:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't even know my Lock Right is up there in 2WD. Not even a peep. But it's a little animal on the trails when it's engaged. I have a factory LSD in the rear but the clutches are probably worn out.  Looks like OX prices went up quite a bit since I last checked, they were about $699 a few years ago. Another nice thing about ARB's is that you get an excuse to have a compressor for airing up your tires or running air tools."

It's always best top take the tire of the tailgate though, so even though the stock carrier can handle it, I'd still say do it unless you want to upgrade something else first. As far as looks, who cares? Functionality first, looks second.  For tire carriers the thing to consider is the hinge. Some manf just put a single connection point that means the carrier will sag or wear quicker. I don't think that is a problem with evo tho. the carrier itself is 1300?  Plus, that isn't a bumper, it connects to the side corners. Idk, personally I would get a bumper w/ tire carrier combo. Unless you actually plan on gettin into the 37+ tire range that is overkill."
Jeep,3dg0eq,DragonsFyre,3,Thu Jul 16 00:48:37 2015 UTC,"It's a great quality carrier from a great company but your 33's will look very awkward with it. I've seen it with 35s and it makes them look small. Realistically to have the look that it advertises you'll need to be running 37s+. It's a great carrier so if you want it power to you, but it'll be a PITA for every day opening and closing (has two latches needing removal to open) and it'll be overkill for your needs. Keep in mind it'll also require EVO corner guards, and permanent modification to your tub."
Jeep,3df8yu,iPadycake4hire,3,Wed Jul 15 20:25:23 2015 UTC,"With the engine off, spin the fan by hand. If it's hard too spin my guess is there is some mud in there too. Clean it out and try again. If it still doesn't spin the fan motor may just be shot. Thad be my guess at least"
Jeep,3df8yu,DragonsFyre,2,Wed Jul 15 23:19:59 2015 UTC,"Also make sure you got all of the mud out. I was running hot on the highway for a while, even though I had cleaned out the radiator fins (or so I thought). It turns out that the engine side of the radiator had a bunch of mud in it as well that took me a while to get out with the hose. The weird part is that it didn't really look all that dirty until is started spraying it from the back and mud started flowing out.  I found that the best method was to just get everything out of the way and use a hose with no attachment. Make sure not to bend the fins."
Jeep,3df8yu,craigjclemson,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:54:07 2015 UTC,I just drove it to the dealership to get it looked at but I spun the fan and it seemed to move fine.   The engine didn't overheat or anything but when I parked the pressure relief valve blew again which makes me think there is air in the coolant system?
Jeep,3df8yu,thecatstits,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:15:33 2015 UTC,It sounds to me like the fan is shot. The ac system requires that fan to be on to cool the condenser on the high side. If the pressure gets too high the cutoff switch will shut the compressor down thus losing cooling ability.
Jeep,3df8yu,thecatstits,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:10:51 2015 UTC,That's probably it.  Because I can hear the fan try to cut on and then cut off
Jeep,3deqk4,mcflannelman,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:19:05 2015 UTC,"I'm just one voice here, but I love the 86s.  Last of a breed.  I would want to keep things original.  I can also tell you I would jump on buying an 86 CJ7 and I wouldn't pay a dime for it with a GM swap.  I'm sure plenty of folks here would disagree with me, but there is no way in hell I would choose a frankenstein swap instead of a rebuild."
Jeep,3deqk4,tenorsaxman11,2,Wed Jul 15 18:54:04 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that I wouldn't want to buy it if someone else had done the swap but I wouldn't have any worries about  swapping a later model GM into one. Especially if you could pick up a vortec, ~20 mpgs depending on setup is nice. The full size jeep guys are doing it alot with great success."
Jeep,3deqk4,theking82,2,Wed Jul 15 19:27:38 2015 UTC,Yeah. I feel the same way. I just imagine it's going to be a nightmare swapping it.
Jeep,3deqk4,BRMD_xRipx,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:34:34 2015 UTC,"While the 86s obviously didn't, CJs had GM engines in them far before AMC engines. I wouldn't call it a Frankenstein just because it has a GM engine."
Jeep,3deqk4,igeek3,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:16:38 2015 UTC,"OK, this might be my opinion, but I really want to try this someday. If you've got decent mechanical experience you can put a 4BT Cummins Diesel engine in your jeep. You will get lots of torque and it's not too large so good MPG (some people on the jeep forms say they got 30MPG with 33"")  You're gonna need an engine  You will also need an install kit  alternative kits  Good Luck"
Jeep,3deqk4,BRMD_xRipx,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:28:03 2015 UTC,"I have a mid 80s Chevy 350 in my 66 CJ5 and IT IS AMAZING. While the 4.2 is reliable as hell, it's quite weak and inefficient. If you're gonna rebuild it, you might as well rebuild a V8 and swap it in. You'll get the same or better mileage,  definitely better if fuel injected. It's not a nightmare by any means but it is hard work. In the end I bet you'll be glad you did! But keeping this in mind, you'll have to swap out your transmission and axles. The good thing about this swap is it's been done a jillion times and there is so much info out there on it. Novak Adapters has all the parts you could possibly need. I wouldn't recommend the 4BT diesel swap because that is a MASSIVE and heavy engine, it will be obnoxiously loud and will rattle your bones loose. Spare parts are rarer and more expensive. I don't get why people put that engine in their small rigs. I'd rather get the QSB 3.3 Cummins diesel than that hog 4BT."
Jeep,3deqk4,ikidd,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:11:29 2015 UTC,Novak makes adaptors for most transmissions to SBC engines. Don't have to swap drive train.
Jeep,3deqk4,BRMD_xRipx,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:24:55 2015 UTC,"You absolutely DO need to. Not because of compatibility. He has an AMC 20 rear end and a Dana 30 front. Not sure which tranny but it doesn't matter because these CANNOT handle V8 torque. Not his axles, not his tranny (unless he has an auto, which is possible but unlikely) The only part of his drive line that can is his Dana 300 transfer case. If you're gonna do it, do it right."
Jeep,3deqk4,ikidd,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:37:28 2015 UTC,"Well, I see where you were coming from there now.  I don't see where OP states what he's using it for other than DD, or what the transmission is, though I know some of them came with the T4 or T5 which is a shitty little manual.  The transfer case will be a 300 which has no strength disadvantage. The AMC 20 is quite strong if you replace the shafts with one-piece.  It has a bigger and heavier gear set than the D44.    I've wheeled in my 77 with the stock shafts quite handily, but no extreme crawling or anything, and I don't drive like an idiot.  Lord knows my TH400 would take a V8 with no problem.  I'm with you on the BT4 swap though.  800lbs dry is nothing to put in a poor little CJ.  I've seen a bunch of 3.3T swaps and 300 ft-lbs for the weight of a 4.2 seems pretty cool."
Jeep,3deqk4,BRMD_xRipx,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:51:08 2015 UTC,"The AMC 20 may have a big gear,  but there is no way it can handle V8 torque. The AMC 20's weakness is its housing, and it's a BAD weakness. An axle is only as strong as its weakest part, and that housing is weak, very weak. But I see your point. If it's a DD, there's no problem. Don't know why you'd DD a CJ7 without wheeling it though,  lol."
Jeep,3deqk4,ikidd,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:13:13 2015 UTC,"Don't know why you'd DD a CJ7 without wheeling it though, lol.   Old school cool.  I get so many comments when I drive around the city, it's ridiculous.  A prettified old CJ brings all the gearheads and tirebiters out.  Besides, wheeling one of these old bastards stock reveals a lot of shortfalls, not to mention age issues.  I was pumping river water out of the diffs and tranny last time I went out and got sunk when a river crossing shorted out the ignition."

Jeep,3deqk4,1TONcherk,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:39:03 2015 UTC,I always thought a hopped up stroker with a 4.0 block/ head and a small 4bbl carb would be cool in a CJ.
Jeep,3deqk4,cramer_cj7,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:29:29 2015 UTC,"I'm doing this exact swap in my 84 cj7 and although expensive it's not that hard. The hardest part is trying to figure out measurements and things but pm me, send me your number and I will send you whatever pictures and show you what I did to get an idea. Look through my post history and you can see some of the progress. Looking back at it I could have saved a ton of money just having the inline 6 rebuilt.... However when it's all done I will be stoked"

Jeep,3dgcq5,cleancutmover,2,Thu Jul 16 01:32:45 2015 UTC,"I don't know about parts compatibility, but I just put an OEM LUK clutch master setup from rockauto for less what they are charging for dorman."
Jeep,3dgcq5,1TONcherk,2,Thu Jul 16 07:21:32 2015 UTC,Can you get pictures of the master in place?  This looks exactly like the one I replace in my 1999 Tj Sahara. It says its compatible for my 1999 also.  I'm not sure if they did something weird in '04. The tubing for mine snakes along the fire wall to the frame of the jeep the makes a U-Turn to the slave cylinder. Edit: I thought my master and slave cylinders were self bleeding but Beware! Only my slave cylinder was -_-   It was a rookie mistake by me.
Jeep,3debhv,sbujrb,3,Wed Jul 15 16:33:56 2015 UTC,"Is it a lot? The 3.8L is known to eat oil, so if it's minimal amounts it's probably normal."
Jeep,3debhv,Kiriesh,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:59:40 2015 UTC,"Its pretty minimal, so I guess it is normal. I knew there was no way I blew the rings on the pistons, but I worry about it everynow and again."
Jeep,3debhv,novajk,2,Wed Jul 15 19:34:18 2015 UTC,"My '07 JK, 3.8L also, uses some oil too. Not much, maybe 1 1/2 quarts in my 5k oil change schedule. Still acceptable with 131,000 miles on the clock! If you talk to Jeep, they will tell you the normal is one quart per 1000 miles for the 3.8L. I have a friend that bought a new '11 that started using oil, so he took it to the dealer several times to try to get it fixed under his warranty...they basically told him to pound sand! He has since traded up to a '14 with the 3.6L"
Jeep,3debhv,1TONcherk,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:01:33 2015 UTC,"Whats the oil change interval and how often does it need a quart? Personally, if it runs good, and is less then a quart low after 3000 miles, id just run it. No way its leaking a significant amount if there is just a 'stain' by the gasket."
Jeep,3debhv,ConvertsToMetric,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:54:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah its approximately 3k miles between oil changes. I keep it on a 3 month cycle so sometimes its done around 2500. So basically anywhere between ~2500-3000 miles. In that time I'll put in maybe 2 or 3 quarts. Sometimes less, think I can just run it?"
