When I first learned about it I was about 4 years old and as we know 4 year olds aren't the most reliable source of information. My mom thought I made it up because the name sounded too weird to be real. She only learned that it was a real thing a year or so ago.

Dinosaurs,3e0a71,sassybluewhale,11,Mon Jul 20 23:35:38 2015 UTC,"Tracks have been found that seem to show multiple predators traveling together, suggesting cooperative hunting behavior. Different species working together would have been unlikely. A symbiotic relationship between species would be possible though."
Dinosaurs,3e0a71,SleepWouldBeNice,3,Tue Jul 21 00:35:49 2015 UTC,How do they know they were travelling together rather using the same prehistoric game trail?
Dinosaurs,3e0a71,sassybluewhale,3,Tue Jul 21 11:27:10 2015 UTC,"I suppose the tracks seem to have been put down at roughly the same time, although I'm sure that would be hard to prove considering how old they are. One line of evidence we have for herd behavior in herbivorous dinosaurs is that the tracks not only line up together, but seem to change direction simultaneously, implying coordinated herd movement."
Dinosaurs,3e0a71,manypixors,7,Tue Jul 21 16:31:51 2015 UTC,"If I’m wrong I hope someone shows up to correct me.   The only inter species cooperation that we have plausible evidence for are big herbivores herding together. I think we have trackways of different species, where sometimes A’s prints are on top of B’s, and in the same trackway you can find B’s on top of A’s? This suggests they were travelling together, not just one species coming along a few hours after another. We can speculate they did this to deter predators (cooperation), but they may have just been going to the same place at the same time.   I’m pretty sure that’s all we’ve got. There’s definitely no evidence for 2 species of predators working together in order to hunt. There’s scrappy evidence for INTRA species cooperation: we think Deinonychus (what JP calls raptors) may have hunted in packs, but it’s still argued over. There are trackways around the world suggesting that dromaeosaurs (the group that Deinonychus comes from) happily travelled in groups, but we can’t yet say for sure whether any given group actually cooperated to hunt.   I’m not sure of this next point, but I don’t thing we even see interspecies hunting cooperation in animals alive today? We see ‘feeding aggregates’, when 2 or more species opportunistically attack the same thing because it was there, but actual cooperation? Like, the way lions coordinate between each other? I don’t think that exists"

Dinosaurs,3e0a71,Thor_Odin_Son,5,Tue Jul 21 02:00:57 2015 UTC,Are...are you sure? Cuz there was quite a bit of gravity in that film.
Dinosaurs,3e0a71,In_Medias_Res,10,Tue Jul 21 04:56:30 2015 UTC,Did you see the bit where the Pteranodon fell and smashed through several structures that were probably built to withstand a tropical storm? Or when it hovered in the air by sheer virtue of flapping its wings? Or most things the Mosasaurus did? Even that film's depiction of gravity was scientifically inaccurate.
Dinosaurs,3e0a71,el_gumbo,2,Tue Jul 21 05:21:01 2015 UTC,It was awesome though.
Dinosaurs,3e0a71,In_Medias_Res,-2,Tue Jul 21 08:02:27 2015 UTC,"Visually, that last sequence, the first Mosasaurus scene, and the introductory shot of the resort were awesome. However, the rest of the movie was anything but. The pterosaurs and everything around their rampage just looked like garbage; the ""gentle giants"" valley and their stampede gave the viewers enough of a view to want to see more of the dinosaurs but then focussed exclusively on the kids; the Tyrannosaurus looked somehow faker than the models in the original trilogy (even though she's the one from the original movie); and the raptors always looked like angry salamanders. As for everything else about that movie (writing, acting, soundtrack), well there's a reason I led with ""visually"".  All around, that movie was a colossal disappointment which masked its mediocrity a fifteen minute monster mash, which was apparently sufficient for most people based on reviews I've seen. I get it, people have every right to enjoy that movie, but I'm not going to pretend it was a good movie because it just about broke my heart."

Dinosaurs,3e0a71,RedditDogie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:28:56 2015 UTC,"I assume you haven't read the original book about JP? The story goes that John Hammond and iNGen want to create theme park monsters, not dinosaurs. The movie never aimed for scientific accuracy."
Dinosaurs,3e0a71,In_Medias_Res,2,Tue Jul 21 20:20:39 2015 UTC,"I have read the book, several times in fact, and that's literally the opposite of what happens. In the novel, Dr. Wu tries to convince John Hammond to make the dinosaurs more true to their media depictions by slowing them down, which Hammond refuses to do for the sake of being true to nature. The dinosaurs in the park in the novel are supposed to be as true to life as possible given their in-universe genetic engineering.  It was also used as part of the theme of playing God by trying to control nature and phenomena which could, by definition, not be controlled. In Jurassic World, they bring up this idea to handwave the inaccuracy of the animals in their park, and throw every major theme from Jurassic Park out the window.  As for not aiming for scientific accuracy, that's all well and good, but maybe they should have not taken up the torch of a franchise that had been lauded for its realistic portrayals of dinosaurs. They also went out of their way to justify the science in the movie and billed the film as having accurate dinosaurs in the promotional material. If they weren't aiming for scientific accuracy, they weren't making a Jurassic Park movie."
Dinosaurs,3e0a71,RedditDogie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:33:39 2015 UTC,"As far as I know the Jurassic Park franchise was never considered too science-y, more like entertainment. They obviously weren't too serious with the latest one because of the theropods teaming up and such. The 'genius' insect in an amber theory is false (obviously) and in light of Jurassic World's release, Jack Horner got some light to clarify the amber theory state as false.   Remember that the franchise is still fiction, and should be taken with a grain of salt science-wise."
Dinosaurs,3e0a71,In_Medias_Res,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:13:03 2015 UTC,"The original Jurassic Park movie was the first major film to depict dinosaurs in painstaking detail. The original movies have always been considered scientifically accurate, as were the novels. The mosquito-in-amber method was the only concept that everyone admitted was outside the realm of possibility.  I'm all for taking movies with a grain of salt, but Jurassic Park was a franchise that began with a clear set of themes and values and stuck to them for three films & two novels. Jurassic World threw all of those themes and values out the window in favour of an action movie with nothing in common to the original series but a setting and some lazy parallels & shoutouts to the original.  Also remember that this fiction is a franchise, and instalments in a franchise are expected to maintain at least a little bit of continuity. Quentin Tarantino films, for example, have little to do with each other besides gratuitous violence, revenge, and pulp-style writing. In this sense, Inglorious Basterds is an appropriate instalment to a franchise which also includes Pulp Fiction and Django Unchained because it contains these elements. However, Inglorious Basterds is not an appropriate instalment to the same franchise that includes Schindler's List or The Monuments Men just because they share similar conflicts and settings. By extension, it makes no sense to argue that Jurassic World belongs in the same franchise as Jurassic Park."

You have seen the previous Jurassic park films right?  JW was actually good compared to a lot of that.  I did find it comical how half of the premise was repeating the mistakes of the first film."
Dinosaurs,3e0a71,Christian661,4,Tue Jul 21 18:32:57 2015 UTC,I think in the movie the raptor was just protecting Owen. Had it been a wild raptor it probably would have ran from the rex fight or taken the opportunity to attack the humans. In real life I'm not sure if there's anyway to know if different species worked together. I'm sure some species had mutually beneficial relationships but I dunno about different species helping each other in fights.

Dinosaurs,3dwwu6,The_Shreckoning,7,Mon Jul 20 05:21:53 2015 UTC,"Many land-based carnivores develop potent bacterial colonies in their mouths, due to bits of flesh getting trapped between their teeth and decaying in there. Carnivoran mammals don't have this - their saliva has an antibacterial agent because they use it to clean their wounds - but they're an exception.  It's likely Tyrannosaurus may have had something along these lines, but I doubt it would have been as deadly as what you're probably thinking of - a Komodo dragon's bite. Komodo dragons deliver anticoagulant venom in addition to the bacterial cocktail, and it's that combination which is so brutal - the wounds can't heal, so massive and swift infection is inevitable.  There's no indication Tyrannosaurus had any kind of venom gland, and dinosaurs were generally pretty good at dealing with infection, so it wouldn't have the same effect on, say, Triceratops, as a Komodo dragon's bite has on a deer. Tyrannosaurus killed its prey by shock, inflicting massive tissue loss with the sheer power of its bite.  When Tyrannosaurus exerted full bite force, it could break cleanly through dense bone. Much more powerful per square inch than any animal living today, and that's before you take into account the massive size of its gape, the elephantine body weight it could throw into shaking its prey, and the simultaneously crushing and bladelike shape of its teeth."
Dinosaurs,3dwwu6,CountVertigo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:56:39 2015 UTC,"The dragon's venom glands weren't known or understood until recently, that might be why it was assumed the ability might be found in other animals.  I remember having a children's book that said maybe Tyrannosaurus had this ability, but it was a huge book full of speculation and it didn't actually back up the claim with any evidence."
Dinosaurs,3dwwu6,Evolving_Dore,5,Mon Jul 20 18:01:19 2015 UTC,"You talking about JFC? JFC isn't really the most accurate show really. Nanotyrannus is now thought just to be a juvenile T-rex.  Also, I think I read somewhere that the bite force of T-rex is around 15-20 tons? Sounds kind of crazy to me, so don't quote me on that."
Dinosaurs,3dwwu6,albinogomora,2,Mon Jul 20 05:45:00 2015 UTC,"12,800 lbs last I read, so somewhere over 6 tons.  Of course it would vary with sifferent animals."
Dinosaurs,3dwwu6,Evolving_Dore,3,Mon Jul 20 17:58:49 2015 UTC,"The status of Nanotyrannus is in dispute. I recently read a morphology breakdown, and it seems quite unlikely for them to be the same species."

I have been collecting fossils since I was 8-9, and now have a pretty decent collection of brachiopods, petrified wood, nautilus, and leaf imprint fossils fromo my trips to the mid-west. Won a Nat Geo essay contest and a trip to Montana when I was 11, and was lucky enough to participate in a dino dig out there. I got to help excavate some hadrosaur remains, and saw a Daspletosaurus tooth.  Will start posting pics and things soon to make up for my dumb gaming videos."

Dinosaurs,3dwuk9,kindageeky44,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:57:44 2015 UTC,"Well, the content of this subreddit is mainly paleontology news (different subreddit for it too), serious dino art, lightweight dino art and serious discussions about dinosaurs. Not serious like ""Spinosaurus vs. Tyrannosaurus"", instead serious like ""What allowed dinosaurs to exist because of their huge size and it's relations to physics."" (Answer: hollow bones, afaik).  This subreddit is focused for dinosaur enthusiasts, I guess."
Dinosaurs,3dwuk9,RedditDogie,2,Mon Jul 20 06:52:29 2015 UTC,That's awesome! I didn't know about the hollow bones part. Though I suppose that allowed something like the brontosaurus to support it's entire neck/head?   Question - feathers. Is that true? I've read that some birds have an evolutionary link to dinosaurs (not sure how they determined that). I also read that some dinosaurs such as raptors had small 'holes' in their bones that would have allowed feathers to adhere to them.  Sorry if my questions seem basic - I haven't studied dinosaurs much at all I'm afraid
Dinosaurs,3dwuk9,RedditDogie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:58:37 2015 UTC,"It's okay. We are happy to help. Also, don't take my words for granted, it's just one opinion and I could remember it wrong.   Anyways, here goes: velociraptors were very much like modern turkeys, with snouts, claws and a big tail. They were completely covered by some kind of primitive feathers (quills? I could be very well wrong), and big meat-eating dinosaurs, ex. Tyrannosaurus probably had some kind of fur for insulation.  Source: this subreddit + my bad memory  EDIT: so when you hear someone say that dinosaurs had feathers you can be a smartass and add ""primitive"" to it. It's actually pretty important because they were more like quills or fur than actual feathers that our current birds wear."
Dinosaurs,3dwuk9,AntiMetter,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:38:27 2015 UTC,"Velociraptor actually belonged to a group of dinosaurs called Deinonychosauria that had pretty much modern feathers, not just simple protofeathers. Unless my memory fails me, they actually had all the feather types found in modern birds. And yes, they actually had ""wings"", that is to say, large pennaceous feathers attached to the forearm, hand and the middle digit just like modern birds have (although modern birds have a bit more elegant set of feathers). So basically Velociraptor and its kin would have looked like big beefy flightless versions of Archaeopteryx, the first bird.  Tyrannosaurs also had primitive feathers or protofeathers, that were probably hair-like in appearance. No dinosaur had fur, as in mammalian hair, which are structurally very different from the integument found in various archosaurs."
Dinosaurs,3dwuk9,RedditDogie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:01:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks again. I knew that raptors had more developed feathers than some other theropods and they were very close to our current day birds, I couldn't word it right but you did."
Dinosaurs,3dwuk9,chubbyfluff,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:23:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, numerous theropod dinosaurs (such as T.rex, velociraptor, therizinosaurus - basically the ones walking on two legs) have been found with fossilized feathers, confirming that they are indeed related to birds. (skeletal structure + hollow bones also give it away).    I also read that some dinosaurs such as raptors had small 'holes' in their bones that would have allowed feathers to adhere to them.   Velociraptor was found with six quill knobs on its forearms, which are locations where feathers are anchored to bone. This is how we also know it was feathered.  And another fun fact - pterosaurs (which are actually not dinosaurs, but a different type of reptile) were covered in fur, according to fossil evidence we found.   For accurate paleoart I suggest looking up Mark Witton and Emily Willoughby, just to give you an idea of what a real dinosaur/pterosaur looked like."
Dinosaurs,3dwuk9,RedditDogie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:43:12 2015 UTC,Thank you man. A much more advanced answer always adds to the discussion.
Dinosaurs,3dwuk9,AntiMetter,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:48:45 2015 UTC,"To put this as simply as possible: birds are a kind of theropod dinosaur that evolved from a close common ancestor with Velociraptor. So all birds are not only equally linked to dinosaurs, they are dinosaurs in much the same way that all bats are mammals. Unfortunately this often gets confused in the popular media, which has among many other things tried to convince people that chickens evolved directly from Tyrannosaurus rex. This stems from a misunderstanding of study results that compared some exceptionally well preserved Tyrannosaurus collagen with that of modern animals, and as far as I know (I can't access the paper to check) the only avian sample came from a chicken. All it actually showed was that Tyrannosaurus collagen was closest to that of modern birds rather than reptiles, mammals or amphibians."

Dinosaurs,3dqf95,j0nosaurus,17,Sat Jul 18 13:14:37 2015 UTC,"I would imagine the sauropods only evolved to have necks long enough to reach the food of the trees that grew to be so big due to the large amounts of oxygen in the atmosphere at there time and were not longer than this. Therefore the trees in their environment would be as tall if not taller than them and be struck more than them. However if they were to be caught in a field during a lightning storm if would be a different story. But, a giraffe in a field is just as much a quicker path to the ground. I feel like these animals would have evolved early on to move to the right places during a storm. One thing is for sure though, you know it happened. Cool question, and I could easily be wrong."
Dinosaurs,3dqf95,i_like_outer_space,12,Sat Jul 18 13:52:52 2015 UTC,"I would imagine the sauropods only evolved to have necks long enough to reach the food of the trees that grew to be so big due to the large amounts of oxygen in the atmosphere at there time and were not longer than this.   Trees don't breathe oxygen, they give it off as a waste product. Plants use carbon dioxide and will grow better with a bit more of it, which is why some greenhouses may add more of the gas to their air to promote growth.  Trees don't automatically try to grow as tall as possible though, they've evolved to live in certain environments and certain heights and shapes do better in some places than others; Rainforest plants try to grow as tall as possible so that they can get their leaves out of the shadows of the plants around them, which are all competing for sunlight. Desert plants may try to do the opposite so that they don't burn up in the intense sunlight or so that they don't lose too much water do to having more surface area.  So it's not the height of the trees that the sauropods needed long necks for, the necks of many species weren't even able to be lifted very high, their bones show that they just weren't made for lifting their necks way up in the air.  There is a good idea going around though that they had long necks to increase the area that the animal could feed from without moving; When you're 90 feet long and you weigh several tons, moving takes a lot of energy and it can be dangerous if you were to stumble, so having a long neck that allows you to reach a lot more ground without having to pick up your feet is a really nice trait to have.  You can read more about this on the Sauropod Vertebra Picture of the Week blog, which is an amazing source of information about sauropods.    As for sauropods getting struck by lighting, I'll say that it probably did happen as animals today are struck by lightning all the time.  There really wouldn't be a safe place for the largest sauropods to hide and in modern times, hiding under trees can lead to whole herds of animals being killed by lightning striking the sheltering tree. I have no doubt that some dinosaurs would have met similar fates while clustering under trees during lightning storms."

Dinosaurs,3dqf95,newaccount,2,Sat Jul 18 19:22:42 2015 UTC,It's mentioned in the comments that quadrupeds die more often to this than bi-peds because the lightning goes up one set of legs then through the body - exiting out the other set. Which is also interesting in light of dinosaur strikes.

Dinosaurs,3dodbn,TheKolbrin,5,Sat Jul 18 03:46:15 2015 UTC,"I met him a few years ago in college where we quickly became close friends due to our mutual appreciation for dorky things like Pokemon and bad puns. After some issues with our program and some financial setbacks, he decided to leave after the first semester of our program and move back home, which absolutely sucked. We ended up growing a bit apart during that time, until he got his ducks in a row and waddled his way back to school to work on film a year and a half later, starting off with a year of open studies to prep himself for the audition process and get his marks up. He worked his ass off and got a spot as a third-year student in the program.  During that time, he entered into a great relationship with an old classmate of ours. They later moved in together and are now engaged. They also found a stray cat outside of their home and took him in, who happens to be the only cat who doesn't trigger my allergies (This is a picture of the cat I took. His name is Hobie.)  While I decided to go in a different route with my career (EMT/Paramedic), he stayed back in the town we first met to go to school there, and I moved back to the city. I've got a mild mental condition called bipolar type II. He and his fiancee have helped me by letting me use their house as a sanctuary when I'm having a down spell and I need to get out of the city. I would drive 90 minutes just to see them and stay at their home, which cleared my mind. It was a great way for me to cope with the depressive states, and they never complained if I was a nuisance. It was a nice way for us to rekindle the strong friendship that we had.  He recently graduated from his program and has been working on these videos to show what he has learned while discussing a great passion of his - dinosaurs. Him and his fiancee have done a lot for me as I learn to cope with my mental issues without them knowing. I'm hoping a big spike in viewership is one thing that can really brighten their day.  TL;DR: Friend from college has helped me cope with mental issues by letting me stay in his home for sanctuary and is celebrating 1000 views on a video he made about paleo-art. I'm hoping a few extra views will make him giddy.  EDIT: Forgot to add promised picture of the cat.  EDIT II: I'd also like to add that I have as much knowledge as Jon Snow when it comes to dinosaurs. The first thing I think of when I hear ""paleo"" is the diet."

A T. rex or Velociraptor fossil will go for a lot just because of the name, and plenty of stuff will be sold under those names which aren't from those species.  I don't know anything about huge fossils like an entire Stegosaur plate, but you can definitely amass a nice collection of decent fossils for only a few hundred dollars total.  Theropod teeth from Morocco are common and can be bought for around $30, bone fragments from American digs can go for under $10 (but they won't be very nice).  This is where the ethics and black market issues start to become important, and I don't know enough about that to say."

Some countries, like Italy and South Africa, ban the ownership of fossils found in those countries, but allow you to own foreign ones.  Bone fragments can be had for cheap, so can Moroccan dinosaur teeth, but beware composited, heavily restored or fake ones. If you want a tyrannosaur fossil, a complete T. rex tooth will cost hundreds or thousands but ""Nanotyrannus"" teeth and sections of T. rex teeth can be had for much cheaper. North American herbivore teeth are easily acquirable as well."

There's very little evidence to support Giganotosaurus was bigger than T.rex, and even less evidence for Carcharodontosaurus.  http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/06/uk-science-dinosaurs-idINKBN0DM1L220140506  With Spinosaurus, chances are high it is longer due to how its built, but it was shorter in height and also probably lighter in weight than T.rex. Giganotosaurus is so incomplete that it's hard to say. We know the legs of Giganotosaurus are less robust and a smidge shorter than T.rex's legs. Carcharodontosaurus is silly since we barely have a skull. You can say anything about the size of the animal with so little material.  I don't know if T.rex is the biggest, but the evidence provided so far aren't as definitive as you'd think. It's mainly media hype than actual science."

Dinosaurs,3d9wow,Evolving_Dore,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:03:42 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit late but my guess is that all these carnivores (except Spino because different lifestyle) were probably around the same size and all had comparable variation.  One holotype doesn't make Giganotosaurus larger than T. rex, but it does put it up on the same scale.  I doubt any bipedal terrestrial Theropod will ever prove to be consistently larger than T. rex or Giganotosaurus, it just seems like they reached a threshold that can't be crossed."
Dinosaurs,3d9wow,Blekanly,4,Fri Jul 17 23:12:01 2015 UTC,Hard to say. It's even possible that there exists a tyrannosaurine that's bigger than T.rex.
Dinosaurs,3d9wow,cbleslie,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:48:33 2015 UTC,"I never understood the obsession with ""bigger than t-rex"", the predators that tended to be bigger also hunted larger prey, t-rex hunted prey of similar size to itself and had a more compact build.

While many species have been classified in the genus Iguanodon, dating from the late Jurassic Period to the late Cretaceous Period of Asia, Europe, and North America, research in the first decade of the 21st century suggests that there is only one well-substantiated species: I. bernissartensis, which lived from the late Barremian to the earliest Aptian ages  (Early Cretaceous) in Belgium and possibly elsewhere in Europe, between about 126 and 125 million years ago. Iguanodon were large, bulky herbivores. Distinctive features include large thumb spikes, which were possibly used for defense against predators, combined with long prehensile fifth fingers able to forage for food.

Dinosaurs,3cypx3,scribbleonthewall,2,Sun Jul 12 22:09:01 2015 UTC,"There is a vast number of genera known only from teeth or the occasional isolated bone. It's very rare to be able to eventually match these fragmentary remains to a more complete specimen as the science evolves, Troodon is one of the few examples of a tooth genus for which decent remains were eventually found.  If you really want a list of named ichnogenera, there's one here. Mostly, a stray tooth will just be referred to as ""the X-formation dromaeosaur"" or similar, or by the fossil's reference number.    If you want to know which well-known dinosaurs have the least remains, it's always the earliest discoveries, which typically come from Britain, where articulated skeletons are incredibly rare. The original Iguanodon has to be #1, it's basically only known from teeth. Since the millenium, the genus has been reassigned to a similar animal well-known from a mass burial site in Belgium; Gideon Mantell's historic Iguanodon is now known as Therosaurus.  Amphicoelias fragilimus is another good example - known from just one bone which has since been lost, but allegedly the largest land animal - potentially a contender for largest animal - ever known. More likely, though, it just wasn't accurately described."

For instance only one nearly complete skeleton of Spinosaurus  was found but it was destroyed in WWII. Since then they have only found about 10% of it's fossils. So despite all the documentaries and shows about it, everything about it, except for teeth, is pure speculation."

Dinosaurs,3cypx3,Evolving_Dore,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:55:50 2015 UTC,"Spinosaurus isn’t done changing. The new subadult described by Ibrahim and colleagues fills in parts of the dinosaur’s skeleton that have been a total mystery until now, but the fact remains that most of the new reconstruction is assembled from bits and pieces of various dinosaurs. It’s a hypothesis. Spinosaurus was undoubtedly a spectacular dinosaur, but just how strange this prehistoric piscivore truly was is a secret still held tight by the fossil record.   That is the last paragraph of the article you linked. Spinosaurus is still 85% hypothesis. Spinosaurus has very little definitive evidence, very little fossil proof. The ""big reveal"" last year was fascinating but it's still filling in gaps with more speculation.   Speculation and hypothesis is an important part of Paleontology, but right now I'm only interested in Dinosaurs with near complete fossil skeletons."

Dinosaurs,3cuzeb,atmdk7,12,Sat Jul 11 00:11:06 2015 UTC,"Intern with Eastern North American paleontologists (North Carolina). Here in the east there are several factors that make determining what the Creataceous was like hard.   There is a LOT of vegetation, and one can not excavate vegetation, which is why badlands and quarries are where fossils are mainly found. The rock layers are not usually Creataceous, at least in NC, VA, SC, and GA.  Here we get Triassic and marine Cenozoic. The North Eastern U.S. is very populated with cities or has lots of vegetation as aforementioned, and Canada has cities in the east and many forests.  Southeast is a lot of vegetation, and wrong rock age.   Those are the reasons I can think of now, I don't work a lot with Creataceous so can't help much more than that at the moment, will edit with more information if I find any.  Edit: It appears there were angiosperms taking hold well with forest common."

Dinosaurs,3cuzeb,Western2486,2,Mon Jul 13 19:37:13 2015 UTC,I know coastal VA used to be underwater (though I'm not sure if that was the case in the time period you asked about).
Dinosaurs,3cuzeb,octaffle,2,Sat Jul 11 20:59:59 2015 UTC,"I have heard that the unfortunate truth is that the Pleistocene glaciation destroyed most of the stratigraphic layers of Eastern North America, including the late Cretaceous. There are some formations that offer a window into the lost world of Appalachia; it has been surmised that the Tyrannosaurids (including Dryptosaurus) had longer forelimbs and that Nodosaurids were more common than in Laramidia."

Dinosaurs,3chmly,Sthenno,2,Wed Jul 8 21:28:55 2015 UTC,"I remember a Discovery doc about velociraptors from some time ago that used pretty earthy names for their ""characters"".

Dinosaurs,3cdfks,fableal,3,Sat Jul 11 14:11:07 2015 UTC,"The feathers that existed on dinosaurs were not the feathers we see on birfs today.  They were more like the down feathers or ""feathers"" of a young chicken.  Speculation of course."
Dinosaurs,3cdfks,buddomatic,9,Tue Jul 7 02:11:52 2015 UTC,"No, that is true. In its early stages feathers looked a lot more like fur (thing like an Emu or a Kiwi), because they accomplished the same thing, which is insulation. Pennaceous feathers evolved much later probably for mating displays, and only then for flying/gliding or slowing down a fall. Velociraptor has also been proven to have had those pennaceous feathers attached to its arms, probably for the same reasons (minus flight)"
Dinosaurs,3cdfks,chubbyfluff,2,Tue Jul 7 06:49:07 2015 UTC,"Generally agreed, but a few little points:   We find pennaceous feathers at the same time as the oldest known fuzzy theropods. They're much more derived dinosaurs, but major evolutionary changes seemed to be happening very rapidly around that point in the tree. Pennaceous feathers may also have evolved for brooding nests (providing a shading fan), which even the larger maniraptorans seem to have done."
Dinosaurs,3cdfks,CountVertigo,-1,Wed Jul 8 00:16:51 2015 UTC,"No. I am sorry but that is flat-out wrong. First off, birds ARE dinosaurs, so your entire statement is nonsensical, but even assuming that you mean non-avian dinosaurs, it still does not make sense. We know that deinonychosaurians had pennaceous feathers, we know that Ornithomimids had them, and we have evidence that Oviraptorosaurs had them. In fact, Even tyrannosaurs may have had them on some parts of their bodies."
Dinosaurs,3cdfks,Paleoloxodon,0,Tue Jul 7 13:08:47 2015 UTC,"I love feathers on dinosaurs! I get very annoyed when a theropod dinosaur isn't portrayed with feathers.

Dinosaurs,3cffpg,Firecaller,4,Tue Jul 7 14:24:36 2015 UTC,"OK, lets take a few steps back here. Yeah, the square cube law means that as things get linearly larger, they get heavier much faster. But there's no reason to think that intrinsically stops a large animal existing. Why must a Tyrannosaurus not be viable just because of this law - which biological feature (bones, muscles, gas exchange) do you think is is breaking which physical law and at what size?"
Dinosaurs,3cffpg,davehone,5,Tue Jul 7 16:56:30 2015 UTC,"Dinosaurs were very lightly built, thanks to hollow bones and other birdy characteristics. So they weren't as heavy as a mammal of the same size would be."
Dinosaurs,3cffpg,Retoeli,3,Tue Jul 7 21:16:49 2015 UTC,"Like their avian relatives, non-avian dinosaurs had hollow bones and a very efficient respiratory system with air sacs around the body, which makes them weigh less than mammals of comparable size, and more efficient at exchanging gases. This allowed them to get much bigger than the largest land mammals, which is why most sauropods were so much bigger than proboscideans and indricotheres."

Just like how Wu says (in the book) that people ""don't want real dinosaurs; they want something that meets their expectations,"" the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park were engineered to be show-worthy.  Which explains everything ""wrong"" with the dinosaurs (T. Rex is an intimidating predator, Velociraptor is a two-meter tall featherless theropod, and even the Spinosaurus being bipedal with strong rear legs after years later it was shown to be mostly quadrupedal)."
Dinosaurs,3bxar7,Germankipp,5,Fri Jul 3 05:09:34 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Tyrannosaurus is still considered to be a predator by the overall scientific community.

Dinosaurs,3bxar7,rhetoric_trex,2,Sat Jul 4 05:54:47 2015 UTC,"It's kinda hard to illustrate with a T. rex, but this is the hands' resting position (""palms"" facing each other) and this is what they would look pronated (""palms"" facing the ground), except that theropods can't twist their ulna relative to their radius the way humans can."

Also, all the inaccuracies in the dinosaurs are explained in Jurassic World. When defending Indominus, Dr. Wu said that none of their dinosaurs had ever been purebred, with genes from different species spliced in and modified from the very beginning. He said that the actual historical dinosaurs would look very different, implying he removed the feathers, upped the size of some things and had to modify everything at least a little, to make it possible to bring them back at all.

Dinosaurs,3buo9n,suparokr,8,Thu Jul 2 08:15:08 2015 UTC,Just realized a dinosaur documentary with David Attenborough would be cool. Does anyone have any suggestions?
Dinosaurs,3buo9n,FreakyJk,3,Thu Jul 2 11:52:47 2015 UTC,He has a documentary called The Life of Birds on Netflix in which he discusses Pterosaurs and early bird evolution.  Not quite a dino documentary but it was interesting.
Dinosaurs,3buo9n,Evolving_Dore,3,Thu Jul 2 16:50:40 2015 UTC,"There's a great NOVA documentary about this animal called ""The Four Winged Dinosaur"".  I think it is on Youtube, or the PBS website.  It's a few years old now, but it does a great job of describing the (sometimes conflicting) research of different paleontologists in regard to Microraptor.  They do some high tech aerodynamic tests to reveal the animal's probable flying abilities, and they also do a great job of showing how we know what its leg feathers were for.  It is worth a watch for anyone interested.  It also includes the late Farish Jenkins, one of the great paleontologists of our time."
Dinosaurs,3buo9n,stenops,2,Fri Jul 3 03:41:19 2015 UTC,Microraptor was awesome. Not to hijack your thread but here is a link to one I commissioned a year ago.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Dinosaurs/comments/26bg2h/dino_art_i_commissioned_uxenorat_to_make_a/  Definitely a favorite add to my display case.

Dinosaurs,3bqte7,CestMoiIci,5,Wed Jul 1 12:09:39 2015 UTC,"I'v always considered the possibility of a thin layer of skin stretching between the dorsal spines, packed with blood vessels, would allow for easy heat loss. This may have been vital in Mesozoic North Africa where it would have presumably been very hot.  A similar adaptation can be seen in African Elephants, in that there ears have very large surface area to volume ratio and also having plenty of blood vessels, which allows them to lose heat. Asian Elephants in colder parts of the world lack this adaptation as they do not need to loose any excess heat."
Dinosaurs,3bqte7,Bilbz-Oner,6,Thu Jul 2 05:04:57 2015 UTC,"Similar shaped neural spines can be found in bison, these spines help support a fleshy lump on the backs of these animals where fat is stored to help the animals through leaner times. I presume it helped them servive during the dry season and was covered in fat. Most likely not the thin sail we see portrayed."
Dinosaurs,3bqte7,DropDead_Slayer,6,Wed Jul 1 12:27:17 2015 UTC,I've heard that there was a sail and that it was used to regulate temperature.
Dinosaurs,3bqte7,Flameknight,5,Wed Jul 1 17:03:01 2015 UTC,"I've heard that as well, but being a warm blooded creature unlike dimetrodon, suggests that the spinosaurids used it for an entirely different reason. When looking at the neural spines in comparison to dimetrodon they are clearly different. Place them next to a bison and it makes you wonder if; had the bison went extinct before humans were around, would we suggest that they had sails as well?"
Dinosaurs,3bqte7,DropDead_Slayer,6,Wed Jul 1 17:17:58 2015 UTC,"Not a professional at all, but it always looks to me that a bison's enlarged neural spines are concentrated in the front, wheras spinosaurus' seems to run down it's whole back. Though perhaps thats so it's over the animal's center of gravity, I always thought it looked like a strange structure as a hump. Hadrosaurs always seemed to fit, not Spinosaurus. Just a thought."
Dinosaurs,3bqte7,atmdk7,2,Wed Jul 1 18:01:06 2015 UTC,"I think that the only reason it seems strange as a hump is due to the name for one, and the fact that we've been shown depictions of a biased opinion. What I am suggesting is not a hump exactly like a bison, though I don't believe it to be a thin sail like dimetrodon either. I believe that it would be thicker than a spine seen on dimetrodon, and more like the rest of the body in coloration as opposed to the hump which rounds it out. These are just my opinions and I might just be wrong, but I don't see a use for a spine besides maybe helping move through water better or to camouflage in the bushes near water."
Dinosaurs,3bqte7,DropDead_Slayer,5,Wed Jul 1 18:29:57 2015 UTC,"So not like a ""see through"" heat-sail type, but more fleshy and thick? Interesting."

Dinosaurs,3bqte7,DropDead_Slayer,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:50:31 2015 UTC,"What's so bad about the thermoregulation theory? Elephants use their ears, an animal this large in a warm climate might have needed something to flush with blood to lose heat. Though I find the idea of the hump really interesting too.  Is it just the amount of bone in it?"
Dinosaurs,3bqte7,formicarium,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:51:25 2015 UTC,"For an animal that spends most of it's time in the water, I just can't see thermoregulation being a necessity. I may be wrong, but I feel the hump would help it survive when the fish they hunt migrate after spawning."
Dinosaurs,3bqte7,DropDead_Slayer,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:58:57 2015 UTC,It's also been theorized that it aided in fishing by creating shade beneath it that could have attracted the saw fish that we have a lot of evidence that they ate. It is also possible however unlikely that they could have used the spines as a literal sail while in the water to move without making as much noise. The pterasaur called Tapejara had a large crest on its head and it is believed that it may have used it in this fashion however strange that may sound.
Dinosaurs,3bqte7,OrgasmickJagger,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:39:47 2015 UTC,"That's bizarre but awesome if it was true, though since it was a fixed hump/sail it sounds less plausible than a crest which can be turned with the head of the animal. The spinosaur might have found itself blowing in strange directions if the sail couldn't be bent."
Dinosaurs,3bqte7,formicarium,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:19:16 2015 UTC,"You know I would have accepted that explanation two days ago, but yesterday I was down at the beach and watched seals floating with their fins sticking out of the water to cool themselves by evaporation (I had to look this up to find out the reason, this isn't my supposition). Sometimes their insulation is too good for them to cool themselves. I imagine that even in water the shear size of a spino might have presented a similar problem."
Dinosaurs,3bqte7,formicarium,5,Sat Jul 4 04:16:33 2015 UTC,"I read just yesterday that the tips of the spines were too thin to support a fatty hump, though that was just from the dinopedia page..."
Dinosaurs,3bqte7,aatencio91,4,Wed Jul 1 18:44:48 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't support a full on hump theory, /u/atmdk put my words above to better meaning with this.   ...not like a ""see through"" heat-sail type, but more fleshy and thick..."
Dinosaurs,3bqte7,DropDead_Slayer,2,Wed Jul 1 18:52:35 2015 UTC,"Current thinking is that it wasn't a hump, but wasn't the paper-thin, pelycosaur-looking sail most people are familiar with, either--possibly for displaying the animal's size and health to potential mates & territorial rivals who would only see the part of the Spinosaurus that's sticking out of the water.  Smithsonian Magazine story with more pictures.  Ibrahim et al. (2014)"
Dinosaurs,3bqte7,LordBojangles,0,Thu Jul 2 22:30:57 2015 UTC,"Spinosaurids were more aquatic than land animals, so the sail likely served the purpose of helping it swim faster. A hump would have been awkward and unnecessary for an animal such as a spino."

Dinosaurs,3blwau,jdmgto,35,Tue Jun 30 13:14:42 2015 UTC,I'd guess mosasaur.  Edit: OP's posting history indicates he is in Texas. Western Interior Seaway seems likely.

Dinosaurs,3blwau,ULiopleurodon,3,Tue Jun 30 13:07:52 2015 UTC,With the tooth shape and stoutness I'd say that's the best guess.

I'd have to see it in person to make a definite diagnosis.  That said, that looks an awful lot like a section of a crocodyliform's (crocodile or close relative) dentary (part of the lower jaw). Are the teeth set in distinct sockets, or do they sit in a groove along the back side?   (on the Velociraptor thing, it is 1) way too big, 2) has teeth completely the wrong shape and size, and 3) I'm guessing was found in North America, while Velociraptor is from Mongolia)"

Dinosaurs,3blwau,treecko4ubers,3,Tue Jun 30 23:29:06 2015 UTC,"Those teeth look pretty conical, so it being any type of theropod (meat eating dinosaur) is pretty unlikely, as conical teeth usually indicate the animal fed on primarily fish.  Spinosaurids ate fish and had teeth shaped like that, but they didn't inhabit the Western landmass that would become North and South America.  I agree with holypiefatman that it is most likely a part of a mosasaur or crocodile jaw, just from how similar it appears to a crocodile jaw at a glance."

Dinosaurs,3blwau,TyrannosaurusSex1859,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:32:08 2015 UTC,"Irritator:        For other meanings see irritation and wikt:irritate.   Irritator is a genus of spinosaurid dinosaur that lived in the early Cretaceous Period (Albian stage), around 110 million years ago. Current estimations indicate a length of 8 meters (26 feet) and a weight of 2-3 tons.  [unreliable source?] It was found in Brazil. Irritator was a theropod with an unusually shaped crest at the rear of its head, and probably ate fish.  So far the only fossil that has been found was an 80 centimeter long fossil skull in the Romualdo Member, a layer member of the Brazilian Santana formation. This skull strongly resembles the skulls of Suchomimus and Spinosaurus. The genus is often regarded today as identical (synonymous) with Angaturama, which lived in the same time and the same place as Irritator.
