ModernMagic,3e2ke1,XVOS,33,Tue Jul 21 13:48:47 2015 UTC,Opt seems like a reasonable can trip for the format.   Council's Judgment is a card I would like to see. I think it's printable on power level but its probably unrealistic to see will of the council in a standard legal set.
ModernMagic,3e2ke1,why_fist_puppies,8,Tue Jul 21 14:16:54 2015 UTC,The problem with Judgement is it's a detention sphere that you can't really do anything about to get your permanent back.
ModernMagic,3e2ke1,Eskimosam,10,Tue Jul 21 14:49:54 2015 UTC,"D sphere isn't exactly taking modern by storm, so I think there's some room for better removal in that type of slot."
ModernMagic,3e2ke1,PricklyPricklyPear,3,Tue Jul 21 15:44:22 2015 UTC,I'm not seeing the problem.
ModernMagic,3e2ke1,EternalPhi,9,Tue Jul 21 15:06:58 2015 UTC,"Mark Rosewater often talks about how that effect goes against white's share of the color pie and he is a big color pie enthusiast.  That isn't to say it is unlikely to be in a standard legal set, just MaRo would probably fight its inclusion.  Edit:  Nowadays white is supposed to have answers (permanent removal) that can be answered e.g. oblivion ring, chain to the rocks.  As opposed to simply removal like path to exile and council's judgment"
ModernMagic,3e2ke1,MEtaphorOWl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:38:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it seems somewhat unlikely given the situational (and frankly low power) nature of the answers Wizards has been printing lately.   I don't think it is a power level concern for Modern, but I can see how they could say it would be for standard. It's better than Maelstrom Pulse in some ways but also weaker in a lot of relevant ways. It would be a very reasonable two of for U/Wx decks I think."
ModernMagic,3e2ke1,why_fist_puppies,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:02:48 2015 UTC,"I think it's about time there's some good permanent removal outside of BG in modern.  Maelstrom Pulse exists, so it's likely not too powerful."

ModernMagic,3e2ke1,22bebo,85,Tue Jul 21 16:27:28 2015 UTC,I think the other issue with Council's Judgment is that design does not like it as it sort of breaks the modern color pie. White's removal is generally not supposed to be better than Black's. So it has some hoops to go through before I could see it getting printed in a modern set.

Therapy with procession/souls would be SO good in modern, but not busted. Great call!  Edit: I never said that Tokens would be the best deck in modern, and I didn't say that the best deck for therapy is tokens. I just said that it would make Tokens a lot better by significantly improving some of its worst matchups.

ModernMagic,3e3lsr,Xeroxorex,2,Wed Jul 22 01:16:25 2015 UTC,"I had the same complaint when I ran that deck.  My solution was to run another color; I'm currently on GWr, with Bolts and Dromoka's Commands.  But if you want to stay mono-white, I think Valorous Stance is about the only white removal I'd maindeck (after the obligatory 4x Path to Exile, of course).  Others have mentioned a few others, but I think they're all pretty marginal.  Dismember gets special mention; it's maindeckable, but I've always hated the 4 life payment, especially against aggro opponents.    Moving to the sideboard, Dismember becomes much more palatable here; you can bring it in only when it's good, against non-aggro decks.  Paying 4 life to stop a Twin combo win feels much better than paying 4 life to kill a Goblin Guide.  I also personally like Sunlance out of the sideboard; it's amazing in the aggro matchups, as it efficiently kills most Modern early threats.  It's just too risky to run maindeck, as the ""nonwhite"" clause makes it a dead card sometimes.  That said, I have seen people run 1 or 2 maindeck."
ModernMagic,3e3lsr,towishimp,0,Tue Jul 21 22:02:05 2015 UTC,"Sunlance is really at its best against wild nacatls, delvers, red creatures, 2/3 tarmogoyfs with a sorcery but no instant, and t1 bolt the birds decks. Other than those and a few others I can't recall at the moment, sunlance is pretty weak. I really like oppressive rays as additional paths, because for most creatures you care about for sunlance, oppressive rays is just as good. (Notable exception being young pyromancer)"
ModernMagic,3e3lsr,Xeroxorex,2,Wed Jul 22 01:21:44 2015 UTC,"You pretty much said what I did. It shines in some matchups, and falls flat in others. Hence, only suitable for the sideboard."
ModernMagic,3e3lsr,towishimp,2,Wed Jul 22 01:57:27 2015 UTC,Valorous stance costing 2 mana is a little bit of a dealbreaker when you're playing a creature based tempo deck. I'd be more comfortable running 1 or 2 rays in the main that you can board out if your meta has few bad matchups for the card and many good ones.
ModernMagic,3e319c,VersusX,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:59:24 2015 UTC,"As others have said, the amount of cheap removal in modern will keep this deck, and others like it, down. If they aren't running cheap removal, they are doing something unfair that this deck isnt going to be able to interact with (Ad Naus, Scapeshift, Goryo's Breach, Bloom Titan).  As the first reply pretty much says: You will be wasting too much time casting equipment and equipping only to be hit with a 1-mana remoal spell before you pass the turn (now tapped out) with nothing to defend yourself with.  As for Bogle, it is a fine deck. It can win a smaller tourny, but it isnt positioned really wel lright now. With the resurgence of Jund, many of these decks are running 4x Liliana of the Veil (which is no good for Bogle).  Edit: Infect is a deck that plays a lot like waht you are trying to do here. The difference is that Infect reacts to their opponent, not the other way around."
ModernMagic,3e319c,IAmGnarles,-1,Tue Jul 21 18:21:35 2015 UTC,"Well, Modern is often described as a turn-3 format. As in, whatever your deck does, you should be all set to do it on or about turn 3. Your deck doesn't seem to have that ability. Darksteel Axe and Loxodon Warhammer are both painfully too slow, and your creatures are going to be outclassed by everything else.  Your creature base also has little resilience to the most-played removal in the format (Bolt), and lose badly to every tier 1 deck's strategy.  I'd think long and hard about what your deck wants to do, and adapt/brew on top of an established deck that does that. It looks like you want to go all in, so Infect is probably closer to your game plan than WW or Soul Sisters. It helps to build and play and read discussion about decks that work similar to how you want yours to work, because it gives you an idea why certain cards are playable and others aren't.  Good luck, and don't forget to run Honor of the Pure if you're planning on actually running this pile of 60."

ModernMagic,3e319c,jamoncito,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:36:53 2015 UTC,"It isn't tier 1 right now but you can certainly take an FNM with it. It's a good deck, but if your meta has a heavy amount of Lilianas present you'll have a hard time."
ModernMagic,3e2c28,JTownsend776,10,Tue Jul 21 12:29:42 2015 UTC,"Vapor Snag is great for tempo strategies, but if you're playing Grixis you have so many options for removal that I don't think you really need it.  What would you remove to make room for it?"
ModernMagic,3e2c28,Phelps-san,3,Tue Jul 21 12:51:15 2015 UTC,"This is all just theory since I haven't had a chance to test yet, but possibly dropping the Izzet Charm from MB (I haven't been very impressed with it) and either  1-2Thoughtseize / 1-2 Staticaster from the SB, neither of which have done a lot of work in my meta so far (which could very well be from me boarding incorrectly). I could see boarding out some number of Git Probes or YPs for the SB snags."
ModernMagic,3e2c28,why_fist_puppies,2,Tue Jul 21 13:06:34 2015 UTC,"I can see either Thoughtseize or Staticaster being lackluster in certain metas. I can't imagine what a meta looks like where both are bad. Is it just Jund and burn or something?   Also, have you considered dismember instead? You don't really want Vapor Snag against aggressive cheap creature decks, so the life loss isn't that relevant, you can mitigate it if you have more mana and you don't have to worry about that creature anymore."
ModernMagic,3e2c28,towishimp,2,Tue Jul 21 14:13:59 2015 UTC,"This is my feeling, too.  UR Delver usually ran it because they lacked better removal options at CMC 1 (after Bolt, obviously).  It particularly needed Snag when it came to creatures that were too big to be Bolted anyways.  If I had a dollar for every time my 3-5 CMC beast got bounced, thus letting a Delver win the damage race, I'd...but I digress.  Bottom line is that Grixis Delver has plenty of options at 1-2 CMC that just straight kill a creature, so why bother bouncing it?  Terminate just seems better.  If you really want something at CMC 1, Dismember and Murderous Cut are both basically CMC 1."
ModernMagic,3e2c28,Kenny_Baker,7,Tue Jul 21 16:07:19 2015 UTC,"Vapor Snag is certainly efficient. The most efficient ""removal"" in blue. However, you're playing black for a reason: the hard removal. It might not be enough to delay a threat when you can destroy it instead.  That said, maybe you could also consider Echoing Truth. It costs an additional mana, but it's more versatile and can get rid of pesky tokens. The only downside is that it doesn't hit manlands.  Definitely test it out. Vapor Snag is quite the tempo play for bigger threats, especially when you already have a Tasigur or Angler pressuring them."
ModernMagic,3e2c28,thegrease,5,Tue Jul 21 12:53:46 2015 UTC,"From my experiance, the more Snapcasters you run, the better Vapor Snag is. If I run 4 Snaps, I always find room for at least 1 Vapor Snag. Vapor Snag, Snap, Vapor Snag can feel just as good as Bolt, Snap, Bolt; especially since delve creatures are popular now, and bouncing them can be as good as killing them."
ModernMagic,3e2c28,dustindblack,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:45:16 2015 UTC,This x 1000  Vapor Snag is also amazing vs the various delve strategy decks that are so popular right now... Spend the first turn or two prepping your graveyard for an early Gurmag Angler? Vapor Snag'd; rekt.
ModernMagic,3e2c28,compacta_d,3,Tue Jul 21 19:00:11 2015 UTC,"in R/U delver vapor snag was a super star for me.  Grix does have options, but snag is very good.  edit- you'll kill ppl with it too. also snagging snapcasters is good."
ModernMagic,3e2c28,notiesitdies,2,Tue Jul 21 16:14:08 2015 UTC,"Before Khans and the treasure cruise craziness, UR Delver ran ~3 copies of vapor snag. After TC got banned the deck shifted to a Grixis shell and dropped snags to pick up Murderous Cut and Tasigur. Black gave delver a couple of things it really needed, efficient robust removal and a cheap resilient beater.  vapor snag is certainly a very strong tempo card. You can even 'buy back' your own snapcasters if you need to flashback something in your yard. If you want to try snag out, it probably fits better in a straight UR shell. Dropping the delve spells puts less strain on your yard so you can pick up something like mainboard grim lavamancers. This can be a good choice in the right meta, but grixis is probably better unless your expecting a LOT of burn, delver, and affinity."
ModernMagic,3e2c28,WiggityWackFlapJack,2,Tue Jul 21 15:44:41 2015 UTC,"I was testing this out last week to less-than-stellar results. It's fine if you're ahead and want to get an efficient finish, but it's soft removal--so it doesn't help you come from behind as much as murderous cut and terminate will.

UG Merfolk may be able to go long by running less creatures. Cutting the silver gills and followers in favor of remand and cryptic command could extend to a more midrange deck.

The argument I've heard is that you can Slam Lords with it Instant Speed End of Turn and Attack.  The deck itself can do that a turn sooner (just not instant speed) without the help of CoCo.   It's not bringing anything to the table as you now take a almost perfect mana base. Up it from 20 to 21-23 Lands for the Curve of a Double Green Spell.   On top of that, If you're looking to Swarm the field just run more Master of Waves. He is the same mana cost. Doesn't require you to fix the mana base. Also leaves cards in your deck for grindy games to then use in later points when your cards you just CoCo'd get wiped off the field.   Sure, it CAN win the turn after you Collected Company but Green literally adds nothing to the table besides Company. There isn't a magical sideboard tech that comes from Green.   I'd rather see someone Splash Red for Lightning Bolt."

My list was a little different than my current one, but the main difference is that my current list has a lower mana curve and a very light black splash which I think is better than running big top end cards like Sphinx's Rev and Mystical Teachings which I feel are very weak with all of the super efficient countermagic and discard running around.

If i dont have an infect dude stick by turn three thats generally a loss to any deck that stabilizes.  Inkmoth is generally an out but molten rain seems too slow to keep up especially if i have a dude in play effectively. You tapping out on my turn 3 or 4 sounds great to me and if you make it to the point when you can safely play molten rain and keep up removal you should probably be trying to win instead."
ModernMagic,3e0ytb,munyee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:55:24 2015 UTC,"I agree. I am an infect player too and I have to say bolts + snapcasters are my worst enemies (of course there are terminates, path to exiles etc). In my local meta it so UR heavy that I have had to put 4 dispel in my sideboard to protect my creatures (but with that I lost a turn as I always want to have a blue mana against their bolts)."
ModernMagic,3e0ytb,greatersteven,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:37:10 2015 UTC,Are you running wild defiance? It can really take a load off your counter magic/protection spells if you resolve against red decks. Practically essential against UR because of the sheer number of bolts they can bring to the table with snappy.
ModernMagic,3e0ytb,munyee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:38:28 2015 UTC,Yes I do play 2 in the mainboard... but I do not really have more to be honest but yeah it used to save my as if finally resolves :)

ModernMagic,3e0ytb,LovepeaceandStarTrek,4,Tue Jul 21 17:50:36 2015 UTC,"Hello there! I see you have a question about infect. Come visit /r/Infect for tons of qualified answers!  As to your post-  1) I would only bolt it on 2 conditions a) you have a second removal spell and b) you have reason to believe it will mana screw them. It's go>I've been having a bit of difficulty playing against U/G Infect recently, specifically when it comes to the decision making regarding Lightning Bolt and other cheap removal spells against them.  3) Land disruption is decent if you're vulnerable Inkmoth. I have Jund side in Blood Moon and Fulminator mage against me for this reason.  2) As a rule, only use damage or -X/-X removal on your turn. Forcing is to blank a pump spell is a lot like making us discard,  which tends to be good againsy combo. If your opponent lands a Wild Defiance, use other removal on your turn too.  4) Probably. This is a risk/reward scenario of, ""can I close out the game before they draw another infect creature?"" I personally think it's a good idea, but that's probably more scenario based.  Be sure to ask anymore questions you have down at /r/Infect!"
ModernMagic,3e0ytb,Akkatha,3,Tue Jul 21 08:01:32 2015 UTC,"Bolt the infect dudes, play a metric fuckload of spellskites. That's the best card to screw infect over with."
ModernMagic,3e0ytb,landingshortly,2,Tue Jul 21 04:39:36 2015 UTC,"So I guess you play Burn if you specifically refer to Bolt and Molten Rain. I will approach your questions having played Infect for a long time:     I think it depends on your hand. Bolt is pretty much always correct if you have another removal spell. You can also argue bolting the Hierarch if you only have 1 Bolt. Why? Because if you let him live, they can simply protect their 2 mana dude next turn because they have an additional mana. I would not bolt him though because as an infect player what I want is playing it safe (because it has so much removal involved) and not grindy. I will always lose when grinding. Let the 2 mana guy resolve and try to kill it immediately on the end of their turn. When they have the protection, they wasted it and they are down a card. So you got the most out of it.   Damage based removal always after their combat phase or on your turn. You want their pump spells to be voided. Don't play this cute. Playing cute leads to blowouts.   Depends, but I will usually not really fear Molten Rain unless I have a really bad card I need to take out. Blood Moon is good though. The mana base can be pretty greedy.   Yes, sometimes it is necessary to 2-for-1 yourself and that's OK. Because most of their spells are dead when they don't have a creature on board, you simply gain back advantage with card quality or with inevitability. Some times you even need to bait their Vines."
ModernMagic,3e0ytb,spoc351,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:47:07 2015 UTC,"Its usually best to try to interact with them on your turn if you can.  A 2 for 1 on yourself is better than losing, but really the also used a pump spell so really just a 1 for 1.  Molten Rain is narrow, but a can be effective.  On the bolt on noble, that really depends on what is in their hand.  Also never tap out."
ModernMagic,3e0ytb,spoc351,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:07:31 2015 UTC,"Yep, mostly asking for all those games where Spellskite is nowhere to be seen."
ModernMagic,3e0ytb,Krond,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:58:21 2015 UTC,Knowing what deck you are playing would help me help you.
ModernMagic,3e0ytb,DramasticStar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:09:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, killing infect guys on your turn is preferable.  That way they spend a pump spell that could have caused you a lot of poison, or the guy dies.  This goes for non-damage removal as well.  Abrupt Decay, Path, etc. are all better on your turn.  They play Vines of Vastwood and sometimes Mizzium Skin to give their guy hexproof, essentially blanking the kill spell.  Still better to do it on your turn.  Yes, it is worth it to 2 for 1 yourself if it means you will not lose the game.  I'd rather be down a card than down a match."
ModernMagic,3e0ytb,Zephyr256k,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:09:21 2015 UTC,"Creature destruction is very difficult for infect to deal with. I would worry more about getting infect creatures off the field before Nobel Hierarch. If it comes down to them having to deal regular damage to you, it's not as easy to deal regular damage than infect.   Playing spells on your turn to try and kill infect creatures is much better for you. We have to either let it die, or use a spell without a swinging pump.   If possible: invest in spellskite. Two or three for your sideboard can go a long long way in the modern format. It all but shuts Boggle and Infect down."
ModernMagic,3e0ytb,helios5287,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:31:59 2015 UTC,Only if they miss their T2 land drop or don't have an Infect creature by T3. Yes. Only if you're hurting for stuff to replace dead mainboard cards with. That's basically how you beat infect. Make them use all their protection and pump cards in response to your removal instead of using them to just kill you.
ModernMagic,3e0ytb,Cloud-Jumper,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:33:46 2015 UTC,"As an Infect player, I would say that depends on the deck your playing. I honestly would rather have you use your removal on the Heirarch more than an Infect creature but there are alot of games where killing the Heirarch could win the game before it starts. Infect usually functions on very little mana but killing a Heirarch is like killing a land & ""pump"" spell because removing the exalted trigger is often huge for damage math. This is kinda of hit or miss now that Become Immense is a card. Sure they are ""wasting"" the pump to save the creature but your helping to fuel Delve so it would depend on what stage of the game your talking about. Early Game, Definitly. Late Game, you should try and ""make them have it"" on their turn in response to Pumps.  I would say artifact destruction is often better if our worried about Inkmoth. Sure land destruction works but most land destruction spells are slower than artifact destruction. Destructive Revery is better since now you have options if they have a wild Defiance in play (which pretty much shuts down Burn in the first place)  More often it is than it isnt. Infect has a stronger reliance on the small creatures than most creature based decks so you often need to overextend to make sure you can survive due to its speed."
ModernMagic,3dzcd8,chefsati,11,Mon Jul 20 19:28:06 2015 UTC,I'll be the mean guy. You don't have much answers in this deck. It seems you aren't going to be doing much winning until at least turn 4 and you don't have a card that seems to really stop an opponent from winning (combo)
ModernMagic,3dzcd8,Eskimosam,4,Mon Jul 20 21:58:08 2015 UTC,I don't think it's mean at all! I'm definitely looking for constructive criticism. Do you think it's possible to retain the core engine and add cards to make it slightly more resilient (ie. Abrupt Decay and friends)?  I'll level with you - I really don't know a whole lot about modern. I mostly play EDH.
ModernMagic,3dzcd8,MaccaNo1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:05:08 2015 UTC,"It's an interesting take on combo elves. I'd have a look at the combo elves on mtg salvation as it could give you a few ideas.   They are advocating a cloud stone curio approach, but it's a similar idea to what your doing. They maybe the best people to give constructive criticism."
ModernMagic,3dzcd8,Eskimosam,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:24:50 2015 UTC,"Good now that we got the mean part  out of the way my list of constructive critisisms:   Blood Artist - He's got no sac outlet except leap so you are relying on your opponent killing your creatures to get much out of him. As someone who is a HUGE fan of this card... drop him or at least reduce to 1-2.  Removal and combo - I think abrupt decay is your best bet... maybe 2-3 of them? You can take out early vials, and amulets to slow down some opponents but you can really save your own skin in a twin match up. It's the best for you. I think a 1 of murderous cut couldn't hurt too. This deck looks like it wants to be the elves decks running around but you want some black? That 3 drop Elf that was spoiled would be nice... Shaman of the pack! Aside from manamorphose/visonary you aren't can tripping so I recommend saying no to grapeshot? Certainly not 3. as others have said arch druid."
ModernMagic,3dzcd8,PCOBRI,6,Tue Jul 21 12:41:13 2015 UTC,Would highly suggest Elvish Archdruid if you're looking to storm out on Elves..
ModernMagic,3dzcd8,noqxo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:32:30 2015 UTC,"I've got a couple playsets of archdruids kicking around I could try. The 3CMC makes me nervous though. The first draft of this deck also ran Shaman of the Pack, but it was the worst thing to leap into because it killed the leap chain unless I was already at the nettle sentinel / heritage druid stage, at which point I'm already comboing for lethal.  I'll toss a couple in and report back."
ModernMagic,3dzcd8,MTGCardFetcher,4,Mon Jul 20 19:35:25 2015 UTC,[[Dwynen's Elite]] should be in there since it gains you card advantage with leap and pays for itself with heritage druid. additionally it's a solid creature on its own.

ModernMagic,3dzcd8,therift289,2,Mon Jul 20 20:20:55 2015 UTC,"Personally I would play both, alongside Shaman of the Pack as winoption, replacing grapeshot and cutting the manamorphose. You can't find grapeshot/morphose with leap anyway, and drawing it naturally seems pretty unlikely. The Visionary is also good since it pays for itself once you have prowess of the fair out.   the benefit of adding shaman and dwynens elite is that you have a solid beatdown plan as backup."
ModernMagic,3dzcd8,MTGCardFetcher,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:26:55 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I initially added Manamorphose because I often needed to colourfix mid-combo. The Heritage Druids add GGG but if I don't have a Blood Artist out already and I leap into one, it makes it a little awkward. It cantrips which increases my chances of drawing a Grapeshot to close out the game.  I really, really like the Shaman. That was the initial concept behind this deck until I discovered the synergy between Leap and Prowess of the Fair, so I'm not totally opposed to revisiting it."
ModernMagic,3dzcd8,therift289,2,Mon Jul 20 20:48:52 2015 UTC,"You always have the option to keep an GB-land untapped during the combo to be able to cast your finishers, so that wouldn't be an issue most of the time - also gilt-leaf palace is a must here btw.  I find your concept very interesting and would like to hear your opinion once you got a few matches in :)"
ModernMagic,3dzcd8,drewdadruid,2,Mon Jul 20 21:13:38 2015 UTC,"How am I not running Gilt-Leaf Palace? Get in my life!  The other direction I'm exploring right now is cutting red (ie. Grapeshot) entirely and going BUG for Beck // Call. At that point I'd be totally comfortable cutting the Manamorphoses and just splashing blue through the mana base (some combination of UG shocks and Mana Confluences). That way rather than using Grapeshot to end the game, I'd be able to focus more on getting more than one Blood Artist onto the field and draining for 2-4 per leap instead of 1.  Originally we were in red because the combo was enabled through Blasting Station and Impact Tremors / Purphoros, and I think if I were to go with Beck // Call rather than Grapeshot I'd probably head back into the Blasting Station direction as a wincon, even though it's a little clunky at 3 mana.  I'll definitely report back once I have more testing in. It's super janky, but I genuinely feel like there's something here."
ModernMagic,3dzcd8,Quinxs,2,Mon Jul 20 21:20:30 2015 UTC,"I've been brewing this as well, and I absolutely love it. My list plays 1 blood artist, zero grapeshot and zero prowess of the fair. Instead, I play a few more dorks, dwynen's elite, some archdruids, one [[Storm Entity]], and one Emrakul. The idea of the deck is just the same, but all of my wincons get picked up by Evolutionary Leap, unlike Prowess and Grapeshot. A set of chord is in there too, to grab heritage druid or nettle sentinel when I'm ready to go off."

ModernMagic,3dxtuc,bluethedog,7,Mon Jul 20 14:12:29 2015 UTC,"Haha, another roughly 50/50 matchup for Jund!  It's a fair point, I've seen some discussion on the Power Parents being a reasonable option. I'm not convinced it is better than Olivia, and you don't benefit from having any spare artifacts to machine gun people with. The mana investment is very high, but acting like a red Lingering Souls is intriguing, I look forward to seeing what the Jund pilots come up with."
ModernMagic,3dxtuc,Enderkr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:21:43 2015 UTC,Every card you just listed is much better than Mom and Pop in every match up except maybe affinity but I would much rather have a mainboard anger of the gods if I have to mainboard anything in regards to an affinity match up.   Nalaars make no sense and is just a bad card in general.
ModernMagic,3dxtuc,Ryeker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:31:52 2015 UTC,"I'd be inclined to agree it's likely not very good, but I personally just err on the side on playtesting with a card to get an idea for how good it is before dismissing it.  It's pretty rare anymore that fair cards that turn out to be exceptionally good look that way on the surface. Many people might have said the same thing about Siege Rhino or Kolaghan's Command when they came out recently, but playtesting proved otherwise."

Note how he pumps ALL Artifact creatures, and even for free, and the Hangarback pumps only himself and you still need to pay mana. Etched Champion is for finishing games where your opponent managed to stabilize - it's hard to get rid of him. None of this applies to Hangarback."
ModernMagic,3dxtuc,Skanedog,3,Mon Jul 20 15:36:07 2015 UTC,"In a metagame of mostly Twin and Jund, more often than not you're getting your Steel Overseer Bolted or Terminated before you get to activate it. The floor on Hangarback Walker is higher; in this same scenario it's at least a 2 mana Doomed Traveler.  You don't need to tell us that Hangarback Walker isn't the card for you, you've made that fairly obvious, but I can see some more conservative Affinity players want a more value oriented card. Many people play Ensoul Artifact over Steel Overseer for the same reason."
ModernMagic,3dxtuc,chronoflect,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:03:53 2015 UTC,"What I don't like about Hangarback Walker is that the biggest threat to titan IMO is PTE. The exile will prevent the dies trigger, leaving you with nothing."
ModernMagic,3dxtuc,DressedSpring1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:45:10 2015 UTC,"I'm quite sold on Day's Undoing. It'd bad in some matchups (Twin or fast combo in general), but in others it's quite absurd. It's just potentially a dead card, so I'd cast it in bad matchups only if it's the only possibility to have a shot in winning, obliging them to ""have it"". I've been maindecking Stubborn Denial and Spell Pierce though and blue having mana open after Day's is kind of threatening and allows some bluffing. We need a large Modern event to confirm all this though..."
ModernMagic,3dxtuc,kevin-kurly,6,Mon Jul 20 17:02:02 2015 UTC,"I've been trying Days in Affinty but not sure of it yet, don't have any Hangarback Walkers to give them a go.  I've replaced 2x Faithless Looting and 1x Tormenting Voice with Magmatic Insight in my Dredge deck though and that's going really well."
ModernMagic,3dxtuc,4ngryMo,4,Mon Jul 20 13:16:28 2015 UTC,Why would you replace faithless with insight? Isn't faithless a better card for dredge? I would assume that insight is just your faithless looting 5-8.
ModernMagic,3dxtuc,MTGCardFetcher,5,Mon Jul 20 14:52:13 2015 UTC,"Faithless is great but as you have to draw before you discard both Tormenting Voice and Magmatic Insight are a bit better as they make you discard first therefore immediatley enabling dredge if you've got dredgers in your hand and none in the graveyard.   Â   I didn't want to get rid of all of the Faithless looting as on turn 1 they're especially useful to get your hand in order, but later in the game Tormeting Voice and Magmatic Insight are better. Once things get going and I'm starting every turn with a Life from the Loam fueling Raven's Crime / Flame Job the Magmatic Insight is cheaper than Tormenting Voice and means I can make the best use of lands."
ModernMagic,3dxtuc,kevin-kurly,2,Mon Jul 20 15:23:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the explanation. I haven't been able to test out insight in my loam deck yet, but it makes sense that insight/voice are better at enabling dredge if your yard doesn't have any dredge cards yet.   Still, looting is just so good, especially since it has flashback so you don't need to worry if you dredge it. I would feel uneasy cutting more than 1. I guess I'll see for myself once I have a chance to try out insight."
ModernMagic,3dxtuc,4ngryMo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:56:57 2015 UTC,"Faithless is great but as you have to draw before you discard both Tormenting Voice and Magmatic Insight are a bit better as they make you discard first therefore immediatley enabling dredge if you've got dredgers in your hand and none in the graveyard.    Eh, it's ""a little bit of column a, a little bit of column b"" IMO. Discarding first is certainly better if you're dredging on that draw, but if you're actually drawing to look for a zombie or something you need to cast from hand then being able to pitch back the Vengevine you draw off a faithless is a lot better than discarding before knowing what you're going to draw."

This list is not yet extensively play-tested, I just ran a couple of games against a B/W Spirit Token deck, which it performed amazing against. [[Shaman of the Pack]] was ideal to soften the ground for [[Ezuri, Renegade Leader]] and getting the correct mana colours was never an issue. I don't think there is a way to get rid of Ezuri just yet, we still need him as a win-condition, but we can broaden the scope, which is why I have 4 Shamans in there. Also, [[Rhys the Exiled]] turned out to be amazing since you can ram him each round and get a bazillion life, if necessary.

ModernMagic,3dxtuc,splintertim,3,Mon Jul 20 17:43:29 2015 UTC,"Full disclaimer: Before I am thoroughly chastised, I just got into Modern and I don't really know the meta much.   Is it possible to create a burn deck using the Urza lands and [Pyromancer's Goggles] to make Fireballs and other spells like this do massive amounts of damage?   Or is this just wishful thinking?"
ModernMagic,3dxtuc,volrathxp,4,Mon Jul 20 19:18:40 2015 UTC,"It's tough to cast 5 mana spells in Modern that require other spells to be good. If you look at other cards Tron tries to cast with their mana, you'll notice they're all individually powerful cards on their own, like Wurmcoil Engine, Ugin, Karn, and Oblivion Stone.  Here's a good cheat sheet you can use if you want to see if a card over 2 mana is good in Modern. It needs to:   Be capable of winning you the game on it's own. This can be through generating card advantage, an ""army in a can"" ability, or a card that clocks and is difficult to remove. Combo with other cards in your deck to win you the game or interact with the opponent or board state in some way to prevent you from losing. A way to protect itself from removal (even four toughness works here). Be an instant or a creature with flash. This allows you to hold up other interactive spells but not waste your mana when they pass without doing anything.   Granted, you can argue this qualifies under the second bullet, but you need Banefire and this card when you could just be casting Emrakul likely at that point."
ModernMagic,3dxtuc,jamoncito,2,Mon Jul 20 19:29:59 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the explanation.   I never really heard it this way.   The only modern deck I have right now is a Blistercoil Weird/Paradise Mantle combo/storm deck.   It's fun, but it's so fragile, but it was so cheap that I didn't care.   I'm looking to build something not so expensive, but still competitive.   I'm looking at either burn or hand control."

ModernMagic,3dxtuc,treystand,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:02:35 2015 UTC,"Is there much of a reason to want Languish over Anger of the Gods? 3 damage is killing everything you care about outside of Wilted Abzan with the same effect on your creatures.  A mana less is worth the more restricted cost in my eyes, especially when you need that sweeper effect against fast decks like Elves and Merfolk."
ModernMagic,3dxtuc,jamoncito,2,Mon Jul 20 15:50:41 2015 UTC,"It doesn't seem like much, but in testing and practice that extra one damage has been huge - it hits things like Spellskite (probably the most important thing), Smiters, Thrun, Merfolk with a higher amount of lords on board, etc. Also, CoCo decks can get 4 toughness creatures on board with the help of Gavony, and this helps combat that a little more as well.

I'm still on the fence about Shaman though. Against decks like tokens, pulling one off a CoCo when you can't find Eruzi can end the game or put you close enough to squeeze just enough damage through to end it.

It has a lot of maindeck grave hate but limited disruption. The +1/+1 counter synergy is great and you can even play groundbreaker if you're feeling saucy. You also laugh at blood moons but can fold to an anger of the gods or ghostly prison. I got a big high five from mopping the floor with jund and kikichord using stompy last FNM.
ModernMagic,3dzh06,jshwrd89,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:37:32 2015 UTC,"It's not so much the case anymore (freaking price jumps), but you can still probably build Merfolk for $300 or so.

It still bothers me."
ModernMagic,3dxf5f,Teeniesaurus,10,Mon Jul 20 09:32:54 2015 UTC,"RUG Twin is my favorite deck in modern, and if you build it it'll be yours too. Here's why:  The deck has two game plans that don't interfere with each other and often help each other out. Plan A is the beatdown control deck, and plan B is the Twin Combo, It took me a while to realize that but after playing the deck for a while it became much more clear. So with plan A you want to get a goyf out and control the board with bolts and counterspells until you get them to 0, plan B is to assemble twin combo. They help each other out by drawing out removal with the beatdown role helping your twin plan, and your twin plan distracting the opponent and not using their mana properly until you tempo them out of the game. This seamless integration of two playstyles makes RUG Twin one of my favorite decks of all time because of how well it works. It works better than RUG moon because it has a better backup plan and it works better than Scapeshift because lands already have a target on their heads from Amulet and being able to beat down while threatening to twin is better than trying to control and ramp.  If you do decide to build RUG Twin one player that you can learn from is Patrick Dickmann, he innovated the deck and he has tons of feature matches that you can watch and a few articles on the deck too, including this one that is super great at explaining why its the best twin variant."
ModernMagic,3dxf5f,VinylBreadPuddin,5,Mon Jul 20 11:16:38 2015 UTC,RUG twin has the best mix between combo and beatdown of the three. You can win some games that you would not be able to win with RUG moon (boggles for example).   Also I wouldn't want to play scapeshift when people maindeck fulminator mages.
ModernMagic,3dxf5f,noqxo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:48:26 2015 UTC,I just don't want to hate it after being on delver so long.

ModernMagic,3dxf5f,AcademyRuins,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:16:35 2015 UTC,"Maindeck Fulminator is not at all common, it's a pretty metagame dependent decision. Scapeshift is not a bad choice presently when midrange and durdley Grixis decks are the flavor of the month, but it's not exactly a great choice either when there's a decent amount of linear aggro decks like Burn and Affinity running around too."

ModernMagic,3dxf5f,noqxo,2,Mon Jul 20 12:49:41 2015 UTC,"Unless you draw lots of bolts/snapcasters merfolk is a challenging matchup for both RUG Twin and Moon.  As for Scapeshift it highly depends on your build. If you opt to play lightning bolts (which is currently the standard i guess) and draw a few cryptics it's actually not that bad, especially since their spreading seas does not disrupt your combo. You have to be aware of ghost quarter/tec edge though."
ModernMagic,3dxf5f,RedeNElla,3,Mon Jul 20 13:14:34 2015 UTC,"My main issue (as scapeshift, with bolts) was that vials let them drop a clock while keeping up countermagic for the cryptic. Getting a life-saving cryptic spell pierced is brutal."
ModernMagic,3dxf5f,noqxo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:11:25 2015 UTC,Yeah that sounds brutal. Thankfully the merfolk builds defer a lot regarding the amount of counterspells.
ModernMagic,3dxf5f,AcademyRuins,4,Tue Jul 21 12:15:30 2015 UTC,"RUG Twin is the most streamlined and aggressive of all the Twin variants. UR Twin has no two drops and no beefy threats to close out the game. Grixis Twin's mana is some of the most taxing in the format (I need to hit U on T1, RB on T2, 1UUU or 2RR on T4, all while supporting Blood Moon in the sideboard?) and most of its spells are clumped at the top end.  RUG is the only variant that is actually a natural tempo deck. You play a turn two, unboltable Goyf and they're stuck dealing with the threat of being beaten down, getting combo'd out, or having all their spells Remand, Snap Remanded for the rest of the game."

ModernMagic,3dyuyh,rumballtron,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:53:10 2015 UTC,"Based on the board you have, you want the Finks and the Bow for burn for lifegain; the Beast Withins and Hushwing Gryff for Bloom because they don't do much if you can kill their titans and stopping the titan etb slows them down a ton and otherwise you have actual zero interaction; grindy value stuff for jun(d/k) like the witnesses and the bow, because buying back CoCo is great against a 1 for 1 deck and letting your weenies attack through their goyfs and things is value; and rec sage, dismember, and beast withins for Merfolk, to kill aether vials and lords.  To take out, you wanna start with things like rec sage/spellskite/scooze in matchups where they aren't good or needed, and then if you absolutely have to board out other things I usually start with visionarys, because it impacts the explosiveness of the deck the least. Unless it's a grindy matchup like jun(d/k), then visionary is great and something like probably heritage druid would be your second round cut."

Something like a 3x5 card that says ""Affinity: -3 this +3 that, Jund: -2 x -1y +3 z""  So once you've got some good ideas, go ahead and write em down and take them with you."

Maybe drop a Memnite or two for Welding Jar. I would also suggest maybe two lands like Ghost Quarter or similar sideboard or main depending on meta, for land removal to deal with decks like Tron for example."

ModernMagic,3dynmz,IAmGnarles,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:08:21 2015 UTC,"This doesn't seem too bad, honestly.  You missed the boat on Ravagers. Since you aren't willing to shell out $25/per for Inkmoth Nexus, I am going to assume the $40 Ravager is out of the question too.  Since you said you want it to be faster, I would suggest the following:   -2 Whipflare -2 Etched Champion -2 Adarkar Wastes +4 Galvanic Blast +2 Shivan Reef (or another UR Land) +1 Mountain (this could be a UR land as well) +1 Shrapnel Blast   The Tempered Steel version of Affinity isn't supposed to be lightning Quick: It builds smaller guys into bigger ones to over-power the opponent. sure, it can be fast, but that isn't it's main focus. If you want speed, run more burn."
ModernMagic,3dynmz,braindeadwolf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:46:49 2015 UTC,"He dude thanks for the help! The ravagers are actually only 8 bucks online so I would be willing to nab those.  And I probably could have clarified my statements more. It's not that the deck isn't fast enough per se it's that I found myself either not able to cast Tempered Steel, either because I lost or my board got fucked by my opponent.  I think just moving the deck towards a more burn aspect is probably better for my playstyle thank you for the advice!"
ModernMagic,3dynmz,braindeadwolf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:19:41 2015 UTC,"Have you tested Ensoul Artifact? It's another threat that can come down very quickly, and sometimes is just too much for some decks to handle. You can sort of think of it as cranial 5+ as it can boost whatever you need. Some people worry about getting two for oned with it, but when you ensoul your third springleaf drum it really doesnt feel like that. But as Spam said, ravagers are first priority. I would personally rather take out a frogmite or two for welding jar instead, as memnite just is a little more gas in my opinion."
ModernMagic,3dynmz,braindeadwolf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:56:23 2015 UTC,I did and in all honesty can't figure out why I cut them.  -2 frogmite for 2x ravager is the trade ill be making as soon as a I get one.  Do you have any advice for what to cut for Ensoul?
ModernMagic,3dwc0p,andrewweiser,8,Mon Jul 20 02:01:31 2015 UTC,"4 Cryptic and 1 ojutai's command seems like a lot of 4 cmc spells, and 3 remands is quite a bit for a deck that is using them to delay and not just win.  I would consider playing no more than 1 remand, cutting the ojutai's command, maybe consider something like valorous stance or possibly swift reconning for an additional removal spell, and the third mana leak.  I think there is a lot of upside to Ojutai and playing a second would be good as well.  As for the lands, I think ghost quarter is too good right now and I would prefer that over tectonic edge.  Tron and amulet do not care about having 4 lands in play, which is where the mana denial is most necessary.  The major difference is you are using ghost quarter on specific lands in other matchups and not to deny colors.  Save it for gavony and lighthouse.  It is also fine since you are already playing path, most 3 color decks cap out at 4 basics.  As for the sideboard Keranos is one of the best cards you can have in RU and you don't seem to have one in here.  I think that is a major oversight.  I am not sure the leylines or firewalkers are necessary as you have the tools to fight against burn (you can race, gain life, counter) as well as discard.  I'd rather see some additional counters to sure up the twin or other blue matchups.  My preference would be 2 negate and 1 dispel (in addition to the maindeck dispel) which opens up 2 more slots - one for keranos.  For the last slot I'd prefer pyroclasm, and possibly moving the anger of the gods into the 2nd pyroclasm as well unless you feel kitchen finks and vocie are too prevalent for you, then if you can avoid infect and affinity, maybe 2 angers instead.  One last point I'd like to make is rest in peace and relic.  I think you have to decide what matchups you want those for and play 2 of the same.  If you are going to be ok with boarding out snapcasters and into rest in peace for those matchups, then play that.  If you still want to keep snapcasters in for those matchups, then play 2 relic.  I don't like the split as it makes those matchups more difficult to sideboard and gives you less resiliency.  I think rest in peace is so much more powerful, that is the effect you'd rather go with.  Overall  -1 Ojutai's Command  -2 Remand  +1 Mana Leak  +1 Dragonlord Ojutai  +1 Valorous Stance  Sideboard  -3 Leyline of Sanctity  -2 Kor Firewalker  -1 Relic of Progenitus  +1 Rest in Peace  +1 Pyroclasm (or 2 if you cut Anger of the Gods)  +2 Negate  +1 Dispel  +1 Keranos, God of Storms"
ModernMagic,3dwc0p,davebu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:37:24 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for the feedback davebu!   Yeah, i've been trying out ojutai's command, but aren't attached to it as it does add another 4CMC spell. (Though the value when getting back a Snapcaster and counter creature is great.)  Ghost quarters are definitely in consideration and I agree on all accounts. I'll try swapping out the tec edges for quarters.   Keranos is a card i've been trying to fit in. Would you consider it maindeckable?"
ModernMagic,3dwc0p,Rathalor,3,Mon Jul 20 03:48:46 2015 UTC,"I have been on UWR Control for the past 2 years and since the printing of Keranos I have always found room for him in the main. 80% of games I have resolved a Keranos, especially game 1, I have ended up winning. UWR is a deck that wants to trade 1-1's at worst and eek out advantage over time and both Sphinx's Rev and Keranos are amazing at stabilizing and keeping control after the initial struggle."
ModernMagic,3dwc0p,why_fist_puppies,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:56:05 2015 UTC,Thats great to hear. I'll definitely make space for him in the main!
ModernMagic,3dwc0p,why_fist_puppies,2,Mon Jul 20 04:02:34 2015 UTC,"I am going to present a contrasting opinion.   I personally love Keranos to the point that it is probably my favorite card in the format. That said, I don't know how much you want him maindeck right now. While he is very good in fair, grindy matchups (Grixis Control/Delver, BGx, Twin post board probably) and okay against creature based aggro decks, he is a very clunky card against the unfair decks that are extremely popular right now.   Against decks like infect, tron, amulet, twin game one, Living End, Collected Company, Goryo's Vengeance, burn, etc: he is often going to have to sit in your hand until turn 8+ oftentimes as tapping out means you just die. Having Ojutai in the deck also risks some very clunky hands.   I think it is a meta call, but he's probably a sideboard card right now. Also, so I don't have to make an other comment: I think the Ojutai's command may also be clunky right noe in addition to the four cryptics."
ModernMagic,3dwc0p,davebu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:51:49 2015 UTC,"hey why_fists_puppies, thanks for the counter point. Yeah, i think maybe that was why i hadn't added him already since I've typically only played on MTGO where the meta seems to skew toward faster decks IMO. I'll definitely try Keranos out, as almost everyone has suggested that's a piece i'm missing, and then make the meta call on if he's main vs. sideboard.   Agreed. I was just trying out Ojutai's command, will be cutting it for another wrath most likely. Thoughts on 2 wraths in the main?"
ModernMagic,3dwc0p,EDaniels21,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:19:34 2015 UTC,"Two wipes is fine. I've alternated between one and two depending on how many creature decks I'm expecting. An additional piece of cheap counter magic might be another option, though. Mana leak or a second snare would both be fine."
ModernMagic,3dwc0p,M4GICM1KE,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:10:16 2015 UTC,"It really depends on what your meta is composed of.  If you are playing against grixis control, jund, junk, or other midrange decks then yes it is.  If you are up against tron, amulet, infect, affinity, twin (before board), burn, grishoalbrand, or other decks along those lines it is your worst draw.  For an open field it definitely has to be in the board though."
ModernMagic,3dwc0p,Rathalor,3,Mon Jul 20 04:11:49 2015 UTC,"I've been on UWR for over a year now and I love it! It's a deck that really demands tight play and isn't exactly perfectly positioned right now but can hold its own against nearly all of the field.  For maindeck I'd consider cutting some remands for other better counters. This deck goes long and doesn't typically kill quick enough that it's worth remanding. I do like 1 or 2, but typically prefer mana leak. Also, Spell Snare is amazing! Against BGx it hits goyf, bob, scavenging ooze, etc. Which takes a lot of pressure off path to exile. Against blue decks it hits remand, leak, and importantly Snapcaster. I usually run 3 Snares, never fewer than 2.  Slayer's stronghold seems like a weird land choice, too. This deck wins through burn and Colonnade more often than attacking with dudes. I prefer extra fixing or a the UR loothouse. Same goes for Minamo. I'd rather have extra fetches. I think flooded strand is typically better than mesa btw as it's better against blood moon and island > mtn or plains but I guess I could see it being decent. This deck can struggle against the ""land"" decks of the format (amulet bloom and tron) which makes tec edge worse than ghost quarter right now, but if they lose popularity I think tec edge is generally better. Either way, I think 3 is probably more optimal, despite potentially being a problem.  Counterflux, Dispel, and Logic Knot are interesting additions mb. I find the 1st 2 are often great sb but Idk if I'd maindeck either. Ojutai's Command seems like 1 4 drop too many if it's not going to be a threat. I've ran a couple restoration angels at times and had decent success with that as another consideration. It pairs with snapcaster and is a reasonable flash body that can attack life totals fairly quickly. Seldom amazing but almost always decent at worst.  I haven't tried out the dragonlord yet but he seems decent. I've really had great luck with Gideon Jura, though. Ajani Vengeant can be pretty good, too.  Finally, I really like engineered explosives from the sideboard and spellskite is often wonderful. The meta is fairly wide so tune it to your needs, but I'm not sure if leyline is necessary personally. Same for the firewalkers as burn isn't actually too bad of a matchup. Anyway, just some thoughts. Good luck to you! Don't give up if things don't go great immediately. It takes a fair amount of practice like any good control deck should."
ModernMagic,3dwc0p,TheUndercutter,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:18:05 2015 UTC,I like it...i wonder if another supreme or two in the main but you'll have to feel that out.  Its hard to argue its better then playing black just for the delve threats but it looks really nice!  2 tec edge might be risky
ModernMagic,3dwc0p,The_G_in_OMG,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:17:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Yeah, i've toyed around with more wraths in the main, definitely think that it's something to move toward.

ModernMagic,3dwc0p,BennyKB,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:30:03 2015 UTC,"As stated before, I've been on the UWR train for some time. My list is more or less tuned to beat my meta, as UWR should be, so take it with a grain of salt.  Creatures   1 Grim Lavamancer 4 Snapcaster Mage 2 Vendillion Clique 1 Keranos, God of Storms   Instants   1 Dispel 4 Lightning Bolt 3 Path to Exile 3 Mana Leak 3 Lightning Helix 2 Izzet Charm 3 Electrolyze 3 Cryptic Command 2 Sphinx's Revelation   Sorceries   1 Wrath of God 1 Supreme Verdict   Planeswalker   1 Ajani Vengeant   Land   4 Island 2 Plains 1 Mountain 3 Celestial Colonnade 2 Hallowed Fountain 2 Steam Vents 1 Sacred Foundry 4 Flooded Strand 2 Polluted Delta 1 Arid Mesa 2 Sulfur Falls 1 Ghost Quarter 1 Desolate Lighthouse   Sideboard   1 Grim Lavamancer 1 Rest in Peace 2 Pyroclasm 1 Anger of the Gods 1 Celestial Purge 1 Batterskull 1 Teferi, Mage of Zhalfir 2 Timely Reinforcements 2 Spellskite 2 Wear//Tear 1 Engineered Explosives   Alright, so that's my list. Comparing it to yours the core seems similar but there are differences in a number of areas. I'll go over the cards in your list I am not playing and why and what I ended up playing over them (because I can promise you I have played nearly every variant of this deck).  1 Is Dragonlord Ojutai. I liked the look of Ojutai when he was spoiled but I have been reasonably unimpressed with him in paper. The more I cast Ojutai in testing the more I was reminded of Thundermaw Hellkite when I was on UWR Flash and I just wished I was casting the Hellkite instead. I don't like tapping out with the exlusion of Keranos and that's mainly because I know he's an investment that will just keep on giving until the game is over. It's very rare he's able to be removed. Ojutai is like Thundermaw in that capacity. They both die to the same removal and Ojutai has the added disadvantage of being chumped by Spirit tokens AND not swinging when it comes down. Sure, he's hexproof until you turn him sideways and I suppose that's nice but it was never super relevant. Thundermaw kills 1 turn earlier and I don't think getting a free Anticipate if Ojutai connects is amazing. That said, he IS playable in the shell, just lacklustre in my experience.  2 Is good old Counterflux. Is storm big in your meta? Keep it in. Is control big in your meta? Put it in the board. Not much else to say about this one. It's an uncounterable cancel with weird mana requirements. Usually 1-1's which is ok and will only ever get more than that against Storm. It's surprisingly hard to 'gotcha' a control opponent with this because you usually end up countering their counterspells which makes your other counterspells fizzle. Weird.  3 is Logic Knot. I see what you're doing and it makes sense. Card is fine. I just never liked casting it. In your opening hand it is pretty bad, in the midgame it is probably a worse mana leak and in the lategame you'll usually probably maybe just hard counter a spell. I replaced this with Grim Lavamancer quicksmart. Having a free shock nearly every turn and forcing your opponent to kill a 1 mana 1/1 was always a better deal in my opinion. Even better when they can't kill it immediately and you just mow the board down.  4 is Remand. Fuck that card. I know some people play it to certain levels of success in UWR but I have always felt like it is a trap. Twin can justify it because it can kill on turn 4, Scapeshift gets to play it because it can kill on 5. You don't usually kill until turn 8+, depending on the matchup and this is not really a 1-1. They cast a threat, you remand it. Best case is you draw an actual counterspell like mana leak for it next turn. Worst and most likely case is you draw a land and then they play their threat anyway. It's also the most fun thing in the universe to just put a cranial plating back into an affinity players hand and watch them cast it again on turn 2 anyway. I have straight up remove this card for UWR control and only relegate it to the UWR Flash variants with Geist of St Traft. I would strongly recommend Izzet Charm over Remand.  5 is Ojutais command. Card is fine but I feel like you probably should be on a second wrath. Supreme Verdict makes or breaks some matchups, so either a second one of those or a Wrath of God will improve your creature matchups far more than this ever will. Wrathing the board will usually net you more than 4 life + 1 card.  6 is the last one on my list. Slayers Stronghold? Wat. You already have lategame with Colonnade. I suppose making your 8 dudes bigger might possibly be worth the mana if you're in a topdeck situation but I think sculpting a hand at that stage with a Desolate Lighthouse will always be more favoured. Seeing more cards than your opponent is pretty gas.  As for your sideboard, everything there looks like a pretty solid choice. That's not something anyone here can nail down for you. Just take it to an event with a notepad, write down all the cards that have been problematic for you and then work out how to beat them. That is the true beauty of this deck, there's no single pile of 75 cards that is 'true' UWR control.  Like I stated in the preface, my list is suited to my meta but I have played every single card in your deck. Get on out there and do some testing, tune your list and enjoy the modern format. Keep the UWR Control Dream alive!"
ModernMagic,3dwc0p,splintertim,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:46:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks Rathalor, appreciate the card by card feedback.  I've only recently moved to Ojutai, and am still figuring out it he's worth it. The hexproof is great, but I also don't like tapping out for him, maybe more testing will ultimately lead to him being removed.   I run the maindeck counterflux to hedge against combo decks, (as well as you mentioned: storm). Also, maybe I'm bias, but I just really like the card :)  Yeah, logic knot is mainly in there under the pretense of that I figured having a single delve spell was strong in the deck, seeing as more often than not I've found it to be a hard counter. But I'm not opposed to cutting it for lavamancer. How has the snapcaster/lavamancer interactions played out for you in a control shell?  Yeah, overall I'm hearing ""cut down on remand"". Done and done! I'm planning on cutting down to 1, maybe 2, main.  Ojutais command is a card I'm playing around with, I was initially playing 3 cryptics and 1 ojutais commands, but maybe should just stick to 4 cryptics.   Ahh, slayer's stronghold, (as well as Minamo) are there for Ojutai. Being able to give him haste/vigilance is huge, because he retains hexproof. Maybe it's too cute, but I wanted some ways to protect him without using counter. He's actually been fairly effective in just closing out a game, but want to try a Keranos in his place.  Thanks!!"
ModernMagic,3dwc0p,splintertim,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:19:48 2015 UTC,"You made a great choice for your first modern deck. I personally love UWR because it can grind it out w manlands and sweepers, combo out w Kiki, or tempo with Geist for example. My advice is more Remand to advance your hand if you're looking to combo, or more Mana Leaks for the other strategies. I always like some Remands because I rely on them to keep me drawing lands, and Snapping them is always awesome."
ModernMagic,3dvx73,andrewriker,3,Sun Jul 19 23:48:40 2015 UTC,"I play a MW Stax list for about the past 11 months  I used to run a heavy chalice/trinisphere build with storage matrix when Pod was legal before Khans came out. There was also a mix of soul sisters in the deck with Martyr of Sands and a Felidar Sovereign as a win condition but it felt cheesy and slow. After that I changed it up and put in Arbiters + Paths which I feel was a necessary choice. There wasn't much interaction early which meant just turn 3 and 4 spells, and Arbiter can easily slow down a greedy manabase. Chalice was great when delver was being played a lot in the treasure cruise era but right now it is mostly limited to a few battles like Burn, Bogles, and Infect.   Most other lists you see running land stax in modern also do not have mutavaults in their 75 at all. This is somewhat of my brew for a few reasons. It allows me to cast my wraths and have a creature to attack on the back mode. It gives me protection against apostle's blessing effects. Lord of Atlantis gives it islandwalk and +1/+1 (sometimes relevant sometimes not). Basically it gives me an alternate win condition. There have been times where I had the game state locked out to the point I was able to animate a mutavault and equip a batterskull to it then give it flying with Elspeth. You don't quite know what the feeling of that is until you experience it but man it is freaking awesome.  Speaking of land base in the deck, I do not run tectonic edges because of the mutavaults. There's only a few matchups the tec edges were really doing work for me and other times they were ruining my curve. Crucible with Leonin Arbiter + Magus is usually a good enough lock to reoccur Ghost Quarters. Did I mention how good Arbiter is yet?  Other than that, the other pieces are there for obvious reasons. Ghostly Prison shuts down mass strats, O-ring/B-light are there for troublesome random permanents and jank, Nevermore and Runed Halo name cards that are bad for you in matchups. Wrath cause Wrath.   My latest build I wanted to try out an Archangel in the main as a singleton which I outlined in my description. It has some potential to speed the kill up at times and due to the flying allows me to hit planeswalkers if needed. The 5 toughness is like the 6 toughness on Magus (really annoying for your opponent).   Overall, I really love this deck a lot. It is just fun to see my opponent cringe over not being able to cast spells and be locked out of the match and die a slow painful death. At competitive REL, it sometimes puts them on tilt to the point that they make mistakes, which is the exact competitive edge I look for in a deck. Maybe I'm a sick individual but at least I have my board state intact ;)."
ModernMagic,3dvx73,lashazior,2,Mon Jul 20 08:53:42 2015 UTC,"How has Magus been with 10 maindeck creatures? I've been tempted to bring my own creature count up, but do you find that it constrains you in any way?"
ModernMagic,3dvx73,AriiMoose,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:29:53 2015 UTC,"It has not been as bad as it seems in theory. The main point of Magus is more of a mana tax on the opponent and slowing them down enough that they can't pay to attack through prison so I can fly over with elspeth or batterskull beats. Arbiter is similar in that I only need it to slow the game down enough to get a good lock going. I'll regularly have a double Magus presence on the field just to tax my opponent long enough for them to decide to sacrifice a creature. The times I am casting World Queller or Archangel is more to get ahead or establish a true lock (Flagstones + Queller + Crucible, Archangel + a few prisons + batterskull). Once they serve their purpose I am ahead enough to be able to attack with a batterskull or something similar. Also remember this deck runs 4 mutavaults so there's some hidden creature power, which I got the idea from last standard rotation that had UW supreme verdict decks that did similar work. With crucible, you can just get mutavaults back if needed, and Ajani Goldmane can put permanent counters on mutavaults when needed or Elspeth can turn them into 5/5 flyers."

ModernMagic,3dvx73,lashazior,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:46:44 2015 UTC,"Very interested. Thanks for the tips and feedback. How do you think this deck is compared to something more D+T, like Mono White, White Green, or White/Red prison?    I feel like a lot of the decks that run Magus are just so janky and require some weird cards to make work."
ModernMagic,3dvx73,lashazior,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:10:09 2015 UTC,"D&T can win way faster than this deck and doesn't have as much issues against creature decks but lacks the hard lock that mine does. W/G has the benefits of running Choke and Knight of the Reliquary as a win condition along with Canopy for card draw. RW gets the benefit of boom/bust as another land destruction spell which is great against tron, as well as helix/bolt for creatures and Ajani Vengeant. Mono White is the most budget friendly deck and the mana base allows you to do weird things with lands (such as my mutavaults). My deck sucks against Tron if Arbiter can't land on turn 2 to stop expedition map searching and it is also dependent on decks that allow me to abuse nevermore/runed halo for crazy results. The meta right now would lean me to believe RW is the best just for the consistency in getting rid of Bobs and other creatures (Rending Volley was a nice addition).

ModernMagic,3dvx73,AriiMoose,3,Mon Jul 20 14:35:16 2015 UTC,"I've been playing R/W Landkill Stax. I've been using one of the stock lists from this primer: http://www.mtgsalvation.com/forums/the-game/modern/deck-creation-modern/556716-r-w-lockdown-boros-bridge-rw-stax-landkill-and  It's an absolute blast if you like prison decks, but you have to go light on the creatures due to Magus of the Tabernacle. The deck can be a bit slow because you don't play your best spells until T3/T4, but with Boom//Bust and Stone Rain you can get there easily enough.   At the moment I'm not a huge fan of Chalice. A lot of the time while it locks my opponent off of some of their valuable spells, like Remand, Mana Leak etc, it tends to cut me off some of my own spells that are crucial. The most effective way I've been able to use it is setting it to 0 against Affinity on the play."
ModernMagic,3dvx73,cyyfyy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:05:26 2015 UTC,"Hm, yeah I am trying to see if Chalice is worth it maindeck in Modern. I mean, Path,Bolt,Thoughtseize/Duress/Vapor Snag/Boggles/Burn/Serum Visions/Dispel/Thoughtscour/Noble....the list has something for everyone but I just feel like with Red and White it's criminal to not play Path and Bolt?"
ModernMagic,3dvx73,ultilink,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:08:54 2015 UTC,"I avoid Path, mainly because it helps your opponent get out from your lock. If I'm casting Stone Rain and Boom//Bust I don't want to give my opponent land. Most of the time Magus of the Tabernacle will result in the creatures being removed, or Ghostly Prison negates the need to remove them.   Instead I run Lightning Helix so that I have more removal without giving them an advantage. Lately I've been considering testing out Valorous Stance to help protect Magus and remove creatures out of Bolt range."
ModernMagic,3dvx73,ultilink,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:26:25 2015 UTC,"Hm...wow yeah Stax goes off the deep end with card selection. I was thinking of something a little more nuanced, and maybe not including things like Magus or Queller, but more along the lines of Blood Moon, Chalice, Thalia, Wingmare, RIP, Boil, Mindcensor, etc. I keep getting torn between a prison and hatebears-esque.

My only concern is that having too many Thalia/Wingmare effects might hinder your ability to play your equipments. But that will be seen in playtesting. Please let us know how your testing goes!
ModernMagic,3dvggu,the_chandler,2,Sun Jul 19 22:49:33 2015 UTC,"In a world with Kolaghan's Command, I'd probably best take them out,  But they are there to help me punch through.  In my initial testing it wasn't uncommon (when it was in my opening hand) to play aether vial turn 1.  Then play the equipment turn 2 and vial in Isamaru / Kytheon.   But it plays a similar role as Anafenza in that it just makes my guys a little better."

ModernMagic,3dvggu,MadBadMikeomak,2,Mon Jul 20 05:35:32 2015 UTC,"Been playing Death and Taxes for a while now. Heres my recommendations.  = -3 Isamaru,- 1 Kytheon, +4 Dryad Militant: Dryad Militant actually hoses a lot right now, swings for the same amount, and doesn't clog up your hand being legendary.  = -2 Mirran Crusader, +2 Kitchen finks: Crusader is good against the GBx Decks, but is actually just terrible against the bolt deck. Bolt is one of the most played cards and is still good against the GBx Decks.  =-2 hero's Blade, -1 Konda's banner +3 flickerwisp: anti-synergies with thalia, vryn wingmare. There will cost more than 2 a lot of the time. The other bad thing about equipment is it's slow. You take 2 mana to cast it, then take the hit to equip it. If your casting an equipment instead of a creature your slowing down pressure. The deck needs pressure. Flickerwisp is actually just insane if you have a vial on 3. Very close, if not already, one of the best cards to play with vial. It does so many things. I could right a list, or you could play it and see for yourself.  =-2 anafenza, +2 spellskite: Anafenza has a love/hate relationship with this deck I feel. This is the deck that wants it. Turning your x/1s to x/2 is pretty good. The problem is that it's just worse than Thalia and Leonin arbiter, so you generally should be playing them first. The problem is then you are missing out on bolster triggers because your playing creatures before her. I think shes fine as a one-of, but other than that shes a bad topdeck, doesn't affect the board immediatly, and is generally only good on turn 2 which you want to be casting other cards. Spellskite is good here because your deck is weak to bolt, and it protects your hate bears from removal when your ahead to keep you ahead. (and with this deck you NEED to be ahead)."

ModernMagic,3dvggu,MrJimBeam,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:50:50 2015 UTC,"It's probably faster than traditional builds with all the low cost creatures, but I feel like you're missing a lot of utility without having access to Flickerwisp tricks. I guess if your goal is to race, then you probably don't care about them but I've won many matches with them by removing a key threat or saving one of mine during the last turns of a game. A 3 power flyer can be pretty great too in terms of just wanting a beat down.  Also, while your CMC for creatures is never over 3, you also have a lot of creatures that aren't 3. Most builds aim to keep the majority of creatures at 3CMC to maximize the value of vials. A lot of opponents I've played also told me that the vial kept them on tilt because they never knew was going to come out of it when I tapped it after it hit 3. If your goal is ramp out creatures quickly, you're going to be relying a lot on having a the right combination in your opening hand to get 2 out every turn. I switched to Elves after DTK, so I don't know how much Kolaghan's Command has affected the deck's core strategy of getting our early and keeping a Vial at 3."
ModernMagic,3dvggu,Surtysurt,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:31:02 2015 UTC,"While Kolaghan's Command is definately a beating.  By the time it comes online, I've emptied my hand and I'm in top deck mode.  Killing the vial felt meh as far as the kill vial / kill a creature option.  Kill vial / discard generally ended up me putting the drawn creature into play in response.  And top top all of it off.. with all the Thalia effects, Kolaghan's Command was usually 4 and clunky.  As far as Flickerwisp tricks, the removing a blocker / saving a creature with a vial always felt sub par.  Yes it gets value when you pull a trick with it, but by itself it's not all that scare.  The flying is important though and I may drop the Mirran Crusaders for them and probably drop the equipment if I went down that route."
ModernMagic,3dvggu,shinigami564,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:36:02 2015 UTC,"Can we have a bit more info on your worst match ups? If you're having trouble getting the last couple points in I would recommend an alternative route. Drop some equipment and add in [Eight-and-a-Half-Tails] or [Spirit en-Dal], both let you sneak past blockers, and make it even harder to interact with your creatures! Or you could go the [Brave the Elements] route.  edit: there's also no reason not to have 4 Flagstones of Trokair, with Ghost Quarters you are thinning two lands at a time, and not losing any life, or having to deal with etb tapped lands. Hopefully that will not have you flooding as often."
ModernMagic,3dvggu,CptFizz,2,Mon Jul 20 05:53:50 2015 UTC,"My worse matchups ( out of Jund, Burn, Affinity, Grixis Twin, Grixis Control) seem to be Jund, Grixis Twin, Grixis Control.  These matchups I depend a ton on the disruption of Leonin Arbiter/Thalia and putting as much pressure on their life total that I can.  Burn seemed to be about 50/50.  Someone else pointed out about Inquisitor Exarch.  That is definitely pushing me back to drop the crusaders and tweak the main board around to include the flickers and them.  That'll help get me some more reach and help push my burn match up just a little bit more.    I'm unsure about the Flagstone of Trokair.  They can create awkward positions with my own Leonin Arbiters to thin a land.  Unless I'm missing something completely."

ModernMagic,3dwqyu,Fable_Wright,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:20:10 2015 UTC,"This deck seems very interesting. My first thought is that this seems to almost be a value coco deck, as all the creatures are 3 CMC or less with some sort of downside to casting them normally. The beauty of coco is that you can cast it on opponent's end step, so the haste benefit with temur ascendancy isn't too great. However, I can see the card draw being pretty handy if you cast coco, get 2 creatures and draw 2 cards.   If I were you, I would up coco to 4, cut molten vortex and ditch faithless looting for 2 more creatures. This would allow you to hit creatures off coco or with vial more consistently.  I presume remand is in there for any non creature match ups that are faster than yours, I'm curious as to how often you feel it helps vs. how often you wish you had an early creature. Anywho, fun deck. I like the idea that it stemmed from."
ModernMagic,3dwqyu,kevin-kurly,2,Mon Jul 20 11:38:57 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  At the moment, Collected Company's speed makes it extremely useful for unexpectedly flashing in blockers, even without Temur Ascendancy. Flashing them in, blocking two creatures for large advantage, drawing cards and being able to hit the opponent with devastating force on the snapback is solid.  That said, at the moment, the list feels like its creature density is okay at the moment; Company rarely whiffs, and Ascendancy will often chain into insurmountable board presence fast despite the relatively low target density. I will test a higher creature density, though I would favor creatures that allow me to disrupt the opponent. Have you advice for this, outside of perhaps Witness or a sketchy Silumgar Sorcerer? Barring that, if additional targets feel unnecessary during testing, do you have advice for disruption or elements to improve card flow? As I said, the biggest issue with this deck at the moment is terrible mulligans, and cutting the cards designed to help alleviate the problem makes me cautious.  Remand is a new addition to the list; previously, it was a Stubborn Denial for fighting the Jund and Twin lists, with incidental value along the way. However, it had been severely underperforming, and I needed to improve the card flow in the deck. So far, Remand is proving interesting. I really don't have a better turn 2 play, as Tarmogoyfs will be 1/2s most of the time, Imaginary Pet will just return to my hand on upkeep (but is still fairly solid against heavy aggro), and Epochrasite will just be insignificant much of the time. After that, I don't mind keeping Remand up while vialing in creatures, and it has synergy with Company in that I can keep Company mana up, and just Remand if I see a bigger threat coming that can't be afforded. In other words, it's great on turns 2, 4, and 5+, but bad on turns 1 and 3, which is where a lot of key action happens."
ModernMagic,3dwqyu,chronoflect,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:55:12 2015 UTC,"As others mentioned, it seems like you have too few targets for Company. I would find a way to add in a 4th CoCo and some number of eternal witnesses. Being able to get CoCo back, or any other card from the graveyard, is just insane.  I also think some of your creatures are a little too cute. I would rather have 4 angels than 2 sphinxs, for example.  It seems like [[magmatic insight]] would be a better choice than faithless looting. Looting shines when you actually want cards in your grave, which this deck doesn't seem to particularly care for."
ModernMagic,3dwqyu,MTGCardFetcher,2,Mon Jul 20 15:41:19 2015 UTC,"The fourth Company is currently in the sideboard. I rarely need more than one to win a matchup, but I do recognize the value of additional having it when additional threat density is needed.  However, I will disagree with you regarding Angels. Sphinxes I can hardcast with no problem on turn 3 as stabilization tools, and provide good card selection. Illusory Angels are, however, extremely difficult to hardcast. Given the relative lack of one mana spells that I'm likely to want to cast on turn 4, they often sit in my hand as dead cards unless I have the Aether Vial. Before Company, they were undoubtedly one of the best 3-drops in the deck.  Finally, regarding Insight vs Looting: Looting is in there because, while Insight is much, much better in the lategame, Looting shines when I need to dig into lands or combo pieces, and when I do not have a vial, it never fails to have targets I don't mind discarding, like Skaab Ruinator or an Epochrasite. That said, I often do want cards in the graveyard to help Tarmogoyf reach that critical 4/5 size, and Artifact or Enchantment + Creature will help significantly. This is one of the reasons that I prefer Vexing Sphinx over Angel.  Thank you for your feedback, though. I will try the list out with additional creature density, but I'm still uncertain about the present lack of disruption. Company starts at turn 4, and some decks will have just won by then."

AoB is my favorite card, so whenever I feel like I think of something new to try with the deck, I drop whatever I'm playing (typically Twin or UWx) for a few weeks and try it out.

Aggro variations. Midrange/control variations. Trinket Mage variations. Etc.  What I've found is that an aggressive Esper rendition featuring Thopter Foundry as the main focus has been the strongest so far of all my variations. I put it on hold just a few weeks ago, but lo and behold Wizards gave us Thopter Spy Network not a few days later. Suddenly, Tezzerator was back on the menu. If you want, I can post my current list.

I think I'm done with the ensnaring bridges in modern because Tezzeret -1 --> Darksteel citadel beatdown is probably our best plan.  Wurmcoil is very necessary due to the lifelink and the body that survives damnation. esp with academy ruins!  There are many many ways to blow us out and very few ways to stop them. Game 2 and 3 are really hard -> Stony Silence, Hurkyll's recall, Shatterstorm; everyone has something against us.  IDK if I want to play chalice of the void in modern.

ModernMagic,3dv9bz,Douges,3,Sun Jul 19 23:09:25 2015 UTC,This is such a redditor comment
ModernMagic,3du2ah,Eskimosam,14,Sun Jul 19 13:52:34 2015 UTC,"I love CFB gameplay videos, but every time I see a TWoo video, I feel like he's trolling. I don't like to play armchair quarterback, but he makes enough play mistakes and strange card choices that I find it frustrating to watch his videos. I love that he tries these odd brews (66 card living end, etc) but I just wish he would test and tweak a little more before he records.  As for BTron, I don't really see what it offers over other builds. As a non-tron player, I think the challenges of tron are assembling the tron and not getting hated out (blood moon, etc). Green has better tutors for getting out the tron, but black can get threats once the tron is complete. Mono black has no response to the common hate cards against tron (moon, fulminator, ghost quarter, etc). I just don't see it as anything but a budget tron option."
ModernMagic,3du2ah,Aema,4,Sun Jul 19 19:05:17 2015 UTC,It's the worst when he doesn't even know exact text on one of the key cards in his deck and starts guessing.
ModernMagic,3du2ah,Mezriss,10,Mon Jul 20 08:20:51 2015 UTC,"It seems clunky and unreliable. I know twoo experiments for the sake of experimenting, I watch his videos a lot, but why would you want to play this over any of the main three tron variants?  U-tron is more reliable, has better card advantage/filtering and interacts better with creature-light combo decks. It is also considerably cheaper to build if you aren't running Snapcasters, damnation seems mandatory for the black deck to stand a chance.  GR Tron is faster and more consistent, it is also a superior Karn deck.  Gifts Tron is again more consistent, combined with its ability to just lock people out with Gifts/Iona and is actually pretty strong versus all the Company decks that are popular right now.  Ignoring the fact that I think it is just straight up worse than the other tron options, I don't particularly like the card choices twoo has made. Diabolic Revelation is very slow and highly unnecessary, if he cut Urza's Factory for Eye of Ugin that would make a big difference. There is also the problem of how difficult it must be to assemble tron with that build, map is the only card he has to tutor for pieces and read the bones is VERY slow and painful as well."
ModernMagic,3du2ah,awkward_raisin,5,Sun Jul 19 14:44:44 2015 UTC,"I think having multiple solid pieces of removal is a big deal in the current metagame. Combo decks aren't so hot right now - Grixis decks make those pretty miserable - apart from Twin, of course. Tron mirror is pretty bad since fewer Karns, but against creature-heavy decks I think MonoB Tron has more game than a lot of other Tron decks. Damnation outclasses red pyroclasm effects by an order of magnitude.  The discard helps against creature-light decks. Resolving a Diabolic Revelation for 2+ is pretty much good game against any deck.   I know people like to shit on unorthodox decks, but for the current metagame I think it actually has game."
ModernMagic,3du2ah,hukkaperkele,3,Sun Jul 19 15:08:36 2015 UTC,"I don't think this deck has a good twin matchup, but Tron decks never really have for what it is worth.  I don't think this version is better than any other version of tron versus creature based strategies. All tron variants are vulnerable to aggressive creature strategies after a fashion owing to how clunky the mana- base is, but the mono-black deck actually has fewer ways to interact with them than GR Tron does.  The standard removal base for GR Tron is 4x Pyroclasm, 3-4 O-Stone, 0-2 Ugin and 3 Wurmcoil is generally very hard to beat for aggressive strategies so we may as well include it. B-Tron was playing 1 Dismember, 1 GFTT, 1 Murderous Cut, 2 Damnation and 3 Wurmcoil. You can argue that the hand disruption removes creatures, but it isn't the same thing. Pyroclasm isn't as powerful as Damnation, but it is FAR easier to cast, which is very important against aggressive decks. I would also like to note, Murderous Cut is not good in Twoos deck.  Gifts Tron also runs a similar amount of removal, the three on-colour cmc 4 wraths, 4 PtE, Elesh Norn and sometimes Snapcasters to flashback spent cards.  Diabolic Revelation is still far too clunky, it requires you to invest at least 7 mana to get any meaningful value, and that also require double black so you aren't casting it til turn 5 at the earliest and you will not be able to add to the board until next turn. Resolving it will be tricky, and multiples will rot in your hand."
ModernMagic,3du2ah,awkward_raisin,5,Sun Jul 19 17:12:00 2015 UTC,"Also while I try to respect his opinion. He says literally every deck he plays is ""surprisingly competitive."" I think his evaluations of what is and isn't a competitive deck are insane at this point."
ModernMagic,3du2ah,snackies,3,Sun Jul 19 20:26:37 2015 UTC,For every deck he videos he probably has three other decks that just didn't make it. That's the way my brews work anyways.
ModernMagic,3du2ah,DA_BATTLESUIT,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:21:56 2015 UTC,"I agree, this build seems really bad. I watched the deck tech and first round and just kept asking myself ""Why play this version of tron?"". I don't understand why most of this deck was built the way it was. Diabolic Revelation seems to be the only reason to play this deck over other tron variants, and I'm not sold that's good enough."
ModernMagic,3du2ah,escplan9,8,Sun Jul 19 14:55:42 2015 UTC,"Mono-Black 'Tron is nothing new. There have been several different builds creeping around for about a year or two. This build has popped up online, and there has been some discussion about card choices on MTGSalvation. I like the idea behind the deck, and there are a surprising number of ways you can approach it.  That being said, Woo's card choices seem bit odd.  I don't see the point of Prophetic Prism in a mono-coloured deck. Platinum Angel and Sundering Titan are much less impressive when your tutors are limited, and Diabolic Revelation may not be the best card for the job given the double black in the casting cost. With only two Urborgs (why not the full four?) I'd think he'd want as few black symbols in his spells as possible. A much better card might be [[Increasing Ambition]]. Also, there's a notable lack of Drain Life spells for a black control deck. [[Exsanguinate]] would be perfect for the deck.  Mono-Black 'Tron is an interesting build. I'm just not in love with Woo's version.   On another note, given that it's Travis Woo, how did he miss a perfect opportunity to put [[Worst Fears]] into a deck?"
ModernMagic,3du2ah,Oneitsamaway,4,Sun Jul 19 16:52:35 2015 UTC,4 urborgs would be a bad idea. the card is legendary
ModernMagic,3du2ah,treystand,2,Mon Jul 20 02:19:20 2015 UTC,"With so many colourless sources, you need to guarantee that you can hit an Urborg each game to smoothe out your mana. Excess lands isn't a problem in a deck like this; colour fixing is.  Other mono-black decks with colourless lands run the full four (e.g. 8-Rack) despite being legendary."
ModernMagic,3du2ah,Oneitsamaway,3,Mon Jul 20 11:41:07 2015 UTC,well 8 rack isnt a good deck and legend ruling lands away is a bad idea for tron

ModernMagic,3du2ah,Tirinii,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:56:21 2015 UTC,"I watched the videos too, and it did seem like fun... But honestly Diabolic Revelation seemed like the only real reason to play black (though it is quite a good reason!)"

The EV of MM2015 is lower than the cost of the box.   However, the EV of playing magic is always going to be lower than the price of entry. Do you regret the $15 you spent on the intro pack that got you into the game? Do you regret the money you sunk into a standard deck that's no longer legal, or on drafts where you pulled nothing good? No. Because you had fun doing all that. When someone tells you the EV of a booster box, they're not going to include the value of the fun you have opening the packs, or drafting from it with friends, or building a cube from the pulls.

ModernMagic,3dub3b,MASTICATOR_NORD,3,Sun Jul 19 15:31:33 2015 UTC,Your best bets are probably Maelstrom Pulse or Dreadbore.
ModernMagic,3dub3b,BrohannesJahms,3,Sun Jul 19 18:15:09 2015 UTC,"Bloodghast is the best creature you can play in this type of strategy.  It plays fantastically with Dredge and provides a very significant threat late in the game when you get them down using Molten Vortex.  I tried Syphon Life in my own version of this deck a while ago and it's just too expensive for how slow it is.  If you really want to play it, use it as sideboard tech against burn.  Your best bet against planeswalkers is either to keep them off the mana they need, Thoughtseize them away, or Maelstrom Pulse them."
ModernMagic,3dub3b,pizz0wn3d,3,Sun Jul 19 16:43:28 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty happy to see someone else brewing with these cards, and I've had some pretty decent success with a list of my own. The mana base probably still needs a good bit of work, but here's what I have so far:  http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/19-07-15-vortex-loam/  Bloodghast and Vengeful pharoah are both fantastic in this deck. Pharoah in particular is great w/ lingering souls when your opponent is swinging w/ multiple dudes. Let the smallest one get through, then use pharoah to kill the big guy you blocked w/ a spirit token. Then dredge the pharoah back to your graveyard next turn.  Your list seems a little bit threat light, and doesn't seem to have much of a plan if your opponent is packing abrupt decays and pulses for your vortex (which is why I run flame jab as an alternate, though much slower, wincon)."
ModernMagic,3dub3b,jshwrd89,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:07:29 2015 UTC,"I would include more utlilty lands, and more land destruction.

ModernMagic,3dt9tb,kkslider2130,3,Sun Jul 19 06:12:33 2015 UTC,I'm fairly new but I've had some experience with delver.   My side: 1 vampiric link 2 dispel 2 magus of the moon 2 flash freeze 2 spellskite 1 anger of the gods 1 ashiok nightmare weaver 1 negate 1 engineered explosives 1 spell snare 1 deprive  Link: super good against burn. But that's like the only deck it hits. So I only have the one allocated spot because the matchup is bad.  Dispel: good against anything blue and burn. Mirrors and grixis control matchups boil down to dispels and anglers.   Magus: I like this guy because he's a blood moon that swings for 2. The matchups where we want moon usually side in to deal with moon and don't side in more removal because their colors are usually light on the stuff. The only thing he's vulnerable too is pyroclasm. I usually run out of board and drop him on the other side of any clasms. Also you're running blue so counter magic is nice to have.   Flash freeze: hits a crap ton of decks and is good against our bad matchups  Spellskite: our best hope against boggles and a host of other fringe decks. Good against burn. Decent in the mirror or against grixis control.   Anger of the gods: craps on elves and many other coco decks. Good against affinity. And also good against merfolk.  Ashiok nightmare weaver: great as a resilient threat against control. Good in matchups where there creature quality is greater than ours. Also decent in mirror for snaps and delvers  Negate: good against control burn and any combo decks  EE: great against creature based aggro decks and our only hope against a resolved choke (you gotta have something to pray for)  removes enchantments and other hard to get at things (boggles)  Spell snare: hits too many game breaking cards to not be in the 75  Deprive: sometimes a hard counter is nice to have though this is more a flex spot.  Hope this helped.
ModernMagic,3dt9tb,smiley042894,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:42:45 2015 UTC,yeah this helped a lot. I play 2 spellsnares mainboard and don't think I'll move it out. I personally opted out of dragon's claws as well for spellskite for the same reasons. When is blood moon the most important? How bad exactly is the burn matchup postboard? I think I'll try out the run them out of gas strategy.
ModernMagic,3dt9tb,smiley042894,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:47:49 2015 UTC,"The burn matchups is 20/80 game 1. If you can counter key cards (4 damage spells and eidolons) or vampiric link a beater or one of their eidolons it becomes a lot easier to win. I suggest keeping at least 1 spellskite. They are an answer for decks we normally don't have answers for (boggles burn) and just help in others (affinity, infect, burn)  Blood moon (I prefer magus of the moon) is our triumph card against amulet bloom as well as tron. It is very hard for them to deal with as the only way these decks have of removing it is either pyroclasm oblivion stone or Karn(which they shouldn't be able to cast because of the moon effect) if you don't have countermagic in hand (which, keep most counters in, they buy you time) just go beat down. If they manage to wipe your board drop magus and recoup. Young pyromancer is, I think, one of the best cards against tron as he just pushes a lot of damage through while not taking up resources that you can use to disrupt. I've played a lot of tron matchups as my brother owns the deck and its one of the most skill involved matchups."
ModernMagic,3dt9tb,DragonlordWoolie,3,Sun Jul 19 21:09:50 2015 UTC,"Youre gonna wanna have a good plan against burn. They may easily be our worst match-up.  Vampiric Link, Dragons claw, Dispel, and Flash freeze are all great choices."
ModernMagic,3dt9tb,shinigami564,2,Sun Jul 19 15:25:36 2015 UTC,My 13 looks like this.  2 dragon's claw  2 negate  2 blood moon  2 dispel  1 spell snare  1 kommand  1 flashfreeze  1 V Clique  1 self inflicted wound
ModernMagic,3dt9tb,ElvishJerricco,2,Sun Jul 19 15:27:44 2015 UTC,"Here's mine.  A bunch of counterspells has proven way better than anything else in the burn matchup, and each of them has several different matchups that you board them in for. Vandalblast should honestly probably be a shattering spree. Clique is a good combo breaker. Rending Volley hits a lot of relevant threats in blue matchups. Explosives is good against aggressive creature decks. Spellskite is another card that's good against burn as well as other matchups. Blood Moon is self explanatory. Staticaster is good against twin/blue decks that have a bunch of X/1s as well as infect.  Notable exclude: Dragons claw is too slow for burn. The counterspells may not have the long-game potential, but that's not how you beat burn. You want to stop them in their tracks until you can beat them. Dragons claw just slows the bleeding and isn't any good in other matchups."
ModernMagic,3dt9tb,Sharpeness440,2,Sun Jul 19 17:12:06 2015 UTC,"I play a lot of grixis delver in modern and I feel one of, if not the best card to battle burn is Monastery Siege. I play 2 of those and 2 Dragon's claws in my side. Siege can cripple burn, they are usually trying to cast multiple spells with very limited mana. Siege is strong all around in my opinion, it can be great for card advantage in control match ups and puts a damper on jund and junks discard and removal."
ModernMagic,3dt9tb,notiesitdies,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:30:53 2015 UTC,"here's a few that I run, or have ran at some point that haven't been mentioned yet:  Bonfire of the damned: really good against x/1's like tokens, other URx delver decks and affinity.  Rakdos Charm: I bring this in against affinity and twin.  Countersquall: One of my pet cards. Comes in against anything that doesn't run many creatures. Should probably be another flashfreeze.  Darkblast: I haven't tested this yet, but I really want too. Looks like a total house against all the decks where I'd want to bring in Bonfire.  Engineered Explosives: Good against tokens. Can also answer a resolved Geist if you'rr desperate.  Gutshot: If hate bears has you down, this can deal with Thalia efficiently. Probably not with the slot though.

I used to play this deck in Pauper tried to make it work in Modern. It's fun but not very competitive because removal in Modern is pretty good against you. It feels like Infect but not as consistent.

ModernMagic,3ds4sj,Cloud-Jumper,2,Sat Jul 18 23:46:36 2015 UTC,"Bitter Blossom is great because it only needs a 1B as opposed to Ascendency which need RWB, and it can come down a turn earlier."
ModernMagic,3ds4sj,Cloud-Jumper,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:32:28 2015 UTC,"Comes down a turn earlier, is less color intensive, yes. But you don't get the token until turn three, and you only get one per turn, where ascendancy also can give you results on turn three and could give you more than one token each turn. Plus you attack with the token on turn three, the bblossom token can attack until turn four"
ModernMagic,3ds4sj,Wolfir,2,Sun Jul 19 01:02:06 2015 UTC,"While what you stated is true, I don't want to have such a surplus of 3 drops. If I were to add something like MA I risk the chance of having way too many three drop which mess up the flow of the deck. Also, there aren't enough ""actual"" creatures to trigger Ascendency. My deck runs a total of 9, and most of the non token creatures don't really come down till later on in the game. It wouldn't make sense to drop a consistent token producer like BB for MA which only triggers off me attacking with actual creatures."
ModernMagic,3ds4sj,Cloud-Jumper,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:55:35 2015 UTC,"I like it. It seems strong. But personally, I think you have too much top-end and not enough early action.  You're essentially a midrange deck. You're a Thoughtseize-Liliana deck, just like BGx . . . but you don't have any Tarmogoyfs or Dark Confidants . . . or any two-drop creatures that you commit to the board besides Bitterblossom, which I don't know if I like in this deck. If you cast it on turn 2, it fuels your deck. But at any other point in the game, it's just too slow . . . not to mention that you might be low on resources.  I think you should have some two-drops. Young Pyromancer won't be as good in this deck as it would be in a blue deck with cantrips, but I still think it's a strong option that fits your token subtheme.   Right now, you've got 8 four-drops. You've got a 3:1 split of Butcher and Falkenrath Aristocrat, which I think should go down to 2 (of your choice, either Butcher or Aristocrat). I think you should keep the one-of Olivia Voldaren.   Sorin is a strong option as well . . . but I think that because you're so token-dependent, you should replace one copy with Elspeth, Knight-Errant . . . as Elspeth can guarantee you to produce a token every turn. You've got one Outpost Siege, which is strong but I prefer Chandra, Pyromaster. That's personal preference, though . . . Outpost Siege might very well be better."
ModernMagic,3ds4sj,Cloud-Jumper,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:54:27 2015 UTC,"The original template had 4 DA but I found that I took way too much damage from my higher end cards. And I could bump up the Number of Bitter Blossom because I agree with what you said about it. As for 2 drops I was thinking of Jotun Grunt but dropping him as early as turn 2 just feels bad when there isn't anything in the GY. It's the reason why I play 4 Rabblemaster's cause it's a house if it gets going. I can somewhat agree with the 2:2 split you suggested, I may be dropping the Falkenrath cause she doesn't synergize  well with everything else. As for Elspeth she's too slow and too hard on the Mana. She doesn't create more than 1 token the turn she comes in. I might switch to Chandra and drop 1 Sorin because she can ping those pesky 1/1's. Another reason for the higher end is because I have many removal spells, so many of their creatures shouldn't be sticking."
ModernMagic,3ds4sj,NickRick,-3,Sun Jul 19 00:38:55 2015 UTC,Possibly wastenot? Not the greatest two drop but it could work well in this deck

ModernMagic,3dsi4t,Le_Meretrix,2,Sun Jul 19 05:05:05 2015 UTC,"Build a control deck, post a list here, and we'll give you suggestions.

ModernMagic,3dsi4t,Wolfir,2,Sun Jul 19 01:18:26 2015 UTC,Grixis control. It gets you must of the way to grixis twin and grixis delver at the same time.
ModernMagic,3dsi4t,DrRichardButt,3,Sun Jul 19 05:27:25 2015 UTC,"Honestly, control isn't in a good spot in Modern right now. Jeskai Control has been trending downward for a long time and has almost fallen off of the map completely. Scapeshift (the old premier combo-control deck) has almost completely died in favor of Splinter Twin.  Grixis Control is the best control deck right now, though it tends to play more of a proactive control game than a draw-go like Jeskai did. The deck likes to land a big delve creature early and use it to take over the game, but you don't have to. The deck does have the tools to grind (such as Snapcaster Mage and Kolaghan's Command) and a large part of playing the deck is knowing when to grind or when to go all in.  You could also try Splinter Twin. It plays much more on the tempo side than the control, but it has the basic shell of removal/permission with a combo finish and can shift into a control deck post board if needed (such as against BGx). Be warned that Twin isn't really a control deck, but some of the basic principles of control apply to Twin as well."
ModernMagic,3dsi4t,MrMond4y,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:16:33 2015 UTC,"Just wondering, but do you think I would be able to run twin without the snaps, or even decks that run blue for that matter"
ModernMagic,3dsi4t,MrMond4y,3,Sun Jul 19 01:18:41 2015 UTC,"Quite frankly, no. A huge part of why Twin is so powerful is because it can shift from combo to tempo/control when needed, and Snapcaster is the #1 reason why they're able to do that (with Cryptic largely coming in second).   The synergy between Snapcaster and Kolaghan's Command (along with Snapcaster + removal) is a huge reason why Grixis Control has become so powerful as well.  I know it sucks to hear, but if you want to play any of the control/tempo decks in Modern you're going to have to get some Snaps, just like how you need Goyf to play midrange."
ModernMagic,3dsi4t,RedeNElla,2,Sun Jul 19 01:21:08 2015 UTC,"I do know one tempo deck that can get away with running no snaps, but it runs 4 goyfs so it's far from helpful for OP."

As for if control is just bad delver, I really don't think it is. It depends on what you're gonna face, and I don't think either one is particularly more well suited to the meta than the other."
ModernMagic,3dsi4t,mattbattt,0,Sun Jul 19 17:39:05 2015 UTC,Absolutely incorrect about Jeskai being dead.

ModernMagic,3dsi4t,BonerComplex,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:19:27 2015 UTC,"Save yourself the time and the money, and don't. I'm assuming you're referring to 'draw-go' control, in the traditional sense. The only decks in modern that fit that description are the ancient UWr control decks popularized in 2011-2012.   They are not very good. Your 'good' matchups aren't all that easy, and your bad matchups are absolutely horrendous. Most matchups are an uphill grind, and more than often, game 1 is lopsided in their favor. Going to time is a real possibility. There is very, very little card draw or library manipulation spells, which make the deck susceptible to flooding.  I pushed several types of control (Esper, UWr, UW) in modern. After over a year, I decided it wasn't worth it. Why win on turn 20 with Colonnade if you can win on turn 4 with Splinter Twin?   I now happily reside with Miracles in Legacy."

ModernMagic,3dsi4t,Spotred,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:16:18 2015 UTC,I think one of the numerous Twin variants would be your best bet.
ModernMagic,3dsi4t,JexInfinite,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:27:02 2015 UTC,"First I think it's wise to define how competitive you want to be. To my knowledge there is four main control routes in modern and those are UW, Jeskai, Esper and Grixis. From a spike stand point Grixis control is the only relevant deck in the current meta, though the other options  can still win games if you're a committed pilot.   Coming from the burn playstyle you could go a familiar route in Jeskai which emphasize on burn spells. Grixis is close but only utilize Lightning Bolt. Or a new way of playing the game with UW/ Esper.  Personally I'm brewing UW Control and really enjoy the deck. I think modern control benefits from the ""protect the queen"" approach and that's why I test Myth Realized, though I believe Grixis is the best at the moment with Tasigur and Angler."
ModernMagic,3dsi4t,ElvishJerricco,0,Sun Jul 19 08:41:24 2015 UTC,"Learning control is not just something you can do. You need to first be very experienced in the format and in deckbuilding for it to even be considered. Control is a very difficult deck to play, especially in this current meta. You need to be really skilled to do well with it, but when you reach a certain point, you can definitely win games.  Most people would point you in the direction of Twin, because that's an 'easier' deck to learn. Twin is probably the best deck at the moment because it can just win out of nowhere, but you still need to know the format to do well with it. It's just easier to pull off wins with T1 decks than control.  The best advice is to play what you want. If you're looking for established decks, you could play Twin, or Grixis. I would recommend doing that before moving into a 'true' control deck, if you even want to."

ModernMagic,3drczl,UltiPizza,2,Mon Jul 20 06:20:07 2015 UTC,"http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/ink-treader-nephilim-modern/  This is a pretty rough version.  It needs more consistency, especially a way to reliably get Ink-Treader.  You win by drawing your deck, casting a bunch of spells for Inky to copy and eating them with Nivmagus, then either attacking for lethal, or using fling to kill them.  The secondary wincons are using [[Strength in Numbers]] to give all your creatures +X/+X equal to the number of attacking creatures and trample, or if your opponent is playing a creature based deck casting Act of Treason and killing him with his own stuff.  Teferi and Lab maniac have been relegated to the sideboard because most of the time it sucked to draw them.  The other wincons can kill without even fully going off, and Act of Treason can simply be another untap and haste spell if you need it to go off.  The one-of past in flames has made the deck go off when it otherwise couldn't have in testing, and I'm seriously considering another one, because they allow you to safely use all your wisps and refocus as cantrips to dig for Ink-Treader.  In testing I've noticed that 1 land hands are generally fine, and more than 3 is way too much.  You should never keep a hand without a 1 mana mana dork.  An ideal hand is 3 mana dorks, 2 lands, Inky, and a cerulean wisps.  If you then draw more wisps and 1 more land, you'll go off on turn 3 and win assuming you can hit one of your 14 drawing spells/past in flames (with enough mana) each time you cast one.  The deck is oddly like Storm in some ways, except that their digging spells are better until we get Ink-Treader on the field.  I think the matchup is very bad against burn, so the sideboard will mostly have to be burn hate.  I could see [[Asceticism]] in the board for that matchup."

Molten Vortex helps, but you're still taking a lot of damage from your lands because you need to fetch for shocks most of the time in turn 1-3 (due to 1RR for Crusher and 1GW for Knight).  Weak to fast combo draws (mainly Twin, Amulet, Living End and Grishoalbrand). You use a lot of synergy cards to make your deck work, so you can't really disrupt your opponent, but you can't kill earlier than turn 5 (maybe occasionally 4)."

ModernMagic,3drpyh,BockenEagle,3,Sat Jul 18 20:34:57 2015 UTC,Would merfolk interest you? It's a Tempo deck but I mean tempo is basically Aggro+Control so it still has control elements.   The full deck is 450 USD but you could easily make a few budget substitutions.
ModernMagic,3drpyh,Edward_Dionysos,2,Sun Jul 19 03:04:48 2015 UTC,I've looked into it but never really saw something fun about it. But I guess I could consider it if its a good deck.
ModernMagic,3drpyh,Edward_Dionysos,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:15:25 2015 UTC,There are a lot of YouTube videos on it so maybe check a few out or proxy the deck out to see if it's for you.
ModernMagic,3drpyh,turtlenecksareforme,5,Sun Jul 19 16:28:59 2015 UTC,"In all honesty, I don't think you can play a 'competitive' combo/control deck for that price. I would get into the format with mono green stompy as it's competitive and cheap. As a budget-ish deck, maybe start with UR delver?

ModernMagic,3drpyh,Kiethong,2,Sun Jul 19 07:51:16 2015 UTC,"Check out the decks that are doing well in Modern lately. Read about how they work, what their matchups are like against each other and the rest of the field, how much they cost to build, etc.  That will help you make your decision. Then, when you have more specific questions, we can be more useful to you.  For what it's worth, I don't believe there are any very competitive combo or control decks at your budget, which is very low for a Modern deck. Maybe Amulet Bloom or Goryo's Vengeance decks (whose recent prices I don't know), but I'm sure you've read about those already."

ModernMagic,3drpyh,billtrociti,2,Sun Jul 19 16:00:11 2015 UTC,"Ok, so I've been looking into Pox Loam lately and to me it feels like the very different control deck I should learn to play (I tend to go for aggro decks because something about doing the smashy fast appeals to me...), and it may be what you are looking for too.   Is it control? Quite so. As the pox loam player you're constantly giving your opponent awkward lines of play (eg: thinking of attacking with your tasigur? Not while I have a [[vengeful pharaoh]] in da yard; you better cast that helix now while you still have a red source, etc.) and denying them resources. Is it combo? Depends on your definition of combo. After softening your target up with zombies, you can often go in for the kill with [[Conflagrate]] dealing on avg 8-13 damage - and it's alright if they counter it! By this point, you've probably left them in such a rut they shouldn't have a decent threat, so you dredge back yo loams and do it all again next turn. Competitive? Well it's certainly powerful, and I think it would see more play if it wasn't so bloody hard to pilot - the lines of play with each hand are so numerous it's sometimes irritating.   Oh yeah, and if you have the land base (which isn't bad at all - khans fetches and jund coloured shocks), all you really need to buy are [[Bloodghast]]s and [[Life from the Loam]]s; the rest is dirt cheap."

ModernMagic,3drpyh,PeterTheBard,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:00:41 2015 UTC,"Any reason you want to get a new deck right away? I would take your current budget and start getting cards towards a new deck and get new pieces whenever you can afford them. Right now, even decks like Burn and Merfolks which are usually considered the ""cheap"" way into modern are 2+ times your budget.  Right now is also a bad time to buy into Modern if you're on a budget. If I were in your situation I would proxy a bunch of interesting decks and play them until I find something I really like and then start buying the pieces slowly. You won't have a deck right away but at least you'll have something you can play for a while in a couple of weeks/months. I feel like spending 200 â‚¬ right now will get you a deck you'll be unable to improve and will want to ditch soon, wasting your initial investment.  Another option is to build something but removing some of the more expensive cards for now. This will make most decks way less competitive but you'd have something to build towards. The issue is that combo decks usually need most of their pieces to work properly (if at all) and control decks rely on expensive lands (but that are usually a good investment since you can reuse them).  One last suggestion for modern on a budget: decks are usually way cheaper on MTGO. If you really just want to play competitively and don't mind doing it online that could be a way to go. Currently online, you could easily build Merfolks, Bogles and Burn for < 2000 â‚¬."
ModernMagic,3dq3pw,thatblackguyyouknow1,4,Sat Jul 18 10:12:32 2015 UTC,"Atarka's command - Gatherer, MC Bump in the night - Gatherer, MC Cracking doom - Gatherer, MC Norin the Wary - Gatherer, MC Self-inflicted Wound - Gatherer, MC Wild Nactl - Gatherer, MC Self-post reply - Format: Image - Gatherer - MagicCards"
ModernMagic,3dq3pw,MTGCardFetcher,4,Sat Jul 18 10:13:00 2015 UTC,"Having access to more repeatable damage sources (Wild Nacatl) and a more creature-centric strategy overall is going to make Naya Burn the definitive stronger choice if your meta is more combo-centric. If Wild Nacatl deals 0 damage (i.e. if it gets removed right away), then it was worse in your deck than a regular Lava Spike . . . ergo, the Naya Burn deck is strongest when facing a deck that is primarily pro-active and less interactive. These decks include Storm, Infect, Bloom Titan, Elves, etc. In general, Wild Nacatl is worse against the decks with Lightning Bolt, as they have a better chance of removing it before it deals any damage. On the flip side, if Wild Nacatl can't be interacted with and gets in for two attacks, it dealt more damage than a regular burn spell.  The Mardu burn deck has access to Bump in the Night, which is simply another Lava Spike. However, as you mentioned, the sideboard cards (Self-Infected Wound, Crackling Doom) can help you win against Boggles, which is an incredibly difficult match-up . . . as you can just never beat Daybreak Coronet.   PMayne's deck tech for Naya Nacatl Burn . . . and him losing to Boggles  If you have Affinity in your meta, you can play either deck with three or more copies of Smash to Smithereens in your sideboard . . . and hopefully win. However, you could also play Kolaghan's Command in your board against Affinity if you're playing the Mardu deck . . . or Destructive Revelry if you're playing the Naya deck.  Naya Burn may have a better game 1 against Living End, but Rakdos Charm would be an decent sideboard against them, as you could exile their graveyard . . . or just deal them four to six damage (one damage for each creature they control) after Living End resolves.   Ultimately, you could play either list . . . and just tailor your sideboard to your meta."
ModernMagic,3dq3pw,Wolfir,3,Sat Jul 18 17:12:20 2015 UTC,"If living end and affinity are dominant at your LGS, Mardu feels better.

However, it's got its bad matchups, and I list affinity as one of those, which is why I think mardu or jund would be better of you see a lot of that."
ModernMagic,3dq3pw,Grig134,2,Sat Jul 18 15:16:23 2015 UTC,Bump in the main and self-inflicted wound in the side are both good but I don't think they have anything on green cards. Atarkas Command is basically Boros charm 5-8 with upside of alternatively blanking lifegain. If you have multiple creatures out it can easily deal 4+ damage. Destructive revelry is also better sideboard tech then self inflicted wound or wear/tear.  I've also been messing with a singleton become immense maindeck. It's bad against decks with lots of removal but in most burn matchups people will just remove whatever your early creatures are and ignore a later drop.

You also get rakdos charm and rain of gore in your sideboard. Naya burn is probably overall the strongest, but Jund is also solid."
ModernMagic,3dq3pw,Lucas46,2,Sat Jul 18 13:50:35 2015 UTC,"Me being the insane fucker that I am, I put in a blood crypt in my Naya Burn deck, for 1 Tasigur, 2 Rakdos Charms, 1 Rain of Gore in my sideboard.  The theory for Tasigur is against match-ups where the game will most likely turn into a grind (Abzan, Melira Company, UWr control), but I haven't determined if it's worth it or not to run it.  Rakdos Charm is just a card that I find underused. It hoses decks with Voice of Ressurgence  or the graveyard. It's also a kill spell against affinity and you can still deal 5 or so damage at instant speed.  Rain of Gore is mostly against the Melira Company deck.  I haven't determined if the Naya splashing Black Burn deck is better than any other version, but hey. SCIENCE! I've been enjoying the black splash. Rakdos Charm HAS earned its place and if I don't like the rest, I may straight up go Mardu or Jund burn just for the charm."
ModernMagic,3dq3pw,guywhoyoubarelyknow,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:00:59 2015 UTC,"There are pros and cons to each.   Naya:  Atarkas command is great. It can be Boros charm 5-8 (sometimes better with heavy creature starts)or skull crack 3-6 depending on the situation.  Destructive Revelry: 18x better than wear//tear for the simple fact that it gets an extra 2 damage.  Grim lavamancer: better in naya than in mardu  Mardu:  Bump in the night: acceptable. This is the black lava spike. I have never lost a game because I didn't draw enough lava spikes  Tasigur: among the best creatures in modern. Dodges bolt and abrupt decay. Delve is super easy with the amount of fetches/non permanents, but makes lavamancer worse  Rakdos charm: good against other players delve, extra artifact hate is always nice, and would be great against twin if it didn't get countered every time.  Crackling doom: sweet removal +2 damage. Dodges spell skite, and gets who you want most of the time. A bit expensive for burn though  K command: discard isn't what we want, our creatures are generally bad past turn 3 (except tasigur), this is basically a worse revelry. Side note, if you Try to destroy an artifact and deal 2, spell skite can redirect both at once  Conclusion: I believe naya is generally better, because you have to make bigger compromises with mardu. That being said, if you're in a burn heavy meta, I would go mardu. Because tasigur is great. Hope this helps!"

That said, I get what you're wanting to do and I get the appeal, and it depends on the context you're playing in.  FNM?  Is it a competitive FNM environment?  If so, unlikely to win.  If it's fairly casual and weird brews abound, I'm sure you can score some wins.  If it's with your buddies around a kitchen table, and you all have similar power levels of decks, sure.  At any rate probably some [[Polluted Delta]], cut the Backwaters and put in some Islands and more fetches, otherwise [[Blood Moon]] is going to take an unfortunate sized poop on you.  Drop Doom Blade, run [[Go for the Throat]].  Run 1 [[Arena]].  Fun times with Obliterator.  You desperately need to be running some number of [[Thoughtseize]]s and [[Inquisition of Kozilek]]s, you have literally 1 turn 1 play - Gravecrawler; they add some interaction and disruption and give you something to do.  If it's kitchen table stuff, [[Duress]] and [[Despise]] are acceptable replacements.  Cut Army of the Damned.  You'll either already be winning or have lost by t8, it'll be a dead card more often than not.  Not sure I like negate, probably just run more removal or something like [[spell snare]] or [[spell pierce]].  What's your goal with the Swords?  Seems unwieldy in a deck so full of 3drops where your goal is lorded zombies.  I'd drop them.    Anyone feel free to correct me if I've said something retarded, which I probably did."
ModernMagic,3dr3wq,chrysPAINthemum,3,Sat Jul 18 17:24:25 2015 UTC,"Know the meta it's important, modern it's a ""turn 4"" format wich means most of the fastest matchups would end at turn 4 generally. At this moment the meta has an huge espectrum by turn 1 or 2 you have to figure versus what deck you are playing and what way to play around things (example: If you figure you are versus twin he might mainboard blood moon so you might fetch for basics for secure your mana base or hold removers in case of combo etcetc). If you are playing gifts tron like you said sometime you should hold that extra tron land in your hand in case he might play a fulminator or anything like that. Your priority as a control deck it's to have a stable board and a secure life total then smash (talking grosso modo), search tutorial for what to sideboard and how cause 2nd game it's where things change and 3th game it's more like a mindgame sometimes if you or your opponent sided again."
ModernMagic,3dr3wq,Razorsoldier,2,Sat Jul 18 17:58:38 2015 UTC,"I think this is the best advice, but I would like to add to it, know YOUR meta.  Decklists you get online are likely tuned to a wide array of decks the builder was expecting to face at a 100+ person tournament.  If you are playing at your LGS, you will likely go up against the same 5-10 decks on a weekly basis.  Play for a while and figure out what is beating you, and what was a dead draw for you.  The flex slots in UW Tron are likely to be: Remand, Condescend, Repeal, Path to Exile, and Signets (mostly number adjustments, not cutting all together).  If you have a lot of GR Tron in your meta, a maindeck Ghost Quarter might be the right call (the first list that came on up on google only had 1 in the board).  You may also want an extra Expedition Map to find it easier (the same list only had 2 maps maindeck).  If there is a lot of twin, you may want a maindeck Aether Spellbomb or 2.  Figure out what roll each card in your deck is filling, and adjust it to what you need your deck to do."
ModernMagic,3dr3wq,lolzbox,2,Sat Jul 18 23:23:50 2015 UTC,I would say start at mtgtop8 and go through the top decklists.

See if you can identify similarities between decks in terms of core cards and then try and figure out how their gameplan changes depending on the rest of the deck.
ModernMagic,3dr3wq,turtlenecksareforme,2,Sat Jul 18 19:59:00 2015 UTC,Research. You need to read primers on all the different decks that are out there and learn how they work. Then learn how to fight them and especially how to side board against them.

ModernMagic,3dptc4,cromonolith,3,Sat Jul 18 07:21:02 2015 UTC,Gftt by big margin. Both because doom blade is bad (lots of important creatures in black right now) and Gftt is really good (plays around kite and vs affinity terminate/K command/bolts are already enough)
ModernMagic,3dptc4,DuurHuur,6,Sat Jul 18 14:40:28 2015 UTC,Victim of night i probably better than those two
ModernMagic,3dptc4,Nahhnope,9,Sat Jul 18 11:08:41 2015 UTC,Definitely not in Grixis.

ModernMagic,3dptc4,Nahhnope,13,Sat Jul 18 13:35:25 2015 UTC,You want to be able to cast it.  Grixis doesn't hit double black very easily.  You also don't want your removal turned off by a blood moon.

Anafenza's Company (which is basically Podless Pod) runs it, as does Elves (it's a tier 2 deck).  Naya Zoo uses it.  Basically, it's really good at flashing in small, high impact creatures."
ModernMagic,3dsceq,towishimp,2,Sun Jul 19 00:18:58 2015 UTC,"To add on, I use it in my Zoo and Hatebears decks, in short because it does something green usually can't do: play creatures at instant speed.  With CoCo, you can play a threat or two, and then sit back on CoCo mana.  If they boardwipe you, you can CoCo EOT and keep beating without losing a beat.  Or if your opponent makes a series of plays to stabilize, you can CoCo EOT to destroy their combat math.    Decks like Anafenza Company and Elves use it as a way to psudo-tutor for combo pieces, besides just generating value."

ModernMagic,3dp54t,AcademyRuins,0,Sat Jul 18 13:42:34 2015 UTC,Eh. I wouldn't say that about grixis. It definitely plays like a tempo deck. Just because a deck has a lot of good cards doesn't mean it's a goodstuff deck with no particular strategy.
ModernMagic,3dp54t,megathrasher,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:12:16 2015 UTC,"Grixis Delver is more a control deck that cuts the Cryptics and some removal for Delvers. It's a Grixis, midrange-y, aggro control deck that has a shitty tempo plan B if your opener has a Delver. I personally feel it's a half measure and you're better off playing Grixis Control for a more consistent strategy.  RUG does not want the game to go long, it aims to jam one or two threats and disrupt your opponent's game plan if prevents you from winning. You're looking to use most of your countermagic to save your threats and ride them out, Grixis's threats are very easy to answer and get trumped quickly; Tasigur is an end game card unless you have Thought Scour."
ModernMagic,3dp54t,ElvishJerricco,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:11:21 2015 UTC,Because one has real removal and the other doesn't

ModernMagic,3dp54t,nadalska,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:21:34 2015 UTC,"Because it's an absolute blow out.  To be able to curve Delver, into Goyf, into Monkey AND blanking a Bolt or a Terminate while you do so often results in the other person not winning that match.  You 2-1 yourself but that's a tempo deck, you trade cards to buy yourself enough tempo to kill the other guy before they can stablize."
ModernMagic,3dp54t,megathrasher,-4,Sat Jul 18 17:26:44 2015 UTC,I feel like two for oneing yourself is kind of a non-bo.
ModernMagic,3dp54t,hailgiovanni,4,Sat Jul 18 06:12:33 2015 UTC,Many decks are disposed to sacrifice card advantage for such a tempo swing. RUG delver is one of them

Disrupting shoal was brought in as an out against path to exile, which was the only thing that killed monkeys (as people weren't on much grixis yet). It lets you be aggressive and tap out as early as the second turn and still hold up permission for their removal. It also gives you basically byes against combo decks."

ModernMagic,3dp54t,Trei_Gamer,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:35:12 2015 UTC,"Swiftspear seems unnecessary. Not worth sinking extra spells into (on your turn, no less) to get +1/+1. It was different when you could easily reload with Treasure Cruise but I'm not sure that 'Spear makes the cut solely based on the face that it applies no pressure on it's own.  The goal is to stick a Delver, Goyf or Mandrel and go into semi-control mode. Don't want to be tapping out on your turn to power her up.    Â  It appears you're anti-Shoal judging by your comments below but I hope you to give it a shot. Very valuable to protect one of your few threats or to knock combo off by a turn or two. Â     I'm running two copies of Blood Moon in the main and have found that they're always useful, even against burn (cutting off 2nd or 3rd color - board out game two though). Purely a meta call if they fit your usual opponents. Â  I'd cut 4x Swiftspear for 2 Snaps and 2 Simic Charm. Also cut the Spell Pierce for another Denial.

For a T3 CoCo, and smoothness overall you need 6 or 7 T1 mana dorks in the deck. Personally I think you should be fine running BoPs as a 4 of if you can. They can become far more relevant than a Noble Hierarch if you are ticking up a Gavony Township in the grindy late game. (Township combos well with Knight of the Reliquary)  I currently have a lend of 1 Noble Hierarch from a friend. Filling the slot of my 6th dork is an Avacyn's Pilgrim. It is not even fair to compare him to Hierarch, but it is a T1 dork that provides the fixing you need in a GWx deck, and is a cheap filler to the spot. It also attacks for 1 damage. If you dont have the Noble Hierarch, this is your guy.  Yes Hierarchs are a great addition to any Zoo deck, but personally I feel that a BoP is better in any deck that wants to swing with everything.
