We were in like ten musicals together and it's just weird knowing that I won't see that guy again or talk to him. And like I just cleared off space on my computer including videos of him rehearsing stuff. Really surreal.

I know that your initial reaction to this song choice was not the most favorable, but I know I am not alone in saying that you turned it and gave us so much character and emotion. All-in-all, you destroyed it. =)  Pierre: YESSSSSS. You were absolutely rad, Pierre! The camera timestamp, the jazzercise, the entire performance was so amazing and on point that I couldn’t keep the smile off my face. Bravo, good sir! This was you at your finest.  Holyschtick: This was superb, Hannah! The swinging, the lighting, the vulnerability – you gave us an excellent depiction of the song and you should be stoked about your performance this week. Plus, the boulder at the end make me crack up =). Way to go!  Axel: Dude, you have no idea how impressed I am with the way you handled this video. I know this song was supremely difficult, but you provided an exceptional concept that was adorable and fit your personality. You’ve hit a great marker, dude, where you have turned a song into your own. Be proud!  Gloria: HOLY FUCK. You Chad Michaels’d the fuck out of that song and really lived up to the character and style to which you hold yourself. You should be exceptionally happy with your performance this week, because this is without a doubt the pinnacle of your videos thus far. However, I’m sure you’ll continue to amazing us as the competition continues.  Viqule: This is my inspiration this week . Also, OH MY GOD DRAG IS SO HARD.  Gii-Face: Hehehehehehehe, gii. I know you were on the struggle bus about this video this week, but I want you to continue to realize how amazing and funny you are. You were deliciously raunchy and really brought the humor to this horrible, terrible song =).    GWMW: Duder, you were absurd and I loved every moment of it. The yoga, the coca-cola, the Wendy’s and pizza, everything about this is why I am so happy you are in this competition along with me. I would have not been able to give a fraction to the concept you delivered with Björk this week. Be proud.  Edie: You know you got Gabe excited with this video! You gave such a great range of emotions and expressions that is it clear why you are here and appreciated. Plus, that outfit makes me want to go out on cougar night with you – I’ll buy the drinks!   Sunday: BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Your outfit was so amazing, Sunday, and your backdrop and equipment made it feel for legitimate. Giving us bondage for our nerves, I hope you got the same number of laughs that I did from this video, duder =).  Keep it up, everyone. This week is so epic and intimidating, and it is all because of the amazing videos you guys are delivering! Y’all rock!"

This week was really fantastic and most weeks I don't really have many critiques for other people so I don't just want to go YOU'RE TERRIBLE AXEL.  But sometimes, your lighting obscures half of your mouth for me, and that's a problem. I can't really tell if you're syncing properly or not. It also has something to do with the fact you enjoy shooting in monochrome, which is fine! but make sure you have the best lighting possible for that as anything not in the light is just completely dark.  This is real talk. You're really great and everyone enjoys you, so just take my words with a pinch of salt! But that's what I've noticed from you."

As for the elimination, I worried all week that this might happen, and I am truly sorry that it did.  Hopefully, no matter what the outcome, we can all remember to view this as a fun game we're all playing together. There are a million different ways of measuring success. You have the confidence to put these videos out on the internet for all to judge. You have the talent to make an audience smile and laugh and cheer and even cry. You have the emotional openness to become part of a community of online friends and lip sync enthusiasts. I'm proud of you all."

Thank you for all the encouragement and support that I had last week. I was ready to get back out there and slay but it was a little too late. I think I would carrion cause I do care about the competition. It was my outlet for creativity. I genuinely had fun in creating every video. I would still lipsync as if I was in the competition cause I don't want to do anything half-assed.   I really appreciate the people here. I would like to apologize if someone/people were hurt by whatever I said cause turns out I was a little too cut throat with you guys.  I hope you all still slay the competition and continue doing your best. I'm here if ever you need anything. I'll be waiting to see what you'll do next week so don't fuck it up!  Merci à tous! Gros bisous. - Calypso Overkill

One slip up or off week and your seemingly solid position can fall dramatically. I hope to see more from the eliminated contestant because you were one of my favorites coming into this season."

I wanted y’all to have a bit of positive encouragement/critiques, mainly as a reminder of how awesome you people are =). This competition is so intense & you guys are the reason why it is so amazingly good. Keep up being as rad as you are =).  Gii-face: THIS SIDE OF YOU! I LOVE IT!!! Legit, though, it was an absolute honor to see you open up like that. You gave us sex appeal, a difficult song, and a performance that once was completely outside of what all of us (and probably even you) ever imagined doing. I am so happy to see this video come from you, friend.  Edie: This was so magical and bizarre. You gave the perfect characterization, and the overall effect brought this video to life a million times over. Keep doing what do you, because it is joyous to us all. The “hand”iwork of your family was an extra perk :).  Pierre:  I love the sock-puppet-realness, the gender change, the song choice, and your performance in general. You gave us a different side of you this week, which I enjoyed a lot. Keep up the diversity. I look forward to what you bring us from Joan’s hat.   Ko Rook: You gave us swanky comedic woodland amazingness. I enjoyed your slideshow so much, as it fits the Flight-of-the-Concordsesque song type, and your manliness intimidates me wildly. Definitely keep up the fun personality you give us, duder!  Axel: What I love most about this video is how different the song genre is compared to your typical body of work. Watching your talent and abilities grow over this year, as well as during this competition, has been super-rad, and I am glad you gave us goofy Axel; it made my chuckle a bit =).   Viqule: What’s black and white and re(a)d all over? Your video.  Holyschtick: This video was super-adorable =). I like that you switched it up and gave us a closed-frame video, and the location, song genre, and camp you offered was exceptionally fun. I look forward to your antics next week!  Gloria: You give amazing face and mouth, offering all the emotion and aesthetic that encapsulates you into that character. It’s obvious that you’re a theatre kid, and you possess such a strong talent in that.  Calypso: The thing I enjoy the most from this video is the absolute bonkers the video is. You gave us a performance that is twisted and something I would expect to see in a B-movie John Waters-esque release, and I can always appreciate that.   LSunday: THIS WAS EPIC. If this is how you want your brand of videos to be released, please do it. Go over the top and be completely true to you, ‘cause you are probably the only person here that can deliver this kind of performance. It offers the diversity that makes this competition so great, and I am so glad you created this ball of insanity and absurdity for us to watch.  GWMW: DUDE. This was absolutely beautiful and wonderful and the perfect way to end this list and the best way to end this week for me. This weekend, the filming included, had bundled me with a torment of emotions, and like a gentle rain, it cleared the path for me this week. Thank you. If this week does not become your definitive work in Season 3, I am beyond enthralled to see what you have for us next."

Calypso - You gave us gaposis that rivaled Condi and a concept that rivaled Pearl in Shakesqueer Episode. But it could be worse. You could have been Max in Snatch Game.  LSunday - Who knew Matthew Broderick was your male dopplegänger? Your drunk choir was charming and reminiscent of my Southern Baptist days. I'm convinced you should do a one-person Sister Act.

I didn't want to do a song of yours (which was amazing) without your approval, so I am super-grateful. Apparently, my video is blocked in Mexico currently, so Here is a Link to it from Drop Box  A ""Fun"" article about the town where I worked this summer. I lived 30 minutes from here when I was a teenager. When I was in high school, a student got beaten up for being gay. During the discussion of it in class, one student flat out said, ""We should just hang him."" No one chastised him, punished him, or did anything, as me and my best friend stared at him, seething, just counting down the days until we got out of that county. Being outside the bounds of heteronormativity in the south can often still be a death sentence, and that was the energy I used with the video."

Sell me the story of your song. Look at Ko Rook, viquele and LSunday (who did a great job this week) for story telling inspirations.  holyschtick solid sync here but your energy seemed to not always be on the same level as the songs.   There are moments when you go huge with facial expression but the song demands something more subtile and vice versa.  msgloriaswansong I almost wished you went bigger with your gestics. It's a very faithful adaptation of the source material. But, and it was the same with last weeks sync, I need you to go over the top. Good just will note be enough in the comings weeks.

You're so good at layering critique.  What my concept was supposed to be was the first half shows that I'm the top jelly salesman and the viewer is thinking ""How? How is he so good at selling jelly?  I must know!""  And then the second half shows that I use what my mama gave me to sell jelly. So I use jelly to sell jelly.  That said, this next week I'm really going to make sure I choose a song that fits my concept really well. And TRY to not go over the top, haha.   Thank you thank you THANK YOU for doing this."

The headphones weren't my first choice, but I had to film pretty early in the morning and I was on an open air balcony in a palazzo where everyone keeps their windows open.... So that was me sparing myself an Italian temper... But I think it also works in a way to make it seem like a 'jam out' session. I tried to channel my high school DDR/ParaPara armography skillz. If I had the liberty, there would have been a deathdrop and/or a Fosse split in there somewhere. Ultimately, I'm proud of the sync because I had no idea what she was saying in this song for the longest time!"

LSFYL,3bh0lf,deathcabscutie,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:19:49 2015 UTC,"Hey, I only really started checking out /r/LSFYL last week when the Golden Oldies videos went up. After catching up with all 4 weeks of videos, and seeing a LOT of talented performers, I have to say you're one of my favorites (actually you're my #1 favorite, but there are a lot of others who are amazing too). The characterization you bring to your lip syncs really resonates with me. I can picture the full scene and the other characters you're interacting with, even when you're barely moving. What a great thing to watch! Do you do theatre/musical theatre? You lip sync like someone who regularly sings or acts (or both?)."
LSFYL,3bh0lf,EdieCentric,2,Thu Jul 2 18:13:59 2015 UTC,"Hey! Welcome to the sub!  Thanks so much, that's really kind :) I don't really act...I'm a vocalist and a musical director.  You should post a lip sync on the carrion thread! X"
LSFYL,3bh0lf,ClaudiaEisout,8,Thu Jul 2 23:36:40 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'm back. I did watch last week, but was stupidly busy and couldn't find time to do my special brand of ""critiques"".   viqule - I thought for sure, based on the still from the video, that you'd be doing ""Candy Shop"". Ya little trickster! I think there were a few bits where you were unsure of the lyrics? Or were you just distracted by the falling candy? Idk. I did appreciate the bit near the end though with the chocolate sauce. You could do that next week with like...hummus or alfredo sauce...hmmm.  LSunday - This was fun! I could tell you were getting more into it as the song progressed. I wish you would have set the bottle of wine down sooner though, don't let the props hinder you! Give it everything!  axeknight0717 - Another perfect song choice for you (I didn't get to say it for last week, but I really enjoyed your choice as well). You could improve on your memorization of lyrics (I think as I rewatched you may have switched the order of two lines in the last verse) but overall I think the sync was tight and your choreo was good. Keep it up!  thelettergii - What a beautiful dedication. And even for the ""shabby quality"" you claim, I think it worked in your favor, very raw and powerful, and the changes in the lighting were very in tune with the mood of the lyrics. Good luck with the rest of your tour!  Calypso Overkill - You keep killing me every week, girl! You look absolutely stunning, the sync was on point. I am so sorry I ever doubted you! You are definitely the black horse of the competition in my book.   GWMW - actual footage of me viewing this sync Very well thought out and executed concept! I must say, I am quite jelly of your skills!  msgloriaswansong - actual footage of me viewing this sync GIRL. You are a fucking gem, I loved every second of this! I am so sorry if you wanted a constructive comment because I am just too stunned by this whole thing to come up with one! Love love love.  pierrecruz - As soon as the music started I was like. You are always so entertaining, you are always 1000% committed.   Ko Rook - YOU. You you you...You know how Claudia feels about you. What I'm not a fan of is the split screen/multiple syncers play. It's a risky move, we've seen it a few times in this competition. But I think it really worked for you this week. Keep it up, don't ever change, I love you.   holyschtick - This was so fun! Fully realized concept, great use of props and cameos, perfect song choice. Wonderful!  Also, I approve of this growing trend of toplessness. I will do anything for that to continue."

LSFYL,3bh0lf,TheHarperValleyPTA,6,Wed Jul 1 07:31:05 2015 UTC,"Ok, I know things about this situation have gotten really heated,  so my best advice to all the competitors: worry about yourselves. Instead of spending your energy stressing about who is staying, who is going, who might be disqualified,  just focus on creating a good video for next week. Joan is a fair person, she's not going to go out of her way to fuck people over. She'll make a decision, and we will move on. There's absolutely NO point in stressing out over a situation that you have no control over (especially you, spectators). Believe me, I completely understand how much this competition means to people. At the end of the day, though, this is supposed to be for FUN, and it is WAY too early in the season for you guys to be freaking out this much. It hurts my heart to see you guys putting all of this pressure on yourselves already, and I honestly think that a lot of you are going to get burnt out before the competition ends if you keep this up. It's okay to not have a crazy concept every single week. It's okay to have weeks that are weaker than others. It's okay to have a simple lip sync. I want ALL of you to do well and to get everything you are looking for out of this competition, but I also want you to enjoy it. Focus on yourselves and having fun, try not to overthink everything, and leave the tough decisions to Joan."

LSFYL,3bh0lf,AgentFear,7,Thu Jul 2 17:29:15 2015 UTC,"Voting Scandals! People leaving the Competition! Big Butts! Oh my! Lots of things going on this week. Let's get into it, shall we? Ok? Awright? OKAY?    Viqule: I dig the concept, I think the look and setting were rad (rainbow eggs?). I clocked near the end of the video that you kept looking off the camera. It threw me off, so just pay attention to little things like that. LSunday: You did a good job conveying the lyrics of the song with your concept. There were parts where your actual sync was sloppy, so keep an eye on that. You could have been more energetic with a few parts and mixed in the drunk parts during the down parts.  AxelKnight: This is, by far, your best video. This was fantastic and this is what we need to see from you from now on. When you ask ""What do you mean by diva attitude?"", look at this video and compare it to your other ones. This video had a diva attitude.  Gii: This was melancholy and sweet and I liked it but there were some technical difficulties. What I do like is that you really showed what the song was about and I felt it in your sideways glances and your generally sad demeanor. It felt natural.  Dazey: Sorry to see you drop out of the competition. I wish you the best and hope you're in good spirits.  Calypso: This was a drop down from last week. Last week, you were giving us everything.. this week, not so much. The biggest problem I had with this video was the stabilizing effect, that your walls were moving all the time. It was very distracting and didn't allow me a real chance to look at you perform. The parts I did notice were okay but I would urge you.. if you're going to do a song and performance like this, really commit to the emotional part of it.  GWMW: Your butt reminded me of The Oblongs, so props for that. I loved your concept a lot (it was very clever) but the execution wasn't there for me. I think you were a bit too far back in the performance and you weren't the focus, the props were. I think if you started up close, and moved back for your reveal, it could have made the video better.  Edie: N/A Gloria: I loved how the video looked in black and white. I wish you kept it like that a while longer before going into color. My concern for this video was that it did not give me the exuberance the song is asking for. This song is about being out and proud and going for it and I didn't feel that from you.  Pierre: Pierre, I think this was not your best video. If the song is called Hips Don't Lie, you should have showed us shaking your hips!  Ko Rook: I loved this so much. Simple. Smart. Your use of the second screen was perfect. Toots GAWD.  Hannah: Hannah, this week you really turned things around. You were engaging, confident, you committed, it was entertaining, your sync was good.. all elements of a great lip sync video. This was reminiscent of Shutt_Up's audition video and that is high praise from me. Congratulations, this was a killer video and one of my favorites this week."

Gloria, I'm gagging on your Born This Way beauty as always.  You gave the energy and movements I'd expect from the song, and your boy/drag self combination was very cool!  Pierre, you pick songs that you can absolutely destroy in the best ways.  I loved the look, the lipsync was perfect, and you're going to go far!  Ko Rook, I wasn't sure if I was a fan at the start of this competition.  But this week, you picked a song I cannot stand...and I could not stop watching your video.  The split screen was a great effect, and you're giving off that rapper vibe completely.  I cannot WAIT to see what you do next!  Schtick, I want to see your dad on LSFYL Season 4.  You really pulled it out today, and even though the sync was a bit shakey, your brilliant use of props, schtick, and your father brought you to the top of the charts!  Well done.  Dazey, I'm so sad to see you go.  I really think you were a serious contender for the top, but things happen.  Keep performing, you're a star.  And Edie, good luck uploading your video!  I would hate to see you go.  Stop making voting so difficult, guys.  Good luck to everyone!"

That day I was feeling pretty dark on the competition because of the news of the recent shifty vote getting.

LSFYL,3bh0lf,msgloriaswansong,2,Wed Jul 1 17:57:28 2015 UTC,"Critiques of the Week  viqule You seem to be caught in a situation I found myself in back in season 1. I feel like I'm not seeing enough variation in facial expression even if the songs have vastly different themes, it appears to be the same however many movements, every video. However other than that you had a good concept, excellent use of props, just be aware that's not going to carry you all the way through.  LSunday I'm super happy to see a straight sync from you, however as much as I get you were playing a slurry drunk white girl, you need to enunciate better on some of the words, in between choruses it seems like the words are just sort of rushing by you. It also read like you weren't very comfortable doing this in some of the dancing. Drunk girls give 0 fucks, let loose. I still very much enjoyed your video.  axelknight0717 This video entirely didn't need a filter. It seems whenever you can't act out a lyric you don't exactly know what to do with yourself. Just feel it out, you don't have to act out every lyric. Also if you're not going to use the fan get rid of it, it doesn't need to be there if there isn't a use for the long stretches. ""Too Hot"" GODDAMN, THERE GOES THE FAN OFF THE SIDE OF THE SCREEN BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE A USE FOR IT AFTER THE LAST ONE. Y'know?   thelettergii I can't tell if the lighting thing was intentional because if it was then goddamn you're good at planning this shit out. You could definitely tell that you were feeling everything in the song. My only real critique is the subtitle where you got yelled at, maybe have that as an annotation or something on the youtube video rather than overlayed onto your video, because i wouldn't have been able to tell if you hadn't pointed it out. Very good job.  Calypso Overkill These stationary slow syncs are extremely hard to pull off. While you nailed every lyric and were definitely feeling it I sort of found myself tuning out a bit. It's not your best video, definitely not even close to bad but you've set a very high bar for yourself already. It feels very ""safe""  girlswhatsmyweakness I really really loved the concept, the energy seemed a bit tame for the first half of the song but once you came into the foreground you knocked it out of the park. Being super far away during a sync can kill a video but you managed to bring the energy back just in time to save it and really have something good. Just keep that in mind for future videos.  msgloriaswansong You got a little something on your face, all jokes aside this was a great lipsync. You hit every emotion and move, the only thing that took me out of it was the headphones but I'm assuming there was a reason for that. Really fantastic job this week.  pierrecruz if you're gonna do a song about hips not lying you might wanna have your hips visible. For the most part the sync was on point but there was that moment towards the end where you started dropping lyrics and then missed one entirely and just smiled at the camera. If that happens you need to refilm the video over because ""safes"" only last for so long.  Ko Rook This video makes me realize you look like one of the dudes from Pentatonix. Your sync was on point, your energy fit your song perfect. Not sure if the inbox sync for the daft punk sample was necessary but it didn't take away from your video which is an extremely good thing. Great Job.  holyshtick You my girl, finally got all of your concepts to come together with your performance and you KNOCKED IT OUT OF THE PARK. Great job, keep up this momentum! Also you getting your dad involved was FABULOUS."

Excellent job!  Edie Centric - Absolutely impressed. So glad you got your video in.  Holyshtick Brilliant. Love your dad fumbling with the glasses! You really got the feel of the song down and represented that through your video.  Calypso Overkill Definitely on point with your lip syncing. Great song choice."
LSFYL,3bh0lf,theGstandsforGabriel,3,Wed Jul 1 22:40:40 2015 UTC,"I think the comments about Edie being late vs. Gigi being late is kind of rude and almost insulting. Both of these girls are/were very strong competitors, but seeing some people give overwhelming support to Edie while the same people were giving Gigi crap last week for being late and still submitting a video are appalling.   Keep in mind that I LOVE Edie, she knows this, she knows I'm very supportive of her and have been very consistent in that, but you cannot call for the elimination of one contestant one week for being late and submitting a video, then next week when a different contestants is late with no video is being praised and people are still asking her to vote for her is wrong, wrong, wrong.   Is it really sad that Edie hasn't been able to submit? Yes, incredibly. In fact, she was in my top 3 in my mind. But you can't bend and change your opinion on late videos because you like a contestant. That's not how it works, or at least, not how it should work because that is not fair to the other contestants.  Vote for the people who submitted and support them, please.  That's just my opinion. Again, all love to Edie, you are beautiful and so incredibly talented <3"
LSFYL,3bh0lf,heychrisk,8,Mon Jun 29 23:27:56 2015 UTC,"Joan has the authority here. If she decides to accept a late video from Edie, then I have no choice but to accept that decision. The rules are clear that she gets the executive (realness) decision in these matters. I don't envy her having to make that choice.  But the rest of us still have to decide how to approach this. Some of us might want to feel like we're being fair to a strong competitor from whom we'd like to see more. I know I want to see more and don't want somebody getting sent home on a technicality when the competition is already so fierce. However, having been through this competition myself and having felt what it is like to give your all and sometimes get nothing in exchange but animosity and negative criticism, my heart goes out to the competitors who have put themselves out there asking you for another chance. They are the ones who showed up, and technical issues aside, that has to count for something.  Most of us who are voting aren't in the game. But imagine if you were, and think of what it might feel like to know that somebody's debating whether or not you deserve to stick around one more week because the're waiting on one other person. You know you'd feel bad about that, like maybe you aren't even a full part of the competition, and that maybe all the work you've put in isn't worth as much as the work somebody else put in.  I don't want to tell anybody how or when to vote. But to me this competition lives and dies with the community, and I'd like for us all to remember that these aren't just strangers competing, but our good friends, and that we should try our best to treat them all as such."
LSFYL,3bh0lf,Raven_Night,8,Tue Jun 30 00:25:10 2015 UTC,"In Season 1, I was in Edie's position. In Season 2, I was in Joan's position. Now, in Season 3, I am one of the people at whom you are leveling this critique. Given that I have had the opportunity to experience all sides of this issue, I feel compelled to offer my response.  When I competed in the first season, I knew that I would be away for a week and would be unable to film a video. I immediately contacted Dixie to work out a plan so that I could remain part of the competition. Together, we made it happen. Edie knew she would be gone and warned Joan in advance; Joan was thus able to figure something out with her. Gigi, on the other hand, missed the submission deadline twice without any warning. I know how hard it is to get videos made and I don't think she was doing a terrible job in the competition, but her struggle with time management was, to my mind, not comparable to Edie's lack of internet access.   That said, Edie is fast approaching the extended deadline herself, and it seems likely that she will be penalized as a result. Such is life."
LSFYL,3bh0lf,heychrisk,5,Tue Jun 30 00:29:32 2015 UTC,"It's not just you, Ariel. Trust me, there are others who we're saying the same things you were, even if you meant yours jokingly. It also doesn't help that main people consider your advise and critiques in high regard.  And while some people are able to give a warning, things come up, life happens, and we can't be the ones to judge and say ""SHE deserves to be disqualified but SHE deserves to stay."" For all we know, Gigi could've lost her internet or her video footage got messed up. We don't know."
LSFYL,3bh0lf,starlightzone,4,Tue Jun 30 00:40:17 2015 UTC,"We only know what Joan has relayed to us. I have to assume that if Gigi's lateness occurred through no fault of her own, that we would have been informed, just as we were with Edie's submission this week.  And for the record, I wasn't really joking with my ""Vote for Edie"" campaign. I voted for her this week. I think her previous work shows that she has more to offer this competition than some of the other contestants, lack of internet connection notwithstanding."

And I couldn't think of two people more deserving this week than Calypso and PIERREEEEEEE I AM SO PROUD OF YOU! I am so sad to see Gigi and Luna go, you two were some of the strongest competitors in my eyes and it blows my mind that this happened. Please stick around and Carrion.  Also, Joan, you are extremely nice just to give a warning, especially after the same thing happened last season. Whoever it was, it's one thing to promote the competition to others and spread the word about LSFYL, but it's another thing when you're ruining the integrity of the competition by telling people exactly who to vote for. People have worked their asses off on their videos, and IMO it's extremely disrespectful for you to try and manipulate the votes in your favor.

Given the song choice, I can forgive this being a bed sync because it ties in with the song, so that's fine. My biggest concern is that you made a sex joke, which I'm all for 100%, but it just felt out of place here because it was a very sweet sync and to raunch it up a bit felt disconnected. Also this is just an editing thing, make sure to cut out the part where you stop recording your sync, it's very small and nit picky, but it'll do wonders to your sync's overall presentation.

I'm proud of you. The look is on point, you never dropped a lyric, and you held character.  If you want a little constructive critique, I'd recommend finding ways to incorporate stillness into your performance. When I started, I was always walking back and forth, back and forth, and I realized that it came from nerves. I see videos of me now and I'm like, ""GIRL STAND STILL FOR A SECOND."" By planting your feet in one place for a couple lines and just serving some facial expressions and small hand gestures, you  change the pace and add another dimension to your performance. Then maybe take a couple slow steps, or dance in place a little, then hold still again. Then walk. Then dance in place. Change it up! At first, it will feel REALLY awkward. Like, ""shit, I'm just standing here not doing anything."" But if you're really selling the sync, I promise that the audience will keep watching, and in the long run it'll help you feel even more confident in your performing abilities."

It's good to hear different points of view, and (from what you've given me so far, at least) I feel like I can actually grow and deliver something better for you next week. You a bae. x"

I need to figure out how to match the energy of a song! Since I'm a natural 22 in a 1-10 scale! ...Ariel said I should stick to #DivaEnergy since that's what I'm good at...but how can I show versatility with the same energy?

It isn't fair to your peers who got their videos in on time which is a vital part of this competition. If you receive enough votes to continue to next week, it wouldn't hurt to prove to everyone that you can be fierce and on time. The early bird slays the worm."
LSFYL,39vln4,calypsooverkill,6,Mon Jun 15 21:57:13 2015 UTC,"Season 3! Colors Week! I know getting into the this season wasn't an easy feat and the way I see it: if you got in, you deserved it. I also know making these videos are equal parts fun and frustrating, so your work is appreciated by the community. Now.. on to the critiques.    LSunday: The effort in this video is remarkable. You didn't just lip sync this video once, you did it at least three times. It's evident you really want this and I see that. I think this is a step up from your audition video, which I personally found overproduced and was less about the sync. This was entertaining. I want to see you deliver something basic eventually, because I don't want your production to be a crutch later on.  Gloria Swansong: Your look was remarkable and it was really great to see. I like that you're delivering something different in this video compared to what was offered in your intro and audition. My advice for you would be experimenting with different syncing styless. Let your lips quiver during certain notes. Sync your lips with more emphasis while you're humming, otherwise it just looks like your mouth is closed.  Luna Rox: The first thing I thought, after seeing your video, is that you know how to sync very, very well. It was tight as hell and that's impressive. I think you have what it takes to make it further in this competition but it won't be if you have the camera up tight like that for every video. I think experimenting with camera angles and lighting will only serve to do you well. Dazey Mayhem: I absolutely loved this video. The performance, the song choice, the sync -- top notch stuff. I don't have any advice for you because this, for me, was flawless. You gave us little moments in this video that people will remember. Your slurred speech, your reaction when the male vocals came up? Great stuff. I think others should take note - those little moments can make a video.  Edie Centric: What I like about you already is that I don't know what to expect from you. If someone asked me what color song would Edie do, I would have assumed a jazz standard or a showtune. Always keep us on our toes! Your sync and your adorable 'friend' in this video were just a great choice for you this week. I can't wait to see what you have in store for us. Kudos. Pierre: Pierre, yours was the only video from this week that I actually sang along with. Your energy is infectious and your sync is tight. I think you should plan other things you can do in your sync, to bring more of a concept. Overall, this was a great video and I'm glad you made it in.  Ko Rook: The beginning of your video was probably my favorite. You walked in, people were left guessing and then boom: your reveal. This song was a little bold because a lot of us relate it to Jujubee's performance on Drag Race.. but it didn't matter. You brought your own take to the song, you were sultry and it worked. I would just recommend making sure of your lighting next time and to commit to the end of your lines, sustain those notes. Sometimes you didn't enunciate those lingering notes and I think that would give your videos an extra kick.  Calypso: This was better than your audition! Your moves were energetic but they already feel much more controlled. I'm glad to see that. Perhaps some of the reason for that is because your camera was tight on you. However, it didn't leave a lot of room to move around. I know you said you like to dance so next time you decide to do that, give us enough space to see you move around and work it! Good job here.  thelettergii: I really liked how well the concept worked with the song. The sync was tight and I enjoyed the performance. My favorite part was the crescendo at the end because it was a good build up -- you break from the restraints, you reveal your sharp disco-ball shirt, you started posing fierce -- loved that. I wish the camera quality was just a tiny bit better so I could see your makeup even more clearly! I also would have loved to see reflecting off that shirt! Give us that flare! Very solid video.  girlswhatsmyweakness: You are definitely thinking outside of the box when creating your visual concepts and I'm all for that. It was a very out-there look and I can appreciate that. My concern is that it didn't really match the tone of the song. You looked like a villain from a 1930's film to me -- which I really liked -- but it didn't go with this. My personal advice for you would to be to switch up your song choices. I appreciated the scatting portion but I think it went a little too long in this video. I didn't feel as engaged during that part. With that said, I really liked your video and I like what you are bringing to the competition.  holyschtick: The moments when you displayed emotions in your performance, I was right there with you. You emoted a bit in this video and that's important in a sync. My concern for you is that I didn't feel the kind of ""punch"" in your performance that the vocals were giving me. I would also suggest giving us just a little more of a concept next time! The competition is steep here and people are pulling out all the stops Billy Darling: Your videos are rad. There's a tongue-in-cheek kind of fun that I enjoy in your syncs. With that said, I want you to change things up. This video was a lot like your audition video, and I see your strengths there, but give us a a full song. Change the scenery.  Do your video from a different position. Things like that would go a long way, I think.  AxelKnight: This song is nothing I would have expected from you, Axel -- and that's great. You're really challenging yourself and trying something new and it's being noticed. The advice I want to give you is something Latrice said on the show once: understand where the song is coming from and then deliver that. You did well and please, keep pushing yourself.  Viqule: I loved everything about this video - the look, the sync, the background, the general visual aesthetic- except your song. I absolutely hated it and I think that was also a problem for people in your audition video as well. Your effort is undeniable. You enjoy making video and that shows. Choose songs that you think would get people hype. It's ok to pander just a little.  Gigi Spot: You looked beautiful. Your performance was great. As you noticed, your overlay wasn't right and that was very distracting. I can tell you were rushing your video in and I think everyone else can tell you: time management is important. With that said, I am going to vote you this week because I think you have a lot of potential and you have more to offer in this competition. I wish you luck."

LSFYL,39vln4,korook,7,Mon Jun 15 15:31:38 2015 UTC,"Heeere's Claudia! I'm so sorry, once again I am horrible at criticism, constructive or otherwise, but I will try my best to say something I liked about each of your videos!  LSunday - I admit, I very quickly fast-forward through the theme when I binge watch OITNB. The song is such an earworm! That being said, I enjoyed your commitment to three characters! But I'm sensing a pattern, and it's a little distracting. I hope to see just YOU in a future video.  msgloriaswansong - Miss Gloria! I had nearly forgotten about this song, and was so excited to see that you'd chosen it! It suits you quite nicely. Wasn't entirely sure where you were going with the headdress, but you looked beautiful regardless.  Luna Rox - Never heard this song before, and I quite liked it! Very catchy! And of course, your look is inspired. My only...request?...idk if that's the word I'm looking for (probably not) is in versatility...so far what I've seen your song choices are very emotionally charged and high energy. Do you do ballads? Folk tunes? I'd love to see it sometime!  Dazey Mayhem I almost did this as my Carrion song! How embarrassing that would have been for me! Augh! I am a huge HUGE fan of Amy, and was very excited to see what you made of this song. And while I admit I am not personally a fan of the drunk characture (not your fault of course)  that many people have reduced Amy to, I did not let it cloud my viewing of your sync! You slayed Amy's slurred vocals, which people really oughta give credit to you for, because I imagine it's much more difficult to decipher the vocals this way.  Edie Centric - I was very surprised by your choice, but in a good way! I think your concept was well planned and executed, and your assistant was very cute (and on point too!)  Pierre Cruz - Pierre I loved the song choice! I always feel so energized and excited after watching your syncs. I guess my ""critique"" would be similar to Luna's in that I'd like to see you do a song with a little more low-key energy?  Ko Rook - oh my Lord. Love this song, love you. You definitely took a risk doing a Drag Race favorite (and if I remember correctly a song done in this LSFYL competition in a past season) but you killed it. If you don't do ""Devil In Disguise"" next week I swear to gods...I will still love you.   Calypso Overkill - Not going to lie, I wasn't really sure how I felt about you from your audition video. Liked your song choice, but wasn't really one way or the other. Jesus, I feel so mean omg But this one turned it for me! You were feelin' the fantasy and I was right there with ya! Keep it up, I would love to see more from you!  thelettergii - I seriously didn't even realize your hands were bound at first, that is how mesmerized by your eyes I was! You had me in a trance! The song choice was unexpected too, but I enjoyed! Keep up the good work!  girlswhatsmyweakness I was wondering what you'd do this week, I have come to expect a well-formed concept from you. And of course you delivered. I hope that doesn't hurt you in the future though, that you are able remain consistent. Because I really do enjoy seeing what you'll do next!  holyschtick - I think this was a very solid sync, not something I would have expected from you (if you ever do ""Purple People Eater"" I'd love to see it! I think you'd slay!) but the concept was a little light, especially compared to your audition.   Billy Darling - We...want...Billlly! You're a star, kid! I was so excited to see what you came up with, if you'd do spoken word again. It seems you've been critiqued for not showing versatility, but I disagree! I think your mash-up skills spanning many genres are amazing!   axelknight0717 I am glad to see you challenging yourself, the song choice isn't your usual is it? I wasn't a huge fan of your paper props, but they were a good way to foray into trying new things! Good for you!   viqule Another song I'd never heard but was very into, quite the departure from your audition! I enjoyed the over-all concept and look, and I think you did very very well. Can't wait to see what you come up with next! I have a feeling next weeks theme will treat you very well!  Gigi Spot You looked STUNNING! Absolutely stunning, I can tell you worked very hard on your look and concept. And I did see your improved overlay, but it is a very important aspect of this competition. Hopefully it doesn't affect your votes too much, because I would love to see what you come up with.  I am sorry these ""critiques"" are all terrible and unhelpful, but thank you all so much for entertaining me! I am very excited for next weeks theme! The grocery store I work in plays a Pandora station that seems to start in the 50s and work it's way through the decades musically as the day goes on. And as I've been hearing songs, I've been thinking who they would be perfect for!"

Amy was not on my radar before choosing this song, so I had no reference as to what she was supposed to be saying - much less making it look like I was saying whatever it was! Much easier said than done!  Sorry to lambaste one of your faves, but it was done in good fun - no malicious intent at all! I really didn't know much about her until I began preparing this."

Way to come out fighting and proving you earned your Shangie Status.   I don't really have any nitpicks - and that's all they'd be. Everyone is so damned good you make me nervous as all hell every week.   And /u/thelettergii - I may have to start checking in with you - this makes at least the second, but I think the third song we've both veered toward. So glad you took this one, too. Brilliant.  Kudos to everyone. I'm really not trying to be Miss Congeniality and pansy out of critiquing, but with a group as strong and diverse as this, I find a hard time faulting anyone this early in the game.

LSunday: Green Screen Queen? More like THREE Screen Queen. Amiright ladiessssss? Wink wonk.  Rewatching your lipsync, I enjoyed it. You always give good energy and character when needed. You PERFORM, which I respect. I just didn't feel as though the song choice held up, tbh. Also, as cool as the multiple characters were, and while I can appreciate it from an artistic standpoint, the challenge of conveying a tight sync was lost on me with three mouths moving differently. But, maybe that's just me! Here's wishing you luck next week x  msgloriaswansong: COLOR. WOW. Talk about an eye-catching way to start off. Now, your look was so strong, I was hoping for an equally strong performance ... and I got it! The song might have been a little hard to keep interesting, and it got a little weedy by the end, but you served the sweet emotion of it well. When (not if, when) you get through, I would suggest trying something that would require some more energy - just so we can see what you can do! Gimme life from those eyes, not just your lips, you know? x  Luna Rox: I said it at the watch party, and I'll say it again:You're giving me a S3 Sigourney_Weaver and I LIVE. Such a strong syncer, and I really think the one to beat in the mouth department. I have no criticism? No, no I don't think so. I liked it all. xo  Dazey_Mayhem: Me and my girlfriend were watching the stream together and we could NOT stop laughing when we got to yours. I was legitimately entertained the entire time, and it was a WHOLE lotta Winehouse Wino mumbling (god rest her bless-ed soul, amen), but you served it up. Other than constructive crit. (because the sync with that song was near flawless), I'm gonna say that I want to see you project some intense emotion into your next song. Love you, dearly. x  Edie Centric: Why are you so captivating, like Felicia, girl, bye. You made a Frank Zappa song interesting for me, and that takes a little something something. Your sync was tight, your moves were right, and your dog... well, I liked him. The whole thing was cute, and I'm excited to see what you'll bring next week! I hope it's Elvis... x  pierrecruz: You are such high energy and I both respect and envy you because of that. I could never bop around and be as mesmerizing as you, girl, how?? It just isn't fair - it looks like everything comes so natural. The only thing I have to say about that, though, is: don't let the choreography outshine the sync. You always, literally, dance the line when it comes to that - at least for me. Needless to say, loved you this week, wish you all the luck with next week's theme!  Ko Rook: Tuck ur tits better naixt time duche nozal.  Calypso Overkill: This whole performance was so strong, I was blown away by it. Honestly, it was even so much better than your audition! It had direction and thought and was well acted AS WELL AS synced. I lived. Just continue doing what you're doing and everyone (including me) is going to love it. x  thelettergii: You had a lot to live up to after that audition video, and I think you brought a really strong concept and execution to the song. While I didn't think it was the best song choice at first, you delivered and shut me up. OH and I can't forget to mention and compliment the look! Mine and the gf's favourite parts were your eyes - gorgeous. We also had a fight about wether or not titanium was ACTUALLY a color, but no worries, I lost (as always). I'm so excited to see what you do next week and I hope I see some more high energy! You're one to beat, love x  girlswhatsmyweakness: Your weakness is Michaels Craft store, girl. I kid. But no, seriously.. the look was a little over-the-top for me and took away from an overall good sync. And I can dig some scatting Ella, too! You nailed that and gave amazing # mouth: love, love, love. I respect the character creation, but maybe a little less with the whole 'creation' aspect of it? You have great performance instincts and I want to be able to appreciate them fully without having to fight with a distracting aesthetic. I don't even mind if you keep your shirt off - fuck the anti-nudists. x  holyschtick: You're so fucking cute, and you gave me good emotion - I can appreciate that. My only qualm is your song choice. While I was thrown back into a wonderful tailspin of nostalgia for 'El Dorado', the song was just not lipsync material. Keep length, repetitiveness, and overall mood in mind when picking your next one, and I think you'll do great! Another one with good instincts. x   Billy Darling: You ain't gonna be this subs darling for long if you keep doing 6 minute videos, girl. That said, the sync was tight in most places, sometimes lacking in others, but overall pretty good! I just wasn't really blown away because it was a lot like your audition video. I want to see something different from you - maybe a full song? shade noise Excite and surprise me and the rest of the people that actually matter! x  axelknight0717: YAY. You surprised me with your song choice and you didn't have too much arm choreography and I loved it! The only thing you lacked, which I, personally, am really big on, is the emotion behind the performance. You were a little whispy where the song called for heaviness, but, all-in-all, I still enjoyed it, and I think a lot of people will too. Good luck with this week's theme! x  viqule: Oh God, I hated the song. And I hated that I hated it, because the look was fascinating, and you seem really dedicated to your craft. It was just the poor LS song choice that nailed you. Other than the brilliance of the look, I think your saving grace is going to be that you gave good mouth - that's what this competition is about in the end anyway. x  Gigi Spot: Ah, the damned overlay - girllll, that really was a rough spot. In all seriousness though, Gigi, I don't think the off-sync is going to hurt you this week. Anyone with eyes could see the performance was there, the emotion was there, the look, and the sync (would have been) tight af. If I could offer up a piece of small advice, your trouble could have been the title card at the beginning. If you're in IMovie on a macbook, sometimes inserting it does weird things where it will grab and move audio. I've dealt with it once or twice before. Alternately, if you're having trouble syncing all the time, do a visually or verbally cued countdown - always works for me. I'm sure this was just a one off thing because last week you were solid. I wish you all the luck in the world with the next theme, love! xo  This week AGAIN I'm going to have trouble voting. GDI."

LSFYL,39grco,dazeymayhem,2,Fri Jun 12 15:27:53 2015 UTC,Earlier in the week! Yikes! I didn't have a colourful song on my playlist so I had to learn one from scratch... May have bitten off more than I can chew..  Hope your filming goes well!!! Xx
LSFYL,39grco,EdieCentric,2,Fri Jun 12 22:40:41 2015 UTC,I'm sure yours is fab. I started early because I know myself and needed extra time to obsess over it and redo it 20 times. I didn't know my song either until I picked it - don't think I EVER want to hear it again now.
LSFYL,39grco,dazeymayhem,8,Sat Jun 13 22:47:56 2015 UTC,Best of luck to everyone. Remember to have fun this summer and kill every lipsync!

I wish you committed a bit more, though! The words seemed a little mumbled at times.  dipthonggirl: Solid performance and sync. Your partner really helped the story aspect of your video. Luna Rox: This blew me away, Luna. This was so very good. I'd be surprised if you didn't make it. Davis: Great performance and you have a distinct way of lip syncing. You really impressed me with this video and I think you have a great chance of making it.  Ko Rook: The intro was pretty good, just a tiny bit long. You synced not just the lyrics, but sounds from the vocals and that was a good touch.  morganawitch: You need to overlay. You had a good look and it looked like you were having fun.  LSunday: Production value was stronger than the sync. The production was very impressive, tho.  Michigeek: Fun performance. You used the props well. I wish there was better lighting and maybe a better camera angle so I could see your sync even better.  holyschtick: This was a big surprise, I really had fun watching this! It was nice to see a lip sync from someplace different.  Edie: You have the uncanny ability to look like you're actually saying the words. Flawless. I'm certain you'll make it in. PierreCruz: PIERRE! This was a lot of fun and your sync was tight. You put a smile on my face, pelamor.  Rasyndain: The effects were cool and they didn't overwhelm the sync. Good job on that. I would advise that you emote more in your next video.  MsGloriaSwansong: Your acting bits during the sync were enjoyable to watch. Props for having a different type of visual from others.  KHRoxas: Your energy definitely matched the song. Nice one! Axelknight0717: This was a fun sync and one of your best lip syncs so far, Axel.  Tommy Riot: You are here to compete and it shows. Very brazen performance that may serve you well.  Mysticala: Nice. Dazey Mayhem: Fantastic concept for an audition and all done in one take? This was great. I think you might make it in.  Nipule: This was a fun video with a lot of concept. Pretty darn nifty, Nips! It reminded me of a choreographed music video.  Raven_Night: I really liked the energy you were giving in this sync, Raven! thelettergii: This was phenomenal! I'd be so surprised if you didn't make it.  Skarlet: You did a really good job feeling the lyrics and emoting them while you performed. Be a little more focused and you can go far. I look forward to seeing more.  kioseth: You give good face. I particularly enjoyed this sync, Kioseth.  Calypso: Pretty good job, Calypso! I really like how you did your makeup.  GWMW: One of the highlights of the group for me. If you don't make it, I'd be surprised.  Rhonda Civic: Your suit was fresh to death, Rhonda! You're always entertaining with your lipsyncs.  rawkhawke: Your video probably made me smile more than any other. This was silly and fun.  BitchEva: EVA! Look at you work it out! Love this video and I tolerate you! superwonkyeyelash: Sam, you had a lot of energy but the sync was a little loose! alexlopez: This was something very different and honestly, I really enjoyed it. I'd be curious to see what you'd bring.  mtd1988: You owned this song. The attitude, the swagger, the tight sync. Fantastic. One of my favorites. I think you might make it in.  KyleVisage: Moochy, this was way more fun than I thought it would be. You surprised me, in a good way.  River: This song was beautiful. I wish I could have seen your lips more in the sync! It was hard to make out your mouth at times.  Alex Spears: There was no overlay and it really distracted me, I'm sorry.  Sheba Maneater: Same as Alex Spears, there was no overlay and I felt like it could have been just a little stronger.  Billy Darling: This was so damn good. I think it was smart that you added the vocal parts to the song. You remind me a bit of Season 2 competitor, /u/dorpanthera, and that's high praise.  Gigi Spot: You made a lip sync video in a bed and it wasn't bad! There's a weird superstition around these parts that a bed sync equals death, but you never lacked in energy. I really liked it.    TREND ALERT: FILMING IN PORTRAIT  If you'd like a further in-depth review, just ask! I'd be glad to help you out if I can."
LSFYL,38zk5a,AgentFear,5,Mon Jun 8 09:00:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, indeed. All in one take. I thought that was the rule?  Was much harder than I thought to get it down in one shot. I probably filmed for a good hour before I got something to work with and I was still unhappy with it - but that was the best one. It's tough! And the competition is unreal!"
LSFYL,38zk5a,dazeymayhem,3,Mon Jun 8 10:02:50 2015 UTC,"Well, most of the auditioners only did one song, so yes I imagine it was much harder than you thought. THUMBS UP."
LSFYL,38zk5a,starlightzone,4,Mon Jun 8 13:35:01 2015 UTC,Ha! Point taken. I couldn't decide...    And thank you!
LSFYL,38zk5a,dazeymayhem,4,Mon Jun 8 13:36:59 2015 UTC,YAY! I'm glad you liked my submission! Thanks for going through the whole thing - I know it was unreasonably long.
LSFYL,38zk5a,billydarling,4,Mon Jun 8 11:03:17 2015 UTC,"Naah it wasnt too long, yours was one of my fav :)"
LSFYL,38zk5a,Zoomyx,3,Mon Jun 8 12:37:46 2015 UTC,I really do like your video too. I was amazed caus your lipsync is really tight unlike your butthole. <3

LSFYL,38zk5a,BitchEva,3,Mon Jun 8 17:09:20 2015 UTC,"For you darling, the world.   I love your song choice. What I really like about your performance is that you committed yourself to acting out the song. You decided you were a heartbroken girl looking for answers and that came through. You also showed a confidence that I really enjoyed seeing. This is, hands down, my favorite video from you and your best one.  My concern with your video is that your performance didn't reach the right tone of the song. You were forlorn and I feel like the song sounds way fiercer. She's not asking for answers - she's demanding them. I would have liked if you were staring at the camera dead on, less heartbroken and maybe just a little bit angrier."
LSFYL,38zk5a,AgentFear,3,Mon Jun 8 18:59:02 2015 UTC,Thank you

LSFYL,38zk5a,AgentFear,4,Mon Jun 8 19:07:01 2015 UTC,"Entertaining is all I ever set out to be. I may film with a potato and can never seem to know my words, but #VoteRhonda and you'll get a fun show!"
LSFYL,38zk5a,RhondaOdyssey,5,Mon Jun 8 17:47:07 2015 UTC,Thanks! I appreciate the feedback. Still trying to figure out what these hookers want to see. I'll go full frontal if I have to!
LSFYL,38zk5a,Rasyndain,3,Mon Jun 8 22:00:05 2015 UTC,I was hoping to get critiqued more on my lipsync than my makeup but this pretty much tells me where I stand in the competition. Haha. Thank you very very much tho. :)
LSFYL,38zk5a,calypsooverkill,4,Mon Jun 8 09:12:54 2015 UTC,"I think you did a good job. There were some parts where the sync was a little off and that's okay. You had a lot of energy during the song, and that's great. However, there were times where it felt a little unfocused, like you were moving just because you should, instead of with a purpose.   It did seem like you were having fun during your sync and I think that's an important factor. Did you have fun making it?"
LSFYL,38zk5a,AgentFear,3,Mon Jun 8 09:26:05 2015 UTC,Well I actually did have fun doing this. Now that all videos are out I think the first one is the best choice. But anyway I asked for more critique to get better cause I know I have a long way to go so I appreciate it really merci.
LSFYL,38zk5a,calypsooverkill,3,Mon Jun 8 12:32:39 2015 UTC,kisses u many times.
LSFYL,38zk5a,korook,3,Mon Jun 8 16:18:22 2015 UTC,I dont really know what to take from this compared to all other comments. Read me? I'm feeling lost ><
LSFYL,38zk5a,xXMysticalaXx,3,Mon Jun 8 18:21:25 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your kind words, Tempest. x"
LSFYL,38zk5a,Luna_Rox,3,Mon Jun 8 19:09:21 2015 UTC,I'd love some more in-depth critique if possible! And I totally get what you mean about the focus. I was a little all over the place.
LSFYL,38zk5a,Vibr8_,3,Mon Jun 8 19:49:22 2015 UTC,"Of course!   I like that you were dragged up and you looked good. I'm no drag queen but the more practice you do with makeup, it'll be even better. I really liked the camera angle because it showed exactly what I wanted to see. You weren't boring with your performance, you were moving around and making it fun. Your effort was palpable.  I'm glad you understand what I mean about having focus. Every time you moved closer to the camera, you gave ""crazy eyes"" and I know it's because you were partly nervous and partly thinking 'I'm not going to fuck this up!'. My advice would be to relax a bit before you film your sync. Don't get in your head about being better than someone else (which is odd to say in a competition), but instead just have fun with it. I think it'll improve the quality of your video."
LSFYL,38zk5a,AgentFear,3,Mon Jun 8 20:21:55 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  I know what you mean about the moving-closer-to-the-camera thing. I have to correct that in the future.  I need to focus on doing as well as I can, regardless of the competition. Not on just being better than the others."
LSFYL,38zk5a,Vibr8_,3,Mon Jun 8 20:25:39 2015 UTC,I've been wanting to make this video for AGES and I'm thankful for a boyfriend who'll sit pretty for an afternoon.

LSFYL,38zk5a,RhondaOdyssey,2,Mon Jun 8 19:35:39 2015 UTC,"I love this, please continue to do them. Rhonda! Rhonda Rhonda Rhonda! I love you too! Thank you for your kind words!"
LSFYL,38zk5a,mtd1988,11,Tue Jun 9 04:32:19 2015 UTC,"I hadn't planned on doing this, but what the hell. FULL REVIEWS. (Bear in mind that I have no decision-making authority here; my opinions on the Top 13 have nothing to do with who will be chosen.)  wenceslasbelli: You've got solid energy. You've clearly planned out fun hand motions and facial expressions for key parts of the song, but between those, there's maybe not enough connective tissue. What's missing for me is a consistent characterization to hold the whole thing together. So I enjoyed parts of this, but it didn't cohere all the way for me.  dipthonggirl: This really took off once you got your costar out of the way. I think if you had just sung this whole thing directly to the camera, you'd have done wonderfully, but instead you took away half your performing space and spent the whole time looking sideways. It was a cute gimmick to bring someone else in, but someone who's not doing anything is just dragging you down. I suspect that this concept was something of a crutch to avoid being alone. Next time, I want to see you standing by yourself, looking right at us, because the final chorus of this submission proved that you can do it.  Luna Rox: Full concept, full look, dead-on lip sync. I'm hopeful that I'll be seeing you in the Top 13.  Davis: I liked this video; it was confident. I'm not 100% sure if you were going for true drama or sort of comedic melodrama, and the sync had a few accuracy issues, but it was a solid first entry and I respect it.  Ko Rook: Your look and characterization are on point. I was engaged because of the clarity of your choices. You have great facial expressions and body language, and those are every bit as important as a tight sync. It's always tough to portray a straight dude because they are stereotypically more limited in their physicality, and that will be something for you to think about as the competition moves forward, but my ideal 13 has you in it for sure.  morganawitch: This was perfectly fine for me. Good sync, good look. If you continue on, the technical details are going to be important. Find a way to mount your camera on something so it doesn't move. Get more light on you. And if you're going to keep your feet planted in one spot, get a little closer so we can see more of what your face is doing. I wasn't blown away, but it was a solid entry.  LSunday: I like this concept and I think you performed it well. The ghostly visions circling you made for a nice image, but there were times when the two people standing next to you were just distractions. Make sure the editing is working for you and not against you. Nonetheless, I'd move you through to the Top 13. You carried that song without needing your costars.  Michigeek: This probably would have worked really well as a stage show. As a video, it started well, but I worry that it became repetitive. The song doesn't have a lot of variation, and so I wanted to see more diversity from your face and moves. The fan reveal was a nice touch, but I'll be honest that this left me wanting more.  holyschtick aka Hannah: I felt this. Your connection to the camera is fantastic; you're really delivering this as a full characterization and plot. On to the Top 13, my dear.  Edie Centric: And now we have a master class in how to sell a song. Everyone, watch and learn. If a picture is worth a thousand words, then this video is a whole series of epic novels. THIS IS HOW YOU TELL THE STORY. You go to the Top 13. You go directly to the Top 13, do not pass GO, do not collect $200.  pierrecruz: You have such an amazing amount of energy, and I can tell that you're having a great time. When you're having fun, I'm having fun. I sincerely hope I get to see more videos from you because they're wildly enjoyable.  Rasyndain: This was a good sync with a good concept. I think that, because it was so low-key, you may have trouble standing out in the crowd, but I appreciate that it was a thoughtful, well-executed submission.  msgloriaswansong: This was good. SPOT-ON look, solid sync. I'd love to see you take it to the next level in terms of performance. This was pretty subdued, and I think you could have been a lot broader with your characterization. You have room to go bigger next time.  KHRoxas: Completely rock-solid. Tight sync, engaged performance. I'm not blown away, it could have been a little more enthusiastic in parts, but you worked it out, I ain't mad at it.  axelknight0717: I found the filter distracting. If the performance isn't there, then no amount of color correction is going to put it there. That said: I think you actually sold this pretty well. This is the kind of song you should be doing more of; it plays to your strengths. I saw a little diva coming out of you. So more of this, but with less of that video manipulation.  Tommy Riot: I am rooting for you. You've grown so much. Your look is phenom and your intro was the kind of quirky insanity that I live for. That said: I need you to COME THROUGH. This, to me, is not a standing still song. I want you to come out of that shell and really work it. Even if you're not confident in a full-on dance, some movement would have helped this. Give me some swagger, some OOMPH. I know it's in there. I hope you make it to the next round so you can show it to us.  xXMysticalaXx: The choice to lip sync to multiple voices was ambitious, but it made things a bit muddled. It's tough to tell if the sync is accurate when five people are making mouth noises, you know? The lighting and camera placement work against you, too, so despite your enthusiasm and conviction, I think you're in the middle of the pack. I wouldn't be surprised if you made it through to the next round, but I couldn't guarantee it."
LSFYL,38zk5a,heychrisk,3,Tue Jun 9 02:53:03 2015 UTC,"Dazey Mayhem: Excellent concept excellently executed. On to the next round, my dear. This was a smart, smart entry, proving that you would have done very well last season and you have the potential to go far in this one.  viqule: Nicely done. Concept, props, tight sync, energy, emotion. The interpretation is a bit literal, but this is basically just what an audition should be. I know who you are and what you do, and you showed us that you're a good lip syncer.  Raven_Night: This is my kind of sync. I love a good faux belt. Like, there are riffs and high notes and you're just LIVING for them. You are a star taking center stage. I hope you make it through to the next round. HOWEVER: next time, clean up those details. I'm seeing a strap hanging off your dress, a computer screen lighting up the corner of your video, and some miscellaneous clutter in the background. A diva needs to set the stage.  thelettergii: It was tough not to be able to see your eyes, since so much storytelling happens through facial expression. That said, I was into the concept, and when you brought your hands in to add drama, it all came together beautifully. I know you're a fan favorite from before this even got started and I think we can look forward to some Top 13 action from you.  Skarlet Vainn: A totally solid offering. I would have liked a little more focus from you: I don't know how to describe it except to say that there were parts where the performance felt loose. But you're full of energy and you've got a look and I hope you're getting votes.  kioseth: This is a tough one. ""Fancy"" had a BIG moment, and everyone was doing this song for a while. So even though it's a good sync, the song choice made this feel a little tired for me. I've just seen it SO MUCH. I like your look. You could be more assured in front of the camera at times; when you look down, you seem too timid for a song that is explicitly about how fabulous you are. I think you'd do better with other material, but I do think you have the potential to deliver in the competition.  Calypso Overkill: A strong showing. The look was right, the sync was right, the background was clean, the energy stayed consistent throughout. I have zero problems with this.  girlswhatsmyweakness: The crazy thing is that even without the brilliant make-up job, this is a full SHOW. Miss Nina has many people living inside her, and you gave us that. The addition of some paint was icing on a delicious cake. Top 13 fo sho.  Rhonda Civic: This had all the right elements. Good costume, good energy, good sync, weird prop. I wanted to like this more than I did, though. I think it's the lighting and framing that kill it for me. We can't see you particularly well, so it ends up feeling like you accidentally left your webcam on, not like you intentionally made this to showcase your talents. I know that you're a killer lip syncer, so it's possible (probable, in fact) that I'm judging you more harshly, but this was only OK for me.  rawkhawke: This was cute. My concern is that it doesn't feel committed. You didn't seem confident in what you were doing. For these videos to work, you kind of have to throw yourself at them full-force. I didn't get the sense that you were all the way invested.  BitchEva: It was a decent sync, but there wasn't enough energy here for me.  superwonkyeyelash: You know the lyrics and you can move. To take this to the next level, you need to share with us. Your eyes are almost always down or off to the side, which makes it hard to really connect. It's important to direct your performance at the audience, which in this case is entirely the camera.   alexlopez: I enjoy that you got weird. For this to work ALL THE WAY, I think you needed to go further in actually portraying the craziness. You took it a lot of the way there, but there was a certain slackness about you that didn't complete the picture for me. This concept demanded a little more intensity than you gave, but I like that you thought about it and delivered something that was uniquely YOU.  mtd1988: Welcome to the Top 13. If there was a missed lyric in there, I sure as hell didn't catch it (save the one intentional skip on the echo of ""forget your name soon,"" which was smart). You might need to step up your game in terms of looks and concepts as the game progresses, but I can't imagine that this demonstration wouldn't get you a place on the list.  KyleVisage: This is a technically accurate sync, but for me you didn't bring enough in terms of performance. There's a lot of character to be milked out of a lyric like that, and I don't think you owned this like you could have.  River: I really want to critique your video, and I'm not trying to be shady, but I couldn't watch the whole thing with that strobe light going. I skipped around to try to get a good sample of what you delivered, and you seemed to be doing a fine job.  Alex Spears: You have all the elements in place. Great look, tight sync, fierce attitude. I'd love it if you kept a more consistent connection to your character and the camera. During the gaps in the lyrics, it sometimes seems like you're just waiting for the next line. You could brush up the technical aspects of the video, too. And watch for that dress slipping! But I'm clocking all that shit because I know you can turn this competition right out with those skills. I want you to rise to the top of your game, girl.  Sheba Maneater: I feel like I'm giving the same advice over and over, and I apologize for sounding like a broken record, but: this is a wonderful performance that is being partially obscured by technical elements. You planned this out start to finish with body language, props, setting, the whole nine yards, and it's a wonderful sync. BUT: the lighting is too dark, the camera is shaky and not centered on you, and I can hear all sorts of background noise because you didn't overlay your audio track. I hope you make it through so I can see you deliver a similar performance in a video that best showcases your talent.  Billy Darling: I would offer you praise but this killed me all the way dead. I am a corpse, typing this through lifeless fingers. My brain has stopped functioning, my heart no longer beats. SLAYED. Please bury me with a DVD copy of this video.  Gigi Spot: Damn. Am I watching a late '90s Mya video? This was the right way to close out the list of contestants. You're the Courtney Act of Season 3 for sure. That is some sex kitten REALNESS backed by a spectacular sync. (Next time, though, if you have to tuck your boob back into your bra, do a second take, don't just put it back and keep going. It was the one flaw in an otherwise ideal video.)"
LSFYL,38zk5a,heychrisk,3,Tue Jun 9 02:53:14 2015 UTC,"omg senpai noticed me  Um, I mean, holy shit, you have no idea how happy I am to hear you're looking forward to seeing more of me, seriously. Fun fact, I actually covered my eyes for two reasons: I have small eyes so it's hard to convey emotion, and I felt more comfortable lipsyncing without having to see anything. But these are both things I know I should probably work on and I hope I'll be able to do that this summer! Thank you so much."
LSFYL,38zk5a,thelettergii,3,Tue Jun 9 05:30:41 2015 UTC,AHHHHH! The feeling is mutual. SO PSYCHED that you enjoy my medley-based craziness. :D

LSFYL,38zk5a,EdieCentric,3,Tue Jun 9 04:06:59 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this meant a lot to read.  I put a lot of effort into putting everything together.  It's hard to perform in physical space that doesn't exist, and being told that I don't deserve to move on because I did that aspect of the performance well does hurt.  Thank you for the kind words, and I hope to see you all as a contestant this season, and not just a follower."

LSFYL,38zk5a,TommyRiot,8,Tue Jun 9 06:29:55 2015 UTC,Me at all of these
LSFYL,38zk5a,RhondaOdyssey,9,Mon Jun 8 06:35:24 2015 UTC,"I plan on doing FOR REAL reviews of all the videos once we've thinned the herd a little bit. For now, mama has some general wisdom for the hopefuls:  TECHNICAL DETAILS COUNT. Turn your phone sideways and record in landscape. Rehearse beforehand so you can be confident that your sync is down, your costume will stay on, and your props will work as expected. Make sure you're well lit and well framed. Take the extra few minutes to overlay the audio onto your video. Your background doesn't have to be a movie set, but it shouldn't pull the eye; at the very least, clean your room.  I'm not saying that everyone needs to be a green screen machine with a bunch of fancy filters and effects. But if these basics aren't covered, it can be extremely distracting. Don't let me notice how you need another lamp in the room, or that I can hear your feet shuffling because you didn't dub in the audio, or where I can see your wig falling off. It takes focus away from your performance. If you want this, want it enough to put some care into it.  THAT SAID: there are some real killers in this crowd, and I'm officially excited. Narrowing my list down to three votes will not be easy."
LSFYL,38zk5a,heychrisk,5,Mon Jun 8 06:14:20 2015 UTC,"I would like to open the discussion on this general LOATHING of portrait format...  What's the T on this portrait versus landscape debate?I think portrait serves some situations very well. For instance, if you want to show more of the body without the distraction of surrounding scenery. I guess I come at it from a visual art standpoint in that the format of the canvas should serve the image, not the other way around. If it serves the video why is it a bad thing?"
LSFYL,38zk5a,msgloriaswansong,6,Mon Jun 8 07:22:40 2015 UTC,"For me it's because Youtube and Vimeo and other video players are generally in landscape format, so when you upload a portrait video it's resized to fit in that frame and everything is smaller. So it's harder to see your lipsyncing and your faces, even if you set it to fullscreen. If Youtube was more accommodating towards portrait mode I would love to see more portrait videos, but with the way resizing is everything just feels cut off."
LSFYL,38zk5a,thelettergii,2,Mon Jun 8 07:33:43 2015 UTC,"Just chiming in to agree with the comments below. Your canvas has been chosen for you: I watch videos on a landscape monitor, using web players that are all set to landscape format. If you find a way to display big, full-resolution, natively portrait-oriented videos, then by all means, shoot that way. As it stands, a portrait movie uploaded to YouTube takes up only a third of the available playing space. The majority of the video is thus no video at all, just two black voids begging to be filled with creative ideas.   The format restricts you unnecessarily as a performer and limits your movement. For instance, in your submission, your elbow dips out of frame within the first ten seconds. It's not a huge deal, but it shows just how tight your playing space is. If you moved from that one place at any point during the song, you risked not being seen. In landscape, you would have had room to walk back and forth, gesture more broadly, and otherwise express yourself. Your video is actually a perfect example of why landscape is better for filming these lip syncs: this number from ""Grey Gardens"" is performed by a woman standing entirely alone on a gigantic Broadway stage, and she has to fill it all with her performance alone. If she can captivate the entire theater, then I want my competitors to at least fill the majority of my monitor with their performances."
LSFYL,38zk5a,heychrisk,3,Mon Jun 8 13:10:22 2015 UTC,Thanks for the thorough explanation! I sent the link to my sister who is a pretty amazing graphic designer and the first thing she said was never film in portrait again. Lol. Sooooo lesson learned there. That Christine Ebersol - oof she's amazing. Edie is a hard one because she's 1. done so well by several people and 2. not an incredibly energetic presence (save for her flag dance in the foyer). Thanks for the feedback.
LSFYL,38zk5a,msgloriaswansong,4,Mon Jun 8 23:04:35 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree with all of this, but I just wanted to mention that I talked to a few auditionees about the portrait vs landscape thing and it seems like a common issue is ""I did film in landscape but for some reason the phone/camera cropped it to portrait""? Hopefully someone knows how to solve this issue, I'm assuming it's mainly Apple devices and as an Android user I couldn't figure out how to solve it.   But just for this week I hope people don't fault the portrait users too much for that since it wasn't intentional! And I'm sure there were other bugs too with the other technical details that couldn't be helped."
LSFYL,38zk5a,thelettergii,6,Mon Jun 8 06:48:03 2015 UTC,"Lots of love to everyone for having the guts to audition!   Wenceslasbelli - Good start, but the sync could be a bit tighter. Great facial expressions tho!  Dipthonggirl - That's Me!  Luna Roxx - I thought you were going to cut yourself! That was the scariest part. Loved it!  Davis - 1 point for Marina, but there's something about your mouth movements that just seem...off. I lose you a couple times on the verses too.   Ko Rook - Love! But I get fidgety during long intros. Great Attitude!  Morganawitch - Are you a mermaid? Def need to overlay next time tho.   LSunday - So much production! Your look has improved, but it could use more energy. You're not out of the woods yet it seems.  Michigeek - Come Onnn Basement Set! (you and me both). Love how your costume was also props!  Holyschtick aka Hannah - I don't like the song. But that's not a legit critique :D I see I have competition for the best hair color.  Edie Centric - I hate you, because it's too perfect. -runs off to cry- I don't think I could ever do Babs like you.  pierrecruz - You're always a blast to watch.   Rasyndain - Ooooh we gots ourselves some SFX! I would have liked more energy, like when you had ALL the fire.   msgloriaswansong - You caught me at a good time. Just watched the Drew Barrymore/Jessica Lange Grey Gardens. I'm a sucker for revolutionary costumes!  KHRoxas - You always have a punchline at the end of your videos, which makes me want to watch them all the way through. Although this time you were able to carry it the whole time!  axelknight0717 - Probably my fav from you thusfar!  Tommy Riot - You're a lot more in control than last year's audition  xXMysticalaXx - You have my weakness, we both have a smaller mushy mouth, even if we know the lyrics. Practice enunciating into a mirror to see what shapes make a bigger visual impact.  Dazey Mayhem - Way to paint a target on yourself! It was hard enough to pick one song, and you go and do a million!  Viqule - I was not expecting costume changes on day one! Smooth! (oh, that's his other song...)  Raven_Night - Gurl! Tuck in your dress hanging ribbons! Otherwise great video :)  thelettergii - I hate you. Because I love you.   Skarlet Vainn - Please don't throw your frappachino on me  Kioseth - I like it, but I don't looove it. Your look is on fleek tho.  Calypso Overkill - Man I'm glad I didn't pick Marina this round. I love how droll you are when you pull back from the camera.   girlswhatsmyweakness - INTENSE.  Rhonda Civic - I want to know what you're doing with a large lipped banana. Living for the suit! I feel like the low video quality makes your mouth hard to see :c  rawkhawke - Cute! Weak start, but you get into it!  BitchEva - I feel your hair could have been bigger for this song.   superwonkyeyelash - You're def feeling your oats, but you gotta learn them words!  alexlopez - You're a bit unhinged, eh? Weird is good!  mtd1988 - Ugh you people and your rap skills. I gotta work on that. <3  KyleVisage - I'd call it cute if it wasn't so creepy!   River - The dark lighting doesn't work too well with a black lip, but I like your moves  Alex Spears - I'm sorry but the sound and verticalness was really distracting.   Sheba Maneater - MOAR BABS. I thought you did great, but the lack of overlay detracted from it.  Billy Darling - I'm always so impressed with remixes and spoken word.   Gigi Spot - Def the exception to the ""don't sync on your bed"" rule. You are very much feeling yourself! and I'm feeling it."

LSFYL,38zk5a,calypsooverkill,10,Tue Jun 9 08:53:38 2015 UTC,"Okay so I finally reviewed you all. Let me know if I missed anyone. And read me back. Critique would be appreciated!  Wenceslasbelli - very interesting song choice, at some points you were very on point but my real critique comes from two things, firstly you kept covering your mouth with your hands at certain parts making it difficult to follow. You also missed your entrance, the start was a little sloppy but you improved as you went further into the song,  Dipthonggirl - I love this song so much, you done very very well, but having an extra person on screen doing nothing was very distracting therefore I spent half of the time watching his movements and not the actual lipsync. P.s. I also love your hair!  Luna_rox - Very. very interesting, I didn't know what to expect the moment I saw the joker make up and the monologue. And bravo for lipsyncing spoken word. When you started the song, I got a little confused as your movements were quick and the same shape so it took me a little while to get back into following, but we'll done!  Davis - I live for this song and kudos for going for such a belter. On that note you were so hard to follow, you moved your face so much that following your lips at sometimes I didn't know whether you were accurate or not. However you were still fierce. Good luck.  Ko rook - this was stunning, only critique was how distracting the background was, however I still think you slayed, overall I preferred your lipsync to your monologue as your spoken word was a little...meh? At specific points but you killed the audition Good luck!!!  Morganawitch - I lived, I gagged. I love you and your look and the song choice. SLAY gurl, my literal only critique is you sometimes seemed to focused on remembering the woods which meant that your mouth shapes got muffled. Anyways I hope you get through! I'd love to see more.  Lsunday - I liked this, however I thought only one person was allowed to lipsync on the screen? The song and video aesthetics were cute but this feels a little bland due to the serenity of the song, however your energy matched the song.  Michigeek - this song this song this song! I love the choice, love the look, my only negative comment was that your arm movements were so distracting, you also covered your face occasionally. Needs a little work from the aspect of the recording but if this was live there wouldn't be as much of a problem, well done!  Hannah  - well done! This song style was difficult to pull off and I think you did it well. I like the mirror affect and your look was on point, continue to slay gurl.  Edie centric, You slayed, my Gawd. Keep it up I hope you will go far, your song choice movements and awareness on camera killed me. Only tweak I would make would be a change of lighting!  Pierrecruz - apart from the lighting and the fact that you lost me due to the amount of times you turned around and hasty movements. Your energy was great! You were fun to watch and enjoyed watching you enjoy yourself!  Rasyndain - I love the simplicity of this and the song, the concept was pretty cool and your lip movements were accurate, my only critique was that if felt like your energy didn't match the song. It did for the verses but you kept the same mannerisms for the chorus which energetic and louder, other than this I loved it, good luck!  Msgloriaswansong - this worked, people keep seeing portrait doesn't work but this did, it captured you in the right way avoided distraction, however, the video made it a little difficult to see your mouth move on the smaller movements. However this was different and you pulled it off well.  KHROXAS - I enjoyed this! Despite the fact that pitfalls voice grates on my ear I thought this was a decent lipsync, tracking your lips was a little difficult at some points but other than that well done.  Axelknight0717 - this wasn't my favourite but it was a strong lipsync, I love the song and you were pretty on point, you have a pretty big personality too. Hopefully see you in the next round.  Tommy riot - I liked this a lot. It was a very well done lipsync, however due to the song and the way it was presented I felt like you permanently made this permanent snarl which meant that you could have shown more energy maybe? Either way good luck!  xxmysticalaxx - yep give up now, you tried gurl. I will survive D: (vote mysticala ;))  Dazey Mayhem - oooooh gurllllllllll. This concept rocked. It was a way of showing your versatility, I dint have much critique really, keep up the amazing work, my only distraction was dat lip liner.  Viqule - being outside provides great lighting and your concept worked! This was a solid lipsync and I like the song choice, I wouldn't be surprised if you were in the next round, keep it up.  Raven_Night - CMON MAWMAWWWWWW. SLAY SLAY SLAY. Literally if the background wasn't so distracting this would be a potential top contender for me. Improve slightly because I am living for you,  Thelettergii - I'm sorry guys I have to say this..... WINNER. Gii you slayed and got that song stuck in my head since your audition was released, I also no longer watch the music video I watch your lipsync, I am more than rooting for you!!!!!!!!! Keep going!  Skarlet  vain - I love the song, I love the looks you killed it girl, I don't  really know how to critique you, keep it up your a star.  Kioseth - oooooh me like. Me like so much, you were accurate you looked great and your camera awareness was really really strong, looking fancy gurl, hope to see you again!   Calypso overkill - marina and the diamond is my Queen and this lipsync made me laugh so hard I did love it and I love your style, however I don't feel like your energy matched the song choice, I felt like you almost overkilled it haha :D but keep it up your fierce.  Girlswhatsmyweakness - okay, so, this was strong, your look and style matched but lipsyncing a song whilst ducking every other beat sorta throes you a bit, also lipsyncing from the side doesn't show the range of shapes you did when facing forward. However I do think this was one strong sync. Keep it up ok!  Rhondda civic - your energy was stunning, you also gave me a nostalgia throwback but the blur and movements made this more of a dance than a lipsync as it was so hard to follow.  Rawkhawke - oh Lord this song makes me cringe, you had great energy but it felt off, something felt like the overlay and the sync were slightly off as your mouth moves early, the moving around made me lose you sometimes.  Bitch Eva - I love this song and I felt like you fell a little flat, your energy didn't fully match the song, you have talent but I feel like it was more of an ""ok"" lipsync, I hope that if you get through you 'big it up' okay? Sorry >< I dint mean to be harsh but I think there was more you could have done.  SuperWonkyeyelash - this be ma jam! And blonde hair on top with short brown sides with the earring, bitch stole ma look. You're like my spirit animal if I could have a spirit animal. Idk. You rocked though, it wasn't the best but out of personal interest I wanna see more of you.  Alex Lopez - remind me to never bump into you in a dark alley. You are terrifying,interestingly horrifying song choice and your concept terrified me, I got chills. Your lipsync was solid but you were to close to the camera so occasionally your face went out of shot but good overall! Keep it up,  Mtd1988 - oooooh, I thought this was a very solid song, except for the fact that azaelia banks annoys the hell out of me so it was painful to listen to through the song but that ain't your fault just choose a better song ;) I don't think you have much to worry about as this was very solid, well done,  River - OK if it wasn't dark, there strobe wasn't too much and the background was tidier, this would have been my favourite, the drawback was the difficulty to see, please let me see you again next round and hopefully you take advice on board and slay!  Alex spears - the video and song worked, and you did do a good job overall, your look was on point but I don't know, I just didn't feel a spark I didn't feel like this was polished like your look was so stunning but it felt like you kept getting distracted and the frequent running back and forward put me off. However your lip action was really good.  Sheba maneater - OK, so negative first. You were to far away, there was no overlay so we could hear background noise and it's a risk to drink etc whilst lipsyncing because it means you can miss notes etc. However this was decent kudos for doing something different and having a theme so keep it up.  Billy darling - hmm, I was very impressed with your monologue at first the accuracy was on point, however some parts were accurate as hell and some felt a little off, you had a good concept though and I don't think you will have an problems getting through.  Gigi spot - your camera keeps blurring in and out. Whut. Personally I'm not a big fan of the song choice but the look and your energy matched, the lipsync was accurate and I think you were strong overall. Keep it up!  Kyle visage - okay what on earth was this song, I am mortified. Your lipsync is solid but you kept missing words, you also kept moving and playing with that piece of hair which was a massive distraction, as was the ladder next to you. You have a strong lipsync with good accuracy but you must consider your surroundings next time. Good luck!"

If you want a more in-depth critique from me just let me know and I'll be happy to nitpick!  (I also want to add a little to the technical details talk: with this many videos, the stakes are so high that every little detail matters and people are going to nitpick like crazy. But don't discount a video just because it lacks a detail either -- it's one thing to clock it because I will clock it too, and it's another thing to say ""Wow this doesn't have ___ so it sucks.""

This was a song that is very dancy, very fast-paced, and I think I was hoping for more movement from you. I could tell you were feeling the song, but it came off as low-energy because of the way you interpreted it. I LOVE your expressions at 2:26 though. I think your strength lies in slower, more emotional songs, and I think you should play to these strengths in later videos.   Also, work that crop toppppp"

LSFYL,38zk5a,Vibr8_,2,Mon Jun 8 18:41:01 2015 UTC,"Skarlet! So overall this was not bad, I really enjoyed your dryad realness. For me any nitpicks I have are a matter of personal taste on my part, like...you had a lot of energy in your movements and you were smiling a lot, while I interpret this as more of a serious song. Like, if I was lipsyncing this song, I probably would have moved around less and had more somber expressions -- but this is just my personal interpretation and it was interesting to see something a little different. In the future, though, I would like to see you try something with less arm movement and maybe something a little more serious, just for versatility? I felt like sometimes the moves were getting in the way of your lipsync.   I am not the best at makeup but I think if you can get ahold of lashes it will bump your look up by tons. Sometimes people paint their faces on Tinychat so feel free to take part in that whenever, because it's great practice imo! And I think a few thirsty folks would not be opposed to seeing you lipsync in boy drag sometime as well."
LSFYL,38zk5a,thelettergii,3,Mon Jun 8 19:00:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks Gii! I always took this song as the psycho-ex-girlfriend. The girl who sees love as a game, who is overly obsessed, and has the wicked mood swings. Hence my switching between crazy smiles and anger.  I'm definitely going to try to switch it up in the future (if I make it!) and show some more serious stuff. The hands, I totally agree with. I'm a hand talker, and it gets in the way.  I just ordered a bunch of new makeup, which includes a set of lashes! So my makeup game will definitely be better once all my new cosmetics come in. Right now my collection is really small.  Boy face will be happening! I just want to do it at the right times, with the right songs.  Thanks!"
LSFYL,38zk5a,Vibr8_,2,Mon Jun 8 19:48:03 2015 UTC,"Ohh, that makes sense! In that case I would have loved to see you take it even further. I think props would have come in handy here, maybe a photo of your poor ex or something.   I can't wait to see what you have planned!"
LSFYL,38zk5a,missgigispot,3,Mon Jun 8 19:57:41 2015 UTC,"I didn't want to seem like I was relying on props, especially in the first week. They probably would have really helped my performance though hahah.  If not in the competition, you will in the carrions!"

LSFYL,38zk5a,axelknight0717,2,Mon Jun 8 18:52:08 2015 UTC,"I should!   I loved this so much. You did the impossible by making a bed sync interesting -- usually people don't move around that much and it kills the energy, but you did exactly the opposite and I was LIVING for it. You were sexy, you were fierce, and you were even a little silly. I love your stockings and I especially love your look, I feel like you significantly improved since you last showed me a picture of yourself in drag! In the future I would love to see you do more fierce stuff, keep doing fierce, because you nail it and I want to see more drag from youuu! Definitely try playing with facial expressions too. Absolutely in my Top 14, my fellow G <3"
LSFYL,38zk5a,thelettergii,3,Mon Jun 8 19:10:52 2015 UTC,INeedSomeCritiques Cause I REALLY want to make it!
LSFYL,38zk5a,axelknight0717,2,Mon Jun 8 19:07:33 2015 UTC,"I think this would have been a standout audition if this was your very first video, because you nail all the words and you match the energy of the song. It's a simple lipsync but very enjoyable. However, because you've already done so many videos for the sub, this audition unfortunately doesn't have as much impact. It's mainly because most of your videos are just straight up performance lipsyncs like this, with similar movements, and this video was no exception. I would love to see some more diversity from you in the future, especially with concepts, lighting, whatever. A lot of these auditions have very strong concepts that are more than just lipsyncing, and I would love to see you do something like this!"
LSFYL,38zk5a,thelettergii,3,Mon Jun 8 19:41:02 2015 UTC,I had a feeling all those other Lip Syncs would come back to haunt me!
LSFYL,38zk5a,axelknight0717,2,Mon Jun 8 19:44:39 2015 UTC,Don't worry too much about it; even if this was your first video I would have give you a similar critique: to try working with larger concepts in the future. I would really like to see you try something like that!
LSFYL,38zk5a,RhondaOdyssey,2,Mon Jun 8 19:58:51 2015 UTC,"what do you mean ""larger concepts""?"

LSFYL,38zk5a,KyleVisage,2,Mon Jun 8 21:13:02 2015 UTC,"Your lipsyncing technique is perfection. Expressions, enunciation, you have that nailed down and I'm honestly very impressed. I think this song fit you very well too, you had the mannerisms down. The only thing I didn't like was the concept, what with lipsyncing in the basement with a...a weave? I think? It didn't really match the song and it kind of made it less entertaining than it could have been. I know you were going for weird since you said the song was weird, but...idk I could have seen you take a really girly feminine vibe to it and you would have slayed.   But overall you seriously have a talent for this. Out of all the underaged younguns you're probably one of my favorites, if not my favorite!"
LSFYL,38zk5a,calypsooverkill,2,Mon Jun 8 21:39:44 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the critique!

LSFYL,38zk5a,billydarling,6,Thu Jun 11 05:47:28 2015 UTC,"There is so much talent this year, oh my goodness. I have no clue who I think will be moving on or anything!  That said, there are a few that specifically just, I don't know, inspired me.   Billy Darling, when I first saw that this was going to be a 6 minute video, I was thinking ""GOD DAMN, NO ONE WANTS TO SEE YOUR MARS VOLTA INTERPRETIVE DANCE."" But Christ Almighty, I was engaged every second of that.   Kioseth, you inspired me by not just having a stunning look, but managing such a tight lip sync. Your look though, was giving me Jean Grey just getting home from track practice. And I love you for that.  Rhonda, so much swag, so much tough emotion. I could totally feel the distaste in your smug banana.  Dazey, a wonderful concept. You're one of those that inspires this ""WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT??""-ness in me. And you look so pretty.  Gii, your audition was sort of giving me flashbacks to misskittycharm's audition. Not because you're both Asian (but maybe yah), but that tight close up, focusing on just the lips, seductive, mysterious, artistic, just lovely.  Tommy, you've improved so freaking much, and I really think this look and this character is just what you needed. You tend to talk somewhat lowly of yourself sometimes, but with this, all I see is power, fun, sexiness. Keep doing it! You really excel with it!  Axel, the fact that you're so young with this free spirit makes me SICK. What was I doing at your age? Trying to fit in with the straight crowd, playing French horn, and trying to make my dad love me by being in track. You remind me to let loose and just love life.   KHRoxas, I can totally tell that you love this, and that you love this community. You're probably one of the only reasons I even decided to try out again. You love lip syncing and you love lip syncers, and it totally shows in your performance.  EdieCentric, amber waves of grain, girl. True art. Like they should preserve this tape, send it into space, with the intent of showing all the distant life forms what LIVING is.   So I said there were a few, but looking down the line of these auditions, I could probably go on and on about all of them. If you would like feedback please let me know. My fingers are getting all arthritis-y.  I LOVE ALL OF YOU."
LSFYL,38zk5a,BitchEva,3,Mon Jun 8 17:25:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks, GWMW!!! Your video was PER-FOR-MANCE ART, so hearing you say that about mine is huge! PS, I'm stealing ""Mars Volta Interpretive Dance"" for my personal use. You've been warned."
LSFYL,38zk5a,Luna_Rox,3,Mon Jun 8 19:24:27 2015 UTC,I can't wait for us to do our Team Tex-Sass meetup tomorrow night!  By which I mean I am going to burn down your home while you sleep inside.
LSFYL,38zk5a,UEH,7,Tue Jun 9 02:23:31 2015 UTC,"Watched all the audition videos and OMFG this season is already on fleek! I had a hard time picking my top 3 (could have easily done a top 6!) because so many people have brought their A game in their audition videos.  If RPDR is the Olympics of Drag, then this subreddit is clearly the Special Olympics of Lipsyncing!"
LSFYL,38zk5a,wenceslasbelli,7,Mon Jun 8 20:46:33 2015 UTC,"Friendly note to all auditionees who don't make it in: There WILL be carrion threads to follow along with the themes, use these. You'll improve immensely as well as have a leg up on getting in practice for Season 4 next year. Not to mention you'll have some of the most fun you could have all summer if you stick around. If anyone wants any advice I'm free to help in the future."
LSFYL,38zk5a,dazeymayhem,3,Mon Jun 8 10:57:36 2015 UTC,That is a perfect idea! Idid not know that! Thanks for informing!
LSFYL,38zk5a,Bwelchka,6,Mon Jun 8 11:14:37 2015 UTC,"Holy crap, y'all! This is astounding. How this is going to be cut back to only 13 or 14 is beyond me. There are some real stand outs, but damn if there's not a bad audition in the bunch.  Just wanted to give everyone a round of applause and wish all of us good luck. I am even more nervous now than I was to begin with!"
LSFYL,38zk5a,PollyCystic,6,Mon Jun 8 12:45:07 2015 UTC,I know my top 14. I don't know my top 3. There are just too many people that deserve to be in this competition. >:|

I'm a little embarrassed to say that I was far too ambitious in deciding to do a first-ever overseas tour AND this competition at the same time! I haven't even left the country yet, but my preparations had me way too frazzly to be able to submit the week one video :( So, I curtsey away and tip my maxipad to you fascinating, wonderful, inspiring creatures. Can't wait to see what you all come up with, and will still try to throw in a just-for-fun sync in front of the Eiffel Tower, and perhaps with a couple of goats in Worcesteshire. Good luck, and kisses from Down Under to your down-unders ;) xxx"

It's going to be hard to narrow it down to fourteen contestants - and I'm only allowed to vote for 3 people.  I hope the majority of season 3 hopefuls that don't make it carry on lip syncing in the Carrion threads! (See what I did there?) Either way I see some tight lip syncs coming up, whether in portrait or landscape or with special effects or props or jerry rigged with a potato."

I heard about this sub a few weeks ago and wasn't sure what to expect. Seeing not just the talent, but the emotion and dedication all of you have for this fun expression of art and music was incredible. While my work day suffered because of it, I'm happy I stayed up to watch all of you talented people.  14 is going to be a hard number to get to. Especially with /u/ThisPatamon clearly going to take 6 of those spots just for himself!!! D:<  In seriousness: Thanks for being so entertaining everyone. I'm actually sad that there will be fewer videos to watch each week, so I hope everyone is active in these ""Carrion"" threads I keep hearing about."

I am very excited to be watching along this year and gathering ideas/learning from everyone in hopes of doing this next year!   I like to take notes. It is just a thing that Stephanie (the boring human behind the developing character of Claudia) does. So I am transcribing (and sometimes enhancing with gifs and pictures) the notes I took. I did watch everyone's videos (and most until the very end!) but for a good portion I only wrote your name and song title, to jog my memory. Please do not take offense if you are or are not included in this list, as I am no one important! Also pardon my  lack of constructive criticism. I'm bad at taking it, but I will offer it if asked.  dipthonggirl - ""Popular""...turn ya head! Let's see more of ya face!  Luna Rox - ""Crazy"" Gnarls Barkley/Joker Loving this concept (but i really was!)  Ko Rook- ""Fuck You"" king :D Good characterization! Can't wait to see more.  morgana- Bring It On mermaid babe.

LSFYL,38zk5a,billydarling,2,Wed Jun 10 18:27:43 2015 UTC,"Carrion, so named after April Carrion's tradition of showing what she would have done during the weeks after she got the boot from Drag Race, is essentially that in lipsync form. Former contestants, both of the current season and seasons past, as well as new people and people who didn't make the top group of a season play along with the theme of that week for fun. It's a good time. You should participate (or at the very least watch, since many great performances came out of last year's Carrions)."

Unfortunately, my weird work schedule prevented me from making a proper review of all of your vids, but trust me when I say that I immensely enjoyed EVERYONE'S. I'm pumped/terrified to see the results tomorrow, but I know the season's in good hands, regardless if I'm in it or not. WOOOOOO!!"

LSFYL,38zk5a,TheOneDoc,3,Wed Jun 10 00:28:25 2015 UTC,"I lurked a bit last year so I've never reviewed. I don't know what the usual criteria is but I did watch everyone's videos. Everyone did well and there's a good variety of different styles. If it's okay, I think I'll just point out a few people who caught my eye instead of a critique of each video. I will say I was personally drawn to fun songs I recognized with an upbeat energy because I think it fits well for an audition and makes a good first impression.  LSunday- I like the song and the editing. I thought it had a soft romantic vibe.  hollyschtick- Nice change of scenery, pretty colors and fun song.  pierrecruz- You are just a ball of sunshine.  axelknight0717- I like the song, the dancing, it was just cute.  Dazey Mayhem- This seemed very professional. It was like a real audition reel with the supercut and perfect for people like me with short attention spans.  viqule- One of my favorites. It really stood out of the pack as different to me. I thought it might have been an odd song choice but you pulled it off with charm. Kinda remind me of Chris Pratt.  Raven_Night- Really strong song choice and you matched the energy well.  kioseth- I kinda like the song, really like your look.  Rhonda Civic- This is a song that I have to jam to when I hear it. You jammed it out and the outfit and prop made it even more fun.  rawkhawke- It was nice to have a funny one in the mix. Kinda reminds me of when I saw joan's first video. Really cute.  mtd1988- This was awesome! Fun song and shirt, your syncing was really on point.  Gigi Spot- I was getting my life! I like this kind of song and twerking doesn't hurt either."
LSFYL,38zk5a,BitchEva,2,Thu Jun 11 00:46:01 2015 UTC,Thank you! I understand the attention span thing! How do you think I came up with the concept????
LSFYL,38zk5a,TheOneDoc,5,Thu Jun 11 01:43:55 2015 UTC,The competition just started and it's already so goddam hard.

LSFYL,38zk5a,BitchEva,6,Mon Jun 8 07:37:19 2015 UTC,"It's one thing to list your top 14 and encourage them, it's another thing entirely to place seven people specifically in a 'loser' category. Everyone worked incredibly hard and put themselves out there, this isn't fair or kind."
LSFYL,38zk5a,TheOneDoc,3,Wed Jun 10 02:27:54 2015 UTC,"it's another thing entirely to place seven people specifically in a 'loser' category.   I have no ""loser"" category. Not a single entry was horrible.   I want everyone to do good and get better. I think people who have more room to improve should be made aware.   Everyone worked incredibly hard and put themselves out there   I agree 100%   this isn't fair or kind.   I'm sorry that you feel that way."
LSFYL,38zk5a,BitchEva,4,Wed Jun 10 03:32:34 2015 UTC,I just want to know what the Softsculpture group means then. As in how that group combines to make that category. Because 'room for improvement' doesn't ring true if they aren't given any constructive criticism or advice.
LSFYL,38zk5a,TheOneDoc,3,Wed Jun 10 04:08:51 2015 UTC,the ones with multiple weak spots compared to the other groups who typically have one.
LSFYL,38zk5a,BitchEva,4,Wed Jun 10 04:24:37 2015 UTC,So are they or are they not the weaker group? Is that how they were grouped there?
LSFYL,38zk5a,TheOneDoc,3,Wed Jun 10 04:29:28 2015 UTC,So are they or are they not the weaker group?   They are the weaker group.   Is that how they were grouped there?   Grouping is from needs least work (Future Ex Superstars) to needs most work (Softsculpture experts)  The groups in themselfs are in order of the original posting (if not than that's my bad) no ranking there.  The idea here was that after we know who moves on and all the comments are in I go through the weak ones again and do a short write up if I feel something wasn't already covered.  For example xXMysticalaXx & wenceslasbelli got already feedback that covers anything I would have to contribute. So no need to repeat it.
LSFYL,38zk5a,BitchEva,4,Wed Jun 10 04:42:34 2015 UTC,"But if you're going to place yourself in a position of critiquing, which you are by organizing people into these groups, you need to offer your own feedback and useful advice. Like I said, it's one thing to have your own top 13/14 and state it, but it's another thing to single out seven people and label them the weakest with no assistance offered.   If you already know who's weak and you know why you think that, then the time to offer help is now. If you have no feedback of your own, which I don't think is possible, then you're not giving proper critiques and you should probably cut back to your top 14 and stay as a commenter."
LSFYL,38zk5a,Raven_Night,3,Wed Jun 10 04:49:56 2015 UTC,"/u/Raven_Night and /u/BitchEva as the both of you are basically chirping the same song you both get the same answer  First as far as I'm concerned this is pre competition. The rating was ment to give people a rough feel for where I see 'em. No more no less.  Second I'm sorry but I don't have the time to comment on 36 videos.  Third, as I said, my plan was to give the weakest once a second look and comment if I feel a important point wasn't made.   I see no need in having 5 people telling a competitor to not get out of frame or move more/less.  You can feel free to use the search bar and lookup last years comments to know what to expect in the coming weeks."
LSFYL,38zk5a,Raven_Night,3,Wed Jun 10 05:40:25 2015 UTC,If you had time to talk to us then you had time to give the seven people you chose to single out the five seconds needed to explain to them why they were singled out and how to fix it.   That's all.
LSFYL,38zk5a,wenceslasbelli,4,Wed Jun 10 05:47:23 2015 UTC,"Do you know how long it took me to write a good two line critique for these competitors? 10 minutes. Max.   All I hear is an excuse to read these people without dealing with the backlash or, if not that, do any work to help these people.  Categories don't help. Critiques do. If you're not here to help, then don't comment at all."
LSFYL,38zk5a,KHRoxas,3,Wed Jun 10 06:13:52 2015 UTC,"So why not just give them ACTUAL critiques instead of giving backhanded categories that don't help anyone?  These contestants need FEEDBACK to get better, even the good ones. You say they need work, but you don't promote a dialogue to actually help. I've gotten a lot of great feedback from my critiques because I took the time to HELP my fellow competitors."
LSFYL,38zk5a,TheOneDoc,4,Wed Jun 10 04:51:23 2015 UTC,Soft sculpture experts? Am I being read?

LSFYL,38zk5a,Raven_Night,2,Wed Jun 10 20:41:00 2015 UTC,Aw Im so sad I missed this! Good luck to all the auditioners!
LSFYL,38zk5a,dazeymayhem,3,Thu Jun 11 11:01:41 2015 UTC,"Because I love all my brothers and sisters in the competition and I'm here to help and not read, I'm doing actual reviews with my Top 13 bolded.  wenceslasbelli - It was good, but I feel like some of the mouth shapes were a bit funky, possibly a language barrier thing? I don't know. But I did like the song choice.  dipthonggirl - Cute idea, cute execution, but it feels a bit awkward with your partner just kinda sitting there.   Luna Rox - So SO good. I loved the lead up with spoken word and to me, it made sense. Only thing is sometimes the knife would pass in front of your mouth and we would lose the words.   Davis - Love the song, love the makeup however sometimes it felt like you were trying to be campy with it and then you'd pull it back to dramatic, so the energy sometimes felt very mixed.   Ko Rook - The lead up was a bit long and it took a bit to get you moving. For a while you were just standing in one place but it picked up towards the end.  morganawitch - I was so sad when there wasn't an overlay for your sync because the sync itself was actually really good. For me no overlay is fine for the first week, especially since its your first time, but you've probably hurt your chances with some other people.  LSunday - My carrion sister. While I'm glad you chose a mainstream song for your audition this time around, I felt overwhelmed by the effects and they kind of outshined your performance. Doing this much in Week One can also hurt you because you're setting the bar WAAAAY up there.  Michigeek - Cyber, your look is so on point that it hurts to say that the lipsync wasn't on point. You looks beautiful and the fans are my favorite thing ever, but you do a lot of spinning, walking out of frame, and in general, you're just too far away from the camera.  holyschtick aka Hannah - This was such a cute sync and well done. I would say next time, try moving some more instead of sitting and announciate a bit more (SPOILER ALERT: this critique is going to to come up for a lot of you.) because what translate to mirror is different than what picks up on camera  Edie Centric - I love you and I hate you for being so talented and sweet. Only critique would be a little more light so we can see you better, but other than that you were so on point.  pierrecruz - PIERRREEEEEE MY BRAZZILLIAN NUT I LOVED THIS SOOOO MUCH. YOU SERVED ENERGY AND SYNCING LOCKED DOWN.   Rasyndain - This sync was okay but you needed to announciate waaaaay more, the build-up with the fire took a bit too long, and overall the energy didn't quite match the song, especially since Ellie is such a high energy singer.  msgloriaswansong - While I loved the song and the outfit, yet again this is one that need more energy and bigger mouth movements. I get the feeling you might've been trying to match the accent and all that, but it didn't translate well.  KHRoxas - Roxaaaas, I loved this. Lighting was good, energy was good, I loved the addition of the sunglasses. My critique for you is if you're going to make gestures like the smack dat, make them bigger, throw your whole body into it.  axelknight0717 - You are one competitor that I loved but I feel like I've seen this from you in a sense. I think you doing so much off-season kind of hurt you in this respect.   Tommy Riot - This is SUCH an improvement from last year and you took the critiques to heart. You were closer to the camera, more confident, and had such good energy.  xXMysticalaXx - While you are so adorable, the text around the screen was a distraction. Another note is doign Pentatonix is hard. REALLY hard. Trust me, I tried it. I don't quite think this was the best song to start of with because there are so many riffs and runs by multiple people.  Dazey Mayhem - This was so fun and such a good concept. My critique for you is bit a bit more expressive and energetic in your face. Sometimes your face was really blank and unreadable but the lips were on  viqule - You know I love your videos but this one wasn't you best and I think that has to do with the song choice. It was a bit...how do I say this without being a dick...white guy? Like typically surburban white guy music, which is kind of bland and almost generic. (plzdonthatemeforthat)  thelettergii - You suck and I hate you aka this was so good that I want to smother you in your sleep  Skarlet Vainn - While this wasn't a bad sync, you are very handsy. Like hands EVERYWHERE. It was a bit much and a bit distracting. I also wish you had been standing up and moving a bit instead of being static and sitting.  kioseth - You very extremely unexpected! So so pretty, but I fear that the song choice hurt you a bit considering Joan did this song and got top 3 with it during Contempos. You almost moved away from the camera a lot so we'd lose your mouth.   Calypso Overkill - So here's we have you, Calypso, with almost the opposite problem so some of the others. You get in really close to the camera and it didn't really serve any purpose. While this was an okay sync, there were some parts where it felt almost frantic and we needed you to pull it back just a tad. Deep breahtes next time, bb.  girlswhatsmyweakness - While I liked this, I was a bit underwhelmed after your intro which I'll contribute to myself a bit. It just needed some bigger movements, much like what I was telling Roxas. Overall, it was better than last year.  Rhonda Civic - Rhonda how much can I say that I love your videos. The energy was so good that your camera's framerate couldn't keep up with it! You were so good, I got some Katya vibes from this with the random banana and the suit. If you're able to get a better camera, do it.  rawkhawke - This was such a cute and fun video, but not as an audition. I see you benefitting from doing the Carrions because I tell you love to just have fun with these.  BitchEva - This is your best video yet besides kou-PAWNS but no one can defeat that masterpiece. Only thing I needed was more announciation.  superwonkyeyelash - While I liked this, I feel like you were playing with your hair a lot and the camera movement was a bit jerky  alexlopez - I don't know whether this was an art film or a snuff film. Either way, kudos for making me feel uncomfortable. Joking aside, while this was good sync, the song and the concept seemed lacking.   mtd1988 - How dare you do Azaelia Banks and not tell me you slut. I love this song, I love this sync, and I love you. Just next time, bring a bit more announciation and energy. Just a tad, not a lot.  KyleVisage - This was a good song and not a terrible sync, but there are a lot of dead pauses and instead of trying to play those up, you either walked off camera or played with your hair. If you're going to do a song with longer breaks, learn to use them  River - Hello person without an intro! I liked this sync and it wasn't bad at all, but the strobe was a bit distracting. I got why you were using it however  Alex Spears - While your paint got better and you look very pretty, this is the one that, to me, felt like a downgrade for you. Last year you paint was okay and the sync was okay, but at least it was overlayed AND you had more energy. This year you lost the overlay and spent so much time fixing your dress that it made the sync almost unwatchable.  Sheba Maneater - Yet again, no overlay, what is with this year and no overlay? Anyway, good song and not a bad sync even sitting down. I would've liked the camera closer though and the lighting a bit brighter.  Billy Darling - Another unexpected contestant! I loved this sync so so much. So funny, on point, good lighting. 10/10 would watch again. In fact, I will.  Gigi Spot - I hope you take this as a compliment, but you make my lady boner confused, also you stole my fast rap song. ANYWAYS, this a great sync but again, you would move out of frame and sometimes couldn't see your mouth. Try to make sure when you are on in front of the camera to make your vowels wider on your mouth."

Looking in the mirror (and sitting in the chair, for that matter) wasn't my original intent, but with the given surroundings and theme of the song I just wanted to experiment a little. I was TOTALLY expecting that critique! My goal is to bring something different next time, with more focus on the sync itself because this one was so gimmicky."

LSFYL,381gku,joanwaters,14,Mon Jun 1 03:59:57 2015 UTC,"I'm just going to put all my comments in one post so this is gonna be edited a ton! I'm so excited to meet and re-meet everyone, and it seems like there's a LOT of everyone this year ahhhhhhh  ALSO WHAT ARE YOUR USERNAMES MENTION YOUR USERNAMES GOD  DAY 1  Blake/Shillelagh: Hoo boy. What a start to the season. I felt like a criminal after watching your video tbh, what with you talking about underage drinking and jacking off...I'm really curious to see what ""style"" of lipsyncing you're talking about, so I'm expecting to see the same confidence you had in your intro in your audition as well.  Sheba Maneater: I want to love you but I felt like you were overshadowed by the others in the video! But I definitely have a good impression of you, you seem like a nice and dapper lady and I giggled when you mentioned your address.   korook: I wish I met you in Tinychat! Everyone said you were lovely to talk to, so I hope you stop by again sometime. I thought you were a little hard to hear (I get why, ofc) but your transformation at the end told me everything I needed to know. Definitely the one I'm looking forward to most out of the batch, I think you'll be a really strong contender!  Calypso Overkill: HONHONHONHONHON  rawkhawke: You're so fucking adorable tbh I can't handle it! Part of me wonders if you meant to omit talking about your gender because I don't want you to be called by the wrong pronouns if you don't want to be, but I'm sure everyone will get the memo soon enough. One of my faves rn.  axelknight0717: 4 minutes, goodness. I'm really glad you came into the chatroom and we got to know you a little better, you seem like one of those fun guys who throws shade purely for the fun of it and no bitterness. Like, I can't hate you or get mad at you.   Tommy Riot: Tommyyyyy. Good to see you back! I think you're the first returning auditionee we've seen? Again, I'd KILL for more drag kings so I'm so happy to see you, and you're so adorable, you're like if Korook and Rawke had a lovechild. You definitely seem less nervous than last year, keep working on it! I'm so proud of you.  DAY 2  morganawitch: Yaaasss budding drag queen! You're so witty and I enjoyed talking to you in Tinychat, you're one of my favorites out of the Tinychat newbies. I feel like you have a lot of potential to grow and evolve in this competition so I'm really excited to be part of that journey! Also C'MON BUDGET TIARA  Davis the Intern: So glad to see some diversity in the competition...and part Asian to boot, hella! Your facial expressions are to die for. Definitely curious about your audition, I have no clue what you're going to bring but I feel like it's gonna be so fucking great.  Skarlet Vainn: You were so excited about your intro you had to post it early, huh? I feel like I really got to know you in just a minute and 30 seconds, this intro was definitely to the point. B) I would love to see you in drag, I kind of wish I got to see some in your intro because I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL SUNDAY GDI  LSunday: Callback to the CK Review was a clever concept! You bring about this unique air of awkwardness and confidence that I don't think anyone else can do. It seems like green screens and editing are your strong suit, so I'm expecting to see you refine those techniques to a capital T.  Hannah: LOVE your hair, LOVE your voice, LOVE your laugh. I don't know what else to say about your video because I have nothing but love for it and for you. You just seem so approachable and friendly. I can't wait to see your audition, and definitely stop by Tinychat sometime!  mtd1988: Mikeyyyy! Love the Buzzfeed direction you went with, haha. I agree with everything you said about how amazing this community is, I can relate to that so much and your words are absoLUTEly on point. You're one of my favorite people, always and forever.  KHRoxas: My favorite thing was that you started out with all these lights when you're literally known for having no lighting whatsoever on webcam B) So many quips and quotes, I love it. Also I've told you this a million times but I love how adorable and tiny your voice is! But please, never twerk again. kidding <3  DAY 3  viqule: Hey dude! I related a lot to your intro, especially when it came to talking about creativity and confidence...I think we submitted very similar intros, haha. I know you've been working hard all year for this and I know how much you want this (keep telling me you're ok with not making it but I don't believe you), so I'm excited to see you bring it in your audition!  Dazey Mayhem: Welcome! It's so great to see some older members here to keep AgentFear company, I bet you have a ton of experiences to share with us and I can't wait. Unfortunately my attention span only lasts 3 minutes (my fault not yours), buuut for the most part your intro was really engaging and I love you already.  superwonkyeyelash: Sammmmm. I love you and you're adorable but I couldn't hear you over your background music! But that's ok, we don't need to hear you talk in a lipsyncing competition anyway. Have more confidence in yourself though! You're gonna slay in auditions, just find a song you like THAT ISN'T KPOP and bring it! MAKE THE PHILIPPINES PROUD   xXMysticalaXx: Another one I couldn't really hear much of, sadly, but you seem cool! I'm loving that we have more international peeps. I hope you're able to snag a better camera for your audition though, because this one seems to have kind of a low framerate and it might be hard to capture your lipsyncs.   LunaRox: This is literally the least ratchet thing I've seen and I don't understand why you were so worried about coming off as ratchet? Anyways, you're super witty and shady and that'll be fun, because god knows we need some more wit around here >u>  Polly Cystic: Hi Edie's other friend! Loving your look. I really like that through these videos I'm getting to know you, but also Sheba and Edie a little better. I love your friendship, you guys are adorable. I'm really excited to see you lipsync overseas, I think this will make for some really interesting videos!  msgloriaswansong: Probably my favorite intro video today! You can paint, you can crack a joke, I don't even know what you can't do at this point. I have nothing much to say, I'm just blown away by how much I love this. I'm really excited to get to know you better.  Alex Futris: Is it not Alex Spears anymore, then? Welcome back! I actually really enjoyed your audition last year and I'm glad you're going for another shot. Snapchat lipsyncing realnesssss. It's probably better if you film your videos in landscape than portrait for this competition, but you probably already knew that!   DAY 4 is in this reply because screw Reddit's text limit"
LSFYL,381gku,thelettergii,6,Mon Jun 1 05:56:28 2015 UTC,"Had to make a separate comment because apparently this is TOO LONG GDI  DAY 4  michigeek/Cyber LaRose: First LSFYL invades TDR, and now TDR invades LSFYL! I'm so happy to see a TDR queen on here and most of all I'm happy that it's you! You said you were worried about coming off as arrogant in your audition but I could tell it was all tongue-in-cheek, I think you have the perfect drag queen personality: being confident without being too cocky.  RaveNight: Hey manly sister! Or should I say, Lala Chatte? I think it's clear how much you want to win this competition, and I hope the others realize that, because you're going to be a formidable presence and a strong ass competitor. Your lipsyncing portfolio was very strong, you know, especially with the MLG sound effects. Too pro. Truly a beautiful ending.   thelettergii: B)  pierrecruz: Pierreeeeee you are like a ray of sunshine among the shade and I love you forever and ever. Major balls to film in a bed though, haha! I swear everyone said that if you didn't make the cut this season we were all gonna revolt, and I'll happily lead that revolution if that ever happens. GOOD LUCK I LOVE YOU  Edie Centric:  I'm so excited to see what you're going to bring to the competition, but I'm also so nervous because I know I'm going to be slayed by you every single week. The intro format was a little expected after Sheba's and Polly's, but no big deal at all. The part where you wake up with full paint and a glass of wine right there -- I wish I had the life you lead.  girlswhatsmyweakness: I had a great time chatting with you last night! Definitely a strong intro, loved your idea, tons of dedication and cookie butter obviously went into it. I think there was a note of sincerity in your intro too, in that you really want to make it this season -- I know you were a strong contender last season and I expect you to be one this year too!  billydarling: The first of several non-drag queen dudes today! I feel like you resemble the love child of two LSFYLers...I can't decide if it's Zoom and Gabe or SailorEvan and Ariel Italic, but it's definitely one of the two. I don't really have much to say because your intro was short and sweet, but I like you a lot and I'm excited to get to know you better!  KyleVisage: HI MOOCHY HI! I seriously wasn't expecting this to be as funny as it was, but you had some great jokes and one-liners and definitely one of my favorite intros today. I was laughing so hard the first time I watched this. Definitely one of the biggest surprises this week for me, in a good way!  Rasyndain: Bald head + lipstick = boldest look yet, I'm living. I'm going to forget how to pronounce your name a lot but thankfully I'll be typing most of the time! You're friendly, you're funny, you're Deborah, you're the whole package. DEBORAH! Don't worry about being only a recent fan, it seems like you picked up on the basics of what makes an entertaining video and I hope your strategy pulls through!  kioseth: C'mon filming on the car and somehow not getting in a car crash! C'mon being hilarious in one take! C'mon did you think no one was going to understand your Chinese BECAUSE I DID...and it was not bad! C'mon adorable puppies! C'mon adorable you!  seanoc23: A lot of people putting their lipsyncing videos in their video huh? Glad they're not going to waste! You had a strong intro last year and another strong intro this year. Despite all the Drag Race quotes, the Tina bit is my favorite part. Here's to hoping you bring a strong audition to match your strong intro this season!  Jzeus Christ so many intros. YOU BETTER ALL HAVE YOUR AUDITIONS IN YO I'M ROOTING FOR YOU WE'RE ALL ROOTING FOR YOU."

Candypepper, also known as druidcandy, and I'm gonna be unnecessarily harsh on introduction videos because I'm unemployed, lost two separate competitions, and have nothing better to do!  C.C. REVIEW WEEK 0-1  Blake: I... I'm kind of interested in seeing more of you, but this was a trainwreck. Is your drag name Shillelagh? Because that's what it sounded like. I know these videos are optional, but like... These are our first impressions of you, unless you're drunk all the time (In which case I'd suggest a few AA meetings), try something that's a better indicator of your personality. Also 16 year olds shouldn't be telling others that they're jerking off, that's gross. They shouldn't be drinking publicly either but if I go off too hard on underage drinking I will look like the biggest hypocrite  Sheba Maneater: Oh god, there's another one. I love a more quiet, subtle, snarky wit, but sometimes those personalities don't translate well to performances, which is always a pain in the ass. Still, you seem like a real goodtime gal, which I can appreciate. Brush your hair before you go on camera~  korook: You're pchill from like the five seconds we've interacted in TC. I can't think of much else to say about that other than that real self-contained statement, because I don't want to have sex with you. Must be a bi/pan thing. Still, you look great, and I can't wait to see what you have in store for us~ I fuckin use tildes too much, goddamn  CalypsoOverkill: I don't see what the big deal is, this is what all french people sound like to me. Let's see what you manage to pull out for your audition~ Shame I can't make fun of Otterbox's accent anymore, but what can you do  rawkhawke: I mean this in the nicest way but when I first saw you come up I thought to myself ""I cook an egg with a spoon Amelie. Fall in love with me Amelie."" Sir, you are adorable, and I wonder what you're going to show us next. Granted I wonder the same thing about almost everyone but... You're cool. Yeah.  axelknight0717: No lmao, no shade, but you're weirdly charming in a way I can't really explain in a non-offensive manner. The showing of all your clips was cute, but it would have been funnier if you sped it up after the 3rd one or so, to emphasize how many you have without letting the joke drag on a little bit. Still, can't wait to see what you audition with.  Tommy Riot: It's good to see you back, brosoeph! It's also cool to see that you're also fleshing out your drag persona beyond just being... Being. Best of luck to you, Tommy! Also sidenote I am so glad several kings are straight up auditioning as opposed to the girls just dragging up as a surprise"

REVIEW WEEK 0-2  morganawitch: I heard you were auditioning again, /u/thatleafeon! It's so refreshing to see you in drag  Awful jokes aside let's... See where this goes. Idk, I feel like trash queens who are intentionally trash have an uphill battle when it comes to impressing others. You're gonna have to really fight, Morgana, for other people to be super into it. Christeene isn't iconiq just because she looks the way she does, dahling hunty chilllde  Davis the intern: God, that's got to be an awful name to live with. Like how do you introduce yourself like james bond? Like fuckin say hi to mr. Intern. We don't pay him. I'm inebriated, and I apologize for that. You're entertaining, and I'd like to see  if this translates to videos.  BitchEva: U r my sunshin. mai only sunshin. u maek me heppby. when skys r grety. ul never no deer. how much i l u. so pls dont dake my sunshen awey.  Skarlet Vainn: I'm gonna show u what it's like to stop being nice and start being real. No I'm not. Anyways I've never been a super big fan of queens who's names are just two words slapped together with fucked up spellingzzzzz because I have Herstory with those kinds of queens and I'm leaving it at that to at least pretend I'm a lady for a little while longer. I hope you can excite me for you, because I'm overwhelmingly neutral rn.  PS patience is a virtue xoxo gossip girl  LSunday: I'm like thinking ""Oh wow greenscreen has really improved, kyle looks so good against the backgrop"" and then ""oh wow, it looks like Carrie is discarding her physical form to join the ethereal plane before lipsynching"". Let's hope you dont' get too into your head and into art and concepts and stuff, we're watching lipsynchs not student films about loss and poetry and whatever young bohemians make content about these days  Hannah: You're cute, and not to be overly mean to people that I don't know, but probably my favorite video of people who I didn't know super well beforehand!!!!!!!!!! Sorry everyone else, ask Hannah why you look like dog turds! You all don't look like dog turds and I was going to say someone's name to drive home that this is a joke but I'm pretending to be nice so you'll all open up to me emotionally so I can ruin everything you hold dear later on.  mtd1988: You're cool.

ANYWAYS C.C. REVIEW WEEK 0-3  viqule: Who's that  Dazey Mayhem: Come on, season 1 filter! Come on, not being able to see facial features because of light nonsense! I love me my old mature womens, but I'm a little nervous that you said you don't lipsynch often. While auditioning for a lipsynching competition. The competition is kind of stiff straight out of the gate, considering you're fighting at least 23 other people out of the gate, not including whoever else shows up the rest of the week, so you'd better be ready to fight biiiish. (Also tone down the lighting, I want to see more of your face than your lips)  superwonkyeyelash: I heard nothing that you said over Willam and Alaska, so I'm assuming the video is about them and I'll review them instead. They're a pretty solid duo and I know Courtney's busy, but it still seems strange to have a video with just 2/3 of the AAA girls. Still, for a parody song made for an event, it's not that bad and they work well playing off each other. It's a good video.  xXMysticalaXx: Girl gorl Gworl. Please tell me you have a better functioning camera, because I swear to god, you had so few frames I never saw your mouth close when you were talking, and that's gonna be an issue when I try to look at you move your lips later. Idk, you seem nice, I just think technology might end up holding you back from the competition.  LunaRox: Wow Noah the uk hasn't been kind to you  A lot of jokes about one subject at the start which started to get a little tired, LIKE JOAN'S ASSHOLE, UP TOP repetitive, but you managed to showcase some wit in your video despite it being short-ish. I can't wait to see what kinds of videos you end up doing~  Polly Cystic: The second of the loose aussie women. Idk, I wasn't feeling this as hard as I felt Sheebah's. By which I mean I wasn't touching myself. Anyways, you were fun? But... Idk, you just felt a little more low key than some of the other girls. It's good to see you've got the same twisted sense of humor as the other girls though, and I'd love to see what you make of it.  msgloriaswansong: God, I love queens who get dragged up for auditions. Makes it easier to judge you all based on first impressions. So I'm not going to lie, I love brassy broadway diva kinds of queens which means I'm going to be hideously biased towards you and you should probably look towards others for concrete feedback. Still, this was a p strong introduction, let's hope you keep the momentum going into next week!~  Alex Futris: Why all the dutch angles, hold your camera strai- Okay now you have it turned in the other direction, just hold it up like- yeah that's fi- no don't turn it to the side again, hold it strai- Why are you doing this to us-  I appreciate the montage to show off your skills, and I can understand the videos from snapchat, but... I don't mean to be rude, but learn to overlay your videos, it takes five seconds and we can watch you do Sparks without hearing your ceiling make noises at you. I'm not super sold on you, but you seem like a chill person with some... interesting tastes. (Pretty Girls? Really girl)"
LSFYL,381gku,dazeymayhem,3,Wed Jun 3 05:03:08 2015 UTC,"Totally agree. The overexposure was a creative choice due to a glitch in the matrix. ""Floating Nostril"" is not a look I typically try to achieve in my videos. Fortunately it's fixed now - no longer shooting on the face of the sun with vaseline on the lens.   I'm nervous too, but there's still some fight in this old ho yet, so here's hoping I can hold my own with the kids! Thanks for the input!"

It's almost like most stories written with that crap are meant as wish fufillment! C.C. REVIEW WEEK 0-4 C.C. HARDER god this is like double the videos I normally watch, or some number around there because I like complaining  michigeek: Hey, let me do my Cyber impression. (Cowardly Lion on Valium voice) Hhhi. Ih'm Cyber LahRohsee. Mmmmmmmmmmmmm zaddy. Me making fun of you in ""stage"" mode aside, this is a fun video that shows off both your personality and your awful side because of Never Gonna Give You Up in the background. Bonus points for full Cyber showing up in the video, but I lightly mentioned me liking queens auditioning as queens anyways so let's move on to someone I like  RaveNight: I said someone I like, goddamn it. Not the physical manifestation of what would happen if you combined COD with gender identity issues. Cute intro, shows off personalities and talent. It was kind of quiet but whatever I can't change the fact that you're bad at editing audio so it's something we'll all have to live with. Luv u <3 Okay but for reals now LET'S MOVE ONTO SOMEONE I LIKE  thelettergii: DAMN IT. DAMN IT DAMN IT DAMN IT. In any event, this is a really cute video and it is a great introduction to you even though it doesn't have a portfolio of videos attached to it. Cute and heartfelt and great and I'm not biased because you took photos for me various times.   pierrecruz: Oh my god, I was worried I wasn't going to like anyone who submitted an introduction today. PIERRREEEEEEEE I LOVE YOUUUUUUUUUU. I love how even with no plan and basically just stream of consciousness horseshit, you're still adorable and able to put out an entertaining video. I have to ramble for five hours to cut it down to something that people will enjoy, so to just be able to do it off the cuff is a talent. Can't wait to see your lipsynch~  Edie Centric: And the ""itty"" of the australian Trinity and also as in the american Titty. I love how I'm pretty sure I've seen all the australians with white wine. Brings a sense of camraderie. Cute video and cute general introduction to the effervescent mystique that is Edie, although I would have liked to see more of your weird and wonderful shine through other than offhandedly mentioning you're drinking piss. Still, I can't wait to see what Australiatox pulls out~  girlswhatsmyweakness: Come on, arthouse film. Come on, universally canned at cannes. Come on, shunned at sundance. I don't know any other film festivals. Not much to say, other than good to see you back! Also not a bad idea on just shooting a minifilm for an intro, it's something that not many people can pull off.  Billy Darling: Billy, dahhhhhlingggggg........... I don't have much else to say, your intro was kinda short and you mostly said ""hi"" and your name. You seem like a pchill person though.  KyleVisage: Yo diggity, moochy. Not bad, the video's pretty fun. I would deffo recommend backing up though, that's a real uh. Close and personal shot. And look at the camera, nobody likes being ignored unless they're like... I can't name one person here that isn't an attention whore. God.  Rasyndain: Love me a good whore red lip. I like your generally goofy demeanor/sense of humor, so I'm gonna be keeping an eye out on you. You're like a good young Mrs. Kasha Davis kind of person, and I enjoy that. I'm saying that mostly because both of you are bald and also because I am not a good person.  kioseth: You seem like a real cool dude! Granted I'm automatically inherently biased because you have dogs and they are named after video game characters I think so automatically you're super cool in my book. I also appreciate a queen who doesn't contour, because who gives a shit? I'm constantly fishing for fresh fish fishily all the time and nobody including literally everyone I've ever met can tell me nothing  Seanoc23: Why are you funnier in your videos than you are in real life?  (Taps nails against desk) Quickly.  Realtalk though I somehow can't not make fun of you, so I'm just going to keep this short and give you a  <3  RhondaOdyssey: Giving me 80's beach twink hit with an age ray by a sexually frustrated supervillain, yas quen. Loving the new paint job Rhonda, now let's see how you handle the roads~ Wow that was stupid by my standards. I hate this. I hate america."

DAY 1  Blake: The whole video I was trying to figure out how you got your hands on alcohol at 16. Whoops.  Sheba Maneater: YOU WERE SO FUNNY. I also know an asshole named Scott. And your video was the first one I watched more than once.  korook: I don't get the name. Whoops. But I liked your video.  CalypsoOverkill: I actually thought you were French until I read the description.  rawkhawke: CMON LAGANJA REFERENCES! I really liked your video, and I can't wait to see your first lip sync.  axelknight0717: That's a lot of lip syncs. I kinda feel like you were overshadowed by the others, but maybe that's just me.  TommyRiot: I thought your video was actually really funny and I love your character backstory. Also I really hope your first lip sync is to ""Life on Mars"" by David Bowie.   DAY 2  morganawitch: I too march to the beat of my own thumb. (Also you were funny as hell and keep doing what you're doing)  Davis the Intern: I'm still confused. Is your last name really Intern?   BitchEva: HI EVA HI. REMEMBER ME? IT'S MOOCHY. You're really funny and I genuinely hope you get chlamydia win.  Skarlet Vainn: I really like your drag name because misspelling and puns are two of my favorite things. I can't wait to see you in drag.   LSunday: BITCH TRYING TO STEAL MY NAME. But I really loved the CK Review and your Carrion Lipsyncs last season so I'm really excited to see you in the competition.  Hannah: Your hair is really pretty and your video was funny. I too am an avid lurker.  mtd1988: HEY I KNOW YOU TOO. I liked your video, but I did kinda feel like you were overshadowed by some of the others in day 2.  KHRoxas: How long did it take to make that intro? That's better editing than I could probably ever do. (but that's not much because all I can do is jump cuts and shitty overlaying)  DAY 3  viqule: Your beard is cool and I know you're a really good lip syncer so I'm excited to see what your first video is.  DazeyMayhem: DAZEY! I really love your Rundown videos and you're really funny. Also you should teach me how to edit. Because I can't do it for my life.  superwonkyeyelash: At first I thought Gia Gunn was auditioning. But I couldn't really hear you in your video. But I'm excited to see your first lip sync!  xXMysticalaXx: Like with mtd and axel, I feel like you were overshadowed. And I don't know if that camera's gonna work well for your syncs :(.   LunaRox: YOU WERE SO FUNNY. And that's a really good camera. And your accent is really cool.   Polly Cystic: You were really funny too. I can't wait to see what you do for your first lipsync! (ALSO YOUR NAME IS GREAT)  msgloriaswansong: You kind of remind me of Joan and I love your name. Definitely excited to see what you bring Sunday.

Very chill, and I love that you've been keeping in touch with the community. As an English teacher though, your math = my wrath. 4 =  x = [ -b ± sqrt(b2 - 4ac) ] / 2a out of 5 stars.  Dazey Mayhem Gorgeous. Possibly my favorite of the personalities thus far. Your look bears a resemblance to Kate Mara. So fabulous. As far as this audience being sober, honey, I don't think you have anything to worry about. 4 out of 5 stars.  superwonkyeyelash So unfortunately, I was listening to your intro video while I work my second job at an aluminium factory, so I couldn't really hear much of what you said. However, I did catch your love for Willam (which is essential) and I did hear phrases such as ""dancer and make up artist"" which excites me and ""I believe I can slay,"" which, I believe you can slay, too. Go for it, bitch. (Also where can I find your beautiful Hindi-style elephant T-Shirt?) 4 out of 5 stars.  xXMysticalaXx: ""I have no talent."" Excuse me, ma'am. You have an ABUNDANCE of talent. You know how to record a video, you are fluent in Tumblr, Youtube, and now Reddit. It takes talent to be able to navigate these things. Use this to your advantage. We want to see you do well! 4 out of 5 stars.  LunaRox HILARIOUS. I love Wales. Not whales. Those are actually my biggest fear. But correct me if I'm wrong but is there not a large plateau there named ""Blorenge""? To all my Grade 7 English students, there ARE things that rhyme orange! 4 out of 5 stars.  Polly Cystic Oh Cyster, Cyster. You and Sheba have me so worried! There's this Australian Rolaskatox that's been brewing in the Down Under and I didn't even seen it coming. Love the technique on the ironing. Very educational. Another one I'm waiting anxiously to watch. 4 out of 5 stars.  msgloriaswansong Well, I'm jealous of who gets to be Mr. Gloria Swansong! Love the early Hollywood influence. Swansong seems abrasive yet comforting, like a wool sweater, or that one dildo that's been used since Obama's first inauguration. 4 out of 5 stars.  Alex Spears I wouldn't say that you made me laugh/feel sorry for you. Those clips you showed of your Snapchat fame were beautiful. You are hypnotic to watch!

Just wanted to wish everyone good luck (just not so much good luck that you take a bite out of my luck and make me unlucky and I don't make it thru because I really want this) and I can't wait to see the auditions!!!

Excited to see you in your full look competing. 4 out of 5 stars.  Raven_Night Don't you worry about that set dressing, girl. My chambers were all sorts of filthy from me wallowing in my own self doubt for months. I'm excited to see you back. Hopefully you won't have to carrion, my wayward son, and you can just bring us your videos in the main competition! 4 out of 5 stars.  thelettergii You're like...the sweetest human being...on Earth. I love how poised and thought-out your feelings about the competition were. It's clear that you're new to this, but the excitement you have toward the competition is there. Also, I HAVE A JOKE, TOO! What's brown and sticky? A brown stick! 4 out of 5 stars.  pierrecruz In absolute love. I just wanna buy you a life's supply of Berry Acai Absolute Vodka. A-ha! A-ha! A-ha! Really hope I get to see you in the competition! 4 out of 5 stars whooOOooo!  Edie Centric What I love about you is that I'm super intimidated by you, because you're certainly and obviously talented, but at the same time, I want to be your friend. I remember watching your Spoken Word entry and being blown away. 4 out of 5 stars.  Billy Darling Great smile and attitude. It's awesome to see that this community has reached so many new people. 4 out of 5 stars.  KyleVisage Someone get this bitch some spaghetti, because she is serving sauuuuuuuuce. 4 out of 5 stars.  Rasyndain I feel like we all have a little Deborah living inside us. I'm glad we got to meet yours. Very funny, and you have excellent and snappy timing. 4 out of 5 Deborahs.  kioseth Oh man, what if you performed all of your lip syncs while DRIVING? I mean, I'm pretty sure that we've all done that, whether it be practicing, or just sitting bored in traffic, or making a long distance drive to a friend's wedding. That could be GREAT! 4 out of 5 cars.  Seanoc23 Well, look who it is! I still remember the explosion sound from last year when you death dropped onto the scene. I kind of disappeared after not making it, but it's obviously you took your time off really seriously. Good for you! 4 out of 5 stars.  Thanks to all that gave me feedback on my intro. I was really wary of trying out again since not making it last time affected me really in a dumb way, but it's clear that this community is driving LOVE all the way down to Pennsylvania Avenue."

I also feel that even though I have massively improved my audition video. My intro video may have destroyed my chances. My mind completely over works itself. You are all so pretty @-@
LSFYL,381gku,thelettergii,3,Fri Jun 5 16:00:51 2015 UTC,"You're a special, and a pretty, and a wonderful. Just by doing this you've jumped in to something new, and that's a win in itself. Sync your heart out, and we'll love you for it no matter what happens. You got this."

Most of us aren't dumb enough to discount someone's audition based on not enjoying their intro -- not that I didn't enjoy your intro, but you left a positive impression on me both here and in Tinychat so I'm really looking forward to your audition actually. Basically DON'T OVERTHINK IT OR I'LL PAT YOUR FACE SLIGHTLY FORCEFULLY  BELIEVE IN YOURSELF I BELIEVE IN YOU"
LSFYL,381gku,viqule,3,Fri Jun 5 16:41:14 2015 UTC,Most of us aren't dumb enough   But I AM
LSFYL,381gku,Noahk519,2,Fri Jun 5 19:41:35 2015 UTC,"Sorry about being late with all this...  (Day 1)  Blake: Howdy there! Yay Kentuckians! Congrats on being the first person to pop up on the intro list! You definitely have a level of confidence to you, and that will bode well in this competition. I’ll definitely be interested to see the intro to bring to us this Sunday! =)   Sheba Maneater: The first of the epic unholy trinity! You appear to have your homemaker sensibilities about you, and you apparently need no man! That alone made your intro a treat to watch, so I can’t wait to see your audition vid this weekend!  korook: Despite being whispery, you killed your introduction video. You brought in a good amount of a humor and personality, plus you showed us your transformation, something that bodes well with us viewers. As one of the great batch of drag kings we have up for the bloodbath this season, I definitely plan to keep my eye out for your audition coming up soon.  Calypso: You tricked us all, and mad props for doing so – you’ll stick in our minds as we look for which videos to watch first. It’s also great that you’ve been coming to the TC! I’m anxious to see what ya bring to the table.  rawkhawk: You are adorable. You have this great personality that I don’t think anyone could dislike, and that makes you rootable – don’t let go of that! =) Your subsequent videos will be just as amazing for it.  axel: Hey, duder! Ever since back to the first challenge this off-season, you’ve been persistent, and it shows! You’ve gotten extremely better over this past year, and you’re personality is super-hardcore solid as well. I can’t wait to see the video you’ve submitted for week 1! =)  Tommy: Yay, Tommy! I’m super-glad you are auditioning again. Your introduction was so unique, and with the added feline, it isn’t hard to find you epicly cool. Definitely continue to grace us with your tinychat presence and I can’t wait to see the audition you’re bringing to the table!!  (Day 2)  Morgana: Welcome! You gave a wonderfully quirky introduction that I’m certain made more than a few people chuckle.  Your personality shined brightly during those 66 seconds, and I have no doubt your audition video will do the same. =)  Davis: You give good font, gurl. You also give good humor and funny faces. I also enjoy those about the world who engage in misanthropy, so you’ve gained all the good points that could make me interested. I can’t wait to see what your produce (probably while on the job!) for this competition. =)  Eva: The fact that you used Little Jackie in your intro makes me swoon right then and there. Meeting you this past year has been an absolute blessing, as I adore your personality and humor. You also are a formidable lipsyncer who knows how to bring out that humor on camera (See: the candle video). I am bursting with excitement to see your video come Sunday/Monday. =)  Skarlet: A Canadian (or 2, 3, …) is always good to have in this competition, and I am glad you are one of them. You give off a sense of confidence (which is very good!) and it makes me all that much more excited to see what you submit. Also, getting to speak with ya in the Tinychat is rad as well!   Sunday: Going from a real Canadian to the queen who won the Canada challenge during the off-season, we’ve all seen what you can accomplish, and when it comes to auditioners who I am intrigued to watch perform, your vid definitely ranks HIGH on my list. =)  Hannah: Welcome to the limelight, Hannah! You seem bubbly and adorable, and you know your LSFYL history, so I am stoked to see what you are gonna give to us in a few days. Plus, TURTLE! <3  mtd1988: You nailed the comedy and showed to the audience that it is one of your strongest assets, something that will definitely come in handy during the competition. I wish ya the best of luck come Sunday night, yo.  Roxas: I’m always a fan of self-deprecating humor, but I also know you are humorous in a legion of other formats as well. Your spoken word challenge was stellar, and you are good at finding songs that either really nail the punchline or otherwise fit the theme solidly. I am stoked to check out what you’ll have for us in the mix, buddy."
LSFYL,381gku,dazeymayhem,2,Sat Jun 6 02:31:21 2015 UTC,"(Day 3)  Viqule: I still don’t know whether that thing was working.  Dazey: You appear to be a queen with a massive amount of experience, and for that, I think we’re all fortunate to have you competing here. Plus, you gave us hardcore production quality, and a mini-show while we are watching. All of these things are sure to gain you a fair amount of new fans, and it makes me super-excited to click on your video when round 1 begins. =)  Wonky: I’ve been excited to see you along with all the others that have joined us for Tinychat over the past few days! It was there that I got see your diva personality come through. I can’t wait to see what you’ll give us for audition week; I have no doubt it will be stellar!  Mysticala: Hey there! I love that there are so many non-US people auditioning (does this mean that the winner is the global champion, then?), and with a shirt like that I am glad you are one of them! Plus, you have mentioned your audition video will have enough picture quality to show off your awesome lip-sync abilities, so any concerns about that from your intro have thankfully been resolved! Good luck, holmes!  Luna: People have compared you to Noah, and considering how funny and charismatic he is, it think that is a fair comparison when explaining you. You had me in belly laughs, so I am spastic to see your performance  – and your song choice has me even more excited!  Polly: Numero Deux in the wonderfully unholy trinity, and probably my favorite thing about you was that interweaving of your character into your real self. It offers us honesty (and vulnerability? Sure), and it makes you a stellar contender to survive the bloodbath that is coming our way. I hope you’ll document your travels for all of us to see!  Gloria: Funny, witty gal. You oozed comedy and charisma, and you bring a sparkling glow to the drag competing this year. I hope you keep sassy and adorable, ‘cause that skill will no doubt be a valuable asset for the auditioning round.  Alex Spears: Welcome back, Ms. Spears! It’s good to see you audition again, and you look to deliver the excitement that is necessary for our little, happy community. Plus, we got to see a lot of examples of you perform, so I expect nothing less than what you’ve offered there! Can’t wait to see your audition!  (Day 4)  michi/Cyber Larose: It’s neat to see the crossover from other internet competitions, plus watching those sample clips definitely shows that you have the performance chops about you. You also give us a bunch of sass and confidence. I expect wonderfully diva things coming from ya this upcoming week – all in the audition vids, of course!  Raven: You know how much I adore your videos – almost as much as I adore you! You give great performances, as well as strong diversity. Your “Partition” video is one of the most epic videos I’ve seen on here, and I know that your work ethic to make it on here would put just about any other constant here (me, included) to shame. You know I hope you make it on here, madame, and I can wait to see what the next installment of your videos will provide us.  Gii: You are amazing. You are so bright and contagiously cheerful and creative. You’ve made us laugh and your talent has truly shown through. Your video ain’t half bad either. I am exceptionally fortunate to know you, and you know I’ll be one of the biggest fans of your audition vid come the big reveal.  Pierre: Your snapchats are stellar, your personality is infectious, and your introduction definitely signifies that you’ll give us nothing less than excellence for your audition vid. You’re representing Brazil perfectly, good sir.  Edie: Anyone who has a poster for “Female Trouble” on one’s wall has me as a fan. Each offseason challenge you’ve done has given us your own Edie brand of charm and excellence, and I have no doubt you’ll have a glorious batch of ideas baking in the oven, ready to serve the children.  GWMW: Girl, I don’t know about you, but my weakness is that video of yours. You nailed the introduction, and I know that the majority of viewers have their eye out on the awesomeness you’re gonna throw our direction. Plus, any fellow bearded syncer has my excitement and attention. While it sucks we didn’t get to see your talents full-bloom last year, I hope this season gets to see you in action. With those squats, you’ve earned it. (And about your math comment – I like reedin’, 2.)  Billy Darling: Yay, a fellow Season 2 stalker! I’m glad you’ve decided to audition for season 3! It’s good that you know your video history and hopefully you’ll be using that to give us an excellent video this coming Sunday night. =)  Kyle Visage: Moochy! I’m glad you have decided to submit your audition for season 3.  You’re a funny one, no doubt, and I hope that this translates to your videos, because we always need humor. Good luck, buddy!  Rasyndain: I think you need to fire Deborah, but you seem to be rad enough without her, so it’s a pleasure to see your introduction! I liked your intro quite a bit, and I know you’ll bring that personality and emotion into the lip sync you’ll give us on Sunday night. Good luck, man!  kioseth/Conor: Driving and filming is dangerous, and I appreciate a performer who laughs in the face of danger! It’s great to see your newfound passion for drag, and I’m glad you found our community in the process. Good luck, and I hope your wedding stuff was rad!  Seanoc23: Oh, Tina. I think you gave us a great intro, and I’ve watched you hit the nail on the coffin Canada week, so I am excited to see what you’re bringing us to start off the competition =)  wenceslas: You nailed the intro’s lipsync, giving us some theGstandsforGabriel realness. You gave us humor, and it’s awesome to see you add some more fantastic international space to our lip sync stew.  RhondaOdyssey: Yesssssss! You have been missed around these parts, and it has everything to do with your amazing personality. You know how to bring the comedy, and more importantly the smart comedy, that makes me a fan. Super-stoked to see what you’ll give us in the new coming days."
LSFYL,381gku,thelettergii,2,Sat Jun 6 02:32:12 2015 UTC,Dawwwww. I like that I'm gone but not forgotten.  LOVED your video and I'm so pulling for you this season. You consistently deliver. Rock it.
LSFYL,381gku,girlswhatsmyweakness,2,Sat Jun 6 03:29:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that. It's really a challenge to figure out how to translate what I do into this medium, but I'm up for it.

LSFYL,381gku,greatjake122,2,Sun Jun 7 02:45:06 2015 UTC,"people are critiquing intro vids? lol,  I find this strange and amusing.  Again I'll save making any attachments to anyone till after I see who makes the cut.    Maybe Next year we can combine the two weeks so we get to see an intro AND the audition at the same time?  TBH I'm just cranky cause I thought I'd get to see some syncing and I was off by a week.  But almost there!"
LSFYL,381gku,girlswhatsmyweakness,3,Sun Jun 7 18:02:46 2015 UTC,"I wasn't critiquing them so much as commenting on them, and I think that would apply for most of us. I know if no one said anything about my video I'd be pretty sad, even if it was as dumb as a small introduction, so I wanted to at least say something about everyone's videos.  But I agree about not attaching yourself until at least audition week. Intros are a great way to hype up competition imo so I'm ok with intros before auditions, but contrary to what everyone is fearing, the intros don't mean that much to the competition in the end."
LSFYL,381gku,girlswhatsmyweakness,2,Sun Jun 7 19:17:00 2015 UTC,OKay you make wonderful points cause the second I put anything out into the abyss of the internet and it gets even one comment I'm through the roof and wanting MORE.  (LIKE THIS! thank you for adding this comment!) especially if I filmed a vid all about me I'd like some sort of acknowledgement. So yes a very good point.
LSFYL,381gku,girlswhatsmyweakness,3,Tue Jun 9 01:47:09 2015 UTC,"Wave 1:  Blake: I'm not gonna judge you for being drunk and horny when you made this intro, because whenever I see Joan Waters announce anything, I get the exact same way. Good for you for taking initiative. Killing birds with stones, and all that. 4 out of 5 stars.  Sheba Maneater: Lovable. Hugable. Palpable. I'm in Season 3 mode, at this point. Loving the sass and the white wine, and the supportive galpals. Watch out bitches, cuz she'll chew you up. 4 out of 5 stars.  korook: You look straight out of the Haus of Stark! So hot. And endowed! Loved seeing the transformation, and your humor is making me queef. 4 out of 5 stars.  CalypsoOverkill: Very impressive vocal range! I'm interested to see how these accent-studies will translate to lip syncing. Someone please reignite the foreign language challenge! I could totally see you doing some Edith Piaf. 4 out of 5 stars.  Rawkhawke: Giving me girlswhatsmyweakness-circa-Season-2-audition-tape realness. I was the same way, girl. Totally stepping into this thing without being really sure what I was doing. Be confident. We want to see you do well! except me. I want to advance you silly bitch ;) 4 out of 5 stars.  axelknight0717: Love the passion and the dedication. The fact that the first season of RPDR came out when you were 10, however, is giving me the runs. What was I doing at 10? Probably drawing pictures of Cloud Strife naked...My illustrations? 4 out of 5 stars.  Tommy Riot: Goddammit, Tommy, what have I told you about putting your pussy on display before getting to know everyone first! So glad to see you back (our first repeat auditioner!)

Unless you mean for something you're doing. Sure!"
LSFYL,34kpjk,Noahk519,4,Mon May 4 16:17:19 2015 UTC,"I chose my audition song because it was one I thought I could lip sync really tightly. I figured that doing something dramatic would be different from a lot of the other contestants. If I were doing it again, I probably wouldn't go that route, as I don't think an emotional song is a good first introduction. I do think it's a good idea to pick something that will set you apart from the other contestants. I am a very visual person, so I want to know that this person has a concept/vision/clear character. You don't need props, advanced drag, or green screen. All you need is creativity and imagination (see basic week)! We are going to have a ton of low-res videos of people performing top 40 songs straight into the camera. There's nothing wrong with that, but you want to make sure that whatever you do sticks in people's brains this week. Dare to do something different! It generally pays off.  As far as technical lip syncing goes, exaggerate your mouth movements way more than you think to need to. Watch how you look on camera. See if you have any nervous habits or motions that you keep repeating (brushing hair out of your eyes, pointing, rolling eyes, hand movements). Sometimes you don't realize that you're doing it until you see yourself, so you want to make sure that you're not doing anything that distracts from the sync in a bad way. My better videos sometimes took 20+ takes, so don't get frustrated if you don't get a perfect take the first few times! It's worth it to keep at it until you get something you are REALLY happy with, especially introduction week.    I'm totes here for anyone who has questions/needs an impartial opinion from someone not competing/needs help with anything production wise. I had the absolute best time doing this competition last year, and I will do absolutely anything to remain relevant."
LSFYL,34kpjk,TheHarperValleyPTA,2,Sat May 2 04:14:08 2015 UTC,"I picked my JAM at the time. If you have a connection to the song, it shows in your performance. It happened to be a dynamic song emotionally and musically, which I think helped. I look to be ENTERTAINED. Keep my attention for the whole song (harder than it sounds) and I'll consider voting for it."
LSFYL,34kpjk,Babeford,4,Sat May 2 14:05:55 2015 UTC,"People talk a lot about the technical elements here, and I agree that things like filter effects and green screen have become increasingly important, but in the end it's all about PERFORMANCE. I chose my first song because I knew I could not only nail the lip sync, but also have a great time performing it. Plus, it was an upbeat classic that everybody loved, so I knew people would have a good time with the video based on that alone. You have to work a lot harder to sell a song when people aren't familiar with it. For me, an audition is all about screen presence. Knowing the lyrics is the most basic part of the process. A costume or quirky setting is just icing on the cake, and for me not that necessary, especially in an audition. I want to see what people bring to the lip sync. Facial expression, body language, connection to the material, commitment to the performance, personality... that kind of thing."
LSFYL,34kpjk,heychrisk,3,Sat May 2 23:22:26 2015 UTC,"1) I love the band and the song was real high energy, I wanted something exciting to get attention right from the start, and it was between this and some jpop nonsense. I made the right choice with what I picked.  2) EnterTAIN, dahling. Anyone can sit in front of a camera and reenact show tunes, but you have to keep me engaged throughout the entire process if you want me to give a shit for once in my miserable life. Personally I really love funny stuff, but I'm also super down to vote for someone who can sell it."
LSFYL,34kpjk,druidcandy,3,Sun May 3 02:45:04 2015 UTC,"Something else I thought of:  I think my biggest struggle (and this is just a problem I have in general) was that as the competition went on I got more and more focused on the technical aspect. Trying to get my sync as tight as it could and keeping everything focused and in frame. And while these are super important in a video (especially now that every bitch in the sub has a goddamn green screen), you have to remember to have fun. If you aren't having fun nobody watching you will."
LSFYL,34kpjk,theGstandsforGabriel,1 point,Wed May 6 16:10:47 2015 UTC,Fantastic advice - so thank you from me.  I have already caught myself getting bogged down in technicalities and I'm only working on intro and audition at the moment! I really had to pull back and Whoa myself.   And then you popped up with this. Great timing and great reminder!
LSFYL,34kpjk,dazeymayhem,2,Wed May 6 23:29:19 2015 UTC,"If you look at the top videos, often times the ones that got votes were just the most entertaining, with technical excellence being a plus rather than the deciding factor."
LSFYL,34kpjk,theGstandsforGabriel,1 point,Thu May 7 00:31:14 2015 UTC,"Very much so. And those have always been my faves as well. I guess it's just so tempting because I can cram all the tech crap into it - with the green screen and the effects and the this that and the other, I want to do so. But in recalling those that I liked the most, it was the performance - not the stuff - that won me over.   Same goes for actual drag performances as well. The most effective are not always the most flashy. I'll do well to remind myself of that."

LSFYL,34kpjk,dazeymayhem,3,Fri May 8 12:16:22 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't know if you've looked, but here's the thread from season 2's auditions  The auditions that made it through are: Garbanian, theharpervalleypta, zoomyx, GeminiGaga, dOrPanthera, joanwaters, theGstandsforGabriel, shutt_up, Babeford, Noahk519, MikiClash, and druidcandy.  You can get a sense of what they did above the others from watching that.  Other bits of advice: Get a good webcam.  If your webcam is laggy, even the tightest lip-sync can look choppy and off.  Film in a well-lit room if possible.  Costumes, props, and production values can help give you an edge (especially with the audition week), but they will NOT hold up a sloppy performance.  Make sure you practice your song and have it down.  However, it's not purely lip-syncing ability that will get you through.  You are performing, so even if your lips flawlessly hit every word, people want to be entertained.  Being able to tell a story or sell a strong concept can help both impress the voters, along with making it easier to get into the vibe of the song."
LSFYL,34kpjk,LSunday,2,Sat May 2 04:22:02 2015 UTC,"Choose a fun or unexpected song and pair it with mismatched lashes and a cheap wig.  If I were voting and not counting the votes, my vote would go to creative, kooky contestants with TIGHT syncs."

LSFYL,34kpjk,TheOneDoc,1 point,Thu May 7 14:17:10 2015 UTC,"I definitely felt like the straight man going into this competition (no pun intended), and compared to a lot of the big personalities I knew I needed to pull out something that showed that I could put on a show. I had a bunch of other song ideas in mind, but then my mom was watching ""Sister Act"" in the background one day and I just knew. You want to make sure that your song is going to help you stand out, but it's not enough to use a gimmick. We had a lot of great audition videos where people got hidden behind their props or ideas. Honestly, the audition video is important, but make sure that you get us in the intro video. Only one person got onto Season 2 without one, and for a lot of us that's where we set the tone for who we were and where we were coming from. So while you need to turn it in the actual sync, make sure you show us the real you. Because if your intro is five seconds long, it's going to get buried. It's a lot like RPDR where the pre-season is just as important as the first challenge. Get that buzz going."
LSFYL,34kpjk,theGstandsforGabriel,1 point,Mon May 4 02:31:54 2015 UTC,"One more thought, more for as the competition goes on:  This ain't Drag Race. We're not aiming for safe here. Everybody who votes picks a Top 3 for the week and the rest are all in the bottom. This means that the only way you make it to the next week is if you wow SOMEBODY. You don't need to impress the whole crowd. You just need to be unique enough that some people will put you on their list. Playing it safe is dangerous, because if you end up being everybody's 4th choice, you go home."
LSFYL,34kpjk,theGstandsforGabriel,0,Thu May 7 17:23:18 2015 UTC,"I chose my lipsync song based on something I thought I could do easily. I also didn't make it into the competition so I clearly had no good ideas. Last year, I voted for people who I thought entertained me and did something different. I often went against the crowd as well, trying to pick someone who was a wow for me."

LSFYL,33wq57,theGstandsforGabriel,11,Sun Apr 26 14:06:16 2015 UTC,"Reddit’s LSFYL Season 3 Rules and Regulations  SUBMISSIONS   Any individual may participate; no contestant will be turned away because of age, gender identity, or other personal factors. You are all fabulous. Videos must adhere at least vaguely to the week’s theme. Creative interpretations of the weekly theme are acceptable, though participants who take an unorthodox approach to the challenge may be asked to explain their choices. Videos must represent one continuous, uninterrupted take of the lip sync so that voters can judge the performer’s ability accurately. Dubbing sound after the fact is permitted, as are filters or other video effects that do not result from cutting or splicing the single take. Green screens may be used but sparingly and only with a single take performance. Outside help is permitted; non-contestants may hold the camera, provide lighting effects, move props, and even appear on camera provided that the contestant is the only person lip syncing. Videos may be uploaded to any service: YouTube, Vimeo, DailyMotion, etc.; links must be emailed by the posted deadline to msjoanwaters@gmail.com.    STRUCTURE   OPTIONAL: An “introduction” thread will be posted on June 1st. Contestants wishing to introduce themselves via video may submit a link by May 31st. Contestants who do not submit an introduction are still eligible to participate in the competition. Initial lip sync videos must be submitted by midnight Eastern Time on June 7th. The first post of the competition with be posted on the morning of June 8th. If the number of submissions is larger than 13, then the first round will eliminate all but the participants with the 13 highest scores, regardless of how many people submit. If there are 13 or fewer submissions, then the first round will perform only one elimination. In order to maintain fairness to the newest crop of hopefuls, no past contestants may compete. HOWEVER, if the first or second eliminated contestant from any season wishes to return, a spot will be reserved called THE SHANGELA SLOT. Those contestants will not be given a free pass, they must audition through the same process as all other new hopefuls and be voted in. If such a contestant does not emerge or doesn’t garner enough votes, THE SHANGELA SLOT may be allocated to a brand new contestant. Each Monday, a theme will be announced. Contestants who are not eliminated by audience vote (explained in more detail in the following section) will then have until midnight Eastern Time on the following Sunday to submit a video. Videos will be posted Monday morning. The process will continue with one contestant being eliminated each week until a Top 3 has been determined, at which point the audience will decide a winner. Variations to this process, including but not limited to double eliminations and the reinstating of previously eliminated contestants, may occur at the host’s discretion.   VOTING   Videos will be posted by 9am Eastern Time every Monday. Audience members will then have until 9am on THURSDAY to submit their votes. This deadline allows the contestants to know by Thursday whether they will be participating in the next round. The participant with the lowest number of votes will be eliminated from the competition. The participant with the highest total will be declared the week’s winner. Audience members will each receive THREE votes. Voters must rank their first, second, and third choice for the week. Each voter must submit three votes, and each vote must be for a different contestant. Voting is private and should not be shared in the discussion thread. While reviews and critiques are recommended, sharing of votes is discouraged. Votes must be submitted by email to msjoanwaters@gmail.com.  Votes that do not adhere to these rules will not be counted. REGARDING SOCIAL MEDIA: Promoting the competition on other social media outlets is strongly encouraged. The ranked voting system is intended to force voters to watch all of the videos, dissuading participants from simply soliciting votes. While it is impossible to prevent the game from becoming a popularity contest, best behavior is encouraged.   PRIZES   All prizes will be donated by the audience. People wishing to donate prizes for the winner, runner-up, third place, or Ms./Mr. Congeniality should email msjoanwaters@gmail.com to coordinate. The host will donate a crown to the winner of the contest. In addition, the host will purchase a month of Reddit Gold for the winner of each week’s challenge.   GOOD LUCK AND DON'T FUCK IT UP"

LSFYL,33wq57,UEH,7,Mon Apr 27 18:43:03 2015 UTC,I think that rule kinda goes without saying.

LSFYL,33wq57,Babeford,9,Mon Apr 27 00:18:15 2015 UTC,"While I agree it would be really fun to compete again (#BringBackBabz), I think it would take away from the other newbies who are going through this for the first time. They won't know how stressful it gets every week and aren't prepared, whereas someone like you or me would have that upper edge. It's a small advantage, but in the later rounds it would grow exponentially.    We had our time to shine, and there's no denying you'd be a fierce competitor again. There's talk of an All Stars (#Babz4AllStars) in the near future where you'd be more than welcome to participate in. I'd love to see more content from you.    This is just my two cents, trying to give a different, less angry perspective on where some users might be coming from. (#Babz4MissCongeniality#Again)"

LSFYL,33wq57,heychrisk,6,Mon Apr 27 00:21:08 2015 UTC,"I'll address this in detail later tonight. Currently on my sitcom set and shooting so I'm a bit tied up, kittens."
LSFYL,33wq57,Raven_Night,9,Mon Apr 27 00:38:18 2015 UTC,"Sorry, Joan. Looks like the drama is starting early this season! Hosting can be a lot of work, but I know you're up to it.   My one piece of advice for you is to remind yourself every day how very important the competition felt when you were part of it. Last season, I would sometimes come into a thread and think to myself, ""This? THIS is what we're choosing to freak out about?!"" I had to catch myself and remember never to view anyone's concerns as trivial. People invest in the game a million percent.  That said: it's still just a YouTube competition for a small prize and small amount of fame in a small corner of the internet, so don't put undue pressure on yourself. You got this.  Everyone else: please don't make this harder for Joan. She will be giving up more of her summer than she realizes to make sure that this contest runs smoothly, and we can thank her by not creating unnecessary problems. Counting to ten and rereading your message before you hit that ""save"" button can do a world of good."
LSFYL,33wq57,HeyHeather,3,Mon Apr 27 16:47:46 2015 UTC,"Why would you need to compete again? I'd get if you got eliminated first or had to drop out, but you made top three in Season 1. Give others a chance and get your head out of your ass."
LSFYL,33wq57,thelettergii,3,Mon Apr 27 00:50:40 2015 UTC,"I don't need to compete.  Nobody does.  This is for fun, and I like to have fun.  My head isn't in my ass... I just wanted to compete because I enjoy it.  But if everyone is going to have a problem and throw a hissy fit, then perhaps I will spare you all the unbearable agony of having the option to view a video I submit."
LSFYL,33wq57,HeyHeather,7,Mon Apr 27 01:18:53 2015 UTC,"I think if you want to do it for fun, it would be great to see you participate in the Carrion threads! They were pretty popular last season so I'm sure Joan will have them this season, and that'll be the best way for you to follow the themes without competing."
LSFYL,33wq57,TheOneDoc,3,Mon Apr 27 01:27:33 2015 UTC,"also, i wanted to compete in the side contests that happen through the year, but i just dont have time.  i have to work a lot and at odd hours so i dont have the luxury of steady schedule to make videos anymore.  i want to compete this summer because i will be in graduate school and have the focus and the space and the schedule to do it."
LSFYL,33wq57,HeyHeather,3,Mon Apr 27 02:16:09 2015 UTC,Honestly I loved the Carrion's almost more than the competition.  How about we add Carrion allstars?

LSFYL,33wq57,HeyHeather,2,Mon Apr 27 02:08:29 2015 UTC,"It's not just for fun, this is a competition. I feel like if we open it up to past contestants, especially ones who made Top 3, they're more than likely to get on as opposed to people who haven't gotten on before because they have a following of sort and the status of a seasoned veteran.   Like I said, I don't mind if it was 1.) A part contestant that had to leave for medical reasons or 2.) You were eliminated first."

LSFYL,33wq57,Babeford,1 point,Mon Apr 27 02:52:18 2015 UTC,"I'd be fine with a returnee as long as it fell under those two categories I listed. Like any who went home first or second would be fine, and again, someone who had to quit for reasons beyond their control.  But someone who was in top 3 should not get another chance. Even someone who was top 4 or 5 is pushing it a little but I'd be okay with."

But shit yes I'm going to throw a hissy fit because guess the fuck what? You had your chance, you had your time to shine so I'm damn pissed you would try and come in here and compete again.

It's bullshit that you've come on here to try and fucking re-enter the competition despite the fact that you made top 3 in Season 1. You do not deserve a chance in this competition and I'll be damned if I'm going to sit by and let you shit-talk a strong community of people I care about.

Those contestants will not be given a free pass, they must audition through the same process as all other new hopefuls and be voted in.

If such a contestant does not emerge or doesn’t garner enough votes, THE SHANGELA SLOT may be allocated to a brand new contestant.

LSFYL,33wq57,viqule,6,Mon Apr 27 11:37:06 2015 UTC,Just found this sub today.  This is gonna be fun to watch.
LSFYL,33wq57,thelettergii,2,Fri May 15 04:31:01 2015 UTC,"Isn't this usually done in the ""off"" season?"
LSFYL,33wq57,dipthonggirl,8,Sun Apr 26 23:30:45 2015 UTC,"By the time the actual competition starts it will be the off season, also drag race started late this year."
LSFYL,33wq57,thelettergii,4,Sun Apr 26 23:38:09 2015 UTC,"I'm trying real hard to make sure I can participate; I got completely screwed over on my summer plans, and if I can't work something out in the next couple of days I won't be able to participate. :("

LSFYL,33wq57,oath2order,3,Wed Apr 29 19:04:48 2015 UTC,...no bottom 2 lip sync for your lives?!?!...bummer...
LSFYL,33wq57,RhondaOdyssey,6,Mon Apr 27 00:13:10 2015 UTC,Putting together one sync per week is gonna be tough enough.
LSFYL,33wq57,viqule,3,Mon Apr 27 00:18:31 2015 UTC,EVERY LIP SYNC IS A LIP SYNC FOR YOUR LIFE

LSFYL,33wq57,LSunday,3,Thu Apr 30 16:19:50 2015 UTC,"I can't find the thread where you were asking people's opinions on what could be cool for season 3 but I think bringing back the Foreign language challenge would be would be killer..   Also, spoken word....definitely spoken word."
LSFYL,33wq57,Noahk519,1 point,Thu May 14 01:40:26 2015 UTC,I wonder if mash-ups would ever be a challenge
LSFYL,33wq57,theGstandsforGabriel,5,Sat May 16 03:07:08 2015 UTC,i'm not going to lie i feel a lot of pressure to do this but i can almost guarantee i will underwhelm
LSFYL,33wq57,cheerfulstate,2,Mon Apr 27 02:54:01 2015 UTC,"But you will overwhelm us with your awesomeness regardless, leaving us at least whelmed.  And then it'll be like you took us to Europe."
LSFYL,33wq57,theGstandsforGabriel,2,Mon Apr 27 13:35:40 2015 UTC,Hey!   Do you know the rough time frame of the comp? I'm going to be travelling a bit in the middle of the year...uh oh...
LSFYL,33wq57,cheerfulstate,5,Wed Apr 29 13:14:42 2015 UTC,"If the auditions are on June 8th, we'll have 13 people and start the season on June 15th.  If there is 1 elimination per week, with no double or non-eliminations, the videos for the final three will get posted on Monday, August 24th."

LSFYL,33wq57,Noahk519,2,Wed Apr 29 16:39:40 2015 UTC,"Noah, we need to do a mini cooking show where we both try to make a pie with no recipe and while drunk."

LSFYL,32elh7,seamusocoffey,4,Mon Apr 13 03:50:52 2015 UTC,Seamus should be Season Three's Halleloo Hex.    After this I'd be okay seeing him pop out of a box for redemption.

LSFYL,31oxul,TheHarperValleyPTA,5,Tue Apr 7 00:28:51 2015 UTC,"hiee i've lurked a bit here and i have to say i'm quite interested in doing this! i was wondering if we could use foreign language ones, because i want to do a filipino one (seeing as it is my mother tongue along with english). would that be possible?"
LSFYL,31oxul,superwonkyeyelash,3,Fri Apr 17 11:43:03 2015 UTC,I'm gagging and most of it is nausea from watching that old video of me.
LSFYL,31oxul,joanwaters,3,Wed Apr 8 03:22:52 2015 UTC,"The first time 'vintage Joan Waters classic' wasn't used to describe a 10 year old cache of boxed wine.   This is a great challenge, spoken word is awesome and we need more of it!"
LSFYL,31oxul,BitchEva,2,Tue Apr 7 00:30:07 2015 UTC,I had so much fun doing my Anaconda video that I figured I'd make that fun mandatory for everyone else
LSFYL,31oxul,EdieCentric,2,Tue Apr 7 00:31:09 2015 UTC,This challenge is HEAVEN.   Could one possibly spice different dialogue together or does it have to be from one continuos scene?
LSFYL,31oxul,EdieCentric,2,Tue Apr 7 01:09:17 2015 UTC,"I imagined it as doing one scene, but I think I'll leave it up to however people want to do it"
LSFYL,31oxul,LSunday,1 point,Tue Apr 7 01:11:19 2015 UTC,Sweet…can't WAIT!
LSFYL,31oxul,LSunday,1 point,Tue Apr 7 04:00:32 2015 UTC,"A few questions:  Radio drama- yes or no?  Stage play, same question.  Also, if we want to do something such as Dr. Horrible, could we include a song as part of it as long as it also includes the spoken word for a majority of it?"
LSFYL,31oxul,LSunday,5,Tue Apr 7 04:11:32 2015 UTC,"(Side note, 3 minutes is actually super long.  Most people are gonna want to do comedy, and comedic scenes tend to air on the shorter side.  I've gone through 4 perfect scenes already that are clocking in at around 2 and half, and I was looking for long ones.)"
LSFYL,31oxul,starlightzone,2,Tue Apr 7 04:55:01 2015 UTC,"you're telling me that in the entire library of film and television scenes you can't find something funny that's longer than three minutes? or, better yet, a serious scene that could be made hilarious through your interpretation of the dialogue?"
LSFYL,31oxul,dazeymayhem,4,Tue Apr 7 05:23:46 2015 UTC,"We already had this discussion, but I just feel that you're eliminating more scenes that would be good for this challenge than ones that would be boring."
LSFYL,31oxul,dazeymayhem,2,Tue Apr 7 05:28:20 2015 UTC,"I'm sure I'm eliminating some good videos, but this is also meant to be a challenge. There are still plenty of good scenes to choose from, and I'm sure you'll find something."
LSFYL,31oxul,TheOneDoc,2,Tue Apr 7 05:34:12 2015 UTC,"I think as long as the spoken word portion is the majority of the video it should be fine. Radio dramas and stage plays are fine, too, as long as you have usable audio and at least two characters."
LSFYL,31oxul,EdieCentric,1 point,Tue Apr 7 05:18:41 2015 UTC,"Just in case I can break free this time, are Let's Plays and Internet Videos free game too?"
LSFYL,31oxul,dipthonggirl,2,Tue Apr 7 05:14:07 2015 UTC,"eh, I'd prefer if people stuck to tv shows/movies/plays but I'm open to whatever people choose to do. as long as it meets character and length requirements and is spoken word I'm pretty much okay with it."
LSFYL,31oxul,KHRoxas,1 point,Tue Apr 7 05:20:09 2015 UTC,Longtime lurker but virgin participator here - is there a list of rules/how-to for newbies? I did hunt for one (I promise) but can't seem to find anything. Would love to begin joining y'all.
LSFYL,31oxul,EdieCentric,1 point,Wed Apr 8 21:52:21 2015 UTC,"It's really easy! Record yourself Lip syncing a song, overlay the music (let me know if you need help with this), upload it to youtube, and message the link to whoever is hosting the challenge! The winner of the challenge will get to host the next one. The host is responsible for coming up with a theme, setting deadlines, and collecting votes. Generally, all videos need to be done in one take, but this week is a little different. Really, there aren't any major rules! Just about everything else comes down to a matter of taste and style. Let me know if you need help it have other questions, it's always nice to have new people!!!"

LSFYL,2yp3pj,axelknight0717,3,Wed Mar 11 17:18:31 2015 UTC,"I like that you sync for fun. That's important, because that's what it's about, after all. I liked the idea of collaborating with someone else for a video - it's a super cute idea. Your transitions back and forth between you and your friend were very clean.  That being said, I really don't think this is one of your best. The audio was not synced accurately, which left you mouthing words that didn't match up to the music. Also, while collaborating with your friend was a sweet idea, the difference in your styles (and timings) made the audio syncing issues all the more evident.  You are really talented, Axel. Work on honing your skills, because your talent is worth that work."
LSFYL,2yp3pj,mtd1988,2,Thu Mar 12 01:53:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks! And I know!!! I really messed up for like a minute! I kept trying to fix it but it just wasn't working! But then again, it's the first time I do this type of video so I guess it wasn't THAT bad! Just ""...eh..."" Lol!"
LSFYL,2yp3pj,mtd1988,3,Thu Mar 12 02:29:59 2015 UTC,"It wasn't BAD, dude! I could tell that it was a production issue vs. a ""you totally didn't know the words"" issue. Experimentation is fun. Your next collaboration, you'll know what to do to perfect it. :)  Also, come to the TC sometime so people can get to know you!"
LSFYL,2yp3pj,thelettergii,1 point,Thu Mar 12 02:36:51 2015 UTC,"This was actually pretty amusing to watch! Glad someone did a collab video for once!  It seemed like you were a little awkward with your movements which is surprising because normally you have a solid grasp on your moves. Your friend also was kind of mumbling so maybe you could teach them about enunciation a little bit. But other than that, keep it up!"

LSFYL,2yaviy,GeminiGaga,2,Sun Mar 8 02:47:30 2015 UTC,"I think I honestly like this more than your first live performance, probably because I love your outfit and it matches the song great. Tiny nitpicky crit: you're pushing your wig back a lot, perhaps hairspray it so that it doesn't get in your face? Other than that this was great, I wish I could've seen a front view!"
LSFYL,2yaviy,thelettergii,2,Tue Mar 10 04:45:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I really need a wig that stays out of my face. When you're way up high and everyone is so low and you want to make eye contact, it's hard with a wig like that! lol. & I wish it was from the front too but not many of my friends could make it so, at least some video was better than none. lol"

LSFYL,2xm0nd,TheHarperValleyPTA,7,Sun Mar 1 23:37:54 2015 UTC,"buttons up shirt before writing reviews  Roxas: Masterpiece. Best work yet. I have no words.  Dip: That is...really big. Um. I love your new hair color and I love the color of that...that. This was a silly fun video with a simple gimmick, and a perfect ending. I think that's your shtick, simple silly videos. I would love to see you amp up the entertainment factor! Like, take your gimmick and go overboard with it, cause I think you could totally do more with that...that thing.  Zoom: I'm so happy to see you do a song in French! The song is catchy too, and although your camera is a little blurry I think you lipsynced very well. I get that the intro/ending was supposed to be overly dramatic, but the intro did run a little long for me and I feel like it could have been paced faster. I do love your look and I live for your yarn wigs, always.  Mikey: LMAO SHADE. I love impersonations, and every detail was on point: the hair, the earbuds, the mason jar!! The Sesame Street tank!! EVERYTHING!!!!! The only thing is that I wish you brought more energy to the song, because this is a very high-energy song. Even if you're just sitting there, you could amp up the sass. I don't know if the lowkey energy was part of your impersonation, but I did feel like you could have moved a little more. Still though, I'M CRYING  Gii: Who dat  Pierre: First off, I'm so glad to see you submit a video because I live for your Snaps! I know you weren't 100% satisfied with this take, but I think you're an extremely energetic and passionate person and even if you're not at your best, you're still amazing. I love this video, it's one of my favorites this week. You brought the sass, the energy, and you even had your funny moments. Seriously great job, please do more videos!  Eva: The debut of everyone's favorite shitstain, Cherry Pop. Love your color coordination, and it's so nice to see this cute and fun side of you when in reality you're this horrible hateful excuse for a human being. Also, LIPSTICK! Keep playing around with makeup, you look gorgeous in this video. I will say that you should look into saving for a better camera with a higher frame rate if you're considering Season 3, because this webcam isn't capturing a lot of your movements and your lipsyncing.   Joan: I love watching you evolve post-LSFYL, your makeup is so different from when you first auditioned and I love seeing you experiment with different looks. The chocolate syrup was EVERYTHING. It's just so fun to watch you lipsync. I kind of wish you filmed in landscape mode instead of portrait, I know you had the not-really-milkshakes in the borders but portrait mode in YouTube is just a pet peeve of mine. But god I still can't believe you drizzled the chocolate perfectly, it looks so fucking artistic #yokoono  Druid: Not really a fan of this song, but you're working the lyrics and I'll commend you for that. As with Joan, your makeup has come a long way since you joined LSFYL and I'm so glad that we get to watch you grow. I also really appreciate that you try to do fun syncs whenever you can, even on top of TDR. You've got the performance factor of a drag queen, you just need the makeup skills. But that just takes practice. Not all drag queens are born performers. Keep it up man, we're all rooting for you with love <3  Sunday: Three drag queens in a row! I think this is the best you've looked, honestly. I love your outfit, that jacket is so well-tailored. It fits you really well and gives you that feminine shape. This was definitely more of an old-fashioned type of vulgar, not as vulgar as the other videos here, and I wish you had done a little more with that. The striptease was something, but I wasn't impressed by the reveal...maybe you could have rhinestoned the bra? Either something flashy underneath, OR you could have poked fun at the old-fashioned stereotypes of sluttiness, with flashing shoulders and ankles and whatnot.  UEH: This song has been stuck in my head since you first posted the video. I know you're known for like, simple videos with dance moves, but somehow I enjoyed this video more than your past ones. I think usually you vogue a lot, but this time you kept that for a small portion and you focused more on your expressions. Two things: I wish you turned on the lights, and I wasn't a big fan of your makeup. I know you just decided to stop halfway through painting and film, but I think just adding eyeliner would really have improved your look. Liner and lashes, maybe.   Leafy: Okay, this was hilarious. How did you submit this so early?! It looks like editing would have taken forever! I watched this several times so I could make sure I caught everyone's faces. Honestly, the fact that you did this in multiple takes doesn't bother me that much. However, I think you could have lipsynced during the chorus parts. Even though I live for your faces, it did feel like half the video was you making faces and not you lipsyncing. (ALSO WHY DID YOU PICK THE HOOPS VIDEO I HATE THAT ONE UGH)  Stark: That stubble is seriously convincing, I have no clue how you've been doing it. I feel like whenever you post a video everyone's always like ""OMG Stark posted a video, I wish he'd do more!"" except you HAVE been doing more, it's just that we can't get enough. Love your expressions, always. I actually feel like this song could have done with some more prop use, bringing out your laptop at the end was a nice touch but I could totally have seen you fawning over photographs and stuff!   I am really impressed this week, and I have no clue who I'm going to vote for. Like, every video was good in some way. Great job everyone, glad to see the challenges riling up again!"

LSFYL,2xm0nd,viqule,4,Thu Mar 5 21:28:50 2015 UTC,"if gii's the only other person doing reviews then I have a moral obligation to provide a balanced, opposite viewpoint.   Roxas: When I was a young woman living in German-occupied Poland, I could often be found making deliveries to the elderly and the wounded living in the Jewish ghettoes. In times of great strife, we were forced to band together, even the least empathetic of us gave up something to help the community at large. I myself made many trips, back and forth from the bakery I worked at, to deliver what little I could to those in need.   One of my most common stops was Mrs. Wladislaw, an elderly woman who lived by herself. What I knew of her was that her family comprised of herself, her husband, and her adult sons, before the war at least. I never asked how she came to live on her own, but in these times there was not much chance that there was a positive reason. Still, she always seemed to exude a strength and a quiet dignity that I kept close to my heart. It gave me strength in times when I wanted to give up. She was a strong woman surviving in trying times.   And she never looked half as pouty as you do here.   Dip: I liked the idea behind the video, but I wanted you to commit more and sell the zaniness. You seem to hold back a lot, which everyone does to begin with. But you need to let that go in order to really capitalize on your personality.   Zoom: Between the intro and the outro, it felt like the actual sync was a tiny part of the video itself. Which is a shame because I liked the sync, it was a cute song with dirty lyrics and you sold it appropriately. Doing a foreign song always has risks but it is a language you know, which definitely came across.   Mikey: I dislike the song, so I'm already at a disadvantage here, but I felt like the energy could've been much higher. Impersonation is always fun, but I feel that besides the song, the video didn't fit Cheer that much. There's a lot that someone of your creativity can do, I don't feel like this matched that potential.   Eleanor of Aquitaine: A Medieval noblewoman, notable for being queen of two kingdoms, as well as a duchess in her own right. Arguably the most powerful and wealthiest woman of her time, she was a patron of the arts and the church. Famously portrayed by Katharine Hepburn in the film The Lion of Winter.   Pierreeeeeee: I still don't like this song but you gave me movement, energy, and face. I enjoyed this just because it's something that we need sometimes: a lipsync that is pure fun. I absolutely want to see more of these.   Joanie: Classic Joan, pretty much. The expressions, the insanity, it's all there. You don't fix what isn't broken, though if someone had told me you were submitting I would've expected a much filthier song from someone like you.   Druid: o miss cc  LSunday: I agree with Gii (which causes me physical pain to type), this is the best your makeup has ever been. I liked the striptease element, but I didn't feel sexiness from it. It came across as just playing at the idea of a striptease rather than just going for one.   UEH: I think it's actually quite an accomplishment to have such a samey song not be completely boring by the end, so to pull that off is a high mark. That said, this is a long video, the kind that's hard to rewatch just because of it. Zoom's was shorter with a minute-long intro and an outro. I enjoyed the performance a lot but by the end I was ready to be done.   Leafy: One of the best videos submitted but not my favorite sync. I enjoyed pretty much the whole thing, and I seriously applaud the editing work. It was a blast seeing all the various SR people pop up  one by one. This is another kind of video I'd really like to see more of.   StarkFinn: I had to rewatch for a critique because my first reaction was just excitement that you submitted a video. What I enjoy about your way of performing is that despite making a convincing male illusion, you retain femininity in some of your movements which weirdly adds something very watchable to them. The ending was also probably one of my favorite moments of this week."

LSFYL,2xgfc7,axelknight0717,4,Sat Feb 28 12:25:27 2015 UTC,"Did it work? Short answer: No.  It was very hard to understand the concept for this sync. I get that anything being held in your hand was eventually ""let go"" but there really was nothing humorous about it.  You hit all of the words (which is great), but the effects and having the lyrics onscreen detracted from your performance and drew attention away from the thing that matters most: YOU.  Bells and whistles and effects are great, but they are pointless if they takes away from the overall success of your video.  You are a ""diamond-in-the-rough,"" Axel. You're very expressive and can hit lyrics well. You have grown a lot from your first video and you are receptive to criticism. All of these things are excellent qualities in a performer.

I also like that you didn't try and mop moves/the interpretation from any other material. I like you best when you're showing your originality.  If you're going to incorporate clapping into your video, don't just mime it because it comes off looking cheesy. Also, your dance moves, while fun, were pretty repetitive. Don't be afraid to mix it up a little bit.  Again, be careful with camera effects - make sure you're using them to ENHANCE your video, rather than just throwing them in because you can."

LSFYL,2thkyh,thelettergii,4,Mon Jan 26 01:29:23 2015 UTC,"I feel weird talking about challenge themes because I haven't even competed, so...my only request is that we get new themes, cool themes, unique themes, themes that aren't just [genre] week or [decade] week! Repeats are okay too if they've been repeated before, maybe.   I'd honestly prefer not having double eliminations unless that's just how things happen to end up, like with votes or whatever. I think the number of contestants you had in Season 2 is good enough for Season 3, and I'm okay with starting at the same time of the year.  Piggybacking on Harper's bottom two suggestion, I think as long as the additional lipsync is clearly required to be something more bare-bones then it won't be as time-consuming as I'm worried it could be. Maybe they have to lipsync in the same costume/setting that you filmed your challenge video in, sort of like the LSFYLs on Drag Race.  Compliments: Loved having 3 votes, would maybe extend it to 5 only for audition week and only if there are a ton. Loved the intro and results videos, the format was very organized and clean. I think continuing with the Season 2 format for the most part would be a good idea. I also think you'll be a damn good host. Not as good as Moose but hey, we can't all be Moose.

What I've come up with is that themes that dictate what the songs are about or mention are the least successful. This is probably because themes like ""Heat,"" ""Fashion,"" and ""Dark"" severely limit the songs that contestants can choose (whereas themes based on Genres, Years, or Artists have far more options).   One of the most interesting (to me) is the idea of who chooses the song. Obviously, there's Queen's Choice at the beginning of the season, but we've also had a ""competitor's choice"" of sorts (Redo! and Season 2 Superiority), and then audience choice (Songs from the Hat). I think for sure the idea of competitor's choice should be developed (not just as a ""do it better!"" theme), and then Songs from the Hat...well, I would say eliminated and built from the ground up, but I'm also the only one who really enjoyed this year's method. I also honestly feel like there could be a Host's choice, because you fucking won, you motherfucking goddess, but Host's Choice will probably end up with the most amount of vitriol spat around the tinychat, so maybe don't."

LSFYL,2thkyh,thelettergii,3,Sun Jan 25 01:02:11 2015 UTC,"Get more contestants (maybe 3 or 4 more) in this bitch. And do a double elimination or two. Starting a week or two earlier could work.  We need a ""Take You To Church"" week. R&B/Motown songs that will bring some soul out.  Dark Week was a particular favorite one of mine, and one I wish we had seen earlier on in the competition, so we could have seen more ""dark"" videos. I'm all for that making a comeback.  I will echo the sentiment of the final videos not being a RuPaul song, at this point. Syncer's choice will give us the best final videos.  I understand Harper's sentiment behind doing two videos a week, but doing two videos a week will probably burn everyone out WAY faster.  If you wanted to make things a bit more balanced, you could implement a points system, and the person(s) with the lowest points (cumulative, I guess) would be voted out. (First place gets 14 points, Second gets 13... and so on).  I'm a monster, but I like Songs from a Hat week - but it needs to be handled fairly. As in, not who gets the most votes, but a genuinely random choice for each participant. Promote the crap out of this early on! Cast that wider net for more hopeful contestants.. to face the eventual bloodbath."
LSFYL,2thkyh,mtd1988,2,Sat Jan 24 21:44:09 2015 UTC,"I agree about Songs from a Hat week, but I'm not so sure about the cumulative thing. I think a lot of the suspense comes from not knowing if your favorite contestants might get eliminated that week...also, if someone was doing extremely well in the beginning, they might see it as an opportunity to coast in later challenges (not intentionally, but if real life issues happen and stuff), and there's a risk of seeing less entertaining videos because of that."

LSFYL,2thkyh,theGstandsforGabriel,3,Sun Jan 25 19:10:01 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of what people are getting at with their concerns about some of the past themes is: what's the logic behind them? Why are the contestants being asked to do this? Dark Week, for instance, was particularly successful because we had seen a lot of campy stuff and it overtly challenged everyone to do something new. Speed Rap is successful because it forces people to prove that they can work those lips quickly. I'll freely admit that I was haphazard in choosing some of the themes, and I love that you're doing this planning in advance. Looking back, I think what I was missing sometimes was a rationale for each week's theme: why it was important, what it meant to the competition, what it pushed the contestants to achieve. If I could do it over, I'd think more about how to make each week test a different aspect of people's skills."

Of course, being too restrictive also had its drawbacks: people were really unhappy with the ""songs from the past six months"" idea.

LSFYL,2thkyh,axelknight0717,5,Sun Jan 25 08:39:17 2015 UTC,"More gifs. I find it really hard to focus on what you're saying otherwise. Challenge-wise, I'd like to see more challenges that focus on genre. Like, I enjoyed the more meta-challenges of S2, but they got to be a little ambiguous at times, and I think that giving us a few weeks of ""Country Queen Realness"" or ""Rocker Chicks"" would give us a nice way, even if it's early on, to squeeze out a little bit of that versatility thing people keep telling me to get. 13 contestants was alright, but with our double elimination it seemed a little short. If we did start earlier, I think 14 would be a good number to shoot for. Harper's for-reals Lip Sync idea would be sort of cool, but I'm not sure about how to put it into practice. On the one hand, it'd be a nice way to end out the week, but on the other hand it's hard enough to get one good sync together in a week, and I know from my perspective I often only had one day out of the week free for filming, which would have kept me from doing that if I were in bottom two. In addition, if the bottom-two lipsync comes down to people voting, I'd be afraid of that. My favorite thing about this competition is that we vote for our favorites, so even at the Top 4 or whatever we're never specifically voting to send anybody home. If we did a bottom-2 lipsync, I feel like things could get real shady real fast. I like the voting as is, with the top 3 choices. It helps those of us without any friends last a little longer. Only thing I might consider (and this would really just be from a data perspective) is how to weight those votes. Like, I know Ariel ranked them so that first place got more votes, but I'd be interested to see if the results would have been any different had everybody put in their top 3 unranked. Bitch do a musical week gaht demmit. I wanna see something other than RuPaul for the finale as well. I'd say make the Top 3 do a Joan Waters song, but that album ain't dropped yet. I know that as I went on in the competition there were lots of things that I would have wanted to do that never quite fit the theme. It might be cool for the top 3 to be given free reign to do their absolute best sync, the one they spend the whole competition preparing for. Songs from a Hat. I like it but not the way it was done last time. I'd want it to be random, even if I'm still working on my ""The G Stands for Gutbucket Bottom"" lipsync. People can vote for the 4 songs, but it should be random who gets them."
LSFYL,2thkyh,mtd1988,2,Sat Jan 24 23:06:14 2015 UTC,I feel the top 3 doing a Rupaul song is kind of tradition! But I think the top 4 should do whatever song they want! To really show that they deserve to be in the top 3
LSFYL,2thkyh,thelettergii,3,Sun Jan 25 00:48:32 2015 UTC,"I disagree completely. If anything should remain due to ""tradition,"" it should be ""From A Hat,"" but even that should be retooled from last season."

Maybe Artist from a Hat, or the contestants get a list of the suggestions and choose from that list.  Basically, it's an appropriate level of difficulty for the top 4, but it's current iteration isn't FUN enough.  4) The final challenge should be revamped.  As much as we all love Rupaul, Rupaul songs are not good for a one-take lip-sync on youtube, ESPECIALLY for an explosive finale.  5) That guy who did the reviews last season with their drag persona?

I know we've talked about this a little bit, but I would love it if contestants went into each week knowing that in the event they land in the bottom two, they would have to lip sync to save themselves. The song could be provided during the theme announcement. I think this would be a good way of preventing people from sashaying away before their time due to voting flukes (cough babeford cough), and add a bit more drama to the competition.   I didn't have a problem with any of the challenges this season, but I think in the future I think it would be good to have expectations that are not so ambiguous, but still pretty open ended in regards to what songs could be performed. I felt like there was a lot of ""would this count? can I do this?"" going on in season 2, even though a lot of the themes were interesting and left a lot of choices available to contestants. So, whatever you do I would just try to make it clear what is or is not accepted.   the challenge I'm gonna campaign for would be a snatch game challenge. I think shutt werking it as Janis Joplin would be the perfect example of what I'm looking for. Pick an artist and impersonate them during your performance!   I liked 12 contestants. If the competition was any longer I think I would have gone insane. I think if you add more contestants, just make sure you do a few double eliminations because by the end I think we were all dragging a little bit (and not in the good way)!"

LSFYL,2thkyh,Zoomyx,2,Tue Jan 27 06:07:12 2015 UTC,"I dont know how everyone would respond to this idea... I imagine pitchforks and lit torches. But I think this competition has quickly grown into more than just lipsyncing. So I suggest a new voting system where perhaps you rate 1-10 every contestant in the categories of Lipsyncing, Overall Entertainment, (maybe some other categories but definitely those two), tabulate the scores in some mathy way and eliminate the person who scored the lowest- This way you can't necessarily cruise through on a halfass lipsync just because you had 10000 props, a greenscreen and other things that have nothing to do with the lipsync itself."
LSFYL,2thkyh,TheHarperValleyPTA,5,Sun Feb 15 02:43:23 2015 UTC,"I just saw this because it got stickied and this is going to be an essay oops I'm sorry  While I feel that this would be a great policy if the competition was run by a panel of judges, I disagree with implementing this for popular voting. It's a little time consuming and complicated for the average spectator/voter, but moreover I think this would significantly lower the morale of whoever placed in the bottom 3. With the current system there's a little more room for imagination, whereas with this method I think whoever was eliminated that week would feel pretty shitty about being ranked the lowest by everyone.  But ultimately this points to a discussion that the sub should really be having, on the idea of technique vs entertainment. Personally I don't believe there needs to be separation between the two. To me, a good lipsync performance should have good technique AND a good performance, and that performance factor comes from how entertaining it is. Just as you can have a halfass lipsync with 10000 props, you can also have an boring lipsync even though they nail every word. It goes both ways.   One could argue that a drag performance doesn't need props or greenscreens, but props and greenscreens aren't the only things that factor into entertainment for me. A drag performance isn't just about the lipsync, it's about the paint and the outfit and the movements. I'm more likely to be interested in a drag queen who can paint AND lipsync, as oppose to a drag queen who can lipsync but doesn't have the right makeup skills. Dragging up takes hours and so does making props or editing a greenscreen, so I don't really see the difference between them when it comes to a valid lipsync performance. I mean, obviously you might not be able to have a greenscreen on stage, but this isn't a stage competition. It's a video competition, and personally I think people should make the best of that medium.  I'm not trying to attack you, and I apologize if I come off that way. I honestly, completely understand where you are coming from; I did host Basic Week, after all. I just wanted to give you insight on the other point of view, it's something I've been thinking about for a while. What I really like about this subreddit is that there isn't really a preference for one or the other. It might seem like it because Season 2 was when all the editing started coming in, but editing doesn't necessarily mean a win or even a high. We've had winning videos that had lots of editing, but we've also had winning videos that are beautiful in their simplicity. You yourself beat 32 contestants to make it to the Top 4. That should say something! A good lipsync isn't good just because it's got a shitton of props. A good lipsync isn't good just because you know all the words. It's good because it's fucking good."
LSFYL,2thkyh,Garbanian,3,Tue Mar 10 00:06:01 2015 UTC,"I understand both sides of the coin or whatever for sure. And it's an interesting conversation and obviously different people are going to have different opinions and it's been that way. But I am not offended, you have good points too. :)"
LSFYL,2thkyh,thelettergii,2,Tue Mar 10 02:50:06 2015 UTC,"I feel like this is at least a little bit directed at me, so I will say how I feel. I disagree with this. This is a lipsync competition yes, but more than that, this is a competition where we want people to vote for us because they are ENTERTAINED. Babz did this by dancing, i did this by using props, harper used effect, and even if dont seem to aknowledge this, you did this with your look. You said once in a comment that this was more to you than only a lipsync competition: it was also a way to get better at drag. Ir espect that: but i dont see how putting a wig and makeup is ANY different than having a paper saying ""Ueh is bald"". This is NOT only about lipsyncing.  Should we also ban drags because dome people don't want to put makeup on? Sould we all lip sync in t-shirt in portrait mode? Should we zoom on th lips only and never check the rest of the body? Should we ban social media, becaus esome people tell their family to vote for them while other doesnt?  The one think that should never change imo is the one take, because we have to lipsync. I probably got some votes only because I had funny props, but I can GUARANTEE you that you also got votes only because you were doing drag. This competition is more than a lip snc competition. It's a way to express ourself, entertain other people and learn more about our passion. If we were all limiting ourself to only lipsyncing, then this would be a boring ass competition.  I earned my top 3 place. I never told any of my friend about this competition, all the votes i received were from people on this subreddit, and I never cruised on a halfass lipsync because i had 10000 props. Saying that people only got by because they used prop when you used another way to make your video more entertaining is hipocritical imo.  Have a good night :)"
LSFYL,2thkyh,Garbanian,4,Tue Mar 10 03:48:34 2015 UTC,"edit: gii said everything I wanted to say a lot more nicely than I did. I just don't feel that there's any good reason why anyone should come for props or technology. They aren't enough to magically turn a shitty sync into a good sync. It's fine if you don't want to use them, but it's really unfair to say that those who do use them are getting by solely because of them. I don't expect everyone to use tools like that, but I'm not going to feel bad about using everything at my disposal to make a good, entertaining video. That's what we are all trying to do, isn't it?"
LSFYL,2thkyh,Zoomyx,2,Mon Mar 9 23:42:53 2015 UTC,"I agree with a happy medium between the two. I agree this shouldn't be about each lip sync being a production (as entertaining as they are) since it is a lip sync competition, some sort of production value needs to be added to make it a worth while video. In the end these are competitions about a good lip sync, which is for a lip sync competition. I'd enter a much different competition if I wanted to be critiqued on my green screen, or props. While I don't mind them in videos, I don't think that a perfect lip sync should be valued less because it has no props, or editing. Ya know? Where is the happy middle ground, and where can we draw the VERY fine line? That's the toughest part about this, and that's why people get into these situations. Both sides look at each other and claim to be more correct than the other. Harper does AMAZEBALLS work with her editing, props, etc, and Gemini does prefer her lip syncs to be raw, as do I. There is no reason that we cannot have both involved. No reason at all. It's just a very tough thing to mediate.    On that note, I'll run off and never be seen once more from this subreddit! <3    EDIT: Should have posted this to the main post, not yours Harper. Whoops! I know how to reddit REAL good."
LSFYL,2thkyh,Garbanian,3,Tue Mar 10 02:53:08 2015 UTC,"(Assuming this is replying to me lol)  Honestly I think your audition is one of the best examples of a good lipsync on the sub: you nail the words, but you also pull off a killer look. I swear I'm not just kissing your ass, everyone on the sub agrees with me.  As for the fine line, I think that's up to each individual person to decide where they stand. We all have different tastes in songs and aesthetics and I don't think one person or group of people should decide where the line is for others. I'm all for the happy medium league though :D  (Also PLEASE COME BACK but only when you feel like it but I MISS YOU!)"
LSFYL,2thkyh,Zoomyx,2,Tue Mar 10 02:59:27 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what the issue is. Each person has their own taste and what they think the line should be. But there needs to be a solid line made by the mods of this subreddit to determine how this will progress. Until something is firm and in place, debates and issues will come up about props/video editing vs not. Ya know?    P.S. - I still hate all my videos, but love you for loving them <3!!!"
LSFYL,2thkyh,Garbanian,4,Tue Mar 10 03:12:12 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why we need to draw a solid line. I honetly dont get what is the difference between someone putting make up on and someone using props? Both are things that are used to enchance the quality of a video. In my honest opinion, the only rule should be that you need to do one take. I don't get why props and editing are a problem, and I would really like to know. Why are props put in a different category than dance and look?"
LSFYL,2thkyh,Zoomyx,1 point,Wed Mar 11 06:38:51 2015 UTC,"Because they are not you. Point blank. That's my opinion. That's why I don't post here. You've already said it once, that because I had a plain background you didn't like my video. Why should me NOT having props impact my video? It works both ways dear. I'm out. I have SOOOO much more I can worry about <3"
LSFYL,2thkyh,GeminiGaga,3,Wed Mar 11 06:47:19 2015 UTC,""" I liked your last video better, but this one wasn't bad in any mean. You're probably the strongest lip syncer in this comp technically (a tie with joan imo). The background didn't do it for me, but I'm not afraid for you: there's no way you don't make top 12 :) ""  This is the comment you're talking about? Because I don't see how you can say I didn't like your video from that comment. I didn't dislike the background because it was plain, on the contrary: i disliked it because it had stuff that was distracting. I would have had no problem with a white wall.   I said many times to many different people that I thought you were gonna win after week one, so I have no idea why you say I disliked your video. The comment was mostly positive and I said you were the strongest lip syncer in this comp: clearly I recognize the quality of your work and I never said that you not using props was a bad thing. Please don’t accuse me of things I didn’t do and mix things up. I like your videos, not because you use props / don’t use props. But because you are entertaining.   You say that it goes both ways, but I don’t understand. I never told anyone to use props. I may feel like some lipsyncs could be more entertaining (MINE INCLUDED), but that doesn’t means I want them to add props."
LSFYL,2thkyh,starlightzone,1 point,Wed Mar 11 07:15:12 2015 UTC,"You've nailed it dear. You've said it yourself now twice that there was an issue with backgrounds. I apologize for not going back and looking at the exact comment seeing as I'm on my phone without internet for the past hour or so. You brought up my background in my video when it had nothing to do with my lip sync. I've never once said there should be no props, green screens etc, but at some point someone has to stop and say this is too much for a lip sync video. Once again. Lip sync video. Whatever the mods decide, they decide. But serious talk this time. I'm out. My opinions been stated. I would personally like to see some sort of rule for excessive editing and prop usage. Now I'll be on my way to the unsubscribe button and y'all truly enjoy what you're all doing. Its great :-) I'll see whatever videos make it to Facebook through the few that I have as friends there."

LSFYL,2thkyh,viqule,2,Sun Feb 15 15:31:34 2015 UTC,"Well, everyone should be watching all the videos anyways if they're going to vote, so I don't think its too much to rank every contestant.

I think the exact rules of it can change, but it's like a makeover challenge; the exact theming of it changes every season, but it's the same thing.  Potential variations on it:  Songs someone's been eliminated with.  Songs someone's won with.  Songs from the off-season challenges.  Songs posted on the reddit for NO challenge.  Carrion songs.  Audition songs that didn't make it.  Plus, of course, the two variations we've already done:  Songs other competitors have done this season.  Songs that were done in the previous season."

LSFYL,2thkyh,axelknight0717,1 point,Tue Feb 10 02:52:34 2015 UTC,"I'm like gii in that this is weird/undeserving to ask for stuff when I haven't competed yet, but as a viewer person, there's a couple things I'll be hoping you'll consider :).  -- Be careful about themes like Fashion Week where there is almost too much ambiguity in which choices count toward the theme. The best themes seem to have been ones where there were plenty of song options while still having a clear-cut understanding about which songs fit the mold.  -- It would be rad to see more genre themes, like Motown, etc., so that we get to see the versatility of the artists.   -- Likewise, I think with gii's ""Basic Week"", I think there is some merit in technique-based themes (like minimalism week, etc)  -- While it caused a slight controversy, I think you should still get the chance to choose someone as a judge's wild card. If they aren't good the week after, the public will remove them. Much like what Agent mentioned, having a double elimination the week after would make sure that whoever did survive the audition bloodbath would give it all they has when round 2 began.  -- There needs to be some form of protocol for if we have two people tie for the bottom again, especially if it happens in the later half of the competition. Making them lip sync for their lives in a bare-bones sync seems fair, but otherwise, it's just the host's decision, and that could cause some issues.  -- I would be adamantly against having to memorizing and preparing performances for two songs each week. The vets know how much effort y'all put into developing a concept for one song. Even in a bare-bones sync, we all want to make sure we provide the best sync possible, especially if it decides whether we get to stay. Having to put that effort into 2 songs a week will burn out people quickly and probably cause quite a few to quit half-way through.  -- Most folks are probably in agreeance that RuPaul songs should be out.  While syncer's choice is arguably best, it would be neat to make each of the top 3 to choose a song that best defines each of them. Something along the lines of, ""Give us a song & performance that best defines who you are and how you want the voters to see you.""  Other than all the blabbering on, I'm excited to see all the stuff you'll do for us, Ms. Queen Bee."

It helps other posts be seen and enjoyed as well. :) You are super enthusiastic, and it's nice to see.  ""It Takes Two"" was great! The camera effect was used brilliantly and I really liked the energy. Nice job!  Be careful with overusing effects. It was really hard to watch ""Cold Hearted"" because of how many of you there were. It took away from the performance.  Also, keep in mind for the competition that your intro and outro can be used more effectively - They can tell part of the story of your video, rather than just be self-promotion for your Youtube channel."

LSFYL,2s2oc1,UEH,8,Sun Jan 11 17:25:43 2015 UTC,Too bad lipsyncing has very little to do with making it far in drag race.
LSFYL,2s2oc1,GeminiGaga,4,Sun Jan 11 20:52:27 2015 UTC,Oh my bad I thought this was a subreddit for lip syncing.
LSFYL,2s2oc1,GeminiGaga,3,Sun Jan 11 23:12:48 2015 UTC,"Haha no, no. Im glad you posted this because it's nice to see what the Drag Race girls do with their drag, I'm just saying- what they really do is usually poorly represented. Like, these queens are mostly all about lipsyncing and performance but you only lipsync on drag race when you're in the bottom, so, I think it's a shame she can be good at lipsyncing and it won't help her make it far because there is no lipsync challenge, per se."
LSFYL,2s2oc1,mtd1988,1 point,Mon Jan 12 22:39:46 2015 UTC,"Agreed. She really is incredibly talented, but that often doesn't amount to much outside of a LSFYL situation."
LSFYL,2s2oc1,GeminiGaga,1 point,Tue Jan 13 03:37:33 2015 UTC,"Yeahh. That is my problem with drag race. If you're talented at sewing, dancing, acting, singing, and being funny, you have a good chance of winning. If your main talent is lipsyncing and the other talents are not good enough to get you by, you won't win. Which is why I don't think i'd want to audition lol."

Create a story, a narrative through the sync itself. Feel it from the top of your head to your tippy toes. Make the words mean something."
LSFYL,2ra000,Raven_Night,4,Sun Jan 4 07:46:42 2015 UTC,I agree. That's just the way that it goes.

LSFYL,2ra000,Raven_Night,5,Sun Jan 4 09:53:10 2015 UTC,"Well, as someone who thinks they're pretty good at slow song lipsyncs, I figured i'd comment;  This song isn't as slow as the way you are performing it. Yes, the tempo is slow. But you're lipsyncing this song with a look on your face that reads like you're about to fall asleep. You need to do more than just move your lips, you need to emote with your entire face- such is true for any lipsync.  and, the singer's voice sounds like he's yelling for most of this song, or at least singing very aggressively, he lays in to a lot of the notes with a lot of emotion that doesn't come across in your lipsync. If a singer sounds like they're yelling, you should be lipsyncing as if you were yelling too. And if the singer sounds angry, you should look angry.   hope I gave ya somethings to think about. :)"

LSFYL,2pf5xi,joanwaters,5,Tue Dec 16 01:59:43 2014 UTC,hiiiiiiiiiiiiiieeeee
LSFYL,2pf5xi,Zoomyx,1 point,Tue Dec 16 03:33:26 2014 UTC,"Hey, so since you're going to be Season 3s host, what do you think of the idea?!?! Since a lot of people audition, It would give almost if not all a chance to prove that they have skills and are here to win! I can elaborate more on the idea if you want!  I was thinking that in the audition tape just like in ""Meet the Queens"" each person should say a song that they would like to lip sync to! Then from the 24 songs 12 would be randomly picked out and distributed at random as well! Then all the pairs will lip sync to the songs, for each song we vote on who won the lip syncs! Then when the top 12 are decided, they will be in the regular competition! With someone getting eliminated after each challenge! Meanwhile the losing 12 will be paired off and from the 12 remaining songs, 6 new songs will be randomly picked and assigned! Then once again we vote on who we think should win the lip sync each week! And again with the remaining 6 and 3! Until a winner is declared! And they will rejoin the competition after the 3rd person has been eliminated from the regular season as part of the top 9! And then keep going with the regular season!  It's more videos, and more voting! Voting time should NOT be extended cause of this since it really doesn't take that long to vote! And if you're lucky enough you'll get the song you picked and we'll see if how well you can turn it out! 😂  Note: This is NOT the Carrion Thread as the winner will return to the competition! The carrion Thread is a separate thing!"

LSFYL,2ofpad,thelettergii,6,Sat Dec 6 05:03:09 2014 UTC,"I am conflicted about this week. On one hand, every video was good and the theme really brought out some of the best performances we've seen.   On the other hand, Gii sucks and she doesn't deserve to have anything she's affiliated with go well.   Everyone did so great. I'll definitely say that my top five are /u/ediecentric , /u/mtd1988, /u/Babeford, /u/zoomyx, and Moose. But real critiques will come soon!  reversedcoconut: Anyone who did a Eurovision song for Gii Week deserves to win. I think you actually felt the emotions of the song really well and your movements were controlled and concise. The sync was also on point!   axelknight0717: You're getting more controlled every week! I feel like you've found a way to channel your endless energy into a tighter routine, which is always good. You seriously keep improving and I feel like by the time summer comes around you will be a contender for Season 3! Keep it up.   GeminiGaga: I found the camera a bit strange until you got up, and then I was gagged. You were feeling your oats hardcore and it's infectious. You looked like a girl at the club who's filming herself dancing and maybe you're a LITTLE drunk but you're not so drunk that you drop your phone and break it. Which is a compliment. This one was a treat to watch, seeing you get all excited and moving around was a nice touch.   swedskee22: The best videos are the ones where the performer is clearly enjoying themselves and loving the song. This was so fun to watch, especially because it's your first. I was smiling a lot because you were just so into the performance and seemed to be having a great time, which as I said with Gem, is the best way to make the viewer feel the same. An excellent first video and hopefully not the last.   Babeford: You said you wanted to give dancer and you did. You are such a fun person to watch, I feel like you can just get in front of a camera and entertain with anything. Your way of moving and the high energy you bring always cover up any flaws you may have with other areas, which admittedly aren't many. Again, just a really fun video to watch. Easily one of my favorites this week.   Zoomyx: Beat Zoomyx at Arts and Crafts week just got a lot harder. I feel like you're the one who took Basic Week and pushed it as far as you could, next to Harper you made the most interesting stuff with the limited materials allowed. That's always been one of your strengths, and you paired it up with a great song choice and a bit of spoken word. Hoemyx was one of my favorites this week.   EdieCentric: I mean, what is there to say. This was hilarious, the funniest video of the week hands down. You committed 100% to your concept, and despite all the mania and craziness involved the sync itself was very tight. Your faces were amazing, and the moment of realization made everyone gag. Needless to say this was one of my absolute favorites this week, and one of my favorites of the challenges so far.   viqule: Well I'm glad you didn't quit! Because this was fun as hell to watch. Your facial expressions and gestures are hilarious and so on point for the different parts of the song. Picking a high energy song is always helpful to keeping the viewer watching. But that's just a shortcut, and the best way to keep interest is to commit fully to the performance, which you did.   KHRoxas: The sinfulness of this sub is ungodly. Again, the idea is commitment. You didn't seem to stop and think ""this makes me look dumb"", you ran with every expression, movement, and spasm and you made it work. This is key, and despite my moral outrage at your shocking lack of shame, I give you a lot of credit for COMMITTING.   that said let me borrow your hat gurl  BitchEva: don't no one care  mtd1988: Your body language is so diva. I love that you took this song, which isn't exactly diva, and turned it up to be kind of a cunty ""I'm the bad bitch"" routine. I feel like, if I met you while you were working at your 9-5 Sephora counter job, you wouldn't really help me that much but I'd leave with some mild insecurity issues. And I like that. One of my favorites.   Moose: 10/10  druidcandy: CC took her downers and I think she might be dead, guys. I think everyone expected Eminem from the outfit, but this toned down Femm song actually worked really well, until you died at the end. I like a more subdued approach from you, and it's one of the slower songs this week, which helps make it stand out. Good job, trying new things and not failing miserably! I fear failure and ridicule above all else, myself.   alexlopez49411: NEIN  Raven_Night: Sisterhood of the Travelling Eurovisions! Your 'guysss I was coldddd' excuse may have worked with everyone else, but I'm onto you, bitch. Beyonce week was a while ago, put your action fan away. This was a really well executed look without going overboard and running against the theme, and it worked perfectly for the song and your movements. The video had a really good vibe going on, probably one of the most well executed concepts overall.   UEH: You strongly embodied the 'whiplash' title of this song. I got a seizure trying to keep up with some of these movements, it was actually pretty cool. I'd say you were second to Babeford in terms of utilizing your space and giving good movement, most of the videos this week chose to do more of a on-the-spot thing, so that helps to make you stand out.   TheHarperValleyPTA: someone get this bitch some central heating  This was a really cute video, and you went the furthest in terms of using the materials allowed to create a really nice scene for your video. Sync coulda been tighter, but I really liked the atmosphere and the overall feeling of the video. Your acting really sold the whole thing.   LSunday: Not much to say here, you made a really daring and cool choice to do a random song, first take. Obviously, it wasn't rehearsed, but you did a great job for a first take. It feels weird to critique something that you didn't get a chance to actually practice, so I'll just say you shouldn't knock your camera off the table next time, you sloppy whore.   heychrisk: Ursula definitely discovered veganism, which is no small feat underwater. Anyone who does Poor Unfortunate Souls has to know what they're doing, and you did. Your 'BODY LANGUAGE' part was especially great. It's a shame you didn't have time to construct paper tentacles and a giant bodysuit, but maybe next week. Top marks!   dorpanthera: mom there's a homeless guy in your closet  no he doesn't want money  he's just staring at me  Another slow song done well. I loved the expressions, you really mixed the classy sound with the somewhat sad tone the singer is giving. The switches between the two come exactly when the song requires it, and it's not an easy transition to make. I think you did a wonderful job.   Well, I have to rewatch a few times to decide my votes for real, so I might edit this later with more in-depth critiques."

LSFYL,2ofpad,mtd1988,6,Sat Dec 6 09:11:53 2014 UTC,"Overall: This was the strongest batch of entries outside of the competition EVER. As a viewer and a competitor, this is the challenge that I have had the most fun with. Kudos to Gii and to all of the submitters!  **  Reversed Coconut – Loved the emotion behind this. Sync was tight as hell, too. One of my favorites!  AxelKnight0717 – Bathroom realness! Liked it a lot; your growth is evident!  GeminiGaga – Loved the song choice. Good energy and movement!  Swedskee22 – The attitude! I live! Fantastic first effort. Wanna see more from you for sure!  Babeford – One of my favorites this week. Loved seeing you move around and give it to us!  Zoomyx – Super clever idea! Your video made me laugh.  EdieCentric – Pure, unadulterated genius. One of my favorites, hands-down.  Viqule – You were committed. No, wait, you should be committed. I always get those mixed up! (Srsly, you took a stance and still managed to have fun with it!)  KHRoxas – I like that you went a comedic route with it. You sold the funny!  BitchEva – I adore everything about this video, from the song choice to the decision to shade Glorious Leader. One of my favorites this week.  MTD1988 – I don’t know her.  Druidcandy – You showed range and versatility. This is my favorite video from you and one of my favorites this week.  AlexLopez49411 – Es war schön, ein Video von dir sehen. Ihr Konzept war sehr interessant, auch!  Raven_Night – Understated, yet effective. You emoted well. Fantastic video!  UEH – This might be my favorite video of yours, too. It was well thought out and the sync was very tight.  TheHarperValleyPTA – This video was adorable. I love that you did Ella Fitzgerald, which makes it easily 10x cooler than any other version you could’ve picked.  LSunday – If “Songs From A Hat” smoked a ton of crack, it would be your concept, and I love that. Super creative take on the week!  HeyChrisK – I am not worthy! Love that you competed this week, Ariel!  DorPanthera – Super tight sync. The part where you came close to the camera gave me chills. Good job!  **  TL;DR: Three of these people are getting my votes: /u/ReversedCoconut , /u/Babeford , /u/EdieCentric , /u/BitchEva , /u/Druidcandy"

LSFYL,2ofpad,greatjake122,4,Sat Dec 6 13:04:03 2014 UTC,"Okay so here's my opinions that I am sharing even though no one asked or really cares, but I wanna, and I'm gonna watch all of em all the way through for the first time ever.  My opinions are heavily swayed by song choices, and I'm sure this will end up way too long.    reversedcoconut - first of all love your look and aesthetic, and right off the bat I noticed you know how to sync like you're singing.  A lot of people will end up just looking like they are mouthing the right words, but thats it.  You however look like you are singing your heart out and you know your shit, so it was awesome!  You totally had the perfect energy and look for that song.  axelknight0717 - Okay first off I'm so sick of this song personally lol, but I overlooked it to give your vid a fair try like everyone elses all three full minutes of it!   I actually love how you danced out the instrumental intro, you have so much energy and I can tell you would be great on a stage.  You knew your words and timing, and thats good, it didn't get like ""Actually singing"" vibes from you but I feel like your strength really showed in your movements, your presence, it would be perfection in a stage environment and you have to me real queen potential written all over you!  GeminiGaga -  I loved this one! You are so amazingly gorgeous, watching you werk it out and have a blast was a nice way to spend 3 and a half minutes.  The song choice was oh so draggy and I loved it! You were feelin it,  I was gettin like POV dancing on the dance floor with you, it was awesome! If I had anything to pick apart theres a few times the sync went off a bit, but like it was a blast and did I mention how gorgeous you are, cause you are!  swedskee22 - Wow when you listen to a whole song it sure can get repetitive, but it was upbeat and catchy so I liked it!  There's nothing I love more than a gay boy feelin it an serving like girl realness though you were a tad reliant on that hand gesture, still great first time, great energy, you seem cool.  I was with you up till you went for the comedic take on the higher notes, not my choice, but hey it was fun, you seem fun, and you give good sass (lol thats one typo away from a very different compliment lol)   Babeford - I like major chords and upbeat tempos, and so far this week is great for me, I was so happy to hear you picked the original version! And the look, I was so feelin it, the shorts the shirt the hair, everything worked, I mean those legs!  Also gurl I forgot how well you perform through your body, a lot of other people might have a few drag queen-y moves, maybe move around a bit, but you're just a natural you know how to move yo body, chicken leg moves and all lol, I loved it!  You combined like goofing off dancing, actual dancing, performing, serving good face, all at the same time, you're such a strong performer!    And I'm so glad I watched the whole thing cause when the crying verse started it got even better.  I dont think I ever made it that far into this song before lol, it was super fun.   Zoomyx - OKay well, thats the best damn paper wig I've seen it yet, lol.  Also alll the points for romy and michelle intro, nothing holds my attention more than spoken word for some reason, so I found your vid easy to get through, and I loved the song, again it was like upbeat and happy-ish so of course it was great.  The other audio clips added in were kind of clunky mixed in with the song, I get the concept, it sounds like a good concept , but ehhh idk about all of em cause it messed with the beat and energy imo, but everytime the singing came back, I got the energy back and I loved it!  like seriosuly who can resist you singing with all that energy and smiling and everything.   EdieCentric - OKay I was not even prepared lmao.  If this concept was written out I would have though it was the stupidest idea ever, but this is like youtube famous quality humor, like no offense to everyone else, but this was so well executed, its like most people can't approach this level,  I was like, how does this video not have thousands of views already. Seriously lmao.  I mean you synced the song PERFECTLY, and you sold the concept so well.  I was literally laughing which doesn't happen often, and like you seriously looked like you were orgasm singing.  this was the best and most unique aproach to opera I think I've ever seen lmao. ALL THE POINTS.    viqule - omg this song brings me back!  Its weird, its been so gay and female-y up in here thus far it was quite a shock to see like a guy syncing a guy it was interesting!  At first I thought I wasnt gonna like it as much cause you're style is less ""I'm singing in a band"" like the song, and more acting out words/dancing tothe song, but once I saw you dancing to the instrumental parts in between verses I was like omg what am I saying this is way more enjoyable than if you were like singing into a mic or something.  You were really enjoyable to watch, and looked like you had fun, which made me have fun. And if you're like trying to be all cute, well its working lol.  I watched ALL OF IT, and enjoyed it! A nice almost hetero adventure for me lmao."
LSFYL,2ofpad,greatjake122,3,Sun Dec 7 10:00:35 2014 UTC,"KHRoxas -  totally random song choice, never heard it before but it was awesome, lmao, and I liked your construction paper additions, no points for shirtlessness tho thats just pandering lol (tho very song appropriate)  I felt like you did great at the sync but honestly I thought you could push the comedy even more, maybe more through you body somehow.  Your face was totally there, but your body was like ""Im digging the groove of this song"" its such a funny broad take on alanis, I wanted to see more crazy I guess. The very end second was a genius touch tho, lmao.  Good job!  BitchEva - I liked the song lol, of course this was more of a goofing off sync and it totally worked as one, lovd your wig, your syncing was mostly on point, tho at times I think you looked a tad relaxed for how high energy the song is.  Also I'm not sure what the inside joke rivalry thing is between you and Gii so thats over my head, but the rest gave me like late night goofing off in a dorm room vibe, and I like that, and omg the song choice still lol.    mtd1988 - at first I was like uh oh rapping, but you had this shit down.  It was on point! I wasn't familiar with the song, but again, catchy, funky, still continuing in the good song choices, like just a super solid sync.  I honestly don't have anything to critique on this one lol, you had good energy, good movement, good job!   druidcandy - don't hate me, but when I realised this was a serious one, I was like OF COURSE the one week its all upbeat and goofy and catchy you go slow and realistic, lol, but I mean for a slow serious sync you made really good choices.  You have good connection to the camera/audience, and you totally match the emotions and energy of the music, the sync is tight, and even tho muscially its not my style, you totally looked like you were singing your heart out so I thought it was really solid.   alexlopez49411  Oh alex, lol, your music choices, its just so you.  Honestly I liked your approach with the like blackness and the single light, it visually totally fit. Lol not really my speed music wise, but you totally gave a real performance to it, tho sometimes it just verged on that line of performing to the camera, to you just performing to yourself in a mirror and watching your own facial contortions lol.  But still A for energy and concept!  Raven_Night - Okay the addition of the fan blowing the scarf/head cover was just one of the super good decisions, its so simple but so effective!  A more serious sync, but you sold it, I got total music video vibes from your performance which totally worked.   You gave the essence of production value while still in the basic week parameters, it was really good!  And of course the actual word sync was super on point!  UEH - have you updated webcams? cause I've seen a lot of mikey syncs and I feel like lately they got more HD.  I also feel like at this point you've totally got your style of syncing honed and perfected.  the look was great, the sync was on point, no shabalabtuna-ing here lol.  And your moves feel less freeform, and more like choreographed which works well with this song.  And I mean, its been a while for me its nice to see a mikey sync every few months, good work!   TheHarperValleyPTA - Other than missing the start cue lol, it was great!  I love your versatility cause you can totally sell classy lady while just sitting in front of a cute paper fire.  someone else gave you cool points for choosing Ella Fitzgerald (ella lol, name twins!) which I agree it totally does give you cool points.  And omg the marshmallow catching on fire, adorable.  I think you win for most effective use of materials for your setting.   And yeah you could totally either be in a gap commercial or like have your own christmas special, actually yes you should, I'd watch that.   LSunday  - Insteresting concept!   Ifeel like you actually got pretty lucky with the song choice just based on how werked it, or maybe all 170 are really good and you just know thm all and have good taste!   I wasn't familiar with the song, but I liked it!   Like you seemed like you really knew it well, and just performed the hell out of it.  Nice moves, cool idea!  heychrisk  - okay, don't hate me lol.  I just can definitely tell you've been on the stage more since season one cause I totally felt like you were performing all the way to the people in the back of the audience, it was a very exageraty interpretation right off the bat which is not bad technically at all, just I hear more sultry/enticing from the start of the song, and you started with a lot of punctuating hand gestures idk, I know I'm being harsh but its only cause I know how talented you are and what you can do already, and I'm picky :p  All the points for makeup tho and of course theres still so much talent on display here, your words are the most on point.  And once the song kicks into to gear I felt like it caught up to your energy and really worked well.    dOrPanthera - I swear allll the points for this song choice, I know peggy lee, but I hadn't heard this song before, and like what a perfect end of the night/end of the list song really, its just perfect.   You had my attention the whole time, and the actual lip sync was on point.  like you need a small stage and a spotlight, and I'd probably pay money to watch it, Idk I like the vibe.  ALso nice lighting, that spot light reflecting in yours eyes is subtle but makes it all the better.  Good work!   All in all like a crazy good week. I love all the music you guys and gals introduced me too!  I enjoyed this more than many weeks of the actual real competition to be perfectly honest and I'm happy to see so many talented people having the motivation to participate! Reminds me why I started coming here in the first place.  :)"

LSFYL,2ofpad,LSunday,1 point,Mon Dec 8 01:21:45 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I did get lucky with that one.  I'd say there are probably about 30 songs in the list that would have been perfect for this concept, 90 that would've worked out fine, and the last 50 would have been very awkward to sync this way.  (overlapping vocals, long instrumental sections, or requiring more movement than my dorm would allow.)  All in all, I'm happy with this one.  Just for fun, I hit skip for the next few songs to see what would have come up if I'd waited.  The next two songs would've probably been fine, but then the third one woulda had a lot of sitting and waiting.  (Take Good Care, which is a fun song but has a 2:11  instrumental intro that I would edit out if I were to prepare a performance of it)"
LSFYL,2ofpad,Babeford,3,Mon Dec 8 19:39:39 2014 UTC,Thank you so much for your kind words! I definitely think I lost some energy in the second verse but hopefully I brought it back for the crying part haha. Glad you enjoyed it!

LSFYL,2nky62,cheerfulstate,2,Fri Nov 28 11:38:19 2014 UTC,I was so genuinely thrilled when she said Femelle. CONGRATS.
LSFYL,2nky62,MikiClash,2,Mon Dec 1 17:34:23 2014 UTC,UEH that was a good fucking number I'm so glad it got shown <3

LSFYL,2n1wiy,thelettergii,5,Sat Nov 22 03:55:26 2014 UTC,"Posting this early because I might not be around in an hour! Now I’m write a text and words.   The theme is EUROVISION. It actually isn’t, so you should watch the video to find out what the real theme is. Do it. Watch the video. All videos must be linked to me via Reddit PM by Friday, December 5, 11:59 PM EST. If I happen to be on Tinychat or wherever, feel free to send it to me there too. I thought about accommodating for Thanksgiving, but it would mess up the schedule for the next challenge so I decided to just keep it at two weeks. This is a very simple challenge, so please don’t stress too much over it! Make it short and sweet. I will post the videos as soon as I can, hopefully around midnight. You guys get three votes as usual, but votes will not be accepted until Saturday, December 6, 12:00 PM EST. I explain a little more in-depth in the video, but basically I just wanna emphasize that you should watch ALL the videos, to completion.  I didn’t really talk about this in the intro vid, so I’ll do it here: when the videos come out, please watch the entire video and not just the first 30 seconds! I’m sure everyone will be working really hard to make great videos, so please make sure you watch all of them when they come out! Voting closes on Sunday, December 7, 11:59 PM EST. You have a day and a half to vote! Don’t worry, that’s plenty of time.   For this challenge, I really encourage you to work on both expressions and enunciation, as people are gonna focus on these two given the nature of this theme! If you have any questions, please ask. Comment here, PM me, whatever.   Okay, have fun everyone! DANZEN"

I didn't want to mention it in the items because I didn't want people thinking ""HO HO I CAN USE SCISSORS AS A PROP #LOOPHOLE"".  But as long as the final product we see is made out of only those three items, you can use whatever you want while you're making them, if that makes sense!"

LSFYL,2n1wiy,GeminiGaga,2,Sun Nov 23 19:05:16 2014 UTC,2 questions-   Am I allowed to have a non lypsyncing performer in the video?  Am I allowed to edit the audio track…like cut it short if I think it's too long?  XX
LSFYL,2n1wiy,GeminiGaga,1 point,Mon Nov 24 07:04:45 2014 UTC,"Editing the audio track is definitely fine! I think with the performer it would depend, but as long as the video mainly focuses on your lipsync (i.e. the other person shouldn't steal the show) then it'll be okay. :)"
LSFYL,2n1wiy,joanwaters,2,Mon Nov 24 08:07:22 2014 UTC,Where the frack am I to find construction paper?! I've only seen poster board and in non-useful colors.. My drug store and grocery stores have failed me and I am sad.

LSFYL,2l410j,dipthonggirl,1 point,Mon Nov 3 00:27:17 2014 UTC,Sheeeeeeit I might have to join in so I'll have to perfect iPad editing real quick! Do I auto win if I film it at Hearst Castle (Lady Gaga's G.U.Y) or on Alcatraz?
LSFYL,2l410j,starlightzone,1 point,Mon Nov 3 13:32:47 2014 UTC,"No, you autowin if you get the DWUW video out before the videos air."
LSFYL,2l410j,druidcandy,1 point,Mon Nov 3 14:58:19 2014 UTC,Will they even let you film a video there?  I mean really all the power to you if you can film somewhere like the pool but
LSFYL,2l410j,dipthonggirl,1 point,Mon Nov 3 21:08:50 2014 UTC,"I feel Hearst is the least likely. I'll be staying the night in the airport, so I think they won't mind too much at 3am"
LSFYL,2l410j,KHRoxas,2,Tue Nov 4 01:18:54 2014 UTC,"So these have to be the ""least-heard"" versions of the cover then? if I am getting this theme correctly?"
LSFYL,2l410j,Raven_Night,2,Mon Nov 3 04:40:00 2014 UTC,"Not necessarily the ""least"" heard, but I don't want Whitney's ""I will always love you"" cause it's technically a cover of Dolly, for example."

LSFYL,2kmv8l,LSunday,1 point,Wed Oct 29 03:16:05 2014 UTC,"Oh, you. That dress is actually from the first drag look I ever did. I put together a sort of '50s housewife look. My act doesn't really call for the Donna Reed getup anymore, but the shirt dress has done surprisingly well as a non-traditional witch costume."
LSFYL,2kmv8l,Babeford,1 point,Wed Oct 29 03:23:02 2014 UTC,"Cool!  I still technically have the first drag look I ever made, but since it was a wrap it's actually just a few yards of bright pink fabric.  (Which doubled as my ""green"" screen for the CK videos)"

LSFYL,2k9mes,Babeford,8,Sat Oct 25 06:00:06 2014 UTC,"I spent all week watching Degrassi: The Next Generation, eating poutine and reading Alpha Flight to prepare for Canada Week! Thank you, Babeford, for delivering an inspired challenge and everyone really delivered.   Now on to the critiques, eh!   UEH - You, and mostly everyone, had excellent song choices. I don't mean ""I like this song so it's good."" I mean the songs were conducive to creating a good lip sync performance. Your energy matched the song and that's good. I saw the picture you posted of your make-up and it looked great; I like the black and white palette. My question, though, is why would you film the video in black and white? It takes away from all that make-up work you did! I think it would help you if you gave a full look in your videos, too. You put on this make up and maybe a wig, but then a hoodie, or a hat. It detracts from the overall impact. Raven_Night - Raven, your concept was so fun for me. I loved your take of being a survivor of some kind of apocalypse. Your make-up was great, too! The only suggestion I could come up with would be playing up that you were in a more dire situation. Act like some zombies were about to leap over your fence! Get a little more frantic at some parts, possibly. With that said, this was a sublime sync!  GeminiGaga - Gorgeous as ever, Gemini. This was a pretty good video! I've always been a fan and I enjoyed this sync, so I'm glad you made it. My critique is.. get your butt to a club and turn it out! Your next video better be you as a bar queen! ;) EdieCentric - Welcome, Edie! I was impressed with your sync video! I like how simple it was yet it captured the spirit of the song. You show a lot of potential, I hope to see more from you in the future! Viqule - The production value of this video was the best, the split screen was handled perfectly and I loved the concept and sync. Very impressive work. Also, Viqtoria looks like a girl I know for real; it's uncanny. My only critique is.. what's up with the RuPaul Drag Race Season 1 filter? Viqtoria is too pretty to hide her face behind all that vaseline. This is in my top 3. KHRoxas - This is such a departure from your previous videos and it served you very well. The concept was simple but strong. The lighting was better (!) and you seemed really natural for most of the sync.  My only critique would be to watch those words! There was a mumbled turn here or there, but it didn't detract from how strong your video was. Great job!  LSunday - I love your video so damn much. You faked me out, thinking it'd be Nelly Furtado and it was the most fun Canadian song I've ever heard. Your dance moves were gnarly, your energy was on point and you really committed to your performance. I think I had the most fun watching your video this week. This is in my Top 3!  dOrPanthera - You certainly know how to make a sync memorable. This was such a fun performance, Dorp, and I love how off the wall you are. (Syrup bukkake?!) Good job, man!  thelettergii - I like that you brought something new to the sync. You gave me raver hoop girl who likes things big and I was with it. My gripe here is the framing of your camera. Your performance wasn't as centered as I would have liked and some of the shapes you were giving with your hoops just were off to the side, so we didn't get that full effect. If it was centered, it would have been that much better! cheerfulstate - Cheer! Nice job with your first official sync. I love that you incorporated sign language into your video, it really made it stand out. I think you had a genuinely fun time and it showed.  MTD - You felt at ease with the song and that's important. I definitely like that. Unfortunately, this was a step down from your last performance! You were lacking the energy that you've brought to your previous videos, so definitely keep an eye on that.  druidcandy - Your look was fun and cute. Your performance was so very much unlike you, that I was really impressed. I enjoyed the little different quirky movements you did while you performed, like holding up your face during a certain line or just being flirty with the audience. You definitely entertained. Good job.  seanoc23 - Kudos to you, Sean! This is by far your best video to date. The concept was solid and it was all the details, like the scrolling text over the screen, that sold me. You should be proud of yourself because this was a stellar video. No real critiques here!"
LSFYL,2k9mes,AgentFear,2,Sat Oct 25 12:26:46 2014 UTC,"Aw, Thank you. :)  I would love to perform at a club. I just... deep breath Really don't want to do an open-to-anyone drag competition. So, I would LIKE to just show up to drag shows, in drag, and get in a good graces with hosts, so I can work my way into their shows, However, i'm at a point in life where most of my friends aren't 21 and those that are are either too busy with work and life, or have their own drag to promote. And god knows I do not have the guts to go out in drag alone and be social, nor would that be fun for me. Therefore, I'm not really sure how to make it happen. But it will. I just don't know when."
LSFYL,2k9mes,GeminiGaga,2,Sat Oct 25 12:42:47 2014 UTC,"Thank you for the critiques. If I wasn't so worried my Asian neighbors would call the cops, I would've gone more frantic xD"

LSFYL,2k9mes,Raven_Night,2,Mon Oct 27 03:19:44 2014 UTC,"Thanks agent! I wanted to have the sync as tight as possible, every little breath, and to fit the theme to the T.

LSFYL,2k9mes,viqule,2,Sun Oct 26 19:23:00 2014 UTC,"Thanks Agent! I already explained this to you but I figured I could explain it again where everyone could see - I filmed this using the back camera of my phone, so I had no idea where I was standing most of the time. I thought the back camera would be higher quality than the front camera (which I usually film with), but I guess not! I'll be switching back to the front camera after this. :3"

I wanna comment on everybody's videos again but last time I wrote longass essays so this time I'm just gonna talk in caveman language starting ugga  UEH: Face really good. Five rocks out of five. But black and white filter on top of black and white look? Color would help make look stand out. Song good. I love song.   Raven: Concept is solid like rock. Fits song good. You good lipsyncer. Consistently good videos. People bypass you for some reason. I think you must break mold to stand out. Go different. Go above and beyond. Like asteroid.  Gem: Grunt. Look good. Vest reminds me of beast I hunt yesterday. Could move camera down. To see more arms. Love how your mouth moves. Good to see you back. Grunt.  Edie: New person! Hello! Oui oui song, I see. Interesting choice. I like. Simple sync, but you did good. Great expressions. Keep at it.  Viq: Ugh. Is not bad ugh. Is good ugh. Great performance, you are convincing woman. Great work. Camera fuzzy like sabretooth cat, but is okay. Does not kill me like sabretooth cat.   Roxas: Well done! Unlike my steak. Have not invented fire yet, you see. Good to see something different from you. Two clubs up!  Sunday: Babz trolled with theme, you trolled with video. You dance like the mating rituals of my tribe. Work on expressions more, but it worked for this video. Very well played.   Dor: True spirit of Canada. Would have liked to see more Canadian gags. Mooses, anything. You made me laugh. It alerted sabretooth cat to my location. Now I must hide.  Gii: Gross  Cheer: Fun, simple sync. Nice touch with ASL at the end. Even so, would have liked to see more. Maybe puppets or something. Could move mouth more in future. Cute first video!  Mikey: Love your lesbian look. Wanted to see more of everything. More enunciation, more energy! You had it, but you could give more. Also, try to avoid upright film. Upright is overrated. grunts and slouches away  Druid: Similar to last challenge, but this one better concept. Could have used more shade and not just dance moves, so much potential there. Try to edit brightness before uploading, slightly washed out.   Sean: Cracked up. Great execution. Would love to see more funny syncs from you. cough Tina sync cough In end, you had less enunciation, so watch out!  Good job everybody! I mean, ugga ugg"

Ya probably get extra points from me if you did Shania because she is one of my favorite artists ever BUT yeah.  & for the (I believe) few of you who have never put up a lipsync before, or don't very often at least, I couldn't tell because you all did so good."

Loved the sync  Roxas: You're gay  LSunday: I hate and love you so much for this sync. Loved it.  d0rianPandaPaws: This was so cute. Hopefully none of that got on the carpet. You delightful goofball~ Also this Up to 1:20.  Gii: I don't think i'm on enough drugs to fully enjoy this. Lovely sync. Needs more hoops.  Cheer: Aww! Your first sync! Love it and the sign language was a nice touch =D  MTD: NO ONE ELSE LOOK AT THIS SYNC! Loved it MTD~ Like seeing you have fun with these.  Druid: OH GOD THE SNAPCHATS ARE MOVING.

LSFYL,2ho7gv,Babeford,2,Mon Sep 29 21:05:47 2014 UTC,"Wow, 12 entries! Giisus Jesus fuck you guys, and they're all great videos to boot! I know a lot of other people were planning on doing videos as well (stares at Alex and Starlight among others), and I really hope you pull through even though the challenge is over because I'd love to see what you had in mind.  Anyways, it's like 3 in the morning so I'm going to ramble. I'm really impressed by everyone here -- except that bitch Gii. What a trainwreck. Can't even dress herself properly.  UEH: You had the right energy and attitude for this performance and I dig that. I know people make fun of your flailing but I actually think your arm movements worked perfectly for this song. I also like how you enunciate your words, I need to take a page out of your book. The blanket backdrop was a little distracting for me because I was afraid it was going to fall at some point, and honestly I didn't think you needed it. I'm totally fine with seeing you lipsync in your room, and also the paleness of the blanket kind of made you look washed out. I think you said you used clown white but I couldn't really tell because you looked pretty pale to begin with, haha.   Speaking of which, I give you props for dragging up, but I'm not really a fan of how you painted your lips. I don't think you needed to extend your mouth because you have a pretty wide mouth shape to begin with, so maybe keep that in mind. However, I do love how you did your eyes! You look great with eyeliner.  druidcandy: LOOK WHO FINALLY DID A SYNC FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER, GOOD ON YOU! Your performance was all about movement. You move with your whole body and you should keep that in mind when you're framing -- I kind of wish you had filmed more like waist/hips up because a lot of your moves get cut off. Is it too much moving? Personally, I feel like that's your style, and I don't really have a problem with it and I actually kinda like it. The only issue I see is that people can't really see your lips move, because you're moving too fast for anyone to catch you.   Wasn't really a fan of the beginning, I didn't think it was necessary. But aside from that, I really enjoyed watching you lipsync. You're feeling the song with your body and you're absolutely adorable with your expressions. Especially with your dandruff flying everywhere. Hehe. Good job good job!  LSunday: Haha, well you did mention that including the claps was an accident. That aside (it's not even an issue for me honestly), I think you've come a long way since the Carrions and I am really amazed to see how much you've improved. Your look is great, I love your wig and I just love the colors in your video overall. Lookwise, you could draw your eyebrows further apart, but aside from that this is really great and props to you!  The look isn't the only thing I have to give props to. I got more energy from this performance than I've seen in most of your past videos, although I would have like to have seen more moves. I think in previous Carrions you tended to do long, slow songs unless the theme severely limited your choice, and for challenges I'd like to see you tackle more of these fast songs. The more you do, the more you'll be accustomed to channeling the energy that these songs call for. But here's an LSunday clap for you, because you rocked this one! (CLAP)  Babeford: Sometimes the simplest route is the one with the most impact. Fantastic job. The emotion was there, the lipsync was on point, and you blew everyone away without having to wear wigs or buy props. You're always so creative with your lighting -- actually, how do you get dim lighting without making your camera go all grainy? Because my camera gets super low quality when I turn off the lights.   Anyways, I kinda wish the frame of light was just a bit wider; I know you weren't going for lighting your whole face, but sometimes it gets distracting when your mouth is just out of that rectangle of light. But that's like a super nitpicky criticism, and even as is you did a great job!  Raven_Night: I already told you this. 1/10 because you didn't strip. Severely disappointed. <3  Kidding! I love that we got dance-y Beyonce, and emotional Beyonce, and now we have sexy Beyonce. And you do the song SO much justice, you were definitely top Carrion for good reason. You have all the confidence, all the attitude, everything the song calls for and I'm also jealous of your garter and stockings. To be honest, I'm not really a fan of the red filter even though I get it, but I do have to say that the flashes at the end were genius. The video quality also made it hard for me to see your mouth, so I would say always keep your camera horizontal instead of vertical because it might be easier to say (EDIT: see) things. But this is all technical stuff. Performance-wise you were amazing, as always. My only advice on that would be to try exaggerating your movements more, because sometimes I felt that you were a little reserved and you could have moved your body more. Especially since you were so far from the camera. Regardless, TITS -- I mean, TOOTS for you!  (to be continued)"
LSFYL,2ho7gv,thelettergii,2,Sun Sep 28 10:43:53 2014 UTC,"mtd1988: Bitchmikey, you shady bitch. You're an even bigger Carrion Surprise than you said I was! I'm just gonna go ahead and take the credit for suggesting you take the shady route with this song, BUT you were the one who delivered it and you delivered it so well! Rewriting everyone's usernames? That was the best idea ever, and of course you saved the best for last! (I mean me, not you, obviously.) Haha, but anyways you were totally able to deliver a FANTASTIC lipsync -- I love how you mouth each word, you really have a natural talent at this -- while delivering FANTASTIC shade at the same time.   Only thing was that the card where you said you were changing everyone's usernames was cut off. You probably noticed this as well, but honestly because this was such an important card, I would have preferred you did another take and made sure people could see that card. :P But that's a technical thing which could easily be fixed. You're a serious contender for my vote this week dude, and honestly you're a serious contender for Season 3 as well and I hope people are starting to realize that.   axelknight0717: Welcome! I thought it was nice of you to include an intro, but I hope you save some stuff for your Season 3 introduction! I couldn't really catch what you said about being the first ___ person to win a lipsync competition, did you say ""street"" or ""straight""? Or something else? Hahaha either way, you seem like a great guy and you should come chat with the rest of us on Tinychat when you can!   I think this is a great first lipsync, you had the attitude of the song DOWN and I lived for it. Major props for doing all the Single Ladies choreography. I'd love to see you try to take your future lipsyncs out of the box -- nothing wrong with this video, but I'd love to see what ideas you can come up with! It's like Phoenix doing that LSFYL to Bad Romance and she just did all the choreography -- she danced well, but in the end she lost that lipsync over Delta's more original performance. I also notice you used a video stabilizer, and to be honest it was a little distracting and you don't really need it. Try propping your camera up on a stand sometime? I don't have a stand but I just get a pile of boxes and books and put my camera there, so maybe you can try that. Overall, you're starting out pretty well and I'm really excited to see more from you!  viqule: Damn. You said you wanted to try something different and this is definitely nothing like your last two! The concept for your video was very strong -- I loved the idea of switching from guy to girl, and the whole temptation with drugs and darker things. To be honest, I'm not quite sure how I feel about the execution of your concept. On one hand, I think you could have found a wig that would have suited you better (maybe a flatter one?) and I wasn't really a fan of the white stuff around your lips, BUT I know exactly what you were going for and honestly, your look is just very enthralling in that weird sort of way.  You move your hands a lot, mainly to signal various words and phrases. Sometimes it comes off as unnatural, because you are signing so many different things in a short period of time. I would recommend considering your movements over lines of lyrics, rather than just words, if that makes sense. Your femself did it better than your male self. I think it would also help if you tried moving more with your body and not just your hands and arms, so that you're really feeling the lyrics. Basically, try to make your movements more natural. But anyways. That ending was fucking SOLID and I'm so glad to see this video from you! Great job!  dipthonggirl: Okay, that firework background is the cutest and most hilarious thing ever, and it's also pretty clever to boot. I get that you had the Communist hat and shirt, and it was pretty silly, but due to the framing of your video I didn't realize you had a Communist Party shirt until the end of the video, and due to my lack of ignorance I didn't know that was a Communist hat. If there was some sort of insignia on the side, I would have liked to see you maybe start out the video in side view or something like that.  I saw that you were trying a little vibrato, which is good. I would have liked to see you waggle your lips a little more. I know it's hard, I can't even do it myself, but maybe try practicing in your free time? Haha. I think you can try exaggerating your lip movements in general, actually! You did it a little, I want to see you do it MORE. This was a simpler, slower song than some of the others, so you want to display strong lipsyncing technique. Critique aside, this was fun to watch and you are also super adorable! Can't wait to see you do more videos! :D  KHRoxas: Roxas, I can't believe you went through the trouble of putting together a mix. After you said you wouldn't want a Mix Week too! The mix is fucking rad, especially the little Bayonse and Family Guy gags. This is really a solid video even without the ending you wanted. It's clear from your adventures on Tinychat you put a ton of effort and thought into this video; however, it's not the kind of effort that people not on TC may realize. So I just want to give you a shout out for doing the mix, sewing the tearaways, everything. Kudos.  That said, your performance here is very similar to your first video. Similar attitude, similar movements. It might be because you did Beyonce songs both times. It's not bad -- in fact, I love it, but I am looking forward to seeing you try a different style of performing in future challenges. I also wish you'd done a different colored tank top from your shirt just to make it clear that you had done a tearaway, and at the part where it says ""Stop"" I would have loved to see you just freeze in place instead of putting your hands down. Besides that? Solid lipsync, and it's always fun to watch you dance! Hehe.  seanoc23: I've said this like 5 billion times in Tinychat, but I'm going to say it again. You really should do more videos in boy drag. I think it's great that you're working on your makeup skills, but to be honest I'd rather see the character of Sean than the character of Ophelia Tina Waters. You're just a fascinating person with a fascinating story to tell, and the emotion from you in this video was amazing. You don't need drag to shine.   I think your video and audio were slightly off, which did throw me off for a while, so pay attention to that in the future! I would also have liked to see some vibrato from you on those long notes. But your performance was there, and I love how you enunciate the words. You have kind of a small mouth, so it was good to see you exaggerate your lip movements to compensate. Keep at it. This was a great way to end an amazing challenge, and I am so glad you finally turned in another video. Looking forward to seeing more of Tinuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...

Druid, lol I'm sure I would love this if it was synced up, I love tho you gurl lol.  Lsunday, love your drag and the energy tho the syncing was a little shabalabatuna at times. I loved the part when you were like gettin into it near the end and audibly clapped  nd then you did that pointing pose on the beat omg I live lmao.  mtd1988 good for a first time ( at least I think it is) got your words down but watch those cards goin out of the frame, otherwise liked it! axelknight0717 so young and such good moves werk! viqule I'm not sure what to say lol unique memorable look for sure, good sync! KHRoxas  I dont really remember seeing you either, loved the energy the mix, the dancin, you gots a performer in you for sure. seanoc23 you totally were giving me all nighter realness which brought back some memories, loved the sync too, I see how you used that ""hot mess"" vibe as you described it to your advantage lol.   all in all great job everyone it was fun!"

LSFYL,2fvgwd,heychrisk,9,Tue Sep 9 03:21:18 2014 UTC,"I like it, and I hope it's something that will be incorporated into the competition next year. I've also been toying with the idea of breaking the monthly challenges mold. If I wanted to host a challenge (you have two weeks to do your favorite britney song), put up a prize, and count votes/announce a winner, would that be allowed? I know it's not what has been traditionally done, but I think it would be fun to let people who haven't won monthly challenges do stuff, too. Or people who just like watching and have a fun idea!"
LSFYL,2fvgwd,TheHarperValleyPTA,7,Tue Sep 9 03:55:42 2014 UTC,I'm personally all about that. Anything that builds participation is a positive development as far as I'm concerned.
LSFYL,2fvgwd,theGstandsforGabriel,2,Tue Sep 9 04:00:57 2014 UTC,I agree. I was talking with /u/UEH about doing that but didn't want to step on the community's collective toes.
LSFYL,2fvgwd,starlightzone,1 point,Tue Sep 9 15:39:30 2014 UTC,"I had just been thinking about this, but I definitely want to see this! Please do it!"
LSFYL,2fvgwd,TheHarperValleyPTA,1 point,Thu Sep 11 01:13:30 2014 UTC,I will have to see if I can get a cool prize and theme together!
LSFYL,2fvgwd,ThePrincessEva,6,Thu Sep 11 01:18:54 2014 UTC,Honestly that sounds extremely fun just from the perspective of a viewer.
LSFYL,2fvgwd,joanwaters,5,Tue Sep 9 08:25:20 2014 UTC,I have always been into the idea of having folks actually lipsync for their lives against one another. Whether people select the song by a vote or if we just rotate and have different hosts select a song for a week...either could work and be a total blast.  I totally dig it.
LSFYL,2fvgwd,theGstandsforGabriel,2,Tue Sep 9 16:24:32 2014 UTC,That sounds like it could make for a fun winter mini-season or as a concurrent add-on to the monthly challenges.
LSFYL,2fvgwd,thelettergii,5,Tue Sep 9 19:57:52 2014 UTC,"Actual LSFYLs would be great, but I think a big factor would be how often they would be. For me, too many of those in a row might get tiring, but in the end it should be up to whoever's running the challenge. I like Gabe's idea of suggesting songs within a given theme, but I'd be okay if the person in charge chooses the song on their own as well.  I think we might as well talk about how we want challenges to work this year? I heard that Garbanian (who won the last challenge) is planning to start his challenge at the end of this month, but I'm also all for giving everyone a chance to host. My suggestion would be to have a main challenge, probably stickied, which would follow last year's pattern (aka the winner gets to decide the next challenge), and then offer the option for anyone to post their own challenges on the side PROVIDED they offer some sort of prize. Maybe the minimum prize could be a month of Reddit gold or something. Idk."
LSFYL,2fvgwd,Garbanian,4,Tue Sep 9 22:22:46 2014 UTC,I've always wanted to video collab a song with someone or a few others. Everyone does a section of the same song and we connect them together and all <3
LSFYL,2fvgwd,theGstandsforGabriel,1 point,Wed Sep 10 01:00:50 2014 UTC,I'd totally be down to sync a verse of something in a group number. That'd be a blast!
LSFYL,2fvgwd,KHRoxas,3,Sat Sep 13 14:08:11 2014 UTC,"That definitely seems like it could make a good off-season challenge and/or be incorporated into next season's later stages (or would it be less cruel in an earlier week?). Obviously for the next season that's up to the reigning queen, but I wouldn't mind giving that a shot!"
LSFYL,2fvgwd,thelettergii,3,Tue Sep 9 15:41:38 2014 UTC,"I would love this. I wish it happened more too. As it comes down more to syncing ability than anything else.  Long as we bar Gii from making suggestions then I am all for this [;D]  I would say a vote would likely be the best option as the shenanigans that happened with ""Songs from a hat"" week caused some sour reactions. The issue would be how the songs that we vote for are picked.  Anything that gets this and by extension the tinychat active [more so than it's been] is wonderful. I can't wait for the challenges!"
LSFYL,2fvgwd,theGstandsforGabriel,7,Tue Sep 9 19:07:16 2014 UTC,"I am okay with making no suggestions for everyone else as long as I get to make all the suggestions for Roxas.  ""For this challenge you will all be lip syncing for your lives to 'Anaconda'...except KHRoxas, who will be lip syncing to 'Ovo je Balkan'. Again."""
LSFYL,2fvgwd,pawnstache,3,Tue Sep 9 19:45:48 2014 UTC,"There are just too many songs to make a realistic vote with. But if we had specific themes (Female country singers, for instance) you might be able to have everybody submit one or two options and then vote from there.  Otherwise, we could do it where we have rotating hosts who make a list of  songs which are then voted on. Either way would help with consensus, and I agree that we want to do something different than the songs from a hat model."
LSFYL,2fvgwd,starlightzone,3,Tue Sep 9 20:00:28 2014 UTC,"What about a competition that has the tekken tournament type style. People get paired up and given the same song, the pairs compete against eachother and the members vote who did better, the winner advances to next level, and then they verse the other winner etc and this continues on to the final two?"
LSFYL,2fvgwd,axelknight0717,2,Sat Sep 13 04:35:17 2014 UTC,"I like this idea a lot actually! It would be something fun for an off few months and if I had a prize to give, I would definitely throw this up myself."
LSFYL,2fvgwd,axelknight0717,1 point,Sat Sep 13 06:38:18 2014 UTC,"Yea that's actually a very good idea! And if that were to happen there would have to be 16 contestants unless you want a top 3, then 12! But either way it will be like 3 or 4 weeks long at most so I think it should be like an ""All-Stars"" concept in a few years!"

LSFYL,2f22oc,joanwaters,3,Sun Aug 31 19:00:52 2014 UTC,"Is it shady to thank somebody for being shady?  I kid. Honestly (and I've said this before), I was always worried how I'd fit in as the straight guy in the competition and it almost kept me from auditioning. In fact, the only reason I ended up giving this a shot was because you made it a point when announcing the season that this was a place for everybody. Which might sound a little silly in retrospect, but it can be really scary to jump into something like this when you have zero experience and feel like an outsider. Any fears I had, though, were completely obliterated from the very first moment of the season, and its that support that helped me grow as a performer and find a home among you all.  This is such a special community, and I'm just proud to be part of it."
LSFYL,2f22oc,theGstandsforGabriel,3,Sun Aug 31 06:37:18 2014 UTC,"Chris before I even opened the video I knew exactly what you were talking about for Zoomy's ""Clown"". I totally agree! Such a powerful, subtle expression.    Thank you for your kind words, Chris! I know you're proud of each one of your children in this competition but it's nice to hear specifically why you love each of us (: I'm so glad I was in this competition and I'm glad we all became best friends and that we entertained each other and all the quiet and not-so-quiet spectators. <3"
LSFYL,2f22oc,Babeford,3,Sun Aug 31 21:04:44 2014 UTC,"Queen Appreciation Thread: Ariel Italic  This queen of queens is the only reason any of us had the experience we did. She gave us a spectacular season full of twists, drama, and incredible entertainment, and her star power is only matched by her ability to tolerate/obliterate internet shenanigans when needed. You deserve all our thanks and then some.   Congrats to everyone else. Y'all are wonderful, talented, vicious, lovely, exuberant, and delightful. You're a load of classy broads and brassy clods. And I love you all. Thank you."
LSFYL,2f22oc,Noahk519,3,Mon Sep 1 02:41:07 2014 UTC,"This is probably the best compliment you could have said to me: Fashion Week was the first time (and arguably the only one) where I had a more serious approach, and it's the week where I felt the most ""naked"", probably because I was not hiding behind funny or crazy (tho the fact that I had no clothes probably helped me feel naked I guess...). So, hearing you saying that you got goosebumps really touch me :)   Thank you for being the host you've been during this entire competition, Chris. You did more than chose a theme and make a few intro videos: you've hosted one of the best experience I've had in my life, and you were always there to answer me when I had questions / interrogations.   Now, get on drag race with Joan so I can say ""OMG I KNOW THOSE BITCHES""!!!"
LSFYL,2f22oc,Zoomyx,5,Tue Sep 2 15:12:53 2014 UTC,"Such kind words! Thank you. :) Growing & learning is exactly what I wanted to do with this competition, and with that I think I succeeded, and I still want to continue to do that even now that the competitions over, which is good! This has brought me closer to feeling like an actual queen instead of just an observer. I used to go to drag shows and think ""I want to do that"", now I go to drag shows and think ""& I could do that too"". And will, soon, I hope :)"
LSFYL,2f22oc,GeminiGaga,2,Sun Aug 31 08:19:12 2014 UTC,"I am the youngest! I'm only 8!  But in all honesty, thank you Chris. I came here to have fun and that's what I accomplished. Seventh place was just an added bonus."

LSFYL,2f22oc,theGstandsforGabriel,2,Sun Aug 31 21:22:21 2014 UTC,"Chris, it has been an absolute privilege to have had the opportunity to compete under your season. I am unbelievably grateful for that and do not take it for granted. Thank you for making this ride thrilling and fantastic! You were my very first exposure to this sub so receiving such a kind message from you is one of the best things EVER.  I learned so much from my fellow contestants, experimenting (with drugs and alcohol jk), and lastly, having someone who I admire and look up to guiding the season the entire way."
LSFYL,2f22oc,dOrPanthera,2,Mon Sep 1 00:05:08 2014 UTC,"Ariel, your work this summer has not gone unnoticed. You are so amazing and such a doll for hosting our tomfoolery this summer. You and I WILL see each other at Star Search this week, trust!"

LSFYL,2f22oc,MikiClash,2,Tue Sep 2 18:48:50 2014 UTC,"Oh girl, you sure you want to turn away the D for Star Search? It's there every week.  JK, work bitch.  Doing my signature number this week I think! #PrincessPeach"
LSFYL,2f22oc,MikiClash,2,Tue Sep 2 03:54:00 2014 UTC,"Yaaasss! I think I'm gonna drag out ""I Wanna Dance With Somebody"" since I already did my ""Total Eclipse.""  And sure, Star Search is there every week. But so is the D."
LSFYL,2f22oc,TheHarperValleyPTA,2,Tue Sep 2 04:09:04 2014 UTC,So many selfies to be taken.
LSFYL,2f22oc,Garbanian,2,Tue Sep 2 04:53:20 2014 UTC,"ahh I'm just now seeing this! thank you for kind words. I surprised myself a lot this competition, and I'm glad i was around long enough to surprise other people, too. I hope I conveyed how much I enjoyed having you as our host in my final video, because I can't imagine how anyone can outdo you. I found this community when you were crowned last year, and at the time I really didn't get why you were so emotional. Needless to say, now I do. I hope I can continue to grow and evolve as well as you have, because I know there are amazing things in store for you.   On an unrelated note, I cannot wait until we get to experience Ariel Italic as a viewer rather than a participant. I'm praying for shade!"

I love the colors you chose and the details of the guillotine earrings and chandelier hair really add even more character to it. Great job!"
LSFYL,2etvj2,simdude,4,Thu Aug 28 16:30:07 2014 UTC,Don't worry too much about downvotes (most of the time). Reddit fuzzes the voting so that people can't figure out its exact algorithm and exploit it. This was made even more dramatic as of a few months(?) ago when they hid the information deeper so now you can only see the net votes even with RES.  And yes I have to agree the colors make this print GORGEOUS.
LSFYL,2etvj2,thelettergii,3,Fri Aug 29 20:23:38 2014 UTC,"See, I thought the whole point of hiding the upvotes/downvotes was to stop the vote fuzzing, but I don't know."
LSFYL,2etvj2,Garbanian,6,Fri Aug 29 20:46:31 2014 UTC,I need this on a shirt in my closet about a week ago. I expect to see it there then as well. Your continued diligence on this matter is greatly appreciated.

LSFYL,2etvj2,GretaGarbology,3,Fri Aug 29 14:54:35 2014 UTC,"You're right. It is completely different stylistically. Personally, I like your work better! Chad is talented, no doubt about it, but your attention to detail is wonderful. Keep on plugging away!  I hope you are better at setting your screens than I am... It takes me about 30 practice prints before I get the registration right. My colors are always overlapping!"

LSFYL,2en3sg,TheHarperValleyPTA,10,Tue Aug 26 17:02:56 2014 UTC,"I am so so glad that you did a portrait of the winner. Seriously, a Chad Sell portrait is a fucking milestone in the life of a drag queen, and receiving mine last year was a definite breathe-slow-and-blink-back-the-tears moment. You're wonderful for contributing. It means a lot. MWAH."

Thank you to everyone who has followed this competition. Thank you to Ariel Italic for running it so well. Thanks to all of my competitors and new friends in the tinychat. You guys have all been so wonderful.  Harper, I feel like I'm better because of you and your undying fire (Girl on Fire reference). You are a fiercesome (not misspelled) competitor and I am better for having seen what you put out into the world. You're an artist. You're beautiful. You work so hard and it all looks effortless which is the mark of a skilled entertainer. You're an inspiration to everyone and I'm happy to call you a friend and peer.  Zoomyx, I've been a big fan of you since the beginning. I admire your creative spirit, your amazing energy and your imposing screen presence. You've made some wonderful things this summer that have made me laugh and creeped me out and just generally entertained me til I was peeing. Great work!!!  I love you all. I'm beyond excited about this and I can't wait to host this competition next year! Thank you all for everything!!!"

I'm so glad that I met you and I really can't wait to see where you take the competition next year! /u/Zoomyx : my shady, beautiful canadian friend! You have such a vibrancy in your videos, and it was immediately clear that you were one to watch! I can't wait to see what you make when you have more time and more freedom to do what you want, because I know it will be fabulous! And to everyone else in the competition/subreddit/tiny chat.

Thank you so much to every competitor who put the in the time and effort to make their performances amazing, and especially to our Top Three who simply could not be any better.   And our winner. You, my dear, are going to be a big deal some day. But first, you have to host next season and do as good of a job as Ariel, so the next crop can show their skills too. Your technical skill, charisma, and immense presence were clear in your very first video, and you only improved from there. Congratulations, dear."

You were so good at organizing and arranging everything, this really felt like a legit reality competition at times. I really appreciated how well you put everything together, I could tell you put a ton of thought into everything and it really did pay off. Hopefully we can see you more in the chatroom now that you're a plebian like us, heheh. And the winner has some huge shoes to fill for next year!"

Joan - Ms Joan Waters. Can't say I was surprised! From week 1 I knew you were a top contender and look where we're at. I think you've come a long way, your drag has improved tenfold and you are one helluva queen! Congratulations mama, excited for you to host next year!    Harper - All the way through this I was on your team and still am. Every week your videos were an experience and I look forward to more! Top 3 is an amazing achievement and you've done us girls proud, baby. <3    Zoomyx - Bien fait! Every week I was wondering what sort of entertainment you would come up with and you never disappointed. Every week you connected with your audience and that is exactly why you are in the top 3 with these fierce bitches. Your charm and ingenuity really added to this competition and I am so proud of you for making it to the top! Canada represent!"

Harper, you've raised the bar every week with both your dedication and the importance you give to small details. You have been a fierce competitor and have a great personalty. I hope we keep in touch :)  Joan, oooooh Joan. I knew you'd win the second I saw your summer week video. Your mouth is amazing, your sync is amazing, your face is amazing. Your are my definition of a winner: you've been a front runner this entire competition and I am honored to have met you. I couldn't have dreamt of a better host for next year, I have total fate in you. The drag world is thirsty, Joan, and your Waters is the only thing that can quench it's thirst.  To the competitor who were already eliminated, thank you so much for all the efforts you put into this. You were all amazing. I wanted to say this in my last video, but I was scared it would look like I was begging for votes and I didn't want that because all I am saying comes from the bottom of my heart.   Garbanian, you are the fiercest bearded lady I have ever seen and your talent shine right throught the screen. Seamus, you kept your head high no matter what other said about you, and your strenght should be admired by all. Druid...  Noah, the first victim of the death bed curse. You left too soon, circus friend, I hope we keep in touch on facebook <3 Miki, you are the definition of perceverance. You never gave up and week after week, you kept improving. I swear to god one day I'll come to one of your show, my favorite video game queen :)   Babeford, my canadian sister! Your elimination was a shock to all of us. You are one of the nicest person I have ever met in my life, and I don't think we could have dreamt of a better Miss Congeniality. Shutt, you were clearly the black horse of the competition. Week after week, you gave amazing concept: you are the definition of originality and versatility. Gabriel, I STILL WANNA DO THAT DUET!!! You've been consistent this entire competition and pushed your limits many times (oh, and I loved those little ""cooking with gabriel"" moments in the tinychat!)  Dor, thank you. For always being there when I needed you and for listening to me murder english without ever saying anything in skype. You are more than a simple internet friend to me and I am soo happy I got to meet you. And finally Gemini, my top 4 sister. No matter what the comments said and no matter the difficulties you had, you always gave your 100% week after week. Your mouth is one of the best this competition ever had, and you should feel very proud of everything you achieved in here.  I'd like to thank everyone who ever voted for me throughout all of this. I may not have won, but I can keep my head high (after all, I won both the first challenge - if you don't count audition week - and the last challenge - if you don't count the final haha!). I improved so much during the few weeks I passed with all of you, not only lip sync wise but also as a person, and that is much more importatn than any other prize.  Aight I'm done haha :) Sorry for the wall of text guys! I'll try to still come in tinychat during the rest of the year and participate to the other challenges as well (and you better do the same, or else meowmyx will come and get you....

Thank you all so much not only for raising the bar each and every week but for making this a competition that was worth being a part of. This summer found a lot of us at some difficult or even downright depressing places in our lives, but every week the three of you and the rest of the competitors and the Carrioners took what little you had and you made something new and exciting and funny and, really, I think that's what this competition is all about, what LSFYL is all about: Entertainment.  All things else aside, you brought us joy, and for that you all deserve crowns."

You are all beautiful and amazing people and you have made my summer so filled with laughter and love.   Congrats to our lovely Miss C, who was a fighter through and through.   As a Carrion, you all have made me feel so accepted and welcome in the community and I can never thank you enough for all the love you've given all of us that were lost in the bloodbath. I was in a very dark place before I came here and now I know I am surrounded by people in all places who can help me.

LSFYL,2ei22o,KHRoxas,5,Mon Aug 25 17:29:22 2014 UTC,"So here we are. We've made it to the end of Ms. Ariel Italic's wild ride.  Zoomyx:   You were a delight to have in the competition. You had creativity and you never let a song or week get the best of you. Delivering all that while keeping an upbeat attitude and always smiling, no matter how crazy it looked. You're a wonderful person and you best stick around for the challenges.  TheHarperValleyPTA:   From the intro video I can't remember to your final vid. You have grown so much. Not just in look but in ability as well. You pushed the envelope each week with your syncs. Adding a new filter, using green screens, HAND ANIMATING BIRDS. It has been a pleasure getting to know you and all your wacky antics. Like Zoomy, I hope you stick around for the challenges.  ManOWaters:   You rubber mouthed bastard. You were a wonderful talent this season. From your intro video, I knew we would have a bit of crazy on our hands. You gave fresh looks and mouth for days. You have succeeded Rainbow Dust and are now our reigning old maid.. I mean Queen. I look forward to the shenanigans you will have in store for Season 3 and I wish you the best of luck. I hope you stick around the Tiny Chat. You already have the damn crown, let the rest of us win something goddammit. To our Queen. oof    The Tiny Chat:  It has been great getting to place faces to all those voices in my head.  Seriously though, it has been a wonderful experience. I hope to keep in touch with a good deal of you now that we're in the post season and I don't know how many of you will be sticking around. You've become a great group of friends and a support system as well, even though I never talk much about my personal life. I loved how close knit we all became and I can only hope that Season 3 gets to experience the same feeling of community and friendship that this season has solidified  so perfectly.  To my Season 3isters:  Get ready bitches~"

LSFYL,2ei22o,TellTheOwlsImHome,6,Tue Aug 26 02:02:45 2014 UTC,"What a ride. This season proved to be competitive yet supportive for growth. All three finalists showed dominance yet growth throughout the entire competition. Kudos to you all.  The tough aspect of this week and this whole competition is that the voting is, in fact, a small representation of your talent. It's your appeal to the voters. What landed you three here was not just your strength in lip-synching but your ability to make the viewers like you. To garner your friends to vote for you. To push other RPDR fans to go the extra mile. As Ariel said in the beginning, he didn't want to make this a popularity contest...but, innately, it is. It's the internet, for God's sake.  I know this is of little comfort, but I want to say it, my darlings. All three of you are SO deserved of the win. You each have greatnesses that the others lack--Joan, campn and vulnerability; Harper, versatility and resourcefulness; Zoom, charm and poise. Though the prizes aren't equal, that seems to not be the main goal, but rather to be the best. And, sadly, that determination cannot be fulfilled. The winner was decided by the voters, not an esteemed panel of judges.  So know this: our victor is our top queen, but all three of you are finalists. The best of the best. The three who never landed in the bottom even once. The kids who brought it every muthafugging time. And no one will take that away from you. And we will never forget in this subreddit that the top three was tighter than a twink. (LSunday, IDC what your chart says. They were never in the bottom.)  I will be sending all three of you prize baskets. I know this is late announced, but I am assembling them as the fervor dies down. I love you all for giving me joy this summer. I'm excited for the future of this subreddit. We are not many, but we are one solid wolf pack.    I was present for most of the journey, and though I showed face only for the last few weeks, I felt I made a little scratch in the Tinychat. Thanks for making me feel welcome, everybody."
LSFYL,2ei22o,joansbitch,3,Mon Aug 25 05:04:53 2014 UTC,"ETA- Joan just told me that everyone is like WHO DA FUQ, hahahahah. I swear I'm not a random creeper... I go way back with Ms. Waters and made her a Facebook fanpage that way I could be smug and say I was the first person to like her. I followed the entire competition and LOVED everyone's work.

LSFYL,2duufl,GeminiGaga,3,Mon Aug 18 04:00:17 2014 UTC,I love the comparison of your 3 year old video and your current one! It shows a lot. Your performance here was fantastic and your mirror message was just perfect!  How has no one else done that yet?! Smart choice! :)
LSFYL,2duufl,AgentFear,2,Wed Aug 20 13:09:43 2014 UTC,Thank you! :) And i'm surprised no one's done it yet either. I thought it'd be a good send off from the competition. :)
LSFYL,2duufl,GeminiGaga,2,Wed Aug 20 16:14:36 2014 UTC,As stated before it has been a pleasure watching you grow through out the competition. This was a nice sync and the mirror message at the end was cute. Great Job.

LSFYL,2duufl,AgentFear,12,Wed Aug 20 13:05:55 2014 UTC,"So I had no time to do anything out of the ordinary but I did this sync a little earlier this week, but the Arctic Monkeys have their shit on lockdown so here's my sync for the week on Google Drive."
LSFYL,2duufl,Babeford,3,Mon Aug 18 04:02:14 2014 UTC,"Videos like this are exactly why it was such a tragedy that you were eliminated as early as you were.   I love the aesthetic of this and I am also loving that you're just becoming more femme fatale as the summer progresses! Fantastic video, truly.   Babz4AllStars"
LSFYL,2duufl,AgentFear,1 point,Wed Aug 20 13:11:34 2014 UTC,"Thank you! As heartbroken as I still am about being eliminated, it was kind of fun to be able to stretch and experiment without any repercussions of being in the competition.     I'm glad you've enjoyed my transformation (: <3"
LSFYL,2duufl,Babeford,2,Thu Aug 21 06:28:12 2014 UTC,This is intoxicating from start to finish.   How did you do that.

LSFYL,2duufl,Babeford,11,Mon Aug 18 20:07:26 2014 UTC,"Alright kids. I know some of you have been waiting for this, solely to read me to filth because of my critiques this season. So here ya go.   I am going to be trying out for Season 3 and  constructive and helpful feedback would be wonderful as I know I will be in desperate need of it. You can of course shade me the house down.  Baby's First Sync"
LSFYL,2duufl,KHRoxas,6,Mon Aug 18 04:23:08 2014 UTC,"Let's do this  Obviously I'm just kidding! I'm really happy to see some skills in your initial sync. The energy at the top and in the Nicki verse are flawless. Even though the rest of the song is a bit more subdued lyrically, I'd like to see that same conviction extended into those section and you'd be golden.  The eyes thing ain't a big deal. Especially in rap performance, there's so much going on that it feels like you've got a bigger audience than a camera, so I get that. Experiment a little with depth. Coming closer, going further. Other than that, I really enjoyed it!"
LSFYL,2duufl,joanwaters,1 point,Mon Aug 18 19:54:21 2014 UTC,"I KNEW you would get what I was going for. Totally convincing suicide. Even though I missed the one crucial detail, but then how would I get it on the intarwebs?  That aside, thank you. I can see the sort of lack of energy in the middle. I'll work on that. I think I did come closer in this take, I could be wrong hahah. I did mess with it a little, granted they weren't huge steps.  I shall play around with various frames."
LSFYL,2duufl,KHRoxas,2,Mon Aug 18 20:24:01 2014 UTC,"It's not that the energy is bad in the middle. It's not. When songs slow down, it's just always a good rule of thumb to bring an extra oomph to small movements or eyes or hit that mouth just a little harder to sell it.  But I have faith that you're gonna figure all this and more out with practice."
LSFYL,2duufl,joanwaters,4,Mon Aug 18 21:33:38 2014 UTC,"I clicked on here with full intentions to read ya to filth, but it honestly was actually pretty great.  The only helpful critique I have it try to play to the camera more. That's where your audience is.  But other than that, good energy & good sync."
LSFYL,2duufl,Letsshootthequeen,2,Mon Aug 18 08:48:30 2014 UTC,"It was the weirdest thing, I was looking at the camera when I was filming but it looks like I'm just staring off to the left. haha. I'll make sure to work on that.  Thank you for the crit shushu."
LSFYL,2duufl,KHRoxas,5,Mon Aug 18 13:04:05 2014 UTC,SEE? NOW YOU KNOW HOW IT IS!
LSFYL,2duufl,theGstandsforGabriel,2,Mon Aug 18 14:21:02 2014 UTC,AT LEAST I'M NOT GIVING DEAD EYES TO THE CAMERA GABE! [<3]
LSFYL,2duufl,KHRoxas,3,Mon Aug 18 14:43:12 2014 UTC,coughs
LSFYL,2duufl,theGstandsforGabriel,4,Mon Aug 18 15:51:39 2014 UTC,"good first sync! I was expecting (and hoping) a shitty and horible video but you surprised me (haha, I'm kidding I knew you could bring it :P)  Little tips for your next video:  Try not to film in front of a window, it can make it harder to focus on you when there's a light facing us :)  In my experience, it's much better to have no source of light behind you. Instead, try to have that light behind the camera. Speaking of camera, I'm also using a logitec webcam that goes up to 1080i so I don't think thats the biggest problem regarding the quality of the video, it's probably more a lighting question :P  Try to look a little bit more to the camera. It can seem weird to look at a small webcam for minutes but it gives a much more ""personal"" feel to the vid, as if you were talking directly to the person watching. Also, I personally prefer when the camera is on the same level as the face instead of a little lower like in your vide, but that's only preference :)  I loved the way you move (the japanese part especially, but all your arm movements were excellent). Sometime you moved your head really fast while syncing so we missed some of the words you were saying. It didnt bother me at all tho, cause i knew you knew the words (gj on the sync itself, its very tight).  So yeah, I really liked your vid and I'm excited for what's gonna happen next!! Season 3? YES PLEASE!!!"
LSFYL,2duufl,Zoomyx,2,Mon Aug 18 16:39:55 2014 UTC,"I'll be sure to close the curtain for future syncs, kind of forgot hahaha.  Funny thing was I was looking at the camera, but I'll put a marker or something on it next time. Or i'll just move the camera slightly to the left.  The lighting behind the camera might be an issue as I had to place the cam on my bookshelf to get any good framing.  I'll give that top shelf a try for the next sync."
LSFYL,2duufl,KHRoxas,2,Mon Aug 18 16:50:03 2014 UTC,"for the lighting it doesn't have to be right behind the camera, it can be a little bit to the side (i never put it directly behind the camera). I don't know if others see a difference between having lighting or not, but personally i can tell by watching all of my videos which had a light and which didn't, so I think it help the video being more clear / less blurry :)"
LSFYL,2duufl,Zoomyx,2,Mon Aug 18 17:06:18 2014 UTC,"Gotcha. the light is on the computer tower to the right of the bookcase. with the light facing the wall so it bounces off. if it is directly on me, I get washed out. I'll toy with the lighting a little more to see if I can get a better set up."
LSFYL,2duufl,KHRoxas,2,Mon Aug 18 19:38:55 2014 UTC,I think you need a better camera because when you were moving a lot it was not keeping up speed wise. Otherwise we won't be able to see how on time you are ;)
LSFYL,2duufl,turnmetoashes,1 point,Mon Aug 18 11:43:10 2014 UTC,"Aww. The ""better camera"" crit. hahha. I'll see what I can do. Lacking in the funds dept atm [ha]. Do you have any cam recommendations? I'm using a logitech and it's capable of HD and 1080i. I may just have to mess with the settings."
LSFYL,2duufl,KHRoxas,2,Mon Aug 18 13:06:37 2014 UTC,"This was an awesome first sync and the fact that you chose to a faster song that's more technical is also very well done. Overall you had amazing energy, but it did get a little frantic, but that's something that you can work on! I can't wait to see what else you do and I hope to see you compete in Season 3!"
LSFYL,2duufl,alexlopez49411,2,Mon Aug 18 16:18:57 2014 UTC,"Roxxxy!   This is bringing a lot of personality! I have to say, I'm a bit impressed with this being your first lipsync. The song is all over the place, flow-wise, and you handled it pretty well. Really, this is a good job!  I do have to echo the idea of your curtain being open (choose a blank wall next time, if you can!) and the camera not being able to capture your full movements. It gives the impression like you're The Flash, moving too fast for the eye.   You've also received feedback about not looking into the camera, even tho you thought you were. Try placing a sticker by the camera, and adjust it accordingly, until you've got a direct eye-line with the camera. That way you can focus on that sticker during the sync and know you'll be getting that eye contact."
LSFYL,2duufl,AgentFear,4,Wed Aug 20 13:17:32 2014 UTC,"GENTE DO CÉU! I CANT BELIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEVEEEEEE! Roxas, I LOVE IT!"

LSFYL,2duufl,AgentFear,6,Wed Aug 20 13:21:32 2014 UTC,Singing for Fun Week!
LSFYL,2duufl,Raven_Night,3,Mon Aug 18 04:06:15 2014 UTC,What a delightful surprise! You were fantastic!
LSFYL,2duufl,mtd1988,2,Mon Aug 18 04:30:20 2014 UTC,Aw thanks. I'm always self-conscious of my singing so this was a nice way to reach outside my comfort zone.
LSFYL,2duufl,Raven_Night,3,Mon Aug 18 05:07:14 2014 UTC,YOUR SINGING IS BAD AND YOU SHOULD FEEL BAD

LSFYL,2duufl,Raven_Night,2,Mon Aug 18 05:57:28 2014 UTC,INSERT SEXY FLUTE SOLO HERE  ALSO YOU'RE WELCOME FOR THE HELP THAT NEVER MADE THE CUT
LSFYL,2duufl,thelettergii,2,Mon Aug 18 06:43:39 2014 UTC,"It's a travesty that my songs weren't chosen.. buuut, you have a beautiful voice and I'm glad that I heard you sing at all! :)"
LSFYL,2duufl,AgentFear,2,Wed Aug 20 13:18:11 2014 UTC,"Two of your songs were actually chosen the first time around (when I was helping her pick), but the recording stopped so Raven had to redo :(  ALSO YOU HAD THREE SONGS PICKED IN CARRION ANYWAYS"
LSFYL,2duufl,thelettergii,3,Wed Aug 20 16:19:48 2014 UTC,I will never ever forgive myself for not sending my suggestion (That's So Raven).
LSFYL,2duufl,pierrecruz,2,Mon Aug 18 06:02:28 2014 UTC,Omg Pierre. OMG PIERRE  HOW COULD YOU NOT SEND IT??!

LSFYL,2dp0to,TellTheOwlsImHome,4,Sat Aug 16 03:29:38 2014 UTC,"The intro video for the week is already recorded, and I'm not going to redo it. I'm not saying anything definitively, but it's entirely possible that you and I think alike."
LSFYL,2dp0to,heychrisk,1 point,Sat Aug 16 16:00:05 2014 UTC,"There was no doubt that you had thought this through, Ariel! I want to make sure that we can promote this last week as much as possible. Are you in contact with /u/feastoffun?"
LSFYL,2dp0to,swedskee22,6,Sat Aug 16 16:15:18 2014 UTC,I think it would be cool at this point to see what each person will do with 2 weeks of time to make a video. Its something thats never been done and it would be great with such talented people left!
LSFYL,2dp0to,TheHarperValleyPTA,2,Sat Aug 16 06:00:03 2014 UTC,"I agree with this. Thursday is fine, but sunday would be better IMO."
LSFYL,2dp0to,thelettergii,2,Sat Aug 16 06:00:16 2014 UTC,"I'd prefer an extension for the videos as opposed to voting, just so we can see how much the Top 3 can offer us without as big of a time crunch as they had before. I don't know if it's too late for that though!"
LSFYL,2dn48o,MikiClash,6,Fri Aug 15 15:43:10 2014 UTC,You're a superstar :)
LSFYL,2dn48o,Noahk519,3,Fri Aug 15 16:22:51 2014 UTC,PS when are we hanginggg out?? This goes for /u/heychrisk too!
LSFYL,2dn48o,heychrisk,5,Fri Aug 15 17:23:45 2014 UTC,Ugh I should have dressed up and gone to this. Maybe this coming Thursday?
LSFYL,2dn48o,heychrisk,5,Fri Aug 15 23:48:43 2014 UTC,Yes I'm going this Thursday. We take selfies and post so the sr can gag!
LSFYL,2dn48o,ThePrincessEva,2,Sat Aug 16 00:44:07 2014 UTC,"OK, so here's the story: I have a performance on Friday and I work all day beforehand, so I have to drop my suitcase full of stuff off at the venue on Thursday. Thus, I won't be able to show up as Ariel and should probably get some sleep that night anyway. However, I'm free the FOLLOWING Thursday (the 28th)."
LSFYL,2dn48o,Babeford,2,Sat Aug 16 15:28:09 2014 UTC,No problem! See you soon !

LSFYL,2djlav,heychrisk,11,Thu Aug 14 15:03:54 2014 UTC,"I literally don't have words... Which is a funny way to start off typing what is probably going to be a huge block of text, because i'm a gemini and I ramble.  This competition to me has never been about some sort of end game. I never expected to get as far as I did, and every week I would remain in the competition, I felt so grateful that I had people to vote for me, or even just people to watch my videos. This competition was a way for me to show others that drag and lipsyncing is something I want to do, because gaining and sharing a connection through music makes me happy. Never did I realize that I wouldn't just be connecting with music, i'd be connecting with so many people who would watch my videos, get exposed to new songs or just have a few moments where they could celebrate life with me through a song.   Chris, your words to me mean so much. I joined this competition more or less because of you. I listened to your feast of fun interview and then I saw that season 2 was starting and I was inspired to give it a shot. I am so thankful that you would take time this summer to host this competition. You are an inspiration to me, truly.   There isn't dark clouds in my future, there is only the stars! I don't have sadness, Only happiness that I made it to this point... silencing the voice inside me once told me I wasn't going to be able to do this. I look forward to make more lipsync videos & hopefully perform as soon as I can in Chicago. I am not defeated, I am inspired and joyous and proud of myself.   Also, I look forward to getting to know all of you more. One of my regrets this competition has been that I hadn't had the time or really felt welcomed to come into the tinychat. I will amend this and make it a goal to be more social. :) With that said, I did head to Chicago a couple weekends ago to see Joan perform and she is a lively one, let me tell you! Between me and her, I feel like some Chicago-based domination is in order!   I thank you all so much for watching my videos, even to those of you who were hard on me, my drag, my videos and my lipsyncing. I hope I proved some of you wrong in making it this far, and we can move to a place of love.  I'll end my rambling with a short poem;  Look for me in the future, I promise I won't be far, Meet me up in darkened skies, Together onward to the stars."
LSFYL,2djlav,GeminiGaga,6,Thu Aug 14 15:50:29 2014 UTC,GEMINI! You are one hot ass drag queen and I look forward to seeing more of you in Chicago and performing alongside you. People should see how fabulous you are and you should feel confident that you're sharing something very special when you perform. You're a brave person and I'm so glad to know you and have your support!
LSFYL,2djlav,joanwaters,4,Thu Aug 14 18:14:10 2014 UTC,"You are a sweetheart! I'm glad this competition has brought me aware of your existence because you are fabulous and for real, we need to tear up Chicago together as the 2 bitches from reddit. Werk! Can't wait to see your Ru video and much more from you in the future."
LSFYL,2djlav,GeminiGaga,5,Thu Aug 14 18:22:28 2014 UTC,"I can talk to my drag stepmom about you performing at the next Fabitat (or if you're not ready...a couple Fabitats from now). She's always welcoming of new queens and it's a fun venue in da city where I perform a lot. Just let me know, ok?!"
LSFYL,2djlav,joanwaters,2,Thu Aug 14 18:36:46 2014 UTC,"Sounds awesome! We will have to talk about it on facebook. I'm the type of person who likes to be 100% prepared for everything I do, so I will need to be sure that I am really ready as oppose to jumping right in & since i've never performed before, i'm not sure I know everything I should know or have everything I need. >_< lol"
LSFYL,2djlav,GeminiGaga,4,Thu Aug 14 20:38:03 2014 UTC,Aw. <3 Thanks for the love. I really hope I can perform soon! I have no idea how to go about doing such a thing but I am ready and hopeful it can happen soon.
LSFYL,2djlav,GeminiGaga,3,Thu Aug 14 16:10:07 2014 UTC,I hope to figure out a way in and start performing. Would be lots of fun and this competition has taught me a lot that I hope I can adapt into live performing. :)
LSFYL,2djlav,GeminiGaga,7,Thu Aug 14 16:16:59 2014 UTC,"Gem, I agree with everything Chris has said here. Especially this week, you have handled everything maturely and I really admire you for doing so. I really hope you stop by the tinychat more often because playing CAH with you was really really fun, and I hope to see you continue your drag career! Please stay around after the competition, you've come a long way and I can't wait to see you go even further!"
LSFYL,2djlav,thelettergii,4,Thu Aug 14 17:28:48 2014 UTC,"I definitely want to stay apart of the community, as well as do more drag. I have a lot of ideas for things I want to do and the competition itself was just the start. I'm actually feeling really awakened to a widening destiny. :)"
LSFYL,2djlav,GeminiGaga,7,Thu Aug 14 18:23:48 2014 UTC,"Gem: While you have not been as present in the tinychat as I and the rest of us would like. You have been a wonderful contestant. You had some shaky weeks but you didn't let that shake you personally. You faced criticisms and eventually let down a wall that allowed you to accept the critiques and take them in. You improved a great deal throughout the competition and it was nice to see that growth.  I only hope you stick around, let us get to know you more as you're one of the few we don't know all too well. Keep slaying Gem.    To the troublesome three. There is a long road ahead of you, even though it's like 3 days. You got here through blood, sweat, pig noses, yarn wigs, burnt clothing, terrible make up, over the top editing and effects and lip syncing. Pull out all the stops and go at this full force. Make the children eat it and leave them wanting to more. You will have some big shoes to fill, or small.. I don't know Chris's shoe size. Find that song that resonates in you and deliver the best motherfucking lip sync you have ever delivered in this competition.  The time has come, for the last Lipsync for you life. This your final chance to impress us and save yourself from elimination. Good Luck and DON'T fuck it up."
LSFYL,2djlav,KHRoxas,4,Thu Aug 14 16:25:59 2014 UTC,"Thank you! I am not planning on disappearing. I really want to get to know everyone a lot more, & of course, keep on lipsyncing. :)"
LSFYL,2djlav,GeminiGaga,6,Thu Aug 14 16:33:50 2014 UTC,"Welp! This is a surprise win to me, I thought Joan had it in the bag :P Thanks to everyone who voted for me, I appreciate all of your votes. I am honored and beyond happy to be part of the top 3 :)  Gemini, I realized this week more than ever how hard this competition might have been for you. Your are the contestant who improved the most and  I personally feel like your mouth was the tightest in the last few weeks. Keep on doing drag and lip syncing, i really believe you can go places"
LSFYL,2djlav,Zoomyx,2,Thu Aug 14 15:23:12 2014 UTC,Thank you darling. <3 Congratulations on making it
LSFYL,2djlav,GeminiGaga,3,Thu Aug 14 16:22:16 2014 UTC,"This week the G stands for Gemini GaGa Gotham  Gemini, you've had a rough road this summer between yours highs, your lows, and your struggle to find your way in this competition. You were competition to every single one of us, and the fact that you grew every week made it that much harder to pin you down. A lot of us came here to show off our talents or to have fun, but you more than anybody took this competition as a way of looking inwards and discovering yourself. It's one of the biggest challenges an artist has to face, and you met it head-on. Your unwavering dedication to your art and to your self-improvement has helped you to rise above the negativity and to bring us all up with you.  In the words of RuPaul: You have made this competition so much better by being a part of it."
LSFYL,2djlav,theGstandsforGabriel,2,Thu Aug 14 23:44:24 2014 UTC,"That was a very thoughtful comment Gabe, I appreciate it. Thank you. :)"
LSFYL,2djlav,GeminiGaga,3,Fri Aug 15 00:23:02 2014 UTC,I'm actually really quite nice once you're out of the competition
LSFYL,2djlav,theGstandsforGabriel,3,Thu Aug 14 19:20:57 2014 UTC,"well, the competition has been intense. I mean, just look at how many meltdowns there were on monday. After next week, we can all hopefully go back to being kind and friendly to each other lol"
LSFYL,2djlav,GeminiGaga,1 point,Thu Aug 14 20:40:07 2014 UTC,"I haven't been around as much to see much of the meltdowns, but I can't say I miss the drama aspect of still being in the competition. Now I get to make lipsyncs for fun and there's no comparing them to others all the time. It's cool.  gives cocktail  Welcome"
LSFYL,2djlav,theGstandsforGabriel,5,Thu Aug 14 22:12:39 2014 UTC,And our penultimate charts...  Chart 1  Chart 2
LSFYL,2djlav,LSunday,1 point,Fri Aug 15 00:22:16 2014 UTC,"Love the charts, I always cmnd+F straight to them in these threads.  But gotta ask, why do you make two different versions?"
LSFYL,2djlav,RhondaOdyssey,1 point,Fri Aug 15 00:49:39 2014 UTC,"when i posted the first ones, i had people ask me why I didn't use the same colors as the Drag Race Wiki, so now I just do both even though I prefer mine."
LSFYL,2djlav,LSunday,3,Thu Aug 14 15:10:28 2014 UTC,i can finally go to sleep knowing this information
LSFYL,2djlav,RhondaOdyssey,3,Fri Aug 15 03:07:28 2014 UTC,"Gem! You know how I feel about you already, girl. The thing is I'm still rooting for you, I think you really have what it takes to do some amazing, fierce things as a drag queen! And I love Chris' message to you in this video, it's accurate and fantastic. I'm glad you've made it this far and that we were all witness to how you've just grown as a performer. And you better be playing more Cards Against Humanity with us!   Zoomy, Joan and Harper: Congratulations!! This is it. You better werk!"
LSFYL,2djlav,AgentFear,3,Fri Aug 15 03:14:31 2014 UTC,"oh, I'm gonna werk and twerk all up in this video. Thank you!!!"
LSFYL,2djlav,TheHarperValleyPTA,2,Fri Aug 15 03:27:09 2014 UTC,"Thank you darling! I appreciate your support and love for what I'm doing, truthfully means a lot :)"
LSFYL,2djlav,GeminiGaga,3,Thu Aug 14 17:07:39 2014 UTC,"No shade to anyone else, but I'm so thrilled my two favorites from day one are in the finale, and with Zoomyx no less, who has proven to be one of the most creative LSFYLer this year.    Gem, you may be going home, but you're now among the ranks of Darienne, Latrice, Yara, Detox, Shannel, and my personal favorite- Tatianna.    So excited for the finals!  Sucks that we'll have to wait another year for The Season of Rhonda 3, but at least we'll have RPDR Season 7 in the off-season... I guess."
LSFYL,2djlav,RhondaOdyssey,5,Thu Aug 14 20:31:19 2014 UTC,I don't feel this way since the season finale of Dawson's Creek.
LSFYL,2djlav,pierrecruz,2,Thu Aug 14 18:18:56 2014 UTC,"Chris, I enjoy the fact that you used the same song you lip-synced during your round in top 4 to announce the top 3. If this was merely a coincidence, I got a kick out of it regardless =).  As one of those adamant fan folks, I must say that this has been a very interesting twist in results, but overall, we have an especially solid top 4 where each of y'all have endured a hell of a lot to make it to this point, and the endurance all of you have sported is beyond awe. The top 3 is getting exciting, especially when it comes to deciding the overall winner, and I hope this final showdown represents each of you in most amazing light possible. There's no doubt that it will.  I've definitely dug your stamina, Gemini, as well as your increasing growth throughout the competition. I can only hope that you find a group of dear friends who will push you to continue your elevation into radness. I mean, you're gonna be an All Stars candidate, so it'll be exciting to see what Gemini 2.0 brings to the table in the future.  Back to disgusting exam studying. You folks get back to being epic."
LSFYL,2djlav,viqule,1 point,Fri Aug 15 03:04:59 2014 UTC,Thank you! I don't think I will ever stop evolving. Who knows what my drag and my performing skill is like 6 months or a year from now! But I can't wait for the future.
LSFYL,2djlav,GeminiGaga,3,Thu Aug 14 15:25:22 2014 UTC,"I mean this with the UTMOST respect but this Zoomyx win feels very much like Adore Delano winning the sewing challenge over Bianca Del Rio. DON'T GET MAD AT ME. Zoomyx is an amazing competitor and I'm a huge fan... I just think Joan killed this week and I'm SHOCKED she didn't pull off another victory here.  Also, I love you Chris. That video was so heartfelt."
LSFYL,2djlav,deliciouslytacky,3,Thu Aug 14 21:52:55 2014 UTC,Votes this week count enough to keep three in. Next week is when they really count.
LSFYL,2djlav,ForestfortheDraois,6,Fri Aug 15 00:24:53 2014 UTC,"I find this comment pretty disrespectful. You're of course entitled to your opinion, but coming here only to say, in front of the winner and the people who voted for him, that you disagree with the choice is kind of low, and I wish you hadn't done it. It accomplishes nothing. With one week left, it'd be great if we could all spend more time thinking about the impacts of our words on others instead of focusing on how nice it is to type out every thought that jumps into our heads."
LSFYL,2djlav,deliciouslytacky,4,Thu Aug 14 19:47:16 2014 UTC,"I apologize for not making a more constructive comment. I was very surprised by the results and I definitely could have added more to my post. I love Zoomyx and have voted for him several times which is why I made the Adore/Bianca comparison. I wasn't comparing this competition to Drag Race whatsoever. I just love both of those queens and I love both Joan and Zoomyx. That's all that meant. I was just, especially given a lot of the feedback I saw, very surprised. If I offended anyone, that wasn't my intention."
LSFYL,2djlav,joanwaters,8,Thu Aug 14 22:19:11 2014 UTC,"People are allowed to vote however they please and while I'm flattered hear my video called ""the runaway favorite,"" that title is completely subjective. We all take this competition very seriously but I take the friendships I've made with these crazy kids seriously too. I don't suspect that you're trying to be insulting to Zoomyx, but he earned his win fair and square and absolutely deserves it regardless of what people posted in the comments earlier in the week. I'm very happy to have placed second to him this week and I'll defend his win til I'm red white and blue in the face (no disrespect to Canada, zoom)."
LSFYL,2djlav,Zoomyx,3,Fri Aug 15 00:10:51 2014 UTC,"Don't worry Joan, Canada will always love you :)"
LSFYL,2djlav,theGstandsforGabriel,3,Fri Aug 15 01:40:07 2014 UTC,"I don't get what you're trying to say here. You're comparing an instance where a winner was chosen out of five to an instance where we all got two votes to keep people in the competition. Nobody made a command decision here. We all collectively gave our support to these competitors, and by this point in the game there's nobody who we don't support.  So if your plan was to come on here and try to say that we should have supported anybody less, then it's possible you don't fully understand the type of community we've built here.  This ain't Drag Race and your internet jabber isn't anonymous. We've all put in an enormous amount of effort to give of ourselves for this competition and that demands respect. Consider that before you post things that might upset people.  (Hint: if you ever find yourself saying ""DON'T GET MAD AT ME"" in a comment, don't post that comment.)"
LSFYL,2djlav,deliciouslytacky,0,Fri Aug 15 21:58:52 2014 UTC,.... Okay then.
LSFYL,2djlav,starlightzone,2,Fri Aug 15 22:51:51 2014 UTC,"To Gem; Dear, you know I've had mad love for you. I voted for you every week and I knew you would get so far here. I'm so proud of you and what you've accomplished and I knew that you did great. You made it to the top four and so few queens can say they've done that. You always made me smile and laugh with every step you took and you killed it for me. I love you so much, my dear. It's only a short goodbye, I'm sure.  To the top 3. Well, you're here. We made it. The last lipsync. I hope you all prepared because this is gonna be tight. You've all got the charisma, uniqueness, nerve and talent to snatch the crown. So bring it hard. You better sissy that sync.  Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go buy more tissues. Saying goodbye to my starsign has got me all emotional and shit."

LSFYL,2djlav,TheOneDoc,2,Fri Aug 15 01:03:14 2014 UTC,"Looks like a lot of people have been afraid that zoomyx wouldn't make it. Enjoy your unexpected win zoom. That struggle was real. What you'll do for Ru song I have no idea but I'm dieing in Antici.........pation   I'm sure Joan is not too upset (*puts an other valium in Joans drink*) about the second place considering the circumstances.   Anyways Joan, I expect slaying out of an other dimension for Ru Song.  I don't know what you'll do or how but I trust it will be great.  Harper top 3, you deserve it!  Looking forward to your Ru Song as I have no clue what to expect.  Oh your ""You're makeup is terrible"" sync was my favorite in the competition, so far. Just sayin'.  Gem I've seen you as top 4 material from day one and I'm happy you didn't disappoint.  Keep pushing your boundaries. You got the guts and the tallent to go far."
LSFYL,2djlav,GeminiGaga,3,Fri Aug 15 01:33:15 2014 UTC,Werk! Thank you <3
LSFYL,2djlav,TheHarperValleyPTA,2,Thu Aug 14 15:54:22 2014 UTC,thank you! I can't wait to surprise everyone for the last time. hopefully it would be a good one :D
LSFYL,2djlav,ForestfortheDraois,2,Thu Aug 14 16:14:19 2014 UTC,"Well I think it's just cruel that you played ""Stay"" during Gemini's goodbye, Chris. ;)   Thank you, GG, you were always a delight to watch.  Gratz Zooomy! And to Miss Joan and Miss Harper!"

It started like almost too nice, BUT NOW omg I thought I used to write slightly bitchy demanding critiques, but there's like 4-5 people all writing lengthy negative posts.  IDK it takes the fun out of it if you are being overly critical on these people.    Last year everyone seemed to understand that by this week everyone has been doing this a LONG time, and its HARD.  I get the vibe that there seems to be more of a separation from audience to performers idk.  Cut them some slack!  Be friendly maybe even.  At this point in the competition, unless you are being really helpful to them for their next sync, lets try and not point out all the negatives because I'm sure with these four anything you are pointing out, they totally know already, and don't need reminding.  They are all hyper critical of their own work too.   If you honestly don't like the direction they are going, suggest constructive things and maybe end on a positive.  Now is the time to start saying who we love most and cheer them on!  Boost the confidence of these people, they're troopers!"
LSFYL,2d7d4b,dOrPanthera,10,Tue Aug 12 01:13:40 2014 UTC,"Thank you. I love being shady as much as anyone, but some of the comments lately have really troubling. I know it's been really affecting some of us. All of us put a lot of work into these every week so that we can entertain people, so when we are faced with constant hypercritical comments it sometimes makes me wonder what the point in making them is. You all know we are just weirdos lip syncing in our bedrooms, right???"
LSFYL,2d7d4b,deliciouslytacky,9,Tue Aug 12 01:51:45 2014 UTC,"Thank you so much. People take this competition way to seriously. I am talking for myself right now, (but I think the contestants can agree with me): the main reason I am competing is not to get a prize at the end, it's to have fun, meet new people, enjoy the ride and learn new stuff / improve myself.  At this point I'm tired of reading people saying how they were expecting more from me and how disappointed they were, when I am doing video for fun so they can enjoy them. Don't get me wrong, the prizes are GREAT and I'd love to win, but this is not 100,000$ and to me, the overly critical comments are uncalled for. Reading over and over again how disappointing you are with no nice words is very unpleasant. Can we have fun and get critiqued while still being nice?"

All of the contestants had/have done such an amazing job. Congratulations to the top 4 this week and as sad as I am that this is coming to an end, I know the contestants must be even more so and I am so excited to see how this all ends!"
LSFYL,2d7d4b,TheHarperValleyPTA,9,Mon Aug 11 04:38:47 2014 UTC,"The Fantastic 4. You had to deal with random song choices and you all delivered! Glad to see the videos this week.   Now on to the observations:   GeminiGaga: Gemini, I was rooting for you this competition. I thought you brought something different from your other competitors and I loved your look since day one. You've definitely evolved during this summer and I hope these skills you learned will cause you continue and grow into being an even fiercer drag queen, because you have it in you. Now, with that said, I did not think your video was up to snuff. I believe people gave you a Broadway song (I gave you one too - So Much Better from Legally Blonde) so you could go over the top and ham it up, so you could burst with your personality. You could have pretended the camera was Elpha. Give us those little moments that make a video go from good to GREAT. You started to do that by the end of the video, which was great to see it in you, but I wish it was there the whole video long!  TheHarperValleyPTA: I'm impressed with your ability to bring two distinct characters into your video, while tying it into the lyrics of your song. This was a solid entry into this week's competition and I really enjoyed it. I don't think I would have been as creative with the song.  JoanWaters: You won this week. 'Nuff said! Zoomyx: I know you really didn't like your song choice but you delivered on it. The props really fit you well this week and it was a very fun video. I don't think you have much to be worried about!   Best of luck, contestants. Can you believe the finals are just a week away?! This summer has been a blast and I'm glad you all kept us all entertained, week after week."

LSFYL,2d7d4b,ThePrincessEva,6,Mon Aug 11 17:44:05 2014 UTC,"I dunno how to reply to this without sounding like i'm telling some pity story to garner votes. That's not what this is. But I feel like I owe you & anyone else an explanation: I broke my laptop a few days ago and I was going to rage quit the competition... then I saw all the songs that were suggested for me and I just realized that so many people want me to succeed- and I want me to succeed- so I decided i'd make a video even if it was unedited and recorded on my phone. I ended up blowing way too much money on a laptop saturday night and I got home and filmed the video at like 1 AM and did the best I could regardless of the situation and time I had left.  I just hate to feel like I let people who enjoy my videos down because of my unfortunate happenings this week. I may not have been able to do any marvels of the video editing or prop variety, but, it is a lipsync competition foremost, and if anyone does like my video despite my lack of those things then I hope to become a Top 3'er. And all that aside, I can't believe we started with 36 or so and we are down to 4 and I am one of those. I am the only one left who has ever been in the bottom, but there have been weeks where I have been above the other 3, so i'm going to keep fighting, and this is still just a lot of fun for me and Ru is one of my biggest inspirations so I hope I get to pay tribute to her. Okay, i'm done rambling now. xo Thank you for the love, regardless."

LSFYL,2d7d4b,Noahk519,4,Tue Aug 12 01:29:15 2014 UTC,"My Final 4. It's been a crazy Summer and it was nice that I got to experience it with all of you, even if I did nothing but spout nonsense during that time.  You all brought something different to this competition and it was nice to see the change and growth in you all.  This week, I will only be giving my overviews of the sync. I will not be going on about where you can improve as I find it a bit unnecessary at this point.    GeminiGaga  Overall: I was hoping that with a broadway song that you would deliver a part of you we haven't yet seen. That you'd be able to put forth new energy and sell a song like Popular. Unfortunately, we got more same low energy that has become a standard with your syncs. You were smiling and looked like you were enjoying it, which is always good. However, more could have been done. In a week as tight as this, you cannot afford any sort of risks.   I have been a fan of you since Audition Week and it has been nice to see you grow as the competition progressed. It is my hope that you continue to grow and better yourself as a performer.    TheHarperValleyPTA  Overall: I didn't quite understand the concept you were going for. I saw it as a Mother and Daughter sort of Argusinging at each other. I also saw it as two sides of the same woman trying to battle it out but then finally accepting that they're the same person. The younger rebel and the slightly less young wife. Either way it was lost to me. I don't feel that the split screen was needed as each sync on it's own was solid. You could have just used one of them I think you'd be fine. The energy was good and your sync was pretty on point.  I have enjoyed all that you have given us. You are a strong performer and it'll be a close race to see who can take the crown. After this competition is over, I hope you keep continuing to perform and improve.    JoanWaters  Overall: Get out. You know you killed this song and you very very likely snatched this week too. Great energy as always. I liked the use of green screen and the timing on the backing slides was tight. Just crown it.  You have been a fierce, wonderful body of water and I have enjoyed drinking from you ever week. Wait. You were able to bring versatility to tough competition and no five performances were a like minishade. You gave us camp, serious, horror and pig. You have grown throughout the competition and taken some of the material to the live shows. I know you'll go far as a queen and I hope to see you on Drag Race in a few years, maybe even sooner.    Zoomyx  Overall: My french-canadian... You look like Rick Moranis in this. Your colors go weird once or twice, you get really red. You had nice energy but the sync suffered a bit from various actions and just late entrances. I liked the prop work even if it got a little racists =P. Careful, must like the bed being the death of lipsyncing queens. The robot has an a similar death rate.  I have enjoyed your time on the competition, you brought a fun energy, a psychotic smile and a nice voice~. You would have one or two weeks were the vid wasn't quite there but you could see the effort put in. I hope you continue to grow and I hope that we are around to see it.    My Fantastic 4. This is it. Next week the top 3 are to give us your best Ru number. It will be your last time to impress us and save yourself from elimination. Don't fuck it up.  As a closing note [My god is he still talking?!] I hope you all stick around after the competition and do the challenges and talk in the tinychat and all of that. This has been a great community to be apart of, save for a few undesirables... Noah ;D. I don't want to see this place become a wasteland while we wait for Season 7 of Drag Race and Season 3 of this."

Not an excuse, it is what it is, just trying to shed some light on why it might not stand up to my other stuff.

On a normal week you get to surprise your audience with your song and performance but with song's from a hat people have time to think about what they're expecting from you and how they would approach it. What I'm saying is you've got challenges like speed rap which are technically challenging but this week is all about figuring out how to deliver what the audience is expecting while still being surprising. Not to mention I'm sure everyone is exhausted at this point. So kudos for even having the energy to still stand in front of a camera and give it your all.   I'm gonna dig deep and try to channel some of the comments I used to write out.   GeminiGaga - Damn this seemed like a real challenge for you but you still brought the spirit of the song. Smiles, flirty and flakiness for everyone.   HVPTA - Looove your ""dark"" half here. I think you did well bringing two subtly different personalities. I think its really subtle but I can see how you were really going for two different personalities. Most importantly I think it was kinda clever to wait until a point to acknowledge your other half and the moment where you snap to look at each other is gold.   Joanwaters - WHERE THE HELL DID YOU EVEN GET THAT TOP? Your lipstick is the cutest touch. Love it from head to toe.   Zoomyx  - I think for someone who really wouldn't choose this sort of song on your own  you brought a lot of your own style to it. The signs and stuff in the background and such have really become a bit of a signature for you so I really appreciate them here."

I love that you made it a tribute to the original video and you still added your classic shade. Props to you, pun intended! You have made me the happiest Gii right now."

LSFYL,2d7d4b,Zoomyx,4,Mon Aug 11 16:39:07 2014 UTC,"OK Go is not an acceptable song choice   I accept it. Gii accepts it. Zoomyx accepted it. Voters will likely accept it as well. I think you're confusing the terms ""unnacceptable"" with ""Stuff you don't like.""  For example:  It's unacceptable to bring a negative attitude to this community. And I don't like you because you seem to think it is."
LSFYL,2d7d4b,ThePrincessEva,1 point,Mon Aug 11 16:43:00 2014 UTC,"Thanks Gii I am glad you liked it :) (also i'd like to say that, even if I hate the song, I still love you very much and I am 0 mad at you <3)"
LSFYL,2d7d4b,Rainbow_Saurus,5,Tue Aug 12 04:32:45 2014 UTC,"Goddammit zoomy, you cursed yourself. Anytime a girl does the robot during a lipsync on drag race she goes home. I don't want you to leave!"
LSFYL,2d7d4b,alexlopez49411,6,Tue Aug 12 04:42:19 2014 UTC,"Alright, let me rent a little.  I see a lot of people telling me that this was a week video, and I totally understand what you guys mean. However what I would love you to understand is that this week is not necessarily the most balanced. Let me explain.  I hate Ok Go. I never heard of them before and if I am lucky I'll never hear of them again. But I have to do a sync to their song. Motivation = 0. i even thought about ignoring this week theme and doing another song because I literally had no idea. Usually, you pick a song that fits the theme because you have an idea for it, but not this time. I listened to the song a lot of times but never really understood what it was about, even after asking a lot of people (one told me it was about people fighting, another about stress, etc). So   1: I hate the song. 2: I don't really understand it and can't find a story for it. 3: It's a boy singing so costume is kinda meh 4: Since I never heard it it takes forever to learn  So I decided to make a ""tribute"" to the videoclip (which is why I said that you could miss some stuff if you haven't seen the original video clip at the start of my video) and throw in some shade / try to be fun. I just feel that some people can be a bit harsh for no good reason, especially considering this week theme. ""Biggest, clunk, You phoned it"" - ""this week was kinda disappointing"" - ""Your sync is bad and you relied on props"". I work 75 hours a week. I have 3 jobs since the start of the competition. I especially pick song that I know usually because it takes me forever to learn English lyrics. Reading stuff like: you totally missed the mark and you had the worst video is, to me, not helpful and does not take in consideration the effort i put in this. I am EXTREMELY happy to read  critiques, even one saying i missed the mark, if they are helpful. I think anyone in the competition can say how hard it is to make a video, so when you have critiques that only say bad stuff, it can get you down very quickly.  Maybe I'm not reacting well (probably taking this to much at heart because I just had a shitty day at work), but this is how I feel. Anyway, I still love you all and I hope I stick around next week."
LSFYL,2d7d4b,pawnstache,8,Mon Aug 11 15:38:51 2014 UTC,"<3 Well said Zoo. I think people really need to look at the sheer amount of work that goes into these before they just spout the first thing they think of. You're great, and we all know it.   EDIT: I'd also like to say that I intentionally did not watch the original when Zoomyx said to just to see how weird his video would be on its own, and I still liked it."
LSFYL,2d7d4b,GeminiGaga,5,Mon Aug 11 15:46:42 2014 UTC,"I agree, this was very well said. I think you did a wonderful job given that the song is really weird. I googled the lyrics and honestly, they DON'T make any sense. Don't let all those Negative Neds get you down. You have been absolutely amazing this entire competition and it's been great to see how well you improve each and every week. I have loved every. single. one. of your videos and I thought you were VERY on point with your song this week. A tribute video to it was an awesome idea."
LSFYL,2d7d4b,deliciouslytacky,5,Tue Aug 12 21:35:23 2014 UTC,"I think you did so well this week given what you had told me about the song and the amount of stress you were in. You gave great energy, you had a concept that worked with the song, and you weren't afraid to let your hair down and be dorky and have fun with it. In addition, I was scared that your eyes would show how much you weren't feeling the song and I was so happy to see you not show that anger in your eyes, but instead you were engaging with the camera the whole time. Overall, I'm proud of what you accomplished this week and to see how far you've come, and it really shows. Good job this week Zoom!"
LSFYL,2d7d4b,Zoomyx,3,Mon Aug 11 06:02:41 2014 UTC,"Joan Waters.. Ive had enough. Bitch how dare you come along and single-handidly snatch that crown within a 2 minute video?? You have alot of nerve slaying me like that especially after I JUST recovered from itty-bitty-piggy. Don't you understand a bitch gotta work? A bitch gotta eat, and here you are just dropping these videos like theyre nothing. Seriously, just take all my votes bitch you deserve it. Just take that crown too, my god."
LSFYL,2d7d4b,pawnstache,3,Mon Aug 11 21:27:40 2014 UTC,"Thanks for critiquing the actual lipsyncs, I appreciate that. I wish this weeks theme had been ""No editing, no props, just your mouths"" week because i'd just love to see how everyone would do when all that stuff is out the window. But, it is what it is."
LSFYL,2d7d4b,TheHarperValleyPTA,2,Mon Aug 11 21:35:37 2014 UTC,"I've been trying to reply to you all day but Reddit keeps eating my posts?  I do agree that it's been frustrating seeing the 'fancier' performances get praised when the sync is lacking. I myself never have (and never will) vote for something because of special effects or anything like that. That being said, it's the top 4 and it's the mofucking Olympics, gurl."
LSFYL,2d7d4b,pawnstache,2,Mon Aug 11 22:03:50 2014 UTC,"Thank you for taking the time to critique.  I hope you participate next year and hopefully realize how hard it is to learn a completely new song you dislike in a language that you don't perfectly possess in one week, while trying to find a sense to a song that has none. Maybe then you will realize why this week specifically was not as good as the other, where contestants chose their songs.  I am very sorry to have disappointed you so much that you felt obligated to comment."
LSFYL,2d7d4b,TheHarperValleyPTA,3,Mon Aug 11 21:43:45 2014 UTC,"I thought I would critique the others since I have already displayed my love disgust for joans amazing video.   Harper - Your video was good and your sync was tight! I think why some people don't quite understand the concept is because your gestures and movements where the same with both characters - not allowing us to identify theyre different people? Other than that I think you have amazing talent and can't wait to see what you pull out next week :) Gemini - Given the circumstances you had to go through, your sync was one of the best ive seen - and thats what matters considering its a lip-syncing competition. I really hope certain people arent putting any doubts into your head because you truly can work it out. Zoomyx - This video was okay, your sync was a little off at times but I dont blame you because the song was incredibly hard. However you still sold it to me and thats what matters!    GREAT work top 4, really love all the work you have done!"
LSFYL,2d7d4b,LSunday,3,Mon Aug 11 15:24:09 2014 UTC,"the point was supposed to be that they were the same people! I interpreted Cold War to be two equal and opposing forces. I sometimes feel like I have all these different parts of myself that don't always mesh well. There's light and dark, good and bad, masculine and feminine. So I wanted to put these different parts of myself against one another. ""I was made to believe there was something wrong with me"" is how each side feels when things don't fit together the way it seems like they should. In the end they realize they aren't opposing forces but part of the same whole. That was what I was going for but it was definitely too abstract to translate well so I definitely get why people are confused. A vid should be able to stand without a long ass explanation hahahaha. Thanks for your support, and I'm around to bring it next week <3"

LSFYL,2d7d4b,ThePrincessEva,3,Tue Aug 12 02:20:02 2014 UTC,"SO!  It appears that someone was too lazy to do a CK review this week.  (I wonder who that could be?).  So, to tide you all over, I'll be giving you guys a quick overview of my thoughts this week.  GeminiGaga: This week, I looked at your video and thought ""You look pretty.""  Two pretties from me.  HarperValleyPTA: With two of you, you gave me 2x the pretty.  Two Pretties for you.  joanwaters: PRETTY, FUCK YEAH.  2 Pretties.  zoomyx: Even though you didn't love the song, you're always pretty.  2 Pretties from me.  AND THAT'S IT FOR THIS WEEK'S EDITON OF THE PRETTY REVIEW."

I would sooner lock myself in a cellar and slowly die of dehydration than watch either of them again. If a worse video exists on the internet, much less a worse PAIR of videos, I will slowly peel all of my skin off.   You got my number 1 vote this week."
LSFYL,2d7d4b,Mo399,4,Mon Aug 11 20:45:03 2014 UTC,"hahahahahaha Eva, I love you. Thanks for keeping it real."

You can't just draw on some tattoos and do a split screen honey you're not in Kansas anymore. I'd start planning like yesterday because if you want to make it to the top 2 you're gonna have to be cuter than zoomyx and more amazing than Joan, which is a tall order. And this ain't Starbucks"

Flat out amazing. Go the fuck to RPDR.  I am very torn this week. Only Joan really amazed me. Harpers was solid but a tad boring... zoomyx was not as tight as usal... Gemini was stressed and not full-power...  I think I'll have to go with a little sympathy then. And I think everybody knows who my favourites are. BUT. I want everything from whoever will be Top 3 next week. I really love all of you guys and you all deserve the Top 3 spot. Give your best performance."

LSFYL,2d7d4b,mrzfv,5,Mon Aug 11 17:58:30 2014 UTC,"Well, like I said in the other comment, even though i'm the only one left who isn't one of the never-been-in-the-bottom people, doesn't mean there hasn't been weeks where I haven't been in the top while the others have been Safe, so I don't think past record makes it entirely clear who is moving into the top 3. & if I hadn't broken my laptop, I could've done my original concept for this song but, atleast if I get eliminated, i'll get eliminated because the others had video editing or prop realness that everyone loves and mine was 'merely' me moving my mouth."

This was one of the most fun experiences I have ever had the pleasure of being a part of. I am so proud to have made the Top 5 alongside such talented competitors all season long. And like Bendelacreme, I walk away with my head held high, a tangled wig, and a long ass message for Gemini to wipe off talking about how the Mayan Calender has a missing chunk and we are still all doomed. 2019 people, SEEK THE TRUTH!!1!1.  Ariel, I specifically wanted to say to you that you are such a wonderful human being. Such a talent and you helped guide and continue to guide this comp into all the right places. Be so proud of how fun and intense you have made this season! You are a star to me. Also, I don't know what song was playing in the elimination video this week but I was  jamming out hard.  I just wanted to give a big thanks to the anyone who voted for me all season or enjoyed my videos. Your support was what kept me going. I thank YOU! #TeamBedDead  Moneyhenny, you are an inspiration.  As for me"

I love making videos and hopefully I'm entertaining all of you! I feel like I'm growing so much because of this competition and it really brightens my day to be ranked first in a field of such amazingly talented performers.  I could not be more thrilled about this.  And big thanks to ForestfortheDraois! Mama's gonna treat herself to something creepy on Amazon! (Maybe The Fly! Maybe The Descent! Probably makeup though!)

You definitely had some videos that I thought didn't deserve to be in the bottom at all (in fact, in one case I thought you deserved to win), and I think that just goes to show how very talented this season is. And for you to make it all the way to the Top 5? That says a lot about how much talent you possess.   I hope you continue to submit carrion videos. And I definitely hope to see you back in All Stars.

LSFYL,2cphs1,LSunday,6,Tue Aug 5 17:48:56 2014 UTC,"Gunna throw my two cents in about lip syncs in general.  Not sure if anyone else agrees, but here it is: I think performances should be enjoyed aside from the rules.  By that I mean, if you can't see someone's mouth for intermittent points in the song that equal a small portion or if the song doesn't quite match the theme, if it's still a good song vote for it/enjoy it.  Some people get a little wrapped up with the rules and they're not looking at the videos as a whole.  Sure, I agree that if you can't see someone for most of the video or if the song is waaay out there, then fine, it's not working in this competition.  I liked zoomyx's effect, even though it obscured his mouth for a little bit.  I don't assume his lip sync went to shit while that happened."
LSFYL,2cphs1,ForestfortheDraois,4,Tue Aug 5 18:44:04 2014 UTC,"I neither said the lip-sync went to shit or was bad.  You'll notice that he got 2 Keeps from me.  No one makes a perfect lip-sync; there are goods and bads in every single video.  I'm critiquing the competitors as we go into the final weeks.  So, I'm going to point out some of the weaker parts of a video.  For example, the effect Zoomy used was effective for his sync, but it did obscure his mouth which is the core of what they are being judged on.  Ideally, he could use that effect while still keeping his lips visible.  I think you need to be aware that when we are critiquing a video and we point out something that we think didn't work, we're not saying it's the biggest crime against humanity and it's terrible.  We're saying watch out for it next time to make your syncs even better."
LSFYL,2cphs1,ForestfortheDraois,3,Tue Aug 5 18:53:13 2014 UTC,"Woah, woah, waoh, I am not starting anything.  I didn't say you said ""it went to shit"", I was just saying that I've noticed quite a few people getting really stuck into the rules.  This was actually a generalized statement for anyone reading.  It just struck me as I was watching yours that I had seen it elsewhere and wanted to say, ""Chill...like it if you like it.  Voting doesn't have to be based purely on technical merits."""
LSFYL,2cphs1,ForestfortheDraois,3,Tue Aug 5 18:57:06 2014 UTC,"If you want to make a comment on generalized critiques, maybe it's better to make it in the thread where all the critiques are, instead of an isolated comment chain where the majority of the group you're referring to are never going to look."

LSFYL,2cphs1,Nightmoo,3,Wed Aug 6 00:41:49 2014 UTC,"You should be so happy with how you makeup is coming along! Seriously; go back to your past weeks and look at the difference.  Now that almost everything is correct, you just have to refine & build technique.   Them bobs looked good. i personally think you could have extended the line up a bit more to give more of a sphere shape. Also highlighting is needed and more blending inwards. Eyes are looking better. I do think that where your new eye lid ends, you need to draw in more of an eye socket using a brown. This also helps blending the eye rather than having the 'harsh' lines. Brows look good. Liner looks good. BUUUUUTTT!!! Where are your lashes girl?! Two weeks in a ROW are not acceptable. You can literally get a pair for like $1.  Lips could have more of a cupid's bow, rather then being rounded. Don't be afraid to draw outside your natural lip line.  Face is going good. Everything is right, but i just think you should get a contour colour less 'tan'. When looking for deeper foundations, its a thin line between browns and tans. Choose wisely.  It can be avoided all together by switching to powder contours rather than creams.  -ShuShu"

LSFYL,2ck4c8,thelettergii,4,Mon Aug 4 20:25:01 2014 UTC,"I think if the point of Out of the Hat is to have the audience request songs from the contestants, this was the perfect way to do it. It gives anyone who requested songs more of an opportunity to have one of their songs chosen. The fact that we didn't know it would be chosen this way really just means no one could ask two friends to pick a song for them, because then it's just another Queen's Choice week.  If the point of Out of the Hat is to throw off the contestants by giving them a challenging song that they themselves would not choose, I think it would be better served if the format were having the contestants choose songs for their competitors. But while I love the idea of the shade/challenge that would then present, I also really do still like the audience involvement aspect of this week.  If the point is to have a random song, do we really need audience participation at all? The host could put their iTunes on shuffle.  I think the real idea of Out of the Hat is a combination - to have the audience put in something they think would be challenging and/or different from what they've seen, but I'm not sure that's quite how it works out in reality.  Like I said, I think the selection method was the best way to handle this week - if it's about audience participation. Chris did what he could to make sure the maximum number of audience members got to see at least one thing they wanted. And from what I understand, there was still an element of randomness to the selection of songs for anyone who didn't have duplicates.   idk, I didn't vote at all last season and I'm extremely new to not-lurking this season, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the point or the way things have happened."

LSFYL,2ck4c8,ThePrincessEva,6,Tue Aug 5 20:07:20 2014 UTC,"dOrPanthera: A concept that doesn't need accessories to be clear and concise is a strong concept. You were the only one who went in barefaced and didn't use makeup to accentuate your idea, which I feel worked in this concept. My only issue is that it was somewhat inconsistent when you matched the whispering of the song to your mouth. Sometimes, it's on and looks like it really fits. Other times, it looks like the lip movements are from talking.  One thing I really liked is that, instead of being something people are scared OF, you were the one who was scared. It's a nice departure from what most people would go for. This is another note I liked: you didn't lose energy despite laying down. That's really hard, and though the song is chill, it would be noticeable if you didn't have energy. Overall, I love how different this is from every other video this week, and I think you did a great job. My tip for you is to continue thinking through your concepts. You did well this week with yours, I want to see you constantly innovating because it'll only help.   TheHarperValleyPTA: I just gave dor props for doing a stripped-down performance. Imagine how happy I was to finally see you do a video without makeup!   So obviously the look is there, the concept is there, and the energy is where it needs to be. Those are never in question with you. My issue this week is with the fact that the performance and song aren't especially dark. The look puts it in that category, but even turning the lights off would've helped it fit the theme a lot more. I'm not gonna say it doesn't fit the theme, though, because I think it does. It's just one of the more loosely connected ideas of the week. In the end, it's a matter of how different people interpret themes, which is one of the best things about this competition.   Something I really loved is how you got into the character. You fully committed to this idea, and that is always something that helps any performance. The way you moved your hands was the closest we were gonna get to a full-on head rotation, and I'm down with that. If you had vomited green peas and pissed on the floor, it would've been a perfect impersonation.   Overall, another great performance and a top mark this week. My tip for you is, since we're getting so close to the end, to think of the ideas you've sort of discarded throughout the competition and see if you can update them/make them work for next week.   zoomyx: Remember when Charlize Theron made herself real ugly to play that one serial killer bitch?   Anyway, I really liked your concept and performance this week. They meshed really well. Your video effects started out fine, and fit the song somewhat, but they really obscured your face. Like Harper, I have to give you credit for keeping the character and committing to it. It seems like every week, people are developing their concepts and becoming more confident in them. Which is good, cause we're almost at the end. I'll also note that my request last week for was you to commit, so I'm glad you did that.   My issue here is that this is a character/concept you've done, in a different manner, before. It's not really a knock on your originality. But like with Joan and camp, it's not that you ONLY do serial killer, just that it's something people are able to predict.   Overall, a very positive opinion on this one. My tip for you is to hold back more with the video editing. It's a great tool, but you've proven you don't need it.   joanwaters: This was the only video that actually creeped me out. With dOr, he was the one getting scared. With Harper, it was light on the horror aside from the look, and with zoomyx I was immediately aware it was him playing a character. Here, you opened with that super creepy shot, and from there it just got more and more uncomfortable.   I loved this so much. I really don't have much of a critique, I feel like it's a super solid performance that gives technical prowess and a fantastic interpretation of the theme. I love that it's hard to see where you really are, and how trapped you come across as. The fact that we can almost, but not quite, see your eyes adds a lot as well.   My tip for next week is to take that song and turn it into an EVENT. Bald eagles, stars and stripes, everything you can think of. Over the top is what's best for a song like that.   GeminiGaga: Oh wow, I didn't expect for you to play that voicemail I sent you....  I feel like the best parts of the performance were when you were at the ""Drink/Don't Drink"" lyrics, where you started to really come across as crazy. The other parts were more mellow than I'd like. The longer the song went, the more momentum you gained in coming across as unbalanced, and it had a great ending.   I really like how you acted the 'deeper' voice in the song, a nice contrast between the moody, apathetic main vocalist was really good in a song that got repetitive. That's my big note for this week, doing a song that was very same-y and not changing it up as much as you could.   My tip for next week is to REALLY play up the differences between the two singers. I know bright, peppy, and ditzy isn't something you do a lot of but I think you can match Glinda's energy. Elphaba should be fairly easy for you, in comparison."

LSFYL,2ck4c8,AgentFear,6,Mon Aug 4 04:51:43 2014 UTC,"Alright it's been a while since I've done reviews so I'm just gonna get right into it  dOrPanthera: I like the song choice you made and you performed it well by delivering the energy that a Cure song should have and the sync was on point as always, so it was overall really well done and produced, however, when compared to you competitors who went with more over the top concepts, yours seemed safe, which at this point of the competition, you can't really afford to do.   HarperValleyPTA: You are giving me eternal life with that Exorcist look, you looked pretty much exactly like Linda Blair did in the movie so kudos to you. In addition, your song choice fit the look you had perfectly as well and you carried it throughout and this one of my favorites you've done in this competition. Great job overall!  Zoomyx: ...wow. Just wow. You gave me EVERYTHING I wanted from this week. You killed the sync, the setting was the right amount of ominous, and I'm pretty sure one of those creepy ass dolls winked at me. It was so good and creepy and to add, your makeup this week was the first time you've done Ugly Ugly makeup as opposed to others who do Ugly Pretty and you just made it work to your advantage! Jolly Good Show! #TopToot of the week  Joan Evian Aguas: You were another one who did something I was not expecting this week by covering your pretty mug, but like I've said to you before, you give terrific mouth so you carried it exceptionally well and made it work for you. The sync was on point and you delivered yet another standout performance. Good work!  GeminiGaGa: The song choice was interesting to me because at first listen it sounds very club music, but I watched it a second time and man that song is dark, and I even grew to like it. Your look was also very well produced and kudos on the lipstick smear, that was a nice little addition as well as you actually drinking the Kool-Aid and dying...and coming back from the dead like a little drag zombie, that was cute. Overall, it was solid and you did an awesome job this week.  In the end, I have to give this week to Zoomyx with his Charlize Theron inspired look and creepy as hell concept that he did as well!"

LSFYL,2ck4c8,dOrPanthera,6,Tue Aug 5 23:31:29 2014 UTC,"The Ferocious 5. Dark and fierce is what Ariel Italic asked for and dark and fierce is what you better deliver!   I also want to say this: I really respect and appreciate all the effort that everyone has put into their videos, week after week. I know it can't always be easy and it's certainly a fantastic endeavor to partake, but it's a contest and it's getting tight.   Now on to the observations:   d0rpanthera: The lighting and basic visual here was great! I completely get what you were trying to convey here, the song lyrics and the subdued performance, but.. and I hate to say this..  I don't think it hit the mark as perfectly as some of the other videos this week. I didn't get that fierce aspect from this video that I believe Ariel was asking for and what I, personally, was looking for.  TheHarperValleyPTA: Your makeup and performance were giving me exactly what I wanted. The reveal was dynamite. I love the reference to the Exorcist in your look and the song clearly made sense to the whole thing. My only complaint, and you already know this, is that I wish your video was literally darker! I think it would have added that extra ""oomph!"" Zoomyx: This is incroyable!! I am a huge fan of Happy Together and this version was perfect for this theme, the effects didn't take away from the actual chorus and it was all very unexpected. I can safely say you were not cute this week! ;) You brought a very disturbing look and it was SUPER EFFECTIVE! Top vote for me.  JoanWaters: Your look was dynamite. Love this performance! You clearly stayed away from camp and delivered a very creepy video. It had me intrigued, like it was telling a story that I couldn't figure out, with you being tied up in the beginning and the hose on your head. Props on your song choice, as I love Polly by Nirvana (by way of Amanda Palmer). GeminiGaga: I never heard this song and I really liked it! The song's content is clearly dark and you were serving the fierce. I really liked your makeup this week, too! However, I feel like the performance itself wasn't dark! At this late stage, people are going to pick apart every single little thing because the competition is the best of the best at this point."

LSFYL,2ck4c8,Zoomyx,6,Tue Aug 5 22:52:50 2014 UTC,"Okay some random thoughts  Dor- Not sure if lying in bed is ever that great a concept, and I'm worried for you because of said concept, but you delivered said concept to the best of its abilities and I like you too much so you can't leave.   Harper - Good lord harper, lmao.  That was unexpected, and frightening.  Which this week is perfect.  good song and makeup combo.   Zoomy - jeez you guys really took this theme further than other themes my goodness creepy vibe successfully pulled off. Tho the intro threw me off cause the mouth syncing was a teensy off right off the bat, but caught up quickly. Also the effects were great but were a teensy hard to see through sometimes. but well acted throughout and again looked perfect and super creepy.   joanwaters- good in concept and presentation, I was worried about not seeing your eyes, but just barely being able to see them totally worked.  A little less creepy then I was expecting actually, but I kind of liked it as is, fit the song.   gemini- I guess after some of the others I expected more creepy? but the makeup is awesome, but with the upbeat-ness I think this one would have benefited from not sitting. But it was a good seated performance nonetheless, and liked the ending.  Also, metaphor aside, now I want kool-aid, lol.   All in all way creepier than I thought it would be lol.  And also, I know I don't follow this THAT closely, but the songs from a hat seem like the most random songs ever, especially as a group lol."

LSFYL,2ck4c8,joanwaters,5,Thu Aug 7 02:35:41 2014 UTC,"Top 5 Time!  dOrPanthera- I think your actual sync was pretty good and you pulled off that angsty pale vibe I always get when I hear the song. I think this is really good on its own but compared to your competitors, it gets a bit lost. There is over a minute of you just kind of lying there and my admittedly short attention span was waiting to get the ball rolling.   Harper- Giiiiirl, you NAILED it. I might actually say this is your best performance to date. I've always thought the creepiest part of The Exorcist was Regan's smile while she was possessed so I fully understand your concept and your execution. Awesome job, milady. Oh and by the way I know you're currently dealing with a 'can't please everyone' type of dilemma but to me this is the best of both worlds <3 So, you made one person super happy :)  Zoomyx- Noooooooooo, where is Olaf my adorable snowman?! YOU ARE SCARY. I liked that your concept was less 'horror' and more 'I am a crazy lunatic and I am going to kill you'. It felt like a deranged love song from a stalker or something. I think your effects aided you this week although I s'pose my one piece of advice now is that you have to outdo what you've already done for us. Big shoes, etc.   Joan- I dunno if anyone else felt this way but I was anxious to see what you would produce this week seeing as how 'dark side' seems as far from your aesthetic as humanly possible. I'm really psyched though, I think you did a fantastic job. I will agree with the masses in that some of the 'creep' factor was lost when you opened your eyes but it's still one of my favorites this week.  GeminiGaga- You definitely had a look and a concept so I applaud you for that but I don't know if the overall execution is as strong as some of your competitors. If this was a little bit earlier in the competition I'd say you had nothing to worry about because it's GOOD, it's just not... slightly less effective than a few of the others. I agree with the critique that you needed to build momentum.  I voted for 2 of the following- Harper, Zoomyx, Joan."

Weak ass shit, tryin to come up in my house.   dOr: I love you, and you're a standout performer, but a relatively low concept synch on top of another historically unpopular slow song? You have all the right emotion in it, and you have all the right movements, but I am super worried about how you're gonna do this week. The idea was great, if not kind of a little lost in the rest of it with a shirt that kind of blended into bedspread, and you did have like the right feeling and the right fear, but I don't think it's enough to get good amounts of voters, especially with the decreased amount of votes kicking in. I hope you get into next week, because I know you deserve to be top four, but I need you to take the stellar performer you are on stage and bring him over here. Please. Ella: I cheated because I saw this early, so I can easily get this in before my benadryl kicks in and I'm back to being useless like some fucking Cinderella knock-off. Insert joke of you having a natural look this week here So I think this is the best makeup job of the week. (most) Everyone went creepy, but you went full Hollywood Movie Your Mother Sucks Cock On The Casting Couch realness. It feels a little more unprofessional, videowise, than previous entries, but to be fair that's mostly from being spoiled by the shit you've done recently. The song's content made your smile a lil' strange throughout it, but I didn't mind too much. I mentioned it, but to put it down in my official review to let Others know of my unwanted opinion, I liked your teeth better when you showed them on camera. Of course then afterwards you told me that the teeth was done with food dye which meant they were inconsistent, so I might as well mention that for the Others too. A solid performance all around, though. Otterbox: Hm. Well, look and concept wise, you're the most put together look this week. Emotion wise, you're... Well, you feel kinda weird to me. The verses are less tired/calm/subdued/quietly sinister than the voice suggests by far since you look like Harper standing in line at chipotle, and during the first chorus, the effect doesn't really hide that you're kind of not doing much of anything or really getting into the right facial configuration until like the end of the chorus. You do hit it a bit better with the second chorus, though. Kind of surprised you didn't end the last ""You and me"" part way way way closer to the camera. Would that have made people uncomfortable? Probably. Would that have heightened the effect? Definitely. Is this mostly personal preference on my part? Sure. But it's kind of unfortunate that the only real chilling part of the song when you're playing a serial killer is when you run your hand through your hair at the end of the first chorus. Joan: I would have been completely 100% in love with this look... If I had not been able to see your eyes. It's an extra bit of humanity in a look that's more inhumane than anything else, and the times when I can't see your eyes because you're closing and leaning back, just making it look like there's nothing there, are the best parts visually. Synch wise, I think you went too big early on, which was a problem when you needed to start screaming and there wasn't much of a distinction between you talking and screaming like your life depended on it. I would have loved to see you freak out in all directions with the yelling too, but I'm me you're you we're a happy adopted family because we're gay and that's what family means. I do like that this is a bit of a drastic change for you, and you're trying to prove that you can go out in different directions. Because you definitely can. Gemini: Kind of... The most radical interpretation of the theme. I mean granted yes, it's up to the individual performer to interpret the more subjective themes however they wish and there's no real wrong way for the theme to be interpreted, but it's strange judging you compared to the entries for everyone else. I am glad you picked a song that's presumably more slightly more personal than the other choices, that's assuming that Otterbox doesn't kidnap and murder random people but let's go on that assumption. I am kind of disappointed that you're sitting down for this one, since you already have issues with being physical when performing that people have commented on numerous times. A good bitch powerwalk with a cameraman friend would have been stellar, but as I always say literally every time I try to inject my own personal tastes into how someone should be doing their lipsynch, I'm me and you're you and we've all got different ways of performing. The look was less stellar than I hoped, considering this is your wheelhouse. It looked kind of dark, but it also just kind of looked... incomplete. Video quality wise, I think you're kind of lagging behind the other competitors. Next week, if you make it, you need to step it up. I know you're talented, and I know you can make a terrific performer, but you need to bring that performer out soon otherwise you're not making top three.   Spoiler warning, wrote these in order of Dor, Gem, Benadryl, and Everyone Else because I'm professional and I take my knockout pills in the middle of writing  My top three this week, in no order, is Otterbox, Harper, and Joan. Dor and Gem, whoever makes it to next week needs to bring it, because nobody has anymore third place votes they can give to help people out."
LSFYL,2ck4c8,KHRoxas,2,Mon Aug 4 07:42:04 2014 UTC,"I actually disagree with you on this. The effect  IS part of my video, i'm not hiding behind it. I didn't use the filter to hide the fact that i didn't move a lot, I didn't move a lot BECAUSE I knew i'd use the filter. When filming i knew i'd use this kind of effect, so I couldn't move too much during the chorus mostly because it would already be hard to see my mouth, so if i moved too much it would be literally impossible to read my lips. I also had a version with a knife in the second chorus, but it felt too ""heavy"" with the filter and I had to chose between the knife and the effect.   About the emotion, I guess the verse is debatable and I could have done it the way you suggest. I don't know what you were expecting emotion wise for the chorus tho. And yeah, going very close to the camera would have been a good thing. I just didn't think about it, you're making it sound like it was obvious.  Anyway, thanks for the review and for putting me in your top 3."

Thanks for the head movie my dears :-)  /u/TheHarperValleyPTA, Regan realness to the 10th reminded me a lot of the look that Natasliah died on PerfectAndrogyny a year ago and that's a good thing.  /u/dOrPanthera your take on this Cure classic honestly doesn't do much for me. It lost a lot of the uneasiness of the original video and basicly is you turning around in bed. The sync itself was on point.  /u/GeminiGaga I liked the Jackie Beat reference in your makeup :-)  That sayed if you'd do it again add some dark purple to it to give it a bit more dimension next time.  The song, well, Natalia Kills isn't exactly what I call dark (darkish maybe). If your video got a story line (besides the schizophrenic nature of the character) I missed it and I watched it twice. This is exactly what I feared would happen. You got one uped in concept , in looks and performance.  Anyways I have to vote to keep you as I really want to see you performing “Popular”.  Top 3, the usual suspects Harper, Zoomyx & Joan."

The series follows the exploits of a criminal profiler working with the FBI's fictional Violent Crimes Task Force based in Atlanta, Georgia.  Ally Walker starred as profiler Dr. Samantha Waters during the first three seasons (1996–1999), and was later replaced by Jamie Luner as profiler Dr. Rachel Burke during the show's final season. Robert Davi, Roma Maffia, Peter Frechette, Erica Gimpel and Julian McMahon co-starred throughout the show's run. Caitlin Wachs played Dr. Waters' daughter for the first two seasons, a role taken over by Evan Rachel Wood in 1998.  Profiler shares a similar lead character and premise with the Fox Network series Millennium, created by Chris Carter. Both shows premiered at the beginning of the 1996–97 television season.

LSFYL,2ck4c8,TheHarperValleyPTA,3,Tue Aug 5 22:51:08 2014 UTC,"My Frightening Five. Last week as our Big Brother idea missed the mark and some of you showed signs of homicidal tendencies. We have changed the format only slightly to help capitalize, I mean, help you channel your murderous rage. This, is Fear Factor: Ariel Italic's Basement edition.  You were tasked with giving us some fierce with a taste of darkness. Will you let the darkness consume you? Or will you be like that bitch Carol Ann and run towards the light? Let's put on our nightvision goggles and see what we scare up.    d0rPanthera  Overall: insertjokeaboutnotknowningnoahkstillbeinginthecompetition. There were parts where you gave us that serial killer look you are known for and it helped the sync but those bits were a bit few and far between. I like the lighting and the look you are going for. However, laying down is doing you no favors. The energy was low, but it kept with the song. You get too into your own head and scared yourself more than you scared your viewers. You're becoming your own saboteur.  Where I feel you can improve: There was over a minute and a half of dead air in this sync. You could have done something during this time, be it slow moving until you are facing the camera, having some sort of nightmare or even syncing the whispers in your sleep. Just something to fill that space. I didn't feel a lot of energy in this, but again it's likely due to the fact it's a slow song. Be mindful of when the song comes back in, you lost the opening bit of the 2nd verse due to you watching your fingers drum out the high bit. You need more confidence in yourself. That fearful look at the end did not seem like something you put on for the sync. I think it might be genuine. You need to come out firing on all cylinders next week.  Closing Remarks: If you make it through to next week and I am not sure that you will. You need to deliver on the song chosen for you. No excuses, no nothing. Show these people that you still deserve to be here. That it wasn't due to having those who were lower energy still being  in the comp that made you stand out more by comparison. You need to show fight, and with this video I'm not getting that at all. I personally see this as you throwing in the towel. That's not something I wanna see from the Top 5. We can want it for you as much as we want but YOU have to be the one to want it as well. Don't go out on performance like this, it would be insulting to the other performances you've done and insulting to how you've grown through this competition. If you do go out, go out fighting. You need to go full force for the remainder of this competition.    TheHarperValleyPTA  Overall: I am glad you didn't go with the bed concept. So glad. Loved the make up. Sync was alright. I felt a little more could have been done to give it that darker feel. Could have been a bit more angier in some parts, kind of a Happy look to ya.  Where I feel you can improve: This would have been a lot better had you used my lighting. The sync and look were there, it just lacked that extra bit to help sell it more. You could have put a little more force into it as well. You came off as a bit happy in some of the verses and while you can do happy homicidal, it didn't fit with this song. You have the sync down and are getting closer to fully realized concepts. For next week just kill the song you are given. Give us strong, confident Harper.     Zoomyx  Overall: Like this look, giving me Joker from Michael Keaton's Batman realness. No smoking. You always do creepy well. The lighting and make up, combined with your background help sell this completely. I'm used to the creepy so I wasn't scurred. But this was very well done, Cheshire Cat.  Where I feel you can improve: Only thing I can clock are your timing and mouthshapes. You missed a few words and I think had some improper mouth shapes for some of 'em. Just be careful with that. The ""Echoed Scream"" effect was good but there were very small bits where it obscured your mouth. It didn't affect the sync, but I'm still bringign it up.For next week, your use of props might help you as it's an OK GO song. I'll be interested to see how you tackle it.    Joan""Drown it in holy""Waters  Overall: That time ueh's junk became famous. I was a bit worried about you this week as you've given camp 6 out of the 8 weeks and while you did give us a little bit different energy in some of it. I was still worried. However you delivered creepy quite well. Possibly better than Zoomyx, which is a feat cuz bastard is crazy. The concept was good. Are those electric / gas meters ? Giving us FFX Anima realness.  Where I feel you can improve:  I agree with druid in regards to the seeing your eyes bit. The spots where you don't, it really sells the look but when you can it kind of loses the scare factor. if you do another sync like this in the future, same vein or similar, keep your eyes closed if your face is covered. Be a little more mindful of mouth shapes. You had some instances where it looked off. Sync was good and energy matched the song. You delivered a good performance. You better KILL the song for next week. All out, over the top. I will be sad if you don't kill it.    GeminiGaga  Overall: I loved the look and your paint. As always painted for the gawds. Interesting song choice. I felt you could have really let go during the ""Drink the Kool-aid"" bits. Gone full on crazy.   Where I feel you can improve: I feel this was a bit too subdued. This song had a good beat to it and that helped bring forth energy however you didn't seem to deliver on that energy. You could have played up the crazy bit a lot more during the ""Kool-aid"" bits and just be a little more crazy in general. Holding your head, hearing voices etc. I think this was a step back or two when compared to your past videos. For next week, you need to bring bright, bubbly and energetic [I'll take words meaning the same thing for $100..] Elphaba is more or less this. Give us more energy. Give us more feeling.  Closing Remarks: If you make it through to next week and based on this performance, I am not sure you will. You need to bring it. It's too late in the competition to be falling back to a laid back and possibly low energy sync. People have taken gambles on similar songs and they've not paid off. I want you to go all out for your sync next week. The competition is too close, what might have been passable week 2 will not keep you here week 9. You need to show us your drive, your fight. You've been one that has been said to lack drive when it comes to your syncs. No excuses, full force, all out for the remainder of the competition. We can want it for you as much as we want, but if you aren't wanting it to that degree or more, then it's just wasted energy.    My Fearful Five. We have seen the darkness within each of you, but will it the gamble pay off? I look forward to what ALL of you will bring to the table for next week. You all offer something different which is what makes this competition great. Keep fighting until the end!  As always, if you do not feel these critiques are helpful, please tell me and I will do what I can to improve them."
LSFYL,2ck4c8,mrzfv,3,Mon Aug 4 15:43:43 2014 UTC,"my thought with the happy look, as it's been brought up in a few critiques, is that regan is happy she is sick. she doesn't wanna be cured/exorcised! so for me, the ""I'm so sick"" parts were her kind of reveling in the fact that she was possessing a body and laughing about it. I get why it doesn't tranlsate, though"
LSFYL,2ck4c8,TheHarperValleyPTA,2,Mon Aug 4 15:54:20 2014 UTC,I'm sometimes off when it comes to getting the concepts. Either way it was still solid.

Thanks!"
LSFYL,2ck4c8,Letsshootthequeen,3,Wed Aug 6 02:18:35 2014 UTC,"Hey, I always send in my vote. My username is included with it. ;) Not that I wouldn't love to get double-counted but let's be real these two are moving on either way.  PS - Just put this up because I usually add some commentary but didn't have much to say this week. Reflexive comment.  EDIT: Now that I'm already talking though...haha. Harper - it was all the lighting on this for me. I felt like I could have seen all but one other of these five on MTV at 4 a.m. without a second thought, and you were a girl giving a great performance in great make-up in her bedroom in this. It was a little disappointing after the amount of work you put into production quality on your best videos - which I think this is still easily among. Great job, just a really unfortunate choice on the environment you shot it in. It was still very hard for me to leave you off."
LSFYL,2ck4c8,TheHarperValleyPTA,2,Wed Aug 6 04:21:06 2014 UTC,"the critiques during my ""production-heavy"" videos were that my editing and effects were taking away from my sync. This week people seem to be bothered that I don't have those things. I chose to do it on the floor of my bedroom because I was emulating the exorcist, and that's what made sense to me. With the lights off, my camera couldn't pick up my lips or makeup. Please realize that I can't please everyone, and I'm sorry you didn't like it."
LSFYL,2ck4c8,thelettergii,4,Wed Aug 6 17:39:47 2014 UTC,"I did like it though!! Was just saying that that's why I picked zoomyx and Joan over you in a photo finish really. :)  Yeah, to hell with the people calling out you guys for gimmicks or being production heavy. If you can watch 6 videos of amateurs doing nothing but lipsyncing, you need to get out more. Props to you for all of your great ideas throughout this competition."

LSFYL,2ck4cj,AgentFear,3,Mon Aug 4 15:33:11 2014 UTC,"Alexsomenumbersthatiainttypingout  Overall: I like the look, you've come a long way from the Raccoon Eyes you gave in your audition video. Your energy was alright and the song choice was good, as you usually do alright with the rock-like songs. You could have given us more though.   Where I feel you can improve:  Stahp. Just.. Stahp =P. I know you're tall, but you need to get your framing set up before you shoot. You were out for the frame quite a bit and we miss whatever your eyes might be expressing. You could have exaggerated your mouth shapes more than you did. It got a little better after the 2nd chorus or so, but you could have made them bigger. When you're doing a sync, it can help. If you want to give us crazy, then go full on. the look you had with the head down slightly, arms splayed out on the wall was good. You began with moving to the beat but after that there was nothing until the lyrics kicked in. You've gotten more comfortable with syncing and you've begun to find a sort of style. Keep working on it as these carrion sessions have done you pretty good."

LSFYL,2ck4cj,Babeford,3,Mon Aug 4 04:50:38 2014 UTC,"Babeford  Overall: LIVE FAST DIE YOUNG BAD GIRLS DO I-- Wrong song. I am loving this look. From the way you did your face to the blackened finger tips. Combined with my trademark lighting, helps just sell this completely.  Love the song choice, I'm surprised that FLO wasn't chosen more to be honest. I will echo Agent's sentiment that you being here has turned the heat up for the other Carrions.  Where I feel you can improve: I loved how you used the beat for some of your movements, jerky motions and the snaps. Would have liked to have seen some more of that. I appreciate your dancerly movements, but it caused ya to be off screen for a tiny bit. The ""assisted exorcist headturn"" was a nice addition however the beginning of it made you stop syncing and you didn't continue until you were facing the camera upside down. When you try for movements like that do your best to keep syncing as it can kind of pull you out of the moment. Your energy was great. Keep it going and let's see you rock your Song from a Hat next week!"
LSFYL,2ck4cj,KHRoxas,3,Mon Aug 4 20:06:48 2014 UTC,I'm so glad you did Carrion reviews! Thank you for that! Haha that head turn was definitely an overestimation of my long-gone flexibility. I'm glad you liked it over all tho!

I like the effect / filter you used to make it look like it was an old time film / dusty VCR or Video Tape. Sync was good and had good energy for how tight a shot this was.  Where I feel you can improve: Sync was good and movements taken did not sacrifice the sync. That being said I felt you could have given some bigger movement. I'd ask for a little more emotion but it can be tough when your mask is drawn on your face. You were looking down a bit, I don't know if was just to look away or if you were looking at something off screen. Be a little mindful of that. Other than that.

LSFYL,2c89kj,heychrisk,12,Thu Jul 31 11:00:25 2014 UTC,"Ariel Italic, you have changed my life forever. You have changed the world of homemade internet lip syncs forever. And like all my elders, I respect you.  But seriously, I want to thank everybody who's been a part of this. The people who voted to keep me around the past eight weeks, the people who've offered invaluable criticisms to help me grow in this new art form, and to the other competitors who helped raise the bar so much higher this season. It's been a great experience and even though I've basically not slept a Saturday or Sunday since May, this is one that I would recommend to any kids out there who might be thinking about auditioning for Season 3.  Between losing my teaching job and moving to a new city this competition has given me something to shoot for every week and it's given me a whole community of new friends and I wouldn't trade that for all the makeup gift cards in the world.  And Ariel, I'm sorry to have to correct you, but the G NEVER stands for ""Goodbye."" Only ""Good Luck.""  See you all in the carrion threads!"

And zoomyx... damn, if I had that voice I'd never stop talking. <3  as for the syncs:  joanwaters: Ahh I love it! What else is there to say. You bring it every week. You really have a knack for entertaining. You'll go far with this drag thing :)  zoomyx: Wow you gave it your all this week and it paid off! My favorite vid of your's by far!! :D I don't even want to think about the coordination you had to have to pull this off, the interaction between the vids was great.  HarperValleyPTA: I loved that vid so much!! Love the birds, love the dress, sync, everything!! I almost want a behind-the-scenes vid for this, I wanna see how you did the animation.. haha.  GeminiGaga: I liked it but it didn't really jump out among the rest of the vids this week. Kinda felt too similar to last week in terms of your acting and sync. But it's still good and I think you did a great job with the sync!  theGstandsforGabriel: Your getup had me cracking up, and I love the song. Another great week from you.  dOrPanthera: dat arm choreography. and your sync! Dang. Your's is my favorite this week :) Also my favorite vid from you so far.

Anyone throwing shade is eligible, including those in the carrion threads (so basically Top 6 + Eva, Babeford, and LSunday; hopefully I didn't forget anyone), so you can just PM me your Top 3. I'll post a comment with the winner when Chris announces the results on Thursday, so get your votes in by then!"
LSFYL,2bwygu,druidcandy,5,Mon Jul 28 17:46:34 2014 UTC,"Eh, throwing in my 10th place, highly uneducated two cents in. Partially because this is shaping up into the part where it's harder to pick out the individual ""weakest"" of the week and because fuck it.  Fuck it.  (Scoring the reads out of 10 at the end because I want to show off my high standards and like some of your opinions, they don't really matter)   Otterbox: People call you Zoomyx but that implies you're on the fast track to the top You tried to go super technical on this, and I can respect what it tried to be, and the lengths that you went to today to get it all completely done. I even understand that you work like, shit, three jobs or something, including your smash play ""Stick a tomato in your mouth to fix your toothache"", but you should not be trying to approach an entirely new kind of editing for your video at the last moment because that leads to the mess we're getting into. Visually the costumes were great nods to your competitors, but there were a few times that, either due to your video or you, ended up getting sloppy on the movements that looked like they were supposed to be group movements. I think if this was edited better, I wouldn't have to guess this is bottom three this week. Hope you're safe, broseph. 7/10, got a few zingers but nothing I'm writing home about. Joan: ""You're all librarians"", says the only one who wears glasses This is going to sound. Super nitpicky. But. It is the top six and you aren't looking at your camera. And with how big your eyes can get it it absolutely distracting from the rest of the synch and it takes viewers out of it. This is something I should be mentioning to Alex, not Joan ""common pick for top 3"" Waters. Everything aside from that was pretty stellar, although I'd personally go full diva singing instead of being a lush to go with how out of nowhere the song is in the original musical and in it's story, but we're different people and we all interpret shit differently hare krishna nammyste. 6.5/10, costumes were the best part. #BringBackDrunkJoan #NoChill GstandsforGabriel: Congrats, you're finally at the level of performance you think you're at You were missing the emotion the song is at with your face in a few parts, which is a problem when doing musical songs because they're naturally super fucking emotive, but you're stepping it up compared to previous weeks. The main problem is I wanted to see all this physicality a g e s ago, and we're at the top six. You can't sail by safely anymore, and if you make it into next week, you need to bring the same energy you brought into this with you. None of that Rainbow Connection bullshit. 8/10, some good moments but you are using jump cuts, this should be faster Gemini: Thank god, the inflated red wig isn't fuckin here I'm glad last week wasn't a false flag towards your improvement. It's not the so much so much that we've normally seen from you, but hell, if you're doing it right you don't need so much so much. The thing is, you're still a little behind in motion and relative unstiffness to your competitors, and we're nearing the point where if people can't bring it at the same levels consistently, they're gone. I know you have more in you, and I know that you're building towards it. I want to see you move forward, partially to piss others off because I enjoy human misery, and partially because I know you're talented as hell. 6/10, go into the tinychat sometimes, it is sooooo much easier to emotionally destroy people once you know what's going on in their lives. Dor: Because when you can't succeed as yourself, be someone else I'm so so glad we have someone impersonating UEH. I'm upset you were the only impression of a season one contestant, but beggars can't really be choosers. The thing is though, the arms and mouth got a little sloppy at times, which pushed it over the edge from a good impression to a great impression (#Shablablabla), but I think that's also going to get you in trouble from voters this week, who may or may not know what a UEH is or what it tastes like (grapes). It may have been an intentional stylistic thing, but being off like that intentionally is a bit of a gamble, especially at this point where you're either the best or the worst out of everyone. 7.5/10, and you were worried you'd be terrible at this. Harper: Harper, you can't be a princess, princesses are virgins So we've got our ~Technological Woman~ (sorry Erika) gunning for the title. The synch was a little off on my video, but I'm assuming that's indirectly the fault of all the hoops you jumped through for the birds. Could have been more visibly strained on the high notes, but you're everyone's favorite bad girl princess with an entirely custom look and this was a great entry. 8.5/10, funny and super cute, which I'm sure is the first time someone's described you with those words."

I kept the theme HEAVILY in mind when I did my rankings and tried to explain myself as clearly as possible below! Please don't be offended by anything I post as I love you all and think you're all amazing.  Zoomyx- I loved your concept and I think you pulled it off on its own very well. I can't say it was better than the original because comparing them is a bit like comparing apples and oranges. Hers was stripped down diva and yours was once, twice, five times the Zoomyx. Overall, I think this is one of the stronger submissions this week.  Joanwaters- When it comes to taking a season one performance and making it better? You nailed it. You definitely brought something more to the table for the song. I don't disagree with other claims about having seen this side of you before but I do appreciate that you did a lot with the theme.  TheGstandsforGabriel- I'm torn on this one. I don't know if I think it's 'enough' for this stage of the competition but I can't deny that I enjoyed your rendition more than its season 1 counterpart. So! Good job following the theme but I think you need to bring a little more to the table if you want to stand out.  GeminiGaga- I think your video works on its own (also, you're so so so pretty!) but when you compare it to Ms. Italic's season 1 effort... it comes up short. Her sync just has this casual, effortless fun feel about it. It was very ambitious to take on the work of the season 1 winner and I think it was a risk that didn't pay off.  dOrPanthera- At first I watched your video without context and I was scared of you. Now that I 'get it', I think you did a good job. It's tongue in cheek and a pretty spot on impression. I like that yours is the only video that pays tribute to its original.  HarperValleyPTA- I've been a big fan of yours from the start but I have to say this is a little disappointing to me. Conceptually speaking, you had a great thing going but Eggsrainey's rendition is SO spot on and stripped down... While it's great to see you making use of effects and costumes, I feel it's all a bit 'too much' and detracts from the sync.  Looking forward to this week's results... It seems like it's ANYONE's game."

LSFYL,2bwygu,GeminiGaga,2,Mon Jul 28 20:12:01 2014 UTC,"Thank you tacky :D I'm happy that you think it was one of the best submission, especially with all the amazing videos this week :)"
LSFYL,2bwygu,deliciouslytacky,2,Mon Jul 28 21:09:28 2014 UTC,"Well, I chose the song because I like the song, not because I wanted to show up Ariel. Even though its called ""Season 2 Superiority"", I didn't think ""Omg, let me pick an Ariel performance and try to show people i'm better than her."" because I don't think that. I just leaned more to this song than to any other song from Season 1 so I chose it. So, I will take the compliment on you thinking it works on its own, because thats how I want it to work. :P And thank you for thinking i'm pretty, that is too kind :)"
LSFYL,2bwygu,GeminiGaga,2,Mon Jul 28 21:35:12 2014 UTC,"That's cool, that's your interpretation of the theme! I just personally saw it as a chance to 'upstage' someone from the first season and I will be basing my votes strongly (but not entirely) on that. Like I said, your sync was good on its own but with regards to 'superiority', I didn't really get that.   Also you are still pretty (I hate making negative, argue-y posts)"
LSFYL,2bwygu,TheHarperValleyPTA,2,Tue Jul 29 00:47:58 2014 UTC,"No, no. Some of the themes are very up to interpretation so I totally get where you're coming from- no arguing required. I'm just not here to be shady or one-up anyone else in any sort of vengeful manner (Library is Open video, aside.) - I didn't want to have to make fun of Ariel or make her seem like something less than what she is to elevate myself above, I just wanted to do a song I liked and perhaps pay tribute to a lipsyncer I admire. I dunno."
LSFYL,2bwygu,RhondaOdyssey,2,Tue Jul 29 01:53:38 2014 UTC,"yeah, I definitely wasn't trying to recreate or show up Eggs' vid. I just wanted to pay homage to one of my favorites and use it as inspiration! I'm sorry you weren't feeling it."

LSFYL,2bwygu,TheHarperValleyPTA,5,Mon Jul 28 15:49:01 2014 UTC,"Thoughts:  On shade. Keep up the good work~   Special shout outs to Gabe and dOr for causing this reaction.  Syncs:  /u/zoomyx - Loved the idea and the execution. Your split screen effect worked even better here, and your timing was impeccable. Nice job!  /u/joanwaters - Here's to the ladies who lush. Literally nothing else to say except well done!  /u/theGstandsforGabriel - This is the breast I've ever seen you! Your sync was way tighter than last week, but I'm missing a bit of the emotion of the song. Overall, a good effort. :)  /u/GeminiGaga - Gutsy move, taking on one of Ariel Italic's greatest hits. I think you did well, but I wish you had moved around a bit more during the musical breaks of the song. Otherwise, I enjoyed it!  /u/dOrPanthera - Holy UEH-e-doublehockeysticks! It was like watching the real thing. Hilarious!  /u/TheHarperValleyPTA - Your hard work and dedication were especially evident this week. The production values were superb, and the song choice was great. I'm glad to see you continue to rise!  TL;DR: I voted for 3 of these people  /u/zoomyx, /u/joanwaters, /u/TheHarperValleyPTA, /u/GeminiGaga"

LSFYL,2bwygu,TheHarperValleyPTA,5,Mon Jul 28 05:50:25 2014 UTC,"Uh, I'll do critiques again, yeah! I'm not gonna be shady, though. I'm also not gonna comment on the shade videos since I don't think they're indicative of much and did not effect my voting. If you have any suggestions for Song Out of a Hat week for the Carrions, I will collect them for you! Send in suggestions for anyone, audition-week carrions, main competition carrions, or season 1 contestants. This is so if someone gets a suggestion they like, they can still send in something. Obviously nobody is required to do a suggestion they dislike.  Zoomyx: There are technical issues that you're already aware of. Some choppiness in the video, occasionally the corners get blacked out, but I won't talk about them much since it's something you already know. My issue with this is that, while you had good energy, the gospel tone of the song really encourages you to take it to CHURCH. Release the control of synchronizing all of the movements (which was very impressive, really!) and show us that uncontrolled side. I was waiting for that the entire video, but it never came. I know this critique sounds negative, but my overall impression of your performance was very positive. I just want to offer you my observations so you can really make everything perfect. My tip for next week, with its DARK SIDED theme, is to find a song that envokes a deep, powerful emotion that you can completely lose yourself and the performance in. All of your syncs have been very aware and composed, I want to see one where the level of control isn't that high.   joanwaters: This week felt like more of a step back for you. You're not looking at the camera, you're doing a lot of the same mouth/face movements, and it's a character/song choice that nobody would be surprised by. All that said, you are still the mistress of camp and you sold it completely, I was laughing and focused the entire time. As long as you have that energy and that face, you can sell any song. My recommendation for next week is to pick a song that is absolutely the opposite of people's perception of you. We think of Joan as campy, fun, crazy, and ridiculous. Go back to Slow Week and pull out that more subdued Joan, or go the opposite direction and give us evil, hateful Joan. Either one would work wonders.   TheGstandsforGabriel: girl that aint tracy turnblad that's julia child   This song is blissful and dreamy. Your face was very much the same as it usually is, neutral with a bit of a smile. You do musicals a lot so I'm surprised to see you being so subdued with your expression and energy. You put all of the interest and focus of the performance in your hands and arms, and that's not really what this song is. But for the good parts: You made the choice to go for drag this week, and it's one of your more memorable looks. Lipstick/gloss is a great idea for drawing attention and focus to the mouth in videos that aren't that close up- it's something that Joan and Harper take advantage of a lot, so remember that. Even if it's subtle, like enough to still be on the side of 'man', you can still get a lot of mileage out of it. My recommendation for next week is very much the same as Zoomyx's. We haven't really seen you do a lot of really strong emoting, so I highly recommend going for something that has either a lot of emotional meaning to you, or something that you can reasonably make up emotions for.   GeminiGaga: In a week of videos that were very good but didn't show much progress, you were the clearest example of someone furthering their performing skills. The connection to the camera is finally there, and as I promised it makes your expressions and mouth so much better. There were a few slip-ups with looking to the side, but I'm willing to overlook that because this gave me so much life. Taking on an Ariel video and delivering it like that takes a lot of guts and I feel like you made the performance your own entirely. My single critique is this: the jaw-wiggles and the crossed eyes and other things like that were fun and showed you letting loose. But they can get old, so just remember that. My recommendation for next week is, honestly, to just build upon what you've been improving. Find a song that works for you, and keep giving us this fun, vibrant Gemini that is so entertaining to watch.   dOrpanthera: Hands down, THE best and honestly only real impersonation of the week. You didn't just get the arm movements down, but the color coordination and even some of the facial expressions really helped make it clear who you were trying to impersonate. This is one of those performances that just gives everyone life and really turns up the fun when it's played. Which brings me back to last week's critique: you did exactly what I wanted! That instant moment of ""YES!!!"" that I got really sealed this performance in my mind, and thus downplayed the faults it had. Which, as much as I loved it, it did have. Sometimes I feel like you went TOO exaggerated with the mouth, and here's why. Exaggerated mouth works really well when you have to film at a bit of a distance, but when you're as close to the camera as you are, it doesn't read as well. I mean, it's Britney Spears so it's easy to see why you made that choice. Just remember to keep your distance to the camera in your mind. For next week, I don't have much to say. I really appreciate the way you take every critique and apply it, and it's strengthened your performances so much. My tip is for you, and this will kinda come out of left field, is to not worry about the technical things some of the other contestants are doing. They're very impressive, and can add a lot to a performance, but unless you have the time for it, you shouldn't worry about adding them to a video. If you get your concept down, learn the words, and are confident in your rough draft, then by all means try. But don't assume it's required.   TheHarperValleyPTA: Hoe White and the Seven Greenscreens. I'm not gonna comment on the technical issues, you've already addressed them and are working towards fixing that in the future, so there's not much point in bringing it up. I will say that it's very easy to tell where the mistake happened, and I can consciously place the lyrics to where you said them, so with some effort it's easy to tell that you knew the words. I really liked the concept, and the work you put into it. You always do such a great job of marrying concepts to costumes, and this week you really brought it together. Your video had more of an homage to your Season 1 counterpart than others did, though you and Eggs are pretty different in terms of performing. I feel like you should've done her more simplistic approach to the birds, since yours cost you a lot of time and in the end hurt your video with the way it effected the overlay. For next week, I encourage you to strip it back down for one video and do a non-technical video, while still brushing up on your skills.   If any of my critiques are vague/unhelpful tell me! I want to be of some assistance to you six amazing performers."
LSFYL,2bwygu,dOrPanthera,3,Mon Jul 28 06:55:47 2014 UTC,"Eva you know I don't have friends. WHO'S GONNA HOLD THE BIRDS?! as much fun as I've been having learning editing/production skills, I'll definitely be doing a simpler, performance heavy sync (okay, maybe some editing. I can't help myself). Thanks for your critiques!"
LSFYL,2bwygu,GeminiGaga,2,Mon Jul 28 07:09:03 2014 UTC,"Eva, you are fucking incredible. Such a kind and helpful critique. Thank you thank you thank you!  Totally over-exaggerated the mouth a bit too much and re-watched it going...damn. But the overall sync was better than the re-shoots so I let it slip by, but I like you calling it out.  Again, THANK YOU!"
LSFYL,2bwygu,KHRoxas,2,Mon Jul 28 07:10:31 2014 UTC,"I'm glad you liked this video. I really liked it and I had fun and was excited to be doing this song and that's what's important to me. I'm surprised I was the only one to do an Ariel sync, She is better with movement than I am but I just enjoy this song more than most of the other songs that were my choices so thats why I went for it & hopefully it'll keep me around another week. :) Thank you darling. <3"
LSFYL,2bwygu,Zoomyx,4,Mon Jul 28 07:28:09 2014 UTC,"My Sickening Six. The time has once again come for you to help Rainbow Dust clean her home. You may each pick a room and get started. Gabe, you are to start in the bathroom.  This week you were tasked with covering a song done by some of the season 1 girls. Will you succeed in making them relevant again ? or will you end up fading into the background ?  For this week, I am only critiquing the lipsync. I will not be critiquing the reading challenge. That said, start your editing software and may the person whom saves the most, win.    Zoomyx  Overall: I like how you did 5 separate syncs for this and how you were able to match them up. There were some oddities throughout. You weren't hitting certain mouthshapes, you'd miss a word completely or the ""flashing"" boxes would cause that part to be hidden for roughly 1 to 2 seconds and covering up any kind of issue that may have happened in that time. You put a lot of work into this and it does show. You just need to spend more time polishing it.  Where I feel you can improve: I know editing was your biggest issue this week as you were down to the wire trying to get everything set. Was the ""flashing"" boxes to keep that particular sync in time with the others? If so, it wasn't really needed for half the song. Your mouth shapes and hitting the words took a bit of a hit this week. There were words missed and some of it did look a bit sloppy. However, as there are 5 separate windows to look at, I'm certain no one else would notice. I can give you a breakdown of each part if you want. This is a lip syncing competition first and foremost. That bit absolutely needs to be there. For next week, spend a little more time with the lyrics and shaping of your words. If you have any editing ideas, get them down on paper and plan them out so you don't end up with an almost DQ like this week.     joanwaters  Overall: I liked the energy and face you gave throughout. There was only one iffy spot I could clock with this one. You embody that druken crazy aunt quite well. A true alchy doesn't spill her booze =P. I would be lying if I wasn't worried for you for next week.   Where I feel you can improve: The only spot I could really clock was around 0:58 ""As we stumble along"" the mouth shape you choose to take there you kind of lose the word ""along"". Other than that, there was nothing else that needed work in this video. Just be careful of when you bring your arm / hand / glass in front of your face. For next week, as you aren't allowed to do camp at all. You need to find a way to channel that energy that is used for over exaggerating your face and some of your movements into the sync itself. It's a dark and possibly serious week, depending on the route everyone takes. You've given us camp every week, save for maybe slow week when you sang to your mirrors. Give us something we haven't seen before. Make us say ""We can't believe that was Joan"" but in a good way. Godspeed you lush.    theGstandsforGabriel  Overall: Ariel, you really need to impose a time limit on this bastard. Was not expecting a draggy look from you. Even if it's lipstick and some boobsforqueens.com. I think you break that ""soulless"" look as you showed a little bit of emotion in this. Were you wearing a helmet or something ? I clocked something shining toward the end of the video and had not clue what it was.  Where I feel you can improve: You missed a few words or were late in coming in due to just missing it or choosing whichever mouthshape / action to take during that verse. At this point in the competition the sync needs to be on point. It is your foundation and if it's shaky the whole thing can crumble. High concept or not. Watch the wording. I'll be interested in what you deliver for next week.     GeminiGaga  Overall: Taking on Ms. Italic, some could see this as a very ""Oh no she betta don't"" move. However, this was good. You got into the song, gave some good energy and the sync. was. on. point. I'm glad that you kept eye contact with the camera as well, it wasn't a dead-eyed stare. I like how you handled the ""Somebody who"" section.  Where I feel you can improve: I think you could have make some of your shapes bigger especially when she really goes for those notes or at least some of the later ""Ooooh / Yeaaaaaah""s. You are enjoying yourself and it's nice to see. Next week as it's going a dark / serious route, it might be right up your alley. Just remember it's not a campy week and give us some dark Gemini.    d0rPanthera  Overall: When I saw you were doing UEH [ha] I got really worried as I had no idea where you were going to go with this. You brought a close UEH performance. Face, mouth and flailing limbs for days. I liked the little ""Mic"" detail from the beanie too. There were two spots where you almost looked like him too. I like how Sean's week 1 video is front and center once the video ends too.. Not really part of this crit. just funny to see him there.  Where I feel you can improve: The UEH was good. I felt you went a bit overboard with it at points and it did cause you to lose some words. In the beginning you were looking down an awful lot, what were you looking at ? Overall it was a good job. As always, make sure you watch your mouth shapes and are mindful of when verses start. I am worried for you for next week. Slow / serious has not been your strong suit so far. Both Slow week itself and what you gave us last week. Be very careful with your song choice and remember, no camp.    TheHarperValleyPTA  Overall: It's Lil Ho White~. Looks like you almost tripped during the opening turn. I liked the animation and helped tie your princess concept together.  Where I feel you can improve: I know that you too had issues with your editing this and it shows. There were points where the sync itself was there and it would match with the song and there were times where it was ahead of what you were doing. I'm sure the sync was there but it just got a little lost. Concept was good but concept alone will not save you, especially as we're in the final weeks of the competition. I do appreciate the time you put into this. For next week, if you have any sort of plans for editing / animation. Get it down on paper and get started on it. Next week should be a breeze for you.     My Sinful 6. You did good this week, some shone a bit brighter than others and next week we dive head first into the darkness. As always, I am proud of you and the work you continue to put out."
LSFYL,2bwygu,dOrPanthera,3,Mon Jul 28 15:08:50 2014 UTC,"The flashing boxes didnt block any of the lyricsm and it was needed for the entire song. I placed them at places where the video jumped: it lagged. If you look closely, yourealise that the black box doesnt ""hide"" the video, it ""pause"" it so the video can catch up to the song. The reason my sync is relativly following the music is because of those .5 seconds flashing boxes (around 9 for each character). Basically, since my video jumped and lagged, the video followed the lyrics and the music for a while but then skipped .5 second and was too far ahead. it happened many times during the songs (as you can see), mainly because i filmed AND played the music at  the same time on my crappy computer. Thee best way to explain the skipping is by telling you that the song is 2:18 minutes long, but the videos were 2:15 minute longs, meaning they slowly skipped a few seconds throughout the song. So yeah, the black boxes don,t block parts of my sync that could have been problematic, they only pause certain parts so the sync can catch up ;) Sorry if this is not clear, i tried my best to explain everything but I might have failed (screw english lol)  on the mouth shapes tho i agree. It was a real pain in the *** to remember where I was suppose to look, who did what part, when I was syncing and when I was just waiting, etc. Thinking about all of this definitly hurt my sync :P It's not that I don't know the lyrics, it's mostly that I probably tried to do to much at the same time :/"

LSFYL,2bwygu,theGstandsforGabriel,3,Mon Jul 28 05:58:22 2014 UTC,"The Sinister 6. You had to bring the shade as well as resurrect the song choices from Season 1. I will admit: With only six of you, I'm saddened that half of you decided to do musicals, tho.   Now on to the observations:   Zoomyx: Great video concept, great look and I really enjoyed your shade video. You're one of my top choices this week!  JoanWaters: Here's to the ladies who lunch, aren't they the best? I liked your video this week, Joan. Your performance was fantastic and your shade video was perfect to me. However, I must admit to being a little disappointed with your song choice. It was too obvious: we know you can rock this out already! theGstandsforGabriel: Gabriel in drag! I dig the look and the performance! There's nothing bad about your video. Your shade video was good, I like the Reading Rainbow introduction. However, I'm going to give you the same critique that I gave Joan: this song choice was too expected! See all the praise when you performed out of your box? (Fast Rap week, highest ranking) Consider that.  GeminiGaga: I really like that you went for an Ariel Italic song. No one else did, which surprised me. You've really grown as a performer and it seems you are even more comfortable in front of the camera. If you watched your second week's video and compare it to now, you'll see how much better you are now.  d0rpanthera: This was a very funny video and imitated your source material fantastically. The overexaggerated, flailing arms made me laugh but the sync was pretty good. Nice job this week! TheValleyHarperPTA: Fantastic shade video! Fantastic performance video! You sound like a Disney princess! Loved it ALL. You are coming to win, Harps. I'm loving it. You're one of my top choices this week!"
LSFYL,2bwygu,TheHarperValleyPTA,3,Mon Jul 28 05:30:08 2014 UTC,Well maybe we wouldn't all have done musicals this week if we'd had a chance before!  (love you Ariel your themes are the best)

(And I really hope Chris liked it and I did Miss Italic proud) I thought for sure someone was going to do Total Eclipse of the Heart with a sock puppet because that video (Well, for me anyways) is just so memorable.  Edit: Oh, and I definitely see how much i've improved when I go back to my old videos. Especially when I edited last weeks video with the montage intro."
LSFYL,2bwygu,TheHarperValleyPTA,3,Mon Jul 28 05:52:53 2014 UTC,"Hey, I just realized I didn't have time to post critiques last week. Oh well, y'all were great. Or terrible, since it's shade week.  Zoomyx: You put a lot of effort into the overall effect and the editing. It's clear what your concept is and it fits well with the song. It's immediately obvious who is who and I love the idea. But with a five-part song it isn't always obvious who is singing at what time which means on occasion one head will look like it is missing the lyric. And even if it isn't, it's hard to tell which does affect the overall illusion. I could talk about the blinks, but you know you could fix those with more time. The only note I have to say is that at this point in the comp you might be tempted to go big like this, technically and editing-wise, but you run the risk of having issues or even missing the deadline. Remember the fundamentals that got you here in the first place and don't try so hard to overreach on the extras.  Joan Waters: The camera quality was more akin to your earlier videos, which is a little step down in production quality (I only say this cuz you've proven you have the technology) but it works in a way given the busted character you're giving us. Your syncs are always extremely tight and the song feels like one you've been rocking out to forever. At this point in the comp, though, we expect this from you. But since next week is NO CAMP ALLOWED, no versatility critique from me today.  GeminiGaga: It takes balls to do one of Ariel's winning songs, which I commend you for. You're taking new and exciting risks as a performer and an artist and I think we all appreciate that. Sadly, though, I think your interpretation was a little too similar to Ariel's and the fact that you still went lower energy overall means that you didn't top her in the way that the other competitors did this week. It's an okay sync (tight, expressive) but if you're going to invite the comparison to another performer (Divine, Ariel), you need to make sure that the comparison is going to end with you on top.  dOrPanthera: First, I'm glad somebody did UEH. Second, I thought you nailed his mannerisms (uncanny, really) while managing to not lose yourself. It was clearly dOr AS UEH, which is a tough distinction to bring. Also you managed to keep it exciting on its own rather than have it be just all about shade this week. Keep an eye on that crazy chaos, though. Sometimes it gets away from you and we need to wait for you to come back to us. And I'm sure you will, next week.  TheHarperValleyPTA: The costume did a fair job of connecting the shade to the sync which helped it not to come off as inorganic, but for all the work and time it took you I wonder if you needed this to fulfill your vision or if you're trying harder than you need to in order to wow us. The animation is something I really appreciated as it helped sell the concept to us, but the fact that the sync is off (even if it is just in editing) makes the entire video suffer. Hours of work in animation helps, but I'm not sure if the pay-off of those birds was worth the damage it did to the fundamentals of what makes a good lip sync. Same general note as Zoom. This felt like a rough draft of a Top 3 sync (and if you put in another day of editing it would be). But in the current form it's a little incomplete."
LSFYL,2bwygu,theGstandsforGabriel,2,Mon Jul 28 05:34:03 2014 UTC,I'd rather try harder than I need to than not try hard enough.
LSFYL,2bwygu,TheHarperValleyPTA,3,Mon Jul 28 07:57:15 2014 UTC,"Your efforts are appreciated, but this week your focus on all the extra stuff hurt your sync. Your costume and animation were killer, but at the end of the day it's a lipsync competition and that has to come first.  Again, if you had another day or so this wouldn't even be an issue. But I have to bring it up, especially when there are more than one person who seem to be taking similar risks."
LSFYL,2bwygu,theGstandsforGabriel,2,Mon Jul 28 14:28:34 2014 UTC,"Again, I'd rather be trying new techniques and sometimes miss the mark than consistently produce boring, safe videos. Sure, it's a lip sync competition, but there needs to be an entertainment element there, too."
LSFYL,2bwygu,TheHarperValleyPTA,2,Mon Jul 28 23:38:18 2014 UTC,"I understand, though I think there's a happy middle ground to be found between taking a certain type of risk and being boring."

Will we see a side we've not see before? Will we see a character? Will we see wide, crazy eyes? Whatever you choose to deliver, give it your all and then give even more.

LSFYL,2blopy,theGstandsforGabriel,1 point,Thu Jul 24 23:50:00 2014 UTC,"it has the same number of columns as last season's, and I'm too lazy to bother changing it until I know exactly how many weeks we're gonna have (in case of another double or a non-elimination, though both seem unlikely at this point.)"

LSFYL,2b9lz0,Babeford,10,Fri Jul 25 05:17:26 2014 UTC,"Welp might as well critique now that I’m out! Take my critiques with a grain of salt as you are still in the running and I am not. Just gonna steal Khroxas’ template for critiques cause I’m unoriginal.   Gabe:    What I liked: Cute concept. The ‘outfit’ was a nice touch. You used musical breaks well to keep us entertained.    Where you missed the mark: This was probably your weakest synch I’ve seen. Lots of slip ups in this one and coming after last week I know you can bring it. I would like to see a little more variation in the face. It’s expressive but you give a deathstare at the camera nearly the entire time. Unless there was water in your eyes you weren’t blinking. Be a bit more playful with the camera, especially with such a poppy song.     Moving on:  Keep framing in mind. I’m sure you just wanted to get the whole shower head in the frame but there was a lot of dead space above your head that I was craving you’d use your hands to fill.        Joan:    What I liked: Loooove the juxtaposition of classical French to Iggy. The makeup is fierce and you look stunning. As always your syncing is effortless and you know your songs inside out.     Where you missed the mark: What bothered me about this vid was your tone. It might just be me but this song is more about calm, smug swagger and you were very angry and aggressive. You worked that angle but I definitely thought you would have done better using your signature charm and be a little more cocky.      Moving on: Don’t be afraid to be you. Keep stretching your concepts and you’ll go far!     Gemini:     What I liked: Such great energy! You look gorgeous as always. Glad you’re standing up, properly framed and trying a little dancing. Sync is tight as always and I love the Detox jaw you’ve got going on!    Where you missed the mark: I don’t quite get it? Are you chucking your wigs cause you’re trying to break out of just doing drag? I know you said you’re doing this competition specifically to work on your drag so I was just a little confused by you getting rid of your tools for your art. I’m blonde tho so take this with a grain of salt.     Moving on: Keep this momentum! You’re beginning to get your stride and the girls should be worried.     Shutt:    Shutt I can get arrested if you keep looking at me like that. Gat damn. Great emotion bb! You did me proud on that.     Where you missed the mark: I’ve never really enjoyed it when you had a camera man. I find it a little distracting when I just want to focus on you working your space but then you’re zooming in and out and up and down. I would have just loved this if you had stayed on the bed and writhed around in lonely agony (I’m on lists now but I had to say it). Moving on: Keep playing to your strengths with the emotion you can give me. Maybe lose the camera man.    Zoom:    What I liked: That look is fierce baby! The skit at the beginning was cute too. I loved your subtle dancing and musicality.    Where you missed the mark: Your energy dropped significantly about halfway through the song and it looked like you were running out of new ways to move. I think that’s the folly of repetitive songs because you have fewer lyrics to work with.     Moving forward: Be careful with your crazy costumes and props (beating a dead horse here). Sometimes I felt your look was stronger than your performance. Make sure they match each other evenly!    Harper:    What I liked: This concept was soooo great! I was worried when you were doing Kieza with your knee and I’m impressed you switched songs so successfully. Your facial expressions were great and the sync was on point. I think spoken word is a lot harder to do than rhythmed lyrics so props to ya mawma.     Where you missed the mark: You’re sitting so a lot of energy is lost. I would have loved to see you use your arms a lot more. Your left arm didn’t even come in frame til halfway through the song.    Moving forward: Stretch before you deathdrop. Keep being awesome.    Dor:    What I liked: I love you went outside of your comfort zone and showed us you can pretend to be sane. (:  The nuances in your face really sold the emotion for me and the sync is tight.    Where you missed the mark:  If you hadn’t told me the concept before I saw this vid I honestly would have no idea what’s going on. In film you need to serve the theme to the viewer on a silver platter with neon signs because it’s easy to miss. I know you had issues with filming this week but just a thought for the future.    Moving on: Like I said, beat the theme into our brains. Stay positive in this competition and in real life!"
LSFYL,2b9lz0,GeminiGaga,5,Mon Jul 21 07:44:53 2014 UTC,"I'm glad you liked it, despite not fully understanding. I view my lipsync this week as a message: I'm not just a drag queen, And I don't need these wigs or my typical drag makeup to be in this competition, so I wanted to throw those things out the window (Temporarily?) to show that i'm more than those things and I can look at the mold I cast myself into (The mold being: I have to do this in drag.) and break free from it and still be able to stand on my own without those things."
LSFYL,2b9lz0,theGstandsforGabriel,2,Mon Jul 21 15:52:33 2014 UTC,"I'm aware that this is my weakest sync technically-speaking. I had a single morning to pull it all together and it's clear that I didn't put in the lip work I have in the past (though I also think I might have just overlayed the entire thing a half-second off, too). I also wish I could have figured out the framing better so we don't cut off half my head in the start OR have empty space above my head.  Thanks for your critiques!"
LSFYL,2b9lz0,Zoomyx,1 point,Mon Jul 21 13:33:22 2014 UTC,"Thanks Babz :) I'm glad you liked the look and the intro :D  About losing energy, i agree with you. It's probably because when i rehearse i restart the song a lot but sometimes i don't wait till the end to restart it, so I have a lot of ideas for the begining but at the end it's weaker a little. I'm gonna work on that for the next video :D (my next song is also much less repetitive, so it'll help)"
LSFYL,2b9lz0,mrzfv,1 point,Wed Jul 23 01:55:05 2014 UTC,I really think you should still be in. It's a shame that your last video had the lighting and audio issues because I think that's what did you in. :(
LSFYL,2b9lz0,Babeford,2,Fri Jul 25 03:07:03 2014 UTC,"Thanks bb. I think what it was, was everyone thought I'd be safe so they didn't need to vote for me... So no one did haha."
LSFYL,2b9lz0,mtd1988,9,Fri Jul 25 03:38:21 2014 UTC,"Thoughts:  /u/theGstandsforGabriel - Splish, Splash...Another solid liquid entry from you. I like that you keep pushing yourself to do different things. Your growth as a performer has been great to watch!  /u/joanwaters – Speaking of liquids...Who dat? Who dat? J-O-A-N. Consistently versatile. This week, like Marie Antoinette, you gave good head!  Well done!  /u/GeminiGaga – Back in the swing of things! Your best yet. Impressed by your growth.  /u/Shutt_Up - My favorite of your videos. I loved your raw emotion. I absolutely ADORE that song, and you did it well!  /u/Zoomyx – Meowmyx! Your look was on point, your intro was hilarious, and your sync was (as usual) fantastic! Wonderful job!   /u/TheHarperValleyPTA – You have raised the bar. Best video so far.   /u/dOrPanthera - Nice to see you do something out of your comfort zone! I really enjoyed your video!

LSFYL,2b9lz0,KHRoxas,6,Wed Jul 23 01:38:13 2014 UTC,"My 7 brides. The competition is getting tougher and tighter as it goes on and this week is no exception. You have all performed wonderfully so far, however. I only have 6 roses.... This.. is the Bachleor.   As always, I will be critiquing you fine kettle of fish and if there is something I can do to help improve these crits. Please let me know. I am always looking for ways to improve so that they are helpful / useful to you all.    theGstandsforGabriel  Overall: Rubber Ducky, you're the one squeaksqueak you make bath time, lots of fun. I am still so confused in how I'm supposed to feel about this. Straight Boy teasing realness. I like how the ""duck earrings"" are looped around your ears. We all know how Sunday is reacting to this [Just look up / Watch American Dad - Season 1 Episode 9. A Smith in the Hand....]  The sync itself wasn't bad. You had good energy and fun prop usage. You were late when the song started. Your mouth shapes for the first ""homie"" was off. You were saying ""Lover"" twice. There were parts in the beginning where you just seemed off. You caught up but it was too late at that point. The concept was cute. Execution could have been a bit better. This will be a safe week for you.  Where I feel you can improve: Know your lyrics and the mouth shapes needed. You missed words in the first verse and sometimes during the ""fast"" bits your lips got lost. Which is odd because you killed last week. When you have songs with backing vocals and the main singer going at the same time. You have to choose what you are going to sync. If you try to do both, you must be on point. 2:17 ""Singing in the shower"" caused you to lose the beginning of the main bridge and that ""singing in the shower"" wasn't that strong either. The one right after it 2:26 or so, was better. You really shouldn't be trying to take that kind of gamble though. Practice. Practice, Practice.    joanwaters  Overall: You always bring use great characters. Living for you deary. Sync was on point. You were just a second late on ""Trash"" Aside from that cannot clock the lips. Good energy and just love the look. I wanna eat some cake.  Where I feel you can improve: Opening bit you were casually fanning yourself and then you decided to do it on beat. I feel it would be a been a bit better had it be on the beat to start instead of a work into it. You got your sync game down so no notes there. Just be mindful of starting words. When listening to it for the 2nd and 3rd time, I noticed that when you were doing the ""Who dat, who dat, I-G-G-Y"" with the gun. You didn't mute the video source. I could hear the gun plastic bits jiggling. It's not major but I noticed it and took a tiny bit a way. How do you edit your videos ? Do you record via laptop then do an overlay with the track ? It can help to play back your videos a few times to see if you can catch any sort of audio oddities.    geminigaga  Overall: I loved the use of the opening. THIS. THIS is the Gemini I fell in love with. You brought the energy, you brought a raw side of yourself out and you performed! I want to see more of this. You connected with the song and you truly looked like you enjoyed yourself. This is, hands down, one of your best videos this season. The road was long but you have nailed it. Now keep soaring Gem! Make the rest of these queens sweat!   Sync was wonderful, you had great energy and it was on point!  Where I feel you can improve: Keep this going. The energy, the personality and just a look of enjoyment. You have broken through that barrier. Keep adding energy, keep dancing and feeling that beat. I cannot express how proud I am of you, how proud all of us are of you. You saw it last night at the viewing party. We KNOW you got this. We KNOW what you are capable of. Now that YOU'VE seen it, I only hope you continue to bring that forth and show 'em you are a force to be reckoned with. Keep this confidence up.    Shutt_Up  Overall: You stole Gabe's lighting =P. That is one huge bed, I am jealous. I liked that you did a slower paced song. It's a refreshing change from the uptempo / fast-ish songs so far.  I like the shot you used / set up around 1:58 or so. Your sync was good and you felt the song. However, I felt that you were emoting too much. Some of it was a bit over the top and it wasn't really needed. You had good bits, but I feel that some of it could have been a bit more inline with the rest.  Where I feel you can improve: Shot in the afternoon / midday. You're gonna run into some light issues. I won't stick to this as I'm sure you know it already. If you're doing something where it'll have a harsh light or a light as bright as well, the sun. You'd benefit from put some sort of color on your lips to help make them stand out.   Like I mentioned, sync was good. Just be careful when you're getting into the song and starting to add emotion on top of it. Some parts were a bit over exaggerated and it took away from the feel. You might benefit from watching the sync back a couple times or maybe even have another person watch your sync. This way they can pick up things you may have missed if you've watched it 10+ times. Good job though Shutt.    zoomyx  Overall: Why is Joan a Furby? o_o. Also called it.   Some of the mouth shapes could have been stronger and you missed a couple words. ""Alive"" ""Pour"" Your movements looked a bit stale after the second verse as well. It can be bound to happen with songs as repetitious as this. Try to find ways to move that still make sense to  the song but will still keep the viewer engaged. Ueh would be a good person to ask for help from on that.   Sync was good and you had nice energy. Sync itself could have been tighter.  Where I feel you can improve: The sound at the end of your skit. While it's cute and plays into it, maybe turn it down a lil bit.  Be mindful of your mouth shapes and the words coming up. You missed the word ""Red"" but caught and detox'd ""black"". The dip you did immediately after caused you to lose ""and"". I think you missed ""Alive"" or at least the opening shape for it. The line ""Sweat is pouring"" got lost. You hit ""is"" but your shapes for ""sweat"" and ""sweating"" weren't there. You hit the rest though. When your doing things with your mouth [phrasing] when it's a short break you need to be aware of when the next word comes in. The example would be 3:01 to 3:02 before ""What"" starts. That shape causes you to lose the ""hwh"" in ""what has become"". When a song has backing and lead vocals, you need to make a decision on what part you want to do for each section. If you want to keep it dedicated to one throughout or to change it up every other chorus.    TheHarperValleyPTA  Overall: I love how this turned out. I know you were so worried. I'm expecting your stuff to look like this next season Sunday! <3.   You lose some energy because you're sitting down, however it doesn't take -too- much away from the overall sync. Sync was good but there were a few spots that kind of tripped ya up. I do like how you used past looks of the contestants and yourself. I enjoyed it and I can't wait to see what you bring to the table next week. Keep it up!   Where I feel you can improve: Just mouth shapes really. and potentially editting. The ""Now there's an issue that has come to my attention that we to discuss right now"" The head turn causes you to lose ""attention that"" but you got the rest of it. I don't know if it was an edit you did or if it is the song itself, but ""My makeup is terrible"" seemed sudden. You were also late on it too and I think it carried into the next one as well. I don't know if you had a cup of water or a mirror nearby but around 0:40 you have this light circle under your chin and it dances around for quite a while. Tiny bit distracting but nothing that takes away from the sync. Good job this week!     dOrPanthera  Overall: I'm glad that you also decided to go with a more downbeat song. It made it feel a bit more personal, like we're seeing you and not crazy eyes. It helps make you stand out this week. Sync was good and you felt the song. I don't know if I have any other notes. You did a good job this week. Now don't be sad ;-;  Where I feel you can improve: You know about the conversation =P. and you were late coming in for the background vocals that come in at 3:37. You open your mouth at 3:38 and it makes it look a little silly.    My 7 brothers, this was a tight week and I'm proud of all of you. Now I cannot wait to see all you cover UEH for next week. Great job all! Keep on serving it."
LSFYL,2b9lz0,joanwaters,3,Mon Jul 21 19:31:14 2014 UTC,"Thanks Roxas! I can always count on you clocking the smallest things and it keeps me on my toes like some fierce heels!

LSFYL,2b9lz0,theGstandsforGabriel,2,Mon Jul 21 20:18:34 2014 UTC,"Actually I'm pretty sure I'm saying ""Lomie"" instead of ""Lover"" but the miss is still there. And those earrings are actually made by linking staples together and duck taping to the back of my ears for a waterproof seal."

LSFYL,2b9lz0,TheHarperValleyPTA,2,Mon Jul 21 21:52:16 2014 UTC,"yep, I had the compact that I used in the ending of the song on my knee. I didn't realize that it was reflecting the light until editing and at that point I just had to roll with it. the spoken word component definitely tripped me up a couple times, ""and issue that has come to my attention"" was a big one because I kept wanting to say ""has been brought to my attention"" because that's how she says it the second time. I didn't edit the song in anyway, though, the chorus just kinda comes out of nowhere. As usual, thanks for your critiques. I know you put a lot of thought and effort into them and I really appreciate it!!"
LSFYL,2b9lz0,GeminiGaga,2,Tue Jul 22 00:47:17 2014 UTC,"This compliment means so much to me! I am so happy the passion I put into this week's video (the song, the non-drag, everything) is validated by you & so many of the viewers and fellow competitors. Thank you so much! I am so happy honestly because when I look back at my first and second video and then I watch this, I am just overjoyed with how much i've learned (and am still learning) and how far i've come so far! <3"

LSFYL,2b9lz0,AgentFear,6,Wed Jul 23 02:05:06 2014 UTC,"The Spectacular 7. Competition is tight and it's very noticeable. Everyone is stepping up their game and I'm glad to see it. Great week, everyone! I'm going to keep the critiques quick this week.   Now on to the observations:   theGstandsforGabriel: The concept of your video is fun! This is definitely breaking from the norm of your previous videos. I laughed at the drop of the soap, it was a funny moment. I don't think you've done anything bad with this video, but with this tight competition, there are others that I believe performed a little better. Maybe this was too hokey as opposed to 'fierce'? JoanWaters: I love how your looks are so versatile now. You're really growing as a drag performer. Tight sync and solid performance! Always impressive, Ms. Joan Waters.  GeminiGaga: This has got to be your best video, hands down. You performed so well this week and you did what I believe everyone was clamoring from you: to bring it, connect to the song and really perform with a great energy. You hit all those targets with this video. I think this is an example of perfect song choice and how vital that is. Congratulations for working that out.  Shutt_Up: This was a solid submission. I appreciate that you went downtempo this week. I love the way you emoted. Great job this week! Critique: The lighting! Just watch out for that next time! Zoomyx: Your introduction was fantastic. Your makeup was incredible, too, and clearly worked with your song choice. This has been a huge improvement over last week, where you seemed to get lost. This week, you were focused and it shows. You should feel very proud because you are definitely safe! TheHarperValleyPTA: You won this week. 'nuff said.  dOrpanthera: I really like that you did something totally different this week. You and Shutt_Up were wise to choose something downtempo, because both of your videos stood out to me. I'm not sure what was going on during the instrumental break down but your lip sync was good and it came across convincingly! I really like your facial expressions during your performances."

Water off a duck's back, right? ;)  joanwaters AMAZING CONCEPT I am gagged beyond words! Giving good head face as always. Slaying these hoes FOR REAL THO.   Gemini DAT VULNERABILITY. You're bringing so much energy this time, which has been one of the main critiques you've been getting here for the last few weeks. I like it -- but I was also a big fan the aloof cold ass bitch vibes of your previous lip syncs.   Shutt_Up Another ~vulnerable performance! I'm not a massive fan of this song, but the emotion you brought to the sync captures its essence perfectly.   zoomyx I like your concept and the sync itself was great! FIERCE!  HarperValley Alaska is my favourite queen of all time, I love your Alaska eye makeup and props to ya mama for the NAILS! The shade was everything. My favourite of the week! I just wish you kinda smudged your makeup around at the end.   dOr I looove Sky Ferreira so a big toot for the song choice! In fact - I always like your song choices. I'm just not sure if I understand your concept this week. The sync itself was great, however.  And Chris, I LOVE your hair this week!"

LSFYL,2b9lz0,dOrPanthera,6,Wed Jul 23 01:38:51 2014 UTC,"I only tuned in last week so these thoughts will lack context, but here are my thoughts nonetheless:  theGstandsforGabriel: I love it!! Last week you were spot on with the super difficult lip-sync but I thought it lacked personality/variety.. but you totally brought it this week! I'm going to make a prediction... I think you'll win this week!  joanwaters: I thought you matched the energy of the song really well, and I love the look! I personally can't stand that song but I tried to not let that influence my opinions.. haha. Your expressions are always hilarious though and you really know how to entertain. Another great week!  geminigaga: Great job, I like your concept a lot. Lip-sync was also on-point! A couple parts felt a little repetitive, but that may have just been the song. Other than that I think it was much better than last week! Love the emotion in this one.  Shutt_Up: I liked it! but this feels like such an emotional song/concept that I wish the camera was more of a close-up. So much of your acting was just in the face but it felt so far away and I feel like it could have packed a little more punch a little closer up. Hope that makes sense.  zoomyx: I thought you matched the tone of the song sooo well in your acting. Spot-on. You really get that frustrated, sort-a-angry feel. I enjoyed this one so much more than last week's! Great job!  TheHarperValleyPTA: Don't have much to say about this one, but I thought it was funny! I liked your concept and your expressions were pretty great. Also liked this one much better than last week (there's a theme here).  dOrPanthere: OK you won me over with this one. I'm trying to check myself here because I think you're super cute and I'm trying not to let that influence my judging (>_> heh...) but I thought your acting was coming from a genuine place so I felt some good communication in your video. If I had to guess, I'd say you had someone in mind when you were singing that and you really meant it.. or.. you're just a good actor. haha. I liked your vid last week but this one I like better because it feels more genuine to me. Great job :)  Everyone did so great this week, I tuned in at a good time!"

LSFYL,2b9lz0,TheHarperValleyPTA,5,Mon Jul 21 06:00:14 2014 UTC,"I guess I'll do critiques too! As an aside, I loved every single video this week, just like last week. You guys are getting better and better, by the end of this you'll all combine into a single lipsyncing entity.   TheGstandsforGabriel: The concept/song choice match up was good and you managed to execute it without seeming awkward. Filming like that is not easy, and to do it in as few takes as you had is pretty impressive. That said, I'll echo the sentiments of others and note that you did not have all the words down this week. The biggest problem is the repetition in the song, and the fact that you didn't have much to change it up. You used props and removing the showercap to keep it fresh, but just be careful with these repetitive songs. My tip for next week: pick a song that you know you can deliver, and don't worry about shade/picking a memorable contestant.   joanwaters: Another fantastic song choice and concept/outfit pairing this week. Doing Marie Antoinette for Fancy is a ridiculously good idea, I guess it shouldn't be a surprise you were the one to do it. While this was still a great lipsync, it feels similar to last week. More subdued, but a lot of the expressions and movements are similar. We've seen so many versions of Joan that I was super confident you'd make this its own performance, and I was slightly let down. My tip for next week: I want to see another flavor of Joan! We've seen crazy, sexy, campy, bad bitch, and I love all of them. Pick a contestant whose style you can use while still retaining the Joan we love.   GeminiGaga: Perfect. I can't state how happy I am, not so much that you doffed the makeup and hair, but that you showed us another kind of Gem. Every week you're becoming a bigger and stronger force in this competition, and this week you were easily one of the biggest standouts. Not easy to do with this crowd of talented performers. My biggest critique is the same as last week: you keep looking away from the camera! You get that connection for a few seconds, then you look down and to the side a little and it's lost. Then you reconnect, and again it's gone. Once you get that down, you'll really break free and become one of the frontrunners. My tip for next week: Pick a song that someone did that you can form an emotional connection to, and don't worry TOO much about being like them/throwing shade at them. Obviously you want to fit the theme, but make that the secondary goal.   Shutt_Up: thas a huge ass bed  A slow pace song is always a risk but I feel like the emotional connection was there. Zooming in and out is distracting, keep that to a minimal. Combined with the lighting (which you need to give back to Gabe), it made your lips harder to see. Which is a shame, since you clearly knew the words and could deliver them well. Overall, I did really like this video based on your performance, but the technical problems made it harder to appreciate. My tip for next week is exactly that, fix those issues and keep giving us these emotional/slow songs because between this and Janis, it's what you're good at.   zoomyx: I thought Shutt's video last week had the best intro, but you've taken that. Onto the sync itself: costume is on POINT (though the ears seem out of place), and as usual with this week it fit the song in a good way. My issue is with the fact that, like a lot of songs this week, the lyrics were repetitive so you eventually ran out of things to do. Your attitude though, was super good. You had the life in your eyes and you really seemed to be enjoying yourself, which helps us enjoy it too. My tip for you, next week, is to go all the way. Unlike my tip for everyone else so far, I do want to see you use your trademark wit and props to capture/throw shade at a contestant. It's something you're good at, and this week plays to your strengths a lot.   TheHarperValleyPTA: Oh hey, another video that takes my previous 'top spot'. This time, your video replaces Joan's from last week as my favorite of the competition so far. I really don't have a lot to say. My only critique, the sitting down and thus loss of energy that results, was unavoidable due to your injury. Some of the words weren't there all the way, though. Keep an eye on that. But there was so much about this that I loved. Shade at contestants, shade at yourself, an unexpected-but-totally-obvious song choice, the makeup...You had a few issues with the green screen (mostly around your neck), but even that was executed very well for what I assume to be your first attempt at using one. My tip for next week is to just keep it up. You're on a roll, keep exploring the technical side of making these videos and find new ways to enhance yourself.   d0rPanthera: I love this song, and you really delivered the emotions and had a good amount of facial diversity, especially considering the song doesn't change emotion/tone much. Oddly enough, I feel like sitting down didn't sap your energy much. I think it's because you knew what you wanted to deliver, and the sitting helped it more than it hindered it. My issue with this is the song/concept disconnect. I SORT of get it, but that's after watching it a few times. If you make the concept clearer, people get that instant ""YES"" that they get from watching videos like Joan's and Harper's this week. Yours was more of a slow ""Okay, now I get it! This is cool!"", and that isn't as effective. Overall, I'm impressed that you went for something slower and saner and I feel like it paid off. My tip for next week: get your concept clear in your head, and use your inherent creativity to make it clear. If you can get that first-second ""YES"", you're already on your way to earning someone's top vote."
LSFYL,2b9lz0,joanwaters,3,Mon Jul 21 20:49:44 2014 UTC,"Thanks for liking this video! I did try to work more about eye contact in this one. And rewatching the video, I see moments where I shouldn't have looked away, but I can't stare into the camera the entire time so I think thats why I look away. I'll keep working at it. As for next week- I don't plan to do anything shady. I'm not here to be shady at anyone in Season 2 or Season 1. Whatever I end up doing for this next video will be from a place of love and passion for the song, not from a place of mockery or shade. Trust!"

You were giving looks, tight lipsyncs and great concepts before but you were lacking energy. It seemed like something held you back. You have overcome that. You dazzled, you broke that barrier and brought the house down THE HOUSE DOWN.org.co.uk.com. I loved the more simple look and make-up and damn you're so cute and adorable and pretty. Gurl, really, if I wasn't stuck in Cologne I would probably try to date you. Sounds crazy but take it as a compliment.   joanwaters You have so much C.U.N.T., I'll give you one year and you're ready for Drag Race. Don't have to say a lot, you're just flawless.

COME ON LIBERTÉ COME EGALITÉ COME ON FRATERNITÉ  gemini - ugh your best yet! like a phoenix from the ashes, kudos! watch the autofocus on your camera.   shutt up - im going to come to wherever you are and pinch your butt. COME ON WHITE BALANCE  zoom -  that intro was not the business. otherwise just fine. but is that going to win the competition?  harper - YES GAWD. its tough doing a whole sync sitting down, we lost some energy there.  dor - loving the stripped down you. again, sitting down can be death as far as energy goes.  toots to this whole bunch."
LSFYL,2b9lz0,eggsgrainey,3,Wed Jul 23 03:39:28 2014 UTC,"Sorry- Autofocus is the only focus my camera has for some ungodly reason. So either I keep my face perfectly visible and barely move it so it autofocuses to my face, or I just roll with it. I also don't know until I put the files onto my computer how much it got blurry so, I just roll with what I got & maybe some day I can afford a better camera. That aside, glad you enjoyed this video! <3"

LSFYL,2b9lz0,MikiClash,3,Wed Jul 23 22:09:41 2014 UTC,"TheHarperValleyPTA - I really hope Alaska sees this. I was so bored with you last week after you being my strong favorite throughout the competition, and you brought yourself right back to my top slot.  zoomyx - This was definitely the weakest you've done so far to me, but I think part of that is just because I really don't like the song. I have faith you've got more great ones in you though, and this one still had enough great moments for you to make my top 3.  Shutt_up - I had never really gotten into your videos, but this one was just great. I can tell you really feel the song, and the fact that your lighting was a mess, camerawork was a little shaky in parts, etc. didn't take away from the fact that I felt something watching this. Great job.    Gabriel - those earrings are fucking hysterical  Overall opinion...I should not have watched HarperValleyPTA first. You were miles above everybody else this week and it deserves to be recognized.   Edit: I feel like I need to point out in fairness to dOrPanthera and joanwaters that I feel like I'm judging both of you very harshly, albeit unintentionally. dOr, I think you're cute and I do a lot of back and forth about whether I like the video or just like looking at you. Joan, I've said it many times, but I just think you have so much talent, and I KNOW IT'S THERE after last week. I got frustrated watching you this week because I wanted you to hit a 10 again, and it was just ""good"" for me. Good luck to both of you. :)"

LSFYL,2ap8rj,Babeford,5,Tue Jul 15 05:50:39 2014 UTC,"I think this would be a great place to collect art (like a fanart masterpost?), but I feel like new art posts should warrant their own individual links. The LSFYL rounds have a deadline so videos will go up around a certain day, but people take different amounts of time to finish a drawing. And also I like seeing pretty pictures as thumbnails. Just my two cents."
LSFYL,2ap8rj,thelettergii,3,Tue Jul 15 20:13:19 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I think it's a great place to deposit links, and maybe put it on the sidebar? So whenever you're bored you can comb through people's previous art."
LSFYL,2ap8rj,ThePrincessEva,2,Tue Jul 15 21:42:49 2014 UTC,"Yeah! Or even better, you can add flair to posts (like artwork, announcements) and then we can search through all the subreddit posts by their flair."

LSFYL,2ap8rj,ThePrincessEva,3,Wed Jul 16 00:19:17 2014 UTC,"I think a superthread to collect links is a good idea, like /u/thelettergii and I discussed, as long as people can still post their portraits and stuff separately as well."
LSFYL,2ap8rj,thelettergii,4,Wed Jul 16 00:41:57 2014 UTC,"Sure, that works for me: individual threads so people can still get link karma, and then a repost here so that people looking for a consolidated art wall can find everything. That sound like a good plan, everybody?"

LSFYL,2an06l,ForestfortheDraois,5,Wed Jul 16 05:38:04 2014 UTC,"Oh hi! I'm gonna post some critiques now!   joanwaters: There's not much to say. Energy, sync, look,  movements, literally everything is there. I can't think of a single flaw in this, which makes it hard to post a serious critique. So my big point here is: KEEP THIS UP. This was, to me, bar none the best video of the week by a wide margin. You had such a clear concept, and you matched the song's energy and words to a tee. Good job this week. My one, singular critique is that the pig nose doesn't seem completely blended in. It's noticeable from the side.   TheHarperValleyPTA: The filter and effects, especially the shattering at the end, were great. Your mouth knew every word, your facial expressions were on point, and though you mostly stayed in the same spot, your body language was strong. This is another video that I don't have many real critiques for, aside from wanting more movement. This was one of my top videos of the week as well. My advice: your face fit the song, but try to change it up more. Think of other emotions that can fit the song but be different from what you're emoting most of the time.   TheGstandsforGangsta: I do believe this was the fastest song of the bunch, if I'm not mistaken. In that sense, you were the most ambitious and you certainly matched the challenge. I had the same problem as in Harper's video: not much diversity in terms of facial expressions. Stoicism seems very common this week, which makes sense, but does detract a bit from the overall rewatchability. That said, you earn major props for picking such a fast song and delivering the words so well. Yet another video that ranks way high up.   Babeford: Compared to Harper and Gabe, you had much more movement and facial diversity, which is fantastic. Your rap speed was slower than theirs though, which makes the overall performance less impressive than it could be. That said, matching the lyrics with that particular costume is really clever, and you looked pretty damn cool with your swaying. Again, a really great video that I have trouble giving a solid critique. My advice is, if you see your competitors being more ambitious, then see if you can match that level of difficulty while still giving your trademark quality lipsyncs. I think you can do it.   GeminiGaga: This, to me, was the worst video of the week. But it was still really good and a huge step up from last week. Your energy was strong, your look was gagworthy, and you hit every word. In a week where everyone brought it, you just brought it slightly less. I'm hoping for a non-elimination week because everyone did so well, you included. My problem with this video was your eye contact. You never quite looked at the camera, always just slightly off. If your eye contact had been there, this video would've been much higher on my list. It made the performance feel less powerful. So work on that, mama!   Zoomyx and Zoomette: Iggy Azalea and Jack Black duet? It's more likely than you think. Your words were on point, but your energy was not Eminem level. You seemed to be holding back on the male side, whereas the female side matched the energy levels of their part of the song. Splitscreen is always an innovative idea, and instead of detracting from the performance, here it allowed you to do both parts of the song in a way that made sense. My advice for you is to, again, match the energy levels of what you're doing. Otherwise, it makes the sync more obvious.   dOrPanthera: The glorious return of Syphilis Jones. This was another video that was just fantastic. Your face is insane, and your body language finally came through in a big way for me. Your shoulders in the opening and everything after that are exactly what I asked for last week. I'm very slightly disappointed that you went for another 'crazy' performance after last week, but the results were so strong that I'm willing to overlook it completely. Your whole performance fit the song so well, I'm very impressed.   Shutt_Up: The best opening for a video in the competition so far. Your look and mom dance moves were fantastic. Compared to everyone else, who went for a look that matched what you'd think of for a rap, you went the opposite direction and it was just as interesting. Your energy is always so strong, and your sync is completely on point. This was perfect, every element worked in your favor.   As you can see, I liked every video this week. I really hope for a non-elim cause these hoes earned it!   EDIT: Just fixed a few problems with the critiques."
LSFYL,2an06l,ThePrincessEva,3,Mon Jul 14 05:02:25 2014 UTC,"I agree with you, my male part lacked energy :/ I tried so hard to learn an english song (at first i was gonna do a french one, but i was afraid that people wouldn't like it) but in the end, even if i knew the words, i really had a lot of problem syncing fast enough to follow the lyrics and ended up focusing so much on that that i forgot to actually give energy. This week is clearly a misstep for me, and it's unfortunate that it happened when literally everyone else is killing it. I'm only hoping I can stay around one more week to show what I can really do :)"
LSFYL,2an06l,Zoomyx,3,Mon Jul 14 07:02:53 2014 UTC,"ah, movement is definitely my killer. physical expression is definitely something I struggle with a lot (because my face by default is resting bitchy face), and it's something that I'm working on. I'm glad you liked the sync <3"
LSFYL,2an06l,TheHarperValleyPTA,2,Mon Jul 14 08:49:10 2014 UTC,"Thank you!  Your critiques are always so good.  Glad you enjoyed the return. I can see how it can read as crazy, but I felt I gave more of a ratchet vibe, less insane faces (which were appropriate for last weeks song) more gangsta hood rat (which is very much the energy of this song). But I gotch chew. Regardless, thanks again and you rock!"

LSFYL,2an06l,Babeford,2,Mon Jul 14 06:59:57 2014 UTC,I'm still kicking myself for not getting in as many takes as I normally do (babysitting all week). Took me till Saturday just to get the sync itself down. But I totally agree with your assessment.
LSFYL,2an06l,theGstandsforGabriel,7,Mon Jul 14 07:36:07 2014 UTC,"The Eerie 8. I must say, this week's theme is the one I've been looking forward to the most. The focus on technical lip syncing efficiency,  coupled with swagger and flat-out just being entertaining are the basis for my criteria this week. Thankfully, this is the best week of  competition. The videos have been phenomenal. Also, what is it about hip hop/rap that makes you all want to throw shade against each other?   Now on to the observations:   JoanWaters: My first reaction was: Why the pig look? Then I heard the lyrics: perfect. The lip sync was really tight, and that's to  be expected from you. I love that you chose a song that exemplified swagger and you delivered it. I enjoyed your different facial  expressions and how much you actually commit to the performance. The more I watched your video, I was reminded me less of a pig and more of a character from that Twilight Zone episode called The Eye Of The Beholder. That made me love this even more. There's nothing I can critique about your video because it was the right pitch of nearly everything.  TheHarperValleyPTA: Technically speaking, this video was superb. The lip sync was great, the song choice was solid and it was wise to use the red filter over your video because it made it really stand out. That filter caused me to focus more on your mouth and it was easy to see that you did not mess up once. The attitude in here was on point. Your video reminded me of Joan's in terms of quality and concept: You both looked like your song's topic, you brought high energy and swagger and you both killed it. You're both very neck and neck this week for me. Unfortunately, I can't give you a critique this week because it would be forced and disingenuous. Continue to do what you do.  TheGstandsforGabriel: This was the most difficult song out of the whole group and I did not see a single flaw in its execution.  Choosing a song that's over 5 minutes was really risky, especially considering how difficult the song actually is, but it was handled  deftly. This video was something I've been wanting to see come out of you during this competition. I will say, for a critique, you brought  enough swagger to the video but I would not have minded seeing just bit more. More what? Maybe some head bopping, a little more expression in your face, some hand movements, some more personality. I understand that's not what you were going for, since you were showing off your lip syncing prowess this week, but next week is contemporary music. Perhaps you can apply it then; just fall into that character completely.  Babeford: Your look was perfectly ridiculous. The idiosyncrasies of your video were great. Wearing the sunglasses during the the Ray Charles line, for example, or the simulation of oral sex during the 'gargled' line. I'm tired of saying this already but your sync was also tight. As a suggestion for next week, you should bring it back to your basics. By that, I mean bring the emotion through your dancing. Your dancing is a huge strength for your performances and you wisely have not relied on it during the whole competition. Bring it back, tho. Remind these bitches that you have more tricks up your sleeves.  GeminiGaga: You look so damn good this week! You've stepped it up tremendously from last week, which is exactly what you have to do. This is my honest critique, tho: I didn't feel the song had the same kind of difficulty that so many other songs here had. If you chose a faster song, especially when compared to the choices by your fellow contestants, you'd have a much better standing this week for me. I am still rooting for you but I wish your song choice was just a little stronger! Zoomyx: This video was edited very well. I love the dichotomy of the two different screens. Your looks for both characters was on point and I love that you added the female aspect of the song. The thing is, I think she may have out-shined your male counterpart, which is a problem. I understand that English is not your native language so I would have liked you to lip sync something in French! This was not the easiest song but it certainly was not the hardest. I've noticed in most of your videos, the songs you've chosen are more on the easy side, but that makes sense. English is not your native language. Since that is the case, you could have chosen a fast French rap song! This was the week to really showcase how you work those words.  dOrpanthera: I loved the drama from the second it started. You didn't turn around, causing a build up for the video, and I was waiting to see what you'd bring. Your make up was distinct and your lip sync was very solid. I love the energy you give off in your videos because it's always different, but never lacking. My only critique for you this week would be this: the song choice maybe wasn't the best for this week. Azealia Banks raps fast and those parts were phenomenal, but the male voice and the silent parts took a good chunk of time out of the video. It felt like it was nearly half of the video! Your performance, however, definitely outshines that to me.  Shutt_Up: This was all about the presentation to me and it was top notch. The little skit in the beginning, the apparent fun that you delivered while performing the actual lip sync and just the funny approach to the whole thing made this one a great video. These are all your strengths. You knew what you wanted to deliver and you did it. For a critique, I would say not to lose that kind of fun aspect to your videos. You've been progressing in this competition with your talent, creativity and charm, so don't lose focus of that. Trust your instincts."

LSFYL,2an06l,Babeford,1 point,Mon Jul 14 06:58:16 2014 UTC,"First of all, thank you for your critique :)  I really thought about doing a french song, but i was very afraid that people would not relate to it because they wouldn't understand the lyrics, especially since nearly every rap that i know in french focus entirely on lyrics and have a very basic rhythm. It was a big dilemma that I had, because personally, I have trouble seeing if people sync well to a song in another language because I don't know how they enunciate the words, so I was afraid that even if I had a perfect sync, nobody would actually realise it. (TLDR: i was too scared to do a french song).  With that said, I agree with you about my lack of energy in the male part: I knew every word of that rap, but i had a lot of trouble following it during the fast parts, and all my attention was on trying to catch up with the lyrics. I think that if I knew what I know now, I would have tried a french song because I am disappointed in the energy I gave during this sync. I hope I can survive another week though because I'd be sad if this video was my last in the comp!!"
LSFYL,2an06l,Zoomyx,1 point,Mon Jul 14 07:27:15 2014 UTC,"Well, I really wanted to give you more swagger but my week sort of got away from me and I wasn't able to get the sync down to the point where I could focus on doing much else. But it's the same note I gave myself, so good to know there's always something to work on!"

LSFYL,2an06l,TheHarperValleyPTA,8,Mon Jul 14 08:47:06 2014 UTC,"This week was FUCKING FIERCE!!  Joan : You fucking win. Literally. No use denying it. Crown it already. This video was perfect in every way and i have nothing i would have changed!! Your brow coverage was flawless. All your movements were PERFECTLY acted out and had the EXACT emotion they were intended for. For some reason, this reminded me of Pousse from OITNB? Good job mumma. Live. For. You.  Harper Lookin' hot as usual!! However, being put in the list after Joan was really unfortunate, it's almost like going after Bianca in a comedy challenge... Regardless, i think you were middle of the pack this week. Nothing to do with your sync, cause it was flawless, but it just kind of lacked excitement for me... And i'm probably only saying that cause all of your other vids were so fucking fab! So i know you have it in you!  TheG Spot on sync. VERY impressed you knew ALL THE FUCKING WORDS!! Youget points for the fastest rap this week. However, the video lacked excitement for me... I know the focus is on the lips, but you didn't even show any emotion to the words. It felt like you could have been reciting a death note, or reading a nursery rhyme and your face wouldn't have changed. Same note from last week, connect with the song like you did from the Sister Act week!  Babeford Literally laughed out loud when you popped your pickle head into frame. However, that was the climax for the video for me. I don't want you coasting through the comp on 'good'. I want to see more amazing syncs like skinny love and chandelier! And it's not only because they were slow songs, its because you had the energy and the connection with the lyrics! You need to understand the story you're trying to tell, and let your emotions portre them! And i know you can do that, cause i've seen it from you many times before!  Gemini You. Look. Fierce. You always do, and i'm kind of jealous... Your sync was good, but i think you need more energy for something like fast rap week. We're kind of getting the same emotions and actions we get from you every week, even though the songs are telling vastly different stories. There are some really tough competitors left in this comp, and i think you need to bring your videos to the next level.  Zoomyx This video was so well thought out! Even with the colour schemes and the reacting to the other character in the frame! You sync was great, and i think the girl character was played spot on, however i would have liked to have seen more with the Eminem sync. In saying that, Definitely one of the better videos this week though.  Dopr So fucking glad this guy is back!! However loved the last video he did better, but only cause it was so amazing, nothing could top it; not because this was bad. Cause it wasn't. It was fucking great. Every week your videos are great, but i may think you're resting on 'safe'. You need to step it up so be winner each week which i know you're capable of! Try adding another element to the video. I think you could take this whole thing if you go to the next level.  Shutup Laughed. Out. So. Fucking. Loud! SOOOOO FUNNY!!! Your strong points are your acting and your comedy, so i think you should try and incorporate that into each video! Without the beginning bit, this video would have been average, but since you showed us who the character was, it literally made it hilarious. Especially the finger wave dance. It happens to be a personal favorite for me. In the ending however, i think you should have cut the music abruptly and shown the kid standing there horrified watching his mum. Defs one of the top this week.  -ShuShu"

Spent it looking after a pair of little girls and I didn't have as much time as I wanted to be able to do different takes and I had trouble giving attitude and keeping the sync tight."

You guys all brought it and I am very honored to be part of a competition with people as amazing as you :)  Joan - You keep bringing it every week. You are my pick for a winner, and I seriously think you'll go far in the drag scene. You're hilarious, look amazing and are genuinely nice. Keep doing you and the world will be at your feet <3  Harper - You're so beautiful. Every week you come with a different look, a different character and a different story. You're more than a good lip syncer, you're literally an artist and I want to see what kind of video you come up with every week.  Gabriel - Those lips were made for syncing. While I use props in nearly every video to keep people's attention, you don't have to do that: watching that mouth move is all we need to be entertained. Syncing to a song that fast took balls of steel, and I'm glad you took that risk because it paid off.  Babz - My canadian partner <3 No matter what you wear or how you look, or if you're a lady or a man, you still look amazing. Not only are you a great dancer, but your video are always so different and original. Also, keep that between you and me but you're probably the best looking pickle I've seen in my life.  Gemini - To me, you will always be young and beautiful. Your face is painted for the gods and you always look completely flawless. This week your look was my favorite (and it is nearly every week) and I would LOVE to see what you could do with a little bit more budget. Also, you impressed me this week: your lip sync is extremely tight!  Dor - Ooooooh Dor :) You know how much I love you. No matter if you wear a reversed shirt in an asylum or extremely big highbrows, I'll always think you're the cutest guy ever. Your facial expression are my favorites and I love how you create a character for every sync. I'm really happy to have met you in this comp <3  Shutt_Upp - My little black horse. You really keep getting better every week!! I first saw you as a middle contestant, but now I could literally see you in the top 3. Your ideas are always so great and original, I never know what to expect from you. One week you're in the water, the other inside red balloons, and after that you became a gorgeous janis joplin and an excentric mother. I'm very impressed by how much you grew in this competition, Shutt :)  Aight, I guess I become overly nice when I can't sleep lol. Anyway, good job everyone, I think that no matter what happen thursday, you can all be extremely proud of yourself :)"

LSFYL,2an06l,GeminiGaga,5,Mon Jul 14 08:46:12 2014 UTC,"Joan- you killed me with this one gurl. The manic facial expressions, the paint/nose, the Cynthia hair... gotta give it up for you   Harper - This is one of my fave rap songs of all time and I think you should have left it the original speed, which would have allowed more intensity in the lipsync performance -- it felt rushed, in a way that hindered the performance  Gabriel - I think you focused on the speed rap being fast and precise -- which a lot of people pay attention to closely -- and let everything else slip to the side. I would have liked more drama to the sync, props, set dressing...  Babeford - I want a pickle. Your performance was pretty on point for me. You did good.  GG- Yessssss slay mama okcurrrr (but seriously, great great lipsync. That song is my guilty pleasure and u did it proud.  zoom - I liked the split screen, and how you had the female vocalist engaged the whole time the rapper was on with the background vocals. Thumbs up from me.  dOrP - I was hoping someone would do this song but the version you chose wasn't the best -- the vocals were barely audible over the beat :[ The performance, however, was good, and as I find with you every week, you had me engaged for the whole thing.  Shutt_up- I really liked the concept for your sync, but I thought that in parts it seemed a little off enunciation-wise   Disclaimer: you are all-stars. responsitr**ty.mp3"

LSFYL,2an06l,viqule,5,Mon Jul 14 07:31:42 2014 UTC,"Goddammit, people. This was supposed to be the week where you all got tripped up. Sheesh.  Joan Waters: Absolutely terrifying. You were a disgusting psychopathic pig monster and I loved every second of it. It's hard to pin down what works so well for you here, since I can't say I got ""speed rap"" from it. You rap, yes, but the whole thing seems to really hit its stride when you start doing Nicki's spoken word beat. Which is great, but only because you nailed every little moment. Otherwise I'd be reading you for resting on easy spoken word stuff over fast rap instead of placing you in my top for this week. This is exactly how you tailor a challenge to your own personal brand.  TheHarperValleyPta: You always deliver great and original looks and while I'm upset we only saw one out of the three I think the choice was the right once production-wise. You're giving us a strong performance here and, while I wasn't the biggest fan of the filter (don't think you needed it having seen the look normally) and I might have wanted a little more of a character matching the rapper's energy (minor, who cares really), this is pretty what what I've come to expect from you.  Babeford: In another week this would have been right up at the top, but with such a strong showing I gotta look closer. The song you chose wasn't the hardest for a rap. Lot's of repeated lines and it wasn't super fast, which means that you're going to lose a few points for difficulty level (on the one week where that seems to count for anything), but it also meant that while you were giving us character and swagger it reminded me a little of Bob Ford in dead people week. A sort of white-boy dancing that didn't have the control or expression of your usual dancing. Which also could have been the pickle. Which, while I love a good costume, I don't get. Even with the pickles at the end. I don't see the connection and if you're going to ask us to accept an out-of-the-box look we have to be able to get that connection in the first two seconds of the sync. If not, it reads as a disconnect and could even be distracting.  GeminiGaga: I, like everybody else, loved the new look and the fact that you seemed to be tailoring it to the task at hand (rapper realness). It shows that you're growing and that's great. But at the same time you did seem like you were more interested in giving us your idea of who Gemini is rather than giving us the best rap lip-sync you could. You picked a slower/easier song and while you hit the notes there's this feeling I get when watching you like you're unwilling to just go all out with it, flail your arms, make yourself a mess. I want to know that you as an artist can make this beautiful look and then you (the performer) can outshine even that and leave it all on the floor. It's not just about being 'safe' for the comp, but about being 'safe' as an artist, which is not something you wanna be. Next week give us messy and dangerous and crazy fierce. Cuz we all know you can do glam like no other already.  Zoomyx: Split screens are cute, and it certainly helped to give us something to look at during the 'down' parts of the video (when we weren't rapping). Which in another week might have been enough. But since apparently everybody brought their A game this time around, I started to get a little bored watching the female vocals (they're great but they are repetitive) and wanting to see more from the rapper side than just sort of looking around lost. Rapper you, who should have been the focal point, was the one who kept bowing out to the backup vocalist. You literally let yourself outshine yourself in the wrong way. That being said, I give you props (ha!) for going with an English rap and for stepping out of the box editing-wise.  dOrPanthera: Jones is always a lot of fun, and I like that you wanted to come into this week showing another side of yourself. But a part of me wanted to see a clearer distinction between him and you. Or, more to the point, between the types of characters you play each week. Your pyromaniac and your Record DJ and your Asylum Man and your Fur Coat Rapper all give similar types of energy and face. Which, I understand, is a part of your brand as a performer, but if you're going to ask us to accept a new 'persona,' it ought to be very clear ala Bob Ford. Loved the song choice, but the bass line was too loud and I had a hard time hearing the lyrics which hurt the illusion for me. These are minor points, but minor ones seem about all I can make this week.  Shutt_Up: Intros are a risky-ass business but yours was just short enough and tongue-in-cheek enough to work without boring us. Also I think it was necessary that you did, because otherwise I'd be giving you the same note that I gave Babeford about connecting your look to the song immediately. (Also was that a Monster's University reference in there?). The look worked for me and so did the overall concept. But the big issue that I have with this is that while you are living as the housewife jamming out in her kitchen, you're making two mistakes. First, your energy puts you out of connection with the camera every so often. It's a little frantic and a little hard to follow. Second, the song choice isn't that terribly fast and it is also very repetitive (You don't give a fuck is a point that is made over and over). This means that your song isn't giving you chances to evolve the performance from dancing-around-the-kitchen to some other place. And it also costs you a few points in the difficulty department, but you knew that going in."
LSFYL,2an06l,theGstandsforGabriel,2,Tue Jul 15 21:40:49 2014 UTC,"Thanks for your thoughts. Performing is just very much a learning process for me right now & i've certainly got a lot to think about when it comes to performing. But, i've got an idea for next week which I think will break me free from this same mold i've cast myself into thus far: Can't wait to share it. :)"
LSFYL,2an06l,GeminiGaga,3,Mon Jul 14 20:02:13 2014 UTC,"The suggestion that I have to be some sort of paragon of lip syncing in order to have an opinion that can help my fellow competitors grow and improve in this competition would suggest, logically, that nobody who isn't doing the best every week has any right to offer criticism whatsoever which, in this case, would include you criticizing me. My sync, if you actually pay attention to it, is extremely tight. That's not a matter of ego, that's just the observation of somebody with a decent internet connection. And its one that most people share. You're a very new user, so perhaps you haven't caught on to our etiquette here. But if you wanted to come for me the proper way to do it would be to make a separate post and post an accurate and constructive review. Not to put your negatively-spirited vitriol as a reply to my efforts to be helpful. If you don't like my submission this week, don't vote for it. It's so simple. But if you want to try to make this personal you should probably just keep those opinions to yourself because this community is no place for that."
LSFYL,2an06l,theGstandsforGabriel,3,Mon Jul 14 21:13:46 2014 UTC,You need to examine yourself before you criticize others.   Applies to attitude as well.
LSFYL,2an06l,theGstandsforGabriel,5,Tue Jul 15 13:31:25 2014 UTC,Look: I've had my fill of internet trolls already this week and you're starting to sound like a re-run.
LSFYL,2an06l,theGstandsforGabriel,4,Tue Jul 15 15:15:47 2014 UTC,"THIS IS A TWO PARTER. PLEASE SEE REPLY FOR ADDITIONAL CRITIQUES  Here we are, Speed Rap week. A week that puts the most emphasis on knowing the words to your song as well as the accuracy in which those words are hit. The critiques this week and moving forward will be harsher. I will be focusing more on mouth shapes, pick ups and drop off, timing and lyrical accuracy. One of those five may be redundant.. It's early, leave me alone.   This week, as with any other week. I hope you read all critiques you are given to you. I hope you take it in and use each bit in a way to improve your sync for the coming week. Know that when we critique you were giving you areas that you can improve upon. We are not saying that it wasn't a good sync [unless it's explicitly saying that, without any clue as to what could be fixed] Know that we want the best from each of you and know that you can deliver it.  I personally will not be accepting excuses from any contestant moving forward. We all have different factors that affect us and it will always be the case. Accept the critique for you what you turned in.  With that out of the way, let's go ahead and see if you can synca rhyme or if it will more like Dr. Dre's rap career. Dead. Good luck all.    JoanWaters Song Choice - Itty Bitty Piggy. Artist - Nicki Minaj  God that look. The tie in to Kermit. I have watched this more times than I care to admit. The darker lip stick was a good choice for the sync. The sync pretty damn tight. I only caught one instance where you were late coming in on a word. The bit after ""I'mma bad bitch"" was so good, you even got the gulp down. You were very animated in this and of course it being a Minaj song it really calls for it. The way you did it, didn't really distract from the sync. Which is what you want for Minaj. Yes she's crazy and all but you focused the crazy and kept it tight were others may have gone a tad overboard. Miss Pinky Waters just called out and slayed you bitches. Now whachu gon do?  Indepth Breakdown: You were a little late on ""Yankee"". You hit the ""kee"" but the mouth shape going into it didn't seem that defined and part of it got lost. Missed ""All"" in ""All the dope boys""   Where I feel you can improve:  You had wonderful energy and again kept the movements within a decent range as to not really obscure your sync. I'd be careful when you look away from the camera. I don't mean when you just move your eyes, I mean when you move your whole head. Doing that during a sync and if you keep it to a profile like you did, it can hurt it as you don't see as much of the mouth shapes and it makes it easier to kind of flubb the lyrics and get away with it. With someone whose mouth is as rubbery as yours, it would have expected some more exaggerated shapes. You did well to channel Minaj but it could have used just a smidge more. Overall this was a great sync.    TheHarperValleyPTA Song Choice - Monster. Artist- Kayne West [Feat Bon Iver, Jay-Z, Nicki Minaj and Rick Ross]  Not sure if the time of the video was a coincidence or not. I thought the red overlay was good for just the opening but then it didn't go away. I am not sure why you kept it around, I guess it could be being seen through the ""eyes of a monster"" or possibly to help it so that the lips stood out more. However, it was just distracting. This is the first instance of what I will be seeing from a lot of people and that is a lag in the camera. Or to be more precise, the camera not picking up how fast the mouth is going and for a speed rap week. Well you know where I'm going with this. There are instances where it LOOKED as though you were missing pick ups or words. That may be the case, that may not.  Indepth Breakdown:  Rick Ross: Missed ""Jungle""  Chorus 1: Nothing missed.  Kanye: Missed ""none of you who go and"" Hit ""get."" Missed ""Bogus"" Dropped ""Yeah I had to act"" came in on ""Sane"" odd mouth shape at ""do now"" Thing there was two more spots as well  Chorus 2: Nothing.  Jay-Z: At 1:59 as the pick up just happens to about midway into 2:01, you missed the opening word and didn't catch up until ""Lochness"" Word might be wrong, doesn't change the fact though. Dropped the ""niggas know where the swamp is. None of you"" came in on ""niggas"". Seems like you lost ""All I get is these vampires"" there are a few more.  Chorus 3: Nothing.  Nicki: Missed ""Monster Giseppe"" Lost ""Hotter than a middle eastern"" came in on Climate. Missed ""Tony Matterhorn"" hit ""dutty wine it""   Where I feel you can improve: I don't understand the need for the overlay color. Your make up game is always good. Unless this was to tie into the lyric ""Eyes redder than the devil, huh"" it wasn't needed for as long as it was on.  Late getting into chorus after Jay-Z's verse. Nicki's verse is where the camera lag issue comes into play, I don't know if you're hitting some words or not. Your mouth shapes could have been a bit larger for Nicki's part as she distorts her whole damn face when she spit. Movement was good and made sense. No white girl dancing from you this week. Good energy and the lip sync was good as well. Just be careful with mouth shapes during fast bits as some of the words did get lost. This isn't an easy week but you did alright.     TheGstandsforGabriel: Song Choice - Worldwide Choppers. Artist - Tech N9ne ft a whole buncha people.  5:29... Devoting a gat damn half hour to you for this damned cri-- motherfucker. THIS. THIS IS MOTHER FUCKING SPEED RAP. The framing was tight and it needed be for this week and it paid off well for you. Like the Harper, there are spots where you are late or you miss words, but I don't know if that is because of camera lag or you're actually missing it. It will all be below.  Indepth Breakdown:   Opening bits was good.   1st Spitter [Start at :30] You missed the shapes and possibly the entrance for the word ""oddity"" [Range :35 to :37] little more emphasis could have been put on ""Empanadas""  2nd Spitter who I think sounds like Ludacris [Start at :45] This section was good, couldn't clock anything.  3rd Spitter [Start :59 / 1:00] another good section.  4th Spitter [Start 1:14 / 1:15] Mouth shape for Apostle could have been better. Chorus is chorus. Slow enough that you hit.  5th Spitter: [Start at 1:44] This one suffers the most as he is fast as fuck and while there are points when you hit it there are sections where you don't. It's a fast line. Starting at 1:54 to 1:59 it gets lost and it's even tougher to tell as that whole section is in friggin Danish.  6th Spitter: [Start at 1:58 / 1:59] ""With a Photo"" gets lost. ""headed"" is lost. ""Shocks"" is lost. There was another section in there before the ""Don't really need to show"" that words were lost but I can't pinpoint it.  7th Spitter: [Starts at 2:57] ""Breakin' 'em off"" is lost. ""They get in a predicament"" is lost you come in on the next line without problem. ""Colonel"" is lost. I think you lost the opening bit of ""magic"" Missed the opening stutter bit of ""m-m-my"" but hit My so. No points lost.   Busta Rhymes Verse [Starts at 3:57] Good until it hit the ""I'ma be choppin' and cuttin'"" You get a bit lost, the lips are moving but they didn't quite hit the shapes. The stuttering bit was good. ""W-w-w-w-why"" was lost. This was one of your stronger verses.  9th Spitter [starts at 4:56] can't clock anything here and that takes us in to the final spitter [starts 5:10] lead up to ""bullet to the (Brain)"" was a bit lost.  Where I feel you can improve: First I say kudos for being the only person who did a full on speed rap, especially since it has Busta Rhymes. Everyone who spit on this thing was fast as all get out and you, try as you might, did what you could to stay on top of it. At this point in the game, everyone should REALLY be putting in the name of the track and the artist, even if it's painfully obvious, in the description of the video or something because come on. The tight framing helped this sync so much. You lost words and mouth shapes here and there but this is one of your better performances. I wish you gave some more energy or maybe a little more face. While this was a good and pretty solid sync, others might view it as boring despite the difficulty. Bring the energy up.      Babeford Song choice: Dammit, Man. Artist - Pitbull.  It's Pic Kell... >_> shut up. I get the gimmick and it was cute but I don't know. You did have the swagger / thug-like energy so that did help carry this through.  Indepth Breakdown:  You didn't hit the ""The"" in ""Tear this club the fuck up"" Missed ""I'm like"" in the ""I'm like Ray Charles..."" The line ""I'm just too [daddy?]"" was lost because you tried to go for a silly lip thing [before the ""Wooo"" 1:24, which was also dropped]  Next verse [Starting at 1:55] not words lost, but the mouth shapes could have been a bit tighter.   Where I feel you can improve: The costume was cute but it did cause a few issues. Your mouth shapes could have been better in spots or more noticable. You made some weird choices when it came to the sync. You synced the first ""Timer"" but not the second. You didn't catch the ""Wooo"" and during the chrous you were hitting the whole thing. You need to be concious to what parts you will and will not sync. This is the backup singer vs main singer issue again. That said, the energy was there and you felt the song. Also did the cat go running after the pickle when you spit it out?    MORE ON REPLY"
LSFYL,2an06l,KHRoxas,3,Tue Jul 15 15:30:11 2014 UTC,"GeminiGaga Song Choice - Opulence. Artist - Brooke Candy.  I am loving this look. I just wish you brought a bit more energy to this, this is a step up from last week though.  Indepth Breakdown: You were early on an ""Opulence"" before the 2nd verse. Mouth shapes for certain words ""Google me"". I think you missed the opening of ""Couple"" in the ""Couple shots of--"". The 2nd ""underneath the gold rings"" wasn't as pronounced as the first one. The ""Opulence"" before the 2nd ""I own everything baby"" was a bit too quick but you caught yourself midway.  Where I feel you can improve: I still think you need a little bit more work with energy. You had the feel down and you got into it, but I feel there is still some kind of disconnect. Don't be afraid to look silly. Gabe isn't. You did a good job with the sync overall just give us a little more. The rest of it is there. We just need to see you shine more in the performance.    Zoomyx Song Choice - Echo. Artist - Eminem feat Royce da 5'9""  I feel the audio quality could have been a bit better. THIS is how I want to see split screen syncs done. It's not distracting and helps you keep your focus where you need it. I don't know what is going on with left side of your face on the ""boy side"" it's like you have dirt or something on it. No clue if it's makeup, a shadow or what. My focus was on that for a bit.  Indepth Breakdown:  Eminem Verse: You get lost during ""til the last molecule, down to my last follicle and cuticle"". Lost the shaping for ""told these stupid"" and ""when I come back I'm a set this bitch"" I think you miss ""pour"". You miss the ""when I fuck"" in ""when I fuck this world""  Chorus is slow enough where nail each word without issue.  Royce Verse: Missed the shaping for ""Desert Eagle"". ""Get respect form the get go"" gets lost as does ""step to"" before you hit the word ""Echo"". Missed ""to a nine minute"" I think you missed the ""fly""   Where I feel you can improve: Mouth shapes, mouth shapes, mouth shapes and word accuracy. I know this was a tough challenge as english is not your first language coupled with the fact it's a speed rap week. However, you could have put more into it and tried to hit some of those words. It was an alright sync and since this is such a technical week, you need to be hitting everything. This could be a case where like Harper and Gabe before you, the camera may have lagged or just not picked up the speed at which the lips were moving.     d0rPanthera Song Choice - Fierce (Godzilla Version). Artist - Azealia Bank.  I don't know about this. I feel this was a drag queen mix or something. The audio quality isn't the best and that can hurt for a week like this. I couldn't hear Azealia much, but the talking bits were pretty clear. Apparently the quality is a flaw from the source too.  Indepth Breakdown:   Verse 1: You keep the shape for ""Pour"" as it goes into ""Some happy"" and it looks as though you come in on ""Happy"". You hit ""song"" but the shape is too wide for you to hit the opening ""Tiara on my head""  Spoken Bit 1: Fine.  Verse 2: [1:26] Good section.  Chorus: You missed one of ""The House"" [fourth one in the section]  Verse 3: [2:37] You missed the opening of ""You turned"" you mixed your mouth shapes up with ""Gin"" and ""Gym""  ""You running with the wrong sip, rum to the gym"" ""Bambi work it out like felons in a gin"" is what I saw. I think you missed ""I'm better"" in the ""I'm better than a ten""  Where I feel you can improve: Energy was alright. You need to be careful of the mouth shapes. You had good spots but the spots where it was off stuck out. I can't hold the audio quality against you this week as the source of this the same. Try to work more on shapes and exaggeration where it's needed. Not a bad sync though.    Shutt_Up Song choice: I don't give a fuck. Artist: Bo$$.  The idea is cute, but I don't know if you quite hit the mark you were going for. Skit in the beginning wasn't bad but it could have been a bit shorter. You're giving me Mama from Mama's Family and i'm living.  Indepth Breakdown:  Verse 2: You missed ""Crooked"" in ""everyone's running around with a crooked scam"" You didn't hit ""minute"". Missed ""I will beat you"" but came in on down. Missed ""Degree""   Chorus3: The head turn kind of cost you a ""mother fucker""  Verse 3: Head wiggle caused you to miss / lose ""dead ass bitch"" Missed ""Daughters"".  Where I feel you can improve: Give a little more in facial expressions when syncing. I get you were going with a character, but in this instance I felt it hurt your sync more than helped it. As always, mouth shapes. I would work on the timing as well as you could have hit the words you missed. It was cute but wasn't really strong."
LSFYL,2an06l,KHRoxas,3,Tue Jul 15 15:33:25 2014 UTC,Just wanted to say MAJOR KUDOS for doing such an in-depth critique. It must have taken you forever to put all this together!
LSFYL,2an06l,thelettergii,5,Tue Jul 15 15:43:23 2014 UTC,"Another damn difficult week! Thoughts:  /u/joanwaters - A straight up motherporkin' rap star! Bold and memorable, as always. You are the lipsync chameleon, and I don't think there's a single theme that can be thrown at you that you can't handle. You never cease to amaze!  /u/TheHarperValleyPTA - One of my favorite rap songs. I like your choice of filter and the way you set it up. You did an excellent job delivering the attitude and keeping it fun at the same time,  /u/TheGstandsforGabriel - Highest degree of difficulty by far, and you totally crushed it. You have been very consistent throughout this competition consistently safe, that is , but I see that changing...to a WIN after this week. Nice work!  /u/babeford - I'm not sour on your...nope. Can't even finish it. Anyway, I thought it was unconventional and effective. It had a different feel than some of the other songs, which I definitely appreciated. A breath of fresh air.  /u/GeminiGaga - Perhaps the lowest degree of difficulty, but I enjoyed your song choice the most. Your look and attitude served opulence, and I thought it was a TREMENDOUS improvement over last week.  /u/zoomyx - Most effective use of split screen to date. Attitude and performance was a little lopsided though. I wish they were more equal, but that's just nitpicking because your sync was so on point. Another fantastic job!  /u/dOrPanthera - Fabulous song choice. Served character for days, attitude for months, and sync for years. Easily one of the best of the week.  /u/Shutt_Up - Most creative character, hands down. I live for the idea of an uptight suburban mom getting down to ""I Don't Give A Fuck"" and doing the motherfucking cabbage patch. Camp the house down. You have the best white girl dance moves! Nice work!  TL;DR: Fantastic Fuck, I Can't Just Pick Four  /u/joanwaters, /u/TheGstandsforGabriel, /u/dOrPanthera, /u/zoomyx  Fingers crossed for a non-elimination week. Good luck, super talented people!"

So there.  :P  Also thanks so much for your kind words. I was really glad I got this chance to push myself in a more technical direction, though if I could do it over I would have taken it to a more creative place as well (backup dancers, pyrotechnics, etc.)"

The conceptual standouts were   /u/joanwaters & /u/Shutt_Up  /u/TheGstandsforGabriel slayed the house down  thx to /u/Babeford pickles will never be the same  /u/TheHarperValleyPTA is a monster  /u/GeminiGaga nice bounce back from last week.  Now we just need you to ""make love with the camera""  /u/zoomyx this wasn't your best. Your right half wasn't as attuned to the song as the left. You can and you will do better.  /u/dOrPanthera I didn't get the connection between the song and the character but everything else, spot on.  No boots from me this week."

LSFYL,2an06l,alexlopez49411,7,Mon Jul 14 22:26:21 2014 UTC,I noticed that you neglected to include a review for HarperValleyPTA. Why is that? She performed a sync that was just as good as those who you did review.
LSFYL,2an06l,alexlopez49411,7,Tue Jul 15 17:06:48 2014 UTC,"But as a reviewer you should know that fairness is one of the most important traits to have regardless of your personal feelings towards another contestant no matter what they may have said to anyone in the past. If you're going to be reviewing these videos, you have to be fair and evaluate everyone, not just those who you liked or those who ""left a bad taste in your mouth"" for you to not include her, it almost discredits any review you made for the other 7 contestants in general because you are presenting fallacious reviews by attacking the character of another contestant by not even including them."

LSFYL,2an06l,theGstandsforGabriel,4,Tue Jul 15 17:18:13 2014 UTC,"I'll stand by why I said. The person that I was responded to insulted Chris, who is working his butt off to put this whole thing together, and insulted all my friends and fellow competitors. We're a shady bunch, but none of us want that kind of nastiness in this sub. If someone claimed to be a friend or a fan of mine acted that way in here, I'd be mortified. I'm okay losing that vote by saying that what they are doing isn't cool and isn't welcome here. I'm not ""hand-picking"" fans or anything like that, just trying to point out that if trolls are trying to get on their favorite's good side, being a jerk isn't the way to do it. We might be competitors, but we are also friends. If you mess with one of us, you mess with all of us. If you don't like that, i'm sorry, but I'm not going to lose sleep over it."

LSFYL,2an06l,shutt_up,9,Thu Jul 17 02:25:03 2014 UTC,"This is my favorite argument from assholes: ""But I'm helping!""  Let's look at that honestly. You have, I assume, gone to school until at least the 6th grade. Maybe even 8th! Now, think back to your teachers, the ones who were actually helping you to learn and grow. How many of them looked at you and, in front of the whole class, said, ""Well, moneyhenny, your homework was worthless and everyone else is better than you and you should probably quit school. Why anyone likes you is a mystery to me.""  If you got an answer wrong, certainly you were told so. But a good teacher helps you to find the right answer, and to find it in a way where you still feel supported and capable.  Also: your teacher can back up the teaching with actual skill.  So, to recap: everyone else is being helpful. You are full of mouth and free of skill and no one much cares what you think coming correct looks like."

LSFYL,2an06l,theGstandsforGabriel,5,Thu Jul 17 05:37:09 2014 UTC,"Then what the fuck do you think I came here for in the first place?  Critiques involve actually saying something constructive. Negative critiques are fine, and you can talk to anyone about me encouraging that sort of thing, but you said nothing other than ""wow that choice was so obvious and I don't know why everyone loved it"". Which isn't even remotely constructive. You want constructive, you say what they did wrong and how they can work on it, or you can point out something technical. You cannot, wonder of wonders, say ""this sucks because I said so"" and then hide behind the banner of ""I'm only critiquing you!!!"" like a pedantic child who's mommy just told him that he can't keep hitting other children in the face when they disagree with him.  You want to give out critiques, say things that actually matter that aren't directly attacking. Zoomyx had a weaker male part, but the female part was on point. A lot of Babeford's is dependent on her look. That kind of shit. Saying that contestant b sucks because you said so, or just going after the way a person looks in costume/general is just being unhelpful and stupid.  The thing I take the biggest issue with is that you're comparing us. We are not similar. Mostly, because when I try to give critique, I will stop with the jokes and the other bullshit and address them directly. You can ask all the people who have shown their videos to me ahead of time, where I say what I like, what I didn't like, where I could see improvements being made, and so forth and etc. I'm also aware of when I'm being overly dickish, and I know when it's appropriate for me to behave a certain way in one place or another.

If ypu haven't noticed a lot of people have been doing fine in BOTH seasons without doing drag. The fact of the matter is, Gabe's sync was on point. And you're just a faceless person without even showing any effort in competing in this competition. You're comments are consistently vile and so are you.   I thank you."

LSFYL,2an064,alexlopez49411,2,Mon Jul 14 04:00:28 2014 UTC,"Yay carrion critique! As a heads up I'm not very good at critiquing lipsyncs so feel free to take this with a grain of salt.  I think the head bob at the beginning ended up getting off-rhythm, so it threw me off for a bit. Aside from that, your body language was really good! In the future I'd like to see you work on your facial expressions. Work on varying your mouth shapes more (were the grills hindering you?), as well as your eyes. Squint, open them wide. I think your eyes did widen at some points, but it wasn't by a lot.  As for the actual lipsync, you did pretty well. I think you did miss a few words though? But for most of the really fast parts you were great. Great job! :)"
LSFYL,2an064,thelettergii,2,Tue Jul 15 05:56:13 2014 UTC,"First and foremost Thank you so much for taking the time to watch not only my video but as well as all the other Carrion videos, it means a lot to get reviews just like those who are actually in the competition especially because we're growing to get a shot at the title next year and any advice will only help us grow!  As for the critique, I was so into the character I did that I didn't realize that I was making the mistakes I did lol, but next week I'll make sure to fix those things and get the eye movements and mouth movements on point!"
LSFYL,2an064,alexlopez49411,1 point,Tue Jul 15 06:51:07 2014 UTC,"You're welcome! I'm sorry my critique of yours was kinda short, honestly I didn't have much to say because your performance was really great. (The other videos were great too obviously, it was just harder for me to explain what I was looking for sometimes haha)"
LSFYL,2an064,thelettergii,2,Tue Jul 15 16:43:05 2014 UTC,"Yay carrion critique! I'm not very good at this so feel free to take things with a grain of salt.  I'm seriously blown away by the lipsync itself, major props. But I wish you had a little more expression in your eyes. I figure it's because you're focused on getting the rap right, but even during the chorus (which was slightly slower) you had the same look on your face. So maybe for future videos, work on showing emotion with your eyes. Squint them, widen them, raise your eyebrows, look around -- it's all part of body language and body language is a huge part of a lipsync imo.  Other than that, it was great. Really great. Kudos!"
LSFYL,2an064,thelettergii,1 point,Mon Jul 14 13:26:32 2014 UTC,"You almost got it.  Off a little in spots, but I recognize how hard this one was.  I rehearsed this for about six months and didn't think I was ready and didn't make my video."

LSFYL,2an064,Raven_Night,1 point,Tue Jul 15 13:50:02 2014 UTC,"Yay I'm giving carrion critique! Like I said in the chat, I'm not very good at this stuff so you can take this with a grain of salt.  Your lipsync is on point, so I'd like to see you amp up your look and your performance. Both of those were already great, but I think you could turn it up a notch. Because the webcam contrast is low it's kinda hard to see your lips. I think a dark red or black lipstick would not only have helped me focus on them, but it would also have made your look more cohesive. It's also hard to see your eyes because of the glare from your glasses, so maybe heavier eyeliner would have brought your eyes out. But even without makeup, I think your look was great. Your 'do is lovely and your top is awesome. I was just fixated on that a lot and I want to be more fixated on your face.  And like the look, your performance was overall great, but I think you could exaggerate just a bit more. You were conscious of your mouth shapes at some point, but I think on others you were more focused on getting the rap right and your lips didn't really seem like they were moving that much. You could also move your eyebrows a little more, since the glasses might make it hard to see your eyes. And your body movement was great, but I think you could have moved your head more as well. Tilting, bobbing, waggling your head -- that kind of body language would have helped you show some sass.  I had a ton of fun watching your video! I think this type of song fits you really well and I have a new song to add to my playlist. Awesome job :D"

And thank MARIO it was just before speed rap week, because I haven't learned my song for that at all and I would have gone that week for sure anyway.  As the resident Akashia/Milan video game queen of this subreddit it's been a ride full of ups and downs. The takeaway: I feel more comfortable doing mixes on stage than lip syncing to one song in front of a webcam! And that's OK. This competition was still a fabulous challenge that I needed to experience and I'm going to bring what I've learned to my live shows for sure (I already have).  Now, before anyone asks, I DO NOT have ANYTHING to plug. Least of all my Facebook page (friend me!)  There will be nary a comment about my YouTube channel, where you can watch recordings of my live performances and an updated performance reel (coming soon).  And don't you dare ask me to hyperlink my Let's Play of Castlevania: The New Generation , also on YouTube.  And, last but not least, I really don't want to date any of you so don't bother looking at my Christian Mingle account. Ever.

LSFYL,2abz4z,swedskee22,2,Fri Jul 11 03:07:59 2014 UTC,At least he was eliminated on his own accord. If you think about it that means his time on /r/LSFYL was an all-around high :P
LSFYL,2abz4z,thelettergii,2,Fri Jul 11 16:08:49 2014 UTC,the best track record in LYFYL HERSTORY!!!!
LSFYL,2abz4z,swedskee22,10,Fri Jul 11 17:43:00 2014 UTC,"I'm so grateful and HAPPY! Thanks to everyone who voted for me! And aw, heck, I'll even thank the people who didn't vote for me, too! It takes a village to get these Waters wet. I'll do a rain dance for you ladies any day!  I'm personally gonna really miss MikiClash! I'll give that girl a lipsync power-up any day. I know you're a gamer, but you get high scores in real life for serving it up and being nice. Everybody could learn a thing or two from your tutorial level, baby."
LSFYL,2abz4z,joanwaters,2,Thu Jul 10 15:31:29 2014 UTC,You better win!
LSFYL,2abz4z,MikiClash,8,Thu Jul 10 15:43:56 2014 UTC,"Miki I could see every week you were taking what everyone is saying and applying that to next week. Every week you would just keep improving and be gracious with everyone's critiques. Sorry to see you go, dear.    Congratulations on your win, Judy Joan!    Edit: Chris, it's more like Babeferd than Babe Ford. You had it right haha"
LSFYL,2abz4z,Babeford,4,Thu Jul 10 14:17:59 2014 UTC,Thank you lady! It was very important for me to listen and thank EVERYONE for their thoughts (even when they hated my work) because they cared enough to comment.  Longer pre-execution farewell speech to come soon.

Also, just wanted to let everyone know, when dorpanthera gets a win or safe or high (and a low), that mothafucker earned it. No outside fuckery for me.  What a shame, but this got dealt with really well.  And lastly congrats to a contestant very dear to me, the one and only, Miss JOAN J-J-J-JO-AN."

LSFYL,2abz4z,GeminiGaga,8,Thu Jul 10 20:02:58 2014 UTC,"Miki: Honestly i'm a little surprised to see you go this week. You definitely were improving every week. You clearly have a passion for drag that you should definitely keep up with. :)  Joan: YAS GAWD. Even though I don't vote (Because i'm way too indecisive) & I don't even like critiquing my fellow competitors (Because i'm a competitor. & I don't want the editing department to edit me into being a villain this season)- you definitely were one of my faves this week & you totally deserved that win. Like, everything was right about that video. Slay me!   Babeford: Miss thang, me & you: clinging to each other in tears on the dimly lit stage as we barely make it through to Speed Rap (I have an over-active imagination): Lets TURN IT this week, sister! xo"
LSFYL,2abz4z,Babeford,5,Thu Jul 10 14:52:45 2014 UTC,I like to imagine us on a raft in the middle of the storming ocean clinging to each other as the sharks circle around.   Let's bop some noses this week!

LSFYL,2abz4z,GeminiGaga,1 point,Thu Jul 10 15:37:33 2014 UTC,Omg I would love to paint & kiki with you! And you could give me some lipsync tips because apparently I need them to avoid the bottom 3! <3 I'm excited for what you do too. Yay!
LSFYL,2abz4z,TheOneDoc,2,Thu Jul 10 15:44:29 2014 UTC,Girl you alredy got the Raven edit this time around...

LSFYL,2abz4z,MikiClash,3,Thu Jul 10 16:53:58 2014 UTC,Love you baby! Considering carrion-ing with one of my custom drag mixes this week or sometime soon. <3
LSFYL,2abz4z,swedskee22,3,Thu Jul 10 17:30:08 2014 UTC,I have voted every week since season 1...i didnt get to vote this week...im not too happy. wish that the votes in question were just thrown out and an announcement wasnt made that no more votes would be taken. i trust chris enough to do that. idk :/ lame.
LSFYL,2abz4z,swedskee22,6,Fri Jul 11 08:49:40 2014 UTC,"I apologize. There were a couple inconsistencies in quick succession, and I needed time to go back through the other votes that had been submitted to see how big the issue was, and whether there was any other tomfoolery I had missed. I knew that closing voting wasn't ideal, but I had to make a snap decision. I quickly weighed several options, including tossing out all the votes and having no elimination this week, but for better or worse, this is the route I ended up taking. I'm sorry that the early shutdown negatively affected some of you; I'm doing my best with the limited resources available to me."
LSFYL,2abz4z,starlightzone,5,Fri Jul 11 15:01:07 2014 UTC,ok...but only because you used 'tomfoolery' :*
LSFYL,2abz4z,MikiClash,2,Fri Jul 11 17:44:13 2014 UTC,"What happened with the voting doesn't surprise me although I got horrible chills up and down my spine when you were talking. I still can't believe people would go that far. Come on guys. Play fair. Don't be shady, be a lady.  Congratulations to Joan, and a big kiss farewell to MikiClash! I can't wait for speed rap week. I'm going to be hyper critical on all y'all."

LSFYL,2abz4z,thelettergii,9,Thu Jul 10 16:50:02 2014 UTC,Are you serious right now? Ariel announced the eliminated contestant AND the top three in the first 60 seconds of the video. SMDH.
LSFYL,2abz4z,thelettergii,2,Thu Jul 10 22:27:34 2014 UTC,Who's your fave? I'm sure they'd like to know so they can distance themselves from you.
LSFYL,2abz4z,ThePrincessEva,5,Thu Jul 10 16:38:04 2014 UTC,"So you say he's ""kind of cute"" until he allegedly downvotes you (a false assumption you made yourself), and then suddenly he's ""lame and bug-eyed""? No shade, I would just like to understand how you can suddenly change your opinion on his physical appearance based on reddit karma.  Also, are you /u/lindsaymohan on a new account by any chance?"
LSFYL,2abz4z,seamusocoffey,2,Thu Jul 10 17:11:55 2014 UTC,"It's not that hard to figure out. You've called him ""bug eyed"" at some point on both accounts which is a really unusual word to use to describe someone."
LSFYL,2abz4z,GeminiGaga,14,Thu Jul 10 20:13:00 2014 UTC,Joke's on you. Now no one will tell you what the voting scandal is and you'll HAVE to watch the video.
LSFYL,2abz4z,MikiClash,12,Fri Jul 11 03:40:36 2014 UTC,Girl this is not cute at all. Don't do this.

LSFYL,2abz4z,druidcandy,10,Fri Jul 11 16:18:55 2014 UTC,I'm confused... Were you trying to read? Because right now it just looks like you're being hateful. Kindly step off.
LSFYL,2abz4z,druidcandy,10,Thu Jul 10 16:56:22 2014 UTC,The best part is that I'm not even the one who's downvoting these posts.
LSFYL,2abz4z,Raven_Night,9,Thu Jul 10 17:01:20 2014 UTC,"There are ways around it, if you use the resources available to you.  You are coming for someone who you really have no reason to come for. You are simply hurling childish insults and rather lame attempts to throw shade. Leave the school yard bullying to the kids. You're an adult. Please act accordingly.  If you feel you can do a better job then put up or shut up. Try out for Season 3 next summer.  If you're at work then just wait until you get home to watch it. It's honestly not that long.  I do suggest changing your attitude in general when you comment here because believe me when I say, any and all attempts you make to throw shade or insult Chris, any past or any current contestants, will be promptly and swiftly shut down. Do not come for these children. I may not be as eloquent as some of the others when it comes to this but I will not side idly by while someone tries to throw shade or insult someone else when they have no place or right to do so."
LSFYL,2abz4z,ForestfortheDraois,8,Thu Jul 10 17:02:00 2014 UTC,"""Promptly"" means that the time between now and the beginning of the event will be short. ""Swiftly"" means that the time between the beginning and the end of the event will be short. They mean two distinct things and are not the least bit redundant. Stop being unpleasant and go pick up a book yourself."
LSFYL,2abz4z,KHRoxas,8,Thu Jul 10 18:21:12 2014 UTC,"Hi, reading comprehension? What did I just type? Go pick up a dictionary. ""Dinner will begin promptly"" means that dinner will happen soon. You could still eat that dinner slowly. Trust me, I have a degree in this and have worked for a literal decade as a professional editor. You might not understand the difference between the two words, but that's because you're being dense, not because they're synonyms."
LSFYL,2abz4z,ForestfortheDraois,9,Thu Jul 10 17:14:23 2014 UTC,"Because if I ban you then you get to feel self-righteous and scorned. I'd rather let you run your mouth so that you can experience being told forcefully and repeatedly how ignorant, incorrect, and rude you are. Maybe the experience will even knock some sense into you.  Seriously, though: why ARE we arguing? You keep diving back in. You don't like me, you don't like my videos, you don't like the factual definitions of words... you are here entirely to be mean and angry. What are you getting out of this?"
LSFYL,2abz4z,ForestfortheDraois,6,Thu Jul 10 17:28:35 2014 UTC,"but the phase means, essentially, that in a short time from now, someone will quickly shut you down.  It isn't redundant.  If you come for someone, a very small amount of time will pass before someone takes a small amount of time to stop you.  Promptly and swiftly.  Calm yourself."
LSFYL,2abz4z,TheHarperValleyPTA,8,Thu Jul 10 17:31:52 2014 UTC,"So, Chris responds to your whiny crybaby ""hold my fucking hand""  response with an emoticon and you immediately go off on him for no reason? And I'm the nasty one?  I'd like to see examples of when I've been nasty to people I'm not friends with, who didn't at least deserve it first :) And before you mention any of the other contestants, I'm (I'd like to think I'm) friends with them, and none of them have told me otherwise.  I'm not even that sure why I was brought up, other than you're an idiot. But you already proved that by picking a fight with the entire sub."
LSFYL,2abz4z,TheHarperValleyPTA,6,Thu Jul 10 17:36:36 2014 UTC,"Alright, thanks Laganja.  If I was nasty to you, odds are you deserved it since you're not supplying an actual source, and you felt the need to make a new account to talk shit about Chris, me, and other people.  I'm assuming it's related to /r/rupaulsdragrace/ because you sound like you're Tom Petty without the Hearbreakers, but I really don't know how I personally hurt you and only you.  And I don't like accepting dumb bullshit either, so yes, I'm going to call you out on randomly getting me involved in a conversation I have nothing to do with like a bitch. You don't have to apologize, but you probably should look at what you're doing if people are consistently disagreeing with you."

You have no real problem with him, you are just lashing out because you're not getting the info you want due to the inability to look at youtube while at work.  I know he can handle criticism but that's not what you're doing. You're acting like a child who isn't getting their way so you resort to petty insults. I kindly ask that you take several seats.  Lastly, I strongly suggest you once again check your attitude and your tone before you post here."
LSFYL,2abz4z,girlswhatsmyweakness,9,Thu Jul 10 19:17:32 2014 UTC,"That's how hated you are with your shitty words.  The drag family can make the impossible possible just for trolls like you.  Now, kindly shut the fuck up, watch Chris's video when you get a chance, and stop being a Bitter Betty.    You must like nachos.  He never did give out those nachos he promised from last year.  I know deep down I'm still angry, but I've mostly moved on and just made videos of me eating them really slowly for five minutes."
LSFYL,2abz4z,starlightzone,6,Thu Jul 10 19:29:38 2014 UTC,"I know! You should see me do Shakespeare: ""To troll, or not to troll.  That is the question.  Whether 'tis nobler to suffer, the slings and arrows of Moneyhenny's bullshit.  Or to take arms against a sea of Oh Honey, no you didn't."""
LSFYL,2abz4z,joanwaters,9,Thu Jul 10 19:36:55 2014 UTC,"You clearly enjoy the competition, so why be so rude to the person taking the time to put it together? Super uncalled for.

LSFYL,2a81bw,RhondaOdyssey,2,Wed Jul 9 23:21:25 2014 UTC,"I don't know what changes when you're editing this but Kyle always sounds louder than Carrie. You can do a higher voice but you can also make it loud enough so you don't fade into the background.  I don't think the make up was too good this week. Yes, you were at the limits of what you had. However your face looked a good deal darker than the rest of you and that boob contour was way too dark. You weren't shiny this week so that's good.   I don't know what kind of foundation you use but I would try to find out that is closer to your actual skin tone so you don't end up looking like someone who smattered that spray tan stuff on their face and called it a day.  Try to keep the lighting consistent. I think you said you did Carrie earlier in the day - at least that is what I remember from the Tiny Chat -Kyle was a little darker."
LSFYL,2a81bw,KHRoxas,1 point,Wed Jul 9 16:37:46 2014 UTC,"There were a LOT of problems getting this video done this week.  The core of the makeup problem was the only foundation I could get my hands on was too dark for my skin tone.  As for the rest of it, I actually filmed Carrie later in the day, and because I don't have a real green screen with me, the substitute color NEEDS bright lighting to work properly.  I had to do a ton of color correction on Carrie's half of the vid, which is why she's so much brighter and the contrast on the contouring is way darker than it was in actuality.  The plan is to have all my new makeup shipped by friday, so as long as I can film with the proper light I should be able to fix it.  As for Carrie's volume, I'll make sure to check that next time.  I think I probably changed my computer volume in between setting Kyle and Carrie's levels and didn't notice."
LSFYL,2a81bw,theGstandsforGabriel,2,Wed Jul 9 16:50:48 2014 UTC,"Ehh, no accounting for song choice. I was feeling everything you were saying when I was making the video, but I really have a connection with that song and wanted to do it the best service I could and I'm gonna do me and blah blah blah. It's a gamble to that song to start with, and apart from the fact that it's not a standout anthem on its own I'd like to think I did something fun with it.  Either way, glad that the two of your are still putting in the work to send this out every week."
LSFYL,2a81bw,Babeford,2,Wed Jul 9 16:43:33 2014 UTC,Thanks CK! I'm using iMovie for iPad so that definitive line wasn't my choice. I had no idea how to get rid of it ): I'm glad you liked my video!
LSFYL,2a81bw,GeminiGaga,2,Wed Jul 9 16:52:45 2014 UTC,"Told ya before that if I danced, it would make me look more silly than it would present energy lol. But, thanks for pointing out some things I can work on & thanks for watching the video. :)"
LSFYL,2a81bw,Raven_Night,2,Wed Jul 9 14:16:04 2014 UTC,"Just a note on this. For me, when giving a lot of energy that translates well it feels a bit silly. When you're doing videos or picture you have to exaggerate a bit to make it apparent, so yes you'll feel goofy but it will be worth it in the end. Thats just my experience with it in both this competition but with being in front of a camera outside of this as well."
LSFYL,2a81bw,GeminiGaga,1 point,Wed Jul 9 15:15:48 2014 UTC,"I'm going to work on this. Dancing (like, choreographed, planned out, dancing) is just not something I enjoy, or am comfortable with. And the dance moves I do do only fit a small number of songs... mostly from like the 1920's-40's?: wagging fingers and shoulder-bopping and jazz-hands and that sort of thing LOL.  So instead, I usually focus on movements similar to drag queens like Raven where her movements are mostly just timed poses: Something I am also working on. (I'm just giving you backstory explanations on my internal processes here. lol)  The majority of my 'performing' takes place in my car, blasting music, so, i'm used to mostly upper body movements: small and subtle, and 'looking away from the camera' is probably something I am used to doing because I look in my rear view mirrors. I just need to work on adapting for a non-car setting lol."
LSFYL,2a81bw,GeminiGaga,2,Wed Jul 9 15:27:58 2014 UTC,"Something I'd recommend then is using a tighter frame for your syncs.  One of the ways to make something feel more dynamic is having more movement around the video you're watching; If your primary energy and movement is going to be focused on your face and arms, we don't need to see your legs.  For example, look at Joan's videos (I'm not saying imitate Joan, just giving an example).  Joan generally isn't doing a ton of movement, but because we have such a tight frame on her face we still get the sense of movement.  This also might help with some of your camera problems.  With a tighter frame, you can cheat your location more to make it feel less cramped."
LSFYL,2a81bw,Raven_Night,1 point,Wed Jul 9 15:43:26 2014 UTC,"Well I felt like I was going for this in the Audition week and Week 1. But then people said 'Stand up, move around more' so that's why we are where we are now. I'll spend more time & care to the camera for this week & figure something that works well for me & for the viewers."
LSFYL,2a81bw,GeminiGaga,2,Wed Jul 9 15:47:23 2014 UTC,"I hear ya cause I do the same thing. Like I said, and especially when you do a Divine song, be goofy! Flail, exaggerate, etc. just feel the music. Do a few takes if you can and see what moves ya like and ones you don't. Then keep doing them and they'll feel less goofy and wacky. This is a kind of thing I do since  I am super awkward about any dancing, especially for practical strangers on the internet."
LSFYL,2a81bw,Letsshootthequeen,1 point,Wed Jul 9 16:12:42 2014 UTC,Haha agreed! Well i'll keep working on my movements. :)

LSFYL,2a6raa,ForestfortheDraois,3,Wed Jul 9 04:39:10 2014 UTC,Yasssssssssss!!!!! I wish I had like at least half the talent you do.... Amazing.
LSFYL,2a6raa,Garbanian,2,Wed Jul 9 00:31:41 2014 UTC,Garbanian's picture reminds me of how sad I am that he's no longer competing and can't twirl his beard into tentacles for his Ursula impression for Disney week.
LSFYL,2a6raa,ForestfortheDraois,2,Wed Jul 9 05:14:30 2014 UTC,I can practice some Ursula stuff for ya. Always wanted to.
LSFYL,2a6raa,Garbanian,1 point,Wed Jul 9 23:42:01 2014 UTC,Senpai I would be honored.
LSFYL,2a6raa,Garbanian,2,Thu Jul 10 01:10:37 2014 UTC,I'll see what I can do starting next week. I'll get some grease make up and all pay day.
LSFYL,2a6raa,ForestfortheDraois,2,Thu Jul 10 01:14:11 2014 UTC,So I ended up getting a speeding ticket and can't afford the make up. OOPS Is there some sort of song you'd like to see me do instead? :P
LSFYL,2a6raa,Garbanian,1 point,Wed Jul 16 21:23:07 2014 UTC,"I'd be happy with you doing that song without anything.  Or anything, really. :D  Sorry about the speeding ticket."
LSFYL,2a6ykj,UEH,6,Wed Jul 9 00:00:57 2014 UTC,I'M GAGGING. I need Noah to be on this show every week.
LSFYL,2a6ykj,joanwaters,2,Wed Jul 9 03:30:04 2014 UTC,I had ALL the fun. If any eliminated people can't make it I'm happy to fill in and talk shit for 15 minutes in their place.
LSFYL,2a6ykj,Noahk519,5,Wed Jul 9 14:19:29 2014 UTC,"Biggest take-away from this week's show: Leafy wants to punch a baby.   Noah, you're so charismatic. Just watching you talk to these two bitches is fun in and of itself. If I had any talent I'd do a Mama June drawing with a flower in her hair for you!"
LSFYL,2a6ykj,ThePrincessEva,4,Wed Jul 9 00:27:13 2014 UTC,"Haha well I'd love to be a standby cohost in case of emergency, like if leafy goes to jail for punching babies"

LSFYL,2a6ykj,Letsshootthequeen,3,Thu Jul 10 01:08:24 2014 UTC,"Sorry, but what? I was the one to originally come up with this idea for the talk show (brought it up to UEH because he told me he wanted to start making more original content) and put a lot of work into this project. I'm sorry that I am not talkative enough for your liking, but I gave the idea over to UEH to headline because I felt like he would be the much better host since he seems to have a better relationship with all of the new contestants. I do almost ALL of the behind the scenes communication and planning for each episode. Talk shows are are always about the host and the guest, while I feel the supporting role. I'm here to control conversation and keep everything on schedule, so I'm sorry I'm not a ""personality"" taking away from our guests who take the time to talk to two random guys on the internet. I know my role and I stick to it. I am glad you enjoyed Noah as a guest and I hope we have great episodes in the future like we had with him.   BYE  p.s. comments like these are how you get downvoted on a sub that doesn't even have that option. Congratulations. Thank you for watching the show."
