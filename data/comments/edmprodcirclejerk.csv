edmprodcirclejerk,3dl8m7,GeneEshays,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:25:12 2015 UTC,"What I love about them most is that they don't lie about a bad mix, unlike KRKs.

edmprodcirclejerk,3dl8m7,birdsnap,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:29:46 2015 UTC,"f   Honestly I think spending the money on treating the room better first will give you far better results. Buy an omnidirectional mic and test your room with roomeqwizard and see if there's lots of huge nulls and peaks, because if there are, better monitors will not fix them in any way."
edmprodcirclejerk,3dl8m7,Millon1000,2,Fri Jul 17 13:00:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'll look into that. Definitely couldn't hurt and won't cost much either. I'm gonna upgrade my monitors regardless, just because I know these Rokits aren't as accurate as they should be for where I've gotten to in my production, and they do lack low end. As for room treatment, I tried to follow this SOS guide for placing my foam as closely as I could, and the sound is quite nice and even right in my mixing spot in front of my desk. It's just that the moment you move a couple feet over that the sound kind of goes to shit. The only thing more I could really do in this room I'm in is build rockwool bass traps, which I may do at some point."

People use buzzwords like dynamics without even knowing proper context to them and it ends up confusing people to no end down the line. That subreddit is a cesspool of misinformation and general production tips. I want to write up a rant about it, but honestly what's that point?   [RANT IMMINENT SORRY IN ADVANCE]  Literally the only thing left that I would consider helpful on that sub would be the plug.dj seshes every Wednesday and Saturday. I've gotten some of my best advice during that crazy chat spam, and honestly, some of my best critiques as well. It helped me to look objectively at my own work, and work of others. It helped me to distinguish critique from criticism, something that the newer sub members have no fucking clue about. There was literally a thread a few weeks back about how we should be nicer to the new community, and about how nobody seems to understand why the oldfags are so hostile towards newbies, while in all my time there, I've seen like 3 people that are blatantly assholes. The rest tended to be helpful critique with SOME sort of advice on how to improve, or at least a link pointing you in a right direction. This is just the tip of the fucking iceburg for me as well.   There is blatant ignoring of faq threads (those posts are literally 20 minutes apart btw) that could be easily fixed with a fucking sticky from the mods, or even a simple scroll to the sidebar. But that's wishful thinking to think that anyone would even GIVE A SHIT while posting there.   Sorry to come off as ranty and bitter, but honestly I'd be lying to say that I'm not."

It just sucks that it has become what it has become, but that's the price you pay when something becomes accessible. Looking at the bright side there's a lot of new talent and places to find answers, they're just hidden among all the shit there is.   That's unfortunate because I'm not an expert either, I've only been producing for 3 years as a hobby and I still cry when I compare my songs to the artists I admire. However, and I don't give advice if I don't know what I'm talking about, and I think that's what a lot of people should learn to do: shut up and listen."

edmprodcirclejerk,3cv93j,Aurelleah,0,Sun Jul 12 14:11:22 2015 UTC,"Not angry at all! Though yeah, 3 years ago when I first started teaching myself how to play I did a couple covers  /unjerk actually you're right they're remarkably supportive, and without the community I wouldn't've ever had gotten the views and subs I have. The ability to go viral in a community is a lot higher when you tailor content to what a group of people relate to on an emotional level. That's why my melodic dubstep remix wound up with so many views in a month, I remixed a song that a lot of people in the community liked.   So there's a trade, of sorts. I deal with the shaming, ridicule and teasing and in return I get way more publicity and free advertising than I would otherwise, and they get music they enjoy that's themed about something they relate to - Thats the reason I made the OP, the community's doing a lot of my publicizing for me (and if I wana go play live at a convention I can, but wont, cause I cant dj worth shit and the thought of trying petrifies me) and I was wondering if there was anything else I'd need to worry about that a label would do otherwise  /jerk uh I mean... But dat soundgoodizer doe"

(And I'm a legit fan). I was just listing the benefits to having a community that supports you and thought for a sec you were actually being reasonable, my bad tho - thanks for clearing that up  Edit: 673btw"
edmprodcirclejerk,3cv93j,IAmTheBauss,0,Sun Jul 12 17:12:25 2015 UTC,being a brony is a good life
edmprodcirclejerk,3cv93j,mushrooshi,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:06:36 2015 UTC,"realtalk, the best support you're going to have in the fandom is producer friends you can trust to give you good advice and the small handful of fans that actually like your production, and if you do convention performances, give you experience on how to and how not to fuck up before you go out into the real world and possibly ruin your rep permanently with your local scene. A good chunk of your brony fans, especially if your tracks are chock full with show samples or fandom memes, are going to like it for the pony shit. When you start to make non-fandom-related stuff, a good number of your brony fans will completely ignore it or ask why you stopped making the ""fluttershy bronystep""  Brony fan numbers are kind of inflated because a lot of them will not translate when you decide to step out of the fandom. It takes an absurd amount of followers to keep any useful ""momentum"", but more importantly, it takes actual talent and skill to recapture the same kind of following or bigger on the mainstage vs the manestage. When you look at followers for folks like Alex S (now known as Andromulus) and Silva Hound and such, they have large numbers and deffo have an active following but the ""buzz"" I see from their non-brony track releases honestly acts like an magnitude of order lower than you'd expect from their raw numbers.  more or less. if you take out the candy colored equines. does your sound still have any reason for people to check it out? and how many of the brony fans actually like it for the music, vs because its about ponies?"
edmprodcirclejerk,3cv93j,Kyderra,0,Thu Jul 16 00:13:12 2015 UTC,"I need to /unjerk for a moment  You know how to pander to the Brony community and what they like, let's not get carried away now and assume that translate to likable music for the majority of people.  That kinda trait is good if you are indeed making music for that community but it's not going to help the OP asking about a label and promoting his music.  The music itself on the channel is.... mediocre to my personal liking compared to other Brony artist, but thats parlty because I don't like said style of (mostly) dubstep.   Most artist don't make Dubstep music that most Bronies enjoy hence they get less views and subs."
edmprodcirclejerk,3cv93j,Aurelleah,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:24:46 2015 UTC,"Well of course I'm not gonna compare to artists like woodentoaster, TLT or ken ashcorp by any standards - I make the kind of music I enjoy myself, and I just wana be clear my OP wasn't asking about how to promote my music - It was about if labels did anything besides promoting music.  And my music is actually mostly orchestral, I only have 3 dubstep songs and 10ish orchestral. I make the kind of music I enjoy and I make it for the community because I love the community. But I make the music first and foremost cause it's what I like to listen to, more than anything. Others seem to enjoy it too when I show them (non bronies included)  Dont forget this was originally a circlejerking about an arrogant statement I'd made about how I don't care about promotion, how I'm okay with going it alone, not the fandom I'm a part of"

All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions.

And that's how it should be, people just wanna make music and have it easy. Accessibility is not a bad thing, it just brings a lot of newcomers and then things like r/edmp happen.   But, by all means, if you're interested in whatever digital signal processing is then go for it, but it doesn't mean that anyone who wants to be a producer must know about those topics.

Buttons are typically made out of hard material, usually plastic or metal.  The surface is usually flat or shaped to accommodate the human finger or hand, so as to be easily depressed or pushed. Buttons are most often biased switches, though even many un-biased buttons (due to their physical nature) require a spring to return to their un-pushed state.

As the children get older their life force gets more aggressive and dank. This causes the ghosts to get more stoned, helping the children make more righteous bangers. Unfortunately due to their success attracting hunnies, many broducers become so drained of energy that none is left for the ghosts who leave to find new hosts. By the time the  typical broducer is in his mid 20s he is simply a husk of his former self, with no life force left to offer. he will spend the rest of their years idling away on internet forums and complaining about younger broducers being better than them."

I recommend KeroVee as a free tuning option. The best versions of Autotune and Melodyne have learning curves like a synth would.  For completely artificial lead vocals, there are Vocaloid and CeVio, and a few expensive choir vocal instruments meant for movies and video games.

edmprodcirclejerk,39q540,homeyG75,5,Sat Jun 13 17:49:16 2015 UTC,I wonder how many people in those posts know how to play more than one note at a time without sounding like shit.

edmprodcirclejerk,39lofp,homeyG75,-5,Fri Jun 12 20:29:06 2015 UTC,"Today I drove with my friends to the lake. My driver isn't that great of a driver. We had to drive for about 45 minutes along a curvy, bumpy, one-lane (seriously, one lane) road along a hillside. Driving off the road would result in certain death. Keep in mind we had to drive past a couple cars and trucks. And we were on the side of the road that would result in falling off if just barely turning to the right. I have a pretty deep fear of heights. Don't think I've had more physical cringes in my life.  Is that post really what makes you 'cringe'? No offense, but how do you even walk outside of your house or socialize with people if you are that weak? I'm gonna go ahead and assume that you didn't cringe at all, because if you did as much as you claim you did, that's pretty embarrassing."

edmprodcirclejerk,38x5zr,duckcall,12,Sun Jun 7 17:20:51 2015 UTC,"/unjerk: FM8 Fl Studio patcher setup resampled in harmor, but sound can also be achieved using Sytrus in patcher, or even FM8 in an ableton rack.  Basically this utilizes parallel vocoding by vocodex and parallel EQ modulation. The WOW filter adds I tiny bit of character, but is not responsible for the growly formants. The FM8 patch is pretty phat sounding to start with and I modulate a bandpass feeding back into FM to generate movement. The harmor resampling adds some wetness which tops the patch off pretty nicely.  Screenshot, red is automation, yellow is audio, greem is midi/VFX input"

edmprodcirclejerk,38x5zr,specialeyez,3,Sun Jun 7 18:23:36 2015 UTC,I actually learned how to make something in this subreddit
edmprodcirclejerk,38x5zr,specialeyez,2,Sun Jun 7 20:29:16 2015 UTC,/unjerk nice m8. I tried being skrillex in Reason a year ago and made this bass patch - https://soundcloud.com/specialeyes/experimental-jam-session-1/s-ncLZ0  It sounds like shit mostly because I was using a mod env to control the sweeping bandpass filters instead of a unipolar LFO.
edmprodcirclejerk,38x5zr,duckcall,3,Sun Jun 7 19:04:33 2015 UTC,"/unjerk bandpassing is actually pretty good at acheiveing growly stuff, this is bandpasses, compression and vocdex on a sytrus patch... sdaly I no longer have the patcher preset rip https://clyp.it/mmuspuru"
edmprodcirclejerk,38x5zr,legreekguy,2,Sun Jun 7 19:14:57 2015 UTC,"/unjerk sounds good m8. The reason patch I made was a huge learning experience since there's no VSTs in Reason so I had to make it with their internal synths. (6 thors, 3 with sine wave analogs oscillators to feed into the bandpass filters, 1 modulator syth to feed into the carriers (sawtooth wave), 1 for dat dere subbass)   /jerk - that shit needs about 8 or 9 more soundgoodizers m8."
edmprodcirclejerk,38x5zr,legreekguy,2,Sun Jun 7 19:24:56 2015 UTC,"thanks! huge effect chain, it's always difficult to do routing like that without patcher in Logic.   One question though: what do you mean ""bandpass feeding back into FM""?"
edmprodcirclejerk,38x5zr,NEStendog,2,Mon Jun 8 04:50:59 2015 UTC,"In FM8 you can FM the operators with Z and X, the filter and waveshapper. So I am routing a bunch of chained operators into the filter then FM another operstor with the filter output.  You said you cant do complex chains in logic, its true that its jard but not impossible, you can acheive it by sending the audio to busses and routing stuff n shit then manualy automation everything.  Another alternstive would be using Minhost Modular as a plugin. Minihost is like patcher but is desighed for other DAWs and supports VST/AU bridging (and will eventually support 32/64 bridging) I havent had a need to mess around with it too much, but you should check it out!"

edmprodcirclejerk,370pub,pointless_answer,4,Sat May 23 19:54:15 2015 UTC,"sorry to disapoint but white noise can easily be ""tuned"" (not really tuned, you're just adding a tone to it like OP said).  put like a 6 db boost with a somewhat narrow Q and you can easily hum the pitch along with it. You could play melodies with it if you wanted to. The only retard here is you.  plus lets say you bounce your white noise to audio, you can repitch it and ""tune"" it. Sure white noise doesn't have a single mode of harmonic spectrum so it will never be in tune with anything that way, but it will be higher or lower, which will add artifacts and change it's formant, you are in fact tuning it. You're not tuning it to a key, but it's still tuning it. When you tune drums in real life most of the time you're not tuning it to a key, you're tuning it to a nice sound. Tuning white noise would still be an appropirate word, you'd just be tuning it to a different sound, just not to a key.  You're are an noob faggot who doesnt know what hes talking about."

edmprodcirclejerk,370pub,chunter16,-5,Sat May 23 21:11:33 2015 UTC,"Try boosting a note like C with a high Q peak filter at every octave (262hz, 523hz, 1047hz, and so forth) on an EQ for a channel playing white noise if you want to see what I'm talking about."
edmprodcirclejerk,370pub,tadhgerty,6,Sat May 23 21:24:02 2015 UTC,"You have a long way to go. Edit: maybe not a long way, but if you stick with it, when you have a better grasp, you'll understand how to use dissonance properly and keep EQ from wrecking a mix. What you described is not tuning a white noise, it's a basic synth technique."
edmprodcirclejerk,370pub,chunter16,-2,Sat May 23 21:50:51 2015 UTC,"I think you're either misinterpreting what I'm saying or out of your depth here. If you sweep a filter with a very high resonance the resonant peak creates a rising or descending tone. On white noise this sounds like sine wave moving up or down in pitch. Having considered that, with an EQ you can make the noise statically resonate at any frequency by boosting it (without a high Q it just sounds like a regular boost, but very high Q results in a tone being emitted)."
edmprodcirclejerk,370pub,tadhgerty,2,Sat May 23 22:22:35 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to be nice about this.  You're describing an elementary technique. When you're good at it, it sounds like the whistle tone on this. When you're boring, it sounds like a hiss riser. You're not tuning the white noise, you're getting rid of parts of it until you end up with a tone. The sound made depends more on the filter than the source noise."
edmprodcirclejerk,370pub,chunter16,2,Sat May 23 23:02:25 2015 UTC,"It seems to me like you're just being really picky with your semantics. You are both describing the same thing as far as I can tell, but you object to his use of the word tuning. It doesn't seem that far fetched of a use, and at least to me gets his point across. He's not unaware of how am eq works so your second last sentence seems a bit catty to me. Also going off point just to mention that what he is talking about is elementary and sounds bad when poorly implemented serves no purpose other than to put him down."
edmprodcirclejerk,370pub,ixcibit,2,Sat May 23 23:40:55 2015 UTC,"You're right. I guess I could've said ""don't call that tuning, that's why the post was made"" but I assume the point is understood now. You can resume the cj whenever you want."

How the hell do people make those tracks that get featured on Spinnin'? Geez man, at first I and others laughed at the tracks that came out on Spinnin and other mainstream labels for sounding so similar and unoriginal, but now I understand how difficult it is to make a even a tolerable big room track.

All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile. It’s normal to take awhile.

Dildo France fell in love with the Moomins. He even married one. The rhytm head in Moombahton is actually originated from the Moomin tribal drum rhytms, which Dildo France learnt to love on his adventures in the Moominland.   Eventually Dildo broke up with his moomin girlfriend and he moved back to France. Even though his relationship ended pretty roughly, Dildo remembered the Moomin culture with warm thoughts. He began to compose sick beats based on the Moomin tribal vibes, he decided to call it Moombahton, as a legacy to the Moomins. The Baton part comes from the time he was beat up by 3 racist police men.   So yeah thats the story behind Moombahton."

edmprodcirclejerk,35cop4,iamonapig,4,Sat May 9 03:37:18 2015 UTC,ozone presets are good but they include ones like mastering acoustic guitar and orchestra and harmonica which is stupid because little do they know these genres do not need to be mastered because they're so technically inferior whereas trap and dubstep and electro and futture bass and maybe drum and bass too if youre strange need mastering because of all the technical skill in them such as playing chords and using synth  my favourite ozone preset is the one i made myself because i dont use other producers presets because thats how losers make music so i made one with all the settings done so when i finish a song all i do is put that on and then it's loud and rich and dynamic and full of spunk so i can upload it straight to soundcloud anyway did you know on ableton theres a button that uploads straight to soundcloud i think that's because the audio engine is so good  anyway thanks for your question but if youre using presets youre not mastering correctly i remember my granny used a preset on the microwave to warm up her soup so i didn't get her a christmas present because im not supporting that weak ass fake microwave dynamic do you understand

edmprodcirclejerk,35cop4,IKISmax,3,Sat May 9 03:51:34 2015 UTC,"ha ha ha very good question and let me tell you whilst there is no right way and wrong way there is MY way which is the BEST way so LISTEN UP and you might learn something  i start out with an eq and set it to mid side and what this does is allow you to eq the MIDDLE (about 600-5000) frequencies seperate from the others whilst still adding bass to them which makes them sound a lot thicker so add a big 20db low shelf to the side don't be shy it wont bite  then comes the multiband dynamic which you can think of as 4 compressors which each compress different frequencies in the mix and there really isn't any penalty for smashing each compressors threshold down to -40db and the ratio to near infinite as all it will do is add punch depth pressure and intensity to your song. if you get stuck try turning the limiters on too but don't use the gates or you'll lose valuable frequencies like 50hz my favourite frequency  next comes harmonic exciter and what this does is increase the amount of excitement in your track so if it sounds really boring and dull you basically use this to get your track - and the crowd - excited and i use the tape setting because i remember as a child last week i listened to my first tape and it was my mum's duran duran or abba tape and the first thing i thought was ""wow sick harmonics"" which is what everyone thinks of with tapes so make sure you turn it all the way on  finally theres the limiter now don't be intimidated by the scary look it's quite nice actually it's basically a big compressor so pull the threshold right down and wow can you believe how good your song sounds now it sounds loud deep and professional one thing i will say is though theres this thing called dithering and all it does is add high frequency noise into the song which is stupid why would i need that i mean i guess if your song is low on high end then you could use it but you should have fixed this in the mix really it just doesn't make sense  anyway i hope you have learned a lot now you can be a mastering professional too just like me take it easy buddy have a great day and don't be afraid to make mistakes life is a rollercoaster and after the climb comes the drop just like electro and you might have to fight your way through life sometimes like when my dad asked me to wash the dishes after we had dinner so i was late to my raiding party on world of warcraft but in the end we still beat the raid so don't let the little things grind you down thank you"

My grandad told me about it a couple of months ago that skrillex grampa Tom Skriddle was gonna play at that event but eventually canceled due to the shit storm that followed because he was supporting fake artists.

edmprodcirclejerk,34yk7o,dark_cat,-1,Fri May 8 01:55:03 2015 UTC,The best thing about Aphex Twin is how he managed to make everybody believe that he's some sort of weirdo that does everything on super vintage analogue recorded live on tapes and stuff.... Seriously the first time I was listening to Sirro I could recognize at least 6  FM8 presets and at least 7 Vengeance loops.... in the first 30 seconds of the album. The dithering noise also screams Garageband all over it.

edmprodcirclejerk,34auq3,user260311376,10,Wed Apr 29 18:00:44 2015 UTC,"What gives big room EDM its distinct sound is the reverb the broducers put on their master. Too get the cavernous sound they set their decay time to 20 seconds or more and wet/dry mix at 100% wet. So to answer your question, medium room EDM is produced by putting a 3-7 second decay time on your master reverb, thus digitally creating a virtual ""medium sized room"" for your banger to reside in. Also make sure to put at least 7 soundgoodizers and sausage fattners in your chain AFTER the reverb."
edmprodcirclejerk,34auq3,666doge,4,Wed Apr 29 19:42:58 2015 UTC,"This!! It's so imperative that a medium room broducer puts the soundgoodizer and sausage fattner AFTER the reverb ask deadmau5, skrillex, or even daft punk and everyone will agree especially as they are the kings of medium room. #1 rule. And don't forget to use automated mastering services online to ensure best quality"

edmprodcirclejerk,34auq3,IAmTheBauss,3,Thu Apr 30 02:45:31 2015 UTC,move your mac book into a smaller room  it is a common mistake for newer producers to accidentally design and export their projects in rooms with too much square footage. you want to keep it minimal for maximum compression and huneys.

edmprodcirclejerk,341qqs,Zaii,12,Mon Apr 27 18:30:45 2015 UTC,your master should be peaking well into the red to make proper dubstep. I would say your master should be anywhere between 13 to 26 db OVER the 0 db threshold to have your wubs DYNAMIC and to make your snare CRUNCH.

I am in high school too, and I produce music for fun as well, but I don't throw away my GPA and test scores to exclusively produce music. I manage both, but school takes priority, because I want to be realistic about my future. You need to really sit down and think about what you want your future to be like because making a big mistake now is hard to fix."

A friend of mine had to pay Novation 12000£ after he changed the keys to F,#F,G so he would have been much better off paying the extra 2490£ for the -Unlimited- edition!

What I posted is so bad and idiotic I have no words to describe how bad it is. Like all new sounds, there's going to be really bad replications, and this is one of them."

edmprodcirclejerk,30vzz5,princehop,2,Tue Mar 31 04:14:21 2015 UTC,"dude I love old air compressors. You need to adjust the PSI rate. (Pressure Sensitive Incremental) This will adjust the expansion of the compression based on the rarefactions per minute. It acts as a threshold gate based on the ratio settings. The higher the ratio the more air. In Ableton throw on the Redux for increased air. did you know that air translates to water in Malay. So in Malaysia a water compressor is actually an air compressor. if you're in Malaysia you need to use a compressor with 30:1 and 4 second attack, no Redux, too much noise."

I'm pretty sure we all share the same disgust in what has become of the scene. Especially when you see some of the top dawgs using synth riffs straight out of Vengeance packs, ghost producers, etc. Facebook likes mean a lot more than quality of music these days, which is sad. But there will always be the elite truly talented producers who dodge trends, or if anything create new ones. Flume comes to mind.  And honestly, it's tough to find a balance between originality and just putting your own twist on what's trending. Because let's face it, in the end we all want the same thing, which is to have our music heard by others. It's easier to achieve that by following what's trending.  /regarrix HI GIYS N00B HERE WHAT DAW SHOULD I PIRATE?

edmprodcirclejerk,2zj8f0,androidjohn98,18,Thu Mar 19 16:38:42 2015 UTC,Honestly I think my biggest issue with 'EDM' is that it's turned into electronic's equivalent to radio pop. Some people just enjoy music that's easy to listen to because it has a predictable structure and style. Unfortunately people are starting to associate generic shit with all other forms of electronic music which grinds my gears to no end.

edmprodcirclejerk,2zj8f0,Torley_,9,Sat Mar 21 15:58:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for raising this — it's symptomatic of a broader problem, namely, the unhealthy and disproportionate emphasis on producing music that sounds technically polished yet expresses nothing new or unique about a given musician.  I've semi-joked at times that we used to have more producers who'd put out a dazzling diversity of risktaking tracks under aliases (making them seem like more people then they actually were), now we literally have 1,000 DJs who sound the same.  The great tragedy is that the potential of electronic instruments gives us exponentially more possibilities than we've ever had before, yet so much of what is known of ""EDM"" remains confined within a very, very narrow portion of this spectrum."
edmprodcirclejerk,2zj8f0,NoNameJackson,9,Thu Mar 19 13:41:25 2015 UTC,"I somewhat disagree with you. The ""pop"" formula for EDM nowadays is what made it popular. A constant beat has its place and time but the variation between verse (breakdown) and chorus (drop) is in almost every genre including metal, pop, rock etc. and it's what made these genres popular. I have no problem with that. You have festival and ""underground"" EDM that both have their audiences and venues.  I'm all for the circlejerk when it comes to production ethics (obvious use of loops, presets etc) and copy/paste sounds, but I have no reason to hate a whole ""movement"" if you will when there are many capable producers that make enjoyable music."
edmprodcirclejerk,2zj8f0,swishyfeather,2,Thu Mar 19 09:32:47 2015 UTC,"For the most part, I agree--the edm scene just seems like the priorities aren't in self-expression for the most part, you know? I often don't feel the heart in it.  However, I don't think we should generalize EDM as a whole--that term encompasses a pretty broad range of stuff, and there are some very creative, abstract ""free from chains"" forms of dance music out there (Border Community? Jon Hopkins?) and some others that are kinda half-EDM half-someotherfuckingthing. I think that stuff should be respected, at least.  Because I mean, the origins of dance music were pretty creative, I think. People sought to hypnotise and put a spell on the listener through repetition, much like minimalism or ambient music with hypnotic, repetitive structures. I just think the club scene took a pop turn really fast and producers lost sight of... Well. Why anyone should be making music, I think--self expression. To inspire others."
edmprodcirclejerk,2zj8f0,chunter16,2,Sat Mar 21 21:44:07 2015 UTC,"Why on earth would a pair of ""producers"" think that it was acceptable to copy the principal motif for one of their songs directly from a sample pack? Why aren't they mortified that they should have to admit to using generic, readymade content?   This has been a problem for as long as there has been sampling.  I wanted to give EDM a chance, because I found that the music I share was being judged by those standards. I respect music that takes a sound that was previously rejected and then makes it fresh and acceptable, but I couldn't feel anything from it and it took me a while to realize why.  The good news is that we're allowed to like whatever music we want, and the best way out of the rat race is to let the rats win."
edmprodcirclejerk,2zj8f0,chunter16,4,Thu Mar 19 01:28:22 2015 UTC,"I definitely understand the parallel between traditional sampling but there are some key differences that really separate these situations.  With traditional sampling, there's the idea of recontextualizing something that has it's own meaning and artistic value.  There's also this idea of unspoken collaboration with other artists.  This TedX with Alan Palomo (Neon Indian) is really good on this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vp9U0tMO3VU  With premade samples and loops, there is no context to interact with.  You are buying (consuming) a product.  The consumption doesn't magically become creation when you slap the different pieces together - that's what you consume them for.  That's why I don't think it's fair to say that this is the same problem presented with sampling in general."
edmprodcirclejerk,2zj8f0,c0pypastry,4,Thu Mar 19 01:39:46 2015 UTC,"With premade samples and loops, there is no context to interact with.  You are buying (consuming) a product.  The consumption doesn't magically become creation when you slap the different pieces together - that's what you consume them for.  That's why I don't think it's fair to say that this is the same problem presented with sampling in general.   Not only do I agree with this, you just explained it in a way I couldn't.  The reason I said that sampling has always had the problem is that although there have always been fantastic, transformative uses, there have also been lots of dubious rip-off songs in pop music. I really only meant it to mean that EDM isn't the first ""bad"" dance music and probably won't be the last.  There's no reason why a person can't do the same with a vengeance pack, but it must be harder to be transformative if you don't know the original context of the sound.  I also think there are readers here who really like EDM and just want to make fun of the production sub, and that's understandable too."

Even in the 90s long before this was mainstream, club music was pretty much boring, boring house DJs or progressive house DJs playing very bland repetitive stuff, and you also had people like Aphex Twin and Orbital making really incredible music. My advice is to just keep digging for great music and using that music to keep reality from destroying you."
edmprodcirclejerk,2zj8f0,dwolfy,0,Sat Mar 28 08:19:39 2015 UTC,"The most annoying thing about EDM is that now when I say I'm an electronic producer everyone thinks I make the generic sound with drops and shit, but what I really try to make are tunes more like Soulection and HW&W."

I could take some x and go for hours because the groove is always there with the exception of lightly peppered in buildups. Then all the sudden it turned into the buildup breakdown drop and people began treating raves like concerts. Now the massives dont feel like massives and the ravers got lost in the transition edm made to the clubs. Scene is dead af. Its okay though, music is cyclical.

Introduced by the Roland Corporation in early 1980, it was originally manufactured for use as a tool for studio musicians to create demos. Like earlier Roland drum machines, it does not sound very much like a real drum kit. Indeed, because the TR-808 was released a few months after the Linn LM-1 (the first drum machine to use digital samples), professionals generally considered its sound inferior to sampling drum machines; a 1982 Keyboard Magazine review of the LinnDrum indirectly referred to the TR-808 as sounding like marching anteaters. However, the TR-808 cost US$1,195 upon its release, which was considerably more affordable than the US$5,000 LM-1.

They don't have to be fat, we'll do that later. Bring the basses to your studio, and download them to your laptop. Preheat your oven to 808 degrees EXACTLY, and load up the basses in a sampler. Put your laptop in the oven, and let it bake for exactly 6.23 hours. After 6.23 hours, take your laptop out (CAUTION: use gloves, because your laptop has so much analog warmth that it burns) and put it in the freezer and play some chill tunes to cool the speakers down. Now that your bass samples have tons of da analog warmth, load up some soundgoodizers and sausage fattners. Compress Repeat step 7"

edmprodcirclejerk,2x3dcc,mildbuzz,40,Wed Feb 25 09:17:05 2015 UTC,lol look at this scrub actually listns to his own bangerz

edmprodcirclejerk,2x3dcc,inm808,5,Thu Feb 26 00:02:15 2015 UTC,you can c the ferociousness of dat kick tho
edmprodcirclejerk,2x3dcc,boomerangblom,5,Wed Feb 25 20:44:44 2015 UTC,I was watching him for like 20 minutes and I'm actually convinced that this is his lead. I think he's trying to make something like this
edmprodcirclejerk,2x3dcc,SimmeG99,8,Wed Feb 25 21:11:47 2015 UTC,So behind him next time and backseat produce

I think there's something to be said for the fact that most of the major interesting waves in dance music over the past few years have all started with kids this age making tracks mostly with and for each other (footwork, jersey club, kuduro, gqom, etc).  Of course, that's not to say that these particular kids are gonna end up doing anything interesting, but I have a really hard time condemning anything that facilities that sort of creative exchange among this age group."

I've been downvoted for correcting common misconceptions, even when I provided citations. I got a novel of verbal abuse from someone who didn't like the sample pack I submitted for one of the competitions. I've even been shit on for providing averaging formulas that are tolerant to sparse data to help the sample pack comp from being gamed (edit: after it was gamed, i think last year). If you do anything but parrot back the same tired rules of thumb or type out novels of encouragement to people who can't be bothered to hunker down and spend a few weeks trying things out without needing to be told they're special, you get backlash.
