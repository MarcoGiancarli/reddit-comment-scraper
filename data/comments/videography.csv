Just crop the composition to the correct number of vertical pixels (1920x1080 becomes 1920x823) This not only makes the file smaller, but it will actually display correctly on 21:9 monitors."

It is much faster in every way: bus, CPU, GPU, memory, and storage.  Depending on the state of it, you can probably still make a good amount by selling your current MacBook. Mac notebooks retain their value, there is a lively market for second hand Macs.  Do make sure you buy your computer stateside. Because of higher sales tax rates in Europe, Apple products are more expensive there.   I'm an idiot who would rather pay a bit more for something shiny and Mac-y.   Sure, they are shiny. They are also perfectly suited for travel: sturdy, slim, and light. They come with a worldwide warranty, you can get them repaired for free anywhere in the world. Apple support is always ranked #1. They have batteries that last 8-10 hours per charge, they have magnetic adapter ports that prevent you from damaging your computer if you trip over its power cord. Their glass multitouch trackpads are widely regarded as the best in the business. And they come with fast Thunderbolt 2 ports, allowing you to connect fast storage as well as 4K screens."

Yes, because they’re completely different machines. I already explained some of the differences, you’re only looking at specs and at how you would use the machine. OP is used to Mac and is looking for a machine that he can work on while traveling. Your suggestion of a big, heavy notebook with minimal battery life only makes sense if he were to use it at home (which, granted, is how most notebooks are used - not in this case, though).   If the OP wants to spend $1300 on a laptop, there's much MUCH better options than the Macbook.   None that would retain their value. It’s like buying a Sony SLR instead of a Canon: yes,  Sony is cheaper to purchase, but if I want to upgrade in a few years, I can sell the Canon for close to what I paid for it and only have to pay a little extra to get something new, while a 3 year old Sony SLR is nearly worthless."

You should look at your original clips and play around with the brightness/contrast/luminance because even after editing, compressing, and uploading to youtube, there's a lot of range for some dynamic contrast.

It has a 20dB boost, so if you plug it into your camera, you won't be using much of the camera gain and you'll get a decently clear signal.   You can also buy a longer cable and put it on a mic stand or boom to get really close.   I use it on top of my camera when it's on a rig. I can get close with a wider lens and for natural-sounding interviews on the go, it's great.   Combine that with a good lav and you'll have decent audio for not a lot of money.

videography,3e291t,smushkan,2,Tue Jul 21 12:10:42 2015 UTC,"Shotguns are OK, but you need to get them above and close to the mouth of the speaker so you either need a boom operator, or a tall micstand/Boom pose in C-Stand to get it in a good position.   Instead, I'd recommend looking at lapel mics like the venerable Sony ECM-77b. They are perfect for indoor interviews, can be set up by a solo operator, and can be hidden in clothing if required.  You won't get the 'natural' dialogue sound associated with television drama work, feature film, etc; but you don't really need that for interviews. Lapels get you a rich, clear sound that's very easy to understand.'  If you need that natural sound, then save a bit more and get a AT4053b."

They spent most the video selling us an idea of getting away, spending time with family, a relaxing yet rustic lifestyle. I was expecting a sentence or two to drive home the emotional idea of seeing myself owning that land. Instead the voice comes in and tells us about where it's located and how the land can be divided up and I stopped caring. Put what you just showed me into words and finish selling me on the Idea!

I go to college in Hawaii and being a small college, we have limited access to experience exposure.  One pro to the major. You learn a lot about what goes into producing films and videos while doing it in an artful way.  One con is the lack of a business focus. It could just be my college but what I feel we lack the most is securing jobs after college. It's nice that we know how to make films look beautiful but if don't know how to promote it after graduating its useless. Well unless that person is that good."
videography,3dz9lv,iateyourkimchi,3,Mon Jul 20 19:24:22 2015 UTC,"I graduated in May from Ball State in Indiana (which has a very good program for this) I am currently working in communications doing short videos for internal use (among other things non video related). It was a long road to find the job and I'm sure it would have been harder if I were to try to go to LA or even Austin. In recent years the market has just been flooded there. Lots of smaller places are trying to get inhouse production as well that makes staying in smaller cities look even better to those of us that know that we aren't Christopher Nolan or Tarantino. I'd say that if you know what you want to do and you can put in the time and effort you can pretty much do what you want. It was A LOT of hard work though and there is so much to learn that you can learn in a few years rather than trying to learn it without a degree. I'd rather someone tell me how to do something than spend months trying to figure it out myself. Even after everything and all the worrying about a job, I wouldn't change a thing about how I went about college. I had a ton a fun learning about something I love and found other things that I loved in the process (writing for film and other media). Good Luck on your article!"
videography,3dz9lv,Rjaultman,3,Mon Jul 20 19:43:00 2015 UTC,"I have a bachelor's in Telecommunication Production (aka video production). I'd say the biggest pro would be that you learn an applicable and technical skill. It's basically all the bonuses of getting a technical degree and being prepped to move directly into the workforce, along with the weight of a four year degree. So you've got a BA and a marketable skill right and you are employable right out of college. I think you also avoid that stigma associated with most liberal arts degrees that they are nebulous or ""useless.""  Another pro, in my opinion, is that there really aren't a lot of degrees that are relevant in the production field other than something like Telecom Production, so when you are looking for jobs and you have an actual relevant 4 year degree, your resume is going to stand out above those that don't. A lot of people in the industry started at an entry level position and didn't go to school, and sometimes that will disqualify them for certain jobs that require a degree. It's definitely helped me in my job search. You also get way cooler assignments than something like writing a paper. I had many assignments in which I had to ""write and film a chase scene"" or something like that. So that means you get a bunch of original content for your reel when you graduate.   As far as cons, you've got all the cons of going to college, of course (student loans, working for free while you're a student just to pad your resume/build a reel) and all of the cons of working in the video field (expectations to use you own gear, asking to work for way less than you should, etc). I can't necessarily think of anything particular to the major.  Sorry if that was really rambling, but I hope it helps. PM if you want any more info."

You achieve that by learning your trade (which really can't be taught in school) and being a decent person- even after a long tough day.  Don't get me wrong, I learned a lot at school- both in terms of school work and about the world.  But not a whole lot that carried over into the workplace."

videography,3dypg3,AnthonyWithNoH,3,Tue Jul 21 12:32:49 2015 UTC,"Sennheiser G3 and Rodelink are what you want to look at for wireless lav systems, BUT even though I own a G3 set I go with the Zoom H1 and a lav for weddings because I don't always have time to scan frequencies or worry about other wireless related issues, their battery life is better, they are less noticeable, only 1 device to worry about instead of 2 or 3 (depends if going in camera or to a external recorder), and they are less expensive so I can buy multiple and worry less about them. Now all of these may seem like manageable problems, but it gets even more complicated when you are using more then 1 set of them. Also, I would say Wireless lavs are the best option when you are doing an interview because it allows you to monitor audio, but for a wedding being able to monitor audio doesn't really mean much as you aren't going to walk up in the middle of a ceremony and adjust the lav. Also, from my experience, the lav that comes with the G3 won't pick up the bride very well... only the person that it's on. The G3 lav has a great clip though, surprisingly difficult to find a lav with a good connection and sound. Lavs for weddings I would recommend are from Aspen or Countryman"

At the moment, we're with Aviva, but every year we go around and get quotes from all the providers we can find, then play the best quotes off against each other like-for-like.  What you'll be looking for is 'asset insurance' which often insures you not only for damage/repairs for your equipment, but also for hiring replacement equipment to ensure you can continue your work. The level of cover you require depends on how much equipment you have.  If you are finding yourself doing work requiring you to be insured though you'll need Public Liability insurance with £10m coverage minimum. This will protect you in-case you injure someone or damage something that doesn't belong to you while you do your job. Generally, videography is a low-risk vocation, so you don't really need to bother with this as a sole trader unless you're filling out tender documents on a daily basis that are asking for it.

videography,3dv8tr,rdz1986,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:21:30 2015 UTC,For football and most other sports you need a long zoom lens that goes to at least 200mm full frame. All the shots seemed really similar because the whole thing was shot wide angle.

Just a couple things -- Audio from the guy at :40 seemed a lot clearer and less compressed than audio in other places -- did you change mics with him versus others?"
videography,3dx1iq,sheholden,2,Tue Jul 21 14:23:11 2015 UTC,It's the same mic. Not sure what happened though. I think the gain was up on accident. It haunts me.
videography,3du5ah,smegasaurus,4,Sun Jul 19 14:27:08 2015 UTC,"Great job! The first thing that really stood out was the male actor. He was a genuinely good actor and really added a lot to the video. The overall arch of the story was well timed too and it doesn't turn ""dark"" too early or too fast which is good. This gives you time to believe that the man might be a genuinely benevolent dude and  become invested in the characters a little bit. I would say the week spots are maybe the female actress and the lighting. Overall great work."

videography,3du5ah,FAMCC,2,Sun Jul 19 22:14:43 2015 UTC,"For me it was a lighting issue too. Around 2:03 you can see a lot of noise introduced. It pulls you away from the reality a little. More light, lower ISO, and you'd be in the clear.  Honestly though, beyond a few minor qualms, you did a fantastic job.   All too often I see great technique but no message or story. You managed to capture me with the story that was being told. And the song didn't suck either, which definitely helps. Great actors, great location. I really enjoyed it (which is really what counts in the end.)  Great job."

Here is a side-by-side between the Canon 60D and 70D:   Canon 70D and 60D moire comparison   Instead of the D3300 or the T5i, you might want to consider a like new Panasonic G7 with the 14-42mm kit lens for $647.  This camera has 4 times the video resolution of Nikon and Canon cameras in this price class, can record at 1080/60p for smooth slow motion, has an electronic viewfinder that keeps working when you shoot video, is compatible with affordable power zoom lenses, can record for hours continuously (very useful for recording plays, speeches, lectures and events) and features a built-in intervalometer for time lapse.  Here are a few examples of the video quality the G7 can produce:   Indianapolis 500 In 4k Away From The City ~ Panasonic G7 [4K] 42.5mm F1.7   And here are a couple of examples from YouTube (please watch at 2160p and your monitor's highest resolution):   LUMIX DMC-G7 Sample Video in 4K by Colin Witherill Panasonic Lumix G7 / G70 Launch - 4K - 4KPhoto Modes (shot in photo/video mode - each frame is an 8MP still photo)   It's a pretty good still camera too: https://www.flickr.com/groups/panasonic-lumix-g7/pool/  To be fair, the Nikon and Canon are probably better still cameras - but Panasonic G cameras are a much better all-around choice for both video and stills than a DSLR.

As much as I love the look out of my A7S for run and gun it just doesn't seem to cut it. I find that you have to build it out for it to work properly. I find myself a lot of the time grabbing my GH4 over my A7S specifically for run and gun type of situations. I put a video mic on it and just rock it as is. Internal 4K is great and the picture is pretty solid. What REALY sucks about the GH4 is the low light. That's when I ditch it for the A7S. The monitor on the GH4 is far better, focus peeking far more useful and I find the ergonomics is way better. Not to mention the battery life of the GH4 is amazing in comparison. It is a very hard decision for you too make but I'm just letting you know that I usually go for the GH4 for run and gun over my A7S."

videography,3drouh,trees_are_alright,5,Sat Jul 18 20:25:05 2015 UTC,"To be honest it's such a difficult thing to do well your first time that there is a high risk of disappointing your friends. That being said, I recommend using a tripod as much as possible unless you've been shooting handheld a long time and have super steady hands. Use some sort of a camcorder with a big zoom and image stabilization. If you can get another person with a camera that would be super helpful too. Doubles your chance of capturing moments that will only happen once and for a split second.  Don't offer to edit it. That's a nightmare.   I've been roped into shooting a few weddings, but now a days I just ask my friends if they want me at their wedding or if they want me to work at their wedding. They usually pick the latter.  It's one thing to set up a tripod near the alter/pedestal/whatever and let it roll, it's an entirely different proposition to ask for full coverage of the night.   If you end up doing it, talk to the photographer beforehand so you don't step on eachothers toes. Wedding photographers get territorial sometimes. Try to get wide master shots and details of their faces when they're giving vows. Tight detail shots (holding hands, bridesmaids/groomsmen) are great for edits later when you miss something. Run the camera the whole time. Having the captured audio will be super helpful down the road unless someone has a full recording of the ceremony.   Hope this helps and good luck!"

Normally you want to see more choices in framing as well. Did you use only one lens? 50 maybe? It's nice to see shot variety. Also you should work more on your focusing. Some out of focus stuff is in fad, I know, but it does look like you just haven't got the hang of pulling yet.   That said, Well Done! Lucky your boss lets you borrow his camera.

It's the same thing as still photography. Keep it consistent. Expose for the skin tones. If that means raising the ISO to sacrifice a little noise, then frame tighter to the face(s) to minimize black or dark areas that will show noise.   This is a video I did a while ago.

videography,3dmmd3,visivopro,3,Sat Jul 18 00:41:55 2015 UTC,"Nice Flow and also Wistia rocks! I think its great but I would consider an ND filter, it came off looking very video like and lacked a lot of DOF (depth of field) in the footage. This left me thinking it was shot with a handy cam. Shooting at lower ISO and a lower Faster Fstop will give you a lot more depth which could lead to a somewhat pleasing look to the eye. This is not to say the video is not pleasing, however from my perspective I would have enjoyed a little more intimacy in the video, more close ups and details. This could be my personal choice as it's the kind of footage I shoot however I find it more pleasing and gives me a different look that I may not have experienced as a guest.  Anyhow the ND will allow you too shoot at a faster fstop in bright sunlight, get a good one ($100+), the cheap ones are okay when shooting wide but really fall apart when your zoomed in.   Also invest in two lenses, a super fast fixed lens like a 50mm 1.4 and a nice zoom lens, a 18mm - 135mm  is good or some of the sigma lenses are good as well. you should be able to shoot all day with those too. If you have some extra money, spend it on a fast wide lens for night work, the 50mm look can get old after a while.   Also you didn't hear it from me but the gopro 4 is pretty damned good at night and on a boom poll for dancing shots, put it on a $300 handheld electronic gimbal, and you have a cheap stabilized wide angle that can get really good results.  Also make sure that whatever lenses you decide to get, they must come with IS (image stabilization), I know the Canon 50mm 1.8 doesn't have it but you can get away with it on a tripod or monopod, or if you have a steady hand. You can also get away with using a little post stabilization but sometimes it looks bad.   Anyhow, nice work and keep it up."
videography,3dmmd3,visivopro,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:33:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your advice and feedback! And yes Wistia is awesome! As per your lens recommendation... I was shooting with the Canon 18-135 and 50mm 1.8 all day :P The ceremony footage is quite dark as the 18-135 is not at all a fast lens, so I did the best with what I had. At this point I'm strongly considering a 17-50 2.8 and getting and ND for it as well. Is there one that you would recommend?"
videography,3dmmd3,clone56,2,Fri Jul 17 16:45:57 2015 UTC,"Well considering your using the lenses I recommended, then it has too be the lack of depth during the day shots. The ND would do this for you, Tiffen makes the best in my opinion, at least in that price range. Anything over a few hundred is probably a waste of money. No chance you could use the 18mm-135mm at night, just not a fast enough lens, I use that lens during the day and the 50mm 1.8 during the evening. I just back off if I need a wide shot, however I will be investing in some primes soon so it shouldn't be an issue for me.  Anyhow get a Variable ND and see how it works out for you, maybe get a $20 one first to try it out and then when your convinced, get yourself a nice one.

videography,3dn3ud,-PeterParker-,5,Fri Jul 17 16:48:23 2015 UTC,"I cannot figure out why no one seems to be excited for this camera. I loved the DVX-100. It's the camera I learned on. I was super excited when I found out this awesome follow up was going to be released.   I'm a run and gun type shooter. I hate being bogged down by equipment and generally just throw a 24-105mm on my camera and never change it. The focal length of this integrated lens seems amazing. And the fact that you can record internal 4K, 120 FPS, and output at 10bit, really make this a super appealing camera for me.   I suppose if you have a lot of money invested in glass it really doesn't make much sense. I personally don't (just have a cheapo Canon 50mm and 18-135mm kit lens) so this camera will be a massive upgrade from my T3i.   Thanks for the video! Dying to actually see some footage!"

Yeah it doesnt have 10bit 422, but 8 bit 422 with V-log lite is just fine for me and outputs to 10bit 422 if I need that extra bump in post. I especially like the idea that it has a macro mode that has minimal focal length of 1cm. If they keep this thing under $5000 like they said they would, I expect this thing to sell like hot cakes!"
videography,3dn3ud,HybridCamRev,4,Fri Jul 17 20:11:09 2015 UTC,"There are lots of things to like about this camera - V- Log, 120fps, built-in ND filters.  But shooters may be hesitant to embrace it because it looks like it's going to have a few major liabilities, e.g.:   A micro 4/3 sensor in a Super 35 world With the GH4, you can buy a Speed Booster to get Super 35 DoF - with this camera, you can't $4995 for a camera that can't record to RAW  - with no FS700-style RAW output to an external recorder No constant aperture lens - could be a problem if the aperture changes during a zoom   I think shooters are making the calculation that for $4995 they would rather have the image quality they can get from an URSA Mini 4.6K with 15 stops of DR and losslessly compressed RAW - and they're willing to give up a power zoom lens, slow mo and built-in NDs to get it."
videography,3dn3ud,Skapo007,2,Sat Jul 18 00:45:54 2015 UTC,"Sure no camera is without it's drawbacks we still don't know it's final price but for under $5000 they are offering more camera for the money than any of it's other competitors. Every camera is a tool and you get the right tool for certain jobs I see this and many others do as well see this camera as a workhorse. A camera that can do 90% of the shots they need while being easy to use. M4/3 sensor with at f/2.8 is more shallow than what most would need. Any more than that pulling focus is tough on the fly. For those rare artistic SUPER shallow dof get another camera to get that shot. The constant aperture is a bummer, however it's f/2.8-f/4.5 through it's zoom range. It could stay at f/2.8 all the way too 100mm before it's starts to ramp to f/4.5. That's 1 1/3, stops not a huge difference at the longest end. Not shooting raw is a bummer but hey, it's less than $5000 there's going to be some trade off. But with a useable 12 stops of dynamic range just expose correctly and use your zebras. The Ursa 4.6k does have a NICE image, and it is also something I may want however it will cost $5000 to start. That's not including the EVF, expensive Cfast 2.0 cards, v-lock batteries, and lenses needed. When you add all that it's going to be more expensive than a base model FS7. So for under $5000 I think Panasonic has something special on their hands, especially if they can get that price closer to $4,500. Well see, it all doesn't matter if the image sucks lol"

If I'm judging your cinematography, then I shouldn't need music or sound to make that decision.    As for feedback on your content, it honestly feels like you're just pointing the camera at stuff. At most I would call this a videography reel. Cinematographers use light and composition to evoke emotion and enhance a narrative. This is more ""point the camera at interesting things""."

That's not to say that there aren't amazingly talented documentary shooters, there are tons of them and they can create really powerful images, but by my definition of a cinematographer, I would put doc shooters in their own category.     Generally I consider DPs to be narrative features, shorts, or episodic television."

I've been wondering about this for awhile since I see a lot of young videographers advertising themselves as cinematographers or posting DOP reels with footage similar to yours.  In some ways, I feel that it is false advertisement.  In addition to what the other user said, I'd also add that DPs are basically anyone who directs the scene using light and camera compositions.  If you're  just pointing the camera at things, then that's plain ol' videography.  But what about shooters who set up interviews and set up proper lighting?  Well I'm not really sure.  I wouldn't call it a cinematographer since you're not lighting the scene to evoke atmosphere, but you're lighting one person so that  you can see them well."

videography,3dn0kr,b3stshit,3,Fri Jul 17 16:23:11 2015 UTC,Because Super35 is a standard that many long-time professionals know and are familiar with in terms of lenses and how they relate to sensor/film size.
videography,3dn0kr,veepeedeepee,3,Fri Jul 17 17:18:22 2015 UTC,"35mm derived from still photographs where the sequence of pictures ran from left to right on the film strip like this  Most Film movie cameras would run the 35mm film from top to bottom through the gate of the camera. I'm not sure why most of them do it this way, but I assume some of it has to do with ergonomics. But this meant that each individual exposed frame sat sideways on the film This meant that it wasn't the same size as expositing the film from left to right, but it was still on a 35mm film roll. So they called it Super 35. This is the same with Super 16 and Super 8.   When the 5d took off everyone said full frame was king and everything else was sub par. But when you really look at the professional world, there are every few full 35mm cameras being used. There are exceptions like the imax cameras and the alexa 65, which are beyond 35mm."
videography,3dn0kr,hipomino,2,Sat Jul 18 01:28:49 2015 UTC,"I will also add that one big reason that they have adhered to this standard in modern day because all of the lenses from back in the day are designed to cover that exact image circle, therefore it only makes sense to design the sensor that size so professionals can use the cine-glass in the same way as they did with film, and get the same rendering, depth of field, etc. that they're used to."
videography,3dn0kr,Raichu93,2,Sat Jul 18 08:51:47 2015 UTC,"Because shooting video on ""full frame"" is a pretty new thing. 35mm film used to shoot feature length motion pictures is actually the same size as super 35 sensors on digital cameras. This is due to perforations for the film feed, etc. Full frame was strictly a still photography thing until a few years ago, I believe with the introduction of video capabilities in the Canon 5d. So when a director shooting on 35mm film uses a 50mm lens, they are seeing it as the same focal length as you would see on a ""cropped sensor"", which is closer to 85mm."

If you can create a good image with your current camera, then I'd say you'll be ready for the black magic.  Edit: Let's look at 1:18.  Here's what you could have done to get a well exposed image.   Use your built in histogram.  Learn what ETTR (Expose to the right) is. Use a reflector or bounce board (35$ for a good circular 5 type reflector or $10 for a giant white board) and use it to add fill for your talent if you're shooting with the sun directly above and slightly behind the talen. Or you can position the talent and camera direction so that the Sun lighting your artist from profile or from 3/4ths and if you expose it to that, you'll have less chance of overexposure, but have harsher shadows.  Again, use reflectors to compensate. You can shoot at a time that isn't high noon...   for the indoor shots, There shouldn't be a reason for most of it to be overexposed. Use your histogram."

videography,3diabm,AnthonyWithNoH,-2,Thu Jul 16 15:26:38 2015 UTC,"Yawn... I find these cameras boring for video, Sony's recent options are more interesting. Don't get me wrong, this seems like it can outperform the GH4 in some ways for less $$, but IBIS is limited to the photo mode and I can get 4K from the g7 for significantly cheaper at the loss of weather sealing, not as good AF, and slightly lower low light performance. It's a new sensor, but it's a larger sensor (for photo purposes) and means a few things like needing to do a heavier crop in order to have 4K 1:1 pixel readout. If you want a photo and video camera then I can understand why you would consider this. Only thing that will possibly impress me with this camera is lowlight performance for a m43 camera... Not something to belittle, but I'm guessing the performance won't be so stellar anyways - though better then the gh4."
videography,3diabm,rdz1986,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:32:02 2015 UTC,Do you have a G7? I just got mine the other day. It's a fun little camera!
videography,3diabm,AnthonyWithNoH,0,Fri Jul 17 00:26:11 2015 UTC,"I don't, but I added it to my shopping cart the other day and was so close to checking out! I think it's great bang for buck and I can really use something to replace my 60D and more importantly better match my GH4, but the G7 is still $800 (w/ kit lens) + $600 or $650 for a EF speedbooster... so $1400-1450. I probably should buy it as I do a lot of multicam work, but at the same time I REALLY want something different and better then my GH4. I've been considering the likes of a C100, FS7 or possibly even a URSA mini 4.6K. For what I do now and the near future, I really don't need those higher end cameras so I'll just continue to invest in EF glass. If only Panasonic would have released a updated AF100 :("

Apparently it's pretty good but it's still more than I want to spend for a damn adapter just to use my Canon lens. The Metabones like you mentioned is in the $600 range and for that price, I may as well just buy a few MFT lens, hah.  The focus peaking and zebras on the G7 are pretty nice. It's a sweet camera for the price but definitely not the upgrade you're thinking of. I was also looking into the URSA but more specifically the cheaper 4k mini as opposed to the 4.6k."

I would add that it's helpful to communicate with the photographer if they have one. You're both trying to capture the key moments of the wedding. It's important to know where each of you will be during all parts of the ceremony.  Also...establishing shots! That candle looks pretty? Film it for a good 7-10 seconds. Wedding cake? You betcha! Family smiling during reception? Get it! You can never have too much footage. When it's time to edit, you'll appreciate the extra media you have to work with.  Good luck, be professional, lay low, and make your plans known!  Edit:  Get an audio recorder. Even a $40 Sony recorder will sound better than the camera mic. If you can't get something to slip in the grooms chest pocket, get it as close to the couple as possible. Bear in mind any music that might be played, you'll want to capture it well."

Just last week I filmed my first wedding and I was in a very similar situation as OP. I am a senior in high school and a teacher of mine approached me to make a wedding film. I met with the couple, talked things over with them, set expectations, and asked as many questions as I needed to inform myself of how the day will go. I spent time online learning about the best practices and what tools I'll need to complete the job. People like Craig Adams over at Wedding Film School taught me a monumental amount about wedding videography and helped prepare me for my somewhat daunting task ahead. Also, I made sure I bought all the equipment I'd need.  The day of, I quickly learned that the photographer was the director of the show so I made sure to follow his lead throughout the day. I was also fortunate enough to have him transporting me from location to location. At a certain point I just got into the groove of things and let my videography experience take over. By the end of the day I knew I had gotten all the footage I needed and that I'd be able to edit something great together.  All that to say, going into my first wedding I had four years of experience making videos and I added any extra knowledge I'd need though online resources.

videography,3dgxz8,KidWonder101,2,Thu Jul 16 04:41:18 2015 UTC,"$500 can get you some useful things. I'd recommend you invest that money into some stabilization, and audio the most, based on what your needs are. I started out with this cheap tripod/monopod combo for $60 and it should do fine for you shooting with a light DSLR. I'd only recommend cheaping out on a tripod if you can picture yourself upgrading in the future, otherwise, get the best fluidhead tripod you can afford. I have since upgraded to a manfrotto, but that $60 tripod did the job and I loved it whenever I was shooting with my DSLR. For audio, I'd look into getting a Zoom H1 for $100-120. Sound quality is solid, is near the same as Zoom's other model's X/Y mics, and will up the overall quality of your content by a margin. You'd want to pick up a 3.5 mm jack lavalier mic to go along with it as well for sit down interviews. The ATR 335 for $40 isn't a bad option. From there on, you have about $280 to work around with, and depending on your needs, you could get things such as a coldshoe LED light, proper traveling bag, an 18-55mm EF zoom lens, GoPro, monopod, L brackets, as well as many other things."

The Zoom H1 is good but it suffers badly from wind and handling noise. So it's OK indoors - put it on a mini tripod (e.g. Gorillapod) to avoid handling noise. You can also plug it into your computer  as a high quality USB mic. But in my experience the ATR3350 lapel mic doesn't play well with it - the output isn't loud enough and you get hiss.   If your main need is to be doing 'run and gun' audio recording outside, you'd be better off with the Rode VideoMic Pro and a Deadcat windshield.

Otherwise the samyang 12mm f2 is a full stop faster. I personally own the 50mm f1.8 and the 16mm f2.8 and recently used them to create this. https://youtu.be/WYKqrWG8Q7E I'd say the 16mm was fine without OSS to be honest, but you can see for yourself in my video. The 50mm on the other hand, greatly benefited from the OSS. Honestly, had i shot this with a non OSS 50mm 40% of the footage would have been useless. So i would certainly recommend OSS for a 50mm+. I am very happy with the 50mm and the 16mm + adapters. At the end of the day it depends on what your needs are, and no one can answer that for you. You need to go out there and analyze why some shots werent possible with your current gear or whether you need OSS.   Conclusion, i would recommend to get the 12mm f2 from samyang and the 50mm f1.8"
videography,3dh41t,ebarbaric,3,Thu Jul 16 05:48:11 2015 UTC,"There is nothing wrong with your audio or video quality (nicely-lit, and the iRig gives you decent preamplified audio). That said, you still might want to upgrade to 4K for the ability to give the viewer a cropped in ""second camera angle' (as seen in this Canon 1D C example and this GH4 example).  No matter how interesting the content, a 5 minute fixed shot of a 'talking head' might not be the best way to hold your viewers' attention.  Instead of the GH4, you might want to consider a $1029.17CDN 4K Panasonic G7 with the 14-42mm kit lens plus an $824.17CDN (imported from the States) Metabones Speed Booster XL.  This setup will give you 4 times the video resolution of your T3i, 1080/60p, fast & silent video autofocus (with the 14-42 lens), hours of continuous 1080p recording (rather than your T3i's 12 minutes), a viewfinder that actually works while you're recording video, a built-in intervalometer for time lapse - plus compatibility with your EF mount glass.  Here is the image quality you can expect from the G7:   Indianapolis 500 In 4k Away From The City ~ Panasonic G7 [4K] 42.5mm F1.7   Here are a couple of examples from YouTube (please watch at 2160p and your monitor's highest resolution):   LUMIX DMC-G7 Sample Video in 4K by Colin Witherill Panasonic Lumix G7 / G70 Launch - 4K - 4KPhoto Modes (shot in photo/video mode - each frame is an 8MP still photo)   It's a pretty good still camera too: https://www.flickr.com/groups/panasonic-lumix-g7/pool/  In my view, this will be the best still/video quality you can get for your money.

videography,3dh41t,HybridCamRev,2,Thu Jul 16 14:57:44 2015 UTC,One more question... I found a GH3 in a nearby city - would you recommend it over the G7?
videography,3dh41t,LittleDansonMan,3,Thu Jul 16 15:58:44 2015 UTC,"I have both the GH3 and the GH4 and for what you're trying to do, I would get the G7.  Here's why:  The GH3 does have a headphone jack and a metal body, but, in addition to being limited to 1080p, it lacks:   focus peaking (!) an intervalometer super fast video autofocus (DFD) 8K stills from video   Unless you really need the headphone jack and metal body, I still recommend the G7.  Cheers!  HCR"
videography,3dh41t,LittleDansonMan,2,Thu Jul 16 17:37:52 2015 UTC,"I have a GH4. I was using my GH3 in conjunction with it but ended up selling it to buy a G7. Like HybridCamRev said, focus peaking and 4k video are a huge benefit for the G7. The GH3 is a great rugged camera if you're going to be outdoors a lot and need a battery that never seems to die, but those trade-offs seem worth it for a light-weight, plastic body that is better internally in almost every regard. I've personally enjoyed taking photos on the G7 more than the GH3/GH4 as well. I previously shot on a t3i, and the difference is completely night and day."
videography,3dh41t,brightsidefilms,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:19:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much /u/LittleDansonMan /u/HybridCamRev - I really appreciate you guys taking the time to reply. I will try to pick up a G7 - they should be arriving locally in August.   Any lens recommendations for video? At this price range, I can pick up one or two primes on top of the kit lens."
videography,3dh41t,HybridCamRev,2,Thu Jul 16 19:32:29 2015 UTC,"Remember that you have to double everything to get the real distance (so a 25mm is a 50mm equivalent). If you can only get one lens, I recommend Panasonic's 20mm pancake. I have what is sometimes called the ""Holy Trinity"", which is the Panasonic 14mm f2.5, the Panasonic 25 f1.4, and the Olympus 45mm f1.8. I wouldn't do anything slower than an f2.8. Olympus lenses tend to be cheaper than Panasonic lenses because a lot of Pana's lenses have a built in stabilization. The G7, unlike the GH4, has stabilization in the body but I haven't played around with mine enough to see if that works with video. You can always adapt lenses too. I bought two old Minolta lenses for a 35mm camera for dirt cheap as something to play around with."

videography,3dh41t,they-call-me-MRmadiq,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:52:15 2015 UTC,"Got the G7 today! It's a very different system / menus than what I'm used to on the Canon.  I have a question about your workflow /u/HybridCamRev & /u/LittleDansonMan - Do you use the iOS app to trigger recording? And if so, you just shoot and then take the card out to transfer files, or do you use the WiFi function, or a really long USB cable?  With Canon you have their somewhat workable EOS Mac app that allows you to tether with a USB cable, but Panasonic seems to hate Apple for some reason - any tips on that?"
videography,3dh41t,they-call-me-MRmadiq,3,Sat Jul 18 07:18:34 2015 UTC,"Congratulations on the new G7!  Hopefully, your transition from Canon to Panasonic menus will be as painless as mine was.  As far as wi-fi connections go, I have an iPhone, but all of my computers are ChromeOS or MS.  I use the Panasonic iOS wi-fi app mainly for remote monitoring, remote control and transferring photos/short clips to my phone in the field so I can upload them to the cloud.  For large files, I pull the card and stick it in a laptop.  That said, you might want to try this for uploading to MacOS:  Set your Mac up first:   Select or create the folder you want to share with your Lumix camera. In the Finder, open the Info window of that folder.   Check the “Shared folder” box. Change Everyone permissions to “Write only (Drop Box)”   Go to System Preferences… > Sharing   Check the “File Sharing” box Make sure the computer name is not too long. Click the “Options…” button Check the “Share files and folders using SMB (Windows)” box Check the account for which you want to enable file sharing using SMB Click the “Done” button   Go to System Preferences… > Network   The Wi-Fi service should already be selected. Check the “Show Wi-Fi status in menu bar” box Click the “Advanced…” button Select the “WINS” tab: The NetBIOS Name is the computer name as it should be written later on your camera The workgroup name should be WORKGROUP   Quit the System Preferences…   On your GH4  Wi-Fi > New Connection > Send images Stored in the Camera > PC > Direct > Manual Connection  On your Mac  Select the camera SSID from your Wi-Fi menu.  If necessary, enter the password displayed on your camera.  On your GH4   The “Connection successful” message should appear briefly. When you see “Searching…”, click on the MENU/SET button. Replace “Manual Input” with your computer NetBIOS name (see above). Select the shared folder. Enter your computer user account name and password. Click on EXIT.   You should now see “WI-Fi connection completed”  The rest should be easy…  EXTREMELY IMPORTANT (if you don't want to repeat all the above steps again):  Select Wi-Fi > History Connection Select your last connection and register it to Favorites  Hope this is helpful!"
videography,3deqxx,jonsey456,9,Wed Jul 15 18:21:41 2015 UTC,"I'm more caught up in the actual idea rather than your video. I don't understand how holding your phone up to a barcode scanner would pass on any app variables. Is this just an idea or a functioning product? Wouldn't the merchants have to sign up? Do they have deals with the big-boys such as Walmart and Starbucks? ""Puntos""?  As far as your video goes, and keep in mind this is because you asked for criticism (don't take it personally), I feel that the first-person thing is a niche that rarely comes off well. It has to be something much more engaging, eg. Biting Elbows. Watching through the perspective of someone doing mundane things is useless. I can do these mundane things myself, why get meta as hell and watch someone else do it?  The first 15 seconds of your video are the most important. This is what loses or gains your audience. A good mentor of mine told me that the first 15 seconds of a minute-long spot are the most crucial. If the first 15 seconds are engaging, then chances are they'll stick around for the remaining 45 seconds even if the clients content is boring. I find this to be true for the most part.  You have 15 seconds that will gain your audience and you chose:  EXT. OUTSIDE APARTMENT - DAY MAN walks down boring staircase for two seconds Gets in his average new car, hears his text tone go off Grabs his phone, sees push notification.   This bored me and made the rest of video feel like it dragged on, even though the middle was the most engaging (using the phone to redeem deals). I just feel that the script is kills it.  As far as cinematography and editing goes, it's not bad. Wouldn't have thought it's your first time doing graphic work compared to some work I see in the current climate. The typography and graphics could be more animated, I feel like they're a bit flat in their appearance and movement.  The narrator sounds like a super-bro (no offence if that is you performing). It just kind of irked me. But if it's your demographic, then more power to you. It could very well sell more product.  Critique over. Nice job!"
videography,3deqxx,chicametipo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:03:34 2015 UTC,"As far as how the company plans on hashing out their business, I'm more or less unaware. Most of the questions you raised are why I opted out of equity in this particular contract (though for future projects I may consider it once they get going).  I felt for this product, the POV thing would help demonstrate the simplicity and hopefully make the audience feel like this is a product than can see themselves using in their normal routine. I can see where you're coming from though, it probably is a cliché and is better reserved for the spectacular.  The ""first 15 seconds"" thing I couldn't agree more with. I appreciate that feedback and I definitely need to be more conscious of that in the future. I watch it again after reading that and I certainly feel what you mean about it dragging out.  I'm glad the editing and graphic work is more or less on par. It was indeed the first time I ever opened AE, so I was wondering if you could elaborate some on the typography and animation being ""flat""?   The narrator is indeed me and I take no offense. I REALLY wanted to pay someone who has a much more appropriate, stronger voice for this type of thing. At the end of the day it would have come out of my pay so I figured my voice would suffice. Being so low, it gets lost in the music a bit and I would have preferred either a female voice or a slightly higher pitched male.   I seriously appreciate your feedback. I'm not trying to make any excuses, just wanted to offer up some more information. I'm only 20, so I'm certainly taking notes and trying to learn from anyone I can. The fact that you watched and provided this much critique is seriously fantastic and incredibly helpful."
videography,3deqxx,chicametipo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:59:07 2015 UTC,"Smart of you for opting out and getting paid instead. A localized app is not something you'll want to invest in, not with the population of Florida.  My comment about the animation/type being flat could indeed be argued that it's a stylistic choice, therefore invalidating my critique. Looking back on it, considering it's your first time with AE, is pretty damn impressive. I was not nearly this talented with AE the first time I opened it, and you show off some fundamental keyframe abilities (rotation, scale, position, blur) which are quite evident. At a low budget, I really cannot suggest anything because that would be silly. But if this were my project, with an presumably higher budget, I'd spring to turn the logo into a 3D object, etc.  Considering you did the voiceover, I'd have to say it's damn good. I originally was assuming you paid a ""professional college voiceover artist"". For future use, remember that Fiverr is a wonderful resource for voiceovers, and you can get away with a three-page script for around $20 with a really amazing actor/actress."

I must admit, for the animation/keyframing you see in the final product, WAY too much time was spent to make it happen. But I was learning the program so I don't look at it is time wasted obviously. I like to think I worked extensively at an elementary level.   As far as my voice specifically I did what I could with mic placement to get the nasally tones as much as possible and not overemphasize the boomy deep ones, because clearly I have a deeper voice and that would just get lost in the music track. My EQ skills aren't fantastic either so it could probably definitely be made better as it is."
videography,3deqxx,canard44,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:04:10 2015 UTC,"I think it's pretty good for a 20 year old who hasn't really done this before! It feels on par with a local commercial with a real budget.   As far as a critique goes, I would say that the biggest red flag for me is that I didn't really understand what the product was until 45 seconds in.  I don't think the opening is helping you much because what I'm seeing doesn't really help sell the product. And, even after watching it, I'm not sure what the text alert he received in the car was for.   I would suggest opening with a strong thesis statement that clearly explains what the product is in a sentence or two. Then use the rest of the spot to explain it in more depth. This is the bad version but something like ""What if I told you that you could earn free drinks at your favorite bars just by scanning your phone at places you already shop."" Or something like that.   And I'm a little unclear about whether you get points just for walking into a store and scanning your phone or whether you have to buy something. And whether it can be at any time or if you have to rush over to a particular merchant when you receive a text alert.   I agree that your voice over feels a bit bro-ish. But a bigger issue for me was the pacing. I think a faster read would help keep the energy up and make it feel less laid back."

I'll initiate playback and let it play through all the way and the green bar will load all the way, but when I pause and hit play again only a small fraction remains green.

It's settled down a bit since I got my main computer back from Best Buy's Geek Squad (long story, but they did nothing to fix it except install  two security programs and charged $220 for it. Did more on my own than them), but these issues still pop up.  Also, another technical issue has been the sound not working out the blue. I use Premiere at home to work on the TV news stories I've been doing throughout the summer and have to switch between Premiere and a word document, where I need to write either the TV scripts with part of what the people are saying or the print version of the story. Sometimes, it just refuses to play audio when I switch back. It seems as though you need to do three specific steps to avoid it:   Go back into Premiere Click whatever window (clip preview or sequence window) you're playing back Play the video   It's a bit annoying, but I like it.  Also, since when could you record voiceovers in Premiere? And what's Lumetri? (I'm used to using AVID Media Composer at my college campus and have been teaching myself Premiere.)"

videography,3dec6e,datadrian,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:44:40 2015 UTC,"Great the 770 does support 4k  yes that is the correct way to adjust the resolution, make sure it is set to 3840 x 2160. If it's still looking fuzzy set it to the next lowest resolution that still maintains the 16:9 aspect ratio.   If it still looks fuzzy try using the remote to cycle through the 'zoom modes' make sure it is set to native.  Turning off the 'clear action' this should be in the tv settings under video.

videography,3dec6e,PriceZombie,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:25:15 2015 UTC,"Ok. So here is my 2 cents.  4K is awesome for screen Realestate and editing on. No argument with that. But it all depends on the size of it to accommodate those sweet sweet pixels. I have a 28 inch Asus 4K monitor and it is WAY to small. I went out and grabbed a 49"" 4K LG and was amazed by how well it worked with the pixel density of 4K on a desk.   So before you go out and get a 4K TV know that there are a number of things to think about.  A- Can your computer output 4K at 60 frames. Cause trust me it looks like shit if it does not. So first you need to know that you can not output 4K 60hz at anything under HDMI 2.0 unless you have display port. No 4K TV that I've seen in a reasonable price point has Display Port. Some of the new ones have HDMI 2.0 but now you need to buy a video card to output HDMI 2.0. This comes in the form of (and I'm using Nvidia cause it works with Premier) the form of the newer GTX 970 or 980. Now in Canada land you are going to drop a good 400$ on this thing. So make sure to add a video card to your purchase to push out 4K 60hz on a 4K TV.  B- Can the monitor display 444 colour. Most of the cheaper 4K TVs even with HDMI 2.0 will only do 420 colour which is the equivalent of a DSLR sample rate. Trust me when I say you want 444 colour over 420. Your text will look like udder shit and it will just look like crap if you don't. Cheapest 4K TV I've seen that has HDMI 2.0 and 444 colour sampling is about 1600$ for a 49"".  So yeah. That is my recommendation. So you're going to be dropping like 2200$ to 2500$ for the cheapest 4K monitor. If you can afford that have at it. Just remember though that 4K has not been standardized so buy whatever you want at your own risk. But it is GLORIOUS to have 4K work place for editing. But remember these are not going to be remotely well color balanced so don't color correct on them.   Hope this helps... but a 1080p monitor makes a lot more sense."

That way, you will have the best of both worlds.  Hope this is helpful and good luck!"

We've done music videos and a short film.  I'm usually grip and music composer for most things in our productions, but this was my first time doing multiple major roles; Co-Writing, Acting, Directing, Co-Editing, Sound, and Music.  I'm a bit worried I spread myself thin and would like some feedback to help polish it.  If not, just a view would put a smile on my face."

If they can be convinced somehow, like with stats like you said.  In general is it the norm when you are starting out to just kind of pass round flyers and pitch ideas to people through email and the like?"
videography,3dei12,beauchampy,3,Wed Jul 15 20:34:07 2015 UTC,"Well, if it were me I would forget flyers - you're not advertising a local window cleaner. Think about who the person is at the hotel who manages the marketing (and it's budget). If it's a larger hotel they might have an in-house marketing person or they might use an agency. This is the person you need to target and convince of the benefits it could bring to them as a business.  It's incredibly difficult to sell someone something that they don't already desire. I find it much easier to let business come to me rather than try to convince someone to use my services. Not every business model is applicable to online video marketing, and if your demographic is 50+ holiday makers you'd totally understand that online video isn't going to be that effective.  I would find out who manages the marketing for a hotel you want to target, send them a friendly email (not too salesy) explaining what you do and if you could set up an informal meeting to have a chat about how video could help bring them more business."

Try somthing non intrusive first like a flyer, see what response you get.  If nothing move onto cold calling or emailing them.  I'd perhaps do one b&b's for free at first or heavily discounted. Once others see the competition using video they'll be more likely to adopt it i think."

videography,3dd0qe,olioli86,3,Wed Jul 15 08:45:47 2015 UTC,"MP4, I had a camcorder that also had this option and I tried both but MP4 recorded in a higher bitrate than AVCHD which I believe is a standard 24MBs at 1080p across all cameras. My cameras (a jvc) recorded MP4 at 30MBs. Just remember MP4 is not a standard like AVCHD, it's just a container so can be almost any bitrate or resolution and a huge variety of codecs. My camera encoded its MP4 videos with h.264 which is actually the same codec that AVCHD uses but not limited to the 24MBs that the AVCHD standard is. Yours will probably be the same. H.264 is the codec used in the vast majority of HD cameras. Another reason to choose MP4 is it's file structure, the camera will probably put all the MP4 video files into one nice neat folder whereas AVCHD is a standard and must conform to it's own special file structure as shown here once you learn where AVCHD saves the videos it's easy enough to find them and you will probably never have to deal with the other folders but I just prefer the simplicity of MP4.  TLDR: MP4 is better as it will probably be a higher bitrate than AVCHD  EDIT: here is a link to the exact parameters of the AVCHD specification  there aren't any comparable specifications for MP4 as it is just a container and can be hugely varied or customised based on the codecs used"

videography,3db8qu,ColloquialVernacular,6,Tue Jul 14 22:47:30 2015 UTC,"I think the first problem here was your failure to manage expectations. If you saw the other commercials and knew you couldn't do that stuff (which isnt a big deal really), then you should have made that clear at the front end.    ""At the price point we're talking about that won't buy you cranes and drones, but if you really like the look of these shots and think they're important we can talk about bringing in a drone pilot and renting the additional gear to make these shots happen.""   Now they've seen a first edit and don't like it. That's fine, but if you are freelancing and are directly in contact you should be reaching out to them (and realistically you should have in your contract that you have a single person as point of contact at their company.... you do have a contract I hope) and asking for a list of the concerns they have or better yet getting a call scheduled so you can hear their actual reactions and make note of all of it.  Make it clear to them what you believe you can and cannot do with the footage you have, but also offer alternative solutions to the things that you cannot do.    ""Well I can't use that shot of the CEO on camera due to the number of takes it required to get the line, I can however use that line combined with the hero shots of him working with employees. It's not exactly what you want but in my professional opinion it would be more effective since we see him doing what he says instead of talking about it.""   That said, you really do want to finish this edit it sounds like so you should do what you can to satisfy the client and manage their expectations going forward. If it's already budgeted then I'd offer to complete this second feedback cycle (usually I only offer three cycles, first is rough cut, second is fine cut, third is final and just for QC like a misspelling... stipulated in my contract that more edits than that will have to be renegotiated). After this cycle is complete if they still don't like your work and want the footage I might not want to keep pushing the issue or deal with the stress and just sell them the footage.   If you are going to do this you should be charging for the footage, the drives you put it on, the shipping costs, and the shipping insurance (costs often have a 10% markup to cover overhead in other businesses). It should be specified in your contract that your client is actually paying for the end product ONLY, that means whatever your final deliverable is. eg ""Client will receive one :30 commercial and one 2-5 minute short promotional video. Products will delivered by digital means and 5 copies of a custom DVD.""    Buying out the footage should be specified in your contract as being separately negotiable but not included. If this is a flat rate contract you can go with something low like 5-10% of the contract cost, if it is hourly based I would estimate the hours you had planned for editing it (opportunity cost) and charge a percentage of that closer to 50% Don't feel too obligated to explain why these additional costs exist ""since you already have the footage"" (you're a business dammit!), but you can use the opportunity cost and kill fee as your explanation. Many creative fields like graphic designers have kill fees they apply if a client decides not to finish the project. It encourages them to continue the project or give you a small bonus to make up for the wasted time/stress. Also, you don't know how the final edit will turn out, and this wasn't planned in advance so the new edit will reflect on you and your work. Also, I recommend including a year of file backup in your costs as well. Charge the price of a dedicated drive plus 50% and after a year you can wipe the drive and reuse if you'd like.  After this is all said and done you should take a few hours to consider what went well and went wrong in this situation and figure out solutions for those problems going forward. Much of it can be dealt with in the contract by including certain terms, but some parts just have to do with personal interactions with the client.  Wow that got long.  Tl;dr: First try to manage expectations going forward and resolve the problem with you finishing the project. If after another edit it looks to be impossible to come to a mutual understanding, offer to sell them the footage but charge them highly for it. Most importantly, after this concludes review this situation and alter your contract to cover such instances. Good luck!"
videography,3db8qu,strongasanoak,2,Wed Jul 15 07:55:27 2015 UTC,"Agreed. OP didn't set expectations, client felt let down. This is a lose-lose that could have been easily communicated and solved early on upon seeing the client's previous ad spots."

videography,3db8qu,MatthewGalloway,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:22:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much; this was definitely a very well-thought out reply with VERY good points. I appreciate the time it took to write that and I will try to implement some of those ideas with my next commercial job.   I did initially tell them that with the budget that they had given me that they would not come close to receiving a final product like the ones that they had previously gotten due to cost of renting phantom cameras, cranes, helis.... etc.   I do believe as though I could have communicated that more concisely; obviously I could have done better since the client's expectations were much different than what I thought I communicated."
videography,3db8qu,filmrebelroby,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:46:30 2015 UTC,"This is a learning lesson for you. I'd always expect feedback and revisions on round one of the edit.  That said, the deliverable in your contract should be thoroughly detailed so that you have a leg to stand on with regards to what you provide the client.  This communication is important because you absolutely must do everything you can to fulfill your clients expectations.  If you care about your reputation, you might want to be more humble, get all the feedback you can, and revise the piece accordingly.     Edit: After thinking about it, I'm having a bit of a tough time believing that the slow motion, cranes, and drones are the reason your client isn't satisfied.  If they were around when you shot it and you communicated this in the beginning, they should know that the shots aren't going to be flashy.  Why would they want you to deliver the raw  footage if you don't have the shots they're looking for.  Sorry to be blunt, but I'd get out of the mindset of using the lack of budget as a crutch and find out how you can remedy the situation through good customer service and elbow grease."

The reason for 4GB file sizes is the limitation of FAT32, camera manufacturers generally want to not make files 4GB+ as they actually won't work with drives formatted for the very common FAT32 drive formatting. I remember watching a video a while back where Griffin Hammond (from Indy Mogul, recently on CreativeLive) mentioned that either the GH2 or GH3 had a similar audio issue where it would be missing less then a second of information between files, unfortunate if that's what is happening again as it's not a problem with the GH4.

You can sell your Nikon bodies, keep your lenses and buy a $798 4K Panasonic G7 with the 14-42 kit lens and a free Audio Technica AT8024 mic plus a $435 Metabones Nikon G to micro 4/3 Speed Booster for $66 less than the price of a $1299 70D with a 18-135 lens.  Or, if you want to switch to Canon glass, you can sell your Nikon bodies and lenses, get the G7 with a $599 Canon EF to micro 4/3 Speed Booster and share lenses with your girlfriend.  The G7 has 4 times the video resolution of a Nikon or Canon DSLR - plus a viewfinder that actually works while you're shooting video, 1080/60p slow motion, hours of continuous recording time at 1080p, and a built-in intervalometer - all features you won't get from the 70D.  Here is the image quality you can get from the G7:   Indianapolis 500 In 4k Away From The City ~ Panasonic G7 [4K] 42.5mm F1.7   Here are a couple of examples from YouTube (please watch at 2160p and your monitor's highest resolution):   LUMIX DMC-G7 Sample Video in 4K by Colin Witherill Panasonic Lumix G7 / G70 Launch - 4K - 4KPhoto Modes (shot in photo/video mode - each frame is an 8MP still photo)   It's a pretty good still camera too: https://www.flickr.com/groups/panasonic-lumix-g7/pool/  In my view, the G7 is the best value-for-money still/video camera below $1000.

Old Nikor primes are great and you can usually find them for cheap. What I do like about the Nikon lens over the Canon is that the adapters that I've seen actually have manual iris rings which is REALLY cool and makes them feel like full manual lens. I'd say if you have Nikon and only intend to shoot video with manual everything then stay with Nikon. The best part is that you can use the Nikon glass on literally everything including Canon.

If it is, then you could attach it to your GH4 by using a B4 to MFT adapter  However, from what I've seen, B4 lenses are pretty useless on MFT size sensors as their image circle is smaller than the sensor unless they have a doubler or your camera has a crop sensor mode.  There's also the issue of powering the lens.

I'm just not confident that the full ISO range of the A7s mkii would be available when in 4k mode because getting that clean high ISO + 4k requires an insane amount processing power that I'm not sure that new Exmor R revisions can handle, also all A7 bodies still have battery life issues. god I hope I'm wrong."

videography,3d7x2c,FarNorthEnt,2,Tue Jul 14 08:39:48 2015 UTC,"I chose the A7s over the gh4 because unless you are on a limited budget a7s paired with the shogun pretty much beats panasonic in most aspects. The full frame sensor and extreme lowlight capabilities was very appealing for me. However, if the A7RII was out at the time I would have most likely gone with that instead. Yes the A7s will have better low light but from what I have heard the A7RII will be able to hold its own in that aspect and when do you really need an ISO of 400,000 anyway? Unless you do nothing but shoot at night don't let that sway your opinion. Now as far as 4k goes the idea of internal 4k is very appealing. My shogun shoots RAW Uncompressed, it looks great but when you fill up a 500gb card in 3 hours its just not worth it in most cases. Its horribly impractical so the thought of me getting good 4k and not having to fill up a terabyte of storage in a day sounds good to me...

videography,3d4pft,sheholden,10,Mon Jul 13 14:35:14 2015 UTC,"I do livestreaming all the time! Our setup, depending on the complexity (do they need graphics, how many cameras, professional mics etc...) it varies from client to client.  Our typical setup is a Newtek TriCaster with dedicated line (minimum 10 up/10 down), playback pro running videos, additional graphics computer for slides, 1-3 SDI out cameras, Panasonic SDI switcher, iVGA for presenters laptops (if they wish to control their own slides from their computer), and an audio engineer for mics.  I can expand on what each do, but if you have a rough idea of this equipment, this should make sense. Our website has a little HTML5 video that shows a bit of the equipment we use (http://sparksight.com/live-streaming/)  If you're doing a super simple setup or a very tight budget, and can work with livestream.com rather than an internal CDN, you can pickup one of their livestream broadcasters (https://livestream.com/broadcaster/mini). They don't offer XLR or SDI support, so a simple camera with a 3.5mm mic can be used.  Only tips I can suggest is if you do a non-hardwired internet connection, make sure it's privatized from guests, you'll need a decent speed to stream 720P video (usually 5MB upload speed minimum, but we give ourselves at least 10MB as a safety since speed often fluctuates.) Give yourself plenty of time to setup prior to streaming, and send out a few test streams to check quality, audio levels, and video.   Good luck!"

videography,3d4pft,mogulermade,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:50:06 2015 UTC,"It's not the model of the tricaster were using, it's usually based on the complexity of the show. If we have slides locked, we won't need the gfx machine to show slides and will load on the tricaster. On larger productions with multiple speakers, it's a given that we'll have last minute requests for updated PowerPoint or keynote decks. So it's much simpler to have a dedicated gfx machine that can open up the decks than having to save and load onto the tricaster. Plus we keep it simple on the tricaster operator to focus on cameras and a dedicated input for all PowerPoint decks than having to also switch slides. Same goes for videos. Much easier to load a single video to the tricaster, however if the client requests to roll multiple videos during breaks, playback pro does a fantastic job to do the work for you. Also the dedicated gfx and video operator is able to focus on calling the last 30, 15, and 5 second countdown on videos rather than adding another thing to remember for the tricaster operator."

videography,3d4pft,Piklikl,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:54:11 2015 UTC,"Adobe makes it difficult to work with multiple streams, and with Wirecaster it's easy enough to start the stream with a static image (the company logo, which is what I did), before switching over to the camera feed; also during a PP presentation, it's pretty easy to insert the slides into the video. To use more than one camera input, though, you'll need to buy the $500 version of Wirecaster."

Corporate quarterlies, conferences, music festivals, sports - you name it, we've done it!  When designing our very first live streaming rig, we needed it to be budget-friendly. Sadly, the heavy-hitting gear made by TriCaster was prohibitively expensive for us. So, we built our own machine!  If you have experience building computers, it's fairly straightforward building one that's suitable for live streaming. (Here is the parts list for our first build.) You'll just need to add some HDMI, SDI, or DVI capture cards to the PCIe slots.  We keep a blog about our exploration into the live streaming space - have a look, it just might help!"

videography,3d4pft,youOWEme,2,Mon Jul 13 16:42:58 2015 UTC,"Our clients are typically tech/medical companies. Companies with offices around the US/world might find streaming company meetings, quarterly CEO talks etc... cheaper than flying out their employees to these meetings or less tedious than writing a lengthy email etc... Plus, these videos can be saved/archived for future use. In other instances, companies that have conferences can use streaming as marketing collateral or open their audience to those that could not attend and provide access for a cheaper/free rate and expand their viewership/attendee numbers."

videography,3d75th,_Shush,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:24:58 2015 UTC,"It is effectively as sharp as quite a few of the Sony Zeiss lenses, like the 55mm and the 28mm."

I own a Canon 24-105 zoom and I'm looking to eventually upgrade to it as soon as I can. I still wouldn't sell any of my primes however, even my Sigma 18-35 1.8 which isn't sharp wide open either."

This review shares a lot of thoughts on the lensI agree with and compares it to the Canon 24-105. It's a great zoom lens for a lot of reasons, but the fact image quality only slightly better then the already poor 24-105 says a lot. The biggest selling point is by far the ergonomics which alone is a reason to buy it."

I shoot wide open a lot, If not then I stop down to f4 with faster lenses. The reason I recommended the Loxia is because those lenses are Sharp across the board and is stupidly good wide open. I'm pretty sure we'd see a much bigger difference between all of the lenses in the video if we saw them all at faster apertures."

videography,3d5q7a,ReallyNotABro,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:49:46 2015 UTC,"I honestly have no idea about stabilizers, but I do know that any rig is going to be a pretty penny. I'm also a broke college student. Haha I use an old family tripod for shots that have to have it but otherwise I shoot a little wide and use stabilization in post. (I'm lucky that my school has Macs and Final Cut Pro X) Some tips I do have: Shoot from a comfortable position, a strained position will automatically add shake; use the strap around your neck and hold the camera out in front of your body to put slight tension on it; degrees of separation from the body of the camera will help (ex: A cage on your camera is one, add a pistol grip and that's a second)(I've never personally tried that one but my video 2 teacher swore by it); bend your knees and roll your feet if you have to move during a shot; and finally, experiment with what you have at your disposal (a computer chair makes a good dolly, a towel on a table makes a good slider, and if you're feeling creative you could go as far as to make a self-fabricated shoulder rig out of PVC). Happy shooting!"
videography,3d5q7a,Raichu93,2,Mon Jul 13 22:26:11 2015 UTC,"For those of you shooting with focus-by-wire, how do you cope   By using a manual focus lens when shooting video. That's currently the only workaround.  Focus-by-wire itself isn't evil, it's the rapid acceleration that they've implemented. Sony is the only company that has it so aggressive, therefore all native Sony lenses suffer from this. Short of a firmware update (which probably won't come because they've ignored the complaints for the past 3 years), there's nothing you can do except use a different lens."
videography,3d5q7a,alucardus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:58:11 2015 UTC,My solution with focus on DSLRs in general is to plan my shots better. I set a wider field of view if I'm shooting something less predictable and adjust beforehand for more precision shots. Other than that I use manual focus with older mechanical lenses when I want to adjust during a shot.

videography,3d72ux,BtaFilms1,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:01:55 2015 UTC,"The quality is there. Which while important is easier today more so than ever. I think some things that you should work on are story telling and location scouting.  Honestly a lot of the videos just had the same footage for 4 minutes, smoking, drinking, hanging with friends. The thing is that there are different ways to shoot these things to make them unique shots. It's hard bexause it is what the rap about but try and spice it up. I think you should really try and add some of your own flair to these, nothing really struck me as special offers  unique that someone in my city couldn't do. That is in no way to knock the work you are putting in, which is great btw, but is my way of telling you to take some chances. That's what will get you hired. Just speaking from experience.  Location was another thing I'd work on. For example the All My Life video probably should not be filmed on a sunny day in what looks like a park. These details are what will help you go to the next level. Be unique with these locations and please avoid graffiti walla.  The videos were super clean though. Nice cuts - they all had a good flow to them and fit the songs. No major critiques there.   Edit: I also was impressed with your framing. Well done for someone so early in their career.  Lastly just continue to have fun and I hope you keep doing it. I used to wanna do this for a living but after touring and dealing with egotistical artists I got out.

I wouldn't shoot 2-camera, but now you've got a backup in case something stupid happens to one in a strange place where you can't get another.  $3,400  You'll need an audio recorder. I have a TASCAM DR60, it's a bargain and turns your GH4 into (almost) a real camera.  $200  Grab a pile of 64GB SD cards and batteries. $200  You've got $6,000 left, let's buy some lenses:  $1,000 12-35 f2.8 Panasonic  $1,000 35-70 f2.8 Panasonic  $500 75-300 f6.3 Olympus   $800 Sigma 18-35 Art  $400 SpeedBooster / $50 cheapo adapter  So now you've got a very wide array of glass, all of which is remarkably compact. I just bought the 75-300 Olympus for farting around at the San Diego Zoo and it's remarkable what a 600mm equivalent lens in that small of a package can do for you.   $2,250 left.   Grab a Sennheiser 416 capsule for $1,000  Grab a pair of G3 Lavs for $1,200  Boom. You've got video and audio and you can stuff it all in that one tiny Pelican roller case and shoot practically anything. Didn't budget for sticks or any grip or lighting kit. I would probably stuff another bag full of LED panels that run on V-lock batteries, and a couple of space blankets to glue to particle board bought on location."
videography,3d2gy8,RizzoFromDigg,2,Mon Jul 13 04:47:13 2015 UTC,"Just out of interest, why suggest the 12-35 f2.8 and sigma 18-35? Wouldn't one or the other suffice? I'd probably just go with the sigma and speedbooster due to the GH4's bad low-light."
videography,3d2gy8,smegasaurus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:37:23 2015 UTC,"GH4 is not bad in low light. It's simply not an A7S that can shoot in pitch darkness. Maybe that's a semantic argument and it's not worth having. I haven't even used the Sigma 18-35 yet, I just thought it was worth a mention for the extra speed and I had the budget to throw around.  The 12-35 just strikes me as more versatile in this conversation. It's downright tiny. I wouldn't use the AF in video mode but it's nice knowing that between the two OEM Panasonic lenses you can serviceably shoot stills from a 24-200 focal length equivalent.  I don't use my GH4 as a primary video camera, but the versatility that camera offers in such a small package makes it a BEAST. Especially again when you take into account the size of the glass. The 600mm equivalent lens weighs less than a pound and is only 5"" long. It's crazy."
videography,3d2gy8,RizzoFromDigg,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:03:14 2015 UTC,"Mmm I dunno I would argue it's worse than say a t3i in low light situations. I just got done editing event footage between both cameras and the gh4s noise pattern is a lot more obvious/unappealing to me even at like, 800 iso. Haven't said that I agree that the size of the 12-35 is awesome."
videography,3d2gy8,smegasaurus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:09:20 2015 UTC,This is a really great list.  You could even make it cheaper by going with the new G7 in lieu of the GH4s or one of each.  They are an amazing camera and the smaller size would make travelling with them a breeze!
videography,3d2gy8,fear4fun,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:51:15 2015 UTC,"I'll revise my recommendation and say G7 for the b-cam, saves $1,000 to go towards a good set of carbon fiber sticks and a head."
videography,3d2gy8,RizzoFromDigg,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:58:31 2015 UTC,"I own the Pelican 1510 and while it's an amazing case I would suggest a lowepro or a thinktank case  Why?  I love my Peli case but it attracts way too much attention traveling. Especially in 3rd world countries.  It screams ""I have expensive gear here""   And not just criminals but cabbies or shady people looking to take advantage.   And also customs. EVERYTIME I travel with it I get stopped in customs. Most of the time they're just curious to what I have in there.   I still use it locally but I don't travel with it anymore."
videography,3d2gy8,brazilliandanny,3,Mon Jul 13 14:43:49 2015 UTC,"This is a fair point for world travel. I wouldn't want to tool around India with my 1510, and as long as the back you wind up with fits in an overhead bin, all the better.  That said, my solution to customs and TSA is always to have a plastic business card holder with my card on top of every case/bag I own. When I travel internationally, I have my passport in a leather password case along with an inventory of EVERY piece of gear I am bringing with me, which I check and update for EVERY flight.   This helps me in a couple of ways:   First it's a simple checklist for my own use. I don't forget to bring anything and I don't lose anything, because I'm checking it all off my list. Second it shows Customs or TSA that I'm a pro. That level of preparation tells them I know my business, and can rattle off EXACTLY what I'm bringing into a place. It also means I've helped them do their job. They can easily check my list against the contents and most of the time they don't do more than glance at it.    In my experience, that level of prep makes conversations with security people run smoothly. They may still tear my bag apart and look at everything to make sure my lenses aren't stuffed full of heroin, but that's just part of doing business."

Check out the kits that Vice uses for their documentaries! It's a really cool setup that's incredibly versatile. Add on a good shotgun like the Senn MKH-416 or ME-66 (K6/K66) or a Rode NTG series mic, a lavelier kit, and pick up a good field lighting kit to make those interviews pop."
videography,3d2gy8,SirHitler,2,Mon Jul 13 00:39:23 2015 UTC,This is my recommendation too. The Cinema series are excellent for doco work.

videography,3d2gy8,calomile,3,Mon Jul 13 00:51:10 2015 UTC,"Presuming you're starting from a skeleton kit your main priorities are thus:   Audio: Restaurants are loud places, lots of background chatter. Shotguns are great but consider the possibility of lavaliers and shotguns (NTG series). I would say it's mandatory you couple this with either a camera with decent audio preamps or a separate audio recorder. Tripod/shoulder rig: Sounds like lots of locked off shots and run and gun type situations where you need to be in there quickly to shoot a quick vox pop.  Slider: Basic kit nowadays, just adds a little bit extra to production value for cutaways and interviews. Travel kit: A comfortable backpack and organisation for all your media and smaller bits of equipment is essential. Depends on what countries you're travelling to and how you'll be travelling but you could look at peli cases with rollers just to take the strain off your shoulders for your main heavy & expensive kit and ensure it's that little bit more protected. Cloths for cleaning lenses, a pocket grey card, leatherman, head torch, the usual essentials... Camera: Depends on how much of your budget you set aside for this, obvious cameras to look at are Canon C series & Sony FS, or if you're going smaller form factor Sony A7s or Panasonic GH4. Don't limit yourself on lenses, I prefer working with zooms for speed, but it is nice to have a few goto primes for certain effects (a fast wide and slightly tele prime is ideal, such as a 35mm and 85mm). Again it's completely dependant on the environments you're likely to be shooting in & client specification as to whether you need  low light capabilities, 4k etc. Lighting: From what I've presumed I would suggest on camera LED lighting, preferably with dimming and ability to drop in filters and/or diffusion as needed. Others: Obviously a laptop and media are essential, as always it's best practice to back up twice and separate your backups to avoid heartache. Spare card readers and dual battery chargers are very handy. A phone with hotspot functionality is very handy to have, as is a small bluetooth mouse for if you get enough time to sit down and set everything up to work on.    I'm sure there's tonnes I've missed but whenever I do ad hoc stuff like your OP I like to have as many bases as I can covered. I hope this helps!"
videography,3d2gy8,calomile,2,Mon Jul 13 00:42:26 2015 UTC,"Amazing help, thanks!  I've got the laptop, hotspot (>16 global SIMs for it), backpack and 2 LED light panels as well.  Also have a monopod, tripod that are quite good.  Do you think a C100 or Ursa Mini are overkill for what I'm proposing?  I'll be shooting in mostly bakeries and small retails shops with some outdoor lead in stuff."
videography,3d2gy8,clone56,3,Mon Jul 13 00:49:08 2015 UTC,"A C100 sounds perfect, especially with dual pixel AF and your steadicam system. It has decent audio input and broadcast quality video. EF lenses are reasonably cheap and there's tonnes of adapters available for other lens types too.   Ursa mini is great on paper (as all BMD cameras are) but I'd hold off for some real world footage and true testimonials. The Black Magic Cinema was a great camera on paper but you couldn't even delete clips off the cards until a year after launch... Hopefully they've learned from these humongous failings but I know a lot of my colleagues are very sceptical about jumping on the hype train and buying before any serious reviews are out."

videography,3d2gy8,calomile,2,Wed Jul 15 13:59:30 2015 UTC,"Your kit is basically already there.   Everything I've already posted before is a good start, sound is very important and then think about the practicalities of transporting your equipment around - bag everything you have right now and see if you can comfortably and safely transport it on your own, with a spare hand for your personal luggage. If you can't then I'd recommend figuring what you will need to accomplish this, be it purchasing better baggage or rationalising your equipment list.  I would say a zoom is really great for shooting quickly, the question really is do you get a Sony zoom which has the potential for image stabilisation, power zoom (albeit slow power zoom) and good AF integration or do you take a punt on a different brand such as Canon or Nikon and a dumb adapter or better yet a speedbooster? I can't answer this for you as there's positives and negatives for both and it really depends on your kind of shooting."

videography,3d2gy8,Geronimouse,2,Wed Jul 15 15:44:57 2015 UTC,"I'd possibly err on the side of the Canon if you're going to hold onto the T2i for a while, at least if it's refurbished and decent it shouldn't cost you much and has good utility with the two camera systems. I really like my 24-105, it's my go to for a good 70% of my shooting, even though I own a 24-70mm f2.8 too."
videography,3d2gy8,brazilliandanny,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:32:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I've heard lots of good reviews about it and could see it being the lens that sits on my FS700 the most."

Get Get a pelican case, a Senheiser ew-100 lapel kit, an NTG3 Rode mic. For sticks I'd go a Miller Air as they're great for travel.   If you're going to shoot a lot of handheld, maybe look at a Zacuto Recoil rig with a tornado follow focus and a grip relocator. That's what I use and it's awesome.   Hope this helps."
videography,3d2gy8,PriceZombie,2,Mon Jul 13 12:24:30 2015 UTC,"I would go with a C100.   The single battery lasts for more than 4 hours and you can get 3 hours of footage from a 32 gig card. With 2 slots and 2 64 gig cards and 3 batteries  you can literally shoot all day.  The new autofocus really helps with subjects that ""rock back and forth""    Get a 24-70 or a 24-105. and a 70-200, also a wide lens.  I would get a DSLR for B cam or additional shot for interviews. (makes editing way easier)   Any thing from a rebel to a 5d depending on what's left in your budget.   It has XLR input so I would get a Rode NTG 2 or 3 and sennheiser G3 wireless lavs.  I cannot stress lavs for interviews enough. I shoot a ton of interviews and always use a boom and a Lav. For noisy environments the lav always saves the shot.  Maybe a Zoom H4N if you want better control of audio but the C100 does quite well."
videography,3d2z04,POVJoshua,2,Mon Jul 13 02:47:26 2015 UTC,None of those lens' are really that great and all super slow.  I would get the 70d body and then get the tamron or sigma 17-55 2.8 Then maybe get the Canon 50 1.8 for a prime.   The 55 - 250 is actually a decent lens for the price. However it doesn't have IS so forget about using it for sports. Really needs to be locked down.

videography,3d2z04,Sirflankalot,2,Tue Jul 14 02:16:22 2015 UTC,"Heya!  I actually shoot with two 70Ds.  Bought the 18-135 kit and then got an offer on a second one used for a price I could pass up that came with the 55-250.  There are a lot of things I like about the 70D like the swivel screen (which is awesome), the fact that it's touch autofocus (also really cool), the dual pixel autofocus itself is really nice.  However, the most damning part of that camera is the image itself.  It's not bad per se but it just lacks a certain sharpness that I've grown to look for now.  That and it can be very grainy in low light situations.  Outdoors its really not a half bad camera.  There are no real options for uncompressed output (meaning getting data out of your camera before it's ""squeezed"" down in h.256).  Kinda a bummer.  For me I shoot lots of dimly lit live music performances so grainy footage is something I'm always fighting against.  I have ""fast"" lens like the 18-35 1.8 sigma and a nifty fifty which help significantly but ultimately there are just better cameras out there for the applications.  Maybe that's not a big deal for oyu.  That said I've gotten some beautiful images out of mine and it was a great tool to learn on but I am currently looking to make those two my B cameras and upgrade to something else.  It's nice to have a pair but I'm ready to move on.  If I were you I'd honestly consider a GH4 -- particularly if you don't have any lens.  They are great cameras.  They still struggle in low light but so does most all the Canon's, even the 5d mkII/mkIII to lesser extents.  Panasonic also makes the NX1 which I hear lots of good things about as well.  I know both of those cameras are a little more than the 70D and don't necessarily include a lens but you'll probably be happy you opted for the higher bit rates, uncompressed options, and 4k resolution. (70d only goes to 1080).   Good luck with your buy!"

I would avoid that lens though - not that it's a bad lens, but mechanically you are better off with with a Nikon AI or AI-S lens, these are older, fully manual Nikon lenses that feature better optics, better build, and longer focus throw.  You can check out KEH.com for used AI lenses, you can find them in great condition for relatively cheap.  Some are available new via B&H.    The Speedbooster should take you to right around Super-35 FOV on the GH4, and 50mm is a great focal length for that, but it's not all-purpose.  If you're only getting one lens maybe try a 35mm."

Just know that what you're talking about is slicing on 100 MbPS H.264, which will be exceedingly demanding on your hardware. You're going to want a metric crapload of RAM (16GB ain't going to cut it, 32+ recommended) a good, and well supported GPU, and a powerful CPU.

That some editing software can't handle it at all. That's why I'm asking what people have found to be the most useful for editing those file types.

This can be a problem if you ever record theater, speeches, sermons or other long-form events. It also lacks a mic jack.   If you're thinking about trading in your camcorder for a 4K still/video hybrid camera, the Panasonic G7 ($797.99 with the 14-42 kit lens and a free Audio Technica AT8024 shotgun mic) has a larger sensor than the Sony - plus interchangeable lenses. It also records 1080p for hours continuously and 4K for 30 minutes at a time.  Plus, it has a mic jack.  No , it doesn't have the RX100 IV's amazing slow motion frame rates - but it is $200 cheaper.

Seems odd to offer it as a PHP app, rather than as a subscription service though - I'm not sure exactly how many videographers would bother paying for hosting, figuring out FTP and then uploading this rather than just signing up for something simple like squarespace. I gave it a quick go, and after my experience, I just can't recommend it at the moment.  I had a little bit of trouble installing it. It didn't seem to like being installed in a subfolder, and though it worked fine on a subdomain, I had some password issues and the reset link in my email threw a 404. I also had a 404 immediately after the setup process that went away with a refresh - probably has something to do with it generating an .htaccess file during setup and then immediately navigating to a rewritten url. Maybe there's some odd caching on my server that means .htaccess changes aren't happening immediately, I don't know.  I also couldn't get it to display YouTube videos in the gallery area at all. Upon closer inspection, it's because they're using a deprecated version of the YouTube API. Vimeo works fine.  I also tried to view the marketplace to see what other themes were available  - 404.  All in all, I think it's a really good idea, but I'm not sold on the implementation. Even if it wasn't so buggy, I'm not sure that presenting this as a download is the right way to go about it.   Oh, and after going through all this trouble, I checked the GitHub and the last commit was a year ago, so it looks like it's been abandoned. On the plus side, the code seems tidy enough."

videography,3cyqv0,voltjap,5,Sun Jul 12 00:14:40 2015 UTC,"I own the Mk II and have used both. Basically if you own an MkI, don't upgrade, if you have a choice DEFINITELY go MkII. Better eyepiece from the C500, better processor (less noise, I like the color better, better lowlight due to the less noise), better flip out screen and a few other things that don't come to mind but yeah. Those alone are nice to have if you've got the choice. Oh people love the Dual Pixel AF even though I don't know what that actually means practically over... single pixel AF?  Shooting anything with the same cameras is better than using 3 different ones, just for the sake of post and just having homogeneous looking footage in general. Even the refresh rate of the rolling shutter gives every camera a slightly different ""look"" that is more felt than visualized, so one likes to avoid that.  The difference between the two cameras isn't enough to fret over ""should I freelance with A or B;"" if you like the C100 but don't own one and have the choice, get the MkII. You can match the color profile pretty easily to the MkI your coworker has in-camera, so that won't be much of an issue. It's more of an incremental upgrade than a whole new camera. If money is tight, you'd be fine with the MkI on sale. I do recommend getting a recorder like the Atmos Ninja to get the most out of the camera though (I personally have an Odyssey 7Q+ but that's because I went hammer on future-proofing my setup for as far out as possible haha)"

Sorry wasn't clear on me end. :) I own a C100 mk I, but I was thinking about getting rid of 7d and 5d mk iii and picking up another c100 or c100 mk II.   Basically, from a business prospective, if my friend is unavailable to shoot, I'd like a hired 2nd shooter to have one or the other. Not looking to upgrade per se, but didn't know if the upgrade was worth it or should I look into buying another mk I.   I do fancy the 60p, cause I've been shooting slow motion on the gh4. But the dual pixel thing is not of interest (auto focus). I didn't get the upgrade for mk I.   I can color correct, but half the battle I have is matching colors between 3 different cams. It's tedious and boring. Love grading when everything is a evenly matched."
videography,3cyqv0,kwmcmillan,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:23:44 2015 UTC,"Gotcha! In that case, honestly, just get another MkI. It'll be cheaper and easier in the long run. You might want to get some monitors for them though, if you're ever having focus troubles or what have you. I'm in love with the false color on my 7Q+ (granted, it is also a recorder) just because I know I can get my skintones perfectly dialed now. It also has a really awesome edge-based focus assist.   Slowmo on the GH4 is probably just fine, as any type of slowmo will inherently look different than the rest of the scene so people are less likely to notice that you're using a different sensor.  TL;DR - If I was you I'd get another MkI, two Atmos Ninjas, and two monitors with false color and focus assist features."

When I had the chance to use dual C100s for interviews I shot, it was so easy in post it's totally worth it.  Also, the Dual Pixel AF upgrade...it is ok but I just don't trust it.

The sony was usable but fucking hell the panasonic ac8  what I HAD to use on my intern was literally the shittiest ever. The image quality was beyond bad what you would expect at such price. I'd take a freaking Nikon D90 ANY day over that piece of plastic shit. It wasn't even good to have it on my shoulder. (I know it's not the price of a betacam but damn it was so awkwardly and hurts as fuck.)  Worst thing was that I had my GH4 which they wouldn't let me use.  I still have my traumas with that thing  I am sorry for my rant but I had to get that of my chest.
videography,3cvyeq,Me-as-I,5,Sat Jul 11 05:54:06 2015 UTC,"http://www.atomos.com/shogun/ You can check that link for the bitrates etc.  As far as it being a good upgrade, the GH4 is more than enough for most short films. Only thing i would change about it and why  i didn't get it is because of the low light performance.   The FS700 is a beast of a camera, hence the price. But i wouldn't suggest for it unless you need the slow motion, which imo is being overused in these times.   A much better buy would be the A7s and a bunch of Sharp APSC glass. Hell, even getting sharp and good glass for the GH4 might give you more versatility as a film maker.  Cinematography is only 1 part of film making. Getting basic gear and investing the rest in other things like budget for a film or courses or traveling might also be a good idea. Goodluck with your choice, i hope i helped you out ;)"
videography,3cvyeq,cruzz903,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:15:09 2015 UTC,"Another reason I should have mentioned that is a problem with the GH4 is the 4K it shoots is compressed and only 8-bit, so color correction is limited there.  Thanks for the advice."
videography,3cvyeq,InjuredGods,3,Sat Jul 11 12:59:51 2015 UTC,"If you have a Shogun why aren't you recording 10-bit??  The FS-700 is still an amazing camera, even at 3 years old. With the new 6.4 Shogun update getting 4k ProRes out of the FS700 is simple and you don't need to pay for the feature like with the Odyssey. Granted you won't be getting actual RAW files but its definitely better then HD! Unfortunately you are still limited to a 16 second burst mode shooting at 120fps even if recording to the Shogun. I just asked Atomos support about that last night.  Just remember if you purchase the RAW unlock code from Convergent Design that's another $700 you have to budget.  When shooting 4K/2K RAW you are getting a 12bit signal. Also just want to make sure you understand you are not going to get 4K out of the camera without an external recorder. It can only do compressed 4:2:0 8-bit files internally."
videography,3cvyeq,InjuredGods,2,Sat Jul 11 13:40:19 2015 UTC,"In cases where I can attach the Shogun I use the A7S. THe GH4 is for when I want a lighter or portable rig, or when I am using both cameras at once so that I can at least get 4K out of both cameras.  If I get the FS700 I will need to get another recorder anyway so I can shoot with two cams at once, so maybe another Shogun would be better? And it would still give me 12-bit?  I do realize it has very limited capabilities without a recorder. Maybe the FS7 without a recorder would be a better option? It seems it is more ergonomic than the FS700. I was looking at the URSA but the main issue there is it only goes to 60FPS and it is too heavy for my steadicam solo."
videography,3cvyeq,HybridCamRev,2,Sat Jul 11 14:00:21 2015 UTC,"Right now the Shogun can only take the RAW signal from the FS700 and convert it to a 10bit 4:2:2 ProRes file. You won't be getting a clean 12bit RAW file out of the Shogun. At the moment only the 7Q and the AXSR5 recorder can do that. I personally don't see the Shogun ever being able to do a 12 bit file tbh.  The FS7 is great. It can do 4K up to 10-bit 4:2:2 internally. However if you ever want to upgrade to RAW you'll need the extension unit as well as the Odyssey, which will be another $5000 or so.  The Ursa can do up to 80fps currently and with the upgradeable sensor I think they are trying to go up to at least 100fps. But it is heavy af and isn't very conducive to run and gun type shoots and performs best in a controlled environment."

If you're a solo shooter, need a gradable 10-bit codec and want internal 4K plus 1080p slow motion, $7999 for a standalone FS7 seems to make more sense than buying a $4999 FS700 that needs a $1695 external recorder to capture 4K  - plus the extra money for a rig to get it up on your shoulder."
videography,3cvyeq,HybridCamRev,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:16:02 2015 UTC,I'm in a two man crew most of the time. So you think the FS7 without a recorder is better because of the portability?

videography,3cvyeq,merchantfilm,2,Sun Jul 12 01:50:34 2015 UTC,"Hi /u/Me-as-I - even with a two man crew, the FS7 is still the better option (if budget permits).  My top 3 reasons for recommending the $7999 FS7 over the $4999 FS700:   Ergonomics - the built-in shoulder mount and remote grip are much more user-friendly than the ""boxy"" FS700. Internal 4K - not only is recording internally more convenient, but it also does away with extra cables, connections and external recorders - and reduces the likelihood of equipment challenges in the middle of a shoot. Internal 12-bit RAW and bit rates at up to 600mbps - the FS700 is 8 bit only with a maximum bit rate of 28mbps.   The FS700 was a great camera for its day, and still produces great images - but, in my opinion, time and technology have passed it by.  Again, hope this is helpful!"

The 18-105G is a fine lens, much better for video and much more versitile with no need for a bunch of post work to get the same results.

At the price point, it was the best fit that I could find for myself.  Native lens selection is a little slim if you're on a budget, but old glass is great and totally accessible with adapters if you don't mind being limited to manual focus and lacking image stabilization, but that could be easily remedied with a tri/monopod.  Like you said, the fact that it's light and small is amazing. It doesn't hurt to have it hanging around my neck all day.

I believe Sony has one camera out right now but its a bridge camera.  For 4k video I do like Samsung colors the best but Samsung uses H.265 and its hard to edit to need to convert H.265 to another format to edit. The only other problem with Samsung 4k there is a sometimes some moire.  One thing the Panasonic G7 was reported that at a shutter of a 100th of a second made images a little soft.

Have a second shooter getting candida candids. These are great for filling in your edit. Have at least three times the amount of storage you think you may need. Make sure you have a place for battery charging, or have a car attachment. And bring enough batteries. If you need to plug your lights in, make sure you have sorted this out with the venue.

Great for spray and pray lighting, but literally ANY other lights are going to look better.  Some things to note about LED:  Depending on the CRI of your lights (and really just luck with the specific ones you purchased), you may or may not have a serious color shift.  They're harsh. You've got 30x30 super tiny lights in an array all with miniature highlights pointed at your subject. Buy diffusion panels to place in front of them to turn it into a smoother source. Don't just put diff on the barn doors because you'll essentially just be scrimming it down.  Don't point them straight into somebody's eyes.  Seriously,  the output is surprisingly bright and it's easy to inadvertently blind your talent.   That said, LED panels are great in the commercial sphere.

Unlike the GH2, it has a standard 3.5mm mic jack (my GH2 has a strange 2.5mm mic jack that requires an adapter for standard mics).  Unlike the T3i or T4i, it can record continuously for hours, rather than minutes.  And, unlike the GH2, T3i or T4i, it records at up to 1080/60fps for smooth slow motion.

I just panned it on a tripod in a normal environment and looked at the monitor. Got to handle the Blackmagic Micro with a Video Assist and was able to make it crash by accident lol, rep said it's because it's a beta model and happens when you go over to a certain part of the menus. They actually showed a video from this guy (one river media) about working with 8 bit vs RAW at the event, 2 year old video though VERY interesting/informative. For ISO they were saying how even 1600 looks very clean, but 800 is best from the footage they've seen. I think it's safe to say the 4.6K is really that good... I mean the skintone rendition is amazing, the low light capability is good enough if you throw any lighting at it (though not massive amount of control of aperture like A7s), the URSA smaller makes sense, and 4K was already plenty detail. The biggest thing to lookout for of course is the quoted 15 stops of available dynamic range, but honestly when it comes down to it the 12-13 stop models even look great compared to a RED, what you offer the camera is more important then what the camera offers you at this point. So as long as it's not buggy it'll be great, reliability is more important when you get into this ballpark of camera use so it shouldn't be an afterthought."

In my experience very few consumer USB 3.0 interfaces are good enough to reach full speed.   True, though I'd argue that no USB 3.0 interface of any kind is capable of achieving its maximum rated throughput, as we've seen with almost a decade of USB 2.0 tech.   I got around 110MB/s through two different USB 3.0 enclosures and around 126MB/s with higher peaks through SATA   FYI, 110MB/s is less than 1GbPS and 126MB/s is just barely over the line. Keep in mind that the original SATA specification is 1.5GbPS, so these disks aren't even exceeding the specification that was set up twelve years ago. SSDs, on the other hand, have been clocked up into the 263MB/s range on USB 3, which gets closer to SATA II speeds.   a WD Green and a similar result with a WD Red.   For the record, WD Green and WD Red drives are almost 100% identical, except for some changes in the firmware regarding things like TLER that make one more suitable in a RAID array than the other.

In my experience, testing 5,400 RPM disks against 7,200 RPM disks the difference in performance level was quite stark, in the neighborhood of 30-50 MB/s, depending on the operations being performed. I haven't had the chance to stick an SSD in there, but I expect it would show some improvement.   Consumer USB 3.0 sucks, from my own experience.   That's why you buy quality gear. But that's not a limitation of USB 3.0, that's a limitation of the specific chipset being used, and no one is going to stick a high performance chipset into a low performing drive."

videography,3coqq0,WolframAlpha-Bot,2,Thu Jul 9 21:11:48 2015 UTC,"I would highly encourage investing in a RAID drive. I suggest doing your research first, but long story short is as follows: RAID drives create their own backups, in arguably the most efficient way. They use multiple HDDs in one system to keep you from losing information. They are very common and popular with creative professionals. Depending on the platform you have, you can get different ones. Being a Mac user, I'm very fond of Thunderbolt friendly ones, because you can easily edit straight off of the drive. Here's a relatively cheap one for sale on Amazon:  http://www.amazon.com/Book-dual-drive-high-speed-premium-storage/dp/B00KU68A1A/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1436460651&sr=8-1&keywords=RAID+drive"

RAID is designed for high-availability, in case one drive fails, you can keep working.  But there are so many other things that can happen to your data, depending on RAID as a backup is a huge mistake.  If you have file corruption or a virus, RAID will just give you two copies of bad data.  This could be a slow unnoticeable corruption until it is too late.  That's why people always say RAID is not a backup.  Always have real offsite (or at least offline) backup if your data is valuable."

I believe acquiring a shoulder rig should be the first step -- then bring in the steadicam.  My reasoning is that you'll likely find yourself wanting a shoulder-rig more than steadicam. Shoulder shots are proven to be steady and necessary for many applications you've stated, and steadicams are more for (if you will) specialty shots.   Also, follow focusing is a major concern, and steadicams do not allow for very precise on-the-go focusing without a costly wireless focusing rig."

It will ruin shots for you when the WB shifts during an important moment or your exposure suddenly drops because you panned over an exposed light source. Your best bet is to modulate your aperture and WB according to the scene. Be quick, decisive, and know when you have a chance to make an adjustment. If you are working outside in sunlight you will want some ND filters. And if you have a Canon dslr look into magic lantern. It unlocks all sorts of useful features like histograms and  zoom focus during video recording."

I use it to give some ballparks, tweak if needed, and then put everything on manual so it stays there.  For events especially there's just too much happening and the camera will have a seizure trying to keep track of things and you'll be fighting it trying to get it to focus on what you want rather than what it wants."

The original one you linked is a ""product on white"" cheapest price point, you'd typically not photograph the cord in the main image, or remove it in Photoshop, and if they are paying for detail images (mouseovers) we'd shoot the cord separately. The ones  Blackmagic uses are lifestyle shots, higher price point because more work is needed for props, models, styling, etc.  The top image from Blackmagic is a mix between a product on white and lifestyle in that it shows the product working, again, upcharge over product on white.   As an example, here is something we shot for Kitchenaid in our studio, and when I did the editing I had to remove the black power cable.

videography,3cnkx3,putin_vor,2,Thu Jul 9 12:42:09 2015 UTC,"How much can I push the image in post from a C100?   Pretty far with Canon LOG   How much difference is there between that and say a Nikon D800?   The challenge with DSLRs is the tension between the pixel count for high resolution stills (36.3MP in the case of the D800) - and the relatively low pixel count required for video (approximately 2MP per 1080p video frame).  Camera manufacturers deal with this through the use of ""line skipping"" or ""pixel binning"" video processing software.  They then have to implement this software in hardware in near real time at 24 frames per second and higher.  With the D800, Nikon did not do this very well, resulting in a phenomenon called ""moire"" (seen here and on the roof here).  Camcorders and cinema cameras (such as the C100) don't have this problem.  Designed for video from the outset, their sensors are more closely matched to the resolution requirements of video.  In my view, with a $7500 budget, you can do better than a DSLR.  Again, hope this is helpful!"

videography,3cnee8,ebarbaric,3,Thu Jul 9 06:45:49 2015 UTC,Most shotguns aren't great for indoor use. But I've heard that the Røde NTG-3 is decent inside. Even better is the Audio Technica 4053b.  But I'd consider using a lav as well. You can get Oscar SoundTech lavs or AspecMic lavs without breaking the bank (sub $100 and $50 respectively). The lav can get real close to the source. You can even make a poor-man's wireless setup by placing the Zoom H1 + lav on the subject (but you can't monitor the sound that way). If it's a sitdown interview you can just plug the lav and boom into the audio recorder and monitor that way.
videography,3cnee8,Madmanden,3,Thu Jul 9 07:20:29 2015 UTC,"I can confirm that the Rode NTG-3 is pretty good inside.   I've used it on both narrative and to record myself for lectures and similar.   I'd also suggest a RodeLink wireless lavalier system - relatively inexpensive, much more recent tech than other wireless systems, and very simple to use. If you don't have to hide the mic (bloody narrative work) then it's pretty much perfect."
videography,3cnee8,cairmen,2,Thu Jul 9 17:26:18 2015 UTC,"I was looking at the EW100 G3 kit as well. I'm a bit worries about rustling with movement with a lav though - is that an issue?  Also, with my current setup - I don't monitor much, since it's me on the camera, and I'd like to keep this as simple as possible so hoping to avoid post audio matching.   That being the reason I'm looking at shotguns."
videography,3cnee8,KD8PIJ,2,Thu Jul 9 14:01:52 2015 UTC,"Read up on how to properly lav talent and you won't have issues with rustling. There are plenty of youtube videos.   I don't monitor much   Sure, I understand it's hard to multitask. Just keep in mind that the day that you realize you screwed up your audio after a shoot is the day you'll never not monitor your audio again.   Looking at shotguns   You're looking at shotguns for the wrong reasons. It sounds like you're making pretty standard podcast-style videos? If you have treated walls then you're probably always recording from a stationary position, and not very far away? Thus, why go with a shotgun? You might look into a studio-type microphone,  AKG or Audio-Technica, cardioid or hypercardioid pattern, maybe switchable to omni if you have good isolation. You can get a lot of bang for your buck for a few hundred dollars. Then use the rest of your budget to pick up a better audio recorder with XLR inputs and phantom power. Connect line out of the recorder to the input of the camera like you do now, and be happy that you can use the recorder for backup audio.  EDIT: If you are farther away from the camera, then yeah, a shotgun or hypercardioid might be better. A lav would be best. Just realize that trying to avoid having to sync is not the reason to look for a certain type of mic. Sync is needed, or not needed, regardless of using a lav, shotgun, studio mic, etc."
videography,3cnee8,KD8PIJ,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:18:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I did come across the NT3 (which I can get locally) as an option. Would something like that be a better choice?  This is what the videos generally look like. It was shot using the cheapo shotgun.  I have a boom stand, so I'm able to get the mic about 16 - 24"" away from my face, just out of the frame. And just to clarify, I do monitor before shooting to make sure levels are correct.  So, I'm definitely open to suggestions as this is not my wheelhouse."
videography,3cnee8,KD8PIJ,2,Fri Jul 10 01:13:08 2015 UTC,"NT3, as in the Rode NTG3? It's a good mic.  You wouldn't necessarily need a recorder with phantom power, because the NTG3 can be battery powered itself, but I'll still recommend a better recorder than the Zoom H1 or H2n if you're looking to upgrade gear.  Frankly, your sound is pretty ok for what gear you are using. Take that as a compliment. I'm still on the fence as to whether a shotgun is the 'right' answer, though. Take a look at some hypercardioids and see what you think."

My boss spent a long time even wrapping them all I gift wrap, something we don't do, and the person requested a gift receipt in each box.   All 40 of them were returned for credit over the next few weeks, apparently one person opened it, they all saw it and everyone returned theirs for their gift card without even trying it. But I told my boss it was going to happen, I'm a camera nerd and I had the option for this camera or a $450 gift card, I'd take the gift card in a heartbeat, so think of someone who doesn't even know what it is going to do.    But, one of them was bought and returned earlier and I played with it, it's a neat idea, but the quality is so bad and the sensor is so small that the selective focus thing only works if it's really close up. But I like the idea, that it takes a picture instantly and no focus time at all, but if the resolution is 1mp and looks like garbage in indoor lighting, it's not really worth it."

videography,3chyuq,MacintoshEddie,9,Wed Jul 8 01:44:05 2015 UTC,"Actually, the camera is way more complicated/interesting than that. It actually captures all the focus fields at the same instant.   It's able to do that with a combination of a micro-lens array and a special sensor that not only detects light intensity and color, but the direction the light is coming from too.   The camera spits out a proprietary file and then you have to use special software to interpret the image and choose the focus.   So there is a lot of extra information, but it's not literally a stack of refocused copies of the same photo.   *Edit: normal cmos camera sensors are used."

To clarify im not shooting the wedding for the client. Im simply there to practice/film a promo video for them.

Because I'm just gonna say, if you show up with the Sony FDR, which is a beefed up handycam, your clients are gonna think ""amateur hour"". Stuff like that matters, IMO. If someone showed up to a shoot with that sony, I'd kick them out of the building. You can swing the SLR as pro, but not the handycam. What exactly are you filming indoors? Interviews? Sports?"
videography,3cgbm6,DeeDeeInDC,3,Tue Jul 7 18:54:54 2015 UTC,"You can swing the SLR as pro, but not the handycam   Uh, I don't know about you, but clients questions SLR as video cameras too. You overestimate the ability of laymen. If you and I look at a Sony A7S, we know its a god amongst cameras. If a laymen client sees it, he'll be like ""WTF is this tiny retro point-and-shoot? Get out"".   If anything, that first result from the camcorder link would impress  ""normal"" clients more. Now if he contracts for someone more knowledgeable, yes the Sony FDR would look amateur compared to a fully loaded A7S."
videography,3cgbm6,Rajminster,2,Tue Jul 7 19:59:42 2015 UTC,"I think you're wrong my friend. He has money for accessories. All he needs is a decent rig and headphones for the SLR and no one will question it. Nothing he puts on the handycam will make it look legit. SLRs as cams are pretty commonplace now. I see them everywhere, but I've never seen someone with a handycam and a press pass."
videography,3cgbm6,DeeDeeInDC,5,Tue Jul 7 20:02:54 2015 UTC,"Sorry I just realized you and him were talking about the Sony Consumer 4K FDR and not the pro ones with a top handle. Yes that definitely looks too amateurish.   Also, it depends on who he works for. You're right that SLRs/mirrorless for video have become much more commonplace, but the stigma among commonfolk is still there.   My friend owns traditional pro camcorders and I own a Samsung NX1 and a Canon 60D. Wherever we show people our cameras, they always assume his footage will look better and more professional, then they're absolutely blown away by the footage from my cameras. (Granted my friend does event recording and I do more cinematic stuff, so each of us chose cameras appropriately)."
videography,3cgbm6,Rajminster,2,Tue Jul 7 20:14:09 2015 UTC,"Haha, no prob, I had to check too because I also thought it was the big version. I would advise people to not buy that one either though. It's legit looking, but it's first gen and the sensor is not that great. I'm guessing your friend has a camcorder that looks like real deal camcorder and not a handycam though."

At your price point, DSLRs/mirrorless bring so much more bang for your buck and simply produce better looking videos.   Also, look at the Panasonic G7. Much more suited to your needs than the FZ1000. Or maybe get a used GH2 and hack it. You'll get super high bitrate  1080p video on the cheap."

I don't know ho wmuch it will affect editing.
videography,3cgbm6,AShavedApe,2,Tue Jul 7 23:17:24 2015 UTC,"When you're editing, the preview window will basically always be smaller than 60% of the whole screen anyway. Why would this be an issue?"

videography,3cgbm6,Rajminster,3,Wed Jul 8 00:16:57 2015 UTC,It's a nonissue. 1080p will have the same resolution on a 2k screen or an 8k screen. Show them literally anything like the Blu-ray Avengers or anything on your screen and it'll be the same res as your 1080 video. It doesn't magically look worse on a higher resolution screen and 1080 stills looks awesome unless you're blowing it up 100% or using a terrible codec.
videography,3cgbm6,fear4fun,2,Wed Jul 8 00:48:20 2015 UTC,"i dont know why they'd be upset, but i get what you're saying. you worry that the presentation might be lacking. don't worry itll look fine. i use a non-retina 27"" imac and i think its 2560x1440. full screen previews look great unless youre 3 inches from the screen. on my canvas is FCP7, a 1080 clip is about 50% size, and takes up about 1/4 of my screen.   also, its one thing to shoot in 4k, and i love it so much, but its another to store all that mess, not to mention the processing power."
videography,3cgbm6,texbird,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:08:54 2015 UTC,"Set your preview window to only show video at actual pixel size. Plus, you should be using that extra real estate to have more windows and tracks open, not a bigger video playback panel. Plus, stuttering 4K footage will look worse than smooth 1080p. My i7-3770K w/ GTX 760 cannot handle 4K h264. I have to transcode to ProRes (ProRes is super smooth though, very space intensive thoug).   However, you're right 4K is fantastic looking and useful. I love re framing my shots, stabilizing, and just having ridiculous detail. Go for the 4K camera if you feel ready."
videography,3cgbm6,they-call-me-MRmadiq,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:35:05 2015 UTC,"I think I will just play around with maths and make the GH4 workable and go for the 12-35mm lense kit. I mean, even 1080p is still the standart and it will need atleast the end of the pascal architecture to get dx12 games  stable at 60fps with just 1 card so I guess, we won't see 4k screens as standarts that fast. I just think that the few extras with the gh4 will be worth over time, since I won't update that quicka nd I would be upset if I spend 800€ on a cam and discover that I would like to dive deep into it and who ever knows, work as a photographer / videograph. Then I would be very upset.   Another difference I found is, that you can choose between NTSC and PAL. I don't know if it is somewhat possible with all the options to use 30fps in PAL power regions, that could become handy.   Simply because I will mix up 30fps screen recordings with 25fps/50 fps reallife recording, that wouldn't look great so if I could get 30fps work in the normally flimmering 5,5k calvin light without turning down the fps to 25fps that could become very usefull!"

videography,3cengd,Qontinent,4,Tue Jul 7 09:06:16 2015 UTC,"As a viewer, I think I'd probably find the format a little annoying. 10 minutes doesn't seem long enough to justify splitting a video into two parts, especially if it's going to have a cliffhanger of 'Tune in tommorow for the remainder of the list' as - to me - that's just obvious clickbait. If I clicked a video titled 'Top Ten Things' and I only got the bottom 5 of said top ten, I probably wouldn't come back to your channel.  However, for the same reason I'd think it may be worth trying to see how your viewers respond to it.  That hook might be enough to encourage higher user engagement as they feel compulsed to return to the site. There's no denying that clickbait works, but it depends on your audience. Some viewers won't like it, but it's whether or not they're a minority that's important, and you won't know without running tests and using analytics."

I hate the idea of clickbait and hopefully I won't fall into it as im doing it more science and education but oh well :)  So 10mins isn't too long for a video becuase I heard the average length of people watching is about 3-5mins. Im building a catalog of videos to release in a few months so maybe its safer to release all the Top10s and then when I do have an audience start with one or two Split videos.

videography,3cengd,MacintoshEddie,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:52:35 2015 UTC,"In many cases the average view length is due to music videos that are only 3-5 minutes long.  It all comes down to the content.  If you have good content and solid delivery there will be people who watch for 10, 20, or even 30 minutes.  The key is not bloating your video length, but also not cutting out good parts.  Quite a few of these types of videos have the guy spending 4 minutes talking about what he wants to talk about, and then 25 seconds of content."

The headphone port should have pretty low latency, though the 2i2 does have a direct monitoring switch which routes both inputs straight into the headphone jack instead of routing through your machine.

videography,3caql4,Piklikl,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:14:17 2015 UTC,Dumb question: how do you do this? Is it as simple as dropping a 60fps clip into a 24fps sequence? Or do you need to adjust the clip duration (slow it down ~200%) too?
videography,3caql4,brocahantas,3,Mon Jul 6 20:21:32 2015 UTC,"If you drop the clip into a 24fps sequence and slow it down, it will slowdown correctly (smoothly). 200% is way too much. 24fps is 40% of 60, so it can be dropped to 40% speed. In a 30fps sequence do 50%  Unless you meant 200% duration in which case yes"
videography,3caql4,Qbeck,2,Mon Jul 6 20:26:15 2015 UTC,"Whoops, yeah I did mean 200% duration. Your description makes sense.  Second question: People like shooting/editing in 24fps for a cinematic look, but shooting in 60fps (or higher) is nice because you then have the option of proper slow-mo if needed. Could you just always shoot in 60fps then? If you drop a 60fps clip in a 24fps and DON'T slow it down, will it still have that 24fps ""look?"""
videography,3caql4,brocahantas,5,Mon Jul 6 20:30:00 2015 UTC,"Yep, but your shutter speed will most likely be higher than if you shot it at 24 and therefore you will have less motion blur. Watch action scenes of saving private Ryan to see what that would look like. You can add blur in after effects with some plugins but obviously doing it in camera is nicer to your editor."
videography,3caql4,Qbeck,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:36:41 2015 UTC,"Why would your shutter speed be faster? Because if you're shooting at 60fps with the intention of slowing it down, you probably have a faster shutter speed?"
videography,3caql4,brocahantas,2,Mon Jul 6 20:49:01 2015 UTC,"This is where we get to an area where I hope someone with production experience can step in, but the slowest shutter you can have for 60fps is 1/120, whereas in in 24fps you can do 1/50 because something something 180 degree I'm not sure.  What I do know is that the footage you shoot in 60 will stand out from the 24fps, but thats not necessarily bad."
videography,3caql4,Qbeck,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:03:52 2015 UTC,"Depending on the camera you can set the frame rate and shutter speed independently.  Meaning you could set the shutter speed to much slower or faster than the frame rate.  A slower shutter produces more motion blur whereas as faster speed cleans up the blur but too fast and the images will jump.  The basic rule of thumb for any frame rate is to double(or close to double if your camera has limited shutter options) the shutter speed in relation to the frame rate, for example 24/48, 30/60, 60/120.  In my opinion it is best to stick with this even when you are shooting with a higher speed to crank later.  This rule is not set in stone but it will give you the optimal sense of motion. In some cases more than double can be used to create a hectic look to the action and you can sometimes go lower than double to get more light in a low action/movement situation."
videography,3caql4,pjoshyb,2,Tue Jul 7 01:51:32 2015 UTC,Shooting in 60fps requires more light than 24fps as well..
videography,3caql4,phloating_man,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:59:31 2015 UTC,How come? Because you need to use a faster shutter speed (1/50 for 24fps vs. 1/120 for 60fps)?

I thought it was going to be an interview to a single person in a quiet place and I though I could just also use a lavalier, however I just talked to the client,  they want it to be more like a news report where I ask a few questions to the attendants. I guess I will have to change the mic"
videography,3cc69n,KD8PIJ,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:13:58 2015 UTC,"To continue....  Alright. Full stop.  You for sure need a second person to help you. Someone who can handle themselves independently with video, and especially audio. They have to be knowledgable in audio. If you can't get the company to help pay for this person, and you want to keep the gig and keep from producing a terrible product, your only chance is to pay out of your own pocket. Find another college student, who again knows audio, and tell them they'd get a free helicopter ride out of it. I'd probably do it for that and a meal. Just for giggles, where are you located? ;)  Here's why you need this person:   As someone suggested, you'll want to have 2 cameras running in the helicopter. One wide, one tight. Likely 2 cameras at the event. Maybe even 2 for the interview. This person would take the audio out of your hands. You focus solely on video and production, you share setting up lighting. This person would boom op during the interview, and simultaneously listen to the audio you're recording. General moral support. Because it seems you are unprepared. And nervous. And you cannot be either when interfacing with a client.   Let's talk more about audio.  So you have 3 mics total.   Wireless (I assume) Lav  Sennheiser Shotgun w/boom  Videomic Pro   I've put these more/less in order of importance. The lav and boom are both important together.  You certainly want to use all three of these. Put the Videomic Pro on one of the cameras, because that's the only place that it'll be useful. Read up on how to set useful audio levels on Canon DSLRs.  You need an external recorder to record the other 2 channels of mics. Something like a Zoom or Tascam. Needs XLR connectors. Maybe your school has one in working condition. Boom goes in channel 1, Lav receiver in 2. Read up on how to set useful audio levels on a recorder.  One thing to think about: If your audio guy is booming, he can capture both you and the interviewer by moving the mic around. Lav the interviewee. Then, if you have to, you can always go back and re-record the questions you asked if the audio isn't clean. If you can't have a second lav (and have it recorded), then focus on getting good audio for just the person being interviewed.  An alternate scenario exists where you replace one of the two mics (boom/lav) with a handheld interview mic, and speak into that / have the interviewee speak into it, just like a reporter does.  If you're outside, which it sounds like is the case, think about wind protection. You probably will need a blimp on the boom, something on the handheld if you use it, and maybe some foam or even a little fuzzy on the lav if it's really blowing. Also, both you and your audio guy should learn how to properly mount a lav on talent.  Now test the set up. Get your audio guy and run a mock interview. Have him swing the boom and be monitoring the audio. Set up lights, cameras on tripods. Take the files, put them into an editor, and make sure you have good, clean audio and video.  Do this twice. Three times. Do it inside, do it outside, do it on the moon, do it underwater (not actually!). MAKE SURE EVERYTHING WORKS"

As it is a wired lavalier and we will be interviewing random people I guess it will be easier to replace it for the handheld interview mic. I will use a tascam (which is brand new so I got lucky).   I'm in Mexico so I guess your free helicopter ride will be postponed :( but I really REALLY appreciate your help, I will definately take everything into account and make all the necessary tests to work it out. :) I send you a lot of virtual hugs"

videography,3ccoj7,sportingkcmo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:50:00 2015 UTC,"I used the HF G10 for the same use and am sure the HF G20 will work plenty fine for you, but honestly you should fix your lighting so everything is evenly lit because you don't want to have to have your exposure change when you are only using one camera and it looks better. ""Stabilization"" is very important, your video will become very boring if you don't have a medium shot or a full body shot where you are tracking the speaker... just having the right gear won't get the job done right. For audio you can run a line out of your mixer into the camera so you don't have to worry about syncing in post, just make sure there is no delay and if there is then it's still faster to piece together in post then having 2 seperate files as long as the audio doesn't drift further off with time. I did not live stream and most large churches don't by choice, they don't want to have it as a reason for people to skip church, but instead a way to resource people who may not be local, are interested in visiting but are unsure of the environment, or who work on the weekends. Getting into live streaming is becoming easier, but focus on making a watchable video first - plus you can choose which service is the best in case something unexpected happens. Eventually you could throw in a Blackmagic production switcher for $1K and easily incorporate the slides from the screen and add another camera to the mix."
videography,3ccoj7,AnthonyWithNoH,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:23:05 2015 UTC,"I remember the days of being right there. I was an intern at a small church and one day they asked if I knew anything about media stuff. Meaning both sound and video. When I said no, they told me, in not so many words, that I had better figure it out quick because I was in charge of it now. I fell in love and eventually went on to get a B.A. in Digital Film and have worked as a Front of House Engineer for about 12 years (on and off) now. So, I have done both portions of church, and non-church, media. This will come into play later in my response. So, Perhaps the best way I can answer this for you is to address your concerns one by one, then wrap it all up in a nice package at the end for you.   Video Quality - These days, you will have a hard time finding things that shoot in a resolution of less than 1080. But, resolution is only one part of a quality image. It also has to deal with sharpness, which is impacted by the lens (which I will talk about a bit more later), the sensor, and the operator. Image quality is also impacted by color. If your sensor does not read color well, your image will not look good.   Low-Light recording - Of course there are spec sheets on this that give you some arbitrary number about how many LUX or Lumens the camera will operate in. What those specs don’t tell you, is how much noise will be added to your image at lower light levels as gain in increased to compensate. So, a suggestion here would be, once you decide on a couple of cameras that match other features you want, do a search for those camera models, followed by low light test. Of course, those results can be influenced by your lens, which is where I come back to that topic. If you get a camera with a sensor that is only mediocre in terms of light responsiveness, that can be overcome with a lens that can operate at maybe T1.5 or something. So, if you haven’t noticed here, I am putting a lot of emphasis on lenses to help improve some aspects of your camera. Keep that in mind.  Sound Quality - You said that this was a feature that was not so important to you. But, there is one thing I would like to address about this. If you can swing it, I would suggest finding a camera that has AT LEAST a 1/8th inch input for external sound, if not XLR. This would be so you could create a passable auxiliary mix from your front of house mixer and send that you your camera. My main reason for this is simple: time. You said you record the audio separate and sync. That’s fine, but what happens if you are sick sometime. Or worse yet, what happens if you find out that you experience a situation where you just bought this camera and there is a significant difference in latency between the audio on your external recorder and the audio on your camera?  Stabilization - Eh. If it’s going to be on a tripod and operated by someone who doesn’t attempt to punch it to pan and isn’t in an area where their will be lots of vibration from people moving, should be fine.   I’m going to take the liberty of skipping some items here.  Ability to Stream Live video and ability to control by smartphone or remote - I would highly suggest against both of these features. You will be spending money on something that, from what I can read in your request, is totally unnecessary. This means, you will be sacrificing quality for something that you didn’t express any need to prior to this.   The last factor here is budget. So, I am sure you are fully aware that $1,000 bucks is not much. I am also sure that is something that you don’t have much control over. But, the problem with it is that in that range, you will get cameras like the ones you listed. Those cameras probably have a good image. But, they are designed for someone to shoot home videos and vacations. They are not likely to give you a good image quality at lower light levels. They also are unlikely to have the ability to manual focus. You might think that’s a good thing. But, most auto-focus systems, don’t work well from long distances or in low light. You would be better served by something that allows for manual focus. So, here is my suggestion.  Start all over. Look at cameras that have features like interchangeable lenses. That one is most important here, IMO. This is for all the reasons I listed above: you can improve your ability to shoot in low light situations, will have a sharper image, and it will, likely, have the ability to correct the focus manually. Plus, it will allow you to upgrade your image quality via the replacement of a single part verses a whole camera in the future. The second most important feature for your intended use, would be audio inputs.   So, this all gets back to budget. It’s going be tight to get a camera that serves the needs that you listed in that price range. Not impossible. Sure, you can get a camera in that price range that, at first glance, looks great. LOOK! It’s 18080p and has like a zillion power zoom. It looks flashy. That’s on purpose. Those cameras are marketed at consumers, people who wanted the coolest looking/sounding gadget. But, when it comes down to creating a quality product to put on your website, the cold truth is, these won’t get you there. You want to have the best video you can possibly afford to put on your site right? You said your church is quickly growing. As someone who has spent a lot of time in churches, it shouldn’t matter to me what the video on your site LOOKS like. But, instead it should matter what the pastor is SAYING in the video. But, that’s to me. I was in college once. Most college kids have spent almost 0 time in churches. At their age, if a places website LOOKS like junk, then the place IS junk. I know it’s hard to stomach, but that’s the truth of it. The first challenge with people under 50 is getting them in the door. All that to say this:  I would reconsider your choices. I, personally, think that you would be better served by a good DSLR and good lens. There’s two problems with this choice. The most obvious is price. A Nikon D7100, which is very good, starts at about $900 for just the body. Add to the a Rokinon 85mm T1.5 lens for $270 and you aren’t too far above your budget here and your just left to consider the other concern with DSLRs in your situation. The second, and way less obvious problem with a DSLR is recording time. I don’t mean how much you can record. I mean that since video is not the primary function of these cameras, they are designed to only shoot video for a certain amount of time at once so the sensor doesn’t melt down. The D7100, in this example, records for a max of 20 minutes at a time. If you don’t record the music and your pastor doesn’t go on forever, that might be ok. But, it likely isn’t.  This means that you might have to look at professional level video cameras. This means money. Stepping into that realm puts you into the $2,000 range BEFORE a lens. I know this is not good news. But, I can tell you from experience. You will not get the results you want in the situation you want with the cameras you listed. I hate to come off as a negative nancy, but, the choices here are not great. You might also consider just waiting. Give it another 6 months or so and the church might have been able to set back the money for a camera that WILL get you what you guys want for years to come. Otherwise, it will be use a lower end camera and get lower end results.   Remember, these are all just my OPINIONS. Please don’t let me rule you guys’ choice. But, I can say that I have considerable time working in this same situation. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.   TL;DR - Consider if you have to have the camera RIGHT NOW, or if you need a good set-up."

It has wi-fi for wireless file transfer and remote control from your phone or tablet.  It also has a built-in viewfinder (unlike the V750/770), so you can use it outdoors in bright sunlight, if you need to.

Criticisms: The use of the green screen in the recap felt unnecessary. The microphone needs to to have a covering at all times to keep the wind from blowing.  The use of the filter between the guys talking at 1:15 made them look ultra saturated. I'm assuming white balance wasn't done properly or something else but who knows.  Overall, I give it a 3 out of 5. I see it doesn't take itself seriously and that's a nice break every now and then."

videography,3ccr0f,Evoxity,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:09:55 2015 UTC,"It's a lot of personal preference.  I personally enjoy using a large shoulder mount camcorder with a TV zoom lens.  If you're shooting outdoors, a viewfinder is always nice, as is XLR mic inputs and headphone jacks if you are worried about capturing good quality sound.  A lot of people seem to enjoy using DSLRs and that may work for you; but keep in mind a lot of them only record 10 minute clips.  If you've ever been on a shoot where people are using DSLRs, the most common thing you will hear is ""Did that last part record?""   I would recommend the Sony HDR-CX900EB just for the fact of the viewfinder, instead of trying to use a LCD screen outdoors."
videography,3ccr0f,killapimp,2,Mon Jul 6 22:53:29 2015 UTC,Fz1000 and GH4 both have digital viewfinders and the GH4 doesn't have a recording limit - I've recorded for over an hour straight without overheating issues or recording being stopped automatically.
videography,3ccr0f,AnthonyWithNoH,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:45:32 2015 UTC,"Add the Panasonic G7 to your list. Pretty much fixes most of your FZ1000 dilemmas. ($800 BTW)  Don't get a Sony handycam. At least not at this price point. The mirrorless wonders will be better for you at this price range.   The GH4 is fantastic if you can afford it.   I own a Samsung NX1 which I got for $1300. I love it, and you should look into it. However, it is a ""hipster"" camera and not as widely used. Since you seem newer to all this, maybe sticking with a Panasonic would be better since the userbase is much bigger."
videography,3ccr0f,Rajminster,2,Tue Jul 7 20:22:39 2015 UTC,"Holy balls! Thanks a freaking lot for mentioning the G7! For some reason I didn't had it on my list. The GH4 is't available at my retailer and I can't afford 1300€ for the body so I had to spend a lot for the lense aswell, I guess. I'll look into the G7 and will check it out. How close is it to the GH4? What are the differences?  Just in case I could manage to get the GH4, which kind of lense would you recommend for close to 2m distance video recording in daylight / 5,5k light? It should have a mostly quiet autofocus ofc :p."
videography,3ccr0f,Rajminster,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:16:12 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I kinda like the G7 over a GH4 (yea you read that right).  I'm not an expert, but the big differences are the GH4 has a weather sealed body (my NX1 is weather sealed, would never let it near water anyway though).   No headphone jack.   The GH4 has unlimited recording time. If you're an event shooter, it's a problem, otherwise big whoop. 29min59s is plenty of time.   The G7 and GH4 share the same sensor. Video quality looks identical in 4K. 1080p however, the GH4 records up to 200mbs whereas the G7 is really low at like 28mbps. Only 60fps too, no 96fps slow-mo.   The low-light performance during video is surprisingly better than the GH4.    Some video adjustments like luminance levels are not available. Most of the good stuff is still there though. Zebras, histogram, peaking, etc.  Lenses, I'm not an expert I'm not going to BS you. However, I've heard the Sigma 18-35mm and Panasonic Leica lenses are very good for it.    The G7 is pretty much a GH4 Lite. The price is super attractive for me. I would gladly get one as a B camera later."

I thought he looked a bit lonely in the full body shot and that it should either be tighter or used more sparingly. The mid shots and close ups were much more interesting. Bringing into focus sometimes took too long and this effect should also probably be used less often. Audio seemed a bit hollow. I used to it by the end but you should spend some time playing with EQ to get a better sound.  Overall though I liked it.

videography,3cbbii,bangerrang,2,Fri Jul 10 22:27:36 2015 UTC,"More importantly, looks like she's using two decent output rectangular softboxes fairly close to her which creates a nice even lighting, a catch light in her eyes and makes the window behind her not blown out highlights which adds a more high end camera feel to it. You can match what she did fairly easily... Canon DSLR, 35mm, 85mm, and maybe even a macro adapter. You could get away a more simplistic approach even.

videography,3cadur,Tywinlanister92,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:11:30 2015 UTC,Do a lot of research on shoulder rigs. I own one and I almost never use it. After a couple years I have shed a lot of things like that. People focus on having a big matte box and follow focus and all that but a lot of times with a dslr its best to just fly as light as possible.

videography,3c9ukd,EonzHiglo,2,Mon Jul 6 05:54:33 2015 UTC,"Huh, I was really getting into it, and all the shots looked great, and then it hits me with 3 shots of a dude awkwardly holding a baseball bat, and then something weird about a clown. It's also weird to see that woman talking when the demo reel previously contained no ""talking"" at all. At this point the demo reel loses all cohesion and any sense of unity. (You did make the right choice not to include her sound, since none of the other shots do!)   I feel like your most epic shots should really be at the end. So you could almost just end it right there on a long shot of the mountain at 1:14. If you feel like you really need to include that other stuff, I'd say use just one shot, maybe two shots from each of those projects. The poker game was well filmed... I say two shots for that one! But you should still end with the epic city/mountain shots.  Yes, you're attached to this stuff since you made it, but less is more, my friend. Less is more.  edit:  Oh, and the opening name and logo really slows it down, since it take 15 seconds just to see your first shot. We don't know or care who you or E-H films are, since we know nothing about you yet. Let us see the demo reel first, THEN tell us your name and show us your fancy animated logo in its full glory. If you must show the logo first like that, make it quick, no more than 2 seconds I think.  If you have a compelling reason for putting your name and contact info FIRST, I say keep it there. But it doesn't need to last so long, since anyone who cares is going to pause the video anyway. Otherwise, put it at the very end after the logo."

I think I might start with just my name cause I don't want them going in completely blind, but its a very good point. As far as the other stuff, I think that it did kind of fall apart at the end. The plan was in the beginning to take 4-5 clips from each short and combine them to give a sense of cohesion from clip to clip. The only point I disagree on is the saving the mountains for last and that is only from a musical stand point. The music doesn't build that much at the end so matching epic visuals with the softer parts of the song seems like a mismatch. Would you recommend taking out all talking parts? Thanks for the feedback!"
videography,3c9ukd,Tflipflop,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:09:21 2015 UTC,"Just the one shot of that woman staring at the camera, then noiselessly talking, was pretty weird. I'd take that one out.  Certainly, the most epic shots don't HAVE to be at the end, but if the music doesn't build up enough, maybe you need different music.  I know it can't be easy to try to have cohesion between lots of different projects. But you did really well until after the mountain shot - which, by the way, was far too short, considering how much time we'd been given to enjoy the others. Music should not always force you to cut unless it's appropriate!"

From what I've read you need an app that converts the files to .dpx and then you can transcode to prores/cineform. If this is true its pretty interesting.  Edit: I've done some more reading and it does seem to be 8 bit 444 as opposed to 10 bit when downscaled.

videography,3c8vfs,smegasaurus,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:44:51 2015 UTC,"the 444 sample would give you cleaner edges (very noticeable in fine detail, and for keying) while the 10 signal would give each pixel more color options."

Coming from photography, I'm still a little vague on the practical, visable differences between 444/422/420 colour etc. And with my photos I tend to push the colours quite heavily, so I feel 10bit would be a sizable improvement for me over 8bit. But i'm used to 14-bit raw files, so maybe my expectations are already too high!  Good call on the GH4/BMPCC, I think I'll stick with the GH4 for now and hope for V-log and see what that does before I think about changing systems! It does sound like a huge improvement.

If you really want ProRes (and RAW), you can get a brand new-in-box BMPCC with a full factory warranty from a Blackmagic authorized dealer for just $300 more than a $495 Video Assist.  Good luck!"

videography,3c8vfs,joe12south,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:05:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the comment, yeah it sounds like a good plan! I'll definitely hold on to the GH4 for now and see what happens with v-log. I'm in NZ, so new prices are a bit higher, but a used BMPCC is about the same price as a video assist.  The main question for me I guess was - will 10bit ProRes on the GH4 look much different (or have significantly different grade-ability) compared to the BMPCC prores? If not, then the video assist gives me a nice monitor that could go with other cameras in future as well."
videography,3c8vfs,HybridCamRev,2,Mon Jul 6 22:07:44 2015 UTC,"The two cameras are always going to look very different. BM has a ""look"" and Panny has their ""look"". So, in those terms, it's purely a matter of preference.  In terms of pure technical response, once V-LOG is released, the 10bit output from the GH4 to an external recorder is going to compare very well against the ProRes recorded internally by the BMPCC.  And you won't have to change batteries very 10 minutes. ;-)"
videography,3c8r81,JimmyHopkins47,3,Sun Jul 5 23:27:31 2015 UTC,"I started with the T2i and switched to Panasonic in part due to Canon's 12 to 30 minute recording time limit.  With a $500-$800 budget, instead of the G6 or V770, you might want to consider the new  Ultra High Definition ""4K"" Panasonic G7 ($797.99 with the 14-42 kit lens and a free Audio Technica AT8024 shotgun mic).  It has 4 times the resolution of the G6 or the V770, an electronic viewfinder you can actually use for shooting video outdoors in bright sunlight (when the V770's LCD is likely to be washed out) and a built-in intervalometer for time lapses.  Plus, it can give you video image quality that looks like this:   Indianapolis 500 In 4k Away From The City ~ Panasonic G7 [4K] 42.5mm F1.7   Here are a couple of examples from YouTube (please watch at 2160p and your monitor's highest resolution):   LUMIX DMC-G7 Sample Video in 4K by Colin Witherill Panasonic Lumix G7 / G70 Launch - 4K - 4KPhoto Modes (shot in photo/video mode - each frame is an 8MP still photo)   To be fair, your T2i a better still camera - but Panasonic G cameras are a much better all-around choice for both video and stills.  Hope this is helpful and good luck!"

However, I'm not too sure but my 2 monitors highest resolution is 1920x1080, and my gpu is a GTX 970. I wasn't planning on ever being able to get 4K with my setup, so this may be overkill for me. But I am a total noob when it comes to this and I don't know all of the specifics.   And I love my T2i, but just wish I waited a bit longer to get a T4i or model with a flip out screen. I've heard there's not too much differences between these models other than that and that the T4i still has the 12 minute time limit.   Since I want to get a better video camera than the HV20 ASAP, I might just go with buying the G6 body(perhaps eBay is cheaper), and getting this Canon lens adapter.   This leaves me still needing an external microphone and/or recording device as I will need to get a clear enough sound when the instructors are talking while loud music is playing. Do you have any suggestions for this? My HV20's audio gets muddied too much.  Thanks for your help!"
videography,3c8r81,HybridCamRev,2,Mon Jul 6 04:08:01 2015 UTC,"Even on a 1080p display, the G7's 2160p originated material down-resolved to 1080p will look much better than the G6's 1080p originated material - plus, the G7 is a lot more ""future-proof"" than the discontinued Panasonic G6.  Also, the adapter you linked to has no aperture control - so your Canon EOS lenses will be stuck wide open with no way to adjust the iris.  If you do end up buying a used G6 body, you'll want either a $30 DSLRKIT Canon EF to MFT adapter with manual aperture control (works with EF lenses, but not EF-S) - or a $298 Kipon Autofocusing EF to MFT adapter with auto aperture control.

G is a type of lens where the aperture is controlled from within the camera body rather than with an aperture ring on the lens. G lenses have a small mechanical actuator where the body controls the aperture. This is in contrast to D lenses which have aperture rings, and E lenses where the aperture is completely electronically controlled (no aperture ring or mechanical actuator).  D, G, and E lenses are all F mount. An F mount adapter designed for G lenses will also work with D lenses as there's a way to control aperture with either, but it wouldn't work with an E lens unless you're fine with shooting wide open all the time."

videography,3c6mbi,xhart,4,Sun Jul 5 09:33:24 2015 UTC,"I think you need to be a bit more selective on the shots you use of her. This will sound conceded, but I'm trying to focus on how people will see the artist.   Some of the shots just aren't flattering to her. The first close up we have of her @0:02 is the kind of angle that you need to avoid showing. Its really about her chin. When she sings like that her chin goes back and doesn't create flattering angles. As an editor, its your job to make her look great, and the only way we can do that is pick angles that make her look good.   So here are the shots that I would cut/replace... - close up @0:02  - Medium shot @0:34 - Medium shot @0:37  All the rest are good for 2 reasons. Either she is looking up(0:22), or the lighting is flattering and creates definition on her jaw line(0:15). Stay away from shots where her face is pointed at a downward angle, or the lighting is really flat on the camera side of her face and not creating any definition.   Like I said, I know this sounds bad to talk about, and most people don't talking about making people look pretty, but our job is to represent the client in the best way possible.   Also, this idea isn't novel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe3oJnFtA_k  And remember, if you ever have an important work-related call over skype, make sure your webcam is sitting higher than your face so you are forced to look up rather than down with a double chin."

Where as in film, the world you are filming is completely static, but the recording mechanism is capturing at some fraction of a second for every frame, and so movement bring in this motion blur from multiple angles of spatial dimension being displayed on a flat 2d plane (your screen), that you are now used to with 24fps footage, but have still yet to adjust to with 60 fps footage.

The AX33 can record for hours continuously. the AX33 has a mic jack and a headphone jack - the FZ1000 has a mic jack, but no headphone jack for monitoring what you are recording to your audio track. Yes, you can pull decent 8MP still images from Ultra High Definition video. Some camcorders have a standard cold shoe for accessories.  The AX33 does not.  Instead, it has a proprietary Sony ""multi interface shoe"".   You will need a 12,90€ multi interface shoe adapter in order to mount the 399,00€ RodeLink Filmmaker Kit receiver.

videography,3c4wj4,Hushtone,2,Sun Jul 5 06:45:27 2015 UTC,"I own the 18-35mm and its pretty awesome.  And even though its F/1.8 its Tstop is also T/1.8.  It's been my go-to lens for the most part because I tend to film in low light indoors in tight spaces (I need a wide angle).  I will say that although I've read its supposed to be parfocal, mine definitely isn't, it shifts the focus a little bit more than a hair when zooming in and out, which is annoying if set to infinity.  Aside from that, I'd say its a top notch sharp lens for anyone with a cropped sensor.  And even then, I mount it on my A7s (with adapter) in APS-C mode and get amazing shots.  As for the Rokinons, I've only used the 35mm but I got a noticeable amount of chromatic aberration and lack of sharpness until about F/2.8ish.  I have had a bit of bad luck with lenses though so it's hard to say my experience with these is like everyone else's. Having a Zoom lens may be preferable if you are doing a production (although I wouldn't prefer it) and not just event videography, because I've found that people (especially producer/directors) can be impatient/know nothing a-holes and don't like it when you use a small amount of time switching lenses, especially if you're on a tight time schedule.  Anyway, good luck and hope this helps in some way!"

videography,3bvnss,ZebraStriper,14,Thu Jul 2 15:04:05 2015 UTC,"To even use it, you'd have to get an adapter.  I'll assume you go for the inexpensive, passive variety.  Because of crop on the GH4, your 24-70 behaves more like a 50-150.  I'd say 50 is pretty tight starting point, not something I'd want in an 'utility/versatile' lens.  You also lose autofocus and unless you spring for a more expensive, active adapter, you also lose aperture control.  Instead, you could sell that lens and pick up a Panasonic 12-35 f/2.8.  On the GH4, it's basically a 24-70, so it behaves just like your Canon would on a full frame camera.  It will also be smaller, lighter, have autofocus and aperture control.  Now obviously there's a lot more to comparing lenses that just the hard specs, but it's fair to say that on the GH4, the Panasonic 12-35 f/2.8 will be far more versatile and easier to use.  If that 24-70 is your only piece of Canon glass, I think it's a no brainer.  If you have other lenses you want to hang on to, or can be more specfic about the type of shooting you intended to do with the GH4, that might change the calculus a little bit.  I don't own a GH4, but I rented one for a vacation.  I got the Panasonic 12-35 f/2.8 and the 35-100 f/2.8.  The 12-35 was on the camera 85% of the time.  With just those 2 lenses I felt like I had everything I needed."

videography,3bvnss,Sinasis,9,Thu Jul 2 16:37:02 2015 UTC,"You're kind of right.  It's a 5.6 in terms of DOF only, but it's still metering as an f2.8 lens, just like an f2.8 lens on a full frame camera."
videography,3bvnss,Exuberentfool,-1,Thu Jul 2 18:53:04 2015 UTC,"Only because ISO is relative. ISO 100 on a MFT sensor would be equivalent to ISO 400 on FF in order to keep the aperture metering the same, but they call them all ""ISO 100"""

videography,3bvnss,Exuberentfool,-1,Fri Jul 3 01:32:38 2015 UTC,"Correct. Brightness will not vary despite (in this case) 4 times the light being gathered by the FF sensor.

If ISO were absolute and not relative, it would be dependant on the physical amount of light, not the relative brightness of the final image."

While 18-35mm may sound like a limited focal range, it's basically trading 3 primes for a single zoom lens, really near to a 24-55mm f/2.8 full frame equivalence."
videography,3bvnss,AnthonyWithNoH,3,Thu Jul 2 23:58:55 2015 UTC,"A bit of varying answers here. If you want the best look out of your GH4 and lenses you'll want to get a speedbooster - it allows your small GH4 sensor to act like a larger sensor when paired with larger sensor lenses. Canon 24-70 is a great option as well as the Sigma 18-35 and Rokinon/Sigma primes. A Sigma 18-35 1.8 and Canon or Sigma 24-105 F/4 would be another option if you want more flexibility. Personally I don't like the Lumix 12-35, to say it performs like your 24-70 on full frame is absolutely ridiculous... you'll miss out the character, shallow depth of field, and large sensor look of your lens if you settle for the 12-35. I'm also not a fan of the 35-100 2.8, you'd be better off with a 70-200 F/4 speedboosted unless you REALLY need it to be smaller. Lumix lenses are clinical, it's possible to make them look cinematic... BUT it's much more difficult and sometimes not possible to make them look like what we expect from cinema. The new EF Speedbooster XL will make your lenses look like the S35 standard in 4K and an even lower crop factor in 1080p mode, it's a new product from Metabones - I'm getting mine in the mail today (lol I just got it before finishing submitting this reply) and can't wait to use it out in the field. I'm saying all of this as someone who has used the Lumix 12-35 2.8, Lumix 35-100 2.8, Sigma 18-35, Rokinon 85, Canon 50, Canon 24-105 and other lenses for projects on the GH4. The only person I would recommend M43 lenses to is someone who can settle for lack of significant background blur from zoom lenses, needs small lenses, is ok with the video look that we see on TV, and is ok that their lenses won't hold it's resale value as well since their is a WAY smaller market for it. Personally I don't mind the bulk of a Sigma 18-35 1.8 at all and there are plenty of small 30/35/50 1.2/1.4/1.8 prime options for aps-c and full frame that will compete and outperform the small f/.95 lenses you can find for m43 for the same price."

videography,3bw6m3,learnaboutfilm,1 point,Fri Jul 3 09:00:23 2015 UTC,Just looked up the XA20. That thing looks positively tiny without its handle. Cameras have come such a long way in miniaturization.

It may not be cheap enough but it's a good fit with great glass options and decent audio input. Not xlr.   For sound the tascam dr 40 and dr-60 are great with xlr mica and the dr 60 is esp well suited for wireless as it fits nicely in a camera bag or on a stand."
videography,3bw6m3,wesleydumont,2,Fri Jul 3 04:19:13 2015 UTC,I think the zoom q8 might be a good option for you as its an 4 track audio recorder and camera in 1 and very compact.

videography,3bw6m3,chasingsnow,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:39:16 2015 UTC,"The EOS-M is a good suggestion. You can get very inexpensive 239.00 on amazon. Also the EF-M to EF adapter was 30.00 last week. although higher now.  Sound is almost as important for car stuff. You can shoot on a good phone as long as you have good sound. Take a look at  used Tascam DR-60. it has the ability to record two versions of each of two tracks - one at one level, the other at a higher level. This can really be helpful.  As well, you could get two recorders and place (wired or wireless) lavs in the roof fabric or on the dash. This is a very inexpensive way to add production value to your shoot.   As for lenses, if your not shooting at night, I don't think you'll need fast lenses. Try the EOS-M 18-55, if you go that route. I think it's 120.00 used, it's weatherproof, has silent auto-focusing and image stabilization. I think you'll need that wide angle in a car, too.  Lastly, think about a simple monopod - short of course - to use to stabilize the car stuff.  Oh! and if you have any money, look at the Matthews Master Mount. It's a 600.00 hood mount that's absolutely amazing for car stuff. You could likely rent one for a week for 100.00 and just get some establishing shots or what not.  I've probably gone too far, this may be more professional stuff than you're looking for.  The EOS-M and the DR-60 are good bets and remember, Sound is likely the thing that will save you if you plan to show this."

Last night, in a fit of frustration, I decided to try to export with the QuickTime Animation codec just to see what such a lossless codec would give me- and the color is still just as bad as a low-bitrate H.264 export.

I emphasise politely, no one wants to pay an asshole. Might not help you now, but here's what I do to make sure I get paid.   Have a production agreement. Here's one you can modify for your own uses: https://nimia.com/wp-content/uploads/Nimia-Production-Contract-Template.pdf Find out exactly who invoices need to go to - is it their accounts dept? Get a name and email address. Put a 'due date' on the invoice inline with the payment terms you outlined in the production agreement. Typically I issue a 30 day invoice, so I put a due date that's 30 days after the date I send them the invoice. When you invoice, start a new email (don't tack it on to the end of a thread) with Invoice <invoice number> as the subject. Address it to whoever you identified in step 2, but CC in whoever you've been dealing with at the company. Keep all payment related correspondence in this thread. If 30 days rolls around and you haven't been paid (I literally do this on day 31), just send a polite reminder email with the invoice re-attached. Give them another 30 days to get their shit together. If they still haven't got their shit together after that time, gently remind them that further charges should have already incurred (outlined in agreement made in step 1), but you are willing to show good will and forget these charges if payment is made in a timely 7 days.   That's as far as I've ever got - I've always been paid."

It's not that they wanted me to absorb the fee - they were apparently upset that I contacted the venue in the first place...them thinking if I had just showed up without contacting the place, I would have been able to film it."
videography,3bn94v,claytakephotos,7,Tue Jun 30 18:04:20 2015 UTC,They're absolutely stupid then and don't feel bad at all. You don't gamble on permission to shoot. It's a waste of everybody's time.
videography,3bn94v,swaggums,5,Tue Jun 30 20:10:14 2015 UTC,"I shoot a ton of live shows and I've just sort of learned which venues in my area will allow me to shoot and which ones are usually off limits without making a deal with the house. The only thing I would have done differently is approached the band first -- informing them that this venue will probably charge for videography. If it's your first time shooting somewhere, maybe send a discreet email about video coverage. Don't immediately give out details for the set you are shooting in case the band opts to go a more guerrilla route. If the band isn't that popular, or it's an off night -- I've often been able to shoot at larger venues with no one bothering me. With DSLRs I just say I'm shooting photos and make sure to buy a few overpriced drinks so the venue gets their cut."
videography,3bn94v,swaggums,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:12:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info and advice.  I would have had to set up a mic stand on the audience floor for separate audio and a shoulder brace to stabilize the camera.  My concern in asking beforehand was that I anticipated that, once the venue saw my setup, they would ask me to break down. They might have even asked me to leave so as not having to monitor me. In that event, I would be outside late in NYC and trek back home on the train.  You're right, I should have sent an email anonymously and will do so if ever in such a situation again. However, the response likely would have been the same. Consulting with the band first..I'm not sure they comprehended any of this. All they cared about was that I was unwilling to show up.  I also didn't anticipate any compensation if no video footage."

And I make sure the band understands what is going on."
videography,3bn94v,smushkan,3,Wed Jul 1 04:45:06 2015 UTC,Ask those fuckwits if they would pay $500 to play there.  You don't need dipshits like this in your life.
videography,3bn94v,dookievizion,4,Tue Jun 30 18:03:45 2015 UTC,"I'll preface what I'm about to say by stating that you handled this very professionally, and the clients shouldn't have expected you to soak up a $500 charge without you invoicing them for it.  We do a lot of shooting in theatres and other venues (150+ jobs per year, including some London West-End locations), and for this reason we never talk to the theatre. Theatre managers tend to powertrip the moment another professional starts poking around wanting to do something.  To date over ten years of operating, we have had precisely zero operators turned away by a theatre.  Our contract with our clients clearly states that ensuring our operators will be granted entry to the theatre is their responsibility, and that they will be liable for the value of the job in the event that it happens. Again, we've never had to enforce this.  Did you do the right thing? Absolutely. Did you shoot yourself in the foot by finding a reason to not do the job? Probably.  The chances of the theatre interrupting the performance for the sake of telling you to bugger off are realistically quite slim, and their opportunities for recourse for 'breaking their rules' were very limited. If there was a clause in your client's contract preventing them from filming, it would not be you that would be liable - your client would be left picking up the pieces. You're just a contractor, and you don't answer to the theatre."
videography,3bn94v,FOOKIN_LEGEND_M8,2,Tue Jun 30 19:01:49 2015 UTC,"This is a great perspective on it.  I've done that ""shoot myself in the foot"" thing a few times when I've thought I was doing what was professionally right.  I shoot mainly rap videos/concerts and the majority of the time if I just show up with gear and ""act like I'm supposed to be there"" then I've had little to know problems with anything.  (Even access to events I was not on the list for.)    The few times I called myself dealing with ""better people"" and trying to be ""more professional"" in my communication with these sources is when I got the power trips and egotistical individuals doing anything they can to keep me from doing my job."

videography,3bp6q4,fwef23f,2,Wed Jul 1 02:08:06 2015 UTC,"If you are asking what specific camera they used, I can't tell. DSLRs are common these days for low budget web content. The Canon 5D is popular, so is the T2i and 7D."
videography,3bp6q4,edinc90,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:11:03 2015 UTC,can a canon 5d be used as a point and shoot camera. I have my own point and shoot SLR with canon lens. I wonder if I can just get a DSLR and plug in my lens?
videography,3bp6q4,fwef23f,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:51:26 2015 UTC,"Point and shoot generally refers to a camera like this. It's a camera with a non-removable lens, usually no viewfinder, limited manual controls, ""live view"" LCD screen, and a direct optical path to the sensor.  DSLR stands for Digital Single Lens Reflex. That means the light path to the sensor is blocked by a mirror that reflects the light entering the lens into the optical viewfinder. When you hit the shutter button, the mirror flips up and exposes the film (or sensor.) That's why the camera makes a click sound.  So a DSLR isn't a point-and-shoot, by definition.  If your lens is EF mount, it will fit on a 5D. If you have a lens with a different mount, you will need an adapter to get it to fit EF mount."
videography,3bp6q4,edinc90,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:58:59 2015 UTC,Do you honestly believe you can pick up the camera and make decent looking video just because the camera you have is nice? There is so much more that goes into crafting a good image than simply your camera.

videography,3boz0b,sharkie002,5,Tue Jun 30 23:41:07 2015 UTC,"Most professional and pro-sumer cameras have two XLR inputs. If your camera only has a stereo 1/8"" jack, then you will need a dual mono to stereo Y cable. This will put one mic on the left channel, and one on the right. You won't have independent level control though.   The standard inexpensive recorder is the Zoom H4n. It has 2 XLR inputs, as well as a built in stereo mic."
videography,3boz0b,edinc90,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:02:45 2015 UTC,"And just to elaborate on this suggestion, a Beachtek MCC-2 will give you independent level control if you want it. It's a glorified Y cable in a cold-shoe mountable box."
videography,3boz0b,---D,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:14:14 2015 UTC,"Couple things first. 1.  Camera Requirements.  What type of mic input port does your VC have? Typically VC will have a balanced audio input (+, -, gnd) however it's something you should confirm first. As edinc90 said most pro cams will have XLR mic inputs but most non-pro cams will have 3.5mm balanced (tip +, ring -, shield Gnd). There are some that have a 3.5mm unbalanced mono (tip +, shield gnd) and some may also have a 3.5mm unbalanced stereo (tip +, ring +, shield -/gnd).  2.  Type of microphones. What type of mics do you have, dynamic which don't require power or condenser which do require power?   - Dynamic mics are very simple the use but don't really provide much of a frequency range.   - If you are using condenser mics then how are they getting their power, onboard battery or phantom?    - Battery powered mics tend to be cheaper and provide decent frequency range, just not as good as phantom powered condenser mics.   - Condenser mics provide the best ranges but need more solid consistent power than batteries can push, and receive their power remotely such as a mixing board that also pushes 48v phantom power. Good pro VC will provide phantom. You can also put a PP injector inline if needed. 3.  Audio Mixer Here is why It's important to know what the VC and mics need.  You can purchase small 2-in x 1-out mic mixers such as an RDL MX2 (less than $100) audio mixer where each input has a gain attenuator to make slight adjustments with. But if you are using condenser mics and some type of mixer or camera that the mic is getting its power from, adding an in-line mixer (that requires its own power) could damage the circuitry inside the camera, mics and mixers because you would be over-volting the line. What edinc90 recommended is actually a decent inexpensive solution. Just make sure you do some research first and you can make this work. Audio works on very small voltages and is very susceptible to interference and grounding issues which is why I mentioned the balanced/unbalanced connections. It's important to keep the polarities in phase and properly grounded.  Good luck!"

videography,3bom32,adaminc,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:40:33 2015 UTC,"Haven't tried the GH4 yet but overall I do like the X70. Pros for the X70 would be the XAVC 50Mbps 10bit 422 codec, nice crisp, detailed picture. Although I have heard people are having issues importing the XAVC files into Adobe. The built-in ND Filters are a huge plus. XLR inputs. Good form factor, great for run and gun use. Auto focus and image stabilization are pretty good also.  If you're looking for the ability to record in 4k the X70 is not a good choice imo. It has a low bit rate (60Mbps) and costs around an extra $500 for the upgrade. Another thing that sometimes comes up when filming indoors is the yellowish skin tones regardless of WB settings. I do wish manually setting WB was a little more straight forward and easier to do on the fly instead of just using a couple of presets."

Your lighting was really nice on the interview. I would definitely avoid a full profile side shot for your interviewee. It works in certain situations, but not this one. I agree with most of the other comments. Also, at 0:34, watch what seems like a jump cut. When you cut from one framing to another, make sure there's a bigger difference. I would've liked a closer shot, like his head and shoulders. Finally, watch your headroom whenever you have a person talking on camera. I really liked the waterfall shot at the end. I know you were editing your text to the music, but I would've left the realtor's information as well your contact information for a little longer. Overall, great job.

videography,3bi6o2,hipomino,16,Thu Jul 2 16:24:42 2015 UTC,"wooo hooo! congrats man. That first paid gig is always a roller coaster of emotions.   You did really well. I think you should be satisfied with the end product. In an effort to keep improving, I'll give my suggestions.   Audio You had some real audio issues with the guy speaking. First shot, there was so much reverb with his voice. The room wasn't good for recording audio. You should really try to be more selective with that. What were you using to record audio? At 0:34 the reverb improves but the quality of the recording is worse. Regardless of that, just the fact that the audio noticeably changes there, is distracting. If I had to guess what happened, you were recording audio to 2 channels, both set at different levels (a common trick to help protect from clipping) and you switched to a different track at that moment. You need to be blending that change better. I can give you more advice if you tell me your audio set up and what happened there.   Camera Work The 90 degree shot @0:14 was not good. It doesn't do anything to help tell your story. And your story needs to be about this relator and that house. In my head that means there are only two options for a second angle: a Medium Close Up on him that helps the viewer connect with this guy who is trying to sell a home to them, or a Full Shot showing him from head to toe and giving the viewer a better look of that area of the house. The 90 degree shot of the side of his head and the hand rail out of focus, doesn't do either of those things.   The framing of the opening shot was great. I loved the tree limbs and leaves in the frame. What I would have done differently is just to add some light on those leaves. Leaving them dark gives a creepy feeling, like someone is waiting in the shadows stalking the house. This could have been accomplished with a simple day-light balanced LED or just using white poster board to bounce some light back into them.   For the interior shots, I thought a couple of them should have been shot at a higher level. Like the kitchen shot @1:22. Normally, you want to not do this when creating stylized images, but since this is a real-estate video, I feel its best to shoot most things at eye-level. That would be the perspective that most people experience their house and would experience walking through an open house. The shot @1:22 doesn't allow us to see the depth of the space as we are blocked by that counter. Its just too low. The tilt right after that shot is great, because it starts high and ends low, it gives us several details to notice, but the shot @1:22 doesn't give us much.   The shot @2:13 felt out of place. My eyes couldn't decide what I should be focusing on. There was no real subject.   I did love most of the interior shots though. Your movements were really good. I do notice some jittering in some of the sliding shots. I'm not sure if this is a frame rate issue or a panning speed issue.   If your camera can do slow motion, here is something you might want to try with your slider. When shooting still life, I usually shoot in a higher frame rate and then do my slide and pans at a higher speed than normal, then slowing down the footage in post so it looks like a normal speed slide. Doing slides quickly can help with getting consistently smooth slides.  I hope with the money you've made you'll just put it back into your business to make the next video even better. Keep shooting."

Other people have touched on all the audio issues, so I won't got into what you did wrong there, but I'd like to share an idea with you if you have time to reshoot the interview portion. If not, then just try it on the next gig.  As another commenter has said, use the interview audio as a voiceover for the visuals. I wouldn't even plan on showing the realtor, and here's why. You can take that H4n and mount it on a table-top tripod or a stand or something. Have the realtor (or voice over artist if it fits your budget) sit or stand right up to that recorder and talk into it as if it were a stage microphone. The closer your mic is to the talent, the less echo and reverb you'll get. You'll also get the low frequency tones that are missing from the VO now. Tell the person reading to watch what you've shot so far, and listen to the music. Try to get them to speak in a softer tone that matches the ambience of the rest of the video. Tell them to pretend they're Alec Baldwin trying to woo a woman into buying this house or some shit. Do this, and you will get the absolute best audio results possible with the equipment you had at hand. Again, if you have it in your budget you should find someone semi-professional or professional to read the script for you. And if you do use the realtor, and do want to show him, after he says the address and city, start using the audio for VO only. Use a closer angle for the interview so you can get that mic as close as possible to him.  So by doing this, you're accomplishing a few things. You're getting far better audio. You'll be able to match the VO with the feel of the video, which will vastly increase the quality. You'll also by shortening the video by a great deal by taking that first minute and integrating it with the rest of the video.  Just as a side note, match the realtor's name/info with the graphic you used between the interview and the shots of the house. Seems odd that you have that nice graphic, and then at the end it's just some serif centered text. I also feel a bit oddly about credits at the end of a video you're paid to do. I find it unprofessional to include all your info and the music producer's info like that, unless it were something you'd done pro-bono. Maybe something a little less awkward would be a small, simple logo. Garret McCafferty Productions with your website or email underneath, small. And not all caps serif font, please. :-)  Again, beautiful work! I grew up in North Canton, OH and work/live in Toledo now. If I still lived in the NE I would be calling you when I need an extra camera operator on gigs for sure. Good luck!"

Seemed like quality could have been a little better on that and you could tell the difference between a two of the shots on how it sounded with him talking.  Also the shot from the side should either A: Not be used as it's a little weird or B:  Cut away much quicker.  I think in the future unless they want a long video you could always start off with the interview and then have the person talking in the background as music is playing and B roll is going.  Keeps attention much better.

I have a couple of these and they are great especially for quick turn arounds.  It's got all the pro functions, programable buttons, lots of codec and format options, a good zoom lens, and it is as sturdy as they come.    Another bonus to this cam is the dual cards, they can be set up for continuos, back up, or dual codec recording.  They are hot swappable so you can pop in a new card while the other is recording so there are no time limits.

videography,3bjemu,plemoyne,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:28:48 2015 UTC,"In terms of file type, most DSLRs record the h.264 codec to a MP4 wrapper. This is easily edited and has decent file sizes but lacks some of the quality you could get out of say ProRes. Camcorders usually record to AVCHD which can be a pain in the ass to edit with (very taxing on your cpu). But the trade off is that they can record continuously instead of stopping after the 12/29 minute limit on DSLRs.   That's the technical side of it, but /u/hybridcamrev can probably give you a good camera recommendation in that price range which will suit your needs."

Yes they are not worth the list price, but slickdeals.net seems to have the J4 for $200 every few weeks. As a backup, I don't know anything else that would give you the same quality for that price.

I'm not sure if gopros can easily mount an external monitor, but if you had a G6 or similar you can just twist the screen around and view it from below.

videography,3bfkfs,ScreamingPenguin,2,Sun Jun 28 22:41:20 2015 UTC,"All the weight is right on that pistol grip, which was intentional.  I needed the light on top and a spot for my wireless mic pack but the XA-20 only has one shoe, so I had to add the rails, and from there I figured might as well add the grip and shoulder pad for that third point of contact.  I tried it with a counterweight but the rig was light enough to stabilize without it just as well (and I was shooting for a good 4 hours).  I just needed a bit of pressure on the grip to press it steady it onto my shoulder.  The Lanparte gear I have has all been top-notch every time I've used it."

videography,3bfkfs,General_Dirtbaggery,3,Sun Jun 28 23:24:42 2015 UTC,"That's true for most larger cameras like your C100's or ENG rigs because the weight/length of the lens and other elements in front of your shoulder pad is typically much greater than it is here and simply not feasible for holding steady by hand.  As you can see here my entire rig is easily held by one hand on the grip.  Adding a weight on the back was adding enough to nearly double the total weight of the rig.  Plus the rods were only connected by a single vertical connector.  So here, lighter was better.  I was able to get still shots on my feet fully zoomed in (like 500mm equivalent).  With my 6D's rig and all its extras, including a pair of metal articulating handles, I always use the counterweight behind my shoulder to help stabilize the extra weight on the rig."

videography,3bi8xb,Nidty719,3,Mon Jun 29 13:48:19 2015 UTC,"When I was a teenager, before I got my first proper start in the industry, I used to make films on VHS. Shooting on a mixture of VHS and 8mm and editing on VHS. Titling was done with something like this .  That was 20-25 years ago. One day you will learn how it feels to have something you grew up with referenced as ""retro"" or ""vintage"".  Jesus, I feel old.  And it's ironic that I spent many years and lots of money gradually improving the quality of my kit, from VHS and 8mm to S-VHS and Hi-8, then onto DV, then HDV and DSLR. And now you want to reject that and go back to the shitty quality we used to have to put up with? Well, fair enough, actually it sounds kind of cool.   I agree with /u/ParrotLad make your videos on standard modern kit and then record onto VHS for that retro quality. I think you'll find most old VHS cameras disappointing to use.  As for getting the footage into your Mac you'll need something like this (never used it, know nothing about whether it's any good or not, but you'll need something like this.)"
videography,3bi8xb,SimLC,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:12:32 2015 UTC,"Okay so if this is the route to go and it's easier to that route then how does the process of going from modern video, to vhs, and back to modern?"
videography,3bi8xb,SimLC,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:04:54 2015 UTC,"Might be getting a bit pricey, but something like this will give you a full set of anolog inputs and outputs for your mac. So you would record a video using your normal kit, edit it on the mac and use the Intensity to transfer to a VHS recorder . Once you've recorded the movie on tape, you can capture it back to your mac using the Intensity.  There are a lot of VHS camcorders on eBay, so you could go down that route. Might be fun! There's quite a lot of stuff to learn, though. Amazon sells VHS Tape (who the hell is buying this stuff?!)"
videography,3bi8xb,SimLC,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:23:12 2015 UTC,"So would this Intensity thing work the same way if I got a VHS Camcorder. By simply filming directly on the camcorder and then just uploading it directly to the mac and have it digitized right then and there? Does shit work like that? lol seems simple to me- film on a VHS Camcorder, upload to mac. Done. Right? What if you got some shit like Zazzle or whatever its called where its literally just a screen capture of the input of your VHS camcorder. Does it work like that?"
videography,3bi8xb,SimLC,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:07:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, essentially! You would plug the video outputs of your camcorder into the Intensity which would interface with your Mac allowing you to capture directly from the camcorder."

However make sure that the playback facility on whichever camcorder you buy is in good working order.

The locations you have are great but there should be a stronger link between them.   For nit-picky technical stuff, there are a couple places where lighting feels inconsistent.

Ideally with one camera on the person's chest or head, and two other cameras at other angles.  Planning out a shot list could definitely help to avoid issues of feeling like you missed something.  Can you explain your feelings of shots not being good enough?  Is there anything in particular that you can identify, such as motion being too blurry, highlights being overexposed, something else?"
videography,3bgcxw,MacintoshEddie,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:25:33 2015 UTC,"I only have access to the t3i and gopro hero2, but I actually haven't used the gopro as much.  Maybe with some shots, I can't always center my target because they move fast, and I can't keep up without being to shaking. So being distant usually helps, but the target is just too far and it feels not right, until they get closer.  Its just one thing. I would like some critique on my latest video, maybe it can clear things up. I hopefully there is something you can see I don't. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qyi-BuvlVto One thing sure bad about this video, is the slow-mo section, I didn't think about 30fps till editing."
videography,3bgcxw,MacintoshEddie,2,Mon Jun 29 21:28:44 2015 UTC,"One thing you can try is to stabilize the video in post production.  This will chop off the outside edge of the frame in order to reposition the rest to make it seem as though the subject is remaining centered.  You're not going to have as much leeway as someone who is filming in 4k and then downscaling to 1080p, but it should be enough to help smooth things out a bit.    https://youtu.be/gXlDStpJVhM  This is an example of what I mean by stabilizing in post.  The original recording of that was probably substantially jittery.  Other than that the main thing I am seeing right now that could be improved is framing.  In quite a few of those shots parts of the person disappears over the edge of the frame.  Planning out the shots can help account for that, especially if you can see the people rehearsing the technique.  That will let you position the camera in a better spot, as well as let you anticipate the movement to be better able to track it."

And as a personal tip based on my experience as a filmed and viewer, be sure to have the beginning (take off), middle (trick), and end (landing) for each shot/scene.

videography,3bg4mq,Dojugami,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:44:24 2015 UTC,Your options are borderline nil at €200. Look into older mirrorless cameras (GH2 for instance) and see if you can't find a deal there. Micro 4/3 sensors are great on a budget due to their near-S35 size and borderline universal lens mount (a simple ~$20 adapter is all that's needed).
videography,3bg4mq,kwmcmillan,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:42:40 2015 UTC,"One thing to be aware of:  all those action cam style deals have a VERY wide field of view, which can look weird if you're shooting something that's close to the lens.  In a Vlog type video, you're going to notice the room's walls look curved around the center, and the parts of you that are closer to the lens will look distorted.  I don't know of many Vlogs (at least among the ones that I watch) that use those superwide angle action cameras.  You'll be much happier, I think, with the more flat-view of a regular lens.  I wouldn't go under around 20mm, and it'll look best at about 35mm (as long as you're not shooting full-frame, which costs WAY more than 200).  I'd recommend staying away from wide-angle actioncams and get a nice camcorder.  ...unless you want that 'cinema' look... then you'll need more money.  Plain and simple."

If you can do without wi-fi, then you can save a bit of money and get a VIXIA.   If you want to get really good sound, then you might want to consider picking up a small audio recorder like a Zoom H1 and setting it up on a mini tripod at the front of the auditorium. It will do far better than any microphone mounted to the camera. You will have to synch it in post, but it's really not that hard to do."

I don't like the grain/noise that the t3i produces, nor the lack of some of the filmmaking tools in the camera (such as rgb curves, etc.), but the t3i also doesn't output over HDMI at a high enough resolution to justify the purchase of an external monitor, which I'm going to want if I'm going to be using a rig and a glidecam to get a lot of the shots I am going to be focusing on.

I am a GH4 shooter, and it's a great camera, but since you're buying at the end of the summer, you might want to take a look at the Blackmagic URSA Mini 4.6K instead.  It will be a lot easier to get the Mini up on your shoulder than to shoulder mount the GH4.  The Mini also has a 4.6K Super 35 sensor (no focal reducer required), the ability to record 10-bit ProRes (and RAW) internally, built in XLRs and a built in SDI out (instead of flimsy HDMI).  The 4.6K sensor on this camera produces images that look like this (shot with URSA 4.6K):   NAB2015 URSA 4.6K HD-422HQ from Blackmagic Design on Vimeo   Assuming the use of your existing EF lenses, here's what you would need to start shooting:   $4995 Blackmagic URSA Mini 4.6K EF mount $1495 Blackmagic URSA EVF $345 URSA Mini Shoulder Kit $95 URSA V mount battery plate $40 ILED NP-F to V mount adapter $18 2 x Sony NP-F550 batteries $300 128GB CFast 2.0 card (CFast 2.0 prices should come down even more by the end of the summer)   This setup would cost about $800 more than your GH4 package (and $700 less than a body-only Sony FS7), but will give you a camera that is built for filmmaking - and not a compromise still/video camera.

videography,3bflsy,Rajminster,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:57:50 2015 UTC,"I'll try to answer all of your questions in one post :)   Can you explain some of the reasons you like the BM?   Personally, I like my BMPCC because:   It produces amazing, wide latitude, highly gradable 10-bit ProRes or RAW images (even today, two years after its introduction, there is no other manufacturer offering an internal 10-bit 4:2:2 codec in this price range) Blackmagic has updated the camera over the past two years with a series of free firmware updates.  These updates have added features it didn't have when it left the factory - e.g., RAW, fixes to the white orb and black sun problems, on-screen audio meters, the ability to format media in-camera and more) All of their cameras have metal, not plastic, bodies.      I would totally do this, but I'm really nervous about getting anything by BM. I've read a lot of the issues with BM's cameras, but I also see a LOT of people using the BMCC for filming at my level and even higher. What's your opinion on BM? I checked out the URSA Mini and it's pretty awesome.   I don't think you need to be nervous. Hollywood cinematographer Ben Davis was comfortable enough with BM to use the BMPCC extensively on Avengers: Age of Ultron. So was DP Slawomir Idziak, who used it on Natalie Portman's first feature, an adaptation of Amos Oz' A Tale of Love and Darkness. They chose the BMPCC because of its dynamic range and the gradability of Blackmagic's losslessly compressed CinemaDNG RAW  Since you don't need the camera right now, you can wait for it to come out and then evaluate what shooters produce with it.  If you like what you see, buy it.  If not, go ahead and get the GH4.  That said, I'm selling most of my stuff so I can put myself in position to buy a Mini.   Why the 4.6k over 4k?   Higher resolution and wider dynamic range.  I really like the images from the 4K URSA sensor (I moderate an URSA group over on Vimeo) but that 4.6K sample blows them away.  Again, hope this is helpful!"

For the most part Pro Video equipment is very expensive compared to dslr shooting and prosumer cams.  As for the storage options they are very limited atm.  Cfast cards are relatively new and are quite pricey.  Also you are going to want to get the 2.0 cards to handle the transfer rates required for 4k at the highest bit rates so you really can't skimp there.  You could get and external recorder for ssd drives for cheaper media but you have to buy the recorder and also carry that around on the cam.  In studio settings it's not that big of a deal but for run and gun it is less than ideal.  As far as power, it does come with a plug in power supply for plugging into a wall outlet.  Unfortunately vlock and or gold batts cost a to as well but they are the industry standard.  It is nice to see this on this camera but you have to be prepared for the cost.  Be prepared to spend a few hundred on a single batt and charger to get you started.  Being a standard 4pin there are various ways you could put together your own portable battery power but honestly it's best to bite the bullet and go the vlock route for ease of use and dependability.  As you get more pro gear there will be many more uses for that type of battery as well.  Edit:  even though their may be a little sticker shock when it comes to the power and storage options, barring any unforeseen issues with this cam, this will be an amazingly capable camera at this price point."

For the CFast cards, say I got a 256GB card and shot at the maximum storage rate - CinemaDNG RAW - 265 MB/s, does that mean every 4 seconds I am using approximately 1GB on the card.  So the card will only last about 1000seconds - about 16 minutes.  Seems like a lot of expense for not much recording time!  Or are my maths way off?  Yes hopefully it is a good camera.

Your math is on point, yes it will be around 16 minutes and for live or run and gun that is not a lot.  For a planned shoot it isn't that bad as you could dump the footage between shots.  Prices should come down as more cameras start to use this medium but as for now that the price of shooting at such high bitrates.  Thankfully the cards are hot swappable for endless recording but now we just have to wait for the prices to drop."

videography,3bdcxq,fostradamus_,4,Sun Jun 28 03:48:15 2015 UTC,"Here's something I wish someone had told me when I was getting my first serious camera, and it's even more true now than it was then:  They're all good. Really. Every interchangeable lens camera currently being sold from Canon, Nikon, Sony, Panasonic, Fuji- with a few very rare exceptions- can shoot stunning video.   Some have distinct advantages in certain areas. Panasonic has been offering budget 4k. Sony is lightyears ahead in low light video. Canon has a huge audience of people with Canon gear you can borrow from. Nikon continually surprises people who write them off.   See if your home town has a Best Buy with an extended photography section. If so, they'll have the newest top end models of every major brand, save Samsung. Bring several memory cards with you and spend time with something from every company- try a D750 from Nikon, try a 5D from Canon, try an A7 from Sony, try the X-T1 from Fuji. Try a GH4 or FZ1000 from Panasonic. Play with each camera until you have a feel for how to change the aperture, ISO and shutter speed quickly. Spend like an hour there if you have to- the Best Buy people won't throw you out. Ask them questions if they seem like they know their head from their ass- sometimes they do.   Maybe one camera will feel right to you. The ergonomics will be comfortable, the price point will be about what you want to spend, the lens selection will cater to your interests. Maybe not! Maybe you still won't have a  good idea of what's right for you. But you will have learned something about the cameras that's way more important than the spec sheets and numbers and feature lists that get thrown around on here: You will know what they feel like. And shooting with a camera you enjoy using, especially as someone without daily professional requirements to go out and shoot, means a world of difference in getting you to do it."

The 7D Mk II has no viewfinder in video mode, no upgrade path to 4K, no frame rates above 60p and 30 minutes max of continuous recording.  Instead of the $1499 7D Mark II, the best bang for your buck right now might be a $1497.99 GH4 and a $30 DSLRKIT Canon EF (not EF-S) to MFT adapter with manual aperture control.  That way, you can ""bump up"" to the GH4 without spending much more money than for the 7D Mark II.  Over time, you can save up for a $599 Canon EF to MFT Speed Booster to take full advantage of your Canon glass.  With this setup, you'll have built-in 4K for future-proofing, 96fps HD slow motion, a viewfinder that actually works while you're shooting video, hours of continuous recording - and you can keep your current lenses with automatic iris control and image stabilization.

I don't mean ridiculous ""moonlight only"" stuff, I mean shooting indoors with no windows and ordinary lighting. The GH4 struggles over ISO 800, becoming not just noisy but becoming annoyingly soft. I have one and I love it, but it isn't much good when the lighting is poor.  Personally, I'd wait for the A7S II. It hasn't been announced yet, but judging by the A7R II, it's reasonable to expect internal 4k and in-body stabilisation, the two features that were missing from the original A7S.

videography,3bbk4k,arthousedirector,2,Wed Jul 1 08:46:57 2015 UTC,"To me capturing a wedding is so much more than just the event itself. If you don't create an emotional connection with the audience of your film, you've failed at doing your job correctly.  So I definitely agree with you that there can't be a slider shot in every scene, it makes it seem like too much of a template that you're using. It really comes down to your skill at creative storytelling and filmmaking. It's not just the shots (and how you capture them) it's the story that they're telling.  A good story focuses on people and what they're experiencing. After all, that's what they're memories are made of.

If you don't like slider shots,  don't do them.   The popularity of their use stems from the fact that it's aesthetically pleasurable,  but like all cinematic tools, can and will be employed by everyone.   It's ironic, but if you had your way and led some sort of rebellion among videographers (that frequent r/videography, anyways) to refuse slider shots and replaced it instead with these interviews , that would have a greater chance of becoming the next overused trope.

videography,3bbk4k,kj5,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:21:42 2015 UTC,"Oh yes definitely, however I find it's the people with the lower budgets who are like this. Some of my higher end clients are completely open to it and love the idea of the moment's behind the scenes being captured too!"
videography,3bbk4k,kj5,2,Sat Jun 27 22:38:40 2015 UTC,"Yep.    Amen.   I'm with you 110%.   After years of shooting mostly with other studios I'm only booking my own weddings now because I want to come at them with the same philosophy.   My problem is that you can watch all but a handful of wedding videos and at the end you know nothing about the people involved. I tell couples that my litmus test for a good edit is this: if you watch my work, if you pause it every time you learn something that is uniquely ""them"" (meaning the bride, groom and families) and write it down, by the end I want you to look that list over and have a clear idea who everyone is.   If you're just setting a bunch of dress shots to a Ben Rector song and adding audio of a speech with a bunch of cliches you've heard a million times, you're don't get that.   I talk to everyone casually. I interview by chatting and not offering a list of questions that I go through one by one. By doing this I recently got some great audio where the bridesmaids were talking about this hair clip that they have all worn on their wedding day. It's so much nicer to include that than a letter from Paul to the corinthezzzzzzzzzz   I shot with one studio who always wanted to get the cards to each other read out loud for a voiceover. It's nice and all but I'd rather ask them, ""So why did she think you'd like this gift anyways? Why did she get you this? Is she always spoiling you?""  Fuck it. Look right in the camera. Break the fourth wall. I don't care. In ten years a good piece of personality will be cherished more than a crane shot of a cake.   And I know, I know, you have to give the client what they want... But I'm up front with people about the product they'll get. I say that my work isn't for everyone, and if you prefer another style others can serve you better and there are no hard feelings. And it works out. Because some don't book, but I know that if you're booking me then you're on the same page and you're by going to complain that I left my slider and Steadicam at home."
videography,3bbk4k,MacintoshEddie,2,Sun Jun 28 01:05:56 2015 UTC,"To those saying it's what the client wants...  I don't know about you but never had a client say ""do you do slider shots?"". Brides want to hire you because of your reputation or they like your style. And to be honest, reputation is more important. I don't get asked about what camera i use or any gear i use. The only technical questions I am ever asked are ""can you do this?"" to which I reply yes or no. I used to go into it (and still have a bad habit of doing so unfortunatly) but you aren't speaking to people who care about the how.   You know the secret to the best wedding videos? The editing. That will significantly improve the quality of your work. That's what makes some of the best videos with simplistic setups work. Learn to mange  monopod and tripod for the day and you'll understand the most important things for the video."

videography,3bc7eh,8bitkevin,3,Sat Jun 27 20:53:59 2015 UTC,"It will be tough to get decent wireless audio in a show setting on a ""lower budget"".  If you use a DSLR to record the panel, and don't want to sync your sound in post, you will need something like:   a $399 external preamp to avoid noisy DSLR preamps and a $749.95 high quality 2 channel UHF wireless mic   You can cut some corners, but if you're recording from a distance and want to avoid static, hiss and background noise, this is what it's going to cost.  If you are willing to sync your sound in post, however, there is an alternative.  You might want to consider 'miking' your talent with  $60 Aspen HQ-S lavs, individual phones and free Rode Rec LE software for iOS or Smart Voice Recorder or Skyro Voice Recorder for Android.  Yes, you'll have to sync multiple tracks in post - but you'll have quality sound.  With this setup, you can get results like this (example shown is for the Rode SmartLav, but is applicable to other brands).  You'll get much better sound than from cheap wireless mics or piping the sound directly into a DSLR.  For the interviews, you would probably want to record a pro reporter's mic (e.g. the $109 Audio Technica AT8004) directly into a $159.99 TASCAM DR-10X Mini Portable Recorder.  I used this microphone on the show floor at NAB last year and it worked great.  Hope this is helpful and good luck at the convention!"

videography,3bc7eh,HybridCamRev,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:44:16 2015 UTC,"would the Pyle-Pro PDMIC58 Microphone suffice?   Sadly, no - not if you plan to plug it into a DSLR.  The PDMIC58 is a 600 Ohm Low Z mic with a 1/4"" (6.35mm) output.  Your camera's mic level input is probably 2000 Ohms.  With an ordinary 1/4"" to 3.5mm adapter, you'll get muffled, ""staticky"" sound if you get anything at all.  You could make it work with a $10.64 Pyle-Pro Pyle PPFMXLR15 XLR Female to XLR Male cable  and a $15.56 Hosa MIT-156 XLR to 3.5mm transformer/adapter designed to match low Z pro mics to consumer mic inputs.

videography,3baph4,Imaokayassnigga,2,Sat Jun 27 11:53:35 2015 UTC,$70? You're not going to find much of anything quality in that price range. How are you monitoring? Back of the camera? Do you use an lcd loupe? Do you have an external monitor?
videography,3baph4,blickblocks,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:49:45 2015 UTC,Yeah I figured. But Trying to do the best I can with what I have. Don't have an external monitor been looking into that to.
videography,3baph4,blickblocks,2,Sat Jun 27 15:55:40 2015 UTC,"Ok, monitoring is going to be your first thing you want to get out of the way. You could probably just start with an LCD loupe and forgo the shoulder rig. From there you can build up by adding a cage (check out the SmallRig VersaFrame), then adding separate side handles or wood grips onto the vertical rods on the cage, a top handle with cold shoe for your mini shotgun mic or audio recorder (if you're doing that). Honestly a shoulder rig can be a very expensive path to go down and can be avoided unless you really need that sort of rigging. Good reasons to go with a shoulder rig: you're using a V-Mount or Anton Bauer Gold Mount battery system, follow focus and matte box, EVF or a 5-7"" monitor. If you don't need those things, an LCD loupe is a good place to start with handheld DSLR video."
videography,3baph4,blickblocks,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:06:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the help! I apreatiate it a whole lot. I think I'm going go with the smallrig. If I'm going with the smallrig, i should be looking for  external monitor right?"
videography,3baph4,blickblocks,2,Sat Jun 27 19:42:07 2015 UTC,"If you put an external monitor on top of the cage, you're not going to have the stability of an LCD loupe. I started out like this and ended up doing something like a Redrock Micro Captain Stubling with a 7"" monitor on the back; without any kind of optical stabilization my footage was very rough. I always had better luck with just using the LCD loupe, with or without anything else attached to the camera. Because you are pressing the camera up against your face, you have that added point of contact you won't have with handholding. It can even be more stable than a poorly balanced shoulder rig. So all that said, you can use a cage with a loupe, an external LCD, or even an EVF if you have the budget, its just keeping in mind how you're actually going to want to use any of that gear before putting money in."

I feel like I need to sell my obsolete HV30. How would you compare picture quality between the t2i and G6? And do you know much about the G6KK model? Having a flip screen would be so amazing, as I find that the biggest flaw with my t2i.  Thanks again for all of your help!"
videography,3b90vq,HybridCamRev,2,Sat Jun 27 03:49:46 2015 UTC,"How would you compare picture quality between the t2i and G6?   Most Canon DSLRs (to include the T2i) suffer from a phenomenon known as ""moire"" as the result of poor downscaling from their 18MP still sensors to a ~2MP video image.  Panasonic G and GH cameras, on the other hand, have a better downscaling algorithm.  Here are a couple of side-by-sides between the Canon 60D and a moire-resistant Panasonic GH camera:   60D vs GH2 Moire Test Canon 60D vs Panasonic GH2 evil moiré test   Newer Canon cameras are not much better.

Here are some tips to make it better:   1) Invest in a better camera. Ask your parents to buy you one, or get a job and buy it yourself, or half and half. 2) Don't film outside until you have a good microphone. 3) LIGHTING! You can use lamps from around your house and point them at your actor, you can hold a sheet of thin paper in front of the light if it is too bright. (Be careful you don't start a fire.)   Don't let this comment keep you from film making."

videography,3b6p1d,putin_vor,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:50:48 2015 UTC,"Shoot and process in the same settings until the export render time.  If your camera shoots in 1080p/60, that's what you should edit in. This way you can always come back and render in better quality without re-editing everything. There are exceptions to that, of course, for instance when you need to insert a slow motion scene into your regular footage.  In your case you really need to go through your process:  1) Figure out the settings you shot in. Correct them if not 1080p/60.  2) Figure out the settings of your video project.  3) Figure out the settings of your final render.  ""I did 2 VBR passes and at 15bps"" is very suspicious. Your probably meant 15 Mbps."

videography,3b8dr0,jndtv,2,Fri Jun 26 20:12:54 2015 UTC,"My first bit of advice is that it's too long. However, I say that with a grain of salt because I made one longer than this (but that was for an application and it ""recommended"" 5 minutes). Anyway.. I think there are a lot of good shots in this mixed in with some not-so impressive ones. The first few shots seemed pretty weak to me. Low-resolution, weird color.. just not the best. The concert shots are pretty great, I'd definitely keep those (the one slow-motion one of the DJ from behind looks a little off though). The sports shots are very solid, but I'm not a fan of the time lapses you threw in there... just didn't seem very exciting to me. The drone shots of the high school (?) look much better than the opening one IMO. The industrial shots that follow that are good, but there are some ""dead"" ones without much action (static bits of machines doing their thing). I'd say cut those and leave the ones with a little more going. In general I feel like you could trim all of it down a bit and not hold on each shot so long. But I definitely think there's some good material in this! But these are just my thoughts, I'm far from an expert! If you like I can go into a little more specific detail on my thoughts later."

videography,3b8dr0,clone56,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:24:18 2015 UTC,"what the other guy said , try to cut it down the length to like  1-1;30min. You could take out any of the outdoor stuff that has funky color, low res, harsh lighting, it looks like some shots were slowed down in post where they have the frame blending jitter thing happening, not really a good look for slow motion. The timelapse shots are used a lot it feels like, maybe narrow it down to one, I like the one of the soccer field(?) at night, that one was cool. You have some nice camera moves and there are some cool shots in there. If you try to cut the whole duration down by half , I have the feeling you will make the right choices of what to keep in and what to cut."

That really limits how you can frame a shot.  Seems to me that you are going to want to limit your composition to one subject mostly in the center of the frame.

videography,3b5frj,lukini101,2,Fri Jun 26 04:20:25 2015 UTC,"As a former d-1 football player, here is what we look for for review footage: -We would always shoot both games and practices with two camera angles; one from the sideline angle and one from the back of the end zone.  - for the sideline shot, you want to keep all 22 players in frame. This especially important for passing plays -for the Endzone cam this is know as the trenches shot. This is focused towards big guys up the middle. This would be all the linemen, tightened, running backs, and linebackers. This is a tighter shot focused more on blocking schemes and run plays -always fallow the ball  -make sure to start recording early enough so not to miss the beginning of the play. You would be surprised how often this happens. Often it not bad to start recording a few seconds early so that the players and coaches have the pre-snap view. Also, make sure the play is actually over before stoping recording  - much of your work will also include post organization of plays within teams software so that they can easily find specific plays and angles -note that your primary goal is capturing the event for internal review and not to be cinematic."
videography,3b5frj,rzrckfilms,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:14:37 2015 UTC,edit: disregard  The most important shot when shooting sports is the 'hero' shot. That's when a goal/touchdown/basket happens and you immediately cut to a close-up of the player that scored. And right after that you cut to a close of the other team looking defeated or pissed. This really helps you create a story in the game and builds tension. Put your best camera guy on this shot because it can be very hard to follow that close.

videography,3b30cv,_Shush,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:58:56 2015 UTC,Thanks I will check the FS7 out and do a little more research. Looks like that camera can get quite a bit expensive outside the base model without a lens but the reviews I have seen so far make it seem worth it.
videography,3b30cv,Jeemdee,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:24:22 2015 UTC,"You definitely won't be disappointed and it's worth the money. However, you will have to spend a lot of money on XQD cards which might be overkill if you don't have the budget."
videography,3b30cv,Jeemdee,3,Thu Jun 25 19:59:44 2015 UTC,"Keep your eyes on the Black Magic mini also. It's basically a budget fs7, but looks very promising. Of course we have not seen any test or reviews yet, but I'm pretty confident they won't fuck it up. Let's see. ETA is summer of '15 I believe."
videography,3b30cv,HybridCamRev,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:10:19 2015 UTC,I was looking at the mini a few days ago and really interested in it but it seems to be more for cinema type stuff and people with shot list or maybe I am just getting the wrong impression about it. It would be no issue filming 2 hours straight with a BlackMagic camera?
videography,3b30cv,justshitmypants,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:06:33 2015 UTC,"No one has tested it yet (apart from fiddling with it in the NAB booth) so who knows how it'll operate on the field.  It was designed as a more run and gun camera compared to its big brother, the Ursa. That one's meant to be a bigger production camera to work with a crew in a studio, the mini is a light version.  It looks very promising, but I'll await the first reviews when it comes out."
videography,3b53rl,TheTVEditor,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:17:54 2015 UTC,"Blackmagic don't make their power draw public for some reason... Probably because it's not a very impressive number given the number of screens on the camera!  If we extrapolate from this guy's reports on the forums, you'll probably get about an hour-and-a-half usage from that battery."

videography,3b51iy,pixelpersec,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:58:44 2015 UTC,Based on your budget I'd just bring your DSLR along with you. Maybe just 1 lens. If you're using this footage for promo use you don't want to go cheap. Maybe use the $300 to invest in some security measures for your equipment (or insurance).

videography,3b24io,PaRkThEcAr1,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:05:51 2015 UTC,I'd avoid the ghosting as much as possible. I'd go with 24 if I were you.
videography,3b24io,MeneRocks,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:05:36 2015 UTC,"If you right click on the 24fps footage in the timeline and set it to disable resample, it will not ghost the 24 fps footage when put on a 30 fps timeline."

videography,3b24io,PaRkThEcAr1,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:07:04 2015 UTC,My experience is vegas 6 through 11 and in each of those versions smart resample is on by default and it will temporally interpolate frames if the frame-rates don't line up. I have never liked this effect and it can be turned off.  If you have 24 on a 30 timeline you will have a frame-doubling a few times a second but you would have frame dropping with 30 fps footage on a 24 fps timeline and that looks bad too.
videography,3b24io,SlingyRopert,-3,Thu Jun 25 18:30:06 2015 UTC,Could you not just render it at 120 then again dowm to 30?  This is what I'm talking about. This sub is fucking pathetic. You all just downvote rather than explain why that won't work.
videography,3b40po,peanutbr0,3,Thu Jun 25 20:02:49 2015 UTC,"If it comes down to the C100 vs the 5D, get the C100. It will save you a lot of headache. Considering the C100 is only slightly more expensive now it's worth it.   Also, 4K mirror less cameras are the best thing to happen in recent video history. Even if you don't need 4K, these cameras are so much more video friendly than Canon DSLRs. Look at the Sony A7S, Panasonic GH4, and Samsung NX1. They are much cheaper and just so much better for video than a 5D or 6D.   Also, 3 C100s/5Dmk3s gets very costly. Three GH4s will save you more money to spend on accessories. Better accessories, arguably, can get you better video than a better cameras."
videography,3b40po,Rajminster,2,Thu Jun 25 21:32:14 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Canon is behind the times for video right now. GH4's give you so much for the money. Adaptable to any lens system, speed boosters, 4k, 96fps @ 1080, high bit rates, what else do you need? Granted, a camera like the C100 is nice for the built in ND's and XLR's, but external audio recorders are cheap anyway. The 5D3 is a terrible value entirely for video at this point."
videography,3b40po,nvaus,3,Thu Jun 25 22:55:10 2015 UTC,"Budget for a pelican case for every camera, and another for your lenses, and another for your audio recorder, and another for your lav mics, etcetera etcetera. You'll need to build an inventory for all this gear and having everything in clearly delineated cases is going to be the easiest way to keep track of what you have. And Pelican cases are the best way to keep your gear safe, period.   Really camera bodies and lenses should be a quarter to a third of your budget at most, imo"
videography,3b40po,ddt9,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:57:36 2015 UTC,"Great points. The cameras will become obsolete the fastest, while the pelican cases will hold their value for decades."
videography,3b40po,PastramiSwissRye,2,Fri Jun 26 00:48:53 2015 UTC,"This sounds like fun!  Will you need a budget for an editing computer and a footage archival system? That's $2000 minimum, assuming you want to build something reasonably future proof.  Shure SM58 is the standard for ""hand mics"" in many circles.  The 5D MK3 is nearing the end of its reign. The Sony A7s is the DSLR to beat these days.  The ATR-3350 is fantastic. The quality for the price is incredible.  Something that I always use on shoots that no one ever budgets for is ~$200 worth of extension cords."
videography,3b40po,PastramiSwissRye,2,Thu Jun 25 20:37:35 2015 UTC,"Also! If you find the budget is to be lower than you expected, daylight balanced CFL softboxes are very inexpensive when compared to Kinos, Fresnels, or LEDs and they can work in a pinch for basic interview shoots."
videography,3b40po,PastramiSwissRye,2,Thu Jun 25 20:39:06 2015 UTC,"1 last thought - perhaps a single C100, then a pair of 6Ds? The images would still match reasonably well in multicam situations. You'd save a lot of money and still have a great cam for interviews."
videography,3b40po,PastramiSwissRye,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:40:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tips! I should have clarified that storage and an editing rig shouldn't be a problem, as they have just supplied me with a new Mac and two 4 TB 7200 rpm HDDs for my workspace, so those won't be part of the budget thankfully.   Yes, I have heard from many past colleagues that the a7s is a fantastic camera and is one of the best options to go to for shooting in low light, so I'll look into it, considering its also more affordable.  LED panels are fairly expensive, especially the preferred ones that can adjust it's Kelvin temp. I've seen 3 point CFL softbox setups for $60. Would you rather lighting be one of the options to not splurge on, as opposed to audio, sensors, and lenses?"
videography,3b40po,nvaus,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:55:57 2015 UTC,"The cheap softboxes are fine, I've used them for years. You just want to upgrade the bulbs to the $15-$20 85w 5500k bulbs. The ones listed on Amazon currently I believe come with 6500k bulbs which are way too blue for my taste. If you want adjustable color temp just switch the bulbs.  For your shotgun mic I would recommend a Sure Lenshopper with internal flash recording. Flawless audio quality, and huge convenience since they don't need to be wired to a recorder and have integrated levels/monitor out. Built like a tank also."
videography,3b40po,PastramiSwissRye,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:07:31 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say cut your lights to expand your lenses and audio. I love lights. Keep the cfls for just in case your budget is restrictively low.

videography,3b40po,Funkmussel,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:31:46 2015 UTC,"One suggestion I had not seen yet. Instead of just getting 3 of the same zoom lenses ie: the 24-104.  I am not sure what you plan on shooting exactly, but while a zoom is nice for some things, primes are better for even more things.  Grab one or maybe two. Then use the rest of your money on some good primes that will last a long time. Whether that is some L's cause you like canon, or maybe some cheaper Rokinon Cinema Primes, or maybe some old Zeiss glass. While a zoom is nice for some things, I'm guessing your gonna have to do some events for your school? Primes are a lot nicer for getting a cinematic look, and will help you for basically every other kind of project (testimonials, commercials, promotional videos, etc).  As a side note, I help run a small production house and we have a full set of primes, but haven't really bothered yet to own our own zoom. I will rent them semi frequently for specific jobs, but haven't felt like a really needed to own one. That being said, everybody is different!"

If they paid all people that same rate for a 90 minute documentary, it would cost them $540K (just for the footage), then there is the cost of crew, music, distribution, advertising, equipment, locations, yada yada. If you ask for too much, they'll move on without contacting you back, because they're likely on a strict and stressful schedule."

I used it on footage I shot while mountain biking with a GoPro Hero 3. Turned out super smooth and was way more interesting to watch than the regular footage.  The Microsoft Hyperlapse watermark in the lower right corner of the footage will be removed from the final (paid) version according to Microsoft."
videography,3b2kt5,I_HATE_LANDSCAPES,2,Thu Jun 25 13:34:27 2015 UTC,"The idea is that you capture your footage in a flat color profile, which fits a larger range of colors and brightness levels into the image without clipping. Visually, it looks flat and low contrast, but it has a much wider range of possible adjustments that can be done in post, because there is a lot of original information still included in the file. This is obviously bad if you want something that doesn't need to be post produced, such as live broadcast or streaming, but otherwise flat color profiles retain much more information from the sensor.   You can bring out the contrast you want in post, and adjust the levels easily, because everything you want is there, and you're now just filtering out the information you don't need.  Now on the flip side, if the shooting conditions are pretty ideal and you are sure you won't need to make corrections in post, you may save yourself time by getting the look in camera. But if you have a high contrast outdoor scene, or the lighting conditions could change while you're shooting, flat profiles give you the best chance of making it look right after you finish shooting."

And don't be afraid of other processing styles, with punchier contrast.  I lean that way in still photography, and had to prove a potential client wrong when they said that was the only style I know.  So, I did some more ""trendy"" shots.

I really enjoy doing this and will be making more for sure!"
videography,3ayifn,hotdog-water,3,Wed Jun 24 16:26:03 2015 UTC,"Premiere just got the new Lumetri Color Panel - if you're not using it yet, you should.   By the way - the switching frame rates were incredibly distracting. Next you do slow motion, I'd recommend you export it as the lowest frame rate (in this case, if you shot 50 fps and lowered the speed to 50%, that'd be 25 fps). That way, you ensure a steady fps, which is much more pleasing than going to and from 50 fps, like ya got goin on up there.   Also - you'd be able to film in 1080p25 and that'd give you more details in the images - which is not only a good thing in general, but also if you're trying to show of wide angle shots of the city."

videography,3ayifn,bking,2,Wed Jun 24 17:05:08 2015 UTC,"i think what he means is that you shot it all in 50fps, and during the slow mo, it went down to 25fps. so to fix this, you would film the shots you want to be in slowmo at 50fps, and your normal shots at 25fps!"
videography,3ayifn,Semesto,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:54:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's every time the video's not in slow motion the frame rate jumps up to 50 fps. Try looking for that."

My only criticism would be to get some more practice with your sound mix and foley. You're at a very good spot, and with time you'll be able to catch the moments where the mix is not quite subtle enough, and more spots where the sound can compliment the shot.   Some of the sound fx you used in the beginning set up an expectation to hear them later, and they're were very missing. The chains on the swings and the first waves on the wall would have added a ton, even if they were very subtle in the mix.   Overall, fantastic job."

I use a GoPro as a wide then shoot either handheld roaming or fixed at the opposite side of the room/arena to the GoPro then pick moments during applause or natural break points to reset recording, which is exactly what I did for 12 years using video cameras, you never just leave a roaming camera recording wasting tape. If its a bigger event/client/budget you would be able to have more shooters meaning the shot limit is even less of an issue with multiple GoPros and 5D's running you have twice or three times as much material to edit with."
videography,3b2t49,craftychap,3,Thu Jun 25 15:15:11 2015 UTC,"My 6D has never overheated. I've shot many weddings and outdoors plenty of times with it. Solution - Save up and get a real camera like a Canon C100 if you are planning to be serious. -Magic Lantern can enable continuous record so no longer do you have time limits. Also my 6D records for 29:59 not 10 minutes. Once again solved by saving up a little extra and getting a C100 -You don't need autofocus if you are good at what you do - also autofocus is only really required for filming sporting events. Solution- determine what you are filming first then buy a camera based on your needs. Also the C100 has autofocus. -Yes, you can get the jello effect, yes, there are ways to solve this. Solution- don't film in a way that requires you to shake your camera around like a maniac. -Pricing all depends on what you are filming. If it's a sit down interview any novice could get away with a $75 used 50mm lens, any tripod that can hold more than 4 lbs and a wired lav mic with 3.5mm input. -Audio should be recorded separately to an audio recorder. It would be a mistake to record straight into a DSLR 99% of the time. Once again solved by investing a little bit more into a C100 with XLR inputs   So I think that you have valid points but only based on what someone is filming. If you are filming sports then yes get a camcorder - you'd be stupid to film that with a DSLR. But for most everything else, DSLRs have better light sensitivity, better image quality and better portability."
videography,3b2t49,zblaxberg,2,Thu Jun 25 18:38:01 2015 UTC,There are plenty of reasons to hate Canon DSLR's for video. Almost none of them have to do with reasons on this list.
videography,3b2t49,_Shush,3,Thu Jun 25 19:40:39 2015 UTC,"People who have only known a time where kit was affordable and DSLR's were associated with video not as stills only machines need to understand just what it was like to see video from these things for the first time and know you could afford it. I was using an sgpro 35mm adapter on the HVX200 and it was ok, but next to the 5D or 7D it looked like shit. Before even DSLR's the biggest jump in tech we saw was going from 4:3 to 16:9 and then cameras without tape, are you nuts! its easy now to criticise them compared to newer kit but remember those things are only here now because of the popularity of cameras like the 5DMK2."

videography,3b2t49,bondjaybond,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:02:57 2015 UTC,"""Canon"" DSLR hasn't been the video standard for probably close to 3 years. Almost all of your opinions are invalid or outdated in terms of the DSLR (mirrorless) cameras that are actually used for video.   Have never personally run into any issues with any of my GH series cameras overheating. Panasonic spent time making sure this wouldn't be an issue anymore. GH Series has no record limits. A7S does, it's 29 minutes 50 seconds (IIRC), but any halfway decent event videographer is using more than one camera and can just layer the records. DSLR/Mirrorless cameras generally DO have auto focus (at least now). That being said, it is often a really crappy auto focus, but you aren't using these cameras for auto focus situations. You are using them for target isolation and depth of field. Something you should be focusing manually anyway. Forget warping, if you shake or move your camera during any type of shoot, regardless of what the camera may or may not do to the image, that footage is basically unusable to begin with. That being said, yes, the rolling shutter on dslr/mirrorless sucks compared to the global shutter of a true video camera. I don't think people are shooting live news with DSLR's so I don't think many people are taking pans and tilts incredibly fast. Most people in the know realize DLSR isn't a cheaper alternative to video cameras. People who aren't in the know may look at a DSLR+Kit lens combo and think they are making off like a bandit, but the second they do research into the industry they are trying to get into they find out. And if you aren't buying it to get into the videography/filmmaking industry, then just buying the body+kit lens probably is all you'll ever need, and it likely is a cheaper alternative. Really urked by the last bullet point. Ya. We have bad audio. Damn right. It's reference audio at best. But that's why there's external audio recorders. But that's not the part that urked me, what urked me was ""spend some significant time in post."" I'm gonna spend significant time in post no matter what because I want to maintain good credibility.    All that being said, it's a choice. DLSR's/mirrorless aren't made/meant to replace video cameras. They are there to offer an alternative style of shooting. You aren't going to get the contrast or depth of field or dynamic range of a DSLR/mirrorless on any video camera. You can try, but it won't look as good. I don't say this as some fan boy. I'm a news shooter by day. We use 30 thousand dollar ENG cameras that I have to force target isolation on all the time. Everything is in focus all the damn time on these cameras it sucks. I get it so easily and it looks so much better on my GH3 and GH4 at home and when I'm doing side work. Ya audio can sometimes be a pain. But if I'm going to mic someone with an ENG/video camera, I'm gonna put a wireless transmitter in their pocket, and string a lav up their shirt. Instead of it being a wireless transmitter, it's a zoom H1 when using my home camera. I have a Rode shotgun on top of my camera to make matching audio easier in post (by easier I mean its basically automatic with PluralEyes).   One isn't better or worse than the other. They are different. You use them for different things."

I've run a successful video production business for 7 years now on the back of 5D's and 7D's. We're always completely booked up, and get to travel the world doing what we love. None of your so-called issues have ever held us back from creating. We traded in our HVX's for DSLR's and never looked back.

That sucks, but just because you had a bad experience with a rare problem doesn't mean that all Canon DSLRs have the same thing. All I took out of this is that DSLRs aren't for you. That's fine. DSLRs aren't for everyone and a camera is simply a tool. If you're going to be coming here saying ""Don't Use Canon DSLRs For Video"" and give reasons that have to do with your bad low probability experience without looking into the cameras as a whole, expect corrections.  I work for a Wedding company that has been using 5D's (II and III) for 6 years. We shoot 80 weddings a year. For the time I worked for them at least, never had a problem with any hot pixels or overheating. Why did we use them? Because at a point in time, literally every Wedding Videographer was shooting Canon. We were recommended them by other videographers who were using them. In fact, it's only just started now people are finally not using canon DSLRs, but for literally non of the reasons you've listed. Canon DSLRs were also used for literally any kind of production from crash cams in hollywood films to A cams in no budget shorts.  Why am I mentioning this, because people talk all the time about a camera that's unreliable. When the 4K BMCC came out, everyone heard about FPN. When the Red One was still popular, not too many high budget productions wanted to use them because of the many problems it had. The one's that did use them are still scarred. Hot pixels are simply not common (and can also happen in any camera with a digital sensor, not just DSLRs). It definitely can happen and definitely has happened to a lot of people. Just not the majority. Even then though, if you get a hot pixel it's not like it's difficult to fix.  This whole thing might sound like I'm a fanboy, but to be honest Canon DSLRs are bad choices for video for so many other reasons such as lack of features, low bit rates, overpriced, moire/aliasing, and plenty more. Like I said though, just because you got dealt a shitty hand doesn't mean My Problems=All Canon DSLR problems. Aside from the Hotpixels and overheating, you other complaints are also misinformed.    Canon DSLR cameras have shot length limits. Don't count on shooting events longer than 10 or so minutes or you may miss important moments!   Yeah it does suck, but are you leaving your camera unattended? If not, just press the record button again and you'll loose a second.   DSLR cameras in general don't have auto focus. You have to focus your shots or get a follow focus   I'm going to be straight up, if you NEED autofocus, you're either using a movi, glidecam, or are a beginner that needs to learn manual focus.    DSLR cameras may warp your footage if you move or shake them.   The correct term is rolling shutter. Yeah it sucks, but it's very easy to not run into the problem depending on what your shooting (especially wedding).    It may look like an inexpensive alternative to a video camera, but what you save on the body you'll spend on accessories.   Inexpensive to what? You can get camcorders that are the same price and even cheaper then DSLRs. People like DSLRs because they give you a shallow depth of field while camcorders give you infinite depth and a more videoish look. If we're just talking accessories, besides lenses that's literally any camera you get.   Terrible Audio. Canon has an ""Auto Gain Control"" which makes silence between sounds sound terrible. Be prepared to have to hack your firmware with Magic Lantern, record separate audio or spend some significant time in post...   You have literally no idea what you're talking about. On a different note, the internal audio of any camera without a mic is also always reference audio. Even on an FS7, I'm going to attach a mic."

For example, buying the best bang for buck equipment for your canon so you can do better video jobs and get money faster. But i'm guessing you mean you want to litterally buy stuff which you can use on your canon and on your a7s. You can get yourself a set of canon FF lenses or samyang FF lenses for your T2i. So for example a 16-35mm f2.8? 28-70 f2.8 and the 70-200 f2.8. Or get a bunch of fast primes like the 14mm f3.1, the 35mm f 1.8, the 85mm f1.4 and a slow telephoto. Keep in mind that what you choose depends on what you want to do. Also, more expensive does not equal better. What i mean is that you can save a whole year for some zeiss glass and get insane sharpness and performance at the end. Or you could buy 2 lenses for different purposes and create a much better and varied portfolio. Again, it depends on what you want to do. What you can always do is buy yourself some cheap fast primes glass for aps-c and invest in external gear. Things like lights, tripods, production costs, rigs, monitors etc. All these things you can use regardless of the camera. Untill a certain extent of course. Anw, goodluck with your search. :)"

You technically could, but you'll be making significant cost/quality sacrifices on one or both ends of the transition. A glidecam system will be fine so long as the system you choose can support the weight. Gear you can enjoy now: lights and audio. They make a bigger difference than lenses anyway.  100% serious if I had to choose pro lens and no lights or good lights and kit lens, I'd shoot on the kit lens without a moment's hesitation."

videography,3aykys,beauchampy,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:25:25 2015 UTC,"As this is your first, I would say that you would take on roles for filming, editing and delivery, but your client should take on all pre-production roles (scripting, locations, resources, talent, etc).  As for your rates, you need a rate for shooting and a rate for editing. However many days you think it will take to edit, double it. There will always be change requests and you will need to be meticulous in the way you edit."

Orange juice, and most other fruit juices have extremely high levels of sugar.    The other day I saw some new brand of ""low fat protein milk"" that's jumping on the latest ""health drink"" trend. http://lifewaykefir.com/products/strawberry-low-fat-kefir/ A 1 liter bottle has about 80 grams of sugar,sure it's less than 1 litre of Coke, but not by much.

videography,3au58r,thehighplainsdrifter,2,Tue Jun 23 17:00:45 2015 UTC,I've been using Cine-D with sharpness all the way down. Dynamic range is definitely better but I've been noticing it gives everything a slightly yellow tint compared to Natural.

videography,3au58r,bryM2k,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:16:43 2015 UTC,Cine-D stock except for sharpness and noise reduction (-5) and depending on the look I want saturation on -2.

videography,3au58r,johndabaptist,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:04:31 2015 UTC,"The best thing to do IMO is not use the GH4 for anything ""filmic"" or high DR and certainly not try and fake it by just flattening the image in camera. I love the GH4 dont' get me wrong but after a couple months of using it exclusively I am realizing its best suited IMO for that high color TV look, and its functionality, deeper DoF, slowmo, 4k, battery life and the awesome lumix lenses make it great for this event and run and gun and quick turn around stuff. We just got a blackmagic pocket in (have a BMCC too) and ive been playing around with it and you just cannot deny what a difference the images it turns out are: better skin tones, great highlight roll off, immensely more dynamic range. I think cameras are at the price point now where it makes sense to have two or three for different situations.  After all that ranting, I have the best luck with Natural setting, sharpness all down, saturation a few knocks down, contrast a few knocks down and then I play with the color and WB adjustments because you WILL get some odd neon kind of tones, especially with foliage in my experience and the auto WB tends to not be very accurate so stay clear of that. Also, GH4 is noisy, even at ISO 800, just don't take it somewhere dark, rent an as7 or even a 5D.  This is a great blog post to start with on smart use of the GH4"

The rest only increase quality and make your job easier. Focus on the content and have passion for what you do. But most importantly, Love. Spend time with her, show you really want to give it your all. I personally started with a 169 usd cam which could only do 480p for 30 seconds and 240p for 2 minutes. But i loved what i was doing. I dreamt about it, invisioning it, thought everything out. So that iphone she has, is more than enough. Get some nice led lights or if you want to save up some money, build them yourself! Should be about 50 usd max and could be a fun team project. There are probably a few tuts on youtube."
videography,3auoq7,cruzz903,2,Tue Jun 23 19:19:58 2015 UTC,I agree.... I just want to build something cool while she is on vacation so when she comes back she is surprised.  I was thinking like a pvc studio where I could change out the sheets on it like backgrounds.   I really do not know.. just kinda brainstorming.  I am thinking of asking her to write a script of a movie so we can film it when she gets back.. something about 5-7 minutes long with maybe 3 scenes.
videography,3auoq7,cruzz903,3,Tue Jun 23 19:37:08 2015 UTC,"yeah sorry, kinda got lost in that passion for video thing.  I'm assuming that what she is filming is small. So i'd suggest a simple 2 light setup. you said you already had 1 light which causes shadows. For your second light you could get a soft light so something like this: http://www.amazon.com/TaoTronics%C2%AE-Emitting-Temperature-Eye-caring-Adjustable/dp/B00SQYKV0G/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1435094204&sr=8-2&keywords=desk+led+lamp+panel  The point to keep in mind is that soft light comes from emitting light on a large surface(subjective). I'm sure you can find a much cheaper version or maybe build one yourself for much less. Things like hanging some white fabric over the tiny set and shining a light bulb from above could work too. So think about what would work best for this situation.  Another thing which you can do is look into macro photography sets.  I found this tiny sets with lamps for 52 usd http://www.amazon.com/CowboyStudio-Table-Photo-Studio-Light/dp/B001MYASTG/ref=pd_sim_sbs_421_8?ie=UTF8&refRID=1NJ4A7GZ579Z0KP7JVTE  And this comedic looking iphone 4 set. for only 30 usd. http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NTWJA52/ref=psdc_3081461011_t3_B00AQUIBUA  With this budget you would be at 82 dollar. I also looked at some cheap camcorders. I couldn't find much under 100 usd. You might be able to get something for 150USD which would do a better job than the iphone 4, but to stay under budget i'm guessing the iphone 4 is enough. If you look for 2nd hand camcorders i'm sure you can find some nice 480p camcorders for @50 usd. Yes 480p is enough, we went like freaking 20 years or more with that as a standard resolution. I hope this helped, goodluck with your daughters."
videography,3auoq7,MacintoshEddie,3,Tue Jun 23 21:39:25 2015 UTC,"Well, there are some moderately affordable LED lighting kits out there.  I use Digital Juice 128 and 256 sized panels, they come with battery packs so you can move them around and use them without needing to plug them in.  The dimmer knob is about as easy to use as things get.  Those specific ones would likely be a bit more than you want to spend on a light though, but there are some more affordable versions out there.  I know that LEDs are not the greatest choice, but they tend to be cool running and fairly straight forward.  Tungsten lights are great, but she's 9 and we don't need her burning down the house or hurting herself when she forgets how hot the light gets."
videography,3avrve,SolMarch,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:08:13 2015 UTC,"I've actually been considering this lens for my GH4 and EF speedbooster. I have the 18-35mm Sigma for my second cam and the 85mm Samyang and 50mm Nikon f1.8 (with EF adapter) I use on my main cam; but I really could do with something a bit wider with OS for handheld shooting in small low light spaces. I really want to get the 35mm Canon f2 IS but the vignetting wide open is REALLY noticeable. The Sigma 17-50mm OS looks good on paper and is cheaper but I'm worried it's not going to be fast enough, plus the extending barrel and small focus pull really put me off. It's a huge shame the new Sigma 24-35mm f2 didn't have IS in otherwise I would have jumped on it. Canon are supposed to be unveiling new 35mm and 50mm L lenses this year and given their recent trend I suspect they will have IS in as well. I'm really not sure what to do, I might just wait it out!  p.s I like your write ups in general but the product shots are all just fluff; why not some actual shots showing the depth of field that can be obtained wide open, comparison shots with other lenses like the 12-35mm, why not a video showing the OS performance on the GH4. These would be infinitely more useful than say a shot of the lens pouch."

videography,3av3gb,permanent_staff,6,Tue Jun 23 19:14:31 2015 UTC,"It all depends on the motion and depth in your scene - it's a tradeoff when you decide to adjust exposure with ND versus aperture or shutter speed. If there is little motion in your shot, then nobody will ever notice an increased shutter speed. If there is little depth in your shot, then few will ever notice a closed down aperture.  Every shot is different, meaning there are different things you can get away with. Personally, I like deep focus for my run and gun work so I'm likely to close my aperture first, but I've also been shooting a lot lately with shutter speeds up to 1/200 for specific circumstances - so it all depends.  Consistency here doesn't mean that all your settings match exactly from shot to shot, it just means that the whole brew combines to make shots that end up looking alike. Identical settings are a crutch to get you there, but it's not the only (nor the best) way - it's better to know exactly what each setting does in each instance and adjust accordingly.  And speaking as somebody who has been making my living in the top levels of the Hollywood machine for 20 years: if I hear ""cinematic look"" one more time, I think my face might melt off. That notion is dead, let's let it die. Create images that please you and stop worrying if it mimics a dead medium or not."
videography,3av3gb,s_nothing,0,Tue Jun 23 19:26:05 2015 UTC,"Solid response! You make a really good point about the specific requirements of run and gun shooting: if I'm in a fast-paced situation, I should probably go for a deeper focus anyway and leave sexy bokeh for another shot.  So do you use ND filters at all for run and gun, or do you just play with shutter and aperture?"
videography,3av3gb,s_nothing,2,Tue Jun 23 19:43:49 2015 UTC,"So do you use ND filters at all for run and gun   I do, especially when they are built in like with the Amira or C300. Again it depends on several factors, but if they aren't built in, the decision in a run&gun will sometimes even come down to how efficient my AC is at changing them out."
videography,3av3gb,ArtAdamsDP,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:53:46 2015 UTC,Are there things you do to maintain a consistent and perhaps even a slightly cinematic look?   Yes. Use ND filters. They do is allow you to shoot at your chosen f/stop. They don't affect motion blur. Changing your shutter affects motion blur in a very substantial way that will be noticed by our audience.  Using NDs lets you shoot at a consistent f/stop and shutter speed so there aren't crazy changes between depth of field and motion blur between shots. That's cinematic. Using shutter speed to control f/stop is purely amateur.
videography,3av3gb,Geronimouse,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:26:50 2015 UTC,"Why on earth has this been downvoted?  There is no arguing the science here, this is the correct answer.  Unless done with artistic intent, compromising motion blur and movement in your shot by smashing the shutter speed is going to have a really adverse effect on the quality of your footage.  If you want to achieve a particular look by changing your shutter then power to you, but doing it on a job that doesn't warrant it will make you look like an amateur.    You sound just like the fucktards at /r/Filmmakers. That tone is very recognizable and very grating.   Yeah, this is not the way to speak to another person in the industry and will get you a whole lot of disrespect very, very quickly.   This isn't about filmmaking vs videography, it's a technical question about the science of capturing footage.   If you want the fastest, most practical solution to shooting on the fly when you don't have inbuilt NDs, buy a Tiffen Variable ND filter for your most common lens (usually 77mm) and then step down rings for the others. Adjust that before you even touch your aperture, ISO or shutter."

I'm not saying there's one way to do it.

videography,3av3gb,ilykdp,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:16:51 2015 UTC,"I have posted before about the tendency to stick to 1/50 shutter speed for DSLR video, but it does match the ""typical"" film shutter speed of 180 degrees shutter angle.  You could always close down the aperture or increase the shutter speed, but the result effect on the video is too noticeable for my preferences.  Creating deep focus can take away visual attention from the subject - distracting elements in the background you can't control are in crisp focus instead of subtly blurry.  Increased shutter speed will cause motion characteristics to look different, sometimes in a good way, sometimes in a bad way.  It depends on context, but most importantly should be used deliberately for specific moments, otherwise it just seems like a fast and dirty way to get a good exposure rather than an ""artistic choice"".  I have a set of Tiffen ND's (0.6, 0.9, 1.2) and while it does take a 30-60 seconds to put on my lens, I love that I can stay wide open and at 1/50th for consistency.

You have to be very careful to get the right ones for the best quality. Also, monkeying around with lens adapters can be extremely annoying.  On my T3i, my go-to lens is the (now old model) Sigma 30mm 1.4. It can make some fantastic images. However, even a used one would use up all of your budget so I'm not sure that it's the best choice. If you can find a good deal ($200-250) I would maybe go for it. Kendy Ti is a filmmaker that uses a T2i and this lens to great results (he's crazy good at it though)  The ""nifty 50"" Canon 50mm 1.8 is a great and cheap ($100) lens, however, I must admit that I barely use mine as the focal length is just a little too tight.  What I've found is that prime, manual lenses are great for filmmaking (obviously), however, if you do any documentary or run-and-gun work, a zoom lens is very, very useful. If you do any photography, autofocus is very helpful for that, so there are reasons look at lenses with autofocus.  $300 isn't much to work with in the world of lenses, unfortunately. The Canon 24-105mm f4 L series is one of the most versatile and overall quality lenses I have used (although a bit slow), but its $1000. So yeah. :/"

In my opinion, way too much fuss is made about shooting ""flat"".  There's only so much you can do with 8-bit 4.2.0. images.  ""Flat"" is not log - it is not adding more dynamic range or improving the color space.  Flat is just as hard to grade - so your goal should be to get your image as close as possible in camera.  I know, heresy, but the truth is you're better off getting the image how you want it and THEN compressing it, rather than trying to make a flat super compressed image look totally different than as shot."

videography,3asodr,VoyagerVideo,2,Tue Jun 23 14:34:15 2015 UTC,"The best thing you can do is get a good external monitor.  Preferably one with scopes, false color, etc.  One that record the clean signal from your camera is good too, but make sure you understand what this means:  It means you can record your video at a high bitrate and into an edit friendly codec.  It doesn't increase dynamic range and the color space you can record in depends on your camera output (Canon is still 8-bit 420).  A higher bitrate can marginally increase detail, especially if there is a lot going on in your frame (a talking head shot won't look much different).  I am not very familiar with Canon settings, but even if I were, I can't tell you what settings to use to get the desired look you are going for.  You should do extensive testing if you are set on a particular look.  As for ISO - every camera has it's base ISO and above or below that, the camera is decreasing or increasing the gain, which can lead to noise and reduced dynamic range.  These cameras usually have base ISOs under 800.  Again, do tests, but it's really not worth wasting time trying to light for a low ISO when the difference is probably negligible."
videography,3asodr,ltjpunk387,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:44:43 2015 UTC,"Canon X-Video style is a good middle ground between the default styles and super flat styles. It comes out pretty close to what you would expect from a final grade. You won't have to push it very far.  A word on ISO: there is a lot of misinformation around the internet. ISO 100 on the T3i is the best option for additional post production/grading. A lot of people say 160 is best because you get less noise. While true in that regard, 160 is made by running the sensor at 200 and applying a -1/3 stop digital gain before recording. This does reduce noise, but since you ran the sensor at ISO 200, you have less dynamic range."
videography,3asodr,nav13eh,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:40:31 2015 UTC,"EXACTLY THIS. I've been advocating this for a long time now, and everyone says I'm stupid.  Do not use Technicolor Cinestyle. It compresses the already very small 8 bit codec way further and it just falls apart in grading. Instead, use neutral, turn down the sharpness and contrast all the way (which doesn't waste tons of range at the bottom and top like Cinestyle) and turn down the saturation a bit as well.  I guarantee the image will look better this way than from Cinestyle."

videography,3aqac0,optimisticaboutbears,8,Tue Jun 23 15:50:20 2015 UTC,"What an... odd lens.  The Sigma 18-35 - though designed for APS-C and thus vignetting at the wider end of its zoom range - is usable on full frame for roughly the same focal lengths as this new lens, and is slightly faster.  Now I'm probably being paranoid, but that seems slightly suspicious to me. Slightly change the design of the 18-35 so that it's limited by design to the focal lengths that work on full frame, and slightly change the aperture so that it gives the impression that it's got different glass on the inside... sell it for a higher price to a group of people who thought that the 18-35 was not usable at all for them and voila; profit.  That's all conjecture though, Sigmas Art series has been fantastic recently, and this is probably a great lens."
videography,3aqac0,smushkan,10,Mon Jun 22 18:33:25 2015 UTC,"Although I can somewhat understand your suspicion, I'm 99% sure it's not the case. Maybe they can translate the R&D for the 18-35 to the 24-35 so it helped the design, but they're not the same lens in a different package.   The 18-35 APS has 17 elements in 12 groups. The 24-35 FF has 18 elements in 13 groups. But, yes, it could be a fake single-element-group that doesn't do anything. Dimensions are different: 72 vs 82mm filter, and 78 vs 88mm in diameter. Glass is expensive, so they won't make bigger glass just to get a higher price. But well, maybe it's just a half-empty shell. Half empty I said? It's 810g vs 940g. Now, maybe the extra element from (1) weighs a 130 gram, but that's unlikely since thick glass like that would hurt image quality a lot. Maybe they just filled the sides of the bigger housing with stuff to weigh it down. But that's unlikely too. Last but not least: ""limit to the focal length that work on full frame"" would be hard on FF. It's still heavily vignetting at 24mm, 28mm and even 35 has an unacceptable vignette. Here are some examples of the 18-35 on a FF.   So all in all, yes, they probably do share some architecture. Sigma would be crazy to completely redesign a lens when they can borrow from a different lens design. But if anything, it's a scaled up version that simply contains more glass to project a bigger IC, and thus a higher price is justified."
videography,3aqac0,blancblanket,2,Mon Jun 22 22:38:57 2015 UTC,"I just think it is odd that it is 24-35mm & not 24-45mm or 24-50mm (which is about the range the 18-35mm lens offers).  The 1.46x zoom gives you a little bit of range, but honestly very little zoom range at all.  By comparison: 24-70mm is 2.92x & the 24-105mm is 4.38x.  Though the Tokina 11-16mm is 1.45x, which if it works for some people, then it works."

If you have a C100 (or other S35) I could see buying both lenses as 24-45mm on a C100 has some nice uses at f/2.

Firstly there are no real shots of people and A huge part of being a colorist is making sure people look good and have nice skin tones, this reel is good but doesn't really sell you as an all around colorist.  Personally I liked the before version of your first shot more than your graded one.  You took the nice warm street lights and made them a kind of sick yellow.  Your primary grade on the second shot does well to white balance the interior, but I think I would have preferred a secondary correction to the bathroom light so that it wasn't so green.  The plant and computer shots take something that might be a little too cool and warms it to an almost sepia which may be a stylized choice you are making, but it just sort of washes the scene out to me and doesn't push it enough in any direction to make it distinctive.  Many of the shots from the yellow sign at :42 do a good job of making the scene pop. The parking lot at 1:04 looks off to me, the clouds look like they have yellow highlights. The city skyline shot at 1:10 looks really nice.  The last two shots are some of your more drastic and better grades, personally I suggest starting with these two because they look much better in the after version you graded.  Hope I don't come off too harsh, just wanted to give some constructive feedback."

That shows that you can work on real projects and do a good job, but also that you can match shots within a scene or across multiple scenes. It's not hard to create a one-off look for a single shot, but it's another thing to match a series of shots so they look consistent.  Also, I'd show more examples of windowing or secondary corrections. You may need to show those in an additional wipe.  Overall, though, very good start."

I want high speed shooting, I want native stabilization, I want a compact design.  My rig feels like 50 lbs when I'm just doing a basic interview.  I'd love to have a nice compact mirrorless camera.  I'm eye-fucking the Sony A7R ii right now.  Canon dropped the ball these days.  Their 4k monstrosity they released has been annihilated by Sony in every way.  Why can't my C100 do 4k when it has a 4k sensor?  It pisses me off and I'm kind of done with them.  Canon released the C100 autofocus upgrade later on.  Why wasn't that included with the purchase?  The cash grabbing drives me nuts.  That being said, I love my lenses.  The 14 2.8, 50 1.2, 70-200 2.8 is incredible.  I'm not going to stay with Canon for much longer.

videography,3apkzj,Biffmcgee,3,Mon Jun 22 14:11:49 2015 UTC,"Why can't my C100 do 4k when it has a 4k sensor?   Probably because it doesn't have the processing hardware for it. The jump from HD to 4K is huge, and that's a lot of expensive processing power you need to handle it. It was likely omitted for price reasons. The C100 is trying to be the film-equivalent to what the DVX100 was. Yeah, it's less integrated, but filmmakers want the glass and the sensor more than integration, so they did what they had to do to keep the price down (which is partly why the DVX was so popular).  Also for the most part 4K AVCHD (which is what the C100 does) wasn't a thing when the C100 was in development. I mean, it's out there, but it hasn't been tried and tested nearly as much.  There's a lot Canon got wrong with the C100, but I wouldn't hold the 4K against them."

If you have a quick turn around time and don't know who's going to be touching your footage, Canon colors are very accurate.  If we want to talk about their C series, the C100&C300 are some of the most used cameras for Docu and Reality. While there are better quality cameras with different purposes, the C300&C100 are small, lightweight, have C-LOG, and you can adapt either EF or PL glass to it. It has it's downsides that are very concerning such as low bit rates and low DR. The camera however does what it was made to do and does it fantastically.  What's stopping a lot of us from using them and selling their canon gear? They held the competition by it's balls for a long time and didn't really innovate. Now the competition's offers more features for lower prices."

The Canon DSLRs also deliver better looking stills, so there's value there if you're doing photography as well.  Canon SLRs and DSLRs have also been around for eons, so there's ten tons of accessories that are compatible with it and ten tons of other users from which you can draw support from.

In my brief time with the camera, here were my impressions:   the camera is a solid performer at UHD and HD.   it produces very good, noise free, low light performance (I only tested it down to -12dB) the variable crop sensor is great - my lenses are a mix of adapted Canon FD, Adapted Nikkors, classic 4/3 and micro 4/3, so this worked well for me I really liked the camcorder ergonomics with the top handle, built-in NDs and built-in XLRs   But it's not perfect.   I hated the tiny viewfinder - it was nice to have one on a sunny day at the beach, but it was so small as to almost be useless   Bottom Line - I was very happy with the image quality, the built-in ND filters, built-in XLR inputs, the top handle and the overall ergonomics of this camera and feel comfortable recommending it at $3495 body only from an authorized dealer with a US factory warranty - especially for shooters who already have MFT lenses.

It's strange that they're so hard to find, considering that it's a pretty big selling point for the upgrade.  Perhaps they're playing it down in order to build interest in the 4.6k version."

I'm aware of its structural integrity potential, but pvc still racks and bends by design, and if you set it on the ground (very likely since there's presumably no quick release or baby plate on bottom to mount to tripod or cstand) the potential that somebody trips on it, is high. So you've got a large, unwieldy, bendy piece of plastic that can crack pretty easily under body weight.  You won't pull it apart, and it won't break while operating it sure, but those are not the only considerations. Most of the crap I've bought or built cheaply has broken before or after shooting on it. Again, not bashing its utility as a rig.

videography,3alsrn,jtighe,19,Sun Jun 21 15:15:29 2015 UTC,"Camcorders are a system. DSLR's are basically a chip and a lens mount.  With camcorders you get built in XLR, ND filters, dual memory slots (sometimes on board memory), power zoom, image stabilization, AC power, bigger batteries, etc. Very good options for long duration recording's and quick, non story driven material.  The reason DSLR/M's have been so popular is that you're basically buying a chip first, then building from there. So it's all about image quality first, not functionality. You obviously get better/more varied lenses as well. To get the same functionality as a camcorder, you'll need additional accessories making the system less and less ""portable"" as you go.  I love the GH4's I use at work, but I'd rather grab 2 AC90's to record a long lecture/meeting any day.  Also, a $2k camcorder vs. a $2k DSLM is almost apples and oranges.

videography,3alsrn,witoldc,5,Tue Jun 23 22:34:54 2015 UTC,"As someone who owns a GH4 and a camcorder, I would say:   My GH4 has no built-in NDs - so I have to deal with the hassle of screw-on ND filters or matte boxes My GH4 lacks built-in XLR inputs with phantom power, so I have to deal with the hassle of workarounds or external recorders My GH4 lacks dual card slots - so I have no in-camera backup and no relay recording My GH4 lacks a long, autofocusing parfocal power zoom (I can get a 3x power zoom for it, but I'd rather have 10x or more)   I rented a JVC LS300 a few weeks ago - it was really nice to shoot without the hassle of DSLR/DSLM workarounds.  Until Panasonic, Sony, Blackmagic (etc) offer a camera with all of those features for less than $2000, there will be a market for professional camcorders among folks who don't want to carry a bunch of external accessories around (e.g., news shooters, sports shooters, wedding shooters, reality folks, etc.).

Most good dslr rigs are 2-3x the price once you build them up, with widgets upon widgets mounted on a cage that you have to keep track of and hope you don't run out of power anywhere.    Most people don't even get beyond shooting in Program mode on their dslr.  Can they do a home video?  I doubt it.  But with a camcorder they can.    I've seen a lot of super boring 'showreels' that show off someone's ability to put their dslr on a tripod and step down the lens to 1.4.  Ehh...

You could shoot anything with anything you want, but the amount of work that goes into it and the ease of use make a huge difference when on the job.

Follow focus also attaches to 15mm rails and then it depends on your lens as to what type of gear that you use to drive the focus wheel."

The pro zooms should have good focus too like the Panasonic 12-35. The Panasonic 14-140 and 45-175 have good to pretty good AF.

Alternatively, there are compact camera options like the newly-released Panasonic G7 for $800 w/ a lens. That is like a GH4 lite and should meet most of your needs.

Colors:  Premiere Pro and your media player use hardware color conversion from your videocard (to convert the video's YUV colorspace into the RGB colorspace that your computer uses to display stuff).  The videocard is not really a precise machine for this conversion - not designed to be perfectly accurate.  When you view it on the web, there is a slightly different method for doing this conversion in the web browser.  The color red tends to be the most obvious culprit a lot of times.    This is why people need real video I/O equipment, a broadcast monitor, and the use of scopes to determine real colors.

If playbacks fine on my computer but once Youtube recompresses it, it looks awful. I tried uploading directly from the camera as well and it still happens.  I think the fault here is Youtube's compression and it really shows in scenes with too much reds/magentas, such as mine.  I'm at the point of currently trying to counterbalance my footage by adding a bit extra green/cyan and seeing if Youtube's compression and red/magenta shift will render it more or less neutral."

videography,3an939,bailsbackal,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:59:25 2015 UTC,The higher the bit rate the more data is available for video.
videography,3an939,Dcourtwreck,-1,Sun Jun 21 22:05:54 2015 UTC,does it improve quality of the video or no
videography,3an939,GenaricName,3,Sun Jun 21 22:28:23 2015 UTC,Yes it does. A higher bit rate will result in a closer representation of what the sensor is recording. Lower bit rates are more compressed and will generally be less sharp and have worse color.
videography,3an939,-PeterParker-,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:09:17 2015 UTC,"Along with the higher bitrate the GH3 also has a headphone input that the G7 does not, VERY important for monitoring audio."
videography,3an939,HybridCamRev,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:02:23 2015 UTC,"As /u/Dcourtwreck and /u/-PeterParker- have pointed out, the GH3 records at higher bit rates and has a headphone jack.  The GH3 also has a more robust, all-metal splash-resistant body, a wider variety of codec options, (to include Quicktime .mov in addition to the G7's AVCHD .mts) and it is fully compatible with batteries and other accessories for the GH4 (which will make it easier to upgrade at some point in the future).  Unless you really really need the $797.99 (with kit lens) G7's Ultra HD resolution, focus peaking or built-in intervalometer - for the same price (on sale, body-only), the GH3 seems to me to be a more capable DSLM.  Good luck with your decision and good luck with whichever camera you decide to buy!"

videography,3amu74,not_an_ax_murderer,6,Sun Jun 21 19:47:57 2015 UTC,you need a graduated nd filter
videography,3amu74,514SaM,2,Sun Jun 21 20:02:30 2015 UTC,"This is the answer.   A VND is essentially two polarized filters interacting with each other to create different densities.

ISO will prob have to be 400 if you're indoors, and assuming it's well lit.  With my C100 I ALWAYS shoot at 850 ISO because it's the sweet spot for colour grading.

Get a variable ND filter and lower your ISO. Try to keep your aperture at it's sweet spot for optimal sharpness. If you're shooting at 30fps don't lower your shutter speed below 1/60th. Set your creative filters to neutral if you intend to color correct in post.   Maybe you weren't talking about exposure though. So... 1080p? What settings are you asking about?   Weddings need to be bright and beautiful, so use highlights as a tool. Maybe over expose just a half stop. Light leaks may be annoying in film but for consumers and weddings they're great. Slow pans.

videography,3aiaty,Thermistor1,12,Sat Jun 20 13:21:35 2015 UTC,"You can think of it as a colour effect with very precise adjustments that you don't edit see... I mean you see the change in the footage but you don't edit he LUT yourself.   Sometimes they are used for taking your very flat footage shot in log mode and adding contrast and saturation to look ""normal.""   Sometimes they're used for emulating certain film stocks.   You typically add the LUT at the beginning of the grade to give you a base look to start with. Sometimes you add multiple. For example I have a set designed to emulate different film stocks, and then another set to emulate the different printing processes.   But in a total ELI5 way... Think of it as a colour preset."
videography,3aiaty,arthousedirector,5,Sat Jun 20 14:03:33 2015 UTC,"This needs to be upvoted more. The background of LUTs was originally to take very flat film scans that held all of the highlight and shadow detail that film could hold, and make it look normal. Or, to emulate on monitor what was going to happen to a video image once it was transferred to physical film.  After camera began to use flat log formats to store lots of info in a video image, they started to be used to make those flat images look normal for regular viewing.  So yes, ""Instagram filters"", but with a background of doing very very specific things to the image for tech reasons. Now people are just using them as grade presets, and that's fine. But they can be much more (or less) than that.  P.s. Stands for ""look up table"". Read a specific color value, look it up (in a table) to change it to another specific color value. Repeat roughly 36,000 times per frame."
videography,3aiaty,Maxgirth,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:12:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks, having that context is very helpful. It is hard to find consensus on using LUTs from forums so understanding its original function is helpful."
videography,3aiaty,Maxgirth,2,Sun Jun 21 02:20:25 2015 UTC,"People get confused, because they're using them to take like a flat Blackmagic Film image and make it look normal. If you haven't played with them much, you might think the LUT is just adding X amount of contrast and saturation. But since a LUT can literally take any color/brightness value and do anything to it, the reality is that the look of how overexposure, and color reproduction is rendered CAN be tied up in the LUT.   Early Sony Slog LUTs were literally just gamma transforms, and made no effort to put the colors from the sensor into Rec709 nicely. They also took any value over X brightness that the sensor recorded (important highlight detail) and just mapped it to 100% white. A hard, digital clip. It looked terrible, because it was a LUT created by an engineer using nothing but math curves and zero regard with how to take that highlight detail that was technically outside the 800% brightness range Rec709 is limited in reproduction, and just threw away important sensor info required to make a pretty highlight roll off.   Later Sony realized they could truly compete with the Alexa with the F55, F5 by taking all that info crated by their great sensor, and just transforming the data to match Alexa Rec709 output using, you guessed it, a LUT used in post. You can thank Redditor /u/ArtAdamsDP for steering Sony in the right direction. It took just that LUT to transform the role of those cameras in the marketplace."
videography,3aiaty,ArtAdamsDP,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:02:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that LUT made a difference. It's not perfect, but it's really good.  I've been playing around with an app called LutCalc allows you to tweak prebuilt LUTs further. Google it, it's free and very useful."
videography,3aiaty,AShavedApe,5,Sun Jun 21 19:02:56 2015 UTC,"All the people commenting aren't wrong but there's some very important stuff to add.   A Look Up Table basically takes certain colors and adjusts them to other colors. You can absolutely color grade AND correct with them but this process isn't the same. Generally, you want to correct your image before ever applying a LUT stylistically. You need to know that your footage actually matches the rest of your stuff and that your footage isn't wonky. Also, certain LUTs for REC709 or BM footage and stuff should be applied for color correction before the grade. There's an order and a purpose to each step and it should be known and used accordingly. Not simply as an Instagram look."
videography,3aiaty,PastramiSwissRye,3,Sat Jun 20 15:24:11 2015 UTC,"It's a preset with a fancy name. I use LUTs in three ways. At the beginning of correction process I use one to take my flat-to-preserve-detail image 90% of the way to a reasonably-contrasty-and-saturated image. I tweak the next 5% manually and ignore the final 5% because it takes the longest. The second way I use one is to simulate a film stock after I've corrected but before I've graded. Sometimes a film stock suits things so well I don't bother grading.  It's helpful to slap a LUT on an image before you let your producer see it. Producers by their nature are imaginationless creatures. The LUT gives them confidence.  In regards to applying a LUT to your workflow, I put my correction LUT on the final node of my tree in Davinci Resolve. This way all my changes happen as close to the detailed original image as possible, but I get to view them all through the pre-work that the LUT can do for me. I put my grade/film stock LUT on a timeline node so it gets applied to all of my clips consistently."

I'm using a gh4 currently and there seem to be two schools of thought as to whether you should try to flatten the image when shooting to get all the high and low detail, or shoot as close to the final as possible so you don't compress the most crucial aspects of the picture and exaggerate noise in the mids. I'm trying to find what the best approach is.  Edit: to be clear. Gh4 doesn't shoot raw."
videography,3aiaty,CwrwCymru,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:25:54 2015 UTC,"It depends on the project.

However, the main problem is probably what you write in the title here. It's a ""quick"" promo. Real fashion advertising usually isn't quick and dirty. It's meticulously planned and extremely well polished. I as a viewer can't avoid comparing it to ""a real"" fashion video shoot, and in comparison it looks very amateurish.

videography,3ahte0,hipomino,2,Sat Jun 20 09:49:58 2015 UTC,"Well thank you for your honest opinion. I say ""quick"" promo because I was there shooting this model for the photography without a plan whatsoever to shoot video. Last minute they wanted it done that same day. So, with a warning to them of ZERO pre-production, I couldn't guarantee it would be great. So that's exatcly what I did. Went around the lawn of the mansion we were shooting at, took a few clips (Without any of my video gear with me other than using my Canon 5D MkIII) and later made it into what I could with what little time I had to do it. There are absolutely errors made while shooting as well as post production. But thanks, and I appreciate your honesty. With proper pre-production planning this video would not exist. lol"
videography,3ahte0,hipomino,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:56:42 2015 UTC,There is a flash of black @0:12. seems a bit sloppy to miss that.   The lighting wasn't that great. Outside you should have used shade more to avoid those harsh shadows. Inside was way too dark. You should have put the window to her side not behind her.

videography,3ahte0,PastramiSwissRye,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:55:58 2015 UTC,"The lighting indoors could use some work to be brighter tonhelp match the outdoor scenes and fit the vibe of a fun adventurous summer day. My gripe with the shots at :13 and :20 is that they just look plain.  At :13 all i can see is that plain grey wall and at :20 too much sky takes up the frame and the backround is a bit dull. I do enjoy most of the other shots because they're punched in a bit closer and have complex backrounds or at least dont tell me too much avout where I am. It lets the imagination roam a bit and keeps me interestd in the ad. I do enjoy the last shot though and music is good, title style I'm still not sure on. The idea is good, keep working at it!"

videography,3ahte0,David_Tosk,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:20:06 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed what you did with the text, though the font was a curious choice and it did seem a bit small in some spots.  Timing seemed pretty good for the cuts, but the pace of the actual footage didn't quite match the music.  Color grading looked great. Brightness and contrast was a little off, maybe the problem was the lack of variety or the lighting on the model (she seems to blend with the background).  Not sure why you went with :41, seems like :30 would be more usable for something they might want to use on television. Don't make your footage match your music, make your whole composition match a predetermined time.  The outro seems slow. Even though it's a short piece, I want to stop watching after :28 or :29. Thats good if you can tighten it up because you can make it a standard commercial length."

Here it is pictured with my GH3.  That said, for your shooting style, I think you're making the right decision to look at a camcorder instead of a mirrorless camera.  And if you want to ""buy once, buy right"" in 2015, you probably want an Ultra HD ""4K"" camera.  But I don't think you need to spend almost $2000 for an AX100.  For your style of shooting, I think you can save yourself some money by considering the $898 (on sale) AX33.  You probably don't need the AX100's larger sensor and higher bit rates for recording trucks in daylight.  Here's what this camera can do:   Sabrina hooping to Water Lily in 4k UHD (wide shot is with the AX33) Pittsburgh Winter 2015 Sony FDR-AX33  ""It's 13:22"" - Sony FDR AX33 (prototype model) first look   The AX33 is the highest resolution camcorder with a viewfinder below $1000 and is a very good value for your money.

He drives 2 hours and captures the day beautifully and then can not get in contact with the guy for a long period of time and catches on then googles to find out that the guy has a criminal history. The videographer eventually came to terms with the wedding planner + bride and groom and said he would edit and give them all of the footage for $500 as he didn't want to keep it hostage, but still wanted compensation - they loved it so much they paid him $700 instead, gave him a great review and and is recommending him for their friends' weddings.

In my contract I state that a percentage (Depends really on the cost) has to be paid 14 days prior to the Wedding, any cancellations on their end after that point result in no return of the deposit, as I've already put time aside from them.

With this setup, you'll have a camcorder with built-in power zoom lens, rock solid optical steady shot image stabilization, a professional 10-bit 4:2:2 codec, SDI out, a relatively large 1"" sensor - plus pro audio and video wrapped up in one package.  Walking shots in this travel piece are an example of what the X70 can do: San Blas Islands of Panama. December 2014.  Here it is intercut with the GH4 in an indoor single musician live performance: Chris August sings The Maker  It's also a good exterior B roll camera, as seen here: NYC Stock Footage using the PXW-X70  In my view, the X70's robust, broadcast-ready 10-bit codec and optical steady shot system make it a best choice in this price class.  Alternatively, if you need simpler controls, you can get the X70's consumer-level little brother, the $1598 Sony FDR-AX100.  This camera has built in Ultra High Definition (""4K"") recording (the X70 is ""UHD ready"", but requires a paid upgrade).  Here is what the AX100 can do:   A piece of Art and Soul-Shot on Sony AX100   Here is a nice review of the camera with its new 100mbps firmware upgrade from Johnnie Behiri: https://www.cinema5d.com/sony-ax100-review-4k-100-mbps-firmware/  Sadly, you would need a $598 XLR adapter to plug pro XLR mics into this camera.

Why did I leave out prime lenses?  Because they are only good when you have an entire set to cover the whole focal length range from wide to long.

Is there someway to automatically apply the effect to every clip from that source in the sequence without changing the original file?   It seems like the master setting alters the original file, with the benefit of updating all instances in the sequence. The test setting preserves the original file but only applies to the selected clip. I'd really like something in between those."
videography,3acqtm,fistasista,4,Fri Jun 19 03:22:26 2015 UTC,"I just tested. Once you make changes to the master file it automatically applies those changes to every other clip of that same file/source in your timeline. You can then make changes to individual clips if you want, but the master modification will always be there on every clip. New clips from that source added to the timeline after the master adjustment will also keep the changes.  It's really how you're supposed to work when applying your modifications to every clip from that source. You're not altering your original file, you're just linking metadata changes to your source."
videography,3acqtm,bardomudo,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:14:26 2015 UTC,Ah cheers! My interpretation was that it was making actual changes to the original file. If it's just making changes within the project then that will work fine for me.

videography,3afgw4,eysun,2,Fri Jun 19 18:26:23 2015 UTC,What are you trying to say? There's no story. Interview someone about Detroit. A person speaking about what were looking at would help
videography,3afgw4,Fivell50,0,Fri Jun 19 21:46:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks for putting time out of your day to watch and comment. So first I have to say that I am a complete amateur in videography and editing.   The main theme of these series is modern videography of the city of Detroit and ordinary people along my taste of music. I did not intend to necessarily have a story to tell, but more of engaging with the audience through the music and matching visuals. My goal for making these are mainly to learn editing, framing, color correction etc. so thats where Im looking for your comments.   I also want to say that I dont have professional gear, most of my shots are taken on a GoPro camera or my iPhone 5s. I do this all for fun and personal interest, so this is not my job by any means. Once Im confident enough in my skills, I will start investing more money and time to possibly making actual movies with a story to tell.   Again thank you watching and your comment!"
videography,3afgw4,Fivell50,0,Fri Jun 19 22:53:35 2015 UTC,BTW this is a link to the first video of the same series which I made a month ago: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWVdhriw5iU  It's hard to get people watch your videos on the internet these days since people have such short attention span. So having actual professionals giving tips on my work is a gem Im still looking for.
videography,3aaz2a,henryhorker,2,Thu Jun 18 17:06:36 2015 UTC,I want one. And I don't even have a camera or anything to use with it.

videography,3aamqt,weezel,3,Thu Jun 18 17:05:20 2015 UTC,It looks like it was shot on an iPhone. Color grading seemed to bounce around as well.
videography,3aamqt,weezel,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:15:24 2015 UTC,Is it recommended to keep consistent color grading?
videography,3aamqt,SirCrest_YT,2,Thu Jun 18 22:43:16 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't even go that far. First, the Iphone has such heavy compression already. I would just colour correct it if needed. Second, some of the shots have a random vignette applied to them. I believe consistency is key in short videos like this. Throwing random effects and different colouring makes it look less professional. Last, the Iphone has the sharpness of a potato. I would be interested in seeing something you edit with better video quality."
videography,3acrvq,dinozords,3,Fri Jun 19 01:34:13 2015 UTC,This might be a really obvious solution but are you sure the audio isn't switched to an external mic? Switches on the top handle. Plus as previously mentioned could be settings in the camera.
videography,3acrvq,ImLyno,2,Fri Jun 19 08:21:59 2015 UTC,Have you checked your in camera audio settings?
videography,3acrvq,Imposter12345,2,Fri Jun 19 05:21:19 2015 UTC,"Agreed. This could be a very simple thing, on both counts. I haven't actually laid hands on the C100, but I do know that most professional cameras have options for disabling the record light."
videography,3acrvq,Kichigai,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:56:26 2015 UTC,If the light on the top is not turning on it sounds like a problem with the top handle. Did you make sure there was a solid connection between the top handle and the port? Are you able to start/stop the camera using the top handle? A new top handle will cost you $535 plus tax and shipping from Canon. Hopefully the camera is still under warranty!

videography,3aalg1,muederJoe,6,Thu Jun 18 15:26:11 2015 UTC,"Sadly, neither of your Sonys will record for more than 30 minutes continuously, so you will have to restart them with about 10 minutes to go.    You can avoid gaps with B-roll from the second camera or by staggering the start times.  As far as low light goes, the A7s is pretty much a ""see-in-the-dark"" camera, so put the 70-200 on it, crank the ISO and put it at the back of the theater (perhaps with the camcorder on a tripod next to it as a backup).  Then put one of your fast lenses on the A6000 and handhold it near the front for B-roll.  You should be able to get pretty good coverage and decent exposure with this setup.  Hope this is helpful and hope your kids have a great show!"

videography,3a9xa6,IronTek,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:30:01 2015 UTC,"I will say, your first purchase is the biggest investment.  If you buy a GH4 today, you can always resell it in 7-8 months (not 6, in retrospect) when the GH5 will likely be available.  Any loss from the sale is like you would be renting the GH4 for a while."

videography,3a9xa6,HybridCamRev,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:41:43 2015 UTC,You may want to look into saving up a bit more and pairing it with a metabones speed booster. I've only heard positive things about it.

You need a Quadro to use 10bit in most professional applications.  Don't buy AMD for video work - They can't do CUDA, and their OpenGL/OpenCL implementation is slower and less featured than Nvidia.

videography,3aaybn,kaidumo,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:03:22 2015 UTC,You work at GoPro? How did you get the job? (I ask because that is one of my dream jobs) This is my YouTube channel where I produce a lot of GoPro vids.
videography,3aaybn,kaidumo,2,Thu Jun 18 17:53:10 2015 UTC,Well I started 3 years ago and the company was quite a bit different then. I had been working as a videographer in action sports and broadcast for about 7 years at that point. I had a lot of contacts in the industry and one happened to be at GoPro. They had an opening and it turned out that my experience and skill set fit the needs of the company. It's a bit more corporate now but knowing people always helps. Networking is always half the battle. The best thing you can do is keep making videos and always strive to learn and get better. Always check our gopro.com/careers page for openings.
videography,3a5f8p,AnchorLineNH,8,Wed Jun 17 11:01:12 2015 UTC,I like to scale the image at the jump cut to make it look like a two camera shoot. Probably one of the best examples for wanting a 4K camera.
videography,3a5f8p,rdz1986,5,Wed Jun 17 15:16:47 2015 UTC,I do this with my A7S... the 1080p footage is so good on that camera that you can scale it up to 150% without having a very noticeable drop in quality. Works a treat for corporate work.

I've been debating between the GH4 and A7S for a while, the color space and low light being the draw of the A7S and internal 4K for digital motion in post being the draw of the GH4 since I can't afford a Shogun. I'm leaning more heavily towards the A7S now that I know it offers similar scalability, thanks."
videography,3a5f8p,Strottinglemon,3,Thu Jun 18 10:15:01 2015 UTC,Yeah I worried about that to but went with the A7S. I don't have a shogun yet and had a particularly annoying corporate video to edit so I figured why not try digital reframing with 1080p. It was a very pleasant surprise to find it worked!  You will have to sharpen any footage you scale up though as they wont match how crisp the unscaled footage will look.

My subject was sitting still and there was no background movement. She paused in between parts I wanted to cut, and there was still a noticeable wonk to it.  I think it could be really great sometimes, but it's kind of a crapshoot and you can't rely on it.   However, I think it's still useful even if it doesn't hide the cut 100%.

Seriously, this product is a sham.   As to your question: They recommend using tungsten because it doesn't require a ballast like an HMI or other types of bulbs would. You stick an HMI bulb in there and you'll have a bad time. It's mostly a CYA thing by the company for people who try to cut corners. If you read the description however,  it tells you that this is a traditional porcelain socket  (like your typical household bulbs go into). This means you're able to use any porcelain style bulb,  whatever its kelvin rating is. The unit will provide power and shouldn't affect the color.

Optically it's just as good as the Metabones if not a little sharper and it's only $130. No special features though.   GH4+RJ Speedbooster is an absolute win in my eyes. It becomes a Super 35mm equivalent with an added stop of light sensitivity and it opens up the possibility of using hundreds more lenses than the 6D.  The GH4 is also a very good stills camera so you won't be losing out on that front.   6D has a terrible codec for video and in the long run you will really regret it when you can get something much better for a little more.

For that price, you will get 4 times the resolution of the 6D, almost zero moire, 96fps slow motion, a headphone jack, a viewfinder that actually works while you're shooting video, the ability to record for hours continuously if you need to and image quality that looks like this:  Narrative   Without You Intersect A Fine Dining Experience Siren Storm Writer's Block Out of Time   Travel   Union Glacier Postcard from Phang Na   Documentary   Seize the Day   96fps Slow Motion   Paris SlowMotion (Vintage Lenses) Kaydara (Anamorphic GH4)   Music Video   Little Tybee - ""Don't Quit Your Day Job"" at Doppler Studios   It's a pretty good still camera too (not as good as the 6D, but pretty darned good): https://www.flickr.com/groups/gh4/pool/  My vote would be for the GH4.

videography,39zbdp,bardomudo,7,Tue Jun 16 00:28:11 2015 UTC,most larger production houses doing factual content usually edit in an avid codec on a 14:1 compression ratio across a network with a massive 8 disk+ server. This gives them pretty high throughputs via a SAS or iscsi or whatever protocol they use but also a large array has acceptable seek time. The issue is 100% your drive speed. Short of getting a RAID5 array you're going to have a REALLY hard time with conventional HDD because just your seek time scrubbing to access 8 simultaneous file is almost unfeasible.   A hard drive is just a series of spinning platters with a single head that reads off of them. If you are editing off a single drive there is at most 4 spinning platters and 4 heads that can only be in 4 places at one time. Soon as you start to access 8 files simultaneously those heads that do the reading now have to jump all over the place to access the data from all 8 files. This is creating very bad drive latency.   My recommendation would be to compress it and throw it on a cheaper SSD RAID0 with usb 3.0 access or take a hit and do an external RAID 5 SAS array which would be a good investment for your future if you plan on doing something similar again or are going to move to 4K.   Hope this helps

videography,39wy90,RizzoFromDigg,0,Tue Jun 16 02:07:55 2015 UTC,"Huh, I thought trying to shoot high res on slower cards caused all kinds of problems?  Though now that I think about it I'm not sure where or when I heard it.  May very well have been ten years ago when 512MB cards were the new hotness.  Edit: Where are you seeing a 32gb 80mb/sec sandisk card for $21? Closest I can see right now is a 32gb 60mb/sec for $31. Maybe I'm looking in the wrong places  Edit secundus: Okay I found a Sandisk extreme plus 32gb 80mb/sec card but it is for $53 on amazon.ca.  Bestbuy has them listed for $89, the same as the normal price for the Sony.  I suppose I should clarify that I am referring to Canadian dollars, I suspect you may be using American dollars, which could explain the price difference."
videography,39wy90,RizzoFromDigg,5,Mon Jun 15 15:49:22 2015 UTC,"Your first point, shooting high res on slower cards causing problems:  The common misconception here is the difference between megabits and megabytes. Cameras list their bitrates in megabits per second but the cards are sold in terms of megabytes per second. My Panasonic GH4 can shoot 4K video at 200 megabits per second, but that's only 25 megaBYTES per second. Well below the speed of any good SD card.  So yes, I need to make sure my SD card is fast enough, but not 94MB/sec fast.  In the case of this particular card, its heavily discounted from a ridiculous price to a slightly less ridiculous price. Or at least that was my initial thought. I realize now you're talking Canadian dollars and Canadian pricing with taxes, which is of course a factor.  So on the hand I'm glad I helped you better understand SD card speeds, but yeah, it's a Canadian vs. American pricing disparity."

So is there actually any camera out there that does need 94MB/sec write speed?  Those super slow-motion 10,000FPS  cameras or something?  Or is it mostly just unnecessary excess capacity?  Don't the really high end cameras use their own proprietary storage cards?"
videography,39wy90,RizzoFromDigg,2,Mon Jun 15 18:04:10 2015 UTC,"I can't think of a camera that shoots to SD cards that would need this speed of SD card.

videography,39y408,MacintoshEddie,7,Mon Jun 15 19:22:43 2015 UTC,"Consumer camcorder's internal clocks aren't accurate. Each camera has its own signal generator keeping time, and since none of them are 100% accurate or synchronized with each other, you won't get consistent time across different cameras.  Even professional ENG cameras - if synched up through timecode alone - will slip a few seconds if left running long enough. Systems like Genlock are used in timing-critical applications to ensure that camera timecodes remain consistant across the board.  You should not expect a consumer camcorder to keep accurate time - they are not scientific instruments. If it takes a few nanoseconds longer to compress a frame than expected, its synch will drift.  What you need to do is work out which camera is most accurate, and then timescale the remainder of the clips appropriately."

videography,39y6wb,paross,2,Mon Jun 15 19:28:12 2015 UTC,"Sadly, the Canon T2i, T3i, 7D, 60D and 5D Mark II are all done after about 12 minutes.  Other Canon cameras can record continuously for 30 minutes, but even that can be too short at some weddings.  For longer continuous recording times, you will need a camcorder or a Panasonic DSLM.  If you want over an hour of continuous recording plus video images that look like this:  Wedding  http://vimeo.com/107366816  http://vimeo.com/104542323  ...you might want to consider a $515 Panasonic G6 with the 14-42mm kit lens.  I upgraded from a T2i to Panasonic cameras, and was very happy to have a viewfinder and autofocus that actually worked while I was shooting video.  1080/60p for smooth slow motion and hours of continuous recording (instead of minutes) were a nice bonus.  The best part, though, was the improvement in image quality.  Panasonic G and GH cameras are far less susceptible to moire than my T2i was.  With a $30 adapter, you can continue to use your EF (but not your EF-S) lenses in manual mode.  Hope this is helpful and good luck with your upgrade!"

More if I save that and take on a couple weddings or something."
videography,39y6wb,redonculous,3,Mon Jun 15 20:03:15 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I would do some more gigs and save up for a full frame camera.  A 6D or a 5D would be a meaningful upgrade, and would be worth saving for.  600 won't get you too much more beyond your t2i's specs, and if it were me, I'd wait a little longer until you have the money.  I'm actually in process of getting the money to upgrade my t3i.  Anything besides full frame isn't going to be worth the money."

videography,39y6wb,Nidty719,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:22:40 2015 UTC,"In that case, try to get something with XLR inputs. It's a pretty good sign of a more professional camera.

videography,39ue4g,David_Tosk,2,Mon Jun 15 03:48:45 2015 UTC,This has to be related to the FS7 though.
videography,39ue4g,_Shush,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:54:36 2015 UTC,Yes pretty much the majority of why. Other reasons are...    Sony's Mirrorless line are becoming more popular for video then their camcorders (besides the FS7) The Fs700 and FS100 are old cameras Sony's newly announced cameras have Tech specs that rival the FS700 for a lower price   Non of the reasons are why the fs700 is simply a Super 35 camcorder.

videography,39ue4g,teawhy,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:16:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, ""decent quality"" is a fairly subjective term - although I'm still at a loss for what else to call it. I have a Hero4 Black and the slow motion leaves much to be desired - lots of aliasing and very noisy in the shadows. It is a small step up from the overcranked options on an iPhone. The 240fps footage from the FS700 is still quite a bit better than either.  I agree that AVCHD isn't much these days, but from an aesthetic perspective the FS700 still seems the best-in-class for slow motion at that price point, but the footage I've seen from the new cameras you mentioned do show promise. Hopefully that technology ""trickles up"" (?) to the higher end cameras."
videography,39ue4g,ScreamingPenguin,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:13:21 2015 UTC,Does anyone know if this is still the cheapest way to get 240fps at decent quality?   It is not.

videography,39ue4g,OneOfTheWills,1 point,Mon Jun 15 11:31:07 2015 UTC,"These do not do 960fps at 1080p.  They do 800x270 or 1136x384 at 960fps and 1824x1026 or 1676x566 at 240fps.  There is also a crop factor going on where it takes the center portion of the sensor the higher you go in frame rate.  I think they look fantastic and definitely have their uses, but might not really be competition for the fs700 at a clean 1920x1080 240fps.

The G6 is a large sensor, interchangeable lens camera that will give you better interview image quality than a conventional camcorder in this price range.  Like a camcorder, this camera can record for hours continuously, has lenses with silent autofocus motors, has built-in manual audio gain control to manage preamp noise - plus an electronic viewfinder that keeps working while you're shooting video.  Here are a couple of videos with segments showing what this camera can do in an interview setting:   Mick Buencamino is RNDV  Just Action - Behind The Scenes of Jamaican Filmmaking   It's a pretty good still camera too: https://www.flickr.com/groups/lumix-g6/pool/  If $515 exceeds your budget limit, you might want to consider the Panasonic FZ200 instead.  The $376 Panasonic FZ200 is a great interview camera, with an external mic jack, fast autofocus, a constant f2.8 low light zoom lens and a flip forward LCD so you can see yourself.  Here is what it can do:   Great camera for YouTube marketers: Lumix FZ200 camera   One caveat: as Marlene mentioned in the video, it has a 2.5mm mic jack, so you'll need a $1 adapter to plug standard mics into it.  I have this camera's predecessor, the FZ150 (pictured here with an external mic), and these cameras are a good value for your money.

A ride that could've taken a morning took most of the day trying to stop and balance the camera etc etc it was a lot of stop and starting but it's fine trying to get creative working with what you have around you. The trick to getting steady shot's on the bike was using a lens with IS and then also keeping the camera strap taught around your neck by pulling the camera tight which helped to keep it MUCH steadier and lastly by slowing the footage down it also helps to smoothen out the little bumps ;) There was A LOT of unusable bumpy footage haha. The one super low shot was a sneaky one, that's where I had parked to had my glidecam and got that shot otherwise every other shot was hand held.

If you're looking to emulate a two monitor workspace, it probably won't be as nice as having two monitors, as the aspect ratio of each half is only a hair wider than square, but it would be better than a single 16:9 monitor.   I'm unsure about the curvature. At this point, it seems a little gimmicky and may come at the cost of the image. I don't know how different the picture is from a flat screen, but that might be a consideration as you edit; most people won't have curved monitors.  Again, I haven't worked with a curved screen, so I'm speaking purely from conjecture. The width would probably be fine, though."

videography,39sb9w,leadfinger0,8,Sun Jun 14 07:26:44 2015 UTC,"Hi /u/leadfinger0 - I am a big Panasonic fan. I recommend their cameras often and I own all four cameras in their GH line (seen here) - but, if it fits your budget, I recommend the $2499.99 (with 16-50mm f2.0-2.8 zoom lens) NX1 over the $1098 (with 14-140mm manual zoom) G7.  Here's why:   the NX1 offers 1080/120p slow motion - the G7 maxes out at 1080/60p the NX1 has a headphone jack for monitoring what you're recording - the G7 does not the NX1 has an APS-C sized sensor, which makes it easier to get shallow depth of field the NX1 takes higher resolution still photographs (28.2MP vs 16MP for the G7) the NX1records video at a maximum 4K resolution of 4096x2160 (the G7 is limited to 3840x2160 UHD)   Here is what the NX1 can do:  120fps slow motion  http://vimeo.com/123891042  http://vimeo.com/128103804  http://vimeo.com/118529486  Dialogue/Narrative  http://vimeo.com/121238971  http://vimeo.com/112974046  Travel  http://vimeo.com/117027464  http://vimeo.com/114834209  http://vimeo.com/114857409  Promo  http://vimeo.com/127142220  Landscapes  http://vimeo.com/124287295  http://vimeo.com/126319495  Documentary  http://vimeo.com/117699725  Skate  http://youtu.be/52lMGLqfTuc   http://vimeo.com/119624019  It's a great still camera too, with a 15fps continuous frame rate. Here's the still image quality you can get from this 28.2MP camera: Flickr Samsung NX1 Pool  You can use the free RockyMountains Movie Converter (http://sourceforge.net/p/rockymountainsmovieconverter/wiki/Home/) to transcode the h.265 footage from the NX1 to ProRes or h.264 for editing.  To be fair, the G7 does have a couple of advantages over the NX1:   the G7 can record video for over an hour continuously, while the NX1 has a 30 minute continuous video recording limit (after 30 minutes, you have to hit the record button, which causes a gap in long recordings - this can be a problem if you ever want to record a speech, sermon, play, graduation or other long event) the G7 is compatible with the Metabones Speed Booster as well as their Smart Adapter - which gives it electronic compatibility with Canon lenses. No similar adapter is available for the NX1   Hope this is helpful and, whatever you decide, good luck with your new camera!"

If I were getting started again, I would probably find a more established videographer or small production house and try to get a gig being a 2nd videographer or assistant.  You'll get to see how a professional interacts with the client, what type of jobs are out there, what is involved, how the pro works payments and the editing process.    In the meantime, go to small business meetups in your area and offer small businesses your services (and learn about business).  You'll get some experience working for clients.  Some of the people there are cheap - like people with etsy type crafts businesses, but it's good to get experience and a basic networking.  That person's husband or friend might work for a bigger company and need some video.  At some point though, you should focus on a type of client you want to pursue.  Doing ""all kinds"" of videos is an inefficient way to network and market.  It's all about the network eventually."
videography,39r0q3,averynicehat,1 point,Sat Jun 13 23:08:19 2015 UTC,"This is spot on for me.  I finished my course, got an apprenticeship in a small production company. I'm now his number 2 and working fulltime for him, learning his ways, professionalism etc.  He gets his work from business networking groups as you mentioned. Lots of referrals and things like that.   I'd start maybe doing some 60 second profile clips for friends businesses and things like that if you know anyone. Simple enough to do by yourself if you have gear, some creative freedom and covers things like interviews, getting good footage and working with whatever youve got on the day to dealing with the client relationship and business side of things start to finish.  So outside of that I've been picking up my own jobs doing music gigs and things like that, being what im most interested in videography wise. This is picking up for me as I get better from learning in my day job, then other bands see what i've done and want in on that.. few referrals jobs there too.   I'm still in the early days and doing mostly cash in hand jobs and learning how to do it by the book."

I interned/PA'd/freelanced with a bigger production company in town  I produced corporate work for nonprofits at an extremely low price.  It took 2 years before I could quit my job and do this full time but I absolutely could have done it faster. 2 weddings, 2 corps, and 2 narrative shorts are enough to make a kickass demo reel and you can knock those out over the summer on weekends easy."

Once you know what you want to do, take crap jobs working for people who do what you want to do. As good as you think you are, you'll quickly discover they are way better than you are, because experience. Learn for a few years before striking out on your own.   No one wants an editor/videographer/interviewer/VFX artist/motion graphics person. If you're just starting out they won't believe that you do any of that well, because each one is a specific skill set. Producers are generally looking for a person who does one of those spectacularly. Maybe over time they'll trust that you can do two of those, but only once they know you.

I'm not sure exactly what you're seeing, but power is supplied to light fixtures in a slightly different way between the U.S. And Europe.  In the U.S., alternating current oscillates at a rate of 60hz, and in Europe at 50hz. This is the entire purpose behind NTSC and PAL formats (respectively). At the time that standards were being developed for television, A/C oscillation was used to control frame rate.  Skipping a bunch of history: This is how we've landed on a 29.97 FPS standard in the U.S., and 25 FPS in Europe; the reason why lighting fixtures oscillate at different speeds, and possibly why you're seeing a subtle difference in lighting character between these two countries.   To beat this horse a little more, lighting fixtures actually flicker and such a fast rate that it's almost invisible to human eyes. It shows up when stop-motion is shot (it's that flicker that you often see happening in shitty YouTube stop motion). Professional stop-motion artists use special lights with capacitors built in to smooth out the flickers to avoid this.  So I could imagine it being possible that a difference in character as a result of differing A/C rates would be visible, to someone that was looking for it.  Tl;dr: you may be seeing changes in lighting character as a result between the different electrical standards used in the U.S. and Europe: A/C at 60hz and 50hz."

videography,39qn77,agills,2,Sun Jun 14 04:29:35 2015 UTC,"If you want a small lightweight camera with a great image out of camera with little post work... go with a c100m1  If you want all that plus a viewfinder that doesn't have a blue tint, 60p, and a better image with slightly more Dr... go with a c100m2  If you want a larger camera with better codecs, more Dr, more latitude with grading, super slow motion, and 4k... go with an fs7. The thing about that however is you will spend a lot off extra money on cards making it now of a $10,000 camera"
videography,39qn77,capri_stylee,0,Sun Jun 14 06:28:11 2015 UTC,"The A7s, it'd be my choice because I feel it can handle great event stuff for it's price. Won't need the Ninja Blade, could get a Shogun maybe.  Main reason is it's low light handling and price (with Metabones Adaptor). Depending on your events I'd say it can get run and gun, and you may not always be able to depend on the light.   Although if you still think the C100 MkII is top stuff, reply because I'd wonder if I'm missing something.  Edit: People saying the XLR inputs are brilliant, which they are. I like using a Zoom H6 or similar for events, so using some sort of DSLR in a cage plus that suit me down to the ground. Having it all in one is one route, it's still cheaper to use the Sony with other bits and bobs - but is the C100 Mkii's pre-amp decent? I'd imagine it is, so if you wanted the best possible audio available without syncing up in post, the C100 would offer more."
videography,39qn77,agills,9,Sat Jun 13 20:46:23 2015 UTC,"I want to agree with you, but for events, having all the built-in stuff on a c100 would be useful, like the ND filters and the audio capabilities (xlr's). I use an a7s every day, and while I love the tiny form factor, I wouldn't mind bulk if it had some ""pro"" features built in. Thoughts?"
videography,39qn77,benenke,9,Sat Jun 13 21:23:16 2015 UTC,"As someone who has been shooting events with a 7D for the last few years, there's absolutely no way I'd recommend upgrading from a DSLR to another DSLR (or mirrorless etc). Having XLRs and built in NDs on the cameras I rent makes life so much easier, they instantly relegate the 7d to B roll, despite the quality of its footage."
videography,39qn77,brazilliandanny,3,Sat Jun 13 21:27:27 2015 UTC,"That's pretty much what I was thinking. I shoot weddings, and having a small form factor is important to me since I'm following the bride and groom all day. Gear is heavy! ha. If I shot different types of events, I wouldn't be using a mirrorless."
videography,39qn77,_Shush,2,Sat Jun 13 21:30:25 2015 UTC,"My thoughts exactly. We're already on 5D's and despite the great image quality, I thought a C100 would be able to offer more."
videography,39qn77,CoolDudesJunk,2,Sun Jun 14 03:58:25 2015 UTC,"Came here to say this. No headaches using a C100, which means you can focus on what matters most - telling your story."

I've shot with the original RX10, and the only thing it was missing (when compared to its closest competitor, the Panasonic FZ1000)  was high frame rates and Ultra HD resolution. The RX10 II fixes that.  The only downside for the RX cameras, in my view, is the 30 minute continuous recording limit (the HF G30 has it beat there).  If you can wait, I recommend you seriously consider preordering this camera for $1298 on June 17th.  Hope this is helpful and good luck!"
videography,39rknv,HybridCamRev,2,Sun Jun 14 02:39:04 2015 UTC,I'm gonna second that notion. RX10 ii pretty much owns house on the G30 in every way. Though I would probably personally be looking more into large format sensor cameras.

Anything shorter should NOT be cheaper because it's still tying up your day and preventing you from taking a longer gig. Track your own hours on projects - it's helpful to be able to tell someone how long it takes you to edit 1 minute of interview, montage, motion graphics, etc. Finally the hardest part - pick hourly rates for your personal time. This varies by market. Shoot for something at least 1.5x minimum wage but hopefully higher based on your experience. It often makes sense to have two rates, a shooting rate and an editing rate. My shooting rate is higher because I have to wear pants and be sober.   I'm not saying this is the only way to do it, but it's how I bill for freelance gigs."

videography,39payq,SavvyStereo,1 point,Sat Jun 13 18:43:08 2015 UTC,"I'm still in early days of this kind of work. I've made friends with a dude that runs a small label. He's gotten me to make promos and music clips for a couple of his rostered bands so they were my first paid jobs. Hell, I was filming a show on the weekend and it was a release show for one of his bands. As they were setting up and I was packing up after filming the band I came for, he came and asked me to go film their set and make it into a clip, so i picked up a job while on a job.   From that work I've caught the attention of some other bands who want that kind of thing to promote their music. So you've got 5 members in a band, they all share the video of them, it can spread pretty quickly through their networks, I work mainly in punk/hardcore scenes since I play in a couple bands too, so that helps in meeting more people in my target market.   One band got in touch from a referral, I filmed them, they dug it and want to do more together like interviews and putting together footage for a 10yr anniv. DVD so that's cool.   My rates are cheap as I reckon. I'd charge $200 to go to a local show, film the set and cut the footage to an mp3.

The audio stuff is now our main focus as I've been spending a lot on getting the camera ready. Right now, the recorder is the H6, which is capable, but the shotgun mic we're using is subpar (azden smg-x1). We're looking into getting either a Sennheiser MKH416 or an Rode NTG-3.

It will be hard to beat the V770 for features and image quality unless you step up to an interchangeable lens camera such as the $599.95 Panasonic G6 with the 14-42mm power zoom lens.  This camera loses the V770's headphone jack and 120fps, but gains other features the V770 lacks - such as a viewfinder, a built-in intervalometer for timelapse videos, a larger sensor and more flexible lens selection.  The viewfinder makes it much easier to shoot video outdoors in bright sunlight (when the V770's LCD is likely to be washed out).

The important thing is taking time to formulate the important shots that support the structure of the video, then fill it out from there.

videography,39kyiv,whutchamacallit,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:37:01 2015 UTC,"With denoising a lot can be forgiven, especially with carefully thought out testing and total control of lighting.  The GH4 is a great camera for many things, just not low light and I was shocked at how poorly it performed against my 5DIII given I had heard so little (if anything) about this severe limitation.   If you're shooting controlled stuff, go for it and work with the limitations (like the crop). If you're doing anything more lively and you're not in control of lighting, prepare for a surprise.  If anything I would rent it and take it on a real world gig for a b camera (or just bts), thats the best way to learn imo.  -edit I knew something was wrong when I was in low light (speaking event), not pure darkness but darker than normal and I couldn't bump past 1600 iso without major noise being present (I could tell even on the lcd which is a bad sign), later confirmed in post."
videography,39kyiv,kingatrock,2,Fri Jun 12 19:36:06 2015 UTC,"Nope its the 60D. I have one too and even at ISO 400 indoors it looks ugly.   The GH4 is (suprisingly) actually slightly better when I tried it out in 4K mode. Even shooting in properly lit situations, Canons show some noise. The GH4 doesn't. Check out Dave Dugdales review if you don't beleive me.   In actual low-light, night situations, the GH4 is just as bad if not worse than Canons like everyone below is saying.    I own a Samsung NX1 right now. It's much better in the 100-800 ISO range. It's crystal clean at those ISOs. At 1600 and above, it's only slightly above the 60D. It was $1300 and I bought Rokinon lenses for it.  I'm not advocating my NX1 for you, but these new 4K mirrorless cameras from Sony, Panasonic, and Samsung are much more video-focused than f**king Canons.   If you don't need 4K and want to keep Canon glass, look for a used C100 rather than a 5D. Way better in low-light and video overall. I saw one guy in this thread get one for $1900. Probably more than you want to spend, but completely worth it if low-light is a big deal to you."

In general are there any good subreddits I don't know about?  What cameras are just below a c100?  I've heard a lot of good things about Sony cameras' lowlight performance.

Sorry mate, I can't comment,  but willing to bet you won't get a better deal in Aust since electronics are more expensive in general.   The gh4 and black magic cinema camera are just below the c100.  If you think the 60d is bad, the pocket camera has even worse low light, crop factor, and shit battery life. Dynamic range and color latitude are fantastic though"
videography,39kyiv,Rajminster,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:29:36 2015 UTC,So what's under the c100 that has good low light?
videography,39kyiv,learnaboutfilm,1 point,Sat Jun 13 05:22:32 2015 UTC,Well that's why low light is such a coveted feature.  Not many cameras are truly good at it. Even REDs kinda suck at it.   I would highly recommend getting better lighting gear. Much better long term investment.  The cheaper Sony Alphas are cheap full frames with fantastic low light and dynamic range.

So you're viewing only a small portion of that resolution.   Unless you mean the 8k stream looked worse, still think it's mapped to those 6 faces on the inverse cube.

At the TV station I work at we have a personal camera and a work camera.  My personal camera is a GH4, so I will take stuff that is 4K and scale it down to 720.  My work is a JVC eng style.  We have it shoot 1080 to scale to 720.  It is still HD and looks great.  Something I learned is that you shoot in a bigger resolution than what you will export to.

Having one in the center is alright, but don't fade or cut directly from a subject on the left to one in the center without some b-roll in between.  It'll look less jarring.

videography,39huxk,bboy799,2,Thu Jun 11 20:38:17 2015 UTC,My experience with cheap variable ND filters is that they suck. The amount of light the filter lets through is inconsistent so you end up with some parts of the frame darker than others. Get quality ones and if you can't afford all the different levels stack them and see if you find the image quality acceptable.
videography,39huxk,anon1984,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:55:39 2015 UTC,Can you recommend a specific high quality or even non-cheap variable ND?

Instead of screw-on filters, you might want to consider a $19.99 (on sale) set of Cokin P compatible slide in ND filters with filter holder, lens hood and adapter rings.  Slide in filters are easier to change than screw-ons and are less susceptible to color aberration than variable NDs.  Later, you can get a $54.44 matte box to complement your filters.

videography,39h566,ben3308,2,Thu Jun 11 20:04:04 2015 UTC,"First tip -- ditch the camera and get something with a better sensor. We used to talk in filmmaking forums in 2005 about using 'older' tech like the VX2100 even at the time, but with the litany of HD camcorders, honestly, the VX2100 as an appropriate tool for video is severely dated.  You will be contending with poor resolution and low latitude, which is fine, but there are better (and cheaper) options out there that will yield better results. You're already facing a significant uphill battle, almost needlessly so. Unless you got the camera for under $200, it's not worth it.   Not trying to be an ass, but I've been on the wrong side of the technology changes before, and I wish someone would've cautioned me against it. There's a threshold of outdated/lower technology pieces, and the VX is on the bad side.  Good luck, either way. At the very least you'll be able to get the hang of using it and improve cinematography skills."

If the sound is off, it's ruined. Being out of focus is easier to forgive (or cover with b-roll). I alwas put on only one side of my headphones - so my subject knows I'm listening. Maybe use in-ear headphones in one ear and try using the camera angle to hide this. Make sure to get a camera with flip-screen, so you can flip it out, and peak at it between questions.  The wider the shot, the less likely you are to loose focus. For lights, I just use a Kino-flo or LED-panel, and maybe a hair-light. Use whatever you have available. Look up 3-point lighting. If you don't have any light, try to have the subject sit facing a window - just make sure to check for changing exposure.   Good luck!"
videography,39fgqp,Leoshelby,3,Thu Jun 11 14:23:23 2015 UTC,Suggest having a camera with wifi and an app (Panasonic and Sony have this at least) so you can monitor the video and start and stop.  Run it on a cellphone and keep it in your lap out of view of the camera.

(…)  Our interviewer would have to set up the kit, and they're likely to not be video or audio professionals.   I'd tell your client that if they can't afford a re-shoot then they can't afford not to have someone monitoring.

For someone who has no experience in this field it's just about guaranteed to go wrong at some point.  If your client can't afford a re-shoot, then they NEED to have a professional there doing the setup and monitoring the video and audio. Hell even if they could afford re-shoots they would still need someone monitoring just because a lot can go wrong in an hour-long interview and they would probably have to do it multiple times."

At the end of the day though whoever ends up watching your video, assuming they're not subscribed to this sub isn't going to know whether you shot raw or RAW or rawr or slog or clog or whatever, they're going to judge it based on whether it's watchable or not and whether the story is good or not. The only people I know that shoot and cut raw on a regular basis are doing it for their own benefit - they're not getting paid extra to shoot in an unwieldly format. If you're shooting raw just to shoot it for the sake of it and you have money to throw around then why not but there's no need for it.   Another thing is if you can nail it in camera you won't even feel the need for raw, if projects you've done have suffered because of not having raw it's because whoever is balancing and exposing has fucked up, it's not going to make as much difference as you hope it will, it's going to be better for you to know and work to the limitations of baked in codecs before you move on to something else.

videography,39brfj,jack3d--,2,Thu Jun 11 00:30:44 2015 UTC,A7S stands for Sensitivity. So great low light.  A7R stands for Resolution. So... well massive resolution.   Again at the moment 4K still isnt a standard and no one really is broadcasting it. The argument I would put out there for the A7S over the A7RII would be low light performance. A7S Does fantastic 1080p still

For people complaining about the price consider this: Currently with the A7S (which is much loved for it's full frame low light capabilities), the only way to get 4k output is by purchasing a $2000 external recorder, this has it built in! Not only that but there's 5 axis stabilization built in also!  My only real concern is that how moire and rolling shutter are going to look on the full frame readout of a sensor that large! (since the A7S has problems with it despite only being 12mp). Also there's no cinema 4k, and it's max 30p; I think when we see the GH5 early next year it'll be shooting 60p in cinema 4k (albeit using a similar 2x crop sensor to the GH4).

For the price of a rMBP or even the ASUS, you could make a killer rig over at /r/buildapc or /r/buildmeapc.  I absolutely had to buy a laptop because I travel extensively and I don't have a solid living arrangement right now.  I've had a MBP for a long time but I wasn't married to it. I did a ton of research with HP workstations and Windows laptops. These were the alternative that (1) have a fantastic screen and (2) are powerful enough for editing.   Dell XPS 15 or a Dell Precision M3800 or M4800 (configured with the 4K display) Asus ZenBook UX501JW-DS71T Toshiba Satellite P55T-B5262 (can also be purchased directly through Toshiba) Refurbished HP ZBook 15 with a Dreamcolor display (Dreamcolor = almost 100% sRGB and AdobeRGB coverage)   However, at the end of the day, I picked the rMBP 15"" refresh because it excels in battery life, display quality, build quality, customer support, and size/form factor. I've been editing 4k a7s/shogun footage with ease. I've edited RED Scarlett footage without any issue. Blackmagic 4K DNG is pushing the boundaries of what the laptop is capable of. At that point, you'd need a much more powerful machine.  Are you paying more for the Apple brand? Probably - but I'd rather put out the extra cash for a machine that I'm confident in. Plus, that retina display is freakin' gorgeous.   If I could afford it, I might have gone with a new ZBook.

videography,39cb4b,PriceZombie,2,Thu Jun 11 00:07:35 2015 UTC,"I'm much like you and started with a GH3 and little else.  A lot of what you'll need will depend on the style of filming you're looking to do.  My work is a bit more staged, so I have time to do minor lighting and set up my shots.   Lenses: When I bought the camera, I also purchased Panasonic's 12-35mm F/2.8, which is a fantastic piece of glass, but I find I rarely use it for video.  The motorized focus, limited depth of field as a result of the smaller sensor, and lack up versatility led me away from investing in Panasonic glass. Since I wasn't ready to commit long term to M4/3 and, wanted the ability to repeatably manually adjust focus, and wanted some faster glass, I opted for ""vintage"" 35mm lenses. Full frame glass allows me to use the lenses on other cameras in the future as well.     Choose a brand and stick with it.  There are many options, like old Nikon (Be warned, the focus rings turn the opposite of standard with Nikon, Canon FD, and others, but I went with the very highly regarded Contax/Yashica Zeiss lenses.  There is a speed booster for them which gives me more focal length options and some AMAZINGLY fast glass, which is a big help for the poor low light performance of the GH3.  Additionally there's an eBayer who 3D prints seamless follow focus rings for most of the lenses. Speaking of Follow Focus…  Accessories/Rig: The GH3 has great ergonomics but is still stricken with all of the classic DSLR/Mirrorless problems for video handling.  I first invested in a simple base to allow use of 15mm rails and a follow focus.  One of the less expensive 'generic' ones found on Amazon has honestly bee wonderful for me.  After that, building a heavily customizable shoulder rig became important, so I invested in some longer rails, handles and attachments etc. SmallRig stuff, easily available on Amazon as well, has proven to be very capable and MUCH less expensive than some of the more popular offerings.   I quickly found that pulling focus was difficult on the small screen on the back of the GH3.  It was fine for tripod shots where I could punch in before shooting, but when I was walking about, I needed better reference, so I purchased a 6"" budget monitor and magic arm. Make sure to get something that's at least 720p.    Now that I could keep that nice shallow focus that my fast lenses could provide, I realized that it became difficult to shoot with wide open apertures in brighter lighting and invested in ND Filters.  Many people like Variable ND filters for their smaller size and versatility, but since I have the time to set my shots, and wanted to be open to additional filtration options in the future, I opted for the more precise 100MM filters and a quality matte box.  Just remember, things can get out of hand QUICKLY.  Weigh every potential new purchase against how much it will help you, NOT how much you want it.  You may find a few new lights are more useful than a camera upgrade, or a budget alternative will bring 90% of the benefit at only 20% the price of a popular cinema equivalent."

Yes I think I will start with the ever so popular tiffen variable nd at first but later i will most definitely  move on to proper matte box and nds. What monitor do you have? I will probably get a musthd or wait for bm video assist! Thanks for tip on small rig! Ahhh I can't wait to build up my frankenrig.  Edit: I might pick up an rj speedbooster or mitakon sb. I know they're not the best but reviews have been favorable. At least to start with.

I know it's not on the list but I can't recommend a good wireless mic setup enough.  I'd definitely get a variable ND filter. Get one that fits your biggest lens and get adapters to use it with the smaller lenses. Personally, I'd skip the matte box.  Good choice on the Hondo rig...but seeign as how I'm the one that makes those, I'm probably biased :)"
videography,39cmqr,numberstation5,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:16:25 2015 UTC,Haha just a tad bit bias. I just got the rig in the mail yesterday. It works for bigger shoots and run n' gun. I'm going to test it out this weekend.       I do have a shotgun mic. Its a rode video mic but its serving all my needs. I use my jobs shure wireless set up and I like that one a lot. I need the matte box for the nd filters I want. I'm less than a thousand away from my ideal set up.      Don't want to fan boy to much but great work on the rig!
videography,39cioo,DickLame,2,Wed Jun 10 21:05:53 2015 UTC,"Its hard drive is very slow at 5200RPM, so you'll likely get hitching and stuttering while editing high-bitrate footage unless you use something like a USB3 G-RAID as your media drive.   Don't be fooled by Intel's confusing mobile processor naming - That's a dual core with hyperthreading, not a quad as you may expect. This thing will not be capable of anything better than 1080p.  So it will work, but if you want something better, have a look at 'gaming' laptops. They tend to have higher grade components; and look up processors in machines in your shortlist on ARK to make sure they're actually quad cores.  Also   Natural silver finish   lol wut"
videography,39cioo,smushkan,3,Wed Jun 10 21:13:16 2015 UTC,"While I agree 100% with smushkan's post, as someone who has had experience with using a ""gaming"" notebook for video editing, if at all possible, consider a higher end desktop and a cheap laptop unless mobility is an absolute must. The power per dollar of a desktop graphics card, ram, cpu, etc... is much better for desktops. I thought I would need my Alienware m18x to edit video on the go all the time but it is set up exclusively in my room 95% of the time. Seriously, consider a desktop and a cheap laptop ($350ish) for reviewing footage and edit at home on the desktop.  TL:DR - The laptop you linked isn't going to be great, IF you ABSOLUTELY need to be mobile (editing in coffee shops, airports, etc) consider a gaming laptop, otherwise consider a desktop computer (better performance per dollar in the desktop world)  Best of luck!"
videography,39cioo,Benze2294,2,Wed Jun 10 22:19:25 2015 UTC,"have a look at 'gaming' laptops. They tend to have higher grade components;   erm... no.  The keys to video editing are:   Bandwidth/Throughput - the amount of data the CPU and HD can process at one time, usually measured in giga-tranfers or gigabits.  You achieve high bandwidth by fast HD's either in a RAID or single SSD. You can get an SSD RAID over PCIe which attains the highest bandwidth possible in a single box.  RAM - most you can afford, maxed out is recommended GPU - If your NLE uses CUDA, namely Adobe Premiere, you'll want an nVidia card with at least 192 CUDA cores or more to be able to utilize any of the software's accelerated effects. ALL cards support OpenCL which Premiere also uses for most of it's effects. The GPU DOES NOT have an effect on encoding. Encoding requires A LOT of RAM and A LOT of physical CPU cores. The GPU and throughput affects live timeline editing and effects.    It doesn't matter how many GHz your machine overclocked. It doesn't matter how many frame rates you can run Witcher 3 to be able to edit video. They're two separate animals. To edit 1080HD video or even 4k at 1/4 res or even proxied, a balanced system the 3 things listed above will alleviate any headaches and or head-scratching when editing video with Premiere, FCP or even Avid. As far as any other NLE, like Vegas or WMM, this setup would still benefit those applications. Good Luck!"

videography,398k7n,DanyTheOther,14,Wed Jun 10 01:03:08 2015 UTC,"FYI, I subscribed to this subreddit to read stuff about the topic, and I really know very little about it; I'm not a videographer, thus my opinion represents only that of a commercial watcher ;)  Interesting choice not to use color in a food commercial. It would almost be better if the food was never shown, only the preperatory things such as lighting the flame, because the commercial really succeeds in building a sense of anticipation, and then seeing the food not depart from this made the food look unappetizing. Is this restaurant known for their wines? That part looked sexy as fuck.  I really liked the music and the feel of the commercial and how well they were intertwined. The angles were really cool and there's something to be said for only coloring fire and wine, both pretty interesting topics. It was a really interesting watch for the time it ran.  Overall, I thought it was wayyyy better than commercials I've seen for local restaurants.  edit: and the logo at the end was fucking sick, looks like it could be on a t-shirt or something"
videography,398k7n,keepYourMouthShut,3,Wed Jun 10 02:10:48 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna chime in and agree. It is a great piece of editing for picture and sound. I would color in all or some of the food, the fire in the pan shot at the end, and flash some color(s)/video overlay on the logo, to continue the theme.  Really great piece. The framing and camera moves are sharp, adding to the high energy. My wife hates the song, but I think it's brilliant. It communicates a very specific type of eatery very quickly, and brings up memories and emotions I have associated with ultra-modern restaurant/bars. I'm brainstorming through what I would do as an editor, with what you have so far, which means it's really sparking my imagination, exactly what you want a commercial to do. Fantastic!  Edit: I wanted to mention another thing. I watch a lot of food network, and they are excellent at shooting food: it makes you so hungry you salivate. Your wine shot, and your fire shot did that for me."
videography,398k7n,Yerunkle,4,Wed Jun 10 03:36:42 2015 UTC,"I feel like by making all of the food greyscale and the fire color you're implying that the only way the food stands out is the way it's cooked, not the food itself. Just my opinion though."
videography,398k7n,bottlebowling,2,Wed Jun 10 02:45:21 2015 UTC,"I agree with the rest of the comments, having the food grayscale really subdues the ""flavour"" visually.  The rest of the ad is great, sleek and modern, and I understand the edgy choice to go black and white, but this seems like one of those golden rules that you shouldn't break regardless of theme."
videography,398k7n,cwutididthar,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:24:27 2015 UTC,Agreed. The food should be in color and the final shot should be of the prepared food on the plate. That is the finished product after all. Everything else is awesome!

Also I think when you cut the footage on the two big beats at the start, I think they should have cut to a finished plate of food being presented then mover to to the wrapping of the packet shot. As with the other comments; the food shots should definitely be in colour and the font should be more readable at the end. I like the punchy'ness to the shots though :)"

Food is of course about taste, but colors and textures are equally important ! And unfortunately, we don't see any of that. In the end, your visual choice seems to be like a superficial trick rather than a mean to deliver a message. Good editing job, though."

It seems that with variable aperture lenses, auto aperture gets stuck on and there is no way to disable it. With prime lenses like the 50mm you've described, and telephotos with constant aperture like my Sigma 18-55 1.8 and Tokina 11-16 2.8 the issue is not present.  I do not have this issue with ML on my EOS-M - only the 60D.  Unfortunately I havn't found a way to fix it. I'd recommend trying older versions of ML for the camera to see if that gets around it. I use the camera so infrequently now that I havn't had a chance to roll back myself."

Those are a necessity for organizational purposes  Also, I'm not a big fan of going by minutes for your monthly quota. It's very limiting compared to going by storage space.  Currently, I'm in charge of making a decision on whether to go with Wipster or Frame.io. We have monthly subscriptions to both and will test them out extensively for the next 2-3 months. Whomever adds the most needed features during that time will probably win out.  I really like both services though. You and Frame are replacing Mediasilo which has become a little old in the tooth and much more expensive. Wipster and Frame feel much more modern and is faster and better organized. Once some of those missing features are added you'll leave all the older video review sites in the dust."

It was a great camera in 2009 - but they really should have replaced and discontinued it soon after the FS100 came out.  It would be the equivalent of keeping the GH1 on the market for 6 years without a sensor upgrade.  Not smart.

videography,399rqg,RngMonsterZ,1 point,Wed Jun 10 07:32:39 2015 UTC,"For festivals. Specially in low light, you are going to need that light sensibility. The GH4 and that sigma 18-35 1.8 should be great. But the a7s will certainly be better. I would say go a7s. 4k is not a NECESSITY. Getting the right exposure is. As for lenses if you take the a7s i would suggest a wide angle on a glidecam or so. A 50mm on a FF or 35mm on aps-c for the normal shots. And a long telephoto for portraits. 400mm on the FF and 300mm on the aps-c should be enough. I think that you will be safe running on f5.6 on the a7s. As for the GH4 you would need very fast lenses. I believe you should be fine with the 18-35 1.8, a fast wide angle, a 70-200mm 2.8 + speedbooster. Keep in mind that the gh4 has a m43 sensor,so the crop factor is 2x. Which means a 200mm lens would be 400mm on the gh4 + the speedbooster,you should be @f2.0?. I think both options are ok but the a7s outperforms the gh4 in low light and the gh4 might be a little more expensive if you factor in the lenses."

videography,399rqg,cruzz903,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:03:06 2015 UTC,Yeah. The gh4 probably has better usability and probably a better codec etc. But i think the a7s would still out perform it in low light. So it probably comes down to personal appeal. I personally shoot events. And the low light is certainly a pain in the ass. So i would keep suggesting the a7s over the GH4.

Upgrade to the Shogun later, it's not necessary. You're used to the 5Dmk3 and the GH4 will not perform better than it at night. The Sony will be a huge relief for your use specifically.   If you simply want the best image and exposure for your purpose, A7S. If you want an awesome run and gun cam, the GH4 is slightly better with better battery, lower cost, less rolling shutter, etc.   Also take a look at the Samsung NX1. Costs less than the GH4 and I love mine. I usually advocate for it, but for your purposes a GH4 or A7S would be better suited."

At first glance the Flycam looks like it will be better for a DSLR but I've not used one. Above all, technique is vital of course, I am still practicing hard to improve the look of my footage.

The Glidecam HD's are nicer still, and much easier to adjust.  What lens will you be flying? You want something wide for learning. On a 7D we're talking 10-20mm or so. A wide lens will mask the small sways/wobbles you'll be getting, and its deep DOF will mostly take care of focusing concerns. As you get better with the stabilizer you can move to longer lenses and shallower DOFs."

videography,3977cr,Biffmcgee,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:35:38 2015 UTC,"For the prices I saw on the Proam just get the Glidecam XR. The build will be better and there's actual customer service if you do have issues.  Your kit lens at 18mm is workable for a beginner, but you will most likely still take quite a while to start getting usable footage. If you have the budget I would consider getting something wider, for instance the new Canon 10-18 gets rave reviews and is cheap. It's just not very fast, but you will most likely be stopped down quite a bit for focus reasons anyways."

It bothers me that you're trying to sell the device based on a single promotional video alone made as part of their press release and also attributing the promotional footage by the company who made the device to people in the industry like Andrew claiming that he has one - when he clearly doesn't! Nor has he stated himself that he has one! I don't think selling people on an adapter which we have no idea of how well it performs is in good faith, at all! I'm looking forward to the adapter as well but I think you should be a little more honest with your words considering the lack of info on it atm. Heck, I actually emailed Kipon for a possible review sample over a month ago and didn't even get a response, which gave me some reservations about it.   The only review out thus far is up on here and the authors opinion of the adapter seems to be massively hit or miss as to which lenses and modes it works with, and the only lens that the adapter worked in every single mode with (the 400mm) displayed failed connection messages after a short time of use. So maybe consider linking to this review if you're going to start recommending it so casually."
videography,397cfa,ashyxx,2,Wed Jun 10 14:21:09 2015 UTC,I take your point - I need to buy one before I recommend it as a matter of course (especially to new people).  I will get one in and test it for myself (or at least wait for more reviews) until I recommend it again.  Thanks for the thoughtful feedback.  HCR

It is a beast of a lens, one of the very best m4/3 lens, you won't be disappointed... And it is straight on your budget, you can by another one like the Panasonic 12-35mm which is also excellent."
videography,397cfa,chiquard,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:51:36 2015 UTC,I just watched some shots from it and looks great! But why have both mid range lenses?
videography,397cfa,chiquard,2,Wed Jun 10 19:18:41 2015 UTC,"It was only a suggestion. You can also go for the Panasonic 30-100 f2.8 or, a cheaper alternative the Pana 14-140, which is not the best m4/3, but very useful..."
videography,397cfa,Thermistor1,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:59:05 2015 UTC,"I would recommend both.  I own the Voigtlander 25mm and it is fantastic, compensating for the poor low light performance of the Panasonics.  The issue is that it will be a challenge for things like wide shots in tight spaces.  That's why you need another wide lens.  For performance, I'd recommend this combo as the Voigtlander is beautiful.  For versatility, I would recommend an adapter and a variable lens instead."
videography,397cfa,Doctor_Karma,2,Thu Jun 11 15:34:18 2015 UTC,"Get the Nikon metabones, then get some rokinon nikon cine lenses.

Also if you buy an adapter that has no glass (probably like $20) then you can get 2 focal lengths from 1 nikon lens depending on which adapter you use (the glassless adapter is focal length x2 I believe, metabones shortens the focal length)"

For the occasional time you need the viewfinder, you just have to deal with it.  Don't buy Canon brand batteries.  For $200, you could get EIGHT generic Wasabi brand batteries.  They will be larger than the stock battery too.  You may run into trouble with one or two of them, but that's why you buy more than you need.  When I'm shooting, I always keep the Canon battery in my pocket charged and ready.  It's always the last battery I use.  My logic is should one of the generic batteries fail in the middle of shooting, I've got a genuine battery in my pocket ready to go.  (I've never had one fail.)  On lenses, the 24-105 is a cheap staple that will be on your camera most of the day at any wedding.  Don't buy them new, they are often come bundled on higher-end Cannon kits, so the used market is pretty saturated and prices are low.  The next lens I would get is the 16-35 f/2.8.  It's your all around wide, low light lens.  Wide is always safe, whenever you are in doubt, you can always shoot wide.  Also, I wouldn't mess with putting an Atomos on the C100 for run-and-gun wedding shooting.  There's no good ROI both on equipment and the energy expended in running it."
videography,396sfe,tylerdoubleyou,3,Tue Jun 9 18:29:20 2015 UTC,"This is good advice. Especially the Ninja. Don't get me wrong, I love mine and use it on non-wedding shoots all the time, but for a wedding it's such a pain that I don't bother and no client will be able to tell the difference. Hell, I can only really tell the difference when I'm doing things like greenscreen and rotoscoping.   I differ on the battery situation though. I have the stock battery and the bigger one and I can get through the whole day with the big one most times. In my experience generic batteries get wonky when it comes to things like the time remaining indicator. I would rather have two good big batteries and know  how much time is left than 8 generics. One, for reliability. Two, I try to carry around as little as possible. To each their own though. Just my preference."
videography,396sfe,arthousedirector,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:32:05 2015 UTC,That's what we're thinking.

Nothing beats a solid 24-70, 70-200 and a 11-16 (or was it 16-35?).  We also purchased a ninja blade (higher version of ninja 2) and I wouldn't call it a waste of money but the c100's compression is so good (in comparison to the ninja blade at highest quality) its kind of a moot point. I can still use it for long (4+ hour) recording but other than that the c100 does very well.  I would stick to building out your lenses (or just renting and saving for a while) before a ninja or ronin.  Good luck!  -edit I'd grab another battery (I'm paranoid) and if you're shooting something outdoors or away from power it's easier for my mind to drain 1 battery, send that off to charge (usually takes a few hours) and have 1 active and 1 as a safety in case your live battery fails."
videography,396sfe,104thor,2,Tue Jun 9 18:08:13 2015 UTC,Yeah that's my thought process. Build up the lenses and other equipment and then go for the wish list items such as the ronin or ninja.  I've been told one battery should do most of the day so taking a bit of a risk and only getting the two for now but yeah it's something I'll be adding to quickly. Until then will have a DSLR close to hand.
videography,396sfe,scrmedia,2,Tue Jun 9 18:16:51 2015 UTC,I know from daily experience the c100 fully charged does stay to true to around 4 hours or a little less per battery. When I've shot all day that seems to go by quickly. Just fyi.

videography,395qxl,Hooky14,2,Tue Jun 9 13:22:04 2015 UTC,If you can you are going to want a faster lens. Canon makes a 50mm prime that is awesome for low light event footage. It's pretty cheap and will make a huge difference.   One thing that's tricky with club or event environments is with all the flagging lights you can have not enough light I've second and too much the next. You'll want to play around with your settings the night of to accommodate for the club lights.  This is a really good guide http://www.dandouglas.org/how-to-shoot-nightclub-promo-videos/

Obviously a single on-camera light won't totally help you. But if you're shooting individuals you should be all good. Open up your aperture as wide as it'll go and use as little light as possible so that the background can be present in the shot.  If your subject is little too brightly and you have to stop down your iris to expose them properly, the dark background will become pitch black and everyone will look like they're floating in space."
videography,395qxl,liado,2,Wed Jun 10 13:46:38 2015 UTC,You need to shoot with faster glass.   I do a lot of low light and never shoot above 2.8 when it's that dark.   You can get a nifty fifty (1.8) for $150 or a 24mm 2.8 for $170   If you can afford it get the 1.4 50mm for $450 its much better.
videography,395qxl,brazilliandanny,2,Tue Jun 9 14:42:37 2015 UTC,"If you're filming any sort of crowd or stage environment, a light is gonna be incredibly distracting for anybody actually attending the event.  You can boost your ISO, but only to an extent on the 70d. (a friend shot this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iYu8KQaJIc with a t4i, which has much worse ISO capabilities) However, if the event is paying well enough, rent an a7s with a metabones adapter. You can shoot at f4 and the iso can seriously get cranked without any bad noise. You won't have to worry about a light at all. Video comes out beautifully, and it's incredibly easier to retain the club-like feel with available lighting.  If you rent from lensrentals.com, you can get the whole package for around $150+shipping."

In Canada we're widely regarded as having the worst service for a 1'st world country. Not only are the speeds inadequate for the cost, but our caps make it that if we consistently viewed things in 4k, 6k, etc we'd be dropping 300+/month on overage charges alone.   In terms of consumer technology, it'll be a while before we're caught up to 8k with resolution. Broadcasting is just for the most part, finishing making the switch over to 1080. When I started working in news we just made the switch to HD from SD and that was just a few years ago.   Will it improve, sure.

My editing rig utilizes 2.5k effective, I edit a mix of RED and BMCC footage on it, but I've yet to deliver anything in 2.5k or 4k, let alone 8k to a client. It's unnecessary, especially for videography.  What shooting in the various K's is good for is downscaling for better quality in the 1080 finished product. Most consumers are just hitting true 1080 now, a lot of networks and stations are just playing catch-up...HD happened really quickly in the communications world, and people are just seeing the transition now. The average consumer is only starting to understand 4k.   Edit:  One more thing to add, it is nice to see early adopters like YouTube doing 4/6/8k. It allows companies to strive to compete for the consumer market now that it's available to the public. If more content utilized 4k currently (Netflix, iTunes video store, etc.) I am sure we could see a major rush from manufacturers to develop inexpensive 4K HD monitors and hardware specifically designed for 4K that is consumer grade. Raising the bar is good for everyone, it allows people to start developing technology for it instead of relying on a natural evolution."

videography,3939u4,BlueVerse,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:16:14 2015 UTC,"I have a theory if someone can confirm or reject:  compression gets efficient for higher pixel density.  meaning, compressing a raw 8K footage 1000 times would take less than 4x space of compressing a 4k footage 1000 times (even though 8K has 4x more pixels).  Because for higher resolutions, most of the scene has not much detail, also because of depth-of-field, most of the view has been pretty well captured by lower resolutions so additional pixels don't do much.  This of course assumes properly engineered compression algorithms, which is an amazing feat and not something that can be called 'easier', but I'm not talking about that (I'm assuming the algorithm for a given resolution is top-notch).  actually i have an even crazier theory. Beyond some threshold, like 16k or 32k, the information content of a scene flattens out, unless some telescopic camera is used. Meaning going from 32k to 64k would add practically zero bytes to the compressed video size (with top-notch algorithms of course)."

You're going to need a massive screen to be able to tell the difference between 4K and 8K, and I'm not sure most viewers are going to care enough in order to bother with the larger file sizes. There also has to be a point where you stop getting a benefit when downscaling to HD and 4K. Even then, it's going to be ages before people even adopt 4K. Heck, 90% of what I watch is still in SD or less (although, granted, it is mostly downscaled from HD masters)."

It's not as good a video camera as the amazing 2.064,99€ A7s (more moire, less sensitive in low light, no 4K output), but shooters are nonetheless doing good work with it, as seen here:   Travelogue - New Zealand Sony A7 - First Look AMBER SOLEIL - Fashion Film   It's an excellent 24.3MP full frame camera too: https://www.flickr.com/groups/sony-a7/pool/  Hope this is helpful and good luck!"

I wasn't a fan of the lighting, but I personally prefer soft shadows, although the spec highlights on your food and utensils benefit from the bare bulbs.  I turned off the music, maybe I just wasn't in the mood for it or something.  I found the music to really overpower the video content.

videography,395nl2,BakedChloe,2,Tue Jun 9 12:52:43 2015 UTC,"I'm looking for a camera that's mainly video focused, but still confident enough with stills.   If your interest is primarily in video, I recommend you return the Nikon and get the £679 Panasonic G7.  The D5100 lacks both basic and advanced video features, such as:   Focus peaking for razor sharp manual focus The ability to change aperture in Live View (video) mode a built in intervalometer for time lapse a usable viewfinder when you switch to Live View compatibility with silent, video optimized lenses (here and here are a couple of examples of the problem with the D5100 and noisy Nikon autofocus motors) 1080/50fps for smooth HD slow motion (the D5100 is limited to 30 frames per second) 3840x2160p Ultra High Definition resolution (the D5100 is limited to 1920x1080p) compatibility with affordable power zoom lenses (Panasonic has a couple of smooth, affordable  power zooms)   The Panasonic G7 has internal Ultra High Definition ""4K"" recording (4 times the resolution of Nikon cameras in this price range), 1080/50p HD recording for in-camera slow motion, an electronic viewfinder you can actually use for shooting video outdoors in bright sunlight (when a DSLR's LCD is likely to be washed out), focus peaking , a built-in intervalometer for time lapses and compatibility with affordable Panasonic power zoom lenses.  Here are a couple of early examples of what it can do (please watch at 2160p and your monitor's highest resolution):   LUMIX DMC-G7 Sample Video in 4K by Colin Witherill Panasonic Lumix G7 / G70 Launch - 4K - 4KPhoto Modes (shot in photo/video mode - each frame is an 8MP still photo)   To be fair, Nikons in this price range are better still cameras - but Panasonic G and GH cameras are a much better all-around choice for both video and stills.  I still have my old Nikon D50, but when I started shooting large sensor video, I switched to Panasonic GH cameras.  I have all four of them, as pictured here.    In my experience, Panasonics are the best value-for-money video/still hybrid cameras you can buy.  Hope this is helpful and good luck with your decision!"

It can sometimes be a game of guessing. Some Directors have their own preferences and want to see it emulated. It's hard to sometimes step into that persons shoes, especially if it's not something you do on a daily basis.   Repeat, repeat, repeat. Repetition and working with that Director is the only way to get to the point where you'll be seamless with that persons vision. Hopefully the interview didn't damage the relationship in that sense, and hopefully they feel you've learned and will pay more attention now! Better luck next time!"

videography,391elo,imaworkaholic,4,Mon Jun 8 15:27:58 2015 UTC,"On the focal ranges of lenses, the lower you go, the wider the shot.  If I wanted only one lens for the G6, it would probably be the Panasonic 12-35mm f2.8.  It goes from sort of wide to moderate zoom which is a decent mid range of focal lengths.  Plus the 2.8 aperture is decent in low light, and it has image stabilization.  I suggest a mono-pod for instances where you don't have much set up time and need to be mobile.  It's cheap and fairly simple.  Grainyness happens when your camera is not getting enough light.  The four factors that you have control of that can help this are:   Aperture on the lens. F-stop.  The lower the f-stop you have it set at, the wider the aperture is open and the more light comes through, brightening the picture.  When you see a lens listed with an F and a number, that is the max aperture.  You can also close the aperture to let less light in.  In dark situations, make sure you are at the widest (lowest) setting. This also has the effect of increasing the amount of background blur in the picture which some find pleasing (also less stuff is in focus so watch out). ISO - how much the camera is working to boost the exposure.  The G6 isn't great in low light.  I think if you have to boost this over 800, you'll be getting grain.  Try not to shoot with auto exposure on. Shutter speed.  This is how long for every frame of video that the camera absorbs light.  Longer lets more light in, so it is brighter.  Standard shutter speed is usually 1/50 of a second.  You can slow it down to around 1/25 in extreme situations, but you'll see some motion blur.  This is more ok for interviews and things where you're not panning the camera around or filming fast action. lighting in the environment.  If you're shooting interviews, get some lighting gear!  At least get one of those camera mounted LEDs.  Choose better spaces with better natural lighting."
videography,391elo,averynicehat,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:04:10 2015 UTC,"All great advice.  Just to tack on, the wider the shot, the easier it is to ""stabilize"" or I should say, the motion is less noticeable. Many early vids (more coverage, news style) like to zoom in because they are hesitant to walk the camera closer to their subject.  The higher you go in focal length, the more noticeable movement is.  If you are fighting a lot with shaky footage, your cheapest, best trick is to widen out and get closer. While it may not be your most aesthetically pleasing shot, it is something important for beginners to learn.  /u/averynicehat has a great recommendation for that 12-35mm lens."

I'll sort of detail the more complex ones...alot of them are just scaling up sitting there and could be done with basic keyframes..  ""Innovation that ensures"" - text is 3D and motion tracked to the footage so it mirrors the footage. Probably not keyframed manually.  ""All The Children"" - the boy in front is rotoscoped out so the text can sit behind him.   ""A Day When"" - this looks like it's a combo of motion tracking and rotoscoping but I'm gonna guess they just masked the text and threw on a couple of keyframes and tracked it to the footage.   ""All Communities"" - rotoscoped the guys legs out and tracked the text to the footage.   ""Devices"" - this has some motion tracking AND the ""ken burns"" effect where they will cut out a still and put it into a 3D space so the image sort of moves with a bit of a 3D effect... just google ""Ken Burns"" effect....

Panasonic G and GH cameras, for example, have a better downscaling algorithm. Here are a couple of side-by-sides between the Canon 60D and a moire-resistant Panasonic GH camera:   60D vs GH2 Moire Test Canon 60D vs Panasonic GH2 evil moiré test   Newer Canon cameras are not much better.  Here is a side-by-side between the Canon 60D and 70D:   Canon 70D and 60D moire comparison   Instead of a Nikon or Canon DSLR, you might want to seriously consider the new $797.99 (with 14-42mm kit lens and free Audio Technica AT8024 microphone) Ultra High Definition Panasonic G7.  The Panasonic G7 has internal Ultra High Definition ""4K"" recording (4 times the resolution of Sony, Nikon and Canon cameras in this price range), 1080/60p HD recording for in-camera slow motion, an electronic viewfinder you can actually use for shooting video outdoors in bright sunlight (when a DSLR's LCD is likely to be washed out) and compatibility with affordable Panasonic power zoom lenses.

After I sold my Canon T2i (550D), I switched to Panasonic GH cameras.  I have all four of them, as pictured here.

As a filmer who also does a fair amount of photography (and I film skating too), the Panasonic is making much bigger strides in the video world than Canon these days. Consider that G7 package because it may not seem like a big deal but audio is a big consideration! You can watch 480p video with good audio no problem, but shit audio and 4K will make interviews intolerable.  If you're filming skateboarding, get a fisheye. The best option is a Rokinon 8mm fisheye for Canon/Nikon and then a Canon/Nikon(respectively) to micro 4/3 focal reducer. Or if you don't want to adapt, the Rokinon 7.5mm fisheye is also a good option, just not as good. If you don't need 4K, the Panasonic G6 and that fisheye are way below your budget so you can get things like handles, lights, mics, etc.  Good luck and have fun!"

videography,38z7uz,hotdog-water,2,Mon Jun 8 02:15:18 2015 UTC,Have you tried filming anything with focus tracking on the G6? If it's anything like my GH4 it's REALLY bad and I wouldn't dream of using any kind of autofocus in video; it loses track waaay too easily! It wouldn't be exactly hard to shoot with a manual lens while keeping everything in focus; just stop the aperture right down to something like f5.6+ i.e. so everything is in focus and you don't have a shallow depth of field going on and set the lens to infinity focus. Most likely how this video was shot anyways. Good luck!

videography,38z7uz,aldolega,2,Mon Jun 8 04:38:35 2015 UTC,"You don't need autofocus with a fisheye, the depth of field is huge. The manybrand (Rokinon/Samyang/etc) 7.5mm is just as sharp and wide as the Panasonic, and its also on sale for $199 right now.  Your other option, if you want something super wide for video, is an 8mm APS-C manybrand in the mount of your choice (most go for Canon EF or Nikon), and a matching focal reducer/speedbooster. This will give you an extremely wide FOV, a good bit wider than the native 7.5 or 8mm lenses."

videography,38yury,Dreamscape18,4,Mon Jun 8 00:24:56 2015 UTC,"NO! If you like color correcting footage, don't buy a Canon/Nikon DSLR. You will have no latitude. You can add mild grades, but even that brings up noise in the image.   Judging by your interest in the D600 you want a sub $1000-1500 camera. I would highly, highly suggest a Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera,Panasonic GH4 or Samsung NX1.   The BPCC records in RAW and ProRes. The latitude will be spectacular. Battery life and low light are horrible though.   Both the NX1 and GH4 still record h264/h265, but the bitrate is much higher and it seems the cameras just compress video better than a Canon/Nikon DSLR. The latitude on my NX1's footage far outpaces my Canon 60D's.   I personally went with a Samsung NX1, but the GH4 is amazing too. Choose any of them over your Nikon for latitude in color color correction. (For my NX1, I have to convert from h265 to ProRes, which is better for grading and editing anyway)  Your soon-to-be Sony A7s in Slog2 mode will have latitude close to that of the BPCC, but not quite. Significantly better than H264 though. The A7s records to XAVC internally or use a Atomos Shogun for 4K ProRes."

For youtube color grading seems unnecessary unless you're doing it for fun. You can always play with the picture profiles the D600 has until you get close to a look you like.  FWIW I also have a D600 and while it's not the best it can get some decent quality footage. Whatever you do never use it in crop mode!
videography,38yj5e,RJKfilms,3,Sun Jun 7 22:50:59 2015 UTC,Yes. Panasonic mirrorless cameras are more aimed towards video but have smaller sensors so if you don't do a lot of low light you'd probably be better off

videography,38uthp,thebobsta,3,Sun Jun 7 02:16:37 2015 UTC,"It all sorta depends on what you are doing. I have built a number of computers but my most recent one was for me and my editing needs. I would definitely prioritize a good quad core processor such as a 4690k or 4790k. If you can leg it, go up to the x99 chipset and get hex cores for some extra power.   After that, prioritize ram amount. You should be getting at least 16gb of ram for the editing apps but I might say you should go for 32gb if you want extreme longevity on this pc. Again, completely up to you.   Ram speeds are somewhat important but in all honesty, you won't see massive differences in editing. I mean, faster ram might render out a few seconds faster, but as ram is clocked higher, latency or timings go up as well, sometimes negating any and all performance boosts.   A solid GPU is a good choice for an editing computer. Depends on what apps you use though. I run a 980 in my comp and premiere seems to use it and it runs flawlessly. Again, based on your budget, you could look at a good gpu but you shouldn't put all your cash money in there.   Beyond that, a nice efficient power supply is a good choice, as well as a silent and functional case. Don't skimp on a case. You'll regret it. A fractal r5 is a perfect case for an editing pc cause it has good airflow and it's very quick.   If you plan on overclocking your CPU, make sure you get a good motherboard and a nice cooler as previously mentioned.   Last by not least, storage. Make sure to get an SSD or two if you can afford it. I have a 250gb for my os and apps, and then another 250gb for project work. Having all of my working projects on fast accessible media is awesome. And then ""archive"" it to an hdd when done. Let me know if you need further guidance.   Edit: totally missed the 1000 bucks budget. Would definitely say a 4690k with a solid mobo, 16gb of ram, an ssd and maybe a GTX 960/970 is possible in that budget."

videography,38tawh,redonculous,3,Sat Jun 6 17:07:50 2015 UTC,"Huh.  You have a LOT of options.  Easiest that comes to mind is this.  You'll need a camera with a clean output, and a capture card or shuttle that will let you plug that into your laptop/tower as a source.  Blackmagic a fairly inexpensive device for that for one example.  https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/intensity    Don't forget sound, depending on if you're coming off a board, recorder, or direct from a mic you have to get it into the encoding device as well.    You'll also need to install Flash Media Live Encoder (FMLE) or Wirecast.  Get a youtube channel in good standing and enable live streaming here - https://www.youtube.com/my_live_events  When you go in to setup the event they'll actually have stream config  packages you can download and import into FMLE.  Can make it really easy.  The only tricky part will be selecting your inputs when you setup your encoding software for the first time.  There are a ton of other streaming services online and a million other ways you could do this.  I mean, when you say live screens, what feeds those?  Can you do a DA to split HDMI out to them all?  Are they able to grab feeds from the web?  Etc."

videography,38tawh,edinc90,2,Sat Jun 6 19:39:22 2015 UTC,"If it's simply a matter of taking a stationary camera's feed and putting it on all the screens in a venue, a big SDI or HDMI DA would work. Do all the screens have a central ""hub"" that they're connected to (usually called a router?) If so, that's pretty simple. Just get your camera to output the proper format for the screens (or scale it,) send it to the router/hub, and you're done.  If the camera is mobile, that gets into wireless video, which is expensive and reliable, or cheap and unreliable.  Let us know more about what you want to do."
videography,38tawh,edinc90,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:32:55 2015 UTC,Awesome. Yes the screens are advertising screens so they are fed by a router.   Mobile camera would be great.

Can I output from a 5D MKII to a wireless transmitter in to a computer/board that could convert the hdmi stream to the appropriate codec/bitrate etc for the advertising screens?  Thanks for your help.
videography,38tawh,philldaagony,2,Sat Jun 6 19:06:49 2015 UTC,"I would look at the Teradek Bolt Pro 300/600/2000. It takes HDMI in, and has a 300/600/2000ft range. The output is either HDMI or HD-SDI.  You need to speak with the venue about what format their screens need for input. They are likely fed by CAT6 with a converter on each if it's a newer venue, or by VGA/5-wire or Component if it's older. The router will likely only take in a specific frame rate/resolution, so you'll need to convert your signal appropriately. Kramer and Extron make great scalers, and the Bolt outputs HD-SDI and HDMI if either of those are an option. Blackmagic makes HD-SDI to analog converters."

The slow-mo tells me that they're shooting at a high frame-rate and slowing it down in post. Likely 60fps and delivering 30.  The depth of field is actually fairly deep, so they either shot this stopped down from your standard WFO that all the DSLR kids love these days, or it's not a DSLR at all, and is a smaller-sensor camera (remember the 3 things that affect DoF: frame size, focal length, f stop.)  I would say, that with your DSLR I would NOT use the 50 prime. I'd use your 18-55. Get a steadicam and an operator who knows how to use it. The increased DoF will also make focussing on the movement easier. Just keep your subject inside the DoF and you'll be fine (look at a DoF table.)"

I took a cheap shot at the stereotype that DSLR shooters always shoot wide open, thus creating razor-thin depth of field that causes most subjects to be out of focus or move in and out of the focal plane since they don't have a real 1st AC to pull focus because they have no discipline and they think that because they have 6400 ISO they can shoot with absolutely no lights wide open and that makes it look cinematic.

videography,38rb5w,ashyxx,3,Sat Jun 6 16:10:05 2015 UTC,"In theory you could - these guys are pretty good at these types of videos though; they have a lot of steadycam/gimbal experience! Which do take some time to setup and learn - You'll find that shots take time to plan because you need to make sure you're hitting focus. They probably have used a wide prime and the Wifi functionality of the GH4 to make focusing easier (touch to focus). Also, if you shoot in a higher frame rate it helps smooth out the footage even more hence the slo mo ...plus it looks really cool. Good planning is like 90% of the work in these shots though! If you are specifically talking about wanting to go and film a con in the same style if I'm being brutally honest (as someone who goes to lots of anime cons) I would try and avoid filming something in this style; Sneaky Zebra started the trend a few years back and this kind of stuff is being done to death now; it's getting kind of boring and I would think about other ways one could engage with the con goers! For example there's one person (not myself) who does spin cam videos which I thought was a pretty neat idea, sure the footage isn't technically the best but the truth is that these kind of things don't really need to be; they're about engaging with the audience/guests and letting them be at the forefront of it all. Same with any event videography really, weddings included. Good luck!"

I've tried out the 24-105 and I felt I could use JUST a pinch more. It's just that in all the wedding videos I've seen, the really wide shots are my favorite ones. Also the 2.8 on the wide lens can come handy, as the 4.0 probably won't cut it during nighttime (I have the 50mm, but it doesn't have IS).  That's the line of reasoning I ended up with.

It's not a good photo lens (in my opinion) but works great for video. That's inexpensive enough to buy instead of rent. It has a great look when wide open, also. Plenty crisp and clean.   I really believe width-wise, the 24-105 is plenty wide, but you may have issues with only going to f4, unless the wedding is outside and there's lots of light indoors.  No normal person will be able to tell the difference between a useable shot from the 16-35 and the 24mm setting on the 24-105. You won't want to go wider than 19-20mm anyway, and the difference between 24 and 20mm is not much, especially if you work to minimize the difference via shot selection and composition."

Photoshop and Lightroom are fantastic when it comes to compensating for vignetting automatically. I don't have CC open in front of me, so I can't check for any other fixes in the effects panel right now. The fastest way I can think of that will do a pretty good job is a feathered inversed oval curves/levels adjustment in Premiere CC, which is not that complicated though it can add up after a while. It's definitely worth acknowleding!"

If you use APS-C lenses and you shoot in HD, you'll likely have some vignetting with some lenses. The field of view with the XL is only about 10% wider than the standard Speed Booster."

I had high hopes for the DVX-200, but Panasonic decided to give us a 1990s camcorder instead of an entry level interchangeable lens Super 35 cinema camera to compete with $4-$10K entry level cameras from Canon, Sony, Blackmagic, AJA and even JVC.  Instead of buying a Speed Booster to turn my GH4 into a pseudo Super 35 camera, I think I'll save up a little money and buy a real Super 35 camera."
videography,38nr6s,Chuckms,2,Fri Jun 5 13:42:45 2015 UTC,"The speed booster has the benefit of increased brightness over native s35 cameras, so that's one reason to use a GH4+booster over true s35.   Also, why is it important to you that Panasonic make a s35 camera when there are already so many options for s35 cameras like the ones you mentioned? There are half a dozen companies competing in that format, Panasonic should keep doing what they do best with m4/3."
videography,38nr6s,ashyxx,2,Fri Jun 5 14:21:48 2015 UTC,"The speed booster does offer ""increased brightness"", but the FS7 and C series offer significantly better high ISO performance which negates the idea of using a GH4+speedbooster over any other 35 super sensor... that said, we haven't seen the low light performance of the URSA mini. Most people prefer the look or at least the flexibility of having a larger sensor plus with good high iso you have more control over aperture in case you're not in the mood for bokehliciousness. The s35 market may be saturated, but it isn't saturated with competitively priced options that have the resolution and high frame rates of the GH4... if I were greedy I'd actually be more interested in asking for full frame with a crop sensor option like the a7s. Bigger sensors make a lot of sense for a lot of people, just look at RED releasing a vistavision option too."

Personally I don't even think the frame rates of the GH4 are very impressive, it can still only do 24fps @ 4k.  The FS700 is about as inexpensive as high frame rates on a large sensor are going to come for at least a few more years. That's $5k for 60fps 4k raw, 240fps @ 1080, and 480fps @ 720.

After seeing the level of detail out of the most basic codecs from the GH4 and A7S (plain avchd), I don't ever consider shooting video with the 60D anymore. With Canon's line skipping method, the image usually comes out more like 720p. As far as I know, Canon hasn't really improved it much in the 70D. The GH4 is about the same in low light compared to the 60D, and probably worse overall than the 70D, though it has what I believe is more pleasing grain.

videography,38poyq,The601,3,Sat Jun 6 02:35:44 2015 UTC,"For me, I like it more.   The 4K is clearly sharper regardless of what GH4 fanboys say. The NX1 does full 6.5K sensor readout and downsamples. The level of detail is spectacular.  The slow-mo is much better, high bitrate, 120fps in 1080p, sound, and autofocus Better in low-light- much better in the 100-800 range. 800 and up, they both are shockingly close. But I mostly shoot 100-800 anyway. Higher bitrate relatively- 80mbits h265 on NX1 is about equal to 160 mbs h264. GH4 is only 100mbs h264 Much shallower depth of field. Less crop factor.  I hate the menu system of the GH4. This is more subjective. The NX1 shows Samsung's mastery of UI. The swivel screen on the GH4 is very useful though. People have complained about GH4's colors, whereas the NX1 has more accurate colors and very vibrant looking at that.  AF is much faster on the NX1 Can charge camera while shooting using USB battery or adapter to wall   Downsides   small lens selection Samsung makes good lenses, but very small and weird selection. The 45mm f/1.8 is the one I use and it's fantastic and cheap.  No accessory support- it's a hipster camera, so nothing like metabones speedboosters or custom rigs no swivel screen less battery life than GH4 (HOWEVER, the it can plug into a outlet and keep shooting) h265 is a bit of a hassle to transcode everytime"
videography,38poyq,Rajminster,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:29:34 2015 UTC,"Haven't used the NX1, but it definitely has a higher rated sensor in most aspects: http://www.dxomark.com/Cameras/Compare/Side-by-side/Samsung-NX1-versus-Panasonic-Lumix-DMC-GH4___976_943  Definitely better in low light, a bit more dynamic range, etc. I felt that the micro 4/3 system had a much more mature and established lens lineup than the Samsung system.

videography,38oo3y,spruitm,2,Fri Jun 5 23:39:13 2015 UTC,"If you're going to be using two cameras, you'll need some way to switch them. If you want to do a webstream, you'll need a computer, fast internet connection, and a capture device.  Telestream WireCast will let you stream and switch from a computer interface. You'll need as many capture inputs as you have cameras. For a two camera setup, you could get two single-channel capture devices (like the Blackmagic DeckLink Mini Recorder, or Intensity) or one two-channel device (like the Blackmagic DeckLink Duo.)  WireCast can also record, but you will need a separate, large, fast hard drive for that. I would recommend a purpose-built computer to run WireCast on, a consumer laptop won't do it.  In terms of cameras, I would recommend a camera with SDI outputs, since HDMI probably won't go as far as you need it to. HDMI is usually good for 1080i transmission of less than 50 feet. SDI is spec'd for 328 ft (100 m.) It's also a more robust cable and connector. At the very least, a couple HDMI to HD-SDI converters would work.  If this is to be a permanent installation, I would look into mounting your cameras in the venue. From how you're describing the setup, you would not have operators for the cameras. You will, however, need someone to run the switcher and start/stop the webstream and record.  I'm a video engineer and have worked a lot with mobile systems and webstream solutions.

I had some FD glass from my dads old kit and decided to see if I could use an adapter and try it. It did not go well. Here's the layout:  GH4 -> Metabones EF Speedbooster -> Fotodiox Pro Lens mount EF to FD -> Canon FD 50mm 1.4  I figured this wouldn't work because of the gap left by the second adapter and the extra glass elements in between. I was right. I had to try though. The results were strange. Ultimately, the focus was really ""off"". By that, I mean the focus was really soft and almost dreamy. Could have its uses I suppose. Secondly, the bokeh was really strange. It was more like a blurry double vision. Not the normal out of focus bokeh you'd be used to. It's really ugly. There are some instances where this did work. It's possible it could be used in a bind, but I would recommend against this type of setup. I will not be using it.  I can try and post some results if I get some time this weekend.

I've seen blind generic budgets sink a bunch of young companies who, when asked for a general budget for general videos, coughed up a number. What is then asked for tends to be way beyond the scope of what the budget will allow, yet the client holds the production company to their numbers. The production company, not wanting to lose the client, loses their profit margin and often goes into debt to make the client happy so they get more work.  They do get more work... with the same high expectations and low budgets. (Sometimes they don't get more work: one company I worked for did one project for which they were sorely under budgeted and went out of business immediately following the end of the project.)  If you are going to bid on a generic project, spec it out: say, three interviews and a half day of B-roll for a full day of shooting, three days of editing, title cards and an end card, plus library music. Price it all out, mark it up at least 20% for your cut, add 10% for contingencies and there's your number. (If your buddy needs a cut then add that ON TOP of the budget. Do not cut your profit margin, otherwise why are you in business?)  Unless you can spec out some generic shoot scenarios and know you can deliver those for a specific budget and still make money, refuse to budget anything until you know exactly what is expected. And even then, take away their concept, script it, board it, and budget it based on what you need to do the job.  The only way you can cover yourself for the inevitable overages when they want to add to the project, or their people don't show up when scheduled and you have to come back, is to lay it all out in writing and say, ""This is what you're paying for. If the schedule changes or you add things then the price will go up."" Be upbeat and positive about it, though. Don't be ""negative."" ""I'd love to do this for you! It's not in the original budget but I'll crunch some numbers and let you know what it'll cost to put this in. I'm so excited!""  It sometimes helps to couch it in a passive voice. Instead of ""I have to charge you more money,"" say ""That's great. The budget has now changed. I'll let you know how much shortly."" Or, ""I'm happy to do that for you! I'll let you know how that changes the budget."" You didn't change the budget, it just changed on its own based on what they need. It's a subtle way of keeping you from being the bad guy.  Just tossing out numbers based on ""What will it cost to just do a video thing?"" will bury you every time.  EDIT: Look up ""AICP Budgeting Template"" on Google. It's overkill for what you need but it still helps to lay all the costs out and see what the total is."

videography,38k5h2,ArtAdamsDP,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:28:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that way you know exactly how much everything will cost and you'll know whether you can accommodate the client when they want to add something (and they always do) with or without charging more money.  Also, you set the precedent that there's no package price. The jobs cost what they'll cost. The advantage there is that you don't charge them more for simple jobs, so you can sell it that way. Each job is custom, and is a more efficient use of their money.  Good luck! :)"
videography,38k5h2,CinePhileNC,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:01:24 2015 UTC,"Awesome advice man.  I had a former business partner that basically sunk us because he would do exactly the opposite of what you said.  He was too afraid to scare the client with a big number, even though it was a fair and researched number. So happy to be out of that relationship!"
videography,38k5h2,ArtAdamsDP,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:11:07 2015 UTC,"Yup, that happens too. And companies that are honest will lose bids to companies that wing numbers and underbid... but they won't lose a lot of business because that company won't be around long.  I remember working for one company that did this consistently. How they stayed in business was beyond me. Finally they bit off more than they could chew: they signed a contract to do three weekly web shows for 50 weeks, and they underbid it. Three months in one of the partners told me, ""We have too much to do, we're spending too much money on these productions, and we need to get more work in to keep us afloat because these shows are financially killing us!"" They had to hire more people and invest in more resources than their spitball number allowed.  They got through the year but the company disbanded immediately after. The partners were stressed, overworked and all wanted to go different directions.  The lesson they didn't learn is that if you're insecure about your work, and you underbid constantly, you'll put yourself out of business. If you're worth the money then present yourself that way and do work that reflects that. There are always clients who can't tell the difference and will go with someone cheaper because they don't care that much about how it all looks, so go after the clients that know the difference and will pay fairly for it.  I know of several director/producer teams where the director will work on the creative with the client and then hand it off to the producer, who will do three different budgets for three different levels of production. They hand in the most expensive one, and then if the client balks they produce the next one and say, ""Well, here's what we can do if you drop this, this and this."" They don't get paid for this, but it usually gets them the job--and when they do it, they make money.  It's worth it occasionally to take on a project at cost or for a lower margin just to show what you can do, but it must be made clear that this is a one time deal. It also helps if it's something you haven't done before, because you can then add it to your reel to get more work.  A branding consultant once told me, ""If you think of yourself less as a passionate artist and more as a small business, you'll do a lot better. You'll still get to do what you want to do, but you'll also make money at it... which means you get to keep doing it. If something doesn't make sense to you as a money-making business, you shouldn't be doing it."""
videography,38k5h2,People_of_Reddit,2,Fri Jun 5 20:57:03 2015 UTC,"The old rule of thumb used to be $1000 per produced minute. I even have clients who reference that and think projects should be quoted accordingly. That is absolutely not the case anymore. Depending on the project, you could easily spend $1000 in equipment rentals for a :30 second ad. I would come up with a fixed price for your time to shoot and edit and then let him know that depending on the project, the total cost will vary. You have to account for your time. As a creative/producer who doesn't sell a physical product, that's all you have."

Do not give a firm number on what a 15 or 30 sec ad will cost.  He may be your friend but this is business.  When I first started out the agency I did most of my work for wanted me to create a package price.  There are way too many variables for that.  A TV station will often have a package price ($x for 30 sec spot etc) but they can write off the overtime from the ad revenue they get from the client. Also get a lawyer before you sign a contract.  You'll want to ask yourself if you you want to keep the rights to the footage and files and they just get the completed spot, or if they get everything (hint: project files should never be theirs unless they pay mega bucks).  If they ask why no package prices just ask them how much does a house cost, or bring it back to advertising and ask how much a media buy is... The answer is it depends."

If you had a sound guy you'd have the NTG2 on a boom pole and right up to the subject, not on camera.  Otherwise, I'd just trust the auto white balance unless the lighting is really funky. But definitely i'd take manual control of the aperture and focus (and ISO). Video AF on DSLRs always looks terrible to me."

On the next batch of videos we do I plan to manually set up the camera, because I really need to start doing that.  Pretty sure I can convince him to at least use a shotgun mic on a boom.

Also the money we have came from selling our old equipment that was in our closet that we forgot about. We spent half of it on new editing computers, and the other half is going towards cameras. Trust me, they love what we produce so much, that they feel we are fine with what we have. We as a staff know we can do much better with better equipment, but they think we are fine as is, since we have been getting by on post production talent alone in most cases.

I very nearly bought the Benro, but then I saw this CheesyCam video and it convinced me the Sirui would be worth a little more money.  I put the Benro S6 head on it.    FYI, the head and monopod both fit into the bag that comes with the Sirui, but only just!  While I have never seen or used the Benro, I do believe I made the right decision.  The Sirui is very nice, and very stable.  I do prefer snap locks over twist locks, but that's the Sirui's only shortcoming, in my opinion."

I currently have a twist lock carbon fiber monopod and I'm thinking about swapping it for a regular snap lock one because I have to use a lot of force to get it to tighten enough so the camera doesn't drop, it's really annoying."
videography,38j6pd,IronTek,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:06:09 2015 UTC,"They seem fine.  They don't require a lot of force at all, I would say.  Though one annoying thing is that the twist lock to lock/unlock the panning up top lock/unlock in the same direction as the legs, so if you try to tighten the monopod and your hand is in the very natural location of the pan lock, it'll unlock it! I think it would have been better to make those go in opposite directions.  I would have preferred snap locks, but these aren't bad."
videography,38j6pd,ashyxx,4,Fri Jun 5 20:30:48 2015 UTC,"A note about the Benro, there is an updated version (model number A48FDS4 or A48FDS6) with a MUCH better foot over the model you mentioned that has slightly longer legs and also incorporates a locking wing nut similar to the Sirui. The Sirui has some confusing model numbers; the P-204S (and I believe the P224S) actually use shorter feet than the flagship P324S model which seems to be the one getting attention in reviews. It doesn't help that many retailers seem to be using the same stock image for all three models.  I don't own the Sirui but the larger feet on the P324S look awesome, I'm not keen on the idea of twist locks for the monopod however, it's a shame you can't buy the feet seperately! Personally I would go for the Benro A48FDS4; solid foot and snap locks for the monopod! I purchased the foot portion on it's own because I already had a monopod and head so I can't comment on the video head but I think the S6 head is probably overkill; S6 features like the counter balance are going to be useless on a monopod and it's just more weight to carry around.   As for the comments about the Manfrotto I would avoid it; it was the original video monopod but the foot is really basic with no option to lock and the video head can't pan like a normal manfrotto head (it pans on the foot instead, but other monopods can do both!). Hope that helps!"

It is hard enough picking one without having to make sure you chose the one you were looking for in the first place.   I think I will go with the Benro for a couple reasons:   It is cheaper in price If I am going to get a monopod with great stability I might as well get a tripod I am probably going to get a tripod at some point in the future.   As for the head I agree with what you are saying, it might be a bit of overkill. But if or when I end up getting a tripod (or really any other peripheral like a slider) I will be able to use it on that too. It is a small price difference too :P"

One thing however that I like about a monopod look is that it isn't completely still like a shoulder rig. The Surui however seems to offer that flexibility. The Sirui also looks like it would be more ideal for you if you were interested in more of tripod shots. I can think of a couple of times I was shooting a long toast during a wedding and could have used that extra stability. My only grip is I would need to by a tilt head for it.

Consider a countryman or rode lav.,I get a impressively clean signal from the G3 even directly into my camera so I'm sure it's even better with the DR-05 preamps and wav/etc use. I'd say the only reason to upgrade is if you want the strength of XLR, dual level recording or a recorder for a shotgun mic that is not a rode videomic or similar. Just be mindful that the Dr-60d and DR-70d have much lower battery life then the dr-05, plus I've had reliability issues with them as well as the H4n (H4n was used for a much longer time before having problems).

I believe, I remember it has a 5k or 6k sensor and is down res to 4k to give even better video. What kind of lenses are available for it currently? I might end up going with the 70d because the amazing auto focus. Even though I love 4K video."
videography,38l3h8,Rajminster,4,Thu Jun 4 22:27:54 2015 UTC,no.... shoot 4k.  2k is 2048 × 1536 pixels and 1080p is 1920x1080.  So not much of a difference between the two.  4k is 4096 × 3072 pixels so you would be able to push a good amount.  But remember it isnt as simple as re-framing.  When you push like this you really are showing the possible flaws in your focus.  So sure at full frame your actor may look in focus but when you push in all of a sudden they look somewhat out of focus.  If your resizing would you not just shook 4k?  Also 1080p can look great projected if its handled correctly and the projector is of higher quality than most.  Most major studios cut their films at 1080p.  A film I was on shot 4k but used 1080p DNX175 to edit with.  For all test screenings and up to the final color corrected print we used the 1080p resolution.  It always looked incredible even 100 feet wide.
videography,38l3h8,mellena,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:01:46 2015 UTC,Sorry I probably didn't phrase it the best I could. I want a resolution inbetween 2k and 4k. I'm not choosing 4k or 2k. I want resolution suggestions between both sizes ex 2560x1440.
videography,38l3h8,mellena,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:35:26 2015 UTC,"I see.  What is the point of this?  I would base this off your equipment.  More cameras have 4k than variable resolutions inbetween.  The gopro 2.7k is a somewhat a weird format because of the limitations of such a small and cheap device.  I dont see the point of shooting an ""intermediate"" resolution when you have the intention of resizing.  Why not shoot 4k.  Storage shouldnt be that much more in the budget and you get the huge resolution to reformat."
videography,38l3h8,mellena,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:01:24 2015 UTC,I'm shooting 4k  on my camera that's certain. I'm talking about editing resolution and delivery.
videography,38l3h8,smushkan,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:10:09 2015 UTC,There is no point to edit and finish to frame sizes that arent your delivery specs or on the flip side your camera resolution.  Why dont you edit in your delivery spec because you have the intention of resizing?  Or what the resolution of the projector is and match that.  I would say edit in your finishing format unless it over taxes your system because you will be resizing on the fly.  Editing to like 2.7 wouldnt give you a honest look of what your resized image will look like if your finishing format isnt 2.7k.
videography,38l3h8,ArtAdamsDP,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:34:52 2015 UTC,"Well what about a situation like this. I going to show my movie on 1080p projectors for sure, but I may also show the film on 4K projectors in the future. I just felt if I had a timeline like 2.7K, then I could downscale for 1080p or have sharper upscaled 4K. Upscaling a movie from a 1080p timeline would look so soft. Upscaling a 2.7K video would logically produce better looking 4K results. I wanted good flexibility either way."
videography,38l3h8,ArtAdamsDP,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:40:59 2015 UTC,Just deliver 1080p if that is what the client is expecting.  You're more likely to cause your client issues by sending a 2.5k/4k video than you are to impress them.
videography,38l3h8,ArtAdamsDP,1 point,Fri Jun 5 06:36:46 2015 UTC,Well that's the thing. I'm not delivering for a client. This is a personal short film project. That's why I wanted to play around with different possible settings since I'm in complete control. I wanted something like a 2.7K timeline so it would downscale to 1080p to upscale to 4K nicely. Using a 1080p timeline and upscaling to 4K if I needed would not look as good. Using a 4K timeline would eliminate the re framing control I wanted.

These are great for giving context and isolating subjects while dancing during the reception, respectively.   I wouldn't want to shoot a church ceremony without at least a 100mm+ lens, preferably two 200mm (one from back, one from the side). When doing the vows you want to have enough reach to really grab their reactions.  For stabilizers, get this: http://www.amazon.com/Manfrotto-561BHDV-1-Fluid-Video-Monopod/dp/B003YM04NO/ref=pd_sxp_f_pt. It's a dream. I'm on it whenever I'm not on my slider and tripods (which you'll want to get one or two of). The best part of that monopod is it lets you get some nice height.

I use a 17-50 on the d7100 and i love it. For stabilizers i use a shoulder rig from neewer. And i use the rode videomic. Not the greatest gear but for me it works.

videography,38jln2,crazycoala,5,Thu Jun 4 17:32:42 2015 UTC,"You need more than one battery. Preferably 4.  If you're doing sit-down interviews, you'll need a boompole, C-stand, and boom cradle, as well as an XLR cable. Also, good headphones (iPod earbuds are not OK.) If you're going to be outside for these interviews, a Rycote softie or blimp, as well as wind protection for the lav mic. Does the lav need to be wireless? A quality wired lav will be cheaper.  Also, you probably need lighting for your interviews. Two lights plus your bounce should do it. An Arri 650 and 300 fresnel will work well.  For your bounce card, you can get a c-stand and a duckbill clamp or foamcore holder, depending on what type of bounce it is. That way you don't need anyone to hold it."

Someone else mentioned lights, but I'd suggest getting a couple of bicolour LED panels instead, because:    They're light to carry They can put out plenty of light for interview content They can run off of V-Lock batteries and will last for hours   Just make sure you get a good brand like Dedo or do a colour test with them, as the cheaper ones aren't colour accurate and can have a green tinge at daylight setting. Grab a 1/4 magenta gel to go with it if you can't afford anything super high end, that's what I do and it works a treat.    Also get a set of quarter / half / full diffusion frames that you can mount between your light and subject on a c-stand, as this will help soften and wrap your light."
videography,38jln2,whutchamacallit,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:20:37 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a good list. Outside of misc accessories perhaps.  Comparing the BMCC against something like a C300 MKII isn't really a fair fight. : )  The C300 , particularly for interview stuff , will smoke the BMCC up and down from what I understand.  There's a school of thought that on interview stuff it's nice to have a two camera set up but that's up to you.  Matching the footage will take some time depending on what cameras you're using.  You might want to think about some lighting as well depending on how much interviewing you're doing.  Lens selection sounds good.  Perhaps a fast lens if you're doing something at night?  The sigma 18-35 has treated me really well.  The slider will definitely come in handy too btw.  My two cents.  If you have the budget though I'd definitely stick with the C300."

videography,38j8sz,lordnibbla,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:12:54 2015 UTC,"Here is my first test after initial tuning, thought you guys might like to see some progress.  I may want to try again with a wider lens, rokinon 12mm, but this was shot with the lumix 20mm  I'm sure that further debug tuning will yield smoother results, but I also do believe that the weight of the GH3 pushes the boundaries of what was intended and possible on this kit. The camera which the MFG intended for use with this kit (Nex 5) weighs in at 287g for the body. The GH3 on the other hand weighs in at 550g. The only reason this works at all on a smaller kit is because of the counterbalance that I have rigged to the frame. The weight I used is a bit heavier than what I needed, and this may be affecting performance. I ended up buying some smaller weights to put on, coming in the mail.  As you can see, not all of the footage is useable, and the parts that are smooth, still have minor oscillations in the yaw and roll axis. Further tuning may be required, but another route I may take would be to replace the roll and yaw motors (the two axis most strained by the weight) with a higher power gimbal motor as they are fairly inexpensive. I might just do that but I don't know how the alexmos would react to one or more non identical motors.  Another factor to consider is that I have no handle and am basically gripping the X plate at the base of the gimbal. If anyone has an idea for a strong handle, please let me know. Maybe 3d printed? Id like to store the battery in the handle obviously. That being said, there is definitely work to be done. Even youtube wasn't impressed.  The prices vary from seller to seller, but I got mine at the time for these prices. So to recap, I am using:  -DYS BLG3SN 3-Axis Brushless Gimbal Frame kit.

Grading is the stylization, which is when you change your colors to fit the mood of the scene. If you're doing this all in Premiere, I highly suggest color correcting every clip, and then adding an Adjustment Layer for grading. That will affect every clip underneath of it, so you can balance (color correct) an entire scene to match, then grade it all at once.  (As a side, you should note that h.264 does not retain a whole lot of information, so don't assume you can fix something in post.

videography,38i8nc,ArtAdamsDP,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:03:28 2015 UTC,thank you for the answer. What is the sort of gain applied? is it just analog gain like in DSLR (voltage gain) or another sort of gain? Because why is it so innovating if it is just analog gain? is it because the gain is applied in a circuit near the pixel so it's just amplifying signal without noise?  In Alexa the dual gain is just like iso in a DSLR?
videography,38i8nc,ArtAdamsDP,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:02:22 2015 UTC,"I think it's analog gain coming off the sensor, but you never know these days as the A/D converter is generally on the sensor itself.  They're always amplifying noise with gain, the question is... where does the noise go? No one seems to know except for the engineers at Panasonic.  Alexa takes a high gain and low gain signal off each photosite and blends them together, nothing like in a DSLR. A DSLR uses a combination of analog gain and digital gain to adjust one signal. Alexa takes two different signals and blends them together into one extended signal.  It's not HDR, though--it just allows them to reach to the ends of the sensor's dynamic range and get everything out of the sensor possible."

From Arri: ""DGA simultaneously provides two separate read-out paths from each pixel with different amplification. The first path contains the regular, highly amplified signal. The second path contains a signal with lower amplification, to capture the information that is clipped in the first path""  So in the Alexa, the technique of dual gain is used to gain firstly infos in highlight, infos that are clipped in the regular amplified signal, am i right?

Second, you may need signed waivers for locations and talent you don't have.  I'd approach your contact, and use this to raise your rate for future work. Let them know you'd be happy to sell them exclusive rights to the footage for an extra fee. If they ask why they'd pay this, explain that your current cost only covers the use of the footage in the single video you were contracted for.

Otherwise, if there's no mention of this, you're better off bringing it up in sense that it's a service you'd like to offer or that you wish to redraw your contract to make this perfectly clear in order to avoid conflicts. In the long run, you're relationship will be more fruitful and you'll come out looking knowledgable on the subject.  Otherwise, it makes no difference who owns the gear. You created the work, so it's your intellectual property as an artist."
videography,38erk5,VidyaGuy,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:48:29 2015 UTC,"If there is any evidence in writing that they are paying you for a specific job, that is considered 'work for hire' and legal precedent says the person or company doing the hiring owns the footage. It doesn't need to be a formal contract to form a binding agreement.   My expertise is primarily in still photography rather than video, so take this with a grain of salt, but in my experience this is absolutely incorrect, assuming that ""for a specific job"" means a specific gig, and not W2 employment.  If you are an employee of a company, that's different and work for hire is assumed if your duties include photography or videography.  However, if you are a contractor/1099, you own the rights to your work unless your contract states otherwise.  This is the default position of a non-W2 employee.  Work for hire is not the default position unless you are a W2 employee.   This applies to the US. I believe in the UK the person operating the camera, regardless of employment or ownership of equipment, is the owner of the footage/shots. There was an interesting case a couple years ago about a primate grabbing a nature photographer's camera and taking selfies. I don't know how it all ended up, but the original assumption was that the primate was the copyright owner of those photos.   This case was actually just last year, though the photos were taken in 2011. The images ended up with the photo being more-or-less public domain because the photos were taken by a crested black macaque (being the one who ""triggered"" the shutter release, according to the photographer - at first; he allegedly changed his story a couple of times), and the court found that, since the primate wasn't human, did not have rights to the photos either, and thus, didn't need to give others permission to use the photos.  No damages were awarded to the photographer and other media outlets successfully used the photos without a license."

videography,38erk5,ArtAdamsDP,2,Wed Jun 3 23:19:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, you should be able to use it on your reel. Be sensitive about timing, though. Most clients don't want you to release the final product before they do as it could affect their sales or prematurely divulge sensitive information.  However, selling it as stock footage as well as delivering it as a finished paid piece for a client strikes me as crossing a line. This kind of thing tends to be different to writing a magazine article, where it can be repurposed endlessly and everyone expects that because magazine articles don't pay well. If a client is paying you to shoot something for them they don't expect to see you making even more money by further peddling the footage they paid you to make.  I never sign contracts, although I work as a DP and not a production company and nobody asks me to. (My agent sends out deal memos but those cover pay and payment terms only. I often have to sign NDAs.) If they pay me, they own the work. If they don't pay me, then whoever is looking through the camera owns the work until they are paid, or at least that's how I understand copyright law. (IANAL.)"

videography,38dsg4,mutantlabor,5,Wed Jun 3 15:44:11 2015 UTC,"I shoot on a 5D3 and when I first started shooting professional projects that I was going to have graded (color corrected), my colorist told me about the Expose To The Right (ETTR) philosophy and how it should be applied when shooting a compressed video file.    ETTR basically means that you protect your highlights, and expose as bright as possible WITHOUT clipping. This essentially maximizes the amount of color information in the pixels, and gives you the most latitude in post.  Shooting flat profiles is fine, but the reason you're finding noise is probably because of exposure. You can always bring the exposure down (so long as you haven't clipped your highlights).  Another thing to look into is the native ISO of your camera. You may find that your preferred ISO isn't the cleanest channel, and by going up or down (ie 100 -> 160) may give you less noise.  Hope that helps!"
videography,38dsg4,FlashJordan,3,Wed Jun 3 17:18:23 2015 UTC,"Take special care with this advice, I have seen a lot of videos saying how 160 was better than 100 or any middle ISO. The reason of why you don't see noise is not because your camera has a ""native ISO"", its because the camera is shoting at 200 and lowering the exposure compensation to make it look like 160, so, you have some more light, but less details in the shadows, this results in darker blacks, this is why people see less noise."
videography,38dsg4,MrDuffman,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:32:31 2015 UTC,"ETTR is an awful strategy for grading. It means every single shot needs its own grade. It also means that, if you aren't doing the grading or if you aren't present for the grading, the results are not going to be predictable because the colorist has no idea what you really want because every shot is different.  It's also going to piss off a producer because grading every shot costs more money, as well as makes it look like you don't know how to expose shots consistently or well. If you're doing your job as a DP, the colorist should be able to grade the first wide shot, figure out what's going on, and only have to do minor tweaks to each additional shot, at least within a scene.  Also, ETTR means your noise levels change from shot to shot. If you're shooting two people talking across a table and one has a window in the background, the shot with the window is going to be noisier because you're going to expose for the window, not the person. The other shot will have less noise because you're exposing for the person. Changing noise levels between shots can be distracting.  I have to question the experience of a colorist who recommends ETTR."

videography,38dsg4,thuryguy,3,Wed Jun 3 15:52:08 2015 UTC,It sounds like you are grading in h.264 codec. You only want to color correct that kind of footage. Color grading is best with a RAW format. (Guessing h.264 because its a dslr)
videography,38dsg4,sparda4glol,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:01:41 2015 UTC,"I've not heard of a difference between grading and correcting. What's the difference?  I shoot with Cinestyle and it's great if I adjust brightness, usually I only need to darken, but adjusting color temperature is terrible whether I shoot flat or not."
videography,38dsg4,hotknifethrubuttah,8,Wed Jun 3 17:06:12 2015 UTC,"Alright so first off I attend film school as a post production major. So from what ""I"" have been told is that correcting typically focuses on a few elements of the image. For example fixing white balance, adding saturation, lowering the blacks. Color grading is the overall process of adding a look/filter over the now corrected image. So after correcting you experiment more with rgb curves, saturation curves, contrast all while maintaining proper video scope levels.  Note: check out scopes"
videography,38dsg4,sparda4glol,3,Wed Jun 3 17:11:46 2015 UTC,"Here's the trick...I shoot with cinestyle and have for a while now, it really heavily rely's on your native colour balance while shooting as well as your exposure. I tend to try to over-expose a bit, since my camera interprets darks really awkwardly.   USE RGB CURVES!!! Cinestyle is best used with a curves type of grading, rather than using a linear grade. Adobe CC actually has a Cinestyle colour corrector in their options, and it uses the same type of system as RGB curves. I rarely use the built in colour corrector if I have the option to use curves with cinestyle.   Cinestyle, thematically...Can work really well for you. It's tricky though and takes some getting used too.   Here's an example of something I shot in 45 minutes using a 60D with Cinestyle during ""Golden Hour"". It's not great, but I've had cinematographers who work in film ask me how I got the colour temperature and colour so rich for what I shot on...The trick was right time, right settings."
videography,38dsg4,OriJuice,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:55:16 2015 UTC,"I use Adobe CC. Is it in Premiere? I assume you mean something other than RGB curves, something specific for Cinestyle, right?"

The other things in the pack are good as well, but I specifically got it for this.  My bad! I've moved onto using FCP X primarily and haven't used CC for a while, so I forgot it was an add-on."

This should be obvious to any professional cinematographer, but yes.  Color temp is not adjustable in post unless you're working raw with a RED. Any other camera, and any other file format, including raw formats, do things to the data based on the camera's white balance settings that affect the recording to the point where you'll have a hard time seamlessly changing white balance later."

videography,38dsg4,OriJuice,2,Thu Jun 4 03:33:22 2015 UTC,"Technically, colour correction is about getting all of your shots/cameras to match, while colour grading is about giving a specific look to the image. In the real world, the terms are often used interchangeably."
videography,38dsg4,orismology,2,Wed Jun 3 23:46:23 2015 UTC,"adjusting color temperature is terrible whether I shoot flat or not.   You should never have to adjust color temp significantly in post. The only camera I know of where that's an option is RED, and they sacrifice some things to allow you to do that. With any other camera you have to white balance and get close, whether shooting raw or log, because a certain amount of information is baked in regardless and it's hard to change later.  With log the color temp is always baked in, so yes--you're going to have a hard time changing it unless you want to create an effect."
videography,38dsg4,ArtAdamsDP,3,Thu Jun 4 14:25:21 2015 UTC,"I have used Canon DSLRs with Cinestyle very extensively over the past 4 or 5 years.  There's only so much you can do. Heavily grading with flat profiles on the low bitrate Canon DSLRs is going to be noisy and filled with artifacts no matter what. Exposing to the right and making the footage overexposed so you can fix exposure in post helps, but using Red Giant's Denoiser II has been a mandatory part of my workflow for a long time. It's probably for the best if you stick with basic correction rather than heavy grading with them.  Recently I stopped using Cinestyle, though. It makes footage so flat (while not necessarily adding extra DR and latitude compared to other flat picture styles) and forces you to grade so much that it brings up noise everywhere. It was the first super flat profile developed in the early days of the 5D Mark II and while it became hugely popular, it really did kill some of your tones. Extremely flat profiles are good when you have enough data turn it into something better, with Canon DSLRs and H264 you just don't have that.   I have started using the ColorVision, ColorTech and Ive Lotus Film profiles. They're much less flat, have basically the same versatility and DR of the Cinestyle and requires you to do a lot less heavy grading. Their natural tones are much better than Cinestyle's.  Apart from that, you either use Magic Lantern's RAW (only really feasible on the 5D3) or move on to a BMCC or other newer cameras."

videography,38dsg4,rdz1986,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:19:52 2015 UTC,"DSLR cameras don't record raw data, they compress it. This compression removes a lot of data that would be useful for color grading. Typically you will have 8 bit, which is only 256 steps for each channel. Depending on the compression settings in camera, it could also do a lot of approximating, too, tossing out data for ""good enough"" replacements.  Since so much data is lost in the recording of the media, you want to record it with a profile that's most similar to your desired result. Try different camera profiles that are closer to what you want and see how the grading goes."

videography,38dsg4,jesusbunnyhasherpes,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:48:29 2015 UTC,"Post a frame grab from straight off the camera and one after you've graded it. No way to tell if you're doing something right or wrong otherwise. I grade all of my footage, h.264, prores, raw, and everything in between. You just have to know how to handle each format and how the camera behaves."
videography,38dsg4,nvaus,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:37:28 2015 UTC,"DSLRs typically record low color depth (8-bit) poorly color subsampled (4:2:0) low bit rate (25-35mb/s) files. The more you have to S-curve it, the more you pull the mid-tones apart and the faster you'll see all sorts of compression artifacts, banding, color errors, etc.  You're always better off shooting with a little bit of contrast, or S-curve, already applied. If you record the data that way then you don't have to pull the mid-tones apart so aggressively later.  That's why Canon C300s offer both log and Wide DR. Log is perfectly flat, and Wide DR has a bit of an S-curve to it but is still flat enough for a lot of flexibility in grading. As the file format is low bit rate and 8-bit Wide DR holds up a lot better in a grade. To get the same results in log you have to push the footage a lot, and sometimes it gives up.  I know a lot of people think that shooting flat on a DSLR is a good idea because it offers all sorts of crazy color grading possibilities, but the opposite is actually true. Shooting flat in a crappy file format does you no favors.  I usually just turn contrast all the way down when I shoot with a 5D. I've used fancy curves in the past but not had much luck with them. CineStyle tends to be the worst as it is the flattest: in theory it's awesome, but in reality not so much."

It's easy to chase the latest and greatest camera, but having the work to justify the purchase is another thing all together."

In the past year, I've had about 100 gigs, and I've never once been asked to shoot in 4k. That will change, but not anytime soon.   The external recorder is great if you will be shooting for broadcast or greenscreen however, if you are shooting for the web, it will be compressed and not really of much benefit.   Go for it. I bought the C100 a year ago and it was the best gear decision I have made. Canon isn't the top dog because of the features they offer. They have stayed on top because of the ergonomics, ease of use and most importantly, image quality. The mkii seems to add a few of the things that was lacking from the original.

After 5 months of C100 it was such a pain to use a 5DIII again, it's so needlessly manual I can't stand it.  The C100 is just an awesome workhorse, practical camera that is versatile for corporate, creative and wedding videos (I do all of these styles).  What was even nicer to learn is we bought a atomos ninja blade ($700) and a 500gb samsung ssd ($200) so $900 total or so and did a bunch of compression tests and found the C100's AVCHD compression was just minimally lesser than Apple Pro Res LT (and the higher versions as wells).  We will still use the ninja for green screen stuff, probably but it's not worth the bloated file size for minimal returns.   Also the true stereo audio recording is awesome and the auto limit on input works amazingly!   The handle grip is just genius and improves damn near all handheld shots. And of course the built in ND filters...just awesome.  For the price, it's a no-brainer and shoots well in low light and has that awesome Canon depth of field.  I know some guys love other cameras and demand 4k (although theres no real demand for it on the smaller corporate, creative and wedding market) but for the $5k or $6k investment...can't be beat for all around workhorse.

videography,38eeim,ignorethesquid,2,Wed Jun 3 21:08:14 2015 UTC,"I'm DP on a TV shoot up in alaska all summer and we picked up two of the mark IIs as our A cams. I've shot a ton of c300 and was sceptical to downgrade, but I prefer it now. Here's my reasoning  60p @ 1920x1080.  The bit rate is good (28mbs) and having on demand slow motion capabilities is great.   Built in ND filters. For run and gun this is incredibly helpful  Dual pixel autofocus. If you shoot with canon EF lenses this feature is amazing. I can throw it on a ronin or MoVi rig and not worry constantly about Focus.  Center tracking only but it's been great for single operating that when my AC isn't around or I don't have time to put on a FIZ and teradeck.   Good battery life, canon log color profile and decent on board audio mixing.   I picked this camera because of the documentary nature of this project and frequently needing to be an ""all in one"" camera team. It hasn't let me down this far and we're 2 months into production.   Things I don't like about it. It shoots into this weird avchd file that is just a single file when you put it in the reader. Canon has a utility to import individual clips or you can ""show package contents"" in finder to see the clip stream, but doing this strips some metadata like time code. I contacted canon about this issue and they said they were working on it, but it's been a few months now. Our editor found a workaround using prelude but I don't know the details.   The EVF is a vast improvement over original c100 but is fragile and has a strange coating on the eyepiece that scratches super easily. Be careful when cleaning it.  It's not very weather proof with oddly placed fan intakes/outtakes so invest in a rain jacket for it if you plan on shooting in inclement weather.   I shoot mostly on red/arri when I DP back home in New York, but I'm pleasantly surprised with the usability and image quality of this camera. Black magics new offerings may have better specs at the same price point, but this camera functions perfectly out of the box and the added benefit of AF sold me for this production.

I don't quite understand why people make purchasing decisions based on marketing alone... what Blackmagic announces and what actually shows up may be different. There may also be a deal breaker that's not listed in the marketing materials. Their build quality is not known to be spectacular."
videography,38eeim,ignorethesquid,2,Wed Jun 3 20:59:52 2015 UTC,"This.  I love black magic for trying to make high end specs affordable, but they tend to not deliver what's promised.  If you have access to a store/rental house that stocks different cameras, just go try them all out.  A specs sheet only gets you so far and I put a premium on usability.  The A7s for example, looks great on paper (and not to knock it, it's amazing) but it's tough pick it up and start shooting quality video.  It needs to be rigged and that costs money."
videography,38eeim,ArtAdamsDP,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:06:38 2015 UTC,"I love waiting until a camera has been out for a couple of weeks and then asking my favorite rental house their opinion. They have to make these things work, make them earn their keep and keep customers happy.  They learn very quickly what works and what doesn't.  For example, they bought a Blackmagic Cinema Camera, looked it over, and sent it back within a week. ""We're going to spend more time helping people figure out how to make this thing ergonomic than it's worth,"" they told me. ""Also, it's not built to undergo the kinds of stresses that rental cameras experience.""  For example, Blackmagic has a history of soldering connectors directly to circuit boards to save money, instead of building them with standoffs. That means that if someone steps on a cable you're not just breaking a connector, you're breaking the circuit board that it's attached to. That's a much bigger repair. They don't put that kind of thing in the marketing materials, you have to find that out on your own."
videography,38eeim,kingatrock,3,Thu Jun 4 13:55:18 2015 UTC,You have a valid reason for a possible price drop but camera prices always go down after release (eventually).  As for the Blackmagic gear...it's all unproven and untested by real world stuff. So it's a gamble which is something most freelance and corporate videographers avoid like the plague.

This is one of many pros.  It's possible to use Nikon lenses with Canon bodies by using an adapter. The other way around is not possible. Canon lenses won't fit on Nikon bodies.  I own a Nikon D5200 for video and I'm quite happy with the results it gets me.  You have probably seen this comparison: D3200 vs 600D, if not. It's a really helpful site!  For entering the filmmaking community, both the D3200 and the 600D will get you up and running. You can always decide later to switch to Canon (more expensive, totally my reason to start with Nikon), as you'll be able to use your Nikon lenses anyway."
videography,38e6pb,blurrywindows,3,Wed Jun 3 17:29:04 2015 UTC,"The 600D allows you to adjust aperture in Live View (video) mode, the D3200 does not.  In addition, the free Magic Lantern firmware modification for Canon cameras gives Canon DSLRs RAW recording capability, focus peaking, zebras, manual audio control, on-screen audio meters and a host of other video-centric features.  That said, if your principal interest is video, you should avoid Canon DSLRs in this price range.    They lack:   1080/50fps for smooth HD slow motion (they are all limited to 30 frames per second) 3840x2160p Ultra High Definition resolution (they are all limited to 1920x1080p) a usable viewfinder when you switch to ""Live View"" (video) mode compatibility with affordable power zoom lenses   Plus, they suffer from a phenomenon known as ""moire"" as the result of poor downscaling.  Panasonic G and GH cameras, for example, have a better downscaling algorithm. Here are a couple of side-by-sides between the Canon 60D and a moire-resistant Panasonic GH camera:   60D vs GH2 Moire Test Canon 60D vs Panasonic GH2 evil moiré test   Newer Canon cameras are not much better.  Here is a side-by-side between the Canon 60D and 70D:   Canon 70D and 60D moire comparison   Instead of a Canon DSLR, you might want to seriously consider the new £679.00 (with 14-42mm kit lens) Ultra High Definition Panasonic G7.  The Panasonic G7 has internal Ultra High Definition ""4K"" recording (4 times the resolution of Nikon and Canon DSLRs), 1080/50p HD recording for in-camera slow motion, an electronic viewfinder you can actually use for shooting video outdoors in bright sunlight (when a DSLR's LCD is likely to be washed out) and compatibility with affordable Panasonic power zoom lenses.  Here are a couple of early examples of what it can do (please watch at 2160p and your monitor's highest resolution):   LUMIX DMC-G7 Sample Video in 4K by Colin Witherill Panasonic Lumix G7 / G70 Launch - 4K - 4KPhoto Modes (shot in photo/video mode - each frame is an 8MP still photo)   If the G7's £679 cost is too high, you might want to seriously consider the £298.97 (with 14-42mm kit lens) Panasonic G6 instead.  The Panasonic G6 has 1080/50p recording for in-camera slow motion, an electronic viewfinder you can actually use for shooting video outdoors in bright sunlight (when a DSLR's LCD is likely to be washed out) and compatibility with affordable Panasonic power zoom lenses.

After I sold my Canon T2i (550D), I switched to Panasonic GH cameras.  I have all four of them, as pictured here.

If you're trying to promote that hashtag, what about keeping it up the whole time?  Music under vocal track?  Could you shoot a head shot of him saying his name? I get that it's the guy making the food, but he says his name, would like to see him.   Think about what makes a good food truck. Is it the truck or the person behind it? The focus is on him. Shoot him head on, at very least saying his name. My format for something like this would to ask a bunch of relevant questions in an interview, and then mix b-roll in.

videography,38col0,asosaki,1 point,Wed Jun 3 10:48:57 2015 UTC,"I'm a GH3/GH4 guy, and I've thought seriously about the Oly for the 5-axis IBIS, but I can't get past the 30 minute limit.  Every once in a blue moon I need my cameras to just sit in the back of the room and record something, and a 30 minute camera is pretty much useless.  So here's how I see the pros and cons for the EM-5 Mk II in your situation:  Pros - IBIS; you already have lenses for it  Cons - 30 minute limit; you'd be spending $1099 for a camera that gives you zero image quality improvement over your current camera (e.g., no 4K).  It would cost you $400 less to buy a $699 Nebula 4000 Lite for your GH3.  That would allow you to stabilize your GH3 (as seen here) in the short term - and give you an extra $400 in your pocket as a start on saving for a GH4 in the longer term.  Hope this is helpful and good luck!"
videography,38col0,HybridCamRev,1 point,Wed Jun 3 11:39:07 2015 UTC,"Agreed, the Oly will not give much quality improvements.   To OP: the GH4 has quite a few handy improvements over the 3 like focus peaking, 4K and improved slomo capabilities. The lack of stabilization in your lenses honestly isn't too big of a deal. In real-life shooting I hardly notice any problems using my Olympus 12 and 25mm primes on my GH4. Depending on your budget, a GH4 or Pana 12-35 may be a better investment."
videography,38col0,OC-photo,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:03:54 2015 UTC,The Nebula looks really cool. I had never heard of it before. Have you ever used it? What are your thoughts? Can you hear the motors as you use it?
videography,38col0,SleepingPodOne,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:30:16 2015 UTC,"The image quality of the video really pales in comparison to even the GH2. It's very soft, muddy, and there's even an extra crop factor once you start video mode (I think it's 2.3x, correct me if I'm wrong). If you want it for shots that need its stabilization, like tracking shots, it's very useful. The IBIS is game-changing.  But I would never, ever recommend replacing a far more capable camera like the GH3 with it. The Oly would be a good b-cam if anything. But there is a noticeable difference in IQ. Also HybridCamRev is right on the money. Get a stabilizing rig. That's a far better investment than a new camera."
videography,38e083,visacard,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:27:51 2015 UTC,So like the intro to Scrubs?  The easiest way to do that is to choreograph the actors movement like a dance making sure they hit their beats on the same mark. To make it extremely precise actually choreograph it to a song or a metronome so they can follow the beat easier. It would also help if you placed tape on the ground for their marks so that they knew where they had to be for each beat.   After that make sure your camera is locked down and then double check that it is locked. Hit record and have each person go through the sequence.   Then cut up the shot in your editor and align each track on top of each other and sync them up. If you used the song or a metronome it would be a lot easier because you would be able to use the wave forms as a mark. The you will be able to make the cuts between each person and it should appear to be changing between each person.  When it comes to the basketball though I would frame it in a way that you could mask it out and so have people continuing to change but keep the one shot of the basketball because getting that to sync up would require precise shooting on the actors part.

Block out weird shadows from the window. Give more depth to a face. Use it as an impromptu lenser for your camera.

videography,388bp7,claytakephotos,3,Tue Jun 2 19:39:35 2015 UTC,"I mostly shoot documentary work. Hands-down the most important pieces of kit are:  -Variable ND filter (Tiffen makes great ones, but Neewer has some decent ones on a budget)  -LED Light panel (specifically one that can be attached to a hotshoe)  -Monopod. I often have one attached to the bottom of my shoulder rig in case I ever feel the need to lock myself down. Quick, easy, and doesn't get in anyone's way.  I shoot on Micro 4/3 (GH3, GH4, GX7) and so far my favorite lens is the Panasonic Leica Summilux 15mm f/1.7. Holy shit does this lens pack in a lot of character. I also just generally recommend wides for video as it makes zooming with your feet a lot easier, you're far less restricted. Of course, a good telephoto zoom is always recommended, but I've found for my purposes a wide prime has never done me wrong. Also take a look at Sigma's 60mm f2.8 art lens. It's the best bang for your buck on the Micro 4/3 system (and Sony as well). It's a great lens for talking head-style interviews."

As for a lens, I would say a 70-200mm. Not only does it produce stunning portrait images, but allows you to shoot guests from further away with great effect. Less intrusive but still allowing you to get tighter shots. We use the Canon version but would happily recommended the cheaper Sigma or Tokina which both get good reviews."

Those things have seen a TON of use.  Most often I could just tie them between two stands and make an instant soft source for an interview or a small scene. In situations where I was confronted with a huge window to shoot out of I could do this and then line up every light I had behind the 6x6 for the firepower while blending them all into one source.  Mostly used full grid for keying, half grid for overhead sun and the ""lining up the lights"" trick above.

Also it's only 13-1400 depending on where you can get it from. I bought mine at Fry's for $1350. I really recommend this thing it's sweet.
videography,387gjf,greenhamster,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:55:53 2015 UTC,I second the recommendation for the Lenovo Y50. I have the older Y510P and it works great for video and gaming. I did have to replace the hard drive with in a year (probably due to editing red footage on a 90% full drive) and the second drive made a noise that worried me so I will replace it again this time with a SSD. For the money the Y50 is a great laptop. You can get it with a 4K display and 4GB graphics card for around $1400. I will mention that I think the build quality isn't great as the hinges creak and the bezel around the screen isn't perfectly flat but all I care about is what is under the hood. If I could afford it I would get a MacBook Pro but I can't justify the price.

And with a 256GB SSD you're going to want to get an external USB3 drive. Western Digital is sort of the standard in reliable hard drives. Here's something to get you started. And you could get any old USB 3.0 enclosure for that, but here's one anyway. You won't be as portable since you'll need power for the hard drive enclosure, but it's important to have a 7200rpm drive, and you won't get that in a portable external drive.  I'd also think about a good pair of headphones. These are my favorite. Good video comes off as amateur work if you have bad audio, and you've got to be able to hear well to know if your audio is good.  If I'm not mistaken, all of that is within your $1,500, and they are necessities."

videography,384n7z,jack3d--,0,Tue Jun 2 03:18:08 2015 UTC,"You're going to run into a problem if you intend to rent your equipment out - insurance companies will not want to cover you, or at least not for cheap.  From their perspective, your equipment could be damaged on a rental and you could claim it happened under your care and make a claim.  Whether you have insurance or not - you should NOT rent your equipment out unless the renter has their own insurance.  Also, if you are doing paid work or renting out your equipment you should think about incorporating - even if only as sole proprietorship.  Even if you are only doing short films for fun with your friends, you should think about incorporating.  You need at least SOME protection as there are a number of things you could possibly be sued for.  As far as insurance goes, your local insurance agent could help you get basic coverage of your equipment, but they are probably not suited to help with anything else related to your filmmaking needs.  And again, they will not cover your equipment if you plan to rent it out.  If you are a freelancer, or doing multiple projects a year (shorts, features, etc) you will want DICE insurance.  This will be able to cover all aspects of your business.  If you are working for another production company, you may be covered by their insurance while on a shoot - but it's not worth the risk.  Insurance companies never WANT to pay and will always try to find a way not to.  DICE insurance is an annual policy that can cover all aspects of your productions through the year.  The most basic, essential coverage is:   General liability: This covers you if some one is harmed on your set (crew, cast, or innocent bystander), or if you are anyone else in your production damages property.  The minimum is usually $1M aggregate (the most they will pay in damages during one year) with a $1,500-$2,500 deductible. Equipment insurance: Will cover your equipment while idle or on a shoot.  How much you want covered does not effect the premium as much as the value vs. deductible does.  Often they WILL cover equipment you intend to rent out if it is not a significant part of your business. Workers comp - its a requirement whether you have employees or hire freelancers.  If you ever hire a helping hand, you should have this.   One little accident can destroy your business and financially ruin you.  Incorporation and insurances significantly reduce your risk.  The thing is IT'S EXPENSIVE.  Between $4K-$5K/year for basic coverage (those three things), and rates are cheapest if you pay all up front.  It's an investment but it's in your company and it's what separates the pros from the amateurs.  More and more locations require insurance if you want to film in their space (even commercially like for an event or wedding) and permits are very difficult to get without it.    Plus, it can be a helpful marketing tool.  Production companies/videographers are a dime a dozen these days, and it's a race to the bottom when it comes to day rates and project budgets.  Insurance is a great way to justify higher (read: fair) rates for professional production work - a client may be tempted to go with the company charging bargain bin prices even if your work is better, but if you can provide better work AND reduce their risk, you're hired."

videography,382hi7,dinosawrsareawesome,2,Mon Jun 1 17:52:02 2015 UTC,"I always put the camera ahead of the lenses. I'm getting better at recognizing the looks of certain lenses now that I've gotten to know the cameras so well, and some of the differences are really startling... but you'd never know unless you compared them side by side.  For example, a week ago I had a three camera shoot: two cameras with Cooke primes, one camera with an Angenieux 24-290mm zoom. The Cookes were pleasantly and subtly warm, but the zoom was green by comparison. It was startling. On their own I'd never have noticed the difference, but together... wow.  I do occasionally get Zeiss Superspeeds for low budget shoots and I've come to recognize that they are severely compromised compared to older lenses (lots of barrel distortion and flare, plus softer overall) but unless you shot side by side with much better lenses the audience would likely never notice. I think they'd be much more clued in to the difference between shooting on an Alexa vs. a 5D, or good lighting vs. bad lighting."
videography,382hi7,Zpanzer,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:48:32 2015 UTC,"The only thing though is that a cheap lens will break, a good lens will last a life time. The investment in lenses still take priority for me because I will always be replacing cameras, but some lenses could theoretically last me decades.  ""Buy once cry once"" definitely applies to lenses, and you can do it without spending $10,000"
videography,382hi7,CwrwCymru,2,Tue Jun 2 01:44:09 2015 UTC,"Except I don't want a single 50mm lens, I want a matched kit of lenses, with the same t-stop and the same colour and look charictistics.  Also, I might need to do a smooth aperture change mid shot. My 1st ac is going to want something with real distance marks, that's not made of shitty plastic and that had the same size front to speed up lens changes.  Go with the dslr lens if you want, but you'll get less takes that will be worse. It's not about 'cinematographer street cred' it's not even about optics, it's about speed and consistency of production.  As an example, look at the aleax, it losses on paper specs to the red, but it works, every take. That's one of the reasons people keep going back to it.  TL:DR where do I put a lens gear on the nifty fifty?"
videography,382hi7,Rex_Lee,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:24:24 2015 UTC,on the focus ring of course
videography,382hi7,CwrwCymru,2,Tue Jun 2 17:00:21 2015 UTC,"Sure, when stopped down, well lit and uploaded to the web.  But if shot wide open, with focus pulls, on a big screen and in 4K I'm sure you'll notice a difference. It won't be staggering but there are good reasons filmmakers agonise over lenses."
videography,382hi7,btxtsf,2,Mon Jun 1 13:48:04 2015 UTC,On a big screen in 4k? How often does this happen for the average shooter?
videography,382hi7,hunteqthemighty,3,Mon Jun 1 15:01:49 2015 UTC,"Not often, if at all, but the average shooter isn't going to have $15,000 primes.  The video makes a good point that you don't need ludicrously priced lenses to get a good image, but a nifty fifty is not the same as a high-end cinema prime."
videography,386w5y,LessLoo,3,Tue Jun 2 07:39:29 2015 UTC,Honestly it looks pretty bad. The gopro shots don't look great because of the distortion and the colours are pretty desaturated despite your efforts with the colouring (green/ black and white) it still looks bland and amateur. It's a shame because the dancing and location looks good but the video is making not as interesting. The first half is framed poorly and you can only see the dancer's torso. I'd imagine that seeing their whole body instead of 5 feet of headroom (ceiling) would be more interesting. Dancing is very kinetic and relies on movement and your filming is countering that in bad way. I would suggest using a dslr to shoot your next one (not sure about your budget) and get many angles emphasize the dancing. You'll also get better colour out of it than indoor gopro stuff. Best of luck. Sorry for trashing the vid but I figured it would help.

videography,386w5y,Mr_Producer_Man,1 point,Wed Jun 3 08:12:05 2015 UTC,"The first thing I noticed is that your shots were way too long and way too wide. Music videos like edits to keep up the energy. More cuts on the beat to different angles. You only had one wide shot. If your equipment is just the gopro then you should switch it to narrow view and get right in your dancers faces. This will help bring some interesting material to the audience. You'll need to make them do more takes to achieve this. My first music video set I was on I was blown away at how many takes we did. It was 3, 12-14 hour days of shooting at a skatepark and different locations there"
videography,384lp2,sachio222,3,Mon Jun 1 20:34:20 2015 UTC,"Protip (not that I'm a pro, but it sounds cool): base your color correcting and grading on what you are trying to tell your audience.   In this shot I get the feeling that the guy who walks away just committed a murder and is fleeing the crime scene. I associate the raven with death (Edgar Allan Poe's fault maybe), and the cool colors tend to enhance this feeling of murder.  I like the sound effects. The music fits, but again, base it on what you want to tell the audience. It fits together with my post-killing scene.  If you are planning to use this shot in a movie, cut it. The shot is too long to be a single shot. Maybe use a close-up of the Raven or the murder victim, even the murder weapon or the feet of the suspect walking away."

Half days are done occasionally, five hours or less for 66-75% of the full day rate. Doing less than this will mean you're not going to make much money.  When you're getting set up you're working on their time, and you charge for that. If you're doing something that directly impacts the success of the shoot, you charge for that.  The exception to this is prep. I will often get a scout day but not a preproduction day, so there's lots of emails and phone calls that I can't bill for. But as soon as they make me show up somewhere, I charge for it.  So... 1-2 hours of emailing and calling, probably can't charge for that. The 30 minutes of setup... definitely charge for that.  Sounds like this guy was just being a dick and trying to wheedle some money out of you. You stayed firm, he caved. You might never hear from him again, or you may become his regular fill-in guy. I've seen it go either way. Sometimes people like to test other people. Or maybe he was going to charge the client for it but try to get you to give it away, so he could make a bit more. These things happen. Hard to say."

The ceremony, leaving the church, entering the reception, cutting the cake, groom/mother dance, bride/father dance. Don't worry about being creative. Just get a nicely composed shot of the imporant parts. Film a little extra for stuff to cut with.  I filmed my first wedding video two weeks ago as a guest. I sort of just brought my Gh3 and 1 fixed lens just for something to film and try out the 60fps. The bride and groom were pleasantly surprised.

With the 5diii, it shoots true 1080p at 24/30fps and then shoots at a little lower resolution for 60fps.

And given the rave reviews that the Lumix G and GH series have been getting, and that the FZ series is basically the same cameras but with a fixed lens, it should definitely do well by anyone who doesn't care about swapping lenses.  Alternatively, if 4K isn't necessary I'd recommend maybe the Lumix G6 instead. You can find the kit with the 14-42mm lens for about $500, it still produces good quality video, and one of my favorite features is focus peaking."
videography,3828hq,Kichigai,3,Mon Jun 1 19:18:56 2015 UTC,"Firstly I'd recommend finding any local videographers that could work within your budget. These online videos that a lot of people are putting out there do take time, money and a lot of effort. But if you guys want to do it in house, have time and are willing to learn - then it is achievable.  Audio is key to high quality videos, you could have the best image but if your audio sounds crap then people won't engage. Fortunately if you want a lapel mic you can get a pretty good wired one for not much money. I'd recommend the Giant squid (they do ship to the UK), you'll need a recorder to plug the mic into, I'd recommend the Zoom H1, it's cheap, robust an small enough to put in your back pocket while filming. The reviews of this setup are pretty good. This is about as cheap as you can get for decent sounding audio.  With the camera it really does come down to your budget, the cheapest you could get away with is a Canon 600D. The GH3 is also recommended. Check this out for an idea of good cameras but it is now slightly dated. If you have more of a budget for cameras, the sony A7s and panasonic GH4 are pretty hard to beat for price/performance ratio.  As for other kit a fluid head tripod/monopod is essential, manfrotto make good ones. Lights will really add quality to the videos if you're shooting indoors, a good LED panel will be useful but can get pricey if you buy a few. There are cheaper (but not professional) panels out there but do your research before buying so you know what you're getting.  To edit, iMovie is pretty good for beginners but if you want something more professional get final cut pro or adobe premier pro, both are good options. Other things to consider are lenses (the kit ones that come with the cameras tend to be awful), batteries, memory cards, a reflector, ND filter, slider, the list goes on but you don't need all of it, just get the tools for what you want.  All this stuff adds up, but you will be able to make multiple videos with it. Also, research on how to use the cameras and kit, they are not automatic cameras and will need to be used manually, check youtube out for guides."

videography,3813lx,achilleshightops,2,Mon Jun 1 02:20:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I came here to say much the same thing.   The Ronin-M is considerably lighter than the Ronin - about the same weight as the Birdycam, which is literally half the weight, and is the gimbal I use - but still, long shots with it will be a workout for the lats and rhomboids, not to mention the rest of the chain down the lower back.   I'm currently training with kettlebells to improve my general level of strength, and it looks like they train almost exactly the right muscles for gimbal usage. Recommended.   Other than that, you'll almost certainly need a monitor, which means you also need a monitor mounting solution. That'll be a bit expensive ($200) if you get the Ronin official one. You also need an ultra-lightweight HDMI cable - I think DJI do an official one - and possibly an improved HDMI mount for your camera to avoid the cable coming loose."

videography,37xdvj,needvape,0,Sun May 31 19:25:05 2015 UTC,"Forgive me if I'm wrong, but it doesn't seem like you've really thought this through!   Well, there are some aspects of us embarking on this endeavor that I didn't really think was relevant to the original post, but are to the points you've raised.  The profit on this would be tremendous. We have two realtors who have agreed to give us 5% of their closing costs if we can present them with a comprehensive online marketing plan for their properties. These videos are a major selling point of that. Since we've been able to get realtors to agree to terms like that, we've decided to put more focus into acquiring them as clients. We have a meeting in two weeks with a realtor who represents properties to the tune of $15,000,000 and seems receptive to offering us a percentage of his commission. Like I said, the profit would be tremendous.   And in that regard, hiring a local videography company doesn't fit into this mold because as soon as the agent sees a bunch of random guys and a logo of a videography company all of a sudden they are thinking, ""Wait, I could've just picked the phone and got a local video shooting company to do this?"" A lot of what we do has our clients convinced that we are some of the few who can do what we do, and good luck finding that diamond in the rough elsewhere. While I do truly believe that this is true for a lot of what we do, it might not be for other things (like videography). But if they start doubting the rarity of our services or the comprehensiveness of our skills in any regard, that's a problem.  Beyond that, videography is a skillset we have both always wanted proficiency in. Outside of being marketers, we are entrepreneurs that have a passion for staying at the forefront of emerging technologies. Online video has revolutionized many industries, and we believe it is still in its infancy. There is so much more to come, and we have numerous ideas we have been dying to execute on.   So yes, we don't expect to be great at this overnight and we realize how much of an undertaking it is. But as you can now see, this endeavor plays into a much bigger gameplan and we are willing to work out asses off to acquire this skillset. We have a month before we'd have to film our first property, are looking to rent a condo for that month to practice in, and are prepared to invest 40 hour workweeks into this alone."

You're the production company - but that doesn't mean you should have to do all the work!  Besides, your client will likely take you far more seriously if you are seen LEADING the production, not doing grunt work.  Hire professionals with professional gear who you can explain your vision to and will help you realize it.  Showing up with a dslr and a tripod is not going to impress any one and you likely won't be able to reproduce such a video with such little experience.  If the project is in fact worth that much money to you, invest accordingly.  Hire a DP (preferably with a camera), rent a pro cinema camera with great dynamic range (properly exposing interiors in natural light is hard!), grab some additional lights and/or modifiers, have a slider or dolly, etc etc.  TLDR: You want to add video production to your company, you must make a large investment for a large reward - invest in more than just a camera."

videography,37xdvj,SleepingPodOne,1 point,Sun May 31 12:47:31 2015 UTC,"From reading this and your reply to one of the posts in this thread, it sounds like your head is in the right place businesswise. I understand why you want to do this yourself and I applaud you for wanting to learn.  However, it sounds to me like you are going to bite off far more than you can chew. If this client really is as big and important to your business as you say they are, you're taking a major risk by jumping in to producing a video for them with so little experience.   My advice to you, as much as you may hate hearing it, is to hire someone to help you guys out. A lot of people have already said the same thing on this thread and I'm going to repeat it because I really do think that there right on the money. Listen to us. Be it a small production company or a one-man freelancer (based on what I'm hearing are your concerns about this, the latter may be a better choice), having someone who has years of experience under their belt will ultimately be a far better investment for your current endeavors than jumping into the field so quickly on such an important client. Hire someone on a per project basis, as an independent contractor. Don't deal with production company names or any of that, pay your freelancer well and if anyone asks, they work for you. I have done plenty of work in situations like that, having been hired by corporations (who don't have an in-house videographer) on a per project basis. When people ask, I say I am here for the corporation. Simple.   Now, you've invested your money in gear. I'm sure you want to use it on this next project. I'm sure whoever you hire to help you out won't mind if you come along and shoot some stuff. Maybe even ask for a few pointers. Some videographers might not like their client getting all up in what they do for a living, but most are helpful and like teaching people. That's how a lot of creatives are like. By all means, show up to the shoot, bring your gear, and shoot stuff. That's how you start learning, you simply shoot. I would say that it would be wise to let your videographer know beforehand (as in, before they're hired) this is something you're interested in doing so they're not surprised when you show up and start whipping out your camera and slider.  As for honing your craft, books and educational tools are just as important, if not more, than gear. You can have the fanciest camera and the most robust editing system, but if you don't understand composition, timing, lighting, and other elements that end up creating a pleasing product, none of that stuff is going to matter. I would take a look at the books from focal press. They're a publishing company that publishes a lot of educational/instructional books written by all kinds of professionals in various mediums. One book in particular is called ""the cinematographer's eye"". I recommend it to just about everyone looking to get in to film and video. It's an incredibly simple book that describes different types of shots, lenses, and most importantly, the concepts and reasons behind using different shots and focal lengths. The Filmmaker's Handbook is another book to check out, an essential guide to basics. I would check out focal press's website and look for books on editing, cinematography, and general theory.   So, back to what I was saying earlier: hire an independent contractor. Work with them, learn from them, and if possible, even pay them to consult you on future projects as you improve upon your craft. It's a far better investment of your time and money than to simply jump into this headfirst on an important client that is willing to fork over a large commission for your video. I'm not sure they'll be too happy about doing that if what you have put together is less than stellar.   I hope this was helpful! Please do update us on the route you end up taking."

Remember, when using a dslr for video, several factors of what/how you are shooting determine your exposure settings. If you are shooting at a frame rate of 24 or 25 fps, the 180 degree rule points you to using a shutter speed of 1/50. ISO, you generally want to stay in the native isos or their derivatives for your camera (look them up, easy to google).

However unless you get an expensive metabones adapter for the other mounts, you'll lose AF capabilities and any digital info provided by the lens to the camera (aside from the panasonic lenses).

You should think about accessories and other things you'll need to shoot video, especially with the GH4 which probably takes it out of the budget.

That said, if you want an EF mount and the ability to color grade, you might want to consider a used 2.5K Blackmagic Cinema Camera for about $1300 body only.  It requires more accessories than a DSLR to get up and running (e.g., an external battery, SSDs for storage and some sort of minimal rig), but its 10-bit ProRes and 12-bit RAW output are much more gradable than 8-bit DSLR footage, as seen here:   Prospect (Short Film) The Quiet City: Winter in Paris Lights Out - Who's There Film Challenge (2013)   If you prefer to stick with a DSLR and can stretch your budget by a few dollars, I recommend a used Canon 7D Mark II body.  Unlike lower priced Canon cameras, it has a headphone jack plus 1080/60p and is somewhat resistant to moire.  Video images from this camera are much more ""DSLR-like"" than from the Blackmagic, with limited dynamic range and lower resolution, but it does shoot at up to 1080/60p for full HD slow motion.  Here are a couple of examples of what it can do:   Canon 7D mark II Review – ""Herzilein"" ""Georgetown Walk"" - A Canon 7D Mark II Full HD Slow Motion Test Video   With an inexpensive lens such as a used Canon EF 40mm f2.8 for a little over $100, you will get decent image quality.  In my view, these are the best two EF mount cameras in your price range.  I have the Blackmagic Pocket, so I am a fan of the Blackmagic Cinema Camera's 10-bit ProRes.  It is a really high quality codec that is easy to edit and grade.  If you want to learn to shoot with a camera that is going to give you output that will stand up to grading, get the BMCC.  If you need to shoot stills, want 1080/60p slow motion or don't want to be bothered with external batteries and SSD storage, get the 7D Mark II.

So they get no notification of private messages, but they do get email notifications of posted responses.  I do it sometimes, partly to bump the post up to the top again if I think it deserves some more notice.  Also so that other people who come along later can see that there are responses, rather than just seeing posts with no replies.

videography,37prhg,SonofMiltiades,2,Fri May 29 14:32:45 2015 UTC,I've used the a7s on a few shoots now and I'm close to buying one.  The only thing stopping me is the problem you mentioned.  I usually dial in my WB on the 5dIII and end up with great results.  I did the same for the a7s and had such odd skin tones on one of my shoots.  The colours were much warmer than they should have been and generally just a bit off!  Have you found any workarounds for this or is it just a case of getting used to the camera?
videography,37prhg,scrivello,3,Fri May 29 14:40:37 2015 UTC,"I've been using the PicPro settings and getting pretty good results. Depending on the situation I'll have to go into the WB Grid and dial in some fine adjustments. Also for grading or on set in-camera adjustments, pick up the OneShot color chart (they have a pocket version too). It helps SOOOOO much with cameras like the a7s; especially if you have a monitor with waveform/vectorscope/parade.    I'm about to do a decently extensive tests to try and match the a7s to the FS7 (Cine EI, SGamut3.cine/Slog3, with the LC709TypeA LUT). I think we can get it close, if we can then I'll post something about it."

Biggest advantage for me is the huge range of weird and wonderful glass I can mount on the Sony because of the e-mount.  I prefer the colour from the Sony too, and the low light performance is superior.  Main let down of the Sony is the awful ergonomics especially the button placement.

I've pm'd the project from the start, so I know what the client wants and am the only one who knows the subject matter and what footage we roughly have. But there's no specific outline. It's going to be like putting together a documentary. I have to figure out how to tell the story in the editing room, which will take extra time.  For background, I've been a professional videographer/ video editor for 5 years. I'm a pretty quick editor. I've just never edited something with this much raw footage to sift through. I do shorter videos 99% of the time. I've edited lectures 30 minutes +, but those were obviously scripted...   I've no clue how long this is going to take to edit, PLUS they're asking for a quote before I start the work, so I can't time myself to figure out what the estimated time will be. Any ideas?

I think you are attempting it the HARD way... although it sounds like it will be much more PITA for them to try to bring in someone new, should they decided to replace you, so that's good?   You have 8 five minute segments... are they standalone? Or are they like chapters in a larger story?   One 'rule of thumb' I've heard for editing is that you double the total time spent shooting and that's how long it will take you to edit it, if you really have no clue then start from there."

The main reason is most of the features in ML are to get your dslr to have video camera options that most video cameras already have.  The big thing about ml is the sensor options but this is lost on most videoc cameras as the sensors are for the most part the size the need to be for the format in which they shoot.  IE a 1080p cam will have a 1080p sensor while a dslr might have an 20mp sensor that you are trying to shoot 1080p on.

videography,37pl1c,ArtAdamsDP,1 point,Fri May 29 17:18:06 2015 UTC,"Even if you shoot ""flat,"" you only have so much room to grade. If you're recording to an 8-bit format, you don't have a lot of room to push things around, and things like white balance can't always be completely corrected. This is true even in some raw formats.  Most important, though, is you can't change the direction or quality of the light.  Grading is important, but it's much more important to learn how to get the look as close as possible in camera. You won't always be grading your own footage, and if someone else is grading it and doesn't know what you were after they'll take it in directions you won't like."

videography,37qlwy,averynicehat,2,Fri May 29 16:54:31 2015 UTC,that didn't help.
videography,37qlwy,averynicehat,1 point,Fri May 29 17:01:42 2015 UTC,"Most DSLRs have pretty bad preamps on the audio inputs.  At least on the Canons I've used, if you have to turn the gain in the camera above 1%, you hear hiss.  The solution is to make sure your audio coming in is very hot (loud) which may require a more powerful preamp unit.  My Panasonic GH4's input is a little better - I can use button-battery powered lav mics directly that my canon's couldn't. Not sure how Nikon's inputs are, but since they trail the other brands in terms of their video features, I imagine it is probably a pretty poor audio input."
videography,37qzgd,Adrian_Maurud,1 point,Fri May 29 18:16:26 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it looks pretty choppy. That'll happen if you if you 1) go below 40% while filming 60p, or 2) have a lower shutter speed than double the frame rate."
videography,37qzgd,agills,2,Fri May 29 18:19:40 2015 UTC,At 20% i can see some frame skipping. But at 30% I think it looks smooth? Do my eyes just suck? Hahaha
videography,37qzgd,agills,1 point,Fri May 29 18:42:47 2015 UTC,"Well conforming 60p to 24p is basically the same as 40% speed. Anything less basically equates to less than 24p, hence the choppiness. Just never a good idea to go less than 24p, ya know? It's pretty noticeable (I'm looking on a macbook pro). I'd check your monitor settings to see if the refresh rate is too high or something?"

It's like $580ish per year. Throw in some professional liability insurance with unlimited COIs for locations and partners, and it adds like $800 a year for us within our city plus $35 per day outside our jurisdictional license.   For my other job we have enough capital that all of our equipment and vehicles are self-insured."
videography,37os12,hunteqthemighty,2,Fri May 29 08:25:23 2015 UTC,"It's probably because your personal insurance company is not experienced enough in insuring your type of company.  Industry-specific insurance (DICE) premiums can run up to $5K/year.  Insuring gear is great but liability insurance is what you really need - replacement cost on gear pales in comparison to what it may cost you if you damage a location or someone gets injured.  Some insure their companies through local insurance and for most things this is fine, but it is very general insurance and we all know that insurance companies love finding loopholes that get them out of paying.    If you do very only specific type of videography (weddings) then a simple policy may be fine.  If you do an assortment of projects (commericial, corporate, event, narrative), hire freelancers or have employees, contract out to other companies or are contracted by others - you want DICE.  It will cost you, but it's an investment in your business, has many benefits, and could one day save your company and yourself from ruin."
videography,37q3cf,TheJizzle,1 point,Fri May 29 14:37:15 2015 UTC,Cheap shotgun mics are not always a good option. You might want to look into a video-mic from Rode for example as you are going to mount the microphone on your camera anyway. You could go with a shotgun type http://cvp.com/index.php?t=product/rode_videomic-pro (if you really want a directional mic) or with the stereo-type mic http://cvp.com/index.php?t=product/rode_svmp (designed to pick up ambient sounds for example).
videography,37q3cf,blurrywindows,1 point,Fri May 29 14:50:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I only assumed I would be better off with a directional mic because the meetings are mic'd with a PA. The plan was to just aim the mic at the PA speaker. If I was maybe 50' from the person speaking, would a stereo mic from Rode be a better option in your opinion?"
videography,37q3cf,blurrywindows,1 point,Fri May 29 15:24:21 2015 UTC,"Since the audio is going trough a PA anyway, would it be possible to attach a recording device (laptop f.e.) to the PA output and record directly? Using a mic only costs more money and would not contribute to the audio quality.  If not, 50' is too far for any mic to pick up clean sound. You would need to put the mic closer to the speaker if at all possible."
videography,37q3cf,smushkan,1 point,Fri May 29 15:47:02 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I'm sure the PAs we're using have the ability to dump the sound out somehow, but there's a logistical issue there if the people doing the setups need to have it dumbed down.. The other problem I'm up against is if someone from the audience needs to speak, they will probably not be speaking into a mic, but we do want to capture that audio as well.   50 feet is a very high estimate in retrospect. I don't figure most people speaking would be further than 30.  With all of this information, it seems like I should be leaning toward a high quality stereo mic as the best option for balancing audio quality and setup complication. Does that sound right?"
videography,37q3cf,CwrwCymru,2,Fri May 29 16:18:27 2015 UTC,"Stick with a high quality mono mic. Stereo is completely pointless for this situation. If the PA system is nice and loud, you should be able to get away with a Videomic Pro, however keep in mind you'll also get audience noise.  As for recording the audience, you're not going to get good results at the back. At the very least you need a microphone auditorium front pointing backwards. Preferably two, and ideally you'd have a guy with a long boom pole running around at the back trying to get a mic to the audience member as quickly as possible.  If none of that is feasible, then I'd recommend that you consider changing your idea slightly. Transcribe the question as best you can and replace the audience member asking the question with a title card. That will make sure the question is nice and clear, and you can cut around non-camera-friendly audience members stumbling over their word and get to the meat of the question before presenting the answer."

videography,37lqac,lemnz,2,Fri May 29 10:08:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks man, when I first got the Diopter I didn't have any luck for some reason on my first use. Stubbornly I put it aside. Few weeks later I tried again and the moment I got usable focus on my 50mm with it I lost my shit. Here's the video from that moment. https://youtu.be/nc2ZCzHlPrA  As for answering your question, I'm away from my house so I can't look at it. I'll send you a pic and more info when I get home. I found it on Ebay, honestly I think it's off brand. You can easily find like +1 +2 +etc diopters online, but getting diopters that are like +.5 or +.7 is a fucking treasure hunt or at least was for me. These extreme low intensity diopters are what you need though to get that tasty focus."

videography,37n52y,_Shush,3,Thu May 28 21:19:59 2015 UTC,Blown highlights on DSLRs in non-log profiles and a low bitrate codecs are very hard to recover. You will also loose detail in those said highlights. The benefit of overexposing is that noise will be less noticeable in your shadows (unless you're overexposing by boosting your ISO).
videography,37n52y,arheff,4,Thu May 28 21:48:26 2015 UTC,"Under exposing is generally better as you're still going to get some detail, if you go over you're going to run the risk of losing some of that precious detail in the shot."

videography,37n52y,kpprobst,2,Thu May 28 22:54:35 2015 UTC,"Agreed, always slightly underexpose if you have to choose. You can recover more detail from shadows in post than highlights."
videography,37n52y,---D,2,Thu May 28 21:35:31 2015 UTC,"This is really a per case basis. If you can overexpose without blowing your highlights then it is more ideal because you are capturing more photons. More detail is captured in the higher stops of your dynamic range, and it gives you more flexibility and less noise in post.  It's more about what you're willing to sacrifice. If you have to blow some highlights to properly expose your skin tones, I would say that's worth it."
videography,37n52y,flugiston,1 point,Fri May 29 04:02:07 2015 UTC,"This is the correct answer. If you are boosting an underexposed shot in post you are also boosting the shadow noise. Generally speaking, expose correctly or as bright as possible without blowing your highlights. In post, it's better to crush your blacks than to lift them."
videography,37n52y,imagreatlistener,1 point,Fri May 29 08:14:37 2015 UTC,"Depends on scene/camera dynamic range. If scene is flat and camera is good, you can move a stop acording to histogram just dont go over by upping ASA. If cene is wide and camera is not so good you must choose what you are willing to loose - you can loose sky but you cannot loose details in shadows on subject's face or vv.  But you can easyly test it this way - compose a wide dynamic range scene (typcial for your work, or realy wide), than try filming it normal, under (1-2-3-4 stops) and over (1-2-3-4 stops) and do push and pull respectively. All test i've seen sugests it's better to underexpose."

Communication is key. They may not know what they want, and you will have to guide them through it. Maybe they are envisioning a highlight reel, maybe they want full-length shows each night, maybe they want behind-the-scenes stuff. Unless you talk to them, you won't know.

A good macro lens will cover you for close focus high magnification but your budget will determine the cameras available with a high frame rate.   Even a relatively high end cameras top out at 240fps unless you go for specialist expensive kit like the Phantom flex 4K but be warned it will cost upwards of $100,000 and will most likely be overkill for recording experiments.

Knowing none of that I suggest you look into the Phantom Miro M, it has a flip out LCD screen that you can use to adjust settings and use as a viewfinder, is powered off of Sony BP-U batteries so it doesn't have to be tethered making it portable, and you can do 1300fps at full HD.  I assume you are using SLR lenses already on your Phantom v5 so those can work on the Miro M as well if you get the right lens mount.  I highly suggest you call Vision Research and talk to them, they are super nice and can even setup demos at your university."

videography,37mhwn,PunitiveDmg,3,Thu May 28 18:35:44 2015 UTC,"The important thing is to get on the phone and talk to them - or even have a meeting where possible. You need to know that the supplier both has the ability to deliver what you're expecting, and that you'll be happy entering a long term working relationship with them.  It's all fine and good picking the cheapest price, but often inexperienced videographers will bid low to negate the fact that they can't prove that they can deliver. It doesn't mean that they can't, but unless they can prove to you that they're capable through examples or otherwise demonstrating their technical capability, you'll be taking a risk by under-spending. Try to find a supplier who can provide you examples of green screen work that they've done recently. They don't need to show you something that exactly matches what you want to make, but just something that shows they have the technical know-how to correctly light for keying which is a bit of a skill in its own right. Make sure that there isn't a green tint to the subjects feature, especially around the fringes of the talent as that is indicative of poor lighting.  Make sure that quotes are itemized so you know where the money is being spent. This will also allow you to compare individual elements and potentially ask them to drop parts if it's getting too expensive. Be wary of a supplier who gives you a flat rate without breaking down the costs, as this may suggest that they're either not properly considering all the elements that are required by the project, or that they're deliberately obfuscating their pricing.  As a guideline, I work for a higher-end production company, and for this brief we'd probably want two camera operators and an assistant. Assuming that you are able to provide the space in which to record, and we're reasonably local to you, you'd be looking at ~$170 half day rates for each operator, $100 for the assistant, $120 day rate for each camera, $150 for grip, lighting and sound, and $100 admin (delivery of rushes and transport); so ~$810 net per video.  If you are not able to provide a space in which to record, then you shouldn't be surprised if there is another $500-$1000 tacked on there for a studio. The most logical way to shoot a series of videos would be in a single block as opposed to being spread out over many months, so try to keep that in mind if it's practical to do so based on your content. If you go to a production company, they may be able to provide their own space at a discounted rate, but don't count on it.  If you're expecting a single videographer to do all the work, then you'll get a lower price - however personally I would not be comfortable bidding for this kind of work while only providing a single member of crew on the day as green screen isn't easy and quality may suffer as a result.  If you signed a contract to produce a series of videos instead of a one-off, there would be economy-of-scale discounts; possibly up to 25%-50%.  The TL:DR is to ask lots of questions, and try to pick a provide that not only offers a price that you're willing to pay, but that you feel comfortable is capable of achieving your vision. If you chose based on price alone, then chances are you'll end up with something underwhelming."
videography,37hv08,brazilliandanny,9,Wed May 27 19:19:49 2015 UTC,"I just moved from a Canon rebel t4i. The 7D MkII never made it into the picture for me, the moire and aliasing is pretty bad compared to the rest and it doesn't have any video features like focus peaking, zebras or histograms. I think Canon has neglected video in DSLRs for a few years in favour of the C range. I ended up tied between the GH4 and the Sony A7s with the shootout ending like this:  GH4 - $1400 + $500 metabones adaptor = $1900 USD   4K Works with APS-C lenses all the time touch screen better LCD with greater mobility than A7s 96fps @ 1080 Better colour than A7s Sharper than A7s at iso lower than 3200 Bad in low light without speed booster Good battery life New option for anamorphic lenses V-log coming   A7s - $2500 + $102 Commlite adaptor ($400 for Metabones) = $2600 USD   120fps @ 720, 60fps @ 1080 Works with APS-C lenses in APS-C mode no touch screen Can punch in while shooting to focus (glitchy) Harder to change settings - longer to set up Unprecidented low light Has S-log but requires stacks of ND filters in full light as SLOG requires 3200ISO Awful battery life No anamorphic mode   In the end the GH4 won out for me because the low light performance was the main draw for the A7s, but I have the Sigma 18-35mm 1.8 which comes down to 1.2 with the speed booster on the GH4 and performs as well as I ever need in low light. Andyax who I follow on youtube also made the sam choice and made a pretty good video about it.  So in my min that leaves you with the C100 MkII and the GH4. The C100 costs more than three times as much for no 4K, only 60fps and the only advantages are built in ND filters (which I'm fine putting on my lenses anyway) and xlr inputs, and I usually deal with audio externally."
videography,37hv08,Zukez,4,Wed May 27 20:16:46 2015 UTC,"The C100 only costs $3K now, so not as big a price gap as before. If slow mo is a big deal then the GH4 or a7s would be the way to go. I decided to with the GH4, with the speedbooster and 18-35 the main thing I feel like I'm missing is low light performance. I love the battery life of the GH4 and is honestly a bigger selling point for me then the 4K. If OP wants a great photo and video camera I think the way to go is the A7s, I'm not too fond of the gh4 for photography use."
videography,37hv08,AnthonyWithNoH,1 point,Wed May 27 21:40:14 2015 UTC,"I agree about the GH4 not being great for photo, in my mind it's a video camera that happens to look like a DSLR and can take photos. I find it's pretty good in low light with the 18-35mm that comes down to f/1.2 with the speed booster, this footage (not mine) is shot only under street lamps."

videography,37hv08,layzworm,2,Thu May 28 00:37:25 2015 UTC,"The A7s is so liberating in non-studio settings.  True, your Sigma lens acts live a 1.2 on your GH4, but what if you want more DOF?  With the A7s you just crank up the ISO to whatever you need to (up to 10k ISO imo) to make your desired f-stop work.   You no longer need to blind your interviewees or bring a ton of lighting gear to weddings/live events. You also have wonderful dynamic range. With a battery grip, the batteries last a long time.  It's really a non-issue with a battery grip. The menu is fine...there is a lot of options and does take a bit of getting used to, but it's broken into tabs. The punch in focus is not glitchy...I'm not sure what you mean tbh.   I've been using the a7s since it came out, and I love them...I'm sure you like your GH4, I was just giving you some feedback on your comparisons."
videography,37hv08,aaron2610,1 point,Thu May 28 00:28:05 2015 UTC,"I feel like they both have their advantages, it's easier to get a deeper DOF in any situation on the A7s, but most of the time I want to darken (use ND Filters) to be able to use a low aperture and shallow DOF, not lighten. Anytime I have to use an ND filter on the GH4 I would probably have to use three on the A7S, especially if was using S-log with minimum 3200 ISO. As for dynamic range I'd expect they're about the same as some people report more for one and others report the opposite. Apparently the soon to arrive V-log will also add two stops to the GH4. The glitchy punch in I mentioned was from Dave Dugdale's review, but I think it's fixed now."

I shoot on a t3i with the Sigma 18-35 f1.8 and am looking to upgrade to the gh4. Since the Sigma is technically an APS-C lens, will it still work with the speedbooster?"

videography,37hv08,iGotter,3,Thu May 28 01:10:54 2015 UTC,"Good choice. It is a very powerful tool in the right hands. It's spec sheet isn't fancy, but man is it a perfect work horse camera for virtually anything you throw at it but slow-mo. The built in ND filters are very valuable for any daylight shooting. The low light performance is great. Skin tones and picture are great right out of the camera vs the skin tones of the GH4 of which I'm not so fond."
videography,37hv08,bardomudo,1 point,Thu May 28 01:26:56 2015 UTC,"That's the exact reason I just went for a 5D Mark III with RAW. Actually bought it today.  I'll wait a bit until 4K cameras are vast and the technology is more accessible, cheaper and diverse.  The 5D's RAW may be less sharper than some other current cameras, especially the 4K ones, but it's still pretty damn good.   With the GH4 + metabones + 1.8 to 1.2 you're still dealing with limitations such as crop factor, terrible noise (consequently you're forced to stick with f/1.2 and DoF is too shallow all times), arguably bad colors and other minor things.  One year from now 4K will probably be so common most these problems will be solved. I think there's no need to rush for the first affordable 4K camera right now."
videography,37hv08,cruzz903,3,Thu May 28 03:56:59 2015 UTC,"i'm going to go ahead and state that whether you get the c100, the gh4 or another camera you will not be disappointed. The c100 is a bit more expensive but the overall usability and tools of the cam are insanely good. From what i have read and experienced myself, you will be able to use this camera in almost every situation and the Dynamic range is great. The GH4 is probably the most popular camera on this board and no, you will not be disappointed except for probably the low light performance. Using a speedbooster in combination with some fast primes might help you solve this problem. I'm guessing you have a few fast primes from what i read. Don't forget that the Panasonic line also has a few other great models like the GH3, G7 and a sub 5k usd 4k camcorder. I'm personally leaning towards sony myself, i feel like they are the future of cheap cinema with blackmagic as a close contender. Their a5100, a600, a7, a7s, fs700, fs7, fs5 line is a great line to climb in combination with their great e-mount glass or metabones adaptor makes for great footage.  If lowlight is your priority, look no further than the a7s, it's a little expensive though. But since the camera's you have listed are all aps-c camera's i will suggest the a5100. It does 1080p 60p. Great in low light, has the xavc-s codec. Only downside would be the usability. This is not to be taken lightly but if your camera are the whole time in the same settings, it's probably not a big deal. anw, goodluck."

I have the GH4, and it's a great camera for video in good light, but AF doesn't work with Canon glass and the Metabones Speed Booster.  You can use the new Kipon autofocusing adapter, but it doesn't give you the Speed Booster/focal reduction functions.  In your situation, I'd probably get the $3499 C100 with dual pixel AF and keep the 7D and Rebels for stills and B/C cams.  Hope this is helpful and good luck with your upgrade!"

videography,37hv08,Geronimouse,5,Thu May 28 09:01:36 2015 UTC,"If you're doing any kind of run and gun corporate work, interviews or documentary shooting, the C100 is the way to go.   The biggest three reasons are: professional audio, inbuilt tools for cinematography, and just sheer reliability.   This last one cannot be emphasized enough. I've been using it for almost 2 years I think now. It's never failed, died, malfunctioned or corrupted a card. It still works as well as the day I bought it.   I can't attest to the other cameras, but the C100 is a goddamn workhorse that can produce some beautiful images if you learn how to use it."
videography,37hv08,kingrichard336,2,Wed May 27 23:21:32 2015 UTC,I see the C100 has XLR inputs. How would the sound quality compare to an external recorder like a tascam or zoom?

videography,37jtcn,averynicehat,2,Thu May 28 03:35:27 2015 UTC,"I think that if you're going for an investigative interview or asking really hard hitting questions then including the interviewer is ok, but I mostly will breif my subjects before the interview starts and tell them to repeat the question or directly refer to people/places/things. It's easier to edit and is also more clear for the viewer."
videography,37jtcn,albatrawesome,1 point,Thu May 28 03:54:24 2015 UTC,"yeah, absolutely I agree.  I'm just wondering why in this documentary they didn't have a camera on the interviewer, or at LEAST mic her up?"
videography,37jtcn,smushkan,3,Thu May 28 04:07:04 2015 UTC,"They might have intended to get the subject to lead into questions - however not every subject is that great on camera, especially if they're talking about a sensitive topic.  Getting a subject to repeat a question that they've given a fantastic, emotional answer to just so that they can add a leading sentence often subtracts from the gravitas from the answer, and it's best just to bite the bullet and have to subtitle the interviewer.  The issue with micing up/pointing a camera at the interviewer is that firstly you need a talented, camera-friendly interviewer (often not the case if the interviewer is also operating the camera or keeping the client at bay), and also it sets a precedent for all the other interviews in your video that you need to have a visible, audible interviewer at all times which increases your work and may screw with your intended style."
videography,37jtcn,ddt9,2,Thu May 28 07:01:01 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's lazy. Lazy is a word I have a hard time applying to anyone who's made any documentary of feature length, because you simply can't be lazy and accomplish such a task. Leaving in the questions is a stylistic choice that I don't want to attach any kind of value judgments to.   One example of what I mean: Albert Maysles' last and most recent documentary, Iris. It's a gorgeous film about a fascinating woman. Maysles shoots the interviews handheld. Talking head interviews without a tripod? Blasphemy. He leaves in long cuts of his subject, Iris Apfel, offering him something to drink. Letting the audience see the person behind the camera? Completely unprofessional, to some. But the film is riveting, and thrilling, and gorgeous. If it's playing near you, go see it, and witness the final work of the man who invented direct cinema.   The only rules that exist are the ones you put on yourself. You break them when you feel you need to to give the audience a moment of beauty or honesty. That's the ""ecstatic truth"" documentarian and filmmaker Werner Herzog has repeatedly gotten in trouble for searching towards- the truth that lies beyond material fact and hints at the grander meaning he sees in reality. He personally asked the firefighters he was filming to reignite oil derricks that had been put out after weeks of hard work in the wake of the first gulf war- then concluded Lessons of Darkness by asking why they would reignite the fires they had spent so long fighting.   My point is, if it works, then it works. Always evaluate first how the entire project made you feel before questioning the aesthetic value of individual components of the project. If it succeeds at the former, however it achieves the latter was a success."

My suggestion of the light stand is because I put a dr-05 on it  as a backup and put it about a foot or foot and a half in front of the speaker and that quality is acceptable. The DJ should have an XLR, RCA or quarter inch out in one shape or another - just ask them if they can test it during cocktail hour before anyone enters.

The focus point isn't a focus point as much as its a big square/rectangle that can be moved around to a location of your choice. So again, not so much a ""focus point"".   As far as the ""one shot"" focus I'm not sure how different, if different, it is. I think it's the constant auto focus that the dual offers which is a little lacking in the terms that it really needs a hard edge to distinct what your focusing on.

Just play around until you get the feel for it.   the middle ground where most things look good is between 1/48 and 1/60. this is where you will spend most of your time.  as for upping your shutter to compensate for motion blur, yes it would compensate, but two things are wrong here, first it would dramatically change what the video looked like and two, if you are getting motion blur you are doing something wrong, ie not using a tripod, steady cam, arm etc.."

There were 24 framers per second and 180* rotary disk shutter - frame was moved for 1/48 of second and exposed for 1/48. Same way motion pictures was projected. So from that time we see this as a ""golden standart"" or ""the way movies are made"". If filmic look you want - you dont want every frame to be sharp, you want it blured incely.  Now you can use your eyes to decide witch look you want choppy short shutter or smooth normal shutter. You even can do long shutter, if your camera allows you to.

videography,37hg3d,Craig_BP,5,Wed May 27 17:39:36 2015 UTC,"Ya'll.  My clients don't demand 4k at all.  In fact, I could probably deliver 720p and they wouldn't notice.  But you know how awesome 4k is (on my GH4)?:  Cropping  I used to shoot interviews with two cameras (an EOS M at 22mm, and a t3i at 50mm) so that I could have two different shots to flip between.  This makes it extremely easy to cut segments of speech without obvious jump cuts.  The audience won't know you screwed with time.  So I got the GH4.  I shoot 4k and fairly wide.  I just use the one camera and it makes things super simple.  I film the interview.  In editing when I want to make a simple camera to camera cut, I just zoom in.  I've got the resolution to zoom in 2x with no loss.  It's almost as good as two separate cameras, but WAY simpler.  Yes, for a super important interview that I have time to set up multiple cams, I'll do that, but for quick stand-up interviews or clients that aren't paying enough for me to have an assistant to help me set up quickly, the GH4 and 4k let me do a much better job than I could with one 1080p camera, and almost as good a job as two cameras.    Plus, if my boom mic operator gets in my shot, I can easily just crop in a bit.  No big deal.  I did have to upgrade my PC that was previously capably of editing 1080 footage ok so that it could run 4k well though.    4k just makes my life a lot easier.  Plus the gh4's focus assists, unlimited filming, amazing battery life, not-shitty mic input - the GH4 has made my life so much easier after filming with low end Canon DSLR stuff."

One camera instead of two, the ability to ""fix it in post"" and time saved during production - at the end of the day, this translates quickly to the bottom line.  For me, (and others, it seems), 4K cameras may have cost more initially, but they have ended up saving a meaningful amount of time and money.

To understand this you will need to look at some underlying factors, like who will be using it?, who wants it to be used?, is it really better?, how is the technology. With that being said lets get to the point. 4k is DEFINITELY better than 1080p in terms of quality, there is no debating that. The technology is definitely here. Phones have 4k recording, dslr hybrids have in-camera 4k, the go pro's and sony sports cams have in-camera 4k, so i wouldn't expect anything less from future generations. As far as displays go, i just got an UHD tv 2 months ago for 560 euros (which is very cheap for a 42 inch). Phones are also on the 2k and i think maybe 4k on some? also, many laptops are starting to emerge from the 1080p standard into 2k etc. Infrastructure has long been a problem for video since video is very high bitrate material and broadcasting costs money. The most used source of 4k would be the internet i would say. For us videographers we might deliver on a USB stick in which case bitrate should not be a problem, but then again how is the user going to watch 4k? most likely they will plug it into the computer, most likely a laptop which will now have to decode very highly compressed 4k images or read slightly compressed big size 4k. Will these things even hold up? Either way, so why not just stick with 1080p since it looks just fine? well, probably because we haven't reached the absolute peak of technology just yet and because making a standard almost obsolete will drive people to upgrade, not all of them of course (i still deliver 480p on dvd's derp) but in the most part the newer camera's tv's etc will be ""better"". Which means that companies will sell more.  Also, lots of people are saying that it is useful for post production. Yes, this is true but it is only a very small percentage of people using 4k footage for this. Cropping as opposed to physically moving the camera costs more time. Using it for stabilization is an option but truth is, if you are using 4K to warp stabilize you are filming wrong. You might disagree with me but just remember that warp stabilizer cannot fix motion blur or perspective. So 2k might be a better option for this kind of stabilizing action. Other effects like mapping or whatever are probably unique to very specific videos. I'm going to go ahead and say that 95% of videos probably don't even have effects. And even if you needed the 4k you can just rent a top of the line camera for a fraction of the price.  So in conclusion 4K is not necessary but it is inevitably the future. Making 1080p videos in 5 or 6 years is still going to be ok but the standard will probably be 4K. Invest in sharp glass and wait for the 4k bodies to start rolling in."

Why not spend the extra little bit for the non-gimped camera?   Whether you need or can view 4K or not is moot; you don't master in 4K, you use it to your advantage in reframing, adjustments, and most importantly the resolution boost helps your 1080 picture immensely.

Without the optical part of the adapter, the lens acts as a macro. This will not get the whole table in focus, and would only be for really close detail shots. You could also get a macro adapter for your kit lens. If I were looking to drop $500-700 on a lens, I would get a better all purpose lens first, and go cheap with the macro for now."

From what I hear on forums, though, in terms of image quality the AX100 with the Sony audio capsule (http://www.amazon.com/Sony-Adaptor-Kit-with-Microphone/dp/B00NGTN1LM/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1432768997&sr=8-3&keywords=sony+xlrk) will yield similar aesthetic results for less money. This route is not without its sacrifices, however (no SDI, no 10 bit 4:2:2, etc). I cannot speak from experience on this, though  Bottom line: I like what the x70 gives me. I find for the price it is superior to the xa20 (might just be my opinion, though). And it is nice to have the option of 4k if I want it later (haven't needed it yet, though, heh."
videography,37i4ib,MacintoshEddie,1 point,Wed May 27 23:42:08 2015 UTC,"Well, I recently went through this debate and eventually decided on the XA20, partly because if I wanted to work with 4k I would quite probably end up sinking 4k into building a new workstation for it, and the XA20 was on sale for $1799 at the time, and everyone likes saving money.  So I suppose a major consideration is if you want 4k eventually or not, and what periphereal gear you would need to work with it."

videography,37e2ph,IronTek,1 point,Wed May 27 18:13:52 2015 UTC,I'm stoked to finally see this. It's really about time considering that some of their lower end mics already had this.
videography,37eue8,Ladyalona,6,Wed May 27 02:47:42 2015 UTC,"NX1, GH4, and probably a7s are what your looking at.  If you buy used Fred Miranda's FS often has A7s' around $1700-$1800 used. GH4 is usually around $1250 used at eBay and FM.  As for NX1, you could buy one from a Korean eBay seller and get it for a good price. That's what I did personally. No issues, no custom fees (Texan here), and it is a nice camera.  The AF works wonders if your in front of the camera just talking or vlogging about your day. In fact in a well lit room the continuous AF was nice for product video shots, but often times the NX1 would focus on my hand instead of the product/item. So I tend to use manual focus if I'm behind the camera.  GH4 is a beautiful camera, I rented it, but didn't like it.   GH4 Pro's:    Lots of aftermarket batteries from Wasabi and other 3rd party manufacturers. M43 mount with Speed Booster support and really any lens can be adapted.  4+ hours of battery life (while recording in 4k).  Many picture settings.  Swivel screen + looks beautiful Wonderful menu ui   What I didn't like about GH4:    Skin tones. AF was terrible.  More difficult to get shallow depth of field.  Speed Booster is good, but no AF. Kipon is releasing a GH4 adapter that costs less than Speed Booster and support AF, but again the AF is bad, especially in continuous AF mode.  2.3x crop factor is rough if you want wide shots of say products or items.   NX1 Pro's:    H.265, when converted using Rocky Mountain Convertor to Prores, is beautiful. Sharper than GH4, even with -10 sharpening.  Easy shallow depth of field.  Can charge NX1 via Micro-USB charger (think Android phone like Note 4 or LG G2). This means you don't have to remove the battery out of the camera like you do with GH4. Great AF. Continuous AF works well for item/product unboxings, and even better on one man talking in front of camera type of scenarios.  APS-C is great, especially if you want shallow depth of field easily. I can go down to F4 and still get a more shallow depth of field than a GH4 at F2.8. Crop factor is also a lot nicer, at 1.5x compared to full frame (A7s).    What I don't like about NX1:    Sometimes it's so sharp, that I get slight moire and aliasing on my shirt.  Software updates when installed reset all your settings. Including language! It was very frustrating having to read Korean to find language to change it back to English. If you do as I, and import a Korean version, you will want to keep this in mind:(. The reset required me to go and set it up properly all over again, EVERY settings was reset. I had to set shutter speed, recording settings, picture style etc all over again. A bit annoying, at least a warning beforehand would of been nice.  Battery life is not as good as GH4, expect it to be about as good as a Canon DSLR, err maybe a little better. But nowhere near as long as the GH4.  Third party accessories, such as batteries, is almost nonexistent. I have not found a NX1 third party battery at Amazon from a manufacturer that I trust (Wasabi, etc).  Questionable future support from Samsung No swivel screen   What I don't like about both cameras:   Poor lowlight performance when compared to A7s Less DR than a7s Both have a lower amount of native lenses than Canon/Nikon DSLRs Nearly the same price Take worse photos/stills (in my opinion) than a mid range Canon/Nikon DSLR.   If I remember anything else, I'll edit my comment and add it."

videography,37eue8,jorsixo,1 point,Thu May 28 07:43:11 2015 UTC,"sorry but i find the A7s a bit too overpriced, In my opinion the GH4 is allround a much better camera. the only thing the a7s beats the Gh4 with is the Low light,   But i agree with the cropfactor, which is something to keep in mind. you can get a 1,7F 20MM pretty cheap and with that lens i never had low light or crop factor issues.  Great summary by the way :)"
videography,37eue8,CwrwCymru,2,Wed May 27 08:17:21 2015 UTC,"I answered in a similar thread in /r/Filmmakers yesterday, hope this helps.  People are saying to go for Canons or Panasonic DSLRs, both have pros and cons. The panasonic range tends to be slightly better suited to video when comparing the cameras out of the box but a big factor people don't think about when recommending cameras is the glass.  Your glass is your long term investment not the body. This means lenses with an EF mount will be your best investment if you upgrade to a video camera with a super35 sensor later on as the MFT glass used on the panasonic cameras won't always cover a super35 sensor.  As for recommendations for glass I'd look into getting a few Rokinon cine primes, you don't need to get them all in one go but they are sharp and well suited to videography. The new canon nifty fifty would also be a good budget option.  For body recommendations I have the 5D markII (The mkIII is very similar, but can be hacked for 1080p RAW files) and I think it's brilliant, it's tough, dependable and weather sealed. The image is good and magic lantern makes it easy to use for video. Other good options for canon are the 7D, T5i or the T3i.  If you do decide to go down the panasonic route you can use EF lenses on a MFT mount with a speedbooster adapter.  As for audio, I have an NTG3 and I plug it into a Zoom H6 and I could not be happier, I doubt I will ever need another mic. Other good options are the NTG2, the H4N and I know tascam do a few good options too. If you want a budget lav setup, I'd recommend the Giant Squid paired with a H1, the reviews are quite good.  Now for extras, I'd recommend getting a fluid head tripod/monopod to begin with, manfrotto make very good options. A variable ND will come in very handy, as will a LED light panel. Other essentials are spare batteries, cards (get the fastest possible) and a nice bag.  I will add that the GH4, A7s, BMPCC and the BMCC might be covered by your budget depending on the extras you get, both can be adapted to EF glass and both are good cameras. I'd strongly encourage checking out a lot of reviews of every camera you are considering so you know the pros and cons of each camera, there are plenty on YouTube and Phillip Bloom does some good reviews on his blog."
videography,37eue8,CwrwCymru,1 point,Wed May 27 08:12:46 2015 UTC,"The 5DmII has a full frame sensor, right?   I really loved the BMCC when I looked it up, but probably out of my range. I noticed there's a 2.5 and 4k BMCC - do you know if its worth the extra money for the 4k? Realistically I don't think I'll project anything in the near future on such a big screen, but performance wise, is the camera better?  It seemed the Black Magic cameras both have small sensors, what's up with that?"
videography,37eue8,ddt9,1 point,Thu May 28 03:03:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah the 5DmkII is full frame. I haven't worked with either of the cameras so I can't really comment, I know that people like the Blackmagic cameras for the dynamic range and the strong codec/raw. But supposedly they are poor in low light and they are crop sensor."
videography,37eue8,Wurdan,1 point,Thu May 28 08:20:06 2015 UTC,"If your subjects will be sitting in a chair in a quiet room, a lav mic is great but not necessary. A boom held by a c-stand or something similar will probably be adequate. Just do yourself a favor and turn off the air conditioner beforehand, and find a willing participant to do some tests in your chosen space before the big interview. You want a dedicated recorder with proper XLR inputs whether you're going with a lavalier or boom system. Most everyone likes the Zoom H4N, and I personally like the Tascam DR-40. Most products by either company will be well regarded. The Zoom H1 isn't bad at all in a pinch if you can cleverly hide it off camera while also fairly close to your subject's mouth.  As for cameras- you can shoot really beautiful video with almost any video body. Your instinct toward prioritizing lenses is a good one, because if you pick the right ones they'll outlive the body by decades. Russian primes are popular right now with lots of videographers because they're very cheap, but I've had more bad experiences with them than good ones. A great investment for your interviews, if you plan to use natural light, is a reflector and stand."
videography,37eue8,Wurdan,1 point,Wed May 27 06:03:28 2015 UTC,"Other commenters have hit up the camera advice so let me touch on the audio side.   You can learn a lot about audio recording with just your H1 (mic placement / concealment, the importance of an ambient track and the difficulties of getting rid of background noises, how to sync audio and video, etc) but if you get serious about this you're going to want to look into a Zoom H4N or similar. A lot of pro audio mics are going to require powered XLR to operate, so you'll either be limited in your mic choice without them in your recorder or you'll also need to budget for a battery powered pre-amp with a line output.  Speaking of mic choice, investing in lav mics isn't a bad idea if you plan to do a lot of talking-head stuff or weddings, but be aware of the wired / wireless choice and the associated costs. If you're going to be shooting weddings then good quality wireless lavs for the ceremony are pretty crucial.  That said, for the project you describe in your post a boomed mic will also do perfectly well. One thing that should be mentioned if you go down the boom route is that a proper shotgun mic isn't necessarily the best option if you're recording indoors because they struggle with echos off the walls. A mic with a supercardioid pickup pattern seems to be the weapon of choice when recording indoors for that reason. We're getting into the niches of improving your audio recordings now, but it's good to be informed if you're buying gear that you intend to use for a long while.   Lastly on the topic of syncing audio and video, it's no real black magic. There are tools that attempt to do it automatically but they're not infallible. The most tried and tested means is still to do something in front of the camera which has a clearly defined visual and audio component. That's what film slates / clapperboards are for (in part), they create sound at the exact moment of a visual cue when the arm hits the board. You can probably guess what the budget equivalent is - clapping your hands once and clearly for the camera. After that it's just a case of pulling your video and audio into your NLE and lining up the spike in the audio waveform from clapping with the frame in which your hands come together. Recording audio using your onboard camera mic can help here and also provides some redundancy if your primary audio becomes corrupted / unusable.  Hope that helps, shout if you need more info or anything I explained was unclear."
videography,37eue8,HybridCamRev,1 point,Wed May 27 07:17:39 2015 UTC,"You're the best, thanks for touching on audio! I feel pretty comfortable with picking up the video, but I am terrified of messing up the sound! The worst is shooting a bunch of old people (realistically, my aunts and uncles who are all between 70-90yrs old) only to then find out the audio messed up.   Is there a reasonably priced mic with a supercardioid pattern that you recommend?"
videography,37eue8,HybridCamRev,1 point,Thu May 28 03:07:20 2015 UTC,"The problem is that reasonable means a lot of things to a lot of people :p  Given the other fundamentals you need to buy with your budget even some of the more affordable indoor mics like the Audio Technica AT4053b, Audix SCX1 HC or AKG Blue Line CK93 may be out of reach.  For this project where your subjects are likely to be quite stationary (70-90 year old aunts and uncles don't move too fast, in my experience) I think a lav set-up might get you the best quality for your buck. I haven't tried the Aspen lav that /u/HybridCamRev mentions below, but respected mic manufacturers like RODE and Audio Technica have come out with similar products so I'm sure with a bit of shopping around you can find a quality product that will fit your budget.  If you do want to go down the boom set-up route for future projects, then I'd say go for a second-hand shotgun like the RODE NTG-1 and just bite the bullet of slightly echo-y sound on indoor recordings until you can expand your arsenal. It's still going to be a million miles better than using any on-camera mic. Other things you'll need to budget for in this setup are a boom pole (obvious, but you'd be surprised how much a decent one can cost), recorder like a H4N (can usually be found second-hand), a XLR cable of sufficient length, a pair of headphones to monitor your recording (Sony MDR-7506 is the standard recommendation) and a C-stand or doughnuts to bribe a cousin into being your boom op for the day."

That 'upbeat' ukulele is everywhere. Every single kickstarter campaign starts off with that and it's become so generic and unoriginal that it makes me want to vomit. Other than that, great job."

We figured the craft cocktails crowd would want that kind of music anyway but still, you're pretty right here haha"
videography,37cckk,shepppard,1 point,Tue May 26 16:43:30 2015 UTC,Go to audiojungle and look at their best sellers under corporate. You're pretty much right though.   I always like to criticize the over use of the slider as well. Just cause you can... doesn't mean you should. It's like the modern day cross dissolve.
videography,37cckk,agent42b,1 point,Tue May 26 16:44:47 2015 UTC,So you felt we used excessive slider shots? Or you think we should've done away with them altogether?  Thanks for the feedback!
videography,37cckk,_Shush,6,Tue May 26 17:01:07 2015 UTC,"A bit on the excessive side. Sliders should be motivated and to be honest you diminish the overall value that it gives your final product by always using it. You want it to lend to people saying ""wow look how awesome that looks"" so if every shot it's a slider shot or the majority are then that wow factor is gone. I usually keep mine for reveal shots or beautiful highlight shots.  so when I'm trying to intro a scene I'll use it then I'll default to well framed broll, pull focuses, and ECUs. Then bam! Highlight shots with a slider and people think it looks great and by positive association  really want whatever is in frame. Nice and slow and hold that thing. Make them want it and like it.   That's how you sell it. Just my two cents though so take it for what it is"
videography,37cckk,tokuturfey,4,Wed May 27 02:28:25 2015 UTC,"Initially I honestly turned it off after about 5 seconds.  Happy ukulele music is definitely one of those things that you'll watch 10 years later and immediately realize how ""dated"" the video feels.    Then I read the top comment from GoLeePro427 and realized I should probably give it another chance.  Visuals are good.  Bars are hard to film properly because of the high contrast of dark/light, and your visuals look great.  Audio is a 6/10.  Too much air.  No compression or EQ.  The lack of expertise (both from production and post aspect) is noticeable.    Content wise... I'm going to be blunt, but obviously I am not really the target audience.  3 whole minutes of 'talking head' with BROLL used to cover up the edits?  Man.. I work on a daily TV entertainment news show...and not even hollywood stars get 3 full minutes to talk.  Boring.  I don't care.    The first line ""Cane Table is a restaurant and bar..."" -- ugh, yes, we can see that.  If you want to make this interesting you better not say what the visuals are already show.  Better yet, learn to make the visuals say as much as possible without resorting to a talking head.    Then... he goes off on a tangent about how it's ""not like other bars"" ...all unnecessary.  The only line that's important is ""it's like perpetual twilight.""  80% of this is not an engaging video.  It's a radioplay that happens to have some visuals on screen.    OK... so there's the criticism.    On the other hand: I get it.  It's a corporate video that the client paid for, and you produced as efficiently as possible while making sure the CLIENT likes it.  In that regard you've done a good job.  Client's love hearing themselves talk and often have a scewed view as to what is truly interesting and engaging.  Sometimes it's not your job is interfere with that bias, especially if you're trying to pay the bills on time."
videography,37cckk,thahamer,2,Wed May 27 12:45:30 2015 UTC,"I like it a lot! I think it definitely portrays the company well and gives a good idea on what to expect when you walk in as well as show the companies personality. The graphic work is nice and keeps up the pace, lighting fits the tone, slow motion shots are smooth and have a purpose instead of ""Let's use slow motion"".  The low light shots during business hours stick out to me. The bar must have been dark at the point as mentioned in the commentary which probably limited you to good video. It's still a noticeable drop in the quality of the rest of the video and makes the place look not as appealing. The shot at 1:04 also stands out. It's handheld and doesn't really fit the other camera movements you've done throughout the piece. If I had to guess, that's only one of the 5DII shots because the color and detail doesn't seem to match. As for music, I know that some people hate the genre since it's generic ukulele, but it works wonderfully for styles like this.   Overall though It's a good video and personally makes me want to check the place out."

Is the brief that the video should generate the required emotion in the viewer or is the emotion to be the subject of the video? Or both?  For me, the key to generating emotion in the viewer is music. Just as an example, take a slow tracking shot of, say, a dark wood. Add spooky or tense music you'll make the audience feel tense. Add mysterious music the audience will feel intrigued. Add a nursery rhyme sung by a child they'll feel fear.   These are just examples but for me music is the key to emotion."

I'd say get rid of those ugly black bars entirely, and maybe consolidate the POV shots to a single part of the ad. As it is the video is a bit long for an advertisement, so you definitely have some room to cut out more unnecessary POV shots (shifting to park, shot before door opens, waiting room shots should definitely be moved to earlier). I do like them though, but I think it would have more impact if there was one or two POV sections."

They also have guides of how much space is needed for each file type.    Please don't try to buy ""just enough"", you are begging for problems.    You might want to get 3tb  hard drives and copy to them each night. That will reduce the number of SSD needed.   Don't forget back ups."

Noted on the space requirements per their own materials.  I'm with you on the speed.  Budget is just a bit tight, but last time we had an event like this we were swapping drives from recorder to camera and lost some footage due to not enough space.  This is extremely helpful as I just didn't think about BM running their own tests.  I agree on the drives.  We'll do that and dump onto multiples.  Thanks again for the advice."
videography,37dbeh,youOWEme,2,Wed May 27 02:33:34 2015 UTC,"As far as storage is concerned: Do you have to shoot in 4K? I understand if this is a music event, but if it's just a conference would 1080p or 720p suffice? If so look into an SDI out recorder like an AJA KiPro and a 500GB drive per camera. 500GB can I believe suffice the 8 he day no problem. They're pretty inexpensive to rent. Just get an XLR run from your audio board and SDI out from camera."
videography,37dbeh,mexicojoe,1 point,Tue May 26 22:42:16 2015 UTC,"Hi, thx!  It's a medical event.  I hear you on 1080p which is what we've done in the past.  I got all excited about 4k as we were able to the BlackMagic pretty cheaply, but I do hear you in that it may be overkill.  It's not OR, but we'll be doing that too with this group on spine surgeries.    Good to know that on the SDI.  I just don't do this enough to be sure about the gear, and I can't screw it up (nor afford to outsource).  We have 2 Sony EX3s which we'll use with a data recorder and SDI.  I'll look at both drives you recommend and probably rent.  I have a Sound Devices Pix II (don't quote on the model / that's memory), which was 3kish a few years ago, but it's crapped out on me a few times and I'm just not 100% confident in it.  We have budget to pick up a few 500s to be sure / looks like Sandisk Pro is what others seem to use / at around $240 for a 480gb seems reasonable.  We've got the XLR from the board / all set on that.  Really appreciate your advice!  This isn't our main event, doing it for friends.  I didn't know about the AJA / will absolutely look that up."
videography,37dbeh,tn_notahick,3,Wed May 27 02:24:37 2015 UTC,"The Black Magic cameras are terrible for event work due to the the amount of storage space and their battery life alone. If you're that short on gear for the gig look into renting a camcorder, it'll likely make the shoot significantly easier."
videography,37dbeh,tn_notahick,3,Tue May 26 22:05:11 2015 UTC,Events usually have readily available power and I've yet to have a conference client request 4k. So you can shoot 1080p prores and have no issues with storage.
videography,37dbeh,swaggums,1 point,Tue May 26 23:59:50 2015 UTC,"Actually, this is super helpful because I kindof forgot about the fact that 4k is x multiples more data than 1080p.  That kindof went over my head.  So, you're absolutely right, I should use the 4k sparingly for live stuff and use 1080p the rest, which is what we've done in the past.  We're somewhat making up the rules for the client and this is somewhat of prep work for a global symposium on spine surgery (wherein the 4k in labs will be consistent with expectation).  I'll downgrade and not go insane on storage."
videography,37dbeh,swaggums,1 point,Wed May 27 02:30:08 2015 UTC,Not a problem.  I think the specs are 20 minutes on 256gb drive shooting raw 4k. 1080 you'll get roughly 4x more and iirc 8x more using prores. I may be off but I believe you can get 10 hours plus on 256gb.   I get about about hour on 25gb on my dslr  using h.264 in 1080p so that checks out about right consisting I believe prores is a little smaller.

If you have more than two sources, you will need an audio mixer.  I've used the VidiU and a Verizon MiFi hotspot to stream. We have a pay-as-you-go plan, which (if you have a line of credit with Verizon) won't get throttled if you go over your monthly allotment of 10GB. We streamed for three days straight and used about 16GB of data in that weekend.  The drawback of the VidiU is that there's no confidence monitoring. You will still need another device to monitor everything on. If you were to use a computer you could simply open your web page there and view your stream.  In terms of a computer-based solution, Blackmagic's website lists approved PC laptops for the Intensity Shuttle USB 3.0, and a couple Dell models are listed there. A small desktop with a capture card like the Mini Recorder would also work. Since the Mini Recorder is a half-width card you can fit it into a slim case."

I work for an agency that produces some local television shows as well as ad work.

I will say I am likely not an average example since I have a day job doing video work for a University in my town, but I make enough from side work and freelance gigs in town that I could survive if I just did that. I don't do weddings and very very rarely do event/conference type stuff - my main gigs are usually producing videos for local and regional entities (non profits, golf courses, gyms, boutique shops, restaurants, the township/local governments, some utility-esque companies, a bit of industrial work). My typical work area covers the town I live in and the 3 similarly sized markets each within 60 miles, but 9/10 projects are in my community. I really enjoy the opportunities I get with a smaller town - yeah, really high end corporate work and getting to hire a crew for every shoot would be awesome, but the trade off is living in a smaller, quieter area, and I get to be a big fish in a small pond."

If there is any wind at all I don't think the footage is going to be very stable coming out of this thing.  But I'll reserve judgement until I see a production model and how it performs.

It may be dumb but NEVER drag drop, yes it'll work 99.08% of the time flawlessly but that .02% where it corrupts or misinterprets the file could be brutal.    IF you have no other choice than to drag drop, make sure you copy the entire card structure, not just the folder with the video fils in it."

videography,37bp9c,pimpedoutjedi,1 point,Wed May 27 08:16:00 2015 UTC,"You can if you don't wipe the cards but I've not seen many shows that hold digital media until the editor has the footage and has started cutting, one of the main features of digital media is the shoot/wipe/reuse nature of it.  Your DIT/Data Manager could spot check/visually verify until transcodes are done, if they are desired, but that's time consuming and monotonous.  I've gotten producers questioning the why I don't just drag and drop, as they've ""done on every other show"" and I explain as best I can. (Bonus: they see that I care about my job & want to put the best possible version of it on the table and they appreciate it and remember for the next show)  Again were talking about .02% here, that's something like 5000:1 odds something will go wrong.  All computer files have an inherent chance to corrupt, whether it be via transfer, editing, or just viewing - it's all 1s & 0s.  When so many people have put energy, talent, and money into a project, I'd rather be safe and use an MD5 or at the very least a file size comparison.

If your principal interest is video, you should avoid Canon DSLRs in this price range.    They lack:   1080/60fps for smooth HD slow motion (they are all limited to 30 frames per second) 3840x2160p Ultra High Definition resolution (they are all limited to 1920x1080p) the ability to record for more than 12 or 30 minutes continuously a usable viewfinder when you switch to ""Live View"" (video) mode compatibility with affordable power zoom lenses   Plus, they suffer from a phenomenon known as ""moire"" as the result of poor downscaling.  Panasonic G and GH cameras, for example, have a better downscaling algorithm. Here are a couple of side-by-sides between the Canon 60D and a moire-resistant Panasonic GH camera:   60D vs GH2 Moire Test Canon 60D vs Panasonic GH2 evil moiré test   Newer Canon cameras are not much better.  Here is a side-by-side between the Canon 60D and 70D:   Canon 70D and 60D moire comparison   Instead of a Canon DSLR, you might want to seriously consider the new $799.99 (with 14-42mm kit lens) Ultra High Definition Panasonic G7.  The Panasonic G7 has internal Ultra High Definition ""4K"" recording, 1080/60p HD recording for in-camera slow motion, the ability to record for over an hour continuously, an electronic viewfinder you can actually use for shooting video outdoors in bright sunlight (when a DSLR's LCD is likely to be washed out) and compatibility with affordable Panasonic power zoom lenses.  Here are a couple of early examples of what it can do (please watch at 2160p and your monitor's highest resolution):   LUMIX DMC-G7 Sample Video in 4K by Colin Witherill Panasonic Lumix G7 / G70 Launch - 4K - 4KPhoto Modes (shot in photo/video mode - each frame is an 8MP still photo)   To be fair, Canons in this price range are better still cameras - but Panasonic G and GH cameras are the better all-around choice for both video and stills.  After I sold my Canon T2i, I switched to Panasonic GH cameras.  I have all four of them, as pictured here.    In my experience, they are the best value-for-money video/still hybrid cameras you can buy.  Hope this is helpful and good luck with your decision!"

That being said, it will have more rolling shutter, moire, and aliasing than the GH4 at the expense of having sharper video. The NX1 also records at 80mbs h.265 which is about equal to 160-200mbs h264. That's nearly twice the rate of the GH4."

The only problem is the stupid electronic only focus Canon uses on the cheaper lenses, where you can't mark focus points because it's not mechanical and the speed with which you turn the focus ring effects how much of a change is made in the focus, rather than it only being changed by how far you turn the focus ring. I've now moved to the Canon EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM lens because of it."

After that I choose the most average frame from a shot, edit it and apply a film emulation preset designed for photos. Then I lift all those settings and apply them to every frame in the shot and move onto the next set of images that make up the next shot. When I'm done I export all the images from aperture and bring all the edited jpegs into compressor as an image sequence to turn them back into a video. After that I place the original video back on top of the original in final cut. I'm about to move to Da Vinci Resolve to see if I can get a similar result."

videography,379f44,maxlifeliving,5,Mon May 25 23:15:50 2015 UTC,I'd say go with the T3i.  Canon is generally better for a mix of videography and photography work as the UI and support are more geared towards that (Magic Lantern hack/etc). Seems to be more up your alley seeing as you want to do more video work. Nikon DSLRs lack some video features (like changing aperture in live view) but are generally better for just photography (in general more autofocus points/low light performance).
videography,379f44,AlexFungsta,3,Tue May 26 02:37:10 2015 UTC,"Take the T3i. However, if you'd put in a couple hundred more, you can get a badass T5i kit with 2 lenses, 2 tripods, and a shit ton of other accessories on Amazon.com for like $750.

videography,378b72,catilinochka,3,Mon May 25 18:24:00 2015 UTC,"For long slow pans, a good tripod is a must.  I would argue that's all you really need. Travel light and make the best use of your time, without carrying a million pieces of gear.  If it were me, I would buy a carbon fiber travel tripod with 2 stage legs that also fold outwards, and a small fluid head. Lightweight, fast to set up, and versatile.   With a tripod like this you can get your locked down shots, extend one leg to use like a monopod, or fold one leg backwards to use as a makeshift steadycam rig. I have shot this way quite often and get great results. Plus there is something liberating about only carrying one bag and tripod. If you have one piece of support gear, you'll become very skilled in making the best use of it.  The only weakness in this setup is the moving shots, which aren't as steady as a gimbal type device. But it takes a lot of practice to get good with those anyway."
videography,378b72,fluvaccine,1 point,Mon May 25 19:12:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your answer!  Do you have any well-known examples of the type of tripod you mentioned, so that i can look into it?"
videography,378b72,smushkan,3,Mon May 25 19:19:15 2015 UTC,"I'm not the guy above, but the lightweight tripod that I use the most is the Miller SOLO DV-20.  Really, anything with a fluid head will serve you well, so you don't need to spend that much - but it's nice to. Remember, a good tripod will last you for your entire career, and if it's a reputable brand like Manfrotto, Vinten, or Miller, service and parts are cheap (not that you'll need them frequently)"
videography,378b72,The_Ace,2,Mon May 25 20:28:28 2015 UTC,"i'm sure you're right and i certainly get the logic behind what you're saying, but i simply don't have the means for such an investment. I should've specified my budget for this : it is around 200 euros , so roughly 220$. I've come to realise you just can't get a good video tripod+head for that kind of price, but you can get a decent shoulder rig or handheld gimbal type device. This is what my wall of text was circling around!  edit : i should specify what rig and steadycam type thing i'm thinking of : the ""spider rig"", and the ""sturdycam"" by sturdyshots which is an italian company that gets excellent reviews as far as i know, or, and this is less appealing to me, the ""Flyboy III"" Flycam."
videography,378b72,klaqua,1 point,Mon May 25 21:49:45 2015 UTC,"I feel like the cheap steadicams are not as good as you are expecting. Notice for example that the Flycam product photos usually have a small camera like gopro, bmpcc, or camcorder mounted. Although you didn't mention what you are shooting with? Also steadicams may need a lot of practice to operate smoothly and maybe not as easy as you hope for run&gun shooting.  I also second the suggestion of just getting a good tripod and doing it all just with that. Have a look at the Benro 'travel angel' series, which have a removable leg to use as a monopod. I see a nice kit with a basic video fluid head here which might be in your budget: http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1080216-REG/benro_a2883fs4_aero4_travel_angel_video.html  And do you have an IS/VR lens on your camera? They can make handholding a lot easier. I've done quite a bit with the 12-35/2.8 panasonic lens (with IS) on a GH4, using either a monopod held in my armpit as a basic shoulder rig, or even a gorillapod is very handy - you can turn one leg into a front handle, and brace the other two on your shoulder. You can do this with a cheap ball head too rather than a fluid head."

As you suggest, i'll probably be using the former for all handheld shots because of the IS and because of its versatility."

Meaning with your regular lenses, they project a standard, normal looking image. Versus an anamorphic lens, which projects a squished image that can then be stretched in post to give the aspect ratio.  You can crop a regular 16:9 image to 2.39:1 in post (and sometimes in camera), but the anamorphic lenses physically alter the light in various ways to give it a certain look and feel. The anamorphic lens flares are a perfect example of this."

I'm talking about taking a regular old lens and then simply replacing the iris (or adding another iris) that is elliptical, rather than circular."
videography,377g6o,pogden,1 point,Mon May 25 16:54:42 2015 UTC,"Anamorphism (for video and cinema) literally means changing the aspect ratio of the light image itself via lens. Its not about the proportions of the sensor or recorded image. They have to not match for it to be considered anamorphic. If you crop in or have a sensor shaped like your final output, then that is not anamorphic. Anamorphic lenses squeeze in a wider field of view onto film or a sensor of a different aspect ratio than your final product. This is why you get non-square pixels when working with an a morphism digitally. Back in the day you'd have a de-squeeze lens on your projector to correct the image.  Its important to note that a lot of the look of anamorphism is in the aspherical lenses providing unique distortions, bends in the plane of focus and depth of field, chromatic aberrations, wild flares and internal reflections (hence the big matte boxes that are often unnecessary for modern multicoated non-anamorphic lenses). There are many qualities that are desirable with anamorphic lenses."
videography,377g6o,blickblocks,1 point,Mon May 25 18:06:52 2015 UTC,"Anamorphic isn't an aspect ratio, it's a lens design with a squeeze factor built in. Typically that squeeze is 2:1. In film days, with a film gate that had a 1.2:1 aspect ratio, you'd end up with a 2.4:1 image squeezed into a 1.2:1 image on the film. This was a cheaper way to get 70mm wide screen aspect ratios on 35mm film.   The aspect ratio of 2.4:1 can be captured with flat (or spherical, non-anamorphic) lenses if the combined resolution of the lens and film/sensor are high enough. This used to be called Super 35mm, although that has come to mean something else now.  Now S35 refers to a sensor that is 3 film perfs tall, instead of 4 film perfs. The normal Academy aperture film image that was 4 perfs tall wasn't needed when capturing a wide (1.85:1, 1.77:1, 2.4:1) frame, so S35 refers to the 3-perf image size that most sensors emulate.  Anamorphic optics change the image in crazy ways that you don't see when using flat/spherical lenses. That's why they're so popular. You don't get the same effects when simply shooting in a 2.4:1 aspect ratio.  Relevant Wikipedia article."

videography,377g6o,devlinski,2,Mon May 25 17:33:14 2015 UTC,Besides most lenses being heavy? It adds post work since the output aren't put through an projector anamorphic lens squeezing the image back.  I am not very into VFX but I can see being it more complicated to replicate the look of it.
videography,377g6o,RobintheLarge,1 point,Mon May 25 18:43:09 2015 UTC,I work with Avid myself so I'm just wondering does the squeezing of an anamorphic image back in post not degrade the picture?

videography,377g6o,devlinski,2,Mon May 25 19:05:33 2015 UTC,It should not degrade. The whole point of shooting anamorphic the analog way is to use every pixel (or film.) I am unsure about using Avid for anamorphic work. The only time I shot anamorphic tests was on Premiere Pro (which I made the sequence the res of un squeezed anamorphic and squeeze the anamorphic back using scaling.) I know that there are plugins available for Premiere Pro that automatically does this.

videography,377g6o,devlinski,2,Mon May 25 19:51:43 2015 UTC,"Well... anamorphic lenses are heavier. They have half the depth of field for the same angle of view. They flare a lot, although that's part of their look. Backgrounds not only go out of focus but become skinny. There's more distortion at the sides of the frame than with a flat lens. Some anamorphic lenses don't focus unless you stop them down to f/4. Often sets have to be built wider as it's hard to get wider angles of view with barrel distortion and other effects.  Go see John Wick. The day interiors and exteriors were shot anamorphic, and all the night stuff was done spherical."

From there it literally just becomes a journey of all these different countries and maybe to a point you can juxtapose them quite nicely to see how every culture approaches happiness differently.

I'd also make sure to bring an audio interface unit to pipe directly into camera cause seriously you'll be data managing far too much and post will such huge.   As of now if I where to choose between a DSLR I would probably go with an A7S with a proper battery solution. Big part is how well it shoots 1080 and a nice LOG to shoot with. A big part of the issue with filming things of this nature is the lack of places to charge things so batteries is always an issue. I would most definitely bring a switronix power station with adapter and run it off of two of those and also have 6 spare A7S batteries themselves. Also I would make sure to buy the intervelometer app for the A7S as well.   Lens wise I would use all canon lens cause that is what I have invested in. I would have a metabones adapter and a fotodiox lens throttle. Lens throttle is amazing for day time but you do loose control of your aperture. Lens wise I would take the following -Rokinon 14mm -Canon 16-35 F4 -Canon 24-105 F4 -Canon 70-200 F4  I could probably lose the 70-200 in a pinch however. I would probably swap that out for a 35mm F1.4 but again up to the user.  Audio I would just get the Sony XLR-K2M and keep it simple. I would upgrade the shotgun mic to something awesome though like a nice senheiser or Sure. Smaller is better and bring a wind sock. A G3 Lav kit would be a good idea for interviews or just run it continusly on your main characters.   Camera supports. Here is where it gets difficult. Your always at the mercy of how much room you have in your bag. I would bring for sure a cage for the camera. That way you have something to rig to. Also a monopod with a tripod head on it is a good idea. A small set of sticks is a must. Carbon fiber is your friend and I personally use a cheap Benro carbon fiber unit for a backpacking trip through Colombia and it was not bad. Also if you have room for a very small slider track you can really bring up the production value of your Broll. I've brought a Duzi slider on a couple of things and that worked well.   Lights I'd bring at least a small on camera. Wescott makes the ice light but that thing is pricey and built in battery. I would probably give the iKan Piatto PL103 a chance on this one.   http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1105312-REG/ikan_pl103_accent_light_10.html  it looks as though it would work well to wrap around and give soft light. Don't forget batteries.   Also don't forget a shit ton of lens wipes and cleaner.   If I was to go GH4 I would probably change the lens to something like a Tokina 11-20mm F2.8, a brand of 17-55mm or 24-105mm F4. I would like to use the 18-35mm sigma but I just never find I use it unless it's on a second camera cause it's just not wide enough. I shoot wide a lot doing travel videography cause you always want to show the location. Also a 70-200mm F4 for far off Broll. I'd get an audio adapter like a juicelink or whatever brand you like and a cage to mount things too again. Also a Metabones speed booster is a must. Good thing is that you won't need and external batteries as the internal ones are great. I shoot a lot with knock of ones I got from Amazon and they are wonderful.  Also as a JIC battery solution to power my laptop or whatever from I would get a couple or more of the Ravpower extremes  http://www.amazon.ca/RAVPower%C2%AE-Multi-Voltage-UltraBook-Camcorder-Smartphone/dp/B00HFMUBYG/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1432595971&sr=8-6&keywords=Ravpower  That and an adapter and in a pinch you can charge your laptop or batteries with some custom wires.   Any ways hope that technical diarrhea gives you some help/ideas."

videography,375guy,EdwardHaul,2,Mon May 25 07:17:17 2015 UTC,"A ""speedbooster"" is a special kind of lens adapter.  Like normal adapters, it lets you mount a different kind of lens lens (in this case he's using a Nikon lens on a Micro-Four-Thirds camera), but it has the added feature of ""boosting"" or magnifying the amount of incoming light.  This is like adding an extra stop to your lens.  It's very useful for getting a brighter image without sacrificing as much image quality as you would by cranking up the ISO."

Get your hands on a tripod to get your shots steady.  Get close: Feets, muscles, focus in the eyes, springs in the trampoline and whatever detail that makes the scene. Pretty much all you have is wideshots.  I dont know what your editing in, but maybe try and have a look at Adobe Premiere. Watch some basic tutorials on getting started, export settings, and maybe a bit of colorgrading.  MUSIC! Do your editing to the music, and maybe try to find a track with a more constant rythm you can follow.  Look around on youtube or vimeo to find inspiration.  And then kill your darlings. 3.17 min is waaaay to long.   Just my 5 cents. Good luck with your project(s) :-)"

videography,374amu,Hunter_behindthelens,3,Sun May 24 19:15:54 2015 UTC,"I use a self-built PC, 4770k, 16GB RAM, and for portable work, I use a 15inch rMBP. Bought the rMBP used and saved over $600 off the price tag. It's a beast. 4870HQ is almost as quick as my PC.  As for NLE, I use Final Cut or Premiere. 90% is usually premiere.  Basically my workflow is: NX1(H.265) to RMMovieConverter (ProresHQ) then straight to Premiere Pro CC. I love that Premiere Pro on both my PC and Mac read Prores no issues.  Then I export in 4k for YouTube or downscale to 1080p for clients etc.  My video camera double purposes as a stock photo camera for my job, as they tend to handle inventory for small businesses.   My camera before was a T2i, then 70D (returned), then I rented a GH4, before finally deciding on a NX1.  My recommendation is go for a self-built PC, or buy a used self-built PC, if you want performance for a great price.  If you want portable computing, rMBP 15inch is hard to beat. It has good specs (4870HQ), a little lacking in GPU, but I get no lag, and it has 7 hours of battery life when your not using it for too much.   Honestly I love it.  If I had to pick one setup though, it would definitely be a self-built PC and a tablet or smartphone.  Hope this helps in some way!  PS: If you build your own PC, get a cheap 120GB SSD for the boot drive, and several 1TB or 2/3TB drives for media."
videography,374amu,EdwardHaul,1 point,Mon May 25 02:27:36 2015 UTC,"Let me ask you, how do you like switching between the two OS's? I am getting rid of my Alienware m18x just so I can use one single OS across every platform. Upgrading my m18x with an SSD was the greatest thing I've done with a computer.   Right now, I am leaning towards a custom built Hackintosh with dual built windows 8.1 (SSD + HDD each) to basically get the best of both worlds. Too performance Mac and awesome gaming computer in one."
videography,374amu,EdwardHaul,3,Mon May 25 03:53:34 2015 UTC,"Hackintosh is ok, but to get it installed is the biggest pain in the ass....it was even more difficult than building a watercooled pc with a custom loop.  See my hackintosh wouldn't go to a install screen, in fact it wouldn't install, I ended up having to add special boot flags. I think I had to specify the RAM, and even then the boot screen is kind of ghetto. I had to also use a VGA cable and a friends old school monitor just to get it to install, both my monitors are newer (1080p Samsung and 1440p X-Star Korean).  It crashes on boot, like you'll see the apple logo flash, then it will go to the login page.  Another issue with Hackintosh, is if your using a 2560x1440p monitor as your main, it will scale it to 1080p and stretch, then letterbox.  It looks awful. Oddly enough that doesn't happen if you use a 1440p monitor as your 2nd, and instead use a 1080p monitor as your main.  So to sum it up/tldr, Hackintosh is a pain in the arse to install, and to use it for production is a big no no for me.  Windows 8.1 is not bad, especially if you install ClassicShell. Then you get a Windows 7ish PC but faster and can handle about 10 days of uptime easily.  Personally I don't mind switching OS's, as both Premiere Pro CC versions (Windows and Mac) support Apple Prores.  The main benefit to Mac that I've noticed, is when I want to use Apple related apps (FCPX, Compressor, Mail etc) it's here and supported. Also having a rMBP comes in handy if you ever get a pro mac client that insists that you use FCPX, but that's only happened to me once.  All in all, if you want to dual built Hackintosh with Windows 8.1, go for it, that's what I did, and that's what I technically am still rocking on my PC, but be warned, Hackintosh is not recommended by pretty much anyone for production work. Also Hackintosh is not a perfect alternative to a Mac.  If you want to run everything in one OS, either go all Mac or go all Windows.   Personally I don't mind using both, as I don't have any issues, but I assume you could run into some depending on what your working in."
videography,374amu,bardomudo,10,Mon May 25 07:24:10 2015 UTC,"Nowadays that Final Cut is basically crap and Premiere has pretty much already become one of the industry standards, I really don't see the point in sticking with Apple when there are just as good alternatives to ProRes out there, such as the Avid codecs.  For the price of a Mac Pro you can get an almost twice as good PC that will certainly be much more 4k/futureproof than any Mac on the market.  Just my opinion."

Literally the only thing worth complaining about anymore is poor support for shared workflows. But those people are already on Avid anyway.   Everything else about the software is a strength, not a weakness."
videography,374amu,bardomudo,3,Mon May 25 01:49:31 2015 UTC,"Fully agree on Final Cut. I have used Premiere since high school, and am 100% adobe based in my workflow.   While I do agree PC is a lot better bang for the buck, every single other device I use is an Apple Product, and continuity is better. I use iCloud, and iLife projects daily. Handoff between devices is just something that I enjoy.   I am also looking into a compromise in building a Hackintosh."
videography,374amu,nav13eh,5,Sun May 24 20:26:50 2015 UTC,"I would advise against a hackintosh. I've tried it before and it's far too unreliable for any professional use. If you really need a Mac, then get a Mac.  In the end, as almost everything else, it's going to be about making sacrificies and deciding what your priorities are.  Is it worth to you paying more, having up to 50% less performance and becoming more limited just so you can keep using the Apple services you're used to?  Or would finding alternatives to these services be worth if it means you can have more power, be more futureproof and you could replace/upgrade parts for cheaper and far easier?  To me I would never sacrifice performance, but it's something you have to decide for yourself. Each person and need is different.   I have a desktop PC I built almost two years ago. It has an i7-3770k, 16GB RAM, GTX 670 and about 7TB of storage. It's a bit outdated for today's standards but it handles 1080p DSLR H.264 more or less perfectly (my basic worflow involves adding Unsharp Mask, Denoiser, MB Looks and MB Colorista, at this point it starts to struggle).   Things get a bit more complicated when I'm dealing with higher bitrate files, even with editing-friendly codecs such as Avid DNxHD. I'm about to start editing in the 5D's RAW and I imagine it will struggle even more.  I don't think I could realistically handle 4k for bigger projects right now. This is why performance is way too important for me and I'm not willing to sacrifice it."
videography,374amu,fadetowhite,1 point,Sun May 24 20:47:51 2015 UTC,"Spending twice the amount of money just so you can use Apple is not a wise decision now a days. All the Adobe stuff runs just as well on the same as level hardware on a PC. Also, the ability to easily upgrade parts in the system or have lots of room for hard drive expandability in the system is a huge plus.  I always try to convince people who want to go to Mac for editing, simply because the options for PC are far cheaper and more powerful. But hey, use your money how you want. Just don't be ignorant about it and do your research."
videography,374amu,hopopo,1 point,Mon May 25 02:19:33 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree with you! When it comes to every day editing, and strictly editing, PC is absolutely the way to go.   My draw towards apple products (and why I still choose to spend more) is just the way everything else works together. I am heavily invested into the apple environment where my Apple TV is pulling from my iTunes server, I can receive and respond to texts, emails, IMs, and Facebook messages seamlessly no matter if I am on my phone, iPad, or iMac. The ability to access my same documents through pages and iCloud is so much of a timesaver for productivity. From an overall standpoint the Mac environment fits my workflow, even tho it does come at some performance tradeoffs.   But if I just had one job with my computer, and did strictly editing everyday, you bet your ass I'd have a good pc tuned for the shortest render times I could manage."
videography,374amu,wil541,5,Mon May 25 03:49:09 2015 UTC,"""Basically crap"" is not how I would describe FCPX. I find it funny that people say that the industry has shifted to certain software or equipment. The industry is huge and it depends on genre, length, country and even city.   FCPX is a very capable editor. The first version launched without certain features, but nearly all of those have been subsequently added. It has been updated numerous times and many films and shows are edited on it.   I use both FCPX and Premiere and using FCPX is a breath of fresh air. I find the interface is much nicer and it is so much easier to edit. It is also faster in every way, especially with playback and rendering.   It's all down to personal preference of course, but let's not get hyperbolic about it - both pieces of software are excellent editing platforms."

Only things I didn't have to purchase was power supply and one 240gb ssd drive   When all that was set and done I ended up with the machine that had as much processing power as anything that Apple is offering at the fraction of the price. Also I can swap the parts anyway I want at anytime I want and on top of that I have 6tb of internal storage ( 3tb raid one plus additional 3tb of storage)   For the record I had no prior experience in building computers and with little help from youtube and some patience you can save a ton of money and use it for upgrading your gear."

Main reason being Final Cut 7 is the last good version, and it is many years old now. Premier CC is updated constantly, and it runs (adobe says) 10% faster on a PC vs a Mac.  Similarly desktop vs laptop, you get way more power out of a laptop than a desktop. They are also way easier to upgrade later (saving you money).  2 big things for video editing. Processor and Graphics card. Most computers have plenty of RAM now 4+gb, yea more is great, but not as critical as the other pieces. As far as what specific processors to get I am not entirely sure.

videography,374amu,Contrapaul,1 point,Sun May 24 23:57:44 2015 UTC,"Just a personal anecdote, but early last year I switched from a 8-core Xenon MacPro (2009 I think?) to the trashcan 6-core MacPro and saw marginal performance improvements in most software - with the exception of FCPX (way faster render times).   It could be because I'm running Adobe Production Premium 6.0 and not CC, but Premiere and After Effects run basically the same as they did on the old computer. Final Cut uses the MacPro's dual GPUs, but Adobe 6.0 doesn't.   Your biggest problem with the old tower is not going to be performance, but future lack of support from Apple. I'd give it ~3 more years before Apple stops supporting the 2011 MacPro with OSX updates, which could hurt you with everything else since they might require the newest version of OSX.   But price wise, the new MacPro is steep for what you get. I only have one because I didn't have to pay for it."

videography,374amu,altimax98,1 point,Mon May 25 03:42:11 2015 UTC,I think it was an ATI GPU but it was nothing special. It was the card that originally came with the tower. Had only a half a GB of VRAM.  Upgrading the GPU to an Nvidia CUDA card would probably be a good idea if you go with the old Mac Pro. I would double check compatability first though. I don't think you can just drop any PC GPU into a Mac tower.

A good budget lav is the Giant Squid lav. Budget camera mounted shotgun mic? Go for the Rode VideoMic Pro. XLR shotgun mics with boom mounts tend to cost a bit more.  Both of these mics will be able to be put directly into a cameras 3.5mm input, but the lav isn't designed for this, it's better to get an external recorder and sync it in post.  Basically it all comes down to your needs and budget. But I'd strongly recommend an interchangeable lens DSLR, as you will quickly outgrow a bridge camera."

videography,374yeb,NeedsVideoHelp,4,Sun May 24 22:35:21 2015 UTC,"Hey. I've live-streamed a few sport events (albeit with motion in them) with some very minimal equipment and I can definitely give you feedback. First of all, if you're using a laptop there is no easy way to ""upgrade"" the video card, so you'd probably need to buy a better laptop with better built-in graphics capabilities. Also, who is your target audience? If you're mainly trying to show to people who have phones, 720p could be fine- although I recently streamed in 480p and wished for a bit more aswell. For one of the events I streamed, I used a friend's iphone with a unlimited 4G connection to stream off of(only problem was phone battery life, although that shouldn't be an issue if you're using a laptop). If it's a stationary platform, then you probably can get away fine with a webcam, but using a dedicated camera with webcam capabilites will work fine. If you do want to take the video quality to the next level, consider investing in a new camcorder that has a clear 1080p output over hdmi (hard to find these days)  and plug it into something like a Blackmagic Intensity.   I have livestreamed to youtube and can tell you that using free software like OBS to change the stream quality settings and mix video inputs can help to improve stream quality. If there's anything I didn't cover please ask."

The way the brain works is that it picks up all these details without us noticing. In the end it is rather the sum of these details that makes the memory complete.

(The crop factor affects both Effective Focal Length and Effective Aperture Value).  They are probably using a 35mm f/1.8 on a full frame (not just any camera) meaning that the DOF is shallower and the field of view is wider. ND filter is a must in this situation too (exposure time should be determined by your frame-rate).

videography,372st2,celloyouvegotabass,1 point,Sun May 24 12:13:14 2015 UTC,"In short, yes.  I think the main division you will see is belts versus vests for ""wearable"" equipment carrying.  Each have their own merits.  Vests have a lot more space to spread stuff around on, which really helps avoid having things so clustered together they cannot be accessed.  However the drawback is that often they take longer to don or doff, which may or may not be an issue for you.  In many cases vests are better if you spend a lot of time in vehicles.  Belts are usually a bit more low profile and faster to don and doff, but have limited space and get cramped real fast.  Weight concentration can be a problem depending on the relative weights of what you are attaching.  Some belts have built in options for suspenders for very heavy loads.  The main divide in belts will be if they are just a plain band to which to attach pouches or cases with belt loops, or if the belt comes with something like MOLLE or PALS webbing which tends to offer a different family of compatible pouches and containers.  There's versions of both ranging from $10 airsoft stuff, up to $1000 tailor made indestructable masterpieces.  For both vests and belts, there's an almost endless variety such as padded versus non-padded, or relative stiffness, and all importantly weight.  Some stuff weighs several pounds before you even attach anything.  If I had to buy a new vest or belt, I would probably end up with a BFG Beltminus and a couple Helium Whisper pouches. Yes, it's not dedicated for the audio/video industry, but it's hard to beat that kind of quality or functionality.  A whole lot of the pouches and other attachments fit other stuff.  I know guys who carry around granola bars in pouches intended for pistol magazines, and pudding cups in grenade pouches.  Tactical pudding.  The main benefit of something like this is that you can choose exactly what you want to carry and wear.  Stuff with pre-located pockets are a bit trickier to customize because you can't move stuff around.  With mounting options like this stuff, if one spot doesn't work you can reloate things and you don't end up with unnecessary pockets and pouches unless you specifically want them there."
videography,373eea,CwrwCymru,3,Sun May 24 14:34:23 2015 UTC,"I use them for video all the time.  They don't magically reduce highlights. They work on reflections, and only at certain angles. If you're at a 45 degree angle to windows, for example, you can eliminate a lot of reflections. Dead on it's not going to work so well.  If someone is strongly backlit by the sun and a highlight on their skin is blowing out, that's often due to a specular highlight caused by the sun reflecting off the oil in their skin. A polarizer will generally eliminate that, reducing the exposure in that highlight considerably.  Polarizers will remove the blue cast caused by blue sky reflecting in shiny grass, making the grass appear a vibrant green instead of a dull blueish green. It'll also makes the sky a deep blue at 90 degrees to the sun.  Get a circular polarizer. Note that this does not indicate the shape of the filter, but more it's function. Circular polarizers work better with cameras that use prisms for splitting out colors (3 CCD) or auto focus/exposure."
videography,373eea,ArtAdamsDP,1 point,Sun May 24 17:04:17 2015 UTC,"Polarizing filter (photography):       A polarizing filter or polarising filter is often placed in front of the camera lens in photography in order to darken skies, manage reflections, or suppress glare from the surface of lakes or sea. Since reflections (and sky-light) tend to be at least partially linearly-polarized, a linear polarizer can be used to change the balance of the light in the photograph. The rotational orientation of the filter is adjusted for the preferred artistic effect. For modern cameras, a circular polarizer is typically used, this comprises firstly a linear polarizer which performs the artistic function just described, followed by a quarter-wave plate which further filters the now-linearly polarized light into circularly-polarised light before entering the camera. This additional step avoids problems with auto-focus and light-metering sensors within some cameras, which otherwise may not function reliably with a simple linear polariser.

Mostly I use it to knock down reflections in glass or windows, then it's really useful.  They are more essential for photography because they are highly angle dependent.  If you have a locked down shot you can use a polarizer for video just as you would for stills, but with a moving camera a polarizer can have a negative effect because reflections and highlights might change so when you cut to a different angle it could look different."
videography,373eea,ScreamingPenguin,0,Sun May 24 18:02:53 2015 UTC,You cannot use them for video if you have different views. Polarising effect depends on angle to the sun and so depends on time too. You can get totally different colors from different directions and different time of day.

One, I do ENG stuff and I am always breaking down and setting up again. That wouldn't be a problem for someone who is stationary for long periods of time, or if it had a quick release snap button on each leg. And two, both my Cullman ct100 and Manfrotto sticks have long center columns, making mounting this impossible.  HOWEVER: I do love the creativity of the piece, and you definitely should Kickstart it, even if I couldn't use it myself. But what I personally could use most would probably be just the headphone rest. Make it size adjustable for larger legs and I'd have one of those on every damn tripod I have!

Those two have large, fixed center columns that you could probably attach the pouch to, but I don't know how you'd get a secure fit too easily. The center hanging with the water bottle would be right out. I also have a handful of other Manfrotto sets, all discontinued, that look similar to these with 502DV heads.  I use all of those to fly a fleet of Sony NX5u's for almost everything I do. At full capacity they are kitted out with NP-970 batteries, crappy 7"" monitors with external power, Sennheiser ME66/K6 shotguns and G2 wireless lav kits, and the occasional on-camera tungsten light from the stone age powered by a beltpack battery. Nothing in my kit is younger than 5 years, but it's stood the test of time. My only changes in the future are going to be to replace the NX5u's with something newer, maybe that DVX200, or more likely the Z100, and to upgrade the T4i I've been playing with to a C100, because I absolutely freaking despise DSLR's for run-and-gun or ENG and event video work. I might also pick up a new LCD when quality 5"" displays powered easily get even cheaper with smartphone screens becoming more ubiquitous.   The ideal pouch would hold SD cards and an extra battery or two for the NXcams, at least four to eight AA's for the wireless mics, a microfiber cloth for when crap gets splashed on the lens, and pouch for business cards and kit contact info. I also love the headphone peg idea, so make sure to keep those, but maybe have a ring and a carabiner attached to the orange rings for the keys/multitool instead. Using velcro to make the kit modular is the kind of thing /r/EDC and Kickstarter would go crazy over, but that's the effect the word modular has had on the industry lately anyways :P  All the best!

videography,372k63,dialgatrack,6,Sun May 24 07:06:09 2015 UTC,"Cameras in general, even high end models, don't perform well in video autofocus. Typically they will miss focus or spend time hunting focus, manual focusing is the normal way of focusing and no one in the professional industry will use auto focusing for video (high end video cameras don't even have it as a feature). In the professional industry now you have wireless focusing systems you'll usually have someone pulling focus seperate to the person controlling the camera; a two person job. If you want to get a shot on a stabilizer by yourself without the luxury of a crew and tens of thousands of dollars in equipment then you just minimize the potential for an out of focus shot i.e. focus to infinity, set a low aperture, practice tracking shot with the subject, these is something you can practice at in your own time for free. The D750 would be no better at autofocus nor would any other camera. Canon make a couple of cameras like the 70D which have a different focusing system that gives acceptable video autofocus and have been popular with use on stabilizers; however if you ever wanted to move up to anything better camera wise you would hurt yourself in the long run not being able to nail manual focus, so stick with your D5200 and think about ways you can improve your shots in the constraints of your setup and environment! Good luck!"
videography,372k63,ashyxx,3,Sun May 24 07:47:07 2015 UTC,"Hi /u/dialgatrack - congrats on your graduation!  If you want autofocus, you can get a fast autofocusing hybrid still/video camera with a large sensor and interchangeable lenses - but it probably won't be a DSLR.  Mirrorless camera such as the Samsung NX1, the 5-axis stabilized Oly OM-D EM5 Mk II, the Panasonic G and GH series cameras and Sony mirrorless cameras all have fast autofocus with silent lenses.  And, of course, most camcorders and point & shoot cameras have fast, accurate autofocus - but they generally have small sensors and are not very good for still photography.  This was part of the reason I sold my DSLR and went mirrorless. I have the 4K Panasonic GH4 DSLM (4 times the video resolution of your D5200), which has great face tracking autofocus, but the 4K Samsung NX1 is even better, as seen here.  This camera also does a great job of tracking objects other than human faces, as seen here and here.  Especially noteworthy is that this camera maintains a solid autofocus track while shooting 120fps slow motion.  In addition to its high frame rate slow motion and 4K resolution, this camera also has a headphone jack and a built-in electronic viewfinder, so you aren't reliant on the LCD for critical focus and composition outdoors (where DSLR LCDs can be washed out by bright sunlight - unless you buy a hood or LCD viewfinder).  Here is the video image quality you can get from this camera:  Dialogue/Narrative   Samsung NX1 test scene. 2 person dialogue at night by a fire. [The Quiet Escape] - a Short Film. 2015.   Travel   Exploring Iceland Lisbon's Light Christmas at Hanbury Hall with the Samsung NX1 - Low(ish) Light - High ISO   Documentary   Project-Definition | Above the Rest    120 fps 1080p Slow Motion   Samsung NX1 120fps   Skate   Samsung NX1 | Christmas Skate Tasnádi Béla // Tasi G // 2 days / 2015 Winter (rollerblading) Renton Millar skating St Kilda Prahran Melbourne HD NX1 Samsung (only a few seconds of slo mo in this one, but a nice edit)   It's a great still camera too, with a 15fps continuous frame rate (a lot faster than the D750's 6.5fps).  Here's the still image quality you can get from this 28.2MP camera: Flickr Samsung NX1 Pool  The best price I can find for this camera with the 16-50mm power zoom lens and a Samsung USA warranty is $1698.95, as of this post.  If you want to keep your Nikon glass to do some old-fashioned manual focus, you can do so with a $20 adapter.  The only downside to the NX1, in my view, is the 30 minute continuous recording limit (the same as your D5200).  Only camcorders and Panasonic G and GH cameras can record for longer.  All this means is, if you have an event that goes over half an hour, you will have to hit the record button to restart the camera every 30 minutes.  This may or may not be a big deal to you.  It also has a new and more efficient type of video compression, h.265, which Power Director 13 Ultra editing software will read, but if you don't have PD13, you can use the free RockyMountains Movie Converter to transcode your footage to ProRes or h.264 in order to edit it (until the other software manufacturers catch up).  Hope this is helpful and good luck!"

I own a Samsung NX1 with a samsung 45mm f1.8 lens and its freaking fast as hell auto focusing during video mode. I can understand the 30 minute time limit being a issue for you. For me though I don't need more than 30 min and the Samsung has other upsides I liked too, so I chose that over the GH4.  However, OP one thing is certain. Both the GH4 and NX1 destroy DSLRs for video. I always think my Canon 60D is out of focus during video when comparing the cameras. Nope, the mirror less videos are just that much more detailed.

This camera also records at 4 times the video resolution of your D5200.

If you have made any decent videos using the GH4's autofocus in video then please post them because it was one of the biggest complaints about the camera at launch. It's not usable. The G7 will be no better since it uses the same tech. The NX1 and 70D are the only passable cameras for video auto focus but would still rather own something like a GH4 for all the aftermarket accessories, better video quality and not having to transcode (which you pointed out at least), it is not a camera for good video autofocus though!"

Like the AX100, this camera has a relatively large 1"" sensor - but unlike the AX100, it also has pro XLR mic inputs, a 10-bit 4:2:2 broadcast quality codec and SDI out.  The X70's large sensor makes it possible to create shallow depth of field, as seen in this example.  In addition, its optical steady shot system makes for very stable handheld shots.  Walking shots in this travel piece are an example of what the X70 can do: San Blas Islands of Panama. December 2014.  Here it is intercut with the Panasonic GH4 in an indoor single musician live performance: Chris August sings The Maker  It's also a good exterior B roll camera, as seen here: NYC Stock Footage using the PXW-X70  In my view, the X70's optical steady shot system, built-in pro XLR inputs and modern and robust broadcast-ready 10-bit codec make it a great choice for your jiu jitsu matches  -  while its large sensor makes it a better choice for shallow depth-of-field interviews (as seen here) than most camcorders in its class.

My next camera will have XLR inputs.   I've read that there were some codec issues with the Sony. Any experience with that?   When you shoot in AVCHD, you won't have any issues.

I can't afford something like a Shogun on top of this camera. I guess equally important would be, is the 4k tech in this camera still too new to invest in? I know waiting on tech is a never ending battle as something better is always in the works.  If most of my stuff will end up on youtube/vimeo will the 4k capability really matter?

It's about the same price, you lose the center column & it weighs more, but you can go higher, it'll be more stable & the 75mm bowl opens you up to many video heads.  Center column is nice, but I've only seen it well done for video on the Sachtler Hot Pod.  Video tripods should be all about stability & leveling the head & not weighing a ton.  535 does all of those things.  As for what head to get, I love love love Vinten for any event type shoots.  Pan & tilt is beautifully smooth.  Prefect balance is the best thing that has ever happened to tripod heads & can't be over sold enough.  Second to Vinten, Sachtler FSB 6 or FSB 8, if you need a bigger range of weight for counter balance.  Amazing heads, but pan, tilt & balance has steps which you have to adjust between takes, unlike infinitely adjustable settings on Vinten.  Lots of people use Manfrotto heads.  Don't.  They're good if you have no money & don't know what it's like to use an amazing head.    Get a Vinten or Sachtler & it will put last your next three cameras.

I went with this tripod because I needed something strong enough to hold the above mentioned combination, but compact and light enough to carry on the side of a backpack.  I will certainly look at the Vinten and Sachtler options (I've used Vinten but not Sachtler before).  I got the idea of using this tripod from this blog: http://alaskavideoshooter.com/complete-documentary-filmmaking-kit-in-one-backpack/  I've spent most of my budget on the legs, so either I get a cheaper video head + leveling base (I notice the arcatech one is difficult to find in the UK. I managed to find a few on amazon but don't know whether they are decent enough http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00VE0KKR8?colid=2KRLAXJD9VBKJ&coliid=I1U76G9CCZCZ5D&ref_=wl_it_dp_o_pC_S_ttl), or I send these legs back and reconsider the whole thing."
videography,36z6rh,zijital,2,Sun May 24 10:32:33 2015 UTC,"If you're locked into that Tripod, Vinten is out.  You can't remove the pin from the head of their current models & the really old ones where you could are going to be too heavy for what you want to do.  Check out th Manfrotto 438 to level a flat base head, about $85 USD.  http://www.manfrotto.com/ball-camera-leveller  Now for the head, if you have some cash, Sachtler.  All the current 75mm bowl models have a flat base after you take out the pin.  The FSB series is really solid, but you could see some money on a Ace, which are aupposed to be good for the price, but I have yet to give one a whirl.  Advantage if you get an Ace is you'll have some legs that will probably be more sturdy than the Gitzo.  If that is too expensive, then Manfrotto for now & save for something better later.  I used a 503 for years & thought it was smoker than a 503HDV, but the HDV version has adjustable counter balance.  I've seen a ton of 504HD heads, which just pains me.  $5k camera, a bunch of $1k lenses, and a $400 head that gives sub par pans & tilts.  I demo a 504HD briefly at NAB years ago & it just doesn't stack up to a Vinten or Sachter.  Mics, tripods, lenses & lights can last for decades if you get a good model, or you can replace them every couple years when a new camera comes out if you get something that won't last."

This can be useful for later removing some aspects of this noise in post.  -Many cameras allow for directional audio. For instance some Sony cameras with the ""5.1 Surround Sound"" audio are capable of changijg between a sort of shotgun mic mode and omnidirectional mic mode. You may decide to keep one vs the other depending on what you hear and want to accomplish.  -Do something entirely outside the camera to fix the offending noise. Maybe like telling a loud patron to quiet down, or turning off a fan which was adding background ambience, however slight it may be.  Having headphones can be an immensely useful tool depending on what you need to accomplish. Saved my ass a few times in past shoots to be sure. Especially with events stuff."

The most glaring instance that comes to mind is when a wireless mic was being used, and while there ware no issues that would necessarily appear on the meters, interference on the frequency being used caused 'pops' that no plug-in is going to be able to fix.  This on interviews that could not be re-shot.  A simple frequency change on the wireless package would have solved this, but it wasn't even noticed because the videographer wasn't wearing headphones.  Look at it this way - on a shoot where double-system sound and a dedicated recordist are being used, do you think you see the recordist relying on his meters alone to ensure good audio?  If you're a one-person-show, you can save yourself a LOT of headaches by wearing earbuds at least."

Though mixed well. Plenty of headroom to bring up the volume as a whole. Most people won't be listening to this on studio monitors and are probably cranking their volume just to hear this video.  Second the narrators voice is a little to booming and tough to understand. I get the whole bringing out the bass in his voice thing but maybe counter with bumping the high end a little for more clarity.  Honestly great job though.

It has that noticeable roundness to the horizon and I spotted it from a mile away. GoPro's free software comes with sliders to fix that or you can do it in after effects quite easily. Great work though! Really enjoyed everything else.

Okay, that and the image will fall apart in heavy grading without recording externally. But overall, it really is a fantastic camera. Especially for what it's selling for now.  Bottom line, don't sweat the slow motion. You have a highly capable camera on your hands."

videography,36wbby,ufaild,2,Sat May 30 21:56:52 2015 UTC,"Never fear! You've chosen a great camera that puts out some amazing images and is one of the most practical units on the market.  You can get fairly good slow motion from it, but you trade off some sharpness. You know how a 5D mk III can do 720 50/60p? Well it'll look a bit like that.  Record in 1080 50/60i with a 1/100 shutter, then import your footage into Premiere Pro. Make a new sequence that is 1080 24 or 25p. When you drag it in, choose to keep sequence settings. Then right click the clip and change speed to 50%. Premiere has a feature where it automatically frame blends interlaced footage. You won't get those horizontal lines, but as I mentioned it won't be quite as sharp.   I'd seriously recommend a Ninja Blade or the new blackmagic video assist to give you ProRes HQ, as the better color depth and higher bit rate will help counteract the loss in sharpness.  Hope this helps. If you have any questions feel free to PM me. I've been shooting with this camera for over a year and have learned a lot of tricks and workarounds."

videography,36wbby,doodlefarts79,0,Sat May 23 10:11:16 2015 UTC,"why not just  buy a bmpc then, it's the SAME price as the c100 but offers 4x the resolution,  10x the bitrate, canon lenses plus a ssd built in AND Raw video."
videography,36wbby,klaqua,1 point,Sun May 24 18:03:38 2015 UTC,"You should do a side by side comparison if you get a chance.   They both have 4k sensors. Having a high bit rate doesn't guarantee you a good image. The original BMPC has a cropped sensor, which is a pain in the arse with canon glass.  The RAW video from that camera is terribly bloated and impractical for a majority of work flows.    These points aside, the blackmagic has so many problems as a camera it's almost laughable. It's a toy designed for studios, it's not a workhorse production camera like the Canon range.  It has a useless battery life that forces you to use external batteries, costing you extra and weighing down your rig. It CHEWS power like a goddamn poltergeist, I went through two 130 V-locks in one afternoon. Meanwhile the C100 might use one Canon battery a day. Maybe one and half if you're filming constantly.   It's got horrendous ergonomics which means you can't shoot right out of the box. C100 you can and has an awesome top handle and side grip. The Mk II has got a decent enough eyepiece which means you can have your 3 points of contact.    The Blackmagic cameras have no useable audio. Using an external recorder is a pain in the arse for any job where you can't pay for a sound recordist. The C100 has great audio: XLR inputs, mixing, monitoring.   No built in ND filters. Come on.  The C100 has much better low light performance and much better looking grain. The Blackmagic has barely any kick in its ISO at all.   As far as I know, it also lacks a huge number of the proper tools for cinematography. Accurate WFM, expanded focus, peaking, zebra, false color. These may have been added by an update now, but when I used one it didn't have any of these.  It has a large number of bugs like the black sun and audio corrupting, and despite recording ProRes on it you still get aliasing and moire on fine patterns. The skin tones out of the Canon cameras are way more natural and attractive than the Blackmagic cameras.   The internal limitations of the C100 can be cheaply worked around, but they aren't a game breaker for shooting in the field. The internal recording is actually fairly good, especially on the Mk II. The shortcomings of the Blackmagic cost more to work around as they're more fundamental to the cameras design.  TL;DR The C100 is much better in the field than the Blackmagic cameras in almost every way, resolution and file sizes aren't everything."

Panasonic G and GH cameras, for example, have a better downscaling algorithm. Here are a couple of side-by-sides between the Canon 60D and a moire-resistant Panasonic GH camera:   60D vs GH2 Moire Test Canon 60D vs Panasonic GH2 evil moiré test   Newer Canon cameras are not much better.  Here is a side-by-side between the Canon 60D and 70D:   Canon 70D and 60D moire comparison   Instead of a Canon DSLR, you might want to seriously consider the $515 (with 14-42mm kit lens) Panasonic G6 and an inexpensive Nikon to micro 4/3 adapter for your Nikkors (here is the one I use - it works great with the lenses from my old Nikon D50).  The Panasonic G6 has 1080/60p recording for in-camera slow motion, the ability to record for hours continuously, an electronic viewfinder you can actually use for shooting video outdoors in bright sunlight (when a DSLR's LCD is likely to be washed out) and compatibility with affordable Panasonic power zoom lenses.

Do you hand out different business cards depending on the potential client?  If not, I'd highly recommend it, and the same goes for a website.  Visitors who come to your site decide in mere moments whether you can offer them the solution they're looking for.  If the types of services you offer are all over the place and unrelated, then they will move on to the next.  As such, building separate sites for each type of production is important so that you can immediately communicate how you can help a potential client from the moment they land on your site."

For this project I shot with the slider on a tripod, as well as on it's legs.  I forgot to bring a second pan/ball head, so was limited to adjusting the whole slider.  Whoops!  Lessons Learned:   It's hard to make smooth slides without a counterweight or spinning weight. It helps a LOT to have a video head atop the slider allowing you to follow your subject. There is such a thing as too slow, or too long of a slide.  (eg. slide from 0:39-1:10 is tooooo long.  Was stuck with it for continuity) I'm still a bit confused on cutting between left and right slides.  It's nice to balance slides with static shots and other cam moves.

I can't speak from experience for other stations, but my company is very particular as to who they train for SNG, mainly because of the responsibility of operating a 250,000 piece of equipment. The training (on the job, shadowing) was about a month.   As far as schooling, there is none for that specific occupation. It's more of a vetted through experience as a camerman situation.  It also helps if you are highly proficient in both shooting and editing (depending on the station's needs), as well as field producing, since candidates typically have much more experience than the other photogs on staff, and tend to lead others at a remote location.  Granted, it could be an easier process in smaller markets.  Also worth noting, with the advent of Dejero's, Live-vu, and other IP devices, this position is shrinking. I tend not to worry though, since there will always be a need for production trucks in some capacity, and I have what most of us call the ""triple-threat"" (shoot, edit, trucks)."

I started working in News back in 2004, previously, I had interned with that station so I had my foot in the door. They had had a chance to see that I could shoot, compose a shot, get the iris set right, follow the action, etc. And they knew I could edit a story as well, I worked with the weekend editor putting together VO's and VOSOTs for about 5 months at that point.   When I was hired on (this was a mid to low market station) they immediately set out training me out how to shoot for news, how to tell the story, what questions to ask in interviews. The seasoned shooters shared their advice and I absorbed as much as I could. The same went for the live trucks, I hadn't worked with one before, but they grilled me over and over those first few weeks. Any live shot that was happening, I was shadowing it.   Live Trucks (and SAT trucks) are intimidating as hell at first, but honestly, they're pretty easy to use and there will be someone training you on it.   Slightly related word of advice: If you love working in news then keep at it, go for awards and really do your best to kick ass at it. If, after about a year, you find yourself dreading going to work, get out. It's a rough job, physically and emotionally.   Good luck, and look up and live!"

But, it's when something goes wrong, knowing how to solve it in less than 30 seconds, that's when you either flourish or get set back down to strictly photog. So, for anyone who thinks the job is easy... it's probably because your working with a good truck op who makes it look that way. ;)"

videography,36qt1g,learnaboutfilm,7,Thu May 21 11:40:15 2015 UTC,"I use the C100.  It's easier to work with than an SLR, but you have to know what you're doing.  It has zebras, WFM, all the shit you need.  I LOVE the C100 and I don't care what anyone says about it.  It's one of the best overall cameras to go shoot with.  I can run and gun, do some great cinematic shit with it, use it for webinars, weddings... Like a DSLR though, once you start tossing shit on it, the camera can get HUGE and heavy fast.  My favourite feature on the C100 is C-Log.  I am able to shoot complete unaltered RAW footage onto my ninja 2.  You have to go into the menu and hit CPLOCK or something to enable it.  This gives you a grey picture.  After you're done filming you have to grade it or add a LUT to it.  Audio control is spectacular too.  The only thing I find with audio on the C100 is that it peaks real easy.  I find my audio is always kind of ""compressed"".  Play with the camera and you'll love it.  Watch some videos on wave form monitors on the C100.  Use WFM, use peak focus, use zebras, do not use auto iris, the auto focus is good, but get used to focusing manually, always switch your lens off of AF if you manual focus, check your audio levels make sure your target is not peaking.  Do not be afraid to ask someone to start from the top.  Give yourself plenty of headroom and start time on your footage."
videography,36qt1g,Biffmcgee,3,Thu May 21 14:25:15 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty serious camera for teens to use. If they've got experience with other cameras before then maybe, but if this is their first real project I'd go with something simpler. If you want good low light performance I'd go for the Sony A7s which is basically made of magic fairy dust for crazy awesome ISOs. If you're exporting as 1080p maybe try filming 4k with a GH4 and then downscaling in post for pretty similar image quality? I'd love to play with a C100 as a teen, but if you asked me 6 months ago before I started playing around with a T2i I wouldn't have known the first thing to do with it."
videography,36qt1g,chromeboy42,1 point,Thu May 21 11:49:34 2015 UTC,Is an A7S really easier for video than a C100? From what I've read it takes experience to get good results with it. BTW they will be spending two days learning and making practice films before they get down to serious shooting.
videography,36qt1g,Rajminster,3,Thu May 21 13:35:57 2015 UTC,"If you plan on using S-Log on the A7s, I've heard it's very tricky to do proper exposure for it. The A7s also has tons of pages of menus. The C100 has a bunch of buttons on the outside for easy access and the menus are better laid out.  The A7s will kick ass in low light, but the C100 seems better for your purpose. The GH4's low light is as good as your 60D (so not that great, I have a 60D too)."
videography,36qt1g,cairmen,1 point,Thu May 21 14:58:40 2015 UTC,"Have an a7s, not a massively expert cinematographer (I'm in the process of converting from animation). ""Very tricky"" is a bit of an overstatement, but yeah, the exposure for s-log isn't a barrel of laughs to get right, and for people who don't have a lot of prior experience, might be a bugbear.   One of the issues is that if you're shooting s-log, you really need to take the footage right through the grade a bunch of times to get the hang of what's going on. I've been using the a7s for months now and I'd say I could still know more about how to get the most from its log format.   Also, if you're planning to shoot in daylight with a a7s and you want to shoot log, you'll need an ND filter."
videography,36qt1g,chromeboy42,1 point,Fri May 22 10:19:02 2015 UTC,"Two days might be enough time for the C100, but its just as complicated if not more than the A7s so it really just comes down to how extreme lighting you'll have. Really up to you and them tho, ask them what they'd like to work with and show them some videos from both."
videography,36qt1g,smushkan,3,Thu May 21 13:47:39 2015 UTC,"The C series is a lot eaisier to work with than the average DSLR. Make sure the manual is to hand in case you need help finding a certain setting in the menus and you'll be fine.  Don't use full auto, especially if this project is for education and experience - It may sabotage the results, and it isn't good practice."
videography,36qt1g,AnneBancroftsGhost,1 point,Thu May 21 11:52:00 2015 UTC,"Agree on the full auto for most of the shots. I'm going to be teaching them about exposure, WB and manual focus.

videography,36qt1g,AnneBancroftsGhost,1 point,Thu May 21 13:38:01 2015 UTC,"Even in situations like a long tracking shot, using auto mode is still not the proper way to go about it.   You would use lights and nd rolls to get an even (enough) lighting on the length of the shot (this is a situation where a light meter is a useful tool).  I realize this is just a class for teenagers and you may not have the time and resources to do all that. But I recommend you point out that while you're using auto iso out of necessity, it is not something you would normally ever see on a professional set."

videography,36sqwm,inroth,3,Thu May 21 20:40:35 2015 UTC,"Ok, here we go. I'm gonna nitpick this for your own good but no offense meant as it's your first. This felt like ""B-Roll: The Music Video"". So many angles, yet still very boring to me. Also, the singer was captured oddly. It was like the theme of the shoot was ""How can we hide the fact that she's fat? Ok, let's shoot her in the dark, and only from the chest up. Everyone else gets a body shot but her."" Also, the handheld felt like it was an amateur failing at keeping the shot steady, not a pro purposefully doing shaky cam. It was weird when it went to the split screen with the black dividers. You either should have used that throughout the video or not at all. At 1:42, there's a giant ass scream in the song, but no video acknowledgement of it. It's weird. Happens a few times. There's a weird cut at about 2:11 from the drummer TO the drummer and he's doing two completely different things. Doesn't work for me. From an artistic perspective, I liked a lot of the shots. They just needed some more flagship A-roll type shots to compliment them. My favorites where the moving drum shots, the up and side shot of the guitar in the shadows and anytime you could see more than one person playing an instrument. Like, one in the foreground, another in the background and out of focus. And herein lies my biggest concern, the fact it almost felt like these guys weren't even in the same room at the same time. We don't get one shot with the entire band in it? What's up with that? Maybe it's just me, but I don't get how you can make a band vid without the band in it as a band."
videography,36qtzv,Cerberus73,2,Thu May 21 11:50:46 2015 UTC,"Live-mixing HD video is not typically something that can be generally be done for cheap, with that in mind:   Two XA10 camcorders - $3000 Tripods to match - $160 A couple of 10' Mini-HDMI to HDMI cables - $30 VMix Thunder 4*HDMI capture box with live mixing software and NLE - $3000 ASUS G760GX laptop - $1500 I'd recommend a $250 allowance for cables and accessories that you may find you need   Total - Around $8000. Shop around for better prices.  The above system will allow you to mix two cameras live (with the option to expand to 4 cameras later on) that you can then output to both a screen on site, and also stream online using a number of services. It will also record the cameras so you can edit the footage later on.  A limitation is that HDMI is not made for live camera work, so you'll be quite limited in how far the cameras can be from the base station. There isn't much that can be done for this save for swapping for an HD-SDI system which would run into the tens of thousands.  You could save costs by using cheaper consumer-oriented camcorders with HDMI out. DSLRs or mirrorless cameras could be used as well, however you do run the risk of them shutting off from getting too hot.  You could also save further costs by building a desktop computer up to Vmix's specifications and purchasing a 2 port HDMI PCI-e capture card instead of the Thunder/Gaming laptop combination.  I'd also recommend you get in touch with some local hire places, especially if this is an event that won't be repeated often. You'll be able to hire much better gear than you'll be able to afford.  If you're stunned silent by the price, there are alternatives - you could look into 'VJ'-orientated video mixing software and instead use USB HD webcams as your cameras. This won't give a very professional result, but it will work."
videography,36qtzv,smushkan,1 point,Thu May 21 16:57:38 2015 UTC,"Woah....  I had envisioned having two HD camcorders with onboard storage (SD card, I guess?).  They'd record their raw video on their internal storage while outputting HDMI(?) at the same time.  Then I was imagining a simple HDMI switch or something that we could just pop back and forth to control what's on the screen.  I don't need to do live recording where the recorded stream has to match what the monitor sees a la broadcasting setup.  I was hoping I could just take the two raw videos and mix them down in VSDC or something after the fact.  Am I out to lunch here?  Thanks!"
videography,36qtzv,smushkan,2,Thu May 21 17:38:22 2015 UTC,"Not really! I think I overestimated what you were trying to achieve :-)  There are HDMI switches that will do what you need - they're obviously gonna be more basic than a video mixer, so yes you could do it that way too.  You'll still be limited by the maximum length of HDMI cables, so you may need some HDMI repeaters in order to get the signal from the switch to whatever screen is broadcasting."
videography,36sfw1,Dovskey,2,Thu May 21 19:22:57 2015 UTC,"A good starting place  Break it down by hours first.  8 hour job? 4 day job?  Figure how much you wanna charge per hour/per day.  Let’s start at $15 an hr. and say it is a wedding you are shooting, just you, and this is your first gig ever.  The bride and groom-to-be want a two day shoot.  The day before you grab exterior/ interior shots, people coming in and set up.  Then the day of you want to capture people coming in, sitting down, mingling, the walk down the aisle, the kiss, the reception/ceremony, cutting the cake, people interviews/talking heads, etc.    Let’s say you have one camera.  First day may take 3-4 hours, just getting b-roll.  But the main day takes a full 8-12 hours.  You have to get in on the action, but stay out of the way, transfer footage, make sure you have enough battery power all the time, and have decent sound quality for talking head interviews with guests.  Then you have to edit the footage.  That could take anywhere from 3 hours to a whole month.  But let’s say it takes 16 hours (2 eight hour days).  You could keep track of your hours worked and bill after the fact.  Say you work 16 hours total =$240.  This is your minimum.  No equipment costs, transportation costs, labor, etc. etc. whatever.  You could add on those fees after or even before.  Let’s say you have a flat fee rate of $150.  This takes care of everything else like utilizing equipment, ensuring you have extra memory cards/drives, batteries, etc.  Now you just bumped up your price to $390.  You could put the editing fees in with your flat rate fee amount or even charge that additionally.  If so now you have $630 you can tell the client.  It’s really up to you to see how much they are thinking as well.  Since this is (I assume) your first gig, Just ask them how much they thought it would cost.  If they say $200 and you were expecting that $240 or that $390 or even the $630, then you should figure out if you can do it or not for which price.  It’s all up to you and how much you think your time is worth verses how much quality you can actually produce.  I suggest taking that low offer for first timers.  You gain experience and see how the gig runs so that next time it goes even better, plus you will mess up somewhere, everyone does, it just takes practice and knowledge to work around the mistakes.  Good luck!"

You can get a brand new A7 with a full Sony warranty for £799 from Amazon UK.  It's not as good a video camera as the A7s (more moire, less sensitive in low light, no 4K output), but shooters are nonetheless doing good work with it, as seen here:   Travelogue - New Zealand Sony A7 - First Look AMBER SOLEIL - Fashion Film   This camera would be a nice upgrade from your D3200.

I've used mine for a couple video projects and have been pretty happy with it, but it has a lot better usability than my 5d Mrk ii.   It's smaller, lighter, has peaking/zebras built in, electronic view finder, moveable screen, wifi uploading for photos, and the best thing is the 3 control dials, general video you're shooting full manual so having shutter speed, aperture, and ISO have separate dials is great. Then having several custom buttons for changing audio levels, or whatever is also very useful.   I've heard good things about the video from the Sony a5100, since it uses xavchd (on the a7s/a7ii as well), but it is crop, but I'm going to buy one to try out and maybe use as a b cam, or main if the video is that much better."

Like, truly ruin it and make it unusable.   What is the exact thing you are recording? Who and what do you need to get in your shots? You say it's a conference room, but do you only need to record one speaker or will you need footage of multiple people sitting in different places? Will you have time between ""segements"" to setup?

I will be recording 2 hour footage at times, maybe three throughout the day.  Not a whole lot of modification, configuration between footage hopefully.  Click the record and go. I will mount it on Tripod and it should be like clockwork. I want to record just the presenter, and obviously the people in the conference room that may have question....

videography,36oa17,AnneBancroftsGhost,3,Wed May 20 21:39:14 2015 UTC,"You don't need anything fancy for this. Get a regular camcorder that records HD. DSLRs have time limits that are way too short for you. But a camcorder will record as long as there is space on the card. A 32GB card at 1080p should get you about 4 hours of recording time. You're actually going to be more limited by battery life here. So bring a backup or two. Or better yet position yourself so you can have the camcorder plugged in to AC power.  For audio, grab a wired lav mic and put it on the presenter, plug the other end into the camcorder. Set levels to manual and monitor them yourself, do not use auto. Also pick up a cheap field recorder with built-in mic to place on the table to pick up any questions people may have. You won't be able to monitor these levels live, but still don't use auto mode. Find a middle-ground setting and leave it.  The quality of the footage is really up to you. If you know what you're doing with lighting, art direction, and framing, you can use the simplest of HD camcorders, but if you don't, not even the fanciest of cameras is going to help."

videography,36oec8,SnowyTom,2,Wed May 20 21:26:54 2015 UTC,I went out for a wander to a local park to get some test footage to try with DeLUTs - I'm really liking them as a starting point for a look. Used the 'Manchester' LUT in Premiere for these shots.
videography,36oec8,BRUTALLYHONESTCRITIC,8,Wed May 20 21:30:07 2015 UTC,"What camera was this shot on?  It looks REALLY, REALLY good, actually."
videography,36oec8,BRUTALLYHONESTCRITIC,1 point,Wed May 20 22:07:45 2015 UTC,Thanks! This was all on an A7s (cine4 gamma) with a Canon 100L macro.
videography,36oec8,BRUTALLYHONESTCRITIC,2,Thu May 21 10:08:31 2015 UTC,"Not SLog3?  I'm surprised and impressed by these LUT's.  I was thinking on the first shot, ""well it's very green biased""  Then, as the tilt finished, there was that gorgeous blue in those flowers and I immediately changed my tune.  Great job."
videography,36nkrr,agills,6,Wed May 20 18:12:31 2015 UTC,Avid has Fluid Morph that does the same thing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVW3dEFi9lE
videography,36nkrr,Jane__Says,2,Wed May 20 18:49:49 2015 UTC,Fluid morph is the way to go. I use premiere mainly but I took an intro Avid training class in which we had to use fluid morph as an exercise. Works excellently for what you need.

videography,36mvxb,demb3k,8,Wed May 20 16:11:34 2015 UTC,"If you have a monitor that's telling lies, I'd say it's time to get it calibrated."
videography,36mvxb,demux4555,2,Wed May 20 16:28:51 2015 UTC,"Sometimes the monitor is fine, your eyes lie. Especially if they've been grading for a while."
videography,36mvxb,ArtAdamsDP,-1,Wed May 20 22:45:03 2015 UTC,"Even then, a calibrated monitor only goes so far. If it can't show a wide gamut or show a high bit depth, then what's the point?"
videography,36mvxb,demb3k,2,Wed May 20 18:02:43 2015 UTC,"If colour grading and levels are of such importance, I'm sure you'd consider getting a more suitable monitor than having to rely on the scopes to get your colours ""perfect"" anyway.   Even so, a calibrated ""cheap"" monitor can do a really good job as long as it's calibrated properly.   It's not just about getting neutral colours (which can be done fairly easy using just graphs/scopes without even looking at the rendered image). It's also about setting a tone and atmosphere. And no graphs or scopes will help you set the colours you want/need if you cannot trust the monitor you're working on. You have to see the results of your adjustments with your own eyes."
videography,36mvxb,demux4555,1 point,Wed May 20 18:29:11 2015 UTC,"Well, that's kind of true. Thing is all the scopes, monitors etc in the world aren't going to change the environment that other people view your stuff in. Amping your investment in stuff for color correction will give you more confidence that your stuff looks good, but it'll never give you certainty.  That said, pro colorists do use both really expensive (often CRT) monitors and hardware scopes. 2 hour long source, can't remember anymore where he talks about scope usage, but it's an interesting video to watch if you have the time."
videography,36mvxb,Wurdan,1 point,Wed May 20 20:56:03 2015 UTC,"No art is correct, it doesn't matter if you have a $10,000 monitor  you still always use your scopes."
videography,36mvxb,MaxQuade,2,Thu May 21 23:00:36 2015 UTC,"I do both.  I prefer to use the scope for limits mainly, then eyeball any RGB adjustments."
videography,36mvxb,StuckRendering,2,Wed May 20 16:07:34 2015 UTC,Y waveform and rgb parade all day.
videography,36mvxb,ke5eaj,2,Wed May 20 17:34:08 2015 UTC,"Yes to both. If it looks right and the scopes are wrong, it's wrong. If the scopes are right and it looks wrong, it's wrong.   You have to be right on both.   As the earlier comments mention, RGB parade is absolutely essential if you are going to broadcast or international distribution."
videography,36mvxb,GuitarsAndCameras,1 point,Wed May 20 17:40:16 2015 UTC,"I use the RGB parade for white balancing (it's actually easier than eyeballing it), and only use a few other scopes if the end product is going to broadcast, or there are other specific requirements for white and black levels."
videography,36mvxb,videoworx,1 point,Wed May 20 16:56:38 2015 UTC,"Yup, use rgb parade for white balance and vectorscope for secondary colour correction of skintones. That said, if it's right on the scopes but I don't like the way it looks, I will make changes."
videography,36mvxb,Wurdan,1 point,Wed May 20 17:02:47 2015 UTC,I use scopes as the final part of my color correcting process as I move from scene to scene throughout a project to make sure there isn't one that goes off in a different way.

videography,36pw24,Hunter_behindthelens,1 point,Thu May 21 04:20:41 2015 UTC,"Film Riot did a video on storyboarding I've found useful in the past  And the good news is that you have experience in photography. What you can do is set up the stage and take photos of the different camera angles and stuff you want to get. If you can't set up a stage, make a graphic shotlist with some quick sketches.  EDIT: There are also a ton of AV script templates out there Really it's up to you which one fits your fancy."
