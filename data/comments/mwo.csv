mwo,3e55hu,supereliteninjatenno,2,Wed Jul 22 04:34:20 2015 UTC,what is narc?
mwo,3e55hu,supereliteninjatenno,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:14:28 2015 UTC,"u know the narc launcher   homing beacon/missile launcher, it lights mechs up to everyone and cancels ecm mechs , makes missile locks faster, longer and more accurate etc   with CN9-AH bonus with the Enhanced Narc module it has: 506m range, +12.5% cooldown, +30% duration & +20% velocity on high shoulder mount to fire behind terrain & leaves you with 6-7 tons of AC20 ammo to go nuts with the 32% ac20 cooldown"
mwo,3e55hu,wanzerr,4,Wed Jul 22 06:25:13 2015 UTC,Don't forget the harassment fun you can have with a CN9-D and an XL340
mwo,3e55hu,Portinski,4,Wed Jul 22 04:45:56 2015 UTC,"You want alpha, rather than sustained with centurions, because they are built for torso twisting. Try to use pieces of cover that you can just stick your arm around, then torso twist to quickly get out of sight after firing.  PS: Looks like someone went through and downvoted everyone in here. I have rectified the issue."
mwo,3e55hu,Mechronomicon,5,Wed Jul 22 05:00:13 2015 UTC,"That guide is up to date. If you're trying to outfit it without spending a lot of money, you'll probably want to try the standard engine version. Ultimately, though, you'll want to save up and equip it with an xl engine - you won't be able to tank as hard, but I've logged a lot of hours in Centurions and trust me, the improved speed and torso twisting are worth it.  Just a general tip with the CN9 - use alpha strikes to deal damage and twist away, so you can block with the left arm. Whenever you're not shooting the enemy, you should keep that left arm facing them so they have to melt the armor off it to get to your torso."
mwo,3e55hu,iohannes,3,Wed Jul 22 01:17:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks! one thing I thought was weird is because the left arm had no armor, is that the meta build for centurions?"
mwo,3e55hu,Mechronomicon,4,Wed Jul 22 01:29:28 2015 UTC,"The left arm without any armor is generally for shielding.  So, after you fire, you turn right and take the damage in your shield arm.  The internal structure of the arm is good for a few shots, and you can use the weight for other things."
mwo,3e55hu,Mechronomicon,3,Wed Jul 22 04:28:34 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, just realized that in this one, heh. I'm used to the Yen Lo Wang, it has energy hardpoints so you have more weight to play with, and you can have a full armor left arm. Keep in mind that Metamechs is the work of one guy, Gman, so you're seeing his take only. In the case of the AH, he's decided that packing in more firepower, ammo, and engine is worth having an arm with no armor. The arm still has hit points, though, and will absorb a little damage before it's blown off.  You can tweak the build a little if you'd like armor in  the arm - make it suit your taste and playstyle."
mwo,3e55hu,MaChIIInA,2,Wed Jul 22 01:45:45 2015 UTC,Thanks for all the help! I just need to grind out to afford all this.

mwo,3dytoq,MixMastaShizz,13,Mon Jul 20 17:17:19 2015 UTC,"Seeing this makes me truly disappointed in MWO.  MWLL needed some polish, but it had solid gameplay with true scale.  If PGI wants to see real success they should hire the MWLL modders and turn them loose."

mwo,3dytoq,downquark5,7,Mon Jul 20 22:51:22 2015 UTC,Yeah I was going to say the same thing...how have I never heard of this? You can even get out of your mech and run around on foot!!
mwo,3dytoq,thepulloutmethod,8,Tue Jul 21 01:12:07 2015 UTC,"MWLL nailed the sense of scale, map design, and good gameplay. MWO nailed the feel of mech combat, the animations, cockpit design. Combine the two and you'd have the ideal mech game."
mwo,3dytoq,RebasKradd,11,Tue Jul 21 01:12:36 2015 UTC,"Really?  Nailed the feel of mech combat?  If you know anything of the battletech/mechwarrior universe you'd know that mechs are supposed to be quick, agile, well moving, and versatile. Even the assault mechs were at very least smooth handling.  The mechs in MWO are clunky, at best. They feel very restrictive as far as movement goes. (And I typically played lightmechs.) And the maps feels like, well... they feel like being stuck in a box.  Animations?  I'll give you this. They do a pretty good job graphically, but I think there are detail points that they miss with some of their graphics implementations. But overall, yes, the visual effects are pretty legit if you have a PC that can run them. Though I don't think MWLL falls particularly short here, I will admit MWO edges the mod out in terms of visual elements.  Cockpit design? Eh, I personally disagree with that. I think the cockpits in MWO are alright, but nothing revolutionary for a mechwarrior game.  So that to say, if you took the visual elements and polish put into MWO and added it to MWLL, yes, you would have an ideal mech game."
mwo,3dytoq,ninjoe87,3,Tue Jul 21 06:21:07 2015 UTC,pfft.  The animation is a tad better than MW:LL; but they certainly did their best for free work.  on the otherhand mwo's animations are hella worse than MW4
mwo,3dytoq,vikingasianparadox,2,Tue Jul 21 20:24:49 2015 UTC,"I didn't have a great PC to play MW4 on, so I can't really say, the animations (at least, weapons animations, graphical effects) are better in MWO, I think. I can give them that.  But again, I never topped out MW4 graphics, so I could be completely wrong depending on what those look like modded or maxed out."
mwo,3dytoq,ninjoe87,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:41:00 2015 UTC,"Really? cuz I feel like everything is moving too fast, especially after elite skills. They are supossed to be massive constructs, but anything that's not an assault just feels like you're a guy in a suit, just jogging along like in any other FPS game.    I think they should be even clunkier if you want to induce the sense of scale and weight. Just my 2 cents."
mwo,3dytoq,DroopyTheSnoop,9,Tue Jul 21 07:08:24 2015 UTC,"According to the source material, they're supposed to be more nimble than pretty much anything else on the battlefield, so if you're not familiar with battletech or the mechwarrior universe, that point of view would make sense, and is just fine if that's what you want from a mecha game.  As far as elite skills, I can't say. I stopped putting my time and money into the game, because personally, I feel like it's trash, and that the devs don't actually care about anything besides the money. Which is fine, for them, I guess. But I like devs that put a little more care into their products, even if they're ultimately doing it for money, it's still nice when there's some manner of pride in their work. I don't feel like I get any of that from PGI."
mwo,3dytoq,ninjoe87,2,Tue Jul 21 07:31:23 2015 UTC,The ending to mechwarrior 2 mercenaries is perfect for showing the speed and nimbleness of how the mechs should move imo. Seeing that vulture run gives me nerd chills like no other.
mwo,3dytoq,DroopyTheSnoop,0,Tue Jul 21 12:03:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah I can understand your frustration with PGI. I have my gripes with them as well. I just have an irrational love of big stompy robots that keeps me playing.    But as far as being nimble is concerned I still think there's not much to complain about. Considering their size and weight, they turn and move pretty damn fast. If you'd compare the torso twist to that of a real world tank or something, I'd say it's faster than that (even for assault mechs)."
mwo,3dytoq,ninjoe87,3,Tue Jul 21 11:14:56 2015 UTC,"There's not much to complain about, if you're not considering the source material.  PGI's problem isn't their game in and of itself. It's that they picked an IP that has a VERY loyal following, very specific qualities to their mecha and lore, and they basically pissed on it. They were(are) lazy about every aspect except getting money out of customer's pockets. They put in what they thought mech combat should be, and not what the source material would have it be. This upsets the fanbase they are trying to sell to. Not only that, but it makes for a really fucking generic mech game.  I honestly am starting to believe that anyone that thinks MWO is a good Battletech/Mechwarrior game has no real clue what Battletech/Mechwarrior is. MW2, (it's expansions,) and MW3 (and it's expansions) were the last of actual good mech games published. MW4 was okay, but mediocre - however, it was miles above this shit PGI puts out."
mwo,3dytoq,RebasKradd,0,Tue Jul 21 20:33:23 2015 UTC,They weren't lazy. They were understaffed and undertrained with the engine.

mwo,3dytoq,dpidcoe,7,Mon Jul 20 17:37:28 2015 UTC,"It's a mod for Crysis Wars called Mechwarrior: Living Legends. It had mechs as well as combined arms (vehicles, aerospace, battlearmor etc). Super fun while active.  IIRC the MW:LL team abandoned the project once MWO started."
mwo,3dytoq,lldev,24,Mon Jul 20 17:42:27 2015 UTC,"IIRC the MW:LL team abandoned the project once MWO started.   No. Absolutely not. They were sent a cease and desist letter from PGI. To say it was abandoned implies everyone lost interest and willingly left.  Anytime someone groused about lack of MWO progress and compare it with the development pace of other games, people would say things like ""well mechs are more complicated"" or ""that game doesn't use the crysis engine"" or ""MWO is free to play"" or all sorts of other excuses. MWLL was a perfect comparison since it was mechs, same engine, small dev team, and all volunteer. PGI couldn't have that, so they called their lawyers and got the project shut down (even though MWLL had been squatting on the rights with permission from before MWO came along)."

mwo,3dytoq,dpidcoe,17,Tue Jul 21 04:11:42 2015 UTC,They were told to kill the project by PGI/IGP. At least some of the team has expressed that they would still be messing around on it if it wasn't for that. They didn't abandon it.

mwo,3e16ru,DroopyTheSnoop,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:00:18 2015 UTC,"Besides the advice from the other guys about upgrades and stuff, I'd like to tell you that it just takes some time adjusting from a light playstyle to a medium (even if it's a fully upgraded well built one) I had the same issues coming from a Raven to a Shadowhawk.      You have to play it more carefully. I know it sounds ridiculous since you've technically got more armor than a light, but your speed is about half than before so enemies will be getting more shots in. And yeah the firepower is better, especially and AC20, but it's still just that 20 damage, it won't really one shot anyone seeing as even lights have at least 20 points of armor on their ct.    What happened to you in the locust is probably that you got hit in the back (armor is 10 or less) and yeah your ct is probably about 10 so that's how you die instantly to an ac20.    Yeah so anyway the moral here is, play mediums even more cautiosly than you play lights. Pop up from a corner shoot and back off. Try to not facetank any other mech if you can help it. Look for oportunities to get some damage in safely, and if you can't just relocate instead of doing somethign stupid.    That's just my 2 cents, if anyone else knows other ways of playing mediums please share."

I never said he did 100% know, I said only an idiot wouldn't know, so I guess your answer will be he's an idiot and that I can agree with. Otherwise I don't have to prove anything, all I will do is make sure people know this tool was playing with a known and caught cheater for years. So either he was in on it or stupid. Either way I stand by his complicity or stupidity."

mwo,3dvt7b,Zekeocolypse,6,Sun Jul 19 23:14:16 2015 UTC,"I would definitely use a bigger engine, a top speed of 81 kmph is much too slow for a light mech, you will easily be run down by mechs much heavier than you. Light mechs need speed because of how little armour they can carry; they rely on being too quick to catch/shoot at and being able to reposition themselves quickly.   I recommend at least an XL 255, I know XLs are very expensive, but they are almost a necessity on most lights.  As for weapons, I think you want to get weapons that are closer in ranges so you could use all of your firepower effectively at once, right now if you are close enough for MGs you are too close for LRMs. I could be wrong for the weapons though, I am not very good at equipping lights.  Check out this site for more information: http://metamechs.com/"
mwo,3dvt7b,bman3k,5,Sun Jul 19 23:28:19 2015 UTC,"Focus on the energy hardpoints, the Ravens have good energy quirks all around that will help with your range and cooldown. The 4x can work with 2 ER Large Lasers, or just Large Lasers - check out http://metamechs.com/mwo-guides/master-guides/raven/ - it's a guide written by Gman, an experienced player and guru. You're going to need to save up money for an XL engine to really take advantage of the chassis."

mwo,3dvt7b,Mechronomicon,3,Sun Jul 19 23:24:16 2015 UTC,Stick with a long range assault. And by 'stick with' I mean stand so close to him (without blocking his movement) that no one in their right mind would shoot you before him. And then use your ER large and lrms to lay down some damage at range. Your goal right now is to get as much damage and as many assists as possible to grind experience and cbills.

mwo,3dvt7b,DoorMattt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:55:40 2015 UTC,You really do need double heat sinks. Always.   /u/kanajashi has done some YouTube videos on thunderbolts and ravens and shows how to play a cheap raven. I recommend getting the expensive engine in the end but until then you can check that out.
mwo,3dvt7b,Blouvalk,0,Mon Jul 20 07:04:03 2015 UTC,"In addition to what everyone else is saying, as a light you should ALWAYS have max armour on your legs. Movement is key in a light and if you get legged you're as good as dead.   On my 4X I play with 2 large pulse lasers, the beam duration is very short so it's great for poking."

mwo,3dvt7b,arcangleous,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:43:29 2015 UTC,"The 4X has some crazy energy quirks so you should use that to your advantage. It only has to energy hard points so you should stick something good in there. I'd say either 2 ER Large to get the craziest longest range you can imagine on a pair of lasers. Either that or use 2 Large which from the quirks will go about as far as ER Larges for not-quirked mechs. Both are valid options. I'd say ditch the LRMs. 5 missiles isn't going to do enough damage in the limitted windows where you can get locks. A light is not the best LRM carrier in general because of limited weight for ammo.    I'd say get the 2 LL or ERLL (they weigh the same) and then get an XL270 or XL275 engine and see how much space you have left. If you have a couple of tons Maybe you should think about getting some SRM4 with some ammo to help you out in those close range engagements. They're especially good for when your at an enemy assault mech's ass.    Other people have mentioned metamechs.com already you hsoudl check out the builds there for ideas. But in general decide on a weapon set and then get the fastest engine possible that goes with it and only after that, if you still have room add some backup/complementary weapons.    I play a Raven 3L with just 2 ERLL and I can get a lot done with just that. Of course the ECM helps a lot. You won't have that on the 4X, but what you do have is even better range and jump jets. So you play it sort of similar, poke from distances where they can't see you or they just can't reach you. Later on when the 2 sides come closer and you can't stay far enough anymore, just stick with a big friend who will draw the attention away from you. Be cheeky, poke and then hide/run. Reposition often. You should't give them the oportunity to shoot you back if you cna help it.    Hope that helps."
mwo,3dvt7b,Blouvalk,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:30:32 2015 UTC,"I've seen worse.   Step 1) Invest in Double Heat Sinks; This is always step one. Right now, you are sinking 13 hps (1 per single heat sink), and with an equivalent amount of DHS, you would sink 22.4 hps (14 for the heat sinks in the engine and 8.4 from 6 external heat sinks). With just the required 10 double heat sinks, you would sink 18.2 hps, a 40% improvement over your current build and it saves 3 tonnes while leaving you with only 4 critical slots to play with. Step 2) Choose your focus. Because of the way MWO works, it's a very bad idea to try to be good at everything. In your build, you have two long range weapons and two very very short range weapons. You are also mixing direct-fire and indirect fire weapons. It is entirely up to you, but in my opinion the non-huggin ravens tend to be better as snipers instead of brawlers. They definitely don't have the missile tubes to be use as an effective LRM-boat. I'd drop the LRM and the Machine Guns for a second ERLL. Step 3) Pump the engine. Given the limitations that light mechs have on armour, speed is literally life for them. Th faster you are moving, the quicker you can poke in and out to snipe, or close for brawling. Larger engines also provide more internal DHS, massively increasing your cooling range. I'm not a raven pilot myself, so I'm not sure how XL engine friendly they are, but speed is life."

mwo,3dvt7b,heimdeIight,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:48:06 2015 UTC,"As people have said, you need an XL engine but in the mean time ditch that lrm5 and throw in an srm4 if you want to use missiles. Lrm5s get eaten by anti missile system before they can impact. You'll need double heatsinks when you have the cash.  You can cut your head armour to 6 and shave a bit off the arms to save yourself a half ton.  You should move most of that rear armour to the front. Most players only use a few points of back armour and even less on a light. I'd go with 4."

Come on Heim, where is mums words ""Sticks and stones..."""
mwo,3dyj5y,heimdelight,-3,Mon Jul 20 21:11:23 2015 UTC,"Lol, first and foremost, I play this game to have fun. The only things I take seriously are business-time type things, such as competitive play. You do understand I am literally using /r/OutreachHPG and /r/MWO for notoriety and infamy, right? I don't want to be the nice guy who gets his nuts licked by the community and basking in all the favoritism (reddit is just a glorified, subjective popularity contest) because I've already experienced that before in life through other ways.  You don't see me banned from the MWO client, MWO forums, or banned from literally anywhere else, do you? That's usually because: 1. Places aren't dumb enough to ban me over calling people retarded/stupid/dumb/idiotic. 2. Places that do have rules like that happen to be /r/OutreachHPG.  Like, if I wanted my real life personality to associate with my account name I'd probably care a lot more.   So let me understand this correctly... insulting people or ""casting them into irrelevance"" is not treating someone like shit?   Excuse me, but if you want to judge me solely based on what I've said to people, even then you'd find majority of the time I don't cast people off into irrelevance (considering I continue talking to most of them with at least a legitimate point to make) and majority of the time I don't insult (unless I'm being insulted, of course.)  If I was as bad a person as everyone said I was and as bad as people treated me, I'd be out of here a long time ago and wouldn't have put nearly as much effort into the community as I have.  So, anyone telling me that nothing I've done for the community matters because I act like a 13 yr old CoD kid on purpose to make people mad is just being ridiculous and shallow."

Also you'll note that the larger and original reddit for the game has become a nest of negativism because the free market allows it. The carefully protected hugbox at Outreach can't operate on the free market as it needs to remove criticism.

Typically if it runs into a problem it will catch it and spit out an error. I recently had an issue where I installed a new VPN client, which in turn caused an issue with MWO (and a few other programs) because of an update it made to the framework.  Granted, without an error message, there's no way to say for sure, but that's a pretty common failure point. It may be worth looking at updating or running the repair tool for the .Net framework in any case. You also may want to check your Application and System logs to see if there were any related crash dumps that got written to your PC prior to it locking up.  Hope this helps!"

mwo,3dopld,AdverseTFV,4,Sat Jul 18 03:27:46 2015 UTC,I've always thought it was too easy to see mechs and that their cammo didn't play enough of a role. It could go the other direction like WoT and make them invisible until they are in a range based on their cammo vs your sight ability. I think as a pilot you should be able to blend in and others should have to use targeting reticles to find you if their computer is picking them up. I know its not making a huge difference in the meta but I guess I see this as a nonissue.

For lack of a better term, it adds to realism.   Visibility could be better, but fog, debris, trees and shit are all things that are good. I dont want to play in some sterile Doom2 arena where everything is clearly visible at all times. What it seems like gman is describing is a completely different style of game than this game has ever said it would be. highlighting mechs? yea, that wouldnt be a fucking disaster in this game. This game doesnt need to be made easier. targeting doesnt need to me MORE accurate and easier to do, things dont need to be even easier to spot at a distance and then destroy through sniping, being able to pick out parts to shoot, even if they're behind non-solid trees isnt something that needs to be done  and with a better graphics engine, those issues would be less of an issue to people with those issues, like gman. At least i think so."

mwo,3dopld,Krivvan,2,Mon Jul 20 02:59:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's a less visibility vs more visibility issue so much as a low visibility done badly issue.

The mechs are the tougher to kill than in any other title. The controls are worse, and the mechs slower. Visibility is crap, and frankly, compared to MW2, 3, and 4, sniping is a joke."
mwo,3dopld,Krivvan,2,Sat Jul 18 17:18:15 2015 UTC,The controls definitely aren't the worst. MW4 was extremely clunky in comparison. MWO is responsive enough to be considered a shooter.

mwo,3dopld,SJR_Gut,2,Sat Jul 18 21:40:04 2015 UTC,"But MWO's an FPS with vehicle sim elements. It's far better suited for mouse control and was never designed for joystick controls. The mouse is the best tool for the given job, not the joystick."
mwo,3dopld,Mokux,0,Sat Jul 18 22:50:38 2015 UTC,"A lot of people (read: longterm fans of the series) see that as a design flaw. And actually, a joystick is pretty useful, it just needs to be in your left hand as a two axis throttle control, instead of in your right hand for aiming and shooting."

Particularly with the strength of the c3 in game (could be a way to balance lrms also). I wish they did a WoT style camo system where you could set different camo's for different map types.

mwo,3dkik9,stefchy,3,Fri Jul 17 00:29:56 2015 UTC,"A couple of suggestions:  1) I only see the video in 720p - you want at least 1080p. Though this could be because YouTube hasn't processed the higher quality version yet.    2) It's hard to tell because of (1), but it seems that  you have rendered at a different framerate to what the source was captured in. This is OK if the output framerate exactly divides into the source framerate (eg capturing at 60FPS and rendering at 30FPS is OK, it will use every other frame), but capturing at, say 25FPS and rendering at 30FPS is not OK - it will need to ""blend"" frames (Make up new frames by merging the two frames either side) which results in a ""Ghosting"" effect. If changing capture or output FPS is not an option, turn off Frame Blending in your video editor. This may result in less smooth motion though.    3) The black at the start is too long.    4) The music is maybe a bit too energetic.    5) When you change clip, try and cut in time with the beat. Changing clips in the middle of a bar of the music jars the viewer. (4) Would probably be less of an issue if you did this.    Hope this helps."

The bubble should not provide any protection to teammates and should have no effect whatsoever on direct LRM fire from outside. To say the least, ECM should be a rather weak equipment and certainly not a game-breaker.  We are as far from this implementation as PGI is from understanding their own franchise.  Edit: more info"
mwo,3dg628,Altaweir,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:17:47 2015 UTC,"Actually, ECM doesn't prevent IDF. It prevents C3 transmissions, however- but does nothing to prevent a unit from spotting normally.

No, seriously. It's shit. C3i would mean your friends all magically got to shoot at targets as if they were at the best range. ""Can't do anything when spotting"" got obliterated from tabletop rules over a decade ago at this point, meaning that yep, you can be fighting and still have someone friendly use you as a spotter for indirect fire (not just LRMs, but mortars, etc. etc.).  ECM canceled -advanced- electronics, like Artemis IV, but didn't magically prevent you from lobbing LRMs at a target- or having someone spot for you, for that matter. It DID kill C3 systems. (And only the second-gen Angel ECM prevented Streak lockons, but in that case they reverted to standard-style missile launchers that happened to be heavier than the usual ones.)"

My guess.  They can't code a whole new ECM functionality but they can at least change the range.  After all those hard counters to ECM...PPC BAP TAG UAV NARC anotherabbreviation...   first in many steps of getting role and information warfare more relevant in the game   But the pillars were complete!  They said so!

Why is it crazy? Explain why.   At 90m it makes much more sense. (I actually tested at 60m and that makes even more sense but that is too high of a nerf to range to start.)

mwo,3dg628,CivetSeattle,2,Mon Jul 20 21:22:27 2015 UTC,Ah all sorts of ideas have been put forward. Regardless of the mechanic chosen one thing I've always found poor is that ECM currently prevents firing which is the fun part. Whichever way you design it I think the tollbooth of effectiveness should be placed after that. Buffs to range/damage/spread. Counters to same. Something organic that a target can work with to minimise impacts and that doesn't result in a missile boat staring directly at an enemy yet having no dog in the fight.

Seems odd that the unmoderated sub is larger and negative and the carefully censored hugbox is smaller and positive. I think that should say a lot more to the new player than sad sacks trying to get new blood to save their precious pixels.

mwo,3d76mf,RebasKradd,5,Tue Jul 14 15:20:22 2015 UTC,"You mean the minimally viable features they've spent 2015 upgrading?   Do you remember what we talked about before? That thing about how kicking something out the door no matter what state it's in and slapping a release tag on it doesn't count? Mechlab only took them 3 years of ignored feedback despite being the UI being the most asked for thing for 3 years running. And it's still not where it should be. You expect me to believe that they're going to be out there fixing the myriad of little things if it takes them that long to fix the big stuff?   Or perhaps their firing of the CM who was doing those bannings?   That's a nice bit of revisionist history. Do you forget what it took for them to finally fire him? Does PGI becoming a laughingstock to the entire gaming world for their CM getting the entire company banned from reddit ring any bells? Also, quit trying to make him a scapegoat. There were other moderators (and even CEOs) who were also responsible for incorrect bannings, it's a systemic problem, not something you can pin on one person.  Also, PGI never should have hired Niko after he left IGP. He had already established his behavior pattern, it's not like they didn't know what they were getting. It's pretty damning that they ignored all of the times he abused his position as a CM to openly and unabashedly ""troll"" people (and then brag about it, in public), only taking notice when he got the entire company banned.   And the lead designer's undesirable personality is a pretty small thing to be asking an entire company to grovel over.

Are you retarded? As I've said every other time you claim this, MWLL was much more feature complete and developed faster than MWLL. They weren't making money from it, had no direct engine access, and it's basically a 1:1 comparison in terms of gametype and complexity. Then PGI went and shut them down."
mwo,3d76mf,dpidcoe,3,Wed Jul 15 04:15:31 2015 UTC,"And let's not forget the incredible rapid progress that directly analogous games like World of, War Thunder and especially Warframe enjoy. Glacial isn't a great word for what PGI do. Glacial implies a large object moving slowly. PGI just toss some gravel out the window once every few months and want their cock sucked for it.  Basically - If you caught Russ Bullock with a dead baby in one hand and a bloody hammer in the other this Rebas clown would accuse the hammer of having an agenda and the baby of misreporting the facts. Apparently the role of chairman and indeed the responsibility of an owner for the companies fortunes and behaviour isn't something he either understands or is willing to concede."
mwo,3d76mf,InertiamanSC,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:10:29 2015 UTC,"For a crowd that constantly bashes MWO for pushing nothing but content out the door, you have some serious nerve to praise Warframe. The only significant recent changes to Warframe's base game are a new (and controversial) UI, a retool of the map tiles in the same way MWO is currently doing, a new game mode in the form of Interception, and fucking ARCHWING that nobody plays anymore because the rewards are nonexistent.    Literally everything else DE pushes out is more mindless grindy obsolete on release weapons and a new frame every few months.   Oh, and limited time weapons that are blatantly better than the base model, which means that all your effort and forma you put into your Twin Vipers was wasted as soon as you acquired the Twin Wraith Vipers, which 80% of the population won't even get to use anyway."
mwo,3d76mf,HeliosRX,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:19:05 2015 UTC,It's entirely possible to praise a development schedule without measuring the merits of the resulting product. War thunder has its longevity issues also but you can bet the patches come thick and fast and do not require zero day fixing each and every time.      Maybe take a wider view of the context before accusing anyone of hypocrisy.
mwo,3d76mf,InertiamanSC,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:36:09 2015 UTC,"The concept you used to refer to the the games was progress.   I haven't stuck with WT or WoT long enough to comment on those.   But you most certainly cannot say that Warframe is 'progressing' quickly in any direction. It has a patch and hotfix cycle that is both faster and more efficient than MWO, but constant bugfixes and balance changes do not develop the game further in any noticeable way - all the real game-changing glitches were removed a long time ago.   A more active development cycle is not indicative of better progress, and Warframe is a fantastic example of how you can throw all your effort into making the game look pretty while taking 2+ years to achieve some sense of balance.   2 years of PPC Gauss meta in MWO where other weapons were at the very least useable is nothing compared to the 2+ years in Warframe where it was literally useless to take any frame other than Nova, Rhino, Trinity or Nekros into a survival or defense mission.   Finally, I don't think you realize that companies change over the years. MWO has improved significantly in the past year and a half, and I will admit that Warframe has slowly undergone similar improvements over the past two years. But just like the IGP/PGI this sub likes to bash on, DE at one point used to release almost literally no content except more useless weapons. From update ~8 to update ~14 there was a single top tier primary, a single top tier secondary, and 2 melee weapons worth taking, one of which was used purely as a transportation tool."

Going strictly from memory, basically people with inside knowledge (both Niko and one of the developers who answered questions on reddit) gave similar stories. One of them was that Paul printed out player suggestions from the forums, put a failed stamp on them, and then they got passed around the office to be laughed at. iirc it was Niko who said they'd all look at player suggestions during meetings and facepalm.  It was one of those things that was a bit shocking. You'd think it was just hyperbole over a comment taken out of context or something, but those comments didn't really leave much room for misinterpretation."
mwo,3d76mf,dpidcoe,5,Tue Jul 14 19:40:16 2015 UTC,"You're getting two instances mixed together here. Karl Berg mentioned in his questions thread that the game designers started an internal wiki thread to keep all their shit together and Paul would go through their ideas and put a giant red ""Fail"" stamp on each of them with his feedback.  During one of the community firestorms Niko posted that one quote from the creator of Pokemon and tried to apply it to MWO to get angry people even angrier:   ""You all think you have great ideas for Pokemon games, but if I actually listened to all of you and we combined all of your ideas in a game, it would be an unplayable monstrosity. You want a game with all the regions, but only the first generation Pokemons, yet all the legendary ones and such silly things. Whenever I receive one of these rants, I go to the development floor and read it out loud to all the Game Freak employees in a mocking voice, and we all laugh at you.""

Given the small population, balance is already pretty hit or miss so hopefully the server will be assigned last, but physics dictates there's only so much 'extra servers' can do if a player from bozeman montana wants to play a game against an opponent from india - at least one of those players will get a crummy ping."

Honestly, it doesn't seem like it makes a difference whether I'm active on Reddit or not, and I don't think anyone will argue with that.  Like I said in an earlier comment: this isn't supposed to be some serious post or anything. it was a funny video I linked to here.   Of course, if someone else had posted this link, a comment like yours would have never been posted. So, idk if you want some serious conversation on this subject matter or not but I'm just here for some laughs. What are you here for?

I really don't care about comment or link karma, don't make alternative accounts, etc. You get what you see.  I definitely use Reddit far less than I did before. I don't participate in majority of the discussions, etc. Or am I not allowed to slowly stop using something? I wasn't aware there were departure procedures other than me saying I won't be using Reddit anymore, or nearly as much, and won't be treating it like a serious community.  Is there anything wrong with what I'm doing here? You've genuinely confused me, and it's clear your misunderstanding from my first thread is carrying over into this one. If you're having a hard time understanding everything I'm saying, feel free to PM me (or continue discussing it here).  For you, I'll spend some time. You are mildly enjoyable to argue with.  Besides, you didn't answer any of my questions. Just continued to tell me that I was lying before, bringing up me saying, ""I would never use Reddit again"".

Basically, you can save a mech configured properly with regard to tonnage, but the mech saves improperly and you can't launch because of an invalid configuration.  It will result in either an over tonnage error or critical save error.  It's a mild nuisance as it doesn't happen all the time, but I've had it happen a few times when swapping mecha configurations."

mwo,3d4ub7,Kamikaze_VikingMWO,2,Mon Jul 13 23:17:45 2015 UTC,"They nerfed it into the ground about a year ago so you just missed a time in which you may have had actual fun but they also improved upon the game A LOT. Just recently they increased ppc and erppc speeds again but not by too much. Also to note many mechs still have their ppc speed and erppc speed buffs which makes those which have the ppc and erppc buffs go that much faster but luckily for you I would say no high tier mech has any erppc or ppc velocity buffs. Consequently that meta is somewhat there but not as prevalent as laser vomit or stacking a bunch of laser weapons on your mech. For example the Thunderbolt 5ss is quirked heavily for medium pulse lasers, so many people like to run 7 medium pulse lasers on it. The timber wolf and stormcrow at one point were heavily nerfed because of the laser builds you could run on them increasing the duration of those lasers by ~25% but those were taken away for the most part so now it is ~8% duration increase making the builds less appealing but still powerful. Keep in mind this is my opinion on where energy weapons stand. If you want I could talk about the state that ballistic weapons are in generally."

mwo,3d4c5v,Dei-Ex-Machina,2,Mon Jul 13 13:17:53 2015 UTC,"You're in luck, BJ-1X is better than ever with quirks (bonuses to underperforming mechs which for everything from weapon heat generation to internal structure). With ghost heat (firing more than a certain amount of one type of weapon generates more heat) you'll want to run 6ML/2MPL."

mwo,3d4c5v,jamesjk1234,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:28:37 2015 UTC,Can you explain the clan mechs to me? I still don't have a computer able to play on but I've been sort of making a list of mechs as my first purchases back.  I just am not understanding the clan mechs. Are you able to purchase them? The website doesn't have a lot of description and even says there's a limited amount of certain mechs left. Just doesn't make sense.   Sorry for being such a noob. I'm not on top of the lure and just feel overwhelmed with all of the new stuff.
mwo,3d4c5v,curiousmechwarrior,2,Wed Jul 15 02:09:26 2015 UTC,"Can you explain the clan mechs to me?   If you mean gameplay, they are quite different from innersphere mechs.  Engines, weapons, omnipods, and cbill price are just a few examples of many differences.   Are you able to purchase them?   Yes.  With real money or with ingame cbills.   there's a limited amount of certain mechs left   Those might be the gold mechs.  The a la carte allows you to buy the mechs you want anyway with real money.  But if you have lots of time, don't waste your money and buy the mechs for cbills.  Buying MC with real money is better since you can purchase hero mechs and mech bays.  Mech bays have priority.  Please know that you don't need to buy Clan mechs.  They are overpriced and innersphere mechs are just as good for having fun."

You can even play with mechs from the store without buying them. *  These days www.metamechs.com is a better choice for mechbuilds.  ComstarNA is a decent place to find groups, but you're better off finding a decent unit.   ...and that guide is so outdated it's almost useless. I'll try and find a better one when I am back at my desk.  EDIT: * The in-game mechlab is now okay to build in, but smurfy's is still better in most cases. Should have made the clearer."
mwo,3d4c5v,curiousmechwarrior,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:47:27 2015 UTC,that guide is so outdated   I was unaware that 03 February 2015 was out of date.  I can imagine that MWO is completely different since then.   I'll try and find a better one   Please do.  I normally find players advertising aspects of the game rather than explaining them in detail.
mwo,3d4c5v,LordSkippy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:05:41 2015 UTC,"Metamechs is a better place to start, but mechspecs is still nice to see some variety in builds.  I usually start with the metamech tier listed variant build, then tweak it to my tastes.  If I really don't like the look of it, then I'll look at other build on mechspecs.  Smurfy is still better to build in because of the additional information about performance and you can add equipment that you can't afford in game.  But the new ecpanded view in the Mechlab is a lot better than it was before."
mwo,3d4c5v,Dei-Ex-Machina,0,Mon Jul 13 18:32:01 2015 UTC,"The problem with mechspecs is there is just so much trash, and so little that's decent. It's contributed mainly by some of the most casual members of the community. For a new player it's awfully hard to filter out the garbage, so I can't recommend it at all.  There are also things smurfy doesn't show particularly easy, like quirks. This is especially important with Clan omnipods and negative quirks. The lack of this feature makes the in game mechlab more useful these days. Being in a browser and sharing builds makes Smurfy more accessible though.  You also don't need to purchase anything to play with the in game mechlab."
mwo,3d4c5v,LordSkippy,2,Tue Jul 14 01:04:31 2015 UTC,"You don't need to purchase anything with the in game Mechlab, no.  However, it won't let you equipment items unless you have enough C-bills to purchase it.  Only have 2M C-bills, can't put that 300XL on the mech, even just to play around with the build, unless you have one in inventory.  Maybe it's different if you enter through the store, but that's how it is if you enter view the Mechlab tab."

I haven't been strapped for C-bills since the new Mechlab came out, and that was not listed as one of its new features.  But, if repeatly point out that I was wrong and you were right about an undocumented feature in a video game makes you feel better about yourself, that's cool, I guess.

mwo,3d4c5v,primalchrome,8,Tue Jul 14 14:08:10 2015 UTC,"I really wish the mods here would let this subreddit move on to new mods that actually care about MWO.  Not care about FASA, or Battletech, or Mechwarrior, or Harmony Gold, or Activision, or PGI, or IGP.....mods that care about MWO.  Yes, there are people that feel they were done wrong by the entire development of MWO.  People that spent money and were not pleased with the product or feel they were misled/lied to....  These people are angry and in pain and cannot deal with it in a healthy manner.  So what they are doing now with /mwo is not taking that anger out on IGP or PGI or even MWO....they're taking it out on the playerbase that still enjoys the game or new players that are trying to find out about the game.  New kid that's 14 discovers /mwo and decides to feel out the community of the game he and his buddies have started playing....and all they get is hate and vitriol.  Because they wanted to have fun.  It is wrong.  It is sad.  It is why this sub is dying."
mwo,3d4c5v,dpidcoe,3,Mon Jul 13 16:55:28 2015 UTC,These people are angry and in pain and cannot deal with it in a healthy manner.   They were scammed. They're attempting to warn other people and prevent those people from also being scammed. You think that's unhealthy?

mwo,3d4c5v,vikingasianparadox,4,Mon Jul 13 18:30:48 2015 UTC,"Ah this game again, MWO.  Glad I left.  As for this ""sub"" dying.... hmm, let's take a look at the dying population of MWO itself:  Main forums (700ish people), General Discussion (200ish, and often gets below 100), Community Warfare (21 users, lol).  This game is a just a wasteland with tumbleweeds at this point.  The forums used to be bustling with thousands of excited people, many cautious, and others hopeful with lots of suggestions.  You can see new players suggesting things in that graveyard the feature suggestion place of things that were suggested years ago.  Those pour souls.   nothin' else to talk about and if there is its probably a repeat, the game is mediocre, and compared to the classics, a boring slog.  that is all"
mwo,3d4c5v,russ_bollocks,0,Mon Jul 13 19:55:16 2015 UTC,"I don't get it, seems like working as intended. New players stumble on to this awful game and get warned off before the spent money or get emotionally invested like the shills over at Outreach. BTW it's not the sub that's dying, it's the game. The faster it dies the faster the license goes to a new team that is hopefully competent and has learned what not to do from the example provided by PGI.  If you want a place to enjoy your Stockholm Syndrome and cheer on PGI head right over to the hugbox that is Outreach. It's everything you want, lickspittles and rubes abound. Nary a criticism to be heard."
mwo,3d4c5v,pixelbaron,4,Mon Jul 13 18:28:20 2015 UTC,Uhh excuse me approx. 200 browsing two subs and not even 1k people on the official forums is VERY healthy for a game. In fact it's spot on perfect.
mwo,3d4c5v,russ_bollocks,6,Mon Jul 13 21:39:13 2015 UTC,"It's fucking awesome listening to the white knights talk about the game doing well. They really don't play actually healthy games that have growing communities and thriving forums and reddits. They really think the numbers are ok. I think they really do believe it is doing great. Steam, if it ever happens is going to be quite the wake up. Can't wait to watch them brag about their numbers to people who play other games."
mwo,3d4c5v,pixelbaron,9,Mon Jul 13 23:21:42 2015 UTC,"MWO will do the classic Steam client/standalone client split and then white knights will use this excuse: ""Steam only counts the population for the Steam client and not the other client so you have to add at least 5 billion more players to the playerbase because of all the people on the original standalone client"" lmao  They are so easy to predict."
mwo,3d4c5v,russ_bollocks,4,Tue Jul 14 00:00:47 2015 UTC,"Who cares what they say. Once the game gets general exposure and people see what state it's in that'll be it. They already make excuses for what they can't do because there aren't enough players. Steam holds some hope for the rubes that in will bring in a huge influx of people who will stay and spend. When that fails to occur, well then the non white knights will know it's officially up and there's nothing left after Steam. Then it's just a matter of how long the whales can keep the servers up while PGI tries to exit doing as little as possible.  I for one can't wait. The fact that many of the Outreach crew can't wait either is epic."
mwo,3d4c5v,vikingasianparadox,4,Tue Jul 14 03:09:43 2015 UTC,"the best part is the game got general exposure years ago;  and the general gaming community groaned when they saw it was f2p, instead of a Mech Warrior 5 thing, and were like, ""yeah, passing on this.""  mwo is literally the most epic slog grind-fest game in the franchise and its kind of sad that young kids these days don't get to experience a decent MW that doesn't pinch pennies from ya like how like how it was when I was younger"

If this game wasn't the only BT/MW game available do you think it would even still be running? Look how great PGI's previous games and attempt a future product worked? This awful repetitive unbalanced arena shooter with mech skins only limps along because people have convinced themselves better a half assed arena shooter with mech skins than no game or that if this game fails there will never be another MW/BT game.

If you want bad examples, thedailywtf has some pretty good ones (generally overly generic stuff is called ""enterprise"").  Unfortunately at work all of the code changes I do are on already established things, so not much room to practice software design on. It's also mostly embedded devices, so the lack of OS defined memory management combined with the initial code having been written by EEs who read a C for dummies book once makes it pretty hard to reuse things."

mwo,3cytj2,pixelbaron,8,Sun Jul 12 05:15:12 2015 UTC,"God. I come back to this. You got fucking reckt.  Kernals  How does it feel to know you are so powerless now. You, that lost his modship?"
mwo,3cytj2,Beersaltz,2,Sun Jul 12 09:32:17 2015 UTC,"Week 8 is finally over after that whole debacle, and 228th will be playing SJR next week in the final match of the elimination bracket on Caustic Valley. It should be a fun set of matches, and I hope people show up to win free Mechbays.  In terms of frequency, I wouldn't say anything has changed. I put out lots of updates before the tournament started to attract attention, and I always post match notices. I was doing the week in review video posts until after Week 5, but that's 100% laziness. There will be a few other posts about prizes and payouts soon, and the lull of the last three weeks has been entirely due to the roster shenanigans.  Not that you actually wanted an update. I know you were just being a prick, but maybe someone somewhere out there on this pitiful sub wanted to know =P"
mwo,3cytj2,Homeless-Bill,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:55:58 2015 UTC,228th?  You mean the group that held 5 of those 60 or so cheaters that PGI banned the other month?   I'm sure that will be a great match to watch.
mwo,3cytj2,CivetSeattle,-1,Tue Jul 14 21:25:04 2015 UTC,"It's hilarious for you to call a sub pitiful, I guess you don't have mirrors over there at outreach. Aren't there PGI boots to be licked, how can you afford to spend time here when some one might be saying something critical on outreach that needs purging."
mwo,3cytj2,russ_bollocks,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:19:06 2015 UTC,"Oh, this is precious. The guy who got removed from moddership of a sub with an almost-no-moderation rule wants to lecture others because someone cheated in their tournament. Got any more straws to grasp?"

mwo,3cytj2,Beersaltz,10,Sun Jul 12 09:42:33 2015 UTC,Subscriptions mean nothing.  It's all about the active users.
mwo,3cytj2,LeX420,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:26:20 2015 UTC,"What does that mean: ""active""?   Subscribers which use their brain and voice actively? Or just user who upvote glossy advertisements?"
mwo,3cytj2,Filter41,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:54:49 2015 UTC,Both?
mwo,3cytj2,LeX420,-1,Mon Jul 13 14:14:14 2015 UTC,"Correct, but just note that number is higher for outreach."
mwo,3cytj2,Jammerben87,3,Sun Jul 12 10:26:21 2015 UTC,Thanks Captain obvious.
mwo,3cytj2,LeX420,3,Sun Jul 12 15:20:45 2015 UTC,"Your comment implies you were arguing what op was saying, but the numbers support him. I was just pointing it out."
mwo,3cytj2,Jammerben87,3,Sun Jul 12 17:45:08 2015 UTC,Seems a bit stagnant in here too: http://redditmetrics.com/r/mwo  And for comparison: http://redditmetrics.com/r/OutreachHPG
mwo,3cytj2,x7x_,2,Sun Jul 12 18:25:00 2015 UTC,"over 3,700 subscriptions   Such a great representation of the MWO population.  It can only go up!"
mwo,3cytj2,curiousmechwarrior,0,Sun Jul 12 03:27:32 2015 UTC,"Should be one less but I read that Siriothrax white listed a shadow banned a member of NGNG (Cattra). I'm sure its old news to many but I just read it today.  Like seriously? You have to white list a paid PGI shill just to keep shilling the place up? What a fucking loser, just leave the dude banned FFS. Then they allow other NGNG like Bombadill to keep spamming grab deal news all the time like some fucking ad bot moron. If I was the admin there first order of business would be to boot them all out asap."
mwo,3cytj2,J0ke,3,Sun Jul 12 03:09:59 2015 UTC,"Shills gotta stick together, I mean these folks have financial and emotional investements and some even actually get paid to spread the PGI propaganda."
mwo,3cytj2,russ_bollocks,4,Sun Jul 12 04:42:55 2015 UTC,"Hey hey Siri doesn't deserve all the credit. The King Carebear was in on that decision too. We have no clue why he was shadowbanned in the first place and he wasn't violating any of our rules, so we got him out of our spam queue.  Some here will say it's a bunch of self-promotion, but what the hell else would get posted? Metamechs.com? Self-promotion. Rak's Armory? Self-promotion. MWO links? Self-promotion. NGNG stuff? Self-promotion? Every youtube video ever linked on our sub? Self-promotion. What do you think that M.A.V. shit everyone here was eating up? Self-promotion. And was that a bad thing?  Whatever you hilarious, salty bastards. It's a fan sub for a fucking game. We've got criticism, suggestions, and news, but we've also got a boatload of solid content that comes from users that promote their own work, and people aren't going to exclude sales from the information that gets posted. Bombadil posts weekend updates and that's it. If he didn't do it, someone else would. And sales are posted by whoever gets to it first. What would you have us do - censor sales or PGI-related posts? Why not be safe and just censor MWO-related content?  If criticism on Outreach was censored, it would be one thing, but it's not. The users may downvote you because they like the game (hanging around the subs for games you actually enjoy - what a concept) and are more resistant to criticism, but that doesn't mean you aren't welcome to make it. And you of all people should know that. Look at your posting history and tell me we're censoring negativity with a straight face."
mwo,3cytj2,Homeless-Bill,7,Sun Jul 12 09:20:43 2015 UTC,we've also got a boatload of solid content   Unlike MWO itself AMIRITE.
mwo,3cytj2,InertiamanSC,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:23:50 2015 UTC,"Some here will say it's a bunch of self-promotion, but what the hell else would get posted?   well that kind of flies in the face of your ""But we're teh active one!"" theory.  also, wasnt it PGI that got themselves banned for using reddit to advertise their product? How does having the PGI paid NGNG crew doing it change that any?"
mwo,3cytj2,-ParticleMan-,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:52:02 2015 UTC,"""Censor sales or PGI-related posts"" - yes, this is what I think should happen. Its a sub for the fans like you said. Fan made materials and content, fan discussions, news written by the fans, etc.  Why would you need PGI or people working for PGI to come in and spam their grab deal bullshit all the time? You want official news? Go to the official site and fucking read about it yourself. Outreach should be for the fans and the community, not a place for PGI to advertise their shit. Boot the fuckers out HB, I know you guys can do it.  I'm not talking about criticism in outreach at this point. Other people have been critical there besides myself and its been fine. People seem to be more receptive about it in Outreach these days and the discussions seem more well balanced. MWO is a bad game, so of course in time even the few left who defend PGI could start to think twice."
mwo,3cytj2,J0ke,3,Sun Jul 12 15:21:45 2015 UTC,Fuckin NGNG :(  Bombadil is such a shill.  Yes. Kick em ALL!
mwo,3cytj2,LeX420,2,Sun Jul 12 03:16:20 2015 UTC,"He totally is 100%, look at his last few posts. Not sure how even Outreach allows this. ""HEY GUYZ NEW GRAB DEALS FOR SALE MUST BUY SO AWSOME"""
mwo,3cytj2,J0ke,-1,Sun Jul 12 03:33:00 2015 UTC,"You know, you could always not click on the NGNG links if thats whats ruffling your panties so much, lol.   They do fine work in my opinion.. they get paid to do what they enjoy doing. I have to admit, it would be pretty cool to be paid to do anything with MechWarrior. They have a successful business, good for them. No need to feel personally attacked just because they throw a video up with an ad every now and then. Other people watch em', other people enjoy them.. whats wrong with that?  Like I said, no one is forcing anyone to watch their ads or videos. It seems pretty silly to take such offense over that."
mwo,3cytj2,PoLaR_XI,2,Mon Jul 13 12:30:00 2015 UTC,Huh? I'm talking about reddit posts not clicking links.

mwo,3cytj2,LeX420,-1,Sun Jul 12 02:24:54 2015 UTC,I don't even know who they are beyond a team that got caught cheating in a cash tournament and didn't take it well. Homeless-Bill has since stopped gracing us with advertisements for said tournament since the cheating announcement (probably out of embarrassment the poor lil shill) and if you mention it in his kingdom it tends to disappear so I figured I'd mention it in every new player thread and parody thread whenever I see em lmao
mwo,3cytj2,pixelbaron,7,Sun Jul 12 02:30:51 2015 UTC,So basically you are just a douche-nozzle?
mwo,3cytj2,dugant195,3,Sun Jul 12 02:38:02 2015 UTC,You're just now figuring this out?
mwo,3cytj2,pixelbaron,-2,Sun Jul 12 03:14:25 2015 UTC,"He's not holing back on calling them out for cheating in a cash prize tourney and you are giving him shit for it, but HE is the douche-nozzle....  Think about that for a minute."
mwo,3cytj2,heavy_metal_flautist,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:40:30 2015 UTC,"He isn't calling them out on anything....they aren't even in this conversation. They aren't tangentially related to this conversation. They have literally nothing to do with this conversation, and yet he brings them up. He is a fucking douche by all means."
mwo,3cytj2,dugant195,3,Sun Jul 12 05:46:17 2015 UTC,So it's against Homeless Bill.
mwo,3cytj2,LeX420,2,Sun Jul 12 02:48:57 2015 UTC,It's absolutely clear from his reply that its not personal. Good luck with your five though.

mwo,3cytj2,LeX420,-1,Sun Jul 12 03:01:55 2015 UTC,It's what you got when you added 2+2.
mwo,3cytj2,InertiamanSC,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:00:33 2015 UTC,"My arithmetic might be a little off, but I'm pretty sure that 2+2=4. Not five."
mwo,3cytj2,LeX420,2,Sun Jul 12 19:15:21 2015 UTC,It's a reference to the book 1984. Why he's using it doesn't seem to make sense.
mwo,3cytj2,PseudoArab,0,Sun Jul 12 20:59:58 2015 UTC,If it was against Homeless-Bill don't you think I'd be linking to his PM box instead of one of the leaders of The Legendary Clan Smoke Jaguar?
mwo,3cytj2,pixelbaron,2,Sun Jul 12 03:15:06 2015 UTC,So then it is against CSJ.
mwo,3cytj2,LeX420,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:17:24 2015 UTC,Why are you letting the fact that cheaters were trying to steal money from the community go?
mwo,3cytj2,-ParticleMan-,-1,Wed Jul 15 20:54:47 2015 UTC,don't forget the wall hacks and heat cheats! why bother playing mechs when you can cheat your way to the top!!
mwo,3cytj2,H3LL3N,3,Sun Jul 12 02:36:43 2015 UTC,Well the game nowadays is playing pokemechs
mwo,3cytj2,J0ke,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:21:42 2015 UTC,oh BURN!!!  PGI just got rekt booyyyyyyyiiiii!
mwo,3cs4lc,Sunaja,12,Fri Jul 10 09:29:37 2015 UTC,"I'll try my best to help.   not really feeling the current trial 'Mechs, they had better ones back then for me   That is impossible because the trial mechs from 2 years ago were terrible terrible builds.  These current trial mechs are kinda player-made and PGI made them trial mechs.   The problem is, as I said I played the game way back. And at the moment, I do not own a single mech, and my C-Bill count lies at around 3 million, startet at ~1.3m when I logged in around the start of the week.   Hmmmmm.  Go to your achievements.  There should be a cadet bonus one that tells how much you earned from matches.  But then again, the achievements weren't active at the time you played.  Still check to see if it was completely used up.   there was a reset where my 'Mech(s) and/or gear got lost?   That is possible if it was during the original beta.  They did a few resets but I can't tell you if you if that's the case.   now has to snail around with the trial 'Mechs or has to first buy a cheaper mech to actually get somewhere closer to the more pricey ones, setting me back even more in my endeavour to get to one of the bigger/pricier 'Mechs?   If you spent your cadet bonus and have no more premium time.  That is sadly the case.  You will get no more cbills other then the ones you earn from trial mechs.  If you don't care for your ingame name, I recommend you start a fresh account so that you can use your cadet bonus+1 day premium time to maximize your cbills for the first day.  Since you're still new, I will give you all you need to know with these links.  Don't build mechs in the MWO client, use this: http://mwo.smurfy-net.de/  All the mech builds you can ever need here: https://www.mechspecs.com/  Find friends to help you stay alive here: http://mwomercs.com/forums/topic/27913-need-help-want-to-team-up-then-look-here/  You need to learn all of this: http://mwomercs.com/forums/topic/67854-a-s-unofficial-mechwarrior-online-field-manual/"
mwo,3cs4lc,curiousmechwarrior,5,Fri Jul 10 09:51:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for the detailed reply and the links!  I'll check my achievements later (at work right now) and see if they counted my cadet bonus there and if they somehow tracked anything. And the achievements weren't up the last time I played, you are right about that.  And yeah, I also played around the thought of just creating a new account if those things don't work.  What I meant by ""they had better ones back then for me"" was that the trial mechs available were just more to my liking. I remember that they had a Hunchback, and I just liked the Hunchback more than I do the Griffin or Trebuchet (simply personal preference). Of course, it may just be my bad memory and I actually bought the Hunchback back then and it got deleted as I assumed/questioned in my OP, but I am fairly certain that it was one of the trial mechs, that's where my statement stemmed from.  Big edit: I'm an idiot... I actually did buy two 'Mechs, Hunchback and a Spider, however  I somehow failed to notice that there is a different tab for Trial, and another for Owned 'Mechs. I just looked in 'Mech Select in the ""All"" tab and thought that it would include all 'Mechs both owned and trial versions, not seeing the two buttons on the top right that switch between those two categories..  So yes... the fault is completely my own. But at least I checked a bit more after seeing that yes, my cadet bonus matches were recorded and completed in the achievements tab, so again, thanks for pointing me in the right direction."
mwo,3cs4lc,DroopyTheSnoop,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:33:38 2015 UTC,You could also try to contact customer support about this. But I heard they're pretty slow so the best thing would be to just make a new account now and play 25 matches. You'll be richer at the end of the day by doing this.
mwo,3cs4lc,Mechronomicon,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:55:03 2015 UTC,"Seconding this comment. Since you're coming back as a relatively new player, and the game has changed a lot, you'll probably benefit from taking a spin in a few trial mechs, and this time around you can make a more informed decision about which chassis to buy first."
mwo,3cs4lc,MaChIIInA,2,Fri Jul 10 12:13:59 2015 UTC,"I believe you are incorrect about them being player made, i wasnt aware they implemented the mechs that won the polls yet...  Edit* yes, just double checked and the new champion mechs have not gone in, idk when it is supposed to happen."
mwo,3cs4lc,LordSkippy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:04:08 2015 UTC,"But then again, the achievements weren't active at the time you played. Still check to see if it was completely used up.   When the achievements were put in, they marked them complete based on how many cadet bonus matches you had left.  When they introduced the cadet bonus, they inject the C-bills for the cadet bonus for existing accounts.  If he didn't have a full 25 matches,  the achievements would show it.  Otherwise, he should have received the C-bills."
mwo,3cs4lc,erikpurne,3,Sat Jul 11 15:04:47 2015 UTC,"I do not own a single mech, and my C-Bill count lies at around 3 million   New account, for sure."
mwo,3cs4lc,Tarogato,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:10:17 2015 UTC,"So yes... the fault is completely my own.   I wouldn't say so. The Mech Select UI is absolutely atrocious right now, and not necessarily intuitive for new users. Thankfully, PGI is redoing it completely right now, so expect it to change in the next patch or three."
mwo,3cs4lc,H3LL3N,-1,Fri Jul 10 21:54:59 2015 UTC,"don't mean shit unless you get your cheats on.  yup, now it isn't just wall hacks, it isn't just the klunky aim bot, now you can have no heat, Super Radar Dep (cancels Seismic), and even ultra lag shields! What a great game PGI! Special KUDOS to Buttocks et. al for not giving a shit whatsoever!!"
