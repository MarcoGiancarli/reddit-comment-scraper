Astros,3e34is,Pockaden,4,Tue Jul 21 17:44:57 2015 UTC,So.. question. Wouldn't this be considered tampering?  Or is that not a rule in MLB?

Astros,3e3t8r,fizzle25,4,Wed Jul 22 02:22:19 2015 UTC,"Ah, so that's why he'd always stick his elbow pad out there, get hit by the pitch, and then sprint to 1st. I always assumed it was because he didn't want the ump to have time to consider that maybe he leaned into the pitch.   He was masterful at making it look like he was bailing while actually turning into it."

Astros,3e3t8r,megagoosey,4,Wed Jul 22 02:26:09 2015 UTC,"Elite defense, walks alot. Give him time to bring it back."
Astros,3e3t8r,tormentlive,6,Wed Jul 22 02:21:50 2015 UTC,I think we need to give him some time back from the DL first and see.  He looks good today at least.

Astros,3e3t8r,cmays90,4,Wed Jul 22 02:16:56 2015 UTC,Better actually. They were talking about it on the radio broadcast the other day. He is the best in the league at it
Astros,3e3t8r,fizzle25,2,Wed Jul 22 02:23:09 2015 UTC,"Last I checked, he was #2 and Conger #18.  But that changes day to day, and I didn't want to speak out of turn."

Astros,3e3t8r,fizzle25,5,Wed Jul 22 02:49:53 2015 UTC,Can we have a DH for the catcher?
Astros,3e3t8r,fizzle25,6,Wed Jul 22 02:13:22 2015 UTC,I've liked him over Castro for the last several weeks to be honest. Someone tell me I'm crazy?
Astros,3e3t8r,front_butt_coconut,5,Wed Jul 22 02:10:50 2015 UTC,"Not crazy, but Castro is a better defensive catcher at the moment."
Astros,3e3t8r,BaconYourPardon,6,Wed Jul 22 02:14:12 2015 UTC,"at the moment   Castro has pretty much always been a great defensive catcher, and right now he's in the top 3 catchers defensively (imo).  Conger is good, but not as good as Castro, so Castro is going to get the playing time."

Astros,3e2ta1,ralph1933,3,Tue Jul 21 15:11:41 2015 UTC,Who are we giving up for someone like price though?
Astros,3e2ta1,iammattchambers,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:49:35 2015 UTC,My guess would be Kemp/Santana as well as a young arm like Appel or Velasquez
Astros,3e2ta1,ostocks,3,Tue Jul 21 20:28:42 2015 UTC,There is no way we give that up for a rental.
Astros,3e2ta1,neutralvoice,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:17:09 2015 UTC,Assuming we can extend him - and we know that ahead of time (which I assume we would)  I'd be perfectly okay that. Kemp and Appel for Price?
Astros,3e2ta1,iammattchambers,5,Tue Jul 21 21:36:39 2015 UTC,Or we could just sign him in the off season for no prospects
Astros,3e2ta1,neutralvoice,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:03:40 2015 UTC,Cool with that too.
Astros,3e2ta1,iammattchambers,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:25:11 2015 UTC,He'd cost more than that.
Astros,3e2ta1,Tummysticks17,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:54:20 2015 UTC,"I can see the two position players.  Possibly Appel.  Those three should be enough.  If they ask for Velasquez that's way too much.    We have a plethora of outfielders and even if all of them become stars, we can't play them all."

Astros,3e3sjj,Makanuihoho,6,Tue Jul 21 19:05:06 2015 UTC,"There is really not a bad vantage point in the park. Crawford boxes in left field are a fan favorite, but I'm a boring first base line kind of guy. If your kids have gloves, they'd get a thrill out of potentially catching a foul ball in the lower sections. Upper sections are awesome as well, the view from the top section behind home plate is pretty amazing."
Astros,3e3sjj,AnotherMattressStore,3,Tue Jul 21 19:11:02 2015 UTC,"I've never done the Crawford boxes, but I will say that the upper deck behind home plate provides a great view of the action. Any lower section is good, but I avoid the area in the outfield foul territory (just personal preference). Outfield at Minute Maid is solid as well, however if you're going upper deck, the seats behind home plate are well worth the money."

Astros,3e3sjj,AnotherMattressStore,4,Tue Jul 21 23:34:54 2015 UTC,"Solid advice by /u/AnotherMattressStore.  Some extra points for your conisderation:  BP starts ~2.5 hrs before game time. I'd recommend showing up then (if possible).    It's much more intimate, and if your boys are the ""baseball is life"" types like I was, they'll appreciate any extra time at the park that they can get. Plus, this is the best opportunity to get an autograph or catch a HR. You can walk around after (or during) BP/warmups and check out all the unique features that make MMP one of the coolest places to catch a game. Kid's zone is located by the RF entrance. It has a few cool interactive games. This was the first thing my 9 y.o. cousin told his parents about after I took him to a game last season. He likes football more than baseball, and we lost by like 6 runs, so that may be part of it as well, but he definitely enjoyed it."

Astros,3e2c1q,buttsbot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:16:09 2015 UTC,The Price is NOT right.
Astros,3e2c1q,clutchyball,4,Tue Jul 21 16:59:10 2015 UTC,"This could be awesome (because even if we are targeting Cueto, it adds some supply to the market, and Price was quoted recently as saying he wouldnt mind playing for Houston)."
Astros,3e2c1q,DrewTip,6,Tue Jul 21 12:30:52 2015 UTC,I would give up significantly more for Price thank would for Cuento or Kazmir.  I think he would be fine being here and he would be a huge improvement to our rotation
Astros,3e2c1q,MVMTH,3,Tue Jul 21 13:15:15 2015 UTC,"In the article that talked about him and Keuchel, they seemed to get a long great and it sounded like he would be happy here."
Astros,3e2c1q,DrewTip,2,Tue Jul 21 14:38:18 2015 UTC,I think we'll have to give up Appel or Velazquez plus someone like Santana/kemp.  It would be a lot but I think it's worth it. Hopefully he likes it here and signs a big deal this offseason.  We just need to decide if he's worth it. Honestly I think we should stay with what we have and not give up any top prospects and try to add an arm in the offseason
Astros,3e2c1q,TwoChe,3,Tue Jul 21 15:09:56 2015 UTC,Appel and Kemp for Price works for me.
Astros,3e2c1q,DrewTip,2,Tue Jul 21 17:34:59 2015 UTC,This probably wouldn't be enough but would be a good start and isn't too much to give up for Price. If he signs next year after giving up these prospects it's still a win for both teams but a huge win for us
Astros,3e2c1q,cmays90,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:37:36 2015 UTC,"For a loner?  That's not an unfair package.  I could see them wanting Velazquez over Appel, but right now, they are pretty even in my eyes."
Astros,3e2c1q,DrewTip,2,Tue Jul 21 17:47:49 2015 UTC,For a loaner I could see him being very expensive. I hope he wouldn't be but he probably will be.  Let's pray Luhnow pulls off a great move
Astros,3e2c1q,cmays90,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:57:05 2015 UTC,"I doubt it's going to be that expensive.  Dave Dombrowski knows that a pitcher with a half season on contract isn't worth too much.    I mean, the Tigers ultimately gave up Austin Jackson, Drew Smyly and Willy Adames for Price for a year and a half.    Jackson being the head liner didn't even end up on the Rays, but he's about equal value wise to either Appel/Velazquez, given the service time already accrued, and Smyly is nothing but a middle-of-rotation hopefully-he-eats-up-some-innings kinda guy.  Kemp for 6 years is probably worth more than Smyly for 2 years, but that's also pretty damn close.  Price for half a season for Appel/Velazquez and Kemp/Santana makes sense for the Astros in that it simplifies in the 40 man roster quite a bit come offseason, makes them competitive now, and would be based on the thought that there's a good shot he re-signs in Houston and would be unwilling to re-sign in Detroit."

I was only 7 years old and had never seen a fight before so I was confused and scared for our guys haha. What isn't shown in this clip is that earlier in the game, Ron Gant (IIRC) came to the plate and was having some words with Eusebio. Eusebio then got up out of his squat and stood toe-to-toe with him, and Gant stuck his fingers in Eusebio's mask, causing the benches to clear. No punches were thrown at that point, but you could feel the tension for the next 2-3 innings before it finally boiled over."

Astros,3dw2q2,cweave,3,Mon Jul 20 02:11:27 2015 UTC,"It's a combination of slow step to the plate and the catcher's arm strength.   For example, no one would run on Pudge."
Astros,3dw2q2,Derpshiz,2,Mon Jul 20 01:57:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but Pudge in his prime used to call an abnormally high amount of fastballs with runners on first so nobody would run on Pudge."
Astros,3dw2q2,Mhockey1505,6,Mon Jul 20 12:58:59 2015 UTC,"Almost every team utilizes this. They rest their starting catcher every few days (often the backup catcher has one of the pitchers as ""their"" pitcher) to give them a rest. Catching is probably the most physically demanding position (unless you're George springer in the OF) and giving them consistent days off is healthy."
Astros,3dw2q2,rices4212,3,Mon Jul 20 01:43:34 2015 UTC,"Conger is a switch hitter, Castro hits lefty. Castro has struggled this season at the plate. Conger is weak defensively. I'd love to see Castro turn it around this season and get more playing time but I think right now there's an advantage to playing Conger more in some situations and neither guy is getting worn out."

There are typically lots around MMP that are cheap, but for a Rangers series they might hike the prices. If the Saturday game is at 6, I recommend finding street parking and paying for that at the meter because street parking is free after 6 PM.  The chicken and waffle cone is pretty popular, though I find it bland. I recommend trying the loaded baked potato fries though there is a salad bar located behind home plate if y'all feel like eating healthy. If you go down into the Budweiser Patio (center field), there's a bar. You could also try the St. Arnold bar in left field.  As for attractions, there are statues of Biggio and Bagwell outside the stadium near the center field entrance, set up like they're turning a double play. Check out Home Run Alley in the left field concourse and the lobby of Union Station - some cool stuff there."

Astros,3dsryj,taking_a_deuce,0,Sun Jul 19 07:07:21 2015 UTC,If Dallas gets relieved at some point the first time Odor comes up should be a bean.  However theres only one person to blame on the bench clearing.  The fucking ump.  He should have told Odor to get in the box ages before Conger even told him to.

Astros,3dsxjx,oznobz,7,Sun Jul 19 05:46:20 2015 UTC,"This is a way to ice a pitcher.  He just threw his warmup pitches, and you're supposed to get into the box in a reasonable amount of time.  Its the same logic as calling timeout on a field goal kicker.  Ump should have awarded a strike for the amount of time it took."

Astros,3dsxjx,oznobz,2,Sun Jul 19 14:37:35 2015 UTC,"There is, but most umps give a benefit of the doubt if you're right there like Odor was.  But Odor never fully entered the batter's box.  Thats why I think he should've started the count 0-1."
Astros,3dsxjx,iammattchambers,4,Sun Jul 19 14:38:43 2015 UTC,Looked like Odor was just being a dick. It did look pretty disrespectful. Your guess is as good as mine.
Astros,3dsxjx,Jmacadd,3,Sun Jul 19 07:04:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah he was just standing right outside the box, literally doing nothing other than trying to fuck with the pitcher. Fielder overreacted and tried to look like some sort of baseball white knight, and it went downhill from there."

Odor hit Altuve with a late slide early in the game, showboated on his homer, refused to get in the box, and yelled the whole way around the bases on his triple. Fielder was the first to run up on Conger and then pushed Hinch right afterwards. Yeah it's on now, the rest of the Rangers games are going to be intense!"

Astros,3dsxjx,number0011,5,Sun Jul 19 14:39:05 2015 UTC,"+15 respect level for ol' Hank.  Like kluenberg1 said, ""chickenshit slide""..... fuck Odor. That little skank"
Astros,3dsxjx,Pockaden,4,Sun Jul 19 10:47:53 2015 UTC,Is there a video of this somewhere?
Astros,3dsxjx,kluenberg1,7,Sun Jul 19 15:33:34 2015 UTC,"I've seen this Odor joker play two games in my entire life, and I already can't stand him.   Between this, the showboating on the HR, and the chickenshit slide on Altuve today; he can get fucked."
Astros,3dsxjx,durtymccurdy,5,Sun Jul 19 06:05:09 2015 UTC,When Conger stood up on him I thought he was about to. Dude's got like 50 pounds on Odor.
Astros,3dsxjx,oznobz,4,Sun Jul 19 07:35:37 2015 UTC,And was wearing Armor.
Astros,3dsxjx,Pockaden,3,Sun Jul 19 14:14:48 2015 UTC,Yea I didn't realize Cong is that big..
Astros,3dsxjx,skeptoid79,7,Sun Jul 19 15:35:06 2015 UTC,King Cong.
Astros,3dsxjx,number0011,7,Sun Jul 19 16:24:44 2015 UTC,No doubt. Odor stinks.  (too easy?)
Astros,3dsxjx,El-Tex,5,Sun Jul 19 09:13:04 2015 UTC,"yeah it was a given... too many jokes on him already. (although not in this thread)  But hey, L.J. Hoes is back in the lineup. I got next."
Astros,3drw78,Tal_Venada,24,Sat Jul 18 21:30:57 2015 UTC,"The real question is: ""Is anybody else?"""
Astros,3drw78,jdb12,6,Sat Jul 18 22:08:27 2015 UTC,CarGo left a bad taste I my mouth after the series where he decided to camp out at home and watch his homer.
Astros,3drw78,chaserjames,7,Sat Jul 18 23:10:13 2015 UTC,No joke that's the first time I've seen someone use CarGo in reference to the Brewers OF as opposed to the one who plays for the Rockies. How things change.
Astros,3drw78,donofalldons,2,Sun Jul 19 01:28:15 2015 UTC,Wait... I think I might have them confused
Astros,3drw78,chaserjames,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:43:41 2015 UTC,Gonzalez vs Gomez.
Astros,3drw78,buttsbot,8,Sun Jul 19 20:07:51 2015 UTC,But who would want him? Is it just me or is Singleton starting to remind anyone else of Brett Wallace?
Astros,3drw78,astrovinyl,5,Sun Jul 19 00:17:35 2015 UTC,Brett Wallace had no problem hitting over .200
Astros,3drw78,couldnt_careless,3,Sun Jul 19 00:47:17 2015 UTC,In the sense he's a first base prospect who has disappointed. Wallace could at least hit for average and get on base at a somewhat respectable clip (I'm being generous). Guy just had nonexistent power which is a must from a corner infielder.
Astros,3drw78,donofalldons,2,Sun Jul 19 01:31:05 2015 UTC,Singleton's contract status is going to hurt here -- who wants to pay $2m a year for someone who can't hit ML pitching?
Astros,3drw78,Shinino,2,Sun Jul 19 01:00:45 2015 UTC,"I honestly think he just needs a change of scenery.  He probably won't be worth 2 mil, but if we pay half we can probably ship him off somewhere better for his career (maybe rockies)"
Astros,3drw78,oznobz,3,Sun Jul 19 01:06:40 2015 UTC,"It's not the $2M part that really hurts, because that's fine for a bench bat. It's the number of years left on the deal."
Astros,3drw78,illegal_deagle,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:06:07 2015 UTC,"A little bit to late, should have traded him over the past offseason. He holds no value now....called this shit a year ago"
Astros,3drw78,ichru4,0,Sun Jul 19 02:20:11 2015 UTC,Great so he can go rake for some other team. But we get to keep Carter!
Astros,3dqedp,oznobz,7,Sat Jul 18 13:02:57 2015 UTC,The only setback was sliding into third later in his last game...
Astros,3dqedp,dcooley17,5,Sat Jul 18 14:03:24 2015 UTC,"I know its a few days old, but I just want to remind everyone, only 4 more weeks if theres no setbacks!"
Astros,3dqedp,gunnybears,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:03:29 2015 UTC,I thought he was out till September?
Astros,3dqedp,rices4212,2,Sat Jul 18 19:36:51 2015 UTC,"4 more weeks would be the middle of august, that's just to start rehab, so not far away"
Astros,3dqedp,clutchyball,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:38:39 2015 UTC,"It was 6 to 8 weeks before he can rehab.  Its been just over 2 weeks and if he doesn't have setbacks, it might be 4 weeks til he starts rehab."
Astros,3dqedp,Guypussy,4,Sat Jul 18 19:50:08 2015 UTC,holds breath
Astros,3dqedp,taking_a_deuce,3,Sat Jul 18 14:30:31 2015 UTC,Keeeeeeep holding...it’ll all be over soon.
Astros,3dqedp,clutchyball,3,Sat Jul 18 14:45:11 2015 UTC,"By the way clutchyball, that was a fantastic interview you gave on the podcast last week! Just wanted to let you know I enjoyed your very complex breakdown of all the butts :)"
