electronicmusic,3e2m05,Ceiiu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:19:16 2015 UTC,"So I'm going to take a break from creating tracks for a while. Right now, I feel like listening to songs rather than making any.  As every other amateur I've always been making very 'experimental' stuff that has not always been very listenable per se. But I have learned from mistakes and with each new track I make, I get a hang of it. How to use different textures and how to not overcrowd the listener etc.   However, suffice to say, I'm still not satisfied with my end-products and probably will never be. So I was going to experiment with my music-making by only listening to mainstream Top 20 stuff from Vevo for a while. Not because I like to listen to Taylor Swift (or do I!?) but because I want my music to have a certain degree of pop sensibility. I always feel inspired by what James Lavelle said about this in some interviews. He always aims to make songs that have a certain pop-sensibility to them while still being unique in their own ways.   Just wanted to express this new goal with the community.  Any thoughts on this little experiment? Or any tips?   Cheers"
electronicmusic,3e2m05,TraxOnDaRocks,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:05:28 2015 UTC,"Seems like a good idea. Don't try too hard to imitate the sound of other artists, though, and if you do, make it a mix of many.  What I tend to look at is the structure of certain songs. It's what I have most trouble with when making music myself; I have a bunch of good ideas, but for the love of me I cannot figure out how to put them together in such a way that it's enjoyable to listen to. So, I look at songs I like and I tend to imitate their structures and the ways they build up, but with completely different elements.  Still, it's pretty damn difficult for me.  Best of luck with your experiment."

I will give it you that 5 years is pushing it (massively), maybe next year or two, I don't think we've seen the peak quite yet before it burns out.  And hell, I see the potential for Americans latching onto it, they love Disclosure there and a lot of their sounds aren't too different from ones you find in Grime, could ease the transition.

Nothing against it, but I am saying many try to get big via other means than what we are actually here for. All this is a bit difficult to put in words and ultimately this meta-game skews the perception of an artist (whether he is really producing, painting or making movies) considerably imho.

Just look at how hyped Spor's return was; he did a sellout nationwide tour at a moments notice.    Currently it's only really the big cities that are experiencing a dnb revival; Birmingham, Manchester, London all have a lot of dnb stuff going on, but even my locla town which is fairly small and insignificant on the music scene has a dnb night now."
electronicmusic,3e192h,Kaael,2,Tue Jul 21 12:02:10 2015 UTC,I just want to take an extended vacation in the UK and hit up every major city's DnB scene. It's not that prevalent in America and it just breaks my heart
electronicmusic,3e192h,ripkif318,3,Tue Jul 21 12:34:42 2015 UTC,"You'd have to plan carefully to chain events, whilst it's definitely bigger here than in the US, it's by no means mainstream.

The last one you could call french house because it samples Evelynn King's Love Come Down. But those are all pretty squarely house in my mind. I'd call Nu Disco something like this.
electronicmusic,3e192h,thatsrealneato,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:01:18 2015 UTC,It is very definitively deep nu disco. Your example is as close to indie dance as it is nu disco.
electronicmusic,3e192h,Akolyte01,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:03:04 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, what exactly is a defining quality of nu disco for you? And yes I'd classify that track I posted as a blend of indie dance and nu disco. The two genres often overlap in my mind (or at least there are a lot of artists filling that space between the two genres)."
electronicmusic,3e192h,thatsrealneato,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:16:14 2015 UTC,"Drums and bassline are two definitive factors I can point to. Different from disco house in that it doesn't focus nearly as much on ""soul"" vocals, offbeat stabs, or classic strings sampling.   So Nu Disco doesn't have to sound very much like disco, unlike disco house, it just has a common lineage.

electronicmusic,3e192h,Viking-,7,Tue Jul 21 14:46:23 2015 UTC,"What strikes me as interesting is that the majority of predictions here are for sounds and genres that are far from fresh.   House?  Probably some permutation yea.  Considering its blueprint was laid down over 20 years ago though,  it's not really thinking outside the box.   Dubstep,  future bass,  trap &  grime?  All already jumped the shark.   Trance is already pop music.   What will blow up in 10 years will be something that comes from innovators,  not those recycling.   House, hip hop,  techno, jungle &  dubstep all came from urban roots &  innovation in clubbing ideals.   We won't know where the next innovation stems from."

Tropical House and G-House won't either.

electronicmusic,3e192h,iamstephano,3,Tue Jul 21 14:14:29 2015 UTC,radio doesn't determine popularity. you can pay to have your tracks played on the radio. hardwell's livesets have more views on youtube than flume's actual music. not to mention he has over 10x more followers on social media.  hardwell is much more popular than flume and it's not even close.

As for now it's hard to tell, but I'm pretty confident that someone from Skrillex's label OWSLA will grow further to popularity like it's happened in the past with Kill the Noise and Dillon Francis.

It's useful for artists to stay active online because it helps them stay in the spotlight in times when they don't post any new tracks. Another reason he got this big is that he ventured in the scene producing a relatively new genre, Moombahton ,and eventually becoming the face of it.

electronicmusic,3e192h,americandream1159,0,Tue Jul 21 06:22:45 2015 UTC,"I can somewhat understand why you would compare Daft Punk with those two, looking at their legacy, but Justice? Not really comparable imo."
electronicmusic,3e192h,TraxOnDaRocks,2,Tue Jul 21 12:10:17 2015 UTC,"Ppl know songs. D.A.N.C.E., Genesis, and the whole new movie called ""We Are Your Friends""."
electronicmusic,3e192h,americandream1159,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:15:53 2015 UTC,"People also know Calvin Harris' songs, but that doesn't make him a founding father.  Not saying Justice is at Calvin Harris' level (which would not be a good thing), but I - without too much Daft Punk fanboy-ism - just don't think Justice has been nearly as influential as Daft Punk in bringing a genre to the masses, or anything like that."
electronicmusic,3e192h,TraxOnDaRocks,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:23:31 2015 UTC,"Absolutely not, they haven't. But their name is pretty well established. Before I got into Electronic, I still knew ""bwaaaaaaaaah-weh-neh-beh-beh-weh-neh-beh-beh-weh-waaaaaaaaaaah""."

electronicmusic,3e192h,maaaaadeline,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:10:35 2015 UTC,"I think the EDM craze is starting to die down. People are going back to hiphop and more ""traditional"" genres.. Which is both a good and bad thing."
electronicmusic,3e192h,MatteFFS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:57:09 2015 UTC,"Don't know exactly what will be the next craze but I think it will be of a fast tempo. Possibly something influenced by trance or breaks. Genres aside, popular electronic music over the years has, by and large, gone slow-fast-slow-fast etc. It's fairly cyclical."
electronicmusic,3e192h,moloizer,0,Tue Jul 21 11:01:38 2015 UTC,"Big beat.  Don't ask me why. This is just a wild guess. It would be pretty cool, though."
electronicmusic,3e192h,TraxOnDaRocks,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:07:15 2015 UTC,"Probably a fusion genre between two popular genres at the moment. Say something like ""Future Trap"" or ""Future Big Room"" or some shit like that. Hopefully some more instrumental hip hop artists come to light with a similar style of music to Pretty Lights or Nujabes for example but I really don't see people wanting a less wild approach to music."

electronicmusic,3e192h,bixiedust102,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:45:47 2015 UTC,I think progressive/electro house will always be a huge crowd pleaser for years to come and I think probably two of the most underrated producers is Audien and Madeon rn. I can definitely see one of them rising to the top of the DJ Mag 100 in 5-10 years; not that I particularly agree with DJ Mag's rankings sometimes but I wouldn't be mad seeing one of them in the Top 5.

electronicmusic,3e192h,snocroft,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:03:27 2015 UTC,"There are a few ways things can go down. Hardstyle has been steadily gaining popularity here in the US. Thanks to artists like Brennan Heart, Code Black, Wildstylez, and Audiotricz pushing a more mainstream sound. The American crowd is jumping on the hardstyle buzz lately. It's more energetic than Trap or ""Big Room"", so I see it as a nice choice for people who want to rage and have ""pop"" like music.  Maybe it's a genre that doesn't exist yet. 5 years ago Trap music didn't exist in EDM. Maybe people will make Electronic music from something cool. Who knows, maybe Acid makes a comeback!"
electronicmusic,3e192h,alex54231,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:28:02 2015 UTC,"Very intriguing answers! Love it.   Now here's my next question, how do these trends tend to move from country to country? I see varying answers depending on location. I would assume European trends eventually make their way to the U.S. Would this be an accurate observation? I understand the next big hit can pop up anywhere, but there certainly has to be a trend in terms of who is inspiring who, and where the ""freshest"" beats are gaining the most traction. I'm from the US and would love some perspective :)"
electronicmusic,3e192h,Ceiiu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:55:03 2015 UTC,"Not really electronic, but Northern Soul and Funk seems to be popular again now because of Jungle. I listened to those guys in a Gilles Peterson radio mix and ever since then they have accumulated such a wide base of fans. Touring endlessly and getting even bigger gigs. So we might see some sort of fusion between electronic and northern soul."
electronicmusic,3e192h,MasterofPandas1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:29:58 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I hope the PC Music collective just flips everything on its head. There's already little signs that it might with their SXSW show and Pop Cube showing they can put on a unique experience. Plus SOPHIE (whose closely related) helped produce Bitch I'm Madonna with Diplo, his song Lemonade is in a McDonald's commercial, and he mentioned the Rolling Stone interview him and A.G. Cook did that he was talking with Miley's camp. Diplo also did a remix of Hey Q.T. so there's that too."

electronicmusic,3e192h,Torpedoe,3,Tue Jul 21 12:17:39 2015 UTC,"House has been the go-to popular genre since at least 2008.  From Progressive House, through Big Room House, to Future House today."
electronicmusic,3e192h,Open_Eye_Signal,18,Tue Jul 21 06:12:37 2015 UTC,"Try ""since at least 1984""."
electronicmusic,3e192h,Torpedoe,2,Tue Jul 21 06:48:24 2015 UTC,"Before that there were period when, for example, Trance was more popular. That's what I mean. House has been completely undisputed in the last 10ish years."
electronicmusic,3e192h,mrmanny0099,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:53:15 2015 UTC,"Trance didn't exist until the late 80s to early 90s with producers like age of love, jam & spoon, dance2trance and others, but yeah, there was a point where trance was more popular than house."
electronicmusic,3e192h,TraxOnDaRocks,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:06:43 2015 UTC,"I think he meant ""before 2008"", not 1984."

electronicmusic,3e37u4,empw,2,Tue Jul 21 19:15:39 2015 UTC,"I maintain that Swedish House Mafia - Until Now is legitimately one of the greatest mix albums ever made, and the perfect ""entry level"" music for getting into electronic stuff.    I miss when the SHM style was the popular stuff.  Maybe its just because thats when i was getting into all this, but I find it so much more enjoyable than the current Hardwell/DVLM bigroom shit.  At least you could actually differentiate between SHM songs and they had actual melodies and differing structures, and they certainly knew how to put together a good mainstage set.  Now it feels like its just Zedd vocal - THUMP THUMP THUMP - Calvin Harris vocal - THUMP THUMP THUMP - are you reeaddddyyyyy - THUMP THUMP THUMP - another Zedd vocal - THUMP THUMP THUMP oh wait theres a new DJ on the decks now?  I thought we just heard thi - THUMP THUMP THUMP"
electronicmusic,3e37u4,sp0ck06,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:50:31 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Coming from a purely rock, jazz and hiphop background the stuff that SHM and Kaskade, etc. were doing immediately drew me in. I had never heard anything like it in terms of chord progressions and sounds they used.  And yeah, I'm not completely sure whether it's just nostalgia for that feeling of discovery, but I kinda miss that blowup from 2011-2013 when Avicii & SHM style stuff was more popular. Even Avicii has changed his style to folksy-electropop or whatever now. The only recent song that kinda took me back was Break through the Silence by Garrix and Mattise & Sadko. Other than that I'm just sticking to anjunadeep-type stuff right now."
